<h4 id="chapter-vii-the-self-and-the-common-world">CHAPTER VII THE SELF
AND THE COMMON WORLD</h4>
<p>IT IS CUSTOMARY for the authors of epistemological treatises to
assume that our empirical knowledge must have a basis of certainty, and
that there must therefore be objects whose existence is logically
indubitable. And they believe, for the most part, that it is their
business, not merely to describe these objects, which they regard as
being immediately “given” to us, but also to provide a logical proof of
the existence of objects which are not so “given.” For they think that
without such a proof the greater part of our so-called empirical
knowledge will lack the certification which it logically requires.</p>
<p>To those who have followed the argument of this book it will,
however, be clear that these familiar assumptions are mistaken. For we
have seen that our claims to empirical knowledge are not susceptible of
a logical, but only of a pragmatic, justification. It is futile, and
therefore illegitimate, to demand an a priori proof of the existence of
objects which are not immediately “given.” For, unless they are
metaphysical objects, the occurrence of certain sense-experiences will
itself constitute the only proof of their existence which is requisite
or obtainable; and the question whether the appropriate
sense-experiences do or do not occur in the relevant circumstances is
one that must be decided in actual practice, and not by any a priori
argumentation. We have already applied these considerations to the
so-called problem of perception, and we shall shortly be applying them
also to the traditional “problems” of our knowledge of our own
existence, and of the existence of other people. In the case of the
problem of perception, we found that in order to avoid metaphysics we
were obliged to adopt a phenomenalist standpoint, and we shall find that
the same treatment must be accorded to the other problems to which we
have just now referred.</p>
<p>We have seen, furthermore, that there are no objects whose existence
is indubitable. For, since existence is not a predicate, to assert that
an object exists is always to assert a synthetic proposition; and it has
been shown that no synthetic propositions are logically sacrosanct. All
of them, including the propositions which describe the content of our
sensations, are hypotheses which, however great their probability, we
may eventually find it expedient to abandon. And this means that our
empirical knowledge cannot have a basis of logical certainty. It
follows, indeed, from the definition of a synthetic proposition that it
cannot be either proved or disproved by formal logic. The man who denies
such a proposition may be acting irrationally, by contemporary standards
of rationality, but he is not necessarily contradicting himself. And we
know that the only propositions that are certain are those which cannot
be denied without self-contradiction, inasmuch as they are
tautologies.</p>
<p>It must not be thought that in denying that our empirical knowledge
has a basis of certainty we are denying that any objects are really
“given.” For to say that an object is immediately “given” is to say
merely that it is the content of a sense-experience, and we are very far
from maintaining that our sense-experiences have no real content, or
even that their content is in any way indescribable. All that we are
maintaining in this connection is that any description of the content of
any sense-experience is an empirical hypothesis of whose validity there
can be no guarantee. And this is by no means equivalent to maintaining
that no such hypothesis can actually be valid. We shall not, indeed,
attempt to formulate any such hypotheses ourselves, because the
discussion of psychological questions is out of place in a philosophical
enquiry; and we have already made it clear that our empiricism is not
logically dependent on an atomistic psychology, such as Hume and Mach
adopted, but is compatible with any theory whatsoever concerning the
actual characteristics of our sensory fields. For the empiricist
doctrine to which we are committed is a logical doctrine concerning the
distinction between analytic propositions, synthetic propositions, and
metaphysical verbiage; and as such it has no bearing on any
psychological question of fact.</p>
<p>It is not possible, however, to set aside all the questions which
philosophers have raised in connection with the “given” as being
psychological in character, and so outside the scope of this enquiry. In
particular, it is impossible to deal in this way with the question
whether sense-contents are mental or physical, or with the question
whether they are in any sense private to a single self, or with the
question whether they can exist without being experienced. For none of
these three questions is capable of being solved by an empirical test.
They must, if they are soluble at all, be soluble a priori. And as they
are all questions which have given rise to much dispute among
philosophers, we shall in fact attempt to provide for each of them a
definitive a priori solution.</p>
<p>To begin with, we must make it clear that we do not accept the
realist analysis of our sensations in terms of subject, act, and object.
For neither the existence of the substance which is supposed to perform
the so-called act of sensing nor the existence of the act itself, as an
entity distinct from the sense-contents on which it is supposed to be
directed, is in the least capable of being verified. We do not deny,
indeed, that a given sense-content can legitimately be said to be
experienced by a particular subject; but we shall see that this relation
of being experienced by a particular subject is to be analysed in terms
of the relationship of sense-contents to one another, and not in terms
of a substantival ego and its mysterious acts. Accordingly we define a
sense-content not as the object, but as a part of a sense-experience.
And from this it follows that the existence of a sense-content always
entails the existence of a sense-experience.</p>
<p>It is necessary, at this point, to remark that when one says that a
sense-experience, or a sense-content, exists, one is making a different
type of statement from that which one makes when one says that a
material thing exists. For the existence of a material thing is defined
in terms of the actual and possible occurrence of the sense-contents
which constitute it as a logical construction, and one cannot
significantly speak of a sense-experience, which is a whole composed of
sense-contents, or of a sense-content itself as if it were a logical
construction out of sense-contents. And in fact when we say that a given
sense-content or sense-experience exists, we are saying no more than
that it occurs. And, accordingly, it seems advisable always to speak of
the “occurrence” of sense-contents and sense-experiences in preference
to speaking of their “existence,” and so to avoid the danger of treating
sense-contents as if they were material things.</p>
<p>The answer to the question whether sense-contents are mental or
physical is that they are neither; or rather, that the distinction
between what is mental and what is physical does not apply to
sense-contents. It applies only to objects which are logical
constructions out of them. But what differentiates one such logical
construction from another is the fact that it is constituted by
different sense-contents or by sense-contents differently related. So
that when we distinguish a given mental object from a given physical
object, or a mental object from another mental object, or a physical
object from another physical object, we are in every case distinguishing
between different logical constructions whose elements cannot themselves
be said to be either mental or physical. It is, indeed, not impossible
for a sense-content to be an element both of a mental and of a physical
object; but it is necessary that some of the elements, or some of the
relations, should be different in the two logical constructions. And it
may be advisable here to repeat that, when we refer to an object as a
logical construction out of certain sense-contents, we are not saying
that it is actually constructed out of those sense-contents, or that the
sense-contents are in any way parts of it, but are merely expressing, in
a convenient, if somewhat misleading, fashion, the syntactical fact that
all sentences referring to it are translatable into sentences referring
to them.</p>
<p>The fact that the distinction between mind and matter applies only to
logical constructions and that all distinctions between logical
constructions are reducible to distinctions between sense-contents,
proves that the difference between the entire class of mental objects
and the entire class of physical objects is not in any sense more
fundamental than the difference between any two subclasses of mental
objects, or the difference between any two subclasses of physical
objects. Actually, the distinguishing feature of the objects belonging
to the category of “one’s own mental states” is the fact that they are
mainly constituted by “introspective” sense-contents and by
sense-contents which are elements of one’s own body; and the
distinguishing feature of the objects belonging to the category of “the
mental states of others” is the fact that they are mainly constituted by
sense-contents which are elements of other living bodies; and what makes
one unite these two classes of objects to form the single class of
mental objects is the fact that there is a high degree of qualitative
similarity between many of the sense-contents which are elements of
other living bodies and many of the elements of one’s own. But we are
not now concerned with the provision of an exact definition of
“mentality.” We are interested only in making it plain that the
distinction between mind and matter, applying as it does to logical
constructions out of sense-contents, cannot apply to sense-contents
themselves. For a distinction between logical constructions which is
constituted by the fact that there are certain distinctions between
their elements is clearly of a different type from any distinction that
can obtain between the elements.</p>
<p>It should be clear, also, that there is no philosophical problem
concerning the relationship of mind and matter, other than the
linguistic problems of defining certain symbols which denote logical
constructions in terms of symbols which denote sense-contents. The
problems with which philosophers have vexed themselves in the past,
concerning the possibility of bridging the “gulf” between mind and
matter in knowledge or in action, are all fictitious problems arising
out of the senseless metaphysical conception of mind and matter, or
minds and material things, as “substances.” Being freed from
metaphysics, we see that there can be no a priori objections to the
existence either of causal or of epistemological connections between
minds and material things. For, roughly speaking, all that we are saying
when we say that the mental state of a person A at a time t is a state
of awareness of a material thing X, is that the sense-experience which
is the element of A occurring at time t contains a sense-content which
is an element of X, and also certain images which define A’s expectation
of the occurrence in suitable circumstances of certain further elements
of X, and that this expectation is correct: and what we are saying when
we assert that a mental object M and a physical object X are causally
connected is that, in certain conditions, the occurrence of a certain
sort of sense-content, which is an element of M, is a reliable sign of
the occurrence of a certain sort of sense-content, which is an element
of X, or vice versa, And the question whether any propositions of these
kinds are true or not is clearly an empirical question. It cannot be
decided, as metaphysicians have attempted to decide it, a priori.</p>
<p>We turn now to consider the question of the subjectivity of
sense-contents—that is, to consider whether it is or is not logically
possible for a sense-content to occur in the sense-history of more than
a single self. And in order to decide this question we must proceed to
give an analysis of the notion of a self.</p>
<p>The problem which now confronts us is analogous to the problem of
perception with which we have already dealt. We know that a self, if it
is not to be treated as a metaphysical entity, must be held to be a
logical construction out of sense-experiences. It is, in fact, a logical
construction out of the sense-experiences which constitute the actual
and possible sense-history of a self. And, accordingly, if we ask what
is the nature of the self, we are asking what is the relationship that
must obtain between sense-experiences for them to belong to the
sense-history of the same self. And the answer to this question is that
for any two sense-experiences to belong to the sense-history of the same
self it is necessary and sufficient that they should contain organic
sense-contents which are elements of the same body.93 But, as it is
logically impossible for any organic sense-content to be an element of
more than one body, the relation of “belonging to the sense-history of
the same self” turns out to be a symmetrical and transitive relation.94
And, from the fact that the relation of belonging to the sense-history
of the same self is symmetrical and transitive, it follows necessarily
that the series of sense-experiences which constitute the
sense-histories of different selves cannot have any members in common.
And this is tantamount to saying that it is logically impossible for a
sense-experience to belong to the sense-history of more than a single
self. But if all sense-experiences are subjective, then, all
sense-contents are subjective. For it is necessary by definition for a
sense-content to be contained in a single sense-experience.</p>
<p>To many people, the account of the self, on which this conclusion
depends, will no doubt appear paradoxical. For it is still fashionable
to regard the self as a substance. But, when one comes to enquire into
the nature of this substance, one finds that it is an entirely
unobservable entity. It may be suggested that it is revealed in
self-consciousness but this is not the case. For all that is involved in
self-consciousness is the ability of a self to remember some of its
earlier states. And to say that a self A is able to remember some of its
earlier states is to say merely that some of the sense-experiences which
constitute A contain memory images which correspond to sense-contents
which have previously occurred in the sense-history of A.95 And thus we
find that the possibility of self-consciousness in no way involves the
existence of a substantive ego. But if the substantive ego is not
revealed in self-consciousness, it is not revealed anywhere. The
existence of such an entity is completely unverifiable. And accordingly,
we must conclude that the assumption of its existence is no less
metaphysical than Locke’s discredited assumption of the existence of a
material substratum. For it is clearly no more significant to assert
that an “unobservable somewhat” underlies the sensations which are the
sole empirical manifestations of the self than it is to assert that an
“unobservable somewhat” underlies the sensations which are the sole
empirical manifestations of a material thing. The considerations which
make it necessary, as Berkeley saw, to give a phenomenalist account of
material things, make it necessary also, as Berkeley did not see, to
give a phenomenalist account of the self.</p>
<p>Our reasoning on this point, as on so many others, is in conformity
with Hume’s. He, too, rejected the notion of a substantive ego on the
ground that no such entity was observable. For, he said, whenever he
entered most intimately into what he called himself, he always stumbled
on some particular perception or other—of heat or cold, light or shade,
love or hatred, pain or pleasure. He never could catch himself at any
time without a perception, and never could observe anything but the
perception. And this led him to assert that a self was “nothing but a
bundle or collection of different perceptions.“96 But, having asserted
this, he found himself unable to discover the principle on which
innumerable distinct perceptions among which it was impossible to
perceive any “real connection” were united to form a single self. He saw
that the memory must be regarded not as producing, but rather as
discovering, personal identity—or, in other words, that, whereas
self-consciousness has to be defined in terms of memory, self-identity
cannot be; for the number of my perceptions which I can remember at any
time always falls far short of the number of those which have actually
occurred in my history, and those which I cannot remember are no less
constitutive of my self than those which I can. But having, on this
ground, rejected the claim of memory to be the unifying principle of the
self, Hume was obliged to confess that he did not know what was the
connection between perceptions in virtue of which they formed a single
self.97 And this confession has often been taken by rationalist authors
as evidence that it is impossible for a consistent empiricist to give a
satisfactory account of the self.</p>
<p>For our part, we have shown that this charge against empiricism is
unfounded. For we have solved Hume’s problem by defining personal
identity in terms of bodily identity, and bodily identity is to be
defined in terms of the resemblance and continuity of sense-contents.
And this procedure is justified by the fact that whereas it is
permissible, in our language, to speak of a man as surviving a complete
loss of memory, or a complete change of character, it is
self-contradictory to speak of a man as surviving the annihilation of
his body.98 For that which is supposed to survive by those who look
forward to a “life after death” is not the empirical self, but a
metaphysical entity—the soul. And this metaphysical entity, concerning
which no genuine hypothesis can be formulated, has no logical connection
whatsoever with the self.</p>
<p>It must, however, be remarked that, although we have vindicated
Hume’s contention that it is necessary to give a phenomenalist account
of the nature of the self, our actual definition of the self is not a
mere restatement of his. For we do not hold, as he apparently did, that
the self is an aggregate of sense-experiences, or that the
sense-experiences which constitute a particular self are in any sense
parts of it. What we hold is that the self is reducible to
sense-experiences, in the sense that to say anything about the self is
always to say something about sense-experiences; and our definition of
personal identity is intended to show how this reduction could be
made.</p>
<p>In thus combining a thoroughgoing phenomenalism with the admission
that all sense-experiences, and the sense-contents which form part of
them, are private to a single self, we are pursuing a course to which
the following objection is likely to be raised. It will be said that
anyone who maintains both that all empirical knowledge resolves itself
on analysis into knowledge of the relationships of sense-contents, and
also that the whole of a man’s sense-history is private to himself, is
logically obliged to be a solipsist—that is, to hold that no other
people besides himself exist, or at any rate that there is no good
reason to suppose that any other people beside himself exist. For it
follows from his premises, so it will be argued, that the
sense-experiences of another person cannot possibly form part of his own
experience, and consequently that he cannot have the slightest ground
for believing in their occurrence; and, in that case, if people are
nothing but logical constructions out of their sense-experiences, he
cannot have the slightest ground for believing in the existence of any
other people. And it will be said that even if such a solipsistic
doctrine cannot be shown to be self-contradictory, it is nevertheless
known to be false99</p>
<p>I propose to meet this objection, not by denying that solipsism is
known to be false, but by denying that it is a necessary consequence of
our epistemology. I am, indeed, prepared to admit that if the
personality of others was something that I could not possibly observe,
then I should have no reason to believe in the existence of anyone else.
And in admitting this I am conceding a point which would not, I think,
be conceded by the majority of those philosophers who hold, as we do,
that a sense-content cannot belong to the sense-history of more than a
single self. They would maintain, on the contrary, that, although one
cannot in any sense observe the existence of other people, one can
nevertheless infer their existence with a high degree of probability
from one’s own experiences. They would say that my observation of a body
whose behaviour resembled the behaviour of my own body entitled me to
think it probable that that body was related to a self which I could not
observe, in the same way as my body was related to my own observable
self. And in saying this, they would be attempting to answer not the
psychological question, What causes me to believe in the existence of
other people? but the logical question, What good reason have I for
believing in the existence of other people? So that their view cannot be
refuted, as is sometimes supposed, by an argument which shows that
infants come by their belief in the existence of other people
intuitively, and not through a process of inference. For although my
belief in a certain proposition may in fact be causally dependent on my
apprehension of the evidence which makes the belief rational, it is not
necessary that it should be. It is not self contradictory to say that
beliefs for which there are rational grounds are frequently arrived at
by irrational means.</p>
<p>The correct way to refute this view that I can use an argument from
analogy, based on the fact that there is a perceptible resemblance
between the behaviour of other bodies and that of my own, to justify a
belief in the existence of other people whose experiences I could not
conceivably observe, is to point out that no argument can render
probable a completely unverifiable hypothesis. I can legitimately use an
argument from analogy to establish the probable existence of an object
which has never in fact manifested itself in my experience, provided
that the object is such that it could conceivably be manifested in my
experience. If this condition is not fulfilled, then, as far as I am
concerned, the object is a metaphysical object, and the assertion that
it exists and has certain properties is a metaphysical assertion. And,
since a metaphysical assertion is senseless, no argument can possibly
render it probable. But, on the view which we are discussing, I must
regard other people as metaphysical objects; for it is assumed that
their experiences are completely inaccessible to my observation.</p>
<p>The conclusion to be drawn from this is not that the existence of
other people is for me a metaphysical, and so fictitious, hypothesis,
but that the assumption that other people’s experiences are completely
inaccessible to my observation is false; just as the conclusion to be
drawn from the fact that Locke’s notion of a material substratum is
metaphysical is not that all the assertions which we make about material
things are nonsensical, but that Locke’s analysis of the concept of a
material thing is false. And just as I must define material things and
my own self in terms of their empirical manifestations, so I must define
other people in terms of their empirical manifestations—that is, in
terms of the behaviour of their bodies, and ultimately in terms of
sense-contents. The assumption that “behind” these sense-contents there
are entities which are not even in principle accessible to my
observation can have no more significance for me than the admittedly
metaphysical assumption that such entities “underlie” the sense-contents
which constitute material things for me, or my own self. And thus I find
that I have as good a reason to believe in the existence of other people
as I have to believe in the existence of material things. For in each
case my hypothesis is verified by the occurrence in my sense-history of
the appropriate series of sense-contents.100</p>
<p>It must not be thought that this reduction of other people’s
experiences to one’s own in any way involves a denial of their reality.
Each of us must define the experiences of the others in terms of what he
can at least in principle observe, but this does not mean that each of
us must regard all the others as so many robots. On the contrary, the
distinction between a conscious man and an unconscious machine resolves
itself into a distinction between different types of perceptible
behaviour. The only ground I can have for asserting that an object which
appears to be a conscious being is not really a conscious being, but
only a dummy or a machine, is that it fails to satisfy one of the
empirical tests by which the presence or absence of consciousness is
determined. If I know that an object behaves in every way as a conscious
being must, by definition, behave, then I know that it is really
conscious. And this is an analytical proposition. For when I assert that
an object is conscious I am asserting no more than that it would, in
response to any conceivable test, exhibit the empirical manifestations
of consciousness. I am not making a metaphysical postulate concerning
the occurrence of events which I could not, even in principle,
observe.</p>
<p>It appears, then, that the fact that a man’s sense-experiences are
private to himself, inasmuch as each of them contains an organic
sense-content which belongs to his body and to no other, is perfectly
compatible with his having good reason to believe in the existence of
other men. For, if he is to avoid metaphysics, he must define the
existence of other men in terms of the actual and hypothetical
occurrence of certain sense-contents, and then the fact that the
requisite sense-contents do occur in his sense-history gives him a good
reason for believing that there are other conscious beings besides
himself. And thus we see that the philosophical problem of “our
knowledge of other people” is not the insoluble, and, indeed,
fictitious, problem of establishing by argument the existence of
entities which are altogether unobservable, but is simply the problem of
indicating the way in which a certain type of hypothesis is empirically
verified.101</p>
<p>It must be made clear, finally, that our phenomenalism is compatible
not merely with the fact that each of us has good reason to believe that
there exist a number of conscious beings of the same kind as himself,
but also with the fact that each of us has good reason to believe that
these beings communicate with one another and with him, and inhabit a
common world. For it might appear, at first sight, as if the view that
all synthetic propositions ultimately referred to sense-contents,
coupled with the view that no sense-content could belong to the
sense-history of more than one person, implied that no one could have
any good reason to believe that a synthetic proposition ever had the
same literal meaning for any other person as it had for himself. That
is, it might be thought that if each person’s experiences were private
to himself, no one could have good reason to believe that any other
person’s experiences were qualitatively the same as his own, and
consequently that no one could have good reason to believe that the
propositions which he understood, referring as they did to the contents
of his own sense-experiences, were ever understood in the same way by
anybody else.102 But this reasoning would be fallacious. It does not
follow from the fact that each man’s experiences are private to himself
that no one ever has good reason to believe that another man’s
experiences are qualitatively the same as his own. For we define the
qualitative identity and difference of two people’s sense-experiences in
terms of the similarity and dissimilarity of their reactions to
empirical tests. To determine, for instance, whether two people have the
same colour sense we observe whether they classify all the colour
expanses with which they are confronted in the same way; and, when we
say that a man is colour-blind, what we are asserting is that he
classifies certain colour expanses in a different way from that in which
they would be classified by the majority of people. It may be objected
that the fact that two people classify colour expanses in the same way
proves only that their colour worlds have the same structure, and not
that they have the same content; that it is possible for another man to
assent to every proposition which I make about colours on the basis of
entirely different colour sensations, although, since the difference is
systematic, neither of us is ever in a position to detect it. But the
answer to this is that each of us has to define the content of another
man’s sense-experiences in terms of what he can himself observe. If he
regards the experiences of others as essentially unobservable entities,
whose nature has somehow to be inferred from the subjects’ perceptible
behaviour, then, as we have seen, even the proposition that there are
other conscious beings becomes for him a metaphysical hypothesis.
Accordingly, it is a mistake to draw a distinction between the structure
and the content of people’s sensations—such as that the structure alone
is accessible to the observation of others, the content inaccessible.
For if the contents of other people’s sensations really were
inaccessible to my observation, then I could never say anything about
them. But, in fact, I do make significant statements about them; and
that is because I define them, and the relations between them, in terms
of what I can myself observe.</p>
<p>In the same way, each of us has good reason to suppose that other
people understand him, and that he understands them, because he observes
that his utterances have the effect on their actions which he regards as
appropriate, and that they also regard as appropriate the effect which
their utterances have on his actions; and mutual understanding is
defined in terms of such harmony of behaviour. And, since to assert that
two people inhabit a common world is to assert that they are capable, at
least in principle, of understanding one another, it follows that each
of us, although his sense-experiences are private to himself, has good
reason to believe that he and other conscious beings inhabit a common
world. For each of us observes the behaviour, on the part of himself and
others, which constitutes the requisite understanding. And there is
nothing in our epistemology which involves a denial of this fact.</p>
