<h4 id="chapter-vi-critique-of-ethics-and-theology">CHAPTER VI CRITIQUE
OF ETHICS AND THEOLOGY</h4>
<p>THERE IS STILL one objection to be met before we can claim to have
justified our view that all synthetic propositions are empirical
hypotheses. This objection is based on the common supposition that our
speculative knowledge is of two distinct kinds—that which relates to
questions of empirical fact, and that which relates to questions of
value. It will be said that “statements of value” are genuine synthetic
propositions, but that they cannot with any show of justice be
represented as hypotheses, which are used to predict the course of our
sensations; and, accordingly, that the existence of ethics and
aesthetics as branches of speculative knowledge presents an insuperable
objection to our radical empiricist thesis.</p>
<p>In face of this objection, it is our business to give an account of
“judgements of value” which is both satisfactory in itself and
consistent with our general empiricist principles. We shall set
ourselves to show that in so far as statements of value are significant,
they are ordinary “scientific” statements; and that in so far as they
are not scientific, they are not in the literal sense significant, but
are simply expressions of emotion which can be neither true nor false.
In maintaining this view, we may confine ourselves for the present to
the case of ethical statements. What is said about them will be found to
apply, mutatis mutandis, to the case of aesthetic statements also.90</p>
<p>The ordinary system of ethics, as elaborated in the works of ethical
philosophers, is very far from being a homogeneous whole. Not only is it
apt to contain pieces of metaphysics, and analyses of non-ethical
concepts: its actual ethical contents are themselves of very different
kinds. We may divide them, indeed, into four main classes. There are,
first of all, propositions which express definitions of ethical terms,
or judgements about the legitimacy or possibility of certain
definitions. Secondly, there are propositions describing the phenomena
of moral experience, and their causes. Thirdly, there are exhortations
to moral virtue. And, lastly, there are actual ethical judgements. It is
unfortunately the case that the distinction between these four classes,
plain as it is, is commonly ignored by ethical philosophers; with the
result that it is often very difficult to tell from their works what it
is that they are seeking to discover or prove.</p>
<p>In fact, it is easy to see that only the first of our four classes,
namely that which comprises the propositions relating to the definitions
of ethical terms, can be said to constitute ethical philosophy. The
propositions which describe the phenomena of moral experience, and their
causes, must be assigned to the science of psychology, or sociology. The
exhortations to moral virtue are not propositions at all, but
ejaculations or commands which are designed to provoke the reader to
action of a certain sort. Accordingly, they do not belong to any branch
of philosophy or science. As for the expressions of ethical judgements,
we have not yet determined how they should be classified. But inasmuch
as they are certainly neither definitions nor comments upon definitions,
nor quotations, we may say decisively that they do not belong to ethical
philosophy. A strictly philosophical treatise on ethics should therefore
make no ethical pronouncements. But it should, by giving an analysis of
ethical terms, show what is the category to which all such
pronouncements belong. And this is what we are now about to do.</p>
<p>A question which is often discussed by ethical philosophers is
whether it is possible to find definitions which would reduce all
ethical terms to one or two fundamental terms. But this question, though
it undeniably belongs to ethical philosophy, is not relevant to our
present enquiry. We are not now concerned to discover which term, within
the sphere of ethical terms, is to be taken as fundamental; whether, for
example, “good” can be defined in terms of “right” or “right” in terms
of “good,” or both in terms of “value.” What we are interested in is the
possibility of reducing the whole sphere of ethical terms to non-ethical
terms. We are enquiring whether statements of ethical value can be
translated into statements of empirical fact.</p>
<p>That they can be so translated is the contention of those ethical
philosophers who are commonly called subjectivists, and of those who are
known as utilitarians. For the utilitarian defines the rightness of
actions, and the goodness of ends, in terms of the pleasure, or
happiness, or satisfaction, to which they give rise; the subjectivist,
in terms of the feelings of approval which a certain person, or group of
people, has towards them. Each of these types of definition makes moral
judgements into a sub-class of psychological or sociological judgements;
and for this reason they are very attractive to us. For, if either was
correct, it would follow that ethical assertions were not generically
different from the factual assertions which are ordinarily contrasted
with them; and the account which we have already given of empirical
hypotheses would apply to them also.</p>
<p>Nevertheless we shall not adopt either a subjectivist or a
utilitarian analysis of ethical terms. We reject the subjectivist view
that to call an action right, or a thing good, is to say that it is
generally approved of, because it is not self-contradictory to assert
that some actions which are generally approved of are not right, or that
some things which are generally approved of are not good. And we reject
the alternative subjectivist view that a man who asserts that a certain
action is right, or that a certain thing is good, is saying that he
himself approves of it, on the ground that a man who confessed that he
sometimes approved of what was bad or wrong would not be contradicting
himself. And a similar argument is fatal to utilitarianism. We cannot
agree that to call an action right is to say that of all the actions
possible in the circumstances it would cause, or be likely to cause, the
greatest happiness, or the greatest balance of pleasure over pain, or
the greatest balance of satisfied over unsatisfied desire, because we
find that it is not self-contradictory to say that it is sometimes wrong
to perform the action which would actually or probably cause the
greatest happiness, or the greatest balance of pleasure over pain, or of
satisfied over unsatisfied desire. And since it is not
self-contradictory to say that some pleasant things are not good, or
that some bad things are desired, it cannot be the case that the
sentence “x is good” is equivalent to “x is pleasant,” or to “x is
desired.” And to every other variant of utilitarianism with which I am
acquainted the same objection can be made. And therefore we should, I
think, conclude that the validity of ethical judgements is not
determined by the felicific tendencies of actions, any more than by the
nature of people’s feelings; but that it must be regarded as “absolute”
or “intrinsic,” and not empirically calculable.</p>
<p>If we say this, we are not, of course, denying that it is possible to
invent a language in which all ethical symbols are definable in
non-ethical terms, or even that it is desirable to invent such a
language and adopt it in place of our own; what we are denying is that
the suggested reduction of ethical to non-ethical statements is
consistent with the conventions of our actual language. That is, we
reject utilitarianism and subjectivism, not as proposals to replace our
existing ethical notions by new ones, but as analyses of our existing
ethical notions. Our contention is simply that, in our language,
sentences which contain normative ethical symbols are not equivalent to
sentences which express psychological propositions, or indeed empirical
propositions of any kind.</p>
<p>It is advisable here to make it plain that it is only normative
ethical symbols, and not descriptive ethical symbols, that are held by
us to be indefinable in factual terms. There is a danger of confusing
these two types of symbols, because they are commonly constituted by
signs of the same sensible form. Thus a complex sign of the form “x is
wrong” may constitute a sentence which expresses a moral judgement
concerning a certain type of conduct, or it may constitute a sentence
which states that a certain type of conduct is repugnant to the moral
sense of a particular society. In the latter case, the symbol “wrong” is
a descriptive ethical symbol, and the sentence in which it occurs
expresses an ordinary sociological proposition; in the former case, the
symbol “wrong” is a normative ethical symbol, and the sentence in which
it occurs does not, we maintain, express an empirical proposition at
all. It is only with normative ethics that we are at present concerned;
so that whenever ethical symbols are used in the course of this argument
without qualification, they are always to be interpreted as symbols of
the normative type.</p>
<p>In admitting that normative ethical concepts are irreducible to
empirical concepts, we seem to be leaving the way clear for the
“absolutist” view of ethics—that is, the view that statements of value
are not controlled by observation, as ordinary empirical propositions
are, but only by a mysterious “intellectual intuition.” A feature of
this theory, which is seldom recognized by its advocates, is that it
makes statements of value unverifiable. For it is notorious that what
seems intuitively certain to one person may seem doubtful, or even
false, to another. So that unless it is possible to provide some
criterion by which one may decide between conflicting intuitions, a mere
appeal to intuition is worthless as a test of a proposition’s validity.
But in the case of moral judgements, no such criterion can be given.
Some moralists claim to settle the matter by saying that they “know”
that their own moral judgements are correct. But such an assertion is of
purely psychological interest, and has not the slightest tendency to
prove the validity of any moral judgement. For dissentient moralists may
equally well “know” that their ethical views are correct. And, as far as
subjective certainty goes, there will be nothing to choose between them.
When such differences of opinion arise in connection with an ordinary
empirical proposition, one may attempt to resolve them by referring to,
or actually carrying out, some relevant empirical test. But with regard
to ethical statements, there is, on the “absolutist” or “intuitionist”
theory, no relevant empirical test. We are therefore justified in saying
that on this theory ethical statements are held to be unverifiable. They
are, of course, also held to be genuine synthetic propositions.</p>
<p>Considering the use which we have made of the principle that a
synthetic proposition is significant only if it is empirically
verifiable, it is clear that the acceptance of an “absolutist” theory of
ethics would undermine the whole of our main argument. And as we have
already rejected the “naturalistic” theories which are commonly supposed
to provide the only alternative to “absolutism” in ethics, we seem to
have reached a difficult position. We shall meet the difficulty by
showing that the correct treatment of ethical statements is afforded by
a third theory, which is wholly compatible with our radical
empiricism.</p>
<p>We begin by admitting that the fundamental ethical concepts are
unanalysable, inasmuch as there is no criterion by which one can test
the validity of the judgements in which they occur. So far we are in
agreement with the absolutists. But, unlike the absolutists, we are able
to give an explanation of this fact about ethical concepts. We say that
the reason why they are unanalysable is that they are mere
pseudo-concepts. The presence of an ethical symbol in a proposition adds
nothing to its factual content. Thus if I say to someone, “You acted
wrongly in stealing that money,” I am not stating anything more than if
I had simply said, “You stole that money.” In adding that this action is
wrong I am not making any further statement about it. I am simply
evincing my moral disapproval of it. It is as if I had said, “You stole
that money,” in a peculiar tone of horror, or written it with the
addition of some special exclamation marks. The tone, or the exclamation
marks, adds nothing to the literal meaning of the sentence. It merely
serves to show that the expression of it is attended by certain feelings
in the speaker.</p>
<p>If now I generalise my previous statement and say, “Stealing money is
wrong,” I produce a sentence which has no factual meaning—that is,
expresses no proposition which can be either true or false. It is as if
I had written “Stealing money!!”—where the shape and thickness of the
exclamation marks show, by a suitable convention, that a special sort of
moral disapproval is the feeling which is being expressed. It is clear
that there is nothing said here which can be true or false. Another man
may disagree with me about the wrongness of stealing, in the sense that
he may not have the same feelings about stealing as I have, and he may
quarrel with me on account of my moral sentiments. But he cannot,
strictly speaking, contradict me. For in saying that a certain type of
action is right or wrong, I am not making any factual statement, not
even a statement about my own state of mind. I am merely expressing
certain moral sentiments. And the man who is ostensibly contradicting me
is merely expressing his moral sentiments. So that there is plainly no
sense in asking which of us is in the right. For neither of us is
asserting a genuine proposition.</p>
<p>What we have just been saying about the symbol “wrong” applies to all
normative ethical symbols. Sometimes they occur in sentences which
record ordinary empirical facts besides expressing ethical feeling about
those facts: sometimes they occur in sentences which simply express
ethical feeling about a certain type of action, or situation, without
making any statement of fact. But in every case in which one would
commonly be said to be making an ethical judgement, the function of the
relevant ethical word is purely “emotive.” It is used to express feeling
about certain objects, but not to make any assertion about them.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that ethical terms do not serve only to
express feeling. They are calculated also to arouse feeling, and so to
stimulate action. Indeed some of them are used in such a way as to give
the sentences in which they occur the effect of commands. Thus the
sentence “It is your duty to tell the truth” may be regarded both as the
expression of a certain sort of ethical feeling about truthfulness and
as the expression of the command “Tell the truth.” The sentence “You
ought to tell the truth” also involves the command “Tell the truth,” but
here the tone of the command is less emphatic. In the sentence “It is
good to tell the truth” the command has become little more than a
suggestion. And thus the “meaning” of the word “good,” in its ethical
usage, is differentiated from that of the word “duty” or the word
“ought.” In fact we may define the meaning of the various ethical words
in terms both of the different feelings they are ordinarily taken to
express, and also the different responses which they are calculated to
provoke.</p>
<p>We can now see why it is impossible to find a criterion for
determining the validity of ethical judgements. It is not because they
have an “absolute” validity which is mysteriously independent of
ordinary sense-experience, but because they have no objective validity
whatsoever. If a sentence makes no statement at all, there is obviously
no sense in asking whether what it says is true or false. And we have
seen that sentences which simply express moral judgements do not say
anything. They are pure expressions of feeling and as such do not come
under the category of truth and falsehood. They are unverifiable for the
same reason as a cry of pain or a word of command is
unverifiable—because they do not express genuine propositions.</p>
<p>Thus, although our theory of ethics might fairly be said to be
radically subjectivist, it differs in a very important respect from the
orthodox subjectivist theory. For the orthodox subjectivist does not
deny, as we do, that the sentences of a moralizer express genuine
propositions. All he denies is that they express propositions of a
unique non-empirical character. His own view is that they express
propositions about the speaker’s feelings. If this were so, ethical
judgements clearly would be capable of being true or false. They would
be true if the speaker had the relevant feelings, and false if he had
not. And this is a matter which is, in principle, empirically
verifiable. Furthermore they could be significantly contradicted. For if
I say, “Tolerance is a virtue,” and someone answers, “You don’t approve
of it,” he would, on the ordinary subjectivist theory, be contradicting
me. On our theory, he would not be contradicting me, because, in saying
that tolerance was a virtue, I should not be making any statement about
my own feelings or about anything else. I should simply be evincing my
feelings, which is not at all the same thing as saying that I have
them.</p>
<p>The distinction between the expression of feeling and the assertion
of feeling is complicated by the fact that the assertion that one has a
certain feeling often accompanies the expression of that feeling, and is
then, indeed, a factor in the expression of that feeling. Thus I may
simultaneously express boredom and say that I am bored, and in that case
my utterance of the words, “I am bored,” is one of the circumstances
which make it true to say that I am expressing or evincing boredom. But
I can express boredom without actually saying that I am bored. I can
express it by my tone and gestures, while making a statement about
something wholly unconnected with it, or by an ejaculation, or without
uttering any words at all. So that even if the assertion that one has a
certain feeling always involves the expression of that feeling, the
expression of a feeling assuredly does not always involve the assertion
that one has it. And this is the important point to grasp in considering
the distinction between our theory and the ordinary subjectivist theory.
For whereas the subjectivist holds that ethical statements actually
assert the existence of certain feelings, we hold that ethical
statements are expressions and excitants of feeling which do not
necessarily involve any assertions.</p>
<p>We have already remarked that the main objection to the ordinary
subjectivist theory is that the validity of ethical judgements is not
determined by the nature of their author’s feelings. And this is an
objection which our theory escapes. For it does not imply that the
existence of any feelings is a necessary and sufficient condition of the
validity of an ethical judgement. It implies, on the contrary, that
ethical judgements have no validity.</p>
<p>There is, however, a celebrated argument against subjectivist
theories which our theory does not escape. It has been pointed out by
Moore that if ethical statements were simply statements about the
speaker’s feelings, it would be impossible to argue about questions of
value.91 To take a typical example: if a man said that thrift was a
virtue, and another replied that it was a vice, they would not, on this
theory, be disputing with one another. One would be saying that he
approved of thrift, and the other that he didn’t; and there is no reason
why both these statements should not be true. Now Moore held it to be
obvious that we do dispute about questions of value, and accordingly
concluded that the particular form of subjectivism which he was
discussing was false.</p>
<p>It is plain that the conclusion that it is impossible to dispute
about questions of value follows from our theory also. For as we hold
that such sentences as “Thrift is a virtue” and “Thrift is a vice” do
not express propositions at all, we clearly cannot hold that they
express incompatible propositions. We must therefore admit that if
Moore’s argument really refutes the ordinary subjectivist theory, it
also refutes ours. But, in fact, we deny that it does refute even the
ordinary subjectivist theory. For we hold that one really never does
dispute about questions of value.</p>
<p>This may seem, at first sight, to be a very paradoxical assertion.
For we certainly do engage in disputes which are ordinarily regarded as
disputes about questions of value. But, in all such cases, we find, if
we consider the matter closely, that the dispute is not really about a
question of value, but about a question of fact. When someone disagrees
with us about the moral value of a certain action or type of action, we
do admittedly resort to argument in order to win him over to our way of
thinking. But we do not attempt to show by our arguments that he has the
“wrong” ethical feeling towards a situation whose nature he has
correctly apprehended. What we attempt to show is that he is mistaken
about the facts of the case. We argue that he has misconceived the
agent’s motive: or that he has misjudged the effects of the action, or
its probable effects in view of the agent’s knowledge; or that he has
failed to take into account the special circumstances in which the agent
was placed. Or else we employ more general arguments about the effects
which actions of a certain type tend to produce, or the qualities which
are usually manifested in their performance. We do this in the hope that
we have only to get our opponent to agree with us about the nature of
the empirical facts for him to adopt the same moral attitude towards
them as we do. And as the people with whom we argue have generally
received the same moral education as ourselves, and live in the same
social order, our expectation is usually justified. But if our opponent
happens to have undergone a different process of moral “conditioning”
from ourselves, so that, even when he acknowledges all the facts, he
still disagrees with us about the moral value of the actions under
discussion, then we abandon the attempt to convince him by argument. We
say that it is impossible to argue with him because he has a distorted
or undeveloped moral sense; which signifies merely that he employs a
different set of values from our own. We feel that our own system of
values is superior, and therefore speak in such derogatory terms of his.
But we cannot bring forward any arguments to show that our system is
superior. For our judgement that it is so is itself a judgement of
value, and accordingly outside the scope of argument. It is because
argument fails us when we come to deal with pure questions of value, as
distinct from questions of fact, that we finally resort to mere
abuse.</p>
<p>In short, we find that argument is possible on moral questions only
if some system of values is presupposed. If our opponent concurs with us
in expressing moral disapproval of all actions of a given type t, then
we may get him to condemn a particular action A, by bringing forward
arguments to show that A is of type t. For the question whether A does
or does not belong to that type is a plain question of fact. Given that
a man has certain moral principles, we argue that he must, in order to
be consistent, react morally to certain things in a certain way. What we
do not and cannot argue about is the validity of these moral principles.
We merely praise or condemn them in the light of our own feelings.</p>
<p>If anyone doubts the accuracy of this account of moral disputes, let
him try to construct even an imaginary argument on a question of value
which does not reduce itself to an argument about a question of logic or
about an empirical matter of fact. I am confident that he will not
succeed in producing a single example. And if that is the case, he must
allow that its involving the impossibility of purely ethical arguments
is not, as Moore thought, a ground of objection to our theory, but
rather a point in favour of it.</p>
<p>Having upheld our theory against the only criticism which appeared to
threaten it, we may now use it to define the nature of all ethical
enquiries. We find that ethical philosophy consists simply in saying
that ethical concepts are pseudo-concepts and therefore unanalysable.
The further task of describing the different feelings that the different
ethical terms are used to express, and the different reactions that they
customarily provoke, is a task for the psychologist. There cannot be
such a thing as ethical science, if by ethical science one means the
elaboration of a “true” system of morals. For we have seen that, as
ethical judgements are mere expressions of feeling, there can be no way
of determining the validity of any ethical system, and, indeed, no sense
in asking whether any such system is true. All that one may legitimately
enquire in this connection is, What are the moral habits of a given
person or group of people, and what causes them to have precisely those
habits and feelings? And this enquiry falls wholly within the scope of
the existing social sciences.</p>
<p>It appears, then, that ethics, as a branch of knowledge, is nothing
more than a department of psychology and sociology. And in case anyone
thinks that we are overlooking the existence of casuistry, we may remark
that casuistry is not a science, but is a purely analytical
investigation of the structure of a given moral system. In other words,
it is an exercise in formal logic.</p>
<p>When one comes to pursue the psychological enquiries which constitute
ethical science, one is immediately enabled to account for the Kantian
and hedonistic theories of morals. For one finds that one of the chief
causes of moral behaviour is fear, both conscious and unconscious, of a
god’s displeasure, and fear of the enmity of society. And this, indeed,
is the reason why moral precepts present themselves to some people as
“categorical” commands. And one finds, also, that the moral code of a
society is partly determined by the beliefs of that society concerning
the conditions of its own happiness—or, in other words, that a society
tends to encourage or discourage a given type of conduct by the use of
moral sanctions according as it appears to promote or detract from the
contentment of the society as a whole. And this is. the reason why
altruism is recommended in most moral codes and egotism condemned. It is
from the observation of this connection between morality and happiness
that hedonistic or eudaemonistic theories of morals ultimately spring,
just as the moral theory of Kant is based on the fact, previously
explained, that moral precepts have for some people the force of
inexorable commands. As each of these theories ignores the fact which
lies at the root of the other, both may be criticized as being
one-sided; but this is not the main objection to either of them. Their
essential defect is that they treat propositions which refer to the
causes and attributes of our ethical feelings as if they were
definitions of ethical concepts. And thus they fail to recognise that
ethical concepts are pseudo-concepts and consequently indefinable.</p>
<p>As we have already said, our conclusions about the nature of ethics
apply to aesthetics also. Æsthetic terms are used in exactly the same
way as ethical terms. Such aesthetic words as “beautiful” and “hideous”
are employed, as ethical words are employed, not to make statements of
fact, but simply to express certain feelings and evoke a certain
response. It follows, as in ethics, that there is no sense in
attributing objective validity to aesthetic judgements, and no
possibility of arguing about questions of value in aesthetics, but only
about questions of fact. A scientific treatment of aesthetics would show
us what in general were the causes of aesthetic feeling, why various
societies produced and admired the works of art they did, why taste
varies as it does within a given society, and so forth. And these are
ordinary psychological or sociological questions. They have, of course,
little or nothing to do with æsthetic criticism as we understand it. But
that is because the purpose of æsthetic criticism is not so much to give
knowledge as to communicate emotion. The critic, by calling attention to
certain features of the work under review, and expressing his own
feelings about them, endeavours to make us share his attitude towards
the work as a whole. The only relevant propositions that he formulates
are propositions describing the nature of the work. And these are plain
records of fact. We conclude, therefore, that there is nothing in
aesthetics, any more than there is in ethics, to justify the view that
it embodies a unique type of knowledge.</p>
<p>It should now be clear that the only information which we can
legitimately derive from the study of our aesthetic and moral
experiences is information about our own mental and physical make-up. We
take note of these experiences as providing data for our psychological
and sociological generalisations. And this is the only way in which they
serve to increase our knowledge. It follows that any attempt to make our
use of ethical and æsthetic concepts the basis of a metaphysical theory
concerning the existence of a world of values, as distinct from the
world of facts, involves a false analysis of these concepts. Our own
analysis has shown that the phenomena of moral experience cannot fairly
be used to support any rationalist or metaphysical doctrine whatsoever.
In particular, they cannot, as Kant hoped, be used to establish the
existence of a transcendent god.</p>
<p>This mention of God brings us to the question of the possibility of
religious knowledge. We shall see that this possibility has already been
ruled out by our treatment of metaphysics. But, as this is a point of
considerable interest, we may be permitted to discuss it at some
length.</p>
<p>It is now generally admitted, at any rate by philosophers, that the
existence of a being having the attributes which define the god of any
non-animistic religion cannot be demonstratively proved. To see that
this is so, we have only to ask ourselves what are the premises from
which the existence of such a god could be deduced. If the conclusion
that a god exists is to be demonstratively certain, then these premises
must be certain; for, as the conclusion of a deductive argument is
already contained in the premises, any uncertainty there may be about
the truth of the premises is necessarily shared by it. But we know that
no empirical proposition can ever be anything more than probable. It is
only a priori propositions that are logically certain. But we cannot
deduce the existence of a god from an a priori proposition. For we know
that the reason why a priori propositions are certain is that they are
tautologies. And from a set of tautologies nothing but a further
tautology can be validly deduced. It follows that there is no
possibility of demonstrating the existence of a god.</p>
<p>What is not so generally recognised is that there can be no way of
proving that the existence of a god, such as the God of Christianity, is
even probable. Yet this also is easily shown. For if the existence of
such a god were probable, then the proposition that he existed would be
an empirical hypothesis. And in that case it would be possible to deduce
from it, and other empirical hypotheses, certain experiential
propositions which were not deducible from those other hypotheses alone.
But in fact this is not possible. It is sometimes claimed, indeed, that
the existence of a certain sort of regularity in nature constitutes
sufficient evidence for the existence of a god. But if the sentence “God
exists” entails no more than that certain types of phenomena occur in
certain sequences, then to assert the existence of a god will be simply
equivalent to asserting that there is the requisite regularity in
nature; and no religious man would admit that this was all he intended
to assert in asserting the existence of a god. He would say that in
talking about God, he was talking about a transcendent being who might
be known through certain empirical manifestations, but certainly could
not be defined in terms of those manifestations. But in that case the
term “god” is a metaphysical term. And if “god” is a metaphysical term,
then it cannot be even probable that a god exists. For to say that “God
exists” is to make a metaphysical utterance which cannot be either true
or false. And by the same criterion, no sentence which purports to
describe the nature of a transcendent god can possess any literal
significance.</p>
<p>It is important not to confuse this view of religious assertions with
the view that is adopted by atheists, or agnostics.92 For it is
characteristic of an agnostic to hold that the existence of a god is a
possibility in which there is no good reason either to believe or
disbelieve; and it is characteristic of an atheist to hold that it is at
least probable that no god exists. And our view that all utterances
about the nature of God are nonsensical, so far from being identical
with, or even lending any support to, either of these familiar
contentions, is actually incompatible with them. For if the assertion
that there is a god is nonsensical, then the atheist’s assertion that
there is no god is equally nonsensical, since it is only a significant
proposition that can be significantly contradicted. As for the agnostic,
although he refrains from saying either that there is or that there is
not a god, he does not deny that the question whether a transcendent god
exists is a genuine question. He does not deny that the two sentences
“There is a transcendent god” and “There is no transcendent god” express
propositions one of which is actually true and the other false. All he
says is that we have no means of telling which of them is true, and
therefore ought not to commit ourselves to either. But we have seen that
the sentences in question do not express propositions at all. And this
means that agnosticism also is ruled out.</p>
<p>Thus we offer the theist the same comfort as we gave to the moralist.
His assertions cannot possibly be valid, but they cannot be invalid
either. As he says nothing at all about the world, he cannot justly be
accused of saying anything false, or anything for which he has
insufficient grounds. It is only when the theist claims that in
asserting the existence of a transcendent god he is expressing a genuine
proposition that we are entitled to disagree with him.</p>
<p>It is to be remarked that in cases where deities are identified with
natural objects, assertions concerning them may be allowed to be
significant. If, for example, a man tells me that the occurrence of
thunder is alone both necessary and sufficient to establish the truth of
the proposition that Jehovah is angry, I may conclude that, in his usage
of words, the sentence “Jehovah is angry” is equivalent to “It is
thundering.” But in sophisticated religions, though they may be to some
extent based on men’s awe of natural process which they cannot
sufficiently understand, the “person” who is supposed to control the
empirical world is not himself located in it; he is held to be superior
to the empirical world, and so outside it; and he is endowed with
super-empirical attributes. But the notion of a person whose essential
attributes are non-empirical is not an intelligible notion at all. We
may have a word which is used as if it named this “person,” but, unless
the sentences in which it occurs express propositions which are
empirically verifiable, it cannot be said to symbolize anything. And
this is the case with regard to the word “god,” in the usage in which it
is intended to refer to a transcendent object. The mere existence of the
noun is enough to foster the illusion that there is a real, or at any
rate a possible entity corresponding to it. It is only when we enquire
what God’s attributes are that we discover that “God,” in this usage, is
not a genuine name.</p>
<p>It is common to find belief in a transcendent god conjoined with
belief in an after-life. But, in the form which it usually takes, the
content of this belief is not a genuine hypothesis. To say that men do
not ever die, or that the state of death is merely a state of prolonged
insensibility, is indeed to express a significant proposition, though
all the available evidence goes to show that it is false. But to say
that there is something imperceptible inside a man, which is his soul or
his real self, and that it goes on living after he is dead, is to make a
metaphysical assertion which has no more factual content than the
assertion that there is a transcendent god.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that, according to the account which we have
given of religious assertions, there is no logical ground for antagonism
between religion and natural science. As far as the question of truth or
falsehood is concerned, there is no opposition between the natural
scientist and the theist who believes in a transcendent god. For since
the religious utterances of the theist are not genuine propositions at
all, they cannot stand in any logical relation to the propositions of
science. Such antagonism as there is between religion and science
appears to consist in the fact that science takes away one of the
motives which make men religious. For it is acknowledged that one of the
ultimate sources of religious feeling lies in the inability of men to
determine their own destiny; and science tends to destroy the feeling of
awe with which men regard an alien world, by making them believe that
they can understand and anticipate the course of natural phenomena, and
even to some extent control it. The fact that it has recently become
fashionable for physicists themselves to be sympathetic towards religion
is a point in favour of this hypothesis. For this sympathy towards
religion marks the physicists’ own lack of confidence in the validity of
their hypotheses, which is a reaction on their part from the
anti-religious dogmatism of nineteenth-century scientists, and a natural
outcome of the crisis through which physics has just passed.</p>
<p>It is not within the scope of this enquiry to enter more deeply into
the causes of religious feeling, or to discuss the probability of the
continuance of religious belief. We are concerned only to answer those
questions which arise out of our discussion of the possibility of
religious knowledge. The point which we wish to establish is that there
cannot be any transcendent truths of religion. For the sentences which
the theist uses to express such “truths” are not literally
significant.</p>
<p>An interesting feature of this conclusion is that it accords with
what many theists are accustomed to say themselves. For we are often
told that the nature of God is a mystery which transcends the human
understanding. But to say that something transcends the human
understanding is to say that it is unintelligible. And what is
unintelligible cannot significantly be described. Again, we are told
that God is not an object of reason but an object of faith. This may be
nothing more than an admission that the existence of God must be taken
on trust, since it cannot be proved. But it may also be an assertion
that God is the object of a purely mystical intuition, and cannot
therefore be defined in terms which are intelligible to the reason. And
I think there are many theists who would assert this. But if one allows
that it is impossible to define God in intelligible terms, then one is
allowing that it is impossible for a sentence both to be significant and
to be about God. If a mystic admits that the object of his vision is
something which cannot be described, then he must also admit that he is
bound to talk nonsense when he describes it.</p>
<p>For his part, the mystic may protest that his intuition does reveal
truths to him, even though he cannot explain to others what these truths
are; and that we who do not possess this faculty of intuition can have
no ground for denying that it is a cognitive faculty. For we can hardly
maintain a priori that there are no ways of discovering true
propositions except those which we ourselves employ. The answer is that
we set no limit to the number of ways in which one may come to formulate
a true proposition. We do not in any way deny that a synthetic truth may
be discovered by purely intuitive methods as well as by the rational
method of induction. But we do say that every synthetic proposition,
however it may have been arrived at, must be subject to the test of
actual experience. We do not deny a priori that the mystic is able to
discover truths by his own special methods. We wait to hear what are the
propositions which embody his discoveries, in order to see whether they
are verified or confuted by our empirical observations. But the mystic,
so far from producing propositions which are empirically verified, is
unable to produce any intelligible propositions at all. And therefore we
say that his intuition has not revealed to him any facts. It is no use
his saying that he has apprehended facts but is unable to express them.
For we know that if he really had acquired any information, he would be
able to express it. He would be able to indicate in some way or other
how the genuineness of his discovery might be empirically determined.
The fact that he cannot reveal what he “knows,” or even himself devise
an empirical test to validate his “knowledge,” shows that his state of
mystical intuition is not a genuinely cognitive state. So that in
describing his vision the mystic does not give us any information about
the external world; he merely gives us indirect information about the
condition of his own mind.</p>
<p>These considerations dispose of the argument from religious
experience, which many philosophers still regard as a valid argument in
favour of the existence of a god. They say that it is logically possible
for men to be immediately acquainted with God, as they are immediately
acquainted with a sense-content, and that there is no reason why one
should be prepared to believe a man when he says that he is seeing a
yellow patch, and refuse to believe him when he says that he is seeing
God. The answer to this is that if the man who asserts that he is seeing
God is merely asserting that he is experiencing a peculiar kind of
sense-content, then we do not for a moment deny that his assertion may
be true. But, ordinarily, the man who says that he is seeing God is
saying not merely that he is experiencing a religious emotion, but also
that there exists a transcendent being who is the object of this
emotion; just as the man who says that he sees a yellow patch is
ordinarily saying not merely that his visual sense-field contains a
yellow sense-content, but also that there exists a yellow object to
which the sense-content belongs. And it is not irrational to be prepared
to believe a man when he asserts the existence of a yellow object, and
to refuse to believe him when he asserts the existence of a transcendent
god. For whereas the sentence “There exists here a yellow-coloured
material thing” expresses a genuine synthetic proposition which could be
empirically verified, the sentence “There exists a transcendent god”
has, as we have seen, no literal significance.</p>
<p>We conclude, therefore, that the argument from religious experience
is altogether fallacious. The fact that people have religious
experiences is interesting from the psychological point of view, but it
does not in any way imply that there is such a thing as religious
knowledge, any more than our having moral experiences implies that there
is such a thing as moral knowledge. The theist, like the moralist, may
believe that his experiences are cognitive experiences, but, unless he
can formulate his “knowledge” in propositions that are empirically
verifiable, we may be sure that he is deceiving himself. It follows that
those philosophers who fill their books with assertions that they
intuitively “know” this or that moral or religious “truth” are merely
providing material for the psycho-analyst. For no act of intuition can
be said to reveal a truth about any matter of fact unless it issues in
verifiable propositions. And all such propositions are to be
incorporated in the system of empirical propositions which constitutes
science.</p>
