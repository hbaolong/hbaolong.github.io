THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS</h4>
<p>FROM OUR ASSERTION that philosophy provides definitions, it must not
be inferred that it is the function of the philosopher to compile a
dictionary, in the ordinary sense. For the definitions which philosophy
is required to provide are of a different kind from those which we
expect to find in dictionaries. In a dictionary we look mainly for what
may be called explicit definitions; in philosophy, for definitions in
use. A brief explanation should suffice to make the nature of this
distinction clear.</p>
<p>We define a symbol explicitly when we put forward another symbol, or
symbolic expression which is synonymous with it. And the word
“synonymous” is here used in such a way that two symbols belonging to
the same language can be said to be synonymous if, and only if, the
simple substitution of one symbol for the other, in any sentence in
which either can significantly occur, always yields a new sentence which
is equivalent to the old. And we say that two sentences of the same
language are equivalent if, and only if, every sentence which is
entailed by any given group of sentences in conjunction with one of them
is entailed by the same group in conjunction with the other. And, in
this usage of the word “entail,” a sentence s is said to entail a
sentence t when the proposition expressed by t is deducible from the
proposition expressed by s; while a proposition p is said to be
deducible from, or to follow from, a proposition q when the denial of p
contradicts the assertion of q.</p>
<p>The provision of these criteria enables us to see that the vast
majority of the definitions which are given in ordinary discourse are
explicit, definitions. In particular, it is worth remarking that the
process of defining per genus et differentiam, to which Aristotelian
logicians devote so much attention, always yields definitions which are
explicit in the foregoing sense. Thus, when we define an oculist as an
eye-doctor, what we are asserting is that, in the English language, the
two symbols “oculist” and “eye-doctor” are synonymous. And, generally
speaking, all the questions that are discussed by logicians in
connection with this mode of definition are concerned with the possible
ways of finding synonyms in a given language for any given term. We
shall not enter into these questions ourselves, because they are
irrelevant to our present purpose, which is to expound the method of
philosophy. For the philosopher, as we have already said, is primarily
concerned with the provision, not of explicit definitions, but of
definitions in use.52</p>
<p>We define-a symbol in use, not by saying that it is synonymous with
some other symbol, but by showing how the sentences in which it
significantly occurs can be translated into equivalent sentences, which
contain neither the definiendum itself, nor any of its synonyms. A good
illustration of this process is provided by Bertrand Russell’s so-called
theory of definite descriptions, which is not a theory at all in the
ordinary sense, but an indication of, the way in which all phrases of
the form “the so-and-so” are to be defined.53 It proclaims that every
sentence which contains a symbolic expression of this form can be
translated into a sentence which does not contain any such expression,
but does contain a sub-sentence asserting that one, and only one, object
possesses a certain property, or else that no one object possesses a
certain property. Thus, the sentence “The round square cannot exist” is
equivalent to “No one thing can be both square and round”; and the
sentence “The author of Waverley was Scotch” is equivalent to “One
person, and one person only, wrote Waverley, and that person was
Scotch.”54 The first of these examples provides us with a typical
illustration of the way in which any definite descriptive phrase which
occurs as the subject of a negative existential sentence can be
eliminated; and the second, with a typical illustration of the way in
which any definite descriptive phrase which occurs anywhere in any other
type of sentence can be eliminated. Together, therefore, they show us
how to express what is expressed by any sentence which contains a
definite descriptive phrase without employing any such phrase. And thus
they furnish us with a definition of these phrases in use.</p>
<p>The effect of this definition of descriptive phrases, as of all good
definitions, is to increase our understanding of certain sentences. And
this is a benefit which the author of such a definition confers not only
on others, but also on himself. It might be objected that he must
already understand the sentences in order to be able to define the
symbols which occur in them. But this initial understanding need not
amount to anything more than an ability to tell, in practice, what sort
of situations verify the propositions they express. Such an
understanding of sentences containing definite descriptive phrases may
be possessed even by those who believe that there are subsistent
entities, such as the round square, or the present King of France. But
the fact that they do maintain this shows that their understanding of
these sentences is imperfect. For their lapse into metaphysics is the
outcome of the naive assumption that definite descriptive phrases are
demonstrative symbols. And in the light of the clearer understanding
which is afforded by Russell’s definition, we see that this assumption
is false. Nor could this end have been achieved by an explicit
definition of any descriptive phrase. What was required was a
translation of sentences containing such phrases which would reveal what
may be called their logical complexity. In general, we may say that it
is the purpose of a philosophical definition to dispel those confusions
which arise from our imperfect understanding of certain types of
sentence in our language, where the need cannot be met by the provision
of a synonym for any symbol, either because there is no synonym, or else
because the available synonyms are unclear in the same fashion as the
symbol to which the confusion is due.</p>
<p>A complete philosophical elucidation of any language would consist,
first, in enumerating the types of sentence that were significant in
that language, and then in displaying the relations of equivalence that
held between sentences of various types. And here it may be explained
that two sentences are said to be of the same type when they can be
correlated in such a way that to each symbol in one sentence there
corresponds a symbol of the same type in the other; and that two symbols
are said to be of the same type when it is always possible to substitute
one for the other without changing a significant sentence into a piece
of nonsense. Such a system of definitions in use would reveal what may
be called the structure of the language in question. And thus we may
regard any particular philosophical “theory,” such as Russell’s “theory
of definite descriptions,” as a revelation of part of the structure of a
given language. In Russell’s case, the language is the everyday English
language; and any other language, such as French or German, which has
the same structure as English.55 And, in this context, it is not
necessary to draw a distinction between the spoken and the written
language. As far as the validity of a philosophical definition is
concerned, it does not matter whether we regard the symbol defined as
being constituted by visible marks or by sounds.</p>
<p>A factor which complicates the structure of a language such as
English is the prevalence of ambiguous symbols. A symbol is said to be
ambiguous when it is constituted by signs which are identical in their
sensible form, not only with one another, but also with signs which are
elements of some other symbol. For what makes two signs elements of the
same symbol is not merely an identity of form, but also an identity of
usage. Thus, if we were guided merely by the form of the sign, we should
assume that the “is” which occurs in the sentence “He is the author of
that book” was the same symbol as the “is” which occurs in the sentence
“A cat is a mammal.” But, when we come to translate the sentences, we
find that the first is equivalent to “He, and no one else, wrote that
book,” and the second to “The class of mammals contains the class of
cats.” And this shows that, in this instance, each “is” is an ambiguous
symbol which must not be confused with the other, nor with the ambiguous
symbols of existence, and class-membership, and identity, and
entailment, which are also constituted by signs of the form “is.”</p>
<p>To say that a symbol is constituted by signs which are identical with
one another in their sensible form, and in their significance, and that
a sign is a sense-content, or a series of sense-contents, which is used
to convey literal meaning, is not to say that a symbol is a collection,
or system, of sense-contents. For when we speak of certain objects, b,
c, d . . . as being elements of an object e, and of e as being
constituted by b, c, d . . . we are not saying that they form part of e,
in the sense in which my arm is a part of my body, or a particular set
of books on my shelf is part of my collection of books. What we are
saying is that all the sentences in which the symbol e occurs can be
translated into sentences which do not contain e itself, or any symbol
which is synonymous with e, but do contain symbols b, c, d . . . In such
a case we say that e is a logical construction out of b, c, d . . . And,
in general, we may explain the nature of logical constructions by saying
that the introduction of symbols which denote logical constructions is a
device which enables us to state complicated propositions about the
elements of these constructions in a relatively simple form.</p>
<p>What one must not say is that logical constructions are fictitious
objects. For while it is true that the English State, for example, is a
logical construction out of individual people, and that the table at
which I am writing is a logical construction out of sense-contents, it
is not true that either the English State or this table is fictitious,
in the sense in which Hamlet or a mirage is fictitious. Indeed, the
assertion that tables are logical constructions out of sense-contents is
not a factual assertion at all, in the sense in which the assertion that
tables were fictitious objects would be a factual assertion, albeit a
false one. It is, as our explanation of 63 the notion of a logical
construction should have made clear, a linguistic assertion, to the
effect that the symbol “table” is definable in terms of certain symbols
which stand for sense-contents. not explicitly, but in use. And this, as
we have seen, is tantamount to saying that sentences which contain the
symbol “table,” or the corresponding symbol in any language which has
the same structure as English, can all be translated into sentences of
the same language which do not contain that symbol, nor any of its
synonyms, but do contain certain symbols which stand for sense-contents;
a fact which may be loosely expressed by saying that to say anything
about a table is always to say something about sense-contents. This does
not, of course, imply that to say something about a table is ever to say
the same thing about the relevant sense-contents. For example, the
sentence, “I am now sitting in front of a table” can, in principle, be
translated into a sentence which does not mention tables, but only
sense-contents. But this does not mean that we can simply substitute a
sense-content symbol for the symbol “table” in the original sentence. If
we do this, our new sentence, so far from being equivalent to the old,
will be a mere piece of nonsense. To obtain a sentence which is
equivalent to the sentence about the table, but refers to sense-contents
instead, the whole of the original sentence has to be altered. And this,
indeed, is implied by the fact that to say that tables are logical
constructions out of sense-contents is to say, not that the symbol
“table” can be explicitly defined in terms of symbols which stand for
sense-contents, but only that it can be so defined in use. For, as we
have seen, the function of a definition in use is not to provide us with
a synonym for any symbol, but to enable us to translate sentences of a
certain type.</p>
<p>The problem of giving an actual rule for translating sentences about
a material thing into sentences about sense-contents, which may be
called the problem of the “reduction” of material things to
sense-contents, is the main philosophical part of the traditional
problem of perception. It is true that writers on perception who set out
to describe “the nature of a material thing” believe themselves to be
discussing a factual question. But, as we have already pointed out, this
is a mistake. The question, “What is the nature of a material thing?”
is, like any other question of that form, a linguistic question, being a
demand for a definition. And the propositions which are set forth in
answer to it are linguistic 64 propositions, even though they may be
expressed in such a way that they seem to be factual. They are
propositions about the relationship of symbols, and not about the
properties of the things which the symbols denote. ,</p>
<p>It is necessary to emphasise this point in connection with the
“problem of perception,” since the fact that we are unable, in our
everyday language, to describe the properties of sense-contents with any
great precision, for lack of the requisite symbols, makes it convenient
to give the solution of this problem in factual terminology. We express
the fact that to speak about material things is, for each of us, a way
of speaking about sense-contents, by saying that each of us “constructs”
material things out of sense-contents: and we reveal the relationship
between the two sorts of symbols by showing what are the principles of
this “construction.” In other words, one answers the question, “What is
the nature of a material thing?” by indicating, in general terms, what
are the relations that must hold between any two of one’s sense-contents
for them to be elements of the same material thing. The difficulty,
which here seems to arise, of reconciling the subjectivity of
sense-contents with the objectivity of material things will be dealt
with in a later chapter of this book.56</p>
<p>The solution which we shall now give of this “problem of perception”
will serve as a further illustration of the method of philosophical
analysis. To simplify the question, we introduce the following
definitions. We say that two sense-contents directly resemble one
another when there is either no difference, or only an infinitesimal
difference, of quality between them; and that they resemble one another
indirectly when they are linked by a series of direct resemblances, but
are not themselves directly resemblant, a relationship whose possibility
depends on the fact that the relative product57 of infinitesimal
differences in quality is an appreciable difference in quality. And we
say that two visual, or tactual, sense-contents are directly continuous
when they belong to successive members of a series of actual, or
possible, sense-fields, and there is no difference, or only an
infinitesimal difference, between them, with respect to the position of
each in its own sense-field; and that they are indirectly continuous
when they are related by an actual, or possible, series of such direct
continuities. And here it should be explained that to say of a
sense-experience, or a sense-field which is a part of a
sense-experience, or a sense-content which is a part of a sense-field,
that it is possible, as opposed to actual, is to say, not that it ever
has occurred or will occur in fact, but that it would occur if certain
specifiable conditions were fulfilled. So when it is said that a
material thing is constituted by both actual and possible
sense-contents, all that is being asserted is that the sentences
referring to sense-contents, which are the translations of the sentences
referring to any material thing, are both categorical and hypothetical.
And thus the notion of a possible sense-content, or sense-experience, is
as unobjectionable as the familiar notion of a hypothetical
statement.</p>
<p>Relying on these preliminary definitions, one may assert with regard
to any two of one’s visual sense-contents, or with regard to any two of
one’s tactual sense-contents, that they are elements of the same
material thing if, and only if, they are related to one another by a
relation of direct, or indirect, resemblance in certain respects, and by
a relation of direct, or indirect, continuity. And as each of these
relations is symmetrical—that is to say, a relation which cannot hold
between any terms A and B without also holding between B and A—and also
transitive—that is, a relation which cannot hold between a term A and
another term B, and between B and another term C, without holding
between A and C—it follows that the groups of visual and tactual
sense-contents which are constituted by means of these relations cannot
have any members in common. And this means that no visual, or tactual,
sense-content can be an element of more than one material thing.</p>
<p>The next step in the analysis of the notion of a material thing is to
show how these separate groups of visual and tactual sense-contents are
correlated. And this may be effected by saying that any two of one’s
visual and tactual groups belong to the same material thing when every
element of the visual group which is of minimal visual depth forms part
of the same sense-experience as an element of the tactual group which is
of minimal tactual depth. We cannot here define visual or tactual depth
otherwise than ostensively. The depth of a visual or tactual
sense-content is as much a sensible property of it as its length or
breadth.58 But we may describe it by saying that one visual or tactual
sense-content has a greater depth than another when it is farther from
the observer’s body, provided that we make it clear that this is not
intended to be a definition. For it would clearly vitiate any
“reduction” of material things to sense-contents if the defining
sentences contained references to human bodies, which are themselves
material things. We, however, are obliged to mention material things
when we wish to describe certain sense-contents, because the poverty of
our language is such that we have no other verbal means of explaining
what their properties are.</p>
<p>As for the sense-contents of taste, or sound, or smell, which are
assigned to particular material things, they may be classified by
reference to their association with tactual sense-contents. Thus, we
assign sense-contents of taste to the same material things as the
simultaneously occurring sense-contents of touch which are experienced
by the palate, or the tongue. And in assigning an auditory or olfactory
sense-content to a material thing, we remark that it is a member of a
possible series of temporarily continuous sounds, or smells, of uniform
quality but gradually increasing intensity; the series, namely, which
one would ordinarily be said to experience in the course of moving
towards the place from which the sound, or the smell, came; and we
assign it to the same material thing as the tactual sense-content which
is experienced at the same time as the sound, or the smell, of maximum
intensity in the series.</p>
<p>What is next required of us, who are attempting to analyse the notion
of a material thing, is the provision of a rule for translating
sentences which refer to the “real” qualities of material things. Our
answer is that to say of a certain quality that it is the real quality
of a given material thing is to say that it characterises those elements
of the thing which are the most conveniently measured of all the
elements which possess qualities of the kind in question. Thus, when I
look at a coin and assert that it is really round in shape, I am not
asserting that the shape of the sense-content, which is the element of
the coin that I am actually observing, is round, still less that the
shape of all the visual, or tactual, elements of the coin is round; what
I am asserting is that roundness of shape characterises those elements
of the coin which are experienced from the point of view from which
measurements of shape are most conveniently carried out. And similarly I
assert that the real colour of the paper on which I am writing is white,
even though it may not always appear to be white, because whiteness of
colour characterises those visual elements of the paper which are
experienced in the conditions in which the greatest discrimination of
colours is possible. And, finally, we define relations of quality, or
position, between material things in terms of the relations of quality,
or position, which obtain between such “privileged” elements.</p>
<p>This definition, or, rather, this outline of a definition, of symbols
which stand for material things is intended to have the same sort of
effect as the definition of descriptive phrases which we gave as our
original example of the process of philosophical analysis. It serves to
increase our understanding of the sentences in which we refer to
material things. In this case also, there is, of course, a sense in
which we already understand such sentences. Those who use the English
language have no difficulty, in practice, in identifying the situations
which determine the truth or falsehood of such simple statements as
“This is a table,” or “Pennies are round.” But they may very well be
unaware of the hidden logical complexity of such statements which our
analysis of the notion of a material thing has just brought to light.
And, as a result, they may be led to adopt some metaphysical belief,
such as the belief in the existence of material substances or invisible
substrata, which is a source of confusion in all their speculative
thought. And the utility of the philosophical definition which dispels
such confusions is not to be measured by the apparent triviality of the
sentences which it translates.</p>
<p>It is sometimes said that the purpose of such philosophical
definitions is to reveal the meaning of certain symbols, or combinations
of symbols. The objection to this way of speaking is that it does not
give an unequivocal description of the philosopher’s practice, because
it employs, in “meaning,” a highly ambiguous symbol. It is for this
reason that we defined the relation of equivalence between sentences,
without referring to “meaning.” And, indeed, I doubt whether all the
sentences which are equivalent, according to our definition, would
ordinarily be said to have the same meaning. For I think that although a
complex sign of the form “the sentences s and t have the same meaning”
is sometimes used, or taken, to express what we express by saying “the
sentences s and t are equivalent,” this is not the way in which such a
sign is most commonly used or interpreted. I think that if we are to use
the sign “meaning” in the way in which it is most commonly used, we must
not say that two sentences have the same meaning for anyone, unless the
occurrence of one always has the same effect on his thoughts and actions
as the occurrence of the other. And, clearly, it is possible for two
sentences to be equivalent, by our criterion, without having the same
effect on anyone who employs the language. For instance, “p is a law of
nature” is equivalent to “p is a general hypothesis which can always be
relied on”: but the associations of the symbol “law” are such that the
former sentence tends to produce a very different psychological effect
from its equivalent. It gives rise to a belief in the orderliness of
nature, and even in the existence of a power. “behind” that orderliness,
which is not evoked by the equivalent sentence, and has, indeed, no
rational warrant. Thus there are many people for whom these sentences
do, in this common sense of “meaning,” have different meanings. And
this, I suspect, accounts for the widespread reluctance to admit that
the laws of nature are merely hypotheses, just as the failure of some
philosophers to recognise that material things are reducible to
sense-contents is very largely due to the fact that no sentence which
refers to sense-contents ever has the same psychological effect on them
as a sentence which refers to a material thing. But, as we have seen,
this is not a valid ground for denying that any two such sentences are
equivalent.</p>
<p>Accordingly, one should avoid saying that philosophy is concerned
with the meaning of symbols, because the ambiguity of “meaning” leads
the undiscerning critic to judge the result of a philosophical enquiry
by a criterion which is not applicable to it, but only to an empirical
enquiry concerning the psychological effect which the occurrence of
certain symbols has on a certain group of people. Such empirical
enquiries are, indeed, an important element in sociology and in the
scientific study of a language; but they are quite distinct from the
logical enquiries which constitute philosophy.</p>
<p>It is misleading, also, to say, as some do, that philosophy tells us
how certain symbols are actually used. For this suggests that the
propositions of philosophy are factual propositions concerning the
behaviour of a certain group of people; and this is not the case. The
philosopher who asserts that, in the English language, the sentence “The
author of Waverley was Scotch” is equivalent to “One person, and one
person only, wrote Waverley, and that person was Scotch” is not
asserting that all, or most, English-speaking people use these sentences
interchangeably. What he is asserting is that, in virtue of certain
rules of entailment, namely those which are characteristic of “correct”
English, every sentence which is entailed by “The author of Waverley was
Scotch,” in conjunction with any given group of sentences, is entailed
also by that group, in conjunction with “One person, and one person
only, wrote Waverley, and that person was Scotch.” That English-speaking
people should employ the verbal conventions that they do is, indeed, an
empirical fact. But the deduction of relations of equivalence from the
rules of entailment which characterise the English, or any other,
language is a purely logical activity; and it is in this logical
activity, and not in any empirical study of the linguistic habits of any
group of people, that philosophical analysis consists.59</p>
<p>Thus, in specifying the language to which he intends his definitions
to apply, the philosopher is simply describing the conventions from
which his definitions are deduced; and the validity of the definitions
depends solely on their compatibility with these conventions. In most
cases, indeed, the definitions are obtained from conventions which do,
in fact, correspond to the conventions which are actually observed by
some group of people. And it is a necessary condition of the utility of
the definitions, as a means of clarification, that this should be so.
But it is a mistake to suppose that the existence of such a
correspondence is ever part of what the definitions actually
assert.60</p>
<p>It is to be remarked that the process of analysing a language is
facilitated if it is possible to use for the classification of its forms
an artificial system of symbols whose structure is known. The best-known
example of such a symbolism is the so-called system of logistic which
was employed by Russell and Whitehead in their Principia Mathematica.
But it is not necessary that the language in which analysis is carried
out should be different from the language analysed. If it were, we
should be obliged to suppose, as Russell once suggested, “that every
language has a structure concerning which, in the language, nothing can
be said, but that there may be another language dealing with the
structure of the first language, and having itself a new structure, and
that to this hierarchy of languages there may be no limit.”61 This was
written presumably in the belief that an attempt to refer to the
structure of a language in the language itself would lead to the
occurrence of logical paradoxes.62 But Carnap, by actually carrying out
such an analysis, has subsequently shown that a language can without
self-contradiction be used in the analysis of itself.63</p>
