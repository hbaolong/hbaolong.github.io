<h4 id="chapter-v-truth-and-probability">CHAPTER V TRUTH AND
PROBABILITY</h4>
<p>HAVING SHOWN how the validity of a priori propositions is determined,
we shall now put forward the criterion which is used to determine the
validity of empirical propositions. In this way we shall complete our
theory of truth. For it is easy to see that the purpose of a “theory of
truth” is simply to describe the criteria by which the validity of the
various kinds of propositions is determined. And as all propositions are
either empirical or a priori, and we have already dealt with the a
priori, all that is now required to complete our theory of truth is an
indication of the way in which we determine the validity of empirical
propositions. And this we shall shortly proceed to give.</p>
<p>But first of all we ought, perhaps, to justify our assumption that
the object of a “theory of truth” can only be to show how propositions
are validated. For it is commonly supposed that the business of the
philosopher who concerns himself with “truth” is to answer the question
“What is truth?” and that it is only an answer to this question that can
fairly be said to constitute a “theory of truth.” But when we come to
consider what this famous question actually entails, we find that it is
not a question which gives rise to any genuine problem; and consequently
that no theory can be required to deal with it.</p>
<p>We have already remarked that all questions of the form, “What is the
nature of x?” are requests for a definition of a symbol in use, and that
to ask for a definition of a symbol x in use is to ask how the sentences
in which x occurs are to be translated into equivalent sentences, which
do not contain x or any of its synonyms. Applying this to the case of
“truth” we find that to ask, “What is truth?” is to ask for such a
translation of the sentence “(the proposition) p is true.”</p>
<p>It may be objected here that we are ignoring the fact that it is not
merely propositions that can be said to be true or false, but also
statements and assertions and judgements and assumptions and opinions
and beliefs. But the answer to this is that to say that a belief, or a
statement, or a judgement, is true is always an elliptical way of
ascribing truth to a proposition, which is believed, or stated, or
judged. Thus, if I say that the Marxist’s belief that capitalism leads
to war is true, what I am saying is that the proposition, believed by
Marxists, that capitalism leads to war is true; and the illustration
holds good when the word “opinion” or “assumption,” or any of the others
in the list, is substituted for the word “belief.” And, further, it must
be made clear that we are not hereby committing ourselves to the
metaphysical doctrine that propositions are real entities.77 Regarding
classes as a species of logical constructions, we may define a
proposition as a class of sentences which have the same intensional
significance for anyone who understands them. Thus, the sentences, “I am
ill,” “Ich bin krank,” “Je suis malade,” are all elements of the
proposition “I am ill.” And what we have previously said about logical
constructions should make it clear that we are not asserting that a
proposition is a collection of sentences, but rather that to speak about
a given proposition is a way of speaking about certain sentences, just
as to speak about sentences, in this usage, is a way of speaking about
particular signs.</p>
<p>Reverting to the analysis of truth, we find that in all sentences of
the form “p is true,” the phrase “is true” is logically superfluous.
When, for example, one says that the proposition “Queen Anne is dead” is
true, all that one is saying is that Queen Anne is dead. And similarly,
when one says that the proposition “Oxford is the capital of England” is
false, all that one is saying is that Oxford is not the capital of
England. Thus, to say that a proposition is true is just to assert it,
and to say that it is false is just to assert its contradictory. And
this indicates that the terms “true” and “false” connote nothing, but
function in the sentence simply as marks of assertion and denial. And in
that case there can be no sense in asking us to analyse the concept of
“truth.”</p>
<p>This point seems almost too obvious to mention, yet the preoccupation
of philosophers with the “problem of truth” shows that they have
overlooked it. Their excuse is that references to truth generally occur
in sentences whose grammatical forms suggest that the word “true” does
stand for a genuine quality or relation. And a superficial consideration
of these sentences might lead one to suppose that there was something
more in the question “What is truth?” than a demand for the analysis of
the sentence “p is true.” But when one comes to analyse the sentences in
question, one always finds that they contain sub-sentences of the form
“p is true” or “p is false,” and that when they are translated in such a
way as to make these sub-sentences explicit, they contain no other
mention of truth. Thus, to take two typical examples, the sentence “A
proposition is not made true by being believed” is equivalent to “for no
value of p or x, is ‘p is true’ entailed by ‘x believes p’”: and the
sentence “Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction” is equivalent to
“There are values of p and q such that p is true and q is false and p is
more surprising than q.” And the same result would be yielded by any
other example one cared to take. In every case the analysis of the
sentence would confirm our assumption that the question “What is truth?”
is reducible to the question “What is the analysis of the sentence ‘p is
true’?” And it is plain that this question raises no genuine problem,
since we have shown that to say that p is true is simply a way of
asserting p.78</p>
<p>We conclude, then, that there is no problem of truth as it is
ordinarily conceived. The traditional conception of truth as a “real
quality” or a “real relation” is due, like most philosophical mistakes,
to a failure to analyse sentences correctly. There are sentences, such
as the two we have just analysed, in which the word “truth” seems to
stand for something real; and this leads the speculative philosopher to
enquire what this “something” is. Naturally he fails to obtain a
satisfactory answer, since his question is illegitimate. For our
analysis has shown that the word “truth” does not stand for anything, in
the way which such a question requires.</p>
<p>It follows that if all theories of truth were theories about the
“real quality” or the “real relation,” which the word “truth” is naively
supposed to stand for, they would be all nonsense. But in fact they are
for the most part theories of an entirely different sort. Whatever
question their authors may think that they are discussing, what they are
really discussing most of the time is the question “What makes a
proposition true or false?” And this is a loose way of expressing the
question “With regard to any proposition p, what are the conditions in
which p (is true) and what are the conditions in which not?” In other
words, it is a way of asking how propositions are validated. And this is
the question which we were considering when we embarked on our
digression about the analysis of truth.</p>
<p>In saying that we propose to show “how propositions are validated,”
we do not of course mean to suggest that all propositions are validated
in the same way. On the contrary we lay stress on the fact that the
criterion by which we determine the validity of an a priori or analytic
proposition is not sufficient to determine the validity of an empirical
or synthetic proposition. For it is characteristic of empirical
propositions that their validity is not purely formal. To say that a
geometrical proposition, or a system of geometrical propositions, is
false is to say that it is self-contradictory. But an empirical
proposition, or a system of empirical propositions, may be free from
contradiction, and still be false. It is said to be false, not because
it is formally defective, but because it fails to satisfy some material
criterion. And it is our business to discover what this criterion
is.</p>
<p>We have been assuming so far that empirical propositions, though they
differ from a priori propositions in their method of validation, do not
differ in this respect among themselves. Having found that all a priori
propositions are validated in the same way, we have taken it for granted
that this holds good of empirical propositions also. But this assumption
would be challenged by a great many philosophers who agree with us in
most other respects.79 They would say that among empirical propositions,
there was a special class of propositions whose validity consisted in
the fact that they directly recorded an immediate experience. They
maintain that these propositions, which we may call “ostensive”
propositions, are not mere hypotheses but are absolutely certain. For
they are supposed to be purely demonstrative in character, and so
incapable of being refuted by any subsequent experience. And they are,
on this view, the only empirical propositions which are certain. The
rest are hypotheses which derive what validity they have from their
relationship to the ostensive propositions. For their probability is
held to be determined by the number and variety of the ostensive
propositions which can be deduced from them.</p>
<p>That no synthetic proposition which is not purely ostensive can be
logically indubitable, may be granted without further ado. What we
cannot admit is that any synthetic proposition can be purely
ostensive.80 For the notion of an ostensive proposition appears to
involve a contradiction in terms. It implies that there could be a
sentence which, consisted of purely demonstrative symbols and was at the
same time intelligible. And this is not even a logical possibility. A
sentence which consisted of demonstrative symbols would not express a
genuine proposition. It would be a mere ejaculation, in no way
characterizing that to which it was supposed to refer.81</p>
<p>The fact is that one cannot in language point to an object without
describing it. If a sentence is to express a proposition, it cannot
merely name a situation; it must say something about it. And in
describing a situation, one is not merely “registering” a sense-content;
one is classifying it in some way or other, and this means going beyond
what is immediately given. But a proposition would be ostensive only if
it recorded what was immediately experienced, without referring in any
way beyond. And as this is not possible, it follows that no genuine
synthetic proposition can be ostensive, and consequently that none can
be absolutely certain.</p>
<p>Accordingly we hold not merely that no ostensive propositions ever
are expressed, but that it is inconceivable that any ostensive
proposition ever should be expressed. That no ostensive propositions
ever are expressed might be admitted even by those who believe in them.
They might allow that in actual practice one never limits oneself to
describing the qualities of an immediately presented sense-content, but
always treats it as if it were a material thing. And it is obvious that
the propositions in which we formulate our ordinary judgements about
material things are not ostensive, referring as they do to an infinite
series of actual and possible sense-contents. But it is in principle
possible to formulate propositions which simply describe the qualities
of sense-contents without expressing perceptual judgements. And it is
claimed that these artificial propositions would be genuinely ostensive.
It should be clear from what we have already said that this claim is
unjustified. And if any doubt on this point still remains, we may remove
it with the help of an example.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that I assert the proposition “This is white,” and my
words are taken to refer, not, as they normally would, to some material
thing, but to a sense-content. Then what I am saying about this
sense-content is that it is an element in the class of sense-contents
which constitutes “white” for me; or in other words that it is similar
in colour to certain other sense-contents, namely those which I should
call, or actually have called, white. And I think I am saying also that
it corresponds in some fashion to the sense-contents which go to
constitute “white” for other people: so that if I discovered that I had
an abnormal colour-sense, I should admit that the sense-content in
question was not white. But even if we exclude all reference to other
people, it is still possible to think of a situation which would lead me
to suppose that my classification of a sense-content was mistaken. I
might, for example, have discovered that whenever I sensed a
sense-content of a certain quality, I made some distinctive overt bodily
movement; and I might on one occasion be presented with a sense-content
which I asserted to be of that quality, and then fail to make the bodily
reaction which I had come to associate with it. In such a case I should
probably abandon the hypothesis that sense-contents of that quality
always called out in me the bodily reaction in question. But I should
not, logically, be obliged to abandon it. If I found it more convenient,
I could save this hypothesis by assuming that I really did make the
reaction, although I did not notice it, or, alternatively, that the
sense-content did not have the quality I asserted it to have. The fact
that this course is a possible one, that it involves no logical
contradiction, proves that a proposition which describes the quality of
a presented sense-content may as legitimately be doubted as any other
empirical proposition.82 And this shows that such a proposition is not
ostensive, for we have seen that an ostensive proposition could not
legitimately be doubted. But propositions describing the actual
qualities of presented sense-contents are the only examples of ostensive
propositions which those who believe in ostensive propositions have ever
ventured to give. And if these propositions are not ostensive, it is
certain that none are.</p>
<p>In denying the possibility of ostensive propositions, we are not of
course denying that there really is a “given” element in each of our
sense-experiences. Nor are we suggesting that our sensations are
themselves doubtful. Indeed such a suggestion would be nonsensical. A
sensation is not the sort of thing which can be doubtful or not
doubtful. A sensation simply occurs. What are doubtful are the
propositions which refer to our sensations, including the propositions
which describe the qualities of a presented sense-content, or assert
that a certain sense-content has occurred. To identify a proposition of
this sort with the sensation itself would clearly be a gross logical
blunder. Yet I fancy that the doctrine of ostensive propositions is the
outcome of such a tacit identification. It is difficult to account for
it in any other way.83</p>
<p>However, we shall not waste time speculating about the origins of
this false philosophical doctrine. Such questions may be left to the
historian. Our business is to show that the doctrine is false, and this
we may fairly claim to have done. It should now be clear that there are
no absolutely certain empirical propositions. It is only tautologies
that are certain. Empirical propositions are one and all hypotheses,
which may be confirmed or discredited in actual sense-experience. And
the propositions in which we record the observations that verify these
hypotheses are themselves hypotheses which are subject to the test of
further sense-experience. Thus there are no final propositions. When we
set about verifying a hypothesis we may make an observation which
satisfies us at the time. But the very next moment we may doubt whether
the observation really did take place, and require a fresh process of
verification in order to be reassured. And, logically, there is no
reason why this procedure should not continue indefinitely, each act of
verification supplying us with a new hypothesis, which in turn leads to
a further series of acts of verification. In practice we assume that
certain types of observation are trustworthy, and admit the hypothesis
that they have occurred without bothering to embark on a process of
verification. But we do this, not from obedience to any logical
necessity, but from a purely pragmatic motive, the nature of which will
shortly be explained.</p>
<p>When one speaks of hypotheses being verified in experience, it is
important to bear in mind that it is never just a single hypothesis
which an observation confirms or discredits, but always a system of
hypotheses. Suppose that we have devised an experiment to test the
validity of a scientific “law.” The law states that in certain
conditions a certain type of observation will always be forthcoming. It
may happen in this particular instance that we make the observation as
our law predicts. Then it is not only the law itself that is
substantiated, but also the hypotheses which assert the existence of the
requisite conditions. For it is only by assuming the existence of these
conditions that we can hold that our observation is relevant to the law.
Alternatively, we may fail to make the expected observation. And in that
case we may conclude that the law is invalidated by our experiment. But
we are not obliged to adopt this conclusion. If we wish to preserve our
law, we may do so by abandoning one or more of the other relevant
hypotheses. We may say that the conditions were really not what they
seemed to be, and construct a theory to explain how we came to be
mistaken about them; or we may say that some factor which we had
dismissed as irrelevant was really relevant, and support this view with
supplementary hypotheses. We may even assume that the experiment was
really not unfavourable, and that our negative observation was
hallucinatory. And in that case we must bring the hypotheses which
record the conditions that are deemed necessary for the occurrence of a
hallucination into line with the hypotheses which describe the
conditions in which this observation is supposed to have taken place.
Otherwise we shall be maintaining incompatible hypotheses. And this is
the one thing that we may not do. But, so long as we take suitable steps
to keep our system of hypotheses free from self-contradiction, we may
adopt any explanation .of our observations that we choose. In practice
our choice of an explanation is guided by certain considerations, which
we shall presently describe. And these considerations have the effect of
limiting our freedom in the matter of preserving and rejecting
hypotheses. But logically our freedom is unlimited. Any procedure which
is self-consistent will satisfy the requirements of logic.</p>
<p>It appears, then, that the “facts of experience” can never compel us
to abandon a hypothesis. A man can always sustain his convictions in the
face of apparently hostile evidence if he is prepared to make the
necessary ad hoc assumptions. But although any particular instance in
which a cherished hypothesis appears to be refuted can always be
explained away, there must still remain the possibility that the
hypothesis will ultimately be abandoned. Otherwise it is not a genuine
hypothesis. For a proposition whose validity we are resolved to maintain
in the face of any experience is not a hypothesis at all, but a
definition. In other words, it is not a synthetic but an analytic
proposition.</p>
<p>That some of our most hallowed “laws of nature” are merely disguised
definitions is, I think, incontestable, but this is not a question that
we can go into here.84 It is sufficient for us to point out that there
is a danger of mistaking such definitions for genuine hypotheses, a
danger which is increased by the fact that the same form of words may at
one time, or for one set of people, express a synthetic proposition, and
at another time, or for another set of people, express a tautology. For
our definitions of things are not immutable. And if experience leads us
to entertain a very strong belief that everything of the kind A has the
property of being a B, we tend to make the possession of this property a
defining characteristic of the kind. Ultimately we may refuse to call
anything A unless it is also a B. And in that case the sentence 95 “All
A’s are B’s,” which originally expressed a synthetic generalization,
would come to express a plain tautology.</p>
<p>One good reason for drawing attention to this possibility is that the
neglect of it by philosophers is responsible for much of the confusion
that infects their treatment of general propositions. Consider the stock
example, “All men are mortal.” We are told that this is not a doubtful
hypothesis, as Hume maintained, but an instance of a necessary
connection. And if we ask what it is that is here necessarily connected,
the only answer that appears possible to us is that it is the concept of
“man” and the concept of “being mortal.” But the only meaning which we
attach to the statement that two concepts are necessarily connected is
that the sense of one concept is contained in that of the other. Thus to
say that “All men are mortal” is an instance of a necessary connection
is to say that the concept of being mortal is contained in the concept
of man, and this amounts to saying that “All men are mortal” is a
tautology. Now the philosopher may use the word “man” in such a way that
he would refuse to call anything a man unless it were mortal. And in
that case the sentence “All men are mortal” will, as far as he is
concerned, express a tautology. But this does not mean that the
proposition which we ordinarily express by that sentence is a tautology.
Even for our philosopher, it remains a genuine empirical hypothesis.
Only he cannot now express it in the form, “All men are mortal.”
Instead, he must say that everything which has the other defining
properties of a man also has the property of being mortal, or something
to that effect. Thus we may create tautologies by a suitable adjustment
of our definitions: but we cannot solve empirical problems merely by
juggling with the meanings of words.</p>
<p>Of course, when a philosopher says that the proposition “All men are
mortal” is an instance of a necessary connection, he does not intend to
say that it is a tautology. It is left to us to point out that this is
all he can be saying, if his words are to bear their ordinary sense and
at the same time express a significant proposition. But I think that he
finds it possible to hold that this general proposition is both
synthetic and necessary, only because he identifies it tacitly with the
tautology which might, given suitable conventions, be expressed by the
same form of words. And the same applies to all other general
propositions of law. We may turn the sentences which now express them
into expressions of definitions. And then these sentences will express
necessary propositions. But these will be different propositions from
the original generalizations. They, as Hume saw, can never be necessary.
However firmly we believe them, it is always conceivable that a future
experience will lead us to abandon them.</p>
<p>This brings us once more to the question, What are the considerations
that determine in any given situation which of the relevant hypotheses
shall be preserved and which shall be abandoned? It is sometimes
suggested that we are guided solely by the principle of economy, or, in
other words, by our desire to make the least possible alteration in our
previously accepted system of hypotheses. But though we undoubtedly have
this desire, and are influenced by it to some extent, it is not the
sole, or even the dominant, factor in our procedure. If our concern was
simply to keep our existing system of hypotheses intact, we should not
feel obliged to take any notice of an unfavourable observation. We
should not feel the need to account for it in any way whatsoever —not
even by introducing the hypothesis that we had just had a hallucination.
We should simply ignore it. But, in fact, we do not disregard
inconvenient observations. Their occurrence always causes us to make
some alteration in our system of hypotheses in spite of our desire to
keep it intact. Why is this so? If we can answer this question, and show
why we find it necessary to alter our systems of hypotheses at all, we
shall be in a better position to decide what are the principles
according to which such alterations are actually carried out.</p>
<p>What we must do to solve this problem is to ask ourselves, What is
the purpose of formulating hypotheses? Why do we construct these systems
in the first place? The answer is that they are designed to enable us to
anticipate the course of our sensations. The function of a system of
hypotheses is to warn us beforehand what will be our experience in a
certain field—to enable us to make accurate predictions. The hypotheses
may therefore be described as rules which govern our expectation of
future experience. There is no need to say why we require such rules. It
is plain that on our ability to make successful predictions depends the
satisfaction of even our simplest desires, including the desire to
survive.</p>
<p>Now the essential feature of our procedure with regard to the
formulation of these rules is the use of past experience as a guide to
the future. We have already remarked upon this, when discussing the
so-called problem of induction, and we have seen that there is no sense
in asking for a theoretical justification of this policy. The
philosopher must be content to record the facts of scientific procedure.
If he seeks to justify it, beyond showing that it is self-consistent, he
will find himself involved in spurious problems. This is a point which
we stressed earlier on, and we shall not trouble to argue it over
again.</p>
<p>We remark, then, as a fact that our forecasts of future experience
are in some way determined by what we have experienced in the past. And
this fact explains why science, which is essentially predictive, is also
to some extent a description of our experience.85 But it is noticeable
that we tend to ignore those features of our experience which cannot be
made the basis of fruitful generalizations. And, furthermore, that which
we do describe, we describe with some latitude. As Poincaré puts it:
“One does not limit oneself to generalizing experience, one corrects it;
and the physicist who consented to abstain from these corrections and
really be satisfied with bare experience would be obliged to promulgate
the most extraordinary laws.”86</p>
<p>But even if we do not follow past experience slavishly in making our
predictions, we are guided by it to a very large extent. And this
explains why we do not simply disregard the conclusion of an
unfavourable experiment. We assume that a system of hypotheses which has
broken down once is likely to break down again. We could, of course,
assume that it had not broken down at all, but we believe that this
assumption would not pay us so well as the recognition that the system
had really failed us, and therefore required some alteration if it was
not to fail us again. We alter our system because we think that by
altering it we shall make it a more efficient instrument for the
anticipation of experience. And this belief is derived from our guiding
principle that, broadly speaking, the future course of our sensations
will be in accordance with the past.</p>
<p>This desire of ours to have an efficient set of rules for our
predictions, which causes us to take notice of unfavourable
observations, is also the factor which primarily determines how we
adjust our system to cover the new data. It is true that we are infected
with a spirit of conservatism and would rather make small alterations
than large ones. It is disagreeable and troublesome for us to admit that
our existing system is radically defective. And it is true that, other
things being equal, we prefer simple to complex hypotheses, again from
the desire to save ourselves trouble. But if experience leads us to
suppose that radical changes are necessary, then we are prepared to make
them, even though they do complicate our system, as the recent history
of physics shows. When an observation runs counter to our most confident
expectations, the easiest course is to ignore it, or at any rate to
explain it away. If we do not do this, it is because we think that, if
we leave our system as it is, we shall suffer further disappointments.
We think it will increase the efficiency of our system as an instrument
of prediction if we make it compatible with the hypothesis that the
unexpected observation occurred. Whether we are right in thinking this
is a question which cannot be settled by argument. We can only wait and
see if our new system is successful in practice. If it is not, we alter
it once again.</p>
<p>We have now obtained the information we required in order to answer
our original question, “What is the criterion by which we test the
validity of an empirical proposition?” The answer is that we test the
validity of an empirical hypothesis by seeing whether it actually
fulfils the function which it is designed to fulfil. And we have seen
that the function of an empirical hypothesis is to enable us to
anticipate experience. Accordingly, if an observation to which a given
proposition is relevant conforms to our expectations, the truth of that
proposition is confirmed. One cannot say that the proposition has been
proved absolutely valid, because it is still possible that a future
observation will discredit it. But one can say that its probability has
been increased. If the observation is contrary to our expectations, then
the status of the proposition is jeopardised. We may preserve it by
adopting or abandoning other hypotheses: or we may consider it to have
been confuted. But even if it is rejected in consequence of an
unfavourable observation, one cannot say that it has been invalidated
absolutely. For it is still possible that future observations will lead
us to reinstate it. One can say only that its probability has been
diminished.</p>
<p>It is necessary now to make clear what is meant in this context by
the term “probability.” In referring to the probability of a
proposition, we are not, as is sometimes supposed, referring to an
intrinsic property of it, or even to an unanalysable logical relation
which holds between it and other propositions. Roughly speaking, all
that we mean by saying that an observation increases the probability of
a proposition is that it increases our confidence in the proposition, as
measured by our willingness to rely on it in practice as a forecast of
our sensations, and to retain it in preference to other hypotheses in
face of an unfavourable experience. And, similarly, to say of an
observation that it diminishes the probability of a proposition is to
say that it decreases our willingness to include the proposition in the
system of accepted hypotheses which serve us as guides to the
future.87</p>
<p>As it stands, this account of the notion of probability is somewhat
over-simplified. For it assumes that we deal with all hypotheses in a
uniform self-consistent fashion, and this is unfortunately not the case.
In practice, we do not always relate belief to observation in the way
which is generally recognized to be the most reliable. Although we
acknowledge that certain standards of evidence ought always to be
observed in the formation of our beliefs, we do not always observe them.
In other words, we are not always rational. For to be rational is simply
to employ a self-consistent accredited procedure in the formation of all
one’s beliefs. The fact that the procedure, by reference to which we now
determine whether a belief is rational, may subsequently forfeit our
confidence, does not in any way detract from the rationality of adopting
it now. For we define a rational belief as one which is arrived at by
the methods which we now consider reliable. There is no absolute
standard of rationality, just as there is no method of constructing
hypotheses which is guaranteed to be reliable. We trust the methods of
contemporary science because they have been successful in practice. If
in the future we were to adopt different methods, then beliefs which are
now rational might become irrational from the standpoint of these new
methods. But the fact that this is possible has no bearing on the fact
that these beliefs are rational now.</p>
<p>This definition of rationality enables us to amend our account of
what is meant by the term “probability,” in the usage with which we are
now concerned. To say that an observation increases the probability of a
hypothesis is not always equivalent to saying that it increases the
degree of confidence with which we actually entertain the hypothesis, as
measured by our readiness to act upon it: for we may be behaving
irrationally. It is equivalent to saying that the observation increases
the degree of confidence with which it is rational to entertain the
hypothesis. And here we may repeat that the rationality of a belief is
defined, not by reference to any absolute standard, but by reference to
part of our own actual practice.</p>
<p>The obvious objection to our original definition of probability was
that it was incompatible with the fact that one is sometimes mistaken
about the probability of a proposition—that one can believe it to be
more or less probable than it really is. It is plain that our amended
definition escapes this objection. For, according to it, the probability
of a proposition is determined both by the nature of our observations
and by our conception of rationality. So that when a man relates belief
to observation in a way which is inconsistent with the accredited
scientific method of evaluating hypotheses, it is compatible with our
definition of probability to say that he is mistaken about the
probability of the propositions which he believes.</p>
<p>With this account of probability we complete our discussion of the
validity of empirical propositions. The point which we must finally
stress is that our remarks apply to all empirical propositions without
exception, whether they are singular, or, particular, or universal.
Every synthetic proposition is a rule for the anticipation of future
experience, and is distinguished in content from other synthetic
propositions by the fact that it is relevant to different situations. So
that the fact that propositions referring to the past have the same
hypothetical character as those which refer to the present, and those
which refer to the future, in no way entails that these three types of
proposition are not distinct. For they are verified by, and so serve to
predict, different experiences.</p>
<p>It may be their failure to appreciate this point which has caused
certain philosophers to deny that propositions about the past are
hypotheses in the same sense as the laws of a natural science are
hypotheses. For they have not been able to support their view by any
substantial arguments, or to say what propositions about the past are,
if they are not hypotheses, of the sort we have just described. For my
own part, I do not find anything excessively paradoxical in the view
that propositions about the past are rules for the prediction of those
“historical” experiences which are commonly said to verify them,88 and I
do not see how else “our knowledge of the past” is to be analysed. And I
suspect, moreover, that those who object to our pragmatic treatment of
history are really basing their objections on a tacit, or explicit,
assumption that the past is somehow “objectively there” to be
corresponded to—that it is “real” in the metaphysical sense of the term.
And from what we have remarked concerning the metaphysical issue of
idealism and realism, it is clear that such an assumption is not a
genuine hypothesis.89</p>
