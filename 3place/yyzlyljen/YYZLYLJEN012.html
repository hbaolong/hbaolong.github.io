<p>7 cf. Bertrand Russell, The Problems of Philosophy, p. 91: “Every
proposition which we can understand must be composed wholly of
constituents with which we are acquainted.” And, if I understand him
correctly, this is what Professor W. T. Stace has in mind when he speaks
of a “Principle of Observable Kinds.” Vide his “Positivism,” Mind, 1944.
Stace argues that the principle of verification “rests upon” the
principle of observable kinds, but this is a mistake. It is true that
every statement that is allowed to be meaningful by the principle of
observable kinds is also allowed to be meaningful by the principle of
verification: but the converse does not hold.</p>
<p>8 Both Dr. A. C. Ewing, “Meaninglessness,” Mind, 1937, pp. 347—64,
and Stace, op. cit., take it to be an empirical hypothesis.</p>
<p>9 e.g. by Professor C. D. Broad, “Are these Synthetic a priori
Truths,” Supplementary Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Vol.
XV.</p>
<p>10 This contradicts what I said in my contribution to a symposium on
“Truth by Convention,” Analysis, Vol. 4, Nos. 2 and 3; cf. also Norman
Malcolm, “Are Necessary Propositions really Verbal,” Mind, 1940,
pp. 189—203.</p>

Propositions,” Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 1940; cf. also

<p>15 My confidence in it has been somewhat increased by John Wisdom’s
interesting series of articles on “Other Minds,” Mind, 1940—3. But I am
not sure that this is the effect that he intended them to produce.</p>
<p>16 cf. Sir W. David Ross, The Foundations of Ethics, pp. 30—41.</p>
<p>17 I understand that this deficiency has been made good by C. L.
Stevenson in his book, Ethics and Language, but the book was published
in America and I have not yet been able to obtain it. There is a review
of it by Austin Duncan-Jones in Mind, October, 1945, and a good
indication of Stevenson’s line of argument is to be found in his
articles on “The Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms,” Mind, 1937, “Ethical
Judgements and Avoidability,” Mind, 1938, and “Persuasive Definitions,”
Mind, 1938.</p>

of the Aristotelian Society, 1936. I have made use of the same
illustration in my paper on “Does Philosophy analyse Common Sense?”
symposium with A. E. Duncan-Jones, Supplementary Proceedings of the
Aristotelian Society, 1937.</p>
<p>25 I do not wish to imply that Moore himself was solely, or even
primarily, concerned with refuting the ontological argument. But I think
that his reasoning does achieve this, though not this alone. Similarly
Russell’s “theory of descriptions” has other uses besides relieving us
of “subsistent entities,”</p>
<p>26 Vide “Does Philosophy analyse Common Sense?” and Duncan-Jones’
paper on the same subject, Supplementary Proceedings of the Aristotelian
Society, 1937; cf. also John Wisdom, “Metaphysics and Verification,”
Mind, 1938, and “Philosophy, Anxiety and Novelty,” Mind, 1944.</p>
<p>27 I have put in the qualifying word “usually” because I think that
some empirical propositions, such as those that occur in histories of
philosophy, may be counted as philosophical. And philosophers use
empirical propositions as examples, to serve philosophical ends. But, in
so far as they are not merely historical, I think that the truths
discoverable by philosophical methods are analytic. At the same time I
should add that the philosopher’s business, as Professor Ryle has
pointed out to me, is rather to “solve puzzles” than to discover
truths.</p>

<p>30 This example has been used by Professor Schlick to illustrate the
same point.</p>

Bradley.</p>

Natur-wissenschaft, Vol. 19, 1931.</p>
<p>34 This has been proposed by Karl Popper in his Logik der
Forschung.</p>
<p>35 This is an over-simplified statement, which is not literally
correct. I give what I believe to be the correct formulation in the

in his “Uberwindung der Metaphysik durch logische Analyse der Sprache,”

<p>43 For a discussion of this point, see also C. A. Mace,

<p>47 Vide A Treatise of Human Nature, Book I, Part III, section 15.</p>
<p>48 An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, section 7.</p>
<p>49 Carnap has stressed this point. Where we speak of “linguistic”
propositions expressed in “factual” or “pseudo-factual” language he
speaks of “Pseudo-Objektsätze” or “quasi-syntaktische Sätze” as being
expressed in the “Inhalt-liche,” as opposed to the “Formale Redeweise.”

<p>51 cf. Rudolf Carnap, Logische Syntax der Sprache, Part V, 79B, and

<p>52 That this statement needs to be qualified is shown in the
Introduction, pp. 24 ff.</p>
<p>53 Vide Principia Mathematica, Introduction, Chapter iii, and
Introduction to Mathematical Philisophy, Chapter xvi.</p>
<p>54 This is not quite accurate, vide Introduction, pp. 22-4.</p>

actually employ a single, precise system of symbols. Vide pp. 70-1.</p>

<p>58 See H. H. Price, Perception, p. 218.</p>
<p>59 There is a ground for saying that the philosopher is always
concerned with an artificial language. For the conventions which we
follow in our actual usage of words are not altogether systematic and
precise.</p>
<p>60 Thus if I wish to refute a philosophical opponent I do not argue
about people’s linguistic habits. I try to prove that his definitions
involve a contradiction. Suppose, for example, that he is maintaining
that “A is a free agent” is equivalent to “A’s actions are uncaused.”
Then I refute him by getting him to admit that “A is a free agent” is
entailed by “A is morally responsible for his actions” whereas “A’s
actions are uncaused” entails “A is not morally responsible for his
actions.”</p>

<p>81 This question is reviewed in the Introduction, pp. 10-11.</p>
<p>82 Of course those who believe in “ostensive” propositions do not
maintain that such a proposition as “This is white” is valid in virtue
of its form alone. What they assert is that I am entitled to regard the
proposition “This is white” as objectively certain when I am actually
experiencing a white sense-content. But can it really be the case that
they mean to assert no more than the trivial tautology that when I am
seeing something white, then I am seeing something white? See following
footnote.</p>
<p>83 It has subsequently occurred to me that the doctrine of ostensive
propositions may be due to the confusion of the proposition “It is
certain that p implies p”—e.g. “It is certain that if I am in pain, then
I am in pain”—which is a tautology, with the proposition “p implies that
(p is certain)”—e.g. “If I am in pain, then the proposition ‘I am in
pain’ is certain,” which is, in general, false. Vide my article on “The
Criterion of Truth,” Analysis, Vol. III, Nos. 1 and 2.</p>
<p>84 For an elaboration of this view, see H. Poincaré, La Science et
l’Hypothèse.</p>
<p>85 It will be seen that even “descriptions of past experience” are in
a sense predictive since they function as “rules for the anticipation of
future experience.” See the end of this chapter for an elaboration of
this point.</p>
<p>86 La Science et l’Hypothèse, Part IV, Chapter ix, p. 170.</p>
<p>87 This definition is not, of course, intended to apply to the
mathematical usage of the term “probability.”</p>
<p>88 The implications of this statement may be misleading, vide

<p>89 The case for a pragmatic treatment of history, in our sense, is

<p>101 This question is referred to in the Introduction, pp. 19-20.</p>
<p>102 This argument is used by Professor L. S. Stebbing in her article
on “Communication and Verification,” Supplementary Proceedings of the
Aristotelian Society, 1934.</p>
<p>103 See Hans Hahn, “Logik, Mathematik und Naturerkennen,”
Einheitswissenschaft, Heft II, for a discussion of this question.</p>
<p>104 Vide G. E. Moore, Philosophical Studies, “The Refutation of
Idealism.”</p>
<p>105 This point is made also by Rudolf Carnap in Der logische Aufbau
der Welt, section 65.</p>
<p>106 Vide The First Dialogue between Hylas and Philonous.</p>
<p>107 Philosophical Studies, “The Conception of Reality.”</p>
<p>108 cf. W. Stace, “The Refutation of Realism,” Mind, 1934.</p>
<p>109 The passage which follows, down to the end of the paragraph, was
incorporated also in a paper on “Internal Relations” which was read at
the 1935 joint session of Mind Association and Aristotelian Society. See
the Supplementary Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 1935.</p>
<p>110 An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, section iv.</p>
<p>111 What is required to put an end to this is the fulfilment of
Leibnitz’s hope for a “Characteristica Universalis.” Cf. Otto Neurath,
“Einheitswissenschaft und Psychologie,” Einheitswissenschaft, Heft I,
and “Einheit der Wissenschaft als Aufgabe,” Erkenntnis, Band V, Heft I.
Also Rudolf Carnap, “Die physikalische Sprache als Universalsprache der
Wissenschaft,” Erkenntnis, Vol. II, 1932, and English translation, The
Unity of Science, and “Die Aufgabe der Wissenschafts-logik,”
Einheitswissenschaft, Heft III.</p>
