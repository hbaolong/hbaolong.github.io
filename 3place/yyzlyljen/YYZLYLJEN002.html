<h4 id="preface-to-first-edition">PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION</h4>
<p>THE VIEWS which are put forward in this treatise derive from the
doctrines of Bertrand Russell and Wittgenstein, which are themselves the
logical outcome of the empiricism of Berkeley and David Hume. Like Hume,
I divide all genuine propositions into two classes: those which, in his
terminology, concern “relations of ideas,” and those which concern
“matters of fact.” The former class comprises the a priori propositions
of logic and pure mathematics, and these I allow to be necessary and
certain only because they are analytic. That is, I maintain that the
reason why these propositions cannot be confuted in experience is that
they do not make any assertion about the empirical world, but simply
record our determination to use symbols in a certain fashion.
Propositions concerning empirical matters of fact, on the other hand, I
hold to be hypotheses, which can be probable but never certain. And in
giving an account of the method of their validation I claim also to have
explained the nature of truth.</p>
<p>To test whether a sentence expresses a genuine empirical hypothesis,
I adopt what may be called a modified verification principle. For I
require of an empirical hypothesis, not indeed that it should be
conclusively verifiable, but that some possible sense-experience should
be relevant to the determination of its truth or falsehood. If a
putative proposition fails to satisfy this principle, and is not a
tautology, then I hold that it is metaphysical, and that, being
metaphysical, it is neither true nor false but literally senseless. It
will be found that much of what ordinarily passes for philosophy is
metaphysical according to this criterion, and, in particular, that it
can not be significantly asserted that there is a non-empirical world of
values, or that men have immortal souls, or that there is a transcendent
God.</p>
<p>As for the propositions of philosophy themselves, they are held to be
linguistically necessary, and so analytic. And with regard to the
relationship of philosophy and empirical science, it is, shown that the
philosopher is not in a position to furnish speculative truths, which
would, as it were, compete with the hypotheses of science, nor yet to
pass a priori judgements upon the validity of scientific theories, but
that his function is to clarify the propositions of science by
exhibiting their logical relationships, and by defining the symbols
which occur in them. Consequently I maintain that there is nothing in
the nature of philosophy to warrant the existence of conflicting
philosophical “schools.” And I attempt to substantiate this by providing
a definitive solution of the problems which have been the chief sources
of controversy between philosophers in the past.</p>
<p>The view that philosophizing is an activity of analysis is associated
in England with the work of G. E. Moore and his disciples. But while I
have learned a great deal from Professor Moore, I have reason to believe
that he and his followers are not prepared to adopt such a thoroughgoing
phenomenalism as I do, and that they take a rather different view of the
nature of philosophical analysis. The philosophers with whom I am in the
closest agreement are those who compose the “Viennese circle,” under the
leadership of Moritz Schlick, and are commonly known as logical
positivists. And of these I owe most to Rudolf Carnap. Further, I wish
to acknowledge my indebtedness to Gilbert Ryle, my original tutor in
philosophy, and to Isaiah Berlin, who have discussed with me every point
in the argument of this treatise, and made many valuable suggestions,
although they both disagree with much of what I assert. And I must also
express my thanks to J. R. M. Willis for his correction of the
proofs.</p>
