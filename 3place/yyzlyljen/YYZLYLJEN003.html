<h4 id="chapter-i-the-elimination-of-metaphysics">CHAPTER I THE
ELIMINATION OF METAPHYSICS</h4>
<p>THE TRADITIONAL DISPUTES of philosophers are, for the most part, as
unwarranted as they are unfruitful. The surest way to end them is to
establish beyond question what should be the purpose and method of a
philosophical enquiry. And this is by no means so difficult a task as
the history of philosophy would lead one to suppose. For if there are
any questions which science leaves it to philosophy to answer, a
straightforward process of elimination must lead to their discovery.</p>
<p>We may begin by criticising the metaphysical thesis that philosophy
affords us knowledge of a reality transcending the world of science and
common sense. Later on, when we come to define metaphysics and account
for its existence, we shall find that it is possible to be a
metaphysician without believing in a transcendent reality; for we shall
see that many metaphysical utterances are due to the commission of
logical errors, rather than to a conscious desire on the part of their
authors to go beyond the limits of experience. But it is convenient for
us to take the case of those who believe that it is possible to have
knowledge of a transcendent reality as a starting-point for our
discussion. The arguments which we use to refute them will subsequently
be found to apply to the whole of metaphysics.</p>
<p>One way of attacking a metaphysician who claimed to have knowledge of
a reality which transcended the phenomenal world would be to enquire
from what premises his propositions were deduced. Must he not begin, as
other men do, with the evidence of his senses? And if so, what valid
process of reasoning can possibly lead him to the conception of a
transcendent reality? Surely from empirical premises nothing whatsoever
concerning the properties, or even the existence, of anything
super-empirical can legitimately be inferred. But this objection would
be met by a denial on the part of the metaphysician that his assertions
were ultimately based on the evidence of his senses. He would say that
he was endowed with a faculty of intellectual intuition which enabled
him to know facts that could not be known through sense-experience. And
even if it could be shown that he was relying on empirical premises, and
that his venture into a non-empirical world was therefore logically
unjustified, it would not follow that the assertions which he made
concerning this non-empirical world could not be true. For the fact that
a conclusion does not follow from its putative premise is not sufficient
to show that it is false. Consequently one cannot overthrow a system of
transcendent metaphysics merely by criticising the way in which it comes
into being. What is required is rather a criticism of the nature of the
actual statements which comprise it. And this is the line of argument
which we shall, in fact, pursue. For we shall maintain that no statement
which refers to a “reality” transcending the limits of all possible
sense-experience can possibly have any literal significance; from which
it must follow that the labours of those who have striven to describe
such a reality have all been devoted to the production of nonsense.</p>
<p>It may be suggested that this is a proposition which has already been
proved by Kant. But although Kant also condemned transcendent
metaphysics, he did so on different grounds. For he said that the human
understanding was so constituted that it lost itself in contradictions
when it ventured out beyond the limits of possible experience and
attempted to deal with things in themselves. And thus he made the
impossibility of a transcendent metaphysic not, as we do, a matter of
logic, but a matter of fact. He asserted, not that our minds could not
conceivably have had the power of penetrating beyond the phenomenal
world, but merely that they were in fact devoid of it. And this leads
the critic to ask how, if it is possible to know only what lies within
the bounds of sense-experience, the author can be justified in asserting
that real things do exist beyond, and how he can tell what are the
boundaries beyond which the human understanding may not venture, unless
he succeeds in passing them himself. As Wittgenstein says, “in order to
draw a limit to thinking, we should have to think both sides of this
limit,”28 a truth to which Bradley gives a special twist in maintaining
that the man who is ready to prove that metaphysics is impossible is a
brother metaphysician with a rival theory of his own.29</p>
<p>Whatever force these objections may have against the Kantian
doctrine, they have none whatsoever against the thesis that I am about
to set forth. It cannot here be said that the author is himself
overstepping the barrier he maintains to be impassable. For the
fruitlessness of attempting to transcend the limits of possible
sense-experience will be deduced, not from a psychological hypothesis
concerning the actual constitution of the human mind, but from the rule
which determines the literal significance of language. Our charge
against the metaphysician is not that he attempts to employ the
understanding in a field where it cannot profitably venture, but that he
produces sentences which fail to conform to the conditions under which
alone a sentence can be literally significant. Nor are we ourselves
obliged to talk nonsense in order to show that all sentences of a
certain type are necessarily devoid of literal significance. We need
only formulate the criterion which enables us to test whether a sentence
expresses a genuine proposition about a matter of fact, and then point
out that the sentences under consideration fail to satisfy it. And this
we shall now proceed to do. We shall first of all formulate the
criterion in somewhat vague terms, and then give the explanations which
are necessary to render it precise.</p>
<p>The criterion which we use to test the genuineness of apparent
statements of fact is the criterion of verifiability. We say that a
sentence is factually significant to any given person, if, and only if,
he knows how to verify the proposition which it purports to express—that
is, if he knows what observations would lead him, under certain
conditions, to accept the proposition as being true, or reject it as
being false. If, on the other hand, the putative proposition is of such
a character that the assumption of its truth, or falsehood, is
consistent with any assumption whatsoever concerning the nature of his
future experience, then, as far as he is concerned, it is, if not a
tautology, a mere pseudo-proposition. The sentence expressing it may be
emotionally significant to him; but it is not literally significant. And
with regard to questions the procedure is the same. We enquire in every
case what observations would lead us to answer the question, one way or
the other; and, if none can be discovered, we must conclude that the
sentence under consideration does not, as far as we are concerned,
express a genuine question, however strongly its grammatical appearance
may suggest that it does.</p>
<p>As the adoption of this procedure is an essential factor in the
argument of this book, it needs to be examined in detail.</p>
<p>In the first place, it is necessary to draw a distinction between
practical verifiability, and verifiability in principle. Plainly we all
understands, in many cases believe, propositions which we have not in
fact taken steps to verify. Many of these are propositions which we
could verify if we took enough trouble. But there remain a number of
significant propositions, concerning matters of fact, which we could not
verify even if we chose; simply because we lack the practical means of
placing ourselves in the situation where the relevant observations could
be made. A simple and familiar example of such a proposition is the
proposition that there are mountains on the farther side of the moon.30
No rocket has yet been invented which would enable me to go and look at
the farther side of the moon, so that I am unable to decide the matter
by actual observation. But I do know what observations would decide it
for me, if, as is theoretically conceivable, I were once in a position
to make them. And therefore I say that the proposition is verifiable in
principle, if not in practice, and is accordingly significant. On the
other hand, such a metaphysical pseudo-proposition as “the Absolute
enters into, but is itself incapable of, evolution and progress,”31 is
not even in principle verifiable. For one cannot conceive of an
observation which would enable one to determine whether the Absolute
did, or did not, enter into evolution and progress. Of course it is
possible that the author of such a remark is using English words in a
way in which they are not commonly used by English-speaking people, and
that he does, in fact, intend to assert something which could be
empirically verified. But until he makes us understand how the
proposition that he wishes to express would be verified, he fails to
communicate anything to us. And if he admits, as I think the author of
the remark in question would have admitted, that his words were not
intended to express either a tautology or a proposition which was
capable, at least in principle, of being verified, then it follows that
he has made an utterance which has no literal significance even for
himself.</p>
<p>A further distinction which we must make is the distinction between
the “strong” and the “weak” sense of the term “verifiable.” A
proposition is said to be verifiable, in the strong sense of the term,
if, and only if, its truth could be conclusively established in
experience. But it is verifiable, in the weak sense, if it is possible
for experience to render it probable. In which sense are we using the
term when we say that a putative proposition is genuine only if it is
verifiable?</p>
<p>It seems to me that if we adopt conclusive verifiability as our
criterion of significance, as some positivists have proposed,32 our
argument will prove too much. Consider, for example, the case of general
propositions of law—such propositions, namely, as “arsenic is
poisonous”; “all men are mortal”; “a body tends to expand when it is
heated.” It is of the very nature of these propositions that their truth
cannot be established with certainty by any finite series of
observations. But if it is recognised that such general propositions of
law are designed to cover an infinite number of cases, then it must be
admitted that they cannot, even in principle, be verified conclusively.
And then, if we adopt conclusive verifiability as our criterion of
significance, we are logically obliged to treat these general
propositions of law in the same fashion as we treat the statements of
the metaphysician.</p>
<p>In face of this difficulty, some positivists33 have adopted the
heroic course of saying that these general propositions are indeed
pieces of nonsense, albeit an essentially important type of nonsense.
But here the introduction of the term “important” is simply an attempt
to hedge. It serves only to mark the authors’ recognition that their
view is somewhat too paradoxical, without in any way removing the
paradox. Besides, the difficulty is not confined to the case of general
propositions of law, though it is there revealed most plainly. It is
hardly less obvious in the case of propositions about the remote past.
For it must surely be admitted that, however strong the evidence in
favour of historical statements may be, their truth can never become
more than highly probable. And to maintain that they also constituted an
important, or unimportant, type of nonsense would be unplausible, to say
the very least. Indeed, it will be our contention that no proposition,
other than a tautology, can possibly be anything more than a probable
hypothesis. And if this is correct, the principle that a sentence can be
factually significant only if it expresses what is conclusively
verifiable is self-stultifying as a criterion of significance. For it
leads to the conclusion that it is impossible to make a significant
statement of fact at all.</p>
<p>Nor can we accept the suggestion that a sentence should be allowed to
be factually significant if, and only if, it expresses something which
is definitely confutable by experience.34 Those who adopt this course
assume that, although no finite series of observations is ever
sufficient to establish the truth of a hypothesis beyond all possibility
of doubt, there are crucial cases in which a single observation, or
series of observations, can definitely confute it. But, as we shall show
later on, this assumption is false. A hypothesis cannot be conclusively
confuted any more than it can be conclusively verified. For when we take
the occurrence of certain observations as proof that a given hypothesis
is false, we presuppose the existence of certain conditions. And though,
in any given case, it may be extremely improbable that this assumption
is false, it is not logically impossible. We shall see that there need
be no self-contradiction in holding that some of the relevant
circumstances are other than we have taken them to be, and consequently
that the hypothesis has not really broken down. And if it is not the
case that any hypothesis can be definitely confuted, we cannot hold that
the genuineness of a proposition depends on the possibility of its
definite confutation.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we fall back on the weaker sense of verification. We say
that the question that must be asked about any putative statement of
fact is not, Would any observations make its truth or falsehood
logically certain? but simply, Would any observations be relevant to the
determination of its truth or falsehood? And it is only if a negative
answer is given to this second question that we conclude that the
statement under consideration is nonsensical.</p>
<p>To make our position clearer, we may formulate it in another way. Let
us call a proposition which records an actual or possible observation an
experiential proposition. Then we may say that it is the mark of a
genuine factual proposition, not that it should be equivalent to an
experiential proposition, or any finite number of experiential
propositions, but simply that some experiential propositions can be
deduced from it in conjunction with certain other premises without being
deducible from those other premises alone.35</p>
<p>This criterion seems liberal enough. In contrast to the principle of
conclusive verifiability, it clearly does not deny significance to
general propositions or to propositions about the past. Let us see what
kinds of assertion it rules out.</p>
<p>A good example of the kind of utterance that is condemned by our
criterion as being not even false but nonsensical would be the assertion
that the world of sense-experience was altogether unreal. It must, of
course, be admitted that our senses do sometimes deceive us. We may, as
the result of having certain sensations, expect certain other sensations
to be obtainable which are, in fact, not obtainable. But, in all such
cases, it is further sense-experience that informs us of the mistakes
that arise out of sense-experience. We say that the senses sometimes
deceive us, just because the expectations to which our sense-experiences
give rise do not always accord with what we subsequently experience.
That is, we rely on our senses to substantiate or confute the judgements
which are based on our sensations. And therefore the fact that our
perceptual judgements are sometimes found to be erroneous has not the
slightest tendency to show that the world of sense-experience is unreal.
And, indeed, it is plain that no conceivable observation, or series of
observations, could have any tendency to show that the world revealed to
us by sense-experience was unreal. Consequently, anyone who condemns the
sensible world as a world of mere appearance, as opposed to reality, is
saying something which, according to our criterion of significance, is
literally nonsensical.</p>
<p>An example of a controversy which the application of our criterion
obliges us to condemn as fictitious is provided by those who dispute
concerning the number of substances that there are in the world. For it
is admitted both by monists, who maintain that reality is one substance,
and by pluralists, who maintain that reality is many, that it is
impossible to imagine any empirical situation which would be relevant to
the solution of their dispute. But if we are told that no possible
observation could give any probability either to the assertion that
reality was one substance or to the assertion that it was many, then we
must conclude that neither assertion is significant. We shall see later
on36 that there are genuine logical and empirical questions involved in
the dispute between monists and pluralists. But the metaphysical
question concerning “substance” is ruled out by our criterion as
spurious.</p>
<p>A similar treatment must be accorded to the controversy between
realists and idealists, in its metaphysical aspect. A simple
illustration, which I have made use of in a similar argument elsewhere,
37 will help to demonstrate this. Let us suppose that a picture is
discovered and the suggestion made that it was painted by Goya. There is
a definite procedure for dealing with such a question. The experts
examine the picture to see in what way it resembles the accredited works
of Goya, and to see if it bears any marks which are characteristic of a
forgery; they look up contemporary records for evidence of the existence
of such a picture, and so on. In the end, they may still disagree, but
each one knows what empirical evidence would go to confirm or discredit
his opinion. Suppose, now, that these men have studied philosophy, and
some of them proceed to maintain that this picture is a set of ideas in
the perceiver’s mind, or in God’s mind, others that it is objectively
real. What possible experience could any of them have which would be
relevant to the solution of this dispute one way or the other? In the
ordinary sense of the term “real,” in which it is opposed to “illusory,”
the reality of the picture is not in doubt. The disputants have
satisfied themselves that the picture is real, in this sense, by
obtaining a correlated series of sensations of sight and sensations of
touch. Is there any similar process by which they could discover whether
the picture was real, in the sense in which the term “real” is opposed
to “ideal”? Clearly there is none. But, if that is so, the problem is
fictitious according to our criterion. This does not mean that the
realist-idealist controversy may be dismissed without further ado. For
it can legitimately be regarded as a dispute concerning the analysis of
existential propositions, and so as involving a logical problem which,
as we shall see, can be definitively solved.38 What we have just shown
is that the question at issue between idealists and realists becomes
fictitious when, as is often the case, it is given a metaphysical
interpretation.</p>
<p>There is no need for us to give further examples of the operation of
our criterion of significance. For our object is merely to show that
philosophy, as a genuine branch of knowledge, must be distinguished from
metaphysics. We are not now concerned with the historical question how
much of what has traditionally passed for philosophy is actually
metaphysical. We shall, however, point out later on that the majority of
the “great philosophers” of the past were not essentially
metaphysicians, and thus reassure those who would otherwise be prevented
from adopting our criterion by considerations of piety.</p>
<p>As to the validity of the verification principle, in the form in
which we have stated it, a demonstration will be given in the course of
this book. For it will be shown that all propositions which have factual
content are empirical hypotheses; and that the function of an empirical
hypothesis is to provide a rule for the anticipation of experience.39
And this means that every empirical hypothesis must be relevant to some
actual, or possible, experience, so that a statement which is not
relevant to any experience is not an empirical hypothesis, and
accordingly has no factual content. But this is precisely what the
principle of verifiability asserts.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned here that the fact that the utterances of the
metaphysician are nonsensical does not follow simply from the fact that
they are devoid of factual content. It follows from that fact, together
with the fact that they are not a priori propositions. And in assuming
that they are not a priori propositions, we are once again anticipating
the conclusions of a later chapter in this book.2 For it will be shown
there that a priori propositions, which have always been attractive to
philosophers on account of their certainty, owe this certainty to the
fact that they are tautologies. We may accordingly define a metaphysical
sentence as a sentence which purports to express a genuine proposition,
but does, in fact, express neither a tautology nor an empirical
hypothesis. And as tautologies and empirical hypotheses form the entire
class of significant propositions, we are justified in concluding that
all metaphysical assertions are nonsensical. Our next task is to show
how they come to be made.</p>
<p>The use of the term “substance,” to which we have already referred,
provides us with a good example of the way in which metaphysics mostly
comes to be written. It happens to be the case that we cannot, in our
language, refer to the sensible properties of a thing without
introducing a word or phrase which appears to stand for the thing itself
as opposed to anything which may be said about it. And, as a result of
this, those who are infected by the primitive superstition that to every
name a single real entity must correspond assume that it is necessary to
distinguish logically between the thing itself and any, or all, of its
sensible properties. And so they employ the term “substance” to refer to
the thing itself. But from the fact that we happen to employ a single
word to refer to a thing, and make that word the grammatical subject of
the sentences in which we refer to the sensible appearances of the
thing, it does not by any means follow that the thing itself is a
“simple entity,” or that it cannot be defined in terms of the totality
of its appearances. It is true that in talking of “its” appearances we
appear to distinguish the thing from the appearances, but that is simply
an accident of linguistic usage. Logical analysis shows that what makes
these “appearances” the “appearances of” the same thing is not their
relationship to an entity other than themselves, but their relationship
to one another. The metaphysician fails to see this because he is misled
by a superficial grammatical feature of his language.</p>
<p>A simpler and clearer instance of the way in which a considertion of
grammar leads to metaphysics is the case of the metaphysical concept of
Being. The origin of our temptation to raise questions about Being,
which no conceivable experience would enable us to answer, lies in the
fact that, in our language, sentences which express existential
propositions and sentences which express attributive propositions may be
of the same grammatical form. For instance, the sentences “Martyrs
exist” and “Martyrs suffer” both consist of a noun followed by an
intransitive verb, and the fact that they have grammatically the same
appearance leads one to assume that they are of the same logical type.
It is seen that in the proposition “Martyrs suffer,” the members of a
certain species are credited with a certain attribute, and it is
sometimes assumed that the same thing is true of such a proposition as
“Martyrs exist.” If this were actually the case, it would, indeed, be as
legitimate to speculate about the Being of martyrs as it is to speculate
about their suffering. But, as Kant pointed out,40 existence is not an
attribute. For, when we ascribe an attribute to a thing, we covertly
assert that it exists: so that if existence were itself an attribute, it
would follow that all positive existential propositions were
tautologies, and all negative existential propositions
self-contradictory; and this is not the case.41 So that those who raise
questions about Being which are based on the assumption that existence
is an attribute are guilty of following grammar beyond the boundaries of
sense.</p>
<p>A similar mistake has been made in connection with such propositions
as “Unicorns are fictitious.” Here again the fact that there is a
superficial grammatical resemblance between the English sentences “Dogs
are faithful” and “Unicorns are fictitious,” and between the
corresponding sentences in other languages, creates the assumption that
they are of the same logical type. Dogs must exist in order to have the
property of being faithful, and so it is held that unless unicorns in
some way existed they could not have the property of being fictitious.
But, as it is plainly self-contradictory to say that fictitious objects
exist, the device is adopted of saying that they are real in some
non-empirical sense—that they have a mode of real being which is
different from the mode of being of existent things. But since there is
no way of testing whether an object is real in this sense, as there is
for testing whether it is real in the ordinary sense, the assertion that
fictitious objects have a special non-empirical mode of real being is
devoid of all literal significance. It comes to be made as a result of
the assumption that being fictitious is an attribute. And this is a
fallacy of the same order as the fallacy of supposing that existence is
an attribute, and it can be exposed in the same way.</p>
<p>In general, the postulation of real non-existent entities results
from the superstition, just now referred to, that, to every word or
phrase that can be the grammatical subject of a sentence, there must
somewhere be a real entity corresponding. For as there is no place in
the empirical world for many of these “entities,” a special
non-empirical world is invoked to house them. To this error must be
attributed, not only the utterances of a Heidegger, who bases his
metaphysics on the assumption that “Nothing” is a name which is used to
denote something peculiarly mysterious,42 but also the prevalence of
such problems as those concerning the reality of propositions and
universals whose senselessness, though less obvious, is no less
complete.</p>
<p>These few examples afford a sufficient indication of the way in which
most metaphysical assertions come to be formulated. They show how easy
it is to write sentences which are literally nonsensical without seeing
that they are nonsensical. And thus we see that the view that a number
of the traditional “problems of philosophy” are metaphysical, and
consequently fictitious, does not involve any incredible assumptions
about the psychology of philosophers.</p>
<p>Among those who recognise that if philosophy is to be accounted a
genuine branch of knowledge it must be defined in such a way as to
distinguish it from metaphysics, it is fashionable to speak of the
metaphysician as a kind of misplaced poet. As his statements have no
literal meaning, they are not subject to any criteria of truth or
falsehood: but they may still serve to express, or arouse, emotion, and
thus be subject to ethical or aesthetic standards. And it is suggested
that they may have considerable value, as means of moral inspiration, or
even as works of art. In this way, an attempt is made to compensate the
metaphysician for his extrusion from philosophy.43</p>
<p>I am afraid that this compensation is hardly in accordance with his
deserts. The view that the metaphysician is to be reckoned among the
poets appears to rest on the assumption that both talk nonsense. But
this assumption is false. In the vast majority of cases the sentences
which are produced by poets do have literal meaning. The difference
between the man who uses language scientifically and the man who uses it
emotively is not that the one produces sentences which are incapable of
arousing emotion, and the other sentences which have no sense, but that
the one is primarily concerned with the expression of true propositions,
the other with the creation of a work of art. Thus, if a work of science
contains true and important propositions, its value as a work of science
will hardly be diminished by the fact that they are inelegantly
expressed. And similarly, a work of art is not necessarily the worse for
the fact that all the propositions comprising it are literally false.
But to say that many literary works are largely composed of falsehoods,
is not to say that they are composed of pseudo-propositions. It is, in
fact, very rare for a literary artist to produce sentences which have no
literal meaning. And where this does occur, the sentences are carefully
chosen for their rhythm and balance. If the author writes nonsense, it
is because he considers it most suitable for bringing about the effects
for which his writing is designed.</p>
<p>The metaphysician, on the other hand, does not intend to write
nonsense. He lapses into it through being deceived by grammar, or
through committing errors of reasoning, such as that which leads to the
view that the sensible world is unreal. But it is not the mark of a poet
simply to make mistakes of this sort. There are some, indeed, who would
see in the fact that the metaphysician’s utterances are senseless a
reason against the view that they have æsthetic value. And, without
going so far as this, we may safely say that it does not constitute a
reason for it.</p>
<p>It is true, however, that although the greater part of metaphysics is
merely the embodiment of humdrum errors, there remain a number of
metaphysical passages which are the work of genuine mystical feeling;
and they may more plausibly be held to have moral or æsthetic value.
But, as far as we are concerned, the distinction between the kind of
metaphysics that is produced by a philosopher who has been duped by
grammar, and the kind that is produced by a mystic who is trying to
express the inexpressible, is of no great importance: what is important
to us is to realise that even the utterances of the metaphysician who is
attempting to expound a vision are literally senseless; so that
henceforth we may pursue our philosophical researches with as little
regard for them as for the more inglorious kind of metaphysics which
comes from a failure to understand the workings of our language.</p>
