<h4 id="chapter-ii-the-function-of-philosophy">CHAPTER II THE FUNCTION
OF PHILOSOPHY</h4>
<p>AMONG THE SUPERSTITIONS from which we are freed by the abandonment of
metaphysics is the view that it is the business of the philosopher to
construct a deductive system. In rejecting this view we are not, of
course, suggesting that the philosopher can dispense with deductive
reasoning. We are simply contesting his right to posit certain first
principles, and then offer them with their consequences as a complete
picture of reality. To discredit this procedure, one has only to show
that there can be no first principles of the kind it requires.</p>
<p>As it is the function of these first principles to provide a certain
basis for our knowledge, it is clear that they are not to be found among
the so-called laws of nature. For we shall see that the “laws of
nature,” if they are not mere definitions, are simply hypotheses which
may be confuted by experience. And, indeed, it has never been the
practice of the system-builders in philosophy to choose inductive
generalizations for their premises. Rightly regarding such
generalizations as being merely probable, they subordinate them to
principles which they believe to be logically certain.</p>
<p>This is illustrated most clearly in the system of Descartes. It is
commonly said that Descartes attempted to derive all human knowledge
from premises whose truth was intuitively certain: but this
interpretation puts an undue stress on the element of psychology in his
system. I think he realised well enough that a mere appeal to intuition
was insufficient for his purpose, since men are not all equally
credulous, and that what he was really trying to do was to base all our
knowledge on propositions which it would be self-contradictory to deny.
He thought he had found such a proposition in “cogito,” which must not
here be understood in its ordinary sense of “I think,” but rather as
meaning “there is a thought now.” In fact he was wrong, because “non
cogito” would be self-contradictory only if it negated itself: and this
no significant proposition can do. But even if it were true that such a
proposition as “there is a thought now” was logically certain, it still
would not serve Descartes’ purpose. For if “cogito” is taken in this
sense, his initial principle, “cogito ergo sum,” is false. “I exist”
does not follow from “there is a thought now.” The fact that a thought
occurs at a given moment does not entail that any other thought has
occurred at any other moment, still less that there has occurred a
series of thoughts sufficient to constitute a single self. As Hume
conclusively showed, no one event intrinsically points to any other. We
infer the existence of events which we are not actually observing, with
the help of general principles. But these principles must be obtained
inductively. By mere deduction from what is immediately given we cannot
advance a single step beyond. And, consequently, any attempt to base a
deductive system on propositions which describe what is immediately
given is bound to be a failure.</p>
<p>The only other course open to one who wished to deduce all our
knowledge from “first principles,” without indulging in metaphysics,
would be to take for his premises a set of a priori truths. But, as we
have already mentioned, and shall later show, an a priori truth is a
tautology. And from a set of tautologies, taken by themselves, only
further tautologies can be validly deduced. But it would be absurd to
put forward a system of tautologies as constituting the whole truth
about the universe. And thus we may conclude that it is not possible to
deduce all our knowledge from “first principles”; so that those who hold
that it is the function of philosophy to carry out such a deduction are
denying its claim to be a genuine branch of knowledge.</p>
<p>The belief that it is the business of the philosopher to search for
first principles is bound up with the familiar conception of philosophy
as the study of reality as a whole. And this conception is one which it
is difficult to criticize, because it is so vague. If it is taken to
imply, as it sometimes is, that the philosopher somehow projects himself
outside the world, and takes a bird’s-eye view of it, then it is plainly
a metaphysical conception. And it is also metaphysical to assert, as
some do, that “reality as a whole” is somehow generically different from
the reality which is investigated piecemeal by the special sciences. But
if the assertion that philosophy studies reality as a whole is
understood to imply merely that the philosopher is equally concerned
with the content of every science, then we may accept it, not indeed as
an adequate definition of philosophy, but as a truth about it. For we
shall find, when we come to discuss the relationship of philosophy to
science, that it is not, in principle, related to any one science more
closely than to any other.</p>
<p>In saying that philosophy is concerned with each of the sciences, in
a manner which we shall indicate,44 we mean also to rule out the
supposition that philosophy can be ranged alongside the existing
sciences, as a special department of speculative knowledge. Those who
make this supposition cherish the belief that there are some things in
the world which are possible objects of speculative knowledge and yet
lie beyond the scope of empirical science. But this belief is a
delusion. There is no field of experience which cannot, in principle, be
brought under some form of scientific law, and no type of speculative
knowledge about the world which it is, in principle, beyond the power of
science to give. We have already gone some way to substantiate this
proposition by demolishing metaphysics; and we shall justify it to the
full in the course of this book.</p>
<p>With this we complete the overthrow of speculative philosophy. We are
now in a position to see that the function of philosophy is wholly
critical. In what exactly does its critical activity consist?</p>
<p>One way of answering this question is to say that it is the
philosopher’s business to test the validity of our scientific hypotheses
and everyday assumptions. But this view, though very widely held, is
mistaken. If a man chooses to doubt the truth of all the propositions he
ordinarily believes, it is not in the power of philosophy to reassure
him. The most that philosophy can do, apart from seeing whether his
beliefs are self-consistent, is to show what are the criteria which are
used to determine the truth or falsehood of any given proposition: and
then, when the sceptic realises that certain observations would verify
his propositions, he may also realize that he could make those
observations, and so consider his original beliefs to be justified. But
in such a case one cannot say that it is philosophy which justifies his
beliefs. Philosophy merely shows him that experience can justify them.
We may look to the philosopher to show us what we accept as constituting
sufficient evidence for the truth of any given empirical proposition.
But whether the evidence is forthcoming or not is in every case a purely
empirical question.</p>
<p>If anyone thinks that we are here taking too much for granted, let
him refer to the chapter on “Truth and Probability,” in which we discuss
how the validity of synthetic propositions is determined. He will see
there that the only sort of justification that is necessary or possible
for self-consistent empirical propositions is empirical verification.
And this applies just as much to the laws of science as to the maxims of
common sense. Indeed there is no difference in kind between them. The
superiority of the scientific hypothesis consists merely in its being
more abstract, more precise, and more fruitful. And although scientific
objects such as atoms and electrons seem to be fictitious in a way that
chairs and tables are not, here, too, the distinction is only a
distinction of degree. For both these kinds of objects are known only by
their sensible manifestations and are definable in terms of them.</p>
<p>It is time, therefore, to abandon the superstition that natural
science cannot be regarded as logically respectable until philosophers
have solved the problem of induction. The problem of induction is,
roughly speaking, the problem of finding a way to prove that certain
empirical generalizations which are derived from past experience will
hold good also in the future. There are only two ways of approaching
this problem on the assumption that it is a genuine problem, and it is
easy to see that neither of them can lead to its solution. One may
attempt to deduce the proposition which one is required to prove either
from a purely formal principle or from an empirical principle. In the
former case one commits the error of supposing that from a tautology it
is possible to deduce a proposition about a matter of fact; in the
latter case one simply assumes what one is setting out to prove. For
example, it is often said that we can justify induction by invoking the
uniformity of nature, or by postulating a “principle of limited
independent variety.”45 But, in fact, the principle of the uniformity of
nature merely states, in a misleading fashion, the assumption that past
experience is a reliable guide to the future; while the principle of
limited independent variety presupposes it. And it is plain that any
other empirical principle which was put forward as a justification of
induction would beg the question in the same way. For the only grounds
which one could have for believing such a principle would be inductive
grounds.</p>
<p>Thus it appears that there is no possible way of solving the problem
of induction, as it is ordinarily conceived. And this means that it is a
fictitious problem, since all genuine problems are at least
theoretically capable of being solved: and the credit of natural science
is not impaired by the fact that some philosophers continue to be
puzzled by it. Actually, we shall see that the only test to which a form
of scientific procedure which satisfies the necessary condition of
self-consistency is subject, is the test of its success in practice. We
are entitled to have faith in our procedure just so long as it does the
work which it is designed to do—that is, enables us to predict future
experience, and so to control our environment. Of course, the fact that
a certain form of procedure has always been successful in practice
affords no logical guarantee that it will continue to be so. But then it
is a mistake to demand a guarantee where it is logically impossible to
obtain one. This does not mean that it is irrational to expect future
experience to conform to the past. For when we come to define
“rationality” we shall find that for us “being rational” entails being
guided in a particular fashion by past experience.</p>
<p>The task of defining rationality is precisely the sort of task that
it is the business of philosophy to undertake. But in achieving this it
does not justify scientific procedure. What justifies scientific
procedure, to the extent to which it is capable of being justified, is
the success of the predictions to which it gives rise: and this can be
determined only in actual experience. By itself, the analysis of a
synthetic principle tells us nothing whatsoever about its truth.</p>
<p>Unhappily, this fact is generally disregarded by philosophers who
concern themselves with the so-called theory of knowledge. Thus it is
common for writers on the subject of perception to assume that, unless
one can give a satisfactory analysis of perceptual situations, one is
not entitled to believe in the existence of material things. But this is
a complete mistake. What gives one the right to believe in the existence
of a certain material thing is simply the fact that one has certain
sensations: for, whether one realises it or not, to say that the thing
exists is equivalent to saying that such sensations are obtainable. It
is the philosopher’s business to give a correct definition of material
things in terms of sensations. But his success or failure in this task
has no bearing whatsoever on the validity of our perceptual judgements.
That depends wholly on actual sense-experience.</p>
<p>It follows that the philosopher has no right to despise the beliefs
of common sense. If he does so, he merely displays his ignorance of the
true purpose of his enquiries. What he is entitled to despise is the
unreflecting analysis of those beliefs, which takes the grammatical
structure of the sentence as a trustworthy guide to its meaning. Thus,
many of the mistakes made in connection with the problem of perception
can be accounted for by the fact, already referred to in connection with
the metaphysical notion of “substance,” that it happens to be impossible
in an ordinary European language to mention a thing without appearing to
distinguish it generically from its qualities and states. But from the
fact that the common-sense analysis of a proposition is mistaken it by
no means follows that the proposition is not true. The philosopher may
be able to show us that the propositions we believe are far more complex
than we suppose; but it does not follow from this that we have no right
to believe them.</p>
<p>It should now be sufficiently clear that if the philosopher is to
uphold his claim to make a special contribution to the stock of our
knowledge, he must not attempt to formulate speculative truths, or to
look for first principles, or to make a priori judgements about the
validity of our empirical beliefs. He must, in fact, confine himself to
works of clarification and analysis of a sort which we shall presently
describe.</p>
<p>In saying that the activity of philosophising is essentially
analytic, we are not, of course, maintaining that all those who are
commonly called philosophers have actually been engaged in carrying out
analyses. On the contrary, we have been at pains to show that a great
deal of what is commonly called philosophy is metaphysical in character.
What we have been in search of, in enquiring into the function of
philosophy, is a definition of philosophy which should accord to some
extent with the practice of those who are commonly called philosophers,
and at the same time be consistent with the common assumption that
philosophy is a special branch of knowledge. It is because metaphysics
fails to satisfy this second condition that we distinguish it from
philosophy, in spite of the fact that it is commonly referred to as
philosophy. And our justification for making this distinction is that it
is necessitated by our original postulate that philosophy is a special
branch of knowledge, and our demonstration that metaphysics is not.</p>
<p>Although this procedure is logically unassailable, it will perhaps be
attacked on the ground that it is inexpedient. It will be said that the
“history of philosophy” is, almost entirely, a history of metaphysics;
and, consequently, that although there is no actual fallacy involved in
our using the word “philosophy” in the sense in which philosophy is
incompatible with metaphysics, it is dangerously misleading. For all our
care in defining the term will not prevent people from confusing the
activities which we call philosophical with the metaphysical activities
of those whom they have been taught to regard as philosophers. And
therefore it would surely be advisable for us to abandon the term
“philosophy” altogether, as a name for a distinctive branch of
knowledge, and invent some new description for the activity which we
were minded to call the activity of philosophizing.</p>
<p>Our answer to this is that it is not the case that the “history of
philosophy” is almost entirely a history of metaphysics. That it
contains some metaphysics is undeniable. But I think it can be shown
that the majority of those who are commonly supposed to have been great
philosophers were primarily not metaphysicians but analysts. For
example, I do not see how anyone who follows the account which we shall
give of the nature of philosophical analysis and then turns to Locke’s
Essay Concerning Human Understranding can fail to conclude that it is
essentially an analytic work. Locke is generally regarded as being one
who, like G. E. Moore at the present time, puts forward a philosophy of
common sense.46 But he does not, any more than Moore, attempt to give an
a priori justification of our common-sense beliefs. Rather does he
appear to have seen that it was not his business as a philosopher to
affirm or deny the validity of any empirical propositions, but only to
analyse them. For he is content, in his own words, “to be employed as an
under-labourer in clearing the ground a little, and removing some of the
rubbish that lies in the way of knowledge”; and so devotes himself to
the purely analytic tasks of defining knowledge, and classifying
propositions, and displaying the nature of material things. And the
small portion of his work which is not philosophical, in our sense, is
not given over to metaphysics, but to psychology.</p>
<p>Nor is it fair to regard Berkeley as a metaphysician. For he did not,
in fact, deny the reality of material things, as we are still too
commonly told. What he denied was the adequacy of Locke’s analysis of
the notion of a material thing. He maintained that to say of various
“ideas of sensation” that they belonged to a single material thing was
not, as Locke thought, to say that they were related to a single
unobservable underlying “somewhat,” but rather that they stood in
certain relations to one another. And in this he was right. Admittedly
he made the mistake of supposing that what was immediately given in
sensation was necessarily mental; and the use, by him and by Locke, of
the word “idea” to denote an element in that which is sensibly given is
objectionable, because it suggests this false view. Accordingly we
replace the word “idea” in this usage by the neutral word
“sense-content,” which we shall use to refer to the immediate data not
merely of “outer” but also of “introspective” sensation, and say that
what Berkeley discovered was that material things must be definable in
terms of sense-contents. We shall see, when we come finally to settle
the conflict between idealism and realism, that his actual conception of
the relationship between material things and sense-contents was not
altogether accurate. It led him to some notoriously paradoxical
conclusions, which a slight emendation will enable us to avoid. But the
fact that he failed to give a completely correct account of the way in
which material things are constituted out of sense-contents does not
invalidate his contention that they are so constituted. On the contrary,
we know that it must be possible to define material things in terms of
sense-contents, because it is only by the occurrence of certain
sense-contents that the existence of any material thing can ever be in
the least degree verified. And thus we see that we have not to enquire
whether a phenomenalist “theory of perception” or some other sort of
theory is correct, but only what form of phenomenalist theory is
correct. For the fact that all causal and representative theories of
perception treat material things as if they were unobservable entities
entitles us, as Berkeley saw, to rule them out a priori. The unfortunate
thing is that, in spite of this, he found it necessary to postulate God
as an unobservable cause of our “ideas”; and he must be criticised also
for failing to see that the argument which he uses to dispose of Locke’s
analysis of a material thing is fatal to his own conception of the
nature of the self, a point which was effectively seized upon by
Hume.</p>
<p>Of Hume we may say not merely that he was not in practice a
metaphysician, but that he explicitly rejected metaphysics. We find the
strongest evidence of this in the passage with which he concludes his
Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. “If,” he says, “we take in our
hand any volume; of divinity, or school metaphysics, for instance; let
us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or
number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter
of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames. For it can
contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.” What is this but a
rhetorical version of our own thesis that a sentence which does not
express either a formally true proposition or an empirical hypothesis is
devoid of literal significance? It is true that Hume does not, so far as
I know, actually put forward any view concerning the nature of
philosophical propositions themselves, but those of his works which are
commonly accounted philosophical are, apart from certain passages which
deal with questions of psychology, works of analysis. If this is not
universally conceded, it is because his treatment of causation, which is
the main feature of his philosophical work, is often misinterpreted. He
has been accused of denying causation, whereas in fact he was concerned
only with defining it. So far is he from asserting that no causal
propositions are true that he is himself at pains to give rules for
judging of the existence of causes and effects 47 He realised well
enough that the question whether a given causal proposition was true or
false was not one that could be settled a priori, and accordingly
confined himself to discussing the analytic question, What is it that we
are asserting when we assert that one event is causally connected with
another? And in answering this question he showed, I think conclusively,
first that the relation of cause and effect was not logical in
character, since any proposition asserting a causal connection could be
denied without self-contradiction, secondly that causal laws were not
analytically derived from experience, since they were not deducible from
any finite number of experiential propositions, and, thirdly, that it
was a mistake to analyse propositions asserting causal connections in
terms of a relation of necessitation which held between particular
events, since it was impossible to conceive of any observations which
would have the slightest tendency to establish the existence of such a
relation. He thus laid the way open for the view, which we adopt, that
every assertion of a particular causal connection involves the assertion
of a causal law, and that every general proposition of the form “C
causes E” is equivalent to a proposition of the form “whenever C, then
E,” where the symbol “whenever” must be taken to refer, not to a finite
number of actual instances of C, but to the infinite number of possible
instances. He himself defines a cause as “an object, followed by
another, and where all the objects similar to the first are followed by
objects similar to the second,” or, alternatively, as “an object
followed by another, and whose appearance always conveys the thought to
that other”;48 but neither of these definitions is acceptable as it
stands. For, even if it is true that we should not, according to our
standards of rationality, have good reason to believe that an event C
was the cause of an event E unless we had observed a constant
conjunction of events like C with events like E, still there is no
self-contradiction involved in asserting the proposition “C is the cause
of E” and at the same time denying that any events like C or like E ever
have been observed; and this would be self-contradictory if the first of
the definitions quoted was correct. Nor is it inconceivable, as the
second definition implies, that there should be causal laws which have
never yet been thought of. But although we are obliged, for these
reasons, to reject Hume’s actual definitions of a cause, our view of the
nature of causation remains substantially the same as his. And we agree
with him that there can be no other justification for inductive
reasoning than its success in practice, while insisting more strongly
than he did that no better justification is required. For it is his
failure to make this second point clear that has given his views the air
of paradox which has caused them to be so much undervalued and
misunderstood.</p>
<p>When we consider, also, that Hobbes and Bentham were chiefly occupied
in giving definitions, and that the best part of John Stuart Mill’s work
consists in a development of the analyses carried out by Hume, we may
fairly claim that in holding that the activity of philosophising is
essentially analytic we are adopting a standpoint which has always been
implicit in English empiricism. Not that the practice of philosophical
analysis has been confined to members of this school. But it is with
them that we have the closest historical affinity.</p>
<p>If I refrain from discussing these questions in detail, and make no
attempt to furnish a complete list of all the “great philosophers” whose
work is predominantly analytic—a list which would certainly include
Plato and Aristotle and Kant—it is because the point to which this
discussion is relevant is one of minor importance in our enquiry. We
have been maintaining that much of “traditional philosophy” is genuinely
philosophical, by our standards, in order to defend ourselves against
the charge that our retention of the word “philosophy” is misleading.
But even if it were the case that none of those who are commonly called
philosophers had ever been engaged in what we call the activity of
philosophising, it would not follow that our definition of philosophy
was erroneous, given our initial postulates. We may admit that our
retention of the word “philosophy” is causally dependent on our belief
in the historical propositions set forth above. But the validity of
these historical propositions has no logical bearing on the validity of
our definition of philosophy, nor on the validity of the distinction
between philosophy, in our sense, and metaphysics.</p>
<p>It is advisable to stress the point that philosophy, as we understand
it, is wholly independent of metaphysics, inasmuch as the analytic
method is commonly supposed by its critics to have a metaphysical basis.
Being misled by the associations of the word “analysis,” they assume
that philosophical analysis is an activity of dissection; that it
consists in “breaking up” objects into their constituent parts, until
the whole universe is ultimately exhibited as an aggregate of “bare
particulars,” united by external relations. If this were really so, the
most effective way of attacking the method would be to show that its
basic presupposition was nonsensical. For to say that the universe was
an aggregate of bare particulars would be as senseless as to say that it
was Fire or Water or Experience. It is plain that no possible
observation would enable one to verify such an assertion. But, so far as
I know, this line of criticism is in fact never adopted. The critics
content themselves with pointing out that few, if any, of the complex
objects in the world are simply the sum of their parts. They have a
structure, an organic unity, which distinguishes them, as genuine
wholes, from mere aggregates. But the analyst, so it is said, is obliged
by his atomistic metaphysics to regard an object consisting of parts a,
b, c, and d in a distinctive configuration as being simply a+b+c+d, and
thus gives an entirely false account of its nature.</p>
<p>If we follow the Gestalt psychologists, who of all men talk most
constantly about genuine wholes, in defining such a whole as one in
which the properties of every part depend to some extent on its position
in the whole, then we may accept it as an empirical fact that there
exist genuine, or organic, wholes. And if the analytic method involved a
denial of this fact, it would indeed be a faulty method. But, actually,
the validity of the analytic method is not dependent on any empirical,
much less any metaphysical, presupposition about the nature of things.
For the philosopher, as an analyst, is not directly concerned with the
physical properties of things. He is concerned only with the way in
which we speak about them.</p>
<p>In other words, the propositions of philosophy are not factual, but
linguistic in character—that is, they do not describe the behaviour of
physical, or even mental, objects; they express definitions, or the
formal consequences of definitions. Accordingly, we may say that
philosophy is a department of logic. For we shall see that the
characteristic mark of a purely logical enquiry is that it is concerned
with the formal consequences of our definitions and not with questions
of empirical fact.</p>
<p>It follows that philosophy does not in any way compete with science.
The difference in type between philosophical and scientific propositions
is such that they cannot conceivably contradict one another. And this
makes it clear that the possibility of philosophical analysis is
independent of any empirical assumptions. That it is independent of any
metaphysical assumptions should be even more obvious still. For it is
absurd to suppose that the provision of definitions, and the study of
their formal consequences, involves the nonsensical assertion that the
world is composed of bare particulars, or any other metaphysical
dogma.</p>
<p>What has contributed as much as anything to the prevalent
misunderstanding of the nature of philosophical analysis is the fact
that propositions and questions which are really linguistic are often
expressed in such a way that they appear to be factual.49 A striking
instance of this is provided by the proposition that a material thing
cannot be in two places at once. This looks like an empirical
proposition, and is constantly invoked by those who desire to prove that
it is possible for an empirical proposition to be logically certain. But
a more critical inspection shows that it is not empirical at all, but
linguistic. It simply records the fact that, as the result of certain
verbal conventions, the proposition that two sense-contents occur in the
same visual or tactual sense-field is incompatible with the proposition
that they belong to the same material thing.50 And this is indeed a
necessary fact. But it has not the least tendency to show that we have
certain knowledge about the empirical properties of objects. For it is
necessary only because we happen to use the relevant words in a
particular way. There is no logical reason why we should not so alter
our definitions that the sentence “A thing cannot be in two places at
once” comes to express a self-contradiction instead of a necessary
truth.</p>
<p>Another good example of linguistically necessary proposition which
appears to be a record of empirical fact is the proposition, “Relations
are not particulars, but universals.” One might suppose that this was a
proposition of the same order as, “Armenians are not Mohammedans, but
Christians”: but one would be mistaken. For, whereas the latter
proposition is an empirical hypothesis relating to the religious
practices of a certain group of people, the former is not a proposition
about “things” at all, but simply about words. It records the fact that
relation-symbols belong by definition to the class of symbols for
characters, and not to the class of symbols for things.</p>
<p>The assertion that relations are universals provokes the question,
“What is a universal?”; and this question is not, as it has
traditionally been regarded, a question about the character of certain
real objects, but a request for a definition of a certain term.
Philosophy, as it is written, is full of questions like this, which seem
to be factual but are not. Thus, to ask what is the nature of a material
object is to ask for a definition of “material object,” and this, as we
shall shortly see, is to ask how propositions about material objects are
to be translated into propositions about sense-contents. Similarly, to
ask what is a number is to ask some such question as whether it is
possible to translate propositions about the natural numbers into
propositions about classes. 51 And the same thing applies to all the
other philosophical questions of the form, “What is an x?” or, “What is
the nature of x?” They are all requests for definitions, and, as we
shall see, for definitions of a peculiar sort.</p>
<p>Although it is misleading to write about linguistic questions in
“factual” language, it is often convenient for the sake of brevity. And
we shall not always avoid doing it ourselves. But it is important that
no one should be deceived by this practice into supposing that the
philosopher is engaged on an empirical or a metaphysical enquiry. We may
speak loosely of him as analysing facts, or notions, or even things. But
we must make it clear that these are simply ways of saying that he is
concerned with the definition of the corresponding words.</p>
