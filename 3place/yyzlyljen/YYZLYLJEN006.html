<h4 id="chapter-iv-the-a-priori">CHAPTER IV THE A PRIORI</h4>
<p>THE VIEW OF PHILOSOPHY which we have adopted may, I think, fairly be
described as a form of empiricism. For it is characteristic of an
empiricist to eschew metaphysics, on the ground that every factual
proposition must refer to sense-experience. And even if the conception
of philosophizing as an activity of analysis is not to be discovered in
the traditional theories of empiricists, we have seen that it is
implicit in their practice. At the same time, it must be made clear
that, in calling ourselves empiricists, we are not avowing a belief in
any of the psychological doctrines which are commonly associated with
empiricism. For, even if these doctrines were valid, their validity
would be independent of the validity of any philosophical thesis. It
could be established only by observation, and not by the purely logical
considerations upon which our empiricism rests.</p>
<p>Having admitted that we are empiricists, we must now deal with the
objection that is commonly brought against all forms of empiricism; the
objection, namely, that it is impossible on empiricist principles to
account for our knowledge of necessary truths. For, as Hume conclusively
showed, no general proposition whose validity is subject to the test of
actual experience can ever be logically certain. No matter how often it
is verified in practice, there still remains the possibility that it
will be confuted on some future occasion. The fact that a law has been
substantiated in n—1 case affords no logical guarantee that it will be
substantiated in the nth case also, no matter how large we take n to be.
And this means that no general proposition referring to a matter of fact
can ever be shown to be necessarily and universally true. It can at best
be a probable hypothesis. And this, we shall find, applies not only to
general propositions, but to all propositions which have a factual
content. They can none of them ever become logically certain. This
conclusion, which we shall elaborate later on, is one which must be
accepted by every consistent empiricist. It is often thought to involve
him in complete scepticism; but this is not the case. For the fact that
the validity of a proposition cannot be logically guaranteed in no way
entails that it is irrational for us to believe it. On the contrary,
what is irrational is to look for a guarantee where none can be
forthcoming; to demand certainty where probability is all that is
obtainable. We have already remarked upon this, in referring to the work
of Hume. And we shall make the point clearer when we come to treat of
probability, in explaining the use which we make of empirical
propositions. We shall discover that there is nothing perverse or
paradoxical about the view that all the “truths” of science and common
sense are hypotheses; and consequently that the fact that it involves
this view constitutes no objection to the empiricist thesis.</p>
<p>Where the empiricist does encounter difficulty is in connection with
the truths of formal logic and mathematics. For whereas a scientific
generalisation is readily admitted to be fallible, the truths of
mathematics and logic appear to everyone to be necessary and certain.
But if empiricism is correct no proposition which has a factual content
can be necessary or certain. Accordingly the empiricist must deal with
the truths of logic and mathematics in one of the two following ways: he
must say either that they are not necessary truths, in which case he
must account for the universal conviction that they are; or he must say
that they have no factual content, and then he must explain how a
proposition which is empty of all factual content can be true and useful
and surprising.</p>
<p>If neither of these courses proves satisfactory, we shall be obliged
to give way to rationalism. We shall be obliged to admit that there are
some truths about the world which we can know independently of
experience; that there are some properties which we can ascribe to all
objects, even though we cannot conceivably observe that all objects have
them. And we shall have to accept it as a mysterious inexplicable fact
that our thought has this power to reveal to us authoritatively the
nature of objects which we have never observed. Or else we must accept
the Kantian explanation which, apart from the epistemological
difficulties which we have already touched on, only pushes the mystery a
stage further back.</p>
<p>It is clear that any such concession to rationalism would upset the
main argument of this book. For the admission that there were some facts
about the world which could be known independently of experience would
be incompatible with our fundamental contention that a sentence says
nothing unless it is empirically verifiable. And thus the whole force of
our attack on metaphysics would be destroyed. It is vital, therefore,
for us to be able to show that one or other of the empiricist accounts
of the propositions of logic and mathematics is correct. If we are
successful in this, we shall have destroyed the foundations of
rationalism. For the fundamental tenet of rationalism is that thought is
an independent source of knowledge, and is moreover a more trustworthy
source of knowledge than experience; indeed some rationalists have gone
so far as to say that thought is the only source of knowledge. And the
ground for this view is simply that the only necessary truths about the
world which are known to us are known through thought and not through
experience. So that if we can show either that the truths in question
are not necessary or that they are not “truths about the world,” we
shall be taking away the support on which rationalism rests. We shall be
making good the empiricist contention that there are no “truths of
reason” which refer to matters of fact.</p>
<p>The course of maintaining that the truths of logic and mathematics
are not necessary or certain was adopted by Mill. He maintained that
these propositions were inductive generalizations based on an extremely
large number of instances. The fact that the number of supporting
instances was so very large accounted, in his view, for our believing
these generalizations to be necessarily and universally true. The
evidence in their favour was so strong that it seemed incredible to us
that a contrary instance should ever arise. Nevertheless it was in
principle possible for such generalizations to be confuted. They were
highly probable, but, being inductive generalizations, they were not
certain. The difference between them and the hypotheses of natural
science was a difference in degree and not in kind. Experience gave us
very good reason to suppose that a “truth” of mathematics or logic was
true universally; but we were not possessed of a guarantee. For these
“truths” were only empirical hypotheses which had worked particularly
well in the past; and, like all empirical hypotheses, they were
theoretically fallible.</p>
<p>I do not think that this solution of the empiricist’s difficulty with
regard to the propositions of logic and mathematics is acceptable. In
discussing it, it is necessary to make a distinction which is perhaps
already enshrined in Kant’s famous dictum that, although there can be no
doubt that all our knowledge begins with experience, it does not follow
that it all arises out of experience. 64 When we say that the truths of
logic are known independently of experience, we are not of course saying
that they are innate, in the sense that we are born knowing them. It is
obvious that mathematics and logic have to be learned in the same way as
chemistry and history have to be learned. Nor are we denying that the
first person to discover a given logical or mathematical truth was led
to it by an inductive procedure. It is very probable, for example, that
the principle of the syllogism was formulated not before but after the
validity of syllogistic reasoning had been observed in a number of
particular cases. What we are discussing, however, when we say that
logical and mathematical truths are known independently of experience,
is not a historical question concerning the way in which these truths
were originally discovered, nor a psychological question concerning the
way in which each of us comes to learn them, but an epistemological
question. The contention of Mill’s which we reject is that the
propositions of logic and mathematics have the same status as empirical
hypotheses; that their validity is determined in the same way. We
maintain that they are independent of experience in the sense that they
do not owe their validity to empirical verification. We may come to
discover them through an inductive process; but once we have apprehended
them we see that they are necessarily true, that they hold good for
every conceivable instance. And this serves to distinguish them from
empirical generalizations. For we know that a proposition whose validity
depends upon experience cannot be seen to be necessarily and universally
true.</p>
<p>In rejecting Mill’s theory, we are obliged to be somewhat dogmatic.
We can do no more than state the issue clearly and then trust that his
contention will be seen to be discrepant with the relevant logical
facts. The following considerations may serve to show that of the two
ways of dealing with logic and mathematics which are open to the
empiricist, the one which Mill adopted is not the one which is
correct.</p>
<p>The best way to substantiate our assertion that the truths of formal
logic and pure mathematics are necessarily true is to examine cases in
which they might seem to be confuted. It might easily happen, for
example, that when I came to count what I had taken to be five pairs of
objects, I found that they amounted only to nine. And if I wished to
mislead people I might say that on this occasion twice five was not ten.
But in that case I should not be using the complex sign “2 X 5 = 10” in
the way in which it is ordinarily used. I should be taking it not as the
expression of a purely mathematical proposition, but as the expression
of an empirical generalization, to the effect that whenever I counted
what appeared to me to be five pairs of objects I discovered that they
were ten in number. This generalization may very well be false. But if
it proved false in a given case, one would not say that the mathematical
proposition ”2 × 5 = 10” had been confuted. One would say that I was
wrong in supposing that there were five pairs of objects to start with,
or that one of the objects had been taken away while I was counting, or
that two of them had coalesced, or that I had counted wrongly. One would
adopt as an explanation whatever empirical hypothesis fitted in best
with the accredited facts. The one explanation which would in no
circumstances be adopted is that ten is not always the product of two
and five.</p>
<p>To take another example: if what appears to be a Euclidean triangle
is found by measurement not to have angles totalling 180 degrees, we do
not say that we have met with an instance which invalidates the
mathematical proposition that the sum of the three angles of a Euclidean
triangle is 180 degrees. We say that we have measured wrongly, or, more
probably, that the triangle we have been measuring is not Euclidean. And
this is our procedure in every case in which a mathematical truth might
appear to be confuted. We always preserve its validity by adopting some
other explanation of the occurrence.</p>
<p>The same thing applies to the principles of formal logic. We may take
an example relating to the so-called law of excluded middle, which
states that a proposition must be either true or false, or, in other
words, that it is impossible that a proposition and its contradictory
should neither of them be true. One might suppose that a proposition of
the form “x has stopped doing y” would in certain cases constitute an
exception to this law. For instance, if my friend has never yet written
to me, it seems fair to say that it is neither true nor false that he
has stopped writing to me. But in fact one would refuse to accept such
an instance as an invalidation of the law of excluded middle. One would
point out that the proposition “My friend has stopped writing to me” is
not a simple proposition, but the conjunction of the two propositions
“My friend wrote to me in the past” and “My friend does not write to me
now”: and, furthermore, that the proposition “My friend has not stopped
writing to me” is not, as it appears to be, contradictory to “My friend
has stopped writing to me,” but only contrary to it. For it means “My
friend wrote to me in the past, and he still writes to me.” When,
therefore, we say that such a proposition as “My friend has stopped
writing to me” is sometimes neither true nor false, we are speaking
inaccurately. For we seem to be saying that neither it nor its
contradictory is true. Whereas what we mean, or anyhow should mean, is
that neither it nor its apparent contradictory is true. And its apparent
contradictory is really only its contrary. Thus we preserve the law of
excluded middle by showing that the negating of a sentence does not
always yield the contradictory of the proposition originally
expressed.</p>
<p>There is no need to give further examples. Whatever instance we care
to take, we shall always find that the situations in which a logical or
mathematical principle might appear to be confuted are accounted for in
such a way as to leave the principle unassailed. And this indicates that
Mill was wrong in supposing that a situation could arise which would
overthrow a mathematical truth. The principles of logic and mathematics
are true universally simply because we never allow them to be anything
else. And the reason for this is that we cannot abandon them without
contradicting ourselves, without sinning against the rules which govern
the use of language, and so making our utterances self stultifying. In
other words, the truths of logic and mathematics are analytic
propositions or tautologies. In saying this we are making what will be
held to be an extremely controversial statement, and we must now proceed
to make its implications clear.</p>
<p>The most familiar definition of an analytic proposition, or
judgement, as he called it, is that given by Kant. He said65 that an
analytic judgement was one in which the predicate B belonged to the
subject A as something which was covertly contained in the concept of A.
He contrasted analytic with synthetic judgements, in which the predicate
B lay outside the subject A, although it did stand in connection with
it. Analytic judgements, he explains, “add nothing through the predicate
to the concept of the subject, but merely break it up into those
constituent concepts that have all along been thought in it, although
confusedly.” Synthetic judgements, on the other hand, “add to the
concept of the subject a predicate which has not been in any wise
thought in it, and which no analysis could possibly extract from it.”
Kant gives “all bodies are extended” as an example of an analytic
judgement, on the ground that the required predicate can be extracted
from the concept of “body,” “in accordance with the principle of
contradiction”; as an example of a synthetic judgement, he gives “all
bodies are heavy.” He refers also to “7 + 5 = 12” as a synthetic
judgement, on the ground that the concept of twelve is by no means
already thought in merely thinking the union of seven and five. And he
appears to regard this as tantamount to saying that the judgement does
not rest on the principle of contradiction alone. He holds, also, that
through analytic judgements our knowledge is not extended as it is
through synthetic judgements. For in analytic judgements “the concept
which I already have is merely set forth and made intelligible to
me.”</p>
<p>I think that this is a fair summary of Kant’s account of the
distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions, but I do not
think that it succeeds in making the distinction clear. For even if we
pass over the difficulties which arise out of the use of the vague term
“concept,” and the unwarranted assumption that every judgement, as well
as every German or English sentence, can be said to have a subject and a
predicate, there remains still this crucial defect. Kant does not give
one straightforward criterion for distinguishing between analytic and
synthetic propositions; he gives two distinct criteria, which are by no
means equivalent. Thus his ground for holding that the proposition “7 +
5 = 12” is synthetic is, as we have seen, that the subjective intension
of “7+5” does not comprise the subjective intension of “12”; whereas his
ground for holding that “all bodies are extended” is an analytic
proposition is that it rests on the principle of contradiction alone.
That is, he employs a psychological criterion in the first of these
examples, and a logical criterion in the second, and takes their
equivalence for granted, But, in fact, a proposition which is synthetic
according to the former criterion may very well be analytic according to
the latter. For, as we have already pointed out, it is possible for
symbols to be synonymous without having the same intensional meaning for
anyone: and accordingly from the fact that one can think of the sum of
seven and five without necessarily thinking of twelve, it by no means
follows that the proposition ”7+5 = 12” can be denied without
self-contradiction. From the rest of his argument, it is clear that it
is this logical proposition, and not any psychological proposition, that
Kant is really anxious to establish. His use of the psychological
criterion leads him to think that he has established it, when he has
not.</p>
<p>I think that we can preserve the logical import of Kant’s distinction
between analytic and synthetic propositions, while avoiding the
confusions which mar his actual account of it, if we say that a
proposition is analytic when its validity depends solely on the
definitions of the symbols it contains, and synthetic when its validity
is determined by the facts of experience. Thus, the proposition “There
are ants which have established a system of slavery” is a synthetic
proposition. For we cannot tell whether it is true or false merely by
considering the definitions of the symbols which constitute it. We have
to resort to actual observation of the behaviour of ants. On the other
hand, the proposition “Either some ants are parasitic or none are” is an
analytic proposition. For one need not resort to observation to discover
that there either are or are not ants which are parasitic. If one knows
what is the function of the words “either,” “or,” and “not,” then one
can see that any proposition of the form “Either p is true or p is not
true” is valid, independently of experience. Accordingly, all such
propositions are analytic.</p>
<p>It is to be noticed that the proposition “Either some ants are
parasitic or none are” provides no information whatsoever about the
behaviour of ants, or, indeed, about any matter of fact. And this
applies to all analytic propositions. They none of them provide any
information about any matter of fact. In other words, they are entirely
devoid of factual content. And it is for this reason that no experience
can confute them.</p>
<p>When we say that analytic propositions are devoid of factual content,
and consequently that they say nothing, we are not suggesting that they
are senseless in the way that metaphysical utterances are senseless.
For, although they give us no information about any empirical situation,
they do enlighten us by illustrating the way in which we use certain
symbols. Thus if I say, “Nothing can be coloured in different ways at
the same time with respect to the same part of itself,” I am not saying
anything about the properties of any actual thing; but I am not talking
nonsense. I am expressing an analytic proposition, which records our
determination to call a colour expanse which differs in quality from a
neighbouring colour expanse a different part of a given thing. In other
words, I am simply calling attention to the implications of a certain
linguistic usage. Similarly, in saying that if all Bretons are
Frenchmen, and all Frenchmen Europeans, then all Bretons are Europeans,
I am not describing any matter of fact. But I am showing that in the
statement that all Bretons are Frenchmen, and all Frenchmen Europeans,
the further statement that all Bretons are Europeans is implicitly
contained. And I am thereby indicating the convention which governs our
usage of the words “if” and “all.”</p>
<p>We see, then, that there is a sense in which analytic propositions do
give us new knowledge. They call attention to linguistic usages, of
which we might otherwise not be conscious, and they reveal unsuspected
implications in our assertions and beliefs. But we can see also that
there is a sense in which they may be said to add nothing to our
knowledge. For they tell us only what we may be said to know already.
Thus, if I know that the existence of May Queens is a relic of
tree-worship, and I discover that May Queens still exist in England, I
can employ the tautology “If p implies q, and p is true, q is true” to
show that there still exists a relic of tree-worship in England. But in
saying that there are still May Queens in England, and that the
existence of May Queens is a relic of tree-worship, I have already
asserted the existence in England of a relic of tree-worship. The use of
the tautology does, indeed, enable me to make this concealed assertion
explicit. But it does not provide me with any new knowledge, in the
sense in which empirical evidence that the election of May Queens had
been forbidden by law would provide me with new knowledge. If one had to
set forth all the information one possessed, with regard to matters of
fact, one would not write down any analytic propositions. But one would
make use of analytic propositions in compiling one’s encyclopaedia, and
would thus come to include propositions which one would otherwise have
overlooked. And, besides enabling one to make one’s list of information
complete, the formulation of analytic propositions would enable one to
make sure that the synthetic propositions of which the list was composed
formed a self-consistent system. By showing which ways of combining
propositions resulted in contradictions, they would prevent one from
including incompatible propositions and so making the list
self-stultifying. But in so far as we had actually used such words as
“all” and “or” and “not” without falling into self-contradiction, we
might be said already to know what was revealed in the formulation of
analytic propositions illustrating the rules which govern our usage of
these logical particles. So that here again we are justified in saying
that analytic propositions do not increase our knowledge.</p>
<p>The analytic character of the truths of formal logic was obscured in
the traditional logic through its being insufficiently formalized. For
in speaking always of judgements, instead of propositions, and
introducing irrelevant psychological questions, the traditional logic
gave the impression of being concerned in some specially intimate way
with the workings of thought. What it was actually concerned with was
the formal relationship of classes, as is shown by the fact that all its
principles of inference are subsumed in the Boolean class-calculus,
which is subsumed in its turn in the propositional calculus of Russell
and Whitehead.66 Their system, expounded in Principia Mathematica, makes
it clear that formal logic is not concerned with the properties of men’s
minds, much less with the properties of material objects, but simply
with the possibility of combining propositions by means of logical
particles into analytic propositions, and with studying the formal
relationship of these analytic propositions, in virtue of which one is
deducible from another. Their procedure is to exhibit the propositions
of formal logic as a deductive system, based on five primitive
propositions, subsequently reduced in number to one. Hereby the
distinction between logical truths and principles of inference, which
was maintained in the Aristotelian logic, very properly disappears.
Every principle of inference is put forward as a logical truth and every
logical truth can serve as a principle of inference. The three
Aristotelian “laws of thought,” the law of identity, the law of excluded
middle, and the law of non-contradiction, are incorporated in the
system, but they are not considered more important than the other
analytic propositions. They are not reckoned among the premises of the
system. And the system of Russell and Whitehead itself is probably only
one among many possible logics, each of which is composed of tautologies
as interesting to the logician as the arbitrarily selected Aristotelian
“laws of thought.”67</p>
<p>A point which is not sufficiently brought out by Russell, if indeed
it is recognised by him at all, is that every logical proposition is
valid in its own right. Its validity does not depend on its being
incorporated in a system, and deduced from certain propositions which
are taken as self-evident. The construction of systems of logic is
useful as a means of discovering and certifying analytic propositions,
but it is not in principle essential even for this purpose. For it is
possible to conceive of a symbolism in which every analytic proposition
could be seen to be analytic in virtue of its form alone.</p>
<p>The fact that the validity of an analytic proposition in no way
depends on its being deducible from other analytic propositions is our
justification for disregarding the question whether the propositions of
mathematics are reducible to propositions of formal logic, in the way
that Russell supposed.68 For even if it is the case that the definition
of a cardinal number as a class of classes similar to a given class is
circular, and it is not possible to reduce mathematical notions to
purely logical notions, it will still remain true that the propositions
of mathematics are analytic propositions. They will form a special class
of analytic propositions, containing special terms, but they will be
none the less analytic for that. For the criterion of an analytic
proposition is that its validity should follow simply from the
definition of the terms contained in it, and this condition is fulfilled
by the propositions of pure mathematics.</p>
<p>The mathematical propositions which one might most pardonably suppose
to be synthetic are the propositions of geometry. For it is natural for
us to think, as Kant thought, that geometry is the study of the
properties of physical space, and consequently that its propositions
have factual content. And if we believe this, and also recognise that
the truths of geometry are necessary and certain, then we may be
inclined to accept Kant’s hypothesis that space is the form of intuition
of our outer sense, a form imposed by us on the matter of sensation, as
the only possible explanation of our a priori knowledge of these
synthetic propositions. But while the view that pure geometry is
concerned with physical space was plausible enough in Kant’s day, when
the geometry of Euclid was the only geometry known, the subsequent
invention of non-Euclidean geometries has shown it to be mistaken. We
see now that the axioms of a geometry are simply definitions, and that
the theorems of a geometry are simply the logical consequences of these
definitions.69 A geometry is not in itself about physical space; in
itself it cannot be said to be “about” anything. But we can use a
geometry to reason about physical space. That is to say, once we have
given the axioms a physical interpretation, we can proceed to apply the
theorems to the objects which satisfy the axioms. Whether a geometry can
be applied to the actual physical world or not, is an empirical question
which falls outside the scope of the geometry itself. There is no sense,
therefore, in asking which of the various geometries known to us are
false and which are true. In so far as they are all free from
contradiction, they are all true. What one can ask is which of them is
the most useful on any given occasion, which of them can be applied most
easily and most fruitfully to an actual empirical situation. But the
proposition which states that a certain application of a geometry is
possible is not itself a proposition of that geometry. All that the
geometry itself tells us is that if anything can be brought under the
definitions, it will also satisfy the theorems. It is therefore a purely
logical system, and its propositions are purely analytic
propositions.</p>
<p>It might be objected that the use made of diagrams in geometrical
treatises shows that geometrical reasoning is not purely abstract and
logical, but depends on our intuition of the properties of figures. In
fact, however, the use of diagrams is not essential to completely
rigorous geometry. The diagrams are introduced as an aid to our reason.
They provide us with a particular application of the geometry, and so
assist us to perceive the more general truth that the axioms of the
geometry involve certain consequences. But the fact that most of us need
the help of an example to make us aware of those consequences does not
show that the relation between them and the axioms is not a purely
logical relation. It shows merely that our intellects are unequal to the
task of carrying out very abstract processes of reasoning without the
assistance of intuition. In other words, it has no bearing on the nature
of geometrical propositions, but is simply an empirical fact about
ourselves. Moreover, the appeal to intuition, though generally of
psychological value, is also a source of danger to the geometer. He is
tempted to make assumptions which are accidentally true of the
particular figure he is taking as an illustration, but do not follow
from his axioms. It has, indeed, been shown that Euclid himself was
guilty of this, and consequently that the presence of the figure is
essential to some of his proofs.70 This shows that his system is not, as
he presents it, completely rigorous, although of course it can be made
so. It does not show that the presence of the figure is essential to a
truly rigorous geometrical proof. To suppose that it did would be to
take as a necessary feature of all geometries what is really only an
incidental defect in one particular geometrical system.</p>
<p>We conclude, then, that the propositions of pure geometry are
analytic. And this leads us to reject Kant’s hypothesis that geometry
deals with the form of intuition of our outer sense. For the ground for
this hypothesis was that it alone explained how the propositions of
geometry could be both true a priori and synthetic: and we have seen
that they are not synthetic. Similarly our view that the propositions of
arithmetic are not synthetic but analytic leads us to reject the Kantian
hypothesis71 that arithmetic is concerned with our pure intuition of
time, the form of our inner sense. And thus we are able to dismiss
Kant’s transcendental æsthetic without having to bring forward the
epistemological difficulties which it is commonly said to involve. For
the only argument which can be brought in favour of Kant’s theory is
that it alone explains certain “facts.” And now we have found that the
“facts” which it purports to explain are not facts at all. For while it
is true that we have a priori knowledge of necessary propositions, it is
not true, as Kant supposed, that any of these necessary propositions are
synthetic. They are without exception analytic propositions, or, in
other words, iautologies.</p>
<p>We have already explained how it is that these analytic propositions
are necessary and certain. We saw that the reason why they cannot be
confuted in experience is that they do not make any assertion about the
empirical world. They simply record our determination to use words in a
certain fashion. We cannot deny them without infringing the conventions
which are presupposed by our very denial, and so falling into
self-contradiction. And this is the sole ground of their necessity. As
Wittgenstein puts it, our justification for holding that the world could
not conceivably disobey the laws of logic is simply that we could not
say of an unlogical world how it would look.72 And just as the validity
of an analytic proposition is independent of the nature of the external
world; so is it independent of the nature of our minds. It is perfectly
conceivable that we should have employed different linguistic
conventions from those which we actually do employ. But whatever these
conventions might be, the tautologies in which we recorded them would
always be necessary. For any denial of them would be
self-stultifying.</p>
<p>We see, then, that there is nothing mysterious about the apodeictic
certainty of logic and mathematics. Our knowledge that no observation
can ever confute the proposition “7+5 = 12” depends simply on the fact
that the symbolic expression “7+5” is synonymous with “12,” just as our
knowledge that every oculist is an eye-doctor depends on the fact that
the symbol “eye-doctor” is synonymous with “oculist.” And the same
explanation holds good for every other a priori truth.</p>
<p>What is mysterious at first sight is that these tautologies should on
occasion be so surprising, that there should be in mathematics and logic
the possibility of invention and discovery. As Poincaré says: “If all
the assertions which mathematics puts forward can be derived from one
another by formal logic, mathematics cannot amount to anything more than
an immense tautology. Logical inference can teach us nothing essentially
new, and if everything is to proceed from the principle of identity,
everything must be reducible to it. But can we really allow that these
theorems which fill so many books serve no other purpose than to say in
a roundabout fashion ‘A =A’?”73 Poincaré finds this incredible. His own
theory is that the sense of invention and discovery in mathematics
belongs to it in virtue of mathematical induction, the principle that
what is true for the number 1, and true for n+1 when it is true for n,74
is true for all numbers. And he claims that this is a synthetic a priori
principle. It is, in fact, a priori, but it is not synthetic. It is a
defining principle of the natural numbers, serving to distinguish them
from such numbers as the infinite cardinal numbers, to which it cannot
be applied.75 Moreover, we must remember that discoveries can be made,
not only in arithmetic, but also in geometry and formal logic, where no
use is made of mathematical induction. So that even if Poincaré were
right about mathematical induction, he would not have provided a
satisfactory explanation of the paradox that a mere body of tautologies
can be so interesting and so surprising.</p>
<p>The true explanation is very simple. The power of logic and
mathematics to surprise us depends, like their usefulness, on the
limitations of our reason. A being whose intellect was infinitely
powerful would take no interest in logic and mathematics.76 For he would
be able to see at a glance everything that his definitions implied, and,
accordingly, could never learn anything from logical inference which he
was not fully conscious of already. But our intellects are not of this
order. It is only a minute proportion of the consequences of our
definitions that we are able to detect at a glance. Even so simple a
tautology as “91 x 79 =7189” is beyond the scope of our immediate
apprehension. To assure ourselves that ”7189” is synonymous with “91x79”
we have to resort to calculation, which is simply a process of
tautological transformation—that is, a process by which we change the
form of expressions without altering their significance. The
multiplication tables are rules for carrying out this process in
arithmetic, just as the laws of logic are rules for the tautological
transformation of sentences expressed in logical symbolism or in
ordinary language. As the process of calculation is carried out more or
less mechanically, it is easy for us to make a slip and so unwittingly
contradict ourselves. And this accounts for the existence of logical and
mathematical “falsehoods,” which otherwise might appear paradoxical.
Clearly the risk of error in logical reasoning is proportionate to the
length and the complexity of the process of calculation. And in the same
way, the more complex an analytic proposition is, the more chance it has
of interesting and surprising us.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that the danger of error in logical reasoning can
be minimized by the introduction of symbolic devices, which enable us to
express highly complex tautologies in a conveniently simple form. And
this gives us an opportunity for the exercise of invention in the
pursuit of logical enquiries. For a well-chosen definition will call our
attention to analytic truths, which would otherwise have escaped us. And
the framing of definitions which are useful and fruitful may well be
regarded as a creative act.</p>
<p>Having thus shown that there is no inexplicable paradox involved in
the view that the truths of logic and mathematics are all of them
analytic, we may safely adopt it as the only satisfactory explanation of
their a priori necessity. And in adopting it we vindicate the empiricist
claim that there can be no a priori knowledge of reality. For we show
that the truths of pure reason, the propositions which we know to be
valid independently of all experience, are so only in virtue of their
lack of factual content. To say that a proposition is true a priori is
to say that it is a tautology. And tautologies, though they may serve to
guide us in our empirical search for knowledge, do not in themselves
contain any information about any matter of fact.</p>
