<p>Enter Valentine, Silvia, Turio 350 [and ] Speed</p>
<p>SILVIA Servant!</p>
<p>VALENTINE Mistress?</p>
<p>SPEED Master, Sir Turio frowns on you.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Ay, boy, it’s for love.</p>
<p>SPEED Not of you.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Of my mistress, then.</p>
<p>SPEED ’Twere good you knocked 351 him.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>SILVIA Servant, you are sad.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Indeed, madam, I seem so.</p>
<p>TURIO Seem you that 352 you are not?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Haply I do.</p>
<p>TURIO So do counterfeits 353 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE So do you.</p>
<p>TURIO What seem I that I am not?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Wise.</p>
<p>TURIO What instance 354 of the contrary?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Your folly.</p>
<p>TURIO And how quote 355 you my folly?</p>
<p>VALENTINE I quote it in your jerkin 356 .</p>
<p>TURIO My jerkin is a doublet 357 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE Well, then, I’ll double your folly.</p>
<p>TURIO How? 358</p>
<p>SILVIA What, angry, Sir Turio? Do you change colour?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Give him leave, madam, he is a kind of chameleon.</p>
<p>TURIO That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air
359 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE You have said, sir.</p>
<p>TURIO Ay, sir, and done 360 too, for this time 361 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE I know it well, sir: you always end ere you begin 362 .</p>
<p>SILVIA A fine volley 363 of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot
off.</p>
<p>VALENTINE ’Tis indeed, madam, we thank the giver.</p>
<p>SILVIA Who is that, servant?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Yourself, sweet lady, for you gave the fire 364 . Sir Turio
borrows his wit from your ladyship’s looks, and spends what he borrows
kindly 365 in your company.</p>
<p>TURIO Sir, if you spend 366 word for word with me, I shall make your
wit bankrupt.</p>
<p>VALENTINE I know it well, sir: you have an exchequer 367 of words
and, I think, no other treasure to give your followers, for it appears
by their bare liveries 368 that they live by your bare words.</p>
<p>SILVIA No more, gentlemen, no more: here comes my father.</p>
<p>[Enter Duke ]</p>
<p>DUKE Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset 369 .</p>
<p>Sir Valentine, your father is in good health:</p>
<p>What say you to a letter from your friends</p>
<p>Of much good news?</p>
<p>VALENTINE My lord, I will be thankful</p>
<p>To any happy messenger 370 from thence.</p>
<p>DUKE Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman 371 ?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman</p>
<p>To be of worth 372 and worthy estimation 373 ,</p>
<p>And not without desert 374 so well reputed.</p>
<p>DUKE Hath he not a son?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Ay, my good lord, a son that well deserves</p>
<p>The honour and regard of such a father.</p>
<p>DUKE You know him well?</p>
<p>VALENTINE I knew him as myself, for from our infancy</p>
<p>We have conversed and spent our hours together,</p>
<p>And though myself have been an idle truant,</p>
<p>Omitting 375 the sweet benefit of time</p>
<p>To clothe mine age 376 with angel-like perfection,</p>
<p>Yet hath Sir Proteus — for that’s his name —</p>
<p>Made use and fair advantage of his days:</p>
<p>His years but young, but his experience old,</p>
<p>His head unmellowed 377 but his judgement ripe 378 ,</p>
<p>And in a word — for far behind his worth</p>
<p>Comes all the praises that I now bestow —</p>
<p>He is complete 379 in feature 380 and in mind,</p>
<p>With all good grace to grace a gentleman.</p>
<p>DUKE Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good 381 ,</p>
<p>He is as worthy for an empress’ love,</p>
<p>As meet to be an emperor’s counsellor.</p>
<p>Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,</p>
<p>With commendation from great potentates 382 ,</p>
<p>And here he means to spend his time awhile:</p>
<p>I think ’tis no unwelcome news to you.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Should I have wished a thing, it had been he.</p>
<p>DUKE Welcome him then according to his worth.</p>
<p>Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Turio,</p>
<p>For Valentine, I need not cite 383 him to it:</p>
<p>I will send him hither to you presently.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>VALENTINE This is the gentleman I told your ladyship</p>
<p>Had come 384 along with me, but that his mistress</p>
<p>Did hold his eyes locked in her crystal looks 385 .</p>
<p>SILVIA Belike that 386 now she hath enfranchised them</p>
<p>Upon some other pawn for fealty 387 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.</p>
<p>SILVIA Nay, then he should be blind, and being blind,</p>
<p>How could he see his way to seek out you?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.</p>
<p>TURIO They say that Love hath not an eye at all 388 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE To see such lovers, Turio, as yourself:</p>
<p>Upon a homely 389 object, Love can wink 390 .</p>
<p>SILVIA Have done, have done: here comes the gentleman.</p>
<p>[Turio may exit ]</p>
<p>[Enter Proteus ]</p>
<p>VALENTINE Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,</p>
<p>Confirm his welcome with some special favour.</p>
<p>SILVIA His worth is warrant 391 for his welcome hither,</p>
<p>If this be he you oft have wished to hear from.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain 392 him</p>
<p>To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.</p>
<p>SILVIA Too low 393 a mistress for so high 394 a servant.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Not so, sweet lady: but too mean 395 a servant</p>
<p>To have a look of such a worthy mistress.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Leave off discourse of disability 396 :</p>
<p>Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.</p>
<p>PROTEUS My duty 397 will I boast of, nothing else.</p>
<p>SILVIA And duty never yet did want his meed 398 .</p>
<p>Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.</p>
<p>PROTEUS I’ll die 399 on him that says so but 400 yourself.</p>
<p>SILVIA That you are welcome?</p>
<p>PROTEUS That you are worthless.</p>
<p>[Enter Turio, or a servant enters and whispers to Turio ]</p>
<p>TURIO Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.</p>
<p>SILVIA I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Turio,</p>
<p>Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome.</p>
<p>I’ll leave you to confer of home affairs:</p>
<p>When you have done, we look to hear from you.</p>
<p>PROTEUS We’ll both attend upon your ladyship.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Silvia and Turio ]</p>
<p>VALENTINE Now, tell me: how do all from whence you came?</p>
<p>PROTEUS Your friends are well and have them much commended 401 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE And how do yours?</p>
<p>PROTEUS I left them all in health.</p>
<p>VALENTINE How does your lady? And how thrives your love?</p>
<p>PROTEUS My tales of love were wont to 402 weary you:</p>
<p>I know you joy not in a love discourse.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Ay, Proteus, but that life is altered now.</p>
<p>I have done penance for contemning 403 Love,</p>
<p>Whose high imperious 404 thoughts have punished me</p>
<p>With bitter fasts, with penitential 405 groans,</p>
<p>With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs:</p>
<p>For in revenge of my contempt of love,</p>
<p>Love hath chased sleep from my enthrallèd 406 eyes,</p>
<p>And made them watchers of 407 mine own heart’s sorrow.</p>
<p>O gentle Proteus, Love’s a mighty lord,</p>
<p>And hath so humbled me, as I confess,</p>
<p>There is no woe to his correction 408 ,</p>
<p>Nor to 409 his service no such joy on earth.</p>
<p>Now no discourse, except it be of love:</p>
<p>Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep</p>
<p>Upon the very naked 410 name of love.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Enough: I read your fortune in your eye.</p>
<p>Was this 411 the idol that you worship so?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Even she 412 ; and is she not a heavenly saint?</p>
<p>PROTEUS No, but she is an earthly paragon 413 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE Call her divine.</p>
<p>PROTEUS I will not flatter her.</p>
<p>VALENTINE O, flatter me, for love delights in praises.</p>
<p>PROTEUS When I was sick 414 , you gave me bitter pills 415 ,</p>
<p>And I must minister the like 416 to you.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Then speak the truth by 417 her; if not divine,</p>
<p>Yet let her be a principality 418 ,</p>
<p>Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Except my mistress.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Sweet 419 , except not any,</p>
<p>Except 420 thou wilt except against 421 my love.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Have I not reason to prefer 422 mine own?</p>
<p>VALENTINE And I will help thee to prefer her too:</p>
<p>She shall be dignified with this high honour,</p>
<p>To bear my lady’s train, lest the base earth</p>
<p>Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss 423 ,</p>
<p>And of so great a favour growing proud,</p>
<p>Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower 424</p>
<p>And make rough winter everlastingly.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Why, Valentine, what braggardism 425 is this?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Pardon me, Proteus: all I can 426 is nothing</p>
<p>To 427 her whose worth makes other worthies 428 nothing.</p>
<p>She is alone 429 .</p>
<p>PROTEUS Then let her alone.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,</p>
<p>And I as rich in having such a jewel</p>
<p>As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,</p>
<p>The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.</p>
<p>Forgive me that I do not dream on thee 430 ,</p>
<p>Because thou see’st me dote upon 431 my love.</p>
<p>My foolish rival, that her father likes —</p>
<p>Only for 432 his possessions are so huge —</p>
<p>Is gone with her along, and I must after:</p>
<p>For love, thou know’st, is full of jealousy.</p>
<p>PROTEUS But she loves you?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Ay, and we are betrothed: nay, more, our marriage-hour,</p>
<p>With all the cunning manner of our flight 433 ,</p>
<p>Determined of 434 : how I must climb her window,</p>
<p>The ladder made of cords, and all the means</p>
<p>Plotted and ’greed 435 on for my happiness.</p>
<p>Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,</p>
<p>In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Go on before: I shall inquire you forth 436 .</p>
<p>I must unto the road, to disembark 437</p>
<p>Some necessaries 438 that I needs must use,</p>
<p>And then I’ll presently attend you.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Will you make haste?</p>
<p>PROTEUS I will.</p>
<p>Exit [Valentine ]</p>
<p>Even as one heat another heat expels 439 ,</p>
<p>Or as one nail by strength drives out another,</p>
<p>So the remembrance 440 of my former love</p>
<p>Is by a newer object 441 quite forgotten.</p>
<p>Is it mine eye or Valentine’s praise?</p>
<p>Her true perfection or my false transgression 442</p>
<p>That makes me reasonless 443 to reason thus 444 ?</p>
<p>She is fair: and so is Julia that I love —</p>
<p>That I did love, for now my love is thawed,</p>
<p>Which, like a waxen image gainst a fire</p>
<p>Bears no impression of the thing it was.</p>
<p>Methinks my zeal 445 to Valentine is cold,</p>
<p>And that I love him not as I was wont.</p>
<p>O, but I love his lady too too much,</p>
<p>And that’s the reason I love him so little.</p>
<p>How shall I dote on her with more advice 446 ,</p>
<p>That thus without advice 447 begin to love her?</p>
<p>’Tis but her picture 448 I have yet beheld,</p>
<p>And that hath dazzlèd my reason’s light:</p>
<p>But when I look 449 on her perfections 450 ,</p>
<p>There is no reason but 451 I shall be blind.</p>
<p>If I can check 452 my erring 453 love, I will:</p>
<p>If not, to compass 454 her I’ll use my skill.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
