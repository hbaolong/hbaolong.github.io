17</h4>
<p>Enter Hamlet and Horatio</p>
<p>HAMLET So much for this 1758 , sir; now let me see the other 1759
:</p>
<p>You do remember all the circumstance 1760 ?</p>
<p>HORATIO Remember it, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting</p>
<p>That would not let me sleep: methought I lay</p>
<p>Worse than the mutines in the bilboes 1761 . Rashly 1762 —</p>
<p>And praise be rashness for it — let us know 1763</p>
<p>Our indiscretion 1764 sometimes serves us well,</p>
<p>When our dear 1765 plots do pall 1766 , and that should teach us</p>
<p>There’s a divinity that shapes our ends,</p>
<p>Rough-hew 1767 them how we will—</p>
<p>HORATIO That is most certain.</p>
<p>HAMLET Up from my cabin,</p>
<p>My sea-gown 1768 scarfed 1769 about me, in the dark</p>
<p>Groped I to find out them 1770 , had my desire,</p>
<p>Fingered 1771 their packet, and in fine 1772 withdrew</p>
<p>To mine own room again, making so bold —</p>
<p>My fears forgetting manners — to unseal</p>
<p>Their grand commission, where I found, Horatio —</p>
<p>O, royal knavery! — an exact command,</p>
<p>Larded 1773 with many several 1774 sorts of reason</p>
<p>Importing 1775 Denmark’s health and England’s too,</p>
<p>With, ho, such bugs 1776 and goblins in my life 1777 ,</p>
<p>That on the supervise 1778 , no leisure bated 1779 ,</p>
<p>No, not to stay 1780 the grinding of the axe,</p>
<p>My head should be struck off.</p>
<p>HORATIO Is’t possible?</p>
<p>HAMLET Here’s the commission: read it at more leisure.</p>
<p>Gives a paper</p>
<p>But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?</p>
<p>HORATIO I beseech you.</p>
<p>HAMLET Being thus benetted round 1781 with villainies —</p>
<p>Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,</p>
<p>They had begun the play 1782 — I sat me down,</p>
<p>Devised a new commission, wrote it fair 1783 :</p>
<p>I once did hold it, as our statists 1784 do,</p>
<p>A baseness to write fair and laboured much</p>
<p>How to forget that learning, but, sir, now</p>
<p>It did me yeoman’s 1785 service. Wilt thou know</p>
<p>The effect 1786 of what I wrote?</p>
<p>HORATIO Ay, good my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET An earnest conjuration 1787 from the king,</p>
<p>As England was his faithful tributary 1788 ,</p>
<p>As love between them as the palm should flourish,</p>
<p>As peace should still 1789 her wheaten garland 1790 wear</p>
<p>And stand a comma 1791 ’tween their amities 1792 ,</p>
<p>And many such-like ’As’es 1793 of great charge 1794 ,</p>
<p>That on the view and know of these contents,</p>
<p>Without debatement further, more or less,</p>
<p>He should the bearers put to sudden death,</p>
<p>Not shriving-time 1795 allowed.</p>
<p>HORATIO How was this sealed?</p>
<p>HAMLET Why, even in that was heaven ordinant 1796 .</p>
<p>I had my father’s signet 1797 in my purse,</p>
<p>Which was the model of that Danish seal 1798 :</p>
<p>Folded the writ 1799 up in form of the other,</p>
<p>Subscribed 1800 it, gave’t th’impression 1801 , placed it safely,</p>
<p>The changeling 1802 never known. Now, the next day</p>
<p>Was our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent 1803</p>
<p>Thou know’st already.</p>
<p>HORATIO So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to’t.</p>
<p>HAMLET Why, man, they did make love to 1804 this employment:</p>
<p>They are not near my conscience; their defeat 1805</p>
<p>Doth by their own insinuation 1806 grow.</p>
<p>’Tis dangerous when the baser 1807 nature comes</p>
<p>Between the pass 1808 and fell 1809 incensèd points 1810</p>
<p>Of mighty opposites 1811 .</p>
<p>HORATIO Why, what a king is this!</p>
<p>HAMLET Does it not, think’st thee, stand me now upon 1812 —</p>
<p>He that hath killed my king and whored my mother,</p>
<p>Popped in between th’election 1813 and my hopes,</p>
<p>Thrown out his angle 1814 for my proper 1815 life,</p>
<p>And with such cozenage 1816 — is’t not perfect conscience</p>
<p>To quit 1817 him with this arm? And is’t not to be damned,</p>
<p>To let this canker 1818 of our nature come</p>
<p>In 1819 further evil?</p>
<p>HORATIO It must be shortly known to him from England</p>
<p>What is the issue 1820 of the business there.</p>
<p>HAMLET It will be short: the interim is mine,</p>
<p>And a man’s life’s no more than to say ‘one’ 1821 .</p>
<p>But I am very sorry, good Horatio,</p>
<p>That to Laertes I forgot myself;</p>
<p>For by the image of my cause I see</p>
<p>The portraiture of his 1822 . I’ll count his favours.</p>
<p>But, sure, the bravery 1823 of his grief did put me</p>
<p>Into a tow’ring passion.</p>
<p>HORATIO Peace, who comes here?</p>
<p>Enter young Osric</p>
<p>Takes off his hat</p>
<p>OSRIC Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.</p>
<p>HAMLET I humbly thank you, sir.— Dost know this water-fly 1824 ?</p>
<p>HORATIO No, my good lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Thy state is the more gracious 1825 , for ’tis a vice to know
him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and
his crib 1826 shall stand at the king’s mess 1827 ; ’tis a chough 1828 ,
but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.</p>
<p>OSRIC Sweet lord, if your friendship were at leisure 1829 , I should
impart a thing to you from his majesty.</p>
<p>HAMLET I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your
bonnet 1830 to his right use: ’tis for the head.</p>
<p>OSRIC I thank your lordship, ’tis very hot.</p>
<p>HAMLET No, believe me, ’tis very cold: the wind is northerly.</p>
<p>OSRIC It is indifferent 1831 cold, my lord, indeed.</p>
<p>HAMLET Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion 1832
.</p>
<p>OSRIC Exceedingly, my lord: it is very sultry, as ’twere, I cannot
tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has
laid a great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter—</p>
<p>HAMLET I beseech you remember 1833 —</p>
<p>Gestures towards hat</p>
<p>OSRIC Nay, in good faith, for mine ease 1834 , in good faith. Sir,
you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at his weapon.</p>
<p>HAMLET What’s his weapon?</p>
<p>OSRIC Rapier 1835 and dagger.</p>
<p>HAMLET That’s two of his weapons; but, well 1836 .</p>
<p>OSRIC The king, sir, has waged with him six Barbary horses 1837 ,
against the which he imponed 1838 , as I take it, six French rapiers and
poniards 1839 , with their assigns 1840 , as 1841 girdle 1842 , hangers
1843 or so. Three of the carriages 1844 , in faith, are very dear to
fancy 1845 , very responsive to the hilts 1846 , most delicate 1847
carriages, and of very liberal conceit 1848 .</p>
<p>HAMLET What call you 1849 the carriages?</p>
<p>OSRIC The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</p>
<p>HAMLET The phrase would be more germane 1850 to the matter, if we
could carry cannon by our sides 1851 : I would it might be hangers till
then. But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that’s the French bet
against the Danish. Why is this ‘imponed’ as you call it?</p>
<p>OSRIC The king, sir, hath laid 1852 , that in a dozen passes 1853
between you and him 1854 , he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath
laid on twelve for nine 1855 , and that would come to immediate trial,
if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer 1856 .</p>
<p>HAMLET How if I answer ‘no’?</p>
<p>OSRIC I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial 1857
.</p>
<p>HAMLET Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty,
’tis the breathing time 1858 of day with me; let the foils be brought,
the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, I will win for him
if I can: if not, I’ll gain nothing but my shame and the odd 1859
hits.</p>
<p>OSRIC Shall I redeliver you 1860 e’en so?</p>
<p>HAMLET To this effect, sir, after what flourish 1861 your nature
will.</p>
<p>OSRIC I commend 1862 my duty to your lordship.</p>
<p>HAMLET Yours, yours.—</p>
<p>[Exit Osric]</p>
<p>He does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else for’s
turn 1863 .</p>
<p>HORATIO This lapwing 1864 runs away with the shell on his head 1865
.</p>
<p>HAMLET He did comply with his dug 1866 , before he sucked it. Thus
has he — and many more of the same bevy 1867 that I know the drossy 1868
age dotes on — only got the tune 1869 of the time and outward habit of
encounter 1870 , a kind of yeasty 1871 collection 1872 , which carries
them through 1873 and through the most fond 1874 and winnowed 1875
opinions; and do but blow them to their trials, the bubbles are out 1876
.</p>
<p>HORATIO You will lose this wager, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET I do not think so: since he went into France, I have been in
continual practice; I shall win at the odds 1877 . But thou wouldst not
think how ill all’s here about my heart, but it is no matter.</p>
<p>HORATIO Nay, good my lord—</p>
<p>HAMLET It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving 1878
as would perhaps trouble a woman.</p>
<p>HORATIO If your mind dislike anything, obey it: I will forestall
their repair 1879 hither, and say you are not fit.</p>
<p>HAMLET Not a whit, we defy augury 1880 : there’s a special providence
in the fall of a sparrow 1881 . If it 1882 be now, ’tis not to come: if
it be not to come, it will be now: if it be not now, yet it will come:
the readiness 1883 is all. Since no man has aught of 1884 what he
leaves, what is’t to leave betimes 1885 ?</p>
<p>Enter King, Queen, Laertes and Lords, with [Osric and] other
Attendants with foils and gauntlets 1886 , a table and flagons of wine
on it</p>
<p>KING Come, Hamlet, come and take this hand from me.</p>
<p>Puts Laertes’ hand into Hamlet’s</p>
<p>HAMLET Give me your pardon, sir: I’ve done you wrong,</p>
<p>But pardon’t, as you are a gentleman.</p>
<p>This presence 1887 knows,</p>
<p>And you must needs have heard, how I am punished</p>
<p>With sore distraction. What I have done</p>
<p>That might your nature 1888 , honour and exception 1889</p>
<p>Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.</p>
<p>Was’t Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet:</p>
<p>If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,</p>
<p>And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,</p>
<p>Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.</p>
<p>Who does it, then? His madness. If’t be so,</p>
<p>Hamlet is of the faction 1890 that is wronged,</p>
<p>His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.</p>
<p>Sir, in this audience,</p>
<p>Let my disclaiming from 1891 a purposed 1892 evil</p>
<p>Free me so far in your most generous 1893 thoughts</p>
<p>That I have 1894 shot mine arrow o’er the house,</p>
<p>And hurt my brother.</p>
<p>LAERTES I am satisfied in nature,</p>
<p>Whose motive in this case should stir me most</p>
<p>To my revenge: but in my terms of honour 1895</p>
<p>I stand aloof, and will 1896 no reconcilement</p>
<p>Till by some elder masters, of known honour</p>
<p>I have a voice 1897 and precedent of peace 1898 ,</p>
<p>To keep my name ungored 1899 . But till that time,</p>
<p>I do receive your offered love like love,</p>
<p>And will not wrong it.</p>
<p>HAMLET I do embrace it freely,</p>
<p>And will this brother’s wager frankly 1900 play.—</p>
<p>Give us the foils. Come on.</p>
<p>LAERTES Come, one for me.</p>
<p>HAMLET I’ll be your foil 1901 , Laertes: in mine ignorance</p>
<p>Your skill shall, like a star i’th’darkest night,</p>
<p>Stick fiery off 1902 indeed.</p>
<p>LAERTES You mock me, sir.</p>
<p>HAMLET No, by this hand.</p>
<p>KING Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,</p>
<p>You know the wager?</p>
<p>HAMLET Very well, my lord:</p>
<p>Your grace hath laid the odds 1903 o’th’weaker side.</p>
<p>KING I do not fear it: I have seen you both:</p>
<p>But since he is bettered 1904 , we have therefore odds 1905 .</p>
<p>LAERTES This is too heavy, let me see another.</p>
<p>Looks over the foils</p>
<p>HAMLET This likes 1906 me well. These foils have all a length 1907
?</p>
<p>Prepare to play</p>
<p>OSRIC Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p>KING Set me the stoups 1908 of wine upon that table:</p>
<p>If Hamlet give the first or second hit,</p>
<p>Or quit in answer of the third exchange 1909 ,</p>
<p>Let all the battlements their ordnance 1910 fire:</p>
<p>The king shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath 1911 ,</p>
<p>And in the cup an union 1912 shall he throw</p>
<p>Richer than that which four successive kings</p>
<p>In Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups,</p>
<p>And let the kettle 1913 to the trumpets speak,</p>
<p>The trumpet to the cannoneer without,</p>
<p>The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,</p>
<p>‘Now the king drinks to Hamlet.’ Come, begin:</p>
<p>And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.</p>
<p>HAMLET Come on, sir.</p>
<p>LAERTES Come on, sir.</p>
<p>They play</p>
<p>HAMLET One.</p>
<p>LAERTES No.</p>
<p>HAMLET Judgement.</p>
<p>OSRIC A hit, a very palpable hit.</p>
<p>LAERTES Well, again.</p>
<p>KING Stay, give me drink.— Hamlet, this pearl is thine:</p>
<p>Drinks, then puts the pearl in the cup?</p>
<p>Here’s to thy health.— Give him the cup.</p>
<p>Trumpets sound and shot goes off</p>
<p>HAMLET I’ll play this bout first: set by awhile.— Come.</p>
<p>They play</p>
<p>Another hit; what say you?</p>
<p>LAERTES A touch, a touch, I do confess.</p>
<p>KING Our son shall win.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE He’s fat 1914 , and scant of breath.—</p>
<p>Here’s a napkin 1915 , rub thy brows:</p>
<p>To Hamlet</p>
<p>The queen carouses to 1916 thy fortune, Hamlet.</p>
<p>HAMLET Good madam.</p>
<p>KING Gertrude, do not drink!</p>
<p>GERTRUDE I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.</p>
<p>Drinks</p>
<p>KING It is the poisoned cup: it is too late.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>HAMLET I dare not drink yet, madam: by and by.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Come, let me wipe thy face.</p>
<p>LAERTES My lord, I’ll hit him now.</p>
<p>To the King</p>
<p>KING I do not think’t.</p>
<p>LAERTES And yet ’tis almost gainst my conscience.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>HAMLET Come, for the third: Laertes, you but dally.</p>
<p>I pray you pass 1917 with your best violence:</p>
<p>I am afeard you make a wanton 1918 of me 1919 .</p>
<p>LAERTES Say you so? Come on.</p>
<p>Play</p>
<p>OSRIC Nothing, neither way.</p>
<p>LAERTES Have at you now!</p>
<p>In scuffling 1920 they change 1921 rapiers</p>
<p>KING Part them: they are incensed.</p>
<p>HAMLET Nay, come, again.</p>
<p>Gertrude falls?</p>
<p>OSRIC Look to the queen there, ho!</p>
<p>HORATIO They bleed on both sides.— How is it, my lord?</p>
<p>To Hamlet</p>
<p>OSRIC How is’t, Laertes?</p>
<p>LAERTES Why, as a woodcock 1922 to mine own springe 1923 , Osric:</p>
<p>I am justly killed with mine own treachery.</p>
<p>HAMLET How does the queen?</p>
<p>KING She swoons to see them bleed.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE No, no, the drink, the drink — O my dear Hamlet —</p>
<p>The drink, the drink! I am poisoned.</p>
<p>Dies</p>
<p>HAMLET O, villainy! Ho! Let the door be locked:</p>
<p>Treachery! Seek it out.</p>
<p>LAERTES It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain:</p>
<p>No medicine in the world can do thee good,</p>
<p>In thee there is not half an hour of life;</p>
<p>The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,</p>
<p>Unbated and envenomed. The foul practice 1924</p>
<p>Hath turned itself on me: lo, here I lie,</p>
<p>Never to rise again. Thy mother’s poisoned.</p>
<p>I can no more. The king, the king’s to blame.</p>
<p>HAMLET The point envenomed too!</p>
<p>Then, venom, to thy work.</p>
<p>Hurts the King</p>
<p>ALL Treason! Treason!</p>
<p>KING O, yet defend me, friends, I am but hurt.</p>
<p>HAMLET Here, thou incestuous, murd’rous, damnèd Dane,</p>
<p>Drink off 1925 this potion. Is thy union 1926 here?</p>
<p>Follow my mother.</p>
<p>King dies</p>
<p>LAERTES He is justly served:</p>
<p>It is a poison tempered 1927 by himself.</p>
<p>Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:</p>
<p>Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee,</p>
<p>Nor thine on me.</p>
<p>Dies</p>
<p>HAMLET Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.—</p>
<p>I am dead, Horatio.— Wretched queen, adieu!—</p>
<p>You that look pale and tremble at this chance 1928 ,</p>
<p>That are but mutes 1929 or audience to this act 1930 ,</p>
<p>Had I but time — as this fell 1931 sergeant, death,</p>
<p>Is strict 1932 in his arrest 1933 — O, I could tell you.</p>
<p>But let it be.— Horatio, I am dead:</p>
<p>Thou liv’st: report me and my causes 1934 right</p>
<p>To the unsatisfied 1935 .</p>
<p>HORATIO Never believe it.</p>
<p>I am more an antique Roman 1936 than a Dane:</p>
<p>Here’s yet some liquor left.</p>
<p>HAMLET As thou’rt a man,</p>
<p>Give me the cup: let go, by heaven, I’ll have’t.</p>
<p>O, good Horatio, what a wounded name —</p>
<p>Things standing thus unknown — shall live behind me!</p>
<p>If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,</p>
<p>Absent thee from felicity 1937 awhile,</p>
<p>And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,</p>
<p>To tell my story.</p>
<p>March afar off and shot within</p>
<p>What warlike noise is this?</p>
<p>Enter Osric</p>
<p>OSRIC Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,</p>
<p>To th’ambassadors of England gives</p>
<p>This warlike volley.</p>
<p>HAMLET O, I die, Horatio:</p>
<p>The potent poison quite o’er-crows 1938 my spirit.</p>
<p>I cannot live to hear the news from England,</p>
<p>But I do prophesy th’election 1939 lights</p>
<p>On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice 1940 ,</p>
<p>So tell him, with the occurrents 1941 more and less</p>
<p>Which have solicited 1942 . The rest is silence. O, o, o, o! 1943</p>
<p>Dies</p>
<p>HORATIO Now cracks a noble heart. Goodnight, sweet prince,</p>
<p>And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!—</p>
<p>Why does the drum come hither?</p>
<p>Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador, with Drum, Colours 1944 and
Attendants</p>
<p>FORTINBRAS Where is this sight?</p>
<p>HORATIO What is it ye would 1945 see?</p>
<p>If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.</p>
<p>FORTINBRAS This quarry 1946 cries on havoc 1947 . O proud death,</p>
<p>What feast is toward 1948 in thine eternal cell 1949 ,</p>
<p>That thou so many princes at a shot</p>
<p>So bloodily hast struck?</p>
<p>AMBASSADOR The sight is dismal 1950 ,</p>
<p>And our affairs from England come too late:</p>
<p>The ears 1951 are senseless that should give us hearing,</p>
<p>To tell him his commandment is fulfilled,</p>
<p>That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.</p>
<p>Where should we have our thanks?</p>
<p>HORATIO Not from his mouth,</p>
<p>Had it th’ability of life to thank you:</p>
<p>He never gave commandment for their death.</p>
<p>But since, so jump 1952 upon this bloody question 1953 ,</p>
<p>You from the Polack wars, and you from England,</p>
<p>Are here arrived, give order that these bodies</p>
<p>High on a stage 1954 be placèd to the view 1955 ,</p>
<p>And let me speak to th’yet unknowing world</p>
<p>How these things came about: so shall you hear</p>
<p>Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts,</p>
<p>Of accidental judgements 1956 , casual 1957 slaughters,</p>
<p>Of deaths put on 1958 by cunning and forced cause 1959 ,</p>
<p>And, in this upshot 1960 , purposes mistook</p>
<p>Fall’n on the inventors’ heads: all this can I</p>
<p>Truly deliver 1961 .</p>
<p>FORTINBRAS Let us haste to hear it,</p>
<p>And call the noblest to the audience.</p>
<p>For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:</p>
<p>I have some rights of memory 1962 in this kingdom,</p>
<p>Which now to claim my vantage 1963 doth invite me.</p>
<p>HORATIO Of that I shall have also cause to speak,</p>
<p>And from his mouth whose voice 1964 will draw on 1965 more:</p>
<p>But let this same 1966 be presently 1967 performed,</p>
<p>Even while men’s minds are wild 1968 , lest more mischance</p>
<p>On 1969 plots and errors happen.</p>
<p>FORTINBRAS Let four captains</p>
<p>Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage,</p>
<p>For he was likely, had he been put on 1970 ,</p>
<p>To have proved most royally: and for his passage 1971 ,</p>
<p>The soldiers’ music and the rites of war</p>
<p>Speak 1972 loudly for him.</p>
<p>Take up the body: such a sight as this</p>
<p>Becomes the field 1973 , but here shows much amiss 1974 .</p>
<p>Go, bid the soldiers shoot.</p>
<p>Exeunt marching. After the which a peal of ordnance are shot off</p>

<p>Second Quarto Passages That Do Not Appear in the Folio</p>
<p>Following 1.1 here :</p>
<p>BARNARDO I think it be no other but e’en so:</p>
<p>Well may it sort that this portentous figure</p>
<p>Comes armèd through our watch, so like the king</p>
<p>That was and is the question of these wars.</p>
<p>HORATIO A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.</p>
<p>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</p>
<p>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</p>
<p>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</p>
<p>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:</p>
<p>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</p>
<p>Disasters in the sun, and the moist star</p>
<p>Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands</p>
<p>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:</p>
<p>And even the like precurse of feared events,</p>
<p>As harbingers preceding still the fates</p>
<p>And prologue to the omen coming on,</p>
<p>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</p>
<p>Unto our climatures and countrymen.—</p>
<p>Following 1.2 here :</p>
<p>wrung from me my slow leave</p>
<p>By laboursome petition, and at last</p>
<p>Upon his will I sealed my hard consent.</p>
<p>Following 1.4 here :</p>
<p>This heavy-headed revel east and west</p>
<p>Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations:</p>
<p>They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase</p>
<p>Soil our addition: and indeed it takes</p>
<p>From our achievements, though performed at height,</p>
<p>The pith and marrow of our attribute.</p>
<p>So, oft it chances in particular men</p>
<p>That for some vicious mole of nature in them,</p>
<p>As in their birth — wherein they are not guilty,</p>
<p>Since nature cannot choose his origin —</p>
<p>By their o’ergrowth of some complexion,</p>
<p>Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,</p>
<p>Or by some habit that too much o’erleavens</p>
<p>The form of plausive manners, that these men,</p>
<p>Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,</p>
<p>Being nature’s livery, or fortune’s star,</p>
<p>His virtues else — be they as pure as grace,</p>
<p>As infinite as man may undergo —</p>
<p>Shall in the general censure take corruption</p>
<p>From that particular fault: the dram of eale</p>
<p>Doth all the noble substance often douse,</p>
<p>To his own scandal.</p>
<p>Following 1.4 here :</p>
<p>The very place puts toys of desperation,</p>
<p>Without more motive, into every brain</p>
<p>That looks so many fathoms to the sea</p>
<p>And hears it roar beneath.</p>
<p>Following 3.2 here :</p>
<p>Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear:</p>
<p>Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.</p>
<p>Following 3.2 here :</p>
<p>To desperation turn my trust and hope!</p>
<p>An anchor’s cheer in prison be my scope,</p>
<p>Following 3.4 here (before ’ What devil was’t’) :</p>
<p>Sense sure, you have,</p>
<p>Else could you not have motion: but sure that sense</p>
<p>Is apoplexed, for madness would not err</p>
<p>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne’er so thralled</p>
<p>But it reserved some quantity of choice,</p>
<p>To serve in such a difference.</p>
<p>Following 3.4 here :</p>
<p>Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,</p>
<p>Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,</p>
<p>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</p>
<p>Could not so mope.</p>
<p>Following 3.4 here :</p>
<p>That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat</p>
<p>Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,</p>
<p>That to the use of actions fair and good</p>
<p>He likewise gives a frock or livery,</p>
<p>That aptly is put on.</p>
<p>Following 3.4 here (before ’ Once more, goodnight’) :</p>
<p>the next more easy,</p>
<p>For use almost can change the stamp of nature,</p>
<p>And either [ ] the devil, or throw him out</p>
<p>With wondrous potency.</p>
<p>Following 3.4 here :</p>
<p>One word more, good lady.</p>
<p>Following 3.4 here :</p>
<p>HAMLET There’s letters sealed: and my two schoolfellows,</p>
<p>Whom I will trust as I will adders fanged,</p>
<p>They bear the mandate, they must sweep my way,</p>
<p>And marshal me to knavery. Let it work:</p>
<p>For ’tis the sport to have the enginer</p>
<p>Hoist with his own petard: and’t shall go hard</p>
<p>But I will delve one yard below their mines</p>
<p>And blow them at the moon. O, ’tis most sweet</p>
<p>When in one line two crafts directly meet.</p>
<p>Following 4.3 here :</p>
<p>Exeunt all [but the Captain]</p>
<p>Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz and others</p>
<p>HAMLET Good sir, whose powers are these?</p>
<p>CAPTAIN They are of Norway, sir.</p>
<p>HAMLET How purposed, sir, I pray you?</p>
<p>CAPTAIN Against some part of Poland.</p>
<p>HAMLET Who commands them, sir?</p>
<p>CAPTAIN The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.</p>
<p>HAMLET Goes it against the main of Poland, sir, Or for some
frontier?</p>
<p>CAPTAIN Truly to speak, and with no addition,</p>
<p>We go to gain a little patch of ground</p>
<p>That hath in it no profit but the name.</p>
<p>To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it:</p>
<p>Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole</p>
<p>A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.</p>
<p>HAMLET Why, then the Polack never will defend it.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN Yes, it is already garrisoned.</p>
<p>HAMLET Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats</p>
<p>Will not debate the question of this straw!</p>
<p>This is th’imposthume of much wealth and peace,</p>
<p>That inward breaks, and shows no cause without</p>
<p>Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN God buy you, sir.</p>
<p>[Exit]</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Will’t please you go, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET I’ll be with you straight: go a little before.</p>
<p>[Exeunt all but Hamlet]</p>
<p>How all occasions do inform against me,</p>
<p>And spur my dull revenge. What is a man,</p>
<p>If his chief good and market of his time</p>
<p>Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.</p>
<p>Sure he that made us with such large discourse,</p>
<p>Looking before and after, gave us not</p>
<p>That capability and godlike reason</p>
<p>To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be</p>
<p>Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple</p>
<p>Of thinking too precisely on th’event —</p>
<p>A thought which, quartered, hath but one part wisdom</p>
<p>And ever three parts coward — I do not know</p>
<p>Why yet I live to say this thing’s to do,</p>
<p>Sith I have cause and will and strength and means</p>
<p>To do’t. Examples gross as earth exhort me:</p>
<p>Witness this army of such mass and charge</p>
<p>Led by a delicate and tender prince,</p>
<p>Whose spirit with divine ambition puffed</p>
<p>Makes mouths at the invisible event,</p>
<p>Exposing what is mortal and unsure</p>
<p>To all that fortune, death and danger dare,</p>
<p>Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great</p>
<p>Is not to stir without great argument,</p>
<p>But greatly to find quarrel in a straw</p>
<p>When honour’s at the stake. How stand I then,</p>
<p>That have a father killed, a mother stained,</p>
<p>Excitements of my reason and my blood,</p>
<p>And let all sleep, while to my shame I see</p>
<p>The imminent death of twenty thousand men</p>
<p>That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,</p>
<p>Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot</p>
<p>Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,</p>
<p>Which is not tomb enough and continent</p>
<p>To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,</p>
<p>My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Following 4.6 here :</p>
<p>Of him that brought them.</p>
<p>Following 4.6 here (before ’ Some two months since’) :</p>
<p>LAERTES My lord, I will be ruled,</p>
<p>The rather, if you could devise it so</p>
<p>That I might be the organ.</p>
<p>KING It falls right.</p>
<p>You have been talked of since your travel much,</p>
<p>And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality</p>
<p>Wherein they say you shine: your sum of parts</p>
<p>Did not together pluck such envy from him</p>
<p>As did that one, and that, in my regard,</p>
<p>Of the unworthiest siege.</p>
<p>LAERTES What part is that, my lord?</p>
<p>KING A very ribbon in the cap of youth,</p>
<p>Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes</p>
<p>The light and careless livery that it wears</p>
<p>Than settled age his sables and his weeds</p>
<p>Importing health and graveness.</p>
<p>Following 4.6 here (before ’ Sir, this report’) :</p>
<p>The scrimers of their nation,</p>
<p>He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,</p>
<p>If you opposed them.</p>
<p>Following 4.6 here :</p>
<p>There lives within the very flame of love</p>
<p>A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it:</p>
<p>And nothing is at a like goodness still,</p>
<p>For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,</p>
<p>Dies in his own too much. That we would do,</p>
<p>We should do when we would, for this ‘would’ changes</p>
<p>And hath abatements and delays as many</p>
<p>As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents,</p>
<p>And then this ‘should’ is like a spendthrift sigh</p>
<p>That hurts by easing. But, to the quick of th’ulcer:</p>
<p>Following 5.2 here (before ’ Sir, you are not ignorant of’) :</p>
<p>Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes — believe me, an absolute
gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the continent of what part
a gentleman would see.</p>
<p>HAMLET Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I
know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy th’arithmetic of memory,
and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article and his
infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him,
his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage,
nothing more.</p>
<p>OSRIC Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.</p>
<p>HAMLET The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
rawer breath?</p>
<p>OSRIC Sir?</p>
<p>HORATIO Is’t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will
do’t, sir, really.</p>
<p>HAMLET What imports the nomination of this gentleman?</p>
<p>OSRIC Of Laertes?</p>
<p>HORATIO His purse is empty already: all’s golden words are spent.</p>
<p>HAMLET Of him, sir.</p>
<p>OSRIC I know you are not ignorant—</p>
<p>HAMLET I would you did, sir. Yet in faith if you did, it would not
much approve me. Well, sir?</p>
<p>OSRIC You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—</p>
<p>HAMLET I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
excellence: but to know a man well were to know himself.</p>
<p>OSRIC I mean, sir, for his weapon: but in the imputation laid on him,
by them in his meed, he’s unfellowed.</p>
<p>Following 5.2 here :</p>
<p>HORATIO I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had
done.</p>
<p>Following 5.2 here :</p>
<p>Enter a Lord</p>
<p>LORD My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who
brings back to him that you attend him in the hall: he sends to know if
your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you</p>
<p>will take longer time.</p>
<p>HAMLET I am constant to my purposes, they follow the king’s pleasure:
if his fitness speaks, mine is ready. Now or whensoever, provided I be
so able as now.</p>
<p>LORD The king and queen and all are coming down.</p>
<p>HAMLET In happy time.</p>
<p>LORD The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
Laertes before you fall to play.</p>
<p>HAMLET She well instructs me.</p>
<p>[Exit Lord]</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster , and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading ‘bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
