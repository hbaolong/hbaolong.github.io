to The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus</h4>
<p>From the 1700s to the Second World War Titus Andronicus was
considered so shocking and such a subversion of the noble Roman ideal of
decorum that it was hardly ever staged and was frequently said to be by
someone other than Shakespeare. High-minded critics and scholars could
not imagine the National Poet soiling himself with a barbaric feast of
rape, dismemberment and cannibalism. Yet Titus was one of the most
popular plays of the Elizabethan age.</p>
<p>A glorious mishmash of history and invention, it creates an imaginary
Rome that is simultaneously democratic and imperial. The play is not so
much an historical work as a meditation on history. We might call it a
‘meta-history’. The political structures of the early Roman republic and
the decadence of the late Roman Empire are deliberately overlaid upon
each other. They are also mingled with the preoccupations of late
Elizabethan England: the opening political dispute between Saturninus
and Bassianus is over the question of the succession to the recently
deceased emperor, a matter of considerable concern at the time
Shakespeare was writing, when the old Virgin Queen was nearing the end
of her life and there were several rival candidates to succeed her.</p>
<p>We are asked to imagine that this could be any time in the Roman era
and no time. The spiral of revenge begins with an act of human
sacrifice, the slaying of Tamora’s son Alarbus to appease the spirits of
those of Titus’ sons who have been killed in the wars against the Goths.
Historically, human sacrifice was never practised in ancient Rome, but
all cultures have their foundational myths of sacrifice. For Shakespeare
and his audience, Rome was evocative of the Roman Catholic Church as
well as the pagan empire of the past. So it is that the action is
peppered with allusions to the ultimate sacrifice, the crucifixion of
God’s own Son, and to the doctrinal differences consequent upon it. The
word martyred , which was deeply significant to both Catholics and
Protestants, is applied to Lavinia, and when she assists her father in
the butchery of Chiron and Demetrius, she is asked to ‘receive the
blood’, a phrase that darkly parodies the language of the Eucharist, in
which we are redeemed by the blood of Christ – though whether the wine
of the feast was real or symbolic blood was a matter for fierce
debate.</p>
<p>The play sealed Shakespeare’s reputation as the authentic successor
to the original angry young man of English drama, Christopher Marlowe.
Aaron’s delight in his own villainy is shamelessly pillaged from
Barabas’ and Ithamore’s boasting in the same vein in Marlowe’s Jew of
Malta. Shakespeare was a contrarian. He took the commonplaces of his age
and stood them on their heads – or perhaps sliced off their heads and
baked them in a pasty. Rome was synonymous with civilization and the
Goths with barbarism: so Shakespeare considers the possibility that Rome
was just as barbarous as the Gothic forest. Roman Stoicism proposed that
it was healthy to keep your emotions under tight restraint: so
Shakespeare voices the need to give your feelings vent (‘Sorrow
concealed, like an oven stopped, / Doth burn the heart to cinders where
it is’). The law prescribed that punishment should be left to the
justice system: so Shakespeare dramatized the primal – though ultimately
self-destructive – attraction of acting out revenge for oneself. A
daughter has been raped and mutilated. The law is not there to help;
even the poor Clown goes from quest for imperial justice to arbitrary
execution. Titus accordingly raises the stakes and thinks of a revenge
so hideous that it outdoes the original crime. This is but an extreme
version of an instinct that is still with us: the police do nothing
about the burglaries, so out comes the homeowner’s shotgun.</p>
<p>Structurally, the violence in Titus is always artistically
purposeful, never gratuitous. There is a harsh but elegant symmetry to
the action. Alarbus’ limbs are lopped, and so then are Lavinia’s: since
Tamora, Queen of the Goths, loses her son, so Titus, General of the
Romans, must lose his daughter. Ever since the time of ancient Greek
tragedy, western culture has been haunted by the figure of the revenger.
He or she stands on a whole series of borderlines: between civilization
and barbarity, between an individual’s accountability to his or her own
conscience and the community’s need for the rule of law, between the
conflicting demands of justice and mercy. Do we have a right – a duty
even – to exact revenge against those who have destroyed our loved ones?
Or should we leave vengeance to the law or the gods? And if we do take
action into our own hands, are we not reducing ourselves to the same
moral level as the original perpetrator of murderous deeds? In the
Elizabethan public theatre, Thomas Kyd began to explore these questions
in The Spanish Tragedy . Shakespeare developed them further in Titus
Andronicus and then refined them to their highest level in Hamlet .</p>
<p>Revenge drama can deal as powerfully with emotional trauma as with
ethical dilemma. Hieronimo in The Spanish Tragedy is driven mad by the
death of his son. In the end his grief becomes so intense that it is
literally inexpressible, causing him to bite out his own tongue.
Shakespeare nods towards Hieronomo when Titus says ‘Or shall we bite our
tongues, and in dumb shows / Pass the remainder of our hateful
days?’</p>
<p>Is it possible to relieve emotional anguish through language? The
attempt to do so is the traditional cathartic function of poetic
tragedy. In Titus , Marcus – the play’s chief ‘spectator’ figure –
confronts the appalling mutilation of his niece, Lavinia, and finds
himself searching for a language of mourning that will ‘ease [her]
misery’. Her father, Titus, later tries to share her pain by holding her
closely to him and comparing her to the weeping wind, himself to first
the sea and then the earth. But even this elemental language is
insufficient. Lavinia’s woes are literally unspeakable . Throughout
Titus , Shakespeare pushes at the boundaries between true expression and
false, sanity and madness, speech and silence.</p>
<p>In particular, he is fascinated by the ways in which the human body
itself can be made to speak. The actor on the Elizabethan stage
communicated with his audience in two ways: through words and through
gestures. Shakespeare began his career as an actor, learning the
elaborate rhetorical speeches and highly formalized physical gestures
that characterized the relatively crude dramatic repertory of the time.
The top box-office star of this period, the early 1590s, was Edward
Alleyn. The first Hieronimo, Alleyn was renowned for his grand style.
Shakespeare, though, quickly saw the dangers of going ‘over the top’ on
stage. Working closely with his leading actor, Richard Burbage, he
sought to develop a much subtler style, in which poetic language became
a medium less for showy display and more for a flexible, inquiring
exploration of the inner life. Titus has its share of windy rhetorical
grandiloquence – that was necessary in order to bring in the crowds. But
its unique brilliance occurs in those passages where Shakespeare
deliberately deprives himself of the dramatist’s usual resources of word
and gesture. Kyd’s Hieronimo only bites himself into silence in the
final scene before his death, whereas Shakespeare’s Lavinia has her
tongue cut out before the halfway mark in the action. For the remainder
of the time, she can speak only in dumb show. Nor can she express
herself with gestures, for her hands have been cut off. She has become a
visual icon of man’s inhumanity to woman. So it is that her father,
Titus, has to ‘wrest an alphabet’ from the ‘martyred signs’ of her
mutilated body.</p>
<p>Titus’ own body has been battered by years of war, and yet he
survives. Shakespeare reminds us that real human beings are not supermen
or action heroes, but vulnerable creatures. Titus is scarred, muddy,
physically made to stoop low, yet he remains high and indomitable in
spirit, despite all the wrongs he has to endure in a cruel world devoid
of divine justice:</p>
<p>Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we,</p>
<p>No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops’ size,</p>
<p>But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,</p>
<p>Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear.</p>
<p>Aaron, meanwhile, is the first great Shakespearean villain, the
forerunner of Richard III, Iago in Othello and Edmund in King Lear . But
he is also the first great black role in English drama. Motivated
throughout by his status as an outsider, at first he seems to be the
devil incarnate. But towards the end, there is an astonishing
turnaround. ‘Is black so base a hue?’ he asks the nurse who has handed
him his first-born son with an insult. Black pride and paternal
affection undo the ancient racist equation of darkness with evil.</p>
<p>Titus Andronicus plays like the work of a very clever, very naughty
schoolboy. In the classroom of the Stratford-upon-Avon grammar school,
young Will would have learnt that the purpose of studying the classics
was to be inspired by their heroic actions and moral virtues. This was
the message of books such as Plutarch’s Lives of the Most Noble Grecians
and Romanes , out of which he would later create his Julius Caesar and
Antony and Cleopatra . But what he also found in classical literature
were glorious tales of blood and gore, not to mention every sex crime
imaginable. The brilliance of Titus is that it is suffused with the
language of the Elizabethan classroom – words like ‘tutor’, ‘instruct’,
‘lesson’ – yet it uses classical literature as ‘pattern and precedent’
not for virtue but for high crime and misdemeanour. The story of the
rape of Philomel by Tereus and her sister Progne’s juicy act of revenge,
as told in Ovid’s Metamorphoses , is explicitly invoked first by
Demetrius and Chiron as the pattern for what they do to Lavinia and then
by Titus as the precedent for what he will do to them. And it is by way
of reference to the actual book of Ovid that the silenced Lavinia
contrives to reveal what has happened.</p>
<p>Again, the lesson of classical literature was that tragedy should be
kept apart from comedy, high art from low. Shakespeare was perfectly
capable of following this precept when he wanted: Julius Caesar probably
has fewer laughs than any other play in the canon. But in Titus, he
wantonly flouts the classical rules. He recognizes that there is
actually a very narrow borderline between tragedy and farce. Four
hundred years before the enfants terribles of modern Hollywood, he saw
that audiences love the shock of the rollercoaster ride from violence to
humour. Jokes are always at someone’s expense and it is one of the
obligations of the serious artist to push at the barrier of good taste
so that we can discover when the expense is so great that we feel
sick.</p>
<p>If the play has a fault, it is that the formality of both language
and action in the opening scenes create a sense of stiffness that
suggests classicism at its most tedious. This is probably not
Shakespeare’s fault: modern scholarship has persuasively demonstrated by
means of close stylistic analysis that Titus Andronicus was begun by
another dramatist, George Peele, who had a high-level classical
education and a taste for large-scale symmetrical stage encounters
spoken in high-flown rhetoric. It is almost certainly Peele who deserves
credit for the play’s ingenious syncretism, its sweep across the
diversity of Roman history. We do not know whether the play was written
as a purposeful collaboration or whether Shakespeare came in to do a
rewrite or to complete an unfinished work. Nor do we know at precisely
what point the writing became his alone – though there is no doubt that
he is the author of all the most dramatic scenes, from the rape through
the hand-chopping to the fly-killing banquet (which was his later
addition, not included in the earliest printed text) to the feast at the
climax.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most profoundly Shakespearean moment – a dramatic move
far beyond the capacity of Peele – comes when Titus is confronted with
the dismembered ruins of his family and his brother Marcus tells him
that it is time to ‘storm’, to rend his hair and explode into a great
tirade of words, to rant in the style of a ham actor. But he does not
cry or curse. He laughs. In times of extremity, you have to throw away
the rulebook. In real life, tragedy and comedy don’t live in different
boxes. William Wordsworth once wrote of thoughts that lie too deep for
tears. Only William Shakespeare could have dramatized the astonishing
but profoundly human idea that the place you get to when you go beyond
tears is not silence but laughter.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>AUTHORSHIP: Mostly by Shakespeare, but the first act and possibly the
beginning of the second and fourth acts have the stylistic marks of
GEORGE PEELE . It is not known whether this was an active collaboration
or whether Shakespeare took over an older play by Peele and revised the
later acts much more thoroughly than the first one. Francis Meres in
1598 and the 1623 Folio editors had no hesitation in attributing the
play to Shakespeare.</p>
<p>PLOT: The brothers Saturninus and Bassianus are in contention for the
Roman emperorship. Titus Andronicus, Rome’s most honoured general,
returns from wars against the Goths with their queen, Tamora, her sons
and her lover, Aaron the Moor, as captives. Her eldest son is sacrificed
by Titus; she vows revenge. Titus is nominated emperor by his brother
Marcus, one of Rome’s tribunes. This Titus declines, instead nominating
Saturninus. To seal the bond of friendship, the new emperor offers to
marry Titus’ daughter Lavinia. She, however, is already pledged to
Bassianus. Saturninus, by now infatuated with Tamora, makes her empress.
Manipulated by Aaron, Tamora’s sons, Chiron and Demetrius, avenge their
mother by raping and mutilating Lavinia, and killing Bassianus. Aaron
falsely implicates two of Titus’ sons in this murder. In his turn Titus
vows revenge and sends his surviving son Lucius to the Goths to raise an
army. Titus achieves his revenge by killing Tamora’s sons and serving
them up to her at a banquet, and then killing her. He himself is killed
by Saturninus and his death avenged by Lucius, who is made emperor.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Titus Andronicus (28%/117/9), Aaron the Moor (14%/57/6), Marcus
Andronicus (12%/63/9), Tamora (10%/49/5), Saturninus (8%/49/5), Lucius
(7%/51/4), Demetrius (4%/39/7), Bassianus (3%/14/3), Lavinia (2%/15/3),
Chiron (2%/30/6), Young Lucius (2%/11/4).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 98% verse, 2% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: 1591/92, perhaps revised 1594? Performed at the Rose in January
1594 and marked by the theatre manager as ‘ne’, possibly meaning ‘new’.
Title page of first published edition, also 1594, seems to imply
performance by three successive companies (see ‘Text’, below),
suggesting staging before theatres were closed due to the plague for the
second half of 1592 and nearly all of 1593. Perhaps the first two
companies performed an old version by Peele and the 1594 performance and
text were newly revised by Shakespeare.</p>
<p>SOURCES: The story is not historical. An anonymous chapbook
narrative, once thought to be the source, is almost certain to be a
derivative text rather than a source, so it must be assumed either that
there is a lost source or that the plot is freely invented, whilst
drawing on a range of Roman materials, both historical and poetic – most
notably the tragedies of Seneca and Ovid’s story of Progne’s revenge on
the tyrant Tereus for the rape of her sister Philomel (Metamorphoses
book 6, used as a prop and plot device in Act 4 scene 1). There is also
a strong influence from other tragedies of the period, notably Thomas
Kyd’s Spanish Tragedy (c.1589, especially for the revenger as a
self-consciously theatrical performer) and Christopher Marlowe’s The Jew
of Malta (c.1591, for Aaron’s delight in his own villainy).</p>
<p>TEXT: published in Quarto as The Most Lamentable Romaine Tragedie of
Titus Andronicus: As it was Plaide by the Right Honourable the Earle of
Darbie, Earle of Pembrooke, and Earle of Sussex their Seruants (1594,
reprinted 1600 and 1611). A good-quality text, perhaps printed from
Shakespeare’s manuscript, though with one or two signs of revision in
the process of composition (some false starts and the possibility that
the killing of both Alarbus and Mutius in the first act were late
additions – could these be Shakespearean revisions to Peele’s
original?). The Second Quarto, which included some good corrections, was
printed from a damaged copy of the First Quarto, resulting in some
changes to the wording of the final scene and the addition of four new
lines at the very end of the play. The Folio text was printed from a
copy of the Third Quarto, incorporating both corrections and errors from
the Second and Third Quartos; it introduced many new errors of its own,
because it was mostly typeset by ‘Compositor E’, the one genuinely
incompetent agent in the creation of the First Folio. The principal
value of the Folio text is that it introduces stage directions,
presumably derived from the theatrical promptbook, and adds one complete
new scene (Act 3 scene 2, the fly-killing banquet). Most modern editions
are based on the First Quarto, but with the banquet inserted from Folio.
In accordance with our practice of beginning from Folio and avoiding the
conflation of discrete texts, we depart from this tradition and edit the
Folio text, though with frequent emendation in places where the text is
erroneous, principally as a result of the shoddy work of ‘Compositor E’.
Since they appear in the Folio, the Second Quarto’s extra four lines at
the end are included, but they are marked with curly brackets to
indicate that they are an addition that seems to derive from the
printing shop rather than the playhouse.</p>
