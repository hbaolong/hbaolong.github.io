<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-3">Scene 2 / running scene 3</h4>
<p>Enter Antipholus [of Syracuse ]</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up</p>
<p>Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful 249 slave 250</p>
<p>Is wand’red forth, in care 251 to seek me out</p>
<p>By computation and mine host’s report 252 .</p>
<p>I could not speak 253 with Dromio since at first</p>
<p>I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.</p>
<p>Enter Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p>How now, sir, is your merry humour altered?</p>
<p>As you love strokes 254 , so jest with me again.</p>
<p>You know no Centaur? You received no gold?</p>
<p>Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?</p>
<p>My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,</p>
<p>That thus so madly thou didst answer me?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE What answer, sir? When spake I 255 such a
word?</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Even now, even here, not half an hour
since.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I did not see you since you sent me hence</p>
<p>Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Villain, thou didst deny the gold’s receipt
256 ,</p>
<p>And told’st me of a mistress and a dinner,</p>
<p>For which I hope thou felt’st 257 I was displeased.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I am glad to see you in this merry vein 258 :</p>
<p>What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth
259 ?</p>
<p>Think’st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.</p>
<p>Beats Dromio</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Hold, sir, for God’s sake! Now your jest is
earnest 260 ,</p>
<p>Upon what bargain do you give it me?</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Because that I familiarly sometimes</p>
<p>Do use you for 261 my fool 262 and chat with you,</p>
<p>Your sauciness 263 will jest upon 264 my love,</p>
<p>And make a common of my serious hours 265 .</p>
<p>When the sun shines, let foolish gnats make sport 266 ,</p>
<p>But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.</p>
<p>If you will jest with me, know my aspect 267 ,</p>
<p>And fashion 268 your demeanour 269 to my looks,</p>
<p>Or I will beat this method in your sconce 270 .</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Sconce call you it? So 271 you would leave
battering 272 , I had rather have it a head. An 273 you use these blows
long 274 , I must get a sconce 275 for my head and ensconce 276 it too,
or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders 277 . But I pray, sir, why
am I beaten?</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Dost thou not know?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Shall I tell you why?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Ay, sir, and wherefore 278 ; for they say every
why hath a wherefore.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Why, first, for flouting me, and then,
wherefore, for urging 279 it the second time to me.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season
280 ,</p>
<p>When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason?</p>
<p>Well, sir, I thank you.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thank me, sir, for what?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry 281 , sir, for this something that you gave
me for nothing 282 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I’ll make you amends next, to give 283 you
nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No, sir, I think the meat wants that 284 I
have.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE In good time 285 , sir. What’s that?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Basting 286 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Well, sir, then ’twill be dry.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Your reason?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Lest it make you choleric 287 and purchase me
another dry 288 basting.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Well, sir, learn to jest in good time 289 .
There’s a time for all things.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I durst have denied 290 that before you were so
choleric.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE By what rule 291 , sir?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
pate of Father Time 292 himself.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Let’s hear it.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that
grows bald by nature.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE May he not do it by fine and recovery 293
?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Yes, to pay a fine 294 for a periwig 295 and
recover the lost hair 296 of another man.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Why is Time such a niggard 297 of hair, being,
as it is, so plentiful an excrement 298 ?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Because it is a blessing that he bestows on
beasts, and what he hath scanted 299 men in hair 300 , he hath given
them in wit.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair
than wit.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his
hair.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain
dealers 301 without wit.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE The plainer dealer 302 , the sooner lost; yet he
loseth it in a kind of jollity 303 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE For what reason?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE For two 304 , and sound 305 ones too.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Nay, not sound, I pray you.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Sure 306 ones, then.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Nay, not sure in a thing falsing 307 .</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Certain 308 ones then.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Name them.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE The one, to save the money that he spends in
tiring 309 : the other, that at dinner they 310 should not drop in his
porridge 311 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE You would all this time have proved there is
no time for all things.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry, and did, sir: namely, in no time to recover
hair lost by nature.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE But your reason was not substantial 312 , why
there is no time to recover.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Thus I mend 313 it: Time himself is bald 314 , and
therefore to the world’s end will have bald followers.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I knew ’twould be a bald conclusion — but
soft, who wafts 315 us yonder?</p>
<p>Enter Adriana [beckoning ] and Luciana</p>
<p>ADRIANA Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange 316 and frown,</p>
<p>Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects 317 .</p>
<p>I am not Adriana nor thy wife.</p>
<p>The time was once when thou unurged 318 wouldst vow</p>
<p>That never words were music to thine ear,</p>
<p>That never object pleasing in thine eye,</p>
<p>That never touch well welcome to thy hand,</p>
<p>That never meat sweet-savoured in thy taste,</p>
<p>Unless I spake or looked or touched or carved 319 to thee.</p>
<p>How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,</p>
<p>That thou art then estrangèd 320 from thyself ?</p>
<p>Thy self I call it, being strange to me,</p>
<p>That, undividable, incorporate 321 ,</p>
<p>Am better than thy dear self ’s better part 322 .</p>
<p>Ah, do not tear away thyself from me,</p>
<p>For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall 323</p>
<p>A drop of water in the breaking gulf 324 ,</p>
<p>And take unmingled thence that drop again</p>
<p>Without addition or diminishing,</p>
<p>As take from me thyself, and not me too 325 .</p>
<p>How dearly 326 would it touch thee to the quick 327</p>
<p>Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious,</p>
<p>And that this body, consecrate 328 to thee,</p>
<p>By ruffian lust should be contaminate?</p>
<p>Wouldst thou not spit at me, and spurn 329 at me,</p>
<p>And hurl the name of ‘husband’ in my face,</p>
<p>And tear the stained 330 skin of my harlot brow,</p>
<p>And from my false 331 hand cut the wedding ring,</p>
<p>And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?</p>
<p>I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it 332 .</p>
<p>I am possessed with 333 an adulterate 334 blot,</p>
<p>My blood is mingled 335 with the crime of lust.</p>
<p>For if we two be one, and thou play false,</p>
<p>I do digest the poison of thy flesh,</p>
<p>Being strumpeted 336 by thy contagion.</p>
<p>Keep then fair league 337 and truce with thy true bed,</p>
<p>I live distained 338 , thou undishonourèd.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you
not:</p>
<p>In Ephesus I am but two hours old,</p>
<p>As strange unto your town as to your talk,</p>
<p>Who 339 , every word by all my wit being scanned 340 ,</p>
<p>Wants wit in all one word to understand 341 .</p>
<p>LUCIANA Fie, brother 342 , how the world is changed with you.</p>
<p>When were you wont 343 to use my sister thus?</p>
<p>She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE By Dromio?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE By me?</p>
<p>ADRIANA By thee, and this thou didst return 344 from him,</p>
<p>That he did buffet 345 thee and in his blows</p>
<p>Denied my house for 346 his, me for his wife.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Did you converse, sir, with this
gentlewoman?</p>
<p>What is the course and drift 347 of your compact 348 ?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I, sir? I never saw her till this time.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Villain, thou liest, for even her very
words</p>
<p>Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I never spake with her in all my life.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE How can she thus then call us by our
names?</p>
<p>Unless it be by inspiration 349 .</p>
<p>ADRIANA How ill agrees it 350 with your gravity 351</p>
<p>To counterfeit 352 thus grossly 353 with your slave,</p>
<p>Abetting 354 him to thwart me in my mood 355 .</p>
<p>Be it my wrong you are from me exempt 356 ,</p>
<p>But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt 357 .</p>
<p>Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:</p>
<p>Clings to his sleeve</p>
<p>Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,</p>
<p>Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state 358 ,</p>
<p>Makes me with thy strength to communicate 359 .</p>
<p>If aught possess 360 thee from me, it is dross 361 ,</p>
<p>Usurping ivy, brier 362 , or idle 363 moss,</p>
<p>Who all for want of pruning, with intrusion 364 ,</p>
<p>Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion 365 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE To me she speaks, she moves me for her theme
366 ;</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>What, was I married to her in my dream?</p>
<p>Or sleep I now, and think I hear all this?</p>
<p>What error 367 drives our eyes and ears amiss?</p>
<p>Until I know this sure uncertainty 368 ,</p>
<p>I’ll entertain 369 the offered fallacy 370 .</p>
<p>LUCIANA Dromio, go bid the servants spread 371 for dinner.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O, for my beads 372 , I cross me 373 for 374 a
sinner.</p>
<p>Crosses himself</p>
<p>This is the fairy land. O spite of spites,</p>
<p>We talk with goblins, owls 375 and sprites 376 ;</p>
<p>If we obey them not, this will ensue:</p>
<p>They’ll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue.</p>
<p>LUCIANA Why prat’st thou 377 to thyself and answer’st not?</p>
<p>Dromio, thou Dromio, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot 378 .</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I am transformèd 379 , master, am I not?</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I think thou art in mind, and so am I.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thou hast thine own form.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No, I am an ape 380 .</p>
<p>LUCIANA If thou art changed to aught 381 , ’tis to an ass.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE ’Tis true, she rides 382 me and I long for grass
383 .</p>
<p>’Tis so, I am an ass, else it could never be</p>
<p>But I should know her as well as she knows me.</p>
<p>ADRIANA Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,</p>
<p>To put the finger in the eye and weep 384 ,</p>
<p>Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn 385 .</p>
<p>Come, sir, to dinner.— Dromio, keep 386 the gate.—</p>
<p>Husband, I’ll dine above 387 with you today,</p>
<p>And shrive 388 you of a thousand idle pranks.—</p>
<p>Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,</p>
<p>Say he dines forth 389 , and let no creature enter.—</p>
<p>Come, sister.— Dromio, play the porter well.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Sleeping or waking, mad or well-advised 390 ?</p>
<p>Known unto these and to myself disguised?</p>
<p>I’ll say as they say, and persever 391 so,</p>
<p>And in this mist at all adventures go 392 .</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Master, shall I be porter at the gate?</p>
<p>ADRIANA Ay, and let none enter, lest I break your pate.</p>
<p>LUCIANA Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Dromio of Syracuse remains as porter</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
