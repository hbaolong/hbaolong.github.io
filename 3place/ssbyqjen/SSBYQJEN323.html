13</h4>
<p>Enter Ajax, armed, Achilles, Patroclus, Agamemnon, Menelaus, Ulysses,
Nestor, Calchas and others</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Here art thou in appointment 1818 fresh and fair,</p>
<p>Anticipating 1819 time. With starting 1820 courage,</p>
<p>Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,</p>
<p>Thou dreadful Ajax, that the appallèd 1821 air</p>
<p>May pierce the head of the great combatant</p>
<p>And hale 1822 him hither.</p>
<p>AJAX Thou, trumpet 1823 , there’s my purse.</p>
<p>Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen 1824 pipe:</p>
<p>Blow, villain 1825 , till thy spherèd 1826 bias 1827 cheek</p>
<p>Outswell the colic 1828 of puffed Aquilon 1829 .</p>
<p>Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood 1830 .</p>
<p>Thou blowest for 1831 Hector.</p>
<p>Trumpet sounds</p>
<p>ULYSSES No trumpet answers.</p>
<p>ACHILLES ’Tis but early days 1832 .</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Is not yond 1833 Diomed, with Calchas’ daughter?</p>
<p>ULYSSES ’Tis he, I ken 1834 the manner of his gait 1835 ,</p>
<p>He rises on the toe: that spirit of his</p>
<p>In aspiration 1836 lifts him from the earth.</p>
<p>[Enter Diomedes and Cressida ]</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Is this the lady Cressid?</p>
<p>DIOMEDES Even she.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Most dearly 1837 welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.</p>
<p>Kisses her</p>
<p>NESTOR Our general doth salute you with a kiss.</p>
<p>ULYSSES Yet 1838 is the kindness but particular 1839 ;</p>
<p>’Twere better she were kissed in general 1840 .</p>
<p>NESTOR And very courtly 1841 counsel: I’ll begin.</p>
<p>Kisses her</p>
<p>So much for Nestor.</p>
<p>ACHILLES I’ll take that winter 1842 from your lips, fair lady:</p>
<p>Achilles bids you welcome.</p>
<p>Kisses her</p>
<p>MENELAUS I had good argument 1843 for kissing once.</p>
<p>PATROCLUS But that’s no argument 1844 for kissing now;</p>
<p>For thus popped 1845 Paris in his hardiment 1846 .</p>
<p>Kisses her</p>
<p>ULYSSES O, deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns 1847 ,</p>
<p>For which we lose our heads 1848 to gild his horns 1849 .</p>
<p>PATROCLUS The first was Menelaus’ kiss, this, mine:</p>
<p>Patroclus kisses you.</p>
<p>Kisses her again</p>
<p>MENELAUS O, this is trim 1850 !</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Paris and I kiss evermore for 1851 him.</p>
<p>MENELAUS I’ll have my kiss, sir.— Lady, by your leave 1852 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA In kissing, do you render 1853 or receive?</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Both take and give.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA I’ll make my match to live 1854 ,</p>
<p>The kiss you take 1855 is better than you give:</p>
<p>Therefore no kiss.</p>
<p>MENELAUS I’ll give you boot 1856 , I’ll give you three for one.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA You are an odd 1857 man: give even 1858 or give none.</p>
<p>MENELAUS An odd 1859 man, lady? Every man is odd 1860 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA No, Paris is not; for you know ’tis true</p>
<p>That you are odd and he is even 1861 with you.</p>
<p>MENELAUS You fillip 1862 me o’th’head 1863 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA No, I’ll be sworn.</p>
<p>ULYSSES It were no match 1864 , your nail 1865 against his horn 1866
.</p>
<p>May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?</p>
<p>CRESSIDA You may.</p>
<p>ULYSSES I do desire 1867 it.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Why, beg then.</p>
<p>ULYSSES Why then for Venus’ sake, give me a kiss,</p>
<p>When Helen is a maid 1868 again, and his 1869 —</p>
<p>CRESSIDA I am your debtor, claim it when ’tis due 1870 .</p>
<p>ULYSSES Never’s my day, and then a kiss 1871 of you.</p>
<p>DIOMEDES Lady, a word: I’ll bring you to your father.</p>
<p>NESTOR A woman of quick sense 1872 .</p>
<p>ULYSSES Fie 1873 , fie upon her!</p>
<p>There’s a language in her eye, her cheek, her lip;</p>
<p>Nay, her foot speaks, her wanton 1874 spirits 1875 look out</p>
<p>At every joint and motive 1876 of her body.</p>
<p>O, these encounterers 1877 , so glib of tongue,</p>
<p>That give a coasting welcome ere it comes 1878 ,</p>
<p>And wide unclasp 1879 the tables 1880 of their thoughts</p>
<p>To every tickling 1881 reader! Set them down 1882</p>
<p>For sluttish spoils of opportunity 1883</p>
<p>And daughters of the game 1884 .</p>
<p>Exeunt [Diomedes and Cressida ]</p>
<p>Enter all of Troy: Hector, Paris, Aeneas, Helenus and Attendants.
Flourish</p>
<p>ALL The Trojans’ trumpet.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Yonder comes the troop.</p>
<p>AENEAS Hail, all you state 1885 of Greece. What 1886 shall be
done</p>
<p>To him that victory commands 1887 ? Or do you purpose 1888</p>
<p>A victor shall be known 1889 ? Will you 1890 the knights</p>
<p>Shall to the edge of all extremit 1891 y</p>
<p>Pursue each other, or shall be divided</p>
<p>By any voice or order of the field 1892 ?</p>
<p>Hector bade 1893 ask.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Which way would Hector have it?</p>
<p>AENEAS He cares not: he’ll obey conditions 1894 .</p>
<p>ACHILLES ’Tis done like Hector, but securely 1895 done,</p>
<p>A little proudly, and great deal disprizing 1896</p>
<p>The knight opposed.</p>
<p>AENEAS If not Achilles, sir, what is your name?</p>
<p>ACHILLES If not Achilles, nothing.</p>
<p>AENEAS Therefore Achilles. But whate’er know this:</p>
<p>In the extremity of great and little,</p>
<p>Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector 1897 ;</p>
<p>The one 1898 almost as infinite as all 1899 ,</p>
<p>The other 1900 blank 1901 as nothing. Weigh 1902 him well,</p>
<p>And that which looks like pride is courtesy.</p>
<p>This Ajax is half made of Hector’s blood 1903 ,</p>
<p>In love whereof, half Hector stays at home:</p>
<p>Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek</p>
<p>This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.</p>
<p>ACHILLES A maiden 1904 battle, then? O, I perceive 1905 you.</p>
<p>[Enter Diomedes ]</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle 1906 knight,</p>
<p>Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord Aeneas</p>
<p>Consent upon the order 1907 of their fight,</p>
<p>So be it, either to the uttermost 1908 ,</p>
<p>Or else a breath 1909 . The combatants being kin</p>
<p>Half stints 1910 their strife 1911 before their strokes begin.</p>
<p>Ajax and Hector enter the lists 1912</p>
<p>ULYSSES They are opposed 1913 already.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy 1914 ?</p>
<p>ULYSSES The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,</p>
<p>// They call him Troilus: //</p>
<p>Not yet mature, yet matchless 1915 , firm of word 1916 ,</p>
<p>Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue 1917 ;</p>
<p>Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calmed;</p>
<p>His heart and hand both open and both free 1918 ,</p>
<p>For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;</p>
<p>Yet gives he not till judgement guide his bounty 1919 ,</p>
<p>Nor dignifies an impare 1920 thought with breath:</p>
<p>Manly as Hector, but more dangerous,</p>
<p>For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes 1921</p>
<p>To tender objects 1922 , but he in heat of action</p>
<p>Is more vindicative 1923 than jealous love.</p>
<p>They call him Troilus, and on him erect</p>
<p>A second hope as fairly built as Hector 1924 .</p>
<p>Thus says Aeneas, one that knows the youth</p>
<p>Even to his inches 1925 , and with private soul 1926</p>
<p>Did in great Ilium thus translate 1927 him to me.</p>
<p>Alarum 1928</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON They are in action 1929 .</p>
<p>Hector and Ajax fight</p>
<p>NESTOR Now, Ajax, hold thine own!</p>
<p>TROILUS Hector, thou sleep’st: awake thee!</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON His blows are well disposed 1930 . There, Ajax!</p>
<p>DIOMEDES You must no more 1931 .</p>
<p>Trumpets cease</p>
<p>AENEAS Princes, enough, so 1932 please you.</p>
<p>AJAX I am not warm 1933 yet: let us fight again.</p>
<p>DIOMEDES As Hector pleases.</p>
<p>HECTOR Why, then will I no more:</p>
<p>Thou art, great lord, my father’s sister’s son,</p>
<p>A cousin-german 1934 to great Priam’s seed.</p>
<p>The obligation of our blood forbids</p>
<p>A gory emulation 1935 ’twixt us twain:</p>
<p>Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan 1936 so</p>
<p>That thou couldst say ’This hand is Grecian all,</p>
<p>And this is Trojan: the sinews of this leg</p>
<p>All Greek, and this all Troy: my mother’s blood</p>
<p>Runs on the dexter 1937 cheek, and this sinister 1938</p>
<p>Bounds in 1939 my father’s’, by Jove multipotent 1940 ,</p>
<p>Thou shouldst not bear 1941 from me a Greekish member 1942</p>
<p>Wherein my sword had not impressure 1943 made</p>
<p>Of our rank 1944 feud 1945 . But the just gods gainsay 1946</p>
<p>That any drop thou borrowed’st from thy mother,</p>
<p>My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword</p>
<p>Be drained! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:</p>
<p>By him that thunders 1947 , thou hast lusty 1948 arms;</p>
<p>Hector would have them fall upon him thus.</p>
<p>Cousin, all honour to thee!</p>
<p>Embraces him</p>
<p>AJAX I thank thee, Hector.</p>
<p>Thou art too gentle 1949 and too free 1950 a man:</p>
<p>I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence</p>
<p>A great addition 1951 earnèd in thy death.</p>
<p>HECTOR Not Neoptolemus 1952 so mirable 1953 ,</p>
<p>On whose bright crest 1954 Fame with her loud’st ‘Oyez’</p>
<p>Cries ‘This is he’, couldst promise to himself</p>
<p>A thought of added honour torn from Hector 1955 .</p>
<p>AENEAS There is expectance 1956 here from both the sides,</p>
<p>What further you will do.</p>
<p>HECTOR We’ll answer it:</p>
<p>The issue 1957 is embracement. Ajax, farewell.</p>
<p>Embraces Ajax</p>
<p>AJAX If I might in entreaties find success —</p>
<p>As seld 1958 I have the chance 1959 — I would desire 1960</p>
<p>My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.</p>
<p>DIOMEDES ’Tis Agamemnon’s wish, and great Achilles</p>
<p>Doth long to see unarmed the valiant Hector.</p>
<p>HECTOR Aeneas, call my brother Troilus to me,</p>
<p>And signify 1961 this loving interview</p>
<p>To the expecters of our Trojan part 1962 :</p>
<p>Desire them 1963 home.— Give me thy hand, my cousin,</p>
<p>To Ajax</p>
<p>I will go eat with thee and see your knights.</p>
<p>Agamemnon and the rest [come forward ]</p>
<p>AJAX Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.</p>
<p>HECTOR The worthiest of them tell me name by name:</p>
<p>To Aeneas</p>
<p>But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes</p>
<p>Shall find him by his large and portly 1964 size.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Worthy of arms 1965 , as welcome as to one 1966</p>
<p>That would be rid of such an enemy —</p>
<p>But that’s no welcome 1967 : understand more clear,</p>
<p>What’s past and what’s to come is strewed with husks</p>
<p>And formless ruin of oblivion,</p>
<p>But in this extant 1968 moment, faith and troth 1969 ,</p>
<p>Strained purely 1970 from all hollow 1971 bias-drawing 1972 ,</p>
<p>Bids thee, with most divine integrity,</p>
<p>From heart of very heart 1973 , great Hector, welcome.</p>
<p>HECTOR I thank thee, most imperious 1974 Agamemnon.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON My well-famed lord of Troy, no less to you.</p>
<p>To Troilus</p>
<p>MENELAUS Let me confirm my princely brother’s greeting:</p>
<p>You brace 1975 of warlike brothers, welcome hither.</p>
<p>HECTOR Who must we answer 1976 ?</p>
<p>AENEAS The noble Menelaus.</p>
<p>HECTOR O, you, my lord? By Mars his gauntlet 1977 , thanks!</p>
<p>Mock not, that I affect 1978 th’untraded 1979 oath:</p>
<p>Your quondam 1980 wife swears still by Venus’ glove 1981 .</p>
<p>She’s well, but bade me not 1982 commend her to you.</p>
<p>MENELAUS Name her not now, sir: she’s a deadly theme 1983 .</p>
<p>HECTOR O, pardon: I offend.</p>
<p>NESTOR I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft,</p>
<p>Labouring for destiny 1984 , make cruel way</p>
<p>Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,</p>
<p>As hot 1985 as Perseus 1986 , spur thy Phrygian steed 1987 ,</p>
<p>And seen thee scorning forfeits and subduements 1988 ,</p>
<p>When thou hast hung 1989 thy advancèd 1990 sword i’th’air,</p>
<p>Not letting it decline on the declined 1991 ,</p>
<p>That 1992 I have said unto my standers-by,</p>
<p>‘Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!’</p>
<p>And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,</p>
<p>When that a ring of Greeks have hemmed thee in,</p>
<p>Like an Olympian 1993 wrestling. This have I seen,</p>
<p>But this thy countenance, still 1994 locked in steel 1995 ,</p>
<p>I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,</p>
<p>And once fought with him: he was a soldier good,</p>
<p>But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,</p>
<p>Never like thee. Let an old man embrace thee,</p>
<p>And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.</p>
<p>AENEAS ’Tis the old Nestor.</p>
<p>HECTOR Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle 1996 ,</p>
<p>That hast so long walked hand in hand with time:</p>
<p>Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp 1997 thee.</p>
<p>NESTOR I would my arms 1998 could match thee in contention 1999 ,</p>
<p>As they contend 2000 with thee in courtesy.</p>
<p>HECTOR I would they could.</p>
<p>NESTOR Ha?</p>
<p>By this white beard, I’d fight with thee tomorrow.</p>
<p>Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time 2001 .</p>
<p>ULYSSES I wonder now how yonder city stands</p>
<p>When we have here her base and pillar 2002 by us.</p>
<p>HECTOR I know your favour 2003 , Lord Ulysses, well.</p>
<p>Ah, sir, there’s many a Greek and Trojan dead,</p>
<p>Since first I saw yourself and Diomed</p>
<p>In Ilium, on your Greekish embassy 2004 .</p>
<p>ULYSSES Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:</p>
<p>My prophecy is but half his journey yet 2005 ;</p>
<p>For yonder walls, that pertly 2006 front your town,</p>
<p>Yond towers, whose wanton 2007 tops do buss 2008 the clouds,</p>
<p>Must kiss their own feet.</p>
<p>HECTOR I must not believe you: There they stand yet, and modestly
2009 I think,</p>
<p>The fall of every Phrygian 2010 stone will cost</p>
<p>A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all 2011 ,</p>
<p>And that old common arbitrator 2012 , Time,</p>
<p>Will one day end it.</p>
<p>ULYSSES So to him 2013 we leave it.</p>
<p>Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:</p>
<p>After the general, I beseech you next</p>
<p>To feast with me and see me at my tent.</p>
<p>ACHILLES I shall forestall 2014 thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!</p>
<p>Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee,</p>
<p>I have with exact 2015 view perused 2016 thee, Hector,</p>
<p>And quoted 2017 joint 2018 by joint.</p>
<p>HECTOR Is this Achilles?</p>
<p>ACHILLES I am Achilles.</p>
<p>HECTOR Stand fair 2019 , I prithee: let me look on thee.</p>
<p>ACHILLES Behold thy fill.</p>
<p>HECTOR Nay, I have done already.</p>
<p>ACHILLES Thou art too brief: I will the second time,</p>
<p>As 2020 I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.</p>
<p>HECTOR O, like a book of sport 2021 thou’lt read me o’er:</p>
<p>But there’s more in me than thou understand’st.</p>
<p>Why dost thou so oppress 2022 me with thine eye?</p>
<p>ACHILLES Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body</p>
<p>Shall I destroy him? Whether there, or there, or there.</p>
<p>Points</p>
<p>That I may give the local 2023 wound a name</p>
<p>And make distinct 2024 the very breach whereout</p>
<p>Hector’s great spirit 2025 flew 2026 . Answer me, heavens!</p>
<p>HECTOR It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,</p>
<p>To answer such a question. Stand again 2027 ;</p>
<p>Think’st thou to catch 2028 my life so pleasantly 2029</p>
<p>As to prenominate 2030 in nice 2031 conjecture 2032</p>
<p>Where thou wilt hit me dead?</p>
<p>ACHILLES I tell thee, yea.</p>
<p>HECTOR Wert thou the oracle to tell me so,</p>
<p>I’d not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well,</p>
<p>For I’ll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there,</p>
<p>But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm 2033 ,</p>
<p>I’ll kill thee everywhere, yea, o’er and o’er.</p>
<p>You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag:</p>
<p>His insolence draws folly from my lips,</p>
<p>But I’ll endeavour deeds to match these words,</p>
<p>Or may I never—</p>
<p>AJAX Do not chafe thee 2034 , cousin:</p>
<p>And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,</p>
<p>Till accident 2035 or purpose bring you to’t 2036 .</p>
<p>You may every day enough of Hector</p>
<p>If you have stomach 2037 . The general state 2038 , I fear,</p>
<p>Can scarce entreat 2039 you to be odd 2040 with him.</p>
<p>HECTOR I pray you let us see you in the field:</p>
<p>We have had pelting 2041 wars, since you refused 2042</p>
<p>The Grecians’ cause.</p>
<p>ACHILLES Dost thou entreat me, Hector?</p>
<p>Tomorrow do I meet thee, fell 2043 as death:</p>
<p>Tonight all friends.</p>
<p>HECTOR Thy hand upon that match 2044 .</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON First, all you peers 2045 of Greece, go to my tent:</p>
<p>There in 2046 the full convive you 2047 . Afterwards,</p>
<p>As Hector’s leisure and your bounties 2048 shall</p>
<p>Concur together, severally 2049 entreat 2050 him.</p>
<p>Beat loud the taborins 2051 , let the trumpets blow,</p>
<p>That this great soldier may his welcome know.</p>
<p>Exeunt. [Troilus and Ulysses remain ]</p>
<p>TROILUS My lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,</p>
<p>In what place of the field doth Calchas keep 2052 ?</p>
<p>ULYSSES At Menelaus’ tent, most princely Troilus:</p>
<p>There Diomed doth feast with him tonight,</p>
<p>Who neither looks on heaven nor on earth,</p>
<p>But gives all gaze and bent 2053 of amorous view</p>
<p>On the fair Cressid.</p>
<p>TROILUS Shall I, sweet lord, be bound 2054 to thee so much,</p>
<p>After we part from Agamemnon’s tent,</p>
<p>To bring me thither?</p>
<p>ULYSSES You shall command me, sir.</p>
<p>As gentle 2055 tell me, of what honour 2056 was</p>
<p>This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there</p>
<p>That wails her absence?</p>
<p>TROILUS O, sir, to such as 2057 boasting show their scars 2058</p>
<p>A mock 2059 is due.Will you walk on, my lord?</p>
<p>She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth 2060 :</p>
<p>But still 2061 sweet love is food for fortune’s tooth 2062 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
