<h4 id="scene-2-191-running-scene-2">Scene 2 191 ／ running scene 2</h4>
<p>Enter Falstaff and Page</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Sirrah 192 , you giant 193 , what says the doctor to my
water 194 ?</p>
<p>PAGE He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy water, but,
for the party that owed 195 it, he might have more diseases than he knew
for 196 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at 197 me. The brain
of this foolish-compounded 198 clay, man, is not able to invent anything
that tends to laughter, more than I invent or is invented on me. I am
not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men. I do
here walk before thee like a sow that hath o’erwhelmed 199 all her
litter but one. If the prince put thee into my service for any other
reason than to set me off 200 , why then I have no judgement. Thou
whoreson 201 mandrake 202 , thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to
wait at my heels. I was never manned with 203 an agate 204 till now: but
I will set you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send
you back again to your master, for a jewel 205 — the juvenal 206 , the
prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledged 207 . I will sooner
have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his
cheek, yet he will not stick 208 to say his face is a face-royal 209 .
Heaven may finish it when he will, it is not a hair amiss 210 yet. He
may keep it 211 still at a face-royal, for a barber shall never earn
sixpence out of it; and yet he will be crowing as if he had writ 212 man
ever since his father was a bachelor. He may keep his own grace 213 ,
but he is almost out of mine, I can assure him. What said Master
Dombledon 214 about the satin for my short cloak and slops 215 ?</p>
<p>PAGE He said, sir, you should procure him better assurance 216 than
Bardolph 217 : he would not take his bond and yours. He liked not the
security.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Let him be damned, like the glutton! May his tongue be
hotter 218 ! A whoreson Achitophel 219 ! A rascally yea-forsooth 220
knave, to bear a gentleman in hand 221 , and then stand 222 upon
security! The whoreson smooth-pates 223 do now wear nothing but high 224
shoes, and bunches of keys at their girdles 225 . And if a man is
through with them in honest taking up 226 , then they must stand upon
security. I had as lief 227 they would put ratsbane 228 in my mouth as
offer to stop it with security. I looked 229 he should have sent me two
and twenty yards of satin, as I am true knight, and he sends me
security. Well, he may sleep in security, for he hath the horn of
abundance 230 , and the lightness 231 of his wife shines through it, and
yet cannot he see, though he have his own lanthorn 232 to light him.
Where’s Bardolph?</p>
<p>PAGE He’s gone into Smithfield 233 to buy your worship a horse.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I bought him in Paul’s 234 , and he’ll buy me a horse in
Smithfield. If I could get me a wife in the stews 235 , I were manned,
horsed, and wived.</p>
<p>Enter Chief Justice and Servant</p>
<p>PAGE Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed 236 the prince for
striking him about Bardolph 237 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Wait, close 238 . I will not see him 239 .</p>
<p>Tries to sneak away</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE What’s he that goes there?</p>
<p>SERVANT Falstaff, an’t 240 please your lordship.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE He that was in question for 241 the robbery?</p>
<p>SERVANT He, my lord. But he hath since done good service 242 at
Shrewsbury, and, as I hear, is now going with some charge 243 to the
lord John of Lancaster.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE What, to York? Call him back again.</p>
<p>SERVANT Sir John Falstaff!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Boy, tell him I am deaf.</p>
<p>PAGE You must speak louder: my master is deaf.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE I am sure he is, to the hearing of anything good.
Go, pluck him by the elbow, I must speak with him.</p>
<p>SERVANT Sir John!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What? A young knave, and beg? Is there not wars 244 ? Is
there not employment? Doth not the king lack subjects? Do not the rebels
want 245 soldiers? Though it 246 be a shame to be on any side but one,
it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side, were it 247 worse
than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it.</p>
<p>SERVANT You mistake me, sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? Setting my
knighthood and my soldiership aside 248 , I had lied in my throat 249 ,
if I had said so.</p>
<p>SERVANT I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and your
soldiership aside, and give me leave to tell you, you lie in your throat
if you say I am any other than an honest man.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I give thee leave to tell me so? I lay aside that which
grows to 250 me? If thou gett’st any leave of me, hang me: if thou
tak’st leave, thou wert better be hanged. You hunt counter 251 , hence!
Avaunt! 252</p>
<p>SERVANT Sir, my lord would speak with you.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My good lord! Give your lordship good time of the day. I am
glad to see your lordship abroad 253 . I heard say your lordship was
sick. I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice 254 . Your lordship,
though not clean past your youth, hath yet some smack 255 of age in you,
some relish 256 of the saltness 257 of time, and I most humbly beseech
your lordship to have a reverend 258 care of your health.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to
Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF If it please your lordship, I hear his majesty is returned
with some discomfort from Wales.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when
I sent for you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into this same
whoreson apoplexy 259 .</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Well, heaven mend him! I pray, let me speak with
you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy, a
sleeping of the blood, a whoreson tingling.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE What 260 tell you me of it? Be it as it is.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF It hath it original 261 from much grief, from study and
perturbation of the brain. I have read the cause of his effects in Galen
262 : it is a kind of deafness.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE I think you are fallen into the disease, for you
hear not what I say to you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Very well, my lord, very well. Rather, an’t please you, it
is the disease of not listening, the malady of not marking 263 , that I
am troubled withal 264 .</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE To punish you by the heels 265 would amend the
attention of your ears, and I care not if I be your physician.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I am as poor as Job 266 , my lord, but not so patient: your
lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of
poverty 267 , but how 268 I should be your patient to follow your
prescriptions, the wise may make some dram 269 of a scruple 270 , or
indeed a scruple itself 271 .</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE I sent for you, when there were matters against
you for your life 272 , to come speak with me.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of
this land-service 273 , I did not come.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great
infamy.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less 274 .</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Your means 275 is very slender, and your waste 276
great.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I would it were otherwise: I would my means were greater,
and my waist slenderer.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE You have misled the youthful prince.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF The young prince hath misled me. I am the fellow with the
great belly, and he my dog 277 .</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Well, I am loath to gall 278 a new-healed wound:
your day’s service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night’s
exploit on Gad’s Hill 279 . You may thank the unquiet 280 time for your
quiet o’er-posting that action 281 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My lord?</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a
sleeping wolf.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox 282 .</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE What? You are as a candle, the better 283 part
burnt out.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF A wassail candle 284 , my lord, all tallow 285 : if I did
say of wax 286 , my growth would approve 287 the truth.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE There is not a white hair on your face but should
have his 288 effect of gravity.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF His effect of gravy 289 , gravy, gravy.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE You follow the young prince up and down, like his
evil angel 290 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Not so, my lord, your ill angel is light 291 : but I hope he
that looks upon me will take me without weighing 292 . And yet, in some
respects, I grant, I cannot go 293 : I cannot tell 294 . Virtue is of so
little regard in these costermongers 295 that true valour is turned
bear-herd 296 : pregnancy 297 is made a tapster 298 , and hath his quick
wit wasted in giving reckonings 299 : all the other gifts appertinent
300 to man — as the malice of this age shapes them — are not worth a
gooseberry. You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are
young. You measure the heat of our livers 301 with the bitterness of
your galls 302 . And we that are in the vaward 303 of our youth, I must
confess, are wags 304 too.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,
that are written down old with all the characters 305 of age? Have you
not a moist 306 eye? A dry hand? A yellow cheek? A white beard? A
decreasing leg? An increasing belly? Is not your voice broken 307 ? Your
wind short? Your wit single 308 ? And every part about you blasted 309
with antiquity? And will you call yourself young? Fie 310 , fie, fie,
Sir John.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My lord, I was born with a white head and something a round
belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing 311 and singing of
anthems. To approve 312 my youth further, I will not. The truth is, I am
only old in judgement and understanding, and he that will caper with 313
me for a thousand marks 314 , let him lend me the money, and have at him
315 ! For 316 the box of th’ear that the prince gave you, he gave it
like a rude 317 prince, and you took it like a sensible 318 lord. I have
checked 319 him for it, and the young lion repents; marry 320 , not in
ashes and sackcloth 321 , but in new silk and old sack 322 .</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Well, heaven send the prince a better
companion!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Heaven send the companion a better prince! I cannot rid my
hands of him.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry.
I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the archbishop
and the Earl of Northumberland.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Yes, I thank your pretty sweet wit for it 323 . But look you
324 pray — all you that kiss my lady Peace at home — that our armies
join not in a hot day, for if I take but two shirts out with me, and I
mean not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day, if I brandish
anything but my bottle, would I might never spit white 325 again. There
is not a dangerous action 326 can peep out his head but I am thrust upon
it. Well, I cannot last ever.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Well, be honest 327 , be honest, and heaven bless
your expedition.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me
forth 328 ?</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Not a penny, not a penny. You are too impatient to
bear crosses 329 . Fare you well. Commend me to my cousin
Westmorland.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Lord Chief Justice and Servant ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF If I do, fillip 330 me with a three-man beetle 331 . A man
can no more separate age and covetousness than he can part young limbs
and lechery: but the gout galls the one, and the pox 332 pinches 333 the
other; and so both the degrees 334 prevent my curses.— Boy!</p>
<p>PAGE Sir?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What money is in my purse?</p>
<p>PAGE Seven groats 335 and two-pence.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I can get no remedy against this consumption 336 of the
purse. Borrowing only lingers and lingers it out, but the disease is
incurable. Go bear this letter to my lord of Lancaster, this to the
prince, this to the Earl of Westmorland, and this to old Mistress Ursula
337 , whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I perceived the first
white hair on my chin. About it: you know where to find me.</p>
<p>Gives letters</p>
<p>[Exit Page ]</p>
<p>A pox of 338 this gout, or a gout of this pox 339 ! For the one or
th’other plays the rogue with my great toe. It is no matter if I do halt
340 . I have the wars for my colour 341 , and my pension shall seem the
more reasonable. A good wit will make use of anything: I will turn
diseases to commodity 342 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
