<h4 id="introduction-to-a-midsummer-nights-dream">Introduction to A
Midsummer Night’s Dream</h4>
<p>Shakespeare is the poet of double vision. The father of twins, he was
a mingler of comedy and tragedy, low life and high, prose and verse. He
was a countryman who worked in the city, a teller of English folktales
who was equally versed in the mythology of ancient Greece and Rome. His
mind and world were poised between Catholicism and Protestantism, old
feudal ways and new bourgeois ambitions, rational thinking and visceral
instinct. A Midsummer Night’s Dream is one of his truly essential works
because nowhere else is his double vision more apparent than in this
play’s movement between the city and the wood, day and night, reason and
imagination, waking life and dream.</p>
<p>Wood, night, imagination, dream. These are the co-ordinates of the
second form of sight, which is best described as magical thinking. It is
the mode of being that belongs to visionaries, astrologers, ‘wise women’
and poets. It conjures up a world animated with energies and spirit
forces; it finds correspondences between earthly things and divine. The
eye that sees in this way rolls in a fine frenzy, glancing from heaven
to earth, from earth to heaven. It bodies forth the forms of things
unknown, turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothings a local
habitation and a name.</p>
<p>Magical thinking answers a deep human need. It is a way of making
sense of things that would otherwise seem painfully arbitrary – things
like love and beauty. An ugly birthmark on a baby would be explained
away by the suggestion that the infant might be a ‘changeling child’,
swapped in the cradle by some night-tripping fairy. The sheer chance
involved in the process of what we now call sexual chemistry may be
rationalized in the story of the magic properties of the juice of the
flower called love-in-idleness. And in a world dependent on an
agricultural economy, bad harvests were somehow more palatable if
explained by the intervention of malicious sprites upon the operation of
the weather.</p>
<p>In the age of candle and rush-light, nights were seriously dark. The
night was accordingly imagined to be seriously different from the day.
The very fact of long hours of light itself conferred a kind of magic
upon midsummer night. This is the night of the year when magical
thinking is given full rein.</p>
<p>Theseus and Hippolyta never meet Oberon and Titania. In the original
performance, the respective roles were likely to have been doubled. The
contentious king and queen of fairies thus become the dark psychological
doubles of the betrothed courtly couple. The correspondence inevitably
calls into question the joy of the match between Athenian and Amazon.
Oberon actually accuses Titania of having led Theseus ‘through the
glimmering night’ when he deserted ‘Perigenia whom he ravishèd’, of
having made the day duke break faith with a succession of paramours.
Shakespeare loves to set up an antithesis, then knock it down. Here he
implies that there is ultimately no sharp distinction between day and
night: the sexual ethics of Theseus are perhaps as dubious as those of
the adulterous child-possessor Titania.</p>
<p>Authority figures, representatives of the day world of political
power, win little sympathy in A Midsummer Night’s Dream . For the
lovers, the forest may be a place of confused identity, but at least it
is an escape from the patriarchal match-making of Egeus. In the
audience, the characters with whom we engage most warmly are neither
monarchs nor lords, but the mischief-making Robin Goodfellow and the
ineffable weaver, Bottom. Each in his way is an embodiment of the
theatrical spirit that animates everything that is most gloriously
Shakespearean. Always a man of the theatre, Shakespeare lives in a world
of illusion and make-believe that hits at deepest truths; he knows that
his world is fundamentally sympathetic to those other counter-worlds
which we call dream and magic.</p>
<p>Robin the Puck compares the mortals to fools in a fond pageant: he
has a right to think of himself as author of the play, since it is his
dispensing of the love juice that fuels the plot. As for Bottom, at one
level he is a bad actor. In both rehearsal and performance of ‘Pyramus
and Thisbe’, it becomes clear that he does not really understand the
rules of the theatrical game. But at a deeper level, he is a true
dramatic genius: he is gifted with the child’s grace to suspend his
disbelief. As Pyramus, he puts up a pretty poor performance; as Ass, it
is another matter. The comical deficiency of ‘Pyramus and Thisbe’ is
that the actors keep telling us that they haven’t become their
characters. The Assification of Bottom is, by contrast, akin to those
brilliant assumptions of disguise – Rosalind becoming Ganymede in As You
Like It , Viola Cesario in Twelfth Night – through which Shakespeare
simultaneously reminds us that we are in the theatre (an actor is always
in disguise) and helps us to forget where we are (we willingly suspend
our disbelief). In that forgetting, we participate in the mystery of
magical thinking. With Bottom himself, we in the audience may say ‘I
have had a most rare vision.’</p>
<p>Many members of Shakespeare’s original audience, steeped as they were
in the New Testament, would have recognized Bottom’s account of his
dream as an allusion – with the attributes of the different senses
comically garbled – to a famous passage in the first Epistle to the
Corinthians, in which St Paul says that the eye of man has not seen and
the ear of man has not heard the glories that will await us when we
enter the Kingdom of Heaven. In the Geneva translation of the Bible,
which Shakespeare knew well, the passage speaks of how the human spirit
searches ‘the bottom of God’s secrets’. Jesus said that in order to
enter his kingdom, one had to make oneself as a child. The same may be
said of the kingdom of theatre. It is because Bottom has the uncynical,
believing spirit of a child that he is vouchsafed his vision. At the
same time, Shakespeare himself offers a dangerously grown up image of
what heaven might be like: the weaver may be innocent but the fairy
queen is an embodiment of sexual experience. The ‘virgin queen’
Elizabeth was also known as England’s ‘fairy queen’ and the wood in
which the action takes place, with its ‘nine men’s morris’ and English
wild flowers, is more domestic than Athenian, so there must have been an
inherent political risk in the representation of a sexually voracious
Titania. Shakespeare perhaps introduced Oberon’s apparent allusion to a
chaste Elizabeth – the ‘fair vestal thronèd by the west’ – in order to
dismiss any identification of Titania with the real-life fairy queen
whom he knew would at some point be a spectator of the play.</p>
<p>The comedy and the charm of the Dream depend on a certain fragility.
Good comedy is tragedy narrowly averted, while fairy charm is only safe
from sentimentality if attached to some potential for the grotesque.
Fairies only deserve to be believed in when they have the capacity to be
seriously unpleasant. Of course we laugh when Bottom wears the head of
an ass and makes love to a queen, but the image deliberately courts the
suggestion of bestiality. In Ovid’s Metamorphoses , Shakespeare’s
favourite book and the source for the tale of ‘Pyramus and Thisbe’,
people are driven by bestial desires and are rewarded by being
transformed into animals. In Shakespeare, the ass’s head is worn in
play, but it remains the closest thing in the drama of his age to an
actual animal metamorphosis on stage.</p>
<p>Ovid was rational Rome’s great counter-visionary, its magical
thinker. His theme is transformation, the inevitability of change. Book
fifteen of the Metamorphoses offers a philosophical discourse on the
subject, mediated via the philosophy of Pythagoras. From here
Shakespeare got many of those images of transience that roll through his
Sonnets, but in the Dream he celebrates the transfiguring and enduring
power of night vision, of second sight.</p>
<p>Night is the time for fantasy and for love, the time in which your
wildest hopes may be indulged but your worst nightmares may have to be
confronted. The action in the forest fills the space between the
betrothal and the wedding celebration of Theseus and Hippolyta. For the
young lovers it is also a time-between, the time, that is to say, of
maturation, of discovering who they really are and whom they really
love. When Hermia and Lysander, Helena and Demetrius emerge after a
midsummer night’s madness in the wood, they don’t quite know what’s
happened: ‘Methinks I see these things with parted eye, / When
everything seems double.’ And they’re not all quite sure if they’ve
finally gained the person they want: ‘And I have found Demetrius like a
jewel, / Mine own and not mine own.’ But on reflection in the cold light
of morning, the strangeness of the night has effected a material
transformation, leading the lovers to a truer place than the one where
they were at court the day before. Perhaps because she is herself a
‘stranger’, an outsider in the ‘civilized’ world of Athens, it is the
Amazon queen Hippolyta who understands this best:</p>
<p>But all the story of the night told over,</p>
<p>And all their minds transfigured so together,</p>
<p>More witnesseth than fancy’s images,</p>
<p>And grows to something of great constancy;</p>
<p>But howsoever, strange and admirable.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Egeus orders his daughter Hermia to marry Demetrius; she
refuses because she and Lysander are in love. Her friend Helena is in
love with Demetrius, who once loved her but now does not. Under the law
of Athens, Duke Theseus gives Hermia four days to obey her father on
pain of death or confinement to a nunnery. Hermia and Lysander escape
this harsh law by running away to the woods. Demetrius pursues them
there, with Helena pursing him. In the woods, Oberon and Titania, King
and Queen of fairies, have quarrelled because Titania refuses to hand
over an Indian changeling boy to be Oberon’s page. Oberon instructs the
mischievous Puck, Robin Goodfellow, to press the juice of a magic flower
on Titania’s eyes as she sleeps; it will make her fall in love with the
first being she sees on waking. In an attempt to reconcile Demetrius and
Helena, Oberon orders that juice should be put on his eyes whilst he is
sleeping and she is near, but Robin mistakenly puts it on Lysander, who
thus falls in love with Helena. She thinks she is being mocked.
Love-juice is then placed on Demetrius’ eyes in order to rectify the
mistake, but the result is that he too falls for Helena. The boys fight
over her and the girls quarrel. While Titania has been sleeping, a
company of Athenian artisans under the leadership of Peter Quince has
come to the wood to rehearse a play for the ensuing wedding festivities
of Duke Theseus and Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons. Robin puts an ass’s
head on Bottom the weaver and because of the love-juice Titania falls in
love with him. Eventually all is restored to right and the artisans
perform their comically tragic play of ‘Pyramus and Thisbe’.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Bottom (12%/59/5), Theseus (11%/48/3), Helena (11%/36/5), Robin
Goodfellow (10%/33/6), Oberon (10%/29/5), Lysander (8%/50/5), Hermia
(8%/48/5), Titania (7%/23/5), Demetrius (6%/48/5), Quince (5%/40/4),
Flute (3%/18/4), Egeus (3%/13/3), Hippolyta (2%/14/3).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 80% verse, 20% prose. Fairly high incidence of
rhyme, including deliberately bad rhyme in ‘Pyramus and Thisbe’.</p>
<p>DATE: Mentioned in Francis Meres’ 1598 list of Shakespeare’s plays.
Reference in Act 1 scene 2 to courtiers being afraid of a stage lion may
allude to an incident in Scotland in August 1594. Strong stylistic
resemblances to other ‘lyrical’ plays of Shakespeare’s high Elizabethan
period, such as Richard II and especially Romeo and Juliet : this group
of plays is traditionally dated to 1595–96. It has often been speculated
that the first performance was a private one at an aristocratic wedding
celebration, but there is absolutely no evidence for this: in the
Elizabethan period, masque-like entertainments rather than full-length
plays were commissioned for festive occasions such as weddings.</p>
<p>SOURCES: The main plot is apparently without a direct source, which
is unusual for Shakespeare. The tale of Pyramus and Thisbe is derived
principally from Ovid’s Metamorphoses , book four. It also has strong
structural resemblances to the Romeo and Juliet story, which Shakespeare
dramatized around the same time. The play as a whole absorbs much of
Shakespeare’s eclectic reading: numerous borrowings of Ovidian
mythology, some use of Sir Thomas North’s translation of Plutarch,
influence from John Lyly’s comedies (especially Endimion for dreaming
and Gallathea for the interplay of aristocrats and artisans), an element
of Chaucer (The Knight’s Tale for lovers at the court of Theseus,
perhaps The Tale of Sir Thopas for the dream of sleeping with an
‘elf-queen’), perhaps The Golden Ass of Apuleius (trans. William
Adlington, 1566) for Bottom’s transformation.</p>
<p>TEXT: Quarto 1600, ‘as it hath been sundry times publicly acted by
the Right Honourable the Lord Chamberlain his Servants’, apparently
typeset from Shakespeare’s manuscript or a close transcription of it.
Reprinted 1619 (Second Quarto). Folio text was set from a copy of the
Second Quarto (thus repeating many of its corrections and errors), but
with some consultation of an independent theatre-derived manuscript,
which provided additional stage directions, some corrections, and signs
of a few revisions, most notably an economizing on roles whereby the
Philostrate of Quarto becomes a silent character who only appears in the
first scene and the role of Master of the Revels introducing the
entertainment in the final scene is taken over by Egeus (which makes for
nice tension between him and Lysander, the new son-in-law he did not
want). Our edition retains this innovation as well as many local Folio
corrections and modernizations, but restores Quarto in many cases where
words are mis-set, omitted or transposed as a result of what was almost
certainly compositor’s error as opposed to editorial alterations on the
basis of the theatre manuscript.</p>
