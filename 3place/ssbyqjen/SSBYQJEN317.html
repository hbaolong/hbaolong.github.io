<p>Enter Pandarus and Troilus’ Man 1211</p>
<p>PANDARUS How now? Where’s thy master? At my cousin Cressida’s?</p>
<p>MAN No, sir, he stays 1212 for you to conduct 1213 him thither.</p>
<p>Enter Troilus</p>
<p>PANDARUS O, here he comes.—How now, how now?</p>
<p>TROILUS Sirrah 1214 , walk off.</p>
<p>[Exit Troilus’ Man ]</p>
<p>PANDARUS Have you seen my cousin 1215 ?</p>
<p>TROILUS No, Pandarus: I stalk 1216 about her door,</p>
<p>Like a strange 1217 soul upon the Stygian banks 1218</p>
<p>Staying for waftage 1219 . O, be thou my Charon 1220 ,</p>
<p>And give me swift transportance to those fields 1221</p>
<p>Where I may wallow in the lily-beds 1222</p>
<p>Proposed 1223 for the deserver. O gentle Pandarus,</p>
<p>From Cupid’s shoulder pluck his painted 1224 wings</p>
<p>And fly with me to Cressid!</p>
<p>PANDARUS Walk here i’th’orchard 1225 , I’ll bring her straight 1226
.</p>
<p>Exit Pandarus</p>
<p>TROILUS I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.</p>
<p>Th’imaginary relish 1227 is so sweet</p>
<p>That it enchants my sense 1228 : what will it be 1229 ,</p>
<p>When that the wat’ry 1230 palates taste indeed 1231</p>
<p>Love’s thrice-repurèd 1232 nectar 1233 ? Death 1234 , I fear me,</p>
<p>Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine 1235 ,</p>
<p>Too subtle-potent 1236 , tuned too sharp 1237 in sweetness,</p>
<p>For the capacity 1238 of my ruder 1239 powers 1240 ;</p>
<p>I fear it much, and I do fear besides,</p>
<p>That I shall lose distinction in my joys 1241 ,</p>
<p>As doth a battle 1242 , when they charge on heaps 1243</p>
<p>The enemy flying 1244 .</p>
<p>Enter Pandarus</p>
<p>PANDARUS She’s making her 1245 ready, she’ll come straight. You must
be witty 1246 now: she does so blush, and fetches her wind so short 1247
, as if she were fraid with 1248 a sprite 1249 . I’ll fetch her. It is
the prettiest 1250 villain 1251 : she fetches her breath so short as a
new-ta’en 1252 sparrow 1253 .</p>
<p>Exit Pandarus</p>
<p>TROILUS Even 1254 such a passion doth embrace my bosom:</p>
<p>My heart beats thicker 1255 than a feverous pulse,</p>
<p>And all my powers do their bestowing 1256 lose,</p>
<p>Like vassalage 1257 at unawares 1258 encount’ring</p>
<p>The eye of majesty.</p>
<p>Enter Pandarus and Cressida [veiled ]</p>
<p>PANDARUS Come, come, what need you blush? Shame’s a baby. Here she is
now: swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me.— What, are
you gone again? You must be watched 1259 ere you be made tame, must you?
Come your ways 1260 , come your ways, an you draw backward 1261 , we’ll
put you i’th’fills 1262 .— Why do you not speak to her? Come, draw this
curtain 1263 , and let’s see your picture 1264 . Alas the day, how loath
you are to offend daylight! An ’twere dark, you’d close 1265 sooner. So,
so, rub on, and kiss the mistress 1266 . How now, a kiss in fee-farm
1267 1268 ? Build there, carpenter, the air 1269 is sweet. Nay, you
shall fight your hearts out 1270 ere I part you. The falcon as the
tercel 1271 1272 , for all the ducks i’th’river 1273 . Go to, go to.</p>
<p>TROILUS You have bereft 1274 me of all words, lady.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Words pay no debts 1275 , give her deeds 1276 . But she’ll
bereave you o’th’deeds too, if she call your activity 1277 in question.
What, billing 1278 again? Here’s ‘In witness whereof the parties
interchangeably 1279 .’ Come in, come in: I’ll go get a fire 1280 .</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Will you walk in, my lord?</p>
<p>TROILUS O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Wished, my lord? The gods grant— O my lord!</p>
<p>TROILUS What should they grant? What makes this pretty 1281 abruption
1282 ? What too curious 1283 dreg 1284 espies my sweet lady in the
fountain of our love?</p>
<p>CRESSIDA More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.</p>
<p>TROILUS Fears make devils of cherubims: they never see truly.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Blind fear, that seeing reason leads 1285 , finds safer
footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to fear the worst oft
cures the worse.</p>
<p>TROILUS O, let my lady apprehend 1286 no fear: in all Cupid’s pageant
1287 there is presented no monster.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Nor nothing monstrous 1288 neither?</p>
<p>TROILUS Nothing, but our undertakings 1289 , when we vow to weep
seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking it harder for our
mistress to devise imposition 1290 enough than for us to undergo any
difficulty imposed. This is the monstruosity 1291 in love, lady, that
the will 1292 is infinite and the execution 1293 confined, that the
desire is</p>
<p>boundless and the act 1294 a slave to limit.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA They say all lovers swear more performance than they are
able, and yet reserve 1295 an ability that they never perform, vowing
more than the perfection of ten 1296 and discharging less than the tenth
part of one. They that have the voice of lions and the act of hares, are
they not monsters?</p>
<p>TROILUS Are there such 1297 ? Such are not we 1298 : praise us as we
are tasted 1299 , allow 1300 us as we prove 1301 , our head 1302 shall
go bare till merit crown it 1303 . No perfection in reversion 1304 shall
have a praise in present: we will not name desert 1305 before his birth,
and, being born, his addition 1306 shall be humble. Few words to fair
faith 1307 . Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst
shall be a mock for his truth 1308 , and what truth can speak truest not
truer than Troilus.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Will you walk in, my lord?</p>
<p>Enter Pandarus</p>
<p>PANDARUS What, blushing still? Have you not done talking yet?</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Well, uncle, what folly 1309 I commit, I dedicate to
you.</p>
<p>PANDARUS I thank you 1310 for that: if my lord get 1311 a boy of you,
you’ll give him me 1312 . Be true to my lord: if he flinch 1313 , chide
me for it.</p>
<p>TROILUS You know now your hostages: your uncle’s word and my firm
faith.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Nay, I’ll give my word for her too: our kindred, though they
be long ere they are wooed, they are constant being won. They are burrs
1314 , I can tell you: they’ll stick where they are thrown 1315 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Boldness 1316 comes to me now, and brings me heart.</p>
<p>Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day</p>
<p>For many weary months.</p>
<p>TROILUS Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,</p>
<p>With the first glance that ever — pardon me —</p>
<p>If I confess much, you will play the tyrant 1317 .</p>
<p>I love you now, but not, till now, so much</p>
<p>But I might master it 1318 ; in faith, I lie:</p>
<p>My thoughts were like unbridled 1319 children grown</p>
<p>Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!</p>
<p>Why have I blabbed? Who shall be true to us,</p>
<p>When we are so unsecret to ourselves?</p>
<p>But, though I loved you well, I wooed you not,</p>
<p>And yet, good faith, I wished myself a man,</p>
<p>Or that we women had men’s privilege 1320</p>
<p>Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,</p>
<p>For in this rapture I shall surely speak</p>
<p>The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,</p>
<p>Cunning 1321 in dumbness, from my weakness draws</p>
<p>My soul of counsel 1322 from me. Stop my mouth.</p>
<p>TROILUS And shall 1323 , albeit sweet music issues thence.</p>
<p>Kisses her</p>
<p>PANDARUS Pretty, i’faith.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA My lord, I do beseech you pardon me:</p>
<p>’Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss.</p>
<p>I am ashamed. O heavens, what have I done?</p>
<p>For this time 1324 will I take my leave, my lord.</p>
<p>TROILUS Your leave, sweet Cressid?</p>
<p>PANDARUS Leave? An you take leave till tomorrow morning—</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Pray you content you 1325 .</p>
<p>TROILUS What offends you, lady?</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Sir, mine own company.</p>
<p>TROILUS You cannot shun yourself.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Let me go and try:</p>
<p>I have a kind of self resides with you,</p>
<p>But an unkind 1326 self, that itself will leave</p>
<p>To be another’s fool 1327 . Where is my wit?</p>
<p>I would be gone: I speak I know not what.</p>
<p>TROILUS Well know they what they speak that speaks so wisely 1328
.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Perchance 1329 , my lord, I show more craft 1330 than
love,</p>
<p>And fell so roundly 1331 to a large 1332 confession</p>
<p>To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise 1333 ,</p>
<p>Or else you love not, for to be wise and love</p>
<p>Exceeds man’s might: that 1334 dwells with gods above.</p>
<p>TROILUS O, that I thought it could be in a woman —</p>
<p>As, if it can, I will presume 1335 in you —</p>
<p>To feed for aye 1336 her lamp and flames of love,</p>
<p>To keep her constancy in plight 1337 and youth,</p>
<p>Outliving beauty’s outward 1338 , with a mind</p>
<p>That doth renew swifter 1339 than blood decays 1340 !</p>
<p>Or that persuasion could but thus convince me</p>
<p>That my integrity and truth to you</p>
<p>Might be affronted 1341 with the match and weight</p>
<p>Of such a winnowed 1342 purity in love,</p>
<p>How were I 1343 then uplifted! But, alas,</p>
<p>I am as true as truth’s simplicity 1344</p>
<p>And simpler than the infancy of truth 1345 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA In that I’ll war with you.</p>
<p>TROILUS O virtuous fight,</p>
<p>When right with right wars who shall be most right!</p>
<p>True swains 1346 in love shall in the world to come</p>
<p>Approve 1347 their truths by Troilus 1348 : when their rhymes,</p>
<p>Full of protest 1349 , of oath and big compare 1350 ,</p>
<p>Want 1351 s similes, truth tired 1352 with iteration 1353 ,</p>
<p>As true as steel, as plantage 1354 to the moon,</p>
<p>As sun to day, as turtle 1355 to her mate,</p>
<p>As iron to adamant 1356 , as earth to th’centre 1357 ,</p>
<p>Yet, after all comparisons 1358 of truth,</p>
<p>As truth’s authentic 1359 author to be cited,</p>
<p>‘As true as Troilus’ shall crown up 1360 the verse,</p>
<p>And sanctify the numbers 1361 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Prophet may you be!</p>
<p>If I be false 1362 , or swerve a hair 1363 from truth,</p>
<p>When time is old and hath forgot itself,</p>
<p>When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,</p>
<p>And blind oblivion swallowed cities up,</p>
<p>And mighty states characterless 1364 are grated 1365</p>
<p>To dusty nothing, yet let memory,</p>
<p>From false to false, among false maids in love,</p>
<p>Upbraid my falsehood! When they’ve said ’As false</p>
<p>As air, as water, as wind, as sandy earth,</p>
<p>As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer’s calf,</p>
<p>Pard 1366 to the hind 1367 , or stepdame 1368 to her son’,</p>
<p>‘Yea’, let them say, to stick the heart 1369 of falsehood,</p>
<p>‘As false as Cressid.’</p>
<p>PANDARUS Go to, a bargain made: seal it 1370 , seal it, I’ll be the
witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin’s. If ever you prove
false one to another, since I have taken such pains to bring you
together, let all pitiful goers-between be called to the world’s end
after my name: call them all panders; let all constant men be Troiluses,
all false women Cressids, and all brokers-between panders! Say,
‘Amen.’</p>
<p>TROILUS Amen.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Amen.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a bed, which
bed, because 1371 it shall not speak of your pretty encounters 1372 ,
press it to death 1373 . Away! And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens
1374 here 1375 Bed, chamber and pander to provide this gear 1376 !</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
