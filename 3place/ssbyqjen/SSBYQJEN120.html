<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-7">Scene 2 ／ running scene 7</h4>
<p>Enter Prince [Don Pedro ], Claudio, Benedick and Leonato</p>
<p>DON PEDRO I do but stay till your marriage be consummate 571 , and
then go I toward Aragon.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO I’ll bring you thither, my lord, if you’ll vouchsafe 572
me.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your
marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I
will only be bold with 573 Benedick for his company, for from the crown
of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth. He hath twice or
thrice cut Cupid’s bow-string and the little hangman 574 dare not shoot
at him. He hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the
clapper, for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Gallants, I am not as I have been.</p>
<p>LEONATO So say I, methinks you are sadder.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO I hope he be in love.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Hang him, truant 575 ! There’s no true drop of blood in him
to be truly touched with love. If he be sad, he wants 576 money.</p>
<p>BENEDICK I have the toothache.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Draw 577 it.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Hang it 578 .</p>
<p>CLAUDIO You must hang it 579 first, and draw it afterwards.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO What? Sigh for the toothache?</p>
<p>LEONATO Where 580 is but a humour or a worm 581 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK Well, everyone cannot master a grief but 582 he that has
it.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Yet say I, he is in love.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO There is no appearance of fancy 583 in him, unless it be a
fancy that he hath to strange disguises — as to be a Dutchman today, a
Frenchman tomorrow 584 . Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it
appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it to appear
he is.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing
old signs: a brushes his hat o’mornings, what should that bode?</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Hath any man seen him at the barber’s?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO No, but the barber’s man hath been seen with him, and the old
ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis-balls 585 .</p>
<p>LEONATO Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a
beard.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Nay, a rubs himself with civet 586 . Can you smell him out
587 by that?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO That’s as much as to say the sweet youth’s in love.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO The greatest note 588 of it is his melancholy.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO And when was he wont 589 to wash 590 his face?</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Yea, or to paint 591 himself? For the which, I hear what
they say of him.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is now crept into a
lute-string 592 and now governed 593 by stops 594 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Indeed, that tells a heavy 595 tale for him. Conclude: he
is in love.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Nay, but I know who loves him.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO That would I know too. I warrant, one that knows him
not.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Yes, and his ill conditions 596 , and in despite of all, dies
597 for him.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO She shall be buried with her face upwards 598 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old signior 599 ,
walk aside with me: I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to
you, which these hobby- horses 600 must not hear.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Benedick and Leonato ]</p>
<p>DON PEDRO For 601 my life, to break with him about Beatrice.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO ’Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this 602 played their
parts with Beatrice, and then the two bears will not bite one another
when they meet.</p>
<p>Enter [Don ] John the Bastard</p>
<p>DON JOHN My lord and brother, God save you 603 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Good den 604 , brother.</p>
<p>DON JOHN If your leisure served 605 , I would speak with you.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO In private?</p>
<p>DON JOHN If it please you. Yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I
would speak of concerns him.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO What’s the matter?</p>
<p>DON JOHN Means your lordship to be married tomorrow?</p>
<p>To Claudio</p>
<p>DON PEDRO You know he does.</p>
<p>DON JOHN I know not that, when he knows what I know.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.</p>
<p>DON JOHN You may think I love you not: let that appear hereafter 606
, and aim better at me by that I now will manifest 607 . For my brother,
I think he holds 608 you well, and in dearness of heart, hath holp to
effect your ensuing marriage — surely suit ill spent and labour ill
bestowed.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Why, what’s the matter?</p>
<p>DON JOHN I came hither to tell you, and, circumstances shortened 609
— for she has been too long a talking of 610 — the lady is disloyal.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Who, Hero?</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Even she: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every man’s Hero.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Disloyal?</p>
<p>DON JOHN The word is too good to paint out 611 her wickedness. I
could say she were worse: think you of a worse title, and I will fit 612
her to it. Wonder 613 not till further warrant 614 . Go but with me
tonight, you shall see her chamber window entered, even the night before
her wedding-day. If you love her then, tomorrow wed her. But it would
better fit 615 your honour to change your mind.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO May this be so?</p>
<p>DON PEDRO I will not think it.</p>
<p>DON JOHN If you dare not trust that you see, confess not that you
know 616 617 . If you will follow me, I will show you enough, and when
you have seen more and heard more, proceed accordingly.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her tomorrow
in the congregation where I should wed, there will I shame her.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join with
thee to disgrace her.</p>
<p>DON JOHN I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses.
Bear it coldly but till night, and let the issue show itself.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO O day untowardly turned 618 !</p>
<p>CLAUDIO O mischief 619 strangely thwarting!</p>
<p>DON JOHN O plague right well prevented! So will you say when you have
seen the sequel.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
