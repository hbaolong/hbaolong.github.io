20</h4>
<p>Enter King Richard in arms, with Norfolk, Ratcliffe and the Earl of
Surrey [with Soldiers, who pitch Richard’s tent ]</p>
<p>RICHARD Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth Field.</p>
<p>My lord of Surrey, why look you so sad 1701 ?</p>
<p>SURREY My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.</p>
<p>RICHARD My lord of Norfolk—</p>
<p>NORFOLK Here, most gracious liege.</p>
<p>RICHARD Norfolk, we must have knocks 1702 , ha? Must we not?</p>
<p>NORFOLK We must both give and take, my loving lord.</p>
<p>RICHARD Up with my tent! Here will I lie tonight,</p>
<p>But where tomorrow? Well, all’s one for that 1703 .</p>
<p>Who hath descried 1704 the number of the traitors?</p>
<p>NORFOLK Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.</p>
<p>RICHARD Why, our battalia 1705 trebles that account 1706 :</p>
<p>Besides, the king’s name is a tower of strength,</p>
<p>Which they upon the adverse faction want 1707 .</p>
<p>Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen,</p>
<p>Let us survey the vantage of the ground 1708 .</p>
<p>Call for some men of sound direction 1709 :</p>
<p>Let’s lack no discipline, make no delay,</p>
<p>For, lords, tomorrow is a busy day.</p>
<p>Exeunt [into the tent ]</p>
<p>Enter Richmond, Sir William Brandon, Oxford, [Blunt ] and Dorset
[with Soldiers, who pitch Richmond’s tent ]</p>
<p>RICHMOND The weary sun hath made a golden set,</p>
<p>And by the bright tract 1710 of his fiery car 1711 ,</p>
<p>Gives token of a goodly day tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard 1712 .</p>
<p>Give me some ink and paper in my tent:</p>
<p>I’ll draw the form and model 1713 of our battle,</p>
<p>Limit 1714 each leader to his several 1715 charge 1716 ,</p>
<p>And part in just proportion 1717 our small power.</p>
<p>My lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,</p>
<p>And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.</p>
<p>The Earl of Pembroke keeps 1718 his regiment;</p>
<p>Good Captain Blunt, bear my goodnight to him,</p>
<p>And by the second hour in the morning</p>
<p>Desire the earl to see me in my tent.</p>
<p>Yet one thing more, good captain, do for me:</p>
<p>Where is Lord Stanley quartered 1719 , do you know?</p>
<p>BLUNT Unless I have mista’en his colours 1720 much —</p>
<p>Which well I am assured I have not done —</p>
<p>His regiment lies half a mile at least</p>
<p>South from the mighty power of the king.</p>
<p>RICHMOND If without peril it be possible,</p>
<p>Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him,</p>
<p>And give him from me this most needful 1721 note.</p>
<p>BLUNT Upon my life, my lord, I’ll undertake it.</p>
<p>And so, God give you quiet rest tonight.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>RICHMOND Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,</p>
<p>Let us consult upon tomorrow’s business;</p>
<p>Into my tent: the dew is raw and cold.</p>
<p>They withdraw into the tent</p>
<p>Enter Richard, Ratcliffe, Norfolk and Catesby [and other Soldiers
]</p>
<p>RICHARD What is’t o’clock?</p>
<p>CATESBY It’s supper-time, my lord: it’s nine o’clock.</p>
<p>RICHARD I will not sup tonight.</p>
<p>Give me some ink and paper.</p>
<p>What, is my beaver 1722 easier 1723 than it was?</p>
<p>And all my armour laid into 1724 my tent?</p>
<p>CATESBY It is, my liege, and all things are in readiness.</p>
<p>RICHARD Good Norfolk, hie 1725 thee to thy charge 1726 :</p>
<p>Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.</p>
<p>NORFOLK I go, my lord.</p>
<p>RICHARD Stir with the lark tomorrow, gentle Norfolk.</p>
<p>NORFOLK I warrant 1727 you, my lord.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>RICHARD Ratcliffe!</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE My lord?</p>
<p>RICHARD Send out a pursuivant at arms 1728</p>
<p>To Stanley’s regiment: bid him bring his power</p>
<p>Before sun-rising, lest his son George fall</p>
<p>Into the blind cave of eternal night.—</p>
<p>Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch 1729 .</p>
<p>To other Soldiers</p>
<p>Saddle white Surrey 1730 for the field tomorrow.</p>
<p>Look that my staves 1731 be sound 1732 , and not too heavy.</p>
<p>Exit some Soldiers</p>
<p>Ratcliffe!</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE My lord?</p>
<p>RICHARD Saw’st the melancholy Lord Northumberland?</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,</p>
<p>Much about cockshut time 1733 , from troop to troop</p>
<p>Went through the army, cheering up 1734 the soldiers.</p>
<p>Enter a Soldier</p>
<p>RICHARD So, I am satisfied.— Give me a bowl of wine:—</p>
<p>I have not that alacrity 1735 of spirit,</p>
<p>Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont 1736 to have.—</p>
<p>Set it 1737 down.— Is ink and paper ready?</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE It is, my lord.</p>
<p>RICHARD Bid my guard watch. Leave me.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe, about the mid of night come to my tent</p>
<p>And help to arm me 1738 . Leave me, I say.</p>
<p>Exeunt Ratcliffe [and Soldiers ]</p>
<p>Richard withdraws to his tent, writes, and then sleeps</p>
<p>Enter Derby to Richmond in his tent</p>
<p>DERBY Fortune and victory sit on thy helm 1739 !</p>
<p>RICHMOND All comfort that the dark night can afford</p>
<p>Be to thy person, noble father-in-law 1740 !</p>
<p>Tell me, how fares our noble mother?</p>
<p>DERBY I, by attorney 1741 , bless thee from thy mother</p>
<p>Who prays continually for Richmond’s good.</p>
<p>So much for that. The silent hours steal on,</p>
<p>And flaky 1742 darkness breaks within the east.</p>
<p>In brief — for so the season 1743 bids us be —</p>
<p>Prepare thy battle early in the morning,</p>
<p>And put thy fortune to th’arbitrement 1744</p>
<p>Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring 1745 war.</p>
<p>I, as I may — that which I would 1746 I cannot —</p>
<p>With best advantage will deceive the time 1747 ,</p>
<p>And aid thee in this doubtful shock 1748 of arms.</p>
<p>But on thy side I may not be too forward 1749</p>
<p>Lest, being seen, thy brother 1750 , tender 1751 George,</p>
<p>Be executed in his father’s sight.</p>
<p>Farewell. The leisure 1752 and the fearful time</p>
<p>Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love</p>
<p>And ample interchange 1753 of sweet discourse 1754</p>
<p>Which so long sundered 1755 friends should dwell upon:</p>
<p>God give us leisure for these rites of love!</p>
<p>Once more, adieu. Be valiant, and speed well!</p>
<p>RICHMOND Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:</p>
<p>I’ll strive with 1756 troubled noise to take a nap,</p>
<p>Lest leaden slumber peise 1757 me down tomorrow,</p>
<p>When I should mount with wings of victory.</p>
<p>Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Exeunt. Richmond remains</p>
<p>O thou, whose captain I account 1758 myself,</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>Look on my forces with a gracious 1759 eye:</p>
<p>Put in their hands thy bruising irons 1760 of wrath,</p>
<p>That they may crush down with a heavy fall</p>
<p>Th’usurping helmets of our adversaries!</p>
<p>Make us thy ministers of chastisement,</p>
<p>That we may praise thee in thy victory!</p>
<p>To thee I do commend my watchful 1761 soul,</p>
<p>Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:</p>
<p>Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!</p>
<p>Sleeps</p>
<p>Enter the Ghost of Prince Edward 1762 , son to Henry VI</p>
<p>GHOST OF PRINCE EDWARD Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow!</p>
<p>To Richard</p>
<p>Think how thou stab’st me in my prime of youth</p>
<p>At Tewkesbury: despair 1763 therefore, and die!—</p>
<p>Be cheerful, Richmond, for the wrongèd souls</p>
<p>To Richmond</p>
<p>Of butchered princes fight in thy behalf.</p>
<p>King Henry’s issue 1764 , Richmond, comforts thee.</p>
<p>[Exit? ]</p>
<p>The Ghosts either exit individually or remain onstage</p>
<p>Enter the Ghost of Henry the Sixth</p>
<p>GHOST OF KING HENRY VI When I was mortal, my anointed 1765 body</p>
<p>To Richard</p>
<p>By thee was punchèd 1766 full of holes;</p>
<p>Think on the Tower 1767 and me: despair and die!</p>
<p>Harry the Sixth bids thee despair and die!—</p>
<p>Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror!</p>
<p>To Richmond</p>
<p>Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be king,</p>
<p>Doth comfort thee in sleep: live and flourish!</p>
<p>[Exit? ]</p>
<p>Enter the Ghost of Clarence</p>
<p>GHOST OF CLARENCE Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow!</p>
<p>To Richard</p>
<p>I, that was washed 1768 to death with fulsome 1769 wine,</p>
<p>Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death!</p>
<p>Tomorrow in the battle think on me,</p>
<p>And fall 1770 thy edgeless 1771 sword: despair and die!—</p>
<p>Thou offspring of the House of Lancaster,</p>
<p>To Richmond</p>
<p>The wrongèd heirs of York do pray for thee.</p>
<p>Good angels guard thy battle 1772 ! Live and flourish!</p>
<p>[Exit? ]</p>
<p>Enter the Ghosts of Rivers, Grey and Vaughan</p>
<p>GHOST OF RIVERS Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow,</p>
<p>To Richard</p>
<p>Rivers that died at Pomfret: despair and die!</p>
<p>GHOST OF GREY Think upon Grey, and let thy soul despair!</p>
<p>To Richard</p>
<p>GHOST OF VAUGHAN Think upon Vaughan, and, with guilty fear,</p>
<p>To Richard</p>
<p>Let fall thy lance: despair and die!</p>
<p>ALL Awake, and think our wrongs in Richard’s bosom</p>
<p>To Richmond</p>
<p>Will conquer him! Awake, and win the day!</p>
<p>[Exeunt Ghosts? ]</p>
<p>Enter the Ghost of Lord Hastings</p>
<p>GHOST OF HASTINGS Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake</p>
<p>To Richard</p>
<p>And in a bloody battle end thy days!</p>
<p>Think on Lord Hastings: despair and die!</p>
<p>Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!</p>
<p>To Richmond</p>
<p>Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England’s sake!</p>
<p>[Exit? ]</p>
<p>Enter the Ghosts of the two young Princes</p>
<p>GHOSTS OF PRINCES Dream on thy cousins smothered in the Tower:</p>
<p>To Richard</p>
<p>Let us be laid 1773 within thy bosom, Richard,</p>
<p>And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!</p>
<p>Thy nephews’ souls bid thee despair and die!—</p>
<p>Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace and wake in joy:</p>
<p>To Richmond</p>
<p>Good angels guard thee from the boar’s annoy 1774 !</p>
<p>Live and beget a happy race of kings!</p>
<p>Edward’s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.</p>
<p>[Exit Ghosts? ]</p>
<p>Enter the Ghost of Anne, his wife</p>
<p>GHOST OF ANNE Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,</p>
<p>To Richard</p>
<p>That never slept a quiet 1775 hour with thee,</p>
<p>Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.</p>
<p>Tomorrow in the battle think on me,</p>
<p>And fall thy edgeless sword: despair and die!—</p>
<p>Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep:</p>
<p>To Richmond</p>
<p>Dream of success and happy victory!</p>
<p>Thy adversary’s wife doth pray for thee.</p>
<p>[Exit? ]</p>
<p>Enter the Ghost of Buckingham</p>
<p>GHOST OF BUCKINGHAM The first was I that helped thee to the
crown:</p>
<p>To Richard</p>
<p>The last was I that felt thy tyranny.</p>
<p>O, in the battle think on Buckingham,</p>
<p>And die in terror of thy guiltiness!</p>
<p>Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death:</p>
<p>Fainting 1776 , despair; despairing, yield 1777 thy breath!—</p>
<p>I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid;</p>
<p>To Richmond</p>
<p>But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismayed:</p>
<p>God and good angels fight on Richmond’s side,</p>
<p>And Richard 1778 fall in height of all his pride.</p>
<p>[Exit? ]</p>
<p>If the Ghosts have not exited individually, they all vanish at this
point</p>
<p>Richard starts out of his dream</p>
<p>RICHARD Give me another horse! Bind up my wounds!</p>
<p>Have mercy, Jesu! — Soft 1779 , I did but dream.</p>
<p>O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!</p>
<p>The lights burn blue 1780 . It is not dead midnight.</p>
<p>Cold fearful drops 1781 stand on my trembling flesh.</p>
<p>What? Do I fear myself? There’s none else by.</p>
<p>Richard loves Richard: that is, I am I.</p>
<p>Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am.</p>
<p>Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why:</p>
<p>Lest I revenge. What? Myself upon myself?</p>
<p>Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? 1782 For any good</p>
<p>That I myself have done unto myself?</p>
<p>O no! Alas, I rather hate myself</p>
<p>For hateful deeds committed by myself!</p>
<p>I am a villain: yet I lie, I am not.</p>
<p>Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.</p>
<p>My conscience hath a thousand several 1783 tongues,</p>
<p>And every tongue brings in 1784 a several tale,</p>
<p>And every tale condemns me for a villain.</p>
<p>Perjury in the high’st degree,</p>
<p>Murder, stern murder, in the direst degree,</p>
<p>All several sins, all used in each degree 1785 ,</p>
<p>Throng all to th’bar 1786 , crying all, ‘Guilty! Guilty!’</p>
<p>I shall despair. There is no creature 1787 loves me;</p>
<p>And if I die, no soul shall pity me.</p>
<p>Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself</p>
<p>Find in myself no pity to myself?</p>
<p>Methought the souls of all that I had murdered</p>
<p>Came to my tent, and every one did threat 1788</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s vengeance on the head of Richard.</p>
<p>Enter Ratcliffe</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE My lord?</p>
<p>RICHARD Who’s there?</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Ratcliffe, my lord, ’tis I. The early village cock</p>
<p>Hath twice done salutation to the morn.</p>
<p>Your friends are up and buckle on their armour.</p>
<p>RICHARD O Ratcliffe, I fear, I fear—</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows 1789 .</p>
<p>RICHARD By the apostle Paul, shadows tonight</p>
<p>Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard</p>
<p>Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers</p>
<p>Armèd in proof 1790 , and led by shallow Richmond.</p>
<p>’Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me:</p>
<p>Under our tents I’ll play the eavesdropper,</p>
<p>To hear if any mean to shrink from 1791 me.</p>
<p>Exeunt Richard and Ratcliffe</p>
<p>Enter the Lords to Richmond, sitting in his tent</p>
<p>LORDS Good morrow, Richmond!</p>
<p>RICHMOND Cry mercy 1792 , lords and watchful 1793 gentlemen,</p>
<p>That you have ta’en 1794 a tardy sluggard here.</p>
<p>LORDS How have you slept, my lord?</p>
<p>RICHMOND The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams</p>
<p>That ever entered in a drowsy head,</p>
<p>Have I since your departure had, my lords.</p>
<p>Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murdered,</p>
<p>Came to my tent and cried on 1795 victory:</p>
<p>I promise you my heart is very jocund 1796</p>
<p>In the remembrance of so fair a dream.</p>
<p>How far into the morning is it, lords?</p>
<p>LORDS Upon the stroke of four.</p>
<p>RICHMOND Why, then ’tis time to arm and give direction.—</p>
<p>More than I have said 1797 , loving countrymen,</p>
<p>His oration to his Soldiers</p>
<p>The leisure 1798 and enforcement 1799 of the time</p>
<p>Forbids to dwell upon. Yet remember this:</p>
<p>God and our good cause fight upon our side,</p>
<p>The prayers of holy saints and wrongèd souls,</p>
<p>Like high-reared bulwarks 1800 , stand before our faces,</p>
<p>Richard except 1801 , those whom we fight against</p>
<p>Had rather have us win than him they follow:</p>
<p>For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,</p>
<p>A bloody tyrant and a homicide:</p>
<p>One raised 1802 in blood, and one in blood established 1803 ;</p>
<p>One that made means 1804 to come by what he hath,</p>
<p>And slaughtered those that were the means to help him:</p>
<p>A base foul stone 1805 , made precious by the foil 1806</p>
<p>Of England’s chair 1807 , where he is falsely 1808 set:</p>
<p>One that hath ever been God’s enemy.</p>
<p>Then if you fight against God’s enemy,</p>
<p>God will in justice ward 1809 you as his soldiers:</p>
<p>If you do swear to put a tyrant down,</p>
<p>You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain:</p>
<p>If you do fight against your country’s foes,</p>
<p>Your country’s fat 1810 shall pay your pains the hire 1811 :</p>
<p>If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,</p>
<p>Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors:</p>
<p>If you do free your children from the sword,</p>
<p>Your children’s children quits 1812 it in your age 1813 .</p>
<p>Then, in the name of God and all these rights,</p>
<p>Advance your standards 1814 , draw your willing swords.</p>
<p>For me, the ransom of my bold attempt</p>
<p>Shall be this cold corpse on the earth’s cold face 1815 :</p>
<p>But if I thrive 1816 , the gain of my attempt</p>
<p>The least of you shall share his part thereof.</p>
<p>Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully.</p>
<p>God and Saint George 1817 , Richmond and victory!</p>

<p>Enter King Richard, Ratcliffe and Catesby [with Attendants and
Soldiers ]</p>
<p>RICHARD What said Northumberland as touching 1818 Richmond?</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE That he was never trainèd up in arms.</p>
<p>RICHARD He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE He smiled and said, ‘The better for our purpose.’</p>
<p>RICHARD He was in the right, and so indeed it is.</p>
<p>Clock strikes</p>
<p>Tell 1819 the clock there. Give me a calendar 1820 .</p>
<p>Who saw the sun today?</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Not I, my lord.</p>
<p>RICHARD Then he disdains to shine, for by the book 1821</p>
<p>He should have braved 1822 the east 1823 an hour ago</p>
<p>A black 1824 day will it be to somebody. Ratcliffe!</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE My lord?</p>
<p>RICHARD The sun will not be seen today:</p>
<p>The sky doth frown and lour 1825 upon our army.</p>
<p>I would these dewy tears were from 1826 the ground.</p>
<p>Not shine today? Why, what is that to me</p>
<p>More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven</p>
<p>That frowns on me looks sadly 1827 upon him.</p>
<p>Enter Norfolk</p>
<p>NORFOLK Arm, arm, my lord: the foe vaunts 1828 in the field.</p>
<p>RICHARD Come, bustle, bustle. Caparison 1829 my horse.</p>
<p>He arms</p>
<p>Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power.</p>
<p>I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,</p>
<p>And thus my battle shall be orderèd:</p>
<p>My foreward 1830 shall be drawn 1831 in length,</p>
<p>Consisting equally of horse and foot 1832 :</p>
<p>Our archers shall be placèd in the midst;</p>
<p>John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,</p>
<p>Shall have the leading of the foot and horse.</p>
<p>They thus directed 1833 , we will follow</p>
<p>In the main battle, whose puissance 1834 on either side</p>
<p>Shall be well wingèd 1835 with our chiefest horse 1836 .</p>
<p>This, and Saint George to boot 1837 ! What think’st thou,
Norfolk?</p>
<p>NORFOLK A good direction, warlike sovereign.</p>
<p>This found I on my tent this morning:</p>
<p>Shows a paper</p>
<p>’Jockey 1838 of Norfolk, be not so bold,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>For Dickon 1839 thy master is bought and sold 1840 .’</p>
<p>RICHARD A thing devisèd by the enemy.</p>
<p>Go, gentleman, every man to his charge</p>
<p>Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:</p>
<p>For conscience is a word that cowards use,</p>
<p>Devised at first to keep the strong in awe.</p>
<p>Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.</p>
<p>March on, join 1841 bravely, let us to’t pell-mell 1842 :</p>
<p>If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.—</p>
<p>What shall I say more than I have inferred 1843 ?</p>
<p>His oration to his army</p>
<p>Remember whom you are to cope 1844 withal:</p>
<p>A sort 1845 of vagabonds, rascals and runaways,</p>
<p>A scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants,</p>
<p>Whom their o’er-cloyèd 1846 country vomits forth</p>
<p>To desperate adventures and assured destruction.</p>
<p>You sleeping safe, they bring you to unrest:</p>
<p>You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,</p>
<p>They would restrain 1847 the one, distain 1848 the other.</p>
<p>And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow 1849 ,</p>
<p>Long kept in Bretagne 1850 at our mother’s 1851 cost?</p>
<p>A milksop 1852 , one that never in his life</p>
<p>Felt so much cold as over-shoes in snow 1853 ?</p>
<p>Let’s whip these stragglers 1854 o’er the seas again,</p>
<p>Lash hence 1855 these overweening 1856 rags 1857 of France,</p>
<p>These famished beggars, weary of their lives,</p>
<p>Who, but 1858 for dreaming on this fond exploit 1859 ,</p>
<p>For want 1860 of means, poor rats, had hanged themselves.</p>
<p>If we be conquered, let men conquer us,</p>
<p>And not these bastard Bretons, whom our fathers</p>
<p>Have in their own land 1861 beaten, bobbed and thumped 1862 ,</p>
<p>And on record 1863 , left them the heirs of shame 1864 .</p>
<p>Shall these enjoy our lands? Lie 1865 with our wives?</p>
<p>Ravish 1866 our daughters?</p>
<p>Drum afar off</p>
<p>Hark! I hear their drum.</p>
<p>Fight, gentlemen of England! Fight boldly, yeomen 1867 !</p>
<p>Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!</p>
<p>Spur your proud 1868 horses hard, and ride in blood 1869 :</p>
<p>Amaze 1870 the welkin 1871 with your broken 1872 staves!</p>

<p>MESSENGER My lord, he doth deny 1873 to come.</p>
<p>RICHARD Off with his son George’s head!</p>

<p>After the battle let George Stanley die.</p>
<p>RICHARD A thousand hearts are great 1875 within my bosom.</p>
<p>Advance our standards, set upon our foes.</p>
<p>Our ancient word of courage 1876 , fair Saint George,</p>
<p>Inspire us with the spleen 1877 of fiery dragons 1878 !</p>

<p>RICHARD Slave, I have set my life upon a cast 1882 ,</p>
<p>And I will stand 1883 the hazard 1884 of the die 1885 .</p>
<p>I think there be six Richmonds 1886 in the field:</p>
<p>Five have I slain today instead of him.</p>

Retreat and flourish. Enter Richmond, Derby bearing the crown, with
divers other Lords</p>
<p>RICHMOND God and your arms be praised, victorious friends!</p>
<p>The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.</p>
<p>DERBY Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee 1887 .</p>
<p>Lo, here, these long-usurpèd royalties 1888</p>
<p>From the dead temples of this bloody wretch</p>
<p>Have I plucked off, to grace thy brows withal:</p>
<p>Wear it and make much of it.</p>
<p>RICHMOND Great God of heaven, say ‘Amen’ to all!</p>
<p>But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?</p>
<p>DERBY He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town,</p>
<p>Whither, if you please, we may withdraw us.</p>
<p>RICHMOND What men of name 1889 are slain on either side?</p>
<p>DERBY John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferris,</p>
<p>Sir Robert Brackenbury, and Sir William Brandon.</p>
<p>RICHMOND Inter their bodies as become their births 1890 :</p>
<p>Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled</p>
<p>That in submission will return to us:</p>
<p>And then, as we have ta’en the sacrament 1891 ,</p>
<p>We will unite the white rose and the red 1892 .</p>
<p>Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction 1893 ,</p>
<p>That long have frowned upon their enmity!</p>
<p>What traitor hears me and says not ‘Amen’?</p>
<p>England hath long been mad, and scarred herself;</p>
<p>The brother blindly shed the brother’s blood,</p>
<p>The father rashly slaughtered his own son,</p>
<p>The son, compelled, been butcher to the sire 1894 :</p>
<p>All this divided York and Lancaster,</p>
<p>Divided in their dire division.</p>
<p>O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth,</p>
<p>The true succeeders 1895 of each royal house,</p>
<p>By God’s fair ordinance 1896 conjoin together.</p>
<p>And let thy heirs — God, if thy will be so —</p>
<p>Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,</p>
<p>With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!</p>
<p>Abate 1897 the edge 1898 of traitors, gracious Lord,</p>
<p>That would reduce 1899 these bloody days again,</p>
<p>And make poor England weep in streams of blood;</p>
<p>Let them not live to taste this land’s increase 1900</p>
<p>That would with treason wound this fair land’s peace.</p>
<p>Now civil wounds are stopped 1901 , peace lives again:</p>
<p>That she may long live here, God say ‘Amen’!</p>

<p>BUCKINGHAM My lord, your promise for the earldom,—</p>
<p>RICHARD Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,</p>
<p>The mayor in courtesy showed me the castle,</p>
<p>And called it Rougemont: at which name I started,</p>
<p>Because a bard of Ireland told me once</p>
<p>I should not live long after I saw Richmond.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM My lord!</p>
<p>RICHARD Ay, what’s o’clock?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM I am thus bold to put your grace in mind</p>
<p>Of what you promised me.</p>
<p>RICHARD Well, but what’s o’clock?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Upon the stroke of ten.</p>
<p>RICHARD Well, let it strike.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Why let it strike?</p>
<p>RICHARD Because that, like a Jack, thou keep’st the stroke</p>
<p>Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.</p>
<p>I am not in the giving vein today.</p>

<p>RICHARD O Ratcliffe, I have dreamed a fearful dream!</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster , and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading ‘bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
