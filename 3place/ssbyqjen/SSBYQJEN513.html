16</h4>
<p>Enter two Clowns 1621</p>
<p>With a spade and a pickaxe</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN Is she to be buried in Christian burial 1622 that
wilfully seeks her own salvation 1623 ?</p>
<p>SECOND CLOWN I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
straight 1624 : the crowner 1625 hath sat 1626 on her, and finds it
Christian burial.</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own
defence?</p>
<p>SECOND CLOWN Why, ’tis found so.</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN It must be se offendendo 1627 , it cannot be else. For
here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act, and
an act hath three branches: it is to act, to do and to perform: argal
1628 , she drowned herself wittingly.</p>
<p>SECOND CLOWN Nay, but hear you, goodman 1629 delver—</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN Give me leave: here lies the water; good: here stands the
man; good: if the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will
he 1630 , nill he, he goes — mark you that. But if the water come to him
and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of
his own death shortens not his own life.</p>
<p>SECOND CLOWN But is this law?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN Ay, marry, is’t: crowner’s quest 1631 law.</p>
<p>SECOND CLOWN Will you ha’ the truth on’t? If this had not been a
gentlewoman, she should have been buried out of Christian burial.</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN Why, there thou say’st 1632 : and the more pity that
great folk should have countenance 1633 in this world to drown or hang
themselves, more than their even Christian 1634 . Come, my spade. There
is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers 1635 and grave-makers:
they hold up Adam’s profession 1636 .</p>
<p>SECOND CLOWN Was he a gentleman?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN He was the first that ever bore arms 1637 .</p>
<p>SECOND CLOWN Why, he had none.</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture? The Scripture says ‘Adam digged’. Could he dig without arms?
I’ll put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
purpose, confess thyself 1638 —</p>
<p>SECOND CLOWN Go to.</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN What is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the shipwright, or the carpenter?</p>
<p>SECOND CLOWN The gallows-maker, for that frame outlives a thousand
tenants.</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well
1639 ; but how does it well? It does well to those that do ill: now thou
dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
the gallows may do well to thee. To’t again, come.</p>
<p>SECOND CLOWN Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
carpenter?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN Ay, tell me that, and unyoke 1640 .</p>
<p>SECOND CLOWN Marry, now I can tell.</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN To’t.</p>
<p>SECOND CLOWN Mass, I cannot tell.</p>
<p>Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off</p>
<p>Hamlet cloaked?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will not mend 1641 his pace with beating; and when you are asked this
question next, say ‘A grave­maker: the houses that he makes lasts till
doomsday.’ Go, get thee to Yaughan 1642 : fetch me a stoup 1643 of
liquor.</p>
<p>[Exit Second Clown]</p>
<p>In youth, when I did love 1644 , did love,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Methought it was very sweet,</p>
<p>To contract-O-the time, for-a-my behove 1645 ,</p>
<p>O, methought there was nothing meet 1646 .</p>
<p>HAMLET Has this fellow no feeling of his business that he sings at
grave-making?</p>
<p>HORATIO Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness 1647 .</p>
<p>HAMLET ’Tis e’en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier
sense 1648 .</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN But age with his stealing steps</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Hath caught me in his clutch,</p>
<p>And hath shipped me intil 1649 the land 1650 ,</p>
<p>As if I had never been such 1651 .</p>
<p>Throws up a skull</p>
<p>HAMLET That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once: how the
knave jowls 1652 it to th’ground, as if it were Cain 1653 ’s jaw-bone,
that did the first murder. It might be the pate of a politician 1654 ,
which this ass o’er-offices 1655 , one that could circumvent 1656 God,
might it not?</p>
<p>HORATIO It might, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Or of a courtier, which could say ‘Good morrow, sweet lord!
How dost thou, good lord?’ This might be my lord Such-a-one, that
praised my lord Such-a- one’s horse when he meant to beg it, might it
not?</p>
<p>HORATIO Ay, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Why, e’en so, and now my lady Worm’s, chapless 1657 , and
knocked about the mazzard 1658 with a sexton’s spade: here’s fine
revolution 1659 , if we had the trick 1660 to see’t. Did these bones
cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats 1661 with ’em? 1662
Mine ache to think on’t.</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>For and 1663 a shrouding sheet 1664 :</p>
<p>O, a pit of clay for to be made</p>
<p>For such a guest is meet.</p>
<p>Throws up another skull</p>
<p>HAMLET There’s another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
Where be his quiddities now, his quillets 1665 , his cases, his tenures
1666 , and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude 1667 knave now to
knock him about the sconce 1668 with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him of his action of battery 1669 ? Hum. This fellow might be in’s time
a great buyer of land, with his statutes 1670 , his recognizances 1671 ,
his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries 1672 : is this the fine
of his fines 1673 and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch 1674 him no more of his
purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of
indentures 1675 1676 ? The very conveyances 1677 of his lands will
hardly lie in this box 1678 ; and must the inheritor 1679 himself have
no more, ha?</p>
<p>HORATIO Not a jot more, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Is not parchment made of sheepskins?</p>
<p>HORATIO Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.</p>
<p>HAMLET They are sheep and calves that seek out assurance in that 1680
. I will speak to this fellow.— Whose grave’s this, sirrah 1681 ?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN Mine, sir.</p>
<p>O, a pit of clay for to be made</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>For such a guest is meet.</p>
<p>HAMLET I think it be thine, indeed, for thou liest in’t.</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN You lie out on’t, sir, and therefore it is not yours. For
my part, I do not lie 1682 in’t, and yet it is mine.</p>
<p>HAMLET Thou dost lie in’t, to be in’t and say ’tis thine: ’tis for
the dead, not for the quick 1683 : therefore thou liest.</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN ’Tis a quick lie, sir: ’twill away again, from me to
you.</p>
<p>HAMLET What man dost thou dig it for?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN For no man, sir.</p>
<p>HAMLET What woman, then?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN For none, neither.</p>
<p>HAMLET Who is to be buried in’t?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she’s
dead.</p>
<p>HAMLET How absolute 1684 the knave is! We must speak by the card 1685
, or equivocation 1686 will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three
years I have taken note of it: the age is grown so picked 1687 that the
toe of the peasant comes so near the heels of our courtier, he galls his
kibe 1688 .— How long hast thou been a grave-maker?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN Of all the days i’th’year, I came to’t that day that our
last king Hamlet o’ercame Fortinbras.</p>
<p>HAMLET How long is that since?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that: it was
the very day that young Hamlet was born — he that was mad and sent into
England.</p>
<p>HAMLET Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there,
or if he do not, it’s no great matter there.</p>
<p>HAMLET Why?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN ’Twill not be seen in him: there the men are as mad as
he.</p>
<p>HAMLET How came he mad?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN Very strangely, they say.</p>
<p>HAMLET How strangely?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN Faith, e’en with losing his wits.</p>
<p>HAMLET Upon what ground 1689 ?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and
boy, thirty years.</p>
<p>HAMLET How long will a man lie i’th’earth ere he rot?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN I’faith, if he be not rotten before he die — as we have
many pocky 1690 corpses now-a-days, that will scarce hold the laying in
1691 — he will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner 1692 will
last you nine year.</p>
<p>HAMLET Why he more than another?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade that he
will keep out water a great while, and your water is a sore decayer of
your whoreson 1693 dead body. Here’s a skull 1694 now: this skull has
lain in the earth three-and-twenty years.</p>
<p>HAMLET Whose was it?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN A 1695 whoreson mad fellow’s it was: whose do you think
it was?</p>
<p>HAMLET Nay, I know not.</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! A poured a flagon of
Rhenish 1696 on my head once. This same skull, sir, this same skull,
sir, was Yorick’s skull, the king’s jester.</p>
<p>HAMLET This?</p>
<p>FIRST CLOWN E’en that.</p>
<p>HAMLET Let me see.— Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy 1697 . He hath borne me on his
back a thousand times — and how abhorred 1698 my imagination is! My
gorge 1699 rises 1700 at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I
know not how oft.— Where be your gibes now, your gambols, your songs,
your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar? No
one now to mock your own jeering? 1701 Quite chop-fallen 1702 ? Now get
you to my lady’s chamber and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to
this favour 1703 she must come. Make her laugh at that.— Prithee,
Horatio, tell me one thing.</p>
<p>Takes the skull</p>
<p>HORATIO What’s that, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET Dost thou think Alexander 1704 looked o’this fashion
i’th’earth?</p>
<p>HORATIO E’en so.</p>
<p>HAMLET And smelt so? Puh!</p>
<p>Places the skull on the ground or throws it down</p>
<p>HORATIO E’en so, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a
bung-hole 1705 ?</p>
<p>HORATIO ’Twere to consider too curiously 1706 to consider so.</p>
<p>HAMLET No, faith, not a jot, but to follow him thither with modesty
1707 enough, and likelihood to lead it, as thus: Alexander died,
Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth;
of earth we make loam 1708 , and why of that loam whereto he was
converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?</p>
<p>Imperial Caesar, dead and turned to clay,</p>
<p>Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.</p>
<p>O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,</p>
<p>Should patch a wall t’expel the winter’s flaw 1709 !</p>
<p>But soft, but soft, aside: here comes the king.</p>
<p>Enter King, Queen, Laertes, [a Priest] and a coffin with Lords
Attendant</p>
<p>The queen, the courtiers — who is that they follow?</p>
<p>And with such maimèd 1710 rites? This doth betoken</p>
<p>The corpse they follow did with desperate 1711 hand</p>
<p>Fordo 1712 it own life: ’twas of some estate 1713 .</p>
<p>Couch 1714 we awhile and mark.</p>
<p>LAERTES What ceremony else?</p>
<p>They hide</p>
<p>HAMLET That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.</p>
<p>Aside to Horatio</p>
<p>LAERTES What ceremony else?</p>
<p>PRIEST Her obsequies 1715 have been as far enlarged</p>
<p>As we have warrantise 1716 : her death was doubtful 1717 ,</p>
<p>And but that great command o’ersways 1718 the order</p>
<p>She should in ground unsanctified 1719 have lodged</p>
<p>Till the last trumpet 1720 . For 1721 charitable prayer,</p>
<p>Shards 1722 , flints and pebbles should be thrown on her.</p>
<p>Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,</p>
<p>Her maiden strewments 1723 and the bringing home</p>
<p>Of bell and burial 1724 .</p>
<p>LAERTES Must there no more be done?</p>
<p>PRIEST No more be done:</p>
<p>We should profane the service of the dead</p>
<p>To sing sage requiem 1725 and such rest 1726 to her</p>
<p>As to peace-parted 1727 souls.</p>
<p>LAERTES Lay her i’th’earth:</p>
<p>And from her fair and unpolluted flesh</p>
<p>May violets 1728 spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,</p>
<p>A minist’ring angel shall my sister be</p>
<p>When thou liest howling 1729 .</p>
<p>HAMLET What, the fair Ophelia!</p>
<p>Aside to Horatio</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Sweets to the sweet. Farewell!</p>
<p>Scatters flowers</p>
<p>I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife:</p>
<p>I thought thy bride-bed to have decked, sweet maid,</p>
<p>And not t’have strewed thy grave.</p>
<p>LAERTES O, treble woe</p>
<p>Fall ten times treble on that cursèd head</p>
<p>Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense 1730</p>
<p>Deprived thee of!— Hold off the earth awhile,</p>
<p>Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:</p>
<p>Leaps in the grave</p>
<p>Now pile your dust upon the quick 1731 and dead,</p>
<p>Till of this flat a mountain you have made,</p>
<p>To o’ertop old Pelion 1732 or the skyish head</p>
<p>Of blue Olympus.</p>
<p>HAMLET What is he whose grief</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>Bears such an emphasis 1733 ? Whose phrase of sorrow</p>
<p>Conjures the wand’ring stars 1734 , and makes them stand</p>
<p>Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,</p>
<p>Removes cloak?</p>
<p>Hamlet the Dane.</p>
<p>Leaps into the grave</p>
<p>LAERTES The devil take thy soul!</p>
<p>They fight</p>
<p>HAMLET Thou pray’st not well.</p>
<p>I prithee take thy fingers from my throat,</p>
<p>Sir: though I am not splenitive 1735 and rash,</p>
<p>Yet have I something in me dangerous,</p>
<p>Which let thy wiseness fear: away thy hand!</p>
<p>KING Pluck them asunder.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Hamlet, Hamlet!</p>
<p>HORATIO Good my lord, be quiet 1736 .</p>
<p>Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave</p>
<p>HAMLET Why I will fight with him upon this theme</p>
<p>Until my eyelids will no longer wag 1737 .</p>
<p>GERTRUDE O my son, what theme?</p>
<p>HAMLET I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers</p>
<p>Could not — with all their quantity of love —</p>
<p>Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?</p>
<p>KING O, he is mad, Laertes.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE For love of God, forbear him 1738 .</p>
<p>HAMLET Come, show me what thou’lt do:</p>
<p>Woo’t 1739 weep? Woo’t fight? Woo’t fast? Woo’t tear 1740
thyself?</p>
<p>Woo’t drink up eisel 1741 ? Eat a crocodile 1742 ?</p>
<p>I’ll do’t. Dost thou come here to whine?</p>
<p>To outface 1743 me with leaping in her grave?</p>
<p>Be buried quick with her, and so will I:</p>
<p>And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw</p>
<p>Millions of acres on us, till our ground 1744 ,</p>
<p>Singeing his pate against the burning zone 1745 ,</p>
<p>Make Ossa 1746 like a wart! Nay, an 1747 thou’lt mouth 1748 ,</p>
<p>I’ll rant as well as thou.</p>
<p>KING This is mere 1749 madness,</p>
<p>And thus awhile the fit will work on him:</p>
<p>Anon, as patient as the female dove</p>
<p>When that her golden couplets 1750 are disclosed 1751 ,</p>
<p>His silence will sit drooping.</p>
<p>HAMLET Hear you, sir:</p>
<p>To Laertes</p>
<p>What is the reason that you use 1752 me thus?</p>
<p>I loved you ever: but it is no matter.</p>
<p>Let Hercules himself do what he may,</p>
<p>The cat will mew and dog will have his day 1753 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KING I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.—</p>
<p>[Exit Horatio]</p>
<p>Strengthen your patience in 1754 our last night’s speech:</p>
<p>To Laertes</p>
<p>We’ll put the matter to the present push 1755 .—</p>
<p>Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.—</p>
<p>This grave shall have a living 1756 monument:</p>
<p>An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;</p>
<p>Till then, in patience our proceeding be.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
