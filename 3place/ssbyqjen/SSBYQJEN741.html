<h4 id="scene-4-613-running-scene-5">Scene 4 613 / running scene 5</h4>
<p>Flourish. Enter the French King 614 , the Dauphin, the Dukes of Berri
and Brittany, [the Constable 615 and others ]</p>
<p>FRENCH KING Thus comes the English with full power upon us,</p>
<p>And more than carefully it us concerns</p>
<p>To answer royally in our defences 616 .</p>
<p>Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Brittany,</p>
<p>Of Brabant and of Orléans, shall make forth,</p>
<p>And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch 617</p>
<p>To line 618 and new repair our towns of war</p>
<p>With men of courage and with means defendant 619 ,</p>
<p>For England his approaches 620 makes as fierce</p>
<p>As waters to the sucking of a gulf 621 .</p>
<p>It fits us 622 then to be as provident 623</p>
<p>As fear may teach us, out of late examples 624</p>
<p>Left by the fatal and neglected 625 English</p>
<p>Upon our fields.</p>
<p>DAUPHIN My most redoubted 626 father,</p>
<p>It is most meet 627 we arm us gainst the foe,</p>
<p>For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,</p>
<p>Though 628 war nor no known quarrel were in question,</p>
<p>But that defences, musters 629 , preparations,</p>
<p>Should be maintained, assembled and collected,</p>
<p>As were a war in expectation.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say ’tis meet we all go forth</p>
<p>To view the sick and feeble parts of France,</p>
<p>And let us do it with no show of fear ——</p>
<p>No, with no more than if we heard that England</p>
<p>Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance 630 ,</p>
<p>For, my good liege, she is so idly 631 kinged 632 ,</p>
<p>Her sceptre 633 so fantastically 634 borne</p>
<p>By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous 635 youth,</p>
<p>That fear attends 636 her not.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE O, peace, Prince Dauphin!</p>
<p>You are too much mistaken in this king.</p>
<p>Question your grace the late 637 ambassadors,</p>
<p>With what great state 638 he heard their embassy,</p>
<p>How well supplied with noble counsellors,</p>
<p>How modest 639 in exception 640 , and withal 641</p>
<p>How terrible 642 in constant resolution,</p>
<p>And you shall find his vanities forespent 643</p>
<p>Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,</p>
<p>Covering discretion with a coat of folly 644 ;</p>
<p>As gardeners do with ordure 645 hide those roots</p>
<p>That shall first spring and be most delicate.</p>
<p>DAUPHIN Well, ’tis not so, my lord high constable.</p>
<p>But though 646 we think it so, it is no matter.</p>
<p>In cases of defence ’tis best to weigh 647</p>
<p>The enemy more mighty than he seems,</p>
<p>So the proportions of defence are filled 648 ,</p>
<p>Which of a weak and niggardly projection 649</p>
<p>Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting 650</p>
<p>A little cloth.</p>
<p>FRENCH KING Think we 651 King Harry strong,</p>
<p>And, princes, look you 652 strongly arm to meet him.</p>
<p>The kindred of him hath been fleshed 653 upon us,</p>
<p>And he is bred out of that bloody strain 654</p>
<p>That haunted 655 us in our familiar 656 paths.</p>
<p>Witness our too much memorable shame</p>
<p>When Crécy battle fatally was struck 657 ,</p>
<p>And all our princes captived by the hand</p>
<p>Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales,</p>
<p>Whiles that his mountain 658 sire 659 , on mountain standing,</p>
<p>Up in the air, crowned with the golden sun,</p>
<p>Saw his heroical seed 660 , and smiled to see him</p>
<p>Mangle 661 the work of nature and deface</p>
<p>The patterns 662 that by God and by French fathers</p>
<p>Had twenty years been made. This 663 is a stem</p>
<p>Of that victorious stock, and let us fear</p>
<p>The native 664 mightiness and fate 665 of him.</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER Ambassadors from Harry King of England</p>
<p>Do crave admittance to your majesty.</p>
<p>FRENCH KING We’ll give them present 666 audience. Go, and bring
them.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Messenger and others ]</p>
<p>You see this chase is hotly followed 667 , friends.</p>
<p>DAUPHIN Turn head 668 , and stop pursuit, for coward dogs</p>
<p>Most spend their mouths 669 when what they seem to threaten</p>
<p>Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,</p>
<p>Take up the English short 670 , and let them know</p>
<p>Of what a monarchy you are the head.</p>
<p>Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin</p>
<p>As self-neglecting 671 .</p>
<p>Enter Exeter [and others ]</p>
<p>FRENCH KING From our brother of England?</p>
<p>EXETER From him, and thus he greets your majesty.</p>
<p>He wills 672 you, in the name of God Almighty,</p>
<p>That you divest 673 yourself and lay apart 674</p>
<p>The borrowed glories 675 that by gift of heaven,</p>
<p>By law of nature and of nations, longs 676</p>
<p>To him and to his heirs, namely, the crown</p>
<p>And all wide-stretchèd 677 honours that pertain</p>
<p>By custom and the ordinance of times 678</p>
<p>Unto the crown of France. That you may know</p>
<p>’Tis no sinister 679 nor no awkward 680 claim,</p>
<p>Picked from the worm-holes 681 of long-vanished days,</p>
<p>Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,</p>
<p>He sends you this most memorable line 682 ,</p>
<p>Gives a paper</p>
<p>In every branch truly demonstrative;</p>
<p>Willing you overlook this pedigree.</p>
<p>And when you find him evenly derived 683</p>
<p>From his most famed of famous ancestors,</p>
<p>Edward the Third, he bids you then resign</p>
<p>Your crown and kingdom, indirectly 684 held</p>
<p>From him the native 685 and true challenger.</p>
<p>FRENCH KING Or else what follows?</p>
<p>EXETER Bloody constraint 686 . For if you hide the crown</p>
<p>Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:</p>
<p>Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,</p>
<p>In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove 687 ,</p>
<p>That, if requiring 688 fail, he will compel,</p>
<p>And bids you, in the bowels 689 of the Lord,</p>
<p>Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy</p>
<p>On the poor souls for whom this hungry war</p>
<p>Opens his vasty jaws, and on your head</p>
<p>Turning 690 the widows’ tears, the orphans’ cries</p>
<p>The dead men’s blood, the pining maidens’ groans,</p>
<p>For husbands, fathers and betrothèd lovers,</p>
<p>That shall be swallowed in this controversy.</p>
<p>This is his claim, his threatening and my message ——</p>
<p>Unless the dauphin be in presence here,</p>
<p>To whom expressly I bring greeting too.</p>
<p>FRENCH KING For us, we will consider of this further:</p>
<p>Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent</p>
<p>Back to our brother of England.</p>
<p>DAUPHIN For the dauphin,</p>
<p>I stand here for him. What to him from England?</p>
<p>EXETER Scorn and defiance, slight 691 regard, contempt,</p>
<p>And anything that may not misbecome 692</p>
<p>The mighty sender, doth he prize you at 693 .</p>
<p>Thus says my king: an if 694 your father’s highness</p>
<p>Do not, in grant of all demands at large 695 ,</p>
<p>Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,</p>
<p>He’ll call you to so hot an answer of it,</p>
<p>That caves and womby 696 vaultages 697 of France</p>
<p>Shall chide your trespass and return your mock</p>
<p>In second accent 698 of his ordinance 699 .</p>
<p>DAUPHIN Say, if my father render fair return 700 ,</p>
<p>It is against my will, for I desire</p>
<p>Nothing but odds 701 with England. To that end,</p>
<p>As matching to his youth and vanity,</p>
<p>I did present him with the Paris balls.</p>
<p>EXETER He’ll make your Paris Louvre 702 shake for it,</p>
<p>Were it the mistress-court 703 of mighty Europe.</p>
<p>And be assured, you’ll find a diff’rence,</p>
<p>As we his subjects have in wonder found,</p>
<p>Between the promise of his greener days 704</p>
<p>And these he masters 705 now. Now he weighs time</p>
<p>Even to the utmost grain 706 : that you shall read 707</p>
<p>In your own losses, if he stay in France.</p>
<p>FRENCH KING Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full.</p>
<p>Flourish</p>
<p>EXETER Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king</p>
<p>Come here himself to question our delay;</p>
<p>For he is footed 708 in this land already.</p>
<p>FRENCH KING You shall be soon dispatched with fair conditions:</p>
<p>A night is but small breath 709 and little pause</p>
<p>To answer matters of this consequence.</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
<p>Enter Chorus</p>
<p>CHORUS Thus with imagined wing 710 our swift scene flies</p>
<p>In motion of no less celerity 711</p>
<p>Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen</p>
<p>The well-appointed 712 king at Dover 713 pier</p>
<p>Embark his royalty 714 , and his brave 715 fleet</p>
<p>With silken streamers 716 , the young Phoebus fanning 717 .</p>
<p>Play with 718 your fancies 719 , and in them behold</p>
<p>Upon the hempen tackle 720 ship-boys climbing;</p>
<p>Hear the shrill whistle 721 which doth order 722 give</p>
<p>To sounds confused. Behold the threaden 723 sails,</p>
<p>Borne with th’invisible and creeping wind,</p>
<p>Draw 724 the huge bottoms 725 through the furrowed sea,</p>
<p>Breasting the lofty surge 726 . O, do but think</p>
<p>You stand upon the rivage 727 and behold</p>
<p>A city on th’inconstant billows 728 dancing;</p>
<p>For so appears this fleet majestical,</p>
<p>Holding due course to Harfleur 729 . Follow, follow.</p>
<p>Grapple 730 your minds to sternage 731 of this navy,</p>
<p>And leave your England as dead midnight still,</p>
<p>Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,</p>
<p>Either past or not arrived to pith 732 and puissance,</p>
<p>For who is he, whose chin is but enriched</p>
<p>With one appearing hair 733 , that will not follow</p>
<p>These culled 734 and choice-drawn 735 cavaliers 736 to France?</p>
<p>Work 737 , work your thoughts, and therein see a siege:</p>
<p>Behold the ordnance 738 on their carriages 739 ,</p>
<p>With fatal mouths gaping on girded 740 Harfleur.</p>
<p>Suppose 741 th’ambassador from the French comes back,</p>
<p>Tells Harry that the king doth offer him</p>
<p>Katherine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,</p>
<p>Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.</p>
<p>The offer likes not 742 , and the nimble gunner</p>
<p>With linstock 743 now the devilish cannon touches,</p>
<p>Alarum 744 , and chambers 745 go off</p>
<p>And down goes all before them. Still be kind,</p>
<p>And eke out 746 our performance with your mind.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
