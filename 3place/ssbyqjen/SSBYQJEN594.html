18</h4>
<p>Enter Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian and Iras</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA What shall we do, Enobarbus?</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Think 1199 , and die.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Is Antony or we 1200 in fault for this?</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Antony only, that would make his will 1201</p>
<p>Lord of his reason. What though you fled</p>
<p>From that great face of war, whose several ranges 1202</p>
<p>Frighted each other? Why should he follow?</p>
<p>The itch of his affection 1203 should not then</p>
<p>Have nicked 1204 his captainship 1205 , at such a point,</p>
<p>When half to half the world opposed, he being</p>
<p>The meerèd question 1206 . ’Twas a shame no less</p>
<p>Than was his loss, to course 1207 your flying 1208 flags</p>
<p>And leave his navy gazing 1209 .</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Prithee, peace.</p>
<p>Enter the Ambassador with Antony</p>
<p>ANTONY Is that his answer?</p>
<p>AMBASSADOR Ay, my lord.</p>
<p>ANTONY The queen shall then have courtesy, so she</p>
<p>Will yield us up 1210 .</p>
<p>AMBASSADOR He says so.</p>
<p>ANTONY Let her know’t.</p>
<p>To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,</p>
<p>And he will fill thy wishes to the brim</p>
<p>With principalities.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA That head, my lord?</p>
<p>ANTONY To him again. Tell him he wears the rose</p>
<p>Of youth upon him, from which the world should note</p>
<p>Something particular 1211 : his coin, ships, legions,</p>
<p>May be a coward’s, whose ministers 1212 would prevail</p>
<p>Under the service of a child as soon</p>
<p>As i’th’command of Caesar. I dare him therefore</p>
<p>To lay his gay caparisons 1213 apart</p>
<p>And answer me declined 1214 , sword against sword,</p>
<p>Ourselves alone 1215 . I’ll write it: follow me.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Antony and Ambassador ]</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Yes, like enough, high-battled 1216 Caesar will</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Unstate his happiness 1217 , and be staged to th’show 1218</p>
<p>Against a sworder 1219 . I see men’s judgements are</p>
<p>A parcel of 1220 their fortunes, and things outward</p>
<p>Do draw the inward quality after them</p>
<p>To suffer all alike 1221 . That he should dream,</p>
<p>Knowing 1222 all measures 1223 , the full 1224 Caesar will</p>
<p>Answer 1225 his emptiness. Caesar, thou hast subdued</p>
<p>His judgement too.</p>
<p>Enter a Servant</p>
<p>SERVANT A messenger from Caesar.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA What, no more ceremony? See, my women,</p>
<p>Against the blown 1226 rose may they stop their nose</p>
<p>That kneeled unto the buds. Admit him, sir.</p>
<p>[Exit Servant ]</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Mine honesty 1227 and I begin to square 1228 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>The loyalty well held to fools does make</p>
<p>Our faith 1229 mere folly. Yet he that can endure</p>
<p>To follow with allegiance a fall’n lord</p>
<p>Does conquer him that did his master conquer,</p>
<p>And earns a place i’th’story 1230 1231 .</p>
<p>Enter Thidias</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Caesar’s will?</p>
<p>THIDIAS Hear it apart 1232 .</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA None but friends 1233 : say boldly.</p>
<p>THIDIAS So, haply 1234 , are they friends to Antony.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,</p>
<p>Or needs not us 1235 . If Caesar please, our master</p>
<p>Will leap to be his friend: for 1236 us, you know,</p>
<p>Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar’s 1237 .</p>
<p>THIDIAS So.</p>
<p>Thus then, thou most renowned: Caesar entreats</p>
<p>Not to consider in what case thou stand’st,</p>
<p>Further than he is Caesar 1238 .</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Go on: right royal 1239 .</p>
<p>THIDIAS He knows that you embrace not Antony</p>
<p>As you did love, but as you feared him.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA O!</p>
<p>THIDIAS The scars upon your honour, therefore, he</p>
<p>Does pity as constrain 1240 èd blemishes,</p>
<p>Not as deserved.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA He is a god and knows</p>
<p>What is most right 1241 : mine honour was not yielded,</p>
<p>But conquered merely 1242 .</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS To be sure of that,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky</p>
<p>That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for</p>
<p>Thy dearest quit 1243 thee.</p>
<p>Exit Enobarbus</p>
<p>THIDIAS Shall I say to Caesar</p>
<p>What you require 1244 of him? For he partly begs</p>
<p>To be desired 1245 to give. It much would please him</p>
<p>That of his fortunes you should make a staff</p>
<p>To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits</p>
<p>To hear from me you had left Antony</p>
<p>And put yourself under his shroud,</p>
<p>The universal landlord 1246 .</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA What’s your name?</p>
<p>THIDIAS My name is Thidias.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Most kind messenger,</p>
<p>Say to great Caesar this in deputation 1247 :</p>
<p>I kiss his conqu’ring hand: tell him I am prompt</p>
<p>To lay my crown at’s feet, and there to kneel:</p>
<p>Tell him from his all-obeying breath 1248 I hear</p>
<p>The doom 1249 of Egypt 1250 .</p>
<p>THIDIAS ’Tis your noblest course:</p>
<p>Wisdom and fortune combating together,</p>
<p>If that the former dare but what it 1251 can,</p>
<p>No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay</p>
<p>My duty on your hand.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Your Caesar’s father 1252 oft —</p>
<p>Offers him her hand</p>
<p>When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in 1253 —</p>
<p>Bestowed his lips on that unworthy place</p>
<p>As 1254 it rained kisses.</p>
<p>Enter Antony and Enobarbus</p>
<p>ANTONY Favours? 1255 By Jove that thunders!</p>
<p>What art thou, fellow 1256 ?</p>
<p>THIDIAS One that but performs</p>
<p>The bidding of the fullest 1257 man and worthiest</p>
<p>To have command obeyed.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS You will be whipped.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>ANTONY Approach there!— Ah, you kite 1258 !— Now, gods and
devils,</p>
<p>Calls for Servants</p>
<p>Authority melts from me of late. When I cried ‘Ho!’,</p>
<p>Like boys unto a muss 1259 , kings would start forth</p>
<p>And cry ‘Your will?’ Have you no ears? I am</p>
<p>Antony yet.— Take hence this jack 1260 and whip him.</p>
<p>Enter a Servant</p>
<p>Other Servants follow</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS ’Tis better playing with a lion’s whelp 1261</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Than with an old one dying.</p>
<p>ANTONY Moon and stars!</p>
<p>Whip him. Were’t twenty of the greatest tributaries 1262</p>
<p>That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them</p>
<p>So saucy 1263 with the hand of she here — what’s her name,</p>
<p>Since she was 1264 Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,</p>
<p>Till like a boy you see him cringe 1265 his face</p>
<p>And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.</p>
<p>THIDIAS Mark Antony!</p>
<p>ANTONY Tug him away: being whipped,</p>
<p>Bring him again. The jack of Caesar’s shall</p>
<p>Bear us an errand to him.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Servants ] with Thidias</p>
<p>You were half blasted 1266 ere I knew you: ha?</p>
<p>Have I my pillow left unpressed in Rome,</p>
<p>Forborne 1267 the getting 1268 of a lawful race 1269 ,</p>
<p>And by a gem of women, to be abused</p>
<p>By one that looks on feeders 1270 ?</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Good my lord—</p>
<p>ANTONY You have been a boggler 1271 ever,</p>
<p>But when we in our viciousness grow hard —</p>
<p>O, misery on’t! — the wise gods seel 1272 our eyes,</p>
<p>In our own filth drop our clear judgements, make us</p>
<p>Adore our errors, laugh at’s while we strut</p>
<p>To our confusion 1273 .</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA O, is’t come to this?</p>
<p>ANTONY I found you as a morsel cold upon</p>
<p>Dead Caesar’s trencher 1274 : nay, you were a fragment 1275</p>
<p>Of Gneius Pompey 1276 ’s, besides what hotter 1277 hours</p>
<p>Unregistered in vulgar fame 1278 you have</p>
<p>Luxuriously 1279 picked out 1280 . For I am sure,</p>
<p>Though you can guess what temperance 1281 should be,</p>
<p>You know not what it is.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Wherefore is this?</p>
<p>ANTONY To let a fellow that will take rewards</p>
<p>And say ‘God quit you!’ 1282 be familiar with</p>
<p>My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal 1283</p>
<p>And plighter 1284 of high 1285 hearts! O, that I were</p>
<p>Upon the hill of Basan 1286 , to outroar</p>
<p>The hornèd herd 1287 ! For I have savage cause 1288 ,</p>
<p>And to proclaim it civilly 1289 , were like</p>
<p>A haltered neck 1290 which does the hangman thank</p>
<p>For being yare 1291 about him.— Is he whipped?</p>
<p>Enter a Servant with Thidias</p>
<p>SERVANT Soundly, my lord.</p>
<p>ANTONY Cried he? And begged a 1292 pardon?</p>
<p>SERVANT He did ask favour.</p>
<p>ANTONY If that thy father live, let him repent</p>
<p>To Thidias</p>
<p>Thou wast not made his daughter, and be thou sorry</p>
<p>To follow Caesar in his triumph 1293 , since</p>
<p>Thou hast been whipped for following him. Henceforth</p>
<p>The white hand of a lady 1294 fever thee 1295 ,</p>
<p>Shake thou to look on’t. Get thee back to Caesar:</p>
<p>Tell him thy entertainment 1296 : look 1297 thou say</p>
<p>He makes me angry with him. For he seems</p>
<p>Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,</p>
<p>Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry,</p>
<p>And at this time most easy ’tis to do’t,</p>
<p>When my good stars that were my former guides</p>
<p>Have empty left their orbs 1298 and shot their fires</p>
<p>Into th’abysm 1299 of hell. If he mislike</p>
<p>My speech and what is done, tell him he has</p>
<p>Hipparchus, my enfranchèd bondman 1300 , whom</p>
<p>He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture,</p>
<p>As he shall like to quit 1301 me. Urge it thou.</p>
<p>Hence with thy stripes! Be gone!</p>
<p>Exit Thidias [with Servant ]</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Have you done yet?</p>
<p>ANTONY Alack, our terrene moon 1302 is now eclipsed</p>
<p>And it portends alone 1303 the fall of Antony.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA I must stay his time 1304 .</p>
<p>ANTONY To flatter Caesar would you mingle eyes 1305</p>
<p>With one that ties his points 1306 ?</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Not know me yet?</p>
<p>ANTONY Cold-hearted toward me?</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Ah, dear, if I be so,</p>
<p>From my cold heart let heaven engender hail</p>
<p>And poison it in the source, and the first stone</p>
<p>Drop in my neck 1307 : as it determines 1308 , so</p>
<p>Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion 1309 smite,</p>
<p>Till by degrees the memory of my womb,</p>
<p>Together with my brave Egyptians all,</p>
<p>By the discandying 1310 of this pelleted 1311 storm</p>
<p>Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile</p>
<p>Have buried them for prey 1312 !</p>
<p>ANTONY I am satisfied.</p>
<p>Caesar sets down 1313 in Alexandria, where</p>
<p>I will oppose his fate 1314 . Our force by land</p>
<p>Hath nobly held, our severed navy too</p>
<p>Have knit again, and fleet 1315 , threat’ning most sea-like 1316
.</p>
<p>Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?</p>
<p>If from the field I shall return once more</p>
<p>To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood 1317 :</p>
<p>I and my sword will earn our chronicle 1318 :</p>
<p>There’s hope in’t yet.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA That’s my brave lord!</p>
<p>ANTONY I will be treble-sinewed, hearted, breathed 1319 ,</p>
<p>And fight maliciously 1320 . For when mine hours</p>
<p>Were nice 1321 and lucky, men did ransom lives</p>
<p>Of me for jests 1322 . But now I’ll set my teeth</p>
<p>And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,</p>
<p>Let’s have one other gaudy 1323 night: call to me</p>
<p>All my sad 1324 captains: fill our bowls once more:</p>
<p>Let’s mock the midnight bell 1325 .</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA It is my birthday:</p>
<p>I had thought t’have held it poor 1326 , but since my lord</p>
<p>Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.</p>
<p>ANTONY We will yet do well.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Call all his noble captains to my lord!</p>
<p>To Charmian and Iras</p>
<p>ANTONY Do so, we’ll speak to them, and tonight I’ll force</p>
<p>The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,</p>
<p>There’s sap in’t yet 1327 . The next time I do fight</p>
<p>I’ll make death love me, for I will contend</p>
<p>Even with his pestilent scythe 1328 .</p>
<p>Exeunt [all but Enobarbus ]</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Now he’ll outstare 1329 the lightning. To be furious
1330</p>
<p>Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood</p>
<p>The dove will peck the estridge 1331 ; and I see still,</p>
<p>A diminution in our captain’s brain</p>
<p>Restores his heart 1332 . When valour preys on reason,</p>
<p>It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek</p>
<p>Some way to leave him.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
