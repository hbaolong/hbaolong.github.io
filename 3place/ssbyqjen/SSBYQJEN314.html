<h4 id="scene-2-721-running-scene-4">Scene 2 721 / running scene 4</h4>
<p>Enter Priam, Hector, Troilus, Paris and Helenus</p>
<p>PRIAM After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,</p>
<p>Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:</p>
<p>’Deliver 722 Helen, and all damage else —</p>
<p>As 723 honour, loss of time, travail 724 , expense,</p>
<p>Wounds, friends, and what else dear 725 that is consumed</p>
<p>In hot digestion of this cormorant 726 war —</p>
<p>Shall be struck 727 off.’ Hector, what say you to’t?</p>
<p>HECTOR Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I,</p>
<p>As far as touches my particular 728 ,</p>
<p>Yet, dread 729 Priam,</p>
<p>There is no lady of more softer bowels 730 ,</p>
<p>More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,</p>
<p>More ready to cry out ‘Who knows what follows?’</p>
<p>Than Hector is. The wound of peace is surety 731 ,</p>
<p>Surety secure 732 , but modest doubt 733 is called</p>
<p>The beacon of the wise, the tent 734 that searches</p>
<p>To th’bottom of the worst 735 . Let Helen go:</p>
<p>Since the first sword was drawn about this question 736 ,</p>
<p>Every tithe 737 soul 738 ’mongst many thousand dimes 739 ,</p>
<p>Hath been as dear as Helen — I mean, of ours.</p>
<p>If we have lost so many tenths of ours</p>
<p>To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,</p>
<p>Had it our name 740 , the value of one ten 741 ,</p>
<p>What merit’s in that reason 742 which denies</p>
<p>The yielding of her up?</p>
<p>TROILUS Fie 743 , fie, my brother!</p>
<p>Weigh you the worth and honour of a king</p>
<p>So great as our dread father in a scale</p>
<p>Of common ounces 744 ? Will you with counters 745 sum 746</p>
<p>The past proportion of his infinite 747 ,</p>
<p>And buckle in a waist most fathomless 748</p>
<p>With spans 749 and inches so diminutive</p>
<p>As fears and reasons 750 ? Fie, for godly shame!</p>
<p>HELENUS No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,</p>
<p>You are so empty of them. Should not our father</p>
<p>Bear the great sway of his affairs 751 with reasons,</p>
<p>Because your speech hath none that tells him so 752 ?</p>
<p>TROILUS You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest.</p>
<p>You fur your gloves with reason 753 . Here are your reasons:</p>
<p>You know an enemy intends you harm,</p>
<p>You know a sword employed is perilous,</p>
<p>And reason flies 754 the object 755 of all harm.</p>
<p>Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds</p>
<p>A Grecian and his sword, if he do set</p>
<p>The very wings of reason to his heels</p>
<p>And fly like chidden 756 Mercury 757 from Jove,</p>
<p>Or like a star disorbed 758 ? Nay, if we talk of reason,</p>
<p>Let’s shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour</p>
<p>Should have hard 759 hearts, would they but fat 760 their
thoughts</p>
<p>With this crammed 761 reason. Reason and respect</p>
<p>Makes livers 762 pale and lustihood 763 deject.</p>
<p>HECTOR Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost</p>
<p>The holding 764 .</p>
<p>TROILUS What’s aught 765 but as ’tis valued 766 ?</p>
<p>HECTOR But value dwells not in particular will 767 :</p>
<p>It holds his 768 estimate and dignity 769</p>
<p>As well 770 wherein ’tis precious of itself 771</p>
<p>As 772 in the prizer 773 . ’Tis mad idolatry</p>
<p>To make the service 774 greater than the god,</p>
<p>And the will dotes 775 that is inclinable</p>
<p>To 776 what infectiously itself affects 777 ,</p>
<p>Without some image of th’affected merit 778 .</p>
<p>TROILUS I 779 take today a wife, and my election 780</p>
<p>Is led on in the conduct 781 of my will 782 ;</p>
<p>My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,</p>
<p>Two traded 783 pilots ’twixt the dangerous shores</p>
<p>Of will and judgement. How may I avoid 784 ,</p>
<p>Although my will distaste 785 what it elected,</p>
<p>The wife I chose? There can be no evasion 786</p>
<p>To blench 787 from this and to stand firm by 788 honour:</p>
<p>We turn not back the silks upon the merchant</p>
<p>When we have spoiled them; nor the remainder viands 789</p>
<p>We do not throw in unrespective 790 sieve,</p>
<p>Because we now are full. It was thought meet 791</p>
<p>Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks;</p>
<p>Your breath of full consent bellied 792 his sails,</p>
<p>The seas and winds, old wranglers 793 , took a truce</p>
<p>And did him service; he touched 794 the ports desired,</p>
<p>And for 795 an old aunt 796 whom the Greeks held captive,</p>
<p>He brought a Grecian queen 797 , whose youth and freshness</p>
<p>Wrinkles Apollo’s 798 and makes stale the morning.</p>
<p>Why keep we her? The Grecians keep our aunt:</p>
<p>Is she worth keeping? Why, she is a pearl</p>
<p>Whose price hath launched above a thousand ships 799 ,</p>
<p>And turned crowned kings to merchants.</p>
<p>If you’ll avouch 800 ’twas wisdom Paris went —</p>
<p>As you must needs 801 , for you all cried ‘Go, go’ —</p>
<p>If you’ll confess he brought home noble prize —</p>
<p>As you must needs, for you all clapped your hands</p>
<p>And cried ‘Inestimable!’ — why do you now</p>
<p>The issue 802 of your proper wisdoms rate,</p>
<p>And do a deed that fortune never did 803 ,</p>
<p>Beggar the estimation 804 which you prized</p>
<p>Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,</p>
<p>That we have stol’n what we do fear to keep!</p>
<p>But 805 thieves unworthy of a thing so stol’n,</p>
<p>That in their country did them that disgrace,</p>
<p>We fear to warrant in our native place 806 !</p>
<p>Enter Cassandra [at a distance ] with her hair about her ears 807</p>
<p>CASSANDRA Cry, Trojans, cry!</p>
<p>PRIAM What noise? What shriek is this?</p>
<p>TROILUS ’Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.</p>
<p>CASSANDRA Cry, Trojans!</p>
<p>Coming forward</p>
<p>HECTOR It is Cassandra.</p>
<p>CASSANDRA Cry, Trojans, cry! Lend me ten thousand eyes,</p>
<p>And I will fill them with prophetic tears.</p>
<p>HECTOR Peace, sister, peace!</p>
<p>CASSANDRA Virgins and boys, mid-age 808 and wrinkled old,</p>
<p>Soft 809 infancy, that nothing can but cry,</p>
<p>Add to my clamour! Let us pay betimes 810</p>
<p>A moiety 811 of that mass of moan 812 to come.</p>
<p>Cry, Trojans, cry! Practise 813 your eyes with tears!</p>
<p>Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilium stand:</p>
<p>Our firebrand 814 brother, Paris, burns us all.</p>
<p>Cry, Trojans, cry! A Helen and a woe;</p>
<p>Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>HECTOR Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains 815</p>
<p>Of divination in our sister work 816</p>
<p>Some touches of remorse 817 ? Or is your blood 818</p>
<p>So madly hot that no discourse of reason,</p>
<p>Nor fear of bad success 819 in a bad cause,</p>
<p>Can qualify the same 820 ?</p>
<p>TROILUS Why, brother Hector,</p>
<p>We may not think 821 the justness of each act</p>
<p>Such and no other than event doth form it 822 ,</p>
<p>Nor once deject 823 the courage of our minds</p>
<p>Because Cassandra’s mad: her brainsick raptures 824</p>
<p>Cannot distaste 825 the goodness 826 of a quarrel</p>
<p>Which hath our several 827 honours all engaged</p>
<p>To make it gracious 828 . For my private part 829 ,</p>
<p>I am no more touched 830 than all Priam’s sons:</p>
<p>And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us</p>
<p>Such things as might offend the weakest spleen</p>
<p>To fight for and maintain 831 .</p>
<p>PARIS Else 832 might the world convince 833 of levity 834</p>
<p>As well 835 my undertakings as 836 your counsels 837 :</p>
<p>But I attest 838 the gods, your full consent</p>
<p>Gave wings to my propension 839 and cut off</p>
<p>All fears attending on so dire 840 a project.</p>
<p>For what, alas, can these my single arms 841 842 ?</p>
<p>What propugnation 843 is in one man’s valour</p>
<p>To stand the push 844 and enmity of those</p>
<p>This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,</p>
<p>Were I alone to pass 845 the difficulties</p>
<p>And had as ample power as I have will,</p>
<p>Paris should ne’er retract what he hath done,</p>
<p>Nor faint 846 in the pursuit.</p>
<p>PRIAM Paris, you speak</p>
<p>Like one besotted 847 on your sweet delights:</p>
<p>You have the honey still, but these 848 the gall 849 ,</p>
<p>So 850 to be valiant is no praise 851 at all.</p>
<p>PARIS Sir, I propose 852 not merely to myself</p>
<p>The pleasures such a beauty brings with it,</p>
<p>But I would have the soil 853 of her fair rape 854</p>
<p>Wiped off in honourable keeping her 855 .</p>
<p>What treason were it 856 to the ransacked 857 queen,</p>
<p>Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,</p>
<p>Now to deliver her possession 858 up</p>
<p>On terms of base compulsion! Can it be</p>
<p>That so degenerate a strain 859 as this</p>
<p>Should once set footing in your generous 860 bosoms?</p>
<p>There’s not the meanest spirit 861 on our party 862</p>
<p>Without 863 a heart to dare or sword to draw</p>
<p>When Helen is defended, nor none so noble</p>
<p>Whose life were ill bestowed 864 or death unfamed 865</p>
<p>Where Helen is the subject. Then, I say,</p>
<p>Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,</p>
<p>The world’s large spaces cannot parallel.</p>
<p>HECTOR Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,</p>
<p>And on the cause and question now in hand</p>
<p>Have glozed 866 , but superficially, not much</p>
<p>Unlike young men, whom Aristotle 867 thought</p>
<p>Unfit to hear moral philosophy:</p>
<p>The reasons you allege 868 do more conduce</p>
<p>To the hot passion of distempered 869 blood</p>
<p>Than to make up a free determination 870</p>
<p>’Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge</p>
<p>Have ears more deaf than adders 871 to the voice</p>
<p>Of any true decision. Nature craves</p>
<p>All dues 872 be rendered 873 to their owners: now,</p>
<p>What nearer 874 debt in all humanity</p>
<p>Than wife is to the husband? If this law</p>
<p>Of nature be corrupted through affection 875 ,</p>
<p>And that 876 great minds, of partial 877 indulgence</p>
<p>To their benumbèd 878 wills, resist the same 879 ,</p>
<p>There is a law in each well-ordered nation</p>
<p>To curb those raging appetites that are</p>
<p>Most disobedient and refractory 880 .</p>
<p>If Helen then be wife to Sparta’s king,</p>
<p>As it is known she is, these moral laws</p>
<p>Of nature and of nation speak aloud</p>
<p>To have her back returned: thus to persist</p>
<p>In doing wrong extenuates not 881 wrong,</p>
<p>But makes it much more heavy 882 . Hector’s opinion</p>
<p>Is this in way of 883 truth, yet ne’ertheless,</p>
<p>My spritely 884 brethren, I propend 885 to you</p>
<p>In resolution to keep Helen still 886 ,</p>
<p>For ’tis a cause that hath no mean dependence 887</p>
<p>Upon our joint 888 and several 889 dignities 890 .</p>
<p>TROILUS Why, there you touched the life of our design 891 :</p>
<p>Were it not glory that we more affected 892</p>
<p>Than the performance of our heaving spleens 893 ,</p>
<p>I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood</p>
<p>Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,</p>
<p>She is a theme 894 of honour and renown,</p>
<p>A spur to valiant and magnanimous 895 deeds,</p>
<p>Whose present courage 896 may beat down our foes,</p>
<p>And fame in time to come canonize 897 us,</p>
<p>For I presume brave Hector would not lose</p>
<p>So rich advantage of a promised glory</p>
<p>As smiles upon the forehead 898 of this action</p>
<p>For 899 the wide world’s revenue 900 .</p>
<p>HECTOR I am yours,</p>
<p>You valiant offspring of great Priamus.</p>
<p>I have a roisting 901 challenge sent amongst</p>
<p>The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks</p>
<p>Will 902 strike amazement to their drowsy spirits.</p>
<p>I was advertised 903 their great general 904 slept</p>
<p>Whilst emulation 905 in the army crept:</p>
<p>This, I presume, will wake him.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
