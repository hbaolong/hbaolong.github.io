<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-11">Scene 1 / running scene 11</h4>
<p>Enter Baptista, Vincentio, Gremio, the Pedant, Lucentio and Bianca,
[Petruchio, Katherina,Hortensio, ] Tranio, Biondello, Grumio and Widow.
The Servingmen with Tranio bringing in a banquet 1252</p>
<p>LUCENTIO At last, though long 1253 , our jarring notes agree,</p>
<p>And time it is, when raging war is done,</p>
<p>To smile at scapes 1254 and perils overblown 1255 .</p>
<p>My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,</p>
<p>While I with selfsame kindness 1256 welcome thine.</p>
<p>Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina,</p>
<p>And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,</p>
<p>Feast with 1257 the best, and welcome to my house.</p>
<p>My banquet is to close 1258 our stomachs up</p>
<p>After our great good cheer 1259 . Pray you sit down,</p>
<p>For now we sit to chat as well as eat.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Padua affords nothing but what is kind.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO For both our sakes, I would that word were true.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Now, for my life, Hortensio fears 1260 his widow.</p>
<p>WIDOW Then never trust me if I be afeard 1261 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO You are very sensible 1262 , and yet you miss my sense:</p>
<p>I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.</p>
<p>WIDOW He that is giddy thinks the world turns round 1263 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Roundly 1264 replied.</p>
<p>KATE Mistress, how mean you that?</p>
<p>WIDOW Thus I conceive by him 1265 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?</p>
<p>HORTENSIO My widow says, thus she conceives her tale 1266 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Very well mended 1267 . Kiss him for that, good widow.</p>
<p>KATE ‘He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.’</p>
<p>I pray you tell me what you meant by that.</p>
<p>WIDOW Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,</p>
<p>Measures my husband’s sorrow by his woe:</p>
<p>And now you know my meaning.</p>
<p>KATE A very mean 1268 meaning.</p>
<p>WIDOW Right, I mean you.</p>
<p>KATE And I am mean indeed, respecting you 1269 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO To her 1270 , Kate!</p>
<p>HORTENSIO To her, widow!</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO A hundred marks 1271 , my Kate does put her down 1272 .</p>
<p>HORTENSIO That’s my office 1273 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Spoke like an officer. Ha’ to thee, lad!</p>
<p>Drinks to Hortensio</p>
<p>BAPTISTA How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?</p>
<p>GREMIO Believe me, sir, they butt 1274 together well.</p>
<p>BIANCA Head, and butt 1275 ! An hasty-witted body 1276</p>
<p>Would say your head and butt were head and horn 1277 .</p>
<p>VINCENTIO Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?</p>
<p>BIANCA Ay, but not frighted me: therefore I’ll sleep again.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Nay, that you shall not. Since you have begun,</p>
<p>Have at you 1278 for a bitter 1279 jest or two.</p>
<p>BIANCA Am I your bird 1280 ? I mean to shift my bush 1281 ,</p>
<p>And then pursue me as you draw your bow 1282 .</p>
<p>You are welcome all.</p>
<p>Exeunt Bianca, [Katherina and Widow ]</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO She hath prevented 1283 me. Here, Signior Tranio,</p>
<p>This bird you aimed at, though you hit 1284 her not:</p>
<p>Therefore a health 1285 to all that shot and missed.</p>
<p>Makes a toast</p>
<p>TRANIO O, sir, Lucentio slipped 1286 me like his greyhound,</p>
<p>Which runs himself and catches for his master.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO A good swift simile, but something currish 1287 .</p>
<p>TRANIO ’Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:</p>
<p>’Tis thought your deer 1288 does hold you at a bay 1289 .</p>
<p>BAPTISTA O, O, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO I thank thee for that gird 1290 , good Tranio.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO A has a little galled 1291 me, I confess.</p>
<p>And as the jest did glance away from 1292 me,</p>
<p>’Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Now, in good sadness 1293 , son Petruchio,</p>
<p>I think thou hast the veriest 1294 shrew of all.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance 1295</p>
<p>Let’s each one send unto his wife,</p>
<p>And he whose wife is most obedient</p>
<p>To come at first when he doth send for her,</p>
<p>Shall win the wager which we will propose.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Content. What’s the wager?</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Twenty crowns.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Twenty crowns?</p>
<p>I’ll venture so much of 1296 my hawk or hound,</p>
<p>But twenty times so much upon my wife.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO A hundred then.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Content.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO A match! ’Tis done.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Who shall begin?</p>
<p>LUCENTIO That will I.</p>
<p>Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.</p>
<p>BIONDELLO I go.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Son, I’ll be your half 1297 , Bianca comes.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO I’ll have no halves. I’ll bear it all myself.</p>
<p>Enter Biondello</p>
<p>How now? What news?</p>
<p>BIONDELLO Sir, my mistress sends you word</p>
<p>That she is busy and she cannot come.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO How? 1298 She’s busy and she cannot come?</p>
<p>Is that an answer?</p>
<p>GREMIO Ay, and a kind one too.</p>
<p>Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO I hope better.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife</p>
<p>To come to me forthwith.</p>
<p>Exit Biondello</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO O, ho, entreat her?</p>
<p>Nay, then she must needs 1299 come.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO I am afraid, sir,</p>
<p>Do what you can,</p>
<p>Enter Biondello</p>
<p>yours will not be entreated.</p>
<p>Now, where’s my wife?</p>
<p>BIONDELLO She says you have some goodly jest in hand.</p>
<p>She will not come. She bids you come to her.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Worse and worse, she will not come! O, vile,</p>
<p>Intolerable, not to be endured!</p>
<p>Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress,</p>
<p>Say, I command her come to me.</p>
<p>Exit [Grumio ]</p>
<p>HORTENSIO I know her answer.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO What?</p>
<p>HORTENSIO She will not.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO The fouler fortune mine 1300 , and there an end.</p>
<p>Enter Katherina</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Now, by my holidame 1301 , here comes Katherina!</p>
<p>KATE What is your will, sir, that you send for me?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Where is your sister, and Hortensio’s wife?</p>
<p>KATE They sit conferring 1302 by the parlour fire.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Go fetch them hither. If they deny to come,</p>
<p>Swinge 1303 me them soundly forth unto their husbands.</p>
<p>Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.</p>
<p>[Exit Katherina ]</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,</p>
<p>And awful 1304 rule and right 1305 supremacy,</p>
<p>And, to be short, what not 1306 that’s sweet and happy.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Now, fair befall thee 1307 , good Petruchio;</p>
<p>The wager thou hast won, and I will add</p>
<p>Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns,</p>
<p>Another dowry to another daughter,</p>
<p>For she is changed, as she had never been 1308 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Nay, I will win my wager better yet</p>
<p>And show more sign of her obedience,</p>
<p>Her new-built virtue and obedience.</p>
<p>Enter Kate, Bianca and Widow</p>
<p>See where she comes and brings your froward wives</p>
<p>As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.—</p>
<p>Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not.</p>
<p>Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.</p>
<p>Kate throws the cap on the ground</p>
<p>WIDOW Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,</p>
<p>Till I be brought to such a silly pass 1309 !</p>
<p>BIANCA Fie! What a foolish 1310 duty call you this?</p>
<p>LUCENTIO I would your duty were as foolish too:</p>
<p>The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,</p>
<p>Hath cost me five hundred crowns since suppertime.</p>
<p>BIANCA The more fool you for laying 1311 on my duty.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Katherine, I charge thee tell these headstrong women</p>
<p>What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.</p>
<p>WIDOW Come, come, you’re mocking. We will have no telling.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Come on, I say, and first begin with her.</p>
<p>WIDOW She shall not.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO I say she shall, and first begin with her.</p>
<p>KATE Fie, fie! Unknit 1312 that threat’ning unkind 1313 brow,</p>
<p>To the Widow</p>
<p>And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,</p>
<p>To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.</p>
<p>It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads 1314 ,</p>
<p>Confounds thy fame 1315 as whirlwinds shake fair buds,</p>
<p>And in no sense is meet 1316 or amiable.</p>
<p>A woman moved 1317 is like a fountain troubled,</p>
<p>Muddy, ill-seeming 1318 , thick, bereft of beauty,</p>
<p>And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty</p>
<p>Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.</p>
<p>Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,</p>
<p>Thy head, thy sovereign: one that cares for thee,</p>
<p>And for thy maintenance commits his body</p>
<p>To painful 1319 labour both by sea and land,</p>
<p>To watch 1320 the night in storms, the day in cold,</p>
<p>Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,</p>
<p>And craves no other tribute at thy hands</p>
<p>But love, fair looks and true obedience;</p>
<p>Too little payment for so great a debt.—</p>
<p>Such duty as the subject owes the prince</p>
<p>To all?</p>
<p>Even such a woman oweth to her husband.</p>
<p>And when she is froward, peevish 1321 , sullen, sour,</p>
<p>And not obedient to his honest 1322 will,</p>
<p>What is she but a foul contending rebel</p>
<p>And graceless 1323 traitor to her loving lord?</p>
<p>I am ashamed that women are so simple 1324</p>
<p>To offer war where they should kneel for peace,</p>
<p>Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway 1325 ,</p>
<p>When they are bound 1326 to serve, love and obey.</p>
<p>Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,</p>
<p>Unapt 1327 to toil and trouble in the world,</p>
<p>But that our soft 1328 conditions 1329 and our hearts</p>
<p>Should well agree with our external parts?—</p>
<p>Come, come, you froward and unable 1330 worms,</p>
<p>To all the Women</p>
<p>My mind hath been as big 1331 as one of yours,</p>
<p>My heart as great, my reason haply 1332 more,</p>
<p>To bandy 1333 word for word and frown for frown;</p>
<p>But now I see our lances are but straws,</p>
<p>Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,</p>
<p>That seeming to be 1334 most which we indeed least are.</p>
<p>Then vail your stomachs 1335 , for it is no boot 1336 ,</p>
<p>And place your hands below your husband’s foot:</p>
<p>In token of which duty, if he please,</p>
<p>My hand is ready, may it do him ease 1337 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Why, there’s a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.</p>
<p>They kiss</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Well, go thy ways 1338 , old lad, for thou shalt ha’t 1339
.</p>
<p>VINCENTIO ’Tis a good hearing when children are toward 1340 .</p>
<p>LUCENTIO But a harsh hearing when women are froward.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Come, Kate, we’ll to bed.</p>
<p>We three 1341 are married, but you two are sped 1342 .</p>
<p>’Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white 1343 .</p>
<p>To Lucentio</p>
<p>And being a winner, God give you goodnight!</p>
<p>Exeunt Petruchio [and Katherina ]</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Now, go thy ways. Thou hast tamed a curst shrew 1344 .</p>
<p>LUCENTIO ’Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster , and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading ‘bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
