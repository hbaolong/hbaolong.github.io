<h4 id="scene-6-1016-running-scene-8">Scene 6 1016 / running scene
8</h4>
<p>Enter Captains, English and Welsh: Gower and Fluellen</p>
<p>GOWER How now, Captain Fluellen? Come you from the bridge 1017 ?</p>
<p>FLUELLEN I assure you, there is very excellent services 1018
committed at the bridge.</p>
<p>GOWER Is the Duke of Exeter safe?</p>
<p>FLUELLEN The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous 1019 as Agamemnon 1020
, and a man that I love and honour with my soul and my heart and my duty
and my life and my living and my uttermost power. He is not —— God be
praised and blessed! —— any hurt in the world, but keeps the bridge most
valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient lieutenant
there at the pridge 1021 , I think in my very conscience he is as
valiant a man as Mark Antony 1022 , and he is a man of no estimation
1023 in the world, but I did see him do as gallant service.</p>
<p>GOWER What do you call him?</p>
<p>FLUELLEN He is called Aunchient 1024 Pistol.</p>
<p>GOWER I know him not.</p>
<p>Enter Pistol</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Here is the man.</p>
<p>PISTOL Captain, I thee beseech to do me favours:</p>
<p>The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Ay, I praise God, and I have merited some love at his
hands.</p>
<p>PISTOL Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,</p>
<p>And of buxom 1025 valour, hath, by cruel fate,</p>
<p>And giddy 1026 Fortune’s furious 1027 fickle wheel,</p>
<p>That goddess blind 1028 ,</p>
<p>That stands upon the rolling restless stone 1029 ——</p>
<p>FLUELLEN By your patience 1030 , Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is painted
blind, with a muffler 1031 afore her eyes, to signify to you that
Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a wheel, to signify to
you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning and inconstant, and
mutability, and variation. And her foot, look you, is fixed upon a
spherical stone, which rolls and rolls and rolls. In good truth, the
poet makes a most excellent description of it. Fortune is an excellent
moral 1032 .</p>
<p>PISTOL Fortune is Bardolph’s foe, and frowns on him,</p>
<p>For he hath stol’n a pax 1033 ,</p>
<p>And hangèd must a be —— a damnèd death!</p>
<p>Let gallows gape for dog, let man go free</p>
<p>And let not hemp 1034 his wind-pipe suffocate.</p>
<p>But Exeter hath given the doom 1035 of death</p>
<p>For pax of little price.</p>
<p>Therefore, go speak —— the duke will hear thy voice ——</p>
<p>And let not Bardolph’s vital thread 1036 be cut</p>
<p>With edge of penny cord 1037 and vile reproach 1038 .</p>
<p>Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite 1039 .</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Aunchient Pistol, I do partly 1040 understand your
meaning.</p>
<p>PISTOL Why then, rejoice therefore.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice at, for
if 1041 , look you, he were my brother, I would desire the duke to use
his good pleasure and put him to execution; for discipline ought to be
used.</p>
<p>PISTOL Die and be damned! And figo 1042 for thy friendship!</p>
<p>FLUELLEN It is well.</p>
<p>PISTOL The fig of Spain!</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Very good.</p>
<p>GOWER Why, this is an arrant 1043 counterfeit 1044 rascal. I remember
him now: a bawd 1045 , a cutpurse 1046 .</p>
<p>FLUELLEN I’ll assure you, a uttered as prave words at the pridge as
you shall see in a summer’s day 1047 . But it is very well. What he has
spoke to me, that is well, I warrant 1048 you, when time is serve 1049
.</p>
<p>GOWER Why, ‘tis a gull 1050 , a fool, a rogue, that now and then goes
to the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the form of
a soldier; and such fellows are perfect 1051 in the great commanders’
names, and they will learn you 1052 by rote where services were done; at
such and such a sconce 1053 , at such a breach, at such a convoy 1054 ,
who came off 1055 bravely, who was shot, who disgraced, what terms the
enemy stood on 1056 —— and this they con 1057 perfectly in the phrase of
war 1058 , which they trick up 1059 with new-tuned 1060 oaths. And what
a beard of the general’s cut 1061 and a horrid 1062 suit 1063 of the
camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-washed 1064 wits is wonderful
to be thought on. But you must learn to know such slanders of the age
1065 , or else you may be marvellously mistook 1066 .</p>
<p>FLUELLEN I tell you what, Captain Gower, I do perceive he is not the
man that he would gladly make show to the world he is: if I find a hole
in his coat 1067 , I will tell him my mind. Hark you, the king is coming
and I must speak with him from 1068 the pridge.</p>
<p>Drum heard</p>
<p>Drum and colours 1069 . Enter the King and his poor 1070 Soldiers
[and Gloucester ]</p>
<p>God pless your majesty!</p>
<p>KING HENRY V How now, Fluellen? Cam’st thou from the bridge?</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter has very
gallantly maintained the pridge; the French is gone off, look you, and
there is gallant and most prave passages 1071 . Marry, th’athversary was
have 1072 possession of the pridge, but he is enforced 1073 to retire,
and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge. I can tell your majesty,
the duke is a prave man.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V What men have you lost, Fluellen?</p>
<p>FLUELLEN The perdition 1074 of th’athversary hath been very great,
reasonable great. Marry, for my part, I think the duke hath lost never a
man 1075 , but one that is like 1076 to be executed for robbing a
church, one Bardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is all
bubukles 1077 and whelks 1078 and knobs 1079 and flames o’ fire 1080 ,
and his lips blows 1081 at his nose and it is like a coal of fire,
sometimes plue and sometimes red. But his nose is executed and his
fire’s out.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V We would have all such offenders so cut off 1082 : and
we give express charge 1083 , that in our marches through the country,
there be nothing compelled 1084 from the villages, nothing taken but
paid for, none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language;
for when lenity 1085 and cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler
gamester 1086 is the soonest winner.</p>
<p>Tucket 1087 . Enter Montjoy</p>
<p>MONTJOY You know me by my habit 1088 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Well then, I know thee: what shall I know of 1089
thee?</p>
<p>MONTJOY My master’s mind.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Unfold 1090 it.</p>
<p>MONTJOY Thus says my king: ‘Say thou to Harry of England, though we
seemed dead, we did but sleep. Advantage 1091 is a better soldier than
rashness. Tell him we could have rebuked 1092 him at Harfleur, but that
we thought not good to bruise an injury 1093 till it were full ripe. Now
we speak upon our cue 1094 , and our voice is imperial: England shall
repent his folly, see his weakness, and admire our sufferance 1095 . Bid
him therefore consider of his ransom, which must proportion 1096 the
losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have
digested 1097 ; which in weight to re-answer 1098 , his pettiness 1099
would bow under. For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for
th’effusion of our blood, the muster 1100 of his kingdom too faint a
number; and for our disgrace, his own person, kneeling at our feet, but
a weak and worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance, and tell him,
for conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation is
pronounced.’ So far 1101 my king and master; so much my office.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V What is thy name? I know thy quality 1102 .</p>
<p>MONTJOY Montjoy.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back,</p>
<p>And tell thy king I do not seek him now,</p>
<p>But could be willing to march on to Calais</p>
<p>Without impeachment 1103 . For, to say the sooth 1104 ,</p>
<p>Though ’tis no wisdom to confess so much</p>
<p>Unto an enemy of craft and vantage 1105 ,</p>
<p>My people are with sickness much enfeebled,</p>
<p>My numbers lessened, and those few I have,</p>
<p>Almost no better than so many French;</p>
<p>Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,</p>
<p>I thought upon one pair of English legs</p>
<p>Did march three Frenchmen.—— Yet, forgive me, God,</p>
<p>That I do brag thus. This your air of France</p>
<p>Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.——</p>
<p>Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;</p>
<p>My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk 1106 ;</p>
<p>My army but a weak and sickly guard:</p>
<p>Yet, God before 1107 , tell him we will come on,</p>
<p>Though France himself and such another neighbour</p>
<p>Stand in our way. There’s for thy labour, Montjoy.</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>Go bid thy master well advise himself.</p>
<p>If we may pass, we will. If we be hindered,</p>
<p>We shall your tawny 1108 ground with your red blood</p>
<p>Discolour. And so Montjoy, fare you well.</p>
<p>The sum of all our answer is but this:</p>
<p>We would not seek a battle, as we are,</p>
<p>Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it.</p>
<p>So tell your master.</p>
<p>MONTJOY I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER I hope they will not come upon us now.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V We are in God’s hand, brother, not in theirs.</p>
<p>March to the bridge, it now draws toward night.</p>
<p>Beyond the river we’ll encamp ourselves,</p>
<p>And on tomorrow, bid them 1109 march away.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
