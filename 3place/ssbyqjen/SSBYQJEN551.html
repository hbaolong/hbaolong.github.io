<h4 id="scene-3-225-running-scene-3">Scene 3 225 / running scene 3</h4>
<p>Enter Duke, Senators and Officers</p>
<p>With torches</p>
<p>DUKE There’s no composition 226 in this news</p>
<p>They sit at a table</p>
<p>That gives them 227 credit.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Indeed, they are disproportioned 228 ;</p>
<p>My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.</p>
<p>DUKE And mine a hundred forty.</p>
<p>SECOND SENATOR And mine two hundred:</p>
<p>But though they jump 229 not on a just account 230 —</p>
<p>As in these cases where the aim 231 reports,</p>
<p>’Tis oft with difference — yet do they all confirm</p>
<p>A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.</p>
<p>DUKE Nay, it is possible enough to judgement:</p>
<p>I do not so secure me in the error</p>
<p>But the main article I do approve</p>
<p>In fearful sense 232 .</p>
<p>SAILOR What ho, what ho, what ho!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>Enter Sailor</p>
<p>OFFICER A messenger from the galleys.</p>
<p>DUKE Now? What’s the business?</p>
<p>SAILOR The Turkish preparation 233 makes for Rhodes:</p>
<p>So was I bid report here to the state</p>
<p>By Signior Angelo.</p>
<p>[Exit Sailor ]</p>
<p>DUKE How say you by 234 this change?</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR This cannot be</p>
<p>By no assay 235 of reason: ’tis a pageant 236 ,</p>
<p>To keep us in false gaze 237 . When we consider</p>
<p>Th’importancy 238 of Cyprus to the Turk,</p>
<p>And let ourselves again but understand</p>
<p>That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,</p>
<p>So may he with more facile question bear it,</p>
<p>For that 239 it 240 stands not in such warlike brace 241 ,</p>
<p>But altogether lacks th’abilities 242</p>
<p>That Rhodes is dressed in 243 : if we make thought of this,</p>
<p>We must not think the Turk is so unskilful</p>
<p>To leave that latest 244 which concerns him first,</p>
<p>Neglecting an attempt 245 of ease and gain</p>
<p>To wake and wage 246 a danger profitless.</p>
<p>DUKE Nay, in all confidence, he’s not for Rhodes.</p>
<p>OFFICER Here is more news.</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER The Ottomites 247 , reverend and gracious 248 ,</p>
<p>Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,</p>
<p>Have there injointed them 249 with an after 250 fleet.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?</p>
<p>MESSENGER Of thirty sail: and now they do restem</p>
<p>Their backward course 251 , bearing with frank 252 appearance</p>
<p>Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,</p>
<p>Your trusty and most valiant servitor 253 ,</p>
<p>With his free 254 duty recommends 255 you thus,</p>
<p>And prays you to believe him.</p>
<p>[Exit Messenger ]</p>
<p>DUKE ’Tis certain then for Cyprus.</p>
<p>Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR He’s now in Florence.</p>
<p>DUKE Write from us to him: post-post-haste 256 , dispatch!</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.</p>
<p>Enter Brabantio, Othello, Cassio, Iago, Rodorigo and Officers</p>
<p>DUKE Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you</p>
<p>Against the general enemy Ottoman 257 .—</p>
<p>I did not see you: welcome, gentle 258 signior,</p>
<p>To Brabantio</p>
<p>We lacked your counsel and your help tonight.</p>
<p>BRABANTIO So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me:</p>
<p>Neither my place 259 nor aught 260 I heard of business</p>
<p>Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care 261</p>
<p>Take hold on me, for my particular 262 grief</p>
<p>Is of so floodgate 263 and o’erbearing nature</p>
<p>That it engluts 264 and swallows other sorrows</p>
<p>And it is still itself 265 .</p>
<p>DUKE Why? What’s the matter?</p>
<p>BRABANTIO My daughter! O, my daughter!</p>
<p>SENATORS Dead?</p>
<p>BRABANTIO Ay, to me:</p>
<p>She is abused 266 , stol’n from me and corrupted</p>
<p>By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks 267 ;</p>
<p>For nature so prepost’rously 268 to err 269 —</p>
<p>Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense 270 —</p>
<p>Sans 271 witchcraft could not.</p>
<p>DUKE Whoe’er he be that in this foul proceeding 272</p>
<p>Hath thus beguiled 273 your daughter of herself,</p>
<p>And you of her, the bloody 274 book of law</p>
<p>You shall yourself read in the bitter letter</p>
<p>After your own sense 275 : yea, though our proper 276 son</p>
<p>Stood in your action 277 .</p>
<p>BRABANTIO Humbly I thank your grace.</p>
<p>Here is the man: this Moor, whom now it seems</p>
<p>Your special mandate for the state affairs</p>
<p>Hath hither brought.</p>
<p>ALL We are very sorry for’t.</p>
<p>DUKE What, in your own part, can you say to this?</p>
<p>To Othello</p>
<p>BRABANTIO Nothing, but 278 this is so.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Most potent, grave 279 and reverend signiors,</p>
<p>My very noble and approved 280 good masters:</p>
<p>That I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,</p>
<p>It is most true: true I have married her;</p>
<p>The very head and front 281 of my offending</p>
<p>Hath this extent, no more. Rude 282 am I in my speech,</p>
<p>And little blessed with the soft phrase of peace;</p>
<p>For since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith 283 284 ,</p>
<p>Till now some nine moons wasted 285 , they have used</p>
<p>Their dearest 286 action in the tented 287 field,</p>
<p>And little of this great world can I speak</p>
<p>More than pertains to feats of broils 288 and battle,</p>
<p>And therefore little shall I grace my cause</p>
<p>In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,</p>
<p>I will a round 289 unvarnished tale deliver</p>
<p>Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms,</p>
<p>What conjuration 290 and what mighty magic —</p>
<p>For such proceeding I am charged withal 291 —</p>
<p>I won his daughter.</p>
<p>BRABANTIO A maiden never bold,</p>
<p>Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion 292</p>
<p>Blushed at herself: and she, in spite of nature,</p>
<p>Of years 293 , of country, credit 294 , everything,</p>
<p>To fall in love with what she feared to look on!</p>
<p>It is a judgement maimed and most imperfect</p>
<p>That will confess perfection so could err</p>
<p>Against all rules of nature, and must be driven</p>
<p>To find out practices 295 of cunning hell</p>
<p>Why this should be. I therefore vouch 296 again</p>
<p>That with some mixtures 297 pow’rful o’er the blood,</p>
<p>Or with some dram 298 , conjured to this effect,</p>
<p>He wrought 299 upon her.</p>
<p>DUKE To vouch this is no proof,</p>
<p>Without more wider and more overt test 300</p>
<p>Than these thin habits 301 and poor likelihoods</p>
<p>Of modern seeming 302 do prefer 303 against him.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR But, Othello, speak:</p>
<p>Did you by indirect 304 and forcèd courses 305</p>
<p>Subdue and poison this young maid’s affections?</p>
<p>Or came it by request and such fair question 306</p>
<p>As soul to soul affordeth 307 ?</p>
<p>OTHELLO I do beseech you,</p>
<p>Send for the lady to the Sagittary</p>
<p>And let her speak of me before her father:</p>
<p>If you do find me foul in her report,</p>
<p>The trust, the office 308 I do hold of you</p>
<p>Not only take away, but let your sentence</p>
<p>Even fall upon my life.</p>
<p>DUKE Fetch Desdemona hither.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.—</p>
<p>[Exeunt Iago and Attendants ]</p>
<p>And, till she come, as truly as to heaven</p>
<p>I do confess the vices of my blood 309 ,</p>
<p>So justly 310 to your grave ears I’ll present 311</p>
<p>How I did thrive in this fair lady’s love,</p>
<p>And she in mine.</p>
<p>DUKE Say it, Othello.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Her father loved me, oft invited me,</p>
<p>Still 312 questioned me the story of my life</p>
<p>From year to year: the battle, sieges, fortune,</p>
<p>That I have passed 313 .</p>
<p>I ran it through, even from my boyish days</p>
<p>To th’very moment that he bade me tell it,</p>
<p>Wherein I spoke of most disastrous 314 chances,</p>
<p>Of moving 315 accidents 316 by flood and field 317 ,</p>
<p>Of hair-breadth scapes 318 i’th’imminent deadly breach 319 ,</p>
<p>Of being taken by the insolent 320 foe</p>
<p>And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,</p>
<p>And portance 321 in my traveller’s history,</p>
<p>Wherein of antres 322 vast and deserts idle 323 ,</p>
<p>Rough quarries, rocks, hills whose head touch heaven,</p>
<p>It was my hint 324 to speak: such was my process 325 .</p>
<p>And of the cannibals that each other eat,</p>
<p>The Anthropophagi 326 and men whose heads</p>
<p>Grew beneath their shoulders: these things to hear 327</p>
<p>Would Desdemona seriously 328 incline,</p>
<p>But still the house-affairs would draw her thence,</p>
<p>Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,</p>
<p>She’d come again, and with a greedy ear</p>
<p>Devour up my discourse: which I observing,</p>
<p>Took once a pliant 329 hour, and found good means</p>
<p>To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart</p>
<p>That I would all my pilgrimage 330 dilate 331 ,</p>
<p>Whereof by parcels 332 she had something heard,</p>
<p>But not intentively 333 . I did consent,</p>
<p>And often did beguile her o 334 f her tears,</p>
<p>When I did speak of some distressful stroke 335</p>
<p>That my youth suffered. My story being done,</p>
<p>She gave me for my pains a world of kisses 336 :</p>
<p>She swore, ‘In faith’ twas strange, ’twas passing 337 strange,</p>
<p>‘Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful!’</p>
<p>She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished</p>
<p>That heaven had made her 338 such a man. She thanked me,</p>
<p>And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,</p>
<p>I should but teach him how to tell my story,</p>
<p>And that would woo her. Upon this hint 339 I spake:</p>
<p>She loved me for the dangers I had passed,</p>
<p>And I loved her that she did pity them.</p>
<p>This only is the witchcraft I have used.</p>
<p>Here comes the lady: let her witness 340 it.</p>
<p>Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants</p>
<p>DUKE I think this tale would win my daughter too.</p>
<p>Good Brabantio,</p>
<p>Take up this mangled matter at the best 341 :</p>
<p>Men do their broken weapons rather use</p>
<p>Than their bare hands.</p>
<p>BRABANTIO I pray you hear her speak:</p>
<p>If she confess that she was half the wooer,</p>
<p>Destruction on my head if my bad 342 blame</p>
<p>Light on the man!— Come hither, gentle mistress.</p>
<p>To Desdemona</p>
<p>Do you perceive in all this noble company</p>
<p>Where most you owe obedience?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA My noble father,</p>
<p>I do perceive here a divided duty.</p>
<p>To you I am bound for life and education 343 :</p>
<p>My life and education both do learn 344 me</p>
<p>How to respect you. You are the lord of duty,</p>
<p>I am hitherto 345 your daughter. But here’s my husband,</p>
<p>And so much duty as my mother showed</p>
<p>To you, preferring 346 you before her father,</p>
<p>So much I challenge 347 that I may profess</p>
<p>Due to the Moor my lord.</p>
<p>BRABANTIO God be with you! I have done.</p>
<p>Please it 348 your grace, on to the state affairs.</p>
<p>I had rather to adopt a child than get 349 it.</p>
<p>Come hither, Moor:</p>
<p>I here do give thee that with all my heart</p>
<p>Which but 350 thou hast already, with all my heart</p>
<p>I would keep from thee.— For your sake 351 , jewel,</p>
<p>To Desdemona</p>
<p>I am glad at soul I have no other child,</p>
<p>For thy escape 352 would teach me tyranny,</p>
<p>To hang clogs 353 on them.— I have done, my lord.</p>
<p>To the Duke</p>
<p>DUKE Let me speak like yourself 354 , and lay 355 a sentence 356</p>
<p>Which, as a grise 357 or step, may help these lovers.</p>
<p>When remedies are past 358 , the griefs 359 are ended</p>
<p>By seeing the worst, which late 360 on hopes depended.</p>
<p>To mourn a mischief 361 that is past and gone</p>
<p>Is the next 362 way to draw new mischief on.</p>
<p>What cannot be preserved when fortune takes 363 ,</p>
<p>Patience her injury a mock’ry makes 364 .</p>
<p>The robbed that smiles steals something from the thief:</p>
<p>He robs himself that spends 365 a bootless 366 grief.</p>
<p>BRABANTIO So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile 367 ,</p>
<p>We lose it not, so long as we can smile.</p>
<p>He bears the sentence well that nothing bears</p>
<p>But the free 368 comfort which from thence he hears 369 :</p>
<p>But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow</p>
<p>That, to pay grief, must of poor 370 patience borrow 371 .</p>
<p>These sentences, to sugar or to gall,</p>
<p>Being strong on both sides, are equivocal 372 .</p>
<p>But words are words: I never yet did hear</p>
<p>That the bruisèd 373 heart was pierced 374 through the ears 375 .</p>
<p>I humbly beseech you proceed to th’affairs of state.</p>
<p>DUKE The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.
Othello, the fortitude 376 of the place is best known to you, and though
we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency 377 , yet opinion
378 , a more sovereign mistress of effects 379 , throws a more safer
voice on you 380 : you must therefore be content to slubber 381 the
gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn 382 and boisterous
383 expedition.</p>
<p>OTHELLO The tyrant custom, most grave senators,</p>
<p>Hath made the flinty 384 and steel couch 385 of war</p>
<p>My thrice-driven 386 bed of down 387 : I do agnize 388</p>
<p>A natural and prompt alacrity 389</p>
<p>I find in hardness 390 , and do undertake</p>
<p>This present wars against the Ottomites.</p>
<p>Most humbly therefore bending to your state 391 ,</p>
<p>I crave fit disposition 392 for my wife,</p>
<p>Due reference of place and exhibition 393 ,</p>
<p>With such accommodation 394 and besort 395</p>
<p>As levels with 396 her breeding.</p>
<p>DUKE Why, at her fathers.</p>
<p>BRABANTIO I will not have it so.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Nor I.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Nor would I there reside,</p>
<p>To put my father in impatient thoughts</p>
<p>By being in his eye 397 . Most gracious duke,</p>
<p>To my unfolding 398 lend your prosperous ear,</p>
<p>And let me find a charter 399 in your voice</p>
<p>T’assist my simpleness 400 .</p>
<p>DUKE What would you, Desdemona?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA That I love the Moor to live with him,</p>
<p>My downright violence 401 and storm of fortunes 402</p>
<p>May trumpet to the world. My heart’s subdued</p>
<p>Even to 403 the very quality 404 of my lord.</p>
<p>I saw Othello’s visage in his mind,</p>
<p>And to his honours and his valiant parts 405</p>
<p>Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate 406 :</p>
<p>So that, dear lords, if I be left behind</p>
<p>A moth 407 of peace, and he go to the war,</p>
<p>The rites 408 for why I love him are bereft me,</p>
<p>And I a heavy interim shall support</p>
<p>By his dear 409 absence. Let me go with him.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Let her have your voice 410 .</p>
<p>Vouch 411 with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not</p>
<p>To please the palate of my appetite,</p>
<p>Nor to comply with heat 412 — the young affects 413</p>
<p>In my defunct and proper satisfaction 414 —</p>
<p>But to be free 415 and bounteous to her mind:</p>
<p>And heaven 416 defend your good souls that 417 you think</p>
<p>I will your serious and great business scant 418</p>
<p>When she is with me. No, when light-winged toys 419</p>
<p>Of feathered 420 Cupid seel 421 with wanton dullness 422</p>
<p>My speculative and officed instrument 423 ,</p>
<p>That 424 my disports 425 corrupt and taint my business,</p>
<p>Let housewives make a skillet 426 of my helm 427 ,</p>
<p>And all indign 428 and base adversities</p>
<p>Make head 429 against my estimation 430 !</p>
<p>DUKE Be it as you shall privately determine,</p>
<p>Either for her stay or going: th’affair cries 431 haste,</p>
<p>And speed must answer it.</p>
<p>A SENATOR You must away tonight.</p>
<p>OTHELLO With all my heart.</p>
<p>DUKE At nine i’th’morning here we’ll meet again.</p>
<p>Othello, leave some officer behind,</p>
<p>And he shall our commission bring to you,</p>
<p>And such things else of quality and respect 432</p>
<p>As doth import 433 you.</p>
<p>OTHELLO So please your grace, my ancient:</p>
<p>A man he is of honesty and trust:</p>
<p>To his conveyance 434 I assign my wife,</p>
<p>With what else needful your good grace shall think</p>
<p>To be sent after me.</p>
<p>DUKE Let it be so.</p>
<p>Goodnight to everyone.— And, noble signior,</p>
<p>To Brabantio</p>
<p>If virtue no delighted 435 beauty lack,</p>
<p>Your son-in-law is far more fair 436 than black 437 .</p>
<p>A SENATOR Adieu, brave Moor: use Desdemona well.</p>
<p>BRABANTIO Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:</p>
<p>She has deceived her father, and may thee.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Duke, Senators and Officers ]</p>
<p>OTHELLO My life upon her faith! Honest 438 Iago,</p>
<p>My Desdemona must I leave to thee:</p>
<p>I prithee let thy wife attend on her,</p>
<p>And bring them after in the best advantage 439 .</p>
<p>Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour</p>
<p>Of love, of worldly matter and direction 440</p>
<p>To spend with thee: we must obey the time 441 .</p>
<p>Exeunt [Othello and Desdemona ]</p>
<p>RODORIGO Iago—</p>
<p>IAGO What say’st thou, noble heart 442 ?</p>
<p>RODORIGO What will I do, think’st thou?</p>
<p>IAGO Why, go to bed and sleep.</p>
<p>RODORIGO I will incontinently 443 drown myself.</p>
<p>IAGO If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly
gentleman?</p>
<p>RODORIGO It is silliness to live when to live is torment: and then
have we a prescription 444 to die when death is our physician.</p>
<p>IAGO O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven
years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I
never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere 445 I would say I
would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen 446 , I would change 447
my humanity with a baboon 448 .</p>
<p>RODORIGO What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond 449
, but it is not in my virtue 450 to amend it.</p>
<p>IAGO Virtue? A fig! 451 ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners: so
that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set 452 hyssop 453 and
weed up thyme, supply it with one gender 454 of herbs or distract 455 it
with many, either to have it sterile with idleness 456 or manured with
industry, why, the power and corrigible authority 457 of this lies in
our wills. If the beam 458 of our lives had not one scale of reason to
poise 459 another of sensuality, the blood 460 and baseness of our
natures would conduct us to most preposterous 461 conclusions 462 : but
we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings 463 , our
unbitted 464 lusts, whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect
or scion 465 .</p>
<p>RODORIGO It cannot be.</p>
<p>IAGO It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will
466 . Come, be a man. Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies. I
have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit 467 to thy deserving
with cables of perdurable 468 toughness: I could never better stead 469
thee than now. Put money in thy purse: follow thou the wars: defeat thy
favour with an usurped beard 470 : I say, put money in thy purse. It
cannot be long that Desdemona should continue her love to the Moor. Put
money in thy purse. Nor he his to her: it was a violent commencement in
her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration 471 . Put but money
in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse
with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts 472 shall
be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida 473 . She must change for
youth 474 : when she is sated with his body, she will find the errors of
her choice: therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn
thyself, do it a more delicate 475 way than drowning. Make 476 all the
money thou canst. If sanctimony 477 and a frail vow betwixt an erring
478 barbarian 479 and supersubtle 480 Venetian be not too hard for my
wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her. Therefore make
money. A pox 481 of 482 drowning thyself! It is clean out of the way 483
: seek thou rather to be hanged in 484 compassing 485 thy joy 486 than
to be drowned and go without her.</p>
<p>RODORIGO Wilt thou be fast 487 to my hopes if I depend on the issue
488 ?</p>
<p>IAGO Thou art 489 sure of me. Go, make money. I have told thee often,
and I re-tell thee again and again, I hate the Moor: my cause is hearted
490 ; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive 491 in our
revenge against him: if thou canst cuckoldhim, thou dost thyself a
pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which
will be delivered. Traverse 492 , go, provide thy money. We will have
more of this tomorrow. Adieu.</p>
<p>RODORIGO Where shall we meet i’th’morning?</p>
<p>IAGO At my lodging.</p>
<p>RODORIGO I’ll be with thee betimes 493 .</p>
<p>IAGO Go to 494 , farewell. Do you hear, Rodorigo?</p>
<p>As Rodorigo leaves</p>
<p>RODORIGO I’ll sell all my land.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>IAGO Thus do I ever make my fool my purse,</p>
<p>For I mine own gained knowledge should profane 495 ,</p>
<p>If I would time expend with such a snipe 496</p>
<p>But 497 for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:</p>
<p>And it is thought abroad 498 that ’twixt my sheets</p>
<p>He has done my office 499 : I know not if’t be true,</p>
<p>But I, for mere suspicion in that kind 500 ,</p>
<p>Will do as if for surety 501 . He holds me well 502 ,</p>
<p>The better shall my purpose work on him.</p>
<p>Cassio’s a proper 503 man. Let me see now:</p>
<p>To get his place and to plume up 504 my will</p>
<p>In double knavery. How, how? Let’s see:</p>
<p>After some time, to abuse Othello’s ears</p>
<p>That he 505 is too familiar with his wife.</p>
<p>He hath a person 506 and a smooth dispose 507</p>
<p>To be suspected, framed 508 to make women false 509 .</p>
<p>The Moor is of a free 510 and open nature,</p>
<p>That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,</p>
<p>And will as tenderly 511 be led by th’nose</p>
<p>As asses are.</p>
<p>I have’t: it is engend’red 512 : hell and night</p>
<p>Must bring this monstrous 513 birth to the world’s light.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
