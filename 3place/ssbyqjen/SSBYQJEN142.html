continues</h4>
<p>Enter Berowne, with a paper in his hand, alone</p>
<p>BEROWNE The king, he is hunting the deer: I am coursing 949 myself.
They have pitched a toil 950 : I am toiling in a pitch 951 , pitch that
defiles 952 . Defile, a foul word. Well, set thee down 953 , sorrow, for
so they say the fool said, and so say I 954 , and I the fool. Well
proved, wit! By the lord, this love is as mad as Ajax: it kills sheep
955 , it kills me — I a sheep. Well proved again o’my side. I will not
love; if I do, hang me. I’faith, I will not. O, but her eye, — by this
light, but for her eye, I would not love her — yes, for her two eyes.
Well, I do nothing in the world but lie, and lie in my throat 956 . By
heaven, I do love, and it hath taught me to rhyme and to be melancholy.
And here is part of my rhyme, and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one
o’my sonnets already. The clown bore it, the fool sent it, and the lady
hath it. Sweet clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would
not care a pin, if the other three were in 957 . Here comes one with a
paper. God give him grace to groan 958 !</p>
<p>He stands aside. The King entereth [with a paper ]</p>
<p>KING Ay me!</p>
<p>BEROWNE Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid, thou hast thumped him
with thy bird-bolt 959 under the left pap 960 961 . In faith,
secrets!</p>
<p>Speaks aside through</p>
<p>the rest of the scene</p>
<p>KING ’So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,</p>
<p>As thy eye-beams 962 , when their fresh rays have smote</p>
<p>The night of dew 963 that on my cheeks down flows.</p>
<p>Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright</p>
<p>Through the transparent bosom of the deep 964 ,</p>
<p>As doth thy face through tears of mine give light.</p>
<p>Thou shin’st in every tear that I do weep,</p>
<p>No drop but as a coach doth carry thee:</p>
<p>So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.</p>
<p>Do but behold the tears that swell in me,</p>
<p>And they thy glory through my grief will show.</p>
<p>But do not love thyself: then thou wilt keep</p>
<p>My tears for glasses 965 , and still 966 make me weep.</p>
<p>O queen of queens, how far dost thou excel,</p>
<p>No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.’</p>
<p>How shall she know my griefs? I’ll drop the paper.</p>
<p>Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?</p>
<p>Enter Longaville [with a paper ]</p>
<p>The King steps aside</p>
<p>What, Longaville, and reading? Listen, ear.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Now, in thy 967 likeness, one more fool appear!</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE Ay me, I am forsworn!</p>
<p>BEROWNE Why, he comes in like a perjure 968 , wearing papers 969
.</p>
<p>KING In love, I hope. Sweet fellowship in shame!</p>
<p>Speaks aside through the rest of the scene</p>
<p>BEROWNE One drunkard loves another of the name 970 .</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE Am I the first that have been perjured so?</p>
<p>BEROWNE I could put thee in comfort: not by two that I know.</p>
<p>Thou makest the triumviry 971 , the corner-cap 972 of society 973
,</p>
<p>The shape of Love’s Tyburn 974 that hangs up simplicity 975 .</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE I fear these stubborn 976 lines lack power to move 977
.</p>
<p>O sweet Maria, empress of my love,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>These numbers 978 will I tear and write in prose.</p>
<p>Tears paper</p>
<p>BEROWNE O, rhymes are guards 979 on wanton Cupid’s hose 980 :</p>
<p>Disfigure not his shop 981 .</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE This same shall go.</p>
<p>’Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,</p>
<p>He reads the sonnet</p>
<p>Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,</p>
<p>Persuade my heart to this false perjury?</p>
<p>Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.</p>
<p>A woman I forswore, but I will prove,</p>
<p>Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee.</p>
<p>My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love:</p>
<p>Thy grace 982 being gained cures all disgrace in me.</p>
<p>Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:</p>
<p>Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,</p>
<p>Exhal’st 983 this vapour-vow, in thee it is.</p>
<p>If broken then, it is no fault of mine:</p>
<p>If by me broke, what fool is not so wise</p>
<p>To 984 lose an oath to win a paradise?’</p>
<p>BEROWNE This is the liver vein 985 , which makes flesh a deity,</p>
<p>A green goose 986 a goddess. Pure, pure idolatry.</p>
<p>God amend us, God amend! We are much out o’th’way 987 .</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE By whom shall I send this? Company? Stay.</p>
<p>Enter Dumaine [with a paper ]</p>
<p>Longaville steps aside</p>
<p>BEROWNE All hid, all hid: an old infant play 988 .</p>
<p>Like a demigod here sit I in the sky,</p>
<p>And wretched fools’ secrets heedfully o’er-eye 989 .</p>
<p>More sacks to the mill 990 . O heavens, I have my wish!</p>
<p>Dumaine transformed! Four woodcocks 991 in a dish!</p>
<p>DUMAINE O most divine Kate!</p>
<p>BEROWNE O most profane coxcomb 992 !</p>
<p>DUMAINE By heaven, the wonder of a mortal eye!</p>
<p>BEROWNE By earth, she is not, corporal 993 : there you lie.</p>
<p>DUMAINE Her amber hairs for foul hath amber quoted 994 995 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE An amber-coloured raven was well noted 996 .</p>
<p>DUMAINE As upright as the cedar.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Stoop 997 , I say.</p>
<p>Her shoulder is with child 998 .</p>
<p>DUMAINE As fair as day.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Ay, as some days, but then no sun must shine.</p>
<p>DUMAINE O that I had my wish!</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE And I had mine!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>KING And I mine too, good lord!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>BEROWNE Amen, so I had mine! Is not that a good word 999 ?</p>
<p>DUMAINE I would forget her, but a 1000 fever she</p>
<p>Reigns in my blood and will remembered be.</p>
<p>BEROWNE A fever in your blood? Why then incision 1001</p>
<p>Would let her out in saucers 1002 . Sweet misprision 1003 !</p>
<p>DUMAINE Once more I’ll read the ode that I have writ.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Once more I’ll mark how love can vary wit 1004 .</p>
<p>DUMAINE ’On a day — alack the day! —</p>
<p>Reads his sonnet</p>
<p>Love, whose month is ever May,</p>
<p>Spied a blossom passing 1005 fair</p>
<p>Playing in the wanton 1006 air:</p>
<p>Through the velvet leaves the wind,</p>
<p>All unseen, can passage find.</p>
<p>That 1007 the lover, sick to death 1008 ,</p>
<p>Wish himself the heaven’s breath.</p>
<p>‘’Air’‘, quoth he,’’thy cheeks may blow,</p>
<p>Air, would I might triumph so!</p>
<p>But, alack, my hand is sworn</p>
<p>Ne’er to pluck thee from thy thorn.</p>
<p>Vow, alack, for youth unmeet 1009 ,</p>
<p>Youth so apt to pluck a sweet 1010 .</p>
<p>Do not call it sin in me,</p>
<p>That I am forsworn for thee:</p>
<p>Thou for whom Jove would swear</p>
<p>Juno 1011 but an Ethiope 1012 were,</p>
<p>And deny himself for 1013 Jove,</p>
<p>Turning mortal for thy love.’’ ’</p>
<p>This will I send, and something else more plain,</p>
<p>That shall express my true love’s fasting pain.</p>
<p>O, would the king, Berowne, and Longaville</p>
<p>Were lovers too! Ill, to example 1014 ill,</p>
<p>Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note 1015 ,</p>
<p>For none offend where all alike do dote 1016 .</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE Dumaine, thy love is far from charity 1017 ,</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>That 1018 in love’s grief desirest society 1019 .</p>
<p>You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,</p>
<p>To be o’erheard and taken napping 1020 so.</p>
<p>KING Come, sir, you blush: as his your case is such 1021 ,</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>You chide at him, offending twice as much.</p>
<p>You do not love Maria? Longaville</p>
<p>Did never sonnet for her sake compile,</p>
<p>Nor never lay his wreathèd 1022 arms athwart 1023</p>
<p>His loving bosom to keep down his heart?</p>
<p>I have been closely 1024 shrouded in this bush</p>
<p>And marked you both and for you both did blush.</p>
<p>I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion 1025 ,</p>
<p>Saw sighs reek 1026 from you, noted well your passion.</p>
<p>‘Ay me’, says one, ‘O Jove!’ the other cries,</p>
<p>One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other’s eyes:</p>
<p>You would for paradise break faith and troth 1027 ,</p>
<p>To Longaville</p>
<p>And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.</p>
<p>To Dumaine</p>
<p>What will Berowne say when that he shall hear</p>
<p>Faith infringèd which such zeal did swear?</p>
<p>How will he scorn? How will he spend 1028 his wit?</p>
<p>How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!</p>
<p>For all the wealth that ever I did see,</p>
<p>I would not have him know so much by 1029 me.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>Ah, good my liege, I pray thee pardon me.</p>
<p>Good heart, what grace 1030 hast thou, thus to reprove</p>
<p>These worms 1031 for loving, that art most in love?</p>
<p>Your eyes do make no coaches 1032 . In your tears</p>
<p>There is no certain princess that appears.</p>
<p>You’ll not be perjured, ’tis a hateful thing,</p>
<p>Tush, none but minstrels 1033 like of sonneting 1034 .</p>
<p>But are you not ashamed? Nay, are you not,</p>
<p>All three of you, to be thus much o’ershot 1035 ?</p>
<p>You found his mote 1036 , the king your mote did see,</p>
<p>To Longaville</p>
<p>But I a beam 1037 do find in each of three.</p>
<p>O, what a scene of fool’ry have I seen,</p>
<p>Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen 1038 !</p>
<p>O me, with what strict patience have I sat,</p>
<p>To see a king transformèd to a gnat 1039 !</p>
<p>To see great Hercules whipping a gig 1040 ,</p>
<p>And profound 1041 Solomon tuning a jig 1042 ,</p>
<p>And Nestor 1043 play at push-pin 1044 with the boys,</p>
<p>And critic Timon 1045 laugh at idle toys 1046 .</p>
<p>Where lies thy grief? O, tell me, good Dumaine;</p>
<p>And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?</p>
<p>And where my liege’s? All about the breast?</p>
<p>A caudle 1047 , ho!</p>
<p>KING Too bitter is thy jest.</p>
<p>Are we betrayed thus to thy over-view 1048 ?</p>
<p>BEROWNE Not you to me, but I betrayed by you:</p>
<p>I, that am honest 1049 , I, that hold it sin</p>
<p>To break the vow I am engagèd in,</p>
<p>I am betrayed by keeping company</p>
<p>With men like you, men of inconstancy.</p>
<p>When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?</p>
<p>Or groan for Joan? Or spend a minute’s time</p>
<p>In pruning me 1050 ? When shall you hear that I</p>
<p>Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,</p>
<p>A gait, a state 1051 , a brow, a breast, a waist,</p>
<p>A leg, a limb—</p>
<p>Starts to leave</p>
<p>KING Soft! 1052 Whither away so fast?</p>
<p>A true 1053 man or a thief that gallops so?</p>
<p>BEROWNE I post 1054 from love. Good lover, let me go.</p>
<p>Enter Jaquenetta [with a letter ] and Clown [Costard ]</p>
<p>JAQUENETTA God bless the king!</p>
<p>KING What present 1055 hast thou there?</p>
<p>COSTARD Some certain treason.</p>
<p>KING What makes treason 1056 here?</p>
<p>COSTARD Nay, it makes nothing, sir.</p>
<p>KING If it mar 1057 nothing neither,</p>
<p>The treason and you go in peace away together.</p>
<p>JAQUENETTA I beseech your grace, let this letter be read.</p>
<p>Gives letter to the King</p>
<p>Our person 1058 misdoubts 1059 it: ’twas treason, he said.</p>
<p>KING Berowne, read it over—</p>
<p>Gives the letter to Berowne</p>
<p>Where hadst thou it?</p>
<p>To Jaquenetta</p>
<p>JAQUENETTA Of Costard.</p>
<p>[Berowne ] reads the letter</p>
<p>KING Where hadst thou it?</p>
<p>COSTARD Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.</p>
<p>Berowne tears the letter</p>
<p>KING How now? What is in you? Why dost thou tear it?</p>
<p>BEROWNE A toy 1060 , my liege, a toy. Your grace needs not fear
it.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE It did move him to passion 1061 , and therefore let’s hear
it.</p>
<p>DUMAINE It is Berowne’s writing and here is his name.</p>
<p>Gathers the pieces and reads them</p>
<p>BEROWNE Ah, you whoreson 1062 loggerhead 1063 ! You were born to do
me shame.— Guilty, my lord, guilty. I confess, I confess.</p>
<p>To Costard</p>
<p>KING What?</p>
<p>BEROWNE That you three fools lacked me fool to make up the mess 1064
:</p>
<p>He, he, and you — and you, my liege — and I,</p>
<p>Are pick-purses 1065 in love, and we deserve to die.</p>
<p>O, dismiss this audience and I shall tell you more.</p>
<p>DUMAINE Now the number is even.</p>
<p>BEROWNE True, true: we are four.</p>
<p>Will these turtles 1066 be gone?</p>
<p>KING Hence, sirs 1067 , away!</p>
<p>To Costard and Jaquenetta</p>
<p>COSTARD Walk aside the true folk 1068 and let the traitors stay.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Costard and Jaquenetta ]</p>
<p>BEROWNE Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!</p>
<p>As true we are as flesh and blood can be,</p>
<p>The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face:</p>
<p>Young blood doth not obey an old decree.</p>
<p>We cannot cross 1069 the cause why we are born 1070 :</p>
<p>Therefore of all hands 1071 must we be forsworn.</p>
<p>KING What, did these rent 1072 lines show some love of thine?</p>
<p>BEROWNE ‘Did they’, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,</p>
<p>That, like a rude 1073 and savage 1074 man of Ind 1075 ,</p>
<p>At the first opening 1076 of the gorgeous east,</p>
<p>Bows not his vassal 1077 head, and strucken blind,</p>
<p>Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?</p>
<p>What peremptory 1078 eagle-sighted 1079 eye</p>
<p>Dares look upon the heaven of her brow</p>
<p>That is not blinded by her majesty?</p>
<p>KING What zeal, what fury 1080 hath inspired thee now?</p>
<p>My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon,</p>
<p>She 1081 , an attending 1082 star, scarce seen a light 1083 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Berowne.</p>
<p>O, but 1084 for my love 1085 , day would turn to night!</p>
<p>Of all complexions the culled sovereignty 1086</p>
<p>Do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek,</p>
<p>Where several worthies 1087 make one dignity 1088 ,</p>
<p>Where nothing wants 1089 that want 1090 itself doth seek.</p>
<p>Lend me the flourish of all gentle 1091 tongues —</p>
<p>Fie 1092 , painted 1093 rhetoric! O, she needs it not,</p>
<p>To things of 1094 sale a seller’s praise belongs:</p>
<p>She passes 1095 praise, then praise too short doth blot 1096 .</p>
<p>A withered hermit, fivescore winters worn 1097 ,</p>
<p>Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye.</p>
<p>Beauty doth varnish 1098 age as if new-born,</p>
<p>And gives the crutch 1099 the cradle’s infancy 1100 .</p>
<p>O, ’tis the sun that maketh all things shine.</p>
<p>KING By heaven, thy love is black as ebony 1101 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE Is ebony like her? O word divine!</p>
<p>A wife of such wood were felicity 1102 .</p>
<p>O, who can give an oath? Where is a book 1103 ?</p>
<p>That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack</p>
<p>If that she learn not of her eye to look 1104 .</p>
<p>No face is fair 1105 that is not full so black 1106 .</p>
<p>KING O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,</p>
<p>The hue 1107 of dungeons and the school 1108 of night,</p>
<p>And beauty’s crest 1109 becomes 1110 the heavens well.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light 1111 .</p>
<p>O, if in black my lady’s brows be decked,</p>
<p>It 1112 mourns that 1113 painting and usurping hair 1114</p>
<p>Should ravish doters 1115 with a false aspect 1116 ,</p>
<p>And therefore is she born to make black fair.</p>
<p>Her favour turns the fashion of the days 1117 ,</p>
<p>For native blood 1118 is counted painting 1119 now,</p>
<p>And therefore red 1120 that would avoid dispraise 1121</p>
<p>Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.</p>
<p>DUMAINE To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE And since her time are colliers 1122 counted bright.</p>
<p>KING And Ethiops of their sweet complexion crack 1123 .</p>
<p>DUMAINE Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Your mistresses dare never come in 1124 rain,</p>
<p>For fear their colours 1125 should be washed away.</p>
<p>KING ’Twere good, yours did, for, sir, to tell you plain,</p>
<p>I’ll find a fairer face not washed today.</p>
<p>BEROWNE I’ll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.</p>
<p>KING No devil will fright thee then 1126 so much as she.</p>
<p>DUMAINE I never knew man hold vile 1127 stuff so dear.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE Look, here’s 1128 thy love: my foot and her face see.</p>
<p>Shows his shoe</p>
<p>BEROWNE O, if the streets were pavèd with thine eyes,</p>
<p>Her feet were much too dainty 1129 for such tread.</p>
<p>DUMAINE O, vile! Then, as she goes 1130 , what upward lies 1131</p>
<p>The street should see as she walked overhead.</p>
<p>KING But what of this? Are we not all in love?</p>
<p>BEROWNE O, nothing so sure, and thereby all forsworn.</p>
<p>KING Then leave this chat, and good Berowne, now prove 1132</p>
<p>Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.</p>
<p>DUMAINE Ay, marry, there 1133 , some flattery for this evil 1134
.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE O, some authority how to proceed.</p>
<p>Some tricks, some quillets 1135 , how to cheat the devil.</p>
<p>DUMAINE Some salve 1136 for perjury.</p>
<p>BEROWNE O, ’tis more than need 1137 .</p>
<p>Have at you 1138 then, affection’s men at arms 1139 .</p>
<p>Consider what you first did swear unto:</p>
<p>To fast, to study, and to see no woman —</p>
<p>Flat treason against the kingly state 1140 of youth.</p>
<p>Say, can you fast? Your stomachs are too young,</p>
<p>And abstinence engenders maladies.</p>
<p>// And where 1141 that you have vowed to study, lords, //</p>
<p>// In that each of you have forsworn his book. //</p>
<p>// Can you still dream and pore and thereon look? //</p>
<p>// For when would you, my lord, or you, or you, //</p>
<p>// Have found the ground of study’s excellence //</p>
<p>// Without the beauty of a woman’s face? //</p>
<p>// From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive: //</p>
<p>// They are the ground, the books, the academes //</p>
<p>// From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire 1142 . //</p>
<p>// Why, universal plodding poisons up //</p>
<p>// The nimble spirits in the arteries, //</p>
<p>// As motion and long-during action tires //</p>
<p>// The sinewy vigour of the traveller. //</p>
<p>// Now, for not looking on a woman’s face, //</p>
<p>// You have in that forsworn the use of eyes //</p>
<p>// And study too, the causer of your vow, //</p>
<p>// For where is any author in the world //</p>
<p>// Teaches such beauty as a woman’s eye? //</p>
<p>// Learning is but an adjunct to ourself //</p>
<p>// And where we are our learning likewise is. //</p>
<p>// Then when ourselves we see in ladies’ eyes, //</p>
<p>// With ourselves, //</p>
<p>// Do we not likewise see our learning there? //</p>
<p>O, we have made a vow to study, lords,</p>
<p>And in that vow we have forsworn our books,</p>
<p>For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,</p>
<p>In leaden contemplation have found out</p>
<p>Such fiery numbers 1143 as the prompting eyes</p>
<p>Of beauty’s tutors have enriched you with?</p>
<p>Other slow arts 1144 entirely keep 1145 the brain,</p>
<p>And therefore, finding barren 1146 practisers,</p>
<p>Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil.</p>
<p>But love, first learnèd in a lady’s eyes,</p>
<p>Lives not alone immurèd 1147 in the brain</p>
<p>But with the motion of all elements</p>
<p>Courses 1148 as swift as thought in every power 1149</p>
<p>And gives to every power a double power,</p>
<p>Above their functions and their offices 1150 .</p>
<p>It adds a precious seeing to the eye:</p>
<p>A lover’s eyes will gaze an eagle blind.</p>
<p>A lover’s ear will hear the lowest sound,</p>
<p>When the suspicious head of theft is stopped 1151 .</p>
<p>Love’s feeling is more soft and sensible 1152</p>
<p>Than are the tender horns of cockled 1153 snails.</p>
<p>Love’s tongue proves dainty Bacchus 1154 gross 1155 in taste.</p>
<p>For 1156 valour, is not Love a Hercules,</p>
<p>Still climbing trees in the Hesperides 1157 ?</p>
<p>Subtle 1158 as Sphinx 1159 , as sweet and musical</p>
<p>As bright Apollo 1160 ’s lute, strung with his hair.</p>
<p>And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods</p>
<p>Make heaven drowsy with the harmony.</p>
<p>Never durst 1161 poet touch a pen to write</p>
<p>Until his ink were tempered 1162 with love’s sighs.</p>
<p>O, then his lines would ravish savage ears</p>
<p>And plant in tyrants mild humility.</p>
<p>From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive:</p>
<p>They sparkle still the right Promethean fire 1163 ,</p>
<p>They are the books, the arts, the academes 1164 ,</p>
<p>That show, contain and nourish all the world,</p>
<p>Else 1165 none at all in aught 1166 proves excellent.</p>
<p>Then fools you were these women to forswear,</p>
<p>Or, keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.</p>
<p>For wisdom’s sake, a word that all men love,</p>
<p>Or, for love’s sake, a word that loves 1167 all men,</p>
<p>Or, for men’s sake, the authors 1168 of these women,</p>
<p>Or, women’s sake, by whom 1169 we men are men,</p>
<p>Let’s once 1170 lose our oaths to find ourselves,</p>
<p>Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.</p>
<p>It is religion 1171 to be thus forsworn,</p>
<p>For charity itself fulfils the law 1172 ,</p>
<p>And who can sever love from charity?</p>
<p>KING Saint Cupid, then! And, soldiers, to the field!</p>
<p>BEROWNE Advance your standards 1173 , and upon them 1174 , lords.</p>
<p>Pell-mell 1175 , down with them! But be first advised 1176</p>
<p>In conflict that you get the sun of them 1177 .</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE Now to plain dealing 1178 : lay these glozes 1179 by.</p>
<p>Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?</p>
<p>KING And win them too: therefore let us devise</p>
<p>Some entertainment for them in their tents.</p>
<p>BEROWNE First, from the park let us conduct them thither.</p>
<p>Then homeward every man attach 1180 the hand</p>
<p>Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon</p>
<p>We will with some strange 1181 pastime solace 1182 them,</p>
<p>Such as the shortness of the time can shape,</p>
<p>For revels, dances, masks and merry hours</p>
<p>Forerun 1183 fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.</p>
<p>KING Away, away! No time shall be omitted</p>
<p>That will betime 1184 , and may by us be fitted 1185 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE Allons ! 1186 Allons ! Sowed cockle reaped no corn 1187 ,</p>
<p>And justice always whirls in equal measure 1188 :</p>
<p>Light 1189 wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn,</p>
<p>If so, our copper 1190 buys no better treasure 1191 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
