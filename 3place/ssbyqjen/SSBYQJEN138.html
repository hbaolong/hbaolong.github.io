<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-2">Scene 1 / running scene 2</h4>
<p>Enter the Princess of France 349 with three attending Ladies
[Rosaline, Maria and Katherine ] and three Lords [Boyet and two others
]</p>
<p>BOYET Now, madam, summon up your dearest 350 spirits 351 .</p>
<p>Consider who the king your father sends,</p>
<p>To whom he sends, and what’s his embassy 352 :</p>
<p>Yourself, held precious in the world’s esteem,</p>
<p>To parley 353 with the sole inheritor 354</p>
<p>Of all perfections that a man may owe 355 ,</p>
<p>Matchless 356 Navarre, the plea 357 of no less weight</p>
<p>Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.</p>
<p>Be now as prodigal of 358 all dear 359 grace</p>
<p>As Nature was in making graces dear 360</p>
<p>When she did starve 361 the general world beside 362</p>
<p>And prodigally gave them all to you.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean 363 ,</p>
<p>Needs not the painted flourish of your praise.</p>
<p>Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,</p>
<p>Not uttered 364 by base sale of chapmen’s 365 tongues:</p>
<p>I am less proud to hear you tell 366 my worth</p>
<p>Than you much 367 willing to be counted 368 wise</p>
<p>In spending 369 your wit in the praise of mine.</p>
<p>But now to task 370 the tasker 371 . Good Boyet,</p>
<p>You are not ignorant 372 all-telling fame 373</p>
<p>Doth noise abroad 374 Navarre hath made a vow,</p>
<p>Till painful 375 study shall outwear three years,</p>
<p>No woman may approach his silent court:</p>
<p>Therefore to’s seemeth it 376 a needful 377 course,</p>
<p>Before we enter his forbidden gates,</p>
<p>To know his pleasure 378 , and in that behalf 379 ,</p>
<p>Bold 380 of your worthiness, we single 381 you</p>
<p>As our best-moving 382 fair 383 solicitor 384 .</p>
<p>Tell him the daughter of the King of France,</p>
<p>On serious business craving quick dispatch,</p>
<p>Importunes 385 personal conference 386 with his grace.</p>
<p>Haste, signify so much, while we attend 387 ,</p>
<p>Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.</p>
<p>BOYET Proud of 388 employment, willingly 389 I go.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>PRINCESS All pride 390 is willing pride, and yours is so.</p>
<p>Who are the votaries 391 , my loving lords,</p>
<p>That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?</p>
<p>A LORD Longaville is one.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Know you the man?</p>
<p>MARIA I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast</p>
<p>Between Lord Perigort 392 and the beauteous heir 393</p>
<p>Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized</p>
<p>In Normandy 394 , saw I this Longaville.</p>
<p>A man of sovereign parts 395 he is esteemed,</p>
<p>Well fitted 396 in arts 397 , glorious in arms 398 .</p>
<p>Nothing becomes him ill that he would well 399 .</p>
<p>The only soil 400 of his fair virtue’s gloss 401 ,</p>
<p>If virtue’s gloss will 402 stain with any soil,</p>
<p>Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will,</p>
<p>Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still 403 wills</p>
<p>It should none spare that come within his 404 power.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Some merry mocking lord, belike 405 : is’t so?</p>
<p>MARIA They say so most that most his humours 406 know.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.</p>
<p>Who are the rest?</p>
<p>KATHERINE The young Dumaine, a well-accomplished youth,</p>
<p>Of 407 all that virtue 408 love for virtue loved:</p>
<p>Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill 409 ,</p>
<p>For he hath wit to make an ill shape good 410 ,</p>
<p>And shape 411 to win grace though 412 he had no wit.</p>
<p>I saw him at the Duke Alençon 413 ’s once,</p>
<p>And much too little of that good I saw</p>
<p>Is my report to his great worthiness 414 .</p>
<p>ROSALINE Another of these students at that time</p>
<p>Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.</p>
<p>Berowne they call him, but a merrier man,</p>
<p>Within the limit of becoming 415 mirth,</p>
<p>I never spent an hour’s talk withal 416 .</p>
<p>His eye begets 417 occasion 418 for his wit,</p>
<p>For every object that the one doth catch 419 ,</p>
<p>The other turns to a mirth-moving 420 jest,</p>
<p>Which his fair tongue, conceit’s expositor 421 ,</p>
<p>Delivers in such apt and gracious words</p>
<p>That agèd ears play truant at 422 his tales</p>
<p>And younger hearings are quite ravishèd,</p>
<p>So sweet and voluble 423 is his discourse.</p>
<p>PRINCESS God bless my ladies! Are they all in love,</p>
<p>That every one her own hath garnishèd</p>
<p>With such bedecking 424 ornaments of praise?</p>
<p>MARIA Here comes Boyet.</p>
<p>Enter Boyet</p>
<p>PRINCESS Now, what admittance 425 , lord?</p>
<p>BOYET Navarre had notice of your fair approach,</p>
<p>And he and his competitors 426 in oath</p>
<p>Were all addressed 427 to meet you, gentle lady,</p>
<p>Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learned:</p>
<p>He rather means to lodge 428 you in the field 429 ,</p>
<p>Like one that comes here to besiege his court,</p>
<p>Than seek a dispensation for his oath</p>
<p>To let you enter his unpeopled 430 house.</p>
<p>Here comes Navarre.</p>
<p>Enter [the King of ] Navarre, Longaville, Dumaine, Berowne [and
Attendants ]</p>
<p>KING Fair princess, welcome to the court 431 of Navarre.</p>
<p>PRINCESS ‘Fair’ I give you back again, and ‘welcome’ I have not yet:
the roof of this court is too high to be yours, and welcome to the wide
fields too base to be mine.</p>
<p>KING You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.</p>
<p>PRINCESS I will be welcome, then. Conduct me thither.</p>
<p>KING Hear me, dear lady: I have sworn an oath.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Our Lady help my lord! He’ll be forsworn.</p>
<p>KING Not for the world, fair madam, by my will 432 .</p>
<p>PRINCESS Why, will 433 shall break it: will, and nothing else.</p>
<p>KING Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,</p>
<p>Where 434 now his knowledge must prove ignorance.</p>
<p>I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping 435 .</p>
<p>’Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,</p>
<p>And sin to break it.</p>
<p>But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:</p>
<p>To teach a teacher ill beseemeth 436 me.</p>
<p>Vouchsafe 437 to read the purpose of my coming,</p>
<p>Gives a paper</p>
<p>And suddenly 438 resolve me in my suit 439 .</p>
<p>KING Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>PRINCESS You will the sooner that I were away 440 ,</p>
<p>For you’ll prove perjured if you make me stay.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Did not I dance with you in Brabant 441 once?</p>
<p>To Rosaline</p>
<p>ROSALINE Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?</p>
<p>BEROWNE I know you did.</p>
<p>ROSALINE How needless was it then to ask the question!</p>
<p>BEROWNE You must not be so quick 442 .</p>
<p>ROSALINE ’Tis long 443 of you that spur me with such questions.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Your wit’s too hot 444 , it speeds too fast, ’twill tire.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Not till it leave the rider in the mire 445 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE What time o’day 446 ?</p>
<p>ROSALINE The hour that fools should ask.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Now fair befall your mask 447 .</p>
<p>ROSALINE Fair fall 448 the face it covers.</p>
<p>BEROWNE And send you many lovers.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Amen, so 449 you be none.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Nay, then will I be gone.</p>
<p>Walks away</p>
<p>To the Pringcess</p>
<p>KING Madam, your father here doth intimate 450</p>
<p>The payment of a hundred thousand crowns,</p>
<p>Being but th’one half of an entire sum</p>
<p>Disbursèd 451 by my father in his 452 wars.</p>
<p>But say that he 453 or we, as neither have 454 ,</p>
<p>Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid</p>
<p>A hundred thousand more, in surety 455 of the which,</p>
<p>One part of Aquitaine is bound 456 to us,</p>
<p>Although not valued to 457 the money’s worth.</p>
<p>If then the king your father will restore 458</p>
<p>But that one half which is unsatisfied 459 ,</p>
<p>We will give up our right in Aquitaine</p>
<p>And hold fair friendship with his majesty.</p>
<p>But that, it seems, he little purposeth 460 ,</p>
<p>For here he doth demand to have repaid 461</p>
<p>An hundred thousand crowns 462 , and not demands,</p>
<p>On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,</p>
<p>To have his title live in 463 Aquitaine,</p>
<p>Which we much rather had depart withal 464 ,</p>
<p>And have the money by our father lent,</p>
<p>Than Aquitaine, so gelded 465 as it is.</p>
<p>Dear princess, were not his requests so far</p>
<p>From reason’s yielding, your fair self should make</p>
<p>A yielding gainst some reason 466 in my breast</p>
<p>And go well satisfied to France again.</p>
<p>PRINCESS You do the king my father too much wrong</p>
<p>And wrong the reputation of your name,</p>
<p>In so unseeming 467 to confess receipt</p>
<p>Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.</p>
<p>KING I do protest I never heard of it.</p>
<p>And if you prove it, I’ll repay it back</p>
<p>Or yield up Aquitaine.</p>
<p>PRINCESS We arrest 468 your word 469 .</p>
<p>Boyet, you can produce acquittances 470</p>
<p>For such a sum from special officers</p>
<p>Of Charles, his 471 father.</p>
<p>KING Satisfy me so 472 .</p>
<p>BOYET So please your grace, the packet is not come</p>
<p>Where that and other specialties 473 are bound.</p>
<p>Tomorrow you shall have a sight of them.</p>
<p>KING It shall suffice me; at which interview,</p>
<p>All liberal reason 474 would I yield unto.</p>
<p>Meantime receive such welcome at my hand</p>
<p>As honour without breach of honour 475 may</p>
<p>Make tender of 476 to thy true worthiness.</p>
<p>You may not come, fair princess, in my gates,</p>
<p>But here without 477 you shall be so received</p>
<p>As 478 you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,</p>
<p>Though so denied fair harbour in my house.</p>
<p>Your 479 own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:</p>
<p>Tomorrow we shall visit you again.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Sweet health and fair desires consort 480 your grace.</p>
<p>KING Thy own wish wish I thee in every place! 481</p>
<p>Exit [the King, with Longaville and Dumaine ]</p>
<p>BEROWNE Lady, I will commend you to my own heart.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Pray you, do my commendations 482 , I would be glad to see
it.</p>
<p>BEROWNE I would you heard it groan.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Is the fool 483 sick?</p>
<p>BEROWNE Sick at the heart.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Alack, let it blood 484 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE Would that do it good?</p>
<p>ROSALINE My physic 485 says ‘ay’.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Will you prick’t with your eye 486 ?</p>
<p>ROSALINE Non point 487 , with my knife.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Now, God save thy life!</p>
<p>ROSALINE And yours from long living!</p>
<p>BEROWNE I cannot stay thanksgiving 488 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Dumaine</p>
<p>DUMAINE Sir, I pray you a word: what lady is that same?</p>
<p>To Boyet</p>
<p>BOYET The heir of Alençon, Katherine 489 her name.</p>
<p>DUMAINE A gallant 490 lady. Monsieur, fare you well.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>[Enter Longaville ]</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?</p>
<p>To Boyet</p>
<p>BOYET A woman sometimes, if you saw her in the light.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE Perchance light in the light 491 . I desire her name.</p>
<p>BOYET She hath but one for herself, to desire 492 that were a
shame.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE Pray you, sir, whose daughter?</p>
<p>BOYET Her mother’s, I have heard.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE God’s blessing o’your beard!</p>
<p>BOYET Good sir, be not offended.</p>
<p>She is an heir of Falconbridge.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE Nay, my choler 493 is ended.</p>
<p>She is a most sweet lady.</p>
<p>Exit Longaville</p>
<p>BOYET Not unlike 494 , sir, that may be.</p>
<p>Enter Berowne</p>
<p>BEROWNE What’s her name in the cap?</p>
<p>BOYET Rosaline 495 , by good hap 496 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE Is she wedded or no?</p>
<p>BOYET To her will, sir, or so 497 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE You are welcome, sir. Adieu.</p>
<p>BOYET Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you 498 .</p>
<p>Exit [Berowne ]</p>
<p>MARIA That last is Berowne, the merry madcap lord.</p>
<p>Not a word 499 with him but a jest.</p>
<p>BOYET And every jest but a word.</p>
<p>PRINCESS It was well done of you to take him at his word.</p>
<p>BOYET I was as willing to grapple 500 as he was to board 501 .</p>
<p>MARIA Two hot 502 sheeps 503 , marry.</p>
<p>BOYET And wherefore not ‘ships’?</p>
<p>No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.</p>
<p>MARIA You sheep, and I pasture 504 . Shall that finish the jest?</p>
<p>BOYET So 505 you grant pasture for me.</p>
<p>Tries to kiss her</p>
<p>MARIA Not so, gentle beast.</p>
<p>My lips are no common 506 , though several 507 they be.</p>
<p>BOYET Belonging to whom?</p>
<p>MARIA To my fortunes and me.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Good wits will be jangling 508 ; but, gentles 509 ,
agree.</p>
<p>This civil 510 war of wits were much better used</p>
<p>On Navarre and his bookmen 511 , for here ’tis abused 512 .</p>
<p>BOYET If my observation — which very seldom lies</p>
<p>By 513 the heart’s still 514 rhetoric disclosèd with eyes —</p>
<p>Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.</p>
<p>PRINCESS With what?</p>
<p>BOYET With that which we lovers entitle affected 515 .</p>
<p>PRINCESS Your reason?</p>
<p>BOYET Why, all his behaviours did make their retire 516</p>
<p>To the court 517 of his eye, peeping thorough 518 desire.</p>
<p>His heart, like an agate 519 , with your print 520 impressed 521
,</p>
<p>Proud 522 with his form 523 , in his eye pride expressed.</p>
<p>His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see 524 ,</p>
<p>Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be.</p>
<p>All senses to that sense 525 did make their repair 526 ,</p>
<p>To feel only looking on fairest of fair.</p>
<p>Methought all his senses were locked in his eye,</p>
<p>As jewels in crystal 527 for some prince to buy,</p>
<p>Who, tend’ring 528 their own worth from whence they were glassed 529
,</p>
<p>Did point 530 out to buy them along as you passed.</p>
<p>His face’s own margin 531 did quote 532 such amazes</p>
<p>That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.</p>
<p>I’ll give you Aquitaine, and all that is his,</p>
<p>An 533 you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Come to our pavilion 534 . Boyet is disposed 535 .</p>
<p>BOYET But 536 to speak that in words which his eye hath
disclosed.</p>
<p>I only have made a mouth of his eye,</p>
<p>By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.</p>
<p>MARIA He is Cupid’s grandfather and learns news of him.</p>
