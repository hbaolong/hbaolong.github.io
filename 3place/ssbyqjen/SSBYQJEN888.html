<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-1-24">Scene 1 ／ running scene 1 24</h4>
<p>Enter the Duke of Norfolk at one door. At the other, the Duke of
Buckingham and the Lord Abergavenny</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done</p>
<p>Since last we saw 25 in France?</p>
<p>NORFOLK I thank your grace:</p>
<p>Healthful, and ever since a fresh 26 admirer</p>
<p>Of what I saw there 27 .</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM An untimely ague 28</p>
<p>Stayed 29 me a prisoner in my chamber when</p>
<p>Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,</p>
<p>Met in the vale of Andres.</p>
<p>NORFOLK ’Twixt 30 Guînes and Ardres 31 :</p>
<p>I was then present, saw them salute on horseback,</p>
<p>Beheld them when they lighted 32 , how they clung</p>
<p>In their embracement as 33 they grew together,</p>
<p>Which had they 34 , what four throned ones 35 could have weighed
36</p>
<p>Such a compounded one?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM All the whole time</p>
<p>I was my chamber’s prisoner.</p>
<p>NORFOLK Then you lost</p>
<p>The view of earthly glory: men might say</p>
<p>Till this time pomp 37 was single, but now married</p>
<p>To one above itself. Each following day</p>
<p>Became the next day’s master 38 , till the last</p>
<p>Made former wonders its 39 . Today the French,</p>
<p>All clinquant 40 , all in gold, like heathen gods</p>
<p>Shone down 41 the English; and tomorrow 42 they 43</p>
<p>Made Britain India 44 : every man that stood</p>
<p>Showed 45 like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were</p>
<p>As cherubins 46 , all gilt: the madams 47 too,</p>
<p>Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear</p>
<p>The pride 48 upon them, that 49 their very labour</p>
<p>Was to them as a painting 50 . Now this masque 51</p>
<p>Was cried 52 incomparable, and th’ensuing night 53</p>
<p>Made it a fool and beggar 54 . The two kings,</p>
<p>Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,</p>
<p>As presence did present them 55 : him in eye,</p>
<p>Still him in praise 56 , and being present both,</p>
<p>’Twas said they saw but one 57 , and no discerner 58</p>
<p>Durst 59 wag his tongue in censure 60 . When these suns —</p>
<p>For so they phrase 61 ’em — by their heralds challenged</p>
<p>The noble spirits to arms, they did perform</p>
<p>Beyond thought’s compass 62 , that former fabulous story,</p>
<p>Being now seen possible enough, got credit 63 ,</p>
<p>That Bevis 64 was believed.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM O, you go far 65 .</p>
<p>NORFOLK As I belong to worship 66 , and affect</p>
<p>In honour honesty 67 , the tract 68 of ev’rything</p>
<p>Would by a good discourser 69 lose some life,</p>
<p>Which action’s self was to 70 ngue to. All was royal:</p>
<p>To the disposing of it nought rebelled 71 :</p>
<p>Order gave each thing view 72 . The office did</p>
<p>Distinctly his full function 73 .</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Who did guide —</p>
<p>I mean, who set the body and the limbs</p>
<p>Of this great sport 74 together, as you guess?</p>
<p>NORFOLK One, certes 75 , that promises no element 76</p>
<p>In such a business.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM I pray you who, my lord?</p>
<p>NORFOLK All this was ordered 77 by the good discretion 78</p>
<p>Of the right reverend Cardinal of York 79 .</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM The devil speed 80 him! No man’s pie is freed</p>
<p>From his ambitious finger. What had he</p>
<p>To do in these fierce 81 vanities 82 ? I wonder</p>
<p>That such a keech 83 can with his very bulk</p>
<p>Take up 84 the rays o’th’beneficial 85 sun 86</p>
<p>And keep it from the earth.</p>
<p>NORFOLK Surely, sir,</p>
<p>There’s in him stuff 87 that puts 88 him to these ends:</p>
<p>For being not propped by ancestry 89 , whose grace 90</p>
<p>Chalks 91 successors their way, nor called upon</p>
<p>For high feats 92 done to th’crown, neither allied</p>
<p>To eminent assistants 93 self-drawing 94 , but spider-like,</p>
<p>Out of his self-drawing web, a gives us note 95 ,</p>
<p>The force of his own merit makes his way</p>
<p>A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys</p>
<p>A place next to 96 the king.</p>
<p>ABERGAVENNY I cannot tell</p>
<p>What heaven hath given him — let some graver 97 eye</p>
<p>Pierce into that — but I can see his pride</p>
<p>Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,</p>
<p>If not from hell? The devil is a niggard 98 ,</p>
<p>Or has given all before, and he 99 begins</p>
<p>A new hell in himself.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Why the devil,</p>
<p>Upon this French going out 100 , took he upon him,</p>
<p>Without the privity 101 o’th’king, t’appoint</p>
<p>Who should attend on him 102 ? He makes up the file 103</p>
<p>Of all the gentry: for the most part such</p>
<p>To whom as great a charge as little honour</p>
<p>He meant to lay upon 104 : and his own letter 105 ,</p>
<p>The honourable board of council 106 out 107 ,</p>
<p>Must fetch him in, he papers 108 .</p>
<p>ABERGAVENNY I do know</p>
<p>Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have</p>
<p>By this so sickened 109 their estates, that never</p>
<p>They shall abound 110 as formerly.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM O, many</p>
<p>Have broke their backs with laying manors on ’em 111</p>
<p>For this great journey. What did this vanity 112</p>
<p>But minister communication of</p>
<p>A most poor issue 113 ?</p>
<p>NORFOLK Grievingly 114 I think</p>
<p>The peace between the French and us not values 115</p>
<p>The cost that did conclude it.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Every man,</p>
<p>After the hideous storm that followed, was</p>
<p>A thing inspired 116 , and, not consulting 117 , broke</p>
<p>Into a general 118 prophecy: that this tempest,</p>
<p>Dashing 119 the garment of this peace, aboded 120</p>
<p>The sudden breach on’t 121 .</p>
<p>NORFOLK Which is budded out 122 ,</p>
<p>For France hath flawed 123 the league, and hath attached 124</p>
<p>Our merchants’ goods at Bordeaux.</p>
<p>ABERGAVENNY Is it therefore 125</p>
<p>Th’ambassador is silenced 126 ?</p>
<p>NORFOLK Marry 127 , is’t.</p>
<p>ABERGAVENNY A proper title of 128 a peace, and purchased</p>
<p>At a superfluous rate 129 .</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Why, all this business</p>
<p>Our reverend cardinal carried 130 .</p>
<p>NORFOLK Like it 131 your grace,</p>
<p>The state 132 takes notice of the private difference 133</p>
<p>Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you —</p>
<p>And take it from a heart that wishes towards you</p>
<p>Honour and plenteous safety — that you read 134</p>
<p>The cardinal’s malice and his potency 135</p>
<p>Together: to consider further that</p>
<p>What his high hatred would 136 effect wants 137 not</p>
<p>A minister 138 in his power. You know his nature,</p>
<p>That he’s revengeful: and I know his sword</p>
<p>Hath a sharp edge: it’s long and’t may be said,</p>
<p>It reaches far, and where ’twill not extend,</p>
<p>Thither he darts 139 it. Bosom up 140 my counsel,</p>
<p>You’ll find it wholesome 141 . Lo 142 , where comes that rock</p>
<p>That I advise your shunning.</p>
<p>Enter Cardinal Wolsey, the purse 143 borne before him, certain of the
Guard, and two Secretaries with papers. The Cardinal in his passage
fixeth his eye on Buckingham, and Buckingham on him, both full of
disdain</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY The Duke of Buckingham’s surveyor 144 , ha?</p>
<p>Where’s his examination 145 ?</p>
<p>SECRETARY Here, so please you.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Is he in person ready?</p>
<p>SECRETARY Ay, please your grace.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Well, we shall then know more, and Buckingham</p>
<p>Shall lessen this big 146 look.</p>
<p>Exeunt Cardinal and his train 147</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM This butcher’s cur 148 is venom-mouthed, and I</p>
<p>Have not the power to muzzle him: therefore best</p>
<p>Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar’s book</p>
<p>Outworths a noble’s blood 149 .</p>
<p>NORFOLK What, are you chafed 150 ?</p>
<p>Ask God for temp’rance 151 : that’s th’appliance only 152</p>
<p>Which your disease requires.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM I read in’s looks</p>
<p>Matter 153 against me, and his eye reviled</p>
<p>Me as his abject object 154 : at this instant</p>
<p>He bores 155 me with some trick: he’s gone to th’king:</p>
<p>I’ll follow, and outstare him.</p>
<p>NORFOLK Stay, my lord,</p>
<p>And let your reason with your choler 156 question</p>
<p>What ’tis you go about: to climb steep hills</p>
<p>Requires slow pace at first. Anger is like</p>
<p>A full hot 157 horse, who being allowed his way,</p>
<p>Self-mettle 158 tires him: not a man in England</p>
<p>Can advise me like you: be to yourself</p>
<p>As you would to your friend.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM I’ll to the king,</p>
<p>And from a mouth of honour 159 quite 160 cry down</p>
<p>This Ipswich 161 fellow’s insolence, or proclaim</p>
<p>There’s difference 162 in no persons.</p>
<p>NORFOLK Be advised 163 :</p>
<p>Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot</p>
<p>That it do singe yourself. We may outrun,</p>
<p>By violent swiftness, that which we run at,</p>
<p>And lose by overrunning 164 : know you not</p>
<p>The fire that mounts 165 the liquor till’t run o’er,</p>
<p>In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:</p>
<p>I say again there is no English soul</p>
<p>More stronger to direct you than yourself,</p>
<p>If with the sap of reason you would quench</p>
<p>Or but allay 166 the fire of passion.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Sir,</p>
<p>I am thankful to you, and I’ll go along</p>
<p>By your prescription 167 : but this top-proud 168 fellow —</p>
<p>Whom from the flow of gall 169 I name not, but</p>
<p>From sincere motions 170 — by intelligence 171 ,</p>
<p>And proofs as clear as founts 172 in July when</p>
<p>We see each grain of gravel, I do know</p>
<p>To be corrupt and treasonous.</p>
<p>NORFOLK Say not ‘treasonous’.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM To th’king I’ll say’t, and make my vouch 173 as strong</p>
<p>As shore of rock: attend. This holy fox,</p>
<p>Or wolf, or both — for he is equal 174 rav’nous</p>
<p>As he is subtle 175 and as prone to mischief</p>
<p>As able to perform’t, his mind and place 176</p>
<p>Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally —</p>
<p>Only to show his pomp 177 as well in France</p>
<p>As here at home, suggests 178 the king our master</p>
<p>To this last 179 costly treaty, th’interview 180</p>
<p>That swallowed so much treasure 181 , and like a glass</p>
<p>Did break i’th’wrenching 182 .</p>
<p>NORFOLK Faith, and so it did.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Pray give me favour 183 , sir: this cunning cardinal</p>
<p>The articles 184 o’th’combination 185 drew 186</p>
<p>As himself pleased: and they were ratified</p>
<p>As he cried ‘Thus let be’, to as much end 187</p>
<p>As give a crutch to th’dead. But our count-cardinal 188</p>
<p>Has done this, and ’tis well: for worthy Wolsey,</p>
<p>Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows —</p>
<p>Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy</p>
<p>To th’old dam 189 treason — Charles the Emperor 190 ,</p>
<p>Under pretence to see the queen his aunt —</p>
<p>For ’twas indeed his colour 191 , but he came</p>
<p>To whisper 192 Wolsey — here makes visitation:</p>
<p>His fears were that the interview betwixt</p>
<p>England and France might through their amity</p>
<p>Breed him some prejudice, for from this league</p>
<p>Peeped harms that menaced him. He privily 193</p>
<p>Deals with our cardinal, and as I trow 194 —</p>
<p>Which I do well, for I am sure the emperor</p>
<p>Paid ere 195 he promised, whereby his suit was granted</p>
<p>Ere it was asked — but 196 when the way was made</p>
<p>And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired</p>
<p>That he 197 would please to alter the king’s course,</p>
<p>And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,</p>
<p>As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal</p>
<p>Does buy and sell his 198 honour as he 199 pleases,</p>
<p>And for his own advantage.</p>
<p>NORFOLK I am sorry</p>
<p>To hear this of him, and could wish he were</p>
<p>Something 200 mistaken 201 in’t.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM No, not a syllable:</p>
<p>I do pronounce him in that very shape</p>
<p>He shall appear in proof 202 .</p>
<p>Enter Brandon, a Sergeant-at-Arms before him, and two or three of the
Guard</p>
<p>BRANDON Your office 203 , sergeant: execute it.</p>
<p>SERGEANT Sir,</p>
<p>To Buckingham</p>
<p>My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl</p>
<p>Of Hertford 204 , Stafford and Northampton, I</p>
<p>Arrest thee of high treason, in the name</p>
<p>Of our most sovereign king.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Lo you, my lord,</p>
<p>The net has fall’n upon me: I shall perish</p>
<p>Under device and practice 205 .</p>
<p>BRANDON I am sorry</p>
<p>To see you ta’en from liberty, to look on 206</p>
<p>The business present. ‘Tis his highness’ pleasure 207</p>
<p>You shall to th’Tower 208 .</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM It will help me nothing 209</p>
<p>To plead mine innocence, for that dye is on me</p>
<p>Which makes my whit’st part black. The will of heav’n</p>
<p>Be done in this and all things: I obey.</p>
<p>O my Lord Aberga’nny, fare you well.</p>
<p>BRANDON Nay, he must bear you company.— The king</p>
<p>To Abergavenny</p>
<p>Is pleased you shall to th’Tower, till you know</p>
<p>How he determines further.</p>
<p>ABERGAVENNY As the duke said,</p>
<p>The will of heaven be done, and the king’s pleasure</p>
<p>By me obeyed.</p>
<p>BRANDON Here is a warrant from</p>
<p>The king t’attach 210 Lord Montague and the bodies 211</p>
<p>Of the duke’s confessor, John de la Car,</p>
<p>One Gilbert Perk, his chancellor—</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM So, so;</p>
<p>These are the limbs o’th’plot: no more, I hope.</p>
<p>BRANDON A monk o’th’Chartreux 212 .</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM O, Nicholas Hopkins?</p>
<p>BRANDON He.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM My surveyor is false 213 : the o’er-great cardinal</p>
<p>Hath showed him gold 214 : my life is spanned 215 already:</p>
<p>I am the shadow of poor Buckingham 216 ,</p>
<p>Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,</p>
<p>By dark’ning my clear sun 217 . My lord, farewell.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
