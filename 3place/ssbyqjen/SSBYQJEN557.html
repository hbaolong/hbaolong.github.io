continues</h4>
<p>Enter Desdemona, Cassio and Emilia</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do</p>
<p>All my abilities in thy behalf.</p>
<p>EMILIA Good madam, do: I warrant 972 it grieves my husband</p>
<p>As if the cause were his.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA O, that’s an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,</p>
<p>But I will have my lord and you again</p>
<p>As friendly as you were.</p>
<p>CASSIO Bounteous madam,</p>
<p>Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,</p>
<p>He’s never anything but your true servant.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I know’t: I thank you. You do love my lord:</p>
<p>You have known him long, and be you well assured</p>
<p>He shall in strangeness 973 stand no further off</p>
<p>Than in a politic 974 distance.</p>
<p>CASSIO Ay, but, lady,</p>
<p>That policy may either last so long,</p>
<p>Or feed upon such nice and waterish 975 diet,</p>
<p>Or breed itself so out of circumstances 976 ,</p>
<p>That I being absent and my place supplied 977 ,</p>
<p>My general will forget my love and service.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Do not doubt 978 that: before Emilia here</p>
<p>I give thee warrant 979 of thy place. Assure thee,</p>
<p>If I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it</p>
<p>To the last article: my lord shall never rest,</p>
<p>I’ll watch him tame 980 and talk him out of patience;</p>
<p>His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift 981 :</p>
<p>I’ll intermingle everything he does</p>
<p>With Cassio’s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,</p>
<p>For thy solicitor 982 shall rather die</p>
<p>Than give thy cause away 983 .</p>
<p>Enter Othello and Iago</p>
<p>EMILIA Madam, here comes my lord.</p>
<p>CASSIO Madam, I’ll take my leave.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Why, stay and hear me speak.</p>
<p>CASSIO Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,</p>
<p>Unfit for mine own purposes.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Well, do your discretion 984 .</p>
<p>Exit Cassio</p>
<p>IAGO Ha? I like not that.</p>
<p>OTHELLO What dost thou say?</p>
<p>IAGO Nothing, my lord; or if — I know not what.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?</p>
<p>IAGO Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it,</p>
<p>That he would steal away so guilty-like,</p>
<p>Seeing your coming.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I do believe’twas he.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA How now, my lord?</p>
<p>I have been talking with a suitor 985 here,</p>
<p>A man that languishes in your displeasure.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Who is’t you mean?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,</p>
<p>If I have any grace 986 or power to move you,</p>
<p>His present reconciliation take 987 ,</p>
<p>For if he be not one that truly loves you,</p>
<p>That errs in ignorance and not in cunning 988 ,</p>
<p>I have no judgement in an honest face.</p>
<p>I prithee call him back.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Went he hence now?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Ay, sooth 989 ; so humbled</p>
<p>That he hath left part of his grief with me</p>
<p>To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Not now, sweet Desdemon: some other time.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA But shall’t be shortly?</p>
<p>OTHELLO The sooner, sweet, for you.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Shall’t be tonight at supper?</p>
<p>OTHELLO No, not tonight.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Tomorrow dinner 990 , then?</p>
<p>OTHELLO I shall not dine at home:</p>
<p>I meet the captains at the citadel.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Why then, tomorrow night, on Tuesday morn,</p>
<p>On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:</p>
<p>I prithee name the time, but let it not</p>
<p>Exceed three days. In faith, he’s penitent:</p>
<p>And yet his trespass 991 , in our common reason 992 —</p>
<p>Save that they say the wars must make example</p>
<p>Out of her best 993 — is not almost 994 a fault</p>
<p>T’incur a private check 995 . When shall he come?</p>
<p>Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul</p>
<p>What you would ask me that I should deny,</p>
<p>Or stand so mamm’ring 996 on. What? Michael Cassio,</p>
<p>That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time —</p>
<p>When I have spoke of you dispraisingly —</p>
<p>Hath ta’en your part: to have so much to do</p>
<p>To bring him in 997 ! Trust me, I could do much—</p>
<p>OTHELLO Prithee, no more: let him come when he will:</p>
<p>I will deny thee nothing.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Why, this is not a boon 998 :</p>
<p>’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,</p>
<p>Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,</p>
<p>Or sue to you to do a peculiar 999 profit</p>
<p>To your own person: nay, when I have a suit</p>
<p>Wherein I mean to touch 1000 your love indeed,</p>
<p>It shall be full of poise 1001 and difficult weight 1002 ,</p>
<p>And fearful to be granted.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I will deny thee nothing:</p>
<p>Whereon 1003 , I do beseech thee, grant me this,</p>
<p>To leave me but a little to myself.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Farewell, my Desdemona, I’ll come to thee straight 1004 .</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Emilia, come.— Be as your fancies 1005 teach you:</p>
<p>Whate’er you be, I am obedient.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Desdemona and Emilia ]</p>
<p>OTHELLO Excellent wretch! Perdition 1006 catch 1007 my soul,</p>
<p>But I do love thee! And when I love thee not,</p>
<p>Chaos is come again.</p>
<p>IAGO My noble lord—</p>
<p>OTHELLO What dost thou say, Iago?</p>
<p>IAGO Did Michael Cassio, when you wooed my lady,</p>
<p>Know of your love?</p>
<p>OTHELLO He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?</p>
<p>IAGO But for a satisfaction of my thought,</p>
<p>No further harm.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Why of thy thought, Iago?</p>
<p>IAGO I did not think he had been acquainted with her.</p>
<p>OTHELLO O, yes, and went between us very oft.</p>
<p>IAGO Indeed?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Indeed? Ay, indeed. Discern’st thou aught 1008 in that?</p>
<p>Is he not honest?</p>
<p>IAGO Honest, my lord?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Honest, ay, honest.</p>
<p>IAGO My lord, for aught I know.</p>
<p>OTHELLO What dost thou think?</p>
<p>IAGO Think, my lord?</p>
<p>OTHELLO ‘Think, my lord?’ Alas, thou echo’st me,</p>
<p>As if there were some monster in thy thought</p>
<p>Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.</p>
<p>I heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,</p>
<p>When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?</p>
<p>And when I told thee he was of my counsel</p>
<p>Of 1009 my whole course of wooing, thou cried’st ‘Indeed?’</p>
<p>And didst contract and purse 1010 thy brow together</p>
<p>As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain</p>
<p>Some horrible conceit 1011 : if thou dost love me,</p>
<p>Show me thy thought.</p>
<p>IAGO My lord, you know I love you.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I think thou dost,</p>
<p>And for 1012 I know thou’rt full of love and honesty,</p>
<p>And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath,</p>
<p>Therefore these stops 1013 of thine fright me the more,</p>
<p>For such things in a false 1014 disloyal knave</p>
<p>Are tricks of custom 1015 , but in a man that’s just</p>
<p>They’re close dilations 1016 , working from the heart</p>
<p>That passion cannot rule 1017 .</p>
<p>IAGO For Michael Cassio,</p>
<p>I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I think so too.</p>
<p>IAGO Men should be what they seem,</p>
<p>Or those that be not, would they might seem none 1018 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO Certain, men should be what they seem.</p>
<p>IAGO Why then, I think Cassio’s an honest man.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Nay, yet there’s more in this!</p>
<p>I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,</p>
<p>As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts</p>
<p>The worst of words.</p>
<p>IAGO Good my lord, pardon me:</p>
<p>Though I am bound to every act of duty,</p>
<p>I am not bound to that all slaves are free 1019 .</p>
<p>Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false,</p>
<p>As where’s that palace whereinto foul things</p>
<p>Sometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so pure,</p>
<p>Where no uncleanly 1020 apprehensions</p>
<p>Keep leets 1021 and law-days 1022 and in sessions 1023 sit</p>
<p>With 1024 meditations lawful?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Thou dost conspire against thy friend 1025 , Iago,</p>
<p>If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear</p>
<p>A stranger to thy thoughts.</p>
<p>IAGO I do beseech you,</p>
<p>Though I perchance am vicious 1026 in my guess —</p>
<p>As I confess it is my nature’s plague</p>
<p>To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy 1027</p>
<p>Shapes faults that are not — that your wisdom,</p>
<p>From one that so imperfectly conceits 1028 ,</p>
<p>Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble</p>
<p>Out of his scattering 1029 and unsure observance 1030 .</p>
<p>It were not for your quiet nor your good,</p>
<p>Nor for my manhood, honesty and wisdom,</p>
<p>To let you know my thoughts.</p>
<p>OTHELLO What dost thou mean?</p>
<p>IAGO Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,</p>
<p>Is the immediate 1031 jewel of their souls.</p>
<p>Who steals my purse steals trash, ’tis something, nothing;</p>
<p>’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands:</p>
<p>But he that filches from me my good name</p>
<p>Robs me of that which not enriches him</p>
<p>And makes me poor indeed.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I’ll know thy thoughts.</p>
<p>IAGO You cannot, if 1032 my heart were in your hand,</p>
<p>Nor shall not, whilst’tis in my custody.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ha?</p>
<p>IAGO O, beware, my lord, of jealousy:</p>
<p>It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock 1033</p>
<p>The meat it feeds on 1034 . That cuckold 1035 lives in bliss</p>
<p>Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger 1036 :</p>
<p>But, O, what damnèd minutes tells 1037 he o’er</p>
<p>Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet soundly loves!</p>
<p>OTHELLO O misery!</p>
<p>IAGO Poor and content is rich and rich enough,</p>
<p>But riches fineless 1038 is as poor as winter</p>
<p>To him that ever fears he shall be poor.</p>
<p>Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend</p>
<p>From jealousy!</p>
<p>OTHELLO Why? Why is this?</p>
<p>Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy,</p>
<p>To follow still the changes of the moon</p>
<p>With fresh suspicions 1039 ? No: to be once in doubt</p>
<p>Is to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat 1040</p>
<p>When I shall turn the business of my soul</p>
<p>To such exsufflicate 1041 and blowed 1042 surmises</p>
<p>Matching thy inference 1043 . ’Tis not to make me jealous</p>
<p>To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</p>
<p>Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances:</p>
<p>Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:</p>
<p>Nor from mine own weak merits 1044 will I draw</p>
<p>The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt 1045 ,</p>
<p>For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,</p>
<p>I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</p>
<p>And on the proof, there is no more but this:</p>
<p>Away at once with love or jealousy.</p>
<p>IAGO I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason</p>
<p>To show the love and duty that I bear you</p>
<p>With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,</p>
<p>Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof:</p>
<p>Look to your wife, observe her well with Cassio,</p>
<p>Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure 1046 .</p>
<p>I would not have your free and noble nature,</p>
<p>Out of self-bounty 1047 , be abused: look to’t.</p>
<p>I know our country 1048 disposition well:</p>
<p>In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks 1049</p>
<p>They dare not show their husbands: their best conscience</p>
<p>Is not to leave’t undone 1050 , but kept unknown.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Dost thou say so?</p>
<p>IAGO She did deceive her father, marrying you:</p>
<p>And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks,</p>
<p>She loved them most.</p>
<p>OTHELLO And so she did.</p>
<p>IAGO Why, go to 1051 then:</p>
<p>She that so young could give out such a seeming,</p>
<p>To seel 1052 her father’s eyes up close as oak 1053 ,</p>
<p>He thought ’twas witchcraft. But I am much to blame:</p>
<p>I humbly do beseech you of your pardon</p>
<p>For too much loving you.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I am bound 1054 to thee for ever.</p>
<p>IAGO I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Not a jot, not a jot.</p>
<p>IAGO Trust me, I fear it has.</p>
<p>I hope you will consider what is spoke</p>
<p>Comes from your love 1055 . But I do see you’re moved:</p>
<p>I am to pray you not to strain my speech</p>
<p>To grosser 1056 issues 1057 nor to larger 1058 reach 1059</p>
<p>Than to suspicion 1060 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO I will not.</p>
<p>IAGO Should you do so, my lord,</p>
<p>My speech should fall into such vile success 1061</p>
<p>Which my thoughts aimed not. Cassio’s my worthy friend.</p>
<p>My lord, I see you’re moved.</p>
<p>OTHELLO No, not much moved:</p>
<p>I do not think but Desdemona’s honest 1062 .</p>
<p>IAGO Long live she so; and long live you to think so!</p>
<p>OTHELLO And yet, how nature erring from itself—</p>
<p>IAGO Ay, there’s the point: as — to be bold with you —</p>
<p>Not to affect 1063 many proposèd matches</p>
<p>Of her own clime, complexion and degree 1064 ,</p>
<p>Whereto we see in all things nature tends—</p>
<p>Foh, one may smell in such a will 1065 most rank 1066 ,</p>
<p>Foul 1067 disproportions 1068 , thoughts unnatural.</p>
<p>But pardon me: I do not in position 1069</p>
<p>Distinctly 1070 speak of her, though I may fear</p>
<p>Her will, recoiling to her better judgement,</p>
<p>May fall to match you with her country forms 1071</p>
<p>And happily 1072 repent.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Farewell, farewell.</p>
<p>If more thou dost perceive, let me know more:</p>
<p>Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.</p>
<p>IAGO My lord, I take my leave.</p>
<p>Starts to leave</p>
<p>OTHELLO Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless</p>
<p>Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.</p>
<p>IAGO My lord, I would I might entreat your honour</p>
<p>Returns</p>
<p>To scan 1073 this thing no further: leave it to time.</p>
<p>Although ’tis fit that Cassio have his place 1074 ,</p>
<p>For sure he fills it up with great ability,</p>
<p>Yet, if you please to put him off awhile,</p>
<p>You shall by that perceive him and his means 1075 .</p>
<p>Note, if your lady strain his entertainment 1076</p>
<p>With any strong or vehement importunity,</p>
<p>Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,</p>
<p>Let me be thought too busy 1077 in my fears —</p>
<p>As worthy cause I have to fear I am —</p>
<p>And hold her free 1078 , I do beseech your honour.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Fear not my government 1079 .</p>
<p>IAGO I once more take my leave.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>OTHELLO This fellow’s of exceeding honesty,</p>
<p>And knows all quantities 1080 , with a learnèd spirit,</p>
<p>Of human dealings 1081 . If I do prove her haggard 1082 ,</p>
<p>Though that her jesses 1083 were my dear heartstrings,</p>
<p>I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind 1084</p>
<p>To prey at fortune 1085 . Haply, for 1086 I am black</p>
<p>And have not those soft parts of conversation 1087</p>
<p>That chamberers 1088 have, or for I am declined</p>
<p>Into the vale of years — yet that’s not much —</p>
<p>She’s gone. I am abused 1089 , and my relief</p>
<p>Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage!</p>
<p>That we can call these delicate 1090 creatures ours</p>
<p>And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad</p>
<p>And live upon the vapour of a dungeon</p>
<p>Than keep a corner 1091 in the thing I love</p>
<p>For others’ uses 1092 . Yet, ’tis the plague to great ones,</p>
<p>Prerogatived 1093 are they less than the base:</p>
<p>’Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:</p>
<p>Even then this forkèd plague 1094 is fated to us</p>
<p>When we do quicken 1095 . Look where she comes:</p>
<p>Enter Desdemona and Emilia</p>
<p>If she be false, heaven mocked 1096 itself!</p>
<p>I’ll not believe’t.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA How now, my dear Othello?</p>
<p>Your dinner, and the generous 1097 islanders</p>
<p>By you invited, do attend 1098 your presence.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I am to blame.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Why do you speak so faintly?</p>
<p>Are you not well?</p>
<p>OTHELLO I have a pain upon my forehead 1099 here.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Why, that’s with watching 1100 . ’Twill away again:</p>
<p>Let me but bind it hard, within this hour</p>
<p>Offers her handkerchief</p>
<p>It will be well.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Your napkin 1101 is too little:</p>
<p>He pushes away the handkerchief and it drops</p>
<p>Let it alone. Come, I’ll go in with you.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I am very sorry that you are not well.</p>
<p>Following him</p>
<p>EMILIA I am glad I have found this napkin:</p>
<p>Picks up the handkerchief</p>
<p>This was her first remembrance 1102 from the Moor:</p>
<p>My wayward husband hath a hundred times</p>
<p>Wooed 1103 me to steal it, but she so loves the token —</p>
<p>For he conjured her 1104 she should ever keep it —</p>
<p>That she reserves 1105 it evermore about her</p>
<p>To kiss and talk to. I’ll have the work ta’en out 1106 ,</p>
<p>And give’t Iago: what he will do with it</p>
<p>Heaven knows, not I:</p>
<p>I nothing 1107 but to please his fantasy 1108 .</p>
<p>Enter Iago</p>
<p>IAGO How now? What do you here alone?</p>
<p>EMILIA Do not you chide: I have a thing for you.</p>
<p>IAGO You have a thing for me? It is a common 1109 thing 1110 —</p>
<p>EMILIA Ha?</p>
<p>IAGO To have a foolish wife.</p>
<p>EMILIA O, is that all? What will you give me now</p>
<p>For the same handkerchief?</p>
<p>IAGO What handkerchief?</p>
<p>EMILIA What handkerchief?</p>
<p>Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,</p>
<p>That which so often you did bid me steal.</p>
<p>IAGO Hast stol’n it from her?</p>
<p>EMILIA No, but she let it drop by negligence.</p>
<p>And, to th’advantage 1111 , I, being here, took’t up.</p>
<p>Look, here ’tis.</p>
<p>IAGO A good wench: give it me.</p>
<p>EMILIA What will you do with’t, that you have been</p>
<p>So earnest to have me filch it?</p>
<p>IAGO Why, what is that to you?</p>
<p>Santches it</p>
<p>EMILIA If it be not for some purpose of import,</p>
<p>Give’t me again: poor lady, she’ll run mad</p>
<p>When she shall lack 1112 it.</p>
<p>IAGO Be not acknown on’t 1113 : I have use for it.</p>
<p>Go, leave me.</p>
<p>Exit Emilia</p>
<p>I will in Cassio’s lodging loose this napkin</p>
<p>And let him find it. Trifles light as air</p>
<p>Are to the jealous confirmations strong</p>
<p>As proofs of holy writ 1114 : this may do something.</p>
<p>The Moor already changes with my poison:</p>
<p>Dangerous conceits 1115 are in their natures poisons,</p>
<p>Which at the first are scarce found to distaste 1116 ,</p>
<p>But with a little act 1117 upon the blood,</p>
<p>Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so:</p>
<p>Enter Othello</p>
<p>At a distance</p>
<p>Look, where he comes! Not poppy 1118 , nor mandragora 1119 ,</p>
<p>Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world</p>
<p>Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep</p>
<p>Which thou owed’st 1120 yesterday.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ha, ha, false to me?</p>
<p>IAGO Why how now, general? No more of that.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Avaunt 1121 , be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack 1122
:</p>
<p>I swear ’tis better to be much abused</p>
<p>Than but to know’t a little.</p>
<p>IAGO How now, my lord?</p>
<p>OTHELLO What sense had I in her stol’n hours of lust?</p>
<p>I saw’t not, thought it not, it harmed not me:</p>
<p>I slept the next night well, fed well, was free 1123 and merry:</p>
<p>I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.</p>
<p>He that is robbed, not wanting 1124 what is stol’n,</p>
<p>Let him not know’t and he’s not robbed at all.</p>
<p>IAGO I am sorry to hear this.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I had been happy, if the general camp,</p>
<p>Pioneers 1125 and all, had tasted her sweet body,</p>
<p>So 1126 I had nothing known. O, now, for ever</p>
<p>Farewell the tranquil mind; farewell content;</p>
<p>Farewell the plumèd 1127 troops and the big wars</p>
<p>That makes ambition virtue! O, farewell!</p>
<p>Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump 1128 ,</p>
<p>The spirit-stirring drum, th’ear-piercing fife 1129 ,</p>
<p>The royal banner, and all quality 1130 ,</p>
<p>Pride 1131 , pomp and circumstance 1132 of glorious war!</p>
<p>And, O, you mortal engines 1133 , whose rude 1134 throats</p>
<p>Th’immortal Jove’s dread clamours 1135 counterfeit,</p>
<p>Farewell! Othello’s occupation’s gone.</p>
<p>IAGO Is’t possible, my lord?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;</p>
<p>Grabs him</p>
<p>Be sure of it: give me the ocular proof,</p>
<p>Or by the worth of mine eternal soul,</p>
<p>Thou hadst been better have been born a dog</p>
<p>Than answer my waked wrath!</p>
<p>IAGO Is’t come to this?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Make me to see’t, or at the least so prove it</p>
<p>That the probation 1136 bear no hinge nor loop</p>
<p>To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!</p>
<p>IAGO My noble lord—</p>
<p>OTHELLO If thou dost slander her and torture me,</p>
<p>Never pray more: abandon all remorse 1137 ,</p>
<p>On horror’s head horrors accumulate,</p>
<p>Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed 1138 ,</p>
<p>For nothing canst thou to damnation add</p>
<p>Greater than that.</p>
<p>IAGO O grace! O heaven forgive me!</p>
<p>Are you a man? Have you a soul? Or sense?</p>
<p>God b’wi’you 1139 , take mine office. O wretched fool 1140 ,</p>
<p>That lov’st to make thine honesty a vice!</p>
<p>O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,</p>
<p>To be direct and honest is not safe.</p>
<p>I thank you for this profit 1141 , and from hence</p>
<p>I’ll love no friend, sith 1142 love breeds such offence 1143 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO Nay, stay: thou shouldst be 1144 honest.</p>
<p>IAGO I should be 1145 wise, for honesty’s a fool</p>
<p>And loses that 1146 it works for.</p>
<p>OTHELLO By the world,</p>
<p>I think my wife be honest and think she is not:</p>
<p>I think that thou art just and think thou art not.</p>
<p>I’ll have some proof. My name, that was as fresh</p>
<p>As Dian 1147 ’s visage, is now begrimed and black</p>
<p>As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,</p>
<p>Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams 1148 ,</p>
<p>I’ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!</p>
<p>IAGO I see you are eaten up with passion:</p>
<p>I do repent me that I put it to you.</p>
<p>You would be satisfied?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Would? Nay, and I will.</p>
<p>IAGO And may: but, how? How satisfied, my lord?</p>
<p>Would you the supervision 1149 grossly 1150 gape on?</p>
<p>Behold her topped 1151 ?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Death and damnation! O!</p>
<p>IAGO It were a tedious difficulty, I think,</p>
<p>To bring them to that prospect 1152 : damn them then,</p>
<p>If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster 1153</p>
<p>More 1154 than their own 1155 . What then? How then?</p>
<p>What shall I say? Where’s satisfaction 1156 ?</p>
<p>It is impossible you should see this,</p>
<p>Were they as prime 1157 as goats, as hot 1158 as monkeys,</p>
<p>As salt 1159 as wolves 1160 in pride 1161 , and fools 1162 as gross
1163</p>
<p>As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,</p>
<p>If imputation and strong circumstances 1164</p>
<p>Which lead directly to the door of truth</p>
<p>Will give you satisfaction, you might have’t.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.</p>
<p>IAGO I do not like the office,</p>
<p>But sith I am entered in this cause so far —</p>
<p>Pricked 1165 to’t by foolish honesty and love —</p>
<p>I will go on. I lay 1166 with Cassio lately,</p>
<p>And being troubled with a raging tooth</p>
<p>I could not sleep. There are a kind of men</p>
<p>So loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter</p>
<p>Their affairs: one of this kind is Cassio.</p>
<p>In sleep I heard him say, ’Sweet Desdemona,</p>
<p>Let us be wary, let us hide our loves’:</p>
<p>And then, sir, would he grip and wring my hand,</p>
<p>Cry’O sweet creature!’ then kiss me hard,</p>
<p>As if he plucked up kisses by the roots</p>
<p>That grew upon my lips, laid his leg</p>
<p>O’er my thigh, and sigh 1167 , and kiss, and then</p>
<p>Cry, ‘Cursèd fate that gave thee to the Moor!’</p>
<p>OTHELLO O monstrous! Monstrous!</p>
<p>IAGO Nay, this was but his dream.</p>
<p>OTHELLO But this denoted a foregone conclusion 1168 :</p>
<p>’Tis a shrewd doubt 1169 , though it be but a dream.</p>
<p>IAGO And this may help to thicken other proofs</p>
<p>That do demonstrate thinly.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I’ll tear her all to pieces.</p>
<p>IAGO Nay, yet 1170 be wise: yet we see nothing done,</p>
<p>She may be honest yet. Tell me but this:</p>
<p>Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief</p>
<p>Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?</p>
<p>OTHELLO I gave her such a one: ’twas my first gift.</p>
<p>IAGO I know not that, but such a handkerchief —</p>
<p>I am sure it was your wife’s — did I today</p>
<p>See Cassio wipe his beard with.</p>
<p>OTHELLO If it be that—</p>
<p>IAGO If it be that, or any it was hers,</p>
<p>It speaks against her with the other proofs.</p>
<p>OTHELLO O, that the slave 1171 had forty thousand lives:</p>
<p>One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.</p>
<p>Now do I see’tis true. Look here, Iago,</p>
<p>All my fond 1172 love thus do I blow to heaven.</p>
<p>’Tis gone.</p>
<p>Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell!</p>
<p>Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted 1173 throne</p>
<p>To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught 1174 ,</p>
<p>For ‘tis of aspics 1175’ tongues!</p>
<p>IAGO Yet be content.</p>
<p>OTHELLO O, blood, blood, blood!</p>
<p>IAGO Patience, I say: your mind may change.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic sea 1176 ,</p>
<p>Whose icy current and compulsive 1177 course</p>
<p>Ne’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on</p>
<p>To the Propontic 1178 and the Hellespont 1179 ,</p>
<p>Even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace</p>
<p>Shall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love,</p>
<p>Till that a capable 1180 and wide revenge</p>
<p>Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble 1181 heaven,</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>In the due reverence of a sacred vow</p>
<p>I here engage 1182 my words.</p>
<p>Attempts to rise</p>
<p>IAGO Do not rise yet.</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>Witness, you ever-burning lights above,</p>
<p>You elements that clip 1183 us round about,</p>
<p>Witness that here Iago doth give up</p>
<p>The execution 1184 of his wit 1185 , hands, heart,</p>
<p>To wronged Othello’s service! Let him command,</p>
<p>And to obey shall be in me remorse 1186 ,</p>
<p>What bloody business ever 1187 .</p>
<p>They rise</p>
<p>OTHELLO I greet thy love,</p>
<p>Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,</p>
<p>And will upon the instant put thee to’t 1188 :</p>
<p>Within these three days let me hear thee say</p>
<p>That Cassio’s not alive.</p>
<p>IAGO My friend is dead:</p>
<p>’Tis done at your request. But let her live.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Damn her, lewd minx 1189 ! O, damn her, damn her!</p>
<p>Come, go with me apart: I will withdraw</p>
<p>To furnish me with some swift means of death</p>
<p>For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.</p>
<p>IAGO I am your own for ever.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
