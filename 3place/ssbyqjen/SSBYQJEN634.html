<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-14">Scene 2 / running scene 14</h4>
<p>Enter Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus and Innogen from the cave</p>
<p>Innogen disguised as Fidele</p>
<p>BELARIUS You are not well: remain here in the cave,</p>
<p>To Innogen</p>
<p>We’ll come to you after hunting.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Brother, stay here:</p>
<p>To Innogen</p>
<p>Are we not brothers?</p>
<p>INNOGEN So man and man should be,</p>
<p>But clay and clay differs in dignity,</p>
<p>Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Go you to hunting, I’ll abide with him.</p>
<p>INNOGEN So sick I am not, yet I am not well:</p>
<p>But not so citizen 1287 a wanton 1288 as</p>
<p>To seem to die ere 1289 sick: so please you, leave me,</p>
<p>Stick to your journal 1290 course: the breach of custom 1291</p>
<p>Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me</p>
<p>Cannot amend me 1292 . Society 1293 is no comfort</p>
<p>To one not sociable: I am not very sick,</p>
<p>Since I can reason of 1294 it: pray you trust me here,</p>
<p>I’ll rob none 1295 but myself, and let me die,</p>
<p>Stealing so poorly 1296 .</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS I love thee: I have spoke it,</p>
<p>How much the quantity, the weight 1297 as much,</p>
<p>As I do love my father.</p>
<p>BELARIUS What? How? How?</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS If it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me 1298</p>
<p>In my good brother’s fault: I know not why</p>
<p>I love this youth, and I have heard you say</p>
<p>Love’s reason’s without reason. The bier at door 1299 ,</p>
<p>And a demand who is’t shall die, I’d say</p>
<p>‘My father, not this youth.’</p>
<p>BELARIUS O noble strain 1300 !</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>O worthiness of nature, breed 1301 of greatness!</p>
<p>Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base:</p>
<p>Nature hath meal and bran 1302 , contempt and grace. I</p>
<p>’m not their father, yet who this should be</p>
<p>Doth miracle itself, loved before me 1303 .—</p>
<p>’Tis the ninth hour o’th’morn.</p>
<p>Aloud</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Brother, farewell.</p>
<p>INNOGEN I wish ye sport.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS You health.— So please you, sir 1304 .</p>
<p>INNOGEN These are kind creatures.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Gods, what lies I have heard!</p>
<p>Our courtiers say all’s savage but 1305 at court;</p>
<p>Experience, O, thou disprov’st report!</p>
<p>Th’imperious seas breeds monsters; for the dish</p>
<p>Poor tributary 1306 rivers as sweet fish:</p>
<p>I am sick still, heart-sick. Pisanio,</p>
<p>I’ll now taste of thy drug.</p>
<p>Drinks</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS I could not stir 1307 him:</p>
<p>He said he was gentle 1308 , but unfortunate;</p>
<p>Dishonestly afflicted 1309 , but yet honest.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Thus did he answer me, yet said hereafter</p>
<p>I might know more.</p>
<p>BELARIUS To th’field 1310 , to th’field!</p>
<p>We’ll leave you for this time, go in and rest.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS We’ll not be long away.</p>
<p>BELARIUS Pray be not sick,</p>
<p>For you must be our housewife.</p>
<p>INNOGEN Well or ill,</p>
<p>I am bound 1311 to you.</p>
<p>Exit [into the cave]</p>
<p>BELARIUS And shalt be ever.</p>
<p>This youth, howe’er distressed 1312 , appears he hath had</p>
<p>Good ancestors.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS How angel-like he sings!</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS But his neat cookery! He cut our roots 1313 in characters
1314 ,</p>
<p>And sauced our broths as 1315 Juno 1316 had been sick</p>
<p>And he her dieter 1317 .</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Nobly he yokes 1318</p>
<p>A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh</p>
<p>Was that 1319 it was for not being such a smile:</p>
<p>The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly</p>
<p>From so divine a temple, to commix 1320</p>
<p>With winds that sailors rail 1321 at.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS I do note</p>
<p>That grief and patience, rooted in him both,</p>
<p>Mingle their spurs 1322 together.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Grow 1323 patience,</p>
<p>And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine</p>
<p>His perishing root with 1324 the increasing vine.</p>
<p>BELARIUS It is great morning 1325 . Come away.— Who’s there?</p>
<p>Enter Cloten</p>
<p>CLOTEN I cannot find those runagates 1326 , that villain</p>
<p>Hath mocked 1327 me. I am faint.</p>
<p>BELARIUS ‘Those runagates’?</p>
<p>Means he not us? I partly know him, ’tis</p>
<p>Cloten, the son o’th’queen. I fear some ambush.</p>
<p>I saw him not these many years, and yet</p>
<p>I know ’tis he. We are held 1328 as outlaws: hence!</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS He is but 1329 one: you and my brother search</p>
<p>What companies 1330 are near: pray you away,</p>
<p>Let me alone with him.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Belarius and Arviragus]</p>
<p>CLOTEN Soft 1331 , what are you</p>
<p>That fly 1332 me thus? Some villain mountaineers?</p>
<p>I have heard of such. What slave art thou?</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS A thing</p>
<p>More slavish did I ne’er than answering</p>
<p>A slave without a knock 1333 .</p>
<p>CLOTEN Thou art a robber,</p>
<p>A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I</p>
<p>An arm as big as thine? A heart as big?</p>
<p>Thy words I grant are bigger, for I wear not</p>
<p>My dagger in my mouth 1334 . Say what thou art,</p>
<p>Why I should yield to thee?</p>
<p>CLOTEN Thou villain base,</p>
<p>Know’st me not by my clothes 1335 ?</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS No, nor thy tailor, rascal,</p>
<p>Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,</p>
<p>Which, as it seems, make thee.</p>
<p>CLOTEN Thou precious varlet 1336 ,</p>
<p>My tailor made them not.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Hence, then, and thank</p>
<p>The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool,</p>
<p>I am loath 1337 to beat thee.</p>
<p>CLOTEN Thou injurious 1338 thief,</p>
<p>Hear but my name, and tremble.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS What’s thy name?</p>
<p>CLOTEN Cloten, thou villain.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Cloten, thou double villain be thy name,</p>
<p>I cannot tremble at it: were it toad, or adder, spider,</p>
<p>’Twould move me sooner.</p>
<p>CLOTEN To thy further fear,</p>
<p>Nay, to thy mere confusion 1339 , thou shalt know</p>
<p>I am son to th’queen.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS I am sorry for’t: not seeming 1340</p>
<p>So 1341 worthy as thy birth.</p>
<p>CLOTEN Art not afeard?</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Those that I reverence, those I fear, the wise:</p>
<p>At fools I laugh, not fear them.</p>
<p>CLOTEN Die the death:</p>
<p>When I have slain thee with my proper 1342 hand,</p>
<p>I’ll follow those that even now fled hence,</p>
<p>And on the gates of Lud’s town set your heads 1343 :</p>
<p>Yield, rustic mountaineer.</p>
<p>Fight and exeunt</p>
<p>Enter Belarius and Arviragus</p>
<p>BELARIUS No company’s abroad 1344 ?</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS None in the world: you did mistake him, sure 1345 .</p>
<p>BELARIUS I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,</p>
<p>But time hath nothing blurred those lines of favour 1346</p>
<p>Which then he wore: the snatches 1347 in his voice</p>
<p>And burst of speaking were as his: I am absolute 1348</p>
<p>’Twas very 1349 Cloten.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS In this place we left them.</p>
<p>I wish my brother make good time with 1350 him,</p>
<p>You say he is so fell 1351 .</p>
<p>BELARIUS Being scarce made up,</p>
<p>I mean to man 1352 , he had not apprehension 1353</p>
<p>Of roaring terrors: for defect of judgement 1354</p>
<p>Is oft the cause of fear.</p>
<p>Enter Guiderius</p>
<p>With Cloten’s head</p>
<p>But see thy brother.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse,</p>
<p>There was no money in’t: not Hercules 1355</p>
<p>Could have knocked out his brains, for he had none:</p>
<p>Yet I not doing this 1356 , the fool had borne</p>
<p>My head, as I do his.</p>
<p>BELARIUS What hast thou done?</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS I am perfect 1357 what: cut off one Cloten’s head,</p>
<p>Son to the queen, after 1358 his own report,</p>
<p>Who called me traitor, mountaineer, and swore</p>
<p>With his own single hand he’d take us 1359 in,</p>
<p>Displace our heads where — thank the gods — they grow,</p>
<p>And set them on Lud’s town.</p>
<p>BELARIUS We are all undone.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Why, worthy father, what have we to lose</p>
<p>But that he swore to take, our lives? The law</p>
<p>Protects not us 1360 , then why should we be tender 1361</p>
<p>To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat 1362 us,</p>
<p>Play judge and executioner all himself,</p>
<p>For 1363 we do fear the law? What company</p>
<p>Discover you abroad?</p>
<p>BELARIUS No single soul</p>
<p>Can we set eye on, but in all safe 1364 reason</p>
<p>He must have some attendants. Though his humour 1365</p>
<p>Was nothing but mutation 1366 , ay, and that</p>
<p>From one bad thing to worse, not frenzy,</p>
<p>Not absolute madness could so far have raved</p>
<p>To bring him here alone: although perhaps</p>
<p>It may be heard at court that such as we</p>
<p>Cave 1367 here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time</p>
<p>May make some stronger head 1368 , the which he hearing —</p>
<p>As it is like him 1369 — might break out 1370 and swear</p>
<p>He’d fetch us 1371 in, yet is’t not probable</p>
<p>To come 1372 alone, either he so undertaking,</p>
<p>Or they so suffering 1373 : then on good ground we fear,</p>
<p>If we do fear this body hath a tail 1374</p>
<p>More perilous than the head.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Let ord’nance 1375</p>
<p>Come as the gods foresay 1376 it: howsoe’er 1377 ,</p>
<p>My brother hath done well.</p>
<p>BELARIUS I had no mind 1378</p>
<p>To hunt this day: the boy Fidele’s sickness</p>
<p>Did make my way long forth 1379 .</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS With his own sword,</p>
<p>Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta’en</p>
<p>His head from him: I’ll throw’t into the creek</p>
<p>Behind our rock, and let it to 1380 the sea</p>
<p>And tell the fishes he’s the queen’s son, Cloten:</p>
<p>That’s all I reck 1381 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>BELARIUS I fear ’twill be revenged:</p>
<p>Would, Polydore, thou hadst not done’t, though valour</p>
<p>Becomes thee well enough.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Would I had done’t,</p>
<p>So 1382 the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,</p>
<p>I love thee brotherly, but envy much</p>
<p>Thou hast robbed me of this deed: I would 1383 revenges</p>
<p>That possible strength 1384 might meet 1385 would seek us through</p>
<p>And put us to our answer 1386 .</p>
<p>BELARIUS Well, ’tis done:</p>
<p>We’ll hunt no more today, nor seek for danger</p>
<p>Where there’s no profit. I prithee, to our rock,</p>
<p>You and Fidele play the cooks: I’ll stay</p>
<p>Till hasty 1387 Polydore return, and bring him</p>
<p>To dinner presently.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Poor sick Fidele!</p>
<p>I’ll willingly to him: to gain 1388 his colour</p>
<p>I’d let a parish of such Clotens’ blood 1389 ,</p>
<p>And praise myself for charity.</p>
<p>Exit [into the cave]</p>
<p>BELARIUS O thou goddess,</p>
<p>Thou divine Nature, thou thyself thou blazon’st 1390</p>
<p>In these two princely boys! They are as gentle</p>
<p>As zephyrs 1391 blowing below the violet,</p>
<p>Not wagging 1392 his sweet head; and yet as rough,</p>
<p>Their royal blood enchafed 1393 , as the rud’st 1394 wind,</p>
<p>That by the top doth take the mountain pine,</p>
<p>And make him stoop to th’vale. ’Tis wonder</p>
<p>That an invisible instinct should frame 1395 them</p>
<p>To royalty unlearned, honour untaught,</p>
<p>Civility not seen from other 1396 , valour</p>
<p>That wildly 1397 grows in them, but yields a crop</p>
<p>As if it had been sowed. Yet still it’s strange</p>
<p>What Cloten’s being here to us portends,</p>
<p>Or what his death will bring us.</p>
<p>Enter Guiderius</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Where’s my brother?</p>
<p>I have sent Cloten’s clotpoll 1398 down the stream</p>
<p>In embassy to his mother; his body’s hostage</p>
<p>For his return.</p>
<p>Solemn music</p>
<p>BELARIUS My ingenious 1399 instrument!</p>
<p>Hark, Polydore, it sounds: but what occasion 1400</p>
<p>Hath Cadwal now to give it motion 1401 ? Hark!</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Is he at home?</p>
<p>BELARIUS He went hence even now.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS What does he mean? Since death of my dear’st mother</p>
<p>It did not speak 1402 before. All solemn things</p>
<p>Should answer 1403 solemn accidents 1404 . The matter?</p>
<p>Triumphs 1405 for nothing and lamenting toys 1406</p>
<p>Is jollity for apes 1407 and grief for boys 1408 .</p>
<p>Is Cadwal mad?</p>
<p>Enter Arviragus, with Innogen dead, bearing her in his arms</p>
<p>BELARIUS Look, here he comes,</p>
<p>And brings the dire occasion in his arms</p>
<p>Of what we blame him for.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS The bird is dead</p>
<p>That we have made so much on 1409 . I had rather</p>
<p>Have skipped from sixteen years of age to sixty,</p>
<p>To have turned my leaping time into a crutch 1410 ,</p>
<p>Than have seen this.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS O sweetest, fairest lily!</p>
<p>My brother wears thee not the one half so well 1411</p>
<p>As when thou grew’st thyself.</p>
<p>BELARIUS O melancholy,</p>
<p>Who ever yet could sound thy bottom 1412 ? Find 1413</p>
<p>The ooze 1414 to show what coast thy sluggish 1415 crare 1416</p>
<p>Might easiliest 1417 harbour in 1418 ? Thou blessèd thing,</p>
<p>Jove knows what man thou mightst have made: but, ay,</p>
<p>Thou died’st a most rare 1419 boy, of melancholy.</p>
<p>How found you him?</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Stark 1420 , as you see:</p>
<p>Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber 1421 ,</p>
<p>Not as death’s dart being laughed at 1422 : his right cheek</p>
<p>Reposing on a cushion.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Where?</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS O’th’floor:</p>
<p>His arms thus leagued 1423 , I thought he slept, and put</p>
<p>My clouted brogues 1424 from off my feet, whose rudeness 1425</p>
<p>Answered my steps too loud 1426 .</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Why, he but 1427 sleeps:</p>
<p>If he be gone, he’ll make his grave a bed 1428 :</p>
<p>With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,</p>
<p>And worms will not come to thee.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS With fairest flowers</p>
<p>Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,</p>
<p>I’ll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack</p>
<p>The flower that’s like thy face, pale primrose, nor</p>
<p>The azured 1429 harebell 1430 , like thy veins: no, nor</p>
<p>The leaf of eglantine 1431 , whom not to slander,</p>
<p>Out-sweetened not thy breath: the ruddock 1432 would</p>
<p>With charitable bill — O bill sore shaming</p>
<p>Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie</p>
<p>Without a monument! — bring thee all this,</p>
<p>Yea, and furred moss besides, when flowers are none,</p>
<p>To winter-ground 1433 thy corpse—</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Prithee, have done,</p>
<p>And do not play in wench-like 1434 words with that</p>
<p>Which is so serious. Let us bury him,</p>
<p>And not protract with admiration 1435 what</p>
<p>Is now due debt 1436 . To th’grave.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Say, where shall’s 1437 lay him?</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS By good Euriphile, our mother.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Be’t so:</p>
<p>And let us, Polydore, though now our voices</p>
<p>Have got the mannish crack 1438 , sing him to th’ground</p>
<p>As once 1439 our mother: use like 1440 note and words,</p>
<p>Save 1441 that Euriphile must be Fidele.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Cadwal,</p>
<p>I cannot sing: I’ll weep, and word 1442 it with thee,</p>
<p>For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse</p>
<p>Than priests and fanes 1443 that lie.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS We’ll speak it, then.</p>
<p>BELARIUS Great griefs, I see, med’cine the less 1444 , for Cloten</p>
<p>Is quite forgot. He was a queen’s son, boys,</p>
<p>And though he came 1445 our enemy, remember</p>
<p>He was paid 1446 for that: though mean and mighty rotting</p>
<p>Together have one dust 1447 , yet reverence 1448 ,</p>
<p>That angel of the world, doth make distinction</p>
<p>Of place ’tween high and low. Our foe was princely,</p>
<p>And though you took his life as being our foe,</p>
<p>Yet bury him as a prince.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Pray you fetch him hither.</p>
<p>Thersites 1449 ’ body is as good as Ajax 1450 ’</p>
<p>When neither are alive.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS If you’ll go fetch him,</p>
<p>We’ll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.</p>
<p>[Exit Belarius]</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th’east 1451 .</p>
<p>My father hath a reason for’t.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS ’Tis true.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Come on then, and remove 1452 him.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS So, begin.</p>
<p>Song</p>
<p>Spoken or chanted, not sung?</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Fear no more the heat o’th’sun,</p>
<p>Nor the furious winter’s rages,</p>
<p>Thou thy worldly task hast done,</p>
<p>Home 1453 art gone, and ta’en thy wages 1454 .</p>
<p>Golden 1455 lads and girls all must,</p>
<p>As 1456 chimney-sweepers, come to dust.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Fear no more the frown o’th’great,</p>
<p>Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke,</p>
<p>Care no more to clothe and eat,</p>
<p>To thee the reed is as the oak.</p>
<p>The sceptre, learning, physic 1457 , must</p>
<p>All follow this and come to dust.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Fear no more the lightning flash,</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Nor th’all-dreaded thunder-stone 1458 .</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Fear not slander, censure rash.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Thou hast finished joy and moan.</p>
<p>BOTH All lovers young, all lovers must</p>
<p>Consign to thee 1459 and come to dust.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS No exorcizer 1460 harm thee,</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Nor no witchcraft charm 1461 thee.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Ghost unlaid forbear thee 1462 .</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Nothing ill come near thee.</p>
<p>BOTH Quiet consummation 1463 have,</p>
<p>And renownèd be thy grave.</p>
<p>Enter Belarius with the body of Cloten</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS We have done our obsequies 1464 : come, lay him down.</p>
<p>BELARIUS Here’s a few flowers, but ’bout midnight more:</p>
<p>The herbs that have on them cold dew o’th’night</p>
<p>Are strewings fitt’st for graves: upon their faces 1465 .</p>
<p>You were as flowers, now withered: even so</p>
<p>These herblets shall 1466 , which we upon you strew.</p>
<p>Come on, away, apart upon our knees 1467 :</p>
<p>The ground that gave them first 1468 has them again:</p>
<p>Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.</p>
<p>Exeunt [all but Innogen]</p>
<p>INNOGEN Yes, sir, to Milford Haven, which is the way?</p>
<p>Awakes</p>
<p>I thank you: by yond bush? Pray how far thither?</p>
<p>’Od’s pittikins 1469 : can it be six mile yet?</p>
<p>I have gone 1470 all night: faith, I’ll lie down and sleep.</p>
<p>Sees Cloten’s body</p>
<p>But soft, no bedfellow 1471 ! O gods and goddesses!</p>
<p>These flowers are like the pleasures of the world,</p>
<p>This bloody man the care on’t 1472 . I hope I dream:</p>
<p>For so 1473 I thought I was a cave-keeper,</p>
<p>And cook to honest creatures. But ’tis not so:</p>
<p>’Twas but a bolt 1474 of nothing, shot at nothing,</p>
<p>Which the brain makes of fumes 1475 . Our very eyes</p>
<p>Are sometimes like our judgements, blind. Good faith,</p>
<p>I tremble still with fear: but if there be</p>
<p>Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity</p>
<p>As a wren’s eye 1476 , feared gods, a part 1477 of it!</p>
<p>The dream’s here still: even when I wake it is</p>
<p>Without me 1478 , as within me: not imagined, felt 1479 .</p>
<p>A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?</p>
<p>I know the shape of’s leg: this is his hand:</p>
<p>His foot mercurial: his martial thigh:</p>
<p>The brawns 1480 of Hercules: but his jovial face 1481 —</p>
<p>Murder in heaven! How? ’Tis gone. Pisanio,</p>
<p>All curses madded 1482 Hecuba 1483 gave the Greeks,</p>
<p>And mine to boot, be darted 1484 on thee! Thou,</p>
<p>Conspired 1485 with that irregulous 1486 devil, Cloten,</p>
<p>Hath here cut off my lord. To write and read</p>
<p>Be henceforth treacherous! Damned Pisanio</p>
<p>Hath with his forgèd letters — damned Pisanio —</p>
<p>From this most bravest 1487 vessel 1488 of 1489 the world</p>
<p>Struck the main-top 1490 ! O Posthumus, alas,</p>
<p>Where is thy head? Where’s that? Ay me! Where’s that?</p>
<p>Pisanio might have killed thee at the heart,</p>
<p>And left this head on. How should this be, Pisanio?’</p>
<p>Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre 1491 in them</p>
<p>Have laid 1492 this woe here. O, ’tis pregnant 1493 , pregnant!</p>
<p>The drug he gave me, which he said was precious</p>
<p>And cordial to me, have I not found it</p>
<p>Murd’rous to th’senses? That confirms it home 1494 :</p>
<p>This is Pisanio’s deed, and Cloten: O,</p>
<p>Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood 1495 ,</p>
<p>That we the horrider 1496 may seem to those</p>
<p>Which chance 1497 to find us! O my lord, my lord!</p>
<p>Embraces the body</p>
<p>Enter Lucius, Captains and a Soothsayer 1498</p>
<p>CAPTAIN To them the legions garrisoned in Gallia 1499</p>
<p>After 1500 your will have crossed the sea, attending 1501</p>
<p>You here at Milford Haven with your ships:</p>
<p>They are in readiness.</p>
<p>LUCIUS But what from Rome?</p>
<p>CAPTAIN The senate hath stirred up the confiners 1502</p>
<p>And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,</p>
<p>That promise noble service: and they come</p>
<p>Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,</p>
<p>Siena’s 1503 brother.</p>
<p>LUCIUS When expect you them?</p>
<p>CAPTAIN With the next benefit 1504 o’th’wind.</p>
<p>LUCIUS This forwardness 1505</p>
<p>Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers</p>
<p>Be mustered: bid the captains look to’t. Now, sir,</p>
<p>What have you dreamed of late of this war’s purpose 1506 ?</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER Last night the very gods showed me a vision —</p>
<p>I fast 1507 , and prayed for their intelligence 1508 — thus:</p>
<p>I saw Jove’s bird, the Roman eagle, winged 1509</p>
<p>From the spongy 1510 south to this part of the west,</p>
<p>There vanished in the sunbeams: which portends 1511 —</p>
<p>Unless my sins abuse my divination 1512 —</p>
<p>Success to th’Roman host 1513 .</p>
<p>LUCIUS Dream often so,</p>
<p>And never false.— Soft ho, what trunk 1514 is here?</p>
<p>Sees Cloten’s body</p>
<p>Without his 1515 top? The ruin speaks 1516 that sometime</p>
<p>It was a worthy building. How, a page?</p>
<p>Or 1517 dead or sleeping on him? But dead rather:</p>
<p>For nature doth abhor 1518 to make his bed</p>
<p>With the defunct 1519 , or sleep upon the dead.</p>
<p>Let’s see the boy’s face.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN He’s alive, my lord.</p>
<p>LUCIUS He’ll then instruct us of 1520 this body. Young one,</p>
<p>Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems</p>
<p>They crave to be demanded 1521 : who is this</p>
<p>Thou mak’st thy bloody pillow? Or who was he</p>
<p>That, otherwise than noble nature did,</p>
<p>Hath altered that good picture 1522 ? What’s thy interest</p>
<p>In this sad wreck 1523 ? How came’t? Who is 1524 ’t?</p>
<p>What art thou?</p>
<p>INNOGEN I am nothing; or if not,</p>
<p>Nothing to be were better. This was my master,</p>
<p>A very valiant Briton, and a good,</p>
<p>That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas,</p>
<p>There is no more such masters: I may wander</p>
<p>From east to occident 1525 , cry out for service 1526 ,</p>
<p>Try many, all good, serve truly, never</p>
<p>Find such another master.</p>
<p>LUCIUS ’Lack 1527 , good youth,</p>
<p>Thou mov’st no less with thy complaining 1528 than</p>
<p>Thy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend.</p>
<p>INNOGEN Richard du Champ.— If I do lie and do</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope</p>
<p>They’ll pardon it.— Say you 1529 , sir?</p>
<p>LUCIUS Thy name?</p>
<p>INNOGEN Fidele, sir.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Thou dost approve thyself the very same 1530 :</p>
<p>Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.</p>
<p>Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say</p>
<p>Thou shalt be so well mastered, but be sure</p>
<p>No less beloved. The Roman emperor’s letters,</p>
<p>Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner</p>
<p>Than thine own worth prefer 1531 thee: go with me.</p>
<p>INNOGEN I’ll follow, sir. But first, an’t 1532 please the gods,</p>
<p>I’ll hide my master from the flies, as deep</p>
<p>As these poor pickaxes 1533 can dig: and when</p>
<p>With wildwood leaves and weeds I ha’ strewed his grave,</p>
<p>And on it said a century of 1534 prayers,</p>
<p>Such as I can 1535 , twice o’er, I’ll weep and sigh,</p>
<p>And leaving so his service, follow you,</p>
<p>So please you entertain me 1536 .</p>
<p>LUCIUS Ay, good youth,</p>
<p>And rather father thee than master thee.</p>
<p>My friends,</p>
<p>The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us</p>
<p>Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,</p>
<p>And make him with our pikes 1537 and partisans 1538</p>
<p>A grave: come, arm him 1539 . Boy, he is preferred 1540</p>
<p>By thee to us, and he shall be interred</p>
<p>As soldiers can 1541 . Be cheerful, wipe thine eyes:</p>
<p>Some falls are means the happier to arise.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
