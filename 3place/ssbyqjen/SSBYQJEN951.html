<p>Enter Palamon from the bush</p>
<p>PALAMON About this hour my cousin gave his faith 907</p>
<p>To visit me again, and with him bring</p>
<p>Two swords and two good armours 908 . If he fail</p>
<p>He’s neither man nor soldier. When he left me</p>
<p>I did not think a week could have restored</p>
<p>My lost strength to me, I was grown so low</p>
<p>And crest-fall’n with my wants. I thank thee, Arcite,</p>
<p>Thou art yet a fair foe: and I feel myself,</p>
<p>With this refreshing, able once again</p>
<p>To outdure 909 danger. To delay it longer</p>
<p>Would make the world think, when it comes to hearing 910 ,</p>
<p>That I lay fatting 911 like a swine to fight</p>
<p>And not a soldier. Therefore this blest morning</p>
<p>Shall be the last, and that sword he refuses 912 ,</p>
<p>If it but hold 913 , I kill him with: ’tis justice.</p>
<p>So love and fortune for me!— O, good morrow.</p>
<p>Enter Arcite with armours and swords</p>
<p>ARCITE Good morrow, noble kinsman.</p>
<p>PALAMON I have put you</p>
<p>To too much pains, sir.</p>
<p>ARCITE That too much, fair cousin,</p>
<p>Is but a debt to honour, and my duty.</p>
<p>PALAMON Would you were so in all, sir: I could wish ye</p>
<p>As kind a kinsman as you force me find</p>
<p>A beneficial foe, that my embraces</p>
<p>Might thank ye, not my blows.</p>
<p>ARCITE I shall think either</p>
<p>Well done, a noble recompense 914 .</p>
<p>PALAMON Then I shall quit 915 you.</p>
<p>ARCITE Defy me in these fair terms, and you show 916</p>
<p>More than a mistress to me. No more anger,</p>
<p>As you love anything that’s honourable.</p>
<p>We were not bred to talk, man: when we are armed</p>
<p>And both upon our guards, then let our fury,</p>
<p>Like meeting of two tides, fly strongly from us,</p>
<p>And then to whom the birthright 917 of this beauty</p>
<p>Truly pertains 918 — without upbraidings, scorns,</p>
<p>Despisings of our persons, and such poutings</p>
<p>Fitter for girls and schoolboys — will be seen</p>
<p>And quickly, yours or mine. Wilt please you arm, sir?</p>
<p>Or, if you feel yourself not fitting 919 yet</p>
<p>And furnished with your old strength, I’ll stay 920 , cousin,</p>
<p>And ev’ry day discourse you into health,</p>
<p>As I am spared 921 . Your person I am friends with</p>
<p>And I could wish I had not said I loved her,</p>
<p>Though I had died 922 : but, loving such a lady</p>
<p>And justifying my love, I must not fly from’t.</p>
<p>PALAMON Arcite, thou art so brave an enemy</p>
<p>That no man but thy cousin’s fit to kill thee.</p>
<p>I am well and lusty 923 : Choose your arms.</p>
<p>ARCITE Choose you, sir.</p>
<p>PALAMON Wilt thou exceed 924 in all, or dost thou do it</p>
<p>To make me spare thee?</p>
<p>ARCITE If you think so, cousin,</p>
<p>You are deceived, for as I am a soldier,</p>
<p>I will not spare you.</p>
<p>PALAMON That’s well said.</p>
<p>ARCITE You’ll find it 925 .</p>
<p>PALAMON Then as I am an honest man, and love</p>
<p>With all the justice of affection,</p>
<p>I’ll pay thee soundly 926 .</p>
<p>This I’ll take.</p>
<p>Chooses armour</p>
<p>ARCITE That’s mine then.</p>
<p>Takes the other</p>
<p>I’ll arm you 927 first.</p>
<p>PALAMON Do. Pray thee</p>
<p>Arcite begins to arm him</p>
<p>tell me, cousin,</p>
<p>Where got’st thou this good armour?</p>
<p>ARCITE ’Tis the duke’s,</p>
<p>And to say true, I stole it. Do I pinch you?</p>
<p>PALAMON No.</p>
<p>ARCITE Is’t not too heavy?</p>
<p>PALAMON I have worn a lighter,</p>
<p>But I shall make it serve.</p>
<p>ARCITE I’ll buckle’t close.</p>
<p>PALAMON By any means.</p>
<p>ARCITE You care not for a grand guard 928 ?</p>
<p>PALAMON No, no, we’ll use no horses. I perceive</p>
<p>You would fain 929 be at that 930 fight.</p>
<p>ARCITE I am indifferent.</p>
<p>PALAMON Faith, so am I. Good cousin, thrust the buckle</p>
<p>Through far enough.</p>
<p>ARCITE I warrant 931 you.</p>
<p>PALAMON My casque 932 now.</p>
<p>ARCITE Will you fight bare-armed?</p>
<p>PALAMON We shall be the nimbler.</p>
<p>ARCITE But use your gauntlets though. Those are o’th’least 933 :</p>
<p>Prithee take mine, good cousin.</p>
<p>PALAMON Thank you, Arcite.</p>
<p>How do I look? Am I fall’n much away 934 ?</p>
<p>ARCITE Faith very little: love has used you kindly.</p>
<p>PALAMON I’ll warrant thee, I’ll strike home 935 .</p>
<p>ARCITE Do, and spare not.</p>
<p>I’ll give you cause, sweet cousin.</p>
<p>PALAMON Now to you, sir.</p>
<p>Begins to arm Arcite</p>
<p>Methinks this armour’s very like that, Arcite,</p>
<p>Thou wor’st that day the three kings fell, but lighter.</p>
<p>ARCITE That was a very good one, and that day</p>
<p>I well remember, you outdid me, cousin:</p>
<p>I never saw such valour: when you charged</p>
<p>Upon the left wing of the enemy,</p>
<p>I spurred hard to come up and under me</p>
<p>I had a right good horse.</p>
<p>PALAMON You had indeed:</p>
<p>A bright bay 936 , I remember.</p>
<p>ARCITE Yes, but all</p>
<p>Was vainly laboured in me: you outwent me,</p>
<p>Nor could my wishes reach you 937 . Yet a little</p>
<p>I did by imitation.</p>
<p>PALAMON More by virtue 938 .</p>
<p>You are modest, cousin.</p>
<p>ARCITE When I saw you charge first,</p>
<p>Methought I heard a dreadful clap of thunder</p>
<p>Break from the troop.</p>
<p>PALAMON But still before that flew</p>
<p>The lightning of your valour. Stay a little:</p>
<p>Is not this piece too strait 939 ?</p>
<p>ARCITE No, no, ’tis well.</p>
<p>PALAMON I would have nothing hurt thee but my sword:</p>
<p>A bruise would be dishonour.</p>
<p>ARCITE Now I am perfect 940 .</p>
<p>PALAMON Stand off then.</p>
<p>ARCITE Take my sword, I hold 941 it better.</p>
<p>PALAMON I thank ye, no: keep it, your life lies 942 on it.</p>
<p>Here’s one: if it but hold, I ask no more</p>
<p>For all my hopes. My cause and honour guard me.</p>
<p>ARCITE And me my love.</p>
<p>They bow several ways 943 , then advance and stand</p>
<p>Is there aught 944 else to say?</p>
<p>PALAMON This only, and no more: thou art mine aunt’s son</p>
<p>And that blood we desire to shed is mutual,</p>
<p>In me thine and in thee mine. My sword</p>
<p>Is in my hand and if thou killest me</p>
<p>The gods and I forgive thee. If there be</p>
<p>A place prepared for those that sleep in honour,</p>
<p>I wish his weary soul that falls may win it.</p>
<p>Fight bravely, cousin. Give me thy noble hand.</p>
<p>ARCITE Here, Palamon: this hand shall never more</p>
<p>Come near thee with such friendship.</p>
<p>PALAMON I commend 945 thee.</p>
<p>ARCITE If I fall, curse me, and say I was a coward,</p>
<p>For none but such dare die in these just trials.</p>
<p>Once more farewell, my cousin.</p>
<p>PALAMON Farewell, Arcite.</p>
<p>Fight. Horns within 946 . They stand</p>
<p>ARCITE Lo 947 , cousin, lo, our folly has undone us.</p>
<p>PALAMON Why?</p>
<p>ARCITE This is the duke, a-hunting as I told you:</p>
<p>If we be found, we are wretched. O, retire 948 ,</p>
<p>For honour’s sake, and safely presently 949</p>
<p>Into your bush again. Sir, we shall find</p>
<p>Too many hours to die in. Gentle cousin,</p>
<p>If you be seen you perish instantly</p>
<p>For breaking prison, and I, if you reveal me,</p>
<p>For my contempt 950 . Then all the world will scorn us</p>
<p>And say we had a noble difference 951 ,</p>
<p>But base disposers 952 of it.</p>
<p>PALAMON No, no, cousin,</p>
<p>I will no more be hidden, nor put off</p>
<p>This great adventure 953 to a second trial:</p>
<p>I know your cunning and I know your cause.</p>
<p>He that faints 954 now, shame take him. Put thyself</p>
<p>Upon thy present guard 955 .</p>
<p>ARCITE You are not mad?</p>
<p>PALAMON Or I will make th’advantage of this hour</p>
<p>Mine own, and what to come shall threaten me</p>
<p>I fear less than my fortune. Know, weak cousin,</p>
<p>I love Emilia and in that I’ll bury</p>
<p>Thee, and all crosses 956 else.</p>
<p>ARCITE Then come what can come.</p>
<p>Thou shalt know, Palamon, I dare as well</p>
<p>Die as discourse or sleep. Only this fears 957 me:</p>
<p>The law will have the honour of our ends.</p>
<p>Have at thy life.</p>
<p>PALAMON Look to thine own well, Arcite.</p>
<p>Fight again. Horns</p>
<p>Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, Pirithous and Train</p>
<p>THESEUS What ignorant 958 and mad malicious 959 traitors</p>
<p>Are you, that gainst the tenor of my laws</p>
<p>Are making battle, thus like knights appointed 960 ,</p>
<p>Without my leave and officers of arms 961 ?</p>
<p>By Castor 962 , both shall die!</p>
<p>PALAMON Hold 963 thy word, Theseus.</p>
<p>We are certainly both traitors, both despisers</p>
<p>Of thee and of thy goodness: I am Palamon</p>
<p>That cannot love thee, he that broke thy prison:</p>
<p>Think well what that deserves. And this is Arcite:</p>
<p>A bolder traitor never trod thy ground,</p>
<p>A falser ne’er seemed friend. This is the man</p>
<p>Was begged 964 and banished, this is he contemns 965 thee</p>
<p>And what thou dar’st do; and in this disguise</p>
<p>Against thine own edict follows 966 thy sister,</p>
<p>That fortunate bright star, the fair Emilia,</p>
<p>Whose servant — if there be a right in seeing</p>
<p>And first bequeathing of the soul to — justly</p>
<p>I am, and which is more, dares think her his.</p>
<p>This treachery, like a most trusty lover,</p>
<p>I called him now to answer. If thou be’st</p>
<p>As thou art spoken 967 , great and virtuous,</p>
<p>The true decider of all injuries,</p>
<p>Say, ‘Fight again’ and thou shalt see me, Theseus,</p>
<p>Do such a justice thou thy self wilt envy.</p>
<p>Then take my life, I’ll woo 968 thee to’t.</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS O heaven,</p>
<p>What more than man is this!</p>
<p>THESEUS I have sworn.</p>
<p>ARCITE We seek not</p>
<p>Thy breath of mercy, Theseus: ’tis to me</p>
<p>A thing as soon to die as thee to say it</p>
<p>And no more moved 969 . Where 970 this man calls me traitor,</p>
<p>Let me say thus much: if in love be treason,</p>
<p>In service of so excellent a beauty,</p>
<p>As I love most, and in that faith will perish,</p>
<p>As I have brought my life here to confirm it,</p>
<p>As I have served her truest, worthiest,</p>
<p>As I dare kill this cousin that denies it,</p>
<p>So let me be most traitor and ye please me.</p>
<p>For 971 scorning thy edict, duke, ask that lady</p>
<p>Why she is fair, and why her eyes command me</p>
<p>Stay here to love her: and if she say ‘Traitor’,</p>
<p>I am a villain fit to lie unburied.</p>
<p>PALAMON Thou shalt have pity of us both, O Theseus,</p>
<p>If unto neither thou show mercy. Stop 972 ,</p>
<p>As thou art just, thy noble ear against us:</p>
<p>As thou art valiant, for thy cousin’s soul</p>
<p>Whose twelve strong labours crown his memory 973 ,</p>
<p>Let’s die together at one instant, duke.</p>
<p>Only a little let him fall before me,</p>
<p>That I may tell my soul he shall not have her.</p>
<p>THESEUS I grant your wish, for to say true, your cousin</p>
<p>Has ten times more offended, for I gave him</p>
<p>More mercy than you found, sir, your offences</p>
<p>Being no more than his. None here speak for ’em,</p>
<p>For ere the sun set, both shall sleep for ever.</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA Alas the pity!</p>
<p>Now or never, sister,</p>
<p>To Emilia</p>
<p>Speak not to be denied 974 . That face of yours</p>
<p>Will bear the curses else of after ages</p>
<p>For these lost cousins.</p>
<p>EMILIA In my face, dear sister,</p>
<p>I find no anger to ’em, nor no ruin:</p>
<p>The misadventure of their own eyes kill 975 ’em.</p>
<p>Yet 976 that I will be woman, and have pity,</p>
<p>My knees shall grow to 977 th’ground but 978 I’ll get mercy.</p>
<p>Help me, dear sister, in a deed so virtuous,</p>
<p>The powers of all women will be with us.—</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>Most royal brother—</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA Sir, by our tie of marriage—</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>EMILIA By your own spotless honour—</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA By that faith,</p>
<p>That fair hand and that honest heart you gave me—</p>
<p>EMILIA By that you would have 979 pity in another,</p>
<p>By your own virtues infinite—</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA By valour,</p>
<p>By all the chaste 980 nights I have ever pleased you—</p>
<p>THESEUS These are strange conjurings 981 .</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS Nay then I’ll in too:</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>By all our friendship, sir, by all our dangers,</p>
<p>By all you love most: wars, and this sweet lady—</p>
<p>EMILIA By that you would have trembled to deny</p>
<p>A blushing maid 982 —</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA By your own eyes, by strength,</p>
<p>In which you swore I went beyond all women,</p>
<p>Almost all men, and yet I yielded, Theseus—</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS To crown all this, by your most noble soul,</p>
<p>Which cannot want 983 due mercy, I beg first—</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA Next hear my prayers—</p>
<p>EMILIA Last let me entreat, sir—</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS For mercy.</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA Mercy!</p>
<p>EMILIA Mercy on these princes!</p>
<p>THESEUS Ye make my faith reel 984 . Say I felt</p>
<p>Emilia, Hippolyta and Pirithous rise</p>
<p>Compassion to ’em both, how would you place it 985 ?</p>
<p>EMILIA Upon their lives: but with their banishments.</p>
<p>THESEUS You are a right 986 woman, sister: you have pity,</p>
<p>But want the understanding where to use it.</p>
<p>If you desire their lives, invent a way</p>
<p>Safer than banishment. Can these two live</p>
<p>And have the agony of love about ’em</p>
<p>And not kill one another? Every day</p>
<p>They’d fight about you: hourly bring your honour</p>
<p>In public question 987 with their swords. Be wise then</p>
<p>And here forget ’em. It concerns your credit 988</p>
<p>And my oath equally. I have said they die.</p>
<p>Better they fall by th’law than one another.</p>
<p>Bow 989 not my honour.</p>
<p>EMILIA O my noble brother,</p>
<p>That oath was rashly made, and in your anger.</p>
<p>Your reason will not hold 990 it: if such vows</p>
<p>Stand for express will 991 , all the world must perish.</p>
<p>Beside, I have another oath gainst yours</p>
<p>Of more authority, I am sure more love,</p>
<p>Not made in passion 992 neither, but good heed 993 .</p>
<p>THESEUS What is it, sister?</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS Urge it home, brave lady.</p>
<p>EMILIA That you would nev’r deny me anything</p>
<p>Fit for my modest suit and your free granting.</p>
<p>I tie you to your word now: if ye fail in’t,</p>
<p>Think how you maim 994 your honour —</p>
<p>For now I am set a-begging, sir, I am deaf</p>
<p>To all but your compassion — how their lives</p>
<p>Might breed the ruin of my name. Opinion!</p>
<p>Shall anything that loves me perish for me?</p>
<p>That were a cruel wisdom. Do men prune</p>
<p>The straight young boughs that blush with thousand blossoms</p>
<p>Because they may be 995 rotten? O Duke Theseus,</p>
<p>The goodly mothers that have groaned 996 for these</p>
<p>And all the longing maids that ever loved,</p>
<p>If your vow stand, shall curse me and my beauty</p>
<p>And in their funeral songs for these two cousins</p>
<p>Despise my cruelty and cry ‘Woe worth 997 me’,</p>
<p>Till I am nothing but the scorn of women.</p>
<p>For heaven’s sake save their lives and banish ’em.</p>
<p>THESEUS On what conditions?</p>
<p>EMILIA Swear ’em never more</p>
<p>To make me their contention 998 , or to know 999 me,</p>
<p>To tread upon thy dukedom, and to be,</p>
<p>Wherever they shall travel, ever strangers</p>
<p>To one another.</p>
<p>PALAMON I’ll be cut a-pieces</p>
<p>Before I take this oath! Forget I love her?</p>
<p>O, all ye gods, despise me then! Thy banishment</p>
<p>I not mislike, so we may fairly carry</p>
<p>Our swords and cause along, else never trifle</p>
<p>But take our lives, duke. I must love and will,</p>
<p>And for that love, must and dare kill this cousin</p>
<p>On any piece 1000 the earth has.</p>
<p>THESEUS Will you, Arcite,</p>
<p>Take these conditions?</p>
<p>PALAMON He’s a villain then.</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS These are men!</p>
<p>ARCITE No,never, duke: ’tis worse to me than begging</p>
<p>To take my life so basely 1001 . Though I think</p>
<p>I never shall enjoy her, yet I’ll preserve</p>
<p>The honour of affection and die for her,</p>
<p>Make death a devil 1002 .</p>
<p>THESEUS What may be done? For now I feel compassion.</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS Let it not fall again, sir.</p>
<p>THESEUS Say, Emilia,</p>
<p>If one of them were dead, as one must 1003 , are you</p>
<p>Content to 1004 take th’other to your husband?</p>
<p>They cannot both enjoy you. They are princes</p>
<p>As goodly as your own eyes and as noble</p>
<p>As ever fame yet spoke of. Look upon ’em</p>
<p>And if you can love, end this difference.</p>
<p>I give consent. Are you content too, princes?</p>
<p>BOTH With all our souls.</p>
<p>THESEUS He that she refuses</p>
<p>Must die then.</p>
<p>BOTH Any death thou canst invent, duke.</p>
<p>PALAMON If I fall from that mouth 1005 , I fall with favour</p>
<p>And lovers yet unborn shall bless my ashes.</p>
<p>ARCITE If she refuse me, yet my grave will wed me</p>
<p>And soldiers sing my epitaph.</p>
<p>THESEUS Make choice, then.</p>
<p>To Emilia</p>
<p>EMILIA I cannot, sir, they are both too excellent:</p>
<p>For 1006 me, a hair shall never fall of 1007 these men.</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA What will become of ’em?</p>
<p>THESEUS Thus I ordain it</p>
<p>And by mine honour, once again it stands,</p>
<p>Or both shall die. You shall both to your country</p>
<p>And each within this month accompanied</p>
<p>With three fair knights, appear again in this place,</p>
<p>In which I’ll plant a pyramid 1008 : and whether 1009</p>
<p>Before us that are here, can force his cousin</p>
<p>By fair and knightly strength to touch the pillar,</p>
<p>He shall enjoy her: the other lose his head,</p>
<p>And all his friends. Nor shall he grudge to fall 1010 ,</p>
<p>Nor think he dies with interest in 1011 this lady.</p>
<p>Will this content ye?</p>
<p>PALAMON Yes. Here, cousin Arcite,</p>
<p>Offers his hand to Arcite</p>
<p>I am friends again, till that hour.</p>
<p>ARCITE I embrace ye.</p>
<p>Embraces him</p>
<p>THESEUS Are you content, sister?</p>
<p>EMILIA Yes, I must 1012 , sir,</p>
<p>Else both miscarry 1013 .</p>
<p>THESEUS Come shake hands again then,</p>
<p>And take heed, as you are gentlemen, this quarrel</p>
<p>Sleep till the hour prefixed, and hold your course 1014 .</p>
<p>PALAMON We dare not fail thee, Theseus.</p>
<p>Palamon and Arcite shake hands</p>
<p>THESEUS Come, I’ll give ye</p>
<p>Now usage 1015 like to princes and to friends.</p>
<p>When ye return, who wins, I’ll settle here 1016 :</p>
<p>Who loses, yet I’ll weep upon his bier 1017 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
