<h4 id="introduction-to-much-ado-about-nothing">Introduction to Much Ado
About Nothing</h4>
<p>Comedy is tragedy averted. A young woman prepares herself for
marriage. Then we witness the ceremony itself. Whenever we go to a
wedding we cannot help relishing the dramatic pause when the priest asks
the couple, ‘If either of you know any inward impediment why you should
not be conjoined, I charge you on your souls to utter it.’ On this
occasion the drama turns into a crisis: in front of the whole
congregation Claudio the groom accuses Hero the bride of infidelity on
the very eve of her wedding day. She faints, he storms out, her father
says that he hopes she is dead since she has brought such shame on his
household. The play has begun with the end of a war, a move from the
language of martial bonding to that of courtship and coupling. Its
atmosphere has been all holiday. No more.</p>
<p>The change of mood extends even to the other pair of lovers. The
relationship between Benedick and Beatrice has hitherto been
characterized by sharp but always light-hearted banter; now Beatrice
raises the stakes dramatically, forcing Benedick to choose between love
and friendship. Suddenly we have moved into the Othello -world of sexual
accusation and death-threat. Don John, the chief plotter of all the
mischief, is no Iago – he is a cardboard cut-out villain, an archetypal
melancholy man (‘I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have
cause, and smile at no man’s jests’) – so in our rational minds we do
not believe he will triumph, but we end the fourth act feeling that a
substantial act of atonement will be required of Claudio.</p>
<p>Comedy makes room for little acts of grace; it allows the second
chance which tragedy denies. In Much Ado, the grace comes from two
agencies: the Friar who arranges the mock-death and resurrection of Hero
(‘let wonder seem familiar’), and the Watchmen who stumble upon the
truth of Don John’s plot. We expect God to work his benign way through
friars: this one teaches the important lesson that ‘what we have we
prize not to the worth / Whiles we enjoy it.’ It is only when we have
lost someone that we realize how much we value them. It may seem strange
that providence also works by means of the bumbling, malaprop-prone
Dogberry. It is, however, one of the laws of the comic universe that
appearance (‘semblance’) is deceptive. Those who think they are clever,
like Don John, end up looking foolish; those whom we at first think are
foolish, like Dogberry, turn out to be peculiarly wise. Their wisdom is
that of the heart, not the intellect. Jesus said that to understand the
kingdom of heaven one has to make oneself as a child: Dogberry, like
Bottom in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, is one of Shakespeare’s natural
children. He is ‘condemned into everlasting redemption’ for his
simplicity and goodness.</p>
<p>In the final act, Claudio goes through his penance at the tomb of
Hero. Then in the final scene he does as he is told and is rewarded via
a theatrical flourish that substitutes the former bride for a supposed
replacement one, a device in the tradition of Euripides’ ancient and
beautiful play Alcestis . But in agreeing to marry the mysterious cousin
has not Claudio been a little eager to forget his first love? He is not
exactly gracious when she comes back to him – the only words he manages
are a startled ‘Another Hero!’ There is no word of apology or plea for
forgiveness, only a hurrying forward to the resolution of the Beatrice
and Benedick plot. In Christopher Marlowe’s famous poem, which
Shakespeare knew well, Leander swims the Hellespont and gladly risks
drowning in order to reach his beloved Hero. Claudio does not seem to be
the kind of lover who would make such a gesture: the truly romantic,
potentially tragic, action is Beatrice’s demand of Benedick that he
should prove his love for her by killing Claudio.</p>
<p>As spectators, we have been much more attracted to the witty lovers
than the (supposedly) romantic ones. Since we cannot wait for the union
of Benedick and Beatrice, we join Claudio in the rush towards it. Only
on a second reading or viewing do we stop to worry about the kind of
husband he will make for Hero. The question that matters to us is how on
earth Beatrice and Benedick will stop insulting each other long enough
to agree to a marriage contract. The answer comes from Leonato when he
says ‘Peace, I will stop your mouth’ – and forces the lovers to kiss. We
know that the witcombat will resume, but for a moment at the end of the
play we imagine the suspension of all quarrels in a kiss and then a
dance. Technically, the Beatrice and Benedick story is a sub-plot that
Shakespeare introduced into a romance story he inherited from
Renaissance Italy; theatrically, they steal the show and the benign plot
whereby they are tricked into acknowledging their love for each other is
the most memorable thing in the play. The simultaneously ardent and
reluctant conjunction of ‘Signior Mountanto’ and ‘Lady Disdain’ helps us
to forget about Claudio’s deficiencies. Small wonder that King Charles I
wrote ‘Bennedike and Betrice’ beneath the title of the play in his copy
of Shakespeare’s Second Folio and that in the nineteenth century Hector
Berlioz dispensed with the other pair altogether in composing his opera
Béatrice et Bénédict.</p>
<p>The play’s title is multiply suggestive. There is much ado about the
nothing that Hero has done wrong. Shakespeare often makes ‘nothing’ a
euphemism for a vagina, because women lack a male ‘thing’ between their
legs, so there is an obscene second sense. ‘Nothing’ seems to have been
pronounced ‘noting’, which provides a further rich sense: the play is
full of ‘noting’ in the sense of watching and overhearing, whether in
the famous scenes in which Benedick and Beatrice are deliberately
allowed to overhear conversations of great interest to them or the plan
to let Claudio ‘witness’ the infidelity of his betrothed.</p>
<p>Disguise is a closely related motif: Don Pedro woos Hero on behalf
of, and in the guise of, Claudio. This plan is eavesdropped upon by
scheming Borachio. In each narrative of noting, an imagined detail –
interlaced branches in a garden walk, a musty room hung with tapestry –
creates a sense of location even as Shakespeare writes for a bare stage.
As befits a work in which prose outweighs verse by a ratio of more than
two to one, the texture of the play offers far more realism than
romance: instead of the (sometimes parodically overblown) love poetry we
find in many of the other comedies, the focus here is on less hyperbolic
but more heartfelt matters such as a bride’s delight in the precise
fashion and cut of her wedding dress.</p>
<p>Though Don Pedro facilitates Claudio’s desire for Hero, it is
Beatrice who intrigues him. When he offers to repeat his matchmaking and
get her a husband, for a moment he is half-serious in offering her
himself. The exchange is one of the loveliest moments anywhere in
Shakespearean comedy. Beatrice bookends their encounter with references
to the pair who have found love; her merriment in the interim masks a
profound loneliness that Don Pedro himself retains at the end of the
play. ‘Prince, thou art sad,’ says Benedick, ‘get thee a wife, get thee
a wife.’ Everyone needs to join the dance of matrimony, he suggests –
otherwise one will end up a despised exile like Don John. But the note
of realism that comes from the grounded prose voice of the sparring
partners is sounded one last time, in a light-hearted reference to
cuckoldry that simultaneously reactivates and defuses the matter of
infidelity that has created all the ado: ‘There is no staff more
reverend than one tipped with horn.’</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: The war is over. Pedro Prince of Aragon, with his followers
Benedick and Claudio, visits Leonato, Duke of Messina, father of Hero
and uncle of Beatrice. Claudio falls in love with Hero and their
marriage is agreed upon. Beatrice and Benedick despise love and engage
in comic banter. The others plot to make them fall in love with each
other, by a trick in which Benedick will overhear his friends talking of
Beatrice’s supposed secret love for him, and vice versa. Meanwhile Don
John, the prince’s misanthropic illegitimate brother, contrives a more
malicious plot with the assistance of his follower Borachio: Claudio is
led to believe that he has witnessed Hero in a compromising situation on
the night before her wedding day – in fact it is her maid Margaret with
Borachio. Claudio denounces Hero during the marriage ceremony. She
faints and on the advice of the Friar, who is convinced of her
innocence, Leonato announces that she is dead. Beatrice demands that
Benedick should kill Claudio. The foolish constable Dogberry and his
watchmen overhear Borachio boasting of his exploit and the plot is
exposed. Claudio promises to make amends to Leonato: he is required to
marry a cousin of Hero’s in her place. When unmasked, she is revealed as
Hero. Beatrice agrees to marry Benedick.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Benedick (17%/134/8), Leonato (13%/120/9), Don Pedro
(12%/135/8), Claudio (11%/125/8), Beatrice (10%/106/8), Dogberry
(7%/52/4), Hero (5%/44/6), Borachio (5%/23/6), Don John (4%/40/6), Friar
Francis (3%/16/2), Margaret (2%/26/3), Antonio (2%/23/4), Ursula
(2%/19/3), Conrad (1%/23/1), Verges (1%/18/3), Balthasar (1%/11/2).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 30% verse, 70% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: Late 1598. Not mentioned by Francis Meres in list of
Shakespeare’s plays in Palladis Tamis (registered for publication
September 1598), but included part for Will Kemp, who left Shakespeare’s
acting company in early 1599.</p>
<p>SOURCES: The Hero/Claudio plot of a deception leading to a false
supposition of infidelity has many precedents in the sixteenth-century
Italian romance tradition; Shakespeare’s primary sources seem to have
been (1) the tale of Sir Timbreo and Fenicia in Matteo Bandello’s
Novelle, which included characters of Piero King of Aragon and Lionato
of Messina (in Italian, 1554, no English translation, but Shakespeare
might have known the French translation of Pierre de Belleforest,
Histoires Tragiques, 1569), and (2) the tale of Renaldo and Ginevra in
Ariosto’s Orlando Furioso, book 5 (English translation by Sir John
Harington, 1591). The Beatrice and Benedick plot is Shakespeare’s
innovation, though witty couples and characters who scorn love only to
fall in love themselves have comic precedents, notably in the plays of
John Lyly.</p>
<p>TEXT: Quarto published 1600, probably printed from Shakespeare’s
manuscript or a transcript of it. Generally good quality of printing. On
some occasions, actors’ names instead of characters’ appear in the
speech headings (Kemp for Dogberry and Cowley for Verges). Folio printed
from Quarto, though with some reference to a playhouse manuscript; extra
stage directions inserted, also act divisions; some corrections and some
errors introduced. Our text restores Quarto readings in cases judged to
be compositor error, but retains Folio where changes appear to be
intentional.</p>
