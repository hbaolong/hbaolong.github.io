<h4 id="scene-4-running-scene-16">Scene 4 ／ running scene 16</h4>
<p>Enter Leonato, Benedick, [Beatrice, ] Margaret, Ursula, old man
[Antonio ], Friar [Francis and ] Hero</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS Did I not tell you she was innocent?</p>
<p>LEONATO So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her</p>
<p>Upon 1073 the error that you heard debated 1074 .</p>
<p>But Margaret was in some fault for this,</p>
<p>Although against her will 1075 , as it appears</p>
<p>In the true course of all the question 1076 .</p>
<p>ANTONIO Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.</p>
<p>BENEDICK And so am I, being else 1077 by faith 1078 enforced</p>
<p>To call young Claudio to a reckoning 1079 for it.</p>
<p>LEONATO Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all,</p>
<p>Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,</p>
<p>And when I send for you, come hither masked.</p>
<p>The prince and Claudio promised by this hour</p>
<p>To visit me. You know your office, brother:</p>
<p>You must be father to your brother’s daughter,</p>
<p>And give her to young Claudio.</p>
<p>Exeunt Ladies</p>
<p>ANTONIO Which I will do with confirmed countenance 1080 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS To do what, signior?</p>
<p>BENEDICK To bind me, or undo 1081 me — one of them.</p>
<p>Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,</p>
<p>Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.</p>
<p>LEONATO That eye my daughter lent her: ’tis most true.</p>
<p>BENEDICK And I do with an eye of love requite her.</p>
<p>LEONATO The sight whereof I think you had from me,</p>
<p>From Claudio and the prince: but what’s your will?</p>
<p>BENEDICK Your answer, sir, is enigmatical.</p>
<p>But for 1082 my will, my will is 1083 your good will</p>
<p>May stand with ours, this day to be conjoined</p>
<p>In the state of honourable marriage,</p>
<p>In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.</p>
<p>LEONATO My heart is with your liking.</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS And my help.</p>
<p>Enter Prince [Don Pedro ] and Claudio, with Attendants</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Good morrow to this fair assembly.</p>
<p>LEONATO Good morrow, prince, good morrow, Claudio:</p>
<p>We here attend you. Are you yet determined</p>
<p>Today to marry with my brother’s daughter?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO I’ll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope 1084 .</p>
<p>LEONATO Call her forth, brother: here’s the friar ready.</p>
<p>[Exit Antonio ]</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what’s the matter,</p>
<p>That you have such a February face,</p>
<p>So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO I think he thinks upon the savage bull.</p>
<p>Tush, fear not, man: we’ll tip thy horns with gold,</p>
<p>And all Europa 1085 shall rejoice at thee,</p>
<p>As once Europa did at lusty Jove,</p>
<p>When he would play the noble beast in love 1086 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low,</p>
<p>And some such strange bull leaped your father’s cow,</p>
<p>And got a calf in that same noble feat</p>
<p>Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.</p>
<p>Enter brother [Antonio ], Hero, Beatrice, Margaret, [and ] Ursula
[the ladies all masked ]</p>
<p>CLAUDIO For this I owe you 1087 : here comes other reck’nings.</p>
<p>Which is the lady I must seize upon?</p>
<p>ANTONIO This same is she, and I do give you her.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Why, then she’s mine. Sweet, let me see your face.</p>
<p>LEONATO No, that you shall not, till you take her hand</p>
<p>Before this friar and swear to marry her.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Give me your hand before this holy friar.</p>
<p>I am your husband, if you like of me.</p>
<p>HERO And when I lived, I was your other wife:</p>
<p>And when you loved, you were my other husband.</p>
<p>Unmasks</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Another Hero?</p>
<p>HERO Nothing certainer.</p>
<p>One Hero died defiled, but I do live,</p>
<p>And surely as I live, I am a maid.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO The former Hero! Hero that is dead!</p>
<p>LEONATO She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS All this amazement can I qualify 1088 ,</p>
<p>When after that the holy rites are ended,</p>
<p>I’ll tell you largely 1089 of fair Hero’s death.</p>
<p>Meantime let wonder seem familiar,</p>
<p>And to the chapel let us presently.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Soft and fair 1090 , friar. Which is Beatrice?</p>
<p>BEATRICE I answer to that name. What is your will?</p>
<p>Unmasks</p>
<p>BENEDICK Do not you love me?</p>
<p>BEATRICE Why, no, no more than reason.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Why then, your uncle, and the prince, and Claudio</p>
<p>Have been deceived: they swore you did.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Do not you love me?</p>
<p>BENEDICK Troth, no, no more than reason.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Why then, my cousin 1091 , Margaret and Ursula</p>
<p>Are much deceived, for they did swear you did.</p>
<p>BENEDICK They swore you were almost sick for me.</p>
<p>BEATRICE They swore you were well-nigh dead for me.</p>
<p>BENEDICK ’Tis no matter. Then you do not love me?</p>
<p>BEATRICE No, truly, but in friendly recompense.</p>
<p>LEONATO Come, cousin 1092 , I am sure you love the gentleman.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO And I’ll be sworn upon’t that he loves her,</p>
<p>For here’s a paper written in his hand,</p>
<p>Shows a paper</p>
<p>A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,</p>
<p>Fashioned to Beatrice.</p>
<p>HERO And here’s another</p>
<p>Shows another paper</p>
<p>Writ in my cousin’s hand, stolen from her pocket,</p>
<p>Containing her affection unto Benedick.</p>
<p>BENEDICK A miracle! Here’s our own hands against our hearts. Come, I
will have thee, but by this light I take thee for pity.</p>
<p>BEATRICE I would not deny you, but by this good day I yield upon
great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were
in a consumption 1093 .</p>
<p>LEONATO Peace! I will stop your mouth.</p>
<p>Makes Beatrice and Benedick kiss</p>
<p>DON PEDRO How dost thou, ‘Benedick, the married man’?</p>
<p>BENEDICK I’ll tell thee what, prince: a college 1094 of wit-crackers
cannot flout 1095 me out of my humour. Dost thou think I care for a
satire or an epigram? No. If a man will be beaten with brains, a shall
wear nothing handsome about him 1096 . In brief, since I do purpose to
marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say
against it, and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against
it, for man is a giddy 1097 thing, and this is my conclusion. For thy
part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee, but in that thou art
like 1098 to be my kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I
might have cudgelled 1099 thee out of thy single life to make thee a
double-dealer 1100 , which out of question thou wilt be, if my cousin do
not look exceeding narrowly to thee.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Come, come, we are friends. Let’s have a dance ere we are
married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives’ heels 1101
.</p>
<p>LEONATO We’ll have dancing afterward.</p>
<p>BENEDICK First, of my word: therefore play, music. Prince, thou art
sad 1102 : get thee a wife, get thee a wife. There is no staff more
reverend than one tipped with horn 1103 .</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER My lord, your brother John is ta’en in flight,</p>
<p>And brought with armèd men back to Messina.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Think not on him till tomorrow.</p>
<p>I’ll devise thee brave 1104 punishments for him.</p>
<p>Strike up, pipers!</p>
