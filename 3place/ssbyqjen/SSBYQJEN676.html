10</h4>
<p>Drums. Flourish and colours 693 . Enter Richard, Aumerle, Carlisle
and Soldiers</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Barkloughly Castle 694 call you this at hand?</p>
<p>AUMERLE Yea, my lord. How brooks 695 your grace the air,</p>
<p>After your late tossing on the breaking seas?</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy</p>
<p>To stand upon my kingdom once again.</p>
<p>Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,</p>
<p>Though rebels wound thee with their horses’ hoofs.</p>
<p>As a long-parted mother with her child</p>
<p>Plays fondly 696 with her tears and smiles in meeting,</p>
<p>So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,</p>
<p>And do thee favour with my royal hands.</p>
<p>Feed not thy sovereign’s foe, my gentle earth,</p>
<p>Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense 697 ,</p>
<p>But let thy spiders 698 , that suck up thy venom,</p>
<p>And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,</p>
<p>Doing annoyance 699 to the treacherous feet</p>
<p>Which with usurping steps do trample thee.</p>
<p>Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;</p>
<p>And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,</p>
<p>Guard 700 it, I prithee 701 , with a lurking adder</p>
<p>Whose double 702 tongue may with a mortal 703 touch</p>
<p>Throw death upon thy sovereign’s enemies.</p>
<p>Mock not my senseless conjuration 704 , lords:</p>
<p>This earth shall have a feeling and these stones</p>
<p>Prove armèd soldiers, ere her native 705 king</p>
<p>Shall falter under foul rebellion’s arms.</p>
<p>CARLISLE Fear not, my lord. That power that made you king</p>
<p>Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.</p>
<p>AUMERLE He means, my lord, that we are too remiss,</p>
<p>Whilst Bullingbrook, through our security 706 ,</p>
<p>Grows strong and great in substance and in friends.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Discomfortable 707 cousin! Know’st thou not</p>
<p>That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,</p>
<p>Behind the globe that lights the lower world 708 ,</p>
<p>Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen</p>
<p>In murders and in outrage bloody here:</p>
<p>But when from under this terrestrial ball</p>
<p>He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines</p>
<p>And darts his lightning through ev’ry guilty hole,</p>
<p>Then murders, treasons and detested sins ——</p>
<p>The cloak of night being plucked from off their backs ——</p>
<p>Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?</p>
<p>So when this thief, this traitor, Bullingbrook,</p>
<p>Who all this while hath revelled in the night,</p>
<p>Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,</p>
<p>His treasons will sit blushing in his face,</p>
<p>Not able to endure the sight of day,</p>
<p>But, self-affrighted, tremble at his sin.</p>
<p>Not all the water in the rough rude 709 sea</p>
<p>Can wash the balm 710 from an anointed king;</p>
<p>The breath of worldly men cannot depose</p>
<p>The deputy elected by the Lord.</p>
<p>For every man that Bullingbrook hath pressed 711</p>
<p>To lift shrewd 712 steel 713 against our golden crown,</p>
<p>Heaven for his Richard hath in heavenly pay</p>
<p>A glorious angel 714 . Then, if angels fight,</p>
<p>Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.</p>
<p>Enter Salisbury</p>
<p>Welcome, my lord. How far off lies your power?</p>
<p>SALISBURY Nor near 715 nor farther off, my gracious lord,</p>
<p>Than this weak arm. Discomfort 716 guides my tongue</p>
<p>And bids me speak of nothing but despair.</p>
<p>One day too late, I fear, my noble lord,</p>
<p>Hath clouded all thy happy 717 days on earth.</p>
<p>O, call back yesterday, bid time return,</p>
<p>And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!</p>
<p>Today, today, unhappy day too late,</p>
<p>O’erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state 718 ;</p>
<p>For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead,</p>
<p>Are gone to Bullingbrook, dispersed and fled.</p>
<p>AUMERLE Comfort, my liege. Why looks your grace so pale?</p>
<p>KING RICHARD But now 719 the blood of twenty thousand men</p>
<p>Did triumph 720 in my face, and they are fled.</p>
<p>And till so much blood thither come again,</p>
<p>Have I not reason to look pale and dead?</p>
<p>All souls that will be safe fly from my side,</p>
<p>For time hath set a blot upon my pride.</p>
<p>AUMERLE Comfort, my liege. Remember who you are.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD I had forgot myself. Am I not king?</p>
<p>Awake, thou sluggard majesty, thou sleepest.</p>
<p>Is not the king’s name forty thousand names?</p>
<p>Arm, arm, my name! A puny subject strikes</p>
<p>At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,</p>
<p>Ye favourites of a king. Are we not high 721 ?</p>
<p>High be our thoughts. I know my uncle York</p>
<p>Hath power enough to serve our turn 722 . But who comes here?</p>
<p>Enter Scroop</p>
<p>SCROOP More health and happiness betide 723 my liege</p>
<p>Than can my care-tuned 724 tongue deliver 725 him!</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Mine ear is open and my heart prepared.</p>
<p>The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.</p>
<p>Say, is my kingdom lost? Why, ’twas my care 726 ,</p>
<p>And what loss is it to be rid of care?</p>
<p>Strives Bullingbrook to be as great as we?</p>
<p>Greater he shall not be. If he serve God,</p>
<p>We’ll serve him too and be his fellow 727 so.</p>
<p>Revolt our subjects? That we cannot mend 728 .</p>
<p>They break their faith to God as well as us.</p>
<p>Cry woe, destruction, ruin, loss, decay.</p>
<p>The worst is death, and death will have his 729 day.</p>
<p>SCROOP Glad am I that your highness is so armed</p>
<p>To bear the tidings of calamity.</p>
<p>Like an unseasonable stormy day,</p>
<p>Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,</p>
<p>As if the world were all dissolved to tears,</p>
<p>So high above his limits swells the rage</p>
<p>Of Bullingbrook 730 , covering your fearful 731 land</p>
<p>With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.</p>
<p>Whitebeards 732 have armed their thin and hairless scalps</p>
<p>Against thy majesty, and boys with women’s voices</p>
<p>Strive to speak big 733 and clap 734 their female 735 joints</p>
<p>In stiff unwieldy arms 736 against thy crown.</p>
<p>Thy very beadsmen 737 learn to bend their bows</p>
<p>Of double-fatal 738 yew against thy state.</p>
<p>Yea, distaff-women 739 manage rusty bills 740</p>
<p>Against thy seat 741 . Both young and old rebel,</p>
<p>And all goes worse than I have power to tell.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Too well, too well thou tell’st a tale so ill.</p>
<p>Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot?</p>
<p>What is become of Bushy, where is Green,</p>
<p>That they have let the dangerous enemy</p>
<p>Measure our confines 742 with such peaceful 743 steps?</p>
<p>If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it.</p>
<p>I warrant 744 they have made peace with Bullingbrook.</p>
<p>SCROOP Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD O, villains, vipers, damned without redemption!</p>
<p>Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!</p>
<p>Snakes, in my heart-blood warmed, that sting my heart!</p>
<p>Three Judas 745 es, each one thrice worse than Judas!</p>
<p>Would they make peace? Terrible hell make war</p>
<p>Upon their spotted 746 souls for this offence!</p>
<p>SCROOP Sweet love, I see, changing his property 747 ,</p>
<p>Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.</p>
<p>Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made</p>
<p>With heads, and not with hands 748 : those whom you curse</p>
<p>Have felt the worst of death’s destroying hand</p>
<p>And lie full low, graved 749 in the hollow ground.</p>
<p>AUMERLE Is Bushy, Green and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?</p>
<p>SCROOP Yea, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.</p>
<p>AUMERLE Where is the duke my father with his power?</p>
<p>KING RICHARD No matter where; of comfort no man speak.</p>
<p>Let’s talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs,</p>
<p>Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes</p>
<p>Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth.</p>
<p>Let’s choose executors and talk of wills.</p>
<p>And yet not so; for what can we bequeath</p>
<p>Save our deposèd bodies to the ground?</p>
<p>Our lands, our lives and all are Bullingbrook’s,</p>
<p>And nothing can we call our own but death</p>
<p>And that small model 750 of the barren earth</p>
<p>Which serves as paste and cover 751 to our bones.</p>
<p>For heaven’s sake let us sit upon the ground</p>
<p>And tell sad 752 stories 753 of the death of kings:</p>
<p>How some have been deposed, some slain in war,</p>
<p>Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed,</p>
<p>Some poisoned by their wives, some sleeping killed,</p>
<p>All murdered. For within the hollow crown</p>
<p>That rounds 754 the mortal 755 temples of a king</p>
<p>Keeps Death his court and there the antic 756 sits,</p>
<p>Scoffing his state 757 and grinning at his pomp,</p>
<p>Allowing him a breath, a little scene,</p>
<p>To monarchize 758 , be feared and kill with looks,</p>
<p>Infusing him with self 759 and vain conceit 760 ,</p>
<p>As if this flesh which walls about our life,</p>
<p>Were brass impregnable. And humoured thus 761 ,</p>
<p>Comes at the last and with a little pin</p>
<p>Bores through his castle walls, and farewell king!</p>
<p>Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood</p>
<p>With solemn reverence. Throw away respect,</p>
<p>Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,</p>
<p>For you have but mistook me all this while:</p>
<p>I live with bread like you, feel want,</p>
<p>Taste grief, need friends. Subjected 762 thus,</p>
<p>How can you say to me, I am a king?</p>
<p>CARLISLE My lord, wise men ne’er wail their present woes,</p>
<p>But presently 763 prevent the ways to wail 764 .</p>
<p>To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,</p>
<p>Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,</p>
<p>And so your follies fight against yourself 765 .</p>
<p>Fear and be slain. No worse can come to fight 766 .</p>
<p>And fight and die is death destroying death 767 ,</p>
<p>Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.</p>
<p>AUMERLE My father hath a power. Enquire of him</p>
<p>And learn to make a body of a limb 768 .</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Thou chid’st 769 me well. Proud Bullingbrook, I come</p>
<p>To change 770 blows with thee for our day of doom 771 :</p>
<p>This ague 772 fit of fear is over-blown 773 ,</p>
<p>An easy task it is to win our own.</p>
<p>Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?</p>
<p>Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.</p>
<p>SCROOP Men judge by the complexion of the sky</p>
<p>The state and inclination of the day;</p>
<p>So may you by my dull and heavy 774 eye,</p>
<p>My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.</p>
<p>I play the torturer, by small 775 and small</p>
<p>To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken.</p>
<p>Your uncle York is joined with Bullingbrook,</p>
<p>And all your northern castles yielded up,</p>
<p>And all your southern gentlemen in arms</p>
<p>Upon his faction.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Thou hast said enough.</p>
<p>Beshrew 776 thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth</p>
<p>To Aumerle</p>
<p>Of 777 that sweet way I was in to despair!</p>
<p>What say you now? What comfort have we now?</p>
<p>By heaven, I’ll hate him everlastingly</p>
<p>That bids me be of comfort any more.</p>
<p>Go to Flint Castle 778 : there I’ll pine away.</p>
<p>A king, woe’s slave, shall kingly woe obey.</p>
<p>That power 779 I have, discharge 780 , and let ’em go</p>
<p>To ear 781 the land that hath some hope to grow,</p>
<p>For I have none. Let no man speak again</p>
<p>To alter this, for counsel is but vain.</p>
<p>AUMERLE My liege, one word.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD He does me double wrong</p>
<p>That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.</p>
<p>Discharge my followers. Let them hence away,</p>
<p>From Richard’s night to Bullingbrook’s fair day.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
