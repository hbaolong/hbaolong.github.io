continues</h4>
<p>Enter Nym, Bardolph, Pistol and Boy</p>
<p>BARDOLPH On, on, on, on, on! To the breach, to the breach!</p>
<p>NYM Pray thee, corporal, stay: the knocks 783 are too hot, and for
mine own part, I have not a case 784 of lives. The humour of it is too
hot, that is the very plainsong 785 of it.</p>
<p>PISTOL The plainsong is most just, for humours 786 do abound.</p>
<p>Knocks go and come, God’s vassals 787 drop and die,</p>
<p>And sword and shield,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>In bloody field,</p>
<p>Doth win immortal fame 788 .</p>
<p>BOY Would I were in an ale-house in London: I would give all my fame
for a pot of ale and safety.</p>
<p>PISTOL And I:</p>
<p>If wishes would prevail 789 with me,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>My purpose should not fail with me 790 ,</p>
<p>But thither would I hie 791 .</p>
<p>BOY As duly,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>But not as truly 792 ,</p>
<p>As bird doth sing on bough.</p>
<p>Enter Fluellen 793</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Up to the breach, you dogs! Avaunt 794 , you cullions 795
!</p>
<p>Drives them on</p>
<p>PISTOL Be merciful, great duke 796 , to men of mould 797 .</p>
<p>Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage,</p>
<p>Abate thy rage, great duke!</p>
<p>Good bawcock 798 , bate thy rage: use lenity 799 , sweet chuck 800
!</p>
<p>NYM These be good humours! Your honour wins bad humours 801 .</p>
<p>Exeunt [all but Boy ]</p>
<p>BOY As young as I am, I have observed these three swashers 802 . I am
boy 803 to them all three, but all they three, though they would serve
me, could not be man 804 to me; for indeed three such antics 805 do not
amount to a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered 806 and red-faced; by
the means whereof a faces 807 it out, but fights not. For Pistol, he
hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a breaks
words 808 , and keeps whole 809 weapons. For Nym, he hath heard that men
of few words are the best men, and therefore he scorns to say his
prayers, lest a should be thought a coward. But his few bad words are
matched with as few good deeds; for a never broke any man’s head but his
own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal
anything, and call it purchase 810 . Bardolph stole a lute- case, bore
it twelve leagues 811 , and sold it for three halfpence. Nym and
Bardolph are sworn brothers 812 in filching 813 , and in Calais 814 they
stole a fire-shovel 815 . I knew by that piece of service 816 the men
would carry coals 817 . They would have me as familiar with men’s
pockets 818 as their gloves or their handkerchiefs, which makes much
against my manhood 819 , if I should take from another’s pocket to put
into mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs 820 . I must leave
them, and seek some better service: their villainy goes against my weak
stomach 821 , and therefore I must cast it up 822 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Gower [and Fluellen ]</p>
<p>GOWER Captain Fluellen, you must come presently 823 to the mines 824
; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN To the mines? Tell you the duke, it is not 825 so good to
come to the mines, for look you, the mines is not according to the
disciplines 826 of the war: the concavities 827 of it is not sufficient,
for look you, th’athversary 828 , you may discuss 829 unto the duke,
look you, is digt 830 himself, four yard under, the countermines 831 .
By Cheshu 832 , I think a will plow up 833 all, if there is not better
directions 834 .</p>
<p>GOWER The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order 835 of the siege is
given, is altogether directed by an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman,
i’faith.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN It is Captain MacMorris, is it not?</p>
<p>GOWER I think it be.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in 836 the world. I will verify
as much in his beard 837 . He has no more directions in the true
disciplines of the wars, look you, of the</p>
<p>Roman disciplines 838 , than is a puppy dog.</p>
<p>Enter MacMorris and Captain Jamy</p>
<p>GOWER Here a comes, and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with
him.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Captain Jamy is a marvellous falorous 839 gentleman, that is
certain, and of great expedition 840 and knowledge in th’aunchient wars,
upon my particular knowledge of his directions. By Cheshu, he will
maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world, in the
disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans.</p>
<p>JAMY I say gud 841 day, Captain Fluellen.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN God-den 842 to your worship, good Captain James.</p>
<p>GOWER How now, Captain MacMorris? Have you quit the mines? Have the
pioneers 843 given o’er 844 ?</p>
<p>MACMORRIS By Chrish, la 845 , tish 846 ill done: the work ish give
over, the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, I swear, and my
father’s soul, the work ish ill done, it ish give over 847 . I would
have blowed up the town, so Chrish save me, la, in an hour. O, tish ill
done, tish ill done. By my hand, tish ill done!</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Captain MacMorris, I beseech you now, will you voutsafe 848
me, look you, a few disputations 849 with you, as partly touching or
concerning the disciplines of the war, the Roman wars, in the way of
argument, look you, and friendly communication —— partly to satisfy my
opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, look you, of my mind, as
touching the direction of the military discipline, that is the
point.</p>
<p>JAMY It sall 850 be vary gud, gud feith 851 , gud captains bath 852 ,
and I sall quit 853 you with gud leve 854 , as I may pick occasion 855 ;
that sall I, marry 856 .</p>
<p>MACMORRIS It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me. The day is
hot and the weather and the wars and the king and the dukes: it is no
time to discourse. The town is beseeched 857 , and the trumpet call us
to the breach, and we talk, and, be 858 Chrish, do nothing. ‘Tis shame
for us all. So God sa’ 859 me, ‘tis shame to stand still, it is shame,
by my hand. And there is throats to be cut, and works to be done, and
there ish nothing done, so Chrish sa’ me, la!</p>
<p>JAMY By the mess 860 , ere 861 these eyes of mine take themselves to
slomber, I’ll de gud service, or I’ll lig 862 i’th’grund for it; ay, or
go to death. And I’ll pay’t as valorously as I may, that sall I suerly
863 do, that is the breff 864 and the long 865 . Marry, I wad 866 full
fain 867 heard 868 some question 869 ’tween you tway 870 .</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Captain MacMorris, I think, look you, under your correction
871 , there is not many of your nation——</p>
<p>MACMORRIS Of my nation? What ish my nation? Ish a villain and a
bastard and a knave and a rascal 872 . What ish my nation? Who talks of
my nation?</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is meant,
Captain MacMorris, peradventure 873 I shall think you do not use 874 me
with that affability as in discretion 875 you ought to use me, look you,
being as good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of war, and in
the derivation of my birth, and in other particularities.</p>
<p>MACMORRIS I do not know you so good a man as myself. So Chrish save
me, I will cut off your head.</p>
<p>GOWER Gentlemen both, you will 876 mistake each other.</p>
<p>JAMY Ah, that’s a foul fault.</p>
<p>A parley 877</p>
<p>GOWER The town sounds a parley.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Captain MacMorris, when there is more better opportunity to
be required 878 , look you, I will be so bold as to tell you I know the
disciplines of war, and there is an end.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
