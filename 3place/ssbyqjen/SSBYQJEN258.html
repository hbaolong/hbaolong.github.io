18</h4>
<p>Enter Clown [Lavatch ], Old Lady [Countess ] and Lafew</p>
<p>LAFEW No, no, no, your son was misled with 1519 a snipt-taffeta 1520
fellow there, whose villainous saffron 1521 would have made all the
unbaked 1522 and doughy 1523 youth of a nation in his colour. Your 1524
daughter-in-law had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home,
more advanced by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee 1525 I
speak of.</p>
<p>COUNTESS I would I had not known him. It was the death of the most
virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If she
had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest 1526 groans of a
mother 1527 , I could not have owed her a more rooted 1528 love.</p>
<p>LAFEW ’Twas a good lady, ’twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand
salads ere we light on 1529 such another herb.</p>
<p>LAVATCH Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram 1530 of the salad, or
rather, the herb of grace 1531 .</p>
<p>LAFEW They are not herbs 1532 , you knave, they are nose-herbs 1533
.</p>
<p>LAVATCH I am no great Nebuchadnezzar 1534 , sir. I have not much
skill in grace 1535 .</p>
<p>LAFEW Whether 1536 dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool 1537
?</p>
<p>LAVATCH A fool, sir, at a woman’s service 1538 , and a knave at a
man’s.</p>
<p>LAFEW Your distinction?</p>
<p>LAVATCH I would cozen 1539 the man of his wife and do his service
1540 .</p>
<p>LAFEW So you were a knave at his service, indeed.</p>
<p>LAVATCH And I would give his wife my bauble 1541 , sir, to do 1542
her service.</p>
<p>LAFEW I will subscribe 1543 for thee, thou art both knave and
fool.</p>
<p>LAVATCH At your service.</p>
<p>LAFEW No, no, no.</p>
<p>LAVATCH Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a
prince as you are.</p>
<p>LAFEW Who’s that? A Frenchman?</p>
<p>LAVATCH Faith, sir, a has an English maine 1544 , but his fisnomy
1545 is more hotter in France 1546 than there.</p>
<p>LAFEW What prince is that?</p>
<p>LAVATCH The black prince 1547 , sir, alias the prince of darkness,
alias the devil.</p>
<p>LAFEW Hold thee 1548 , there’s my purse: I give thee not this to
suggest 1549 thee from thy master thou talkest of. Serve him still.</p>
<p>Gives a purse</p>
<p>LAVATCH I am a woodland 1550 fellow, sir, that always loved a great
fire 1551 , and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But sure
he is the prince of the world 1552 . Let his nobility remain in’s court.
I am for the house with the narrow gate 1553 , which I take to be too
little for pomp 1554 to enter. Some that humble themselves may, but the
many 1555 will be too chill 1556 and tender 1557 , and they’ll be for
the flowery way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.</p>
<p>LAFEW Go thy ways 1558 , I begin to be aweary of thee, and I tell
thee so before 1559 , because I would not fall out with thee. Go thy
ways. Let my horses be well looked to, without any tricks 1560 .</p>
<p>LAVATCH If I put any tricks upon ‘em, sir, they shall be jades’
tricks 1561 , which are their own right by the law of nature.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>LAFEW A shrewd 1562 knave and an unhappy 1563 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS So a is. My lord that’s gone 1564 made himself much sport
out of him. By his authority he remains here, which he thinks is a
patent for his sauciness, and indeed he has no pace 1565 , but runs
where he will.</p>
<p>LAFEW I like him well, ’tis not amiss. And I was about to tell you,
since I heard of the good lady’s 1566 death and that my lord your son
was upon his return home, I moved 1567 the king my master to speak in
the behalf of my daughter, which, in the minority 1568 of them both, his
majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance 1569 did first propose 1570
. His highness hath promised me to do it, and to stop up the displeasure
he hath conceived against your son, there is no fitter matter. How does
your ladyship like it?</p>
<p>COUNTESS With very much content, my lord, and I wish it happily
effected.</p>
<p>LAFEW His highness comes post 1571 from Marseilles, of as able body
as when he numbered 1572 thirty. A will be here tomorrow, or I am
deceived by him 1573 that in such intelligence 1574 hath seldom
failed.</p>
<p>COUNTESS It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die. I have
letters that my son will be here tonight. I shall beseech your lordship
to remain with me till they meet together.</p>
<p>LAFEW Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be
admitted 1575 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS You need but 1576 plead your honourable privilege 1577 .</p>
<p>LAFEW Lady, of that I have made a bold charter 1578 , but I thank my
God it holds yet.</p>
<p>Enter Clown [Lavatch ]</p>
<p>LAVATCH O madam, yonder’s my lord your son with a patch of velvet
1579 on’s face. Whether there be a scar under’t or no, the velvet knows
1580 , but ’tis a goodly patch of velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of
two pile and a half 1581 , but his right cheek is worn bare 1582 .</p>
<p>LAFEW A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv’ry 1583 of
honour, so belike 1584 is that.</p>
<p>LAVATCH But it is your carbonadoed 1585 face.</p>
<p>LAFEW Let us go see your son, I pray you. I long to talk with the
young noble soldier.</p>
<p>LAVATCH Faith, there’s a dozen of ’em, with delicate fine hats and
most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
