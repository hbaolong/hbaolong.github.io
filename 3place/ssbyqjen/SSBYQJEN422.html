<h4 id="scene-2-653-running-scene-6">Scene 2 653 / running scene 6</h4>
<p>Enter Lucius with three Strangers</p>
<p>LUCIUS Who, the Lord Timon? He is my very good friend, and an
honourable gentleman.</p>
<p>FIRST STRANGER We know him for 654 no less, though we are but
strangers to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and which I
hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon’s happy hours are done and
past, and his estate shrinks from him.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Fie, no, do not believe it: he cannot want for money.</p>
<p>SECOND STRANGER But believe you this, my lord, that not long ago, one
of his men was with the lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents — nay,
urged extremely for’t and showed what necessity belonged to’t 655 , and
yet was denied.</p>
<p>LUCIUS How? 656</p>
<p>SECOND STRANGER I tell you, denied, my lord.</p>
<p>LUCIUS What a strange case was that? Now before the gods, I am
ashamed on’t. Denied that honourable man? There was very little honour
showed in’t. For my own part, I must needs confess I have received some
small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels and such-like trifles
— nothing comparing to his 657 : yet, had he mistook him 658 and sent to
me, I should ne’er have denied his occasion 659 so many talents.</p>
<p>Enter Servilius</p>
<p>SERVILIUS See, by good hap 660 , yonder’s my lord:</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>I have sweat 661 to see his honour.— My honoured lord.—</p>
<p>To Lucius</p>
<p>LUCIUS Servilius! You are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well: commend me
to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very exquisite 662 friend.</p>
<p>SERVILIUS May it please your honour, my lord hath sent—</p>
<p>LUCIUS Ha? What has he sent? I am so much endeared 663 to that lord;
he’s ever sending: how shall I thank him, think’st thou? And what has he
sent now?</p>
<p>SERVILIUS Has only sent his present occasion 664 now, my lord,
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use 665 with so many
talents.</p>
<p>Presents a note</p>
<p>LUCIUS I know his lordship is but merry 666 with me:</p>
<p>He cannot want fifty— five hundred talents!</p>
<p>Reads the note</p>
<p>SERVILIUS But in the meantime he wants less, my lord.</p>
<p>If his occasion were not virtuous 667 ,</p>
<p>I should not urge it half so faithfully.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?</p>
<p>SERVILIUS Upon my soul, ’tis true, sir.</p>
<p>LUCIUS What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against 668
such a good time, when I might ha’ shown myself honourable! How
unluckily it happened that I should purchase the day before for a little
part 669 , and undo a great deal of honour 670 . Servilius, now before
the gods, I am not able to do — the more beast, I say — I was sending to
use 671 Lord Timon myself — these gentlemen can witness — but I would
672 not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done’t now. Commend me
bountifully to his good lordship, and I hope his honour will conceive
the fairest 673 of me because I have no power to be kind 674 : and tell
him this from me, I count it one of my greatest afflictions, say, that I
cannot pleasure 675 such an honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will
you befriend me so far 676 , as to use mine own words to him?</p>
<p>SERVILIUS Yes, sir, I shall.</p>
<p>Exit Servilius</p>
<p>LUCIUS I’ll look you out a good turn 677 , Servilius.—</p>
<p>Calls after him</p>
<p>True as you said, Timon is shrunk 678 indeed:</p>
<p>And he that’s once denied will hardly speed 679 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>FIRST STRANGER Do you observe this, Hostilius?</p>
<p>SECOND STRANGER Ay, too well.</p>
<p>FIRST STRANGER Why, this is the world’s soul 680 , and just of the
same piece 681</p>
<p>Is every flatterer’s sport. Who can call him his friend</p>
<p>That dips in the same dish 682 ? For, in my knowing 683 ,</p>
<p>Timon has been this lord’s father 684 ,</p>
<p>And kept his 685 credit 686 with his purse,</p>
<p>Supported his estate: nay, Timon’s money</p>
<p>Has paid his men their wages. He ne’er drinks,</p>
<p>But Timon’s silver treads 687 upon his lip,</p>
<p>And yet — O, see the monstrousness 688 of man</p>
<p>When he looks out 689 in an ungrateful shape! —</p>
<p>He does deny him, in respect of his 690 ,</p>
<p>What charitable men afford to beggars.</p>
<p>THIRD STRANGER Religion groans at it.</p>
<p>FIRST STRANGER For mine own part,</p>
<p>I never tasted Timon 691 in my life,</p>
<p>Nor came any of his bounties over 692 me</p>
<p>To mark me for his friend: yet I protest,</p>
<p>For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue</p>
<p>And honourable carriage 693 ,</p>
<p>Had his necessity made use of me</p>
<p>I would have put my wealth into donation 694 ,</p>
<p>And the best half should have returned to him,</p>
<p>So much I love his heart. But I perceive</p>
<p>Men must learn now with pity to dispense 695 ,</p>
<p>For policy 696 sits above conscience.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
