<h4 id="scene-3-278-running-scene-3">Scene 3 278 / running scene 3</h4>
<p>Enter Countess, Steward [Reynaldo ] and Clown [Lavatch 279 ]</p>
<p>COUNTESS I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman 280 ?</p>
<p>REYNALDO Madam, the care I have had to even your content 281 , I wish
might be found in the calendar 282 of my past endeavours, for then we
wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness 283 of our deservings 284
, when of ourselves we publish them 285 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah 286 . The
complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe. ’Tis my slowness
that I do not, for I know you lack not folly to commit them, and have
ability enough to make such knaveries yours.</p>
<p>LAVATCH ’Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor 287 fellow.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Well 288 , sir.</p>
<p>LAVATCH No, madam, ’tis not so well that I am poor, though many of
the rich are damned. But if I may have your ladyship’s good will to go
to the world 289 , Isbel 290 the woman 291 and I will do 292 as we
may.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Wilt thou needs 293 be a beggar?</p>
<p>LAVATCH I do beg your good will in this case 294 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS In what case?</p>
<p>LAVATCH In Isbel’s case and mine own. Service 295 is no heritage 296
: and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue
o’ my body 297 , for they say bairns 298 are blessings.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.</p>
<p>LAVATCH My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the
flesh, and he must needs go 299 that the devil drives.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Is this all your worship 300 ’s reason?</p>
<p>LAVATCH Faith, madam, I have other holy 301 reasons, such as they
are.</p>
<p>COUNTESS May the world 302 know them?</p>
<p>LAVATCH I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh
and blood are, and indeed I do marry that I may repent 303 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.</p>
<p>LAVATCH I am out o’ friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for my
wife’s sake 304 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS Such friends are thine enemies, knave.</p>
<p>LAVATCH You’re shallow 305 , madam, in 306 great friends, for the
knaves come to do 307 that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears 308
my land 309 spares my team 310 and gives me leave 311 to in 312 the crop
313 . If I be his cuckold 314 , he’s my drudge 315 ; he that comforts
316 my wife is the cherisher 317 of my flesh and blood; he that
cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my
flesh and blood is my friend: ergo 318 , he that kisses my wife is my
friend. If men could be contented to be what they are 319 , there were
no fear in marriage, for young Charbon the Puritan 320 and old Poysam
the Papist 321 , howsome’er 322 their hearts are severed in religion,
their heads are both one 323 . They may jowl 324 horns together, like
any deer i’th’herd.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Wilt thou ever 325 be a foul-mouthed and calumnious 326
knave?</p>
<p>LAVATCH A prophet I, madam, and I speak the truth the next 327
way.</p>
<p>For I the ballad will repeat,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Which men full true shall find:</p>
<p>Your marriage comes by destiny,</p>
<p>Your cuckoo sings by kind 328 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS Get you gone, sir. I’ll talk with you more anon 329 .</p>
<p>REYNALDO May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you: of
her I am to speak.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her — Helen,
I mean.</p>
<p>To Lavatch</p>
<p>LAVATCH ‘Was this fair face 330 the cause,’ quoth she 331 ,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>’Why the Grecians sackèd 332 Troy 333 ?</p>
<p>Fond 334 done, done fond,</p>
<p>Was this King Priam 335 ‘s joy?’</p>
<p>With that she sighèd as she stood,</p>
<p>With that she sighèd as she stood,</p>
<p>And gave this sentence 336 then:</p>
<p>’Among 337 nine bad if one be good,</p>
<p>Among nine bad if one be good,</p>
<p>There’s yet one good in ten.’</p>
<p>COUNTESS What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song 338 ,
sirrah.</p>
<p>LAVATCH One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying 339
o’th’song. Would God would serve the world 340 so all the year! We’d
find no fault with the tithe-woman 341 , if I were the parson. One in
ten, quoth a? An 342 we might have a good woman born but ere every
blazing star 343 , or at an earthquake 344 , ’twould mend the lottery
well 345 . A man may draw 346 his heart out ere a pluck one 347 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS You’ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you?</p>
<p>LAVATCH That 348 man should be at woman’s command, and yet no hurt
done! Though honesty 349 be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt. It will
wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart 350 . I
am going, forsooth 351 . The business is for Helen to come hither.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>COUNTESS Well, now.</p>
<p>REYNALDO I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Faith, I do. Her father bequeathed 352 her to me, and she
herself, without other advantage 353 , may lawfully make title 354 to as
much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid and more
shall be paid her than she’ll demand.</p>
<p>REYNALDO Madam, I was very late 355 more near her than I think she
wished me. Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words
to her own ears. She thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any
stranger sense 356 . Her matter 357 was, she loved your son. Fortune,
she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two
estates 358 . Love no 359 god, that would not extend his might only
where qualities 360 were level. Dian 361 no queen of virgins, that would
suffer 362 her poor knight surprised 363 without rescue in the first
assault or ransom afterward. This she delivered in the most bitter touch
364 of sorrow that e’er I heard virgin exclaim in, which I held my duty
speedily to acquaint you withal 365 , sithence 366 , in the loss 367
that may happen, it concerns you something 368 to know it.</p>
<p>COUNTESS You have discharged 369 this honestly. Keep it to yourself.
Many likelihoods 370 informed me of this before, which hung so tott’ring
in the balance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt 371 . Pray you
leave me. Stall 372 this in your bosom, and I thank you for your honest
care. I will speak with you further anon.</p>
<p>Exit Steward [Reynaldo ]</p>
<p>Enter Helen</p>
<p>Even so it was with me when I was young.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>If ever we are nature’s, these 373 are ours. This thorn</p>
<p>Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong.</p>
<p>Our blood 374 to us, this to our blood is born:</p>
<p>It is the show 375 and seal 376 of nature’s truth,</p>
<p>Where love’s strong passion is impressed 377 in youth.</p>
<p>By our remembrances of days foregone,</p>
<p>Such were our faults, or 378 then we thought them none.</p>
<p>Her eye is sick on’t. I observe 379 her now.</p>
<p>HELEN What is your pleasure, madam?</p>
<p>COUNTESS You know, Helen, I am a mother to you.</p>
<p>HELEN Mine honourable mistress.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Nay, a mother. Why not a mother? When I said ‘a mother’,</p>
<p>Methought 380 you saw a serpent. What’s in ‘mother’</p>
<p>That you start 381 at it? I say I am your mother,</p>
<p>And put you in the catalogue of those</p>
<p>That were enwombèd mine 382 . ’Tis often seen</p>
<p>Adoption 383 strives 384 with nature 385 , and choice breeds</p>
<p>A native slip to us from foreign seeds 386 .</p>
<p>You ne’er oppressed me with a mother’s groan 387 ,</p>
<p>Yet I express to you a mother’s care.</p>
<p>God’s mercy, maiden! Does it curd 388 thy blood</p>
<p>To say I am thy mother? What’s the matter,</p>
<p>That this distempered 389 messenger of wet,</p>
<p>The many-coloured Iris 390 , rounds 391 thine eye?</p>
<p>— Why? That you are my daughter?</p>
<p>HELEN That I am not 392 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS I say I am your mother.</p>
<p>HELEN Pardon, madam.</p>
<p>The Count Rossillion cannot be my brother:</p>
<p>I am from humble, he from honoured name,</p>
<p>No note 393 upon my parents 394 , his all noble.</p>
<p>My master, my dear lord he is, and I</p>
<p>His servant live, and will his vassal 395 die.</p>
<p>He must not be my brother.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Nor I your mother.</p>
<p>HELEN You are my mother, madam, would you were —</p>
<p>So 396 that my lord your son were not my brother —</p>
<p>Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers 397 ,</p>
<p>I care no more for than 398 I do for heaven,</p>
<p>So I were not his sister. Can’t no other 399</p>
<p>But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?</p>
<p>COUNTESS Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>God shield 400 you mean it not! Daughter and mother</p>
<p>So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?</p>
<p>My fear hath catched 401 your fondness 402 . Now I see</p>
<p>The mystery of your loveliness 403 , and find</p>
<p>Your salt tears’ head 404 . Now to all sense 405 ’tis gross 406 :</p>
<p>You love my son. Invention 407 is ashamed</p>
<p>Against 408 the proclamation of thy passion</p>
<p>To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true.</p>
<p>But tell me then ’tis so, for look, thy cheeks</p>
<p>Confess it, t’one to th’other, and thine eyes</p>
<p>See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours</p>
<p>That in their kind 409 they speak it. Only sin</p>
<p>And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,</p>
<p>That truth should be suspected 410 . Speak, is’t so?</p>
<p>If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew 411 .</p>
<p>If it be not, forswear’t 412 : howe’er 413 , I charge 414 thee,</p>
<p>As heaven shall work in me for thine avail 415 ,</p>
<p>To tell me truly.</p>
<p>HELEN Good madam, pardon me.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Do you love my son?</p>
<p>HELEN Your pardon, noble mistress.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Love you my son?</p>
<p>HELEN Do not you love him, madam?</p>
<p>COUNTESS Go not about 416 ; my love hath in’t a bond 417</p>
<p>Whereof the world takes note 418 . Come, come, disclose</p>
<p>The state of your affection, for your passions</p>
<p>Have to the full appeached 419 .</p>
<p>HELEN Then I confess,</p>
<p>↑ Kneels ↑</p>
<p>Here on my knee, before 420 high heaven and you,</p>
<p>That before you, and next unto high heaven,</p>
<p>I love your son.</p>
<p>My friends 421 were poor but honest, so’s my love.</p>
<p>Be not offended, for it hurts not him</p>
<p>That he is loved of me; I follow him not</p>
<p>By any token 422 of presumptuous suit 423 ,</p>
<p>Nor would I have him till I do deserve him,</p>
<p>Yet never know how that desert should be.</p>
<p>I know I love in vain, strive against hope.</p>
<p>Yet in this captious 424 and intenible 425 sieve</p>
<p>I still 426 pour in the waters of my love</p>
<p>And lack not to lose still 427 ; thus, Indian-like,</p>
<p>Religious 428 in mine error, I adore</p>
<p>The sun that looks upon his worshipper</p>
<p>But knows of him no more 429 . My dearest madam,</p>
<p>Let not your hate encounter with 430 my love,</p>
<p>For loving where you do; but if yourself,</p>
<p>Whose agèd honour cites 431 a virtuous youth,</p>
<p>Did ever in so true a flame of liking</p>
<p>Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian</p>
<p>Was both herself 432 and love — O, then, give pity</p>
<p>To her whose state is such that cannot choose</p>
<p>But lend and give where she is sure to lose 433 ;</p>
<p>That seeks not to find that 434 her search implies 435 ,</p>
<p>But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies 436 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS Had you not lately an intent — speak truly —</p>
<p>To go to Paris?</p>
<p>HELEN Madam, I had.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Wherefore? 437 Tell true.</p>
<p>HELEN I will tell truth, by grace 438 itself I swear.</p>
<p>You know my father left me some prescriptions 439</p>
<p>Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading</p>
<p>And manifest 440 experience had collected</p>
<p>For general sovereignty 441 , and that he willed me</p>
<p>In heedfull’st reservation to bestow them 442 ,</p>
<p>As notes 443 whose faculties inclusive 444 were</p>
<p>More than they were in note 445 . Amongst the rest,</p>
<p>There is a remedy, approved 446 , set down,</p>
<p>To cure the desp’rate 447 languishings whereof</p>
<p>The king is rendered lost 448 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS This was your motive for Paris, was it? Speak.</p>
<p>HELEN My lord your son made me to think of this;</p>
<p>Else Paris and the medicine and the king</p>
<p>Had from the conversation 449 of my thoughts</p>
<p>Haply 450 been absent then.</p>
<p>COUNTESS But think you, Helen,</p>
<p>If you should tender 451 your supposèd aid,</p>
<p>He would receive it? He and his physicians</p>
<p>Are of a mind 452 . He, that they cannot help him,</p>
<p>They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit 453</p>
<p>A poor unlearnèd virgin, when the schools 454 ,</p>
<p>Embowelled 455 of their doctrine 456 , have left off 457</p>
<p>The danger to itself?</p>
<p>HELEN There’s something in’t</p>
<p>More than my father’s skill, which was the great’st</p>
<p>Of his profession, that his good receipt 458</p>
<p>Shall for my legacy be sanctified 459</p>
<p>By th’luckiest stars in heaven, and would your honour</p>
<p>But give me leave to try success 460 , I’d venture 461</p>
<p>The well-lost 462 life of mine on his grace’s cure</p>
<p>By such a 463 day and hour.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Dost thou believe’t?</p>
<p>HELEN Ay, madam, knowingly 464 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave 465 and love,</p>
<p>Means and attendants and my loving greetings</p>
<p>To those of mine in court. I’ll stay at home</p>
<p>And pray God’s blessing into 466 thy attempt.</p>
<p>Be gone tomorrow. And be sure of this:</p>
<p>What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss 467 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
