continues</h4>
<p>Alarum. Enter Richard, Duke of York</p>
<p>YORK The army of the queen hath got 171 the field.</p>
<p>My uncles 172 both are slain in rescuing me;</p>
<p>And all my followers to 173 the eager 174 foe</p>
<p>Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind,</p>
<p>Or lambs pursued by hunger-starvèd wolves.</p>
<p>My sons, God knows what hath bechancèd 175 them:</p>
<p>But this I know, they have demeaned 176 themselves</p>
<p>Like men born to renown by life or death.</p>
<p>Three times did Richard make a lane 177 to me,</p>
<p>And thrice cried ‘Courage, father, fight it out!’</p>
<p>And full as oft 178 came Edward to my side,</p>
<p>With purple 179 falchion 180 , painted to the hilt</p>
<p>In blood of those that had encountered 181 him.</p>
<p>And when the hardiest 182 warriors did retire,</p>
<p>Richard cried ‘Charge, and give no foot of ground!’</p>
<p>And cried ’A crown, or else a glorious tomb,</p>
<p>A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!’</p>
<p>With this we charged again, but, out, alas 183 ,</p>
<p>We bodged 184 again, as I have seen a swan</p>
<p>With bootless 185 labour swim against the tide</p>
<p>And spend 186 her strength with overmatching 187 waves.</p>
<p>A short alarum within</p>
<p>Ah, hark, the fatal 188 followers do pursue,</p>
<p>And I am faint and cannot fly their fury.</p>
<p>And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.</p>
<p>The sands 189 are numbered that makes up my life.</p>
<p>Here must I stay, and here my life must end.</p>
<p>Enter the Queen, Clifford, Northumberland, the young Prince and
Soldiers</p>
<p>Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,</p>
<p>I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:</p>
<p>I am your butt 190 , and I abide 191 your shot.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,</p>
<p>With downright payment 192 , showed unto my father.</p>
<p>Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car 193 ,</p>
<p>And made an evening at the noontide prick 194 .</p>
<p>YORK My ashes, as the phoenix 195 , may bring forth</p>
<p>A bird 196 that will revenge upon you all.</p>
<p>And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,</p>
<p>Scorning whate’er you can afflict me with.</p>
<p>Why come you not? What, multitudes and fear 197 ?</p>
<p>CLIFFORD So cowards fight when they can fly no further,</p>
<p>So doves do peck the falcon’s piercing talons,</p>
<p>So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,</p>
<p>Breathe out invectives gainst the officers.</p>
<p>YORK O Clifford, but bethink thee 198 once again,</p>
<p>An in thy thought o’er-run 199 my former time:</p>
<p>An if thou canst for 200 blushing, view this face,</p>
<p>And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice</p>
<p>Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!</p>
<p>CLIFFORD I will not bandy 201 with thee word for word,</p>
<p>But buckler 202 with thee blows, twice two for one.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Hold 203 , valiant Clifford, for a thousand causes
204</p>
<p>I would prolong awhile the traitor’s life.—</p>
<p>Wrath makes him deaf; speak thou, Northumberland.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Hold, Clifford, do not honour him so much</p>
<p>To prick thy finger, though to 205 wound his heart.</p>
<p>What valour were it, when a cur doth grin 206 ,</p>
<p>For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,</p>
<p>When he might spurn 207 him with his foot away?</p>
<p>It is war’s prize 208 to take all vantages 209 ,</p>
<p>And ten to one is no impeach of valour 210 .</p>
<p>They seize York, who struggles</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock 211 with the gin 212 .</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND So doth the cony 213 struggle in the net.</p>
<p>YORK So triumph thieves upon their conquered booty,</p>
<p>So true 214 men yield, with robbers so o’ermatched 215 .</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND What would your grace have done unto him now?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,</p>
<p>Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,</p>
<p>That raught 216 at mountains with outstretchèd arms,</p>
<p>Yet parted 217 but the shadow with his hand.—</p>
<p>What, was it you that would be England’s king?</p>
<p>To York</p>
<p>Was’t you that revelled 218 in our parliament,</p>
<p>And made a preachment 219 of your high descent?</p>
<p>Where are your mess 220 of sons to back you now,</p>
<p>The wanton 221 Edward and the lusty 222 George?</p>
<p>And where’s that valiant crook-back prodigy 223 ,</p>
<p>Dicky, your boy, that with his grumbling 224 voice</p>
<p>Was wont 225 to cheer his dad in mutinies?</p>
<p>Or with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?</p>
<p>Look, York, I stained this napkin 226 with the blood</p>
<p>That valiant Clifford, with his rapier’s point,</p>
<p>Made issue 227 from the bosom of the boy.</p>
<p>And if thine eyes can water for his death,</p>
<p>I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal 228 .</p>
<p>Alas poor York, but 229 that I hate thee deadly,</p>
<p>I should lament thy miserable state.</p>
<p>I prithee 230 grieve to make me merry, York.</p>
<p>What, hath thy fiery heart so parched 231 thine entrails 232</p>
<p>That not a tear can fall for Rutland’s death?</p>
<p>Why art thou patient, man? Thou shouldst be mad.</p>
<p>And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.</p>
<p>Stamp, rave and fret 233 , that I may sing and dance.</p>
<p>Thou wouldst be fee’d 234 , I see, to make me sport 235 .</p>
<p>York cannot speak unless he wear a crown.</p>
<p>A crown for York! And, lords, bow low to him.</p>
<p>Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.</p>
<p>Puts a paper crown on his head</p>
<p>Ay, marry 236 , sir, now looks he like a king.</p>
<p>Ay, this is he that took King Henry’s chair 237 ,</p>
<p>And this is he was his adopted heir.</p>
<p>But how is it that great Plantagenet</p>
<p>Is crowned so soon and broke his solemn oath?</p>
<p>As I bethink me, you should not be king</p>
<p>Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.</p>
<p>And will you pale 238 your head in Henry’s glory,</p>
<p>And rob his temples of the diadem 239 ,</p>
<p>Now in his life, against your holy oath?</p>
<p>O, ’tis a fault too too unpardonable!</p>
<p>Off with the crown, and with the crown his head.</p>
<p>And whilst we breathe 240 , take time to do him dead.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD That is my office 241 , for my father’s sake.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Nay, stay, let’s hear the orisons 242 he makes.</p>
<p>YORK She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,</p>
<p>Whose tongue more poisons than the adder’s tooth!</p>
<p>How ill-beseeming 243 is it in thy sex</p>
<p>To triumph 244 , like an Amazonian 245 trull 246 ,</p>
<p>Upon their woes whom fortune captivates 247 !</p>
<p>But that thy face is vizard-like 248 , unchanging,</p>
<p>Made impudent 249 with use 250 of evil deeds,</p>
<p>I would assay 251 , proud queen, to make thee blush.</p>
<p>To tell thee whence 252 thou cam’st, of whom derived 253 ,</p>
<p>Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.</p>
<p>Thy father bears the type 254 of King of Naples,</p>
<p>Of both the Sicils 255 and Jerusalem,</p>
<p>Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman 256 .</p>
<p>Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult 257 ?</p>
<p>It needs not, nor it boots 258 thee not, proud queen,</p>
<p>Unless the adage 259 must be verified,</p>
<p>That beggars mounted 260 run their horse to death.</p>
<p>’Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud,</p>
<p>But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small.</p>
<p>’Tis virtue that doth make them most admired,</p>
<p>The contrary doth make thee wondered 261 at.</p>
<p>’Tis government 262 that makes them seem divine,</p>
<p>The want 263 thereof makes thee abominable 264 .</p>
<p>Thou art as opposite to every good</p>
<p>As the Antipodes 265 are unto us,</p>
<p>Or as the south to the Septentrion 266 .</p>
<p>O, tiger’s heart wrapt in a woman’s hide!</p>
<p>How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,</p>
<p>To bid the father wipe his eyes withal 267 ,</p>
<p>And yet be seen to bear a woman’s face?</p>
<p>Women are soft, mild, pitiful 268 and flexible 269 ;</p>
<p>Thou stern, obdurate 270 , flinty 271 , rough 272 , remorseless.</p>
<p>Bid’st thou me rage? Why, now thou hast thy wish.</p>
<p>Wouldst have me weep? Why, now thou hast thy will.</p>
<p>For raging wind blows up incessant showers,</p>
<p>And when the rage allays, the rain begins.</p>
<p>These tears are my sweet Rutland’s obsequies 273 ,</p>
<p>And every drop cries vengeance for his death,</p>
<p>Gainst thee, fell 274 Clifford, and thee, false 275 Frenchwoman.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Beshrew 276 me, but his passions moves me so</p>
<p>That hardly can I check 277 my eyes from tears.</p>
<p>YORK That face of his the hungry cannibals</p>
<p>Would not have touched, would not have stained with blood.</p>
<p>But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,</p>
<p>O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania 278 .</p>
<p>See, ruthless queen, a hapless 279 father’s tears.</p>
<p>This cloth thou dipped’st in blood of my sweet boy,</p>
<p>And I with tears do wash the blood away.</p>
<p>Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this,</p>
<p>And if thou tell’st the heavy 280 story right,</p>
<p>Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears.</p>
<p>Yea, even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,</p>
<p>And say ‘Alas, it was a piteous 281 deed!’</p>
<p>There, take the crown, and with the crown, my curse.</p>
<p>And in thy need such comfort come to thee</p>
<p>As now I reap at thy too cruel hand.</p>
<p>Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:</p>
<p>My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Had he been slaughterman to all my kin,</p>
<p>I should not for my life but weep with him,</p>
<p>To see how inly 282 sorrow gripes 283 his soul.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET What, weeping-ripe 284 , my lord Northumberland?</p>
<p>Think but upon the wrong he did us all,</p>
<p>And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Here’s for my oath, here’s for my father’s death.</p>
<p>Stabs him twice</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET And here’s to right our gentle-hearted 285 king.</p>
<p>Stabs him</p>
<p>YORK Open thy gate of mercy, gracious God.</p>
<p>My soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee.</p>
<p>Dies</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Off with his head and set it on York gates,</p>
<p>So York may overlook the town of York.</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt [with the body ]</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
