<h4 id="introduction-to-the-taming-of-the-shrew">Introduction to The
Taming of the Shrew</h4>
<p>The novelist Vladimir Nabokov once wrote that ‘reality’ is a word
that only has meaning when it is placed in quotation marks. The
physicist’s ‘reality’ is not the same as the biochemist’s, the secular
humanist’s as the religious fundamentalist’s. Dare one say the woman’s
is not the same as the man’s? In a culture where the conception of
inherent sexual difference is regarded as a mere prejudice, as a
forbidden thought (regardless of the ‘reality’ revealed by molecular
biology and neuroanatomy), The Taming of the Shrew is not likely to be
one of Shakespeare’s most admired plays. Its presentation of female
subordination presents the same kind of awkwardness for liberal
sensibilities that the representation of Shylock does in the
post-Holocaust world. At face value, the play proposes that desirable
women are quiet and submissive, whereas women with spirit must be
‘tamed’ through a combination of physical and mental abuse. Necessary
tools may include starvation, sense deprivation and the kind of
distortion of ‘reality’ that is practised in totalitarian regimes.</p>
<p>Thus O’Brien to Winston Smith in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four
: ‘How many fingers am I holding up?’ In this ‘reality’ the correct
answer is not the actual number but the number that the torturer says he
is holding up. There is a precise analogy on the road back to Padua,
after Kate has undergone her taming in the secluded country house where
no neighbour will hear her cries:</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO I say it is the moon.</p>
<p>KATE I know it is the moon.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Nay, then you lie. It is the blessèd sun.</p>
<p>KATE Then, God be blessed, it is the blessèd sun.</p>
<p>But sun it is not, when you say it is not,</p>
<p>And the moon changes even as your mind.</p>
<p>What you will have it named, even that it is,</p>
<p>And so it shall be so for Katherine.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won.</p>
<p>She has been bent to her husband’s will. She is now ready to
demonstrate that she is prepared to love, serve and obey him. She knows
her place: ‘Such duty as the subject owes the prince / Even such a woman
oweth to her husband.’ She offers to place her hand beneath her
husband’s foot. The shrew is tamed.</p>
<p>The younger dramatist John Fletcher, who was Shakespeare’s
collaborator in his final years, clearly thought that this harsh ending
needed a riposte. He wrote a sequel, The Woman’s Prize; or, The Tamer
Tamed , in which Kate has died and Petruchio remarried, only to find his
new wife giving him a taste of his own medicine by means of the
time-honoured device of refusing to sleep with him until he submits to
her will. Kate’s sister Bianca plays the role of colonel in a war
between the sexes which the women win, thus proving that it was an act
of folly for Petruchio to tyrannize over his first wife in Shakespeare’s
play.</p>
<p>In Shakespeare’s time, it was absolutely orthodox to believe that a
man was head of the household, as the monarch was head of state and God
was head of the cosmos. ‘My foot my tutor?’ says Prospero in The Tempest
when his daughter Miranda presumes to speak out of turn: if the man was
the head, the girl-child was the foot, just as in Coriolanus a plebeian
is nothing more than the ‘big toe’ of the commonwealth. Kate’s readying
of her hand to be trodden upon turns the analogy between social and
bodily hierarchy into a stage image. But she is going much further than
she should: the wife was not supposed to be beneath the foot, she was
supposed to be the heart of the household. Instead of crowing in his
triumph, Petruchio says ‘kiss me, Kate’ for the third time, giving Cole
Porter a title for his reimagining of the story in the cheerful mode of
a musical.</p>
<p>Nabokov placed the word ‘reality’ in quotation marks not because he
was a cultural relativist, but because he was an aesthete. That is to
say, he did not believe that art was merely a reflection, a mirror, of a
pre-existent ‘reality’. Art shapes the way in which we perceive
ourselves and the world. ‘Falling in love’ is not only the work of
molecular change in the brain, but also a set of behaviours learned from
the romantic fictions of page, stage – now screen – and cultural memory.
One of the tricks of great art is to draw attention to its own
artificiality and in so doing paradoxically assert that its ‘reality’ is
as real as anything in the quotidian world of its audience.
Shakespeare’s taste for plays-within-the-play and allusions to the
theatricality of the world, Mozart’s witty quotations of the clichés of
operatic convention and Nabokov’s magical wordplay all fulfil this
function.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, the opposite device is used: an artist puts
quotation marks around a work in order to say ‘Don’t take this too
seriously, don’t mistake its feigning for’‘reality’‘.’ The Taming of the
Shrew is such a work: the opening scenes with Christopher Sly place the
entire play within quotation marks. The ‘induction’ presents a series of
wish-fulfilment fantasies to a drunken tinker: the fantasy that he is a
lord, that he has a beautiful young wife, that scenes of erotic delight
can be presented for his delectation, and that a company of professional
players will stage ‘a kind of history’ for his sole benefit, in order to
frame his mind to ‘mirth and merriment’ whilst teaching him how to tame
a shrewish wife. But Sly is not a lord and the ‘wife’ who watches with
him is not a woman but a cross-dressed boy (which reminds us that in
Shakespeare’s working world the Kate who is humiliated by Petruchio was
also not a woman but a cross-dressed boy-actor). The effect of the frame
is to ‘distance’ the action and so suggest that it does not present the
‘reality’ of proper marital relations. If Sly is not a lord and the
pageboy not a wife, then this is not how to tame a shrew.</p>
<p>In the surviving script of the play, Sly and the pageboy disappear
after the first act, presumably because Shakespeare’s acting company was
not large enough to waste several members of the cast sitting in the
gallery as spectators all the way through. But in an anonymously
published play of 1594 called The Taming of a Shrew , which seems to be
some sort of adaptation, reconstruction or variant version, the
Christopher Sly ‘frame’ is maintained throughout the action by means of
a series of brief interludes and an epilogue. This version ends with the
tinker going home claiming that the play has taught him how to tame a
shrew and thus to handle his own wife. But the tapster knows better:
‘your wife will course [thrash] you for dreaming here tonight’. The
hungover Sly is in no position to tame anybody; he will return home and
be soundly beaten by his wife. Kate’s speech propounds the patriarchal
ideal of marriage, but in A Shrew the Slys’ is a union that reveals this
ideology’s distance from ‘reality’; its implied resolution, with the
woman on top, intimates that ‘real’ housewives are not silent and
obedient, and plays cannot teach husbands to tame them into
submission.</p>
<p>We do not need the epilogue of the anonymously published play to see
that Shakespeare’s ending is more complicated and ironic than first
appears. Having been outwitted in his courtship of Bianca, Hortensio
marries the widow for her money. The latter shows signs of forwardness
and has to be lectured by Kate. The first half of Kate’s famous
submission speech is spoken in the singular, addressed specifically to
the widow and not to womankind in general: ‘Thy husband is thy lord, thy
life, thy keeper, / Thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee.’
The contextual irony of this is not always appreciated: in
contradistinction to Kate’s prescriptions, in this marriage it will be
the wife, the wealthy widow, who provides the ‘maintenance’; Hortensio
will be spared the labours of a breadwinner. According to Kate, all a
husband asks from a wife is love, good looks and obedience; these are
said to be ‘Too little payment for so great a debt.’ But the audience
knows that in this case the debt is all Hortensio’s. Besides, he has
said earlier that he is no longer interested in woman’s traditional
attribute of ‘beauteous looks’ – all he wants is the money. Kate’s
vision of obedience is made to look oddly irrelevant to the very
marriage upon which she is offering advice.</p>
<p>Then there is Kate’s sister. Petruchio’s ‘taming school’ is played
off against the attempts by Lucentio and Hortensio to gain access to
Bianca by disguising themselves as schoolmasters. In the scene in which
Lucentio courts her in the guise of a Latin tutor, the woman gives as
good as she gets. She is happy to flirt with her supposed teacher over
Ovid’s erotic manual The Art of Love . This relationship offers a model
of courtship and marriage built on mutual desire and consent; Bianca
escapes her class of sixteenth-century woman’s usual fate of being
married to a partner of the father’s choice, such as rich old Gremio. If
anything, Bianca is the dominant partner at the end. She is not read a
lecture by Kate, as the widow is, and she gets the better of her husband
in their final on-stage exchange. Like Beatrice in Much Ado about
Nothing , she more than matches her man in the art of wordplay. One
almost wonders if she would not be better matched with the pretended
rather than the ‘real’ Lucentio, that is to say the clever servant
Tranio who oils the wheels of the plot and sometimes threatens to steal
the show.</p>
<p>The double plot is a guarantee that, despite the subduing of Kate,
the play is no uncomplicated apology for shrew-taming. But is Kate
really subdued? Or is her submission all part of the game that she and
Petruchio have been playing out? It is their marriage, not the other
ones, that compels the theatre audience. A woman with Kate’s energies
would be bored by a conventional lover such as Lucentio. She and
Petruchio are well matched because they are both of ‘choleric’
temperament; their fierce tempers are what make them attractive to each
other and charismatic to us. They seem to know they are born for each
other from the moment in their first private encounter when they share a
joke about oral sex (‘with my tongue in your tail’). ‘Where two raging
fires meet together’ there may not be an easy marriage, but there will
certainly not be a dull match and a passive wife. In the twentieth
century the roles seemed ready made for Richard Burton and Elizabeth
Taylor.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Christopher Sly, a beggarly tinker, falls asleep drunk, having
been thrown out of an ale-house. A lord takes him into his house and
plays a trick involving the pretence that Sly is a lord himself, for
whose benefit a company of players will act The Taming of the Shrew .
The main action then commences. Fortune-hunting Hortensio, rich old
Gremio and newly-arrived-in-town Lucentio all wish to court beautiful
Bianca, but she cannot marry before her older sister, shrewish Kate.
Petruchio vows to woo Kate both for her dowry and for the challenge of
overcoming her fearsome reputation. Hortensio and Lucentio gain access
to Bianca by disguising themselves as tutors, while Lucentio’s servant
Tranio plays the role of his master. Petruchio marries Kate – turning up
late wearing the most unsuitable clothes imaginable – and takes her off
to his country house, where he ‘tames’ her through various forms of
deprivation. Tranio persuades a travelling schoolteacher to pretend to
be Lucentio’s father Vincentio in order to give assurance of Lucentio’s
financial means; there is confusion when the real Vincentio turns up,
but the love-match between Lucentio and Bianca is happily settled.
Hortensio marries a wealthy widow and Petruchio and Kate return to
reveal that she is a changed woman.</p>

(3%/29/7), Sly (2%/24/3), Vincentio (2%/23/3), Pedant (2%/20/3).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 80% verse, 20% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: Usually considered to be one of Shakespeare’s earliest works.
Assuming that Quarto The Taming of a Shrew , registered for publication
May 1594, is a version of the text rather than a source for it (see
below), the play is likely to pre-date the long periods of plague
closure that inhibited theatrical activity from summer 1592 onwards, but
there is no firm evidence for a more precise date.</p>
<p>SOURCES: The Induction’s scenario of a beggar transported into luxury
is a traditional motif in ballads and the folk tradition; the shrewish
wife is also common in fabliaux and other forms of popular tale, as well
as classical comedy; Socrates, wisest of the ancients, was supposed to
be married to the shrewish Xanthippe; the courtship of Bianca is
developed from George Gascoigne’s Supposes (1566), itself a prose
translation of Ludovico Ariosto’s I Suppositi (1509), an archetypal
Italian Renaissance comedy suffused with conventions derived from the
ancient Roman comedies of Plautus and Terence. Some scholars suppose
that The Taming of a Shrew (1594) is a badly printed text of an older
play that was Shakespeare’s primary source, but others regard it as an
adaptation of Shakespeare’s work; it includes the Christopher Sly frame,
the taming of Kate (with a differently named tamer) and a highly variant
version of the Bianca sub-plot.</p>
<p>TEXT: The 1623 Folio is the only authoritative text; it seems to have
been set from manuscript copy, possibly a scribal transcript that
retains some of the marks of Shakespeare’s working manuscript. The 1594
Quarto Taming of a Shrew must be regarded as an autonomous work, but it
provides a source for emendations on a few occasions where it
corresponds closely to The Shrew .</p>
