continues</h4>
<p>Enter Viola and Clown [Feste, with a tabor 799 ]</p>
<p>VIOLA Save 800 thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live by 801 thy
tabor?</p>
<p>FESTE No, sir, I live by the church.</p>
<p>VIOLA Art thou a churchman?</p>
<p>FESTE No such matter, sir. I do live by the church, for I do live at
my house, and my house doth stand by the church.</p>
<p>VIOLA So thou mayst say, the king lies by 802 a beggar, if a beggar
dwell near him, or the church stands 803 by thy tabor, if thy tabor
stand 804 by the church.</p>
<p>FESTE You have said 805 , sir. To see this age! A sentence 806 is but
a cheveril 807 glove to a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be
turned outward!</p>
<p>VIOLA Nay, that’s certain. They that dally nicely 808 with words may
quickly make them wanton 809 .</p>
<p>FESTE I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.</p>
<p>VIOLA Why, man?</p>
<p>FESTE Why, sir, her name’s a word, and to dally with that word might
make my sister wanton. But indeed, words are very rascals since bonds
810 disgraced them 811 .</p>
<p>VIOLA Thy reason, man?</p>
<p>FESTE Troth, sir, I can yield 812 you none without words, and words
are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them.</p>
<p>VIOLA I warrant thou art a merry fellow and car’st for nothing.</p>
<p>FESTE Not so, sir, I do care for something. But in my conscience,
sir, I do not care for you: if that be to care for nothing, sir, I would
it would make you invisible.</p>
<p>VIOLA Art not thou the lady Olivia’s fool?</p>
<p>FESTE No, indeed, sir, the lady Olivia has no folly. She will keep no
fool, sir, till she be married, and fools are as like husbands as
pilchards 813 are to herrings: the husband’s the bigger. I am indeed not
her fool, but her corrupter of words.</p>
<p>VIOLA I saw thee late 814 at the count Orsino’s.</p>
<p>FESTE Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb 815 like the sun, it
shines everywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but 816 the fool should be as
oft with your master as with my mistress. I think I saw your wisdom 817
there.</p>
<p>VIOLA Nay, an thou pass upon 818 me, I’ll no more with thee. Hold,
there’s expenses for thee.</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>FESTE Now Jove, in his next commodity 819 of hair, send thee a
beard!</p>
<p>VIOLA By my troth I’ll tell thee, I am almost sick for one 820 —
though I would not have it grow on my chin.— Is thy lady within?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>FESTE Would not a pair of these 821 have bred 822 , sir?</p>
<p>VIOLA Yes, being kept together and put to use 823 .</p>
<p>FESTE I would play Lord Pandarus 824 of Phrygia 825 , sir, to bring a
Cressida to this Troilus.</p>
<p>VIOLA I understand you, sir. ’Tis well begged.</p>
<p>Gives more money</p>
<p>FESTE The matter, I hope, is not great, sir; begging but a beggar 826
. Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will conster 827 to
them whence you come. Who you are and what you would are out of my
welkin 828 829 . I might say ‘element 830’, but the word is
over-worn.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>VIOLA This fellow is wise enough to play the fool,</p>
<p>And to do that well craves 831 a kind of wit:</p>
<p>He must observe their mood on whom he jests,</p>
<p>The quality 832 of persons, and the time,</p>
<p>And, like the haggard 833 , check 834 at every feather</p>
<p>That comes before his eye. This is a practice 835</p>
<p>As full of labour as a wise man’s art,</p>
<p>For folly that he wisely shows is fit 836 ;</p>
<p>But wise men, folly-fall’n 837 , quite taint their wit.</p>
<p>Enter Sir Toby and Andrew</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Save you, gentleman.</p>
<p>VIOLA And you, sir.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Dieu vous garde, monsieur 838 .</p>
<p>VIOLA Et vous aussi. Votre serviteur 839 .</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Will you encounter 840 the house? My niece is desirous you
should enter, if your trade 841 be to 842 her.</p>
<p>VIOLA I am bound to 843 your niece, sir. I mean she is the list 844
of my voyage.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Taste 845 your legs, sir, put them to motion.</p>
<p>VIOLA My legs do better understand 846 me, sir, than I understand
what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY I mean, to go, sir, to enter.</p>
<p>VIOLA I will answer you with gait and entrance 847 . But we are
prevented 848 .</p>
<p>Enter Olivia and Gentlewoman [Maria ]</p>
<p>Most excellent accomplished lady, the 849 heavens rain odours 850 on
you!</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW That youth’s a rare courtier. ‘Rain odours’, well.</p>
<p>To Toby</p>
<p>VIOLA My matter hath no voice 851 , lady, but to your own most
pregnant 852 and vouchsafed 853 ear.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW ‘Odours,’ ‘pregnant’ and ‘vouchsafed’. I’ll get ’em all
three all ready 854 .</p>
<p>To Toby</p>
<p>OLIVIA Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing 855
.—</p>
<p>[Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Maria ]</p>
<p>Give me your hand, sir.</p>
<p>VIOLA My duty, madam, and most humble service.</p>
<p>OLIVIA What is your name?</p>
<p>VIOLA Cesario is your servant’s name, fair princess.</p>
<p>OLIVIA My servant, sir? ’Twas never merry world 856</p>
<p>Since lowly feigning 857 was called compliment 858 .</p>
<p>You’re servant to the count Orsino, youth.</p>
<p>VIOLA And he is yours 859 , and his 860 must needs be yours:</p>
<p>Your servant’s servant is your servant, madam.</p>
<p>OLIVIA For 861 him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,</p>
<p>Would they were blanks 862 , rather than filled with me!</p>
<p>VIOLA Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts</p>
<p>On his behalf.</p>
<p>OLIVIA O, by your leave, I pray you.</p>
<p>I bade you never speak again of him;</p>
<p>But, would you undertake another suit 863 ,</p>
<p>I had rather hear you to solicit 864 that</p>
<p>Than music from the spheres 865 .</p>
<p>VIOLA Dear lady—</p>
<p>OLIVIA Give me leave 866 , beseech you. I did send,</p>
<p>After the last enchantment you did here,</p>
<p>A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse 867</p>
<p>Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you.</p>
<p>Under your hard construction 868 must I sit,</p>
<p>To force 869 that on you, in a shameful cunning,</p>
<p>Which you knew none of yours. What might you think?</p>
<p>Have you not set mine honour at the stake 870</p>
<p>And baited it with all th’unmuzzled thoughts</p>
<p>That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving 871</p>
<p>Enough is shown: a cypress 872 , not a bosom,</p>
<p>Hides my heart. So, let me hear you speak.</p>
<p>VIOLA I pity you.</p>
<p>OLIVIA That’s a degree 873 to love.</p>
<p>VIOLA No, not a grize 874 , for ’tis a vulgar proof 875 ,</p>
<p>That very oft we pity enemies.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Why, then, methinks ’tis time to smile again 876 .</p>
<p>O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!</p>
<p>If one should be a prey, how much the better</p>
<p>To fall before the lion 877 than the wolf!</p>
<p>Clock strikes</p>
<p>The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.</p>
<p>Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:</p>
<p>And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,</p>
<p>Your wife is like to reap a proper 878 man.</p>
<p>There lies your way, due west.</p>
<p>VIOLA Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition 879</p>
<p>Attend your ladyship!</p>
<p>You’ll 880 nothing, madam, to my lord by me?</p>
<p>OLIVIA Stay.</p>
<p>I prithee tell me what thou think’st of me.</p>
<p>VIOLA That you do think you are not what you are 881 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA If I think so, I think the same of you.</p>
<p>VIOLA Then think you right: I am not what I am.</p>
<p>OLIVIA I would you were as I would have you be.</p>
<p>VIOLA Would it be better, madam, than I am?</p>
<p>I wish it might, for now I am your fool 882 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA O, what a deal 883 of scorn looks beautiful</p>
<p>In the contempt and anger of his lip!</p>
<p>A murd’rous guilt shows not itself more soon</p>
<p>Than love that would seem hid: love’s night is noon 884 .</p>
<p>Cesario, by the roses of the spring,</p>
<p>By maidhood 885 , honour, truth and everything,</p>
<p>I love thee so that, maugre 886 all thy pride,</p>
<p>Nor 887 wit nor reason can my passion hide.</p>
<p>Do not extort thy reasons from this clause 888 ,</p>
<p>For that 889 I woo, thou therefore hast no cause 890 ,</p>
<p>But rather reason thus with reason fetter 891 :</p>
<p>Love sought is good, but given unsought is better.</p>
<p>VIOLA By innocence I swear, and by my youth,</p>
<p>I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,</p>
<p>And that no woman has, nor never none</p>
<p>Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.</p>
<p>And so adieu, good madam. Never more</p>
<p>Will I my master’s tears to you deplore 892 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move</p>
<p>That heart which now abhors, to like his love.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
