19</h4>
<p>Enter Menenius to the Watch or Guard</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN Stay: whence are you?</p>
<p>SECOND WATCHMANN Stand, and go back.</p>
<p>MENENIUS You guard like men: ’tis well.</p>
<p>But, by your leave, I am an officer</p>
<p>Of state, and come to speak with Coriolanus.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN From whence?</p>
<p>MENENIUS From Rome.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN You may not pass, you must return: our general will no
more hear from thence.</p>
<p>SECOND WATCHMANN You’ll see your Rome embraced with fire before
you’ll speak with Coriolanus.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Good my friends,</p>
<p>If you have heard your general talk of Rome,</p>
<p>And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks 1656 ,</p>
<p>My name hath touched your ears: it is Menenius.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN Be it so: go back: the virtue 1657 of your name is not
here passable 1658 .</p>
<p>MENENIUS I tell thee, fellow,</p>
<p>The general is my lover 1659 : I have been</p>
<p>The book 1660 of his good acts, whence men have read</p>
<p>His fame unparalleled, happily 1661 amplified:</p>
<p>For I have ever verified 1662 my friends,</p>
<p>Of whom he’s chief, with all the size 1663 that verity 1664</p>
<p>Would without lapsing suffer 1665 : nay, sometimes,</p>
<p>Like to a bowl 1666 upon a subtle 1667 ground,</p>
<p>I have tumbled past the throw 1668 : and in his praise</p>
<p>Have almost stamped the leasing 1669 . Therefore, fellow,</p>
<p>I must have leave to pass.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf
as you have uttered words in your own, you should not pass here: no,
though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely 1670 . Therefore,
go back.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, always
factionary 1671 on the party of your general.</p>
<p>SECOND WATCHMANN Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
have, I am one that, telling true under 1672 him, must say you cannot
pass. Therefore, go back.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Has he dined, canst thou tell? For I would not speak with
him till after dinner.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN You are a Roman, are you?</p>
<p>MENENIUS I am as thy general is.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you, when
you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them, and in a
violent popular</p>
<p>ignorance 1673 , given your enemy your shield 1674 , think to front
1675 his revenges with the easy 1676 groans of old women, the virginal
palms 1677 of your daughters, or with the palsied 1678 intercession of
such a decayed dotant 1679 as you seem to be? Can you think to blow out
the intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with such weak breath
as this? No, you are deceived: therefore back to Rome, and prepare for
your execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn you out of 1680
reprieve and pardon.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Sirrah 1681 , if thy captain knew I were here, he would use
1682 me with estimation 1683 .</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN Come, my captain knows you not.</p>
<p>MENENIUS I mean, thy general.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go: lest I
let forth your half-pint of blood. Back: that’s the utmost of your
having 1684 : back.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Nay, but fellow, fellow—</p>
<p>Enter Coriolanus with Aufidius</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS What’s the matter?</p>
<p>MENENIUS Now, you companion 1685 , I’ll say an errand for 1686 you:
you shall know now that I am in estimation: you shall perceive that a
jack guardant 1687 cannot office 1688 me from my son Coriolanus: guess
but my entertainment 1689 with him: if thou stand’st not i’th’state of
1690 hanging, or of some death more long in spectatorship 1691 , and
crueller in suffering, behold now presently, and swoon for what’s to
come upon thee.— The glorious gods sit in hourly synod 1692 about thy
particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old father
Menenius does! O my son, my son! Thou art preparing fire for us: look
thee, here’s water to quench it. I was hardly moved 1693 to come to
thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee, I have been
blown out of our gates with sighs, and conjure 1694 thee to pardon Rome,
and thy petitionary 1695 countrymen. The good gods assuage thy wrath,
and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet 1696 here: this, who like a
block 1697 hath denied my access to thee.</p>
<p>To First Watchman</p>
<p>To Coriolanus</p>
<p>He weeps</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Away!</p>
<p>MENENIUS How? Away?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs</p>
<p>Are servanted 1698 to others: though I owe 1699</p>
<p>My revenge properly 1700 , my remission 1701 lies</p>
<p>In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,</p>
<p>Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather</p>
<p>Than pity note how much 1702 . Therefore, be gone.</p>
<p>Mine ears against your suits are stronger than</p>
<p>Your gates against my force. Yet, for 1703 I loved thee,</p>
<p>Take this along: I writ it for thy sake,</p>
<p>He gives him a letter</p>
<p>And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius,</p>
<p>I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,</p>
<p>Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold’st.</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS You keep a constant temper 1704 .</p>
<p>Exeunt [Coriolanus and Aufidius ]</p>
<p>The Guard and Menenius [remain ]</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN Now, sir, is your name Menenius?</p>
<p>SECOND WATCHMANN ’Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the
way home again.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN Do you hear how we are shent 1705 for keeping your
greatness back?</p>
<p>SECOND WATCHMANN What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?</p>
<p>MENENIUS I neither care for 1706 th’world nor your general: for such
things as you, I can scarce think there’s any, you’re so slight 1707 .
He that hath a will to die by himself 1708 fears it not from another:
let your general do his worst. For you, be that you are long 1709 , and
your misery increase with your age. I say to you, as I was said
to,‘Away!’</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN A noble fellow, I warrant him.</p>
<p>SECOND WATCHMANN The worthy fellow is our general. He’s the rock, the
oak not to be wind-shaken.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
