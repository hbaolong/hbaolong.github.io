continues</h4>
<p>Enter Kent</p>
<p>Disguised</p>
<p>KENT If but as will 325 I other accents borrow,</p>
<p>That can my speech defuse 326 , my good intent</p>
<p>May carry through itself to that full issue 327</p>
<p>For which I razed my likeness 328 . Now, banished Kent,</p>
<p>If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned,</p>
<p>So may it come thy master whom thou lov’st,</p>
<p>Shall find thee full of labours.</p>
<p>Horns within. Enter Lear and Attendants [his Knights ]</p>
<p>LEAR Let me not stay 329 a jot for dinner: go get it ready.—</p>
<p>[Exit a Knight ]</p>
<p>How now, what art thou?</p>
<p>To Kent</p>
<p>KENT A man, sir.</p>
<p>LEAR What dost thou profess 330 ? What wouldst thou 331 with us 332
?</p>
<p>KENT I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve him truly that
will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to converse with him
that is wise and says little, to fear judgement 333 , to fight when I
cannot choose 334 and to eat no fish 335 .</p>
<p>LEAR What art thou?</p>
<p>KENT A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.</p>
<p>LEAR If thou be’st as poor for a subject as he’s for a king, thou art
poor enough. What wouldst thou?</p>
<p>KENT Service.</p>
<p>LEAR Who wouldst thou serve?</p>
<p>KENT You.</p>
<p>LEAR Dost thou know me, fellow?</p>
<p>KENT No, sir, but you have that in your countenance which I would
fain call master.</p>
<p>LEAR What’s that?</p>
<p>KENT Authority.</p>
<p>LEAR What services canst thou do?</p>
<p>KENT I can keep honest counsel 336 , ride, run, mar a curious tale
337 in telling it, and deliver a plain message bluntly: that which
ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of me is
diligence.</p>
<p>LEAR How old art thou?</p>
<p>KENT Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to
dote on her for anything 338 : I have years on my back forty-eight.</p>
<p>LEAR Follow me, thou shalt serve me: if I like thee no worse after
dinner, I will not part from thee yet.— Dinner, ho, dinner! Where’s my
knave 339 ? My fool? Go you and call my fool hither.</p>
<p>[Exit another Knight ]</p>
<p>Enter Steward [Oswald ]</p>
<p>You, you, sirrah, where’s my daughter?</p>
<p>OSWALD So 340 please you—</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>LEAR What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll 341 back.—</p>
<p>[Exit another Knight ]</p>
<p>Where’s my fool? Ho, I think the world’s asleep.—</p>
<p>[Enter a Knight ]</p>
<p>How now? Where’s that mongrel?</p>
<p>KNIGH He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.</p>
<p>LEAR Why came not the slave 342 back to me when I called him?</p>
<p>KNIGH Sir, he answered me in the roundest 343 manner, he would
not.</p>
<p>LEAR He would not?</p>
<p>KNIGH My lord, I know not what the matter is, but to my judgement
your highness is not entertained 344 with that ceremonious affection as
you were wont 345 : there’s a great abatement of kindness appears as
well in the general dependants 346 as in the duke himself also and your
daughter.</p>
<p>LEAR Ha? Say’st thou so?</p>
<p>KNIGH I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken, for my duty
cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged.</p>
<p>LEAR Thou but rememb’rest 347 me of mine own conception 348 : I have
perceived a most faint 349 neglect of late, which I have rather blamed
as mine own jealous curiosity 350 than as a very pretence 351 and
purpose of unkindness. I will look further into’t. But where’s my fool?
I have not seen him this two days.</p>
<p>KNIGH Since my young lady’s going into France, sir, the fool hath
much pined away.</p>
<p>LEAR No more of that, I have noted it well.— Go you and tell my
daughter I would speak with her.—</p>
<p>[Exit a Knight ]</p>
<p>Go you, call hither 352 my fool.—</p>
<p>[Exit another Knight ]</p>
<p>Enter Steward [Oswald ]</p>
<p>O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?</p>
<p>OSWALD My lady’s father.</p>
<p>LEAR ‘My lady’s father’? My lord’s knave: you whoreson dog, you
slave, you cur 353 !</p>
<p>OSWALD I am none of these, my lord, I beseech your pardon.</p>
<p>LEAR Do you bandy 354 looks with me, you rascal?</p>
<p>Strikes him</p>
<p>OSWALD I’ll not be strucken 355 , my lord.</p>
<p>KENT Nor tripped neither, you base football 356 player.</p>
<p>Trips him</p>
<p>LEAR I thank thee, fellow: thou serv’st me and I’ll love thee.</p>
<p>KENT Come, sir, arise, away! I’ll teach you differences 357 : away,
away! If you will measure your lubber’s 358 length 359 again, tarry 360
: but away, go to 361 . Have you wisdom? So.</p>
<p>Pushes Oswald out</p>
<p>LEAR Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There’s earnest 362 of thy
service.</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>Enter Fool</p>
<p>FOOL Let me hire him too: here’s my coxcomb 363 .</p>
<p>Offers Kent his cap</p>
<p>LEAR How now, my pretty 364 knave, how dost thou?</p>
<p>FOOL Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.</p>
<p>To Kent</p>
<p>LEAR Why, my boy?</p>
<p>FOOL Why? For taking one’s part that’s out of favour: nay, an thou
canst not smile as the wind sits 365 , thou’lt catch cold shortly.
There, take my coxcomb. Why, this fellow has banished two on’s 366
daughters and did the third a blessing against his will: if thou follow
him, thou must needs 367 wear my coxcomb.— How now, nuncle 368 ? Would
369 I had two coxcombs and two daughters.</p>
<p>LEAR Why, my boy?</p>
<p>FOOL If I gave them all my living 370 , I’d keep my coxcombs
myself.</p>
<p>There’s mine: beg another of thy daughters.</p>
<p>LEAR Take heed, sirrah: the whip.</p>
<p>FOOL Truth’s a dog must to kennel: he must be whipped out when the
Lady Brach 371 may stand by th’fire and stink.</p>
<p>LEAR A pestilent gall 372 to me!</p>
<p>FOOL Sirrah, I’ll teach thee a speech.</p>
<p>LEAR Do.</p>
<p>FOOL Mark 373 it, nuncle:</p>
<p>Have more than thou showest,</p>
<p>Speak less than thou knowest,</p>
<p>Lend less than thou owest 374 ,</p>
<p>Ride more than thou goest 375 ,</p>
<p>Learn more than thou trowest 376 ,</p>
<p>Set less than thou throwest 377 ;</p>
<p>Leave thy drink and thy whore,</p>
<p>And keep in-a-door,</p>
<p>And thou shalt have more</p>
<p>Than two tens to a score 378 .</p>
<p>KENT This is nothing, fool.</p>
<p>FOOL Then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d 379 lawyer: you gave me
nothing for’t.—</p>
<p>To Lear</p>
<p>Can you make no use 380 of nothing, nuncle?</p>
<p>LEAR Why, no, boy: nothing can be made out of nothing.</p>
<p>FOOL Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land comes to: he will
not believe a fool.</p>
<p>To Kent</p>
<p>LEAR A bitter fool!</p>
<p>FOOL Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and
a sweet one?</p>
<p>LEAR No, lad, teach me.</p>
<p>FOOL Nuncle, give me an egg and I’ll give thee two crowns 381 .</p>
<p>LEAR What two crowns shall they be?</p>
<p>FOOL Why, after I have cut the egg i’th’middle and eat up the meat
382 , the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest 383 thy crowns
i’th’middle and gav’st away both parts, thou bor’st thine ass on thy
back o’er the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou
gav’st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself 384 in this, let him
be whipped that first finds it so:</p>
<p>Fools had ne’er less grace 385 in a year,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>For wise men are grown foppish 386</p>
<p>And know not how their wits to wear,</p>
<p>Their manners are so apish 387 .</p>
<p>LEAR When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?</p>
<p>FOOL I have used it 388 , nuncle, e’er since thou mad’st thy
daughters thy mothers: for when thou gav’st them the rod 389 and put’st
down thine own breeches,</p>
<p>Then they for sudden joy did weep,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>And I for sorrow sung,</p>
<p>That such a king should play bo-peep 390</p>
<p>And go the fool among 391 .</p>
<p>Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie:
I would fain 392 learn to lie.</p>
<p>LEAR An 393 you lie, sirrah, we’ll have you whipped.</p>
<p>FOOL I marvel 394 what kin thou and thy daughters are: they’ll have
me whipped for speaking true, thou’lt have me whipped for lying, and
sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any kind
o’thing than a fool. And yet I would not be thee, nuncle: thou hast
pared 395 thy wit o’both sides and left nothing i’th’middle. Here comes
one o’the parings.</p>
<p>Enter Goneril</p>
<p>LEAR How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet 396 on? You are too
much of late i’th’frown.</p>
<p>FOOL Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for
her frowning: now thou art an O without a figure 397 . I am better than
thou art now: I am a fool, thou art nothing.— Yes, forsooth 398 , I will
hold my tongue, so your face bids me, though you say nothing.</p>
<p>To Goneril</p>
<p>Mum, mum,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>He that keeps nor crust nor crumb 399 ,</p>
<p>Weary of all, shall want some 400 .</p>
<p>That’s a shelled peascod 401 .</p>
<p>Points to Lear</p>
<p>GONERIL Not only, sir, this your all-licensed 402 fool,</p>
<p>But other of your insolent retinue</p>
<p>Do hourly carp 403 and quarrel, breaking forth</p>
<p>In rank 404 and not-to-be endured riots, sir.</p>
<p>I had thought by making this well known unto you</p>
<p>To have found a safe 405 redress, but now grow fearful,</p>
<p>By what yourself too late 406 have spoke and done.</p>
<p>That you protect this course 407 and put it on 408</p>
<p>By your allowance, which if you should, the fault</p>
<p>Would not scape 409 censure, nor the redresses sleep 410</p>
<p>Which in the tender of a wholesome weal</p>
<p>Might in their working do you that offence,</p>
<p>Which else were shame, that then necessity</p>
<p>Will call discreet proceeding 411 .</p>
<p>FOOL For you know, nuncle,</p>
<p>The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo 412 so long,</p>
<p>That it’s had it 413 head bit off by it young 414 .</p>
<p>So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling 415 .</p>
<p>LEAR Are you our daughter?</p>
<p>To Goneril</p>
<p>GONERIL I would you would make use of your good wisdom —</p>
<p>Whereof I know you are fraught 416 — and put away</p>
<p>These dispositions 417 which of late transport you</p>
<p>From what you rightly are.</p>
<p>FOOL May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?</p>
<p>Whoop, Jug 418 ! I love thee.</p>
<p>LEAR Does any here know me? This is not Lear.</p>
<p>Does Lear walk thus? Speak thus? Where are his eyes?</p>
<p>Either his notion 419 weakens, his discernings</p>
<p>Are lethargied 420 — Ha! Waking 421 ? ’Tis not so?</p>
<p>Who is it that can tell me who I am?</p>
<p>FOOL Lear’s shadow 422 .</p>
<p>LEAR Your name, fair gentlewoman?</p>
<p>GONERIL This admiration 423 , sir, is much o’th’savour 424</p>
<p>Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you</p>
<p>To understand my purposes aright:</p>
<p>As you are old and reverend, should 425 be wise.</p>
<p>Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires,</p>
<p>Men so disordered, so debauched and bold 426 ,</p>
<p>That this our court, infected with their manners,</p>
<p>Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism 427 and lust</p>
<p>Makes it more like a tavern or a brothel</p>
<p>Than a graced 428 palace. The shame itself doth speak 429</p>
<p>For instant remedy. Be then desired 430</p>
<p>By her, that else will take the thing she begs,</p>
<p>A little to disquantity your train 431 ,</p>
<p>And the remainders, that shall still depend 432</p>
<p>To be such men as may besort 433 your age,</p>
<p>Which know themselves and you 434 .</p>
<p>LEAR Darkness and devils!—</p>
<p>Saddle my horses, call my train together.—</p>
<p>To a Servant</p>
<p>Degenerate 435 bastard! I’ll not trouble thee.</p>
<p>To Goneril</p>
<p>Yet have I left a daughter.</p>
<p>GONERIL You strike my people, and your disordered rabble</p>
<p>Make servants of their betters.</p>
<p>Enter Albany</p>
<p>LEAR Woe that 436 too late repents!— Is it your will?</p>
<p>To Albany</p>
<p>Speak, sir.— Prepare my horses.</p>
<p>To a Servant</p>
<p>Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,</p>
<p>More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child</p>
<p>Than the sea-monster!</p>
<p>ALBANY Pray, sir, be patient.</p>
<p>LEAR Detested kite 437 , thou liest.</p>
<p>To Goneril</p>
<p>My train are men of choice and rarest parts 438 ,</p>
<p>That all particulars of duty know</p>
<p>And in the most exact regard support</p>
<p>The worships of their name 439 . O, most small fault,</p>
<p>How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!</p>
<p>Which, like an engine 440 , wrenched my frame of nature</p>
<p>From the fixed place, drew from my heart all love,</p>
<p>And added to the gall 441 . O Lear, Lear, Lear!</p>
<p>Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,</p>
<p>Hits his head</p>
<p>And thy dear judgement out!— Go, go, my people.</p>
<p>ALBANY My lord, I am guiltless as I am ignorant</p>
<p>Of what hath moved 442 you.</p>
<p>LEAR It may be so, my lord.—</p>
<p>Hear, nature, hear, dear goddess, hear!</p>
<p>Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend</p>
<p>To make this creature fruitful:</p>
<p>Into her womb convey sterility,</p>
<p>Dry up in her the organs of increase 443 ,</p>
<p>And from her derogate 444 body never spring</p>
<p>A babe to honour her: if she must teem 445 ,</p>
<p>Create her child of spleen 446 , that it may live</p>
<p>And be a thwart 447 disnatured 448 torment to her:</p>
<p>Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,</p>
<p>With cadent 449 tears fret 450 channels in her cheeks,</p>
<p>Turn all her mother’s pains 451 and benefits 452</p>
<p>To laughter and contempt, that she may feel</p>
<p>How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is</p>
<p>To have a thankless child!— Away, away!</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Perhaps with Kent and Knights</p>
<p>ALBANY Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?</p>
<p>GONERIL Never afflict yourself to know more of it,</p>
<p>But let his disposition have that scope</p>
<p>As dotage 453 gives it.</p>
<p>Enter Lear</p>
<p>LEAR What, fifty of my followers at a clap 454 ?</p>
<p>Within a fortnight?</p>
<p>ALBANY What’s the matter, sir?</p>
<p>LEAR I’ll tell thee:— Life and death! I am ashamed</p>
<p>To Goneril</p>
<p>That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus,</p>
<p>That these hot tears, which break from me perforce 455 ,</p>
<p>Should make thee worth them. Blasts 456 and fogs upon thee!</p>
<p>Th’untented 457 woundings of a father’s curse</p>
<p>Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond 458 eyes,</p>
<p>Beweep this cause again, I’ll pluck ye out</p>
<p>And cast you, with the waters that you loose 459 ,</p>
<p>To temper 460 clay 461 . Ha? Let it be so.</p>
<p>I have another daughter,</p>
<p>Who, I am sure, is kind 462 and comfortable 463 :</p>
<p>When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails</p>
<p>She’ll flay thy wolvish visage 464 . Thou shalt find</p>
<p>That I’ll resume the shape which thou dost think</p>
<p>I have cast off for ever.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Lear, perhaps with Kent and Knights ]</p>
<p>GONERIL Do you mark that?</p>
<p>ALBANY I cannot be so partial 465 , Goneril,</p>
<p>To the great love I bear you—</p>
<p>GONERIL Pray you, content 466 .— What, Oswald, ho!—</p>
<p>You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.</p>
<p>To Fool</p>
<p>FOOL Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry, take the fool with thee.</p>
<p>A fox, when one has caught her,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>And such a daughter</p>
<p>Should sure to the slaughter,</p>
<p>If my cap would buy a halter 467 :</p>
<p>So the fool follows after.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>GONERIL This man hath had good counsel. A hundred knights?</p>
<p>’Tis politic 468 and safe to let him keep</p>
<p>At point 469 a hundred knights: yes, that 470 on every dream,</p>
<p>Each buzz 471 , each fancy 472 , each complaint, dislike,</p>
<p>He may enguard 473 his dotage with their powers</p>
<p>And hold our lives in 474 mercy.— Oswald, I say!</p>
<p>ALBANY Well, you may fear too far.</p>
<p>GONERIL Safer than trust too far:</p>
<p>Let me still 475 take away the harms I fear,</p>
<p>Not fear still to be taken 476 . I know his heart.</p>
<p>What he hath uttered I have writ my sister:</p>
<p>If she sustain him and his hundred knights</p>
<p>When I have showed th’unfitness—</p>
<p>Enter Steward [Oswald ]</p>
<p>How now, Oswald?</p>
<p>What, have you writ that letter to my sister?</p>
<p>OSWALD Ay, madam.</p>
<p>GONERIL Take you some company and away to horse:</p>
<p>Inform her full of my particular fear,</p>
<p>And thereto add such reasons of your own</p>
<p>As may compact 477 it more. Get you gone,</p>
<p>And hasten your return.—</p>
<p>[Exit Oswald ]</p>
<p>No, no, my lord,</p>
<p>This milky gentleness and course of yours</p>
<p>Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon 478 ,</p>
<p>You are much more at task 479 for want of wisdom</p>
<p>Than praised for harmful mildness.</p>
<p>ALBANY How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell:</p>
<p>Striving to better, oft we mar what’s well.</p>
<p>GONERIL Nay, then—</p>
<p>ALBANY Well, well, th’event 480 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
