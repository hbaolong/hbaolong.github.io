<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-2">Scene 1 / running scene 2</h4>
<p>Enter Hermione, Mamillius, Ladies</p>
<p>HERMIONE Take the boy to you. He so troubles me,</p>
<p>’Tis past enduring.</p>
<p>FIRST LADY Come, my gracious lord,</p>
<p>Takes Mamillius</p>
<p>Shall I be your playfellow?</p>
<p>MAMILLIUS No, I’ll none of 343 you.</p>
<p>FIRST LADY Why, my sweet lord?</p>
<p>MAMILLIUS You’ll kiss me hard and speak to me as if</p>
<p>I were a baby still.— I love you better.</p>
<p>To Second Lady</p>
<p>SECOND LADY And why so, my lord?</p>
<p>MAMILLIUS Not for because 344</p>
<p>Your brows are blacker — yet black brows, they say,</p>
<p>Become some women best, so 345 that there be not</p>
<p>Too much hair there, but in a semicircle</p>
<p>Or a half-moon made with a pen.</p>
<p>SECOND LADY Who taught ’this 346 ?</p>
<p>MAMILLIUS I learned it out of women’s faces. Pray now</p>
<p>What colour are your eyebrows?</p>
<p>FIRST LADY Blue, my lord.</p>
<p>MAMILLIUS Nay, that’s a mock. I have seen a lady’s nose</p>
<p>That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.</p>
<p>FIRST LADY Hark ye.</p>
<p>The queen your mother rounds apace 347 . We shall</p>
<p>Present our services to a fine new prince</p>
<p>One of these days, and then you’d wanton with us 348 ,</p>
<p>If we would have you.</p>
<p>SECOND LADY She is spread of late</p>
<p>Into a goodly bulk. Good time encounter her! 349</p>
<p>HERMIONE What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now</p>
<p>I am for 350 you again. Pray you sit by us,</p>
<p>And tell’s a tale.</p>
<p>MAMILLIUS Merry or sad 351 shall’t be?</p>
<p>HERMIONE As merry as you will.</p>
<p>MAMILLIUS A sad tale’s best for winter. I have one</p>
<p>Of sprites 352 and goblins.</p>
<p>HERMIONE Let’s have that, good sir.</p>
<p>Come on, sit down. Come on, and do your best</p>
<p>To fright me with your sprites. You’re powerful at it.</p>
<p>MAMILLIUS There was a man—</p>
<p>HERMIONE Nay, come, sit down, then on.</p>
<p>MAMILLIUS Dwelt by a churchyard — I will tell it softly.</p>
<p>Sits</p>
<p>Yond crickets 353 shall not hear it.</p>
<p>HERMIONE Come on, then, and give’t me in mine ear.</p>
<p>They talk apart</p>
<p>[Enter Leontes, Antigonus, Lords and others ]</p>
<p>LEONTES Was he met there? His train? Camillo with him?</p>
<p>A LORD Behind the tuft 354 of pines I met them. Never</p>
<p>Saw I men scour 355 so on their way: I eyed them</p>
<p>Even 356 to their ships.</p>
<p>LEONTES How blest am I</p>
<p>In my just censure 357 , in my true opinion!</p>
<p>Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accursed</p>
<p>In being so blest! There may be in the cup</p>
<p>A spider steeped 358 , and one may drink, depart,</p>
<p>And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge</p>
<p>Is not infected 359 : but if one present</p>
<p>Th’abhorred ingredient to his eye, make known</p>
<p>How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge 360 , his sides,</p>
<p>With violent hefts 361 . I have drunk 362 , and seen the spider.</p>
<p>Camillo was his help in this, his pander 363 .</p>
<p>There is a plot against my life, my crown.</p>
<p>All’s true that is mistrusted 364 . That false 365 villain</p>
<p>Whom I employed was pre-employed by him.</p>
<p>He has discovered my design, and I</p>
<p>Remain a pinched 366 thing; yea, a very trick 367</p>
<p>For them to play at will. How came the posterns</p>
<p>So easily open?</p>
<p>A LORD By his great authority,</p>
<p>Which often hath no less prevailed than so</p>
<p>On your command.</p>
<p>LEONTES I know’t too well.—</p>
<p>Give me the boy. I am glad you did not nurse 368 him.</p>
<p>To Hermione</p>
<p>Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you</p>
<p>Have too much blood in him.</p>
<p>HERMIONE What is this? Sport? 369</p>
<p>LEONTES Bear the boy hence. He shall not come about her.</p>
<p>To a Lord or Lady</p>
<p>Away with him, and let her sport 370 herself</p>
<p>With that she’s big with,— for ’tis Polixenes</p>
<p>To Hermione</p>
<p>Has made thee swell thus.</p>
<p>[The Lord or Lady exits with Mamillius ]</p>
<p>HERMIONE But I’d say he had not;</p>
<p>And I’ll be sworn you would believe my saying,</p>
<p>Howe’er you lean to th’nayward 371 .</p>
<p>LEONTES You, my lords,</p>
<p>Look on her, mark her well. Be but about</p>
<p>To say ‘She is a goodly lady’, and</p>
<p>The justice 372 of your hearts will thereto add</p>
<p>‘’Tis pity she’s not honest 373 , honourable.’</p>
<p>Praise her but for this her without-door 374 form,</p>
<p>Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight 375</p>
<p>The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands 376</p>
<p>That calumny 377 doth use — O, I am out 378 —</p>
<p>That mercy does, for calumny will sear</p>
<p>Virtue itself 379 : these shrugs, these hums and ha’s,</p>
<p>When you have said ‘She’s goodly’, come between 380</p>
<p>Ere you can say ‘She’s honest.’ But be’t known,</p>
<p>From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,</p>
<p>She’s an adultress.</p>
<p>HERMIONE Should a villain say so —</p>
<p>The most replenished 381 villain in the world —</p>
<p>He were as much more villain 382 . You, my lord,</p>
<p>Do but mistake.</p>
<p>LEONTES You have mistook 383 , my lady,</p>
<p>Polixenes for Leontes. O thou thing,</p>
<p>Which I’ll not call a creature of thy place 384 ,</p>
<p>Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,</p>
<p>Should a like 385 language use to all degrees 386</p>
<p>And mannerly distinguishment 387 leave out</p>
<p>Betwixt the prince and beggar. I have said</p>
<p>She’s an adult’ress. I have said with whom.</p>
<p>More, she’s a traitor and Camillo is</p>
<p>A federary 388 with her, and one that knows</p>
<p>What she should shame to know 389 herself</p>
<p>But with her most vile principal, that she’s</p>
<p>A bed-swerver 390 , even as bad as those</p>
<p>That vulgars 391 give bold’st titles 392 ; ay, and privy</p>
<p>To this their late escape.</p>
<p>HERMIONE No, by my life,</p>
<p>Privy to 393 none of this. How will this grieve you,</p>
<p>When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that</p>
<p>You thus have published 394 me. Gentle my 395 lord,</p>
<p>You scarce can right me throughly 396 then to say 397</p>
<p>You did mistake.</p>
<p>LEONTES No. If I mistake</p>
<p>In those foundations which I build upon,</p>
<p>The centre 398 is not big enough to bear</p>
<p>A school-boy’s top 399 . Away with her, to prison!</p>
<p>He who shall speak for her is afar off 400 guilty</p>
<p>But that he speaks 401 .</p>
<p>HERMIONE There’s some ill 402 planet reigns:</p>
<p>I must be patient till the heavens look</p>
<p>With an aspect 403 more favourable. Good my lords,</p>
<p>I am not prone to weeping — as our sex</p>
<p>Commonly are — the want 404 of which vain dew</p>
<p>Perchance shall dry your pities 405 : but I have</p>
<p>That honourable grief lodged here 406 which burns</p>
<p>Worse than tears drown. Beseech you all, my lords,</p>
<p>With thoughts so qualified 407 as your charities 408</p>
<p>Shall best instruct you, measure 409 me; and so</p>
<p>The king’s will be performed.</p>
<p>LEONTES Shall I be heard 410 ?</p>
<p>HERMIONE Who is’t that goes with me? Beseech your highness</p>
<p>My women may be with me, for you see</p>
<p>My plight 411 requires it. Do not weep, good fools.</p>
<p>There is no cause. When you shall know your mistress</p>
<p>Has deserved prison, then abound in tears</p>
<p>As I come out; this action I now go on</p>
<p>Is for my better grace 412 .— Adieu, my lord.</p>
<p>To Leontes</p>
<p>I never wished to see you sorry, now</p>
<p>I trust I shall.— My women, come, you have leave 413 .</p>
<p>LEONTES Go, do our bidding. Hence!</p>
<p>[Exit Hermione, guarded, with Ladies ]</p>
<p>A LORD Beseech your highness, call the queen again.</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice</p>
<p>Prove violence, in the which three great ones suffer:</p>
<p>Yourself, your queen, your son.</p>
<p>A LORD For her, my lord,</p>
<p>I dare my life lay down and will do’t, sir,</p>
<p>Please you t’accept it, that the queen is spotless</p>
<p>I’th’eyes of heaven and to you — I mean,</p>
<p>In this which you accuse her.</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS If it prove</p>
<p>She’s otherwise, I’ll keep my stables where</p>
<p>I lodge my wife 414 , I’ll go in couples 415 with her,</p>
<p>Than when I feel and see her 416 no further trust her,</p>
<p>For every inch of woman in the world,</p>
<p>Ay, every dram 417 of woman’s flesh is false,</p>
<p>If she be.</p>
<p>LEONTES Hold your peaces.</p>
<p>A LORD Good my lord—</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS It is for you we speak, not for ourselves.</p>
<p>You are abused and by some putter-on 418</p>
<p>That will be damned for’t. Would I knew the villain,</p>
<p>I would land-damn 419 him. Be she honour-flawed,</p>
<p>I have three daughters — the eldest is eleven</p>
<p>The second and the third, nine, and some 420 five —</p>
<p>If this prove true, they’ll pay for’t. By mine honour,</p>
<p>I’ll geld 421 ’em all: fourteen they shall not see,</p>
<p>To bring false generations 422 . They are co-heirs,</p>
<p>And I had rather glib 423 myself than they</p>
<p>Should not produce fair issue 424 .</p>
<p>LEONTES Cease. No more.</p>
<p>You smell this business with a sense as cold</p>
<p>As is a dead man’s nose. But I do see’t and feel’t</p>
<p>As you feel doing thus 425 , and see withal 426</p>
<p>The instruments that feel 427 .</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS If it be so,</p>
<p>We need no grave to bury honesty 428 :</p>
<p>There’s not a grain of it the face to sweeten 429</p>
<p>Of the whole dungy earth.</p>
<p>LEONTES What? Lack I credit 430 ?</p>
<p>FIRST LORD I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,</p>
<p>Upon this ground 431 . And more it would content me</p>
<p>To have her honour true than your suspicion 432 ,</p>
<p>Be blamed for’t how you might.</p>
<p>LEONTES Why, what need we</p>
<p>Commune with you of this, but rather follow</p>
<p>Our forceful instigation 433 ? Our prerogative</p>
<p>Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness</p>
<p>Imparts this 434 , which if you, or stupefied 435</p>
<p>Or seeming so in skill 436 , cannot or will not</p>
<p>Relish 437 a truth like us, inform yourselves</p>
<p>We need no more of your advice. The matter,</p>
<p>The loss, the gain, the ord’ring on’t 438 , is all</p>
<p>Properly 439 ours.</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS And I wish, my liege 440 ,</p>
<p>You had only in your silent judgement tried it,</p>
<p>Without more overture 441 .</p>
<p>LEONTES How could that be?</p>
<p>Either thou art most ignorant 442 by age,</p>
<p>Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo’s flight,</p>
<p>Added to their familiarity —</p>
<p>Which was as gross as ever touched conjecture,</p>
<p>That lacked sight only 443 , nought for approbation 444</p>
<p>But only seeing, all other circumstances</p>
<p>Made 445 up to th’deed 446 — doth push on this proceeding 447 .</p>
<p>Yet, for a greater confirmation —</p>
<p>For in an act of this importance ’twere</p>
<p>Most piteous to be wild 448 — I have dispatched in post 449</p>
<p>To sacred Delphos 450 , to Apollo’s temple,</p>
<p>Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know</p>
<p>Of stuffed sufficiency 451 . Now from the oracle</p>
<p>They will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had 452 ,</p>
<p>Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?</p>
<p>A LORD Well done, my lord.</p>
<p>LEONTES Though I am satisfied and need no more</p>
<p>Than what I know, yet shall the oracle</p>
<p>Give rest to th’minds of others, such as he 453</p>
<p>Whose ignorant credulity will not</p>
<p>Come up to 454 th’truth. So have we thought it good</p>
<p>From 455 our free 456 person she should be confined,</p>
<p>Lest that the treachery 457 of the two fled hence</p>
<p>Be left her to perform. Come, follow us.</p>
<p>We are to speak in public, for this business</p>
<p>Will raise 458 us all.</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS To laughter, as I take it,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>If the good truth were known.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
