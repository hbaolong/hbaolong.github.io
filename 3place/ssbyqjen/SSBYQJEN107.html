continues</h4>
<p>Enter Antipholus of Ephesus with a Jailer [or Officer ]</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Fear me not, man, I will not break away:</p>
<p>I’ll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money</p>
<p>To warrant thee as I am ’rested for 753 .</p>
<p>My wife is in a wayward 754 mood today,</p>
<p>And will not lightly 755 trust the messenger</p>
<p>That I should be attached 756 in Ephesus,</p>
<p>I tell you ’twill sound harshly in her ears.</p>
<p>Enter Dromio of Ephesus with a rope’s-end</p>
<p>Here comes my man, I think he brings the money.—</p>
<p>How now, sir? Have you that I sent you for?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Here’s that, I warrant you, will pay 757 them
all.</p>
<p>Gives the rope</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS But where’s the money?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS I’ll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate 758
.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS To what end 759 did I bid thee hie thee
home?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS To 760 a rope’s-end, sir, and to that end am I
returned.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS And to that end, sir, I will welcome you 761
.</p>
<p>Beats him</p>
<p>OFFICER Good sir, be patient.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Nay, ’tis for me to be patient, I am in
adversity.</p>
<p>OFFICER Good now, hold thy tongue.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands 762
.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Thou whoreson 763 , senseless villain.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not
feel your blows.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Thou art sensible in 764 nothing but blows, and
so is an ass 765 .</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS I am an ass, indeed, you may prove it by my long
ears 766 . I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this
instant, and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows. When I
am cold, he heats me with beating: when I am warm, he cools me with
beating: I am waked with it when I sleep, raised with it when I sit,
driven out of doors with it when I go from home, welcomed home with it
when I return, nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a beggar wont 767 her
brat, and I think when he hath lamed me, I shall beg with it from door
to door.</p>
<p>Enter Adriana, Luciana, Courtesan, and a schoolmaster called
Pinch</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Come, go along, my wife is coming yonder.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Mistress, respice finem 768 , respect your end, or
rather, the prophecy like the parrot 769 , ‘beware the rope’s-end’.</p>
<p>To Adriana</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Wilt thou still 770 talk?</p>
<p>Beats Dromio</p>
<p>COURTESAN How say you now? Is not your husband mad?</p>
<p>To Adriana</p>
<p>ADRIANA His incivility confirms no less.</p>
<p>Good Doctor 771 Pinch, you are a conjurer 772 ,</p>
<p>Establish him in his true sense 773 again,</p>
<p>And I will please 774 you what you will demand.</p>
<p>LUCIANA Alas, how fiery and how sharp 775 he looks.</p>
<p>COURTESAN Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy 776 .</p>
<p>PINCH Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.</p>
<p>To Antipholus</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.</p>
<p>Strikes him</p>
<p>PINCH I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,</p>
<p>To yield possession to my holy prayers</p>
<p>And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:</p>
<p>I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Peace, doting 777 wizard, peace, I am not
mad.</p>
<p>ADRIANA O, that thou wert not, poor distressèd soul.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS You minion, you, are these your customers 778
?</p>
<p>Did this companion 779 with the saffron 780 face</p>
<p>Revel and feast it at my house today,</p>
<p>Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut,</p>
<p>And I denied to enter in my house?</p>
<p>ADRIANA O husband, God doth know you dined at home,</p>
<p>Where would you had remained until this time,</p>
<p>Free from these slanders and this open shame.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Dined at home?— Thou villain, what sayest
thou?</p>
<p>To Dromio</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Sir, sooth 781 to say, you did not dine at
home.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Were not my doors locked up, and I shut
out?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Perdie 782 , your doors were locked, and you shut
out.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS And did not she herself revile me there?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Sans fable 783 , she herself reviled you there.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt and scorn
me?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Certes 784 she did, the kitchen-vestal 785 scorned
you.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS And did not I in rage depart from thence?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS In verity 786 you did, my bones bear witness,</p>
<p>That since have felt the vigour of his rage.</p>
<p>ADRIANA Is’t good to soothe 787 him in these contraries 788 ?</p>
<p>To Pinch</p>
<p>PINCH It is no shame. The fellow 789 finds 790 his vein,</p>
<p>Aside to Adriana</p>
<p>And yielding to 791 him, humours well his frenzy.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Thou hast suborned 792 the goldsmith to arrest
me.</p>
<p>ADRIANA Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,</p>
<p>By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Money by me? Heart and good will you might 793
,</p>
<p>But surely, master, not a rag 794 of money.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Went’st not thou to her for a purse of
ducats?</p>
<p>ADRIANA He came to me and I delivered it.</p>
<p>LUCIANA And I am witness with her that she did.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS God and the rope-maker bear me witness</p>
<p>That I was sent for nothing but a rope.</p>
<p>PINCH Mistress, both man and master is possessed,</p>
<p>I know it by their pale and deadly 795 looks.</p>
<p>They must be bound and laid in some dark room.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth 796
today?—</p>
<p>To Adriana</p>
<p>And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?</p>
<p>To Dromio</p>
<p>ADRIANA I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS And, gentle master, I received no gold:</p>
<p>But I confess, sir, that we were locked out.</p>
<p>ADRIANA Dissembling 797 villain, thou speak’st false in both.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,</p>
<p>And art confederate 798 with a damnèd pack 799</p>
<p>To make a loathsome abject scorn 800 of me.</p>
<p>But with these nails I’ll pluck out these false eyes</p>
<p>That would behold in me this shameful sport.</p>
<p>He threatens Adriana</p>
<p>Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives 801</p>
<p>ADRIANA O, bind him, bind him, let him not come near me.</p>
<p>PINCH More company 802 , the fiend is strong within him.</p>
<p>LUCIANA Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS What, will you murder me?— Thou jailer,
thou,</p>
<p>I am thy prisoner. Wilt thou suffer them</p>
<p>To make a rescue 803 ?</p>
<p>OFFICER Masters, let him go.</p>
<p>He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.</p>
<p>PINCH Go bind this man, for he is frantic 804 too.</p>
<p>They bind Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p>ADRIANA What wilt thou do, thou peevish 805 officer?</p>
<p>Hast thou delight to see a wretched man</p>
<p>Do outrage and displeasure 806 to himself ?</p>
<p>OFFICER He is my prisoner. If I let him go,</p>
<p>The debt he owes will be required of me.</p>
<p>ADRIANA I will discharge 807 thee ere I go from thee.</p>
<p>Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,</p>
<p>And knowing how the debt grows 808 , I will pay it.</p>
<p>Good master doctor, see him safe conveyed</p>
<p>Home to my house. O, most unhappy day!</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS O, most unhappy strumpet!</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Master, I am here entered in bond 809 for you.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Out on thee, villain, wherefore dost thou mad
810 me?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Will you be bound for nothing? Be mad, good master:
cry ‘The devil!’ 811</p>
<p>LUCIANA God help poor souls, how idly do they talk.</p>
<p>ADRIANA Go bear him hence.— Sister, go you with me.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Pinch and his assistants, bearing Antipholus and Dromio of
Ephesus ]</p>
<p>Adriana, Luciana, Officer and Courtesan remain</p>
<p>Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?</p>
<p>OFFICER One Angelo, a goldsmith. Do you know him?</p>
<p>ADRIANA I know the man. What is the sum he owes?</p>
<p>OFFICER Two hundred ducats.</p>
<p>ADRIANA Say, how grows it due?</p>
<p>OFFICER Due for a chain your husband had of him.</p>
<p>ADRIANA He did bespeak 812 a chain for me, but had it not.</p>
<p>COURTESAN Whenas your husband all in rage today</p>
<p>Came to my house and took away my ring,</p>
<p>The ring I saw upon his finger now,</p>
<p>Straight after did I meet him with a chain.</p>
<p>ADRIANA It may be so, but I did never see it.—</p>
<p>Come, jailer, bring me where the goldsmith is.</p>
<p>I long to know the truth hereof 813 at large 814 .</p>
<p>Enter Antipholus and Dromio [of ] Syracuse with their rapiers
drawn</p>
<p>LUCIANA God for thy mercy, they are loose again.</p>
<p>ADRIANA And come with naked 815 swords.</p>
<p>Let’s call more help to have them bound again.</p>
<p>OFFICER Away, they’ll kill us.</p>
<p>Run all out. Exeunt all, as fast as may be, frighted.</p>
<p>[Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse remain ]</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I see these witches are afraid of swords.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE She that would be 816 your wife now ran from
you.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Come to the Centaur, fetch our stuff 817 from
thence.</p>
<p>I long that we were safe and sound aboard.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Faith, stay here this night, they will surely do
us no harm. You saw they speak us fair 818 , give us gold. Methinks they
are such a gentle nation that, but for the mountain of mad flesh that
claims 819 marriage of me, I could find in my heart to stay here still
820 and turn witch.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I will not stay tonight for all the town.</p>
<p>Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
