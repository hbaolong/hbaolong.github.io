21</h4>
<p>Enter Helicanus, to him two Sailors</p>
<p>One of Tyre and one of Mytilene</p>
<p>SAILOR OF TYRE Where is</p>
<p>To Sailor of Mytilene</p>
<p>Lord Helicanus? He can resolve 1242 you—</p>
<p>O, here he is.—</p>
<p>Sir, there is a barge put off from Mytilene,</p>
<p>To Helicanus</p>
<p>And in it is Lysimachus, the governor,</p>
<p>Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?</p>
<p>HELICANUS That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.</p>
<p>SAILOR OF TYRE Ho, gentlemen, my lord calls!</p>
<p>Enter two or three Gentlemen</p>
<p>Of Tyre</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Doth your lordship call?</p>
<p>HELICANUS Gentlemen, there is some of worth 1243 would come
aboard.</p>
<p>I pray, greet him fairly 1244 .</p>
<p>Enter Lysimachus</p>
<p>And a Lord</p>
<p>SAILOR OF MYTILENE Sir, This is the man that can in aught you would
1245 Resolve you.</p>
<p>To Lysimachus</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Hail, reverent 1246 sir, the gods preserve you.</p>
<p>HELICANUS And you, to outlive the age I am</p>
<p>And die as I would do 1247 .</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS You wish me well.</p>
<p>Being on shore, honouring of Neptune’s triumphs 1248 ,</p>
<p>Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,</p>
<p>I made to it, to know of whence you are.</p>
<p>HELICANUS First, what is your place 1249 ?</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS I am the governor of this 1250 place you lie before.</p>
<p>HELICANUS Sir, our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king,</p>
<p>A man, who for this three months hath not spoken</p>
<p>To anyone, nor taken sustenance</p>
<p>But to prorogue 1251 his grief.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Upon what ground is his distemperature? 1252</p>
<p>HELICANUS ’Twould be too tedious 1253 to repeat,</p>
<p>But the main grief springs from the loss of a</p>
<p>Belovèd daughter and a wife.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS May we not see him?</p>
<p>HELICANUS You may, but bootless 1254 is your sight: he will</p>
<p>Not speak to any.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Yet let me obtain my wish.</p>
<p>HELICANUS Behold him.</p>
<p>Reveals Pericles</p>
<p>This was a goodly person.</p>
<p>Till the disaster that one mortal 1255 night</p>
<p>Drove him to this.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Sir king, all hail, the gods preserve you!</p>
<p>To Pericles</p>
<p>Hail, royal sir!</p>
<p>HELICANUS It is in vain, he will not speak to you.</p>
<p>LORD Sir, we have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager</p>
<p>Would win some words of him.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS ’Tis well bethought.</p>
<p>She questionless with her sweet harmony</p>
<p>And other chosen 1256 attractions, would allure 1257</p>
<p>And make a battery through his deafened parts,</p>
<p>Which now are midway stopped 1258 ,</p>
<p>She is all happy 1259 as the fairest of all,</p>
<p>And with her fellow maid is now upon</p>
<p>The leafy shelter that abuts against</p>
<p>The island’s side.</p>
<p>[Exit Lord ]</p>
<p>HELICANUS Sure all effectless 1260 , yet nothing we’ll omit</p>
<p>That bears recovery’s name 1261 . But since your kindness</p>
<p>We have stretched thus far, let us beseech you</p>
<p>That for our gold we may provision have,</p>
<p>Wherein we are not destitute for want</p>
<p>But weary for the staleness.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS O, sir, a courtesy</p>
<p>Which if we should deny, the most just gods</p>
<p>For every graft 1262 would send a caterpillar</p>
<p>And so inflict 1263 our province. Yet once more</p>
<p>Let me entreat to know at large 1264 the cause</p>
<p>Of your king’s sorrow.</p>
<p>HELICANUS Sit, sir, I will recount it to you—</p>
<p>[Enter Lord with Marina and her companion ]</p>
<p>But see, I am prevented.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS O, here’s the lady that I sent for!—</p>
<p>Welcome, fair one— is’t not a goodly present 1265 ?</p>
<p>HELICANUS She’s a gallant 1266 lady.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS She’s such a one that, were I well assured</p>
<p>Came of a gentle kind 1267 and noble stock 1268 ,</p>
<p>I’d wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed 1269 .</p>
<p>Fair one, all goodness that consists 1270 in beauty</p>
<p>Expect even here, where is a kingly patient.</p>
<p>If that thy prosperous 1271 and artificial feat 1272</p>
<p>Can draw him but to answer thee in aught 1273 ,</p>
<p>Thy sacred physic 1274 shall receive such pay</p>
<p>As thy desires can wish.</p>
<p>MARINA Sir, I will use my utmost skill in his</p>
<p>Recovery, provided that none but</p>
<p>I and my companion maid be suffered 1275</p>
<p>To come near him.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Come, let us leave her, and the gods make her
prosperous.</p>
<p>The Song 1276</p>
<p>All men except Pericles stand aside while Marina sings</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Marked he 1277 your music?</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>MARINA No, nor looked on us.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS See, she will speak to him.</p>
<p>Steps back</p>
<p>MARINA Hail, sir! My lord, lend ear.</p>
<p>PERICLES Hum, ha.</p>
<p>Pushes Marina away</p>
<p>MARINA I am a maid,</p>
<p>My lord, that ne’er before invited eyes,</p>
<p>But have been gazed on like a comet. She speaks,</p>
<p>My lord, that maybe hath endured a grief</p>
<p>Might equal yours, if both were justly weighed 1278 .</p>
<p>Though wayward 1279 Fortune did malign my state 1280 ,</p>
<p>My derivation was from ancestors</p>
<p>Who stood equivalent with mighty kings,</p>
<p>But time hath rooted out 1281 my parentage,</p>
<p>And to the world and awkward casualties 1282</p>
<p>Bound me in servitude.— I will desist,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>But there is something glows 1283 upon my cheek</p>
<p>And whispers in mine ear 1284 , ‘Go not till he speak.’</p>
<p>PERICLES My fortunes — parentage — good parentage —</p>
<p>To equal mine? Was it not thus? What say you?</p>
<p>MARINA I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage</p>
<p>You would not do me violence.</p>
<p>PERICLES I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.</p>
<p>You’re like something that — What country-woman 1285 ?</p>
<p>Here of these shores?</p>
<p>MARINA No, nor of any shores,</p>
<p>Yet I was mortally brought forth and am</p>
<p>No other than I appear.</p>
<p>PERICLES I am great 1286 with woe, and shall deliver 1287
weeping.</p>
<p>My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one</p>
<p>My daughter might have been. My queen’s square brows 1288 ,</p>
<p>Her stature to an inch, as wand-like straight 1289 ,</p>
<p>As silver-voiced, her eyes as jewel-like,</p>
<p>And cased 1290 as richly, in pace 1291 another Juno 1292 ,</p>
<p>Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry</p>
<p>The more she gives them speech 1293 . Where do you live?</p>
<p>MARINA Where I am but a stranger: from the deck</p>
<p>You may discern the place.</p>
<p>PERICLES Where were you bred?</p>
<p>And how achieved you these endowments which</p>
<p>You make more rich to owe 1294 ?</p>
<p>MARINA If I should tell my history, it would seem</p>
<p>Like lies disdained in the reporting.</p>
<p>PERICLES Prithee speak,</p>
<p>Falseness cannot come from thee, for thou look’st</p>
<p>Modest as justice 1295 , and thou seem’st a palace</p>
<p>For the crowned truth to dwell in 1296 . I will believe thee</p>
<p>And make senses credit thy relation 1297</p>
<p>To 1298 points that seem impossible, for thou look’st</p>
<p>Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends 1299 ?</p>
<p>Did’st thou not say when I did push thee back —</p>
<p>Which was when I perceived thee — that thou cam’st</p>
<p>From good descending?</p>
<p>MARINA So indeed I did.</p>
<p>PERICLES Report thy parentage. I think thou saidst</p>
<p>Thou hadst been tossed from wrong to injury,</p>
<p>And that thou thought’st thy griefs might equal mine,</p>
<p>If both were opened 1300 .</p>
<p>MARINA Some such thing I said,</p>
<p>And said no more but what my thoughts</p>
<p>Did warrant 1301 me was likely 1302 .</p>
<p>PERICLES Tell thy story.</p>
<p>If thine considered prove the thousand part</p>
<p>Of my endurance 1303 , thou art a man, and I</p>
<p>Have suffered like a girl. Yet thou dost look</p>
<p>Like Patience 1304 , gazing on kings’ graves and smiling</p>
<p>Extremity 1305 out of act 1306 . What were thy friends?</p>
<p>How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?</p>
<p>Recount, I do beseech thee. Come, sit by me.</p>
<p>MARINA My name is Marina.</p>
<p>Sits</p>
<p>PERICLES O, I am mocked,</p>
<p>And thou by some incensèd god sent hither</p>
<p>To make the world to laugh at me!</p>
<p>MARINA Patience,</p>
<p>Good sir, or here I’ll cease.</p>
<p>PERICLES Nay, I’ll be patient.</p>
<p>Thou little know’st how thou dost startle me</p>
<p>To call thyself Marina.</p>
<p>MARINA The name</p>
<p>Was given me by one that had some power:</p>
<p>My father, and a king.</p>
<p>PERICLES How! A king’s daughter?</p>
<p>And called Marina?</p>
<p>MARINA You said you would believe me,</p>
<p>But not to be a troubler of your peace,</p>
<p>I will end here.</p>
<p>PERICLES But are you flesh and blood?</p>
<p>Have you a working pulse, and are no fairy?</p>
<p>Motion? 1307 Well, speak on. Where were you born?</p>
<p>And wherefore called Marina?</p>
<p>MARINA Called Marina,</p>
<p>For I was born at sea.</p>
<p>PERICLES At sea? What mother?</p>
<p>MARINA My mother was the daughter of a king,</p>
<p>Who died the minute I was born,</p>
<p>As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft</p>
<p>Delivered weeping 1308 .</p>
<p>PERICLES O, stop there a little!</p>
<p>This is the rarest dream that e’er dulled 1309 sleep</p>
<p>Did mock sad fools withal 1310 . This cannot be</p>
<p>My daughter, buried 1311 . Well, where were you bred?</p>
<p>I’ll hear you more, to th’bottom of your story,</p>
<p>And never interrupt you.</p>
<p>MARINA You scorn. Believe me, ’twere best I did give o’er.</p>
<p>PERICLES I will believe you by the syllable 1312</p>
<p>Of what you shall deliver. Yet give me leave —</p>
<p>How came you in these parts? Where were you bred?</p>
<p>MARINA The king my father did in Tarsus leave me,</p>
<p>Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,</p>
<p>Did seek to murder me, and wooed a villain</p>
<p>To attempt it, who having drawn 1313 to do’t,</p>
<p>A crew of pirates came and rescued me,</p>
<p>Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,</p>
<p>Whither will you have me? 1314 Why do you weep? It may be</p>
<p>You think me an imposture 1315 . No, good faith 1316 .</p>
<p>I am the daughter to King Pericles,</p>
<p>If good King Pericles be 1317 .</p>
<p>PERICLES Ho, Helicanus!</p>
<p>Calls</p>
<p>HELICANUS Calls my lord?</p>
<p>Helicanus, Lysimachus and Attendants come forward</p>
<p>PERICLES Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,</p>
<p>Most wise in general 1318 . Tell me if thou canst,</p>
<p>What this maid is, or what is like 1319 to be,</p>
<p>That thus hath made me weep.</p>
<p>HELICANUS I know not,</p>
<p>But here’s the regent, sir, of Mytilene,</p>
<p>Speaks 1320 nobly of her.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS She never would tell</p>
<p>Her parentage, being demanded that,</p>
<p>She would sit still 1321 and weep.</p>
<p>PERICLES O, Helicanus, strike me!—</p>
<p>Honoured sir,</p>
<p>To Lysimachus</p>
<p>Give me a gash 1322 ! Put me to present 1323 pain,</p>
<p>Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me</p>
<p>O’erbear 1324 the shores of my mortality,</p>
<p>And drown me with their sweetness.—</p>
<p>O, come hither,</p>
<p>To Marina</p>
<p>Thou that beget’st 1325 him that did thee beget,</p>
<p>Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,</p>
<p>And found at sea again! O Helicanus,</p>
<p>Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud</p>
<p>As thunder threatens us 1326 : this is Marina!</p>
<p>What was thy mother’s name? Tell me but that,</p>
<p>For truth can never be confirmed enough</p>
<p>Though doubts did ever sleep 1327 .</p>
<p>MARINA First, sir, I pray, what is your title?</p>
<p>PERICLES I am Pericles of Tyre. But tell me now</p>
<p>My drowned queen’s name, as in the rest you said</p>
<p>Thou hast been god-like perfect, the heir of kingdoms,</p>
<p>And another life to Pericles thy father.</p>
<p>MARINA Is it no more to be your daughter than</p>
<p>To say my mother’s name was Thaisa?</p>
<p>Thaisa was my mother, who did end</p>
<p>The minute I began.</p>
<p>PERICLES Now blessing on thee! Rise, th’art my child.—</p>
<p>She rises</p>
<p>Give me fresh garments.—</p>
<p>To Attendants</p>
<p>Mine own, Helicanus!</p>
<p>She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,</p>
<p>By savage Cleon. She shall tell thee all,</p>
<p>When 1328 thou shalt kneel and justify in knowledge 1329</p>
<p>She is thy very princess. Who is this?</p>
<p>HELICANUS Sir, ’tis the governor of Mytilene,</p>
<p>Who hearing of your melancholy state</p>
<p>Did come to see you.</p>
<p>PERICLES I embrace you.—</p>
<p>To Lysimachus</p>
<p>Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding 1330 .</p>
<p>To Attendants</p>
<p>O heavens, bless my girl! But hark, what music?</p>
<p>Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him</p>
<p>O’er point by point, for yet he seems to doubt 1331</p>
<p>How sure 1332 you are my daughter. But what music?</p>
<p>HELICANUS My lord, I hear none.</p>
<p>PERICLES None?</p>
<p>The music of the spheres 1333 ! List 1334 , my Marina.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS It is not good to cross 1335 him, give him way.</p>
<p>PERICLES Rarest 1336 sounds, do ye not hear?</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Music, my lord? I hear.</p>
<p>PERICLES Most heavenly music.</p>
<p>It nips 1337 me unto list’ning, and thick slumber</p>
<p>Hangs upon mine eyes. Let me rest.</p>
<p>Sleeps</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS A pillow for his head.</p>
<p>To Attendants</p>
<p>So, leave him all.</p>
<p>Well, my companion friends,</p>
<p>If this but answer to my just belief 1338 ,</p>
<p>I’ll well remember 1339 you.</p>
<p>All except Pericles stand back</p>
<p>[Enter ] Diana</p>
<p>DIANA My temple stands in Ephesus. Hie thee thither 1340</p>
<p>And do upon mine altar sacrifice.</p>
<p>There when my maiden 1341 priests are met together,</p>
<p>Before the people all</p>
<p>Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife,</p>
<p>To mourn thy crosses 1342 with thy daughter’s. Call 1343 ,</p>
<p>And give them repetition to the life 1344 .</p>
<p>Perform my bidding, or thou liv’st in woe:</p>
<p>Do it, and happy, by my silver bow 1345 .</p>
<p>Awake and tell thy dream.</p>
<p>[Exit Diana ]</p>
<p>PERICLES Celestial Dian, goddess argentine 1346 .</p>
<p>I will obey thee.— Helicanus!</p>
<p>Helicanus, Lysimachus and Marina come forward</p>
<p>HELICANUS Sir.</p>
<p>PERICLES My purpose was for 1347 Tarsus, there to strike</p>
<p>The inhospitable Cleon, but I am</p>
<p>For other service first. Toward Ephesus</p>
<p>Turn our blown 1348 sails, eftsoons 1349 I’ll tell thee why.</p>
<p>Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore</p>
<p>To Lysimachus</p>
<p>And give you gold for such provision</p>
<p>As our intents will need?</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Sir, with all my heart,</p>
<p>And when you come ashore I have another suit.</p>
<p>PERICLES You shall prevail, were it to woo my daughter,</p>
<p>For it seems you have been noble towards her.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Sir, lend me your arm.</p>
<p>PERICLES Come, my Marina.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Second Chorus / running scene 22</p>
<p>Enter Gower</p>
<p>GOWER Now our sands are almost run,</p>
<p>More a little 1350 , and then dumb.</p>
<p>This my last boon 1351 give me,</p>
<p>For such kindness must relieve me:</p>
<p>That you aptly 1352 will suppose</p>
<p>What pageantry, what feats, what shows,</p>
<p>What minstrelsy 1353 , and pretty din 1354 ,</p>
<p>The regent made in Mytilene</p>
<p>To greet the king. So he thrived</p>
<p>That he is promised to be wived</p>
<p>To fair Marina, but in no wise 1355</p>
<p>Till he 1356 had done his sacrifice</p>
<p>As Dian bade, whereto being bound 1357 ,</p>
<p>The interim, pray you, all confound 1358 .</p>
<p>In feathered briefness 1359 sails are filled,</p>
<p>And wishes fall out as they’re willed.</p>
<p>At Ephesus the temple see</p>
<p>Our king and all his company.</p>
<p>That he can hither come so soon,</p>
<p>Is by your fancies’ thankful doom 1360 .</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
