<h4 id="scene-2-581-running-scene-5">Scene 2 581 / running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter Kent and Steward [Oswald ], severally 582</p>
<p>Kent disguised as Caius</p>
<p>OSWALD Good dawning 583 to thee, friend: art of this house?</p>
<p>KENT Ay 584 .</p>
<p>OSWALD Where may we set 585 our horses?</p>
<p>KENT I’th’mire 586 .</p>
<p>OSWALD Prithee, if thou lov’st me 587 , tell me.</p>
<p>KENT I love thee not.</p>
<p>OSWALD Why then, I care not for thee.</p>
<p>KENT If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold 588 , I would make thee care
for me.</p>
<p>OSWALD Why dost thou use 589 me thus? I know thee not.</p>
<p>KENT Fellow, I know thee.</p>
<p>OSWALD What dost thou know me for 590 ?</p>
<p>KENT A knave 591 , a rascal, an eater of broken meats 592 , a base,
proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited 593 , hundred-pound 594 , filthy,
worsted-stocking 595 knave, a lily-livered 596 , action-taking 597 ,
whoreson 598 , glass 599 -gazing 600 , super-serviceable 601 finical 602
rogue: one-trunk-inheriting 603 slave: one that wouldst be a bawd 604 in
way of good service 605 , and art nothing but the composition 606 of a
knave, beggar, coward, pander 607 , and the son and heir of a mongrel
bitch: one whom I will beat into clamorous whining if thou deny’st the
least syllable of thy addition 608 .</p>
<p>OSWALD Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou thus to rail 609 on one
that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!</p>
<p>KENT What a brazen-faced varlet 610 art thou to deny thou knowest me!
Is it two days since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the
king? Draw 611 , you rogue, for though it be night, yet the moon shines:
I’ll make a sop o’th’moonshine 612 of you, you whoreson cullionly 613
barber-monger 614 . Draw.</p>
<p>Draws his sword</p>
<p>OSWALD Away! I have nothing to do with thee.</p>
<p>KENT Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the king, and
take vanity the puppet’s 615 part against the royalty of her father:
draw, you rogue, or I’ll so carbonado 616 your shanks: draw, you rascal,
come your ways 617 .</p>
<p>OSWALD Help, ho! Murder! Help!</p>
<p>KENT Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue, stand, you neat 618 slave,
strike!</p>
<p>Beats him</p>
<p>OSWALD Help, ho! Murder! Murder!</p>
<p>Enter Bastard [Edmund ], Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants</p>
<p>EDMUND How now, what’s the matter? Part!</p>
<p>KENT With you 619 , Goodman 620 boy 621 , if you please: come, I’ll
flesh ye 622 : come on, young master.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Weapons? Arms? What’s the matter here?</p>
<p>CORNWALL Keep peace, upon your lives: he dies that strikes again.
What is the matter?</p>
<p>REGAN The messengers from our sister and the king.</p>
<p>CORNWALL What is your difference 623 ? Speak.</p>
<p>OSWALD I am scarce in breath, my lord.</p>
<p>KENT No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour 624 . You cowardly
rascal, nature disclaims in 625 thee: a tailor made thee 626 .</p>
<p>CORNWALL Thou art a strange fellow — a tailor make a man?</p>
<p>KENT A tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or a painter could not have made
him so ill 627 , though they had been but two years o’th’trade.</p>
<p>CORNWALL Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?</p>
<p>OSWALD This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared at suit of
his grey beard 628 —</p>
<p>KENT Thou whoreson zed, thou unnecessary letter 629 !— My lord, if
you will give me leave, I will tread this unbolted 630 villain into
mortar and daub the wall of a jakes 631 with him.— Spare my grey beard,
you wagtail 632 ?</p>
<p>CORNWALL Peace, sirrah!</p>
<p>You beastly 633 knave, know you no reverence?</p>
<p>KENT Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege 634 .</p>
<p>CORNWALL Why art thou angry?</p>
<p>KENT That such a slave as this should wear a sword,</p>
<p>Who wears no honesty 635 . Such smiling rogues as these,</p>
<p>Like rats, oft bite the holy cords 636 a-twain 637</p>
<p>Which are too intrinse t’unloose 638 , smooth 639 every passion</p>
<p>That in the natures of their lords rebel 640 ,</p>
<p>Being oil to fire 641 , snow to the colder moods,</p>
<p>Revenge, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks 642</p>
<p>With every gall 643 and vary 644 of their masters,</p>
<p>Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.—</p>
<p>A plague upon your epileptic visage 645 !</p>
<p>To Oswald</p>
<p>Smile you my 646 speeches, as 647 I were a fool?</p>
<p>Goose 648 , if I had you upon Sarum 649 plain,</p>
<p>I’d drive ye cackling home to Camelot 650 .</p>
<p>CORNWALL What, art thou mad, old fellow?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER How fell you out? Say that.</p>
<p>KENT No contraries hold more antipathy</p>
<p>Than I and such a knave.</p>
<p>CORNWALL Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?</p>
<p>KENT His countenance likes 651 me not.</p>
<p>CORNWALL No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers—</p>
<p>KENT Sir, ’tis my occupation 652 to be plain:</p>
<p>I have seen better faces in my time</p>
<p>Than stands on any shoulder that I see</p>
<p>Before me at this instant.</p>
<p>CORNWALL This is some fellow</p>
<p>Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect</p>
<p>A saucy 653 roughness, and constrains the garb</p>
<p>Quite from his nature 654 . He cannot flatter, he:</p>
<p>An 655 honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!</p>
<p>An they will take it, so 656 : if not, he’s plain 657 .</p>
<p>These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness</p>
<p>Harbour more craft 658 and more corrupter 659 ends</p>
<p>Than twenty silly ducking observants 660</p>
<p>That stretch their duties nicely 661 .</p>
<p>KENT Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity 662 ,</p>
<p>Under th’allowance 663 of your great aspect 664 ,</p>
<p>Whose influence 665 , like the wreath of radiant fire</p>
<p>On flickering Phoebus 666 ’ front 667 —</p>
<p>CORNWALL What mean’st by this?</p>
<p>KENT To go out of my dialect 668 , which you discommend so much. I
know, sir, I am no flatterer: he that beguiled 669 you in a plain accent
was a plain knave, which for my part I will not be, though I should win
your displeasure to entreat me to’t 670 .</p>
<p>CORNWALL What was th’offence you gave him?</p>
<p>To Oswald</p>
<p>OSWALD I never gave him any.</p>
<p>It pleased the king his master very late</p>
<p>To strike at me, upon his misconstruction 671 :</p>
<p>When he, compact 672 and flattering his displeasure,</p>
<p>Tripped me behind, being 673 down, insulted, railed,</p>
<p>And put upon him such a deal of man 674</p>
<p>That worthied him 675 , got praises of the king</p>
<p>For him attempting who was self-subdued 676 :</p>
<p>And, in the fleshment 677 of this dread exploit 678 ,</p>
<p>Drew on me here again.</p>
<p>KENT None of these rogues and cowards</p>
<p>But Ajax is their fool 679 .</p>
<p>CORNWALL Fetch forth the stocks 680 !—</p>
<p>You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent 681 braggart 682 ,</p>
<p>We’ll teach you.</p>
<p>KENT Sir, I am too old to learn.</p>
<p>Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king,</p>
<p>On whose employment I was sent to you:</p>
<p>You shall do small respects, show too bold malice 683</p>
<p>Against the grace 684 and person of my master,</p>
<p>Stocking his messenger.</p>
<p>CORNWALL Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,</p>
<p>There shall he sit till noon.</p>
<p>REGAN Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too.</p>
<p>KENT Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog</p>
<p>You should not use 685 me so.</p>
<p>REGAN Sir, being his knave, I will.</p>
<p>Stocks brought out</p>
<p>CORNWALL This is a fellow of the self-same colour 686</p>
<p>Our sister 687 speaks of. Come, bring away 688 the stocks!</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Let me beseech your grace not to do so:</p>
<p>The king his master needs must take it ill</p>
<p>That he so slightly valued in his messenger,</p>
<p>Should have him thus restrained.</p>
<p>CORNWALL I’ll answer 689 that.</p>
<p>REGAN My sister may receive it much more worse</p>
<p>To have her gentleman abused, assaulted.</p>
<p>Kent put in the stocks</p>
<p>CORNWALL Come, my lord, away.</p>
<p>Exeunt. [Gloucester and Kent remain ]</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER I am sorry for thee, friend: ’tis the duke’s pleasure 690
,</p>
<p>Whose disposition all the world well knows</p>
<p>Will not be rubbed 691 nor stopped. I’ll entreat for thee.</p>
<p>KENT Pray do not, sir. I have watched 692 and travelled hard:</p>
<p>Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I’ll whistle.</p>
<p>A good man’s fortune may grow out at heels 693 .</p>
<p>Give you good morrow 694 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER The duke’s to blame in this: ’twill be ill taken.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KENT Good king, that must approve 695 the common saw 696 ,</p>
<p>Thou out of heaven’s benediction com’st</p>
<p>To the warm sun 697 .</p>
<p>Pulls out a letter</p>
<p>Approach, thou beacon 698 to this under globe 699 ,</p>
<p>That by thy comfortable 700 beams I may</p>
<p>Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles</p>
<p>But misery 701 . I know ’tis from Cordelia,</p>
<p>Who hath most fortunately been informed</p>
<p>Of my obscurèd course 702 , and shall find time</p>
<p>From 703 this enormous state 704 , seeking to give</p>
<p>Losses their remedies. All weary and o’erwatched 705 ,</p>
<p>Take vantage 706 , heavy eyes, not to behold</p>
<p>This shameful lodging.</p>
<p>Fortune, goodnight: smile once more, turn thy wheel 707 !</p>
<p>Sleeps</p>
<p>Enter Edgar</p>
<p>EDGAR I heard myself proclaimed 708 ,</p>
<p>And by the happy 709 hollow of a tree</p>
<p>Escaped the hunt. No port is free, no place</p>
<p>That guard and most unusual vigilance</p>
<p>Does not attend my taking 710 . Whiles I may scape,</p>
<p>I will preserve myself, and am bethought 711</p>
<p>To take the basest and most poorest shape</p>
<p>That ever penury in contempt of man 712</p>
<p>Brought near to beast: my face I’ll grime with filth,</p>
<p>Blanket my loins, elf 713 all my hairs in knots,</p>
<p>And with presented 714 nakedness outface</p>
<p>The winds and persecutions of the sky.</p>
<p>The country gives me proof and precedent</p>
<p>Of Bedlam 715 beggars, who with roaring voices</p>
<p>Strike in their numbed and mortifièd 716 arms</p>
<p>Pins, wooden pricks 717 , nails, sprigs of rosemary,</p>
<p>And with this horrible object 718 , from low 719 farms,</p>
<p>Poor pelting 720 villages, sheepcotes, and mills,</p>
<p>Sometimes with lunatic bans 721 , sometime with prayers,</p>
<p>Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod 722 , poor Tom 723 !</p>
<p>That’s something yet 724 : Edgar I nothing am 725 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Lear, Fool and Gentleman 726</p>
<p>LEAR ’Tis strange that they 727 should so depart from home</p>
<p>And not send back my messengers.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN As I learned,</p>
<p>The night before there was no purpose in them</p>
<p>Of this remove.</p>
<p>KENT Hail to thee, noble master!</p>
<p>Wakes</p>
<p>LEAR Ha? Mak’st thou this shame thy pastime?</p>
<p>KENT No, my lord.</p>
<p>FOOL Ha, ha, he wears cruel 728 garters. Horses are tied by the
heads, dogs and bears by th’neck, monkeys by th’loins, and men by
th’legs: when a man’s over-lusty at legs 729 , then he wears wooden
nether-stocks 730 .</p>
<p>LEAR What’s he that hath so much thy place 731 mistook</p>
<p>To 732 set thee here?</p>
<p>KENT It is both he and she:</p>
<p>Your son 733 and daughter.</p>
<p>LEAR No.</p>
<p>KENT Yes.</p>
<p>LEAR No, I say.</p>
<p>KENT I say, yea.</p>
<p>LEAR By Jupiter, I swear, no.</p>
<p>KENT By Juno 734 , I swear, ay.</p>
<p>LEAR They durst not do’t:</p>
<p>They could not, would not do’t: ’tis worse than murder</p>
<p>To do upon respect 735 such violent outrage.</p>
<p>Resolve 736 me with all modest 737 haste which way 738</p>
<p>Thou might’st deserve or they impose this usage 739 ,</p>
<p>Coming from us 740 .</p>
<p>KENT My lord, when at their home</p>
<p>I did commend 741 your highness’ letters to them,</p>
<p>Ere I was risen from the place that showed</p>
<p>My duty kneeling, came there a reeking 742 post 743 ,</p>
<p>Stewed 744 in his haste, half breathless, panting forth</p>
<p>From Goneril his mistress salutations,</p>
<p>Delivered letters, spite of intermission 745 ,</p>
<p>Which presently 746 they read: on those contents</p>
<p>They summoned up their meiny 747 , straight 748 took horse,</p>
<p>Commanded me to follow and attend</p>
<p>The leisure of their answer 749 , gave me cold looks:</p>
<p>And meeting here the other messenger,</p>
<p>Whose welcome I perceived had poisoned mine —</p>
<p>Being the very fellow which of late</p>
<p>Displayed so saucily against 750 your highness —</p>
<p>Having more man than wit 751 about me, drew 752 .</p>
<p>He raised the house with loud and coward cries:</p>
<p>Your son and daughter found this trespass worth</p>
<p>The shame which here it suffers.</p>
<p>FOOL Winter’s not gone yet if the wild geese fly that way 753 .</p>
<p>Fathers that wear rags</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Do make their children blind 754 ,</p>
<p>But fathers that bear bags 755</p>
<p>Shall see their children kind.</p>
<p>Fortune, that arrant 756 whore,</p>
<p>Ne’er turns the key 757 to th’poor.</p>
<p>But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours 758 for thy
daughters as thou canst tell 759 in a year.</p>
<p>LEAR O, how this mother 760 swells up toward my heart!</p>
<p>Hysterica passio 761 , down, thou climbing sorrow:</p>
<p>Thy element’s 762 below 763 !— Where is this daughter?</p>
<p>KENT With the earl, sir, here within.</p>
<p>LEAR Follow me not: stay here.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Made you no more offence but what you speak of?</p>
<p>KENT None. How chance the king comes with so small a number?</p>
<p>FOOL An thou had’st been set i’th’stocks for that question, thou’dst
well deserved it.</p>
<p>KENT Why, fool?</p>
<p>FOOL We’ll set thee to school to 764 an ant to teach thee there’s no
labouring i’th’winter 765 . All that follow their noses are led by their
eyes but blind men, and there’s not a nose among twenty but can smell
him that’s stinking 766 . Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a
hill lest it break thy neck with following: but the great one that goes
upward, let him draw thee after. When a wise man gives thee better
counsel, give me mine again 767 : I would have none but knaves follow
it, since a fool gives it.</p>
<p>That sir 768 which serves and seeks for gain,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>And follows but for form 769 ,</p>
<p>Will pack 770 when it begins to rain,</p>
<p>And leave thee in the storm.</p>
<p>But I will tarry, the fool will stay,</p>
<p>And let the wise man fly:</p>
<p>The knave turns fool that runs away,</p>
<p>The fool no knave, perdy 771 .</p>
<p>Enter Lear and Gloucester</p>
<p>KENT Where learned you this, fool?</p>
<p>FOOL Not i’th’stocks, fool.</p>
<p>LEAR Deny 772 to speak with me? They are sick, they are weary,</p>
<p>They have travelled all the night? Mere fetches 773 ,</p>
<p>The images of revolt and flying off 774 .</p>
<p>Fetch me a better answer.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER My dear lord,</p>
<p>You know the fiery quality of the duke,</p>
<p>How unremovable and fixed he is</p>
<p>In his own course.</p>
<p>LEAR Vengeance, plague, death, confusion 775 !</p>
<p>Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,</p>
<p>I’d speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Well, my good lord, I have informed them so.</p>
<p>LEAR Informed them? Dost thou understand me, man?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p>LEAR The king would speak with Cornwall: the dear father</p>
<p>Would with his daughter speak, commands, tends 776 , service.</p>
<p>Are they informed of this? My breath and blood!</p>
<p>Fiery? The fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that —</p>
<p>No, but not yet: maybe he is not well.</p>
<p>Infirmity doth still neglect all office</p>
<p>Whereto our health is bound 777 : we are not ourselves</p>
<p>When nature, being oppressed 778 , commands the mind</p>
<p>To suffer with the body. I’ll forbear,</p>
<p>And am fallen out with my more headier will 779 ,</p>
<p>To take the indisposed and sickly fit</p>
<p>For the sound 780 man. Death on my state 781 ! Wherefore</p>
<p>Sees Kent</p>
<p>Should he sit here? This act persuades me</p>
<p>That this remotion 782 of the duke and her</p>
<p>Is practice 783 only. Give me my servant forth 784 .</p>
<p>Go tell the duke and’s 785 wife I’d speak with them,</p>
<p>Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,</p>
<p>Or at their chamber-door I’ll beat the drum</p>
<p>Till it cry sleep to death.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER I would have all well betwixt you.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>LEAR O me, my heart, my rising heart! But, down!</p>
<p>FOOL Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney 786 did to the eels when she
put ‘em i’th’paste alive 787 : she knapped 788 ’em o’th’coxcombs 789
with a stick and cried ’Down, wantons 790 , down!’ ’Twas her brother
that, in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay 791 .</p>
<p>Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants</p>
<p>LEAR Good morrow to you both.</p>
<p>CORNWALL Hail to your grace!</p>
<p>Kent here set at liberty</p>
<p>REGAN I am glad to see your highness.</p>
<p>LEAR Regan, I think you are. I know what reason</p>
<p>I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,</p>
<p>I would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb,</p>
<p>Sepulch’ring 792 an adult’ress 793 .— O, are you free?</p>
<p>To Kent</p>
<p>Some other time for that.— Belovèd Regan,</p>
<p>Thy sister’s naught 794 : O Regan, she hath tied</p>
<p>Sharp-toothed unkindness, like a vulture 795 , here.</p>
<p>Points to his heart</p>
<p>I can scarce speak to thee. Thou’lt not believe</p>
<p>With how depraved a quality — O Regan!</p>
<p>REGAN I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope</p>
<p>You less know how to value her desert</p>
<p>Than she to scant her duty 796 .</p>
<p>LEAR Say? How is that?</p>
<p>REGAN I cannot think my sister in the least</p>
<p>Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance</p>
<p>She have restrained the riots of your followers,</p>
<p>’Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end</p>
<p>As clears her from all blame.</p>
<p>LEAR My curses on her!</p>
<p>REGAN O, sir, you are old:</p>
<p>Nature in you stands on the very verge</p>
<p>Of her confine 797 : you should be ruled and led</p>
<p>By some discretion 798 that discerns your state 799</p>
<p>Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,</p>
<p>That to our sister you do make return:</p>
<p>Say you have wronged her.</p>
<p>LEAR Ask her forgiveness?</p>
<p>Do you but mark how this becomes the house 800 :</p>
<p>Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>Age is unnecessary 801 . On my knees I beg</p>
<p>That you’ll vouchsafe 802 me raiment 803 , bed and food.</p>
<p>REGAN Good sir, no more: these are unsightly tricks:</p>
<p>Return you to my sister.</p>
<p>LEAR Never, Regan:</p>
<p>Rises</p>
<p>She hath abated 804 me of half my train,</p>
<p>Looked black upon me, struck me with her tongue</p>
<p>Most serpent-like upon the very heart.</p>
<p>All the stored vengeances of heaven fall</p>
<p>On her ingrateful top 805 ! Strike her young bones,</p>
<p>You taking 806 airs, with lameness—</p>
<p>CORNWALL Fie, sir, fie!</p>
<p>LEAR You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames</p>
<p>Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,</p>
<p>You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun</p>
<p>To fall and blister 807 !</p>
<p>REGAN O the blest gods! So will you wish on me</p>
<p>When the rash mood is on.</p>
<p>LEAR No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:</p>
<p>Thy tender-hafted 808 nature shall not give</p>
<p>Thee o’er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce, but thine</p>
<p>Do comfort and not burn. ’Tis not in thee</p>
<p>To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,</p>
<p>To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes 809 ,</p>
<p>And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt 810</p>
<p>Against my coming in: thou better know’st</p>
<p>The offices of nature 811 , bond of childhood,</p>
<p>Effects 812 of courtesy, dues of gratitude:</p>
<p>Thy half o’th’kingdom hast thou not forgot,</p>
<p>Wherein I thee endowed.</p>
<p>REGAN Good sir, to th’purpose 813 .</p>
<p>Tucket within</p>
<p>LEAR Who put my man i’th’stocks?</p>
<p>Enter Steward [Oswald ]</p>
<p>CORNWALL What trumpet’s that?</p>
<p>REGAN I know’t my sister’s: this approves 814 her letter,</p>
<p>That she would soon be here.— Is your lady come?</p>
<p>To Oswald</p>
<p>LEAR This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed 815 pride</p>
<p>Dwells in the sickly 816 grace 817 of her he follows.—</p>
<p>Out, varlet, from my sight!</p>
<p>CORNWALL What means your grace?</p>
<p>Enter Goneril</p>
<p>LEAR Who stocked my servant? Regan, I have good hope</p>
<p>Thou didst not know on’t 818 . Who comes here? O heavens,</p>
<p>If you do love old men, if your sweet sway 819</p>
<p>Allow 820 obedience, if you yourselves are old,</p>
<p>Make it your cause, send down, and take my part!—</p>
<p>Art not ashamed to look upon this beard 821 ?—</p>
<p>To Goneril</p>
<p>O Regan, will you take her by the hand?</p>
<p>Regan and Goneril join hands</p>
<p>GONERIL Why not by th’hand, sir? How have I offended?</p>
<p>All’s not offence that indiscretion 822 finds</p>
<p>And dotage terms so.</p>
<p>LEAR O sides 823 , you are too tough!</p>
<p>Will you yet hold?— How came my man i’th’stocks?</p>
<p>CORNWALL I set him there, sir: but his own disorders 824</p>
<p>Deserved much less advancement 825 .</p>
<p>LEAR You? Did you?</p>
<p>REGAN I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.</p>
<p>If till the expiration of your month,</p>
<p>You will return and sojourn with my sister,</p>
<p>Dismissing half your train, come then to me:</p>
<p>I am now from home, and out of that provision</p>
<p>Which shall be needful for your entertainment 826 .</p>
<p>LEAR Return to her? And fifty men dismissed?</p>
<p>No, rather I abjure 827 all roofs, and choose</p>
<p>To wage against the enmity o’th’air 828 ,</p>
<p>To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,</p>
<p>Necessity’s 829 sharp pinch! Return with her?</p>
<p>Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took</p>
<p>Our youngest born, I could as well be brought</p>
<p>To knee 830 his throne and, squire-like 831 , pension 832 beg</p>
<p>To keep base life afoot 833 . Return with her?</p>
<p>Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter 834</p>
<p>To this detested groom 835 .</p>
<p>Points at Oswald</p>
<p>GONERIL At your choice, sir.</p>
<p>LEAR I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.</p>
<p>I will not trouble thee, my child, farewell:</p>
<p>We’ll no more meet, no more see one another.</p>
<p>But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter —</p>
<p>Or rather a disease that’s in my flesh,</p>
<p>Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,</p>
<p>A plague-sore, or embossèd carbuncle 836 ,</p>
<p>In my corrupted blood 837 . But I’ll not chide thee:</p>
<p>Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:</p>
<p>I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,</p>
<p>Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.</p>
<p>Mend 838 when thou canst, be better at thy leisure:</p>
<p>I can be patient, I can stay with Regan,</p>
<p>I and my hundred knights.</p>
<p>REGAN Not altogether so:</p>
<p>I looked not for 839 you yet, nor am provided</p>
<p>For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister,</p>
<p>For those that mingle reason with your passion 840</p>
<p>Must be content to think you old, and so —</p>
<p>But she knows what she does.</p>
<p>LEAR Is this well spoken?</p>
<p>REGAN I dare avouch 841 it, sir: what, fifty followers?</p>
<p>Is it not well? What should you need of more?</p>
<p>Yea, or so many, sith that 842 both charge and danger 843</p>
<p>Speak gainst so great a number? How in one house</p>
<p>Should many people under two commands</p>
<p>Hold amity? ’Tis hard, almost impossible.</p>
<p>GONERIL Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance</p>
<p>From those that she calls servants, or from mine?</p>
<p>REGAN Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack ye 844 ,</p>
<p>We could control 845 them. If you will come to me —</p>
<p>For now I spy a danger — I entreat you</p>
<p>To bring but five-and-twenty: to no more</p>
<p>Will I give place or notice 846 .</p>
<p>LEAR I gave you all—</p>
<p>REGAN And in good time you gave it 847 .</p>
<p>LEAR Made you my guardians, my depositaries 848 ,</p>
<p>But kept a reservation 849 to be followed</p>
<p>With such a number. What, must I come to you</p>
<p>With five-and-twenty? Regan, said you so?</p>
<p>REGAN And speak’t again, my lord: no more with me.</p>
<p>LEAR Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favoured 850</p>
<p>When others are more wicked: not being the worst</p>
<p>Stands in some rank of praise 851 .— I’ll go with thee:</p>
<p>To Goneril</p>
<p>Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,</p>
<p>And thou art twice her love.</p>
<p>GONERIL Hear me, my lord:</p>
<p>What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,</p>
<p>To follow in a house where twice so many</p>
<p>Have a command to tend you?</p>
<p>REGAN What need one?</p>
<p>LEAR O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars</p>
<p>Are in the poorest thing superfluous 852 :</p>
<p>Allow not 853 nature more than nature needs,</p>
<p>Man’s life is cheap as beast’s. Thou art a lady;</p>
<p>If only to go warm were gorgeous 854 ,</p>
<p>Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st 855 ,</p>
<p>Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But for true need —</p>
<p>You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!</p>
<p>You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,</p>
<p>As full of grief as age, wretched in both.</p>
<p>If it be you that stirs these daughters’ hearts</p>
<p>Against their father, fool me not so much 856</p>
<p>To bear it tamely: touch me with noble anger,</p>
<p>And let not women’s weapons, water drops,</p>
<p>Stain my man’s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,</p>
<p>I will have such revenges on you both,</p>
<p>That all the world shall — I will do such things —</p>
<p>What they are yet I know not, but they shall be</p>
<p>The terrors of the earth! You think I’ll weep:</p>
<p>No, I’ll not weep: I have full cause of weeping,</p>
<p>Storm and tempest</p>
<p>But this heart shall break into a hundred thousand flaws 857 ,</p>
<p>Or ere 858 I’ll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!</p>
<p>Exeunt [Lear, Gloucester, Kent and Fool ]</p>
<p>CORNWALL Let us withdraw: ’twill be a storm.</p>
<p>REGAN This house is little: the old man and’s 859 people</p>
<p>Cannot be well bestowed 860 .</p>
<p>GONERIL ’Tis his own blame 861 hath put himself from rest 862</p>
<p>And must needs taste his folly.</p>
<p>REGAN For his particular 863 , I’ll receive him gladly,</p>
<p>But not one follower.</p>
<p>GONERIL So am I purposed.</p>
<p>Where is my lord of Gloucester?</p>
<p>Enter Gloucester</p>
<p>CORNWALL Followed the old man forth: he is returned.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER The king is in high rage.</p>
<p>CORNWALL Whither is he going?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER He calls to horse, but will 864 I know not whither.</p>
<p>CORNWALL ’Tis best to give him way 865 : he leads himself.</p>
<p>GONERIL My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Alack, the night comes on, and the high winds</p>
<p>Do sorely ruffle 866 , for many miles about</p>
<p>There’s scarce a bush.</p>
<p>REGAN O, sir, to wilful men</p>
<p>The injuries that they themselves procure 867</p>
<p>Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:</p>
<p>He is attended with a desperate train 868 ,</p>
<p>And what they may incense him to, being apt</p>
<p>To have his ear abused 869 , wisdom bids fear.</p>
<p>CORNWALL Shut up your doors, my lord, ’tis a wild night.</p>
<p>My Regan counsels well: come out o’th’storm.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
