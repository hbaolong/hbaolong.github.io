<h4 id="introduction-to-the-two-parts-of-henry-the-fourth">Introduction
to The Two Parts of Henry the Fourth</h4>
<p>Shakespeare’s art of mingling comedy, history and tragedy reached its
peak in the two parts of King Henry the Fourth . As history, the plays
paint a panorama of England, embracing a wider social range than any
previous historical drama as the action moves from court to tavern,
council chamber to battlefield, city to country, Archbishop and Lord
Chief Justice to whore and thief. As comedy, they tell the story of a
prodigal son’s journey from youth to maturity and an old rogue’s art of
surviving by means of jokes, tall tales and the art of being not only
witty in himself but ‘the cause that wit is in other men’. As tragedy,
they reveal the slow decline of a king who cannot escape his past, the
precipitate demise of an impetuous young warrior who embodies both the
glory and the futility of military heroism, and the heart-breaking
dismissal of a substitute father who has loved a prince with a warmth of
which his true father is incapable.</p>
<p>Richard II had followed the tragic pattern of a mismatch between the
character of a man of high estate and the demands of his position as a
ruler. It juxtaposed the fall of King Richard to the rise of Henry
Bullingbrook, comparing them to a pair of buckets on a pulley, one
descending into a well as the other ascends. Once Bullingbrook has
become King Henry IV, the pattern is reasserted and reversed in the next
generation. Henry sees his son seeming to become another Richard, a
time-waster surrounding himself with unsuitable companions and allowing
the country to run to seed. He sees himself – a soldier, a man of
decision and action – not in his son, but in Hotspur, child of the Percy
family who had helped him to displace Richard from the throne.</p>
<p>Historically, Henry Percy, known as Hotspur, was over twenty years
older than Prince Henry (usually called Harry and, by Falstaff alone,
Hal), the future King Henry V, victor of Agincourt. With his habitual
dramatic licence, Shakespeare altered history and made them rival youths
of the same generation. Henry IV’s nightmare of history repeating itself
is that Hotspur will play his own role to his son’s Richard. He wishes
that ‘some night-tripping fairy’ had exchanged the two Harries in their
cradles ‘And called mine Percy, his [i.e. Northumberland’s]
Plantagenet.’ But this time it is the rebel who falls and the true heir
who succeeds. Henry the Fourth , a double-header of a play, is full of
doubles. There are paired fathers and sons: the king and the prince,
Northumberland and Hotspur. There are surrogate fathers to the young
hero: Sir John Falstaff and the Lord Chief Justice. There are brothers
in blood (Prince Harry and Prince John, Northumberland and Worcester,
Hotspur and his brother-in-law Mortimer, the aged kinsmen Shallow and
Silence) and brothers in jest (Hal’s ‘sworn brethren’ among the tavern
crowd, Ned Poins chief among them).</p>
<p>One of the questions that fascinates Shakespeare in these plays
concerns the appropriate education for a future king. The Tudor view was
that the ideal king should combine the qualities of soldier, scholar and
courtier. Fencing, jousting and hunting offered training in the
chivalric arts of the medieval aristocracy, but a learned humanist tutor
was also required to drill the prince in languages, literature, history,
ethics, law and theology. And at the same time it was necessary to
master the elaborate codes of behaviour, the conventions of propriety
and deference, upon which courtship depended.</p>
<p>Hotspur is the embodiment of an old-style chivalric warrior. He would
rather be astride his horse than engaging in courtly parley with his
wife. He lives by the code of honour and is deliciously scornful of the
courtly manners embodied by the trimly dressed, clean-shaven lord who
comes with ‘pouncet-box’ in hand to demand Hotspur’s prisoners: the
clash of styles between battlefield and court is enough to turn him into
a rebel. Hotspur has boundless courage and energy, but his desire ‘To
pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon’ is susceptible to parody:
his own wife teases him and Prince Hal mocks him as ‘the Hotspur of the
north, he that kills me some six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast,
washes his hands, and says to his wife “Fie upon this quiet life! I want
work.“’ His impulsiveness means that he cannot calculate, he is never
the politician. ‘A plague upon it, / I have forgot the map!’ he says
during a council of war. A more politic tactician would be most unlikely
to have forgotten it – and would never admit as much if he had.</p>
<p>As Hotspur embodies the old chivalric code, his fellow-warrior the
Welshman Glendower stands for an equally antiquated mode of being:
magical thinking. He boasts of portents at his birth – fiery shapes in
the air and goats running from the mountain – but this kind of talk is
ridiculed. When he claims that he ‘can call spirits from the vasty
deep’, Hotspur wryly asks ‘But will they come when you do call for
them?’ Talk of dragons and finless fish is ‘skimble-skamble stuff’ which
does nothing to advance the cause of the rebellion. In the end, the
consequence of Glendower’s desire to listen to prophecies is that he
fails to turn up for the battle.</p>
<p>The First Part shows Prince Harry playing ‘truant’ from ‘chivalry’,
but returning to it when the time is ripe. Even as he proves himself on
the battlefield, the critique of honour continues with Falstaff’s mock
‘catechism’: ‘Can honour set to a leg? No … Who hath it? He that died
o’Wednesday.’ Falstaff’s philosophy is a simple ‘give me life’: never
mind about ethical and political codes of behaviour. ‘I am not a double
man’, he says to Hal, putting down the dead Hotspur, whom he has been
carrying on his back. Yet he is double the size of anyone else in the
play and he has a double life, rising from feigned death on the
battlefield of Shrewsbury so that he can return in The Second Part . It
will be altogether harder to get rid of cowardly Falstaff than to defeat
brave Hotspur. ‘Thou art not what thou seem’st’, remarks Hal: in seeming
to have killed Hotspur, Falstaff is not the coward he has appeared to
be. But he has not slain Hotspur, merely stabbed him when he is already
dead – a supremely dishonourable deed. And yet what is honour? A mere
word, an empty code. It is the trickster, the chancer, who survives, not
the honourable man.</p>
<p>Falstaff is at once the great deceiver and the great truth-teller,
who reduces war to its bottom line: common foot-soldiers are but ‘food
for powder’. One of the reasons why Shakespeare made him fat was to
remind the audience of the solidity of the human body: Falstaff’s girth
is a way of saying that history is made not only of big speeches and
dramatic events, but also of the daily lives of people who eat, drink,
sleep and die: ‘Rare words! Brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come! /
O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!’</p>
<p>A key word in The First Part is ‘instinct’. Hotspur has instinctive
courage and Falstaff an instinctive sense of self-preservation. The king
thinks that his son is instinctively idle and irresponsible. The aim of
a sixteenth-century royal humanist education was to overcome such innate
propensities by developing the ethical, linguistic and political
faculties of the pupil prince. For Hal, the King’s Tavern in Eastcheap
serves as a parody of the schoolroom at court. Falstaff is explicitly
identified as his ‘tutor’ and a central part of his education is to
learn a new language – not, however, Latin, Greek or the rhetorical
elaboration of courtly speech, but the language of the people. This is a
Harry who develops the art of speaking with every ‘Tom, Dick and
Francis’. He learns their jargon – ‘They call drinking deep, dyeing
scarlet’ – and becomes ‘so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour’
that he will be able to ‘drink with any tinker in his own language’ for
the rest of his life. Henry IV believes that one of the failings of his
predecessor Richard II was to seek to make himself popular, thus eroding
the necessary distance that creates awe and gives mystique to the
monarchy. But his own distance from public life – he is nearly always
surrounded by an inner circle of courtiers or closeted alone in his
chamber – causes power to ebb from him. His son, by contrast, comes to
know the common people, developing a rapport that will enable him to
inspire and lead his army in Henry V . The point is made through the
very linguistic medium of the drama: all Shakespeare’s other English
kings speak entirely in verse, whereas Prince Hal has command of a
flexible prose voice, with which he reduces himself to the level of his
people, an Eastcheap trick that he repeats when he goes in disguise
among his men on the night before the battle of Agincourt.</p>
<p>The prince succeeds according to the principle articulated by the
cunning politician Ulysses in Troilus and Cressida : a man ‘Cannot make
boast to have that which he hath, / Nor feels not what he owes, but by
reflection, / As when his virtues shining upon others / Heat them and
they retort that heat again / To the first giver.’ That is to say, we
can only make value judgements through a process of comparison. ‘Percy
is but my factor, good my lord, / To engross up glorious deeds on my
behalf’: by temporarily ceding glory to Henry Hotspur, Henry Monmouth
will seem all the more glorious when he eventually triumphs over him.
His whole strategy is revealed in the imagery of his first soliloquy:
the sun seems brighter after cloud and a jewel on a dull background will
‘show more goodly and attract more eyes / Than that which hath no foil
to set it off.’ The offsetting of the prince against his various foils
is the structural key to the drama.</p>
<p>Prince Harry is a man of the future; his father is haunted by the
past. Both parts of Henry the Fourth are suffused with the memory of the
‘by-paths and indirect crooked ways’ by which Bullingbrook ‘met’ (or
rather took) the crown. The king is revealed at his most vulnerable
halfway through The Second Part , in a scene that may have troubled the
censor: sick and sleepless, he meditates on the cares of state, the
fragility of office and the weight of his past sin. A usurper himself,
Henry IV has no ground on which to base his authority over the rebels
who were once his allies. The only basis of his power is victory on the
battlefield. In each part, this is achieved by means of a trick. At
Shrewsbury in The First Part , the device consists of dressing several
different men as the king in order to confuse the enemy. Having slain
one of the impersonators, Douglas assumes that he is addressing another
of them: ‘What art thou, / That counterfeit’st the person of a king?’
This time, however, it is the king, not a counterfeit – which
beautifully dramatizes the point that the king is a counterfeit because
of his usurpation. In The Second Part , the king is too sick to fight
his own battle, so at Gaultree Forest the machiavellian strategy of
reneging upon the terms of a negotiated truce is carried out by his
second son, Prince John of Lancaster. Does that make Prince Harry into
the true follower of Machiavelli, who advised that the effective prince
is one who gets someone else to do his dirty work for him?</p>
<p>At the beginning of The First Part , the king says that he must
postpone his crusade to the Holy Land because of the new civil broils at
home, the fresh wound upon the earth of England. His dream of expiating
his sins by liberating Jerusalem from the heathen is never translated
into action. The prophecy that he would end his life there is only
realized ironically: he dies in the ‘Jerusalem chamber’ of his own
palace. Henry IV’s fear, apparently borne out by the bad company that
Prince Harry keeps, is that the sin of the father will be visited upon
the reign of his son:</p>
<p>For the fifth Harry from curbed licence plucks</p>
<p>The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog</p>
<p>Shall flesh his tooth in every innocent.</p>
<p>O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!</p>
<p>When that my care could not withhold thy riots,</p>
<p>What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?</p>
<p>O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,</p>
<p>Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!</p>
<p>He imagines that the ‘riot’ of the wayward prince will be translated
into civil disorder when he becomes king. That is also Falstaff’s hope
on hearing that his beloved Hal is now Henry V: ‘the laws of England are
at my commandment … and woe unto my Lord Chief Justice!’ But he is in
for a shock: Hal immediately adopts Falstaff’s adversary, the Lord Chief
Justice, as his new surrogate father. As in The First Part he had
startled the rebels by transforming himself from tavern idler to armed
warrior on horseback, so now in The Second Part he proves that he has
learned the civic virtues as well as the military ones.</p>
<p>The prince’s self-revelatory soliloquy early in The First Part began
with the words ‘I know you all’. The newly-crowned king’s rejection of
Falstaff late in The Second Part begins with the words ‘I know thee not,
old man.’ The verbal echo is unmistakable: he has ceased to be Hal, he
is now delivering on his promise that the time would come when he would
throw off the companions and misleaders of his youth. As predicted in
the soliloquy, Harry has succeeded in falsifying men’s hopes. His
reformation glitters over his fault. Falstaff and company suddenly seem
to be no more than instruments in a princely conjuring trick, a
theatrical act of self-transformation designed to impress a public
audience.</p>
<p>Radically opposing interpretations thus become possible. By one
account, the politic march of history stands in violent contrast to the
humane virtues of friendship, loyalty, good humour, sociability, verbal
inventiveness, self-mockery, loyalty and love. Humanity gives way to
what the Bastard in King John called ‘commodity’. The alternative view
is that Falstaff embodies the temptations of the flesh. He scores highly
for at least three of the seven deadly sins – gluttony, lust and sloth.
He is the ‘Vice’ figure of the old tradition of morality plays and his
rejection is accordingly Hal’s final step on the path towards political
and moral redemption. So it is that Hal can be played equally
persuasively as a young man going on a journey towards maturity but
still enjoying his departures from the straight and narrow path or as
one of Shakespeare’s machiavellian manipulators – energetic and
intellectually astute, a brilliant actor, but intensely self-conscious,
emotionally reined in.</p>
<p>It is not known whether Shakespeare always intended Henry the Fourth
to be a two-part play or whether he discovered at some point in the
writing or production of The First Part that it would be dramatically
unsatisfying to contain a double climax in a single play, to have Prince
Harry prove himself a chivalric hero by defeating Hotspur on the
battlefield and then immediately dissociate himself from Falstaff and
the other thieves. Instead, the rejection of Falstaff is withheld until
The Second Part , but anticipated in the play-within-the-play in The
First Part , where the prince’s return to his father is pre-enacted in
the tavern.</p>
<p>The scene is a glorious piece of improvised theatre, with the actors
changing roles and parodying different linguistic registers. Thus, for
instance, when Falstaff plays King Henry he apes the affected courtly
prose style of John Lyly: ‘for though the camomile, the more it is
trodden the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the sooner
it wears’. It is a mark of Shakespeare’s attention to detail that when
Falstaff is playing the king he calls the prince ‘Harry’ instead of his
pet-name ‘Hal’. Though the language of the mock-play is intricate and
varied, the staging is simple: ‘This chair shall be my state, this
dagger my sceptre and this cushion my crown.’ The metatheatrical effect
reminds the audience that they are in a theatre and at the same time
suggests that power is itself a form of theatre. There is no intrinsic
reason why a golden crown is sacred and a stuffed cushion anarchic;
whether in a theatre or a palace, a throne may represent a ‘chair of
state’ but it is still a mere chair.</p>
<p>A chair is a chair and, as Gadshill puts it, ‘Homo is a common name
to all men.’ Falstaff may be ‘that reverend Vice, that grey Iniquity,
that father Ruffian, that Vanity in years’, but he is also the
embodiment of the shared frailty of all humanity: ‘If sack and sugar be
a fault, heaven help the wicked: if to be old and merry be a sin, then
many an old host that I know is damned.’ To banish plump Jack is to
banish ‘all the world’. ‘I do’, says Hal, playing the role of his father
the king; ‘I will’, he adds, anticipating what he will do when he
becomes king himself. As so often when Shakespeare’s art is working in
its most concentrated form, judgement is left suspended. Is Hal
‘essentially made’, with or without knowing it? And is it possible to be
a true friend and a true prince? At the end of the ‘play extempore’, he
is friend more than prince, lying to an authority figure, the sheriff,
in order to protect Falstaff. So is he – as some editors emend –
‘essentially mad’, fundamentally as opposed to temporarily a ‘madcap’?
‘The true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false thief’, says
Falstaff: is the play-time of ‘recreation’ a space for a brief interlude
of misrule or a crucible in which the self is re-created?</p>
<p>There is little historical warrant for the story of Henry V’s riotous
youth. A ‘prodigal son’ narrative was attached to him in the chronicles
and the anonymous play The Famous Victories of Henry the Fifth in order
to highlight the change he undergoes when he becomes king, submits to
the rule of law and so unifies and brings to order the nation that his
father divided. The rejection of Falstaff and company is part and parcel
of Harry’s symbolically becoming a new person at the moment of his
coronation. The notion of ‘reformation’ and the washing away of past
iniquities clearly have strong religious connotations. Each time the
prince returns to the court, he speaks a language of ‘fall’ and
‘pardon’. When he fights well, his father tells him that ‘Thou hast
redeemed thy lost opinion.’</p>
<p>The rhythm of Prince Hal’s life is that of providential history,
leading to his ‘reformation’ and his assumption of the roles which
attracted Queen Elizabeth to him: unifier of the body-politic, victor
over a rival kingdom, heroic leader of a great and independent nation.
The rhythm of Falstaff’s life is that of the body and the seasons. In
The Second Part he journeys into the deep England of Justice Shallow’s
Gloucestershire orchard. The immemorial quality of the rural world
animated by Shallow’s ramblings – his talk that is strangely profound in
its very triviality – summons up an England that is older and more
stable than anything possible in the court-world of intrigue, innovation
and reversal. To a far greater degree than any previous play, Henry the
Fourth brings the lives of ordinary people into history. The scene with
the carriers in The First Part is a miniature of ordinary working-day
life and common speech (‘This house is turned upside down since Robin
the ostler died’), while the Gloucestershire sequence in The Second Part
is miraculously detailed. Shallow’s kinsman Silence has come over from
Lincolnshire to stay and so provides an opportunity for the exchange of
gossip (‘How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford Fair? … Is old Double
of your town living yet?’) and the sharing of reminiscence, which
Falstaff then participates in (‘We have heard the chimes at midnight,
Master Shallow’). The pace of the action slows in a gesture of respect
to the old, even as we laugh at them.</p>
<p>We learn from Shallow that Falstaff began his career as page to
Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk. This appears to be a Shakespearean
fancy without source: it is true of neither the historical Sir John
Falstaff, who flees the battlefield in 1 Henry VI , nor the historical
Sir John Oldcastle, of whom the character of Falstaff was originally an
irreverent portrait. Why did Shakespeare give his fictional Falstaff a
past that began in the service of Mowbray? At one level, it links him
with opposition to the Lancastrian ascendancy represented by King Henry
IV and his son. Mowbray was Henry IV’s opponent when the latter was
still Bullingbrook, back at the beginning of Richard II . Like father,
like son: as Bullingbrook’s accusation of treachery was instrumental in
the banishment of Mowbray from the land, so Hal will banish Falstaff
from his presence. Mowbray departs with a moving farewell to his native
land and language; the effect of his words is to suggest that love of
the English earth and the English word goes deeper than dynastic
difference. We do not hear similar patriotic sentiments in the mouth of
the self-interested Bullingbrook; he does nothing to bring back the old
England idealized in the death-bed speech of his father, John of Gaunt
(whose name and whose England are also remembered by Shallow).</p>
<p>In Shakespeare’s own time, those who suffered banishment because of
ideological difference, but who claimed that they were nevertheless
loyal to England, were predominantly Catholics. And this suggests
another level to the allusion that binds Falstaff to the Duke of
Norfolk. To an Elizabethan audience, the name of Norfolk – the only
surviving dukedom in the land – was synonymous with overt or suspected
Catholic sympathy. The old Catholic ways persisted in the country long
after the official change of religion inaugurated by Henry VIII’s break
from Rome. The Catholic liturgy’s integral relationship with the
agricultural calendar and the cycles of human biology could not be
shattered overnight. There may, then, be a sense in which Falstaff’s
journey into deep England is also a journey into the old religion of
Shakespeare’s father and maternal grandfather. One wonders if it is a
coincidence that, in fleshing out the skeletal character of the prince’s
riotous companion which he inherited from the old play of The Famous
Victories of Henry the Fifth , Shakespeare retained and made much of his
own father’s name of John. It is ironic that Falstaff’s original
surname, Oldcastle, had to be changed because the character was regarded
as an insult to the memory of the proto-Protestant Lollard of that name:
‘for Oldcastle died martyr’, says the epilogue to The Second Part , ‘and
this is not the man’.</p>
<p>Indeed it is not the man, for Falstaff is if anything an embodiment
of those ancient Catholic rhythms which were suppressed in the name of
Reformation. Vestiges of Oldcastle litter the text: ‘Falstaff sweats to
death’ suggests a martyr burning on a bonfire and ‘if I become not a
cart as well as another man’ could suggest a religious dissident on the
way to the stake as well as a criminal being taken to the gallows.
Protestants, especially in the extreme form of puritans, were
traditionally lean; fat monks were symbolic of the corruptions of
Catholicism. By making Sir John fat and not calling him Oldcastle,
Shakespeare raises the spectre of Catholic as opposed to Protestant
martyrdoms. Falstaff is Malvolio’s opposite: he stands for cakes and
ale, festival and holiday, all that was anathema to puritanism. At the
beginning of Henry V , the Archbishop of Canterbury confirms that Prince
Harry’s transformation was completed with the rejection of Falstaff:
‘Never came reformation in a flood, / With such a heady currance,
scouring faults.’ If there is a proto-Protestant or embryonic puritan in
the plays, it is King Harry the Fifth, newly washed of his past, casting
off his old companions, turning away England’s former self.</p>
<p>Even as he uses Hal for his own advancement, Falstaff is always a
truer father than the cold and politic King Henry IV can ever be. The
point is made with beautiful clarity by the contrast between Falstaff’s
heated engagement in the scene in which he and Hal act out the prodigal
prince’s forthcoming interview with his father and the king’s chilly
detachment in the interview itself. The complexity and the pain of the
end of The Second Part stem from the way in which, by casting himself as
the prodigal son and coming home to his politic heritage, Hal tears into
the heart of old England. According to Holinshed’s Chronicles , King
Henry V left no friendship unrewarded. This cannot be said of
Shakespeare’s version of history. ‘Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand
pound’, says Falstaff immediately after he has been publicly denounced
by his ‘sweet boy’, changing the subject in the way that people often do
when they feel betrayed or bewildered. At this moment, the spectator who
has attended carefully to both parts may remember an earlier exchange
when Hal asks ‘Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?’ and Falstaff
replies ‘A thousand pound, Hal? A million. Thy love is worth a million:
thou ow’st me thy love.’</p>
<p>In the epilogue to The Second Part , Shakespeare promises that ‘our
humble author will continue the story with Sir John in it, and make you
merry with fair Katherine of France’. Audience members attending Henry V
on the basis of this promise might be justified in asking for their
money back: we do not see Sir John Falstaff in the Agincourt play. His
presence would raise too many awkward questions of the ‘reformed’ king.
We only hear – most comically and at the same time most movingly – of
his death. The king has broken his heart.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS: THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE FOURTH</p>
<p>PLOT: After deposing King Richard II, Henry Bullingbrook has ascended
the throne as Henry IV. Guilt about the desposition troubles his
conscience, and the stability of his reign is threatened by growing
opposition from some of the nobles who helped him to the throne. His
son, Prince Henry (also known as Harry and, by Falstaff, as Hal), is
living a dissolute life, frequenting the taverns of Eastcheap in the
company of Sir John Falstaff and other disreputable characters, with
whom he participates in a highway robbery. Opposition to the king
becomes open rebellion, led by the Earl of Northumberland’s son Henry
Percy, known for his courage and impetuous nature as Hotspur. The Percy
family support the claim to the throne of Hotspur’s brother-in-law,
Edmund Mortimer. The rebellion brings Hal back to his father’s side,
while Falstaff musters a ragged troop of soldiers. The king’s army
defeat the rebels at the battle of Shrewsbury, where Hal kills Hotspur.
Falstaff lives to die another day.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage) Falstaff (20%/ 151/8), Prince Henry (18%/170/10), Hotspur
(18%/102/8), King Henry (11%/30/6), Worcester (6%/35/7), Poins
(3%/36/3), Glendower (3%/23/1). Several characters speak between 15 and
30 of the play’s 3,000 lines: Douglas, Hostess Quickly, Gadshill,
Vernon, Mortimer, Lady Percy, Bardolph, Blunt, Northumberland,
Westmorland, Francis.</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 55% verse, 45% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: Probably written and first performed 1596–97; registered for
publication February 1598. Falstaff’s name was originally Oldcastle; it
was probably changed to Falstaff either during the months when William
Brooke, Lord Cobham (an indirect descendant of the historical Sir John
Oldcastle), was Lord Chamberlain (August 1596 to March 1597) or
following the suppression of playing (July–October 1597) caused by a
politically inflammatory play called The Isle of Dogs .</p>
<p>SOURCES: Based on the account of the reign of Henry IV in the 1587
edition of Holinshed’s Chronicles , with some use of Samuel Daniel’s
epic poem The First Four Books of the Civil Wars (1595). Thus, for
instance, the historical Hotspur was twenty years older than Hal, but
Daniel made them contemporaries for dramatic effect. The intermingling
of historical materials and comedy, in the context of the prince’s
riotous youth, is developed from the anonymous Queen’s Men play, The
Famous Victories of Henry the Fifth (performed late 1580s), which
includes characters who may be regarded as crude prototypes of Falstaff
and Poins.</p>
<p>TEXT: Quarto 1598 (text probably based on a scribal transcript of
Shakespeare’s manuscript; two printings, one of them lost save for a few
sheets), reprinted 1599, 1604, 1608, 1613, 1622 (indicating that this
was one of Shakespeare’s most popular plays). The Folio text was set
from the Fifth Quarto, correcting some but nowhere near all of its
mistakes. Oaths were systematically removed in accordance with the 1606
Parliamentary ‘Act to restrain the Abuses of Players’: since the Act
applied to stage performances, not printed books, this suggests that a
theatrical manuscript also lay behind the Folio text. There is therefore
good reason to regard Folio as an autonomous text, with its own
authority. Our text is based on Folio, but where there are manifest
errors, either derived from the Quarto tradition or introduced by the
Folio compositors, we restore readings from the First Quarto.</p>
