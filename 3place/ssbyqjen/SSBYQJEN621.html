<h4 id="scene-6-running-scene-3-continues">Scene 6 / running scene 3
continues</h4>
<p>Enter Innogen alone</p>
<p>INNOGEN A father cruel and a stepdame 308 false,</p>
<p>A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,</p>
<p>That hath her husband banished 309 : O, that husband,</p>
<p>My supreme crown of grief, and those repeated</p>
<p>Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol’n 310 ,</p>
<p>As my two brothers, happy: but most miserable</p>
<p>Is the desire that’s glorious 311 . Blest be those,</p>
<p>How mean 312 soe’er, that have their honest wills 313 ,</p>
<p>Which seasons 314 comfort. Who may this be? Fie! 315</p>
<p>Enter Pisanio and Iachimo</p>
<p>PISANIO Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,</p>
<p>Comes from my lord with letters.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Change you 316 , madam:</p>
<p>The worthy Leonatus is in safety</p>
<p>And greets your highness dearly.</p>
<p>Presents a letter</p>
<p>INNOGEN Thanks good sir,</p>
<p>You’re kindly welcome.</p>
<p>IACHIMO All of her that is out of door 317 most rich!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>If she be furnished 318 with a mind so rare 319 ,</p>
<p>She is alone th’Arabian bird 320 , and I</p>
<p>Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend:</p>
<p>Arm me audacity 321 from head to foot,</p>
<p>Or like the Parthian I shall flying fight 322 ,</p>
<p>Rather, directly fly 323 .</p>
<p>INNOGEN Reads ’He is one of the noblest note 324 , to whose
kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect 325 upon him accordingly,
as you value your trust 326 . Leonatus.’So far 327 I read aloud.</p>
<p>But even the very middle of my heart</p>
<p>Is warmed by th’rest, and takes it thankfully.</p>
<p>You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I</p>
<p>Have words to bid you, and shall find it so</p>
<p>In all that I can do.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Thanks, fairest lady.—</p>
<p>What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes</p>
<p>To see this vaulted arch 328 and the rich crop</p>
<p>Of sea and land, which 329 can distinguish ’twixt</p>
<p>The fiery orbs 330 above and the twinned 331 stones</p>
<p>Upon th’unnumbered 332 beach, and can we not</p>
<p>Partition 333 make with spectacles so precious 334</p>
<p>’Twixt fair and foul?</p>
<p>INNOGEN What makes your admiration 335 ?</p>
<p>IACHIMO It cannot be i’th’eye: for apes and monkeys,</p>
<p>’Twixt two such shes 336 , would chatter this way 337 and</p>
<p>Contemn 338 with mows 339 the other. Nor i’th’judgement:</p>
<p>For idiots in this case of favour would</p>
<p>Be wisely definite 340 . Nor i’th’appetite 341 :</p>
<p>Sluttery 342 , to such neat 343 excellence opposed,</p>
<p>Should make desire vomit emptiness 344 ,</p>
<p>Not so allured 345 to feed 346 .</p>
<p>INNOGEN What is the matter, trow 347 ?</p>
<p>IACHIMO The cloyèd 348 will 349 ,</p>
<p>That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub</p>
<p>Both filled and running 350 , ravening 351 first the lamb,</p>
<p>Longs after for the garbage 352 .</p>
<p>INNOGEN What, dear sir,</p>
<p>Thus raps 353 you? Are you well?</p>
<p>IACHIMO Thanks, madam, well.— Beseech you, sir,</p>
<p>To Pisanio</p>
<p>Desire my man’s abode 354 where I did leave him:</p>
<p>He’s strange 355 and peevish 356 .</p>
<p>PISANIO I was going, sir,</p>
<p>To give him welcome.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>INNOGEN Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?</p>
<p>IACHIMO Well, madam.</p>
<p>INNOGEN Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Exceeding pleasant: none a stranger there</p>
<p>So merry and so gamesome 357 : he is called</p>
<p>The Briton reveller.</p>
<p>INNOGEN When he was here</p>
<p>He did incline to sadness 358 , and oft-times</p>
<p>Not knowing why.</p>
<p>IACHIMO I never saw him sad.</p>
<p>There is a Frenchman his companion, one</p>
<p>An 359 eminent monsieur, that it seems much loves</p>
<p>A Gallian 360 girl at home. He furnaces</p>
<p>The thick sighs 361 from him, whiles the jolly Briton —</p>
<p>Your lord, I mean — laughs from’s free lungs 362 : cries ’O,</p>
<p>Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows</p>
<p>By history, report or his own proof 363 ,</p>
<p>What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose</p>
<p>But must be, will’s free hours languish</p>
<p>For assurèd bondage?’</p>
<p>INNOGEN Will my lord say so?</p>
<p>IACHIMO Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:</p>
<p>It is a recreation to be by</p>
<p>And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,</p>
<p>Some men are much to blame.</p>
<p>INNOGEN Not he, I hope.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Not he: but yet heaven’s bounty towards him might</p>
<p>Be used more thankfully 364 . In himself ’tis 365 much;</p>
<p>In you, which I account 366 his, beyond all talents 367 .</p>
<p>Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound</p>
<p>To pity too.</p>
<p>INNOGEN What do you pity, sir?</p>
<p>IACHIMO Two creatures heartily.</p>
<p>INNOGEN Am I one, sir?</p>
<p>You look on me: what wreck discern you in me</p>
<p>Deserves your pity?</p>
<p>IACHIMO Lamentable! What,</p>
<p>To hide me 368 from the radiant sun, and solace</p>
<p>I’th’dungeon by a snuff 369 ?</p>
<p>INNOGEN I pray you, sir,</p>
<p>Deliver with more openness your answers</p>
<p>To my demands. Why do you pity me?</p>
<p>IACHIMO That others do —</p>
<p>I was about to say, enjoy 370 your — but</p>
<p>It is an office 371 of the gods to venge 372 it,</p>
<p>Not mine to speak on’t.</p>
<p>INNOGEN You do seem to know</p>
<p>Something of me, or what concerns me; pray you,</p>
<p>Since doubting things go ill 373 often hurts more</p>
<p>Than to be sure they do — for certainties</p>
<p>Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing 374 ,</p>
<p>The remedy then born 375 — discover to me</p>
<p>What both you spur and stop 376 .</p>
<p>IACHIMO Had 377 I this cheek</p>
<p>To bathe my lips upon: this hand, whose touch,</p>
<p>Whose every touch, would force the feeler’s 378 soul</p>
<p>To th’oath of loyalty: this object 379 , which</p>
<p>Takes prisoner the wild motion 380 of mine eye,</p>
<p>Firing 381 it only here: should I, damned then,</p>
<p>Slaver 382 with lips as common 383 as the stairs</p>
<p>That mount the Capitol 384 : join grips with hands</p>
<p>Made hard with hourly falsehood — falsehood, as</p>
<p>With labour 385 — then by-peeping 386 in an eye</p>
<p>Base and illustrous 387 as the smoky light</p>
<p>That’s fed with 388 stinking tallow 389 : it were fit 390</p>
<p>That all the plagues of hell should at one time</p>
<p>Encounter such revolt 391 .</p>
<p>INNOGEN My lord, I fear,</p>
<p>Has forgot Britain.</p>
<p>IACHIMO And himself. Not I</p>
<p>Inclined to this intelligence pronounce 392</p>
<p>The beggary of his change: but ’tis your graces</p>
<p>That from my mutest conscience to my tongue</p>
<p>Charms this report out.</p>
<p>INNOGEN Let me hear no more.</p>
<p>IACHIMO O dearest soul: your cause doth strike my heart</p>
<p>With pity that doth make me sick. A lady</p>
<p>So fair, and fastened to an empery 393</p>
<p>Would make the great’st king double 394 , to be partnered 395</p>
<p>With tomboys 396 hired with that self-exhibition 397</p>
<p>Which your own coffers yield: with diseased ventures 398</p>
<p>That play 399 with all infirmities 400 for gold</p>
<p>Which rottenness can lend nature: such boiled stuff 401</p>
<p>As well might poison poison. Be revenged,</p>
<p>Or she that bore you was no queen, and you</p>
<p>Recoil from your great stock 402 .</p>
<p>INNOGEN Revenged?</p>
<p>How should I be revenged? If this be true —</p>
<p>As I have such a heart that both mine ears</p>
<p>Must not in haste abuse — if it be true,</p>
<p>How should I be revenged?</p>
<p>IACHIMO Should he make me</p>
<p>Live like Diana’s priest 403 , betwixt cold 404 sheets,</p>
<p>Whiles he is vaulting 405 variable 406 ramps 407 ,</p>
<p>In your despite 408 , upon your purse 409 — revenge it.</p>
<p>I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,</p>
<p>More noble than that runagate 410 to your bed,</p>
<p>And will continue fast 411 to your affection,</p>
<p>Still close as sure.</p>
<p>INNOGEN What ho, Pisanio!</p>
<p>Calls</p>
<p>IACHIMO Let me my service tender on your lips 412 .</p>
<p>INNOGEN Away, I do condemn mine ears that have</p>
<p>So long attended 413 thee 414 . If thou wert honourable</p>
<p>Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not</p>
<p>For such an end thou seek’st, as base as strange.</p>
<p>Thou wrong’st a gentleman who is as far</p>
<p>From thy report as thou from honour, and</p>
<p>Solicit’st here a lady that disdains</p>
<p>Thee and the devil alike.— What ho, Pisanio!</p>
<p>The king my father shall be made acquainted</p>
<p>Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,</p>
<p>A saucy 415 stranger in his court to mart 416</p>
<p>As in a Romish stew 417 , and to expound</p>
<p>His beastly mind to us 418 , he hath a court</p>
<p>He little cares for, and a daughter who</p>
<p>He not respects at all.— What ho, Pisanio!</p>
<p>IACHIMO O happy Leonatus I may say,</p>
<p>The credit 419 that thy lady hath of thee</p>
<p>Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness</p>
<p>Her assured credit. Blessèd live you long,</p>
<p>A lady to the worthiest sir that ever</p>
<p>Country called his; and you his mistress, only</p>
<p>For the most worthiest fit. Give me your pardon.</p>
<p>I have spoke this to know if your affiance 420</p>
<p>Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord</p>
<p>That which he is new o’er 421 : and he is one</p>
<p>The truest mannered 422 , such a holy witch 423</p>
<p>That he enchants societies into him:</p>
<p>Half all men’s hearts are his.</p>
<p>INNOGEN You make amends.</p>
<p>IACHIMO He sits ’mongst men like a descended god;</p>
<p>He hath a kind of honour sets him off</p>
<p>More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,</p>
<p>Most mighty princess, that I have adventured</p>
<p>To try your taking 424 of a false report, which hath</p>
<p>Honoured with confirmation your great judgement</p>
<p>In the election of a sir so rare 425 ,</p>
<p>Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him</p>
<p>Made me to fan 426 you thus, but the gods made you,</p>
<p>Unlike all others, chaffless 427 . Pray your pardon.</p>
<p>INNOGEN All’s well, sir: take my power i’th’court for yours.</p>
<p>IACHIMO My humble thanks. I had almost forgot</p>
<p>T’entreat your grace but 428 in a small request,</p>
<p>And yet of moment 429 too, for it concerns</p>
<p>Your lord: myself and other noble friends</p>
<p>Are partners in the business.</p>
<p>INNOGEN Pray what is’t?</p>
<p>IACHIMO Some dozen Romans of us and your lord —</p>
<p>The best feather of our wing 430 — have mingled sums 431</p>
<p>To buy a present for the emperor:</p>
<p>Which I, the factor 432 for the rest, have done</p>
<p>In France: ’tis plate 433 of rare device 434 , and jewels</p>
<p>Of rich and exquisite form, their value’s great,</p>
<p>And I am something curious 435 , being strange 436 ,</p>
<p>To have them in safe stowage: may it please you</p>
<p>To take them in protection?</p>
<p>INNOGEN Willingly:</p>
<p>And pawn 437 mine honour for their safety, since</p>
<p>My lord hath interest 438 in them. I will keep them</p>
<p>In my bedchamber.</p>
<p>IACHIMO They are in a trunk</p>
<p>Attended by my men: I will make bold</p>
<p>To send them to you, only for this night:</p>
<p>I must aboard tomorrow.</p>
<p>INNOGEN O, no, no.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Yes, I beseech: or I shall short 439 my word</p>
<p>By length’ning my return. From Gallia 440</p>
<p>I crossed the seas on purpose and on promise</p>
<p>To see your grace.</p>
<p>INNOGEN I thank you for your pains:</p>
<p>But not away tomorrow.</p>
<p>IACHIMO O, I must, madam.</p>
<p>Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please</p>
<p>To greet your lord with writing, do’t tonight.</p>
<p>I have outstood 441 my time, which is material 442</p>
<p>To th’tender 443 of our present.</p>
<p>INNOGEN I will write:</p>
<p>Send your trunk to me, it shall safe be kept,</p>
<p>And truly yielded you. You’re very welcome.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
