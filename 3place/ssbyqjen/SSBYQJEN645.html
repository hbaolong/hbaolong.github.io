<h4 id="introduction-to-the-life-and-death-of-king-john">Introduction to
The Life and Death of King John</h4>
<p>During April 1811 Jane Austen was staying in London with her brother
Henry. In a letter home to her sister Cassandra, she complained of ‘a
very unlucky change of the Play for this very night – Hamlet instead of
King John – and we are to go on Monday to Macbeth instead, but it is a
disappointment to us both’. Two centuries on, we are likely to be
astonished that so discerning a woman as Jane Austen would rather have
seen King John than Hamlet or Macbeth . There is, however, a simple
explanation: Austen was a seasoned admirer of Sarah Siddons, the
greatest actress of the age, one of whose most celebrated roles was that
of the impassioned Queen Constance, as rewarding a female role as any in
the whole corpus of Shakespeare’s English history plays.</p>
<p>It was not for the wronged mother Constance alone that King John was
held in high regard in the nineteenth century. The Victorians, with
their penchant for sentiment, delighted in the pathos of the boy Arthur
persuading Hubert not to burn out his eyes with hot irons. But the
largest role, bigger than that of the vacillating king who gives the
play its title, is that of the Bastard, Philip Falconbridge. The German
Romantic critic A. W. von Schlegel was compelled by this figure: ‘He
ridicules the secret springs of politics, without disapproving of them,
for he owns that he is endeavouring to make his fortune by similar
means, and wishes rather to belong to the deceivers than the deceived,
for in his view of the world there is no other choice.’ The Bastard – a
dramatic invention, not a real historical figure – is a key character in
Shakespeare’s development of the self-serving type that reaches its
apogee with Iago in Othello and Edmund in King Lear . Yet he is the most
sympathetic male adult in the drama. He has wit and wisdom as well as
the desire for advancement. The rest are mere politicians. In its
anatomy of the mechanisms of their intrigue, King John is one of
Shakespeare’s most modern plays. Set in a feudal world where monarchs
were supposed to be God’s representatives on earth, it exposes power as
a ‘commodity’ for which men are in hungry competition.</p>
<p>The Bastard is the only character in whom the audience have
confidence because he has confidence in us. Soliloquies offer access to
his thought processes and self-conscious theatricality allows the
spectators to share his space. ‘Your royal presences be ruled by me’, he
says to two kings at once, and we enjoy his presumption because he makes
us part of the story: his lines about the citizens of Angiers, watching
from the ‘battlements’ of the stage gallery, are equally applicable to
the paying crowd ‘in a theatre, whence they gape and point / At your
industrious scenes and acts of death.’</p>
<p>‘Speak, citizens, for England’, says the King of France to the people
of Angiers as it is besieged by rival armies from opposite sides of the
English Channel. Of all Shakespeare’s history plays, King John is the
one that most explicitly asks what it might mean to speak for England.
It explores questions about legitimacy and inheritance that were of
concern to all propertied families in Tudor England, but of monumental
significance to the monarchy – especially at a time when an aged
childless queen was sitting on the throne. In the much better known play
of King Lear , the legitimate son Edgar is the virtuous one and the
illegitimate Edmund is the villain. King John imagines a more
challenging possibility: suppose that a great king dies and that his
bravest, most honest and most intelligent son is an illegitimate one. In
such a circumstance, inheritance on the basis of merit is not possible:
if a bastard were to ascend the throne, the legitimacy of the entire
monarchical system would be called into question. The seamless
interdependence of patrilineal state, law, Church and family would begin
to unravel.</p>
<p>Richard I, the Lionheart, the exemplary king, has died without a
legitimate son; the next brother in line (Geoffrey) is also dead. Who
should succeed: the next brother down ( John) or the son of the first
brother (Arthur)? As if this were not difficult enough, the question of
who speaks for England is intertwined with other debates about
legitimacy. What is the geographic limit of England’s domain – does
England retain the right to rule parts of France? And who should speak
for England’s religion? This thorny issue is focused on the appointment
of a new Archbishop of Canterbury to head the English Church. Does the
Pope have the right to impose his candidate or should the English retain
a voice in their own ecclesiastical affairs? Is there a point at which
the monarchy may legitimately reject the will of the papacy? For a Tudor
audience, a confrontation of this sort was bound to reverberate with
Henry VIII’s disputed divorce and the break from Rome in the 1530s.</p>
<p>In Protestant ideology, King John was a hero because he stood up
against papal tyranny. He was seen as a kind of Henry VIII before his
time. In the mid-sixteenth century, the Protestant zealot John Bale
wrote a court drama on these lines, while the text of Shakespeare’s
probable primary source, the anonymous two-part play The Troublesome
Reign of King John (published in 1591), is awash with raw anti-Catholic
propaganda. Shakespeare’s own play has often been read as testimony to
his Protestant allegiance: in the 1730s, at a time of anxieties about a
potential Jacobite uprising, an adaptation of it was performed in London
with the unambiguous title Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John . Yet
the authentic Shakespeare is profoundly ambiguous. There is a clear vein
of anti-Catholicism in John’s ‘no Italian priest / Shall tithe or toll
in our dominions’, together with the way in which the papal legate
Cardinal Pandulph is a scheming politician who speaks by indirections
and equivocation (‘But thou dost swear only to be forsworn, / And most
forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear’). At the same time, John is
accusingly addressed as ‘The borrowed majesty of England’ and his
equivocation hardly makes him a model ruler.</p>
<p>Back in the first scene, before there is any resolution to all the
difficult questions of succession and faith, power and proprietorship, a
sheriff enters. His presence signals the jurisdiction of the shires, the
‘country’ as opposed to the ‘court’ interest. The question of which of
two brothers will inherit a parcel of land in the shires parallels that
of which of Richard Coeur-de-lion’s brothers, John or Geoffrey (through
Arthur), will inherit the nation as a whole. Again, for the original
audience in the 1590s, an encounter set in the distant thirteenth
century would have echoed with debates in their own time, where it was
not unknown for a Member of Parliament to give voice in the House of
Commons to words that one might have expected to belong to the queen
alone: ‘I speak for all England.’ In many quarters, there was a strongly
held view that ‘England’ was not synonymous with the English queen and
her court based in and around London. Though the Tudor monarchs had
tried to unify the nation by establishing a network of legal
representatives across the shires, the ‘country’ gentry as well as the
great barons of the north and west guarded their autonomy fiercely.</p>
<p>The Bastard announces himself as a gentleman born in
Northamptonshire; he is ‘a good blunt fellow’, which is to say a
plain-speaking English countryman; later, he appeals to Saint George,
the patron saint of England. His, then, is the voice of Shakespeare’s
own place of origin, the Midlands, deep England. He is given a choice:
to inherit the Falconbridge estates or take his ‘chance’ and assume the
name, though not the patrimony, of the royal father who sired him out of
wedlock.</p>
<p>The norm in the English gentry was for the older son to inherit the
land and the younger to become mobile, to go to London and find a career
in the law, the clergy, the army, the diplomatic corps, or possibly even
the entertainment business. Settled legitimacy was pitched against the
life of the adventurer. By accepting his illegitimacy and renouncing the
land he is actually entitled to (because it was the mother’s adultery,
not the father’s, he is not forcibly disinherited in the manner of
Edmund in King Lear ), the Bastard takes the route that was usually that
of the younger brother. Shakespeare did the same when he left
Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>
<p>The Bastard’s origin in Middle England is further stressed by the
arrival of Lady Falconbridge and James Gurney, wearing riding-robes that
signify the journey from country to court. The Bastard then describes
his half-brother as ‘Colbrand the Giant, that same mighty man’. Colbrand
was a Danish invader who was defeated in single combat by Guy of Warwick
– a legendary figure who was immensely popular in chapbook, ballad and
drama. If Robert Falconbridge is symbolically Colbrand, then Philip the
Bastard is symbolically Guy, a Warwickshire folk hero. Perhaps he is
even a version of Robin Hood, with the Sheriff of Northampton standing
in for his colleague from Nottingham. Robin Hood himself, the most
famous folk hero from the reign of John, cannot be mentioned because his
name would immediately turn the king into a villain, which Shakespeare
did not want to do at the beginning of the play, both because he wanted
to keep open the question of the relative legitimacy of the claims of
John and Arthur and because he was working in that tradition of
chronicle and drama in which King John was a proto-Protestant hero
because of his refusal to allow the Pope’s nominee, Stephen Langton, to
become Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
<p>When the Pope excommunicates the English king and gives permission –
indeed promise of canonization – to anyone who conspires to kill him,
the parallels with contemporary England, where the Pope had delivered
the same sentence upon Queen Elizabeth, are impossible to ignore. So too
with the way in which the fickle French swing one way and then the other
(‘O, foul revolt of French inconstancy!’ exclaims Queen Elinor): in the
sixteenth century, France was wracked by religiously motivated civil
wars and it was well nigh impossible to guess whether the state would
end up with a Catholic or a Protestant on the throne. ‘The grappling
vigour and rough frown of war’ dominates the action of this play, just
as wars of religion and dominion in the Netherlands, Ireland and
elsewhere impinged upon the lives of Shakespeare’s audience. Like
Thersites in Troilus and Cressida , though without the vicious streak,
the Bastard anatomizes the resulting chaos of alliances and divisions:
‘Mad world, mad kings, mad composition!’</p>
<p>The Bastard stands in for Guy of Warwick, who stands in for Robin
Hood of Old England. It was Robin who maintained the values of good King
Richard at home, whilst the latter was fighting his ‘holy war’ in the
Middle East (‘Richard that robbed the lion of his heart / And fought the
holy wars in Palestine’). As the play progresses, the Bastard’s role
shifts to that of stand-in for the dead Coeur-de-lion himself. He ends
up fighting the war on John’s behalf and at one point comes within a
whisker of ascending the throne. When he speaks for England in the
closing lines, his world-weary voice is also that of his creator, who in
his Henry VI plays has shown the bloody consequences of England turning
against itself.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: King Richard I, the revered ‘Lionheart’, is dead. His brother
John has become King of England, but the French argue that the throne
should belong to the boy Arthur, son of John’s deceased older brother
Geoffrey. Matching the dispute over the throne is a dispute over
inheritance in the noble Falconbridge family. It is discovered that
Philip Falconbridge (the ‘Bastard’) is the illegitimate son of Richard
I; he is accordingly knighted ‘Sir Richard and Plantagenet’. French and
English forces fight for the town of Angiers in France; a citizen
proposes that the opponents should be united by a marriage between Lewis
the Dauphin, heir to France, and John’s niece, Lady Blanche. Arthur’s
mother Constance is furious that the French have given up on her son’s
claim. John is excommunicated for failing to agree to the Pope’s choice
for the post of Archbishop of Canterbury. The papal legate Cardinal
Pandulph stirs the French to resume war against the English. Arthur is
captured and John commissions his servant Hubert to execute the boy;
young Arthur dies from a fall while trying to escape. John changes his
mind and agrees to the Pope’s wishes. A French invasion force is
shipwrecked. John falls sick and dies. His son Henry becomes king,
though the Bastard remains the most forceful character.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Bastard (20%/89/11), King John (17%/95/9), Constance (10%/36/3),
King Philip of France (7%/44/3), Hubert (6%/52/6), Salisbury (6%/36/6),
Lewis the Dauphin (6%/28/5), Cardinal Pandulph (6%/23/4), Arthur
(5%/23/5), Pembroke (3%/20/4), Queen Elinor (2%/22/4), Blanche (2%/9/2),
Chatillon (2%/5/2).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 100% verse.</p>
<p>DATE: 1595–97? Mentioned by Meres 1598; close relationship to
anonymous two-part play The Troublesome Reign of King John (published
1591), but stylistically much closer to later histories.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Scholars dispute the play’s relationship to The Troublesome
Reign : is it the principal source or a badly printed text of an early
version of Shakespeare’s play? On balance, the evidence supports the
view that it was an old play which Shakespeare reworked in his own vein
(rather as he reworked other anonymously authored chronicle plays such
as The Famous Victories of Henry V and King Leir ). The third volume of
the 1587 edition of Holinshed’s Chronicles is the primary historical
source behind both the anonymous play and Shakespeare’s.</p>
<p>TEXT: The two parts of The Troublesome Reign were reprinted together
in 1611 with the title-page claim ‘Written by W. Sh.’ (reprinted 1622 as
‘Written by W. Shakespeare’), but this was a sales ploy and not a
reliable attribution. The only authoritative text is that in the First
Folio. Scholars dispute the nature of the copy from which it was
typeset; there is some evidence that it may have been the work of two
scribes. There are a number of textual problems, most notably in the
name of Hubert: this first appears halfway through Act 2 scene 1 as
speaker’s name for the citizen of Angiers (who is initially an anonymous
‘Cit.’ ), but it is not used in the dialogue at this point, so the
citizen is not identifiable by name to the audience. In the theatre,
‘Hubert’ is named for the first time when he swears loyalty to King John
and is commissioned to imprison Arthur. Is the same person intended?
Editors differ in their attempts to untangle this problem: we leave the
question open by means of a marginal direction.</p>
