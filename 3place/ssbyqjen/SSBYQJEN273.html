<h4 id="scene-3-running-scene-8">Scene 3 / running scene 8</h4>
<p>Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Approach 450 , Sir Andrew. Not to be abed after midnight is
to be up betimes 451 , and diluculo surgere 452 , thou know’st—</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Nay, by my troth I know not, but I know to be up late is
to be up late.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY A false conclusion. I hate it as an unfilled can 453 . To be
up after midnight and to go to bed then is early: so that to go to bed
after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our lives 454 consist
of the four elements 455 ?</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Faith, so they say, but I think it rather consists of
eating and drinking.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Thou’rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink. Marian
456 , I say, a stoup 457 of wine!</p>
<p>Enter Clown [Feste ]</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Here comes the fool, i’faith.</p>
<p>FESTE How now, my hearts 458 ! Did you never see the picture of ‘we
three 459’?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Welcome, ass. Now let’s have a catch 460 .</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW By my troth the fool has an excellent breast 461 . I had
rather than forty shillings I had such a leg 462 , and so sweet a breath
to sing, as the fool has. In sooth thou wast 463 in very gracious
fooling last night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians
passing the equinoctial 464 of Queubus 465 . ’Twas very good, i’faith. I
sent thee sixpence for thy leman 466 . Hadst it 467 ?</p>
<p>FESTE I did impeticos 468 thy gratillity 469 , for Malvolio’s nose is
no whipstock 470 . My lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons 471 are
no bottle-ale houses 472 .</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Excellent. Why, this is the best fooling, when all is
done. Now, a song.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Come on, there is sixpence for you. Let’s have a song.</p>
<p>Gives a coin to Feste</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW There’s a testril of 473 me too. If one knight give a—</p>
<p>Gives another coin</p>
<p>FESTE Would you have a love song, or a song of good life 474 ?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY A love song, a love song.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Ay, ay. I care not for good life.</p>
<p>FESTE O mistress mine, where are you roaming?</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>O stay and hear, your true love’s coming,</p>
<p>That can sing both high and low 475 .</p>
<p>Trip 476 no further, pretty sweeting 477 ,</p>
<p>Journeys end in lovers meeting,</p>
<p>Every wise man’s son doth know.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Excellent good, i’faith.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Good, good.</p>
<p>FESTE What is love? ’Tis not hereafter 478 ,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Present mirth hath present laughter.</p>
<p>What’s to come is still 479 unsure.</p>
<p>In delay there lies no plenty 480 ,</p>
<p>Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty 481 ,</p>
<p>Youth’s a stuff 482 will not endure.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW A mellifluous voice, as I am true 483 knight.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY A contagious breath 484 .</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Very sweet and contagious, i’faith.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY To hear by the nose 485 , it is dulcet in contagion 486 .
But shall we make the welkin 487 dance indeed? Shall we rouse 488 the
night owl in a catch that will draw three souls 489 out of one weaver
490 ? Shall we do that?</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW An you love me, let’s do’t. I am dog 491 at a catch.</p>
<p>FESTE By’r lady 492 , sir, and some dogs will catch well.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Most certain. Let our catch be, ‘Thou knave 493’.</p>
<p>FESTE ‘Hold thy peace 494 , thou knave’, knight? I shall be
constrained 495 in’t to call thee knave, knight.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW ‘Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call me
knave. Begin, fool: it begins ’Hold thy peace’.</p>
<p>FESTE I shall never begin if I hold my peace.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Good, i’faith. Come, begin.</p>
<p>Catch sung</p>
<p>Enter Maria</p>
<p>MARIA What a caterwauling do you keep 496 here? If my lady have not
called up her steward 497 Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors,
never trust me.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY My lady’s a Catayan 498 , we are politicians 499 ,
Malvolio’s a Peg-a-Ramsey 500 , and ‘Three merry men be we 501’. Am not
I consanguineous 502 ? Am I not of her blood?</p>
<p>Tillyvally 503 . Lady!</p>
<p>‘There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!’ 504</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>FESTE Beshrew 505 me, the knight’s in admirable fooling.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do I
too: he does it with a better grace 506 , but I do it more natural 507
.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY ‘O, the twelfth day of December’ 508 —</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>MARIA For the love o’God, peace!</p>
<p>Enter Malvolio</p>
<p>MALVOLIO My masters, are you mad? Or what are you? Have you no wit
509 , manners, nor honesty 510 , but to gabble like tinkers 511 at this
time of night? Do ye make an alehouse of my lady’s house, that ye squeak
out 512 your coziers’ 513 catches without any mitigation or remorse 514
of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time in you?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up! 515</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Sir Toby, I must be round 516 with you. My lady bade me tell
you that though she harbours 517 you as her kinsman, she’s nothing
allied 518 to your disorders. If you can separate yourself and your
misdemeanours, you are welcome to the house. If not, an it would please
you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY ‘Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.’ 519</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>MARIA Nay, good Sir Toby.</p>
<p>FESTE ‘His eyes do show his days are almost done.’</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Is’t even so 520 ?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY ‘But I will never die.’</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>FESTE Sir Toby, there you lie.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO This is much credit to you.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY ‘Shall I bid him go?’</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>FESTE ‘What an if 521 you do?’</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>SIR TOBY ‘Shall I bid him go, and spare not 522 ?’</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>FESTE ‘O no, no, no, no, you dare not.’</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Out o’tune 523 , sir, ye lie. Art 524 any more than a
steward? Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no
more cakes and ale 525 ?</p>
<p>FESTE Yes, by Saint Anne 526 , and ginger 527 shall be hot i’th’mouth
too.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Thou’rt i’th’right. Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs 528
. A stoup of wine, Maria!</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Mistress Mary, if you prized 529 my lady’s favour at
anything more than contempt 530 , you would not give means 531 for this
uncivil rule 532 ; she shall know of it, by this hand.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>MARIA Go shake your ears 533 .</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW ’Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man’s a-hungry
534 , to challenge him the field 535 , and then to break promise with
him and make a fool of him.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Do’t, knight. I’ll write thee a challenge, or I’ll deliver
thy indignation to him by word of mouth.</p>
<p>MARIA Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight. Since the youth of the
count’s was today with my lady, she is much out of quiet 536 . For 537
Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him 538 : if I do not gull 539 him
into a nayword 540 and make him a common recreation 541 , do not think I
have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I can do it.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Possess 542 us, possess us, tell us something of him.</p>
<p>MARIA Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan 543 .</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW O, if I thought that, I’d beat him like a dog!</p>
<p>SIR TOBY What, for being a puritan? Thy exquisite 544 reason, dear
knight?</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW I have no exquisite reason for’t, but I have reason good
enough.</p>
<p>MARIA The devil a puritan that he is, or anything constantly 545 ,
but a time-pleaser 546 , an affectioned 547 ass, that cons state without
book 548 and utters it by great swarths 549 . The best persuaded 550 of
himself, so crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies 551 , that it is
his grounds of faith 552 that all that look on him love him. And on that
vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY What wilt thou do?</p>
<p>MARIA I will drop in his way some obscure epistles 553 of love,
wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of
his gait, the expressure 554 of his eye, forehead, and complexion 555 ,
he shall find himself most feelingly personated 556 . I can write very
like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter 557 we can hardly make
distinction of 558 our hands 559 .</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Excellent! I smell a device 560 .</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW I have’t in my nose too.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that
they come from my niece and that she’s in love with him.</p>
<p>MARIA My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW And your horse now would make him an ass.</p>
<p>MARIA Ass 561 , I doubt not.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW O, ’twill be admirable!</p>
<p>MARIA Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic 562 will work with
him. I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall
find the letter. Observe his construction 563 of it. For this night, to
bed, and dream on the event 564 . Farewell.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Good night, Penthesilea 565 .</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Before me 566 , she’s a good wench.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY She’s a beagle 567 , true-bred, and one that adores me. What
o’that?</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW I was adored once too.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Let’s to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more
money.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW If I cannot recover 568 your niece, I am a foul way out
569 .</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Send for money, knight. If thou hast her not i’th’end, call
me cut 570 .</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Come, come, I’ll go burn 571 some sack 572 . ’Tis too late
to go to bed now. Come, knight, come, knight.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
