13</h4>
<p>Enter the Earl of Warwick and the Lord Chief Justice</p>
<p>WARWICK How now, my Lord Chief Justice whither away 1600 ?</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE How doth the king?</p>
<p>WARWICK Exceeding well, his cares are now all ended.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE I hope, not dead.</p>
<p>WARWICK He’s walked the way of nature,</p>
<p>And to our purposes he lives no more.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE I would his majesty had called me with him.</p>
<p>The service that I truly 1601 did his life</p>
<p>Hath left me open to all injuries 1602 .</p>
<p>WARWICK Indeed I think the young king loves you not.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE I know he doth not, and do arm myself</p>
<p>To welcome the condition of the time,</p>
<p>Which cannot look more hideously upon me</p>
<p>Than I have drawn it in my fantasy 1603 .</p>
<p>Enter John of Lancaster [Prince John ], Gloucester and Clarence,
[Westmorland and others ]</p>
<p>WARWICK Here come the heavy issue 1604 of dead Harry.</p>
<p>O, that the living Harry had the temper 1605</p>
<p>Of him, the worst of these three gentlemen!</p>
<p>How many nobles then should hold their places 1606</p>
<p>That must strike sail 1607 to spirits of vile 1608 sort!</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Alas, I fear all will be overturned.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE Good morrow, cousin.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN We meet like men that had forgot to speak.</p>
<p>WARWICK We do remember, but our argument 1609</p>
<p>Is all too heavy to admit much talk.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed,</p>
<p>And I dare swear you borrow not 1610 that face</p>
<p>Of seeming sorrow, it is sure 1611 your own.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN Though no man be assured what grace 1612 to find,</p>
<p>You stand in coldest expectation 1613 .</p>
<p>I am the sorrier, would ’twere otherwise.</p>
<p>CLARENCE Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair,</p>
<p>Which swims against your stream of quality 1614 .</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Sweet princes, what I did, I did in honour,</p>
<p>Led by th’impartial conduct of my soul,</p>
<p>And never shall you see that I will beg</p>
<p>A ragged 1615 and forestalled remission 1616 .</p>
<p>If troth 1617 and upright innocency fail me,</p>
<p>I’ll to the king my master that is dead,</p>
<p>And tell him who hath sent me after him.</p>
<p>WARWICK Here comes the prince.</p>
<p>Enter Prince Henry [now King Henry V ]</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Good morrow, and heaven save your majesty!</p>
<p>KING HENRY V This new and gorgeous garment majesty</p>
<p>Sits not so easy on me as you think.—</p>
<p>Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear.</p>
<p>This is the English, not the Turkish court,</p>
<p>Not Amurah 1618 an Amurah succeeds,</p>
<p>But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,</p>
<p>For, to speak truth, it very well becomes you.</p>
<p>Sorrow so royally in you appears</p>
<p>That I will deeply put the fashion on</p>
<p>And wear it in my heart. Why then, be sad,</p>
<p>But entertain no more of it, good brothers,</p>
<p>Than a joint burden laid upon us all.</p>
<p>For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,</p>
<p>I’ll be your father and your brother too.</p>
<p>Let me but bear your love, I’ll bear your cares;</p>
<p>But weep that Harry’s dead, and so will I;</p>
<p>But Harry lives, that shall convert those tears</p>
<p>By number into hours of happiness 1619 .</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN, GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE We hope no other from your
majesty.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V You all look strangely 1620 on me.— And you most:</p>
<p>To Lord Chief Justice</p>
<p>You are, I think, assured 1621 I love you not.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE I am assured, if I be measured rightly,</p>
<p>Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V No?</p>
<p>How might a prince of my great hopes 1622 forget</p>
<p>So great indignities you laid upon me?</p>
<p>What? Rate 1623 , rebuke, and roughly send to prison</p>
<p>Th’immediate heir of England? Was this easy 1624 ?</p>
<p>May this be washed in Lethe 1625 , and forgotten?</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE I then did use the person 1626 of your father,</p>
<p>The image of his power lay then in me,</p>
<p>And in th’administration of his law,</p>
<p>Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,</p>
<p>Your highness pleasèd to forget my place,</p>
<p>The majesty and power of law and justice,</p>
<p>The image of the king whom I presented 1627 ,</p>
<p>And struck me in my very seat of judgement,</p>
<p>Whereon, as an offender to your father,</p>
<p>I gave bold way to my authority</p>
<p>And did commit 1628 you. If the deed were ill,</p>
<p>Be you 1629 contented, wearing now the garland 1630 ,</p>
<p>To have a son set your decrees at nought?</p>
<p>To pluck down justice from your awful 1631 bench 1632 ?</p>
<p>To trip the course of law and blunt the sword</p>
<p>That guards the peace and safety of your person?</p>
<p>Nay, more, to spurn 1633 at your most royal image</p>
<p>And mock your workings in a second body 1634 ?</p>
<p>Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours 1635 ,</p>
<p>Be now the father and propose 1636 a son,</p>
<p>Hear your own dignity so much profaned 1637 ,</p>
<p>See your most dreadful 1638 laws so loosely 1639 slighted,</p>
<p>Behold yourself so by a son disdained,</p>
<p>And then imagine me taking your part</p>
<p>And in your power soft 1640 silencing your son.</p>
<p>After this cold considerance 1641 , sentence me;</p>
<p>And, as you are a king, speak in your state 1642</p>
<p>What I have done that misbecame 1643 my place,</p>
<p>My person, or my liege’s sovereignty.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V You are right, Justice, and you weigh 1644 this
well:</p>
<p>Therefore still bear the balance and the sword 1645 .</p>
<p>And I do wish your honours may increase</p>
<p>Till you do live to see a son of mine</p>
<p>Offend you and obey you, as I did.</p>
<p>So shall I live to speak my father’s words:</p>
<p>’Happy am I, that have a man so bold,</p>
<p>That dares do justice on my proper 1646 son;</p>
<p>And no less happy, having such a son,</p>
<p>That would deliver up his greatness so</p>
<p>Into the hands of justice.’ You did commit 1647 me,</p>
<p>For which, I do commit into your hand</p>
<p>Th’unstained sword that you have used 1648 to bear,</p>
<p>With this remembrance 1649 : that you use the same</p>
<p>With the like bold, just and impartial spirit</p>
<p>As you have done gainst me. There is my hand.</p>
<p>Offers his hand</p>
<p>You shall be as a father to my youth,</p>
<p>My voice shall sound 1650 as you do prompt mine ear,</p>
<p>And I will stoop and humble my intents 1651</p>
<p>To your well-practised 1652 wise directions.</p>
<p>And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you:</p>
<p>My father is gone wild into his grave,</p>
<p>For in his tomb lie my affections 1653 ,</p>
<p>And with his spirits sadly 1654 I survive,</p>
<p>To mock 1655 the expectation of the world,</p>
<p>To frustrate prophecies and to raze out 1656</p>
<p>Rotten opinion 1657 , who hath writ me down</p>
<p>After my seeming 1658 . The tide of blood in me</p>
<p>Hath proudly flowed in vanity 1659 till now.</p>
<p>Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,</p>
<p>Where it shall mingle with the state of floods 1660</p>
<p>And flow henceforth in formal majesty.</p>
<p>Now call we our high court of parliament,</p>
<p>And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel 1661 ,</p>
<p>That the great body of our state may go</p>
<p>In equal rank with the best governed nation,</p>
<p>That war, or peace, or both at once, may be</p>
<p>As things acquainted and familiar to us,—</p>
<p>In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.</p>
<p>To Lord Chief Justice</p>
<p>Our coronation done, we will accite 1662 ,</p>
<p>As I before remembered 1663 , all our state.</p>
<p>And, heaven consigning to 1664 my good intents,</p>
<p>No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,</p>
<p>Heaven shorten Harry’s happy life one day!</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
