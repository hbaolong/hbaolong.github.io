<h4 id="scene-2-680-running-scene-7">Scene 2 680 / running scene 7</h4>
<p>Enter King Edward, [Richard, now Duke of ] Gloucester, [George, now
Duke of ] Clarence, Lady Grey</p>
<p>Richard is henceforth known as Gloucester, George as Clarence</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Brother of Gloucester, at St Alban’s field 681</p>
<p>This lady’s husband, Sir Richard 682 Grey, was slain,</p>
<p>His land then seized on by the conqueror.</p>
<p>Her suit 683 is now to repossess 684 those lands,</p>
<p>Which we in justice cannot well deny,</p>
<p>Because in quarrel of 685 the House of York</p>
<p>The worthy gentleman did lose his life.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Your highness shall do well to grant her suit:</p>
<p>It were dishonour to deny it her.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV It were no less, but yet I’ll make a pause.</p>
<p>Gloucester and Clarence speak aside throughout</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Yea, is it so?</p>
<p>I see the lady hath a thing 686 to grant,</p>
<p>Before the king will grant her humble suit.</p>
<p>CLARENCE He knows the game 687 . How true he keeps the wind 688 !</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Silence!</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Widow, we will consider of your suit,</p>
<p>And come some other time to know our mind.</p>
<p>LADY GREY Right gracious lord, I cannot brook 689 delay.</p>
<p>May it please your highness to resolve 690 me now,</p>
<p>And what your pleasure 691 is, shall satisfy 692 me.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Ay, widow? Then I’ll warrant 693 you all your lands,</p>
<p>An if 694 what pleases him shall pleasure you.</p>
<p>Fight closer 695 , or good faith, you’ll catch a blow 696 .</p>
<p>CLARENCE I fear her not 697 , unless she chance to fall 698 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER God forbid that, for he’ll take vantages 699 .</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV How many children hast thou, widow? Tell me.</p>
<p>CLARENCE I think he means to beg a child of her 700 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Nay, then, whip me 701 : he’ll rather give her two.</p>
<p>LADY GREY Three, my most gracious lord.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER You shall have four, if you’ll be ruled by him.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV ’Twere pity they should lose their father’s lands.</p>
<p>LADY GREY Be pitiful, dread 702 lord, and grant it then.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Lords, give us leave 703 : I’ll try 704 this widow’s
wit 705 .</p>
<p>Gloucester and Clarence step back</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Ay, good leave have you, for you will have leave 706 ,</p>
<p>and continue to speak aside</p>
<p>Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch 707 .</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?</p>
<p>LADY GREY Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV And would you not do much to do them good?</p>
<p>LADY GREY To do them good, I would sustain some harm.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Then get your husband’s lands, to do them good.</p>
<p>LADY GREY Therefore 708 I came unto your majesty.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV I’ll tell you how these lands are to be got.</p>
<p>LADY GREY So shall you bind me to your highness’ service 709 .</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?</p>
<p>LADY GREY What you command, that rests in me 710 to do.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV But you will take exceptions to my boon 711 .</p>
<p>LADY GREY No, gracious lord, except 712 I cannot do it.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Ay, but thou canst do 713 what I mean to ask.</p>
<p>LADY GREY Why, then I will do what your grace commands.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER He plies her hard 714 , and much rain wears the
marble.</p>
<p>CLARENCE As red 715 as fire! Nay, then her wax must melt.</p>
<p>LADY GREY Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV An easy task 716 , ’tis but to love a king.</p>
<p>LADY GREY That’s soon performed, because I am a subject.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Why, then, thy husband’s lands I freely give thee.</p>
<p>LADY GREY I take my leave with many thousand thanks.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER The match 717 is made: she seals it with a curtsy.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV But stay thee, ’tis the fruits of love 718 I mean.</p>
<p>LADY GREY The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.</p>
<p>What love, think’st thou, I sue 719 so much to get?</p>
<p>LADY GREY My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers,</p>
<p>That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV No, by my troth 720 , I did not mean such love.</p>
<p>LADY GREY Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV But now you partly may perceive my mind.</p>
<p>LADY GREY My mind will never grant what I perceive</p>
<p>Your highness aims at, if I aim aright 721 .</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with 722 thee.</p>
<p>LADY GREY To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband’s lands.</p>
<p>LADY GREY Why, then mine honesty 723 shall be my dower 724 ,</p>
<p>For by that loss 725 I will not purchase them.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Therein thou wrong’st thy children mightily.</p>
<p>LADY GREY Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.</p>
<p>But, mighty lord, this merry inclination 726</p>
<p>Accords not with the sadness 727 of my suit.</p>
<p>Please you dismiss me either with ‘Ay’ or ‘No’.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Ay, if thou wilt say ‘Ay’ to my request;</p>
<p>No if thou dost say ‘No’ to my demand.</p>
<p>LADY GREY Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER The widow likes him not, she knits her brows 728 .</p>
<p>CLARENCE He is the bluntest 729 wooer in Christendom.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Her looks do argue her 730 replete with modesty,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Her words doth show her wit incomparable,</p>
<p>All her perfections challenge 731 sovereignty.</p>
<p>One way or other, she is for a king,</p>
<p>And she shall be my love 732 , or else my queen.—</p>
<p>Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?</p>
<p>To her</p>
<p>LADY GREY ’Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:</p>
<p>I am a subject fit to jest withal,</p>
<p>But far unfit to be a sovereign.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Sweet widow, by my state 733 I swear to thee,</p>
<p>I speak no more than what my soul intends,</p>
<p>And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.</p>
<p>LADY GREY And that is more than I will yield unto:</p>
<p>I know I am too mean 734 to be your queen</p>
<p>And yet too good to be your concubine.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV You cavil 735 , widow: I did mean, my queen.</p>
<p>LADY GREY ’Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you
father.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV No more than when my daughters call thee mother.</p>
<p>Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children,</p>
<p>And, by God’s mother, I, being but a bachelor,</p>
<p>Have other some 736 . Why, ’tis a happy thing</p>
<p>To be the father unto many sons.</p>
<p>Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER The ghostly 737 father 738 now hath done his shrift 739
.</p>
<p>CLARENCE When he was made a shriver 740 , ’twas for shift 741 .</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Brothers, you muse 742 what chat we two have had.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.</p>
<p>To Edward</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV You’ll think it strange if I should marry her.</p>
<p>CLARENCE To who, my lord?</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Why, Clarence, to myself.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER That would be ten days’ wonder at the least.</p>
<p>CLARENCE That’s a day longer than a wonder lasts 743 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER By so much is the wonder in extremes 744 .</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Well, jest on, brothers. I can tell you both</p>
<p>Her suit is granted for her husband’s lands.</p>
<p>Enter a Nobleman</p>
<p>NOBLEMAN My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken 745 ,</p>
<p>And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV See that he be conveyed unto the Tower,</p>
<p>And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,</p>
<p>To question of his apprehension 746 .—</p>
<p>Widow, go you along.— Lords, use 747 her honourably.</p>
<p>Exeunt. Richard [of Gloucester ] remains</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Ay, Edward will use women honourably.</p>
<p>Would he were wasted 748 , marrow 749 , bones and all,</p>
<p>That from his loins no hopeful branch 750 may spring,</p>
<p>To cross 751 me from the golden time 752 I look for.</p>
<p>And yet, between my soul’s desire and me —</p>
<p>The lustful Edward’s title burièd 753 —</p>
<p>Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,</p>
<p>And all the unlooked for 754 issue 755 of their bodies,</p>
<p>To take their rooms 756 , ere I can place myself.</p>
<p>A cold premeditation 757 for my purpose.</p>
<p>Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty,</p>
<p>Like one that stands upon a promontory 758 ,</p>
<p>And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,</p>
<p>Wishing his foot were equal with 759 his eye,</p>
<p>And chides 760 the sea that sunders 761 him from thence,</p>
<p>Saying, he’ll lade 762 it dry to have his way:</p>
<p>So do I wish 763 the crown, being so far off,</p>
<p>And so I chide the means 764 that keeps me from it,</p>
<p>And so I say, I’ll cut the causes off 765 ,</p>
<p>Flattering me 766 with impossibilities.</p>
<p>My eye’s too quick, my heart o’erweens 767 too much,</p>
<p>Unless my hand and strength could equal them.</p>
<p>Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard:</p>
<p>What other pleasure can the world afford?</p>
<p>I’ll make my heaven in a lady’s lap,</p>
<p>And deck 768 my body in gay ornaments 769 ,</p>
<p>And witch 770 sweet ladies with my words and looks.</p>
<p>O, miserable thought, and more unlikely</p>
<p>Than to accomplish 771 twenty golden crowns.</p>
<p>Why, love forswore 772 me in my mother’s womb,</p>
<p>And, for 773 I should not deal in 774 her soft laws,</p>
<p>She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,</p>
<p>To shrink mine arm up like a withered shrub,</p>
<p>To make an envious 775 mountain on my back,</p>
<p>Where sits deformity to mock my body;</p>
<p>To shape my legs of an unequal size,</p>
<p>To disproportion me in every part,</p>
<p>Like to a chaos 776 or an unlicked bear-whelp 777 ,</p>
<p>That carries no impression like the dam 778 .</p>
<p>And am I then a man to be beloved?</p>
<p>O, monstrous 779 fault 780 , to harbour such a thought.</p>
<p>Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,</p>
<p>But to command, to check 781 , to o’erbear 782 such</p>
<p>As are of better person 783 than myself,</p>
<p>I’ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,</p>
<p>And whiles I live, t’account 784 this world but hell,</p>
<p>Until my misshaped trunk 785 that bears this head</p>
<p>Be round impalèd 786 with a glorious crown.</p>
<p>And yet I know not how to get the crown,</p>
<p>For many lives stand between me and home 787 ,</p>
<p>And I — like one lost in a thorny wood,</p>
<p>That rents 788 the thorns and is rent with the thorns,</p>
<p>Seeking a way and straying from the way,</p>
<p>Not knowing how to find the open air,</p>
<p>But toiling desperately to find it out —</p>
<p>Torment myself to catch 789 the English crown:</p>
<p>And from that torment I will free myself,</p>
<p>Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.</p>
<p>Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,</p>
<p>And cry ‘Content’ to that which grieves my heart,</p>
<p>And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,</p>
<p>And frame 790 my face to all occasions.</p>
<p>I’ll drown more sailors than the mermaid 791 shall,</p>
<p>I’ll slay more gazers than the basilisk 792 ,</p>
<p>I’ll play the orator as well as Nestor 793 ,</p>
<p>Deceive more slyly than Ulysses 794 could,</p>
<p>And, like a Sinon 795 , take another Troy.</p>
<p>I can add colours to the chameleon,</p>
<p>Change shapes with Proteus 796 for advantages,</p>
<p>And set the murderous Machevil 797 to school 798 .</p>
<p>Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?</p>
<p>Tut, were it further off, I’ll pluck it down.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
