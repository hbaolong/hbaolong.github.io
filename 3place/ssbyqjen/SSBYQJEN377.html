<h4 id="scene-3-308-running-scene-3">Scene 3 308 / running scene 3</h4>
<p>Enter Aaron alone</p>
<p>With a bag of gold</p>
<p>AARON He that had wit would think that I had none,</p>
<p>To bury so much gold under a tree</p>
<p>And never after to inherit 309 it.</p>
<p>Let him that thinks of me so abjectly</p>
<p>Know that this gold must coin 310 a stratagem</p>
<p>Which, cunningly effected, will beget 311</p>
<p>A very excellent piece of villainy:</p>
<p>And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest</p>
<p>Hides the gold</p>
<p>That have their alms out of the empress’ chest 312 .</p>
<p>Enter Tamora to the Moor</p>
<p>TAMORA My lovely Aaron, wherefore 313 look’st thou sad</p>
<p>When everything doth make a gleeful boast 314 ?</p>
<p>The birds chant melody on every bush,</p>
<p>The snake lies rollèd in the cheerful sun,</p>
<p>The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind</p>
<p>And make a chequered shadow on the ground:</p>
<p>Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,</p>
<p>And whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,</p>
<p>Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns</p>
<p>As if a double hunt were heard at once,</p>
<p>Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise,</p>
<p>And after conflict 315 such as was supposed</p>
<p>The wand’ring prince and Dido 316 once enjoyed,</p>
<p>When with a happy 317 storm they were surprised</p>
<p>And curtained with a counsel-keeping 318 cave,</p>
<p>We may, each wreathèd in the other’s arms,</p>
<p>Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber,</p>
<p>Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds</p>
<p>Be unto us as is a nurse’s song</p>
<p>Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.</p>
<p>AARON Madam, though Venus 319 govern your desires,</p>
<p>Saturn 320 is dominator 321 over mine:</p>
<p>What signifies my deadly-standing 322 eye,</p>
<p>My silence and my cloudy melancholy,</p>
<p>My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls</p>
<p>Even as an adder when she doth unroll</p>
<p>To do some fatal execution?</p>
<p>No, madam, these are no venereal 323 signs:</p>
<p>Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,</p>
<p>Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.</p>
<p>Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,</p>
<p>Which never hopes 324 more heaven than rests in thee,</p>
<p>This is the day of doom for Bassianus:</p>
<p>His Philomel 325 must lose her tongue today,</p>
<p>Thy sons make pillage of her chastity</p>
<p>And wash their hands in Bassianus’ blood.</p>
<p>See’st thou this letter? Take it up 326 , I pray thee,</p>
<p>And give the king this fatal-plotted scroll.</p>
<p>Now question me no more: we are espied.</p>
<p>Here comes a parcel 327 of our hopeful 328 booty,</p>
<p>Which dreads not yet their lives’ destruction.</p>
<p>Enter Bassianus and Lavinia</p>
<p>At a distance</p>
<p>TAMORA Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!</p>
<p>AARON No more, great empress: Bassianus comes.</p>
<p>Be cross 329 with him, and I’ll go fetch thy sons</p>
<p>To back thy quarrels, whatsoe’er they be.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>BASSIANUS Whom have we here? Rome’s royal emperess,</p>
<p>Unfurnished of her well-beseeming troop 330 ?</p>
<p>Or is it Dian 331 , habited 332 like her,</p>
<p>Who hath abandonèd her holy groves</p>
<p>To see the general 333 hunting in this forest?</p>
<p>TAMORA Saucy 334 controller 335 of our private steps,</p>
<p>Had I the power that some say Dian had,</p>
<p>Thy temples should be planted presently 336</p>
<p>With horns, as was Actaeon 337 ’s, and the hounds</p>
<p>Should drive 338 upon thy new-transformèd limbs,</p>
<p>Unmannerly intruder as thou art.</p>
<p>LAVINIA Under your patience 339 , gentle 340 emperess,</p>
<p>’Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning 341 ,</p>
<p>And to be doubted 342 that your Moor and you</p>
<p>Are singled forth 343 to try experiments 344 :</p>
<p>Jove 345 shield your husband from his hounds today —</p>
<p>’Tis pity they should take him for a stag.</p>
<p>BASSIANUS Believe me, queen, your swarth 346 Cimmerian 347</p>
<p>Doth make your honour of his body’s hue,</p>
<p>Spotted, detested and abominable.</p>
<p>Why are you sequestered 348 from all your train 349 ,</p>
<p>Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed,</p>
<p>And wandered hither to an obscure plot,</p>
<p>Accompanied with a barbarous Moor,</p>
<p>If foul desire had not conducted you?</p>
<p>LAVINIA And being intercepted in your sport,</p>
<p>Great reason 350 that my noble lord be rated 351</p>
<p>For sauciness.— I pray you let us hence,</p>
<p>To Bassianus</p>
<p>And let her joy 352 her raven-coloured love:</p>
<p>This valley fits the purpose passing 353 well.</p>
<p>BASSIANUS The king my brother shall have note of this.</p>
<p>LAVINIA Ay, for these slips 354 have made him noted 355 long:</p>
<p>Good king, to be so mightily abused.</p>
<p>TAMORA Why, I have patience to endure all this.</p>
<p>Enter Chiron and Demetrius</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS How now, dear sovereign and our gracious mother,</p>
<p>Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?</p>
<p>TAMORA Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?</p>
<p>These two have ’ticed 356 me hither to this place:</p>
<p>A barren detested vale you see it is.</p>
<p>The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,</p>
<p>O’ercome 357 with moss and baleful 358 mistletoe:</p>
<p>Here never shines the sun, here nothing breeds</p>
<p>Unless the nightly owl or fatal 359 raven 360 .</p>
<p>And when they showed me this abhorrèd pit,</p>
<p>They told me here at dead time of the night,</p>
<p>A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,</p>
<p>Ten thousand swelling toads 361 , as many urchins 362 ,</p>
<p>Would make such fearful and confusèd cries</p>
<p>As any mortal body hearing it</p>
<p>Should straight 363 fall mad, or else die suddenly 364 .</p>
<p>No sooner had they told this hellish tale,</p>
<p>But straight they told me they would bind me here</p>
<p>Unto the body of a dismal 365 yew</p>
<p>And leave me to this miserable death.</p>
<p>And then they called me foul adulteress,</p>
<p>Lascivious Goth 366 , and all the bitterest terms</p>
<p>That ever ear did hear to such effect:</p>
<p>And had you not by wondrous fortune come,</p>
<p>This vengeance on me had they executed.</p>
<p>Revenge it as you love your mother’s life,</p>
<p>Or be ye not henceforth called my children.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS This is a witness that I am thy son.</p>
<p>Stab him</p>
<p>CHIRON And this for me, struck home to show my strength.</p>
<p>He also stabs Bassianus</p>
<p>LAVINIA Ay, come, Semiramis 367 , nay, barbarous Tamora,</p>
<p>For no name fits thy nature but thy own.</p>
<p>TAMORA Give me thy poniard 368 : you shall know, my boys</p>
<p>Your mother’s hand shall right your mother’s wrong.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Stay, madam, here is more belongs to her:</p>
<p>First thrash 369 the corn, then after burn the straw.</p>
<p>This minion 370 stood upon 371 her chastity,</p>
<p>Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,</p>
<p>And with that painted 372 hope braves your mightiness.</p>
<p>And shall she carry this unto her grave?</p>
<p>CHIRON An if 373 she do, I would I were an eunuch.</p>
<p>Drag hence her husband to some secret hole</p>
<p>And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.</p>
<p>TAMORA But when ye have the honey 374 we desire,</p>
<p>Let not this wasp outlive 375 , us both to sting.</p>
<p>CHIRON I warrant 376 you, madam, we will make that sure.—</p>
<p>Come, mistress, now perforce 377 we will enjoy</p>
<p>That nice-preservèd honesty 378 of yours.</p>
<p>LAVINIA O Tamora, thou bear’st a woman’s face—</p>
<p>TAMORA I will not hear her speak, away with her!</p>
<p>LAVINIA Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory</p>
<p>To Tamora</p>
<p>To see her tears, but be your heart to them</p>
<p>As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.</p>
<p>LAVINIA When did the tiger’s young ones teach the dam 379 ?</p>
<p>O, do not learn 380 her wrath: she taught it thee.</p>
<p>The milk thou suck’st from her did turn to marble:</p>
<p>Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny 381 .</p>
<p>Yet every mother breeds not sons alike 382 :—</p>
<p>Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.</p>
<p>To Chiron</p>
<p>CHIRON What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?</p>
<p>LAVINIA ’Tis true, the raven 383 doth not hatch a lark 384 .</p>
<p>Yet have I heard — O, could I find it 385 now! —</p>
<p>The lion moved with pity did endure</p>
<p>To have his princely paws 386 pared all away.</p>
<p>Some say that ravens foster forlorn 387 children</p>
<p>The whilst their own birds 388 famish in their nests:</p>
<p>O, be to me though thy hard heart say no,</p>
<p>Nothing so kind, but something pitiful 389 !</p>
<p>TAMORA I know not what it 390 means.— Away with her!</p>
<p>LAVINIA O, let me teach thee for my father’s sake,</p>
<p>That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee.</p>
<p>Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.</p>
<p>TAMORA Hadst thou in person ne’er offended me,</p>
<p>Even for his sake am I pitiless.</p>
<p>Remember, boys, I poured forth tears in vain</p>
<p>To save your brother from the sacrifice,</p>
<p>But fierce Andronicus would not relent.</p>
<p>Therefore away with her and use 391 her as you will:</p>
<p>The worse to her, the better loved of me.</p>
<p>LAVINIA O Tamora, be called a gentle queen,</p>
<p>Clings to Tamora</p>
<p>And with thine own hands kill me in this place,</p>
<p>For ’tis not life that I have begged so long:</p>
<p>Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.</p>
<p>TAMORA What begg’st thou, then? Fond 392 woman, let me go.</p>
<p>LAVINIA ’Tis present 393 death I beg, and one thing more</p>
<p>That womanhood 394 denies 395 my tongue to tell:</p>
<p>O, keep me from their worse-than-killing lust,</p>
<p>And tumble 396 me into some loathsome pit</p>
<p>Where never man’s eye may behold my body.</p>
<p>Do this, and be a charitable murderer.</p>
<p>TAMORA So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee 397 .</p>
<p>No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Away, for thou hast stayed 398 us here too long.</p>
<p>To Lavinia</p>
<p>LAVINIA No grace? No womanhood? Ah, beastly creature,</p>
<p>The blot and enemy to our general name 399 ,</p>
<p>Confusion 400 fall—</p>
<p>CHIRON Nay, then I’ll stop your mouth.—</p>
<p>Grabs her</p>
<p>Bring thou her husband:</p>
<p>To Demetrius</p>
<p>This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.</p>
<p>[Demetrius throws Bassianus’ body into the pit, he and Chiron then
exeunt, dragging off Lavinia ]</p>
<p>TAMORA Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure 401 .</p>
<p>Ne’er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,</p>
<p>Till all the Andronici 402 be made away 403 .</p>
<p>Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,</p>
<p>And let my spleenful 404 sons this trull 405 deflower.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Aaron with two of Titus’ sons [Quintus and Martius ]</p>
<p>AARON Come on, my lords, the better foot before 406 :</p>
<p>Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit</p>
<p>Where I espied the panther fast asleep.</p>
<p>QUINTUS My sight is very dull 407 , whate’er it bodes.</p>
<p>MARTIUS And mine, I promise you. Were it not for shame,</p>
<p>Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.</p>
<p>Falls into the pit</p>
<p>QUINTUS What art thou fallen? What subtle 408 hole is this,</p>
<p>Whose mouth is covered with rude-growing 409 briers</p>
<p>Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood</p>
<p>As fresh as morning’s dew distilled on flowers?</p>
<p>A very fatal place it seems to me.</p>
<p>Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?</p>
<p>MARTIUS O brother, with the dismall’st object 410 hurt</p>
<p>Martius speaks from below</p>
<p>That ever eye with sight made heart lament!</p>
<p>AARON Now will I fetch the king to find them here,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>That he thereby may have a likely guess</p>
<p>How these were they that made away his brother.</p>
<p>Exit Aaron</p>
<p>MARTIUS Why dost not comfort me and help me out</p>
<p>From this unhallowed 411 and blood-stainèd hole?</p>
<p>QUINTUS I am surprisèd 412 with an uncouth 413 fear,</p>
<p>A chilling sweat o’er-runs my trembling joints:</p>
<p>My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.</p>
<p>MARTIUS To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,</p>
<p>Aaron and thou look down into this den,</p>
<p>And see a fearful sight of blood and death.</p>
<p>QUINTUS Aaron is gone and my compassionate 414 heart</p>
<p>Will not permit mine eyes once to behold</p>
<p>The thing whereat it trembles by surmise 415 .</p>
<p>O, tell me how it is, for ne’er till now</p>
<p>Was I a child to fear I know not what.</p>
<p>MARTIUS Lord Bassianus lies embrewèd 416 here</p>
<p>All on a heap 417 , like to the slaughtered lamb,</p>
<p>In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.</p>
<p>QUINTUS If it be dark, how dost thou know ’tis he?</p>
<p>MARTIUS Upon his bloody finger he doth wear</p>
<p>A precious ring, that lightens all the hole 418 ,</p>
<p>Which like a taper in some monument 419</p>
<p>Doth shine upon the dead man’s earthly 420 cheeks</p>
<p>And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:</p>
<p>So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus 421</p>
<p>When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood 422 .</p>
<p>O brother, help me with thy fainting hand —</p>
<p>If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath —</p>
<p>Out of this fell 423 devouring receptacle,</p>
<p>As hateful as Cocytus 424 ’ misty mouth.</p>
<p>QUINTUS Reach me thy hand that I may help thee out</p>
<p>Reaches into the pit</p>
<p>Or, wanting 425 strength to do thee so much good,</p>
<p>I may be plucked into the swallowing womb 426</p>
<p>Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus’ grave.</p>
<p>I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.</p>
<p>MARTIUS Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.</p>
<p>QUINTUS Thy hand once more: I will not loose again</p>
<p>Till thou art here aloft or I below.</p>
<p>Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.</p>
<p>Both fall in</p>
<p>Enter the Emperor, Aaron the Moor [and Attendants ]</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Along with me: I’ll see what hole is here,</p>
<p>And what he is that now is leapt into it.—</p>
<p>Say who art thou that lately didst descend</p>
<p>Speaks into the pit</p>
<p>Into this gaping hollow of the earth?</p>
<p>MARTIUS The unhappy son of old Andronicus,</p>
<p>Brought hither in a most unlucky hour</p>
<p>To find thy brother Bassianus dead.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS My brother dead? I know thou dost but jest:</p>
<p>He and his lady both are at the lodge</p>
<p>Upon the north side of this pleasant chase.</p>
<p>’Tis not an hour since I left him there.</p>
<p>MARTIUS We know not where you left him all alive,</p>
<p>But, out alas 427 , here have we found him dead.</p>
<p>Enter Tamora [with Attendants, ] Andronicus and Lucius</p>
<p>TAMORA Where is my lord the king?</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Here, Tamora, though gride 428 with killing grief.</p>
<p>TAMORA Where is thy brother Bassianus?</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Now to the bottom dost thou search 429 my wound:</p>
<p>Poor Bassianus here lies murderèd.</p>
<p>TAMORA Then all too late I bring this fatal writ 430 ,</p>
<p>The complot 431 of this timeless 432 tragedy,</p>
<p>And wonder greatly that man’s face can fold 433</p>
<p>In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.</p>
<p>She giveth Saturnine a letter</p>
<p>SATURNINUS ’An if we miss to meet him handsomely 434</p>
<p>Saturninus reads the letter</p>
<p>Sweet huntsman — Bassianus ’tis we mean —</p>
<p>Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:</p>
<p>Thou know’st our meaning. Look for thy reward</p>
<p>Among the nettles at the elder tree 435</p>
<p>Which overshades the mouth of that same pit</p>
<p>Where we decreed 436 to bury Bassianus.</p>
<p>Do this, and purchase 437 us thy lasting friends.’</p>
<p>O Tamora, was ever heard the like?</p>
<p>This is the pit and this the elder tree.—</p>
<p>Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out</p>
<p>That should 438 have murdered Bassianus here.</p>
<p>AARON My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.</p>
<p>Finds the bag</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody kind 439 ,</p>
<p>To Titus</p>
<p>Have here bereft my brother of his life.—</p>
<p>Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison:</p>
<p>There let them bide until we have devised</p>
<p>Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.</p>
<p>TAMORA What, are they in this pit? O wondrous 440 thing!</p>
<p>↓ Attendants may pull Quintus and Martius from the pit ↓</p>
<p>How easily murder is discoverèd.</p>
<p>TITUS High emperor, upon my feeble knee</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed,</p>
<p>That this fell fault of my accursèd sons,</p>
<p>Accursèd if the faults be proved in them—</p>
<p>SATURNINUS If it be proved? You see it is apparent 441 .</p>
<p>Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?</p>
<p>TAMORA Andronicus himself did take it up.</p>
<p>TITUS I did, my lord. Yet let me be their bail,</p>
<p>For by my father’s reverend tomb I vow</p>
<p>They shall be ready at your highness’ will</p>
<p>To answer their suspicion 442 with their lives.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.—</p>
<p>↓ Titus rises ↓</p>
<p>Some bring the murdered body, some the murderers:</p>
<p>Let them not speak a word: the guilt is plain,</p>
<p>For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,</p>
<p>That end upon them should be executed.</p>
<p>TAMORA Andronicus, I will entreat the king:</p>
<p>Fear not 443 thy sons, they shall do well enough.</p>
<p>TITUS Come, Lucius, come. Stay not to talk with them.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
