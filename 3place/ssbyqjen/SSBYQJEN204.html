<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-9-579">Scene 2 ／ running scene 9 579</h4>
<p>Enter Orlando</p>
<p>With a paper</p>
<p>ORLANDO Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:</p>
<p>And thou, thrice-crownèd queen of night 580 , survey</p>
<p>With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,</p>
<p>Thy huntress 581 ’ name that my full life doth sway 582 .</p>
<p>O Rosalind! These trees shall be my books,</p>
<p>And in their barks my thoughts I’ll character 583 ,</p>
<p>That every eye which in this forest looks</p>
<p>Shall see thy virtue witnessed everywhere.</p>
<p>Run, run, Orlando, carve on every tree</p>
<p>The fair, the chaste and unexpressive 584 she.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Corin and Clown [Touchstone ]</p>
<p>CORIN And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life;
but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught. In respect
that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is
private 585 , it is a very vile life. Now in respect it is in the
fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it
is tedious. As it is a spare 586 life, look you, it fits my humour 587
well; but as there is no more plenty 588 in it, it goes much against my
stomach 589 . Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</p>
<p>CORIN No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at ease
he is: and that he that wants 590 money, means and content is without
three good friends: that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
burn: that good pasture makes fat sheep: and that a great cause of the
night is lack of the sun: that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor
art 591 may complain of 592 good breeding or comes of a very dull
kindred.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Such a one is a natural 593 philosopher. Wast ever in
court, shepherd?</p>
<p>CORIN No, truly.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Then thou art damned.</p>
<p>CORIN Nay, I hope 594 .</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Truly thou art damned, like an ill-roasted egg: all on one
side 595 .</p>
<p>CORIN For not being at court? Your reason.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good
manners 596 . If thou never saw’st good manners, then thy manners must
be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a
parlous 597 state, shepherd.</p>
<p>CORIN Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the
court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country
is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at the court,
but you kiss 598 your hands; that courtesy would be uncleanly, if
courtiers were shepherds.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Instance 599 , briefly. Come, instance.</p>
<p>CORIN Why, we are still 600 handling our ewes, and their fells 601 ,
you know are greasy.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat? And is not the
grease 602 of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow,
shallow. A better instance, I say, come.</p>
<p>CORIN Besides, our hands are hard.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more
sounder instance, come.</p>
<p>CORIN And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep
603 , and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier’s hands are perfumed
with civet 604 .</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Most shallow man! Thou worms-meat 605 in respect of 606 a
good piece of flesh indeed. Learn of the wise, and perpend 607 : civet
is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux 608 of a cat. Mend
609 the instance, shepherd.</p>
<p>CORIN You have too courtly a wit for me. I’ll rest 610 .</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man. God
make incision 611 in thee. Thou art raw 612 .</p>
<p>CORIN Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that 613 I eat, get 614 that
I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man’s happiness, glad of other men’s
good, content with my harm 615 , and the greatest of my pride is to see
my ewes graze and my lambs suck.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE That is another simple 616 sin in you: to bring the ewes
and the rams together and to offer 617 to get your living by the
copulation of cattle 618 , to be bawd 619 to a bell-wether 620 , and to
betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated 621 , old,
cuckoldly 622 ram, out of 623 all reasonable match. If thou be’st not
damned for this, the devil himself will have no shepherds. I cannot see
else how thou shouldst scape.</p>
<p>CORIN Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress’ brother.</p>
<p>Enter Rosalind</p>
<p>With a paper</p>
<p>ROSALIND ’From the east to western Ind 624 ,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>No jewel is like Rosalind.</p>
<p>Her worth, being mounted on the wind,</p>
<p>Through all the world bears Rosalind.</p>
<p>All the pictures fairest lined 625</p>
<p>Are but black to 626 Rosalind.</p>
<p>Let no face be kept in mind</p>
<p>But the fair 627 of Rosalind.’</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE I’ll rhyme you so eight years together 628 , dinners and
suppers and sleeping-hours excepted. It is the right butter-women’s rank
to market 629 .</p>
<p>ROSALIND Out, fool!</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE For a taste:</p>
<p>If a hart 630 do lack a hind 631 ,</p>
<p>Let him seek out Rosalind.</p>
<p>If the cat will after kind 632 ,</p>
<p>So be sure will Rosalind.</p>
<p>Wintered 633 garments must be lined 634 ,</p>
<p>So must slender Rosalind.</p>
<p>They that reap 635 must sheaf and bind 636 ,</p>
<p>Then to cart 637 with Rosalind.</p>
<p>Sweetest nut 638 hath sourest rind,</p>
<p>Such a nut is Rosalind.</p>
<p>He that sweetest rose 639 will find</p>
<p>Must find love’s prick 640 and Rosalind.</p>
<p>This is the very false gallop 641 of verses. Why do you infect
yourself with them?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Truly the tree yields bad fruit 642 .</p>
<p>ROSALIND I’ll graff 643 it with you, and then I shall graff it with a
medlar 644 . Then it will be the earliest fruit i’th’country, for you’ll
be rotten 645 ere you be half ripe, and that’s the right virtue 646 of
the medlar.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE You have said, but whether wisely or no, let the forest
judge.</p>
<p>Enter Celia, with a writing</p>
<p>ROSALIND Peace! Here comes my sister, reading. Stand aside.</p>
<p>They stand aside</p>
<p>CELIA ’Why should this a desert be?</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>For 647 it is unpeopled? No.</p>
<p>Tongues I’ll hang on every tree</p>
<p>That shall civil sayings 648 show.</p>
<p>Some, how brief the life of man</p>
<p>Runs his erring 649 pilgrimage,</p>
<p>That the stretching of a span 650</p>
<p>Buckles in 651 his sum of age.</p>
<p>Some, of violated vows</p>
<p>’Twixt the souls of friend and friend:</p>
<p>But upon the fairest boughs,</p>
<p>Or at every sentence end,</p>
<p>Will I Rosalinda write,</p>
<p>Teaching all that read to know</p>
<p>The quintessence 652 of every sprite 653</p>
<p>Heaven would in little 654 show.</p>
<p>Therefore heaven Nature charged 655</p>
<p>That one body should be filled</p>
<p>With all graces wide-enlarged 656 .</p>
<p>Nature presently 657 distilled</p>
<p>Helen’s cheek, but not her heart 658 ,</p>
<p>Cleopatra 659 ’s majesty,</p>
<p>Atalanta’s better part 660 ,</p>
<p>Sad Lucretia’s modesty 661 .</p>
<p>Thus Rosalind of many parts</p>
<p>By heavenly synod 662 was devised,</p>
<p>Of many faces, eyes and hearts,</p>
<p>To have the touches 663 dearest prized.</p>
<p>Heaven would 664 that she these gifts should have,</p>
<p>And I to 665 live and die her slave.’</p>
<p>ROSALIND O most gentle Jupiter 666 ! What tedious homily of love have
you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried ‘Have patience,
good people!’</p>
<p>Steps forward</p>
<p>CELIA How now? Back 667 , friends. Shepherd, go off a little.— Go
with him, sirrah 668 .</p>
<p>To Touchstone</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat, though
not with bag and baggage 669 , yet with scrip and scrippage 670 .</p>
<p>Exeunt [Corin and Touchstone ]</p>
<p>CELIA Didst thou hear these verses?</p>
<p>ROSALIND O, yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of them had
in them more feet 671 than the verses would bear.</p>
<p>CELIA That’s no matter: the feet might bear the verses.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves
without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.</p>
<p>CELIA But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
hanged and carved upon these trees?</p>
<p>ROSALIND I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder 672 before
you came, for look here what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so
berhymed since Pythagoras 673 ’ time that 674 I was an Irish rat 675 ,
which I can hardly remember.</p>
<p>CELIA Trow 676 you who hath done this?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Is it a man?</p>
<p>CELIA And a chain 677 , that you once wore, about his neck. Change
you colour? 678</p>
<p>ROSALIND I prithee who?</p>
<p>CELIA O lord, lord! It is a hard matter for friends to meet; but
mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter 679 .</p>
<p>ROSALIND Nay, but who is it?</p>
<p>CELIA Is it possible 680 ?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence 681 ,
tell me who it is.</p>
<p>CELIA O wonderful 682 , wonderful, and most wonderful wonderful! And
yet again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping 683 !</p>
<p>ROSALIND Good my complexion! 684 Dost thou think, though I am
caparisoned 685 like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my disposition?
One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery 686 . I prithee tell
me who is it quickly, and speak apace 687 . I would thou couldst
stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth, as
wine comes out of a narrow-mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or
none at all. I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that I may drink
thy tidings.</p>
<p>CELIA So you may put a man in your belly 688 .</p>
<p>ROSALIND Is he of God’s making 689 ? What manner of man? Is his head
worth a hat? Or his chin worth a beard?</p>
<p>CELIA Nay, he hath but a little beard.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Why, God will send more, if the man will be thankful: let me
stay 690 the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of
his chin.</p>
<p>CELIA It is young Orlando that tripped up the wrestler’s heels and
your heart both in an instant.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and true
maid 691 .</p>
<p>CELIA I’faith, coz, ’tis he.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Orlando?</p>
<p>CELIA Orlando.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Alas the day! What shall I do with my doublet and hose? What
did he when thou saw’st him? What said he? How looked he? Wherein went
he? 692 What makes he 693 here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he? How
parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him again? Answer me in one
word.</p>
<p>CELIA You must borrow me Gargantua 694 ’s mouth first: ’tis a word
too great for any mouth of this age’s size. To say ay and no to these
particulars 695 is more than to answer in a catechism 696 .</p>
<p>ROSALIND But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man’s
apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?</p>
<p>CELIA It is as easy to count atomies 697 as to resolve the
propositions 698 of a lover, but take a taste of my finding him, and
relish 699 it with good observance 700 . I found him under a tree, like
a dropped acorn.</p>
<p>ROSALIND It may well be called Jove’s tree 701 , when it drops forth
such fruit.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>CELIA Give me audience 702 , good madam.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Proceed.</p>
<p>CELIA There lay he, stretched along 703 , like a wounded knight.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the
ground.</p>
<p>CELIA Cry ‘holla’ 704 to the tongue, I prithee. It curvets 705
unseasonably. He was furnished 706 like a hunter.</p>
<p>ROSALIND O, ominous! He comes to kill my heart 707 .</p>
<p>CELIA I would sing my song without a burden 708 . Thou bringest me
out of tune.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak.
Sweet, say on.</p>
<p>Enter Orlando and Jaques</p>
<p>CELIA You bring me out 709 . Soft! 710 Comes he not here?</p>
<p>ROSALIND ’Tis he. Slink by, and note him.</p>
<p>They stand aside</p>
<p>JAQUES I thank you for your company, but, good faith, I had as lief
711 have been myself alone.</p>
<p>To Orlando</p>
<p>ORLANDO And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake,</p>
<p>I thank you too for your society 712 .</p>
<p>JAQUES God buy you. Let’s meet as little as we can.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I do desire we may be better strangers.</p>
<p>JAQUES I pray you mar no more trees with writing love-songs in their
barks.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
ill-favouredly 713 .</p>
<p>JAQUES Rosalind is your love’s name?</p>
<p>ORLANDO Yes, just 714 .</p>
<p>JAQUES I do not like her name.</p>
<p>ORLANDO There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
christened.</p>
<p>JAQUES What stature is she of?</p>
<p>ORLANDO Just as high as my heart.</p>
<p>JAQUES You are full of pretty 715 answers. Have you not been
acquainted 716 with goldsmiths’ wives, and conned 717 them out of rings
718 ?</p>
<p>ORLANDO Not so, but I answer you right painted cloth 719 , from
whence you have studied your questions 720 .</p>
<p>JAQUES You have a nimble wit; I think ’twas made of Atalanta 721 ’s
heels. Will you sit down with me? And we two will rail against our
mistress the world and all our misery.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I will chide no breather 722 in the world but myself, against
whom I know most faults.</p>
<p>JAQUES The worst fault you have is to be in love.</p>
<p>ORLANDO ’Tis a fault I will not change 723 for your best virtue. I am
weary of you.</p>
<p>JAQUES By my troth 724 , I was seeking for a fool when I found
you.</p>
<p>ORLANDO He is drowned in the brook. Look but in, and you shall see
him.</p>
<p>JAQUES There I shall see mine own figure 725 .</p>
<p>ORLANDO Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher 726 .</p>
<p>JAQUES I’ll tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good Signior
Love.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I am glad of your departure. Adieu, good Monsieur
Melancholy.</p>
<p>[Exit Jaques ]</p>
<p>ROSALIND I will speak to him like a saucy lackey 727 , and under that
habit 728 play the knave 729 with him.— Do you hear, forester?</p>
<p>Aside to Celia</p>
<p>ORLANDO Very well. What would you?</p>
<p>ROSALIND I pray you, what is’t o’clock?</p>
<p>ORLANDO You should ask me what time o’day: there’s no clock in the
forest.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing
every minute and groaning every hour would detect 730 the lazy foot of
time as well as a clock.</p>
<p>ORLANDO And why not the swift foot of time? Had not that been as
proper?</p>
<p>ROSALIND By no means, sir; time travels in divers 731 paces with
divers persons. I’ll tell you who time ambles withal, who time trots
withal, who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I prithee, who doth he trot withal?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Marry, he trots hard 732 with a young maid between the
contract of her marriage 733 and the day it is solemnized. If the
interim be but a se’nnight 734 , time’s pace is so hard that it seems
the length of seven year.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Who ambles time withal?</p>
<p>ROSALIND With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not
the gout, for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the
other lives merrily because he feels no pain: the one lacking the burden
of lean 735 and wasteful 736 learning, the other knowing no burden of
heavy tedious 737 penury. These time ambles withal.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Who doth he gallop withal?</p>
<p>ROSALIND With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as softly 738
as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Who stays it still withal?</p>
<p>ROSALIND With lawyers in the vacation 739 , for they sleep between
term 740 and term, and then they perceive not how time moves.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Where dwell you, pretty youth?</p>
<p>ROSALIND With this shepherdess, my sister, here in the skirts 741 of
the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Are you native of this place?</p>
<p>ROSALIND As the cony 742 that you see dwell where she is kindled 743
.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Your accent is something finer than you could purchase 744 in
so removed 745 a dwelling.</p>
<p>ROSALIND I have been told so of many: but indeed an old religious 746
uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland 747
man, one that knew courtship 748 too well, for there he fell in love. I
have heard him read many lectures against it, and I thank God I am not a
woman, to be touched 749 with so many giddy offences as he hath
generally 750 taxed their whole sex withal.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to
the charge of women?</p>
<p>ROSALIND There were none principal. They were all like one another as
half-pence are, every one fault seeming monstrous till his 751 fellow
fault came to match it.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I prithee recount some of them.</p>
<p>ROSALIND No, I will not cast away my physic 752 but on those that are
sick. There is a man haunts 753 the forest that abuses our young plants
with carving ‘Rosalind’ on their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and
elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind. If I
could meet that fancy-monger 754 , I would give him some good counsel,
for he seems to have the quotidian 755 of love upon him.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you tell me your
remedy.</p>
<p>ROSALIND There is none of my uncle’s marks 756 upon you: he taught me
how to know a man in love, in which cage of rushes 757 I am sure you are
not prisoner.</p>
<p>ORLANDO What were his marks?</p>
<p>ROSALIND A lean cheek, which you have not: a blue 758 eye and sunken,
which you have not: an unquestionable 759 spirit, which you have not: a
beard neglected, which you have not — but I pardon you for that, for
simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s revenue 760 . Then
your hose should be ungartered 761 , your bonnet unbanded 762 , your
sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied and everything about you
demonstrating a careless desolation: but you are no such man: you are
rather point-device 763 in your accoutrements 764 , as 765 loving
yourself than seeming the lover of any other.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Me believe it? You may as soon make her that you love
believe it, which I warrant she is apter 766 to do than to confess she
does: that is one of the points in the which women still 767 give the
lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth 768 , are you he that hangs
the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired?</p>
<p>ORLANDO I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am
that he, that unfortunate he.</p>
<p>ROSALIND But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?</p>
<p>ORLANDO Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Love is merely 769 a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as
well a dark house and a whip as madmen do 770 : and the reason why they
are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the
whippers are in love too. Yet I profess 771 curing it by counsel.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Did you ever cure any so?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love,
his mistress, and I set him every day to woo me. At which time would I,
being but a moonish 772 youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable,
longing and liking, proud, fantastical 773 , apish 774 , shallow,
inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every passion something
and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women are for the most
part cattle of this colour 775 : would now like him, now loathe him:
then entertain 776 him, then forswear 777 him: now weep for him, then
spit at him; that 778 I drave 779 my suitor from his mad humour of love
to a living 780 humour of madness, which was, to forswear the full
stream of the world, and to live in a nook merely 781 monastic. And thus
I cured him, and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver 782 as
clean as a sound 783 sheep’s heart, that there shall not be one spot of
love in’t.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I would not be cured, youth.</p>
<p>ROSALIND I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind and come
every day to my cote 784 and woo me.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Now, by 785 the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it
is.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Go with me to it and I’ll show it you, and by the way you
shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?</p>
<p>ORLANDO With all my heart, good youth.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Nay, you must call me Rosalind.— Come, sister, will you
go?</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
