<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-8-873">Scene 1 ／ running scene 8 873</h4>
<p>Enter Queen [Katherine ] and her Women, as at work</p>
<p>One with a lute 874</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Take thy lute, wench: my soul grows sad with
troubles:</p>
<p>Sing, and disperse ’em, if thou canst: leave 875 working.</p>
<p>WOMAN Orpheus 876 with his lute made 877 trees,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>And the mountain tops that freeze,</p>
<p>Bow themselves when he did sing.</p>
<p>To his music plants and flowers</p>
<p>Ever sprung, as 878 sun and showers</p>
<p>There had made a lasting spring.</p>
<p>Every thing that heard him play,</p>
<p>Even the billows 879 of the sea,</p>
<p>Hung their heads, and then lay by 880 .</p>
<p>In sweet music is such art,</p>
<p>Killing 881 care and grief of heart</p>
<p>Fall asleep, or hearing, die.</p>
<p>Enter [Griffith ] a Gentleman</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE How now?</p>
<p>GRIFFITH An’t please your grace, the two great cardinals</p>
<p>Wait in the presence 882 .</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Would they speak with me?</p>
<p>GRIFFITH They willed 883 me say so, madam.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Pray 884 their graces</p>
<p>To come near.</p>
<p>[Exit Griffith ]</p>
<p>What can be their business</p>
<p>With me, a poor weak woman, fall’n from favour?</p>
<p>I do not like their coming: now I think on’t,</p>
<p>They should be good men, their affairs as righteous 885 :</p>
<p>But all hoods make not monks.</p>
<p>Enter the two Cardinals, Wolsey and Campeius</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Peace to your highness.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Your graces find me here part of 886 a housewife:</p>
<p>I would be all 887 , against 888 the worst 889 may happen.</p>
<p>What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY May it please you, noble madam, to withdraw</p>
<p>Into your private chamber: we shall give you</p>
<p>The full cause of our coming.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Speak it here.</p>
<p>There’s nothing I have done yet, o’ my conscience,</p>
<p>Deserves a corner 890 : would all other women</p>
<p>Could speak this with as free 891 a soul as I do.</p>
<p>My lords, I care not, so much I am happy 892</p>
<p>Above a number 893 , if my actions</p>
<p>Were tried by ev’ry tongue, ev’ry eye saw ’em,</p>
<p>Envy 894 and base opinion set against ’em,</p>
<p>I know my life so even 895 . If your business</p>
<p>Seek me out, and that way I am wife in 896 ,</p>
<p>Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, Regina
serenissima 897 —</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE O, good my lord, no Latin:</p>
<p>I am not such a truant 898 since my coming 899 ,</p>
<p>As not to know the language I have lived in:</p>
<p>A strange 900 tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious:</p>
<p>Pray, speak in English: here are some will thank you,</p>
<p>If you speak truth, for their poor mistress’ sake:</p>
<p>Believe me, she has had much wrong. Lord cardinal,</p>
<p>The willing’st 901 sin I ever yet committed</p>
<p>May be absolved in English.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Noble lady,</p>
<p>I am sorry my integrity should breed,</p>
<p>And service to his majesty and you,</p>
<p>So deep suspicion, where all 902 faith 903 was meant:</p>
<p>We come not by the way 904 of accusation,</p>
<p>To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,</p>
<p>Nor to betray you any way to sorrow:</p>
<p>You have too much, good lady: but to know</p>
<p>How you stand minded 905 in the weighty difference 906</p>
<p>Between the king and you, and to deliver,</p>
<p>Like free 907 and honest men, our just opinions</p>
<p>And comforts to your cause.</p>
<p>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS Most honoured madam,</p>
<p>My lord of York, out of his noble nature,</p>
<p>Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,</p>
<p>Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure</p>
<p>Both of his truth and him, which was too far,</p>
<p>Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,</p>
<p>His service and his counsel.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE To betray me.—</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>My lords, I thank you both for your good wills:</p>
<p>Aloud</p>
<p>Ye speak like honest men:— pray God ye prove so.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>But how to make ye suddenly 908 an answer</p>
<p>In such a point of weight, so near mine honour —</p>
<p>More near my life, I fear — with my weak wit 909 ,</p>
<p>And to such men of gravity and learning:</p>
<p>In truth I know not. I was set 910 at work</p>
<p>Among my maids, full little, God knows, looking 911</p>
<p>Either for such men or such business:</p>
<p>For her sake that I have been 912 — for I feel</p>
<p>The last fit 913 of my greatness — good your graces,</p>
<p>Let me have time and counsel for my cause:</p>
<p>Alas, I am a woman friendless, hopeless.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Madam, you wrong the king’s love with these
fears.</p>
<p>Your hopes and friends are infinite.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE In England</p>
<p>But little for my profit 914 : can you think, lords,</p>
<p>That any Englishman dare give me counsel?</p>
<p>Or be a known friend gainst his highness’ pleasure,</p>
<p>Though he be grown so desperate 915 to be honest,</p>
<p>And live a subject 916 ? Nay forsooth 917 , my friends,</p>
<p>They that must weigh out 918 my afflictions,</p>
<p>They that my trust must grow to, live not here:</p>
<p>They are, as all my other comforts, far hence</p>
<p>In mine own country, lords.</p>
<p>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS I would your grace</p>
<p>Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE How, sir?</p>
<p>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS Put your main cause into the king’s protection:</p>
<p>He’s loving and most gracious. ’Twill be much</p>
<p>Both for your honour better and your cause:</p>
<p>For if the trial of the law o’ertake ye,</p>
<p>You’ll part away 919 disgraced.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY He tells you rightly.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Ye tell me what ye wish for both — my ruin:</p>
<p>Is this your Christian counsel? Out upon ye 920 .</p>
<p>Heaven is above all yet: there sits a judge</p>
<p>That no king can corrupt.</p>
<p>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS Your rage mistakes 921 us.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,</p>
<p>Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues 922 :</p>
<p>But cardinal sins 923 and hollow hearts I fear ye:</p>
<p>Mend ’em for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?</p>
<p>The cordial 924 that ye bring a wretched lady?</p>
<p>A woman lost among ye, laughed at, scorned?</p>
<p>I will not wish ye half my miseries:</p>
<p>I have more charity. But say I warned ye:</p>
<p>Take heed, for heaven’s sake, take heed, lest at once 925</p>
<p>The burden of my sorrows fall upon ye.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Madam, this is a mere distraction 926 :</p>
<p>You turn the good we offer into envy 927 .</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Ye turn me into nothing. Woe upon ye</p>
<p>And all such false professors 928 . Would you have me —</p>
<p>If you have any justice, any pity,</p>
<p>If ye be anything but churchmen’s habits 929 —</p>
<p>Put my sick cause into his 930 hands that hates me?</p>
<p>Alas, he’s banished me his bed already,</p>
<p>His love, too long ago. I am old, my lords,</p>
<p>And all the fellowship 931 I hold now with him</p>
<p>Is only my obedience. What can happen</p>
<p>To me above 932 this wretchedness? All your studies 933</p>
<p>Make me a curse like this.</p>
<p>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS Your fears are worse.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Have I lived thus long — let me speak 934 myself,</p>
<p>Since virtue finds no friends — a wife, a true one?</p>
<p>A woman, I dare say without vainglory 935 ,</p>
<p>Never yet branded with suspicion?</p>
<p>Have I with all my full affections 936</p>
<p>Still 937 met the king? Loved him next 938 heaven? Obeyed him?</p>
<p>Been, out of fondness 939 , superstitious 940 to him?</p>
<p>Almost forgot my prayers to content him?</p>
<p>And am I thus rewarded? ’Tis not well, lords.</p>
<p>Bring me a constant woman to her husband,</p>
<p>One that ne’er dreamed a joy beyond his pleasure,</p>
<p>And to that woman, when she has done most,</p>
<p>Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Madam, you wander from 941 the good we aim at.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,</p>
<p>To give up willingly that noble title</p>
<p>Your master wed me to: nothing but death</p>
<p>Shall e’er divorce my dignities 942 .</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Pray, hear me.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Would 943 I had never trod this English earth,</p>
<p>Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it:</p>
<p>Ye have angels’ faces, but heaven knows your hearts.</p>
<p>What will become of me now, wretched lady?</p>
<p>I am the most unhappy woman living.</p>
<p>Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes?</p>
<p>Shipwrecked upon a kingdom, where no pity,</p>
<p>No friends, no hope, no kindred weep for me?</p>
<p>Almost no grave allowed me? Like the lily</p>
<p>That once was mistress of the field and flourished,</p>
<p>I’ll hang my head and perish.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY If your grace</p>
<p>Could but be brought to know our ends 944 are honest,</p>
<p>You’d feel more comfort. Why should we, good lady,</p>
<p>Upon what cause, wrong you? Alas, our places 945 ,</p>
<p>The way of our profession is against it:</p>
<p>We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow ’em.</p>
<p>For goodness’ sake, consider what you do,</p>
<p>How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly</p>
<p>Grow from the king’s acquaintance, by this carriage 946 .</p>
<p>The hearts of princes kiss obedience,</p>
<p>So much they love it, but to stubborn spirits</p>
<p>They swell and grow as terrible as storms.</p>
<p>I know you have a gentle, noble temper 947 ,</p>
<p>A soul as even 948 as a calm 949 : pray think us</p>
<p>Those we profess: peacemakers, friends and servants.</p>
<p>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS Madam, you’ll find it so: you wrong your
virtues</p>
<p>With these weak women’s fears. A noble spirit,</p>
<p>As yours was put into you, ever casts 950</p>
<p>Such doubts as false coin from it. The king loves you:</p>
<p>Beware you lose it not: for us, if you please</p>
<p>To trust us in your business, we are ready</p>
<p>To use our utmost studies 951 in your service.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Do what ye will, my lords: and pray forgive me</p>
<p>If I have used 952 myself unmannerly.</p>
<p>You know I am a woman, lacking wit</p>
<p>To make a seemly answer to such persons.</p>
<p>Pray do my service 953 to his majesty:</p>
<p>He has my heart yet, and shall have my prayers</p>
<p>While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,</p>
<p>Bestow your counsels on me. She now begs,</p>
<p>That 954 little thought, when she set footing here 955 ,</p>
<p>She should have bought her dignities so dear.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
