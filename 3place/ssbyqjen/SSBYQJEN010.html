<h4 id="scene-2running-scene-4">Scene 2／running scene 4</h4>
<p>Enter Caliban with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard</p>
<p>CALIBAN All the infections that the sun sucks up</p>
<p>From bogs, fens, flats 524 , on Prosper fall, and make him</p>
<p>By inch-meal 525 a disease. His spirits hear me,</p>
<p>And yet I needs must curse. But they’ll nor 526 pinch 527 ,</p>
<p>Fright me with urchin-shows 528 , pitch me i’th’mire,</p>
<p>Nor lead me like a firebrand 529 in the dark</p>
<p>Out of my way, unless he bid ’em: but</p>
<p>For every trifle are they set upon me,</p>
<p>Sometime like apes, that mow 530 and chatter at me,</p>
<p>And after bite me: then like hedgehogs, which</p>
<p>Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount</p>
<p>Their pricks at my footfall: sometime am I</p>
<p>All wound 531 with adders, who with cloven 532 tongues</p>
<p>Do hiss me into madness.</p>
<p>Enter Trinculo 533</p>
<p>Lo 534 , now, lo!</p>
<p>Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me</p>
<p>For bringing wood in slowly. I’ll fall flat:</p>
<p>Perchance he will not mind 535 me.</p>
<p>Lies down and covers himself with his cloak</p>
<p>TRINCULO Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off 536 any weather at
all, and another storm brewing: I hear it sing i’th’wind: yond same
black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard 537 that would
shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where
to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls.
What have we here? A man or a fish? Dead or alive? A fish, he smells
like a fish: a very ancient and fishlike smell: a kind of
not-of-the-newest poor-John 538 . A strange fish! Were I in England now
— as once I was — and had but this fish painted 539 , not a holiday fool
there but would give a piece of silver: there would this monster make a
man 540 : any strange beast there makes a man: when they will not give a
doit 541 to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead
Indian 542 . Legged 543 like a man and his fins like arms! Warm, o’my
troth! I do now let loose 544 my opinion, hold it no longer: this is no
fish, but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt. Alas,
the storm is come again! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine 545
: there is no other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man with
strange bedfellows: I will here shroud 546 till the dregs of the storm
be past.</p>
<p>Sees Caliban</p>
<p>Thunder</p>
<p>Trinculo gets under</p>
<p>Caliban’s cloak</p>
<p>Enter Stephano, singing</p>
<p>With a bottle in his hand</p>
<p>STEPHANO I shall no more to sea, to sea:</p>
<p>Here shall I die ashore—</p>
<p>This is a very scurvy 547 tune to sing at a man’s funeral: well,
here’s my comfort.</p>
<p>Drinks</p>
<p>The master, the swabber 548 , the boatswain and I,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>The gunner and his mate,</p>
<p>Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,</p>
<p>But none of us cared for Kate.</p>
<p>For she had a tongue with a tang 549 ,</p>
<p>Would cry to a sailor, ‘Go hang!’</p>
<p>She loved not the savour 550 of tar nor of pitch,</p>
<p>Yet a tailor might scratch her where’er she did itch 551 :</p>
<p>Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!</p>
<p>This is a scurvy tune too: but here’s my comfort.</p>
<p>Drinks</p>
<p>CALIBAN Do not torment me: O!</p>
<p>STEPHANO What’s the matter 552 ? Have we devils here? Do you put
tricks upon’s with savages and men of Ind 553 , ha? I have not scaped
drowning to be afeard now of your four legs: for it hath been said, ‘As
proper 554 a man as ever went on four legs 555 , cannot make him give
ground 556’: and it shall be said so again, while Stephano breathes
at’nostrils 557 .</p>
<p>CALIBAN The spirit torments me: O!</p>
<p>STEPHANO This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath
got, as I take it, an ague 558 . Where the devil should he learn our
language? I will give him some relief 559 , if it be but for that. If I
can recover 560 him, and keep him tame, and get to Naples with him, he’s
a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat’s leather 561 .</p>
<p>CALIBAN Do not torment me, prithee: I’ll bring my wood home
faster.</p>
<p>STEPHANO He’s in his fit now, and does not talk after 562 the wisest.
He shall taste of my bottle: if he have never drunk wine afore, it will
go near to remove his fit. If I can recover him 563 and keep him tame, I
will not take too much for him: he shall pay for him that hath him, and
that soundly.</p>
<p>CALIBAN Thou dost me yet but little hurt: thou wilt anon 564 , I know
it by thy trembling. Now Prosper works upon thee.</p>
<p>STEPHANO Come on your ways 565 : open your mouth: here is that which
will give language to you, cat 566 . Open your mouth: this will shake
567 your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly: you cannot tell
who’s your friend: open your chaps 568 again.</p>
<p>Gives Caliban</p>
<p>a drink</p>
<p>Caliban spits it out</p>
<p>TRINCULO I should know that voice: it should be— but he is drowned,
and these are devils. O, defend me!</p>
<p>STEPHANO Four legs and two voices: a most delicate 569 monster! His
forward voice now is to speak well of his friend: his backward voice is
to utter foul speeches and to detract 570 . If all the wine in my bottle
will recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I will pour some in
thy other mouth.</p>
<p>TRINCULO Stephano!</p>
<p>STEPHANO Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is a devil,
and no monster: I will leave him, I have no long spoon 571 .</p>
<p>TRINCULO Stephano! If thou be’st Stephano, touch me and speak to me,
for I am Trinculo — be not afeard — thy good friend Trinculo.</p>
<p>STEPHANO If thou be’st Trinculo, come forth: I’ll pull thee by the
lesser legs 572 . If any be Trinculo’s legs, these are they. Thou art
very Trinculo indeed! How cam’st thou to be the siege 573 of this
moon-calf 574 ? Can he vent 575 Trinculos?</p>
<p>Pulls him out</p>
<p>TRINCULO I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke: but art thou
not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art not drowned: is the storm
overblown 576 ? I hid me under the dead moon-calf ’s gaberdine for fear
of the storm: and art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans
scaped!</p>
<p>Trinculo and Stephano embrace or dance</p>
<p>STEPHANO Prithee, do not turn me about: my stomach is not
constant.</p>
<p>CALIBAN These be fine things, an if 577 they be not sprites. That’s a
brave god and bears celestial liquor: I will kneel to him.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>STEPHANO How didst thou scape? How cam’st thou hither? Swear by this
bottle how thou cam’st hither. I escaped upon a butt of sack 578 which
the sailors heaved o’erboard, by this bottle which I made of the bark of
a tree with mine own hands since I was cast ashore.</p>
<p>CALIBAN I’ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject, for the
liquor is not earthly.</p>
<p>STEPHANO Here: swear then how thou escap’dst.</p>
<p>TRINCULO Swum ashore, man, like a duck: I can swim like a duck, I’ll
be sworn.</p>
<p>STEPHANO Here, kiss the book 579 . Though thou canst swim like a
duck, thou art made like a goose 580 .</p>
<p>Gives Trinculo the bottle</p>
<p>TRINCULO O Stephano, hast any more of this?</p>
<p>STEPHANO The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by th’sea-side,
where my wine is hid.— How now, moon-calf? How does thine ague?</p>
<p>To Caliban</p>
<p>CALIBAN Hast thou not dropped from heaven?</p>
<p>STEPHANO Out o’th’moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i’th’moon
when time was 581 .</p>
<p>CALIBAN I have seen thee in her, and I do adore 582 thee: my mistress
583 showed me thee, and thy dog, and thy bush 584 .</p>
<p>STEPHANO Come, swear to that: kiss the book: I will furnish it anon
with new contents 585 . Swear.</p>
<p>Gives Caliban</p>
<p>the bottle</p>
<p>Caliban drinks</p>
<p>TRINCULO By this good light 586 , this is a very shallow 587 monster!
I afeard of him? A very weak monster! The man i’th’moon? A most poor,
credulous monster! Well drawn 588 , monster, in good sooth 589 !</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>CALIBAN I’ll show thee every fertile inch o’th’island: and I will
kiss thy foot. I prithee, be my god.</p>
<p>TRINCULO By this light, a most perfidious 590 and drunken monster!
When’s god’s asleep, he’ll rob his bottle.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>CALIBAN I’ll kiss thy foot: I’ll swear myself thy subject.</p>
<p>STEPHANO Come on then: down, and swear.</p>
<p>Caliban kneels</p>
<p>TRINCULO I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed 591
monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my heart to beat
him—</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>STEPHANO Come, kiss.</p>
<p>To Caliban</p>
<p>TRINCULO —But that the poor monster’s in drink 592 : an abominable
monster!</p>
<p>CALIBAN I’ll show thee the best springs: I’ll pluck thee berries:
I’ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough. A plague upon the tyrant
that I serve! I’ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee, thou
wondrous man.</p>
<p>TRINCULO A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor
drunkard!</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>CALIBAN I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs 593 grow: and I with
my long nails will dig thee pignuts 594 : show thee a jay’s nest and
instruct thee how to snare the nimble marmoset 595 : I’ll bring thee to
clust’ring filberts 596 , and sometimes I’ll get thee young scamels 597
from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?</p>
<p>STEPHANO I prithee, now lead the way without any more talking.
Trinculo, the king and all our company else being drowned, we will
inherit here.— Here, bear my bottle. Fellow Trinculo, we’ll fill him by
and by again.</p>
<p>To Caliban</p>
<p>CALIBAN Farewell master: farewell, farewell!</p>
<p>Sings drunkenly</p>
<p>TRINCULO A howling monster: a drunken monster!</p>
<p>CALIBAN No more dams I’ll make for 598 fish,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Nor fetch in firing 599 at requiring,</p>
<p>Nor scrape trencher 600 , nor wash dish,</p>
<p>’Ban, ’Ban, Cacaliban</p>
<p>Has a new master: get a new man.</p>
<p>Freedom, high-day 601 ! High-day, freedom! Freedom, high-day,
freedom!</p>
<p>STEPHANO O brave monster, lead the way!</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
