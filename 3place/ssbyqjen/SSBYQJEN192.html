<h4 id="introduction-to-as-you-like-it">Introduction to As You Like
It</h4>
<p>As You Like It is Shakespeare’s most elegant play. At its climax
Rosalind calls the cast into a circle, the figure of perfection, and
resolves the plot with the assistance of Hymen, god of marriage. Whereas
most of the other comedies are shadowed by death, this one offers four
weddings and no funeral. The part of Rosalind is the longest and most
joyous female role in the complete works. It would have been
extraordinarily demanding for the boy-actor who first performed it,
though made a little easier by the fact that Rosalind spends so much of
the time dressed as a boy.</p>
<p>By rights, the play should have been named after its heroine. It is
the Elizabethan equivalent of an ‘adapted’ as opposed to an ‘original’
screenplay: a dramatization of a popular novel of the day, Thomas
Lodge’s Rosalynde . Shakespeare selects and compresses his material, but
retains its essential spirit as a series of debates on the nature of
love played out against a romantic woodland backdrop. The flavour of
Lodge’s story, its language studded with allusions to classical
mythology, may be tasted from the climactic moment when Rosalynde
reverts to her female identity: ‘In went Ganimede and dressed herself in
woman’s attire, having on a gown of green, with kirtle of rich sandal,
so quaint that she seemed Diana triumphing in the forest; upon her head
she wore a chaplet of roses, which gave her such a grace that she looked
like Flora perked in the pride of all her flowers.’</p>
<p>Shakespeare moves quickly from the multiple marriages to the closing
dance. He introduces the magical ‘conversion’ of bad Frederick in place
of the battle between the forces of good and evil that occurs at the end
of Lodge’s story, and he focuses on the realization of erotic desire
rather than the questions of social advancement that preoccupied Lodge.
The play omits the apportioning of rewards with which Rosalynde ended.
In the novel, the figure who corresponds to Sylvanus becomes ‘lord over
all the forest of Arden’, Corin is made master of the Celia-figure’s
flock, and loyal retainer Adam improbably becomes captain of the king’s
guard.</p>
<p>Lodge’s setting was France, but he anglicized the name of the
Ardennes forest to Arden. Perhaps this is what made the story so
attractive to Shakespeare, who was born and raised close to the Forest
of Arden in Warwickshire, from which his mother, Mary Arden, took her
family name. The play accordingly removes the action further from
France: though a few French names such as ‘Le Beau’ are retained, the
location of the court is not specified. The deceased gentleman with
three sons - the oldest who treats the youngest like a mere servant, the
middle away at university and invisible until the closing twist - is Sir
John of Bordeaux in Lodge, but the more symbolically named Sir Rowland
de Bois in Shakespeare. De Bois means ‘of the woods’ and Sir Rowland is
a name suggestive of a lost world of chivalry and romance, as in The
Song of Roland . ‘Orlando’, the Italianized form of Rowland, is chosen
by Shakespeare for his hero as a way of indicating that the youngest son
has a special bond with his dead father, a duty to preserve his good
name. To more educated members of the Elizabethan theatre audience, it
would also have conjured up the eponymous hero of Orlando Furioso , an
epic poem by Ariosto that was the sixteenth century’s great exemplar of
chivalric romance. It is typical of Shakespeare’s sceptical, ironic
temperament that the Orlando who wanders round the forest defacing trees
with second-rate love poems, and who needs to take lessons in courtship
from a supposed teenage boy, does not quite live up to his heroic name -
not, at least, until the play moves into the true mode of romance when
he rescues his brother from a lion and a snake.</p>
<p>The first we hear of the exiled duke is that, ‘like the old Robin
Hood of England’, he is in the forest with a group of ‘merry men’.
Ostensibly the qualifier ‘of England’ is an indication that the action
is supposed to take place in France, but the deeper effect is to
identify Arden with Sherwood. About a year before the play was written,
rival acting company the Admiral’s Men had played a two-part drama on
the subject of Robin Hood called Robert Earl of Huntingdon - the first
work in the long history of the legend to turn Robin into a disguised
aristocrat as opposed to a genuinely subversive outlaw. The Arden scenes
of As You Like It begin with the exiled duke contrasting the natural
order of the forest to the flattery and envy of the court. As in the
Robin Hood story, the wished-for conclusion is the restoration of the
right ruler.</p>
<p>Yet the play ironizes as well as idealizes. The most prominent figure
in the duke’s forest circle is not a merry man but a melancholy man, the
satirical Jaques. Often wrongly described as one of the duke’s
courtiers, he is a gentleman who has sold his lands in order to become a
‘traveller’, a wry detached observer of manners and morals. The forest
order is dependent on hunting, leading Jaques to sympathize with the
wounded stag and suggest that the good duke usurps the place of the deer
every bit as much as the bad duke has usurped power back at court.
Jaques and Touchstone - the two key characters invented by Shakespeare
without precedent in Lodge - spar with each other because the satire of
the former and the witty foolery of the latter are rival modes of
mocking courtly pretensions such as Orlando’s highly romanticized
language of love-service.</p>
<p>Arden is also compared to the mythological ‘golden age’ and the play
duly has its complement of classically named shepherds, signalling the
influence of the ancient tradition of pastoral verse. The golden age was
the imagined infancy of humankind, another Eden, a playground in which
Nature offered up her fruits and the winter wind never blew. But
Shakespeare complicates the picture. The duke’s very first speech sees
Arden as a place less to ‘fleet the time carelessly as they did in the
golden world’ than to draw moral lessons from the natural world. This is
no Arcadia of perpetual summer: the seasons do change, it is just that
‘the penalty of Adam’ - being forced to labour for subsistence - seems
less harsh than the vicissitudes of the court. The myth of the golden
age made Utopia into the state that society had fallen from rather than
that which it aspired to: a place where everybody was happy and there
was no such thing as property. The old shepherd Corin is a voice of
happiness, but he has no illusions about the need for labour and his
dependence on property that he does not own. He is shepherd to another
man’s flock and only keeps his job because Celia buys the farm.</p>
<p>Many of Shakespeare’s plays keep up a constant shuttle between
symbolically opposed locations - Venice and Belmont, Rome and Egypt,
Sicilian court and Bohemian country - but As You Like It moves all the
major players to Arden as swiftly as possible. Once there, the scenes
run together fluently. There is no clock ticking in the forest, no sense
of time being marked by the scene breaks. Initially, however, there are
two discernible imaginary locations: the farm and the cave, Corin’s
world of agricultural labour and the deep forest where the duke and his
men play at being Robin Hood. Orlando and Jaques drift between the two,
whereas Rosalind/Ganymede and Celia/Aliena are not allowed to penetrate
too far into the deep forest. Their reunion with the duke must be
withheld for the climax.</p>
<p>There is a curious stage direction when the women first arrive in
Arden: ‘Enter Rosalind for Ganymede, Celia for Aliena, and Clown alias
Touchstone’. Does alias mean that Touchstone has also taken on a
disguised identity? It has been suggested that he would have begun the
play in the long plain coat of the ‘natural’ (simpleton), then exchanged
this for the ‘motley’ of the professional fool when he escapes from the
court with the women. But there is no sense of his verbal style changing
or of disguise being a means of self-discovery, as it is so profoundly
for Rosalind when she plays the role of Ganymede; Touchstone appears
always to have been a touchstone, a master of retort that reveals other
people’s foolishness. The question of Touchstone being recognized as the
court fool, and thus blowing the disguise of Rosalind and Celia, is
avoided by the device of keeping all three of them apart from the duke
and his courtiers until the final scene. That is why Jaques cannot be a
courtier: he must encounter Touchstone as a stranger and delight in him
as a fellow outsider, albeit with a different linguistic style and a
different end to his irony. Jaques offers ‘invective’ and formal
discourses (most famously his anatomy of the ‘seven ages’ of human life)
to Touchstone’s one-line quips and riffs of extended word-mongering
(most dazzlingly his explication of the seven stages of a quarrel).</p>
<p>Wherever the word ‘natural’ is found in the play, whether associated
with Touchstone, Corin or the forest itself, it is possible to see
happiness and a kind of innocence; the voice of Jaques is that of
‘experience’ bringing world-weary melancholy. Rosalind has no doubt
which she prefers, observing to Jaques that ‘your experience makes you
sad: I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make
me sad.’</p>
<p>As in Lodge’s Rosalynde , the plot of the play sometimes seems little
more than a pretext for the setting up of debates and meditations. The
heart of the play is to be found in the set-piece dialogues. Before
their departure from court, Rosalind and Celia debate the relative
importance of ‘Nature’ and ‘Fortune’; in Arden, there are dialogues
between the melancholy man and the fool, the cynic and the lover, the
court fool and the ‘natural’ shepherd (who wins the debate by virtue of
his recognition that social customs vary from place to place). With
brilliant counterpoint, a prose wooing scene is played against a verse
one. Reversing dramatic convention, it is the courtly characters who
speak prose and the shepherds who court in verse.</p>
<p>Above all, there is the encounter between Orlando and
Rosalind-as-Ganymede-as-Rosalind. With the added layer of the boy-actor
for whom Shakespeare was writing - of which we are reminded by means of
a joke in the epilogue - here a boy plays a girl playing a boy playing a
girl. Whereas in the shepherd plot it is Phoebe who has romantic notions
about love that make her natural partner Silvius a disappointment to
her, in the main plot disguise enables the woman to offer the man
down-to-earth ‘counsel’ as preparation for marriage. Through the
illusions of cross-dressing and role-play, Rosalind exposes the
illusions of romantic desire: ‘the patterns of love’ (Troilus, Leander)
are not to be imitated, since the old stories about them are ‘all lies’.
‘Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them, but not for
love.’ So much for men.</p>
<p>As for women, the key to keeping them is not to restrain them.
Rosalind/Ganymede’s lesson is the opposite to that of The Taming of the
Shrew : a desirable woman is not a tame one but a ‘wayward’ one, whose
energies (verbal, emotional and sexual) are incorrigible. ‘Make the
doors upon a woman’s wit and it will out at the casement. Shut that and
’twill out at the key-hole. Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at
the chimney.’ In her poise and her playfulness, her knowledge of what
makes people tick and her capacity for strong feeling, whether joyful,
fearful or simply amazed (‘O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that
thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be
sounded’), Rosalind is Shakespeare’s most complete woman.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Orlando is the youngest of three brothers, badly treated by the
oldest, Oliver; Duke Senior, meanwhile, has been banished and the court
usurped by his younger brother, Frederick. Orlando fights with Charles,
the court wrestler, and he and Rosalind, daughter of the exiled duke,
fall in love. Rosalind and her cousin Celia, daughter of usurping Duke
Frederick, leave the court for the Forest of Arden, taking the fool
Touchstone with them; Rosalind disguises herself as a boy (‘Ganymede’),
while Celia calls herself ‘Aliena’. On being told by the old family
servant Adam that Oliver is plotting to kill him, Orlando also flees to
the forest. In Arden, Rosalind and Celia buy a farm in order to help the
old shepherd Corin; Orlando meets up with the banished duke and his
courtiers. ‘Ganymede’ offers to assist Orlando in his wooing by
pretending to be Rosalind, so that he can rehearse his love-lines. The
shepherd Silvius is in love with shepherdess Phoebe, but she falls for
‘Ganymede’. Touchstone, after initially scorning rural life, decides to
marry Audrey the goatherd, displacing country bumpkin William. Oliver
comes to the forest and his life is saved by Orlando; he repents of his
wicked ways and falls in love with Celia. Wicked Duke Frederick becomes
a hermit and Rosalind, restored to her female self, arranges multiple
marriages, presided over by the god Hymen. All ends happily, save that
the melancholy traveller Jaques wants no part in the festivities.</p>

<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 55% prose, 45% verse. Several songs and interwoven
(parodically bad) love-lyrics.</p>
<p>DATE: Not mentioned in Francis Meres’ 1598 list of Shakespeare’s
plays, unless originally called Love’s Labour’s Won (mentioned by Meres,
but now lost). Registered for publication in early summer 1600, but not
printed at that time. Song ‘It was a lover and his lass’ printed in
Thomas Morley’s First Book of Airs (1600). Several literary allusions
suggest composition in 1599 or early 1600.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Based closely on Thomas Lodge’s prose romance Rosalynde
(1590). Some names altered (e.g. Oliver and Orlando for Lodge’s Saladyne
and Rosader), others retained (e.g. Phoebe, ‘Aliena’, ‘Ganymede’). Only
major additions are characters of Jaques and Touchstone.</p>
<p>TEXT: First printed in the 1623 Folio. Very high quality printing,
perhaps from the theatrical ‘book’.</p>
