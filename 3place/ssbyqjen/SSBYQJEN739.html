<h4 id="scene-2-443-running-scene-3">Scene 2 443 / running scene 3</h4>
<p>Enter Exeter, Bedford and Westmorland</p>
<p>BEDFORD ’Fore God, his grace is bold 444 to trust these traitors.</p>
<p>EXETER They shall be apprehended 445 by and by.</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND How smooth 446 and even 447 they do bear 448
themselves,</p>
<p>As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,</p>
<p>Crownèd with faith and constant loyalty.</p>
<p>BEDFORD The king hath note 449 of all that they intend,</p>
<p>By interception 450 which they dream not of.</p>
<p>EXETER Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow 451 ,</p>
<p>Whom he hath dulled 452 and cloyed 453 with gracious favours,</p>
<p>That he should for a foreign purse 454 so sell</p>
<p>His sovereign’s life to death and treachery.</p>
<p>Sound trumpets</p>
<p>Enter the King, Scroop, Cambridge, Grey [and Attendants ]</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.——</p>
<p>My lord of Cambridge, and my kind lord of Masham,</p>
<p>And you, my gentle 455 knight, give me your thoughts:</p>
<p>Think you not that the powers 456 we bear with us</p>
<p>Will cut their passage through the force of France,</p>
<p>Doing the execution 457 and the act</p>
<p>For which we have in head 458 assembled them?</p>
<p>SCROOP No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V I doubt not that, since we are well persuaded</p>
<p>We carry not a heart with us from hence</p>
<p>That grows not in a fair consent 459 with ours,</p>
<p>Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish</p>
<p>Success and conquest to attend on 460 us.</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE Never was monarch better feared 461 and loved</p>
<p>Than is your majesty: there’s not, I think, a subject</p>
<p>That sits in heart-grief 462 and uneasiness</p>
<p>Under the sweet shade of your government.</p>
<p>GREY True: those that were your father’s enemies</p>
<p>Have steeped their galls in honey 463 and do serve you</p>
<p>With hearts create 464 of duty and of zeal.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V We therefore have great cause of thankfulness,</p>
<p>And shall forget the office 465 of our hand,</p>
<p>Sooner than quittance 466 of desert and merit 467</p>
<p>According to the weight and worthiness 468 .</p>
<p>SCROOP So service shall with steelèd 469 sinews toil,</p>
<p>And labour shall refresh itself with hope,</p>
<p>To do your grace incessant services.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V We judge 470 no less.—— Uncle of Exeter,</p>
<p>Enlarge 471 the man committed 472 yesterday,</p>
<p>That railed 473 against our person: we consider</p>
<p>It was excess of wine that set him on,</p>
<p>And on his more advice 474 we pardon him.</p>
<p>SCROOP That’s mercy, but too much security 475 .</p>
<p>Let him be punished, sovereign, lest example</p>
<p>Breed, by his sufferance 476 , more of such a kind.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V O, let us yet be merciful.</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE So may your highness, and yet punish too.</p>
<p>GREY Sir,</p>
<p>You show great mercy, if you give him life,</p>
<p>After the taste of much correction 477 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Alas, your too much love and care of me</p>
<p>Are heavy orisons 478 gainst this poor wretch!</p>
<p>If little faults, proceeding on distemper 479</p>
<p>Shall not be winked at 480 , how shall we stretch our eye 481</p>
<p>When capital 482 crimes, chewed, swallowed and digested 483 ,</p>
<p>Appear before us? —— We’ll yet enlarge that man,</p>
<p>Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear 484 care</p>
<p>And tender preservation of our person,</p>
<p>Would have him punished. —— And now to our French causes:</p>
<p>Who are the late commissioners 485 ?</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE I one, my lord.</p>
<p>Your highness bade me ask for it today.</p>
<p>SCROOP So did you me, my liege.</p>
<p>GREY And I, my royal sovereign.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours.——</p>
<p>Gives each a paper</p>
<p>There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham.—— And, sir knight,</p>
<p>Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours.</p>
<p>Read them, and know I know your worthiness.——</p>
<p>My lord of Westmorland, and uncle Exeter,</p>
<p>We will aboard tonight.—— Why, how now, gentlemen?</p>
<p>What see you in those papers that you lose</p>
<p>So much complexion 486 ?—— Look ye, how they change:</p>
<p>Their cheeks are paper 487 .—— Why, what read you there</p>
<p>That hath so cowarded and chased your blood</p>
<p>Out of appearance 488 ?</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE I do confess my fault,</p>
<p>And do submit me to your highness’ mercy.</p>
<p>GREY and SCROOP To which we all appeal.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V The mercy that was quick 489 in us but late,</p>
<p>By your own counsel is suppressed and killed.</p>
<p>You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy,</p>
<p>For your own reasons 490 turn into your bosoms,</p>
<p>As dogs upon their masters, worrying 491 you.——</p>
<p>See you, my princes, and my noble peers,</p>
<p>These English monsters. My lord of Cambridge here,</p>
<p>You know how apt our love was to accord 492</p>
<p>To furnish 493 him with all appertinents</p>
<p>Belonging to his honour 494 ; and this man</p>
<p>Hath, for a few light 495 crowns, lightly 496 conspired</p>
<p>And sworn unto the practices 497 of France</p>
<p>To kill us here in Hampton. To the which</p>
<p>This knight 498 , no less for bounty 499 bound to us</p>
<p>Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn.—— But, O,</p>
<p>What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop, thou cruel,</p>
<p>Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature?</p>
<p>Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels 500 ,</p>
<p>That knew’st the very bottom of my soul,</p>
<p>That almost mightst have coined me into gold 501 ,</p>
<p>Wouldst thou have practised on 502 me for thy use 503 ?</p>
<p>May it be possible that foreign hire</p>
<p>Could out of thee extract one spark of evil</p>
<p>That might annoy 504 my finger? ’Tis so strange,</p>
<p>That though the truth of it stands off as gross 505</p>
<p>As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.</p>
<p>Treason and murder, ever kept together,</p>
<p>As two yoke-devils 506 sworn to either’s purpose,</p>
<p>Working so grossly 507 in a natural 508 cause,</p>
<p>That admiration did not whoop 509 at them.</p>
<p>But thou gainst all proportion 510 , didst bring in</p>
<p>Wonder to wait on 511 treason and on murder,</p>
<p>And whatsoever cunning fiend it was</p>
<p>That wrought 512 upon thee so preposterously 513</p>
<p>Hath got the voice 514 in hell for excellence,</p>
<p>All other devils that suggest 515 by treasons 516</p>
<p>Do botch and bungle up 517 damnation</p>
<p>With patches 518 , colours 519 and with forms 520 being fetched</p>
<p>From glist’ring 521 semblances of piety.</p>
<p>But he that tempered 522 thee, bade thee stand up 523 ,</p>
<p>Gave thee no instance 524 why thou shouldst do treason,</p>
<p>Unless to dub 525 thee with the name of traitor.</p>
<p>If that same demon that hath gulled 526 thee thus</p>
<p>Should with his lion gait 527 walk the whole world,</p>
<p>He might return to vasty Tartar 528 back,</p>
<p>And tell the legions 529 ’I can never win</p>
<p>A soul so easy 530 as that Englishman’s.’</p>
<p>O, how hast thou with jealousy 531 infected</p>
<p>The sweetness of affiance 532 ! Show 533 men dutiful?</p>
<p>Why, so didst thou. Seem they grave and learnèd?</p>
<p>Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?</p>
<p>Why, so didst thou. Seem they religious?</p>
<p>Why, so didst thou. Or are they spare 534 in diet,</p>
<p>Free from gross passion 535 or of mirth or anger,</p>
<p>Constant in spirit 536 , not swerving with the blood 537 ,</p>
<p>Garnished and decked in modest complement 538 ,</p>
<p>Not working with the eye without the ear 539 , 540</p>
<p>And but in purgèd judgement trusting neither?</p>
<p>Such and so finely bolted 541 didst thou seem:</p>
<p>And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,</p>
<p>To mark the full-fraught 542 man and best indued 543</p>
<p>With some suspicion. I will weep for thee,</p>
<p>For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like</p>
<p>Another fall of man 544 .—— Their faults are open 545 .</p>
<p>To Exeter</p>
<p>Arrest them to the answer of 546 the law,</p>
<p>And God acquit them of their practices 547 .</p>
<p>EXETER I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of 548 Richard Earl
of Cambridge.—— I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Henry Lord
Scroop of Masham.—— I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Thomas
Grey, knight, of Northumberland.</p>
<p>SCROOP Our purposes God justly hath discovered 549 ,</p>
<p>And I repent my fault more than my death,</p>
<p>Which I beseech your highness to forgive,</p>
<p>Although my body pay the price of it.</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE For me, the gold of France did not seduce,</p>
<p>Although I did admit it as a motive</p>
<p>The sooner to effect what I intended 550 .</p>
<p>But God be thankèd for prevention,</p>
<p>Which I in sufferance 551 heartily will rejoice,</p>
<p>Beseeching God and you to pardon me.</p>
<p>GREY Never did faithful subject more rejoice</p>
<p>At the discovery of most dangerous treason</p>
<p>Than I do at this hour joy o’er myself,</p>
<p>Prevented from a damnèd enterprise.</p>
<p>My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V God quit 552 you in his mercy! Hear your sentence:</p>
<p>You have conspired against our royal person,</p>
<p>Joined with an enemy proclaimed 553 and from his coffers</p>
<p>Received the golden earnest 554 of our death,</p>
<p>Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,</p>
<p>His princes and his peers to servitude,</p>
<p>His subjects to oppression and contempt</p>
<p>And his whole kingdom into desolation 555 .</p>
<p>Touching our person 556 , seek we no revenge,</p>
<p>But we our kingdom’s safety must so tender 557 ,</p>
<p>Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws</p>
<p>We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,</p>
<p>Poor miserable wretches, to your death:</p>
<p>The taste whereof, God of his mercy give</p>
<p>You patience to endure, and true repentance</p>
<p>Of all your dear 558 offences!—— Bear them hence.——</p>
<p>Exeunt [Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, guarded ]</p>
<p>Now, lords, for France: the enterprise whereof</p>
<p>Shall be to you, as us, like glorious 559 .</p>
<p>We doubt not of a fair 560 and lucky 561 war,</p>
<p>Since God so graciously hath brought to light</p>
<p>This dangerous treason lurking in our way</p>
<p>To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now</p>
<p>But every rub 562 is smoothèd on our way.</p>
<p>Then forth, dear countrymen. Let us deliver</p>
<p>Our puissance 563 into the hand of God,</p>
<p>Putting it straight in expedition 564 .</p>
<p>Cheerly 565 to sea, the signs of war advance 566 :</p>
<p>No King of England, if not King of France.</p>
<p>Flourish [Exeunt ]</p>
