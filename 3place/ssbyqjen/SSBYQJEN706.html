13</h4>
<p>Enter Worcester and Sir Richard Vernon</p>
<p>WORCESTER O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,</p>
<p>The liberal kind offer of the king.</p>
<p>VERNON ’Twere best he did.</p>
<p>WORCESTER Then we are all undone 1716 .</p>
<p>It is not possible, it cannot be,</p>
<p>The king would keep his word in loving us.</p>
<p>He will suspect us still 1717 and find a time</p>
<p>To punish this offence in other faults.</p>
<p>Supposition 1718 all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes 1719 ;</p>
<p>For treason is but trusted like the fox,</p>
<p>Who, ne’er so tame 1720 , so cherished and locked up,</p>
<p>Will have a wild trick 1721 of his ancestors.</p>
<p>Look how he can 1722 , or 1723 sad or merrily,</p>
<p>Interpretation will misquote 1724 our looks,</p>
<p>And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,</p>
<p>The better cherished, still the nearer death 1725 .</p>
<p>My nephew’s trespass 1726 may be well forgot,</p>
<p>It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,</p>
<p>And an adopted name of privilege 1727 ,</p>
<p>A hare-brained 1728 Hotspur, governed by a spleen 1729 :</p>
<p>All his offences live upon 1730 my head</p>
<p>And on his father’s. We did train 1731 him on,</p>
<p>And, his corruption being ta’en 1732 from us,</p>
<p>We as the spring 1733 of all, shall pay for all.</p>
<p>Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,</p>
<p>In any case 1734 , the offer of the king.</p>
<p>VERNON Deliver what you will, I’ll say ’tis so 1735 .</p>
<p>Here comes your cousin.</p>
<p>Enter Hotspur [and Douglas ]</p>
<p>HOTSPUR My uncle is returned.</p>
<p>Deliver up 1736 my lord of Westmorland.—</p>
<p>Uncle, what news?</p>
<p>WORCESTER The king will bid you battle 1737 presently.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS Defy him by 1738 the lord of Westmorland.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS Marry, and shall, and very willingly.</p>
<p>Exit Douglas</p>
<p>WORCESTER There is no seeming 1739 mercy in the king.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Did you beg any? God forbid!</p>
<p>WORCESTER I told him gently 1740 of our grievances,</p>
<p>Of his oath-breaking, which he mended 1741 thus,</p>
<p>By now forswearing that he is forsworn 1742 .</p>
<p>He calls us rebels, traitors, and will scourge 1743</p>
<p>With haughty arms this hateful name in us.</p>
<p>Enter Douglas</p>
<p>DOUGLAS Arm 1744 , gentlemen, to arms! For I have thrown</p>
<p>A brave defiance in King Henry’s teeth,</p>
<p>And Westmorland that was engaged 1745 did bear 1746 it,</p>
<p>Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.</p>
<p>WORCESTER The Prince of Wales stepped forth before the king,</p>
<p>And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads 1747 ,</p>
<p>And that no man might draw short breath 1748 today</p>
<p>But I and Harry Monmouth 1749 ! Tell me, tell me,</p>
<p>How showed his talking? Seemed it in contempt?</p>
<p>VERNON No, by my soul. I never in my life</p>
<p>Did hear a challenge urged 1750 more modestly,</p>
<p>Unless a brother should a brother dare</p>
<p>To gentle 1751 exercise and proof of arms 1752 .</p>
<p>He gave you all the duties of 1753 a man,</p>
<p>Trimmed up your praises 1754 with a princely tongue,</p>
<p>Spoke your deservings like a chronicle 1755 ,</p>
<p>Making you 1756 ever better than his praise</p>
<p>By still dispraising praise valued with you.</p>
<p>And, which became him like a prince indeed,</p>
<p>He made a blushing cital 1757 of himself,</p>
<p>And chid 1758 his truant 1759 youth with such a grace</p>
<p>As if he mastered there a double spirit</p>
<p>Of teaching and of learning instantly 1760 .</p>
<p>There did he pause. But let me tell the world,</p>
<p>If he outlive the envy 1761 of this day,</p>
<p>England did never owe 1762 so sweet a hope,</p>
<p>So much misconstrued in his wantonness 1763 .</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Cousin, I think thou art enamourèd</p>
<p>On 1764 his follies: never did I hear</p>
<p>Of any prince so wild a liberty 1765 .</p>
<p>But be he as he will, yet once ere night</p>
<p>I will embrace him with a soldier’s arm,</p>
<p>That he shall shrink under my courtesy 1766 .</p>
<p>Arm, arm with speed. And, fellows, soldiers, friends,</p>
<p>Better consider what you have to do</p>
<p>Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,</p>
<p>Can lift your blood up with persuasion 1767 .</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER My lord, here are letters for you.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR I cannot read them now.</p>
<p>O, gentlemen, the time of life is short!</p>
<p>To spend that shortness basely were too long,</p>
<p>If 1768 life did ride upon a dial’s point 1769 ,</p>
<p>Still ending at the arrival of an hour 1770 .</p>
<p>And if we live, we live to tread on kings,</p>
<p>If die, brave 1771 death, when princes die with us!</p>
<p>Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair 1772 ,</p>
<p>When the intent for bearing them is just.</p>
<p>Enter another Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER My lord, prepare, the king comes on apace 1773 .</p>
<p>HOTSPUR I thank him, that he cuts me 1774 from my tale,</p>
<p>For I profess not 1775 talking. Only this:</p>
<p>Let each man do his best. And here I draw a sword</p>
<p>Whose worthy temper 1776 I intend to stain</p>
<p>With the best blood that I can meet withal</p>
<p>In the adventure 1777 of this perilous day.</p>
<p>Now, Esperance ! 1778 Percy! And set on.</p>
<p>Sound all the lofty instruments 1779 of war,</p>
<p>And by that music let us all embrace,</p>
<p>For, heaven to earth 1780 , some of us never shall</p>
<p>A second time do such a courtesy.</p>
<p>They embrace [and exeunt ] 1781 . The trumpets sound. The King
entereth with his power. Alarum 1782 unto the battle. Then enter Douglas
and Sir Walter Blunt [dressed like the King 1783 ]</p>
<p>BLUNT What is thy name, that in battle thus</p>
<p>Thou crossest me? What honour dost thou seek</p>
<p>Upon my head?</p>
<p>DOUGLAS Know then, my name is Douglas,</p>
<p>And I do haunt 1784 thee in the battle thus</p>
<p>Because some tell me that thou art a king.</p>
<p>BLUNT They tell thee true.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS The Lord of Stafford dear 1785 today hath bought</p>
<p>Thy likeness 1786 , for instead of thee, King Harry,</p>
<p>This sword hath ended him. So shall it thee,</p>
<p>Unless thou yield thee as a prisoner.</p>
<p>BLUNT I was not born to yield, thou haughty Scot,</p>
<p>And thou shalt find a king that will revenge</p>
<p>Lord Stafford’s death.</p>
<p>Fight. Blunt is slain</p>
<p>Then enters Hotspur</p>
<p>HOTSPUR O Douglas, had’st thou fought at Holmedon 1787 thus,</p>
<p>I never had triumphed o’er a Scot.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS All’s done, all’s won, here breathless lies the king.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Where?</p>
<p>DOUGLAS Here.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR This, Douglas? No. I know this face full 1788 well:</p>
<p>A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt,</p>
<p>Semblably furnished 1789 like the king himself.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS Ah, fool, go with thy soul, whither it goes!</p>
<p>A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear.</p>
<p>Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?</p>
<p>HOTSPUR The king hath many marching in his coats 1790 .</p>
<p>DOUGLAS Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats 1791 .</p>
<p>I’ll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,</p>
<p>Until I meet the king.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Up, and away!</p>
<p>Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day 1792 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Alarum, and enter Falstaff, solus 1793</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Though I could scape shot-free 1794 at London, I fear the
shot here: here’s no scoring 1795 but upon the pate 1796 . Soft! Who re
you? Sir Walter Blunt. There’s honour for you! Here’s no vanity! 1797 I
am as hot as molten 1798 lead 1799 , and as heavy too; heaven keep lead
out of me! I need no more weight than mine own bowels 1800 . I have led
my ragamuffins 1801 where they are peppered 1802 : there’s not three of
my hundred and fifty left alive, and they for the town’s end 1803 , to
beg during life. But who comes here?</p>
<p>Enter the Prince</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What, stand’st thou idle here? Lend me thy sword.</p>
<p>Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff</p>
<p>Under the hoofs of vaunting 1804 enemies,</p>
<p>Whose deaths are unrevenged. Prithee</p>
<p>Lend me thy sword.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF O Hal, I prithee give me leave to breathe awhile. Turk 1805
Gregory 1806 never did such deeds in arms as I have done this day. I
have paid 1807 Percy, I have made him sure 1808 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY He is, indeed, and living to kill thee. I prithee lend
me thy sword.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Nay, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get’st not my sword; but
take my pistol, if thou wilt.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Give it me. What, is it in the case 1809 ?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Ay, Hal, ’tis hot 1810 . There’s that will sack 1811 a
city.</p>
<p>The Prince draws out 1812 a bottle of sack</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What, is it a time to jest and dally now?</p>
<p>Exit. [He ] throws it at him [as he leaves ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF If Percy be alive, I’ll pierce 1813 him. If he do come in my
way, so 1814 : if he do not, if I come in his willingly, let him make a
carbonado 1815 of me. I like not such grinning honour 1816 as Sir Walter
hath. Give me life, which if I can save, so 1817 : if not, honour comes
unlooked for 1818 , and there’s an end 1819 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
