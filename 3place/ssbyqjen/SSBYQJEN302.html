<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-13">Scene 2 / running scene 13</h4>
<p>Enter Autolycus and a Gentleman</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation 1489
?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN I was by 1490 at the opening of the fardel, heard the
old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it: whereupon, after a
little amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber 1491 . Only
this, methought I heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS I would most gladly know the issue 1492 of it.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN I make a broken delivery 1493 of the business; but
the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were very notes of
admiration 1494 . They seemed almost, with staring on one another, to
tear the cases of their eyes 1495 . There was speech in their dumbness,
language in their very gesture. They looked as 1496 they had heard of a
world ransomed, or one destroyed. A notable passion of wonder appeared
in them, but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing, could not
say if th’importance 1497 were joy or sorrow, but in the extremity of
the one 1498 , it must needs be.</p>
<p>Enter another Gentleman</p>
<p>Here comes a gentleman that happily 1499 knows more. The news,
Rogero?</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Nothing but bonfires 1500 . The oracle is fulfilled.
The king’s daughter is found. Such a deal of wonder is broken out within
this hour that ballad-makers 1501 cannot be able to express it.</p>
<p>Enter another Gentleman</p>
<p>Here comes the lady Paulina’s steward. He can deliver you more. How
goes it now, sir? This news, which is called true, is so like an old
tale that the verity 1502 of it is in strong suspicion. Has the king
found his heir?</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
circumstance 1503 . That which you hear you’ll swear you see, there is
such unity in the proofs. The mantle 1504 of Queen Hermione’s, her jewel
about the neck of it, the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
know to be his character 1505 , the majesty of the creature in
resemblance of the mother, the affection of 1506 nobleness which nature
shows above her breeding, and many other evidences proclaim her with all
certainty to be the king’s daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two
kings?</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN No.</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN Then have you lost a sight which was to be seen,
cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one joy crown another,
so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them,
for their joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up
of hands, with countenance 1507 of such distraction 1508 that they were
to be known by garment, not by favour 1509 . Our king, being ready to
leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were
now become a loss, cries ‘O, thy mother, thy mother!’ Then asks Bohemia
forgiveness, then embraces his son-in-law, then again worries he 1510
his daughter with clipping 1511 her. Now he thanks the old shepherd,
which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings’ reigns 1512
. I never heard of such another encounter, which lames report to follow
it 1513 and undoes 1514 description to do 1515 it.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
hence the child?</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN Like an old tale still, which will have matter to
rehearse 1516 , though credit 1517 be asleep and not an ear open: he was
torn to pieces with 1518 a bear. This avouches 1519 the shepherd’s son,
who has not only his innocence 1520 , which seems much, to justify him,
but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN What became of his bark 1521 and his followers?</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN Wrecked the same instant of their master’s death and
in the view of the shepherd, so that all the instruments which aided to
expose the child were even then lost when it was found. But, O, the
noble combat that ’twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had
one eye declined for the loss of her husband, another elevated 1522 that
the oracle was fulfilled. She lifted the princess from the earth, and so
locks her in embracing, as if she would pin her to her heart that she
might no more be in danger of losing 1523 .</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
kings and princes, for by such was it acted.</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN One of the prettiest touches 1524 of all and that
which angled for mine eyes, caught the water 1525 though not the fish,
was when, at the relation of the queen’s death, with the manner how she
came to’t bravely confessed and lamented by the king, how attentiveness
1526 wounded his daughter, till, from one sign of dolour 1527 to
another, she did, with an ‘Alas’, I would fain 1528 say, bleed tears,
for I am sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble 1529 there
changed colour, some swooned, all sorrowed. If all the world could have
seen’t, the woe had been universal.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Are they returned to the court?</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN No. The princess hearing of her mother’s statue,
which is in the keeping of Paulina — a piece many years in doing and now
newly performed 1530 by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano 1531 ,
who, had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work, would
beguile 1532 nature of her custom 1533 , so perfectly he is her ape 1534
. He so near to Hermione hath done 1535 Hermione that they say one would
speak to her and stand in hope of answer. Thither with all greediness of
affection are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN I thought she had some great matter there in hand,
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of
Hermione visited that removèd 1536 house. Shall we thither and with our
company piece 1537 the rejoicing?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Who would be thence 1538 that has the benefit of
access? Every wink of an eye some new grace 1539 will be born. Our
absence makes us unthrifty 1540 to our knowledge. Let’s along.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Gentlemen ]</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Now, had I not the dash 1541 of my former life in me, would
preferment 1542 drop on my head. I brought the 1543 old man and his son
aboard the prince; told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not
what. But he at that time, overfond of the shepherd’s daughter, so he
then took her to be, who began to be much seasick, and himself little
better, extremity of weather continuing, this mystery remained
undiscovered. But ’tis all one to me, for had I been the finder out of
this secret, it would not have relished 1544 among my other discredits
1545 .</p>
<p>Enter Shepherd and Clown</p>
<p>Here come those I have done good to against my will, and already
appearing in the blossoms 1546 of their fortune.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Come, boy. I am past more children, but thy sons and
daughters will be all gentlemen born.</p>
<p>CLOWN You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me this 1547
other day, because I was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say
you see them not and think me still no gentleman born. You were best say
these robes are not gentlemen born. Give me the lie 1548 , do, and try
1549 whether I am not now a gentleman born.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.</p>
<p>CLOWN Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD And so have I, boy.</p>
<p>CLOWN So you have, but I was a gentleman born before my father, for
the king’s son took me by the hand, and called me brother, and then the
two kings called my father brother, and then the prince my brother and
the princess my sister called my father father; and so we wept, and
there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD We may live, son, to shed many more.</p>
<p>CLOWN Ay, or else ’twere hard luck, being in so preposterous 1550
estate as we are.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the faults I
have committed to your worship and to give me your good report 1551 to
the prince my master.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Prithee, son, do, for we must be gentle 1552 , now we are
gentlemen.</p>
<p>CLOWN Thou wilt amend thy life?</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Ay, an it like your good worship.</p>
<p>CLOWN Give me thy hand. I will swear to the prince thou art as honest
a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD You may say it, but not swear it.</p>
<p>CLOWN Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors 1553 and
franklins 1554 say it, I’ll swear it.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD How if it be false, son?</p>
<p>CLOWN If it be ne’er so false 1555 , a true gentleman may swear it in
1556 the behalf of his friend, and I’ll swear to the prince thou art a
tall fellow of thy hands 1557 and that thou wilt not be drunk. But I
know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk.
But I’ll swear it, and I would 1558 thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy
hands.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS I will prove so, sir, to my 1559 power.</p>
<p>CLOWN Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow. If I do not wonder how
thou dar’st venture to be drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust me not.
Hark, the kings and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
queen’s picture 1560 . Come, follow us. We’ll be thy good masters.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
