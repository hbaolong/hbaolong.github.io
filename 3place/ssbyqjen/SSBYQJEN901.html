<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-13">Scene 2 ／ running scene 13</h4>
<p>Enter Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury</p>
<p>CRANMER I hope I am not too late, and yet the gentleman</p>
<p>That was sent to me from the council prayed me</p>
<p>To make great haste. All fast 1432 ? What means this? Ho!</p>
<p>Who waits there?</p>
<p>Enter [Door ] Keeper</p>
<p>Sure 1433 you know me?</p>
<p>KEEPER Yes, my lord,</p>
<p>But yet I cannot help you.</p>
<p>CRANMER Why?</p>
<p>KEEPER Your grace must wait till you be called for.</p>
<p>Enter Doctor Butts [passing over the stage ]</p>
<p>CRANMER So 1434 .</p>
<p>DOCTOR BUTTS This is a piece of malice. I am glad</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>I came this way so happily 1435 . The king</p>
<p>Shall understand it presently 1436 .</p>
<p>Exit [Doctor ] Butts</p>
<p>CRANMER ’Tis Butts,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>The king’s physician: as he passed along</p>
<p>How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me:</p>
<p>Pray heaven he sound 1437 not my disgrace: for certain</p>
<p>This is of purpose laid 1438 by some that hate me —</p>
<p>God turn 1439 their hearts, I never sought their malice —</p>
<p>To quench mine honour: they would shame to make me</p>
<p>Wait else at door, a fellow councillor,</p>
<p>’Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasures</p>
<p>Must be fulfilled, and I attend 1440 with patience.</p>
<p>Enter the King [Henry ] and [Doctor ] Butts at a window above
1441</p>
<p>DOCTOR BUTTS I’ll show your grace the strangest sight—</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII What’s that, Butts?</p>
<p>DOCTOR BUTTS I think your highness saw this many a day.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Body o’me 1442 , where is it?</p>
<p>DOCTOR BUTTS There, my lord:</p>
<p>The high promotion of his grace of Canterbury,</p>
<p>Who holds his state 1443 at door, ’mongst pursuivants 1444 ,</p>
<p>Pages, and footboys 1445 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Ha? ’Tis he, indeed.</p>
<p>Is this the honour they do one another?</p>
<p>’Tis well there’s one above ’em 1446 yet: I had thought</p>
<p>They had parted 1447 so much honesty 1448 among ’em —</p>
<p>At least good manners — as not thus to suffer 1449</p>
<p>A man of his place 1450 , and so near our favour,</p>
<p>To dance attendance 1451 on their lordships’ pleasures —</p>
<p>And at the door, too, like a post 1452 with packets 1453 .</p>
<p>By holy Mary, Butts, there’s knavery:</p>
<p>Let ’em alone, and draw the curtain close 1454 :</p>
<p>We shall hear more anon.</p>
<p>[Exeunt above ]</p>
<p>A council table brought in with chairs and stools, and placed under
the state 1455 . Enter Lord Chancellor, places himself at the upper end
of the table, on the left hand: a seat being left void above 1456 him,
as for Canterbury’s seat. Duke of Suffolk, Duke of Norfolk, Surrey, Lord
Chamberlain, Gardiner, seat themselves in order on each side. Cromwell
at lower end, as secretary</p>
<p>CHANCELLOR Speak to the business, master secretary:</p>
<p>To Cromwell</p>
<p>Why are we met in council?</p>
<p>CROMWELL Please your honours,</p>
<p>The chief cause concerns his grace of Canterbury.</p>
<p>GARDINER Has he had knowledge of it?</p>
<p>CROMWELL Yes.</p>
<p>NORFOLK Who waits there?</p>
<p>KEEPER Without 1457 , my noble lords?</p>
<p>GARDINER Yes.</p>
<p>KEEPER My lord archbishop:</p>
<p>And has done half an hour to know your pleasures.</p>
<p>CHANCELLOR Let him come in.</p>
<p>KEEPER Your grace may enter now.</p>
<p>Cranmer [enters below and ] approaches the council table</p>
<p>CHANCELLOR My good lord archbishop, I’m very sorry</p>
<p>To sit here at this present 1458 , and behold</p>
<p>That chair 1459 stand empty: but we all are men,</p>
<p>In our own natures frail, and capable</p>
<p>Of 1460 our flesh 1461 : few are angels: out of which frailty</p>
<p>And want 1462 of wisdom, you that best should teach us,</p>
<p>Have misdemeaned yourself 1463 , and not a little:</p>
<p>Toward the king first, then his laws, in filling</p>
<p>The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains —</p>
<p>For so we are informed — with new opinions,</p>
<p>Divers 1464 and dangerous, which are heresies 1465 ,</p>
<p>And, not reformed, may prove pernicious 1466 .</p>
<p>GARDINER Which reformation must be sudden too,</p>
<p>My noble lords, for those that tame wild horses</p>
<p>Pace ’em not in their hands 1467 to make ’em gentle,</p>
<p>But stop their mouths with stubborn 1468 bits and spur ’em</p>
<p>Till they obey the manage 1469 . If we suffer 1470 ,</p>
<p>Out of our easiness 1471 and childish pity</p>
<p>To one man’s honour, this contagious sickness,</p>
<p>Farewell all physic 1472 : and what follows then?</p>
<p>Commotions, uproars, with a general taint 1473</p>
<p>Of the whole state, as of late days our neighbours,</p>
<p>The upper Germany, can dearly witness 1474 ,</p>
<p>Yet freshly pitied in our memories.</p>
<p>CRANMER My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress</p>
<p>Both of my life and office, I have laboured,</p>
<p>And with no little study, that my teaching</p>
<p>And the strong course 1475 of my authority</p>
<p>Might go one way, and safely: and the end</p>
<p>Was ever to do well: nor is there living —</p>
<p>I speak it with a single 1476 heart, my lords —</p>
<p>A man that more detests, more stirs against,</p>
<p>Both in his private conscience and his place 1477 ,</p>
<p>Defacers of a public peace than I do:</p>
<p>Pray heaven the king may never find a heart</p>
<p>With less allegiance in it. Men that make</p>
<p>Envy and crooked malice nourishment</p>
<p>Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships</p>
<p>That in this case of justice, my accusers,</p>
<p>Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,</p>
<p>And freely urge 1478 against me.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Nay, my lord,</p>
<p>That cannot be: you are a councillor,</p>
<p>And by that virtue 1479 no man dare accuse you.</p>
<p>GARDINER My lord, because we have business of more moment 1480 ,</p>
<p>We will be short 1481 with you. ‘Tis his highness’ pleasure</p>
<p>And our consent, for better trial of you,</p>
<p>From hence you be committed to the Tower,</p>
<p>Where being but a private 1482 man again,</p>
<p>You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,</p>
<p>More than, I fear, you are provided 1483 for.</p>
<p>CRANMER Ah, my good lord of Winchester, I thank you:</p>
<p>You are always my good friend: if your will pass 1484 ,</p>
<p>I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,</p>
<p>You are so merciful. I see your end 1485 :</p>
<p>’Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,</p>
<p>Become 1486 a churchman better than ambition:</p>
<p>Win straying souls with modesty again:</p>
<p>Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,</p>
<p>Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,</p>
<p>I make as little doubt 1487 as you do conscience 1488</p>
<p>In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,</p>
<p>But reverence to your calling makes me modest.</p>
<p>GARDINER My lord, my lord, you are a sectary 1489 ,</p>
<p>That’s the plain truth: your painted 1490 gloss discovers 1491</p>
<p>To men that understand you words 1492 and weakness.</p>
<p>CROMWELL My lord of Winchester, you’re a little,</p>
<p>By your good favour 1493 , too sharp: men so noble,</p>
<p>However faulty, yet should find respect</p>
<p>For what they have been: ’tis a cruelty</p>
<p>To load a falling man.</p>
<p>GARDINER Good Master Secretary,</p>
<p>I cry your honour mercy 1494 : you may worst 1495</p>
<p>Of all this table say so.</p>
<p>CROMWELL Why, my lord?</p>
<p>GARDINER Do not I know you for a favourer</p>
<p>Of this new sect? Ye are not sound 1496 .</p>
<p>CROMWELL Not sound?</p>
<p>GARDINER Not sound, I say.</p>
<p>CROMWELL Would you were half so honest:</p>
<p>Men’s prayers then would seek you, not their fears.</p>
<p>GARDINER I shall remember this bold 1497 language.</p>
<p>CROMWELL Do.</p>
<p>Remember your bold life, too.</p>
<p>CHANCELLOR This is too much:</p>
<p>Forbear 1498 for shame, my lords.</p>
<p>GARDINER I have done.</p>
<p>CROMWELL And I.</p>
<p>CHANCELLOR Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,</p>
<p>To Cranmer</p>
<p>I take it, by all voices, that forthwith</p>
<p>You be conveyed to th’Tower a prisoner,</p>
<p>There to remain till the king’s further pleasure</p>
<p>Be known unto us: are you all agreed, lords?</p>
<p>ALL We are.</p>
<p>CRANMER Is there no other way of mercy,</p>
<p>But I must needs to th’Tower, my lords?</p>
<p>GARDINER What other</p>
<p>Would you expect? You are strangely troublesome:</p>
<p>Let some o’th’guard be ready there.</p>
<p>Enter the Guard</p>
<p>CRANMER For me?</p>
<p>Must I go like a traitor thither?</p>
<p>GARDINER Receive 1499 him,</p>
<p>To the Guard</p>
<p>And see him safe 1500 i’th’Tower.</p>
<p>CRANMER Stay, good my lords,</p>
<p>I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords,</p>
<p>He shows the King’s ring</p>
<p>By virtue of that ring, I take my cause</p>
<p>Out of the gripes 1501 of cruel men, and give it</p>
<p>To a most noble judge, the king my master.</p>
<p>CHAMBERLAIN 1502 This is the king’s ring.</p>
<p>SURREY ’Tis no counterfeit.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK ’Tis the right ring, by heaven: I told ye all,</p>
<p>When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,</p>
<p>’Twould fall upon ourselves.</p>
<p>NORFOLK Do you think, my lords,</p>
<p>The king will suffer but the little finger</p>
<p>Of this man to be vexed?</p>
<p>CHAMBERLAIN ’Tis now too certain:</p>
<p>How much more is his life in value with him 1503 ?</p>
<p>Would I were fairly out on’t 1504 .</p>
<p>CROMWELL My mind gave 1505 me,</p>
<p>In seeking tales and informations 1506</p>
<p>Against this man, whose honesty the devil</p>
<p>And his disciples only envy at,</p>
<p>Ye blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!</p>
<p>Enter King [Henry ] frowning on them: takes his seat 1507</p>
<p>GARDINER Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven</p>
<p>In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince,</p>
<p>Not only good and wise, but most religious:</p>
<p>One that, in all obedience, makes the Church</p>
<p>The chief aim 1508 of his honour and, to strengthen</p>
<p>That holy duty out of dear respect 1509 ,</p>
<p>His royal self in judgement comes to hear</p>
<p>The cause betwixt her and this great offender.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII You were ever good at sudden 1510 commendations,</p>
<p>Bishop of Winchester. But know I come not</p>
<p>To hear such flattery now, and in my presence</p>
<p>They 1511 are too thin and base to hide offences:</p>
<p>To me you cannot reach. You play the spaniel,</p>
<p>And think with wagging of your tongue to win me:</p>
<p>But whatsoe’er thou tak’st me for, I’m sure</p>
<p>Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody 1512 .—</p>
<p>Good man, sit down.— Now let me see the proudest</p>
<p>To Cranmer, who sits in</p>
<p>He 1513 , that dares most, but wag his finger at thee.</p>
<p>vacant seat at head of table</p>
<p>By all that’s holy, he had better starve 1514</p>
<p>Than but once think his place becomes thee not.</p>
<p>SURREY May it please your grace—</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII No, sir, it does not please me.</p>
<p>I had thought I had had men of some understanding</p>
<p>And wisdom of my council, but I find none.</p>
<p>Was it discretion 1515 , lords, to let this man,</p>
<p>This good man — few of you deserve that title —</p>
<p>This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy</p>
<p>At chamber door? And one as great as you are?</p>
<p>Why, what a shame was this? Did my commission</p>
<p>Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye</p>
<p>Power as he was a councillor to try 1516 him,</p>
<p>Not as a groom. There’s some of ye, I see,</p>
<p>More out of malice than integrity,</p>
<p>Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean 1517 ,</p>
<p>Which ye shall never have while I live.</p>
<p>CHANCELLOR Thus far,</p>
<p>My most dread sovereign, may it like 1518 your grace</p>
<p>To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed 1519</p>
<p>Concerning his imprisonment, was rather —</p>
<p>If there be faith in men — meant for his trial,</p>
<p>And fair purgation 1520 to the world than malice,</p>
<p>I’m sure, in me.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Well, well, my lords, respect him:</p>
<p>Take him, and use 1521 him well: he’s worthy of it.</p>
<p>I will say thus much for him: if a prince</p>
<p>May be beholding to a subject, I</p>
<p>Am for his love and service so to him.</p>
<p>Make me no more ado 1522 , but all embrace him:</p>
<p>Be friends, for shame, my lords.— My lord of Canterbury,</p>
<p>To Cranmer</p>
<p>I have a suit which you must not deny me:</p>
<p>That is, a fair young maid that yet wants 1523 baptism:</p>
<p>You must be godfather, and answer for her.</p>
<p>CRANMER The greatest monarch now alive may glory</p>
<p>In such an honour: how may I deserve it</p>
<p>That am a poor and humble subject to you?</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Come, come, my lord, you’d spare your spoons 1524 :
you shall have two noble partners with you: the old Duchess of Norfolk,
and Lady Marquess Dorset: will these please you?</p>
<p>Once more, my lord of Winchester, I charge you</p>
<p>To Gardiner</p>
<p>Embrace and love this man.</p>
<p>GARDINER With a true heart</p>
<p>He embraces Cranmer</p>
<p>And brother-love I do it.</p>
<p>CRANMER And let heaven</p>
<p>He weeps</p>
<p>Witness how dear I hold this confirmation.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:</p>
<p>The common voice 1525 , I see, is verified</p>
<p>Of thee, which says thus: ’Do my lord of Canterbury</p>
<p>A shrewd 1526 turn, and he’s your friend for ever.’</p>
<p>Come, lords, we trifle time away: I long</p>
<p>To have this young one 1527 made a Christian.</p>
<p>As I have made ye one, lords, one remain:</p>
<p>So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
