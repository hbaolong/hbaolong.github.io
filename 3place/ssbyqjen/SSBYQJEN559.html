continues</h4>
<p>Enter Othello and Iago</p>
<p>IAGO Will you think so?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Think so, Iago?</p>
<p>IAGO What, to kiss in private?</p>
<p>OTHELLO An unauthorized kiss!</p>
<p>IAGO Or to be naked with her friend in bed</p>
<p>An hour or more, not meaning any harm?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?</p>
<p>It is hypocrisy against the devil 1281 :</p>
<p>They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,</p>
<p>The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.</p>
<p>IAGO If they do nothing, ’tis a venial 1282 slip:</p>
<p>But if I give my wife a handkerchief—</p>
<p>OTHELLO What then?</p>
<p>IAGO Why, then, ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers,</p>
<p>She may, I think, bestow’t on any man.</p>
<p>OTHELLO She is protectress of her honour too:</p>
<p>May she give that?</p>
<p>IAGO Her honour is an essence that’s not seen:</p>
<p>They have it very oft that have it not 1283 .</p>
<p>But, for the handkerchief—</p>
<p>OTHELLO By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.</p>
<p>Thou said’st — O, it comes o’er my memory</p>
<p>As doth the raven 1284 o’er the infectious 1285 house,</p>
<p>Boding 1286 to all — he had my handkerchief.</p>
<p>IAGO Ay, what of that?</p>
<p>OTHELLO That’s not so good now.</p>
<p>IAGO What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong?</p>
<p>Or heard him say — as knaves be such abroad 1287 ,</p>
<p>Who having by their own importunate 1288 suit,</p>
<p>Or voluntary dotage 1289 of some mistress,</p>
<p>Convincèd 1290 or supplied 1291 them, cannot choose</p>
<p>But they must blab—</p>
<p>OTHELLO Hath he said anything?</p>
<p>IAGO He hath, my lord, but be you well assured,</p>
<p>No more than he’ll unswear.</p>
<p>OTHELLO What hath he said?</p>
<p>IAGO Why, that he did 1292 : I know not what he did.</p>
<p>OTHELLO What? What?</p>
<p>IAGO Lie—</p>
<p>OTHELLO With her?</p>
<p>IAGO With her? On her: what you will.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Lie with her? Lie on 1293 her? We say ‘Lie on her’ when they
belie 1294 her. Lie with her! That’s fulsome 1295 : handkerchief —
confessions — handkerchief! To confess and be hanged for his labour:
first to be hanged and then to confess: I tremble at it. Nature would
not invest 1296 herself in such shadowing 1297 passion without some
instruction 1298 1299 . It is not words that shakes me thus. Pish! Noses
1300 , ears and lips 1301 . Is’t possible? Confess? Handkerchief? O
devil!</p>
<p>Falls in a trance</p>
<p>IAGO Work on,</p>
<p>My medicine 1302 works! Thus credulous fools are caught,</p>
<p>And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,</p>
<p>All guiltless, meet reproach 1303 .— What, ho? My lord?</p>
<p>My lord, I say! Othello!—</p>
<p>Enter Cassio</p>
<p>How now, Cassio?</p>
<p>CASSIO What’s the matter?</p>
<p>IAGO My lord is fall’n into an epilepsy.</p>
<p>This is his second fit: he had one yesterday.</p>
<p>CASSIO Rub him about the temples.</p>
<p>IAGO The lethargy 1304 must have his quiet course:</p>
<p>If not, he foams at mouth and by and by</p>
<p>Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:</p>
<p>Do you withdraw yourself a little while,</p>
<p>He will recover straight. When he is gone,</p>
<p>I would on great occasion 1305 speak with you.</p>
<p>[Exit Cassio ]</p>
<p>How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Dost thou mock me? 1306</p>
<p>IAGO I mock you not, by heaven.</p>
<p>Would you would bear your fortune like a man!</p>
<p>OTHELLO A hornèd 1307 man’s a monster and a beast.</p>
<p>IAGO There’s many a beast then in a populous city,</p>
<p>And many a civil 1308 monster.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Did he confess it?</p>
<p>IAGO Good sir, be a man.</p>
<p>Think every bearded 1309 fellow that’s but yoked 1310</p>
<p>May draw 1311 with you: there’s millions now alive</p>
<p>That nightly lie in those unproper 1312 beds</p>
<p>Which they dare swear peculiar 1313 : your case is better.</p>
<p>O, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock,</p>
<p>To lip 1314 a wanton 1315 in a secure couch 1316</p>
<p>And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,</p>
<p>And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.</p>
<p>OTHELLO O, thou art wise: ’tis certain.</p>
<p>IAGO Stand you awhile apart,</p>
<p>Confine yourself but in a patient list 1317 .</p>
<p>Whilst you were here o’erwhelmèd with your grief —</p>
<p>A passion most unsuiting such a man —</p>
<p>Cassio came hither: I shifted him away 1318 ,</p>
<p>And laid good’scuses upon your ecstasy 1319 ,</p>
<p>Bade him anon 1320 return and here speak with me,</p>
<p>The which he promised. Do but encave 1321 yourself</p>
<p>And mark the fleers 1322 , the gibes and notable scorns</p>
<p>That dwell in every region of his face,</p>
<p>For I will make him tell the tale anew,</p>
<p>Where, how, how oft, how long ago and when</p>
<p>He hath and is again to cope 1323 your wife.</p>
<p>I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,</p>
<p>Or I shall say you’re all in all in spleen 1324 ,</p>
<p>And nothing of a man.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Dost thou hear, Iago?</p>
<p>I will be found most cunning in my patience,</p>
<p>But — dost thou hear? — most bloody.</p>
<p>IAGO That’s not amiss,</p>
<p>But yet keep time 1325 in all. Will you withdraw?</p>
<p>Othello withdraws</p>
<p>Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,</p>
<p>A housewife 1326 that by selling her desires</p>
<p>Buys herself bread and cloth: it is a creature</p>
<p>That dotes on Cassio — as’tis the strumpet 1327 ’s plague</p>
<p>To beguile 1328 many and be beguiled 1329 by one.</p>
<p>He, when he hears of her, cannot restrain 1330</p>
<p>From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.</p>
<p>Enter Cassio</p>
<p>As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad,</p>
<p>And his unbookish 1331 jealousy must conster 1332</p>
<p>Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures and light 1333 behaviours</p>
<p>Quite in the wrong.— How do you, lieutenant?</p>
<p>CASSIO The worser that you give me the addition 1334</p>
<p>Whose want 1335 even kills me.</p>
<p>IAGO Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on’t 1336 .</p>
<p>Lowers his voice</p>
<p>Now, if this suit lay in Bianca’s power,</p>
<p>How quickly should you speed 1337 !</p>
<p>CASSIO Alas, poor caitiff 1338 !</p>
<p>He laughs</p>
<p>OTHELLO Look how he laughs already!</p>
<p>IAGO I never knew woman love man so.</p>
<p>CASSIO Alas, poor rogue, I think, indeed, she loves me.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Now he denies it faintly 1339 , and laughs it out.</p>
<p>IAGO Do you hear, Cassio?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Now he importunes him</p>
<p>To tell it o’er: go to, well said 1340 , well said.</p>
<p>IAGO She gives it out that you shall marry her:</p>
<p>Do you intend it?</p>
<p>CASSIO Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>OTHELLO Do ye triumph 1341 , Roman? Do you triumph?</p>
<p>CASSIO I marry? What? A customer? 1342 Prithee bear some charity to
my wit 1343 : do not think it so unwholesome 1344 . Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>OTHELLO So, so, so, so: they laugh that wins.</p>
<p>IAGO Why, the cry 1345 goes that you marry her.</p>
<p>CASSIO Prithee say true.</p>
<p>IAGO I am a very villain else 1346 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO Have you scored me 1347 ? Well.</p>
<p>CASSIO This is the monkey’s own giving out: she is persuaded I will
marry her, out of her own love and flattery 1348 , not out of my
promise.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Iago beckons me: now he begins the story.</p>
<p>CASSIO She was here even now: she haunts 1349 me in every place. I
was the other day talking on the sea-bank 1350 with certain Venetians,
and thither comes the bauble 1351 , and falls me 1352 thus about my
neck—</p>
<p>Embraces him</p>
<p>OTHELLO Crying, ‘O dear Cassio!’ as it were: his gesture imports 1353
it.</p>
<p>CASSIO So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me, so shakes and pulls me.
Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>OTHELLO Now he tells how she plucked 1354 him to my chamber. O, I see
that nose 1355 of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.</p>
<p>CASSIO Well, I must leave her company.</p>
<p>IAGO Before me, look where she comes.</p>
<p>Enter Bianca</p>
<p>CASSIO ’Tis such another 1356 fitchew 1357 ! Marry, a perfumed one!—
What do you mean by this haunting of me?</p>
<p>BIANCA Let the devil and his dam 1358 haunt you! What did you mean by
that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take
it. I must take out the work? A likely piece of work 1359 , that you
should find it in your chamber and know not who left it there. This is
some minx 1360 ’s token, and I must take out the work? There, give it
your hobby-horse 1361 : wheresoever you had it, I’ll take out no work
on’t.</p>
<p>She gives him</p>
<p>the handkerchier</p>
<p>CASSIO How now, my sweet Bianca? How now? How now?</p>
<p>OTHELLO By heaven, that should 1362 be my handkerchief!</p>
<p>BIANCA If you’ll come to supper 1363 tonight, you may: if you will
not, come when you are next prepared for.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>IAGO After her, after her.</p>
<p>CASSIO I must: she’ll rail 1364 in the streets else.</p>
<p>IAGO Will you sup there?</p>
<p>CASSIO Yes, I intend so.</p>
<p>IAGO Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak with
you.</p>
<p>CASSIO Prithee come. Will you?</p>
<p>IAGO Go to: say no more.</p>
<p>[Exit Cassio ]</p>
<p>OTHELLO How shall I murder him, Iago?</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>IAGO Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?</p>
<p>OTHELLO O, Iago!</p>
<p>IAGO And did you see the handkerchief?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Was that mine?</p>
<p>IAGO Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the foolish 1365
woman your wife! She gave it him, and he hath giv’n it his whore.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I would have him nine years a-killing. A fine woman! A fair
woman! A sweet woman!</p>
<p>IAGO Nay, you must forget that.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ay, let her rot and perish, and be damned tonight, for she
shall not live. No, my heart is turned to stone: I strike it, and it
hurts my hand. O, the world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie
by an emperor’s side and command him tasks.</p>
<p>IAGO Nay, that’s not your way 1366 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate with her
needle, an admirable musician. O, she will sing the savageness out of a
bear. Of so high and plenteous wit and invention 1367 !</p>
<p>IAGO She’s the worse for all this.</p>
<p>OTHELLO O, a thousand, a thousand times! And then, of so gentle a
condition 1368 !</p>
<p>IAGO Ay, too gentle 1369 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO Nay, that’s certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago! O, Iago,
the pity of it, Iago!</p>
<p>IAGO If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent 1370 to
offend, for if it touch 1371 not you, it comes near nobody.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I will chop her into messes 1372 . Cuckold me?</p>
<p>IAGO O, ’tis foul in her.</p>
<p>OTHELLO With mine officer?</p>
<p>IAGO That’s fouler.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Get me some poison, Iago, this night: I’ll not expostulate
1373 with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide 1374 my mind again:
this night, Iago.</p>
<p>IAGO Do it not with poison: strangle her in her bed, even the bed she
hath contaminated.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Good, good: the justice of it pleases. Very good.</p>
<p>IAGO And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker 1375 : you shall hear
more by midnight.</p>
<p>Enter Lodovico, Desdemona and Attendants</p>
<p>OTHELLO Excellent good.</p>
<p>A trumpet within</p>
<p>What trumpet is that same?</p>
<p>IAGO I warrant something from Venice.</p>
<p>’Tis Lodovico: this comes from the duke.</p>
<p>See, your wife’s with him.</p>
<p>LODOVICO Save you, worthy general!</p>
<p>OTHELLO With all my heart, sir.</p>
<p>LODOVICO The duke and the senators of Venice greet you.</p>
<p>Gives a letter</p>
<p>OTHELLO I kiss the instrument of their pleasures 1376 .</p>
<p>Opens letter and reads</p>
<p>DESDEMONA And what’s the news, good cousin 1377 Lodovico?</p>
<p>IAGO I am very glad to see you, signior.</p>
<p>Welcome to Cyprus.</p>
<p>LODOVICO I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?</p>
<p>IAGO Lives, sir.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Cousin, there’s fall’n between him and my lord</p>
<p>An unkind breach 1378 : but you shall make all well.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Are you sure of that?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA My lord?</p>
<p>OTHELLO ‘This fail you not to do, as you will—’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>LODOVICO He did not call: he’s busy in the paper.</p>
<p>Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA A most unhappy one: I would do much</p>
<p>T’atone 1379 them, for the love I bear to Cassio.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Fire and brimstone!</p>
<p>DESDEMONA My lord?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Are you wise 1380 ?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA What? Is he angry?</p>
<p>LODOVICO Maybe th’letter moved him,</p>
<p>For, as I think, they do command him home,</p>
<p>Deputing Cassio in his government.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Trust me, I am glad on’t 1381 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO Indeed?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA My lord?</p>
<p>OTHELLO I am glad to see you mad 1382 .</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Why, sweet Othello?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Devil!</p>
<p>Strikes her</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I have not deserved this.</p>
<p>LODOVICO My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,</p>
<p>Though I should swear I saw’t. ’Tis very much 1383 :</p>
<p>Make her amends, she weeps.</p>
<p>OTHELLO O devil, devil!</p>
<p>If that the earth could teem 1384 with woman’s tears,</p>
<p>Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile 1385 .—</p>
<p>Out of my sight!</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I will not stay to offend you.</p>
<p>Starts to leave</p>
<p>LODOVICO Truly, an obedient lady:</p>
<p>I do beseech your lordship, call her back.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Mistress!</p>
<p>DESDEMONA My lord?</p>
<p>Returns</p>
<p>OTHELLO What would you with her, sir?</p>
<p>LODOVICO Who, I, my lord?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn 1386 :</p>
<p>Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on 1387</p>
<p>And turn again: and she can weep, sir, weep:</p>
<p>And she’s obedient 1388 , as you say, obedient:</p>
<p>Very obedient.— Proceed you in your tears.—</p>
<p>Concerning this, sir, — O well-painted passion 1389 ! —</p>
<p>I am commanded home.— Get you away:</p>
<p>I’ll send for you anon.— Sir, I obey the mandate,</p>
<p>And will return to Venice.— Hence, avaunt!</p>
<p>[Exit Desdemona ]</p>
<p>Cassio shall have my place 1390 . And, sir, tonight</p>
<p>I do entreat that we may sup together:</p>
<p>You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.— Goats and monkeys 1391 !</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>LODOVICO Is this the noble Moor whom our full 1392 senate</p>
<p>Call all in all sufficient 1393 ? Is this the nature</p>
<p>Whom passion could not shake? Whose solid virtue</p>
<p>The shot of accident nor dart of chance</p>
<p>Could neither graze nor pierce?</p>
<p>IAGO He is much changed.</p>
<p>LODOVICO Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?</p>
<p>IAGO He’s that he is: I may not breathe my censure 1394</p>
<p>What he might be: if what he might he is not,</p>
<p>I would to heaven he were 1395 !</p>
<p>LODOVICO What, strike his wife?</p>
<p>IAGO Faith, that was not so well 1396 , yet would 1397 I knew</p>
<p>That stroke would prove the worst!</p>
<p>LODOVICO Is it his use 1398 ?</p>
<p>Or did the letters work upon his blood</p>
<p>And new-create his fault?</p>
<p>IAGO Alas, alas!</p>
<p>It is not honesty in me to speak</p>
<p>What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,</p>
<p>And his own courses will denote 1399 him so</p>
<p>That I may save my speech: do but go after,</p>
<p>And mark how he continues.</p>
<p>LODOVICO I am sorry that I am deceived in him.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
