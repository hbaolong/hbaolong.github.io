<h4 id="scene-1-1-running-scene-1">Scene 1 1 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter Kent, Gloucester and Edmund</p>
<p>KENT I thought the king had more affected 2 the Duke of Albany than
Cornwall.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER It did always seem so to us: but now in the division of
the kingdom it appears not which of the dukes he values most, for
qualities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of
either’s moiety 3 .</p>
<p>KENT Is not this your son, my lord?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER His breeding 4 , sir, hath been at my charge 5 . I have so
often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am brazed 6 to’t.</p>
<p>KENT I cannot conceive 7 you.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Sir, this young fellow’s mother could; whereupon she grew
round-wombed and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere 8 she had a
husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault 9 ?</p>
<p>KENT I cannot wish the fault undone 10 , the issue 11 of it being so
proper 12 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER But I have a son, sir, by order of law 13 , some year 14
elder than this, who yet is no dearer 15 in my account 16 , though this
knave came something saucily to the world before he was sent for: yet
was his mother fair, there was good sport at his making and the whoreson
17 must be acknowledged.— Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?</p>
<p>EDMUND No, my lord.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable
friend.</p>
<p>EDMUND My services to your lordship.</p>
<p>KENT I must love you, and sue 18 to know you better.</p>
<p>EDMUND Sir, I shall study deserving 19 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER He hath been out 20 nine years, and away he shall again.
The king is coming.</p>
<p>Sennet 21 . Enter [one bearing a coronet 22 , then ] King Lear,
Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia and Attendants</p>
<p>LEAR Attend 23 the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER I shall, my lord.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>LEAR Meantime we shall express our darker 24 purpose.</p>
<p>Give me the map there.</p>
<p>Kent or an Attendant gives Lear a map</p>
<p>Know that we have divided</p>
<p>In three our kingdom, and ’tis our fast intent 25</p>
<p>To shake all cares and business 26 from our age,</p>
<p>Conferring them on younger strengths while we</p>
<p>Unburdened crawl toward death. Our son 27 of Cornwall,</p>
<p>And you our no less loving son of Albany,</p>
<p>We have this hour a constant will 28 to publish 29</p>
<p>Our daughters’ several dowers 30 , that 31 future strife</p>
<p>May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,</p>
<p>Great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love,</p>
<p>Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn 32</p>
<p>And here are to be answered. Tell me, my daughters —</p>
<p>Since now we will divest us both of rule,</p>
<p>Interest 33 of territory, cares of state —</p>
<p>Which of you shall we say doth love us most,</p>
<p>That we our largest bounty 34 may extend</p>
<p>Where nature doth with merit challenge 35 ? Goneril,</p>
<p>Our eldest born, speak first.</p>
<p>GONERIL Sir, I love you more than word can wield 36 the matter,</p>
<p>Dearer than eyesight, space and liberty,</p>
<p>Beyond what can be valued rich or rare,</p>
<p>No less than life, with grace 37 , health, beauty, honour:</p>
<p>As much as child e’er loved or father found:</p>
<p>A love that makes breath poor 38 and speech unable 39 :</p>
<p>Beyond all manner of so much 40 I love you.</p>
<p>CORDELIA What shall Cordelia speak? Love and be silent.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>LEAR Of all these bounds 41 , even from this line to this,</p>
<p>Points to the map</p>
<p>With shadowy 42 forests and with champaigns riched 43 ,</p>
<p>With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads 44 ,</p>
<p>We make thee lady. To thine and Albany’s issues</p>
<p>Be this perpetual.— What says our second daughter?</p>
<p>Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall?</p>
<p>REGAN I am made of that self-mettle 45 as my sister,</p>
<p>And prize me at her worth 46 . In my true heart,</p>
<p>I find she names my very deed 47 of love:</p>
<p>Only she comes too short, that 48 I profess</p>
<p>Myself an enemy to all other joys</p>
<p>Which the most precious square of sense 49 professes,</p>
<p>And find I am alone felicitate 50</p>
<p>In your dear highness’ love.</p>
<p>CORDELIA Then poor Cordelia:</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>And yet not so, since I am sure my love’s</p>
<p>More ponderous 51 than my tongue.</p>
<p>LEAR To thee and thine hereditary 52 ever</p>
<p>Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,</p>
<p>No less in space, validity 53 and pleasure</p>
<p>Than that conferred on Goneril. — Now, our joy,</p>
<p>To Cordelia</p>
<p>Although our last and least, to whose young love</p>
<p>The vines of France and milk of Burgundy 54</p>
<p>Strive to be interessed 55 , what can you say to draw 56</p>
<p>A third more opulent than your sisters’? Speak.</p>
<p>CORDELIA Nothing, my lord.</p>
<p>LEAR Nothing?</p>
<p>CORDELIA Nothing.</p>
<p>LEAR Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.</p>
<p>CORDELIA Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave</p>
<p>My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty</p>
<p>According to my bond 57 , no more nor less.</p>
<p>LEAR How, how, Cordelia? Mend 58 your speech a little,</p>
<p>Lest you may mar 59 your fortunes.</p>
<p>CORDELIA Good my lord,</p>
<p>You have begot 60 me, bred 61 me, loved me:</p>
<p>I return those duties back as are right fit,</p>
<p>Obey you, love you and most honour you.</p>
<p>Why have my sisters husbands if they say</p>
<p>They love you all? Happily when I shall wed,</p>
<p>That lord whose hand must take my plight 62 shall carry</p>
<p>Half my love with him, half my care and duty:</p>
<p>Sure I shall never marry like my sisters.</p>
<p>LEAR But goes thy heart with this?</p>
<p>CORDELIA Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p>LEAR So young and so untender 63 ?</p>
<p>CORDELIA So young, my lord, and true.</p>
<p>LEAR Let it be so: thy truth then be thy dower,</p>
<p>For by the sacred radiance of the sun,</p>
<p>The mysteries of Hecate 64 and the night,</p>
<p>By all the operation 65 of the orbs 66</p>
<p>From whom we do exist and cease to be,</p>
<p>Here I disclaim all my paternal care,</p>
<p>Propinquity and property of blood 67 ,</p>
<p>And as a stranger to my heart and me</p>
<p>Hold thee from this 68 for ever. The barbarous Scythian 69 ,</p>
<p>Or he that makes his generation 70 messes 71</p>
<p>To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom</p>
<p>Be as well neighboured 72 , pitied and relieved</p>
<p>As thou my sometime 73 daughter.</p>
<p>KENT Good my liege 74 —</p>
<p>LEAR Peace, Kent:</p>
<p>Come not between the dragon and his wrath.</p>
<p>I loved her most, and thought to set my rest 75</p>
<p>On her kind 76 nursery 77 .— Hence, and avoid 78 my sight!—</p>
<p>To Cordelia</p>
<p>So be my grave my peace, as here I give</p>
<p>Her father’s heart from her. Call France. Who stirs 79 ?</p>
<p>Call Burgundy.— Cornwall and Albany,</p>
<p>[Exit Attendant ]</p>
<p>With my two daughters’ dowers digest 80 the third.</p>
<p>Let pride, which she calls plainness 81 , marry her 82 .</p>
<p>I do invest you jointly with my power,</p>
<p>Pre-eminence, and all the large effects 83</p>
<p>That troop with 84 majesty. Ourself by monthly course,</p>
<p>With reservation of 85 an hundred knights</p>
<p>By you to be sustained 86 , shall our abode</p>
<p>Make with you by due turn: only we shall retain</p>
<p>The name and all th’addition to 87 a king: the sway 88 ,</p>
<p>Revenue, execution of the rest,</p>
<p>Belovèd sons, be yours, which to confirm,</p>
<p>This coronet part between you.</p>
<p>Gives them coronet to break in half</p>
<p>KENT Royal Lear,</p>
<p>Whom I have ever honoured as my king,</p>
<p>Loved as my father, as my master followed,</p>
<p>As my great patron thought on in my prayers—</p>
<p>LEAR The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft 89 .</p>
<p>KENT Let it fall rather, though the fork 90 invade</p>
<p>The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly</p>
<p>When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou 91 do, old man?</p>
<p>Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak</p>
<p>When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour’s bound</p>
<p>When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state 92 ,</p>
<p>And in thy best consideration 93 check</p>
<p>This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgement 94 :</p>
<p>Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,</p>
<p>Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sounds</p>
<p>Reverb no hollowness 95 .</p>
<p>LEAR Kent, on thy life, no more.</p>
<p>KENT My life I never held 96 but as pawn 97</p>
<p>To wage 98 against thine enemies, ne’er fear to lose it,</p>
<p>Thy safety being motive.</p>
<p>LEAR Out of my sight!</p>
<p>KENT See better, Lear, and let me still remain</p>
<p>The true blank 99 of thine eye.</p>
<p>LEAR Now, by Apollo 100 —</p>
<p>KENT Now, by Apollo, king,</p>
<p>Thou swear’st thy gods in vain.</p>
<p>LEAR O, vassal 101 ! Miscreant 102 !</p>
<p>Puts his hand on his sword or attacks Kent</p>
<p>ALBANY and CORDELIA Dear sir, forbear 103 .</p>
<p>KENT Kill 104 thy physician, and thy fee bestow</p>
<p>Upon the foul disease 105 . Revoke thy gift,</p>
<p>Or whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,</p>
<p>I’ll tell thee thou dost evil.</p>
<p>LEAR Hear me, recreant 106 , on thine allegiance hear me!</p>
<p>That 107 thou hast sought to make us break our vows,</p>
<p>Which we durst 108 never yet, and with strained 109 pride</p>
<p>To come betwixt our sentences 110 and our power,</p>
<p>Which nor our nature nor 111 our place 112 can bear,</p>
<p>Our potency 113 made good 114 , take thy reward:</p>
<p>Five days we do allot thee for provision</p>
<p>To shield thee from disasters 115 of the world,</p>
<p>And on the sixth to turn thy hated back</p>
<p>Upon our kingdom: if on the next day following</p>
<p>Thy banished trunk 116 be found in our dominions,</p>
<p>The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter 117 ,</p>
<p>This shall not be revoked.</p>
<p>KENT Fare thee well, king: sith 118 thus thou wilt appear,</p>
<p>Freedom lives hence and banishment is here.—</p>
<p>The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,</p>
<p>To Cordelia</p>
<p>That justly think’st, and hast most rightly said.—</p>
<p>And your large speeches may your deeds approve 119 ,</p>
<p>To Goneril and Regan</p>
<p>That good effects may spring from words of love.</p>
<p>Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu.</p>
<p>He’ll shape his old course 120 in a country new.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Flourish 121 . Enter Gloucester with France and Burgundy,
Attendants</p>
<p>CORDELIA Here’s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.</p>
<p>LEAR My lord of Burgundy,</p>
<p>We first address toward you, who with this king</p>
<p>Hath rivalled 122 for our daughter: what in the least 123</p>
<p>Will you require in present dower 124 with her,</p>
<p>Or cease your quest of love?</p>
<p>BURGUNDY Most royal majesty,</p>
<p>I crave no more than hath your highness offered,</p>
<p>Nor will you tender 125 less.</p>
<p>LEAR Right noble Burgundy,</p>
<p>When she was dear to us, we did hold her so 126 ,</p>
<p>But now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands:</p>
<p>If aught 127 within that little seeming substance 128 ,</p>
<p>Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced 129 ,</p>
<p>And nothing more, may fitly like 130 your grace,</p>
<p>She’s there, and she is yours.</p>
<p>BURGUNDY I know no answer.</p>
<p>LEAR Will you, with those infirmities 131 she owes 132 ,</p>
<p>Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,</p>
<p>Dowered with 133 our curse and strangered 134 with our oath,</p>
<p>Take her or leave her?</p>
<p>BURGUNDY Pardon me, royal sir:</p>
<p>Election makes not up 135 in such conditions.</p>
<p>LEAR Then leave her, sir, for by the power that made me,</p>
<p>I tell you 136 all her wealth.— For you, great king,</p>
<p>To France</p>
<p>I would not from your love make such a stray 137</p>
<p>To match you where I hate, therefore beseech you</p>
<p>T’avert your liking a more worthier way</p>
<p>Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed</p>
<p>Almost t’acknowledge hers.</p>
<p>FRANCE This is most strange,</p>
<p>That she whom even but now was your object 138 ,</p>
<p>The argument 139 of your praise, balm 140 of your age,</p>
<p>The best, the dearest, should in this trice 141 of time</p>
<p>Commit a thing so monstrous 142 to dismantle 143</p>
<p>So many folds of favour. Sure her offence</p>
<p>Must be of such unnatural degree</p>
<p>That monsters it 144 , or your fore-vouched 145 affection</p>
<p>Fall into taint 146 , which to believe of her</p>
<p>Must be a faith that reason without miracle</p>
<p>Should never plant in me 147 .</p>
<p>CORDELIA I yet beseech your majesty —</p>
<p>If for 148 I want 149 that glib and oily art</p>
<p>To speak and purpose not 150 , since what I will intend</p>
<p>I’ll do’t before I speak — that you make known</p>
<p>It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness 151 ,</p>
<p>No unchaste action or dishonoured step</p>
<p>That hath deprived me of your grace and favour,</p>
<p>But even for want of that for which 152 I am richer:</p>
<p>A still-soliciting 153 eye and such a tongue</p>
<p>That I am glad I have not, though not to have it</p>
<p>Hath lost me in your liking.</p>
<p>LEAR Better thou hadst</p>
<p>Not been born than not t’have pleased me better.</p>
<p>FRANCE Is it but this? A tardiness in nature 154 ,</p>
<p>Which often leaves the history 155 unspoke</p>
<p>That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,</p>
<p>What say you to the lady? Love’s not love</p>
<p>When it is mingled with regards that stands</p>
<p>Aloof from th’entire point 156 . Will you have her?</p>
<p>She is herself a dowry.</p>
<p>BURGUNDY Royal king,</p>
<p>To Lear</p>
<p>Give but that portion which yourself proposed,</p>
<p>And here I take Cordelia by the hand,</p>
<p>Duchess of Burgundy.</p>
<p>LEAR Nothing: I have sworn: I am firm.</p>
<p>BURGUNDY I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father</p>
<p>To Cordelia</p>
<p>That you must lose a husband.</p>
<p>CORDELIA Peace be with Burgundy.</p>
<p>Since that respect and fortunes 157 are his love,</p>
<p>I shall not be his wife.</p>
<p>FRANCE Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich being poor,</p>
<p>Most choice forsaken 158 , and most loved despised,</p>
<p>Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon 159 :</p>
<p>Be it lawful 160 , I take up what’s cast away.</p>
<p>Takes her hand</p>
<p>Gods, gods! ’Tis strange that from their 161 cold’st neglect</p>
<p>My love should kindle to inflamed 162 respect.—</p>
<p>Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance 163 ,</p>
<p>Is queen of us, of ours and our fair France:</p>
<p>Not all the dukes of wat’rish 164 Burgundy</p>
<p>Can buy this unprized 165 precious maid of me.—</p>
<p>Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind 166 .</p>
<p>Thou losest here, a better where 167 to find.</p>
<p>LEAR Thou hast her, France: let her be thine, for we</p>
<p>Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see</p>
<p>That face of hers again. Therefore be gone</p>
<p>Without our grace 168 , our love, our benison 169 .</p>
<p>Come, noble Burgundy.</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt. [France and the sisters remain ]</p>
<p>FRANCE Bid farewell to your sisters.</p>
<p>CORDELIA The jewels of our father, with washèd 170 eyes</p>
<p>Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are,</p>
<p>And like a sister am most loath to call</p>
<p>Your faults as they are named 171 . Love well our father:</p>
<p>To your professèd bosoms 172 I commit 173 him,</p>
<p>But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,</p>
<p>I would prefer 174 him to a better place.</p>
<p>So farewell to you both.</p>
<p>REGAN Prescribe not us our duty.</p>
<p>GONERIL Let your study 175</p>
<p>Be to content your lord who hath received you</p>
<p>At fortune’s alms 176 . You have obedience scanted 177 ,</p>
<p>And well are worth the want that you have wanted 178 .</p>
<p>CORDELIA Time shall unfold what plighted cunning 179 hides:</p>
<p>Who covers faults, at last with shame derides 180 .</p>
<p>Well may you prosper.</p>
<p>FRANCE Come, my fair Cordelia.</p>
<p>Exit France and Cordelia</p>
<p>GONERIL Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly
181 appertains to us both. I think our father will hence tonight.</p>
<p>REGAN That’s most certain, and with you: next month with us.</p>
<p>GONERIL You see how full of changes his age is: the observation we
have made of it hath not been little. He always loved our sister most,
and with what poor judgement he hath now cast her off appears too
grossly 182 .</p>
<p>REGAN ’Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever 183 but
slenderly 184 known himself.</p>
<p>GONERIL The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash 185 .
Then must we look 186 from his age to receive not alone the
imperfections of long-engrafted condition 187 , but therewithal 188 the
unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric 189 years bring with
them.</p>
<p>REGAN Such unconstant starts 190 are we like to have from him as this
of Kent’s banishment.</p>
<p>GONERIL There is further compliment 191 of leave-taking between
France and him. Pray you let us sit together 192 : if our father carry
193 authority with such disposition 194 as he bears, this last surrender
195 of his will but offend 196 us.</p>
<p>REGAN We shall further think of it.</p>
<p>GONERIL We must do something, and i’th’heat 197 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
