<p>Flourish 2 of trumpets, then hautboys 3 . Enter King [Henry VI ],
Duke Humphrey [of Gloucester ], Salisbury, Warwick and [Cardinal ]
Beaufort on the one side. The Queen [Margare t], Suffolk, York, Somerset
and Buckingham on the other</p>
<p>SUFFOLK As by your high imperial majesty</p>
<p>I had in charge 4 at my depart 5 for France,</p>
<p>As procurator to 6 your excellence,</p>
<p>To marry 7 Princess Margaret for 8 your grace,</p>
<p>So, in the famous ancient city, Tours 9 ,</p>
<p>In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil 10 ,</p>
<p>The Dukes of Orléans, Calaber 11 , Bretagne 12 and Alençon,</p>
<p>Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,</p>
<p>I have performed my task and was espoused 13 ,</p>
<p>And humbly now upon my bended knee,</p>
<p>In sight of England and her lordly peers,</p>
<p>Deliver up my title in the queen</p>
<p>To your most gracious hands, that are the substance</p>
<p>Of that great shadow 14 I did represent:</p>
<p>The happiest 15 gift that ever marquis 16 gave,</p>
<p>The fairest queen that ever king received.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:</p>
<p>I can express no kinder 17 sign of love</p>
<p>Than this kind kiss: O Lord, that lends me life,</p>
<p>Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness:</p>
<p>For thou hast given me in this beauteous face</p>
<p>A world of earthly blessings to my soul,</p>
<p>If sympathy 18 of love unite our thoughts.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Great King of England and my gracious lord,</p>
<p>The mutual conference 19 that my mind hath had,</p>
<p>By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,</p>
<p>In courtly company or at my beads 20 ,</p>
<p>With you, mine alderliefest 21 sovereign,</p>
<p>Makes me the bolder to salute 22 my king</p>
<p>With ruder 23 terms, such as my wit 24 affords</p>
<p>And overjoy of heart doth minister 25 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Her sight 26 did ravish, but her grace in speech,</p>
<p>Her words yclad 27 with wisdom’s majesty,</p>
<p>Makes me from wond’ring 28 fall to weeping joys,</p>
<p>Such is the fullness of my heart’s content.</p>
<p>Lords, with one cheerful voice, welcome my love.</p>
<p>ALL Long live Queen Margaret, England’s happiness</p>
<p>Kneel</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET We thank you all.</p>
<p>Flourish</p>
<p>They rise</p>
<p>SUFFOLK My Lord Protector 29 , so 30 it please your grace,</p>
<p>To Gloucester</p>
<p>Here are the articles 31 of contracted 32 peace</p>
<p>Between our sovereign and the French King Charles,</p>
<p>For eighteen months concluded 33 by consent.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Reads. ’Imprimis 34 , it is agreed between the French King
Charles, and William de la Pole, Marquess of Suffolk, ambassador for
Henry King of England, that the said Henry shall espouse the Lady
Margaret, daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia and Jerusalem,
and crown her Queen of England ere 35 the thirtieth of May next
ensuing.</p>
<p>Item 36 : that the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be
released and delivered to the king her father’—</p>
<p>Lets the paper fall</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Uncle, how now?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Pardon me, gracious lord,</p>
<p>Some sudden qualm 37 hath struck me at the heart</p>
<p>And dimmed mine eyes, that 38 I can read no further.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Uncle 39 of Winchester, I pray, read on.</p>
<p>CARDINAL ‘Item : it is further agreed between them, that the duchies
of 40 Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered over to the king
her father, and she sent over of the King of England’s own proper 41
cost and charges, without having any dowry.’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI They please us well.— Lord marquis, kneel down:</p>
<p>To Suffolk</p>
<p>We here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk,</p>
<p>Suffolk kneels</p>
<p>And gird 42 thee with the sword.—</p>
<p>Suffolk rises</p>
<p>Cousin 43 of York,</p>
<p>We here discharge your grace from being regent 44</p>
<p>I’th’parts of France, till term of eighteen months</p>
<p>Be full 45 expired. Thanks, uncle Winchester,</p>
<p>Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,</p>
<p>Salisbury and Warwick.</p>
<p>We thank you all for this great favour done,</p>
<p>In entertainment 46 to my princely 47 queen.</p>
<p>Come, let us in, and with all speed provide 48</p>
<p>To see her coronation be performed.</p>
<p>Exeunt King [Henry V I], Queen [Margare t] and Suffolk. The rest
remain</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Brave 49 peers of England, pillars of the state,</p>
<p>To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief:</p>
<p>Your grief, the common grief of all the land.</p>
<p>What? Did my brother Henry 50 spend his youth,</p>
<p>His valour, coin and people, in the wars?</p>
<p>Did he so often lodge 51 in open field,</p>
<p>In winter’s cold and summer’s parching heat,</p>
<p>To conquer France, his true inheritance?</p>
<p>And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,</p>
<p>To keep by policy 52 what Henry got?</p>
<p>Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,</p>
<p>Brave York, Salisbury and victorious Warwick,</p>
<p>Received deep scars in France and Normandy:</p>
<p>Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,</p>
<p>With all the learnèd Council 53 of the realm,</p>
<p>Studied so long, sat in the Council house</p>
<p>Early and late, debating to and fro</p>
<p>How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe 54 ,</p>
<p>And had his highness in his infancy</p>
<p>Crownèd in Paris in despite of foes?</p>
<p>And shall these labours and these honours die?</p>
<p>Shall Henry’s conquest, Bedford’s vigilance,</p>
<p>Your deeds of war and all our counsel 55 die?</p>
<p>O peers of England, shameful is this league 56 ,</p>
<p>Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame 57 ,</p>
<p>Blotting your names from books of memory,</p>
<p>Razing 58 the characters 59 of your renown,</p>
<p>Defacing monuments 60 of conquered France,</p>
<p>Undoing all, as 61 all had never been!</p>
<p>CARDINAL Nephew, what means this passionate discourse?</p>
<p>This peroration 62 with such circumstance 63 :</p>
<p>For France, ’tis ours; and we will keep it still.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can:</p>
<p>But now it is impossible we should.</p>
<p>Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roost,</p>
<p>Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine</p>
<p>Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style 64</p>
<p>Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.</p>
<p>SALISBURY Now by the death of him that died for all 65 ,</p>
<p>These counties were the keys of Normandy.—</p>
<p>But wherefore 66 weeps Warwick, my valiant son?</p>
<p>WARWICK For grief that they are past recovery.</p>
<p>For were there hope to conquer them again,</p>
<p>My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.</p>
<p>Anjou and Maine? Myself did win them both:</p>
<p>Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer.</p>
<p>And are the cities that I got with wounds</p>
<p>Delivered up again with peaceful words?</p>
<p>Mort Dieu 67 !</p>
<p>YORK For 68 Suffolk’s duke, may he be suffocate 69 ,</p>
<p>That dims the honour of this warlike isle:</p>
<p>France should have torn and rent 70 my very heart</p>
<p>Before I would have yielded to this league.</p>
<p>I never read but England’s kings have had</p>
<p>Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:</p>
<p>And our King Henry gives away his own,</p>
<p>To match 71 with her that brings no vantages 72 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER A proper 73 jest, and never heard before,</p>
<p>That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth 74</p>
<p>For costs and charges in transporting her:</p>
<p>She should have stayed in France and starved in France,</p>
<p>Before—</p>
<p>CARDINAL My lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot 75 :</p>
<p>It was the pleasure 76 of my lord the king.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER My lord of Winchester, I know your mind.</p>
<p>’Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,</p>
<p>But ’tis my presence that doth trouble ye.</p>
<p>Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face</p>
<p>I see thy fury: if I longer stay,</p>
<p>We shall begin our ancient 77 bickerings.—</p>
<p>Lordings 78 , farewell, and say when I am gone,</p>
<p>I prophesied France will be lost ere long.</p>
<p>Exit Humphrey [Gloucester ]</p>
<p>CARDINAL So, there goes our Protector in a rage:</p>
<p>’Tis known to you he is mine enemy:</p>
<p>Nay more, an enemy unto you all,</p>
<p>And no great friend, I fear me, to the king:</p>
<p>Consider, lords, he is the next of blood 79</p>
<p>And heir apparent to the English crown:</p>
<p>Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,</p>
<p>And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west 80 ,</p>
<p>There’s reason he should be displeased at it.</p>
<p>Look to it, lords: let not his smoothing 81 words</p>
<p>Bewitch your hearts: be wise and circumspect.</p>
<p>What though the common people favour him,</p>
<p>Calling him ‘Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester’,</p>
<p>Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,</p>
<p>‘Jesu maintain your royal excellence!’</p>
<p>With ‘God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!’</p>
<p>I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss 82 ,</p>
<p>He 83 will be found a dangerous Protector.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Why should he then protect our sovereign,</p>
<p>He being of age to govern of himself?</p>
<p>Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,</p>
<p>And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,</p>
<p>We’ll quickly hoist Duke Humphrey from his seat.</p>
<p>CARDINAL This weighty business will not brook 84 delay:</p>
<p>I’ll to the Duke of Suffolk presently 85 .</p>
<p>Exit Cardinal</p>
<p>SOMERSET Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey’s pride</p>
<p>And greatness of his place be grief to us,</p>
<p>Yet let us watch the haughty 86 cardinal:</p>
<p>His insolence is more intolerable</p>
<p>Than 87 all the princes in the land beside:</p>
<p>If Gloucester be displaced, he’ll be Protector.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Or 88 thou or I, Somerset, will be Protector,</p>
<p>Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal</p>
<p>Exeunt Buckingham and Somerset</p>
<p>SALISBURY Pride 89 went before, ambition 90 follows him.</p>
<p>While these do labour for their own preferment 91 ,</p>
<p>Behoves it 92 us to labour for the realm.</p>
<p>I never saw but 93 Humphrey Duke of Gloucester</p>
<p>Did bear him 94 like a noble gentleman:</p>
<p>Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,</p>
<p>More like a soldier than a man o’th’Church,</p>
<p>As stout 95 and proud as 96 he were lord of all,</p>
<p>Swear like a ruffian and demean 97 plainness 98 himself</p>
<p>Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.</p>
<p>Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,</p>
<p>Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping 99</p>
<p>Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,</p>
<p>Excepting none but 100 good Duke Humphrey.</p>
<p>And, brother 101 York, thy acts in Ireland</p>
<p>In bringing them to civil discipline,</p>
<p>Thy late 102 exploits done in the heart of France,</p>
<p>When thou wert regent for our sovereign,</p>
<p>Have made thee feared and honoured of the people:</p>
<p>Join we together for the public good,</p>
<p>In what we can, to bridle 103 and suppress</p>
<p>The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,</p>
<p>With Somerset’s and Buckingham’s ambition:</p>
<p>And, as we may, cherish 104 Duke Humphrey’s deeds,</p>
<p>While they do tend 105 the profit of the land.</p>
<p>WARWICK So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,</p>
<p>And common 106 profit of his country.</p>
<p>YORK And so says York,— for he hath greatest cause 107 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>SALISBURY Then let’s make haste away, and look unto the main 108
.</p>
<p>WARWICK Unto the main? O, father, Maine 109 is lost,</p>
<p>That Maine which by main 110 force Warwick did win,</p>
<p>And would have kept so long as breath did last:</p>
<p>Main chance, father, you meant, but I meant Maine,</p>
<p>Which I will win from France, or else be slain,</p>
<p>Exeunt Warwick and Salisbury, leaving York</p>
<p>YORK Anjou and Maine are given to the French,</p>
<p>Paris is lost, the state of Normandy</p>
<p>Stands on a tickle 111 point now they are gone:</p>
<p>Suffolk concluded 112 on the articles,</p>
<p>The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased</p>
<p>To change 113 two dukedoms for a duke’s fair daughter.</p>
<p>I cannot blame them all: what is’t to them?</p>
<p>’Tis thine 114 they give away, and not their own.</p>
<p>Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage 115</p>
<p>And purchase friends 116 and give to courtesans 117 ,</p>
<p>Still 118 revelling like lords till all be gone,</p>
<p>While as 119 the silly 120 owner of the goods</p>
<p>Weeps over them, and wrings his hapless 121 hands,</p>
<p>And shakes his head, and trembling 122 stands aloof 123 ,</p>
<p>While all is shared and all is borne away,</p>
<p>Ready 124 to starve and dare not touch his own.</p>
<p>So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,</p>
<p>While his own lands are bargained for and sold:</p>
<p>Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland</p>
<p>Bear that proportion 125 to my flesh and blood,</p>
<p>As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt</p>
<p>Unto the prince’s heart of Calydon 126 .</p>
<p>Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!</p>
<p>Cold news for me: for I had hope of France,</p>
<p>Even as I have of fertile England’s soil.</p>
<p>A day will come when York shall claim his own,</p>
<p>And therefore I will take the Nevilles’ 127 parts</p>
<p>And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,</p>
<p>And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,</p>
<p>For that’s the golden mark 128 I seek to hit:</p>
<p>Nor shall proud Lancaster 129 usurp my right,</p>
<p>Nor hold the sceptre in his childish 130 fist,</p>
<p>Nor wear the diadem 131 upon his head,</p>
<p>Whose church-like humours 132 fits not for a crown.</p>
<p>Then, York, be still 133 awhile, till time do serve 134 :</p>
<p>Watch 135 thou, and wake when others be asleep,</p>
<p>To pry into the secrets of the state,</p>
<p>Till Henry, surfeiting 136 in joys of love,</p>
<p>With his new bride and England’s dear-bought 137 queen,</p>
<p>And Humphrey with the peers be fall’n at jars 138 :</p>
<p>Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose 139 ,</p>
<p>With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed,</p>
<p>And in my standard 140 bear the arms of York,</p>
<p>To grapple 141 with the House of Lancaster:</p>
<p>And force perforce 142 I’ll make him yield the crown,</p>
<p>Whose bookish 143 rule hath pulled fair England down.</p>
<p>Exit York</p>
