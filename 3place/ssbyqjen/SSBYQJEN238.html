<h4 id="introduction-to-alls-well-that-ends-well">Introduction to All’s
Well that Ends Well</h4>
<p>All’s Well that Ends Well is one of Shakespeare’s least performed and
least loved comedies. It is also one of his most fascinating and
intriguingly modern works. The play presents a battlefield of opposing
value-systems: abstract codes jostle against material commodities, words
are undermined by actions, generation argues with generation, and a sex
war rages.</p>
<p>The language of sexual relations is persistently intermingled with
that of warfare. The key word, deployed with equal force in
conversations about the bedroom, the court and the battlefield, is
‘honour’. The atmosphere feels very different from that of Shakespeare’s
comic green world. All’s Well shares the darker view of human nature and
the more troubling preoccupations of three other plays written at the
end of Queen Elizabeth I’s reign and the beginning of James I’s: Troilus
and Cressida, Othello and Measure for Measure .</p>
<p>In the very first scene, virginity is described by Parolles as
woman’s weapon of resistance. But man will besiege it, ‘undermine’ it
and ‘blow up’ his foe – make her pregnant. Like honour, virginity may
variously be seen as a mystical treasure, a mark of integrity, a
marketable commodity and a kind of nothing. Traditional wisdom suggests
that it is something a girl must preserve with care. But the play is
full of proverbs and moral maxims that are found wanting, ‘undermined’
by the demands of the body. Lavatch, Shakespeare’s most cynical and
lascivious fool, is on hand to remind us of this. ‘I am driven on by the
flesh’, he remarks, suggesting that the story of the sexes boils down to
‘Tib’s rush for Tom’s forefinger’. ‘Tib’ was a generic name for a whore;
the ‘rush’ is a rudimentary wedding ring fashioned from reeds, but a
woman’s ‘ring’ is also the place where she is penetrated by a man’s
nether finger.</p>
<p>‘War’, says Bertram, ‘is no strife / To the dark house and the
detested wife.’ For a young man in search of action, a wife is but a
‘clog’, a block of wood tied to an animal to prevent it from escaping.
Parolles voices the same sentiment in the tumble of language that is his
hallmark:</p>
<p>To th’wars, my boy, to th’wars!</p>
<p>He wears his honour in a box unseen</p>
<p>That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,</p>
<p>Spending his manly marrow in her arms,</p>
<p>Which should sustain the bound and high curvet</p>
<p>Of Mars’ fiery steed. To other regions,</p>
<p>France is a stable, we that dwell in’t jades:</p>
<p>Therefore, to th’war!</p>
<p>‘Kicky-wicky’ is an abusive term for a wife, the ‘box unseen’ is the
vagina and ‘marrow’ is the essence of manliness (according to ancient
physiology, semen was distilled from the marrow in the backbone). A
proper man, Parolles suggests, should be off riding a ‘fiery steed’ into
battle, in the spirit of Mars, god of war; those who stay at home are no
better than female horses good only for breeding and sexual indulgence
(‘jade’ was another slang term for ‘whore’).</p>
<p>All’s Well is in the mainstream of comedy insofar as it is about
young people and the process of growing up. Bertram is like most young
men of every era: he wants to be one of the boys, to prove his manhood.
Enlistment in the army provides the ideal opportunity. He wants to sow
some wild oats along the way, but is not ready for marriage. Critics
hate him for not loving the lovely humble Helen from the start. ‘I
cannot reconcile my heart to Bertram,’ wrote Dr Johnson with
characteristic candour and forthrightness, ‘a man noble without
generosity, and young without truth; who marries Helen as a coward, and
leaves her as a profligate: when she is dead by his unkindness, sneaks
home to a second marriage, is accused by a woman whom he has wronged,
defends himself by falsehood, and is dismissed to happiness.’ Of course
there is something obnoxious in the snobbery with which Bertram first
dismisses Helen on the grounds of her low status, but when he goes on to
say that he is simply not in love with her, he reveals a kind of
integrity. He bows to the king’s will and marries her, but since his
heart does not belong to her he refuses to give her his body. If a woman
were forced to marry in this way, we would rather admire her for
withholding sexual favours from her husband.</p>
<p>Bertram represents modernity in that he acts according to an
existential principle: he follows his own self, not some pre-existent
code of duty, service to his monarch or obligation to the older
generation. One word for this code is indeed integrity. Another is
selfishness. It is the prerogative of the old, especially mothers, to
know, to suffer and still to forgive the selfishness of their young.
Bertram’s mother, the widowed Countess of Rossillion, who treats the
orphaned Helen like a daughter and is only too happy to accept her as a
daughter-in-law, regardless of her lowly background, was described by
George Bernard Shaw as ‘the most beautiful old woman’s part ever
written’ (though she could perfectly well be in her forties). Since
female parts were written for young male actors, strong maternal roles
such as this are exceptional in Shakespeare. The only analogous parts
are the more overbearing figures of Queen Margaret in the Henry VI
plays, Tamora in Titus Andronicus and Volumnia in Coriolanus . The
serenity of the countess has meant that the principal reason for modern
revivals of All’s Well has been the opportunity to showcase actresses
such as Edith Evans, Peggy Ashcroft and Judi Dench in their later
years.</p>
<p>One of the key debates in the play is that between nature and
nurture. The Countess of Rossillion believes that her son is a
fundamentally good boy who has fallen into bad company, as embodied by
the worthless Parolles. Helen, meanwhile, has strong natural qualities
(the ‘dispositions she inherits’) reinforced by a loving and responsible
upbringing (the ‘education’ she has received first from her doctor
father, then in the household of the countess).</p>
<p>Parallel to the question of nature and nurture is that of divine
providence and individual responsibility. Helen believes that ‘Our
remedies oft in ourselves do lie, / Which we ascribe to heaven’: like
Bertram, she is a voice of modernity in her belief that individuals can
carve their own destiny. She does so by means of disguise and bold solo
travel: from Roussillon in south-west France to Paris, where she gains
access to the king, then to Florence in the dress of a pilgrim en route
to Compostella. Like Julia in The Two Gentlemen of Verona , Rosalind in
As You Like It and Viola in Twelfth Night , she uses her disguised self
as an opportunity to talk about her true feelings. The part is the
longest in the play and it gives an actor great opportunities for the
portrayal of an isolated young woman’s selfexploration through both
soliloquy and dialogue in lucid and serpentine verse, not to mention
passages of prose banter and some piercing asides.</p>
<p>As Dr Johnson dryly noted, the geography seems somewhay awry when
Helen undertakes her pilgrimage: in going from France to Spain via
Italy, she is ‘somewhat out of the road’. Such details did not matter to
Shakespeare. For him, the pilgrim motif – taken over from the story in
Boccaccio that was his source for the main plot of the play – had
symbolic importance in that it associated Helen with an older value
structure of reverence and self-sacrifice even as she asserts her own
will. Pilgrims are people who believe in miracles, so Helen’s adoption
of the role allies her with the world-view voiced by the old courtier
Lafew after she has cured the king: ‘They say miracles are past, and we
have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar, things
supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors,
ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit
ourselves to an unknown fear.’</p>
<p>Yet Helen is only a pretended pilgrim and the king has been cured not
by a miracle but by the medical knowledge she has inherited from her
father. Again and again the play takes a fairy-tale motif and turns it
into something tougher, more earthly and open to philosophical debate.
Lafew’s generalization sets up the key scene in which Bertram rejects
Helen. The idea of unquestioning obedience to the king’s will is itself
a thing ‘supernatural and causeless’. It depends upon an ‘unknown fear’,
the mystique of monarchy, the idea that the king is God’s representative
on earth and that to challenge him will cause the entire fabric of the
natural order to collapse. In a crucial rhyming couplet near the end of
the play – often editorially reassigned to the Countess of Rossillion
for no good textual reason – the king says that, since he has failed in
his management of Bertram’s first marriage, the second had better be a
success otherwise ‘nature’ may as well ‘cesse’ (cease).</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s instinctive conservatism tips the balance in favour of
the old order. The king, the countess and the old courtier are generous
and ethically admirable, much more obviously sympathetic than Bertram,
Parolles and Lavatch. Bertram has to be tricked out of his sexual
selfishness and Parolles out of his vainglory, but still Shakespeare the
role-player and wordsmith invests huge dramatic energy in the darker
characters. He uses them to open cracks in the established order. The
king tells Bertram that Helen should be viewed for what she is within,
not by way of the superficial trappings of wealth and rank: ‘The
property by what it is should go, / Not by the title.’ Yet his own
authority depends on his title, and the ‘go by what it is’ argument
might be turned to say that if Bertram does not love Helen he should not
marry her. The king moves swiftly from reasoning to the assertion of raw
authority: ‘My honour’s at the stake, which to defeat, / I must produce
my power.’ Shakespeare’s intensely compacted writing style makes the
point. By ‘which to defeat’, the king means ‘in order to defeat the
threat to my honour’, but ironically the very need to produce his
‘power’ itself defeats the code of honour. As so often in Shakespeare’s
darker plays, the figure of Niccolò Machiavelli lurks in the shadows,
whispering that fine old codes such as honour and duty can only be
underwritten by raw power.</p>
<p>He who asserts the new code of the self must live by that code. Both
Bertram and Parolles are found out. The two lords Dumaine are not only
mechanics in the double plot of ambush and bed trick, but also
commentators upon how their victims are brought to self-knowledge: ‘As
we are ourselves, what things we are! / Merely our own traitors.’ The
Dumaines too are young and modern in their recognition that we cannot
simply sort our kind into sheep and goats in the manner of authoritarian
religious dispensations. They propose instead that human life is shaded
grey: ‘The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together:
our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not; and our
crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtues.’ This
could be the epigraph for Shakespeare’s dramatically mingled yarn of
tragi-comedy.</p>
<p>Parolles comes to acknowledge his boastful tongue. ‘Simply the thing
I am / Shall make me live’, he vows. What, though, can this mean, given
that – as his name indicates – he is made of nothing but words? Bertram,
meanwhile, only comes to realize how much Helen is to be valued when she
has been lost. The fiction of comedy gives him a second chance to love
her. But in the modern world where there are no miracles, ‘all’s well
that ends well’ is a fiction. Along the way we have been promised on
more than one occasion that all will end well, but when it comes to the
climax the king says that ‘all yet seems well’ and that ‘if it end so
meet’ then all bitterness will be past. Those little conditional
qualifiers leave open the door to the tragic world.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Helen, orphaned daughter of a doctor, is under the protection
of the widowed Countess of Rossillion. In love with Bertram, the
countess’ son, Helen follows him to court, where she cures the sick
French king of an apparently fatal illness. The king rewards her by
offering her the husband of her choice. She names Bertram; he resists.
When forced by the king to marry her, he refuses to sleep with her and,
accompanied by the braggart Parolles, leaves for the Italian wars. He
says that he will only accept Helen if she obtains a ring from his
finger and becomes pregnant with his child. She goes to Italy disguised
as a pilgrim and suggests a ‘bed trick’ whereby she will take the place
of Diana, a widow’s daughter whom Bertram is trying to seduce. A
‘kidnapping trick’ humiliates the boastful Parolles, whilst the bed
trick enables Helen to fulfil Bertram’s conditions, leaving him no
option but to marry her, to his mother’s delight.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentages of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Helen (16%/109/12), Parolles (13%/141/11), King of France
(13%/87/4), Countess (10%/86/7), Bertram (9%102/10), Lafew (9%/97/7),
Lavatch (7%/58/6), First Lord Dumaine (5%/70/7), Second Lord Dumaine
(4%/47/6), Diana (4%/44/4), First Soldier/Interpreter (3%/37/2), Widow
(2%/21/5).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 55% verse, 45% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: No external evidence to indicate when written or first
performed; usually dated to early Jacobean years (1603–06) on stylistic
grounds and because of similarity to Measure for Measure . Moments of
anti-puritan satire do not help in determining a specific date.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Main plot derived from Giovanni Boccaccio’s Decameron
(Italian, fourteenth century) by way of William Painter’s English
translation, The Palace of Pleasure (1566); Countess and Lafew are
Shakespeare’s invention, as is Parolles, who is in the tradition of the
braggart soldier of classical comedy – a character type of which the
greatest Elizabethan examples were Falstaff in Henry IV and Captain
Bobadil in Ben Jonson’s Every Man in his Humour .</p>
<p>TEXT: First Folio of 1623 is only early printed text. Many features
such as misassigned speeches, repeated speech headings, inconsistent
naming and probably misplaced lines suggest that the manuscript was not
neatly prepared and that it caused confusion to the printers. Apparent
authorial first thoughts suggest influence of Shakespeare’s working
manuscript, whilst music cues suggest that of the theatrical promptbook.
Of the many textual problems, the most frustrating concerns the two
lords/brothers Dumaine: they have several different designations,
variants on ‘1 Lord G.’ and ‘2 Lord E.’, ‘French E.’ and ‘French G.’,
‘Captain G.’ and ‘Captain E.’ The initials are sometimes supposed to
refer to actors’ names. Shakespeare sometimes seems to forget whether
‘G.’ is ‘1’ and ‘E.’ is ‘2’ or vice versa. This means, for instance,
that there is confusion over which brother leads the ambush of Parolles
and which accompanies Bertram as he sets off to seduce Diana. We have
adopted a solution that is dramatically consistent whilst requiring only
minimal alteration of Folio’s speech ascriptions.</p>
