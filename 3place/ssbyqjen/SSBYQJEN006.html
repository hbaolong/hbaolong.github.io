<h4 id="introduction-to-the-tempest">Introduction to The Tempest</h4>
<p>The Tempest was almost certainly Shakespeare’s last solo-authored
play. We do not know whether he anticipated that this would be the case.
It was also the first play to be printed in the First Folio. Again, we
do not know whether it was given pride of place because the editors of
the Folio regarded it as a showpiece – the summation of the master’s art
– or for the more mundane reason that they had a clean copy in the clear
hand of the scribe Ralph Crane, which would have given the compositors a
relatively easy start as they set to work on the mammoth task of
typesetting nearly a million words of Shakespeare. Whether it found its
position by chance or design, The Tempest ’s place at the end of
Shakespeare’s career and the beginning of his collected works has
profoundly shaped responses to the play ever since the early nineteenth
century. It has come to be regarded as the touchstone of Shakespearean
interpretation.</p>
<p>The narrative is concentrated on questions of mastery and rule.
During the tempest in the opening scene, the normal social order is out
of joint: the boatswain commands the courtiers in the knowledge that the
roaring waves care nothing for ‘the name of king’. Then the back story,
unfolded at length in Act 1 scene 2, tells of conspirators who do not
respect the title of duke: we learn of Prospero’s loss of power in Milan
and the compensatory command he has gained over Ariel and Caliban on the
island. The Ferdinand and Miranda love-knot is directed towards the
future government of Milan and Naples. There is further politic
plotting: Sebastian and Antonio’s plan to murder King Alonso and good
Gonzalo, the madcap scheme of the base-born characters to overthrow
Prospero and make drunken butler Stephano king of the island. The
theatrical coups performed by Prospero, assisted by Ariel and the other
spirits of the island – the freezing of the conspirators, the harpy and
the vanishing banquet, the masque of goddesses and agricultural workers,
the revelation of the lovers playing at chess – all serve the purpose of
requiting the sins of the past, restoring order in the present and
preparing for a harmonious future. Once the work is done, Ariel is
released (with a pang) and Prospero is ready to prepare his own spirit
for death. Even Caliban will ‘seek for grace’.</p>
<p>But Shakespeare never keeps it simple. Prospero’s main aim in
conjuring up the storm and bringing the court to the island is to force
his usurping brother Antonio into repentance. Yet when the climactic
confrontation comes, Antonio does not say a word in reply to Prospero’s
combination of forgiveness and demand. He wholly fails to follow the
good example set by Alonso a few lines before. As for Antonio’s sidekick
Sebastian, he has the temerity to ascribe Prospero’s magical foresight
to demonic influence. For all the powers at Prospero’s command, there is
no way of predicting or controlling human nature. A conscience cannot be
created where there is none.</p>
<p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge described Prospero as ‘the very Shakespeare,
as it were, of the tempest’. In other words, the leading character’s
conjuring up of the storm in the opening scene corresponds to the
dramatist’s conjuring up of the whole world of the play. The art of
Prospero harnesses the power of nature in order to bring the other
Italian characters to join him in his exile; by the same account, the
art of Shakespeare transforms the platform of the stage into a ship at
sea and then ‘an uninhabited island’. ‘Art’ is the play’s key word.
Caliban is Prospero’s ‘other’ because he represents the state of nature.
In the Darwinian nineteenth century, he was recast as the ‘missing link’
between humankind and our animal ancestors.</p>
<p>Prospero’s back story tells of a progression from the ‘liberal arts’
that offered a training for governors to the more dangerous ‘art’ of
magic. Magical thinking was universal in the age of Shakespeare.
Everyone was brought up to believe that there was another realm beyond
that of nature, a realm of the spirit and of spirits. ‘Natural’ and
‘demonic’ magic were the two branches of the study and manipulation of
preternatural phenomena. Magic meant the knowledge of hidden things and
the art of working wonders. For some, it was the highest form of natural
philosophy: the word came from magia , the ancient Persian term for
wisdom. The ‘occult philosophy’, as it was known, postulated a hierarchy
of powers, with influence descending from disembodied (‘intellectual’)
angelic spirits to the stellar and planetary world of the heavens to
earthly things and their physical changes. The magician ascends to
knowledge of higher powers and draws them down artificially to produce
wonderful effects. Cornelius Agrippa, author of the influential De
occulta philosophia , argued that ‘ceremonial magic’ was needed in order
to reach the angelic intelligences above the stars. This was the highest
and most dangerous level of activity, since it was all too easy – as
Christopher Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus found – to conjure up a devil instead
of an angel. The more common form of ‘natural magic’ involved ‘marrying’
heaven to earth, working with the occult correspondences between the
stars and the elements of the material world. The enduring conception of
astrological influences is a vestige of this mode of thought. For a
Renaissance mage such as Girolamo Cardano, who practised in Milan,
medicine, natural philosophy, mathematics, astrology and dream
interpretation were all intimately connected.</p>
<p>But natural magic could never escape its demonic shadow. For every
learned mage such as Agrippa or Cardano, there were a thousand village
‘wise women’ practising folk medicine and fortunetelling. All too often,
the latter found themselves demonized as witches, blamed for crop
failure, livestock disease and the other ills of life in the pre-modern
era. Prospero is keen to contrast his own white magic with the black
arts of Sycorax, Caliban’s mother, but the play establishes strong
parallels between them. He was exiled from Milan to the island because
his devotion to his secret studies gave Antonio the opportunity to usurp
the dukedom, whilst Sycorax was exiled from Algiers to the island
because she was accused of witchcraft; he arrived with his young
daughter, whilst she arrived pregnant with the child she had supposedly
conceived by sleeping with the devil. Each of them can command the tides
and manipulate the spirit-world that is embodied by Ariel. When Prospero
comes to renounce his magic, he describes his powers in words borrowed
from the incantation of another witch, Medea in Ovid’s great storehouse
of ancient mythological tales, the Metamorphoses . Prospero at some
level registers his own kinship with Sycorax when he says of Caliban
‘this thing of darkness I / Acknowledge mine’. The splitting of subject
and verb across the line ending here, ensuring a moment’s hesitation in
the acknowledgement, is an extreme instance of the suppleness with which
late Shakespeare handles his iambic pentameter verse.</p>
<p>Shakespeare loved to set up oppositions, then shade his black and
white into grey areas of moral complexity. In Milan, Prospero’s
inward-looking study of the liberal arts had led to the loss of power
and the establishment of tyranny. On the island he seeks to make amends
by applying what he has learned, by using active magic to bring
repentance, restore his dukedom and set up a dynastic marriage. Yet at
the beginning of the fifth act he sees that to be truly human is a
matter not of exercising wisdom for the purposes of rule, but of
practising a more strictly Christian version of virtue. For
sixteenth-century humanists, education in princely virtue meant the
cultivation for political ends of wisdom, magnanimity, temperance and
integrity. For Prospero what finally matters is kindness. And this is
something that the master learns from his pupil: it is Ariel who teaches
Prospero about ‘feeling’, not vice versa.</p>
<p>Ariel represents fire and air, concord and music, loyal service.
Caliban is of the earth, associated with discord, drunkenness and
rebellion. Ariel’s medium of expression is delicate verse, whilst
Caliban’s is for the most part a robust, often ribald, prose like that
of the jester Trinculo and drunken butler Stephano. But, astonishingly,
it is Caliban who speaks the play’s most beautiful verse when he hears
the music of Ariel. Even in prose, Caliban has a wonderful attunement to
the natural environment: he knows every corner, every species of the
island. Prospero calls him ‘A devil, a born devil, on whose nature /
Nurture can never stick’, yet in the very next speech Caliban enters
with the line ‘Pray you tread softly, that the blind mole may not hear a
footfall’, words of such strong imagination that Prospero’s claim is
instantly belied.</p>
<p>Caliban’s purported sexual assault on Miranda shows that Prospero
failed in his attempt to tame the animal instincts of the ‘man-monster’
and educate him into humanity. But who bears responsibility for the
failure? Could it be that the problem arises from what Prospero has
imprinted on Caliban’s memory, not from the latter’s nature? Caliban
initially welcomed Prospero to the island and offered to share its
fruits, every bit in the manner of the ‘noble savages’ in Michel de
Montaigne’s essay ‘Of the Cannibals’, which was another source from
which Shakespeare quoted in the play (Gonzalo’s Utopian ‘golden age’
vision of how he would govern the isle is borrowed from the English
translation of Montaigne). Caliban only acts basely after Prospero has
printed that baseness on him; what makes Caliban ‘filth’ may be the
lessons in which Prospero has taught him that he is ‘filth’.</p>
<p>Caliban understands the power of the book: as fashioners of modern
coups d’état begin by seizing the television station, so he stresses
that the rebellion against Prospero must begin by taking possession of
his books. But Stephano has another book. ‘Here is that which will give
language to you’, he says to Caliban, replicating Prospero’s gaining of
control through language – but in a different mode. Textual inculcation
is replaced by intoxication: the book that is kissed is the bottle. The
dialogic spirit that is fostered by Shakespeare’s technique of scenic
counterpoint thus calls into question Prospero’s use of books. If
Stephano and Trinculo achieve through their alcohol what Prospero
achieves through his teaching (in each case Caliban is persuaded to
serve and to share the fruits of the isle), is not that teaching exposed
as potentially nothing more than a means of social control? Prospero
often seems more interested in the power-structure that is established
by his schoolmastering than in the substance of what he teaches. It is
hard to see how making Ferdinand carry logs is intended to inculcate
virtue; its purpose is to elicit submission.</p>
<p>Arrival on an island uninhabited by Europeans, talk of ‘plantation’,
an encounter with a ‘savage’ in which alcohol is exchanged for survival
skills, a process of language learning in which it is made clear who is
master and who is slave, fear that the slave will impregnate the
master’s daughter, the desire to make the savage seek for Christian
‘grace’ (though also a proposal that he should be shipped to England and
exhibited for profit), references to the dangerous weather of the
Bermudas and to a ‘brave new world’: in all these respects, The Tempest
conjures up the spirit of European colonialism. Shakespeare had contacts
with members of the Virginia Company, which had been established by
royal charter in 1606 and was instrumental in the foundation of the
Jamestown colony in America the following year. Some time in the autumn
of 1610, a letter reached England describing how a fleet sent to
reinforce the colony had been broken up by a storm in the Caribbean; the
ship carrying the new governor had been driven to Bermuda, where the
crew and passengers had wintered. Though the letter was not published at
the time, it circulated in manuscript and inspired at least two
pamphlets about these events. Scholars debate the extent to which
Shakespeare made direct use of these materials, but certain details of
the storm and the island seem to be derived from them. There is no doubt
that the seemingly miraculous survival of the governor’s party and the
fertile environment they discovered in the Bahamas were topics of great
public interest at the time of the play.</p>
<p>The British Empire, the slave trade and the riches of the spice
routes lay in the future. Shakespeare’s play is set in the
Mediterranean, not the Caribbean. Caliban cannot strictly be described
as a native of the island. And yet the play intuits the dynamic of
colonial possession and dispossession with such uncanny power that in
1950 a book by Octave Mannoni called The Psychology of Colonisation
could argue that the process functioned by means of a pair of reciprocal
neuroses: the ‘Prospero complex’ on the part of the colonizer and the
‘Caliban complex’ on that of the colonized. It was in response to
Mannoni that Frantz Fanon wrote Black Skin, White Masks , a book that
did much to shape the intellectual terrain of the ‘post-colonial’ era.
For many Anglophone Caribbean writers of the late twentieth century, The
Tempest , and the figure of Caliban in particular, became a focal point
for discovery of their own literary voices. The play is less a
reflection of imperial history – after all, Prospero is an exile, not a
venturer – than an anticipation of it.</p>
<p>As regular players at royal command performances in the Whitehall
Palace, the King’s Men knew that from the end of 1608 onwards, the
teenage Princess Elizabeth was resident at court. A cultured young woman
who enjoyed music and dancing, she participated in court festivals and
in 1610 danced in a masque called Tethys . Masques – performed by a
mixed cast of royalty, courtiers and professional actors, staged with
spectacular scenery and elaborate music – were the height of fashion at
court in these years. Shakespeare’s friend and rival Ben Jonson, working
in conjunction with the designer Inigo Jones, was carving out a role for
himself as the age’s leading masque-wright. In 1608 he introduced the
‘antimasque’ (or ‘antemasque’), a convention whereby grotesque figures
known as ‘antics’ danced boisterously prior to the graceful and
harmonious masque itself. Shakespeare nods to contemporary fashion by
including a betrothal masque within the action of The Tempest , together
with the antimasque farce of Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo smelling of
horse-piss, stealing clothes from a line and being chased away by dogs.
One almost wonders whether the figure of Prospero is a gentle parody of
Ben Jonson: his theatrical imagination is bound by the classical unities
of time and place (as Jonson’s was) and he stages a court masque (as
Jonson did). Perhaps this is why a few years later, in his Bartholomew
Fair , Jonson parodied The Tempest in return.</p>
<p>Prospero’s Christian language reaches its most sustained pitch in the
epilogue, but his final request is for the indulgence not of God but of
the audience. At the last moment, humanist learning is replaced not by
Christian but by theatrical faith. Because of this it has been possible
for the play to be read, as it so often has been since the Romantic
period, as Shakespeare’s defence of his own dramatic art. Ironically,
though, the play itself is profoundly sceptical of the power of the book
and even of the theatre. The book of art is drowned, whilst the masque
and its players dissolve into vacancy like a ‘baseless fabric’ or a
dream.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Twelve years ago Prospero, the Duke of Milan, was usurped by
his brother, Antonio, with the help of Alonso, King of Naples, and the
King’s brother Sebastian. Prospero and his baby daughter Miranda were
put to sea and landed on a distant island where ever since, by the use
of his magic art, he has ruled over the spirit Ariel and the savage
Caliban. He uses his powers to raise a storm which shipwrecks his
enemies on the island. Alonso searches for his son, Ferdinand, although
fearing him to be drowned. Sebastian plots to kill Alonso and seize the
crown. The drunken butler, Stephano, and the jester, Trinculo, encounter
Caliban and are persuaded by him to kill Prospero so that they can rule
the island. Ferdinand meets Miranda and they fall instantly in love.
Prospero sets heavy tasks to test Ferdinand and, when satisfied,
presents the young couple with a betrothal masque. As Prospero’s plan
draws to its climax, he confronts his enemies and forgives them.
Prospero grants Ariel his freedom and prepares to leave the island for
Milan.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on

<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 80% verse, 20% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: 1611. Performed at court, 1 November 1611; uses source material
not available before autumn 1610.</p>
<p>SOURCES: No known source for main plot, but some details of the
tempest and the island seem to derive from William Strachey, A True
Reportory of the Wreck and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates, Knight
(written 1610, published in Purchas his Pilgrims , 1625) and perhaps
Sylvester Jourdain, A Discovery of the Bermudas (1610) and the Virginia
Company’s pamphlet A True Declaration of the Estate of the Colony in
Virginia (1610); several allusions to Virgil’s Aeneid and Ovid’s
Metamorphoses (most notably the imitation in Act 5 scene 1 of Arthur
Golding’s 1567 translation of Medea’s incantation in Ovid’s 7th book);
Gonzalo’s ‘golden age’ oration in Act 2 scene 1 based closely on Michel
de Montaigne’s essay ‘Of the Cannibals’, translated by John Florio
(1603).</p>
<p>TEXT: First Folio of 1623 is the only early printed text. Based on a
transcript by Ralph Crane, professional scribe working for the King’s
Men. Generally good quality of printing.</p>
