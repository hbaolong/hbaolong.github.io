<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-4">Scene 1 / running scene 4</h4>
<p>Enter the Princess, a Forester [with a bow ], her Ladies [Rosaline,
Maria and Katherine ] and her Lords [Boyet and others ]</p>
<p>PRINCESS Was that the king that spurred his horse so hard</p>
<p>Against the steep uprising of the hill?</p>
<p>BOYET I know not, but I think it was not he.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Whoe’er a was, a 677 showed a mounting 678 mind.</p>
<p>Well, lords, today we shall have our dispatch 679 :</p>
<p>On Saturday we will return to France.</p>
<p>Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush</p>
<p>That we must stand and play the murderer in?</p>
<p>FORESTER Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice 680 ,</p>
<p>A stand 681 where you may make the fairest 682 shoot.</p>
<p>PRINCESS I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,</p>
<p>And thereupon thou speak’st the fairest shoot.</p>
<p>FORESTER Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.</p>
<p>PRINCESS What, what? First praise me and again 683 say no?</p>
<p>O short-lived pride! Not fair? Alack for woe!</p>
<p>FORESTER Yes, madam, fair.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Nay, never paint 684 me now.</p>
<p>Where fair 685 is not, praise cannot mend the brow 686 .</p>
<p>Here, good my glass 687 , take this for telling true:</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>Fair payment for foul words is more than due.</p>
<p>FORESTER Nothing but fair is that which you inherit 688 .</p>
<p>PRINCESS See see, my beauty will be saved by merit 689 .</p>
<p>O heresy in fair 690 , fit for these days!</p>
<p>A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise 691 .</p>
<p>But come, the bow. Now mercy 692 goes to kill,</p>
<p>Takes a bow</p>
<p>And shooting well is then 693 accounted ill.</p>
<p>Thus will I save my credit 694 in the shoot:</p>
<p>Not wounding, pity would not let me do’t 695 .</p>
<p>If wounding, then it was to show my skill,</p>
<p>That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.</p>
<p>And out of 696 question so it is sometimes,</p>
<p>Glory 697 grows guilty of detested crimes,</p>
<p>When for fame’s sake, for praise, an outward part 698 ,</p>
<p>We bend to that the working of the heart.</p>
<p>As 699 I for praise alone now seek to spill</p>
<p>The poor deer’s blood that my heart means no ill 700 .</p>
<p>BOYET Do not curst 701 wives hold that self-sovereignty 702</p>
<p>Only for praise’ sake, when they strive to be</p>
<p>Lords o’er their lords?</p>
<p>PRINCESS Only for praise, and praise we may afford</p>
<p>To any lady that subdues a lord.</p>
<p>Enter Clown [Costard, with a letter ]</p>
<p>BOYET Here comes a member of the commonwealth 703 .</p>
<p>COSTARD God dig-you-den 704 all! Pray you which is the head lady?</p>
<p>PRINCESS Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads
705 .</p>
<p>COSTARD Which is the greatest lady, the highest?</p>
<p>PRINCESS The thickest 706 and the tallest.</p>
<p>COSTARD The thickest and the tallest. It is so, truth is truth.</p>
<p>An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,</p>
<p>One o’these maids’ girdles for your waist should be fit.</p>
<p>Are not you the chief woman? You are the thickest here.</p>
<p>PRINCESS What’s your will, sir? What’s your will?</p>
<p>COSTARD I have a letter from Monsieur Berowne to one Lady
Rosaline.</p>
<p>PRINCESS O, thy letter, thy letter! He’s a good friend of mine.—</p>
<p>To Rosaline</p>
<p>Stand aside, good bearer.— Boyet, you can carve 707 :</p>
<p>Takes the letter and gives it to Boyet</p>
<p>Break up 708 this capon 709 .</p>
<p>BOYET I am bound to serve.</p>
<p>This letter is mistook 710 : it importeth 711 none here.</p>
<p>It is writ to Jaquenetta.</p>
<p>PRINCESS We will read it, I swear.</p>
<p>Break the neck of the wax 712 , and everyone give ear 713 .</p>
<p>BOYET (Reads ) ’By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible 714
: true that thou art beauteous, truth itself that thou art lovely. More
fairer than fair, beautiful than beauteous, truer than truth itself,
have commiseration 715 on thy heroical vassal 716 . The magnanimous and
most illustrate 717 King Cophetua set eye upon the pernicious 718 and
indubitate 719 beggar Zenelophon, and he it was that might rightly say,
Veni , vidi ,vici 720 , which to annothanize 721 in the vulgar 722 , — O
base and obscure vulgar! —videlicet 723 , he came, see 724 and overcame
725 . He came, one; see, two; overcame, three. Who came? The king. Why
did he come? To see. Why did he see? To overcome. To whom came he? To
the beggar. What saw he? The beggar. Who overcame he? The beggar. The
conclusion is victory. On whose side? The king. The captive is enriched.
On whose side? The beggar’s. The catastrophe 726 is a nuptial. On whose
side? The king’s. No, on both in one, or one in both. I am the king, for
so stands the comparison: thou the beggar, for so witnesseth thy
lowliness 727 . Shall I command thy love? I may. Shall I enforce thy
love? I could. Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou
exchange for rags? Robes. For tittles 728 ? Titles. For thyself? Me.
Thus expecting 729 thy reply, I profane 730 my lips on thy foot, my eyes
on thy picture 731 , and my heart on thy every part. Thine, in the
dearest design of industry 732 , Don Adriano de Armado.</p>
<p>Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion 733 roar</p>
<p>Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.</p>
<p>Submissive fall 734 his princely feet before,</p>
<p>And he from forage 735 will incline to play.</p>
<p>But if thou strive 736 , poor soul, what art thou then?</p>
<p>Food for his rage, repasture 737 for his den.’</p>
<p>PRINCESS What plume of feathers 738 is he that indited 739 this
letter?</p>
<p>What vane 740 ? What weathercock? Did you ever hear better?</p>
<p>BOYET I am much deceived but I 741 remember the style.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Else 742 your memory is bad, going o’er 743 it erewhile 744
.</p>
<p>BOYET This Armado is a Spaniard that keeps 745 here in court,</p>
<p>A phantasime 746 , a Monarcho 747 , and one that makes sport</p>
<p>To 748 the prince and his book-mates 749 .</p>
<p>PRINCESS Thou fellow, a word.</p>
<p>To Costard</p>
<p>Who gave thee this letter?</p>
<p>COSTARD I told you: my lord.</p>
<p>PRINCESS To whom shouldst thou give it?</p>
<p>COSTARD From my lord to my lady.</p>
<p>PRINCESS From which lord to which lady?</p>
<p>COSTARD From my lord Berowne, a good master of mine,</p>
<p>To a lady of France that he called Rosaline.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Thou hast mistaken 750 his letter.— Come, lords, away.—</p>
<p>Here, sweet, put up 751 this: ’twill be thine 752 another day.</p>
<p>To Rosaline</p>
<p>Exeunt [all but Boyet, Rosaline, Maria and Costard ]</p>
<p>BOYET Who is the shooter 753 ? Who is the shooter?</p>
<p>ROSALINE Shall I teach you to know?</p>
<p>BOYET Ay, my continent 754 of beauty.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Why, she that bears the bow.</p>
<p>Finely put off 755 !</p>
<p>BOYET My lady goes to kill horns 756 , but if thou marry,</p>
<p>Hang me by the neck, if horns 757 that year miscarry 758 .</p>
<p>Finely put on 759 !</p>
<p>ROSALINE Well, then, I am the shooter.</p>
<p>BOYET And who is your deer 760 ?</p>
<p>ROSALINE If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near 761 .</p>
<p>Finely put on indeed!</p>
<p>MARIA You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes at the brow
762 .</p>
<p>BOYET But she herself is hit lower 763 : have I hit her 764 now?</p>
<p>ROSALINE Shall I come upon 765 thee with an old saying that was a man
766 when King</p>
<p>Pepin 767 of France was a little boy, as touching the hit it 768
?</p>
<p>BOYET So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a woman when
Queen</p>
<p>Guinevere 769 of Britain was a little wench, as touching the hit
it.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,</p>
<p>Thou canst not hit it, my good man.</p>
<p>BOYET I cannot, cannot, cannot,</p>
<p>An 770 I cannot, another can.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Rosaline and Katherine ]</p>
<p>COSTARD By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it 771 !</p>
<p>MARIA A mark 772 marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.</p>
<p>BOYET A mark! O, mark but 773 that mark! A mark, says my lady.</p>
<p>Let the mark 774 have a prick 775 in’t, to mete 776 at, if it may
be.</p>
<p>MARIA Wide o’th’bow hand 777 ! I’faith your hand is out 778 .</p>
<p>COSTARD Indeed, a must shoot 779 nearer, or he’ll ne’er hit the clout
780 .</p>
<p>BOYET An if my hand be out 781 , then belike your hand is in 782
.</p>
<p>COSTARD Then will she get the upshoot 783 by cleaving the pin 784
.</p>
<p>MARIA Come, come, you talk greasily, your lips grow foul.</p>
<p>COSTARD She’s too hard 785 for you at pricks 786 , sir. Challenge her
to bowl 787 .</p>
<p>BOYET I fear too much rubbing 788 . Good night, my good owl 789 .</p>
<p>[Exeunt Boyet and Maria ]</p>
<p>COSTARD By my soul, a swain, a most simple clown 790 !</p>
<p>Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!</p>
<p>O my troth, most sweet jests, most incony 791 vulgar 792 wit,</p>
<p>When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely 793 , as it were, so
fit.</p>
<p>Armado o’th’t’other side — O, a most dainty 794 man!</p>
<p>To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!</p>
<p>To see him kiss his hand, and how most sweetly a will swear!</p>
<p>And his page o’t’other side, that handful of wit!</p>
<p>Ah, heavens, it is most pathetical nit 795 !</p>
<p>Shout within</p>
<p>Sola 796 , sola!</p>
<p>Exit [Costard, running ]</p>
