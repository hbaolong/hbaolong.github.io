<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-3">Scene 1 / running scene 3</h4>
<p>Enter Katherina and Bianca</p>
<p>Bianca’s hands tied</p>
<p>BIANCA Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,</p>
<p>To make a bondmaid 481 and a slave of me.</p>
<p>That I disdain. But for these other goods 482 ,</p>
<p>Unbind 483 my hands, I’ll pull them off myself,</p>
<p>Yea, all my raiment 484 , to my petticoat,</p>
<p>Or what you will command me will I do,</p>
<p>So well I know my duty to my elders.</p>
<p>KATE Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell</p>
<p>Whom thou lov’st best: see thou dissemble 485 not.</p>
<p>BIANCA Believe me, sister, of all the men alive</p>
<p>I never yet beheld that special 486 face</p>
<p>Which I could fancy more than any other.</p>
<p>KATE Minion 487 , thou liest. Is’t not Hortensio?</p>
<p>BIANCA If you affect 488 him, sister, here I swear</p>
<p>I’ll plead for you myself, but you shall have him.</p>
<p>KATE O, then belike you fancy riches more:</p>
<p>You will have Gremio to keep you fair 489 .</p>
<p>BIANCA Is it for him you do envy 490 me so?</p>
<p>Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive</p>
<p>You have but jested with me all this while.</p>
<p>I prithee sister Kate, untie my hands.</p>
<p>KATE If that be jest, then all the rest was so.</p>
<p>Strikes her</p>
<p>Enter Baptista</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Why, how now, dame 491 ? Whence grows this insolence?—</p>
<p>Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl, she weeps.</p>
<p>Go ply thy needle 492 , meddle not 493 with her.—</p>
<p>For shame, thou hilding 494 of a devilish spirit,</p>
<p>Why dost thou wrong her that did ne’er wrong thee?</p>
<p>When did she cross 495 thee with a bitter word?</p>
<p>KATE Her silence flouts 496 me, and I’ll be revenged.</p>
<p>Flies after Bianca</p>
<p>BAPTISTA What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.</p>
<p>Exit [Bianca ]</p>
<p>KATE What, will you not suffer 497 me? Nay, now I see</p>
<p>She is your treasure, she must have a husband,</p>
<p>I must dance barefoot on her wedding day 498 ,</p>
<p>And for your love to her lead apes in hell 499 .</p>
<p>Talk not to me. I will go sit and weep</p>
<p>Till I can find occasion of 500 revenge.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?</p>
<p>But who comes here?</p>
<p>Enter Gremio, Lucentio in the habit 501 of a mean 502 man, Petruchio
with [Hortensio as a musician, and ] Tranio, with his boy [Biondello ]
bearing a lute and books</p>
<p>GREMIO Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.</p>
<p>God save you, gentlemen!</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO And you, good sir. Pray, have you not a daughter</p>
<p>Called Katherina, fair and virtuous?</p>
<p>BAPTISTA I have a daughter, sir, called Katherina.</p>
<p>GREMIO You are too blunt. Go to it orderly 503 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO You wrong me, Signior Gremio, give me leave 504 .—</p>
<p>I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,</p>
<p>To Baptista</p>
<p>That, hearing of her beauty and her wit 505 ,</p>
<p>Her affability and bashful modesty,</p>
<p>Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,</p>
<p>Am bold to show myself a forward 506 guest</p>
<p>Within your house, to make mine eye the witness</p>
<p>Of that report which I so oft have heard.</p>
<p>And for an entrance to my entertainment 507 ,</p>
<p>I do present you with a man of mine,</p>
<p>Presents Hortensio</p>
<p>Cunning in music and the mathematics,</p>
<p>To instruct her fully in those sciences 508 ,</p>
<p>Whereof I know she is not ignorant.</p>
<p>Accept of 509 him, or else you do me wrong.</p>
<p>His name is Litio 510 , born in Mantua 511 .</p>
<p>BAPTISTA You’re welcome, sir, and he, for your good sake.</p>
<p>But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,</p>
<p>She is not for your turn 512 , the more my grief.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO I see you do not mean to part with her,</p>
<p>Or else you like not of my company.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Mistake me not, I speak but as I find.</p>
<p>Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Petruchio is my name, Antonio’s son,</p>
<p>A man well known throughout all Italy.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA I know him well. You are welcome for his sake.</p>
<p>GREMIO Saving 513 your tale, Petruchio, I pray,</p>
<p>Let us that are poor petitioners 514 speak too:</p>
<p>Baccare 515 ! You are marvellous forward.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO O, pardon me, Signior Gremio, I would fain be doing 516
.</p>
<p>GREMIO I doubt it not, sir. But you will curse your wooing.—
Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful 517 , I am sure of it. To
express the like 518 kindness, myself, that have been more kindly 519
beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young scholar, that
hath been long studying at Rheims 520 , as cunning in Greek, Latin, and
other languages, as the other in music and mathematics. His name is
Cambio 521 . Pray, accept his service.</p>
<p>To Baptista</p>
<p>Presents Lucentio</p>
<p>BAPTISTA A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.</p>
<p>Welcome, good Cambio.—</p>
<p>But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger 522 .</p>
<p>To Tranio</p>
<p>May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?</p>
<p>TRANIO Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,</p>
<p>That, being a stranger in this city here,</p>
<p>Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,</p>
<p>Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.</p>
<p>Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,</p>
<p>In the preferment 523 of the eldest sister.</p>
<p>This liberty is all that I request,</p>
<p>That, upon knowledge 524 of my parentage,</p>
<p>I may have welcome ’mongst the rest that woo,</p>
<p>And free access and favour as the rest.</p>
<p>And toward the education of your daughters</p>
<p>I here bestow a simple instrument,</p>
<p>Presents lute and books</p>
<p>And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:</p>
<p>If you accept them, then their worth is great.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Lucentio is your name? 525 Of whence, I pray?</p>
<p>TRANIO Of Pisa, sir, son to Vincentio.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA A mighty 526 man of Pisa. By report</p>
<p>I know him well. You are very welcome, sir.—</p>
<p>To Hortensio and Lucentio</p>
<p>Take you the lute, and you the set of books,</p>
<p>You shall go see your pupils presently 527 .—</p>
<p>Holla 528 , within!</p>
<p>Enter a Servant</p>
<p>Sirrah, lead these gentlemen</p>
<p>To my daughters, and tell them both</p>
<p>These are their tutors: bid them use them well.</p>
<p>[Exit Servant, with Lucentio and Hortensio, Biondello following ]</p>
<p>We will go walk a little in the orchard 529 ,</p>
<p>And then to dinner 530 . You are passing 531 welcome,</p>
<p>And so I pray you all to think yourselves.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste 532 ,</p>
<p>And every day I cannot come to woo.</p>
<p>You knew my father well, and in him me,</p>
<p>Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,</p>
<p>Which I have bettered rather than decreased.</p>
<p>Then tell me, if I get your daughter’s love,</p>
<p>What dowry shall I have with her to wife?</p>
<p>BAPTISTA After my death the one half of my lands,</p>
<p>And in possession 533 twenty thousand crowns.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO And for that dowry I’ll assure her of</p>
<p>Her widowhood 534 , be it that she survive me,</p>
<p>In all my lands and leases 535 whatsoever.</p>
<p>Let specialties 536 be therefore drawn between us,</p>
<p>That covenants 537 may be kept on either hand.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Ay, when the special 538 thing is well obtained,</p>
<p>That is, her love, for that is all in all.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Why, that is nothing, for I tell you, father 539 ,</p>
<p>I am as peremptory as she proud-minded.</p>
<p>And where two raging fires meet together</p>
<p>They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.</p>
<p>Though little fire grows great with little wind,</p>
<p>Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:</p>
<p>So I 540 to her and so she yields to me,</p>
<p>For I am rough and woo not like a babe.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed 541 !</p>
<p>But be thou armed for some unhappy words.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Ay, to the proof 542 , as mountains are for winds,</p>
<p>That shakes not, though they blow perpetually.</p>
<p>Enter Hortensio [disguised as Litio ], with his head broke 543</p>
<p>BAPTISTA How now, my friend? Why dost thou look so pale?</p>
<p>HORTENSIO For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA What, will my daughter prove a good musician?</p>
<p>HORTENSIO I think she’ll sooner prove 544 a soldier.</p>
<p>Iron may hold with 545 her, but never lutes.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Why, then thou canst not break her to 546 the lute?</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Why, no, for she hath broke the lute to me 547 .</p>
<p>I did but tell her she mistook her frets 548 ,</p>
<p>And bowed her hand to teach her fingering,</p>
<p>When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,</p>
<p>‘Frets, call you these?’ quoth she, ‘I’ll fume 549 with them.’</p>
<p>And with that word, she struck me on the head,</p>
<p>And through the instrument my pate 550 made way,</p>
<p>And there I stood amazèd 551 for a while,</p>
<p>As on a pillory 552 , looking through the lute,</p>
<p>While she did call me rascal fiddler 553</p>
<p>And twangling Jack 554 , with twenty such vile terms,</p>
<p>As had she studied 555 to misuse me so.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Now, by the world, it is a lusty 556 wench.</p>
<p>I love her ten times more than e’er I did.</p>
<p>O, how I long to have some chat with her!</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Well, go with me and be not so discomfited 557 .</p>
<p>To Hortensio</p>
<p>Proceed in practice 558 with my younger daughter,</p>
<p>She’s apt to learn and thankful for good turns.</p>
<p>Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,</p>
<p>Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO I pray you do.</p>
<p>Exeunt all but Petruchio</p>
<p>I’ll attend 559 her here,</p>
<p>And woo her with some spirit when she comes.</p>
<p>Say that she rail, why then I’ll tell her plain</p>
<p>She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:</p>
<p>Say that she frown, I’ll say she looks as clear 560</p>
<p>As morning roses newly washed with dew:</p>
<p>Say she be mute and will not speak a word,</p>
<p>Then I’ll commend her volubility,</p>
<p>And say she uttereth piercing 561 eloquence:</p>
<p>If she do bid me pack 562 , I’ll give her thanks,</p>
<p>As though she bid me stay by her a week:</p>
<p>If she deny to wed, I’ll crave 563 the day</p>
<p>When I shall ask the banns 564 and when be married.</p>
<p>But here she comes, and now, Petruchio, speak.</p>
<p>Enter Katherina</p>
<p>Good morrow, Kate, for that’s your name, I hear.</p>
<p>KATE Well have you heard, but something hard 565 of hearing:</p>
<p>They call me Katherine that do talk of me.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO You lie, in faith, for you are called plain Kate,</p>
<p>And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst,</p>
<p>But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,</p>
<p>Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,</p>
<p>For dainties are all Kates 566 , and therefore, Kate,</p>
<p>Take this of 567 me, Kate of my consolation,</p>
<p>Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,</p>
<p>Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded 568 ,</p>
<p>Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs 569 ,</p>
<p>Myself am moved 570 to woo thee for my wife.</p>
<p>KATE Moved? In good time! 571 Let him that moved you hither</p>
<p>Remove you hence. I knew you at the first 572</p>
<p>You were a movable 573 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Why, what’s a movable?</p>
<p>KATE A joint stool 574 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me 575 .</p>
<p>KATE Asses 576 are made to bear 577 , and so are you.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Women are made to bear, and so are you.</p>
<p>KATE No such jade as you, if me you mean.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Alas, good Kate, I will not burden 578 thee,</p>
<p>For knowing thee to be but young and light 579 —</p>
<p>KATE Too light 580 for such a swain 581 as you to catch,</p>
<p>And yet as heavy as my weight should be 582 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Should be 583 ? Should — buzz 584 !</p>
<p>KATE Well ta’en 585 , and like a buzzard 586 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO O slow-winged turtle 587 , shall a buzzard 588 take
thee?</p>
<p>KATE Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Come, come, you wasp, i’faith, you are too angry.</p>
<p>KATE If I be waspish 589 , best beware my sting 590 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO My remedy is then to pluck it out.</p>
<p>KATE Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his
tail.</p>
<p>KATE In his tongue.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Whose tongue?</p>
<p>KATE Yours, if you talk of tails 591 , and so farewell.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO What, with my tongue in your tail 592 ? Nay, come 593 again
594 .</p>
<p>Good Kate, I am a gentleman.</p>
<p>KATE That I’ll try 595 .</p>
<p>She strikes him</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO I swear I’ll cuff 596 you, if you strike again.</p>
<p>KATE So may you lose your arms 597 :</p>
<p>If you strike 598 me, you are no gentleman,</p>
<p>And if no gentleman, why then no arms.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books 599 !</p>
<p>KATE What is your crest 600 , a coxcomb 601 ?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO A combless 602 cock 603 , so 604 Kate will be my hen 605
.</p>
<p>KATE No cock of mine, you crow too like a craven 606 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Nay, come, Kate, come, you must not look so sour.</p>
<p>KATE It is my fashion 607 , when I see a crab 608 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Why, here’s no crab, and therefore look not sour.</p>
<p>KATE There is, there is.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Then show it me.</p>
<p>KATE Had I a glass 609 , I would.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO What, you mean my face?</p>
<p>KATE Well aimed of such a young one 610 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Now, by Saint George, I am too young 611 for you.</p>
<p>KATE Yet you are withered.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO ’Tis with cares 612 .</p>
<p>KATE I care not.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Nay, hear you, Kate. In sooth you scape 613 not so.</p>
<p>KATE I chafe 614 you, if I tarry. Let me go.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO No, not a whit. I find you passing gentle.</p>
<p>’Twas told me you were rough 615 and coy 616 and sullen,</p>
<p>And now I find report a very liar,</p>
<p>For thou are pleasant 617 , gamesome 618 , passing courteous,</p>
<p>But slow 619 in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers.</p>
<p>Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance 620 ,</p>
<p>Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,</p>
<p>Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross 621 in talk.</p>
<p>But thou with mildness entertain’st 622 thy wooers,</p>
<p>With gentle conference 623 , soft and affable.</p>
<p>Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?</p>
<p>Kicks her?</p>
<p>O sland’rous world! Kate like the hazel twig</p>
<p>Is straight and slender and as brown in hue</p>
<p>As hazelnuts and sweeter than the kernels.</p>
<p>O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt 624 .</p>
<p>KATE Go, fool, and whom thou keep’st command 625 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Did ever Dian 626 so become 627 a grove</p>
<p>As Kate this chamber with her princely gait 628 ?</p>
<p>O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate,</p>
<p>And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful 629 !</p>
<p>KATE Where did you study 630 all this goodly 631 speech?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO It is extempore 632 , from my mother-wit 633 .</p>
<p>KATE A witty mother, witless else her son 634 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Am I not wise?</p>
<p>KATE Yes, keep you warm 635 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Marry, so I mean 636 , sweet Katherine, in thy bed.</p>
<p>And therefore, setting all this chat aside,</p>
<p>Thus in plain terms: you 637 r father hath consented</p>
<p>That you shall be my wife; your dowry ’greed on,</p>
<p>And, will you, nill you, I will marry you.</p>
<p>Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn 638 ,</p>
<p>For by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,</p>
<p>Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,</p>
<p>Thou must be married to no man but me,</p>
<p>Enter Baptista, Gremio, Tranio [disguised as Lucentio ]</p>
<p>For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,</p>
<p>And bring you from a wild Kate 639 to a Kate</p>
<p>Conformable 640 as other household Kates.</p>
<p>Here comes your father. Never make denial 641 ,</p>
<p>I must and will have Katherine to my wife.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you 642 with my
daughter?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO How but well, sir? How but well?</p>
<p>It were impossible I should speed amiss 643 .</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Why, how now, daughter Katherine? In your dumps? 644</p>
<p>KATE Call you me ‘daughter’? Now, I promise you</p>
<p>You have showed a tender fatherly regard,</p>
<p>To wish me wed to one half-lunatic,</p>
<p>A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack</p>
<p>That thinks with oaths to face the matter out 645 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Father, ’tis thus: yourself and all the world</p>
<p>That talked of her, have talked amiss of her:</p>
<p>If she be curst, it is for policy 646 ,</p>
<p>For she’s not froward, but modest as the dove,</p>
<p>She is not hot, but temperate 647 as the morn,</p>
<p>For patience she will prove a second Grissel 648 ,</p>
<p>And Roman Lucrece 649 for her chastity.</p>
<p>And to conclude, we have ’greed 650 so well together</p>
<p>That upon Sunday is the wedding day.</p>
<p>KATE I’ll see thee hanged on Sunday first.</p>
<p>GREMIO Hark, Petruchio, she says she’ll see thee hanged first.</p>
<p>TRANIO Is this your speeding 651 ? Nay then, goodnight our part 652
!</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Be patient, gentlemen, I choose her for myself.</p>
<p>If she and I be pleased, what’s that to you?</p>
<p>’Tis bargained ’twixt us twain 653 , being alone,</p>
<p>That she shall still be curst in company.</p>
<p>I tell you, ’tis incredible to believe</p>
<p>How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!</p>
<p>She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss</p>
<p>She vied 654 so fast, protesting 655 oath on oath,</p>
<p>That in a twink 656 she won me to her love.</p>
<p>O, you are novices! ’Tis a world to see 657</p>
<p>How tame, when men and women are alone,</p>
<p>A meacock 658 wretch can make the curstest shrew.</p>
<p>Give me thy hand, Kate. I will unto Venice</p>
<p>To buy apparel ’gainst 659 the wedding day;</p>
<p>Provide the feast, father, and bid 660 the guests.</p>
<p>I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine 661 .</p>
<p>BAPTISTA I know not what to say, but give me your hands.</p>
<p>God send you joy, Petruchio! ’Tis a match.</p>
<p>GREMIO and TRANIO Amen, say we. We will be witnesses 662 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.</p>
<p>I will to Venice. Sunday comes apace 663 .</p>
<p>We will have rings and things and fine array,</p>
<p>And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o’Sunday.</p>
<p>Exeunt Petruchio and Katherine [separately ]</p>
<p>GREMIO Was ever match clapped up 664 so suddenly?</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant’s part,</p>
<p>And venture madly on a desperate mart 665 .</p>
<p>TRANIO ’Twas a commodity lay fretting by you 666 :</p>
<p>’Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA The gain I seek is quiet 667 in the match.</p>
<p>GREMIO No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch 668 .</p>
<p>But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter.</p>
<p>Now is the day we long have lookèd for.</p>
<p>I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.</p>
<p>TRANIO And I am one that love Bianca more</p>
<p>Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.</p>
<p>GREMIO Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.</p>
<p>TRANIO Greybeard, thy love doth freeze 669 .</p>
<p>GREMIO But thine doth fry 670 .</p>
<p>Skipper 671 , stand back, ’tis age that nourisheth 672 .</p>
<p>TRANIO But youth in ladies’ eyes that flourisheth.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Content you, gentlemen, I will compound 673 this strife.</p>
<p>’Tis deeds 674 must win the prize, and he of both 675</p>
<p>That can assure my daughter greatest dower 676</p>
<p>Shall have my Bianca’s love.</p>
<p>Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?</p>
<p>GREMIO First, as you know, my house within the city</p>
<p>Is richly furnishèd with plate 677 and gold,</p>
<p>Basins and ewers to lave 678 her dainty hands:</p>
<p>My hangings 679 all of Tyrian 680 tapestry:</p>
<p>In ivory coffers 681 I have stuffed my crowns:</p>
<p>In cypress 682 chests my arras counterpoints 683 ,</p>
<p>Costly apparel, tents 684 , and canopies,</p>
<p>Fine linen, Turkey 685 cushions bossed 686 with pearl,</p>
<p>Valance of Venice gold in needlework 687 :</p>
<p>Pewter and brass and all things that belongs</p>
<p>To house or housekeeping. Then, at my farm</p>
<p>I have a hundred milch-kine 688 to the pail 689 ,</p>
<p>Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,</p>
<p>And all things answerable to this portion 690 .</p>
<p>Myself am struck 691 in years, I must confess,</p>
<p>And if I die tomorrow, this is hers,</p>
<p>If whilst I live she will be only mine.</p>
<p>TRANIO That ‘only’ came well in 692 . Sir, list 693 to me:</p>
<p>I am my father’s heir and only son.</p>
<p>If I may have your daughter to my wife,</p>
<p>I’ll leave her houses three or four as good,</p>
<p>Within rich Pisa walls 694 , as any one</p>
<p>Old Signior Gremio has in Padua,</p>
<p>Besides two thousand ducats by the year</p>
<p>Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure 695 .</p>
<p>What, have I pinched 696 you, Signior Gremio?</p>
<p>GREMIO Two thousand ducats by the year of land 697 ?</p>
<p>My land amounts not to so much in all.—</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>That she shall have, besides an argosy 698</p>
<p>That now is lying in Marseillis’ road 699 .</p>
<p>What, have I choked you with an argosy?</p>
<p>To Tranio</p>
<p>TRANIO Gremio, ’tis known my father hath no less</p>
<p>Than three great argosies, besides two galliases 700 ,</p>
<p>And twelve tight 701 galleys. These I will assure her,</p>
<p>And twice as much, whate’er thou offer’st next.</p>
<p>GREMIO Nay, I have offered all, I have no more,</p>
<p>And she can have no more than all I have.</p>
<p>If you like me, she shall have me and mine.</p>
<p>To Baptista</p>
<p>TRANIO Why then the maid is mine from all the world,</p>
<p>By your firm promise. Gremio is out-vied 702 .</p>
<p>BAPTISTA I must confess your offer is the best,</p>
<p>And let 703 your father make her the assurance 704 ,</p>
<p>She is your own, else 705 , you must pardon me.</p>
<p>If you should die before him, where’s her dower?</p>
<p>TRANIO That’s but a cavil 706 . He is old, I young.</p>
<p>GREMIO And may not young men die, as well as old?</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Well, gentlemen,</p>
<p>I am thus resolved: on Sunday next, you know</p>
<p>My daughter Katherine is to be married.</p>
<p>Now on the Sunday following, shall Bianca</p>
<p>Be bride to you, if you make this assurance.</p>
<p>If not, to Signior Gremio.</p>
<p>And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>GREMIO Adieu, good neighbour.— Now I fear thee not.</p>
<p>Sirrah young gamester 707 , your father were 708 a fool</p>
<p>To give thee all, and in his waning age</p>
<p>Set foot under thy table 709 . Tut, a toy 710 !</p>
<p>An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>TRANIO A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!</p>
<p>Yet I have faced it with a card of ten 711 .</p>
<p>’Tis in my head 712 to do my master good:</p>
<p>I see no reason but supposed Lucentio</p>
<p>Must get 713 a father, called ‘supposed Vincentio’,</p>
<p>And that’s a wonder. Fathers commonly</p>
<p>Do get their children, but in this case of wooing,</p>
<p>A child shall get a sire 714 , if I fail not of my cunning.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
