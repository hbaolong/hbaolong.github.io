13</h4>
<p>Enter Queen and Horatio</p>
<p>GERTRUDE I will not speak with her.</p>
<p>HORATIO She is importunate 1382 , indeed distract 1383 :</p>
<p>Her mood will needs be pitied.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE What would she have?</p>
<p>HORATIO She speaks much of her father; says she hears</p>
<p>There’s tricks i’th’world, and hems 1384 , and beats her heart,</p>
<p>Spurns enviously at straws 1385 , speaks things in doubt 1386</p>
<p>That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,</p>
<p>Yet the unshapèd use 1387 of it doth move</p>
<p>The hearers to collection 1388 ; they aim 1389 at it,</p>
<p>And botch 1390 the words up fit to their own thoughts,</p>
<p>Which 1391 , as her winks and nods and gestures yield 1392 them,</p>
<p>Indeed would make one think there might be thought 1393 ,</p>
<p>Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily 1394 .</p>
<p>GERTRUDE ’Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew</p>
<p>Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding 1395 minds.</p>
<p>Let her come in.</p>
<p>Horatio goes to the door or may exit</p>
<p>To my sick soul — as sin’s true nature is —</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Each toy 1396 seems prologue to some great amiss 1397 :</p>
<p>So full of artless jealousy 1398 is guilt,</p>
<p>It spills itself in fearing to be spilt 1399 .</p>
<p>Enter Ophelia, distracted</p>
<p>With Horatio?</p>
<p>OPHELIA Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE How now, Ophelia!</p>
<p>OPHELIA How should I your true love know</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>From another one?</p>
<p>By his cockle hat 1400 and staff,</p>
<p>And his sandal shoon 1401 .</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?</p>
<p>OPHELIA Say you? Nay, pray you, mark.</p>
<p>He is dead and gone, lady,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>He is dead and gone.</p>
<p>At his head a grass-green turf,</p>
<p>At his heels a stone.</p>
<p>Enter King</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Nay, but, Ophelia—</p>
<p>OPHELIA Pray you, mark.</p>
<p>White his shroud as the mountain snow—</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Alas, look here, my lord.</p>
<p>OPHELIA Larded 1402 with sweet flowers</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Which bewept to the grave did not go</p>
<p>With true-love showers 1403 .</p>
<p>KING How do ye, pretty lady?</p>
<p>OPHELIA Well, God yield 1404 you! They say the owl was a baker’s
daughter 1405 . Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be.
God be at your table!</p>
<p>KING Conceit upon 1406 her father.</p>
<p>OPHELIA Pray you let’s have no words of this, but when they ask you
what it means, say you this:</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>All in the morning betime 1407 ,</p>
<p>And I a maid at your window,</p>
<p>To be your Valentine 1408 .</p>
<p>Then up he rose 1409 , and donned his clothes,</p>
<p>And dupped 1410 the chamber door 1411 :</p>
<p>Let in the maid 1412 , that out a maid</p>
<p>Never departed more.</p>
<p>KING Pretty Ophelia.</p>
<p>OPHELIA Indeed, la, without an oath, I’ll make an end on’t:</p>
<p>By Gis 1413 and by Saint Charity,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Alack, and fie for shame!</p>
<p>Young men will do’t 1414 , if they come to’t,</p>
<p>By cock 1415 , they are to blame.</p>
<p>Quoth she, ’Before you tumbled 1416 me,</p>
<p>You promised me to wed.’</p>
<p>‘So would I ha’ done, by yonder sun,</p>
<p>An 1417 thou hadst not come to my bed.’</p>
<p>KING How long hath she been thus?</p>
<p>OPHELIA I hope all will be well. We must be patient, but I cannot
choose but weep to think they should lay him i’th’cold ground. My
brother shall know of it: and so I thank you for your good counsel.
Come, my coach! Goodnight, ladies, goodnight, sweet ladies, goodnight,
goodnight.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KING Follow her close: give her good watch, I pray you.</p>
<p>To Horatio</p>
<p>[Exit Horatio]</p>
<p>O, this is the poison of deep grief: it springs</p>
<p>All from her father’s death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,</p>
<p>When sorrows come, they come not single spies 1418</p>
<p>But in battalions. First, her father slain:</p>
<p>Next, your son gone, and he most violent author</p>
<p>Of his own just remove 1419 : the people muddied 1420 ,</p>
<p>Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers</p>
<p>For good Polonius’ death, and we have done but greenly 1421</p>
<p>In hugger-mugger 1422 to inter him: poor Ophelia</p>
<p>Divided from herself and her fair judgement,</p>
<p>Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts:</p>
<p>Last, and as much containing 1423 as all these,</p>
<p>Her brother is in secret come from France,</p>
<p>Feeds on his wonder 1424 , keeps himself in clouds 1425 ,</p>
<p>And wants 1426 not buzzers 1427 to infect his ear</p>
<p>With pestilent speeches of his father’s death,</p>
<p>Wherein necessity, of matter beggared 1428 ,</p>
<p>Will nothing stick our persons to arraign</p>
<p>In ear 1429 and ear. O, my dear Gertrude, this,</p>
<p>Like to a murdering-piece 1430 , in many places</p>
<p>Gives me superfluous death 1431 .</p>
<p>A noise within</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Alack, what noise is this?</p>
<p>KING Where are my Switzers 1432 ? Let them guard the door.—</p>
<p>What is the matter?</p>
<p>MESSENGER Save yourself, my lord.</p>
<p>The ocean, overpeering of his list 1433 ,</p>
<p>Eats not the flats 1434 with more impiteous haste</p>
<p>Than young Laertes, in a riotous head 1435 ,</p>
<p>O’erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord,</p>
<p>And, as 1436 the world were now but to begin,</p>
<p>Antiquity 1437 forgot, custom not known,</p>
<p>The ratifiers and props of every word 1438 ,</p>
<p>They cry ‘Choose we! Laertes shall be king.’</p>
<p>Caps 1439 , hands and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:</p>
<p>‘Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!’</p>
<p>GERTRUDE How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!</p>
<p>O, this is counter 1440 , you false 1441 Danish dogs!</p>
<p>Noise within</p>
<p>Enter Laertes</p>
<p>His followers remain at the door</p>
<p>KING The doors are broke.</p>
<p>LAERTES Where is the king?— Sirs, stand you all without 1442 .</p>
<p>ALL FOLLOWERS No, let’s come in.</p>
<p>At the door</p>
<p>LAERTES I pray you give me leave.</p>
<p>ALL We will, we will.</p>
<p>LAERTES I thank you: keep 1443 the door.— O thou vile king,</p>
<p>Give me my father!</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Calmly, good Laertes.</p>
<p>Restrains him or blocks his way</p>
<p>LAERTES That drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard,</p>
<p>Cries cuckold 1444 to my father, brands the harlot</p>
<p>Even here, between 1445 the chaste unsmirchèd 1446 brow</p>
<p>Of my true 1447 mother.</p>
<p>KING What is the cause, Laertes,</p>
<p>That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?—</p>
<p>Let him go, Gertrude: do not fear 1448 our person:</p>
<p>There’s such divinity doth hedge 1449 a king</p>
<p>That treason can but peep to what it would,</p>
<p>Acts little of his will 1450 .— Tell me, Laertes,</p>
<p>Why thou art thus incensed.— Let him go, Gertrude.—</p>
<p>Speak, man.</p>
<p>LAERTES Where’s my father?</p>
<p>KING Dead.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE But not by him.</p>
<p>KING Let him demand his fill.</p>
<p>LAERTES How came he dead? I’ll not be juggled with 1451 :</p>
<p>To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil!</p>
<p>Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!</p>
<p>I dare damnation. To this point I stand 1452 ,</p>
<p>That both the worlds I give to negligence 1453 ,</p>
<p>Let come what comes, only I’ll be revenged</p>
<p>Most throughly 1454 for my father.</p>
<p>KING Who shall stay 1455 you?</p>
<p>LAERTES My will, not all the world 1456 :</p>
<p>And for my means, I’ll husband 1457 them so well,</p>
<p>They shall go far with little.</p>
<p>KING Good Laertes,</p>
<p>If you desire to know the certainty</p>
<p>Of your dear father’s death, is’t writ in your revenge,</p>
<p>That, sweepstake 1458 , you will draw 1459 both friend and foe,</p>
<p>Winner and loser?</p>
<p>LAERTES None but his enemies.</p>
<p>KING Will you know them then?</p>
<p>LAERTES To his good friends thus wide I’ll ope my arms,</p>
<p>And like the kind life-rend’ring pelican 1460 ,</p>
<p>Repast 1461 them with my blood.</p>
<p>KING Why, now you speak</p>
<p>Like a good child and a true gentleman.</p>
<p>That I am guiltless of your father’s death,</p>
<p>And am most sensible 1462 in grief for it,</p>
<p>It shall as level 1463 to your judgement pierce</p>
<p>As day does to your eye.</p>
<p>A noise within</p>
<p>ALL FOLLOWERS Let her come in!</p>
<p>Enter Ophelia</p>
<p>LAERTES How now? What noise is that?</p>
<p>O, heat dry up my brains, tears seven times salt</p>
<p>Sees Ophelia</p>
<p>Burn out the sense and virtue 1464 of mine eye!</p>
<p>By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,</p>
<p>Till our scale turns the beam 1465 . O rose of May,</p>
<p>Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!</p>
<p>O heavens, is’t possible a young maid’s wits</p>
<p>Should be as mortal as an old man’s life?</p>
<p>Nature 1466 is fine in 1467 love, and where ’tis fine,</p>
<p>It sends some precious instance 1468 of itself</p>
<p>After the thing it loves 1469 .</p>
<p>OPHELIA They bore him barefaced on the bier 1470 ,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Hey non nonny 1471 , nonny, hey nonny,</p>
<p>And on his grave rains many a tear—</p>
<p>Fare you well, my dove.</p>
<p>LAERTES Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge,</p>
<p>It could not move 1472 thus 1473 .</p>
<p>OPHELIA You 1474 must sing ‘a-down a-down’, and you call him
‘a-down-a’ 1475 . O, how the wheel 1476 becomes it! It is the false
steward that stole his master’s daughter 1477 .</p>
<p>LAERTES This nothing’s more than matter 1478 .</p>
<p>OPHELIA There’s rosemary 1479 , that’s for remembrance: pray, love,
remember: and there is pansies 1480 , that’s for thoughts.</p>
<p>Gives real or imaginary flowers</p>
<p>LAERTES A document 1481 in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted
1482 .</p>
<p>OPHELIA There’s fennel 1483 for you, and columbines 1484 : there’s
rue 1485 for you, and here’s some for me: we may call it herb-grace
o’Sundays 1486 : O, you must wear your rue with a difference 1487 .
There’s a daisy 1488 : I would give you some violets 1489 , but they
withered all when my father died: they say he made a good end—</p>
<p>For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy 1490 .</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>LAERTES Thought 1491 and affliction, passion 1492 , hell itself,</p>
<p>She turns to favour 1493 and to prettiness.</p>
<p>OPHELIA And will he not come again?</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>And will he not come again?</p>
<p>No, no, he is dead:</p>
<p>Go to thy death-bed,</p>
<p>He never will come again.</p>
<p>His beard as white as snow,</p>
<p>All flaxen 1494 was his poll 1495 :</p>
<p>He is gone, he is gone,</p>
<p>And we cast away moan 1496 .</p>
<p>Gramercy 1497 on his soul!</p>
<p>And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God buy ye 1498 .</p>
<p>Exeunt Ophelia [and Gertrude?]</p>
<p>LAERTES Do you see this, you gods?</p>
<p>KING Laertes, I must commune with your grief,</p>
<p>Or you deny me right. Go but apart,</p>
<p>Make choice of whom 1499 your wisest friends you will,</p>
<p>And they shall hear and judge ’twixt 1500 you and me:</p>
<p>If by direct or by collateral 1501 hand</p>
<p>They find us touched 1502 , we will our kingdom give,</p>
<p>Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours</p>
<p>To you in satisfaction. But if not,</p>
<p>Be you content to lend your patience to us,</p>
<p>And we shall jointly labour with your soul</p>
<p>To give it due content.</p>
<p>LAERTES Let this be so:</p>
<p>His means of death, his obscure burial —</p>
<p>No trophy 1503 , sword, nor hatchment 1504 o’er his bones,</p>
<p>No noble rite nor formal ostentation 1505 —</p>
<p>Cry to be heard, as ’twere from heaven to earth,</p>
<p>That 1506 I must call in question 1507 .</p>
<p>KING So you shall,</p>
<p>And where th’offence is, let the great axe fall.</p>
<p>I pray you go with me.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
