<h4 id="scene-2-89-running-scene-2">Scene 2 89 / running scene 2</h4>
<p>Enter Henry, Prince of Wales [and ] Sir John Falstaff</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Thou art so fat-witted 90 with drinking of old sack 91
and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon benches in the
afternoon, that thou hast forgotten 92 to demand that truly 93 which
thou wouldst truly 94 know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time
of the day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes capons 95 and
clocks the tongues of bawds 96 and dials 97 the signs of leaping-houses
98 and the blessed sun himself a fair hot 99 wench in flame-coloured
taffeta 100 , I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous 101 to
demand the time of the day.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Indeed, you come near me 102 now, Hal, for we that take
purses go by 103 104 the moon and seven stars, and not by Phoebus 105 ,
he, ‘that wand’ring knight so fair’ 106 . And, I prithee, sweet wag 107
, when thou art king, as God save thy grace 108 — majesty I should say,
for grace thou wilt have none—</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What, none?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF No, not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and
butter 109 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Well, how then? Come, roundly 110 , roundly.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Marry 111 , then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us
that are squires of the night’s body 112 be called thieves of the day’s
beauty 113 . Let us be Diana 114 ’s foresters 115 , gentlemen of the
shade, minions 116 of the moon; and let men say we be men of good
government 117 , being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and chaste
mistress the moon, under whose countenance 118 we steal 119 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Thou say’st well, and it holds 120 well too, for the
fortune of us that are the moon’s men doth ebb and flow like the sea,
being governed, as the sea is, by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse
of gold most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most dissolutely
spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing ‘Lay by’ 121 and spent with
crying ‘Bring in’ 122 , now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows 123 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Thou say’st true, lad. And is not my hostess 124 of the
tavern a most sweet wench?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY As is the honey of Hybla 125 , my old lad of the castle
126 . And is not a buff jerkin 127 a most sweet robe of durance 128
?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF How now, how now, mad wag? What, in thy quips and thy
quiddities 129 ? What a plague 130 have I to do with a buff jerkin?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Why, what a pox 131 have I to do with my hostess of the
tavern?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well, thou hast called her to a reck’ning 132 many a time
and oft.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part 133 ?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF No, I’ll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch 134
, and where it would not, I have used my credit.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Yea, and so used it that were it here apparent that thou art
heir 135 apparent —but, I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows
standing in England when thou art king? And resolution 136 thus fobbed
137 as it is with the rusty curb 138 of old father 139 antic the law? Do
not thou, when thou art a king, hang a thief.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY No, thou shalt.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Shall I? O rare 140 ! I’ll be a brave 141 judge.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have the
hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my humour
142 as well as waiting 143 in the court, I can tell you.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY For obtaining of suits 144 ?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no
lean 145 wardrobe. I am as melancholy as a gib cat 146 or a lugged bear
147 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Or an old lion, or a lover’s lute 148 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe 149 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What say’st thou to a hare 150 , or the melancholy of
Moorditch 151 ?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed the most
comparative 152 , rascalli’st 153 , sweet young prince. But, Hal, I
prithee trouble me no more with vanity 154 . I would thou and I knew
where a commodity 155 of good names 156 were to be bought. An old lord
of the council rated 157 me the other day in the street about you, sir,
but I marked him not 158 . And yet he talked very wisely, but I regarded
him not; and yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Thou didst well, for no man regards it 159 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF O, thou hast damnable iteration 160 and art indeed able to
corrupt a saint 161 . Thou hast done much harm unto me, Hal, God forgive
thee for it! Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing. And now I am, if a
man should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must
give over this life, and I will give it over. An 162 I do not, I am a
villain. I’ll be damned for never a 163 king’s son in Christendom.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack 164 ?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Where thou wilt, lad, I’ll make one 165 . An I do not, call
me villain and baffle 166 me.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I see a good amendment 167 of life in thee, from praying
to purse-taking.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Why, Hal, ‘tis my vocation 168 , Hal: ’tis no sin for a man
to labour in his vocation. Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill 169 have
set a watch 170 . O, if men were to be saved by merit 171 , what hole in
hell were hot enough for him? This is the most omnipotent 172 villain
that ever cried ’Stand’ 173 to a true 174 man.</p>
<p>[Enter Poins ]</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Good morrow, Ned.</p>
<p>POINS Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse 175 ? What
says Sir John Sack and Sugar, Jack 176 ? How agrees the devil and thee
about thy soul, that thou soldest him on Good Friday 177 last for a cup
of Madeira 178 and a cold capon’s leg?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have his
bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs: he will give the
devil his due 179 .</p>
<p>POINS Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Else he had 180 been damned for cozening 181 the
devil.</p>
<p>POINS But, my lads, my lads, tomorrow morning, by four o’clock, early
at Gad’s Hill 182 , there are pilgrims going to Canterbury with rich
offerings, and traders riding to London with fat purses. I have vizards
183 for you all; you have horses for yourselves. Gadshill lies 184
tonight in Rochester. I have bespoke 185 supper tomorrow in Eastcheap
186 ; we may do it as secure 187 as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
your purses full of crowns 188 : if you will not, tarry 189 at home and
be hanged.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Hear ye, Yedward 190 , if I tarry at home and go not, I’ll
hang you 191 for going.</p>
<p>POINS You will, chops 192 ?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Hal, wilt thou make one?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Who, I rob? I a thief? Not I.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF There’s neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in
thee, nor thou cam’st not of the blood royal 193 , if thou dar’st not
stand for 194 ten shillings.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Well then, once in my days I’ll be a madcap.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Why, that’s well said.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Well, come what will, I’ll tarry at home.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I’ll be a traitor then, when thou art king.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I care not.</p>
<p>POINS Sir John, I prithee leave the prince and me alone: I will lay
him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well, mayst thou have the spirit of persuasion and he the
ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may move and what he hears
may be believed 195 , that the true prince may, for recreation sake,
prove a false thief; for the poor abuses 196 of the time want
countenance 197 . Farewell. You shall find me in Eastcheap.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Farewell, the latter spring! Farewell, All-hallown
summer 198 !</p>
<p>[Exit Falstaff ]</p>
<p>POINS Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us tomorrow. I have a
jest to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff, Peto, Bardolph and
Gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid 199 : yourself
and I will not be there. And when they have the booty, if you and I do
not rob them, cut this head from my shoulders.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY But how shall we part with them in setting forth?</p>
<p>POINS Why, we will set forth before or after them, and appoint them a
place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure 200 to fail 201 ; and
then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves, which they shall
have no sooner achieved, but we’ll set upon them.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Ay, but ’tis like 202 that they will know us by our
horses, by our habits 203 and by every other appointment 204 , to be
ourselves.</p>
<p>POINS Tut! Our horses they shall not see: I’ll tie them in the wood.
Our vizards we will change after we leave them. And, sirrah 205 , I have
cases of buckram 206 for the nonce 207 , to immask 208 our noted 209
outward garments.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY But I doubt 210 they will be too hard 211 for us.</p>
<p>POINS Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred cowards
as ever turned back 212 . And for the third, if he fight longer than he
sees reason, I’ll forswear 213 arms. The virtue of this jest will be the
incomprehensible 214 lies that this fat rogue will tell us when we meet
at supper: how thirty at least he fought with, what wards 215 , what
blows, what extremities he endured; and in the reproof 216 of this lies
the jest.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Well, I’ll go with thee. Provide us all things necessary
and meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap. There I’ll sup 217 .
Farewell.</p>
<p>POINS Farewell, my lord.</p>
<p>Exit Poins</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I know you all, and will awhile uphold 218</p>
<p>The unyoked humour 219 of your idleness.</p>
<p>Yet herein will I imitate the sun 220 ,</p>
<p>Who doth permit the base contagious 221 clouds</p>
<p>To smother up his beauty from the world,</p>
<p>That when he please again to be himself,</p>
<p>Being wanted 222 , he may be more wondered at,</p>
<p>By breaking through the foul and ugly mists</p>
<p>Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.</p>
<p>If all the year were playing holidays,</p>
<p>To sport 223 would be as tedious as to work;</p>
<p>But when they seldom come, they wished-for come,</p>
<p>And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents 224 .</p>
<p>So, when this loose behaviour I throw off</p>
<p>And pay the debt I never promisèd,</p>
<p>By how much better than my word I am,</p>
<p>By so much shall I falsify men’s 225 hopes,</p>
<p>And like bright metal on a sullen ground 226 ,</p>
<p>My reformation, glittering o’er my fault,</p>
<p>Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes</p>
<p>Than that which hath no foil 227 to set it off.</p>
<p>I’ll so offend 228 to make offence a skill 229 ,</p>
<p>Redeeming time 230 when men think least I will.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
