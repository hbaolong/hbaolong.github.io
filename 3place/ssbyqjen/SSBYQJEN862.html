<h4 id="scene-3-233-running-scene-2">Scene 3 233 / running scene 2</h4>
<p>Enter [Elizabeth ] the Queen Mother, Lord Rivers and Lord Grey</p>
<p>RIVERS Have patience, madam. There’s no doubt his majesty</p>
<p>Will soon recover his accustomed health.</p>
<p>GREY In that you brook it ill 234 , it makes him worse:</p>
<p>To Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p>Therefore, for God’s sake, entertain good comfort 235 ,</p>
<p>And cheer his grace with quick and merry eyes.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH If he were dead, what would betide on 236 me?</p>
<p>GREY No other harm but loss of such a lord.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH The loss of such a lord includes 237 all harms.</p>
<p>GREY The heavens have blessed you with a goodly 238 son</p>
<p>To be your comforter when he is gone.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah, he is young, and his minority</p>
<p>Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,</p>
<p>A man that loves not me, nor none of you.</p>
<p>RIVERS Is it concluded 239 he shall be Protector 240 ?</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH It is determined, not concluded yet:</p>
<p>But so it must be, if the king miscarry 241 .</p>
<p>Enter Buckingham and [Stanley, Earl of ] Derby</p>
<p>GREY Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Good time of day unto your royal grace.</p>
<p>DERBY God make your majesty joyful as you have been.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH The Countess Richmond 242 , good my 243 lord of
Derby,</p>
<p>To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.</p>
<p>Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she’s your wife,</p>
<p>And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured</p>
<p>I hate not you for her proud arrogance.</p>
<p>DERBY I do beseech you either not believe</p>
<p>The envious 244 slanders of her false accusers,</p>
<p>Or, if she be accused on true report,</p>
<p>Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds</p>
<p>From wayward 245 sickness and no grounded malice.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Saw you the king today, my lord of Derby?</p>
<p>DERBY But now the Duke of Buckingham and I</p>
<p>Are come from visiting his majesty.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH What likelihood of his amendment, lords?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Madam, good hope: his grace speaks cheerfully.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH God grant him health. Did you confer with him?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Ay, madam. He desires to make atonement 246</p>
<p>Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers 247 ,</p>
<p>And between them and my Lord Chamberlain,</p>
<p>And sent to warn 248 them to his royal presence.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Would all were well! But that will never be.</p>
<p>I fear our happiness 249 is at the height.</p>
<p>Enter Richard [with Hastings and Dorset ]</p>
<p>RICHARD They do me wrong, and I will not endure it.</p>
<p>Who is it that complains unto the king</p>
<p>That I, forsooth 250 , am stern 251 and love them not?</p>
<p>By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly 252</p>
<p>That fill his ears with such dissentious 253 rumours.</p>
<p>Because I cannot flatter and look fair 254 ,</p>
<p>Smile in men’s faces, smooth 255 , deceive and cog 256 ,</p>
<p>Duck with French nods 257 and apish 258 courtesy,</p>
<p>I must be held a rancorous enemy.</p>
<p>Cannot a plain 259 man live and think no harm,</p>
<p>But thus his simple truth must be abused</p>
<p>By silken 260 , sly, insinuating jacks 261 ?</p>
<p>GREY To who in all this presence 262 speaks your grace?</p>
<p>RICHARD To thee, that hast nor 263 honesty nor grace 264 .</p>
<p>When have I injured thee? When done thee wrong?</p>
<p>Or thee? Or thee? Or any of your faction?</p>
<p>A plague upon you all! His royal grace —</p>
<p>Whom God preserve better than you would wish —</p>
<p>Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while 265 ,</p>
<p>But you must trouble him with lewd 266 complaints.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.</p>
<p>The king, on his own royal disposition,</p>
<p>And not provoked by any suitor else,</p>
<p>Aiming, belike 267 , at your interior hatred,</p>
<p>That in your outward action shows itself</p>
<p>Against my children, brothers, and myself,</p>
<p>Makes him to send 268 , that he may learn the ground.</p>
<p>RICHARD I cannot tell. The world is grown so bad</p>
<p>That wrens 269 make prey where eagles dare not perch.</p>
<p>Since every Jack became a gentleman,</p>
<p>There’s many a gentle person made a jack.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
Gloucester:</p>
<p>You envy my advancement and my friends 270 ’.</p>
<p>God grant we never may have need of you.</p>
<p>RICHARD Meantime, God grants that I have need of you.</p>
<p>Our brother 271 is imprisoned by your means,</p>
<p>Myself disgraced, and the nobility</p>
<p>Held in contempt, while great promotions</p>
<p>Are daily given to ennoble those</p>
<p>That scarce some two days since were worth a noble 272 .</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH By him that raised me to this careful 273 height</p>
<p>From that contented hap 274 which I enjoyed,</p>
<p>I never did incense his majesty</p>
<p>Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been</p>
<p>An earnest advocate to plead for him.</p>
<p>My lord, you do me shameful injury,</p>
<p>Falsely to draw me 275 in these vile suspects 276 .</p>
<p>RICHARD You may deny that you were not the mean</p>
<p>Of my lord Hastings’ late 277 imprisonment.</p>
<p>RIVERS She may, my lord, for—</p>
<p>RICHARD She may, Lord Rivers? Why, who knows not so?</p>
<p>She may do more, sir, than denying that.</p>
<p>She may help you to many fair preferments 278 ,</p>
<p>And then deny her aiding hand therein,</p>
<p>And lay those honours on your high desert 279 .</p>
<p>What may she not? She may, ay, marry 280 , may she—</p>
<p>RIVERS What, marry, may she?</p>
<p>RICHARD What, marry, may she? Marry with a king,</p>
<p>A bachelor and a handsome stripling 281 too.</p>
<p>Iwis 282 your grandam 283 had a worser match.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH My lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne</p>
<p>Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.</p>
<p>By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty</p>
<p>Of those gross 284 taunts that oft I have endured.</p>
<p>I had rather be a country servant-maid</p>
<p>Than a great queen, with this condition,</p>
<p>To be so bated, scorned and stormèd at.</p>
<p>Enter old Queen Margaret 285 [unseen by the others ]</p>
<p>Small joy have I in being England’s queen.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET And lessened be that small, God, I beseech him!</p>
<p>Speaks aside throughout</p>
<p>Thy honour, state 286 and seat 287 is due to me.</p>
<p>RICHARD What? Threat 288 you me with telling of the king?</p>
<p>To Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p>I will avouch’t 289 in presence of the king.</p>
<p>I dare adventure 290 to be sent to th’Tower.</p>
<p>’Tis time to speak, my pains 291 are quite forgot.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Out 292 , devil! I do remember them too well:</p>
<p>Thou kill’dst my husband Henry in the Tower,</p>
<p>And Edward, my poor son, at Tewkesbury.</p>
<p>RICHARD Ere 293 you were queen, ay, or your husband king,</p>
<p>To Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p>I was a packhorse 294 in his great affairs,</p>
<p>A weeder-out of his proud 295 adversaries,</p>
<p>A liberal rewarder of his friends.</p>
<p>To royalize his blood, I spent mine own.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Ay, and much better blood than his or thine.</p>
<p>RICHARD In all which time you and your husband Grey</p>
<p>Were factious for 296 the House of Lancaster.—</p>
<p>And, Rivers, so were you.— Was not your husband</p>
<p>In Margaret’s battle 297 at St Albans slain 298 ?</p>
<p>Let me put in your minds, if you forget,</p>
<p>What you have been ere this 299 , and what you are:</p>
<p>Withal 300 , what I have been, and what I am.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET A murd’rous villain, and so still thou art.</p>
<p>RICHARD Poor Clarence did forsake his father 301 , Warwick 302 ,</p>
<p>Ay, and forswore himself 303 — which Jesu pardon! —</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Which God revenge!</p>
<p>RICHARD To fight on Edward’s party for the crown.</p>
<p>And for his meed 304 , poor lord, he is mewed up.</p>
<p>I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward’s,</p>
<p>Or Edward’s soft and pitiful 305 , like mine.</p>
<p>I am too childish-foolish 306 for this world.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Hie 307 thee to hell for shame, and leave this
world,</p>
<p>Thou cacodemon 308 ! There thy kingdom is.</p>
<p>RIVERS My lord of Gloucester, in those busy days</p>
<p>Which here you urge 309 to prove us enemies,</p>
<p>We followed then our lord, our sovereign king.</p>
<p>So should we you, if you should be our king.</p>
<p>RICHARD If I should be? I had rather be a pedlar.</p>
<p>Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH As little joy, my lord, as you suppose</p>
<p>You should enjoy were you this country’s king,</p>
<p>As little joy you may suppose in me,</p>
<p>That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET A little joy enjoys the queen thereof,</p>
<p>For I am she, and altogether joyless.</p>
<p>I can no longer hold me patient.—</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out</p>
<p>In sharing that which you have pilled 310 from me.</p>
<p>Which of you trembles not that looks on me?</p>
<p>If not, that I am queen, you bow like subjects,</p>
<p>Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels 311 .</p>
<p>Ah, gentle 312 villain 313 , do not turn away.</p>
<p>To Richard</p>
<p>RICHARD Foul wrinkled witch, what mak’st thou 314 in my sight?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET But repetition of 315 what thou hast marred 316 ,</p>
<p>That will I make 317 before I let thee go.</p>
<p>RICHARD Wert thou not banishèd on pain of death?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET I was, but I do find more pain in banishment</p>
<p>Than death can yield me here by my abode 318 .</p>
<p>A husband and a son thou ow’st to me,</p>
<p>And thou 319 a kingdom; all of you allegiance.</p>
<p>The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,</p>
<p>And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.</p>
<p>RICHARD The curse my noble father laid on thee,</p>
<p>When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper 320</p>
<p>And with thy scorns drew’st rivers from his eyes,</p>
<p>And then, to dry them, gav’st the duke a clout 321</p>
<p>Steeped in the faultless blood of pretty 322 Rutland 323 —</p>
<p>His curses then, from bitterness of soul</p>
<p>Denounced against thee, are all fall’n upon thee,</p>
<p>And God, not we, hath plagued 324 thy bloody deed.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH So just is God, to right the innocent.</p>
<p>HASTINGS O, ’twas the foulest deed to slay that babe 325 ,</p>
<p>And the most merciless that e’er was heard of!</p>
<p>RIVERS Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.</p>
<p>DORSET No man but prophesied 326 revenge for it.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET What? Were you snarling all before I came,</p>
<p>Ready to catch 327 each other by the throat,</p>
<p>And turn you all your hatred now on me?</p>
<p>Did York’s dread curse prevail so much with heaven?</p>
<p>That Henry’s death, my lovely Edward’s death,</p>
<p>Their kingdom’s loss, my woeful banishment,</p>
<p>Should all but answer for 328 that peevish 329 brat?</p>
<p>Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?</p>
<p>Why then give way, dull 330 clouds, to my quick 331 curses.</p>
<p>Though not by war, by surfeit 332 die your king,</p>
<p>As ours by murder, to make him a king.—</p>
<p>Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,</p>
<p>To Elizabeth</p>
<p>For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,</p>
<p>Die in his youth by like 333 untimely violence!</p>
<p>Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,</p>
<p>Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!</p>
<p>Long mayst thou live to wail thy children’s death,</p>
<p>And see another, as I see thee now,</p>
<p>Decked 334 in thy rights, as thou art stalled 335 in mine.</p>
<p>Long die thy happy days before thy death,</p>
<p>And, after many lengthened hours of grief,</p>
<p>Die neither mother, wife, nor England’s queen.—</p>
<p>Rivers and Dorset, you were standers-by 336 ,</p>
<p>And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son</p>
<p>Was stabbed with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,</p>
<p>That none of you may live his natural age,</p>
<p>But by some unlooked 337 accident cut off.</p>
<p>RICHARD Have done thy charm 338 , thou hateful withered hag 339 .</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET And leave out thee? Stay, dog, for thou shalt hear
me.</p>
<p>If heaven have any grievous plague in store</p>
<p>Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,</p>
<p>O, let them 340 keep it till thy sins be ripe,</p>
<p>And then hurl down their indignation</p>
<p>On thee, the troubler of the poor world’s peace.</p>
<p>The worm of conscience still 341 begnaw 342 thy soul.</p>
<p>Thy friends suspect for 343 traitors while thou liv’st,</p>
<p>And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends.</p>
<p>No sleep close up that deadly 344 eye of thine,</p>
<p>Unless it be while some tormenting dream</p>
<p>Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils.</p>
<p>Thou elvish-marked 345 , abortive 346 , rooting hog 347 ,</p>
<p>Thou that wast sealed in thy nativity 348</p>
<p>The slave of nature 349 and the son of hell.</p>
<p>Thou slander 350 of thy heavy 351 mother’s womb,</p>
<p>Thou loathèd issue 352 of thy father’s loins,</p>
<p>Thou rag 353 of honour, thou detested—</p>
<p>RICHARD Margaret 354 .</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Richard.</p>
<p>RICHARD Ha?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET I call thee not.</p>
<p>RICHARD I cry thee mercy 355 looked for 356 then, for I did think</p>
<p>That thou hadst called me all these bitter names.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Why, so I did, but looked for no reply.</p>
<p>O, let me make the period 357 to my curse.</p>
<p>RICHARD ‘Tis done by me, and ends in ’Margaret’.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Thus have you breathed your curse against
yourself.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Poor painted 358 queen, vain flourish 359 of my
fortune 360 .</p>
<p>Why strew’st thou sugar on that bottled 361 spider,</p>
<p>Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?</p>
<p>Fool, fool, thou whet’st 362 a knife to kill thyself.</p>
<p>The day will come that thou shalt wish for me</p>
<p>To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-backed 363 toad.</p>
<p>HASTINGS False-boding 364 woman, end thy frantic 365 curse,</p>
<p>Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Foul shame upon you! You have all moved mine.</p>
<p>RIVERS Were you well served 366 , you would be taught your duty.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET To serve me well, you all should do me duty 367 ,</p>
<p>Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects.</p>
<p>O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty.</p>
<p>DORSET Dispute not with her, she is lunatic.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Peace, Master Marquis 368 , you are malapert 369 :</p>
<p>Your fire-new 370 stamp of honour is scarce current 371 .</p>
<p>O, that your young nobility 372 could judge</p>
<p>What ’twere to lose it, and be miserable.</p>
<p>They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,</p>
<p>And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.</p>
<p>RICHARD Good counsel, marry. Learn it, learn it, marquis.</p>
<p>DORSET It touches you, my lord, as much as me.</p>
<p>RICHARD Ay, and much more. But I was born so high 373 ,</p>
<p>Our eyrie 374 buildeth in the cedar’s top,</p>
<p>And dallies with 375 the wind and scorns the sun 376 .</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET And turns the sun 377 to shade. Alas, alas!</p>
<p>Witness my son, now in the shade of death,</p>
<p>Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath</p>
<p>Hath in eternal darkness folded up.</p>
<p>Your eyrie buildeth in our eyrie’s nest.</p>
<p>O God, that see’st it, do not suffer 378 it.</p>
<p>As it is won with blood, lost be it so!</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Urge neither charity nor shame to me:</p>
<p>Uncharitably with me have you dealt,</p>
<p>And shamefully my hopes by you are butchered.</p>
<p>My charity 379 is outrage 380 , life my shame 381 ,</p>
<p>And in that shame still 382 live my sorrow’s rage.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Have done, have done.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET O princely Buckingham, I’ll kiss thy hand</p>
<p>In sign of league and amity with thee.</p>
<p>Now fair 383 befall thee and thy noble house.</p>
<p>Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,</p>
<p>Nor thou within the compass 384 of my curse.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Nor no one here, for curses never pass 385</p>
<p>The lips of those that breathe them in the air.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET I will not think but 386 they ascend the sky,</p>
<p>And there awake God’s gentle-sleeping peace.</p>
<p>O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog:</p>
<p>Look when 387 he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,</p>
<p>His venom 388 tooth will rankle 389 to the death.</p>
<p>Have not to do with him, beware of him.</p>
<p>Sin, death and hell have set their marks 390 on him,</p>
<p>And all their ministers attend on him.</p>
<p>RICHARD What doth she say, my lord of Buckingham?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Nothing that I respect 391 , my gracious lord.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?</p>
<p>And soothe 392 the devil that I warn thee from?</p>
<p>O, but remember this another day,</p>
<p>When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,</p>
<p>And say poor Margaret was a prophetess.—</p>
<p>Live each of you the subjects to his hate,</p>
<p>And he to yours, and all of you to God’s.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.</p>
<p>RIVERS And so doth mine. I muse why she’s at liberty.</p>
<p>RICHARD I cannot blame her. By God’s holy mother,</p>
<p>She hath had too much wrong, and I repent</p>
<p>My part thereof that I have done to her.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH I never did her any, to my knowledge.</p>
<p>RICHARD Yet you have all the vantage 393 of her wrong 394 .</p>
<p>I was too hot 395 to do somebody good 396 ,</p>
<p>That is too cold 397 in thinking of it now.</p>
<p>Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid:</p>
<p>He is franked up to fatting 398 for his pains —</p>
<p>God pardon them that are the cause thereof!</p>
<p>RIVERS A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,</p>
<p>To pray for them that have done scathe 399 to us.</p>
<p>RICHARD So do I ever, being well 400 advised.—</p>
<p>For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.</p>
<p>Speaks to himself</p>
<p>Enter Catesby</p>
<p>CATESBY Madam, his majesty doth call for you,</p>
<p>And for your grace, and yours, my gracious lord.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Catesby, I come. Lords, will you go with me?</p>
<p>RIVERS We wait upon 401 your grace.</p>
<p>Exeunt all but [Richard of ] Gloucester</p>
<p>RICHARD I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.</p>
<p>The secret mischiefs 402 that I set abroach 403</p>
<p>I lay unto the grievous charge of 404 others.</p>
<p>Clarence, who I indeed have cast in darkness 405 ,</p>
<p>I do beweep 406 to many simple gulls 407 —</p>
<p>Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham —</p>
<p>And tell them ’tis the queen and her allies 408</p>
<p>That stir 409 the king against the duke my brother.</p>
<p>Now they believe it, and withal whet 410 me</p>
<p>To be revenged on Rivers, Dorset, Grey.</p>
<p>But then I sigh, and with a piece of scripture,</p>
<p>Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:</p>
<p>And thus I clothe my naked villainy</p>
<p>With odd old ends 411 stol’n forth of holy writ,</p>
<p>And seem a saint when most I play the devil.</p>
<p>Enter two Murderers</p>
<p>But, soft, here come my executioners.—</p>
<p>How now, my hardy 412 , stout-resolvèd mates,</p>
<p>Are you now going to dispatch 413 this thing?</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER We are, my lord, and come to have the warrant</p>
<p>That we may be admitted where he is.</p>
<p>RICHARD Well thought upon. I have it here about me.</p>
<p>Gives the warrant</p>
<p>When you have done, repair 414 to Crosby Place.</p>
<p>But, sirs, be sudden 415 in the execution,</p>
<p>Withal obdurate 416 , do not hear him plead;</p>
<p>For Clarence is well-spoken 417 , and perhaps</p>
<p>May move your hearts to pity if you mark 418 him.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Tut, tut! My lord, we will not stand to prate 419
:</p>
<p>Talkers are no good doers. Be assured</p>
<p>We go to use our hands and not our tongues.</p>
<p>RICHARD Your eyes drop millstones 420 when fools’ eyes fall 421
tears.</p>
<p>I like you, lads. About your business straight 422 .</p>
<p>Go, go, dispatch.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER We will, my noble lord.</p>
<p>[Exeunt ]</p>
