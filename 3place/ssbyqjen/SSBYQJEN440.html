<h4 id="introduction-to-the-tragedy-of-julius-caesar">Introduction to
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar</h4>
<p>Sir Francis Walsingham, Queen Elizabeth’s Secretary of State,
recommended the study of history with an eye to its contemporary
applications: ‘in the reading of histories as you have principally to
mark how matters have passed in government in those days, so have you to
apply them to these our times and states and see how they may be made
serviceable to our age’. It was in this spirit that Sir Thomas North
produced his translation of Plutarch’s Lives of the Most Noble Grecians
and Romanes , the main source for Shakespeare’s dramatizations of the
events leading to the deaths of Julius Caesar, Brutus and Cassius,
Marcus Antonius and his beloved Cleopatra, and Caius Martius Coriolanus.
Julius Caesar , performed at the Globe theatre in 1599, was the first of
the three plays in which Shakespeare followed Plutarch closely in
exploring key moments of transition in the history of Rome.</p>
<p>Unlike Plutarch, though, Shakespeare begins with the people rather
than the politicians. The common tradesmen are taking a day’s unofficial
holiday in celebration of the return of the conquering Caesar. But the
victory in question is not an imperial one: Julius Caesar has defeated
another Roman general, Pompey the Great, in a civil war. The play will
end with renewed civil war. Elizabethan political culture was much
exercised by the dangers of, on the one hand, the civil strife
concomitant upon uncertainty over the transmission of power and, on the
other hand, the potential for tyranny if too much power were invested in
an individual. In the opening scene the Tribunes – official spokesmen
for the popular will – are worried that the military supremo is proving
too popular. They demand the removal of the tokens honouring Caesar that
have been draped over the statues in the Capitol. We learn a little
later that for their pains in doing so they have been ‘put to silence’.
This kind of detail lends support to Orson Welles’ influential 1930s
production of the play with its jackbooted Caesar and its handling of
Antony’s funeral oration as something out of a Nuremberg Rally.</p>
<p>We should, however, be cautious in fully endorsing such a reading.
The conspirators are not disinterested idealists. Brutus, the most
thoughtful of them, does not initially focus his fears on Caesar’s
ambitions; such a prospect is conjured into him by Cassius’ cunning
rhetoric. ‘The quarrel’, remarks Brutus in soliloquy, ‘will bear no
colour for the thing he is.’ He only persuades himself to join the
conspirators by ‘fashioning’ the argument that the act of crowning
Caesar might itself be the egg that, when hatched, would unleash tyranny
upon the state. The historical irony for Rome, and the personal tragedy
for Brutus, is that the conspiracy itself proves to be the thing that
divides the city and lets slip the dogs of a civil war that only ceases
at the end of Antony and Cleopatra , when Octavius becomes Augustus and
ushers in the imperial phase of Rome’s history.</p>
<p>For over a thousand years, Rome was the city of the world. The Romans
ruled the greatest empire that had ever been seen. Even after its
decline and fall, the name of Rome lived on for centuries by providing
the western world with models of excellence in every dimension of human
life from military technology to political sophistication to theory of
moral character to cultural glories such as architecture and epic
poetry.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s England was a small, vulnerable, upstart nation near
the north-western edge of the known world. When Queen Elizabeth came to
the throne, the country was in a state of near psychotic self-division
as a result of her father’s break from that latter-day Roman empire, the
universal Catholic Church. But in the course of her reign, aristocrats,
intellectuals, seamen, poets and theatre people forged an amazingly bold
new vision: that one day, their tiny island-nation might become a second
Rome. They laid out the building blocks for the future. Naval power
overcame the might of Spain and planted the name of the Virgin Queen on
distant shores. Politicians honed a system of checks and balances
between the two houses of parliament and the monarchy – a system based
on the Roman model of senators, tribunes and emperor, but with a more
flexible legal system, based on common law ‘precedent’ rather than a
fixed code of rules. Educators opened grammar schools for the middle
classes, steeping the future administrators of nation and empire in both
the Latin language and the Roman character of firm backbone and stiff
upper lip (known technically as Stoicism). And Shakespeare’s actors
staged epic dramas in which they told the heroic history both of their
own nation and of the Romans who were their ideal. So it was that when
Britannia came to rule the waves in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar was central to the education and
character-formation of aristocrat, politician and imperial civil servant
alike. Mark Antony’s great speech that sways the popular will –
‘Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears’ – was learned by rote
in school and analysed as the exemplary piece of persuasive oratory (not
least because of its witty trope of denying its own force – ‘I am no
orator’).</p>
<p>The year 1599, when the play was written and performed, was a time of
intense political debate. The second Spanish Armada had been broken up
by bad weather two years before, so superpower rivalry was no longer the
most pressing issue of the day. The problem now was how to deal with a
country that was apparently harbouring rebels and terrorists who were a
threat to the new world order. That country was Ireland. Was the answer
negotiation or brute force?</p>
<p>The argument that prevailed might be described as the
neo-conservative position. It went something like this. England stood on
the threshold of greatness. Having stood up to Spain, it had the
potential to become the greatest empire in the modern world. And so to
the classic conservative move: look to the past in order to understand
the present. The greatest empire in history was that of the ancient
Romans. But Rome hadn’t been built in a day. It had only achieved its
power by building a mighty army and developing military technology of
unprecedented sophistication. Above all, it needed a military genius, an
all-conquering general who could hold whole continents in the palm of
his hand. His name, of course, was Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>The leading exponent of this position was the Earl of Essex. He
sponsored the authorship of historical works and translations of
classical texts that supported his ideals of Roman virtue and fortitude.
He offered himself to Queen Elizabeth as a modern Julius Caesar. In
March 1599 he set off for Ireland at the head of a mighty army. In the
autumn he skulked back to the queen’s court in London, having
ignominiously failed to defeat the Irish rebels. Superior firepower
could not cope with the guerrilla tactics of the insurgents.
Shakespeare’s play was written in the fearful interim between the first
motion against the insurrection and the realization of the hideous dream
of failure.</p>
<p>Essex’s image of himself as Julius Caesar went to his head. His
Rubicon moment came eighteen months later, when ‘assisted by sundry
Noblemen and Gentlemen’ (Shakespeare’s patron, the Earl of Southampton,
among them), he marched against the queen herself, vainly imagining that
the people of London would flood into the streets and offer him the
crown. He was executed for his pains.</p>
<p>Shakespeare had a very different take on his material from that of
Essex. He was fascinated by the assassination of Julius Caesar and its
aftermath because this was the period in Roman history that asked the
most fundamental questions about politics: does authority belong to the
people, to an individual ruler, or to an abstraction called ‘the state’?
What is the most effective form of government – a monarchy, an empire,
an oligarchy, a republic?</p>
<p>At the beginning of the play, the long-established Roman republic,
with its system of checks and balances (senators representing the
patricians and tribunes the plebeians), is in crisis. If Caesar is not
stopped, democracy will be destroyed. But are the men who try to stop
him acting out of duty to the state or personal ambition? And what
happens once the knife has gone in? Chaos, civil war, and then the
events of the play’s sequel, Antony and Cleopatra , in which there is a
failed attempt to divide rule between three men and then the rise to
power of a new Caesar, Octavius, who would later be called Augustus, the
inaugurator of the imperium.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that he was writing under Elizabeth, a queen-emperor
who saw herself as another Augustus, and despite the apparent approval
of Essex’s Irish expedition that he worked into the prologue of Henry V
at exactly the time he was writing Julius Caesar , Shakespeare seems to
have been genuinely sceptical about the imperial project associated with
the name of Caesar. At the same time, he was horrified by the idea of
mob rule, as witness the scene when Cinna the poet is lynched because he
happens to share a name with one of the conspirators.</p>
<p>The character who invites particular sympathy is Brutus, guardian of
republican values, as he wrestles with the question of whether to be or
not to be a conspirator. Cassius espouses the philosophy of Epicurus,
who believed that the gods do not intervene in human affairs: what will
be will be, and so there is no need to pay attention to omens and
auguries. From this philosophy it is only a short step to that of
Machiavelli – might is right and there is no such thing as a moral
order. Brutus, by contrast, is portrayed as a Stoic, a philosophy
associated with the idea of duty and the cultivation of mental fortitude
as a shield against the vicissitudes of fortune. The austere moralist
Cato had killed himself rather than submit to Caesar’s rule, whereas
Brutus follows those Stoics who said that however bad life became it had
to be endured by putting on the armour of ‘patience’. But in the last
resort neither Cassius nor Brutus can maintain their position: Cassius
has to accept the power of prophecy and Brutus commits suicide in the
manner of Cato. Shakespeare is always interested in how words are
confounded by deeds, how philosophical positions collapse under the
pressure of action and circumstance.</p>
<p>Shakespeare must have had the heavy folio of North’s English
translation of Plutarch open on his desk as he wrote. Read the ‘Life of
Marcus Brutus’ therein and you see the raw materials on which the
dramatist’s imagination set to work. The glory of the theatre is that it
can bring the interior character to life. In Act 1, we see the public
face of an apparently untroubled Brutus, but at the beginning of Act 2
Shakespeare conjures up the atmosphere of night, takes Brutus from his
bed and places him alone on the bare boards of the Globe. The art of
soliloquy then allows us to enter into that troubled mind, to weigh the
greatness of the danger, to share the deep thoughts of the
enterprise:</p>
<p>It must be by his death: and for my part,</p>
<p>I know no personal cause to spurn at him</p>
<p>But for the general. He would be crowned:</p>
<p>How that might change his nature, there’s the question.</p>
<p>There’s the question. Anton Chekhov, perhaps the greatest dramatist
since Shakespeare, said that the business of the dramatist is not to
provide solutions but to pose problems in the correct way. Julius Caesar
doesn’t give us easy answers about the relationship of public duty to
private will. Shakespeare was content to dramatize the problem and leave
the rest to his audience.</p>
<p>A clock strikes, men wear doublets rather than togas, night-watchmen
patrol and there are references to handkerchiefs: such purposeful
anachronisms reveal that Shakespeare was a ‘modern-dress’ dramatist,
making the past speak to the present. To what degree should political
power be concentrated in a single leader? Is the democratic process
strong enough to withstand a potential tyrant or are there times when
direct action on the street is the only possible course of action? Can
we trust politicians to serve the people rather than their own
interests? In addressing such questions, the play remains alive and full
of troubling force in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Julius Caesar has returned to Rome triumphant from the war
against Pompey. The Roman republic is prepared to heap him with new
honours, causing concern and dismay among some senators who fear that
too much power is held by one man. Caius Cassius plots a conspiracy to
murder Caesar, enlisting the support of the well-respected Marcus
Brutus. Brutus has misgivings but is persuaded that Caesar’s death is
necessary for the good of the republic. However, he rejects Cassius’
proposal that Mark Antony, close friend of Caesar, should also be
killed. Brutus, Cassius and their co-conspirators stab Caesar to death
at the senate house on the Ides of March. At Caesar’s funeral Brutus
addresses the people and successfully explains the conspirators’
motives. However, Mark Antony speaks next and turns the mob against the
conspirators, who are forced to flee from Rome. Mark Antony and Caesar’s
nephew, Octavius, take command of Rome and lead an army against the
conspirators. Brutus and Cassius are defeated at Philippi where they
kill themselves rather than be captured.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage) Marcus Brutus (28%/194/12), Caius Cassius (20%/140/8), Mark
Antony (13%/51/8), Julius Caesar (5%/42/4), Casca (5%/39/4), Portia
(4%/16/2), Octavius Caesar (2%/19/3), Decius Brutus (2%/12/3).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 95% verse, 5% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: 1599. Not mentioned by Meres in 1598, seen at the Globe by
Swiss visitor Thomas Platter in September 1599. Alluded to in several
plays and poems by other writers in the period 1599–1601.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Based on the biographies of Julius Caesar and Marcus Brutus,
with brief reference to the life of Cicero, in Sir Thomas North’s
English translation of Plutarch’s Lives of the Most Noble Grecians and
Romanes (1579).</p>
<p>TEXT: 1623 Folio is the only early printed text. Exceptionally good
quality of printing, perhaps set from the theatre promptbook or a
transcription of it. Some editors have detected signs of revision in the
fact that Brutus is told twice of Portia’s suicide, and proposed that
one or other account should be deleted, but in the theatre this double
testing of his Stoic response is highly effective.</p>
