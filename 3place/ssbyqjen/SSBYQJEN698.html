<h4 id="scene-1-940-running-scene-8">Scene 1 940 / running scene 8</h4>
<p>Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Lord Mortimer and Owen Glendower</p>
<p>MORTIMER These promises 941 are fair, the parties sure 942 ,</p>
<p>And our induction 943 full of prosperous hope 944 .</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,</p>
<p>Will you sit down?</p>
<p>And uncle Worcester — a plague upon it,</p>
<p>I have forgot the map!</p>
<p>GLENDOWER No, here it is.</p>
<p>Shows a map</p>
<p>Sit, cousin Percy, sit, good cousin Hotspur —</p>
<p>For by that name as oft as Lancaster 945</p>
<p>Doth speak of you, his cheeks look pale and with</p>
<p>A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke
of.</p>
<p>GLENDOWER I cannot blame him: at my nativity</p>
<p>The front 946 of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</p>
<p>Of burning cressets 947 , and at my birth</p>
<p>The frame and foundation of the earth</p>
<p>Shaked like a coward.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Why, so it would have done at the same season, if your
mother’s cat had but kittened, though yourself had never been born.</p>
<p>GLENDOWER I say the earth did shake when I was born.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR And I say the earth was not of my mind,</p>
<p>If you suppose as fearing you 948 it shook.</p>
<p>GLENDOWER The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,</p>
<p>And not in fear of your nativity.</p>
<p>Diseasèd nature oftentimes breaks forth</p>
<p>In strange eruptions 949 ; and the teeming 950 earth</p>
<p>Is with a kind of colic 951 pinched and vexed</p>
<p>By the imprisoning of unruly wind</p>
<p>Within her womb 952 , which, for enlargement 953 striving,</p>
<p>Shakes the old beldam 954 earth and tumbles down</p>
<p>Steeples and moss-grown 955 towers. At your birth</p>
<p>Our grandam 956 earth, having this distemperature 957 ,</p>
<p>In passion 958 shook.</p>
<p>GLENDOWER Cousin, of many men</p>
<p>I do not bear these crossings 959 . Give me leave</p>
<p>To tell you once again that at my birth</p>
<p>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</p>
<p>The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds</p>
<p>Were strangely clamorous 960 to the frighted fields 961 .</p>
<p>These signs have marked me 962 extraordinary,</p>
<p>And all the courses 963 of my life do show</p>
<p>I am not in the roll 964 of common men.</p>
<p>Where is the living 965 , clipped in with 966 the sea</p>
<p>That chides 967 the banks of England, Scotland and Wales,</p>
<p>Which calls me pupil, or hath read to 968 me?</p>
<p>And bring him out that is but woman’s son</p>
<p>Can trace 969 me in the tedious 970 ways of art 971</p>
<p>And hold me pace 972 in deep experiments 973 .</p>
<p>HOTSPUR I think there’s no man speaks better Welsh 974 .</p>
<p>I’ll to dinner.</p>
<p>MORTIMER Peace, cousin Percy, you will make him mad.</p>
<p>GLENDOWER I can call 975 spirits from the vasty deep 976 .</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Why, so can I, or so can any man.</p>
<p>But will they come when you do call for them?</p>
<p>GLENDOWER Why, I can teach thee, cousin, to command the devil.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR And I can teach thee, cousin, to shame the devil</p>
<p>By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil 977 .</p>
<p>If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,</p>
<p>And I’ll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.</p>
<p>O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!</p>
<p>MORTIMER Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.</p>
<p>GLENDOWER Three times hath Henry Bullingbrook made head 978</p>
<p>Against my power 979 : thrice from the banks of Wye 980</p>
<p>And sandy-bottomed Severn have I sent him</p>
<p>Bootless 981 home and weather-beaten back.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Home without boots, and in foul weather too!</p>
<p>How scapes he agues 982 , in the devil’s name?</p>
<p>GLENDOWER Come, here’s the map: shall we divide our right 983</p>
<p>According to our threefold order ta’en 984 ?</p>
<p>MORTIMER The archdeacon 985 hath divided it</p>
<p>Into three limits 986 very equally:</p>
<p>England, from Trent and Severn hitherto 987 ,</p>
<p>By south and east is to my part assigned:</p>
<p>All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,</p>
<p>And all the fertile land within that bound,</p>
<p>To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you</p>
<p>The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.</p>
<p>And our indentures tripartite 988 are drawn 989 ,</p>
<p>Which being sealèd interchangeably 990 —</p>
<p>A business that this night may execute 991 —</p>
<p>Tomorrow, cousin Percy, you and I</p>
<p>And my good lord of Worcester will set forth</p>
<p>To meet your father and the Scottish power,</p>
<p>As is appointed 992 us, at Shrewsbury 993 .</p>
<p>My father 994 Glendower is not ready yet,</p>
<p>Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days.—</p>
<p>Within that space 995 you may have drawn together</p>
<p>To Glendower</p>
<p>Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.</p>
<p>GLENDOWER A shorter time shall send me to you, lords.</p>
<p>And in my conduct 996 shall your ladies come,</p>
<p>From whom you now must steal 997 and take no leave,</p>
<p>For there will be a world of water 998 shed</p>
<p>Upon the parting of your wives and you.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Methinks my moiety 999 , north from Burton 1000 here,</p>
<p>Looks at map</p>
<p>In quantity equals not one of yours:</p>
<p>See how this river comes me cranking in 1001 ,</p>
<p>And cuts me from the best of all my land</p>
<p>A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out 1002 .</p>
<p>I’ll have the current in this place dammed up,</p>
<p>And here the smug 1003 and silver Trent shall run</p>
<p>In a new channel, fair and evenly.</p>
<p>It shall not wind with such a deep indent 1004 ,</p>
<p>To rob me of so rich a bottom 1005 here.</p>
<p>GLENDOWER Not wind? It shall, it must. You see it doth.</p>
<p>MORTIMER Yea, but</p>
<p>Mark how he 1006 bears his course, and runs me 1007 up</p>
<p>With like advantage 1008 on the other side,</p>
<p>Gelding 1009 the opposèd continent 1010 as much</p>
<p>As on the other side it takes from you.</p>
<p>WORCESTER Yea, but a little charge 1011 will trench 1012 him here</p>
<p>And on this north side win this cape 1013 of land,</p>
<p>And then he runs straight and even.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR I’ll have it so. A little charge will do it.</p>
<p>GLENDOWER I’ll not have it altered.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Will not you?</p>
<p>GLENDOWER No, nor you shall not.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Who shall say me nay?</p>
<p>GLENDOWER Why, that will I.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Let me not understand you, then. Speak it in Welsh 1014 .</p>
<p>GLENDOWER I can speak English, lord, as well as you,</p>
<p>For I was trained up in the English court;</p>
<p>Where, being but young 1015 , I framed to 1016 the harp</p>
<p>Many an English ditty 1017 lovely 1018 well</p>
<p>And gave the tongue a helpful ornament 1019 ;</p>
<p>A virtue 1020 that was never seen in you.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Marry,</p>
<p>And I am glad of it with all my heart.</p>
<p>I had rather be a kitten and cry mew</p>
<p>Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers 1021 .</p>
<p>I had rather hear a brazen 1022 candlestick turned 1023 ,</p>
<p>Or a dry 1024 wheel grate on the axle-tree 1025 ,</p>
<p>And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,</p>
<p>Nothing so much as 1026 mincing 1027 poetry:</p>
<p>’Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag 1028 .</p>
<p>GLENDOWER Come, you shall have Trent turned.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR I do not care: I’ll give thrice so much land</p>
<p>To any well-deserving friend;</p>
<p>But in the way of bargain 1029 , mark ye me,</p>
<p>I’ll cavil on 1030 the ninth part of a hair.</p>
<p>Are the indentures drawn 1031 ? Shall we be gone?</p>
<p>GLENDOWER The moon shines fair, you may away by night.</p>
<p>I’ll haste the writer 1032 and withal 1033</p>
<p>Break with 1034 your wives of your departure hence.</p>
<p>I am afraid my daughter will run mad,</p>
<p>So much she doteth on 1035 her Mortimer.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>MORTIMER Fie, cousin Percy, how you cross 1036 my father!</p>
<p>HOTSPUR I cannot choose 1037 : sometime he angers me</p>
<p>With telling me of the mouldwarp 1038 and the ant,</p>
<p>Of the dreamer 1039 Merlin 1040 and his prophecies,</p>
<p>And of a dragon and a finless fish,</p>
<p>A clip-winged 1041 griffin 1042 and a moulten 1043 raven,</p>
<p>A couching 1044 lion and a ramping 1045 cat,</p>
<p>And such a deal of skimble-skamble 1046 stuff</p>
<p>As puts me from my faith 1047 . I tell you what,</p>
<p>He held me last night at least nine hours</p>
<p>In reck’ning up 1048 the several 1049 devils’ names</p>
<p>That were his lackeys 1050 : I cried ‘Hum’ 1051 , and ‘Well, go to’
1052 ,</p>
<p>But marked him 1053 not a word. O, he is as tedious</p>
<p>As a tired horse, a railing 1054 wife,</p>
<p>Worse than a smoky house. I had rather live</p>
<p>With cheese and garlic in a windmill 1055 far,</p>
<p>Than feed on cates 1056 and have him talk to me</p>
<p>In any summer-house 1057 in Christendom.</p>
<p>MORTIMER In faith 1058 , he was a worthy gentleman,</p>
<p>Exceeding well read, and profited</p>
<p>In strange concealments 1059 , valiant as a lion</p>
<p>And wondrous affable and as bountiful</p>
<p>As mines of India 1060 . Shall I tell you, cousin?</p>
<p>He holds your temper 1061 in a high respect</p>
<p>And curbs himself even of his natural scope 1062</p>
<p>When you do cross his humour 1063 — ’faith, he does.</p>
<p>I warrant you, that man is not alive</p>
<p>Might so have tempted 1064 him as you have done,</p>
<p>Without the taste of danger and reproof 1065 :</p>
<p>But do not use it oft 1066 , let me entreat you.</p>
<p>WORCESTER In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame 1067 ,</p>
<p>To Hotspur</p>
<p>And since your coming hither have done enough</p>
<p>To put him quite beside 1068 s his patience.</p>
<p>You must needs 1069 learn, lord, to amend this fault:</p>
<p>Though sometimes it show 1070 greatness, courage, blood 1071 —</p>
<p>And that’s the dearest grace 1072 it renders 1073 you —</p>
<p>Yet oftentimes it doth present 1074 harsh rage,</p>
<p>Defect of manners, want of government 1075 ,</p>
<p>Pride, haughtiness, opinion 1076 and disdain,</p>
<p>The least of which haunting 1077 a nobleman</p>
<p>Loseth 1078 men’s hearts and leaves behind a stain</p>
<p>Upon the beauty of all parts besides 1079 ,</p>
<p>Beguiling 1080 them of commendation.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Well, I am schooled 1081 . Good manners be your speed 1082
!</p>
<p>Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.</p>
<p>Enter Glendower with the Ladies</p>
<p>MORTIMER This is the deadly spite 1083 that angers me:</p>
<p>My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.</p>
<p>GLENDOWER My daughter weeps. She’ll not part with you,</p>
<p>She’ll be a soldier too, she’ll to the wars.</p>
<p>MORTIMER Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy 1084</p>
<p>Shall follow in your conduct 1085 speedily.</p>
<p>Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same</p>
<p>GLENDOWER She is desperate here 1086 : a peevish self-willed harlotry
1087 ,</p>
<p>One that no persuasion can do good upon.</p>
<p>The Lady speaks in Welsh</p>
<p>MORTIMER I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh 1088</p>
<p>Which thou pour’st down from these swelling heavens 1089</p>
<p>I am too perfect 1090 in, and, but for shame,</p>
<p>In such a parley 1091 should I answer thee.</p>
<p>The Lady [speaks ] again in Welsh</p>
<p>I understand thy kisses and thou mine,</p>
<p>And that’s a feeling disputation 1092 .</p>
<p>But I will never be a truant 1093 , love,</p>
<p>Till I have learned thy language, for thy tongue</p>
<p>Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penned 1094 ,</p>
<p>Sung by a fair queen in a summer’s bower,</p>
<p>With ravishing division 1095 , to her lute.</p>
<p>GLENDOWER Nay, if thou melt 1096 , then will she run mad.</p>
<p>The Lady speaks again in Welsh</p>
<p>MORTIMER O, I am ignorance itself in this 1097 !</p>
<p>GLENDOWER She bids you on the wanton rushes 1098 lay you down</p>
<p>And rest your gentle head upon her lap,</p>
<p>And she will sing the song that pleaseth you</p>
<p>And on your eyelids crown 1099 the god of sleep,</p>
<p>Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness 1100 ,</p>
<p>Making such difference ’twixt wake and sleep</p>
<p>As is the difference betwixt day and night</p>
<p>The hour before the heavenly-harnessed team 1101</p>
<p>Begins his golden progress 1102 in the east.</p>
<p>MORTIMER With all my heart I’ll sit and hear her sing:</p>
<p>By that time will our book 1103 , I think, be drawn 1104 .</p>
<p>GLENDOWER Do so,</p>
<p>And those musicians that shall play to you</p>
<p>Hang in the air 1105 a thousand leagues 1106 from hence,</p>
<p>And straight 1107 they shall be here: sit, and attend.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Come, Kate, thou art perfect in 1108 lying down 1109 : come,
quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.</p>
<p>LADY PERCY Go, ye giddy goose.</p>
<p>The music plays</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh 1110 , and ’tis no
marvel he is so humorous 1111 . By’r lady, he’s a good musician.</p>
<p>LADY PERCY Then would you be nothing but musical, for you are
altogether governed by humours 1112 . Lie still, ye thief, and hear the
lady sing in Welsh.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR I had rather hear Lady, my brach 1113 , howl in Irish 1114
.</p>
<p>LADY PERCY Wouldst have thy head broken 1115 ?</p>
<p>HOTSPUR No.</p>
<p>LADY PERCY Then be still 1116 .</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Neither 1117 , ’tis a woman’s fault 1118 .</p>
<p>LADY PERCY Now God help thee!</p>
<p>HOTSPUR To the Welsh lady’s bed.</p>
<p>LADY PERCY What’s that?</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Peace, she sings.</p>
<p>Here the Lady sings a Welsh song</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Come, I’ll have your song too.</p>
<p>To Lady Percy</p>
<p>LADY PERCY Not mine, in good sooth 1119 .</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Not yours, in good sooth?</p>
<p>You swear like a comfit-maker’s 1120 wife.</p>
<p>‘Not you, in good sooth’, and ‘As true as I live’,</p>
<p>And ‘As God shall mend me’ and ‘As sure as day!’</p>
<p>And givest such sarcenet 1121 surety 1122 for thy oaths,</p>
<p>As if thou never walk’st further than Finsbury 1123 .</p>
<p>Swear me 1124 , Kate, like a lady as thou art,</p>
<p>A good mouth-filling oath, and leave ‘in sooth’,</p>
<p>And such protest of pepper-gingerbread 1125 1126 ,</p>
<p>To velvet-guards 1127 and Sunday-citizens 1128 .</p>
<p>Come, sing.</p>
<p>LADY PERCY I will not sing.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR ’Tis the next way to turn tailor 1129 , or be red-breast
teacher 1130 . An the indentures be drawn, I’ll away within these two
hours, and so, come in when ye will.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>GLENDOWER Come, come, Lord Mortimer, you are as slow</p>
<p>As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.</p>
<p>By this 1131 our book is drawn, we’ll but seal 1132 ,</p>
<p>And then to horse immediately.</p>
<p>MORTIMER With all my heart.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
