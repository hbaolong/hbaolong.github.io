12</h4>
<p>Enter Jailer and his Friend</p>
<p>JAILER Hear you no more? Was nothing said of me</p>
<p>Concerning the escape of Palamon?</p>
<p>Good sir, remember.</p>
<p>FIRST FRIEND Nothing that I heard,</p>
<p>For I came home before the business</p>
<p>Was fully ended: yet I might perceive,</p>
<p>Ere I departed, a great likelihood</p>
<p>Of both their pardons: for Hippolyta</p>
<p>And fair-eyed Emily, upon their knees,</p>
<p>Begged with such handsome 1019 pity that the duke</p>
<p>Methought stood staggering 1020 whether he should follow</p>
<p>His rash oath or the sweet compassion</p>
<p>Of those two ladies: and, to second them,</p>
<p>That truly noble Prince Pirithous,</p>
<p>Half his own heart set in too 1021 , that 1022 I hope</p>
<p>All shall be well. Neither heard I one question</p>
<p>Of your name, or his scape.</p>
<p>Enter Second Friend</p>
<p>JAILER Pray heaven it hold 1023 so.</p>
<p>SECOND FRIEND Be of good comfort man: I bring you news,</p>
<p>Good news.</p>
<p>JAILER They 1024 are welcome.</p>
<p>SECOND FRIEND Palamon has cleared you,</p>
<p>And got your pardon, and discovered 1025 how</p>
<p>And by whose means he escaped, which was your daughter’s,</p>
<p>Whose pardon is procured too: and the prisoner,</p>
<p>Not to be held ungrateful to her goodness,</p>
<p>Has given a sum of money to her marriage,</p>
<p>A large one, I’ll assure you.</p>
<p>JAILER Ye are a good man</p>
<p>And ever 1026 bring good news.</p>
<p>FIRST FRIEND How was it ended?</p>
<p>SECOND FRIEND Why, as it should be: they that ne’er begged</p>
<p>But they prevailed 1027 had their suits fairly 1028 granted:</p>
<p>The prisoners have their lives.</p>
<p>FIRST FRIEND I knew ’twould be so.</p>
<p>SECOND FRIEND But there be new conditions, which you’ll hear of</p>
<p>At better time.</p>
<p>JAILER I hope they are good.</p>
<p>SECOND FRIEND They are honourable:</p>
<p>How good they’ll prove, I know not.</p>
<p>Enter Wooer</p>
<p>FIRST FRIEND ’Twill be known.</p>
<p>WOOER Alas, sir, where’s your daughter?</p>
<p>JAILER Why do you ask?</p>
<p>WOOER O, sir, when did you see her?</p>
<p>SECOND FRIEND How he looks! 1029</p>
<p>JAILER This morning.</p>
<p>WOOER Was she well? Was she in health, sir?</p>
<p>When did she sleep?</p>
<p>FIRST FRIEND These are strange questions.</p>
<p>JAILER I do not think she was very well, for now</p>
<p>You make me mind 1030 her: but this very day</p>
<p>I asked her questions, and she answered me</p>
<p>So far from what she was, so childishly,</p>
<p>So sillily, as if she were a fool,</p>
<p>An innocent 1031 , and I was very angry.</p>
<p>But what of her, sir?</p>
<p>WOOER Nothing but my pity 1032 .</p>
<p>But you must know it, and as good by me</p>
<p>As by 1033 another that less loves her.</p>
<p>JAILER Well, sir?</p>
<p>FIRST FRIEND Not right 1034 ?</p>
<p>SECOND FRIEND Not well?</p>
<p>WOOER No, sir, not well. ’Tis too true, she is mad.</p>
<p>FIRST FRIEND It cannot be!</p>
<p>WOOER Believe, you’ll find it so.</p>
<p>JAILER I half suspected</p>
<p>What you told me: the gods comfort her!</p>
<p>Either this was her love to Palamon,</p>
<p>Or fear of my miscarrying on 1035 his scape,</p>
<p>Or both.</p>
<p>WOOER ’Tis likely.</p>
<p>JAILER But why all this haste, sir?</p>
<p>WOOER I’ll tell you quickly. As I late 1036 was angling 1037</p>
<p>In the great lake that lies behind the palace,</p>
<p>From the far shore, thick set with reeds and sedges,</p>
<p>As patiently I was attending sport 1038 ,</p>
<p>I heard a voice, a shrill one, and attentive</p>
<p>I gave my ear, when I might well perceive</p>
<p>’Twas one that sung, and by the smallness 1039 of it,</p>
<p>A boy or woman. I then left my angle 1040</p>
<p>To his own skill 1041 , came near, but yet perceived not</p>
<p>Who made the sound, the rushes and the reeds</p>
<p>Had so encompassed 1042 it. I laid me down</p>
<p>And listened to the words she sung, for then,</p>
<p>Through a small glade 1043 cut by the fishermen,</p>
<p>I saw it was your daughter.</p>
<p>JAILER Pray go on, sir.</p>
<p>WOOER She sung much, but no sense, only I heard her</p>
<p>Repeat this often: ’Palamon is gone,</p>
<p>Is gone to th’wood to gather mulberries.</p>
<p>I’ll find him out tomorrow.’</p>
<p>FIRST FRIEND Pretty 1044 soul!</p>
<p>WOOER ’His shackles will betray him, he’ll be taken,</p>
<p>And what shall I do then? I’ll bring a bevy 1045 ,</p>
<p>A hundred black-eyed maids that love as I do,</p>
<p>With chaplets 1046 on their heads of daffodillies,</p>
<p>With cherry lips and cheeks of damask 1047 roses,</p>
<p>And all we’ll dance an antic 1048 ’fore the duke</p>
<p>And beg his pardon.’ Then she talked of you, sir:</p>
<p>That you must lose your head tomorrow morning,</p>
<p>And she must gather flowers to bury you,</p>
<p>And see the house made handsome 1049 . Then she sung</p>
<p>Nothing but ‘Willow, willow, willow’ 1050 and between</p>
<p>Ever was ‘Palamon, fair Palamon’,</p>
<p>And ‘Palamon was a tall 1051 young man.’ The place</p>
<p>Was knee-deep where she sat: her careless tresses 1052 ,</p>
<p>A wreath of bullrush rounded 1053 : about her stuck</p>
<p>Thousand fresh water flowers of several colours,</p>
<p>That methought she appeared like the fair nymph 1054</p>
<p>That feeds the lake with waters, or as Iris 1055</p>
<p>Newly dropped down from heaven. Rings she made</p>
<p>Of rushes that grew by and to ’em spoke</p>
<p>The prettiest posies 1056 : ’Thus our true love’s tied:</p>
<p>This you may loose, not me’ and many a one:</p>
<p>And then she wept, and sung again, and sighed,</p>
<p>And with the same breath smiled, and kissed her hand.</p>
<p>SECOND FRIEND Alas, what pity it is!</p>
<p>WOOER I made 1057 in to her.</p>
<p>She saw me, and straight sought the flood 1058 . I saved her,</p>
<p>And set her safe to land, when presently</p>
<p>She slipped away and to the city made,</p>
<p>With such a cry and swiftness that, believe me,</p>
<p>She left me far behind her. Three or four</p>
<p>I saw from far off cross 1059 her: one of ’em</p>
<p>I knew to be your brother, where she stayed 1060</p>
<p>And fell, scarce 1061 to be got away. I left them with her,</p>
<p>Enter Brother, Daughter and others</p>
<p>And hither came to tell you. Here they are.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER May you never more enjoy the light … (etc. 1062
)</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Is not this a fine song?</p>
<p>JAILER’S BROTHER O, a very fine one.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER I can sing twenty more.</p>
<p>JAILER’S BROTHER I think you can.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER Yes, truly, can I: I can sing ‘The Broom’,</p>
<p>And ‘Bonny Robin’ 1063 . Are not you a tailor?</p>
<p>JAILER’S BROTHER Yes.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER Where’s my wedding-gown?</p>
<p>JAILER’S BROTHER I’ll bring it tomorrow.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER Do, very early: I must be abroad else 1064</p>
<p>To call the maids and pay the minstrels,</p>
<p>For I must lose my maidenhead 1065 by cocklight 1066 ,</p>
<p>’Twill never thrive 1067 else.</p>
<p>O fair, O sweet 1068 … (etc. )</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>JAILER’S BROTHER You must ev’n 1069 take it patiently.</p>
<p>JAILER ’Tis true.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER Good ev’n, good men: pray did you ever hear</p>
<p>Of one young Palamon?</p>
<p>JAILER Yes, wench, we know him.</p>
<p>DAUGHTER Is’t not a fine young gentleman?</p>
<p>JAILER ’Tis, love.</p>
<p>JAILER’S BROTHER By no means cross 1070 her, she is then distempered
1071</p>
<p>Far worse than now she shows.</p>
<p>FIRST FRIEND Yes, he’s a fine man.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER O, is he so? You have a sister.</p>
<p>FIRST FRIEND Yes.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER But she shall never have him, tell her so,</p>
<p>For 1072 a trick that I know: you’d best look to her,</p>
<p>For if she see him once, she’s gone, she’s done</p>
<p>And undone 1073 in an hour. All the young maids</p>
<p>Of our town are in love with him, but I laugh at ’em</p>
<p>And let ’em all alone 1074 . Is’t not a wise course?</p>
<p>FIRST FRIEND Yes.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER There is at least two hundred now with child by him
—</p>
<p>There must be four — yet I keep close 1075 for all this,</p>
<p>Close as a cockle 1076 : and all these must be boys —</p>
<p>He has the trick on’t 1077 — and at ten years old</p>
<p>They must be all gelt 1078 for musicians</p>
<p>And sing the wars of Theseus.</p>
<p>SECOND FRIEND This is strange.</p>
<p>JAILER’S BROTHER As ever you heard, but say nothing.</p>
<p>FIRST FRIEND No.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER They come from all parts of the dukedom to him.</p>
<p>I’ll warrant ye, he had not so few last night</p>
<p>As twenty to dispatch, he’ll tickle’t up 1079</p>
<p>In two hours, if his hand be in 1080 .</p>
<p>JAILER She’s lost</p>
<p>Past all cure.</p>
<p>JAILER’S BROTHER Heaven forbid, man.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER Come hither, you are a wise man.</p>
<p>To Jailer</p>
<p>FIRST FRIEND Does she know 1081 him?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>SECOND FRIEND No,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Would she did.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER You are master of a ship?</p>
<p>JAILER Yes.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER Where’s your compass?</p>
<p>JAILER Here.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER Set it to th’north.</p>
<p>And now direct your course to th’wood 1082 , where Palamon</p>
<p>Lies longing for me. For the tackling 1083</p>
<p>Let me alone 1084 .—Come, weigh 1085 , my hearts, cheerily all.</p>
<p>Owgh! 1086 Owgh! Owgh!— ’Tis up, the wind’s fair!—</p>
<p>Top the bowline! 1087 —</p>
<p>Out with the mainsail!— Where’s your whistle, master?</p>
<p>JAILER’S BROTHER Let’s get her in.</p>
<p>JAILER Up to the top 1088 , boy.</p>
<p>JAILER’S BROTHER Where’s the pilot?</p>
<p>FIRST FRIEND Here.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER What kenn’st 1089 thou?</p>
<p>SECOND FRIEND A fair wood 1090 .</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER Bear for it, master: tack about.</p>
<p>When Cynthia 1091 with her</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>borrowed light … (etc. )</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
