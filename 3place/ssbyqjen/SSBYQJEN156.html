<h4 id="scene-1running-scene-4-continues">Scene 1／running scene 4
continues</h4>
<p>Enter the Clowns 448 [Bottom, Quince, Snug, Flute, Snout and
Starveling ]</p>
<p>BOTTOM Are we all met?</p>
<p>QUINCE Pat 449 , pat, and here’s a marvellous convenient place for
our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn brake
450 our tiring-house 451 , and we will do it in action as we will do it
before the duke.</p>
<p>BOTTOM Peter Quince?</p>
<p>QUINCE What sayest thou, bully 452 Bottom?</p>
<p>BOTTOM There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that
will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself;
which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?</p>
<p>SNOUT By’r lakin 453 , a parlous 454 fear.</p>
<p>STARVELING I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done
455 .</p>
<p>BOTTOM Not a whit: I have a device to make all well. Write me 456 a
prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our
swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed. And for the more better
assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the
weaver; this will put them out of fear.</p>
<p>QUINCE Well, we will have such a prologue, and it shall be written in
eight and six 457 .</p>
<p>BOTTOM No, make it two more: let it be written in eight and
eight.</p>
<p>SNOUT Will not the ladies be afeard 458 of the lion?</p>
<p>STARVELING I fear it 459 , I promise you.</p>
<p>BOTTOM Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in —
God shield us! — a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing. For there
is not a more fearful 460 wild-fowl 461 than your lion living. And we
ought to look to it.</p>
<p>SNOUT Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.</p>
<p>BOTTOM Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen
through the lion’s neck, and he himself must speak through, saying thus,
or to the same defect 462 : ‘Ladies’ or ‘Fair-ladies, I would wish you’
or ‘I would request you’ or ‘I would entreat you, not to fear, not to
tremble. My life for yours 463 . If you think I come hither as a lion,
it were pity of my life 464 . No, I am no such thing, I am a man as
other men are.’ And there indeed let him name his name, and tell them
plainly 465 he is Snug the joiner.</p>
<p>QUINCE Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things: that is,
to bring the moonlight into a chamber, for you know Pyramus and Thisbe
meet by moonlight.</p>
<p>SNOUT Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?</p>
<p>BOTTOM A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanac 466 . Find out
moonshine, find out moonshine.</p>
<p>They consult an almanac</p>
<p>[Robin may ] enter</p>
<p>QUINCE Yes, it doth shine that night.</p>
<p>BOTTOM Why, then may you leave a casement 467 of the great chamber
window, where we play, open, and the moon may shine in at the
casement.</p>
<p>QUINCE Ay, or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a
lantern 468 , and say he comes to disfigure 469 , or to present 470 ,
the person of Moonshine. Then there is another thing: we must have a
wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story, did
talk through the chink of a wall.</p>
<p>SNOUT You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?</p>
<p>BOTTOM Some man or other must present Wall: and let him have some
plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast 471 about him, to signify
wall; or let him hold his fingers thus; and through that cranny shall
Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.</p>
<p>Hand gesture suggesting a hole in a wall</p>
<p>QUINCE If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every
mother’s son, and rehearse 472 your parts. Pyramus, you begin: when you
have spoken your speech, enter into that brake, and so every one
according to his cue.</p>
<p>Robin [may ] enter</p>
<p>ROBIN What hempen home-spuns 473 have we swagg’ring 474 here,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>So near the cradle 475 of the fairy queen?</p>
<p>What, a play toward 476 ? I’ll be an auditor,</p>
<p>An actor too perhaps, if I see cause.</p>
<p>QUINCE Speak, Pyramus.— Thisbe, stand forth.</p>
<p>PYRAMUS [BOTTOM] Thisbe, the flowers of odious savours sweet—</p>
<p>QUINCE Odours, odours.</p>
<p>PYRAMUS [BOTTOM] —odours savours sweet,</p>
<p>So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear.</p>
<p>But hark, a voice! Stay thou but here awhile,</p>
<p>And by and by 477 I will to thee appear.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>ROBIN A stranger Pyramus than e’er played here.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>THISBE [FLUTE] Must I speak now?</p>
<p>QUINCE Ay, marry, must you, for you must understand he goes but to
see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.</p>
<p>THISBE [FLUTE] Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,</p>
<p>Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,</p>
<p>Most brisky juvenal 478 and eke 479 most lovely Jew 480 ,</p>
<p>As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,</p>
<p>I’ll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny’s tomb.</p>
<p>QUINCE ‘Ninus 481’ tomb’, man! Why, you must not speak that yet; that
you answer to Pyramus. You speak all your part 482 at once, cues and
all. Pyramus, enter: your cue is past; it is, ‘never tire’.</p>
<p>THISBE [FLUTE] O — As true as truest horse that yet would never
tire.</p>
<p>Enter [Robin and ] Pyramus [Bottom ] with the ass head</p>
<p>PYRAMUS [BOTTOM] If I were fair 483 , Thisbe, I were 484 only
thine.</p>
<p>QUINCE O monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray, masters! Fly,
masters! Help!</p>
<p>The Clowns all exit</p>
<p>ROBIN I’ll follow you, I’ll lead you about a round 485 ,</p>
<p>Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier.</p>
<p>Sometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound,</p>
<p>A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire 486 ,</p>
<p>And neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn,</p>
<p>Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>If Bottom exited with the other clowns, he re-enters here</p>
<p>BOTTOM Why do they run away? This is a knavery 487 of them to make me
afeard.</p>
<p>Enter Snout</p>
<p>SNOUT O Bottom, thou art changed! What do I see on thee?</p>
<p>BOTTOM What do you see? You see an asshead of your own, do you?</p>
<p>[Exit Snout ]</p>
<p>Enter Quince</p>
<p>QUINCE Bless thee, Bottom! Bless thee! Thou art translated 488 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>BOTTOM I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me, to fright
me, if they could; but I will not stir from this place, do what they
can. I will walk up and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear
I am not afraid.</p>
<p>The ousel cock 489 so black of hue,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>With orange-tawny bill,</p>
<p>The throstle 490 with his note so true,</p>
<p>The wren with little quill 491 —</p>
<p>TITANIA What angel wakes me from my flow’ry bed?</p>
<p>Wakes</p>
<p>BOTTOM The finch, the sparrow and the lark,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>The plain-song 492 cuckoo grey,</p>
<p>Whose note full many a man doth mark,</p>
<p>And dares not answer nay 493 —</p>
<p>For, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird 494 ? Who
would give a bird the lie 495 , though he cry ‘cuckoo 496’ never so 497
?</p>
<p>TITANIA I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:</p>
<p>Mine ear is much enamoured of thy note;</p>
<p>So is mine eye enthrallèd 498 to thy shape:</p>
<p>And thy fair virtue’s 499 force perforce 500 doth move me</p>
<p>On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.</p>
<p>BOTTOM Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that:
and yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together
nowadays; the more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make
them friends. Nay, I can gleek 501 upon occasion.</p>
<p>TITANIA Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.</p>
<p>BOTTOM Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out of this
wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn 502 .</p>
<p>TITANIA Out of this wood do not desire to go:</p>
<p>Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt 503 or no.</p>
<p>I am a spirit of no common rate 504 .</p>
<p>The summer still 505 doth tend upon 506 my state 507 ,</p>
<p>And I do love thee: therefore, go with me.</p>
<p>I’ll give thee fairies to attend on thee,</p>
<p>And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep 508 ,</p>
<p>And sing while thou on pressèd flowers dost sleep.</p>
<p>And I will purge thy mortal grossness 509 so</p>
<p>That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.</p>
<p>Peaseblossom 510 , Cobweb, Moth 511 , Mustardseed!</p>
<p>Enter four Fairies</p>
<p>PEASEBLOSSOM Ready.</p>
<p>COBWEB And I.</p>
<p>MOTH And I.</p>
<p>MUSTARDSEED And I.</p>
<p>ALL Where shall we go?</p>
<p>TITANIA Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.</p>
<p>Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes 512 ,</p>
<p>Feed him with apricocks 513 and dewberries 514 ,</p>
<p>With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.</p>
<p>The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees 515 ,</p>
<p>And for night-tapers 516 crop their waxen thighs</p>
<p>And light them at the fiery glow-worm’s eyes,</p>
<p>To have my love to bed and to arise 517 .</p>
<p>And pluck the wings from painted butterflies</p>
<p>To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.</p>
<p>Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.</p>
<p>PEASEBLOSSOM Hail, mortal!</p>
<p>COBWEB Hail!</p>
<p>MOTH Hail!</p>
<p>MUSTARDSEED Hail!</p>
<p>BOTTOM I cry your worship’s mercy 518 , heartily; I beseech your
worship’s name.</p>
<p>To Cobweb</p>
<p>COBWEB Cobweb.</p>
<p>BOTTOM I shall desire you of more acquaintance 519 , good Master
Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you 520 .— Your name,
honest gentleman?</p>
<p>PEASEBLOSSOM Peaseblossom.</p>
<p>BOTTOM I pray you commend me to Mistress Squash 521 , your mother,
and to Master Peascod 522 , your father. Good Master Peaseblossom, I
shall desire you of more acquaintance too.— Your name, I beseech you,
sir?</p>
<p>MUSTARDSEED Mustardseed.</p>
<p>BOTTOM Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience 523 well: that
same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your
house. I promise you, your kindred hath made my eyes water 524 ere now.
I desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Mustardseed.</p>
<p>TITANIA Come, wait upon him, lead him to my bower.</p>
<p>The moon methinks looks with a wat’ry eye,</p>
<p>And when she weeps 525 , weeps every little flower,</p>
<p>Lamenting some enforcèd 526 chastity.</p>
<p>Tie up my lover’s tongue 527 , bring him silently.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
