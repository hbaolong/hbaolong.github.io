<h4 id="scene-5-running-scene-10">Scene 5 / running scene 10</h4>
<p>Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Come thy ways 650 , Signior Fabian.</p>
<p>FABIAN Nay, I’ll come. If I lose a scruple 651 of this sport, let me
be boiled 652 to death with melancholy.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly 653 rascally
sheep-biter 654 come by some notable shame?</p>
<p>FABIAN I would exult, man. You know he brought me out o’favour with
my lady about a bear-baiting 655 here.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY To anger him we’ll have the bear again, and we will fool him
black and blue 656 . Shall we not, Sir Andrew?</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW An we do not, it is pity of our lives 657 .</p>
<p>Enter Maria</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Here comes the little villain.— How now, my metal of India
658 ?</p>
<p>To Maria</p>
<p>MARIA Get ye all three into the box-tree 659 : Malvolio’s coming down
this walk 660 . He has been yonder i’the sun practising behaviour 661 to
his own shadow this half hour.</p>
<p>Observe him, for the love of mockery, for I know this letter will
make a contemplative 662 idiot of him. Close 663 , in the name of
jesting! Lie thou there, for here comes the trout that must be caught
with tickling 664 .</p>
<p>They hide</p>
<p>Puts a letter on the ground</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Malvolio</p>
<p>↓Sir Toby and the others are not heard by Malvolio ↓</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ’Tis but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once told me she 665
did affect 666 me, and I have heard herself come thus near 667 , that
should she fancy 668 , it should be one of my complexion. Besides, she
uses 669 me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows
670 her. What should I think on’t?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Here’s an overweening 671 rogue!</p>
<p>FABIAN O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare 672 turkey-cock 673 of
him. How he jets 674 under his advanced plumes 675 !</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW ’Slight 676 , I could so beat the rogue!</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Peace, I say.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO To be Count Malvolio!</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Ah, rogue!</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Pistol 677 him, pistol him.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Peace, peace!</p>
<p>MALVOLIO There is example 678 for’t: the lady of the Strachy married
the yeoman of the wardrobe 679 680 .</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Fie on him, Jezebel 681 !</p>
<p>FABIAN O, peace! Now he’s deeply in 682 : look how imagination blows
him 683 .</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Having been three months married to her, sitting in my state
684 —</p>
<p>SIR TOBY O, for a stone-bow 685 to hit him in the eye!</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Calling my officers 686 about me, in my branched 687 velvet
gown, having come from a daybed 688 , where I have left Olivia
sleeping—</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Fire and brimstone!</p>
<p>FABIAN O, peace, peace!</p>
<p>MALVOLIO And then to have the humour of state 689 , and after a
demure travel of regard 690 , telling them I know my place as I would
691 they should do theirs, to ask for my kinsman Toby 692 —</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Bolts and shackles! 693</p>
<p>FABIAN O peace, peace, peace! Now, now.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Seven of my people 694 , with an obedient start 695 , make
out 696 for him. I frown the while, and perchance 697 wind up my watch,
or play with my— 698 some rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies 699
there to me—</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Shall this fellow live?</p>
<p>FABIAN Though our silence be drawn from us with cars 700 , yet
peace.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar 701
smile with an austere regard of control 702 —</p>
<p>SIR TOBY And does not Toby take 703 you a blow o’the lips then?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Saying, ‘Cousin 704 Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your
niece give me this prerogative 705 of speech’—</p>
<p>SIR TOBY What, what?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ‘You must amend your drunkenness.’</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Out, scab 706 !</p>
<p>FABIAN Nay, patience, or we break the sinews 707 of our plot.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ‘Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish
knight’—</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW That’s me, I warrant you.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ‘One Sir Andrew’—</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW I knew ’twas I, for many do call me fool.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO What employment 708 have we here?</p>
<p>Picks up the letter</p>
<p>FABIAN Now is the woodcock 709 near the gin 710 .</p>
<p>SIR TOBY O, peace! And the spirit of humours 711 intimate 712 reading
aloud to him.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO By my life, this is my lady’s hand 713 these be her very
C’s, her U’s and her T’s 714 , and thus makes she her great P’s 715 . It
is in contempt of 716 question her hand.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Her C’s, her U’s and her T’s. Why that?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ‘To the unknown beloved, this, and my good wishes.’ Her very
phrases!</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>By your leave, wax. Soft! And the impressure 717 her Lucrece 718 ,
with which she uses to seal 719 . ’Tis my lady. To whom should this
be?</p>
<p>FABIAN This wins him, liver 720 and all.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ’Jove knows I love,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>But who?</p>
<p>Lips, do not move.</p>
<p>No man must know.’</p>
<p>‘No man must know.’ What follows? The numbers altered 721 ! ‘No man
must know.’</p>
<p>If this should be thee, Malvolio?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Marry, hang thee, brock 722 !</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ’I may command where I adore,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>But silence, like a Lucrece knife 723 ,</p>
<p>With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:</p>
<p>M.O.A.I. doth sway 724 my life.’</p>
<p>FABIAN A fustian 725 riddle!</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Excellent wench, say I.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ‘M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.’ Nay, but first let me see, let
me see, let me see.</p>
<p>FABIAN What 726 dish o’poison has she dressed 727 him.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY And with what wing 728 the staniel 729 checks 730 at it!</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ‘I may command where I adore.’ Why, she may command me! I
serve her, she is my lady. Why, this is evident to any formal capacity
731 . There is no obstruction 732 in this. And the end — what should
that alphabetical position 733 portend 734 ? If I could make that
resemble something in me. Softly: M.O.A.I.—</p>
<p>SIR TOBY O, ay 735 , make up 736 that. He is now at a cold scent 737
.</p>
<p>FABIAN Sowter 738 will cry 739 upon’t for all this, though it be as
rank 740 as a fox.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO M. — Malvolio. M. — Why, that begins my name!</p>
<p>FABIAN Did not I say he would work it out? The cur 741 is excellent
at faults 742 .</p>
<p>MALVOLIO M. — But then there is no consonancy in the sequel 743 that
suffers 744 under probation 745 : ‘A’ should follow but ‘O’ does.</p>
<p>FABIAN And O shall end 746 , I hope.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Ay, or I’ll cudgel him, and make him cry O!</p>
<p>MALVOLIO And then I comes behind.</p>
<p>FABIAN Ay, an you had any eye 747 behind you, you might see more
detraction 748 at your heels than fortunes before you.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO M.O.A.I. This simulation 749 is not as the former 750 . And
yet, to crush 751 this a little, it would bow 752 to me, for every one
of these letters are in my name. Soft, here follows prose: ’If this fall
into thy hand, revolve 753 . In my stars 754 I am above thee, but be not
afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and
some have greatness thrust upon ’em. Thy Fates open their hands 755 .
Let thy blood and spirit 756 embrace 757 them. And to inure 758 thyself
to what thou art like 759 to be, cast 760 thy humble slough 761 and
appear fresh. Be opposite 762 with a kinsman, surly with servants. Let
thy tongue tang arguments of state 763 ; put thyself into the trick of
singularity 764 . She thus advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember
who commended thy yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever 765
cross-gartered 766 . I say, remember. Go to 767 , thou art made, if thou
desirest to be so. If not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow
of servants, and not worthy to touch Fortune’s fingers. Farewell. She
that would alter services 768 with thee,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>The Fortunate-Unhappy 769 .’</p>
<p>Daylight and champaign 770 discovers 771 not more. This is open 772 .
I will be proud, I will read politic 773 authors, I will baffle 774 Sir
Toby, I will wash off gross 775 acquaintance, I will be point-device 776
the very man. I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade 777 me;
for every reason excites 778 to this, that my lady loves me. She did
commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being
cross-gartered. And in this she manifests herself to 779 my love, and
with a kind of injunction 780 drives me to these habits 781 of her
liking. I thank my stars, I am happy 782 . I will be strange 783 , stout
784 , in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness
of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a postscript:
‘Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou entertainest 785 my
love, let it appear in thy smiling. Thy smiles become thee well:
therefore in my presence still 786 smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.’
Jove, I thank thee. I will smile. I will do everything that thou wilt
have me.</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian come out of hiding</p>
<p>FABIAN I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of
thousands to be paid from the Sophy 787 .</p>
<p>SIR TOBY I could marry this wench for this device 788 .</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW So could I too.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.</p>
<p>Enter Maria</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Nor I neither.</p>
<p>FABIAN Here comes my noble gull-catcher 789 .</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Wilt thou set thy foot o’my neck? 790</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Or o’mine either?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Shall I play 791 my freedom at tray-trip 792 , and become
thy bondslave 793 ?</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW I’faith, or I either?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Why, thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image
of it leaves him, he must run mad.</p>
<p>MARIA Nay, but say true, does it work upon him?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Like aqua-vitae 794 with a midwife.</p>
<p>MARIA If you will then see the fruits 795 of the sport, mark his
first approach before my lady: he will come to her in yellow stockings,
and ’tis a colour she abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests.
And he will smile upon her, which will now be so unsuitable to her
disposition, being addicted to a melancholy as she is, that it cannot
but turn him into a notable contempt 796 . If you will see it, follow
me.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY To the gates of Tartar 797 , thou most excellent devil of
wit!</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW I’ll make one 798 too.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
