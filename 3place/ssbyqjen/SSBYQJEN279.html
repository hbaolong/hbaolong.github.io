<h4 id="scene-4-running-scene-13">Scene 4 / running scene 13</h4>
<p>Enter Olivia and Maria</p>
<p>OLIVIA I have sent after him 980 : he says he’ll come.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>How shall I feast him? What bestow of 981 him?</p>
<p>For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrowed.</p>
<p>I speak too loud.—</p>
<p>Where’s Malvolio? He is sad 982 and civil 983 ,</p>
<p>And suits well for a servant with my fortunes.</p>
<p>Where is Malvolio?</p>
<p>MARIA He’s coming, madam, but in very strange manner. He is sure
possessed 984 , madam.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Why, what’s the matter? Does he rave?</p>
<p>MARIA No, madam, he does nothing but smile: your ladyship were best
to have some guard about you, if he come, for sure the man is tainted
in’s wits.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Go call him hither.— I am as mad as he,</p>
<p>Maria goes to call Malvolio</p>
<p>If sad and merry madness equal be.</p>
<p>Enter Malvolio [cross-gartered and in yellow stockings ]</p>
<p>How now, Malvolio?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Sweet lady, ho, ho.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Smilest thou? I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Sad, lady? I could be sad 985 : this does make some
obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering, but what of that? If it
please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet 986 is,
‘Please one, and please all’ 987 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Not black 988 in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It 989
did come to his 990 hands, and commands shall be executed. I think we do
know the sweet Roman hand 991 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA Wilt thou go to bed 992 , Malvolio?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO To bed? Ay, sweetheart, and I’ll come to thee.</p>
<p>OLIVIA God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand 993
so oft?</p>
<p>MARIA How do you, Malvolio?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO At your request! Yes, nightingales answer daws 994 .</p>
<p>MARIA Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my
lady?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ‘Be not afraid of greatness.’ ’Twas well writ.</p>
<p>OLIVIA What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ‘Some are born great’—</p>
<p>OLIVIA Ha?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ‘Some achieve greatness’—</p>
<p>OLIVIA What say’st thou?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ‘And some have greatness thrust upon them.’</p>
<p>OLIVIA Heaven restore thee!</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ‘Remember who commended thy yellow stockings’—</p>
<p>OLIVIA Thy yellow stockings?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ‘And wished to see thee cross-gartered.’</p>
<p>OLIVIA Cross-gartered?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ‘Go to, thou art made, if thou desirest to be so’—</p>
<p>OLIVIA Am I made?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO ‘If not, let me see thee a servant still.’</p>
<p>OLIVIA Why, this is very midsummer 995 madness.</p>
<p>Enter Servant</p>
<p>SERVANT Madam, the young gentleman of the count Orsino’s is returned.
I could hardly 996 entreat him back. He attends 997 your ladyship’s
pleasure.</p>
<p>OLIVIA I’ll come to him.</p>
<p>[Exit Servant ]</p>
<p>Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where’s my cousin Toby? Let
some of my people have a special care of him. I would not have him
miscarry 998 for the half of my dowry.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Olivia and Maria ]</p>
<p>MALVOLIO O, ho! Do you come near 999 me now? No worse man than Sir
Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him
on purpose that I may appear stubborn to him, for she incites me to that
in the letter. ‘Cast thy humble slough,’ says she, ‘be opposite with a
kinsman, surly with servants, let thy tongue tang with arguments of
state, put thyself into the trick of singularity.’ And consequently 1000
sets down the manner how: as, a sad face, a reverend carriage 1001 , a
slow tongue, in the habit 1002 of some sir of note 1003 , and so forth.
I have limed 1004 her, but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me
thankful. And when she went away now, ‘Let this fellow be looked to.’
Fellow 1005 ? Not Malvolio, nor after my degree 1006 , but fellow. Why,
everything adheres together, that no dram 1007 of a scruple 1008 , no
scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous 1009 or unsafe 1010
circumstance — What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me
and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of
this, and he is to be thanked.</p>
<p>Enter Toby, Fabian and Maria</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils
of hell be drawn in little 1011 , and Legion 1012 himself possessed him,
yet I’ll speak to him.</p>
<p>FABIAN Here he is, here he is. How is’t with you, sir? How is’t with
you, man?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Go off. I discard you. Let me enjoy my private 1013 . Go
off.</p>
<p>MARIA Lo 1014 , how hollow 1015 the fiend speaks within him! Did not
I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a 1016 care of him.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Ah, ha, does she so?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Go to, go to. Peace, peace. We must deal gently with him.
Let me alone 1017 .—How do you, Malvolio? How is’t with you? What, man,
defy the devil! Consider, he’s an enemy to mankind.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Do you know what you say?</p>
<p>MARIA La 1018 you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at
heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!</p>
<p>FABIAN Carry his water 1019 to th’wise woman 1020 .</p>
<p>MARIA Marry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning, if I live. My
lady would not lose him for more than I’ll say.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO How now, mistress?</p>
<p>MARIA O Lord!</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Prithee hold thy peace, this is not the way. Do you not see
you move 1021 him?</p>
<p>Let me alone with him.</p>
<p>FABIAN No way but gentleness, gently, gently. The fiend is rough, and
will not be roughly used.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Why, how now, my bawcock 1022 ? How dost thou, chuck 1023
?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Sir!</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Ay, Biddy 1024 , come with me. What, man, ’tis not for
gravity 1025 to play at cherry-pit 1026 with Satan. Hang him, foul
collier 1027 !</p>
<p>MARIA Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO My prayers, minx?</p>
<p>MARIA No, I warrant you he will not hear of godliness.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Go, hang yourselves all! You are idle 1028 shallow things. I
am not of your element 1029 . You shall know more hereafter.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Is’t possible?</p>
<p>FABIAN If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an
improbable fiction.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY His very genius 1030 hath taken the infection of the device,
man.</p>
<p>MARIA Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint 1031
.</p>
<p>FABIAN Why, we shall make him mad indeed.</p>
<p>MARIA The house will be the quieter.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Come, we’ll have him in a dark room and bound 1032 . My
niece is already in the belief that he’s mad. We may carry 1033 it thus,
for our pleasure and his penance, till our very pastime, tired out of
breath, prompt us to have mercy on him, at which time we will bring the
device to the bar 1034 and crown thee for a finder of madmen 1035 . But
see, but see.</p>
<p>Enter Sir Andrew</p>
<p>FABIAN More matter 1036 for a May morning 1037 .</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Here’s the challenge, read it. I warrant 1038 there’s
vinegar and pepper in’t.</p>
<p>Shows a paper</p>
<p>FABIAN Is’t so saucy 1039 ?</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Ay, is’t, I warrant 1040 him. Do but read.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Give me. ‘Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy
1041 fellow.’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>FABIAN Good, and valiant.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY ‘Wonder not, nor admire 1042 not in thy mind, why I do call
thee so, for I will show thee no reason for’t.’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>FABIAN A good note 1043 , that keeps 1044 you from the blow of the
law 1045 .</p>
<p>SIR TOBY ‘Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses
thee kindly. But thou liest in thy throat 1046 , that is not the matter
I challenge thee for.’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>FABIAN Very brief, and to exceeding good sense— less.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>SIR TOBY ‘I will waylay thee going home, where if it be thy chance to
kill me’—</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>FABIAN Good.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY ‘Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>FABIAN Still you keep o’th’windy 1047 side of the law. Good.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY ’Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon one of our souls!
He may have mercy upon mine, but my hope 1048 is better, and so look to
thyself. Thy friend, as thou usest him 1049 , and thy sworn enemy,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>Andrew Aguecheek.’</p>
<p>If this letter move 1050 him not, his legs cannot. I’ll give’t
him.</p>
<p>MARIA You may have very fit occasion for’t: he is now in some
commerce 1051 with my lady, and will by and by depart.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Go, Sir Andrew. Scout me 1052 for him at the corner of the
orchard like a bumbaily 1053 : so soon as ever thou see’st him, draw,
and as thou draw’st swear horrible 1054 , for it comes to pass oft that
a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off 1055 ,
gives manhood more approbation 1056 than ever proof 1057 itself would
have earned him. Away!</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Nay, let me alone 1058 for swearing.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Now will not I deliver his letter, for the behaviour of the
young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity 1059 and breeding.
His employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore
this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the
youth. He will find it comes from a clodpole 1060 . But, sir, I will
deliver his challenge by word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable
report of valour, and drive the gentleman, as I know his youth 1061 will
aptly receive 1062 it, into a most hideous 1063 opinion of his rage,
skill, fury and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that they
will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices 1064 .</p>
<p>Enter Olivia and Viola</p>
<p>FABIAN Here he comes with your niece. Give them way 1065 till he take
leave, and presently 1066 after him.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY I will meditate the while upon some horrid 1067 message for
a challenge.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Sir Toby, Fabian and Maria ]</p>
<p>OLIVIA I have said too much unto a heart of stone</p>
<p>And laid 1068 mine honour too unchary 1069 on’t.</p>
<p>There’s something in me that reproves my fault,</p>
<p>But such a headstrong potent fault it is,</p>
<p>That it but mocks reproof.</p>
<p>VIOLA With the same ’haviour that your passion bears 1070</p>
<p>Goes on my master’s griefs.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Here, wear this jewel 1071 for me, ’tis my picture.</p>
<p>Refuse it not. It hath no tongue to vex you.</p>
<p>And I beseech you come again tomorrow.</p>
<p>What shall you ask of me that I’ll deny,</p>
<p>That honour saved 1072 may upon asking give?</p>
<p>VIOLA Nothing but this: your true love for my master.</p>
<p>OLIVIA How with mine honour may I give him that</p>
<p>Which I have given to you?</p>
<p>VIOLA I will acquit 1073 you.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Well, come again tomorrow. Fare thee well.</p>
<p>A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>Enter Toby and Fabian</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Gentleman, God save thee.</p>
<p>VIOLA And you, sir.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY That 1074 defence thou hast, betake 1075 thee to’t. Of what
nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not, but thy
intercepter 1076 , full of despite 1077 , bloody 1078 as the hunter,
attends thee at the orchard-end. Dismount 1079 thy tuck 1080 , be yare
1081 in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful and
deadly.</p>
<p>VIOLA You mistake, sir, I am sure. No man hath any quarrel to 1082
me: my remembrance 1083 is very free and clear from any image of offence
done to any man.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY You’ll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore, if you
hold your life at any price 1084 , betake you to your guard, for your
opposite 1085 hath in him what youth, strength, skill and wrath can
furnish man withal 1086 .</p>
<p>VIOLA I pray you, sir, what is he?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY He is knight, dubbed 1087 with unhatched 1088 rapier and on
carpet consideration 1089 , but he is a devil in private brawl. Souls
and bodies hath he divorced three, and his incensement 1090 at this
moment is so implacable that satisfaction 1091 can be none but by pangs
of death and sepulchre 1092 . Hob, nob 1093 , is his word 1094 : give’t
or take’t.</p>
<p>VIOLA I will return again into the house and desire some conduct 1095
of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put
quarrels purposely on others, to taste 1096 their valour. Belike this is
a man of that quirk 1097 .</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Sir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very
competent 1098 injury: therefore, get you on and give him his desire.
Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that 1099 with me
which with as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on, or strip
your sword stark naked, for meddle 1100 you must, that’s certain, or
forswear to wear iron about you 1101 .</p>
<p>VIOLA This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you do me this
courteous office 1102 , as to know of 1103 the knight what my offence to
him is. It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman
till my return.</p>
<p>Exit Toby</p>
<p>VIOLA Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?</p>
<p>FABIAN I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal
arbitrement 1104 , but nothing of the circumstance more.</p>
<p>VIOLA I beseech you what manner of man is he?</p>
<p>FABIAN Nothing of that wonderful promise 1105 , to read 1106 him by
his form 1107 , as you are like 1108 to find him in the proof of his
valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful, bloody and fatal opposite
that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can.</p>
<p>VIOLA I shall be much bound to you for’t: I am one that had rather go
with sir priest than sir knight. I care not who knows so much of my
mettle 1109 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Enter Toby and Andrew</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Why, man, he’s a very devil. I have not seen such a firago
1110 . I had a pass 1111 with him, rapier, scabbard and all, and he
gives me the stuck in 1112 with such a mortal 1113 motion 1114 that it
is inevitable 1115 . And on the answer 1116 , he pays you 1117 as surely
as your feet hits the ground they step on. They say he has been fencer
to 1118 the Sophy 1119 .</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Pox 1120 on’t, I’ll not meddle with him.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Ay, but he will not now be pacified. Fabian can scarce hold
1121 him yonder.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Plague on’t, an I thought he had been valiant and so
cunning 1122 in fence 1123 ,</p>
<p>I’d have seen him damned ere 1124 I’d have challenged him. Let him
let the matter slip, and I’ll give him my horse, grey Capilet.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY I’ll make the motion 1125 . Stand here, make a good show
on’t.— This shall end without the perdition 1126 of souls 1127 . Marry,
I’ll ride 1128 your horse as well as I ride you.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Enter Fabian and Viola</p>
<p>I have his horse to take up 1129 the quarrel. I have persuaded him
the youth’s a devil.</p>
<p>Aside to Fabian</p>
<p>FABIAN He is as horribly conceited 1130 of him, and pants and looks
pale, as if a bear were at his heels.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY There’s no remedy, sir, he will fight with you for’s oath
1131 sake. Marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel 1132 , and
he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw for the
supportance 1133 of his vow. He protests 1134 he will not hurt you.</p>
<p>To Viola</p>
<p>VIOLA Pray God defend me! A little thing would 1135 make me tell them
how much</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>I lack of a man.</p>
<p>FABIAN Give ground if you see him furious.</p>
<p>To Viola</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Come, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy. The gentleman will, for
his honour’s sake, have one bout with you. He cannot by the duello 1136
avoid it. But he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he
will not hurt you. Come on, to’t.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Pray God he keep his oath!</p>
<p>Enter Antonio</p>
<p>VIOLA I do assure you, ’tis against my will.</p>
<p>To Fabian/They draw their swords</p>
<p>ANTONIO Put up 1137 your sword. If this young gentleman</p>
<p>Have done offence, I take the fault on me.</p>
<p>If you offend him, I for him defy you.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY You, sir? Why, what are you?</p>
<p>ANTONIO One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more</p>
<p>Than you have heard him brag to you he will.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Nay, if you be an undertaker 1138 , I am for 1139 you.</p>
<p>They draw</p>
<p>Enter Officers</p>
<p>FABIAN O, good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY I’ll be with you anon 1140 .</p>
<p>To Antonio</p>
<p>VIOLA Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.</p>
<p>To Sir Andrew</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW Marry, will I, sir. And for that 1141 I promised you, I’ll
be as good as my word. He 1142 will bear you easily and reins 1143
well.</p>
<p>FIRST OFFICER This is the man; do thy office.</p>
<p>Indicates Antonio</p>
<p>SECOND OFFICER Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit 1144 of Count
Orsino.</p>
<p>ANTONIO You do mistake me, sir.</p>
<p>FIRST OFFICER No, sir, no jot. I know your favour 1145 well,</p>
<p>Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.</p>
<p>Take him away: he knows I know him well.</p>
<p>ANTONIO I must obey.— This comes with seeking you.</p>
<p>To Viola</p>
<p>But there’s no remedy, I shall answer 1146 it.</p>
<p>What will you do, now my necessity</p>
<p>Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me</p>
<p>Much more for what I cannot do for you</p>
<p>Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed 1147 ;</p>
<p>But be of comfort.</p>
<p>SECOND OFFICER Come, sir, away.</p>
<p>ANTONIO I must entreat of you some of that money.</p>
<p>To Viola</p>
<p>VIOLA What money, sir?</p>
<p>For the fair kindness you have showed me here,</p>
<p>And part 1148 being prompted by your present trouble,</p>
<p>Out of my lean and low ability</p>
<p>I’ll lend you something. My having 1149 is not much.</p>
<p>I’ll make division of my present 1150 with you.</p>
<p>Hold, there’s half my coffer 1151 .</p>
<p>Offers money</p>
<p>ANTONIO Will you deny 1152 me now?</p>
<p>Is’t possible that my deserts 1153 to you</p>
<p>Can lack persuasion 1154 ? Do not tempt 1155 my misery,</p>
<p>Lest that it make me so unsound 1156 a man</p>
<p>As to upbraid you with those kindnesses</p>
<p>That I have done for you.</p>
<p>VIOLA I know of none,</p>
<p>Nor know I you by voice or any feature.</p>
<p>I hate ingratitude more in a man</p>
<p>Than lying, vainness 1157 , babbling, drunkenness,</p>
<p>Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption</p>
<p>Inhabits our frail blood.</p>
<p>ANTONIO O heavens themselves!</p>
<p>SECOND OFFICER Come, sir, I pray you go.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here</p>
<p>I snatched one half out of the jaws of death,</p>
<p>Relieved him with such sanctity 1158 of love,</p>
<p>And to his image 1159 , which methought did promise</p>
<p>Most venerable worth 1160 , did I devotion.</p>
<p>FIRST OFFICER What’s that to us? The time goes by. Away!</p>
<p>ANTONIO But O, how vile an idol proves this god.</p>
<p>Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature 1161 shame.</p>
<p>In nature there’s no blemish but the mind.</p>
<p>None can be called deformed but the unkind 1162 .</p>
<p>Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil</p>
<p>Are empty trunks 1163 o’erflourished 1164 by the devil.</p>
<p>FIRST OFFICER The man grows mad. Away with him! Come, come, sir.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Lead me on.</p>
<p>Exit [with Officers ]</p>
<p>VIOLA Methinks his words do from such passion fly,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>That he believes himself, so do not I.</p>
<p>Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,</p>
<p>That I, dear brother, be now ta’en for you!</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Come hither, knight. Come hither, Fabian. We’ll whisper o’er
a couplet or two of most sage 1165 saws 1166 .</p>
<p>They stand aside</p>
<p>VIOLA He named Sebastian. I my brother know</p>
<p>Yet living in my glass 1167 , even such and so</p>
<p>In favour 1168 was my brother, and he went 1169</p>
<p>Still 1170 in this fashion, colour, ornament 1171 ,</p>
<p>For him I imitate. O, if it prove 1172 ,</p>
<p>Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>SIR TOBY A very dishonest 1173 paltry boy, and more a coward 1174
than a hare. His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in
necessity and denying him. And for his cowardship, ask Fabian.</p>
<p>FABIAN A coward, a most devout coward, religious 1175 in it.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW ’Slid 1176 , I’ll after him again and beat him.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Do, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW An I do not—</p>
<p>FABIAN Come, let’s see the event 1177 .</p>
<p>SIR TOBY I dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet 1178 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
