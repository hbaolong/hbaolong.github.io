10</h4>
<p>Enter Falstaff and Bardolph</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely 1262 since this last
action 1263 ? Do I not bate 1264 ? Do I not dwindle? Why my skin hangs
about me like an old lady’s loose gown. I am withered like an old
apple-john 1265 . Well, I’ll repent, and that suddenly 1266 , while I am
in some liking 1267 . I shall be out of heart 1268 shortly, and then I
shall have no strength 1269 to repent. An I have not forgotten what the
inside of a church is made of, I am a peppercorn 1270 , a brewer’s horse
1271 . The inside of a church! Company, villainous company, hath been
the spoil of me.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Sir John, you are so fretful 1272 , you cannot live
long.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Why, there is it 1273 : come sing me a bawdy song, make me
merry. I was as virtuously given 1274 as a gentleman need to be;
virtuous enough: swore little, diced not — above seven times a week,
went to a bawdy-house 1275 not above once in a quarter — of an hour,
paid money that I borrowed — three of four times, lived well and in good
compass 1276 : and now I live out of all order, out of compass.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of
all compass, out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Do thou amend thy face, and I’ll amend my life: thou art our
admiral 1277 , thou bearest the lantern in the poop 1278 , but ’tis in
the nose 1279 of thee; thou art the Knight of the Burning Lamp 1280
.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF No, I’ll be sworn, I make as good use of it as many a man
doth of a death’s-head 1281 or a memento mori 1282 : I never see thy
face but I think upon hellfire and Dives that lived in purple 1283 , for
there he is in his robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way given
to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath should be ‘By this fire’,
but thou art altogether given over 1284 ; and wert indeed, but for the
light in thy face, the son of utter darkness. When thou ran’st up Gad’s
Hill in the night to catch my horse, if I did not think that thou hadst
been an ignis fatuus 1285 or a ball of wildfire 1286 , there’s no
purchase 1287 in money. O, thou art a perpetual triumph, an everlasting
bonfire-light 1288 ! Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links 1289
and torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern.
But the sack that thou hast drunk me 1290 would have bought me lights as
good cheap 1291 as the dearest chandler’s 1292 in Europe. I have
maintained that salamander 1293 of yours with fire any time this two and
thirty years. Heaven reward me for it!</p>
<p>BARDOLPH I would my face were in your belly! 1294</p>
<p>FALSTAFF So should I be sure to be heart-burned 1295 .</p>
<p>Enter Hostess [Quickly ]</p>
<p>How now, Dame Partlet 1296 the hen! Have you inquired yet who picked
my pocket?</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? Do you
think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched, I have inquired, so
has my husband, man by man, boy by boy, servant by servant. The tithe
1297 of a hair was never lost in my house before.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved 1298 and lost many a
hair; and I’ll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go to, you are a woman
1299 , go.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Who, I? I defy thee. I was never called so in mine
own house before.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Go to, I know 1300 you well enough.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY No, Sir John, you do not know me, Sir John. I know
you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John, and now you pick a quarrel to
beguile 1301 me of it. I bought you a dozen of shirts to your back 1302
.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Dowlas 1303 , filthy dowlas: I have given them away to
bakers’ wives, and they have made bolters 1304 of them.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Now, as I am a true woman, holland 1305 of eight
shillings an ell 1306 . You owe money here besides, Sir John, for your
diet and by-drinkings 1307 , and money lent you, four and twenty
pounds.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF He had his part of it, let him pay.</p>
<p>Points to Bardolph</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY He? Alas, he is poor, he hath nothing.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF How? Poor? Look upon his face. What call you rich? Let them
coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks. I’ll not pay a denier 1308 .
What, will you make a younker 1309 of me? Shall I not take mine ease
1310 in mine inn but I shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
seal-ring 1311 of my grandfather’s worth forty mark 1312 .</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY I have heard the prince tell him, I know not how oft,
that that ring was copper!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF How? The prince is a jack 1313 , a sneak-cup 1314 . An if he
were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he would say so.</p>
<p>Enter the Prince marching [with Peto ], and Falstaff meets him
playing on his truncheon 1315 like a fife</p>
<p>How now, lad? is the wind in that door? 1316 1317 Must we all
march?</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion 1318 .</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY My lord, I pray you hear me.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What say’st thou, Mistress Quickly? How does thy
husband? I love him well. He is an honest man.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Good my lord, hear me.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Prithee let her alone, and list to me.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What say’st thou, Jack?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras and had
my pocket picked. This house is turned bawdy-house: they pick pockets
1319 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What didst thou lose, Jack?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Wilt thou believe me, Hal, three or four bonds 1320 of forty
pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my grandfather’s?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY A trifle, some eight-penny matter.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your grace
say so. And, my lord, he speaks most vilely of you, like a foul-mouthed
man as he is, and said he would cudgel you.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What? He did not?</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY There’s neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me
else.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF There’s no more faith in thee than a stewed prune 1321 , nor
no more truth in thee than in a drawn fox 1322 . And for womanhood, Maid
Marian 1323 may be the deputy’s wife of the ward 1324 to 1325 thee. Go,
you nothing 1326 , go.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Say, what thing 1327 ? What thing?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What thing? Why, a thing to thank heaven on 1328 .</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY I am no thing to thank heaven on, I would thou
shouldst know it. I am an honest man’s wife, and, setting thy knighthood
1329 aside, thou art a knave to call me so.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say
otherwise.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What beast? Why, an otter 1330 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY An otter, Sir John? Why an otter?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Why? She’s neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not where to
have 1331 her.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Thou art an unjust man in saying so; thou or any man
knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Thou say’st true, hostess, and he slanders thee most
grossly.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you
owed him a thousand pound.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF A thousand pound, Hal? A million. Thy love is worth a
million: thou ow’st me thy love.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would
cudgel you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Did I, Bardolph?</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Indeed, Sir John, you said so.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Yea, if he said my ring was copper.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I say ’tis copper. Dar’st thou be as good as thy word
now?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Why, Hal, thou know’st, as thou art but a man, I dare, but
as thou art a prince, I fear thee as I fear the roaring of the lion’s
whelp 1332 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY And why not as the lion?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF The king himself is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
think I’ll fear thee as I fear thy father? Nay, if I do, let my girdle
break 1333 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy
knees! But, sirrah, there’s no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in
this bosom of thine: it is all filled up with guts and midriff. Charge
an honest woman with picking thy pocket? Why, thou whoreson, impudent,
embossed 1334 rascal 1335 , if there were anything in thy pocket but
tavern-reck’nings, memorandums 1336 of bawdy-houses, and one poor
penny-worth of sugar-candy to make thee long-winded 1337 : if thy pocket
were enriched with any other injuries 1338 but these, I am a villain.
And yet you will stand to it 1339 , you will not pocket up 1340 wrong.
Art thou not ashamed?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Dost thou hear, Hal? Thou know’st in the state of innocency
Adam fell, and what should poor Jack Falstaff do in the days of
villainy? Thou seest I have more flesh than another man, and therefore
more frailty 1341 . You confess then, you picked my pocket?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY It appears so by the story.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Hostess, I forgive thee. Go, make ready breakfast, love thy
husband, look to thy servants and cherish thy guests. Thou shalt find me
tractable to any honest reason: thou seest I am pacified still 1342 .
Nay, prithee be gone.—</p>
<p>Exit Hostess</p>
<p>Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery, lad, how is that
answered 1343 ?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY O, my sweet beef 1344 , I must still be good angel 1345
to thee. The money is paid back again.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF O, I do not like that paying back, ’tis a double labour 1346
.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I am good friends with my father and may do
anything.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Rob me the exchequer 1347 the first thing thou dost, and do
it with unwashed hands 1348 too.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Do, my lord.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot 1349 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find one that
can steal well? O, for a fine thief, of two-and-twenty or thereabout! I
am heinously unprovided 1350 . Well, God be thanked for these rebels,
they offend none but the virtuous 1351 . I laud 1352 them, I praise
them.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Bardolph.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH My lord?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster,</p>
<p>Gives letters</p>
<p>To my brother John. This to my lord of Westmorland.—</p>
<p>[Exit Bardolph ]</p>
<p>Go, Peto, to horse, for thou and I</p>
<p>Have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.—</p>
<p>[Exit Peto ]</p>
<p>Jack, meet me tomorrow in the Temple hall 1353</p>
<p>At two o’clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>There shalt thou know thy charge 1354 and there receive</p>
<p>Money and order for their furniture 1355 .</p>
<p>The land is burning, Percy stands on high,</p>
<p>And either they or we must lower lie.</p>
<p>[Exit Prince Henry ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Rare 1356 words! Brave 1357 world! Hostess, my breakfast,
come!</p>
<p>O, I could wish this tavern were my drum 1358 !</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
