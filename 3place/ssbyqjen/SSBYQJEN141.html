<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-4-continues">Scene 2 / running scene 4
continues</h4>
<p>Enter Dull, Holofernes the pedant 797 , and Nathaniel</p>
<p>NATHANIEL Very reverend 798 sport, truly, and done in the testimony
799 of a good conscience.</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES The deer was, as you know, sanguis , in blood 800 , ripe
as a pomewater 801 , who now 802 hangeth like a jewel in the ear of
caelo , the sky, the welkin, the heaven, and anon 803 falleth like a
crab 804 on the face of terra , the soil, the land, the earth.</p>
<p>NATHANIEL Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly varied,
like a scholar at the least 805 : but, sir, I assure ye, it was a buck
of the first head 806 .</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES Sir Nathaniel, haud credo 807 .</p>
<p>DULL ‘Twas not a ’auld grey doe’, ’twas a pricket 808 .</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES Most barbarous intimation 809 ! Yet a kind of insinuation
810 , as it were, in via , in way, of explication 811 , facere 812 , as
it were, replication 813 , or rather, ostentare , to show, as it were,
his inclination, after 814 his undressed 815 , unpolished, uneducated,
unpruned, untrained 816 , or rather, unlettered 817 , or ratherest 818
unconfirmed 819 fashion, to insert 820 again my haud credo for a
deer.</p>
<p>DULL I said the deer was not a haud credo , ’twas a pricket.</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES Twice-sod 821 simplicity, bis coctus 822 !</p>
<p>O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!</p>
<p>NATHANIEL Sir, he hath never fed of 823 the dainties that are bred in
a book. He hath not eat 824 paper, as it were. He hath not drunk ink.
His intellect is not replenished, he is only an animal, only sensible
825 in the duller parts.</p>
<p>And such barren plants are set before us that we thankful should
be,</p>
<p>Which 826 we of taste and feeling 827 are, for those parts that do
fructify 828 in us more than he.</p>
<p>For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,</p>
<p>So were there a patch set on learning 829 , to see him in a
school.</p>
<p>But omne bene 830 , say I, being of an old father’s mind 831 ,</p>
<p>Many can brook 832 the weather that love not the wind 833 .</p>
<p>DULL You two are bookmen: can you tell by your wit</p>
<p>What was a month old at Cain’s birth 834 that’s not five weeks old as
yet?</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES Dictynna 835 , goodman 836 Dull. Dictynna , goodman
Dull.</p>
<p>DULL What is dictima ?</p>
<p>NATHANIEL A title to Phoebe, to Luna 837 , to the moon.</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES The moon was a month old when Adam was no more 838 ,</p>
<p>And raught 839 not to five weeks when he came to fivescore 840 .</p>
<p>Th’allusion holds in the exchange 841 .</p>
<p>DULL ’Tis true indeed: the collusion 842 holds in the exchange.</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES God comfort 843 thy capacity 844 ! I say, th’allusion
holds in the exchange.</p>
<p>DULL And I say, the pollution 845 holds in the exchange, for the moon
is never but a month old: and I say beside that, ’twas a pricket that
the princess killed.</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal 846 epitaph on
the death of the deer? And, to humour the ignorant, called I the deer
the princess killed a pricket.</p>
<p>NATHANIEL Perge 847 , good Master Holofernes, perge , so it shall
please you to abrogate scurrility 848 .</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES I will something affect the letter 849 , for it argues
facility 850 .</p>
<p>The preyful 851 princess pierced and pricked a pretty pleasing
pricket 852 ,</p>
<p>Some say 853 a sore 854 , but not a sore 855 , till now made sore
with shooting 856 .</p>
<p>The dogs did yell, put ‘L’ 857 to sore, then sorrel 858 jumps from
thicket 859 .</p>
<p>Or pricket sore, or else sorrel 860 , the people fall a-hooting 861
.</p>
<p>If sore be sore 862 , then L to sore makes fifty sores 863 o’ 864
sorrel.</p>
<p>Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more ‘L’ 865 866
.</p>
<p>NATHANIEL A rare talent 867 .</p>
<p>DULL If a talent be a claw, look how he claws 868 him with a
talent.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES 869 This is a gift that I have, simple, simple: a foolish
870 extravagant spirit, full of forms 871 , figures 872 , shapes,
objects, ideas, apprehensions 873 , motions 874 , revolutions 875 .
These are begot 876 in the ventricle 877 of memory, nourished in the
womb of pia mater 878 , and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion 879
. But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful
for it.</p>
<p>NATHANIEL Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my parishioners,
for their sons are well tutored by you, and their daughters profit 880
very greatly under you 881 . You are a good member of the
commonwealth.</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES Mehercle 882 , if their sons be ingenious 883 , they shall
want 884 no instruction. If their daughters be capable 885 , I will put
it to them 886 . But vir sapit qui pauca loquitur 887 . A soul feminine
888 saluteth us.</p>
<p>Enter Jaquenetta and the Clown [Costard ]</p>
<p>JAQUENETTA God give you good morrow, Master Person 889 .</p>
<p>NATHANIEL Master Person, quasi 890 pierce-one? And if one should be
pierced, which is the one?</p>
<p>COSTARD Marry, Master Schoolmaster, he that is likest 891 to a
hogshead 892 .</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES Of piercing a hogshead 893 ! A good lustre of conceit 894
in a turf of earth 895 , fire enough for a flint, pearl enough for a
swine: ’tis pretty, it is well.</p>
<p>JAQUENETTA Good Master Parson, be so good as read me this letter. It
was given me by Costard, and sent me from Don Armado. I beseech you read
it.</p>
<p>Gives letterto Holofernes</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra ruminat
896 , — and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan, I may speak of thee as the
traveller doth of Venice:</p>
<p>Venetia , Venetia ,</p>
<p>Chi non ti vede non ti pretia 897 .</p>
<p>Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! Who understandeth thee not, loves thee
not?</p>
<p>Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa 898 . Under pardon 899 , sir, what are the
contents? Or rather, as Horace 900 says in his— What, my soul,
verses?</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>NATHANIEL Ay, sir, and very learned.</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES Let me hear a staff 901 , a stanza, a verse. Lege , domine
902 .</p>
<p>NATHANIEL ’If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed.</p>
<p>Though to myself forsworn, to thee I’ll faithful prove.</p>
<p>Those thoughts to me were oaks 903 , to thee like osiers 904
bowed.</p>
<p>Study his bias leaves and makes his book 905 thine eyes,</p>
<p>Where all those pleasures live that art 906 would comprehend.</p>
<p>If knowledge be the mark 907 , to know thee shall suffice:</p>
<p>Well learnèd is that tongue that well can thee commend,</p>
<p>All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder,</p>
<p>Which is 908 to me some praise that I thy parts 909 admire.</p>
<p>Thy eye Jove 910 ’s lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful
thunder,</p>
<p>Which not to anger bent 911 , is music and sweet fire.</p>
<p>Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,</p>
<p>That sings heaven’s praise with such an earthly tongue.’</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES You find not the apostrophus 912 , and so miss the accent
913 . Let me supervise 914 the canzonet 915 . Here are only numbers
ratified 916 , but for the elegancy, facility, and golden cadence of
poesy, caret 917 . Ovidius Naso 918 was the man: and why indeed ‘Naso’,
but for smelling out the odoriferous 919 flowers of fancy 920 , the
jerks 921 of invention? Imitari 922 is nothing: so doth the hound his
master, the ape his keeper, the tired horse his rider. But, damosella
923 virgin, was this directed to you?</p>
<p>Takes the letter</p>
<p>JAQUENETTA Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Berowne, one of the strange 924
queen’s lords.</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES I will overglance 925 the superscript 926 : ‘To the
snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady Rosaline.’ I will look again
on the intellect 927 of the letter, for the nomination 928 of the party
writing to the person written unto: ‘Your ladyship’s in all desired
employment 929 , Berowne.’</p>
<p>NATHANIEL Sir Holofernes, this Berowne is one of the votaries with
the king; and here he hath framed 930 a letter to a sequent 931 of the
stranger queen’s, which accidentally, or by the way of progression 932 ,
hath miscarried. Trip and go 933 , my sweet, deliver this paper into the
hand of the king: it may concern much 934 . Stay not thy compliment 935
: I forgive thy duty 936 , adieu.</p>
<p>JAQUENETTA Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life.</p>
<p>COSTARD Have with thee 937 , my girl.</p>
<p>Exit [Costard with Jaquenetta ]</p>
<p>NATHANIEL Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very
religiously: and as a certain father 938 saith—</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES Sir tell me not of the father, I do fear colourable
colours 939 . But to return to the verses: did they please you, Sir
Nathaniel?</p>
<p>NATHANIEL Marvellous well for the pen 940 .</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES I do dine today at the father’s of a certain pupil of
mine, where if, before repast, it shall please you to gratify the table
with a grace, I will, on my privilege I have with the parents of the
foresaid child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto 941 , where I will
prove those verses to be very unlearnèd, neither savouring of poetry,
wit, nor invention. I beseech your society 942 .</p>
<p>NATHANIEL And thank you too, for society, saith the text 943 , is the
happiness of life.</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES And, certes 944 , the text most infallibly concludes 945
it.— Sir, I do invite you too: you shall not say me nay. Pauca verba 946
. — Away, the gentles 947 are at their game 948 , and we will to our
recreation.</p>
<p>To Dull</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
