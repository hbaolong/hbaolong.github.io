to The Famous History of the Life of King Henry the Eighth</h4>
<p>Henry the Eighth, co-authored with John Fletcher, is the only English
history play of the second half of Shakespeare’s career, when his men
were under the patronage of King James I. Written at a time of nostalgia
for the age of Queen Elizabeth, the action comes to a climax when a doll
representing the newborn future queen is brought on stage, her reign as
a ‘maiden phoenix’ is predicted, and her chosen successor, King James,
is praised. ‘A pattern to all princes’, she is later described as one
who ‘shall make it Holy-day’: such language suggests how the English
Protestant cult of the Virgin Queen derived some of its power from the
way in which it reworked the Roman Catholic cult of the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>The speech is spoken by the princess’ godfather, Thomas Cranmer,
famous as the architect of the English Reformation and a martyr burnt to
death in the reign of bloody Queen Mary: the linking of the infant
Elizabeth to Protestant ideology could not be more strongly expressed.
Though the final scene was written by Fletcher, Cranmer’s subsequent
image of a ‘cedar’ tree as a representation of the royal genealogical
line replicates a prophecy spoken by the god Jupiter in Shakespeare’s
Cymbeline . Events in Henry the Eighth do not, however, seem to have
been driven by that sense of destiny, of a providential design leading
to the establishment of a new dynasty, which shaped Shakespeare’s
earlier chronicle plays. The emphasis is rather on the vicissitudes of
court life. The play’s structure is built on an apparently arbitrary
pattern of rises and falls: Buckingham falls, Anne Bullen rises, Wolsey
rises, Katherine falls, Wolsey falls, Cranmer rises. Again, as Wolsey
goes down, Thomas Cromwell comes up: Anne Bullen is ‘the weight’ on this
pulley of fortune. There is some skilled compression of history for the
sake of dramatic effect: in the play, the fall of Cardinal Wolsey and
the triple elevation of Thomas More, Thomas Cranmer and Anne Bullen
effectively work as a single event, whereas in reality these three came
to eminence in, respectively, 1529, 1532 and 1533. Wolsey actually died
in 1530, three years before the coronation of Anne as Henry’s second
queen.</p>
<p>Though grounded in history, the pattern of ascent and descent is
analogous to that of romance, with its highs and lows, its voyages and
reunions, things lost and found. The play was originally staged under
the title All is True , a wittily ironic pointer to its fantastical
moments, such as Queen Katherine’s divine vision, which can hardly be
literally true. Shakespeare and Fletcher may have chosen to infuse their
play with the spirit of romance, so far from the tough world of the
Richard and the other Henry plays, in order to create a safety zone that
was necessary because Henry the Eighth dramatizes the still contentious
issue over which England broke from the Church of Rome, the replacement
of Queen Katherine with Anne Bullen. The crux of the action is the fall
of Wolsey, mediator between the king and the Pope. It becomes the
occasion not to pass judgement on the rights and wrongs of the
Reformation, but for a generalized reflection on the fickleness of
fortune and the fruitlessness of hanging ‘on princes’ favours’. Henry
the Eighth was a great favourite on the eighteenth and
nineteenth-century stage. That was partly because of the opportunity for
spectacle provided by the coronation and the play’s other scenes of
procession and court business. But it was also because of the
opportunity given to actors by Wolsey’s great set-piece, ‘Farewell? A
long farewell to all my greatness …’</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s Elizabethan history plays were dominated by wars,
either civil or on French soil, and battles for succession to the crown.
They were written in times of war when the question of the succession to
Elizabeth was deeply troubling to the nation. Henry the Eighth , by
contrast, was written after several years of peace. Indeed, King James
regarded himself as an international peacemaker. Furthermore, he was a
married king, so there was no anxiety about the succession, despite the
nation’s sorrow at the premature death of his eldest son, Prince Henry,
in November 1612. The wedding of the king’s daughter, Princess
Elizabeth, to Frederick the Elector Palatine, the most prominent
Protestant ruler in continental Europe, was postponed until February
1613 so as not to be overshadowed by the funeral. Henry the Eighth , a
play with both a royal death and a royal wedding, was written in the
next few months.</p>
<p>Despite the Protestant match for the princess, there were anxieties
about a possible revival of Roman Catholicism: the religious allegiance
of James’ queen was a matter of public interest about which rumours
circulated. And there was considerable concern over court favourites, as
different factions jostled for power. Ever since the spectacular
entrance procession of King James into London at the beginning of his
reign, the new court had displayed its power through pageantry. The
theatre played a key role here. The king, his family and his courtiers
participated actively in masques, and, in their new capacity as the
King’s Men, Shakespeare and his fellows were frequently called upon to
play at court. All these concerns are woven into the fabric of Henry the
Eighth , making it a distinctively Jacobean drama.</p>
<p>Kingly authority is asserted by pageantry, but also by the ruthless
axing of counsellors who have served their purpose. Buckingham says of
York that ‘no man’s pie is freed / From his ambitious finger’, a
sentiment that could apply to any one of the play’s thrusting courtiers
as they jostle for the top seat at the table of power. A stage direction
in the third act is typical both of the world of the drama and the
environment that Shakespeare would have experienced when he took his men
to play at court: ‘Exit King, frowning upon the Cardinal; the nobles
throng after him, smiling and whispering .’</p>
<p>The question inevitably raised is whether or not the personal
authority of the monarch is absolute. In order to please the courtly
audience it was necessary for Shakespeare and Fletcher to follow a
broadly pro-Henry line, but there do seem to be moments when a critique
of the conscience of the king is built into the action. Specifically, a
series of puns on words such as ‘prick’ and ‘rule’ imply that his policy
is being determined by his sex drive as much as his desire to serve and
shape his nation. The king clearly suffers a failure of ‘temperance’, a
key Protestant virtue, in relation to Anne. And at the most elementary
structural level, there is a tension between the representation of the
two queens and the state ideology of Protestantism. Katherine of Aragon
is the Catholic queen who becomes a near-saint granted a divine vision,
while Anne, the trigger for the Reformation, is given a very small part
and serves primarily as an object of sexual desire. Equally, although
the chancellorship of Sir Thomas More only figures briefly in the play,
there is a clear allusion to his subsequent martyrdom for the Catholic
cause:</p>
<p>But he’s a learnèd man. May he continue</p>
<p>Long in his highness’ favour, and do justice</p>
<p>For truth’s sake and his conscience, that his bones,</p>
<p>When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,</p>
<p>May have a tomb of orphans’ tears wept on him.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s late plays share a fascination with the very different
directions in which poetic language may lead. Elaborate rhetoric and
honeyed words reveal how the verbal arts are tools for preferment and
power. Words are both baits for advancement and means of getting off the
hook: ‘may it like your grace / To let my tongue excuse all.’ On other
occasions, there is a plangent poetry of withdrawal, of retirement from
the courtly fray. How is one to achieve inner peace in this world of
political turmoil? The courtiers have varying degrees of success in
their attempts to learn the Senecan art of patience, of using soliloquy
and self-examination as a means of coming to terms with the buffets of
political fortune. For Queen Katherine, uniquely, there is a moment of
transcendence and divine vision. But it is only a moment, ending with a
dissolution analogous to that of Prospero’s masque in The Tempest :
‘Spirits of peace, where are ye? Are ye all gone? / And leave me here in
wretchedness behind ye?’</p>
<p>The voice that is absent from Henry the Eighth is the one that was so
forceful in Henry IV and Henry V : the commoners, whose plain prose
pricks the bubble of pretentious courtly language. As in The Winter’s
Tale , gentlemen are brought on stage in the role of witnesses. But
there are no equivalents to The Winter’s Tale’s lower-class characters
of Shepherd and Clown. The only prose intervention belongs to a porter
in the final act, who hears the hubbub of young gallants outside the
closed door of the council chambers. ‘These are the youths that thunder
at a playhouse, and fight for bitter apples’, he remarks, perhaps
implying that of the three audiences for whom Shakespeare and Fletcher
were writing - the court, the select company of the indoor Blackfriars
theatre and the mass public who paid a penny to stand in the yard of the
Globe - it is the first two who now interest them more. Insofar as the
play does explore the consciousness of the low born, it is when
commoners such as Cromwell and above all Wolsey - son of a provincial
butcher-become ‘great’ men, provoking the enmity of the dukes and earls
born to ermine. At some level, Shakespeare - son of a provincial glover
who had close links with butcher’s business - is reflecting upon his own
extraordinary rise. Fletcher, by contrast, was born into a higher social
echelon; he and Beaumont did write for the public stage, but always with
a particular eye to the court audience.</p>
<p>There was, perhaps, a particular frisson when the play was performed
at the Blackfriars, since this was the very location of the trial of
Queen Katherine. But there is no doubt that Henry the Eighth was also
played at the Globe soon after it was written. At a performance in June
1613, when ‘chambers’ (small cannon) were discharged in the fourth
scene, the theatre burned down. One of the several surviving accounts of
the fire, by the diplomat Sir Henry Wotton, combines reportage with a
perceptive reading of the play:</p>
<p>Now, to let matters of state sleep, I will entertain you at the
present with what has happened this week at the Bank’s side. The King’s
players had a new play, called All is True , representing some principal
pieces of the reign of Henry VIII, which was set forth with many
extraordinary circumstances of pomp and majesty, even to the matting of
the stage; the Knights of the Order with their Georges and garters, the
Guards with their embroidered coats, and the like: sufficient in truth
within a while to make greatness very familiar, if not ridiculous. Now,
King Henry making a masque at the Cardinal Wolsey’s house, and certain
chambers being shot off at his entry, some of the paper, or other stuff,
wherewith one of them was stopped, did light on the thatch, where being
thought at first but an idle smoke, and their eyes more attentive to the
show, it kindled inwardly, and ran round like a train, consuming within
less than an hour the whole house to the very grounds. This was the
fatal period of that virtuous fabric, wherein yet nothing did perish but
wood and straw, and a few forsaken cloaks; only one man had his breeches
set on fire, that would perhaps have broiled him, if he had not by the
benefit of a provident wit put it out with bottle ale.</p>
<p>Wotton’s account reveals how much care the King’s Men took in their
efforts to represent ‘pomp and majesty’ on stage: from the matting on
the floor to the garters and crosses of Saint George on the costumes,
everything is contrived ‘to make greatness very familiar’. Intriguingly,
though, the effect of transforming royal processions through Whitehall
and Westminster into passages of a play on the matted stage of a
thatched theatre in the margins of Southwark is also to make greatness
seem just a little ridiculous. The representation of the intrinsic
theatricality of state power hints at its flimsiness, its reliance on
the same mechanisms of show as those of the theatre. Wotton’s insight
serves as an epilogue not just on Henry the Eighth but on Shakespeare’s
whole sequence of English history plays: on his stage, the people of
England became intimately familiar for the first time with the story of
their great ones, and at the same time they learnt - through laughter
and through debate - to respect the structures of greatness just a
little less. Having witnessed the fall of lords and even monarchs on the
boards of the Globe, they were ready some forty years later to erect a
scaffold in Whitehall and witness the fall of an axe on the head of a
real king, Charles I.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>AUTHORSHIP: a collaboration between Shakespeare and JOHN FLETCHER.
Neither the First Folio nor any contemporary reference mentions joint
authorship, but many stylistic studies, the first of them published in
1850, have decisively revealed two hands in the composition. Alfred Lord
Tennyson was apparently the first to realize that the co-author was
Fletcher. The different tests of verbal preferences (e.g. you versus ye,
them versus ’em ) and poetic techniques (e.g. pause patterns, feminine
endings, extra monosyllables in pentameter lines) have shown remarkable
unanimity in dividing the scenes in the following clear pattern of
alternation:</p>
<p>1.1, 1.2 Shakespeare</p>
<p>1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2 Fletcher</p>
<p>2.3, 2.4 Shakespeare</p>
<p>3.1 Fletcher</p>
<p>3.2.1-250 Shakespeare</p>
<p>3.2.251-533, 4.1, 4.2 Fletcher</p>
<p>5.1 Shakespeare</p>
<p>5.2, 5.3, 5.4 Fletcher</p>
<p>Prologue and Epilogue: probably Fletcher, but too short for
statistically reliable analysis.</p>
<p>Some scholars have argued that 2.1, 2.2, the second half of 3.2, 4.1
and 4.2 were originally by Shakespeare, but touched up by Fletcher.</p>
<p>TITLE: three contemporary accounts of the early performance when the
Globe caught fire (see ‘Date’, below) refer to the play as All is True ;
another calls it ‘the play of Hen: 8’. This suggests that it was
originally advertised along the lines of ‘All is True: The Famous
History of King Henry the Eighth’, but the Folio editors opted for
simply The Famous History of the Life of King HENRY the Eight.</p>
<p>PLOT: The Duke of Norfolk tells Buckingham of the meeting between
Henry VIII and François I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold.
On the instigation of Cardinal Wolsey, Buckingham is arrested for high
treason. The Queen interrupts the indictment of Buckingham to demand
that the king rescind a tax imposed by Wolsey to finance the French war.
At a party held by Wolsey, Henry meets Anne Bullen and falls in love
with her. Buckingham is tried and executed. The Dukes of Norfolk and
Suffolk fail to turn the king against Wolsey. Henry, questioning the
legality of his marriage to Katherine, sets up a tribunal, presided over
by Wolsey and the papal representative Cardinal Campeius. Anne Bullen is
made Marchioness of Pembroke. Katherine walks out of the tribunal, and
demands that the case be decided in Rome. Wolsey and Campeius fail to
convince the queen to throw herself on the king’s mercy. Anne secretly
marries Henry. A conspiracy by the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk to
disgrace Wolsey is successful, and Wolsey falls. Cranmer is appointed
Archbishop of Canterbury. Katherine is divorced, Anne is crowned queen.
Katherine is told of Wolsey’s death, and she herself dies. Anne gives
birth to a girl, who will grow up to become Queen Elizabeth. Stephen
Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, attempts to indict Cranmer for heresy.
He fails through Henry’s intervention. Elizabeth is christened and
Cranmer predicts the glory of her reign.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Henry VIII (14%/81/9), Cardinal Wolsey (14%/79/7), Queen
Katherine (12%/50/4), Duke of Norfolk (7%/48/5), Duke of Buckingham
(6%/26/2), Lord Chamberlain (5%/38/7), Thomas Cranmer (4%/21/4), Duke of
Suffolk (3%/30/4), Gardiner (3%/22/3), Earl of Surrey (3%/24/2), Sir
Thomas Lovell (2%/21/4), Old Lady (2%/14/2), Surveyor (2%/9/1), Griffith
(2%/13/2), Anne Bullen (2%/18/2), Cardinal Campeius (2%/14/3), Thomas
Cromwell (2%/21/2), Lord Sands (2%/17/2).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 98% verse, 2% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: 1613. The first Globe theatre burned down in a fire that
started during a performance of the play on 29 June 1613. A letter by
Sir Henry Wotton describes it as ‘a new play’ at this time.</p>
<p>SOURCES: principally based on the third volume of Holinshed’s
Chronicles, probably in the 1587 edition; the Stephen Gardiner sequence
in Act 5 draws on John Foxe’s virulently anti-Catholic Actes and
Monuments (perhaps in 1583 edition); John Stow’s Annals (1592) and John
Speed’s Theatre of the Empire of Great Britain (1611) also seem to have
been consulted and there may be some influence from an earlier play in
celebration of the birth of one of Henry VIII’s children, Samuel
Rowley’s When you see me, You know me. Or the famous Chronicle Historie
of king Henrie the eighth, with the birth and vertuous life of Edward
Prince of Wales (1605).</p>
<p>TEXT: First Folio is only early text. Good quality of printing,
probably set from a scribal transcript of the authorial manuscript.</p>

<p>To rank our chosen truth with such a show</p>
<p>As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</p>
<p>Our own brains 17 intend, and the opinion that we bring</p>
<p>To make that only true we now intend 18 ,</p>
<p>Will leave us never an understanding 19 friend.</p>
<p>Therefore, for goodness’ sake, and as you are known</p>
<p>The first and happiest 20 hearers of the town,</p>
<p>Be sad 21 , as we would make ye. Think ye see</p>
<p>The very persons of our noble story</p>
<p>As 22 they were living: think you see them great 23 ,</p>
<p>And followed with the general throng and sweat</p>
<p>Of thousand friends: then, in a moment, see</p>
<p>How soon this mightiness meets misery:</p>
<p>And if you can be merry then, I’ll say</p>
<p>A man may weep upon his wedding day.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>Act 1</p>
