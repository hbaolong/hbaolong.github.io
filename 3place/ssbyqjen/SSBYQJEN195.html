<h4 id="scene-3-running-scene-2-continues">Scene 3 ／ running scene 2
continues</h4>
<p>Enter Celia and Rosalind</p>
<p>CELIA Why, cousin? Why, Rosalind? Cupid 207 have mercy, not a
word?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Not one to throw at a dog.</p>
<p>CELIA No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs 208 ,
throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons 209 .</p>
<p>ROSALIND Then there were 210 two cousins laid up, when the one should
be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any.</p>
<p>CELIA But is all this for your father?</p>
<p>ROSALIND No, some of it is for my child’s father 211 . O, how full of
briars 212 is this working-day 213 world!</p>
<p>CELIA They are but burs 214 , cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday
foolery: if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats 215
will catch them.</p>
<p>ROSALIND I could shake them off my coat 216 : these burs are in my
heart.</p>
<p>CELIA Hem 217 them away.</p>
<p>ROSALIND I would try, if I could cry ‘hem’ 218 and have 219 him.</p>
<p>CELIA Come, come, wrestle 220 with thy affections.</p>
<p>ROSALIND O, they take the part of 221 a better wrestler than
myself!</p>
<p>CELIA O, a good wish upon you 222 ! You will try 223 in time, in
despite of a fall 224 . But turning these jests out of service 225 , let
us talk in good earnest: is it possible, on such a sudden, you should
fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland’s youngest son?</p>
<p>ROSALIND The duke my father loved his father dearly 226 .</p>
<p>CELIA Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly? By
this kind of chase 227 , I should hate him, for my father hated his
father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.</p>
<p>ROSALIND No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.</p>
<p>CELIA Why should I not? 228 Doth he not deserve well?</p>
<p>Enter Duke with Lords</p>
<p>ROSALIND Let me love him for that, and do you love him because I do.
Look, here comes the duke.</p>
<p>CELIA With his eyes full of anger.</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste 229</p>
<p>To Rosalind</p>
<p>And get you from our court.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Me, uncle?</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK You, cousin</p>
<p>Within these ten days if that thou be’st found</p>
<p>So near our public court as twenty miles,</p>
<p>Thou diest for it.</p>
<p>ROSALIND I do beseech your grace,</p>
<p>Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:</p>
<p>If with myself I hold intelligence 230</p>
<p>Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,</p>
<p>If that I do not dream or be not frantic 231 —</p>
<p>As I do trust I am not — then, dear 232 uncle,</p>
<p>Never so much as in a thought unborn</p>
<p>Did I offend your highness.</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK Thus do all traitors.</p>
<p>If their purgation 233 did consist in words,</p>
<p>They are as innocent as grace 234 itself;</p>
<p>Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor;</p>
<p>Tell me whereon 235 the likelihood depends.</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK Thou art thy father’s daughter, there’s enough.</p>
<p>ROSALIND So was I when your highness took his dukedom,</p>
<p>So was I when your highness banished him;</p>
<p>Treason is not inherited, my lord,</p>
<p>Or if we did derive it from our friends 236 ,</p>
<p>What’s that to me? My father was no traitor.</p>
<p>Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much</p>
<p>To think my poverty is treacherous.</p>
<p>CELIA Dear sovereign, hear me speak.</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK Ay, Celia, we stayed 237 her for your sake,</p>
<p>Else 238 had she with her father ranged 239 along.</p>
<p>CELIA I did not then entreat to have her stay,</p>
<p>It was your pleasure 240 and your own remorse 241 .</p>
<p>I was too young 242 that time to value her,</p>
<p>But now I know her: if she be a traitor,</p>
<p>Why so am I. We still 243 have slept together,</p>
<p>Rose at an instant 244 , learned, played, eat 245 together,</p>
<p>And wheresoe’er we went, like Juno’s swans 246 ,</p>
<p>Still we went coupled and inseparable.</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK She is too subtle 247 for thee, and her smoothness 248
,</p>
<p>Her very silence and her patience</p>
<p>Speak to the people, and they pity her.</p>
<p>Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name 249 ,</p>
<p>And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous</p>
<p>When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.</p>
<p>Firm and irrevocable is my doom 250</p>
<p>Which I have passed upon her: she is banished.</p>
<p>CELIA Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:</p>
<p>I cannot live out of her company.</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK You are a fool. You, niece, provide 251 yourself:</p>
<p>If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,</p>
<p>And in the greatness 252 of my word, you die.</p>
<p>Exeunt Duke and others</p>
<p>CELIA O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?</p>
<p>Wilt thou change 253 fathers? I will give thee mine.</p>
<p>I charge thee be not thou more grieved than I am.</p>
<p>ROSALIND I have more cause.</p>
<p>CELIA Thou hast not, cousin.</p>
<p>Prithee be cheerful; know’st thou not the duke</p>
<p>Hath banished me, his daughter?</p>
<p>ROSALIND That he hath not.</p>
<p>CELIA No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love</p>
<p>Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.</p>
<p>Shall we be sundered 254 ? Shall we part, sweet girl?</p>
<p>No, let my father seek another heir:</p>
<p>Therefore devise with me how we may fly,</p>
<p>Whither to go and what to bear with us.</p>
<p>And do not seek to take your change 255 upon you,</p>
<p>To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out,</p>
<p>For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale 256 ,</p>
<p>Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Why, whither shall we go?</p>
<p>CELIA To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Alas, what danger will it be to us,</p>
<p>Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!</p>
<p>Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.</p>
<p>CELIA I’ll put myself in poor and mean 257 attire</p>
<p>And with a kind of umber 258 smirch my face.</p>
<p>The like do you. So shall we pass along</p>
<p>And never stir assailants.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Were it not better,</p>
<p>Because that I am more than common tall,</p>
<p>That I did suit me all points 259 like a man?</p>
<p>A gallant curtle-axe 260 upon my thigh,</p>
<p>A boar-spear 261 in my hand, and — in my heart</p>
<p>Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will —</p>
<p>We’ll have a swashing 262 and a martial outside,</p>
<p>As many other mannish cowards have</p>
<p>That do outface it with their semblances 263 .</p>
<p>CELIA What shall I call thee when thou art a man?</p>
<p>ROSALIND I’ll have no worse a name than Jove 264 ’s own page,</p>
<p>And therefore look you call me Ganymede 265 .</p>
<p>But what will you be called?</p>
<p>CELIA Something that hath a reference to my state 266 :</p>
<p>No longer Celia, but Aliena 267 .</p>
<p>ROSALIND But, cousin, what if we assayed 268 to steal</p>
<p>The clownish fool out of your father’s court?</p>
<p>Would he not be a comfort to our travel 269 ?</p>
<p>CELIA He’ll go along o’er the wide world with me.</p>
<p>Leave me alone 270 to woo 271 him. Let’s away,</p>
<p>And get our jewels and our wealth together,</p>
<p>Devise the fittest time and safest way</p>
<p>To hide us from pursuit that will be made</p>
<p>After my flight. Now go in we content 272</p>
<p>To liberty and not to banishment.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
