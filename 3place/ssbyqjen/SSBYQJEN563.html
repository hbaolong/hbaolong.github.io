11</h4>
<p>Enter Othello and Desdemona in her bed</p>
<p>Othello with a light</p>
<p>OTHELLO It is the cause 1595 , it is the cause, my soul:</p>
<p>Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars:</p>
<p>It is the cause. Yet I’ll not shed her blood,</p>
<p>Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,</p>
<p>And smooth as monumental alabaster 1596 :</p>
<p>Yet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.</p>
<p>Put out the light 1597 , and then put out the light.</p>
<p>If I quench thee, thou flaming minister 1598 1599 ,</p>
<p>I can again thy former light restore,</p>
<p>Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,</p>
<p>Thou cunning’st pattern 1600 of excelling nature,</p>
<p>I know not where is that Promethean 1601 heat</p>
<p>That can thy light relume 1602 . When I have plucked thy rose,</p>
<p>I cannot give it vital 1603 growth again:</p>
<p>It needs must wither. I’ll smell thee on the tree.</p>
<p>Kisses her</p>
<p>O balmy breath, that dost almost persuade</p>
<p>Justice 1604 to break her sword! One more, one more.</p>
<p>Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee</p>
<p>And love thee after. One more, and that’s the last.</p>
<p>Kisses her</p>
<p>So sweet was ne’er so fatal 1605 . I must weep,</p>
<p>But they are cruel tears: this sorrow’s heavenly,</p>
<p>It strikes 1606 where it doth love. She wakes.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Who’s there? Othello?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ay 1607 , Desdemona.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Will you come to bed, my lord?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Have you prayed tonight, Desdemon?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Ay, my lord.</p>
<p>OTHELLO If you bethink yourself of any crime</p>
<p>Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,</p>
<p>Solicit 1608 for it straight.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Alack, my lord, what may you mean by that?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Well, do it, and be brief: I will walk by.</p>
<p>I would not kill thy unpreparèd spirit,</p>
<p>No, heavens forfend 1609 ! I would not kill thy soul.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Talk you of killing?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ay, I do.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Then heaven have mercy on me!</p>
<p>OTHELLO Amen, with all my heart!</p>
<p>DESDEMONA If you say 1610 , I hope you will not kill me.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Hum!</p>
<p>DESDEMONA And yet I fear you, for you’re fatal then</p>
<p>When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,</p>
<p>Since guiltiness I know not, but yet I feel I fear.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Think on thy sins.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA They are loves I bear to you 1611 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ay, and for that thou diest.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA That death’s unnatural that kills for loving.</p>
<p>Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?</p>
<p>Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:</p>
<p>These are portents, but yet I hope, I hope,</p>
<p>They do not point on me.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Peace, and be still!</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I will so. What’s the matter?</p>
<p>OTHELLO That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee</p>
<p>Thou gav’st to Cassio.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA No, by my life and soul!</p>
<p>Send for the man and ask him.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Sweet soul, take heed, take heed of perjury:</p>
<p>Thou art on thy death-bed.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Ay, but not yet to die.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Presently 1612 :</p>
<p>Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin,</p>
<p>For to deny each article 1613 with oath</p>
<p>Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception 1614</p>
<p>That I do groan witha 1615 l. Thou art to die.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA O, heaven have mercy on me!</p>
<p>OTHELLO I say, amen.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA And have you mercy too! I never did</p>
<p>Offend 1616 you in my life, never loved Cassio</p>
<p>But with such general warranty 1617 of heaven</p>
<p>As I might love: I never gave him token.</p>
<p>OTHELLO By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in’s hand.</p>
<p>O perjured woman, thou dost stone 1618 my heart,</p>
<p>And makes me call what I intend to do</p>
<p>A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:</p>
<p>I saw the handkerchief.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA He found it then:</p>
<p>I never gave it him. Send for him hither,</p>
<p>Let him confess a truth.</p>
<p>OTHELLO He hath confessed.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA What, my lord?</p>
<p>OTHELLO That he hath used 1619 thee.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA How? Unlawfully?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ay.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA He will not say so.</p>
<p>OTHELLO No, his mouth is stopped:</p>
<p>Honest Iago hath ta’en order 1620 for’t.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA O, my fear interprets! What, is he dead?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge</p>
<p>Had stomach 1621 for them all.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Alas, he is betrayed and I undone!</p>
<p>OTHELLO Out, strumpet! Weep’st thou for him to my face?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!</p>
<p>OTHELLO Down, strumpet!</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Kill me tomorrow, let me live tonight!</p>
<p>OTHELLO Nay, if you strive 1622 —</p>
<p>DESDEMONA But half an hour!</p>
<p>OTHELLO Being done 1623 , there is no pause 1624 .</p>
<p>DESDEMONA But while I say one prayer!</p>
<p>OTHELLO It is too late.</p>
<p>Smothers her</p>
<p>Emilia at the door</p>
<p>EMILIA My lord, my lord! What, ho! My lord, my lord!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>OTHELLO What noise is this? Not dead? Not yet quite dead?</p>
<p>I that am cruel am yet merciful:</p>
<p>I would not have thee linger in thy pain: so, so.</p>
<p>EMILIA What, ho? My lord, my lord!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>OTHELLO Who’s there?</p>
<p>EMILIA O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>OTHELLO Yes.— ’Tis Emilia.— By and by 1625 .— She’s dead.</p>
<p>’Tis like 1626 she comes to speak of Cassio’s death.—</p>
<p>The noise 1627 was high 1628 . Ha, no more moving?</p>
<p>Still as the grave. Shall she come in? Were’t good?—</p>
<p>I think she stirs again. No. What’s best to do?</p>
<p>If she come in, she’ll sure speak to my wife:</p>
<p>My wife, my wife! What wife? I have no wife.</p>
<p>O insupportable! O heavy hour!</p>
<p>Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse</p>
<p>Of sun and moon, and that th’affrighted globe</p>
<p>Did yawn at alteration 1629 .</p>
<p>EMILIA I do beseech you</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!</p>
<p>OTHELLO I had forgot thee.— O, come in, Emilia.—</p>
<p>Soft 1630 , by and by: let me the curtains 1631 draw.—</p>
<p>Draws the bed-curtains and unlocks the door</p>
<p>Where art thou? What’s the matter with thee now?</p>
<p>Enter Emilia</p>
<p>EMILIA O, my good lord, yonder’s foul murders done!</p>
<p>OTHELLO What? Now?</p>
<p>EMILIA But now, my lord.</p>
<p>OTHELLO It is the very error 1632 of the moon:</p>
<p>She comes more nearer earth than she was wont 1633 ,</p>
<p>And makes men mad.</p>
<p>EMILIA Cassio, my lord, hath killed a young Venetian</p>
<p>Called Rodorigo.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Rodorigo killed? And Cassio killed?</p>
<p>EMILIA No, Cassio is not killed.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Not Cassio killed? Then murder’s out of tune,</p>
<p>And sweet revenge grows harsh 1634 .</p>
<p>DESDEMONA O, falsely 1635 , falsely murdered!</p>
<p>EMILIA Alas! What cry is that?</p>
<p>OTHELLO That? What?</p>
<p>EMILIA Out, and alas! 1636 That was my lady’s voice.</p>
<p>Help, help, ho, help! O lady, speak again!</p>
<p>Opens the bed-curtains</p>
<p>Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!</p>
<p>DESDEMONA A guiltless death I die.</p>
<p>EMILIA O, who hath done this deed?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Nobody: I myself. Farewell.</p>
<p>Commend me to my kind lord. O, farewell!</p>
<p>Dies</p>
<p>OTHELLO Why, how should she be murdered?</p>
<p>EMILIA Alas, who knows?</p>
<p>OTHELLO You hear her say herself it was not I.</p>
<p>EMILIA She said so: I must needs report the truth.</p>
<p>OTHELLO She’s like a liar gone to burning hell:</p>
<p>’Twas I that killed her.</p>
<p>EMILIA O, the more angel she, and you the blacker devil!</p>
<p>OTHELLO She turned to folly 1637 , and she was a whore.</p>
<p>EMILIA Thou dost belie 1638 her, and thou art a devil.</p>
<p>OTHELLO She was false as water.</p>
<p>EMILIA Thou art rash as fire, to say</p>
<p>That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!</p>
<p>OTHELLO Cassio did top 1639 her: ask thy husband else 1640 .</p>
<p>O, I were damned beneath all depth in hell,</p>
<p>But 1641 that I did proceed upon just grounds</p>
<p>To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.</p>
<p>EMILIA My husband?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Thy husband.</p>
<p>EMILIA That she was false to wedlock?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ay, with Cassio. Had she been true,</p>
<p>If heaven would make me such another world</p>
<p>Of one entire and perfect chrysolite 1642 ,</p>
<p>I’d not have sold her for it.</p>
<p>EMILIA My husband?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ay, ’twas he that told me on 1643 her first:</p>
<p>An honest man he is, and hates the slime 1644</p>
<p>That sticks on filthy deeds 1645 .</p>
<p>EMILIA My husband?</p>
<p>OTHELLO What needs this iterance 1646 , woman? I say thy husband.</p>
<p>EMILIA O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with 1647 love.</p>
<p>My husband say she was false?</p>
<p>OTHELLO He, woman;</p>
<p>I say thy husband: dost understand the word?</p>
<p>My friend, thy husband: honest, honest Iago.</p>
<p>EMILIA If he say so, may his pernicious 1648 soul</p>
<p>Rot half a grain a day! He lies to th’heart:</p>
<p>She was too fond of her most filthy 1649 bargain 1650 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ha?</p>
<p>EMILIA Do thy worst:</p>
<p>This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven</p>
<p>Than thou wast worthy her.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Peace, you were best 1651 —</p>
<p>EMILIA Thou hast not half that power to do me harm</p>
<p>As I have to be hurt 1652 . O gull 1653 , O dolt,</p>
<p>As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed —</p>
<p>I care not for thy sword — I’ll make thee known 1654 ,</p>
<p>Though I lost twenty lives.— Help, help, ho, help!</p>
<p>The Moor hath killed my mistress! Murder, murder!</p>
<p>Enter Montano, Gratiano and Iago</p>
<p>MONTANO What is the matter? How now, general?</p>
<p>EMILIA O, are you come, Iago? You have done well,</p>
<p>That men must lay their murders on your neck.</p>
<p>GRATIANO What is the matter?</p>
<p>EMILIA Disprove this villain, if thou be’st a man:</p>
<p>To lago</p>
<p>He says thou told’st him that his wife was false:</p>
<p>I know thou didst not, thou’rt not such a villain.</p>
<p>Speak, for my heart is full.</p>
<p>IAGO I told him what I thought, and told no more</p>
<p>Than what he found himself was apt 1655 and true.</p>
<p>EMILIA But did you ever tell him she was false?</p>
<p>IAGO I did.</p>
<p>EMILIA You told a lie, an odious, damnèd lie:</p>
<p>Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.</p>
<p>She false with Cassio? Did you say with Cassio?</p>
<p>IAGO With Cassio, mistress! Go to, charm 1656 your tongue.</p>
<p>EMILIA I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:</p>
<p>My mistress here lies murdered in her bed—</p>
<p>ALL O, heavens forfend!</p>
<p>EMILIA And your reports have set the murder on.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Nay, stare not, masters: it is true indeed.</p>
<p>GRATIANO ’Tis a strange truth.</p>
<p>MONTANO O, monstrous act!</p>
<p>EMILIA Villainy, villainy, villainy!</p>
<p>I think upon’t, I think: I smell’t: O villainy!</p>
<p>I thought so then. I’ll kill myself for grief.</p>
<p>O villainy! Villainy!</p>
<p>IAGO What, are you mad? I charge you get you home.</p>
<p>EMILIA Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:</p>
<p>’Tis proper I obey him, but not now.</p>
<p>Perchance, Iago, I will ne’er go home.</p>
<p>OTHELLO O, O, O!</p>
<p>He falls on the bed</p>
<p>EMILIA Nay, lay thee down and roar,</p>
<p>For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent</p>
<p>That e’er did lift up eye 1657 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO O, she was foul 1658 !</p>
<p>Rises</p>
<p>I scarce did know you, uncle 1659 : there lies your niece,</p>
<p>Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopped:</p>
<p>I know this act shows horrible and grim 1660 .</p>
<p>GRATIANO Poor Desdemon! I am glad thy father’s dead:</p>
<p>Thy match was mortal 1661 to him, and pure grief</p>
<p>Shore his old thread 1662 in twain. Did he live now,</p>
<p>This sight would make him do a desperate turn 1663 1664 ,</p>
<p>Yea, curse his better angel from his side,</p>
<p>And fall to reprobance 1665 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO ’Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows</p>
<p>That she with Cassio hath the act of shame</p>
<p>A thousand times committed: Cassio confessed it,</p>
<p>And she did gratify his amorous works 1666</p>
<p>With that recognizance 1667 and pledge of love</p>
<p>Which I first gave her: I saw it in his hand:</p>
<p>It was a handkerchief, an antique 1668 token</p>
<p>My father gave my mother.</p>
<p>EMILIA O heaven! O heavenly powers!</p>
<p>IAGO Come, hold your peace 1669 .</p>
<p>EMILIA ’Twill out, ’twill out. I peace?</p>
<p>No, I will speak as liberal as the north 1670 :</p>
<p>Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,</p>
<p>All, all, cry shame against me, yet I’ll speak.</p>
<p>IAGO Be wise, and get you home.</p>
<p>EMILIA I will not.</p>
<p>lago threatens to stab Emilia</p>
<p>GRATIANO Fie, your sword upon a woman?</p>
<p>EMILIA O thou dull 1671 Moor! That handkerchief thou speak’st of</p>
<p>I found by fortune and did give my husband,</p>
<p>For often, with a solemn earnestness —</p>
<p>More than indeed belonged 1672 to such a trifle —</p>
<p>He begged of me to steal’t.</p>
<p>IAGO Villainous whore!</p>
<p>EMILIA She give it Cassio? No, alas! I found it,</p>
<p>And I did give’t my husband.</p>
<p>IAGO Filth 1673 , thou liest!</p>
<p>EMILIA By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.</p>
<p>O murd’rous coxcomb 1674 ! What should such a fool</p>
<p>Do with so good a wife?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Are there no stones 1675 in heaven</p>
<p>But what serves for the thunder?— Precious 1676 villain!</p>
<p>He runs at lago but is disarmed; lago stabs Emilia</p>
<p>GRATIANO The woman falls: sure, he hath killed his wife.</p>
<p>[Exit Iago ]</p>
<p>EMILIA Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistress’ side.</p>
<p>GRATIANO He’s gone, but his wife’s killed.</p>
<p>MONTANO ’Tis a notorious 1677 villain. Take you this weapon</p>
<p>Which I have recovered 1678 from the Moor:</p>
<p>Come, guard the door without 1679 : let him not pass,</p>
<p>But kill him rather. I’ll after that same villain,</p>
<p>For’tis a damnèd slave.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Montano and Gratiano ]</p>
<p>OTHELLO I am not valiant neither,</p>
<p>But every puny whipster 1680 gets my sword:</p>
<p>But why should honour 1681 outlive honesty 1682 ?</p>
<p>Let it go all.</p>
<p>EMILIA What did thy song bode, lady?</p>
<p>Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan,</p>
<p>And die in music 1683 :—</p>
<p>Willow, willow, willow—</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Moor, she was chaste: she loved thee, cruel Moor.</p>
<p>So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true,</p>
<p>So speaking as I think, alas, I die.</p>
<p>Dies</p>
<p>OTHELLO I have another weapon in this chamber:</p>
<p>It was a sword of Spain, the ice-brook’s temper 1684 :</p>
<p>O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.</p>
<p>Finds sword</p>
<p>GRATIANO If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>Thou hast no weapon, and perforce 1685 must suffer.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Look in upon me then and speak with me,</p>
<p>Or, naked 1686 as I am, I will assault thee.</p>
<p>[Enter Gratiano ]</p>
<p>GRATIANO What is the matter?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Behold, I have a weapon:</p>
<p>A better never did itself sustain 1687 1688</p>
<p>Upon a soldier’s thigh. I have seen the day</p>
<p>That, with this little arm and this good sword,</p>
<p>I have made my way through more impediments</p>
<p>Than twenty times your stop 1689 : but — O vain boast! —</p>
<p>Who can control his fate? ’Tis not so now.</p>
<p>Be not afraid, though you do see me weaponed:</p>
<p>Here 1690 is my journey’s end, here is my butt 1691</p>
<p>And very sea-mark 1692 of my utmost sail.</p>
<p>Do you go back dismayed? ’Tis a lost 1693 fear:</p>
<p>Man but a rush 1694 against Othello’s breast</p>
<p>And he retires. Where should Othello go?</p>
<p>Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starred 1695 wench,</p>
<p>Pale as thy smock 1696 , when we shall meet at compt 1697 ,</p>
<p>This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,</p>
<p>And fiends will snatch at it! Cold, cold, my girl?</p>
<p>Even like thy chastity. O cursèd, cursèd slave 1698 !</p>
<p>Whip me, ye devils,</p>
<p>From the possession of this heavenly sight,</p>
<p>Blow me about in winds, roast me in sulphur,</p>
<p>Wash me in steep-down 1699 gulfs of liquid fire!</p>
<p>O Desdemon! Dead, Desdemon! Dead! O, O!</p>
<p>Enter Lodovico, Cassio [carried in a chair ], Montano and Iago
[prisoner ] with Officers</p>
<p>LODOVICO Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?</p>
<p>OTHELLO That’s he that was Othello: here I am.</p>
<p>LODOVICO Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I look down towards his feet 1700 , but that’s a fable:</p>
<p>If that thou be’st a devil, I cannot kill thee.</p>
<p>Wounds lago</p>
<p>LODOVICO Wrench his sword from him.</p>
<p>IAGO I bleed, sir, but not killed.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I am not sorry neither: I’d have thee live,</p>
<p>For in my sense 1701 ’tis happiness to die.</p>
<p>LODOVICO O thou Othello, thou was once so good,</p>
<p>Fall’n in the practice 1702 of a cursèd slave,</p>
<p>What shall be said to thee?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Why, anything:</p>
<p>An honourable murderer, if you will,</p>
<p>For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.</p>
<p>LODOVICO This wretch hath part confessed his villainy.</p>
<p>Did you and he consent in Cassio’s death?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ay.</p>
<p>CASSIO Dear general, I never gave you cause.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.</p>
<p>Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil</p>
<p>Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?</p>
<p>IAGO Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:</p>
<p>From this time forth I never will speak word.</p>
<p>LODOVICO What? Not to pray?</p>
<p>GRATIANO Torments 1703 will ope your lips.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Well, thou dost best.</p>
<p>LODOVICO Sir, you shall understand what hath befall’n —</p>
<p>Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter</p>
<p>Found in the pocket of the slain Rodorigo,</p>
<p>And here another: the one of them imports 1704</p>
<p>The death of Cassio to be undertook</p>
<p>By Rodorigo.</p>
<p>OTHELLO O villain!</p>
<p>CASSIO Most heathenish and most gross 1705 !</p>
<p>LODOVICO Now here’s another discontented 1706 paper</p>
<p>Found in his pocket too: and this, it seems,</p>
<p>Rodorigo meant t’have sent this damnèd villain,</p>
<p>But that belike 1707 Iago in the interim</p>
<p>Came in and satisfied him 1708 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO O thou pernicious caitiff 1709 !—</p>
<p>How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief</p>
<p>That was my wife’s?</p>
<p>CASSIO I found it in my chamber,</p>
<p>And he himself confessed it but even now</p>
<p>That there he dropped it for a special purpose</p>
<p>Which wrought to his desire 1710 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO O fool, fool, fool!</p>
<p>CASSIO There is besides in Rodorigo’s letter</p>
<p>How he upbraids Iago, that he made him</p>
<p>Brave 1711 me upon the watch, whereon 1712 it came</p>
<p>That I was cast 1713 : and even but now he spake —</p>
<p>After long seeming dead — Iago hurt him,</p>
<p>Iago set him on.</p>
<p>LODOVICO You must forsake this room and go with us:</p>
<p>To Othello</p>
<p>Your power and your command is taken off,</p>
<p>And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,</p>
<p>If there be any cunning cruelty</p>
<p>That can torment him much and hold him long 1714 ,</p>
<p>It shall be his. You shall close 1715 prisoner rest</p>
<p>Till that the nature of your fault be known</p>
<p>To the Venetian state.— Come, bring away.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Soft you; a word or two before you go.</p>
<p>I have done the state some service, and they know’t —</p>
<p>No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,</p>
<p>When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,</p>
<p>Speak of me as I am: nothing extenuate 1716 ,</p>
<p>Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak</p>
<p>Of one that loved not wisely but too well:</p>
<p>Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought 1717 ,</p>
<p>Perplexed 1718 in the extreme: of one whose hand,</p>
<p>Like the base 1719 Judean 1720 , threw a pearl away</p>
<p>Richer than all his tribe: of one whose subdued 1721 eyes,</p>
<p>Albeit unusèd to the melting mood,</p>
<p>Drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees 1722</p>
<p>Their medicinable 1723 gum. Set you down this,</p>
<p>And say besides, that in Aleppo 1724 once,</p>
<p>Where a malignant and a turbaned Turk</p>
<p>Beat a Venetian and traduced 1725 the state,</p>
<p>I took by th’throat the circumcisèd dog</p>
<p>And smote him, thus.</p>
<p>Stabs himself</p>
<p>LODOVICO O bloody period 1726 !</p>
<p>GRATIANO All that is spoke is marred.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I kissed thee ere I killed thee 1727 : no way but this,</p>
<p>Killing myself, to die 1728 upon a kiss.</p>
<p>Kisses Desdemona</p>
<p>Dies</p>
<p>CASSIO This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon,</p>
<p>For he was great of heart.</p>
<p>LODOVICO O Spartan dog 1729 ,</p>
<p>To lago</p>
<p>More fell 1730 than anguish, hunger, or the sea!</p>
<p>Look on the tragic loading of this bed:</p>
<p>This is thy work.— The object poisons sight,</p>
<p>Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep 1731 the house,</p>
<p>And seize upon 1732 the fortunes of the Moor,</p>
<p>For they succeed on 1733 you.— To you, lord governor,</p>
<p>To Cassio</p>
<p>Remains the censure 1734 of this hellish villain:</p>
<p>The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!</p>
<p>Myself will straight aboard, and to the state</p>
<p>This heavy 1735 act with heavy heart relate.</p>

was bound to be cuckolded; perhaps Shakespeare originally intended
Cassio to be married, or else the line refers to an imminent or a
narrowly avoided wedding (Bianca later claims that Cassio is going to
marry her); but editors have struggled to make sense of the line, and a
printer’s error is possible; the most satisfactory emendation would be
limned (depicted, portrayed), which fits with Iago’s emphasis on
Cassio’s effeminacy, as he compares him first to a wife and then to a

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain) . Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster, and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus’PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final’-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside ?(often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading’bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
