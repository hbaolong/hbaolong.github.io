<h4 id="scene-2-388-running-scene-5">Scene 2 388 / running scene 5</h4>
<p>Flourish. Enter the King, the Queen, Clifford, Northum [berland ] and
young Prince, with Drum and Trumpets 389</p>
<p>York’s head is set above the city gates</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Welcome, my lord, to this brave 390 town of York.</p>
<p>Yonder’s the head of that arch-enemy</p>
<p>That sought to be encompassed with your crown:</p>
<p>Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck 391
:</p>
<p>To see this sight, it irks 392 my very soul.</p>
<p>Withhold revenge, dear God! ’tis not my fault,</p>
<p>Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD My gracious liege, this too much lenity 393</p>
<p>And harmful pity must be laid aside.</p>
<p>To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?</p>
<p>Not to the beast that would usurp their den.</p>
<p>Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?</p>
<p>Not his that spoils 394 her young before her face.</p>
<p>Who scapes the lurking serpent’s mortal sting?</p>
<p>Not he that sets his foot upon her back.</p>
<p>The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,</p>
<p>And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.</p>
<p>Ambitious York doth level 395 at thy crown,</p>
<p>Thou smiling while he knit 396 his angry brows:</p>
<p>He, but a duke, would have his son a king,</p>
<p>And raise 397 his issue 398 , like a loving sire 399 ;</p>
<p>Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly 400 son,</p>
<p>Didst yield consent to disinherit him,</p>
<p>Which argued thee 401 a most unloving father.</p>
<p>Unreasonable 402 creatures feed their young;</p>
<p>And though man’s face be fearful 403 to their eyes,</p>
<p>Yet, in protection of their tender 404 ones,</p>
<p>Who hath not seen them, even with those wings</p>
<p>Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,</p>
<p>Make war with him that climbed unto their nest,</p>
<p>Offering their own lives in their young’s defence?</p>
<p>For shame, my liege, make them your precedent 405 !</p>
<p>Were it not pity 406 that this goodly boy</p>
<p>Should lose his birthright by his father’s fault,</p>
<p>And long hereafter say unto his child,</p>
<p>’What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got</p>
<p>My careless father fondly 407 gave away’?</p>
<p>Ah, what a shame 408 were this! Look on the boy;</p>
<p>And let his manly face, which promiseth</p>
<p>Successful fortune, steel thy melting 409 heart</p>
<p>To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Full well hath Clifford played the orator,</p>
<p>Inferring 410 arguments of mighty force:</p>
<p>But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear</p>
<p>That things ill-got 411 had ever bad success 412 ?</p>
<p>And happy 413 always was it for that son</p>
<p>Whose father for his hoarding 414 went to hell?</p>
<p>I’ll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind,</p>
<p>And would my father had left me no more:</p>
<p>For all the rest is held at such a rate 415</p>
<p>As brings a thousand-fold more care 416 to keep 417</p>
<p>Than in possession any jot of pleasure.</p>
<p>Ah, cousin York, would thy best friends did know</p>
<p>How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh 418
,</p>
<p>And this soft courage makes your followers faint 419 .</p>
<p>You promised knighthood to our forward 420 son:</p>
<p>Unsheathe your sword, and dub 421 him presently 422 .</p>
<p>Edward, kneel down.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;</p>
<p>And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right 423 .</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD My gracious father, by your kingly leave,</p>
<p>I’ll draw it as apparent 424 to the crown,</p>
<p>And in that quarrel use it to the death.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Why, that is spoken like a toward 425 prince.</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER Royal commanders, be in readiness:</p>
<p>For with a band of thirty thousand men</p>
<p>Comes Warwick, backing of 426 the Duke of York;</p>
<p>And in the towns, as they do march along,</p>
<p>Proclaims him king, and many fly to him.</p>
<p>Deraign 427 your battle 428 , for they are at hand.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>CLIFFORD I would your highness would depart the field:</p>
<p>The queen hath best success when you are absent.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Why, that’s my fortune too: therefore I’ll stay.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Be it with resolution then to fight.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD My royal father, cheer these noble lords</p>
<p>And hearten those that fight in your defence.</p>
<p>Unsheathe your sword, good father, cry ‘Saint George!’</p>
<p>March. Enter Edward, Warwick, Richard, Clarence [George ] 429 ,
Norfolk, Montague and Soldiers</p>
<p>EDWARD Now, perjured Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace,</p>
<p>And set thy diadem upon my head,</p>
<p>Or bide 430 the mortal 431 fortune of the field?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Go, rate 432 thy minions 433 , proud insulting
boy.</p>
<p>Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms</p>
<p>Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?</p>
<p>EDWARD I am his king, and he should bow his knee:</p>
<p>I was adopted heir by his consent.</p>
<p>Since when, his oath is broke, for as I hear,</p>
<p>You that are king, though he do wear the crown,</p>
<p>Have caused him, by new act of parliament,</p>
<p>To blot out me and put his own son in.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD And reason too:</p>
<p>Who should succeed the father but the son?</p>
<p>RICHARD Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Ay, crookback, here I stand to answer thee,</p>
<p>Or any he 434 , the proudest of thy sort 435 .</p>
<p>RICHARD ’Twas you that killed young Rutland, was it not?</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.</p>
<p>RICHARD For God’s sake, lords, give signal to the fight.</p>
<p>WARWICK What say’st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Why, how now, long-tongued 436 Warwick, dare you
speak?</p>
<p>When you and I met at St Albans last,</p>
<p>Your legs did better service than your hands 437 .</p>
<p>WARWICK Then ’twas my turn to fly, and now ’tis thine.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD You said so much before and yet you fled.</p>
<p>WARWICK ’Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND No, nor your manhood that durst 438 make you stay.</p>
<p>RICHARD Northumberland, I hold thee reverently 439 .</p>
<p>Break off the parley 440 , for scarce I can refrain 441</p>
<p>The execution 442 of my big-swol’n 443 heart</p>
<p>Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD I slew thy father. Call’st thou him a child?</p>
<p>RICHARD Ay, like a dastard 444 and a treacherous coward,</p>
<p>As thou didst kill our tender 445 brother Rutland.</p>
<p>But ere sunset, I’ll make thee curse the deed.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:</p>
<p>I am a king and privileged to speak.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here</p>
<p>Cannot be cured by words: therefore be still 446 .</p>
<p>RICHARD Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:</p>
<p>By him that made us all 447 , I am resolved 448</p>
<p>That Clifford’s manhood lies 449 upon his tongue 450 .</p>
<p>EDWARD Say, Henry, shall I have my right or no?</p>
<p>A thousand men have broke their fasts 451 today,</p>
<p>That ne’er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.</p>
<p>WARWICK If thou deny 452 , their blood upon thy head,</p>
<p>For York in justice puts his armour on.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD If that be right which Warwick says is right,</p>
<p>There is no wrong, but everything is right.</p>
<p>RICHARD Whoever got 453 thee, there thy mother stands,</p>
<p>For well I wot 454 , thou hast thy mother’s tongue.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam 455 ,</p>
<p>But like a foul misshapen stigmatic 456 ,</p>
<p>Marked 457 by the destinies 458 to be avoided,</p>
<p>As venom 459 toads or lizards’ dreadful stings.</p>
<p>RICHARD Iron of Naples 460 hid with English gilt 461 ,</p>
<p>Whose father bears the title of a king</p>
<p>As if a channel 462 should be called the sea</p>
<p>Sham’st thou not 463 , knowing whence thou art extraught 464 ,</p>
<p>To let thy tongue detect 465 thy base-born heart?</p>
<p>EDWARD A wisp of straw 466 were worth a thousand crowns,</p>
<p>To make this shameless callet 467 know herself.</p>
<p>Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,</p>
<p>Although thy husband may be Menelaus 468 ;</p>
<p>And ne’er was Agamemnon’s brother 469 wronged</p>
<p>By that false woman, as this king by thee.</p>
<p>His father 470 revelled 471 in the heart of France,</p>
<p>And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop.</p>
<p>And had he 472 matched 473 according to his state 474 ,</p>
<p>He might have kept that glory to this day.</p>
<p>But when he took a beggar to his bed,</p>
<p>And graced thy poor sire 475 with his 476 bridal-day,</p>
<p>Even then that sunshine brewed a shower for him,</p>
<p>That washed his father’s fortunes forth 477 of France,</p>
<p>And heaped sedition 478 on his crown at home.</p>
<p>For what hath broached 479 this tumult but thy pride?</p>
<p>Hadst thou been meek, our title 480 still 481 had slept,</p>
<p>And we, in pity of the gentle king,</p>
<p>Had slipped 482 our claim until another age.</p>
<p>GEORGE But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring 483 ,</p>
<p>And that thy summer bred us no increase 484 ,</p>
<p>We set the axe to thy usurping root.</p>
<p>And though the edge hath something 485 hit ourselves,</p>
<p>Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,</p>
<p>We’ll never leave till we have hewn thee down,</p>
<p>Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.</p>
<p>EDWARD And in this resolution, I defy thee,</p>
<p>Not willing any longer conference,</p>
<p>Since thou denied’st 486 the gentle king to speak.</p>
<p>Sound trumpets, let our bloody colours wave,</p>
<p>And either victory or else a grave!</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Stay, Edward.</p>
<p>EDWARD No, wrangling woman, we’ll no longer stay.</p>
<p>These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
