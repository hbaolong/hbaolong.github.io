<h4 id="scene-2-716-running-scene-7">Scene 2 716 / running scene 7</h4>
<p>Enter Brutus and goes into the pulpit, and Cassius with the
Plebeians</p>
<p>PLEBEIANS We will be satisfied: let us be satisfied.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Then follow me, and give me audience 717 , friends.</p>
<p>Cassius, go you into the other street</p>
<p>And part the numbers 718 :</p>
<p>Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here;</p>
<p>Those that will follow Cassius, go with him</p>
<p>And public 719 reasons shall be renderèd 720</p>
<p>Of Caesar’s death.</p>
<p>FIRST PLEBEIAN I will hear Brutus speak.</p>
<p>SECOND PLEBEIAN I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons</p>
<p>When severally 721 we hear them renderèd.</p>
<p>[Exit Cassius, with some of the Plebeians ]</p>
<p>THIRD PLEBEIAN The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!</p>
<p>BRUTUS Be patient till the last 722 .</p>
<p>Romans, countrymen, and lovers 723 , hear me for my cause 724 and be
silent, that you may hear. Believe me for 725 mine honour and have
respect to mine honour, that you may believe. Censure 726 me in your
wisdom and awake your senses 727 , that you may the better judge. If
there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say
that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend
demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I
loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar
were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all
free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I
rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honour him: but as he was ambitious,
I slew him. There is tears, for his love: joy, for his fortune: honour,
for his valour: and death, for his ambition. Who is here so base, that
would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here
so rude 728 , that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I
offended. Who is here so vile 729 , that will not love his country? If
any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.</p>
<p>ALL None, Brutus, none.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar, than
you shall do to Brutus. The question of 730 his death is enrolled 731 in
the Capitol: his glory not extenuated 732 , wherein he was worthy, nor
his offences enforced 733 , for which he suffered death.</p>
<p>Enter Mark Antony with Caesar’s body</p>
<p>Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no
hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in
the commonwealth 734 , as which of you shall not? With this I depart,
that as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same
dagger for myself, when it shall please my country to need my death.</p>
<p>Comes down from the pulpit</p>
<p>ALL Live Brutus, live, live!</p>
<p>FIRST PLEBEIAN Bring him with triumph 735 home unto his house.</p>
<p>SECOND PLEBEIAN 736 Give him a statue with his ancestors.</p>
<p>THIRD PLEBEIAN Let him be Caesar.</p>
<p>FOURTH PLEBEIAN Caesar’s better parts 737</p>
<p>Shall be crowned 738 in Brutus.</p>
<p>FIRST PLEBEIAN We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and
clamours.</p>
<p>BRUTUS My countrymen—</p>
<p>SECOND PLEBEIAN Peace, silence, Brutus speaks.</p>
<p>FIRST PLEBEIAN Peace, ho.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Good countrymen, let me depart alone,</p>
<p>And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:</p>
<p>Do grace to 739 Caesar’s corpse and grace 740 his speech</p>
<p>Tending 741 to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony —</p>
<p>By our permission — is allowed to make.</p>
<p>I do entreat you, not a man depart</p>
<p>Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>FIRST PLEBEIAN Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony.</p>
<p>THIRD PLEBEIAN Let him go up into the public chair 742 .</p>
<p>We’ll hear him.— Noble Antony, go up.</p>
<p>ANTONY For Brutus’ sake I am beholding 743 to you.</p>
<p>Goes into the pulpit</p>
<p>FOURTH PLEBEIAN What does he say of Brutus?</p>
<p>THIRD PLEBEIAN He says, for Brutus’ sake</p>
<p>He finds himself beholding to us all.</p>
<p>FOURTH PLEBEIAN ’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.</p>
<p>FIRST PLEBEIAN This Caesar was a tyrant.</p>
<p>THIRD PLEBEIAN Nay, that’s certain:</p>
<p>We are blest that Rome is rid of him.</p>
<p>SECOND PLEBEIAN Peace, let us hear what Antony can say.</p>
<p>ANTONY You gentle Romans.</p>
<p>ALL Peace, ho, let us hear him.</p>
<p>ANTONY Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears:</p>
<p>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</p>
<p>The evil that men do lives after them:</p>
<p>The good is oft interrèd 744 with their bones.</p>
<p>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</p>
<p>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:</p>
<p>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</p>
<p>And grievously hath Caesar answered 745 it.</p>
<p>Here, under leave 746 of Brutus and the rest —</p>
<p>For Brutus is an honourable man:</p>
<p>So are they all, all honourable men —</p>
<p>Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.</p>
<p>He was my friend, faithful and just to me;</p>
<p>But Brutus says, he was ambitious,</p>
<p>And Brutus is an honourable man.</p>
<p>He hath brought many captives home to Rome,</p>
<p>Whose ransoms did the general coffers 747 fill:</p>
<p>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</p>
<p>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</p>
<p>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.</p>
<p>Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious,</p>
<p>And Brutus is an honourable man.</p>
<p>You all did see, that on the Lupercal,</p>
<p>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</p>
<p>Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?</p>
<p>Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious,</p>
<p>And sure he is an honourable man.</p>
<p>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</p>
<p>But here I am, to speak what I do know.</p>
<p>You all did love him once, not without cause:</p>
<p>What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?—</p>
<p>O judgement! Thou art fled to brutish beasts</p>
<p>And men have lost their reason.— Bear with me:</p>
<p>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</p>
<p>And I must pause till it come back to me.</p>
<p>FIRST PLEBEIAN Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</p>
<p>SECOND PLEBEIAN If thou consider rightly of the matter,</p>
<p>Caesar has had great wrong.</p>
<p>THIRD PLEBEIAN Has he, masters 748 ?</p>
<p>I fear there will a worse 749 come in his place.</p>
<p>FOURTH PLEBEIAN Marked ye his words? He would not take the crown:</p>
<p>Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious.</p>
<p>FIRST PLEBEIAN If it be found so, some will dear abide it 750 .</p>
<p>SECOND PLEBEIAN Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.</p>
<p>THIRD PLEBEIAN There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.</p>
<p>FOURTH PLEBEIAN Now mark him, he begins again to speak.</p>
<p>ANTONY But 751 yesterday the word of Caesar might</p>
<p>Have stood against 752 the world: now lies he there,</p>
<p>And none so poor 753 to do him reverence.</p>
<p>O masters! If I were disposed to stir</p>
<p>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</p>
<p>I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,</p>
<p>Who — you all know — are honourable men.</p>
<p>I will not do them wrong: I rather choose</p>
<p>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</p>
<p>Than I will wrong such honourable men.</p>
<p>But here’s a parchment, with the seal of Caesar.</p>
<p>Shows the will</p>
<p>I found it in his closet 754 : ’tis his will.</p>
<p>Let but the commons hear this testament —</p>
<p>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read —</p>
<p>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds,</p>
<p>And dip their napkins 755 in his sacred blood 756 ,</p>
<p>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</p>
<p>And, dying, mention it within their wills,</p>
<p>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</p>
<p>Unto their issue 757 .</p>
<p>FOURTH PLEBEIAN We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.</p>
<p>ALL The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will.</p>
<p>ANTONY Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it.</p>
<p>It is not meet 758 you know how Caesar loved you.</p>
<p>You are not wood, you are not stones, but men:</p>
<p>And being men, hearing the will of Caesar,</p>
<p>It will inflame you, it will make you mad;</p>
<p>’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,</p>
<p>For if you should, O, what would come of it!</p>
<p>FOURTH PLEBEIAN Read the will. We’ll hear it, Antony.</p>
<p>You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will.</p>
<p>ANTONY Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?</p>
<p>I have o’ershot myself 759 to tell you of it.</p>
<p>I fear I wrong the honourable men</p>
<p>Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar: I do fear it.</p>
<p>FOURTH PLEBEIAN They were traitors: honourable men?</p>
<p>ALL The will, the testament!</p>
<p>SECOND PLEBEIAN They were villains, murderers. The will, read the
will.</p>
<p>ANTONY You will compel me then to read the will:</p>
<p>Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,</p>
<p>And let me show you him that made the will.</p>
<p>Shall I descend? And will you give me leave?</p>
<p>ALL Come down.</p>
<p>SECOND PLEBEIAN Descend.</p>
<p>THIRD PLEBEIAN You shall have leave.</p>
<p>Antony comes down</p>
<p>FOURTH PLEBEIAN A ring. Stand round.</p>
<p>FIRST PLEBEIAN Stand from 760 the hearse 761 , stand from the
body.</p>
<p>SECOND PLEBEIAN Room for Antony, most noble Antony.</p>
<p>ANTONY Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far 762 off.</p>
<p>ALL Stand back: room, bear back.</p>
<p>ANTONY If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.</p>
<p>You all do know this mantle 763 . I remember</p>
<p>The first time ever Caesar put it on.</p>
<p>’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent,</p>
<p>That day he overcame the Nervii 764 .</p>
<p>Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through:</p>
<p>See what a rent 765 the envious Casca made:</p>
<p>Through this, the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed,</p>
<p>And as he plucked his cursèd steel away,</p>
<p>Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it,</p>
<p>As 766 rushing out of doors, to be resolved</p>
<p>If Brutus so unkindly 767 knocked or no,</p>
<p>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel 768 .—</p>
<p>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him.—</p>
<p>This was the most unkindest cut of all.</p>
<p>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</p>
<p>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,</p>
<p>Quite vanquished him: then burst his mighty heart,</p>
<p>And in his mantle muffling up his face,</p>
<p>Even at the base of Pompey’s statue —</p>
<p>Which all the while ran blood — great Caesar fell.</p>
<p>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</p>
<p>Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,</p>
<p>Whilst bloody treason flourished 769 over us.</p>
<p>O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel</p>
<p>The dint 770 of pity: these are gracious 771 drops.</p>
<p>Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold</p>
<p>Our Caesar’s vesture 772 wounded? Look you here,</p>
<p>Uncovers the body</p>
<p>Here is himself, marred 773 as you see with 774 traitors.</p>
<p>FIRST PLEBEIAN O, piteous spectacle!</p>
<p>SECOND PLEBEIAN O noble Caesar!</p>
<p>THIRD PLEBEIAN O, woeful day!</p>
<p>FOURTH PLEBEIAN O, traitors, villains!</p>
<p>FIRST PLEBEIAN O, most bloody sight!</p>
<p>SECOND PLEBEIAN We will be revenged.</p>
<p>ALL Revenge! About! 775 Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!</p>
<p>Let not a traitor live!</p>
<p>ANTONY Stay, countrymen.</p>
<p>FIRST PLEBEIAN Peace there, hear the noble Antony.</p>
<p>SECOND PLEBEIAN We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with
him.</p>
<p>ANTONY Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up</p>
<p>To such a sudden flood of mutiny:</p>
<p>They that have done this deed are honourable.</p>
<p>What private griefs 776 they have, alas, I know not,</p>
<p>That made them do it: they are wise and honourable</p>
<p>And will no doubt with reasons answer you.</p>
<p>I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:</p>
<p>I am no orator 777 , as Brutus is;</p>
<p>But as you know me all a plain blunt 778 man</p>
<p>That love my friend, and that they know full well</p>
<p>That gave me public leave to speak of him,</p>
<p>For I have neither wit 779 , nor words, nor worth,</p>
<p>Action 780 , nor utterance, nor the power of speech,</p>
<p>To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on 781 :</p>
<p>I tell you that which you yourselves do know,</p>
<p>Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,</p>
<p>And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus 782 ,</p>
<p>And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony</p>
<p>Would ruffle up 783 your spirits, and put a tongue</p>
<p>In every wound of Caesar that should move</p>
<p>The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.</p>
<p>ALL We’ll mutiny.</p>
<p>FIRST PLEBEIAN We’ll burn the house of Brutus.</p>
<p>THIRD PLEBEIAN Away, then, come, seek the conspirators.</p>
<p>ANTONY Yet hear me, countrymen, yet hear me speak.</p>
<p>ALL Peace ho, hear Antony, most noble Antony.</p>
<p>ANTONY Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:</p>
<p>Wherein 784 hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?</p>
<p>Alas, you know not. I must tell you then:</p>
<p>You have forgot the will I told you of.</p>
<p>ALL Most true. The will: let’s stay and hear the will.</p>
<p>ANTONY Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal.</p>
<p>To every Roman citizen he gives,</p>
<p>To every several 785 man, seventy-five drachmas 786 .</p>
<p>SECOND PLEBEIAN Most noble Caesar, we’ll revenge his death.</p>
<p>THIRD PLEBEIAN O royal Caesar.</p>
<p>ANTONY Hear me with patience.</p>
<p>ALL Peace ho.</p>
<p>ANTONY Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,</p>
<p>His private arbours and new-planted orchards 787 ,</p>
<p>On this side Tiber. He hath left them you</p>
<p>And to your heirs for ever: common pleasures 788</p>
<p>To walk abroad and recreate 789 yourselves.</p>
<p>Here was a Caesar: when comes such another?</p>
<p>FIRST PLEBEIAN Never, never. Come, away, away:</p>
<p>We’ll burn his body in the holy place,</p>
<p>And with the brands 790 fire 791 the traitors’ houses.</p>
<p>Take up the body.</p>
<p>SECOND PLEBEIAN Go fetch fire.</p>
<p>THIRD PLEBEIAN Pluck down benches.</p>
<p>FOURTH PLEBEIAN Pluck down forms 792 , windows 793 , anything.</p>
<p>Exeunt Plebeians</p>
<p>With the body</p>
<p>ANTONY Now let it work. Mischief 794 , thou art afoot:</p>
<p>Take thou what course thou wilt.—</p>
<p>Enter Servant</p>
<p>How now, fellow?</p>
<p>SERVANT Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.</p>
<p>ANTONY Where is he?</p>
<p>SERVANT He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.</p>
<p>ANTONY And thither will I straight 795 , to visit him:</p>
<p>He comes upon a wish 796 . Fortune is merry 797</p>
<p>And in this mood will give us anything.</p>
<p>SERVANT I heard him say Brutus and Cassius</p>
<p>Are rid 798 like madmen through the gates of Rome.</p>
<p>ANTONY Belike 799 they had some notice of 800 the people</p>
<p>How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
