continues</h4>
<p>Enter Luciana with Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p>LUCIANA And may it be that you have quite forgot</p>
<p>A husband’s office? Shall, Antipholus,</p>
<p>Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs 495 rot?</p>
<p>Shall love in building 496 grow so ruinous?</p>
<p>If you did wed my sister for her wealth,</p>
<p>Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness.</p>
<p>Or if you like elsewhere 497 , do it by stealth:</p>
<p>Muffle 498 your false 499 love with some show of blindness 500 .</p>
<p>Let not my sister read it in your eye,</p>
<p>Be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator 501 .</p>
<p>Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty 502 ,</p>
<p>Apparel vice like virtue’s harbinger 503 ,</p>
<p>Bear a fair 504 presence though your heart be tainted,</p>
<p>Teach sin the carriage 505 of a holy saint,</p>
<p>Be secret-false 506 . What need she be acquainted?</p>
<p>What simple thief brags of his own attaint? 507</p>
<p>’Tis double wrong to truant with your bed</p>
<p>And let her read it in thy looks at board 508 .</p>
<p>Shame hath a bastard fame 509 , well managèd,</p>
<p>Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.</p>
<p>Alas, poor women, make us but believe —</p>
<p>Being compact of credit 510 — that you love us.</p>
<p>Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve 511 .</p>
<p>We in your motion 512 turn, and you may move 513 us.</p>
<p>Then, gentle brother, get you in again,</p>
<p>Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:</p>
<p>’Tis holy sport to be a little vain 514 ,</p>
<p>When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Sweet mistress, what your name is else 515 I
know not,</p>
<p>Nor by what wonder 516 you do hit of 517 mine,</p>
<p>Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not</p>
<p>Than our earth’s wonder 518 , more than earth 519 divine.</p>
<p>Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak.</p>
<p>Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit 520 ,</p>
<p>Smothered in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,</p>
<p>The folded 521 meaning of your words’ deceit.</p>
<p>Against my soul’s pure truth, why labour you</p>
<p>To make it wander in an unknown field?</p>
<p>Are you a god? Would you create me new 522 ?</p>
<p>Transform me then, and to your power I’ll yield.</p>
<p>But if that I am I, then well I know,</p>
<p>Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,</p>
<p>Nor to her bed no homage 523 do I owe.</p>
<p>Far more, far more to you do I decline 524 .</p>
<p>O, train 525 me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note 526 ,</p>
<p>To drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears.</p>
<p>Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote 527 .</p>
<p>Spread o’er the silver waves thy golden hairs,</p>
<p>And as a bed I’ll take them, and there lie,</p>
<p>And in that glorious supposition 528 think</p>
<p>He gains by death that 529 hath such means to die 530 .</p>
<p>Let love, being light, be drownèd if she sink 531 .</p>
<p>LUCIANA What, are you mad that you do reason so?</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Not mad, but mated 532 , how, I do not
know.</p>
<p>LUCIANA It is a fault that springeth from your eye.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE For gazing on your beams 533 , fair sun, being
by.</p>
<p>LUCIANA Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE As good to wink 534 , sweet love, as look on
night.</p>
<p>LUCIANA Why call you me love? Call my sister so.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thy sister’s sister.</p>
<p>LUCIANA That’s my sister.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE No:</p>
<p>It is thyself, mine own self’s better part,</p>
<p>Mine eye’s clear eye, my dear heart’s dearer heart,</p>
<p>My food, my fortune and my sweet hope’s aim,</p>
<p>My sole earth’s heaven and my heaven’s claim 535 .</p>
<p>LUCIANA All this my sister is, or else should be.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee 536
.</p>
<p>Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life;</p>
<p>Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife:</p>
<p>Give me thy hand.</p>
<p>LUCIANA O, soft, sir, hold you still:</p>
<p>I’ll fetch my sister, to get her good will 537 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p>Running</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Why, how now, Dromio, where runn’st thou so
fast?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio? Am I your man?
Am I myself?</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art
thyself.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I am an ass, I am a woman’s man and besides 538
myself.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What woman’s man? And how besides thyself
?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman:
one that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have 539 me.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What claim lays she to thee?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your
horse, and she would have me as a beast 540 — not that, I being a beast,
she would have me, but that she, being a very beastly creature, lays
claim to me.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUSS What is she?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE A very reverent 541 body: ay, such a one as a man
may not speak of, without he say ‘sir-reverence’ 542 . I have but lean
543 luck in the match, and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE How dost thou mean a fat marriage?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry, sir, she’s the kitchen wench 544 and all
grease 545 , and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of
her and run from her by her own light. I warrant her rags and the tallow
546 in them will burn a Poland winter 547 . If she lives till doomsday,
she’ll burn a week 548 longer than the whole world.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What complexion 549 is she of ?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Swart 550 , like my shoe, but her face nothing
like so clean kept: for why? She sweats 551 a man may go over 552 shoes
in the grime of it.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE That’s a fault that water will mend.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No, sir, ’tis in grain 553 . Noah’s flood could
not do it.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What’s her name?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Nell, sir. But her name and three quarters —
that’s an ell 554 and three quarters — will not measure her from hip to
hip.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Then she bears some breadth?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:
she is spherical, like a globe. I could find out 555 countries in
her.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE In what part of her body stands Ireland?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry, sir, in her buttocks: I found it out by the
bogs 556 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where Scotland?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I found it by the barrenness, hard in the palm of
the hand 557 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where France?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE In her forehead, armed and reverted 558 , making
war against her hair.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where England?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I looked for the chalky cliffs 559 , but I could
find no whiteness in them. But I guess it stood in her chin, by the salt
560 rheum that ran between France and it.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where Spain?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in her
breath 561 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where America, the Indies?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O sir, upon her nose, all o’er embellished with
rubies, carbuncles, sapphires 562 , declining their rich aspect 563 to
the hot breath of Spain, who sent whole armadoes of carracks to be
ballast 564 at her nose.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where stood Belgia 565 , the Netherlands 566
?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this
drudge 567 or diviner 568 laid claim to me, called me Dromio, swore I
was assured 569 to her, told me what privy 570 marks I had about me, as
the mark of 571 my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my
left arm, that I, amazed, ran from her as a witch. And, I think, if my
breast had not been made of faith, and my heart of steel, she had
transformed me to a curtal dog 572 and made me turn i’th’wheel 573 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Go, hie 574 thee presently 575 , post 576 to
the road 577 ,</p>
<p>An if 578 the wind blow any way from shore 579 ,</p>
<p>I will not harbour 580 in this town tonight.</p>
<p>If any bark put forth 581 , come to the mart,</p>
<p>Where I will walk till thou return to me.</p>
<p>If everyone knows us and we know none,</p>
<p>’Tis time, I think, to trudge 582 , pack and be gone.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE As from a bear a man would run for life,</p>
<p>So fly I from her that would be my wife.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE There’s none but witches 583 do inhabit
here,</p>
<p>And therefore ’tis high time that I were hence.</p>
<p>She that doth call me husband, even my 584 soul</p>
<p>Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,</p>
<p>Possessed with such a gentle sovereign 585 grace,</p>
<p>Of such enchanting presence and discourse,</p>
<p>Hath almost made me traitor to myself.</p>
<p>But, lest myself be guilty to 586 self-wrong,</p>
<p>I’ll stop mine ears against the mermaid’s song.</p>
<p>Enter Angelo with the chain</p>
<p>ANGELO Master Antipholus.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Ay, that’s my name.</p>
<p>ANGELO I know it well, sir, lo 587 , here is the chain.</p>
<p>I thought to have ta’en you 588 at the Porpentine,</p>
<p>The chain unfinished made me stay 589 thus long.</p>
<p>Gives the chain</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What is your will that I shall do with
this?</p>
<p>ANGELO What please 590 yourself, sir: I have made it for you.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Made it for me, sir? I bespoke 591 it not.</p>
<p>ANGELO Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.</p>
<p>Go home with it and please your wife withal,</p>
<p>And soon at supper-time I’ll visit you,</p>
<p>And then receive my money for the chain.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I pray you, sir, receive the money now,</p>
<p>For fear you ne’er see chain nor money more.</p>
<p>ANGELO You are a merry man, sir, fare you well.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What I should think of this, I cannot
tell,</p>
<p>But this I think: there’s no man is so vain 592</p>
<p>That would refuse so fair an offered chain.</p>
<p>I see a man here needs not live by shifts 593 ,</p>
<p>When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.</p>
<p>I’ll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay 594 ,</p>
<p>If any ship put out, then straight away.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
