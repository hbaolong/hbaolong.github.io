<h4 id="introduction-to-measure-for-measure">Introduction to Measure for
Measure</h4>
<p>The most widely read book in Shakespeare’s England was the ‘Geneva’
translation of the Bible. Because of this, the title of Measure for
Measure would have been readily recognized by the play’s original
audience as an allusion to the opening verses of the seventh chapter of
Saint Matthew’s gospel:</p>
<p>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</p>
<p>For with what judgement ye judge, ye shall be judged, and with what
measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</p>
<p>And why see’st thou the mote, that is in thy brother’s eye, and
perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</p>
<p>The running head summarizing the content of this page in the Geneva
Bible reads ‘Christ’s doctrine - God’s providence’. Of all Shakespeare’s
plays, Measure for Measure is the one in which the dramatization of
Christian doctrine and the motions of divine providence are most
prominent. Angelo sees the mote in Claudio’s eye (getting his girlfriend
Juliet pregnant before marrying her, albeit after becoming engaged to
her) and fails to perceive the beam in his own (dumping his girlfriend
Mariana upon discovering that she hasn’t got any money). He judges
Claudio, but the duke contrives to judge him by his own measure.</p>
<p>The Geneva Bible included interpretative glosses in its margins.
Beside the ‘measure for measure’ verses appeared the admonition
‘hypocrites hide their own faults, and seek not to amend them, but are
curious to reprove other men’s’. That could as well be an instant
character sketch of Angelo. He is more than once described as ‘precise’,
a term applied to no other character in Shakespeare. It was a word that
often went with ‘puritan’, as may be seen from the way in which
Shakespeare’s acquaintance John Florio defined the phrase Gabba santi in
his Anglo-Italian dictionary: ‘a precise dissembling puritan, an
hypocrite’.</p>
<p>Despite the steer given by the title, the play is much more tangled
than the old drama on which it was based, George Whetstone’s History of
Promos and Cassandra , which showed ‘the unsufferable abuse of a lewd
magistrate’, ‘the virtuous behaviour of a chaste lady’ and ‘the perfect
magnanimity of a noble king in checking vice and favouring virtue’, all
for the purpose of revealing ‘the ruin and overthrow of dishonest
practices’ and ‘the advancement of upright dealing’. Shakespeare took
Whetstone’s basic plot line and principal characters - the indecent
proposal, the hypocritical dealing of the lawgiver, the beautiful
gentlewoman asked to give up her chastity in return for her brother’s
life, the ruler who returns and sorts everything out - but greatly
complicated the moral vision. Whetstone’s character of Promos has two
anguished soliloquies in which he reflects on his desire for Cassandra.
They offer a structural anticipation of Angelo’s self-questioning
‘What’s this? What’s this? Is this her fault or mine? / The tempter or
the tempted, who sins most? Ha?’ and ‘When I would pray and think, I
think and pray / To several subjects.’ Whetstone, however, lacks
Shakespeare’s gift of writing soliloquy with meditative pauses, shifts
between argument and emotion, and rhetorical twists that create the
illusion that the character is having the thought as he speaks rather
than speechifying on a predetermined theme. Promos’ dilemma is set up in
terms of a simple opposition between reason and desire; with Angelo, on
the other hand, it is the force of Isabella’s reason - her powers of
linguistic persuasion - that inflames his desire. He wants her not
because she’s beautiful or even because she is on the verge of taking a
vow of perpetual chastity, but because he loves to see her mind and
tongue at work. ‘She speaks, and ’tis such sense / That my sense breeds
with it.’ Here rational sense is the very thing that stirs sensuality.
In a good production, sexual chemistry crackles between Angelo and
Isabella even as she resists him. Being a man who is used to getting his
way, he does not realize how much he loves it when he does not. Two
strong wills strain against each other. As we watch, there is a little
part of us that anticipates - or even hopes - that they will end up
marrying each other in the manner of Shakespeare’s other sparring
couples, Petruchio and Kate, Berowne and Rosaline, Beatrice and
Benedick.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the Mariana plot line is Shakespeare’s key innovation
in the plot: Whetstone’s play and the various sixteenth-century Italian
versions of the story do not have the ‘bed trick’ and they end with the
king or duke punishing the Angelo figure by having him marry the
Isabella figure (in order to repair her honour) before being executed.
The Isabella figure then intervenes, professes her love for the man who
has abused her, he is pardoned and they live happily ever after.
Shakespeare transposes these turns onto Mariana and saves Angelo from
execution. Mercy prevails over justice: it should be remembered that the
‘measure for measure’ passage in Saint Matthew’s gospel is at the heart
of the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus lays out his moral code,
sharply distinguishing his new covenant of forgiveness from the harsher
‘eye for an eye’ law of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The introduction of Mariana into the story displaces the marriage
plot from Isabella, seemingly leaving her free to return to the nunnery
and take her final vows. But the play ends with the wholly unexpected
twist of the duke’s proposal. In one way, it is a fitting union. Having
made the wrong choice of deputy (Escalus would have done the job much
better), the duke makes the right choice of wife: Isabella will bring to
his household the moral fibre that has been lacking, without any of
Angelo’s hypocrisy. Her ‘ghostly father’ will become her husband and the
mother superior of the nunnery will have to do without her: the monastic
virtues will be brought from the contemplative to the active life, from
the cloister to the secular state, in a manner characteristic of the
sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation. In another way, though, it is
an astonishing ending. This has not been a courtship comedy. And is
there not a little touch of moral blackmail in the proposal? Angelo’s
proposition was: sleep with me and I will save your brother’s life. The
duke’s is: I have saved your brother’s life, so marry me.</p>
<p>It has sometimes been argued that Shakespeare was becoming bored with
comedy’s conventional happy ending in multiple marriages. Perhaps this
is a parody of a comic ending. He certainly turned away from comedy in
the next few years of his writing career. Strikingly, Isabella does not
respond to the proposal. Does she fall into the duke’s arms with silent
and submissive joy? Or look puzzled? Or aghast? Some productions of the
play leave the ending open, with a kind of freeze-frame effect. It is
not unknown - though without textual warrant - for Isabella to look the
duke up and down, then turn away and march back to the sisterhood.</p>
<p>The puzzle over the ending is bound up with broader interpretative
anxieties about the duke. He may be regarded as a God-like figure,
benignly controlling the world of the play from behind the scenes. But
is it healthy for a human to take on the role of divine providence?
Angelo is a moral hypocrite, but it should not be forgotten that the
origin of the word ‘hypocrite’ is the Greek term for an actor. It is the
duke who is the role-player, the actor. Does he have the right to
impersonate a friar and hear the confessions of Claudio and Mariana?
‘Confess’ is another of the play’s key words, used in both its spiritual
and judicial senses.</p>
<p>The part of Lucio is considerably bigger than that of Angelo. Where
Angelo is a false-seeming angel crested with the devil’s horn, Lucio
plays a seductive Lucifer to the duke’s God. To adapt what William Blake
said of John Milton’s Paradise Lost , Shakespeare was a true poet and of
the devil’s party without (perhaps) knowing it. Lucio speaks deep truths
in light language: the extinction of sexual desire would require the
gelding and spaying of all the youth of the city; the duke is in certain
senses a creature of ‘dark corners’. It is almost the first law of the
Shakespearean universe that the voice of the devil’s advocate should not
be silenced. ‘I am a kind of burr’, says Lucio, ‘I shall stick.’</p>
<p>The first recorded performance of Measure for Measure took place on
26 December 1604 as part of the royal Christmas festivities. It was,
then, one of the first plays written by Shakespeare for his new monarch.
Within weeks of Queen Elizabeth’s death in 1603, Shakespeare’s acting
company had been renamed the King’s Men. Over the next ten years they
played at court between a dozen and twenty times a year, far more often
than any other company. Though the duke is by no means an allegorical
representation of King James, the play reveals Shakespeare moving into
territory that fascinated the king: a concern with slander and
reputation, an anatomy of the secret springs of power as opposed to a
public display of majesty in the style of Queen Elizabeth’s pageants and
processions (‘I love the people, / But do not like to stage me to their
eyes’), a demonstration of the intricacies of theological and moral
debate (one of James’ first acts on arriving in London was to convene a
conference at Hampton Court in which he participated in the contentions
of high and low churchmen over such matters as the estate of holy
matrimony and the question of who could legitimately perform the
sacraments). The king would therefore have been the ideal spectator for
such set pieces as the duke’s rhetorical mortification of Claudio (‘Be
absolute for death’). An acute ironist himself, he would have enjoyed
the irony whereby Claudio is instantly persuaded by the duke’s richly
rendered argument, only to change his position a few minutes later when
his sister tells him of Angelo’s offer - at which point he voices a
speech about the horrors of bodily decay and spiritual damnation that is
the very antithesis of the duke’s argument against life.</p>
<p>Though the play is set in Vienna, the brothels in the ‘suburbs’ or
‘liberties’ of the city evoke the London in which it was performed,
where theatre and the sex trade stood side by side on the south bank of
the Thames. The malapropisms of Constable Elbow, meanwhile, are in the
vein of very English humour associated with Dogberry in Much Ado about
Nothing and Mistress Quickly in The Merry Wives of Windsor . At the same
time, the play has the whiff of both sexual licence and political
intrigue that the Elizabethans and Jacobeans associated with Italy. The
duke’s plan to get Angelo to do his dirty work for him could be read as
a political strategy deriving from the pages of Machiavelli.</p>
<p>A drama is always a species of trial, in which actions, motives and
ideas are tested before the jury of an audience. The Duke of Vienna -
like Duke Prospero of Milan in The Tempest - is a dramatist engaged upon
a test. How is unbridled carnal licence best restrained, in order to
save society from the ravages of sexual disease and the burden of
unwanted children? By extreme puritanism of the kind advocated by
Angelo? This solution is tested and found severely wanting. What does
the duke offer in its place? In theory the answer is a middle road
between justice and mercy, licence and restraint. The technical term for
this third way is ‘temperance’, a key virtue in classical ethics. The
duke, says Escalus, is ‘A gentleman of all temperance.’ Temperance,
however, depends on everyone behaving reasonably and obeying the rule of
moderation. What Shakespeare recognizes - as the duke does not - is that
people simply cannot be relied upon to show perpetual temperance. So it
is that at the very centre of the action we find the extraordinary bit
part of Barnardine, the man who announces that he will not be executed
today, thank you very much, because he has a hangover. The whole of the
duke’s plot nearly collapses because of him. It is only salvaged by the
palpably improbable device of inventing the pirate Ragozine who just
happens to look like Claudio and to die at the right moment. Barnardine,
wrote the great nineteenth-century essayist William Hazlitt, ‘is a fine
antithesis to the morality and the hypocrisy of the other characters of
the play’.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: The Duke of Vienna decides to leave the city for a while,
appointing his deputy, Angelo, to govern in his absence. Angelo resolves
to revive vigorous laws against sexual licence, which have fallen into
disuse. Under these laws a young gentleman, Claudio, is sentenced to
death for having made his fiancée Juliet pregnant before their wedding
ceremony. Claudio’s sister Isabella, a novice nun, is persuaded by his
friend Lucio to plead with Angelo for her brother’s life. Angelo
promises to free Claudio if Isabella will sleep with him. She refuses
and tells her brother that she must keep her honour and he, therefore,
must die. The duke has stayed in Vienna disguised as a friar observing
the new regime and he now persuades Isabella to pretend to accede to
Angelo’s demands. Her place in Angelo’s bed is secretly taken by
Mariana, Angelo’s former fiancée whom he deserted. After the event,
Angelo betrays Isabella by trying to carry out Claudio’s execution but
his plans are foiled by the duke’s intervention.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Duke (30%/194/9), Isabella (15%/129/8), Lucio (11%/111/5),
Angelo (11%/83/5), Escalus (7%/78/5), Provost (6%/65/7), Pompey
(6%/60/4), Claudio (4%/35/4), Elbow (2%/28/2), Mariana (2%/24/3),
Overdone (1%/15/2).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 65% verse, 35% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: Performed at court 26 December 1604, probably written earlier
the same year.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Main plot from George Whetstone’s two-part play Promos and
Cassandra (1578) and the novella in Giraldi Cinthio’s Hecatommithi
(1565) that was Whetstone’s source; the bed trick was a common romance
motif, though not in these sources; the ‘disguised duke’ motif appears
in a number of contemporaneous plays, such as John Marston’s The
Malcontent and Thomas Middleton’s The Phoenix (both c.1603).</p>
<p>TEXT: The 1623 Folio is the only early text. It was typeset from a
transcript by the scribe Ralph Crane, though the nature of Crane’s copy
is not clear. The absence of swear words from the play’s seamy
underbelly suggests a theatrical script from after the 1606 Act against
profanity. The song at the beginning of Act 4 also occurs (with a second
stanza) in Rollo Duke of Normandy by John Fletcher and others (1616-19).
It has been suggested that the song, perhaps together with the ensuing
dialogue between the duke and Mariana, was introduced as part of a
revision of the play in which a five-act structure was imposed. The
soliloquy ‘O place and greatness’ (4.1.59) has often been regarded as an
interpolation. The duke is unnamed in the text, but called Vincentio in
Crane’s list of parts. These, and other minor inconsistencies and loose
ends, have led to the supposition that the Folio text is a theatrical
adaptation - in which some have detected the hand of Thomas Middleton -
as opposed to a pure Shakespearean original.</p>
