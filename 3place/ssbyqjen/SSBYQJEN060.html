<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-14">Scene 2 ／ running scene 14</h4>
<p>Enter Falstaff [and ] Mistress Ford</p>
<p>The basket is brought out</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance 880 .
I see you are obsequious 881 in your love, and I profess requital to a
hair’s breadth, not only, Mistress Ford, in the simple office 882 of
love, but in all the accoutrement 883 , complement 884 and ceremony of
it. But are you sure of 885 your husband now?</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD He’s a-birding, sweet Sir John.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE What, ho, gossip 886 Ford! What, ho!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Step into th’chamber, Sir John.</p>
<p>[Exit Falstaff ]</p>
<p>[Enter Mistress Page ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE How now, sweetheart, who’s at home besides
yourself?</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Why, none but mine own people 887 .</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Indeed?</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD No, certainly.— Speak louder.</p>
<p>Whispers to her</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Why?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Why, woman, your husband is in his old lines 888 again:
he so takes on 889 yonder with my husband, so rails against all married
mankind, so curses all Eve’s daughters of what complexion 890 soever,
and so buffets himself on the forehead, crying, ‘Peer out 891 , peer
out!’, that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but tameness, civility
and patience to 892 this his distemper he is in now. I am glad the fat
knight is not here.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Why, does he talk of him?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Of none but him, and swears he was carried out, the
last time he searched for him, in a basket: protests to my husband he is
now here, and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their
sport to make another experiment 893 of his suspicion. But I am glad the
knight is not here: now he shall see his own foolery.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD How near is he, Mistress Page?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Hard by, at street end. He will be here anon.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD I am undone. The knight is here.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Why then you are utterly shamed, and he’s but a dead
man. What a woman are you? Away with him, away with him! Better shame
than murder.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Which way should he go? How should I bestow 894 him?
Shall I put him into the basket again?</p>
<p>[Enter Falstaff ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF No, I’ll come no more i’th’basket. May I not go out ere he
come?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Alas, three of Master Ford’s brothers watch the door
with pistols, that none shall issue out: otherwise you might slip away
ere he came. But what make you 895 here?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What shall I do? I’ll creep up into the chimney.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD There they always use to discharge their birding-pieces
896 . Creep into the kiln-hole 897 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Where is it?</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD He will seek there, on my word. Neither press, coffer,
chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an abstract 898 for the
remembrance of such places, and goes to them by his note: there is no
hiding you in the house.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I’ll go out then.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE If you go out in your own semblance 899 , you die, Sir
John — unless you go out disguised.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD How might we disguise him?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Alas the day, I know not. There is no woman’s gown big
enough for him: otherwise he might put on a hat, a muffler 900 and a
kerchief, and so escape.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather than a
mischief 901 .</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD My maid’s aunt, the fat woman of Brentford 902 , has a
gown above 903 .</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE On my word, it will serve him: she’s as big as he is —
and there’s her thrummed 904 hat and her muffler too. Run up, Sir
John.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Go, go, sweet Sir John. Mistress Page and I will look
905 some linen for your head.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Quick, quick! We’ll come dress you straight 906 : put
on the gown the while 907 .</p>
<p>[Exit Falstaff ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD I would my husband would meet him in this shape 908 .
He cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears she’s a witch,
forbade her my house and hath threatened to beat her.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Heaven guide him to thy husband’s cudgel, and the devil
guide his cudgel afterwards!</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD But is my husband coming?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Ay, in good sadness 909 is he, and talks of the basket
too, howsoever he hath had intelligence 910 .</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD We’ll try 911 that, for I’ll appoint my men to carry
the basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as they did last
time.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Nay, but he’ll be here presently. Let’s go dress him
like the witch of Brentford.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD I’ll first direct my men what they shall do with the
basket. Go up, I’ll bring linen for him straight.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Hang him, dishonest 912 varlet! We cannot misuse him
enough.</p>
<p>We’ll leave a proof, by that which we will do,</p>
<p>Wives may be merry, and yet honest 913 too.</p>
<p>We do not act 914 that often jest and laugh,</p>
<p>’Tis old but true: still 915 swine eat all the draff 916 .</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>[Enter Mistress Ford with John and Robert ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders. Your
master is hard at 917 door. If he bid you set it down, obey him.
Quickly, dispatch 918 .</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>JOHN Come, come, take it up.</p>
<p>ROBERT Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.</p>
<p>JOHN I hope not, I had as lief 919 bear so much lead.</p>
<p>John and Robert lift the basket</p>
<p>[Enter Ford, Page, Shallow, Caius and Evans ]</p>
<p>FORD Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any way then to
unfool me again? 920 — Set down the basket, villain.</p>
<p>John and Robert set down the basket</p>
<p>Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket! O, you panderly 921
rascals, there’s a knot, a gin 922 , a pack, a conspiracy against me.
Now shall the devil be shamed 923 . What, wife, I say! Come, come forth.
Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching.</p>
<p>PAGE Why, this passes 924 , Master Ford. You are not to go loose any
longer, you must be pinioned 925 .</p>
<p>EVANS Why, this is lunatics, this is mad as a mad dog!</p>
<p>SHALLOW Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well indeed.</p>
<p>FORD So say I too, sir.</p>
<p>[Enter Mistress Ford ]</p>
<p>Come hither, Mistress Ford — Mistress Ford the honest woman, the
modest wife, the virtuous creature, that hath the jealous fool to her
husband. I suspect without cause, mistress, do I?</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me in any
dishonesty.</p>
<p>FORD Well said, brazen-face, hold it out 926 ! Come forth,
sirrah!</p>
<p>Pulls clothes out of the basket</p>
<p>PAGE This passes.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Are you not ashamed? Let the clothes alone.</p>
<p>FORD I shall find you anon.</p>
<p>EVANS ’Tis unreasonable. Will you take up your wife’s clothes? Come
away.</p>
<p>FORD Empty the basket, I say!</p>
<p>To John and Robert</p>
<p>PAGE Why, man, why?</p>
<p>FORD Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed out of my
house yesterday in this basket. Why may not he be there again? In my
house I am sure he is. My intelligence is true, my jealousy is
reasonable. Pluck me out all the linen.</p>
<p>To John and Robert</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD If you find a man there, he shall die a flea’s death
927 .</p>
<p>John and Robert empty the basket</p>
<p>PAGE Here’s no man.</p>
<p>SHALLOW By my fidelity 928 , this is not well, Master Ford. This
wrongs you.</p>
<p>EVANS Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the imaginations of
your own heart. This is jealousies.</p>
<p>FORD Well, he’s not here I seek for.</p>
<p>PAGE No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.</p>
<p>FORD Help to search my house this one time. If I find not what I
seek, show no colour for my extremity 929 , let me forever be your
table-sport 930 . Let them say of me, ‘As jealous as Ford, that searched
a hollow walnut for his wife’s leman 931 .’ Satisfy me once more, once
more search with me.</p>
<p>John and Robert refill the basket and exeunt with it</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD What, ho, Mistress Page, come you and the old woman
down. My husband will come into the chamber.</p>
<p>FORD Old woman? What old woman’s that?</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Why, it is my maid’s aunt of Brentford.</p>
<p>FORD A witch, a quean 932 , an old cozening 933 quean! Have I not
forbid her my house? She comes of 934 errands, does she? We are simple
men, we do not know what’s brought to pass under the profession 935 of
fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells, by th’figure 936 , and
such daubery 937 as this is, beyond our element 938 . We know nothing.
Come down, you witch, you hag, you! Come down, I say!</p>
<p>Takes a cudgel</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Nay, good sweet husband.— Good gentlemen, let him not
strike the old woman.</p>
<p>[Enter Mistress Page leading Falstaff in woman’s clothes ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Come, Mother Prat 939 , come, give me your hand.</p>
<p>FORD I’ll prat 940 her. Out of my door, you witch, you rag 941 , you
baggage, you polecat, you runnion 942 ! Out, out! I’ll conjure you, I’ll
fortune-tell you.</p>
<p>Beats Falstaff</p>
<p>[Exit Falstaff ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Are you not ashamed? I think you have killed the poor
woman.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Nay, he will do it. ’Tis a goodly credit for you 943
.</p>
<p>FORD Hang her, witch!</p>
<p>EVANS By yea and no 944 , I think the ’oman is a witch indeed. I like
not when a ’oman has a great peard. I spy a great peard under his
muffler.</p>
<p>FORD Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you, follow. See but the
issue of my jealousy. If I cry out thus upon no trail 945 , never trust
me when I open 946 again.</p>
<p>PAGE Let’s obey his humour 947 a little further. Come, gentlemen.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Ford, Page, Shallow, Caius and Evans ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Nay, by th’mass, that he did not: he beat him most
unpitifully, methought.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE I’ll have the cudgel hallowed 948 and hung o’er the
altar. It hath done meritorious 949 service.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD What think you? May we, with the warrant 950 of
womanhood and the witness of a good conscience, pursue him with any
further revenge?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE The spirit of wantonness 951 is, sure, scared out of
him. If the devil have him not in fee-simple 952 , with fine and
recovery 953 , he will never, I think, in the way of waste 954 , attempt
us again.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Shall we tell our husbands how we have served 955
him?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Yes, by all means, if it be but to scrape the figures
956 out of your husband’s brains. If they can find in their hearts the
poor unvirtuous fat knight shall be any further afflicted, we two will
still be the ministers 957 .</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD I’ll warrant they’ll have him publicly shamed, and
methinks there would be no period 958 to the jest, should he not be
publicly shamed.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Come, to the forge with it, then shape it 959 . I would
not have things cool.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
