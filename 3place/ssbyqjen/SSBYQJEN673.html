<h4 id="scene-3-589-running-scene-7">Scene 3 589 ／running scene 7</h4>
<p>Enter the Duke of Hereford [Bullingbrook ] and Northumberland</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Believe me, noble lord,</p>
<p>I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire.</p>
<p>These high wild hills and rough uneven ways</p>
<p>Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome.</p>
<p>And yet our fair discourse hath been as sugar,</p>
<p>Making the hard way sweet and delectable.</p>
<p>But I bethink me what a weary way</p>
<p>From Ravenspurgh to Cottshold 590 will be found</p>
<p>In 591 Ross and Willoughby, wanting 592 your company,</p>
<p>Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled 593</p>
<p>The tediousness and process 594 of my travel.</p>
<p>But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have</p>
<p>The present benefit that I possess;</p>
<p>And hope to joy is little less in joy</p>
<p>Than hope enjoyed. By this 595 the weary lords</p>
<p>Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done</p>
<p>By sight of what I have, your noble company.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Of much less value is my company</p>
<p>Than your good words. But who comes here?</p>
<p>Enter Harry Percy</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND It is my son, young Harry Percy,</p>
<p>Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever 596 .——</p>
<p>Harry, how fares your uncle?</p>
<p>PERCY I had thought, my lord, to have learned his health of you.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Why, is he not with the queen?</p>
<p>PERCY No, my good lord. He hath forsook 597 the court,</p>
<p>Broken his staff of office and dispersed</p>
<p>The household of the king.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND What was his reason?</p>
<p>He was not so resolved when we last spake together.</p>
<p>PERCY Because your lordship was proclaimèd traitor.</p>
<p>But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh</p>
<p>To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,</p>
<p>And sent me over by Berkeley to discover</p>
<p>What power the Duke of York had levied 598 there,</p>
<p>Then with direction to repair 599 to Ravenspurgh.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?</p>
<p>PERCY No, my good lord, for that is not forgot</p>
<p>Which ne’er I did remember: to my knowledge,</p>
<p>I never in my life did look on him.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Then learn to know him now: this is the duke.</p>
<p>PERCY My gracious lord, I tender 600 you my service,</p>
<p>Such as it is, being tender, raw and young,</p>
<p>Which elder days shall ripen and confirm</p>
<p>To more approvèd 601 service and desert.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK I thank thee, gentle 602 Percy, and be sure</p>
<p>I count myself in nothing else so happy</p>
<p>As in a soul rememb’ring my good friends.</p>
<p>And as my fortune 603 ripens with thy love,</p>
<p>It shall be still 604 thy true love’s recompense.</p>
<p>My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.</p>
<p>Gives Percy his hand</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND How far is it to Berkeley? And what stir 605</p>
<p>Keeps good old York there with his men of war?</p>
<p>PERCY There stands the castle, by yond 606 tuft 607 of trees,</p>
<p>Manned with three hundred men, as I have heard.</p>
<p>And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley and Seymour,</p>
<p>None else of name and noble estimate 608 .</p>
<p>Enter Ross and Willoughby</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,</p>
<p>Bloody with spurring 609 , fiery-red with haste.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Welcome, my lords. I wot 610 your love pursues</p>
<p>A banished traitor. All my treasury</p>
<p>Is yet but unfelt 611 thanks, which 612 more enriched</p>
<p>Shall be your love and labour’s recompense.</p>
<p>ROSS Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.</p>
<p>WILLOUGHBY And far surmounts our labour to attain it.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Evermore thanks —— th’exchequer of the poor 613 ,</p>
<p>Which, till my infant fortune comes to years 614 ,</p>
<p>Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?</p>
<p>Enter Berkeley</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.</p>
<p>BERKELEY My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK My lord, my answer is —— to Lancaster 615 ,</p>
<p>And I am come to seek that name in England.</p>
<p>And I must find that title in your tongue,</p>
<p>Before I make reply to aught 616 you say.</p>
<p>BERKELEY Mistake me not, my lord, ’tis not my meaning</p>
<p>To raze 617 one title 618 of your honour out.</p>
<p>To you, my lord, I come —— what lord you will 619 ——</p>
<p>From the most glorious 620 of this land,</p>
<p>The Duke of York, to know what pricks 621 you on</p>
<p>To take advantage of the absent time 622</p>
<p>And fright our native 623 peace with self-born 624 arms.</p>
<p>Enter York [with Attendants ]</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK I shall not need transport my words by you.</p>
<p>Here comes his grace in person.—— My noble uncle!</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>YORK Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,</p>
<p>Whose duty is deceivable 625 and false.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK My gracious uncle——</p>
<p>YORK Tut, tut! Grace me no grace 626 , nor uncle me no uncle.</p>
<p>I am no traitor’s uncle; and that word ‘grace’</p>
<p>In an ungracious 627 mouth is but profane.</p>
<p>Why have these banished and forbidden legs</p>
<p>Dared once to touch a dust 628 of England’s ground?</p>
<p>But then more ‘why’: why have they dared to march</p>
<p>So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,</p>
<p>Frighting her pale-faced villages with war</p>
<p>And ostentation of despisèd 629 arms?</p>
<p>Com’st thou because th’anointed king is hence?</p>
<p>Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,</p>
<p>And in my loyal bosom lies his power.</p>
<p>Were I but now the lord of such hot youth</p>
<p>As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself</p>
<p>Rescued the Black Prince 630 , that young Mars of men,</p>
<p>From forth the ranks of many thousand French,</p>
<p>O, then how quickly should this arm of mine,</p>
<p>Now prisoner to the palsy 631 , chastise thee</p>
<p>And minister correction to thy fault!</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK My gracious uncle, let me know my fault.</p>
<p>On what condition stands it and wherein? 632</p>
<p>YORK Even in condition 633 of the worst degree,</p>
<p>In gross rebellion and detested treason.</p>
<p>Thou art a banished man, and here art come</p>
<p>Before th’expiration of thy time,</p>
<p>In braving 634 arms against thy sovereign.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK As I was banished, I was banished Hereford,</p>
<p>Stands</p>
<p>But as I come, I come for 635 Lancaster.</p>
<p>And noble uncle, I beseech your grace</p>
<p>Look on my wrongs with an indifferent 636 eye.</p>
<p>You are my father, for methinks in you</p>
<p>I see old Gaunt alive. O then, my father,</p>
<p>Will you permit that I shall stand condemned</p>
<p>A wand’ring vagabond; my rights and royalties</p>
<p>Plucked from my arms perforce 637 and given away</p>
<p>To upstart unthrifts 638 ? Wherefore was I born?</p>
<p>If that my cousin king be King of England,</p>
<p>It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.</p>
<p>You have a son, Aumerle, my noble kinsman:</p>
<p>Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,</p>
<p>He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father</p>
<p>To rouse 639 his wrongs and chase them to the bay 640 .</p>
<p>I am denied to sue my liv’ry 641 here,</p>
<p>And yet my letters patents 642 give me leave.</p>
<p>My father’s goods are all distrained 643 and sold,</p>
<p>And these and all are all amiss 644 employed.</p>
<p>What would you have me do? I am a subject,</p>
<p>And challenge law 645 . Attorneys are denied me;</p>
<p>And therefore personally I lay my claim</p>
<p>To my inheritance of free descent 646 .</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND The noble duke hath been too much abused.</p>
<p>ROSS It stands your grace upon 647 to do him right.</p>
<p>WILLOUGHBY Base men by his endowments 648 are made great.</p>
<p>YORK My lords of England, let me tell you this:</p>
<p>I have had feeling of my cousin’s wrongs</p>
<p>And laboured all I could to do him right.</p>
<p>But in this kind 649 to come, in braving arms,</p>
<p>Be his own carver and cut out his way 650 ,</p>
<p>To find out right with wrongs, it may not be,</p>
<p>And you that do abet him in this kind</p>
<p>Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND The noble duke hath sworn his coming is</p>
<p>But for his own; and for the right of that</p>
<p>We all have strongly sworn to give him aid.</p>
<p>And let him ne’er see joy that breaks that oath!</p>
<p>YORK Well, well, I see the issue 651 of these arms.</p>
<p>I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,</p>
<p>Because my power 652 is weak and all ill left 653 .</p>
<p>But if I could, by him that gave me life,</p>
<p>I would attach 654 you all and make you stoop 655</p>
<p>Unto the sovereign mercy of the king.</p>
<p>But since I cannot, be it known to you</p>
<p>I do remain as neuter 656 . So, fare you well,</p>
<p>Unless you please to enter in the castle</p>
<p>And there repose you for this night.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK An offer, uncle, that we will accept.</p>
<p>But we must win 657 your grace to go with us</p>
<p>To Bristol Castle, which they say is held</p>
<p>By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,</p>
<p>The caterpillars 658 of the commonwealth,</p>
<p>Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.</p>
<p>YORK It may be I will go with you: but yet I’ll pause,</p>
<p>For I am loath to break our country’s laws.</p>
<p>Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:</p>
<p>Things past redress are now with me past care.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
