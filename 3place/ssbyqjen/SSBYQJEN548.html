<h4 id="introduction-to">Introduction to</h4>
<p>The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice</p>
<p>For Shakespeare’s original audience, ‘the Moor of Venice’ would have
instantly suggested a meeting of the familiar and the strange, of east
and west. ‘Venice’ was synonymous with European sophistication, ‘Moor’
with the atmosphere of the Orient, of North Africa and the Middle East.
Yet the short Italian novel on which the play is based makes little of
the Moor’s status as an outsider. Written by Giraldi Cinthio, it was one
of a series of exemplary stories concerning marital infidelity. Its
purpose was to show how ‘it sometimes happens that without any fault at
all, a faithful and loving lady, through the insidious plots of a
villainous mind, and the frailty of one who believes more than he need,
is murdered by her faithful husband’. In Venice, a Moor, dear to the
senate because he has served the interests of the republic in battle,
marries a virtuous lady called Disdemona. The Venetian lords decide to
change the guard in Cyprus and the Moor is chosen as commandant.
Disdemona insists on going with him; they arrive safely in Cyprus (no
storm, no Turks). The Moor’s ensign or standard-bearer falls in love
with Disdemona, who does not reciprocate. The ensign assumes that this
is because she is in love with his superior, the corporal. His love for
Disdemona turns to hate and he decides that if he cannot have her, nor
should the Moor. He accordingly plots to make the Moor jealous of the
corporal, thus destroying them both.</p>
<p>Venice was notorious for the number and openness of its courtesans,
and the laxness of its wives. It was the pleasure capital of Europe, a
city of sexual tourism. Cinthio’s Disdemona, however, is ‘impelled not
by female appetite but by the Moor’s good qualities’: she is an atypical
Venetian woman. Shakespeare intends his Desdemona to be regarded in the
same way, even as the men in the play exploit the stereotypical image of
Venetian women. Iago pumps up Rodorigo’s desire on the quayside with
talk of female lechery and he plays on Othello’s fear that his wife
might revert to type, reminding the Moor that Venetian women are
habitual sexual deceivers:</p>
<p>I know our country disposition well:</p>
<p>In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks</p>
<p>They dare not show their husbands: their best conscience</p>
<p>Is not to leave’t undone, but kept unknown.</p>
<p>Visiting Venice in the 1590s, Sir Henry Wotton remarked on the
difficulty of distinguishing between whores and virtuous wives on the
streets – the presence in the play of Bianca the courtesan is telling
here. In the overhearing scene, Othello fails to make exactly this
distinction as to which woman, wife or courtesan, Iago and Cassio are
talking about. Iago’s seemingly casual references to Desdemona’s
‘appetite’ and ‘will’, his view of Venetian women as sexual beasts, soon
cause Othello to be convinced that his wife’s hand is hot and moist,
traditional signs of sexual licence. The division between wife and whore
is horribly dissolved in the fourth act, where home is turned into
brothel, and Desdemona twice called strumpet and thrice whore,
culminating in the savage lines ‘I took you for that cunning whore of
Venice / That married with Othello.’ Only when he has killed her does
Othello rediscover the true coldness of her chastity – though in
speaking of Desdemona thus, we should not regard her as the icy maiden
of Petrarchan poetic tradition, for in the scene before Othello’s
arrival in Cyprus she proves herself adept in feisty and sexually
knowing banter with her male interlocutors.</p>
<p>Othello is ill at ease with the language of double entendre because
he is an ‘extravagant and wheeling stranger’ who works within a very
different poetic register. His verbal sphere is rich in allusion to an
exotic other world filled with Arabian trees and turbaned Turks in
Aleppo, not to mention ‘The Anthropophagi and men whose heads / Grew
beneath their shoulders.’ ‘Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
/ Against the general enemy Ottoman’, says the Duke of Venice early in
the play. The audience hears a consonance between the names of the
captain-general ‘Othello’ and the general enemy ‘Ottoman’. This would
have been especially apparent if, as is likely, the original
pronunciation of the hero’s name was Italianized as ‘Otello’. Othman was
the name of the founder of the mighty Ottoman or Turkish Empire, the
great rival civilization to Christianity. Othello’s name suggests his
origin in the Ottoman territories, against which he is now fighting. The
clash of Christian against Turk was one of Shakespeare’s major additions
to his source.</p>
<p>To Shakespeare and his contemporaries, Turk, Arab and Moor all
represented the Islamic ‘other’, but they were not necessarily
homogenized into a single image of generic ‘barbarianism’. Arabic
culture was frequently associated with learning and civilization, in
contrast to the prevailing images of Turk and Saracen. A Barbar could be
‘brave’ rather than ‘barbarous’: George Peele’s Battle of Alcazar in
Barbary , a play based on real recent historical events, has both ‘a
barbarous Moor, / The negro Muly Hamet’ and a ‘brave Barbarian Lord Muly
Molocco’. A Moor could help you out in your war against the Turk – or,
for that matter, the Spaniard. How you judged the Islamic ‘other’
depended not only on ideological stereotype but also on the
particularities of diplomatic liaison and changing allegiance in a world
of superpower rivalry. At the end of Alcazar , the evil Moor Muly
Mahamet is defeated. The throne of Barbary goes to Abdelmelec’s virtuous
brother, who is also called Muly Mahamet and who was a real historical
figure. His ambassador Abd-el-Oahed ben Massaood visited the Elizabethan
court in 1600 in order to explore the possibility of forming an alliance
to conquer Spain with a mixture of the English navy and African troops.
Shakespeare’s company played at court that Christmas, so he may have
seen the Barbarian delegation in the flesh. The surviving portrait of
the ambassador is perhaps the best image we have of what Shakespeare
intended Othello to look like.</p>
<p>Peele’s play mingled historical matter with a more general sense of
the barbarian, the other, the devilish – bad Muly Mahamet surrounds
himself with demonic and underworld associations. Audiences would have
come to The Moor of Venice with the expectation of something similar,
but witnessed a remarkable inversion whereby a sophisticated Venetian is
the one who comes to be associated with the devil and damnable
actions.</p>
<p>The primary usage of the term ‘Moor’ in early modern English was as a
religious, not a racial, identification: Moor meant ‘Mohamedan’, that is
to say Muslim. The word was frequently used as a general term for ‘not
one of us’, non-Christian. To the play’s original audience, one of the
most striking things about the figure of Othello would have been that he
is a committed Christian. The ground of the play is laid out in the
first scene, when Iago trumpets his own military virtues, in contrast to
Cassio’s ‘theoretical’ knowledge of the art of war (Cassio comes from
Florence, home of such experts in the theory of war as Machiavelli):</p>
<p>And I – of whom his eyes had seen the proof</p>
<p>At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on others’ grounds,</p>
<p>Christened and heathen …</p>
<p>These lines give an immediate sense of confrontation between
Christian and heathen dominions, with Rhodes and Cyprus as pressure
points. Startlingly, though, the Moor is fighting for the Christians,
not the heathens.</p>
<p>Again, consider Othello’s response to the drunken brawl in
Cyprus:</p>
<p>Are we turned Turks, and to ourselves do that</p>
<p>Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?</p>
<p>For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl!</p>
<p>Such Christian language in the mouth of a Moor, a Muslim, is
inherently a paradox. It suggests that Othello would have been assumed
to be a convert. The ‘baptism’ that Iago says he will cause Othello to
renounce would have taken place not at birth but at conversion. The
action of the play re-converts Othello from Christianity, through the
machinations of Iago. In this sense, it is fitting that Iago appeals to
a ‘Divinity of hell’ and that Othello acknowledges at the end of the
play that he is bound for damnation.</p>
<p>The notion of conversion was crucial in the Elizabethan perception of
the relationship between European Christianity and the Ottoman Empire.
The phrase to ‘turn Turk’ entered the common lexicon. Islam was as
powerful an alien force to Europeans in the sixteenth century as
Communism was to Americans in the twentieth. To turn Turk was to go over
to the other side. It could happen in a number of different ways: some
travellers converted by a process of cultural assimilation, others who
had been captured and enslaved did so in the belief that they would then
be released. It is easy to forget how many English privateers became
Ottoman slaves – on one occasion, two thousand wives petitioned King
James and parliament for help in ransoming their husbands from Muslim
captivity.</p>
<p>Othello dies on a kiss, an embrace of black and white, perhaps a
symbolic reconciliation of the virtues of west and east, Europe and
Orient, but the public image he wants to be remembered by in the letter
back to Venice is of confrontation between Christian and Turk, with
himself as the defender of Christianity in Aleppo, a point of eastern
extremity in Syria. In smiting himself, Othello recognizes that he has
now become the Turk. By killing Desdemona he has renounced his Christian
civility and damned himself. He symbolically takes back upon himself the
insignia of Islam – turban, circumcision – that he had renounced when he
turned Christian. He has beaten a Venetian wife and traduced the state.
He has been turned Turk. Not, however, by the general Ottoman but by the
‘supersubtle’ Venetian, the ‘honest’ Iago.</p>
<p>As Shakespeare adds the Turkish context to the story that was his
source, so he takes away the simple motivation of being in love with
Disdemona that Cinthio gave the ensign. Iago has sometimes been
considered motiveless, utterly devilish. It was a convention of
Renaissance drama that what a character says in soliloquy is to be
believed, yet it is barely possible to credit Iago’s paranoid claim that
both Othello and Cassio have been in his bed. Emilia is one of
Shakespeare’s strongest-minded female characters: she robustly condemns
the sexual double standard whereby men are allowed their extramarital
affairs and women are not. One cannot rule out the possibility that she
has been unfaithful to Iago (Gregory Doran’s Royal Shakespeare Company
production hinted at an affair with Lodovico), but the idea of Othello
making love to her is absurd.</p>
<p>Jealousy over the matter of promotion is sufficient explanation for
the first part of Iago’s plot, whereby Cassio’s weakness for the bottle
leads to his being cashiered. But why does Iago then go so much further,
utterly destroying the general on whose patronage he depends? Othello
asks the question at the end of the play: ‘Will you, I pray, demand that
demi-devil / Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?’ But Iago
refuses to answer: ‘Demand me nothing: what you know, you know: / From
this time forth I never will speak word.’ It sounds like a deliberate
challenge to the audience to work it out for themselves. No one has
risen to that challenge better than the Romantic critic, William
Hazlitt, who regarded the love of play-acting as the key to Iago’s
procedure:</p>
<p>He is an amateur of tragedy in real life; and instead of employing
his invention on imaginary characters, or long-forgotten incidents, he
takes the bolder and more desperate course of getting up his plot at
home, casts the principal parts among his nearest friends and
connections, and rehearses it in downright earnest, with steady nerves
and unabated resolution.</p>
<p>Exactly because he is scriptwriter, director and stage-villain rolled
into one, Iago is a compelling presence in the theatre. And he is given
the largest part. It would have been easy for him to dwarf the other
characters, as Edmund can dwarf Edgar in King Lear . Shakespeare’s
challenge was to make Othello rise far above Iago’s other dupe,
Rodorigo. To be reduced to a gibbering idiot over the matter of a
misplaced handkerchief is to be duped indeed. But the mesmerizing effect
of the poetic writing is such that we never think of Othello as foolish
or laughable, not even in the temptation scene of the third act in which
Iago twists every word, every detail, to the advantage of his plot.
Instead, we turn the Moor’s own phrase back on to him: ‘But yet the pity
of it, Iago! O, Iago, the pity of it, Iago!’</p>
<p>Desdemona inspires our pity not because she is pitiful, but because
her courage in going against her father’s will, in following her husband
to the far frontier of the Venetian empire in Cyprus, and in generously
speaking out for Cassio, becomes the cause of her death. Othello
inspires our pity because he also inspires our awe, above all through
his soaring language. For the Renaissance, the twin powers of rational
thought and persuasive language, oratio and ratio , were what raised
humankind above the level of the beasts. The tragedy of Othello is that
Iago’s persuasive but specious reasoning (you’re black, you’re getting
on in years, Venetian women are notoriously fickle … ) transforms
Othello from great orator (‘Rude am I in my speech’, he says with deftly
rhetorical modesty as he proceeds to bewitch his listeners with an
anything-but-rude narrative ‘Of moving accidents by flood and field, /
Of hair-breadth scapes i’th ’imminent deadly breach’) to savage beast.
And yet in the dignity of his two last speeches, first poised and
public, then tender and intimate, there is a linguistic fortitude that
turns Othello back into something human, something magnificent.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Othello the Moor, a general employed by the Venetian state, has
secretly married Desdemona, a daughter of the senator Brabantio. Iago,
an ensign nursing resentment against Othello, enlists the help of
Rodorigo, a disappointed suitor of Desdemona. They wake Brabantio in the
middle of the night with the news of his daughter’s elopement. Brabantio
takes the case to the senate where, learning that she has married
Othello of her own accord, he disowns his daughter. Othello is
immediately ordered to the Venetian colony of Cyprus to repel a
threatened Turkish invasion. Desdemona sails with her husband, taking
with them her companion Emilia, who is also Iago’s wife, and Othello’s
lieutenant Michael Cassio, newly promoted over Iago’s head. Once in
Cyprus, Iago plants the suspicion in Othello’s mind that Desdemona has
been unfaithful to him with Cassio. He engineers a drunken brawl for
which Cassio is blamed and dismissed by Othello. Desdemona intercedes on
Cassio’s behalf but her constant pleas to Othello for his reinstatement
only serve to convince Othello that Cassio is her lover. Iago acquires a
treasured handkerchief that belonged to Desdemona and uses it as ‘proof’
of the affair. Increasingly maddened by jealousy, Othello orders Iago to
kill Cassio and strangles Desdemona himself. Emilia discloses her
husband’s plot and Othello, tormented by grief and remorse, kills
himself. Iago, after murdering his own wife, is left to the justice of
the Venetian state.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Iago (31%/272/12), Othello (25%/274/12), Desdemona (11%/165/9),
Cassio (8%/110/9), Emilia (7%/103/8), Brabantio (4%/30/3), Rodorigo
(3%/59/7), Lodovico (2%/33/4), Duke of Venice (2%/25/1), Montano
(2%/24/3).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 80% verse, 20% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: 1604. Performed at court, November 1604; apparently uses
Knolles’ Historie of the Turkes , published late 1603; probably
post-dates the period when theatres were closed due to the plague from
May 1603 to April 1604. The Turkish wars in the eastern Mediterranean
were of interest to King James, who had written a poem about the 1571
naval battle of Lepanto, which was reprinted in 1603, the year of his
accession to the English throne. Some scholars, however, argue for a
slightly earlier date.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Based on a novella in Giovanni Battista Giraldi Cinthio’s
Gli Hecatommithi (1565), perhaps read in a 1584 French translation by
Gabriel Chappuys. Context probably provided by Richard Knolles, The
Generall Historie of the Turkes (1603), Sir Lewis Lewkenor’s translation
of Gasparo Contarini’s The Commonwealth and Government of Venice (1599)
and John Pory’s translation of Leo Africanus’ Geographical Historie of
Africa (1600).</p>
<p>TEXT: There are two early texts, markedly different from each other:
a Quarto published in 1622 and the First Folio of 1623. The Folio
contains over 150 lines that are not in the Quarto. The Quarto has
fuller stage directions, a handful of lines that are absent from the
Folio, and a large number of oaths that were watered down or omitted in
the Folio, as a result of the prohibition on stage swearing. In all,
there are about a thousand verbal variants. The two texts seem to derive
from different theatrical manuscripts, the Folio possibly having being
set from a transcript by Ralph Crane, scribe to the King’s Men. Scholars
are divided as to whether the Folio-only passages, which include
Othello’s ‘Pontic sea’ speech and Desdemona’s willow song, are
theatrically purposeful additions or theatrically pragmatic cuts. We
respect the integrity of the Folio text, but in correcting its manifest
errors – which are many, largely due to the presence of ‘Compositor E’,
the apprentice who was the poorest of the Folio’s typesetters – we have
been greatly helped by the existence of the Quarto.</p>
