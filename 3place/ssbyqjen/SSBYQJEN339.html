<h4 id="introduction-to">Introduction to</h4>
<p>The Tragedy of Coriolanus</p>
<p>Where did Shakespeare learn the Roman history that he so memorably
dramatized in Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus? Minor
variants and improvisations apart, the answer is simple. While most of
his plays involved him in the cutting and pasting of a whole range of
literary and theatrical sources, in the Roman tragedies he kept his eye
focused on the pages of a single great book.</p>
<p>That book was Plutarch’s Lives of the Most Noble Grecians and Romanes
. Plutarch was a Greek, born in Boeotia in the first century AD. His
book included forty-six biographies of the great figures of ancient
history, arranged in pairs, half Greek and half Roman, with a brief
‘comparison’between each pair. The purpose of the ’parallel’ was to ask
such questions as ‘Who was the greater general, the Greek Alexander or
the Roman Julius Caesar?’ Shakespeare affectionately mocks the device of
parallelism in Henry the Fifth , when Fluellen argues that Harry of
Monmouth is like Alexander of Macedon because their respective
birthplaces begin with an ‘M’ and there’s a river in each and ‘there is
salmons in both’. But the comedy here is at Fluellen’s expense, not
Plutarch’s –and, like all Shakespeare’s richest jokes, it has a serious
point. As Alexander the Great killed his bosom-friend Cleitus in a
drunken brawl, so King Harry in all sobriety caused his old chum
Falstaff to die of a broken heart.</p>
<p>For Shakespeare, the historical parallel was a device of great power.
The censorship of the stage exercised by court officialdom meant that it
was exceedingly risky to dramatize contemporary affairs, so the best way
of writing political drama was to take subjects from the past and leave
it to the audience to see the parallel in the present. The uncertainty
over the succession to the Virgin Queen meant that there were frequent
whispers of conspiracy in the final years of Elizabeth’s reign. It would
hardly have been appropriate to write a play about a group of highly
placed courtiers (the Earl of Essex and his circle, say) plotting to
overthrow the monarchy. But a play about a group of highly placed Roman
patricians (Brutus, Cassius and company) plotting to assassinate Julius
Caesar had the capacity to raise some awkward questions by means of the
implicit parallel.</p>
<p>Plutarch’s greatest importance for Shakespeare was his way of writing
history through biography. He taught the playwright that the little
human touch often says more than the large impersonal historical force.
Plutarch explained his method in the ‘Life of Alexander’: ‘My intent is
not to write histories, but only lives. For the noblest deeds do not
always show men’s virtues and vices; but oftentimes a light occasion, a
word, or some sport, makes men’s natural dispositions and manners appear
more plain than the famous battles won wherein are slain ten thousand
men, or the great armies, or cities won by siege or assault.’ So too in
Shakespeare’s Roman plays. It is the particular occasion – the single
word, the moment of tenderness or jest – that humanizes the superpower
politicians: Brutus and Cassius making up after their quarrel, the
defeated Cleopatra remembering it is her birthday, Caius Martius
exhausted from battle forgetting the name of the man who helped him in
Corioles.</p>
<p>In his ‘Life of Caius Martius Coriolanus’ Plutarch gives a brief
character-sketch of the Roman general who, by virtue of his heroic
endeavour behind the closed gates of Corioles, gained the surname
Coriolanus: ‘For this Martius’ natural wit and great heart did
marvellously stir up his courage to do and attempt noble acts. But on
the other side, for lack of education he was so choleric and impatient
that he would yield to no living creature, which made him churlish,
uncivil, and altogether unfit for any man’s conversation.’ As the name
‘Martius’ suggests, Coriolanus has all the martial virtues. His tragedy
is that he has none of the civil ones. He devotes himself wholly to the
code of valour (Latin virtus ). Where Mark Antony is led astray from
Roman values by his lover Cleopatra, Coriolanus is trained up in virtus
by his mother Volumnia. He has a suitably austere Roman wife, who
usually appears in company with a chaste companion (Valeria, the very
opposite of Cleopatra’s companion Charmian). And when his son Young
Martius, a chip off the old block, is praised for tearing the wings off
a butterfly with his teeth, we gain a glimpse into the kind of
upbringing that Coriolanus may be imagined to have had. ‘Anger’s my
meat’, says Volumnia: perhaps in compensation for the premature
disappearance of her husband, she has bred up an angry young man, ready
to serve Rome on the battlefield where one senses she wishes she could
go herself – as she does at the end of the play. If Antony and Cleopatra
is about the tragic consequences of the dissolution of Romanness,
Coriolanus is about the equally tragic result of an unyielding adherence
to it. ‘It is held’, says Cominius,</p>
<p>That valour is the chiefest virtue, and</p>
<p>Most dignifies the haver: if it be,</p>
<p>The man I speak of cannot in the world</p>
<p>Be singly counterpoised …</p>
<p>‘If it be’: Coriolanus’ own mode of speaking, by contrast, is what he
calls the ‘absolute “shall“’. To leave room for an ‘if’ would be to call
his whole world-picture into question.</p>
<p>The play brings the absolute embodiment of virtus into hostile
dialogue with other voices. As in Julius Caesar , the action begins not
with the hero but with the people, to whom Plutarch (a believer in the
theory that history is shaped by the deeds of great men alone) never
gives a voice. In the very early period of the Roman republic, around
the fifth century before Christ, Rome faced two threats: an external
danger from neighbouring territories (the Volscians, based in Antium and
Corioles) and the internal danger of division between the patricians and
the plebeians. The martial hero is supremely successful in dealing with
the external threat through force, but his attempt to handle internal
affairs in the same way leads to his banishment and eventual death. The
opening scene reveals that the people do have a case: the first citizen
argues cogently against inequality, speaking ‘in hunger for bread, not
in thirst for revenge’. Diplomacy is the skill needed here; Coriolanus,
who is always ‘himself alone’ and who trusts in the deeds of the sword
rather than the blandishments of the word, will have no truck with
compromise. His pride and his desire to stand alone are only allayed
when he faces his mother, wife and son pleading for him to have mercy on
the city. Volumnia appeals to the bond of family; after her eloquent
entreaty, Coriolanus hovers for a moment in one of the most powerful
silences in Shakespeare. He sets aside his code of manly strength,
accepts the familial tie, and in so doing effectively signs his own
death warrant. He has for the first time fully recognized the claims of
other people, escaped the bond of absolute self. The knowledge of what
he has done brings a kind of peace: ‘But let it come’, he says of his
inevitable end. He is speaking here in the voice of Stoic
resignation.</p>
<p>The nineteenth-century critic William Hazlitt said that anyone who
was familiar with Coriolanus could save themselves the trouble of
reading Edmund Burke’s attack on the French Revolution and Tom Paine’s
defence of it, because Shakespeare gives you both sides of the question.
The play anatomizes the strengths and the weaknesses of both absolutism
and republicanism, interrogates both the principle of aristocracy and
that of democracy. The plebeians and their elected representatives, the
tribunes, have arguments as good as those of the patricians who, at the
beginning of the play, have been hoarding grain for no good reason.</p>
<p>But ultimately, Hazlitt contended, Shakespeare had a leaning towards
the side of arbitrary power, that of Coriolanus himself. Perhaps in
contempt of his own lowly origins, or out of politic fear of the
consequences of ‘confusion’ in the state, Shakespeare gives charisma to
aristocratic swagger. Stage directions such as ‘Citizens steal away’ and
‘Enter a rabble of plebeians’ suggest where authorial sympathies do not
lie. ‘The language of poetry’, Hazlitt said, ‘naturally falls in with
the language of power.’ All the memorable poetry belongs to Coriolanus,
none to the tribunes. Whatever the force of the arguments on either
side, the audience is swept away by the energy of the play’s warrior
hero. In particular, there is something irresistible about his solitary
intensity.’Alone I did it’, he vaunts, remembering the deed that gave
him his name: the conquest of Corioles, achieved when the plebeian
soldiers ran away and the gates of the enemy city clanged shut behind
him. In its way, his arrogance is as magnificent as his courage. Accused
of being an enemy to the people, he is banished from the city for which
he has been prepared to lay down his life on the battlefield. His reply
turns the sentence on its head:</p>
<p>You common cry of curs, whose breath I hate</p>
<p>As reek o’th’rotten fens: whose loves I prize</p>
<p>As the dead carcasses of unburied men</p>
<p>That do corrupt my air: I banish you,</p>
<p>And here remain with your uncertainty.</p>
<p>The brilliance of the writing is in the detail: not only the glorious
turn in the verb from passive’banished’ to active ‘I banish you’, but
also the first person pronoun ‘my’ applied to the very ‘air’, thus
showing how Coriolanus’ world revolves around himself, and the riposte
‘here [may you] remain with your uncertainty’, which reveals the gulf
between the solitary martial hero’s firmness of vision and the messy
vicissitudes of communal life.</p>
<p>Coriolanus walks proudly away from Rome, soon to face the humiliation
of being ordered around by mere servingmen. The very qualities that made
him a great warrior – his singleness of purpose and lack of compromise –
are those that make him a poor politician. The play is a tragedy because
the man of war cannot keep the peace. It is also a work of deep irony.
Coriolanus is the walking embodiment of masculinity. He feels a
peculiarly intense bond with Aufidius, his opponent on the battlefield.
The single erotic speech in the play is spoken by Aufidius when he
welcomes the exiled Coriolanus to his home, an arrival that excites him
more than his wife crossing his threshold on their wedding night. His
nightly dream has been to wrestle with Coriolanus’ body in hand-to-hand
combat:</p>
<p>We have been down together in my sleep,</p>
<p>Unbuckling helms, fisting each other’s throat,</p>
<p>And waked half dead with nothing …</p>
<p>Though Coriolanus does not respond to this extraordinary advance in
verbal kind, he is manifestly a man who is at his most fulfilled when
among other men. And yet the march of this supremely manly man comes to
an abrupt halt in the face of his mother, Volumnia. ‘The ladies have
prevailed’: by a lovely irony, Rome is saved by the words of an old
woman, not the deeds of a young man. No wonder Caius Martius is so angry
when Aufidius calls him ‘boy’: Coriolanus is Peter Pan in full body
armour, a boy who refuses to grow up.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Famine in Rome is kindling unrest between the common people and
the patricians. The people particularly resent the arrogant Caius
Martius, son of Volumnia, who makes no secret of the fact that he
despises them. The citizens rise up against the patricians, whom they
suspect of hoarding corn for themselves. They are rewarded with the
creation of two people’s representatives, or tribunes, who are given new
powers to sit in the Senate. War with the neighbouring Volscians halts
the rioting, however, and, in the battle for the town of Corioli, Caius
Martius leads the Roman army with such spectacular bravery that he is
honoured with the title ‘Coriolanus’. Back in Rome, the patricians urge
Coriolanus to seek the consulship. Reluctantly, he agrees to submit
himself to the necessary public display of humility in order to win the
assent of the citizens, but once again his inability to mask his
contempt turns them against him. Not only do they refuse their assent
but, incited by their tribunes, they banish Coriolanus from Rome. In
revenge, he joins the Volscians and his former enemy Tullus Aufidius.
Together they march on Rome. Coriolanus refuses all attempts at
conciliation by his former comrades and only through the intercession of
his mother, wife and son is he finally persuaded to spare the city. He
establishes a peace, but is killed by the resentful Volscians.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Caius Martius/Coriolanus (23%/189/18), Menenius Agrippa
(15%/162/13), Volumnia (8%/57/6), Sicinius Velutus (8%/117/10), Cominius
(8%/67/11), Tullus Aufidius (7%/45/8), Junius Brutus (7%/91/9), Titus
Lartius (2%/23/6), First Citizen (2%/33/4), Third Servingman (1%/20/1),
Third Citizen (1%/18/3), Valeria (1%/14/2).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 80% verse, 20% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: 1608? Probably uses Camden’s Remaines (1605); a phrase is
parodied in Ben Jonson’s Epicoene (late 1609). Allusion to ‘coal of fire
upon the ice’ in Act 1 scene 1 sometimes taken to refer to the great
frost of winter 1607/08, when the Thames was frozen and people with
‘pans of coals to warm your fingers’ were stationed on the middle of the
river; the issue of grain shortage and hoarding with which the action
begins has been related to an insurrection in the English midlands in
1607–08. Theatres were closed because of the plague for the majority of
the time in these years, so the play may belong to the open period of
April–July 1608.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Closely based on ‘The Life of Caius Martius Coriolanus’ in
Sir Thomas North’s English translation of Plutarch’s Lives of the Most
Noble Grecians and Romanes (Shakespeare probably used the 1595 edition).
Menenius’ fable of the belly in the first scene is the only occasion on
which an additional source seems to have been used: the wording suggests
the influence of both Livy’s Romane Historie (trans. Philemon Holland,
1600) and William Camden’s Remaines of a greater worke concerning
Britaine (1605).</p>
<p>TEXT: 1623 Folio, apparently set from Shakespeare’s manuscript or a
scribal transcript of it, is the only early edition; irregular lineation
is the main problem in the printing.</p>
