continues</h4>
<p>Enter Leontes, Hermione, Mamillius, Polixenes, Camillo [and
Attendants ]</p>
<p>POLIXENES Nine changes of the wat’ry star 28 hath been</p>
<p>The shepherd’s note 29 since we have left our throne</p>
<p>Without a burden 30 . Time as long again</p>
<p>Would be filled up, my brother, with our thanks.</p>
<p>And yet we should, for perpetuity 31 ,</p>
<p>Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher 32 ,</p>
<p>Yet standing in rich place, I multiply</p>
<p>With one ‘We thank you’ many thousands moe</p>
<p>That go before it.</p>
<p>LEONTES Stay 33 your thanks a while,</p>
<p>And pay them when you part.</p>
<p>POLIXENES Sir, that’s tomorrow.</p>
<p>I am questioned by my fears of what may chance</p>
<p>Or breed upon our absence, that may blow</p>
<p>No sneaping winds at home, to make us say</p>
<p>‘This is put forth too truly’ 34 . Besides, I have stayed</p>
<p>To tire your royalty.</p>
<p>LEONTES We are tougher, brother,</p>
<p>Than you can put us to’t 35 .</p>
<p>POLIXENES No longer stay.</p>
<p>LEONTES One sev’nnight 36 longer.</p>
<p>POLIXENES Very sooth 37 , tomorrow.</p>
<p>LEONTES We’ll part the time between’s 38 then, and in that</p>
<p>I’ll no gainsaying 39 .</p>
<p>POLIXENES Press me not, beseech you, so.</p>
<p>There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’th’world</p>
<p>So soon as yours could win me. So it should now,</p>
<p>Were there necessity in your request, although</p>
<p>’Twere needful 40 I denied it. My affairs</p>
<p>Do even drag me homeward, which to hinder</p>
<p>Were in your love a whip to me 41 , my stay</p>
<p>To you a charge 42 and trouble. To save both,</p>
<p>Farewell, our brother.</p>
<p>LEONTES Tongue-tied, our queen? Speak you.</p>
<p>HERMIONE I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until</p>
<p>You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,</p>
<p>Charge 43 him too coldly. Tell him you are sure</p>
<p>All in Bohemia’s well: this satisfaction</p>
<p>The bygone day 44 proclaimed. Say 45 this to him,</p>
<p>He’s beat from his best ward 46 .</p>
<p>LEONTES Well said, Hermione.</p>
<p>HERMIONE To tell 47 , he longs to see his son, were strong 48 .</p>
<p>But 49 let him say so then, and let him go.</p>
<p>But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,</p>
<p>We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs 50 .—</p>
<p>Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure 51</p>
<p>To Polixenes</p>
<p>The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia</p>
<p>You take 52 my lord, I’ll give him my commission</p>
<p>To let him there a month behind the gest</p>
<p>Prefixed for’s parting 53 .— Yet, good deed 54 , Leontes,</p>
<p>I love thee not a jar 55 o’th’clock behind</p>
<p>What lady she 56 her lord.— You’ll stay?</p>
<p>POLIXENES No, madam.</p>
<p>HERMIONE Nay, but you will?</p>
<p>POLIXENES I may not, verily.</p>
<p>HERMIONE Verily?</p>
<p>You put me off with limber vows 57 . But I,</p>
<p>Though you would seek t’unsphere the stars 58 with oaths,</p>
<p>Should yet say ‘Sir, no going.’ Verily,</p>
<p>You shall not go; a lady’s ‘Verily’ is</p>
<p>As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?</p>
<p>Force me to keep you as a prisoner,</p>
<p>Not like a guest: so you shall pay your fees</p>
<p>When you depart 59 , and save your thanks. How say you?</p>
<p>My prisoner? Or my guest? By your dread 60 ‘Verily’,</p>
<p>One of them you shall be.</p>
<p>POLIXENES Your guest, then, madam.</p>
<p>To be your prisoner should import offending 61 ,</p>
<p>Which is for me less easy to commit</p>
<p>Than you to punish.</p>
<p>HERMIONE Not your jailer, then,</p>
<p>But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you</p>
<p>Of 62 my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys.</p>
<p>You were pretty lordings 63 then?</p>
<p>POLIXENES We were, fair queen,</p>
<p>Two lads that thought there was no more behind 64</p>
<p>But such a day tomorrow as today,</p>
<p>And to be boy eternal.</p>
<p>HERMIONE Was not my lord</p>
<p>The verier wag 65 o’th’two?</p>
<p>POLIXENES We were as twinned lambs that did frisk i’th’sun,</p>
<p>And bleat the one at th’other. What we changed 66</p>
<p>Was innocence for innocence. We knew not</p>
<p>The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dreamed</p>
<p>That any did. Had we pursued that life,</p>
<p>And our weak spirits ne’er been higher reared</p>
<p>With stronger blood 67 , we should have answered heaven</p>
<p>Boldly ‘Not guilty’, the imposition cleared</p>
<p>Hereditary ours 68 .</p>
<p>HERMIONE By this we gather</p>
<p>You have tripped 69 since.</p>
<p>POLIXENES O, my most sacred lady,</p>
<p>Temptations have since then been born to’s 70 . For</p>
<p>In those unfledged 71 days was my wife a girl;</p>
<p>Your precious self had then not crossed the eyes</p>
<p>Of my young play-fellow 72 .</p>
<p>HERMIONE Grace to boot! 73</p>
<p>Of this make no conclusion 74 , lest you say</p>
<p>Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on.</p>
<p>Th’offences we have made you do we’ll answer 75 ,</p>
<p>If you first sinned with us, and that with us 76</p>
<p>You did continue fault, and that you slipped not</p>
<p>With any but with us.</p>
<p>LEONTES Is he won yet?</p>
<p>HERMIONE He’ll stay, my lord.</p>
<p>LEONTES At my request he would not.—</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st</p>
<p>To better purpose.</p>
<p>HERMIONE Never?</p>
<p>LEONTES Never, but once.</p>
<p>HERMIONE What? Have I twice said well? When was’t before?</p>
<p>I prithee tell me. Cram’s 77 with praise, and make’s</p>
<p>As fat as tame things 78 . One good deed dying tongueless 79</p>
<p>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that 80 .</p>
<p>Our praises are our wages. You may ride’s 81</p>
<p>With one soft kiss a thousand furlong 82 s ere</p>
<p>With spur we heat an acre 83 . But to th’goal:</p>
<p>My last good deed was to entreat his stay:</p>
<p>What was my first? It has an elder sister 84 ,</p>
<p>Or I mistake you — O, would 85 her name were Grace 86 ! —</p>
<p>But once before I spoke to th’purpose: when?</p>
<p>Nay, let me have’t: I long.</p>
<p>LEONTES Why, that was when</p>
<p>Three crabbèd 87 months had soured themselves to death,</p>
<p>Ere I could make thee open thy white hand</p>
<p>And clap 88 thyself my love; then didst thou utter</p>
<p>‘I am yours for ever.’</p>
<p>HERMIONE ’Tis grace indeed.—</p>
<p>Why, lo 89 you now, I have spoke to th’purpose 90 twice:</p>
<p>To Polixenes?</p>
<p>The one forever earned a royal husband;</p>
<p>Th’other for some while a friend 91 .</p>
<p>Takes Polixenes’ hand</p>
<p>LEONTES Too hot, too hot!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods 92 .</p>
<p>I have tremor cordis 93 on me: my heart dances,</p>
<p>But not for joy, not joy. This entertainment 94</p>
<p>May a free 95 face put on, derive a liberty</p>
<p>From heartiness 96 , from bounty 97 , fertile bosom 98 ,</p>
<p>And well become the agent 99 . ’T 100 may, I grant.</p>
<p>But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers 101 , 102</p>
<p>As now they are, and making practised 103 smiles,</p>
<p>As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as ’twere</p>
<p>The mort 104 o’th’deer 105 — O, that is entertainment</p>
<p>My bosom likes not, nor my brows 106 .— Mamillius,</p>
<p>Art thou my boy?</p>
<p>MAMILLIUS Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p>LEONTES I’ fecks! 107</p>
<p>Why, that’s my bawcock 108 . What? Hast smutched 109 thy nose?—</p>
<p>They say it is a copy out of mine.— Come, captain,</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>We must be neat 110 ; not neat, but cleanly, captain.</p>
<p>And yet the steer 111 , the heifer and the calf</p>
<p>Are all called neat.— Still virginalling</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Upon his palm 112 ?— How now, you wanton 113 calf!</p>
<p>Art thou my calf?</p>
<p>MAMILLIUS Yes, if you will, my lord.</p>
<p>LEONTES Thou want’st 114 a rough pash 115 and the shoots 116 that I
have</p>
<p>To be full 117 like me.— Yet they say we are</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>Almost as like as eggs; women say so,</p>
<p>That will say anything. But were they false</p>
<p>As o’er-dyed blacks 118 , as wind, as waters 119 , false</p>
<p>As dice are to be wished by one that fixes</p>
<p>No bourn ’twixt his and mine 120 , yet were it true</p>
<p>To say this boy were like me.— Come, sir page,</p>
<p>To Mamillius</p>
<p>Look on me with your welkin 121 eye. Sweet villain!</p>
<p>Most dear’st, my collop 122 ! Can thy dam 123 , may’t be</p>
<p>Affection 124 ?— Thy intention 125 stabs the centre.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>Thou dost make possible things not so held 126 ,</p>
<p>Communicat’st with dreams — how can this be? —</p>
<p>With what’s unreal thou 127 coactive art,</p>
<p>And fellow’st 128 nothing. Then ’tis very credent 129 co-join 130</p>
<p>Thou mayst co-join with something, and thou dost,</p>
<p>And that beyond commission 131 , and I find 132 it,</p>
<p>And that to the infection of my brains</p>
<p>And hard’ning of my brows 133 .</p>
<p>POLIXENES What means Sicilia 134 ?</p>
<p>HERMIONE He something seems 135 unsettled.</p>
<p>POLIXENES How, my lord?</p>
<p>LEONTES What cheer? How is’t with you, best brother?</p>
<p>HERMIONE You look as if you held a brow of much distraction.</p>
<p>Are you moved 136 , my lord?</p>
<p>LEONTES No, in good earnest.—</p>
<p>How sometimes nature will betray its folly,</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime</p>
<p>To harder bosoms 137 !— Looking on the lines</p>
<p>Of my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil</p>
<p>Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreeched 138 ,</p>
<p>In my green velvet coat; my dagger muzzled 139 ,</p>
<p>Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,</p>
<p>As ornaments oft do, too dangerous.</p>
<p>How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,</p>
<p>This squash 140 , this gentleman.— Mine honest friend,</p>
<p>To Mamillius</p>
<p>Will you take eggs for money 141 ?</p>
<p>MAMILLIUS No, my lord, I’ll fight.</p>
<p>LEONTES You will? Why, happy man be’s dole 142 ! My brother,</p>
<p>Are you so fond of your young prince as we</p>
<p>Do seem to be of ours?</p>
<p>POLIXENES If at home, sir,</p>
<p>He’s all my exercise 143 , my mirth, my matter;</p>
<p>Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy;</p>
<p>My parasite 144 , my soldier, statesman, all.</p>
<p>He makes a July’s day short as December,</p>
<p>And with his varying childness 145 cures in me</p>
<p>Thoughts that would thick my blood 146 .</p>
<p>LEONTES So stands this squire</p>
<p>Officed 147 with me. We two will walk, my lord,</p>
<p>And leave you to your graver 148 steps.— Hermione,</p>
<p>How thou lovest us, show in our brother’s welcome.</p>
<p>Let what is dear 149 in Sicily be cheap 150 .</p>
<p>Next to thyself and my young rover 151 , he’s</p>
<p>Apparent 152 to my heart.</p>
<p>HERMIONE If you would seek us,</p>
<p>We are yours i’th’garden: shall’s attend 153 you there?</p>
<p>LEONTES To your own bents 154 dispose you: you’ll be found 155 ,</p>
<p>Be you beneath the sky.— I am angling now,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Though you perceive me not how I give line.</p>
<p>Go to 156 , go to!</p>
<p>How she holds up the neb, the bill 157 to him!</p>
<p>And arms her with the boldness of a wife</p>
<p>To her allowing husband 158 !</p>
<p>[Exeunt Polixenes, Hermione and Attendants ]</p>
<p>Gone already?</p>
<p>Inch-thick, knee-deep, o’er head and ears a forked 159 one!—</p>
<p>Go, play, boy, play. Thy mother plays 160 , and I</p>
<p>Play too, but so disgraced a part 161 , whose issue 162</p>
<p>Will hiss 163 me to my grave. Contempt and clamour</p>
<p>Will be my knell 164 . Go play, boy, play.— There have 165 been,</p>
<p>Or I am much deceived, cuckolds 166 ere now.</p>
<p>And many a man there is, even at this present,</p>
<p>Now while I speak this, holds his wife by th’arm,</p>
<p>That little thinks she has been sluiced 167 in’s absence</p>
<p>And his pond 168 fished 169 by his next neighbour, by</p>
<p>Sir Smile, his neighbour. Nay, there’s comfort in’t</p>
<p>Whiles other men have gates 170 and those gates opened,</p>
<p>As mine, against their will. Should all despair</p>
<p>That have revolted 171 wives, the tenth of mankind</p>
<p>Would hang themselves. Physic 172 for’t there’s none:</p>
<p>It is a bawdy 173 planet, that will strike 174</p>
<p>Where ’tis predominant 175 ; and ’tis powerful, think it,</p>
<p>From east, west, north and south. Be it concluded,</p>
<p>No barricado for a belly 176 . Know’t,</p>
<p>It will let in and out the enemy</p>
<p>With bag and baggage 177 . Many thousand on’s 178</p>
<p>Have the disease, and feel’t not.— How now, boy?</p>
<p>MAMILLIUS I am like you, they say.</p>
<p>LEONTES Why that’s some comfort. What, Camillo there?</p>
<p>CAMILLO Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>LEONTES Go play, Mamillius, thou’rt an honest man.—</p>
<p>[Exit Mamillius ]</p>
<p>Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.</p>
<p>CAMILLO You had much ado 179 to make his anchor hold 180 :</p>
<p>When you cast out, it still came home 181 .</p>
<p>LEONTES Didst note it?</p>
<p>CAMILLO He would not stay at your petitions 182 , made</p>
<p>His business more material 183 .</p>
<p>LEONTES Didst perceive it?—</p>
<p>They’re here with me already 184 , whisp’ring, rounding 185</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>‘Sicilia is a so-forth 186 .’ ’Tis far gone</p>
<p>When I shall gust 187 it last 188 .— How came’t, Camillo,</p>
<p>To Camillo</p>
<p>That he did stay?</p>
<p>CAMILLO At the good queen’s entreaty.</p>
<p>LEONTES At the queen’s be’t. ‘Good’ should be pertinent 189 ,</p>
<p>But so it is 190 , it is not. Was this taken 191</p>
<p>By any understanding pate 192 but thine?</p>
<p>For thy conceit is soaking 193 , will draw in</p>
<p>More than the common blocks 194 . Not noted, is’t,</p>
<p>But of 195 the finer natures? By some severals 196</p>
<p>Of head-piece 197 extraordinary? Lower messes 198</p>
<p>Perchance are to this business 199 purblind 200 ? Say.</p>
<p>CAMILLO Business, my lord? I think most understand</p>
<p>Bohemia stays here longer.</p>
<p>LEONTES Ha?</p>
<p>CAMILLO Stays here longer.</p>
<p>LEONTES Ay, but why?</p>
<p>CAMILLO To satisfy 201 your highness and the entreaties</p>
<p>Of our most gracious mistress.</p>
<p>LEONTES Satisfy?</p>
<p>Th’entreaties of your mistress? Satisfy?</p>
<p>Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,</p>
<p>With all the nearest things to my heart, as well 202</p>
<p>My chamber-councils 203 , wherein, priest-like, thou</p>
<p>Hast cleansed my bosom 204 , I from thee departed</p>
<p>Thy penitent reformed. But we 205 have been</p>
<p>Deceived in thy integrity, deceived</p>
<p>In that which seems so.</p>
<p>CAMILLO Be it forbid, my lord!</p>
<p>LEONTES To bide 206 upon’t, thou art not honest: or,</p>
<p>If thou inclin’st that way, thou art a coward,</p>
<p>Which hoxes 207 honesty behind, restraining</p>
<p>From course required: or else thou must be counted 208</p>
<p>A servant grafted 209 in my serious trust</p>
<p>And therein negligent: or else a fool</p>
<p>That see’st a game 210 played home 211 , the rich stake drawn 212
,</p>
<p>And tak’st it all for jest.</p>
<p>CAMILLO My gracious lord,</p>
<p>I may be negligent, foolish and fearful.</p>
<p>In every one of these no man is free,</p>
<p>But that his negligence, his folly, fear,</p>
<p>Among the infinite doings of the world,</p>
<p>Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,</p>
<p>If ever I were wilful-negligent 213 ,</p>
<p>It was my folly: if industriously</p>
<p>I played the fool, it was my negligence,</p>
<p>Not weighing 214 well the end: if ever fearful</p>
<p>To do a thing, where I the issue 215 doubted,</p>
<p>Whereof the execution did cry out</p>
<p>Against the non-performance 216 , ’twas a fear</p>
<p>Which oft infects the wisest. These, my lord,</p>
<p>Are such allowed infirmities that honesty</p>
<p>Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,</p>
<p>Be plainer with me. Let me know my trespass 217</p>
<p>By its own visage 218 ; if I then deny it,</p>
<p>’Tis none of mine.</p>
<p>LEONTES Ha’ not you seen, Camillo —</p>
<p>But that’s past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass 219</p>
<p>Is thicker than a cuckold’s horn — or heard —</p>
<p>For to a vision so apparent 220 rumour</p>
<p>Cannot be mute — or thought — for cogitation 221</p>
<p>Resides not in that man that does not think —</p>
<p>My wife is slippery 222 ? If thou wilt confess,</p>
<p>Or else be impudently negative,</p>
<p>To 223 have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say</p>
<p>My wife’s a hobby-horse 224 , deserves a name</p>
<p>As rank 225 as any flax-wench 226 that puts to</p>
<p>Before her troth-plight 227 : say’t and justify’t.</p>
<p>CAMILLO I would not be a stander-by to hear</p>
<p>My sovereign mistress clouded 228 so, without</p>
<p>My present 229 vengeance taken. ’Shrew 230 my heart,</p>
<p>You never spoke what did become 231 you less</p>
<p>Than this; which to reiterate were sin</p>
<p>As deep as that, though true 232 .</p>
<p>LEONTES Is whispering nothing?</p>
<p>Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?</p>
<p>Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career 233</p>
<p>Of laughter with a sigh — a note infallible 234</p>
<p>Of breaking honesty 235 ? Horsing foot on foot 236 ?</p>
<p>Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift?</p>
<p>Hours 237 , minutes? Noon, midnight? And all eyes</p>
<p>Blind with the pin and web 238 but theirs, theirs only,</p>
<p>That would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing 239 ?</p>
<p>Why then the world and all that’s in’t is nothing:</p>
<p>The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,</p>
<p>My wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings,</p>
<p>If this be nothing.</p>
<p>CAMILLO Good my lord, be cured</p>
<p>Of this diseased opinion, and betimes 240 .</p>
<p>For ’tis most dangerous.</p>
<p>LEONTES Say it be, ’tis true.</p>
<p>CAMILLO No, no, my lord.</p>
<p>LEONTES It is. You lie, you lie.</p>
<p>I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,</p>
<p>Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,</p>
<p>Or else a hovering temporizer 241 , that</p>
<p>Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,</p>
<p>Inclining to them both. Were my wife’s liver 242</p>
<p>Infected as her life, she would not live</p>
<p>The running of one glass 243 .</p>
<p>CAMILLO Who does infect her?</p>
<p>LEONTES Why, he that wears her like her medal 244 , hanging</p>
<p>About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I</p>
<p>Had servants true about me that bare 245 eyes</p>
<p>To see alike mine honour as their profits,</p>
<p>Their own particular thrifts 246 , they would do that</p>
<p>Which should undo 247 more doing 248 . Ay, and thou,</p>
<p>His cupbearer 249 — whom I from meaner form 250</p>
<p>Have benched 251 and reared to worship 252 , who mayst see</p>
<p>Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,</p>
<p>How I am galled 253 — mightst bespice 254 a cup</p>
<p>To give mine enemy a lasting wink 255 ,</p>
<p>Which draught to me were cordial 256 .</p>
<p>CAMILLO Sir, my lord,</p>
<p>I could do this, and that with no rash 257 potion,</p>
<p>But with a ling’ring dram 258 that should not work</p>
<p>Maliciously 259 like poison. But I cannot</p>
<p>Believe this crack 260 to be in my dread 261 mistress,</p>
<p>So sovereignly being honourable.</p>
<p>I have loved thee—</p>
<p>LEONTES Make that thy question, and go rot! 262</p>
<p>Dost think I am so muddy 263 , so unsettled,</p>
<p>To appoint myself in this vexation 264 , sully</p>
<p>The purity and whiteness of my sheets —</p>
<p>Which to preserve is sleep 265 , which being spotted 266</p>
<p>Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps —</p>
<p>Give scandal to the blood 267 o’th’prince my son —</p>
<p>Who I do think is mine and love as mine —</p>
<p>Without ripe moving to’t 268 ? Would I do this?</p>
<p>Could man so blench 269 ?</p>
<p>CAMILLO I must believe you, sir.</p>
<p>I do, and will fetch off 270 Bohemia for’t,</p>
<p>Provided that when he’s removed, your highness</p>
<p>Will take again your queen as yours at first,</p>
<p>Even for your son’s sake, and thereby for sealing</p>
<p>The injury of tongues 271 in courts and kingdoms</p>
<p>Known and allied to yours.</p>
<p>LEONTES Thou dost advise me</p>
<p>Even so as I mine own course have set down 272 .</p>
<p>I’ll give no blemish to her honour, none.</p>
<p>CAMILLO My lord,</p>
<p>Go then; and with a countenance 273 as clear</p>
<p>As friendship wears at feasts, keep 274 with Bohemia</p>
<p>And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:</p>
<p>If from me he have wholesome beverage,</p>
<p>Account me not your servant.</p>
<p>LEONTES This is all.</p>
<p>Do’t and thou hast the one half of my heart;</p>
<p>Do’t not, thou splitt’st thine own.</p>
<p>CAMILLO I’ll do’t, my lord.</p>
<p>LEONTES I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>CAMILLO O miserable 275 lady! But, for me,</p>
<p>What case 276 stand I in? I must be the poisoner</p>
<p>Of good Polixenes, and my ground 277 to do’t</p>
<p>Is the obedience to a master; one</p>
<p>Who, in rebellion with himself 278 , will have</p>
<p>All that are his so too 279 . To do this deed,</p>
<p>Promotion follows. If 280 I could find example</p>
<p>Of thousands that had struck anointed kings</p>
<p>And flourished after, I’d not do’t. But since</p>
<p>Nor brass nor stone nor parchment 281 bears not one,</p>
<p>Let villainy itself forswear’t. I must</p>
<p>Forsake the court. To do’t, or no, is certain</p>
<p>To me a break-neck 282 . Happy 283 star, reign now!</p>
<p>Here comes Bohemia.</p>
<p>Enter Polixenes</p>
<p>POLIXENES This is strange. Methinks</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>My favour here begins to warp 284 . Not speak?—</p>
<p>Good day, Camillo.</p>
<p>CAMILLO Hail, most royal sir!</p>
<p>POLIXENES What is the news i’th’court?</p>
<p>CAMILLO None rare 285 , my lord.</p>
<p>POLIXENES The king hath on him such a countenance</p>
<p>As 286 he had lost some province and a region</p>
<p>Loved as he loves himself. Even now I met him</p>
<p>With customary compliment 287 , when he,</p>
<p>Wafting his eyes to th’contrary 288 and falling 289</p>
<p>A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and</p>
<p>So leaves me to consider what is breeding</p>
<p>That changes thus his manners.</p>
<p>CAMILLO I dare not know, my lord.</p>
<p>POLIXENES How, dare not? Do not? Do you know, and dare not?</p>
<p>Be intelligent 290 to me. ’Tis thereabouts 291 .</p>
<p>For, to yourself, what you do know, you must 292 ,</p>
<p>And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,</p>
<p>Your changed complexions 293 are to me a mirror</p>
<p>Which shows me mine changed too, for I must be</p>
<p>A party in this alteration, finding</p>
<p>Myself thus altered with’t.</p>
<p>CAMILLO There is a sickness</p>
<p>Which puts some of us in distemper 294 , but</p>
<p>I cannot name the disease, and it is caught</p>
<p>Of 295 you that yet are well.</p>
<p>POLIXENES How, caught of me?</p>
<p>Make me not sighted like the basilisk 296 .</p>
<p>I have looked on thousands who have sped 297 the better</p>
<p>By my regard 298 , but killed none so. Camillo —</p>
<p>As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto</p>
<p>Clerk-like 299 experienced, which no less adorns</p>
<p>Our gentry 300 than our parents’ noble names,</p>
<p>In whose success 301 we are gentle 302 — I beseech you,</p>
<p>If you know aught 303 which does behove 304 my knowledge</p>
<p>Thereof to be informed, imprison’t not</p>
<p>In ignorant concealment.</p>
<p>CAMILLO I may not answer.</p>
<p>POLIXENES A sickness caught of me, and yet I well?</p>
<p>I must be answered. Dost thou hear, Camillo,</p>
<p>I conjure 305 thee, by all the parts 306 of man</p>
<p>Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least</p>
<p>Is not this suit 307 of mine, that thou declare</p>
<p>What incidency 308 thou dost guess of harm</p>
<p>Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near,</p>
<p>Which way to be prevented, if to be.</p>
<p>If not, how best to bear it.</p>
<p>CAMILLO Sir, I will tell you,</p>
<p>Since I am charged 309 in honour and by him</p>
<p>That I think honourable: therefore mark 310 my counsel,</p>
<p>Which must be ev’n 311 as swiftly followed as</p>
<p>I mean to utter it; or both yourself and me</p>
<p>Cry lost, and so goodnight 312 !</p>
<p>POLIXENES On, good Camillo.</p>
<p>CAMILLO I am appointed him 313 to murder you.</p>
<p>POLIXENES By whom, Camillo?</p>
<p>CAMILLO By the king.</p>
<p>POLIXENES For what?</p>
<p>CAMILLO He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,</p>
<p>As he had seen’t or been an instrument</p>
<p>To vice 314 you to’t, that you have touched his queen</p>
<p>Forbiddenly.</p>
<p>POLIXENES O, then my best 315 blood turn</p>
<p>To an infected jelly and my name</p>
<p>Be yoked with his that did betray the best!</p>
<p>Turn then my freshest reputation to</p>
<p>A savour 316 that may strike 317 the dullest 318 nostril</p>
<p>Where I arrive, and my approach be shunned,</p>
<p>Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection</p>
<p>That e’er was heard or read!</p>
<p>CAMILLO Swear his thought over 319</p>
<p>By each particular star in heaven and</p>
<p>By all their influences 320 for to 321 ; you may as well</p>
<p>Forbid the sea for to obey the moon</p>
<p>As or 322 by oath remove or counsel shake</p>
<p>The fabric 323 of his folly, whose foundation</p>
<p>Is piled upon his faith and will continue</p>
<p>The standing of his body 324 .</p>
<p>POLIXENES How should this grow 325 ?</p>
<p>CAMILLO I know not. But I am sure ’tis safer to</p>
<p>Avoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born.</p>
<p>If therefore you dare trust my honesty,</p>
<p>That lies enclosèd in this trunk 326 which you</p>
<p>Shall bear along impawned 327 , away tonight!</p>
<p>Your followers I will whisper to 328 the business,</p>
<p>And will by twos and threes at several posterns 329</p>
<p>Clear them 330 o’th’city. For myself, I’ll put</p>
<p>My fortunes to your service, which are here</p>
<p>By this discovery lost 331 . Be not uncertain,</p>
<p>For by the honour of my parents, I</p>
<p>Have uttered truth, which if you seek to prove 332 ,</p>
<p>I dare not stand by 333 ; nor shall you be safer</p>
<p>Than one condemnèd by the king’s own mouth,</p>
<p>Thereon his execution sworn.</p>
<p>POLIXENES I do believe thee:</p>
<p>I saw his heart in’s face. Give me thy hand.</p>
<p>Be pilot 334 to me and thy places 335 shall</p>
<p>Still neighbour mine 336 . My ships are ready and</p>
<p>My people did expect my hence departure 337</p>
<p>Two days ago. This jealousy</p>
<p>Is for a precious creature: as she’s rare,</p>
<p>Must it be great, and as his person’s mighty,</p>
<p>Must it be violent, and as he does conceive</p>
<p>He is dishonoured by a man which ever</p>
<p>Professed 338 to him, why, his revenges must</p>
<p>In that be made more bitter. Fear o’ershades me.</p>
<p>Good expedition 339 be my friend, and comfort</p>
<p>The gracious queen, part of his theme 340 , but nothing</p>
<p>Of his ill-ta’en 341 suspicion. Come, Camillo.</p>
<p>I will respect thee as a father if</p>
<p>Thou bear’st my life off hence. Let us avoid 342 .</p>
<p>CAMILLO It is in mine authority to command</p>
<p>The keys of all the posterns. Please your highness</p>
<p>To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
