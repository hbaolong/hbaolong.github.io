<p>Enter the King [carried in a chair ] with divers young Lords taking
leave for the Florentine war, Count Rossillion [Bertram ] and Parolles.
Flourish cornets</p>
<p>KING Farewell, young lords. These warlike principles 469</p>
<p>Do not throw from you 470 . And you, my lords, farewell.</p>
<p>Share the advice betwixt you. If both gain, all</p>
<p>The gift 471 doth stretch itself as ’tis received,</p>
<p>And is enough for both.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD ’Tis our hope, sir,</p>
<p>After well-entered 472 soldiers, to return</p>
<p>And find your grace in health.</p>
<p>KING No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart</p>
<p>Will not confess he owes 473 the malady</p>
<p>That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords.</p>
<p>Whether I live or die, be you the sons</p>
<p>Of worthy Frenchmen. Let higher Italy 474 —</p>
<p>Those bated that inherit but the fall</p>
<p>Of the last monarchy 475 — see that you come</p>
<p>Not to woo 476 honour, but to wed 477 it, when</p>
<p>The bravest questant 478 shrinks 479 . Find what you seek,</p>
<p>That fame may cry 480 you loud. I say, farewell.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Health at your bidding serve your majesty!</p>
<p>KING Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:</p>
<p>They say our French lack language to deny 481</p>
<p>If they demand. Beware of being captives 482</p>
<p>Before you serve 483 .</p>
<p>BOTH Our hearts receive your warnings.</p>
<p>KING Farewell.— Come hither to me.</p>
<p>King steps aside with some lords</p>
<p>FIRST LORD O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!</p>
<p>To Bertram</p>
<p>PAROLLES ’Tis not his fault, the spark 484 .</p>
<p>SECOND LORD O, ’tis brave 485 wars!</p>
<p>PAROLLES Most admirable. I have seen those wars.</p>
<p>BERTRAM I am commanded here 486 , and kept a coil 487 with</p>
<p>‘Too young’ and ‘the next year’ and “tis too early’.</p>
<p>PAROLLES An thy mind stand to’t, boy, steal away bravely 488 .</p>
<p>BERTRAM I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock 489 ,</p>
<p>Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry 490 ,</p>
<p>Till honour be bought up 491 and no sword worn</p>
<p>But one to dance with 492 . By heaven, I’ll steal 493 away.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD There’s honour in the theft.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Commit it, count.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD I am your accessary, and so farewell.</p>
<p>BERTRAM I grow to 494 you, and our parting is a tortured body 495
.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Farewell, captain.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Sweet Monsieur Parolles!</p>
<p>PAROLLES Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and
lustrous, a word 496 , good metals 497 . You shall find in the regiment
of the Spinii one Captain</p>
<p>Spurio 498 , with his cicatrice 499 , an emblem of war, here on his
sinister 500 cheek; it was this very sword entrenched 501 it. Say to him
I live, and observe his reports 502 for me.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD We shall, noble captain.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Mars 503 dote on you for his novices 504 !—</p>
<p>[Exeunt Lords ]</p>
<p>What will ye do?</p>
<p>To Bertram</p>
<p>BERTRAM Stay 505 the king.</p>
<p>Bertram and Parolles stand aside</p>
<p>PAROLLES Use a more spacious ceremony 506 to the noble lords. You
have restrained yourself within the list 507 of too cold an adieu. Be
more expressive to them, for they wear themselves in the cap of the time
508 , there do muster true gait 509 , eat, speak, and move under the
influence of the most received 510 star. And though the devil lead the
measure 511 , such are to be followed. After them, and take a more
dilated 512 farewell.</p>
<p>To Bertram</p>
<p>BERTRAM And I will do so.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Worthy fellows, and like 513 to prove most sinewy 514
sword-men.</p>
<p>The King comes forward</p>
<p>Exeunt [Bertram and Parolles ]</p>
<p>Enter Lafew</p>
<p>LAFEW Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings 515 .</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>KING I’ll fee 516 thee to stand up.</p>
<p>LAFEW Then here’s a man stands that has brought his pardon 517 .</p>
<p>Rises</p>
<p>I would you had kneeled, my lord, to ask me mercy,</p>
<p>And that at my bidding you could so stand up.</p>
<p>KING I would I had, so I had broke thy pate 518 ,</p>
<p>And asked thee mercy for’t.</p>
<p>LAFEW Good faith, across 519 . But, my good lord, ’tis thus:</p>
<p>Will you be cured of your infirmity?</p>
<p>KING No.</p>
<p>LAFEW O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox 520 ?</p>
<p>Yes, but you will 521 my noble grapes, an if 522</p>
<p>My royal fox could reach them. I have seen a medicine 523</p>
<p>That’s able to breathe life into a stone,</p>
<p>Quicken 524 a rock, and make you dance canary 525</p>
<p>With sprightly fire and motion, whose simple 526 touch,</p>
<p>Is powerful to araise 527 King Pippin 528 , nay,</p>
<p>To give great Charlemain a pen 529 in’s hand</p>
<p>And write to her a love-line.</p>
<p>KING What ‘her’ is this?</p>
<p>LAFEW Why, Doctor She: my lord, there’s one arrived,</p>
<p>If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,</p>
<p>If seriously I may convey my thoughts</p>
<p>In this my light 530 deliverance 531 , I have spoke</p>
<p>With one that, in her sex, her years, profession 532 ,</p>
<p>Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more</p>
<p>Than I dare blame 533 my weakness 534 . Will you see her,</p>
<p>For that is her demand, and know her business?</p>
<p>That done, laugh well at me.</p>
<p>KING Now, good Lafew,</p>
<p>Bring in the admiration 535 that we with thee</p>
<p>May spend 536 our wonder too, or take off 537 thine</p>
<p>By wondering how thou took’st 538 it.</p>
<p>LAFEW Nay, I’ll fit 539 you,</p>
<p>And not be all day neither.</p>
<p>KING Thus he his special nothing 540 ever prologues 541 .</p>
<p>Lafew goes to the door or exits and re-enters</p>
<p>Enter Helen 542</p>
<p>LAFEW Nay, come your ways 543 .</p>
<p>To Helen</p>
<p>KING This haste hath wings indeed.</p>
<p>LAFEW Nay, come your ways.</p>
<p>This is his majesty, say your mind to him.</p>
<p>A traitor you do look like, but such traitors</p>
<p>His majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid’s uncle 544 ,</p>
<p>That dare leave two together. Fare you well.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KING Now, fair one, does your business follow 545 us?</p>
<p>HELEN Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p>Gerard de Narbon was my father,</p>
<p>In what he did profess 546 , well found 547 .</p>
<p>KING I knew him.</p>
<p>HELEN The rather will I spare my praises towards him.</p>
<p>Knowing him is enough. On’s bed of death</p>
<p>Many receipts 548 he gave me, chiefly one</p>
<p>Which, as the dearest issue 549 of his practice,</p>
<p>And of his old experience th’only 550 darling,</p>
<p>He bade me store up, as a triple 551 eye,</p>
<p>Safer 552 than mine own two. More dear I have so,</p>
<p>And hearing your high majesty is touched</p>
<p>With that malignant cause wherein the honour</p>
<p>Of my dear father’s gift stands chief in power 553 ,</p>
<p>I come to tender 554 it and my appliance 555</p>
<p>With all bound 556 humbleness.</p>
<p>KING We thank you, maiden,</p>
<p>But may not be so credulous 557 of cure,</p>
<p>When our most learnèd doctors leave us, and</p>
<p>The congregated college 558 have concluded</p>
<p>That labouring art 559 can never ransom nature</p>
<p>From her inaidible 560 estate. I say we must not</p>
<p>So stain our judgement, or corrupt our hope,</p>
<p>To prostitute 561 our past-cure malady</p>
<p>To empirics 562 , or to dissever 563 so</p>
<p>Our great self 564 and our credit 565 , to esteem 566</p>
<p>A senseless 567 help when help past sense 568 we deem 569 .</p>
<p>HELEN My duty 570 then shall pay me for my pains 571 :</p>
<p>I will no more enforce mine office 572 on you,</p>
<p>Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts</p>
<p>A modest one 573 to bear me back again 574 .</p>
<p>KING I cannot give thee less, to 575 be called grateful.</p>
<p>Thou thought’st to help me, and such thanks I give</p>
<p>As one near death to those that wish him live.</p>
<p>But what at full 576 I know, thou know’st no part 577 ,</p>
<p>I knowing all my peril, thou no art 578 .</p>
<p>HELEN What I can do can do no hurt to try,</p>
<p>Since you set up your rest 579 gainst remedy.</p>
<p>He 580 that of greatest works is finisher</p>
<p>Oft does them by the weakest minister:</p>
<p>So holy writ 581 in babes 582 hath judgement shown,</p>
<p>When judges have been babes; great floods have flown</p>
<p>From simple 583 sources 584 , and great seas have dried 585</p>
<p>When miracles have by the great’st 586 been denied.</p>
<p>Oft expectation fails, and most oft there</p>
<p>Where most it promises, and oft it hits 587</p>
<p>Where hope is coldest and despair most shifts 588 .</p>
<p>KING I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid.</p>
<p>Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid 589 :</p>
<p>Proffers 590 not took reap thanks for 591 their reward.</p>
<p>HELEN Inspirèd 592 merit so by breath 593 is barred.</p>
<p>It is not so with him that all things knows</p>
<p>As ’tis with us that square 594 our guess by shows 595 .</p>
<p>But most it is presumption in us when</p>
<p>The help of heaven we count 596 the act of men.</p>
<p>Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent.</p>
<p>Of heaven, not me, make an experiment 597 .</p>
<p>I am not an impostor 598 that proclaim 599</p>
<p>Myself against the level of mine aim,</p>
<p>But know I think, and think I know most sure,</p>
<p>My art is not past power, nor you past cure.</p>
<p>KING Art thou so confident? Within what space 600</p>
<p>Hop’st thou my cure?</p>
<p>HELEN The greatest 601 grace lending grace</p>
<p>Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring</p>
<p>Their fiery torcher 602 his diurnal ring 603 ,</p>
<p>Ere twice in murk and occidental 604 damp</p>
<p>Moist Hesperus 605 hath quenched her sleepy lamp,</p>
<p>Or four and twenty times the pilot’s glass 606</p>
<p>Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,</p>
<p>What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,</p>
<p>Health shall live free and sickness freely die.</p>
<p>KING Upon thy certainty and confidence</p>
<p>What dar’st thou venture 607 ?</p>
<p>HELEN Tax 608 of impudence,</p>
<p>A strumpet’s 609 boldness, a divulgèd shame</p>
<p>Traduced 610 by odious ballads: my maiden’s name</p>
<p>Seared 611 otherwise, nay, worse of worst, extended 612</p>
<p>With vilest torture, let my life be ended.</p>
<p>KING Methinks in thee some blessèd spirit doth speak</p>
<p>His powerful sound within an organ weak:</p>
<p>And what impossibility would slay 613</p>
<p>In common sense 614 , sense saves another way.</p>
<p>Thy life is dear, for all that life can rate 615</p>
<p>Worth name of life in thee hath estimate 616 :</p>
<p>Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all</p>
<p>That happiness and prime 617 can happy call.</p>
<p>Thou this to hazard 618 needs 619 must intimate</p>
<p>Skill infinite or monstrous desperate 620 .</p>
<p>Sweet practicer 621 , thy physic 622 I will try,</p>
<p>That ministers 623 thine own death if I die.</p>
<p>HELEN If I break time 624 , or flinch in property 625</p>
<p>Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,</p>
<p>And well deserved. Not 626 helping, death’s my fee.</p>
<p>But if I help, what do you promise me?</p>
<p>KING Make thy demand.</p>
<p>HELEN But will you make it even 627 ?</p>
<p>KING Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.</p>
<p>HELEN Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand</p>
<p>What 628 husband in thy power I will command:</p>
<p>Exempted 629 be from me the arrogance</p>
<p>To choose from forth the royal blood of France,</p>
<p>My low and humble name to propagate</p>
<p>With any branch or image of thy state.</p>
<p>But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know</p>
<p>Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.</p>
<p>KING Here is my hand. The premises observed 630 ,</p>
<p>Thy will by my performance 631 shall be served.</p>
<p>So make the choice of 632 thy own time, for I,</p>
<p>Thy resolved 633 patient, on thee still 634 rely.</p>
<p>More should I question thee, and more I must —</p>
<p>Though more to know could not be more to trust —</p>
<p>From whence thou cam’st, how tended on 635 . But rest</p>
<p>Unquestioned 636 welcome and undoubted blest.—</p>
<p>Give me some help here, ho!— If thou proceed</p>
<p>As high as word 637 , my deed shall match thy deed.</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt [the King is carried out ]</p>
