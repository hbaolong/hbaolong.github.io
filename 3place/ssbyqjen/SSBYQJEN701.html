11</h4>
<p>Enter Harry Hotspur, Worcester and Douglas</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Well said, my noble Scot. If speaking truth</p>
<p>In this fine 1360 age were not thought flattery,</p>
<p>Such attribution 1361 should the Douglas have,</p>
<p>As not a 1362 soldier of this season’s stamp 1363</p>
<p>Should go so general current 1364 through the world.</p>
<p>By heaven, I cannot flatter: I defy 1365</p>
<p>The tongues of soothers 1366 . But a braver 1367 place</p>
<p>In my heart’s love hath no man than yourself.</p>
<p>Nay, task 1368 me to my word, approve me 1369 , lord.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS Thou art the king of honour:</p>
<p>No man so potent breathes upon the ground 1370</p>
<p>But I will beard 1371 him.</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>With letters</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Do so, and ’tis well.—</p>
<p>What letters hast there? — I can but 1372 thank you.</p>
<p>MESSENGER These letters come from your father.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Letters from him? Why comes he not himself?</p>
<p>MESSENGER He cannot come, my lord, he is grievous sick.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR How? Has he the leisure to be sick now</p>
<p>In such a jostling 1373 time? Who leads his power 1374 ?</p>
<p>Under whose government 1375 come they along?</p>
<p>MESSENGER His letters bears 1376 his mind, not I his mind 1377 .</p>
<p>WORCESTER I prithee tell me, doth he keep 1378 his bed?</p>
<p>MESSENGER He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,</p>
<p>And at the time of my departure thence</p>
<p>He was much feared by 1379 his physician.</p>
<p>WORCESTER I would 1380 the state of time 1381 had first been whole
1382</p>
<p>Ere he by sickness had been visited:</p>
<p>His health was never better worth 1383 than now.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Sick now? Droop now? This sickness doth infect</p>
<p>The very life-blood of our enterprise,</p>
<p>’Tis catching hither 1384 , even to our camp.</p>
<p>He writes me here that inward sickness 1385 —</p>
<p>And that his friends by deputation 1386 could not</p>
<p>So soon be drawn 1387 , nor did he think it meet 1388</p>
<p>To lay so dangerous and dear 1389 a trust</p>
<p>On any soul removed but on his own.</p>
<p>Yet doth he give us bold advertisement 1390 ,</p>
<p>That with our small conjunction 1391 we should on 1392 ,</p>
<p>To see how fortune is disposed to us,</p>
<p>For, as he writes, there is no quailing now,</p>
<p>Because the king is certainly possessed 1393</p>
<p>Of all our purposes. What say you to it?</p>
<p>WORCESTER Your father’s sickness is a maim 1394 to us.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR A perilous gash, a very limb lopped off:</p>
<p>And yet, in faith, it is not. His present want 1395</p>
<p>Seems more than we shall find it 1396 . Were it good</p>
<p>To set 1397 the exact wealth of all our states</p>
<p>All at one cast 1398 ? To set so rich a main 1399</p>
<p>On the nice hazard 1400 of one doubtful 1401 hour?</p>
<p>It were not good, for therein should we read 1402</p>
<p>The very bottom 1403 and the soul of hope,</p>
<p>The very list 1404 , the very utmost bound 1405</p>
<p>Of all our fortunes.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS ’Faith, and so we should,</p>
<p>Where now remains a sweet reversion 1406 ,</p>
<p>We may boldly spend upon the hope of what</p>
<p>Is to come in.</p>
<p>A comfort of retirement 1407 lives in this.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR A rendezvous 1408 , a home to fly unto,</p>
<p>If that the devil and mischance look big 1409</p>
<p>Upon the maidenhead 1410 of our affairs.</p>
<p>WORCESTER But yet I would your father had been here.</p>
<p>The quality and hair 1411 of our attempt</p>
<p>Brooks 1412 no division: it will be thought</p>
<p>By some, that know not why he is away,</p>
<p>That wisdom, loyalty 1413 and mere 1414 dislike</p>
<p>Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence.</p>
<p>And think how such an apprehension 1415</p>
<p>May turn the tide of fearful faction 1416</p>
<p>And breed a kind of question 1417 in our cause,</p>
<p>For well you know, we of the off’ring 1418 side</p>
<p>Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement 1419 ,</p>
<p>And stop all sight-holes, every loop 1420 from whence</p>
<p>The eye of reason may pry in upon us:</p>
<p>This absence of your father draws 1421 a curtain,</p>
<p>That shows the ignorant a kind of fear</p>
<p>Before not dreamt of.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR You strain too far 1422 .</p>
<p>I rather of his absence make this use 1423 :</p>
<p>It lends a lustre and more great opinion 1424 ,</p>
<p>A larger dare 1425 to our great enterprise,</p>
<p>Than if the earl were here, for men must think,</p>
<p>If we without his help can make a head 1426</p>
<p>To push against the kingdom, with his help</p>
<p>We shall o’erturn it topsy-turvy down.</p>
<p>Yet 1427 all goes well, yet all our joints 1428 are whole.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS As heart can think 1429 . There is not such a word</p>
<p>Spoke of in Scotland as this dream of fear.</p>
<p>Enter Sir Richard Vernon</p>
<p>HOTSPUR My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.</p>
<p>VERNON Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.</p>
<p>The Earl of Westmorland, seven thousand strong,</p>
<p>Is marching hitherwards, with him Prince John.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR No harm 1430 : what more?</p>
<p>VERNON And further, I have learned,</p>
<p>The king himself in person hath set forth,</p>
<p>Or hitherwards intended 1431 speedily,</p>
<p>With strong and mighty preparation 1432 .</p>
<p>HOTSPUR He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,</p>
<p>The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,</p>
<p>And his comrades that daffed 1433 the world aside</p>
<p>And bid it pass?</p>
<p>VERNON All furnished 1434 , all in arms,</p>
<p>All plumed like estridges 1435 that with the wind</p>
<p>Bated 1436 like eagles having lately bathed,</p>
<p>Glittering in golden coats 1437 like images 1438 ,</p>
<p>As full of spirit as the month of May,</p>
<p>And gorgeous 1439 as the sun at midsummer,</p>
<p>Wanton 1440 as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.</p>
<p>I saw young Harry with his beaver 1441 on,</p>
<p>His cuisses 1442 on his thighs, gallantly armed,</p>
<p>Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury 1443 ,</p>
<p>And vaulted with such ease into his seat 1444 ,</p>
<p>As if an angel dropped down from the clouds,</p>
<p>To turn and wind 1445 a fiery Pegasus 1446</p>
<p>And witch 1447 the world with noble horsemanship.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR No more, no more. Worse than the sun in March,</p>
<p>This praise doth nourish agues 1448 . Let them come.</p>
<p>They come like sacrifices in their trim 1449 ,</p>
<p>And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war 1450</p>
<p>All hot and bleeding will we offer them:</p>
<p>The mailèd Mars 1451 shall on his altar sit</p>
<p>Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire</p>
<p>To hear this rich reprisal 1452 is so nigh</p>
<p>And yet not ours. Come, let me take my horse,</p>
<p>Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt</p>
<p>Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>Harry to Harry, shall hot horse to horse</p>
<p>Meet and ne’er part till one drop down a corpse!</p>
<p>O, that Glendower were come!</p>
<p>VERNON There is more news:</p>
<p>I learned in Worcester 1453 , as I rode along,</p>
<p>He cannot draw his power this fourteen days 1454 .</p>
<p>DOUGLAS That’s the worst tidings that I hear of yet.</p>
<p>WORCESTER Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR What may the king’s whole battle reach unto? 1455</p>
<p>VERNON To thirty thousand.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Forty let it be.</p>
<p>My father and Glendower being both away,</p>
<p>The powers of us 1456 may serve 1457 so great a day.</p>
<p>Come, let us take a muster 1458 speedily:</p>
<p>Doomsday 1459 is near; die all, die merrily.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS Talk not of dying. I am out of 1460 fear</p>
<p>Of death or death’s hand for this one-half year 1461 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
