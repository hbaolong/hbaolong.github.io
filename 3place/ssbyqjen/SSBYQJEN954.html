14</h4>
<p>Enter Jailer, Wooer, Doctor</p>
<p>DOCTOR Her distraction is more at some time of the moon 1175 , than
at other some 1176 , is it not?</p>
<p>JAILER She is continually in a harmless distemper 1177 , sleeps
little, altogether without appetite, save often drinking, dreaming of
another world and a better: and what broken piece of matter soe’er she’s
about, the name Palamon lards 1178 it, that she farces 1179 ev’ry
business withal 1180 , fits it to every question.</p>
<p>Enter Daughter</p>
<p>Look where she comes: you shall perceive her behaviour.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER I have forgot it quite: the burden 1181 on’t was
‘Down-a down-a’ and penned by no worse man than Giraldo, Emilia’s
schoolmaster: he’s as fantastical 1182 too as ever he may go upon’s legs
1183 , for in the next world will Dido see Palamon, and then will she be
out of love with Aeneas 1184 .</p>
<p>DOCTOR What stuff ’s here? Poor soul!</p>
<p>JAILER Ev’n thus all day long.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER Now for this charm that I told you of: you must
bring a piece of silver on the tip of your tongue, or no ferry 1185 .
Then if it be your chance to come where the blessed spirits are, there’s
a sight now! We maids that have our livers 1186 perished, cracked to
pieces with love, we shall come there, and do nothing all day long but
pick flowers with Proserpine 1187 . Then will I make Palamon a nosegay,
then let him mark 1188 me — then.</p>
<p>DOCTOR How prettily 1189 she’s amiss 1190 ! Note her a little
further.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER Faith, I’ll tell you: sometime we go to barley
break 1191 , we of the blessed. Alas, ’tis a sore life they have
i’th’other place 1192 : such burning, frying, boiling, hissing, howling,
chattering, cursing. O, they have shrewd measure 1193 ! Take heed! If
one be mad, or hang or drown themselves, thither they go, Jupiter bless
us, and there shall we be put in a cauldron of lead and usurer’s grease
1194 , amongst a whole million of cutpurses, and there boil like a
gammon of bacon that will never be enough 1195 .</p>
<p>DOCTOR How her brain coins 1196 !</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER Lords and courtiers that have got maids with child,
they are in this place. They shall stand in fire up to the navel and in
ice up to th’heart, and there th’offending part burns and the deceiving
part freezes: in troth a very grievous punishment, as one would think,
for such a trifle. Believe me, one would marry a leprous 1197 witch to
be rid on’t 1198 , I’ll assure you.</p>
<p>DOCTOR How she continues this fancy! ’Tis not an engrafted 1199
madness but a most thick and profound melancholy.</p>
<p>JAILER’S DAUGHTER To hear there a proud lady and a proud city wife
howl together: I were 1200 a beast an 1201 I’d call it good sport. One
cries, ‘O, this smoke!’ another, ‘This fire!’ One cries, ‘O, that ever I
did it behind the arras 1202 !’ and then howls: th’other curses a suing
fellow 1203 and her garden-house 1204 .</p>
<p>I will be true, my stars,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>my fate … (etc. )</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>JAILER What think you of her, sir?</p>
<p>DOCTOR I think she has a perturbed mind, which I cannot minister
to.</p>
<p>JAILER Alas, what then?</p>
<p>DOCTOR Understand you she ever affected 1205 any man, ere 1206 she
beheld Palamon?</p>
<p>JAILER I was once, sir, in great hope she had fixed her liking on
this gentleman, my friend.</p>
<p>WOOER I did think so too, and would account 1207 I had a great
penn’orth on’t 1208 , to give half my state 1209 that both she and I at
this present stood unfeignedly 1210 on the same terms.</p>
<p>DOCTOR That intemperate surfeit of her eye 1211 hath distempered the
other senses. They may return and settle again to execute their
preordained faculties 1212 , but they are now in a most extravagant
vagary 1213 . This you must do: confine her to a place where the light
may rather seem to steal in than be permitted. Take upon you, young sir,
her friend, the name of Palamon. Say you come to eat with her and to
commune 1214 of love. This will catch her attention, for this her mind
beats upon 1215 : other objects that are inserted ’tween her mind and
eye become the pranks and friskins 1216 of her madness. Sing to her such
green 1217 songs of love as she says Palamon hath sung in prison. Come
to her, stuck 1218 in as sweet flowers as the season is mistress of and
thereto make an addition of some other compounded odours 1219 which are
grateful 1220 to the sense: all this shall become Palamon, for Palamon
can sing, and Palamon is sweet and ev’ry good thing. Desire to eat with
her, carve 1221 her, drink to her, and still among 1222 , intermingle
your petition of grace and acceptance into her favour: learn what maids
have been her companions and play-feres 1223 and let them repair 1224 to
her with Palamon in their mouths, and appear with tokens 1225 , as if
they suggested 1226 for him. It is a falsehood she is in, which is with
falsehoods to be combated. This may bring her to eat, to sleep, and
reduce 1227 what’s now out of square 1228 in her into their former law
and regiment. I have seen it approved 1229 , how many times I know not,
but to make the number more I have great hope in this. I will, between
the passages 1230 of this project, come in with my appliance 1231 . Let
us put it in execution and hasten the success 1232 , which, doubt not,
will bring forth comfort.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
