continues</h4>
<p>Enter Provost [and a ] Servant</p>
<p>SERVANT He’s 417 hearing of a cause: he will come straight,</p>
<p>I’ll tell him of you.</p>
<p>PROVOST Pray you, do.— I’ll know</p>
<p>[Exit Servant ]</p>
<p>His pleasure 418 , maybe he will relent. Alas,</p>
<p>He 419 hath but as offended 420 in a dream!</p>
<p>All sects 421 , all ages smack 422 of this vice, and he</p>
<p>To die for’t?</p>
<p>Enter Angelo</p>
<p>ANGELO Now, what’s the matter, provost?</p>
<p>PROVOST Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?</p>
<p>ANGELO Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?</p>
<p>Why dost thou ask again?</p>
<p>PROVOST Lest 423 I might be too rash.</p>
<p>Under your good correction 424 , I have seen</p>
<p>When, after execution, judgement hath</p>
<p>Repented o’er his doom 425 .</p>
<p>ANGELO Go to, let that be mine 426 .</p>
<p>Do you your office, or give up your place,</p>
<p>And you shall well be spared 427 .</p>
<p>PROVOST I crave your honour’s pardon.</p>
<p>What shall be done, sir, with the groaning 428 Juliet?</p>
<p>She’s very near her hour 429 .</p>
<p>ANGELO Dispose of 430 her</p>
<p>To some more fitter place, and that with speed.</p>
<p>[Enter Servant ]</p>
<p>SERVANT Here is the sister of the man condemned</p>
<p>Desires access to you.</p>
<p>ANGELO Hath he a sister?</p>
<p>PROVOST Ay, my good lord, a very virtuous maid,</p>
<p>And to be shortly of a sisterhood 431 ,</p>
<p>If not already.</p>
<p>ANGELO Well, let her be admitted.</p>
<p>[Exit Servant ]</p>
<p>See you the fornicatress 432 be removed.</p>
<p>Let her have needful but not lavish means.</p>
<p>There shall be order 433 for’t.</p>
<p>Enter Lucio and Isabella</p>
<p>PROVOST ’Save your honour!</p>
<p>ANGELO Stay a little while.—</p>
<p>To Provost</p>
<p>You’re welcome: what’s your will?</p>
<p>To Isabella</p>
<p>ISABELLA I am a woeful suitor 434 to your honour,</p>
<p>Please but your honour hear me.</p>
<p>ANGELO Well, what’s your suit?</p>
<p>ISABELLA There is a vice that most I do abhor,</p>
<p>And most desire should meet the blow of justice,</p>
<p>For which I would not plead, but that I must,</p>
<p>For which I must not plead, but that I am</p>
<p>At war ’twixt will and will not 435 .</p>
<p>ANGELO Well, the matter 436 ?</p>
<p>ISABELLA I have a brother is condemned to die:</p>
<p>I do beseech you, let it be his fault,</p>
<p>And not my brother 437 .</p>
<p>PROVOST Heaven give thee moving 438 graces!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>ANGELO Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?</p>
<p>Why, every fault’s condemned ere it be done 439 :</p>
<p>Mine were the very cipher of a function 440 ,</p>
<p>To fine 441 the faults whose fine stands in record 442 ,</p>
<p>And let go by 443 the actor.</p>
<p>ISABELLA O, just but severe law!</p>
<p>I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour.</p>
<p>LUCIO Give’t not o’er so 444 . To him again, entreat him,</p>
<p>Aside to Isabella</p>
<p>Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown.</p>
<p>You are too cold. If you should need a pin 445 ,</p>
<p>You could not with more tame a tongue desire it.</p>
<p>To him, I say!</p>
<p>ISABELLA Must he needs die?</p>
<p>To Angelo</p>
<p>ANGELO Maiden, no remedy.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Yes, I do think that you might pardon him,</p>
<p>And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.</p>
<p>ANGELO I will not do’t.</p>
<p>ISABELLA But can you, if you would 446 ?</p>
<p>ANGELO Look what 447 I will not, that I cannot do.</p>
<p>ISABELLA But might you do’t, and do the world no wrong,</p>
<p>If so your heart were touched with that remorse 448</p>
<p>As mine is to him?</p>
<p>ANGELO He’s sentenced, ’tis too late.</p>
<p>LUCIO You are too cold.</p>
<p>Aside to Isabella</p>
<p>ISABELLA Too late? Why, no, I that do speak a word</p>
<p>May call it back again. Well, believe this:</p>
<p>No ceremony that to great ones ’longs 449 ,</p>
<p>Not the king’s crown, nor the deputed sword 450 ,</p>
<p>The marshal 451 ’s truncheon 452 , nor the judge’s robe,</p>
<p>Become 453 them with one half so good a grace 454</p>
<p>As mercy does.</p>
<p>If he had been as you 455 and you as he,</p>
<p>You would have slipped like him, but he, like you,</p>
<p>Would not have been so stern.</p>
<p>ANGELO Pray you, be gone.</p>
<p>ISABELLA I would to heaven I had your potency 456 ,</p>
<p>And you were Isabel. Should it then be thus?</p>
<p>No, I would tell 457 what ’twere to be a judge,</p>
<p>And what a prisoner.</p>
<p>LUCIO Ay, touch him, there’s the vein 458 .</p>
<p>Aside to Isabella</p>
<p>ANGELO Your brother is a forfeit of 459 the law,</p>
<p>And you but waste your words.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Alas, alas!</p>
<p>Why, all the souls that were 460 were forfeit once,</p>
<p>And he 461 that might the vantage 462 best have took</p>
<p>Found out the remedy. How would you be,</p>
<p>If he, which is the top of judgement, should</p>
<p>But judge you as you are? O, think on that,</p>
<p>And mercy then will breathe within your lips</p>
<p>Like man new made 463 .</p>
<p>ANGELO Be you content, fair maid,</p>
<p>It is the law, not I, condemn your brother.</p>
<p>Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,</p>
<p>It should be thus with him. He must die tomorrow.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Tomorrow? O, that’s sudden! Spare him, spare him!</p>
<p>He’s not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens</p>
<p>We kill the fowl of season 464 : shall we serve heaven</p>
<p>With less respect than we do minister 465</p>
<p>To our gross 466 selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you 467 ;</p>
<p>Who is it that hath died for this offence?</p>
<p>There’s many have committed it.</p>
<p>LUCIO Ay, well said.</p>
<p>Aside to Isabella</p>
<p>ANGELO The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:</p>
<p>Those many had not dared to do that evil,</p>
<p>If the first that did th’edict infringe</p>
<p>Had answered for his deed 468 . Now ’tis awake,</p>
<p>Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,</p>
<p>Looks in a glass 469 that shows what future evils,</p>
<p>Either now 470 , or by remissness new-conceived 471 ,</p>
<p>And so in progress to be hatched and born 472 ,</p>
<p>Are now to have no successive degrees 473 ,</p>
<p>But ere 474 they live to end 475 .</p>
<p>ISABELLA Yet show some pity.</p>
<p>ANGELO I show it most of all when I show justice:</p>
<p>For then I pity those I do not know,</p>
<p>Which a dismissed 476 offence would after gall 477 ,</p>
<p>And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,</p>
<p>Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;</p>
<p>Your brother dies tomorrow; be content.</p>
<p>ISABELLA So you must be the first that gives this sentence,</p>
<p>And he, that suffers. O, it is excellent</p>
<p>To have a giant’s strength, but it is tyrannous</p>
<p>To use it like a giant.</p>
<p>LUCIO That’s well said.</p>
<p>Aside to Isabella</p>
<p>ISABELLA Could great men thunder</p>
<p>As Jove 478 himself does, Jove would ne’er be quiet 479 ,</p>
<p>For every pelting 480 , petty officer</p>
<p>Would use his heaven for thunder,</p>
<p>Nothing but thunder! Merciful heaven,</p>
<p>Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt 481</p>
<p>Splits the unwedgeable 482 and gnarlèd oak 483</p>
<p>Than the soft myrtle 484 : but man, proud man,</p>
<p>Dressed in a little brief 485 authority,</p>
<p>Most ignorant of what he’s most assured 486 —</p>
<p>His glassy 487 essence — like an angry ape</p>
<p>Plays such fantastic 488 tricks before high heaven</p>
<p>As makes the angels weep, who, with our spleens 489 ,</p>
<p>Would all themselves laugh mortal 490 .</p>
<p>LUCIO O, to him, to him, wench: he will relent.</p>
<p>Aside to Isabella</p>
<p>He’s coming 491 , I perceive’t.</p>
<p>PROVOST Pray heaven she win him.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>ISABELLA We cannot weigh our brother with ourself 492 .</p>
<p>Great men may jest with 493 saints, ’tis wit 494 in them,</p>
<p>But in the less foul profanation 495 .</p>
<p>LUCIO Thou’rt i’th’right, girl, more o’that.</p>
<p>Aside to Isabella</p>
<p>ISABELLA That in the captain’s but a choleric 496 word,</p>
<p>Which in the soldier is flat 497 blasphemy.</p>
<p>LUCIO Art avised 498 o’that? More on’t.</p>
<p>Aside to Isabella</p>
<p>ANGELO Why do you put 499 these sayings upon me?</p>
<p>ISABELLA Because authority, though it err like others,</p>
<p>Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself</p>
<p>That skins 500 the vice o’th’top. Go to your bosom,</p>
<p>Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know</p>
<p>That’s like my brother’s fault. If it confess</p>
<p>A natural guiltiness 501 such as is his,</p>
<p>Let it not sound 502 a thought upon your tongue</p>
<p>Against my brother’s life.</p>
<p>ANGELO She speaks, and ’tis such sense 503</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>That my sense 504 breeds 505 with it.— Fare you well.</p>
<p>Starts to go</p>
<p>ISABELLA Gentle my lord, turn back.</p>
<p>ANGELO I will bethink me. Come again tomorrow.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Hark how I’ll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.</p>
<p>ANGELO How? Bribe me?</p>
<p>ISABELLA Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.</p>
<p>LUCIO You had marred all else 506 .</p>
<p>Aside to Isabella</p>
<p>ISABELLA Not with fond 507 sicles 508 of the tested 509 gold,</p>
<p>Or stones 510 whose rates 511 are either rich or poor</p>
<p>As fancy 512 values them, but with true 513 prayers</p>
<p>That shall be up at heaven and enter there</p>
<p>Ere sunrise, prayers from preservèd 514 souls,</p>
<p>From fasting maids 515 whose minds are dedicate 516</p>
<p>To nothing temporal 517 .</p>
<p>ANGELO Well, come to me tomorrow.</p>
<p>LUCIO Go to, ’tis well; away!</p>
<p>Aside to Isabella</p>
<p>ISABELLA Heaven keep your honour safe.</p>
<p>ANGELO Amen.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>For I am that way going to temptation,</p>
<p>Where prayers cross 518 .</p>
<p>ISABELLA At what hour tomorrow</p>
<p>Shall I attend your lordship?</p>
<p>ANGELO At any time ’fore noon.</p>
<p>ISABELLA ’Save 519 your honour!</p>
<p>[Exeunt Isabella, Lucio and Provost ]</p>
<p>ANGELO From thee, even from thy virtue.</p>
<p>What’s this? What’s this? Is this her fault or mine?</p>
<p>The tempter or the tempted, who sins most? Ha?</p>
<p>Not she — nor doth she tempt — but it is I</p>
<p>That, lying by the violet 520 in the sun,</p>
<p>Do as the carrion 521 does, not as the flower,</p>
<p>Corrupt with virtuous season 522 . Can it be</p>
<p>That modesty 523 may more betray our sense</p>
<p>Than woman’s lightness 524 ? Having waste ground 525 enough,</p>
<p>Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary 526</p>
<p>And pitch 527 our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!</p>
<p>What dost thou? Or what art thou, Angelo?</p>
<p>Dost thou desire her foully 528 for those things</p>
<p>That make her good? O, let her brother live!</p>
<p>Thieves for their robbery have authority</p>
<p>When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,</p>
<p>That I desire to hear her speak again,</p>
<p>And feast upon her eyes? What is’t I dream on?</p>
<p>O cunning enemy 529 , that to catch a saint</p>
<p>With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous</p>
<p>Is that temptation that doth goad us on</p>
<p>To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,</p>
<p>With all her double vigour 530 , art and nature 531 ,</p>
<p>Once stir my temper 532 , but this virtuous maid</p>
<p>Subdues me quite. Ever till now,</p>
<p>When men were fond 533 , I smiled and wondered how.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
