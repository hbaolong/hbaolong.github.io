30</h4>
<p>Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras and Mardian</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA My desolation 1742 does begin to make</p>
<p>A better life 1743 : ’tis paltry to be Caesar:</p>
<p>Not being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave 1744 ,</p>
<p>A minister of her will: and it is great</p>
<p>To do that thing 1745 that ends all other deeds,</p>
<p>Which shackles accidents and bolts up change 1746 ,</p>
<p>Which sleeps, and never palates 1747 more the dung 1748 ,</p>
<p>The beggar’s nurse and Caesar’s 1749 .</p>
<p>Enter Proculeius</p>
<p>PROCULEIUS Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt,</p>
<p>And bids thee study on 1750 what fair 1751 demands</p>
<p>Thou mean’st 1752 to have him grant thee.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA What’s thy name?</p>
<p>PROCULEIUS My name is Proculeius.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Antony</p>
<p>Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but</p>
<p>I do not greatly care to be deceived</p>
<p>That have no use for trusting 1753 . If your master</p>
<p>Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him</p>
<p>That majesty, to keep decorum, must</p>
<p>No less beg than a kingdom: if he please</p>
<p>To give me conquered Egypt for my son,</p>
<p>He gives me so much of mine own as I</p>
<p>Will kneel to him with thanks.</p>
<p>PROCULEIUS Be of good cheer:</p>
<p>You’re fall’n into a princely hand, fear nothing.</p>
<p>Make your full reference 1754 freely to my lord,</p>
<p>Who is so full of grace 1755 that it flows over</p>
<p>On all that need. Let me report to him</p>
<p>Your sweet dependency 1756 , and you shall find</p>
<p>A conqueror that will pray in aid 1757 for kindness</p>
<p>Where he for grace is kneeled to.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Pray you, tell him</p>
<p>I am his fortune’s vassal 1758 and I send him</p>
<p>The greatness he has got 1759 . I hourly learn</p>
<p>A doctrine 1760 of obedience, and would gladly</p>
<p>Look him i’th’face.</p>
<p>PROCULEIUS This I’ll report, dear lady.</p>
<p>Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied</p>
<p>Of him that caused it.—</p>
<p>[Enter Gallus and Roman Soldiers ]</p>
<p>You see how easily she may be surprised 1761 :</p>
<p>To the Soldiers</p>
<p>Guard her till Caesar come.</p>
<p>[Exit Gallus and Soldiers ]</p>
<p>IRAS Royal queen!</p>
<p>CHARMIAN O Cleopatra, thou art taken, queen!</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Quick, quick, good hands!</p>
<p>Draws a dagger</p>
<p>PROCULEIUS Hold, worthy lady, hold!</p>
<p>Disarms her</p>
<p>Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this</p>
<p>Relieved 1762 , but not betrayed.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA What, of death too,</p>
<p>That rids our dogs of anguish?</p>
<p>PROCULEIUS Cleopatra,</p>
<p>Do not abuse my master’s bounty by</p>
<p>Th’undoing of yourself: let the world see</p>
<p>His nobleness well acted, which your death</p>
<p>Will never let come forth 1763 .</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Where art thou, death?</p>
<p>Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen</p>
<p>Worthy many babes and beggars!</p>
<p>PROCULEIUS O, temperance, lady!</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Sir, I will eat no meat 1764 , I’ll not drink, sir:</p>
<p>If idle talk will once be necessary 1765 ,</p>
<p>I’ll not sleep neither. This mortal house 1766 I’ll ruin,</p>
<p>Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I</p>
<p>Will not wait pinioned 1767 at your master’s court,</p>
<p>Nor once be chastised with the sober eye</p>
<p>Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up</p>
<p>And show me to the shouting varletry 1768</p>
<p>Of censuring 1769 Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt.</p>
<p>Be gentle grave unto me! Rather on Nilus’ mud</p>
<p>Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies</p>
<p>Blow me into abhorring 1770 ! Rather make</p>
<p>My country’s high pyramides my gibbet 1771</p>
<p>And hang me up in chains!</p>
<p>PROCULEIUS You do extend 1772</p>
<p>These thoughts of horror further than you shall</p>
<p>Find cause in Caesar.</p>
<p>Enter Dolabella</p>
<p>DOLABELLA Proculeius,</p>
<p>What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,</p>
<p>And he hath sent for thee. For 1773 the queen,</p>
<p>I’ll take her to my guard.</p>
<p>PROCULEIUS So, Dolabella,</p>
<p>It shall content me best: be gentle to her.—</p>
<p>To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,</p>
<p>To Cleopatra</p>
<p>If you’ll employ me to him.</p>
<p>Exit Proculeius [with Gallus and Soldiers ]</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Say I would die.</p>
<p>DOLABELLA Most noble empress, you have heard of me?</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA I cannot tell.</p>
<p>DOLABELLA Assuredly you know me.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.</p>
<p>You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams:</p>
<p>Is’t not your trick 1774 ?</p>
<p>DOLABELLA I understand not, madam.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony:</p>
<p>O, such another sleep, that I might see</p>
<p>But such another man!</p>
<p>DOLABELLA If it might please ye—</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA His face was as the heavens, and therein stuck 1775</p>
<p>A sun and moon which kept their course and lighted</p>
<p>The little 1776 o’th’earth.</p>
<p>DOLABELLA Most sovereign creature—</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA His legs bestrid 1777 the ocean, his reared 1778 arm</p>
<p>Crested 1779 the world: his voice was propertied</p>
<p>As all the tunèd spheres 1780 , and that to friends 1781 :</p>
<p>But when he meant to quail 1782 and shake the orb 1783 ,</p>
<p>He was as rattling thunder. For 1784 his bounty,</p>
<p>There was no winter in’t: an autumn it was</p>
<p>That grew the more by reaping. His delights</p>
<p>Were dolphin-like: they showed his back above</p>
<p>The element they lived in 1785 . In his livery 1786</p>
<p>Walked crowns and crownets 1787 , realms and islands were</p>
<p>As plates 1788 dropped from his pocket.</p>
<p>DOLABELLA Cleopatra!</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Think you there was or might be such a man</p>
<p>As this I dreamt of?</p>
<p>DOLABELLA Gentle madam, no.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA You lie up to the hearing of the gods!</p>
<p>But if there be nor ever were one such,</p>
<p>It’s past the size 1789 of dreaming. Nature wants stuff</p>
<p>To vie strange forms with fancy 1790 : yet t’imagine</p>
<p>An Antony were nature’s piece gainst fancy,</p>
<p>Condemning shadows quite 1791 .</p>
<p>DOLABELLA Hear me, good madam:</p>
<p>Your loss is as yourself, great, and you bear it</p>
<p>As answering to the weight 1792 . Would I might never</p>
<p>O’ertake pursued success: but I do feel,</p>
<p>By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites</p>
<p>My very heart at root 1793 .</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA I thank you, sir.</p>
<p>Know you what Caesar means to do with me?</p>
<p>DOLABELLA I am loath 1794 to tell you what I would 1795 you knew.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Nay, pray you, sir.</p>
<p>DOLABELLA Though he be honourable—</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA He’ll lead me, then, in triumph.</p>
<p>DOLABELLA Madam, he will, I know’t.</p>
<p>Flourish. Enter Proculeius, Caesar, Gallus, Maecenas and others of
his train</p>
<p>ALL Make way there! Caesar!</p>
<p>CAESAR Which is the Queen of Egypt?</p>
<p>DOLABELLA It is the emperor, madam.</p>
<p>Cleopatra kneels</p>
<p>CAESAR Arise, you shall not kneel:</p>
<p>I pray you rise. Rise, Egypt.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Sir, the gods</p>
<p>Will have it thus. My master and my lord</p>
<p>I must obey.</p>
<p>She stands</p>
<p>CAESAR Take to you no hard thoughts 1796 .</p>
<p>The record of what injuries you did us,</p>
<p>Though written in our flesh 1797 , we shall remember</p>
<p>As things but done by chance.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Sole sir 1798 o’th’world,</p>
<p>I cannot project 1799 mine own cause so well</p>
<p>To make it clear, but do confess I have</p>
<p>Been laden with like frailties 1800 which before</p>
<p>Have often shamed our sex.</p>
<p>CAESAR Cleopatra, know,</p>
<p>We will extenuate rather than enforce 1801 :</p>
<p>If you apply yourself to our intents 1802 ,</p>
<p>Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find</p>
<p>A benefit in this change: but if you seek</p>
<p>To lay on me a cruelty 1803 by taking</p>
<p>Antony’s course, you shall bereave 1804 yourself</p>
<p>Of my good purposes, and put your children</p>
<p>To that destruction which I’ll guard them from</p>
<p>If thereon you rely. I’ll take my leave.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA And may through all the world: ’tis yours, and we,</p>
<p>Your scutcheons 1805 and your signs 1806 of conquest, shall</p>
<p>Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.</p>
<p>Gives him a paper</p>
<p>CAESAR You shall advise me in all for 1807 Cleopatra.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA This is the brief 1808 of money, plate, and jewels</p>
<p>I am possessed of. ’Tis exactly valued,</p>
<p>Not petty things admitted 1809 .— Where’s Seleucus?</p>
<p>[Enter Seleucus ]</p>
<p>SELEUCUS Here, madam.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA This is my treasurer. Let him speak, my lord,</p>
<p>Upon his peril, that I have reserved</p>
<p>To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.</p>
<p>SELEUCUS Madam,</p>
<p>I had rather seal my lips than to my peril</p>
<p>Speak that which is not.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA What have I kept back?</p>
<p>SELEUCUS Enough to purchase what you have made known.</p>
<p>CAESAR Nay, blush not, Cleopatra: I approve</p>
<p>Your wisdom in the deed.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA See, Caesar! O, behold,</p>
<p>How pomp is followed 1810 ! Mine 1811 will now be yours</p>
<p>And should we shift estates 1812 , yours would be mine.</p>
<p>The ingratitude of this Seleucus does</p>
<p>Even make me wild.— O slave, of no more trust</p>
<p>Than love that’s hired 1813 ! What, go’st thou back? Thou shalt</p>
<p>Seleucus backs away</p>
<p>Go back, I warrant thee: but I’ll catch thine eyes</p>
<p>Though 1814 they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!</p>
<p>O rarely 1815 base!</p>
<p>CAESAR Good queen, let us entreat you.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,</p>
<p>That thou, vouchsafing 1816 here to visit me,</p>
<p>Doing the honour of thy lordliness</p>
<p>To one so meek, that mine own servant should</p>
<p>Parcel 1817 the sum of my disgraces by</p>
<p>Addition of his envy. Say, good Caesar,</p>
<p>That I some lady 1818 trifles have reserved,</p>
<p>Immoment toys 1819 , things of such dignity</p>
<p>As we greet modern 1820 friends withal 1821 , and say</p>
<p>Some nobler token I have kept apart</p>
<p>For Livia 1822 and Octavia, to induce</p>
<p>Their mediation: must I be unfolded</p>
<p>With 1823 one that I have bred 1824 ? The gods! It smites me</p>
<p>Beneath the fall I have.— Prithee go hence,</p>
<p>To Seleucus</p>
<p>Or I shall show the cinders 1825 of my spirits</p>
<p>Through th’ashes of my chance 1826 . Wert thou a man,</p>
<p>Thou wouldst have mercy on me.</p>
<p>CAESAR Forbear 1827 , Seleucus.</p>
<p>[Exit Seleucus ]</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought 1828</p>
<p>For things that others do, and when we fall,</p>
<p>We answer others’ merits 1829 in our name,</p>
<p>Are therefore to be pitied.</p>
<p>CAESAR Cleopatra,</p>
<p>Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged</p>
<p>Put we i’th’roll of conquest 1830 . Still be’t yours,</p>
<p>Bestow 1831 it at your pleasure, and believe</p>
<p>Caesar’s no merchant to make prize 1832 with you</p>
<p>Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheered:</p>
<p>Make not your thoughts your prisons 1833 . No, dear queen,</p>
<p>For we intend so to dispose 1834 you as</p>
<p>Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:</p>
<p>Our care and pity is so much upon you</p>
<p>That we remain your friend, and so, adieu.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA My master, and my lord!</p>
<p>CAESAR Not so. Adieu.</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt Caesar and his Train</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA He words me 1835 , girls, he words me, that I should
not</p>
<p>Be noble to myself 1836 .— But, hark thee, Charmian.</p>
<p>Whispers to Charmian</p>
<p>IRAS Finish, good lady, the bright day is done</p>
<p>And we are for the dark.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Hie thee again 1837 .</p>
<p>I have spoke 1838 already and it is provided.</p>
<p>Go put it to the haste 1839 .</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Madam, I will.</p>
<p>Enter Dolabella</p>
<p>DOLABELLA Where’s the queen?</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Behold, sir.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Dolabella!</p>
<p>DOLABELLA Madam, as thereto sworn by your command —</p>
<p>Which my love makes religion to obey —</p>
<p>I tell you this: Caesar through Syria</p>
<p>Intends his journey, and within three days</p>
<p>You with your children will he send before 1840 .</p>
<p>Make your best use of this. I have performed</p>
<p>Your pleasure and my promise.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Dolabella,</p>
<p>I shall remain your debtor.</p>
<p>DOLABELLA I your servant.</p>
<p>Adieu, good queen, I must attend on Caesar.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Farewell, and thanks.— Now, Iras, what think’st thou?</p>
<p>Thou an Egyptian puppet 1841 shalt be shown</p>
<p>In Rome, as well as I. Mechanic slaves 1842</p>
<p>With greasy aprons, rules 1843 and hammers shall</p>
<p>Uplift us to the view. In their thick 1844 breaths,</p>
<p>Rank of 1845 gross diet, shall we be enclouded,</p>
<p>And forced to drink 1846 their vapour.</p>
<p>IRAS The gods forbid!</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Nay, ’tis most certain, Iras. Saucy 1847 lictors 1848</p>
<p>Will catch at us like strumpets 1849 , and scald 1850 rhymers</p>
<p>Ballad us 1851 out o’tune. The quick 1852 comedians 1853</p>
<p>Extemporally 1854 will stage us and present</p>
<p>Our Alexandrian revels: Antony</p>
<p>Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see</p>
<p>Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness 1855</p>
<p>I’th’posture of a whore.</p>
<p>IRAS O the good gods!</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Nay, that’s certain.</p>
<p>IRAS I’ll never see’t, for I am sure my nails</p>
<p>Are stronger than mine eyes.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Why, that’s the way</p>
<p>To fool their preparation and to conquer</p>
<p>Their most absurd intents.—</p>
<p>Enter Charmian</p>
<p>Now, Charmian!</p>
<p>Show me 1856 , my women, like a queen: go fetch</p>
<p>My best attires 1857 . I am again for Cydnus 1858</p>
<p>To meet Mark Antony.— Sirrah 1859 Iras, go.—</p>
<p>Now, noble Charmian, we’ll dispatch 1860 indeed,</p>
<p>And when thou hast done this chare 1861 , I’ll give thee leave</p>
<p>To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.</p>
<p>[Exit Iras ]</p>
<p>A noise within</p>
<p>Wherefore’s this noise?</p>
<p>Enter a Guardsman</p>
<p>GUARDSMAN Here is a rural fellow</p>
<p>That will not be denied your highness’ presence.</p>
<p>He brings you figs.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Let him come in.—</p>
<p>Exit Guardsman</p>
<p>What poor an 1862 instrument</p>
<p>May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.</p>
<p>My resolution’s placed 1863 , and I have nothing</p>
<p>Of woman in me: now from head to foot</p>
<p>I am marble-constant 1864 : now the fleeting 1865 moon</p>
<p>No planet is of mine.</p>
<p>Enter Guardsman and Clown 1866</p>
<p>With a basket</p>
<p>GUARDSMAN This is the man.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Avoid 1867 , and leave him.—</p>
<p>Exit Guardsman</p>
<p>Hast thou the pretty worm 1868 of Nilus there</p>
<p>That kills and pains not?</p>
<p>CLOWN Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party that should
desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal 1869 : those that do
die of it do seldom or never recover.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Remember’st thou any that have died on’t 1870 ?</p>
<p>CLOWN Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no longer
than yesterday: a very honest 1871 woman, but something given to lie
1872 , as a woman should not do 1873 but in the way of honesty. How she
died 1874 of the biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes a
very good report o’th’worm 1875 . But he that will believe all that they
say, shall never be saved by half that they do. But this is most
falliable 1876 , the worm’s an odd worm.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Get thee hence. Farewell.</p>
<p>CLOWN I wish you all joy of the worm.</p>
<p>Sets down his basket</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Farewell.</p>
<p>CLOWN You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind
1877 .</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Ay, ay. Farewell.</p>
<p>CLOWN Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of
wise people, for, indeed, there is no goodness in the worm.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Take thou no care 1878 , it shall be heeded.</p>
<p>CLOWN Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth the
feeding.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Will it eat 1879 me?</p>
<p>CLOWN You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself
will not eat a woman: I know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the
devil dress 1880 her not. But truly, these same whoreson 1881 devils do
the gods great harm in their women, for in every ten that they make, the
devils mar five.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Well, get thee gone. Farewell.</p>
<p>CLOWN Yes, forsooth 1882 : I wish you joy o’th’worm.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>[Enter Iras ]</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Give me my robe, put on my crown: I have</p>
<p>Iras brings a robe, crown and jewels</p>
<p>Immortal longings 1883 in me. Now no more</p>
<p>The juice of Egypt’s grape shall moist this lip.</p>
<p>The women dress her</p>
<p>Yare 1884 , yare, good Iras! Quick! Methinks I hear</p>
<p>Antony call: I see him rouse himself 1885</p>
<p>To praise my noble act 1886 . I hear him mock</p>
<p>The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men</p>
<p>To excuse their after wrath 1887 .— Husband, I come 1888 !</p>
<p>Now to that name my courage prove my title 1889 !</p>
<p>I am fire and air 1890 : my other elements</p>
<p>I give to baser life.— So, have you done?</p>
<p>Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.</p>
<p>Farewell, kind Charmian. Iras, long farewell.</p>
<p>Kisses them. Iras falls and dies</p>
<p>Have I the aspic 1891 in my lips? Dost fall?</p>
<p>If thou and nature can so gently part,</p>
<p>The stroke 1892 of death is as a lover’s pinch</p>
<p>Which hurts and is desired. Dost thou lie still?</p>
<p>If thus thou vanishest, thou tell’st the world</p>
<p>It is not worth leave-taking 1893 .</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Dissolve thick cloud, and rain, that I may say,</p>
<p>The gods themselves do weep!</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA This 1894 proves me base:</p>
<p>If she first meet the curlèd 1895 Antony,</p>
<p>He’ll make demand of her, and spend 1896 that kiss</p>
<p>Which is my heaven to have.— Come, thou mortal 1897 wretch,</p>
<p>To an asp, which she applies to her breast</p>
<p>With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate 1898</p>
<p>Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool 1899</p>
<p>Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,</p>
<p>That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass</p>
<p>Unpolicied 1900 !</p>
<p>CHARMIAN O eastern star 1901 !</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Peace, peace!</p>
<p>Dost thou not see my baby at my breast</p>
<p>That sucks the nurse asleep?</p>
<p>CHARMIAN O, break! O, break!</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle.—</p>
<p>O Antony!— Nay, I will take thee too.</p>
<p>Applies another asp to her arm</p>
<p>What 1902 should I stay—</p>
<p>Dies</p>
<p>CHARMIAN In this wild world? So, fare thee well.—</p>
<p>Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies</p>
<p>A lass unparalleled.— Downy windows 1903 , close,</p>
<p>And golden Phoebus never be beheld</p>
<p>Of 1904 eyes again so royal!— Your crown’s awry 1905 .</p>
<p>I’ll mend 1906 it, and then play—</p>
<p>Enter the Guard, rustling 1907 in</p>
<p>FIRST GUARD Where’s the queen?</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Speak softly, wake her not.</p>
<p>FIRST GUARD Caesar hath sent—</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Too slow a messenger.—</p>
<p>Applies an asp</p>
<p>O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.</p>
<p>FIRST GUARD Approach, ho! All’s not well: Caesar’s beguiled 1908
.</p>
<p>SECOND GUARD There’s Dolabella sent from Caesar: call him.</p>
<p>[Exit a Guardsman ]</p>
<p>FIRST GUARD What work is here, Charmian? Is this 1909 well done?</p>
<p>CHARMIAN It is well done, and fitting for a princess</p>
<p>Descended of so many royal kings.</p>
<p>Ah, soldier!</p>
<p>Charmian dies</p>
<p>Enter Dolabella</p>
<p>DOLABELLA How goes it here?</p>
<p>SECOND GUARD All dead.</p>
<p>DOLABELLA Caesar, thy thoughts</p>
<p>Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming</p>
<p>To see performed the dreaded act which thou</p>
<p>So sought’st to hinder.</p>
<p>Enter Caesar and all his Train 1910 marching</p>
<p>ALL A way there, a way for Caesar!</p>
<p>DOLABELLA O, sir, you are too sure an augurer 1911 :</p>
<p>That 1912 you did fear is done.</p>
<p>CAESAR Bravest at the last,</p>
<p>She levelled 1913 at our purposes 1914 and, being royal,</p>
<p>Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?</p>
<p>I do not see them bleed.</p>
<p>DOLABELLA Who was last with them?</p>
<p>FIRST GUARD A simple 1915 countryman, that brought her figs:</p>
<p>This was his basket.</p>
<p>CAESAR Poisoned, then.</p>
<p>FIRST GUARD O Caesar,</p>
<p>This Charmian lived but now. She stood and spake.</p>
<p>I found her trimming up 1916 the diadem 1917</p>
<p>On her dead mistress. Tremblingly she stood</p>
<p>And on the sudden dropped.</p>
<p>CAESAR O, noble weakness!</p>
<p>If they had swallowed poison, ’twould appear</p>
<p>By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,</p>
<p>As 1918 she would catch another Antony</p>
<p>In her strong toil 1919 of grace 1920 .</p>
<p>DOLABELLA Here on her breast</p>
<p>There is a vent 1921 of blood and something blown 1922 ,</p>
<p>The like is on her arm.</p>
<p>FIRST GUARD This is an aspic’s trail, and these fig-leaves</p>
<p>Have slime upon them such as th’aspic leaves</p>
<p>Upon the caves of Nile.</p>
<p>CAESAR Most probable</p>
<p>That so she died, for her physician tells me</p>
<p>She hath pursued conclusions infinite 1923</p>
<p>Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,</p>
<p>And bear her women from the monument.</p>
<p>She shall be buried by her Antony.</p>
<p>No grave upon the earth shall clip 1924 in it</p>
<p>A pair so famous: high 1925 events as these</p>
<p>Strike those that make them 1926 , and their story is</p>
<p>No less in pity than his glory which</p>
<p>Brought them to be lamented 1927 . Our army shall</p>
<p>In solemn show attend this funeral,</p>
<p>And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see</p>
<p>High order in this great solemnity.</p>
<p>Exeunt all</p>
<p>The Soldiers bearing</p>
<p>the dead bodies</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster , and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading ‘bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
