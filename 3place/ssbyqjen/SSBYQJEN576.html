<h4 id="scene-2-429-running-scene-5">Scene 2 429 / running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter Enobarbus and Lepidus</p>
<p>LEPIDUS Good Enobarbus, ’tis a worthy deed,</p>
<p>And shall become you well, to entreat your captain</p>
<p>To soft and gentle speech.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS I shall entreat him</p>
<p>To answer like himself 430 : if Caesar move 431 him,</p>
<p>Let Antony look over Caesar’s head 432</p>
<p>And speak as loud as Mars 433 . By Jupiter 434 ,</p>
<p>Were I the wearer of Antonio’s beard,</p>
<p>I would not shave’t today 435 !</p>
<p>LEPIDUS ’Tis not a time for private stomaching 436 .</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Every time</p>
<p>Serves for the matter that is then born in’t.</p>
<p>LEPIDUS But small to greater matters must give way.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Not if the small come first.</p>
<p>LEPIDUS Your speech is passion:</p>
<p>But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes</p>
<p>The noble Antony.</p>
<p>Enter Antony and Ventidius</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS And yonder Caesar.</p>
<p>Enter Caesar, Maecenas and Agrippa</p>
<p>ANTONY If we compose 437 well here, to Parthia 438 .</p>
<p>Hark, Ventidius.</p>
<p>They converse apart</p>
<p>CAESAR I do not know, Maecenas, ask Agrippa 439 .</p>
<p>LEPIDUS Noble friends,</p>
<p>That which combined 440 us was most great, and let not</p>
<p>A leaner action rend us 441 . What’s 442 amiss,</p>
<p>May it be gently 443 heard. When we debate</p>
<p>Our trivial difference loud, we do commit</p>
<p>Murder in healing wounds 444 . Then, noble partners,</p>
<p>The rather for 445 I earnestly beseech,</p>
<p>Touch 446 you the sourest points with sweetest terms,</p>
<p>Nor curstness grow to th’matter 447 .</p>
<p>ANTONY ’Tis spoken well:</p>
<p>Were we before our armies, and to 448 fight,</p>
<p>I should do thus.</p>
<p>Flourish</p>
<p>CAESAR Welcome to Rome.</p>
<p>ANTONY Thank you.</p>
<p>CAESAR Sit.</p>
<p>ANTONY Sit, sir.</p>
<p>CAESAR Nay then 449 .</p>
<p>Caesar sits, then Antony</p>
<p>ANTONY I learn you take things ill which are not so,</p>
<p>Or being 450 , concern you not.</p>
<p>CAESAR I must be laughed at</p>
<p>If, or for nothing or 451 a little, I</p>
<p>Should say myself offended, and with you</p>
<p>Chiefly i’th’world 452 : more laughed at that I should</p>
<p>Once name you derogately 453 when to sound your name</p>
<p>It not concerned me 454 .</p>
<p>ANTONY My being in Egypt, Caesar,</p>
<p>What was’t to you?</p>
<p>CAESAR No more than my residing here at Rome</p>
<p>Might be to you in Egypt: yet if you there</p>
<p>Did practise on my state 455 , your being in Egypt</p>
<p>Might be my question 456 .</p>
<p>ANTONY How intend you 457 , ‘practised’?</p>
<p>CAESAR You may be pleased to catch at 458 mine intent</p>
<p>By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother</p>
<p>Made wars upon me, and their contestation 459</p>
<p>Was theme for you 460 : you were the word of war 461 .</p>
<p>ANTONY You do mistake your business. My brother never</p>
<p>Did urge me 462 in his act: I did inquire 463 it,</p>
<p>And have my learning 464 from some true reports 465</p>
<p>That drew their swords with you 466 . Did he not rather</p>
<p>Discredit my authority with 467 yours,</p>
<p>And make the wars alike against my stomach 468 ,</p>
<p>Having alike your cause 469 ? Of this my letters</p>
<p>Before did satisfy you. If you’ll patch 470 a quarrel,</p>
<p>As matter whole 471 you have to make it with,</p>
<p>It must not be with this.</p>
<p>CAESAR You praise yourself</p>
<p>By laying defects of judgement to me, but</p>
<p>You patched up your excuses.</p>
<p>ANTONY Not so, not so:</p>
<p>I know you could not lack, I am certain on’t,</p>
<p>Very necessity of this thought 472 , that I,</p>
<p>Your partner in the cause gainst which he 473 fought,</p>
<p>Could not with graceful 474 eyes attend those wars</p>
<p>Which fronted 475 mine own peace. As for my wife,</p>
<p>I would you had her spirit in such another 476 :</p>
<p>The third o’th’world is yours, which with a snaffle 477</p>
<p>You may pace 478 easy, but not such a wife.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to wars
with the women!</p>
<p>ANTONY So much uncurbable 479 , her garboils 480 , Caesar,</p>
<p>Made out of her impatience — which not wanted 481</p>
<p>Shrewdness of policy 482 too — I grieving grant 483</p>
<p>Did you too much disquiet. For that you must</p>
<p>But 484 say I could not help it.</p>
<p>CAESAR I wrote to you:</p>
<p>When rioting 485 in Alexandria you</p>
<p>Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts</p>
<p>Did gibe my missive out of audience 486 .</p>
<p>ANTONY Sir,</p>
<p>He fell upon me ere admitted 487 , then.</p>
<p>Three kings I had newly 488 feasted, and did want</p>
<p>Of what I was 489 i’th’morning. But next day</p>
<p>I told him of myself 490 , which was as much</p>
<p>As to have asked him pardon. Let this fellow</p>
<p>Be nothing 491 of our strife: if we contend 492 ,</p>
<p>Out of our question 493 wipe him.</p>
<p>CAESAR You have broken</p>
<p>The article 494 of your oath, which you shall never</p>
<p>Have tongue to charge me with.</p>
<p>LEPIDUS Soft 495 , Caesar!</p>
<p>ANTONY No, Lepidus, let him speak.</p>
<p>The honour is sacred which he talks on now,</p>
<p>Supposing 496 that I lacked it. But, on, Caesar:</p>
<p>The article of my oath—</p>
<p>CAESAR To lend me arms and aid when I required 497 them,</p>
<p>The which you both denied.</p>
<p>ANTONY Neglected rather:</p>
<p>And then when poisoned hours had bound me up</p>
<p>From mine own knowledge 498 . As nearly as I may,</p>
<p>I’ll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty</p>
<p>Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power</p>
<p>Work without it 499 . Truth is that Fulvia,</p>
<p>To have me out of Egypt, made wars here,</p>
<p>For which myself, the ignorant motive 500 , do</p>
<p>So far ask pardon as befits mine honour</p>
<p>To stoop in such a case.</p>
<p>LEPIDUS ’Tis noble spoken.</p>
<p>MAECENAS If it might please you to enforce no further</p>
<p>The griefs 501 between ye, to forget them quite 502</p>
<p>Were to remember that the present need</p>
<p>Speaks to atone 503 you.</p>
<p>LEPIDUS Worthily spoken, Maecenas.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Or, if you borrow one another’s love for the instant 504 ,
you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again: you
shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.</p>
<p>ANTONY Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS That truth should be silent, I had almost forgot.</p>
<p>ANTONY You wrong this presence 505 , therefore speak no more.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Go to, then! 506 You 507 considerate 508 stone.</p>
<p>CAESAR I do not much dislike the matter, but</p>
<p>The manner of his speech: for’t cannot be</p>
<p>We shall remain in friendship, our conditions 509</p>
<p>So diff’ring in their acts. Yet if I knew</p>
<p>What hoop should hold us staunch 510 , from edge to edge</p>
<p>O’th’world I would pursue it.</p>
<p>AGRIPPA Give me leave, Caesar.</p>
<p>CAESAR Speak, Agrippa.</p>
<p>AGRIPPA Thou hast a sister by the mother’s side 511 ,</p>
<p>Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony</p>
<p>Is now a widower.</p>
<p>CAESAR Say not so, Agrippa:</p>
<p>If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof</p>
<p>Were well deserved of rashness 512 .</p>
<p>ANTONY I am not married, Caesar: let me hear</p>
<p>Agrippa further speak.</p>
<p>AGRIPPA To hold you in perpetual amity 513 ,</p>
<p>To make you brothers and to knit your hearts</p>
<p>With an unslipping knot, take Antony</p>
<p>Octavia to his wife, whose beauty claims</p>
<p>No worse a husband than the best of men,</p>
<p>Whose virtue and whose general graces speak</p>
<p>That which none else can utter 514 . By this marriage</p>
<p>All little jealousies 515 which now seem great,</p>
<p>And all great fears which now import 516 their dangers</p>
<p>Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,</p>
<p>Where now half-tales be truths 517 . Her love to both 518</p>
<p>Would each to other, and all loves to both</p>
<p>Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,</p>
<p>For ’tis a studied, not a present 519 thought,</p>
<p>By duty ruminated.</p>
<p>ANTONY Will Caesar speak?</p>
<p>CAESAR Not till he hears how Antony is touched</p>
<p>With 520 what is spoke already.</p>
<p>ANTONY What power 521 is in Agrippa,</p>
<p>If I would 522 say, ‘Agrippa, be it so’,</p>
<p>To make this good?</p>
<p>CAESAR The power of Caesar, and</p>
<p>His power unto 523 Octavia.</p>
<p>ANTONY May I never,</p>
<p>To this good purpose that so fairly shows 524 ,</p>
<p>Dream of impediment 525 ! Let me have thy hand.</p>
<p>Further this act of grace 526 , and from this hour</p>
<p>The heart of brothers govern in our loves</p>
<p>And sway our great designs!</p>
<p>CAESAR There’s my hand:</p>
<p>They clasp hands</p>
<p>A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother</p>
<p>Did ever love so dearly. Let her live</p>
<p>To join our kingdoms and our hearts, and never</p>
<p>Fly off our loves again 527 !</p>
<p>LEPIDUS Happily, amen!</p>
<p>ANTONY I did not think to draw my sword gainst Pompey,</p>
<p>For he hath laid strange courtesies and great</p>
<p>Of late upon me 528 . I must thank him, only</p>
<p>Lest my remembrance 529 suffer ill report:</p>
<p>At heel of that, defy him 530 .</p>
<p>LEPIDUS Time calls upon’s.</p>
<p>Of 531 us must Pompey presently 532 be sought,</p>
<p>Or else he seeks out us.</p>
<p>ANTONY Where lies he?</p>
<p>CAESAR About the Mount Misena 533 .</p>
<p>ANTONY What is his strength by land?</p>
<p>CAESAR Great and increasing, but by sea</p>
<p>He is an absolute master.</p>
<p>ANTONY So is the fame 534 .</p>
<p>Would we had spoke together 535 ! Haste we for it.</p>
<p>Yet, ere 536 we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we 537</p>
<p>The business we have talked of.</p>
<p>CAESAR With most gladness,</p>
<p>And do invite you to my sister’s view 538 ,</p>
<p>Whither straight I’ll lead you.</p>
<p>ANTONY Let us, Lepidus, not lack your company.</p>
<p>LEPIDUS Noble Antony,</p>
<p>Not 539 sickness should detain me.</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt all. Enobarbus, Agrippa, Maecenas remain</p>
<p>MAECENAS Welcome from Egypt, sir.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Half the heart 540 of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My
honourable friend, Agrippa!</p>
<p>AGRIPPA Good Enobarbus!</p>
<p>MAECENAS We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested
541 . You stayed well by’t 542 in Egypt.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Ay, sir, we did sleep day out of countenance 543 and made
the night light 544 with drinking.</p>
<p>MAECENAS Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but 545
twelve persons there. Is this true?</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS This was but as a fly by 546 an eagle: we had much more
monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.</p>
<p>MAECENAS She’s a most triumphant 547 lady, if report be square 548 to
her.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed 549 up his heart
upon the river of Cydnus 550 .</p>
<p>AGRIPPA There she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised well for
her 551 .</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS I will tell you</p>
<p>The barge she sat in, like a burnished 552 throne,</p>
<p>Burned 553 on the water: the poop 554 was beaten gold,</p>
<p>Purple the sails, and so perfumèd that</p>
<p>The winds were lovesick with them: the oars were silver,</p>
<p>Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made</p>
<p>The water which they beat to follow faster,</p>
<p>As amorous of their strokes 555 . For her own person,</p>
<p>It beggared all description: she did lie</p>
<p>In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold of tissue 556 ,</p>
<p>O’er-picturing that Venus where we see</p>
<p>The fancy out-work nature 557 : on each side her 558</p>
<p>Stood pretty dimpled boys, like 559 smiling Cupid 560 s,</p>
<p>With divers-coloured 561 fans whose wind did seem</p>
<p>To glow 562 the delicate cheeks which they did cool,</p>
<p>And what they undid did.</p>
<p>AGRIPPA O, rare 563 for Antony!</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides 564 ,</p>
<p>So many mermaids, tended her i’th’eyes 565 ,</p>
<p>And made their bends adornings 566 . At the helm</p>
<p>A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle 567</p>
<p>Swell 568 with the touches of those flower-soft hands</p>
<p>That yarely frame the office 569 . From the barge</p>
<p>A strange invisible perfume hits the sense</p>
<p>Of the adjacent wharfs 570 . The city cast</p>
<p>Her people out upon her, and Antony,</p>
<p>Enthroned i’th’market-place, did sit alone,</p>
<p>Whistling to th’air, which, but for vacancy 571 ,</p>
<p>Had 572 gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,</p>
<p>And made a gap in nature.</p>
<p>AGRIPPA Rare Egyptian 573 !</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,</p>
<p>Invited her to supper: she replied</p>
<p>It should be better he became her guest,</p>
<p>Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,</p>
<p>Whom ne’er the word of ‘No’ woman heard speak,</p>
<p>Being barbered 574 ten times o’er, goes to the feast,</p>
<p>And for his ordinary 575 , pays his heart</p>
<p>For what his eyes eat only 576 .</p>
<p>AGRIPPA Royal wench 577 !</p>
<p>She made great Caesar 578 lay his sword to bed 579 .</p>
<p>He ploughed her, and she cropped 580 .</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS I saw her once</p>
<p>Hop forty paces through the public street</p>
<p>And, having lost her breath, she spoke and panted,</p>
<p>That 581 she did make defect perfection,</p>
<p>And, breathless, pour breath forth.</p>
<p>MAECENAS Now Antony must leave her utterly.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Never! He will not.</p>
<p>Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale 582</p>
<p>Her infinite variety: other women cloy</p>
<p>The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry</p>
<p>Where most she satisfies. For vilest things</p>
<p>Become themselves 583 in her, that the holy priests</p>
<p>Bless her when she is riggish 584 .</p>
<p>MAECENAS If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle</p>
<p>The heart of Antony, Octavia is</p>
<p>A blessèd lottery 585 to him.</p>
<p>AGRIPPA Let us go.</p>
<p>Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest</p>
<p>Whilst you abide here.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Humbly, sir, I thank you.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
