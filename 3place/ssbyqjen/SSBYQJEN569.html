The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra</h4>
<p>Antony and Cleopatra is Shakespeare’s most luxuriant tragedy. The
action sprawls around the Mediterranean world as it gives historical
form to the mythical encounter between Venus (the embodiment of love)
and Mars (the god of war). The play is structured upon a series of
oppositions: between female and male, desire and duty, the bed and the
battlefield, age and youth and, above all, Egypt and Rome.</p>
<p>Henry Cockeram’s English Dictionary , published in the same year as
Shakespeare’s First Folio, has an entry for Cleopatra: ‘an Egyptian
Queen, she was first beloved of Julius Caesar; after, Marcus Anthonius
was by her brought into such dotage that he aspired the Empire, which
caused his destruction’. The idea that a great lawgiver or warrior could
be destroyed by the lure of sexual desire was commonplace in the period.
An earlier dictionary reminded the reader of how King Solomon in the
Bible ‘exceeded all men in wisdom and knowledge’ but ‘nevertheless was
by dotage on women brought unto idolatry’. The primary definition of
‘dotage’ was ‘to be mad or peevish, to play the fool (as old folks do)’.
To dote was to go against reason; to fall too far in love was to lose
one’s wits. At the same time, the word was used with reference to old
age: senility atrophies the powers of reason and makes an old person
become a child again.</p>
<p>‘Nay, but this dotage of our general’s / O’erflows the measure’ says
a Roman soldier in the very opening line. From the Roman point of view
it is a monstrous embarrassment that one of the three men who rule their
great empire should be disporting himself like an infatuated teenager.
Perhaps he is indeed entering his dotage, approaching the second
childhood of old age. From the Egyptian point of view, the power of
desire is, on the contrary, something that transcends the petty world of
tribal politics. Antony is torn between the two worlds: one moment he
kisses Cleopatra and says ‘The nobleness of life / Is to do thus’, yet
the next he says ‘These strong Egyptian fetters I must break / Or lose
myself in dotage.’</p>
<p>Romanness meant controlling the passions within the restraint of
reason, but in Egypt love is imagined as something that neither can nor
should be controlled or measured. Its capacity is infinite. The love of
Antony and Cleopatra ‘finds out new earth, new heaven’. And love’s
medium is poetry: in this play Shakespeare gives his lyrical powers
freer rein than ever before or after. Though the opening lines are
spoken by a Roman, their style is loyal to Cleopatra: the sentence
overflows the measure of the pentameter line, preparing the way for the
liquid imagery of Egypt – with the fertile river Nile at its heart –
that will overcome the measured rigidity of Rome.</p>
<p>Against the grain of the Renaissance idealization of the age of
Augustus, Antony and Cleopatra depicts Octavius as a mealy-mouthed
pragmatist. The play is concerned less with the seismic shift from
republic to empire than with the transformation of Mark Antony from
military leader to slave of sexual desire: ‘Take but good note, and you
shall see in him / The triple pillar of the world transformed / Into a
strumpet’s fool.’ To Roman eyes, eros renders Antony undignified to the
point of risibility, but the sweep of the play’s poetic language, down
to its closing speech (‘No grave upon the earth shall clip in it / A
pair so famous’), celebrates the fame of the lovers, whose imagined
erotic union in death is symbolic of cosmic harmony. Octavius himself
has to admit that the dead Cleopatra looks as if ‘she would catch
another Antony / In her strong toil of grace’: ‘toil’ is sweatily
sexual, but ‘grace’ suggests that even the most Roman character of them
all is now seeing Antony and Cleopatra as something other than
self-deluding dotards. The aura of Cleopatra’s last speech is still
hanging in the air; the power of the poetic language has been such that
a sensitive listener will half-believe that Cleopatra has left her baser
elements and become all ‘fire and air’. She is, as Charmian so superbly
puts it, ‘A lass unparalleled’: just one of the girls, but also the
unique queen and serpent, embodiment of the Nile’s fertility and the
heat of life itself.</p>
<p>Although the ‘Life of Marcus Antonius’ shows more than usual interest
in the main female character, the historical structure of Plutarch’s
narratives is always premised on the lives of his male heroes.
Shakespeare’s play alters this focus to emphasize the death of the
woman, not that of the warrior, as the climax of the story. The female
perspective stands in opposition to the male voice that orders the march
of history. In tone and language Antony and Cleopatra may be described
as a ‘feminized’ classical tragedy: Egyptian cookery, luxuriant daybeds
and a billiard-playing eunuch contrast with the rigours of Roman
architecture and senatorial business.</p>
<p>At the end of the drama, young Octavius Caesar is left in sole charge
of the empire. He will become Augustus, who was regarded as the
embodiment of enlightened imperialism – a model for the ambitions of
Shakespeare’s patron, King James. But all the poetry of the play has
been on the Egyptian side. From Enobarbus’ entranced memory of the barge
at Cydnus to the final enrobing for the serpent’s kiss of death, the
language of Cleopatra works its magic upon the listener. Theatre’s power
to create illusion is of a piece with her seductive arts.</p>
<p>She is the consummate actress, able to change her mood on a whim, to
keep all around her guessing as to whether she is in earnest or at play.
Linguistically, she has a marvellous gift of combining a tone of
lightness and wonderment with a sexily down-to-earth robustness (‘O
happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!’). She is also the only woman
in Shakespeare’s tragedies to have a wit comparable to that of such
comic heroines as Rosalind in As You Like It and Portia in The Merchant
of Venice . ‘Can Fulvia die?’ she asks with feigned incredulity, playing
on the double entendre where to die meant to have an orgasm (Roman
wives, she implies, are frigid creatures). Cleopatra is a grown-up
Juliet: utterly confident in her body, she relishes her own sexuality
and is the dominant partner in the relationship. There is, however, a
darker side to her powers. She uses both her sexual allure and her regal
authority not only to seduce and to charm, but also to manipulate and to
emasculate. She savages the messenger who brings news she does not want
to hear. Her principal courtiers are women, Charmian and Iras. Plutarch
complained that the affairs of Antony’s entire empire were determined by
these two women of the bedchamber who frizzled Cleopatra’s hair and
dressed her head. The only men in her entourage are a eunuch, Mardian,
and a Greek, Alexas, whose name was synonymous with homoerotic
desire.</p>
<p>Historically, Cleopatra’s allegiance was to the Greek as opposed to
the Roman world. Her family, the Ptolemies, were Macedonian Greeks.
Though some modern productions have played with notions of her
blackness, imagining her as a kind of female Othello, Shakespeare’s
contemporaries did not regard her as black. George Abbott, who was born
within two years of Shakespeare, made the point explicitly in his Brief
Description of the Whole World wherein is particularly described all the
Monarchies, Empires, and Kingdoms of the same :</p>
<p>Although this country of Egypt doth stand in the self same climate
that Mauritania doth, yet the inhabitants there are not black, but
rather dun, or tawny. Of which colour Cleopatra was observed to be; who
by inticement, so won the love of Julius Caesar, and Antony. And of that
colour do those runagates (by devices make themselves to be) who go up
and down the world under the name of Egyptians, being indeed but
counterfeits and the refuse of rascality of many nations.</p>
<p>‘Tawny’ was an orange-brown colour, associated with the sun, but
clearly differentiated from the blackness of the Moors of Mauritania. It
was the colour of ‘gipsies’, who claimed to come from Egypt. Whereas
Iago insults Othello with racial abuse directed at his black features,
the Romans insult Cleopatra by calling her a gipsy, associating her with
a tribe famous for indolence, vagrancy, theft, fortune-telling and
verbal wiles, magic and counterfeiting – exactly the characteristic of
Shakespeare’s representation of Cleopatra’s court.</p>
<p>Gipsies were often associated with beggars, and part of the paradox
that is Cleopatra comes from the sense in which the opposite poles of
regality and beggary meet in her. Antony begins his journey with the
claim that ‘There’s beggary in the love that can be reckoned’, whilst
Cleopatra ends hers by recognizing that the dungy earth is both ‘The
beggar’s nurse and Caesar’s.’ Refusing to demean herself by begging in
supplication to Caesar, she welcomes the beggar-like Clown instead and
purchases the asp that she will nurse at her breast. It seems that her
main reason for refusing to surrender to Caesar is a refusal to undergo
the shame of public display: ‘scald rhymers’ will write ballads about
her and</p>
<p>… The quick comedians</p>
<p>Extemporally will stage us and present</p>
<p>Our Alexandrian revels: Antony</p>
<p>Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see</p>
<p>Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness</p>
<p>I’th’posture of a whore.</p>
<p>This is one of Shakespeare’s most daring self-allusions: he is the
scald rhymer, his actors the quick comedians extemporally staging the
revels. Antony has been ‘brought drunken forth’ in the person of Richard
Burbage, and the ‘squeaking Cleopatra’ who speaks these lines – in the
full knowledge that boy-actors were sometimes described as the players’
whores – is Burbage’s cross-dressed apprentice, a young man in his late
teens or at most his very early twenties (a sobering thought, given that
Cleopatra is now considered the supreme Shakespearean role for a mature
female actor).</p>
<p>We do not know what role, if any, Shakespeare wrote for himself in
Antony and Cleopatra . Probably a small one. But there is no doubt as to
which role corresponds most closely to his own point of view.
Shakespeare was a realist as well as a romantic, a skilled politician as
well as a supreme poet; he was equally capable of imagining Antony’s
dramatic trajectory as a rise and as a fall. He was perpetually both
inside and outside the action, both an emotionally involved participant
in the world he created and a wryly detached commentator upon it. In the
play, his own perspective is that of an Egyptian in Rome and a Roman in
Egypt, as in earlier life his viewpoint had been that of a country
outsider in London. So he invented a new character, the only major
player in the story who is absent from the historical source: Enobarbus.
Intelligent, funny, at once companionable and guardedly isolated, full
of understanding and admiration for women but most comfortable among men
(there is a homoerotic frisson to his bond with Menas and his rivalry
with Agrippa), clinically analytical in his assessment of others but
full of sorrow and shame when his reason overrides his loyalty and leads
him to desert his friend and master, Enobarbus is as rewarding a role as
any Shakespeare wrote. And it might just be the nearest thing anywhere
in his complete works to a considered self-portrait.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Following the assassination of Julius Caesar and the battle of
Philippi, Mark Antony, Octavius Caesar and Lepidus are the joint rulers
of the known world. Antony, however, is captivated by Cleopatra, Queen
of Egypt, and neglects his responsibilities to spend time with her in
Alexandria. This scandal is the talk of Rome and creates a rift between
Antony and young Octavius Caesar. News comes from Rome that Antony’s
wife is dead. More urgently, the power of the triumvirate is being
challenged by Pompey. Antony is forced to return to Rome and resume his
responsibilities. When it is suggested that he should cement the
alliance with Octavius by marrying his sister, Octavia, Antony agrees.
Back in Egypt, the news of Antony’s marriage sends Cleopatra into a
jealous tirade. On the brink of war, Antony and Octavius make peace with
Pompey. Shortly afterwards, however, Antony learns that not only has
Octavius attacked Pompey after all, but he has also spoken scornfully of
Antony in public and has had Lepidus imprisoned on dubious charges.
Antony sends Octavia back to negotiate with her brother while he returns
secretly to Alexandria. News arrives in Rome that Antony and Cleopatra
have crowned themselves and their children kings and queens in
Alexandria. Octavius declares war on Egypt. The Egyptian forces lose the
sea-battle of Actium when Antony deserts the battle to follow
Cleopatra’s fleeing ship. Antony is consumed with shame and despair.
However, hearing that Octavius has offered to make a secret treaty with
Cleopatra, he rouses himself for a second, victorious battle. On the eve
of the third battle, Antony’s soldiers are nervous and fear bad omens.
Even the faithful Enobarbus deserts him. The Egyptian fleet surrenders
and Antony, in his fury, accuses Cleopatra of betraying him to Octavius.
She retreats from his anger to her monument and sends a false report
that she is dead. On hearing this, Antony attempts suicide and is
brought to Cleopatra’s monument to die in her arms. Rather than be
captured and enslaved by the Romans, Cleopatra also kills herself. With
all his enemies eliminated, Octavius returns victorious to Rome.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Mark Antony (24%/ 202/22), Cleopatra (19%/204/16), Octavius
Caesar (12%/98/14), Enobarbus (10%/113/12), Pompey (4%/41/3), Charmian
(3%/63/10), Lepidus (2%/30/6), Menas (2%/35/3), Agrippa (2%/28/7),
Dolabella (1%/23/3), Eros (1%/27/6), Scarrus (1%/12/4).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 95% verse, 5% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: 1606–07. Perhaps performed at court Christmas 1606 or Christmas
1607. Registered for publication in May 1608 (though not actually
published prior to the First Folio); it seems to have influenced a play
by Barnabe Barnes that was performed and published in 1607.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Closely based on the ‘Life of Marcus Antonius’ in Plutarch’s
Lives of the Most Noble Grecians and Romanes , translated by Thomas
North (1579); there are some exceptionally close verbal parallels. The
main addition is the character of Enobarbus, who is only mentioned very
briefly in Plutarch. Shakespeare also seems to have known Samuel
Daniel’s Cleopatra (1594, a play written to be read rather than
performed); Daniel, in turn, seems to have been influenced by
Shakespeare when revising his play in 1607.</p>
<p>TEXT: The First Folio of 1623 is the only early text. Apparently set
from a scribal transcript of Shakespeare’s manuscript, it is notably
inconsistent in the spelling of proper names and has a plethora of minor
errors but few major ones.</p>
