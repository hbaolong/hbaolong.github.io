<h4 id="scene-1-3-running-scene-1">Scene 1 3 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter Ferdinand 4 King of Navarre, Berowne, Longaville 5 and Dumaine
6</p>
<p>KING Let fame 7 , that all hunt after in their lives,</p>
<p>Live registered 8 upon our brazen 9 tombs,</p>
<p>And then grace 10 us in the disgrace 11 of death</p>
<p>When, spite 12 of cormorant 13 devouring time,</p>
<p>Th’endeavour of this present breath 14 may buy</p>
<p>That honour which shall bate 15 his 16 scythe’s keen 17 edge</p>
<p>And make us heirs of all eternity.</p>
<p>Therefore, brave conquerors — for so you are,</p>
<p>That war against your own affections 18</p>
<p>And the huge army of the world’s desires —</p>
<p>Our late 19 edict shall strongly stand in force 20 .</p>
<p>Navarre 21 shall be the wonder of the world,</p>
<p>Our court shall be a little academe 22 ,</p>
<p>Still and contemplative in 23 24 living art 25 .</p>
<p>You three, Berowne, Dumaine and Longaville,</p>
<p>Have sworn for three years’ term 26 to live with me,</p>
<p>My fellow-scholars, and to keep 27 those statutes</p>
<p>That are recorded in this schedule 28 here.</p>
<p>Shows a paper</p>
<p>Your oaths are passed 29 , and now subscribe 30 your names,</p>
<p>That his own hand 31 may strike his honour down</p>
<p>That violates the smallest branch 32 herein.</p>
<p>If you are armed 33 to do as sworn to do,</p>
<p>Subscribe to your deep 34 oaths, and keep it 35 too.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE I am resolved: ‘tis but a three years’ fast.</p>
<p>The mind shall banquet though the body pine 36 .</p>
<p>Signs</p>
<p>Fat paunches have lean pates 37 , and dainty bits 38</p>
<p>Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.</p>
<p>DUMAINE My loving lord, Dumaine is mortified 39 .</p>
<p>The grosser 40 manner of these world’s delights</p>
<p>He throws upon the gross 41 world’s baser slaves 42 .</p>
<p>Signs</p>
<p>To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,</p>
<p>With all these living in 43 philosophy.</p>
<p>BEROWNE I can but say their protestation over 44 .</p>
<p>So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,</p>
<p>That is, to live and study here three years.</p>
<p>But there are other strict observances 45 ,</p>
<p>As 46 not to see a woman in that term,</p>
<p>Which I hope well is not enrollèd 47 there.</p>
<p>And one day in a week to touch no food,</p>
<p>And but one meal on every day beside,</p>
<p>The which I hope is not enrollèd there.</p>
<p>And then to sleep but three hours in the night,</p>
<p>And not be seen to wink 48 of all the day —</p>
<p>When I was wont 49 to think no harm 50 all night</p>
<p>And make a dark night too of half the day —</p>
<p>Which I hope well is not enrollèd there.</p>
<p>O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep:</p>
<p>Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep.</p>
<p>KING Your oath is passed to pass away from 51 these.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Let me say no, my liege, an if 52 you please.</p>
<p>I only swore to study with your grace</p>
<p>And stay here in your court for three years’ space 53 .</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.</p>
<p>BEROWNE By yea and nay 54 , sir, then I swore in jest.</p>
<p>What is the end 55 of study, let me know?</p>
<p>KING Why, that to know which else we should not know.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Things hid and barred, you mean, from common sense 56 ?</p>
<p>KING Ay, that is study’s godlike recompense 57 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE Come on 58 then, I will swear to study so,</p>
<p>To know the thing I am forbid to know:</p>
<p>As thus, to study where I well may dine,</p>
<p>When I to feast expressly am forbid.</p>
<p>Or study where to meet some mistress fine,</p>
<p>When mistresses from common sense are hid.</p>
<p>Or, having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath 59 ,</p>
<p>Study to break it and not break my troth 60 .</p>
<p>If study’s gain be thus and this be so,</p>
<p>Study knows that which yet it doth not know.</p>
<p>Swear me to this, and I will ne’er say no.</p>
<p>KING These be the stops 61 that hinder study quite 62</p>
<p>And train 63 our intellects to vain 64 delight.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Why, all delights are vain, and that most vain,</p>
<p>Which with pain 65 purchased 66 doth inherit 67 pain:</p>
<p>As 68 painfully to pore upon a book</p>
<p>To seek the light of truth, while 69 truth the while</p>
<p>Doth falsely 70 blind the eyesight of his look 71 .</p>
<p>Light 72 seeking light 73 doth light of light beguile 74 :</p>
<p>So, ere 75 you find where light in darkness 76 lies,</p>
<p>Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.</p>
<p>Study me 77 how to please the eye indeed</p>
<p>By fixing it upon a fairer 78 eye,</p>
<p>Who dazzling 79 so, that eye 80 shall be his heed 81</p>
<p>And give him light that it was blinded by.</p>
<p>Study is like the heaven’s glorious sun</p>
<p>That will not be deep-searched with saucy 82 looks:</p>
<p>Small 83 have continual plodders ever won</p>
<p>Save 84 base 85 authority from others’ books.</p>
<p>These earthly godfathers of heaven’s lights 86 ,</p>
<p>That give a name to every fixèd star,</p>
<p>Have no more profit of 87 their shining 88 nights</p>
<p>Than those that walk and wot 89 not what they 90 are.</p>
<p>Too much to know is to know nought but fame 91 ,</p>
<p>And every godfather 92 can give a name.</p>
<p>KING How well he’s read, to reason against reading.</p>
<p>DUMAINE Proceeded 93 well, to stop all good proceeding 94 .</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE He weeds 95 the corn, and still lets grow the weeding 96
.</p>
<p>BEROWNE The spring is near when green geese 97 are a-breeding.</p>
<p>DUMAINE How follows that?</p>
<p>BEROWNE Fit in his 98 place and time.</p>
<p>DUMAINE In reason nothing 99 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE Something then in rhyme 100 .</p>
<p>KING Berowne is like an envious 101 sneaping 102 frost</p>
<p>That bites the first-born infants 103 of the spring.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Well, say I am. Why should proud 104 summer boast</p>
<p>Before the birds have any cause to sing?</p>
<p>Why should I joy in any abortive 105 birth?</p>
<p>At Christmas I no more desire a rose</p>
<p>Than wish a snow in May’s new-fangled shows 106 ,</p>
<p>But like of 107 each thing that in season 108 grows.</p>
<p>So you, to study now it is too late 109 ,</p>
<p>That were to climb o’er the house to unlock the gate 110 .</p>
<p>KING Well, sit you out 111 . Go home, Berowne, adieu.</p>
<p>BEROWNE No, my good lord, I have sworn to stay with you.</p>
<p>And though I have for barbarism 112 spoke more</p>
<p>Than for that angel knowledge you can say,</p>
<p>Yet confident I’ll keep what I have sworn</p>
<p>And bide 113 the penance of each three years’ day 114 .</p>
<p>Give me the paper, let me read the same,</p>
<p>And to the strict’st decrees I’ll write my name.</p>
<p>Takes the paper</p>
<p>KING How well this yielding rescues thee from shame.</p>
<p>BEROWNE ‘Item , That no woman shall come within a mile of my court.’
Hath this been proclaimed?</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE Four days ago.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Let’s see the penalty: ‘On pain of losing her tongue.’ Who
devised this penalty?</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE Marry 115 , that did I.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Sweet lord, and why?</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE To fright them hence 116 with that dread 117 penalty.</p>
<p>BEROWNE A dangerous law against gentility 118 !</p>
<p>‘Item , If any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of
three years, he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court
shall possibly devise.’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>This article 119 , my liege, yourself must break,</p>
<p>For well you know here comes in embassy 120</p>
<p>The French king’s daughter with yourself to speak —</p>
<p>A maid of grace and complete 121 majesty —</p>
<p>About surrender up of Aquitaine 122</p>
<p>To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:</p>
<p>Therefore this article is made in vain,</p>
<p>Or vainly 123 comes th’admirèd princess hither.</p>
<p>KING What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.</p>
<p>BEROWNE So study evermore is overshot 124 .</p>
<p>While it doth study to have what it would 125 ,</p>
<p>It doth forget to do the thing it should:</p>
<p>And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,</p>
<p>’Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost 126 .</p>
<p>KING We must of force 127 dispense with this decree.</p>
<p>She must lie 128 here on mere 129 necessity.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Necessity will make us all forsworn 130</p>
<p>Three thousand times within this three years’ space,</p>
<p>For every man with his affects 131 is born,</p>
<p>Not by might 132 mastered but by special grace 133 .</p>
<p>If I break faith, this word 134 shall speak for me:</p>
<p>I am forsworn ‘on mere necessity’.</p>
<p>So to the laws at large 135 I write my name,</p>
<p>Signs</p>
<p>And he that breaks them in the least degree</p>
<p>Stands in attainder 136 of eternal shame.</p>
<p>Suggestions are to others as to me 137 :</p>
<p>But I believe, although I seem so loath,</p>
<p>I am the last that will last keep his oath 138 .</p>
<p>But is there no quick 139 recreation granted?</p>
<p>KING Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted</p>
<p>With 140 a refinèd traveller of Spain,</p>
<p>A man in all the world’s new fashion planted 141 ,</p>
<p>That hath a mint 142 of phrases in his brain,</p>
<p>One who the music of his own vain tongue</p>
<p>Doth ravish like enchanting harmony,</p>
<p>A man of compliments 143 , whom right and wrong</p>
<p>Have chose as umpire of their mutiny 144 .</p>
<p>This child of fancy 145 , that Armado hight 146 ,</p>
<p>For interim 147 to our studies shall relate</p>
<p>In high-born 148 words the worth of many a knight</p>
<p>From tawny 149 Spain lost in the world’s debate 150 .</p>
<p>How you delight 151 , my lords, I know not, I,</p>
<p>But I protest I love to hear him lie,</p>
<p>And I will use him for my minstrelsy 152 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE Armado is a most illustrious wight 153 ,</p>
<p>A man of fire-new words, fashion’s own knight.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE Costard 154 the swain 155 and he 156 shall be our sport
157 ,</p>
<p>And so to study three years is but short.</p>
<p>Enter a constable [Dull ] with a letter, with Costard</p>
<p>DULL Which is the duke’s 158 own person?</p>
<p>BEROWNE This, fellow. What wouldst?</p>
<p>DULL I myself reprehend 159 his own person, for I am his grace’s
tharborough 160 . But I would see his own person in flesh and blood.</p>
<p>BEROWNE This is he.</p>
<p>DULL Signior Arme … Arme … commends you 161 . There’s villainy abroad
162 .</p>
<p>This letter will tell you more.</p>
<p>Shows a letter</p>
<p>COSTARD Sir, the contempts 163 thereof are as touching 164 me.</p>
<p>KING A letter from the magnificent 165 Armado.</p>
<p>BEROWNE How low soever the matter 166 , I hope in God for high 167
words.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE A high hope 168 for a low heaven 169 . God grant us
patience.</p>
<p>BEROWNE To hear, or forbear 170 hearing?</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately, or to
forbear both.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Well, sir, be it 171 as the style 172 shall give us cause to
climb in the merriness.</p>
<p>COSTARD The matter is to 173 me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta. The
manner 174 of it is, I was taken with the manner 175 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE In what manner?</p>
<p>COSTARD In manner and form following 176 , sir, all those three 177 .
I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with her upon the form
178 , and taken following her into the park 179 , which, put together,
is ‘in manner 180 and form following’. Now, sir, for the manner: it is
the manner of a man to speak to a woman. For the form: in some form.</p>
<p>BEROWNE For the ‘following’, sir?</p>
<p>COSTARD As it shall follow in my correction 181 , and God defend the
right 182 !</p>
<p>KING Will you hear this letter with attention?</p>
<p>BEROWNE As we would hear an oracle.</p>
<p>COSTARD Such is the simplicity 183 of man to hearken after the
flesh.</p>
<p>KING ‘Great deputy, the welkin’s 184 vicegerent 185 and sole
dominator 186 of Navarre, my soul’s earth’s god, and body’s fostering
187 patron’—</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>COSTARD Not a word of Costard yet.</p>
<p>KING ‘So it is’—</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>COSTARD It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in telling true,
but so 188 .</p>
<p>KING Peace!</p>
<p>COSTARD Be 189 to me and every man that dares not fight.</p>
<p>KING No words!</p>
<p>COSTARD Of other men’s secrets 190 , I beseech you.</p>
<p>KING ‘So it is, besieged with sable-coloured 191 melancholy, I did
commend 192 the black oppressing humour 193 194 to the most wholesome
physic 195 of thy health-giving air, and, as I am 196 a gentleman,
betook myself to walk. The time, when? About the sixth hour, when beasts
most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down to that nourishment which
is called supper: so much for the time when. Now for the ground, which?
Which, I mean, I walked upon. It is ycleped 197 thy park. Then for the
place, where? Where, I mean, I did encounter that obscene 198 and most
preposterous 199 event that draweth from my snow-white pen 200 the
ebon-coloured 201 ink, which here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or
seest. But to the place, where? It standeth north-north-east and by east
from the west corner of thy curious-knotted 202 garden; there did I see
that low-spirited 203 swain, that base minnow of thy mirth 204’—</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>COSTARD Me?</p>
<p>KING ‘That unlettered 205 small-knowing soul’—</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>COSTARD Me?</p>
<p>KING ‘That shallow vassal 206’—</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>COSTARD Still me?</p>
<p>KING ‘Which, as I remember, hight Costard’—</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>COSTARD O, me!</p>
<p>KING ‘Sorted 207 and consorted 208 , contrary to thy established
proclaimed edict and continent canon 209 , which with — O, with — but
with this I passion 210 to say wherewith 211’—</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>COSTARD With a wench.</p>
<p>KING ‘With a child of our grandmother Eve, a female, or, for thy more
sweet understanding, a woman. Him I (as my ever-esteemed duty pricks 212
me on) have sent to thee, to receive the meed 213 of punishment, by thy
sweet grace’s officer, Anthony Dull, a man of good repute, carriage 214
, bearing, and estimation 215 .’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>DULL Me, an’t 216 shall please you. I am Anthony Dull.</p>
<p>KING ‘For Jaquenetta—so is the weaker vessel 217 called which I
apprehended with the aforesaid swain — I keep 218 her as a vessel of the
law’s fury, and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice 219 , bring her
to trial 220 . Thine, in all compliments of devoted and heart-burning
heat of duty. Don Adriano de Armado.’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>BEROWNE This is not so well as I looked for 221 , but the best that
ever I heard.</p>
<p>KING Ay, the best for 222 the worst. But, sirrah 223 , what say you
to this?</p>
<p>COSTARD Sir, I confess 224 the wench.</p>
<p>KING Did you hear the proclamation?</p>
<p>COSTARD I do confess much of the hearing it but little of the marking
of 225 it.</p>
<p>KING It was proclaimed a year’s imprisonment to be taken with a
wench.</p>
<p>COSTARD I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.</p>
<p>KING Well, it was proclaimed damsel.</p>
<p>COSTARD This was no damsel, neither, sir: she was a virgin.</p>
<p>KING It is so varied 226 too, for it was proclaimed virgin.</p>
<p>COSTARD If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a
maid.</p>
<p>KING This maid 227 will not serve your turn 228 , sir.</p>
<p>COSTARD This maid will serve my turn, sir.</p>
<p>KING Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast a week with
bran and water.</p>
<p>COSTARD I had rather pray 229 a month with mutton and porridge 230
.</p>
<p>KING And Don Armado shall be your keeper.</p>
<p>My Lord Berowne, see him delivered o’er 231 :</p>
<p>And go we, lords, to put in practice that</p>
<p>Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.</p>
<p>[Exeunt King, Longaville and Dumaine ]</p>
<p>BEROWNE I’ll lay 232 my head to any goodman 233 ’s hat,</p>
<p>These oaths and laws will prove an idle 234 scorn.</p>
<p>Sirrah, come on.</p>
<p>COSTARD I suffer for the truth, sir, for true 235 it is, I was taken
with Jaquenetta, and</p>
<p>Jaquenetta is a true girl. And therefore welcome the sour cup of
prosperity 236 !</p>
<p>Affliction 237 may one day smile again, and until then, sit down 238
, sorrow!</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
