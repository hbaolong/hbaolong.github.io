18</h4>
<p>Flourish. Enter Bullingbrook, York, with other Lords and
Attendants</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear</p>
<p>Is that the rebels have consumed with fire</p>
<p>Our town of Cicester 1353 in Gloucestershire,</p>
<p>But whether they be ta’en 1354 or slain we hear not.</p>
<p>Enter Northumberland</p>
<p>Welcome, my lord. What is the news?</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.</p>
<p>The next 1355 news is, I have to London sent</p>
<p>The heads of Salisbury, Spencer, Blunt and Kent.</p>
<p>The manner of their taking 1356 may appear</p>
<p>At large discoursèd 1357 in this paper here.</p>
<p>Gives a paper</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains,</p>
<p>And to thy worth will add right worthy 1358 gains.</p>
<p>Enter Fitzwaters</p>
<p>FITZWATERS My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London</p>
<p>The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,</p>
<p>Two of the dangerous consorted traitors</p>
<p>That sought at Oxford thy dire 1359 overthrow.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Thy pains, Fitzwaters, shall not be forgot.</p>
<p>Right noble is thy merit, well I wot 1360 .</p>
<p>Enter Percy and Carlisle</p>
<p>PERCY The grand 1361 conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,</p>
<p>With clog 1362 of conscience and sour melancholy</p>
<p>Hath yielded up his body to the grave,</p>
<p>But here is Carlisle living, to abide 1363</p>
<p>Thy kingly doom 1364 and sentence of his pride.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Carlisle, this is your doom:</p>
<p>Choose out some secret place, some reverend room 1365 ,</p>
<p>More 1366 than thou hast, and with it joy 1367 thy life.</p>
<p>So as thou liv’st in peace, die free from strife:</p>
<p>For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,</p>
<p>High 1368 sparks of honour in thee have I seen.</p>
<p>Enter Exton, with [Attendants carrying ] a coffin</p>
<p>EXTON Great king, within this coffin I present</p>
<p>Thy buried fear. Herein all breathless lies</p>
<p>The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,</p>
<p>Richard of Bordeaux 1369 , by me hither brought.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Exton, I thank thee not, for thou hast wrought 1370</p>
<p>A deed of slaughter with thy fatal hand</p>
<p>Upon my head and all this famous land.</p>
<p>EXTON From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK They love not poison that do poison need,</p>
<p>Nor do I thee. Though I did wish him dead,</p>
<p>I hate the murd’rer, love him murderèd 1371 .</p>
<p>The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,</p>
<p>But neither my good word nor princely favour.</p>
<p>With Cain 1372 go wander through the shade of night,</p>
<p>And never show thy head by day nor light.</p>
<p>Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe</p>
<p>That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow.</p>
<p>Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,</p>
<p>And put on sullen 1373 1374 black incontinent.</p>
<p>I’ll make a voyage to the Holy Land 1375 ,</p>
<p>To wash this blood off from my guilty hand.</p>
<p>March sadly 1376 after: grace 1377 my mourning here,</p>
<p>In weeping after 1378 this untimely bier 1379 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Quarto passages that do not appear in the Folio</p>
<p>Following 1.3 here :</p>
<p>And for we think the eagle-wingèd pride</p>
<p>Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,</p>
<p>With rival-hating envy, set on you</p>
<p>To wake our peace, which in our country’s cradle</p>
<p>Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;</p>
<p>Following 1.3 here :</p>
<p>O, had it been a stranger, not my child,</p>
<p>To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:</p>
<p>A partial slander sought I to avoid,</p>
<p>And in the sentence my own life destroyed.</p>
<p>Following 1.3 here :</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make</p>
<p>Will but remember me what a deal of world</p>
<p>I wander from the jewels that I love.</p>
<p>Must I not serve a long apprenticehood</p>
<p>To foreign passages, and in the end,</p>
<p>Having my freedom, boast of nothing else</p>
<p>But that I was a journeyman to grief?</p>
<p>GAUNT All places that the eye of heaven visits</p>
<p>Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.</p>
<p>Teach thy necessity to reason thus;</p>
<p>There is no virtue like necessity.</p>
<p>Think not the king did banish thee,</p>
<p>But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,</p>
<p>Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.</p>
<p>Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour</p>
<p>And not the king exiled thee; or suppose</p>
<p>Devouring pestilence hangs in our air</p>
<p>And thou art flying to a fresher clime:</p>
<p>Look what thy soul holds dear, imagine it</p>
<p>To lie that way thou go’st, not whence thou comest:</p>
<p>Suppose the singing birds musicians,</p>
<p>The grass whereon thou tread’st the presence strewed,</p>
<p>The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more</p>
<p>Than a delightful measure or a dance;</p>
<p>For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite</p>
<p>The man that mocks at it and sets it light.</p>
<p>Following 3.2 here :</p>
<p>The means that heaven yields must be embraced,</p>
<p>And not neglected; else, if heaven would,</p>
<p>And we will not, heaven’s offer we refuse,</p>
<p>The proffered means of succour and redress.</p>
<p>Following 4.1 here :</p>
<p>LORD I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;</p>
<p>And spur thee on with full as many lies</p>
<p>As may be holloaed in thy treacherous ear</p>
<p>From sun to sun: there is my honour’s pawn;</p>
<p>Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.</p>
<p>AUMERLE Who sets me else? By heaven, I’ll throw at all:</p>
<p>I have a thousand spirits in one breast,</p>
<p>To answer twenty thousand such as you.</p>

<p>NOTES</p>
<p>1 List of parts QUEEN unnamed on stage; the historical Richard’s wife

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster , and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading ‘bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
<p>“This new Complete Works from the RSC is a glorious edition of one of
the world’s most important books. It’s the essential reference book for
anyone who’s ever been in love, felt jealousy, fear, hatred, or desire.
All human life is here - and every home should have one.“</p>
