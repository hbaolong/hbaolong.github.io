<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-2-94">Scene 2 ／ running scene 2 94</h4>
<p>Enter Rosalind and Celia</p>
<p>CELIA I pray thee Rosalind, sweet my coz 95 , be merry.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and
would 96 you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a
banished father, you must not learn 97 me how to remember any
extraordinary pleasure.</p>
<p>CELIA Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight that I
love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the
duke my father, so 98 thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught
my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst thou, if the truth of
thy love to me were so righteously tempered 99 as mine is to thee.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Well, I will forget the condition of my estate 100 , to
rejoice in yours.</p>
<p>CELIA You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like 101 to
have; and truly, when he dies, thou shalt be his heir; for what he hath
taken away from thy father perforce 102 , I will render thee again in
affection. By mine honour, I will, and when I break that oath, let me
turn monster: therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.</p>
<p>ROSALIND From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports 103 . Let me
see, what think you of falling in love?</p>
<p>CELIA Marry, I prithee do, to make sport 104 withal 105 : but love no
man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety of
a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again 106 .</p>
<p>ROSALIND What shall be our sport, then?</p>
<p>CELIA Let us sit and mock the good housewife 107 Fortune from her
wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.</p>
<p>ROSALIND I would we could do so, for her benefits are mightily
misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman 108 doth most mistake in her
gifts to women.</p>
<p>CELIA ’Tis true, for those that she makes fair 109 she scarce makes
honest 110 , and those that she makes honest she makes very
ill-favouredly 111 .</p>
<p>ROSALIND Nay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office 112 to Nature’s:
Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments 113 of
Nature.</p>
<p>Enter Clown [Touchstone 114 ]</p>
<p>CELIA No? When Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by
Fortune fall into the fire 115 ? Though Nature hath given us wit 116 to
flout at 117 Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool 118 to cut off
the argument?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when Fortune
makes Nature’s natural 119 the cutter-off of Nature’s wit.</p>
<p>CELIA Peradventure 120 this is not Fortune’s work neither, but
Nature’s, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such
goddesses, hath sent this natural for our whetstone 121 , for always the
dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.— How now, wit?
Whither wander you 122 ?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Mistress, you must come away to your father.</p>
<p>CELIA Were you made the messenger 123 ?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Where learned you that oath, fool?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were
good pancakes 124 , and swore by his honour the mustard was naught 125 :
now I’ll stand to 126 it, the pancakes were naught, and the mustard was
good, and yet was not the knight forsworn 127 .</p>
<p>CELIA How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear by
your beards that I am a knave.</p>
<p>CELIA By our beards, if we had them, thou art.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE By my knavery, if I had it, then I were, but if you swear
by that that is not, you are not forsworn. No more was this knight
swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he had, he had sworn
it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.</p>
<p>CELIA Prithee, who is’t that thou meanest?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE One that old Frederick, your father, loves.</p>
<p>CELIA My father’s love is enough to honour him enough; speak no more
of him, you’ll be whipped for taxation 128 one of these days.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
men do foolishly.</p>
<p>CELIA By my troth 129 , thou sayest true, for since the little wit
that fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have
makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur the Beau.</p>
<p>Enter Le Beau 130</p>
<p>ROSALIND With his mouth full of news.</p>
<p>CELIA Which he will put 131 on us, as pigeons feed their young.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Then shall we be news-crammed.</p>
<p>CELIA All the better: we shall be the more marketable 132 .—</p>
<p>Bonjour , Monsieur Le Beau, what’s the news?</p>
<p>LE BEAU Fair princess, you have lost 133 much good sport.</p>
<p>CELIA Sport? Of what colour 134 ?</p>
<p>LE BEAU What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?</p>
<p>ROSALIND As wit and fortune will.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Or as the destinies decrees.</p>
<p>Imitates Le Beau</p>
<p>CELIA Well said, that was laid on with a trowel 135 .</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Nay, if I keep not my rank 136 —</p>
<p>ROSALIND Thou losest 137 thy old 138 smell.</p>
<p>LE BEAU You amaze 139 me, ladies. I would have told you of good
wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.</p>
<p>LE BEAU I will tell you the beginning, and if it please your
ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is yet to do 140 : and
here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.</p>
<p>CELIA Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.</p>
<p>LE BEAU There comes an old man and his three sons—</p>
<p>CELIA I could match this beginning with an old tale 141 .</p>
<p>LE BEAU Three proper 142 young men, of excellent growth and
presence.</p>
<p>ROSALIND With bills 143 on their necks, ‘Be it known unto all men by
these presents 144 .’</p>
<p>LE BEAU The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the duke’s
wrestler, which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his
ribs, that 145 there is little hope of life in him. So 146 he served the
second, and so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man, their
father, making such pitiful dole 147 over them that all the beholders
take his part with weeping.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Alas!</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have
lost?</p>
<p>LE BEAU Why, this that I speak of.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time
that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.</p>
<p>CELIA Or I, I promise thee.</p>
<p>ROSALIND But is there any 148 else longs to see this broken 149 music
in his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we see
this wrestling, cousin?</p>
<p>LE BEAU You must if you stay here, for here is the place appointed
for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.</p>
<p>CELIA Yonder, sure they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.</p>
<p>Flourish 150 . Enter Duke [Frederick ] , Lords, Orlando, Charles and
Attendants</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK Come on. Since the youth will not be entreated, his
own peril on his forwardness 151 .</p>
<p>ROSALIND Is yonder the man?</p>
<p>To Le Beau</p>
<p>LE BEAU Even he, madam.</p>
<p>CELIA Alas, he is too young, yet he looks successfully 152 .</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK How now, daughter and cousin 153 !</p>
<p>Are you crept hither to see the wrestling?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave 154 .</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK You will take little delight in it, I can tell you,
there is such odds 155 in the man 156 . In pity of the challenger’s
youth, I would fain 157 dissuade him, but he will not be entreated.
Speak to him, ladies, see if you can move him.</p>
<p>CELIA Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK Do so. I’ll not be by.</p>
<p>He stands aside</p>
<p>LE BEAU Monsieur the challenger, the princess calls for you.</p>
<p>To Orlando</p>
<p>ORLANDO I attend them with all respect and duty.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?</p>
<p>ORLANDO No, fair princess, he is the general challenger: I come but
in 158 , as others do, to try 159 with him the strength of my youth.</p>
<p>CELIA Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years. You
have seen cruel proof of this man’s strength: if you saw yourself with
your eyes or knew yourself with your judgement, the fear of your
adventure 160 would counsel you to a more equal 161 enterprise. We pray
you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this
attempt.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Do, young sir: your reputation shall not therefore be
misprized 162 . We will make it our suit 163 to the duke that the
wrestling might not go forward.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, wherein
I confess me much guilty, to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything.
But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial; wherein
if I be foiled 164 , there is but one shamed that was never gracious 165
, if killed, but one dead that is willing to be so. I shall do my
friends 166 no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the world no injury,
for in it I have nothing. Only in the world I fill up a place, which may
be better supplied when I have made it empty.</p>
<p>ROSALIND The little strength that I have, I would it were with
you.</p>
<p>CELIA And mine, to eke out 167 hers.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived 168 in you!</p>
<p>CELIA Your heart’s desires be with you!</p>
<p>CHARLES Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie
with his mother earth 169 ?</p>
<p>ORLANDO Ready, sir, but his will 170 hath in it a more modest working
171 .</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK You shall try but one fall 172 .</p>
<p>CHARLES No, I warrant 173 your grace you shall not entreat him to a
second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.</p>
<p>ORLANDO You mean to mock me after, you should not have mocked me
before. But come your ways 174 .</p>
<p>ROSALIND Now Hercules 175 be thy speed 176 , young man!</p>
<p>CELIA I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the
leg.</p>
<p>Wrestle</p>
<p>ROSALIND O excellent young man!</p>
<p>CELIA If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should down
177 .</p>
<p>Shout Charles is thrown</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK No more, no more.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Yes, I beseech your grace:</p>
<p>I am not yet well breathed 178 .</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK How dost thou, Charles?</p>
<p>LE BEAU He cannot speak, my lord.</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK Bear him away.— What is thy name, young man?</p>
<p>Charles is carried out/To Orlando</p>
<p>ORLANDO Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
Bois.</p>
<p>DUKE FREDERICK I would thou hadst been son to some man else:</p>
<p>The world esteemed thy father honourable,</p>
<p>But I did find him still 179 mine enemy.</p>
<p>Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed</p>
<p>Hadst thou descended from another house.</p>
<p>But fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth.</p>
<p>I would thou hadst told me of another father.</p>
<p>Exit Duke [with others; Celia, Orlando and Rosalind remain ]</p>
<p>CELIA Were I my father, coz, would I do this?</p>
<p>To Rosalind</p>
<p>ORLANDO I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son,</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>His youngest son, and would not change that calling 180</p>
<p>To be adopted heir to Frederick.</p>
<p>ROSALIND My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,</p>
<p>To Celia</p>
<p>And all the world was of my father’s mind:</p>
<p>Had I before known this young man his son,</p>
<p>I should have given him tears unto 181 entreaties,</p>
<p>Ere 182 he should thus have ventured.</p>
<p>CELIA Gentle cousin,</p>
<p>To Rosalind</p>
<p>Let us go thank him and encourage him.</p>
<p>My father’s rough and envious 183 disposition</p>
<p>Sticks 184 me at heart.— Sir, you have well deserved,</p>
<p>To Orlando</p>
<p>If you do keep your promises in love</p>
<p>But justly 185 , as you have exceeded all promise 186 ,</p>
<p>Your mistress 187 shall be happy.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Gentleman,</p>
<p>Gives him a chain from her neck</p>
<p>Wear this for me, one out of suits 188 with fortune,</p>
<p>That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.</p>
<p>Shall we go, coz?</p>
<p>To Celia</p>
<p>CELIA Ay.— Fare you well, fair gentleman.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts 189</p>
<p>Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up</p>
<p>Is but a quintain 190 , a mere lifeless block.</p>
<p>ROSALIND He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes.</p>
<p>I’ll ask him what he would 191 .— Did you call, sir?</p>
<p>To Orlando</p>
<p>Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown</p>
<p>More than your enemies.</p>
<p>CELIA Will you go, coz?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Have with you 192 . Fare you well.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Rosalind and Celia ]</p>
<p>ORLANDO What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue? I cannot
speak to her, yet she urged conference 193 .</p>
<p>Enter Le Beau</p>
<p>O poor Or 194 lando, thou art overthrown!</p>
<p>Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.</p>
<p>LE BEAU Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you</p>
<p>To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved</p>
<p>High commendation, true applause and love,</p>
<p>Yet such is now the duke’s condition 195</p>
<p>That he misconstrues all that you have done.</p>
<p>The duke is humorous 196 : what he is indeed 197</p>
<p>More suits you to conceive 198 than I to speak of.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:</p>
<p>Which of the two was daughter of the duke</p>
<p>That here was at the wrestling?</p>
<p>LE BEAU Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners,</p>
<p>But yet indeed the taller 199 is his daughter,</p>
<p>The other is daughter to the banished duke,</p>
<p>And here detained by her usurping uncle</p>
<p>To keep his daughter company, whose loves</p>
<p>Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.</p>
<p>But I can tell you that of late this duke</p>
<p>Hath ta’en displeasure ’gainst his gentle 200 niece,</p>
<p>Grounded upon no other argument 201</p>
<p>But that the people praise her for her virtues</p>
<p>And pity her for her good father’s sake;</p>
<p>And, on my life, his malice ’gainst the lady</p>
<p>Will suddenly 202 break forth. Sir, fare you well.</p>
<p>Hereafter, in a better world than this,</p>
<p>I shall desire more love and knowledge 203 of you.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I rest 204 much bounden 205 to you. Fare you well.</p>
<p>[Exit Le Beau ]</p>
<p>Thus must I from the smoke into the smother 206 ,</p>
<p>From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother.</p>
<p>But heavenly Rosalind!</p>
<p>Exit</p>
