<h4 id="scene-3-running-scene-8">Scene 3 ／ running scene 8</h4>
<p>Enter Dogberry 620 and his compartner [Verges 621 ] with the Watch
622</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Are you good men and true 623 ?</p>
<p>VERGES Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation 624
, body and soul.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they
should have any allegiance 625 in them, being chosen for the prince’s
watch.</p>
<p>VERGES Well, give them their charge 626 , neighbour Dogberry.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY First, who think you the most desertless 627 man to be
constable?</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN Hugh Otecake 628 , sir, or George Seacole 629 , for
they can write and read.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed you with a
good name: to be a well-favoured 630 man is the gift of fortune, but to
write and read comes by nature.</p>
<p>Second Watchman steps forward</p>
<p>SECOND WATCHMAN Both which, master constable—</p>
<p>DOGBERRY You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your
favour 631 , sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it. And for
your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such
vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless 632 and fit 633
man for the constable of the watch: therefore bear you the lantern. This
is your charge: you shall comprehend 634 all vagrom 635 men, you are to
bid any man stand 636 , in the prince’s name.</p>
<p>SECOND WATCHMAN How if a will not stand?</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Why, then, take no note of him 637 , but let him go, and
presently call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid
of a knave.</p>
<p>VERGES If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the
prince’s subjects.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY True, and they are to meddle 638 with none but the prince’s
subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets, for for the watch
to babble and talk is most tolerable 639 and not to be endured.</p>
<p>WATCHMAN We will rather sleep than talk: we know what belongs to 640
a watch.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Why, you speak like an ancient 641 and most quiet watchman,
for I cannot see how sleeping should offend: only have a care that your
bills 642 be not stolen. Well, you are to call at all the ale-houses,
and bid them that are drunk get them to bed.</p>
<p>WATCHMAN How if they will not?</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Why then, let them alone till they are sober: if they make
you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you
took them for.</p>
<p>WATCHMAN Well, sir.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your
office, to be no true 643 man: and for such kind of men, the less you
meddle or make with them, why the more is for your honesty.</p>
<p>WATCHMAN If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on
him?</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Truly, by 644 your office, you may, but I think they that
touch pitch 645 will be defiled 646 . The most peaceable way for you, if
you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is, and steal
out of your company.</p>
<p>VERGES You have been always called a merciful man, partner.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will 647 , much more 648
a man who hath any honesty in him.</p>
<p>VERGES If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the
nurse and bid her still 649 it.</p>
<p>WATCHMAN How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Why then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with
crying, for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baas will never
answer a calf when he bleats.</p>
<p>VERGES ’Tis very true.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY This is the end of the charge: you, constable, are to
present 650 the prince’s own person. If you meet the prince in the
night, you may stay 651 him.</p>
<p>VERGES Nay, by’r lady 652 , that I think a cannot.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Five shillings to one on’t, with any man that knows the
statues 653 , he may stay him: marry 654 , not without the prince be
willing, for indeed the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an
offence to stay a man against his will.</p>
<p>VERGES By’r lady, I think it be so.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Ha, ah, ha! Well, masters, good night, an there be any
matter of weight chances 655 , call up me. Keep your fellows’ counsels
656 and your own, and good night. Come, neighbour.</p>
<p>Starts to go</p>
<p>WATCHMAN Well, masters, we hear our charge. Let us go sit here upon
the church- bench till two, and then all to bed.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch about
Signior Leonato’s door, for the wedding being there tomorrow, there is a
great coil 657 tonight. Adieu. Be vigitant 658 , I beseech you.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Dogberry and Verges ]</p>
<p>Enter Borachio and Conrad</p>
<p>BORACHIO What, Conrad?</p>
<p>WATCHMAN Peace! Stir not.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>BORACHIO Conrad, I say!</p>
<p>CONRAD Here, man, I am at thy elbow.</p>
<p>BORACHIO Mass 659 , and my elbow itched, I thought there would a scab
660 follow.</p>
<p>CONRAD I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward with thy
tale.</p>
<p>BORACHIO Stand thee close 661 then under this penthouse 662 , for it
drizzles rain, and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee.</p>
<p>WATCHMAN Some treason, masters. Yet stand close.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>BORACHIO Therefore know, I have earned of Don John a thousand
ducats.</p>
<p>CONRAD Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear 663 ?</p>
<p>BORACHIO Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy
should be so rich, for when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor
ones may make what price they will.</p>
<p>CONRAD I wonder at it.</p>
<p>BORACHIO That shows thou art unconfirmed 664 . Thou knowest that the
fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man 665
.</p>
<p>CONRAD Yes, it is apparel.</p>
<p>BORACHIO I mean the fashion 666 .</p>
<p>CONRAD Yes, the fashion is the fashion.</p>
<p>BORACHIO Tush, I may as well say the fool’s the fool. But seest thou
not what a deformed 667 thief this fashion is?</p>
<p>WATCHMAN I know that Deformed: a has been a vile thief this seven
years, a goes up and down 668 like a gentleman. I remember his name.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>BORACHIO Didst thou not hear somebody?</p>
<p>CONRAD No, ’twas the vane on the house.</p>
<p>BORACHIO Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion
is, how giddily a turns about all the hot bloods 669 between fourteen
and five-and-thirty, sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh’s soldiers
670 in the reechy 671 painting, sometime like god Bel’s priests 672 in
the old church-window, sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched
673 worm-eaten tapestry, where his codpiece 674 seems as massy 675 as
his club?</p>
<p>CONRAD All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears out more
apparel than the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion
too, that thou hast shifted 676 out of thy tale into telling me of the
fashion?</p>
<p>BORACHIO Not so, neither. But know that I have tonight wooed
Margaret, the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman 677 , by the name of Hero. She
leans me out 678 at her mistress’ chamber-window, bids me a thousand
times good night — I tell this tale vilely — I should first tell thee
how the prince, Claudio and my master, planted and placed and possessed
679 by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable 680
encounter.</p>
<p>CONRAD And thought they Margaret was Hero?</p>
<p>BORACHIO Two of them did, the prince and Claudio, but the devil my
master knew she was Margaret, and partly by his oaths 681 , which first
possessed them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive them, but
chiefly by my villainy, which did confirm any slander that Don John had
made. Away went Claudio enraged, swore he would meet her as he was
appointed next morning at the temple, and there, before the whole
congregation, shame her with what he saw o’er-night, and send her home
again without a husband.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN We charge you in the prince’s name, stand!</p>
<p>SECOND WATCHMAN Call up the right master constable. We have here
recovered 682 the most dangerous piece of lechery 683 that ever was
known in the commonwealth.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN And one Deformed is one of them. I know him, a wears a
lock 684 .</p>
<p>CONRAD Masters, masters—</p>
<p>SECOND WATCHMAN You’ll be made 685 bring Deformed forth, I warrant
you.</p>
<p>CONRAD Masters—</p>
<p>FIRST WATCHMAN Never speak, we charge you. Let us obey 686 you to go
with us.</p>
<p>BORACHIO We are like to prove a goodly commodity 687 , being taken up
688 of these men’s bills 689 .</p>
<p>CONRAD A commodity in question 690 , I warrant you. Come, we’ll obey
you.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
