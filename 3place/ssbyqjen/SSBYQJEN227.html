<h4 id="scene-3-902-running-scene-5">Scene 3 902 / running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter Grumio</p>
<p>GRUMIO Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul
ways 903 ! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so rayed 904 ? Was ever
man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they are coming after
to warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon hot 905 , my very
lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my
heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me. But I with
blowing the fire shall warm myself, for, considering the weather, a
taller 906 man than I will take cold. Holla, ho, Curtis!</p>
<p>Enter Curtis</p>
<p>CURTIS Who is that calls so coldly 907 ?</p>
<p>GRUMIO A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my
shoulder to my heel with no greater a run 908 but my head and my neck. A
fire good Curtis.</p>
<p>CURTIS Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?</p>
<p>GRUMIO O, ay, Curtis, ay, and therefore fire, fire, cast on no water
909 .</p>
<p>CURTIS Is she so hot 910 a shrew as she’s reported?</p>
<p>GRUMIO She was, good Curtis, before this frost. But, thou know’st,
winter tames man, woman and beast 911 , for it hath tamed my old master
and my new mistress and myself, fellow Curtis.</p>
<p>CURTIS Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast 912 .</p>
<p>GRUMIO Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn 913 is a foot, and so
long am I at the least 914 . But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I
complain on thee to our mistress, whose hand, she being now at hand,
thou shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot
office 915 ?</p>
<p>CURTIS I prithee, good Grumio, tell me how goes the world?</p>
<p>GRUMIO A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine, and therefore
fire: do thy duty 916 , and have thy duty, for my master and mistress
are almost frozen to death.</p>
<p>CURTIS There’s fire ready, and therefore, good Grumio, the news.</p>
<p>GRUMIO Why, ‘Jack, boy! Ho, boy!’ and as much news 917 as wilt
thou.</p>
<p>CURTIS Come, you are so full of cony-catching 918 !</p>
<p>GRUMIO Why, therefore fire, for I have caught extreme cold. Where’s
the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimmed 919 , rushes strewed 920 ,
cobwebs swept, the servingmen in their new fustian 921 , the white
stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on? Be the jacks 922
fair within, the jills 923 fair without, the carpets laid 924 , and
everything in order?</p>
<p>CURTIS All ready, and therefore, I pray thee, news.</p>
<p>GRUMIO First know my horse is tired, my master and mistress fallen
out.</p>
<p>CURTIS How?</p>
<p>GRUMIO Out of their saddles into the dirt, and thereby hangs a
tale.</p>
<p>CURTIS Let’s ha’t 925 , good Grumio.</p>
<p>GRUMIO Lend thine ear.</p>
<p>CURTIS Here.</p>
<p>GRUMIO There.</p>
<p>Strikes him</p>
<p>CURTIS This ’tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.</p>
<p>GRUMIO And therefore ’tis called a sensible 926 tale, and this cuff
was but to knock at your ear, and beseech listening. Now I begin:
Imprimis 927 , we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my
mistress—</p>
<p>CURTIS Both of 928 one horse?</p>
<p>GRUMIO What’s that to thee?</p>
<p>CURTIS Why, a horse.</p>
<p>GRUMIO Tell thou the tale. But hadst thou not crossed 929 me, thou
shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her horse: thou
shouldst have heard in how miry 930 a place, how she was bemoiled 931 ,
how he left her with the horse upon her, how he beat me because her
horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me, how
he swore, how she prayed that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
horses ran away, how her bridle was burst 932 , how I lost my crupper,
with many things of worthy memory 933 , which now shall die in oblivion
and thou return unexperienced 934 to thy grave.</p>
<p>CURTIS By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.</p>
<p>GRUMIO Ay, and that thou and the proudest 935 of you all shall find
when he comes home. But what 936 talk I of this? Call forth Nathaniel,
Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop and the rest. Let their heads
be slickly combed, their blue 937 coats brushed and their garters of an
indifferent knit 938 . Let them curtsy 939 with their left legs 940 and
not presume to touch a hair of my master’s horsetail till they kiss
their hands 941 . Are they all ready?</p>
<p>CURTIS They are.</p>
<p>GRUMIO Call them forth.</p>
<p>CURTIS Do you hear, ho? You must meet my master to countenance 942 my
mistress.</p>
<p>GRUMIO Why, she hath a face of her own.</p>
<p>CURTIS Who knows not that?</p>
<p>GRUMIO Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.</p>
<p>CURTIS I call them forth to credit 943 her.</p>
<p>Enter four or five Servingmen</p>
<p>GRUMIO Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.</p>
<p>NATHANIEL Welcome home, Grumio!</p>
<p>PHILIP How now, Grumio!</p>
<p>JOSEPH What, Grumio!</p>
<p>NICHOLAS Fellow Grumio!</p>
<p>NATHANIEL How now, old lad?</p>
<p>GRUMIO Welcome, you.— How now, you?— What, you?— Fellow, you.— And
thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce 944 companions, is all ready, and
all things neat 945 ?</p>
<p>Greets each</p>
<p>Servingman</p>
<p>NATHANIEL All things is ready. How near is our master?</p>
<p>GRUMIO E’en at hand, alighted by this 946 , and therefore be not—
Cock’s passion 947 , silence! I hear my master.</p>
<p>Enter Petruchio and Kate</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Where be these knaves? What, no man at door</p>
<p>To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse?</p>
<p>Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?</p>
<p>ALL SERVINGMEN Here, here, sir, here, sir.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Here, sir, here, sir, here, sir, here, sir!</p>
<p>You logger-headed 948 and unpolished grooms!</p>
<p>What, no attendance? No regard? No duty?</p>
<p>Where is the foolish knave I sent before?</p>
<p>GRUMIO Here, sir, as foolish as I was before.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO You peasant swain 949 . You whoreson 950 malt-horse drudge
951 .</p>
<p>Did I not bid thee meet me in the park 952 ,</p>
<p>And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?</p>
<p>GRUMIO Nathaniel’s coat, sir, was not fully made 953 ,</p>
<p>And Gabriel’s pumps were all unpinked 954 i’th’heel.</p>
<p>There was no link 955 to colour Peter’s hat,</p>
<p>And Walter’s dagger was not come from sheathing 956 .</p>
<p>There were none fine 957 but Adam, Rafe and Gregory,</p>
<p>The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly.</p>
<p>Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.</p>
<p>Exeunt Servingmen</p>
<p>’Where is the life that late I led?</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Where are those—’ 958</p>
<p>Sit down, Kate, and welcome.— Soud 959 , soud, soud, soud!</p>
<p>They sit</p>
<p>Enter Servants with supper</p>
<p>Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.—</p>
<p>Off with my boots, you rogues! You villains, when 960 ?</p>
<p>A Servant takes off his boot</p>
<p>’It was the friar of orders grey 961 ,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>As he forth walkèd on his way 962 —’</p>
<p>Out 963 , you rogue! You pluck my foot awry 964 .</p>
<p>Take that, and mend 965 the plucking of the other.</p>
<p>Kicks him</p>
<p>Be merry, Kate.— Some water 966 , here. What, ho!</p>
<p>Enter one with water</p>
<p>Where’s my spaniel Troilus 967 ? Sirrah, get you hence,</p>
<p>And bid my cousin Ferdinand 968 come hither.—</p>
<p>One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.—</p>
<p>Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?</p>
<p>Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.—</p>
<p>Servant spills water</p>
<p>You whoreson villain, will you let it fall?</p>
<p>Strikes the Servant</p>
<p>KATE Patience, I pray you. ’Twas a fault unwilling.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO A whoreson beetle-headed 969 , flap-eared 970 knave!—</p>
<p>Come, Kate, sit down, I know you have a stomach 971 .</p>
<p>Will you give thanks 972 , sweet Kate, or else shall I?</p>
<p>What’s this? Mutton?</p>
<p>FIRST SERVANT Ay.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Who brought it?</p>
<p>PETER I.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO ’Tis burnt, and so is all the meat.</p>
<p>What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook?</p>
<p>How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser 973</p>
<p>And serve it thus to me that love it not?</p>
<p>There, take it to you, trenchers 974 , cups, and all.</p>
<p>Throws the meat and dishes at them</p>
<p>You heedless joltheads 975 and unmannered 976 slaves!</p>
<p>What, do you grumble? I’ll be with you straight 977 .</p>
<p>KATE I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet.</p>
<p>The meat was well 978 , if you were so contented.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO I tell thee, Kate, ’twas burnt and dried away,</p>
<p>And I expressly am forbid to touch it,</p>
<p>For it engenders choler 979 , planteth anger,</p>
<p>And better ’twere that both of us did fast,</p>
<p>Since, of ourselves 980 , ourselves are choleric,</p>
<p>Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.</p>
<p>Be patient, tomorrow’t shall be mended,</p>
<p>And for this night we’ll fast for company 981 .</p>
<p>Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Enter Servants severally</p>
<p>NATHANIEL Peter, didst ever see the like?</p>
<p>PETER He kills her in her own humour 982 .</p>
<p>GRUMIO Where is he?</p>
<p>Enter Curtis, a servant</p>
<p>CURTIS In her chamber, making a sermon of continency 983 to her,</p>
<p>And rails and swears and rates 984 that she, poor soul,</p>
<p>Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,</p>
<p>And sits as one new-risen 985 from a dream.</p>
<p>Away, away, for he is coming hither.</p>
<p>[Exeunt ]</p>
<p>Enter Petruchio</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Thus have I politicly 986 begun my reign,</p>
<p>And ’tis my hope to end successfully.</p>
<p>My falcon 987 now is sharp 988 and passing empty,</p>
<p>And till she stoop 989 she must not be full-gorged 990 ,</p>
<p>For then she never looks upon 991 her lure 992 .</p>
<p>Another way I have to man 993 my haggard 994 ,</p>
<p>To make her come and know her keeper’s call,</p>
<p>That is, to watch her 995 , as we watch these kites 996</p>
<p>That bate and beat 997 and will not be obedient.</p>
<p>She eat 998 no meat today, nor none shall eat.</p>
<p>Last night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not.</p>
<p>As with the meat, some undeservèd fault</p>
<p>I’ll find about the making of the bed,</p>
<p>And here I’ll fling the pillow, there the bolster,</p>
<p>This way the coverlet, another way the sheets.</p>
<p>Ay, and amid this hurly 999 I intend 1000</p>
<p>That all is done in reverend care of her.</p>
<p>And in conclusion she shall watch 1001 all night,</p>
<p>And if she chance to nod I’ll rail and brawl</p>
<p>And with the clamour keep her still awake.</p>
<p>This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,</p>
<p>And thus I’ll curb her mad and headstrong humour.</p>
<p>He that knows better how to tame a shrew,</p>
<p>Now let him speak. ’Tis charity to show 1002 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
