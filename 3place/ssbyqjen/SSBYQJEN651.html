<h4 id="scene-3-running-scene-5">Scene 3 / running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter King Philip, Lewis, Cardinal Pandulph [and ] Attendants</p>
<p>KING PHILIP So by a roaring tempest on the flood 943 ,</p>
<p>A whole armado 944 of convicted 945 sail</p>
<p>Is scattered and disjoined from fellowship 946 .</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH Courage and comfort: all shall yet go well.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP What can go well when we have run 947 so ill?</p>
<p>Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?</p>
<p>Arthur ta’en prisoner? Divers 948 dear friends slain?</p>
<p>And bloody 949 England 950 into England gone,</p>
<p>O’erbearing 951 interruption 952 , spite 953 of France?</p>
<p>LEWIS What he hath won, that hath he fortified:</p>
<p>So hot 954 a speed with such advice 955 disposed 956 ,</p>
<p>Such temperate 957 order in so fierce a cause,</p>
<p>Doth want example 958 : who hath read or heard</p>
<p>Of any kindred 959 action like 960 to this?</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Well could I bear that England had this praise,</p>
<p>So 961 we could find some pattern 962 of our shame.</p>
<p>Enter Constance</p>
<p>Distracted, with her hair down</p>
<p>Look, who comes here! A grave 963 unto a soul:</p>
<p>Holding th’eternal spirit against her will,</p>
<p>In the vile prison of afflicted breath:</p>
<p>I prithee, lady, go away with me.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE Lo, now: now see the issue 964 of your peace 965 .</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Patience, good lady: comfort, gentle Constance.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE No, I defy 966 all counsel 967 , all redress 968 ,</p>
<p>But 969 that which ends all counsel, true redress:</p>
<p>Death, death, O amiable 970 , lovely death:</p>
<p>Thou odoriferous 971 stench: sound 972 rottenness:</p>
<p>Arise forth from the couch of lasting 973 night,</p>
<p>Thou hate and terror to prosperity,</p>
<p>And I will kiss thy detestable bones,</p>
<p>And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty 974 brows,</p>
<p>And ring these fingers with thy household worms,</p>
<p>And stop this gap of breath 975 with fulsome 976 dust,</p>
<p>And be a carrion 977 monster like thyself:</p>
<p>Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smil’st</p>
<p>And buss 978 thee as thy wife: misery’s love,</p>
<p>O, come to me!</p>
<p>KING PHILIP O fair affliction 979 , peace!</p>
<p>CONSTANCE No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:</p>
<p>O, that my tongue were in the thunder’s mouth!</p>
<p>Then with a passion would I shake the world,</p>
<p>And rouse from sleep that fell 980 anatomy 981</p>
<p>Which cannot hear a lady’s feeble voice,</p>
<p>Which scorns a modern 982 invocation 983 .</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE Thou art not holy to belie 984 me so:</p>
<p>I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine:</p>
<p>My name is Constance: I was Geoffrey’s wife:</p>
<p>Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:</p>
<p>I am not mad: I would to heaven I were,</p>
<p>For then, ’tis like 985 I should forget myself:</p>
<p>O, if I could, what grief should I forget!</p>
<p>Preach some philosophy to make me mad,</p>
<p>And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal:</p>
<p>For, being not mad, but sensible of 986 grief,</p>
<p>My reasonable part 987 produces reason</p>
<p>How I may be delivered of 988 these woes,</p>
<p>And teaches me to kill or hang myself:</p>
<p>If I were mad, I should forget my son,</p>
<p>Or madly think a babe of clouts 989 990 were he:</p>
<p>I am not mad: too well, too well I feel</p>
<p>The different 991 plague 992 of each calamity.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Bind up those tresses 993 : O, what love I note</p>
<p>In the fair multitude of those her hairs!</p>
<p>Where but by chance a silver drop 994 hath fallen,</p>
<p>Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends 995</p>
<p>Do glue themselves in sociable 996 grief,</p>
<p>Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,</p>
<p>Sticking together in calamity.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE To England, if you will 997 .</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Bind up your hairs.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE Yes, that I will: and wherefore 998 will I do it?</p>
<p>I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud</p>
<p>’O, that these hands could so redeem 999 my son,</p>
<p>As they have given these hairs their liberty!’</p>
<p>But now I envy at 1000 their liberty,</p>
<p>And will again commit them to their bonds,</p>
<p>Because my poor child is a prisoner.</p>
<p>She binds up her hair</p>
<p>And, Father Cardinal, I have heard you say</p>
<p>That we shall see and know 1001 our friends in heaven:</p>
<p>If that be true, I shall see my boy again;</p>
<p>For since the birth of Cain 1002 , the first male child,</p>
<p>To him that did but yesterday suspire 1003 ,</p>
<p>There was not such a gracious 1004 creature born:</p>
<p>But now will canker-sorrow 1005 eat my bud 1006</p>
<p>And chase the native 1007 beauty from his cheek,</p>
<p>And he will look as hollow as a ghost,</p>
<p>As dim 1008 and meagre 1009 as an ague’s fit 1010 ,</p>
<p>And so 1011 he’ll die: and rising 1012 so again,</p>
<p>When I shall meet him in the court of heaven</p>
<p>I shall not know 1013 him: therefore never, never</p>
<p>Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH You hold too heinous 1014 a respect 1015 of
grief.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE He talks to me that never had a son.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP You are as fond of 1016 grief as of your child.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE Grief fills the room 1017 up of my absent child:</p>
<p>Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,</p>
<p>Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,</p>
<p>Remembers 1018 me of all his gracious parts,</p>
<p>Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form 1019 ;</p>
<p>Then have I reason to be fond of grief?</p>
<p>Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,</p>
<p>I could give better comfort than you do.</p>
<p>She unbinds her hair</p>
<p>I will not keep this form upon my head,</p>
<p>When there is such disorder in my wit:</p>
<p>O lord, my boy, my Arthur, my fair son,</p>
<p>My life, my joy, my food, my all the world:</p>
<p>My widow-comfort, and my sorrows’ cure!</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KING PHILIP I fear some outrage 1020 , and I’ll follow her.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>LEWIS There’s nothing in this world can make me joy 1021 :</p>
<p>Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale,</p>
<p>Vexing the dull 1022 ear of a drowsy man;</p>
<p>And bitter shame hath spoiled the sweet word’s 1023 taste</p>
<p>That 1024 it yields nought but shame and bitterness.</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH Before the curing of a strong disease,</p>
<p>Even in the instant 1025 of repair 1026 and health,</p>
<p>The fit 1027 is strongest: evils that take leave,</p>
<p>On their departure most of all show evil:</p>
<p>What have you lost by losing of this day 1028 ?</p>
<p>LEWIS All days of glory, joy and happiness.</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH If you had 1029 won it, certainly you had.</p>
<p>No, no: when Fortune means 1030 to men most good,</p>
<p>She looks upon them with a threat’ning eye:</p>
<p>’Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost</p>
<p>In this which he accounts 1031 so clearly won:</p>
<p>Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?</p>
<p>LEWIS As heartily as he is glad he hath him.</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.</p>
<p>Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit:</p>
<p>For even the breath of what I mean to speak</p>
<p>Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub 1032 ,</p>
<p>Out of the path which shall directly lead</p>
<p>Thy foot to England’s throne. And therefore mark 1033 :</p>
<p>John hath seized Arthur, and it cannot be</p>
<p>That whiles warm life plays in that infant 1034 ’s veins,</p>
<p>The misplaced 1035 John should entertain 1036 an hour,</p>
<p>One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.</p>
<p>A sceptre snatched with an unruly hand</p>
<p>Must be as boisterously 1037 maintained as gained:</p>
<p>And he that stands upon a slipp’ry place</p>
<p>Makes nice of no 1038 vile hold to stay 1039 him up:</p>
<p>That 1040 John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall:</p>
<p>So be it, for it cannot be but so.</p>
<p>LEWIS But what shall I gain by young Arthur’s fall?</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH You, in the right of Lady Blanche your wife,</p>
<p>May then make all the claim that Arthur did.</p>
<p>LEWIS And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH How green 1041 you are, and fresh in this old
world!</p>
<p>John lays you plots 1042 : the times conspire with you:</p>
<p>For he that steeps 1043 his safety in true 1044 blood</p>
<p>Shall find but bloody safety and untrue 1045 .</p>
<p>This act, so evilly born, shall cool the hearts</p>
<p>Of all his people and freeze up their zeal 1046 ,</p>
<p>That none so small advantage 1047 shall step forth</p>
<p>To check 1048 his reign 1049 , but they will cherish it:</p>
<p>No natural exhalation 1050 in the sky,</p>
<p>No scope 1051 of nature, no distempered 1052 day,</p>
<p>No common wind, no customèd 1053 event,</p>
<p>But they will pluck away 1054 his 1055 natural cause 1056</p>
<p>And call them meteors, prodigies 1057 , and signs,</p>
<p>Abortives 1058 , presages 1059 , and tongues of heaven,</p>
<p>Plainly denouncing 1060 vengeance upon John.</p>
<p>LEWIS Maybe he will not touch young Arthur’s life,</p>
<p>But hold 1061 himself 1062 safe in his prisonment 1063 .</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH O sir, when he shall hear of your approach 1064
,</p>
<p>If that young Arthur be not gone already,</p>
<p>Even at that news he dies: and then the hearts</p>
<p>Of all his people shall revolt from him,</p>
<p>And kiss the lips of 1065 unacquainted 1066 change,</p>
<p>And pick 1067 strong matter of 1068 revolt and wrath</p>
<p>Out of the bloody fingers’ ends of John 1069 .</p>
<p>Methinks I see this hurly 1070 all on foot 1071 :</p>
<p>And O, what better matter breeds 1072 for you</p>
<p>Than I have named! The Bastard Falconbridge</p>
<p>Is now in England, ransacking the Church,</p>
<p>Offending charity: if but a dozen French</p>
<p>Were there in arms, they would be as a call 1073</p>
<p>To train 1074 ten thousand English to their side,</p>
<p>Or, as a little snow, tumbled about,</p>
<p>Anon 1075 becomes a mountain. O noble dauphin,</p>
<p>Go with me to the king: ’tis wonderful</p>
<p>What may be wrought 1076 out of their discontent,</p>
<p>Now that their souls are top-full 1077 of offence 1078 .</p>
<p>For England go: I will whet on 1079 the king.</p>
<p>LEWIS Strong reasons make strange actions 1080 : let us go:</p>
<p>If you say ay 1081 , the king will not say no.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
