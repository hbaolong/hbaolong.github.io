continues</h4>
<p>Enter the King [Henry V ], Humphrey [Duke of Gloucester ], Bedford,
Clarence, Warwick, Westmorland, Exeter [and Attendants ]</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Where is my gracious 108 lord of Canterbury?</p>
<p>EXETER Not here in presence 109 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Send for him, good uncle.</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Shall we call in th’ambassador, my liege?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Not yet, my cousin 110 : we would be resolved 111 ,</p>
<p>Before we hear him, of some things of weight</p>
<p>That task 112 our thoughts, concerning us and France.</p>
<p>Enter [the ] two Bishops</p>
<p>CANTERBURY God and his angels guard your sacred throne</p>
<p>And make you long become 113 it!</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Sure, we thank you.</p>
<p>My learnèd lord, we pray you to proceed</p>
<p>And justly 114 and religiously unfold 115</p>
<p>Why the law Salic 116 that they have in France</p>
<p>Or 117 should, or should not, bar 118 us in our claim.</p>
<p>And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,</p>
<p>That you should fashion, wrest, or bow 119 your reading 120 ,</p>
<p>Or nicely charge 121 your understanding soul</p>
<p>With opening titles miscreate 122 , whose right</p>
<p>Suits not in native colours 123 with the truth,</p>
<p>For God doth know how many now in health</p>
<p>Shall drop their blood 124 in approbation 125</p>
<p>Of what your reverence shall incite us to.</p>
<p>Therefore take heed how you impawn our person 126 ,</p>
<p>How you awake our sleeping sword of war;</p>
<p>We charge 127 you, in the name of God, take heed,</p>
<p>For never two such kingdoms did contend</p>
<p>Without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops</p>
<p>Are every one a woe, a sore complaint 128</p>
<p>Gainst him whose wrongs 129 gives edge unto the swords</p>
<p>That make such waste in brief mortality.</p>
<p>Under this conjuration 130 , speak, my lord,</p>
<p>For we will hear, note 131 and believe in heart</p>
<p>That what you speak is in your conscience washed</p>
<p>As pure as sin with baptism.</p>
<p>CANTERBURY Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</p>
<p>That owe yourselves, your lives and services</p>
<p>To this imperial throne. There is no bar</p>
<p>To make against your highness’ claim to France</p>
<p>But this, which they produce from Pharamond 132 ,</p>
<p>‘In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant’,</p>
<p>‘No woman shall succeed in Salic land.’</p>
<p>Which Salic land the French unjustly gloss 133</p>
<p>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</p>
<p>The founder of this law and female bar.</p>
<p>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</p>
<p>That the land Salic is in Germany,</p>
<p>Between the floods 134 of Sala and of Elbe 135 ,</p>
<p>Where Charles the Great 136 , having subdued the Saxons,</p>
<p>There left behind and settled certain French,</p>
<p>Who, holding in disdain the German women</p>
<p>For some dishonest manners 137 of their life,</p>
<p>Established then this law; to wit 138 , no female</p>
<p>Should be inheritrix 139 in Salic land ——</p>
<p>Which Salic, as I said, ’twixt 140 Elbe and Sala,</p>
<p>Is at this day in Germany called Meisen.</p>
<p>Then doth it well appear the Salic law</p>
<p>Was not devisèd for the realm of France,</p>
<p>Nor did the French possess the Salic land</p>
<p>Until four hundred one-and-twenty years</p>
<p>After defunction 141 of King Pharamond ——</p>
<p>Idly 142 supposed the founder of this law ——</p>
<p>Who died within the year of our redemption 143</p>
<p>Four hundred twenty-six, and Charles the Great</p>
<p>Subdued the Saxons, and did seat 144 the French</p>
<p>Beyond the river Sala, in the year</p>
<p>Eight hundred five. Besides 145 , their writers say,</p>
<p>King Pepin, which deposèd Childeric,</p>
<p>Did, as heir general 146 , being descended</p>
<p>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</p>
<p>Make claim and title to the crown of France.</p>
<p>Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown</p>
<p>Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</p>
<p>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great 147 ,</p>
<p>To find 148 his title with some shows of truth,</p>
<p>Though, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</p>
<p>Conveyed himself 149 as th’heir to th’Lady Lingare,</p>
<p>Daughter to Charlemagne 150 , who was the son</p>
<p>To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son</p>
<p>Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth 151 ,</p>
<p>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</p>
<p>Could not keep quiet 152 in his conscience,</p>
<p>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</p>
<p>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</p>
<p>Was lineal 153 of the Lady Ermengare,</p>
<p>Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine:</p>
<p>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</p>
<p>Was reunited to the crown of France.</p>
<p>So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun,</p>
<p>King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim,</p>
<p>King Lewis his satisfaction 154 , all appear</p>
<p>To hold in 155 right and title of the female:</p>
<p>So do the kings of France unto this day,</p>
<p>Howbeit 156 they would 157 hold up this Salic law</p>
<p>To bar your highness claiming from the female,</p>
<p>And rather choose to hide them in a net 158</p>
<p>Than amply 159 to imbar 160 their crooked 161 titles</p>
<p>Usurped from you and your progenitors 162 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V May I with right and conscience make this claim?</p>
<p>CANTERBURY The sin upon my head 163 , dread 164 sovereign!</p>
<p>For in the book of Numbers is it writ,</p>
<p>When the man dies, let the inheritance</p>
<p>Descend unto the daughter 165 . Gracious lord,</p>
<p>Stand for 166 your own, unwind your bloody flag,</p>
<p>Look back into your mighty ancestors:</p>
<p>Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire 167 ’s tomb,</p>
<p>From whom you claim 168 ; invoke his warlike spirit,</p>
<p>And your great-uncle’s, Edward the Black Prince,</p>
<p>Who on the French ground played a tragedy,</p>
<p>Making defeat on the full power of France 169 ,</p>
<p>Whiles his most mighty father on a hill</p>
<p>Stood smiling to behold his lion’s whelp 170</p>
<p>Forage 171 in blood of French nobility.</p>
<p>O, noble English, that could entertain 172</p>
<p>With half their forces the full pride of France</p>
<p>And let another half stand laughing by,</p>
<p>All out of work and cold for 173 action!</p>
<p>ELY Awake remembrance of these valiant dead 174</p>
<p>And with your puissant 175 arm renew their feats;</p>
<p>You are their heir, you sit upon their throne:</p>
<p>The blood and courage that renownèd 176 them</p>
<p>Runs in your veins, and my thrice-puissant liege</p>
<p>Is in the very May-morn of his youth,</p>
<p>Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.</p>
<p>EXETER Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth</p>
<p>Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,</p>
<p>As did the former lions of your blood 177 .</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND They know your grace hath cause and means and might;</p>
<p>So hath your highness. Never King of England 178</p>
<p>Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,</p>
<p>Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England</p>
<p>And lie pavilioned 179 in the fields of France.</p>
<p>CANTERBURY O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,</p>
<p>With bloods and sword and fire to win your right 180 .</p>
<p>In aid whereof we of the spiritualty 181</p>
<p>Will raise your highness such a mighty sum</p>
<p>As never did the clergy at one time</p>
<p>Bring in to any of your ancestors.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V We must not only arm t’invade the French,</p>
<p>But lay down our proportions 182 to defend</p>
<p>Against the Scot, who will make road 183 upon us</p>
<p>With all advantages 184 .</p>
<p>CANTERBURY They of those marches 185 , gracious sovereign,</p>
<p>Shall be a wall sufficient to defend</p>
<p>Our inland from the pilfering borderers 186 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V We do not mean the coursing snatchers 187 only,</p>
<p>But fear the main intendment 188 of the Scot,</p>
<p>Who hath been still a giddy 189 neighbour to us.</p>
<p>For you shall read that my great-grandfather</p>
<p>Never went with his forces into France</p>
<p>But that the Scot on his unfurnished 190 kingdom</p>
<p>Came pouring like the tide into a breach 191 ,</p>
<p>With ample and brim 192 fullness of his force,</p>
<p>Galling 193 the gleanèd 194 land with hot 195 assays 196 ,</p>
<p>Girding 197 with grievous siege castles and towns,</p>
<p>That England, being empty of defence,</p>
<p>Hath shook and trembled at th’ill neighbourhood 198 .</p>
<p>CANTERBURY She 199 hath been then more feared than harmed, my
liege,</p>
<p>For hear her but exampled by herself 200 :</p>
<p>When all her chivalry 201 hath been in France</p>
<p>And she a mourning widow of her nobles,</p>
<p>She hath herself not only well defended</p>
<p>But taken and impounded as a stray 202</p>
<p>The king of Scots, whom she did send to France 203 ,</p>
<p>To fill King Edward’s fame 204 with prisoner kings</p>
<p>And make their 205 chronicle 206 as rich with praise</p>
<p>As is the ooze 207 and bottom of the sea</p>
<p>With sunken wreck and sumless treasuries.</p>
<p>ELY 208 But there’s a saying very old and true,</p>
<p>’If that you will France win,</p>
<p>Then with Scotland first begin.’</p>
<p>For once the eagle England being in prey 209 ,</p>
<p>To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot</p>
<p>Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,</p>
<p>Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,</p>
<p>To ’tame 210 and havoc 211 more than she can eat.</p>
<p>EXETER It follows then the cat must stay at home,</p>
<p>Yet that is but a crushed 212 necessity,</p>
<p>Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries</p>
<p>And pretty 213 traps to catch the petty thieves.</p>
<p>While that the armèd hand doth fight abroad,</p>
<p>Th’advisèd 214 head defends itself at home,</p>
<p>For government, though high and low and lower 215 ,</p>
<p>Put into parts 216 , doth keep in one consent 217 ,</p>
<p>Congreeing 218 in a full and natural close 219 ,</p>
<p>Like music.</p>
<p>CANTERBURY Therefore doth heaven divide</p>
<p>The state of man in divers 220 functions,</p>
<p>Setting endeavour in continual motion,</p>
<p>To which is fixèd, as an aim 221 or butt 222 ,</p>
<p>Obedience, for so work the honeybees,</p>
<p>Creatures that by a rule in nature teach</p>
<p>The act of order to a peopled kingdom.</p>
<p>They have a king 223 and officers of sorts,</p>
<p>Where some, like magistrates, correct 224 at home,</p>
<p>Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad:</p>
<p>Others, like soldiers, armèd in their stings 225 ,</p>
<p>Make boot upon 226 the summer’s velvet buds,</p>
<p>Which pillage 227 they with merry march bring home</p>
<p>To the tent-royal of their emperor,</p>
<p>Who, busied in his majesty 228 , surveys</p>
<p>The singing masons 229 building roofs of gold,</p>
<p>The civil 230 citizens kneading up the honey,</p>
<p>The poor mechanic 231 porters crowding in</p>
<p>Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,</p>
<p>The sad-eyed justice 232 , with his surly 233 hum 234 ,</p>
<p>Delivering o’er to executors 235 pale</p>
<p>The lazy yawning drone 236 . I this infer,</p>
<p>That many things, having full reference</p>
<p>To one consent 237 , may work contrariously 238 .</p>
<p>As many arrows, loosèd several ways,</p>
<p>Come to one mark 239 , as many ways 240 meet in one town,</p>
<p>As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea,</p>
<p>As many lines close 241 in the dial’s 242 centre,</p>
<p>So may a thousand actions, once afoot</p>
<p>End in one purpose, and be all well borne 243</p>
<p>Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.</p>
<p>Divide your happy 244 England into four,</p>
<p>Whereof take you one quarter into France,</p>
<p>And you withal 245 shall make all Gallia 246 shake.</p>
<p>If we with thrice such powers left at home</p>
<p>Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,</p>
<p>Let us be worried 247 and our nation lose</p>
<p>The name of hardiness and policy 248 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Call in the messengers sent from the dauphin 249 .</p>
<p>[Exeunt some ]</p>
<p>Now are we well resolved 250 , and, by God’s help</p>
<p>And yours, the noble sinews of our power,</p>
<p>France being ours, we’ll bend it to our awe 251 ,</p>
<p>Or 252 break it all to pieces. Or there we’ll sit,</p>
<p>Ruling in large 253 and ample empery 254</p>
<p>O’er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,</p>
<p>Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,</p>
<p>Tombless, with no remembrance over them:</p>
<p>Either our history shall with full mouth 255</p>
<p>Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,</p>
<p>Like Turkish mute 256 , shall have a tongueless mouth,</p>
<p>Not worshipped with a waxen 257 epitaph.</p>
<p>Enter Ambassadors of France</p>
<p>Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure 258</p>
<p>Of our fair cousin dauphin, for we hear</p>
<p>Your greeting is from him, not from the king.</p>
<p>FIRST AMBASSADOR May’t please your majesty to give us leave</p>
<p>Freely to render 259 what we have in charge 260 ,</p>
<p>Or shall we sparingly 261 show you far off 262</p>
<p>The dauphin’s meaning and our embassy?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V We are no tyrant, but a Christian king,</p>
<p>Unto whose grace our passion is as subject 263</p>
<p>As are our wretches fettered 264 in our prisons:</p>
<p>Therefore with frank and with uncurbèd plainness</p>
<p>Tell us the dauphin’s mind.</p>
<p>FIRST AMBASSADOR Thus, then, in few 265 :</p>
<p>Your highness, lately sending into 266 France,</p>
<p>Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right</p>
<p>Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.</p>
<p>In answer of which claim, the prince our master</p>
<p>Says that you savour 267 too much of your youth,</p>
<p>And bids you be advised 268 there’s naught in France</p>
<p>That can be with a nimble galliard 269 won.</p>
<p>You cannot revel into dukedoms there:</p>
<p>He therefore sends you, meeter 270 for your spirit,</p>
<p>This tun 271 of treasure; and in lieu of this,</p>
<p>Presents a box</p>
<p>Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim</p>
<p>Hear no more of you. This the dauphin speaks.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V What treasure, uncle?</p>
<p>EXETER Tennis balls, my liege.</p>
<p>Looks in the box</p>
<p>KING HENRY V We are glad the dauphin is so pleasant 272 with us.</p>
<p>His present and your pains we thank you for:</p>
<p>When we have matched our rackets 273 to these balls,</p>
<p>We will in France, by God’s grace, play a set</p>
<p>Shall strike his father’s crown 274 into the hazard 275 .</p>
<p>Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler 276</p>
<p>That all the courts 277 of France will be disturbed</p>
<p>With chaces 278 . And we understand him well,</p>
<p>How he comes o’er us 279 with our wilder days,</p>
<p>Not measuring 280 what use we made of them.</p>
<p>We never valued this poor seat 281 of England,</p>
<p>And therefore, living hence 282 , did give ourself</p>
<p>To barbarous licence 283 , as ’tis ever common</p>
<p>That men are merriest when they are from home.</p>
<p>But tell the dauphin I will keep my state 284 ,</p>
<p>Be like a king and show my sail of greatness 285</p>
<p>When I do rouse me 286 in my throne of France.</p>
<p>For that 287 I have laid by my majesty</p>
<p>And plodded like a man for working days 288 ,</p>
<p>But I will rise there with so full a glory</p>
<p>That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,</p>
<p>Yea, strike the dauphin blind to look on us.</p>
<p>And tell the pleasant prince this mock 289 of his</p>
<p>Hath turned his balls 290 to gun-stones 291 , and his soul</p>
<p>Shall stand sore chargèd 292 for the wasteful 293 vengeance</p>
<p>That shall fly with them, for many a thousand widows</p>
<p>Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;</p>
<p>Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down,</p>
<p>And some are yet ungotten 294 and unborn</p>
<p>That shall have cause to curse the dauphin’s scorn.</p>
<p>But this lies all within the will of God,</p>
<p>To whom I do appeal, and in whose name</p>
<p>Tell you the dauphin I am coming on</p>
<p>To venge me 295 as I may and to put forth</p>
<p>My rightful hand in a well-hallowed 296 cause.</p>
<p>So get you hence in peace, and tell the dauphin</p>
<p>His jest will savour but of shallow wit,</p>
<p>When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.</p>
<p>Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.</p>
<p>Exeunt Ambassadors</p>
<p>EXETER This was a merry message.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V We hope to make the sender blush at it:</p>
<p>Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour 297</p>
<p>That may give furth’rance 298 to our expedition,</p>
<p>For we have now no thought in us but France,</p>
<p>Save those to 299 God, that run before our business.</p>
<p>Therefore let our proportions 300 for these wars</p>
<p>Be soon collected and all things thought upon</p>
<p>That may with reasonable swiftness add</p>
<p>More feathers to our wings, for, God before 301 ,</p>
<p>We’ll chide 302 this dauphin at his father’s door.</p>
<p>Therefore let every man now task 303 his thought,</p>
<p>That this fair 304 action may on foot be brought 305 .</p>
<p>Flourish 306 . Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
<p>Enter Chorus</p>
<p>CHORUS Now all the youth of England are on fire 307 ,</p>
<p>And silken dalliance 308 in the wardrobe lies:</p>
<p>Now thrive the armourers, and honour’s thought</p>
<p>Reigns solely in the breast of every man.</p>
<p>They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,</p>
<p>Following the mirror 309 of all Christian kings,</p>
<p>With wingèd heels, as English Mercuries 310 .</p>
<p>For now sits expectation in the air,</p>
<p>And hides a sword from hilts 311 unto the point</p>
<p>With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets 312 ,</p>
<p>Promised to Harry and his followers.</p>
<p>The French, advised by good intelligence 313</p>
<p>Of this most dreadful preparation 314 ,</p>
<p>Shake in their fear and with pale 315 policy 316</p>
<p>Seek to divert the English purposes.</p>
<p>O England! Model to 317 thy inward greatness,</p>
<p>Like little body with a mighty heart,</p>
<p>What 318 mightst thou do, that honour would 319 thee do,</p>
<p>Were all thy children 320 kind 321 and natural?</p>
<p>But see, thy fault France hath in thee found out,</p>
<p>A nest of hollow 322 bosoms 323 , which he fills</p>
<p>With treacherous crowns 324 , and three corrupted men:</p>
<p>One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,</p>
<p>Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,</p>
<p>Have, for the gilt 325 of France —— O guilt indeed! ——</p>
<p>Confirmed conspiracy with fearful 326 France,</p>
<p>And by their hands this grace of kings 327 must die,</p>
<p>If hell and treason hold their promises,</p>
<p>Ere 328 he take ship for France, and in Southampton 329 .</p>
<p>Linger your patience on, and we’ll digest 330</p>
<p>Th’abuse of distance 331 ; force 332 a play.</p>
<p>The sum is paid, the traitors are agreed,</p>
<p>The king is set from London, and the scene</p>
<p>Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton.</p>
<p>There is the playhouse now, there must you sit,</p>
<p>And thence to France shall we convey you safe,</p>
<p>And bring you back, charming 333 the narrow seas</p>
<p>To give you gentle pass 334 , for if we may,</p>
<p>We’ll not offend one stomach 335 with our play.</p>
<p>But, till the king come forth, and not till then 336 ,</p>
<p>Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
