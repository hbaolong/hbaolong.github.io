<h4 id="scene-2-974-running-scene-8">Scene 2 974 / running scene 8</h4>
<p>Enter Countess and Clown [Lavatch ]</p>
<p>COUNTESS It hath happened all as I would have had it, save that he
comes not along with her.</p>
<p>LAVATCH By my troth 975 , I take my young lord to be a very
melancholy man.</p>
<p>COUNTESS By what observance 976 , I pray you?</p>
<p>LAVATCH Why, he will look upon his boot and sing: mend 977 the ruff
and sing: ask questions and sing: pick his teeth and sing. I know a man
that had this trick of melancholy sold 978 a goodly manor for a
song.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.</p>
<p>Opens a letter</p>
<p>LAVATCH I have no mind to 979 Isbel since I was at court. Our old
lings 980 and our Isbels o’th’country are nothing like your old ling and
your Isbels o’th’court. The brains 981 of my Cupid’s knocked out, and I
begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach 982 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS What have we here?</p>
<p>LAVATCH E’en 983 that you have there.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>COUNTESS</p>
<p>[Reads ] a letter</p>
<p>‘I have sent you a daughter-in-law. She hath recovered 984 the king,
and undone me. I have wedded her, not 985 bedded her, and sworn to make
the “not“ eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know it before the
report come. If there be breadth enough in the world, I will hold 986 a
long distance. My duty to you. Your unfortunate son, Bertram.’</p>
<p>This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.</p>
<p>To fly 987 the favours of so good a king,</p>
<p>To pluck his indignation on thy head</p>
<p>By the misprizing 988 of a maid too virtuous</p>
<p>For the contempt of empire 989 .</p>
<p>Enter Clown [Lavatch ]</p>
<p>LAVATCH O, madam, yonder is heavy 990 news within 991 , between two
soldiers and my young lady!</p>
<p>COUNTESS What is the matter?</p>
<p>LAVATCH Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort. Your
son will not be killed so soon as I thought he would.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Why should he be killed?</p>
<p>LAVATCH So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does. The
danger is in standing to’t 992 . That’s the loss of men, though it be
the getting 993 of children. Here they come will tell you more. For my
part, I only hear your son was run away.</p>
<p>[He may exit ]</p>
<p>Enter Helen and two Gentlemen [First and Second Lords Dumaine ]</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Save 994 you, good madam.</p>
<p>HELEN Madam, my lord is gone, forever gone.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Do not say so.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,</p>
<p>I have felt so many quirks 995 of joy and grief</p>
<p>That the first face 996 of neither, on the start 997</p>
<p>Can woman 998 me unto’t. Where is my son, I pray you?</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Madam, he’s gone to serve the Duke of Florence:</p>
<p>We met him thitherward 999 , for thence 1000 we came,</p>
<p>And after some dispatch in hand 1001 at court,</p>
<p>Thither we bend 1002 again.</p>
<p>HELEN Look on his letter, madam, here’s my passport 1003 .</p>
<p>Shows a letter</p>
<p>‘When thou canst get the ring upon my finger, which never shall come
off, and show me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to, then
call me husband. But in such a “then“ I write a “never“.’ This is a
dreadful sentence 1004 .</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>COUNTESS Brought you this letter, gentlemen?</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Ay, madam, and for the contents’ sake are sorry for our
pains.</p>
<p>COUNTESS I prithee, lady, have a better cheer 1005 .</p>
<p>If thou engrossest 1006 all the griefs are 1007 thine,</p>
<p>Thou robb’st me of a moiety 1008 : he was my son,</p>
<p>But I do wash his name out of my blood,</p>
<p>And thou art all my 1009 child. Towards Florence is he?</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Ay, madam.</p>
<p>COUNTESS And to be a soldier?</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Such is his noble purpose, and believe’t,</p>
<p>The duke will lay upon him all the honour</p>
<p>That good convenience 1010 claims.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Return you thither?</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.</p>
<p>HELEN ‘Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>’Tis bitter.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Find you that there?</p>
<p>HELEN Ay, madam.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD ’Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply 1011 , which his
heart was not consenting to.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Nothing in France, until he have no wife!</p>
<p>There’s nothing here that is too good for him</p>
<p>But only she, and she deserves a lord</p>
<p>That twenty such rude 1012 boys might tend upon</p>
<p>And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?</p>
<p>SECOND LORD A servant only, and a gentleman</p>
<p>Which I have sometime known.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Parolles, was it not?</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Ay, my good lady, he.</p>
<p>COUNTESS A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.</p>
<p>My son corrupts a well-derivèd 1013 nature</p>
<p>With his inducement 1014 .</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Indeed, good lady,</p>
<p>The fellow has a deal 1015 of that 1016 too much,</p>
<p>Which holds him much to have 1017 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS You’re welcome, gentlemen.</p>
<p>I will entreat you, when you see my son,</p>
<p>To tell him that his sword can never win</p>
<p>The honour that he loses: more I’ll entreat you</p>
<p>Written 1018 to bear along.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD We serve you, madam,</p>
<p>In that and all your worthiest affairs.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Not so, but as we change 1019 our courtesies 1020 .</p>
<p>Will you draw near 1021 ?</p>
<p>Exeunt [all but Helen ]</p>
<p>HELEN ‘Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.’</p>
<p>Nothing in France, until he has no wife!</p>
<p>Thou shalt have none, Rossillion 1022 , none in France.</p>
<p>Then hast thou all again. Poor lord, is’t I</p>
<p>That chase thee from thy country and expose</p>
<p>Those tender limbs of thine to the event 1023</p>
<p>Of the none-sparing war? And is it I</p>
<p>That drive thee from the sportive 1024 court, where thou</p>
<p>Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark 1025</p>
<p>Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers 1026</p>
<p>That ride upon the violent speed of fire,</p>
<p>Fly with false aim, move 1027 the still-peering 1028 air</p>
<p>That sings 1029 with piercing. Do not touch my lord.</p>
<p>Whoever shoots at him, I set him there 1030 .</p>
<p>Whoever charges on his forward 1031 breast,</p>
<p>I am the caitiff 1032 that do hold him to’t,</p>
<p>And though I kill him not, I am the cause</p>
<p>His death was so effected. Better ’twere</p>
<p>I met the ravin 1033 lion when he roared</p>
<p>With sharp constraint 1034 of hunger: better ’twere</p>
<p>That all the miseries which nature owes 1035</p>
<p>Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rossillion,</p>
<p>Whence honour but of danger wins a scar 1036 ,</p>
<p>As oft 1037 it loses all 1038 . I will be gone:</p>
<p>My being here it is that holds thee hence.</p>
<p>Shall I stay here to do’t 1039 ? No, no, although 1040</p>
<p>The air of paradise did fan the house</p>
<p>And angels officed all 1041 . I will be gone,</p>
<p>That pitiful 1042 rumour may report my flight,</p>
<p>To consolate 1043 thine ear. Come night, end day!</p>
<p>For with the dark, poor thief, I’ll steal 1044 away.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
