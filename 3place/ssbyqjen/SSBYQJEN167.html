<h4 id="scene-1-1-running-scene-1">Scene 1 1 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter Antonio, Salerio and Solanio</p>
<p>ANTONIO In sooth 2 I know not why I am so sad.</p>
<p>It wearies me, you say it wearies you;</p>
<p>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</p>
<p>What stuff 3 ’tis made of, whereof it is born 4 ,</p>
<p>I am to learn 5 :</p>
<p>And such a want-wit 6 sadness makes of me</p>
<p>That I have much ado 7 to know myself.</p>
<p>SALERIO Your mind is tossing on 8 the ocean,</p>
<p>There where your argosies 9 with portly 10 sail 11</p>
<p>Like signiors 12 and rich burghers 13 on the flood 14 ,</p>
<p>Or as it were the pageants 15 of the sea,</p>
<p>Do overpeer 16 the petty traffickers 17</p>
<p>That curtsy 18 to them, do them reverence 19 ,</p>
<p>As they fly 20 by them with their woven wings 21 .</p>
<p>SOLANIO Believe me, sir, had I such venture 22 forth 23 ,</p>
<p>The better part 24 of my affections 25 would</p>
<p>Be with my hopes 26 abroad. I should be still 27</p>
<p>Plucking the grass to know where sits 28 the wind,</p>
<p>Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads 29 ,</p>
<p>And every object that might make me fear</p>
<p>Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt</p>
<p>Would make me sad.</p>
<p>SALERIO My wind cooling my broth</p>
<p>Would blow me to an ague 30 , when I thought</p>
<p>What harm a wind too great might do at sea.</p>
<p>I should 31 not see the sandy hour-glass run,</p>
<p>But I should think of shallows and of flats 32 ,</p>
<p>And see my wealthy Andrew 33 docked in sand,</p>
<p>Vailing 34 her high top 35 lower than her ribs 36</p>
<p>To kiss her burial 37 ; should I 38 go to church</p>
<p>And see the holy edifice of stone,</p>
<p>And not bethink me straight 39 of dang’rous rocks,</p>
<p>Which touching but 40 my gentle 41 vessel’s side,</p>
<p>Would scatter all her spices on the stream 42 ,</p>
<p>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks 43 ,</p>
<p>And in a word, but even 44 now worth this 45 ,</p>
<p>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</p>
<p>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</p>
<p>That such a thing bechanced 46 would make me sad?</p>
<p>But tell not me, I know, Antonio</p>
<p>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it,</p>
<p>My ventures are not in one bottom 47 trusted,</p>
<p>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate 48</p>
<p>Upon 49 the fortune 50 of this present year:</p>
<p>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</p>
<p>SALERIO Why, then you are in love.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Fie 51 , fie!</p>
<p>SOLANIO Not in love neither: then let us say you are sad</p>
<p>Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy</p>
<p>For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry</p>
<p>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus 52 ,</p>
<p>Nature hath framed 53 strange fellows in her time:</p>
<p>Some that will evermore peep 54 through their eyes</p>
<p>And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper 55 ,</p>
<p>And other 56 of such vinegar aspect 57</p>
<p>That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile,</p>
<p>Though 58 Nestor 59 swear the jest be laughable.</p>
<p>Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo and Gratiano 60</p>
<p>SOLANIO Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,</p>
<p>Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well,</p>
<p>We leave you now with better company.</p>
<p>SALERIO I would have stayed till I had made you merry,</p>
<p>If worthier friends had not prevented 61 me.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Your worth is very dear 62 in my regard 63 .</p>
<p>I take it your own business calls on you,</p>
<p>And you embrace 64 th’occasion 65 to depart.</p>
<p>SALERIO Good morrow, my good lords.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Good signiors both, when shall we laugh 66 ? Say, when?</p>
<p>You grow exceeding strange 67 . Must it be so?</p>
<p>SALERIO We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours 68 .</p>
<p>Exeunt Salerio and Solanio</p>
<p>LORENZO My lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,</p>
<p>We two will leave you, but at dinnertime</p>
<p>I pray you have in mind 69 where we must meet.</p>
<p>BASSANIO I will not fail you.</p>
<p>GRATIANO You look not well, Signior Antonio.</p>
<p>You have too much respect upon the world 70 :</p>
<p>They lose it 71 that do buy it with much care 72 .</p>
<p>Believe me, you are marvellously 73 changed.</p>
<p>ANTONIO I hold 74 the world but as the world, Gratiano,</p>
<p>A stage where every man must play a part,</p>
<p>And mine a sad one.</p>
<p>GRATIANO Let me play the fool:</p>
<p>With mirth and laughter let old 75 wrinkles come,</p>
<p>And let my liver 76 rather heat with wine</p>
<p>Than my heart cool with mortifying 77 groans 78 .</p>
<p>Why should a man whose blood is warm within,</p>
<p>Sit like his grandsire 79 cut in alabaster 80 ?</p>
<p>Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundices 81</p>
<p>By being peevish 82 ? I tell thee what, Antonio —</p>
<p>I love thee, and it is my love that speaks —</p>
<p>There are a sort of men whose visages 83</p>
<p>Do cream and mantle 84 like a standing 85 pond,</p>
<p>And do a wilful 86 stillness 87 entertain 88 ,</p>
<p>With purpose to be dressed in an opinion 89</p>
<p>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit 90 ,</p>
<p>As who should say 91 , ’I am, sir, an oracle,</p>
<p>And when I ope 92 my lips, let no dog bark!’</p>
<p>O my Antonio, I do know of these</p>
<p>That therefore only are reputed wise</p>
<p>For saying nothing; when I am very sure</p>
<p>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears</p>
<p>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools 93 .</p>
<p>I’ll tell thee more of this another time.</p>
<p>But fish not with this melancholy bait 94</p>
<p>For this fool 95 gudgeon 96 , this opinion.</p>
<p>Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile,</p>
<p>I’ll end my exhortation 97 after dinner.</p>
<p>LORENZO Well, we will leave you then till dinnertime.</p>
<p>To Antonio and Bassanio</p>
<p>I must be one of these same dumb 98 wise men,</p>
<p>For Gratiano never lets me speak.</p>
<p>GRATIANO Well, keep me company but two years more,</p>
<p>Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Fare you well, I’ll grow 99 a talker for this gear 100 .</p>
<p>GRATIANO Thanks, i’faith, for silence is only commendable</p>
<p>In a neat’s tongue dried 101 and a maid not vendible 102 .</p>
<p>Exit [Gratiano with Lorenzo ]</p>
<p>ANTONIO Is that anything now? 103</p>
<p>BASSANIO Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any
man in all Venice. His reasons 104 are two grains of wheat hid in two
bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere 105 you find them, and when
you have them, they are not worth the</p>
<p>search.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Well, tell me now, what lady is the same 106</p>
<p>To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage</p>
<p>That you today promised to tell me of ?</p>
<p>BASSANIO ’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,</p>
<p>How much I have disabled 107 mine estate</p>
<p>By something 108 showing a more swelling port 109</p>
<p>Than my faint 110 means would grant continuance 111 .</p>
<p>Nor do I now make moan 112 to be abridged 113</p>
<p>From such a noble rate 114 , but my chief care 115</p>
<p>Is to come fairly off from 116 the great debts</p>
<p>Wherein my time 117 something too prodigal 118</p>
<p>Hath left me gaged 119 . To you, Antonio,</p>
<p>I owe the most in money and in love,</p>
<p>And from your love I have a warranty 120</p>
<p>To unburden 121 all my plots and purposes</p>
<p>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</p>
<p>ANTONIO I pray you good Bassanio, let me know it,</p>
<p>And if it stand as you yourself still do,</p>
<p>Within the eye of honour 122 , be assured</p>
<p>My purse, my person, my extremest means,</p>
<p>Lie all unlocked to your occasions 123 .</p>
<p>BASSANIO In my schooldays, when I had lost one shaft 124 ,</p>
<p>I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight 125</p>
<p>The selfsame way with more advisèd 126 watch</p>
<p>To find the other forth 127 , and by adventuring 128 both</p>
<p>I oft found both. I urge 129 this childhood proof 130</p>
<p>Because what follows is pure innocence 131 .</p>
<p>I owe you much and, like a wilful youth,</p>
<p>That which I owe is lost. But if you please</p>
<p>To shoot another arrow that self 132 way</p>
<p>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</p>
<p>As I will watch the aim, or 133 to find both,</p>
<p>Or bring your latter hazard 134 back again,</p>
<p>And thankfully rest 135 debtor for the first.</p>
<p>ANTONIO You know me well, and herein spend but 136 time</p>
<p>To wind about my love with circumstance 137 ,</p>
<p>And out of 138 doubt you do me now more wrong</p>
<p>In making question of my uttermost 139</p>
<p>Than if you had made waste 140 of all I have.</p>
<p>Then do but 141 say to me what I should do</p>
<p>That in your knowledge may by me be done,</p>
<p>And I am pressed 142 unto it: therefore speak.</p>
<p>BASSANIO In Belmont is a lady richly left 143 ,</p>
<p>And she is fair and, fairer than that word,</p>
<p>Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes 144 from her eyes</p>
<p>I did receive fair speechless messages.</p>
<p>Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued</p>
<p>To 145 Cato 146 ‘s daughter, Brutus 147’ Portia.</p>
<p>Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,</p>
<p>For the four winds blow in from every coast</p>
<p>Renownèd suitors, and her sunny locks</p>
<p>Hang on her temples like a golden fleece 148 ,</p>
<p>Which makes her seat 149 of Belmont Colchos’ strand 150 ,</p>
<p>And many Jasons come in quest of her.</p>
<p>O my Antonio, had I but the means</p>
<p>To hold a rival place with one of them,</p>
<p>I have a mind presages 151 me such thrift 152 ,</p>
<p>That I should questionless 153 be fortunate.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea,</p>
<p>Neither have I money, nor commodity 154</p>
<p>To raise a present 155 sum: therefore go forth.</p>
<p>Try 156 what my credit can in Venice do,</p>
<p>That shall be racked 157 , even to the uttermost,</p>
<p>To furnish thee 158 to Belmont, to fair Portia.</p>
<p>Go presently 159 inquire, and so will I,</p>
<p>Where money is, and I no question make</p>
<p>To have it of my trust 160 or for my sake 161 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
