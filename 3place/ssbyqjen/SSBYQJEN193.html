<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-1">Scene 1 ／ running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter Orlando and Adam 1</p>
<p>ORLANDO As I remember, Adam 2 , it was upon this fashion bequeathed
me by will but poor 3 a thousand crowns 4 , and, as thou sayest, charged
5 my brother on his blessing to breed 6 me well: and there begins my
sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school 7 , and report speaks
goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or,
to speak more properly, stays 8 me here at home unkept 9 , for call you
that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the
stalling 10 of an ox? His horses are bred better, for, besides that they
are fair 11 with their feeding, they are taught their manage 12 , and to
that end riders 13 dearly 14 hired: but I, his brother, gain nothing
under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as
much bound 15 to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully
gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance 16 seems to
take from me: he lets me feed with his hinds 17 , bars me the place of a
brother, and, as much as in him lies 18 , mines my gentility 19 with my
education. This is it, Adam, that grieves 20 me. And the spirit of my
father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy
how to avoid 21 it.</p>
<p>Enter Oliver</p>
<p>ADAM Yonder comes my master, your brother.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Go apart 22 , Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me
up 23 .</p>
<p>Adam stands aside</p>
<p>OLIVER Now, sir, what make 24 you here?</p>
<p>ORLANDO Nothing: I am not taught to make anything.</p>
<p>OLIVER What mar 25 you then, sir?</p>
<p>ORLANDO Marry 26 , sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made,
a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</p>
<p>OLIVER Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile 27 .</p>
<p>ORLANDO Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them? What prodigal
portion 28 have I spent that I should come to such penury?</p>
<p>OLIVER Know you where you are, sir?</p>
<p>ORLANDO O, sir, very well: here in your orchard 29 .</p>
<p>OLIVER Know you before whom, sir?</p>
<p>ORLANDO Ay, better than him I am before knows 30 me. I know you are
my eldest brother, and, in the gentle condition of blood 31 , you should
so know me. The courtesy of nations 32 allows you my better, in that you
are the first-born, but the same tradition 33 takes not away my blood 34
, were there twenty brothers betwixt us: I have as much of my father in
me as you, albeit I confess your coming before me is nearer to his
reverence 35 .</p>
<p>OLIVER What, boy!</p>
<p>Raises his hand or hits him</p>
<p>ORLANDO Come, come, elder brother, you are too young 36 in this.</p>
<p>Grabs him</p>
<p>OLIVER Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain 37 ?</p>
<p>ORLANDO I am no villain: I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Bois
38 , he was my father, and he is thrice a villain that says such a
father begot 39 villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not take
this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for
saying so. Thou hast railed on 40 thyself.</p>
<p>ADAM Sweet masters, be patient: for your father’s remembrance 41 , be
at accord.</p>
<p>OLIVER Let me go, I say.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My father
charged you in his will to give me good education: you have trained me
like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
qualities 42 . The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no
longer endure it: therefore allow me such exercises 43 as may become 44
a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery 45 my father left me by
testament 46 , with that I will 47 go buy my fortunes.</p>
<p>Lets him go</p>
<p>OLIVER And what wilt thou do? Beg when that is spent? Well, sir, get
you in. I will not long be troubled with you. You shall have some part
of your will. I pray you leave me.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I will no further offend 48 you than becomes me for my
good.</p>
<p>OLIVER Get you with him, you old dog.</p>
<p>To Adam</p>
<p>ADAM Is ‘old dog’ my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in your
service. God be with my old master, he would not have spoke such a
word.</p>
<p>Exeunt Orlando [and ] Adam</p>
<p>OLIVER Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon 49 me? I will physic 50
your rankness 51 , and yet give no thousand crowns neither 52 . Holla 53
, Dennis!</p>
<p>Enter Dennis</p>
<p>DENNIS Calls your worship?</p>
<p>OLIVER Was not Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with
me?</p>
<p>DENNIS So 54 please you, he is here at the door and importunes 55
access to you.</p>
<p>OLIVER Call him in.</p>
<p>[Exit Dennis ]</p>
<p>’Twill be a good way, and tomorrow 56 the wrestling is.</p>
<p>Enter Charles</p>
<p>CHARLES Good morrow to your worship.</p>
<p>OLIVER Good Monsieur Charles, what’s the new news at the new
court?</p>
<p>CHARLES There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old news: that is,
the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke, and three
or four loving 57 lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with
him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke, therefore he gives
them good leave 58 to wander.</p>
<p>OLIVER Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke’s daughter, be banished
with her father?</p>
<p>CHARLES O, no; for the duke’s daughter, her cousin, so loves her,
being ever 59 from their cradles bred together, that she would have
followed her exile, or have died to stay 60 behind her; she is at the
court, and no less beloved 61 of her uncle than his own daughter, and
never two ladies loved as they do.</p>
<p>OLIVER Where will the old duke live?</p>
<p>CHARLES They say he is already in the Forest of Arden 62 , and a many
merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood 63 of
England: they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet
64 the time carelessly 65 as they did in the golden world 66 .</p>
<p>OLIVER What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke?</p>
<p>CHARLES Marry do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter. I
am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando
hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall 67 .
Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit 68 , and he that escapes me
without some broken limb shall acquit him well. Your brother is but
young and tender 69 , and for your love I would be loath to foil 70 him,
as I must for my own honour if he come in: therefore, out of my love to
you, I came hither to acquaint you withal 71 , that either you might
stay him from his intendment 72 , or brook 73 such disgrace well as he
shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search 74 and
altogether against my will.</p>
<p>OLIVER Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt
find I will most kindly requite 75 . I had myself notice of my brother’s
purpose herein and have by underhand 76 means laboured to dissuade him
from it; but he is resolute. I’ll tell thee, Charles, it is the
stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious
emulator 77 of every man’s good parts 78 , a secret and villainous
contriver against me his natural brother: therefore use thy discretion.
I had as lief 79 thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert
best look to’t 80 ; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he
do not mightily grace himself on thee 81 , he will practise 82 against
thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device 83 and never
leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by some indirect means or other,
for I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not one so
young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly of him,
but should I anatomize 84 him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep
and thou must look pale and wonder.</p>
<p>CHARLES I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come tomorrow,
I’ll give him his payment 85 . If ever he go alone 86 again, I’ll never
wrestle for prize more. And so God keep your worship!</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>OLIVER Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester 87 : I
hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why, hates
nothing more than he. Yet he’s gentle 88 , never schooled and yet
learnèd, full of noble device 89 , of all sorts 90 enchantingly beloved,
and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprised 91 . But it
shall not be so long: this wrestler shall clear 92 all. Nothing remains
but that I kindle the boy thither 93 , which now I’ll go about.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
