<h4 id="scene-1-1-running-scene-1">Scene 1 1 ／ running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter Justice Shallow, Slender [and ] Sir 2 Hugh Evans</p>
<p>SHALLOW Sir Hugh, persuade 3 me not. I will make a Star Chamber 4
matter of it. If he were twenty Sir John Falstaffs, he shall not abuse
Robert Shallow, esquire.</p>
<p>SLENDER In the county of Gloucester, Justice of Peace and Coram 5
.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Ay, cousin 6 Slender, and Custalorum 7 .</p>
<p>SLENDER Ay, and Rato-lorum 8 too; and a gentleman born, master
parson, who writes himself Armigero 9 in any bill 10 , warrant 11 ,
quittance 12 or obligation 13 , Armigero .</p>
<p>SHALLOW Ay, that I do, and have done any time these three hundred
years.</p>
<p>SLENDER All his successors — gone before him — hath done’t, and all
his ancestors — that come after him — may. They may give 14 the dozen
white luces 15 in their coat 16 .</p>
<p>SHALLOW It is an old coat.</p>
<p>EVANS The dozen white louses do become 17 an old coat well. It agrees
well passant 18 . It is a familiar 19 beast to man, and signifies
love.</p>
<p>SHALLOW The luce is the fresh fish. The salt fish is an old coat 20
.</p>
<p>SLENDER I may quarter 21 , coz 22 .</p>
<p>SHALLOW You may, by marrying.</p>
<p>EVANS It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Not a whit.</p>
<p>EVANS Yes, py’r lady 23 : if he has a quarter of your coat, there is
but three skirts 24 for yourself, in my simple conjectures. But that is
all one: if Sir John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto you, I
am of the church, and will be glad to do my benevolence 25 , to make
atonements 26 and compromises 27 between you.</p>
<p>SHALLOW The Council 28 shall hear it, it is a riot.</p>
<p>EVANS It is not meet 29 the Council hear a riot: there is no fear of
Got 30 in a riot. The Council, look you, shall desire to hear the fear
of Got, and not to hear a riot. Take your vizaments 31 in that 32 .</p>
<p>SHALLOW Ha, o’my life, if I were young again, the sword 33 should end
it.</p>
<p>EVANS It is petter that friends is the sword, and end it. And there
is also another device 34 in my prain, which peradventure 35 prings goot
discretions 36 with it. There is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master
Thomas 37 Page, which is pretty virginity.</p>
<p>SLENDER Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks small 38
like a woman.</p>
<p>EVANS It is that fery 39 person for all the ’orld 40 , as just 41 as
you will desire, and seven hundred pounds of moneys, and gold and
silver, is 42 her grandsire upon his death’s-bed — Got deliver to a
joyful resurrections! — give 43 , when she is able to overtake seventeen
years old. It were a goot motion 44 , if we leave our pribbles and
prabbles 45 , and desire a marriage between Master Abraham and Mistress
Anne Page.</p>
<p>SLENDER Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?</p>
<p>EVANS Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny 46 .</p>
<p>SLENDER 47 I know the young gentlewoman: she has good gifts 48 .</p>
<p>EVANS Seven hundred pounds, and possibilities 49 , is goot gifts.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Well, let us see honest 50 Master Page. Is Falstaff
there?</p>
<p>EVANS Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do despise one
that is false, or as I despise one that is not true. The knight, Sir
John, is there, and I beseech you, be ruled by your well-willers 51 . I
will peat the door for Master Page.</p>
<p>Knocks</p>
<p>What, ho! Got pless your house here!</p>
<p>PAGE Who’s there?</p>
<p>Speaks within and then enters</p>
<p>EVANS Here is Got’s plessing, and your friend, and Justice Shallow,
and here young Master Slender, that peradventures shall tell you another
tale 52 , if matters grow to your likings.</p>
<p>PAGE I am glad to see your worships well. I thank you for my venison,
Master Shallow.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Master Page, I am glad to see you: much good do it your good
heart. I wished your venison better, it was ill 53 killed. How doth good
Mistress Page? And I thank you always with my heart, la 54 — with my
heart.</p>
<p>PAGE Sir, I thank you.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Sir, I thank you: by yea and no 55 , I do.</p>
<p>PAGE I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.</p>
<p>SLENDER How does your fallow 56 greyhound, sir? I heard say he was
outrun on Cotsall 57 .</p>
<p>PAGE It could not be judged 58 , sir.</p>
<p>SLENDER You’ll not confess, you’ll not confess.</p>
<p>SHALLOW That he will not. — ’Tis your fault 59 , ’tis your fault. —
’Tis a good dog.</p>
<p>Aside to Slender/To Page</p>
<p>PAGE A cur 60 , sir.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Sir, he’s a good dog, and a fair dog, can there be more said?
He is good and fair. Is Sir John Falstaff here?</p>
<p>PAGE Sir, he is within: and I would 61 I could do a good office 62
between you.</p>
<p>EVANS It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.</p>
<p>SHALLOW He hath wronged me, Master Page.</p>
<p>PAGE Sir, he doth in some sort 63 confess it.</p>
<p>SHALLOW If it be confessed, it is not redressed. Is not that so,
Master Page? He hath wronged me, indeed he hath, at 64 a word, he hath.
Believe me: Robert Shallow esquire saith he is wronged.</p>
<p>PAGE Here comes Sir John.</p>
<p>[Enter Falstaff, Bardolph, Nim and Pistol 65 ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Now, Master Shallow, you’ll complain of me to the king?</p>
<p>SHALLOW Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and broke
open my lodge 66 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF But not kissed your keeper’s 67 daughter?</p>
<p>SHALLOW Tut, a pin 68 ! This shall be answered 69 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I will answer it straight 70 : I have done all this. That is
now answered.</p>
<p>SHALLOW The Council shall know this.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF ’Twere better for you if it were known in counsel 71 .
You’ll be laughed at.</p>
<p>EVANS Pauca verba 72 , Sir John, goot worts 73 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Good worts? Good cabbage. Slender, I broke 74 your head.
What matter 75 have you against me?</p>
<p>SLENDER Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you, and against
your cony-catching 76 rascals, Bardolph, Nim and Pistol.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH You Banbury cheese 77 !</p>
<p>SLENDER Ay, it is no matter 78 .</p>
<p>PISTOL How now, Mephostophilus 79 ?</p>
<p>SLENDER Ay, it is no matter.</p>
<p>NIM Slice 80 , I say! Pauca 81 , pauca . Slice, that’s my humour 82
.</p>
<p>SLENDER Where’s Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?</p>
<p>EVANS Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is three
umpires in this matter, as I understand; that is, Master Page —
fidelicet 83 Master Page — and there is myself — fidelicet myself — and
the three 84 party is — lastly and finally — mine host 85 of the Garter
86 .</p>
<p>PAGE We three to hear it and end it between them.</p>
<p>EVANS Fery goot, I will make a prief 87 of it in my note-book, and we
will afterwards ’ork 88 upon the cause with as great discreetly 89 as we
can.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Pistol!</p>
<p>PISTOL He hears with ears.</p>
<p>EVANS The tevil and his tam 90 ! What phrase is this? He hears with
ear? Why, it is affectations.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Pistol, did you pick Master Slender’s purse?</p>
<p>SLENDER Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might never come in
mine own great chamber 91 again else, of seven groats 92 in
mill-sixpences 93 , and two Edward shovel-boards 94 , that cost me two
shilling and two pence apiece of Yead 95 Miller, by these gloves.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Is this true, Pistol?</p>
<p>EVANS No, it is false 96 , if it is a pick-purse.</p>
<p>PISTOL Ha, thou mountain-foreigner 97 ! Sir John and master mine,</p>
<p>I combat challenge 98 of this latten 99 bilbo 100 .</p>
<p>Word of denial in thy labras 101 here!</p>
<p>Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!</p>
<p>SLENDER By these gloves, then, ’twas he.</p>
<p>Points to Nim</p>
<p>NIM Be avised 102 , sir, and pass good humours 103 : I will say
‘marry 104 trap’ 105 with you, if you run the nuthook 106 ’s humour on
me 107 . That is the very note 108 of it.</p>
<p>SLENDER By this hat, then, he in the red face 109 had it: for though
I cannot remember what I did when you made me drunk, yet I am not
altogether an ass.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What say you, Scarlet and John 110 ?</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman had drunk himself
out of his five sentences.</p>
<p>EVANS It is his five senses. Fie, what the ignorance is!</p>
<p>BARDOLPH And being fap 111 , sir, was, as they say, cashiered 112 :
and so conclusions passed the careers 113 .</p>
<p>SLENDER Ay, you spake in Latin then too. But ’tis no matter. I’ll
ne’er be drunk whilst I live again, but in honest, civil, godly company,
for this trick. If I be drunk, I’ll be drunk with those that have the
fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.</p>
<p>EVANS So Got ’udge 114 me, that is a virtuous mind 115 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen, you hear
it.</p>
<p>[Enter Anne, with wine ]</p>
<p>PAGE Nay, daughter, carry the wine in: we’ll drink within.</p>
<p>[Exit Anne ]</p>
<p>SLENDER O heaven, this is Mistress Anne Page!</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>[Enter Mistress Ford and Mistress Page ]</p>
<p>PAGE How now, Mistress Ford?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met. By your
leave 116 , good mistress.</p>
<p>Kisses her</p>
<p>PAGE Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a hot venison
pasty to 117 dinner. Come, gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down all
unkindness.</p>
<p>[Exeunt all except Shallow, Slender and Evans ]</p>
<p>SLENDER I had rather than forty shillings I had my book of Songs and
Sonnets 118 here.</p>
<p>[Enter Simple ]</p>
<p>How now, Simple, where have you been? I must wait on myself, must I?
You have not the Book of 119 Riddles about you, have you?</p>
<p>SIMPLE Book of Riddles ? Why, did you not lend it to Alice Shortcake
upon Allhallowmas 120 last, a fortnight afore Michaelmas 121 ?</p>
<p>SHALLOW Come, coz. Come, coz, we stay 122 for you. A word with you,
coz. Marry, this,</p>
<p>coz: there is, as ’twere, a tender 123 , a kind of tender, made afar
off 124 by Sir Hugh here.</p>
<p>Do you understand me?</p>
<p>SLENDER Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable. If it be so, I shall
do that that is reason 125 .</p>
<p>SHALLOW Nay, but understand me.</p>
<p>SLENDER So I do, sir.</p>
<p>EVANS Give ear to his motions 126 . Master Slender, I will
description the matter to you, if you be capacity of 127 it.</p>
<p>SLENDER Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says. I pray you pardon
me, he’s a Justice of Peace in his country 128 , simple though I stand
here 129 .</p>
<p>EVANS But that is not the question. The question is concerning your
marriage.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Ay, there’s the point, sir.</p>
<p>EVANS Marry, is it: the very point of it, to Mistress Anne Page.</p>
<p>SLENDER Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any reasonable
demands 130 .</p>
<p>EVANS But can you affection the ’oman 131 ? Let us command to know
that of your mouth or of your lips, for divers 132 philosophers hold
that the lips is parcel 133 of the mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you
carry your good will to 134 the maid?</p>
<p>SHALLOW Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?</p>
<p>SLENDER I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that would do
reason.</p>
<p>EVANS Nay, Got’s lords and his ladies, you must speak possitable 135
, if you can carry her 136 your desires towards her.</p>
<p>SHALLOW That you must. Will you, upon 137 good dowry, marry her?</p>
<p>SLENDER I will do a greater thing than that upon your request,
cousin, in any reason.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Nay, conceive 138 me, conceive me, sweet coz. What I do is to
pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?</p>
<p>SLENDER I will marry her, sir, at your request. But if there be no
great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease 139 it upon better
acquaintance, when we are married, and have more occasion to know one
another. I hope upon familiarity will grow more contempt. But if you say
‘Marry her’, I will marry her—that I am freely dissolved 140 , and
dissolutely 141 .</p>
<p>EVANS It is a fery discretion answer. Save the fall 142 is in the
‘ord 143 ’dissolutely’ — the ‘ort is, according to our meaning,
’resolutely’ — his meaning is good.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Ay, I think my cousin meant well.</p>
<p>SLENDER Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!</p>
<p>SHALLOW Here comes fair Mistress Anne.</p>
<p>[Enter Anne ]</p>
<p>Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne.</p>
<p>ANNE The dinner is on the table, my father desires your worships’
company.</p>
<p>SHALLOW I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.</p>
<p>EVANS ’Od’s plessèd will! I will not be absence at the grace.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Shallow and Evans ]</p>
<p>ANNE Will’t please your worship to come in, sir?</p>
<p>SLENDER No, I thank you, forsooth 144 , heartily. I am very well.</p>
<p>ANNE The dinner attends 145 you, sir.</p>
<p>SLENDER I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth.— Go, sirrah 146 ,
for all 147 you are my man, go wait upon my cousin Shallow.</p>
<p>To Simple</p>
<p>[Exit Simple ]</p>
<p>A justice of peace sometime may be beholding 148 to his friend for a
man. I keep but three men and a boy yet, till my mother be dead: but
what though 149 , yet I live like a poor gentleman born.</p>
<p>ANNE I may not go in without your worship: they will not sit till you
come.</p>
<p>SLENDER I’faith, I’ll eat nothing. I thank you as much as though I
did.</p>
<p>ANNE I pray you, sir, walk in.</p>
<p>SLENDER I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised my shin
th’other day with playing at sword and dagger with a master of fence 150
— three veneys 151 for a dish of stewed prunes 152 — and, by my troth, I
cannot abide the smell of hot meat 153 since. Why do your dogs bark so?
Be there bears i’th’town?</p>
<p>ANNE I think there are, sir. I heard them talked of.</p>
<p>SLENDER I love the sport 154 well, but I shall as soon quarrel at it,
as any man in England. You are afraid if you see the bear loose, are you
not?</p>
<p>ANNE Ay, indeed, sir.</p>
<p>SLENDER That’s meat and drink to me, now. I have seen Sackerson 155
loose twenty times, and have taken him by the chain: but, I warrant 156
you, the women have so cried and shrieked at it that it passed 157 . But
women, indeed, cannot abide ’em: they are very ill-favoured 158 rough
things.</p>
<p>[Enter Page ]</p>
<p>PAGE Come, gentle Master Slender, come: we stay for you.</p>
<p>SLENDER I’ll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.</p>
<p>PAGE By cock and pie 159 , you shall not choose 160 , sir. Come,
come.</p>
<p>SLENDER Nay, pray you lead the way.</p>
<p>PAGE Come on, sir.</p>
<p>SLENDER Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.</p>
<p>ANNE Not I, sir, pray you, keep on 161 .</p>
<p>SLENDER Truly, I will not go first. Truly, la! I will not do you that
wrong.</p>
<p>ANNE I pray you, sir.</p>
<p>SLENDER I’ll rather be unmannerly than troublesome. You do yourself
wrong, indeed, la!</p>
<p>Goes first</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
