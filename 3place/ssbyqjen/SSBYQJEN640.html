continues</h4>
<p>Enter Cymbeline, Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus, Pisanio and
Lords</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made</p>
<p>Preservers of my throne: woe is my heart</p>
<p>That the poor soldier that so richly 1869 fought,</p>
<p>Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked 1870 breast</p>
<p>Stepped before 1871 targes of proof 1872 , cannot be found:</p>
<p>He shall be happy that can find him, if</p>
<p>Our grace 1873 can make him so.</p>
<p>BELARIUS I never saw</p>
<p>Such noble fury in so poor a thing,</p>
<p>Such precious deeds in one that promised nought</p>
<p>But beggary and poor looks.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE No tidings of him?</p>
<p>PISANIO He hath been searched 1874 among the dead and living,</p>
<p>But no trace of him.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE To my grief, I am</p>
<p>The heir of his reward 1875 ,— which I will add</p>
<p>To Belarius and his sons</p>
<p>To you, the liver, heart and brain 1876 of Britain,</p>
<p>By whom I grant 1877 she lives. ’Tis now the time</p>
<p>To ask of whence you are 1878 . Report it.</p>
<p>BELARIUS Sir,</p>
<p>In Cambria 1879 are 1880 we born, and gentlemen:</p>
<p>Further to boast were neither true nor modest,</p>
<p>Unless I add we are honest.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Bow your knees:</p>
<p>They kneel</p>
<p>Arise my knights o’th’battle 1881 , I create you</p>
<p>Companions to our person, and will fit 1882 you</p>
<p>With dignities becoming your estates 1883 .</p>
<p>They rise</p>
<p>Enter Cornelius and Ladies</p>
<p>There’s business 1884 in these faces: why so sadly</p>
<p>Greet you our victory? You look like Romans,</p>
<p>And not o’th’court of Britain.</p>
<p>CORNELIUS Hail, great king!</p>
<p>To sour your happiness, I must report</p>
<p>The queen is dead.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Who worse than a physician</p>
<p>Would this report become? But I consider</p>
<p>By med’cine life may be prolonged, yet death</p>
<p>Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?</p>
<p>CORNELIUS With horror, madly dying, like her life,</p>
<p>Which, being cruel to the world, concluded</p>
<p>Most cruel to herself. What she confessed</p>
<p>I will report, so please you. These her women</p>
<p>Can trip me 1885 if I err, who with wet cheeks</p>
<p>Were present when she finished.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Prithee, say.</p>
<p>CORNELIUS First, she confessed she never loved you, only</p>
<p>Affected 1886 greatness got by 1887 you, not you:</p>
<p>Married your royalty, was wife to your place,</p>
<p>Abhorred your person.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE She alone knew this;</p>
<p>And, but 1888 she spoke it dying, I would not</p>
<p>Believe her lips in opening 1889 it. Proceed.</p>
<p>CORNELIUS Your daughter, whom she bore in hand 1890 to love</p>
<p>With such integrity, she did confess</p>
<p>Was as a scorpion to her sight, whose life,</p>
<p>But that her flight prevented it, she had</p>
<p>Ta’en off 1891 by poison.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE O most delicate 1892 fiend!</p>
<p>Who is’t can read a woman? Is there more?</p>
<p>CORNELIUS More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had</p>
<p>For you a mortal mineral 1893 , which being took,</p>
<p>Should by the minute 1894 feed on life, and, ling’ring,</p>
<p>By inches waste you 1895 . In which time, she purposed 1896</p>
<p>By watching 1897 , weeping, tendance 1898 , kissing, to</p>
<p>O’ercome you with her show 1899 ; and in time,</p>
<p>When she had fitted 1900 you with her craft, to work</p>
<p>Her son into th’adoption of the crown 1901 :</p>
<p>But, failing of her end 1902 by his strange absence,</p>
<p>Grew shameless-desperate, opened 1903 , in despite</p>
<p>Of heaven and men, her purposes, repented</p>
<p>The evils she hatched were not effected: so</p>
<p>Despairing died.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Heard you all this, her women?</p>
<p>LADY We did, so please your highness.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Mine eyes</p>
<p>Were not in fault, for she was beautiful,</p>
<p>Mine ears 1904 , that heard her flattery, nor my heart,</p>
<p>That thought her like her seeming 1905 . It had been vicious 1906</p>
<p>To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter,</p>
<p>That it was folly in me thou mayst say,</p>
<p>And prove it in thy feeling 1907 . Heaven mend all!</p>
<p>Enter Lucius, Iachimo, [the Soothsayer] and other Roman prisoners,
[Posthumus] Leonatus behind, and Innogen</p>
<p>Thou com’st not, Caius, now for tribute. That</p>
<p>The Britons have razed out 1908 , though with the loss</p>
<p>Of many a bold one: whose kinsmen have made suit 1909</p>
<p>That their 1910 good souls may be appeased with slaughter</p>
<p>Of you their captives, which ourself have granted,</p>
<p>So think of your estate 1911 .</p>
<p>LUCIUS Consider, sir, the chance of war. The day</p>
<p>Was yours by accident: had it gone with us 1912 ,</p>
<p>We should not, when the blood was cool, have threatened</p>
<p>Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods</p>
<p>Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives</p>
<p>May be called 1913 ransom, let it come: sufficeth 1914</p>
<p>A Roman with a Roman’s heart can suffer:</p>
<p>Augustus lives to think on’t 1915 : and so much</p>
<p>For my peculiar care 1916 . This one thing only</p>
<p>I will entreat: my boy, a Briton born,</p>
<p>Let him be ransomed: never master had</p>
<p>A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,</p>
<p>So tender over his occasions 1917 , true,</p>
<p>So feat 1918 , so nurse-like: let his virtue join</p>
<p>With my request, which I’ll make bold your highness</p>
<p>Cannot deny: he hath done no Briton harm,</p>
<p>Though he have served a Roman. Save him, sir,</p>
<p>And 1919 spare no blood beside.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE I have surely seen him:</p>
<p>His favour 1920 is familiar to me. Boy,</p>
<p>Thou hast looked thyself into my grace 1921 ,</p>
<p>And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,</p>
<p>To say ‘Live, boy.’ Ne’er thank thy master 1922 : live,</p>
<p>And ask of Cymbeline what boon 1923 thou wilt,</p>
<p>Fitting my bounty and thy state 1924 , I’ll give it,</p>
<p>Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,</p>
<p>The noblest ta’en.</p>
<p>INNOGEN I humbly thank your highness.</p>
<p>LUCIUS I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad,</p>
<p>And yet I know thou wilt.</p>
<p>INNOGEN No, no, alack,</p>
<p>There’s other work in hand: I see a thing</p>
<p>Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,</p>
<p>Must shuffle 1925 for itself.</p>
<p>LUCIUS The boy disdains me,</p>
<p>He leaves me, scorns me: briefly 1926 die their joys</p>
<p>That place them on the truth 1927 of girls and boys.</p>
<p>Why stands he so perplexed 1928 ?</p>
<p>Innogen looks closely at Iachimo</p>
<p>CYMBELINE What wouldst thou, boy?</p>
<p>I love thee more and more: think more and more</p>
<p>What’s best to ask. Know’st him thou look’st on? Speak,</p>
<p>Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? Thy friend?</p>
<p>INNOGEN He is a Roman, no more kin to me</p>
<p>Than I to your highness, who, being born your vassal 1929 ,</p>
<p>Am something nearer 1930 .</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Wherefore ey’st him so 1931 ?</p>
<p>INNOGEN I’ll tell you, sir, in private, if you please</p>
<p>To give me hearing.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Ay, with all my heart,</p>
<p>And lend my best attention. What’s thy name?</p>
<p>INNOGEN Fidele, sir.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Thou’rt my good youth, my page:</p>
<p>I’ll be thy master: walk with me, speak freely.</p>
<p>Cymbeline and Innogen converse apart</p>
<p>BELARIUS Is not this boy revived from death?</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS One sand another</p>
<p>Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad</p>
<p>Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS The same dead thing alive.</p>
<p>BELARIUS Peace, peace, see further: he eyes 1932 us not, forbear 1933
.</p>
<p>Creatures may be alike: were’t he, I am sure</p>
<p>He would have spoke to us.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS But we see him dead 1934 .</p>
<p>BELARIUS Be silent: let’s see further.</p>
<p>PISANIO It is my mistress:</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Since she is living, let the time run on</p>
<p>To good or bad.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Come, stand thou by our side,</p>
<p>Cymbeline and Innogen come forward</p>
<p>Make thy demand aloud.— Sir, step you forth,</p>
<p>To Iachimo</p>
<p>Give answer to this boy, and do it freely</p>
<p>Or by our greatness and the grace of it,</p>
<p>Which is our honour, bitter torture shall</p>
<p>Winnow 1935 the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.</p>
<p>INNOGEN My boon is that this gentleman may render 1936</p>
<p>Of whom he had this ring.</p>
<p>Points to the ring</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS What’s that to him?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CYMBELINE That diamond upon your finger, say,</p>
<p>To Iachimo</p>
<p>How came it yours?</p>
<p>IACHIMO Thou’lt torture me 1937 to leave unspoken that</p>
<p>Which to be spoke would torture thee.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE How? Me?</p>
<p>IACHIMO I am glad to be constrained to utter that</p>
<p>Which torments me to conceal. By villainy</p>
<p>I got this ring: ‘twas Leonatus’ jewel,</p>
<p>Whom thou didst banish: and — which more may grieve thee,</p>
<p>As it doth me — a nobler sir ne’er lived</p>
<p>’Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?</p>
<p>CYMBELINE All that belongs to this 1938 .</p>
<p>IACHIMO That paragon, thy daughter,</p>
<p>For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits</p>
<p>Quail to remember — give me leave, I faint.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE My daughter? What of her? Renew thy strength:</p>
<p>I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will 1939</p>
<p>Than die ere 1940 I hear more: strive, man, and speak.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Upon a time — unhappy was the clock</p>
<p>That struck the hour! — it was in Rome — accursed</p>
<p>The mansion where! — ’twas at a feast — O, would</p>
<p>Our viands 1941 had been poisoned, or at least</p>
<p>Those which I heaved to head 1942 ! — the good Posthumus —</p>
<p>What should I say? He was too good to be</p>
<p>Where ill men were, and was the best of all</p>
<p>Amongst the rar’st 1943 of good ones — sitting sadly 1944 ,</p>
<p>Hearing us praise our loves of Italy</p>
<p>For beauty that made barren 1945 the swelled boast</p>
<p>Of him that best could speak: for feature 1946 , laming 1947</p>
<p>The shrine 1948 of Venus 1949 or straight-pight 1950 Minerva 1951
,</p>
<p>Postures beyond 1952 brief nature 1953 : for condition 1954 ,</p>
<p>A shop 1955 of all the qualities that man</p>
<p>Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving 1956 ,</p>
<p>Fairness which strikes the eye—</p>
<p>CYMBELINE I stand on fire 1957 .</p>
<p>Come to the matter 1958 .</p>
<p>IACHIMO All too soon I shall,</p>
<p>Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,</p>
<p>Most like a noble lord in love and one</p>
<p>That had a royal lover, took his hint 1959 ,</p>
<p>And not dispraising whom we praised — therein</p>
<p>He was as calm as virtue — he began</p>
<p>His mistress’ picture, which by his tongue being made,</p>
<p>And then a mind put in’t 1960 , either our brags</p>
<p>Were cracked of 1961 kitchen-trulls 1962 , or his description</p>
<p>Proved us unspeaking sots 1963 .</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Nay, nay, to th’purpose 1964 .</p>
<p>IACHIMO Your daughter’s chastity — there it begins.</p>
<p>He spake of her as Dian 1965 had hot 1966 dreams</p>
<p>And she 1967 alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,</p>
<p>Made scruple 1968 of his praise, and wagered with him</p>
<p>Pieces of gold gainst this, which then he wore</p>
<p>Upon his honoured finger, to attain</p>
<p>In suit 1969 the place of’s bed and win this ring</p>
<p>By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,</p>
<p>No lesser of her honour confident</p>
<p>Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring,</p>
<p>And would so had it been a carbuncle 1970</p>
<p>Of Phoebus’ wheel 1971 , and might so 1972 safely had it</p>
<p>Been all the worth of’s car 1973 . Away to Britain</p>
<p>Post 1974 I in this design: well may you, sir,</p>
<p>Remember me at court, where I was taught</p>
<p>Of 1975 your chaste daughter the wide difference</p>
<p>’Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quenched</p>
<p>Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain</p>
<p>’Gan in your duller Britain 1976 operate</p>
<p>Most vilely: for my vantage 1977 , excellent.</p>
<p>And, to be brief, my practice so prevailed</p>
<p>That I returned with simular 1978 proof enough</p>
<p>To make the noble Leonatus mad</p>
<p>By wounding his belief in her renown 1979</p>
<p>With tokens thus, and thus 1980 : averring 1981 notes</p>
<p>Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet —</p>
<p>Shows the bracelet</p>
<p>O, cunning, how I got it! — nay, some marks</p>
<p>Of secret on her person, that he could not</p>
<p>But think her bond of chastity quite cracked 1982 ,</p>
<p>I having ta’en the forfeit 1983 . Whereupon —</p>
<p>Methinks I see him now—</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Ay, so thou dost,</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,</p>
<p>Egregious murderer, thief, anything 1984</p>
<p>That’s due to all the villains past, in being 1985 ,</p>
<p>To come! O, give me cord 1986 , or knife, or poison,</p>
<p>Some upright justicer 1987 ! Thou, king, send out</p>
<p>For torturers ingenious 1988 : it is I</p>
<p>That all th’abhorrèd 1989 things o’th’earth amend 1990</p>
<p>By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,</p>
<p>That killed thy daughter — villain-like, I lie —</p>
<p>That caused a lesser villain than myself,</p>
<p>A sacrilegious thief 1991 , to do’t. The temple</p>
<p>Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself 1992 .</p>
<p>Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set</p>
<p>The dogs o’th’street to bay 1993 me: every villain</p>
<p>Be called Posthumus Leonatus, and</p>
<p>Be villainy less than ’twas 1994 ! O Innogen!</p>
<p>My queen, my life, my wife: O Innogen,</p>
<p>Innogen, Innogen!</p>
<p>INNOGEN Peace, my lord, hear, hear.</p>
<p>She runs to him?</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Shall’s have 1995 a play of this? Thou scornful page,</p>
<p>There lie thy part 1996 .</p>
<p>He strikes her and she falls</p>
<p>PISANIO O, gentlemen, help!</p>
<p>Mine and your mistress: O, my lord Posthumus,</p>
<p>You ne’er killed Innogen till now. Help, help!</p>
<p>Mine honoured lady.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Does the world go round?</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS How comes these staggers 1997 on me?</p>
<p>PISANIO Wake, my mistress!</p>
<p>CYMBELINE If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me</p>
<p>To death with mortal 1998 joy.</p>
<p>PISANIO How fares my mistress?</p>
<p>INNOGEN O, get thee from my sight,</p>
<p>Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!</p>
<p>Breathe not where princes are.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE The tune 1999 of Innogen.</p>
<p>PISANIO Lady, the gods throw stones of sulphur 2000 on me if</p>
<p>That box I gave you was not thought by me</p>
<p>A precious thing: I had it from the queen.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE New matter still.</p>
<p>INNOGEN It poisoned me.</p>
<p>CORNELIUS O gods!</p>
<p>I left out one thing which the queen confessed,</p>
<p>Which must approve 2001 thee honest. ’If Pisanio</p>
<p>Have’, said she, ’given his mistress that confection 2002</p>
<p>Which I gave him for cordial 2003 , she is served</p>
<p>As I would serve a rat.’</p>
<p>CYMBELINE What’s this, Cornelius?</p>
<p>CORNELIUS The queen, sir, very oft importuned me</p>
<p>To temper 2004 poisons for her, still pretending 2005</p>
<p>The satisfaction of her knowledge only</p>
<p>In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,</p>
<p>Of no esteem 2006 . I, dreading that her purpose</p>
<p>Was of more danger, did compound for her</p>
<p>A certain stuff which, being ta’en, would cease 2007</p>
<p>The present power of life, but in short time</p>
<p>All offices of nature 2008 should again</p>
<p>Do their due functions. Have you ta’en of it?</p>
<p>INNOGEN Most like 2009 I did, for I was dead.</p>
<p>BELARIUS My boys,</p>
<p>There was our error.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS This is sure 2010 Fidele.</p>
<p>INNOGEN Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?</p>
<p>Think that you are upon a rock, and now</p>
<p>Throw me again.</p>
<p>Embraces him</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Hang there like fruit, my soul,</p>
<p>Till the tree 2011 die.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE How now, my flesh, my child?</p>
<p>What, mak’st thou me a dullard in this act 2012 ?</p>
<p>Wilt thou not speak to me?</p>
<p>INNOGEN Your blessing, sir.</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>BELARIUS Though you did love this youth, I blame ye not.</p>
<p>To Guiderius and Arviragus</p>
<p>You had a motive 2013 for’t.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE My tears that fall</p>
<p>Prove holy water on thee! Innogen,</p>
<p>Thy mother’s 2014 dead.</p>
<p>INNOGEN I am sorry for’t, my lord.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE O, she was naught 2015 , and long of 2016 her it was</p>
<p>That we meet here so strangely 2017 : but her son</p>
<p>Is gone, we know not how nor where.</p>
<p>PISANIO My lord,</p>
<p>Now fear is from me, I’ll speak troth. Lord Cloten,</p>
<p>Upon my lady’s missing 2018 , came to me</p>
<p>With his sword drawn, foamed at the mouth, and swore,</p>
<p>If I discovered 2019 not which way she was gone,</p>
<p>It was my instant death. By accident 2020 ,</p>
<p>I had a feignèd letter 2021 of my master’s</p>
<p>Then in my pocket, which directed him</p>
<p>To seek her on the mountains near to Milford,</p>
<p>Where in a frenzy, in my master’s garments,</p>
<p>Which he enforced 2022 from me, away he posts 2023</p>
<p>With unchaste purpose, and with oath to violate</p>
<p>My lady’s honour. What became of him</p>
<p>I further know not.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS Let me end the story:</p>
<p>I slew him there.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Marry, the gods forfend 2024 !</p>
<p>I would not thy good deeds should from my lips</p>
<p>Pluck a hard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,</p>
<p>Deny’t again 2025 .</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS I have spoke it, and I did it.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE He was a prince 2026 .</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS A most incivil 2027 one. The wrongs he did me</p>
<p>Were nothing prince-like, for he did provoke me</p>
<p>With language that would make me spurn the sea,</p>
<p>If it could so roar to me. I cut off’s head,</p>
<p>And am right glad he is not standing here</p>
<p>To tell this tale of mine 2028 .</p>
<p>CYMBELINE I am sorrow 2029 for thee:</p>
<p>By thine own tongue thou art condemned, and must</p>
<p>Endure our law: thou’rt dead 2030 .</p>
<p>INNOGEN That headless man</p>
<p>I thought had been my lord.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Bind the offender,</p>
<p>And take him from our presence.</p>
<p>BELARIUS Stay, sir king.</p>
<p>This man is better than the man he slew,</p>
<p>As well descended 2031 as thyself, and hath</p>
<p>More of 2032 thee merited 2033 than a band of Clotens</p>
<p>Had ever scar for 2034 .— Let his arms alone,</p>
<p>To the Guard</p>
<p>They were not born for bondage.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Why, old soldier,</p>
<p>Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for 2035</p>
<p>By tasting of 2036 our wrath? How of descent</p>
<p>As good as we?</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS In that he spake too far.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE And thou 2037 shalt die for’t.</p>
<p>BELARIUS We will die all three,</p>
<p>But I will 2038 prove that two on’s 2039 are as good</p>
<p>As I have given out him 2040 . My sons, I must</p>
<p>For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech 2041 ,</p>
<p>Though haply 2042 well for 2043 you.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Your danger’s ours.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS And our good his.</p>
<p>BELARIUS Have at it then, by leave 2044 .</p>
<p>Thou hadst, great king, a subject who</p>
<p>Was called Belarius.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE What of him? He is</p>
<p>A banished traitor.</p>
<p>BELARIUS He it is that hath</p>
<p>Assumed this age 2045 : indeed, a banished man,</p>
<p>I know not how a traitor.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Take him hence,</p>
<p>The whole world shall not save him.</p>
<p>BELARIUS Not too hot 2046 :</p>
<p>First pay me for the nursing of thy sons,</p>
<p>And let it 2047 be confiscate all 2048 so 2049 soon</p>
<p>As I have received it.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Nursing of my sons?</p>
<p>BELARIUS I am too blunt and saucy 2050 , here’s my knee:</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>Ere I arise I will prefer 2051 my sons,</p>
<p>Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,</p>
<p>These two young gentlemen that call me father,</p>
<p>And think they are my sons, are none of mine.</p>
<p>They are the issue of your loins, my liege,</p>
<p>And blood 2052 of your begetting.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE How, my issue?</p>
<p>BELARIUS So sure as you your father’s. I, old Morgan,</p>
<p>Am that Belarius whom you sometime 2053 banished:</p>
<p>Your pleasure was my mere 2054 offence, my punishment</p>
<p>Itself, and all my treason. That I suffered</p>
<p>Was all the harm I did 2055 . These gentle princes —</p>
<p>For such and so they are — these twenty years</p>
<p>Have I trained up: those arts they have as I</p>
<p>Could put into 2056 them. My breeding was, sir,</p>
<p>As your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,</p>
<p>Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children</p>
<p>Upon my banishment: I moved 2057 her to’t,</p>
<p>Having received the punishment before</p>
<p>For that which I did then 2058 . Beaten 2059 for loyalty</p>
<p>Excited 2060 me to treason. Their dear loss,</p>
<p>The more of 2061 you ’twas felt, the more it shaped</p>
<p>Unto 2062 my end of 2063 stealing them. But, gracious sir,</p>
<p>Here are your sons again, and I must lose</p>
<p>Two of the sweet’st companions in the world.</p>
<p>The benediction of these covering heavens</p>
<p>Fall on their heads like dew, for they are worthy</p>
<p>To inlay heaven with stars.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Thou weep’st, and speak’st:</p>
<p>The service 2064 that you three have done is more</p>
<p>Unlike 2065 than this thou tell’st. I lost my children:</p>
<p>If these be they, I know not how to wish</p>
<p>A pair of worthier sons.</p>
<p>BELARIUS Be pleased awhile 2066 .</p>
<p>This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,</p>
<p>Most worthy prince, as yours 2067 , is true Guiderius:</p>
<p>This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,</p>
<p>Your younger princely son. He, sir, was lapped 2068</p>
<p>In a most curious 2069 mantle, wrought by th’hand</p>
<p>Of his queen mother, which for more probation 2070</p>
<p>I can with ease produce.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Guiderius had</p>
<p>Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine 2071 star.</p>
<p>It was a mark of wonder.</p>
<p>BELARIUS This is he,</p>
<p>Who hath upon him still that natural stamp 2072 :</p>
<p>It was wise nature’s end in the donation 2073</p>
<p>To be his evidence now.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE O, what am I?</p>
<p>A mother to the birth of three? Ne’er mother</p>
<p>Rejoiced deliverance 2074 more: blest pray 2075 you be,</p>
<p>That, after this strange starting from your orbs 2076 ,</p>
<p>You may reign in them now! O Innogen,</p>
<p>Thou hast lost by this a kingdom 2077 .</p>
<p>INNOGEN No, my lord:</p>
<p>I have got two worlds by’t. O my gentle brothers,</p>
<p>Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter</p>
<p>But 2078 I am truest speaker. You called me brother</p>
<p>When I was but your sister: I you brothers,</p>
<p>When ye were so indeed.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Did you e’er meet?</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p>GUIDERIUS And at first meeting loved,</p>
<p>Continued so until we thought he died.</p>
<p>CORNELIUS By the queen’s dram she swallowed.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE O rare 2079 instinct!</p>
<p>When shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgement 2080</p>
<p>Hath to it circumstantial branches 2081 , which</p>
<p>Distinction should be rich in 2082 . Where? How lived you?</p>
<p>And when came you to serve our Roman captive?</p>
<p>How parted with your brothers? How first met them?</p>
<p>Why fled you from the court? And whither? These,</p>
<p>And your three motives to 2083 the battle, with</p>
<p>I know not how much more, should be demanded 2084 ,</p>
<p>And all the other by-dependences 2085 ,</p>
<p>From chance 2086 to chance. But nor 2087 the time nor place</p>
<p>Will serve 2088 our long interrogatories 2089 . See,</p>
<p>Posthumus anchors 2090 upon Innogen,</p>
<p>And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye 2091</p>
<p>On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting</p>
<p>Each object with a joy: the counterchange</p>
<p>Is severally in all 2092 . Let’s quit this ground 2093 ,</p>
<p>And smoke 2094 the temple with our sacrifices.—</p>
<p>Thou art my brother, so we’ll hold 2095 thee ever.</p>
<p>To Belarius</p>
<p>INNOGEN You are my father too, and did relieve me 2096</p>
<p>To see this gracious season 2097 .</p>
<p>CYMBELINE All o’erjoyed,</p>
<p>Save 2098 these in bonds: let them be joyful too,</p>
<p>For they shall taste our comfort 2099 .</p>
<p>INNOGEN My good master,</p>
<p>I will yet do you service.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Happy be you!</p>
<p>CYMBELINE The forlorn 2100 soldier, that so nobly fought,</p>
<p>He would have well becomed 2101 this place, and graced 2102</p>
<p>The thankings of a king.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS I am, sir,</p>
<p>The soldier that did company 2103 these three</p>
<p>In poor beseeming 2104 : ’twas a fitment 2105 for</p>
<p>The purpose I then followed. That I was he,</p>
<p>Speak, Iachimo: I had you down, and might</p>
<p>Have made you finish 2106 .</p>
<p>IACHIMO I am down again:</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>But now my heavy conscience sinks 2107 my knee,</p>
<p>As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,</p>
<p>Which I so often 2108 owe: but your ring first,</p>
<p>And here the bracelet of the truest princess</p>
<p>That ever swore her faith.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Kneel not to me:</p>
<p>The power that I have on you is to spare you:</p>
<p>The malice towards you to forgive you. Live,</p>
<p>And deal with others better.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Nobly doomed 2109 !</p>
<p>We’ll learn our freeness 2110 of a son-in-law:</p>
<p>Pardon’s the word to all.</p>
<p>ARVIRAGUS You holp 2111 us, sir,</p>
<p>As 2112 you did mean indeed to be our brother.</p>
<p>Joyed 2113 are we that you are.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,</p>
<p>Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought</p>
<p>Great Jupiter, upon his eagle backed 2114 ,</p>
<p>Appeared to me, with other spritely shows 2115</p>
<p>Of mine own kindred. When I waked I found</p>
<p>This label 2116 on my bosom, whose containing 2117</p>
<p>Is so from sense in hardness 2118 that I can</p>
<p>Make no collection of 2119 it. Let him show</p>
<p>His skill in the construction 2120 .</p>
<p>LUCIUS Philharmonus 2121 .</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER Here, my good lord.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Read, and declare the meaning.</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER Reads ’Whenas a lion’s whelp 2122 shall, to himself
unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of tender air:
and when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches, which being dead
many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly
grow, then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate and
flourish in peace and plenty.’Thou, Leonatus, art the lion’s whelp:</p>
<p>The fit and apt construction of thy name,</p>
<p>Being leo-natus 2123 , doth import 2124 so much.—</p>
<p>The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,</p>
<p>To Cymbeline</p>
<p>Which we call ‘mollis aer 2125’; and ‘mollis aer’</p>
<p>We term it ‘mulier’.— Which ‘mulier’ I divine 2126</p>
<p>Is this most constant wife, who even now,</p>
<p>Answering the letter of the oracle,</p>
<p>Unknown to you, unsought, were clipped about 2127</p>
<p>With this most tender air.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE This hath some seeming 2128 .</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER The lofty cedar 2129 , royal Cymbeline,</p>
<p>Personates 2130 thee: and thy lopped branches point</p>
<p>Thy two sons forth 2131 , who by Belarius stol’n,</p>
<p>For many years thought dead, are now revived,</p>
<p>To the majestic cedar joined, whose issue 2132</p>
<p>Promises Britain peace and plenty.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Well,</p>
<p>My peace we will begin.— And, Caius Lucius,</p>
<p>Although the victor, we submit to Caesar</p>
<p>And to the Roman empire, promising</p>
<p>To pay our wonted 2133 tribute, from the which</p>
<p>We were dissuaded by our wicked queen,</p>
<p>Whom 2134 heavens in justice both on her and hers</p>
<p>Have laid most heavy hand.</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER The fingers of the powers above do tune</p>
<p>The harmony of this peace. The vision</p>
<p>Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke 2135</p>
<p>Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant</p>
<p>Is full accomplished. For the Roman eagle,</p>
<p>From south to west on wing soaring aloft,</p>
<p>Lessened herself 2136 , and in the beams o’th’sun</p>
<p>So vanished; which foreshowed our princely eagle,</p>
<p>Th’imperial Caesar, should again unite</p>
<p>His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,</p>
<p>Which shines here in the west 2137 .</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Laud 2138 we the gods,</p>
<p>And let our crookèd 2139 smokes climb to their nostrils</p>
<p>From our blest altars. Publish 2140 we this peace</p>
<p>To all our subjects. Set we forward 2141 : let</p>
<p>A Roman and a British ensign 2142 wave</p>
<p>Friendly together: so through Lud’s town march,</p>
<p>And in the temple of great Jupiter</p>
<p>Our peace we’ll ratify, seal 2143 it with feasts.</p>
<p>Set on there 2144 ! Never was a war did cease,</p>
<p>Ere bloody hands were washed, with such a peace.</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster , and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues. There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in making
such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the pace of
the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of Othello
).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding(thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants]’ ). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading’bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
<p>Innogen’s bedtime reading (‘She hath been reading late, / The tale of
Tereus. Here the leaf’s turned down / Where Philomel gave up’) was also
one of Shakespeare’s favourite books: Ovid’s Metamorphoses was the main
source for his knowledge of classical mythology and the direct
inspiration for Venus and Adonis, Titus Andronicus, ‘Pyramus and Thisbe’
in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, as well as key aspects of the Sonnets, The
Winter’s Tale and The Tempest. Arthur Golding’s 1567 translation, which
Shakespeare knew well, was dedicated to the Earl of Leicester, so its
title page included his insignia of a chained bear and the motto of the
Order of the Garter.
伊诺贞的睡前读物（“她看书到深夜，/看的是忒柔斯的故事。折页处/正在菲洛梅尔屈服受辱的关口”）也是莎士比亚最喜爱的著作之一：奥维德的《变形记》是他古典神话知识的主要来源，还直接激发他创作了长诗《维纳斯与阿多尼斯》、剧作《泰特斯·安德洛尼克斯》、《仲夏夜之梦》中的剧中剧《皮剌摩斯与提斯柏》；此外，十四行诗、《冬天的故事》与《暴风雨》中也多有内容受其影响。莎士比亚很熟悉的阿瑟·戈尔丁1567年译本，是献给莱斯伯爵的，因此其标题页上出现了伯爵的家庭徽章图案——上锁链的熊，以及嘉德勋章的格言。</p>
<p>“This new Complete Works from the RSC is a glorious edition of one of
the world’s most important books. It’s the essential reference book for
anyone who’s ever been in love, felt jealousy, fear, hatred, or desire.
All human life is here - and every home should have one.“</p>
<p>——Dame Judi Dench</p>
<p>“莎士比亚作品是全世界最重要的著作之一，皇家莎士比亚剧团推出的新版《莎士比亚全集》为其再添一笔华彩。但凡恋爱过、嫉妒过、恐惧过、厌憎过、渴望过的人，皆可从中找到共鸣；人生百态，世间风韵，都能在这里寻到踪影——它的确值得每个家庭拥有。”</p>
<p>——朱迪·丹奇女爵士</p>
<p>“Thanks to Bate and Rasmussen, we now have a rendering of the
Complete Works that, in a rare publishing achievement, would also give
complete satisfaction to the author himself.“</p>
<p>——Robert McCrum, The Observer</p>
<p>“感谢贝特和拉斯姆森两位编者为我们奉上这版《莎士比亚全集》，它的成就堪称出版界罕有，即便莎翁本人也无可挑剔。”</p>
