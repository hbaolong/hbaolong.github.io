16</h4>
<p>Enter the three bawds 912 : [Pander 913 , Bawd and Bolt 914 ]</p>
<p>PANDER Bolt.</p>
<p>BOLT Sir.</p>
<p>PANDER Search the market narrowly 915 . Mytilene 916 is full of
gallants 917 , we lost too much money this mart 918 by being too
wenchless.</p>
<p>BAWD We were never so much out of creatures 919 . We have but poor
three 920 , and they can do no more than they can do, and they with
continual action 921 are even as good as rotten 922 .</p>
<p>PANDER Therefore let’s have fresh 923 ones, whate’er we pay for them.
If there be not a conscience to be used in every trade 924 , we shall
never prosper.</p>
<p>BAWD Thou say’st true. ’Tis not our bringing up of poor bastards 925
— as I think, I have brought up some eleven—</p>
<p>BOLT Ay, to eleven, and brought them down again 926 . But shall I
search the market?</p>
<p>BAWD What else, man? The stuff 927 we have, a strong wind will blow
it to pieces 928 , they are so pitifully sodden 929 .</p>
<p>PANDER Thou say’st true, they’re too unwholesome 930 , o’conscience
931 : the poor Transylvanian is dead that lay with the little baggage
932 .</p>
<p>BOLT Ay, she quickly pooped 933 him, she made him roast meat 934 for
worms 935 . But I’ll go search the market.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>PANDER Three or four thousand chequins 936 were as pretty a
proportion 937 to live quietly, and so give over 938 .</p>
<p>BAWD Why to give over, I pray you? Is it a shame to get 939 when we
are old?</p>
<p>PANDER O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor the
commodity wages not with the danger 940 . Therefore, if in our youths we
could pick up some pretty estate, ’twere not amiss to keep our door
hatched 941 . Besides, the sore 942 terms we stand upon with the gods
will be strong with us for giving o’er 943 .</p>
<p>BAWD Come, other sorts 944 offend as well as we 945 .</p>
<p>PANDER As well as we, ay, and better too. We offend worse: neither is
our profession 946 any trade, it’s no calling 947 . But here comes
Bolt.</p>
<p>Enter Bolt with the Pirates and Marina</p>
<p>BOLT Come your ways 948 , my masters. You say she’s a virgin?</p>
<p>FIRST PIRATE O, sir, we doubt it not.</p>
<p>BOLT Master, I have gone through 949 for this piece 950 you see. If
you like her, so 951 . If not, I have lost my earnest 952 .</p>
<p>BAWD Bolt, has she any qualities 953 ?</p>
<p>BOLT She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent good
clothes: there’s no further necessity of qualities can make her be
refused 954 .</p>
<p>BAWD What’s her price, Bolt?</p>
<p>BOLT I cannot be bated 955 one doit 956 of a thousand pieces 957
.</p>
<p>PANDER Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your money
presently 958 . Wife, take her in, instruct her what she has to do, that
she may not be raw 959 in her entertainment 960 .</p>
<p>[Exeunt Pander and the Pirates ]</p>
<p>BAWD Bolt, take you the marks 961 of her — the colour of her hair,
complexion, height, her age — with warrant 962 of her virginity, and
cry: ‘He that will give most shall have her first.’ Such a maidenhead
were no cheap thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done as I
command you.</p>
<p>BOLT Performance shall follow 963 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>MARINA Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow:</p>
<p>He should have struck, not spoke. Or that these pirates,</p>
<p>Not enough barbarous, had but o’erboard thrown me,</p>
<p>For to seek my mother.</p>
<p>BAWD Why lament you, pretty one?</p>
<p>MARINA That I am pretty.</p>
<p>BAWD Come, the gods have done their part 964 in you.</p>
<p>MARINA I accuse them not.</p>
<p>BAWD You are light 965 into my hands, where you are like 966 to
live.</p>
<p>MARINA The more my fault 967 ,</p>
<p>To scape his hands, where I was like to die.</p>
<p>BAWD Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.</p>
<p>MARINA No.</p>
<p>BAWD Yes indeed shall you, and taste 968 gentlemen of all fashions
969 . You shall fare well, you shall have the difference 970 of all
complexions 971 . What, do you stop your ears?</p>
<p>MARINA Are you a woman?</p>
<p>BAWD What would you have me be, an 972 I be not a woman?</p>
<p>MARINA An honest 973 woman, or not a woman.</p>
<p>BAWD Marry 974 , whip the gosling 975 ! I think I shall have
something to do with you 976 . Come, you’re a young foolish sapling 977
and must be bowed 978 as I would have you.</p>
<p>MARINA The gods defend me!</p>
<p>BAWD If it please the gods to defend you by 979 men, then men must
comfort 980 you, men must feed 981 you, men stir you up 982 .</p>
<p>[Enter Bolt ]</p>
<p>Bolt’s returned. Now, sir, hast thou cried her 983 through the
market?</p>
<p>BOLT I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs 984 , I have
drawn her picture with my voice.</p>
<p>BAWD And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the inclination of the
people, especially of the younger sort?</p>
<p>BOLT Faith, they listened to me as they would have hearkened to their
fathers’ testament 985 . There was a Spaniard 986 ’s mouth watered, and
he went to 987 bed to her very description.</p>
<p>BAWD We shall have him here tomorrow with his best ruff 988 on.</p>
<p>BOLT Tonight, tonight! 989 But mistress, do you know the French 990
knight, that cowers i’th’hams 991 ?</p>
<p>BAWD Who, Monsieur Veroles 992 ?</p>
<p>BOLT Ay, he. He offered to 993 cut a caper 994 at the proclamation,
but he made a groan at it 995 , and swore he would see her tomorrow.</p>
<p>BAWD Well, well. As for him, he brought his disease hither 996 , here
he does but repair 997 it. I know he will come in our shadow 998 to
scatter his crowns in the sun 999 .</p>
<p>BOLT Well, if we had of every nation a traveller 1000 , we should
lodge 1001 them with this sign 1002 .</p>
<p>BAWD Pray you, come hither awhile. You have fortunes coming upon you
1003 . Mark me, you must seem to do that fearfully which you commit
willingly, despise 1004 profit where you have most gain. To weep that
you live as ye do makes 1005 pity in your lovers. Seldom but that pity
begets you a good opinion, and that opinion a mere 1006 profit.</p>
<p>To Marina</p>
<p>MARINA I understand you not.</p>
<p>BOLT O, take her home 1007 , mistress, take her home!</p>
<p>These blushes of hers must be quenched with some present 1008
practice 1009 .</p>
<p>BAWD Thou say’st true, i’faith, so they must, for your bride goes to
that with shame 1010 which is her way to go with warrant 1011 .</p>
<p>BOLT Faith, some do, and some do not 1012 . But mistress, if I have
bargained for the joint—</p>
<p>BAWD Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit 1013 .</p>
<p>BOLT I may so.</p>
<p>BAWD Who should deny it?—Come, young one, I like the manner 1014 of
your garments well.</p>
<p>To Marina</p>
<p>BOLT Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.</p>
<p>BAWD Bolt, spend thou that in the town. Report what a sojourner 1015
we have, you’ll lose nothing by custom 1016 . When Nature framed this
piece 1017 1018 , she meant thee a good turn 1019 , therefore say what a
paragon 1020 she is, and thou hast the harvest out of thine own
report.</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>BOLT I warrant 1021 you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake the
beds of eels as my giving out 1022 her beauty stirs up 1023 the lewdly
inclined 1024 1025 . I’ll bring home some tonight.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>BAWD Come your ways 1026 , follow me.</p>
<p>To Marina</p>
<p>MARINA If fires be hot, knives sharp or waters deep,</p>
<p>Untried I still my virgin knot will keep 1027 .</p>
<p>Diana, aid my purpose 1028 !</p>
<p>BAWD What have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with
us?</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
