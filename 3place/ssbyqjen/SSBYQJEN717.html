<h4 id="scene-1-414-running-scene-4">Scene 1 414 ／ running scene 4</h4>
<p>Enter Hostess [Quickly ], with two officers: Fang and Snare</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Master 415 Fang, have you entered the action 416
?</p>
<p>FANG It is entered.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Where’s your yeoman 417 ? Is it a lusty 418 yeoman?
Will he stand to it 419 ?</p>
<p>FANG Sirrah— Where’s Snare?</p>
<p>Looks around</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Ay, ay, good Master Snare.</p>
<p>SNARE Here, here.</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>FANG Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Ay, good Master Snare, I have entered 420 him and
all.</p>
<p>SNARE It may chance cost some of us our lives: he will stab.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Alas the day. Take heed of him: he stabbed 421 me in
mine own house 422 , and that most beastly. He cares not what mischief
he doth, if his weapon 423 be out. He will foin 424 like any devil, he
will spare neither man, woman nor child.</p>
<p>FANG If I can close 425 with him, I care not for his thrust.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY No, nor I neither: I’ll be at your elbow.</p>
<p>FANG If I but fist 426 him once, if he come 427 but within my vice
428 —</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY I am undone 429 with his going 430 . I warrant 431 he
is an infinitive 432 thing 433 upon my score 434 . Good Master Fang,
hold him sure 435 : good Master Snare, let him not scape 436 . He comes
continuantly 437 to Pie-corner 438 — saving your manhoods 439 — to buy a
saddle 440 , and he is indited 441 442 to dinner to the Lubber’s-head in
Lombard Street 443 , to Master Smooth’s the silkman. I pra’ye, since my
exion 444 is entered and my case 445 so openly known to the world, let
him be brought in to his answer. A hundred mark 446 is a long one 447
for a poor lone woman to bear, and I have borne, and borne, and borne,
and have been fubbed 448 off, and fubbed off, from this day to that day,
that it is a shame to be thought on. There is no honesty in such dealing
449 , unless a woman should be made an ass and a beast, to bear every
knave’s wrong 450 .</p>
<p>Enter Falstaff with his Page] and Bardolph</p>
<p>Yonder he comes, and that arrant 451 malmsey-nose 452 Bardolph, with
him. Do your offices 453 , do your offices: Master Fang and Master
Snare, do me 454 , do me, do me your offices.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF How now? Whose mare 455 ’s dead? 456 What’s the matter?</p>
<p>FANG Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Away, varlets 457 ! Draw, Bardolph. Cut me off the villain’s
head. Throw the quean 458 in the channel 459 .</p>
<p>They draw</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Throw me in the channel? I’ll throw thee there. Wilt
thou? Wilt thou? Thou bastardly rogue! Murder, murder! O, thou
honeysuckle 460 villain, wilt thou kill God’s officers and the king’s?
O, thou honey-seed 461 rogue, thou art a honey-seed, a man-queller 462 ,
and a woman-queller 463 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Keep them off, Bardolph.</p>
<p>FANG A rescue 464 , a rescue!</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Good people, bring a rescue.— Thou wilt not? Thou
wilt not? Do, do, thou rogue! Do, thou hemp-seed 465 !</p>
<p>To Page</p>
<p>PAGE Away, you scullion 466 , you rampallion 467 , you fustilarian
468 ! I’ll tuck 469 your catastrophe 470 .</p>
<p>To Fang</p>
<p>Enter Chief Justice</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE What’s the matter? Keep the peace here, ho!</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Good my 471 lord, be good to me. I beseech you stand
to 472 me.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE How now, Sir John? What are you brawling here?
Doth this become 473 your place, your time and business? You should have
been well on your way to York. Stand from him, fellow; wherefore 474
hang’st upon him?</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY O my most worshipful lord, an’t please your grace, I
am a poor widow of Eastcheap 475 , and he is arrested at my suit.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE For what sum?</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY It is more than for some, my lord, it is for all, all
I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home; he hath put all my
substance into that fat belly of his. But I will have some of it out
again, or I will ride thee o’nights like the mare 476 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I think I am as like to ride the mare 477 , if I have any
vantage of ground 478 to get up 479 .</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE How comes this, Sir John? Fie, what a man of good
temper 480 would endure this tempest of exclamation? Are you not ashamed
to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to come by her own 481
?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What is the gross 482 sum that I owe thee?</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Marry 483 , if thou wert an honest man, thyself and
the money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt 484 goblet,
sitting in my Dolphin-chamber 485 at the round table, by a sea-coal 486
fire, on Wednesday in Whitsun week 487 , when the prince broke 488 thy
head for lik’ning him to a singing-man of Windsor 489 ; thou didst swear
to me then, as I was washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady
thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife 490 Keech 491 , the
butcher’s wife, come in then and call me gossip 492 Quickly, coming in
to borrow a mess 493 of vinegar, telling us she had a good dish 494 of
prawns, whereby 495 thou didst desire to eat some, whereby I told thee
they were ill for a green 496 wound? And didst not thou, when she was
gone downstairs, desire me to be no more familiar with such poor people,
saying that ere long they should call me madam 497 ? And didst thou not
kiss me and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy
book-oath 498 : deny it, if thou canst.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My lord, this is a poor mad soul, and she says up and down
the town that her eldest son is like you 499 . She hath been in good
case 500 , and the truth is, poverty hath distracted her 501 . But for
these foolish officers, I beseech you I may have redress against
them.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your
manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It is not a confident
brow, nor the throng of words that come with such more than impudent
sauciness from you, can thrust me from a level 502 consideration. I know
you ha’ practised upon 503 the easy-yielding 504 spirit of this
woman.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Yea, in troth 505 , my lord.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Prithee, peace.— Pay her the debt 506 you owe her,
and unpay 507 the villainy you have done her: the one you may do with
sterling money, and the other with current 508 repentance.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My lord, I will not undergo this sneap 509 without reply.
You call honourable boldness ‘impudent sauciness’. If a man will curtsy
510 and say nothing, he is virtuous. No, my lord — your humble duty
remembered 511 — I will not be your suitor 512 . I say to you, I desire
deliverance from these officers, being upon hasty employment in the
king’s affairs.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE You speak as having power 513 to do wrong. But
answer in the effect of your reputation 514 , and satisfy 515 the poor
woman.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Come hither, hostess.</p>
<p>Takes Quickly aside</p>
<p>Enter Master Gower</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Now, Master Gower, what news?</p>
<p>GOWER The king, my lord, and Henry Prince of Wales</p>
<p>Are near at hand: the rest the paper tells.</p>
<p>Gives a paper</p>
<p>FALSTAFF As I am a gentleman.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Nay, you said so before.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF As I am a gentleman. Come, no more words of it.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY By this heavenly ground 516 I tread on, I must be
fain 517 to pawn both my plate 518 and the tapestry of my dining
chambers.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Glasses, glasses is the only drinking 519 . And for thy
walls, a pretty slight drollery 520 , or the story of the Prodigal 521 ,
or the German hunting 522 in water-work 523 is worth a thousand of these
bed-hangings and these fly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten pound, if
thou canst. Come, if it were not for thy humours 524 , there is not a
better wench in England. Go, wash thy face, and draw thy action 525 .
Come, thou must not be in this humour with me. Come, I know thou wast
set on 526 to this.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Prithee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles 527 .
I 528 loath to pawn my plate, in good earnest, la 529 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Let it alone. I’ll make other shift 530 . You’ll be a fool
still 531 .</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Well, you shall have it, although I pawn my gown. I
hope you’ll come to supper. You’ll pay me all together?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Will I live? 532 — Go, with her, with her — hook on, hook on
533 .</p>
<p>To Bardolph</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Will you have Doll 534 Tearsheet 535 meet you at
supper?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF No more words. Let’s have 536 her.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Quickly, Bardolph, Fang and others ]</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE I have heard bitter news.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What’s the news, my good lord?</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Where lay the king last night?</p>
<p>GOWER At Basingstoke 537 , my lord.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I hope, my lord, all’s well. What is the news, my lord?</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Come all his forces back?</p>
<p>GOWER No. Fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,</p>
<p>Are marched up to my lord of Lancaster,</p>
<p>Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Comes the king back from Wales, my noble lord?</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE You shall have letters of me presently 538 . Come,
go along with me, good Master Gower.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My lord!</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE What’s the matter?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner?</p>
<p>GOWER I must wait upon my good lord here. I thank you, good Sir
John.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Sir John, you loiter here too long, being 539 you
are to take soldiers up 540 in counties as you go.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Will you sup with me, Master Gower?</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir
John?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fool that
taught them me. This is the right fencing grace 541 , my lord: tap for
tap 542 , and so part fair 543 .</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Now the lord lighten thee 544 ! Thou art a great
545 fool.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
