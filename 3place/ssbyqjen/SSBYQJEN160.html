<h4 id="scene-1running-scene-7">Scene 1／running scene 7</h4>
<p>Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Egeus, and his lords</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA ’Tis strange, my Theseus, that 860 these lovers speak
of.</p>
<p>THESEUS More strange than true. I never may believe</p>
<p>These antic 861 fables, nor these fairy toys 862 .</p>
<p>Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,</p>
<p>Such shaping 863 fantasies that apprehend 864</p>
<p>More than cool reason ever comprehends.</p>
<p>The lunatic, the lover and the poet</p>
<p>Are of imagination all compact 865 .</p>
<p>One sees more devils than vast hell can hold;</p>
<p>That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic 866 ,</p>
<p>Sees Helen’s 867 beauty in a brow of Egypt 868 .</p>
<p>The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,</p>
<p>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven,</p>
<p>And as imagination bodies forth 869</p>
<p>The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen</p>
<p>Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing</p>
<p>A local habitation and a name.</p>
<p>Such tricks hath strong imagination,</p>
<p>That if it would but apprehend 870 some joy,</p>
<p>It comprehends 871 some bringer of that joy.</p>
<p>Or in the night, imagining some fear,</p>
<p>How easy is a bush supposed a bear!</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA But all the story of the night told over,</p>
<p>And all their minds transfigured 872 so together,</p>
<p>More witnesseth 873 than fancy’s images</p>
<p>And grows to something of great constancy 874 ;</p>
<p>But howsoever, strange and admirable 875 .</p>
<p>Enter lovers: Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, Helena</p>
<p>THESEUS Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.</p>
<p>Joy, gentle friends! Joy and fresh days of love</p>
<p>Accompany your hearts!</p>
<p>LYSANDER More than to us</p>
<p>Wait in your royal walks, your board 876 , your bed!</p>
<p>THESEUS Come now, what masques 877 , what dances shall we have,</p>
<p>To wear away this long age of three hours</p>
<p>Between our after-supper 878 and bedtime?</p>
<p>Where is our usual manager of mirth?</p>
<p>What revels are in hand? Is there no play</p>
<p>To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?</p>
<p>Call Egeus.</p>
<p>EGEUS Here, mighty Theseus.</p>
<p>THESEUS Say, what abridgement 879 have you for this evening?</p>
<p>What masque? What music? How shall we beguile</p>
<p>The lazy time, if not with some delight?</p>
<p>EGEUS There is a brief 880 how many sports are ripe 881 :</p>
<p>Make choice of which your highness will see first.</p>
<p>Egeus gives a paper to Lysander</p>
<p>LYSANDER ’The battle with the Centaurs 882 , to be sung</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.’</p>
<p>THESEUS We’ll none of that. That have I told my love,</p>
<p>In glory of my kinsman Hercules.</p>
<p>LYSANDER ’The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage 883 .’</p>
<p>THESEUS That is an old device 884 , and it was played</p>
<p>When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.</p>
<p>LYSANDER ’The thrice three Muses mourning for the death</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>Of learning, late deceased in beggary 885 .’</p>
<p>THESEUS That is some satire, keen and critical 886 ,</p>
<p>Not sorting with 887 a nuptial ceremony.</p>
<p>LYSANDER ’A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.’</p>
<p>THESEUS Merry and tragical? Tedious and brief?</p>
<p>That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow 888 .</p>
<p>How shall we find the concord 889 of this discord?</p>
<p>EGEUS A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,</p>
<p>Which is as brief as I have known a play;</p>
<p>But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,</p>
<p>Which makes it tedious. For in all the play</p>
<p>There is not one word apt, one player fitted 890 .</p>
<p>And tragical, my noble lord, it is,</p>
<p>For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.</p>
<p>Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,</p>
<p>Made mine eyes water, but more merry tears</p>
<p>The passion of loud laughter never shed.</p>
<p>THESEUS What are they that do play it?</p>
<p>EGEUS Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,</p>
<p>Which never laboured in their minds till now;</p>
<p>And now have toiled 891 their unbreathed 892 memories</p>
<p>With this same play, against 893 your nuptial.</p>
<p>THESEUS And we will hear it.</p>
<p>EGEUS No, my noble lord,</p>
<p>It is not for you. I have heard it over,</p>
<p>And it is nothing, nothing in the world;</p>
<p>Unless you can find sport in their intents,</p>
<p>Extremely stretched and conned 894 with cruel pain,</p>
<p>To do you service.</p>
<p>THESEUS I will hear that play.</p>
<p>For never anything can be amiss,</p>
<p>When simpleness 895 and duty tender it.</p>
<p>Go, bring them in.— And take your places, ladies.</p>
<p>[Exit Egeus ]</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA I love not to see wretchedness o’er-charged 896</p>
<p>And duty in his service 897 perishing.</p>
<p>THESEUS Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA He says they can do nothing in this kind 898 .</p>
<p>THESEUS The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.</p>
<p>Our sport shall be to take 899 what they mistake;</p>
<p>And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect 900</p>
<p>Takes it in might, not merit 901 .</p>
<p>Where I have come, great clerks 902 have purposèd</p>
<p>To greet me with premeditated welcomes;</p>
<p>Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,</p>
<p>Make periods 903 in the midst of sentences,</p>
<p>Throttle their practised accent 904 in their fears,</p>
<p>And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,</p>
<p>Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,</p>
<p>Out of this silence yet I picked 905 a welcome.</p>
<p>And in the modesty 906 of fearful 907 duty</p>
<p>I read as much as from the rattling tongue</p>
<p>Of saucy and audacious eloquence.</p>
<p>Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity</p>
<p>In least speak most, to my capacity 908 .</p>
<p>[Enter Egeus ]</p>
<p>EGEUS So please your grace, the Prologue is addressed 909 .</p>
<p>THESEUS Let him approach.</p>
<p>Flourish [of ] trumpets</p>
<p>Enter the Prologue: Quince</p>
<p>PROLOGUE [QUINCE] If we offend, it is with our good will. 910</p>
<p>That you should think, we come not to offend,</p>
<p>But with good will. 911 To show our simple skill,</p>
<p>That is the true beginning of our end 912 .</p>
<p>Consider then, we come but in despite 913 .</p>
<p>We do not come as minding to content you 914 ,</p>
<p>Our true intent is. 915 All 916 for your delight 917</p>
<p>We are not here. 918 That you should here repent you,</p>
<p>The actors are at hand; and by their show 919 ,</p>
<p>You shall know all that you are like 920 to know.</p>
<p>THESEUS This fellow doth not stand upon points 921 .</p>
<p>LYSANDER He hath rid 922 his prologue like a rough 923 colt: he knows
not the stop 924 . A good moral, my lord. It is not enough to speak, but
to speak true.</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a
recorder: a sound, but not in government 925 .</p>
<p>THESEUS His speech was like a tangled chain: nothing 926 impaired,
but all disordered. Who is next?</p>
<p>Enter, with a trumpet [er ] before them, Pyramus [Bottom ] and Thisbe
[Flute ], Wall [Snout ], Moonshine [Starveling ] and Lion [Snug ]</p>
<p>PROLOGUE [QUINCE] Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show,</p>
<p>But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.</p>
<p>This man is Pyramus, if you would know;</p>
<p>This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain.</p>
<p>This man with lime and rough-cast doth present</p>
<p>Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder 927 .</p>
<p>And through Wall’s chink, poor souls, they are content</p>
<p>To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.</p>
<p>This man, with lantern, dog, and bush of thorn,</p>
<p>Presenteth Moonshine. For, if you will know,</p>
<p>By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn 928</p>
<p>To meet at Ninus’ tomb, there, there to woo.</p>
<p>This grisly beast, which Lion hight 929 by name,</p>
<p>The trusty Thisbe, coming first by night,</p>
<p>Did scare away, or rather did affright.</p>
<p>And as she fled, her mantle 930 she did fall 931 ,</p>
<p>Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.</p>
<p>Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall 932 ,</p>
<p>And finds his trusty Thisbe’s mantle slain;</p>
<p>Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,</p>
<p>He bravely broached 933 his boiling bloody breast.</p>
<p>And Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,</p>
<p>His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,</p>
<p>Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain 934</p>
<p>At large discourse, while here they do remain.</p>
<p>Exeunt all but Wall</p>
<p>THESEUS I wonder if the lion be to speak.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.</p>
<p>WALL [SNOUT] In this same interlude 935 it doth befall</p>
<p>That I, one Snout by name, present a wall.</p>
<p>And such a wall, as I would have you think,</p>
<p>That had in it a crannied hole or chink,</p>
<p>Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,</p>
<p>Did whisper often, very secretly.</p>
<p>This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show</p>
<p>That I am that same wall; the truth is so.</p>
<p>And this the cranny is, right and sinister 936 ,</p>
<p>Gestures to gap between his legs</p>
<p>Through which the fearful 937 lovers are to whisper.</p>
<p>THESEUS Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS It is the wittiest partition 938 that ever I heard
discourse, my lord.</p>
<p>THESEUS Pyramus draws near the wall. Silence!</p>
<p>Enter Pyramus</p>
<p>PYRAMUS [BOTTOM] O grim-looked 939 night! O night with hue so
black!</p>
<p>O night, which ever art when day is not!</p>
<p>O night, O night! Alack, alack, alack,</p>
<p>I fear my Thisbe’s promise is forgot.</p>
<p>And thou, O wall, thou sweet and lovely wall</p>
<p>That stands between her father’s ground and mine!</p>
<p>Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,</p>
<p>Show me thy chink 940 , to blink through with mine eyne!</p>
<p>Wall opens his legs</p>
<p>Thanks, courteous wall. Jove 941 shield thee well for this.</p>
<p>Pyramus peers between Wall’s legs</p>
<p>But what see I? No Thisbe do I see.</p>
<p>O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!</p>
<p>Cursed be thy stones 942 for thus deceiving me!</p>
<p>THESEUS The wall, methinks, being sensible 943 , should curse again
944 .</p>
<p>PYRAMUS [BOTTOM] No, in truth, sir, he should not. ‘Deceiving me’ is
Thisbe’s cue; she is to enter and I am to spy her through the wall. You
shall see, it will fall pat 945 as I told you. Yonder she comes.</p>
<p>Enter Thisbe</p>
<p>THISBE [FLUTE] O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,</p>
<p>For parting my fair Pyramus and me.</p>
<p>My cherry lips have often kissed thy stones,</p>
<p>Thy stones with lime 946 and hair 947 knit up in thee.</p>
<p>PYRAMUS [BOTTOM] I see a voice; now will I to the chink,</p>
<p>To spy an 948 I can hear my Thisbe’s face. Thisbe?</p>
<p>THISBE [FLUTE] My love 949 thou art, my love I think.</p>
<p>PYRAMUS [BOTTOM] Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace 950</p>
<p>And like Limander 951 am I trusty still.</p>
<p>THISBE [FLUTE] And I like Helen 952 , till the Fates me kill.</p>
<p>PYRAMUS [BOTTOM] Not Shafalus to Procrus 953 was so true.</p>
<p>THISBE [FLUTE] As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.</p>
<p>PYRAMUS [BOTTOM] O, kiss me through the hole 954 of this vile
wall!</p>
<p>THISBE [FLUTE] I kiss the wall’s hole, not your lips at all.</p>
<p>PYRAMUS [BOTTOM] Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?</p>
<p>THISBE [FLUTE] ’Tide 955 life, ’tide death, I come without delay.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe ]</p>
<p>WALL [SNOUT] Thus have I, Wall, my part dischargèd so;</p>
<p>And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>THESEUS Now is the mural 956 down between the two neighbours.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear 957
without warning.</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA This is the silliest stuff that e’er I heard.</p>
<p>THESEUS The best in this kind 958 are but shadows 959 , and the worst
are no worse, if imagination amend them.</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.</p>
<p>THESEUS If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they
may pass for excellent men. Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a
lion.</p>
<p>Enter Lion and Moonshine [with a lantern, thorn-bush and dog ]</p>
<p>LION [SNUG] You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear</p>
<p>The smallest monstrous 960 mouse that creeps on floor,</p>
<p>May now perchance both quake and tremble here,</p>
<p>When lion rough 961 in wildest rage doth roar.</p>
<p>Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am</p>
<p>A lion fell 962 , nor else no lion’s dam 963 ,</p>
<p>For if I should as lion come in strife</p>
<p>Into this place, ’twere pity on my life.</p>
<p>THESEUS A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS The very best at 964 a beast 965 , my lord, that e’er I
saw.</p>
<p>LYSANDER This lion is a very fox 966 for 967 his valour.</p>
<p>THESEUS True, and a goose for his discretion 968 .</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Not so, my lord, for his valour cannot carry his discretion
969 , and the fox carries 970 the goose.</p>
<p>THESEUS His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour, for the
goose carries not the fox. It is well. Leave it to his discretion, and
let us hearken to the moon.</p>
<p>MOONSHINE [STARVELING] This lantern doth the hornèd 971 moon
present—</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS He should have worn the horns on his head 972 .</p>
<p>THESEUS He is no crescent 973 , and his horns are invisible within
the circumference.</p>
<p>MOONSHINE [STARVELING] This lantern doth the hornèd moon present:
Myself the man i’th’moon doth seem to be.</p>
<p>THESEUS This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man should be
put into the lantern. How is it else the man i’th’moon?</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS He dares not come there for the candle. For you see it is
already in snuff 974 .</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA I am aweary of this moon; would he would change!</p>
<p>THESEUS It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is in
the wane 975 . But yet, in courtesy, in all reason 976 , we must stay
the time 977 .</p>
<p>LYSANDER Proceed, Moon.</p>
<p>MOONSHINE [STARVELING] All that I have to say is to tell you that the
lantern is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this thorn-bush, my
thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Why, all these should be in the lantern, for they are in
the moon. But silence — here comes Thisbe.</p>
<p>Enter Thisbe</p>
<p>THISBE [FLUTE] This is old Ninny’s tomb. Where is my love?</p>
<p>LION [SNUG] O!</p>
<p>The lion roars. Thisbe runs off [dropping her mantle ]</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Well roared, Lion.</p>
<p>THESEUS Well run, Thisbe.</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good
grace.</p>
<p>[Lion shakes Thisbe’s mantle, and exits ]</p>
<p>THESEUS Well moused 978 , Lion.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS And then came Pyramus.</p>
<p>LYSANDER And so the lion vanished.</p>
<p>Enter Pyramus</p>
<p>PYRAMUS [BOTTOM] Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams,</p>
<p>I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright,</p>
<p>For by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,</p>
<p>I trust to taste of truest Thisbe sight.</p>
<p>But stay, O spite!</p>
<p>But mark, poor knight,</p>
<p>What dreadful dole 979 is here?</p>
<p>Eyes, do you see?</p>
<p>How can it be?</p>
<p>O dainty duck! O dear!</p>
<p>Thy mantle good,</p>
<p>What, stained with blood!</p>
<p>Approach, you Furies 980 fell 981 !</p>
<p>O Fates 982 , come, come,</p>
<p>Cut thread and thrum 983 ,</p>
<p>Quail 984 , crush, conclude, and quell 985 !</p>
<p>THESEUS This passion 986 , and the death of a dear friend 987 , would
go near to 988 make a man look sad.</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA Beshrew 989 my heart, but I pity the man.</p>
<p>PYRAMUS [BOTTOM] O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame 990
?</p>
<p>Since lion vile hath here deflowered 991 my dear:</p>
<p>Which is — no, no — which was the fairest dame</p>
<p>That lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with cheer 992 .</p>
<p>Come, tears, confound:</p>
<p>Out, sword, and wound</p>
<p>The pap 993 of Pyramus,</p>
<p>Ay, that left pap,</p>
<p>Where heart doth hop:</p>
<p>Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.</p>
<p>Stabs himself</p>
<p>Now am I dead,</p>
<p>Now am I fled,</p>
<p>My soul is in the sky.</p>
<p>Tongue 994 , lose thy light,</p>
<p>Moon take thy flight,</p>
<p>[Exit Moonshine ]</p>
<p>Now die 995 , die, die, die, die.</p>
<p>Dies</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS No die, but an ace 996 for him; for he is but one.</p>
<p>LYSANDER Less than an ace, man: for he is dead, he is nothing.</p>
<p>THESEUS With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and prove an
ass 997 .</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and
finds her lover?</p>
<p>Enter Thisbe</p>
<p>THESEUS She will find him by starlight. Here she comes, and her
passion 998 ends the play.</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA Methinks she should not use a long one 999 for such a
Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS A mote 1000 will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
Thisbe, is the better.</p>
<p>LYSANDER She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS And thus she means 1001 , videlicet 1002 —</p>
<p>THISBE [FLUTE] Asleep, my love?</p>
<p>What, dead, my dove?</p>
<p>O Pyramus, arise!</p>
<p>Speak, speak. Quite dumb?</p>
<p>Dead, dead? A tomb</p>
<p>Must cover thy sweet eyes.</p>
<p>These lily lips,</p>
<p>This cherry nose,</p>
<p>These yellow cowslip cheeks,</p>
<p>Are gone, are gone!</p>
<p>Lovers, make moan:</p>
<p>His eyes were green as leeks.</p>
<p>O Sisters Three 1003 ,</p>
<p>Come, come to me,</p>
<p>With hands as pale as milk.</p>
<p>Lay them in gore,</p>
<p>Since you have shore 1004</p>
<p>With shears his thread of silk 1005 .</p>
<p>Tongue, not a word.</p>
<p>Come, trusty sword,</p>
<p>Come, blade, my breast imbrue 1006 .</p>
<p>Stabs herself</p>
<p>And farewell friends,</p>
<p>Thus Thisbe ends:</p>
<p>Adieu, adieu, adieu.</p>
<p>Dies</p>
<p>THESEUS Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Ay, and Wall too.</p>
<p>BOTTOM No, I assure you, the wall is down that parted their fathers.
Will it please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance
1007 between 1008 two of our company?</p>
<p>Gets up</p>
<p>THESEUS No epilogue, I pray you, for your play needs no excuse. Never
excuse; for when the players are all dead, there need none to be blamed.
Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hung himself in
Thisbe’s garter, it would have been a fine tragedy: and so it is, truly,
and very notably discharged. But come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue
alone.</p>
<p>A dance</p>
<p>The iron tongue 1009 of midnight hath told 1010 twelve.</p>
<p>Lovers, to bed, ’tis almost fairy time.</p>
<p>I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn</p>
<p>As much as we this night have overwatched 1011 .</p>
<p>This palpable-gross 1012 play hath well beguiled 1013</p>
<p>The heavy gait 1014 of night. Sweet friends, to bed.</p>
<p>A fortnight hold we this solemnity 1015 ,</p>
<p>In nightly revels and new jollity.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Enter [Robin ] Puck</p>
<p>With a broom</p>
<p>ROBIN Now the hungry lion roars,</p>
<p>And the wolf beholds the moon.</p>
<p>Whilst the heavy 1016 ploughman snores,</p>
<p>All with weary task fordone 1017 .</p>
<p>Now the wasted brands 1018 do glow,</p>
<p>Whilst the screech-owl 1019 , screeching loud,</p>
<p>Puts the wretch that lies in woe</p>
<p>In remembrance of a shroud.</p>
<p>Now it is the time of night</p>
<p>That the graves all gaping wide,</p>
<p>Every one lets forth his sprite 1020 ,</p>
<p>In the church-way paths to glide.</p>
<p>And we fairies that do run</p>
<p>By the triple Hecate 1021 ’s team 1022 ,</p>
<p>From the presence of the sun,</p>
<p>Following darkness like a dream,</p>
<p>Now are frolic 1023 ; not a mouse</p>
<p>Shall disturb this hallowed 1024 house.</p>
<p>I am sent with broom before,</p>
<p>To sweep the dust behind 1025 the door.</p>
<p>Enter King and Queen of Fairies [Oberon and Titania ] with their
train</p>
<p>OBERON Through the house give glimmering light 1026 ,</p>
<p>By the dead and drowsy fire,</p>
<p>Every elf and fairy sprite</p>
<p>Hop as light as bird from briar,</p>
<p>And this ditty, after me,</p>
<p>Sing, and dance it trippingly 1027 .</p>
<p>TITANIA First, rehearse 1028 this song by rote 1029 ,</p>
<p>To each word a warbling note.</p>
<p>Hand in hand, with fairy grace,</p>
<p>Will we sing and bless this place.</p>
<p>[FAIRIES sing ] The Song</p>
<p>Fairies dance</p>
<p>Now until the break of day</p>
<p>Through this house each fairy stray.</p>
<p>To the best bride-bed 1030 will we,</p>
<p>Which by us shall blessèd be.</p>
<p>And the issue 1031 there create 1032</p>
<p>Ever shall be fortunate.</p>
<p>So shall all the couples three</p>
<p>Ever true in loving be.</p>
<p>And the blots of Nature’s hand</p>
<p>Shall not in their issue stand.</p>
<p>Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar,</p>
<p>Nor mark prodigious 1033 , such as are</p>
<p>Despisèd in nativity,</p>
<p>Shall upon their children be.</p>
<p>With this field-dew consecrate 1034 ,</p>
<p>Every fairy take his gait 1035 ,</p>
<p>And each several 1036 chamber bless,</p>
<p>Through this palace, with sweet peace.</p>
<p>Ever shall in safety rest,</p>
<p>And the owner of it blest.</p>
<p>Trip away, make no stay 1037 ;</p>
<p>Meet me all by break of day.</p>
<p>[Exeunt all but Robin ]</p>
<p>ROBIN If we shadows have offended,</p>
<p>Think but this, and all is mended,</p>
<p>That you have but slumbered here</p>
<p>While these visions did appear.</p>
<p>And this weak 1038 and idle 1039 theme,</p>
<p>No more yielding but 1040 a dream,</p>
<p>Gentles 1041 , do not reprehend 1042 .</p>
<p>If you pardon, we will mend 1043 .</p>
<p>And, as I am an honest Puck,</p>
<p>If we have unearnèd luck</p>
<p>Now to scape the serpent’s tongue 1044 ,</p>
<p>We will make amends ere long:</p>
<p>Else the Puck a liar call.</p>
<p>So, goodnight unto you all.</p>
<p>Give me your hands 1045 , if we be friends,</p>
<p>And Robin shall restore amends 1046 .</p>
