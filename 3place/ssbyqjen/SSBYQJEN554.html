<p>Enter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio and Attendants</p>
<p>OTHELLO Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight:</p>
<p>Let’s teach ourselves that honourable stop 750</p>
<p>Not to outsport discretion 751 .</p>
<p>CASSIO Iago hath direction what to do,</p>
<p>But notwithstanding, with my personal eye</p>
<p>Will I look to’t.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Iago is most honest.</p>
<p>Michael, goodnight: tomorrow with your earliest 752</p>
<p>Let me have speech with you.—</p>
<p>Come, my dear love,</p>
<p>To Desdemona</p>
<p>The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue 753 :</p>
<p>That profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you.—</p>
<p>Goodnight.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Othello, Desdemona and Attendants ]</p>
<p>Enter Iago</p>
<p>CASSIO Welcome, Iago: we must to the watch.</p>
<p>IAGO Not this hour, lieutenant: ’tis not yet ten o’th’clock. Our
general cast 754 us thus early for the love of his Desdemona, who let us
not therefore blame: he hath not yet made wanton 755 the night with her,
and she is sport for Jove 756 .</p>
<p>CASSIO She’s a most exquisite 757 lady.</p>
<p>IAGO And, I’ll warrant her, full of game 758 .</p>
<p>CASSIO Indeed, she’s a most fresh and delicate 759 creature.</p>
<p>IAGO What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley 760 to
provocation.</p>
<p>CASSIO An inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.</p>
<p>IAGO And when she speaks, is it not an alarum 761 to love?</p>
<p>CASSIO She is indeed perfection.</p>
<p>IAGO Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a
stoup 762 of wine, and here without 763 are a brace 764 of Cyprus
gallants 765 that would fain 766 have a measure 767 to the health of
black Othello.</p>
<p>CASSIO Not tonight, good Iago: I have very poor and unhappy 768
brains for drinking: I could well wish courtesy would invent some other
custom of entertainment.</p>
<p>IAGO O, they are our friends. But one cup: I’ll drink for you.</p>
<p>CASSIO I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily 769
qualified too, and behold what innovation 770 it makes here: I am
infortunate 771 in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any
more.</p>
<p>IAGO What, man? ’Tis a night of revels: the gallants desire it.</p>
<p>CASSIO Where are they?</p>
<p>IAGO Here at the door. I pray you call them in.</p>
<p>CASSIO I’ll do’t, but it dislikes me 772 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>IAGO If I can fasten but one cup upon him,</p>
<p>With that which he hath drunk tonight already,</p>
<p>He’ll be as full of quarrel and offence 773</p>
<p>As my young mistress’ dog 774 . Now, my sick 775 fool Rodorigo,</p>
<p>Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out,</p>
<p>To Desdemona hath tonight caroused 776</p>
<p>Potations pottle-deep 777 ; and he’s to watch 778 :</p>
<p>Three else of Cyprus, noble swelling 779 spirits —</p>
<p>That hold their honours in a wary distance 780 ,</p>
<p>The very elements 781 of this warlike isle —</p>
<p>Have I tonight flustered 782 with flowing cups,</p>
<p>And they watch 783 too. Now, ’mongst this flock of drunkards</p>
<p>Am I to put our Cassio in some action 784</p>
<p>That may offend the isle.— But here they come:</p>
<p>Enter Cassio, Montano and Gentlemen</p>
<p>Servants following with wine</p>
<p>If consequence do but approve 785 my dream,</p>
<p>My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream 786 .</p>
<p>CASSIO ’Fore heaven, they have given me a rouse 787 already.</p>
<p>MONTANO Good faith, a little one, not past a pint, as I am a
soldier.</p>
<p>IAGO Some wine, ho!</p>
<p>And let me the cannikin 788 clink, clink,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>And let me the cannikin clink.</p>
<p>A soldier’s a man,</p>
<p>O, man’s life’s but a span 789 :</p>
<p>Why, then, let a soldier drink.</p>
<p>Some wine, boys!</p>
<p>CASSIO ’Fore heaven, an excellent song.</p>
<p>IAGO I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in
potting 790 : your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied 791
Hollander— Drink, ho!— are nothing to your English.</p>
<p>CASSIO Is your Englishman so exquisite in his drinking?</p>
<p>IAGO Why, he drinks you 792 with facility, your Dane dead drunk: he
sweats not to overthrow your Almain 793 : he gives your Hollander a
vomit ere the next pottle 794 can be filled.</p>
<p>CASSIO To the health of our general!</p>
<p>MONTANO I am for it, lieutenant, and I’ll do you justice 795 .</p>
<p>IAGO O sweet England!</p>
<p>King Stephen 796 was and-a 797 worthy peer,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>His breeches cost him but a crown 798 :</p>
<p>He held 799 them sixpence all too dear,</p>
<p>With that he called the tailor lown 800 .</p>
<p>He was a wight of high renown,</p>
<p>And thou art but of low degree:</p>
<p>’Tis pride that pulls the country down:</p>
<p>Then take thy auld 801 cloak about thee.</p>
<p>Some wine, ho!</p>
<p>CASSIO Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.</p>
<p>IAGO Will you hear’t again?</p>
<p>CASSIO No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those
things. Well, heav’n’s above all, and there be souls must be saved, and
there be souls must not be saved.</p>
<p>IAGO It’s true, good lieutenant.</p>
<p>CASSIO For mine own part — no offence to the general, nor any man of
quality 802 — I hope to be saved.</p>
<p>IAGO And so do I too, lieutenant.</p>
<p>CASSIO Ay, but, by your leave, not before me: the lieutenant is to be
saved before the ancient. Let’s have no more of this: let’s to our
affairs. Forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let’s look to our business. Do
not think, gentlemen, I am drunk: this is my ancient, this is my right
hand, and this is my left. I am not drunk now: I can stand well enough,
and I speak well enough.</p>
<p>GENTLEMEN Excellent well.</p>
<p>CASSIO Why, very well then: you must not think then, that I am
drunk.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>MONTANO To th’platform 803 , masters. Come, let’s set the watch 804
.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Gentlemen? ]</p>
<p>Starts to leave</p>
<p>IAGO You see this fellow that is gone before:</p>
<p>To Monta</p>
<p>He’s a soldier fit to stand by Caesar</p>
<p>And give direction. And do but see his vice:</p>
<p>’Tis to his virtue a just equinox 805 806 ,</p>
<p>The one as long as th’other. ’Tis pity of 807 him.</p>
<p>I fear the trust Othello puts him in</p>
<p>On some odd time of his infirmity</p>
<p>Will shake this island.</p>
<p>MONTANO But is he often thus?</p>
<p>IAGO ’Tis evermore his prologue to his sleep:</p>
<p>He’ll watch the horologe a double set 808 ,</p>
<p>If drink rock not his cradle.</p>
<p>MONTANO It were well</p>
<p>The general were put in mind of it.</p>
<p>Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature</p>
<p>Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio</p>
<p>And looks not on his evils: is not this true?</p>
<p>Enter Rodorigo</p>
<p>IAGO How now, Rodorigo?</p>
<p>Aside to Rodorigo</p>
<p>I pray you, after the lieutenant, go.</p>
<p>[Exit Rodorigo ]</p>
<p>MONTANO And’tis great pity that the noble Moor</p>
<p>Should hazard such a place as his own second 809</p>
<p>With one of an ingraft 810 infirmity:</p>
<p>It were an honest action to say so</p>
<p>To the Moor.</p>
<p>IAGO Not I, for this fair island:</p>
<p>I do love Cassio well and would do much</p>
<p>To cure him of this evil.—</p>
<p>Cry within</p>
<p>But, hark! What noise?</p>
<p>Enter Cassio pursuing Rodorigo</p>
<p>CASSIO You rogue! You rascal!</p>
<p>MONTANO What’s the matter, lieutenant?</p>
<p>CASSIO A knave 811 teach me my duty?</p>
<p>I’ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle 812 .</p>
<p>RODORIGO Beat me?</p>
<p>CASSIO Dost thou prate, rogue?</p>
<p>Strikes Rodorigo</p>
<p>MONTANO Nay, good lieutenant:</p>
<p>Stops him</p>
<p>I pray you, sir, hold 813 your hand.</p>
<p>CASSIO Let me go, sir,</p>
<p>Or I’ll knock you o’er the mazzard 814 .</p>
<p>MONTANO Come, come, you’re drunk.</p>
<p>CASSIO Drunk?</p>
<p>They fight</p>
<p>IAGO Away, I say: go out and cry a mutiny.—</p>
<p>Aside to Rodorigo</p>
<p>[Exit Rodorigo ]</p>
<p>Nay, good lieutenant— Alas, gentlemen—</p>
<p>Help, ho!— Lieutenant— Sir Montano— Sir—</p>
<p>Help, masters 815 !— Here’s a goodly watch indeed!</p>
<p>Bell rings</p>
<p>Who’s that which rings the bell 816 ?— Diablo 817 , ho!</p>
<p>The town will rise 818 . Fie, fie, lieutenant!</p>
<p>You’ll be ashamed 819 for ever.</p>
<p>Enter Othello and Attendants</p>
<p>With weapons</p>
<p>OTHELLO What is the matter here?</p>
<p>MONTANO I bleed still: I am hurt to th’death. He dies!</p>
<p>Attacks Cassio?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Hold, for your lives!</p>
<p>IAGO Hold, ho! Lieutenant— Sir Montano— Gentlemen,</p>
<p>Have you forgot all sense of place 820 and duty?</p>
<p>Hold! The general speaks to you. Hold, for shame!</p>
<p>OTHELLO Why, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this?</p>
<p>Are we turned Turks 821 , and to ourselves do that</p>
<p>Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites 822 ?</p>
<p>For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl!</p>
<p>He that stirs next to carve 823 for his own rage</p>
<p>Holds his soul light 824 : he dies 825 upon his motion.—</p>
<p>Silence that dreadful 826 bell: it frights the isle</p>
<p>From her propriety 827 .— What is the matter, masters?</p>
<p>Honest Iago, that looks dead with grieving 828 ,</p>
<p>Speak: who began this? On thy love 829 , I charge thee.</p>
<p>IAGO I do not know. Friends all but now, even now,</p>
<p>In quarter 830 and in terms 831 like bride and groom</p>
<p>Devesting them 832 for bed: and then, but now —</p>
<p>As if some planet had unwitted men 833 —</p>
<p>Swords out, and tilting 834 one at other’s breasts</p>
<p>In opposition bloody. I cannot speak</p>
<p>Any beginning to this peevish odds 835 ,</p>
<p>And would 836 in action glorious I had lost</p>
<p>Those legs that brought me to a part of it!</p>
<p>OTHELLO How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot 837 ?</p>
<p>CASSIO I pray you pardon me: I cannot speak.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Worthy Montano, you were wont 838 to be civil:</p>
<p>The gravity and stillness 839 of your youth</p>
<p>The world hath noted, and your name is great</p>
<p>In mouths of wisest censure 840 . What’s the matter</p>
<p>That you unlace 841 your reputation thus</p>
<p>And spend your rich opinion 842 for the name</p>
<p>Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.</p>
<p>MONTANO Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:</p>
<p>Your officer, Iago, can inform you —</p>
<p>While I spare speech, which something now offends 843 me —</p>
<p>Of all that I do know, nor know I aught 844</p>
<p>By me that’s said or done amiss this night,</p>
<p>Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,</p>
<p>And to defend ourselves it be a sin</p>
<p>When violence assails us.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Now, by heaven,</p>
<p>My blood 845 begins my safer guides 846 to rule,</p>
<p>And passion — having my best judgement collied 847 —</p>
<p>Assays 848 to lead the way: if I once stir,</p>
<p>Or do but lift this arm, the best of you</p>
<p>Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know</p>
<p>How this foul rout 849 began, who set it on,</p>
<p>And he that is approved 850 in this offence,</p>
<p>Though he had twinned with me, both at a birth 851 ,</p>
<p>Shall lose me. What, in a town of war 852</p>
<p>Yet wild 853 , the people’s hearts brim-full of fear,</p>
<p>To manage 854 855 private and domestic quarrel?</p>
<p>In night, and on the court and guard of safety?</p>
<p>’Tis monstrous 856 . Iago, who began’t?</p>
<p>MONTANO If partially affined, or leagued in office 857 ,</p>
<p>To lago</p>
<p>Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,</p>
<p>Thou art no soldier.</p>
<p>IAGO Touch 858 me not so near 859 :</p>
<p>I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth</p>
<p>Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio,</p>
<p>Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth</p>
<p>Shall nothing wrong him. This it is, general:</p>
<p>Indicates Montano</p>
<p>Montano and myself being in speech,</p>
<p>There comes a fellow crying out for help,</p>
<p>And Cassio following him with determined sword</p>
<p>To execute upon him 860 . Sir, this gentleman</p>
<p>Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause 861 :</p>
<p>Myself the crying fellow did pursue,</p>
<p>Lest by his clamour — as it so fell out —</p>
<p>The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,</p>
<p>Outran my purpose, and I returned then rather</p>
<p>For that 862 I heard the clink and fall of swords</p>
<p>And Cassio high in oath 863 , which till tonight</p>
<p>I ne’er might say before. When I came back —</p>
<p>For this was brief — I found them close together</p>
<p>At blow and thrust, even as again they were</p>
<p>When you yourself did part them.</p>
<p>More of this matter cannot I report.</p>
<p>But men are men: the best sometimes forget 864 :</p>
<p>Though Cassio did some little wrong to him 865 ,</p>
<p>As men in rage strike those that wish them best,</p>
<p>Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received</p>
<p>From him that fled some strange indignity 866 ,</p>
<p>Which patience could not pass 867 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO I know, Iago,</p>
<p>Thy honesty and love doth mince 868 this matter,</p>
<p>Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee,</p>
<p>But never more be officer of mine.</p>
<p>Enter Desdemona, attended</p>
<p>Look, if my gentle love be not raised up.</p>
<p>I’ll make thee an example.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA What is the matter, dear?</p>
<p>OTHELLO All’s well, sweeting 869 :</p>
<p>Come away to bed.— Sir, for your hurts,</p>
<p>To Montano</p>
<p>Myself will be your surgeon 870 .— Lead him off.</p>
<p>[Exeunt some with Montano ]</p>
<p>Iago, look with care about the town</p>
<p>And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted 871 .—</p>
<p>Come, Desdemona: ‘tis the soldiers’ life</p>
<p>To have their balmy 872 slumbers waked with strife.</p>
<p>Exeunt [all but Iago and Cassio ]</p>
<p>IAGO What, are you hurt, lieutenant?</p>
<p>CASSIO Ay, past all surgery.</p>
<p>IAGO Marry, heaven forbid!</p>
<p>CASSIO Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my
reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is
bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation!</p>
<p>IAGO As I am an honest man, I had thought you had received some
bodily wound; there is more sense 873 in that than in reputation.
Reputation is an idle 874 and most false imposition 875 : oft got
without merit and lost without deserving: you have lost no reputation at
all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man, there are more
ways to recover 876 the general again: you are but now cast in his mood
877 — a punishment more in policy than in malice — even so as one would
beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to 878 him
again and he’s yours.</p>
<p>CASSIO I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a
commander with so slight 879 , so drunken and so indiscreet 880 an
officer. Drunk? And speak parrot 881 ? And squabble? Swagger? Swear? And
discourse fustian 882 with one’s own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of
wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!</p>
<p>IAGO What 883 was he that you followed with your sword? What had he
done to you?</p>
<p>CASSIO I know not.</p>
<p>IAGO Is’t possible?</p>
<p>CASSIO I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly: a
quarrel, but nothing wherefore 884 . O, that men should put an enemy in
their mouths to steal away their brains! That we should, with joy,
pleasance 885 , revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts!</p>
<p>IAGO Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus
recovered?</p>
<p>CASSIO It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the
devil wrath: one unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly 886
despise myself.</p>
<p>IAGO Come, you are too severe a moraler 887 . As the time, the place
and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had
not befallen: but since it is as it is, mend it 888 for your own
good.</p>
<p>CASSIO I will ask him for my place again: he shall tell me I am a
drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra 889 , such an answer would stop
890 them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently
a beast! O, strange! Every inordinate 891 cup is unblessed, and the
ingredient is a devil.</p>
<p>IAGO Come, come, good wine is a good familiar 892 creature, if it be
well used: exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you
think I love you.</p>
<p>CASSIO I have well approved it 893 , sir. I drunk?</p>
<p>IAGO You or any man living may be drunk at a time 894 , man. I tell
you what you shall do. Our general’s wife is now the general: I may say
so in this respect, for that 895 he hath devoted and given up himself to
the contemplation, mark, and denotement 896 of her parts 897 and graces:
confess yourself freely to her, importune 898 her help to put you in
your place again. She is of so free 899 , so kind, so apt 900 , so
blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do
more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her
husband entreat her to splinter 901 , and, my fortunes against any lay
902 worth naming, this crack 903 of your love shall grow stronger than
it was before.</p>
<p>CASSIO You advise me well.</p>
<p>IAGO I protest 904 , in the sincerity of love and honest
kindness.</p>
<p>CASSIO I think it freely 905 , and betimes 906 in the morning I will
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake 907 for me: I am desperate
of 908 my fortunes if they check 909 me.</p>
<p>IAGO You are in the right. Goodnight, lieutenant: I must to the
watch.</p>
<p>CASSIO Goodnight, honest Iago.</p>
<p>Exit Cassio</p>
<p>IAGO And what’s he then that says I play the villain?</p>
<p>When this advice is free 910 I give, and honest,</p>
<p>Probal 911 to thinking, and indeed the course</p>
<p>To win the Moor again? For’tis most easy</p>
<p>Th’inclining 912 Desdemona to subdue 913</p>
<p>In any honest suit: she’s framed as fruitful 914</p>
<p>As the free elements. And then for her</p>
<p>To win the Moor — were’t to renounce his baptism,</p>
<p>All seals 915 and symbols of redeemèd sin —</p>
<p>His soul is so enfettered 916 to her love</p>
<p>That she may make, unmake, do what she list 917 ,</p>
<p>Even as her appetite 918 shall play the god</p>
<p>With his weak function 919 . How am I then a villain</p>
<p>To counsel Cassio to this parallel 920 course</p>
<p>Directly to his good? Divinity 921 of hell!</p>
<p>When devils will the blackest sins put on 922 ,</p>
<p>They do suggest 923 at first with heavenly shows,</p>
<p>As I do now. For whiles this honest fool</p>
<p>Plies 924 Desdemona to repair his fortune,</p>
<p>And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,</p>
<p>I’ll pour this pestilence 925 into his ear,</p>
<p>That she repeals him 926 for her body’s lust,</p>
<p>And by how much she strives to do him good,</p>
<p>She shall undo her credit 927 with the Moor.</p>
<p>So will I turn her virtue into pitch 928 ,</p>
<p>And out of her own goodness make the net</p>
<p>That shall enmesh them all.—</p>
<p>Enter Rodorigo</p>
<p>How now, Rodorigo?</p>
<p>RODORIGO I do follow here in the chase 929 , not like a hound that
hunts, but one that fills up the cry 930 . My money is almost spent; I
have been tonight exceedingly well cudgelled 931 , and I think the issue
932 will be I shall have so much experience for my pains, and so, with
no money at all and a little more wit 933 , return again to Venice.</p>
<p>IAGO How poor are they that have not patience!</p>
<p>What wound did ever heal but by degrees?</p>
<p>Thou know’st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft,</p>
<p>And wit depends on dilatory 934 time.</p>
<p>335 Does’t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,</p>
<p>And thou, by that small hurt, hath cashiered 935 Cassio.</p>
<p>Though other things grow fair against 936 the sun,</p>
<p>Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe 937 .</p>
<p>Content thyself awhile. In troth 938 , ’tis morning;</p>
<p>Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.</p>
<p>Retire thee: go where thou art billeted.</p>
<p>Away, I say! Thou shalt know more hereafter.</p>
<p>Nay, get thee gone.</p>
<p>Exit Rodorigo</p>
<p>Two things are to be done:</p>
<p>My wife must move 939 for Cassio to her mistress:</p>
<p>I’ll set her on:</p>
<p>Myself the while 940 to draw the Moor apart</p>
<p>And bring him jump 941 when he may Cassio find</p>
<p>Soliciting his wife: ay, that’s the way.</p>
<p>Dull not device 942 by coldness and delay.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
