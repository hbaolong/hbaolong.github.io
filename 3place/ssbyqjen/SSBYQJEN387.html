scene 10 continues</h4>
<p>Enter Lucius, Marcus and the Goths [with Aaron prisoner and one
carrying the child ]</p>
<p>LUCIUS Uncle Marcus, since ’tis my father’s mind</p>
<p>That I repair to Rome, I am content.</p>
<p>A GOTH And ours with thine 963 , befall what fortune will.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,</p>
<p>This ravenous tiger, this accursèd devil:</p>
<p>Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him</p>
<p>Till he be brought unto the empress’ face</p>
<p>For testimony of her foul proceedings.</p>
<p>And see the ambush 964 of our friends be strong:</p>
<p>I fear the emperor means no good to us.</p>
<p>AARON Some devil whisper curses in my ear,</p>
<p>And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth</p>
<p>The venomous malice of my swelling heart.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Away, inhuman dog, unhallowed slave!—</p>
<p>Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.</p>
<p>Flourish . [Exeunt some Goths with Aaron ]</p>
<p>The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.</p>
<p>Sound trumpets. Enter Emperor and Empress, with Tribunes and others
[including Emillius ]</p>
<p>SATURNINUS What, hath the firmament 965 more suns than one?</p>
<p>LUCIUS What boots 966 it thee to call thyself a sun?</p>
<p>MARCUS Rome’s emperor, and nephew, break the parle 967 :</p>
<p>These quarrels must be quietly debated.</p>
<p>The feast is ready which the careful 968 Titus</p>
<p>Hath ordainèd to an honourable end,</p>
<p>For peace, for love, for league and good to Rome:</p>
<p>Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Marcus, we will.</p>
<p>Hautboys 969 . A table brought in</p>
<p>Enter Titus like a cook, placing the meat on the table, and Lavinia
with a veil over her face [and Young Lucius]</p>
<p>TITUS Welcome, my gracious lord.— Welcome, dread queen.—</p>
<p>Welcome, ye warlike Goths.— Welcome, Lucius.—</p>
<p>And welcome, all. Although the cheer 970 be poor,</p>
<p>’Twill fill your stomachs. Please you eat of it.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?</p>
<p>TITUS Because I would be sure to have all well</p>
<p>To entertain your highness and your empress.</p>
<p>TAMORA We are beholding 971 to you, good Andronicus.</p>
<p>TITUS An if your highness knew my heart, you were.</p>
<p>My lord the emperor, resolve me this:</p>
<p>Was it well done of rash Virginius 972</p>
<p>To slay his daughter with his own right hand,</p>
<p>Because 973 she was enforced, stained and deflowered?</p>
<p>SATURNINUS It was, Andronicus.</p>
<p>TITUS Your reason, mighty lord?</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Because the girl should not survive her shame,</p>
<p>And by her presence still 974 renew his sorrows.</p>
<p>TITUS A reason mighty, strong and effectual:</p>
<p>A pattern, precedent and lively 975 warrant 976</p>
<p>For me, most wretched, to perform the like.</p>
<p>Unveils Lavinia</p>
<p>Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee,</p>
<p>And with thy shame thy father’s sorrow die!</p>
<p>He kills her</p>
<p>SATURNINUS What hast done? Unnatural and unkind 977 !</p>
<p>TITUS Killed her for whom my tears have made me blind.</p>
<p>I am as woeful as Virginius was,</p>
<p>And have a thousand times more cause than he</p>
<p>To do this outrage 978 : and it now is done.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS What, was she ravished? Tell who did the deed.</p>
<p>TITUS Will’t please you eat? Will’t please your highness feed?</p>
<p>TAMORA Why hast thou slain thine only daughter?</p>
<p>TITUS Not I, ’twas Chiron and Demetrius:</p>
<p>They ravished her and cut away her tongue,</p>
<p>And they, ’twas they, that did her all this wrong.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Go fetch them hither to us presently.</p>
<p>TITUS Why, there they are both, bakèd in that pie,</p>
<p>Whereof their mother daintily 979 hath fed,</p>
<p>Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.</p>
<p>’Tis true, ’tis true, witness my knife’s sharp point.</p>
<p>He stabs the Empress</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Die, frantic wretch, for this accursèd deed!</p>
<p>Kills Titus</p>
<p>LUCIUS Can the son’s eye behold his father bleed?</p>
<p>There’s meed for meed 980 , death for a deadly deed.</p>
<p>Kills Saturninus. An uproar, during which Lucius and Marcus may go
aloft</p>
<p>MARCUS You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,</p>
<p>By uproars severed, like a flight of fowl</p>
<p>Scattered by winds and high tempestuous gusts,</p>
<p>O, let me teach you how to knit again</p>
<p>This scattered corn into one mutual 981 sheaf,</p>
<p>These broken limbs again into one body.</p>
<p>A GOTH Let Rome herself be bane 982 unto herself,</p>
<p>And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,</p>
<p>Like a forlorn 983 and desperate castaway,</p>
<p>Do shameful execution on herself.</p>
<p>MARCUS But if my frosty signs 984 and chaps 985 of age,</p>
<p>Grave witnesses of true experience,</p>
<p>Cannot induce you to attend my words,</p>
<p>Speak, Rome’s dear friend, as erst 986 our ancestor 987 ,</p>
<p>To Lucius</p>
<p>When with his solemn tongue he did discourse</p>
<p>To lovesick Dido’s sad attending ear</p>
<p>The story of that baleful 988 burning night</p>
<p>When subtle 989 Greeks surprised King Priam’s Troy 990 .</p>
<p>Tell us what Sinon 991 hath bewitched our ears,</p>
<p>Or who hath brought the fatal engine 992 in</p>
<p>That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.</p>
<p>My heart is not compact 993 of flint nor steel,</p>
<p>Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,</p>
<p>But floods of tears will drown my oratory</p>
<p>And break my very utterance, even in the time</p>
<p>When it should move you to attend me most,</p>
<p>Lending your kind hand commiseration.</p>
<p>Here is a captain, let him tell the tale:</p>
<p>Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.</p>
<p>LUCIUS This, noble auditory 994 , be it known to you,</p>
<p>That cursèd Chiron and Demetrius</p>
<p>Were they that murderèd our emperor’s brother,</p>
<p>And they it were that ravishèd our sister.</p>
<p>For their fell 995 faults our brothers were beheaded,</p>
<p>Our father’s tears despised and basely cozened 996</p>
<p>Of that true hand that fought Rome’s quarrel out 997 ,</p>
<p>And sent her enemies unto the grave.</p>
<p>Lastly, myself unkindly 998 banishèd,</p>
<p>The gates shut on me, and turned weeping out,</p>
<p>To beg relief among Rome’s enemies,</p>
<p>Who drowned their enmity in my true tears</p>
<p>And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.</p>
<p>And I am turned forth, be it known to you,</p>
<p>That have preserved her welfare in my blood,</p>
<p>And from her bosom took the enemy’s point,</p>
<p>Sheathing the steel in my advent’rous 999 body.</p>
<p>Alas, you know I am no vaunter 1000 , I:</p>
<p>My scars can witness, dumb although they are,</p>
<p>That my report is just and full of truth.</p>
<p>But soft, methinks I do digress too much,</p>
<p>Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me,</p>
<p>For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.</p>
<p>MARCUS Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:</p>
<p>Points to the baby</p>
<p>Of this was Tamora deliverèd,</p>
<p>The issue of an irreligious Moor,</p>
<p>Chief architect and plotter of these woes.</p>
<p>The villain is alive in Titus’ house,</p>
<p>And as he is to witness this is true,</p>
<p>Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge</p>
<p>These wrongs unspeakable, past patience,</p>
<p>Or more than any living man could bear.</p>
<p>Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?</p>
<p>Have we done aught 1001 amiss? Show us wherein,</p>
<p>And from the place where you behold us now,</p>
<p>The poor remainder of Andronici 1002</p>
<p>Will hand in hand all headlong cast us down</p>
<p>And on the ragged 1003 stones beat forth our brains</p>
<p>And make a mutual closure of our house.</p>
<p>Speak, Romans, speak: and if you say we shall,</p>
<p>Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.</p>
<p>EMILLIUS Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,</p>
<p>And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,</p>
<p>Lucius, our emperor, for well I know</p>
<p>The common voice do cry it shall be so.</p>
<p>MARCUS Lucius, all hail, Rome’s royal emperor!—</p>
<p>Go, go into old Titus’ sorrowful house,</p>
<p>To Goths</p>
<p>And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,</p>
<p>To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,</p>
<p>As punishment for his most wicked life.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Goths ]</p>
<p>[Lucius and Marcus may descend]</p>
<p>ALL ROMANS Lucius, all hail, to Rome’s gracious governor!</p>
<p>LUCIUS Thanks, gentle Romans. May I govern so</p>
<p>To heal Rome’s harms and wipe away her woe!</p>
<p>But, gentle people, give me aim 1004 awhile,</p>
<p>For nature puts me to a heavy task:</p>
<p>Stand all aloof 1005 , but, uncle, draw you near</p>
<p>To shed obsequious 1006 tears upon this trunk 1007 .—</p>
<p>O, take this warm kiss on thy pale, cold lips,</p>
<p>Kisses Titus</p>
<p>These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stained face,</p>
<p>The last true duties of thy noble son!</p>
<p>MARCUS Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,</p>
<p>Kisses Titus</p>
<p>Thy brother Marcus tenders 1008 on thy lips.</p>
<p>O were the sum of these that I should pay</p>
<p>Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Come hither, boy, come, come, and learn of us</p>
<p>To his son</p>
<p>To melt in showers. Thy grandsire loved thee well:</p>
<p>Many a time he danced thee on his knee,</p>
<p>Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:</p>
<p>Many a matter hath he told to thee,</p>
<p>Meet 1009 and agreeing with thine infancy:</p>
<p>In that respect, then, like a loving child</p>
<p>Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring</p>
<p>Because kind nature doth require it so.</p>
<p>Friends should associate 1010 friends in grief and woe:</p>
<p>Bid him farewell, commit him to the grave,</p>
<p>Do him that kindness and take leave of him.</p>
<p>BOY O grandsire, grandsire, even with all my heart</p>
<p>Kisses Titus</p>
<p>Would I were dead, so you did live again.</p>
<p>O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping,</p>
<p>My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth.</p>
<p>[Enter Aaron guarded by Goths]</p>
<p>A ROMAN You sad Andronici, have done with woes,</p>
<p>Give sentence on this execrable wretch</p>
<p>That hath been breeder of these dire events.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Set him breast-deep in earth and famish 1011 him:</p>
<p>There let him stand and rave and cry for food.</p>
<p>If anyone relieves or pities him,</p>
<p>For the offence he dies. This is our doom 1012 :</p>
<p>Some stay to see him fastened in the earth.</p>
<p>AARON O, why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?</p>
<p>I am no baby, I, that with base prayers</p>
<p>I should repent the evils I have done:</p>
<p>Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did</p>
<p>Would I perform, if I might have my will.</p>
<p>If one good deed in all my life I did</p>
<p>I do repent it from my very soul.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,</p>
<p>And give him burial in his father’s grave:</p>
<p>My father and Lavinia shall forthwith</p>
<p>Be closèd in our household’s monument.</p>
<p>As for that heinous 1013 tiger, Tamora,</p>
<p>No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weeds,</p>
<p>No mournful bell shall ring her burial,</p>
<p>But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:</p>
<p>Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity,</p>
<p>And being so, shall have like want of pity.</p>
<p>{See justice done on Aaron, that damned Moor, }</p>
<p>{From whom our heavy haps 1014 had their beginning: }</p>
<p>{Then afterwards, to order well the state, }</p>
<p>{That like events may ne’er it ruinate.}</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster , and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading ‘bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
