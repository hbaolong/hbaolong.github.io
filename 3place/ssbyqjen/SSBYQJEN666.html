to The Life and Death of King Richard the Second</h4>
<p>How do we measure the worth of our rulers? By the justice of their
claim to power or the quality of their actions at the helm of state?
King Richard II has wasted public funds and is under the influence of
self-serving flatterers. He has arranged the murder of his uncle, Thomas
of Woodstock, a plainspeaking elder statesman who has resisted Richard’s
misrule. Yet he is the rightful king, anointed by God. In the central
scene of Shakespeare’s play, the king is forced to participate in a
ceremony in which he formally removes himself from the throne.
Deposition was a matter so sensitive that this scene was censored out of
the early printed editions of the play, so resonant that the Earl of
Essex and his fellow-conspirators commissioned Shakespeare’s acting
company to put on a special performance of Richard II on the eve of
their rebellion against Queen Elizabeth. Their intention must have been
to use the theatre as a way of preparing the people of London for their
challenge to the monarch.</p>
<p>After the failure of their march on the palace, one of Essex’s men,
Sir Gilly Meyrick, was sentenced to death for, amongst other things,
commissioning this performance. Shakespeare’s company managed to
persuade the Star Chamber that they had only undertaken the performance
for the sake of an extra fee and that they had no involvement in the
real-life plot. They escaped with a reprimand. Though Shakespeare’s
sometime patron the Earl of Southampton marched with Essex, it would be
foolhardy to infer the dramatist’s own loyalties from this incident. To
judge from the choices he made in dramatizing his historical source
materials, he seems to have been more interested in the human story of
Richard’s fall than the politics of rebellion.</p>
<p>It is likely that the Essex faction commissioned the special
performance not so much for its actual content – we cannot be sure that
the deposition was actually staged at this time in the play’s life – as
for the broad association between the rise of Henry Bullingbrook and the
career of the charismatic earl. Essex’s men were probably remembering a
book originally dedicated to their master, Sir John Hayward’s The First
Part of the Life and Reign of King Henry IV . Published in 1599, it had
caused much controversy as a result of its detailed treatment of
Richard’s removal from the throne. The play must, nevertheless, have
been very attractive to Essex and his followers, not only because it
seemed to give good reasons for taking action against an ineffective,
vacillating monarch, but also because it appeared to lament the decline
of chivalric England. One of Essex’s chief strategies during his rise to
prominence at court in the 1590s was to portray himself as a hero from a
nobler age that had gone. He invoked the code of ‘honour’ and made
himself synonymous with such displays as the Accession Day tilts, in
which courtiers would joust like knights of old.</p>
<p>The beginning of the play, so redolent of the medieval ‘rites of
knighthood’, would have been very much to Essex’s taste. Mowbray and
Bullingbrook throw down their gages and prepare for single combat with
sword and lance. They are concerned above all with ‘spotless
reputation’: ‘Mine honour is my life; both grow in one’, says Mowbray,
‘Take honour from me, and my life is done.’ Honour is seen as the
hallmark of the ‘trueborn Englishman’. The feuding dukes regard
themselves as true patriots, appealing to ‘English earth’ and lamenting
that in exile they must forgo their ‘native English’ language. Richard’s
native language, by contrast, was French (which was also the nationality
of his wife) and his court is implicitly seen as a place of French
affectation. King Richard stands accused of wasting the patrimony of the
English nation. He has been fleeced by his flatterers and costly Irish
wars have required him to ‘lease out’ the land. Given that Queen
Elizabeth’s exchequer was also heavily overdrawn as a result of the
Irish problem, Shakespeare was probably being diplomatic as well as
practical in not attempting to stage Richard’s military campaign in
Ireland, which is described at great length in his source, Holinshed’s
Chronicles . The focus remains firmly on the English land, imagined
metaphorically as a sea-walled garden ‘full of weeds, her fairest
flowers choked up’. Within two years of the play appearing in print,
John of Gaunt’s ‘this sceptred isle’ speech was ripped from its context
and included in an anthology called England’s Parnassus as an exemplar
of patriotic writing. It appears there as an unfinished sentence,
lacking the sting in the tail: ‘this England … Is now leased out … That
England, that was wont to conquer others, / Hath made a shameful
conquest of itself.’ True patriotism, the original context reveals,
involves fierce criticism of bad government as well as rhetorical praise
of the land.</p>
<p>But if the bad governor is sacredly endowed as God’s anointed deputy
on earth, then is it permissible to remove him, even in the name of
England and ‘true chivalry’? If the king is synonymous with the law,
then to turn the law against him may seem a contradiction in terms, as
the Bishop of Carlisle recognizes: ‘What subject can give sentence on
his king?’ The monarch was traditionally imagined to have two bodies: as
body politic, the king was incarnation of the nation; as body natural,
he was a mortal like anyone else. This was what made possible the
paradoxical words ‘The king is dead, long live the king.’ When Richard
stages his own unthroning, he inverts the words of the coronation
service, shatters a mirror and gives up one of his two bodies.</p>
<p>What is left for the private self when the public persona is stripped
away? Without ‘honour’, according to the contentious dukes, ‘Men are but
gilded loam or painted clay.’ But what would a king be without his
crown, without a name and a title? Once Richard has broken the mirror,
he turns from his image to his inner self. Whereas monarchy depends on
exterior show, inwardness is explored through the medium of words.
Richard is by far the most inward-looking of Shakespeare’s kings. By
focusing on the individual consciousness, considering Richard’s fate in
psychological terms, Shakespeare neatly sidesteps the alarmingly
destabilizing political consequences of the moment when a subject gives
sentence on a king. ‘I had forgot myself. Am I not king?’ In the very
act of asking this question, Richard reveals that the answer is ‘no’:
since a king has two bodies, he has the right to speak in the royal
‘we’, but here Richard is no more than an ‘I’. In speaking of himself he
veers between ‘I’, ‘we’ and ‘he’ (‘What must the king do now? Must he
submit?’). Inconsistent pronouns are the surest sign of the instability
of his self.</p>
<p>Soliloquy and rhetorical elaboration are forms of self-dramatization.
Richard sustains himself through a bravura linguistic performance:
‘Let’s talk of graves …’ He makes himself the object of his subjective
musings: ‘Must he lose the name of king?’ He watches himself losing his
grip on his role: ‘Ay, no; no, ay, for I must nothing be.’ And he
becomes more and more aware that to be is also to act, that we are all
role-players: ‘Thus play I in one prison many people, / And none
contented’ (‘one prison’ is the Folio text’s interesting variant on the
original Quarto’s ‘one person’– ‘prison’ nicely suggests both Richard’s
confined location and the traditional idea of the body as prison of the
soul, which is then released to eternity in death). He leaves the stage
in the manner of ‘a well-graced actor’.</p>
<p>Though the Folio text is entitled The Life and Death of King Richard
the Second , the earlier Quarto edition was called The Tragedy of King
Richard the Second . The structure of the drama answers to a very
traditional idea of tragedy as a story in which a powerful figure falls
from earthly prosperity and in so doing rises to greatness of soul. Pity
for Richard is the prevailing tragic emotion in the closing scenes. ‘It
seems to be the design of the poet to raise Richard to esteem in his
fall, and consequently to interest the reader in his favour’, wrote Dr
Johnson. Note ‘the reader’ there, not the spectator – this is a play
that has been more admired on page than stage. Johnson continues: ‘He
gives him only passive fortitude, the virtue of a confessor, rather than
of a king. In his prosperity we saw him imperious and oppressive; but in
his distress he is wise, patient, and pious.’</p>
<p>By concentrating on the inner life of Richard, Shakespeare diminishes
some of the major elements of the play that was his structural model,
Christopher Marlowe’s Edward II . The flatterers Bushy, Bagot and Green
are given very small roles and the exclusion of the queen from the
king’s affections is not fully developed. In Marlowe’s dramatization of
the fall of a weak king and the rise of his rival, the minions – first
Gaveston and then Spencer – are central not only to the politics but
also to the sexuality of the play. They are explicitly the king’s
lovers. The abused queen becomes a lead player in the rebellion against
the king. Shakespeare’s Richard by contrast seems too self-absorbed to
be powerfully driven by sexual desire. Samuel Taylor Coleridge spoke
intriguingly of the character’s feminine friendism , but that is not
quite a euphemism for homoerotic feeling.</p>
<p>As the man who rises when Richard falls, Bullingbrook’s story remains
unfinished. But Shakespeare anticipates the civil war that will wrack
his reign. The role of Northumberland, who co-operates with Bullingbrook
but will eventually turn against him, is greatly expanded from its seed
in Holinshed’s Chronicles . Richard delivers a prophecy that ‘The time
shall not be many hours of age / More than it is ere foul sin, gathering
head, / Shall break into corruption’ and predicts rightly that
Northumberland will seek to pluck King Henry IV from his usurped throne.
As he wrote these words, Shakespeare must have been thinking of how he
was going to continue the story in another play.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: In the presence of King Richard, Henry Bullingbrook accuses
Thomas Mowbray of embezzling crown funds and of plotting the death of
his uncle, the Duke of Gloucester. They will not be reconciled and are
about to fight, but Richard stops the combat before it can begin.
Bullingbrook is exiled for ten years (later reduced to six); Mowbray is
exiled for life. John of Gaunt (Duke of Lancaster, uncle to the king and
father to Bullingbrook) dies after accusing Richard of improper
government. Richard orders the seizure of Gaunt’s property, thus denying
Bullingbrook his inheritance. He then departs for Ireland, appointing
his other uncle York to govern in his absence. Northumberland reveals
that Bullingbrook has returned to England with an army. Bullingbrook
persuades his uncle York that he has returned for his rightful
inheritance, not to start a rebellion against the crown. Richard returns
from Ireland to discover that his Welsh troops have deserted him, that
York has allied himself with Bullingbrook, and that the common people
are rising against him. Bullingbrook and his supporters meet with
Richard. Bullingbrook promises to surrender his arms if his banishment
is repealed and his inheritance restored. Richard agrees to his demands.
Richard’s cousin Aumerle is accused of murdering the Duke of Gloucester.
Bullingbrook arrests everyone involved in the allegations. Richard
agrees to abdicate. Bullingbrook announces his coronation. A plot is
hatched to restore Richard to the throne. York discovers that his son
Aumerle is involved in a plot to kill Bullingbrook. Aumerle confesses to
Bullingbrook, and is pardoned. Richard is killed whilst imprisoned in
Pomfret Castle. Bullingbrook receives news of his supporters’ efforts to
defeat his detractors. Exton presents Richard’s body to Bullingbrook,
only to be rewarded with banishment. Bullingbrook promises to undertake
a pilgrimage to expiate his sins.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) King Richard II (27％/98/9), Henry Bullingbrook (15％/90/8),
Duke of York (10％/54/8), John of Gaunt (7％/28/4), Northumberland
(5％/38/6), Mowbray (5％/13/2), Queen (4％/25/4), Aumerle (3％/38/7),
Duchess of York (3％/28/2), Bishop of Carlisle (2％/6/2), Duchess of
Gloucester (2％/4/1), Gardener (2％/6/1).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 100％ verse, with high proportion of rhyme.</p>
<p>DATE: 1595–96. Registered for publication August 1597. Written after
Samuel Daniel’s First Four Books of the Civil Wars (registered October
1594, apparently published 1595); perhaps post-dates renowned Accession
Day tilts of November 1595. Described in February 1601 as ‘old and long
out of use’.</p>
<p>SOURCES: primary source is the account of the last two years of
Richard’s reign in Raphael Holinshed’s Chronicles (1587 edition),
supplemented – especially for various details in the final act – by
Samuel Daniel’s First Four Books of the Civil Wars between the two
Houses of Lancaster and York (1594–95). Christopher Marlowe’s Edward II
(1592?) was a major dramatic influence, both structurally (the fall of a
weak king and the rise of his rival) and thematically (flatterers, Irish
wars, a marginalized queen). Some scholars also detect the influence of
the anonymous chronicle play of Woodstock : as well as verbal parallels,
there are resemblances between Shakespeare’s John of Gaunt and this
play’s Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, but recent scholarship
suggests that Shakespeare’s play precedes Woodstock , not vice versa.
The garden scene is apparently without source, though the comparison
between a disordered state and an overgrown garden was traditional.</p>
<p>TEXT: First printed in Quarto in 1597, with text deriving from
Shakespeare’s working manuscript or a transcription of it; the
deposition scene was, however, omitted for reasons of censorship. The
First Quarto was reprinted several times (Second and Third Quartos,
1598; Fourth Quarto, 1608; Fifth Quarto, 1615). These later Quartos
correct a few obvious errors in the First Quarto, but introduce many
misprints. The Second Quarto was one of the first printed play texts to
include Shakespeare’s name on the title page. The Fourth Quarto printed
the deposition sequence for the first time, but in a defective text. The
Folio text seems to have been printed from the Third Quarto (though a
few editors argue that it was based on either the Fifth Quarto or a
defective copy of the Third Quarto with the missing final leaves made up
from the Fifth Quarto), but the Folio editor also consulted a manuscript
closely related to theatrical production, perhaps the company
‘playbook’. The Folio restored many First Quarto readings that had been
corrupted in later Quartos, printed a good text of the deposition scene
for the first time, added and systematized stage directions, made some
alterations to staging for the sake of clarification, introduced act
divisions, replaced ‘God’ with ‘heaven’ in accordance with the 1606 Act
to restrain Abuses, made a few verbal alterations, and omitted about
fifty lines (these mostly seem to be deliberate theatrical cuts, though
a clutch of individual lines might have been dropped inadvertently).
Most modern editions are based on the First Quarto, with the deposition
scene, stage directions and many individual readings taken from the
Folio. Our text resists this sort of conflation and is based on Folio,
with the correction of manifest printers’ errors. The Quarto-only
passages are given at the end of the play.</p>
