<h4 id="scene-1-767-running-scene-7">Scene 1 767 / running scene 7</h4>
<p>The trumpets sound. Enter young Prince [Edward ], the Dukes of
Gloucester [Richard ] and Buckingham, Lord Cardinal with others</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber 768
.</p>
<p>RICHARD Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts’ sovereign 769 .</p>
<p>The weary way hath made you melancholy.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD No, uncle, but our crosses 770 on the way</p>
<p>Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy 771 .</p>
<p>I want 772 more uncles here to welcome me.</p>
<p>RICHARD Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years</p>
<p>Hath not yet dived into the world’s deceit.</p>
<p>No more can you distinguish of a man</p>
<p>Than of his outward show, which — God he knows —</p>
<p>Seldom or never jumpeth 773 with the heart.</p>
<p>Those uncles which you want were dangerous:</p>
<p>Your grace attended 774 to their sugared words,</p>
<p>But looked not on the poison of their hearts.</p>
<p>God keep you from them, and from such false friends.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD God keep me from false friends, but they were none.</p>
<p>RICHARD My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet you.</p>
<p>Enter Lord Mayor</p>
<p>LORD MAYOR God bless your grace with health and happy days.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.—</p>
<p>I thought my mother, and my brother York,</p>
<p>Would long ere 775 this have met us on the way.</p>
<p>Fie, what a slug 776 is Hastings, that he comes not</p>
<p>To tell us whether they will come or no.</p>
<p>Enter Lord Hastings</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?</p>
<p>HASTINGS On what occasion 777 , God he knows, not I,</p>
<p>The queen your mother, and your brother York,</p>
<p>Have taken sanctuary. The tender 778 prince 779</p>
<p>Would fain 780 have come with me to meet your grace,</p>
<p>But by his mother was perforce 781 withheld.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Fie, what an indirect 782 and peevish 783 course</p>
<p>Is this of hers?— Lord Cardinal, will your grace</p>
<p>Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York</p>
<p>Unto his princely brother presently 784 ?—</p>
<p>If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,</p>
<p>And from her jealous 785 arms pluck him perforce.</p>
<p>CARDINAL My lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory 786</p>
<p>Can from his mother win the Duke of York,</p>
<p>Anon 787 expect him here. But if she be obdurate 788</p>
<p>To mild entreaties, God forbid</p>
<p>We should infringe the holy privilege</p>
<p>Of blessèd sanctuary. Not for all this land</p>
<p>Would I be guilty of so great a sin.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM You are too senseless 789 obstinate, my lord,</p>
<p>Too ceremonious and traditional.</p>
<p>Weigh it but with 790 the grossness 791 of this age,</p>
<p>You break not sanctuary in seizing him.</p>
<p>The benefit 792 thereof is always granted</p>
<p>To those whose dealings 793 have deserved the place,</p>
<p>And those who have the wit 794 to claim the place:</p>
<p>This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it,</p>
<p>And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.</p>
<p>Then, taking him from thence that is not there 795 ,</p>
<p>You break no privilege nor charter 796 there.</p>
<p>Oft have I heard of sanctuary men,</p>
<p>But sanctuary children ne’er till now.</p>
<p>CARDINAL My lord, you shall o’er-rule my mind for once.—</p>
<p>Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?</p>
<p>HASTINGS I go, my lord.</p>
<p>Exeunt Cardinal and Hastings</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.—</p>
<p>Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,</p>
<p>Where shall we sojourn 797 till our coronation?</p>
<p>RICHARD Where it think’st best unto your royal self.</p>
<p>If I may counsel you, some day or two</p>
<p>Your highness shall repose you 798 at the Tower 799 :</p>
<p>Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit</p>
<p>For your best health and recreation.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD I do not like the Tower, of any place 800 .—</p>
<p>Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?</p>
<p>To Buckingham</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,</p>
<p>Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified 801 .</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD Is it upon record 802 ? Or else reported</p>
<p>Successively from age to age, he built it?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Upon record, my gracious lord.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD But say, my lord, it were not registered 803 ,</p>
<p>Methinks the truth should live from age to age,</p>
<p>As ’twere retailed 804 to all posterity,</p>
<p>Even to the general ending day 805 .</p>
<p>RICHARD So wise so young, they say, do never live long 806 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD What say you, uncle?</p>
<p>RICHARD I say, without characters 807 , fame lives long.—</p>
<p>Thus, like the formal Vice 808 , Iniquity 809 ,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>I moralize 810 two meanings in one word.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD That Julius Caesar was a famous man.</p>
<p>With what his valour did enrich his wit,</p>
<p>His wit set down to make his valour live 811 .</p>
<p>Death makes no conquest of his conqueror 812 ,</p>
<p>For now he lives in fame, though not in life.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham—</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM What, my gracious lord?</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD An if 813 I live until I be a man,</p>
<p>I’ll win our ancient right in France again,</p>
<p>Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.</p>
<p>RICHARD Short summers lightly 814 have a forward 815 spring.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Enter young York, Hastings and Cardinal</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD Richard of York, how fares our noble brother?</p>
<p>YORK Well, my dear lord, so must I call you now.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD Ay, brother, to our grief 816 , as it is yours:</p>
<p>Too late 817 he died that might have kept that title,</p>
<p>Which by his death hath lost much majesty.</p>
<p>RICHARD How fares our cousin, noble lord of York?</p>
<p>YORK I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,</p>
<p>You said that idle 818 weeds are fast in growth:</p>
<p>The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.</p>
<p>RICHARD He hath, my lord.</p>
<p>YORK And therefore is he idle?</p>
<p>RICHARD O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.</p>
<p>YORK Then he is more beholding 819 to you than I.</p>
<p>RICHARD He may command me as my sovereign,</p>
<p>But you have power in me as in 820 a kinsman.</p>
<p>YORK I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger 821 .</p>
<p>RICHARD My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart 822 .</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD A beggar, brother?</p>
<p>YORK Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,</p>
<p>And being but a toy 823 , which is no grief 824 to give.</p>
<p>RICHARD A greater gift than that I’ll give my cousin.</p>
<p>YORK A greater gift? O, that’s the sword to it 825 .</p>
<p>RICHARD Ay, gentle cousin, were it light 826 enough.</p>
<p>YORK O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts.</p>
<p>In weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay 827 .</p>
<p>RICHARD It is too weighty for your grace to wear.</p>
<p>YORK I weigh it lightly 828 , were it 829 heavier.</p>
<p>RICHARD What, would you have 830 my weapon, little lord?</p>
<p>YORK I would, that I might thank you as you call me.</p>
<p>RICHARD How?</p>
<p>YORK Little.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD My lord of York will still 831 be cross 832 in
talk.</p>
<p>Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.</p>
<p>YORK You mean to bear me, not to bear with me.—</p>
<p>Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me,</p>
<p>Because that I am little, like an ape,</p>
<p>He thinks that you should bear 833 me on your shoulders 834 .</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM With what a sharp-provided 835 wit he reasons!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>To mitigate 836 the scorn he gives his uncle,</p>
<p>He prettily 837 and aptly taunts himself.</p>
<p>So cunning 838 and so young is wonderful.</p>
<p>RICHARD My lord, will’t please you pass along?</p>
<p>Myself and my good cousin Buckingham</p>
<p>Will to your mother, to entreat of her</p>
<p>To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.</p>
<p>YORK What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD My Lord Protector will have it so.</p>
<p>YORK I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.</p>
<p>RICHARD Why, what should you fear?</p>
<p>YORK Marry, my uncle Clarence’ angry ghost.</p>
<p>My grandam told me he was murdered there.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD I fear no uncles dead.</p>
<p>RICHARD Nor none that live, I hope.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD An if they live, I hope I need not fear.</p>
<p>But come, my lord and with a heavy heart,</p>
<p>Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.</p>
<p>A sennet 839 .</p>
<p>Exeunt Prince, York, Hastings and Dorset. Richard, Buckingham and
Catesby remain</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Think you, my lord, this little prating 840 York</p>
<p>Was not incensèd 841 by his subtle 842 mother</p>
<p>To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously 843 ?</p>
<p>RICHARD No doubt, no doubt. O, ’tis a perilous 844 boy:</p>
<p>Bold, quick, ingenious, forward 845 , capable 846 .</p>
<p>He is all the mother’s 847 , from the top to toe.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Well, let them rest 848 .— Come hither, Catesby.</p>
<p>Thou art sworn as deeply 849 to effect what we intend</p>
<p>As closely 850 to conceal what we impart.</p>
<p>Thou know’st our reasons urged 851 upon the way 852 ,</p>
<p>What think’st thou? Is it not an easy matter</p>
<p>To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,</p>
<p>For 853 the instalment of this noble duke</p>
<p>In the seat royal of this famous isle?</p>
<p>CATESBY He for his father’s 854 sake so loves the prince,</p>
<p>That he will not be won to aught 855 against him.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM What think’st thou, then, of Stanley? Will not he?</p>
<p>CATESBY He will do all in all as Hastings doth.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,</p>
<p>And, as it were far off 856 sound 857 thou Lord Hastings,</p>
<p>How he doth stand affected 858 to our purpose,</p>
<p>And summon him tomorrow to the Tower,</p>
<p>To sit 859 about the coronation.</p>
<p>If thou dost find him tractable to us,</p>
<p>Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons.</p>
<p>If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,</p>
<p>Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,</p>
<p>And give us notice of his inclination,</p>
<p>For we tomorrow hold divided councils 860 ,</p>
<p>Wherein thyself shalt highly 861 be employed.</p>
<p>RICHARD Commend me to Lord William 862 . Tell him, Catesby,</p>
<p>His ancient knot 863 of dangerous adversaries</p>
<p>Tomorrow are let blood 864 at Pomfret Castle,</p>
<p>And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,</p>
<p>Give Mistress Shore 865 one gentle kiss the more.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.</p>
<p>CATESBY My good lords both, with all the heed 866 I can.</p>
<p>RICHARD Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?</p>
<p>CATESBY You shall, my lord.</p>
<p>RICHARD At Crosby House, there shall you find us both.</p>
<p>Exit Catesby</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Now my lord, what shall we do if we perceive</p>
<p>Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots 867 ?</p>
<p>RICHARD Chop off his head: something we will determine:</p>
<p>And look when I am king, claim thou of me</p>
<p>The earldom of Hereford, and all the movables 868</p>
<p>Whereof the king my brother was possessed.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM I’ll claim that promise at your grace’s hand.</p>
<p>RICHARD And look to have it yielded with all kindness.</p>
<p>Come, let us sup betimes 869 , that afterwards</p>
<p>We may digest 870 our complots in some form 871 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
