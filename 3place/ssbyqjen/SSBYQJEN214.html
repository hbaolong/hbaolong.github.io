<h4 id="scene-4-running-scene-12">Scene 4 ／ running scene 12</h4>
<p>Enter Duke Senior, Amiens, Jaques, Orlando, Oliver, Celia</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy</p>
<p>Can do all this that he hath promisèd?</p>
<p>ORLANDO I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not,</p>
<p>As those that fear they hope and know they fear.</p>
<p>Enter Rosalind, Silvius and Phoebe</p>
<p>ROSALIND Patience once more, whiles our compact 1146 is urged 1147
:</p>
<p>You say, if I bring in your Rosalind, you will bestow her on Orlando
here?</p>
<p>To Duke Senior</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.</p>
<p>ROSALIND And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?</p>
<p>To Orlando</p>
<p>ORLANDO That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.</p>
<p>ROSALIND You say, you’ll marry me, if I be willing?</p>
<p>To Phoebe</p>
<p>PHOEBE That will I, should I die the hour after.</p>
<p>ROSALIND But if you do refuse to marry me,</p>
<p>You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?</p>
<p>PHOEBE So is the bargain.</p>
<p>ROSALIND You say, that you’ll have Phoebe, if she will?</p>
<p>To Silvius</p>
<p>SILVIUS Though to have her and death were both one thing.</p>
<p>ROSALIND I have promised to make all this matter even 1148 .</p>
<p>Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter,</p>
<p>You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter.</p>
<p>Keep you your word, Phoebe, that you’ll marry me,</p>
<p>Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd.</p>
<p>Keep your word, Silvius, that you’ll marry her</p>
<p>If she refuse me. And from hence I go,</p>
<p>To make these doubts all even.</p>
<p>Exeunt Rosalind and Celia</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR I do remember in this shepherd boy</p>
<p>Some lively 1149 touches 1150 of my daughter’s favour 1151 .</p>
<p>ORLANDO My lord, the first time that I ever saw him</p>
<p>Methought he was a brother to your daughter:</p>
<p>But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,</p>
<p>And hath been tutored in the rudiments 1152</p>
<p>Of many desperate 1153 studies by his uncle,</p>
<p>Whom he reports to be a great magician,</p>
<p>Enter Clown [Touchstone ] and Audrey</p>
<p>Obscurèd 1154 in the circle 1155 of this forest.</p>
<p>JAQUES There is, sure, another flood toward 1156 , and these couples
are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts, which
in all tongues 1157 are called fools.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Salutation and greeting to you all!</p>
<p>JAQUES Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the motley-minded 1158
gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a
courtier, he swears.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation 1159
. I have trod a measure 1160 , I have flattered a lady, I have been
politic 1161 with my friend, smooth 1162 with mine enemy, I have undone
1163 three tailors, I have had four quarrels, and like to have 1164
fought one.</p>
<p>JAQUES And how was that ta’en up 1165 ?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh
cause.</p>
<p>JAQUES How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR I like him very well.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE God ’ild 1166 you, sir, I desire you of the like 1167 . I
press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives 1168 ,
to swear and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks
1169 . A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own, a
poor humour 1170 of mine, sir, to take that that no man else will. Rich
honesty 1171 dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in
your foul 1172 oyster.</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR By my faith, he is very swift 1173 and sententious 1174
.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE According to the fool’s bolt 1175 , sir, and such dulcet
diseases 1176 .</p>
<p>JAQUES But, for the seventh cause. How did you find the quarrel on
the seventh cause?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Upon a lie seven times removed — bear your body more
seeming 1177 , Audrey — as 1178 thus, sir: I did dislike the cut of a
certain courtier’s beard. He sent me word, if I said his beard was not
cut well, he was in the mind 1179 it was: this is called the Retort
Courteous. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send
me word, he cut it to please himself: this is called the Quip Modest. If
again it was not well cut, he disabled 1180 my judgement: this is called
the Reply Churlish. If again it was not well cut, he would answer, I
spake not true: this is called the Reproof Valiant. If again it was not
well cut, he would say I lied: this is called the Countercheck 1181
Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie Circumstantial 1182 and the Lie
Direct.</p>
<p>JAQUES And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor he
durst not give me the Lie Direct, and so we measured swords 1183 and
parted.</p>
<p>JAQUES Can you nominate 1184 in order now the degrees of the lie?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE O sir, we quarrel in print 1185 , by the book, as you have
books for good manners. I will name you the degrees: The first, the
Retort Courteous: the second, the Quip Modest: the third, the Reply
Churlish: the fourth, the Reproof Valiant: the fifth, the Countercheck
Quarrelsome: the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance: the seventh, the Lie
Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie Direct, and you may avoid
that too, with an ‘if’. I knew when seven justices could not take up
1186 a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them
thought but of an ‘if’, as, ‘If you said so, then I said so’, and they
shook hands and swore brothers 1187 . Your ‘if’ is the only peacemaker.
Much virtue in ‘if’.</p>
<p>JAQUES Is not this a rare 1188 fellow, my lord? He’s as good at
anything and yet a fool.</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR He uses his folly like a stalking-horse 1189 and under
the presentation 1190 of that he shoots his wit.</p>
<p>Enter Hymen 1191 , Rosalind and Celia. Still 1192 music</p>
<p>HYMEN Then is there mirth 1193 in heaven,</p>
<p>When earthly things made even 1194</p>
<p>Atone 1195 together.</p>
<p>Good duke, receive thy daughter,</p>
<p>Hymen from heaven brought her,</p>
<p>Yea, brought her hither,</p>
<p>That thou mightst join her hand with his</p>
<p>Whose heart within his bosom is.</p>
<p>ROSALIND To you I give myself, for I am yours.—</p>
<p>To Duke Senior</p>
<p>To you I give myself, for I am yours.</p>
<p>To Orlando</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.</p>
<p>ORLANDO If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.</p>
<p>PHOEBE If sight and shape 1196 be true,</p>
<p>Why then, my love adieu!</p>
<p>ROSALIND I’ll have no father, if you be not he.—</p>
<p>To Duke Senior</p>
<p>I’ll have no husband, if you be not he.—</p>
<p>To Orlando</p>
<p>Nor ne’er wed woman, if you be not she.</p>
<p>To Phoebe</p>
<p>HYMEN Peace, ho! I bar 1197 confusion:</p>
<p>’Tis I must make conclusion</p>
<p>Of these most strange events.</p>
<p>Here’s eight that must take hands</p>
<p>To join in Hymen’s bands 1198 ,</p>
<p>If truth holds true contents.—</p>
<p>You and you no cross 1199 shall part;—</p>
<p>To Orlando and Rosalind</p>
<p>You and you are heart in heart.—</p>
<p>To Oliver and Celia</p>
<p>You to his love must accord 1200 ,</p>
<p>To Phoebe</p>
<p>Or have a woman to your lord 1201 .—</p>
<p>You and you are sure 1202 together,</p>
<p>To Touchstone and Audrey</p>
<p>As the winter to foul weather.—</p>
<p>Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,</p>
<p>Feed yourselves with questioning 1203 ,</p>
<p>That reason wonder may diminish</p>
<p>How thus we met, and these things finish.</p>
<p>Song</p>
<p>Wedding is great Juno 1204 ’s crown,</p>
<p>O, blessèd bond of board and bed 1205 !</p>
<p>’Tis Hymen peoples 1206 every town,</p>
<p>High wedlock then be honourèd:</p>
<p>Honour, high honour and renown,</p>
<p>To Hymen, god of every town!</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR O my dear niece, welcome thou 1207 art to me!</p>
<p>To Celia</p>
<p>Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.</p>
<p>PHOEBE I will not eat my word, now thou art mine,</p>
<p>To Silvius</p>
<p>Thy faith my fancy 1208 to thee doth combine 1209 .</p>
<p>Enter Second Brother [Jaques de Bois ]</p>
<p>JAQUES DE BOIS Let me have audience for a word or two:</p>
<p>I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,</p>
<p>That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.</p>
<p>Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day</p>
<p>Men of great worth resorted to this forest,</p>
<p>Addressed 1210 a mighty power 1211 , which were on foot,</p>
<p>In his own conduct 1212 , purposely to take</p>
<p>His brother here and put him to the sword:</p>
<p>And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;</p>
<p>Where, meeting with an old religious man,</p>
<p>After some question with him, was converted</p>
<p>Both from his enterprise and from the world 1213 ,</p>
<p>His crown bequeathing to his banished brother,</p>
<p>And all their lands restored to them again</p>
<p>That were with him exiled. This to be true,</p>
<p>I do engage 1214 my life.</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR Welcome, young man.</p>
<p>Thou offer’st fairly 1215 to thy brothers’ wedding:</p>
<p>To one his lands withheld, and to the other</p>
<p>A land itself at large 1216 , a potent dukedom.</p>
<p>First, in this forest, let us do those ends 1217</p>
<p>That here were well begun and well begot:</p>
<p>And after, every 1218 of this happy number</p>
<p>That have endured shrewd 1219 days and nights with us</p>
<p>Shall share the good of our returnèd fortune,</p>
<p>According to the measure of their states 1220 .</p>
<p>Meantime, forget this new-fall’n 1221 dignity</p>
<p>And fall into our rustic revelry.</p>
<p>Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,</p>
<p>With measure heaped in joy 1222 , to th’measures 1223 fall.</p>
<p>JAQUES Sir, by your patience 1224 . If I heard you rightly,</p>
<p>The duke hath put on a religious life</p>
<p>And thrown into neglect the pompous 1225 court?</p>
<p>JAQUES DE BOIS He hath.</p>
<p>JAQUES To him will I: out of these convertites 1226</p>
<p>There is much matter to be heard and learned.—</p>
<p>You to your former honour I bequeath,</p>
<p>To Duke Senior</p>
<p>Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.—</p>
<p>You to a love that your true faith doth merit.—</p>
<p>To Orlando</p>
<p>You to your land and love and great allies 1227 .—</p>
<p>To Oliver</p>
<p>You to a long and well-deservèd bed.—</p>
<p>To Silvius</p>
<p>And you to wrangling, for thy loving voyage</p>
<p>To Touchstone</p>
<p>Is but for two months victualled 1228 . So, to your pleasures.</p>
<p>I am for other than for dancing measures.</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR Stay, Jaques, stay.</p>
<p>JAQUES To see no pastime, I. What you would have</p>
<p>I’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR Proceed, proceed.— We’ll begin these rites,</p>
<p>As we do trust they’ll end, in true delights.</p>
<p>They dance</p>
<p>[Exeunt all but Rosalind ]</p>
<p>ROSALIND It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue, but it
is no more unhandsome 1229 than to see the lord the prologue. If it be
true that good wine needs no bush 1230 , ’tis true that a good play
needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes, and good
plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a case 1231
am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
1232 you in the behalf of a good play! I am not furnished 1233 like a
beggar, therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure 1234
you, and I’ll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love
you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you. And I
charge you, O men, for the love you bear to women — as I perceive by
your simpering, none of you hates them — that between you and the women
the play 1235 may please. If I were a woman 1236 , I would kiss as many
of you as had beards that pleased me, complexions that liked 1237 me and
breaths that I defied 1238 not. And I am sure, as many as have good
beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my kind offer, when I
make curtsy, bid me farewell 1239 .</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header - our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster , and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268-81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address - it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ‘bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading ‘bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information - for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
<p>“This new Complete Works from the RSC is a glorious edition of one of
the world’s most important books. It’s the essential reference book for
anyone who’s ever been in love, felt jealousy, fear, hatred, or desire.
All human life is here - and every home should have one.“</p>
<p>—— Dame Judi Dench</p>

<p>——朱迪·丹奇女爵士</p>
<p>“Thanks to Bate and Rasmussen, we now have a rendering of the
Complete Works that, in a rare publishing achievement, would also give
