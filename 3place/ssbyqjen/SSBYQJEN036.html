<h4 id="scene-4-running-scene-16">Scene 4 ／ running scene 16</h4>
<p>Enter Lance [with his dog, Crab ]</p>
<p>LANCE When a man’s servant shall play the cur 890 with him, look you,
it goes hard 891 : one that I brought up of 892 a puppy: one that I
saved from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and
sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
‘thus I would teach a dog’. I was sent to deliver him as a present to
Mistress Silvia from my master, and I came no sooner into the
dining-chamber but he steps me 893 to her trencher 894 and steals her
capon’s 895 leg: O, ‘tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep 896 himself
in all companies. I would have, as one should say, one that takes upon
him 897 to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at 898 all things.
If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did
899 , I think verily 900 he had 901 been hanged for’t: sure as I live,
he had suffered for’t, you shall judge. He thrusts me 902 himself into
the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the duke’s table:
he had not been there — bless the mark 903 — a pissing while 904 , but
all the chamber smelt him. ’Out with the dog!’ says one. ‘What cur is
that?’ says another. ‘Whip him out’, says the third. ‘Hang him up’, says
the duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was
Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs: ‘Friend,’ quoth I,
‘you mean to whip the dog?’ ‘Ay, marry, do I’, quoth he. ‘You do him the
more wrong,’ quoth I, ‘’twas I did the thing you wot of 905 .’ He makes
me no more ado 906 , but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters
would do this for his servant? Nay, I’ll be sworn, I have sat in the
stocks 907 for puddings 908 he hath stolen, otherwise he had been
executed: I have stood on the pillory 909 for geese he hath killed,
otherwise he had suffered for’t.— Thou think’st not of this now. Nay, I
remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia:
did not I bid thee still mark 910 me and do as I do? When didst thou see
me heave up 911 my leg and make water 912 against a gentlewoman’s
farthingale? Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?</p>
<p>To Crab</p>
<p>[Enter Proteus, and Julia disguised as Sebastian ]</p>
<p>PROTEUS Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well and will employ thee
in some service presently.</p>
<p>To Julia</p>
<p>JULIA In what you please, I’ll do what I can.</p>
<p>PROTEUS I hope thou wilt.— How now, you whoreson peasant, where have
you been these two days loitering?</p>
<p>To Lance</p>
<p>LANCE Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.</p>
<p>PROTEUS And what says she to my little jewel 913 ?</p>
<p>LANCE Marry, she says your dog was a cur 914 , and tells you currish
915 thanks is good enough for such a present.</p>
<p>PROTEUS But she received my dog?</p>
<p>LANCE No indeed did she not: here have I brought him back again.</p>
<p>PROTEUS What, didst thou offer her this from me?</p>
<p>Points to Crab</p>
<p>LANCE Ay, sir: the other squirrel 916 was stolen from me by the
hangman boys 917 in the market-place, and then I offered her mine own,
who is a dog as big as ten of yours, and therefore the gift the
greater.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,</p>
<p>Or ne’er return again into my sight.</p>
<p>Away, I say: stay’st thou to vex me here?</p>
<p>[Exit Lance with Crab ]</p>
<p>A slave, that still an end 918 turns me to shame.</p>
<p>Sebastian, I have entertained 919 thee,</p>
<p>Partly that I have need of such a youth</p>
<p>That can with some discretion do my business,</p>
<p>For ’tis no trusting to yond 920 foolish lout,</p>
<p>But chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour 921 ,</p>
<p>Which, if my augury 922 deceive me not,</p>
<p>Witness 923 good bringing up, fortune and truth:</p>
<p>Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.</p>
<p>Go presently, and take this ring with thee,</p>
<p>Gives a ring</p>
<p>Deliver it to Madam Silvia;</p>
<p>She loved me well delivered 924 it to me.</p>
<p>JULIA It seems you loved not her, to leave 925 her token:</p>
<p>She is dead, belike?</p>
<p>PROTEUS Not so: I think she lives.</p>
<p>JULIA Alas!</p>
<p>PROTEUS Why dost thou cry ‘Alas’?</p>
<p>JULIA I cannot choose but pity her.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?</p>
<p>JULIA Because methinks that she loved you as well</p>
<p>As you do love your lady Silvia:</p>
<p>She dreams on him that has forgot her love,</p>
<p>You dote on her that cares not for your love.</p>
<p>’Tis pity love should be so contrary:</p>
<p>And thinking on it makes me cry ‘Alas’.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Well, give her that ring and therewithal 926</p>
<p>This letter. That’s her chamber. Tell my lady</p>
<p>Gives a letter</p>
<p>I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.</p>
<p>Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,</p>
<p>Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>JULIA How many women would do such a message?</p>
<p>Alas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertained</p>
<p>A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.</p>
<p>Alas, poor fool 927 , why do I pity him</p>
<p>That with his very heart despiseth me?</p>
<p>Because he loves her, he despiseth me:</p>
<p>Because I love him, I must pity him.</p>
<p>This ring I gave him when he parted from me,</p>
<p>To bind him to remember my good will.</p>
<p>And now am I, unhappy messenger,</p>
<p>To plead for that which I would not obtain 928 ,</p>
<p>To carry that which I would have refused,</p>
<p>To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.</p>
<p>I am my master’s true-confirmèd 929 love,</p>
<p>But cannot be true servant to my master,</p>
<p>Unless I prove false traitor to myself.</p>
<p>Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly</p>
<p>As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed 930 .</p>
<p>[Enter Silvia, attended by her servant Ursula ]</p>
<p>Gentlewoman, good day: I pray you, be my mean 931</p>
<p>To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.</p>
<p>SILVIA What would you with her, if that I be she 932 ?</p>
<p>JULIA If you be she, I do entreat your patience</p>
<p>To hear me speak the message I am sent on.</p>
<p>SILVIA From whom?</p>
<p>JULIA From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.</p>
<p>SILVIA O, he sends you for a picture?</p>
<p>JULIA Ay, madam.</p>
<p>SILVIA Ursula, bring my picture there.</p>
<p>Ursula brings the picture</p>
<p>Go give your master this: tell him from me,</p>
<p>One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,</p>
<p>Would better fit his chamber 933 than this shadow.</p>
<p>JULIA Madam, please you peruse this letter.</p>
<p>Gives her a letter</p>
<p>Pardon me, madam, I have unadvised 934</p>
<p>Delivered you a paper that I should not:</p>
<p>This is the letter to your ladyship.</p>
<p>Takes back the letter and gives another</p>
<p>SILVIA I pray thee, let me look on that again.</p>
<p>JULIA It may not be: good madam, pardon me.</p>
<p>SILVIA There, hold 935 .</p>
<p>I will not look upon your master’s lines:</p>
<p>I know they are stuffed with protestations 936</p>
<p>And full of newfound 937 oaths, which he will break</p>
<p>As easily as I do tear his paper.</p>
<p>Tears the letter</p>
<p>JULIA Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.</p>
<p>Offers the ring</p>
<p>SILVIA The more shame for him that he sends it me,</p>
<p>For I have heard him say a thousand times</p>
<p>His Julia gave it him at his departure.</p>
<p>Though his false finger have profaned 938 the ring,</p>
<p>Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.</p>
<p>JULIA She thanks you.</p>
<p>SILVIA What say’st thou?</p>
<p>JULIA I thank you, madam, that you tender 939 her.</p>
<p>Poor gentlewoman, my master wrongs her much.</p>
<p>SILVIA Dost thou know her?</p>
<p>JULIA Almost as well as I do know myself.</p>
<p>To think upon her woes, I do protest</p>
<p>That I have wept a hundred several times.</p>
<p>SILVIA Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her?</p>
<p>JULIA I think she doth: and that’s her cause of sorrow.</p>
<p>SILVIA Is she not passing fair?</p>
<p>JULIA She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:</p>
<p>When she did think my master loved her well,</p>
<p>She, in my judgement, was as fair as you.</p>
<p>But since she did neglect her looking-glass</p>
<p>And threw her sun-expelling mask 940 away,</p>
<p>The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks</p>
<p>And pinched the lily-tincture 941 of her face,</p>
<p>That now she is become as black as I 942 .</p>
<p>SILVIA How tall was she?</p>
<p>JULIA About my stature 943 : for at Pentecost 944 ,</p>
<p>When all our pageants of delight 945 were played,</p>
<p>Our youth got me to play the woman’s part,</p>
<p>And I was trimmed 946 in Madam Julia’s gown,</p>
<p>Which served me as fit, by all men’s judgements,</p>
<p>As if the garment had been made for me:</p>
<p>Therefore I know she is about my height.</p>
<p>And at that time I made her weep a-good 947 ,</p>
<p>For I did play a lamentable part.</p>
<p>Madam, ’twas Ariadne, passioning 948</p>
<p>For Theseus’ perjury and unjust flight 949 ,</p>
<p>Which I so lively 950 acted with my tears</p>
<p>That my poor mistress, movèd therewithal,</p>
<p>Wept bitterly: and would I might be dead</p>
<p>If I in thought felt not her very sorrow.</p>
<p>SILVIA She is beholding 951 to thee, gentle youth.</p>
<p>Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!</p>
<p>I weep myself to think upon thy words.</p>
<p>Here, youth, there is my purse: I give thee this</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>For thy sweet mistress’ sake, because thou lov’st her.</p>
<p>Farewell.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Silvia and Ursula ]</p>
<p>JULIA And she shall thank you for’t, if e’er you know her.</p>
<p>A virtuous gentlewoman, mild 952 and beautiful.</p>
<p>I hope my master’s suit will be but cold 953 ,</p>
<p>Since she respects my mistress 954 ’ love so much.</p>
<p>Alas, how love can trifle with itself!</p>
<p>Here is her picture: let me see, I think</p>
<p>If I had such a tire 955 , this face of mine</p>
<p>Were full as lovely as is this of hers.</p>
<p>And yet the painter flattered her a little,</p>
<p>Unless I flatter with myself too much.</p>
<p>Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow;</p>
<p>If that be all the difference in his love,</p>
<p>I’ll get me such a coloured periwig 956 .</p>
<p>Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:</p>
<p>Ay, but her forehead’s low, and mine’s as high 957 .</p>
<p>What should it be that he respects 958 in her</p>
<p>But I can make respective 959 in myself,</p>
<p>If this fond Love were not a blinded god?</p>
<p>Come, shadow 960 , come, and take this shadow up 961 ,</p>
<p>For ’tis thy rival.— O thou senseless form 962 ,</p>
<p>Looks at the picture</p>
<p>Thou shalt be worshipped, kissed, loved and adored;</p>
<p>And were there sense in his idolatry,</p>
<p>My substance should be statue 963 in thy stead 964 .</p>
<p>I’ll use 965 thee kindly, for thy mistress’ sake</p>
<p>That used me so: or else, by Jove 966 I vow,</p>
<p>I should have scratched out your unseeing eyes</p>
<p>To make my master out of love with thee.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
