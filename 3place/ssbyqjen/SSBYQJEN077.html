<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-2">Scene 2 ／ running scene 2</h4>
<p>Enter Lucio 78 and two other Gentlemen</p>
<p>LUCIO If the duke with the other dukes come not to composition 79
with the King of Hungary, why then all the dukes fall upon 80 the
king.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
Hungary’s 81 !</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Amen.</p>
<p>LUCIO Thou concludest like the sanctimonious 82 pirate, that went to
sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped one out of the table 83 .</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN ‘Thou shalt not steal’?</p>
<p>LUCIO Ay, that he razed 84 .</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Why, ’twas a commandment to command the captain and
all the rest from their functions 85 : they put forth 86 to steal.
There’s not a soldier of us all that, in the thanksgiving before meat 87
, do relish the petition 88 well that prays for peace.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN I never heard any soldier dislike it.</p>
<p>LUCIO I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was
said.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN No? A dozen times at least.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN What, in metre 89 ?</p>
<p>LUCIO In any proportion 90 or in any language.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN I think, or in any religion.</p>
<p>LUCIO Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy 91 : as
for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all
grace.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Well, there went but a pair of shears between us 92
.</p>
<p>LUCIO I grant, as there may between the lists 93 and the velvet. Thou
art the list.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN And thou the velvet. Thou art good velvet; thou’rt a
three-piled piece 94 , I warrant thee. I had as lief 95 be a list of an
English kersey 96 as be piled 97 , as thou art piled, for a French
velvet 98 . Do I speak feelingly 99 now?</p>
<p>LUCIO I think thou dost, and indeed, with most painful feeling 100 of
thy speech. I will, out of thine own confession 101 , learn to begin thy
health, but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee 102 .</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN I think I have done myself wrong 103 , have I
not?</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or
free 104 .</p>
<p>Enter Bawd [Mistress Overdone 105 ]</p>
<p>LUCIO Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation 106 comes! I have
purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to—</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN To what, I pray?</p>
<p>LUCIO Judge 107 .</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN To three thousand dolours 108 a year.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Ay, and more.</p>
<p>LUCIO A French crown 109 more.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Thou art always figuring 110 diseases in me, but thou
art full of error, I am sound 111 .</p>
<p>LUCIO Nay, not as one would say, healthy: but so sound as things that
are hollow; thy bones are hollow 112 , impiety 113 has made a feast of
thee.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN How now! Which of your hips has the most profound 114
sciatica 115 ?</p>
<p>To Mistress Overdone</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE Well, well. There’s one yonder arrested and carried
to prison was worth five thousand of you all.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Who’s that, I pray thee?</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE Marry 116 , sir, that’s Claudio, Signior
Claudio.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Claudio to prison? ’Tis not so.</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE Nay, but I know ’tis so. I saw him arrested, saw
him carried away, and, which is more, within these three days his head
to be chopped off.</p>
<p>LUCIO But, after 117 all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art
thou sure of this?</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE I am too sure of it. And it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child.</p>
<p>LUCIO Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two hours
since, and he was ever precise 118 in promise-keeping.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
speech we had to such a purpose 119 .</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN But most of all agreeing with the proclamation 120
.</p>
<p>LUCIO Away! Let’s go learn the truth of it.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Lucio and Gentlemen ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat 121 ,
what with the gallows and what with poverty, I am custom-shrunk 122
.</p>
<p>Enter Clown [Pompey 123 ]</p>
<p>How now? What’s the news with you?</p>
<p>POMPEY Yonder man 124 is carried to prison.</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE Well, what has he done 125 ?</p>
<p>POMPEY A woman.</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE But what’s his offence?</p>
<p>POMPEY Groping for trouts in a peculiar river 126 .</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE What, is there a maid 127 with child by him?</p>
<p>POMPEY No, but there’s a woman with maid by him. You have not heard
of the proclamation, have you?</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE What proclamation, man?</p>
<p>POMPEY All houses in the suburbs 128 of Vienna must be plucked
down.</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE And what shall become of those in the city?</p>
<p>POMPEY They shall stand for seed 129 : they had gone down too, but
that a wise burgher 130 put in 131 for them.</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE But shall all our houses of resort 132 in the
suburbs be pulled down?</p>
<p>POMPEY To the ground, mistress.</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE Why, here’s a change indeed in the commonwealth!
What shall become of me?</p>
<p>POMPEY Come, fear you not: good counsellors 133 lack no clients.
Though you change your place, you need not change your trade: I’ll be
your tapster 134 still. Courage! There will be pity taken on you; you
that have worn your eyes almost out in the service 135 , you will be
considered.</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE What’s to do here, Thomas 136 tapster? Let’s
withdraw.</p>
<p>POMPEY Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to prison, and
there’s Madam Juliet.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
