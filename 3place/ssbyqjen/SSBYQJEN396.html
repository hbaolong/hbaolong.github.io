<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-5-423">Scene 1 ／ running scene 5 423</h4>
<p>Enter Romeo alone</p>
<p>ROMEO Can I go forward 424 when my heart is here?</p>
<p>Turn back, dull earth 425 , and find thy centre 426 out.</p>
<p>Stands aside</p>
<p>Enter Benvolio with Mercutio</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Romeo! My cousin Romeo, Romeo!</p>
<p>MERCUTIO He is wise,</p>
<p>And on my life hath stol’n him home to bed.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO He ran this way and leapt this orchard 427 wall.</p>
<p>Call, good Mercutio.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Nay, I’ll conjure 428 too.</p>
<p>Romeo! Humours! 429 Madman! Passion! Lover!</p>
<p>Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh,</p>
<p>Speak but one rhyme 430 , and I am satisfied:</p>
<p>Cry but ‘Ay me’, pronounce but ‘love’ and ‘dove’,</p>
<p>Speak to my gossip 431 Venus 432 one fair word,</p>
<p>One nickname for her purblind 433 son and heir,</p>
<p>Young Abraham Cupid 434 , he that shot so true,</p>
<p>When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid 435 !—</p>
<p>He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>The ape is dead 436 , and I must conjure him.—</p>
<p>I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,</p>
<p>By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,</p>
<p>By her fine foot, straight leg and quiv’ring thigh,</p>
<p>And the demesnes 437 that there adjacent lie,</p>
<p>That in thy likeness thou appear to us.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO This cannot anger him: ’twould anger him</p>
<p>To raise a spirit 438 in his mistress’ circle 439</p>
<p>Of some strange 440 nature, letting it there stand 441</p>
<p>Till she had laid it and conjured it down 442 :</p>
<p>That were some spite 443 . My invocation</p>
<p>Is fair and honest 444 , and in his mistress’ name</p>
<p>I conjure only but to raise up him.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,</p>
<p>To be consorted with 445 the humorous 446 night:</p>
<p>Blind is his love and best befits the dark.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark 447 .</p>
<p>Now will he sit under a medlar 448 tree,</p>
<p>And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit</p>
<p>As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.—</p>
<p>O 449 Romeo, that she were, O, that she were</p>
<p>An open arse 450 and thou a pop’rin pear 451 !</p>
<p>Romeo, goodnight: I’ll to my truckle-bed 452 ,</p>
<p>This field-bed 453 is too cold for me to sleep.—</p>
<p>Come, shall we go?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Go, then, for ’tis in vain</p>
<p>To seek him here that means not to be found.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Benvolio and Mercutio ]</p>
<p>ROMEO He jests at scars that never felt a wound.</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>[Enter Juliet above 454 ]</p>
<p>But, soft, what light through yonder window breaks?</p>
<p>It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.</p>
<p>Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,</p>
<p>Who is already sick and pale with grief,</p>
<p>That thou her maid 455 art far more fair than she:</p>
<p>Be not her maid, since she is envious:</p>
<p>Her vestal livery 456 is but sick and green</p>
<p>And none but fools do wear it, cast it off.</p>
<p>It is my lady, O, it is my love!</p>
<p>O, that she knew she were!</p>
<p>She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?</p>
<p>Her eye discourses: I will answer it.</p>
<p>I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks:</p>
<p>Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,</p>
<p>Having some business, do entreat her eyes</p>
<p>To twinkle in their spheres 457 till they return.</p>
<p>What if her eyes were there, they in her head?</p>
<p>The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,</p>
<p>As daylight doth a lamp, her eye in heaven</p>
<p>Would through the airy region stream so bright</p>
<p>That birds would sing and think it were not night.</p>
<p>See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!</p>
<p>O, that I were a glove upon that hand,</p>
<p>That I might touch that cheek!</p>
<p>JULIET Ay me!</p>
<p>ROMEO She speaks:</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art</p>
<p>As glorious 458 to this night, being o’er my head</p>
<p>As is a wingèd messenger of heaven</p>
<p>Unto the white upturnèd 459 wond’ring eyes</p>
<p>Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him</p>
<p>When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds,</p>
<p>And sails upon the bosom of the air.</p>
<p>JULIET O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore 460 art thou Romeo?</p>
<p>Deny thy father and refuse thy name,</p>
<p>Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,</p>
<p>And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.</p>
<p>ROMEO Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>JULIET ’Tis but thy name that is my enemy,</p>
<p>Thou art thyself, though 461 not a Montague.</p>
<p>What’s Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,</p>
<p>Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part</p>
<p>Belonging to a man. O, be some other name.</p>
<p>What’s in a name? That which we call a rose</p>
<p>By any other word would smell as sweet,</p>
<p>So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,</p>
<p>Retain that dear perfection which he owes 462</p>
<p>Without that title. Romeo, doff 463 thy name,</p>
<p>And for 464 thy name, which is no part of thee,</p>
<p>Take all myself.</p>
<p>ROMEO I take thee at thy word:</p>
<p>To her</p>
<p>Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptized,</p>
<p>Henceforth I never will be Romeo.</p>
<p>JULIET What man art thou that thus bescreened 465 in night</p>
<p>So stumblest on my counsel 466 ?</p>
<p>ROMEO By a name</p>
<p>I know not how to tell thee who I am:</p>
<p>My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,</p>
<p>Because it is an enemy to thee.</p>
<p>Had I it written, I would tear the word.</p>
<p>JULIET My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words</p>
<p>Of thy tongue’s uttering, yet I know the sound:</p>
<p>Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?</p>
<p>ROMEO Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.</p>
<p>JULIET How cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?</p>
<p>The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,</p>
<p>And the place death, considering who thou art,</p>
<p>If any of my kinsmen find thee here.</p>
<p>ROMEO With love’s light wings did I o’er-perch 467 these walls,</p>
<p>For stony limits cannot hold love out,</p>
<p>And what love can do that dares love attempt:</p>
<p>Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.</p>
<p>JULIET If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</p>
<p>ROMEO Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye</p>
<p>Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,</p>
<p>And I am proof 468 against their enmity.</p>
<p>JULIET I would not for the world they saw thee here.</p>
<p>ROMEO I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,</p>
<p>And but 469 thou love me, let them find me here:</p>
<p>My life were better ended by their hate,</p>
<p>Than death proroguèd 470 , wanting of 471 thy love.</p>
<p>JULIET By whose direction found’st thou out this place?</p>
<p>ROMEO By love, that first did prompt me to inquire:</p>
<p>He lent me counsel 472 and I lent him eyes.</p>
<p>I am no pilot 473 , yet wert thou as far</p>
<p>As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,</p>
<p>I should adventure for such merchandise.</p>
<p>JULIET Thou know’st the mask of night is on my face,</p>
<p>Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek</p>
<p>For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight</p>
<p>Fain 474 would I dwell on form 475 , fain, fain deny</p>
<p>What I have spoke: but farewell compliment 476 !</p>
<p>Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say ‘Ay’,</p>
<p>And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swear’st,</p>
<p>Thou mayst prove false: at lovers’ perjuries</p>
<p>They say Jove 477 laughs. O gentle Romeo,</p>
<p>If thou dost love, pronounce 478 it faithfully:</p>
<p>Or if thou think’st I am too quickly won,</p>
<p>I’ll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,</p>
<p>So 479 thou wilt woo, but else 480 not for the world.</p>
<p>In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond 481 ,</p>
<p>And therefore thou mayst think my behaviour light 482 :</p>
<p>But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true</p>
<p>Than those that have more coying 483 to be strange 484 .</p>
<p>I should have been more strange, I must confess,</p>
<p>But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ware 485 ,</p>
<p>My true love’s passion: therefore pardon me,</p>
<p>And not impute this yielding to light love,</p>
<p>Which 486 the dark night hath so discoverèd 487 .</p>
<p>ROMEO Lady, by yonder blessèd moon I vow</p>
<p>That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops—</p>
<p>JULIET O, swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,</p>
<p>That monthly changes in her circlèd orb 488 ,</p>
<p>Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.</p>
<p>ROMEO What shall I swear by?</p>
<p>JULIET Do not swear at all:</p>
<p>Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious 489 self,</p>
<p>Which is the god of my idolatry,</p>
<p>And I’ll believe thee.</p>
<p>ROMEO If my heart’s dear love—</p>
<p>JULIET Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,</p>
<p>I have no joy of this contract 490 tonight:</p>
<p>It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,</p>
<p>Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be</p>
<p>Ere one can say ‘It lightens’. Sweet, goodnight!</p>
<p>This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,</p>
<p>May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.</p>
<p>Goodnight, goodnight, as sweet repose and rest</p>
<p>Come to thy heart as that within my breast!</p>
<p>ROMEO O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</p>
<p>JULIET What satisfaction 491 canst thou have tonight?</p>
<p>ROMEO Th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.</p>
<p>JULIET I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:</p>
<p>And yet I would it were 492 to give again.</p>
<p>ROMEO Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?</p>
<p>JULIET But to be frank 493 and give it thee again.</p>
<p>And yet I wish but for the thing I have.</p>
<p>My bounty 494 is as boundless as the sea,</p>
<p>My love as deep: the more I give to thee,</p>
<p>The more I have, for both are infinite.</p>
<p>I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!—</p>
<p>[Nurse ] calls within</p>
<p>Anon, good nurse!— Sweet Montague, be true.</p>
<p>Stay but a little, I will come again.</p>
<p>[Exit, above ]</p>
<p>ROMEO O blessèd, blessèd night! I am afeard,</p>
<p>Being in night, all this is but a dream,</p>
<p>Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.</p>
<p>[Enter Juliet, above ]</p>
<p>JULIET Three words, dear Romeo, and goodnight indeed.</p>
<p>If that thy bent 495 of love be honourable,</p>
<p>Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,</p>
<p>By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,</p>
<p>Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,</p>
<p>And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay,</p>
<p>And follow thee my lord throughout the world.</p>
<p>[Nurse calls ] within ‘Madam!’</p>
<p>I come, anon.— But if thou mean’st not well,</p>
<p>I do beseech thee—</p>
<p>[Nurse calls ] within ‘Madam!’</p>
<p>By and by, I come.—</p>
<p>To cease thy strife 496 , and leave me to my grief.</p>
<p>Tomorrow will I send.</p>
<p>ROMEO So thrive my soul—</p>
<p>JULIET A thousand times goodnight!</p>
<p>Exit, [above ]</p>
<p>ROMEO A thousand times the worse, to want 497 thy light.</p>
<p>Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,</p>
<p>But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.</p>
<p>Romeo starts to go</p>
<p>Enter Juliet again, [above ]</p>
<p>JULIET Hist 498 , Romeo, hist! O, for a falc’ner’s voice,</p>
<p>To lure this tassel-gentle 499 back again!</p>
<p>Bondage is hoarse 500 , and may not speak aloud,</p>
<p>Else would I tear the cave where Echo 501 lies,</p>
<p>And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,</p>
<p>With repetition of my ‘Romeo’.</p>
<p>ROMEO It is my soul that calls upon my name.</p>
<p>How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,</p>
<p>Like softest music to attending ears!</p>
<p>JULIET Romeo!</p>
<p>ROMEO My nyas 502 ?</p>
<p>JULIET What o’clock tomorrow shall I send to thee?</p>
<p>ROMEO By the hour of nine.</p>
<p>JULIET I will not fail: ’tis twenty years till then.</p>
<p>I have forgot why I did call thee back.</p>
<p>ROMEO Let me stand here till thou remember it.</p>
<p>JULIET I shall forget, to 503 have thee still 504 stand there,</p>
<p>Rememb’ring how I love thy company.</p>
<p>ROMEO And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,</p>
<p>Forgetting any other home but this.</p>
<p>JULIET ’Tis almost morning, I would have thee gone:</p>
<p>And yet no further than a wanton’s 505 bird,</p>
<p>That lets it hop a little from his hand,</p>
<p>Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves 506 ,</p>
<p>And with a silken thread plucks it back again,</p>
<p>So loving-jealous of his liberty.</p>
<p>ROMEO I would I were thy bird.</p>
<p>JULIET Sweet, so would I:</p>
<p>Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.</p>
<p>Goodnight, goodnight! Parting is such sweet sorrow,</p>
<p>That I shall say goodnight till it be morrow.</p>
<p>Exit, [above ]</p>
<p>ROMEO Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!</p>
<p>Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!</p>
<p>// The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night, //</p>
<p>// Check’ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light, //</p>
<p>// And darkness fleckled 507 like a drunkard reels //</p>
<p>// From forth 508 day’s pathway, made by Titan’s 509 wheels. //</p>
<p>Hence will I to my ghostly 510 friar’s close cell 511 ,</p>
<p>His help to crave, and my dear hap 512 to tell.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
