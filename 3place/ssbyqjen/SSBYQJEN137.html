continues</h4>
<p>Enter Armado and Moth 239 , his page</p>
<p>ARMADO Boy, what sign is it 240 when a man of great spirit grows
melancholy?</p>
<p>MOTH A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.</p>
<p>ARMADO Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp 241
.</p>
<p>MOTH No, no, O lord, sir, no.</p>
<p>ARMADO How canst thou part 242 sadness and melancholy, my tender 243
juvenal 244 ?</p>
<p>MOTH By a familiar 245 demonstration of the working 246 , my tough
señor.</p>
<p>ARMADO Why tough señor? Why tough señor?</p>
<p>MOTH Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?</p>
<p>ARMADO I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton 247
appertaining 248 to thy young days, which we may nominate 249
tender.</p>
<p>MOTH And I, tough senior, as an appertinent 250 title to your old
time, which we may name tough.</p>
<p>ARMADO Pretty 251 and apt.</p>
<p>MOTH How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? Or I apt, and my
saying pretty?</p>
<p>ARMADO Thou pretty, because little 252 .</p>
<p>MOTH Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?</p>
<p>ARMADO And therefore apt, because quick 253 .</p>
<p>MOTH Speak you this in my praise, master?</p>
<p>ARMADO In thy condign 254 praise.</p>
<p>MOTH I will praise an eel with the same praise.</p>
<p>ARMADO What, that an eel is ingenious?</p>
<p>MOTH That an eel is quick 255 .</p>
<p>ARMADO I do say thou art quick in answers. Thou heat’st my blood 256
.</p>
<p>MOTH I am answered, sir.</p>
<p>ARMADO I love not to be crossed 257 .</p>
<p>MOTH He speaks the mere 258 contrary: crosses 259 love not him.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>ARMADO I have promised to study three years with the duke 260 .</p>
<p>MOTH You may do it in an hour, sir.</p>
<p>ARMADO Impossible.</p>
<p>MOTH How many is one thrice told 261 ?</p>
<p>ARMADO I am ill 262 at reckoning 263 . It fits the spirit of a
tapster 264 .</p>
<p>MOTH You are a gentleman and a gamester 265 , sir.</p>
<p>ARMADO I confess both: they are both the varnish of a complete 266
man.</p>
<p>MOTH Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace 267
amounts to.</p>
<p>ARMADO It doth amount to one more than two.</p>
<p>MOTH Which the base vulgar 268 call three.</p>
<p>ARMADO True.</p>
<p>MOTH Why, sir, is this such a piece 269 of study? Now here’s three
studied ere you’ll thrice wink. And how easy it is to put ‘years’ to the
word ‘three’, and study three years in two words, the dancing horse 270
will tell you.</p>
<p>ARMADO A most fine figure 271 !</p>
<p>MOTH To prove you a cipher 272 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>ARMADO I will hereupon confess I am in love. And as it is base 273
for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing my
sword against the humour of affection 274 would deliver me from the
reprobate 275 thought of it, I would take desire prisoner, and ransom
him to any French courtier for a new-devised curtsy 276 . I think scorn
277 to sigh: methinks I should outswear 278 Cupid 279 . Comfort me, boy.
What great men have been in love?</p>
<p>MOTH Hercules 280 , master.</p>
<p>ARMADO Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more; and,
sweet my child, let them be men of good repute and carriage 281 .</p>
<p>MOTH Samson 282 , master. He was a man of good carriage 283 , great
carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back like a porter 284 ,
and he was in love.</p>
<p>ARMADO O well-knit 285 Samson, strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee
in my rapier 286 as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in
love too. Who was Samson’s love, my dear Moth?</p>
<p>MOTH A woman, master.</p>
<p>ARMADO Of what complexion 287 ?</p>
<p>MOTH Of all the four 288 , or the three, or the two, or one of the
four.</p>
<p>ARMADO Tell me precisely of what complexion.</p>
<p>MOTH Of the sea-water green 289 , sir.</p>
<p>ARMADO Is that one of the four complexions?</p>
<p>MOTH As I have read, sir, and the best of them too.</p>
<p>ARMADO Green 290 indeed is the colour of lovers, but to have a love
of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He surely
affected 291 her for her wit 292 .</p>
<p>MOTH It was so, sir, for she had a green 293 wit.</p>
<p>ARMADO My love is most immaculate 294 white and red.</p>
<p>MOTH Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under such colours
295 .</p>
<p>ARMADO Define 296 , define, well-educated infant.</p>
<p>MOTH My father’s wit and my mother’s tongue assist me!</p>
<p>ARMADO Sweet invocation of a child, most pretty and pathetical 297
!</p>
<p>MOTH If she be made of 298 white and red,</p>
<p>Her faults will ne’er be known,</p>
<p>For blushing cheeks by faults are bred</p>
<p>And fears by pale white shown.</p>
<p>Then if she fear, or be to blame,</p>
<p>By this 299 you shall not know,</p>
<p>For still 300 her cheeks possess the same</p>
<p>Which native 301 she doth owe 302 .</p>
<p>A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red 303
.</p>
<p>ARMADO Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar 304
?</p>
<p>MOTH The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since
305 , but I think now ’tis not to be found, or, if it were, it would
neither serve 306 for the writing nor the tune.</p>
<p>ARMADO I will have that subject newly writ o’er, that I may example
307 my digression 308 by some mighty precedent. Boy, I do love that
country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind 309 Costard.
She deserves well.</p>
<p>MOTH To be whipped 310 : and yet 311 a better love than my
master.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>ARMADO Sing, boy. My spirit grows heavy 312 in love.</p>
<p>MOTH And that’s great marvel, loving a light 313 wench.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>ARMADO I say sing.</p>
<p>MOTH Forbear till this company be past.</p>
<p>Enter [Costard, the ] Clown 314 , [Dull, the ] Constable and
[Jaquenetta, a ] wench</p>
<p>DULL Sir, the duke’s pleasure is that you keep Costard safe: and you
must let him take no delight nor no penance 315 , but he must fast three
days a week. For 316 this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she is
allowed for the dey-woman 317 . Fare you well.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>ARMADO I do betray myself with blushing.— Maid!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>JAQUENETTA Man?</p>
<p>ARMADO I will visit thee at the lodge 318 .</p>
<p>JAQUENETTA That’s hereby 319 .</p>
<p>ARMADO I know where it is situate.</p>
<p>JAQUENETTA Lord, how wise you are!</p>
<p>ARMADO I will tell thee wonders.</p>
<p>JAQUENETTA With that face 320 ?</p>
<p>ARMADO I love thee.</p>
<p>JAQUENETTA So I heard you say.</p>
<p>ARMADO And so farewell.</p>
<p>JAQUENETTA Fair weather after you.</p>
<p>COSTARD Come, Jaquenetta, away.</p>
<p>Exit [Jaquenetta ]</p>
<p>ARMADO Villain 321 , thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be
pardoned.</p>
<p>COSTARD Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a full
stomach 322 .</p>
<p>ARMADO Thou shalt be heavily punished.</p>
<p>COSTARD I am more bound 323 to you than your fellows 324 , for they
are but lightly 325 rewarded.</p>
<p>ARMADO Take away this villain. Shut him up.</p>
<p>To Moth</p>
<p>MOTH Come, you transgressing slave, away!</p>
<p>COSTARD Let me not be pent up 326 , sir, I will fast being loose 327
.</p>
<p>MOTH No, sir, that were fast and loose 328 . Thou shalt to 329
prison.</p>
<p>COSTARD Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation 330 that
I have seen, some shall see—</p>
<p>MOTH What shall some see?</p>
<p>COSTARD Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. It is not
for prisoners to be too silent 331 in their words and therefore I will
say nothing. I thank God I have as little 332 patience as another man
and therefore I can be quiet.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Moth and Costard ]</p>
<p>ARMADO I do affect 333 the very ground, which is base, where her
shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which is basest, doth tread. I
shall be forsworn 334 , which is a great argument 335 of falsehood, if I
love. And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted? Love is
a familiar 336 , love is a devil. There is no evil angel but love. Yet
Samson was so tempted, and he had an excellent strength. Yet was Solomon
337 so seduced, and he had a very good wit. Cupid’s butt-shaft 338 is
too hard for Hercules’ club, and therefore too much odds 339 for a
Spaniard’s rapier. The first and second cause 340 will not serve my turn
341 . The passado 342 he respects not, the duello 343 he regards not.
His disgrace is to be called boy, but his glory is to subdue men. Adieu,
valour: rust, rapier: be still, drum, for your manager 344 is in love;
yea, he loveth.</p>
<p>Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme 345 , for I am sure I shall
turn sonnet 346 .</p>
<p>Devise, wit: write, pen, for 347 I am for whole volumes in folio 348
.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
