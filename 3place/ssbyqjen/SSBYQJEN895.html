<p>Trumpets, sennet 756 and cornets. Enter two Vergers 757 , with short
silver wands; next them two Scribes in the habit of doctors 758 [and a
Crier ]: after them, the [Arch ]bishop of Canterbury alone: after him,
the Bishops of Lincoln, Ely, Rochester and St Asaph 759 : next them,
with some small distance, follows a Gentleman bearing the purse 760 ,
with the great seal, and a cardinal’s hat: then two Priests, bearing
each a silver cross: then a Gentleman-usher bare-headed, accompanied
with a Sergeant-at-arms, bearing a silver mace: then two Gentlemen
bearing two great silver pillars 761 : after them, side by side, the two
Cardinals [Wolsey and Campeius ], two Noblemen, with the sword and mace.
The King [Henry ] takes place under the cloth of state 762 . The two
Cardinals sit under him as judges. The Queen [Katherine, attended by
Griffith ] takes place some distance from the King. The Bishops place
themselves on each side the court in manner of a consistory 763 : below
them, the Scribes. The Lords sit next the Bishops. The rest of the
Attendants stand in convenient order about the stage</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Whilst our commission from Rome is read,</p>
<p>Let silence be commanded.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII What’s the need?</p>
<p>It hath already publicly been read,</p>
<p>And on all sides th’authority allowed 764 :</p>
<p>You may then spare that time.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Be’t so. Proceed.</p>
<p>SCRIBE Say, ‘Henry, King of England, come into the court.’</p>
<p>CRIER Henry, King of England, come into the court.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Here.</p>
<p>SCRIBE Say, ‘Katherine, Queen of England, come into the court.’</p>
<p>CRIER Katherine, Queen of England, come into the court.</p>
<p>The Queen makes no answer, rises out of her chair, goes about the
court, comes to the King, and kneels at his feet: then speaks</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Sir, I desire you do me right and justice,</p>
<p>And to bestow your pity on me, for</p>
<p>I am a most poor woman, and a stranger 765 ,</p>
<p>Born out of your dominions, having here</p>
<p>No judge indifferent 766 , nor no more assurance</p>
<p>Of equal 767 friendship and proceeding 768 . Alas, sir,</p>
<p>In what have I offended you? What cause</p>
<p>Hath my behaviour given to your displeasure,</p>
<p>That thus you should proceed to put me off 769 ,</p>
<p>And take your good grace 770 from me? Heaven witness,</p>
<p>I have been to you a true and humble wife,</p>
<p>At all times to your will conformable 771 ,</p>
<p>Ever in fear to kindle your dislike 772 ,</p>
<p>Yea, subject to your countenance 773 , glad or sorry,</p>
<p>As I saw it inclined. When was the hour</p>
<p>I ever contradicted your desire,</p>
<p>Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends</p>
<p>Have I not strove to love, although I knew</p>
<p>He were mine enemy? What friend of mine,</p>
<p>That had to him derived 774 your anger, did I</p>
<p>Continue in my liking? Nay, gave notice</p>
<p>He was from thence discharged? Sir, call to mind</p>
<p>That I have been your wife, in this obedience,</p>
<p>Upward of twenty years, and have been blessed</p>
<p>With many children 775 by you. If, in the course</p>
<p>And process of this time, you can report,</p>
<p>And prove it too, against mine honour 776 aught 777 ,</p>
<p>My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty</p>
<p>Against 778 your sacred person, in God’s name,</p>
<p>Turn me away, and let the foul’st contempt</p>
<p>Shut door upon me, and so give me up</p>
<p>To the sharp’st kind of justice. Please you, sir,</p>
<p>The king your father was reputed for</p>
<p>A prince most prudent, of an excellent</p>
<p>And unmatched wit 779 and judgement. Ferdinand</p>
<p>My father, King of Spain, was reckoned one</p>
<p>The wisest 780 prince that there had reigned by many</p>
<p>A year before. It is not to be questioned</p>
<p>That they had gathered a wise council to them</p>
<p>Of every realm, that did debate this business,</p>
<p>Who deemed our marriage lawful. Wherefore 781 I humbly</p>
<p>Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may</p>
<p>Be by my friends in Spain advised, whose counsel</p>
<p>I will implore. If not, i’th’name of God,</p>
<p>Your pleasure be fulfilled.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY You have here, lady,</p>
<p>And of your choice, these reverend fathers 782 , men</p>
<p>Of singular integrity and learning,</p>
<p>Yea, the elect 783 o’th’land, who are assembled</p>
<p>To plead your cause. It shall be therefore bootless 784</p>
<p>That longer 785 you desire 786 the court, as well</p>
<p>For your own quiet 787 , as to rectify</p>
<p>What is unsettled in the king.</p>
<p>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS His grace</p>
<p>Hath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam,</p>
<p>It’s fit this royal session 788 do proceed,</p>
<p>And that, without delay, their arguments</p>
<p>Be now produced and heard.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Lord cardinal,</p>
<p>To you I speak.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Your pleasure, madam?</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Sir,</p>
<p>I am about to weep: but, thinking that</p>
<p>We are a queen, or long have dreamed so, certain 789</p>
<p>The daughter of a king, my drops of tears</p>
<p>I’ll turn to sparks of fire.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Be patient yet.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE I will, when you are humble: nay, before 790 ,</p>
<p>Or God will punish me. I do believe,</p>
<p>Induced by potent circumstances, that</p>
<p>You are mine enemy, and make my challenge 791</p>
<p>You shall not be my judge. For it is you</p>
<p>Have blown this coal 792 betwixt my lord and me,</p>
<p>Which God’s dew quench. Therefore, I say again,</p>
<p>I utterly abhor 793 , yea, from my soul,</p>
<p>Refuse you for my judge, whom yet once more</p>
<p>I hold my most malicious foe, and think not</p>
<p>At all a friend to truth.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY I do profess</p>
<p>You speak not like yourself, who ever yet</p>
<p>Have stood to 794 charity, and displayed th’effects</p>
<p>Of disposition gentle, and of wisdom</p>
<p>O’ertopping woman’s power. Madam, you do me wrong:</p>
<p>I have no spleen 795 against you, nor injustice</p>
<p>For you or any: how far I have proceeded,</p>
<p>Or how far further shall, is warranted</p>
<p>By a commission from the consistory,</p>
<p>Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me</p>
<p>That I have blown this coal: I do deny it:</p>
<p>The king is present: if it be known to him</p>
<p>That I gainsay 796 my deed, how may he wound,</p>
<p>And worthily 797 , my falsehood: yea, as much</p>
<p>As you have done my truth. If he know</p>
<p>That I am free 798 of your report 799 , he knows</p>
<p>I am not of your wrong 800 . Therefore in 801 him</p>
<p>It lies to cure me, and the cure is to</p>
<p>Remove these thoughts from you: the which before</p>
<p>His highness shall speak in, I do beseech</p>
<p>You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking</p>
<p>And to say so no more.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE My lord, my lord,</p>
<p>I am a simple woman, much too weak</p>
<p>T’oppose your cunning. You’re meek and humble-mouthed:</p>
<p>You sign 802 your place and calling, in full seeming 803 ,</p>
<p>With meekness and humility: but your heart</p>
<p>Is crammed with arrogancy, spleen and pride.</p>
<p>You have by fortune and his highness’ favours,</p>
<p>Gone slightly 804 o’er low steps, and now are mounted</p>
<p>Where powers 805 are your retainers 806 , and your words,</p>
<p>Domestics 807 to you, serve your will as’t please</p>
<p>Yourself pronounce their office 808 . I must tell you,</p>
<p>You tender 809 more your person’s honour than</p>
<p>Your high profession spiritual, that 810 again</p>
<p>I do refuse you for my judge, and here,</p>
<p>Before you all, appeal unto the Pope,</p>
<p>To bring my whole cause 811 ’fore his holiness,</p>
<p>And to be judged by him.</p>
<p>She curtsies to the King, and offers 812 to depart</p>
<p>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS The queen is obstinate,</p>
<p>Stubborn 813 to justice, apt 814 to accuse it, and</p>
<p>Disdainful to be tried by’t: ’tis not well.</p>
<p>She’s going away.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Call her again.</p>
<p>To the Crier</p>
<p>CRIER Katherine, Queen of England, come into the court.</p>
<p>GRIFFITH Madam, you are called back.</p>
<p>To Queen Katherine</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE What need you note it? Pray you keep your way 815
:</p>
<p>When you are called, return. Now the Lord help:</p>
<p>They vex me past my patience. Pray you, pass on:</p>
<p>I will not tarry 816 : no, nor ever more</p>
<p>Upon this business my appearance make</p>
<p>In any of their courts.</p>
<p>Exeunt Queen and her Attendants</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Go thy ways, Kate.</p>
<p>That man i’th’world who shall report he has</p>
<p>A better wife, let him in naught be trusted</p>
<p>For speaking false in that: thou art alone —</p>
<p>If thy rare 817 qualities, sweet gentleness,</p>
<p>Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government 818 ,</p>
<p>Obeying in commanding 819 , and thy parts</p>
<p>Sovereign and pious else 820 , could speak thee out 821 —</p>
<p>The queen of earthly queens: she’s noble born:</p>
<p>And like her true nobility, she has</p>
<p>Carried 822 herself towards me.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Most gracious sir,</p>
<p>In humblest manner I require 823 your highness,</p>
<p>That it shall please you to declare in hearing</p>
<p>Of all these ears — for where I am robbed and bound,</p>
<p>There must I be unloosed, although not there</p>
<p>At once and fully satisfied 824 — whether ever I</p>
<p>Did broach this business to your highness, or</p>
<p>Laid any scruple in your way, which might</p>
<p>Induce you to the question on’t, or ever</p>
<p>Have to you, but with thanks to God for such</p>
<p>A royal lady, spake one the least word that might</p>
<p>Be to the prejudice 825 of her present state 826 ,</p>
<p>Or touch 827 of her good person?</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII My lord cardinal,</p>
<p>I do excuse 828 you: yea, upon mine honour,</p>
<p>I free you from’t: you are not to be taught 829</p>
<p>That you have many enemies, that know not</p>
<p>Why they are so, but like to village curs 830 ,</p>
<p>Bark when their fellows do. By some of these</p>
<p>The queen is put in anger. You’re excused:</p>
<p>But will you be more justified? You ever</p>
<p>Have wished the sleeping of this business, never desired</p>
<p>It to be stirred, but oft have hindered, oft,</p>
<p>The passages 831 made toward it: on my honour,</p>
<p>I speak 832 th’inducementmy good lord card’nal to this point,</p>
<p>And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to’t,</p>
<p>I will be bold with time and your attention:</p>
<p>Then mark th’inducement 833 . Thus it came: give heed to’t:</p>
<p>My conscience first received a tenderness 834 ,</p>
<p>Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches uttered</p>
<p>By th’Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador,</p>
<p>Who had been hither sent on the debating</p>
<p>A marriage ’twixt 835 the Duke of Orléans and</p>
<p>Our daughter Mary: i’th’progress of this business,</p>
<p>Ere a determinate resolution 836 , he,</p>
<p>I mean the bishop, did require a respite,</p>
<p>Wherein he might the king his lord advertise 837</p>
<p>Whether our daughter were legitimate,</p>
<p>Respecting this our marriage with the dowager 838 ,</p>
<p>Sometimes 839 our brother’s wife. This respite shook</p>
<p>The bosom of my conscience, entered me,</p>
<p>Yea, with a spitting 840 power, and made to tremble</p>
<p>The region of my breast, which forced such way,</p>
<p>That many mazed considerings 841 did throng</p>
<p>And pressed in with this caution. First, methought</p>
<p>I stood not in the smile 842 of heaven, who had</p>
<p>Commanded nature that my lady’s womb,</p>
<p>If it conceived a male child by me, should</p>
<p>Do no more offices 843 of life to’t than</p>
<p>The grave does to th’dead: for her male issue</p>
<p>Or 844 died where they were made, or shortly after</p>
<p>This world had aired them 845 . Hence I took a thought,</p>
<p>This was a judgement on me, that my kingdom,</p>
<p>Well worthy the best heir o’th’world, should not</p>
<p>Be gladded 846 in’t by me. Then follows that</p>
<p>I weighed the danger which my realms stood in</p>
<p>By this my issue’s 847 fail, and that gave to me</p>
<p>Many a groaning throe 848 : thus hulling 849 in</p>
<p>The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</p>
<p>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</p>
<p>Now present here together: that’s to say,</p>
<p>I meant to rectify my conscience, which</p>
<p>I then did feel full 850 sick, and yet 851 not well,</p>
<p>By all the reverend fathers of the land</p>
<p>And doctors 852 learned. First I began in private</p>
<p>With you, my lord of Lincoln: you remember</p>
<p>How under my oppression 853 I did reek 854</p>
<p>When I first moved 855 you.</p>
<p>LINCOLN Very well, my liege.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say</p>
<p>How far you satisfied 856 me.</p>
<p>LINCOLN So please your highness,</p>
<p>The question did at first so stagger me,</p>
<p>Bearing a state of mighty moment in’t</p>
<p>And consequence of dread 857 , that I committed</p>
<p>The daring’st counsel which I had to doubt 858 ,</p>
<p>And did entreat your highness to this course</p>
<p>Which you are running here.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII I then moved you,</p>
<p>To Canterbury</p>
<p>My lord of Canterbury, and got your leave</p>
<p>To make this present summons: unsolicited</p>
<p>I left no reverend person in this court,</p>
<p>But by particular 859 consent proceeded</p>
<p>Under your hands and seals 860 : therefore, go on:</p>
<p>For no dislike i’th’world against the person</p>
<p>Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points</p>
<p>Of my alleged reasons, drives this forward:</p>
<p>Prove but 861 our marriage lawful, by my life</p>
<p>And kingly dignity, we are contented</p>
<p>To wear our mortal state to come 862 with her,</p>
<p>Katherine our queen, before the primest 863 creature</p>
<p>That’s paragoned 864 o’th’world.</p>
<p>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS So please your highness,</p>
<p>The queen being absent, ’tis a needful fitness 865</p>
<p>That we adjourn this court till further 866 day:</p>
<p>Meanwhile must be an earnest motion 867</p>
<p>Made to the queen, to call back her appeal</p>
<p>She intends unto his holiness 868 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII I may perceive</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor</p>
<p>This dilatory 869 sloth and tricks of Rome.</p>
<p>My learned and well-belovèd servant, Cranmer 870 ,</p>
<p>Prithee return 871 : with thy approach, I know,</p>
<p>My comfort comes along.— Break up the court:</p>
<p>Aloud</p>
<p>I say, set on 872 .</p>
<p>Exeunt in manner as they entered</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
