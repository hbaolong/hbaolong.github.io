<h4 id="scene-1-1-running-scene-1">Scene 1 1 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Flourish 2 . Enter the Tribunes 3 and Senators, aloft 4 . And then
enter Saturninus 5 and his followers at one door [below], and Bassianus
and his followers at the other, with Drum and Colours 6</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Noble patricians 7 , patrons 8 of my right,</p>
<p>Defend the justice of my cause with arms.</p>
<p>And countrymen, my loving followers,</p>
<p>Plead my successive 9 title with your swords.</p>
<p>I was the first-born son that 10 was the last</p>
<p>That wore the imperial diadem 11 of Rome:</p>
<p>Then let my father’s honours 12 live in me,</p>
<p>Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.</p>
<p>BASSIANUS Romans, friends, followers, favourers of my right,</p>
<p>If ever Bassianus, Caesar’s son,</p>
<p>Were gracious 13 in the eyes of royal Rome,</p>
<p>Keep 14 then this passage to the Capitol 15 ,</p>
<p>And suffer not 16 dishonour to approach</p>
<p>Th’imperial seat, to virtue consecrate 17 ,</p>
<p>To justice, continence 18 and nobility:</p>
<p>But let desert 19 in pure election 20 shine,</p>
<p>And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.</p>
<p>Enter Marcus Andronicus, aloft, with the crown</p>
<p>MARCUS Princes, that strive by factions and by friends</p>
<p>Ambitiously for rule and empery 21 ,</p>
<p>Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand</p>
<p>A special party 22 , have by common voice 23</p>
<p>In election for the Roman empery,</p>
<p>Chosen Andronicus, surnamèd 24 Pius 25</p>
<p>For many good and great deserts 26 to Rome:</p>
<p>A nobler man, a braver warrior,</p>
<p>Lives not this day within the city walls.</p>
<p>He by the senate is accited 27 home</p>
<p>From weary wars against the barbarous Goths,</p>
<p>That 28 with his sons, a terror to our foes,</p>
<p>Hath yoked 29 a nation strong, trained up in arms.</p>
<p>Ten years are spent since first he undertook</p>
<p>This cause of Rome and chastisèd with arms</p>
<p>Our enemies’ pride: five times he hath returned</p>
<p>Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons</p>
<p>In coffins from the field,</p>
<p>And now at last, laden with horror’s spoils,</p>
<p>Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,</p>
<p>Renownèd Titus, flourishing 30 in arms.</p>
<p>Let us entreat, by honour of his name,</p>
<p>Whom worthily you would have now succeed 31 ,</p>
<p>And in the Capitol and senate’s right,</p>
<p>Whom you pretend 32 to honour and adore,</p>
<p>That you withdraw you and abate your strength,</p>
<p>Dismiss your followers and, as suitors 33 should,</p>
<p>Plead your deserts 34 in peace and humbleness.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS How fair 35 the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!</p>
<p>BASSIANUS Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy 36</p>
<p>In thy uprightness and integrity,</p>
<p>And so I love and honour thee and thine,</p>
<p>Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,</p>
<p>And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all 37 ,</p>
<p>Gracious Lavinia, Rome’s rich ornament,</p>
<p>That I will here dismiss my loving friends,</p>
<p>And to my fortunes and the people’s favour</p>
<p>Commit my cause in balance to be weighed.</p>
<p>Exeunt [his ] Soldiers</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Friends, that have been thus forward in 38 my right,</p>
<p>I thank you all and here dismiss you all,</p>
<p>And to the love and favour of my country</p>
<p>Commit myself, my person and the cause.</p>
<p>[Exeunt his Soldiers ]</p>
<p>Rome, be as just and gracious unto me</p>
<p>As I am confident and kind 39 to thee.</p>
<p>Open the gates and let me in.</p>
<p>BASSIANUS Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor 40 .</p>
<p>Flourish. They [Saturninus and Bassianus] go up into the senate
house. Enter a Captain</p>
<p>CAPTAIN Romans, make way: the good Andronicus,</p>
<p>Patron 41 of virtue, Rome’s best champion 42 ,</p>
<p>Successful in the battles that he fights,</p>
<p>With honour and with fortune is returned</p>
<p>From whence he circumscribèd 43 with his sword</p>
<p>And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.</p>
<p>Sound drums and trumpets, and then enter two of Titus’ sons [Martius
and Mutius]. After them, two men bearing a coffin covered with black,
then two other sons [Lucius and Quintus]. After them, Titus Andronicus
[in a chariot], and then Tamora 44 , Queen of Goths, and her two sons
Chiron and Demetrius, with Aaron 45 the Moor 46 and others, as many as
can be. They set down the coffin and Titus speaks</p>
<p>TITUS Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds 47 !</p>
<p>Lo, as the bark 48 that hath discharged his freight</p>
<p>Returns with precious lading 49 to the bay</p>
<p>From whence at first she weighed her anchorage 50 ,</p>
<p>Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,</p>
<p>To resalute his country with his tears,</p>
<p>Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.</p>
<p>Thou 51 great defender of this Capitol,</p>
<p>Stand gracious to 52 the rites that we intend.</p>
<p>Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,</p>
<p>Half of the number that King Priam 53 had,</p>
<p>Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!</p>
<p>These that survive, let Rome reward with love:</p>
<p>These that I bring unto their latest 54 home,</p>
<p>With 55 burial amongst their ancestors.</p>
<p>Here Goths have given me leave 56 to sheathe my sword.</p>
<p>Titus, unkind 57 and careless 58 of thine own,</p>
<p>Why suffer’st thou thy sons unburied yet</p>
<p>To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx 59 ?</p>
<p>Make way to lay them by their brethren.</p>
<p>They open the tomb</p>
<p>There greet in silence, as the dead are wont 60 ,</p>
<p>And sleep in peace, slain in your country’s wars.</p>
<p>O sacred receptacle of my joys,</p>
<p>Sweet cell 61 of virtue and nobility,</p>
<p>How many sons of mine hast thou in store,</p>
<p>That thou wilt never render to me more 62 !</p>
<p>LUCIUS Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,</p>
<p>That we may hew 63 his limbs, and on a pile</p>
<p>Ad manus fratrum 64 sacrifice his flesh</p>
<p>Before this earthly prison of their bones,</p>
<p>That so 65 the shadows 66 be not unappeased,</p>
<p>Nor we disturbed with prodigies 67 on earth.</p>
<p>TITUS I give him you, the noblest that survives,</p>
<p>The eldest son of this distressèd queen.</p>
<p>TAMORA Stay, Roman brethren, gracious 68 conqueror,</p>
<p>↓ Kneels ↓</p>
<p>Victorious Titus, rue 69 the tears I shed,</p>
<p>A mother’s tears in passion 70 for her son:</p>
<p>And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,</p>
<p>O, think my sons to be as dear to me.</p>
<p>Sufficeth 71 not that we are brought to Rome</p>
<p>To beautify thy triumphs 72 and return,</p>
<p>Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke?</p>
<p>But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets</p>
<p>For valiant doings in their country’s cause?</p>
<p>O, if to fight for king and commonweal</p>
<p>Were piety in thine, it is in these.</p>
<p>Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood.</p>
<p>Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?</p>
<p>Draw near them then in being merciful:</p>
<p>Sweet mercy is nobility’s true badge.</p>
<p>Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.</p>
<p>TITUS Patient 73 yourself, madam, and pardon me.</p>
<p>These are the brethren whom you Goths beheld</p>
<p>Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain</p>
<p>Religiously they ask a sacrifice:</p>
<p>To this your son is marked, and die he must,</p>
<p>To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Away with him, and make a fire straight 74 ,</p>
<p>And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,</p>
<p>Let’s hew his limbs till they be clean 75 consumed.</p>
<p>Exeunt Sons [Lucius, Quintus, Martius and Mutius] with Alarbus</p>
<p>TAMORA O cruel, irreligious piety!</p>
<p>Rises</p>
<p>CHIRON Was ever Scythia 76 half so barbarous?</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Oppose 77 not Scythia to ambitious Rome.</p>
<p>Alarbus goes to rest and we survive</p>
<p>To tremble under Titus’ threat’ning looks.</p>
<p>Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal 78</p>
<p>The self-same gods that armed the Queen of Troy</p>
<p>With opportunity of sharp revenge</p>
<p>Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent 79</p>
<p>May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths —</p>
<p>When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen —</p>
<p>To quit 80 the bloody wrongs upon her foes.</p>
<p>Enter the Sons of Andronicus again</p>
<p>LUCIUS See, lord and father, how we have performed</p>
<p>Our Roman rites: Alarbus’ limbs are lopped,</p>
<p>And entrails 81 feed the sacrificing fire,</p>
<p>Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky.</p>
<p>Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren</p>
<p>And with loud ’larums 82 welcome them to Rome.</p>
<p>TITUS Let it be so, and let Andronicus</p>
<p>Make this his latest 83 farewell to their souls.</p>
<p>Flourish. Then sound trumpets, and lay the coffins in the tomb</p>
<p>In peace and honour rest you here, my sons:</p>
<p>Rome’s readiest champions, repose you here in rest,</p>
<p>Secure from worldly chances and mishaps.</p>
<p>Here lurks no treason, here no envy 84 swells,</p>
<p>Here grow no damnèd grudges, here are no storms,</p>
<p>No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:</p>
<p>In peace and honour rest you here, my sons.</p>
<p>Enter Lavinia</p>
<p>LAVINIA In peace and honour live Lord Titus long:</p>
<p>My noble lord and father, live in fame 85 !</p>
<p>Lo, at this tomb my tributary 86 tears</p>
<p>I render for my brethren’s obsequies 87 ,</p>
<p>And at thy feet I kneel with tears of joy</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>Shed on the earth for thy return to Rome.</p>
<p>O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,</p>
<p>Whose fortune Rome’s best citizens applaud.</p>
<p>TITUS Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved</p>
<p>The cordial 88 of mine age to glad my heart.</p>
<p>Lavinia, live, outlive thy father’s days</p>
<p>And fame’s eternal date, for virtue’s praise 89 .</p>
<p>Lavinia rises</p>
<p>[Enter Marcus, below]</p>
<p>MARCUS Long live Lord Titus, my belovèd brother,</p>
<p>Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!</p>
<p>TITUS Thanks, gentle 90 tribune, noble brother Marcus.</p>
<p>MARCUS And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,</p>
<p>You that survive and you that sleep in fame.</p>
<p>Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all 91 ,</p>
<p>That in your country’s service drew your swords:</p>
<p>But safer triumph 92 is this funeral pomp</p>
<p>That hath aspired 93 to Solon’s happiness 94</p>
<p>And triumphs over chance in honour’s bed 95 .</p>
<p>Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,</p>
<p>Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,</p>
<p>Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust 96 ,</p>
<p>This palliament 97 of white and spotless hue,</p>
<p>And name thee in election for the empire</p>
<p>With these our late-deceasèd emperor’s sons:</p>
<p>Be candidatus 98 then and put it on,</p>
<p>Offers a robe</p>
<p>And help to set a head on headless Rome.</p>
<p>TITUS A better head her glorious body fits 99</p>
<p>Than his that shakes for age and feebleness.</p>
<p>What, should I don this robe and trouble you?</p>
<p>Be chosen with proclamations today,</p>
<p>Tomorrow yield up rule, resign my life</p>
<p>And set abroad 100 new business for you all?</p>
<p>Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,</p>
<p>And led my country’s strength successfully,</p>
<p>And buried one and twenty valiant sons,</p>
<p>Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms</p>
<p>In right and service 101 of their noble country:</p>
<p>Give me a staff of honour for mine age,</p>
<p>But not a sceptre to control the world.</p>
<p>Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.</p>
<p>MARCUS Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask 102 the empery.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?</p>
<p>TITUS Patience, Prince Saturninus—</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Romans, do me right.</p>
<p>Patricians, draw your swords and sheathe them not</p>
<p>Till Saturninus be Rome’s emperor.</p>
<p>Andronicus, would 103 thou wert shipped to hell,</p>
<p>Rather than rob me of the people’s hearts.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good</p>
<p>That noble-minded Titus means to thee.</p>
<p>TITUS Content thee, prince, I will restore to thee</p>
<p>The people’s hearts, and wean them from themselves 104 .</p>
<p>BASSIANUS Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,</p>
<p>But honour thee, and will do till I die:</p>
<p>My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,</p>
<p>I will most thankful be, and thanks to men</p>
<p>Of noble minds is honourable meed 105 .</p>
<p>TITUS People of Rome, and noble tribunes here,</p>
<p>I ask your voices and your suffrages 106 ,</p>
<p>Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?</p>
<p>TRIBUNES To gratify the good Andronicus</p>
<p>And gratulate 107 his safe return to Rome,</p>
<p>The people will accept whom he admits 108 .</p>
<p>TITUS Tribunes, I thank you, and this suit 109 I make,</p>
<p>That you create 110 our emperor’s eldest son,</p>
<p>Lord Saturnine, whose virtues will, I hope,</p>
<p>Reflect on Rome as Titan 111 ’s rays on earth,</p>
<p>And ripen justice in this commonweal:</p>
<p>Then if you will elect by my advice,</p>
<p>Crown him and say, ‘Long live our emperor!’</p>
<p>MARCUS With voices and applause of every sort,</p>
<p>Patricians and plebeians, we create</p>
<p>Lord Saturninus Rome’s great emperor,</p>
<p>And say, ‘Long live our Emperor Saturnine!’</p>
<p>A long flourish till they come down</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Titus Andronicus, for thy favours done</p>
<p>To us in our election this day,</p>
<p>I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts 112 ,</p>
<p>And will with deeds requite thy gentleness 113 :</p>
<p>And, for an onset 114 , Titus, to advance</p>
<p>Thy name and honourable family,</p>
<p>Lavinia will I make my emperess,</p>
<p>Rome’s royal mistress, mistress of my heart,</p>
<p>And in the sacred Pantheon 115 her espouse:</p>
<p>Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion 116 please thee?</p>
<p>TITUS It doth, my worthy lord, and in this match</p>
<p>I hold me 117 highly honoured of 118 your grace,</p>
<p>And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,</p>
<p>King and commander of our commonweal,</p>
<p>The wide world’s emperor, do I consecrate</p>
<p>My sword, my chariot and my prisoners,</p>
<p>Presents well worthy Rome’s imperial lord:</p>
<p>Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,</p>
<p>Titus’ sword, chariot and prisoners are given to Saturninus</p>
<p>Mine honour’s ensigns 119 humbled at thy feet.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life.</p>
<p>How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts,</p>
<p>Rome shall record, and when I do forget</p>
<p>The least of these unspeakable 120 deserts,</p>
<p>Romans forget your fealty 121 to me.</p>
<p>TITUS Now, madam, are you prisoner to an emperor,</p>
<p>To Tamora</p>
<p>To him that for 122 your honour and your state 123 ,</p>
<p>Will use 124 you nobly and your followers.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS A goodly lady, trust me, of the hue 125</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>That I would choose, were I to choose anew.—</p>
<p>Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:</p>
<p>To Tamora</p>
<p>Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer 126 ,</p>
<p>Thou com’st not to be made a scorn in Rome:</p>
<p>Princely shall be thy usage every way.</p>
<p>Rest 127 on my word, and let not discontent</p>
<p>Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts 128 you</p>
<p>Can make you greater than the queen of Goths.—</p>
<p>Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?</p>
<p>LAVINIA Not I, my lord, sith 129 true nobility</p>
<p>Warrants 130 these words in princely courtesy.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Thanks, sweet Lavinia.— Romans, let us go.</p>
<p>Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:</p>
<p>Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.</p>
<p>Sound music; prisoners released</p>
<p>BASSIANUS Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.</p>
<p>Seizes Lavinia</p>
<p>TITUS How, sir? Are you in earnest then, my lord?</p>
<p>BASSIANUS Ay, noble Titus, and resolved withal 131</p>
<p>To do myself this reason 132 and this right.</p>
<p>MARCUS ‘Suum cuique’ 133 is our Roman justice:</p>
<p>This prince in justice seizeth but his own.</p>
<p>LUCIUS And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.</p>
<p>TITUS Traitors, avaunt 134 ! Where is the emperor’s guard?—</p>
<p>Treason, my lord: Lavinia is surprised 135 !</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Surprised? By whom?</p>
<p>BASSIANUS By him that justly may</p>
<p>Bear his betrothed from all the world away.</p>
<p>MUTIUS Brothers, help to convey her hence away,</p>
<p>And with my sword I’ll keep this door safe.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Bassianus, Lavinia, Marcus, Martius, Quintus ]</p>
<p>TITUS Follow, my lord, and I’ll soon bring her back.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Saturninus and Goths ]</p>
<p>MUTIUS My lord, you pass not here.</p>
<p>TITUS What, villain boy, barr’st me my way in Rome?</p>
<p>He kills him</p>
<p>MUTIUS Help, Lucius, help 136 !</p>
<p>LUCIUS My lord, you are unjust, and, more than so:</p>
<p>In wrongful quarrel 137 you have slain your son.</p>
<p>TITUS Nor 138 thou, nor he, are any sons of mine:</p>
<p>My sons would never so dishonour me.</p>
<p>Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Dead, if you will, but not to be his wife</p>
<p>That is another’s lawful promised love.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>Enter aloft the Emperor with Tamora and her two sons, and Aaron the
Moor</p>
<p>SATURNINUS No, Titus, no, the emperor needs her not,</p>
<p>Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock.</p>
<p>I’ll trust by leisure 139 him that mocks me once,</p>
<p>Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,</p>
<p>Confederates all thus to dishonour me.</p>
<p>Was none 140 in Rome to make a stale 141</p>
<p>But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,</p>
<p>Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine,</p>
<p>That said’st I begged the empire at thy hands.</p>
<p>TITUS O, monstrous! What reproachful words are these?</p>
<p>SATURNINUS But go thy ways, go give that changing piece 142</p>
<p>To him that flourished 143 for her with his sword.</p>
<p>A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy,</p>
<p>One fit to bandy 144 with thy lawless sons,</p>
<p>To ruffle 145 in the commonwealth of Rome.</p>
<p>TITUS These words are razors to my wounded heart.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS And therefore, lovely Tamora, Queen of Goths,</p>
<p>That like the stately Phoebe 146 ’mongst her nymphs</p>
<p>Dost overshine 147 the gallant’st 148 dames of Rome,</p>
<p>If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,</p>
<p>Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,</p>
<p>And will create thee emperess of Rome,</p>
<p>Speak, queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?</p>
<p>And here I swear by all the Roman gods,</p>
<p>Sith priest and holy water are so near</p>
<p>And tapers 149 burn so bright and everything</p>
<p>In readiness for Hymenaeus 150 stand,</p>
<p>I will not resalute the streets of Rome,</p>
<p>Or climb my palace, till from forth this place</p>
<p>I lead espoused my bride along with me.</p>
<p>TAMORA And here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear,</p>
<p>If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,</p>
<p>She will a handmaid be to his desires,</p>
<p>A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon 151 . Lords, accompany</p>
<p>Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,</p>
<p>Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,</p>
<p>Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquerèd 152 :</p>
<p>There shall we consummate our spousal rites.</p>
<p>Exeunt all. [Titus remains ]</p>
<p>TITUS I am not bid 153 to wait upon this bride.</p>
<p>Titus, when wert thou wont 154 to walk alone,</p>
<p>Dishonoured thus, and challengèd 155 of wrongs?</p>
<p>Enter Marcus and Titus’ sons [Lucius, Quintus and Martius ]</p>
<p>MARCUS O Titus, see! O, see what thou hast done!</p>
<p>In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.</p>
<p>TITUS No, foolish tribune, no. No son of mine,</p>
<p>Nor thou, nor these, confed’rates in the deed</p>
<p>That hath dishonoured all our family:</p>
<p>Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons.</p>
<p>LUCIUS But let us give him burial as becomes 156 :</p>
<p>Give Mutius burial with our brethren.</p>
<p>TITUS Traitors, away! He rests not in this tomb.</p>
<p>This monument five hundred years hath stood,</p>
<p>Which I have sumptuously re-edified 157 :</p>
<p>Here none but soldiers and Rome’s servitors 158</p>
<p>Repose in fame — none basely slain in brawls.</p>
<p>Bury him where you can, he comes not here.</p>
<p>MARCUS My lord, this is impiety in you:</p>
<p>My nephew Mutius’ deeds do plead for him,</p>
<p>He must be buried with his bretheren 159 .</p>
<p>TITUS’ TWO SONS 160 And shall, or him we will accompany.</p>
<p>TITUS ‘And shall’? What villain was it that spake that word?</p>
<p>TITUS’ SON He that would vouch 161 it in any place but here.</p>
<p>TITUS What, would you bury him in my despite 162 ?</p>
<p>MARCUS No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee</p>
<p>To pardon Mutius and to bury him.</p>
<p>TITUS Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest 163 ,</p>
<p>And with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded.</p>
<p>My foes I do repute 164 you every one,</p>
<p>So trouble me no more, but get you gone.</p>
<p>FIRST SON He is not himself, let us withdraw.</p>
<p>SECOND SON Not I, till Mutius’ bones be buried.</p>
<p>The brother [Marcus] and the sons kneel</p>
<p>MARCUS Brother, for in that name doth nature plead—</p>
<p>SECOND SON Father, and in that name doth nature speak—</p>
<p>TITUS Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed 165 .</p>
<p>MARCUS Renownèd Titus, more than half my soul—</p>
<p>LUCIUS Dear father, soul and substance of us all—</p>
<p>MARCUS Suffer 166 thy brother Marcus to inter</p>
<p>His noble nephew here in virtue’s nest,</p>
<p>That died in honour and Lavinia’s cause.</p>
<p>Thou art a Roman, be not barbarous.</p>
<p>The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax</p>
<p>That slew himself, and wise Laertes’ son</p>
<p>Did graciously plead for his funerals 167 :</p>
<p>Let not young Mutius then, that was thy joy,</p>
<p>Be barred his entrance here.</p>
<p>TITUS Rise, Marcus, rise.</p>
<p>The dismall’st 168 day is this that e’er I saw:</p>
<p>To be dishonoured by my sons in Rome!</p>
<p>Well, bury him, and bury me the next.</p>
<p>They put him in the tomb</p>
<p>LUCIUS There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,</p>
<p>Till we with trophies 169 do adorn thy tomb.</p>
<p>MARCUS and TITUS’ SONS No man shed tears for noble Mutius:</p>
<p>He lives in fame that died in virtue’s cause.</p>
<p>Exeunt. [Titus and Marcus remain ]</p>
<p>MARCUS My lord, to step out of these sudden dumps 170 ,</p>
<p>How comes it that the subtle 171 Queen of Goths</p>
<p>Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?</p>
<p>TITUS I know not, Marcus, but I know it is 172 —</p>
<p>Whether by device 173 or no — the heavens can tell.</p>
<p>Is she not then beholding 174 to the man</p>
<p>That brought her for this high good turn so far?</p>
<p>MARCUS Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.</p>
<p>Flourish. Enter the Emperor, Tamora and her two sons with the Moor at
one door. Enter at the other door Bassianus and Lavinia with others
[Titus’ three sons ]</p>
<p>SATURNINUS So, Bassianus, you have played your prize 175 :</p>
<p>God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride.</p>
<p>BASSIANUS And you of yours, my lord. I say no more,</p>
<p>Nor wish no less, and so I take my leave.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,</p>
<p>Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape 176 .</p>
<p>BASSIANUS ‘Rape’ call you it, my lord, to seize my own,</p>
<p>My true-betrothèd love and now my wife?</p>
<p>But let the laws of Rome determine all:</p>
<p>Meanwhile I am possessed of that 177 is mine.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS ’Tis good 178 , sir: you are very short with us.</p>
<p>But if we live we’ll be as sharp 179 with you.</p>
<p>BASSIANUS My lord, what I have done, as best I may,</p>
<p>Answer 180 I must, and shall do with my life.</p>
<p>Only thus much I give your grace to know:</p>
<p>By all the duties that I owe to Rome,</p>
<p>This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,</p>
<p>Is in opinion 181 and in honour wronged,</p>
<p>That in the rescue of Lavinia</p>
<p>With his own hand did slay his youngest son</p>
<p>In zeal to you, and highly moved to wrath</p>
<p>To be controlled 182 in that he frankly 183 gave:</p>
<p>Receive him then to favour, Saturnine,</p>
<p>That hath expressed himself in all his deeds</p>
<p>A father and a friend to thee and Rome.</p>
<p>TITUS Prince Bassianus, leave to plead 184 my deeds:</p>
<p>’Tis thou and those 185 that have dishonoured me.</p>
<p>Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>How I have loved and honoured Saturnine!</p>
<p>TAMORA My worthy lord, if ever Tamora</p>
<p>To Saturninus</p>
<p>Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,</p>
<p>Then hear me speak indifferently 186 for all,</p>
<p>And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS What, madam, be dishonoured openly,</p>
<p>And basely put it up 187 without revenge?</p>
<p>TAMORA Not so, my lord. The gods of Rome forfend 188</p>
<p>I should be author to dishonour 189 you.</p>
<p>But on mine honour dare I undertake 190</p>
<p>For good Lord Titus’ innocence in all,</p>
<p>Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs 191 :</p>
<p>Then at my suit look graciously on him.</p>
<p>Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose 192 ,</p>
<p>Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.—</p>
<p>My lord, be ruled by me, be won at last,</p>
<p>Aside to Saturninus</p>
<p>Dissemble 193 all your griefs and discontents.</p>
<p>You are but newly planted in your throne:</p>
<p>Lest then the people, and patricians too,</p>
<p>Upon a just survey 194 take Titus’ part,</p>
<p>And so supplant you for ingratitude,</p>
<p>Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,</p>
<p>Yield at entreats 195 — and then let me alone 196 :</p>
<p>I’ll find a day to massacre them all,</p>
<p>And raze 197 their faction and their family,</p>
<p>The cruel father and his traitorous sons</p>
<p>To whom I suèd 198 for my dear son’s life,</p>
<p>And make them know what ’tis to let a queen</p>
<p>Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.—</p>
<p>Come, come, sweet emperor.— Come, Andronicus —</p>
<p>Aloud</p>
<p>Take up 199 this good old man, and cheer the heart</p>
<p>That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Rise, Titus, rise: my empress hath prevailed.</p>
<p>TITUS I thank your majesty and her, my lord:</p>
<p>Rises</p>
<p>These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.</p>
<p>TAMORA Titus, I am incorporate in 200 Rome,</p>
<p>A Roman now adopted happily 201 ,</p>
<p>And must advise the emperor for his good.</p>
<p>This day all quarrels die, Andronicus:</p>
<p>And let it be mine honour, good my lord,</p>
<p>That I have reconciled your friends and you.—</p>
<p>For 202 you, Prince Bassianus, I have passed</p>
<p>My word and promise to the emperor,</p>
<p>That you will be more mild and tractable.—</p>
<p>And fear not, lords, and you, Lavinia:</p>
<p>By my advice, all humbled on your knees,</p>
<p>You shall ask pardon of his majesty.</p>
<p>Titus’ s sons kneel</p>
<p>LUCIUS We do, and vow to heaven and to his highness</p>
<p>That what we did was mildly as we might,</p>
<p>Tend’ring 203 our sister’s honour and our own.</p>
<p>MARCUS That on mine honour here I do protest 204 .</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Away, and talk not: trouble us no more.</p>
<p>TAMORA Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends:</p>
<p>The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace,</p>
<p>I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother’s here,</p>
<p>And at my lovely Tamora’s entreats,</p>
<p>I do remit these young men’s heinous faults.—</p>
<p>[Marcus and Titus’ sons] stand up</p>
<p>Lavinia, though you left me like a churl 205 ,</p>
<p>I found a friend 206 , and sure as death I swore</p>
<p>I would not part a bachelor from the priest.</p>
<p>Come, if the emperor’s court can feast two brides,</p>
<p>You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.</p>
<p>This day shall be a love-day 207 , Tamora.</p>
<p>TITUS Tomorrow, an 208 it please your majesty</p>
<p>To hunt the panther and the hart 209 with me,</p>
<p>With horn and hound we’ll give your grace bonjour 210 .</p>
<p>SATURNINUS Be it so, Titus, and gramercy 211 too.</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
