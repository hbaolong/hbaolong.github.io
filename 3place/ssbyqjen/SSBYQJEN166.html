<h4 id="introduction-to-the-merchant-of-venice">Introduction to The
Merchant of Venice</h4>
<p>In the summer of 1598, the Lord Chamberlain’s Men registered their
right to print ‘a book of the Merchant of Venice or otherwise called the
Jew of Venice’. Two years later the play was published with a title page
intended to whet the prospective reader’s appetite: The most excellent
History of the Merchant of Venice. With the extreme cruelty of Shylock
the Jew towards the said Merchant, in cutting a just pound of his flesh,
and the obtaining of Portia by the choice of three chests . The
character of Shylock and the courtship of Portia by Bassanio were
clearly considered the play’s principal selling points. If The Jew of
Venice was actually an alternative title for the stage, then there was a
clear echo of one of the biggest box-office successes of the age,
Christopher Marlowe’s The Jew of Malta . What, then, of Antonio the
merchant?</p>
<p>In no other Shakespearean play does the titular character have such a
small role: Portia’s is much the largest part, followed by Shylock and
then Bassanio. Antonio is no more prominent in the dialogue than his
friends Gratiano and Lorenzo. The part almost seems to be deliberately
under-written. ‘In sooth I know not why I am so sad’, he begins the
play. His friends suggest some possible reasons: he is worried about his
merchandise or perhaps he is in love. Antonio denies both, proposing
instead that to play the melancholy man is simply his given role in the
theatre of the world. Intriguingly, Shakespeare gives the name Antonio
to discontented characters in two other plays: one is Sebastian’s
nautical companion in Twelfth Night , who risks his life for his close
friend only to be ignored when Sebastian finds the love of a good woman,
and the other is Prospero’s usurping brother in The Tempest , who has no
wife or child of his own and who is again marginalized at the end of the
play. Some productions have explored the sense of exclusion associated
with the Antonio figures in Merchant and Twelfth Night by suggesting
that they are made melancholy by unrequited homoerotic desire for,
respectively, Bassanio and Sebastian.</p>
<p>Shakespeare often returned to a triangular structure of relationships
in which close male friendship is placed at odds with desire for a
woman. The pattern recurs not only in several of the plays but also as
the implied narrative of the Sonnets. The Merchant of Venice begins with
Bassanio seeking to borrow from his friend in order to finance the
pursuit of a wealthy lover. He sets himself up as a figure from
classical mythology: Jason in pursuit of the Golden Fleece. The analogy
establishes Gratiano and Lorenzo as fellow-Argonauts. Jason was renowned
for being clever and brave, but also selfish and materialistic. His
pattern of behaviour was to gain the assistance of a woman – Ariadne,
Medea – in realizing his ambitions, to become her lover and then to
desert her and move on to a new adventure. With Jason as his role model,
Bassanio has the potential to join the company of those other lovers in
Shakespearean comedy – Claudio in Much Ado about Nothing , Bertram in
All’s Well that Ends Well – who are not worthy of the women they
obtain.</p>
<p>To make such comparisons is to see that The Merchant of Venice is one
of Shakespeare’s darker comedies. The blurring of perspectives between
the romantic and the sinister is especially apparent in the beautiful
but ironic love-duet of Lorenzo and Jessica at the beginning of the
final act. They compare themselves to some oft-sung partners from the
world of classical mythology. But what kind of exemplary figures are
these? Cressida, who was unfaithful to Troilus; Medea the poisoner;
Thisbe, whose tragical fate, though comically represented in the
mechanicals’ play in A Midsummer Night’s Dream , was identical to
Juliet’s; and Dido, whom Aeneas deserted in his quest for imperial
glory. They are all figures in the pantheon of tragedy, not comedy.</p>
<p>The cleverness that Bassanio shares with the mythological figure of
Jason is apparent from his choice of casket. Portia’s late father has
devised a simple test to find her the right husband: those suitors who
choose the golden or silver caskets are clearly motivated by desire for
wealth and must therefore want to marry her for her money. The man who
chooses lead obviously does not care about cash, so he is likely to love
Portia for herself alone. Bassanio, however, recognizes that appearances
are not to be trusted. Venice, sixteenth-century Europe’s pre-eminent
city of commercial exchange and conspicuous consumption, has taught him
that credit allows a man to display himself above his means. He does not
want to look like a fortune hunter when wooing Portia, so he borrows
from Antonio in order to dress like a wealthy man: ‘By something showing
a more swelling port / Than my faint means would grant continuance.’ He
chooses the lead casket because he knows from his own example that
‘outward shows’ may be least themselves and that the world is easily
deceived ‘with ornament’. Gold, he reasons, is for greedy Midas, so he
spurns it – this is what he imagines Portia wants to hear. He is of
course assisted by the hint she drops for his benefit: whereas Morocco
and Aragon had to make their choice in silence, Bassanio’s is heralded
by a song that warns against trusting what appears to ‘the eyes’.</p>
<p>Portia has been attracted to Bassanio for some time (he has
previously visited Belmont in the guise of ‘a scholar and a soldier’ in
the retinue of another suitor), but it is when he reasons against gold
that love takes her over, banishing all other emotions. She responds
with a beautifully articulated selfrevelation. Ignore my riches,
virtues, beauty, status, she says: ‘the full sum of me / Is sum of
nothing, which to term in gross / Is an unlessoned girl, unschooled,
unpractisèd.’ On the surface, the rural estate of Belmont (literally
‘beautiful mountain’) is the play’s version of pastoral: an Arcadian
realm of ease, integrity and self-discovery that stands in contrast to
the hard-nosed commerce of the duplicitous city. But the lesson of
Belmont is actually a cynical one: choose wealth and you won’t get it,
appear to reject it and it will be yours. The Prince of Morocco, who
takes things at face value, is roundly rejected. It will not be the last
time that Shakespeare pits an honest Moor against a world of Italian
intrigue.</p>
<p>For all their fine words, both Bassanio and Portia are engaged in
‘practice’, a word that the Elizabethans associated with the figure of
Machiavelli, archetypal Italianate schemer for selfadvancement. Bassanio
is the gold-digger he pretends not to be, while Portia has no intention
of letting any man become ‘her lord, her governor, her king’ in the way
that she says she will. At the end of her submission speech, she gives
Bassanio the ring (symbol of both wealth and marital union) that will
later be the device whereby she tricks him and thus establishes her
position as the dominant partner in the relationship. She may speak
about giving him all her property – which is what marriage meant
according to the law of the time – but when she returns from Venice to
Belmont at the end of the play she continues to speak of ‘my house’ and
the light ‘burning in my hall’.</p>
<p>As for Portia’s claim that she is ‘unlessoned’ and ‘unschooled’, this
is wholly belied by her bravura performance in the cross-dressed role of
Balthasar, interpreting the laws of Venice with forensic skill that
reduces the duke and his magnificoes to amazement. On leaving Belmont,
she says that she and Nerissa will remain in a nunnery, the ultimate
place of female confinement, until Bassanio’s financial difficulties are
resolved. She actually goes to the public arena of the Venetian court,
moving from passive (the woman wooed) to active (the problem-solver). In
the robes of a lawyer instead of those of a nun, she excels in the art
of debate, deploying a rhetorical art calculated to delight Queen
Elizabeth, who loved nothing more than to outmanoeuvre courtiers,
diplomats and suitors in the finer points of jurisprudence and
theology.</p>
<p>‘The quality of mercy is not strained’: the quality of Portia’s
argument (and Shakespeare’s writing) unfolds from the several meanings
of ‘strained’. Mercy is not constrained or forced, it must be freely
given; nor is it partial or selective – it is a pure distillation like
‘the gentle rain from heaven’, not the kind of liquid from which impure
particles can be strained out. As in Measure for Measure , Shakespeare
explores the tension between justice and mercy, here interpreted in
terms of the opposition between the Old Testament Jewish law of ‘an eye
for an eye’ and Christ’s New Testament covenant of forgiveness. When
Shylock refuses to show mercy and stands by the old covenant, Portia’s
art is to throw his legal literalism back in his face: the corollary of
his demand for an exact pound of flesh is that he should not spill a
drop of Venetian blood. But if the quality of mercy is not strained,
then neither should be that of conversion: a bitter taste is left when
Shylock is constrained to become a Christian.</p>
<p>Commerce, with which Venice was synonymous, depends on borrowing to
raise capital. Christianity, however, disapproved of usury, the lending
of money with interest. The Jewish moneylender was early modern Europe’s
way out of this impasse. Venice was famous for its ghetto in which the
Jews were constrained to live, even as they oiled the wheels of the
city’s economy. Shakespeare does not mention the ghetto, but he reveals
a clear understanding of how the system worked when Shylock refuses
Antonio’s invitation to dinner: ‘I will buy with you, sell with you,
talk with you, walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat with
you, drink with you, nor pray with you.’ There is sociability and
commerce between different ethnic and religious groups, but spiritual
practices and customs are kept distinct. Shylock will not go to dinner
because his religion prevents him from eating pork, but ultimately he
regards questions of business as more important than those of faith: he
hates Antonio ‘for he is a Christian, / But more, for that in low
simplicity / He lends out money gratis and brings down / The rate of
usance here with us in Venice.’</p>
<p>It is the Christians who act according to raw prejudice. Shylock is
spat upon simply because he is a Jew. Barabas, the Jew of Malta in the
play written by Marlowe a few years before, answers to the stereotype of
the Jew in love with his money-bags (though he does also love his
daughter), whereas Shylock famously appeals to a common humanity that
extends across the ethnic divide:</p>
<p>He hath disgraced me, and hindered me half a million, laughed at my
losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains,
cooled my friends, heated mine enemies, and what’s the reason? I am a
Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions,
senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same
weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed
and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If you
prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you
poison us, do we not die?</p>
<p>In Elizabethan England the test for a witch was the pricking of her
thumb: if it did not bleed, the woman was in league with the devil.
Shylock’s ‘If you prick us, do we not bleed?’ is a way of saying ‘do not
demonize the Jews – we are not like witches’. ‘The villainy you teach me
I will execute’, he continues: if you do demonize me, then I will behave
diabolically. The alien, the oppressed minority, sees no alternative but
to fight back: ‘And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?’ This is the
point of parting between the Jewish law of ‘an eye for an eye’ and the
Christian notion of turning the other cheek and showing the quality of
mercy.</p>
<p>The representation of Shylock as monstrous villain has played a part
in the appalling history of European anti-Semitism. But such a
representation necessarily occludes the subtler moments of Shakespeare’s
characterization. A ring is not only the device whereby Portia and
Nerissa assert their moral and verbal superiority over their husbands,
but also the means by which Shylock is humanized through the memory of
his dead wife:</p>
<p>TUBAL One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a
monkey.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise,
I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a
wilderness of monkeys.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Antonio, the merchant of Venice, lends three thousand ducats to
his friend Bassanio in order to assist him in his wooing of the wealthy
and beautiful Portia of Belmont, an estate some distance from Venice.
But Antonio’s own money is tied up in business ventures that depend on
the safe return of his ships from sea, so he borrows the money from
Shylock, a Jewish moneylender whom he has previously insulted for his
high rates of interest. Shylock lends the money against a bond whereby
failure to repay the loan on the agreed date will entitle Shylock to a
pound of Antonio’s flesh. Portia’s father has decreed that she will
marry whichever suitor makes the correct choice when presented with
three caskets, made of gold, silver and lead. Where wealthy suitors from
Morocco and Aragon fail, Bassanio succeeds by choosing lead. His friend
Gratiano marries Portia’s lady-in-waiting Nerissa at the same time. News
arrives that Antonio’s ships have been lost; he is unable to pay his
debt. Shylock’s claim to his pound of flesh is heard in the law court
before the duke. Unknown to their husbands, Portia disguises herself as
a young male lawyer acting on behalf of Antonio, Nerissa as a clerk.
Portia’s ingenious defence is that Shylock is entitled to his pound of
flesh but not to spill any of Antonio’s blood; she argues that the Jew
should forfeit his life for having conspired against the life of a
Venetian. The duke pardons Shylock on condition that he gives half his
wealth to Antonio and half to the state. Antonio surrenders his claim on
condition that Shylock converts to Christianity and leaves his property
to his daughter Jessica, whom he has disinherited for running away with
her Christian lover Lorenzo. Portia and Nerissa then assert their power
over Bassanio and Gratiano by means of a trick involving rings that the
men have promised never to part with. Finally there is good news about
Antonio’s ships.</p>

<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 80% verse, 20% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: Registered for publication July 1598 and mentioned in Francis
Meres’ 1598 list of Shakespeare’s comedies; reference to a ship called
the Andrew suggests late 1596 or early 1597, when the Spanish vessel St
Andrew , which had been captured at Cadiz after running aground, was
much in the news. ·</p>
<p>SOURCES: There are many ancient and medieval folk variations on the
motif of a body part demanded as surety for a bond. The setting of the
story in Venice, the pursuit of ‘the lady of Belmonte’ as the reason the
hero needs the money, the bond being made by a friend rather than the
hero himself, the identification of the moneylender as a Jew, and the
lady disguising herself as a male lawyer, coming to Venice and arguing
that the bond does not allow for the shedding of blood all come from a
tale in Ser Giovanni Fiorentino’s collection Il Pecorone (‘The Dunce’,
in Italian, published 1558 – no English translation). A lost English
play of the 1570s called The Jew may have been an intervening source.
The character of Shylock and the elopement of his daughter with a
Christian are strongly shaped by Christopher Marlowe’s highly successful
play The Jew of Malta (c.1590). The choice between three caskets as a
device to identify a worthy marriage partner is another ancient motif;
the closest surviving precedent is a story in the medieval Gesta
Romanorum (translated by Richard Robinson, 1577, revised 1595 with use
of the rare word ‘insculpt’, which is echoed in Morocco’s speech).</p>
<p>TEXT: Quarto 1600: a good quality text, apparently set from a fair
copy of the dramatist’s manuscript; reprinted 1619, with some errors and
some corrections. Folio text was set from a copy of the first Quarto,
making some corrections, introducing some errors and apparently drawing
on a theatrical manuscript for stage directions, including music cues.
We follow Folio where it corrects or modernizes Quarto, but restore
Quarto where Folio changes appear to be printers’ errors. The only
serious textual problem concerns the Venetian gentlemen known in the
theatrical profession as the ‘Salads’. They are initially identified in
entry directions and speech headings as ‘Salarino’ and ‘Solanio’
(variously abbreviated, most commonly to ‘Sal.’ and ‘Sol.’), but never
named in the dialogue, so are unidentified from the point of view of a
theatre audience. Folio reverses their speech headings at the beginning
of the opening scene, probably erroneously. In Act 3 scene 2 ‘Salerio’
arrives in Belmont as ‘a messenger from Venice’; he is named in the
dialogue, so identifiable to the audience. Is this a third character, a
composite of the first two, or – more probably – has Shakespeare
forgotten that he began with ‘Salarino’? In the following scene, Quarto
has ‘Salerio’ back in Venice with Antonio and Shylock, which must be an
error – he has only just exited from Belmont with Bassanio. Folio
intelligently corrects the Act 3 scene 3 entry direction to ‘Solanio’.
In Act 4 scene 1, ‘Salerio’ has returned with Bassanio. Some editions
and productions have retained Salarino, Solanio and Salerio, but it
seems more likely that Salarino and Salerio are intended to be the same
character: we have followed this assumption.</p>
