<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-4-509">Scene 1 ／ running scene 4 509</h4>
<p>Enter two Gentlemen at several 510 doors</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Whither away so fast?</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN O, God save ye:</p>
<p>Ev’n to the hall 511 , to hear what shall become</p>
<p>Of the great Duke of Buckingham.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN I’ll save you</p>
<p>That labour, sir. All’s now done but the ceremony</p>
<p>Of bringing back the prisoner.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Were you there?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes, indeed was I.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Pray speak what has happened.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN You may guess quickly what.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Is he found guilty?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes, truly is he, and condemned upon’t.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN I am sorry for’t.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN So are a number more.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN But pray, how passed it 512 ?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN I’ll tell you in a little 513 . The great duke</p>
<p>Came to the bar, where to his accusations 514</p>
<p>He pleaded still 515 not guilty, and alleged 516</p>
<p>Many sharp reasons to defeat the law 517 .</p>
<p>The king’s attorney, on the contrary,</p>
<p>Urged on the examinations 518 , proofs 519 , confessions</p>
<p>Of divers 520 witnesses, which the duke desired</p>
<p>To him brought 521 viva voce 522 to his face:</p>
<p>At which appeared against him his surveyor,</p>
<p>Sir Gilbert Perk his chancellor, and John Car,</p>
<p>Confessor to him, with that devil monk,</p>
<p>Hopkins, that made this mischief.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN That was he</p>
<p>That fed him with his prophecies.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN The same:</p>
<p>All these accused him strongly, which he fain 523</p>
<p>Would have flung from him, but indeed he could not:</p>
<p>And so his peers, upon this evidence,</p>
<p>Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</p>
<p>He spoke, and learnedly, for life, but all</p>
<p>Was either pitied in him 524 or forgotten 525 .</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN After all this, how did he bear himself?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN When he was brought again to th’bar, to hear</p>
<p>His knell 526 rung out, his judgement, he was stirred</p>
<p>With such an agony, he sweat 527 extremely,</p>
<p>And something spoke in choler 528 , ill 529 and hasty:</p>
<p>But he fell to 530 himself again, and sweetly</p>
<p>In all the rest showed a most noble patience.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN I do not think he fears death.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Sure he does not:</p>
<p>He never was so womanish: the cause</p>
<p>He may a little grieve at.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Certainly</p>
<p>The cardinal is the end 531 of this.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN ’Tis likely</p>
<p>By all conjectures: first, Kildare’s attainder 532 ,</p>
<p>Then deputy 533 of Ireland, who, removed,</p>
<p>Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,</p>
<p>Lest he should help his father 534 .</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN That trick of state 535</p>
<p>Was a deep envious 536 one.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN At his 537 return</p>
<p>No doubt he will requite 538 it: this is noted,</p>
<p>And generally 539 , whoever the king favours,</p>
<p>The card’nal instantly will find employment,</p>
<p>And far enough from court too.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN All the commons</p>
<p>Hate him perniciously 540 and, o’my conscience,</p>
<p>Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much</p>
<p>They love and dote on, call him ’bounteous Buckingham,</p>
<p>The mirror 541 of all courtesy’—</p>
<p>Enter Buckingham from his arraignment, Tipstaves 542 before him, the
axe with the edge towards him 543 , Halberds 544 on each side,
accompanied with Sir Thomas Lovell, Sir Nicholas Vaux, Sir William
Sands, and Common People etc.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Stay there, sir,</p>
<p>And see the noble ruined man you speak of.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Let’s stand close 545 and behold him.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM All good people,</p>
<p>You that thus far have come to pity me:</p>
<p>Hear what I say, and then go home and lose 546 me.</p>
<p>I have this day received a traitor’s judgement 547 ,</p>
<p>And by that name must die: yet heaven bear witness,</p>
<p>And if I have a conscience, let it sink 548 me,</p>
<p>Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful.</p>
<p>The law I bear no malice for my death,</p>
<p>’T has done upon the premises 549 , but justice:</p>
<p>But those that sought it I could wish more 550 Christians:</p>
<p>Be what they will, I heartily forgive ’em:</p>
<p>Yet let ’em look 551 they glory not in mischief,</p>
<p>Nor build their evils 552 on the graves of great men,</p>
<p>For then my guiltless blood must cry against ’em.</p>
<p>For further life in this world I ne’er hope,</p>
<p>Nor will I sue 553 , although the king have mercies</p>
<p>More than I dare make faults 554 . You few that loved me,</p>
<p>And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,</p>
<p>His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave</p>
<p>Is only bitter to him, only dying 555 :</p>
<p>Go with me like good angels to my end,</p>
<p>And as the long divorce of steel 556 falls on me,</p>
<p>Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice 557 ,</p>
<p>And lift my soul to heaven.— Lead on, i’God’s name.</p>
<p>To Lovell</p>
<p>LOVELL I do beseech your grace, for charity,</p>
<p>If ever any malice in your heart</p>
<p>Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you</p>
<p>As I would be forgiven: I forgive all.</p>
<p>There cannot be those numberless offences</p>
<p>Gainst me that I cannot take 558 peace with: no black envy 559</p>
<p>Shall make my grave. Commend me to his grace:</p>
<p>And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him</p>
<p>You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers</p>
<p>Yet 560 are the king’s, and, till my soul forsake 561 ,</p>
<p>Shall cry for blessings on him. May he live</p>
<p>Longer than I have time to tell 562 his years:</p>
<p>Ever beloved and loving may his rule be:</p>
<p>And when old time 563 shall lead him to his end,</p>
<p>Goodness and he fill up one monument 564 .</p>
<p>LOVELL To th’water-side I must conduct your grace,</p>
<p>Then give my charge 565 up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,</p>
<p>Who undertakes 566 you to your end.</p>
<p>VAUX Prepare there,</p>
<p>The duke is coming: see the barge be ready,</p>
<p>And fit it with such furniture 567 as suits</p>
<p>The greatness of his person.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Nay, Sir Nicholas,</p>
<p>Let it alone: my state 568 now will but mock me.</p>
<p>When I came hither, I was Lord High Constable</p>
<p>And Duke of Buckingham: now, poor Edward Bohun:</p>
<p>Yet I am richer than my base 569 accusers,</p>
<p>That never knew what truth 570 meant. I now seal 571 it,</p>
<p>And with that blood will make ’em one day groan for’t.</p>
<p>My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,</p>
<p>Who first raised head 572 against usurping Richard 573 ,</p>
<p>Flying for succour to his servant Banister,</p>
<p>Being distressed, was by that wretch betrayed,</p>
<p>And without trial fell: God’s peace be with him.</p>
<p>Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying</p>
<p>My father’s loss, like a most royal prince,</p>
<p>Restored me to my honours, and out of ruins</p>
<p>Made my name once more noble. Now his son,</p>
<p>Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all</p>
<p>That made me happy, at one stroke 574 has taken</p>
<p>For ever from the world. I had my trial,</p>
<p>And must needs say a noble one, which makes me</p>
<p>A little happier 575 than my wretched father:</p>
<p>Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both</p>
<p>Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most:</p>
<p>A most unnatural and faithless service.</p>
<p>Heaven has an end 576 in all: yet, you that hear me,</p>
<p>This from a dying man receive as certain 577 :</p>
<p>Where you are liberal of 578 your loves and counsels,</p>
<p>Be sure you be not loose 579 : for those you make friends</p>
<p>And give your hearts to, when they once perceive</p>
<p>The least rub 580 in your fortunes, fall away</p>
<p>Like water from ye, never found again</p>
<p>But 581 where they mean to sink ye. All good people,</p>
<p>Pray for me. I must now forsake ye: the last hour</p>
<p>Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:</p>
<p>And when you would say something that is sad,</p>
<p>Speak how I fell. I have done, and God forgive me.</p>
<p>Exeunt Duke and train</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN O, this is full of pity. Sir, it calls,</p>
<p>I fear, too many curses on their heads</p>
<p>That were the authors 582 .</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN If the duke be guiltless,</p>
<p>’Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inkling</p>
<p>Of an ensuing evil, if it fall 583 ,</p>
<p>Greater than this.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Good angels keep it from us.</p>
<p>What may it be? You do not doubt my faith 584 , sir?</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN This secret is so weighty, ’twill require</p>
<p>A strong faith to conceal it.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Let me have it:</p>
<p>I do not talk much.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN I am confident 585 :</p>
<p>You shall 586 , sir: did you not of late 587 days hear</p>
<p>A buzzing 588 of a separation</p>
<p>Between the king and Katherine?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes, but it held not 589 :</p>
<p>For when the king once heard it, out of anger</p>
<p>He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight 590</p>
<p>To stop the rumour, and allay 591 those tongues</p>
<p>That durst disperse it.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN But that slander, sir,</p>
<p>Is found a truth now: for it grows again</p>
<p>Fresher than e’er it was, and held for 592 certain</p>
<p>The king will venture at it 593 . Either the cardinal,</p>
<p>Or some about him near 594 , have, out of malice</p>
<p>To the good queen, possessed him with a scruple 595</p>
<p>That will undo her: to confirm this too,</p>
<p>Cardinal Campeius 596 is arrived, and lately,</p>
<p>As all think, for this business.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN ’Tis the cardinal:</p>
<p>And merely to revenge him on the emperor 597</p>
<p>For not bestowing on him at his asking</p>
<p>The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed 598 .</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN I think you have hit the mark 599 : but is’t not
cruel</p>
<p>That she should feel the smart 600 of this? The cardinal</p>
<p>Will have his will, and she must fall.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN ’Tis woeful.</p>
<p>We are too open 601 here to argue this:</p>
<p>Let’s think in private more.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
