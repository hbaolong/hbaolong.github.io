742</h4>
<p>Enter Mercutio, Benvolio and Men</p>
<p>BENVOLIO I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:</p>
<p>The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,</p>
<p>And if we meet, we shall not scape 743 a brawl,</p>
<p>For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Thou art like one of these fellows that when he enters the
confines of a tavern, claps me 744 his sword upon the table and says
‘God send me no need of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup
745 draws him on the drawer 746 , when indeed there is no need.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Am I like such a fellow?</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack 747 in thy mood 748 as
any in Italy, and as soon moved 749 two to be 750 moody, and as soon
moody to be moved.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO And what to?</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Nay, an there were two 751 such, we should have none
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with
a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason
but because thou hast hazel eyes: what eye but such an eye would spy out
such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat 752 , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle 753 as an egg for
quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street,
because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun: didst
thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet 754 before
Easter 755 ? With another for tying his new shoes with old ribbon. And
yet thou wilt tutor me from 756 quarrelling?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy
the fee-simple 757 of my life for an hour and a quarter 758 .</p>
<p>MERCUTIO The fee-simple? O, simple 759 !</p>
<p>Enter Tybalt, Petruchio and others</p>
<p>BENVOLIO By my head, here comes the Capulets.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO By my heel, I care not.</p>
<p>TYBALT Follow me close, for I will speak to them.—</p>
<p>To his companions</p>
<p>Gentlemen, good e’en, a word with one of you.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something,
make it a word and a blow.</p>
<p>TYBALT You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
occasion.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Could you not take some occasion without giving?</p>
<p>TYBALT Mercutio, thou consort’st 760 with Romeo—</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels 761 ? An thou
make minstrels of us, look 762 to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my
fiddlestick, here’s that shall make you dance. Come, consort!</p>
<p>Points to his sword</p>
<p>BENVOLIO We talk here in the public haunt of men:</p>
<p>Either withdraw unto some private place,</p>
<p>Or reason coldly 763 of your grievances,</p>
<p>Or else depart: here all eyes gaze on us.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Men’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze:</p>
<p>I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.</p>
<p>Enter Romeo</p>
<p>TYBALT Well, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery 764 .</p>
<p>Marry, go before to field 765 , he’ll be your follower 766 :</p>
<p>Your worship in that sense may call him ‘man’.</p>
<p>TYBALT Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford</p>
<p>No better term than this: thou art a villain.</p>
<p>ROMEO Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee</p>
<p>Doth much excuse the appertaining rage</p>
<p>To such a greeting 767 : villain am I none;</p>
<p>Therefore farewell, I see thou know’st me not.</p>
<p>TYBALT Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries</p>
<p>That thou hast done me: therefore turn and draw.</p>
<p>ROMEO I do protest I never injured thee,</p>
<p>But love thee better than thou canst devise 768 ,</p>
<p>Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:</p>
<p>And so, good Capulet — which name I tender 769</p>
<p>As dearly as my own — be satisfied.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!</p>
<p>Alla stoccado 770 carries it away 771 .</p>
<p>Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk 772 ?</p>
<p>Draws his sword</p>
<p>TYBALT What wouldst thou have with me?</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives that I
mean to make bold withal 773 , and as you shall use me hereafter 774 ,
dry-beat 775 the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his
pilcher 776 by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it
be out.</p>
<p>TYBALT I am for you.</p>
<p>Draws</p>
<p>ROMEO Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Come, sir, your passado 777 .</p>
<p>They fight</p>
<p>ROMEO Draw, Benvolio, beat down their weapons.—</p>
<p>Gentlemen, for shame, forbear 778 this outrage!</p>
<p>Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath</p>
<p>Tries to part them</p>
<p>Forbidden bandying 779 in Verona streets:</p>
<p>Hold 780 , Tybalt! Good Mercutio!</p>
<p>Tybalt stabs Mercutio</p>
<p>Exit Tybalt</p>
<p>MERCUTIO I am hurt.</p>
<p>A plague o’both the houses! I am sped 781 .</p>
<p>Is he gone and hath nothing?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO What, art thou hurt?</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch, marry, ’tis enough.</p>
<p>Where is my page? Go, villain 782 , fetch a surgeon.</p>
<p>[Exit Page ]</p>
<p>ROMEO Courage, man, the hurt cannot be much.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO No, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church
door, but ’tis enough, ’twill serve: ask for me tomorrow, and you shall
find me a grave 783 man. I am peppered 784 , I warrant, for this world.
A plague o’both your houses! What? A dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to
scratch a man to death! A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by
the book of arithmetic 785 !— Why the devil came you between us? I was
hurt under your arm.</p>
<p>To Romeo</p>
<p>ROMEO I thought all for the best.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Help me into some house, Benvolio,</p>
<p>Or I shall faint. A plague o’both your houses!</p>
<p>They have made worms’ meat of me. I have it,</p>
<p>And soundly too. Your houses!</p>
<p>Exeun</p>
<p>Benvolio helping</p>
<p>ROMEO This gentleman, the prince’s near ally 786 ,</p>
<p>Mercutio</p>
<p>My very 787 friend, hath got his mortal hurt</p>
<p>In my behalf: my reputation stained</p>
<p>With Tybalt’s slander — Tybalt, that an hour</p>
<p>Hath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,</p>
<p>Thy beauty hath made me effeminate,</p>
<p>And in my temper 788 softened valour’s steel!</p>
<p>Enter Benvolio</p>
<p>BENVOLIO O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!</p>
<p>That gallant spirit hath aspired 789 the clouds,</p>
<p>Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.</p>
<p>ROMEO This day’s black fate on more 790 days doth depend 791 ,</p>
<p>This but begins the woe others 792 must end.</p>
<p>Enter Tybalt</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.</p>
<p>ROMEO He gone in triumph and Mercutio slain?</p>
<p>Away to heaven, respective lenity 793 ,</p>
<p>And fire and fury be my conduct 794 now!</p>
<p>Now, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again,</p>
<p>That late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul</p>
<p>Is but a little way above our heads,</p>
<p>Staying for thine to keep him company:</p>
<p>Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.</p>
<p>TYBALT Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort 795 him here,</p>
<p>Shalt with him hence.</p>
<p>ROMEO This 796 shall determine that.</p>
<p>They fight. Tybalt falls</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Romeo, away, begone!</p>
<p>The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.</p>
<p>Stand not amazed 797 : the prince will doom 798 thee death,</p>
<p>If thou art taken. Hence, begone, away!</p>
<p>ROMEO O, I am fortune’s fool 799 !</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Why dost thou stay?</p>
<p>Exit Romeo</p>
<p>Enter Citizens</p>
<p>CITIZEN Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?</p>
<p>Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO There lies that Tybalt.</p>
<p>CITIZEN Up, sir, go with me:</p>
<p>I charge 800 thee in the prince’s name, obey.</p>
<p>Enter Prince, Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives and all</p>
<p>PRINCE Where are the vile beginners of this fray?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO O, noble prince, I can discover 801 all</p>
<p>The unlucky 802 manage 803 of this fatal 804 brawl:</p>
<p>There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,</p>
<p>That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET Tybalt, my cousin 805 ? O my brother’s child!</p>
<p>O prince! O cousin! Husband! O, the blood is spilled</p>
<p>Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,</p>
<p>For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.</p>
<p>O cousin, cousin!</p>
<p>PRINCE Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay.</p>
<p>Romeo that spoke him fair, bid him bethink</p>
<p>How nice 806 the quarrel was, and urged withal 807</p>
<p>Your high displeasure: all this utterèd</p>
<p>With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed,</p>
<p>Could not take truce 808 tilts with the unruly spleen 809</p>
<p>Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts 810</p>
<p>With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,</p>
<p>Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,</p>
<p>And with a martial scorn, with one hand beats</p>
<p>Cold death aside, and with the other 811 sends</p>
<p>It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity</p>
<p>Retorts 812 it. Romeo he cries aloud,</p>
<p>‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,</p>
<p>His agile arm beats down their fatal points,</p>
<p>And ’twixt them rushes, underneath whose arm</p>
<p>An envious 813 thrust from Tybalt hit the life</p>
<p>Of stout 814 Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.</p>
<p>But by and by 815 comes back to Romeo,</p>
<p>Who had but newly entertained revenge,</p>
<p>And to’t they go like lightning, for, ere I</p>
<p>Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.</p>
<p>And as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.</p>
<p>This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET He is a kinsman to the Montague,</p>
<p>Affection 816 makes him false, he speaks not true:</p>
<p>Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,</p>
<p>And all those twenty could but kill one life.</p>
<p>I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give:</p>
<p>Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.</p>
<p>PRINCE Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio:</p>
<p>Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?</p>
<p>MONTAGUE Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio’s friend:</p>
<p>His fault concludes but what the law should end,</p>
<p>The life of Tybalt.</p>
<p>PRINCE And for that offence</p>
<p>Immediately we do exile him hence.</p>
<p>I have an interest 817 in your hearts’ proceeding 818 ,</p>
<p>My blood 819 for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding:</p>
<p>But I’ll amerce 820 you with so strong a fine</p>
<p>That you shall all repent the loss of mine.</p>
<p>It will be deaf to pleading and excuses,</p>
<p>Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses 821 :</p>
<p>Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,</p>
<p>Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.</p>
<p>Bear hence this body and attend our will:</p>
<p>Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill 822 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
