to Introduction to Love’s Labour’s Lost</h4>
<p>Love’s Labour’s Lost is a play for Shakespeare connoisseurs. It is a
great feast of linguistic sophistication on the theme of the inadequacy
of linguistic sophistication. It is full of poetry – and mockery of
poetry. Its preposterous academic posturing is either hilarious or
incomprehensible, according to the disposition of the listener. Some of
its jokes and puns are now so obscure that a modern audience frequently
finds itself in the position of Dull, listening in bemusement as the
others plan their play: ‘Via, Goodman Dull!’ says Holofernes, ‘Thou hast
spoken no word all this while.’ To which the simple constable replies
‘Nor understood none neither, sir.’</p>
<p>The play was a favourite for the sophisticated audience at court –
Queen Elizabeth herself would have greatly enjoyed not only the
authority, wit and hunting skills of the princess, but also the ‘sweet
smoke of rhetoric’ in the elaborate speechifying of the male courtiers
and the wordy academic humour of Holofernes and Don Armado. The reaction
of the general theatre-going public – ‘the base vulgar’, as the play
itself calls them – might have been more like that of Dull. It comes as
no surprise that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries this was
Shakespeare’s least-performed play. Its minimal plot, intellectual
rigour and architectural symmetry make it seem to belong to some genre
far from the popular theatre – Enlightenment opera buffa , perhaps.
There are, indeed, remarkable thematic and structural resemblances to
Mozart and Da Ponte’s Così fan tutte . A Paris production of 1863
actually merged the two works, combining Mozart’s music with a text
based on Shakespeare. In the following century, W. H. Auden and his
lover collaborated with Vladimir Nabokov’s cousin on an operatic version
of the play, perhaps inspired by the fictional composer Leverkühn in
Thomas Mann’s novel Doctor Faustus , whose only opera is a setting of
Love’s Labour’s ‘in a spirit of the most artificial mockery and parody
of the artificial: something highly playful and highly precious’.</p>
<p>Dr Samuel Johnson thought that Love’s Labour’s was one of the most
Shakespearean of Shakespeare’s plays. Like the characters of Berowne and
Boyet, who dislike each other because they are so like each other,
Shakespeare was famous for his verbal facility, for being
‘honey-tongued’. In no other play does he so fully indulge his gift for
‘Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise, / Three-piled hyperboles, spruce
affectation, / Figures pedantical.’ At the same time, in no other play
does he so mercilessly expose that gift as a fly-blown form of ‘maggot
ostentation’, ripe for renunciation in favour of those ‘honest plain
words’ that ‘best pierce the ear of grief’. What is so Shakespearean is
this way of having it both ways. ‘Taffeta phrases’ are ostentatiously
rejected and yet the simple rustic language that supposedly replaces
them is equally thick with allusion (or, as Dull has it, ‘collusion’ and
‘pollution’). Berowne’s ‘russet yeas and honest kersey noes’ puns on
‘eyes’ and ‘nose’, so reintroducing the figure of Ovid, surnamed Naso
(Latin for ‘nose’), who is not only Holofernes’ but also Shakespeare’s
master in the art of verbal pyrotechnics. For ‘the elegancy, facility,
and golden cadence of poesy’, ‘Ovidius Naso was the man: and why
indeed’‘Naso’‘, but for smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy,
the jerks of invention?’</p>
<p>Ovid taught Shakespeare how to write love poetry but also how to
parody love poetry. If ladies are conventionally praised for being
blonde and pale-skinned, Ovid and Shakespeare know how to offer
paradoxical praise of black. Where lesser poets catalogue the body parts
of the beloved in smoothly predictable blazons (blue eyes, creamy
breasts), Ovid and Shakespeare turn the convention on its head: ‘two
pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes’ and a piercing glare not at the
bosom but at the dark place between the legs. Though Dr Johnson was too
polite to say so, one of the reasons why Love’s Labour’s is Shakespeare
at his most Shakespearean is that it is simultaneously one of his most
elegant plays (rivalled only by As You Like It ) and his most filthy
(rivalled only by Troilus and Cressida ). The exchange in the fourth act
concerning prickets, shooting, sores, ells and sorrels is on the surface
about deer-hunting, but beneath the veneer it alludes unmistakably to
inflamed genitalia and sexually transmitted disease.</p>
<p>At the climax of the play, the mood changes with the entrance of
Marcadé, ambassador of death. Immediately before his entrance, the
play-within-the-play has dissolved into a brawl between a clown and a
braggart knight on the subject of a pregnant dairymaid who is named
after the Elizabethan term for a toilet. The knight is accused of
wearing a ‘dishclout’ of the maid’s as a favour next to his heart. A
stinking dish cloth is enough to prick the bubble of chivalric romance,
but the word also seems to have been a slang term for a rag strapped
over the cleft so as to soak up menstrual blood. To hold that image in
conjunction with the memento mori figure of Marcadé is to understand
something of Shakespeare’s taste for extremity and paradox.</p>
<p>In contrast to those Shakespearean comedies that turn on a movement
between a court and a green world, the play confines itself within the
single location of a court that has turned itself into a green world.
The action all takes place, in a very short time frame and with only a
few (not very short) scenes, within the King of Navarre’s park. The set
up could hardly be simpler. The king and his courtiers have forsworn
love in the name of academic study, but the arrival of the Princess of
France and her charming attendant ladies presents an obstacle to this
plan. Green is the colour associated with retreat to a garden for the
purposes of intellectual contemplation (in his lyric ‘the Garden’, the
poet Andrew Marvell imagined ‘Annihilating all that’s made / To a green
thought in a green shade’). But, as Don Armado comes to realize when
prompted by Moth his clever page, green is also ‘the colour of lovers’.
The play is a demonstration of the triumph of love over intellectual
labour. True wisdom belongs not to the intellectuals but to the clown
Costard, who is of the view that it ‘is the simplicity of man to hearken
after the flesh’. Neither academic aspiration nor poetic elaboration
will save man from this elementary truth.</p>
<p>Being sophisticated, Navarre and his three fellows only learn the
truth by being embarrassed. In the play’s most theatrically effective
scene, plotted like the best of farces, each of the four men is caught
with his metaphoric trousers down – not just falling in love, but
writing abysmal love poetry. George Bernard Shaw summarized the dramatic
effect neatly: ‘No.1 being inaudible to 2, 3 and 4; No.2 audible to
No.1, but not to 3 and 4; No.3 audible to 1 and 2, but not to No.4; and
No.4 audible to all the rest, but himself temporarily stone deaf.’ There
is further delight when the men, now working in unison, disguise
themselves as Russians in order to woo the ladies, but the ladies run
rings round them because the disguise is so easily seen through. At this
point we anticipate an unmasking, universal forgiveness, the forgetting
of foolishness, multiple marriages and everyone living happily ever
after. First, however, the lower-ranked characters must perform a
celebratory entertainment for the court.</p>
<p>Just as ‘The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus
and Thisbe’ echoes the main plot of A Midsummer Night’s Dream , so the
pageant of ‘The Nine Worthies’ offers a commentary on that of Love’s
Labour’s Lost . Navarre begins the main action with the premise that he
and his courtiers will achieve immortal fame by means of their academic
prowess, but, in a striking analogy to the opening sequence of
Shakespeare’s sonnets, the unfolding of the plot suggests that falling
in love and reproducing oneself sexually is the only real means of
guaranteeing survival after death. It is ‘women’s eyes’, not books and
academes, that ‘contain and nourish all the world’. Shakespeare turns
the raw material for his play-within-the-play so that it fits with this
theme. The Nine Worthies were traditionally three figures from each of
the three traditions that constituted Shakespeare’s cultural
inheritance: the Bible (Joshua, David, Judas Maccabaeus), classical
antiquity (Hector of Troy, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar) and the
romances of the Middle Ages (Arthur, Charlemagne, Godfrey of Bouillon).
All nine had achieved immortality by means of heroic military action.
This in itself is a rebuke to the court for its presumption that ‘fame
that all hunt after in their lives’ could come from something so passive
as academic study. At the same time, Shakespeare changes the traditional
cast: Julius Caesar is replaced by Costard as Pompey the Great and, more
significantly, Moth as Hercules stands in for one of the biblical or
medieval figures. This is partly a joke about size: Hercules is the
archetypal big man, whereas Moth is compared to an insect or a dust
particle. In addition, the introduction of Hercules highlights the motif
of heroic endeavour brought low by desire. He was famous not only for
his labours such as stealing golden apples from the garden of the
Hesperides (alluded to in Berowne’s long speech on love near the end of
the fourth act), but also for the losses caused by his loves . Hercules
was humiliated and unmanned by his love for Omphale, then driven mad and
murderous by his desire for Deianira. ‘What great men have been in
love?’ Armado asks Moth. ‘Hercules, master’ comes the reply. The
biblical Samson and his catastrophic love for Delilah is invoked at the
same point. One suspects that if the pageant of Worthies had run to its
conclusion, he too would have muscled his way into the cast.</p>
<p>As in ‘Pyramus and Thisbe’, the noble audience are unnecessarily rude
to the ignoble players. They subvert the illusion on which theatre
depends: ‘I Pompey am –’ ‘You lie, you are not he.’ And they make rude
jokes at the expense of the actors: ‘For the ass to the Jude? Give it
him: Jud-as, away!’ Holofernes engages our hearts when he offers the
dignified response: ‘This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.’ The
lords must undergo a further humbling before they prove their gentility
and gain their reward: after all the linguistic labour, their loves are
not won. Berowne is set the task of moving wild laughter in the throat
of death and, in contrast to the traditional comic ending where Jack
shall have Jill and nought shall go ill, here ‘Jack hath not Jill’.
There is a kind of suspended animation, intended to last for a year,
heralded by the closing song of spring and winter.</p>
<p>With its rhymes and dances, its four pairs of lovers and
curious-knotted garden, the play has a symmetrical structure that seems
to demand harmonious resolution, and yet it ends with interruption – the
unfinished pageant, the unfinished courtship, and finally another
unfinished performance. Armado announces that Holofernes and Nathaniel
will stage an epilogue in the form of an academic dialogue, but we never
get to hear it. The haunting simplicity of the song intended to
introduce their debate brings Armado, the embodiment of verbosity, to
one final rejection of language-feasting: he calls a halt to the show
and dismisses the audiences on-stage and off with the conclusion that
more words would be harsh after such music.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: The King of Navarre and three of his lords form a little
‘academe’ in which they vow to study for three years, renouncing the
company of women. But the Princess of France and three of her ladies
arrive on a diplomatic mission, throwing the plan into chaos as soon as
the vows are made. The men from Navarre trump each other in a scene in
which they are overheard reading aloud their bad love poems. The ladies
then comprehensively outwit the men in a scene involving Russian
disguise. A comic sub-plot concerns an extravagantly spoken Spaniard,
his clever page, a country clown and a pregnant dairymaid, with
contributions from a curate and a pedantic schoolmaster, culminating in
a pageant of classical and biblical heroes, ‘The Nine Worthies’. Halfway
through this show, Marcadé arrives with news of the death of the
princess’ father. The mood turns sombre and the ladies give the men the
task of performing a year’s ascetic penance or community service before
they will marry them.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage) Berowne (22%/ 159/5), King (11%/117/4), Princess (10%/102/3), Don
Armado (10%/102/4), Boyet (8%/80/3), Costard (7%/83/7), Rosaline
(7%/75/3), Holofernes (6%/54/3), Moth (5%/78/3), Dumaine (3%/54/4),
Longaville (2%/40/4), Maria (2%/25/3), Katherine (2%/22/3), Nathaniel
(2%/19/3), Dull (1%/15/4), Jaquenetta (1%/13/3).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 65% verse, 35% prose. High proportion of rhyme and
interwoven poetry, including sonnets.</p>
<p>DATE: Before 1598. Edition of that year refers to the play being
‘presented before her Highness [Queen Elizabeth] this last Christmas’. A
poem by Robert Tofte, also published in 1598, apparently refers to a
performance seen in the public theatre. Stylistic similarity to A
Midsummer Night’s Dream and other lyrical plays, together with possible
references to an Inns of Court Christmas entertainment of 1594–95, lead
most scholars to date composition to 1595–96.</p>
<p>SOURCES: One of Shakespeare’s few genuinely sourceless plays, though
draws on many aspects of the literary culture of the early 1590s
(e.g. the vogue for love sonnets and the elaborate ‘euphuistic’ writing
style pioneered by John Lyly); the idea of four courtiers retreating
from political engagement in order to engage in academic reflection and
philosophical discussion may have been inspired by Pierre de la
Primaudaye’s The French Academy (English translation 1586, reprinted
1589 and 1594). Though not a contemporary political allegory, some of
the names in the play apparently allude to historical figures in
contemporary France and Navarre (of great interest at the time, since in
March 1594 King Henri of Navarre – a discrete kingdom between France and
Spain – converted to Catholicism and became King of France).</p>
<p>TEXT: Quarto edition of 1598, ‘newly corrected and augmented by W.
Shakespere’ – this may imply that there was an earlier Quarto, now lost.
The Folio was printed from the Quarto, making some corrections and
introducing some errors. There are some severe textual tangles,
particularly over characters’ names, where Shakespeare sometimes seems
to have become muddled. Some passages, including Berowne’s crucial long
speech about love at the end of the fourth act, contain repetition that
strongly suggests that the printed text retains elements of
Shakespeare’s first draft as well as the final version: we indicate such
‘first thoughts’ with marginal marks (//).</p>
