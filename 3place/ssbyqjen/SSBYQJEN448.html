<h4 id="scene-1-540-running-scene-6">Scene 1 540 / running scene 6</h4>
<p>Flourish. Enter Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus,
Trebonius, Cinna,Antony, Lepidus, Artemidorus, Publius [Popilius Lena]
and the Soothsayer</p>
<p>CAESAR The Ides of March are come.</p>
<p>To the Soothsayer</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER Ay, Caesar, but not gone.</p>
<p>ARTEMIDORUS Hail, Caesar. Read this schedule 541 .</p>
<p>DECIUS Trebonius doth desire you to o’erread 542 —</p>
<p>At your best leisure — this his humble suit.</p>
<p>ARTEMIDORUS O Caesar, read mine first, for mine’s a suit</p>
<p>That touches Caesar nearer 543 . Read it, great Caesar.</p>
<p>CAESAR What touches us ourself shall be last served 544 .</p>
<p>ARTEMIDORUS Delay not, Caesar, read it instantly.</p>
<p>CAESAR What, is the fellow mad?</p>
<p>PUBLIUS Sirrah 545 , give place 546 .</p>
<p>To Artemidorus</p>
<p>CASSIUS What, urge you your petitions in the street?</p>
<p>Come to the Capitol.</p>
<p>Caesar and his train move on</p>
<p>POPILIUS I wish your enterprise today may thrive.</p>
<p>To Cassius</p>
<p>CASSIUS What enterprise, Popilius?</p>
<p>POPILIUS Fare you well.</p>
<p>Moves toward Caesar</p>
<p>BRUTUS What said Popilius Lena?</p>
<p>CASSIUS He wished today our enterprise might thrive:</p>
<p>I fear our purpose is discoverèd.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Look how he makes to 547 Caesar: mark him.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Casca, be sudden 548 , for we fear prevention 549 .</p>
<p>Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,</p>
<p>Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back 550 ,</p>
<p>For I will slay myself.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Cassius, be constant 551 :</p>
<p>Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes,</p>
<p>For look, he smiles, and Caesar 552 doth not change.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Trebonius knows his time: for look you, Brutus.</p>
<p>He draws Mark Antony out of the way.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Antony and Trebonius ]</p>
<p>DECIUS Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go</p>
<p>Caesar sits?</p>
<p>And presently prefer 553 his suit to Caesar.</p>
<p>BRUTUS He is addressed 554 : press near and second 555 him.</p>
<p>CINNA Casca, you are the first that rears 556 your hand.</p>
<p>CAESAR Are we all ready? What is now amiss</p>
<p>That Caesar and his senate must redress?</p>
<p>METELLUS Most high, most mighty and most puissant 557 Caesar,</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat 558</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>An humble heart—</p>
<p>CAESAR I must prevent thee, Cimber.</p>
<p>These couchings 559 and these lowly courtesies 560</p>
<p>Might fire 561 the blood of ordinary men,</p>
<p>And turn pre-ordinance and first decree 562</p>
<p>Into the lane 563 of children. Be not fond 564</p>
<p>To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood 565</p>
<p>That will be thawed from the true quality 566</p>
<p>With that which melteth fools — I mean sweet 567 words,</p>
<p>Low-crookèd 568 curtsies and base spaniel-fawning 569 .</p>
<p>Thy brother by decree is banishèd:</p>
<p>If thou dost bend and pray 570 and fawn for him,</p>
<p>I spurn 571 thee like a cur 572 out of my way.</p>
<p>Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause 573</p>
<p>Will he be satisfied 574 .</p>
<p>METELLUS Is there no voice more worthy than my own</p>
<p>To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear</p>
<p>For the repealing 575 of my banished brother?</p>
<p>BRUTUS I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may</p>
<p>Have an immediate freedom of repeal 576 .</p>
<p>CAESAR What, Brutus?</p>
<p>CASSIUS Pardon, Caesar: Caesar, pardon.</p>
<p>As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>To beg enfranchisement 577 for Publius Cimber.</p>
<p>CAESAR I could be well moved if I were as you:</p>
<p>If I could pray to move 578 , prayers would move me.</p>
<p>But I am constant as the northern star 579 ,</p>
<p>Of whose true-fixed and resting 580 quality</p>
<p>There is no fellow 581 in the firmament 582 .</p>
<p>The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks 583 ,</p>
<p>They are all fire and every one doth shine:</p>
<p>But there’s but one in all doth hold his place.</p>
<p>So in the world: ’tis furnished well with men,</p>
<p>And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive 584 ;</p>
<p>Yet in the number I do know but one</p>
<p>That unassailable holds on his rank 585 ,</p>
<p>Unshaked of motion 586 . And that I am he,</p>
<p>Let me a little show it, even in this:</p>
<p>That I was constant Cimber should be banished,</p>
<p>And constant do remain to keep him so.</p>
<p>CINNA O Caesar—</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>CAESAR Hence 587 . Wilt thou lift up Olympus 588 ?</p>
<p>DECIUS Great Caesar—</p>
<p>About to kneel</p>
<p>CAESAR Doth not Brutus bootless 589 kneel?</p>
<p>CASCA Speak hands 590 for me!</p>
<p>They stab Caesar</p>
<p>Casca first, Brutus last</p>
<p>CAESAR Et tu, Bruté? 591 — Then fall, Caesar.</p>
<p>Dies</p>
<p>CINNA Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!</p>
<p>Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Some to the common pulpits 592 and cry out</p>
<p>In the ensuing tumult, exeunt all but the conspirators</p>
<p>and Publius</p>
<p>‘Liberty, freedom and enfranchisement!’</p>
<p>BRUTUS People and senators, be not affrighted 593 .</p>
<p>Fly not, stand still: ambition’s debt is paid 594 .</p>
<p>CASCA Go to the pulpit, Brutus.</p>
<p>DECIUS And Cassius too.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Where’s Publius?</p>
<p>CINNA Here, quite confounded with 595 this mutiny 596 .</p>
<p>METELLUS Stand fast 597 together, lest some friend of Caesar’s</p>
<p>Should chance—</p>
<p>BRUTUS Talk not of standing 598 . Publius, good cheer 599 :</p>
<p>There is no harm intended to your person,</p>
<p>Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.</p>
<p>CASSIUS And leave us, Publius, lest that the people,</p>
<p>Rushing on us, should do your age 600 some mischief 601 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS Do so, and let no man abide 602 this deed</p>
<p>But we the doers.</p>
<p>[Exit Publius ]</p>
<p>Enter Trebonius</p>
<p>CASSIUS Where is Antony?</p>
<p>TREBONIUS Fled to his house amazed 603 .</p>
<p>Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run</p>
<p>As 604 it were doomsday.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Fates, we will know your pleasures 605 .</p>
<p>That we shall die we know: ’tis but the time 606</p>
<p>And drawing days out 607 that men stand upon 608 .</p>
<p>CASCA Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life</p>
<p>Cuts off so many years of fearing death.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Grant that, and then is death a benefit:</p>
<p>So are we Caesar’s friends that have abridged</p>
<p>His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,</p>
<p>And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood</p>
<p>Up to the elbows and besmear our swords:</p>
<p>Then walk we forth, even to the market-place 609 ,</p>
<p>They smear their hands and weapons with Caesar’s blood</p>
<p>And waving our red weapons o’er our heads,</p>
<p>Let’s all cry ‘Peace, freedom and liberty!’</p>
<p>CASSIUS Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence</p>
<p>Shall this our lofty scene be acted over 610 ,</p>
<p>In states unborn and accents 611 yet unknown?</p>
<p>BRUTUS How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport</p>
<p>That now on Pompey’s basis 612 lies along 613</p>
<p>No worthier than the dust?</p>
<p>CASSIUS So oft as that shall be,</p>
<p>So often shall the knot 614 of us be called</p>
<p>The men that gave their country liberty.</p>
<p>DECIUS What, shall we forth?</p>
<p>CASSIUS Ay, every man away.</p>
<p>Brutus shall lead, and we will grace 615 his heels</p>
<p>With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.</p>
<p>Enter a Servant</p>
<p>BRUTUS Soft 616 , who comes here? A friend of Antony’s.</p>
<p>SERVANT Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel,</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,</p>
<p>And being prostrate thus he bade me say:</p>
<p>Brutus is noble, wise, valiant and honest 617 ;</p>
<p>Caesar was mighty, bold, royal and loving.</p>
<p>Say I love Brutus and I honour him,</p>
<p>Say I feared 618 Caesar, honoured him and loved him.</p>
<p>If Brutus will vouchsafe 619 that Antony</p>
<p>May safely come to him and be resolved 620</p>
<p>How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,</p>
<p>Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead</p>
<p>So well as Brutus living, but will follow</p>
<p>The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus</p>
<p>Thorough 621 the hazards of this untrod state 622</p>
<p>With all true faith 623 . So says my master Antony.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman:</p>
<p>I never thought him worse.</p>
<p>Tell him, so please him come unto this place,</p>
<p>He shall be satisfied 624 , and by my honour</p>
<p>Depart untouched 625 .</p>
<p>SERVANT I’ll fetch him presently 626 .</p>
<p>Exit Servant</p>
<p>BRUTUS I know that we shall have him well to 627 friend.</p>
<p>CASSIUS I wish 628 we may: but yet have I a mind 629</p>
<p>That fears 630 him much, and my misgiving still</p>
<p>Falls shrewdly 631 to the purpose 632 .</p>
<p>Enter Antony</p>
<p>BRUTUS But here comes Antony.— Welcome, Mark Antony.</p>
<p>ANTONY O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?</p>
<p>To the body</p>
<p>Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils 633 ,</p>
<p>Shrunk to this little measure 634 ? Fare thee well.—</p>
<p>I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,</p>
<p>Who else must be let blood 635 , who else is rank 636 :</p>
<p>If I myself, there is no hour so fit</p>
<p>As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument</p>
<p>Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich</p>
<p>With the most noble blood of all this world.</p>
<p>I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,</p>
<p>Now, whilst your purpled 637 hands do reek 638 and smoke,</p>
<p>Fulfil your pleasure. Live 639 a thousand years,</p>
<p>I shall not find myself so apt 640 to die.</p>
<p>No place will please me so, no mean 641 of death,</p>
<p>As here by Caesar, and by you cut off 642 ,</p>
<p>The choice 643 and master 644 spirits of this age.</p>
<p>BRUTUS O Antony! Beg not your death of us:</p>
<p>Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,</p>
<p>As by our hands and this our present act</p>
<p>You see we do, yet see you but 645 our hands</p>
<p>And this the bleeding business they have done:</p>
<p>Our hearts you see not: they are pitiful 646 ,</p>
<p>And pity to the general wrong of Rome —</p>
<p>As fire drives out fire, so pity pity 647 —</p>
<p>Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,</p>
<p>To you our swords have leaden 648 points, Mark Antony:</p>
<p>Our arms in strength of malice 649 , and our hearts</p>
<p>Of brothers’ temper 650 , do receive 651 you in</p>
<p>With all kind 652 love, good thoughts and reverence.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Your voice 653 shall be as strong as any man’s</p>
<p>In the disposing 654 of new dignities 655 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS Only be patient till we have appeased</p>
<p>The multitude 656 , beside themselves with fear,</p>
<p>And then we will deliver you 657 the cause 658</p>
<p>Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,</p>
<p>Have thus proceeded 659 .</p>
<p>ANTONY I doubt not of your wisdom.</p>
<p>Shakes hands with each of them in turn</p>
<p>Let each man render 660 me his bloody hand.—</p>
<p>First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;—</p>
<p>Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;—</p>
<p>Now, Decius Brutus, yours;— now yours, Metellus;—</p>
<p>Yours, Cinna;— and my valiant Casca, yours;—</p>
<p>Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.—</p>
<p>Gentlemen all: alas, what shall I say?</p>
<p>My credit 661 now stands on such slipp’ry 662 ground</p>
<p>That one of two bad ways you must conceit 663 me,</p>
<p>Either a coward or a flatterer.—</p>
<p>That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true:</p>
<p>If then thy spirit look upon us now,</p>
<p>Shall it not grieve thee dearer 664 than thy death</p>
<p>To see thy Antony making his peace,</p>
<p>Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes?</p>
<p>Most noble 665 in the presence of thy corpse,</p>
<p>Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,</p>
<p>Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,</p>
<p>It would become 666 me better than to close 667</p>
<p>In terms of friendship with thine enemies.</p>
<p>Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed 668 , brave hart 669 ,</p>
<p>Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand</p>
<p>Signed in 670 thy spoil 671 and crimsoned in thy Lethe 672 .—</p>
<p>O world, thou wast the forest to this 673 hart,</p>
<p>And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee.—</p>
<p>How like a deer, strucken by many princes,</p>
<p>Dost thou here lie?</p>
<p>CASSIUS Mark Antony—</p>
<p>ANTONY Pardon me, Caius Cassius.</p>
<p>The enemies 674 of Caesar shall say this:</p>
<p>Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty 675 .</p>
<p>CASSIUS I blame you not for praising Caesar so,</p>
<p>But what compact 676 mean you to have with us?</p>
<p>Will you be pricked 677 in number of our friends,</p>
<p>Or shall we on 678 , and not depend on you?</p>
<p>ANTONY Therefore 679 I took your hands, but was indeed</p>
<p>Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar.</p>
<p>Friends am I with you all, and love you all,</p>
<p>Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons</p>
<p>Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Or else 680 were this a savage spectacle:</p>
<p>Our reasons are so full of good regard 681</p>
<p>That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,</p>
<p>You should be satisfied.</p>
<p>ANTONY That’s all I seek,</p>
<p>And am moreover suitor, that I may</p>
<p>Produce 682 his body to the market-place,</p>
<p>And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,</p>
<p>Speak in the order 683 of his funeral.</p>
<p>BRUTUS You shall, Mark Antony.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Brutus, a word with you.</p>
<p>Aside to Brutus</p>
<p>You know not what you do. Do not consent</p>
<p>That Antony speak in his funeral:</p>
<p>Know you how much the people may be moved</p>
<p>By that which he will utter.</p>
<p>BRUTUS By your pardon:</p>
<p>Aside to Cassius</p>
<p>I will myself into the pulpit first,</p>
<p>And show the reason of our Caesar’s death.</p>
<p>What Antony shall speak, I will protest 684</p>
<p>He speaks by leave 685 and by permission,</p>
<p>And that we are contented Caesar shall</p>
<p>Have all true rites 686 and lawful ceremonies.</p>
<p>It shall advantage more than do us wrong.</p>
<p>CASSIUS I know not what may fall 687 . I like it not.</p>
<p>Aside to Brutus</p>
<p>BRUTUS Mark Antony, here take you Caesar’s body.</p>
<p>You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,</p>
<p>But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,</p>
<p>And say you do’t by our permission:</p>
<p>Else shall you not have any hand at all</p>
<p>About 688 his funeral. And you shall speak</p>
<p>In the same pulpit whereto I am going,</p>
<p>After my speech is ended.</p>
<p>ANTONY Be it so:</p>
<p>I do desire no more.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Prepare the body then, and follow us.</p>
<p>Exeunt. Antony remains</p>
<p>ANTONY O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,</p>
<p>To Caesar’s body</p>
<p>That I am meek and gentle with these butchers.</p>
<p>Thou art the ruins of the noblest man</p>
<p>That ever livèd in the tide of times 689 .</p>
<p>Woe to the hand that shed this costly 690 blood.</p>
<p>Over thy wounds now do I prophesy —</p>
<p>Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips</p>
<p>To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue —</p>
<p>A curse shall light upon the limbs of men:</p>
<p>Domestic fury and fierce civil strife</p>
<p>Shall cumber 691 all the parts of Italy:</p>
<p>Blood and destruction shall be so in use 692 ,</p>
<p>And dreadful objects 693 so familiar,</p>
<p>That mothers shall but smile when they behold</p>
<p>Their infants quartered 694 with the hands of war:</p>
<p>All pity choked with custom of 695 fell 696 deeds,</p>
<p>And Caesar’s spirit ranging 697 for revenge,</p>
<p>With Ate 698 by his side, come hot from hell,</p>
<p>Shall in these confines 699 , with a monarch’s voice</p>
<p>Cry havoc 700 and let slip 701 the dogs of war,</p>
<p>That 702 this foul 703 deed shall smell above the earth</p>
<p>With 704 carrion men 705 , groaning 706 for burial.—</p>
<p>Enter Octavius’ Servant</p>
<p>You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?</p>
<p>SERVANT I do, Mark Antony.</p>
<p>ANTONY Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.</p>
<p>SERVANT He did receive his letters and is coming,</p>
<p>And bid me say to you by word of mouth—</p>
<p>O Caesar!</p>
<p>Sees the body</p>
<p>ANTONY Thy heart is big 707 : get thee apart and weep.</p>
<p>Passion 708 , I see, is catching, for mine eyes,</p>
<p>Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,</p>
<p>Began to water. Is thy master coming?</p>
<p>SERVANT He lies tonight within seven leagues 709 of Rome.</p>
<p>ANTONY Post 710 back with speed and tell him what hath chanced:</p>
<p>Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,</p>
<p>No Rome of safety for Octavius yet.</p>
<p>Hie hence 711 , and tell him so. Yet stay awhile.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse</p>
<p>Into the market-place: there shall I try 712</p>
<p>In my oration how the people take</p>
<p>The cruel issue 713 of these bloody men,</p>
<p>According to the which 714 thou shalt discourse 715</p>
<p>To young Octavius of the state of things.</p>
<p>Lend me your hand.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>With the body</p>
