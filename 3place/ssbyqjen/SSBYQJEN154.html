<h4 id="scene-1-210-running-scene-3">Scene 1 210 ／running scene 3</h4>
<p>Enter a Fairy at one door and Robin Goodfellow 211 [Puck 212 ] at
another</p>
<p>ROBIN How now, spirit, whither wander you?</p>
<p>FAIRY Over hill, over dale,</p>
<p>Through bush, through brier,</p>
<p>Over park 213 , over pale 214 ,</p>
<p>Thorough 215 flood, thorough fire,</p>
<p>I do wander everywhere,</p>
<p>Swifter than the moon’s sphere 216 ;</p>
<p>And I serve the fairy queen,</p>
<p>To dew her orbs 217 upon the green.</p>
<p>The cowslips tall her pensioners 218 be,</p>
<p>In their gold coats spots you see,</p>
<p>Those be rubies, fairy favours 219 ,</p>
<p>In those freckles live their savours 220 .</p>
<p>I must go seek some dewdrops here,</p>
<p>And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.</p>
<p>Farewell, thou lob 221 of spirits, I’ll be gone:</p>
<p>Our queen and all her elves come here anon 222 .</p>
<p>ROBIN The king doth keep his revels here tonight:</p>
<p>Take heed the queen come not within his sight,</p>
<p>For Oberon is passing fell 223 and wrath 224 ,</p>
<p>Because that she as her attendant hath</p>
<p>A lovely boy, stol’n from an Indian king.</p>
<p>She never had so sweet a changeling 225 ,</p>
<p>And jealous Oberon would have the child</p>
<p>Knight of his train, to trace 226 the forests wild.</p>
<p>But she perforce 227 withholds the lovèd boy,</p>
<p>Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy.</p>
<p>And now they never meet in grove or green,</p>
<p>By fountain 228 clear or spangled starlight sheen 229 ,</p>
<p>But they do square 230 , that all their elves for fear</p>
<p>Creep into acorn cups and hide them there.</p>
<p>FAIRY Either I mistake your shape and making 231 quite 232 ,</p>
<p>Or else you are that shrewd 233 and knavish sprite</p>
<p>Called Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he</p>
<p>That frights the maidens of the villagery 234 ,</p>
<p>Skim 235 milk, and sometimes labour in the quern 236 ,</p>
<p>And bootless 237 make the breathless housewife churn,</p>
<p>And sometime make the drink to bear no barm 238 ,</p>
<p>Mislead 239 night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?</p>
<p>Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,</p>
<p>You do their work and they shall have good luck.</p>
<p>Are not you he?</p>
<p>ROBIN Thou speak’st aright;</p>
<p>I am that merry wanderer of the night.</p>
<p>I jest to Oberon and make him smile</p>
<p>When I a fat and bean-fed 240 horse beguile,</p>
<p>Neighing in likeness of a filly 241 foal,</p>
<p>And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s 242 bowl 243 ,</p>
<p>In very likeness of a roasted crab 244 ,</p>
<p>And when she drinks, against her lips I bob</p>
<p>And on her withered dewlap 245 pour the ale.</p>
<p>The wisest aunt 246 , telling the saddest tale,</p>
<p>Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me,</p>
<p>Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,</p>
<p>And ‘tailor’ 247 cries, and falls into a cough.</p>
<p>And then the whole quire 248 hold their hips and laugh,</p>
<p>And waxen 249 in their mirth and neeze 250 and swear</p>
<p>A merrier hour was never wasted 251 there.</p>
<p>But, room 252 , fairy! Here comes Oberon 253 .</p>
<p>FAIRY And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!</p>
<p>Enter the King of Fairies [Oberon ] at one door with his train, and
the Queen [Titania 254 ] at another with hers</p>
<p>OBERON Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.</p>
<p>TITANIA What, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence.</p>
<p>I have forsworn his bed and company.</p>
<p>OBERON Tarry 255 , rash wanton 256 , am not I thy lord 257 ?</p>
<p>TITANIA Then I must be thy lady 258 : but I know</p>
<p>When thou hast stol’n away from fairy land,</p>
<p>And in the shape of Corin 259 sat all day,</p>
<p>Playing on pipes of corn 260 and versing 261 love</p>
<p>To amorous Phillida 262 . Why art thou here,</p>
<p>Come from the farthest step 263 of India?</p>
<p>But that, forsooth 264 , the bouncing 265 Amazon,</p>
<p>Your buskined 266 mistress and your warrior love,</p>
<p>To Theseus must be wedded; and you come</p>
<p>To give their bed joy and prosperity?</p>
<p>OBERON How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,</p>
<p>Glance at 267 my credit 268 with Hippolyta,</p>
<p>Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?</p>
<p>Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering 269 night</p>
<p>From Perigenia 270 whom he ravishèd 271 ?</p>
<p>And make him with fair Aegles 272 break his faith,</p>
<p>With Ariadne 273 and Antiopa 274 ?</p>
<p>TITANIA These are the forgeries of jealousy,</p>
<p>And never since the middle summer’s spring 275</p>
<p>Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead 276 ,</p>
<p>By pavèd 277 fountain or by rushy 278 brook,</p>
<p>Or in 279 the beachèd 280 margent 281 of the sea,</p>
<p>To dance our ringlets 282 to the whistling wind,</p>
<p>But with thy brawls 283 thou hast disturbed our sport 284 .</p>
<p>Therefore the winds, piping 285 to us in vain,</p>
<p>As in revenge, have sucked up from the sea</p>
<p>Contagious 286 fogs, which falling in the land</p>
<p>Hath every petty 287 river made so proud 288</p>
<p>That they have overborne their continents 289 .</p>
<p>The ox hath therefore stretched 290 his yoke in vain,</p>
<p>The ploughman lost 291 his sweat, and the green corn</p>
<p>Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard 292 .</p>
<p>The fold 293 stands empty in the drownèd field,</p>
<p>And crows are fatted with the murrion 294 flock,</p>
<p>The nine men’s morris 295 is filled up with mud,</p>
<p>And the quaint 296 mazes 297 in the wanton green 298</p>
<p>For lack of tread are undistinguishable.</p>
<p>The human mortals want their winter here:</p>
<p>No night is now with hymn or carol blessed 299 .</p>
<p>Therefore 300 the moon, the governess of floods 301 ,</p>
<p>Pale in her anger, washes 302 all the air,</p>
<p>That rheumatic diseases 303 do abound.</p>
<p>And through this distemperature 304 we see</p>
<p>The seasons alter; hoary-headed 305 frosts</p>
<p>Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,</p>
<p>And on old Hiems 306 ’ thin and icy crown</p>
<p>An odorous chaplet 307 of sweet summer buds</p>
<p>Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,</p>
<p>The childing 308 autumn, angry winter, change</p>
<p>Their wonted 309 liveries, and the mazèd 310 world</p>
<p>By their increase 311 now knows not which is which;</p>
<p>And this same progeny of evils comes</p>
<p>From our debate 312 , from our dissension 313 :</p>
<p>We are their parents and original 314 .</p>
<p>OBERON Do you amend it then, it lies in you.</p>
<p>Why should Titania cross her Oberon?</p>
<p>I do but beg a little changeling boy</p>
<p>To be my henchman 315 .</p>
<p>TITANIA Set your heart at rest:</p>
<p>The fairy land buys not the child of me.</p>
<p>His mother was a votress 316 of my order,</p>
<p>And in the spicèd Indian air by night</p>
<p>Full 317 often hath she gossiped by my side,</p>
<p>And sat with me on Neptune 318 ’s yellow sands,</p>
<p>Marking 319 th’embarkèd traders 320 on the flood 321 ,</p>
<p>When we have laughed to see the sails conceive</p>
<p>And grow big-bellied with the wanton 322 wind,</p>
<p>Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait 323</p>
<p>Following — her womb then rich with my young squire —</p>
<p>Would imitate, and sail upon the land,</p>
<p>To fetch me trifles, and return again</p>
<p>As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.</p>
<p>But she, being mortal, of that boy 324 did die:</p>
<p>And for her sake do I rear up her boy,</p>
<p>And for her sake I will not part with him.</p>
<p>OBERON How long within this wood intend you stay?</p>
<p>TITANIA Perchance 325 till after Theseus’ wedding day.</p>
<p>If you will patiently 326 dance in our round 327</p>
<p>And see our moonlight revels, go with us;</p>
<p>If not, shun me, and I will spare 328 your haunts.</p>
<p>OBERON Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.</p>
<p>TITANIA Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.</p>
<p>We shall chide 329 downright 330 , if I longer stay.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Titania and her train ]</p>
<p>OBERON Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from 331 this grove</p>
<p>Till I torment thee for this injury.</p>
<p>My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb’rest</p>
<p>Since 332 once I sat upon a promontory 333 ,</p>
<p>And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back</p>
<p>Uttering such dulcet 334 and harmonious breath 335</p>
<p>That the rude 336 sea grew civil at her song,</p>
<p>And certain 337 stars shot madly from their spheres</p>
<p>To hear the sea-maid’s music.</p>
<p>ROBIN I remember.</p>
<p>OBERON That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,</p>
<p>Flying between the cold moon and the earth,</p>
<p>Cupid all 338 armed; a certain 339 aim he took</p>
<p>At a fair vestal 340 thronèd by the west,</p>
<p>And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,</p>
<p>As 341 it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.</p>
<p>But I might 342 see young Cupid’s fiery shaft</p>
<p>Quenched in the chaste beams of the wat’ry moon;</p>
<p>And the imperial votress passèd on,</p>
<p>In maiden meditation, fancy-free 343 .</p>
<p>Yet marked I where the bolt 344 of Cupid fell.</p>
<p>It fell upon a little western flower,</p>
<p>Before milk-white, now purple 345 with love’s wound,</p>
<p>And maidens call it love-in-idleness 346 .</p>
<p>Fetch me that flower; the herb I showed thee once:</p>
<p>The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid</p>
<p>Will make or 347 man or woman madly dote</p>
<p>Upon the next live creature that it sees.</p>
<p>Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again</p>
<p>Ere the leviathan 348 can swim a league.</p>
<p>ROBIN I’ll put a girdle 349 round about the earth</p>
<p>In forty minutes.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>OBERON Having once this juice,</p>
<p>I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep,</p>
<p>And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.</p>
<p>The next thing when she waking looks upon,</p>
<p>Be it on lion, bear, or wolf or bull,</p>
<p>On meddling monkey or on busy ape,</p>
<p>She shall pursue it with the soul of love.</p>
<p>And ere I take this charm off from her sight,</p>
<p>As I can take it with another herb,</p>
<p>I’ll make her render up her page to me.</p>
<p>But who comes here? I am invisible,</p>
<p>And I will overhear their conference.</p>
<p>He stands aside</p>
<p>Enter Demetrius, Helena following him</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.</p>
<p>Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?</p>
<p>The one I’ll stay, the other stayeth 350 me.</p>
<p>Thou told’st me they were stolen into this wood 351 ;</p>
<p>And here am I, and wood within this wood,</p>
<p>Because I cannot meet my Hermia.</p>
<p>Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.</p>
<p>HELENA You draw 352 me, you hard-hearted adamant 353 ;</p>
<p>But yet you draw not iron, for my heart</p>
<p>Is true as steel. Leave you 354 your power to draw,</p>
<p>And I shall have no power to follow you.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair 355 ?</p>
<p>Or rather do I not in plainest truth</p>
<p>Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you?</p>
<p>HELENA And even for that do I love thee the more.</p>
<p>I am your spaniel, and, Demetrius,</p>
<p>The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.</p>
<p>Use me but 356 as your spaniel: spurn me, strike me,</p>
<p>Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave 357 ,</p>
<p>Unworthy as I am, to follow you.</p>
<p>What worser place can I beg in your love —</p>
<p>And yet a place of high respect with me —</p>
<p>Than to be used as you do use your dog?</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,</p>
<p>For I am sick when I do look on thee.</p>
<p>HELENA And I am sick when I look not on you.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS You do impeach 358 your modesty too much,</p>
<p>To leave the city and commit yourself</p>
<p>Into the hands of one that loves you not,</p>
<p>To trust the opportunity of night</p>
<p>And the ill counsel of a desert 359 place</p>
<p>With the rich worth of your virginity.</p>
<p>HELENA Your virtue is my privilege 360 : for that 361</p>
<p>It is not night when I do see your face,</p>
<p>Therefore I think I am not in the night.</p>
<p>Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,</p>
<p>For you in my respect are all the world.</p>
<p>Then how can it be said I am alone,</p>
<p>When all the world is here to look on me?</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes 362 ,</p>
<p>And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.</p>
<p>HELENA The wildest hath not such a heart as you.</p>
<p>Run when you will, the story shall be changed:</p>
<p>Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase 363 ;</p>
<p>The dove pursues the griffin 364 , the mild hind 365</p>
<p>Makes speed to catch the tiger. Bootless 366 speed,</p>
<p>When cowardice pursues and valour flies.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS I will not stay 367 thy questions, let me go;</p>
<p>Or if thou follow me, do not believe</p>
<p>But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.</p>
<p>[↓Exit Demetrius ↓]</p>
<p>HELENA Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,</p>
<p>You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!</p>
<p>Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex 368 :</p>
<p>We cannot fight for love, as men may do;</p>
<p>We should be wooed and were not made to woo.</p>
<p>I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,</p>
<p>To die upon 369 the hand I love so well.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>OBERON Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,</p>
<p>Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.</p>
<p>Enter [Robin ] Puck</p>
<p>Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.</p>
<p>ROBIN Ay, there it is.</p>
<p>Shows the flower</p>
<p>OBERON I pray thee give it me.</p>
<p>I know a bank where the wild thyme blows 370 ,</p>
<p>Where oxlips 371 and the nodding violet grows,</p>
<p>Quite 372 over-canopied with luscious woodbine 373 ,</p>
<p>With sweet musk-roses 374 and with eglantine 375 :</p>
<p>There sleeps Titania sometime 376 of the night,</p>
<p>Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight:</p>
<p>And there the snake throws 377 her enamelled skin,</p>
<p>Weed 378 wide enough to wrap a fairy in.</p>
<p>And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes,</p>
<p>And make her full of hateful fantasies.</p>
<p>Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove;</p>
<p>Gives him some juice</p>
<p>A sweet Athenian lady is in love</p>
<p>With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes,</p>
<p>But do it when the next thing he espies</p>
<p>May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man</p>
<p>By the Athenian garments he hath on.</p>
<p>Effect it with some care, that he may prove</p>
<p>More fond on 379 her than she upon her love;</p>
