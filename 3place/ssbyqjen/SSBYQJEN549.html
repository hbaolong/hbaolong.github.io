<h4 id="scene-1-1-running-scene-1">Scene 1 1 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter Rodorigo and Iago</p>
<p>RODORIGO Never tell me! 2 I take it much unkindly 3</p>
<p>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</p>
<p>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this 4 .</p>
<p>IAGO But you’ll not hear me: if ever I did dream</p>
<p>Of such a matter, abhor me.</p>
<p>RODORIGO Thou told’st me</p>
<p>Thou didst hold him 5 in thy hate.</p>
<p>IAGO Despise me</p>
<p>If I do not. Three great ones 6 of the city,</p>
<p>In personal suit 7 to make me his lieutenant,</p>
<p>Off-capped 8 to him, and by the faith of man,</p>
<p>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:</p>
<p>But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,</p>
<p>Evades them with a bombast circumstance 9</p>
<p>Horribly stuffed with epithets of war, 10</p>
<p>Nonsuits my mediators 11 . For ‘Certes’ 12 , says he,</p>
<p>‘I have already chose my officer.’</p>
<p>And what was he?</p>
<p>Forsooth 13 , a great arithmetician 14 ,</p>
<p>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine 15 —</p>
<p>A fellow almost damned in a fair wife 16 —</p>
<p>That never set a squadron 17 in the field</p>
<p>Nor the division of a battle 18 knows</p>
<p>More than a spinster 19 , unless 20 the bookish theoric 21 ,</p>
<p>Wherein the toga 22 ’d consuls 23 can propose 24</p>
<p>As masterly as he. Mere prattle 25 without practice</p>
<p>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th’election 26 ;</p>
<p>And I — of whom his 27 eyes had seen the proof</p>
<p>At Rhodes 28 , at Cyprus 29 and on others’ grounds,</p>
<p>Christened 30 and heathen — must be beleed 31 and calmed</p>
<p>By debitor and creditor 32 : this counter-caster 33 ,</p>
<p>He — in good time 34 — must his lieutenant be,</p>
<p>And I — bless the mark 35 ! — his Moorship 36 ’s ancient 37 .</p>
<p>RODORIGO By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</p>
<p>IAGO Why, there’s no remedy: ’tis the curse of service 38 ;</p>
<p>Preferment 39 goes by letter and affection 40 ,</p>
<p>And not by old gradation 41 , where each second</p>
<p>Stood heir to th’first. Now, sir, be judge yourself</p>
<p>Whether I in any just term 42 am affined 43</p>
<p>To love the Moor.</p>
<p>RODORIGO I would not follow 44 him then.</p>
<p>IAGO O, sir, content you:</p>
<p>I follow him to serve my turn 45 upon him.</p>
<p>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</p>
<p>Cannot be truly 46 followed. You shall mark 47</p>
<p>Many a duteous and knee-crooking 48 knave</p>
<p>That — doting on his own obsequious bondage —</p>
<p>Wears out his time 49 , much like his master’s ass,</p>
<p>For nought but provender 50 , and when he’s old, cashiered:</p>
<p>Whip me 51 such honest knaves. Others there are</p>
<p>Who, trimmed 52 in forms and visages of duty,</p>
<p>Keep yet their hearts attending on 53 themselves,</p>
<p>And throwing but shows of service on their lords,</p>
<p>Do well thrive by them,</p>
<p>And when they have lined their coats 54</p>
<p>Do themselves homage 55 : these fellows have some soul,</p>
<p>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</p>
<p>It is as sure as you are Rodorigo,</p>
<p>Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago 56 :</p>
<p>In following him, I follow but myself.</p>
<p>Heaven is my judge, not I for 57 love and duty,</p>
<p>But seeming so, for my peculiar 58 end,</p>
<p>For when my outward action doth demonstrate 59</p>
<p>The native 60 act and figure 61 of my heart</p>
<p>In compliment extern 62 , ’tis not long after</p>
<p>But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</p>
<p>For daws 63 to peck at: I am not what I am.</p>
<p>RODORIGO What a full 64 fortune does the thick-lips owe 65</p>
<p>If he can carry’t 66 thus!</p>
<p>IAGO Call up her father:</p>
<p>Rouse him, make after 67 him, poison his delight,</p>
<p>Proclaim 68 him in the streets, incense her kinsmen,</p>
<p>And though 69 he in a fertile climate dwell,</p>
<p>Plague him with flies: though that 70 his joy be joy,</p>
<p>Yet throw such chances 71 of vexation on’t</p>
<p>As it may 72 lose some colour.</p>
<p>RODORIGO Here is her father’s house, I’ll call aloud.</p>
<p>IAGO Do, with like timorous accent 73 and dire yell</p>
<p>As when, by night and negligence, the fire</p>
<p>Is spied in populous cities.</p>
<p>RODORIGO What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!</p>
<p>IAGO Awake! What, ho! Brabantio, thieves, thieves!</p>
<p>Look to your house, your daughter and your bags 74 !</p>
<p>Thieves, thieves!</p>
<p>BRABANTIO What is the reason of this terrible summons?</p>
<p>Above 75</p>
<p>At a window</p>
<p>What is the matter there?</p>
<p>RODORIGO Signior, is all your family within?</p>
<p>IAGO Are your doors locked?</p>
<p>BRABANTIO Why? Wherefore 76 ask you this?</p>
<p>IAGO Sir, you’re robbed. For shame, put on your gown 77 !</p>
<p>Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul:</p>
<p>Even now, now, very now, an old black ram 78</p>
<p>Is tupping 79 your white ewe. Arise, arise!</p>
<p>Awake the snorting 80 citizens with the bell 81 ,</p>
<p>Or else the devil 82 will make a grandsire 83 of you.</p>
<p>Arise, I say!</p>
<p>BRABANTIO What, have you lost your wits?</p>
<p>RODORIGO Most reverend 84 signior, do you know my voice?</p>
<p>BRABANTIO Not I: what are you?</p>
<p>RODORIGO My name is Rodorigo.</p>
<p>BRABANTIO The worser welcome.</p>
<p>I have charged 85 thee not to haunt 86 about my doors:</p>
<p>In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</p>
<p>My daughter is not for thee: and now in madness —</p>
<p>Being full of supper and distemp ’ring draughts 87 —</p>
<p>Upon malicious knavery dost thou come</p>
<p>To star 88 t my quiet.</p>
<p>RODORIGO Sir, sir, sir—</p>
<p>BRABANTIO But thou must needs be sure</p>
<p>My spirits and my place 89 have in their power</p>
<p>To make this bitter to thee.</p>
<p>RODORIGO Patience, good sir.</p>
<p>BRABANTIO What tell’st thou me of robbing?</p>
<p>This is Venice: my house is not a grange 90 .</p>
<p>RODORIGO Most grave 91 Brabantio,</p>
<p>In simple 92 and pure soul I come to you.</p>
<p>IAGO Sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil
bid you. Because we come to do you service and you think we are
ruffians, you’ll have your daughter covered 93 with a Barbary 94 horse
95 : you’ll have your nephews 96 neigh to you: you’ll have coursers 97
for cousins and jennets 98 for germans 99 .</p>
<p>BRABANTIO What profane 100 wretch art thou?</p>
<p>IAGO I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor
are making the beast with two backs 101 .</p>
<p>BRABANTIO Thou art a villain.</p>
<p>IAGO You are a senator.</p>
<p>BRABANTIO This thou shalt answer 102 . I know thee, Rodorigo.</p>
<p>RODORIGO Sir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you</p>
<p>If’t be your pleasure 103 and most wise consent —</p>
<p>As partly I find it is — that your fair daughter,</p>
<p>At this odd-even 104 and dull watch o’th’night,</p>
<p>Transported with 105 no worse nor better guard</p>
<p>But with 106 a knave 107 of common hire, a gondolier,</p>
<p>To the gross 108 clasps of a lascivious Moor:</p>
<p>If this be known to you and your allowance 109</p>
<p>We then have done you bold and saucy 110 wrongs:</p>
<p>But if you know not this, my manners tell me</p>
<p>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</p>
<p>That, from 111 the sense of all civility 112 ,</p>
<p>I thus would play and trifle with your reverence 113 .</p>
<p>Your daughter — if you have not given her leave 114 —</p>
<p>I say again, hath made a gross 115 revolt,</p>
<p>Tying her duty, beauty, wit 116 and fortunes</p>
<p>In 117 an extravagant and wheeling 118 stranger 119</p>
<p>Of here and everywhere. Straight 120 satisfy yourself:</p>
<p>If she be in her chamber or your house,</p>
<p>Let loose on me the justice of the state</p>
<p>For thus deluding you.</p>
<p>BRABANTIO Strike on the tinder 121 , ho!</p>
<p>Give me a taper 122 ! Call up all my people!</p>
<p>This accident 123 is not unlike my dream:</p>
<p>Belief of it oppresses me already.</p>
<p>Light, I say, light!</p>
<p>Exit [above ]</p>
<p>IAGO Farewell, for I must leave you:</p>
<p>It seems not meet 124 nor wholesome 125 to my place 126</p>
<p>To be producted 127 — as, if I stay, I shall —</p>
<p>Against the Moor, for I do know the state,</p>
<p>However this may gall 128 him with some check 129 ,</p>
<p>Cannot with safety cast 130 him, for he’s embarked 131</p>
<p>With such loud reason 132 to the Cyprus wars,</p>
<p>Which even now stands in act 133 , that, for 134 their souls,</p>
<p>Another of his fathom 135 they have none,</p>
<p>To lead their business: in which regard,</p>
<p>Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.</p>
<p>Yet for necessity of present life 136</p>
<p>I must show out a flag and sign 137 of love,</p>
<p>Which is indeed but sign. That 138 you shall surely find him,</p>
<p>Lead to the Sagittary 139 the raisèd search 140 ,</p>
<p>And there will I be with him. So farewell.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Brabantio with Servants and torches</p>
<p>BRABANTIO It is too true an evil: gone she is,</p>
<p>And what’s to come of my despisèd time 141</p>
<p>Is nought but bitterness. Now, Rodorigo,</p>
<p>Where didst thou see her?— O, unhappy 142 girl!—</p>
<p>With the Moor, say’st thou?— Who would be a father?—</p>
<p>How didst thou know’twas she?— O, she deceives me</p>
<p>Past thought 143 !— What said she to you?— Get more tapers:</p>
<p>Raise all my kindred.— Are they married, think you?</p>
<p>RODORIGO Truly, I think they are.</p>
<p>BRABANTIO O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood 144 !</p>
<p>Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters’ minds</p>
<p>By what you see them act. Is there not charms 145</p>
<p>By which the property 146 of youth and maidhood 147</p>
<p>May be abused? Have you not read, Rodorigo,</p>
<p>Of some such thing?</p>
<p>RODORIGO Yes, sir, I have indeed.</p>
<p>BRABANTIO Call up my brother.— O, would you had had her!—</p>
<p>Some one way, some another.— Do you know</p>
<p>To Rodorigo</p>
<p>Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?</p>
<p>RODORIGO I think I can discover 148 him, if you please</p>
<p>To get good guard and go along with me.</p>
<p>BRABANTIO Pray you lead on. At every house I’ll call:</p>
<p>I may command 149 at most.— Get weapons, ho!</p>
<p>And raise some special officers of might.—</p>
<p>On, good Rodorigo: I will deserve your pains 150 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
