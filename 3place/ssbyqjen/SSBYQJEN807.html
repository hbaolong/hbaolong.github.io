<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-10">Scene 2 / running scene 10</h4>
<p>Enter two or three [Murderers ] running over the stage, from the
murder of Duke Humphrey Gloucester ]</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Run to my lord of Suffolk: let him know</p>
<p>We have dispatched 829 the duke, as he commanded.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER O, that it were to do 830 ! What have we done?</p>
<p>Didst ever hear a man so penitent?</p>
<p>Enter Suffolk</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Here comes my lord.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Now, sirs, have you dispatched this thing?</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Ay, my good lord, he’s dead.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Why, that’s well said. Go, get you to my house:</p>
<p>I will reward you for this venturous 831 deed:</p>
<p>The king and all the peers are here at hand.</p>
<p>Have you laid fair 832 the bed? Is all things well,</p>
<p>According as I gave directions?</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER ’Tis, my good lord.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Away! Be gone</p>
<p>Exeunt [Murderers ]</p>
<p>Sound trumpets. Enter the King [Henry VI ], the Queen [Margaret ],
Cardinal, Somerset, with Attendants</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Go call our uncle to our presence straight 833 :</p>
<p>Say we intend to try his grace today</p>
<p>If 834 he be guilty, as ’tis publishèd 835 .</p>
<p>SUFFOLK I’ll call him presently, my noble lord.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Lords, take your places: and, I pray you all,</p>
<p>Proceed no straiter 836 gainst our uncle Gloucester</p>
<p>Than from true evidence of good esteem 837</p>
<p>He be approved in 838 practice culpable 839 .</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET God forbid any malice should prevail,</p>
<p>That faultless may condemn a noble man 840 :</p>
<p>Pray God he may acquit him 841 of suspicion!</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI I thank thee, Meg: these words content me much.</p>
<p>Enter Suffolk</p>
<p>How now? Why look’st thou pale? Why tremblest thou?</p>
<p>Where is our uncle? What’s the matter, Suffolk?</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Dead in his bed, my lord: Gloucester is dead.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Marry, God forfend 842 !</p>
<p>CARDINAL God’s secret judgement: I did dream tonight 843</p>
<p>The duke was dumb and could not speak a word.</p>
<p>King [Henry VI ] swoons</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET How fares my lord?— Help, lords, the king is dead!</p>
<p>SOMERSET Rear up 844 his body: wring 845 him by the nose.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!</p>
<p>SUFFOLK He doth revive again: madam, be patient.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI O heavenly God!</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET How fares my gracious lord?</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Comfort, my sovereign: gracious Henry, comfort.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI What, doth my lord of Suffolk comfort me?</p>
<p>Came he right now to sing a raven’s note 846 ,</p>
<p>Whose dismal 847 tune bereft 848 my vital powers:</p>
<p>And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,</p>
<p>By crying comfort from a hollow 849 breast,</p>
<p>Can chase away the first-conceivèd 850 sound?</p>
<p>Hide not thy poison with such sugared words:</p>
<p>Lay not thy hands on me: forbear I say,</p>
<p>Their touch affrights 851 me as a serpent’s sting.</p>
<p>Thou baleful 852 messenger, out of my sight:</p>
<p>Upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny</p>
<p>Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world.</p>
<p>Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:</p>
<p>Yet do not go away: come, basilisk 853 ,</p>
<p>And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight:</p>
<p>For in the shade of death I shall find joy:</p>
<p>In life, but double death, now Gloucester’s dead.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Why do you rate 854 my lord of Suffolk thus?</p>
<p>Although the duke was enemy to him,</p>
<p>Yet he most Christian-like laments his death:</p>
<p>And for myself, foe as he was to me,</p>
<p>Might liquid tears, or heart-offending 855 groans,</p>
<p>Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,</p>
<p>I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,</p>
<p>Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,</p>
<p>And all to have the noble duke alive.</p>
<p>What know I how the world may deem 856 of me?</p>
<p>For it is known we were but hollow 857 friends:</p>
<p>It may be judged I made the duke away.</p>
<p>So shall my name with slander’s tongue be wounded,</p>
<p>And princes’ courts be filled with my reproach 858 :</p>
<p>This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy,</p>
<p>To be a queen, and crowned with infamy.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Be woe 859 for me, more wretched than he is.</p>
<p>What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?</p>
<p>I am no loathsome leper: look on me.</p>
<p>What, art thou, like the adder, waxen 860 deaf 861 ?</p>
<p>Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn 862 queen.</p>
<p>Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester’s tomb?</p>
<p>Why, then, Dame Margaret was ne’er thy joy.</p>
<p>Erect his statue and worship it,</p>
<p>And make my image but an ale-house sign.</p>
<p>Was I for this nigh 863 wracked upon the sea</p>
<p>And twice by awkward 864 wind from England’s bank 865</p>
<p>Drove back again unto my native clime 866 ?</p>
<p>What boded this, but 867 well forewarning wind</p>
<p>Did seem to say ’Seek not a scorpion’s nest,</p>
<p>Nor set no footing on this unkind 868 shore’?</p>
<p>What did I then, but cursed the gentle 869 gusts</p>
<p>And he 870 that loosed them forth 871 their brazen 872 caves,</p>
<p>And bid them blow towards England’s blessèd shore,</p>
<p>Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?</p>
<p>Yet Aeolus 873 would not be a murderer,</p>
<p>But left that hateful office unto thee.</p>
<p>The pretty 874 vaulting 875 sea refused to drown me,</p>
<p>Knowing that thou wouldst have me drowned on shore</p>
<p>With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness.</p>
<p>The splitting 876 rocks cowered in the sinking sands 877 ,</p>
<p>And would not dash me with their ragged sides,</p>
<p>Because 878 thy flinty heart, more hard than they,</p>
<p>Might in thy palace perish 879 Margaret.</p>
<p>As far as I could ken 880 thy chalky cliffs,</p>
<p>When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,</p>
<p>I stood upon the hatches 881 in the storm,</p>
<p>And when the dusky sky began to rob</p>
<p>My earnest-gaping 882 sight of thy land’s view,</p>
<p>I took a costly jewel from my neck —</p>
<p>A heart it was, bound in with 883 diamonds —</p>
<p>And threw it towards thy land. The sea received it,</p>
<p>And so I wished thy body might my heart:</p>
<p>And even with this, I lost fair England’s view,</p>
<p>And bid mine eyes be packing 884 with my heart 885 ,</p>
<p>And called them blind and dusky spectacles,</p>
<p>For losing ken of Albion’s wishèd 886 coast.</p>
<p>How often have I tempted Suffolk’s tongue,</p>
<p>The agent 887 of thy foul inconstancy,</p>
<p>To sit and witch 888 me as Ascanius 889 did,</p>
<p>When he to madding 890 Dido would unfold</p>
<p>His father’s acts commenced in burning Troy.</p>
<p>Am I not witched like her? Or thou not false 891 like him?</p>
<p>Ay me, I can no more 892 : die, Margaret,</p>
<p>For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.</p>
<p>Noise within. Enter Warwick, [Salisbury ] and many Commons 893</p>
<p>WARWICK It is reported, mighty sovereign,</p>
<p>That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murdered</p>
<p>By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort’s means:</p>
<p>The commons, like an angry hive of bees</p>
<p>That want 894 their leader, scatter up and down</p>
<p>And care not who they sting in his revenge 895 .</p>
<p>Myself have calmed their spleenful 896 mutiny,</p>
<p>Until they hear the order 897 of his death.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI That he is dead, good Warwick, ’tis too true:</p>
<p>But how he died, God knows, not Henry:</p>
<p>Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,</p>
<p>And comment then upon 898 his sudden death.</p>
<p>WARWICK That shall I do, my liege.— Stay, Salisbury,</p>
<p>With the rude 899 multitude till I return.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Warwick, Salisbury and Commons ]</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI O, thou that judgest all things, stay 900 my
thoughts:</p>
<p>My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul</p>
<p>Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey’s life:</p>
<p>If my suspect 901 be false, forgive me, God,</p>
<p>For judgement only doth belong to thee:</p>
<p>Fain 902 would I go to chafe 903 his paly 904 lips</p>
<p>With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain</p>
<p>Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,</p>
<p>To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk 905 ,</p>
<p>And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:</p>
<p>But all in vain are these mean obsequies 906</p>
<p>Bed put forth</p>
<p>And to survey his dead and earthy image:</p>
<p>What were it but to make my sorrow greater?</p>
<p>[Enter Warwick to reveal Gloucester’s body in his bed 907 ]</p>
<p>WARWICK Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI That is to see how deep my grave is made,</p>
<p>For with his soul fled all my worldly solace:</p>
<p>For seeing him, I see my life in death 908 .</p>
<p>WARWICK As surely as my soul intends to live</p>
<p>With that dread 909 king 910 that took our state upon him</p>
<p>To free us from his father’s wrathful curse,</p>
<p>I do believe that violent hands were laid</p>
<p>Upon the life of this thrice-famèd 911 duke.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue:</p>
<p>What instance 912 gives Lord Warwick for his vow?</p>
<p>WARWICK See how the blood is settled 913 in his face.</p>
<p>Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost 914 ,</p>
<p>Of ashy semblance, meagre 915 , pale and bloodless,</p>
<p>Being 916 all descended to the labouring heart,</p>
<p>Who in the conflict that it holds with death,</p>
<p>Attracts the same for aidance 917 gainst the enemy,</p>
<p>Which 918 with the heart there cools, and ne’er returneth</p>
<p>To blush and beautify the cheek again.</p>
<p>But see, his face is black and full of blood:</p>
<p>His eyeballs further out than when he lived,</p>
<p>Staring full ghastly like a strangled man:</p>
<p>His hair upreared 919 , his nostrils stretched with struggling:</p>
<p>His hands abroad displayed 920 , as one that grasped</p>
<p>And tugged for life and was by strength subdued.</p>
<p>Look, on the sheets his hair, you see, is sticking.</p>
<p>His well-proportioned 921 beard, made rough and rugged 922 ,</p>
<p>Like to the summer’s corn by tempest lodged 923 :</p>
<p>It cannot be but he was murdered here:</p>
<p>The least of all these signs were probable 924 .</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?</p>
<p>Myself and Beaufort had him in protection,</p>
<p>And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.</p>
<p>WARWICK But both of you were vowed Duke Humphrey’s foes,</p>
<p>And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep 925 :</p>
<p>’Tis like 926 you would not feast 927 him like a friend,</p>
<p>And ’tis well seen 928 he found an enemy.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Then you, belike 929 , suspect these noblemen</p>
<p>As guilty of Duke Humphrey’s timeless 930 death.</p>
<p>WARWICK Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh,</p>
<p>And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,</p>
<p>But will suspect ’twas he that made the slaughter?</p>
<p>Who finds the partridge in the puttock 931 ’s nest,</p>
<p>But may imagine how the bird was dead,</p>
<p>Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?</p>
<p>Even so suspicious is this tragedy.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where’s your knife?</p>
<p>Is Beaufort termed a kite? Where are his talons?</p>
<p>SUFFOLK I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men:</p>
<p>But here’s a vengeful sword, rusted with ease 932 ,</p>
<p>That shall be scoured 933 in his rancorous heart</p>
<p>That slanders me with murder’s crimson badge 934 .</p>
<p>Say, if thou dar’st, proud Lord of Warwickshire,</p>
<p>That I am faulty 935 in Duke Humphrey’s death.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Cardinal and Somerset ]</p>
<p>WARWICK What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET He dares not calm his contumelious 936 spirit,</p>
<p>Nor cease to be an arrogant controller 937 ,</p>
<p>Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.</p>
<p>WARWICK Madam, be still: with reverence may I say,</p>
<p>For every word you speak in his behalf</p>
<p>Is slander to your royal dignity.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanour,</p>
<p>If ever lady wronged her lord so much,</p>
<p>Thy mother took into her blameful bed</p>
<p>Some stern untutored churl 938 : and noble stock 939</p>
<p>Was graft 940 with crab-tree slip 941 , whose fruit thou art,</p>
<p>And never of the Nevilles’ noble race.</p>
<p>WARWICK But that the guilt of murder bucklers 942 thee,</p>
<p>And I should rob the deathsman 943 of his fee 944 ,</p>
<p>Quitting 945 thee thereby of ten thousand shames,</p>
<p>And that my sovereign’s presence makes me mild 946 ,</p>
<p>I would, false murd’rous coward, on thy knee</p>
<p>Make thee beg pardon for thy passèd 947 speech,</p>
<p>And say it was thy mother that thou meant’st,</p>
<p>That thou thyself was born in bastardy:</p>
<p>And after all this fearful homage 948 done,</p>
<p>Give thee thy hire 949 and send thy soul to hell,</p>
<p>Pernicious 950 bloodsucker of sleeping men!</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood,</p>
<p>If from this presence 951 thou dar’st go with me.</p>
<p>WARWICK Away even now, or I will drag thee hence:</p>
<p>Unworthy though thou art, I’ll cope 952 with thee,</p>
<p>And do some service to Duke Humphrey’s ghost</p>
<p>Exeunt [Suffolk and Warwick ]</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted?</p>
<p>Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just 953 :</p>
<p>And he but naked, though locked up in steel 954 ,</p>
<p>Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted</p>
<p>A noise within</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET What noise is this?</p>
<p>Enter Suffolk and Warwick, with their weapons drawn</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Why, how now, lords? Your wrathful weapons drawn</p>
<p>Here in our presence 955 ? Dare you be so bold?</p>
<p>Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?</p>
<p>SUFFOLK The trait’rous Warwick with the men of Bury</p>
<p>Set all upon me, mighty sovereign.</p>
<p>Enter Salisbury [from the Commons, within ]</p>
<p>SALISBURY Sirs, stand apart: the king shall know your mind.—</p>
<p>To the Commons</p>
<p>Dread lord, the commons send you word by me,</p>
<p>To King Henry</p>
<p>Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,</p>
<p>Or banishèd fair England’s territories,</p>
<p>They will by violence tear him from your palace,</p>
<p>And torture him with grievous ling’ring death.</p>
<p>They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died:</p>
<p>They say, in him they fear your highness’ death:</p>
<p>And mere 956 instinct of love and loyalty,</p>
<p>Free from a stubborn opposite 957 intent,</p>
<p>As being thought to contradict your liking 958 ,</p>
<p>Makes them thus forward in 959 his banishment.</p>
<p>They say, in care of your most royal person,</p>
<p>That if your highness should intend to sleep</p>
<p>And charge 960 that no man should disturb your rest</p>
<p>In 961 pain of your dislike, or pain of death,</p>
<p>Yet, notwithstanding such a strait 962 edict,</p>
<p>Were there a serpent seen, with forkèd tongue,</p>
<p>That slyly glided towards your majesty,</p>
<p>It were but necessary you were waked:</p>
<p>Lest, being suffered 963 in that harmful slumber,</p>
<p>The mortal worm 964 might make the sleep eternal.</p>
<p>And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,</p>
<p>That they will guard you, whe’er 965 you will or no,</p>
<p>From such fell 966 serpents as false Suffolk is,</p>
<p>With whose envenomèd and fatal sting,</p>
<p>Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,</p>
<p>They say, is shamefully bereft of life.</p>
<p>COMMONS An answer from the king, my lord of Salisbury</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>SUFFOLK ’Tis like 967 the commons, rude unpolished hinds 968 ,</p>
<p>Could send such message to their sovereign:</p>
<p>But you, my lord, were glad to be employed,</p>
<p>To show how quaint 969 an orator you are.</p>
<p>But all the honour Salisbury hath won</p>
<p>Is that he was the Lord Ambassador</p>
<p>Sent from a sort 970 of tinkers 971 to the king.</p>
<p>COMMONS An answer from the king, or we will all break in</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me</p>
<p>I thank them for their tender loving care:</p>
<p>And had I not been cited 972 so by them,</p>
<p>Yet did I purpose 973 as they do entreat:</p>
<p>For sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy</p>
<p>Mischance 974 unto my state 975 by Suffolk’s means.</p>
<p>And therefore by his 976 majesty I swear,</p>
<p>Whose far unworthy deputy I am,</p>
<p>He shall not breathe infection in 977 this air</p>
<p>But 978 three days longer, on the pain of death.</p>
<p>[Exit Salisbury ]</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET O Henry, let me plead for gentle 979 Suffolk.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Ungentle 980 queen, to call him gentle Suffolk.</p>
<p>No more, I say: if thou dost plead for him,</p>
<p>Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.</p>
<p>Had I but said, I would have kept my word:</p>
<p>But when I swear, it is irrevocable:</p>
<p>If after three days’ space thou here be’st 981 found</p>
<p>On any ground that I am ruler of,</p>
<p>The world shall not be ransom for thy life.</p>
<p>Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me:</p>
<p>I have great matters to impart to thee</p>
<p>Exeunt [all but Queen Margaret and Suffolk ]</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Mischance and sorrow go along with you!</p>
<p>Heart’s discontent and sour affliction</p>
<p>Be playfellows to keep you company!</p>
<p>There’s two of you, the devil make a third,</p>
<p>And threefold vengeance tend 982 upon your steps.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Cease, gentle queen, these execrations 983 ,</p>
<p>And let thy Suffolk take his heavy 984 leave.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!</p>
<p>Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemies?</p>
<p>SUFFOLK A plague upon them! Wherefore should I curse them?</p>
<p>Could curses kill, as doth the mandrake 985 ’s groan,</p>
<p>I would invent as bitter-searching 986 terms,</p>
<p>As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,</p>
<p>Delivered strongly through my fixèd 987 teeth,</p>
<p>With full as many signs of deadly hate,</p>
<p>As lean-faced envy in her loathsome cave.</p>
<p>My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words:</p>
<p>Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint 988 :</p>
<p>Mine hair be fixed on end 989 , as one distract 990 :</p>
<p>Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban 991 ,</p>
<p>And even now my burdened heart would break</p>
<p>Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!</p>
<p>Gall 992 , worse than gall, the daintiest 993 that they taste:</p>
<p>Their sweetest shade, a grove of cypress trees 994 :</p>
<p>Their chiefest prospect 995 , murd’ring basilisks 996 :</p>
<p>Their softest touch, as smart 997 as lizards 998 ’ stings:</p>
<p>Their music, frightful as the serpent’s hiss,</p>
<p>And boding 999 screech-owls make the consort 1000 full!</p>
<p>All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell—</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Enough, sweet Suffolk, thou torment’st thyself,</p>
<p>And these dread curses, like the sun gainst glass,</p>
<p>Or like an overchargèd 1001 gun, recoil,</p>
<p>And turn the force of them upon thyself.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave 1002 ?</p>
<p>Now by the ground that I am banished from,</p>
<p>Well could I curse away a winter’s night,</p>
<p>Though standing naked on a mountain top,</p>
<p>Where biting cold would never let grass grow,</p>
<p>And think it but a minute spent in sport 1003 .</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET O, let me entreat thee cease: give me thy hand,</p>
<p>That I may dew it with my mournful tears:</p>
<p>Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,</p>
<p>To wash away my woeful monuments 1004 .</p>
<p>She kisses his hand</p>
<p>O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,</p>
<p>That thou mightst think upon these by the seal 1005 ,</p>
<p>Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee.</p>
<p>So get thee gone, that I may know 1006 my grief:</p>
<p>’Tis but surmised 1007 whiles thou art standing by,</p>
<p>As one that surfeits 1008 thinking on a want 1009 :</p>
<p>I will repeal 1010 thee, or, be well assured,</p>
<p>Adventure 1011 to be banishèd myself:</p>
<p>And banishèd I am, if but from thee.</p>
<p>Go, speak not to me: even now be gone.</p>
<p>O, go not yet. Even thus two friends 1012 condemned</p>
<p>Embrace, and kiss, and take ten thousand leaves,</p>
<p>Loather 1013 a hundred times to part than die:</p>
<p>Yet now farewell, and farewell life with thee.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banishèd:</p>
<p>Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee.</p>
<p>’Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence 1014 :</p>
<p>A wilderness is populous enough,</p>
<p>So 1015 Suffolk had thy heavenly company:</p>
<p>For where thou art, there is the world itself,</p>
<p>With every several 1016 pleasure in the world:</p>
<p>And where thou art not, desolation.</p>
<p>I can no more: live thou to joy 1017 thy life:</p>
<p>Myself no joy in naught but that thou liv’st.</p>
<p>Enter Vaux</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Whither goes Vaux so fast? What news, I prithee?</p>
<p>VAUX To signify unto his majesty</p>
<p>That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death:</p>
<p>For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,</p>
<p>That makes him gasp, and stare, and catch the 1018 air,</p>
<p>Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.</p>
<p>Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey’s ghost</p>
<p>Were by his side: sometime he calls the king,</p>
<p>And whispers to his pillow, as 1019 to him,</p>
<p>The secrets of his overchargèd 1020 soul;</p>
<p>And I am sent to tell his majesty</p>
<p>That even now he cries aloud for him.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Go tell this heavy 1021 message to the king.</p>
<p>Exit [Vaux ]</p>
<p>Ay me! What is this world? What news are these?</p>
<p>But wherefore grieve I at an hour’s poor loss 1022 ,</p>
<p>Omitting 1023 Suffolk’s exile, my soul’s treasure?</p>
<p>Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,</p>
<p>And with the southern clouds 1024 contend in 1025 tears?</p>
<p>Theirs for the earth’s increase, mine for my sorrows.</p>
<p>Now get thee hence: the king, thou know’st, is coming:</p>
<p>If thou be found by 1026 me, thou art but 1027 dead.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK If I depart from thee, I cannot live:</p>
<p>And in thy sight to die 1028 , what were it else</p>
<p>But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap 1029 ?</p>
<p>Here could I breathe my soul into the air 1030 ,</p>
<p>As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe</p>
<p>Dying with mother’s dug 1031 between its lips.</p>
<p>Where 1032 , from 1033 thy sight, I should be raging mad,</p>
<p>And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,</p>
<p>To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth,</p>
<p>So shouldst thou either turn 1034 my flying soul,</p>
<p>He kisses her</p>
<p>Or I should breathe it so into thy body,</p>
<p>And then it lived 1035 in sweet Elysium 1036 .</p>
<p>To die by thee were but to die in jest 1037 :</p>
<p>From thee to die were torture more than death:</p>
<p>O let me stay, befall what may befall!</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Away: though parting be a fretful 1038 corrosive,</p>
<p>It is applièd to a deathful 1039 wound.</p>
<p>To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee:</p>
<p>For wheresoe’er thou art in this world’s globe,</p>
<p>I’ll have an Iris 1040 that shall find thee out.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK I go.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET And take my heart with thee.</p>
<p>She kisses him</p>
<p>SUFFOLK A jewel, locked into the woefull’st cask 1041</p>
<p>That ever did contain a thing of worth:</p>
<p>Even as a splitted bark 1042 , so sunder we 1043 :</p>
<p>This way fall I to death.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET This way for me</p>
<p>Exeunt [severally 1044 ]</p>
