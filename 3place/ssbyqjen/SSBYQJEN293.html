<h4 id="scene-3-running-scene-4">Scene 3 / running scene 4</h4>
<p>Enter Leontes</p>
<p>LEONTES Nor 485 night nor day no rest. It is but weakness</p>
<p>To bear the matter thus, mere weakness. If</p>
<p>The cause were not in being 486 — part o’th’cause,</p>
<p>She, th’adulteress, for the harlot 487 king</p>
<p>Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank 488</p>
<p>And level 489 of my brain, plot-proof. But she</p>
<p>I can hook 490 to me — say that she were gone,</p>
<p>Given to the fire 491 , a moiety 492 of my rest</p>
<p>Might come to me again. Who’s there?</p>
<p>[Enter a Servant ]</p>
<p>SERVANT My lord?</p>
<p>LEONTES How does the boy?</p>
<p>SERVANT He took good rest tonight.</p>
<p>’Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.</p>
<p>LEONTES To see his nobleness!</p>
<p>Conceiving 493 the dishonour of his mother,</p>
<p>He straight declined, drooped, took it deeply,</p>
<p>Fastened and fixed the shame on’t in himself,</p>
<p>Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,</p>
<p>And downright languished. Leave me solely 494 . Go,</p>
<p>See how he fares.—</p>
<p>[Exit Servant ]</p>
<p>Fie, fie! No thought of him 495 .</p>
<p>The very thought of my revenges that way</p>
<p>Recoil upon me — in himself too mighty,</p>
<p>And in his parties, his alliance 496 . Let him be</p>
<p>Until a time may serve. For present vengeance,</p>
<p>Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes</p>
<p>Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow.</p>
<p>They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor</p>
<p>Shall she 497 within my power.</p>
<p>[Enter Paulina, carrying the baby; Antigonus and Lords enter and try
to hold her back ]</p>
<p>A LORD You must not enter.</p>
<p>PAULINA Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to 498 me.</p>
<p>Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,</p>
<p>Than the queen’s life? A gracious innocent soul,</p>
<p>More free 499 than he is jealous.</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS That’s enough.</p>
<p>SERVANT Madam, he hath not slept tonight, commanded</p>
<p>None should come at him.</p>
<p>PAULINA Not so hot 500 , good sir,</p>
<p>I come to bring him sleep 501 . ’Tis such as you,</p>
<p>That creep like shadows by him and do sigh</p>
<p>At each his needless heavings 502 , such as you</p>
<p>Nourish the cause of his awaking 503 . I</p>
<p>Do come with words as medicinal as true,</p>
<p>Honest as either 504 , to purge him of that humour 505</p>
<p>That presses him from sleep.</p>
<p>LEONTES What noise there, ho?</p>
<p>PAULINA No noise, my lord, but needful conference 506</p>
<p>About some gossips 507 for your highness.</p>
<p>LEONTES How? 508</p>
<p>Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,</p>
<p>I charged thee that she should not come about me.</p>
<p>I knew she would.</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS I told her so, my lord,</p>
<p>On your displeasure’s peril 509 and on mine,</p>
<p>She should not visit you.</p>
<p>LEONTES What? Canst not rule 510 her?</p>
<p>PAULINA From 511 all dishonesty he can. In this,</p>
<p>Unless he take the course that you have done —</p>
<p>Commit 512 me for committing honour — trust it,</p>
<p>He shall not rule me.</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS La you now 513 , you hear.</p>
<p>When she will take the rein, I let her run.</p>
<p>But she’ll not stumble.</p>
<p>PAULINA Good my liege, I come.</p>
<p>And, I beseech you hear me, who professes</p>
<p>Myself your loyal servant, your physician,</p>
<p>Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dares</p>
<p>Less appear so in comforting your evils,</p>
<p>Than such as most seem yours 514 . I say, I come</p>
<p>From your good queen 515 .</p>
<p>LEONTES Good queen?</p>
<p>PAULINA Good queen, my lord, good queen. I say good queen,</p>
<p>And would by combat make her good 516 , so were I</p>
<p>A man, the worst 517 about you.</p>
<p>LEONTES Force her hence.</p>
<p>To Lords</p>
<p>PAULINA Let him that makes but trifles 518 of his eyes</p>
<p>First hand 519 me. On mine own accord I’ll off 520 .</p>
<p>But first I’ll do my errand. The good queen,</p>
<p>For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter —</p>
<p>Here ’tis — commends it to your blessing.</p>
<p>Lays down the baby</p>
<p>LEONTES Out! 521</p>
<p>A mankind 522 witch! Hence with her, out o’door.</p>
<p>A most intelligencing bawd 523 !</p>
<p>PAULINA Not so.</p>
<p>I am as ignorant 524 in that as you</p>
<p>In so entitling 525 me, and no less honest</p>
<p>Than you are mad, which is enough, I’ll warrant 526 ,</p>
<p>As this world goes, to pass for honest.</p>
<p>LEONTES Traitors!</p>
<p>To Lords</p>
<p>Will you not push her out?— Give her the bastard.</p>
<p>To Antigonus</p>
<p>Thou dotard 527 , thou art woman-tired 528 , unroosted 529</p>
<p>By thy dame Partlet 530 here. Take up the bastard,</p>
<p>Take’t up, I say: give’t to thy crone 531 .</p>
<p>PAULINA Forever</p>
<p>To Antigonus</p>
<p>Unvenerable 532 be thy hands, if thou</p>
<p>Tak’st up the princess by that forcèd baseness</p>
<p>Which he has put upon’t 533 !</p>
<p>LEONTES He dreads 534 his wife.</p>
<p>PAULINA So I would you did. Then ’twere past all doubt</p>
<p>You’d call your children yours.</p>
<p>LEONTES A nest of traitors!</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS I am none, by this good light.</p>
<p>PAULINA Nor I, nor any</p>
<p>But one that’s here, and that’s himself, for he</p>
<p>The sacred honour of himself, his queen’s,</p>
<p>His hopeful son’s, his babe’s, betrays to slander,</p>
<p>Whose sting is sharper than the sword’s; and will not —</p>
<p>For, as the case now stands, it is a curse</p>
<p>He cannot be compelled to’t — once remove</p>
<p>The root of his opinion 535 , which is rotten</p>
<p>As ever oak or stone was sound.</p>
<p>LEONTES A callat 536</p>
<p>Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband</p>
<p>And now baits 537 me! This brat is none of mine.</p>
<p>It is the issue of Polixenes.</p>
<p>Hence with it, and together with the dam 538</p>
<p>Commit them to the fire!</p>
<p>PAULINA It is yours.</p>
<p>And, might we lay th’old proverb to your charge 539 ,</p>
<p>So like you, ’tis the worse 540 . Behold, my lords,</p>
<p>Although the print 541 be little, the whole matter 542</p>
<p>And copy of the father: eye, nose, lip,</p>
<p>The trick 543 of’s frown, his forehead, nay 544 , the valley 545
,</p>
<p>The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek, his smiles,</p>
<p>The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger.</p>
<p>And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it</p>
<p>So like to him that got 546 it, if thou hast</p>
<p>The ordering of the mind 547 too, ’mongst all colours</p>
<p>No yellow 548 in’t, lest she suspect, as he does,</p>
<p>Her children not her husband’s!</p>
<p>LEONTES A gross hag 549 .</p>
<p>And, lozel 550 , thou art worthy to be hanged,</p>
<p>To Antigonus</p>
<p>That wilt not stay her tongue 551 .</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS Hang all the husbands</p>
<p>That cannot do that feat, you’ll leave yourself</p>
<p>Hardly one subject.</p>
<p>LEONTES Once more, take her hence.</p>
<p>PAULINA A most unworthy and unnatural lord</p>
<p>Can do no more.</p>
<p>LEONTES I’ll ha’ thee burnt.</p>
<p>PAULINA I care not:</p>
<p>It is an heretic that makes the fire,</p>
<p>Not she which burns in’t 552 . I’ll not call you tyrant.</p>
<p>But this most cruel usage of your queen —</p>
<p>Not able to produce more accusation</p>
<p>Than your own weak-hinged fancy 553 — something savours 554</p>
<p>Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,</p>
<p>Yea, scandalous to the world.</p>
<p>LEONTES On your allegiance,</p>
<p>To Antigonus</p>
<p>Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,</p>
<p>Where were her life? 555 She durst not call me so,</p>
<p>If she did know me one. Away with her!</p>
<p>PAULINA I pray you do not push me. I’ll be gone.</p>
<p>Look to your babe, my lord, ’tis yours. Jove 556 send her</p>
<p>A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands? 557</p>
<p>You 558 that are thus so tender o’er his follies</p>
<p>Will never do him good, not one of you.</p>
<p>So, so. Farewell, we are gone.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>LEONTES Thou, traitor, hast set on 559 thy wife to this.</p>
<p>To Antigonus</p>
<p>My child? Away with’t! Even thou, that hast</p>
<p>A heart so tender o’er it, take it hence</p>
<p>And see it instantly consumed with fire.</p>
<p>Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight 560 .</p>
<p>Within this hour bring me word ’tis done,</p>
<p>And by good testimony 561 , or I’ll seize thy life,</p>
<p>With what thou else call’st thine. If thou refuse</p>
<p>And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;</p>
<p>The bastard brains with these my proper 562 hands</p>
<p>Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire,</p>
<p>For thou set’st on thy wife.</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS I did not, sir.</p>
<p>These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,</p>
<p>Can clear me in’t.</p>
<p>LORDS We can. My royal liege,</p>
<p>He is not guilty of her coming hither.</p>
<p>LEONTES You’re liars all.</p>
<p>A LORD Beseech your highness, give us better credit 563 .</p>
<p>We have always truly served you, and beseech’ 564</p>
<p>So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,</p>
<p>As recompense of our dear 565 services</p>
<p>Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,</p>
<p>Which being so horrible, so bloody, must</p>
<p>Lead on to some foul issue 566 . We all kneel.</p>
<p>LEONTES I am a feather for each wind that blows 567 .</p>
<p>Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel</p>
<p>And call me father? Better burn it now</p>
<p>Than curse it then. But be it. Let it live.</p>
<p>It shall not neither.— You, sir, come you hither.</p>
<p>To Antigonus</p>
<p>You that have been so tenderly officious</p>
<p>With Lady Margery 568 , your midwife there,</p>
<p>To save this bastard’s life — for ’tis a bastard,</p>
<p>So sure as this beard’s grey 569 — what will you adventure 570</p>
<p>To save this brat’s life?</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS Anything, my lord,</p>
<p>That my ability may undergo</p>
<p>And nobleness impose. At least thus much:</p>
<p>I’ll pawn the little blood which I have left</p>
<p>To save the innocent. Anything possible.</p>
<p>LEONTES It shall be possible. Swear by this sword</p>
<p>Holds out sword</p>
<p>Thou wilt perform my bidding.</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS I will, my lord.</p>
<p>LEONTES Mark and perform it, see’st thou! For the fail</p>
<p>Of any point in’t shall not only be</p>
<p>Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued 571 wife,</p>
<p>Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin 572 thee,</p>
<p>As thou art liege-man 573 to us, that thou carry</p>
<p>This female bastard hence and that thou bear it</p>
<p>To some remote and desert 574 place quite out</p>
<p>Of our dominions; and that there thou leave it,</p>
<p>Without more mercy, to it 575 own protection</p>
<p>And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune 576</p>
<p>It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,</p>
<p>On thy soul’s peril and thy body’s torture,</p>
<p>That thou commend it strangely to some place 577</p>
<p>Where chance may nurse or end it 578 . Take it up.</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS I swear to do this, though a present 579 death</p>
<p>Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe.</p>
<p>Takes up baby</p>
<p>Some powerful spirit instruct the kites 580 and ravens 581</p>
<p>To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say,</p>
<p>Casting their savageness aside, have done</p>
<p>Like 582 offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous</p>
<p>In more 583 than this deed does require 584 ; — and blessing</p>
<p>Against this cruelty fight on thy 585 side,</p>
<p>Poor thing, condemned to loss!</p>
<p>Exit [with the baby ]</p>
<p>LEONTES No, I’ll not rear</p>
<p>Another’s issue.</p>
<p>Enter a Servant</p>
<p>SERVANT Please your highness, posts 586</p>
<p>From those you sent to th’oracle are come</p>
<p>An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,</p>
<p>Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,</p>
<p>Hasting to th’court.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD So please you, sir, their speed</p>
<p>Hath been beyond account 587 .</p>
<p>LEONTES Twenty-three days</p>
<p>They have been absent: ’tis good speed, foretells</p>
<p>The great Apollo suddenly 588 will have</p>
<p>The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords.</p>
<p>Summon a session 589 , that we may arraign 590</p>
<p>Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath</p>
<p>Been publicly accused, so shall she have</p>
<p>A just and open trial. While she lives</p>
<p>My heart will be a burden to me. Leave me,</p>
<p>And think upon my bidding.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
