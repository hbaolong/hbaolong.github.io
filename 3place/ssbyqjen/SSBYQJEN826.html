<h4 id="introduction-to-the-three-parts-of-henry-the-sixth">Introduction
to The Three Parts of Henry the Sixth</h4>
<p>Henry V ends with the Chorus speaking an epilogue in sonnet form. It
offers a forward look that somewhat deflates the triumph of Agincourt.
King Henry, the ‘star of England’, will live but a small time. ‘The
world’s best garden’, having been brought to order by his charismatic
arts, will soon be choked with weeds. His son will be crowned King of
France and England whilst still an infant. So many rivals then had the
managing of his state ‘That they lost France and made his England bleed,
/ Which oft our stage hath shown.’ Shakespeare thus reminds his audience
that his cycle of history plays is complete: the sequence from Richard
II to Henry V at this point joins on to the earlier written tetralogy of
the three parts of Henry the Sixth and Richard III . Sometimes gathered
together in modern productions under a title such as The Wars of the
Roses or The Plantagenets , these plays tell the story of England’s
self-scarring and ‘dire division’.</p>
<p>In The First Part of Henry the Sixth , Henry V’s miraculous conquest
of France goes into reverse, despite the exploits of the noble Talbot;
meanwhile civil war brews at home. In The Second Part , the war with
France is brought to an end by the marriage of King Henry VI to Margaret
of Anjou, but the weak king cannot prevent the rise of the Yorkist
faction. At the beginning of The Third Part , the succession is
surrendered to Richard Duke of York, but his ascendancy is halted on a
Yorkshire battlefield, where Queen Margaret brings his life to an
undignified end; his sons spend the rest of the play avenging him – and
of those sons it is Richard of Gloucester, the future Richard III, who
proves most unscrupulous and therefore most to be feared.</p>
<p>The Romantic poet and Shakespearean commentator Samuel Taylor
Coleridge did not think well of this bloody triple-header. He said of
the opening lines of The First Part , ‘if you do not feel the
impossibility of this speech having been written by Shakespeare, all I
dare suggest is, that you may have ears – for so has another animal –
but an ear you cannot have’. To his own finely-tuned ear for poetry, the
rhythm of the verse was crude and far inferior to that of even
Shakespeare’s earliest plays. Coleridge was lecturing on Shakespeare
only a few years after the publication of Edmond Malone’s scholarly
Dissertation on the Three Parts of King Henry VI, tending to show that
these plays were not written originally by Shakespeare . Ever since
Shakespeare rose in the course of the eighteenth century to his status
as supreme cultural icon, there has been a tendency to assume that any
less than perfect work – Titus Andronicus , say, or Pericles – must have
been the product of some lesser dramatist, or at the very least that
Shakespeare was merely patching up a rickety old play for which he was
not originally responsible. In the case of the Henry the Sixth plays,
support for the latter possibility seemed to come from the existence of
early editions of versions of the second and third parts under the
titles The First Part of the Contention of the two Famous Houses of York
and Lancaster with the Death of the Good Duke Humphrey (published in
1594) and The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York and the Death of Good
King Henry the Sixth, with the Whole Contention between the two houses
Lancaster and York (1595). Malone and his successors argued that these
were the originals, written by another dramatist (probably one of the
so-called ‘university wits’, Robert Greene or George Peele), and that
Shakespeare merely undertook the work of a reviser. As for The First
Part of Henry the Sixth , Malone regarded it as almost wholly
un-Shakespearean. Though grounded in textual scholarship, his arguments
were driven by critical distaste for the plays’ style of verse, the
‘stately march’ whereby ‘the sense concludes or pauses uniformly at the
end of every line’.</p>
<p>More recently, scholars have suggested that The First Part of the
Contention and Richard Duke of York are in fact texts of works by
Shakespeare, albeit poorly transcribed ones. The titles The First Part
and The Whole Contention strongly suggest that the plays that we now
call The Second Part and The Third Part of Henry the Sixth originally
constituted a two-part work. They were probably first produced in the
early 1590s, when Christopher Marlowe’s mighty Tamburlaine the Great had
established a vogue for two-part plays filled with battles, processions
and high-sounding verse.</p>
<p>What we now call The First Part of Henry the Sixth would then stand
slightly apart. Since it appears to have been premiered – to
considerable acclaim – in 1592, it was probably written after the two
Wars of the Roses plays that are now called the second and third parts.
Perhaps it was what in modern film parlance is called a ‘prequel’,
designed to cash in on the success of a blockbuster. Its lack of unity
and its use of different source materials for different scenes suggest
that it may have been a collaborative work. Thomas Nashe, who also wrote
in partnership with Marlowe, has been suggested as a prime contributor,
but there may have been three or even four hands in the composition. The
possibility that Shakespeare was not the principal author of the
Talbot/Joan of Arc play would account for some of the inconsistencies in
the sequence considered as a trilogy. Among these are the fact that in
The Second Part Humphrey Duke of Gloucester is a statesmanlike figure, a
Lord Protector worthy of his late brother Henry V, whereas in The First
Part he is more rough-hewn, and the plot discrepancy whereby the
surrender of Anjou and Maine, a condition of the marriage between King
Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou, is much resented in The Second Part yet
not challenged in the marriage negotiations in The First Part .</p>
<p>There is a long tradition of attempting to establish literary
authorship by stylistic tests – preference for feminine endings in verse
lines, contractions (them versus ’em ), frequency of grammatical
function words, and so forth. The availability of large-scale databases
of texts and computer programs to crunch them means that such tests are
becoming ever more sophisticated and reliable. When several different
tests give the same result, one can speak tentatively of the evidence
attaining scientific standards of probability. Twenty-first-century
stylometric research of this kind suggests that nearly all of The Second
Part can be confidently attributed to Shakespeare, that there are some
doubts about The Third Part and that Shakespeare probably only wrote a
few scenes of The First Part . Perhaps the only thing that makes one
hesitate about these results is that they seem too convenient, in that
they so neatly mirror the consensus about the relative dramatic quality
of the three plays: The Second Part has gloriously Shakespearean energy
and variety, and nearly always works superbly in the theatre; The Third
Part has some immensely powerful rhetorical encounters but many
longueurs ; The First Part is generally the least admired – save for the
rose-plucking scene in the second act and the moving dialogue of Talbot
and his son in the fourth act battle, the very sequences which the
computer tests ascribe to Shakespeare.</p>
<p>It cannot be determined whether the traces of non-Shakespearean
language are the vestiges of older plays that Shakespeare was revising
or whether they are signs of active collaboration. Nor do we know
whether the plays were ever staged as a trilogy in Shakespeare’s
lifetime. They only came to be labelled as such in the posthumously
published 1623 Folio, where all his histories were collected and ordered
by the chronology of their subject matter as opposed to their
composition. Since the charismatic villain Richard of Gloucester appears
in The Second Part and The Third Part , it becomes very tempting to
think of the whole group as a tetralogy capped by The Tragedy of Richard
the Third . Perhaps the best approach is to try to treat each of the
plays both on its own terms – they were, after all, designed to be
performed one at a time – and as part of Shakespeare’s unfolding
panorama of English history.</p>
<p>Richard III , probably first staged between 1592 and 1594, does seem
to represent a quantum leap in Shakespeare’s dramatic art. Whilst
Crookback Richard has been a role that has made the names of great
actors from David Garrick in the eighteenth century to Edmund Kean in
the nineteenth to Antony Sher in the twentieth, the Henry the Sixth
plays have not fared well on the English (or any other) stage. The
second and third parts were given a few outings in heavily adapted and
compressed form between the Restoration and Regency periods, but almost
three hundred years elapsed before there was a full-scale revival of the
entire sequence, and even the twentieth century, which restored to
favour such previously unpopular early Shakespearean plays as Love’s
Labour’s Lost and Titus Andronicus , only saw some half-dozen major
productions: those of F. R. Benson at the beginning of the century, Sir
Barry Jackson shortly after the Second World War, John Barton and Peter
Hall (rewritten and compressed into two plays under the title The Wars
of the Roses ) at Stratford-upon-Avon in the early 1960s, Terry Hands
and Adrian Noble in succeeding decades at Stratford (the latter reducing
the tetralogy to a trilogy entitled The Plantagenets ), and Michael
Bogdanov as part of a brave attempt to stage all of the history plays in
modern dress, with a strong anti-Thatcherite political agenda, for the
touring English Shakespeare Company in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The early twenty-first century, however, witnessed a reversal of
fortune: Michael Boyd directed a much-admired version with full texts
under the title This England in the intimate space of the Swan theatre
in Stratford-upon-Avon, then on becoming Artistic Director of the Royal
Shakespeare Company revived his productions on a larger stage. Edward
Hall, meanwhile, followed his father Peter in reducing three to two,
with an energetic version set in a slaughterhouse and entitled Rose Rage
. In a new millennium, at a time of renewed religious war and deep
uncertainty about the meaning of nation and national identity,
Shakespeare’s exploration of the foundations of the fractured Tudor
polity seemed powerfully prescient.</p>
<p>The Henry the Sixth plays reveal Shakespeare learning his art with
great rapidity. Poetic styles and stage business are snapped up from the
university men, source material from the prose chronicles of English
history. Edward Hall’s Union of the Two Noble and Illustrious Families
of Lancaster and York (1548) is compressed in such a way as to give a
pattern to the march of history. The action is concerned less with
individual characters than with the roles that individuals play in the
drama of the nation’s destiny. Shakespeare is quite willing to change
someone’s age or even their nature in order to subordinate them to his
overall scheme. The demonization of Richard of Gloucester is only the
most striking example. Whereas we associate the mature Shakespeare with
contemplation – King Harry or Prince Hamlet in troubled soliloquy – the
driving force of these early plays is action. The First Part deploys a
set of variations on an underlying structure in which dramatic action
precedes explanation, then a scene will end with epigrammatic
recapitulation; each scene is presented in such a way that a different
character’s viewpoint is emphasized or a new aspect of an existing
character developed. The scene with Talbot in the Countess of Auvergne’s
castle, for instance, highlights the courtesy and prudence of a man who
has previously been seen as the exemplar of heroic courage. It also
provides a contrast against which the later confrontation of Suffolk and
Margaret can be measured: Talbot is a relic from the days of Henry V and
England’s conquest of France, while Suffolk is a harbinger of division
and the Wars of the Roses.</p>
<p>In The Second Part , Shakespeare used a structural pattern to which
he returned in later tragedies such as King Lear and Timon of Athens :
the hero, Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, is progressively isolated as
prominence is given to the legalistic conspiracies of his malicious
enemies. But since the subject is the nation, not an individual hero,
Humphrey is dispatched in the third act, and the remainder of the play
turns to the subject of rebellion (Jack Cade’s proletarian rising in Act
4) and attempted usurpation (the altogether more dangerous Duke of
York’s march on London). The Third Part begins in chaos, with each of
the first two acts ending in a battle (at Wakefield, then Towton), then
proceeds in an uneasy equilibrium which sees two kings alive
simultaneously and their respective claims only resolved after a
bewildering series of encounters, parleys and changes of allegiance.</p>
<p>Balanced scene structure is paralleled by formal rhetorical style.
The formality of the world of these plays is also apparent from the use
of dramatic tableaux. The civil strife of the Wars of the Roses could
have no better epitome than the paired entrances in Act 2 scene 5 of The
Third Part , where a son that has killed his father appears at one stage
door and a moment later a father that has killed his son emerges through
the other. Their entry rudely interrupts King Henry’s meditation on how
he only wants a quiet life, how he’d rather be a shepherd than a king.
The aspirations of the weak but pious king are formally visualized in
the stage direction for his next entry, in Act 3 scene 1: ‘Enter King
Henry, disguised, carrying a prayer-book.’ Only in retreat and disguise
can he fulfil his desire to be a holy man. And even then his peace lasts
only an instant, for two gamekeepers overhear and apprehend him, taking
him to captivity in the hands of usurping King Edward. By contrast, when
Richard of Gloucester becomes King Richard in the next play, a
prayer-book is itself a form of disguise.</p>
<p>The unifying theme that makes the plays work as a trilogy, whatever
the circumstances of their origin, is the pitching of two world-pictures
against each other. Opposites cannot co-exist in harmony, so chaos
ensues. In The First Part the opposition takes the form of French
against English, Joan against Talbot, magical thinking against
rationality, female against male, and implicitly Catholic against
Protestant. The historical Talbot was a Catholic, but to an audience in
the early 1590s, his plainspeaking Englishness and his heroic deeds on
the continental mainland would inevitably have evoked the knightly
warriors such as Sir Philip Sidney who fought with Robert Dudley, Earl
of Leicester, in the religious wars of the 1580s in the Spanish
Netherlands. Joan, meanwhile, is a figure familiar from anti-Catholic
propaganda: a virgin branded whore (‘pucelle’ means ‘maiden’ but
‘puzzel’ connotes prostitute), a saint and martyr converted into a
conjuror of devils, a figure linked to Papist veneration of the Virgin
Mary by way of the suggestion of miraculous pregnancy.</p>
<p>The dialectic of The Second Part pits honest old Duke Humphrey of
Gloucester and pious young King Henry VI against the scheming
Plantagenets. Richard Duke of York’s brain, ‘more busy than the
labouring spider’, ‘weaves tedious snares to trap’ his enemies; his son
Richard, future Duke of Gloucester and eventual Richard III, will
develop both this kind of language and his father’s strategizing to
chilling effect. As various characters shift allegiance between the
houses of York and Lancaster, so audience sympathies shift as the
fast-moving action unfolds: the power-hungry York of The Second Part
becomes a figure of pathos when he is forced to wear a paper crown in
the final moments before he is stabbed to death in The Third Part .</p>
<p>Shakespeare does not reveal his own allegiances, but he knows the
direction in which history is moving. A key incident in this regard is
the fake miracle of Simpcox in The Second Part : King Henry is taken in,
a mark of his naive faith, whereas Humphrey of Gloucester adopts the
sceptical, interrogative voice of a witchfinder – for which the
contemporary equivalent would have been a seeker after closet Catholics.
Revealingly, the source for this scene was not the pro-Tudor chronicle
of Edward Hall but the anti-Catholic martyrology of John Foxe. Other
‘medieval’, and thus implicitly Catholic, elements are also subverted:
the Duchess of Gloucester’s reliance on conjuration and the trial by
combat between the armourer Horner and his man Peter both backfire.</p>
<p>Protestantism, with its rejection of the hierarchies of saints and
cardinals, its commitment to the Bible in the language of the people,
was associated with a democratization of religious faith. The Second
Part is the element of the trilogy that toys with the popular voice
(hence its significant proportion of prose writing, which is entirely
absent from the first and third parts), but it cannot be said to endorse
a modern notion of democracy. Jack Cade is a highly attractive figure on
stage because he speaks in the same language as the commoners in the
audience; his clowning offers welcome respite from the high rhetoric and
low cunning of the aristocrats, and such lines as ‘the first thing we
do, let’s kill all the lawyers’ elicit an approving laugh in every age.
But Shakespeare, who made his living by the literacy that his father
lacked, can hardly be said to approve of a character who orders the
hanging of a village clerk for the crime of being able to read and
write. And Cade’s vision of England is self-contradictory to the
core:</p>
<p>CADE Be brave, then, for your captain is brave, and vows reformation.
There shall be in England seven halfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the
three-hooped pot shall have ten hoops, and I will make it felony to
drink small beer. All the realm shall be in common, and in Cheapside
shall my palfrey go to grass: and when I am king, as king I will be—</p>
<p>ALL God save your majesty!</p>
<p>This is a double-edged ‘reformation’: cheap bread, unwatered ale and
the land held in common sound Utopian, but Cade does not really want
representative government. He wants to be king himself. Shakespeare
plays the same trick against the ‘commonwealth’ idealism of the courtier
Gonzalo twenty years later in The Tempest : ‘No sovereignty— / Yet he
would be king on’t.’ If Shakespeare has an Eden, it is not a place
anterior to class distinction on the lines of the old rhyme ‘When Adam
delved and Eve span / Who was then the gentleman?’ but rather an English
gentleman’s country estate, a place of peace and retreat where Cade is
an intruder: the Kentish garden of Alexander Iden.</p>
<p>There is a primal quality to the three plays of Henry the Sixth . The
basis of drama is agon , the Greek word for ‘struggle’ or ‘contest’.
According to Aristotle, the origin of tragedy was the moment when an
actor split off from a chorus and began to enter into dialogue with
them. Later came a second actor and a further opportunity for
confrontation – the term for the first actor was ‘protagonist’ and the
second ‘deuteragonist’. Conversation in the theatre of historical
tragedy is always a form of agon , which rapidly escalates into
emotional intensity (agony) and thence to physical violence.
Shakespeare, with his highly self-conscious theatrical art, is always
acutely aware of the several agons that co-exist in the theatre: between
the actor and his role (the struggle to master a part), between the
players and the audience (the struggle to grab attention, to move a
crowd of onlookers to woe and wonder), within each individual character
(the play of conflicting desires and duties), as well as between the
characters in their dialogue and stage disposition.</p>
<p>War is the logical culmination of an agonistic world: it is the
beginning and end of the three parts of Henry the Sixth . The process of
escalation is such that The Third Part in particular portrays the
complete breakdown of society. The play has the harrowing, relentless
quality of Greek tragedy, where people live and die according to a code
of revenge, the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children, and
the language moves between rhetorical, proto-operatic arias of anger,
anguish, invective, and rapid-fire one-line exchanges in which the
brutal conflicts between Lancastrians and Yorkists, men and women, old
and young, self-servers and seekers after justice, winners and losers,
are stripped to their essentials. In this world, words are weapons, but
just occasionally they are harbingers of hope, as when King Henry VI
lays his hands on young Henry Richmond’s head and says:</p>
<p>Come hither, England’s hope. If secret powers</p>
<p>Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,</p>
<p>This pretty lad will prove our country’s bliss.</p>
<p>His looks are full of peaceful majesty,</p>
<p>His head by nature framed to wear a crown,</p>
<p>His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself</p>
<p>Likely in time to bless a regal throne.</p>
<p>Make much of him, my lords, for this is he</p>
<p>Must help you more than you are hurt by me.</p>
<p>This anointing looks forward to the establishment of the Tudor
dynasty when Richmond becomes Henry VII, Queen Elizabeth’s grandfather.
But, as always seems to happen at moments of apparent stasis in these
plays, a messenger then rushes on with the news that the rival king,
Edward, has escaped. The violence continues apace. And before the final
victory of Richmond at Bosworth Field, England must endure the darkness
and blood of Crookback Richard’s reign, to which Shakespeare will turn
his attention in his next tragedy.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS: THE THIRD PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH</p>
<p>AUTHORSHIP: Inclusion in the Folio and Chettle/Greene’s ‘upstart
crow’ jibe (see ‘Date’, below) are presumptions in favour of
Shakespeare’s authorship, but stylometric tests raise grave doubts about
his sole authorship. Peele, Greene and Nashe have been suggested as
possible contributors. There is no scholarly consensus on the question,
which is closely related to the problem of the nature of the Octavo text
(see below).</p>
<p>PLOT: Having won the battle of St Albans and with Richard Plantagenet
sitting on the throne of England, the Yorkists confront the
Lancastrians. King Henry, to his wife’s dismay, agrees to York’s demand
that he disinherit his son, Edward, Prince of Wales. Margaret vows to
destroy York and his followers. She enlists the support of Clifford and
others to raise an army. Margaret’s forces meet with those of York in
battle, during which York’s youngest son, Rutland, is killed by
Clifford. York is then captured by Clifford and Northumberland, taunted
with details of Rutland’s death and brutally murdered. Edward and
Richard are informed of their father’s murder and unite with Warwick,
who proclaims Edward the new Duke of York. They raise an army and defeat
the Lancastrians at Towton. Henry, Margaret and their son are forced to
flee north; Clifford is killed. Henry is captured and brought to London,
where he is placed in the Tower by the new King Edward. In France,
Margaret and Warwick meet at the court of King Lewis. News reaches them
that Edward has married Lady Elizabeth Grey, in spite of his earlier
betrothal, instigated by Warwick, to King Lewis’ sister, Lady Bona. This
insult turns both Warwick and Lewis against Edward. Warwick pledges
support to Margaret, releasing Henry from the Tower and reinstating him
as King of England. Warwick leaves London to muster his army, during
which time Edward returns and recaptures Henry. The forces of Edward and
Warwick meet at Barnet, where Warwick is killed. Margaret arrives in
England with reinforcements. Her forces encounter Edward’s for the last
time at Tewkesbury, where, after much bloodshed, the Wars of the Roses
seem finally to be over.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Edward, Earl of March/King Edward IV (15%/132/18), Earl of
Warwick (15%/99/12), Richard/Duke of Gloucester (14%/108/17), King Henry
VI (12%/71/7), Queen Margaret (10%/53/7), Richard, Duke of York
(6%/37/3), Lord Clifford (5%/35/6), George/Duke of Clarence (4%/39/12),
Lady Elizabeth Grey/Queen Elizabeth (3%/31/4), King Lewis XI (2%/21/1),
Edward, Prince of Wales (2%/16/6).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 100% verse.</p>
<p>DATE: 1591? York’s line ‘O, tiger’s heart wrapt in a woman’s hide!’
is parodied in Greene’s Groatsworth of Wit (a pamphlet prepared for the
press – entered for publication September 1592 – by Henry Chettle,
perhaps based in part on the papers of the late dramatist Robert
Greene), where Shakespeare is described as an ‘upstart crow, beautified
with our feathers, that with his Tiger’s heart wrapped in a player’s
hide , supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the
best of you’. Pembroke’s Men, who played the Octavo version, were active
in 1592. The possibility of an earlier pre-Shakespearean version and a
later Shakespearean revision cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Based primarily on Edward Hall, The Union of the Two Noble
and Illustre Famelies of Lancastre and Yorke (1548) and the second
(1587) edition of Holinshed’s Chronicles . In some details, the Octavo
text seems to follow Hall and the Folio Holinshed, which may support the
theory of revision (see below).</p>
<p>TEXT: A short version was published in Octavo form in 1595, entitled
The true Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke, and the death of good King
Henrie the Sixt, with the whole contention betweene the two Houses
Lancaster and Yorke, as it was sundrie times acted by the Right
Honourable the Earle of Pembrooke his seruants , reprinted in Quarto in
1600 and, with attribution to Shakespeare and title combined with that
of the previous play, 1619 (The Whole Contention betweene the two Famous
Houses, Lancaster and Yorke ). The Octavo text is a reconstruction of a
playing version, but there is much dispute over whether it is a short
and often poorly remembered version of the play that is preserved in
full in the Folio or the text of an early version (not by Shakespeare?
partly by Shakespeare?) that Shakespeare then revised into the play that
was printed in the Folio. It is equally unclear whether the linguistic
signs of a non- Shakespearean hand (or hands) in the Folio text are
vestiges of an older version or the result of active
collaboration/co-authorship. We use the Folio text, which has the
authority of Heminge and Condell, though the nature of the copy from
which it was set is disputed. The Octavo remains valuable for certain
details of staging.</p>
