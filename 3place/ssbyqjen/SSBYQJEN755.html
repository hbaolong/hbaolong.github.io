continues</h4>
<p>Enter Fluellen and Gower</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Kill the poys 1626 and the luggage 1627 ! ’Tis expressly
against the law of arms. ’Tis as arrant a piece of knavery, mark you
now, as can be offer’t 1628 , in your conscience, now, is it not?</p>
<p>GOWER ‘Tis certain there’s not a boy left alive, and the cowardly
rascals that ran from the battle ha’ done this slaughter. Besides, they
have burned and carried away all that was in the king’s tent, wherefore
1629 the king, most worthily 1630 , hath caused every soldier to cut his
prisoner’s throat. O, ’tis a gallant king!</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Ay, he was porn at Monmouth 1631 , Captain Gower. What call
you the town’s name where Alexander the Pig 1632 was born?</p>
<p>GOWER Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Why, I pray you, is not ‘pig’ great? The pig, or the great,
or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous, are all one reckonings
1633 , save the phrase is a little variations 1634 .</p>
<p>GOWER I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon 1635 , his
father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take 1636 it.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I tell
you, captain, if you look in the maps of the ’orld 1637 , I warrant you
sall find, in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth, that the
situations 1638 , look you, is both alike. There is a river in Macedon,
and there is also moreover a river at Monmouth: it is called Wye 1639 at
Monmouth, but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other
river. But ’tis all one, ’tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers, and
there is salmons in both 1640 . If you mark Alexander’s life well, Harry
of Monmouth’s life is come after it 1641 indifferent well, for there is
figures 1642 in all things. Alexander, God knows, and you know, in his
rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers 1643 and his moods
and his displeasures and his indignations and also being a little
intoxicates 1644 in his prains, did, in his ales 1645 and his angers,
look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus 1646 .</p>
<p>GOWER Our king is not like him in that: he never killed any of his
friends.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN It is not well done, mark you now, to take the tales out of
my mouth ere it is made and finished. I speak but in the figures and
comparisons of it: as Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his
ales and his cups 1647 , so also Harry Monmouth, being in his right wits
and his good judgements, turned away the fat knight with the great
belly-doublet 1648 . He was full of jests and gipes 1649 and knaveries
1650 and mocks 1651 —— I have forgot his name.</p>
<p>GOWER Sir John Falstaff.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN That is he. I’ll tell you there is good men porn at
Monmouth.</p>
<p>GOWER Here comes his majesty.</p>
<p>Alarum. Enter King Harry and Bourbon [and others ] with prisoners.
Flourish</p>
<p>KING HENRY V I was not angry since I came to France</p>
<p>Until this instant 1652 . Take a trumpet 1653 , herald,</p>
<p>Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill:</p>
<p>If they will fight with us, bid them come down,</p>
<p>Or void the field: they do offend our sight.</p>
<p>If they’ll do neither, we will come to them</p>
<p>And make them skirr 1654 away, as swift as stones</p>
<p>Enforcèd 1655 from the old Assyrian slings.</p>
<p>Besides 1656 , we’ll cut the throats of those 1657 we have,</p>
<p>And not a man of them that we shall take 1658</p>
<p>Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.</p>
<p>Enter Montjoy</p>
<p>EXETER Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER His eyes are humbler than they used to be.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V How now? What means this, herald? Know’st thou not</p>
<p>That I have fined 1659 these bones 1660 of mine for ransom?</p>
<p>Com’st thou again for ransom?</p>
<p>MONTJOY No, great king:</p>
<p>I come to thee for charitable licence 1661 ,</p>
<p>That we may wander o’er this bloody field</p>
<p>To book 1662 our dead and then to bury them,</p>
<p>To sort our nobles from our common men.</p>
<p>For many of our princes —— woe the while! ——</p>
<p>Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary 1663 blood,</p>
<p>So do our vulgar 1664 drench their peasant limbs</p>
<p>In blood of princes, and our wounded steeds</p>
<p>Fret 1665 fetlock-deep 1666 in gore and with wild rage</p>
<p>Yerk 1667 out their armèd heels 1668 at their dead masters,</p>
<p>Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,</p>
<p>To view the field in safety and dispose</p>
<p>Of their dead bodies!</p>
<p>KING HENRY V I tell thee truly, herald,</p>
<p>I know not if the day 1669 be ours or no,</p>
<p>For yet a many of your horsemen peer 1670</p>
<p>And gallop o’er the field.</p>
<p>MONTJOY The day is yours.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!——</p>
<p>What is this castle called that stands hard 1671 by?</p>
<p>MONTJOY They call it Agincourt.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Then call we this the field of Agincourt,</p>
<p>Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Your grandfather of famous memory 1672 , an’t 1673 please
your majesty, and your great-uncle Edward the Plack Prince of Wales, as
I have read in the chronicles 1674 , fought a most prave pattle here in
France.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V They did, Fluellen.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Your majesty says very true: if your majesties is remembered
of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow,
wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps 1675 , which, your majesty know, to
this hour is an honourable badge 1676 of the service, and I do believe
your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy’s 1677
day.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V I wear it for a memorable honour 1678 ,</p>
<p>For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN All the water in Wye cannot wash your majesty’s Welsh plood
out of your pody, I can tell you that. God pless it and preserve it, as
long as it pleases his grace 1679 , and his majesty too!</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Thanks, good my countryman.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN By Jeshu, I am your majesty’s countryman, I care not who
know it. I will confess it to all the ’orld. I need not to be ashamed of
your majesty, praised be God, so long as your majesty is an honest
man.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V God keep me so!</p>
<p>Enter Williams</p>
<p>Our heralds go with him.</p>
<p>Bring me just notice of the numbers dead</p>
<p>On both our parts.——</p>
<p>[Exeunt Heralds with Montjoy ]</p>
<p>Call yonder fellow hither.</p>
<p>Points to Williams</p>
<p>EXETER Soldier, you must come to the king.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Soldier, why wear’st thou that glove in thy cap?</p>
<p>WILLIAMS An’t please your majesty, ’tis the gage 1680 of one that I
should fight withal, if he be alive.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V An Englishman?</p>
<p>WILLIAMS An’t please your majesty, a rascal that swaggered 1681 with
me last night, who, if alive and ever dare to challenge 1682 this glove,
I have sworn to take him a box o’th’ear, or if I can see my glove in his
cap, which he swore as he was a soldier he would wear if alive, I will
strike it out soundly.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V What think you, Captain Fluellen? Is it fit 1683 this
soldier keep his oath?</p>
<p>FLUELLEN He is a craven 1684 and a villain else 1685 , an’t please
your majesty, in my conscience.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort 1686 ,
quite from the answer of his degree 1687 .</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, as Lucifer
and Beelzebub 1688 himself, it is necessary, look your grace, that he
keep his vow and his oath: if he be perjured, see you now, his
reputation is as arrant a villain and a jack-sauce 1689 as ever his
black 1690 shoe trod upon God’s ground and his earth, in my conscience,
la!</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Then keep thy vow, sirrah 1691 , when thou meet’st the
fellow.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS So I will, my liege, as I live.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Who servest thou under?</p>
<p>WILLIAMS Under Captain Gower, my liege.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Gower is 1692 a good captain, and is good knowledge and
literatured 1693 in the wars.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Call him hither to me, soldier.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS I will, my liege.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Here, Fluellen, wear thou this favour 1694 for me and
stick it in thy cap. When Alençon 1695 and myself were down 1696
together, I plucked this glove from his helm 1697 : if any man challenge
this, he is a friend to Alençon and an enemy to our person; if thou
encounter any such, apprehend 1698 him, an thou dost me love 1699 .</p>
<p>Gives him</p>
<p>Williams’ glove</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Your grace does me as great honours as can be desired in the
hearts of his subjects. I would fain 1700 see the man that has but two
legs 1701 that shall find himself aggriefed at this glove; that is all.
But I would fain see it 1702 once, an please God of his grace that I
might see.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Know’st thou Gower?</p>
<p>FLUELLEN He is my dear friend, an please you.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Pray thee go seek him, and bring him to my tent.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN I will fetch him.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KING HENRY V My lord of Warwick, and my brother Gloucester,</p>
<p>Follow Fluellen closely at the heels.</p>
<p>The glove which I have given him for a favour</p>
<p>May haply 1703 purchase him a box o’th’ear.</p>
<p>It is the soldier’s, I by bargain should</p>
<p>Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick:</p>
<p>If that the soldier strike him, as I judge</p>
<p>By his blunt 1704 bearing he will keep his word,</p>
<p>Some sudden mischief 1705 may arise of it,</p>
<p>For I do know Fluellen valiant</p>
<p>And, touched 1706 with choler 1707 , hot as gunpowder,</p>
<p>And quickly will return an injury.</p>
<p>Follow and see there be no harm between them.</p>
<p>Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
