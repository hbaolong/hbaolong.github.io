<h4 id="scene-1-2-running-scene-1">Scene 1 2 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter King John 3 , Queen Elinor 4 , Pembroke, Essex and Salisbury,
with the Chatillon of France</p>
<p>KING JOHN Now, say, Chatillon, what would France 5 with us?</p>
<p>CHATILLON Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France,</p>
<p>In my behaviour 6 , to the majesty 7 ,</p>
<p>The borrowed 8 majesty, of England here.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR A strange beginning: ‘borrowed majesty’!</p>
<p>KING JOHN Silence, good mother: hear the embassy 9 .</p>
<p>CHATILLON Philip of France 10 , in right and true behalf</p>
<p>Of thy deceasèd brother Geoffrey 11 ’s son,</p>
<p>Arthur Plantagenet 12 , lays most lawful claim</p>
<p>To this fair island and the territories 13 —</p>
<p>To Ireland, Poitiers 14 , Anjou, Touraine, Maine —</p>
<p>Desiring thee to lay aside the sword 15</p>
<p>Which sways 16 usurpingly these several 17 titles,</p>
<p>And put the same into young Arthur’s hand,</p>
<p>Thy nephew, and right 18 royal sovereign.</p>
<p>KING JOHN What follows if we disallow of 19 this?</p>
<p>CHATILLON The proud control 20 of fierce and bloody war,</p>
<p>To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld—</p>
<p>KING JOHN Here have we war for war and blood for blood,</p>
<p>Controlment for controlment: so answer France.</p>
<p>CHATILLON Then take my king’s defiance from my mouth,</p>
<p>The furthest limit of my embassy 21 .</p>
<p>KING JOHN Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:</p>
<p>Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;</p>
<p>For ere 22 thou canst report 23 , I will be there:</p>
<p>The thunder of my cannon shall be heard.</p>
<p>So hence 24 : be thou the trumpet 25 of our wrath</p>
<p>And sullen presage 26 of your own decay 27 .—</p>
<p>An honourable conduct 28 let him have:</p>
<p>To Pembroke</p>
<p>Pembroke, look to’t.— Farewell, Chatillon.</p>
<p>Exeunt Chatillon and Pembroke</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR What now, my son? Have I not ever said</p>
<p>How that ambitious Constance 29 would not cease</p>
<p>Till she had kindled 30 France 31 and all the world,</p>
<p>Upon 32 the right and party 33 of her son?</p>
<p>This might have been prevented and made whole 34</p>
<p>With very easy arguments 35 of love 36 ,</p>
<p>Which now the manage 37 of two kingdoms must</p>
<p>With fearful bloody issue 38 arbitrate.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Our strong possession and our right for us.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR Your strong possession much more than your right,</p>
<p>Aside to John</p>
<p>Or else it must go wrong with you and me:</p>
<p>So much my conscience whispers in your ear,</p>
<p>Which none but heaven, and you, and I, shall hear.</p>
<p>She whispers to Essex</p>
<p>Enter a Sheriff</p>
<p>ESSEX My liege 39 , here is the strangest controversy 40 ,</p>
<p>Come from the country to be judged by you,</p>
<p>That e’er I heard: shall I produce 41 the men?</p>
<p>KING JOHN Let them approach.—</p>
<p>[Exit Sheriff ]</p>
<p>Our abbeys and our priories shall pay</p>
<p>This expeditious charge 42 .</p>
<p>Enter Robert Falconbridge and Philip [the Bastard ]</p>
<p>What men are you?</p>
<p>BASTARD Your faithful subject I, a gentleman,</p>
<p>Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,</p>
<p>As I suppose, to Robert Falconbridge,</p>
<p>A soldier, by the honour-giving hand</p>
<p>Of Coeur-de-lion 43 , knighted in the field 44 .</p>
<p>KING JOHN What art thou?</p>
<p>ROBERT The son and heir to that same Falconbridge.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?</p>
<p>You came not of one mother then, it seems.</p>
<p>BASTARD Most certain of one mother, mighty king,</p>
<p>That is well known, and, as I think, one father:</p>
<p>But for the certain knowledge of that truth</p>
<p>I put you o’er 45 to heaven 46 , and to my mother;</p>
<p>Of that I doubt, as all men’s children may.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR Out on thee 47 , rude 48 man! Thou dost shame thy
mother</p>
<p>And wound her honour with this diffidence 49 .</p>
<p>BASTARD I, madam? No, I have no reason for it.</p>
<p>That is my brother’s plea and none of mine,</p>
<p>The which if he can prove, a 50 pops me out 51</p>
<p>At least from fair 52 five hundred pound a year:</p>
<p>Heaven guard my mother’s honour and my land.</p>
<p>KING JOHN A good blunt fellow.— Why, being younger born,</p>
<p>Aside / To Bastard</p>
<p>Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?</p>
<p>BASTARD I know not why, except to get the land:</p>
<p>But once 53 he slandered me with bastardy:</p>
<p>But whe’er 54 I be as true begot 55 or no,</p>
<p>That still I lay upon my mother’s head 56 :</p>
<p>But that I am as well begot, my liege —</p>
<p>Fair fall 57 the bones that took the pains for me —</p>
<p>Compare our faces, and be judge yourself</p>
<p>If old Sir Robert did beget us both,</p>
<p>And were our father and this son like him:</p>
<p>O old Sir Robert, father, on my knee</p>
<p>I give heaven thanks I was not like 58 to thee!</p>
<p>KING JOHN Why, what a madcap 59 hath heaven lent 60 us here!</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR He hath a trick 61 of Coeur-de-lion’s face:</p>
<p>The accent of his tongue affecteth 62 him.</p>
<p>Do you not read some tokens 63 of my son</p>
<p>In the large composition 64 of this man?</p>
<p>KING JOHN Mine eye hath well examined his parts 65 ,</p>
<p>And finds them perfect Richard.— Sirrah 66 , speak,</p>
<p>To Robert</p>
<p>What doth move 67 you to claim your brother’s land?</p>
<p>BASTARD Because he hath a half-face 68 like my father.</p>
<p>With half that face 69 would he have all my land —</p>
<p>A half-faced groat 70 — five hundred pound a year!</p>
<p>ROBERT My gracious liege, when that 71 my father lived,</p>
<p>Your brother 72 did employ my father much—</p>
<p>BASTARD Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:</p>
<p>Your tale 73 must be how he employed 74 my mother.</p>
<p>ROBERT And once dispatched him in an embassy</p>
<p>To Germany, there with the emperor</p>
<p>To treat of 75 high 76 affairs touching 77 that time.</p>
<p>Th’advantage of his absence took the king,</p>
<p>And in the meantime sojourned 78 at my father’s;</p>
<p>Where how he did prevail 79 , I shame to speak.</p>
<p>But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores</p>
<p>Between my father and my mother lay,</p>
<p>As I have heard my father speak himself,</p>
<p>When this same lusty 80 gentleman was got 81 .</p>
<p>Upon his death-bed he by will bequeathed</p>
<p>His lands to me, and took it on his death 82</p>
<p>That this my mother’s son was none of his;</p>
<p>And if he were, he came into the world</p>
<p>Full fourteen weeks before the course of time 83 .</p>
<p>Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,</p>
<p>My father’s land, as was my father’s will.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Sirrah, your brother is legitimate:</p>
<p>Your father’s wife did after wedlock bear him:</p>
<p>And if she did play false 84 , the fault 85 was hers,</p>
<p>Which fault lies on the hazards 86 of all husbands</p>
<p>That marry wives. Tell me, how 87 if my brother 88 ,</p>
<p>Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,</p>
<p>Had of your father claimed this son for his?</p>
<p>In sooth 89 , good friend, your father might have kept</p>
<p>This calf, bred from his cow, from all the world 90 :</p>
<p>In sooth he might. Then if he were my brother’s,</p>
<p>My brother might not claim him, nor your father,</p>
<p>Being none of his, refuse him 91 : this concludes 92 ,</p>
<p>My mother’s son did get your father’s heir,</p>
<p>Your father’s heir must have your father’s land.</p>
<p>ROBERT Shall then my father’s will 93 be of no force</p>
<p>To dispossess that child which is not his?</p>
<p>BASTARD Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,</p>
<p>Than was his will 94 to get me, as I think.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR Whether 95 hadst thou rather be: a Falconbridge,</p>
<p>And like thy brother to enjoy thy land,</p>
<p>Or the reputed 96 son of Coeur-de-lion,</p>
<p>Lord of thy presence 97 , and no land beside?</p>
<p>BASTARD Madam, an if 98 my brother had my shape 99</p>
<p>And I had his, Sir Robert’s his like him 100 ,</p>
<p>And if my legs were two such riding-rods 101 ,</p>
<p>My arms, such eel-skins stuffed, my face so thin,</p>
<p>That in 102 mine ear I durst not stick a rose,</p>
<p>Lest men should say, ‘Look, where three-farthings 103 goes’,</p>
<p>And to his shape 104 were heir to all this land,</p>
<p>Would I might 105 never stir from off this place,</p>
<p>I would give it every foot 106 to have this 107 face:</p>
<p>It would not be Sir Nob 108 in any case 109 .</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,</p>
<p>Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?</p>
<p>I am a soldier and now bound to France.</p>
<p>BASTARD Brother, take you my land, I’ll take my chance.</p>
<p>Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,</p>
<p>Yet sell your face for five pence and ’tis dear 110 .—</p>
<p>Madam, I’ll follow you unto the death.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR Nay, I would have you go before me thither 111 .</p>
<p>BASTARD Our country manners give our betters way 112 .</p>
<p>KING JOHN What is thy name?</p>
<p>BASTARD Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,</p>
<p>Philip, good old sir Robert’s wife’s eldest son.</p>
<p>KING JOHN From henceforth bear his name whose form 113 thou
bear’st:</p>
<p>Kneel thou down Philip, but rise 114 more great,</p>
<p>He knights the Bastard</p>
<p>Arise sir Richard, and Plantagenet.</p>
<p>BASTARD Brother by th’mother’s side, give me your hand:</p>
<p>My father gave me honour, yours gave land:</p>
<p>Now blessèd be the hour 115 by night or day,</p>
<p>When I was got, Sir Robert was away.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR The very spirit of Plantagenet:</p>
<p>I am thy grandam 116 , Richard: call me so.</p>
<p>BASTARD Madam, by chance, but not by truth 117 : what though 118
?</p>
<p>Something about 119 a little from the right 120 ,</p>
<p>In at the window 121 , or else o’er the hatch 122 :</p>
<p>Who dares not stir 123 by day must walk 124 by night,</p>
<p>And have 125 is have, however men do catch 126 :</p>
<p>Near or far off 127 , well won is still well shot 128 ,</p>
<p>And I am I, howe’er I was begot.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Go, Falconbridge, now hast thou thy desire:</p>
<p>A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.—</p>
<p>Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed 129</p>
<p>For France, for France, for it is more than need 130 .</p>
<p>BASTARD Brother, adieu 131 : good fortune come to thee,</p>
<p>For thou wast got i’th’way of honesty.</p>
<p>Exeunt all but Bastard</p>
<p>A foot 132 of honour better than I was,</p>
<p>But many a many 133 foot of land the worse.</p>
<p>Well, now can I make any Joan 134 a lady.</p>
<p>‘Good den 135 , Sir Richard’ — ‘God-a-mercy 136 , fellow’ —</p>
<p>And if his name be George, I’ll call him Peter;</p>
<p>For new-made honour doth forget men’s names:</p>
<p>’Tis 137 too respective 138 and too sociable</p>
<p>For your conversion 139 . Now your traveller,</p>
<p>He and his toothpick 140 at my worship’s mess 141 ,</p>
<p>And when my knightly stomach 142 is sufficed 143 ,</p>
<p>Why then I suck my teeth and catechize 144</p>
<p>My pickèd 145 man of countries 146 : ‘My dear sir,’</p>
<p>Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin,</p>
<p>‘I shall beseech you’; that is Question now,</p>
<p>And then comes Answer like an Absey book 147 :</p>
<p>‘O sir,’ says Answer, ’at your best command,</p>
<p>At your employment, at your service, sir.’</p>
<p>‘No, sir,’ says Question, ‘I, sweet sir, at yours.’</p>
<p>And so, ere Answer knows what Question would 148 ,</p>
<p>Saving 149 in dialogue of compliment 150 ,</p>
<p>And talking of the Alps and Apennines,</p>
<p>The Pyrenean and the river Po,</p>
<p>It draws toward supper 151 in conclusion so 152 .</p>
<p>But this is worshipful society,</p>
<p>And fits the mounting 153 spirit like myself;</p>
<p>For he is but a bastard to the time 154</p>
<p>That doth not smack 155 of observation 156 ,</p>
<p>And so am I 157 whether I smack or no:</p>
<p>And not alone in habit 158 and device 159 ,</p>
<p>Exterior form, outward accoutrement 160 ,</p>
<p>But from the inward motion 161 to deliver</p>
<p>Sweet, sweet, sweet poison 162 for the age’s tooth 163 ,</p>
<p>Which though I will not practise 164 to deceive,</p>
<p>Yet to avoid deceit I mean to learn 165 ;</p>
<p>For it shall strew 166 the footsteps of my rising 167 .</p>
<p>Enter Lady Falconbridge and James Gurney</p>
<p>But who comes in such haste in riding-robes 168 ?</p>
<p>What woman-post 169 is this? Hath she no husband</p>
<p>That will take pains to blow a horn 170 before her?</p>
<p>O me, ’tis my mother.— How now, good lady?</p>
<p>What brings you here to court so hastily?</p>
<p>LADY FALCONBRIDGE Where is that slave 171 thy brother? Where is
he</p>
<p>That holds in chase 172 mine honour up and down 173 ?</p>
<p>BASTARD My brother Robert, old Sir Robert’s son,</p>
<p>Colbrand the Giant 174 , that same mighty man,</p>
<p>Is it Sir Robert’s son that you seek so?</p>
<p>LADY FALCONBRIDGE Sir Robert’s son, ay, thou unreverend 175 boy,</p>
<p>Sir Robert’s son. Why scorn’st thou at Sir Robert?</p>
<p>He is Sir Robert’s son, and so art thou.</p>
<p>BASTARD James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave 176 a while?</p>
<p>GURNEY Good leave, good Philip.</p>
<p>BASTARD Philip Sparrow 177 , James,</p>
<p>There’s toys 178 abroad 179 : anon 180 I’ll tell thee more.</p>
<p>Exit James [Gurney ]</p>
<p>Madam, I was not old Sir Robert’s son:</p>
<p>Sir Robert might have eat 181 his part in 182 me</p>
<p>Upon Good Friday, and ne’er broke his fast 183 :</p>
<p>Sir Robert could do 184 well, marry 185 , to confess 186 :</p>
<p>Could get 187 me, Sir Robert could not do it;</p>
<p>We know his handiwork 188 : therefore, good mother,</p>
<p>To whom am I beholding 189 for these limbs?</p>
<p>Sir Robert never holp 190 to make this leg.</p>
<p>LADY FALCONBRIDGE Hast thou conspirèd with thy brother too,</p>
<p>That 191 for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?</p>
<p>What means this scorn, thou most untoward 192 knave 193 ?</p>
<p>BASTARD Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like 194 !</p>
<p>What! I am dubbed 195 , I have it on my shoulder:</p>
<p>But, mother, I am not Sir Robert’s son:</p>
<p>I have disclaimed Sir Robert and my land,</p>
<p>Legitimation 196 , name, and all is gone;</p>
<p>Then, good my mother, let me know my father:</p>
<p>Some proper 197 man, I hope: who was it, mother?</p>
<p>LADY FALCONBRIDGE Hast thou denied thyself a Falconbridge?</p>
<p>BASTARD As faithfully as I deny 198 the devil.</p>
<p>LADY FALCONBRIDGE King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:</p>
<p>By long and vehement suit 199 I was seduced</p>
<p>To make room for him in my husband’s bed:</p>
<p>Heaven 200 lay not my transgression to my charge 201 ,</p>
<p>That art the issue 202 of my dear 203 offence</p>
<p>Which was so strongly urged past my defence 204 .</p>
<p>BASTARD Now by this light, were I to get 205 again,</p>
<p>Madam, I would not wish a better father:</p>
<p>Some sins do bear their privilege 206 on earth,</p>
<p>And so doth yours: your fault was not your folly 207 :</p>
<p>Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose 208 ,</p>
<p>Subjected 209 tribute to commanding love,</p>
<p>Against whose fury and unmatchèd force</p>
<p>The aweless 210 lion could not wage the fight,</p>
<p>Nor keep his princely heart from Richard’s hand 211 :</p>
<p>He that perforce 212 robs lions of their hearts</p>
<p>May easily win a woman’s: ay, my mother,</p>
<p>With all my heart I thank thee for my father:</p>
<p>Who 213 lives and dares but say thou didst not well</p>
<p>When I was got, I’ll send his soul to hell.</p>
<p>Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin 214 ,</p>
<p>And they shall say, when Richard me begot,</p>
<p>If thou hadst said him nay 215 , it had been sin;</p>
<p>Who says it was 216 , he lies: I say ’twas not.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
