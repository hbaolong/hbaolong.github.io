16</h4>
<p>Enter the two Tribunes, Sicinius and Brutus</p>
<p>SICINIUS We hear not of him, neither need we fear him:</p>
<p>His remedies are tame 1510 : the present peace</p>
<p>And quietness of the people, which before</p>
<p>Were in wild hurry 1511 . Here do we make his friends</p>
<p>Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,</p>
<p>Though they themselves did suffer by’t, behold</p>
<p>Dissentious numbers pest’ring 1512 streets than see</p>
<p>Our tradesmen singing in their shops and going</p>
<p>About their functions 1513 friendly.</p>
<p>Enter Menenius</p>
<p>BRUTUS We stood to’t 1514 in good time. Is this Menenius?</p>
<p>SICINIUS ’Tis he, ’tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.—</p>
<p>Hail, sir.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Hail to you both.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Your Coriolanus is not much missed</p>
<p>But 1515 with his friends: the commonwealth doth stand,</p>
<p>And so would do, were 1516 he more angry at it.</p>
<p>MENENIUS All’s well, and might have been much better if</p>
<p>He could have temporized 1517 .</p>
<p>SICINIUS Where is he, hear you?</p>
<p>MENENIUS Nay, I hear nothing:</p>
<p>His mother and his wife hear nothing from him.</p>
<p>Enter three or four Citizens</p>
<p>ALL CITIZENS The gods preserve you both.</p>
<p>To the Tribunes</p>
<p>SICINIUS Good e’en 1518 , our neighbours.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Good e’en to you all, good e’en to you all.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN Ourselves, our wives and children, on our knees,</p>
<p>Are bound to pray for you both.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Live and thrive.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Farewell, kind neighbours.</p>
<p>We wished Coriolanus had loved you as we did.</p>
<p>ALL CITIZENS Now the gods keep you!</p>
<p>SICINIUS and BRUTUS Farewell, farewell.</p>
<p>Exeunt Citizens</p>
<p>SICINIUS This is a happier and more comely 1519 time</p>
<p>Than when these fellows ran about the streets,</p>
<p>Crying confusion.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Caius Martius was</p>
<p>A worthy officer i’th’war, but insolent,</p>
<p>O’ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,</p>
<p>Self-loving—</p>
<p>SICINIUS And affecting 1520 one sole throne, without assistance 1521
.</p>
<p>MENENIUS I think not so.</p>
<p>SICINIUS We should by this 1522 , to all our lamentation,</p>
<p>If he had gone forth consul, found it so.</p>
<p>BRUTUS The gods have well prevented it, and Rome</p>
<p>Sits safe and still without him.</p>
<p>Enter an Aedile</p>
<p>AEDILE Worthy tribunes,</p>
<p>There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,</p>
<p>Reports the Volsces with two several powers 1523</p>
<p>Are entered in the Roman territories,</p>
<p>And with the deepest malice of the war</p>
<p>Destroy what lies before ’em.</p>
<p>MENENIUS ’Tis Aufidius,</p>
<p>Who, hearing of our Martius’ banishment,</p>
<p>Thrusts forth his horns 1524 again into the world</p>
<p>Which were inshelled 1525 when Martius stood 1526 for Rome,</p>
<p>And durst not once peep out.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Come, what 1527 talk you of Martius?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Go see this rumourer whipped.— It cannot be</p>
<p>To the Aedile</p>
<p>The Volsces dare break with us 1528 .</p>
<p>MENENIUS Cannot be?</p>
<p>We have record that very well it can,</p>
<p>And three examples of the like hath been</p>
<p>Within my age 1529 . But reason with 1530 the fellow,</p>
<p>Before you punish him, where he heard this,</p>
<p>Lest you shall chance to whip your information 1531</p>
<p>And beat the messenger who bids beware</p>
<p>Of what is to be dreaded.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Tell not me: I know this cannot be.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Not possible.</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER The nobles in great earnestness are going</p>
<p>All to the senate house: some news is come</p>
<p>That turns 1532 their countenances.</p>
<p>SICINIUS ’Tis this slave:—</p>
<p>Go whip him, fore the people’s eyes.— His raising 1533 ,</p>
<p>To the Aedile</p>
<p>Nothing but his report.</p>
<p>MESSENGER Yes, worthy sir,</p>
<p>The slave’s report is seconded 1534 and more,</p>
<p>More fearful, is delivered.</p>
<p>SICINIUS What more fearful?</p>
<p>MESSENGER It is spoke freely out of many mouths —</p>
<p>How probable I do not know — that Martius,</p>
<p>Joined with Aufidius, leads a power gainst Rome,</p>
<p>And vows revenge as spacious as between 1535</p>
<p>The young’st and oldest thing.</p>
<p>SICINIUS This is most likely!</p>
<p>BRUTUS Raised 1536 only, that the weaker sort may wish</p>
<p>Good Martius home again.</p>
<p>SICINIUS The very trick on’t 1537 .</p>
<p>MENENIUS This is unlikely:</p>
<p>He and Aufidius can no more atone 1538</p>
<p>Than violent’st contrariety 1539 .</p>
<p>Enter [another ] Messenger</p>
<p>SECOND MESSENGER You are sent for to the senate:</p>
<p>A fearful army, led by Caius Martius,</p>
<p>Associated with Aufidius, rages</p>
<p>Upon our territories, and have already</p>
<p>O’erborne 1540 their way, consumed with fire, and took 1541</p>
<p>What lay before them.</p>
<p>Enter Cominius</p>
<p>COMINIUS O, you have made good work!</p>
<p>MENENIUS What news? What news?</p>
<p>COMINIUS You have holp 1542 to ravish 1543 your own daughters and</p>
<p>To melt the city leads 1544 upon your pates 1545 ,</p>
<p>To see your wives dishonoured to your noses 1546 .</p>
<p>MENENIUS What’s the news? What’s the news?</p>
<p>COMINIUS Your temples burnèd in their cement 1547 , and</p>
<p>Your franchises 1548 , whereon you stood, confined</p>
<p>Into an auger’s bore 1549 .</p>
<p>MENENIUS Pray now, your news?</p>
<p>You have made fair work, I fear me.—</p>
<p>To the Tribunes</p>
<p>Pray, your news.—</p>
<p>To Cominius</p>
<p>If Martius should be joined with Volscians.</p>
<p>COMINIUS If? He is their god: he leads them like a thing</p>
<p>Made by some other deity than nature,</p>
<p>That shapes man better, and they follow him</p>
<p>Against us brats 1550 , with no less confidence</p>
<p>Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,</p>
<p>Or butchers killing flies.</p>
<p>MENENIUS You have made good work,</p>
<p>To the Tribunes</p>
<p>You and your apron-men 1551 : you that stood so much</p>
<p>Upon the voice of occupation 1552 and</p>
<p>The breath of garlic-eaters 1553 !</p>
<p>COMINIUS He’ll shake your Rome about your ears.</p>
<p>To the Tribunes</p>
<p>MENENIUS As Hercules did shake down mellow fruit 1554 .</p>
<p>You have made fair work.</p>
<p>BRUTUS But is this true, sir?</p>
<p>COMINIUS Ay, and you’ll look pale</p>
<p>Before you find it other 1555 . All the regions</p>
<p>Do smilingly 1556 revolt, and who 1557 resists</p>
<p>Are mocked for valiant ignorance,</p>
<p>And perish constant 1558 fools. Who is’t can blame him?</p>
<p>Your enemies and his find something 1559 in him.</p>
<p>MENENIUS We are all undone 1560 , unless</p>
<p>The noble man have mercy.</p>
<p>COMINIUS Who shall ask it?</p>
<p>The tribunes cannot do’t for 1561 shame: the people</p>
<p>Deserve such pity of him as the wolf</p>
<p>Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they</p>
<p>Should say ‘Be good to Rome’, they charged 1562 him even</p>
<p>As those should do that had deserved his hate,</p>
<p>And therein showed 1563 like enemies.</p>
<p>MENENIUS ’Tis true: if he were putting to my house the brand 1564</p>
<p>That should consume it, I have not the face</p>
<p>To say ‘Beseech you, cease.’— You have made fair hands 1565 ,</p>
<p>To the Tribunes</p>
<p>You and your crafts 1566 : you have crafted 1567 fair!</p>
<p>COMINIUS You have brought</p>
<p>A trembling upon Rome, such as was never</p>
<p>S’incapable of help 1568 .</p>
<p>SICINIUS and BRUTUS Say not we brought it.</p>
<p>MENENIUS How? Was’t we? We loved him,</p>
<p>But, like beasts and cowardly nobles,</p>
<p>Gave way unto your clusters 1569 , who did hoot</p>
<p>Him out o’th’city.</p>
<p>COMINIUS But I fear</p>
<p>They’ll roar 1570 him in again. Tullus Aufidius,</p>
<p>The second name 1571 of men, obeys his points 1572</p>
<p>As if he were his officer: desperation</p>
<p>Is all the policy, strength and defence</p>
<p>That Rome can make against them.</p>
<p>Enter a troop of Citizens</p>
<p>MENENIUS Here come the clusters.</p>
<p>And is Aufidius with him? You are they</p>
<p>That made the air unwholesome when you cast</p>
<p>Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at</p>
<p>Coriolanus’ exile. Now he’s coming,</p>
<p>And not a hair upon a soldier’s head</p>
<p>Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs 1573</p>
<p>As you threw caps up will he tumble down,</p>
<p>And pay you for your voices. ’Tis no matter:</p>
<p>If he could burn us all into one coal 1574 ,</p>
<p>We have deserved it.</p>
<p>ALL CITIZENS Faith, we hear fearful news.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN For mine own part,</p>
<p>When I said ‘Banish him’ I said ’twas pity.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN And so did I.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN And so did I: and to say the truth, so did very many of
us: that we did, we did for the best, and though we willingly consented
to his banishment, yet it was against our will.</p>
<p>COMINIUS You’re goodly things, you voices.</p>
<p>MENENIUS You have made good work,</p>
<p>You and your cry 1575 . Shall’s 1576 to the Capitol?</p>
<p>COMINIUS O, ay, what else?</p>
<p>Exeunt [Cominius and Menenius ]</p>
<p>SICINIUS Go, masters, get you home: be not dismayed:</p>
<p>These are a side 1577 that would be glad to have</p>
<p>This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,</p>
<p>And show no sign of fear.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let’s home. I
ever said we were i’th’wrong when we banished him.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN So did we all. But, come, let’s home.</p>
<p>Exeunt Citizens</p>
<p>BRUTUS I do not like this news.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Nor I.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Let’s to the Capitol. Would half my wealth</p>
<p>Would buy this for a lie 1578 .</p>
<p>SICINIUS Pray, let’s go.</p>
<p>Exeunt Tribunes</p>
