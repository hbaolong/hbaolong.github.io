<h4 id="scene-1-361-running-scene-5">Scene 1 361 ／running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter Gaunt, sick 362 , with York [and Attendants ]</p>
<p>GAUNT Will the king come, that I may breathe my last</p>
<p>In wholesome counsel to his unstaid 363 youth?</p>
<p>YORK Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath,</p>
<p>For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.</p>
<p>GAUNT O, but they say the tongues of dying men</p>
<p>Enforce attention like deep harmony.</p>
<p>Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,</p>
<p>For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.</p>
<p>He that no more must say is listened 364 more</p>
<p>Than they whom youth and ease have taught to gloze 365 .</p>
<p>More are men’s ends marked 366 than their lives before.</p>
<p>The setting sun and music is the close 367 ,</p>
<p>As the last 368 taste of sweets is sweetest last,</p>
<p>Writ in remembrance more than things long past.</p>
<p>Though Richard my life’s counsel would not hear,</p>
<p>My death’s sad 369 tale may yet undeaf his ear.</p>
<p>YORK No, it is stopped with other flatt’ring sounds,</p>
<p>As praises, of his state 370 : then there are found</p>
<p>Lascivious metres 371 , to whose venom 372 sound</p>
<p>The open ear of youth doth always listen,</p>
<p>Report of fashions in proud 373 Italy,</p>
<p>Whose manners still our tardy apish 374 nation</p>
<p>Limps after in base imitation.</p>
<p>Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity 375 ——</p>
<p>So 376 it be new, there’s no respect 377 how vile ——</p>
<p>That is not quickly buzzed 378 into his ears?</p>
<p>That 379 all too late comes counsel to be heard,</p>
<p>Where will doth mutiny with wit’s regard 380 .</p>
<p>Direct not him whose way himself will choose.</p>
<p>’Tis breath thou lack’st, and that breath wilt thou lose.</p>
<p>GAUNT Methinks I am a prophet new inspired 381</p>
<p>And thus expiring 382 do foretell of him.</p>
<p>His rash fierce blaze of riot 383 cannot last,</p>
<p>For violent fires soon burn out themselves.</p>
<p>Small 384 showers last long, but sudden storms are short.</p>
<p>He tires betimes 385 that spurs too fast betimes.</p>
<p>With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder.</p>
<p>Light vanity 386 , insatiate cormorant 387 ,</p>
<p>Consuming means 388 soon preys upon itself.</p>
<p>This royal throne of kings, this sceptred 389 isle,</p>
<p>This earth of majesty 390 , this seat of Mars 391 ,</p>
<p>This other Eden, demi-paradise,</p>
<p>This fortress built by nature for herself</p>
<p>Against infection and the hand of war,</p>
<p>This happy breed 392 of men, this little world,</p>
<p>This precious stone set in the silver sea,</p>
<p>Which serves it in the office 393 of a wall,</p>
<p>Or as a moat defensive to a house,</p>
<p>Against the envy of less happier lands,</p>
<p>This blessèd plot 394 , this earth, this realm, this England,</p>
<p>This nurse, this teeming 395 womb of royal kings,</p>
<p>Feared by their breed 396 and famous for their birth,</p>
<p>Renownèd for their deeds as far from home,</p>
<p>For Christian service and true chivalry,</p>
<p>As is the sepulchre 397 in stubborn Jewry 398</p>
<p>Of the world’s ransom, blessèd Mary’s son 399 :</p>
<p>This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,</p>
<p>Dear for her reputation through the world,</p>
<p>Is now leased out —— I die pronouncing it ——</p>
<p>Like to a tenement 400 or pelting 401 farm.</p>
<p>England, bound in 402 with the triumphant sea,</p>
<p>Whose rocky shore beats back the envious 403 siege</p>
<p>Of watery Neptune 404 , is now bound 405 in with shame,</p>
<p>With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds 406 .</p>
<p>That England, that was wont 407 to conquer others,</p>
<p>Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.</p>
<p>Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,</p>
<p>How happy then were my ensuing death!</p>
<p>Enter King, Queen, Aumerle, Bushy, Green, Bagot, Ross and
Willoughby</p>
<p>YORK The king is come. Deal mildly with his youth,</p>
<p>For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.</p>
<p>QUEEN How fares our noble uncle Lancaster?</p>
<p>KING RICHARD What comfort, man? How is’t with agèd Gaunt?</p>
<p>GAUNT O, how that name befits my composition 408 !</p>
<p>Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old.</p>
<p>Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast,</p>
<p>And who abstains from meat 409 that is not gaunt?</p>
<p>For sleeping England long time have I watched 410 .</p>
<p>Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt.</p>
<p>The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,</p>
<p>Is my strict fast —— I mean, my children’s looks,</p>
<p>And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt.</p>
<p>Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,</p>
<p>Whose hollow womb inherits 411 nought but bones.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Can sick men play so nicely 412 with their names?</p>
<p>GAUNT No, misery makes sport to mock 413 itself.</p>
<p>Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me 414 ,</p>
<p>I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Should dying men flatter those that live?</p>
<p>GAUNT No, no, men living flatter those that die.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Thou, now a-dying, say’st thou flatter’st me.</p>
<p>GAUNT O no, thou diest, though I the sicker be.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD I am in health, I breathe, I see thee ill 415 .</p>
<p>GAUNT Now he that made me knows I see thee ill:</p>
<p>Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.</p>
<p>Thy death-bed is no lesser than the land</p>
<p>Wherein thou liest in reputation sick.</p>
<p>And thou, too careless patient as thou art,</p>
<p>Commit’st thy anointed body to the cure</p>
<p>Of those physicians that first wounded thee.</p>
<p>A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,</p>
<p>Whose compass 416 is no bigger than thy head.</p>
<p>And yet, encagèd in so small a verge 417 ,</p>
<p>The waste 418 is no whit lesser than thy land.</p>
<p>O, had thy grandsire 419 with a prophet’s eye</p>
<p>Seen how his son’s son should destroy his sons 420 ,</p>
<p>From forth 421 thy reach he would have laid thy shame,</p>
<p>Deposing 422 thee before thou wert possessed 423 ,</p>
<p>Which art possessed now to depose thyself.</p>
<p>Why, cousin 424 , were thou regent 425 of the world,</p>
<p>It were a shame to let his land 426 by lease.</p>
<p>But for thy world enjoying but this land,</p>
<p>Is it not more than shame to shame it so?</p>
<p>Landlord of England art thou and not king.</p>
<p>Thy state of law 427 is bondslave to the law, and——</p>
<p>KING RICHARD And thou, a lunatic lean-witted fool,</p>
<p>Presuming 428 on an ague 429 ’s privilege,</p>
<p>Dar’st with thy frozen 430 admonition</p>
<p>Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood</p>
<p>With fury from his native residence?</p>
<p>Now, by my seat 431 ’s right royal majesty,</p>
<p>Wert thou not brother to great Edward’s son,</p>
<p>This tongue that runs so roundly 432 in thy head</p>
<p>Should run thy head from thy unreverent 433 shoulders.</p>
<p>GAUNT O, spare me not, my brother’s —— Edward’s —— son,</p>
<p>For that 434 I was his father Edward’s son.</p>
<p>That blood already, like the pelican 435 ,</p>
<p>Thou hast tapped out 436 and drunkenly caroused 437 .</p>
<p>My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul ——</p>
<p>Whom fair 438 befall in heaven ’mongst happy souls! ——</p>
<p>May be a precedent and witness good</p>
<p>That thou respect’st not spilling Edward’s blood.</p>
<p>Join with the present sickness that I have,</p>
<p>And thy unkindness 439 be like crookèd age,</p>
<p>To crop at once a too long withered flower.</p>
<p>Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee:</p>
<p>These words hereafter thy tormentors be!</p>
<p>Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:</p>
<p>Love they to live that love and honour have.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Carried off by Attendants</p>
<p>KING RICHARD And let them die that age and sullens 440 have,</p>
<p>For both hast thou, and both become 441 the grave.</p>
<p>YORK I do beseech your majesty, impute his words</p>
<p>To wayward sickliness and age in him.</p>
<p>He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear</p>
<p>As Harry 442 Duke of Hereford, were he here.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Right, you say true. As Hereford’s love, so his;</p>
<p>As theirs, so mine, and all be as it is.</p>
<p>Enter Northumberland</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD What says he?</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Nay, nothing. All is said.</p>
<p>His tongue is now a stringless instrument.</p>
<p>Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent 443 .</p>
<p>YORK Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!</p>
<p>Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he.</p>
<p>His time is spent, our pilgrimage 444 must be.</p>
<p>So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:</p>
<p>We must supplant 445 those rough rug-headed 446 kerns 447 ,</p>
<p>Which live like venom where no venom else</p>
<p>But only they have privilege to live.</p>
<p>And for these great affairs do ask some charge 448 ,</p>
<p>Towards our assistance we do seize 449 to us</p>
<p>The plate 450 , coin, revenues and movables 451 ,</p>
<p>Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possessed.</p>
<p>YORK How long shall I be patient? O, how long</p>
<p>Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?</p>
<p>Not Gloucester’s death, nor Hereford’s banishment,</p>
<p>Nor Gaunt’s rebukes 452 , nor England’s private wrongs 453 ,</p>
<p>Nor the prevention of poor Bullingbrook</p>
<p>About his marriage 454 , nor my own disgrace</p>
<p>Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,</p>
<p>Or bend one wrinkle 455 on my sovereign’s face.</p>
<p>I am the last of noble Edward’s sons,</p>
<p>Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first.</p>
<p>In war was never lion raged more fierce,</p>
<p>In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,</p>
<p>Than was that young and princely gentleman.</p>
<p>His face thou hast, for even so looked he,</p>
<p>Accomplished with the number of thy hours 456 .</p>
<p>But when he frowned, it was against the French</p>
<p>And not against his friends. His noble hand</p>
<p>Did win what he did spend and spent not that</p>
<p>Which his triumphant father’s hand had won.</p>
<p>His hands were guilty of no kindred’s blood,</p>
<p>But bloody with the enemies of his kin.</p>
<p>O Richard, York is too far gone with grief,</p>
<p>Or else he never would compare between.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Why, uncle, what’s the matter?</p>
<p>YORK O my liege,</p>
<p>Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased</p>
<p>Not to be pardoned, am content withal 457 .</p>
<p>Seek you to seize 458 and grip into your hands</p>
<p>The royalties 459 and rights of banished Hereford?</p>
<p>Is not Gaunt dead? And doth not Hereford live?</p>
<p>Was not Gaunt just? And is not Harry true 460 ?</p>
<p>Did not the one deserve to have an heir?</p>
<p>Is not his heir a well-deserving son?</p>
<p>Take Hereford’s rights away, and take from time</p>
<p>His 461 charters and his customary rights 462 :</p>
<p>Let not tomorrow then ensue 463 today.</p>
<p>Be not thyself. For how art thou a king</p>
<p>But by fair sequence and succession?</p>
<p>Now, afore God —— God forbid I say true! ——</p>
<p>If you do wrongfully seize Hereford’s right,</p>
<p>Call in his letters patents 464 that he hath</p>
<p>By his attorneys-general to sue</p>
<p>His livery 465 , and deny his offered homage 466 ,</p>
<p>You pluck 467 a thousand dangers on your head,</p>
<p>You lose a thousand well-disposèd hearts</p>
<p>And prick 468 my tender patience to those thoughts</p>
<p>Which honour and allegiance cannot think.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Think what you will, we seize into our hands</p>
<p>His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.</p>
<p>YORK I’ll not be by 469 the while. My liege, farewell:</p>
<p>What will ensue hereof, there’s none can tell.</p>
<p>But by bad courses 470 may be understood</p>
<p>That their events 471 can never fall out good.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight.</p>
<p>Bid him repair 472 to us to Ely House</p>
<p>To see 473 this business.—— Tomorrow next 474</p>
<p>We will for Ireland, and ’tis time, I trow 475 .</p>
<p>And we create, in absence of ourself,</p>
<p>Our uncle York Lord Governor of England,</p>
<p>For he is just and always loved us well.——</p>
<p>Come on, our queen. Tomorrow must we part.</p>
<p>Be merry, for our time of stay is short.</p>
<p>Flourish .</p>
<p>[Exeunt all ] except Northumberland, Willoughby and Ross</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.</p>
<p>ROSS And living too, for now his son is duke.</p>
<p>WILLOUGHBY Barely in title, not in revenue.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Richly in both, if justice had her right.</p>
<p>ROSS My heart is great 476 , but it must break with silence 477 ,</p>
<p>Ere’t be disburdened with a liberal 478 tongue.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Nay, speak thy mind, and let him ne’er speak more</p>
<p>That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!</p>
<p>WILLOUGHBY Tends that thou wouldst speak to 479 th’Duke of
Hereford?</p>
<p>If it be so, out with it boldly, man.</p>
<p>Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.</p>
<p>ROSS No good at all that I can do for him,</p>
<p>Unless you call it good to pity him,</p>
<p>Bereft 480 and gelded 481 of his patrimony.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Now, afore heaven, ’tis shame such wrongs are
borne</p>
<p>In him, a royal prince, and many more</p>
<p>Of noble blood in this declining land.</p>
<p>The king is not himself, but basely led</p>
<p>By flatterers. And what they will inform,</p>
<p>Merely in hate, gainst any of us all,</p>
<p>That will the king severely prosecute 482</p>
<p>Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.</p>
<p>ROSS The commons hath he piled 483 with grievous taxes,</p>
<p>And quite lost their hearts. The nobles hath he fined</p>
<p>For ancient 484 quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.</p>
<p>WILLOUGHBY And daily new exactions 485 are devised,</p>
<p>As blanks 486 , benevolences 487 , and I wot 488 not what.</p>
<p>But what, o’God’s name, doth become of this 489 ?</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Wars hath not wasted it, for warred he hath not,</p>
<p>But basely yielded upon compromise 490</p>
<p>That which his ancestors achieved with blows.</p>
<p>More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.</p>
<p>ROSS The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm 491 .</p>
<p>WILLOUGHBY The king’s grown bankrupt, like a broken 492 man.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.</p>
<p>ROSS He hath not money for these Irish wars,</p>
<p>His burdenous taxations notwithstanding,</p>
<p>But by the robbing of the banished duke.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND His noble kinsman. Most degenerate king!</p>
<p>But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,</p>
<p>Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm.</p>
<p>We see the wind sit sore 493 upon our sails,</p>
<p>And yet we strike 494 not, but securely 495 perish.</p>
<p>ROSS We see the very wreck that we must suffer,</p>
<p>And unavoided is the danger now,</p>
<p>For suffering 496 so the causes of our wreck.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Not so: even through the hollow eyes of death</p>
<p>I spy life peering, but I dare not say</p>
<p>How near the tidings 497 of our comfort is.</p>
<p>WILLOUGHBY Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.</p>
<p>ROSS Be confident to speak, Northumberland.</p>
<p>We three are but thyself, and speaking so,</p>
<p>Thy words are but as thoughts: therefore be bold.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay</p>
<p>In Brittany, received intelligence</p>
<p>That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,</p>
<p>That late broke 498 from the Duke of Exeter 499 ,</p>
<p>His 500 brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Rainston,</p>
<p>Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,</p>
<p>All these well furnished 501 by the Duke of Brittany</p>
<p>With eight tall 502 ships, three thousand men of war,</p>
<p>Are making hither with all due expedience 503</p>
<p>And shortly mean to touch our northern shore.</p>
<p>Perhaps they had ere this 504 , but that they stay 505</p>
<p>The first departing of the king for Ireland.</p>
<p>If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,</p>
<p>Imp out 506 our drooping country’s broken wing,</p>
<p>Redeem from broking pawn 507 the blemished crown,</p>
<p>Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre’s gilt 508</p>
<p>And make high majesty look like itself,</p>
<p>Away with me in post 509 to Ravenspurgh 510 .</p>
<p>But if you faint 511 , as fearing to do so,</p>
<p>Stay and be secret, and myself will go.</p>
<p>ROSS To horse 512 , to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear.</p>
<p>WILLOUGHBY Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
