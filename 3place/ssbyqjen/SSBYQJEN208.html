<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-9-continues">Scene 1 ／ running scene 9
continues</h4>
<p>Enter Rosalind, and Celia and Jaques</p>
<p>JAQUES I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
thee.</p>
<p>ROSALIND They say you are a melancholy fellow.</p>
<p>JAQUES I am so. I do love it better than laughing.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
fellows, and betray 923 themselves to every modern censure 924 worse
than drunkards.</p>
<p>JAQUES Why, ’tis good to be sad 925 and say nothing.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Why then, ’tis good to be a post 926 .</p>
<p>JAQUES I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which is emulation
927 , nor the musician’s, which is fantastical 928 , nor the courtier’s,
which is proud, nor the soldier’s, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer’s,
which is politic 929 , nor the lady’s, which is nice 930 , nor the
lover’s, which is all these: but it is a melancholy of mine own,
compounded of many simples 931 , extracted from many objects, and indeed
the sundry 932 contemplation of my travels, in which my often 933
rumination wraps me in a most humorous 934 sadness.</p>
<p>ROSALIND A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad: I
fear you have sold your own lands to see other men’s; then to have seen
much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.</p>
<p>JAQUES Yes, I have gained my experience.</p>
<p>Enter Orlando</p>
<p>ROSALIND And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have a fool
to make me merry than experience to make me sad, and to travel 935 for
it too.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!</p>
<p>JAQUES Nay, then, God buy you, an 936 you talk in blank verse.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>ROSALIND Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp 937 and wear
strange suits 938 , disable 939 all the benefits of your own country, be
out of love with your nativity 940 , and almost chide God for making you
that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have swam 941 in a
gondola. Why, how now, Orlando, where have you been all this while? You
a lover? An you serve me such another trick, never come in my sight
more.</p>
<p>ORLANDO My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Break an hour’s promise in love? He that will divide a
minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part
of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid
hath clapped him o’th’shoulder 942 , but I’ll warrant him heart-whole
943 .</p>
<p>ORLANDO Pardon me, dear Rosalind.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had as
lief be wooed of a snail.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Of a snail?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Ay, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he carries his
house on his head; a better jointure 944 , I think, than you make a
woman. Besides, he brings his destiny with him.</p>
<p>ORLANDO What’s that?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Why, horns 945 , which such as you are fain 946 to be
beholding 947 to your wives for: but he comes armed in his fortune 948
and prevents the slander 949 of his wife.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Virtue is no horn-maker, and my Rosalind is virtuous.</p>
<p>ROSALIND And I am your Rosalind.</p>
<p>CELIA It pleases him to call you so, but he hath a Rosalind of a
better leer 950 than you.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humour 951
and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I were your
very 952 very Rosalind?</p>
<p>ORLANDO I would kiss before I spoke.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were
gravelled 953 for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very
good orators, when they are out 954 , they will spit. And for lovers
lacking — God warn 955 us! — matter, the cleanliest shift 956 is to
kiss.</p>
<p>ORLANDO How if the kiss be denied?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
matter.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Who could be out 957 , being before his beloved mistress?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or I should
think my honesty 958 ranker 959 than my wit.</p>
<p>ORLANDO What, of my suit 960 ?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I
your Rosalind?</p>
<p>ORLANDO I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking of
her.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Then, in mine own person, I die.</p>
<p>ROSALIND No, faith, die by attorney 961 . The poor world is almost
six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died
in his own person, videlicet 962 , in a love-cause. Troilus 963 had his
brains dashed out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die
964 before, and he is one of the patterns 965 of love. Leander 966 , he
would have lived many a fair year though 967 Hero had turned nun, if it
had not been for a hot midsummer night, for, good youth, he went but
forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being taken with the cramp was
drowned. And the foolish chroniclers of that age found it 968 was ‘Hero
of Sestos’. But these are all lies: men have died from time to time and
worms have eaten them, but not for love.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I would not have my right 969 Rosalind of this mind, for I
protest her frown might kill me.</p>
<p>ROSALIND By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I will
be your Rosalind in a more coming-on 970 disposition. And ask me what
you will, I will grant it.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Then love me, Rosalind.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays 971 and all.</p>
<p>ORLANDO And wilt thou have me?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Ay, and twenty 972 such.</p>
<p>ORLANDO What sayest thou?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Are you not good?</p>
<p>ORLANDO I hope so.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
sister, you shall be the priest and marry us. Give me your hand,
Orlando. What do you say, sister?</p>
<p>ORLANDO Pray thee marry us.</p>
<p>CELIA I cannot say the words.</p>
<p>ROSALIND You must begin, ‘Will you, Orlando —’</p>
<p>CELIA Go to 973 . Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?</p>
<p>ORLANDO I will.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Ay, but when?</p>
<p>ORLANDO Why now, as fast 974 as she can marry us.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Then you must say ‘I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.’</p>
<p>ORLANDO I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.</p>
<p>ROSALIND I might ask you for your commission 975 , but I do take
thee, Orlando, for my husband. There’s a girl goes before the priest 976
, and certainly a woman’s thought runs before her actions.</p>
<p>ORLANDO So do all thoughts: they are winged.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Now tell me how long you would have her after you have
possessed 977 her.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Forever and a day.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Say ‘a day’, without the ‘ever’. No, no, Orlando. Men are
April when they woo, December when they wed. Maids are May when they are
maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon 978 over his hen, more clamorous than
a parrot against 979 rain, more new-fangled 980 than an ape, more giddy
in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the
fountain 981 , and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry. I
will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou art inclined to sleep.</p>
<p>ORLANDO But will my Rosalind do so?</p>
<p>ROSALIND By my life, she will do as I do.</p>
<p>ORLANDO O, but she is wise.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the wiser,
the waywarder 982 . Make 983 the doors upon a woman’s wit 984 and it
will out at the casement 985 . Shut that and ’twill out at the key-hole.
Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.</p>
<p>ORLANDO A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say ‘Wit,
whither wilt?’ 986</p>
<p>ROSALIND Nay, you might keep that check 987 for it till you met your
wife’s wit going to your neighbour’s bed.</p>
<p>ORLANDO And what wit could wit have to excuse that?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never
take 988 her without her answer, unless you take her without her tongue.
O, that woman that cannot make her fault 989 her husband’s occasion 990
, let her never nurse 991 her child herself, for she will breed it like
a fool.</p>
<p>ORLANDO For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I must attend the duke at dinner. By two o’clock I will be
with thee again.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would prove:
my friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering
tongue of yours won me. ’Tis but one cast away 992 , and so, come,
death! Two o’clock is your hour?</p>
<p>ORLANDO Ay, sweet Rosalind.</p>
<p>ROSALIND By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by
all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your
promise or come one minute behind your hour 993 , I will think you the
most pathetical 994 break-promise and the most hollow lover and the most
unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross
995 band of the unfaithful: therefore beware my censure 996 and keep
your promise.</p>
<p>ORLANDO With no less religion 997 than if thou wert indeed my
Rosalind: so adieu.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Well, time is the old justice that examines all such
offenders, and let time try 998 . Adieu.</p>
<p>Exit [Orlando ]</p>
<p>CELIA You have simply misused 999 our sex in your love-prate 1000 :
we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head, and show the
world what the bird hath done to her own nest 1001 .</p>
<p>ROSALIND O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know
how many fathom 1002 deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded 1003 :
my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.</p>
<p>CELIA Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour affection in,
it runs out.</p>
<p>ROSALIND No, that same wicked bastard of Venus 1004 that was begot
1005 of thought 1006 , conceived of spleen 1007 and born of madness,
that blind 1008 rascally boy that abuses 1009 everyone’s eyes because
his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love. I’ll tell thee,
Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando: I’ll go find a shadow
1010 and sigh till he come.</p>
<p>CELIA And I’ll sleep.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
