<h4 id="scene-4-629-running-scene-6">Scene 4 629 / running scene 6</h4>
<p>Enter Posthumus and Philario</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure</p>
<p>To win 630 the king as I am bold 631 her honour</p>
<p>Will remain hers.</p>
<p>PHILARIO What means 632 do you make to him?</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Not any: but abide the change of time,</p>
<p>Quake in the present winter’s state 633 and wish</p>
<p>That warmer days would come: in these seared 634 hopes</p>
<p>I barely gratify 635 your love; they failing 636 ,</p>
<p>I must die much your debtor.</p>
<p>PHILARIO Your very goodness and your company</p>
<p>O’erpays all I can do. By this 637 your king</p>
<p>Hath heard of 638 great Augustus: Caius Lucius</p>
<p>Will do’s commission throughly 639 . And I think</p>
<p>He’ll 640 grant the tribute: send th’arrearages 641 ,</p>
<p>Or look upon 642 our Romans, whose remembrance 643</p>
<p>Is yet 644 fresh in their grief.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS I do believe —</p>
<p>Statist 645 though I am none, nor like to be —</p>
<p>That this will prove 646 a war; and you shall hear</p>
<p>The legions now in Gallia sooner landed</p>
<p>In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings</p>
<p>Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen</p>
<p>Are men more ordered 647 than when Julius Caesar</p>
<p>Smiled at their lack of skill, but found their courage</p>
<p>Worthy his frowning 648 at. Their discipline,</p>
<p>Now mingled with their courages, will make known</p>
<p>To their approvers 649 they are people such</p>
<p>That mend upon the world 650 .</p>
<p>Enter Iachimo</p>
<p>PHILARIO See Iachimo.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS The swiftest harts 651 have posted 652 you by land,</p>
<p>And winds of all the corners 653 kissed your sails,</p>
<p>To make your vessel nimble.</p>
<p>PHILARIO Welcome, sir.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS I hope the briefness of your answer 654 made 655</p>
<p>The speediness of your return.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Your lady</p>
<p>Is one of the fairest that I have looked upon—</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS And therewithal 656 the best, or let her beauty</p>
<p>Look through a casement 657 to allure false hearts,</p>
<p>And be false with them.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Here are letters for you.</p>
<p>Gives letters</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Their tenor 658 good, I trust.</p>
<p>IACHIMO ’Tis very like 659 .</p>
<p>PHILARIO Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court</p>
<p>When you were there?</p>
<p>IACHIMO He was expected then,</p>
<p>But not approached 660 .</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS All is well yet.</p>
<p>Sparkles this stone as it was wont 661 , or is’t not</p>
<p>Shows the ring</p>
<p>Too dull for your good wearing?</p>
<p>IACHIMO If I had lost it,</p>
<p>I should have lost the worth of it in gold.</p>
<p>I’ll make a journey twice as far t’enjoy</p>
<p>A second night of such sweet shortness which</p>
<p>Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS The stone’s too hard to come by.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Not a whit 662 ,</p>
<p>Your lady being so easy.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Make not, sir,</p>
<p>Your loss your sport 663 : I hope you know that we</p>
<p>Must not continue friends.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Good sir, we must</p>
<p>If you keep covenant 664 . Had I not brought</p>
<p>The knowledge 665 of your mistress home, I grant</p>
<p>We were to question further 666 , but I now</p>
<p>Profess myself the winner of her honour,</p>
<p>Together with your ring, and not the wronger</p>
<p>Of her or you, having proceeded but</p>
<p>By both your wills 667 .</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS If you can make’t apparent</p>
<p>That you have tasted 668 her in bed, my hand 669</p>
<p>And ring is yours. If not, the foul opinion</p>
<p>You had of her pure honour gains or loses</p>
<p>Your sword or mine 670 , or masterless leaves both</p>
<p>To who shall find them 671 .</p>
<p>IACHIMO Sir, my circumstances 672 ,</p>
<p>Being so near the truth, as I will make them,</p>
<p>Must first induce you to believe: whose strength</p>
<p>I will confirm with oath, which I doubt not</p>
<p>You’ll give me leave to spare 673 , when you shall find</p>
<p>You need it not.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Proceed.</p>
<p>IACHIMO First, her bedchamber —</p>
<p>Where I confess I slept not, but profess</p>
<p>Had that was well worth watching 674 — it was hanged</p>
<p>With tapestry of silk and silver 675 , the story</p>
<p>Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman</p>
<p>And Cydnus 676 swelled above the banks, or 677 for</p>
<p>The press 678 of boats, or pride 679 . A piece of work</p>
<p>So bravely 680 done, so rich, that it did strive</p>
<p>In workmanship and value, which I wondered</p>
<p>Could be so rarely 681 and exactly wrought,</p>
<p>Since the true life on’t was—</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS This is true:</p>
<p>And this you might have heard of here, by me,</p>
<p>Or by some other.</p>
<p>IACHIMO More particulars</p>
<p>Must justify my knowledge.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS So they must,</p>
<p>Or do your honour injury.</p>
<p>IACHIMO The chimney</p>
<p>Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece 682</p>
<p>Chaste Dian bathing 683 : never saw I figures</p>
<p>So likely to report themselves 684 ; the cutter 685</p>
<p>Was as another nature dumb, outwent her 686 ,</p>
<p>Motion and breath left out 687 .</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS This is a thing</p>
<p>Which you might from relation likewise reap 688 ,</p>
<p>Being, as it is, much spoke of.</p>
<p>IACHIMO The roof o’th’chamber</p>
<p>With golden cherubins is fretted 689 . Her andirons 690 —</p>
<p>I had forgot them — were two winking 691 Cupids</p>
<p>Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely 692</p>
<p>Depending on their brands 693 .</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS This is her honour!</p>
<p>Let it be granted you have seen all this — and praise</p>
<p>Be given to your remembrance 694 — the description</p>
<p>Of what is in her chamber nothing saves 695</p>
<p>The wager you have laid.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Then if you can</p>
<p>Shows the bracelet</p>
<p>Be pale, I beg but leave 696 to air 697 this jewel: see,</p>
<p>And now ’tis up 698 again: it must be married</p>
<p>To that your diamond, I’ll keep them.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Jove!</p>
<p>Once more let me behold it: is it that</p>
<p>Which I left with her?</p>
<p>IACHIMO Sir — I thank her — that.</p>
<p>She stripped it from her arm: I see her yet 699 :</p>
<p>Her pretty action did outsell 700 her gift,</p>
<p>And yet enriched it too: she gave it me, and said</p>
<p>She prized 701 it once 702 .</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Maybe she plucked it off</p>
<p>To send it me.</p>
<p>IACHIMO She writes so to you, doth she?</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS O no, no, no, ’tis true. Here, take this too,</p>
<p>Gives the ring</p>
<p>It is a basilisk 703 unto mine eye,</p>
<p>Kills me to look on’t. Let there be no honour</p>
<p>Where there is beauty: truth, where semblance 704 : love,</p>
<p>Where there’s another man. The vows of women</p>
<p>Of no more bondage 705 be to where they are made</p>
<p>Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing.</p>
<p>O, above measure false!</p>
<p>PHILARIO Have patience, sir,</p>
<p>And take your ring again, ’tis not yet won:</p>
<p>It may be probable 706 she lost it: or</p>
<p>Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted 707 ,</p>
<p>Hath stol’n it from her?</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Very true,</p>
<p>And so 708 I hope he came by’t. Back 709 my ring,</p>
<p>Takes back the ring</p>
<p>Render to me some corporal sign 710 about her</p>
<p>More evident 711 than this: for this was stol’n.</p>
<p>IACHIMO By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Hark you, he swears: by Jupiter he swears.</p>
<p>’Tis true, nay, keep the ring, ’tis true: I am sure</p>
<p>She would not lose it: her attendants are</p>
<p>All sworn 712 and honourable: they induced to steal it?</p>
<p>And by a stranger? No, he hath enjoyed her 713 :</p>
<p>The cognizance 714 of her incontinency 715</p>
<p>Is this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly 716 .</p>
<p>There, take thy hire 717 , and all the fiends of hell</p>
<p>Gives the ring again</p>
<p>Divide themselves between you 718 !</p>
<p>PHILARIO Sir, be patient:</p>
<p>This is not strong enough to be believed</p>
<p>Of one persuaded 719 well of.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Never talk on’t:</p>
<p>She hath been colted 720 by him.</p>
<p>IACHIMO If you seek</p>
<p>For further satisfying, under her breast —</p>
<p>Worthy the pressing — lies a mole, right proud</p>
<p>Of that most delicate lodging. By my life,</p>
<p>I kissed it, and it gave me present 721 hunger</p>
<p>To feed again, though full. You do remember</p>
<p>This stain 722 upon her?</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Ay, and it doth confirm</p>
<p>Another stain, as big as hell can hold,</p>
<p>Were there no more but it.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Will you hear more?</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Spare your arithmetic, never count the turns 723 :</p>
<p>Once, and a million 724 !</p>
<p>IACHIMO I’ll be sworn.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS No swearing.</p>
<p>If you will swear you have not done’t, you lie,</p>
<p>And I will kill thee if thou dost deny</p>
<p>Thou’st 725 made me cuckold 726 .</p>
<p>IACHIMO I’ll deny nothing.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal 727 !</p>
<p>I will go there and do’t, i’th’court, before</p>
<p>Her father. I’ll do something.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>PHILARIO Quite besides 728</p>
<p>The government 729 of patience. You have won:</p>
<p>Let’s follow him and pervert 730 the present wrath</p>
<p>He hath against himself.</p>
<p>IACHIMO With all my heart.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Enter Posthumus</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Is there no way for men to be, but women</p>
<p>Must be half-workers 731 ? We are all bastards 732 ,</p>
<p>And that most venerable 733 man, which I</p>
<p>Did call my father, was I know not where</p>
<p>When I was stamped 734 . Some coiner 735 with his tools</p>
<p>Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seemed</p>
<p>The Dian of that time: so doth my wife</p>
<p>The nonpareil 736 of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!</p>
<p>Me of my lawful pleasure 737 she restrained,</p>
<p>And prayed me oft forbearance 738 : did it with</p>
<p>A pudency 739 so rosy 740 , the sweet view on’t 741</p>
<p>Might well have warmed old Saturn 742 , that I thought her</p>
<p>As chaste as unsunned snow. O, all the devils!</p>
<p>This yellow 743 Iachimo in an hour — wast not? —</p>
<p>Or less — at first 744 ? Perchance he spoke not, but</p>
<p>Like a full-acorned boar 745 , a German 746 one,</p>
<p>Cried ‘O!’ and mounted; found no opposition</p>
<p>But what he looked for 747 should oppose, and she</p>
<p>Should from encounter 748 guard. Could I find out</p>
<p>The woman’s part 749 in me — for there’s no motion 750</p>
<p>That tends to vice in man, but I affirm</p>
<p>It is the woman’s part: be it lying, note it,</p>
<p>The woman’s: flattering, hers: deceiving, hers:</p>
<p>Lust and rank 751 thoughts, hers, hers: revenges, hers:</p>
<p>Ambitions, covetings 752 , change of prides 753 , disdain,</p>
<p>Nice longing 754 , slanders, mutability 755 ,</p>
<p>All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,</p>
<p>Why, hers, in part or all: but rather all,</p>
<p>For even to vice</p>
<p>They are not constant, but are changing still 756</p>
<p>One vice, but of a minute old, for one</p>
<p>Not half so 757 old as that. I’ll write against them,</p>
<p>Detest them, curse them: yet ’tis greater skill 758</p>
<p>In a true hate, to pray they have their will 759 :</p>
<p>The very devils cannot plague them better.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
