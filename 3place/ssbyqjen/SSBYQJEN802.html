<h4 id="scene-1-352-running-scene-5">Scene 1 352 / running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter the King [Henry VI ], Queen [Margaret ], Protector [Gloucester
], Cardinal and Suffolk, with Falconers hallooing 353</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook 354 ,</p>
<p>I saw not better sport these seven years’ day 355 :</p>
<p>Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high,</p>
<p>And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out 356 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI But what a point 357 , my lord, your falcon made,</p>
<p>To Gloucester</p>
<p>And what a pitch 358 she flew above the rest:</p>
<p>To see how God in all his creatures works!</p>
<p>Yea, man and birds are fain of 359 climbing high.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK No marvel, an it like 360 your majesty,</p>
<p>My Lord Protector’s hawks do tower 361 so well:</p>
<p>They know their master loves to be aloft 362 ,</p>
<p>And bears his thoughts above his falcon’s pitch.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER My lord, ’tis but a base ignoble mind</p>
<p>That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.</p>
<p>CARDINAL I thought as much: he would be above the clouds.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Ay, my lord cardinal, how think you by that 363 ?</p>
<p>Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven?</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI The treasury of everlasting joy.</p>
<p>CARDINAL Thy heaven is on earth: thine eyes and thoughts</p>
<p>Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart,</p>
<p>Pernicious 364 Protector, dangerous peer,</p>
<p>That smooth’st it 365 so with king and commonweal!</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER What, cardinal?</p>
<p>Is your priesthood grown peremptory 366 ?</p>
<p>Tantaene animis coelestibus irae 367 ?</p>
<p>Churchmen so hot 368 ? Good uncle, hide such malice:</p>
<p>With such holiness, can you do it?</p>
<p>SUFFOLK No malice, sir, no more than well becomes</p>
<p>So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER As who, my lord?</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Why, as you, my lord,</p>
<p>An’t like your lordly Lord’s Protectorship.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET And thy ambition, Gloucester.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI I prithee, peace, good queen,</p>
<p>And whet not on 369 these furious peers,</p>
<p>For blessèd are the peacemakers on earth 370 .</p>
<p>CARDINAL Let me be blessèd for the peace I make</p>
<p>Against this proud Protector, with my sword.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Faith, holy uncle, would’t were come to that.</p>
<p>Gloucester and</p>
<p>CARDINAL Marry 371 , when thou dar’st.</p>
<p>Cardinal speak aside</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Make up no factious numbers for the matter 372 ,</p>
<p>In thine own person answer thy abuse 373 .</p>
<p>CARDINAL Ay, where thou dar’st not peep 374 : an if 375 thou
dar’st,</p>
<p>This evening, on the east side of the grove.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI How now, my lords?</p>
<p>CARDINAL Believe me, cousin Gloucester,</p>
<p>Had not your man 376 put up 377 the fowl so suddenly,</p>
<p>We had had 378 more sport.— Come with thy two-hand sword 379 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER True, uncle.—</p>
<p>Are ye advised? 380 The east side of the grove?</p>
<p>CARDINAL I am with you.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Why, how now, uncle Gloucester?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.—</p>
<p>Now, by God’s mother 381 crown 382 , priest, I’ll shave your crown
for this,</p>
<p>Or all my fence 383 shall fail.</p>
<p>CARDINAL Medice, teipsum 384 —</p>
<p>Protector, see to’t well, protect yourself.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI The winds grow high: so do your stomachs 385 ,
lords:</p>
<p>How irksome is this music to my heart!</p>
<p>When such strings jar 386 , what hope of harmony?</p>
<p>I pray, my lords, let me compound 387 this strife.</p>
<p>Enter one [Townsman ] crying ’ A miracle!’</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER What means this noise?</p>
<p>Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?</p>
<p>TOWNSMAN A miracle, a miracle!</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Come to the king and tell him what miracle.</p>
<p>TOWNSMAN Forsooth 388 , a blind man at Saint Alban’s shrine 389</p>
<p>Within this half-hour hath received his sight:</p>
<p>A man that ne’er saw in his life before.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Now, God be praised, that to believing souls</p>
<p>Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair.</p>
<p>Enter the Mayor of St Albans, and his brethren 390 , bearing the man
[Simpcox ] between two in a chair, [Simpcox’s Wife and Townspeople
following ]</p>
<p>CARDINAL Here comes the townsmen on procession,</p>
<p>To present your highness with the man.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Great is his comfort in this earthly vale 391 ,</p>
<p>Although by his sight his sin be multiplied 392 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Stand by, my masters, bring him near the king:</p>
<p>His highness’ pleasure is to talk with him.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance 393 ,</p>
<p>That we for thee may glorify the Lord.</p>
<p>What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?</p>
<p>SIMPCOX Born blind, an’t please your grace.</p>
<p>WIFE Ay, indeed, was he.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK What woman is this?</p>
<p>WIFE His wife, an’t like your worship.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have better told
394 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Where wert thou born?</p>
<p>To Simpcox</p>
<p>SIMPCOX At Berwick 395 in the north, an’t like your grace.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Poor soul, God’s goodness hath been great to thee:</p>
<p>Let never day nor night unhallowed 396 pass 397 ,</p>
<p>But still 398 remember what the Lord hath done.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Tell me, good fellow, cam’st thou here by chance,</p>
<p>To Simpcox</p>
<p>Or of 399 devotion, to this holy shrine?</p>
<p>SIMPCOX God knows, of pure devotion, being called</p>
<p>A hundred times and oft’ner in my sleep,</p>
<p>By good Saint Alban, who said, ’Simon, come:</p>
<p>Come offer 400 at my shrine, and I will help thee.’</p>
<p>WIFE Most true, forsooth: and many time and oft</p>
<p>Myself have heard a voice to call him so.</p>
<p>CARDINAL What, art thou lame?</p>
<p>SIMPCOX Ay, God Almighty help me.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK How cam’st thou so?</p>
<p>SIMPCOX A fall off of a tree 401 .</p>
<p>WIFE A plum tree, master.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER How long hast thou been blind?</p>
<p>SIMPCOX O, born so, master.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER What, and wouldst climb a tree?</p>
<p>SIMPCOX But that 402 in all my life, when I was a youth.</p>
<p>WIFE Too true, and bought his climbing very dear.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Mass 403 , thou lov’dst plums well, that wouldst venture
so.</p>
<p>SIMPCOX Alas, good master, my wife desired some damsons 404 ,</p>
<p>And made me climb 405 , with danger of my life.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER A subtle 406 knave, but yet it shall not serve 407 :</p>
<p>Let me see thine eyes: wink 408 now: now open them:</p>
<p>In my opinion, yet 409 thou see’st not well.</p>
<p>SIMPCOX Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and Saint Alban.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Say’st thou me so 410 : what colour is this cloak of?</p>
<p>SIMPCOX Red, master, red as blood.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Why, that’s well said: what colour is my gown of?</p>
<p>SIMPCOX Black, forsooth, coal-black as jet.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Why, then, thou know’st what colour jet is of?</p>
<p>SUFFOLK And yet, I think, jet did he never see.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many 411 .</p>
<p>WIFE Never, before this day, in all his life.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Tell me, sirrah, what’s my name?</p>
<p>SIMPCOX Alas, master, I know not.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER What’s his name?</p>
<p>SIMPCOX I know not.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Nor his?</p>
<p>SIMPCOX No, indeed, master.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER What’s thine own name?</p>
<p>SIMPCOX Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Then, Saunder, sit there, the lying’st knave in
Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou might’st as well have
known all our names as thus to name the several 412 colours we do wear.
Sight may distinguish of 413 colours, but suddenly to nominate 414 them
all, it is impossible.— My lords, Saint Alban here hath done a miracle:
and would ye not think his cunning 415 to be great, that could restore
this cripple to his legs again?</p>
<p>SIMPCOX O master, that you could!</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER My masters of St Albans, have you not beadles 416 in your
town, and things called whips?</p>
<p>MAYOR Yes, my lord, if it please your grace.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Then send for one presently 417 .</p>
<p>MAYOR Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight 418 .</p>
<p>Exit [a Townsperson ]</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Now fetch me a stool hither by and by 419 .— Now, sirrah,
if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me over this stool and
run away.</p>
<p>SIMPCOX Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone 420 : You go about
to torture me in vain.</p>
<p>Enter a Beadle with whips</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Well, sir, we must have you find your legs.— Sirrah
beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool.</p>
<p>BEADLE I will, my lord.— Come on, sirrah, off with your doublet 421
quickly.</p>
<p>SIMPCOX Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.</p>
<p>After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps over the stool and runs
away: and they follow and cry, ’ A miracle!’</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI O God, see’st thou this, and bearest 422 so long?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET It made me laugh to see the villain run.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Follow the knave, and take this drab 423 away.</p>
<p>WIFE Alas, sir, we did it for pure need.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Let them be whipped through every market town</p>
<p>Till they come to Berwick, from whence they came.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Wife, Beadle, Mayor and Townspeople ]</p>
<p>CARDINAL Duke Humphrey has done a miracle today.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK True: made the lame to leap and fly away.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER But you have done more miracles than I:</p>
<p>You made in a day, my lord, whole towns 424 to fly.</p>
<p>Enter Buckingham</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold:</p>
<p>A sort 425 of naughty 426 persons, lewdly bent 427 ,</p>
<p>Under the countenance and confederacy 428</p>
<p>Of Lady Eleanor, the Protector’s wife,</p>
<p>The ringleader and head of all this rout 429 ,</p>
<p>Have practised 430 dangerously against your state,</p>
<p>Dealing with witches and with conjurers,</p>
<p>Whom we have apprehended in the fact 431 ,</p>
<p>Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,</p>
<p>Demanding of 432 King Henry’s life and death,</p>
<p>And other of your highness’ Privy Council,</p>
<p>As more at large 433 your grace shall understand.</p>
<p>CARDINAL And so, my Lord Protector, by this means</p>
<p>Your lady is forthcoming yet 434 at London.</p>
<p>This news, I think, hath turned 435 your weapon’s edge:</p>
<p>’Tis like 436 , my lord, you will not keep your hour 437 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict 438 my heart:</p>
<p>Sorrow and grief have vanquished all my powers:</p>
<p>And, vanquished as I am, I yield to thee,</p>
<p>Or to the meanest groom 439 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,</p>
<p>Heaping confusion 440 on their own heads thereby!</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Gloucester, see here the tainture 441 of thy nest,</p>
<p>And look 442 thyself be faultless, thou wert best.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,</p>
<p>How I have loved my king and commonweal:</p>
<p>And for my wife, I know not how it stands 443 :</p>
<p>Sorry I am to hear what I have heard.</p>
<p>Noble she is: but if she have forgot</p>
<p>Honour and virtue and conversed 444 with such</p>
<p>As, like to pitch 445 , defile nobility,</p>
<p>I banish her my bed and company</p>
<p>And give her as a prey to law and shame,</p>
<p>That hath dishonoured Gloucester’s honest name.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Well, for this night we will repose us here:</p>
<p>Tomorrow toward London back again,</p>
<p>To look into this business thoroughly</p>
<p>And call these foul offenders to their answers,</p>
<p>And poise 446 the cause 447 in justice’ equal scales,</p>
<p>Whose beam stands sure 448 , whose rightful cause prevails</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt</p>
