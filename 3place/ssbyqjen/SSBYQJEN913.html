<h4 id="scene-1-323-running-scene-5">Scene 1 323 / running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter Pericles wet</p>
<p>PERICLES Yet cease your ire 324 , you angry stars of heaven!</p>
<p>Wind, rain and thunder, remember earthly man</p>
<p>Is but a substance that must yield to you,</p>
<p>And I, as fits my nature, do obey you.</p>
<p>Alas, the seas hath cast me on the rocks,</p>
<p>Washed me from shore to shore, and left my breath 325</p>
<p>Nothing to think on but ensuing death.</p>
<p>Let it suffice the greatness of your powers</p>
<p>To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes,</p>
<p>And having thrown him from your wat’ry grave,</p>
<p>Here to have death in peace is all he’ll crave.</p>
<p>Enter three Fishermen</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN What ho, Pilch 326 !</p>
<p>SECOND FISHERMAN Ha, come and bring away the nets.</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN What, Patch-breech 327 , I say!</p>
<p>THIRD FISHERMAN What say you, master?</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN Look how thou stirr’st now! 328</p>
<p>Come away, or I’ll fetch th’ 329 with a wanion 330 .</p>
<p>THIRD FISHERMAN Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that
were cast away before us even now.</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what
pitiful cries they made to us to help them when, well-a-day 331 , we
could scarce help ourselves.</p>
<p>THIRD FISHERMAN Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the
porpoise 332 how he bounced and tumbled? They say they’re half fish,
half flesh: a plague on them, they ne’er come but I look to be washed
333 . Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN Why, as men do a-land 334 : the grea ones eat up the
little ones. I can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly 335 as to
a 336 whale: a plays and tumbles, driving the poor fry 337 before him,
and, at last, devours them all at a mouthful. Such whales have I heard
on 338 o’th’land, who never leave gaping till they swallowed the whole
parish: church, steeple, bells and all.</p>
<p>PERICLES A pretty 339 moral 340 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>THIRD FISHERMAN But master, if I had been the sexton 341 , I would
have been that day in the belfry 342 .</p>
<p>SECOND FISHERMAN Why, man?</p>
<p>THIRD FISHERMAN Because he should have swallowed me too, and when I
had been in his belly I would have kept such a jangling of the bells
that he should never have left till he cast 343 bells, steeple, church
and parish up again! But if the good King Simonides were of my mind—</p>
<p>PERICLES Simonides?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>THIRD FISHERMAN We would purge the land of these drones that rob the
bee of her honey 344 .</p>
<p>PERICLES How from the finny subject 345 of the sea</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>These fishers tell the infirmities of men,</p>
<p>And from their wat’ry empire recollect 346</p>
<p>All that may men approve or men detect 347 .—</p>
<p>Peace be at your labour, honest fishermen.</p>
<p>To Fishermen</p>
<p>SECOND FISHERMAN ‘Honest’, good fellow? What’s that? If it be a day
fits you, search’t 348 out of the calendar and nobody will look after
it! 349</p>
<p>PERICLES May 350 see the sea hath cast 351 upon your coast —</p>
<p>SECOND FISHERMAN What a drunken knave was the sea to cast 352 thee in
our way!</p>
<p>PERICLES A man, whom both the waters and the wind</p>
<p>In that vast tennis-court 353 hath made the ball</p>
<p>For them to play upon, entreats you pity him:</p>
<p>He asks of you that never used 354 to beg.</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN No, friend, cannot you beg? Here’s them 355 in our
country of Greece gets more with begging than we can do with
working.</p>
<p>SECOND FISHERMAN Canst thou catch any fishes then?</p>
<p>PERICLES I never practised it.</p>
<p>SECOND FISHERMAN Nay, then thou wilt starve sure, for here’s nothing
to be got nowadays unless thou canst fish for’t 356 .</p>
<p>PERICLES What I have been I have forgot to know,</p>
<p>But what I am, want teaches me to think on:</p>
<p>A man thronged up 357 with cold. My veins are chill,</p>
<p>And have no more of life than may suffice</p>
<p>To give my tongue that heat to ask your help,</p>
<p>Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead,</p>
<p>For that 358 I am a man, pray you 359 see me burièd.</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN ‘Die’, quotha 360 ? Now gods forbid’t 361 , an
362</p>
<p>I have a gown here.</p>
<p>Gives a gown to Pericles</p>
<p>Come, put it on, keep thee warm: now, afore me 363 , a handsome
fellow! Come, thou shalt go home, and we’ll have flesh for holidays,
fish for fasting-days 364 and, moreo’er, puddings 365 and flapjacks 366
, and thou shalt be welcome.</p>
<p>PERICLES I thank you, sir.</p>
<p>SECOND FISHERMAN Hark you, my friend — you said you could not
beg?</p>
<p>PERICLES I did but crave 367 .</p>
<p>SECOND FISHERMAN But crave? Then I’ll turn craver 368 too, and so I
shall scape whipping.</p>
<p>PERICLES Why, are your beggars whipped, then?</p>
<p>SECOND FISHERMAN O, not all, my friend, not all: for if all your
beggars were whipped I would wish no better office than to be beadle 369
. But, master, I’ll go draw up the net.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Second and Third Fishermen ]</p>
<p>PERICLES How well this honest mirth becomes 370 their labour!</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN Hark you, sir, do you know where ye are?</p>
<p>PERICLES Not well.</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN Why, I’ll tell you: this is called</p>
<p>Pentapolis 371 , and our king, the good Simonides.</p>
<p>PERICLES The good Simonides, do you call him?</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN Ay, sir, and he deserves so to be called for his
peaceable reign and good government.</p>
<p>PERICLES He is a happy king, since he gains from</p>
<p>His subjects the name of good by his government.</p>
<p>How far is his court distant from this shore?</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN Marry 372 , sir, half a day’s journey.</p>
<p>And I’ll tell you, he hath a fair daughter, and tomorrow is her
birthday, and there are princes and knights come from all parts of the
world to joust and tourney 373 for her love.</p>
<p>PERICLES Were my fortunes equal to my desires,</p>
<p>I could wish to make one 374 there.</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN O, sir, things must be as they may, and what a man
cannot get he may lawfully deal for his wife’s soul 375 .</p>
<p>Enter the two Fishermen, drawing up a net</p>
<p>SECOND FISHERMAN Help, master, help! Here’s a fish hangs in the net
like a poor man’s right 376 in the law: ’twill hardly come out 377 . Ha,
bots 378 on’t 379 , ’tis come at last, and ’tis turned to a rusty
armour.</p>
<p>They pull pieces of armour from the net</p>
<p>PERICLES An armour, friends? I pray you let me see it.</p>
<p>Thanks Fortune yet, that after all crosses 380</p>
<p>Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself.</p>
<p>And though it was mine own, part of my heritage 381 ,</p>
<p>Which my dead father did bequeath to me</p>
<p>With this strict charge 382 even as he left his life:</p>
<p>’Keep it my Pericles, it hath been a shield</p>
<p>‘Twixt me and death’ — and pointed to this brace 383 —</p>
<p>’For that 384 it saved me, keep it: in like necessity 385 ,</p>
<p>The which the gods protect thee from, may’t defend thee.’</p>
<p>It kept 386 where I kept, I so dearly loved it,</p>
<p>Till the rough seas, that spares not any man,</p>
<p>Took it in rage, though calmed have given’t again 387 .</p>
<p>I thank thee for’t, my shipwreck now’s no ill</p>
<p>Since I have here my father 388 gave in his will.</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN What mean you, sir?</p>
<p>PERICLES To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth 389 ,</p>
<p>For it was sometime 390 target 391 to a king:</p>
<p>I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,</p>
<p>And for his sake I wish the having of it,</p>
<p>And that you’d guide me to your sovereign’s court,</p>
<p>Where with it I may appear a gentleman.</p>
<p>And if that ever my low fortune’s better</p>
<p>I’ll pay your bounties 392 , till then rest 393 your debtor.</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN Why, wilt thou tourney 394 for the lady?</p>
<p>PERICLES I’ll show the virtue 395 I have borne in arms.</p>
<p>FIRST FISHERMAN Why, d’ye take it 396 , and the gods give thee good
on’t 397 !</p>
<p>Pericles puts on the armour</p>
<p>SECOND FISHERMAN Ay, but hark you, my friend, ’twas we that made up
398 this garment through the rough seams 399 of the waters. There are
certain condolements 400 , certain vails 401 : I hope, sir, if you
thrive you’ll remember from whence you had them.</p>
<p>PERICLES Believe’t, I will.</p>
<p>By your furtherance 402 I am clothed in steel,</p>
<p>And spite of all the rapture 403 of the sea</p>
<p>This jewel holds his building 404 on my arm.</p>
<p>Unto thy value 405 I will mount myself</p>
<p>Upon a courser 406 , whose delightful steps</p>
<p>Shall make the gazer 407 joy to see him tread.</p>
<p>Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided</p>
<p>Of a pair of bases 408 —</p>
<p>SECOND FISHERMAN We’ll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to
make thee a pair, and I’ll bring thee to the court myself.</p>
<p>PERICLES Then honour be but a goad 409 to my will 410 ,</p>
<p>This day I’ll rise, or else add ill to ill.</p>
<p>[Exeunt ]</p>
