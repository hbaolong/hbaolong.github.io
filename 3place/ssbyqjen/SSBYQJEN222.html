<h4 id="scene-1-186-running-scene-2">Scene 1 186 / running scene 2</h4>
<p>Enter Lucentio 187 and his man Tranio</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Tranio, since for the great desire I had</p>
<p>To see fair Padua 188 , nursery 189 of arts,</p>
<p>I am arrived for 190 fruitful Lombardy 191 ,</p>
<p>The pleasant garden of great Italy,</p>
<p>And by my father’s love and leave 192 am armed</p>
<p>With his good will and thy good company,</p>
<p>My trusty servant, well approved 193 in all,</p>
<p>Here let us breathe 194 and haply 195 institute 196</p>
<p>A course of learning and ingenious 197 studies.</p>
<p>Pisa, renownèd for grave 198 citizens,</p>
<p>Gave me my being and my father first 199 ,</p>
<p>A merchant of great traffic 200 through the world,</p>
<p>Vincentio come of 201 the Bentivolii 202 .</p>
<p>Vincentio’s son, brought up in Florence,</p>
<p>It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,</p>
<p>To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds 203 :</p>
<p>And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,</p>
<p>Virtue and that part of philosophy</p>
<p>Will I apply that treats of 204 happiness</p>
<p>By virtue specially to be achieved.</p>
<p>Tell me thy mind, for I have Pisa left</p>
<p>And am to Padua come, as he that leaves</p>
<p>A shallow plash 205 to plunge him in the deep</p>
<p>And with satiety 206 seeks to quench his thirst.</p>
<p>TRANIO Mi perdonato 207 , gentle master mine.</p>
<p>I am in all affected 208 as yourself,</p>
<p>Glad that you thus continue your resolve</p>
<p>To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.</p>
<p>Only, good master, while we do admire</p>
<p>This virtue and this moral discipline,</p>
<p>Let’s be no stoics 209 nor no stocks 210 , I pray,</p>
<p>Or so devote to Aristotle 211 ’s checks 212</p>
<p>As 213 Ovid 214 be an outcast quite abjured 215 .</p>
<p>Balk 216 logic with acquaintance that you have</p>
<p>And practise rhetoric in your common 217 talk,</p>
<p>Music and poesy use to quicken 218 you;</p>
<p>The mathematics and the metaphysics,</p>
<p>Fall to 219 them as you find your stomach serves you 220 .</p>
<p>No profit grows where is no pleasure ta’en 221 :</p>
<p>In brief, sir, study what you most affect 222 .</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Gramercies 223 , Tranio, well dost thou advise.</p>
<p>If, Biondello, thou wert 224 come ashore,</p>
<p>We could at once put us in readiness,</p>
<p>And take a lodging fit to entertain</p>
<p>Such friends as time in Padua shall beget 225 .</p>
<p>But stay a while, what company is this?</p>
<p>TRANIO Master, some show to welcome us to town.</p>
<p>Enter Baptista with his two daughters, Katherina and Bianca 226 ,
Gremio a pantaloon 227 , Hortensio suitor to Bianca. Lucentio [and ]
Tranio stand by</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Gentlemen, importune 228 me no farther,</p>
<p>For how I firmly am resolved you know:</p>
<p>That is, not to bestow 229 my youngest daughter</p>
<p>Before I have a husband for the elder.</p>
<p>If either of you both love Katherina,</p>
<p>Because I know you well and love you well,</p>
<p>Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.</p>
<p>GREMIO To cart her 230 rather. She’s too rough 231 for me.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>There, there, Hortensio, will you 232 any wife?</p>
<p>KATE I pray you, sir, is it your will</p>
<p>To Baptista</p>
<p>To make a stale 233 of me amongst these mates 234 ?</p>
<p>HORTENSIO ‘Mates’, maid? How mean you that? No mates for you,</p>
<p>Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.</p>
<p>KATE I’faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:</p>
<p>Iwis 235 it is not halfway to her heart 236 .</p>
<p>But if it were, doubt not her care 237 should be</p>
<p>To comb your noddle 238 with a three-legged stool</p>
<p>And paint 239 your face and use 240 you like a fool.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO From all such devils, good lord deliver us!</p>
<p>GREMIO And me too, good lord!</p>
<p>TRANIO Husht, master! Here’s some good pastime toward 241 ;</p>
<p>Aside to Lucentio</p>
<p>That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward 242 .</p>
<p>LUCENTIO But in the other’s silence do I see</p>
<p>Aside to Tranio</p>
<p>Maid’s mild behaviour and sobriety.</p>
<p>Peace, Tranio!</p>
<p>TRANIO Well said, master. Mum 243 , and gaze your fill.</p>
<p>Aside to Lucentio</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Gentlemen, that I may soon make good</p>
<p>What I have said, Bianca, get you in,</p>
<p>And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,</p>
<p>For I will love thee ne’er the less, my girl.</p>
<p>KATE A pretty peat 244 ! It is best</p>
<p>Put finger in the eye, an she knew why 245 .</p>
<p>BIANCA Sister, content you 246 in my discontent.</p>
<p>Sir, to your pleasure 247 humbly I subscribe 248 :</p>
<p>My books and instruments shall be my company,</p>
<p>On them to look and practise by myself.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Hark, Tranio, thou may’st hear Minerva 249 speak.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Signior Baptista, will you be so strange 250 ?</p>
<p>Sorry am I that our good will effects 251</p>
<p>Bianca’s grief.</p>
<p>GREMIO Why will you mew her up 252 ,</p>
<p>Signior Baptista, for 253 this fiend of hell,</p>
<p>And make her 254 bear the penance of her 255 tongue?</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Gentlemen, content ye, I am resolved.—</p>
<p>Go in, Bianca.—</p>
<p>[Exit Bianca ]</p>
<p>And for 256 I know she taketh most delight</p>
<p>In music, instruments and poetry,</p>
<p>Schoolmasters will I keep within my house</p>
<p>Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,</p>
<p>Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,</p>
<p>Prefer 257 them hither, for to cunning 258 men</p>
<p>I will be very kind, and liberal</p>
<p>To mine own children in good bringing up.</p>
<p>And so farewell.— Katherina, you may stay,</p>
<p>For I have more to commune 259 with Bianca.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KATE Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What, shall I be
appointed hours 260 , as though, belike 261 , I knew not what to take
and what to leave? Ha?</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>GREMIO You may go to the devil’s dam 262 . Your gifts 263 are so
good, here’s none will hold you 264 .— Their love 265 is not so great,
Hortensio, but we may blow our nails 266 together, and fast it fairly
out 267 . Our cake’s dough on both sides 268 . Farewell. Yet for the
love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on 269 a fit
man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish 270 him to her
father.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO So will I, Signior Gremio. But a word, I pray. Though the
nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle 271 , know now, upon
advice 272 , it toucheth 273 us both — that we may yet again have access
to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca’s love — to labour
and effect 274 one thing specially.</p>
<p>GREMIO What’s that, I pray?</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.</p>
<p>GREMIO A husband? A devil.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO I say a husband.</p>
<p>GREMIO I say a devil. Think’st thou, Hortensio, though her father be
very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Tush, Gremio, though it pass 275 your patience and mine to
endure her loud alarums 276 , why, man, there be good fellows in the
world, an 277 a man could light on them, would take her with all faults,
and money enough.</p>
<p>GREMIO I cannot tell, but I had as lief 278 take her dowry with this
condition: to be whipped at the high cross 279 every morning.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Faith, as you say, there’s small choice in rotten apples.
But come, since this bar in law 280 makes us friends, it shall be so far
forth friendly maintained 281 till by helping Baptista’s eldest daughter
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have to’t
afresh 282 . Sweet Bianca! Happy man be his dole! 283 He that runs
fastest gets the ring 284 . How say you, Signior Gremio?</p>
<p>GREMIO I am agreed, and would I had given him the best horse in Padua
to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her
and rid the house of her! Come on.</p>
<p>Exeunt both [Gremio and Hortensio ]. Tranio and Lucentio remain</p>
<p>TRANIO I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible</p>
<p>That love should of a sudden take such hold?</p>
<p>LUCENTIO O Tranio, till I found it to be true,</p>
<p>I never thought it possible or likely.</p>
<p>But see, while idly I stood looking on,</p>
<p>I found the effect of love in idleness 285 ,</p>
<p>And now in plainness do confess to thee,</p>
<p>That art to me as secret 286 and as dear</p>
<p>As Anna to the Queen of Carthage 287 was,</p>
<p>Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,</p>
<p>If I achieve not this young modest girl.</p>
<p>Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst.</p>
<p>Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.</p>
<p>TRANIO Master, it is no time to chide you now.</p>
<p>Affection is not rated 288 from the heart:</p>
<p>If love have touched you, naught remains but so,</p>
<p>Redime 289 te captum quam queas minimo .</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Gramercies, lad. Go forward 290 . This 291 contents:</p>
<p>The rest will comfort, for thy counsel’s sound.</p>
<p>TRANIO Master, you looked so longly 292 on the maid,</p>
<p>Perhaps you marked not 293 what’s the pith 294 of all.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,</p>
<p>Such as the daughter of Agenor 295 had,</p>
<p>That made great Jove to humble him 296 to her hand.</p>
<p>When with his knees he kissed 297 the Cretan strand 298 .</p>
<p>TRANIO Saw you no more? Marked you not how her sister</p>
<p>Began to scold and raise up such a storm</p>
<p>That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move</p>
<p>And with her breath she did perfume the air.</p>
<p>Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.</p>
<p>TRANIO Nay, then, ’tis time to stir him from his trance.—</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>I pray, awake, sir. If you love the maid,</p>
<p>Bend 299 thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:</p>
<p>Her elder sister is so curst 300 and shrewd 301</p>
<p>That till the father rid his hands of her,</p>
<p>Master, your love must live a maid 302 at home,</p>
<p>And therefore has he closely 303 mewed her up,</p>
<p>Because she will not be annoyed 304 with suitors.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father’s he!</p>
<p>But art thou not advised 305 he took some care</p>
<p>To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?</p>
<p>TRANIO Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now ’tis plotted.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO I have it, Tranio.</p>
<p>TRANIO Master, for my hand 306 ,</p>
<p>Both our inventions meet 307 and jump 308 in one.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Tell me thine first.</p>
<p>TRANIO You will be schoolmaster</p>
<p>And undertake the teaching of the maid:</p>
<p>That’s your device 309 .</p>
<p>LUCENTIO It is: may it be done?</p>
<p>TRANIO Not possible, for who shall bear 310 your part,</p>
<p>And be in Padua here Vincentio’s son,</p>
<p>Keep house 311 and ply his book 312 , welcome his friends,</p>
<p>Visit his countrymen and banquet them?</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Basta 313 , content thee, for I have it full 314 .</p>
<p>We have not yet been seen in any house,</p>
<p>Nor can we be distinguished by our faces</p>
<p>For man or master. Then it follows thus:</p>
<p>Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,</p>
<p>Keep house and port 315 and servants as I should.</p>
<p>I will some other be, some Florentine,</p>
<p>Some Neapolitan, or meaner 316 man of Pisa.</p>
<p>’Tis hatched and shall be so. Tranio, at once</p>
<p>Uncase 317 thee: take my coloured 318 hat and cloak.</p>
<p>They exchange clothes</p>
<p>When Biondello comes, he waits on thee,</p>
<p>But I will charm 319 him first to keep his tongue.</p>
<p>TRANIO So had you need.</p>
<p>In brief, sir, sith 320 it your pleasure is,</p>
<p>And I am tied 321 to be obedient —</p>
<p>For so your father charged 322 me at our parting,</p>
<p>‘Be serviceable to my son’, quoth he,</p>
<p>Although I think ’twas in another sense —</p>
<p>I am content to be Lucentio,</p>
<p>Because so well I love Lucentio.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves.</p>
<p>And let me be a slave, t’achieve that maid</p>
<p>Whose sudden sight 323 hath thralled 324 my wounded 325 eye.</p>
<p>Enter Biondello</p>
<p>Here comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?</p>
<p>BIONDELLO Where have I been? Nay, how now? Where are you? Master, has
my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or you stolen his? Or both? Pray,
what’s the news?</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Sirrah, come hither. ’Tis no time to jest,</p>
<p>And therefore frame 326 your manners to the time.</p>
<p>Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,</p>
<p>Puts my apparel and my count’nance 327 on,</p>
<p>And I for my escape have put on his,</p>
<p>For in a quarrel since I came ashore</p>
<p>I killed a man, and fear I was descried 328 .</p>
<p>Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes 329 ,</p>
<p>While I make way from hence to save my life.</p>
<p>You understand me?</p>
<p>BIONDELLO I, sir? Ne’er a whit.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth.</p>
<p>Tranio is changed into Lucentio.</p>
<p>BIONDELLO The better for him. Would I were so too!</p>
<p>TRANIO So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,</p>
<p>That Lucentio indeed had Baptista’s youngest daughter.</p>
<p>But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master’s, I advise</p>
<p>You use your manners discreetly 330 in all kind of companies:</p>
<p>When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio,</p>
<p>But in all places else your master Lucentio.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Tranio, let’s go. One thing more rests 331 that thyself
execute 332 : to make 333 one among these wooers. If thou ask me why,
sufficeth 334 my reasons are both good and weighty.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>The Presenters above 335 speaks</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN My lord, you nod. You do not mind 336 the play.</p>
<p>SLY Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter 337 , surely.</p>
<p>Comes there any more of it?</p>
<p>PAGE My lord, ’tis but begun.</p>
<p>SLY ’Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady.</p>
<p>Would 338 ’twere done!</p>
<p>They sit and mark 339</p>
