21</h4>
<p>Enter Suffolk in conference with King [Henry VI ], Gloucester and
Exeter</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,</p>
<p>Of beauteous Margaret hath astonished me:</p>
<p>Her virtues gracèd with external gifts</p>
<p>Do breed love’s settled 1416 passions in my heart,</p>
<p>And like as rigour 1417 of tempestuous gusts</p>
<p>Provokes 1418 the mightiest hulk 1419 against the tide,</p>
<p>So am I driven by breath of her renown</p>
<p>Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive</p>
<p>Where I may have fruition of her love.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale</p>
<p>Is but a preface of her worthy praise 1420 :</p>
<p>The chief perfections of that lovely dame,</p>
<p>Had I sufficient skill to utter them,</p>
<p>Would make a volume of enticing lines,</p>
<p>Able to ravish any dull conceit 1421 :</p>
<p>And, which is more, she is not so divine,</p>
<p>So full 1422 replete with choice of all delights,</p>
<p>But with as humble lowliness 1423 of mind</p>
<p>She is content to be at your command:</p>
<p>Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,</p>
<p>To love and honour Henry as her lord.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI And otherwise will Henry ne’er presume:</p>
<p>Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent</p>
<p>That Margaret may be England’s royal queen.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER So should I give consent to flatter 1424 sin.</p>
<p>You know, my lord, your highness is betrothed</p>
<p>Unto another lady of esteem 1425 :</p>
<p>How shall we then dispense with that contract 1426 ,</p>
<p>And not deface your honour with reproach 1427 ?</p>
<p>SUFFOLK As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths,</p>
<p>Or one that, at a triumph 1428 having vowed</p>
<p>To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists 1429</p>
<p>By reason of his adversary’s odds.</p>
<p>A poor earl’s daughter is unequal odds,</p>
<p>And therefore may be broke 1430 without offence.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?</p>
<p>Her father is no better than an earl,</p>
<p>Although in glorious titles he excel.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Yes, my lord, her father is a king,</p>
<p>The King of Naples and Jerusalem,</p>
<p>And of such great authority in France</p>
<p>As his alliance will confirm 1431 our peace</p>
<p>And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,</p>
<p>Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.</p>
<p>EXETER Beside, his wealth doth warrant 1432 a liberal dower,</p>
<p>Where 1433 Reignier sooner will receive than give.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK A dower, my lords? Disgrace not so your king,</p>
<p>That he should be so abject, base and poor,</p>
<p>To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.</p>
<p>Henry is able to enrich his queen,</p>
<p>And not to seek a queen to make him rich:</p>
<p>So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,</p>
<p>As market men for oxen, sheep, or horse.</p>
<p>Marriage is a matter of more worth</p>
<p>Than to be dealt in by attorneyship 1434 :</p>
<p>Not whom we will 1435 , but whom his grace affects 1436 ,</p>
<p>Must be companion of his nuptial bed.</p>
<p>And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,</p>
<p>Most of all these reasons bindeth us,</p>
<p>In our opinions she should be preferred 1437 .</p>
<p>For what is wedlock forcèd but a hell,</p>
<p>An age of discord and continual strife?</p>
<p>Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,</p>
<p>And is a pattern 1438 of celestial peace.</p>
<p>Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,</p>
<p>But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?</p>
<p>Her peerless feature 1439 , joinèd with her birth,</p>
<p>Approves 1440 her fit for none but for a king 1441 :</p>
<p>Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,</p>
<p>More than in women commonly is seen,</p>
<p>Will answer our hope in issue of a king.</p>
<p>For Henry, son unto a conqueror,</p>
<p>Is likely to beget more conquerors,</p>
<p>If with a lady of so high resolve 1442 ,</p>
<p>As is fair Margaret, he be linked in love.</p>
<p>Then yield, my lords, and here conclude with me</p>
<p>That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Whether it be through force of your report,</p>
<p>My noble lord of Suffolk, or for that 1443</p>
<p>My tender youth was never yet attaint 1444</p>
<p>With any passion of inflaming love,</p>
<p>I cannot tell: but this I am assured,</p>
<p>I feel such sharp dissension 1445 in my breast,</p>
<p>Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,</p>
<p>As I am sick with working of my thoughts.</p>
<p>Take therefore shipping: post 1446 , my lord, to France:</p>
<p>Agree to any covenants, and procure 1447</p>
<p>That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come</p>
<p>To cross the seas to England, and be crowned</p>
<p>King Henry’s faithful and anointed 1448 queen.</p>
<p>For your expenses and sufficient charge 1449 ,</p>
<p>Among the people gather up a tenth 1450 .</p>
<p>Be gone, I say, for, till you do return,</p>
<p>I rest perplexèd with a thousand cares.</p>
<p>And you, good uncle, banish all offence 1451 :</p>
<p>If you do censure 1452 me by what you were 1453 ,</p>
<p>Not what you are, I know it will excuse</p>
<p>This sudden execution of my will.</p>
<p>And so conduct me where from company 1454</p>
<p>I may revolve and ruminate 1455 my grief 1456 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.</p>
<p>Exit [with Exeter ]</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Thus Suffolk hath prevailed, and thus he goes</p>
<p>As did the youthful Paris once to Greece 1457 ,</p>
<p>With hope to find the like event 1458 in love,</p>
<p>But prosper better than the Trojan did:</p>
<p>Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king:</p>
<p>But I will rule both her, the king, and realm.</p>
<p>Exit</p>

<p>1.4.10 Wont = Ed. F = Went 27 Earl = F. Ed. = Duke 66 lords = F. Ed =
Lou 69 SD shoot = Ed. F = shot SD fall = Ed. F = falls 89 Bear … it
moved from its position in F two lines before, since the body referred
to cannot be that of Salisbury, and must be that of Gargrave 95 Nero =
Ed</p>
<p>1.6.21 pyramid = Ed. F = pyramis 22 of = Ed. F = or</p>
<p>2.1.5 SH FIRST SENTINEL = Ed. F = Sent . 80 SD [ The French ] fly =

line above)</p>
