<h4 id="scene-3-685-running-scene-6">Scene 3 685 / running scene 6</h4>
<p>Enter Count [Bertram ], Lafew and Parolles</p>
<p>LAFEW They say miracles are past, and we have our philosophical
persons 686 to make modern 687 and familiar, things 688 supernatural and
causeless 689 . Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing
ourselves into 690 seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to
an unknown fear 691 .</p>
<p>PAROLLES Why, ’tis the rarest 692 argument 693 of wonder that hath
shot out 694 in our latter 695 times.</p>
<p>BERTRAM And so ’tis.</p>
<p>LAFEW To be relinquished of 696 the artists 697 —</p>
<p>PAROLLES So I say, both of Galen 698 and Paracelsus 699 .</p>
<p>LAFEW Of all the learnèd and authentic fellows 700 —</p>
<p>PAROLLES Right, so I say.</p>
<p>LAFEW That gave him out 701 incurable—</p>
<p>PAROLLES Why, there ’tis. So say I too.</p>
<p>LAFEW Not to be helped —</p>
<p>PAROLLES Right. As ’twere a man assured of a—</p>
<p>LAFEW Uncertain life and sure death.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Just 702 , you say well. So would I have said.</p>
<p>LAFEW I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.</p>
<p>PAROLLES It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing 703 , you
shall read it in— what-do-ye-call there?</p>
<p>Points to the ballad Lafew holds</p>
<p>LAFEW ‘A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>PAROLLES That’s it. I would have said the very same.</p>
<p>LAFEW Why, your dolphin 704 is not lustier. ’Fore me 705 , I speak in
respect—</p>
<p>PAROLLES Nay, ’tis strange, ’tis very strange. That is the brief and
the tedious 706 of it, and he’s of a most facinerious 707 spirit that
will not acknowledge it to be the—</p>
<p>LAFEW Very hand of heaven.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Ay, so I say.</p>
<p>LAFEW In a most weak—</p>
<p>PAROLLES And debile minister 708 , great power, great transcendence,
which should indeed give us a further use to be made than alone the
recovery of the king, as to be—</p>
<p>LAFEW Generally 709 thankful.</p>
<p>Enter King, Helen and Attendants</p>
<p>PAROLLES I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.</p>
<p>Lafew and Parolles stand aside</p>
<p>LAFEW Lustigu e 710 , as the Dutchman 711 says. I’ll like a maid the
better whilst I have a tooth 712 in my head. Why, he’s able to lead her
a coranto 713 .</p>
<p>PAROLLES Mor du vinage r 714 ! Is not this Helen?</p>
<p>LAFEW ’Fore God, I think so.</p>
<p>KING Go, call before me all the lords in court.</p>
<p>[Exit Attendant ]</p>
<p>Sit, my preserver, by thy patient’s side,</p>
<p>Helen sits</p>
<p>And with this healthful hand, whose banished sense 715</p>
<p>Thou hast repealed 716 , a second time receive</p>
<p>The confirmation of my promised gift,</p>
<p>Which but attends 717 thy naming.</p>
<p>Enter three or four Lords</p>
<p>Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel 718</p>
<p>Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing 719 ,</p>
<p>O’er whom both sovereign power and father’s voice</p>
<p>I have to use. Thy frank election 720 make.</p>
<p>Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake 721 .</p>
<p>HELEN To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress</p>
<p>Fall, when love please! Marry, to each, but one!</p>
<p>LAFEW I’d give bay curtal and his furniture 722</p>
<p>My mouth no more were broken than these boys’ 723 ,</p>
<p>And writ 724 as little beard.</p>
<p>KING Peruse them well:</p>
<p>Not one of those but had a noble father.</p>
<p>HELEN Gentlemen, heaven hath through me restored the king to
health.</p>
<p>She addresses her to a Lord 725</p>
<p>ALL We understand it, and thank heaven for you.</p>
<p>HELEN I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest</p>
<p>That I protest 726 I simply am a maid.</p>
<p>Please it your majesty, I have done already.</p>
<p>The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper 727 me,</p>
<p>’We blush that thou shouldst choose. But be refused,</p>
<p>Let the white death 728 sit on thy cheek for ever,</p>
<p>We’ll ne’er come there again.’</p>
<p>KING Make choice and see,</p>
<p>Who 729 shuns thy love shuns all his love in me 730 .</p>
<p>HELEN Now, Dian 731 , from thy altar do I fly,</p>
<p>And to imperial Love 732 , that god most high,</p>
<p>Do my sighs stream.— Sir, will you hear my suit?</p>
<p>To First Lord</p>
<p>FIRST LORD And grant it.</p>
<p>HELEN Thanks, sir. All the rest is mute 733 .</p>
<p>LAFEW I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace 734 for my
life 735 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>HELEN The honour 736 , sir, that flames in your fair eyes</p>
<p>To Second Lord</p>
<p>Before I speak, too threat’ningly replies.</p>
<p>Love 737 make your fortunes twenty times above</p>
<p>Her that so wishes 738 , and her humble love.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD No better 739 , if you please.</p>
<p>HELEN My wish receive,</p>
<p>Which great love grant! And so I take my leave.</p>
<p>LAFEW Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine, I’d have them
whipped, or I would send them to th’Turk 740 to make eunuchs of.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>HELEN Be not afraid that I your hand should take.</p>
<p>To Third Lord</p>
<p>I’ll never do you wrong for your own sake.</p>
<p>Blessing upon your vows, and in your bed</p>
<p>Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!</p>
<p>LAFEW These boys are boys of ice, they’ll none have her. Sure 741
they are bastards to the English, the French ne’er got 742 ’em.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>HELEN You are too young, too happy 743 , and too good, To make
yourself a son out of my blood.</p>
<p>To Fourth Lord</p>
<p>FOURTH LORD Fair one, I think not so.</p>
<p>LAFEW There’s one grape 744 yet. I am sure thy father drunk wine 745
. But if thou be’st not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen. I have known
746 thee already.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>HELEN I dare not say I take you, but I give</p>
<p>To Bertram</p>
<p>Me and my service, ever whilst I live,</p>
<p>Into your guiding power. This is the man.</p>
<p>KING Why, then, young Bertram, take her: she’s thy wife.</p>
<p>BERTRAM My wife, my liege? I shall beseech your highness,</p>
<p>In such a business give me leave to use</p>
<p>The help of mine own eyes.</p>
<p>KING Know’st thou not, Bertram, what she has done for me?</p>
<p>BERTRAM Yes, my good lord,</p>
<p>But never hope to know why I should marry her.</p>
<p>KING Thou know’st she has raised me from my sickly bed.</p>
<p>BERTRAM But follows it, my lord, to bring me down 747</p>
<p>Must answer for your raising? I know her well:</p>
<p>She had her breeding 748 at my father’s charge 749 .</p>
<p>A poor physician’s daughter my wife? Disdain</p>
<p>Rather corrupt 750 me ever 751 !</p>
<p>KING ’Tis only title 752 thou disdain’st in her, the which</p>
<p>I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,</p>
<p>Of colour, weight and heat, poured all together,</p>
<p>Would quite confound distinction 753 , yet stands off 754</p>
<p>In differences so mighty. If she be</p>
<p>All that is virtuous, save what thou dislik’st,</p>
<p>A poor physician’s daughter, thou dislik’st</p>
<p>Of virtue for the name. But do not so.</p>
<p>From lowest place whence virtuous things proceed 755 ,</p>
<p>The place is dignified by th’doer’s deed.</p>
<p>Where great additions swell’s, and virtue none 756 ,</p>
<p>It is a dropsied 757 honour. Good alone</p>
<p>Is good without a name. Vileness is so:</p>
<p>The property 758 by what it is should go 759 ,</p>
<p>Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair.</p>
<p>In these to nature she’s immediate heir 760 ,</p>
<p>And these breed honour. That is honour’s scorn,</p>
<p>Which challenges itself as honour’s born</p>
<p>And is not like the sire 761 . Honours thrive,</p>
<p>When rather from our acts we them derive</p>
<p>Than our foregoers 762 . The mere word’s a slave,</p>
<p>Deboshed 763 on every tomb, on every grave</p>
<p>A lying trophy 764 , and as oft is dumb,</p>
<p>Where dust and damned oblivion is the tomb</p>
<p>Of honoured bones indeed 765 . What should be said?</p>
<p>If thou canst like this creature as a maid,</p>
<p>I can create the rest: virtue and she</p>
<p>Is her own dower 766 , honour and wealth from me.</p>
<p>BERTRAM I cannot love her, nor will strive 767 to do’t</p>
<p>KING Thou wrong’st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose 768
.</p>
<p>HELEN That you are well restored 769 , my lord, I’m glad.</p>
<p>Let the rest go.</p>
<p>KING My honour’s at the stake 770 , which 771 to defeat,</p>
<p>I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,</p>
<p>Proud scornful boy, unworthy this 772 good gift,</p>
<p>That dost in vile misprision 773 shackle up</p>
<p>My love and her desert 774 . That 775 canst not dream,</p>
<p>We 776 , poising 777 us in her defective 778 scale,</p>
<p>Shall weigh thee to the beam 779 . That wilt not know,</p>
<p>It is in us 780 to plant thine honour where</p>
<p>We please to have it grow. Check 781 thy contempt:</p>
<p>Obey our will, which travails in 782 thy good.</p>
<p>Believe not 783 thy disdain, but presently 784</p>
<p>Do thine own fortunes that obedient right</p>
<p>Which both thy duty owes and our power claims,</p>
<p>Or I will throw thee from my care forever</p>
<p>Into the staggers 785 and the careless 786 lapse 787</p>
<p>Of youth and ignorance, both my revenge and hate</p>
<p>Loosing 788 upon thee, in the name of justice,</p>
<p>Without all terms 789 of pity. Speak. Thine answer.</p>
<p>BERTRAM Pardon, my gracious lord, for I submit</p>
<p>My fancy 790 to your eyes. When I consider</p>
<p>What great creation 791 and what dole 792 of honour</p>
<p>Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late 793</p>
<p>Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now</p>
<p>The praisèd of the king, who 794 , so ennobled,</p>
<p>Is as ’twere born so.</p>
<p>KING Take her by the hand,</p>
<p>And tell her she is thine, to whom I promise</p>
<p>A counterpoise 795 , if not 796 to thy estate,</p>
<p>A balance more replete 797 .</p>
<p>BERTRAM I take her hand.</p>
<p>KING Good fortune and the favour of the king</p>
<p>Smile upon this contract, whose ceremony</p>
<p>Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief 798 ,</p>
<p>And be performed tonight. The solemn feast</p>
<p>Shall more attend upon the coming space 799 ,</p>
<p>Expecting 800 absent friends. As 801 thou lov’st her,</p>
<p>Thy love’s to me religious 802 , else, does err 803 .</p>
<p>Exeunt. Parolles and Lafew stay behind commenting of this wedding</p>
<p>LAFEW Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Your pleasure, sir.</p>
<p>LAFEW Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Recantation? My lord? My master?</p>
<p>LAFEW Ay. Is it not a language I speak?</p>
<p>PAROLLES A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody
succeeding 804 . My master?</p>
<p>LAFEW Are you companion 805 to the Count Rossillion?</p>
<p>PAROLLES To any count, to all counts, to what is man 806 .</p>
<p>LAFEW To what is count’s man. Count’s master is of another style.</p>
<p>PAROLLES You are too old 807 , sir. Let it satisfy 808 you, you are
too old.</p>
<p>LAFEW I must tell thee, sirrah, I write 809 man, to which title age
cannot bring thee.</p>
<p>PAROLLES What I dare too well do 810 , I dare not do.</p>
<p>LAFEW I did think thee, for two ordinaries 811 , to be a pretty wise
fellow. Thou didst make tolerable vent 812 of thy travel, it might pass.
Yet the scarfs 813 and the bannerets 814 about thee did manifoldly
dissuade me from believing thee a vessel 815 of too great a burden 816 .
I have now found 817 thee 818 . When I lose thee again, I care not. Yet
art thou good for nothing but taking up 819 , and that thou’rt scarce
worth.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity 820 upon thee—</p>
<p>LAFEW Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy
trial 821 , which if—lord have mercy on thee for a hen 822 ! So, my good
window of lattice 823 , fare thee well. Thy casement 824 I need not
open, for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.</p>
<p>PAROLLES My lord, you give me most egregious 825 indignity.</p>
<p>LAFEW Ay, with all my heart, and thou art worthy of it.</p>
<p>PAROLLES I have not, my lord, deserved it.</p>
<p>LAFEW Yes, good faith, every dram 826 of it, and I will not bate 827
thee a scruple 828 .</p>
<p>PAROLLES Well, I shall be wiser 829 .</p>
<p>LAFEW Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack
o’th’contrary 830 . If ever thou be’st bound in thy scarf and beaten,
thou shall find what it is to be proud of thy bondage 831 . I have a
desire to hold 832 my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,
that I may say in the default 833 , he is a man I know 834 .</p>
<p>PAROLLES My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.</p>
<p>LAFEW I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing 835
eternal. For doing 836 I am past, as I will 837 by thee, in what motion
age will give me leave 838 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>PAROLLES Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me 839 ;
scurvy 840 , old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient. There is
no fettering 841 of authority. I’ll beat him, by my life, if I can meet
him with any convenience 842 , an 843 he were double and double a lord.
I’ll have no more pity of his age than I would have of— I’ll beat him,
an if I could but meet him again.</p>
<p>Enter Lafew</p>
<p>LAFEW Sirrah, your lord and master’s married. There’s news for you:
you have a new mistress.</p>
<p>PAROLLES I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some
reservation 844 of your wrongs 845 . He is my good lord 846 . Whom 847 I
serve above is my master.</p>
<p>LAFEW Who? God?</p>
<p>PAROLLES Ay, sir.</p>
<p>LAFEW The devil it is that’s thy master. Why dost thou garter 848 up
thy arms o’ this fashion? Dost make hose 849 of thy sleeves? Do other
servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands 850
. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I’d beat thee.
Methink’st thou art a general offence, and every man should beat thee. I
think thou wast created for men to breathe 851 themselves upon thee.</p>
<p>PAROLLES This is hard and undeserved measure 852 , my lord.</p>
<p>LAFEW Go to 853 , sir. You were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel
out of a pomegranate 854 . You are a vagabond 855 and no true 856
traveller. You are more saucy 857 with lords and honourable personages
than the commission 858 of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry 859
. You are not worth another word, else I’d call you knave. I leave
you.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>PAROLLES Good, very good, it is so then. Good, very good, let it be
concealed awhile.</p>
<p>Enter Count Rossillion [Bertram ]</p>
<p>BERTRAM Undone 860 , and forfeited to cares 861 forever!</p>
<p>PAROLLES What’s the matter, sweet heart?</p>
<p>BERTRAM Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,</p>
<p>I will not bed her.</p>
<p>PAROLLES What, what, sweetheart?</p>
<p>BERTRAM O my Parolles, they have married me!</p>
<p>I’ll to the Tuscan wars and never bed her.</p>
<p>PAROLLES France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits</p>
<p>The tread of a man’s foot: to th’wars!</p>
<p>BERTRAM There’s letters from my mother. What th’import 862 is, I know
not yet.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Ay, that would be known. To th’wars, my boy, to th’wars!</p>
<p>He wears his honour in a box 863 unseen</p>
<p>That hugs his kicky-wicky 864 here at home,</p>
<p>Spending 865 his manly marrow 866 in her arms,</p>
<p>Which should sustain the bound and high curvet 867</p>
<p>Of Mars’ fiery steed. To other regions,</p>
<p>France is a stable, we that dwell in’t jades 868 :</p>
<p>Therefore, to th’war!</p>
<p>BERTRAM It shall be so. I’ll send her to my house,</p>
<p>Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,</p>
<p>And wherefore I am fled, write to the king</p>
<p>That which I durst not speak. His present gift</p>
<p>Shall furnish me to 869 those Italian fields 870</p>
<p>Where noble fellows strike. War is no strife</p>
<p>To 871 the dark house 872 and the detested wife.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Will this capriccio 873 hold in thee? Art 874 sure?</p>
<p>BERTRAM Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.</p>
<p>I’ll send her straight 875 away. Tomorrow</p>
<p>I’ll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Why, these balls bound 876 , there’s noise in it. ’Tis
hard.</p>
<p>A young man married is a man that’s marred 877 :</p>
<p>Therefore away, and leave her bravely, go.</p>
<p>The king has done you wrong, but hush, ’tis so.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
