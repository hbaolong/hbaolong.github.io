<h4 id="introduction-to-the-life-of-timon-of-athens">Introduction to The
Life of Timon of Athens</h4>
<p>In thirty-seven of Shakespeare’s thirty-eight plays, there are
representations of family and sexual relationships – parents and
children, siblings, lovers, married couples, usually in multiple
combinations. The bonds of family and desire are the very DNA of his
dramatic world. Timon of Athens is the unique exception that proves the
rule. Nobody in the play has a blood relationship to anyone else. The
central character has no family and no lover.</p>
<p>The play seems to have been written around the time when Shakespeare
was creating his most demanding female roles – Lady Macbeth and
Cleopatra – and yet it almost entirely banishes women. Two whores have
walk-on parts in one scene, delivering forty words between them. Some
Amazons dance in a masque, though they may be intended as cross-dressed
men, like the masquers in Love’s Labour’s Lost and Henry VIII . There
are no children either: the boy-actors in Shakespeare’s company can
seldom have been so underemployed.</p>
<p>Cupid, the mischievous god of love, presides invisibly over all
Shakespeare’s comedies and several of his tragedies: Timon is the one
play in which he actually puts in an appearance, speaking the prologue
to the masque. But ironically, he has no part in the action. No
character in the play is struck by the dart of love. Cupidity, however –
the desire for money – is the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>‘In Timon of Athens’, wrote Karl Marx of his favourite play,
‘Shakespeare attributes two qualities to money. It is the visible deity,
the transformation of all human and natural qualities into their
opposites, the universal confusion and inversion of things; it brings
incompatibles into fraternity. And it is the universal whore, the
universal pander between men and nations.’ In simpler language: we
worship money, it distorts our view of what is important in life and it
turns all relationships into commercial exchanges. As Lucius’ servant
puts it, ‘Ay, and I think one business does command us all, / For mine
is money.’ No other Shakespearean play gives so much attention to
servants: by focusing on the master–servant relationship, as opposed to
parent–child or man–woman, Shakespeare and his co-author Thomas
Middleton (a master in both the comedy and the tragedy of commercial
exchange) bring home the Marxist point. Money as the universal whore:
that is the symbolic significance of having prostitutes as the only
female roles. It is also why the play begins with a selection of unnamed
characters selling their wares: jewels, silks for fine clothing, poems
and a painting.</p>
<p>The presence of a poet is especially interesting, in that it gives a
glimpse of Shakespeare’s conception of his own art. He knew from his
experience of dedicating his early poems to the Earl of Southampton what
was involved in the pursuit of patronage, and as a leading member of the
King’s Men he was a first-hand witness of the rush for favours in the
febrile atmosphere of the Jacobean court. The painter at the beginning
of Timon assumes that the poet is assiduously preparing ‘some work, some
dedication / To the great lord’, but the poet’s reply suggests that
Shakespeare conceived of his own art in terms of sprezzatura , the air
of seeming artlessness. It takes effort to strike fire from a flint,
whereas poetry may slip out ‘idly’ and ‘as a gum, which oozes / From
whence ’tis nourished.’</p>
<p>The opening scenes of the play offer a superb presentation of how
culture, both in classical times and Shakespeare’s, operates through an
elaborate system of ceremonies and rituals in which hospitality and
respect are key elements. The granting of favours and the lavishing of
gifts are equally essential to the system. Gift-giving was not a
spontaneous act of generosity (is it ever?): the custom was integral to
the network of social obligations and transactions in the early modern
period.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the position in which he commands respect, Timon
has to spend vast amounts of money throwing parties. As only the wise
steward Flavius perceives, the continuance of the show has exhausted his
master’s financial resources. On a smaller scale, Shakespeare himself
had probably witnessed a similar process in his youth when his father
reached a position of eminence in the community, but then overstretched
himself, borrowed money and ran into trouble because he could not pay
his debts. It is a familiar enough story, though in Timon of Athens the
scale of the wealth is inflated to an extreme and the spiral into
poverty is accompanied by a philosophical commentary.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Shakespeare is sceptical of the claims of
philosophy. He is more interested in how people behave in extreme
situations than in what they profess to believe. He only used the word
‘philosopher’ ten times in his complete works. Four of these usages are
in wry contexts in the comedies, while the other six are confined to two
tragedies, written in close proximity to each other early in the reign
of King James I. They are two tragedies which follow a similar pattern
of a man going from high to low estate, out from city or court to forest
or stormy place where there’s ‘scarce a bush’. In this ‘outside’ space,
the protagonist is filled with fury at his fellow humans. One of those
two plays is King Lear , the other is Timon of Athens . The resemblances
have often been observed.</p>
<p>VARRO’S SERVANT What is a whoremaster, fool?</p>
<p>FOOL A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. ’Tis a spirit:
sometime’t appears like a lord, sometime like a lawyer, sometime like a
philosopher with two stones more than’s artificial one. He is very often
like a knight; and generally in all shapes that man goes up and down in
from fourscore to thirteen, this spirit walks in.</p>
<p>VARRO’S SERVANT Thou art not altogether a fool.</p>
<p>A snatch of dialogue such as this could easily ‘change places and
handy-dandy’ with the voices of Lear and his Fool.</p>
<p>Jaques in As You Like It may fancy himself as a philosopher, but it
is in the cast of Timon of Athens that we meet the only professional
philosopher in Shakespeare: Apemantus. ‘I come to observe’, he says
during Timon’s first banquet, and he will remain to offer his tart
observations throughout the play. He is an extreme embodiment of the
philosophy embraced by Jaques: Cynicism. A Cynic takes Stoic rejection
of worldliness to an extreme; a Cynic, the saying had it, was a Stoic
without a tunic. The paradigm was the outspoken and shameless Diogenes,
who rejected ‘civilization’ and returned to the ‘natural’ life by
becoming a vagabond. Apemantus is ‘the philosopher’ in Shakespeare. Yet
for Apemantus, as for Jaques, Cynicism is a pose. They both actually
rather enjoy company and food. It is Timon who becomes the real
thing.</p>
<p>In Act 2, the Fool goes off with Apemantus, saying ‘I do not always
follow lover, elder brother and woman: sometime the philosopher.’ As on
many occasions in King Lear , a line spoken by the Fool is at a deeper
level applicable to the main character. Timon is the one who follows the
way of the philosopher instead of lover, brother or woman. ‘I am
Misanthropos, and hate mankind’, he will later announce. He becomes a
Diogenes, rejecting all possessions and all worldliness, dying in his
cave by the seashore.</p>
<p>The first half of the action is closed with a second banquet, in
which with studied irony Timon offers his guests nothing instead of
everything. Disgusted with mankind, he retreats to the woods. The
general Alcibiades goes into exile at the same time: the point seems to
be that both the military hero and the civic benefactor are victims of
the system’s ingratitude, scapegoats of Athenian political arrogance.
Like the exiled Coriolanus in another classical play written a couple of
years later, Alcibiades marches against the city that has mistreated
him. The Athenian senators respond by calling on Timon to perform the
role of the reconciler that Volumnia plays in Coriolanus ; he does so
indirectly by committing suicide, symbolically removing hatred from the
city and allowing Alcibiades to make peace with the state. The parallel
plot is, however, sketched briefly in rather than worked fully out.</p>
<p>The core of the play is the massive third scene of the fourth act in
which a succession of visitors comes to Timon in the forest, giving him
the opportunity to vent his misanthropy. There is an elegant symmetry
between the series of suitors seeking favours in the first half of the
play and the series of visitors gawping at Timon’s misfortunes in the
second. Among them is Apemantus, the professional philosopher. He has
dealt Timon a few home truths in the opening scene, along the lines of
‘He that loves to be flattered is worthy o’th’flatterer.’ Now he says,
‘The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the extremity of both
ends. When thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume, they mocked thee for
too much curiosity: in thy rags thou know’st none, but art despised for
the contrary.’ Athenian moral philosophy, embodied for the Renaissance
in the figure of Aristotle, extolled the virtues of the middle way, the
golden mean. Tragic drama is about people who will not follow that way,
who go instead to the extreme. Considered thus, Timon is the exemplary
tragic figure.</p>
<p>With its paucity of female characters and absence of familial bonds,
this will always remain one of Shakespeare’s least known, least loved
and least performed plays. Its exposure of our enslavement to money is
too close to the bone. Why would large numbers of people who have the
financial comfort that allows them to benefit from the public art form
of theatre want to spend an evening being beaten up on the subject? The
harsh beauty of Timon’s angry arias in the second half of the play, the
exemplary loyalty of the steward Flavius, the incisive wit of Apemantus
and the Fool: none of these are quite enough to compensate for the
absence of an amorous or heroic counter-voice. Perhaps it would have
been a different story if the character of Alcibiades had been more
fully developed. It is small wonder that critics have persistently
speculated – without any direct evidence – that the play was unfinished
or unperformed.</p>
<p>Yet for intellectual muscle, the second half of the play is as
powerful as anything in Shakespeare. It directly addresses one of the
great questions in both his time and ours: the relationship between
culture and nature. The home that Timon leaves and excoriates is the
city of Athens, the birthplace of democracy, philosophy and theatre, the
epitome of culture. When he goes into the woods, he is returning from
culture to nature, reversing the process by which human cultural
evolution has led to ever-greater alienation from our environmental
origins. Initially, the angry exile believes that the order of nature is
no different from that of the city he has left. He perceives natural
forces to be in the same kind of relationship of exchange and deception
as those of human society:</p>
<p>The sun’s a thief, and with his great attraction</p>
<p>Robs the vast sea: the moon’s an arrant thief,</p>
<p>And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:</p>
<p>The sea’s a thief, whose liquid surge resolves</p>
<p>The moon into salt tears: the earth’s a thief,</p>
<p>That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen</p>
<p>From gen’ral excrement: each thing’s a thief.</p>
<p>And he blames the earth for yielding up the precious metal which is
the origin of that commodity which is the root of all evil.</p>
<p>But in his downward spiral, Timon also makes a kind of spiritual
ascent. His trajectory is not after all so very different from that of
Antony and Cleopatra in the subsequent play that Shakespeare based on
the same source in classical literature. Throwing away the gold, he
finds peace in the imminence of death: ‘My long sickness / Of health and
living now begins to mend, / And nothing brings me all things.’ He makes
‘his everlasting mansion / Upon the beachèd verge of the salt flood.’
His road from fickle worldly prosperity to the nothingness of death goes
via the wood and peters out at the edge of the sea. The
nineteenth-century critic William Hazlitt suggested that Timon ends by
‘seeking in the everlasting solemnities of nature oblivion from the
transitory splendour of his lifetime’.</p>
<p>Though the play is couched in the ancient ascetic language of
contemptus mundi , there was for Hazlitt, and there should be for us,
something profoundly enduring about the image of a human soul
contemplating the vastness of the ocean and being brought to the
realization that money is not everything and indeed that nothing may
bring all things. Like King Lear and his godson Edgar, Timon is one of a
tiny handful of tragic characters who are brought to a place that we
might call ground zero. The difference between the two plays is that in
Lear the meaning of love is discovered amidst the apocalypse, whereas in
Timon a man dies alone, without any community save that of the elements
of earth, sea and sky.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>AUTHORSHIP: Long considered to be an incomplete Shakespearean work,
Timon of Athens has been shown by modern scholarship to be, in all
probability, a collaboration between Shakespeare and THOMAS MIDDLETON ,
with the following likely distribution of scenes:</p>
<p>1.1 Shakespeare, perhaps with some brief additions by Middleton</p>
<p>1.2 Middleton</p>
<p>2.1 Shakespeare</p>
<p>2.2 mixed authorship</p>
<p>3.1–3.6 Middleton</p>
<p>3.7 mixed (beginning and end by Middleton, middle by
Shakespeare?)</p>
<p>4.1 Shakespeare</p>
<p>4.2 mixed authorship?</p>
<p>4.3–5.1 Shakespeare, with some Middleton additions (especially to the
encounter between Timon and Flavius)</p>
<p>5.2–5.4 Shakespeare</p>
<p>PLOT: Timon, a rich Athenian, is famous for his liberality. As the
play opens a group of people is gathering outside Timon’s house, waiting
to offer him flattering gifts or beg favours. There is much talk of his
generosity and open-heartedness, which is immediately borne out when he
appears, paying a friend’s debts to free him from prison and giving
money to a servant to allow him to marry. Only the cynical philosopher
Apemantus has doubts about the sincerity of Timon’s friends. The young
general Alcibiades is warmly welcomed by Timon, who invites him and
other friends to a banquet, at which there is more lavish distribution
of gifts. However, Timon’s steward Flavius realizes what his master
doesn’t – that Timon’s extravagant lifestyle has emptied his coffers.
Timon’s creditors start to ask for payment and one after another he asks
his friends for help, only to be refused by all. He invites them all to
a second banquet, where he turns the tables on them. Alcibiades pleads
in vain with the senate for the life of one of his soldiers who has
committed a murder; in anger they banish him from Athens. The
disillusioned Timon goes to live as a recluse outside Athens, railing
bitterly against mankind. One day, digging for roots to eat, he
discovers gold. He gives it away, first to Alcibiades, to pay the army
he has raised against Athens, and his two whores, Timandra and Phrynia,
then to some bandits. He finally offers some to his steward Flavius.
Hearing of this, more false friends come out to flatter Timon but he
drives them away, along with the senators from Athens who come to beg
for his help against Alcibiades. Alcibiades wins his war against the
Athenian senators, at which point news reaches the city that Timon is
dead.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Timon (34％/210/8), Apemantus (10％/100/4), Flavius (8％/41/6),
Alcibiades (7％/39/5), Poet (4％/30/2), First Senator (4％/27/4),
Painter (3％/30/2), Second Senator (3％/14/4), Lucilius (2％/13/2).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 75％ verse, 25％ prose.</p>
<p>DATE: 1604–06? No firm evidence for date, but stylistic similarity
suggests proximity to King Lear and Middleton’s A Trick to Catch the Old
One (1605); this was the period when Middleton was writing for the
King’s Men, so is likeliest for a collaboration. The shared source with
Antony and Cleopatra (see below) supports such a date. The masque and
the concern with flatterers are more Jacobean than Elizabethan
(i.e. after the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603); the absence of a
clear five-act structure implies composition before the King’s Men began
playing the indoor Blackfriars theatre (i.e. before 1608).</p>
<p>SOURCES: There is a general outline of the Timon story in Plutarch’s
‘Life of Marcus Antonius’, which was Shakespeare’s main source for
Antony and Cleopatra ; Plutarch’s Lives of the Most Noble Grecians and
Romanes also included a biography of Alcibiades, providing material for
the sub-plot. The other major source is a dialogue on Timon by the
second-century Greek satirist Lucian of Samosata (probably in the 1528
Latin translation by Erasmus). There are close resemblances, especially
in the second banquet scene, to an anonymous university or Inns of Court
comedy of Timon , which may be a source. It is possible that Shakespeare
worked from Plutarch while Middleton brought knowledge of the academic
play and Lucian. The character of Apemantus may also be indebted to the
misanthropic philosopher Diogenes in John Lyly’s comedy Campaspe
(1581).</p>
<p>TEXT: The relative brevity of the play and a plethora of internal
inconsistencies, such as the interview between Flavius and Ventidius
that is arranged at the end of Act 2 scene 2 but never materializes, led
to the hypothesis that Timon was an incomplete work. Co-authorship is
now considered a much likelier explanation for the textual problems.
Most scholars believe that the copy was set from the dramatists’ rough
draft; though this is not known for certain, most of the difficulties
are attributable to problems with the copy rather than the quality of
the printers’ work.</p>
