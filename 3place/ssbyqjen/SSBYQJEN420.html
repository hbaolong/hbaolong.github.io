<h4 id="scene-2-456-running-scene-4">Scene 2 456 / running scene 4</h4>
<p>Enter Steward [Flavius ], with many bills in his hand</p>
<p>FLAVIUS No care, no stop: so senseless of expense</p>
<p>That he will neither know 457 how to maintain 458 it,</p>
<p>Nor cease his flow of riot 459 , 460 takes no account</p>
<p>How things go from him, nor resume no care</p>
<p>Of what is to continue 461 . Never mind</p>
<p>Was to be so unwise, to be so kind 462 .</p>
<p>What shall be done? He will not hear, till feel 463 .</p>
<p>I must be round 464 with him, now he comes from hunting.</p>
<p>Fie, fie, fie, fie!</p>
<p>Enter Caphis, [meeting Servants of ] Isidore and Varro</p>
<p>CAPHIS Good even, Varro. What, you come for money?</p>
<p>VARRO’S SERVANT Is’t not your business too?</p>
<p>CAPHIS It is: and yours too, Isidore?</p>
<p>ISIDORE’S SERVANT It is so.</p>
<p>CAPHIS Would we were all discharged 465 !</p>
<p>VARRO’S SERVANT I fear it 466 .</p>
<p>CAPHIS Here comes the lord.</p>
<p>Enter Timon and his train 467 [including Alcibiades ]</p>
<p>TIMON So soon as dinner’s done, we’ll forth 468 again,</p>
<p>My Alcibiades.— With me? What is your will?</p>
<p>To Caphis</p>
<p>CAPHIS My lord, here is a note of certain dues 469 .</p>
<p>Gives a bill</p>
<p>TIMON Dues? Whence are you? 470</p>
<p>CAPHIS Of Athens here, my lord.</p>
<p>TIMON Go to my steward.</p>
<p>CAPHIS Please it your lordship, he hath put me off</p>
<p>To the succession of new days this month 471 :</p>
<p>My master is awaked by great occasion 472</p>
<p>To call upon his own 473 , and humbly prays you</p>
<p>That with your other noble parts you’ll suit 474</p>
<p>In giving him his right.</p>
<p>TIMON Mine honest friend,</p>
<p>I prithee but repair 475 to me next morning.</p>
<p>CAPHIS Nay, good my lord—</p>
<p>TIMON Contain thyself, good friend.</p>
<p>VARRO’S SERVANT One Varro’s servant, my good lord—</p>
<p>ISIDORE’S SERVANT From Isidore:</p>
<p>He humbly prays your speedy payment.</p>
<p>CAPHIS If you did know, my lord, my master’s wants 476 —</p>
<p>VARRO’S SERVANT ’Twas due on forfeiture 477 , my lord, six weeks and
past.</p>
<p>ISIDORE’S SERVANT Your steward puts me off, my lord, and I</p>
<p>Am sent expressly to your lordship.</p>
<p>TIMON Give me breath 478 .—</p>
<p>I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on 479 :</p>
<p>To his train</p>
<p>I’ll wait upon 480 you instantly.—</p>
<p>[Exeunt Alcibiades and Lords ]</p>
<p>Come hither. Pray you,</p>
<p>To Flavius</p>
<p>How goes 481 the world that I am thus encountered 482</p>
<p>With clamorous demands 483 of broken bonds</p>
<p>And the detention 484 of long-since-due debts,</p>
<p>Against my honour 485 ?</p>
<p>FLAVIUS Please you, gentlemen,</p>
<p>To Servants</p>
<p>The time is unagreeable to 486 this business:</p>
<p>Your importunacy cease till after dinner,</p>
<p>That I may make his lordship understand</p>
<p>Wherefore you are not paid.</p>
<p>TIMON Do so, my friends.—</p>
<p>To Servants</p>
<p>See them well entertained.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>To Flavius</p>
<p>FLAVIUS Pray, draw near 487 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>The Servants start</p>
<p>Enter Apemantus and Fool 488</p>
<p>to follow</p>
<p>CAPHIS Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus: let’s ha’ some
sport with ’em.</p>
<p>VARRO’S SERVANT Hang him, he’ll abuse us.</p>
<p>ISIDORE’S SERVANT A plague upon him, dog!</p>
<p>VARRO’S SERVANT How dost 489 , fool?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Dost dialogue with 490 thy shadow 491 ? 492</p>
<p>VARRO’S SERVANT I speak not to thee.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS No,’tis to thyself.— Come away.</p>
<p>To Fool</p>
<p>ISIDORE’S SERVANT There’s the fool hangs on your back 493
already.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS No, thou stand’st single 494 : thou’rt not on him yet.</p>
<p>CAPHIS Where’s the fool now?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS He 495 last asked the question. Poor rogues and usurers 496
’ men, bawds 497 between gold and want 498 .</p>
<p>ALL SERVANTS What are we, Apemantus?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Asses.</p>
<p>ALL SERVANTS Why?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS That you ask me what you are, and do not know yourselves.
Speak to ’em, fool.</p>
<p>FOOL How do you, gentlemen?</p>
<p>ALL SERVANTS Gramercies 499 , good fool. How does your mistress?</p>
<p>FOOL She’s e’en 500 setting on 501 water to scald 502 such chickens
as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth 503 !</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Good, gramercy.</p>
<p>Enter Page</p>
<p>FOOL Look you, here comes my master’s page.</p>
<p>PAGE Why, how now, captain? What do you in this wise company?— How
dost thou, Apemantus?</p>
<p>To the Fool</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Would I had a rod 504 in my mouth, that I might answer 505
thee profitably.</p>
<p>PAGE Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription 506 of these
letters: I know not which is which.</p>
<p>Gives letters</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Canst not read?</p>
<p>PAGE No.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS There will little learning die then, that day thou art
hanged. This is to Lord Timon, this to Alcibiades. Go, thou wast born a
bastard, and thou’lt die a bawd.</p>
<p>PAGE Thou wast whelped 507 a dog, and thou shalt famish 508 a dog’s
death. Answer not, I am gone.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>APEMANTUS E’en so thou outrunn’st grace 509 .—</p>
<p>Fool, I will go with you to Lord Timon’s.</p>
<p>FOOL Will you leave me there?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS If Timon stay at home 510 .— You three serve three
usurers?</p>
<p>To Servants</p>
<p>ALL SERVANTS Ay: would 511 they served 512 us!</p>
<p>APEMANTUS So would I: as good a trick as ever hangman served
thief.</p>
<p>FOOL Are you three usurers’ men?</p>
<p>ALL SERVANTS Ay, fool.</p>
<p>FOOL I think no usurer but has a fool to 513 his servant: my mistress
is one 514 , and I am her fool 515 . When men come to borrow of your
masters, they approach sadly 516 and go away merry, but they enter my
master’s house merrily and go away sadly: the reason of this?</p>
<p>VARRO’S SERVANT I could render 517 one.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster 518 and
a knave, which notwithstanding thou shalt be no less esteemed 519 .</p>
<p>VARRO’S SERVANT What is a whoremaster, fool?</p>
<p>FOOL A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. ’Tis a spirit:
sometime’t appears like a lord, sometime like a lawyer, sometime like a
philosopher with two stones 520 more than’s artificial one 521 . He is
very often like a knight; and generally in all shapes that man goes up
and down 522 in from fourscore 523 to thirteen, this spirit walks
in.</p>
<p>VARRO’S SERVANT Thou art not altogether a fool.</p>
<p>FOOL Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as I have, so
much wit thou lack’st.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS That answer might have become 524 Apemantus.</p>
<p>ALL SERVANTS Aside, aside, here comes Lord Timon.</p>
<p>Enter Timon and Steward</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Come with me, fool, come.</p>
<p>FOOL I do not always follow lover, elder brother and woman 525 :
sometime the philosopher.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Apemantus and Fool ]</p>
<p>FLAVIUS Pray you walk near 526 : I’ll speak with you anon.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Servants ]</p>
<p>TIMON You make me marvel 527 wherefore ere this time</p>
<p>Had you not fully laid my state before me,</p>
<p>That I might so have rated my expense</p>
<p>As I had leave of means 528 ?</p>
<p>FLAVIUS You would not hear me:</p>
<p>At many leisures 529 I proposed 530 .</p>
<p>TIMON Go to 531 :</p>
<p>Perchance 532 some single 533 vantages 534 you took</p>
<p>When my indisposition 535 put you back 536 ,</p>
<p>And that unaptness made your minister 537</p>
<p>Thus to excuse yourself.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS O my good lord,</p>
<p>At many times I brought in my accounts,</p>
<p>Laid them before you: you would throw them off,</p>
<p>And say, you found them in mine honesty 538 .</p>
<p>When for some trifling present you have bid me</p>
<p>Return so much, I have shook my head and wept:</p>
<p>Yea, gainst th’authority of manners 539 prayed you</p>
<p>To hold your hand more close 540 . I did endure</p>
<p>Not seldom, nor no slight checks 541 when I have</p>
<p>Prompted you in 542 the ebb of your estate</p>
<p>And your great flow of debts. My lovèd lord,</p>
<p>Though you hear now too late, yet now’s a time 543 :</p>
<p>The greatest of your having lacks a half 544</p>
<p>To pay your present debts.</p>
<p>TIMON Let all my land be sold.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS ’Tis all engaged 545 , some forfeited and gone,</p>
<p>And what remains will hardly stop 546 the mouth</p>
<p>Of present dues 547 . The future comes apace 548 interim : 549</p>
<p>What shall defend the interim, and at length 550</p>
<p>How goes our reck’ning 551 ?</p>
<p>TIMON To Lacedaemon 552 did my land extend.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS O, my good lord, the world is but a word:</p>
<p>Were it all yours to give it in a breath,</p>
<p>How quickly were it gone!</p>
<p>TIMON You tell me true.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS If you suspect my husbandry 553 or falsehood 554 ,</p>
<p>Call me before th’exactest auditors 555</p>
<p>And set me on the proof 556 . So the gods bless me,</p>
<p>When all our offices 557 have been oppressed 558</p>
<p>With riotous feeders 559 , when our vaults 560 have wept</p>
<p>With drunken spilth 561 of wine, when every room</p>
<p>Hath blazed with lights and brayed with minstrelsy 562 ,</p>
<p>I have retired me to a wasteful cock 563 ,</p>
<p>And set mine eyes at flow 564 .</p>
<p>TIMON Prithee, no more.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!</p>
<p>How many prodigal bits 565 have slaves 566 and peasants</p>
<p>This night englutted 567 ! Who is not Timon’s 568 ?</p>
<p>What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is</p>
<p>Lord Timon’s?</p>
<p>Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!</p>
<p>Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,</p>
<p>The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:</p>
<p>Feast-won, fast-lost 569 ; one cloud of winter show’rs,</p>
<p>These flies are couched 570 .</p>
<p>TIMON Come, sermon 571 me no further:</p>
<p>No villainous 572 bounty yet hath passed my heart;</p>
<p>Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.</p>
<p>Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience 573 lack,</p>
<p>To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart:</p>
<p>If I would broach 574 the vessels of my love</p>
<p>And try 575 the argument of hearts 576 by borrowing,</p>
<p>Men and men’s fortunes could I frankly 577 use</p>
<p>As I can bid thee speak.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS Assurance bless your thoughts 578 !</p>
<p>TIMON And in some sort 579 these wants of mine are crowned 580</p>
<p>That I account 581 them blessings, for by these</p>
<p>Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you</p>
<p>Mistake my fortunes. I am wealthy in my friends.—</p>
<p>Within there, Flaminius, Servilius!</p>
<p>Calls</p>
<p>Enter three Servants</p>
<p>SERVANTS My lord, my lord.</p>
<p>TIMON I will dispatch you severally 582 : you to Lord Lucius,—</p>
<p>To Servilius</p>
<p>to Lord Lucullus you — I hunted with his honour today—</p>
<p>To Flaminius</p>
<p>you to Sempronius. Commend me to their loves, and I am proud, say,
that my occasions 583 have found time 584 to use ’em toward 585 a supply
of money: let the request be fifty talents.</p>
<p>To Third Servant</p>
<p>FLAMINIUS As you have said, my lord.</p>
<p>[Exeunt the Servants ]</p>
<p>FLAVIUS Lord Lucius and Lucullus? Hum! 586</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>TIMON Go you, sir, to the senators —</p>
<p>Of whom, even to the state’s best health 587 , I have</p>
<p>Deserved this hearing — bid ’em send o’th’instant</p>
<p>A thousand talents to me.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS I have been bold —</p>
<p>For that 588 I knew it the most general 589 way —</p>
<p>To them to use your signet 590 and your name,</p>
<p>But they do shake their heads, and I am here</p>
<p>No richer in return.</p>
<p>TIMON Is’t true? Can’t be?</p>
<p>FLAVIUS They answer in a joint and corporate 591 voice</p>
<p>That now they are at fall 592 , want 593 treasure, cannot</p>
<p>Do what they would, are sorry, you are honourable,</p>
<p>But yet they could have wished — they know not —</p>
<p>Something hath been amiss, a noble nature</p>
<p>May catch a wrench 594 — would all were well — ’tis pity.</p>
<p>And so, intending 595 other serious matters,</p>
<p>After distasteful looks and these hard fractions 596 ,</p>
<p>With certain half-caps 597 and cold-moving 598 nods</p>
<p>They froze me into silence.</p>
<p>TIMON You gods reward them!</p>
<p>Prithee, man, look cheerly 599 . These old fellows</p>
<p>Have their ingratitude in them hereditary 600 :</p>
<p>Their blood is caked 601 , ’tis cold, it seldom flows:</p>
<p>’Tis 602 lack of kindly 603 warmth they are not kind;</p>
<p>And nature, as it grows again toward earth 604 ,</p>
<p>Is fashioned for the journey, dull 605 and heavy.—</p>
<p>Go to Ventidius.— Prithee be not sad:</p>
<p>To a Servant/To Flavius</p>
<p>Thou art true and honest; ingeniously 606 I speak.</p>
<p>No blame belongs to thee.— Ventidius lately</p>
<p>To Servant</p>
<p>Buried his father, by whose death he’s stepped</p>
<p>Into 607 a great estate: when he was poor,</p>
<p>Imprisoned and in scarcity of friends,</p>
<p>I cleared him with five talents. Greet him from me,</p>
<p>Bid him suppose some good necessity 608</p>
<p>Touches his friend, which craves to be remembered</p>
<p>With those five talents.—</p>
<p>[Exit Servant ]</p>
<p>That had, give’t these fellows</p>
<p>To Flavius</p>
<p>To whom ’tis instant due. Ne’er speak or think</p>
<p>That Timon’s fortunes ’mong his friends can sink.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS I would I could not think it: that thought is bounty’s foe
609 ;</p>
<p>Being free 610 itself, it thinks all others so.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
