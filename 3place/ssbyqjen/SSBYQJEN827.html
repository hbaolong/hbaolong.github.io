<p>Alarum 2 . Enter Plantagenet, [the Duke of York, ] Edward, Richard,
Norfolk, Montague, Warwick [with white roses 3 in their hats, ] and
Soldiers</p>
<p>WARWICK I wonder how the king escaped our hands.</p>
<p>YORK While we pursued the horsemen of the north,</p>
<p>He slyly stole away and left his men:</p>
<p>Whereat the great lord of Northumberland,</p>
<p>Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat 4 ,</p>
<p>Cheered up the drooping 5 army, and himself,</p>
<p>Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,</p>
<p>Charged our main battle’s 6 front, and breaking in,</p>
<p>Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.</p>
<p>EDWARD Lord Stafford’s father, Duke of Buckingham,</p>
<p>Is either slain or wounded dangerous 7 .</p>
<p>I cleft 8 his beaver 9 with a downright 10 blow.</p>
<p>That this is true, father, behold his blood.</p>
<p>MONTAGUE And, brother 11 , here’s the Earl of Wiltshire’s blood,</p>
<p>Whom I encountered 12 as the battles joined.</p>
<p>RICHARD Speak thou 13 for me and tell them what I did.</p>
<p>Shows Somerset’s head</p>
<p>YORK Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.—</p>
<p>But is your grace dead, my lord of Somerset?</p>
<p>NORFOLK Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt 14 .</p>
<p>RICHARD Thus do I hope to shake King Henry’s head.</p>
<p>WARWICK And so do I.— Victorious Prince of York,</p>
<p>Before 15 I see thee seated in that throne</p>
<p>Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,</p>
<p>I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.</p>
<p>This is the palace of the fearful 16 king,</p>
<p>And this the regal seat: possess 17 it, York,</p>
<p>For this is thine and not King Henry’s heirs’.</p>
<p>YORK Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will,</p>
<p>For hither we have broken in by force.</p>
<p>NORFOLK We’ll all assist you, he that flies shall die.</p>
<p>YORK Thanks, gentle 18 Norfolk.— Stay by me, my lords,</p>
<p>And soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.</p>
<p>They go up [to the throne ]</p>
<p>WARWICK And when the king comes, offer 19 him no violence,</p>
<p>Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce 20 .</p>
<p>YORK The queen this day here holds her parliament,</p>
<p>But little thinks we shall be of her council.</p>
<p>By words or blows here let us win our right.</p>
<p>RICHARD Armed as we are, let’s stay within this house.</p>
<p>WARWICK The bloody parliament shall this be called,</p>
<p>Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,</p>
<p>And bashful 21 Henry deposed, whose cowardice</p>
<p>Hath made us bywords 22 to our enemies.</p>
<p>YORK Then leave me not, my lords: be resolute.</p>
<p>I mean to take possession of my right.</p>
<p>WARWICK Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,</p>
<p>The proudest he that holds up 23 Lancaster,</p>
<p>Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells 24 .</p>
<p>I’ll plant 25 Plantagenet, root him up who dares.</p>
<p>Resolve thee, Richard: claim the English crown.</p>
<p>Flourish 26 . Enter King Henry, Clifford, Northumberland,
Westmorland, Exeter [with red roses 27 in their hats, ] and the rest</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI My lords, look where the sturdy 28 rebel sits,</p>
<p>Even in the chair of state 29 : belike 30 he means,</p>
<p>Backed by the power of Warwick, that false peer 31 ,</p>
<p>To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.</p>
<p>Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father,</p>
<p>And thine, Lord Clifford, and you both have vowed revenge</p>
<p>On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND If I be not 32 , heavens be revenged on me!</p>
<p>CLIFFORD The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel 33 .</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND What, shall we suffer 34 this? Let’s pluck him down.</p>
<p>My heart for anger burns. I cannot brook 35 it.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmorland.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Patience is for poltroons 36 , such as he.</p>
<p>He durst not 37 sit there had your father lived.</p>
<p>My gracious lord, here in the parliament</p>
<p>Let us assail 38 the family of York.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Well hast thou spoken, cousin 39 : be it so.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Ah, know you not the city 40 favours them,</p>
<p>And they have troops of soldiers at their beck 41 ?</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND But when the duke is slain, they’ll quickly fly.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Far be the thought of this from Henry’s heart,</p>
<p>To make a shambles 42 of the parliament house.—</p>
<p>Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats</p>
<p>Shall be the war that Henry means to use.—</p>
<p>Thou factious 43 Duke of York, descend my throne,</p>
<p>And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet.</p>
<p>I am thy sovereign.</p>
<p>YORK I am thine.</p>
<p>EXETER For shame, come down. He made thee Duke of York 44 .</p>
<p>YORK It was my inheritance, as the earldom 45 was.</p>
<p>EXETER Thy father was a traitor to the crown 46 .</p>
<p>WARWICK Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown</p>
<p>In following this usurping Henry.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Whom should he follow but his natural king?</p>
<p>WARWICK True, Clifford, that’s Richard Duke of York.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?</p>
<p>YORK It must and shall be so. Content thyself 47 .</p>
<p>WARWICK Be Duke of Lancaster, let him be king.</p>
<p>To King Henry</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND He is both king and Duke of Lancaster,</p>
<p>And that the Lord of Westmorland shall maintain 48 .</p>
<p>WARWICK And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget</p>
<p>That we are those which chased you from the field 49</p>
<p>And slew your fathers, and with colours 50 spread</p>
<p>Marched through the city to the palace gates.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief.</p>
<p>And by his 51 soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,</p>
<p>Thy kinsmen and thy friends, I’ll have more lives</p>
<p>Than drops of blood were in my father’s veins.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Urge 52 it no more, lest that instead of words,</p>
<p>I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger 53</p>
<p>As shall revenge his death before I stir.</p>
<p>WARWICK Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats.</p>
<p>YORK Will you we 54 show our title to the crown?</p>
<p>If not, our swords shall plead 55 it in the field.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?</p>
<p>Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York 56 :</p>
<p>Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:</p>
<p>I am the son of Henry the Fifth,</p>
<p>Who made the dauphin 57 and the French to stoop 58</p>
<p>And seized upon their towns and provinces.</p>
<p>WARWICK Talk not of France, sith 59 thou hast lost it all.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI The Lord Protector 60 lost it and not I:</p>
<p>When I was crowned, I was but nine months old.</p>
<p>RICHARD You are old enough now, and yet 61 , methinks, you lose.—</p>
<p>Father, tear the crown from the usurper’s head.</p>
<p>EDWARD Sweet father, do so, set it on your head.</p>
<p>MONTAGUE Good brother, as thou lov’st and honourest arms,</p>
<p>Let’s fight it out and not stand cavilling 62 thus.</p>
<p>RICHARD Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.</p>
<p>YORK Sons, peace!</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Peace, thou, and give King Henry leave 63 to speak.</p>
<p>WARWICK Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords,</p>
<p>And be you silent and attentive too,</p>
<p>For he that interrupts him shall not live.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Think’st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,</p>
<p>Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?</p>
<p>No: first shall war unpeople 64 this my realm;</p>
<p>Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,</p>
<p>And now in England to our heart’s great sorrow,</p>
<p>Shall be my winding-sheet 65 . Why faint you 66 , lords?</p>
<p>My title’s good, and better far than his.</p>
<p>WARWICK Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.</p>
<p>YORK ’Twas by rebellion against his king 67 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI I know not what to say, my title’s weak.—</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?</p>
<p>YORK What then?</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI An if 68 he may, then am I lawful king,</p>
<p>For Richard, in the view of many lords,</p>
<p>Resigned the crown to Henry the Fourth,</p>
<p>Whose heir my father was, and I am his.</p>
<p>YORK He rose against him, being 69 his sovereign,</p>
<p>And made him to resign his crown perforce.</p>
<p>WARWICK Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrained 70 ,</p>
<p>Think you ’twere prejudicial to his crown 71 ?</p>
<p>EXETER No, for he could not so resign his crown,</p>
<p>But that the next heir 72 should succeed and reign.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?</p>
<p>EXETER His 73 is the right, and therefore pardon me.</p>
<p>YORK Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?</p>
<p>EXETER My conscience tells me he is lawful king.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI All will revolt from me and turn to him.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay’st,</p>
<p>To York</p>
<p>Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.</p>
<p>WARWICK Deposed he shall be, in despite 74 of all.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Thou art deceived 75 . ’Tis not thy southern power 76
,</p>
<p>Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,</p>
<p>Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,</p>
<p>Can set the duke up 77 in despite of me.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,</p>
<p>Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:</p>
<p>May that ground gape and swallow me alive,</p>
<p>Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!</p>
<p>YORK Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.</p>
<p>What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?</p>
<p>WARWICK Do right unto this princely Duke of York,</p>
<p>Or I will fill the house with armèd men,</p>
<p>And over the chair of state, where now he sits,</p>
<p>Write up his title with usurping blood 78 .</p>
<p>He stamps with his foot and the Soldiers show themselves</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI My lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:</p>
<p>Let me for this my lifetime reign as king.</p>
<p>YORK Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,</p>
<p>And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv’st.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI I am content. Richard Plantagenet,</p>
<p>Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD What wrong is this unto the prince your son!</p>
<p>WARWICK What good is this to England and himself!</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Base 79 , fearful and despairing Henry!</p>
<p>CLIFFORD How hast thou injured both thyself and us!</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND I cannot stay to hear these articles 80 .</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Nor I.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.</p>
<p>To Northumberland</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,</p>
<p>In whose cold 81 blood no spark of honour bides.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Be thou a prey unto the House of York,</p>
<p>And die in bands 82 for this unmanly deed.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,</p>
<p>Or live in peace abandoned and despised.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Northumberland, Clifford and Westmorland ]</p>
<p>WARWICK Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.</p>
<p>EXETER They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Ah, Exeter.</p>
<p>WARWICK Why should you sigh, my lord?</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,</p>
<p>Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.</p>
<p>But be it as it may.— I here entail 83</p>
<p>To York</p>
<p>The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever,</p>
<p>Conditionally 84 , that here thou take an oath</p>
<p>To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,</p>
<p>To honour me as thy king and sovereign,</p>
<p>And neither by treason nor hostility</p>
<p>To seek to put me down 85 and reign thyself.</p>
<p>YORK This oath I willingly take and will perform.</p>
<p>WARWICK Long live King Henry!— Plantagenet embrace him.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI And long live thou and these thy forward 86 sons!</p>
<p>YORK Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.</p>
<p>EXETER Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes.</p>
<p>Sennet 87 . Here they come down 88</p>
<p>YORK Farewell, my gracious lord, I’ll to my castle.</p>
<p>[Exeunt York, his sons and their Soldiers ]</p>
<p>WARWICK And I’ll keep 89 London with my soldiers.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>NORFOLK And I to Norfolk with my followers.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>MONTAGUE And I unto the sea 90 from whence I came.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI And I with grief and sorrow to the court.</p>
<p>Enter the Queen [Margaret, with Prince Edward ]</p>
<p>EXETER Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray 91 her anger.</p>
<p>I’ll steal away.</p>
<p>Starts to leave</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Exeter, so will I.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Nay, go not from me, I will follow thee.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Who can be patient in such extremes?</p>
<p>Ah, wretched man, would 92 I had died a maid 93</p>
<p>And never seen thee, never borne thee son,</p>
<p>Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father.</p>
<p>Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?</p>
<p>Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,</p>
<p>Or felt that pain 94 which I did for him once,</p>
<p>Or nourished him as I did with my blood 95 ,</p>
<p>Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,</p>
<p>Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir</p>
<p>And disinherited thine only son.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD Father, you cannot disinherit me:</p>
<p>If you be king, why should not I succeed?</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Pardon me, Margaret.— Pardon me, sweet son.</p>
<p>The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Enforced thee? Art thou king, and wilt be forced?</p>
<p>I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch,</p>
<p>Thou hast undone 96 thyself, thy son and me,</p>
<p>And given unto the House of York such head 97</p>
<p>As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance 98 .</p>
<p>To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,</p>
<p>What is it, but to make thy sepulchre 99</p>
<p>And creep into it far before thy time?</p>
<p>Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais,</p>
<p>Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas 100 ,</p>
<p>The duke 101 is made protector of the realm,</p>
<p>And yet shalt thou be safe? Such safety finds</p>
<p>The trembling lamb environèd 102 with wolves.</p>
<p>Had I been there, which am a silly 103 woman,</p>
<p>The soldiers should have tossed 104 me on their pikes 105</p>
<p>Before I would have granted 106 to that act.</p>
<p>But thou preferr’st thy life before thine honour.</p>
<p>And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself</p>
<p>Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed 107 ,</p>
<p>Until that act of parliament be repealed</p>
<p>Whereby my son is disinherited.</p>
<p>The northern lords that have forsworn 108 thy colours</p>
<p>Will follow mine, if once they see them spread:</p>
<p>And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace</p>
<p>And utter ruin of the House of York.</p>
<p>Thus do I leave thee.— Come, son, let’s away.</p>
<p>Our army is ready; come, we’ll after them.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Thou hast spoke too much already. Get thee gone.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Ay, to be murdered by his enemies.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD When I return with victory from the field</p>
<p>I’ll see your grace: till then I’ll follow her.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Come, son, away. We may not linger thus.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Queen Margaret and Prince Edward ]</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Poor queen, how love to me and to her son</p>
<p>Hath made her break out into terms of rage.</p>
<p>Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,</p>
<p>Whose haughty spirit, wingèd with desire,</p>
<p>Will cost 109 my crown, and like an empty 110 eagle</p>
<p>Tire 111 on the flesh of me and of my son.</p>
<p>The loss of those three lords torments my heart:</p>
<p>I’ll write unto them and entreat them fair 112 .</p>
<p>Come, cousin you shall be the messenger.</p>
<p>EXETER And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt</p>
