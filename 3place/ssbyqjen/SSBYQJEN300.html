<h4 id="scene-4-running-scene-11">Scene 4 / running scene 11</h4>
<p>Enter Florizel [wearing shepherd’s clothing, and ] Perdita</p>
<p>FLORIZEL These your unusual weeds 905 to each part of you</p>
<p>Does give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora 906</p>
<p>Peering in April’s front 907 . This your sheep-shearing</p>
<p>Is as a meeting of the petty 908 gods,</p>
<p>And you the queen on’t.</p>
<p>PERDITA Sir, my gracious lord,</p>
<p>To chide at your extremes 909 it not becomes me —</p>
<p>O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,</p>
<p>The gracious mark o’th’land 910 , you have obscured 911</p>
<p>With a swain’s wearing 912 , and me, poor lowly maid,</p>
<p>Most goddess-like pranked up 913 . But that our feasts</p>
<p>In every mess 914 have folly 915 and the feeders</p>
<p>Digest it with a custom 916 , I should blush</p>
<p>To see you so attired, swoon, I think,</p>
<p>To show myself a glass 917 .</p>
<p>FLORIZEL I bless the time</p>
<p>When my good falcon made her flight across</p>
<p>Thy father’s ground.</p>
<p>PERDITA Now Jove afford you cause!</p>
<p>To me the difference 918 forges dread. Your greatness</p>
<p>Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble</p>
<p>To think your father, by some accident 919 ,</p>
<p>Should pass this way as you did. O, the Fates!</p>
<p>How would he look, to see his work so noble</p>
<p>Vilely bound up 920 ? What would he say? Or how</p>
<p>Should I, in these my borrowed flaunts 921 , behold</p>
<p>The sternness 922 of his presence?</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Apprehend 923</p>
<p>Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,</p>
<p>Humbling their deities to love, have taken</p>
<p>The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter</p>
<p>Became a bull 924 , and bellowed: the green Neptune</p>
<p>A ram 925 , and bleated: and the fire-robed god,</p>
<p>Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain 926 ,</p>
<p>As I seem now. Their transformations</p>
<p>Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,</p>
<p>Nor in a way 927 so chaste, since my desires</p>
<p>Run not before 928 mine honour, nor my lusts</p>
<p>Burn hotter than my faith.</p>
<p>PERDITA O, but, sir,</p>
<p>Your resolution cannot hold, when ’tis</p>
<p>Opposed, as it must be, by th’power of the king.</p>
<p>One of these two must be necessities,</p>
<p>Which then will speak, that you must change this purpose,</p>
<p>Or I my life 929 .</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Thou dearest Perdita,</p>
<p>With these forced 930 thoughts, I prithee darken not</p>
<p>The mirth o’th’feast. Or 931 I’ll be thine, my fair,</p>
<p>Or not my father’s. For I cannot be</p>
<p>Mine own, nor anything to any, if</p>
<p>I be not thine. To this I am most constant,</p>
<p>Though 932 destiny say no. Be merry, gentle.</p>
<p>Strangle such thoughts as these with anything</p>
<p>That you behold the while 933 . Your guests are coming:</p>
<p>Lift up your countenance, as 934 it were the day</p>
<p>Of celebration of that nuptial which</p>
<p>We two have sworn shall come.</p>
<p>PERDITA O lady Fortune,</p>
<p>Stand you 935 auspicious!</p>
<p>FLORIZEL See, your guests approach.</p>
<p>Address 936 yourself to entertain them sprightly 937 ,</p>
<p>And let’s be red with mirth.</p>
<p>[Enter Shepherd, Clown, Mopsa, Dorcas and others, with Polixenes and
Camillo disguised ]</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Fie, daughter! When my old wife lived, upon</p>
<p>This day she was both pantler 938 , butler, cook,</p>
<p>Both dame 939 and servant, welcomed all, served all,</p>
<p>Would sing her song and dance her turn: now here,</p>
<p>At upper end o’th’table, now i’th’middle,</p>
<p>On his 940 shoulder, and his, her face o’fire</p>
<p>With labour and the thing she took to quench it,</p>
<p>She would to each one sip 941 . You are retired 942 ,</p>
<p>As if you were a feasted one and not</p>
<p>The hostess of the meeting. Pray you bid</p>
<p>These unknown friends to’s welcome, for it is</p>
<p>A way to make us better friends, more known.</p>
<p>Come, quench your blushes and present yourself</p>
<p>That which you are, mistress o’th’feast. Come on,</p>
<p>And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,</p>
<p>As your good flock shall prosper.</p>
<p>PERDITA Sir, welcome.</p>
<p>To Polixenes</p>
<p>It is my father’s will I should take on me</p>
<p>The hostess-ship o’th’day.— You’re welcome, sir.—</p>
<p>To Camillo</p>
<p>Give me those flowers there, Dorcas.— Reverend sirs,</p>
<p>For you there’s rosemary 943 and rue 944 . These keep</p>
<p>Gives flowers</p>
<p>Seeming and savour 945 all the winter long.</p>
<p>Grace and remembrance be to you both,</p>
<p>And welcome to our shearing!</p>
<p>POLIXENES Shepherdess,</p>
<p>A fair one are you — well you fit 946 our ages</p>
<p>With flowers of winter.</p>
<p>PERDITA Sir, the year growing ancient,</p>
<p>Not yet on summer’s death, nor on the birth</p>
<p>Of trembling winter 947 , the fairest flowers o’th’season</p>
<p>Are our carnations and streaked gillyvors 948 ,</p>
<p>Which some call nature’s bastards 949 . Of that kind</p>
<p>Our rustic garden’s barren, and I care not</p>
<p>To get slips 950 of them.</p>
<p>POLIXENES Wherefore 951 , gentle maiden,</p>
<p>Do you neglect 952 them?</p>
<p>PERDITA For 953 I have heard it said</p>
<p>There is an art which in their piedness 954 shares</p>
<p>With great creating nature 955 .</p>
<p>POLIXENES Say there be.</p>
<p>Yet nature is made better by no mean 956</p>
<p>But nature makes that mean, so over that art,</p>
<p>Which you say adds to nature, is an art</p>
<p>That nature makes 957 . You see, sweet maid, we marry</p>
<p>A gentler scion 958 to the wildest stock 959 ,</p>
<p>And make conceive a bark of baser kind</p>
<p>By bud of nobler race 960 . This is an art</p>
<p>Which does mend 961 nature, change it rather, but</p>
<p>The art itself is nature.</p>
<p>PERDITA So it is.</p>
<p>POLIXENES Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,</p>
<p>And do not call them bastards.</p>
<p>PERDITA I’ll not put</p>
<p>The dibble 962 in earth to set 963 one slip of them.</p>
<p>No more than were I painted 964 I would wish</p>
<p>This youth should say ’twere well and only therefore</p>
<p>Desire to breed by me. Here’s flowers for you:</p>
<p>Gives flowers</p>
<p>Hot 965 lavender, mints, savory 966 , marjoram,</p>
<p>The marigold, that goes to bed wi’th’sun</p>
<p>And with him rises weeping 967 . These are flowers</p>
<p>Of middle summer, and I think they are given</p>
<p>To men of middle age. You’re very welcome.</p>
<p>CAMILLO I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,</p>
<p>And only live by gazing.</p>
<p>PERDITA Out, alas! 968</p>
<p>You’d be so lean that blasts of January</p>
<p>Would blow you through and through.—</p>
<p>Now, my fair’st friend,</p>
<p>To Florizel</p>
<p>I would I had some flowers o’th’spring that might</p>
<p>Become your time of day,— and yours, and yours,</p>
<p>To Shepherdesses</p>
<p>That wear upon your virgin branches yet</p>
<p>Your maidenheads 969 growing.— O Proserpina 970 ,</p>
<p>For the flowers now that, frighted, thou let’st fall</p>
<p>From Dis’s wagon! Daffodils,</p>
<p>That come before the swallow dares 971 , and take 972</p>
<p>The winds of March with beauty: violets, dim 973 ,</p>
<p>But sweeter than the lids of Juno 974 ’s eyes</p>
<p>Or Cytherea 975 ’s breath: pale primroses</p>
<p>That die unmarried, ere they can behold</p>
<p>Bright Phoebus 976 in his strength — a malady</p>
<p>Most incident to maids 977 : bold oxlips and</p>
<p>The crown imperial 978 : lilies of all kinds,</p>
<p>The flower-de-luce 979 being one. O, these I lack,</p>
<p>To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,</p>
<p>To strew him o’er and o’er!</p>
<p>FLORIZEL What, like a corpse?</p>
<p>PERDITA No, like a bank for love to lie and play on.</p>
<p>Not like a corpse. Or if 980 , not to be buried,</p>
<p>But quick 981 and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers.</p>
<p>Methinks I play as I have seen them do</p>
<p>In Whitsun pastorals 982 . Sure this robe of mine</p>
<p>Does change my disposition.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL What you do</p>
<p>Still 983 betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,</p>
<p>I’d have you do it ever: when you sing,</p>
<p>I’d have you buy and sell so, so give alms 984 ,</p>
<p>Pray so, and, for the ord’ring 985 your affairs,</p>
<p>To sing them too. When you do dance, I wish you</p>
<p>A wave o’th’sea, that you might ever do</p>
<p>Nothing but that. Move still 986 , still so,</p>
<p>And own no other function 987 . Each your doing 988 ,</p>
<p>So singular 989 in each particular 990 ,</p>
<p>Crowns what you are doing in the present deeds 991 ,</p>
<p>That all your acts are queens.</p>
<p>PERDITA O Doricles 992 ,</p>
<p>Your praises are too large. But that your youth,</p>
<p>And the true 993 blood which peeps fairly through’t,</p>
<p>Do plainly give you out 994 an unstained shepherd,</p>
<p>With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,</p>
<p>You wooed me the false way 995 .</p>
<p>FLORIZEL I think you have</p>
<p>As little skill 996 to fear as I have purpose</p>
<p>To put you to’t. But come, our dance, I pray.</p>
<p>Your hand, my Perdita. So turtles 997 pair,</p>
<p>That never mean to part.</p>
<p>PERDITA I’ll swear for ’em.</p>
<p>They stand aside</p>
<p>POLIXENES This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever</p>
<p>To Camillo</p>
<p>Ran on the greensward 998 . Nothing she does or seems</p>
<p>But smacks of something greater than herself,</p>
<p>Too noble for this place.</p>
<p>CAMILLO He tells her something</p>
<p>That makes her blood look out 999 . Good sooth 1000 , she is</p>
<p>The queen of curds and cream 1001 .</p>
<p>CLOWN Come on, strike up!</p>
<p>DORCAS Mopsa must be your mistress 1002 . Marry, garlic,</p>
<p>To mend her kissing with 1003 !</p>
<p>MOPSA Now, in good time 1004 !</p>
<p>CLOWN Not a word, a word. We stand upon 1005 our manners.</p>
<p>Come, strike up!</p>
<p>Music</p>
<p>Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses</p>
<p>POLIXENES Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this</p>
<p>Which dances with your daughter?</p>
<p>SHEPHERD They call him Doricles, and boasts 1006 himself</p>
<p>To have a worthy feeding 1007 ; but I have it</p>
<p>Upon his own report and I believe it.</p>
<p>He looks like sooth 1008 . He says he loves my daughter.</p>
<p>I think so too, for never gazed the moon</p>
<p>Upon the water as he’ll stand and read,</p>
<p>As ’twere, my daughter’s eyes. And to be plain,</p>
<p>I think there is not half a kiss to choose</p>
<p>Who loves another best.</p>
<p>POLIXENES She dances featly 1009 .</p>
<p>SHEPHERD So she does anything, though I report it,</p>
<p>That should be silent. If young Doricles</p>
<p>Do light upon 1010 her, she shall bring him that</p>
<p>Which he not dreams of.</p>
<p>Enter Servant 1011</p>
<p>SERVANT O, master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the door, you
would never dance again after a tabor 1012 and pipe. No, the bagpipe
could not move you. He sings several tunes faster than you’ll tell 1013
money. He utters them as he had eaten ballads 1014 and all men’s ears
grew 1015 to his tunes.</p>
<p>CLOWN He could never come better 1016 . He shall come in. I love a
ballad but even too well, if it be doleful matter merrily set down, or a
very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably.</p>
<p>SERVANT He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes. No milliner
1017 can so fit his customers with gloves. He has the prettiest
love-songs for maids, so without bawdry 1018 , which is strange, with
such delicate burdens 1019 of dildos and fadings 1020 , ‘jump her and
thump her’ 1021 . And where some stretch-mouthed 1022 rascal would, as
it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter 1023 , he
makes the maid to answer ‘Whoop 1024 , do me no harm, good man’, puts
him off, slights him, with ‘Whoop, do me no harm, good man’.</p>
<p>POLIXENES This is a brave 1025 fellow.</p>
<p>CLOWN Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited 1026 fellow.
Has he any unbraided 1027 wares?</p>
<p>SERVANT He hath ribbons of all the colours i’th’rainbow; points 1028
more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle, though they
come to him by th’gross 1029 : inkles 1030 , caddisses 1031 , cambrics
1032 , lawns 1033 . Why, he sings ’em over 1034 as they were gods or
goddesses. You would think a smock 1035 were a she-angel, he so chants
to the sleeve-hand 1036 and the work about 1037 the square 1038
on’t.</p>
<p>CLOWN Prithee bring him in, and let him approach singing.</p>
<p>PERDITA Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in’s tunes.</p>
<p>Servant goes to door</p>
<p>CLOWN You have 1039 of these pedlars, that have more in them than
you’d think, sister.</p>
<p>PERDITA Ay, good brother, or go about 1040 to think.</p>
<p>Enter Autolycus, singing</p>
<p>He wears a false beard and carries a pack</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Lawn as white as driven snow,</p>
<p>Song</p>
<p>Cypress 1041 black as e’er was crow,</p>
<p>Gloves as sweet 1042 as damask roses,</p>
<p>Masks 1043 for faces and for noses,</p>
<p>Bugle 1044 bracelet, necklace amber,</p>
<p>Perfume for a lady’s chamber,</p>
<p>Golden quoifs 1045 and stomachers 1046 ,</p>
<p>For my lads to give their dears,</p>
<p>Pins and poking-sticks 1047 of steel,</p>
<p>What maids lack from head to heel.</p>
<p>Come buy of me, come. Come buy, come buy.</p>
<p>Buy lads, or else your lasses cry. Come buy!</p>
<p>CLOWN If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take no money
of me, but being enthralled 1048 as I am, it will also be the bondage
1049 of certain ribbons and gloves.</p>
<p>MOPSA I was promised them against 1050 the feast, but they come not
too late now.</p>
<p>DORCAS He hath promised you more than that 1051 , or there be
liars.</p>
<p>MOPSA He hath paid you 1052 all he promised you. Maybe he has paid
you more, which will shame you to give him again 1053 .</p>
<p>CLOWN Is there no manners left among maids? Will they wear their
placket 1054 s where they should bear their faces 1055 ? Is there not
milking-time, when you are going to bed, or kiln-hole 1056 , to whistle
of these secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all our guests?
’Tis well they are whisp’ring. Clamour 1057 your tongues, and not a word
more.</p>
<p>MOPSA I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace 1058 and a
pair of sweet gloves.</p>
<p>CLOWN Have I not told thee how I was cozened 1059 by the way and lost
all my money?</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad 1060 : therefore
it behoves 1061 men to be wary.</p>
<p>CLOWN Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS I hope so, sir, for I have about me many parcels of charge
1062 .</p>
<p>CLOWN What hast here? Ballads?</p>
<p>MOPSA Pray now, buy some. I love a ballad in print alife 1063 , for
then we are sure they are true.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Here’s one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer 1064 ‘s
wife was brought to bed of 1065 twenty money-bags at a burden 1066 and
how she longed to eat adders’ heads and toads carbonadoed 1067 .</p>
<p>MOPSA Is it true, think you?</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Very true, and but a month old.</p>
<p>DORCAS Bless me from marrying a usurer!</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Here’s the midwife’s name to’t, one Mistress Tale-porter
1068 , and five or six honest wives that were present. Why should I
carry lies abroad?</p>
<p>MOPSA Pray you now, buy it.</p>
<p>CLOWN Come on, lay it by 1069 , and let’s first see more ballads.
We’ll buy the other things anon.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Here’s another ballad of a fish that appeared upon the
coast on Wednesday the fourscore 1070 of April, forty thousand fathom
1071 above water, and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids.
It was thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold fish for she
would not exchange flesh 1072 with one that loved her. The ballad is
very pitiful and as true.</p>
<p>DORCAS Is it true too, think you?</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Five justices’ 1073 hands 1074 at it, and witnesses more
than my pack 1075 will hold.</p>
<p>CLOWN Lay it by too; another.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.</p>
<p>MOPSA Let’s have some merry ones.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Why, this is a passing 1076 merry one and goes to the tune
of ‘Two maids wooing a man’. There’s scarce a maid westward but she
sings it. ’Tis in request 1077 , I can tell you.</p>
<p>MOPSA We can both sing it. If thou’lt bear a part 1078 , thou shalt
hear. ’Tis in three parts.</p>
<p>DORCAS We had the tune on’t 1079 a month ago.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS I can bear my part. You must know ’tis my occupation. Have
at it with you 1080 .</p>
<p>[They sing the ] song</p>
<p>AUTOLYCU Get you hence, for I must go</p>
<p>Where it fits not you to know.</p>
<p>DORCAS Whither?</p>
<p>MOPSA O, whither?</p>
<p>DORCAS Whither?</p>
<p>MOPSA It becomes thy oath full well,</p>
<p>Thou to me thy secrets tell.</p>
<p>DORCAS Me too, let me go thither.</p>
<p>MOPSA Or 1081 thou goest to th’grange 1082 or mill.</p>
<p>DORCAS If to either, thou dost ill 1083 .</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Neither.</p>
<p>DORCAS What, neither?</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Neither.</p>
<p>DORCAS Thou hast sworn my love to be.</p>
<p>MOPSA Thou hast sworn it more to me.</p>
<p>Then whither goest? Say, whither?</p>
<p>CLOWN We’ll have this song out anon 1084 by ourselves. My father and
the gentlemen are in sad 1085 talk, and we’ll not trouble them. Come,
bring away thy pack after me. Wenches, I’ll buy for you both. Pedlar,
let’s have the first choice. Follow me, girls.</p>
<p>[Exit with Dorcas and Mopsa ]</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS And you shall pay well for ’em.</p>
<p>Song</p>
<p>Follows them, singing</p>
<p>Will you buy any tape,</p>
<p>Or lace for your cape,</p>
<p>My dainty duck, my dear-a?</p>
<p>Any silk, any thread,</p>
<p>Any toys 1086 for your head,</p>
<p>Of the new’st and finest, finest wear-a?</p>
<p>Come to the pedlar.</p>
<p>Money’s a meddler.</p>
<p>That doth utter 1087 all men’s ware-a 1088 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>[Enter Servant ]</p>
<p>SERVANT Master, there is three carters 1089 , three shepherds, three
neat-herds 1090 , three swine-herds, that have made themselves all men
of hair 1091 . They call themselves Saltiers 1092 , and they have a
dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols 1093 , because
they are not in’t. But they themselves are o’th’mind, if it be not too
rough for some that know little but bowling 1094 , it will please
plentifully.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Away! We’ll none on’t; here has been too much homely 1095
foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.</p>
<p>POLIXENES You weary those that refresh us. Pray let’s see these four
threes 1096 of herdsmen.</p>
<p>SERVANT One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath danced
before the king, and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot
and a half by th’square 1097 .</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Leave your prating 1098 . Since these good men are pleased,
let them come in. But quickly now.</p>
<p>SERVANT Why, they stay 1099 at door, sir.</p>
<p>Goes to the door</p>
<p>Here a dance of twelve Satyrs</p>
<p>POLIXENES O, father 1100 , you’ll know more of that hereafter 1101
.—</p>
<p>To Shepherd</p>
<p>Is it not too far gone? ’Tis time to part them.</p>
<p>To Camillo</p>
<p>He’s simple 1102 and tells much.—</p>
<p>How now, fair shepherd!</p>
<p>To Florizel</p>
<p>Your heart is full of something that does take</p>
<p>Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young</p>
<p>And handed 1103 love as you do, I was wont 1104</p>
<p>To load my she with knacks 1105 . I would have ransacked</p>
<p>The pedlar’s silken treasury and have poured it</p>
<p>To her acceptance. You have let him go</p>
<p>And nothing marted 1106 with him. If your lass</p>
<p>Interpretation should abuse 1107 and call this</p>
<p>Your lack of love or bounty 1108 , you were straited 1109</p>
<p>For a reply, at least if you make a care</p>
<p>Of happy holding her 1110 .</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Old sir, I know</p>
<p>She prizes not such trifles as these are.</p>
<p>The gifts she looks 1111 from me are packed and locked</p>
<p>Up in my heart, which I have given already,</p>
<p>But not delivered 1112 . O, hear me breathe my life 1113</p>
<p>Before this ancient sir, whom, it should seem,</p>
<p>Hath sometime 1114 loved.— I take thy hand, this hand,</p>
<p>To Perdita</p>
<p>As soft as dove’s down and as white as it,</p>
<p>Or Ethiopian’s tooth, or the fanned snow that’s bolted 1115</p>
<p>By th’northern blasts 1116 twice o’er.</p>
<p>Takes her hand</p>
<p>POLIXENES What follows this?</p>
<p>How prettily th’young swain seems to wash 1117</p>
<p>The hand was 1118 fair before! I have put you out 1119 .</p>
<p>But to 1120 your protestation 1121 : let me hear</p>
<p>What you profess.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Do, and be witness to’t.</p>
<p>POLIXENES And this my neighbour too?</p>
<p>FLORIZEL And he, and more</p>
<p>Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all;</p>
<p>That were I crowned the most imperial monarch,</p>
<p>Thereof 1122 most worthy, were I the fairest youth</p>
<p>That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge</p>
<p>More than was ever man’s, I would not prize them</p>
<p>Without her love; for her employ them all,</p>
<p>Commend them and condemn them to her service</p>
<p>Or to their own perdition 1123 .</p>
<p>POLIXENES Fairly offered.</p>
<p>CAMILLO This shows a sound affection.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD But, my daughter,</p>
<p>Say you the like to him?</p>
<p>PERDITA I cannot speak</p>
<p>So well, nothing so well. No, nor mean better.</p>
<p>By th’pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out</p>
<p>The purity of his 1124 .</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Take hands, a bargain!</p>
<p>And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to’t.</p>
<p>I give my daughter to him, and will make</p>
<p>Her portion 1125 equal his.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL O, that must be</p>
<p>I’th’virtue of your daughter: one being dead 1126 ,</p>
<p>I shall have more than you can dream of yet,</p>
<p>Enough then for your wonder. But come on,</p>
<p>Contract us ’fore these witnesses 1127 .</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Come, your hand.</p>
<p>And, daughter, yours.</p>
<p>POLIXENES Soft 1128 , swain 1129 , awhile, beseech you.</p>
<p>Have you a father?</p>
<p>FLORIZEL I have, but what of him?</p>
<p>POLIXENES Knows he of this?</p>
<p>FLORIZEL He neither does nor shall.</p>
<p>POLIXENES Methinks a father</p>
<p>Is at the nuptial of his son a guest</p>
<p>That best becomes 1130 the table. Pray you once more,</p>
<p>Is not your father grown incapable</p>
<p>Of 1131 reasonable affairs? Is he not stupid</p>
<p>With age and alt’ring rheums 1132 ? Can he speak? Hear?</p>
<p>Know man from man? Dispute 1133 his own estate?</p>
<p>Lies he not bed-rid? And again does nothing</p>
<p>But what he did being childish 1134 ?</p>
<p>FLORIZEL No, good sir.</p>
<p>He has his health and ampler strength indeed</p>
<p>Than most have of his age.</p>
<p>POLIXENES By my white beard,</p>
<p>You offer him, if this be so, a wrong</p>
<p>Something unfilial 1135 . Reason 1136 my son</p>
<p>Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason</p>
<p>The father, all whose joy is nothing else</p>
<p>But fair posterity 1137 hold some counsel 1138 , should hold some
counsel</p>
<p>In such a business.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL I yield 1139 all this.</p>
<p>But for some other reasons, my grave sir,</p>
<p>Which ’tis not fit you know, I not acquaint</p>
<p>My father of this business.</p>
<p>POLIXENES Let him know’t.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL He shall not.</p>
<p>POLIXENES Prithee let him.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL No, he must not.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Let him, my son. He shall not need to grieve</p>
<p>At knowing of thy choice.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Come, come, he must not.</p>
<p>Mark 1140 our contract.</p>
<p>POLIXENES Mark your divorce, young sir,</p>
<p>Takes off disguise</p>
<p>Whom son I dare not call. Thou art too base</p>
<p>To be acknowledged. Thou a sceptre’s heir,</p>
<p>That thus affects 1141 a sheep-hook 1142 !— Thou, old traitor,</p>
<p>To Shepherd</p>
<p>I am sorry that by hanging thee I can</p>
<p>But shorten thy life one week.— And thou, fresh piece</p>
<p>To Perdita</p>
<p>Of excellent 1143 witchcraft, who of force 1144 must know</p>
<p>The royal fool thou cop’st with 1145 —</p>
<p>SHEPHERD O, my heart!</p>
<p>POLIXENES I’ll have thy beauty scratched with briers and made</p>
<p>More homely 1146 than thy state.— For thee, fond 1147 boy,</p>
<p>To Florizel</p>
<p>If I may ever know thou dost but sigh</p>
<p>That thou no more shalt see this knack 1148 , as never</p>
<p>I mean thou shalt, we’ll bar thee from succession 1149 ,</p>
<p>Not hold thee of our blood 1150 , no, not our kin,</p>
<p>Far than Deucalion off 1151 . Mark thou my words.</p>
<p>Follow us to the court.— Thou churl 1152 , for this time,</p>
<p>To Shepherd</p>
<p>Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee</p>
<p>From the dead blow of it 1153 .— And you, enchantment 1154 ,—</p>
<p>To Perdita</p>
<p>Worthy enough a herdsman — yea, him 1155 too,</p>
<p>That makes himself, but for our honour therein,</p>
<p>Unworthy thee 1156 — if ever henceforth thou</p>
<p>These rural latches 1157 to his entrance open,</p>
<p>Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,</p>
<p>I will devise a death as cruel for thee</p>
<p>As thou art tender 1158 to’t.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>PERDITA Even here undone 1159 !</p>
<p>I was not much afeard, for once or twice</p>
<p>I was about to speak and tell him plainly,</p>
<p>The selfsame sun that shines upon his court</p>
<p>Hides not his visage 1160 from our cottage but</p>
<p>Looks on alike 1161 .— Will’t please you, sir, be gone?</p>
<p>To Florizel</p>
<p>I told you what would come of this. Beseech you</p>
<p>Of your own state take care. This dream of mine —</p>
<p>Being now awake, I’ll queen it no inch further,</p>
<p>But milk my ewes and weep.</p>
<p>CAMILLO Why, how now, father!</p>
<p>Speak ere thou diest.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD I cannot speak, nor think</p>
<p>Nor dare to know that which I know.— O, sir,</p>
<p>To Florizel</p>
<p>You have undone a man of fourscore three 1162 ,</p>
<p>That thought to fill his grave in quiet 1163 , yea,</p>
<p>To die upon the bed my father died,</p>
<p>To lie close by his honest bones; but now</p>
<p>Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me</p>
<p>Where no priest shovels in dust 1164 .— O cursèd wretch,</p>
<p>To Perdita</p>
<p>That knew’st this was the prince, and wouldst adventure 1165</p>
<p>To mingle faith 1166 with him! Undone, undone!</p>
<p>If I might die within this hour, I have lived</p>
<p>To die when I desire.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Why look you so upon me?</p>
<p>I am but sorry, not afeard. Delayed,</p>
<p>But nothing altered. What I was, I am.</p>
<p>More straining on for plucking back 1167 , not following</p>
<p>My leash unwillingly 1168 .</p>
<p>CAMILLO Gracious my lord,</p>
<p>You know your father’s temper. At this time</p>
<p>He will allow no speech — which I do guess</p>
<p>You do not purpose 1169 to him — and as hardly 1170</p>
<p>Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear.</p>
<p>Then, till the fury of his highness settle,</p>
<p>Come not before him.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL I not purpose it.</p>
<p>I think, Camillo? 1171</p>
<p>CAMILLO Even he, my lord.</p>
<p>May remove his disguise</p>
<p>PERDITA How often have I told you ’twould be thus!</p>
<p>How often said, my dignity 1172 would last</p>
<p>But 1173 till ’twere known!</p>
<p>FLORIZEL It cannot fail but by</p>
<p>The violation of my faith 1174 , and then</p>
<p>Let nature crush the sides o’th’earth together</p>
<p>And mar the seeds 1175 within! Lift up thy looks 1176 .</p>
<p>From my succession wipe 1177 me, father. I</p>
<p>Am heir to my affection.</p>
<p>CAMILLO Be advised 1178 .</p>
<p>FLORIZEL I am, and by my fancy 1179 . If my reason</p>
<p>Will thereto be obedient, I have reason.</p>
<p>If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,</p>
<p>Do bid it welcome.</p>
<p>CAMILLO This is desperate 1180 , sir.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL So call it, but it does fulfil my vow.</p>
<p>I needs must think it honesty 1181 . Camillo,</p>
<p>Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp 1182 that may</p>
<p>Be thereat gleaned, for all the sun sees or</p>
<p>The close 1183 earth wombs 1184 or the profound 1185 seas hides</p>
<p>In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath</p>
<p>To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you</p>
<p>As you have ever been my father’s honoured friend,</p>
<p>When he shall miss me — as, in faith, I mean not</p>
<p>To see him any more — cast your good counsels</p>
<p>Upon his passion 1186 . Let myself and fortune</p>
<p>Tug 1187 for the time to come. This you may know,</p>
<p>And so deliver 1188 , I am put to sea</p>
<p>With her whom here I cannot hold on shore.</p>
<p>And most opportune to her need, I have</p>
<p>A vessel rides fast by 1189 , but not prepared</p>
<p>For this design. What course I mean to hold 1190</p>
<p>Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor</p>
<p>Concern me the reporting 1191 .</p>
<p>CAMILLO O, my lord,</p>
<p>I would your spirit were easier for advice 1192 ,</p>
<p>Or stronger for your need.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Hark, Perdita.—</p>
<p>Takes her aside</p>
<p>I’ll hear you by and by.</p>
<p>To Camillo</p>
<p>CAMILLO He’s irremovable 1193 ,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if</p>
<p>His going I could frame to serve my turn 1194 ,</p>
<p>Save him from danger, do him love and honour,</p>
<p>Purchase 1195 the sight again of dear Sicilia</p>
<p>And that unhappy king, my master, whom</p>
<p>I so much thirst to see.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Now, good Camillo,</p>
<p>I am so fraught 1196 with curious 1197 business that</p>
<p>I leave out ceremony 1198 .</p>
<p>CAMILLO Sir, I think</p>
<p>You have heard of my poor 1199 services, i’th’love</p>
<p>That I have borne your father?</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Very nobly</p>
<p>Have you deserved. It is my father’s music</p>
<p>To speak your deeds, not little of his care</p>
<p>To have them recompensed as thought on 1200 .</p>
<p>CAMILLO Well, my lord,</p>
<p>If you may please to think I love the king</p>
<p>And through him what’s nearest to him, which is</p>
<p>Your gracious self, embrace but my direction 1201 ,</p>
<p>If your more ponderous 1202 and settled 1203 project</p>
<p>May suffer alteration 1204 . On mine honour,</p>
<p>I’ll point you where you shall have such receiving 1205</p>
<p>As shall become your highness, where you may</p>
<p>Enjoy 1206 your mistress, from the whom I see,</p>
<p>There’s no disjunction 1207 to be made, but by —</p>
<p>As heavens forfend 1208 ! — your ruin. Marry her,</p>
<p>And, with my best endeavours in your absence,</p>
<p>Your discontenting 1209 father strive to qualify 1210</p>
<p>And bring him up to liking 1211 .</p>
<p>FLORIZEL How, Camillo,</p>
<p>May this, almost a miracle, be done?</p>
<p>That I may call thee something more than man</p>
<p>And after that trust to 1212 thee.</p>
<p>CAMILLO Have you thought on 1213</p>
<p>A place whereto you’ll go?</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Not any yet,</p>
<p>But as th’unthought-on accident is guilty</p>
<p>To what we wildly do 1214 , so we profess</p>
<p>Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies</p>
<p>Of every wind that blows 1215 .</p>
<p>CAMILLO Then list 1216 to me.</p>
<p>This follows, if you will not change your purpose</p>
<p>But undergo this flight: make for Sicilia,</p>
<p>And there present yourself and your fair princess,</p>
<p>For so I see she must be, ’fore Leontes;</p>
<p>She shall be habited 1217 as it becomes</p>
<p>The partner of your bed. Methinks I see</p>
<p>Leontes opening his free arms and weeping</p>
<p>His welcomes forth, asks thee there ‘Son, forgiveness’,</p>
<p>As ’twere i’th’father’s person 1218 , kisses the hands</p>
<p>Of your fresh princess; o’er and o’er divides him</p>
<p>’Twixt his unkindness 1219 and his kindness. Th’one</p>
<p>He chides to hell and bids the other grow</p>
<p>Faster than thought or time.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Worthy Camillo,</p>
<p>What colour 1220 for my visitation shall I</p>
<p>Hold up before him?</p>
<p>CAMILLO Sent by the king your father</p>
<p>To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,</p>
<p>The manner of your bearing 1221 towards him, with</p>
<p>What you as 1222 from your father shall deliver —</p>
<p>Things known betwixt us three — I’ll write you down,</p>
<p>The which shall point you forth at every sitting 1223</p>
<p>What you must say, that he shall not perceive</p>
<p>But that you have your father’s bosom 1224 there</p>
<p>And speak his very heart.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL I am bound to you.</p>
<p>There is some sap 1225 in this.</p>
<p>CAMILLO A course more promising</p>
<p>Than a wild dedication of yourselves</p>
<p>To unpathed 1226 waters, undreamed shores, most certain</p>
<p>To miseries enough, no hope to help you,</p>
<p>But as you shake off one 1227 to take another.</p>
<p>Nothing so certain as 1228 your anchors, who</p>
<p>Do their best office if they can but stay 1229 you</p>
<p>Where you’ll be loath to be. Besides, you know</p>
<p>Prosperity’s the very bond of love 1230 ,</p>
<p>Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together</p>
<p>Affliction alters 1231 .</p>
<p>PERDITA One of these is true:</p>
<p>I think affliction may subdue the cheek 1232 ,</p>
<p>But not take in 1233 the mind.</p>
<p>CAMILLO Yea? Say you so?</p>
<p>There shall not at your father’s house these seven years 1234</p>
<p>Be born another such 1235 .</p>
<p>FLORIZEL My good Camillo,</p>
<p>She’s as forward of her breeding as</p>
<p>She is i’th’rear our birth 1236 .</p>
<p>CAMILLO I cannot say ’tis pity</p>
<p>She lacks instructions 1237 , for she seems a mistress</p>
<p>To most that teach.</p>
<p>PERDITA Your pardon, sir. For this</p>
<p>I’ll blush you thanks.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL My prettiest Perdita!</p>
<p>But, O, the thorns we stand upon!— Camillo,</p>
<p>Preserver of my father, now of me,</p>
<p>The medicine of our house, how shall we do?</p>
<p>We are not furnished 1238 like Bohemia’s son,</p>
<p>Nor shall appear 1239 in Sicilia.</p>
<p>CAMILLO My lord,</p>
<p>Fear none of this. I think you know my fortunes 1240</p>
<p>Do all lie there. It shall be so my care</p>
<p>To have you royally appointed 1241 as if</p>
<p>The scene you play were mine 1242 . For instance 1243 , sir,</p>
<p>That you may know you shall not want 1244 , one word.</p>
<p>They talk apart</p>
<p>Enter Autolycus</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Ha, ha! What a fool honesty is! And trust, his sworn
brother, a very simple gentleman. I have sold all my trumpery 1245 : not
a counterfeit stone 1246 , not a ribbon, glass 1247 , pomander 1248 ,
brooch, table-book 1249 , ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie,
bracelet, horn-ring 1250 , to keep my pack from fasting 1251 . They
throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed 1252
and brought a benediction 1253 to the buyer, by which means I saw whose
purse was best in picture 1254 , and what I saw, to my good use 1255 I
remembered. My clown, who wants 1256 but something 1257 to be a
reasonable man, grew 1258 so in love with the wenches’ song, that he
would not stir his pettitoes 1259 till he had both tune and words, which
so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in
ears 1260 . You might have pinched a placket 1261 , it was senseless;
’twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse 1262 . I would have filed
keys off that hung in chains. No hearing, no feeling, but my sir’s 1263
song, and admiring the nothing 1264 of it. So that in this time of
lethargy I picked and cut most of their festival purses, and had not the
old man come in with a whoo-bub 1265 against his daughter and the king’s
son and scared my choughs 1266 from the chaff 1267 , I had not left a
purse alive in the whole army.</p>
<p>Camillo, Florizel and Perdita come forward</p>
<p>CAMILLO Nay, but my letters, by this means being there</p>
<p>So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL And those that you’ll procure from King Leontes—</p>
<p>CAMILLO Shall satisfy 1268 your father.</p>
<p>PERDITA Happy be you!</p>
<p>All that you speak shows fair.</p>
<p>CAMILLO Who have we here?</p>
<p>Sees Autolycus</p>
<p>We’ll make an instrument of this, omit</p>
<p>Nothing 1269 may give us aid.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CAMILLO How now, good fellow? Why shakest thou so? Fear not, man.
Here’s no harm intended to thee.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS I am a poor fellow, sir.</p>
<p>CAMILLO Why, be so still. Here’s nobody will steal that from thee.
Yet for the outside of thy poverty 1270 we must make an exchange:
therefore discase 1271 thee instantly — thou must think 1272 there’s a
necessity in’t — and change garments with this gentleman. Though the
pennyworth 1273 on his side be the worst, yet hold thee, there’s some
boot 1274 .</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS I am a poor fellow, sir.— I know ye well enough.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CAMILLO Nay, prithee, dispatch 1275 : the gentleman is half flayed
1276 already.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Are you in earnest 1277 , sir? I smell the trick 1278 on’t
1279 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Dispatch, I prithee.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Indeed, I have had earnest, but I cannot with conscience
take it.</p>
<p>CAMILLO Unbuckle, unbuckle.</p>
<p>Florizel and Autolycus exchange clothes</p>
<p>Fortunate mistress — let my prophecy</p>
<p>Come home to ye 1280 ! — you must retire yourself</p>
<p>Into some covert 1281 ; take your sweetheart’s hat</p>
<p>And pluck 1282 it o’er your brows, muffle your face,</p>
<p>Dismantle you 1283 , and, as you can, disliken 1284</p>
<p>The truth of your own seeming 1285 , that you may —</p>
<p>For I do fear eyes over 1286 — to shipboard</p>
<p>Get undescried 1287 .</p>
<p>PERDITA I see the play so lies 1288</p>
<p>That I must bear a part.</p>
<p>CAMILLO No remedy 1289 .</p>
<p>Have you done there?</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Should I now meet my father,</p>
<p>He would not call me son.</p>
<p>CAMILLO Nay, you shall have no hat.</p>
<p>Gives hat to Perdita</p>
<p>Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Adieu, sir.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL O Perdita, what have we twain 1290 forgot!</p>
<p>Pray you a word.</p>
<p>CAMILLO What I do next, shall be to tell the king</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Of this escape and whither they are bound.</p>
<p>Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail</p>
<p>To force him after 1291 , in whose company</p>
<p>I shall review 1292 Sicilia, for whose sight</p>
<p>I have a woman’s 1293 longing.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Fortune speed 1294 us!</p>
<p>Thus we set on, Camillo, to th’seaside.</p>
<p>CAMILLO The swifter speed the better.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Florizel, Perdita and Camillo ]</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS I understand the business, I hear it. To have an open ear,
a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is necessary for a cutpurse 1295 ; a
good nose is requisite also, to smell out work for th’other senses. I
see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. What an exchange
1296 had this been without boot 1297 ? What a boot 1298 is here with
this exchange? Sure, the gods do this year connive at 1299 us, and we
may do anything extempore 1300 . The prince himself is about a piece of
iniquity 1301 , stealing away from his father with his clog 1302 at his
heels. If I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king
withal 1303 , I would not do’t. I hold it the more knavery to conceal
it; and therein am I constant 1304 to my profession.</p>
<p>Enter Clown and Shepherd</p>
<p>Carrying fardel 1305 and box</p>
<p>Aside, aside. Here is more matter for a hot 1306 brain. Every lane’s
end, every shop, church, session 1307 , hanging, yields a careful 1308
man work.</p>
<p>He stands aside</p>
<p>CLOWN See, see. What a man you are now! There is no other way but to
tell the king she’s a changeling 1309 and none of your flesh and
blood.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Nay, but hear me.</p>
<p>CLOWN Nay, but hear me.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Go to 1310 , then.</p>
<p>CLOWN She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh and blood
has not offended the king, and so your flesh and blood is not to be
punished by him. Show those things you found about her, those secret
things, all but what she has with her. This being done, let the law go
whistle, I warrant you.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his son’s
pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man, neither to his father nor
to me, to go about to make me the king’s brother-in-law.</p>
<p>CLOWN Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you could have been
to him and then your blood had been the dearer by I know how much an
ounce 1311 .</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Very wisely, puppies 1312 !</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Well, let us to the king. There is that in this fardel will
make him scratch his beard.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS I know not what impediment this complaint 1313 may be to
the flight of my master 1314 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CLOWN Pray heartily he be at palace.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Though I am not naturally honest, I am so sometimes by
chance: let me pocket 1315 up my pedlar’s excrement 1316 .— How now,
rustics! Whither are you bound?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Takes off his false beard</p>
<p>SHEPHERD To th’palace, an it like 1317 your worship.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Your affairs there? What? With whom? The condition 1318 of
that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your names, your ages, of what
having 1319 , breeding, and any thing that is fitting to be known,
discover 1320 .</p>
<p>CLOWN We are but plain 1321 fellows, sir.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no lying; it
becomes none but tradesmen, and they often give us soldiers the lie 1322
, but we pay them for it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel:
therefore they do not give us the lie 1323 .</p>
<p>CLOWN Your worship had like to have given us one 1324 , if you had
not taken yourself with the manner 1325 .</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Are you a courtier, an’t like you, sir?</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. See’st thou not
the air of the court in these enfoldings 1326 ? Hath not my gait 1327 in
it the measure 1328 of the court? Receives not thy nose court-odour from
me? Reflect I not on thy baseness 1329 court-contempt? Think’st thou,
for that 1330 I insinuate 1331 or toaze 1332 from thee thy business, I
am therefore no courtier? I am courtier cap-a-pe 1333 ; and one that
will either push on or pluck back thy business there: whereupon I
command thee to open thy affair 1334 .</p>
<p>SHEPHERD My business, sir, is to the king.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS What advocate 1335 hast thou to him?</p>
<p>SHEPHERD I know not, an’t like you.</p>
<p>CLOWN Advocate’s the court-word for a pheasant 1336 . Say you have
none.</p>
<p>Aside to the Shepherd</p>
<p>SHEPHERD None, sir. I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS How blessed are we that are not simple men! Yet nature
might have made me as these are, therefore I will not disdain.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CLOWN This cannot be but 1337 a great courtier.</p>
<p>To Shepherd</p>
<p>SHEPHERD His garments are rich, but he wears them not handsomely.</p>
<p>CLOWN He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical 1338 . A
great man, I’ll warrant; I know by the picking on’s teeth 1339 .</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS The fardel there? What’s i’th’fardel? Wherefore that
box?</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box, which
none must know but the king, and which he shall know within this hour,
if I may come to th’speech of him.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Age 1340 , thou hast lost thy labour.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Why, sir?</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS The king is not at the palace. He is gone aboard a new ship
to purge melancholy and air himself, for, if thou be’st capable of
things serious 1341 , thou must know the king is full of grief.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD So ’tis said, sir, about his son, that should have married a
shepherd’s daughter.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS If that shepherd be not in hand-fast 1342 , let him fly
1343 ; the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall feel, will break
the back of man, the heart of monster.</p>
<p>CLOWN Think you so, sir?</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy 1344 and
vengeance bitter, but those that are germane 1345 to him, though removed
fifty times, shall all come under the hangman, which though it be great
pity, yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue 1346 a
ram-tender 1347 , to offer 1348 to have his daughter come into grace
1349 ! Some say he shall be stoned, but that death is too soft for him,
say I. Draw our throne into a sheep-cote 1350 ? All deaths are too few,
the sharpest too easy.</p>
<p>CLOWN Has the old man e’er a son, sir, do you hear, an’t like you,
sir?</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS He has a son, who shall be flayed alive, then ’nointed 1351
over with honey, set on the head of a wasp’s nest, then stand till he be
three quarters and a dram 1352 dead, then recovered again with
aqua-vitae 1353 or some other hot infusion, then, raw as he is, and in
the hottest day prognostication proclaims 1354 , shall he be set against
a brick wall, the sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he is
to behold him with flies blown 1355 to death. But what talk we of these
traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smiled at, their offences
being so capital 1356 ? Tell me, for you seem to 1357 be honest plain
men, what you have to the king. Being something gently considered 1358 ,
I’ll bring you where he is aboard, tender 1359 your persons to his
presence, whisper him 1360 in your behalfs; and if it be in man 1361
besides the king to effect your suits, here is man shall do it.</p>
<p>CLOWN He seems to be of great authority. Close 1362 with him, give
him gold; and though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft led by
the nose with gold. Show the inside of your purse to the outside of his
hand, and no more ado. Remember ‘stoned’ and ‘flayed alive’.</p>
<p>To Shepherd</p>
<p>SHEPHERD An’t please you, sir, to undertake the business for us, here
is that 1363 gold I have. I’ll make it as much more and leave this young
man in pawn 1364 till I bring it you.</p>
<p>Offers gold</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS After I have done what I promised?</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Ay, sir.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS Well, give me the moiety 1365 .— Are you a party in this
business?</p>
<p>Takes gold/To Clown</p>
<p>CLOWN In some sort, sir. But though my case 1366 be a pitiful one, I
hope I shall not be flayed out of it.</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS O, that’s the case of the shepherd’s son. Hang him, he’ll
be made an example.</p>
<p>CLOWN Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show our strange
sights. He must know ’tis none of your daughter nor my sister. We are
gone else 1367 . Sir, I will give you as much as this old man does when
the business is performed, and remain, as he says, your pawn till it be
brought you.</p>
<p>To Shepherd</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS I will trust you. Walk before 1368 toward the seaside. Go
on the right hand, I will but look upon the hedge 1369 and follow
you.</p>
<p>CLOWN We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Let’s before as he bids us. He was provided to do us
good.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Shepherd and Clown ]</p>
<p>AUTOLYCUS If I had a mind to be honest, I see fortune would not
suffer 1370 me. She drops booties 1371 in my mouth. I am courted 1372
now with a double occasion 1373 : gold and a means to do the prince my
master good; which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement? I
will bring these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him 1374 . If he
think it fit to shore them 1375 again and that the complaint they have
to the king concerns him nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far
officious 1376 proof against 1377 , for I am proof against that title
and what shame else belongs to’t. To him will I present them. There may
be matter 1378 in it.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
