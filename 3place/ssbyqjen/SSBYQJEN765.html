<h4 id="scene-1-1-running-scene-1">Scene 1 1 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Dead march 2 . Enter the funeral of King Henry the Fifth, attended on
by the Duke of Bedford, Regent of France; the Duke of Gloucester,
Protector; the Duke of Exeter, [the Earl of ] Warwick, the Bishop of
Winchester, and the Duke of Somerset, [and Heralds ]</p>
<p>BEDFORD Hung be the heavens with black 3 : yield, day, to night!</p>
<p>Comets 4 , importing change of times and states 5 ,</p>
<p>Brandish 6 your crystal tresses 7 in the sky,</p>
<p>And with them scourge 8 the bad revolting 9 stars 10</p>
<p>That have consented unto 11 Henry’s death:</p>
<p>King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long 12 :</p>
<p>England ne’er lost a king of so much worth.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER England ne’er had a king until his time:</p>
<p>Virtue 13 he had, deserving to command:</p>
<p>His brandished sword did blind men with his 14 beams:</p>
<p>His arms spread wider than a dragon’s wings:</p>
<p>His sparkling eyes, replete with 15 wrathful fire,</p>
<p>More dazzlèd and drove back his enemies</p>
<p>Than midday sun, fierce bent against their faces.</p>
<p>What should I say 16 ? His deeds exceed all speech:</p>
<p>He ne’er lift up his hand but conquerèd 17 .</p>
<p>EXETER We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood 18 ?</p>
<p>Henry is dead and never shall revive 19 :</p>
<p>Upon a wooden 20 coffin we attend,</p>
<p>And death’s dishonourable victory</p>
<p>We with our stately presence glorify,</p>
<p>Like captives bound to a triumphant car 21 .</p>
<p>What, shall we curse the planets of mishap 22 ,</p>
<p>That plotted 23 thus our glory’s overthrow?</p>
<p>Or shall we think the subtle-witted 24 French</p>
<p>Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,</p>
<p>By magic verses 25 have contrived 26 his end?</p>
<p>WINCHESTER He was a king blessed of the King of Kings 27 .</p>
<p>Unto the French the dreadful 28 judgement day</p>
<p>So dreadful will not be as was his sight.</p>
<p>The battles of the Lord of hosts 29 he fought:</p>
<p>The church’s prayers made him so prosperous 30 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER The church? Where is it? Had not churchmen prayed 31 ,</p>
<p>His thread of life 32 had not so soon decayed.</p>
<p>None do you like but an effeminate prince 33 ,</p>
<p>Whom like a schoolboy you may overawe 34 .</p>
<p>WINCHESTER Gloucester, whate’er we like, thou art Protector 35</p>
<p>And lookest 36 to command the Prince and realm.</p>
<p>Thy wife is proud: she holdeth thee in awe,</p>
<p>More than God or religious churchmen may.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Name not religion, for thou lov’st the flesh 37 ,</p>
<p>And ne’er throughout the year to church thou go’st</p>
<p>Except it be to pray against thy foes.</p>
<p>BEDFORD Cease, cease these jars 38 , and rest your minds in
peace:</p>
<p>Let’s to the altar: heralds, wait on us:</p>
<p>[Exeunt funeral procession ]</p>
<p>Instead of gold, we’ll offer up our arms:</p>
<p>Since arms avail not 39 now that Henry’s dead:</p>
<p>Posterity, await for 40 wretched years,</p>
<p>When, at their mothers’ moistened eyes, babes shall suck 41 ,</p>
<p>Our isle be made a nourish 42 of salt tears,</p>
<p>And none but women left to wail the dead.</p>
<p>Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate 43 :</p>
<p>Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils 44 ,</p>
<p>Combat with adverse planets 45 in the heavens:</p>
<p>A far more glorious star thy soul will make</p>
<p>Than Julius Caesar 46 , or bright—</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>FIRST MESSENGER My honourable lords, health to you all:</p>
<p>Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,</p>
<p>Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture 47 :</p>
<p>Guyenne, Champaigne 48 , Rouen, Rheims, Orléans,</p>
<p>Paris, Gisors, Poitiers, are all quite lost.</p>
<p>BEDFORD What say’st thou, man, before dead Henry’s corpse?</p>
<p>Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns</p>
<p>Will make him burst his lead 49 and rise from death.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Is Paris lost? Is Rouen yielded up?</p>
<p>If Henry were recalled to life again,</p>
<p>These news would cause him once more yield the ghost 50 .</p>
<p>EXETER How were they lost? What treachery was used?</p>
<p>FIRST MESSENGER No treachery, but want 51 of men and money.</p>
<p>Amongst the soldiers this is mutterèd:</p>
<p>That here you maintain several 52 factions,</p>
<p>And whilst a field 53 should be dispatched 54 and fought,</p>
<p>You are disputing of 55 your generals.</p>
<p>One would have lingering wars with little cost:</p>
<p>Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings:</p>
<p>A third thinks, without expense at all,</p>
<p>By guileful 56 fair words peace may be obtained.</p>
<p>Awake, awake, English nobility!</p>
<p>Let not sloth dim your honours new-begot 57 :</p>
<p>Cropped are the flower-de-luces 58 in your arms 59 :</p>
<p>Of England’s coat 60 , one half is cut away.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>EXETER Were our tears wanting to 61 this funeral,</p>
<p>These tidings would call forth her 62 flowing tides 63 .</p>
<p>BEDFORD Me they concern: Regent 64 I am of France:</p>
<p>Give me my steelèd coat 65 : I’ll fight for France.</p>
<p>Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!</p>
<p>He removes his mourning robes</p>
<p>Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,</p>
<p>To weep their intermissive 66 miseries.</p>
<p>Enter to them another Messenger</p>
<p>SECOND MESSENGER Lords, view these letters, full of bad mischance 67
.</p>
<p>France is revolted from the English quite 68 ,</p>
<p>Except some petty 69 towns of no import.</p>
<p>The dauphin 70 Charles is crownèd king in Rheims:</p>
<p>The Bastard 71 of Orléans with him is joined:</p>
<p>Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part:</p>
<p>The Duke of Alençon flieth to his side.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>EXETER The dauphin crownèd king! All fly 72 to him?</p>
<p>O whither shall we fly from this reproach 73 ?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER We will not fly, but to our enemies’ throats.</p>
<p>Bedford, if thou be slack, I’ll fight it out.</p>
<p>BEDFORD Gloucester, why doubt’st thou of my forwardness 74 ?</p>
<p>An army have I mustered in my thoughts,</p>
<p>Wherewith already France is overrun.</p>
<p>Enter another Messenger</p>
<p>THIRD MESSENGER My gracious lords, to add to your laments,</p>
<p>Wherewith you now bedew 75 King Henry’s hearse,</p>
<p>I must inform you of a dismal 76 fight 77</p>
<p>Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.</p>
<p>WINCHESTER What? Wherein Talbot overcame — is’t so?</p>
<p>THIRD MESSENGER O no: wherein Lord Talbot was o’erthrown:</p>
<p>The circumstance 78 I’ll tell you more at large.</p>
<p>The tenth of August 79 last, this dreadful 80 lord,</p>
<p>Retiring from the siege of Orléans,</p>
<p>Having full scarce 81 six thousand in his troop,</p>
<p>By three and twenty thousand of the French</p>
<p>Was round encompassèd 82 and set upon:</p>
<p>No leisure had he to enrank 83 his men.</p>
<p>He wanted 84 pikes 85 to set before his archers:</p>
<p>Instead whereof, sharp stakes plucked out of hedges</p>
<p>They pitchèd in the ground confusedly 86 ,</p>
<p>To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</p>
<p>More than three hours the fight continuèd,</p>
<p>Where valiant Talbot above human thought 87</p>
<p>Enacted wonders with his sword and lance.</p>
<p>Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand 88 him:</p>
<p>Here, there, and everywhere, enraged he slew.</p>
<p>The French exclaimed the devil was in arms:</p>
<p>All the whole army stood agazed on 89 him.</p>
<p>His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit</p>
<p>‘A 90 Talbot! A Talbot!’ cried out amain 91</p>
<p>And rushed into the bowels 92 of the battle.</p>
<p>Here had the conquest fully been sealed up 93 ,</p>
<p>If Sir John Falstaff 94 had not played the coward.</p>
<p>He, being in the vanguard, placed behind</p>
<p>With 95 purpose to relieve and follow them,</p>
<p>Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</p>
<p>Hence grew the general wrack 96 and massacre;</p>
<p>Enclosèd 97 were they with their enemies.</p>
<p>A base Walloon 98 , to win the dauphin’s grace 99 ,</p>
<p>Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</p>
<p>Whom all France with their chief assembled strength</p>
<p>Durst not presume to look once in the face.</p>
<p>BEDFORD Is Talbot slain then? I will slay myself,</p>
<p>For living idly here in pomp 100 and ease,</p>
<p>Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,</p>
<p>Unto his dastard foemen 101 is betrayed.</p>
<p>THIRD MESSENGER O no, he lives, but is took prisoner,</p>
<p>And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford:</p>
<p>Most of the rest slaughtered, or took likewise.</p>
<p>BEDFORD His ransom there is none but I shall pay.</p>
<p>I’ll hale 102 the dauphin headlong from his throne:</p>
<p>His crown shall be the ransom of my friend:</p>
<p>Four of their lords I’ll change 103 for one of ours.</p>
<p>Farewell, my masters: to my task will I.</p>
<p>Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,</p>
<p>To keep 104 our great Saint George’s feast 105 withal 106 .</p>
<p>Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,</p>
<p>Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.</p>
<p>THIRD MESSENGER So you had need, for Orléans is besieged.</p>
<p>The English army is grown weak and faint:</p>
<p>The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply 107 ,</p>
<p>And hardly 108 keeps his men from mutiny,</p>
<p>Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>EXETER Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn:</p>
<p>Either to quell 109 the dauphin utterly,</p>
<p>Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.</p>
<p>BEDFORD I do remember it, and here take my leave,</p>
<p>To go about my preparation.</p>
<p>Exit Bedford</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER I’ll to the Tower 110 with all the haste I can,</p>
<p>To view th’artillery and munition,</p>
<p>And then I will proclaim young Henry king.</p>
<p>Exit Gloucester</p>
<p>EXETER To Eltham 111 will I, where the young king is,</p>
<p>Being 112 ordained his special governor 113 ,</p>
<p>And for his safety there I’ll best devise.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>WINCHESTER Each hath his place and function to attend:</p>
<p>I am left out; for me nothing remains:</p>
<p>But long I will not be Jack-out-of-office 114 .</p>
<p>The king from Eltham I intend to steal</p>
<p>And sit at chiefest stern 115 of public weal 116 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
