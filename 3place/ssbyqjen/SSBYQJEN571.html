continues</h4>
<p>Enter Enobarbus, Lamprius, a Soothsayer 71 , Rannius, Lucillius,
Charmian, Iras, Mardian the Eunuch and Alexas</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost most
absolute 72 Alexas, where’s the soothsayer that you praised so to
th’queen? O, that I knew this husband which you say must charge 73 his
horns with garlands 74 !</p>
<p>ALEXAS Soothsayer.</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER Your will?</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Is this the man? Is’t you, sir, that know things?</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER In nature’s infinite book of secrecy</p>
<p>A little I can read.</p>
<p>ALEXAS Show him your hand.</p>
<p>To Charmian</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Bring in the banquet 75 quickly: wine enough Cleopatra’s
health to drink.</p>
<p>To Servants within</p>
<p>Servants bring fruit and wine</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Good sir, give me good fortune.</p>
<p>Holds out her hand</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER I make not, but foresee.</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Pray then foresee me one.</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER You shall be yet far fairer 76 than you are.</p>
<p>CHARMIAN He means in flesh.</p>
<p>IRAS No, you shall paint 77 when you are old.</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Wrinkles forbid!</p>
<p>ALEXAS Vex not his prescience 78 : be attentive.</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Hush!</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER You shall be more beloving 79 than beloved.</p>
<p>CHARMIAN I had rather heat my liver 80 with drinking.</p>
<p>ALEXAS Nay, hear him.</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Good now 81 , some excellent fortune: let me be married to
three kings in a forenoon 82 and widow them all: let me have a child at
fifty to whom Herod of Jewry 83 may do homage 84 . Find me to marry me
with Octavius Caesar and companion me with my mistress.</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.</p>
<p>CHARMIAN O, excellent! I love long life better than figs 85 .</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER You have seen and proved 86 a fairer former fortune</p>
<p>Than that which is to approach.</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Then belike 87 my children shall have no names 88 : prithee,
how many boys and wenches 89 must 90 I have?</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER If every of your wishes had a womb,</p>
<p>And fertile every wish, a million.</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Out 91 , fool! I forgive thee for a witch 92 .</p>
<p>ALEXAS You think none but your sheets are privy to 93 your
wishes.</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Nay, come, tell Iras hers.</p>
<p>ALEXAS We’ll know all our fortunes.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Mine, and most of our fortunes tonight, shall be drunk to
bed 94 .</p>
<p>IRAS There’s a palm presages 95 chastity, if nothing else.</p>
<p>Holds out her hand</p>
<p>CHARMIAN E’en as the o’erflowing Nilus presageth famine 96 .</p>
<p>IRAS Go, you wild 97 bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Nay, if an oily palm 98 be not a fruitful prognostication 99
, I cannot scratch mine ear 100 . Prithee tell her but a workaday 101
fortune.</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER Your fortunes are alike.</p>
<p>IRAS But how? But how? Give me particulars.</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER I have said 102 .</p>
<p>IRAS Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I,
where would you choose it?</p>
<p>IRAS Not in my husband’s nose 103 .</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Our worser thoughts heavens mend. Alexas — come, his
fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go 104 ,
sweet Isis 105 , I beseech thee, and let her die too, and give him a
worse, and let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow him
laughing to his grave, fifty-fold 106 a cuckold 107 ! Good Isis, hear me
this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight 108 : good
Isis, I beseech thee!</p>
<p>IRAS Amen, dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For as it is
a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived 109 , so it is a
deadly sorrow to behold a foul 110 knave 111 uncuckolded 112 :
therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum 113 and fortune him accordingly.</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Amen.</p>
<p>ALEXAS Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they
would make themselves whores, but they’d do’t 114 !</p>
<p>Enter Cleopatra</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Hush, here comes Antony.</p>
<p>CHARMIAN Not he, the queen.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Saw you my lord?</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS No, lady.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Was he not here?</p>
<p>CHARMIAN No, madam.</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA He was disposed to mirth, but on the sudden</p>
<p>A Roman thought 115 hath struck him. Enobarbus?</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Madam?</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA Seek him and bring him hither.</p>
<p>[Exit Enobarbus ]</p>
<p>Where’s Alexas?</p>
<p>ALEXAS Here, at your service. My lord approaches.</p>
<p>Enter Antony with a Messenger</p>
<p>CLEOPATRA We 116 will not look upon him: go with us.</p>
<p>Exeunt. [Antony and Messenger remain ]</p>
<p>MESSENGER Fulvia thy wife first came into the field 117 .</p>
<p>ANTONY Against my brother Lucius?</p>
<p>MESSENGER Ay,</p>
<p>But soon that war had end, and the time’s state 118</p>
<p>Made friends of them, jointing their force 119 gainst Caesar,</p>
<p>Whose better issue 120 in the war from Italy</p>
<p>Upon the first encounter 121 , drave them 122 .</p>
<p>ANTONY Well, what worst?</p>
<p>MESSENGER The nature of bad news infects the teller.</p>
<p>ANTONY When it concerns the fool or coward. On!</p>
<p>Things that are past are done with me. ’Tis thus:</p>
<p>Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,</p>
<p>I hear him as he flattered 123 .</p>
<p>MESSENGER Labienus 124 —</p>
<p>This is stiff 125 news — hath with his Parthian 126 force</p>
<p>Extended 127 Asia: from Euphrates 128</p>
<p>His conquering banner shook, from Syria</p>
<p>To Lydia 129 and to Ionia 130 , whilst—</p>
<p>ANTONY Antony, thou wouldst 131 say.</p>
<p>MESSENGER O, my lord!</p>
<p>ANTONY Speak to me home 132 , mince not the general tongue 133 ,</p>
<p>Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome,</p>
<p>Rail thou in Fulvia’s phrase 134 , and taunt my faults</p>
<p>With such full licence as both truth and malice</p>
<p>Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds</p>
<p>When our quick 135 minds lie still 136 , and our ills told us</p>
<p>Is as our earing 137 . Fare thee well awhile.</p>
<p>MESSENGER At your noble pleasure.</p>
<p>Exit Messenger</p>
<p>Enter another Messenger</p>
<p>ANTONY From Sicyon 138 how 139 the news? Speak there.</p>
<p>SECOND MESSENGER The man from Sicyon—</p>
<p>ANTONY Is there such an one?</p>
<p>SECOND MESSENGER He stays upon your will 140 .</p>
<p>ANTONY Let him appear.—</p>
<p>[Exit Second Messenger ]</p>
<p>These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,</p>
<p>Or lose myself in dotage.—</p>
<p>Enter another Messenger with a letter</p>
<p>What 141 are you?</p>
<p>THIRD MESSENGER Fulvia thy wife is dead.</p>
<p>ANTONY Where died she?</p>
<p>THIRD MESSENGER In Sicyon.</p>
<p>Her length of sickness, with what else more serious</p>
<p>Importeth 142 thee to know, this bears.</p>
<p>Gives him the letter</p>
<p>ANTONY Forbear me 143 .—</p>
<p>[Exit Third Messenger ]</p>
<p>There’s a great spirit gone. Thus did I desire it:</p>
<p>What our contempts doth often hurl from us</p>
<p>We wish it ours again 144 . The present pleasure,</p>
<p>By revolution low’ring 145 , does become</p>
<p>The opposite of itself. She’s good, being gone.</p>
<p>The hand could 146 pluck her back that shoved her on.</p>
<p>I must from this enchanting 147 queen break off:</p>
<p>Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,</p>
<p>My idleness 148 doth hatch.—</p>
<p>Enter Enobarbus</p>
<p>How now, Enobarbus?</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS What’s your pleasure, sir?</p>
<p>ANTONY I must with haste from hence.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Why, then, we kill all our women. We see how mortal 149 an
unkindness is to them: if they suffer 150 our departure, death’s the
word.</p>
<p>ANTONY I must be gone.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Under a compelling occasion, let women die 151 . It were
pity to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great
cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least
noise 152 of this, dies instantly: I have seen her die twenty times upon
far poorer moment 153 . I do think there is mettle 154 in death which
commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity 155 in
dying.</p>
<p>ANTONY She is cunning 156 past man’s thought.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Alack, sir, no: her passions are made of nothing but the
finest part 157 of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs
and tears: they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs 158 can
report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a shower of
rain as well as Jove 159 .</p>
<p>ANTONY Would 160 I had never seen her.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS O sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work
161 , which not to have been blest withal 162 would have discredited
your travel 163 .</p>
<p>ANTONY Fulvia is dead.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Sir?</p>
<p>ANTONY Fulvia is dead.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Fulvia?</p>
<p>ANTONY Dead.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it
pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to
man the tailors of the earth 164 : comforting therein 165 , that when
old robes are worn out, there are members 166 to make new. If there were
no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut 167 , and the case
168 to be lamented. This grief is crowned 169 with consolation 170 :
your old smock 171 brings forth a new petticoat 172 , and indeed the
tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.</p>
<p>ANTONY The business 173 she hath broachèd in the state</p>
<p>Cannot endure my absence.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS And the business you have broached 174 here cannot be
without you, especially that of Cleopatra’s, which wholly depends on
your abode 175 .</p>
<p>ANTONY No more light 176 answers. Let our officers</p>
<p>Have notice what we purpose. I shall break</p>
<p>The cause of our expedience 177 to the queen,</p>
<p>And get her leave to part 178 . For not alone 179</p>
<p>The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches 180 ,</p>
<p>Do strongly speak to us, but the letters too</p>
<p>Of many our contriving 181 friends in Rome</p>
<p>Petition us at home 182 . Sextus Pompeius 183</p>
<p>Hath given the dare to 184 Caesar and commands</p>
<p>The empire of the sea. Our slippery 185 people,</p>
<p>Whose love is never linked to the deserver</p>
<p>Till his deserts are past, begin to throw 186</p>
<p>Pompey the Great 187 and all his dignities 188</p>
<p>Upon his son, who, high 189 in name and power,</p>
<p>Higher than both in blood and life 190 , stands up</p>
<p>For 191 the main 192 soldier, whose quality 193 going on 194 ,</p>
<p>The sides o’th’world may danger 195 . Much is breeding</p>
<p>Which, like the courser’s hair, hath yet but life</p>
<p>And not a serpent’s poison 196 . Say our pleasure,</p>
<p>To such whose place is under us, requires</p>
<p>Our quick remove from hence 197 .</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS I shall do’t.</p>
<p>[Exeunt separately ]</p>
