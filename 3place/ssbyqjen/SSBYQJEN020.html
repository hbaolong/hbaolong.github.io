<h4 id="introduction-to-the-two-gentlemen-of-verona">Introduction to The
Two Gentlemen of Verona</h4>
<p>The Two Gentlemen of Verona is one of Shakespeare’s early plays,
perhaps even his first. We do not know exactly when it was written or
first performed, but its stylistic and dramatic features distinguish it
as early work: a small cast, a preponderance of end-stopped verse lines,
a degree of simplicity in both language and characterization. Though the
play has the relative superficiality of youth, it also has the virtues
of that time of life: freshness, energy, pace, wholeheartedness, a
desire to get to the point and to speak its mind. It is about the things
that matter most urgently to young people: themselves, their friendships
and their love affairs. It makes its drama out of the conflicts between
these things: how can you be simultaneously true to yourself, to your
best friend and to the object of your sexual desire? Especially if the
person you’ve fallen in love with happens to be your best friend’s
girlfriend.</p>
<p>In all sorts of ways, The Two Gentlemen is a prototype for later
Shakespearean developments. The cross-dressed heroine recurs in the more
renowned comedies of the late 1590s and early 1600s. The outlaw scenes
introduce a movement out from ‘civil’ society into a ‘wilderness’ or
green world, where surprising developments take place, anticipating the
enchanted wood of A Midsummer Night’s Dream and the forest of Arden in
As You Like It . The soliloquies of Proteus, meanwhile, offer an early
example of a Shakespearean character undergoing a crisis of personal
identity, of consciousness - already we are moving into the territory
that will be taken in very different (and of course much more complex)
directions in the self-communion of Richard III, Richard II and
eventually Hamlet.</p>
<p>The play begins by establishing the friendship between the two
gentlemen. Valentine’s name suggests the patron saint of lovers in the
Christian tradition, while that of Proteus evokes the shape-changing god
of the classical tradition. The names are enough to suggest that
Valentine will be the constant lover, Proteus the fickle one. Initially,
though, Valentine is associated with the pursuit of ‘honour’ rather than
sexual desire. He intends to seek his fortune in the city of Milan
instead of ‘living dully sluggardized at home’. His plan would
immediately have pricked the interest of many members of the play’s
original London audience, who would themselves have made the journey
from the provinces to the capital - as indeed Shakespeare had done
himself not long before writing the play.</p>
<p>Proteus, meanwhile, has undergone a psychological rather than a
physical journey: he has left himself, his friends, and all, for love.
His desire for Julia has ‘metamorphosed’ him and made him neglect his
studies, waste his time and go to ‘war with good counsel’. The didactic
literature of the age was full of admonitions against such self-abuse.
Young gentlemen were supposed to study the arts of good behaviour and
good citizenship, not to be distracted by affairs of the heart and
effeminizing influences. Stage plays came into the latter category,
which partially accounts for the anti-theatrical diatribes of
Elizabethan ‘puritans’.</p>
<p>The opening also establishes oppositions between generations and
genders. Shakespeare then sets up a dialogue across the barrier of class
by means of witty banter between master and servant. Valentine’s servant
Speed is there to anatomize the characteristics of the mooning courtly
lover: he observes his master folding his arms like a melancholy
malcontent, relishing love songs, walking alone, sighing like a
schoolboy who knows he’s going to be in trouble for losing his spelling
book, weeping, speaking in a whining voice and rejecting food like
someone on a diet. Much as the play celebrates the transforming energies
of young love - and indeed engages with its destructive potential - it
also mocks the courtly idiom of love-language, not least through the
contrast between the artificial poeticisms of the genteel characters and
the robust prose voice of their servants.</p>
<p>The name Speed suggests the quickness of wit that is confirmed by
this servant’s linguistic facility and awareness of the gentlemen’s
foibles. He always seems to be one step ahead of Valentine, anticipating
what his master’s going to do next in an aside shared with the audience.
Proteus’ servant Lance also has a name that suggests mental sharpness:
Shakespeare himself was often praised by his contemporaries for having a
wit that was as sharp as the spear in his name. Ironically, though,
Lance’s way of proceeding is anything but pointed: his role is that of
the clown for whom everything goes wrong and who confuses his words
(‘the prodigious son’ for the prodigal son, ‘a notable lover’ misheard
as ‘a notable lubber’). When he tries to use his shoe, his staff, his
hat and his dog to act out the scene of his farewell from his family, he
gets into a terrible tangle. The joke is that this should be as a result
of the unpredictability of the live dog on stage, but actually it is due
to Lance’s own incompetence. At the end of the fourth act, Lance has a
second two-hander with his dog, a riff on the theme of a servant’s
obedience to his master. As Lance makes a mess of the demands of
Proteus, so Crab fails to do the will of Lance: ‘Did not I bid thee
still mark me, and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave up my leg
and make water against a gentlewoman’s farthingale?’</p>
<p>While Speed mocks Valentine’s transformation into a lover, Lance
succumbs to desire in the manner of his master. He falls in love with a
milkmaid, the unseen prototype of the hoyden charactertype that will be
incarnated in the fat kitchen-maid of The Comedy of Errors and As You
Like It’ s goatherd Audrey. Lance’s catalogue of the milkmaid’s
down-to-earth virtues and vices parodies the courtly lover’s enumeration
of the beauties of his mistress.</p>
<p>Silvia is the beautiful lady of courtly romance, the object of men’s
devoted gaze and fantastic desire, a woman on a pedestal who reveals
little of her inner life. Julia, by contrast, wears her heart upon her
sleeve as she moves from domesticity to danger when she sets off in
pursuit of Proteus. Her decision to do so reveals the sexual double
standard that was pervasive in Shakespeare’s time: whereas a young man
is condemned for sluggardizing at home, a young woman risks being made
the object of scandal by setting out from home.</p>
<p>One of Shakespeare’s favourite techniques was the dramatically ironic
counterpointing of scenes: we see Julia proving her love for Proteus by
setting off on her dangerous journey immediately after we have seen
Proteus renouncing his love for Julia because he has been smitten by the
sight of Silvia. The scene when Valentine introduces his best friend to
the girl he has fallen in love with is brief but very subtly written. It
turns on the correspondence between the language of courtesy and that of
courtship. Valentine asks Silvia to welcome Proteus ‘with some special
favour’ and to ‘entertain him’ in her service. What he means is ‘please
treat my friend with respect’, but since in the courtly idiom the
language of service is synonymous with that of love, Proteus is given an
opening to project himself into the role of a rival lover - when Silvia
modestly refers to herself as a ‘worthless mistress’ he responds by
saying that he would fight to the death anyone else who described her
thus. In a sense, the crux of the play lies in the double meaning of the
word ‘mistress’.</p>
<p>Proteus explores his own transformation in two soliloquies that come
in rapid succession. In the first, he introduces the image of his love
for Julia as akin to a wax image melted to oblivion by the heat of his
new desire for Silvia. At the same time, he recognizes that what he has
fallen in love with is merely a ‘picture,’ the outer image of her
beauty. The play begins to probe more deeply into the nature of love
when in later scenes a series of questions are asked about the
relationship between the ‘shadow’ of surface beauty and the ‘substance’
or ‘essence’ of personality within. In parallel with this motif, the
action develops the concerns of Proteus’ second major soliloquy: making
and breaking vows, finding and losing selves, and the conflict between
‘sweet-suggesting love’ and ‘the law of friendship’. ‘In love’, Proteus
asks at the play’s crisis point, ‘Who respects friend?’</p>
<p>Prior to the last few years of Shakespeare’s career, his plays were
performed without an interval. Despite this, there is often a
perceptible change in the action at the beginning of the fourth act. The
plot has been wound to the full, so now the unwinding begins. Here the
turning point is marked by the movement away from court and city to a
wood peopled by some rather genteel outlaws. One of them swears ‘By the
bare scalp of Robin Hood’s fat friar’ and it is the jolly camaraderie of
the Merry Men, stripped of the old story’s violence and political edge,
that is evoked by these outlaws.</p>
<p>Desire feeds itself on rejection. The more Silvia spurns Proteus, the
more he desires her. By the same account, the more he spurns Julia, the
more she dotes on him. In the play’s richest sequence, music is
introduced to establish a nocturnal setting in which Proteus displaces
Turio and woos Silvia at her window, not knowing that he is overheard by
Julia in her pageboy disguise: this is her dark night of the soul. But
then in a bold and very Shakespearean twist, when Proteus confronts the
disguised Julia face to face he takes rather a fancy to her boy-self:
‘Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well, / And will employ thee in some
service presently.’ The words ‘employ’ and ‘service’ maintain the
punning on the shared language of domestic obligation and sexual
engagement. Anticipating Viola in Twelfth Night , Julia finds herself in
the painful position of being ‘servant’ to the man whose ‘mistress’ she
really wants to be. Hitherto Proteus has regarded Julia as nothing more
than a decorative blonde. Now that he thinks she is Sebastian, he
unwittingly begins to intuit her inner qualities.</p>
<p>At this point, the play reaches its highest point of sophistication
and self-conscious artfulness. The audience is offered two images: a
portrait of Silvia and a description of Sebastian, dressed in Julia’s
clothes, playing the part of a rejected lover, Ariadne deserted by
Theseus in a famous story from classical mythology. The contrast between
the two images effectively turns the scene into a Shakespearean claim
for the superiority not only of the player’s art to the portrait
painter’s but also of his own dramatization of love to the static vision
of courtly romance. The painting, like the lady of romance, is but a
‘senseless form’ to be ‘worshipped, kissed, loved, and adored’. The
actor, by contrast, can evoke the real pain of passion so convincingly
(‘so lively acted’) that the audience may be moved to tears. No one is
better than Proteus at expressing eternal adoration in the artful
language - all sighs and poetic hyperbole - of the courtly lover, but
his fickleness reveals the essential insincerity of the code.
Paradoxically, it is the play-actor who is truly sincere: ‘Sebastian’ is
really Julia, passioning not for Theseus’ but for Proteus’ perjury and
unjust flight.</p>
<p>Painters can achieve tricks of the eye - perspectival illusions of
depth, anamorphic representations that vary in appearance according to
where the viewer stands - but the theatrical imagination can do much
more: the imagined performance of Sebastian as Ariadne is mapped on to
the achieved performance of both Julia as Sebastian in the world of the
play and the boy-actor as Julia on the stage where the drama was first
brought to life. Throughout his career, Shakespeare will return to such
complex layered effects of illusion and reality, in accordance with his
core belief that we are all players in the great theatre of the
world.</p>
<p>Having gone emotionally deep in the fourth act, Shakespeare speeds
towards a conventional comic conclusion in the fifth. The forest of the
jolly outlaws is his device for doing so. It is not a psychologically
complex environment, like the wood in A Midsummer Night’s Dream .
Rather, it is a place where the polished veneer of civil society is
stripped away, allowing people to act impulsively on their desires.
Psychological consistency is not the point here: one moment Proteus is
threatening to rape Silvia, the next Valentine is seeking to demonstrate
that he values gentlemanly friendship above erotic desire by offering
Silvia to Proteus. We do get the ending we expect and desire, but the
abruptness with which it comes about is a sign of impatience or
immaturity on Shakespeare’s part - but then again, his mind was so
restlessly inventive that he never really cared for endings.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Valentine sets off from Verona for Milan to see the world.
Proteus stays at home because of his love for Julia. She is in love with
him, but neither knows of the other’s love until Lucetta shows Julia a
love letter from Proteus. He is reading her reply when his father,
Antonio, informs him of his decision to send him to the duke’s court to
join Valentine. The lovers take their leave and swear eternal constancy.
In Milan, Proteus finds that Valentine has fallen in love with Silvia,
the duke’s daughter, and plans to elope with her to foil her father’s
plan to marry her to Turio. Valentine confides his plan to his friend
but Proteus, infatuated with Silvia at first sight, betrays the plan to
the duke and Valentine is banished from Milan. In the wilderness he
encounters a band of outlaws and is elected their leader. Meanwhile
Julia, disguised as Sebastian, has come to Milan in search of Proteus.
Overhearing him declare his passion for Silvia, she is devastated but,
under cover of her disguise, enters his service as a page. When Proteus
sends her with a message to Silvia, Julia is encouraged to find that his
advances are again rejected and that Silvia remains faithful to
Valentine. Silvia escapes into the forest to join Valentine. The duke
and Turio set out in pursuit, followed by Proteus and Julia. Silvia is
captured by the outlaws but then rescued by Proteus who, seeing that she
still spurns him, tries to force himself on her. Valentine intervenes
and Proteus is forced to confront his act of betrayal. Julia reveals her
identity and a reconciliation begins.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on

<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 80% verse, 20% prose. High frequency of rhyme.</p>
<p>DATE: Early 1590s. Mentioned by Francis Meres in 1598. Presumed on
stylistic grounds to be one of the earliest plays, but no firm evidence
for any particular year.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Main plot based on a story in Jorge de Montemayor, Diana
Enamorada (originally in Spanish - English translation by Bartholomew
Yong published 1598, but circulated in manuscript several years
earlier); plot may be mediated via a lost Queen’s Men play of the 1580s,
Felix and Feliomena . Other literary influences seem to include Arthur
Brooke, Romeus and Juliet (1562) and John Lyly, Euphues (1578) and
perhaps Midas (c.1589).</p>
<p>TEXT: First Folio of 1623 is the only early printed text. Based on a
transcript by Ralph Crane, professional scribe working for the King’s
Men. Generally good quality of printing.</p>
