<h4 id="scene-2-49-running-scene-2">Scene 2 49 ／running scene 2</h4>
<p>Enter Prospero 50 and Miranda 51</p>
<p>MIRANDA If by your art 52 , my dearest father, you have</p>
<p>Put the wild waters in this roar, allay 53 them.</p>
<p>The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch 54 ,</p>
<p>But that the sea, mounting to th’welkin’s 55 cheek,</p>
<p>Dashes the fire 56 out. O, I have suffered</p>
<p>With those that I saw suffer: a brave 57 vessel —</p>
<p>Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her —</p>
<p>Dashed all to pieces. O, the cry did knock</p>
<p>Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perished.</p>
<p>Had I been any god of power, I would</p>
<p>Have sunk the sea within the earth, or ere 58</p>
<p>It should the good ship so have swallowed, and</p>
<p>The fraughting souls 59 within her.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Be collected 60 :</p>
<p>No more amazement 61 . Tell your piteous heart</p>
<p>There’s no harm done.</p>
<p>MIRANDA O, woe the day!</p>
<p>PROSPERO No harm:</p>
<p>I have done nothing but in care of thee —</p>
<p>Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter — who</p>
<p>Art ignorant of what thou art: nought knowing</p>
<p>Of whence I am 62 , nor that I am more better 63</p>
<p>Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell 64 ,</p>
<p>And thy no greater father 65 .</p>
<p>MIRANDA More to know 66</p>
<p>Did never meddle with 67 my thoughts.</p>
<p>PROSPERO ’Tis time</p>
<p>I should inform thee further. Lend thy hand</p>
<p>And pluck my magic garment from me. So:</p>
<p>Lays down his magic cloak</p>
<p>Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes, have comfort.</p>
<p>The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touched</p>
<p>The very virtue of compassion in thee,</p>
<p>I have with such provision 68 in mine art</p>
<p>So safely ordered that there is no soul —</p>
<p>No, not so much perdition 69 as an hair</p>
<p>Betid 70 to any creature in the vessel</p>
<p>Which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit down,</p>
<p>Miranda sits</p>
<p>For thou must now know further.</p>
<p>MIRANDA You have often</p>
<p>Begun to tell me what I am, but stopped</p>
<p>And left me to a bootless inquisition 71 ,</p>
<p>Concluding ‘Stay: not yet.’</p>
<p>PROSPERO The hour’s now come,</p>
<p>The very minute bids thee ope 72 thine ear:</p>
<p>Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember</p>
<p>A time before we came unto this cell?</p>
<p>I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not</p>
<p>Out 73 three years old.</p>
<p>MIRANDA Certainly, sir, I can.</p>
<p>PROSPERO By what? By any other house or person?</p>
<p>Of any thing the image, tell me, that</p>
<p>Hath kept with thy remembrance 74 .</p>
<p>MIRANDA ’Tis far off,</p>
<p>And rather like a dream than an assurance 75</p>
<p>That my remembrance warrants 76 . Had I not</p>
<p>Four or five women once that tended 77 me?</p>
<p>PROSPERO Thou hadst; and more, Miranda. But how is it</p>
<p>That this lives in thy mind? What see’st thou else</p>
<p>In the dark backward 78 and abysm 79 of time?</p>
<p>If thou rememb’rest aught 80 ere thou cam’st here,</p>
<p>How thou cam’st here thou mayst.</p>
<p>MIRANDA But that I do not.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,</p>
<p>Thy father was the Duke of Milan and</p>
<p>A prince of power.</p>
<p>MIRANDA Sir, are not you my father?</p>
<p>PROSPERO Thy mother was a piece 81 of virtue, and</p>
<p>She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father</p>
<p>Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir</p>
<p>And princess, no worse issued 82 .</p>
<p>MIRANDA O the heavens!</p>
<p>What foul play had we, that we came from thence?</p>
<p>Or blessèd 83 wast we did?</p>
<p>PROSPERO Both, both, my girl.</p>
<p>By foul play — as thou say’st — were we heaved thence,</p>
<p>But blessedly holp 84 hither.</p>
<p>MIRANDA O, my heart bleeds</p>
<p>To think o’th’teen 85 that I have turned you to 86 ,</p>
<p>Which is from 87 my remembrance. Please you, further.</p>
<p>PROSPERO My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio —</p>
<p>I pray thee, mark 88 me — that a brother should</p>
<p>Be so perfidious 89 — he whom next thyself</p>
<p>Of all the world I loved, and to him put</p>
<p>The manage 90 of my state, as at that time</p>
<p>Through all the signories 91 it was the first,</p>
<p>And Prospero the prime 92 duke, being so reputed</p>
<p>In dignity, and for the liberal arts 93</p>
<p>Without a parallel; those being all my study,</p>
<p>The government I cast upon my brother</p>
<p>And to my state 94 grew stranger 95 , being transported</p>
<p>And rapt 96 in secret studies. Thy false uncle —</p>
<p>Dost thou attend me?</p>
<p>MIRANDA Sir, most heedfully.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Being once perfected 97 how to grant suits 98 ,</p>
<p>How to deny them, who t’advance and who</p>
<p>To trash for over-topping 99 , new created</p>
<p>The creatures that were mine 100 , I say, or changed ’em 101 ,</p>
<p>Or else new formed ’em 102 ; having both the key 103</p>
<p>Of officer and office, set all hearts i’th’state</p>
<p>To what tune pleased his ear, that 104 now he was</p>
<p>The ivy which had hid my princely trunk 105</p>
<p>And sucked my verdure 106 out on’t.— Thou attend’st not.</p>
<p>MIRANDA O good sir, I do.</p>
<p>PROSPERO I pray thee, mark me:</p>
<p>I, thus neglecting worldly ends 107 , all dedicated</p>
<p>To closeness 108 and the bettering of my mind</p>
<p>With that, which but 109 by being so retired 110 ,</p>
<p>O’er-prized all popular rate 111 , in my false brother</p>
<p>Awaked an evil nature, and my trust,</p>
<p>Like a good parent 112 , did beget of 113 him</p>
<p>A falsehood in its contrary 114 , as great</p>
<p>As my trust was, which had indeed no limit,</p>
<p>A confidence sans 115 bound. He being thus lorded 116 ,</p>
<p>Not only with what my revenue yielded,</p>
<p>But what my power might else exact 117 : like one</p>
<p>Who having into 118 truth, by telling of it 119 ,</p>
<p>Made such a sinner of his memory</p>
<p>To credit his own lie 120 , he did believe</p>
<p>He was indeed the duke, out o’th’substitution 121</p>
<p>And executing th’outward face 122 of royalty</p>
<p>With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing —</p>
<p>Dost thou hear?</p>
<p>MIRANDA Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.</p>
<p>PROSPERO To have no screen 123 between this part he played,</p>
<p>And him 124 he played it for, he needs will be</p>
<p>Absolute Milan 125 . Me — poor man — my library</p>
<p>Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties 126</p>
<p>He thinks me now incapable. Confederates 127 —</p>
<p>So dry 128 he was for sway 129 — wi’th’King of Naples</p>
<p>To give him annual tribute 130 , do him homage,</p>
<p>Subject his coronet to his crown 131 , and bend</p>
<p>The dukedom yet 132 unbowed — alas, poor Milan —</p>
<p>To most ignoble stooping.</p>
<p>MIRANDA O the heavens!</p>
<p>PROSPERO Mark his condition 133 and th’event 134 , then tell me</p>
<p>If this might be a brother 135 .</p>
<p>MIRANDA I should sin</p>
<p>To think but 136 nobly of my grandmother:</p>
<p>Good wombs have borne bad sons.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Now the condition.</p>
<p>This King of Naples, being an enemy</p>
<p>To me inveterate 137 , hearkens 138 my brother’s suit,</p>
<p>Which was, that he 139 , in lieu o’th’premises</p>
<p>Of homage 140 , and I know not how much tribute 141 ,</p>
<p>Should presently extirpate 142 me and mine</p>
<p>Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,</p>
<p>With all the honours, on my brother: whereon,</p>
<p>A treacherous army levied, one midnight</p>
<p>Fated to th’purpose, did Antonio open</p>
<p>The gates of Milan, and i’th’dead of darkness</p>
<p>The ministers 143 for th’purpose hurried thence 144</p>
<p>Me and thy crying self.</p>
<p>MIRANDA Alack, for pity!</p>
<p>I, not rememb’ring how I cried out then,</p>
<p>Will cry it o’er again: it is a hint 145</p>
<p>That wrings mine eyes to’t.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Hear a little further,</p>
<p>And then I’ll bring thee to the present business</p>
<p>Which now’s upon’s: without the which, this story</p>
<p>Were most impertinent 146 .</p>
<p>MIRANDA Wherefore did they not</p>
<p>That hour destroy us?</p>
<p>PROSPERO Well demanded, wench:</p>
<p>My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst 147 not,</p>
<p>So dear the love my people bore me: nor set</p>
<p>A mark so bloody on the business: but</p>
<p>With colours fairer, painted 148 their foul ends.</p>
<p>In few 149 , they hurried us aboard a barque 150 ,</p>
<p>Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared</p>
<p>A rotten carcass of a butt 151 , not rigged,</p>
<p>Nor tackle, sail, nor mast: the very rats</p>
<p>Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist 152 us,</p>
<p>To cry to th’sea that roared to us; to sigh</p>
<p>To th’winds, whose pity sighing back again,</p>
<p>Did us but loving wrong 153 .</p>
<p>MIRANDA Alack, what trouble</p>
<p>Was I then to you!</p>
<p>PROSPERO O, a cherubin 154</p>
<p>Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,</p>
<p>Infusèd with a fortitude from heaven,</p>
<p>When I have decked 155 the sea with drops full salt 156 ,</p>
<p>Under my burden groaned, which 157 raised in me</p>
<p>An undergoing stomach 158 , to bear up</p>
<p>Against what should ensue.</p>
<p>MIRANDA How came we ashore?</p>
<p>Prospero sits</p>
<p>PROSPERO By providence divine.</p>
<p>Some food we had, and some fresh water, that</p>
<p>A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,</p>
<p>Out of his charity — who being then appointed</p>
<p>Master of this design 159 — did give us, with</p>
<p>Rich garments, linens, stuffs 160 and necessaries,</p>
<p>Which since have steaded much 161 . So, of his gentleness 162 ,</p>
<p>Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me</p>
<p>From mine own library with volumes that</p>
<p>I prize above my dukedom.</p>
<p>MIRANDA Would 163 I might</p>
<p>But ever see that man.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Now I arise:</p>
<p>Prospero stands</p>
<p>Sit still 164 , and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.</p>
<p>Here in this island we arrived, and here</p>
<p>Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit 165</p>
<p>Than other princes can that have more time</p>
<p>For vainer 166 hours, and tutors not so careful 167 .</p>
<p>MIRANDA Heavens thank you for’t. And now, I pray you, sir,</p>
<p>For still ’tis beating in my mind: your reason</p>
<p>For raising this sea-storm?</p>
<p>PROSPERO Know thus far forth:</p>
<p>By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune —</p>
<p>Now my dear lady 168 — hath mine enemies</p>
<p>Brought to this shore: and by my prescience 169</p>
<p>I find my zenith 170 doth depend upon</p>
<p>A most auspicious star, whose influence 171</p>
<p>If now I court not, but omit 172 , my fortunes</p>
<p>Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:</p>
<p>Thou art inclined to sleep. ’Tis a good dullness 173 ,</p>
<p>And give it way 174 : I know thou canst not choose.—</p>
<p>Miranda sleeps</p>
<p>Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.</p>
<p>Approach, my Ariel 175 , come.</p>
<p>Enter Ariel</p>
<p>ARIEL All hail, great master! Grave 176 sir, hail! I come</p>
<p>To answer thy best pleasure; be’t to fly,</p>
<p>To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride</p>
<p>On the curled clouds: to thy strong bidding task 177</p>
<p>Ariel and all his quality 178 .</p>
<p>PROSPERO Hast thou, spirit,</p>
<p>Performed to point 179 the tempest that I bade thee?</p>
<p>ARIEL To every article.</p>
<p>I boarded the king’s ship: now on the beak 180 ,</p>
<p>Now in the waist 181 , the deck, in every cabin,</p>
<p>I flamed amazement 182 : sometime I’d divide</p>
<p>And burn in many places; on the topmast,</p>
<p>The yards 183 and bowsprit 184 would I flame distinctly,</p>
<p>Then meet and join. Jove’s lightning, the precursors</p>
<p>O’th’dreadful thunderclaps 185 , more momentary</p>
<p>And sight-outrunning 186 were not; the fire and cracks</p>
<p>Of sulphurous roaring, the most mighty Neptune 187</p>
<p>Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,</p>
<p>Yea, his dread trident 188 shake.</p>
<p>PROSPERO My brave spirit!</p>
<p>Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil 189</p>
<p>Would not infect his reason?</p>
<p>ARIEL Not a soul</p>
<p>But felt a fever of the mad 190 and played</p>
<p>Some tricks of desperation 191 . All but mariners</p>
<p>Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,</p>
<p>Then all afire 192 with me: the king’s son, Ferdinand,</p>
<p>With hair up-staring 193 — then like reeds, not hair —</p>
<p>Was the first man that leaped; cried ’Hell is empty</p>
<p>And all the devils are here.’</p>
<p>PROSPERO Why, that’s my spirit!</p>
<p>But was not this nigh 194 shore?</p>
<p>ARIEL Close by, my master.</p>
<p>PROSPERO But are they, Ariel, safe?</p>
<p>ARIEL Not a hair perished:</p>
<p>On their sustaining 195 garments not a blemish,</p>
<p>But fresher than before: and, as thou bad’st me,</p>
<p>In troops 196 I have dispersed them ’bout the isle.</p>
<p>The king’s son have I landed by himself,</p>
<p>Whom I left cooling of 197 the air with sighs</p>
<p>In an odd angle 198 of the isle, and sitting,</p>
<p>His arms in this sad knot 199 .</p>
<p>Folds his arms</p>
<p>PROSPERO Of the king’s ship,</p>
<p>The mariners, say how thou hast disposed,</p>
<p>And all the rest o’th’fleet?</p>
<p>ARIEL Safely in harbour</p>
<p>Is the king’s ship: in the deep nook where once</p>
<p>Thou call’dst me up at midnight to fetch dew 200</p>
<p>From the still-vexed Bermudas 201 , there she’s hid;</p>
<p>The mariners all under hatches 202 stowed,</p>
<p>Who, with a charm 203 joined to their suffered labour 204 ,</p>
<p>I have left asleep: and for the rest o’th’fleet —</p>
<p>Which I dispersed — they all have met again,</p>
<p>And are upon the Mediterranean float 205</p>
<p>Bound sadly home for Naples,</p>
<p>Supposing that they saw the king’s ship wrecked</p>
<p>And his great person perish.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Ariel, thy charge</p>
<p>Exactly is performed; but there’s more work:</p>
<p>What is the time o’th’day?</p>
<p>ARIEL Past the mid season 206 .</p>
<p>PROSPERO At least two glasses 207 . The time ’twixt six and now</p>
<p>Must by us both be spent most preciously 208 .</p>
<p>ARIEL Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains 209 ,</p>
<p>Let me remember 210 thee what thou hast promised,</p>
<p>Which is not yet performed me.</p>
<p>PROSPERO How now? Moody 211 ?</p>
<p>What is’t thou canst demand?</p>
<p>ARIEL My liberty.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Before the time be out 212 ? No more!</p>
<p>ARIEL I prithee,</p>
<p>Remember I have done thee worthy service,</p>
<p>Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served</p>
<p>Without or 213 grudge or grumblings: thou did promise</p>
<p>To bate me 214 a full year.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Dost thou forget</p>
<p>From what a torment I did free thee?</p>
<p>ARIEL No.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Thou dost: and think’st it much to tread the ooze</p>
<p>Of the salt deep 215 ,</p>
<p>To run upon the sharp wind of the north,</p>
<p>To do me business in the veins o’th’earth</p>
<p>When it is baked with frost.</p>
<p>ARIEL I do not, sir.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Thou liest, malignant thing. Hast thou forgot</p>
<p>The foul witch Sycorax 216 , who with age and envy</p>
<p>Was grown into a hoop 217 ? Hast thou forgot her?</p>
<p>ARIEL No, sir.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Thou hast. Where was she born? Speak: tell me.</p>
<p>ARIEL Sir, in Algiers 218 .</p>
<p>PROSPERO O, was she so? I must</p>
<p>Once in a month recount what thou hast been,</p>
<p>Which thou forget’st. This damned witch Sycorax,</p>
<p>For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible</p>
<p>To enter human hearing, from Algiers,</p>
<p>Thou know’st, was banished: for one thing she did</p>
<p>They would not take her life 219 . Is not this true?</p>
<p>ARIEL Ay, sir.</p>
<p>PROSPERO This blue-eyed 220 hag 221 was hither brought with child 222
,</p>
<p>And here was left by th’sailors. Thou, my slave,</p>
<p>As thou report’st thyself, was then her servant:</p>
<p>And, for 223 thou wast a spirit too delicate 224</p>
<p>To act her earthy 225 and abhorred commands,</p>
<p>Refusing her grand hests 226 , she did confine thee</p>
<p>By help of her more potent ministers 227 ,</p>
<p>And in her most unmitigable 228 rage,</p>
<p>Into a cloven 229 pine, within which rift</p>
<p>Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain</p>
<p>A dozen years: within which space she died,</p>
<p>And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans</p>
<p>As fast as mill-wheels strike 230 . Then was this island —</p>
<p>Save for the son that she did litter 231 here,</p>
<p>A freckled whelp 232 , hag-born 233 — not honoured with</p>
<p>A human shape.</p>
<p>ARIEL Yes: Caliban 234 her son.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Dull thing 235 , I say so: he, that Caliban</p>
<p>Whom now I keep in service 236 . Thou best know’st</p>
<p>What torment I did find thee in: thy groans</p>
<p>Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts</p>
<p>Of ever-angry bears 237 ; it was a torment</p>
<p>To lay upon the damned, which Sycorax</p>
<p>Could not again undo. It was mine art,</p>
<p>When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape 238</p>
<p>The pine and let thee out.</p>
<p>ARIEL I thank thee, master.</p>
<p>PROSPERO If thou more murmur’st 239 , I will rend 240 an oak</p>
<p>And peg 241 thee in his knotty entrails 242 till</p>
<p>Thou hast howled away twelve winters.</p>
<p>ARIEL Pardon, master:</p>
<p>I will be correspondent 243 to command</p>
<p>And do my spriting 244 gently 245 .</p>
<p>PROSPERO Do so: and after two days</p>
<p>I will discharge 246 thee.</p>
<p>ARIEL That’s my noble master!</p>
<p>What shall I do? Say what? What shall I do?</p>
<p>PROSPERO Go make thyself like a nymph o’th’sea,</p>
<p>Be subject to no sight but thine and mine: invisible</p>
<p>To every eyeball else. Go take this shape</p>
<p>And hither come in’t: go! Hence with diligence!</p>
<p>Exit [Ariel ]</p>
<p>Awake, dear heart, awake. Thou hast slept well. Awake.</p>
<p>To Miranda</p>
<p>MIRANDA The strangeness of your story put</p>
<p>Heaviness 247 in me.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Shake it off. Come on:</p>
<p>We’ll visit Caliban, my slave, who never</p>
<p>Yields us kind answer.</p>
<p>MIRANDA ’Tis a villain 248 , sir, I do not love to look on.</p>
<p>PROSPERO But, as ’tis,</p>
<p>We cannot miss 249 him: he does make our fire,</p>
<p>Fetch in our wood and serves in offices 250</p>
<p>That profit us. What, ho! Slave! Caliban!</p>
<p>Thou earth 251 , thou! Speak!</p>
<p>CALIBAN There’s wood enough within.</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>PROSPERO Come forth, I say! There’s other business for thee:</p>
<p>Come, thou tortoise! When?</p>
<p>Enter Ariel like a water-nymph</p>
<p>Fine apparition: my quaint 252 Ariel,</p>
<p>Hark in thine ear.</p>
<p>ARIEL My lord, it shall be done.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>PROSPERO Thou poisonous slave, got 253 by the devil himself</p>
<p>Upon thy wicked dam 254 : come forth!</p>
<p>Enter Caliban</p>
<p>CALIBAN As wicked dew as e’er my mother brushed</p>
<p>With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen 255</p>
<p>Drop on you both! A southwest 256 blow on ye</p>
<p>And blister you all o’er!</p>
<p>PROSPERO For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps,</p>
<p>Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up: urchins 257</p>
<p>Shall, for that vast 258 of night that they may work,</p>
<p>All exercise 259 on thee: thou shalt be pinched</p>
<p>As thick as honeycomb 260 , each pinch more stinging</p>
<p>Than 261 bees that made ’em 262 .</p>
<p>CALIBAN I must eat my dinner.</p>
<p>This island’s mine by Sycorax my mother,</p>
<p>Which thou tak’st from me. When thou cam’st first,</p>
<p>Thou strok’st me and made much of me: wouldst give me</p>
<p>Water with berries 263 in’t, and teach me how</p>
<p>To name the bigger light, and how the less 264 ,</p>
<p>That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee</p>
<p>And showed thee all the qualities o’th’isle,</p>
<p>The fresh springs, brine-pits 265 , barren place and fertile.</p>
<p>Cursed be I that did so! All the charms 266</p>
<p>Of Sycorax — toads, beetles, bats — light 267 on you!</p>
<p>For I am all the subjects that you have,</p>
<p>Which first was mine own king: and here you sty 268 me</p>
<p>In this hard rock 269 , whiles you do keep from me</p>
<p>The rest o’th’island.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Thou most lying slave,</p>
<p>Whom stripes 270 may move, not kindness 271 ! I have used 272 thee
—</p>
<p>Filth as thou art — with humane 273 care, and lodged thee</p>
<p>In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate</p>
<p>The honour of my child 274 .</p>
<p>CALIBAN O ho, O ho! Would’t had been done!</p>
<p>Thou didst prevent me: I had peopled else 275</p>
<p>This isle with Calibans.</p>
<p>MIRANDA Abhorrèd slave,</p>
<p>Which any print 276 of goodness wilt not take,</p>
<p>Being capable of all ill 277 . I pitied thee,</p>
<p>Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour</p>
<p>One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,</p>
<p>Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like</p>
<p>A thing most brutish, I endowed thy purposes</p>
<p>With words that made them known. But thy vile race 278 —</p>
<p>Though thou didst learn — had that in’t which good natures</p>
<p>Could not abide to be with: therefore wast thou</p>
<p>Deservedly confined into this rock, who hadst</p>
<p>Deserved more 279 than a prison.</p>
<p>CALIBAN You taught me language, and my profit on’t</p>
<p>Is, I know how to curse. The red-plague 280 rid 281 you</p>
<p>For learning 282 me your language.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Hag-seed 283 , hence!</p>
<p>Fetch us in fuel, and be quick: thou’rt best 284</p>
<p>To answer other business. Shrug’st thou, malice?</p>
<p>If thou neglect’st or dost unwillingly</p>
<p>What I command, I’ll rack 285 thee with old cramps 286 ,</p>
<p>Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar,</p>
<p>That beasts shall tremble at thy din.</p>
<p>CALIBAN No, pray thee.—</p>
<p>I must obey: his art is of such power,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>It would control my dam’s god, Setebos 287 ,</p>
<p>And make a vassal 288 of him.</p>
<p>PROSPERO So, slave, hence!</p>
<p>Exit Caliban</p>
<p>Enter Ferdinand, and Ariel, invisible, playing and singing</p>
<p>ARIEL Come unto these yellow sands,</p>
<p>Song</p>
<p>And then take hands:</p>
<p>Curtsied when you have, and kissed</p>
<p>The wild waves whist 289 :</p>
<p>Foot it featly 290 here and there,</p>
<p>And, sweet sprites, bear</p>
<p>The burden 291 .</p>
<p>[SPIRITS Within, sing the ] (burden, dispersedly )</p>
<p>Hark, hark! Bow-wow!</p>
<p>The watch-dogs bark: bow-wow.</p>
<p>ARIEL Hark, hark! I hear</p>
<p>The strain 292 of strutting chanticleer 293</p>
<p>Cry, cock-a-diddle-dow.</p>
<p>FERDINAND Where should this music be? I’th’air or th’earth?</p>
<p>It sounds no more: and sure it waits upon 294</p>
<p>Some god o’th’island. Sitting on a bank,</p>
<p>Weeping again the 295 king my father’s wreck,</p>
<p>This music crept by me upon the waters,</p>
<p>Allaying both their fury and my passion 296</p>
<p>With its sweet air: thence I have followed it —</p>
<p>Or it hath drawn me rather — but ’tis gone.</p>
<p>No, it begins again.</p>
<p>ARIEL Full fathom five 297 thy father lies,</p>
<p>Song</p>
<p>Of his bones are coral made:</p>
<p>Those are pearls that were his eyes:</p>
<p>Nothing of him that doth fade 298 ,</p>
<p>But doth suffer 299 a sea-change</p>
<p>Into something rich and strange.</p>
<p>Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell 300 :</p>
<p>[SPIRITS Within, sing the ] (burden ) Ding-dong.</p>
<p>ARIEL Hark! Now I hear them: ding-dong, bell.</p>
<p>FERDINAND The ditty 301 does remember 302 my drowned father.</p>
<p>This is no mortal 303 business, nor no sound</p>
<p>That the earth owes 304 . I hear it now above me.</p>
<p>PROSPERO The fringèd curtains 305 of thine eye advance 306</p>
<p>And say what thou see’st yond 307 .</p>
<p>MIRANDA What is’t? A spirit?</p>
<p>Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,</p>
<p>It carries a brave 308 form. But ’tis a spirit.</p>
<p>PROSPERO No, wench: it eats, and sleeps, and hath such senses</p>
<p>As we have, such. This gallant 309 which thou see’st</p>
<p>Was in the wreck: and, but 310 he’s something 311 stained</p>
<p>With grief — that’s beauty’s canker 312 — thou mightst call him</p>
<p>A goodly 313 person: he hath lost his fellows</p>
<p>And strays about to find ’em.</p>
<p>MIRANDA I might call him</p>
<p>A thing divine, for nothing natural 314</p>
<p>I ever saw so noble.</p>
<p>PROSPERO It goes on, I see,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>As my soul prompts 315 it.— Spirit, fine spirit: I’ll free thee</p>
<p>To Ariel</p>
<p>Within two days for this.</p>
<p>FERDINAND Most sure, the goddess</p>
<p>On whom these airs 316 attend! Vouchsafe 317 my prayer</p>
<p>May know if you remain 318 upon this island,</p>
<p>And that you will some good instruction give</p>
<p>How I may bear me 319 here: my prime request,</p>
<p>Which I do last pronounce, is — O you wonder 320 ! —</p>
<p>If you be maid 321 or no?</p>
<p>MIRANDA No wonder, sir,</p>
<p>But certainly a maid.</p>
<p>FERDINAND My language? Heavens!</p>
<p>I am the best 322 of them that speak this speech,</p>
<p>Were I but where 323 ’tis spoken.</p>
<p>PROSPERO How? The best?</p>
<p>What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee?</p>
<p>FERDINAND A single thing 324 , as I am now, that wonders</p>
<p>To hear thee speak of Naples. He 325 does hear me:</p>
<p>And that he does, I weep. Myself am Naples,</p>
<p>Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb 326 , beheld</p>
<p>The king my father wrecked.</p>
<p>MIRANDA Alack, for mercy!</p>
<p>FERDINAND Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan</p>
<p>And his brave son 327 being twain 328 .</p>
<p>PROSPERO The Duke of Milan</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>And his more braver daughter could control 329 thee</p>
<p>If now ’twere fit to do’t. At the first sight</p>
<p>They have changed eyes 330 .— Delicate 331 Ariel,</p>
<p>To Ariel</p>
<p>I’ll set thee free for this.— A word, good sir,</p>
<p>To Ferdinand</p>
<p>I fear you have done yourself some wrong 332 : a word.</p>
<p>MIRANDA Why speaks my father so ungently 333 ? This</p>
<p>Is the third man that e’er I saw: the first</p>
<p>That e’er I sighed for. Pity move my father</p>
<p>To be inclined my way.</p>
<p>FERDINAND O, if a virgin,</p>
<p>And your affection not gone forth 334 , I’ll make you</p>
<p>The Queen of Naples.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Soft 335 , sir, one word more.—</p>
<p>They are both in either’s 336 powers: but this swift business</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>I must uneasy 337 make, lest too light 338 winning</p>
<p>Make the prize light.— One word more: I charge 339 thee</p>
<p>To Ferdinand</p>
<p>That thou attend 340 me: thou dost here usurp</p>
<p>The name thou ow’st not 341 , and hast put thyself</p>
<p>Upon this island as a spy, to win it</p>
<p>From me, the lord on’t 342 .</p>
<p>FERDINAND No, as I am a man.</p>
<p>MIRANDA There’s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple 343 :</p>
<p>If the ill-spirit have so fair a house,</p>
<p>Good things will strive to dwell with’t.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Follow me.—</p>
<p>To Ferdinand</p>
<p>Speak not you for him: he’s a traitor.— Come:</p>
<p>To Miranda/To Ferdinand</p>
<p>I’ll manacle thy neck and feet together:</p>
<p>Seawater shalt thou drink: thy food shall be</p>
<p>The fresh-brook mussels 344 , withered roots and husks</p>
<p>Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.</p>
<p>FERDINAND No!</p>
<p>I will resist such entertainment 345 till</p>
<p>Mine enemy has more power.</p>
<p>He draws, and is charmed from moving</p>
<p>MIRANDA O dear father,</p>
<p>Make not too rash a trial of him, for</p>
<p>He’s gentle 346 , and not fearful 347 .</p>
<p>PROSPERO What, I say,</p>
<p>My foot 348 my tutor?— Put thy sword up, traitor:</p>
<p>To Ferdinand</p>
<p>Who mak’st a show but dar’st not strike, thy conscience</p>
<p>Is so possessed with guilt. Come from thy ward 349 ,</p>
<p>For I can here disarm thee with this stick,</p>
<p>Brandishes his staff</p>
<p>And make thy weapon drop.</p>
<p>MIRANDA Beseech you, father.</p>
<p>Kneels or attempts to stop him</p>
<p>PROSPERO Hence! Hang not on my garments.</p>
<p>MIRANDA Sir, have pity:</p>
<p>I’ll be his surety 350 .</p>
<p>PROSPERO Silence! One word more</p>
<p>Shall make me chide 351 thee, if not hate thee. What,</p>
<p>An advocate for an impostor? Hush!</p>
<p>Thou think’st there is no more such shapes 352 as he,</p>
<p>Having seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench,</p>
<p>To 353 th’most of men this is a Caliban,</p>
<p>And they to him are angels.</p>
<p>MIRANDA My affections</p>
<p>Are then most humble: I have no ambition</p>
<p>To see a goodlier man.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Come on, obey:</p>
<p>To Ferdinand</p>
<p>Thy nerves 354 are in their infancy again</p>
<p>And have no vigour 355 in them.</p>
<p>FERDINAND So they are:</p>
<p>My spirits 356 , as in a dream, are all bound up.</p>
<p>My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel,</p>
<p>The wreck of all my friends, nor this man’s threats,</p>
<p>To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,</p>
<p>Might I but through 357 my prison once a day</p>
<p>Behold this maid: all corners else 358 o’th’earth</p>
<p>Let liberty make use of: space enough</p>
<p>Have I in such a prison.</p>
<p>PROSPERO It works.— Come on.—</p>
<p>Aside/To Ferdinand</p>
<p>Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!— Follow me.—</p>
<p>To Ariel/To Ferdinand</p>
<p>Hark what thou else shalt do me 359 .</p>
<p>To Ariel</p>
<p>MIRANDA Be of comfort:</p>
<p>My father’s of a better nature, sir,</p>
<p>Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted 360</p>
<p>Which now came from him.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Thou shalt be as free</p>
<p>To Ariel</p>
<p>As mountain winds; but then 361 exactly do</p>
<p>All points of my command.</p>
<p>ARIEL To th’syllable.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Come, follow.— Speak not for him.</p>
<p>To Ferdinand/To Miranda</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
