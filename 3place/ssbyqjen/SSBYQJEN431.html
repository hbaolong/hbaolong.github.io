continues</h4>
<p>Enter Poet and Painter</p>
<p>PAINTER As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where he
abides.</p>
<p>POET What’s to be thought of him? Does the rumour hold for true that
he’s so full of gold?</p>
<p>PAINTER Certain. Alcibiades reports it: Phrynia and Timandra had gold
of 1411 him. He likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great
quantity. ’Tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.</p>
<p>POET Then this breaking 1412 of his has been but a try 1413 for his
friends?</p>
<p>PAINTER Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens again, and
flourish with the highest 1414 . Therefore ’tis not amiss we tender 1415
our loves to him, in this supposed distress of his: it will show
honestly in us 1416 , and is very likely to load 1417 our purposes with
what they travail 1418 for, if it be a just and true report that goes of
his having 1419 .</p>
<p>POET What have you now to present unto him?</p>
<p>PAINTER Nothing at this time but my visitation 1420 : only I will
promise him an excellent piece.</p>
<p>POET I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent 1421 that’s
coming toward him.</p>
<p>PAINTER Good as the best 1422 . Promising is the very air 1423
o’th’time: it opens the eyes of expectation. Performance is ever the
duller for his act 1424 , and but 1425 in the plainer and simpler kind
of people the deed of saying 1426 is quite out of use 1427 . To promise
is most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind of will or
testament which argues a great sickness in his judgement that makes it
1428 .</p>
<p>Enter Timon from his cave</p>
<p>Unobserved by the others</p>
<p>TIMON Excellent workman, thou canst not paint a man so bad as is
thyself.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>POET I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him: it must
be a personating of himself 1429 , a satire against the softness of
prosperity, with a discovery 1430 of the infinite flatteries that follow
youth and opulency 1431 .</p>
<p>TIMON Must thou needs stand for 1432 a villain in thine own work?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Wilt thou whip 1433 thine own faults in other men? Do so, I have gold
for thee.</p>
<p>POET Nay, let’s seek him:</p>
<p>Then do we sin against our own estate,</p>
<p>When we may profit meet and come too late 1434 .</p>
<p>PAINTER True:</p>
<p>When the day serves 1435 , before black-cornered night,</p>
<p>Find what thou want’st by free and offered light. Come.</p>
<p>TIMON I’ll meet you at the turn 1436 . What a god’s gold,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>That he is worshipped in a baser temple</p>
<p>Than where swine feed!</p>
<p>’Tis thou 1437 that rigg’st the bark 1438 and plough’st the foam,</p>
<p>Settlest 1439 admirèd reverence in a slave:</p>
<p>To thee be worship, and thy saints 1440 for aye 1441</p>
<p>Be crowned with plagues that thee alone obey.</p>
<p>Fit 1442 I meet them.</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>POET Hail, worthy Timon!</p>
<p>PAINTER Our late 1443 noble master!</p>
<p>TIMON Have I once 1444 lived to see two honest men?</p>
<p>POET Sir,</p>
<p>Having often of your open 1445 bounty tasted,</p>
<p>Hearing you were retired 1446 , your friends fall’n off,</p>
<p>Whose thankless natures — O abhorrèd spirits! —</p>
<p>Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:</p>
<p>What, to you,</p>
<p>Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence 1447</p>
<p>To their whole being? I am rapt 1448 and cannot cover</p>
<p>The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude</p>
<p>With any size 1449 of words.</p>
<p>TIMON Let it go naked, men may see’t the better:</p>
<p>You that are honest, by being what you are,</p>
<p>Make them 1450 best seen and known.</p>
<p>PAINTER He and myself</p>
<p>Have travelled in the great shower 1451 of your gifts,</p>
<p>And sweetly felt it.</p>
<p>TIMON Ay, you are honest men.</p>
<p>PAINTER We are hither come to offer you our service.</p>
<p>TIMON Most honest men. Why, how shall I requite you?</p>
<p>Can you eat roots and drink cold water? No.</p>
<p>BOTH What we can do we’ll do to do you service.</p>
<p>TIMON You’re honest men. You’ve heard that I have gold,</p>
<p>I am sure you have. Speak truth: you’re honest men.</p>
<p>PAINTER So it is said, my noble lord, but therefore 1452</p>
<p>Came not my friend nor I.</p>
<p>TIMON Good honest men.— Thou draw’st a counterfeit 1453</p>
<p>To Painter</p>
<p>Best in all Athens. Thou’rt, indeed, the best:</p>
<p>Thou counterfeit’st most lively 1454 .</p>
<p>PAINTER So, so 1455 , my lord.</p>
<p>TIMON E’en so 1456 , sir, as I say.— And for thy fiction 1457 ,</p>
<p>To Poet</p>
<p>Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth 1458</p>
<p>That thou art even natural in thine art 1459 .</p>
<p>But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,</p>
<p>I must needs say you have a little fault:</p>
<p>Marry, ’tis not monstrous 1460 in you, neither wish I</p>
<p>You take much pains to mend.</p>
<p>BOTH Beseech your honour</p>
<p>To make it known to us.</p>
<p>TIMON You’ll take it ill 1461 .</p>
<p>BOTH Most thankfully, my lord.</p>
<p>TIMON Will you indeed?</p>
<p>BOTH Doubt it not, worthy lord.</p>
<p>TIMON There’s never a one of you but 1462 trusts a knave</p>
<p>That mightily deceives you.</p>
<p>BOTH Do we, my lord?</p>
<p>TIMON Ay, and you hear him cog 1463 , see him dissemble 1464 ,</p>
<p>Know his gross patchery 1465 , love him, feed him,</p>
<p>Keep 1466 in your bosom 1467 : yet remain assured</p>
<p>That he’s a made-up 1468 villain.</p>
<p>PAINTER I know none such, my lord.</p>
<p>POET Nor I.</p>
<p>TIMON Look you, I love you well. I’ll give you gold,</p>
<p>Rid me these villains from your companies:</p>
<p>Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught 1469 ,</p>
<p>Confound 1470 them by some course 1471 , and come to me,</p>
<p>I’ll give you gold enough.</p>
<p>BOTH Name them, my lord, let’s know them.</p>
<p>TIMON You that way— and you this— but two in company 1472 :</p>
<p>Each man apart, all single and alone,</p>
<p>Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.</p>
<p>If where thou art two villains shall not be,</p>
<p>Come not near him. If thou 1473 wouldst not reside</p>
<p>But where one villain is, then him 1474 abandon.</p>
<p>Throws stones at them</p>
<p>Hence, pack 1475 ! There’s gold: you came for gold, ye slaves.</p>
<p>You have work for me; there’s payment. Hence!</p>
<p>To Painter</p>
<p>You are an alchemist 1476 , make gold of that.</p>
<p>To Poet</p>
<p>Out, rascal dogs!</p>
<p>Exeunt [Poet and Painter ]</p>
<p>Timon retires to his cave</p>
<p>Enter Steward and two Senators</p>
<p>FLAVIUS It is in vain that you would speak with Timon,</p>
<p>For he is set so only to himself 1477</p>
<p>That nothing but himself which looks like man</p>
<p>Is friendly with him.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Bring us to his cave:</p>
<p>It is our part 1478 and promise to th’Athenians</p>
<p>To speak with Timon.</p>
<p>SECOND SENATOR At all times alike</p>
<p>Men are not still 1479 the same: ’twas time and griefs</p>
<p>That framed 1480 him thus: time with his fairer 1481 hand,</p>
<p>Offering the fortunes of his former days,</p>
<p>The former man may make him 1482 . Bring us to him,</p>
<p>And chance it as it may 1483 .</p>
<p>FLAVIUS Here is his cave.—</p>
<p>Peace and content be here! Lord Timon, Timon,</p>
<p>Look out and speak to friends: th’Athenians</p>
<p>By two of their most reverend senate greet thee.</p>
<p>Speak to them, noble Timon.</p>
<p>Enter Timon out of his cave</p>
<p>TIMON Thou sun that comforts burn! Speak and be hanged,</p>
<p>For each true word a blister, and each false</p>
<p>Be as a cantherizing 1484 to the root o’th’tongue,</p>
<p>Consuming it with speaking!</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Worthy Timon—</p>
<p>TIMON Of none but such as you, and you of Timon 1485 .</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.</p>
<p>TIMON I thank them, and would send them back the plague</p>
<p>Could I but catch it for them.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR O, forget</p>
<p>What we are sorry for ourselves in thee 1486 .</p>
<p>The senators with one consent 1487 of love</p>
<p>Entreat thee back to Athens, who have thought</p>
<p>On special dignities 1488 which vacant lie</p>
<p>For thy best use and wearing 1489 .</p>
<p>SECOND SENATOR They confess</p>
<p>Toward thee forgetfulness too general 1490 gross;</p>
<p>Which now the public body, which doth seldom</p>
<p>Play the recanter 1491 , feeling in itself</p>
<p>A lack of Timon’s aid, hath sense withal 1492</p>
<p>Of it own fall, restraining 1493 aid to Timon,</p>
<p>And send forth us to make their sorrowed 1494 render 1495 ,</p>
<p>Together with a recompense more fruitful</p>
<p>Than their offence can weigh down by the dram 1496 1497 :</p>
<p>Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth</p>
<p>As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs</p>
<p>And write in thee 1498 the figures of their love,</p>
<p>Ever to read them thine.</p>
<p>TIMON You witch 1499 me in it,</p>
<p>Surprise 1500 me to the very brink of tears;</p>
<p>Lend me a fool’s heart and a woman’s eyes,</p>
<p>And I’ll beweep 1501 these comforts, worthy senators.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Therefore so please thee to return with us</p>
<p>And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take</p>
<p>The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,</p>
<p>Allowed 1502 with absolute power and thy good name</p>
<p>Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back</p>
<p>Of Alcibiades th’approaches wild 1503 ,</p>
<p>Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up</p>
<p>His country’s peace.</p>
<p>SECOND SENATOR And shakes his threat’ning sword</p>
<p>Against the walls of Athens.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Therefore, Timon—</p>
<p>TIMON Well, sir, I will: therefore, I will, sir, thus.</p>
<p>If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,</p>
<p>Let Alcibiades know this of Timon:</p>
<p>That Timon cares not. But if he sack 1504 fair Athens,</p>
<p>And take our goodly agèd men by th’beards,</p>
<p>Giving our holy virgins to the stain 1505</p>
<p>Of contumelious 1506 , beastly, mad-brained war,</p>
<p>Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,</p>
<p>In pity of our agèd and our youth,</p>
<p>I cannot choose but tell him that I care not.</p>
<p>And let him take’t at worst 1507 , for their knives care not</p>
<p>While you have throats to answer 1508 . For myself,</p>
<p>There’s not a whittle 1509 in th’unruly camp</p>
<p>But I do prize it at my love before 1510</p>
<p>The reverend’st throat in Athens. So I leave you</p>
<p>To the protection of the prosperous gods,</p>
<p>As thieves to keepers 1511 .</p>
<p>FLAVIUS Stay not, all’s in vain.</p>
<p>TIMON Why, I was writing of my epitaph:</p>
<p>It will be seen tomorrow. My long sickness</p>
<p>Of health and living now begins to mend,</p>
<p>And nothing 1512 brings me all things. Go, live still,</p>
<p>Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,</p>
<p>And last so long enough 1513 .</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR We speak in vain.</p>
<p>TIMON But yet I love my country, and am not</p>
<p>One that rejoices in the common wreck</p>
<p>As common bruit 1514 doth put it.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR That’s well spoke.</p>
<p>TIMON Commend me to my loving countrymen—</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR These words become 1515 your lips as they pass through
them.</p>
<p>SECOND SENATOR And enter in our ears like great triumphers 1516</p>
<p>In their applauding gates.</p>
<p>TIMON Commend me to them,</p>
<p>And tell them that to ease them of their griefs,</p>
<p>Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,</p>
<p>Their pangs of love, with other incident throes 1517</p>
<p>That nature’s fragile vessel 1518 doth sustain</p>
<p>In life’s uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:</p>
<p>I’ll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades’ wrath.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR I like this well: he will return again.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>TIMON I have a tree, which grows here in my close 1519</p>
<p>That mine own use 1520 sequence of degree 1521 invites me to cut
down,</p>
<p>And shortly must I fell it. Tell my friends,</p>
<p>Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree</p>
<p>From high to low throughout, that whoso please 1522</p>
<p>To stop affliction, let him take his haste 1523 ,</p>
<p>Come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe,</p>
<p>And hang himself. I pray you do my greeting.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS Trouble him no further: thus you still 1524 shall find
him.</p>
<p>TIMON Come not to me again, but say to Athens,</p>
<p>Timon hath made his everlasting mansion 1525</p>
<p>Upon the beachèd verge 1526 of the salt flood 1527 ,</p>
<p>Who 1528 once a day with his embossèd 1529 froth</p>
<p>The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,</p>
<p>And let my gravestone be your oracle 1530 .</p>
<p>Lips, let four words go by and language end.</p>
<p>What is amiss, plague and infection mend.</p>
<p>Graves only be men’s works, and death their gain.</p>
<p>Sun, hide thy beams. Timon hath done his reign.</p>
<p>Exit Timon</p>
<p>Into his cave</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR His discontents are unremovably</p>
<p>Coupled to nature 1531 .</p>
<p>SECOND SENATOR Our hope in him is dead: let us return,</p>
<p>And strain 1532 what other means is left unto us</p>
<p>In our dear 1533 peril.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR It requires swift foot.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
