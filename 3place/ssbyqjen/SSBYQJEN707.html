scene 16 continues</h4>
<p>Alarum. Excursions 1821 . Enter the King, the Prince, Lord John of
Lancaster and Earl of Westmorland</p>
<p>The Prince has been wounded</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV I prithee,</p>
<p>Harry, withdraw thyself, thou bleed’st too much.</p>
<p>Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I beseech your majesty, make up 1822 ,</p>
<p>Lest your retirement 1823 do amaze 1824 your friends.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV I will do so.</p>
<p>My lord of Westmorland, lead him to his tent.</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Come, my lord, I’ll lead you to your tent.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help;</p>
<p>And heaven forbid a shallow scratch should drive</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,</p>
<p>Where stained 1825 nobility lies trodden on,</p>
<p>And rebels’ arms triumph in massacres!</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN We breathe 1826 too long: come, cousin Westmorland,</p>
<p>Our duty this way lies. For heaven’s sake, come.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Lancaster and Westmorland ]</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY By heaven, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster.</p>
<p>I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:</p>
<p>Before, I loved thee as a brother, John;</p>
<p>But now, I do respect thee as my soul.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point 1827</p>
<p>With lustier maintenance 1828 than I did look for</p>
<p>Of such an ungrown 1829 warrior.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY O, this boy lends mettle 1830 to us all!</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Douglas</p>
<p>DOUGLAS Another king? They grow like Hydra’s heads 1831 .</p>
<p>I am the Douglas, fatal to all those</p>
<p>That wear those colours 1832 on them. What art thou,</p>
<p>That counterfeit’st 1833 the person of a king?</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV The king himself, who, Douglas, grieves at heart</p>
<p>So many of his shadows 1834 thou hast met</p>
<p>And not the very 1835 king. I have two boys</p>
<p>Seek 1836 Percy and thyself about the field:</p>
<p>But, seeing thou fall’st on me so luckily,</p>
<p>I will assay 1837 thee, so defend thyself.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS I fear thou art another counterfeit,</p>
<p>And yet, in faith, thou bear’st thee like a king.</p>
<p>But mine 1838 I am sure thou art, whoe’er thou be,</p>
<p>And thus I win thee.</p>
<p>They fight, the King being in danger</p>
<p>Enter Prince</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like 1839</p>
<p>Never to hold it up again! The spirits</p>
<p>Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms 1840 ;</p>
<p>It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee,</p>
<p>Who never promiseth but he means to pay 1841 .</p>
<p>They fight. Douglas flieth 1842</p>
<p>Cheerly 1843 , my lord. How fares your grace?</p>
<p>Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succour sent,</p>
<p>And so hath Clifton: I’ll to Clifton straight.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Stay, and breathe awhile.</p>
<p>Thou hast redeemed thy lost opinion 1844 ,</p>
<p>And showed thou mak’st some tender of my life 1845 ,</p>
<p>In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY O heaven! They did me too much injury</p>
<p>That ever said I hearkened 1846 to your death.</p>
<p>If it were so, I might have let alone</p>
<p>The insulting 1847 hand of Douglas over you,</p>
<p>Which would have been as speedy in your end</p>
<p>As all the poisonous potions in the world</p>
<p>And saved the treacherous labour of your son.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Make up to 1848 Clifton, I’ll to Sir Nicholas
Gawsey.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Hotspur</p>
<p>HOTSPUR If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Thou speak’st as if I would deny my name.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR My name is Harry Percy.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Why, then I see</p>
<p>A very valiant rebel of that name.</p>
<p>I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,</p>
<p>To share with me in glory any more:</p>
<p>Two stars keep not their motion 1849 in one sphere 1850 ,</p>
<p>Nor can one England brook 1851 a double reign,</p>
<p>Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Nor shall it, Harry, for the hour is come</p>
<p>To end the one of us; and would to heaven</p>
<p>Thy name in arms 1852 were now as great as mine!</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I’ll make it greater ere I part from thee,</p>
<p>And all the budding honours on thy crest 1853</p>
<p>I’ll crop, to make a garland for my head.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR I can no longer brook thy vanities 1854 .</p>
<p>Fight</p>
<p>Enter Falstaff</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well said 1855 , Hal! To it Hal! Nay, you shall find no
boy’s play here, I can tell you.</p>
<p>Enter Douglas, he fights with Falstaff, who falls down as if he were
dead</p>
<p>[Exit Douglas ]</p>
<p>The Prince killeth Percy 1856 [Hotspur ]</p>
<p>HOTSPUR O, Harry, thou hast robbed me of my youth!</p>
<p>I better brook the loss of brittle 1857 life</p>
<p>Than those proud titles 1858 thou hast won of me.</p>
<p>They wound my thoughts worse than the sword my flesh:</p>
<p>But thought’s the slave of life, and life, time’s fool;</p>
<p>And time that takes survey of all the world</p>
<p>Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy 1859 ,</p>
<p>But that the earth and the cold hand of death</p>
<p>Lies on my tongue. No, Percy, thou art dust</p>
<p>And food for—</p>
<p>Dies</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY For worms, brave Percy. Farewell, great heart!</p>
<p>Ill-weaved 1860 ambition, how much art thou shrunk?</p>
<p>When that this body did contain a spirit,</p>
<p>A kingdom for it was too small a bound 1861 ,</p>
<p>But now two paces of the vilest earth</p>
<p>Is room enough. This earth that bears thee dead</p>
<p>Bears not alive so stout 1862 a gentleman.</p>
<p>If thou wert sensible 1863 of courtesy,</p>
<p>I should not make so great a show of zeal 1864 ,</p>
<p>But let my favours 1865 hide thy mangled face,</p>
<p>Covers Hotspur’s face</p>
<p>And, even in thy behalf, I’ll thank myself</p>
<p>For doing these fair rites of tenderness.</p>
<p>Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!</p>
<p>Thy ignominy 1866 sleep with thee 1867 in the grave,</p>
<p>But not remembered in thy epitaph!—</p>
<p>What? Old acquaintance? Could not all this flesh</p>
<p>He sees Falstaff on the ground</p>
<p>Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!</p>
<p>I could have better spared a better man.</p>
<p>O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,</p>
<p>If I were much in love with vanity!</p>
<p>Death hath not struck so fat a deer today,</p>
<p>Though many dearer 1868 , in this bloody fray.</p>
<p>Embowelled 1869 will I see thee by and by:</p>
<p>Till then in blood 1870 by noble Percy lie.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Falstaff riseth up</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Embowelled! If thou embowel me today, I’ll give you leave to
powder 1871 me and eat me too tomorrow. ’Twas time to counterfeit, or
that hot termagant 1872 Scot had paid me scot and lot 1873 too.
Counterfeit? I am no counterfeit; to die, is to be a counterfeit, for he
is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man. But to
counterfeit dying, when a man thereby liveth, is to be no counterfeit,
but the true and perfect image of life indeed. The better part of valour
is discretion 1874 , in the which better part I have saved my life. I am
afraid of this gunpowder 1875 Percy, though he be dead. How, if he
should counterfeit too and rise? I am afraid he would prove the better
counterfeit: therefore I’ll make him sure, yea, and I’ll swear I killed
him. Why may not he rise as well as I? Nothing confutes 1876 me but
eyes, and nobody sees me. Therefore, sirrah, with a new wound in your
thigh, come you along with me.</p>
<p>Stabs him</p>
<p>Takes Hotspur on his back</p>
<p>Enter Prince and John of Lancaster</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Come, brother John, full bravely hast thou fleshed
1877</p>
<p>Thy maiden 1878 sword 1879 .</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN But, soft! Who have we here?</p>
<p>Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I did. I saw him dead,</p>
<p>Breathless and bleeding on the ground.—</p>
<p>Art thou alive? Or is it fantasy 1880</p>
<p>To Falstaff</p>
<p>That plays upon our eyesight? I prithee speak.</p>
<p>We will not trust our eyes without our ears.</p>
<p>Thou art not what thou seem’st.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF No, that’s certain: I am not a double man 1881 . But if I be
not Jack Falstaff, then am I a jack 1882 . There is Percy. If your
father will do me any honour, so: if not, let him kill the next Percy
himself. I look to be either earl or duke, I can assure you.</p>
<p>Throws the body down</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how the world is given to lying! I
grant you I was down and out of breath, and so was he. But we rose both
at an instant 1883 and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock 1884 . If
I may be believed, so: if not, let them that should reward valour bear
the sin upon their own heads. I’ll take’t on my death 1885 , I gave him
this wound in the thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it, I
would make him eat a piece of my sword.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN This is the strangest tale that e’er I heard.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY This is the strangest fellow, brother John.—</p>
<p>Come, bring your luggage 1886 nobly on your back.</p>
<p>To Falstaff</p>
<p>For my part, if a lie may do thee grace 1887 ,</p>
<p>I’ll gild 1888 it with the happiest 1889 terms I have.—</p>
<p>A retreat 1890 is sounded</p>
<p>The trumpets sound retreat, the day is ours 1891 .—</p>
<p>Come, brother, let’s to the highest 1892 of the field,</p>
<p>To see what friends are living, who are dead.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Prince Henry and Lancaster ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I’ll follow, as they say, for reward. He that rewards me,
heaven reward him! If I do grow great again, I’ll grow less 1893 , for
I’ll purge 1894 , and leave 1895 sack, and live cleanly as a nobleman
should do.</p>
