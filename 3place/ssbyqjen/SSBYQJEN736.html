<h4 id="scene-1-35-running-scene-1">Scene 1 35 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter the two Bishops of Canterbury and Ely</p>
<p>CANTERBURY My lord, I’ll tell you: that self 36 bill is urged 37
,</p>
<p>Which in th’eleventh year of the last king’s 38 reign</p>
<p>Was like 39 , and had indeed against us passed,</p>
<p>But that the scambling 40 and unquiet time</p>
<p>Did push it out of further question 41 .</p>
<p>ELY But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?</p>
<p>CANTERBURY It must be thought on: if it pass against us,</p>
<p>We lose the better half of our possession.</p>
<p>For all the temporal 42 lands which men devout</p>
<p>By testament 43 have given to the Church</p>
<p>Would they strip from us; being valued thus:</p>
<p>As much as would maintain 44 , to the king’s honour,</p>
<p>Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,</p>
<p>Six thousand and two hundred good esquires 45 ,</p>
<p>And, to relief of lazars 46 and weak age</p>
<p>Of indigent 47 faint souls past corporal toil 48 ,</p>
<p>A hundred almshouses right well supplied,</p>
<p>And to the coffers 49 of the king beside 50 ,</p>
<p>A thousand pounds by th’year. Thus runs the bill 51 .</p>
<p>ELY This would drink deep 52 .</p>
<p>CANTERBURY ’Twould drink the cup and all.</p>
<p>ELY But what prevention?</p>
<p>CANTERBURY The king is full of grace 53 and fair regard 54 .</p>
<p>ELY And a true lover of the holy church.</p>
<p>CANTERBURY The courses 55 of his youth promised it not.</p>
<p>The breath no sooner left his father’s body,</p>
<p>But that his wildness, mortified 56 in him,</p>
<p>Seemed to die too. Yea, at that very moment</p>
<p>Consideration 57 like an angel came</p>
<p>And whipped th’offending Adam 58 out of him,</p>
<p>Leaving his body as a paradise 59 ,</p>
<p>T’envelop and contain celestial spirits 60 .</p>
<p>Never was such a sudden scholar made,</p>
<p>Never came reformation in a flood,</p>
<p>With such a heady currance 61 , scouring 62 faults,</p>
<p>Nor never Hydra-headed 63 wilfulness</p>
<p>So soon did lose his seat 64 , and all at once,</p>
<p>As in this king.</p>
<p>ELY We are blessèd in the change.</p>
<p>CANTERBURY Hear him but reason in divinity,</p>
<p>And, all-admiring, with an inward wish</p>
<p>You would desire the king were made a prelate.</p>
<p>Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,</p>
<p>You would say it hath been all in all 65 his study.</p>
<p>List 66 his discourse of war, and you shall hear</p>
<p>A fearful battle rendered you in music 67 .</p>
<p>Turn him to any cause of policy 68 ,</p>
<p>The Gordian knot 69 of it he will unloose,</p>
<p>Familiar as his garter 70 , that, when he speaks,</p>
<p>The air, a chartered 71 libertine 72 , is still,</p>
<p>And the mute wonder lurketh in men’s ears</p>
<p>To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences,</p>
<p>So that the art and practic 73 part of life</p>
<p>Must be the mistress to this theoric 74 :</p>
<p>Which is a wonder how his grace should glean 75 it,</p>
<p>Since his addiction was to courses vain 76 ,</p>
<p>His companies 77 unlettered 78 , rude 79 and shallow,</p>
<p>His hours filled up with riots 80 , banquets, sports,</p>
<p>And never noted 81 in him any study,</p>
<p>Any retirement, any sequestration 82</p>
<p>From open 83 haunts and popularity 84 .</p>
<p>ELY The strawberry grows underneath the nettle</p>
<p>And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best</p>
<p>Neighboured by fruit of baser quality.</p>
<p>And so the prince obscured 85 his contemplation 86</p>
<p>Under the veil of wildness, which, no doubt,</p>
<p>Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</p>
<p>Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty 87 .</p>
<p>CANTERBURY It must be so, for miracles are ceased.</p>
<p>And therefore we must needs 88 admit the means 89</p>
<p>How things are perfected.</p>
<p>ELY But, my good lord,</p>
<p>How now for mitigation 90 of this bill</p>
<p>Urged by the commons 91 ? Doth his majesty</p>
<p>Incline to 92 it, or no?</p>
<p>CANTERBURY He seems indifferent,</p>
<p>Or rather swaying more upon 93 our part</p>
<p>Than cherishing th’exhibitors against us 94 ,</p>
<p>For I have made an offer to his majesty,</p>
<p>Upon 95 our spiritual convocation 96</p>
<p>And in regard of causes 97 now in hand,</p>
<p>Which I have opened 98 to his grace at large 99 ,</p>
<p>As touching 100 France, to give a greater sum</p>
<p>Than ever at one time the clergy yet</p>
<p>Did to his predecessors part withal 101 102 .</p>
<p>ELY How did this offer seem received, my lord?</p>
<p>CANTERBURY With good acceptance of his majesty,</p>
<p>Save that there was not time enough to hear,</p>
<p>As I perceived his grace would fain 103 have done,</p>
<p>The severals 104 and unhidden passages 105</p>
<p>Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms</p>
<p>And generally to the crown and seat of France,</p>
<p>Derived from Edward 106 , his great-grandfather.</p>
<p>ELY What was th’impediment that broke this off?</p>
<p>CANTERBURY The French ambassador upon that instant</p>
<p>Craved audience; and the hour I think is come</p>
<p>To give him hearing. Is it four o’clock?</p>
<p>ELY It is.</p>
<p>CANTERBURY Then go we in to know his embassy 107 ,</p>
<p>Which I could with a ready guess declare,</p>
<p>Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.</p>
<p>ELY I’ll wait upon you and I long to hear it.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
