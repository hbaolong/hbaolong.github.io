<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-9">Scene 2 ／ running scene 9</h4>
<p>Enter the Duke of Norfolk, Duke of Suffolk, Lord Surrey and Lord
Chamberlain</p>
<p>NORFOLK If you will now unite in your complaints,</p>
<p>And force 956 them with a constancy 957 , the cardinal</p>
<p>Cannot stand under them. If you omit</p>
<p>The offer of this time 958 , I cannot promise</p>
<p>But that you shall sustain more new disgraces,</p>
<p>With these you bear already.</p>
<p>SURREY I am joyful</p>
<p>To meet the least occasion that may give me</p>
<p>Remembrance of my father-in-law the duke 959 ,</p>
<p>To be revenged on him 960 .</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Which of the peers</p>
<p>Have uncontemned 961 gone by him, or at least</p>
<p>Strangely neglected 962 ? When did he regard</p>
<p>The stamp of nobleness in any person</p>
<p>Out of 963 himself?</p>
<p>CHAMBERLAIN My lords, you speak your pleasures:</p>
<p>What he deserves of you and me I know:</p>
<p>What we can do to him, though now the time</p>
<p>Gives way 964 to us, I much fear 965 . If you cannot</p>
<p>Bar his access to th’king, never attempt</p>
<p>Anything on him: for he hath a witchcraft</p>
<p>Over the king in’s 966 tongue.</p>
<p>NORFOLK O, fear him not:</p>
<p>His spell in that is out 967 : the king hath found</p>
<p>Matter against him that forever mars</p>
<p>The honey of his language. No, he’s 968 settled,</p>
<p>Not to come off 969 , in his 970 displeasure.</p>
<p>SURREY Sir,</p>
<p>I should be glad to hear such news as this</p>
<p>Once every hour.</p>
<p>NORFOLK Believe it, this is true.</p>
<p>In the divorce his contrary 971 proceedings</p>
<p>Are all unfolded 972 , wherein he appears</p>
<p>As I would wish mine enemy.</p>
<p>SURREY How came</p>
<p>His practices 973 to light?</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Most strangely.</p>
<p>SURREY O, how, how?</p>
<p>SUFFOLK The cardinal’s letters to the Pope miscarried 974 ,</p>
<p>And came to th’eye o’th’king, wherein was read</p>
<p>How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness</p>
<p>To stay 975 the judgment o’th’divorce, for if</p>
<p>It did take place, ‘I do’, quoth he, ’perceive</p>
<p>My king is tangled in affection to</p>
<p>A creature 976 of the queen’s, Lady Anne Bullen.’</p>
<p>SURREY Has the king this?</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Believe it.</p>
<p>SURREY Will this work?</p>
<p>CHAMBERLAIN The king in this perceives him 977 how he coasts</p>
<p>And hedges 978 his own way. But in this point</p>
<p>All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic 979</p>
<p>After his patient’s death: the king already</p>
<p>Hath married the fair lady.</p>
<p>SURREY Would he had.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK May you be happy in your wish, my lord,</p>
<p>For I profess you have it.</p>
<p>SURREY Now, all my joy</p>
<p>Trace the conjunction 980 .</p>
<p>SUFFOLK My amen to’t.</p>
<p>NORFOLK All men’s 981 .</p>
<p>SUFFOLK There’s order given for her coronation:</p>
<p>Marry 982 , this is yet but young 983 , and may be left</p>
<p>To some ears unrecounted 984 . But, my lords,</p>
<p>She is a gallant 985 creature, and complete 986</p>
<p>In mind and feature. I persuade me 987 , from her</p>
<p>Will fall 988 some blessing to this land, which shall</p>
<p>In it be memorized 989 .</p>
<p>SURREY But will the king</p>
<p>Digest 990 this letter of the cardinal’s?</p>
<p>The Lord forbid!</p>
<p>NORFOLK Marry, amen.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK No, no:</p>
<p>There be more wasps that buzz about his nose</p>
<p>Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius</p>
<p>Is stol’n away to Rome: hath ta’en no leave:</p>
<p>Has left the cause 991 o’th’king unhandled 992 , and</p>
<p>Is posted 993 as the agent of our cardinal</p>
<p>To second all his plot. I do assure you</p>
<p>The king cried ‘Ha!’ at this.</p>
<p>CHAMBERLAIN Now, God incense him,</p>
<p>And let him cry ‘Ha!’ louder.</p>
<p>NORFOLK But, my lord,</p>
<p>When returns Cranmer?</p>
<p>SUFFOLK He is returned in his opinions 994 , which</p>
<p>Have satisfied the king for his divorce,</p>
<p>Together with all famous colleges</p>
<p>Almost in Christendom: shortly, I believe,</p>
<p>His second marriage shall be published 995 , and</p>
<p>Her coronation. Katherine no more</p>
<p>Shall be called ‘Queen’, but ‘Princess Dowager’</p>
<p>And ‘widow to Prince Arthur’.</p>
<p>NORFOLK This same Cranmer’s</p>
<p>A worthy fellow, and hath ta’en much pain</p>
<p>In the king’s business.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK He has, and we shall see him</p>
<p>For it an archbishop.</p>
<p>NORFOLK So I hear.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK ’Tis so.</p>
<p>Enter [Cardinal ] Wolsey and Cromwell</p>
<p>The cardinal.</p>
<p>NORFOLK Observe, observe, he’s moody 996 .</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY The packet 997 , Cromwell: gave’t you the king?</p>
<p>CROMWELL To his own hand, in’s bedchamber.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Looked he</p>
<p>O’th’inside of the paper? 998</p>
<p>CROMWELL Presently 999</p>
<p>He did unseal them, and the first he viewed,</p>
<p>He did it with a serious mind: a heed 1000</p>
<p>Was in his countenance. You he bade</p>
<p>Attend him here this morning.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Is he ready</p>
<p>To come abroad 1001 ?</p>
<p>CROMWELL I think by this 1002 he is.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Leave me awhile.—</p>
<p>Exit Cromwell</p>
<p>It shall be to the Duchess of Alençon,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>The French king’s sister: he shall marry her.</p>
<p>Anne Bullen? No, I’ll no Anne Bullens for him:</p>
<p>There’s more in’t than fair visage 1003 . Bullen?</p>
<p>No, we’ll no Bullens. Speedily I wish</p>
<p>To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke?</p>
<p>NORFOLK He’s discontented.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Maybe he hears the king</p>
<p>Does whet his anger to him.</p>
<p>SURREY Sharp enough,</p>
<p>Lord, for thy justice.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY The late 1004 queen’s gentlewoman? A knight’s
daughter,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>To be her mistress’ mistress? The queen’s queen?</p>
<p>This candle burns not clear 1005 : ’tis I must snuff it 1006 ,</p>
<p>Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous</p>
<p>And well deserving? Yet I know her for</p>
<p>A spleeny Lutheran 1007 , and not wholesome 1008 to</p>
<p>Our cause, that she should lie i’th’bosom of 1009</p>
<p>Our hard-ruled 1010 king. Again, there is sprung up</p>
<p>An heretic, an arch-one 1011 : Cranmer, one</p>
<p>Hath 1012 crawled into the favour of the king,</p>
<p>And is his oracle.</p>
<p>NORFOLK He is vexed at something.</p>
<p>Enter King [Henry ], reading of a schedule 1013 [and Lovell ]</p>
<p>SURREY I would ’twere something that would fret 1014 the string,</p>
<p>The master-cord 1015 on’s 1016 heart!</p>
<p>SUFFOLK The king, the king!</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII What piles of wealth hath he accumulated</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>To his own portion 1017 ? And what expense by th’hour</p>
<p>Seems to flow from him? How i’th’name of thrift</p>
<p>Does he rake this together?— Now, my lords,</p>
<p>Aloud</p>
<p>Saw you the cardinal?</p>
<p>NORFOLK My lord, we have</p>
<p>Stood here observing him. Some strange commotion 1018</p>
<p>Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts,</p>
<p>Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,</p>
<p>Then lays his finger on his temple, straight 1019</p>
<p>Springs out into fast gait, then stops again,</p>
<p>Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts</p>
<p>His eye against 1020 the moon: in most strange postures</p>
<p>We have seen him set himself.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII It may well be,</p>
<p>There is a mutiny in’s mind. This morning</p>
<p>Papers of state he sent me to peruse,</p>
<p>As I required: and wot 1021 you what I found</p>
<p>There, on my conscience put unwittingly?</p>
<p>Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing 1022</p>
<p>The several parcels 1023 of his plate 1024 , his treasure,</p>
<p>Rich stuffs 1025 and ornaments of household 1026 , which</p>
<p>I find at such proud rate 1027 , that it outspeaks</p>
<p>Possession of a subject 1028 .</p>
<p>NORFOLK It’s heaven’s will:</p>
<p>Some spirit put this paper in the packet,</p>
<p>To bless your eye withal 1029 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII If we did think</p>
<p>His contemplation 1030 were above the earth,</p>
<p>And fixed on spiritual object, he should 1031 still</p>
<p>Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid</p>
<p>His thinkings are below the moon 1032 , not worth</p>
<p>His serious considering.</p>
<p>King takes his seat; [and ] whispers [with ] Lovell, who goes to the
Cardinal</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Heaven forgive me!—</p>
<p>Ever God bless your highness.</p>
<p>To the king</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Good, my lord,</p>
<p>You are full of heavenly stuff 1033 , and bear the inventory</p>
<p>Of your best graces 1034 in your mind, the which</p>
<p>You were now running o’er: you have scarce time</p>
<p>To steal from spiritual leisure 1035 a brief span</p>
<p>To keep your earthly audit 1036 : sure, in that</p>
<p>I deem you an ill husband 1037 , and am glad 1038</p>
<p>To have you therein my companion.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Sir,</p>
<p>For holy offices I have a time: a time</p>
<p>To think upon the part of business which</p>
<p>I bear i’th’state: and nature does require</p>
<p>Her times of preservation 1039 , which perforce 1040</p>
<p>I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,</p>
<p>Must give my tendance 1041 to.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII You have said well.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY And ever may your highness yoke together,</p>
<p>As I will lend you cause, my doing well</p>
<p>With my well saying.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII ’Tis well said again,</p>
<p>And ’tis a kind of good deed to say well:</p>
<p>And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:</p>
<p>He said he did, and with his deed did crown</p>
<p>His word upon you 1042 . Since I had my office,</p>
<p>I have kept you next my heart, have not alone 1043</p>
<p>Employed you where high profits might come home,</p>
<p>But pared 1044 my present havings 1045 , to bestow</p>
<p>My bounties upon you.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY What should this mean?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>SURREY The Lord increase this business!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Have I not made you,</p>
<p>The prime 1046 man of the state? I pray you tell me</p>
<p>If what I now pronounce 1047 you have found true:</p>
<p>And if you may confess it, say withal 1048</p>
<p>If you are bound to us or no. What say you?</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY My sovereign, I confess your royal graces 1049 ,</p>
<p>Showered on me daily, have been more than could</p>
<p>My studied purposes requite 1050 , which went</p>
<p>Beyond all man’s endeavours. My endeavours</p>
<p>Have ever come too short of my desires,</p>
<p>Yet filed 1051 with my abilities: mine own ends</p>
<p>Have been mine so 1052 that evermore they pointed</p>
<p>To th’good of your most sacred person and</p>
<p>The profit of the state. For your great graces</p>
<p>Heaped upon me, poor undeserver, I</p>
<p>Can nothing render but allegiant 1053 thanks,</p>
<p>My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,</p>
<p>Which ever has and ever shall be growing,</p>
<p>Till death, that winter, kill it.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Fairly answered:</p>
<p>A loyal and obedient subject is</p>
<p>Therein illustrated: the honour of it</p>
<p>Does pay the act of it 1054 , as i’th’contrary</p>
<p>The foulness 1055 is the punishment. I presume</p>
<p>That as my hand has opened bounty to you,</p>
<p>My heart dropped love, my power 1056 rained honour, more</p>
<p>On you than any: so your hand and heart,</p>
<p>Your brain, and every function of your power,</p>
<p>Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty 1057 ,</p>
<p>As ’twere in love’s particular 1058 , be more</p>
<p>To me, your friend, than any.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY I do profess</p>
<p>That for your highness’ good I ever laboured</p>
<p>More than mine own: that am, have and will be 1059 —</p>
<p>Though all the world should crack 1060 their duty to you,</p>
<p>And throw it from their soul: though perils did</p>
<p>Abound, as thick as thought could make ’em, and</p>
<p>Appear in forms more horrid 1061 — yet my duty,</p>
<p>As doth a rock against the chiding 1062 flood,</p>
<p>Should the approach of this wild river break 1063 ,</p>
<p>And stand unshaken yours.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII ’Tis nobly spoken:</p>
<p>Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,</p>
<p>For you have seen him open’t. Read o’er this,</p>
<p>Gives Wolsey a paper</p>
<p>And after, this, and then to breakfast with</p>
<p>Gives him another paper</p>
<p>What appetite you have.</p>
<p>Exit King, frowning upon the Cardinal, the Nobles throng after him,
smiling and whispering</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY What should this mean?</p>
<p>What sudden anger’s this? How have I reaped it?</p>
<p>He parted frowning from me, as if ruin</p>
<p>Leaped from his eyes. So looks the chafèd 1064 lion</p>
<p>Upon the daring huntsman that has galled 1065 him:</p>
<p>Then makes him nothing 1066 . I must read this paper:</p>
<p>I fear the story 1067 of his anger.— ’Tis so:</p>
<p>He reads one of the papers</p>
<p>This paper has undone 1068 me: ’tis the account 1069</p>
<p>Of all that world 1070 of wealth I have drawn together</p>
<p>For mine own ends — indeed, to gain the popedom,</p>
<p>And fee 1071 my friends in Rome. O negligence,</p>
<p>Fit for a fool to fall by! What cross 1072 devil</p>
<p>Made me put this main 1073 secret in the packet</p>
<p>I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?</p>
<p>No new device 1074 to beat this from his brains?</p>
<p>I know ’twill stir 1075 him strongly. Yet I know</p>
<p>A way, if it take right 1076 , in spite of fortune</p>
<p>Will bring me off 1077 again. What’s this? ‘To th’Pope’?</p>
<p>The letter, as I live, with all the business</p>
<p>I writ to’s holiness. Nay then, farewell:</p>
<p>I have touched the highest point of all my greatness,</p>
<p>And from that full meridian 1078 of my glory,</p>
<p>I haste now to my setting 1079 . I shall fall</p>
<p>Like a bright exhalation 1080 in the evening,</p>
<p>And no man see me more.</p>
<p>Enter to Wolsey, the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the Earl of Surrey
and the Lord Chamberlain</p>
<p>NORFOLK Hear the king’s pleasure, cardinal, who commands you</p>
<p>To render up the great seal presently 1081</p>
<p>Into our hands, and to confine yourself</p>
<p>To Asher House 1082 , my lord of Winchester’s,</p>
<p>Till you hear further from his highness.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Stay:</p>
<p>Where’s your commission 1083 , lords? Words cannot carry</p>
<p>Authority so weighty.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Who dare cross 1084 ’em,</p>
<p>Bearing the king’s will from his mouth expressly?</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Till I find more than will or words to do it 1085
—</p>
<p>I mean your malice — know, officious lords,</p>
<p>I dare and must deny it. Now I feel</p>
<p>Of what coarse metal 1086 ye are moulded: envy 1087 .</p>
<p>How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,</p>
<p>As if it fed ye, and how sleek 1088 and wanton 1089</p>
<p>Ye appear in everything may bring my ruin!</p>
<p>Follow your envious courses, men of malice:</p>
<p>You have Christian warrant for ’em, and no doubt</p>
<p>In time will find their fit rewards 1090 . That seal</p>
<p>You ask with such a violence, the king,</p>
<p>Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me:</p>
<p>Bade me enjoy 1091 it, with the place and honours,</p>
<p>During my life: and to confirm his goodness,</p>
<p>Tied 1092 it by letters patents 1093 . Now, who’ll take it?</p>
<p>SURREY The king, that gave it.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY It must be himself, then.</p>
<p>SURREY Thou art a proud traitor, priest.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Proud lord, thou liest:</p>
<p>Within these forty hours 1094 Surrey durst better</p>
<p>Have burnt that tongue than said so.</p>
<p>SURREY Thy ambition,</p>
<p>Thou scarlet sin 1095 , robbed this bewailing land</p>
<p>Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law:</p>
<p>The heads of all thy brother cardinals,</p>
<p>With thee, and all thy best parts 1096 bound together,</p>
<p>Weighed 1097 not a hair of 1098 his. Plague of your policy 1099 ,</p>
<p>You sent me deputy for Ireland,</p>
<p>Far from his succour 1100 , from the king, from all</p>
<p>That might have mercy on the fault 1101 thou gav’st 1102 him:</p>
<p>Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,</p>
<p>Absolved him with an axe.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY This, and all else</p>
<p>This talking lord can lay upon my credit 1103 ,</p>
<p>I answer is most false. The duke by law</p>
<p>Found his deserts. How innocent I was</p>
<p>From 1104 any private malice in his end,</p>
<p>His noble jury and foul cause 1105 can witness.</p>
<p>If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you</p>
<p>You have as little honesty as honour,</p>
<p>That 1106 in the way of loyalty and truth</p>
<p>Toward the king, my ever royal master,</p>
<p>Dare mate 1107 a sounder man than Surrey can be,</p>
<p>And all that love his follies.</p>
<p>SURREY By my soul,</p>
<p>Your long coat, priest, protects you: thou shouldst feel</p>
<p>My sword i’th’life-blood of thee else. My lords,</p>
<p>Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?</p>
<p>And from this fellow 1108 ? If we live thus tamely,</p>
<p>To be thus jaded 1109 by a piece of scarlet,</p>
<p>Farewell nobility: let his grace go forward,</p>
<p>And dare us with his cap, like larks 1110 .</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY All goodness</p>
<p>Is poison to thy stomach.</p>
<p>SURREY Yes, that goodness</p>
<p>Of gleaning all the land’s wealth into one,</p>
<p>Into your own hands, Card’nal, by extortion:</p>
<p>The goodness of your intercepted packets</p>
<p>You writ to th’Pope against the king: your goodness,</p>
<p>Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.</p>
<p>My lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,</p>
<p>As you respect the common good, the state</p>
<p>Of our despised nobility, our issues 1111 ,</p>
<p>Whom if he 1112 live will scarce be gentlemen,</p>
<p>Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles 1113</p>
<p>Collected from his life. I’ll startle you</p>
<p>Worse than the sacring bell 1114 , when the brown 1115 wench 1116</p>
<p>Lay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY How much, methinks, I could despise this man,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>But that I am bound in charity against it.</p>
<p>NORFOLK Those articles, my lord, are in the king’s hand 1117 :</p>
<p>But thus much 1118 : they are foul 1119 ones.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY So much fairer</p>
<p>And spotless shall mine innocence arise,</p>
<p>When the king knows my truth.</p>
<p>SURREY This cannot save you:</p>
<p>I thank my memory, I yet remember</p>
<p>Some of these articles, and out 1120 they shall.</p>
<p>Now, if you can blush and cry ‘Guilty’, cardinal,</p>
<p>You’ll show a little honesty.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Speak on, sir:</p>
<p>I dare 1121 your worst objections 1122 : if I blush,</p>
<p>It is to see a nobleman want 1123 manners.</p>
<p>SURREY I had rather want those than my head. Have at you! 1124</p>
<p>First, that without the king’s assent or knowledge,</p>
<p>You wrought 1125 to be a legate 1126 , by which power</p>
<p>You maimed the jurisdiction of all bishops.</p>
<p>NORFOLK Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else</p>
<p>To foreign princes, ‘Ego et Rex meus 1127’</p>
<p>Was still 1128 inscribed, in which you brought the king</p>
<p>To be your servant.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Then, that without the knowledge</p>
<p>Either of king or council, when you went</p>
<p>Ambassador 1129 to the emperor 1130 , you made bold 1131</p>
<p>To carry into Flanders the great seal 1132 .</p>
<p>SURREY Item 1133 , you sent a large commission 1134</p>
<p>To Gregory de Cassado 1135 , to conclude</p>
<p>Without the king’s will or the state’s allowance 1136 ,</p>
<p>A league between his highness and Ferrara 1137 .</p>
<p>SUFFOLK That out of mere 1138 ambition, you have caused</p>
<p>Your holy hat to be stamped on the king’s coin.</p>
<p>SURREY Then, that you have sent innumerable substance 1139 —</p>
<p>By what means got, I leave to your own conscience —</p>
<p>To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways</p>
<p>You have for dignities 1140 , to the mere undoing</p>
<p>Of all the kingdom 1141 . Many more 1142 there are,</p>
<p>Which since they are of you, and odious,</p>
<p>I will not taint my mouth with.</p>
<p>CHAMBERLAIN O my lord,</p>
<p>Press not a falling man too far. ’Tis virtue 1143 :</p>
<p>His faults lie open 1144 to the laws, let them,</p>
<p>Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him</p>
<p>So little of his great self.</p>
<p>SURREY I forgive him.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Lord cardinal, the king’s further pleasure is,</p>
<p>Because all those things you have done of late</p>
<p>By your power legative 1145 within this kingdom,</p>
<p>Fall into th’compass of a praemunire 1146 ,</p>
<p>That therefore such a writ be sued 1147 against you,</p>
<p>To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements 1148 ,</p>
<p>Castles 1149 , and whatsoever, and to be</p>
<p>Out of the king’s protection. This is my charge 1150 .</p>
<p>NORFOLK And so we’ll leave you to your meditations</p>
<p>How to live better. For 1151 your stubborn answer</p>
<p>About the giving back the great seal to us,</p>
<p>The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.</p>
<p>So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.</p>
<p>Exeunt all but Wolsey</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY So farewell to the little good you bear me.</p>
<p>Farewell? A long farewell to all my greatness.</p>
<p>This is the state of man: today he puts forth</p>
<p>The tender 1152 leaves of hopes: tomorrow blossoms,</p>
<p>And bears his blushing 1153 honours thick upon him:</p>
<p>The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,</p>
<p>And when he thinks, good easy 1154 man, full surely</p>
<p>His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,</p>
<p>And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,</p>
<p>Like little wanton 1155 boys that swim on bladders 1156 ,</p>
<p>This 1157 many summers in a sea of glory,</p>
<p>But far beyond my depth: my high-blown 1158 pride</p>
<p>At length broke under me, and now has left me</p>
<p>Weary, and old with service, to the mercy</p>
<p>Of a rude stream 1159 , that must for ever hide me.</p>
<p>Vain 1160 pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:</p>
<p>I feel my heart new opened. O, how wretched</p>
<p>Is that poor man that hangs on princes’ favours?</p>
<p>There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,</p>
<p>That sweet aspect 1161 of princes, and their ruin 1162 ,</p>
<p>More pangs 1163 and fears than wars or women have:</p>
<p>And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer 1164 ,</p>
<p>Never to hope again.</p>
<p>Enter Cromwell, standing amazed 1165</p>
<p>Why, how now, Cromwell?</p>
<p>CROMWELL I have no power to speak, sir.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY What, amazed</p>
<p>At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder</p>
<p>A great man should decline 1166 ? Nay, an 1167 you weep</p>
<p>I am fall’n indeed.</p>
<p>CROMWELL How does your grace?</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Why, well:</p>
<p>Never so truly happy 1168 , my good Cromwell.</p>
<p>I know myself now, and I feel within me</p>
<p>A peace above all earthly dignities,</p>
<p>A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,</p>
<p>I humbly thank his grace, and from these shoulders,</p>
<p>These ruined pillars 1169 , out of pity, taken</p>
<p>A load would sink a navy: too much honour.</p>
<p>O, ’tis a burden, Cromwell, ’tis a burden</p>
<p>Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven.</p>
<p>CROMWELL I am glad your grace has made that right use of it 1170
.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,</p>
<p>Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,</p>
<p>To endure more miseries and greater far</p>
<p>Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.</p>
<p>What news abroad?</p>
<p>CROMWELL The heaviest 1171 and the worst</p>
<p>Is your displeasure 1172 with the king.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY God bless him.</p>
<p>CROMWELL The next is that 1173 Sir Thomas More is chosen</p>
<p>Lord Chancellor in your place.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY That’s somewhat sudden,</p>
<p>But he’s a learnèd man. May he continue</p>
<p>Long in his highness’ favour, and do justice</p>
<p>For truth’s sake and his conscience, that his bones,</p>
<p>When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,</p>
<p>May have a tomb of orphans 1174 ’ tears wept on him.</p>
<p>What more?</p>
<p>CROMWELL That Cranmer is returned with welcome,</p>
<p>Installed Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY That’s news indeed.</p>
<p>CROMWELL Last, that the Lady Anne,</p>
<p>Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,</p>
<p>This day was viewed in open 1175 as his queen,</p>
<p>Going to chapel, and the voice 1176 is now</p>
<p>Only about her coronation.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY There was the weight that pulled me down.</p>
<p>O Cromwell,</p>
<p>The king has gone beyond 1177 me: all my glories</p>
<p>In 1178 that one woman I have lost for ever.</p>
<p>No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,</p>
<p>Or gild again the noble troops 1179 that waited</p>
<p>Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell:</p>
<p>I am a poor fall’n man, unworthy now</p>
<p>To be thy lord and master. Seek the king —</p>
<p>That sun I pray may never set — I have told him</p>
<p>What and how true thou art: he will advance thee:</p>
<p>Some little memory of me will stir him —</p>
<p>I know his noble nature — not to let</p>
<p>Thy hopeful 1180 service perish too. Good Cromwell,</p>
<p>Neglect him not: make use 1181 now, and provide</p>
<p>For thine own future safety.</p>
<p>CROMWELL O my lord,</p>
<p>Must I then leave you? Must I needs forgo 1182</p>
<p>So good, so noble and so true a master?</p>
<p>Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,</p>
<p>With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.</p>
<p>The king shall have my service: but my prayers</p>
<p>For ever and for ever shall be yours.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear</p>
<p>He weeps</p>
<p>In all my miseries: but thou hast forced me,</p>
<p>Out of thy honest truth 1183 , to play the woman 1184 .</p>
<p>Let’s dry our eyes: and thus far hear me Cromwell,</p>
<p>And when I am forgotten, as I shall be,</p>
<p>And sleep in dull 1185 cold marble, where no mention</p>
<p>Of me more must be heard of, say I taught thee:</p>
<p>Say Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,</p>
<p>And sounded 1186 all the depths and shoals 1187 of honour,</p>
<p>Found thee a way, out of his wreck 1188 , to rise in:</p>
<p>A sure and safe one, though thy master missed it.</p>
<p>Mark 1189 but my fall, and that that ruined me:</p>
<p>Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:</p>
<p>By that sin fell the angels: how can man then,</p>
<p>The image of his maker, hope to win by it?</p>
<p>Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee:</p>
<p>Corruption wins not more than honesty.</p>
<p>Still 1190 in thy right hand carry gentle peace</p>
<p>To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:</p>
<p>Let all the ends thou aim’st at be thy country’s,</p>
<p>Thy God’s, and truth’s. Then if thou fall’st, O Cromwell,</p>
<p>Thou fall’st a blessèd martyr.</p>
<p>Serve the king: and prithee lead me in:</p>
<p>There take an inventory of all I have:</p>
<p>To the last penny ’tis the king’s. My robe,</p>
<p>And my integrity to heaven, is all</p>
<p>I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell,</p>
<p>Had I but served my God with half the zeal</p>
<p>I served my king, he would not in mine age</p>
<p>Have left me naked 1191 to mine enemies.</p>
<p>CROMWELL Good sir, have patience.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY So I have. Farewell</p>
<p>The hopes of court: my hopes in heaven do dwell.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
