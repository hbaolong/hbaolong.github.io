<p>Flourish. Enter Theseus, Pirithous, Hippolyta, Attendants</p>
<p>THESEUS Now let ’em enter and before the gods</p>
<p>Tender their holy prayers. Let the temples</p>
<p>Burn bright with sacred fires and the altars</p>
<p>In hallowed clouds commend their swelling 1234 incense</p>
<p>To those above us: let no due be wanting.</p>
<p>Flourish of cornets</p>
<p>They have a noble work in hand, will 1235 honour</p>
<p>The very powers that love ’em.</p>
<p>Enter Palamon and Arcite, and their Knights</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS Sir, they enter.</p>
<p>THESEUS You valiant and strong-hearted enemies</p>
<p>You royal german 1236 foes, that this day come</p>
<p>To blow that nearness 1237 out that flames between ye:</p>
<p>Lay by 1238 your anger for an hour, and, dove-like 1239 ,</p>
<p>Before the holy altars of your helpers,</p>
<p>The all-feared gods, bow down your stubborn 1240 bodies.</p>
<p>Your ire 1241 is more than mortal, so your help be:</p>
<p>And as the gods regard 1242 ye, fight with justice.</p>
<p>I’ll leave you to your prayers and betwixt ye</p>
<p>I part 1243 my wishes.</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS Honour crown the worthiest.</p>
<p>Exit Theseus and his train</p>
<p>PALAMON The glass 1244 is running now that cannot finish</p>
<p>To Arcite</p>
<p>Till one of us expire. Think you but thus:</p>
<p>That were there ought in me which strove to show 1245</p>
<p>Mine enemy in this business, were’t one eye</p>
<p>Against another, arm oppressed by arm,</p>
<p>I would destroy th’offender, coz, I would,</p>
<p>Though parcel 1246 of myself. Then from this gather</p>
<p>How I should tender 1247 you.</p>
<p>ARCITE I am in labour</p>
<p>To push your name, your ancient love, our kindred</p>
<p>Out of my memory and i’th’self-same place</p>
<p>To seat something I would confound 1248 . So hoist we</p>
<p>The sails that must these vessels port 1249 , even where</p>
<p>The heavenly limiter 1250 pleases.</p>
<p>PALAMON You speak well.</p>
<p>Before I turn 1251 , let me embrace thee, cousin.</p>
<p>This I shall never do again.</p>
<p>Embraces him</p>
<p>ARCITE One farewell.</p>
<p>PALAMON Why, let it be so. Farewell, coz.</p>
<p>Exeunt Palamon and his Knights</p>
<p>ARCITE Farewell, sir.—</p>
<p>Knights, kinsmen, lovers, yea my sacrifices 1252 ,</p>
<p>True worshippers of Mars, whose spirit in you</p>
<p>Expels the seeds of fear and th’apprehension 1253</p>
<p>Which still is father of it: go with me</p>
<p>Before the god of our profession 1254 : there</p>
<p>Require 1255 of him the hearts of lions and</p>
<p>The breath 1256 of tigers, yea, the fierceness too,</p>
<p>Yea, the speed also — to go on 1257 , I mean:</p>
<p>Else 1258 wish we to be snails. You know my prize</p>
<p>Must be dragged out of blood. Force and great feat 1259</p>
<p>Must put my garland 1260 on, where she sticks 1261</p>
<p>The queen of flowers 1262 . Our intercession 1263 then</p>
<p>Must be to him that makes the camp a cistern 1264</p>
<p>Brimmed with the blood of men. Give me your aid</p>
<p>And bend your spirits towards him.—</p>
<p>They kneel</p>
<p>Prostrate before the altar</p>
<p>Thou mighty one, that with thy power hast turned</p>
<p>Green Neptune 1265 into purple 1266 :</p>
<p>Whose havoc 1267 in vast field 1268 comets prewarn 1269 ,</p>
<p>Unearthèd 1270 skulls proclaim, whose breath blows down</p>
<p>The teeming 1271 Ceres 1272 ’ foison 1273 , who dost pluck</p>
<p>With hand armipotent 1274 from forth blue clouds</p>
<p>The masoned 1275 turrets, that both mak’st and break’st</p>
<p>The stony girths 1276 of cities: me thy pupil,</p>
<p>Youngest follower of thy drum, instruct this day</p>
<p>With military skill, that to thy laud 1277</p>
<p>I may advance my streamer 1278 , and by thee</p>
<p>Be styled 1279 the lord o’th’day. Give me, great Mars,</p>
<p>Some token of thy pleasure.</p>
<p>Here they fall on their faces as formerly, and there is heard
clanging of armour, with a short thunder, as the burst of a battle,
whereupon they all rise, and bow to the altar</p>
<p>O great corrector of enormous 1280 times,</p>
<p>Shaker of o’er-rank 1281 states, thou grand decider</p>
<p>Of dusty and old titles, that heal’st with blood 1282</p>
<p>The earth when it is sick and cur’st the world</p>
<p>O’th’pleurisy 1283 of people, I do take</p>
<p>Thy signs auspiciously and in thy name</p>
<p>To my design march boldly. Let us go.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Enter Palamon and his Knights, with the former observance</p>
<p>PALAMON Our stars 1284 must glister 1285 with new fire or be</p>
<p>Today extinct 1286 . Our argument is love,</p>
<p>Which if the goddess of it grant, she gives</p>
<p>Victory too. Then blend your spirits with mine,</p>
<p>You whose free 1287 nobleness do make my cause</p>
<p>Your personal hazard. To the goddess Venus</p>
<p>Commend we our proceeding and implore</p>
<p>Her power unto our party.—</p>
<p>Here they kneel as formerly</p>
<p>Hail, sovereign queen of secrets 1288 , who hast power</p>
<p>To call the fiercest tyrant from his rage</p>
<p>And weep unto a girl, that hast the might,</p>
<p>Even with an eye-glance, to choke Mars’s drum</p>
<p>And turn th’alarm to whispers, that canst make</p>
<p>A cripple flourish 1289 with his crutch and cure him</p>
<p>Before Apollo, that mayst force the king</p>
<p>To be his subject’s vassal 1290 and induce</p>
<p>Stale gravity 1291 to dance. The polled 1292 bachelor,</p>
<p>Whose youth like wanton boys through bonfires</p>
<p>Have skipped 1293 thy flame, at seventy, thou canst catch</p>
<p>And make him to the scorn of his hoarse throat</p>
<p>Abuse young lays 1294 of love: what godlike power</p>
<p>Hast thou not power upon? To Phoebus 1295 thou</p>
<p>Add’st flames hotter than his: the heavenly fires</p>
<p>Did scorch his mortal son 1296 , thine him: the huntress 1297</p>
<p>All moist 1298 and cold 1299 , some say, began to throw</p>
<p>Her bow away and sigh. Take to thy grace</p>
<p>Me thy vowed soldier, who do bear thy yoke 1300</p>
<p>As ’twere a wreath of roses, yet is heavier</p>
<p>Than lead itself, stings more than nettles.</p>
<p>I have never been foul-mouthed against thy law,</p>
<p>Nev’r revealed secret, for I knew none: would not,</p>
<p>Had I kenned 1301 all that were. I never practised</p>
<p>Upon 1302 man’s wife nor would the libels 1303 read</p>
<p>Of liberal 1304 wits. I never at great feasts</p>
<p>Sought to betray 1305 a beauty, but have blushed</p>
<p>At simpering sirs that did. I have been harsh</p>
<p>To large confessors 1306 and have hotly 1307 asked them</p>
<p>If they had mothers: I had one, a woman,</p>
<p>And women ’twere they wronged. I knew a man</p>
<p>Of eighty winters, this I told them, who</p>
<p>A lass of fourteen brided 1308 . ’Twas thy power</p>
<p>To put life into dust: the agèd cramp 1309</p>
<p>Had screwed 1310 his square 1311 foot round,</p>
<p>The gout had knit his fingers into knots,</p>
<p>Torturing convulsions from his globy 1312 eyes</p>
<p>Had almost drawn their spheres 1313 , that what was life</p>
<p>In him seemed torture. This anatomy 1314</p>
<p>Had by his young fair fere 1315 a boy, and I</p>
<p>Believed it was his, for she swore it was,</p>
<p>And who would not believe her? Brief 1316 , I am</p>
<p>To those that prate 1317 and have done, no companion:</p>
<p>To those that boast and have not, a defier 1318 :</p>
<p>To those that would and cannot, a rejoicer.</p>
<p>Yea, him I do not love that tells close offices 1319</p>
<p>The foulest way nor names concealments 1320 in</p>
<p>The boldest 1321 language. Such a one I am</p>
<p>And vow that lover never yet made sigh</p>
<p>Truer than I. O, then, most soft sweet goddess,</p>
<p>Give me the victory of this question, which</p>
<p>Is true love’s merit 1322 , and bless me with a sign</p>
<p>Of thy great pleasure.</p>
<p>Here music is heard, doves are seen to flutter. They fall again upon
their faces, then on their knees</p>
<p>O thou that from eleven to ninety reign’st</p>
<p>In mortal bosoms, whose chase 1323 is this world</p>
<p>And we in herds thy game: I give thee thanks</p>
<p>For this fair token, which being laid unto 1324</p>
<p>Mine innocent true heart, arms in assurance</p>
<p>My body to this business.— Let us rise</p>
<p>They rise</p>
<p>And bow before the goddess. Time comes on 1325 .</p>
<p>They bow. Exeunt</p>
<p>Still 1326 music of recorders. Enter Emilia in white, her hair about
her shoulders, a wheaten wreath; one in white holding up her train, her
hair stuck with flowers; one before her carrying a silver hind 1327 , in
which is conveyed incense and sweet odours, which being set upon the
altar, her Maids standing aloof 1328 , she sets fire to it; then they
curtsy and kneel</p>
<p>EMILIA O sacred, shadowy, cold and constant queen,</p>
<p>Abandoner of revels, mute contemplative,</p>
<p>Sweet, solitary, white as chaste, and pure</p>
<p>As wind-fanned snow, who to thy female knights</p>
<p>Allow’st no more blood than will make a blush,</p>
<p>Which is their order’s robe 1329 : I here, thy priest,</p>
<p>Am humbled ’fore thine altar. O, vouchsafe 1330</p>
<p>With that thy rare green eye, which never yet</p>
<p>Beheld thing maculate 1331 , look on thy virgin,</p>
<p>And, sacred silver mistress, lend thine ear,</p>
<p>Which ne’er heard scurrile 1332 term, into whose port 1333</p>
<p>Ne’er entered wanton 1334 sound, to my petition</p>
<p>Seasoned 1335 with holy fear 1336 . This is my last</p>
<p>Of vestal office. I am bride-habited 1337 ,</p>
<p>But maiden-hearted. A husband I have ’pointed 1338 ,</p>
<p>But do not know him. Out of two, I should</p>
<p>Choose one and pray for his success, but I</p>
<p>Am guiltless 1339 of election 1340 . Of mine eyes,</p>
<p>Were I to lose one, they are equal precious,</p>
<p>I could doom 1341 neither: that which perished should</p>
<p>Go to’t unsentenced. Therefore most modest queen,</p>
<p>He of the two pretenders 1342 that best loves me</p>
<p>And has the truest title 1343 in’t, let him</p>
<p>Take off my wheaten garland 1344 , or else grant</p>
<p>The file and quality 1345 I hold I may</p>
<p>Continue in thy band 1346 .—</p>
<p>Here the hind vanishes under the altar, and in the place ascends a
rose tree, having one rose upon it</p>
<p>See what our general of ebbs and flows 1347 ,</p>
<p>Out from the bowels of her holy altar,</p>
<p>With sacred act advances: but one rose!</p>
<p>If well inspired 1348 , this battle shall confound 1349</p>
<p>Both these brave knights and I, a virgin flower,</p>
<p>Must grow alone, unplucked.</p>
<p>Here is heard a sudden twang of instruments, and the rose falls from
the tree</p>
<p>The flower is fall’n, the tree descends.— O mistress,</p>
<p>Thou here dischargest me. I shall be gathered 1350 ,</p>
<p>I think so, but I know not thine own will:</p>
<p>Unclasp 1351 thy mystery!— I hope she’s pleased:</p>
<p>Her signs were gracious.</p>
<p>They curtsy and exeunt</p>
