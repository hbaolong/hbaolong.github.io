<p>Enter Gower and Williams</p>
<p>WILLIAMS I warrant it is to knight you, captain.</p>
<p>Enter Fluellen</p>
<p>FLUELLEN God’s will and his pleasure, captain, I beseech you now,
come apace 1708 to the king: there is more good toward you peradventure
1709 , than is in your knowledge to dream of.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS Sir, know you 1710 this glove?</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Know the glove? I know the glove is a glove.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS I know this, and thus I challenge it.</p>
<p>Strikes him</p>
<p>FLUELLEN ’Sblood 1711 , an arrant traitor as any’s in the universal
world, or in France, or in England!</p>
<p>GOWER How now, sir? You villain!</p>
<p>To Williams</p>
<p>WILLIAMS Do you think I’ll be forsworn 1712 ?</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Stand away 1713 , Captain Gower. I will give treason his
payment into ploughs 1714 , I warrant you.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS I am no traitor.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN That’s a lie in thy throat 1715 . I charge you in his
majesty’s name, apprehend him. He’s a friend of the Duke Alençon’s.</p>
<p>Enter Warwick and Gloucester</p>
<p>WARWICK How now, how now? What’s the matter?</p>
<p>FLUELLEN My lord of Warwick, here is —— praised be God for it! —— a
most contagious treason come to light, look you, as you shall desire in
a summer’s day 1716 . Here is his majesty.</p>
<p>Enter King and Exeter</p>
<p>KING HENRY V How now? What’s the matter?</p>
<p>FLUELLEN My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that, look your
grace, has struck the glove which your majesty is take out 1717 of the
helmet of Alençon.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS My liege, this was my glove, here is the fellow of it. And
he that I gave it to in change promised to wear it in his cap. I
promised to strike him, if he did. I met this man with my glove in his
cap, and I have been as good as my word.</p>
<p>Shows other glove</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Your majesty hear now, saving your majesty’s manhood, what
an arrant, rascally, beggarly, lousy knave it is. I hope your majesty is
pear 1718 me testimony and witness, and will avouchment 1719 , that this
is the glove of Alençon that your majesty is give 1720 me, in your
conscience, now.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Give me thy glove, soldier. Look, here is the fellow of
it.</p>
<p>Shows his glove</p>
<p>’Twas I, indeed, thou promisèd’st to strike,</p>
<p>And thou hast given me most bitter terms 1721 .</p>
<p>FLUELLEN An please your majesty, let his neck answer for it, if there
is any martial law in the world.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V How canst thou make me satisfaction 1722 ?</p>
<p>WILLIAMS All offences, my lord, come from the heart. Never came any
from mine that might offend your majesty.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V It was ourself thou didst abuse 1723 .</p>
<p>WILLIAMS Your majesty came not like yourself: you appeared to me but
as a common man; witness the night, your garments, your lowliness 1724 .
And what your highness suffered under that shape, I beseech you take it
for your own fault and not mine, for had you been as I took you for, I
made no offence: therefore, I beseech your highness, pardon me.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns,</p>
<p>And give it to this fellow.—— Keep it, fellow,</p>
<p>And wear it for an honour in thy cap</p>
<p>Till I do challenge it.—— Give him the crowns.——</p>
<p>Exeter gives</p>
<p>And captain, you must needs be friends with him.</p>
<p>Williams money</p>
<p>FLUELLEN By this day and this light, the fellow has mettle 1725
enough in his belly.—— Hold, there is twelve-pence for you, and I pray
you to serve God, and keep you out of prawls and prabbles 1726 and
quarrels and dissensions 1727 and, I warrant you, it is the better for
you.</p>
<p>Offers Williams</p>
<p>money</p>
<p>WILLIAMS I will 1728 none of your money.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN It is with a good will. I can tell you, it will serve you to
mend your shoes. Come, wherefore should you be so pashful? Your shoes is
not so good 1729 . ’Tis a good silling, I warrant you, or I will change
it.</p>
<p>Enter Herald</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Now, herald, are the dead numbered?</p>
<p>HERALD Here is the number of the slaughtered French.</p>
<p>Gives a paper</p>
<p>KING HENRY V What prisoners of good sort 1730 are taken, uncle?</p>
<p>EXETER ’Charles Duke of Orléans, nephew to the king,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>John Duke of Bourbon, and Lord Bouciqualt.</p>
<p>Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,</p>
<p>Full fifteen hundred, besides common men.’</p>
<p>KING HENRY V This note doth tell me of ten thousand French</p>
<p>That in the field lie slain: of princes, in this number,</p>
<p>And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead</p>
<p>One hundred twenty six: added to these,</p>
<p>Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,</p>
<p>Eight thousand and four hundred, of the which,</p>
<p>Five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights.</p>
<p>So that in these ten thousand they have lost,</p>
<p>There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries:</p>
<p>The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,</p>
<p>And gentlemen of blood 1731 and quality.</p>
<p>The names of those their nobles that lie dead:</p>
<p>Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France,</p>
<p>Jaques of Chatillion, Admiral 1732 of France,</p>
<p>The master of the cross-bows, Lord Rambures,</p>
<p>Great Master 1733 of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dolphin,</p>
<p>John Duke of Alençon, Anthony Duke of Brabant,</p>
<p>The brother to the Duke of Burgundy,</p>
<p>And Edward Duke of Bar. Of lusty 1734 earls,</p>
<p>Grandpré and Roussi, Fauconbridge and Foix,</p>
<p>Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.</p>
<p>Here was a royal fellowship of death.——</p>
<p>Where is the number of our English dead?——</p>
<p>Herald gives him another paper</p>
<p>’Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, Esquire’;</p>
<p>None else of name 1735 , and of all other men</p>
<p>But five-and-twenty. O God, thy arm 1736 was here.</p>
<p>And not to us, but to thy arm alone,</p>
<p>Ascribe we all! When, without stratagem 1737 ,</p>
<p>But in plain shock 1738 and even play 1739 of battle,</p>
<p>Was ever known so great and little loss</p>
<p>On one part and on th’other? Take it, God,</p>
<p>For it is none but thine.</p>
<p>EXETER ’Tis wonderful 1740 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Come, go we in procession to the village.</p>
<p>And be it death proclaimèd through our host</p>
<p>To boast of this or take that praise from God</p>
<p>Which is his only.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Is it not lawful, an please your majesty, to tell how many
is killed?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Yes, captain, but with this acknowledgement:</p>
<p>That God fought for us.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN Yes, my conscience, he did us great good.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Do we all holy rites.</p>
<p>Let there be sung Non nobis 1741 and Te Deum 1742 ,</p>
<p>The dead with charity enclosed in clay 1743 ,</p>
<p>And then to Calais, and to England then,</p>
<p>Where ne’er from France arrived more happy men.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
<p>Enter Chorus</p>
<p>CHORUS Vouchsafe 1744 to those that have not read the story,</p>
<p>That I may prompt them 1745 : and of such as have,</p>
<p>I humbly pray them to admit th’excuse</p>
<p>Of time 1746 , of numbers 1747 and due course of things 1748 ,</p>
<p>Which cannot in their huge and proper life 1749</p>
<p>Be here presented. Now we bear the king</p>
<p>Toward Calais: grant 1750 him there; there seen,</p>
<p>Heave him away upon your wingèd thoughts</p>
<p>Athwart 1751 the sea. Behold, the English beach</p>
<p>Pales 1752 in the flood 1753 with men, wives and boys,</p>
<p>Whose shouts and claps 1754 out-voice the deep-mouthed 1755 sea,</p>
<p>Which like a mighty whiffler 1756 ’fore the king</p>
<p>Seems to prepare his way. So let him land,</p>
<p>And solemnly 1757 see him set on to London.</p>
<p>So swift a pace hath thought that even now</p>
<p>You may imagine him upon Blackheath 1758 ,</p>
<p>Where that 1759 his lords desire him to have borne</p>
<p>His bruisèd 1760 helmet and his bended 1761 sword</p>
<p>Before him through the city. He forbids it,</p>
<p>Being free from vainness 1762 and self-glorious pride;</p>
<p>Giving full trophy 1763 , signal 1764 and ostent 1765</p>
<p>Quite from himself to God. But now behold,</p>
<p>In the quick forge and working-house 1766 of thought,</p>
<p>How London doth pour out her citizens.</p>
<p>The mayor and all his brethren 1767 in best sort 1768 ,</p>
<p>Like to the senators of th’antique 1769 Rome,</p>
<p>With the plebeians swarming at their heels,</p>
<p>Go forth and fetch their conqu’ring Caesar in:</p>
<p>As by a lower but by loving likelihood 1770 ,</p>
<p>Were now the general of our gracious empress 1771 ,</p>
<p>As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,</p>
<p>Bringing rebellion broachèd 1772 on his sword,</p>
<p>How many would the peaceful city quit,</p>
<p>To welcome him? Much 1773 more, and 1774 much more cause,</p>
<p>Did they this Harry. Now in London place him,</p>
<p>As yet the lamentation 1775 of the French</p>
<p>Invites 1776 the King of England’s stay at home:</p>
<p>The emperor’s coming 1777 in behalf of France,</p>
<p>To order peace between them 1778 . And omit 1779</p>
<p>All the occurrences, whatever chanced,</p>
<p>Till Harry’s back return again to France:</p>
<p>There must we bring him; and myself have played</p>
<p>The interim 1780 , by rememb’ring you ’tis past.</p>
<p>Then brook 1781 abridgment, and your eyes advance,</p>
<p>After your thoughts, straight back again to France.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
