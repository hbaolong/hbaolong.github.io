<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-7">Scene 1 / running scene 7</h4>
<p>Enter the [Second ] Merchant and [Angelo ] the goldsmith</p>
<p>ANGELO I am sorry, sir, that I have hindered you,</p>
<p>But I protest, he had the chain of 821 me,</p>
<p>Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.</p>
<p>SECOND MERCHANT How is the man esteemed here in the city?</p>
<p>ANGELO Of very reverend 822 reputation, sir,</p>
<p>Of credit infinite, highly beloved,</p>
<p>Second to none that lives here in the city:</p>
<p>His word might bear my wealth at any time 823 .</p>
<p>SECOND MERCHANT Speak softly, yonder, as I think, he walks.</p>
<p>Enter Antipholus and Dromio [of Syracuse ] again</p>
<p>Antipholus wearing the chain</p>
<p>ANGELO ’Tis so, and that self 824 chain about his neck</p>
<p>Which he forswore 825 most monstrously to have.</p>
<p>Good sir, draw near to me, I’ll speak to him.—</p>
<p>Signior Antipholus, I wonder much</p>
<p>That you would put me to this shame and trouble,</p>
<p>And not without some scandal to yourself,</p>
<p>With circumstance 826 and oaths so to deny</p>
<p>This chain, which now you wear so openly.</p>
<p>Beside 827 the charge 828 , the shame, imprisonment,</p>
<p>You have done wrong to this my honest friend,</p>
<p>Who, but for staying on 829 our controversy,</p>
<p>Had hoisted sail and put to sea today.</p>
<p>This chain you had of me, can you deny it?</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I think I had, I never did deny it.</p>
<p>SECOND MERCHANT Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?</p>
<p>SECOND MERCHANT These ears of mine, thou know’st did hear thee.</p>
<p>Fie 830 on thee, wretch, ’tis pity that thou liv’st</p>
<p>To walk where any honest men resort 831 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thou art a villain to impeach 832 me thus:</p>
<p>I’ll prove mine honour and mine honesty</p>
<p>Against thee presently 833 , if thou dar’st stand 834 .</p>
<p>SECOND MERCHANT I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.</p>
<p>They draw. Enter Adriana, Luciana, [the ] Courtesan and others</p>
<p>ADRIANA Hold, hurt him not, for God’s sake, he is mad.</p>
<p>Some get within him 835 , take his sword away.</p>
<p>Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Run, master, run, for God’s sake, take 836 a
house.</p>
<p>This is some priory. In, or we are spoiled 837 .</p>
<p>Exeunt [Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse ] to the priory</p>
<p>Enter [Emilia, the ] Lady Abbess</p>
<p>EMILIA Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?</p>
<p>ADRIANA To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.</p>
<p>Let us come in, that we may bind him fast</p>
<p>And bear him home for his recovery.</p>
<p>ANGELO I knew he was not in his perfect wits.</p>
<p>SECOND MERCHANT I am sorry now that I did draw 838 on him.</p>
<p>EMILIA How long hath this possession held the man?</p>
<p>ADRIANA This week he hath been heavy 839 , sour 840 , sad 841 ,</p>
<p>And much different from the man he was.</p>
<p>But till this afternoon his passion</p>
<p>Ne’er brake into extremity of rage.</p>
<p>EMILIA Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?</p>
<p>Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye</p>
<p>Strayed 842 his affection in unlawful 843 love,</p>
<p>A sin prevailing much in youthful men,</p>
<p>Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing?</p>
<p>Which of these sorrows is he subject to?</p>
<p>ADRIANA To none of these, except it be the last,</p>
<p>Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.</p>
<p>EMILIA You should for that have reprehended 844 him.</p>
<p>ADRIANA Why, so I did.</p>
<p>EMILIA Ay, but not rough enough.</p>
<p>ADRIANA As roughly as my modesty would let me.</p>
<p>EMILIA Haply 845 in private.</p>
<p>ADRIANA And in assemblies 846 too.</p>
<p>EMILIA Ay, but not enough.</p>
<p>ADRIANA It was the copy of our conference 847 .</p>
<p>In bed he slept not for my urging it,</p>
<p>At board 848 he fed not for my urging it.</p>
<p>Alone, it was the subject of my theme 849 ,</p>
<p>In company I often glancèd 850 it:</p>
<p>Still 851 did I tell him it was vile and bad.</p>
<p>EMILIA And thereof came it that the man was mad 852 .</p>
<p>The venom 853 clamours of a jealous woman</p>
<p>Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth.</p>
<p>It seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing 854 ,</p>
<p>And thereof comes it that his head is light 855 .</p>
<p>Thou say’st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:</p>
<p>Unquiet meals make ill digestions.</p>
<p>Thereof the raging fire of fever bred,</p>
<p>And what’s a fever but a fit of madness?</p>
<p>Thou say’st his sports 856 were hindered by thy brawls:</p>
<p>Sweet recreation barred, what doth ensue</p>
<p>But moody and dull melancholy,</p>
<p>Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,</p>
<p>And at her 857 heels a huge infectious troop</p>
<p>Of pale distemperatures 858 and foes to life?</p>
<p>In food, in sport and life-preserving 859 rest</p>
<p>To be disturbed, would mad or 860 man or beast.</p>
<p>The consequence is then thy jealous fits</p>
<p>Have scared thy husband from the use of 861 wits.</p>
<p>LUCIANA She never reprehended him but mildly,</p>
<p>When he demeaned 862 himself rough, rude 863 and wildly.</p>
<p>Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?</p>
<p>To Adriana</p>
<p>ADRIANA She did betray me to my own reproof 864 .</p>
<p>Good people enter and lay hold on him.</p>
<p>EMILIA No, not a creature enters in my house.</p>
<p>ADRIANA Then let your servants bring my husband forth.</p>
<p>EMILIA Neither. He took this place for sanctuary 865 ,</p>
<p>And it shall privilege 866 him from your hands</p>
<p>Till I have brought him to his wits again,</p>
<p>Or lose my labour 867 in assaying 868 it.</p>
<p>ADRIANA I will attend my husband, be his nurse,</p>
<p>Diet 869 his sickness, for it is my office 870 ,</p>
<p>And will have no attorney 871 but myself,</p>
<p>And therefore let me have him home with me.</p>
<p>EMILIA Be patient, for I will not let him stir</p>
<p>Till I have used the approvèd 872 means I have,</p>
<p>With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,</p>
<p>To make of him a formal 873 man again.</p>
<p>It is a branch 874 and parcel of mine oath,</p>
<p>A charitable duty of my order.</p>
<p>Therefore depart, and leave him here with me.</p>
<p>ADRIANA I will not hence and leave my husband here:</p>
<p>And ill it doth beseem your holiness</p>
<p>To separate the husband and the wife.</p>
<p>EMILIA Be quiet and depart, thou shalt not have him.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>LUCIANA Complain unto the duke of this indignity.</p>
<p>To Adriana</p>
<p>ADRIANA Come, go, I will fall prostrate at his feet,</p>
<p>And never rise until my tears and prayers</p>
<p>Have won his grace to come in person hither,</p>
<p>And take perforce 875 my husband from the abbess.</p>
<p>SECOND MERCHANT By this 876 , I think, the dial 877 points at
five:</p>
<p>Anon 878 , I’m sure the duke himself in person</p>
<p>Comes this way to the melancholy vale,</p>
<p>The place of death and sorry 879 execution,</p>
<p>Behind the ditches of the abbey here.</p>
<p>ANGELO Upon what cause?</p>
<p>SECOND MERCHANT To see a reverend Syracusan merchant,</p>
<p>Who put 880 unluckily into this bay</p>
<p>Against the laws and statutes of this town,</p>
<p>Beheaded publicly for his offence.</p>
<p>ANGELO See where they come: we will behold his death.</p>
<p>LUCIANA Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.</p>
<p>Enter the Duke of Ephesus and [Egeon ] the merchant of Syracuse,
bareheaded 881 [and bound ], with the Headsman 882 and other
Officers</p>
<p>DUKE Yet once again proclaim it publicly,</p>
<p>If any friend will pay the sum for him,</p>
<p>He shall not die, so much we tender 883 him.</p>
<p>ADRIANA Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess.</p>
<p>DUKE She is a virtuous and a reverend lady.</p>
<p>It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.</p>
<p>ADRIANA May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband —</p>
<p>Whom I made lord of me and all I had,</p>
<p>At your important 884 letters 885 — this ill day</p>
<p>A most outrageous 886 fit of madness took him,</p>
<p>That desp’rately 887 he hurried through the street,</p>
<p>With him his bondman 888 , all as mad as he,</p>
<p>Doing displeasure 889 to the citizens</p>
<p>By rushing in their houses, bearing thence 890</p>
<p>Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.</p>
<p>Once did I get him bound, and sent him home,</p>
<p>Whilst to take order 891 for the wrongs I went,</p>
<p>That here and there his fury had committed.</p>
<p>Anon, I wot 892 not by what strong escape,</p>
<p>He broke from those that had the guard of him,</p>
<p>And with his mad attendant and himself,</p>
<p>Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,</p>
<p>Met us again and madly bent 893 on us,</p>
<p>Chased us away: till raising of more aid,</p>
<p>We came again to bind them. Then they fled</p>
<p>Into this abbey, whither we pursued them,</p>
<p>And here the abbess shuts the gates on us,</p>
<p>And will not suffer 894 us to fetch him out,</p>
<p>Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.</p>
<p>Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command</p>
<p>Let him be brought forth, and borne hence for help 895 .</p>
<p>DUKE Long since thy husband served me in my wars,</p>
<p>And I to thee engaged 896 a prince’s word,</p>
<p>When thou didst make him master of thy bed,</p>
<p>To do him all the grace 897 and good I could.</p>
<p>Go some of you, knock at the abbey-gate,</p>
<p>And bid the lady abbess come to me.</p>
<p>I will determine 898 this before I stir 899 .</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER O, mistress, mistress, shift 900 and save yourself,</p>
<p>To Adriana</p>
<p>My master and his man are both broke loose,</p>
<p>Beaten the maids a-row 901 , and bound the doctor,</p>
<p>Whose beard they have singed off with brands 902 903 of fire,</p>
<p>And ever as it blazed, they threw on him</p>
<p>Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair.</p>
<p>My master preaches patience to him, and the while</p>
<p>His man with scissors nicks him like a fool 904 ,</p>
<p>And sure 905 , unless you send some present help,</p>
<p>Between them they will kill the conjurer.</p>
<p>ADRIANA Peace, fool, thy master and his man are here,</p>
<p>And that is false thou dost report to us.</p>
<p>MESSENGER Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true,</p>
<p>I have not breathed almost since I did see it.</p>
<p>He cries for you, and vows if he can take 906 you,</p>
<p>To scorch your face and to disfigure you.</p>
<p>Cry within</p>
<p>Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress: fly, be gone.</p>
<p>DUKE Come, stand by me, fear nothing.— Guard with halberds 907 .</p>
<p>ADRIANA Ay me, it is my husband: witness you,</p>
<p>That he is borne about 908 invisible.</p>
<p>Even now we housed him in the abbey here,</p>
<p>And now he’s there, past thought of human reason 909 .</p>
<p>Enter Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me
justice,</p>
<p>Even for the service that long since I did thee,</p>
<p>When I bestrid thee 910 in the wars, and took</p>
<p>Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood</p>
<p>That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.</p>
<p>EGEON Unless the fear of death doth make me dote 911 ,</p>
<p>I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Justice, sweet prince, against that woman
there:</p>
<p>She whom thou gav’st to me to be my wife,</p>
<p>That hath abusèd and dishonoured me,</p>
<p>Even in the strength and height of injury 912 .</p>
<p>Beyond imagination is the wrong</p>
<p>That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.</p>
<p>DUKE Discover 913 how, and thou shalt find me just.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon
me,</p>
<p>While she with harlots 914 feasted in my house.</p>
<p>DUKE A grievous fault: say, woman, didst thou so?</p>
<p>ADRIANA No, my good lord. Myself, he and my sister</p>
<p>Today did dine together. So befall my soul,</p>
<p>As this is false he burdens me withal 915 .</p>
<p>LUCIANA Ne’er may I look on 916 day, nor sleep on night,</p>
<p>But she tells to your highness simple truth.</p>
<p>ANGELO O perjured woman! They are both forsworn 917 ,</p>
<p>In this the madman justly chargeth 918 them.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS My liege, I am advisèd 919 what I say,</p>
<p>Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,</p>
<p>Nor heady-rash 920 , provoked with raging ire,</p>
<p>Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad 921 .</p>
<p>This woman locked me out this day from dinner;</p>
<p>That goldsmith there, were he not packed 922 with her,</p>
<p>Could witness 923 it, for he was with me then,</p>
<p>Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,</p>
<p>Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,</p>
<p>Where Balthazar and I did dine together.</p>
<p>Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,</p>
<p>I went to seek him. In the street I met him,</p>
<p>And in his company that gentleman.</p>
<p>Indicates Second Merchant</p>
<p>There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down 924</p>
<p>That I this day of him received the chain,</p>
<p>Which, God he knows, I saw not. For the which</p>
<p>He did arrest me with an officer.</p>
<p>I did obey, and sent my peasant 925 home</p>
<p>For certain 926 ducats: he with none returned.</p>
<p>Then fairly I bespoke 927 the officer</p>
<p>To go in person with me to my house.</p>
<p>By 928 th’way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more 929</p>
<p>Of vile confederates. Along with them</p>
<p>They brought one Pinch, a hungry 930 lean-faced villain,</p>
<p>A mere anatomy 931 , a mountebank 932 ,</p>
<p>A threadbare 933 juggler 934 and a fortune-teller,</p>
<p>A needy 935 , hollow-eyed, sharp-looking 936 wretch,</p>
<p>A living dead man. This pernicious 937 slave,</p>
<p>Forsooth 938 , took on him as 939 a conjurer 940 ,</p>
<p>And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,</p>
<p>And with no face, as ’twere, outfacing me 941 ,</p>
<p>Cries out, I was possessed. Then all together</p>
<p>They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,</p>
<p>And in a dark and dankish 942 vault 943 at home</p>
<p>There left me and my man, both bound together,</p>
<p>Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder 944 ,</p>
<p>I gained my freedom, and immediately</p>
<p>Ran hither to your grace, whom I beseech</p>
<p>To give me ample satisfaction</p>
<p>For these deep shames and great indignities.</p>
<p>ANGELO My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,</p>
<p>That he dined not at home, but was locked out.</p>
<p>DUKE But had he such a chain of thee, or no?</p>
<p>ANGELO He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,</p>
<p>These people saw the chain about his neck.</p>
<p>SECOND MERCHANT Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine</p>
<p>To Antipholus</p>
<p>Heard you confess you had the chain of him,</p>
<p>After you first forswore it on the mart,</p>
<p>And thereupon I drew my sword on you:</p>
<p>And then you fled into this abbey here,</p>
<p>From whence I think you are come by miracle.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I never came within these abbey walls,</p>
<p>Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:</p>
<p>I never saw the chain, so help me heaven,</p>
<p>And this is false you burden me withal.</p>
<p>DUKE Why, what an intricate impeach 945 is this?</p>
<p>I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup 946 .</p>
<p>If here you housed him, here he would have been.</p>
<p>If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly 947 .</p>
<p>You say he dined at home, the goldsmith here</p>
<p>To Adriana</p>
<p>Denies that saying.— Sirrah, what say you?</p>
<p>To Dromio</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Sir, he dined with her there, at the
Porpentine.</p>
<p>COURTESAN He did, and from my finger snatched that ring.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS ’Tis true, my liege, this ring I had of
her.</p>
<p>DUKE Saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here?</p>
<p>COURTESAN As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.</p>
<p>DUKE Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.</p>
<p>I think you are all mated 948 , or stark mad.</p>
<p>Exit one to the Abbess</p>
<p>EGEON Most mighty duke, vouchsafe 949 me speak a word:</p>
<p>Haply 950 I see a friend will save my life,</p>
<p>And pay the sum that may deliver me.</p>
<p>DUKE Speak freely, Syracusan, what thou wilt.</p>
<p>EGEON Is not your name, sir, called Antipholus?</p>
<p>And is not that your bondman, Dromio?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Within this hour I was his bondman 951 sir,</p>
<p>But he, I thank him, gnawed in two my cords,</p>
<p>Now am I Dromio, and his man unbound.</p>
<p>EGEON I am sure you both of you remember me.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you 952 ,</p>
<p>For lately we were bound as you are now.</p>
<p>You are not Pinch’s patient, are you, sir?</p>
<p>EGEON Why look you strange 953 on me? You know me well.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS I never saw you in my life till now.</p>
<p>EGEON O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,</p>
<p>And careful 954 hours with time’s deformèd 955 hand</p>
<p>Have written strange defeatures 956 in my face.</p>
<p>But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Neither 957 .</p>
<p>EGEON Dromio, nor thou?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS No, trust me, sir, nor I.</p>
<p>EGEON I am sure thou dost.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not, and whatsoever a
man denies, you are now bound 958 to believe him.</p>
<p>EGEON Not know my voice? O time’s extremity,</p>
<p>Hast thou so cracked and splitted my poor tongue 959</p>
<p>In seven short years 960 that here my only son</p>
<p>Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares 961 ?</p>
<p>Though now this grainèd 962 face of mine be hid</p>
<p>In sap-consuming winter’s drizzled snow 963 ,</p>
<p>And all the conduits 964 of my blood froze up,</p>
<p>Yet hath my night of life 965 some memory,</p>
<p>My wasting lamps 966 some fading glimmer left,</p>
<p>My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:</p>
<p>All these old witnesses — I cannot err —</p>
<p>Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I never saw my father in my life.</p>
<p>EGEON But 967 seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,</p>
<p>Thou know’st we parted, but perhaps, my son,</p>
<p>Thou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS The duke, and all that know me in the city,</p>
<p>Can witness with me that it is not so.</p>
<p>I ne’er saw Syracusa in my life.</p>
<p>DUKE I tell thee, Syracusan, twenty years</p>
<p>Have I been patron to Antipholus,</p>
<p>During which time he ne’er saw Syracusa:</p>
<p>I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.</p>
<p>Enter the Abbess [Emilia ], with Antipholus and Dromio of
Syracuse</p>
<p>EMILIA Most mighty duke, behold a man much wronged.</p>
<p>All gather to see them</p>
<p>ADRIANA I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.</p>
<p>DUKE One of these men is genius 968 to the other:</p>
<p>And so of these, which is the natural man,</p>
<p>And which the spirit? Who deciphers 969 them?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I, sir, am Dromio, command him away.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS I, sir, am Dromio, pray let me stay.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Egeon art thou not? Or else his ghost.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O, my old master, who hath bound him here?</p>
<p>EMILIA Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,</p>
<p>And gain a husband by his liberty.</p>
<p>Speak, old Egeon, if thou be’st the man</p>
<p>That hadst a wife once called Emilia,</p>
<p>That bore thee at a burden 970 two fair sons?</p>
<p>O, if thou be’st the same Egeon, speak,</p>
<p>And speak unto the same Emilia.</p>
<p>DUKE Why, here begins his morning story 971 right 972 :</p>
<p>These two Antipholuses, these two so like,</p>
<p>And these two Dromios, one in semblance 973 —</p>
<p>Besides her urging of 974 her wreck at sea —</p>
<p>These are the parents to these children,</p>
<p>Which accidentally are met together.</p>
<p>EGEON If I dream not, thou art Emilia.</p>
<p>If thou art she, tell me where is that son</p>
<p>That floated with thee on the fatal raft?</p>
<p>EMILIA By men of Epidamium, he and I</p>
<p>And the twin Dromio, all were taken up;</p>
<p>But by and by, rude 975 fishermen of Corinth</p>
<p>By force took Dromio and my son from them,</p>
<p>And me they left with those of Epidamium.</p>
<p>What then became of them, I cannot tell,</p>
<p>I to this fortune that you see me in.</p>
<p>DUKE Antipholus, thou cam’st from Corinth first.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE No, sir, not I, I came from Syracuse.</p>
<p>DUKE Stay 976 , stand apart, I know not which is which.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS And I with him.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Brought to this town by that most famous
warrior,</p>
<p>Duke Menaphon 977 , your most renownèd uncle.</p>
<p>ADRIANA Which of you two did dine with me today?</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I, gentle mistress.</p>
<p>ADRIANA And are not you my husband?</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS No, I say nay to that.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE And so do I, yet did she call me so.</p>
<p>And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,</p>
<p>Did call me brother.— What I told you then,</p>
<p>To Luciana</p>
<p>I hope I shall have leisure 978 to make good,</p>
<p>If this be not a dream I see and hear.</p>
<p>ANGELO That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.</p>
<p>Points to chain</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I think it be, sir, I deny it not.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.</p>
<p>To Angelo</p>
<p>ANGELO I think I did, sir, I deny it not.</p>
<p>ADRIANA I sent you money, sir, to be your bail</p>
<p>To Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p>By Dromio, but I think he brought it not.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS No, none by me.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE This purse of ducats I received from you,</p>
<p>To Adriana</p>
<p>And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.</p>
<p>Shows purse</p>
<p>I see we still 979 did meet each other’s man,</p>
<p>And I was ta’en for him, and he for me,</p>
<p>And thereupon these errors are arose 980 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS These ducats pawn I for my father here.</p>
<p>Offers money</p>
<p>DUKE It shall not need, thy father hath his life.</p>
<p>COURTESAN Sir, I must have that diamond from you.</p>
<p>To Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS There, take it, and much thanks for my good
cheer 981 .</p>
<p>Gives ring</p>
<p>EMILIA Renownèd duke, vouchsafe to take the pains</p>
<p>To go with us into the abbey here,</p>
<p>And hear at large discoursèd all our fortunes.</p>
<p>And all that are assembled in this place,</p>
<p>That by this sympathizèd 982 one day’s error</p>
<p>Have suffered wrong, go, keep us company,</p>
<p>And we shall make full satisfaction 983 .</p>
<p>Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail 984</p>
<p>Of you, my sons, and till this present hour</p>
<p>My heavy burden ne’er deliverèd.</p>
<p>The duke, my husband, and my children both,</p>
<p>And you the calendars of their nativity 985 ,</p>
<p>Go to a gossips’ 986 feast, and joy 987 with me,</p>
<p>After so long grief, such festivity.</p>
<p>DUKE With all my heart, I’ll gossip at 988 this feast.</p>
<p>Exeunt all. The two Dromios and two brothers [Antipholus ] remain</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Master, shall I fetch your stuff from
shipboard?</p>
<p>To Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embarked
989 ?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Your goods that lay at host 990 , sir, in the
Centaur.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE He speaks to me, I am your master, Dromio.</p>
<p>Come, go with us, we’ll look to that anon.</p>
<p>Embrace thy brother there, rejoice with him.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus ]</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE There is a fat friend 991 at your master’s
house,</p>
<p>That kitchened me 992 for you today at dinner.</p>
<p>She now shall be my sister 993 , not my wife.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Methinks you are my glass 994 , and not my
brother:</p>
<p>I see by you, I am a sweet-faced youth.</p>
<p>Will you walk in to see their gossiping?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Not I, sir, you are my elder.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS That’s a question, how shall we try it?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE We’ll draw cuts 995 for the senior, till then,
lead thou first.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Nay then, thus:</p>
<p>We came into the world like brother and brother,</p>
<p>And now let’s go hand in hand, not one before another.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster , and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading ‘bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
<p>“This new Complete Works from the RSC is a glorious edition of one of
the world’s most important books. It’s the essential reference book for
anyone who’s ever been in love, felt jealousy, fear, hatred, or desire.
All human life is here - and every home should have one.“</p>
<p>—— Dame Judi Dench</p>
<p>“莎士比亚作品是全世界最重要的著作之一，皇家莎士比亚剧团推出的新版《莎士比亚全集》为其再添一笔华彩。但凡恋爱过、嫉妒过、恐惧过、厌憎过、渴望过的人，皆可从中找到共鸣；人生百态，世间风韵，都能在这里寻到踪影——它的确值得每个家庭拥有。”</p>
<p>——朱迪·丹奇女爵士</p>
<p>“Thanks to Bate and Rasmussen, we now have a rendering of the
Complete Works that, in a rare publishing achievement, would also give
complete satisfaction to the author himself.“</p>
<p>—— Robert McCrum, The Observer</p>
<p>“感谢贝特和拉斯姆森两位编者为我们奉上这版《莎士比亚全集》，它的成就堪称出版界罕有，即便莎翁本人也无可挑剔。”</p>
<p>——罗伯特·麦克拉姆，《观察家报》</p>
