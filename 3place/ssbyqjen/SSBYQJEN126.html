<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-13">Scene 1 ／ running scene 13</h4>
<p>Enter Leonato and his brother [Antonio ]</p>
<p>ANTONIO If you go on thus, you will kill yourself,</p>
<p>And ’tis not wisdom thus to second 901 grief</p>
<p>Against yourself.</p>
<p>LEONATO I pray thee, cease thy counsel,</p>
<p>Which falls into mine ears as profitless</p>
<p>As water in a sieve: give not me counsel,</p>
<p>Nor let no comforter delight mine ear</p>
<p>But such a one whose wrongs do suit with 902 mine.</p>
<p>Bring me a father that so loved his child,</p>
<p>Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine,</p>
<p>And bid him speak of patience,</p>
<p>Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,</p>
<p>And let it answer 903 every strain 904 for strain,</p>
<p>As thus for thus, and such a grief for such,</p>
<p>In every lineament 905 , branch 906 , shape and form.</p>
<p>If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,</p>
<p>Bid sorrow wag 907 , cry ‘Hem!’ 908 when he should groan,</p>
<p>Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk</p>
<p>With candle-wasters 909 , bring him yet to me,</p>
<p>And I of him will gather patience.</p>
<p>But there is no such man: for, brother, men</p>
<p>Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief</p>
<p>Which they themselves not feel, but tasting it,</p>
<p>Their counsel turns to passion 910 , which before</p>
<p>Would give preceptial 911 medicine to rage,</p>
<p>Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,</p>
<p>Charm ache with air and agony with words.</p>
<p>No, no, ’tis all men’s office to speak patience</p>
<p>To those that wring 912 under the load of sorrow,</p>
<p>But no man’s virtue nor sufficiency 913</p>
<p>To be so moral 914 when he shall endure</p>
<p>The like himself: therefore give me no counsel.</p>
<p>My griefs cry louder than advertisement 915 .</p>
<p>ANTONIO Therein do men from children nothing differ.</p>
<p>LEONATO I pray thee peace 916 . I will be flesh and blood,</p>
<p>For there was never yet philosopher</p>
<p>That could endure the toothache patiently,</p>
<p>However 917 they have writ the style of 918 gods</p>
<p>And made a push at 919 chance and sufferance 920 .</p>
<p>ANTONIO Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself,</p>
<p>Make those that do offend you suffer too.</p>
<p>LEONATO There thou speak’st reason. Nay, I will do so.</p>
<p>My soul doth tell me Hero is belied,</p>
<p>And that shall Claudio know, so shall the prince</p>
<p>And all of them that thus dishonour her.</p>
<p>Enter Prince [Don Pedro ] and Claudio</p>
<p>ANTONIO Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Good den, good den.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Good day to both of you.</p>
<p>LEONATO Hear you, my lords—</p>
<p>DON PEDRO We have 921 some haste, Leonato.</p>
<p>LEONATO Some haste, my lord! Well, fare you well, my lord:</p>
<p>Are you so hasty now? Well, all is one 922 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.</p>
<p>ANTONIO If he could right himself with quarrelling,</p>
<p>Some of us 923 would lie low.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Who wrongs him?</p>
<p>LEONATO Marry, thou dost wrong me, thou dissembler 924 , thou:</p>
<p>Claudio prepares to draw his sword</p>
<p>Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword,</p>
<p>I fear thee not.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Marry, beshrew 925 my hand</p>
<p>If it should give your age such cause of fear:</p>
<p>In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword 926 .</p>
<p>LEONATO Tush, tush, man, never fleer 927 and jest at me:</p>
<p>I speak not like a dotard 928 nor a fool,</p>
<p>As under privilege of age to brag</p>
<p>What I have done being young or what would do</p>
<p>Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head 929 ,</p>
<p>Thou hast so wronged my innocent child and me</p>
<p>That I am forced to lay my reverence 930 by,</p>
<p>And with grey hairs and bruise of many days,</p>
<p>Do challenge thee to trial of a man 931 .</p>
<p>I say thou hast belied mine innocent child:</p>
<p>Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,</p>
<p>And she lies buried with her ancestors —</p>
<p>O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,</p>
<p>Save this of hers, framed by thy villainy!</p>
<p>CLAUDIO My villainy?</p>
<p>LEONATO Thine, Claudio, thine, I say.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO You say not right, old man.</p>
<p>LEONATO My lord, my lord,</p>
<p>I’ll prove it on his body if he dare,</p>
<p>Despite his nice fence 932 and his active practice,</p>
<p>His May of youth and bloom of lustihood 933 .</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Away! I will not have to do with you.</p>
<p>LEONATO Canst thou so daff 934 me? Thou hast killed my child:</p>
<p>If thou kill’st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.</p>
<p>ANTONIO He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:</p>
<p>But that’s no matter, let him kill one first.</p>
<p>Win me and wear me 935 , let him answer me.</p>
<p>Come follow me, boy, come, sir boy, come follow me:</p>
<p>Sir boy, I’ll whip you from your foining fence 936 ,</p>
<p>Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.</p>
<p>LEONATO Brother—</p>
<p>ANTONIO Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece,</p>
<p>And she is dead, slandered to death by villains,</p>
<p>That dare as well answer a man indeed</p>
<p>As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.</p>
<p>Boys, apes, braggarts 937 , Jacks 938 , milksops 939 !</p>
<p>LEONATO Brother Antony—</p>
<p>ANTONIO Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,</p>
<p>And what they weigh 940 , even to the utmost scruple 941 ,</p>
<p>Scrambling 942 , out-facing 943 , fashion-monging 944 boys,</p>
<p>That lie and cog 945 and flout 946 , deprave 947 and slander,</p>
<p>Go anticly 948 , and show outward hideousness,</p>
<p>And speak off 949 half a dozen dang’rous words,</p>
<p>How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst 950 ,</p>
<p>And this is all.</p>
<p>LEONATO But, brother Antony—</p>
<p>ANTONIO Come, ’tis no matter:</p>
<p>Do not you meddle, let me deal in this.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience 951 .</p>
<p>My heart is sorry for your daughter’s death.</p>
<p>But on my honour, she was charged with nothing</p>
<p>But what was true, and very full of proof.</p>
<p>LEONATO My lord, my lord—</p>
<p>DON PEDRO I will not hear you.</p>
<p>Enter Benedick</p>
<p>LEONATO No? Come, brother, away! I will be heard.</p>
<p>ANTONIO And shall, or some of us will smart for it.</p>
<p>Exeunt both [Leonato and Antonio ]</p>
<p>DON PEDRO See, see, here comes the man we went to seek.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Now, signior, what news?</p>
<p>BENEDICK Good day, my lord.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part almost a
fray.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO We had like to have 952 had our two noses snapped off with
953 two old men without teeth.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Leonato and his brother. What think’st thou? Had we fought,
I doubt 954 we should have been too young for them.</p>
<p>BENEDICK In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came to seek
you both.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO We have been up and down to seek thee, for we are high-proof
955 melancholy and would fain have it beaten away. Wilt thou use thy
wit?</p>
<p>BENEDICK It is in my scabbard: shall I draw 956 it?</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Never any did so, though very many have been beside their wit
957 . I will bid thee draw, as we do the minstrels 958 , draw to
pleasure us.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou sick, or
angry?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO What, courage, man! What though care 959 killed a cat 960 ,
thou hast mettle 961 enough in thee to kill care.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career 962 , an 963 you
charge 964 it against me. I pray you choose another subject.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Nay then, give him another staff 965 : this last was broke
cross 966 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO By this light, he changes more and more: I think he be
angry indeed.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle 967 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK Shall I speak a word in your ear?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO God bless me from a challenge!</p>
<p>BENEDICK You are a villain. I jest not: I will make it good how you
dare, with what you dare, and when you dare. Do me right 968 , or I will
protest 969 your cowardice. You have killed a sweet lady, and her death
shall fall heavy on you. Let me hear from you.</p>
<p>Aside to Claudio</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Well, I will meet you, so 970 I may have good cheer 971 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO What? A feast, a feast?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO I’faith, I thank him: he hath bid me to a calf’s head and a
capon 972 , the which if I do not carve most curiously 973 , say my
knife’s naught. Shall I not find a woodcock 974 too?</p>
<p>BENEDICK Sir, your wit ambles 975 well, it goes easily 976 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO I’ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the other day:
I said, thou hadst a fine 977 wit 978 . ‘True,’ says she, ‘a fine little
one.’ ‘No,’ said I, ‘a great wit.’ ‘Right,’ says she, ‘a great gross
one.’ ‘Nay,’ said I, ‘a good wit.’ ‘Just,’ said she, ‘it hurts nobody.’
‘Nay,’ said I, ‘the gentleman is wise.’ ‘Certain,’ said she, ‘a wise
gentleman 979 .’ ‘Nay,’ said I, ‘he hath the tongues 980 .’ ‘That I
believe,’ said she, ‘for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which
he forswore 981 on Tuesday morning: there’s a double 982 tongue, there’s
two tongues.’ Thus did she, an hour together, transshape 983 thy
particular virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the
properest 984 man in Italy.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Yea, that she did: but yet for all that, an if she did not
hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old 985 man’s daughter
told us all.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO All, all, and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the
garden 986 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO But when shall we set the savage bull’s horns on the
sensible Benedick’s head?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Yea, and text underneath, ‘Here dwells Benedick the married
man 987’?</p>
<p>BENEDICK Fare you well, boy, you know my mind. I will leave you now
to your gossip-like humour. You break jests as braggarts do their blades
988 , which God be thanked, hurt not. My lord 989 , for your many
courtesies I thank you. I must discontinue your company. Your brother
the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among you killed a sweet and
innocent lady. For my Lord Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and
till then, peace be with him.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>DON PEDRO He is in earnest.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO In most profound earnest, and I’ll warrant you, for the love
of Beatrice.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO And hath challenged thee.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Most sincerely.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and
hose 990 and leaves off his wit!</p>
<p>Enter Constable [Dogberry, Verges and the Watch, with ] Conrad and
Borachio</p>
<p>CLAUDIO He is then a giant to an ape, but then is an ape a doctor to
such a man 991 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO But, soft you 992 , let me be: pluck up 993 , my heart, and
be sad 994 . Did he not say my brother was fled?</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she shall ne’er
weigh more reasons 995 in her balance 996 . Nay, an you be a cursing 997
hypocrite once, you must be looked to.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO How now? Two of my brother’s men bound? Borachio one!</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Hearken 998 after their offence, my lord.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Officers, what offence have these men done?</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Marry, sir, they have committed false report 999 , moreover,
they have spoken untruths, secondarily, they are slanders 1000 , sixth
and lastly, they have belied a lady, thirdly, they have verified unjust
things, and to conclude, they are lying knaves.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO First, I ask thee what they have done, thirdly, I ask thee
what’s their offence, sixth and lastly, why they are committed, and to
conclude, what you lay to their charge.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Rightly reasoned, and in his own division 1001 . And by my
troth, there’s one meaning well suited.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound
1002 to your answer 1003 ? This learned constable is too cunning 1004 to
be understood. What’s your offence?</p>
<p>BORACHIO Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer. Do you
hear me, and let this count kill me. I have deceived even your very
eyes. What your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have
brought to light, who in the night overheard me confessing to this man,
how Don John your brother incensed 1005 me to slander the Lady Hero, how
you were brought into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero’s
garments, how you disgraced her when you should marry her. My villainy
they have upon record, which I had rather seal with my death than repeat
over to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master’s false
accusation, and briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a
villain.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?</p>
<p>To Claudio</p>
<p>CLAUDIO I have drunk poison whiles he uttered it.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO But did my brother set thee on to this?</p>
<p>To Borachio</p>
<p>BORACHIO Yea, and paid me richly for the practice of it.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO He is composed and framed of treachery, And fled he is upon
this villainy.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Sweet Hero! Now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance
1006 that I loved it first.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Come, bring away the plaintiffs 1007 . By this time our
sexton hath reformed 1008 Signior Leonato of the matter. And masters, do
not forget to specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an
ass.</p>
<p>VERGES Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and the sexton
too.</p>
<p>Enter Leonato [and Antonio, with the Sexton ]</p>
<p>LEONATO Which is the villain? Let me see his eyes,</p>
<p>That, when I note another man like him,</p>
<p>I may avoid him. Which of these is he?</p>
<p>BORACHIO If you would know your wronger, look on me.</p>
<p>LEONATO Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed</p>
<p>Mine innocent child?</p>
<p>BORACHIO Yea, even I alone.</p>
<p>LEONATO No, not so, villain, thou beliest thyself:</p>
<p>Here stand a pair of honourable men 1009 ,</p>
<p>A third is fled, that had a hand in it.</p>
<p>I thank you, princes, for my daughter’s death.</p>
<p>Record it with your high and worthy deeds,</p>
<p>’Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO I know not how to pray your patience,</p>
<p>Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself,</p>
<p>Impose me to 1010 what penance your invention</p>
<p>Can lay upon my sin. Yet sinned I not</p>
<p>But in mistaking.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO By my soul, nor I.</p>
<p>And yet, to satisfy this good old man,</p>
<p>I would bend under any heavy weight</p>
<p>That he’ll enjoin me to.</p>
<p>LEONATO I cannot bid you bid my daughter live —</p>
<p>That were impossible — but I pray you both,</p>
<p>Possess 1011 the people in Messina here</p>
<p>How innocent she died, and if your love</p>
<p>Can labour aught 1012 in sad invention 1013 ,</p>
<p>Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb,</p>
<p>And sing it to her bones, sing it tonight:</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning come you to my house,</p>
<p>And since you could not be my son-in-law,</p>
<p>Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter,</p>
<p>Almost the copy of my child that’s dead,</p>
<p>And she alone is heir to both of us:</p>
<p>Give her the right 1014 you should have giv’n her cousin,</p>
<p>And so dies my revenge.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO O noble sir,</p>
<p>Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!</p>
<p>I do embrace your offer and dispose 1015</p>
<p>For henceforth of poor Claudio.</p>
<p>LEONATO Tomorrow then I will expect your coming,</p>
<p>Tonight I take my leave. This naughty man</p>
<p>Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,</p>
<p>Who I believe was packed 1016 in all this wrong,</p>
<p>Hired to it by your brother.</p>
<p>BORACHIO No, by my soul, she was not,</p>
<p>Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,</p>
<p>But always hath been just and virtuous</p>
<p>In anything that I do know by her.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and black
1017 , this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass. I beseech you
let it be remembered in his punishment. And also the watch heard them
talk of one Deformed: they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock
hanging by it 1018 , and borrows money in God’s name 1019 , the which he
hath used so long and never paid that now men grow hard- hearted and
will lend nothing for God’s sake. Pray you examine him upon that
point.</p>
<p>LEONATO I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverend youth,
and I praise God for you.</p>
<p>LEONATO There’s for thy pains.</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>DOGBERRY God save the foundation! 1020</p>
<p>LEONATO Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.</p>
<p>DOGBERRY I leave an arrant knave with your worship, which I beseech
your worship to correct yourself, for the example of others. God keep
your worship! I wish your worship well. God restore you to health! I
humbly give you 1021 leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be
wished, God prohibit 1022 it! Come, neighbour.</p>
<p>LEONATO Until tomorrow morning, lords, farewell.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Dogberry and Verges ]</p>
<p>ANTONIO Farewell, my lords: we look for 1023 you tomorrow.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO We will not fail.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Tonight I’ll mourn with Hero.</p>
<p>LEONATO Bring you these fellows on.— We’ll talk with Margaret,</p>
<p>To the Watch</p>
<p>How her acquaintance grew with this lewd 1024 fellow.</p>
<p>Exeunt [separately ]</p>
