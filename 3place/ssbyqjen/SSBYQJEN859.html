<h4 id="introduction-to-the-tragedy-of-richard-the-third">Introduction
to The Tragedy of Richard the Third</h4>
<p>Shakespeare’s first group of historical plays comes to a harmonious
conclusion with the defeat of wicked King Richard at the battle of
Bosworth Field in 1485. The victorious Henry, Earl of Richmond, belongs
to the House of Lancaster. He marries the Princess Elizabeth, of the
House of York, thus unifying the nobility and bringing to an end the
Wars of the Roses. In the final scene of Richard the Third , the Lord
Stanley, Earl of Derby, places the crown on Richmond’s head and he
becomes King Henry VII, inaugurator of the Tudor dynasty. The play
closes with a speech in which Henry looks back on the civil strife that
has been the subject not just of this play but also of the Henry VI
sequence, and forward to the golden age over which his wife’s namesake,
Queen Elizabeth, liked to believe that she reigned. On hearing these
lines, Shakespeare’s audience would themselves have looked both forward
and back: back to a bloody period in the nation’s history, with relief
at how it was providentially ended by the Tudor dispensation; forward to
an uncertain future, in the knowledge that the queen was now too old to
sustain the line.</p>
<p>Historians still debate the question of how villainous Richard III
really was, and in particular whether he personally ordered the slaying
of the princes in the Tower. What is not in doubt is that it was
convenient for the Tudors to paint him as a villain, in order to make
his opponent, the future Henry VII, into a hero and a saint. Sir Thomas
More played a major part in the process with his History of King Richard
III , written at the court of Richmond’s son, Henry VIII. Shakespeare
finished the work, immortalizing Richard as the scheming Crookback, in
the public theatre of Henry VIII’s younger daughter. The English are
notorious for getting their theology from Milton and their history from
Shakespeare, rather than from more orthodox sources. The endurance of
the image of a Richard who is ‘determinèd to prove a villain’ is
testimony to the power of drama to be more memorable than written
history. Richard the Third is one of those core Shakespearean plays that
everybody has heard of, even if they have never read it. The success of
two film versions – first Sir Laurence Olivier’s and subsequently Sir
Ian McKellen’s dazzling update to the fascist 1930s – has assured its
continuing life.</p>
<p>As in the Henry VI plays, the language is frequently elevated and
highly rhetorical. The combination of formal language and a sense of
symmetry in the events – action leading to reaction, bloody violence to
revenge, a slippery rise followed by a crashing fall as the wheel of
fortune turns – places the play in the tradition of the Roman tragedian
Seneca. The influence on Shakespeare was probably both direct – Seneca
had been published in English translation in the 1580s – and indirect,
via the Mirror for Magistrates , a highly Senecan collection of
‘complaint’ poems, telling of misfortunes and wickedness, written in the
voices of the victims of history, including both King Richard’s brother
George, Duke of Clarence, and King Edward IV’s mistress, Jane Shore.</p>
<p>The Senecan symmetry is taken to an extreme in the role of Queen
Margaret, the widow of King Henry VI, who had been such a powerful force
throughout the Wars of the Roses plays. In Act 1 scene 3, she formally
curses Rivers, Dorset, Hastings, Buckingham and Richard himself. All her
curses are fulfilled and as each character dies, he realizes that this
is the case. Senecan tragedy traditionally began with a Ghost returning
from the underworld and demanding revenge for his or her murder. In an
elegant variation, Shakespeare withholds the Ghosts for the climax of
the play, bringing them on to taunt King Richard in his tent on the eve
of the battle that will be his downfall.</p>
<p>Whereas nearly everybody in the Henry VI plays appears to be caught
up in a maelstrom of historical events that they are not able to
control, Richard attempts to take command of his own and his country’s
destiny. There is little doubt that the part was written for Richard
Burbage, just as he was becoming Shakespeare’s closest friend in the
theatre world. Richard the Third is the first of the small group of
Shakespearean plays that are not ensemble pieces – which the Henry VI
plays so clearly were – but star vehicles, in which the leading player
has three times as many lines as anybody else. This play was the making
of both the writer and the star. It accounts for their nicknames in a
well-attested theatrical anecdote that has them as rivals in the bed of
a theatre-crazed citizen’s wife: Burbage is ‘Richard the Third’ and
Shakespeare ‘William the Conqueror’.</p>
<p>The trick that they seem to have worked out together was to make the
leading character into the apparent author of his own script. From the
very opening soliloquy, Richard takes the audience into his confidence
and shares with them the role he will adopt and the plot of the drama
that he intends to act out, which might be entitled ‘an unlovely but
clever man plans his ascent to the throne, not letting anybody – even an
innocent child – get in his way’. He is master of the wink and the
aside; he rejoices in playing the role of Iniquity, the Vice in the old
tradition of morality plays. The audience enjoys his performance exactly
because they know it is a performance.</p>
<p>The master actor needs a straight man. For Richard, this role is
played by Buckingham, who assists him as he stage-manages his public
image for his appearance before the Lord Mayor and citizens of London.
In the previous play in the sequence, Henry VI’s prayer-book was a sign
that he did not want to be king; Richard’s is a sign that he is
pretending not to want to be king, thus leading the Londoners to beg him
to take on the office. ‘Will you enforce me to a world of cares?’ he
says, feigning reluctance – and in the next breath he whispers ‘Call
them again’, ensuring that the offer is renewed so that this time it can
be accepted. In all this, he is, as always, the consummate actor.</p>
<p>There are two key turning points for Richard. One is when he
contrives to lose his right-hand man, Buckingham. The comedian begins to
flounder without his stooge. The other is when the lamenting women who
serve as a kind of Greek chorus to the action come together and confront
him in the enormously long fourth scene of the fourth act. Richard’s
bravura seduction of the Lady Anne had revealed his skill with words,
but now his verbal power is matched by the combined forces of the Queens
Margaret and Elizabeth. If one innovation in the writing of Richard the
Third was the conversion of the ensemble chronicle play into a star
vehicle for a single huge theatrical personality, the other was the
feminization of this traditionally masculine form. In Shakespeare’s
earlier history plays, in those of other authors, and indeed in the
tragedies of Marlowe, women are bit-part players. Here, however, the
boy-actors who play Elizabeth, Margaret and Anne are given larger parts
and more richly inflected rhetoric than all of their adult colleagues
save the leading three who play Richard, Buckingham and Clarence.
Symbolically, given that Richard explains his own lust for power as a
consequence of his inadequacy in the arts of love, it is fitting that he
meets his match in the form of women and boys.</p>
<p>It is Richard’s theatrical self-consciousness that ultimately sets
his play above the three parts of Henry VI . In The First Part , Talbot
is a manly hero and Joan an intriguing semi-comic villain; in The Second
Part , there is splendid energy (Queen Margaret running amok) and
variety (Jack Cade and the voice of the discontented commons); in The
Third Part , we witness a scene of high drama when York is taunted with
a paper crown before being stabbed to death. But it is not until Richard
of Gloucester gets into his stride that we meet a figure with the
compelling theatrical presence of a Falstaff or an Iago. At the climax
of his first long soliloquy in Act 3 of 3 Henry VI – a speech that the
theatrical tradition has often imported into Richard the Third – he
announces that he will ‘play the orator’, ‘add colours to the
chameleon’, and ‘change shapes with Proteus for advantages’: each image
is of the art of the actor, with his persuasive tongue and power of
self-transformation.</p>
<p>Richard adds that he will ‘set the murderous Machevil to school’. In
his black farce The Jew of Malta , Christopher Marlowe had brought on a
representation of Machiavelli, the Renaissance archetype of the scheming
politician, to speak the prologue. As soon as the Prologue leaves the
stage, Barabas the Jew is revealed, speaking his opening soliloquy. The
audience thus makes the equation that Barabas is a machiavellian
schemer. In Richard the Third , Shakespeare made a bold advance on this
device. He dispensed with a prologue and began the action with Richard’s
riveting soliloquy, ‘Now is the winter of our discontent.’ Where Marlowe
had cast Barabas in the role of the machiavel by means of a pointed
structural device, Shakespeare’s Richard casts himself. He announces
that since his crookback prevents him from playing the role of a
stage-lover, he will self-consciously adopt that of a stage-villain. For
good measure, he goes on in the second scene to show that he can in fact
play the lover – with such accomplishment that he successfully woos Lady
Anne over the very corpse of her father-in-law when she knows that he
has been responsible for the murder of her first husband. As promised,
he plays the orator to supreme effect. By the third act, he is changing
shapes with Proteus and, as we have seen, appearing between two bishops
in the colour of a holy man. By means of the orator’s art of saying the
opposite of what he means – ‘I cannot nor I will not’ accept the crown –
he wins over the Mayor and citizens of London.</p>
<p>The character of Richard III is Shakespeare’s improvment on the
Marlovian anti-hero. Marlowe’s Tamburlaine, Barabas and Dr Faustus
fashion their identities by assuming roles – scourge of God, Machevil,
conjuror. They do not stop to think that such roles are precisely that:
flimsy theatrical impersonations. If they did stop, the whole Marlovian
house of cards would come tumbling down. But Shakespeare began from a
different place. He was an actor himself. This was the one trump card
that was unavailable to Marlowe. Richard is quintessentially
Shakespearean, supremely charismatic in the theatre, because he knows
that he is a role-player. He revels, and makes the audience revel, in
play-acting. He is the first full embodiment of a Shakespearean
obsession that culminates in Macbeth’s ‘poor player’ and Prospero’s
‘These our actors.’ It is Iago in Othello who says ‘I am not what I am.’
But Richard could have said it too.</p>
<p>Only in his dreams does Richard stop acting. And when that happens,
his identity collapses. Since he has forged his identity through acting,
Richard denies the possibility of an essential being that is anterior to
performance. He cannot sustain a language of being – ‘I am’, ‘I am not’
– because he keeps coming back to particular roles (‘villain’) and
actions (murdering). The moment when an authentic self ought to be
asserted, as in a death-bed repentance, becomes that when the self
collapses. This is an actor-dramatist’s way of looking at the nature of
human being. The ghosts who appear to him in his dream the night before
the last battle make him realize that actions have consequences: murder
will bring him ‘to the bar’ and a verdict of ‘guilty’ will be
pronounced. This final emphasis upon guilt is the pragmatic
Shakespeare’s correction of the blasphemous Marlowe towards religious
and moral orthodoxy. Having been granted his earthly crown, Richard is
defeated by Henry of Richmond, who has spent the night before the battle
of Bosworth Field in pious prayer to the Christian God: ‘O thou, whose
captain I account myself, / Look on my forces with a gracious eye.’ The
fall of the over-reacher is thus yoked to the Tudor myth of that
providential scheme of history which combined the houses of York and
Lancaster and established the dynasty that brought unity, then
Reformation and ambition for imperial glory to the nation.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>AUTHORSHIP: Though closely related to the Henry VI plays, authorship
of which is much disputed, Richard the Third is almost certainly
entirely Shakespeare’s.</p>
<p>PLOT: After years of civil unrest between the royal Houses of York
and Lancaster, the Yorkist Edward IV is undisputed king. His brother,
Richard Duke of Gloucester, plots to seize the throne for himself,
removing anybody in his path. Richard decides he needs a wife and sets
out to woo Lady Anne, widow of Henry VI’s heir. Against all the odds he
wins her and celebrates by having his brother Clarence covertly killed
in the Tower. On hearing of Clarence’s death, Edward IV is taken ill and
dies. In his new role as Lord Protector, Richard has Edward’s heirs
confined in the Tower, supposedly for safe-keeping and to await the
coronation. Edward IV’s widow, Queen Elizabeth, mistrusts Richard and is
proved right when he orders the execution of her brother Rivers and son
(by her first marriage) Grey. The Duke of Buckingham becomes Richard’s
chief adviser and together they mastermind and manipulate Richard’s
accession to the throne. Richard promises Buckingham an earldom for his
help but refuses to grant it when Buckingham will not kill the princes
held in the Tower. Richard finds other killers. Fearing for his safety,
Buckingham flees to join the last Lancastrian heir Henry Tudor, Earl of
Richmond, who is leading an army from France against Richard. Having
willed the death of his wife Anne, Richard plans to marry Edward IV’s
daughter (also Elizabeth, not seen in the play) in order to prevent
Richmond from doing so and thereby strengthening his claim to the
throne; Queen Elizabeth tricks him by pretending that she will assist
him in this. Richmond and his followers arrive in England and the two
armies’ camp close at Bosworth Field. The night before the battle, the
Ghosts of his victims torment Richard in his dreams. The next day
Richard is killed in battle and Richmond claims the crown as Henry VII.
He announces he will marry Elizabeth of York and finally unite the two
warring factions.</p>

<p>DATE: 1592? 1594? Must follow the Henry VI plays, so perhaps written
shortly before the theatres were closed due to plague in June 1592.
Alteration of the chronicle sources to flatter Lord Stanley, Earl of
Derby, has led some scholars to suppose that the play was written for
the acting company of Lord Strange’s Men, active at this time, whose
patron was Stanley’s descendant. Alternatively, Shakespeare might have
been writing for Pembroke’s Men in 1592: the text also includes brief
praise of the Pembroke family name. Some scholars, by contrast, suppose
the play to be Shakespeare’s first work for the Lord Chamberlain’s Men,
the company formed after the post-plague reopening of the theatres in
summer 1594. Support for this view might come from the way in which the
play was clearly written as a showcase for Richard Burbage, the
Chamberlain’s leading man.</p>
<p>SOURCES: The main source for the representation of Richard as a
hunchbacked villain is Sir Thomas More’s History of King Richard III
(c.1513). Since More was writing at the court of King Henry VIII, son of
Henry VII, who defeated Richard at Bosworth Field, he had a vested
interest in portraying Richard as unfavourably as possible. He got much
of his information from Bishop Morton of Ely, a bitter enemy of Richard.
More’s account was incorporated in the major Tudor chronicles;
Shakespeare probably read it via Edward Hall’s Union of the Noble and
Illustre Famelies of Lancastre and York (1548). He may also have
consulted Holinshed and one or more other chronicles. The historical
poem sequence known as The Mirror for Magistrates (1559, expanded 1563)
seems to have shaped Shakespeare’s treatment of the Clarence plot. The
relationship to an anonymous drama The True Tragedie of Richard the
Third (registered for publication June 1594, poorly printed) is unclear:
it seems to have been older play, belonging to the Queen’s Men, that was
perhaps published to cash in on the success of Shakespeare’s
version.</p>
<p>TEXT: Quarto edition, 1597, with title advertising the content of the
play: The Tragedy of King Richard the third. Containing, His treacherous
Plots against his brother Clarence: the pittiefull murther of his
innocent nephewes: his tyrannicall vsurpation: with the whole course of
his detested life, and most deserued death. As it hath beene lately
Acted by the Right honourable the Lord Chamberlaine his seruants .
Reprinted 1598, with Shakespeare’s name on the title page (one of the
first printed plays to be so attributed), and again in 1602, 1605, 1612,
1622, 1629, 1634, indicating the play’s popularity. Each Quarto was
reprinted from the last, with some errors and occasional editorial
correction. The 1623 Folio text derives from an independent manuscript
that differed substantially from the Quarto tradition, though the Sixth
Quarto and to a lesser extent the Third Quarto were consulted in its
preparation. There has been much scholarly debate over the sources and
relationship of the two texts: their relationship and relative authority
has been justifiably described as the most difficult textual problem in
all Shakespeare. It appears that the Folio, though printed much later,
reflects an earlier version of the play. The Folio text is about 200
lines longer than the Quarto, a difference more probably due to Quarto
cutting and streamlining than Folio expansion. The Quarto has just under
40 lines that are not in Folio. There are hundreds of variants of
wording. The Folio text is generally more coherent; some of the
difficulties of the Quarto have been attributed to ‘memorial
reconstruction’ by actors, but current scholarship questions this view.
Though Folio has many deficiencies, some imported from the Quarto
tradition and others introduced by the compositors, it requires less
editorial intervention to render it comprehensible and theatrically
workable. It has been the copy text for most, though not all, scholarly
editions, as it is for ours, in accordance with our Folio-based
policy.</p>
