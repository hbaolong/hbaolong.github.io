<h4 id="scene-1-914-running-scene-9">Scene 1 914 / running scene 9</h4>
<p>Enter Richard [of Gloucester ], Clarence, Somerset and Montague</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you</p>
<p>Of this new marriage with the lady Grey?</p>
<p>Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?</p>
<p>CLARENCE Alas, you know, ’tis far from hence to France.</p>
<p>How could he stay 915 till Warwick made return?</p>
<p>SOMERSET My lords, forbear this talk: here comes the king.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER And his well-chosen bride.</p>
<p>CLARENCE I mind 916 to tell him plainly what I think.</p>
<p>Flourish. Enter King Edward, Lady Grey [now Queen Elizabeth ],
Pembroke, Stafford, Hastings: four stand on one side and four on the
other</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,</p>
<p>That you stand pensive, as half malcontent 917 ?</p>
<p>CLARENCE As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,</p>
<p>Which 918 are so weak of courage and in judgement</p>
<p>That they’ll take no offence at our abuse 919 .</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Suppose they take offence without a cause:</p>
<p>They are but Lewis and Warwick. I am Edward,</p>
<p>Your king and Warwick’s, and must have my will 920 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER And shall have your will, because our king.</p>
<p>Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Not I, no:</p>
<p>God forbid that I should wish them severed</p>
<p>Whom God hath joined together. Ay, and ’twere pity</p>
<p>To sunder them that yoke 921 so well together.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Setting your scorns and your mislike 922 aside,</p>
<p>Tell me some reason why the lady Grey</p>
<p>Should not become my wife and England’s queen.—</p>
<p>And you too, Somerset and Montague,</p>
<p>Speak freely what you think.</p>
<p>CLARENCE Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis</p>
<p>Becomes your enemy, for mocking him</p>
<p>About the marriage of the lady Bona.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge 923 ,</p>
<p>Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased</p>
<p>By such invention 924 as I can devise?</p>
<p>MONTAGUE Yet, to have joined with France in such alliance</p>
<p>Would more have strengthened this our commonwealth</p>
<p>Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.</p>
<p>HASTINGS Why, knows not Montague that of itself</p>
<p>England is safe, if true 925 within itself?</p>
<p>MONTAGUE But the safer when ’tis backed with France.</p>
<p>HASTINGS ’Tis better using France than trusting France.</p>
<p>Let us be backed with God and with the seas</p>
<p>Which he hath given for fence 926 impregnable,</p>
<p>And with their helps only 927 defend ourselves.</p>
<p>In them, and in ourselves, our safety lies.</p>
<p>CLARENCE For this one speech, Lord Hastings well deserves</p>
<p>To have the heir of the lord Hungerford 928 .</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Ay, what of that? It was my will and grant,</p>
<p>And for this once my will shall stand for law.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,</p>
<p>To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales</p>
<p>Unto the brother of your loving bride 929 ;</p>
<p>She better would have fitted me or Clarence,</p>
<p>But in your bride you bury 930 brotherhood.</p>
<p>CLARENCE Or else you would not have bestowed the heir</p>
<p>Of the lord Bonville on your new wife’s son 931 ,</p>
<p>And leave your brothers to go speed 932 elsewhere.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Alas, poor Clarence, is it for a wife</p>
<p>That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.</p>
<p>CLARENCE In choosing for yourself, you showed your judgement,</p>
<p>Which being shallow, you shall give me leave</p>
<p>To play the broker 933 in mine own behalf.</p>
<p>And to that end, I shortly mind 934 to leave you.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Leave me, or tarry 935 , Edward will be king,</p>
<p>And not be tied unto his brother’s will.</p>
<p>LADY GREY My lords, before it pleased his majesty</p>
<p>To raise my state to title of a queen,</p>
<p>Do me but right, and you must all confess</p>
<p>That I was not ignoble of descent,</p>
<p>And meaner 936 than myself have had like fortune.</p>
<p>But as this title honours me and mine,</p>
<p>So your dislikes 937 , to whom I would 938 be pleasing,</p>
<p>Doth cloud my joys with danger 939 and with sorrow.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns 940 .</p>
<p>What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,</p>
<p>So long as Edward is thy constant friend 941 ,</p>
<p>And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?</p>
<p>Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,</p>
<p>Unless they seek for hatred at my hands,</p>
<p>Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,</p>
<p>And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Enter a Post</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Now, messenger, what letters or what news from
France?</p>
<p>POST My sovereign liege, no letters, and few words,</p>
<p>But such as I, without your special pardon,</p>
<p>Dare not relate.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Go to 942 , we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,</p>
<p>Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess 943 them.</p>
<p>What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?</p>
<p>POST At my depart, these were his very words:</p>
<p>’Go tell false Edward, thy supposèd king,</p>
<p>That Lewis of France is sending over masquers</p>
<p>To revel it with him and his new bride.’</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Is Lewis so brave 944 ? Belike he thinks me Henry.</p>
<p>But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?</p>
<p>POST These were her words, uttered with mild disdain:</p>
<p>’Tell him, in hope he’ll prove a widower shortly,</p>
<p>I’ll wear the willow garland for his sake.’</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV I blame not her; she could say little less.</p>
<p>She had the wrong.— But what said Henry’s queen?</p>
<p>For I have heard that she was there in place 945 .</p>
<p>POST ‘Tell him’, quoth she, ’my mourning weeds are done 946 ,</p>
<p>And I am ready to put armour on.’</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Belike she minds to play the Amazon 947 .</p>
<p>But what said Warwick to these injuries 948 ?</p>
<p>POST He, more incensed against your majesty</p>
<p>Than all the rest, discharged 949 me with these words:</p>
<p>’Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,</p>
<p>And therefore I’ll uncrown him ere’t be long.’</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Ha? Durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?</p>
<p>Well, I will arm me, being thus forewarned.</p>
<p>They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.—</p>
<p>But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?</p>
<p>POST Ay, gracious sovereign, they are so linked in friendship</p>
<p>That young Prince Edward marries Warwick’s daughter.</p>
<p>CLARENCE Belike 950 the elder; Clarence will have the younger.—</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast 951 ,</p>
<p>For I will hence to Warwick’s other daughter,</p>
<p>That, though I want 952 a kingdom, yet in marriage</p>
<p>I may not prove inferior to yourself.</p>
<p>You that love me and Warwick, follow me.</p>
<p>Exit Clarence, and Somerset follows</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Not I.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>My thoughts aim at a further matter:</p>
<p>I stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!</p>
<p>Yet am I armed against the worst can happen,</p>
<p>And haste is needful 953 in this desp’rate case.—</p>
<p>Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf</p>
<p>Go levy men, and make prepare 954 for war;</p>
<p>They are already, or quickly will be landed.</p>
<p>Myself in person will straight 955 follow you.</p>
<p>Exeunt Pembroke and Stafford</p>
<p>But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,</p>
<p>Resolve my doubt. You twain 956 , of all the rest,</p>
<p>Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:</p>
<p>Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?</p>
<p>If it be so, then both depart to him.</p>
<p>I rather wish you foes than hollow 957 friends.</p>
<p>But if you mind to hold your true obedience,</p>
<p>Give me assurance with some friendly vow,</p>
<p>That I may never have you in suspect 958 .</p>
<p>MONTAGUE So God help Montague as he proves true.</p>
<p>HASTINGS And Hastings as he favours Edward’s cause.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand 959 you.</p>
<p>KING EDWARD IV Why, so. Then am I sure of victory.</p>
<p>Now therefore let us hence, and lose no hour</p>
<p>Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power 960 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
