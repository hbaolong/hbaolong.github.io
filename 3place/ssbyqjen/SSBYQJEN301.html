12</h4>
<p>Enter Leontes, Cleomenes, Dion, Paulina [and ] Servants</p>
<p>CLEOMENES Sir, you have done enough, and have performed</p>
<p>A saint-like sorrow 1380 . No fault could you make,</p>
<p>Which you have not redeemed; indeed, paid down</p>
<p>More penitence than done trespass 1381 . At the last,</p>
<p>Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil.</p>
<p>With them forgive yourself.</p>
<p>LEONTES Whilst I remember</p>
<p>Her and her virtues, I cannot forget</p>
<p>My blemishes in them 1382 , and so still think of</p>
<p>The wrong I did myself, which was so much</p>
<p>That heirless it hath made my kingdom and</p>
<p>Destroyed the sweet’st companion that e’er man</p>
<p>Bred his hopes out of. True?</p>
<p>PAULINA Too true, my lord.</p>
<p>If, one by one, you wedded all the world,</p>
<p>Or from the all that are 1383 took something good</p>
<p>To make a perfect woman, she you killed</p>
<p>Would be unparalleled.</p>
<p>LEONTES I think so. Killed?</p>
<p>She I killed? I did so: but thou strik’st me</p>
<p>Sorely, to say I did. It is as bitter</p>
<p>Upon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now 1384 ,</p>
<p>Say so but seldom.</p>
<p>CLEOMENES Not at all, good lady.</p>
<p>You might have spoken a thousand things that would</p>
<p>Have done the time more benefit 1385 and graced</p>
<p>Your kindness better.</p>
<p>PAULINA You are one of those</p>
<p>Would have him wed again.</p>
<p>DION If you would not so,</p>
<p>You pity not the state, nor the remembrance</p>
<p>Of his most sovereign name 1386 , consider little</p>
<p>What dangers by his highness’ fail of issue 1387</p>
<p>May drop upon his kingdom and devour</p>
<p>Incertain lookers on 1388 . What were more holy</p>
<p>Than to rejoice the former queen is well 1389 ?</p>
<p>What holier than, for royalty’s repair,</p>
<p>For present comfort and for future good,</p>
<p>To bless the bed of majesty again</p>
<p>With a sweet fellow to’t?</p>
<p>PAULINA There is none worthy,</p>
<p>Respecting 1390 her that’s gone. Besides, the gods</p>
<p>Will have fulfilled their secret purposes.</p>
<p>For has not the divine Apollo said?</p>
<p>Is’t not the tenor 1391 of his oracle,</p>
<p>That King Leontes shall not have an heir</p>
<p>Till his lost child be found? Which that it shall</p>
<p>Is all as monstrous 1392 to our human reason</p>
<p>As my Antigonus to break his grave</p>
<p>And come again to me, who, on my life, 1393</p>
<p>Did perish with the infant. ’Tis your counsel 1394</p>
<p>My lord should to the heavens be contrary,</p>
<p>Oppose against their wills.— Care not for issue.</p>
<p>To Leontes</p>
<p>The crown will find an heir. Great Alexander</p>
<p>Left his to th’worthiest 1395 , so his successor</p>
<p>Was like to be the best.</p>
<p>LEONTES Good Paulina,</p>
<p>Who hast the memory of Hermione,</p>
<p>I know, in honour — O, that ever I</p>
<p>Had squared me 1396 to thy counsel! Then, even now,</p>
<p>I might have looked upon my queen’s full 1397 eyes,</p>
<p>Have taken treasure from her lips—</p>
<p>PAULINA And left them</p>
<p>More rich for what they yielded.</p>
<p>LEONTES Thou speak’st truth.</p>
<p>No more such wives: therefore, no wife. One worse,</p>
<p>And better used 1398 , would make her 1399 sainted spirit</p>
<p>Again possess her corpse, and 1400 on this stage —</p>
<p>Where we offenders now 1401 — appear soul-vexed 1402 ,</p>
<p>And begin, ‘Why 1403 to me?’</p>
<p>PAULINA Had she such power,</p>
<p>She had 1404 just such cause.</p>
<p>LEONTES She had, and would incense me</p>
<p>To murder her I married.</p>
<p>PAULINA I should so 1405 .</p>
<p>Were I the ghost that walked, I’d bid you mark 1406</p>
<p>Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in’t</p>
<p>You chose her. Then I’d shriek, that even your ears</p>
<p>Should rift 1407 to hear me and the words that followed</p>
<p>Should be ‘Remember mine 1408 .’</p>
<p>LEONTES Stars, stars,</p>
<p>And all eyes else 1409 dead coals! Fear thou no wife;</p>
<p>I’ll have no wife, Paulina.</p>
<p>PAULINA Will you swear</p>
<p>Never to marry but by my free leave 1410 ?</p>
<p>LEONTES Never, Paulina, so be blest my spirit!</p>
<p>PAULINA Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.</p>
<p>CLEOMENES You tempt 1411 him over-much.</p>
<p>PAULINA Unless another,</p>
<p>As like Hermione as is her picture,</p>
<p>Affront 1412 his eye.</p>
<p>CLEOMENES Good madam—</p>
<p>PAULINA I have done.</p>
<p>Yet, if my lord will marry — if you will, sir,</p>
<p>No remedy, but you will — give me the office 1413</p>
<p>To choose you a queen. She shall not be so young</p>
<p>As was your former, but she shall be such</p>
<p>As, walked your first queen’s ghost 1414 , it should take joy</p>
<p>To see her in your arms.</p>
<p>LEONTES My true Paulina,</p>
<p>We shall not marry till thou bid’st us.</p>
<p>PAULINA That</p>
<p>Shall be when your first queen’s again in breath.</p>
<p>Never till then.</p>
<p>Enter a Servant 1415</p>
<p>SERVANT One that gives out himself 1416 Prince Florizel,</p>
<p>Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she</p>
<p>The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access</p>
<p>To your high presence.</p>
<p>LEONTES What 1417 with him? He comes not</p>
<p>Like to his father’s greatness. His approach,</p>
<p>So out of circumstance 1418 and sudden, tells us</p>
<p>’Tis not a visitation framed 1419 , but forced</p>
<p>By need and accident 1420 . What train 1421 ?</p>
<p>SERVANT But few,</p>
<p>And those but mean 1422 .</p>
<p>LEONTES His princess, say you, with him?</p>
<p>SERVANT Ay, the most peerless piece of earth 1423 , I think,</p>
<p>That e’er the sun shone bright on.</p>
<p>PAULINA O, Hermione,</p>
<p>As every present time doth boast itself</p>
<p>Above a better gone, so must thy grave</p>
<p>Give way to what’s seen now 1424 ! Sir, you yourself</p>
<p>To Servant</p>
<p>Have said and writ so, but your writing now</p>
<p>Is colder than that theme 1425 : ’She had not been,</p>
<p>Nor was not to be equalled.’ Thus your verse</p>
<p>Flowed with her beauty once; ’tis shrewdly ebbed 1426 ,</p>
<p>To say you have seen a better.</p>
<p>SERVANT Pardon, madam.</p>
<p>The one 1427 I have almost forgot — your pardon —</p>
<p>The other, when she has obtained your eye,</p>
<p>Will have your tongue 1428 too. This is a creature,</p>
<p>Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal</p>
<p>Of all professors else 1429 , make proselytes 1430</p>
<p>Of who 1431 she but bid follow.</p>
<p>PAULINA How? Not women?</p>
<p>SERVANT Women will love her that she is a woman</p>
<p>More worth than any man: men that she is</p>
<p>The rarest of all women.</p>
<p>LEONTES Go, Cleomenes.</p>
<p>Yourself, assisted with your honoured friends,</p>
<p>Bring them to our embracement.— Still, ’tis strange</p>
<p>To Paulina</p>
<p>He thus should steal upon us.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Cleomenes and others ]</p>
<p>PAULINA Had our prince 1432 ,</p>
<p>Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had paired</p>
<p>Well with this lord, there was not full a 1433 month</p>
<p>Between their births.</p>
<p>LEONTES Prithee no more; cease. Thou know’st</p>
<p>He dies to me again when talked of. Sure,</p>
<p>When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches</p>
<p>Will bring me to consider that which may</p>
<p>Unfurnish 1434 me of reason. They are come.</p>
<p>Enter Cleomenes and others, [with ] Florizel and Perdita</p>
<p>Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince,</p>
<p>To Florizel</p>
<p>For she did print your royal father off 1435 ,</p>
<p>Conceiving you. Were I but twenty-one,</p>
<p>Your father’s image is so hit 1436 in you,</p>
<p>His very air, that I should call you brother,</p>
<p>As I did him, and speak of something wildly</p>
<p>By us performed before. Most dearly welcome!</p>
<p>And your fair princess — goddess! — O, alas!</p>
<p>I lost a couple, that ’twixt heaven and earth</p>
<p>Might thus have stood begetting 1437 wonder as</p>
<p>You, gracious couple, do. And then I lost —</p>
<p>All mine own folly — the society 1438 ,</p>
<p>Amity 1439 too, of your brave father, whom,</p>
<p>Though bearing misery, I desire my life</p>
<p>Once more to look on him 1440 .</p>
<p>FLORIZEL By his command</p>
<p>Have I here touched 1441 Sicilia and from him</p>
<p>Give you all greetings that a king, at 1442 friend,</p>
<p>Can send his brother, and but 1443 infirmity,</p>
<p>Which waits upon worn times 1444 hath something seized</p>
<p>His wished ability 1445 , he had himself</p>
<p>The lands and waters ’twixt your throne and his</p>
<p>Measured 1446 to look upon you, whom he loves —</p>
<p>He bade me say so — more than all the sceptres</p>
<p>And those that bear them living 1447 .</p>
<p>LEONTES O, my brother —</p>
<p>Good gentleman! — the wrongs I have done thee stir</p>
<p>Afresh within me, and these thy offices 1448 ,</p>
<p>So rarely 1449 kind, are as interpreters</p>
<p>Of my behind-hand slackness 1450 . Welcome hither,</p>
<p>As is the spring to th’earth. And hath he too</p>
<p>Exposed this paragon 1451 to th’fearful usage 1452 ,</p>
<p>At least ungentle 1453 , of the dreadful Neptune 1454 ,</p>
<p>To greet a man not worth her pains 1455 , much less</p>
<p>Th’adventure of her person 1456 ?</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Good my lord,</p>
<p>She came from Libya.</p>
<p>LEONTES Where the warlike Smalus 1457 ,</p>
<p>That noble honoured lord, is feared and loved?</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Most royal sir, from thence, from him whose daughter</p>
<p>His tears proclaimed 1458 his, parting with her: thence,</p>
<p>A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have crossed,</p>
<p>To execute 1459 the charge 1460 my father gave me</p>
<p>For visiting your highness. My best train</p>
<p>I have from your Sicilian shores dismissed,</p>
<p>Who for Bohemia bend 1461 , to signify</p>
<p>Not only my success in Libya, sir,</p>
<p>But my arrival and my wife’s in safety</p>
<p>Here where we are.</p>
<p>LEONTES The blessèd gods</p>
<p>Purge all infection from our air whilst you</p>
<p>Do climate 1462 here! You have a holy father,</p>
<p>A graceful 1463 gentleman, against whose person,</p>
<p>So sacred as it is, I have done sin,</p>
<p>For which the heavens, taking angry note,</p>
<p>Have left me issueless 1464 . And your father’s blest,</p>
<p>As he from heaven merits it, with you,</p>
<p>Worthy his 1465 goodness. What might I have been,</p>
<p>Might I a son and daughter now have looked on,</p>
<p>Such goodly things as you.</p>
<p>Enter a Lord</p>
<p>LORD Most noble sir,</p>
<p>That which I shall report will bear no credit 1466 ,</p>
<p>Were not the proof so nigh 1467 . Please you, great sir,</p>
<p>Bohemia greets you from himself by me.</p>
<p>Desires you to attach 1468 his son, who has —</p>
<p>His dignity and duty 1469 both cast off —</p>
<p>Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with</p>
<p>A shepherd’s daughter.</p>
<p>LEONTES Where’s Bohemia? Speak.</p>
<p>LORD Here in your city. I now came from him.</p>
<p>I speak amazedly 1470 , and it becomes</p>
<p>My marvel 1471 and my message. To your court</p>
<p>Whiles he was hast’ning, in the chase, it seems,</p>
<p>Of this fair couple, meets he on the way</p>
<p>The father of this seeming 1472 lady and</p>
<p>Her brother, having both their country quitted</p>
<p>With this young prince.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Camillo has betrayed me,</p>
<p>Whose honour and whose honesty till now</p>
<p>Endured all weathers.</p>
<p>LORD Lay’t so to his charge 1473 :</p>
<p>He’s with the king your father.</p>
<p>LEONTES Who? Camillo?</p>
<p>LORD Camillo, sir. I spake with him, who now</p>
<p>Has these poor men in question 1474 . Never saw I</p>
<p>Wretches so quake. They kneel, they kiss the earth,</p>
<p>Forswear themselves 1475 as often as they speak.</p>
<p>Bohemia stops 1476 his ears, and threatens them</p>
<p>With divers 1477 deaths in death.</p>
<p>PERDITA O, my poor father!</p>
<p>The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have</p>
<p>Our contract 1478 celebrated.</p>
<p>LEONTES You are married?</p>
<p>FLORIZEL We are not, sir, nor are we like to be.</p>
<p>The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first 1479 :</p>
<p>The odds for high and low’s alike 1480 .</p>
<p>LEONTES My lord,</p>
<p>Is this the daughter of a king?</p>
<p>FLORIZEL She is,</p>
<p>When once she is my wife.</p>
<p>LEONTES That ‘once’ I see by your good father’s speed</p>
<p>Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,</p>
<p>Most sorry, you have broken from his liking</p>
<p>Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry</p>
<p>Your choice is not so rich in worth 1481 as beauty,</p>
<p>That you might well enjoy her.</p>
<p>FLORIZEL Dear, look 1482 up.</p>
<p>To Perdita</p>
<p>Though Fortune, visible an enemy,</p>
<p>Should chase us with my father, power no jot</p>
<p>Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,</p>
<p>Remember since you owed no more to time</p>
<p>Than I do now 1483 . With thought of such affections,</p>
<p>Step forth mine advocate 1484 . At your request</p>
<p>My father will grant precious things as trifle 1485 s.</p>
<p>LEONTES Would he do so, I’d beg your precious mistress,</p>
<p>Which he counts but a trifle.</p>
<p>PAULINA Sir, my liege,</p>
<p>Your eye hath too much youth in’t. Not a month</p>
<p>’Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes</p>
<p>Than what you look on now.</p>
<p>LEONTES I thought of her,</p>
<p>Even in these looks I made.— But your petition 1486</p>
<p>To Florizel</p>
<p>Is yet unanswered. I will to your father.</p>
<p>Your honour not o’erthrown by your desires 1487 ,</p>
<p>I am friend to them and you, upon which errand</p>
<p>I now go toward him: therefore follow me</p>
<p>And mark what way I make 1488 . Come, good my lord.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
