10</h4>
<p>Enter Banquo</p>
<p>BANQUO Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all</p>
<p>As the weyard women promised, and I fear</p>
<p>Thou played’st most foully 608 for’t. Yet it was said</p>
<p>It should not stand in thy posterity 609 ,</p>
<p>But that myself should be the root and father</p>
<p>Of many kings. If there come truth from them —</p>
<p>As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine 610 —</p>
<p>Why, by the verities 611 on thee made good 612 ,</p>
<p>May they not be my oracles as well,</p>
<p>And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.</p>
<p>Sennet sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady [Macbeth as Queen ],
Lennox, Ross, Lords and Attendants</p>
<p>MACBETH Here’s our chief guest.</p>
<p>LADY MACBETH If he had been forgotten,</p>
<p>It had been as a gap in our great feast</p>
<p>And all-thing unbecoming 613 .</p>
<p>MACBETH Tonight we hold a solemn 614 supper, sir,</p>
<p>To Banquo</p>
<p>And I’ll request your presence.</p>
<p>BANQUO Let your highness</p>
<p>Command upon 615 me, to the which my duties</p>
<p>Are with a most indissoluble tie</p>
<p>Forever knit 616 .</p>
<p>MACBETH Ride you this afternoon?</p>
<p>BANQUO Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p>MACBETH We should have else 617 desired your good advice —</p>
<p>Which still 618 hath been both grave and prosperous —</p>
<p>In this day’s council: but we’ll take tomorrow.</p>
<p>Is’t 619 620 far you ride?</p>
<p>BANQUO As far, my lord, as will fill up the time</p>
<p>’Twixt this 621 and supper: go not my horse the better 622 ,</p>
<p>I must become a borrower of the night</p>
<p>For a dark hour or twain 623 .</p>
<p>MACBETH Fail not our feast.</p>
<p>BANQUO My lord, I will not.</p>
<p>MACBETH We hear our bloody cousins 624 are bestowed 625</p>
<p>In England and in Ireland, not confessing</p>
<p>Their cruel parricide 626 , filling their hearers</p>
<p>With strange invention 627 : but of that tomorrow,</p>
<p>When therewithal 628 we shall have cause of state</p>
<p>Craving us jointly 629 . Hie you to horse. Adieu,</p>
<p>Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?</p>
<p>BANQUO Ay, my good lord. Our time does call upon’s.</p>
<p>MACBETH I wish your horses swift and sure of foot,</p>
<p>And so I do commend 630 you to their backs. Farewell.</p>
<p>Exit Banquo</p>
<p>Let every man be master of his time</p>
<p>Till seven at night. To make society</p>
<p>The sweeter welcome 631 , we will keep ourself</p>
<p>Till supper-time alone: while 632 then, God be with you!</p>
<p>Exeunt Lords. [Macbeth and a Servant remain ]</p>
<p>Sirrah 633 , a word with you. Attend those men</p>
<p>Our pleasure? 634</p>
<p>SERVANT They are, my lord, without 635 the palace gate.</p>
<p>MACBETH Bring them before us.</p>
<p>Exit Servant</p>
<p>To be thus 636 is nothing, but to be safely thus:</p>
<p>Our fears in Banquo stick 637 deep,</p>
<p>And in his royalty of nature reigns that</p>
<p>Which would be feared. ’Tis much he dares,</p>
<p>And to 638 that dauntless temper 639 of his mind,</p>
<p>He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour</p>
<p>To act in safety. There is none but he</p>
<p>Whose being 640 I do fear: and under him</p>
<p>My genius 641 is rebuked 642 , as it is said</p>
<p>Mark Antony’s was by Caesar 643 . He chid 644 the sisters</p>
<p>When first they put the name of king upon me,</p>
<p>And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like</p>
<p>They hailed him father to a line of kings:</p>
<p>Upon my head they placed a fruitless 645 crown,</p>
<p>And put a barren 646 sceptre 647 in my grip,</p>
<p>Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal 648 hand,</p>
<p>No son of mine succeeding. If’t be so,</p>
<p>For Banquo’s issue 649 have I filed 650 my mind:</p>
<p>For them the gracious 651 Duncan have I murdered:</p>
<p>Put rancours 652 in the vessel 653 of my peace</p>
<p>Only for them, and mine eternal jewel 654</p>
<p>Given to the common enemy of man 655</p>
<p>To make them kings: the seeds of Banquo kings.</p>
<p>Rather than so, come fate into the list 656 ,</p>
<p>And champion me 657 to th’utterance 658 !— Who’s there?</p>
<p>Enter Servant and two Murderers</p>
<p>Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.—</p>
<p>To Servant</p>
<p>Exit Servant</p>
<p>Was it not yesterday we spoke together?</p>
<p>MURDERERS It was, so please your highness.</p>
<p>MACBETH Well then, now have you considered of my speeches? Know that
it was he 659 in the times past which held you so under fortune 660 ,
which you thought had been our innocent self: this I made good 661 to
you in our last conference 662 , passed in probation 663 with you how
you were borne in hand 664 , how crossed 665 , the instruments 666 , who
wrought 667 with them, and all things else that might to half a soul and
to a notion 668 crazed say ‘Thus did Banquo.’</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER You made it known to us.</p>
<p>MACBETH I did so, and went further, which is now our point of second
meeting. Do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that
you can let this go? Are you so gospelled 669 to pray for this good man
and for his issue, whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave and
beggared yours 670 for ever 671 ?</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER We are men, my liege.</p>
<p>MACBETH Ay, in the catalogue 672 ye go for 673 men,</p>
<p>As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs 674 ,</p>
<p>Shoughs 675 , water-rugs 676 and demi-wolves 677 are clept 678</p>
<p>All by the name of dogs: the valued file 679</p>
<p>Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle 680 ,</p>
<p>The housekeeper 681 , the hunter, every one</p>
<p>According to the gift which bounteous 682 nature</p>
<p>Hath in him closed 683 , whereby he does receive</p>
<p>Particular addition from the bill</p>
<p>That writes them all alike 684 : and so of men.</p>
<p>Now, if you have a station 685 in the file 686 ,</p>
<p>Not i’th’worst rank 687 of manhood, say’t,</p>
<p>And I will put that business in your bosoms</p>
<p>Whose execution 688 takes your enemy off,</p>
<p>Grapples 689 you to the heart and love of us,</p>
<p>Who wear our health but sickly in his life 690 ,</p>
<p>Which in his death were perfect 691 .</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER I am one, my liege,</p>
<p>Whom the vile blows and buffets 692 of the world</p>
<p>Hath so incensed that I am reckless what</p>
<p>I do to spite the world.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER And I another,</p>
<p>So weary with disasters, tugged with 693 fortune,</p>
<p>That I would set 694 my life on any chance</p>
<p>To mend 695 it or be rid on’t 696 .</p>
<p>MACBETH Both of you know Banquo was your enemy.</p>
<p>MURDERERS True, my lord.</p>
<p>MACBETH So is he mine, and in such bloody distance 697</p>
<p>That every minute of his being thrusts 698</p>
<p>Against my near’st of life 699 : and though I could</p>
<p>With barefaced power sweep him from my sight</p>
<p>And bid my will avouch it 700 , yet I must not,</p>
<p>For 701 certain friends that are both his and mine,</p>
<p>Whose loves I may not drop, but wail 702 his fall</p>
<p>Who I myself struck down. And thence it is</p>
<p>That I to your assistance do make love 703 ,</p>
<p>Masking the business from the common eye</p>
<p>For sundry 704 weighty reasons.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER We shall, my lord,</p>
<p>Perform what you command us.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Though our lives— 705</p>
<p>MACBETH Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most</p>
<p>I will advise 706 you where to plant yourselves,</p>
<p>Acquaint you with the perfect spy o’th’time 707 ,</p>
<p>The moment on’t, for’t must be done tonight,</p>
<p>And something 708 from the palace, always thought</p>
<p>That I require a clearness 709 . And with him —</p>
<p>To leave no rubs nor botches 710 in the work —</p>
<p>Fleance his son, that keeps him company,</p>
<p>Whose absence is no less material 711 to me</p>
<p>Than is his father’s, must embrace the fate</p>
<p>Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart 712 :</p>
<p>I’ll come to you anon.</p>
<p>MURDERERS We are resolved, my lord.</p>
<p>MACBETH I’ll call upon you straight 713 : abide 714 within.—</p>
<p>[Murderers may exit ]</p>
<p>It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight,</p>
<p>If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
