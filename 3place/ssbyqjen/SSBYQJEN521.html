<p>Enter Bastard [Edmund ]</p>
<p>With a letter</p>
<p>EDMUND Thou, nature, art my goddess: to thy law</p>
<p>My services are bound. Wherefore 199 should I</p>
<p>Stand in 200 the plague of custom and permit</p>
<p>The curiosity 201 of nations 202 to deprive me</p>
<p>For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines 203</p>
<p>Lag of 204 a brother? Why bastard? Wherefore base 205 ?</p>
<p>When my dimensions 206 are as well compact 207 ,</p>
<p>My mind as generous 208 , and my shape as true 209 ,</p>
<p>As honest madam’s issue 210 ? Why brand they us</p>
<p>With base? With baseness? Bastardy? Base, base?</p>
<p>Who 211 in the lusty stealth of nature take 212</p>
<p>More composition and fierce quality 213</p>
<p>Than doth within a dull, stale, tirèd bed,</p>
<p>Go to th’creating a whole tribe of fops 214</p>
<p>Got 215 ’tween a sleep and wake? Well then,</p>
<p>Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:</p>
<p>Our father’s love is to the bastard Edmund</p>
<p>As 216 to th’legitimate — fine word, ‘legitimate’ —</p>
<p>Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed 217</p>
<p>And my invention 218 thrive, Edmund the base</p>
<p>Shall to th’legitimate 219 . I grow, I prosper:</p>
<p>Now, gods, stand up for bastards!</p>
<p>Enter Gloucester</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Kent banished thus? And France in choler 220 parted 221
?</p>
<p>And the king gone tonight? Prescribed 222 his power,</p>
<p>Confined to exhibition 223 ? All this done</p>
<p>Upon the gad 224 ? Edmund, how now? What news?</p>
<p>EDMUND So please your lordship, none.</p>
<p>Hides the letter</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Why so earnestly seek you to put up 225 that letter?</p>
<p>EDMUND I know no news, my lord.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER What paper were you reading?</p>
<p>EDMUND Nothing, my lord.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch 226 of it
into your pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide
itself. Let’s see: come, if it be nothing I shall not need
spectacles.</p>
<p>EDMUND I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter from my brother
that I have not all o’er-read; and for 227 so much as I have perused, I
find it not fit for your o’erlooking 228 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Give me the letter, sir.</p>
<p>EDMUND I shall offend either to detain or give it: the contents, as
in part I understand them, are to blame.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Let’s see, let’s see.</p>
<p>Edmund gives the letter</p>
<p>EDMUND I hope for my brother’s justification he wrote this but as an
essay or taste 229 of my virtue.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Reads ‘This policy and reverence of age 230 makes the
world bitter to the best of our times 231 , keeps our fortunes 232 from
us till our oldness cannot relish 233 them. I begin to find an idle 234
and fond 235 bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who sways 236 ,
not as it hath power, but as it is suffered 237 . Come to me, that of
this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I waked him, you
should enjoy half his revenue for ever and live the beloved of your
brother, Edgar.’</p>
<p>Hum! Conspiracy! ‘Sleep till I wake him, you should enjoy half his
revenue.’ My son Edgar? Had he a hand to write this? A heart and brain
to breed it in? When came you to this? Who brought it?</p>
<p>EDMUND It was not brought me, my lord; there’s the cunning of it: I
found it thrown in at the casement 238 of my closet 239 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER You know the character 240 to be your brother’s?</p>
<p>EDMUND If the matter 241 were good, my lord, I durst swear it were
his, but in respect of that 242 I would fain 243 think it were not.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER It is his.</p>
<p>EDMUND It is his hand, my lord, but I hope his heart is not in the
contents.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Has he never before sounded you in this business?</p>
<p>EDMUND Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit
that, sons at perfect age 244 and fathers declined 245 , the father
should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter!
Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! Worse than
brutish! Go, sirrah 246 , seek him: I’ll apprehend 247 him. Abominable
248 villain, where is he?</p>
<p>EDMUND I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend
your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better
testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course 249 , where 250
, if you violently proceed 251 against him, mistaking his purpose, it
would make a great gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the heart
of his obedience. I dare pawn down 252 my life for him, that he hath
writ this to feel 253 my affection to your honour, and to no other
pretence 254 of danger.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Think you so?</p>
<p>EDMUND If your honour judge it meet 255 , I will place you where you
shall hear us confer of this, and by an auricular assurance 256 have
your satisfaction 257 , and that without any further delay than this
very evening.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER He cannot be such a monster. Edmund, seek him out: wind me
into him 258 , I pray you: frame 259 the business after your own wisdom.
I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution 260 .</p>
<p>EDMUND I will seek him, sir, presently 261 : convey 262 the business
as I shall find means and acquaint you withal 263 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER These late 264 eclipses in the sun and moon portend no
good to us: though the wisdom of nature 265 can reason it thus and thus,
yet nature finds itself scourged 266 by the sequent effects 267 : love
cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in
countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked ’twixt son
and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction: there’s son
against father. The king falls from bias of nature 268 : there’s father
against child. We have seen the best of our time: machinations,
hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to
our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund: it shall lose thee nothing
269 . Do it carefully.— And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished!
His offence, honesty! ’Tis strange.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>EDMUND This is the excellent foppery 270 of the world, that when we
are sick in fortune — often the surfeits 271 of our own behaviour — we
make guilty of our disasters 272 the sun, the moon and stars, as if we
were villains on 273 necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves,
thieves and treachers 274 by spherical predominance 275 , drunkards,
liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence,
and all that we are evil in, by a divine 276 thrusting on: an admirable
evasion 277 of whoremaster 278 man, to lay his goatish 279 disposition
on the charge 280 of a star! My father compounded 281 with my mother
under the dragon’s tail 282 and my nativity was under Ursa Major 283 ,
so that it follows I am rough 284 and lecherous. I should have been that
I am had the maidenliest 285 star in the firmament 286 twinkled on my
bastardizing 287 .</p>
<p>Enter Edgar</p>
<p>Pat 288 he comes like the catastrophe 289 of the old comedy 290 : my
cue 291 is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o’Bedlam 292 .—
O, these eclipses do portend these divisions 293 ! Fa, sol, la, mi 294
.</p>
<p>EDGAR How now, brother Edmund, what serious contemplation are you
in?</p>
<p>EDMUND I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this 295 other
day, what should follow these eclipses.</p>
<p>EDGAR Do you busy yourself with that?</p>
<p>EDMUND I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed 296 unhappily
297 . When saw you my father last?</p>
<p>EDGAR The night gone by.</p>
<p>EDMUND Spake you with him?</p>
<p>EDGAR Ay, two hours together.</p>
<p>EDMUND Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him by
word nor countenance 298 ?</p>
<p>EDGAR None at all.</p>
<p>EDMUND Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him, and at my
entreaty forbear 299 his presence until some little time hath qualified
300 the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in him
that with the mischief of your person 301 it would scarcely allay 302
.</p>
<p>EDGAR Some villain hath done me wrong.</p>
<p>EDMUND That’s my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance 303
till the speed of his rage goes slower: and, as I say, retire with me to
my lodging, from whence I will fitly 304 bring you to hear my lord
speak. Pray ye go. There’s my key: if you do stir abroad 305 , go
armed.</p>
<p>Gives a key</p>
<p>EDGAR Armed, brother?</p>
<p>EDMUND Brother, I advise you to the best: I am no honest man if there
be any good meaning 306 toward you: I have told you what I have seen and
heard, but faintly, nothing like the image and horror 307 of it. Pray
you away.</p>
<p>EDGAR Shall I hear from you anon 308 ?</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>EDMUND I do serve 309 you in this business.—</p>
<p>A credulous father and a brother noble,</p>
<p>Whose nature is so far from doing harms</p>
<p>That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty</p>
<p>My practices 310 ride easy. I see the business.</p>
<p>Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit 311 :</p>
<p>All with me’s meet 312 that I can fashion fit 313 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
