continues</h4>
<p>Enter Caesar, Antony for 55 the course 56 , Calpurnia, Portia,
Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, a Soothsayer 57 , after them
Murellus and Flavius</p>
<p>CAESAR Calpurnia.</p>
<p>CASCA Peace, ho 58 ! Caesar speaks.</p>
<p>CAESAR Calpurnia.</p>
<p>CALPURNIA Here, my lord.</p>
<p>CAESAR Stand you directly in Antonio’s way</p>
<p>When he doth run his course 59 . Antonio!</p>
<p>ANTONY Caesar, my lord.</p>
<p>CAESAR Forget not in your speed, Antonio,</p>
<p>To touch Calpurnia, for our elders say,</p>
<p>The barren touchèd in this holy chase</p>
<p>Shake off their sterile curse.</p>
<p>ANTONY I shall remember.</p>
<p>When Caesar says ‘Do this’ it is performed.</p>
<p>CAESAR Set on, and leave no ceremony out.</p>
<p>Music</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER Caesar!</p>
<p>CAESAR Ha? Who calls?</p>
<p>CASCA Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!</p>
<p>Music stops</p>
<p>CAESAR Who is it in the press 60 that calls on me?</p>
<p>I hear a tongue shriller than all the music,</p>
<p>Cry ‘Caesar!’ Speak, Caesar is turned to hear.</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER Beware the Ides of March 61 .</p>
<p>CAESAR What man is that?</p>
<p>BRUTUS A soothsayer bids you beware the Ides of March.</p>
<p>CAESAR Set him before me: let me see his face.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Fellow, come from the throng: look upon Caesar.</p>
<p>Soothsayer comes forward</p>
<p>CAESAR What say’st thou to me now? Speak once again.</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER Beware the Ides of March.</p>
<p>CAESAR He is a dreamer. Let us leave him: pass.</p>
<p>Sennet 62 . Exeunt. Brutus and Cassius remain</p>
<p>CASSIUS Will you go see the order 63 of the course?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Not I.</p>
<p>CASSIUS I pray you do.</p>
<p>BRUTUS I am not gamesome 64 : I do lack some part</p>
<p>Of that quick 65 spirit that is in Antony.</p>
<p>Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;</p>
<p>I’ll leave you.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Brutus, I do observe you now of late 66 :</p>
<p>I have not from your eyes that gentleness</p>
<p>And show of love as I was wont 67 to have:</p>
<p>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</p>
<p>Over 68 your friend, that loves you.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Cassius,</p>
<p>Be not deceived: if I have veiled my look,</p>
<p>I turn the trouble of my countenance</p>
<p>Merely 69 upon myself 70 . Vexed I am</p>
<p>Of late with passions of some difference 71 ,</p>
<p>Conceptions 72 only proper 73 to myself</p>
<p>Which give some soil 74 , perhaps, to my behaviours.</p>
<p>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved —</p>
<p>Among which number, Cassius, be you one —</p>
<p>Nor construe 75 any further my neglect</p>
<p>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</p>
<p>Forgets the shows 76 of love to other men.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,</p>
<p>By means whereof 77 this breast of mine hath buried 78</p>
<p>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations 79 .</p>
<p>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</p>
<p>BRUTUS No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself</p>
<p>But 80 by reflection, by some other things.</p>
<p>CASSIUS ’Tis just 81 ,</p>
<p>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</p>
<p>That you have no such mirrors as will turn 82</p>
<p>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</p>
<p>That you might see your shadow 83 : I have heard,</p>
<p>Where many of the best respect 84 in Rome —</p>
<p>Except immortal Caesar — speaking of Brutus,</p>
<p>And groaning underneath this age’s yoke 85 ,</p>
<p>Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes 86 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</p>
<p>That you would have me seek into myself</p>
<p>For that which is not in me?</p>
<p>CASSIUS Therefore 87 , good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</p>
<p>And since you know you cannot see yourself</p>
<p>So well as by reflection, I your glass 88</p>
<p>Will modestly 89 discover 90 to yourself</p>
<p>That of 91 yourself which you yet know not of.</p>
<p>And be not jealous on 92 me, gentle 93 Brutus:</p>
<p>Were I a common laughter 94 , or did use 95</p>
<p>To stale 96 with ordinary 97 oaths my love</p>
<p>To every new protester 98 , if you know</p>
<p>That I do fawn on men, and hug them hard,</p>
<p>And after scandal 99 them, or if you know</p>
<p>That I profess 100 myself in banqueting</p>
<p>To all the rout 101 , then hold me dangerous.</p>
<p>Flourish 102 , and shout</p>
<p>BRUTUS What means this shouting? I do fear the people</p>
<p>Choose Caesar for their king.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Ay, do you fear it?</p>
<p>Then must I think you would not have it so.</p>
<p>BRUTUS I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.</p>
<p>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</p>
<p>What is it that you would impart to me?</p>
<p>If it be aught 103 toward the general good,</p>
<p>Set honour in one eye, and death i’th’other 104 ,</p>
<p>And I will look on both indifferently 105 .</p>
<p>For let the gods so speed 106 me, as I love</p>
<p>The name of honour more than I fear death.</p>
<p>CASSIUS I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</p>
<p>As well as I do know your outward favour 107 .</p>
<p>Well, honour is the subject of my story:</p>
<p>I cannot tell what you and other men</p>
<p>Think of this life, but for my single self,</p>
<p>I had as lief 108 not be 109 as live to be</p>
<p>In awe of such a thing as I myself 110 .</p>
<p>I was born free as Caesar, so were you:</p>
<p>We both have fed as well, and we can both</p>
<p>Endure the winter’s cold as well as he,</p>
<p>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</p>
<p>The troubled Tiber chafing with 111 her shores,</p>
<p>Caesar said to me, ’Dar’st thou, Cassius, now</p>
<p>Leap in with me into this angry flood 112</p>
<p>And swim to yonder point?’ Upon the word,</p>
<p>Accoutrèd 113 as I was, I plungèd in</p>
<p>And bade 114 him follow: so indeed he did.</p>
<p>The torrent roared, and we did buffet it 115</p>
<p>With lusty sinews 116 , throwing it aside,</p>
<p>And stemming 117 it with hearts of controversy 118 .</p>
<p>But ere 119 we could arrive the point proposed,</p>
<p>Caesar cried, ‘Help me, Cassius, or I sink!’</p>
<p>I — as Aeneas 120 , our great ancestor,</p>
<p>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</p>
<p>The old Anchises bear — so from the waves of Tiber</p>
<p>Did I the tired Caesar: and this man</p>
<p>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</p>
<p>A wretched creature, and must bend his body 121</p>
<p>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</p>
<p>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</p>
<p>And when the fit was on him I did mark 122</p>
<p>How he did shake: ’tis true, this god did shake,</p>
<p>His coward lips did from their colour fly 123 ,</p>
<p>And that same eye, whose bend 124 doth awe the world,</p>
<p>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</p>
<p>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade 125 the Romans</p>
<p>Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,</p>
<p>‘Alas’, it cried, ‘Give me some drink, Titinius’,</p>
<p>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</p>
<p>A man of such a feeble temper should</p>
<p>So get the start of 126 the majestic world</p>
<p>And bear the palm 127 alone.</p>
<p>Shout. Flourish</p>
<p>BRUTUS Another general shout?</p>
<p>I do believe that these applauses are</p>
<p>For some new honours that are heaped on Caesar.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</p>
<p>Like a Colossus 128 , and we petty men</p>
<p>Walk under his huge legs and peep about</p>
<p>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</p>
<p>Men at some time 129 are masters of their fates.</p>
<p>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars 130</p>
<p>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</p>
<p>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that ‘Caesar’?</p>
<p>Why should that name be sounded 131 more than yours?</p>
<p>Write them together, yours is as fair a name:</p>
<p>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well:</p>
<p>Weigh them, it is as heavy: conjure 132 with ’em,</p>
<p>Brutus will start 133 a spirit as soon as Caesar.</p>
<p>Now in the names of all the gods at once,</p>
<p>Upon what meat 134 doth this our Caesar feed</p>
<p>That he is grown so great 135 ? — Age 136 , thou art shamed! —</p>
<p>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of 137 noble bloods! —</p>
<p>When went there by an age, since the great flood 138 ,</p>
<p>But it was famed with more than with one man?</p>
<p>When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome,</p>
<p>That her wide walks encompassed but one man?</p>
<p>Now is it Rome indeed, and room 139 enough</p>
<p>When there is in it but one only man.</p>
<p>O, you and I have heard our fathers say</p>
<p>There was a Brutus once 140 that would have brooked 141</p>
<p>Th’eternal devil to keep his state 142 in Rome</p>
<p>As easily as a king.</p>
<p>BRUTUS That you do love me, I am nothing jealous 143 :</p>
<p>What you would work 144 me to, I have some aim 145 :</p>
<p>How I have thought of this and of these times</p>
<p>I shall recount hereafter. For this present,</p>
<p>I would not — so with love I might entreat you 146 —</p>
<p>Be any further moved 147 . What you have said</p>
<p>I will consider, what you have to say</p>
<p>I will with patience hear, and find a time</p>
<p>Both meet 148 to hear and answer such high 149 things.</p>
<p>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</p>
<p>Brutus had rather be a villager</p>
<p>Than to repute 150 himself a son of Rome</p>
<p>Under these hard conditions as this time</p>
<p>Is like 151 to lay upon us.</p>
<p>CASSIUS I am glad that my weak words</p>
<p>Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.</p>
<p>Enter Caesar and his train 152</p>
<p>BRUTUS The games are done, and Caesar is returning.</p>
<p>CASSIUS As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,</p>
<p>And he will, after 153 his sour fashion, tell you</p>
<p>What hath proceeded worthy 154 note today.</p>
<p>BRUTUS I will do so: but look you, Cassius,</p>
<p>The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow,</p>
<p>And all the rest look like a chidden 155 train:</p>
<p>Calpurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero</p>
<p>Looks with such ferret 156 and such fiery eyes</p>
<p>As we have seen him in the Capitol</p>
<p>Being crossed 157 in conference 158 by some senators.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Casca will tell us what the matter is.</p>
<p>CAESAR Antonio.</p>
<p>ANTONY Caesar?</p>
<p>CAESAR Let me have men about me that are fat,</p>
<p>Sleek-headed 159 men, and such as sleep a-nights.</p>
<p>Yond 160 Cassius has a lean and hungry look:</p>
<p>He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</p>
<p>ANTONY Fear him not, Caesar, he’s not dangerous.</p>
<p>He is a noble Roman, and well given 161 .</p>
<p>CAESAR Would 162 he were fatter! But I fear him not:</p>
<p>Yet if my name 163 were liable to fear,</p>
<p>I do not know the man I should avoid</p>
<p>So soon as that spare 164 Cassius. He reads much,</p>
<p>He is a great observer, and he looks</p>
<p>Quite through the deeds 165 of men. He loves no plays,</p>
<p>As thou dost, Antony: he hears no music:</p>
<p>Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort 166</p>
<p>As if he mocked himself, and scorned his spirit</p>
<p>That could be moved to smile at anything.</p>
<p>Such men as he be never at heart’s ease</p>
<p>Whiles they behold a greater 167 than themselves,</p>
<p>And therefore are they very dangerous.</p>
<p>I rather tell thee what is to be feared</p>
<p>Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar 168 .</p>
<p>Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,</p>
<p>And tell me truly what thou think’st of him.</p>
<p>Sennet. Exeunt Caesar and his train</p>
<p>CASCA You pulled me by the cloak: would you speak with me?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced 169 today</p>
<p>That Caesar looks so sad 170 .</p>
<p>CASCA Why, you were with him, were you not?</p>
<p>BRUTUS I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.</p>
<p>CASCA Why, there was a crown 171 offered him; and being offered him,
he put it by 172 with the back of his hand, thus, and then the people
fell a-shouting.</p>
<p>BRUTUS What was the second noise for?</p>
<p>CASCA Why, for that too.</p>
<p>CASSIUS They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?</p>
<p>CASCA Why, for that too.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Was the crown offered him thrice?</p>
<p>CASCA Ay, marry 173 , was’t, and he put it by thrice, every time
gentler 174 than other; and at every putting-by, mine honest neighbours
shouted.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Who offered him the crown?</p>
<p>CASCA Why, Antony.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</p>
<p>CASCA I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it: it was mere
175 foolery, I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown —
yet ’twas not a crown neither, ’twas one of these coronets 176 — and as
I told you, he put it by once: but for all that, to my thinking, he
would fain 177 have had it. Then he offered it to him again, then he put
it by again: but to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers
off it. And then he offered it the third time; he put it the third time
by, and still as 178 he refused it, the rabblement 179 hooted, and
clapped their chopped 180 hands, and threw up their sweaty nightcaps 181
, and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the
crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and fell down at
it. And for mine own part, I durst 182 not laugh, for fear of opening my
lips and receiving the bad air.</p>
<p>CASSIUS But soft 183 , I pray you: what, did Caesar swoon?</p>
<p>CASCA He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at mouth, and was
speechless.</p>
<p>BRUTUS ’Tis very like 184 — he hath the falling sickness 185 .</p>
<p>CASSIUS No, Caesar hath it not: but you, and I,</p>
<p>And honest Casca, we 186 have the falling sickness.</p>
<p>CASCA I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
down. If the tag-rag 187 people did not clap him and hiss him according
as he pleased and displeased them, as they use 188 to do the players in
the theatre, I am no true 189 man.</p>
<p>BRUTUS What said he when he came unto himself?</p>
<p>CASCA Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd
was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me 190 ope 191 his doublet 192
and offered them his throat to cut: an 193 I had been a man of any
occupation 194 , if I would not have taken him at a word 195 , I would
196 I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to
himself again, he said if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired
their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches
where I stood cried ‘Alas, good soul!’ and forgave him with all their
hearts: but there’s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed
197 their mothers, they would have done no less.</p>
<p>BRUTUS And after that he came thus sad away.</p>
<p>CASCA Ay.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Did Cicero say anything?</p>
<p>CASCA Ay, he spoke Greek.</p>
<p>CASSIUS To what effect?</p>
<p>CASCA Nay, and I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’th’face again.
But those that understood him smiled at one another, and shook their
heads: but, for mine own part, it was Greek to me 198 . I could tell you
more news too: Murellus and Flavius, for pulling scarves off Caesar’s
images, are put to silence 199 . Fare you well. There was more foolery
yet, if I could remember it.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?</p>
<p>CASCA No, I am promised forth 200 .</p>
<p>CASSIUS Will you dine with me tomorrow?</p>
<p>CASCA Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold 201 , and your dinner
worth the eating.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Good, I will expect you.</p>
<p>CASCA Do so. Farewell, both.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>BRUTUS What a blunt 202 fellow is this grown to be!</p>
<p>He was quick mettle 203 when he went to school.</p>
<p>CASSIUS So is he now, in execution</p>
<p>Of any bold or noble enterprise,</p>
<p>However he puts on this tardy 204 form.</p>
<p>This rudeness 205 is a sauce to his good wit 206 ,</p>
<p>Which gives men stomach 207 to digest his words</p>
<p>With better appetite.</p>
<p>BRUTUS And so it is. For this time I will leave you:</p>
<p>Tomorrow if you please to speak with me,</p>
<p>I will come home to you 208 : or if you will,</p>
<p>Come home to me, and I will wait for you.</p>
<p>CASSIUS I will do so. Till then, think of the world 209 .</p>
<p>Exit Brutus</p>
<p>Well, Brutus, thou art noble 210 : yet I see</p>
<p>Thy honourable mettle 211 may be wrought 212</p>
<p>From that it is disposed 213 : therefore it is meet 214</p>
<p>That noble minds keep ever with their likes 215</p>
<p>For who 216 so firm that cannot be seduced?</p>
<p>Caesar doth bear me hard 217 , but he loves Brutus.</p>
<p>If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,</p>
<p>He should not humour me 218 . I will this night</p>
<p>In several hands 219 in at his windows throw,</p>
<p>As if they came from several citizens,</p>
<p>Writings all tending to 220 the great opinion</p>
<p>That Rome holds of his name — wherein obscurely 221</p>
<p>Caesar’s ambition shall be glanced 222 at.</p>
<p>And after this let Caesar seat him sure 223 ,</p>
<p>For we will shake him, or worse days endure.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
