scene 1 continues</h4>
<p>Enter the corpse of Henry the Sixth with [Gentlemen bearing ]
halberds 114 to guard it, Lady Anne being the mourner</p>
<p>ANNE Set down, set down your honourable load —</p>
<p>If honour may be shrouded 115 in a hearse 116 —</p>
<p>Whilst I awhile obsequiously 117 lament</p>
<p>Th’untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster 118 .</p>
<p>They set down the coffin</p>
<p>Poor key-cold 119 figure of a holy king,</p>
<p>Pale ashes 120 of the house of Lancaster,</p>
<p>Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood,</p>
<p>Be it 121 lawful that I invocate 122 thy ghost,</p>
<p>To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,</p>
<p>Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son,</p>
<p>Stabbed by the selfsame hand that made these wounds.</p>
<p>Lo 123 , in these windows 124 that let forth thy life,</p>
<p>I pour the helpless balm 125 of my poor eyes.</p>
<p>O, cursèd be the hand that made these holes:</p>
<p>Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it:</p>
<p>Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!</p>
<p>More direful hap 126 betide 127 that hated wretch</p>
<p>That makes us wretched by the death of thee</p>
<p>Than I can wish to wolves, to spiders, toads 128 ,</p>
<p>Or any creeping venomed thing that lives.</p>
<p>If ever he have child, abortive 129 be it,</p>
<p>Prodigious 130 , and untimely brought to light,</p>
<p>Whose ugly and unnatural aspect 131</p>
<p>May fright the hopeful mother at the view,</p>
<p>And that 132 be heir to his unhappiness 133 .</p>
<p>If ever he have wife, let her be made</p>
<p>More miserable by the death of him</p>
<p>Than I am made by my young lord and thee.—</p>
<p>Come, now towards Chertsey 134 with your holy load,</p>
<p>Taken from Paul’s 135 to be interrèd there.</p>
<p>They lift the coffin</p>
<p>And still as 136 you are weary of this weight,</p>
<p>Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry’s corpse.</p>
<p>Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester</p>
<p>RICHARD Stay, you that bear the corpse, and set it down.</p>
<p>ANNE What black magician conjures up this fiend,</p>
<p>To stop devoted 137 charitable deeds?</p>
<p>RICHARD Villains, set down the corpse, or, by Saint Paul,</p>
<p>I’ll make a corpse of him that disobeys.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.</p>
<p>RICHARD Unmannered dog, stand’st thou when I command.</p>
<p>Advance 138 thy halberd higher than my breast,</p>
<p>Or, by Saint Paul, I’ll strike thee to my foot,</p>
<p>And spurn upon 139 thee, beggar, for thy boldness.</p>
<p>They set down the coffin</p>
<p>ANNE What, do you tremble? Are you all afraid?</p>
<p>Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,</p>
<p>And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.—</p>
<p>Avaunt 140 , thou dreadful minister of hell!</p>
<p>Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,</p>
<p>His soul thou canst not have: therefore be gone.</p>
<p>RICHARD Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst 141 .</p>
<p>ANNE Foul devil, for God’s sake, hence 142 , and trouble us not,</p>
<p>For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,</p>
<p>Filled it with cursing cries and deep exclaims 143 .</p>
<p>If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,</p>
<p>Behold this pattern 144 of thy butcheries.—</p>
<p>Uncovers the body</p>
<p>O, gentlemen, see, see dead Henry’s wounds</p>
<p>Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh.—</p>
<p>Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,</p>
<p>For ’tis thy presence that exhales 145 this blood 146</p>
<p>From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells.</p>
<p>Thy deeds, inhuman and unnatural,</p>
<p>Provokes this deluge most unnatural.—</p>
<p>O God, which this blood mad’st, revenge his death!</p>
<p>O earth, which this blood drink’st, revenge his death!</p>
<p>Either heav’n with lightning strike the murd’rer dead,</p>
<p>Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick,</p>
<p>As thou dost swallow up this good king’s blood</p>
<p>Which his hell-governed arm hath butcherèd!</p>
<p>RICHARD Lady, you know no rules of charity,</p>
<p>Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.</p>
<p>ANNE Villain, thou know’st nor law of God nor man:</p>
<p>No beast so 147 fierce but knows some touch of pity.</p>
<p>RICHARD But I know none, and therefore am no beast.</p>
<p>ANNE O, wonderful 148 , when devils tell the truth 149 !</p>
<p>RICHARD More wonderful, when angels are so angry.</p>
<p>Vouchsafe 150 , divine perfection of a woman,</p>
<p>Of these supposèd crimes to give me leave 151 ,</p>
<p>By circumstance 152 but to acquit myself.</p>
<p>ANNE Vouchsafe, defused 153 infection of man,</p>
<p>Of these known evils, but to give me leave,</p>
<p>By circumstance to curse thy cursèd self.</p>
<p>RICHARD Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have</p>
<p>Some patient leisure 154 to excuse myself.</p>
<p>ANNE Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make</p>
<p>No excuse current 155 , but to hang thyself.</p>
<p>RICHARD By such despair 156 , I should accuse myself.</p>
<p>ANNE And by despairing shalt thou stand excused</p>
<p>For doing worthy vengeance on thyself 157 ,</p>
<p>That didst unworthy 158 slaughter upon others.</p>
<p>RICHARD Say that I slew them not.</p>
<p>ANNE Then say they were not slain.</p>
<p>But dead they are, and devilish slave 159 , by thee.</p>
<p>RICHARD I did not kill your husband.</p>
<p>ANNE Why, then he is alive.</p>
<p>RICHARD Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward’s hands.</p>
<p>ANNE In thy foul throat thou liest 160 : Queen Margaret saw</p>
<p>Thy murd’rous falchion 161 smoking in his blood,</p>
<p>The which thou once 162 didst bend against her breast,</p>
<p>But that thy brothers beat aside the point.</p>
<p>RICHARD I was provokèd by her sland’rous tongue,</p>
<p>That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.</p>
<p>ANNE Thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind,</p>
<p>That never dream’st on aught 163 but butcheries.</p>
<p>Didst thou not kill this king?</p>
<p>RICHARD I grant ye.</p>
<p>ANNE Dost grant me, hedgehog 164 ? Then, God grant me too</p>
<p>Thou mayst be damnèd for that wicked deed.</p>
<p>O, he was gentle, mild and virtuous!</p>
<p>RICHARD The better for the king of heaven that hath him.</p>
<p>ANNE He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.</p>
<p>RICHARD Let him thank me, that holp 165 to send him thither,</p>
<p>For he was fitter for that place than earth.</p>
<p>ANNE And thou unfit for any place but hell.</p>
<p>RICHARD Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.</p>
<p>ANNE Some dungeon.</p>
<p>RICHARD Your bedchamber 166 .</p>
<p>ANNE Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest.</p>
<p>RICHARD So will it, madam, till I lie with you.</p>
<p>ANNE I hope so 167 .</p>
<p>RICHARD I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,</p>
<p>To leave this keen 168 encounter of our wits 169 ,</p>
<p>And fall something into a slower method:</p>
<p>Is not the causer of the timeless 170 deaths</p>
<p>Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,</p>
<p>As blameful as the executioner?</p>
<p>ANNE Thou wast the cause and most accursed effect 171 .</p>
<p>RICHARD Your beauty was the cause of that effect.</p>
<p>Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleep</p>
<p>To undertake the death of all the world,</p>
<p>So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.</p>
<p>ANNE If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide 172 ,</p>
<p>These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.</p>
<p>RICHARD These eyes could never endure that beauty’s wreck.</p>
<p>You should not blemish it, if I stood by:</p>
<p>As all the world is cheerèd by the sun,</p>
<p>So I by that: it is my day, my life.</p>
<p>ANNE Black night o’ershade thy day, and death thy life.</p>
<p>RICHARD Curse not thyself, fair creature: thou art both 173 .</p>
<p>ANNE I would 174 I were, to be revenged on thee.</p>
<p>RICHARD It is a quarrel most unnatural</p>
<p>To be revenged on him that loveth thee.</p>
<p>ANNE It is a quarrel just and reasonable</p>
<p>To be revenged on him that killed my husband.</p>
<p>RICHARD He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,</p>
<p>Did it to help thee to a better husband.</p>
<p>ANNE His better doth not breathe upon the earth.</p>
<p>RICHARD He lives 175 that loves thee better than he could.</p>
<p>ANNE Name him.</p>
<p>RICHARD Plantagenet 176 .</p>
<p>ANNE Why, that was he.</p>
<p>RICHARD The selfsame name, but one of better nature.</p>
<p>ANNE Where is he?</p>
<p>RICHARD Here.</p>
<p>Spits at him</p>
<p>Why dost thou spit at me?</p>
<p>ANNE Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake.</p>
<p>RICHARD Never came poison from so sweet a place.</p>
<p>ANNE Never hung poison on a fouler toad.</p>
<p>Out of my sight, thou dost infect mine eyes.</p>
<p>RICHARD Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine 177 .</p>
<p>ANNE Would they were basilisks 178 , to strike thee dead.</p>
<p>RICHARD I would they were, that I might die 179 at once,</p>
<p>For now they kill me with a living death.</p>
<p>Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,</p>
<p>Shamed their aspects 180 with store of childish drops:</p>
<p>These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear —</p>
<p>No, when 181 my father York and Edward wept,</p>
<p>To hear the piteous moan that Rutland 182 made</p>
<p>When black-faced 183 Clifford shook his sword at him,</p>
<p>Nor when thy warlike father 184 , like a child,</p>
<p>Told the sad story of my father’s death,</p>
<p>And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,</p>
<p>That 185 all the standers-by had wet their cheeks</p>
<p>Like trees bedashed 186 with rain: in that sad time,</p>
<p>My manly eyes did scorn an humble 187 tear.</p>
<p>And what these sorrows could not thence exhale 188 ,</p>
<p>Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.</p>
<p>I never sued 189 to friend nor enemy:</p>
<p>My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing 190 word.</p>
<p>But now thy beauty is proposed my fee 191 ,</p>
<p>My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.</p>
<p>She looks scornfully at him</p>
<p>Teach not thy lip such scorn, for it was made</p>
<p>For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.</p>
<p>If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,</p>
<p>Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword,</p>
<p>Gives her his sword</p>
<p>Which if thou please to hide in this true breast.</p>
<p>↓ Kneels ↓</p>
<p>And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,</p>
<p>I lay it naked to the deadly stroke</p>
<p>And humbly beg the death upon my knee.</p>
<p>He lays his breast open 192 : she offers 193 set me on 194 at [it ]
with his sword</p>
<p>Nay, do not pause, for I did kill King Henry —</p>
<p>But ’twas thy beauty that provokèd me.</p>
<p>Nay, now dispatch: ’twas I that stabbed young Edward —</p>
<p>But ’twas thy heavenly face that set me on.</p>
<p>She falls 195 the sword</p>
<p>Take up the sword again, or take up me 196 .</p>
<p>ANNE Arise, dissembler 197 . Though I wish thy death,</p>
<p>I will not be thy executioner.</p>
<p>RICHARD Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.</p>
<p>Takes his sword back</p>
<p>ANNE I have already.</p>
<p>RICHARD That was in thy rage:</p>
<p>Speak it again, and even with the word,</p>
<p>This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,</p>
<p>Shall for thy love kill a far truer love 198 .</p>
<p>To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory.</p>
<p>ANNE I would I knew thy heart.</p>
<p>RICHARD ’Tis figured in 199 my tongue.</p>
<p>ANNE I fear me both are false.</p>
<p>RICHARD Then never man was true.</p>
<p>ANNE Well, well, put up your sword.</p>
<p>RICHARD Say, then, my peace is made.</p>
<p>ANNE That shalt thou know hereafter.</p>
<p>RICHARD But shall I live in hope?</p>
<p>ANNE All men, I hope, live so.</p>
<p>RICHARD Vouchsafe to wear this ring.</p>
<p>Puts a ring on her</p>
<p>Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger.</p>
<p>Even so 200 thy breast encloseth my poor heart:</p>
<p>Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.</p>
<p>And if thy poor devoted servant may</p>
<p>But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,</p>
<p>Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.</p>
<p>ANNE What is it?</p>
<p>RICHARD That it may please you leave these sad designs</p>
<p>To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,</p>
<p>And presently 201 repair to Crosby House 202 ,</p>
<p>Where after I have solemnly interred</p>
<p>At Chertsey monast’ry this noble king,</p>
<p>And wet his grave with my repentant tears —</p>
<p>I will with all expedient 203 duty see you.</p>
<p>For divers 204 unknown 205 reasons, I beseech you,</p>
<p>Grant me this boon 206 .</p>
<p>ANNE With all my heart, and much it joys me too,</p>
<p>To see you are become so penitent.—</p>
<p>Tressell and Berkeley 207 , go along with me.</p>
<p>RICHARD Bid me farewell.</p>
<p>ANNE ’Tis more than you deserve,</p>
<p>But since you teach me how to flatter you,</p>
<p>Imagine I have said farewell already.</p>
<p>Exeunt two [Tressell and Berkeley ] with Anne</p>
<p>GENTLEMEN Towards Chertsey, noble lord?</p>
<p>RICHARD No, to Whitefriars 208 . There attend my coming.</p>
<p>Exit corpse [borne by the other gentlemen ]</p>
<p>Was ever woman in this humour 209 wooed?</p>
<p>Was ever woman in this humour won?</p>
<p>I’ll have her, but I will not keep her long.</p>
<p>What? I, that killed her husband and his father,</p>
<p>To take her in her heart’s extremest hate,</p>
<p>With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,</p>
<p>The bleeding witness 210 of my hatred by 211 ,</p>
<p>Having God, her conscience, and these bars 212 against me,</p>
<p>And I no friends to back my suit 213 withal 214 ,</p>
<p>But the plain devil and dissembling looks?</p>
<p>And yet to win her, all the world to nothing 215 ?</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>Hath she forgot already that brave 216 prince,</p>
<p>Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,</p>
<p>Stabbed in my angry mood 217 at Tewkesbury 218 ?</p>
<p>A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,</p>
<p>Framed in the prodigality of nature 219 ,</p>
<p>Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal 220 ,</p>
<p>The spacious world cannot again afford.</p>
<p>And will she yet abase her eyes on me,</p>
<p>That cropped the golden prime 221 of this sweet prince,</p>
<p>And made her widow to a woeful bed?</p>
<p>On me, whose all not equals Edward’s moiety 222 ?</p>
<p>On me, that halt 223 s and am misshapen 224 thus?</p>
<p>My dukedom to a beggarly denier 225 !</p>
<p>I do mistake my person all this while.</p>
<p>Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,</p>
<p>Myself to be a marv’llous proper 226 man.</p>
<p>I’ll be at charges for 227 a looking-glass,</p>
<p>And entertain 228 a score or two of 229 tailors</p>
<p>To study fashions to adorn my body.</p>
<p>Since I am crept in 230 favour with myself,</p>
<p>I will maintain it with some little cost.</p>
<p>But first I’ll turn yon fellow in his grave,</p>
<p>And then return lamenting to my love.</p>
<p>Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass 231 ,</p>
<p>That I may see my shadow 232 as I pass.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
