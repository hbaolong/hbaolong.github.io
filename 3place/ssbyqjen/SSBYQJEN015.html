<h4 id="scene-1running-scene-9">Scene 1／running scene 9</h4>
<p>Enter Prospero in his magic robes, and Ariel</p>
<p>PROSPERO Now does my project 978 gather to a head 979 .</p>
<p>My charms crack not 980 , my spirits obey, and Time</p>
<p>Goes upright with his carriage 981 . How’s the day? 982</p>
<p>ARIEL On the sixth hour, at which time, my lord,</p>
<p>You said our work should cease.</p>
<p>PROSPERO I did say so,</p>
<p>When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,</p>
<p>How fares the king and’s followers?</p>
<p>ARIEL Confined together</p>
<p>In the same fashion as you gave in charge 983 ,</p>
<p>Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,</p>
<p>In the line-grove 984 which weather-fends 985 your cell:</p>
<p>They cannot budge till your release. The king,</p>
<p>His brother, and yours abide 986 all three distracted 987 ,</p>
<p>And the remainder mourning over them,</p>
<p>Brimful of sorrow and dismay: but chiefly</p>
<p>Him that you termed 988 , sir, the good old lord Gonzalo:</p>
<p>His tears run down his beard, like winter’s drops</p>
<p>From eaves of reeds 989 . Your charm so strongly works ’em</p>
<p>That if you now beheld them, your affections 990</p>
<p>Would become tender.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Dost thou think so, spirit?</p>
<p>ARIEL Mine would, sir, were I human.</p>
<p>PROSPERO And mine shall.</p>
<p>Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling</p>
<p>Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,</p>
<p>One of their kind, that relish all as sharply</p>
<p>Passion 991 as they, be kindlier moved 992 than thou art?</p>
<p>Though with their high 993 wrongs I am struck to th’quick 994 ,</p>
<p>Yet with my nobler reason gainst my fury</p>
<p>Do I take part 995 : the rarer 996 action is</p>
<p>In virtue than 997 in vengeance. They being penitent,</p>
<p>The sole drift 998 of my purpose doth extend</p>
<p>Not a frown further. Go, release them, Ariel:</p>
<p>My charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll restore,</p>
<p>And they shall be themselves.</p>
<p>ARIEL I’ll fetch them, sir.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>PROSPERO Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing 999 lakes and
groves,</p>
<p>And ye that on the sands with printless foot 1000</p>
<p>Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly 1001 him</p>
<p>When he comes back: you demi-puppets 1002 that</p>
<p>By moonshine do the green sour ringlets 1003 make,</p>
<p>Whereof the ewe not bites 1004 : and you whose pastime</p>
<p>Is to make midnight mushrooms 1005 , that rejoice</p>
<p>To hear the solemn curfew 1006 , by whose aid —</p>
<p>Weak masters 1007 though ye be — I have bedimmed 1008</p>
<p>The noontide sun, called forth the mutinous winds,</p>
<p>And ’twixt the green sea and the azured vault 1009</p>
<p>Set roaring war 1010 : to the dread rattling thunder</p>
<p>Have I given fire 1011 , and rifted 1012 Jove’s stout oak 1013</p>
<p>With his own bolt: the strong-based promontory 1014</p>
<p>Have I made shake and by the spurs 1015 plucked up</p>
<p>The pine and cedar. Graves at my command</p>
<p>Have waked their sleepers, oped 1016 , and let ’em forth</p>
<p>By my so potent art. But this rough 1017 magic</p>
<p>Prospero traces a circle with his staff</p>
<p>I here abjure 1018 : and when I have required 1019</p>
<p>Some heavenly music — which even now I do —</p>
<p>To work mine end 1020 upon their senses that</p>
<p>This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff,</p>
<p>Bury it certain 1021 fathoms 1022 in the earth,</p>
<p>And deeper than did ever plummet 1023 sound 1024</p>
<p>I’ll drown my book.</p>
<p>Solemn music. Here enters Ariel before: then Alonso, with a frantic
1025 gesture, attended by Gonzalo: Sebastian and Antonio in like manner,
attended by Adrian and Francisco. They all enter the circle which
Prospero had made, and there stand charmed: which Prospero observing,
speaks:</p>
<p>A solemn air 1026 , and the best comforter</p>
<p>To Alonso</p>
<p>To an unsettled fancy 1027 , cure thy brains,</p>
<p>Now useless, boil 1028 within thy skull!— There stand,</p>
<p>To Sebastian and Antonio</p>
<p>For you are spell-stopped 1029 .</p>
<p>Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,</p>
<p>To Gonzalo</p>
<p>Mine eyes, ev’n sociable 1030 to the show 1031 of thine,</p>
<p>Fall fellowly 1032 drops.— The charm dissolves apace 1033 ,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>And as the morning steals upon the night,</p>
<p>Melting the darkness, so their rising 1034 senses</p>
<p>Begin to chase the ignorant 1035 fumes that mantle 1036</p>
<p>Their clearer reason.— O good Gonzalo,</p>
<p>My true 1037 preserver, and a loyal sir</p>
<p>To him thou follow’st 1038 , I will pay thy graces</p>
<p>Home 1039 both in word and deed.— Most cruelly</p>
<p>Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:</p>
<p>Thy brother was a furtherer 1040 in the act.—</p>
<p>Thou art pinched for’t now, Sebastian.— Flesh and blood,</p>
<p>To Antonio</p>
<p>You, brother mine, that entertain 1041 ambition,</p>
<p>Expelled remorse and nature 1042 : whom, with Sebastian —</p>
<p>Whose inward pinches 1043 therefore are most strong —</p>
<p>Would here have killed your king: I do forgive thee,</p>
<p>Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding</p>
<p>Begins to swell, and the approaching tide</p>
<p>Will shortly fill the reasonable shore 1044</p>
<p>That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them</p>
<p>That yet looks on me or would know me. Ariel,</p>
<p>Fetch me the hat and rapier 1045 in my cell:</p>
<p>I will discase 1046 me, and myself present</p>
<p>As I was sometime Milan 1047 . Quickly, spirit:</p>
<p>Thou shalt ere long be free.</p>
<p>Ariel gets hat and rapier 1048 , returns immediately</p>
<p>Ariel sings and helps to attire him:</p>
<p>ARIEL Where the bee sucks, there suck I:</p>
<p>In a cowslip’s bell 1049 I lie:</p>
<p>There I couch 1050 when owls do cry.</p>
<p>On the bat’s back I do fly</p>
<p>After summer merrily.</p>
<p>Merrily, merrily shall I live now</p>
<p>Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Why, that’s my dainty Ariel. I shall miss</p>
<p>Thee: but yet thou shalt have freedom. So, so, so.</p>
<p>Arranges his attire</p>
<p>To the king’s ship, invisible as thou art:</p>
<p>There shalt thou find the mariners asleep</p>
<p>Under the hatches: the master and the boatswain</p>
<p>Being awake, enforce 1051 them to this place;</p>
<p>And presently 1052 , I prithee.</p>
<p>ARIEL I drink the air 1053 before me, and return</p>
<p>Or ere 1054 your pulse twice beat.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>GONZALO All torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement</p>
<p>Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us</p>
<p>Out of this fearful 1055 country!</p>
<p>PROSPERO Behold, sir king,</p>
<p>The wrongèd Duke of Milan, Prospero:</p>
<p>For more assurance that a living prince</p>
<p>Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body,</p>
<p>And to thee and thy company, I bid</p>
<p>Embraces him</p>
<p>A hearty welcome.</p>
<p>ALONSO Whether thou be’st he or no,</p>
<p>Or some enchanted trifle 1056 to abuse 1057 me —</p>
<p>As late I have been — I not know: thy pulse</p>
<p>Beats as of flesh and blood: and since I saw thee</p>
<p>Th’affliction of my mind amends 1058 , with which</p>
<p>I fear a madness held me: this must crave —</p>
<p>An if this be at all 1059 — a most strange story.</p>
<p>Thy dukedom I resign 1060 , and do entreat</p>
<p>Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero</p>
<p>Be living and be here?</p>
<p>PROSPERO First, noble friend,</p>
<p>To Gonzalo</p>
<p>Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot</p>
<p>Be measured or confined.</p>
<p>GONZALO Whether this be</p>
<p>Or be not 1061 , I’ll not swear.</p>
<p>PROSPERO You do yet taste</p>
<p>Some subtleties 1062 o’th’isle, that will not let you</p>
<p>Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all.—</p>
<p>But you, my brace 1063 of lords, were I so minded,</p>
<p>Aside to Sebastian and Antonio</p>
<p>I here could pluck his highness’ frown upon you 1064 ,</p>
<p>And justify you traitors: at this time,</p>
<p>I will tell no tales.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN The devil speaks in him.</p>
<p>Aside to Antonio, but overheard by Prospero</p>
<p>PROSPERO No.—</p>
<p>For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother</p>
<p>To Antonio</p>
<p>Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive</p>
<p>Thy rankest 1065 fault — all of them — and require</p>
<p>My dukedom of thee, which perforce 1066 I know</p>
<p>Thou must restore.</p>
<p>ALONSO If thou be’st Prospero,</p>
<p>Give us particulars of thy preservation:</p>
<p>How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since</p>
<p>Were wrecked upon this shore? Where I have lost —</p>
<p>How sharp the point of this remembrance is —</p>
<p>My dear son Ferdinand.</p>
<p>PROSPERO I am woe 1067 for’t, sir.</p>
<p>ALONSO Irreparable is the loss, and Patience</p>
<p>Says it is past her cure.</p>
<p>PROSPERO I rather think</p>
<p>You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace</p>
<p>For the like 1068 loss, I have her sovereign 1069 aid,</p>
<p>And rest myself content 1070 .</p>
<p>ALONSO You the like loss?</p>
<p>PROSPERO As great to me as late 1071 , and supportable</p>
<p>To make the dear loss have I means much weaker 1072</p>
<p>Than you may call to comfort you: for I</p>
<p>Have lost my daughter.</p>
<p>ALONSO A daughter?</p>
<p>O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,</p>
<p>The king and queen there! That 1073 they were, I wish</p>
<p>Myself were mudded in that oozy bed</p>
<p>Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?</p>
<p>PROSPERO In this last tempest. I perceive these lords</p>
<p>At this encounter do so much admire 1074</p>
<p>That they devour their reason 1075 and scarce think</p>
<p>Their eyes do offices of truth 1076 : their words</p>
<p>Are natural breath 1077 . But, howsoe’er you have</p>
<p>Been justled 1078 from your senses, know for certain</p>
<p>That I am Prospero, and that very duke</p>
<p>Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely</p>
<p>Upon this shore, where you were wrecked, was landed</p>
<p>To be the lord on’t 1079 . No more yet of this,</p>
<p>For ’tis a chronicle of day 1080 by day,</p>
<p>Not a relation 1081 for a breakfast, nor</p>
<p>Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir:</p>
<p>This cell’s my court: here have I few attendants,</p>
<p>And subjects none abroad 1082 : pray you look in.</p>
<p>My dukedom since you have given me again,</p>
<p>I will requite 1083 you with as good a thing,</p>
<p>At least bring forth a wonder 1084 , to content ye</p>
<p>As much as me my dukedom.</p>
<p>Here Prospero discovers Ferdinand and Miranda playing at chess</p>
<p>MIRANDA Sweet lord, you play me false 1085 .</p>
<p>FERDINAND No, my dearest love,</p>
<p>I would not for the world.</p>
<p>MIRANDA Yes, for a score 1086 of kingdoms you should wrangle 1087
,</p>
<p>And I would call it fair play.</p>
<p>ALONSO If this prove</p>
<p>A vision of the island, one dear son</p>
<p>Shall I twice lose.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN A most high miracle 1088 .</p>
<p>FERDINAND Though the seas threaten, they are merciful:</p>
<p>I have cursed them without cause.</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>ALONSO Now all the blessings</p>
<p>Of a glad father compass 1089 thee about.</p>
<p>Arise, and say how thou cam’st here.</p>
<p>MIRANDA O wonder!</p>
<p>How many goodly 1090 creatures are there here!</p>
<p>How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,</p>
<p>That has such people in’t.</p>
<p>PROSPERO ’Tis new to thee.</p>
<p>ALONSO What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?</p>
<p>To Ferdinand</p>
<p>Your eld’st 1091 acquaintance cannot be three hours:</p>
<p>Is she the goddess that hath severed us,</p>
<p>And brought us thus together?</p>
<p>FERDINAND Sir, she is mortal:</p>
<p>But by immortal providence, she’s mine:</p>
<p>I chose her when I could not ask my father</p>
<p>For his advice, nor thought I had one 1092 . She</p>
<p>Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,</p>
<p>Of whom so often I have heard renown 1093 ,</p>
<p>But never saw before: of whom I have</p>
<p>Received a second life: and second father</p>
<p>This lady makes him to me.</p>
<p>ALONSO I am hers 1094 .</p>
<p>But, O, how oddly will it sound that I</p>
<p>Must ask my child forgiveness.</p>
<p>PROSPERO There sir, stop:</p>
<p>Let us not burden our remembrances with</p>
<p>A heaviness 1095 that’s gone.</p>
<p>GONZALO I have inly 1096 wept,</p>
<p>Or should have spoke ere this. Look down you gods,</p>
<p>And on this couple drop a blessèd crown.</p>
<p>For it is you that have chalked forth 1097 the way</p>
<p>Which brought us hither.</p>
<p>ALONSO I say amen, Gonzalo.</p>
<p>GONZALO Was Milan 1098 thrust from Milan that his issue</p>
<p>Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice</p>
<p>Beyond a common joy, and set it down</p>
<p>With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage</p>
<p>Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,</p>
<p>And Ferdinand her brother found a wife</p>
<p>Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom</p>
<p>In a poor isle, and all of us our selves</p>
<p>When no man was his own.</p>
<p>ALONSO Give me your hands:</p>
<p>To Ferdinand and Miranda</p>
<p>Let grief and sorrow still 1099 embrace his heart 1100</p>
<p>That doth not wish you joy.</p>
<p>GONZALO Be it so. Amen!</p>
<p>Enter Ariel, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following</p>
<p>O, look, sir, look, sir! Here is more of us!</p>
<p>I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,</p>
<p>This fellow could not drown.— Now, blasphemy,</p>
<p>To Boatswain</p>
<p>That swear’st grace o’erboard, not an oath on shore 1101 ?</p>
<p>Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?</p>
<p>BOATSWAIN The best news is that we have safely found</p>
<p>Our king and company: the next, our ship,</p>
<p>Which but three glasses 1102 since we gave out 1103 split,</p>
<p>Is tight and yare 1104 and bravely rigged as when</p>
<p>We first put out to sea.</p>
<p>ARIEL Sir, all this service</p>
<p>Aside to Prospero</p>
<p>Have I done since I went.</p>
<p>PROSPERO My tricksy 1105 spirit!</p>
<p>Aside to Ariel</p>
<p>ALONSO These are not natural events: they strengthen</p>
<p>From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?</p>
<p>BOATSWAIN If I did think, sir, I were well awake,</p>
<p>I’d strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,</p>
<p>And — how we know not — all clapped under hatches 1106 ,</p>
<p>Where, but even now, with strange and several 1107 noises</p>
<p>Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,</p>
<p>And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,</p>
<p>We were awaked: straightway at liberty 1108 ,</p>
<p>Where we, in all our trim 1109 , freshly beheld</p>
<p>Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master</p>
<p>Cap’ring 1110 to eye her. On a trice 1111 , so please you,</p>
<p>Even in a dream, were we divided from them</p>
<p>And were brought moping 1112 hither.</p>
<p>ARIEL Was’t well done?</p>
<p>Aside to Prospero</p>
<p>PROSPERO Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.</p>
<p>Aside to Ariel</p>
<p>ALONSO This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod,</p>
<p>And there is in this business more than nature</p>
<p>Was ever conduct 1113 of: some oracle</p>
<p>Must rectify our knowledge.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Sir, my liege,</p>
<p>Do not infest your mind with beating 1114 on</p>
<p>The strangeness of this business. At picked leisure 1115 —</p>
<p>Which shall be shortly single 1116 — I’ll resolve you,</p>
<p>Which to you shall seem probable 1117 , of every</p>
<p>These happened accidents 1118 . Till when, be cheerful</p>
<p>And think of each thing well 1119 .— Come hither, spirit,</p>
<p>Aside to Ariel</p>
<p>Set Caliban and his companions free:</p>
<p>Untie the spell.—</p>
<p>[Exit Ariel ]</p>
<p>How fares my gracious sir?</p>
<p>To Alonso</p>
<p>There are yet missing of your company</p>
<p>Some few odd lads that you remember not.</p>
<p>Enter Ariel, driving in Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo, in their
stolen apparel</p>
<p>STEPHANO Every man shift 1120 for all the rest, and let no man take
care for himself: for all is but fortune 1121 . Coraggio 1122 , bully
1123 -monster, coraggio !</p>
<p>TRINCULO If these be true spies 1124 which I wear in my head, here’s
a goodly sight.</p>
<p>CALIBAN O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!</p>
<p>How fine my master is! I am afraid</p>
<p>He will chastise me.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Ha, ha!</p>
<p>What things are these, my lord Antonio?</p>
<p>Will money buy ’em?</p>
<p>ANTONIO Very like 1125 . One of them</p>
<p>Is a plain fish 1126 , and no doubt marketable.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Mark but the badges 1127 of these men, my lords,</p>
<p>Then say if they be true 1128 . This misshapen knave,</p>
<p>His mother was a witch, and one so strong</p>
<p>That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,</p>
<p>And deal in her command without her power 1129 :</p>
<p>These three have robbed me, and this demi-devil —</p>
<p>For he’s a bastard 1130 one — had plotted with them</p>
<p>To take my life. Two of these fellows you</p>
<p>Must know and own: this thing of darkness I</p>
<p>Acknowledge mine.</p>
<p>CALIBAN I shall be pinched to death.</p>
<p>ALONSO Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN He is drunk now: where had he wine?</p>
<p>ALONSO And Trinculo is reeling ripe 1131 : where should they</p>
<p>Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 1132 ’em?</p>
<p>How cam’st thou in this pickle 1133 ?</p>
<p>To Trinculo</p>
<p>TRINCULO I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that I
fear me will never out of my bones 1134 : I shall not fear fly-blowing
1135 .</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Why, how now, Stephano?</p>
<p>STEPHANO O, touch me not: I am not Stephano, but a cramp 1136 .</p>
<p>PROSPERO You’d be king o’the isle, sirrah 1137 ?</p>
<p>STEPHANO I should have been a sore 1138 one then.</p>
<p>ALONSO This is a strange thing as e’er I looked on.</p>
<p>Points to Caliban</p>
<p>PROSPERO He is as disproportioned in his manners 1139</p>
<p>As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell:</p>
<p>Take with you your companions: as you look</p>
<p>To have my pardon, trim it handsomely 1140 .</p>
<p>CALIBAN Ay, that I will: and I’ll be wise hereafter,</p>
<p>And seek for grace 1141 . What a thrice-double 1142 ass</p>
<p>Was I to take this drunkard for a god</p>
<p>And worship this dull fool!</p>
<p>PROSPERO Go to, away!</p>
<p>ALONSO Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Or stole it, rather.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo ]</p>
<p>PROSPERO Sir, I invite your highness and your train</p>
<p>To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest</p>
<p>For this one night: which, part of it, I’ll waste 1143</p>
<p>With such discourse as I not doubt shall make it</p>
<p>Go quick away: the story of my life</p>
<p>And the particular accidents 1144 gone by</p>
<p>Since I came to this isle: and in the morn</p>
<p>I’ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,</p>
<p>Where I have hope to see the nuptial</p>
<p>Of these our dear-belovèd solemnized 1145 ,</p>
<p>And thence retire me to my Milan, where</p>
<p>Every third thought 1146 shall be my grave.</p>
<p>ALONSO I long</p>
<p>To hear the story of your life, which must</p>
<p>Take the ear strangely 1147 .</p>
<p>PROSPERO I’ll deliver all,</p>
<p>And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales</p>
<p>And sail so expeditious 1148 that shall catch 1149</p>
<p>Your royal fleet far off.— My Ariel, chick,</p>
<p>That is thy charge: then to the elements</p>
<p>Be free, and fare thou well.— Please you, draw near 1150 .</p>
<p>Exeunt [all but Prospero ]</p>
<p>EPILOGUE SPOKEN BY PROSPERO</p>
<p>Now my charms are all o’erthrown 1151 ,</p>
<p>And what strength I have’s mine own,</p>
<p>Which is most faint: now ’tis true,</p>
<p>I must be here confined by you 1152 ,</p>
<p>Or sent to Naples. Let me not,</p>
<p>Since I have my dukedom got</p>
<p>And pardoned the deceiver, dwell</p>
<p>In this bare island by your spell,</p>
<p>But release me from my bands 1153</p>
<p>With the help of your good hands 1154 :</p>
<p>Gentle breath 1155 of yours my sails</p>
<p>Must fill, or else my project fails,</p>
<p>Which was to please. Now I want 1156</p>
<p>Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,</p>
<p>And my ending is despair,</p>
<p>Unless I be relieved by prayer 1157 ,</p>
<p>Which pierces so, that it assaults 1158</p>
<p>Mercy itself, and frees all faults.</p>
<p>As you from crimes would pardoned be,</p>
<p>Let your indulgence 1159 set me free.</p>
<p>Awaits applause</p>
<p>Exit</p>
