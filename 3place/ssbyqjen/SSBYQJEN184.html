18</h4>
<p>Enter the Duke, the Magnificoes, Antonio, Bassanio and Gratiano [with
Salerio and others ]</p>
<p>DUKE What, is Antonio here?</p>
<p>ANTONIO Ready, so please your grace.</p>
<p>DUKE I am sorry for thee. Thou art come to answer 1124</p>
<p>A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch</p>
<p>Uncapable of pity, void and empty</p>
<p>From 1125 any dram 1126 of mercy.</p>
<p>ANTONIO I have heard</p>
<p>Your grace hath ta’en great pains to qualify 1127</p>
<p>His rigorous course, but since he stands obdurate 1128</p>
<p>And that no lawful means can carry me</p>
<p>Out of his envy’s 1129 reach, I do oppose</p>
<p>My patience to his fury, and am armed</p>
<p>To suffer with a quietness of spirit</p>
<p>The very tyranny 1130 and rage of his.</p>
<p>DUKE Go one, and call the Jew into the court.</p>
<p>SALERIO He is ready at the door. He comes, my lord.</p>
<p>Enter Shylock</p>
<p>DUKE Make room, and let him stand before our 1131 face.</p>
<p>Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,</p>
<p>That thou but lead’st this fashion 1132 of thy malice</p>
<p>To the last hour of act 1133 , and then ’tis thought</p>
<p>Thou’lt show thy mercy and remorse 1134 more strange 1135</p>
<p>Than is thy strange 1136 apparent cruelty;</p>
<p>And where thou now exact’st the penalty,</p>
<p>Which is a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh,</p>
<p>Thou wilt not only loose 1137 the forfeiture,</p>
<p>But, touched with humane gentleness and love,</p>
<p>Forgive a moiety 1138 of the principal,</p>
<p>Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,</p>
<p>That have of late so huddled on his back,</p>
<p>Enow to press a royal merchant 1139 down</p>
<p>And pluck commiseration of his state</p>
<p>From brassy bosoms 1140 and rough hearts of flints,</p>
<p>From stubborn Turks and Tartars 1141 , never trained</p>
<p>To offices of tender courtesy.</p>
<p>We all expect a gentle 1142 answer, Jew.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I have possessed 1143 your grace of what I purpose,</p>
<p>And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn</p>
<p>To have the due 1144 and forfeit of my bond.</p>
<p>If you deny it, let the danger 1145 light</p>
<p>Upon your charter 1146 and your city’s freedom.</p>
<p>You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have</p>
<p>A weight of carrion 1147 flesh than to receive</p>
<p>Three thousand ducats: I’ll not answer that,</p>
<p>But say it is my humour 1148 ; is it answered 1149 ?</p>
<p>What if my house be troubled with a rat</p>
<p>And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats</p>
<p>To have it baned 1150 ? What, are you answered yet?</p>
<p>Some men there are love 1151 not a gaping pig,</p>
<p>Some that are mad if they behold a cat,</p>
<p>And others when the bagpipe sings i’th’nose 1152</p>
<p>Cannot contain their urine, for affection 1153 ,</p>
<p>Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood</p>
<p>Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:</p>
<p>As there is no firm reason to be rendered,</p>
<p>Why he 1154 cannot abide a gaping 1155 pig,</p>
<p>Why he 1156 , a harmless necessary 1157 cat,</p>
<p>Why he, a woollen bagpipe, but of force</p>
<p>Must yield to such inevitable shame</p>
<p>As to offend, himself being offended.</p>
<p>So can I give no reason, nor I will not,</p>
<p>More than a lodged 1158 hate and a certain 1159 loathing</p>
<p>I bear Antonio, that I follow 1160 thus</p>
<p>A losing 1161 suit against him. Are you answered?</p>
<p>BASSANIO This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,</p>
<p>To excuse the current 1162 of thy cruelty.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I am not bound to please thee with my answer.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Do all men kill the things they do not love?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Hates any man the thing he would not kill?</p>
<p>BASSANIO Every offence is not a hate at first.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?</p>
<p>ANTONIO I pray you think 1163 you question with the Jew:</p>
<p>You may as well go stand upon the beach</p>
<p>And bid the main flood 1164 bate 1165 his usual height,</p>
<p>Or even as well use question 1166 with the wolf</p>
<p>Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb.</p>
<p>You may as well forbid the mountain pines</p>
<p>To wag 1167 their high tops and to make no noise</p>
<p>When they are fretted 1168 with the gusts of heaven.</p>
<p>You may as well do anything most hard 1169</p>
<p>As seek to soften that — than 1170 which what harder? —</p>
<p>His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you</p>
<p>Make no more offers, use no further means,</p>
<p>But with all brief and plain conveniency 1171</p>
<p>Let me have judgement and the Jew his will.</p>
<p>BASSANIO For thy three thousand ducats here is six.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK If every ducat in six thousand ducats</p>
<p>Were in six parts and every part a ducat,</p>
<p>I would not draw 1172 them. I would have my bond!</p>
<p>DUKE How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend’ring 1173 none?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK What judgement shall I dread, doing no wrong 1174 ?</p>
<p>You have among you many a purchased slave,</p>
<p>Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,</p>
<p>You use in abject and in slavish parts 1175 ,</p>
<p>Because you bought them. Shall I say to you,</p>
<p>Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?</p>
<p>Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds</p>
<p>Be made as soft as yours and let their palates</p>
<p>Be seasoned with such viands 1176 ? You will answer</p>
<p>‘The slaves are ours.’ So do I answer you:</p>
<p>The pound of flesh which I demand of him</p>
<p>Is dearly bought, ’tis mine and I will have it.</p>
<p>If you deny me, fie upon your law!</p>
<p>There is no force in the decrees of Venice.</p>
<p>I stand for 1177 judgement. Answer: shall I have it?</p>
<p>DUKE Upon my power I may dismiss this court,</p>
<p>Unless Bellario, a learnèd doctor,</p>
<p>Whom I have sent for to determine this,</p>
<p>Come here today.</p>
<p>SALERIO My lord, here stays without 1178</p>
<p>A messenger with letters from the doctor,</p>
<p>New come from Padua.</p>
<p>DUKE Bring us the letters. Call the messenger.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!</p>
<p>The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,</p>
<p>Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.</p>
<p>ANTONIO I am a tainted 1179 wether 1180 of the flock,</p>
<p>Meetest 1181 for death. The weakest kind of fruit</p>
<p>Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me;</p>
<p>You cannot better be employed, Bassanio,</p>
<p>Than to live still and write mine epitaph.</p>
<p>Enter Nerissa [dressed like a law clerk ]</p>
<p>DUKE Came you from Padua, from Bellario?</p>
<p>NERISSA From both. My lord Bellario greets your grace.</p>
<p>She gives the Duke a letter while Shylock whets his knife on his
shoe</p>
<p>BASSANIO Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.</p>
<p>GRATIANO Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,</p>
<p>Thou mak’st thy knife keen 1182 . But no metal can,</p>
<p>No, not the hangman’s 1183 axe, bear half the keenness 1184</p>
<p>Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.</p>
<p>GRATIANO O, be thou damned, inexecrable 1185 dog!</p>
<p>And for thy life 1186 let justice be accused 1187 .</p>
<p>Thou almost mak’st me waver in my faith</p>
<p>To hold opinion with Pythagoras 1188 ,</p>
<p>That souls of animals infuse themselves</p>
<p>Into the trunks of men. Thy currish 1189 spirit</p>
<p>Governed a wolf who, hanged for human slaughter,</p>
<p>Even from the gallows did his fell 1190 soul fleet 1191 ,</p>
<p>And, whilst thou lay’st in thy unhallowed 1192 dam 1193 ,</p>
<p>Infused itself in thee, for thy desires</p>
<p>Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Till thou canst rail 1194 the seal from off my bond,</p>
<p>Thou but offend’st 1195 thy lungs to speak so loud:</p>
<p>Repair 1196 thy wit, good youth, or it will fall</p>
<p>To endless ruin. I stand here for law.</p>
<p>DUKE This letter from Bellario doth commend</p>
<p>A young and learnèd doctor in our court;</p>
<p>Where is he?</p>
<p>NERISSA He attendeth here hard 1197 by,</p>
<p>To know your answer, whether you’ll admit him.</p>
<p>DUKE With all my heart. Some three or four of you</p>
<p>Go give him courteous conduct to this place.</p>
<p>[Exeunt some ]</p>
<p>Meantime the court shall hear Bellario’s letter.</p>
<p>‘Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am
very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving
visitation 1198 was with me a young doctor of Rome. His name is
Balthasar. I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the
Jew and Antonio the merchant. We turned o’er many books together. He is
furnished 1199 with my opinion, which — bettered with his own learning,
the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend — comes with him, at my
importunity 1200 , to fill up your grace’s request in my stead. I
beseech you, let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a
reverend 1201 estimation, for I never knew so young a body with so old a
head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial 1202 shall
better publish 1203 his commendation 1204 .’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>Enter Portia for Balthasar</p>
<p>Dressed like a lawyer</p>
<p>You hear the learnèd Bellario, what he writes,</p>
<p>And here, I take it, is the doctor come.</p>
<p>Give me your hand. Came you from old Bellario?</p>
<p>PORTIA I did, my lord.</p>
<p>DUKE You are welcome. Take your place.</p>
<p>Are you acquainted with the difference 1205</p>
<p>That holds this present question 1206 in the court?</p>
<p>PORTIA I am informèd throughly 1207 of the cause.</p>
<p>Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?</p>
<p>DUKE Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.</p>
<p>PORTIA Is your name Shylock?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Shylock is my name.</p>
<p>PORTIA Of a strange nature is the suit you follow,</p>
<p>Yet in such rule 1208 that the Venetian law</p>
<p>Cannot impugn 1209 you as you do proceed.—</p>
<p>You stand within his danger 1210 , do you not?</p>
<p>ANTONIO Ay, so he says.</p>
<p>PORTIA Do you confess 1211 the bond?</p>
<p>ANTONIO I do.</p>
<p>PORTIA Then must the Jew be merciful.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.</p>
<p>PORTIA The quality of mercy is not strained 1212 ,</p>
<p>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</p>
<p>Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest 1213 :</p>
<p>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.</p>
<p>’Tis mightiest in the mightiest, it becomes</p>
<p>The thronèd monarch better than his crown.</p>
<p>His sceptre shows 1214 the force of temporal power,</p>
<p>The attribute to awe and majesty,</p>
<p>Wherein doth sit the dread 1215 and fear of kings.</p>
<p>But mercy is above this sceptred sway 1216 ,</p>
<p>It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings,</p>
<p>It is an attribute to God himself;</p>
<p>And earthly power doth then show likest 1217 God’s</p>
<p>When mercy seasons 1218 justice: therefore, Jew,</p>
<p>Though justice be thy plea, consider this,</p>
<p>That in the course of justice 1219 , none of us</p>
<p>Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,</p>
<p>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render 1220</p>
<p>The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much</p>
<p>To mitigate the justice of thy plea,</p>
<p>Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice</p>
<p>Must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant there.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK My deeds upon my head! 1221 I crave the law,</p>
<p>The penalty and forfeit of my bond.</p>
<p>PORTIA Is he not able to discharge 1222 the money?</p>
<p>BASSANIO Yes, here I tender 1223 it for him in the court,</p>
<p>Yea, twice the sum. If that will not suffice,</p>
<p>I will be bound to pay it ten times o’er</p>
<p>On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.</p>
<p>If this will not suffice, it must appear 1224</p>
<p>That malice bears down truth 1225 . And I beseech you</p>
<p>Wrest once 1226 the law to your authority.</p>
<p>To do a great right, do a little wrong,</p>
<p>And curb this cruel devil of his will.</p>
<p>PORTIA It must not be; there is no power in Venice</p>
<p>Can alter a decree establishèd.</p>
<p>’Twill be recorded for 1227 a precedent 1228 ,</p>
<p>And many an error by the same example</p>
<p>Will rush into the state. It cannot be.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK A Daniel 1229 come to judgement 1230 ! Yea, a Daniel!</p>
<p>O wise young judge, how do I honour thee!</p>
<p>PORTIA I pray you let me look upon the bond.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Here ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.</p>
<p>Gives Portia the bond</p>
<p>PORTIA Shylock, there’s thrice thy money offered thee.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven.</p>
<p>Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?</p>
<p>No, not for Venice.</p>
<p>PORTIA Why, this bond is forfeit,</p>
<p>And lawfully by this the Jew may claim</p>
<p>A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off</p>
<p>Nearest the merchant’s heart. Be merciful.</p>
<p>Take thrice thy money, bid me tear the bond.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK When it is paid according to the tenure 1231 .</p>
<p>It doth appear you are a worthy judge,</p>
<p>You know the law, your exposition</p>
<p>Hath been most sound. I charge you by the law,</p>
<p>Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,</p>
<p>Proceed to 1232 judgement. By my soul I swear,</p>
<p>There is no power in the tongue of man</p>
<p>To alter me. I stay here on my bond.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Most heartily I do beseech the court</p>
<p>To give the judgement.</p>
<p>PORTIA Why then, thus it is:</p>
<p>You must prepare your bosom for his knife.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK O noble judge! O excellent young man!</p>
<p>PORTIA For the intent and purpose of the law</p>
<p>Hath full relation to the penalty,</p>
<p>Which here appeareth due upon the bond.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK ’Tis very true. O wise and upright judge!</p>
<p>How much more elder art thou than thy looks!</p>
<p>PORTIA Therefore lay bare your bosom.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Ay, his breast,</p>
<p>So says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?</p>
<p>‘Nearest his heart’, those are the very words.</p>
<p>PORTIA It is so. Are there balance 1233 here to weigh</p>
<p>The flesh?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I have them ready.</p>
<p>PORTIA Have by 1234 some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge 1235 ,</p>
<p>To stop 1236 his wounds, lest he should bleed to death.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Is it so nominated in the bond?</p>
<p>PORTIA It is not so expressed, but what of that?</p>
<p>’Twere good you do so much for charity.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I cannot find it, ’tis not in the bond.</p>
<p>Looking at the bond</p>
<p>PORTIA Come, merchant, have you anything to say?</p>
<p>ANTONIO But little. I am armed 1237 and well prepared.</p>
<p>Give me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well.</p>
<p>Grieve not that I am fall’n to this for you,</p>
<p>For herein Fortune shows herself more kind</p>
<p>Than is her custom. It is still 1238 her use 1239</p>
<p>To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,</p>
<p>To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow</p>
<p>An age of poverty, from which ling’ring penance</p>
<p>Of such misery doth she cut me off.</p>
<p>Commend me to your honourable wife.</p>
<p>Tell her the process 1240 of Antonio’s end.</p>
<p>Say how I loved you; speak me fair in death 1241 .</p>
<p>And when the tale is told, bid her be judge</p>
<p>Whether Bassanio had not once a love 1242 .</p>
<p>Repent not you that you shall lose your friend,</p>
<p>And he repents not that he pays your debt.</p>
<p>For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,</p>
<p>I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart 1243 .</p>
<p>BASSANIO Antonio, I am married to a wife</p>
<p>Which 1244 is as dear to me as life itself,</p>
<p>But life itself, my wife, and all the world,</p>
<p>Are not with me esteemed above thy life.</p>
<p>I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all</p>
<p>Here to this devil, to deliver 1245 you.</p>
<p>PORTIA Your wife would give you little thanks for that,</p>
<p>If she were by to hear you make the offer.</p>
<p>GRATIANO I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love.</p>
<p>I would she were in heaven, so she could</p>
<p>Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.</p>
<p>NERISSA ’Tis well you offer it behind her back,</p>
<p>The wish would make else 1246 an unquiet house.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter.</p>
<p>Would 1247 any of the stock of Barabbas 1248</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>Had been her husband rather than a Christian!</p>
<p>We trifle 1249 time. I pray thee pursue 1250 sentence.</p>
<p>PORTIA A pound of that same merchant’s flesh is thine.</p>
<p>The court awards it, and the law doth give it.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Most rightful judge!</p>
<p>PORTIA And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.</p>
<p>The law allows it, and the court awards it.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Most learnèd judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!</p>
<p>PORTIA Tarry a little, there is something else.</p>
<p>This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood,</p>
<p>The words expressly are ‘a pound of flesh’.</p>
<p>Then take thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,</p>
<p>But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed</p>
<p>One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods</p>
<p>Are by the laws of Venice confiscate 1251</p>
<p>Unto the state of Venice.</p>
<p>GRATIANO O upright judge! Mark 1252 , Jew. O learnèd judge!</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Is that the law?</p>
<p>PORTIA Thyself shalt see the act,</p>
<p>For as thou urgest justice, be assured</p>
<p>Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.</p>
<p>GRATIANO O learnèd judge! Mark, Jew: a learnèd judge!</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I take this offer, then. Pay the bond thrice</p>
<p>And let the Christian go.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Here is the money.</p>
<p>PORTIA Soft! 1253</p>
<p>The Jew shall have all 1254 justice. Soft, no haste.</p>
<p>He shall have nothing but the penalty.</p>
<p>GRATIANO O Jew! An upright judge, a learnèd judge!</p>
<p>PORTIA Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.</p>
<p>Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more</p>
<p>But just a pound of flesh. If thou tak’st more</p>
<p>Or less than a just 1255 pound, be it so much</p>
<p>As makes it light or heavy in the substance 1256 ,</p>
<p>Or the division of the twentieth part</p>
<p>Of one poor scruple 1257 , nay, if the scale do turn</p>
<p>But in the estimation of a hair 1258 ,</p>
<p>Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.</p>
<p>GRATIANO A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!</p>
<p>Now, infidel, I have thee on the hip 1259 .</p>
<p>PORTIA Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Give me my principal 1260 , and let me go.</p>
<p>BASSANIO I have it ready for thee, here it is.</p>
<p>PORTIA He hath refused it in the open court.</p>
<p>He shall have merely 1261 justice and his bond.</p>
<p>GRATIANO A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!</p>
<p>I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Shall I not have barely 1262 my principal?</p>
<p>PORTIA Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,</p>
<p>To be taken so at thy peril, Jew.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Why, then the devil give him good 1263 of it!</p>
<p>I’ll stay 1264 no longer question 1265 .</p>
<p>Starts to go</p>
<p>PORTIA Tarry, Jew.</p>
<p>The law hath yet another hold on you.</p>
<p>It is enacted in the laws of Venice,</p>
<p>If it be proved against an alien 1266</p>
<p>That by direct or indirect attempts</p>
<p>He seek the life of any citizen,</p>
<p>The party gainst the which he doth contrive 1267</p>
<p>Shall seize 1268 one half his goods, the other half</p>
<p>Comes to the privy coffer 1269 of the state,</p>
<p>And the offender’s life lies in 1270 the mercy</p>
<p>Of the duke only, gainst all other voice 1271 .</p>
<p>In which predicament, I say, thou stand’st,</p>
<p>For it appears, by manifest proceeding 1272 ,</p>
<p>That indirectly, and directly too,</p>
<p>Thou hast contrived against the very life</p>
<p>Of the defendant, and thou hast incurred</p>
<p>The danger 1273 formerly by me rehearsed 1274 .</p>
<p>Down 1275 therefore, and beg mercy of the duke.</p>
<p>GRATIANO Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself,</p>
<p>And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,</p>
<p>Thou hast not left the value of a cord 1276 :</p>
<p>Therefore thou must be hanged at the state’s charge 1277 .</p>
<p>DUKE That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,</p>
<p>I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.</p>
<p>For 1278 half thy wealth, it is Antonio’s,</p>
<p>The other half comes to the general state,</p>
<p>Which humbleness 1279 may drive 1280 unto a fine.</p>
<p>PORTIA Ay, for the state, not for Antonio 1281 .</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Nay, take my life and all. Pardon not that.</p>
<p>You take my house when you do take the prop</p>
<p>That doth sustain my house. You take my life</p>
<p>When you do take the means whereby I live.</p>
<p>PORTIA What mercy can you render him, Antonio?</p>
<p>GRATIANO A halter 1282 gratis. Nothing else, for God’s sake.</p>
<p>ANTONIO So 1283 please my lord the duke and all the court</p>
<p>To quit 1284 the fine for one half of his goods,</p>
<p>I am content, so 1285 he will let me have</p>
<p>The other half in use 1286 , to render it,</p>
<p>Upon his death, unto the gentleman</p>
<p>That lately stole his daughter.</p>
<p>Two things provided more: that for this favour</p>
<p>He presently 1287 become a Christian.</p>
<p>The other, that he do record a gift</p>
<p>Here in the court of all he dies possessed 1288</p>
<p>Unto his son 1289 Lorenzo and his daughter.</p>
<p>DUKE He shall do this, or else I do recant</p>
<p>The pardon that I late 1290 pronouncèd here.</p>
<p>PORTIA Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I am content.</p>
<p>PORTIA Clerk, draw a deed of gift.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I pray you give me leave to go from hence,</p>
<p>I am not well. Send the deed after me,</p>
<p>And I will sign it.</p>
<p>DUKE Get thee gone, but do it.</p>
<p>GRATIANO In christening thou shalt have two godfathers.</p>
<p>Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more 1291 ,</p>
<p>To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font 1292 .</p>
<p>Exit [Shylock ]</p>
<p>DUKE Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.</p>
<p>To Portia</p>
<p>PORTIA I humbly do desire your grace of 1293 pardon.</p>
<p>I must away this night toward Padua,</p>
<p>And it is meet 1294 I presently set forth.</p>
<p>DUKE I am sorry that your leisure serves you not 1295 .</p>
<p>Antonio, gratify 1296 this gentleman,</p>
<p>For in my mind you are much bound to him.</p>
<p>Exit Duke and his train</p>
<p>BASSANIO Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend</p>
<p>Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted</p>
<p>Of grievous penalties, in lieu whereof 1297 ,</p>
<p>Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew</p>
<p>We freely cope 1298 your courteous pains withal.</p>
<p>Offers money</p>
<p>ANTONIO And stand indebted, over and above,</p>
<p>In love and service to you evermore.</p>
<p>PORTIA He is well paid that is well satisfied,</p>
<p>And I, delivering you, am satisfied</p>
<p>And therein do account 1299 myself well paid.</p>
<p>My mind was never yet more mercenary.</p>
<p>I pray you know 1300 me when we meet again.</p>
<p>I wish you well, and so I take my leave.</p>
<p>Starts to leave</p>
<p>BASSANIO Dear sir, of force I must attempt 1301 you further.</p>
<p>Take some remembrance of us as a tribute,</p>
<p>Not as fee. Grant me two things, I pray you:</p>
<p>Not to deny me, and to pardon me 1302 .</p>
<p>PORTIA You press 1303 me far, and therefore I will yield 1304 .</p>
<p>Give me your gloves, I’ll wear them for your sake.</p>
<p>To Antonio</p>
<p>And, for your love 1305 , I’ll take this ring from you.</p>
<p>To Bassanio</p>
<p>Do not draw back your hand, I’ll take no more,</p>
<p>And you in 1306 love shall not deny me this.</p>
<p>BASSANIO This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!</p>
<p>I will not shame myself to give you this.</p>
<p>PORTIA I will have nothing else but only this,</p>
<p>And now methinks I have a mind to 1307 it.</p>
<p>BASSANIO There’s more depends on this than on the value.</p>
<p>The dearest 1308 ring in Venice will I give you,</p>
<p>And find it out by proclamation.</p>
<p>Only for this, I pray you pardon me.</p>
<p>PORTIA I see, sir, you are liberal 1309 in offers.</p>
<p>You taught me first to beg, and now methinks</p>
<p>You teach me how a beggar should be answered.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife,</p>
<p>And when she put it on, she made me vow</p>
<p>That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.</p>
<p>PORTIA That ’scuse serves many men to save their gifts.</p>
<p>An if your wife be not a madwoman,</p>
<p>And know how well I have deserved this ring,</p>
<p>She would not hold out enemy forever</p>
<p>For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!</p>
<p>Exeunt [Portia and Nerissa ]</p>
<p>ANTONIO My lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.</p>
<p>Let his deservings and my love withal</p>
<p>Be valued against your wife’s commandment.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him.</p>
<p>Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,</p>
<p>Unto Antonio’s house. Away, make haste!</p>
<p>Exit Gratiano</p>
<p>Come, you and I will thither presently,</p>
<p>And in the morning early will we both</p>
<p>Fly 1310 toward Belmont. Come, Antonio.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
