<h4 id="scene-4-154-running-scene-2">Scene 4 154 / running scene 2</h4>
<p>Enter Philario 155 , Iachimo 156 , a Frenchman, a Dutchman and a
Spaniard</p>
<p>IACHIMO Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain; he was then of a
crescent note 157 , expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been
allowed the name of 158 . But I could then have looked on him without
the help of admiration 159 , though the catalogue of his endowments 160
had been tabled 161 by his side and I to peruse him by items.</p>
<p>PHILARIO You speak of him when he was less furnished than now he is
with that which makes him both without and within.</p>
<p>FRENCHMAN I have seen him in France: we had very many there could
behold the sun with as firm eyes as he 162 .</p>
<p>IACHIMO This matter of marrying his king’s daughter, wherein he must
be weighed 163 rather by her value than his own, words him, I doubt not,
a great deal from the matter 164 .</p>
<p>FRENCHMAN And then his banishment.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Ay, and the approbation 165 of those that weep this
lamentable divorce 166 under her 167 colours are wonderfully to extend
him, be it but 168 to fortify 169 her judgement, which else an easy
battery 170 might lay flat, for taking a beggar without less quality.
But how comes it he is to sojourn 171 with you? How creeps acquaintance
172 ?</p>
<p>PHILARIO His father and I were soldiers together, to whom I have been
often bound for no less than my life.</p>
<p>Enter Posthumus</p>
<p>Here comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained amongst you as suits
173 with gentlemen of your knowing 174 to a stranger of his quality. I
beseech you all be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend to you
as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he is I will leave to appear
hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing 175 .</p>
<p>FRENCHMAN Sir, we have known together 176 in Orleans.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies, which
I will be ever to pay, and yet pay still 177 .</p>
<p>FRENCHMAN Sir, you o’errate my poor kindness, I was glad I did atone
178 my countryman and you: it had been pity you should have been put
together 179 , with so mortal 180 a purpose as then each bore, upon
importance of so slight and trivial a nature.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller, rather
shunned to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be
guided by others’ experiences 181 : but upon my mended judgement — if I
offend not to say it is mended — my quarrel was not altogether
slight.</p>
<p>FRENCHMAN Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrament of 182 swords, and
by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other,
or have fallen both.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?</p>
<p>FRENCHMAN Safely, I think: ’twas a contention in public, which may,
without contradiction, suffer the report 183 . It was much like an
argument that fell out 184 last night, where each of us fell in praise
of our country mistresses 185 . This gentleman at that time vouching 186
— and upon warrant of bloody affirmation — his to be more fair,
virtuous, wise, chaste, constant, qualified and less attemptable 187
than any the rarest of our ladies in France.</p>
<p>IACHIMO That lady is not now living; or this gentleman’s opinion, by
this, worn out 188 .</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS She holds 189 her virtue still, and I my mind 190 .</p>
<p>IACHIMO You must not so far prefer her ’fore ours of Italy.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would abate her
nothing 191 , though I profess myself 192 her adorer, not her
friend.</p>
<p>IACHIMO As fair and as good — a kind of hand-in-hand comparison 193 —
had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain. If she
went before 194 others I have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres
many I have beheld, I could not but believe she excelled many: but I
have not seen the most precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS I praised her as I rated 195 her: so do I my stone.</p>
<p>IACHIMO What do you esteem 196 it at?</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS More than the world enjoys 197 .</p>
<p>IACHIMO Either your unparagoned 198 mistress is dead, or she’s
outprized by a trifle 199 .</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS You are mistaken: the one may be sold or 200 given, or if
there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit for the gift. The
other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Which the gods have given you?</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Which by their graces I will keep.</p>
<p>IACHIMO You may wear her in title yours 201 : but you know strange
fowl light upon neighbouring ponds 202 . Your ring 203 may be stolen
too, so your brace 204 of unprizable estimations 205 , the one is but
frail 206 and the other casual 207 . A cunning thief, or a
that-way-accomplished courtier 208 , would hazard the winning both of
first and last.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier to
convince 209 the honour of my mistress, if in the holding or loss of
that you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store 210 of
thieves, notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.</p>
<p>PHILARIO Let us leave here 211 , gentlemen.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank him,
makes no stranger of me, we are familiar at first 212 .</p>
<p>IACHIMO With five times so much conversation, I should get ground of
your fair mistress, make her go back, even to the yielding 213 , had I
admittance and opportunity to friend 214 .</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS No, no.</p>
<p>IACHIMO I dare thereupon pawn the moiety 215 of my estate, to 216
your ring, which in my opinion o’ervalues it something 217 : but I make
my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation. And to bar
your offence 218 herein too, I durst attempt it against any lady in the
world.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS You are a great deal abused 219 in too bold a persuasion
220 , and I doubt not you sustain what you’re worthy of 221 by your
attempt.</p>
<p>IACHIMO What’s that?</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS A repulse, though your attempt, as you call it, deserve
more: a punishment too.</p>
<p>PHILARIO Gentlemen, enough of this, it came in 222 too suddenly. Let
it die as it was born, and I pray you be better acquainted.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Would I had put my estate 223 and my neighbour’s on
th’approbation 224 of what I have spoke.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS What lady would you choose to assail?</p>
<p>IACHIMO Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will lay
you ten thousand ducats 225 to your ring, that commend 226 me to the
court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity of
a second conference 227 , and I will bring from thence that honour of
hers which you imagine so reserved 228 .</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS I will wage 229 against your gold, gold to it: my ring I
hold dear as my finger,’tis part of it.</p>
<p>IACHIMO You are a friend, and therein the wiser 230 : if you buy
ladies’ flesh at a million a dram 231 , you cannot preserve 232 it from
tainting. But 233 I see you have some religion in you, that 234 you
fear.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS This is but a custom in your tongue 235 : you bear a graver
236 purpose I hope.</p>
<p>IACHIMO I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo 237 what’s
spoken, I swear.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your return: let
there be covenants drawn between’s 238 . My mistress exceeds in goodness
the hugeness of</p>
<p>your unworthy thinking. I dare you to this match: here’s my ring.</p>
<p>PHILARIO I will have it no lay 239 .</p>
<p>IACHIMO By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient
testimony 240 that I have enjoyed the dearest bodily part of your
mistress, my ten thousand ducats are yours, so is your diamond too. If I
come off 241 , and leave her in such honour as you have trust in, she
your jewel, this your jewel and my gold are yours, provided I have your
commendation 242 for my more free entertainment 243 .</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS I embrace these conditions, let us have articles betwixt us
244 . Only thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon her
245 and give me directly to understand you have prevailed, I am no
further your enemy, she is not worth our debate. If she remain
unseduced, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill opinion and
th’assault you have made to her chastity, you shall answer me with your
sword.</p>
<p>IACHIMO Your hand, a covenant 246 : we will have these things set
down by lawful counsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the bargain
should catch cold and starve 247 : I will fetch my gold and have our two
wagers recorded.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Agreed.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Posthumus and Iachimo]</p>
<p>FRENCHMAN Will this hold 248 , think you?</p>
<p>PHILARIO Signior Iachimo will not from it 249 . Pray let us follow
’em.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
