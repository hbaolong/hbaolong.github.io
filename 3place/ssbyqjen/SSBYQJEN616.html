<h4 id="scene-1-1-running-scene-1">Scene 1 1 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter two Gentlemen</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN You do not meet a man but frowns 2 . Our bloods 3</p>
<p>No more obey the heavens than our courtiers</p>
<p>Still seem as does the king 4 .</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN But what’s the matter?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN His daughter, and the heir of’s kingdom, whom</p>
<p>He purposed to 5 his wife’s sole son — a widow</p>
<p>That late 6 he married — hath referred herself</p>
<p>Unto 7 a poor but worthy gentleman. She’s wedded,</p>
<p>Her husband banished, she imprisoned, all</p>
<p>Is outward sorrow, though I think the king</p>
<p>Be touched at very heart 8 .</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN None but the king?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN He that hath lost her 9 too: so is the queen,</p>
<p>That most desired the match. But not a courtier,</p>
<p>Although they wear their faces to the bent 10</p>
<p>Of the king’s looks, hath a heart that is not</p>
<p>Glad at the thing they scowl at.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN And why so?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN He that hath missed 11 the princess is a thing 12</p>
<p>Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her —</p>
<p>I mean, that married her, alack, good man,</p>
<p>And therefore banished — is a creature 13 such</p>
<p>As, to seek through the regions of the earth</p>
<p>For one his like 14 , there would be something failing 15</p>
<p>In him that should compare. I do not think</p>
<p>So fair an outward 16 and such stuff 17 within</p>
<p>Endows a man but he 18 .</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN You speak him far 19 .</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN I do extend, sir, within himself 20 ,</p>
<p>Crush him together rather than unfold</p>
<p>His measure 21 duly.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN What’s his name and birth 22 ?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN I cannot delve him to the root 23 : his father</p>
<p>Was called Sicilius, who did join his honour 24</p>
<p>Against the Romans with Cassibelan 25 ,</p>
<p>But had his titles by 26 Tenantius 27 whom</p>
<p>He served with glory and admired success:</p>
<p>So gained the sur-addition 28 Leonatus 29 .</p>
<p>And had, besides this gentleman in question,</p>
<p>Two other sons, who in the wars o’th’time</p>
<p>Died with their swords in hand. For which their father,</p>
<p>Then old and fond of issue 30 , took such sorrow</p>
<p>That he quit being, and his gentle lady,</p>
<p>Big of 31 this gentleman, our theme, deceased</p>
<p>As he was born. The king he takes the babe</p>
<p>To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,</p>
<p>Breeds him, and makes him of his bedchamber 32 ,</p>
<p>Puts to him all the learnings 33 that his time 34</p>
<p>Could make him the receiver of, which he took</p>
<p>As we do air, fast 35 as ’twas ministered,</p>
<p>And in’s spring became a harvest 36 : lived in court —</p>
<p>Which rare 37 it is to do — most praised, most loved:</p>
<p>A sample 38 to the youngest, to th’more mature</p>
<p>A glass 39 that feated them 40 , and to the graver 41 ,</p>
<p>A child that guided dotards 42 . To his mistress,</p>
<p>For whom he now is banished, her own price 43</p>
<p>Proclaims 44 how 45 she esteemed him; and his virtue</p>
<p>By her election may be truly read 46 ,</p>
<p>What kind of man he is.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN I honour him even 47 out of your report.</p>
<p>But pray you tell me, is she sole child to th’king?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN His only child.</p>
<p>He had two sons — if this be worth your hearing,</p>
<p>Mark it — the eldest of them at three years old,</p>
<p>I’th’swathing 48 clothes the other, from their nursery</p>
<p>Were stol’n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge Which way they
went.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN How long is this ago?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Some twenty years.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN That a king’s children should be so conveyed 49
,</p>
<p>So slackly 50 guarded, and the search so slow</p>
<p>That could not trace them.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Howsoe’er ’tis strange 51 ,</p>
<p>Or that the negligence may well be laughed at,</p>
<p>Yet is it true, sir.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN I do well believe you.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN We must forbear 52 . Here comes the gentleman,</p>
<p>The queen and princess.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Enter the Queen, Posthumus 53 and Innogen 54</p>
<p>QUEEN No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,</p>
<p>After the slander 55 of most stepmothers,</p>
<p>Evil-eyed unto you. You’re my prisoner, but</p>
<p>Your jailer shall deliver you the keys</p>
<p>That lock up your restraint 56 . For you, Posthumus,</p>
<p>So soon as I can win 57 th’offended king,</p>
<p>I will be known your advocate: marry 58 , yet</p>
<p>The fire of rage is in him, and ’twere good</p>
<p>You leaned unto 59 his sentence, with what patience</p>
<p>Your wisdom may inform you 60 .</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Please 61 your highness,</p>
<p>I will from hence 62 today.</p>
<p>QUEEN You know the peril 63 .</p>
<p>I’ll fetch a 64 turn about the garden, pitying 65</p>
<p>The pangs of barred affections 66 , though the king</p>
<p>Hath charged 67 you should not speak together.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>INNOGEN O dissembling 68 courtesy! How fine this tyrant</p>
<p>Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,</p>
<p>I something fear my father’s wrath, but nothing —</p>
<p>Always reserved my holy duty 69 — what</p>
<p>His rage can do on me. You must be gone,</p>
<p>And I shall here abide the hourly shot 70</p>
<p>Of angry eyes: not comforted to live,</p>
<p>But that there is this jewel in the world</p>
<p>That I may see again.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS My queen, my mistress:</p>
<p>O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause</p>
<p>To be suspected of more tenderness</p>
<p>Than doth become a man 71 . I will remain</p>
<p>The loyal’st husband that did e’er plight troth 72 .</p>
<p>My residence in Rome, at one Philario’s,</p>
<p>Who to my father was a friend, to me</p>
<p>Known but by letter: thither 73 write, my queen,</p>
<p>And with mine eyes I’ll drink the words you send,</p>
<p>Though ink be made of gall 74 .</p>
<p>Enter Queen</p>
<p>QUEEN Be brief, I pray you:</p>
<p>If the king come, I shall incur I know not</p>
<p>How much of his displeasure.— Yet I’ll move him</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>To walk this way: I never do him wrong,</p>
<p>But he does buy 75 my injuries to be friends:</p>
<p>Pays dear for my offences.</p>
<p>[Exit]</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Should we be taking leave</p>
<p>As long a term 76 as yet we have to live,</p>
<p>The loathness 77 to depart would grow. Adieu.</p>
<p>INNOGEN Nay, stay a little:</p>
<p>Were you but riding forth to air yourself,</p>
<p>Such parting were too petty 78 . Look here, love,</p>
<p>This diamond was my mother’s; take it, heart,</p>
<p>Gives a ring</p>
<p>But keep it till you woo another wife,</p>
<p>When Innogen is dead.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS How, how? Another?</p>
<p>You gentle gods, give me but this I have,</p>
<p>And cere 79 up my embracements from a next</p>
<p>With bonds of death. Remain, remain thou here</p>
<p>Puts on the ring</p>
<p>While sense 80 can keep it on: and sweetest, fairest,</p>
<p>As I my poor self did exchange for you 81</p>
<p>To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles 82</p>
<p>I still win of you. For my sake wear this,</p>
<p>It is a manacle of love. I’ll place it</p>
<p>Upon this fairest prisoner 83 .</p>
<p>Puts a bracelet on her arm</p>
<p>INNOGEN O, the gods!</p>
<p>When shall we see 84 again?</p>
<p>Enter Cymbeline and Lords</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Alack 85 , the king!</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Thou basest 86 thing, avoid hence 87 , from my sight:</p>
<p>If after this command thou fraught 88 the court</p>
<p>With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away,</p>
<p>Thou’rt poison to my blood.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS The gods protect you,</p>
<p>And bless the good remainders 89 of the court:</p>
<p>I am gone.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>INNOGEN There cannot be a pinch 90 in death</p>
<p>More sharp than this is.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE O disloyal thing,</p>
<p>That shouldst repair 91 my youth, thou heap’st</p>
<p>A year’s age on me.</p>
<p>INNOGEN I beseech you, sir,</p>
<p>Harm not yourself with your vexation,</p>
<p>I am senseless of 92 your wrath; a touch more rare 93</p>
<p>Subdues all pangs, all fears.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Past grace? Obedience?</p>
<p>INNOGEN Past hope and in despair: that way past grace 94 .</p>
<p>CYMBELINE That mightst have had the sole son of my queen.</p>
<p>INNOGEN O, blest that I might not: I chose an eagle,</p>
<p>And did avoid a puttock 95 .</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Thou took’st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne</p>
<p>A seat for baseness.</p>
<p>INNOGEN No, I rather added a lustre to it.</p>
<p>CYMBELINE O thou vile one!</p>
<p>INNOGEN Sir,</p>
<p>It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:</p>
<p>You bred him as my playfellow, and he is</p>
<p>A man worth any woman: overbuys me</p>
<p>Almost the sum he pays 96 .</p>
<p>CYMBELINE What? Art thou mad?</p>
<p>INNOGEN Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were</p>
<p>A neatherd’s 97 daughter, and my Leonatus</p>
<p>Our neighbour shepherd’s son.</p>
<p>Enter Queen</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Thou foolish thing!—</p>
<p>They were again together: you have done</p>
<p>To Queen</p>
<p>Not after 98 our command.— Away with her,</p>
<p>And pen her up.</p>
<p>QUEEN Beseech 99 your patience: peace,</p>
<p>Dear lady daughter, peace. Sweet sovereign,</p>
<p>Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort</p>
<p>Out of your best advice 100 .</p>
<p>CYMBELINE Nay, let her languish 101</p>
<p>A drop of blood a day, and being aged,</p>
<p>Die of this folly.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Cymbeline and Lords]</p>
<p>Enter Pisanio</p>
<p>QUEEN Fie, you must give way 102 .</p>
<p>Here is your servant.— How now, sir? What news?</p>
<p>PISANIO My lord your son drew 103 on my master.0</p>
<p>QUEEN Ha?</p>
<p>No harm I trust is done?</p>
<p>PISANIO There might have been,</p>
<p>But that my master rather played than fought,</p>
<p>And had no help of anger 104 : they were parted</p>
<p>By gentlemen at hand.</p>
<p>QUEEN I am very glad on’t.</p>
<p>INNOGEN Your son’s my father’s friend, he takes his part 105</p>
<p>To draw upon an exile.— O brave sir!—</p>
<p>I would they were in Afric 106 both together,</p>
<p>Myself by with a needle, that I might prick</p>
<p>The goer-back 107 .—Why came you from your master?</p>
<p>PISANIO On his command: he would not suffer 108 me</p>
<p>To bring him to the haven 109 : left these notes</p>
<p>Of what commands I should be subject to,</p>
<p>When’t pleased you to employ me.</p>
<p>QUEEN This hath been</p>
<p>Your faithful servant: I dare lay 110 mine honour</p>
<p>He will remain so.</p>
<p>PISANIO I humbly thank your highness.</p>
<p>QUEEN Pray walk awhile.</p>
<p>To Innogen</p>
<p>INNOGEN About some half hour hence, pray you speak with me.</p>
<p>To Pisanio</p>
<p>You shall, at least, go see my lord aboard.</p>
<p>For this time leave me.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
