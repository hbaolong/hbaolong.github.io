scene 6 continues</h4>
<p>Enter Palamon, and Arcite in prison</p>
<p>Above</p>
<p>PALAMON How do you, noble cousin?</p>
<p>ARCITE How do you, sir?</p>
<p>PALAMON Why, strong enough to laugh at misery And bear the chance 364
of war: yet we are prisoners, I fear, for ever, cousin.</p>
<p>ARCITE I believe it,</p>
<p>And to that destiny have patiently</p>
<p>Laid up my hour to come 365 .</p>
<p>PALAMON O cousin Arcite,</p>
<p>Where is Thebes now? Where is our noble country?</p>
<p>Where are our friends and kindreds 366 ? Never more</p>
<p>Must we behold those comforts, never see</p>
<p>The hardy 367 youths strive for the games of honour,</p>
<p>Hung with the painted favours 368 of their ladies,</p>
<p>Like tall ships under sail: then start 369 amongst ’em</p>
<p>And as an east wind leave ’em all behind us,</p>
<p>Like lazy clouds, whilst Palamon and Arcite</p>
<p>Even in the wagging 370 of a wanton 371 leg</p>
<p>Outstripped 372 the people’s praises, won the garlands,</p>
<p>Ere they have time to wish ’em ours. O, never</p>
<p>Shall we two exercise, like twins 373 of honour,</p>
<p>Our arms again and feel our fiery horses</p>
<p>Like proud seas under us. Our good swords now—</p>
<p>Better the red-eyed god of war 374 ne’er wore—</p>
<p>Ravished 375 our sides, like age must run to rust</p>
<p>And deck the temples of those gods that hate us.</p>
<p>These hands shall never draw ’em out like lightning</p>
<p>To blast 376 whole armies more.</p>
<p>ARCITE No, Palamon,</p>
<p>Those hopes are prisoners with us. Here we are,</p>
<p>And here the graces of our youths must wither</p>
<p>Like a too-timely 377 spring: here age must find us,</p>
<p>And, which is heaviest 378 , Palamon, unmarried.</p>
<p>The sweet embraces of a loving wife,</p>
<p>Loaden with kisses, armed with thousand Cupids 379 380 ,</p>
<p>Shall never clasp our necks. No issue 381 know us,</p>
<p>No figures 382 of ourselves shall we ev’r see,</p>
<p>To glad 383 our age, and like young eagles teach ’em</p>
<p>Boldly to gaze against bright arms 384 and say,</p>
<p>‘Remember what your fathers were, and conquer!’</p>
<p>The fair-eyed maids shall weep our banishments</p>
<p>And in their songs curse ever-blinded Fortune 385</p>
<p>Till she for shame see what a wrong she has done</p>
<p>To youth and nature. This is all our world:</p>
<p>We shall know nothing here but one another,</p>
<p>Hear nothing but the clock that tells 386 our woes.</p>
<p>The vine shall grow but we shall never see it:</p>
<p>Summer shall come and with her all delights,</p>
<p>But dead-cold winter must inhabit here still.</p>
<p>PALAMON ’Tis too true, Arcite. To our Theban hounds</p>
<p>That shook the agèd forest with their echoes</p>
<p>No more now must we hallow 387 , no more shake</p>
<p>Our pointed javelins whilst the angry swine 388</p>
<p>Flies like a Parthian 389 quiver from our rages,</p>
<p>Struck with our well-steeled 390 darts. All valiant uses 391 ,</p>
<p>The food and nourishment of noble minds,</p>
<p>In us two here shall perish: we shall die,</p>
<p>Which is the curse of honour, lastly 392 ,</p>
<p>Children of grief and ignorance.</p>
<p>ARCITE Yet, cousin,</p>
<p>Even from the bottom of these miseries,</p>
<p>From all that Fortune can inflict upon us,</p>
<p>I see two comforts rising, two mere 393 blessings,</p>
<p>If the gods please: to hold 394 here a brave patience</p>
<p>And the enjoying 395 of our griefs together.</p>
<p>Whilst Palamon is with me, let me perish</p>
<p>If I think this our prison.</p>
<p>PALAMON Certainly,</p>
<p>’Tis a main 396 goodness, cousin, that our fortunes</p>
<p>Were twined together: ’tis most true, two souls</p>
<p>Put in two noble bodies, let ’em suffer</p>
<p>The gall of hazard 397 , so they grow together,</p>
<p>Will never sink 398 : they must not, say 399 they could.</p>
<p>A willing 400 man dies sleeping 401 and all’s done.</p>
<p>ARCITE Shall we make worthy uses of this place</p>
<p>That all men hate so much?</p>
<p>PALAMON How, gentle cousin?</p>
<p>ARCITE Let’s think this prison holy sanctuary,</p>
<p>To keep us from corruption of worse men.</p>
<p>We are young and yet 402 desire the ways of honour,</p>
<p>That liberty and common 403 conversation,</p>
<p>The poison of pure spirits, might, like women,</p>
<p>Woo 404 us to wander from. What worthy blessing</p>
<p>Can be but our imaginations</p>
<p>May make it ours? And here being thus together,</p>
<p>We are an endless mine 405 to one another:</p>
<p>We are one another’s wife, ever begetting 406</p>
<p>New births of love: we are father, friends, acquaintance,</p>
<p>We are, in one another, families:</p>
<p>I am your heir and you are mine: this place</p>
<p>Is our inheritance. No hard oppressor</p>
<p>Dare take this from us: here with a little patience</p>
<p>We shall live long and loving. No surfeits 407 seek us:</p>
<p>The hand of war hurts none here, nor the seas</p>
<p>Swallow their youth. Were we at liberty,</p>
<p>A wife might part us lawfully, or business,</p>
<p>Quarrels consume 408 us, envy of ill men</p>
<p>Crave our acquaintance. I might sicken, cousin,</p>
<p>Where you should never know it, and so perish</p>
<p>Without your noble hand to close mine eyes,</p>
<p>Or prayers to the gods. A thousand chances,</p>
<p>Were we from hence, would sever us.</p>
<p>PALAMON You have made me —</p>
<p>I thank you cousin Arcite — almost wanton 409</p>
<p>With my captivity: what a misery</p>
<p>It is to live abroad 410 and everywhere!</p>
<p>’Tis like a beast, methinks. I find the court here,</p>
<p>I am sure, a more 411 content, and all those pleasures</p>
<p>That woo the wills of men to vanity</p>
<p>I see through now, and am sufficient 412</p>
<p>To tell the world ’tis but a gaudy 413 shadow 414</p>
<p>That old Time as he passes by takes with him.</p>
<p>What had we been, old 415 in the court of Creon,</p>
<p>Where sin is justice, lust and ignorance</p>
<p>The virtues of the great ones? Cousin Arcite,</p>
<p>Had not the loving gods found this place for us,</p>
<p>We had died as they do, ill 416 old men, unwept,</p>
<p>And had their epitaphs, the people’s curses.</p>
<p>Shall I say more?</p>
<p>ARCITE I would hear you still 417 .</p>
<p>PALAMON Ye shall.</p>
<p>Is there record of any two that loved</p>
<p>Better than we do, Arcite?</p>
<p>ARCITE Sure there cannot.</p>
<p>PALAMON I do not think it possible our friendship</p>
<p>Should ever leave us.</p>
<p>ARCITE Till our deaths it cannot.</p>
<p>Enter Emilia and her Woman</p>
<p>Below</p>
<p>And after death our spirits shall be led</p>
<p>To those that love eternally.</p>
<p>Speak on, sir.</p>
<p>Palamon sees Emilia</p>
<p>EMILIA This garden has a world of pleasures in’t.</p>
<p>To her Woman</p>
<p>What flower is this?</p>
<p>WOMAN ’Tis called narcissus 418 , madam.</p>
<p>EMILIA That was a fair boy, certain, but a fool</p>
<p>To love himself. Were there not maids enough?</p>
<p>ARCITE Pray forward 419 .</p>
<p>To Palamon</p>
<p>PALAMON Yes.</p>
<p>EMILIA Or were they all hard-hearted?</p>
<p>WOMAN They could not be to one so fair.</p>
<p>EMILIA Thou wouldst not 420 .</p>
<p>WOMAN I think I should not, madam.</p>
<p>EMILIA That’s a good wench 421 :</p>
<p>But take heed to 422 your kindness though.</p>
<p>WOMAN Why, mad 423 am?</p>
<p>EMILIA Men are mad things.</p>
<p>ARCITE Will ye go forward 424 , cousin?</p>
<p>EMILIA Canst not thou work 425 such flowers in silk, wench?</p>
<p>WOMAN Yes.</p>
<p>EMILIA I’ll have a gown full of ’em, and of these.</p>
<p>This is a pretty colour, will’t not do</p>
<p>Rarely 426 upon a skirt, wench?</p>
<p>WOMAN Dainty 427 , madam.</p>
<p>ARCITE Cousin, cousin, how do you, sir? Why, Palamon?</p>
<p>PALAMON Never till now I was in prison, Arcite.</p>
<p>ARCITE Why, what’s the matter, man?</p>
<p>PALAMON Behold, and wonder.</p>
<p>Indicates Emilia</p>
<p>By heaven, she is a goddess.</p>
<p>ARCITE Ha!</p>
<p>Sees Emilia</p>
<p>PALAMON Do reverence:</p>
<p>She is a goddess, Arcite.</p>
<p>EMILIA Of all flowers</p>
<p>Methinks a rose is best.</p>
<p>WOMAN Why, gentle madam?</p>
<p>EMILIA It is the very emblem 428 of a maid.</p>
<p>For when the west wind courts her gently,</p>
<p>How modestly she blows 429 and paints the sun 430</p>
<p>With her chaste blushes. When the north 431 comes near her,</p>
<p>Rude 432 and impatient, then, like chastity,</p>
<p>She locks her beauties in her bud again,</p>
<p>And leaves him to base 433 briars 434 .</p>
<p>WOMAN Yet, good madam,</p>
<p>Sometimes her modesty will blow so far</p>
<p>She falls 435 for’t 436 : a maid,</p>
<p>If she have any honour, would be loath</p>
<p>To take example by her.</p>
<p>EMILIA Thou art wanton 437 .</p>
<p>ARCITE She is wondrous fair.</p>
<p>PALAMON She is all the beauty extant 438 .</p>
<p>EMILIA The sun grows high, let’s walk in. Keep these flowers:</p>
<p>We’ll see how near art 439 can come near their colours.</p>
<p>I am wondrous merry-hearted, I could laugh now.</p>
<p>WOMAN I could lie down 440 , I am sure.</p>
<p>EMILIA And take one 441 with you?</p>
<p>WOMAN That’s as we bargain 442 , madam,</p>
<p>EMILIA Well, agree then.</p>
<p>Exeunt Emilia and Woman</p>
<p>PALAMON What think you of this beauty?</p>
<p>ARCITE ’Tis a rare one.</p>
<p>PALAMON Is’t but 443 a rare one?</p>
<p>ARCITE Yes, a matchless beauty,</p>
<p>PALAMON Might not a man well lose himself and love her?</p>
<p>ARCITE I cannot tell what you have done. I have,</p>
<p>Beshrew 444 mine eyes for’t: now I feel my shackles.</p>
<p>PALAMON You love her then?</p>
<p>ARCITE Who would not?</p>
<p>PALAMON And desire her?</p>
<p>ARCITE Before my liberty.</p>
<p>PALAMON I saw her first.</p>
<p>ARCITE That’s nothing.</p>
<p>PALAMON But it shall be.</p>
<p>ARCITE I saw her too.</p>
<p>PALAMON Yes, but you must not love her.</p>
<p>ARCITE I will not as you do, to worship her</p>
<p>As she is heavenly and a blessèd goddess.</p>
<p>I love her as a woman, to enjoy 445 her:</p>
<p>So both may love.</p>
<p>PALAMON You shall not love at all.</p>
<p>ARCITE Not love at all?</p>
<p>Who shall deny 446 me?</p>
<p>PALAMON I that first saw her, I that took possession</p>
<p>First with mine eye of all those beauties</p>
<p>In her revealed to mankind. If thou lov’st her,</p>
<p>Or entertain’st a hope to blast 447 my wishes,</p>
<p>Thou art a traitor, Arcite, and a fellow 448</p>
<p>False as thy title 449 to her: friendship, blood 450</p>
<p>And all the ties between us I disclaim</p>
<p>If thou once think upon 451 her.</p>
<p>ARCITE Yes, I love her</p>
<p>And if the lives of all my name 452 lay 453 on it,</p>
<p>I must do so. I love her with my soul:</p>
<p>If that will lose ye, farewell, Palamon.</p>
<p>I say again, I love, and in loving her maintain</p>
<p>I am as worthy and as free 454 a lover,</p>
<p>And have as just a title to her beauty,</p>
<p>As any Palamon or any living</p>
<p>That is a man’s son.</p>
<p>PALAMON Have I called thee friend?</p>
<p>ARCITE Yes, and have found me so: why are you moved 455 thus?</p>
<p>Let me deal coldly 456 with you: am not I</p>
<p>Part of your blood, part of your soul? You have told me</p>
<p>That I was Palamon and you were Arcite</p>
<p>PALAMON Yes.</p>
<p>ARCITE Am not I liable to those affections 457 ,</p>
<p>Those joys, griefs, angers, fears, my friend shall suffer?</p>
<p>PALAMON Ye may be.</p>
<p>ARCITE Why then would you deal so cunningly 458 ,</p>
<p>So strangely 459 , so unlike a noble kinsman,</p>
<p>To love alone? Speak truly: do you think me</p>
<p>Unworthy of her sight?</p>
<p>PALAMON No, but unjust 460</p>
<p>If thou pursue that sight.</p>
<p>ARCITE Because another</p>
<p>First sees the enemy, shall I stand still</p>
<p>And let mine honour down 461 , and never charge?</p>
<p>PALAMON Yes, if he be but one.</p>
<p>ARCITE But say that one</p>
<p>Had rather combat me?</p>
<p>PALAMON Let that one say so,</p>
<p>And use thy freedom: else if thou pursuest her,</p>
<p>Be as that cursèd man that hates his country,</p>
<p>A branded 462 villain.</p>
<p>ARCITE You are mad.</p>
<p>PALAMON I must be</p>
<p>Till thou art worthy 463 , Arcite: it concerns me.</p>
<p>And in this madness, if I hazard 464 thee</p>
<p>And take thy life, I deal but truly.</p>
<p>ARCITE Fie 465 , sir.</p>
<p>You play the child 466 extremely. I will love her:</p>
<p>I must, I ought to do so, and I dare,</p>
<p>And all this justly 467 .</p>
<p>PALAMON O that now, that now</p>
<p>Thy false self and thy friend had but this fortune:</p>
<p>To be one hour at liberty and grasp</p>
<p>Our good swords in our hands! I would quickly teach thee</p>
<p>What ’twere to filch 468 affection from another.</p>
<p>Thou art baser 469 in it than a cutpurse 470 ;</p>
<p>Put but thy head out of this window more 471 ,</p>
<p>And as I have a soul, I’ll nail thy life to’t 472 .</p>
<p>ARCITE Thou dar’st not, fool, thou canst not, thou art feeble.</p>
<p>Put my head out? I’ll throw my body out</p>
<p>And leap the garden, when I see her next,</p>
<p>Enter Keeper [ Jailer ]</p>
<p>And pitch 473 between her arms to anger thee.</p>
<p>PALAMON No more: the keeper’s coming. I shall live</p>
<p>To knock thy brains out with my shackles.</p>
<p>ARCITE Do!</p>
<p>JAILER By your leave 474 , gentlemen.</p>
<p>PALAMON Now, honest keeper?</p>
<p>JAILER Lord Arcite, you must presently to th’duke:</p>
<p>The cause I know not yet.</p>
<p>ARCITE I am ready, keeper.</p>
<p>JAILER Prince Palamon, I must awhile bereave 475 you</p>
<p>Of your fair cousin’s company.</p>
<p>Exeunt Arcite and Keeper</p>
<p>PALAMON And me too,</p>
<p>Even, when you please, of life. Why is he sent for?</p>
<p>It may be he shall marry her: he’s goodly 476</p>
<p>And like enough the duke hath taken notice</p>
<p>Both of his blood 477 and body. But his falsehood 478 !</p>
<p>Why should a friend be treacherous? If that</p>
<p>Get him a wife so noble and so fair,</p>
<p>Let honest men ne’er love again. Once more</p>
<p>I would but see this fair one. Blessèd garden</p>
<p>And fruit and flowers more blessèd that still blossom</p>
<p>As her bright eyes shine on ye: would I were</p>
<p>For all the fortune of my life hereafter</p>
<p>Yon 479 little tree, yon blooming apricock 480 !</p>
<p>How I would spread and fling my wanton arms</p>
<p>In at her window 481 ! I would bring her fruit 482</p>
<p>Fit for the gods to feed on: youth and pleasure</p>
<p>Still as 483 she tasted should be doubled on her</p>
<p>And if she be not heavenly, I would make her</p>
<p>So near the gods in nature, they should fear her,</p>
<p>Enter Keeper [ Jailer ]</p>
<p>And then I am sure she would love me.— How now, keeper,</p>
<p>Where’s Arcite?</p>
<p>JAILER Banished. Prince Pirithous</p>
<p>Obtained his liberty, but never more</p>
<p>Upon his oath and life must he set foot</p>
<p>Upon this kingdom.</p>
<p>PALAMON He’s a blessèd man.</p>
<p>He shall see Thebes again, and call to arms</p>
<p>The bold young men that, when he bids ’em charge,</p>
<p>Fall on 484 like fire. Arcite shall have a fortune 485 ,</p>
<p>If he dare make himself a worthy lover,</p>
<p>Yet in the field to strike a battle 486 for her:</p>
<p>And if he lose her then, he’s a cold coward.</p>
<p>How bravely may he bear himself to win her</p>
<p>If he be noble Arcite. Thousand ways!</p>
<p>Were I at liberty, I would do things</p>
<p>Of such a virtuous greatness, that this lady,</p>
<p>This blushing virgin, should take manhood to her</p>
<p>And seek to ravish me.</p>
<p>JAILER My lord, for you</p>
<p>I have this charge 487 too.</p>
<p>PALAMON To discharge my life?</p>
<p>JAILER No, but from this place to remove your lordship:</p>
<p>The windows are too open 488 .</p>
<p>PALAMON Devils take ’em</p>
<p>That are so envious to me! Prithee 489 kill me.</p>
<p>JAILER And hang for’t afterward.</p>
<p>PALAMON By this good light 490 ,</p>
<p>Had I a sword I would kill thee.</p>
<p>JAILER Why, my lord?</p>
<p>PALAMON Thou bring’st such pelting 491 scurvy 492 news
continually,</p>
<p>Thou art not worthy life. I will not go.</p>
<p>JAILER Indeed you must, my lord.</p>
<p>PALAMON May I see the garden?</p>
<p>JAILER No.</p>
<p>PALAMON Then I am resolved: I will not go.</p>
<p>JAILER I must constrain you then: and for 493 you are dangerous
494</p>
<p>I’ll clap more irons on you.</p>
<p>PALAMON Do, good keeper.</p>
<p>I’ll shake ’em so, ye shall not sleep:</p>
<p>I’ll make ye a new morris 495 . Must I go?</p>
<p>JAILER There is no remedy.</p>
<p>PALAMON Farewell, kind window.</p>
<p>May rude wind never hurt thee.— O my lady,</p>
<p>If ever thou hast felt what sorrow was,</p>
<p>Dream how I suffer.— Come, now bury me.</p>
<p>Exeunt Palamon and Keeper</p>
