1096</h4>
<p>Enter Provost and Clown [Pompey ]</p>
<p>PROVOST Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man’s head 1097 ?</p>
<p>POMPEY If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can. But if he be a married
man, he’s his wife’s head, and I can never cut off a woman’s head.</p>
<p>PROVOST Come, sir, leave me your snatches 1098 , and yield me a
direct answer. Tomorrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine. Here
is in our prison a common 1099 executioner, who in his office lacks a
helper: if you will take it on you to assist him, it shall redeem 1100
you from your gyves 1101 : if not, you shall have your full time of
imprisonment and your deliverance 1102 with an unpitied 1103 whipping,
for you have been a notorious bawd.</p>
<p>POMPEY Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind 1104 , but
yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I would be glad to receive
some instruction from my fellow partner.</p>
<p>PROVOST What, ho, Abhorson 1105 ! Where’s Abhorson there?</p>
<p>Enter Abhorson</p>
<p>ABHORSON Do you call, sir?</p>
<p>PROVOST Sirrah, here’s a fellow will help you tomorrow in your
execution. If you think it meet 1106 , compound with him by the year
1107 , and let him abide 1108 here with you. If not, use him for the
present and dismiss him. He cannot plead his estimation 1109 with you:
he hath been a bawd.</p>
<p>ABHORSON A bawd, sir? Fie upon him, he will discredit our mystery
1110 .</p>
<p>PROVOST Go to, sir, you weigh equally 1111 : a feather will turn the
scale.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>POMPEY Pray, sir, by your good favour 1112 — for surely, sir, a good
favour you have, but that you have a hanging look 1113 — do you call,
sir, your occupation a mystery 1114 ?</p>
<p>ABHORSON Ay, sir, a mystery.</p>
<p>POMPEY Painting 1115 , sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and your
whores, sir, being members of my occupation, using painting, do prove my
occupation a mystery. But what mystery there should be in hanging, if I
should be hanged, I cannot imagine.</p>
<p>ABHORSON Sir, it is a mystery.</p>
<p>POMPEY Proof?</p>
<p>ABHORSON Every true 1116 man’s apparel fits your thief—</p>
<p>POMPEY If it be too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
big 1117 enough. If it be too big for your thief, your thief thinks it
little 1118 enough. So every true man’s apparel fits your thief.</p>
<p>Enter Provost</p>
<p>PROVOST Are you agreed?</p>
<p>POMPEY Sir, I will serve him, for I do find your hangman is a more
penitent 1119 trade than your bawd: he doth oftener ask forgiveness 1120
.</p>
<p>PROVOST You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe tomorrow, four
o’clock.</p>
<p>ABHORSON Come on, bawd, I will instruct thee in my trade. Follow.</p>
<p>POMPEY I do desire to learn, sir, and I hope, if you have occasion to
use me for your own turn 1121 , you shall find me yare 1122 . For truly,
sir, for your kindness I owe you a good turn 1123 .</p>
<p>[Exeunt Pompey and Abhorson ]</p>
<p>PROVOST Call hither Barnardine and Claudio.</p>
<p>The one has my pity; not a jot the other,</p>
<p>Being a murderer, though 1124 he were my brother.</p>
<p>Enter Claudio</p>
<p>Look, here’s the warrant, Claudio, for thy death.</p>
<p>Shows warrant</p>
<p>’Tis now dead midnight, and by eight tomorrow</p>
<p>Thou must be made immortal. Where’s Barnardine?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO As fast locked up in sleep as guiltless labour 1125</p>
<p>When it lies starkly 1126 in the traveller’s 1127 bones.</p>
<p>He will not wake.</p>
<p>PROVOST Who can do good on 1128 him?</p>
<p>Well, go, prepare yourself. But hark, what noise?</p>
<p>Knocking within</p>
<p>Heaven give your spirits comfort.— By and by.</p>
<p>[Exit Claudio ]</p>
<p>I hope it is some pardon or reprieve</p>
<p>For the most gentle Claudio.</p>
<p>Enter Duke [disguised as before ]</p>
<p>Welcome father.</p>
<p>DUKE The best and wholesom’st spirits of the night</p>
<p>Envelop you, good provost. Who called here of late?</p>
<p>PROVOST None, since the curfew 1129 rung.</p>
<p>DUKE Not Isabel?</p>
<p>PROVOST No.</p>
<p>DUKE They will, then, ere’t be long.</p>
<p>PROVOST What comfort is for Claudio?</p>
<p>DUKE There’s some in hope.</p>
<p>PROVOST It is a bitter deputy.</p>
<p>DUKE Not so, not so: his life is paralleled 1130</p>
<p>Even 1131 with the stroke and line 1132 of his great justice.</p>
<p>He doth with holy abstinence subdue</p>
<p>That in himself which he spurs on his power</p>
<p>To qualify 1133 in others. Were he mealed 1134 with that</p>
<p>Which he corrects 1135 , then were he tyrannous,</p>
<p>But this 1136 being so, he’s just. Now are they come.</p>
<p>[Exit Provost ]</p>
<p>This is a gentle 1137 provost: seldom when 1138</p>
<p>The steelèd 1139 jailer is the friend of men.</p>
<p>Knocking within</p>
<p>How now? What noise? That spirit’s 1140 possessed with haste</p>
<p>That wounds th’unsisting 1141 postern 1142 with these strokes.</p>
<p>[Enter Provost ]</p>
<p>PROVOST There he must stay until the officer</p>
<p>Arise to let him in. He is called up 1143 .</p>
<p>DUKE Have you no countermand 1144 for Claudio yet,</p>
<p>But he must die tomorrow?</p>
<p>PROVOST None, sir, none.</p>
<p>DUKE As near the dawning, Provost, as it is,</p>
<p>You shall hear more ere morning.</p>
<p>PROVOST Happily 1145</p>
<p>You something know, yet I believe there comes</p>
<p>No countermand, no such example 1146 have we:</p>
<p>Besides, upon the very siege 1147 of justice</p>
<p>Lord Angelo hath to the public ear</p>
<p>Professed the contrary.</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>This is his lordship’s man.</p>
<p>DUKE And here comes Claudio’s pardon.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>MESSENGER My lord hath sent you this note, and by me this further
charge, that you swerve not from the smallest article of it, neither in
time, matter, or other circumstance. Good morrow, for, as I take it, it
is almost day.</p>
<p>Gives a paper</p>
<p>PROVOST I shall obey him.</p>
<p>[Exit Messenger ]</p>
<p>DUKE This is his pardon, purchased by such sin 1148</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>For which the pardoner himself is in.</p>
<p>Hence hath offence his quick celerity,</p>
<p>When it is borne in high authority 1149 .</p>
<p>When vice makes mercy, mercy’s so extended 1150 ,</p>
<p>That for the fault’s love 1151 is th’offender friended 1152 .—</p>
<p>Now, sir, what news?</p>
<p>PROVOST I told you. Lord Angelo, belike 1153 thinking me remiss 1154
in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted 1155 putting-on 1156 ,
methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.</p>
<p>DUKE Pray you let’s hear.</p>
<p>PROVOST ‘Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let Claudio be
executed by four of the clock, and in the afternoon Barnardine. For my
better satisfaction 1157 , let me have Claudio’s head sent me by five.
Let this be duly 1158 performed with a thought 1159 that more depends on
it than we must yet deliver 1160 . Thus fail not to do your office, as
you will answer 1161 it at your peril 1162 .’ What 1163 say you to this,
sir?</p>
<p>Reads the letter</p>
<p>DUKE What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in
th’afternoon?</p>
<p>PROVOST A Bohemian born, but here nursed up and bred, one that is a
prisoner nine years old 1164 .</p>
<p>DUKE How came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to
his liberty or executed him? I have heard it was ever his manner to do
so.</p>
<p>PROVOST His friends still wrought 1165 reprieves for him: and indeed,
his fact 1166 , till now in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to
an undoubtful 1167 proof.</p>
<p>DUKE It is now apparent?</p>
<p>PROVOST Most manifest, and not denied by himself.</p>
<p>DUKE Hath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to be
touched 1168 ?</p>
<p>PROVOST A man that apprehends 1169 death no more dreadfully 1170 but
as a drunken sleep, careless, reckless, and fearless of what’s past,
present, or to come: insensible of mortal 1171 ity and desperately
mortal.</p>
<p>DUKE He wants 1172 advice 1173 .</p>
<p>PROVOST He will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the
prison 1174 . Give him leave to escape hence, he would not. Drunk many
times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked
him, as if to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming 1175
warrant for it, it hath not moved him at all.</p>
<p>DUKE More of him anon. There is written in your brow, Provost,
honesty and constancy. If I read it not truly, my ancient skill beguiles
1176 me, but in the boldness of my cunning 1177 , I will lay myself in
hazard 1178 . Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is no
greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenced him. To make
you understand this in a manifested effect 1179 , I crave but four days’
respite, for the which you are to do me both a present 1180 and a
dangerous courtesy 1181 .</p>
<p>PROVOST Pray, sir, in what?</p>
<p>DUKE In the delaying death.</p>
<p>PROVOST Alack, how may I do it, having the hour limited 1182 and an
express command, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view of
Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio’s 1183 , to cross 1184 this in the
smallest.</p>
<p>DUKE By the vow of mine order, I warrant 1185 you, if my instructions
may be your guide, let this Barnardine be this morning executed, and his
head borne to Angelo.</p>
<p>PROVOST Angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour 1186
.</p>
<p>DUKE O, death’s a great disguiser, and you may add to it. Shave the
head and tie 1187 the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to
be so bared 1188 before his death: you know the course 1189 is common.
If anything fall to you upon this 1190 , more than thanks and good
fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead against it with my
life.</p>
<p>PROVOST Pardon me, good father, it is against my oath.</p>
<p>DUKE Were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy?</p>
<p>PROVOST To him and to his substitutes.</p>
<p>DUKE You will think you have made no offence, if the duke avouch 1191
the justice of your dealing?</p>
<p>PROVOST But what likelihood is in that?</p>
<p>DUKE Not a resemblance 1192 , but a certainty. Yet since I see you
fearful that neither my coat 1193 , integrity, nor persuasion can with
ease attempt 1194 you, I will go further than I meant, to pluck all
fears out of you. Look you, sir, here is the hand 1195 and seal of the
duke: you know the character 1196 , I doubt not, and the signet 1197 is
not strange 1198 to you.</p>
<p>Shows a letter</p>
<p>PROVOST I know them both.</p>
<p>DUKE The contents of this is the return of the duke; you shall anon
over-read it at your pleasure, where you shall find within these two
days he will be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows not, for he this
very day receives letters of strange tenor 1199 , perchance of the
duke’s death, perchance entering into some monastery, but by chance
nothing of what is writ 1200 . Look, th’unfolding star 1201 calls up the
shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be;
all difficulties are but easy when they are known. Call your
executioner, and off with Barnardine’s head. I will give him a present
shrift 1202 and advise him for a better place 1203 . Yet 1204 you are
amazed, but this 1205 shall absolutely resolve you 1206 . Come away. It
is almost clear dawn.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
