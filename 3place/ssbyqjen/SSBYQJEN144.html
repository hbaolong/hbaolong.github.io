<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-6">Scene 2 / running scene 6</h4>
<p>Enter Ladies [the Princess, Katherine, Rosaline and Maria ]</p>
<p>PRINCESS Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,</p>
<p>If fairings 1313 come thus plentifully in.</p>
<p>A lady walled about with diamonds! 1314</p>
<p>Look you what I have from the loving king.</p>
<p>Shows a jewel</p>
<p>ROSALINE Madame, came nothing else along with that?</p>
<p>PRINCESS Nothing but this? Yes, as much love in rhyme</p>
<p>As would be crammed up in a sheet of paper</p>
<p>Writ on both sides the leaf, margent 1315 and all,</p>
<p>That he was fain to seal on Cupid’s name 1316 .</p>
<p>ROSALINE That was the way to make his godhead 1317 wax 1318 ,</p>
<p>For he hath been five thousand years a boy 1319 .</p>
<p>KATHERINE Ay, and a shrewd 1320 unhappy 1321 gallows 1322 too.</p>
<p>ROSALINE You’ll ne’er be friends with him: a killed your sister 1323
.</p>
<p>KATHERINE He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy 1324 ,</p>
<p>And so she died: had she been light 1325 , like you,</p>
<p>Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,</p>
<p>She might ha’ been a grandam 1326 ere she died.</p>
<p>And so may you, for a light heart lives long.</p>
<p>ROSALINE What’s your dark 1327 meaning, mouse 1328 , of this light
word 1329 ?</p>
<p>KATHERINE A light condition 1330 in a beauty dark.</p>
<p>ROSALINE We need more light to find your meaning out.</p>
<p>KATHERINE You’ll mar the light by taking it in snuff 1331 :</p>
<p>Therefore I’ll darkly 1332 end the argument.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Look what 1333 you do, you do it 1334 still i’th’dark.</p>
<p>KATHERINE So do not you, for you are a light wench 1335 .</p>
<p>ROSALINE Indeed I weigh not 1336 you, and therefore light.</p>
<p>KATHERINE You weigh 1337 me not? O, that’s 1338 you care not for
me.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Great reason, for past care is still past cure 1339 .</p>
<p>PRINCESS Well bandied 1340 both. A set 1341 of wit well played.</p>
<p>But Rosaline, you have a favour 1342 too.</p>
<p>Who sent it? And what is it?</p>
<p>ROSALINE I would 1343 you knew.</p>
<p>An if my face were but as fair as yours,</p>
<p>My favour were as great. Be witness this:</p>
<p>Shows a love token and a letter</p>
<p>Nay, I have verses too, I thank Berowne.</p>
<p>The numbers true 1344 , and, were the numbering 1345 too,</p>
<p>I were the fairest goddess on the ground.</p>
<p>I am compared to twenty thousand fairs 1346 .</p>
<p>O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!</p>
<p>PRINCESS Anything like?</p>
<p>ROSALINE Much in the letters 1347 , nothing in the praise 1348 .</p>
<p>PRINCESS Beauteous as ink: a good conclusion.</p>
<p>KATHERINE Fair as a text B 1349 in a copy-book 1350 .</p>
<p>ROSALINE ’Ware 1351 pencils 1352 , how? Let me not die your debtor
1353 ,</p>
<p>My red dominical 1354 , my golden 1355 letter.</p>
<p>O, that your face were not so full of O’s 1356 !</p>
<p>PRINCESS A pox 1357 of that jest and I beshrew 1358 all shrews 1359
.</p>
<p>But, Katherine, what was sent to you from fair Dumaine?</p>
<p>KATHERINE Madam, this glove.</p>
<p>Shows a glove</p>
<p>PRINCESS Did he not send you twain 1360 ?</p>
<p>KATHERINE Yes, madam, and moreover</p>
<p>Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,</p>
<p>A huge translation 1361 of hypocrisy,</p>
<p>Vilely compiled, profound simplicity 1362 .</p>
<p>MARIA This and these pearls to me sent Longaville.</p>
<p>Shows a letter and a pearl necklace</p>
<p>The letter is too long by half a mile.</p>
<p>PRINCESS I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart</p>
<p>The chain were longer and the letter short?</p>
<p>MARIA Ay, or I would 1363 these hands might never part 1364 .</p>
<p>PRINCESS We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.</p>
<p>ROSALINE They are worse fools to purchase 1365 mocking so.</p>
<p>That same Berowne I’ll torture ere I go.</p>
<p>O that I knew he were but in by th’week 1366 !</p>
<p>How I would make him fawn and beg and seek</p>
<p>And wait the season 1367 and observe the times 1368</p>
<p>And spend his prodigal 1369 wits in bootless 1370 rhymes</p>
<p>And shape his service wholly to my device</p>
<p>And make him proud to make me proud that jests 1371 !</p>
<p>So pert aunt like 1372 would I o’ersway 1373 his state</p>
<p>That he should be my fool and I his fate 1374 .</p>
<p>PRINCESS None are so surely 1375 caught, when they are catched,</p>
<p>As wit turned fool. Folly, in wisdom hatched,</p>
<p>Hath wisdom’s warrant 1376 and the help of school</p>
<p>And wit’s own grace to grace a learnèd fool.</p>
<p>ROSALINE The blood of youth burns not with such excess</p>
<p>As gravity 1377 ’s revolt to wantonness 1378 .</p>
<p>MARIA Folly in fools bears not so strong a note 1379</p>
<p>As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote 1380 ,</p>
<p>Since all the power thereof it doth apply</p>
<p>To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity 1381 .</p>
<p>Enter Boyet</p>
<p>PRINCESS Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.</p>
<p>BOYET O, I am stabbed with laughter! Where’s her grace?</p>
<p>PRINCESS Thy news, Boyet?</p>
<p>BOYET Prepare, madam, prepare!</p>
<p>Arm 1382 , wenches, arm! Encounters mounted are 1383</p>
<p>Against your peace. Love doth approach disguised,</p>
<p>Armed in arguments: you’ll be surprised 1384 .</p>
<p>Muster 1385 your wits, stand in your own defence,</p>
<p>Or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Saint Denis 1386 to 1387 Saint Cupid! What are they</p>
<p>That charge 1388 their breath 1389 against us? Say, scout 1390 ,
say.</p>
<p>BOYET Under the cool shade of a sycamore 1391</p>
<p>I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour,</p>
<p>When, lo, to interrupt my purposed 1392 rest,</p>
<p>Toward that shade I might behold addressed 1393</p>
<p>The king and his companions. Warily</p>
<p>I stole into a neighbour thicket by 1394 ,</p>
<p>And overhear 1395 d what you shall overhear:</p>
<p>That, by and by 1396 , disguised they will be here.</p>
<p>Their herald is a pretty knavish page,</p>
<p>That well by heart hath conned 1397 his embassage 1398 .</p>
<p>Action 1399 and accent 1400 did they teach him there:</p>
<p>‘Thus must thou speak’, and ‘thus thy body bear’.</p>
<p>And ever and anon 1401 they made a doubt 1402</p>
<p>Presence majestical 1403 would put him out 1404 ,</p>
<p>‘For’, quoth the king, ’an angel shalt thou see,</p>
<p>Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.’</p>
<p>The boy replied, ’An angel is not evil:</p>
<p>I should have feared her had she been a devil.’</p>
<p>With that, all laughed and clapped him on the shoulder,</p>
<p>Making the bold wag 1405 by their praises bolder.</p>
<p>One rubbed his elbow 1406 thus, and fleered 1407 and swore</p>
<p>A better speech was never spoke before.</p>
<p>Another, with his finger and his thumb 1408</p>
<p>Cried, ‘Via ! 1409 We will do’t, come what will come.’</p>
<p>The third he capered 1410 , and cried, ‘All goes well.’</p>
<p>The fourth turned on the toe 1411 , and down he fell.</p>
<p>With that they all did tumble on the ground,</p>
<p>With such a zealous laughter, so profound,</p>
<p>That in this spleen ridiculous 1412 appears,</p>
<p>To check 1413 their folly, passion’s solemn tears.</p>
<p>PRINCESS But what, but what, come they to visit us?</p>
<p>BOYET They do, they do, and are apparelled thus:</p>
<p>Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess 1414 .</p>
<p>Their purpose is to parley 1415 , to court and dance,</p>
<p>And every one his love-feat 1416 will advance</p>
<p>Unto his several 1417 mistress, which they’ll know</p>
<p>By favours several which they did bestow.</p>
<p>PRINCESS And will they so? The gallants 1418 shall be tasked 1419
,</p>
<p>For, ladies, we will every one be masked,</p>
<p>And not a man of them shall have the grace 1420 ,</p>
<p>Despite of suit 1421 , to see a lady’s face.</p>
<p>Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,</p>
<p>And then the king will court thee for his dear 1422 .</p>
<p>Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,</p>
<p>So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline.</p>
<p>The Princess and Rosaline exchange 1423 favours</p>
<p>And change your favours too, so shall your loves</p>
<p>Woo contrary, deceived by these removes 1424 .</p>
<p>Katherine and Maria exchange favours</p>
<p>ROSALINE Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight 1425 .</p>
<p>KATHERINE But in this changing what is your intent?</p>
<p>PRINCESS The effect of my intent is to cross 1426 theirs:</p>
<p>They do it but in mocking merriment,</p>
<p>And mock for mock is only my intent.</p>
<p>Their several counsels 1427 they unbosom 1428 shall</p>
<p>To loves mistook 1429 , and so be mocked withal 1430</p>
<p>Upon the next occasion that we meet,</p>
<p>With visages displayed 1431 to talk and greet.</p>
<p>ROSALINE But shall we dance, if they desire us to’t?</p>
<p>PRINCESS No, to the death 1432 , we will not move a foot,</p>
<p>Nor to their penned 1433 speech render 1434 we no grace 1435 ,</p>
<p>But while ’tis spoke each turn away her face.</p>
<p>BOYET Why, that contempt will kill the speaker’s heart 1436</p>
<p>And quite divorce his memory from his part 1437 .</p>
<p>PRINCESS Therefore I do it, and I make no doubt</p>
<p>The rest will e’er come in, if he be out 1438 .</p>
<p>There’s no such sport as sport by sport o’erthrown,</p>
<p>To make theirs ours 1439 and ours none but our own.</p>
<p>So shall we stay, mocking intended 1440 game,</p>
<p>And they, well mocked, depart away with shame.</p>
<p>[Trumpets ] sound</p>
<p>BOYET The trumpet sounds: be masked. The maskers come.</p>
<p>The Ladies mask</p>
<p>Enter Blackamoors 1441 with music, the boy [Moth ] with a speech, and
the rest of the Lords [King, Berowne, Longaville and Dumaine ] disguised
[in Russian costumes and masks ]</p>
<p>MOTH All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!</p>
<p>BEROWNE Beauties no richer than rich taffeta 1442 .</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>MOTH A holy parcel 1443 of the fairest dames.</p>
<p>That ever turned their —</p>
<p>The Ladies turn their backs to him</p>
<p>backs — to mortal views.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Their eyes , villain, their eyes !</p>
<p>Aside to Moth</p>
<p>MOTH That ever turned their eyes to mortal views! Out … 1444</p>
<p>BOYET True. Out indeed.</p>
<p>MOTH Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe 1445</p>
<p>Not to behold—</p>
<p>BEROWNE Once to behold, rogue.</p>
<p>Aside to Moth</p>
<p>MOTH Once to behold with your sun-beamèd eyes …</p>
<p>With your sun-beamèd eyes …</p>
<p>BOYET They will not answer to that epithet 1446 .</p>
<p>You were best call it ‘daughter-beamèd 1447 eyes’.</p>
<p>MOTH They do not mark me and that brings me out 1448 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE Is this your perfectness 1449 ? Be gone, you rogue!</p>
<p>[Exit Moth ]</p>
<p>ROSALINE What would these strangers? 1450 Know their minds 1451 ,
Boyet.</p>
<p>Pretends to be the Princess</p>
<p>If they do speak our language, ’tis our will</p>
<p>That some plain 1452 man recount their purposes</p>
<p>Know what they would.</p>
<p>BOYET What would you with the princess?</p>
<p>BEROWNE Nothing but peace and gentle visitation 1453 .</p>
<p>ROSALINE What would they, say they?</p>
<p>BOYET Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Why, that they have, and bid them so be gone.</p>
<p>BOYET She says, you have it, and you may be gone.</p>
<p>KING Say to her, we ’have measured 1454 many miles</p>
<p>To tread a measure 1455 with you on the grass’.</p>
<p>BOYET They say that they have measured many a mile</p>
<p>To tread a measure with you on this grass.</p>
<p>ROSALINE It is not so. Ask them how many inches</p>
<p>Is in one mile. If they have measured many,</p>
<p>The measure 1456 then of one is easily told 1457 .</p>
<p>BOYET If to come hither you have measured miles,</p>
<p>And many miles, the princess bids you tell</p>
<p>How many inches doth fill up one mile.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Tell her we measure them by weary steps.</p>
<p>BOYET She hears herself.</p>
<p>ROSALINE How many weary steps,</p>
<p>Of many weary miles you have o’ergone,</p>
<p>Are numbered in the travel 1458 of one mile?</p>
<p>BEROWNE We number 1459 nothing that we spend for you.</p>
<p>Our duty is so rich, so infinite,</p>
<p>That we may do it still 1460 without account 1461 .</p>
<p>Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,</p>
<p>That we, like savages, may worship it.</p>
<p>ROSALINE My face is but a moon 1462 , and clouded 1463 too.</p>
<p>KING Blessèd are clouds, to do as such clouds do 1464 !</p>
<p>Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars 1465 , to shine,</p>
<p>Those clouds removed, upon our wat’ry eyne 1466 .</p>
<p>ROSALINE O vain petitioner! Beg a greater matter:</p>
<p>Thou now requests but moonshine in the water 1467 .</p>
<p>KING Then, in our measure vouchsafe but one change 1468 .</p>
<p>Thou bid’st me beg: this begging is not strange 1469 .</p>
<p>ROSALINE Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.</p>
<p>Music plays</p>
<p>Not yet? No dance! Thus change I like the moon.</p>
<p>KING Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged 1470 ?</p>
<p>ROSALINE You took the moon at full, but now she’s changed.</p>
<p>KING Yet still she is the moon, and I the man 1471 .</p>
<p>ROSALINE The music plays, vouchsafe some motion 1472 to it 1473 .</p>
<p>Our ears vouchsafe it.</p>
<p>KING But your legs should do it.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Since you are strangers and come here by chance,</p>
<p>We’ll not be nice 1474 : take hands. We will not dance.</p>
<p>Offers her hand</p>
<p>KING Why take you hands, then?</p>
<p>ROSALINE Only to part friends.</p>
<p>Curtsy, sweet hearts, and so the measure 1475 ends.</p>
<p>Music stops</p>
<p>KING More measure of this measure. Be not nice.</p>
<p>ROSALINE We can afford no more at such a price.</p>
<p>KING Price 1476 yourselves: what buys your company?</p>
<p>ROSALINE Your absence only.</p>
<p>KING That can never be.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Then cannot we be bought. And so, adieu.</p>
<p>Twice to your visor and half once to you 1477 .</p>
<p>KING If you deny 1478 to dance, let’s hold more chat.</p>
<p>ROSALINE In private then.</p>
<p>KING I am best pleased with that.</p>
<p>They talk apart</p>
<p>BEROWNE White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.</p>
<p>To the Princess</p>
<p>PRINCESS Honey and milk and sugar: there is three 1479 .</p>
<p>Pretends to be Rosaline</p>
<p>BEROWNE Nay then, two treys 1480 , and if you grow so nice 1481 ,</p>
<p>Metheglin 1482 , wort 1483 and malmsey 1484 . Well run 1485 ,
dice!</p>
<p>There’s half-a-dozen sweets 1486 .</p>
<p>PRINCESS Seventh sweet, adieu.</p>
<p>Since you can cog 1487 , I’ll play no more with you.</p>
<p>BEROWNE One word in secret.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Let it not be sweet.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Thou griev’st 1488 my gall 1489 .</p>
<p>PRINCESS Gall! Bitter.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Therefore meet 1490 .</p>
<p>They talk apart</p>
<p>DUMAINE Will you vouchsafe with me to change 1491 a word?</p>
<p>To Maria</p>
<p>MARIA Name it.</p>
<p>Pretends to be Katherine</p>
<p>DUMAINE Fair lady—</p>
<p>MARIA Say you so? Fair lord.</p>
<p>Take you that for your ‘fair lady’.</p>
<p>DUMAINE Please it you 1492 ,</p>
<p>As much in private, and I’ll bid adieu.</p>
<p>They talk apart</p>
<p>KATHERINE What, was your vizard 1493 made without a tongue 1494 ?</p>
<p>Pretends to be Maria</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE I know the reason, lady, why you ask.</p>
<p>KATHERINE O for your reason! Quickly, sir, I long.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE You have a double tongue 1495 within your mask</p>
<p>And would afford my speechless vizard half 1496 .</p>
<p>KATHERINE ‘Veal’ 1497 , quoth the Dutchman. Is not ‘veal’ a calf 1498
?</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE A calf, fair lady?</p>
<p>KATHERINE No, a fair lord calf.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE Let’s part 1499 the word.</p>
<p>KATHERINE No, I’ll not be your half 1500 .</p>
<p>Take all, and wean 1501 it, it may prove an ox 1502 .</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE Look, how you butt 1503 yourself in these sharp mocks.</p>
<p>Will you give horns 1504 , chaste lady? Do not so.</p>
<p>KATHERINE Then die a calf before your horns do grow.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE One word in private with you ere I die.</p>
<p>KATHERINE Bleat softly then, the butcher hears you cry.</p>
<p>They talk apart</p>
<p>BOYET The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen 1505</p>
<p>As is the razor’s edge invisible,</p>
<p>Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,</p>
<p>Above the sense 1506 of sense, so sensible 1507</p>
<p>Seemeth their conference 1508 . Their conceits 1509 have wings</p>
<p>Fleeter 1510 than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Not one word more, my maids: break off, break off.</p>
<p>BEROWNE By heaven, all dry-beaten 1511 with pure scoff 1512 !</p>
<p>KING Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.</p>
<p>Exeunt [ King, Berowne, Longaville, Dumaine and Blackamoors ]</p>
<p>PRINCESS Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovites.</p>
<p>The ladies unmask</p>
<p>Are these the breed of wits so wondered at?</p>
<p>BOYET Tapers 1513 they are, with 1514 your sweet breaths puffed
out.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Well-liking 1515 wits they have: gross 1516 , gross, fat,
fat.</p>
<p>PRINCESS O, poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout 1517 !</p>
<p>Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?</p>
<p>Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?</p>
<p>This pert 1518 Berowne was out of countenance quite 1519 .</p>
<p>ROSALINE They were all in lamentable cases 1520 .</p>
<p>The king was weeping-ripe 1521 for a good word.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Berowne did swear himself out of all suit 1522 .</p>
<p>MARIA Dumaine was at my service, and his sword.</p>
<p>‘No point’, quoth I: my servant 1523 straight 1524 was mute.</p>
<p>KATHERINE Lord Longaville said I came o’er 1525 his heart:</p>
<p>And trow you 1526 what he called me?</p>
<p>PRINCESS Qualm 1527 , perhaps.</p>
<p>KATHERINE Yes, in good faith.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Go, sickness as thou art!</p>
<p>ROSALINE Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps 1528 .</p>
<p>But will you hear? The king is my love sworn.</p>
<p>PRINCESS And quick 1529 Berowne hath plighted faith to me.</p>
<p>KATHERINE And Longaville was for my service born.</p>
<p>MARIA Dumaine is mine as sure as bark on tree.</p>
<p>BOYET Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear 1530 :</p>
<p>Immediately they will again be here</p>
<p>In their own shapes 1531 , for it can never be</p>
<p>They will digest 1532 this harsh indignity.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Will they return?</p>
<p>BOYET They will, they will, God knows,</p>
<p>And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:</p>
<p>Therefore change favours, and, when they repair 1533 ,</p>
<p>Blow 1534 like sweet roses in this summer air.</p>
<p>PRINCESS How blow? How blow? Speak to be understood.</p>
<p>BOYET Fair ladies masked are roses in their bud:</p>
<p>Dismasked, their damask 1535 sweet commixture 1536 shown,</p>
<p>Are angels vailing 1537 clouds, or roses blown.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Avaunt 1538 , perplexity 1539 ! What shall we do</p>
<p>If they return in their own shapes to woo?</p>
<p>ROSALINE Good madam, if by me you’ll be advised</p>
<p>Let’s mock them still, as well known as disguised 1540 .</p>
<p>Let us complain to them what fools were here,</p>
<p>Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear 1541 :</p>
<p>And wonder what they were and to what end 1542</p>
<p>Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penned,</p>
<p>And their rough carriage 1543 so ridiculous,</p>
<p>Should be presented at our tent to us.</p>
<p>BOYET Ladies, withdraw. The gallants are at hand.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Whip to our tents, as roes 1544 runs o’er land.</p>
<p>Exeunt [the Princess, Rosaline, Katherine and Maria ]</p>
<p>Enter the King and the rest [Berowne, Longaville and Dumaine, as
themselves ]</p>
<p>KING Fair sir, God save you! Where’s the princess?</p>
<p>BOYET Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty</p>
<p>Command me any service to her?</p>
<p>KING That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.</p>
<p>BOYET I will, and so will she, I know, my lord.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>BEROWNE This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons peas</p>
<p>And utters 1545 it again when Jove doth please.</p>
<p>He is wit’s pedlar and retails his wares</p>
<p>At wakes 1546 and wassails 1547 , meetings, markets, fairs.</p>
<p>And we that sell by gross 1548 , the Lord doth know,</p>
<p>Have not the grace to grace it with such show.</p>
<p>This gallant 1549 pins the wenches on his sleeve 1550 .</p>
<p>Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve 1551 .</p>
<p>He can carve 1552 too, and lisp 1553 . Why, this is he</p>
<p>That kissed away his hand in courtesy 1554 .</p>
<p>This is the ape of form 1555 , Monsieur the Nice 1556 ,</p>
<p>That when he plays at tables 1557 chides the dice</p>
<p>In honourable 1558 terms. Nay, he can sing</p>
<p>A mean 1559 most meanly 1560 , and in ushering 1561</p>
<p>Mend 1562 him who can. The ladies call him sweet.</p>
<p>The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet.</p>
<p>This is the flower that smiles on everyone,</p>
<p>To show his teeth as white as whale’s bone</p>
<p>And consciences that will not die in debt</p>
<p>Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.</p>
<p>KING A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,</p>
<p>That put Armado’s page out of his part 1563 !</p>
<p>Enter the Ladies [the Princess, Rosaline, Maria and Katherine, with
Boyet ]</p>
<p>BEROWNE See where it 1564 comes! Behaviour 1565 , what wert thou</p>
<p>Till this madman 1566 showed thee? And what art thou now?</p>
<p>KING All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!</p>
<p>PRINCESS ‘Fair’ in ‘all hail’ is foul 1567 , as I conceive.</p>
<p>KING Construe 1568 my speeches better, if you may.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Then wish me 1569 better, I will give you leave 1570 .</p>
<p>KING We came to visit you and purpose now</p>
<p>To lead you to our court. Vouchsafe it then.</p>
<p>PRINCESS This field shall hold me 1571 , and so hold 1572 your
vow.</p>
<p>Nor 1573 God nor I delights in perjured men.</p>
<p>KING Rebuke me not for that which you provoke.</p>
<p>The virtue of your eye must break my oath.</p>
<p>PRINCESS You nickname 1574 virtue: ‘vice’ you should have spoke,</p>
<p>For virtue’s office 1575 never breaks men’s troth.</p>
<p>Now, by my maiden honour, yet 1576 as pure</p>
<p>As the unsullied lily, I protest 1577 ,</p>
<p>A world of torments though I should endure,</p>
<p>I would not yield to be your house’s guest,</p>
<p>So much I hate a breaking cause to be</p>
<p>Of 1578 heavenly oaths, vowed with integrity.</p>
<p>KING O, you have lived in desolation 1579 here,</p>
<p>Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Not so, my lord. It is not so, I swear.</p>
<p>We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:</p>
<p>A mess of Russians left us but of late 1580 .</p>
<p>KING How, madam? Russians?</p>
<p>PRINCESS Ay, in truth, my lord.</p>
<p>Trim 1581 gallants, full of courtship 1582 and of state 1583 .</p>
<p>ROSALINE Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord.</p>
<p>My lady, to the manner of the days 1584 ,</p>
<p>In courtesy gives undeserving 1585 praise.</p>
<p>We four indeed confronted were with four</p>
<p>In Russian habit. Here they stayed an hour,</p>
<p>And talked apace 1586 ; and in that hour, my lord,</p>
<p>They did not bless us with one happy 1587 word.</p>
<p>I dare not call them fools; but this I think,</p>
<p>When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink 1588 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE This jest is dry 1589 to me. Fair gentle sweet,</p>
<p>Your wits makes wise things foolish. When we greet,</p>
<p>With eyes best seeing, heaven’s fiery eye,</p>
<p>By light 1590 we lose light. Your capacity 1591</p>
<p>Is of that nature that to 1592 your huge store</p>
<p>Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.</p>
<p>ROSALINE This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye 1593 —</p>
<p>BEROWNE I am a fool, and full of poverty.</p>
<p>ROSALINE But that you take what doth to you belong,</p>
<p>It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.</p>
<p>BEROWNE O, I am yours, and all that I possess!</p>
<p>ROSALINE All the fool mine?</p>
<p>BEROWNE I cannot give you less.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Which of the vizards was it that you wore?</p>
<p>BEROWNE Where? When? What vizard? Why demand you this?</p>
<p>ROSALINE There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case 1594</p>
<p>That hid the worse and showed the better face.</p>
<p>KING We are descried 1595 ; they’ll mock us now downright.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>DUMAINE Let us confess and turn it to a jest.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>PRINCESS Amazed 1596 , my lord? Why looks your highness sad?</p>
<p>ROSALINE Help, hold his brows 1597 ! He’ll swoon! Why look you
pale?</p>
<p>Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy 1598 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.</p>
<p>Can any face of brass 1599 hold longer out?</p>
<p>Here stand I lady, dart thy skill 1600 at me;</p>
<p>Bruise me with scorn, confound 1601 me with a flout 1602 ,</p>
<p>Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance,</p>
<p>Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit 1603 ,</p>
<p>And I will wish 1604 thee never more to dance,</p>
<p>Nor never more in Russian habit 1605 wait 1606 .</p>
<p>O, never will I trust to speeches penned,</p>
<p>Nor to the motion 1607 of a schoolboy’s tongue,</p>
<p>Nor never come in vizard to my friend 1608 ,</p>
<p>Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper’s 1609 song!</p>
<p>Taffeta 1610 phrases, silken terms precise 1611 ,</p>
<p>Three-piled 1612 hyperboles, spruce affectation,</p>
<p>Figures 1613 pedantical 1614 ; these summer-flies</p>
<p>Have blown 1615 me full of maggot ostentation.</p>
<p>I do forswear them; and I here protest,</p>
<p>By this white glove — how white the hand, God knows! —</p>
<p>Henceforth my wooing mind shall be expressed</p>
<p>In russet 1616 yeas and honest kersey 1617 noes.</p>
<p>And, to begin, wench — so God help me, law 1618 ! —</p>
<p>My love to thee is sound, sans 1619 crack or flaw.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Sans ‘sans’ 1620 , I pray you.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Yet I have a trick 1621</p>
<p>Of the old rage 1622 . Bear with me, I am sick.</p>
<p>I’ll leave it by degrees 1623 . Soft, let us see:</p>
<p>Write, ‘Lord have mercy on us’ 1624 on those three.</p>
<p>They are infected, in their hearts it lies:</p>
<p>They have the plague, and caught it of 1625 your eyes.</p>
<p>These lords are visited 1626 , you are not free 1627 ,</p>
<p>For the Lord’s tokens 1628 on you do I see.</p>
<p>PRINCESS No, they are free 1629 that gave these tokens to us.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Our states 1630 are forfeit. Seek not to undo us.</p>
<p>ROSALINE It is not so, for how can this be true,</p>
<p>That you stand forfeit, being those that sue 1631 ?</p>
<p>BEROWNE Peace! For I will not have to do 1632 with you.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Speak for yourselves. My wit is at an end.</p>
<p>To the Lords</p>
<p>KING Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression</p>
<p>Some fair excuse.</p>
<p>PRINCESS The fairest is confession.</p>
<p>Were you not here but even 1633 now disguised?</p>
<p>KING Madam, I was.</p>
<p>PRINCESS And were you well advised 1634 ?</p>
<p>KING I was, fair madam.</p>
<p>PRINCESS When you then were here,</p>
<p>What did you whisper in your lady’s ear?</p>
<p>KING That more than all the world I did respect 1635 her.</p>
<p>PRINCESS When she shall challenge 1636 this, you will reject her.</p>
<p>KING Upon mine honour, no.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Peace, peace, forbear 1637 .</p>
<p>Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear 1638 .</p>
<p>KING Despise me when I break this oath of mine.</p>
<p>PRINCESS I will: and therefore keep it.— Rosaline,</p>
<p>What did the Russian whisper in your ear?</p>
<p>ROSALINE Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear</p>
<p>As precious eyesight, and did value me</p>
<p>Above this world: adding thereto moreover</p>
<p>That he would wed me or else die my lover.</p>
<p>PRINCESS God give thee joy of him. The noble lord</p>
<p>Most honourably doth uphold his word.</p>
<p>KING What mean you, madam? By my life, my troth,</p>
<p>I never swore this lady such an oath.</p>
<p>ROSALINE By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,</p>
<p>You gave me this. But take it, sir, again.</p>
<p>Shows the Princess’ favour</p>
<p>KING My faith and this the princess I did give.</p>
<p>I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear,</p>
<p>And Lord Berowne, I thank him, is my dear.—</p>
<p>What, will you have me or your pearl again?</p>
<p>To Berowne as she shows Rosaline’s favour</p>
<p>BEROWNE Neither 1639 of either, I remit 1640 both twain.</p>
<p>I see the trick on’t 1641 . Here was a consent 1642 ,</p>
<p>Knowing aforehand of our merriment,</p>
<p>To dash 1643 it like a Christmas comedy 1644 .</p>
<p>Some carry-tale 1645 , some please-man 1646 , some slight 1647 zany
1648 ,</p>
<p>Some mumble-news 1649 , some trencher-knight 1650 , some Dick
1651</p>
<p>That smiles his cheek in years 1652 and knows the trick 1653</p>
<p>To make my lady laugh when she’s disposed 1654 ,</p>
<p>Told our intents before, which once disclosed,</p>
<p>The ladies did change favours and then we,</p>
<p>Following the signs, wooed but the sign of she 1655 .</p>
<p>Now, to our perjury to add more terror,</p>
<p>We are again forsworn in will and error.</p>
<p>Much upon this ’tis 1656 .— And might not you</p>
<p>To Boyet</p>
<p>Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?</p>
<p>Do not you know my lady’s foot by th’squier 1657 ,</p>
<p>And laugh upon the apple 1658 of her eye 1659 ?</p>
<p>And stand between her back, sir, and the fire 1660 ,</p>
<p>Holding a trencher 1661 1662 , jesting merrily?</p>
<p>You put our page out: go, you are allowed.</p>
<p>Die 1663 when you will, a smock 1664 shall be your shroud 1665 .</p>
<p>You leer 1666 upon me, do you? There’s an eye</p>
<p>Wounds like a leaden sword 1667 .</p>
<p>BOYET Full merrily hath this brave manage 1668 , this career 1669 ,
been run.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Lo, he is tilting straight 1670 ! Peace! I have done.</p>
<p>Enter Clown [Costard ]</p>
<p>Welcome, pure wit! Thou partest 1671 a fair fray 1672 .</p>
<p>COSTARD O lord, sir, they would 1673 know</p>
<p>Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.</p>
<p>BEROWNE What, are there but three?</p>
<p>COSTARD No, sir, but it is vara 1674 fine,</p>
<p>For every one pursents 1675 three.</p>
<p>BEROWNE And three times thrice is nine.</p>
<p>COSTARD Not so, sir — under correction, sir — I hope it is not
so.</p>
<p>You cannot beg us 1676 , sir, I can assure you, sir, we know what we
know.</p>
<p>I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir—</p>
<p>BEROWNE Is not nine?</p>
<p>COSTARD Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil 1677 it doth
amount.</p>
<p>BEROWNE By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.</p>
<p>COSTARD O lord, sir, it were pity you should get 1678 your living by
reckoning 1679 , sir.</p>
<p>BEROWNE How much is it?</p>
<p>COSTARD O lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors, sir, will
show whereuntil it doth amount. For mine own part, I am, as they say,
but to perfect 1680 one man in one poor man: Pompion 1681 the Great,
sir.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Art thou one of the Worthies?</p>
<p>COSTARD It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey the Great. For
mine own part, I know not the degree 1682 of the Worthy, but I am to
stand for 1683 him.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Go, bid them prepare.</p>
<p>COSTARD We will turn it finely off 1684 , sir, we will take some
care.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KING Berowne, they will shame us: let them not approach.</p>
<p>BEROWNE We are shame-proof, my lord, and ’tis some policy 1685</p>
<p>To have one show worse than the king’s and his company.</p>
<p>KING I say they shall not come.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Nay, my good lord, let me o’errule you now.</p>
<p>That sport best pleases that doth least know how:</p>
<p>Where zeal 1686 strives to content 1687 and the contents 1688</p>
<p>Dies in the zeal of that which it presents 1689 ,</p>
<p>There form confounded makes most form in mirth 1690</p>
<p>When great things labouring perish in their birth.</p>
<p>BEROWNE A right description of our sport, my lord.</p>
<p>To the King</p>
<p>Enter Braggart [Armado ]</p>
<p>ARMADO Anointed 1691 , I implore so much expense 1692 of thy royal
sweet breath as will utter a brace 1693 of words.</p>
<p>Armado and the</p>
<p>King talk apart</p>
<p>PRINCESS Doth this man serve God?</p>
<p>BEROWNE Why ask you?</p>
<p>PRINCESS He speaks not like a man of God’s making.</p>
<p>ARMADO That’s all one 1694 , my fair, sweet, honey monarch, for, I
protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding fantastical, too too vain, too
too vain. But we will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra 1695
. I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement 1696 !</p>
<p>Gives him a paper,</p>
<p>which the King</p>
<p>looks over</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>KING Here is like 1697 to be a good presence 1698 of Worthies. He
presents Hector of Troy, the swain Pompey the Great, the parish curate
Alexander, Armado’s page</p>
<p>Hercules, the pedant 1699 Judas Maccabaeus.</p>
<p>’And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>These four will change habits 1700 and present the other five.’</p>
<p>BEROWNE There is five in the first show.</p>
<p>KING You are deceived, ’tis not so.</p>
<p>BEROWNE The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest 1701 , the fool
and the boy.</p>
<p>Abate 1702 throw at novum 1703 , and the whole world again</p>
<p>Cannot prick out five such, take each one in’s vein 1704 .</p>
<p>KING The ship is under sail and here she comes amain 1705 .</p>
<p>Enter [Costard as ] Pompey</p>
<p>COSTARD I Pompey am—</p>
<p>BEROWNE You lie, you are not he.</p>
<p>COSTARD I Pompey am—</p>
<p>BOYET With leopard’s head 1706 on knee.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Well said, old mocker, I must needs 1707 be friends with
thee.</p>
<p>COSTARD I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big—</p>
<p>DUMAINE The ‘Great’.</p>
<p>COSTARD It is ‘Great’, sir—</p>
<p>Pompey surnamed the Great,</p>
<p>That oft in field,</p>
<p>With targe 1708 and shield,</p>
<p>Did make my foe to sweat.</p>
<p>And travelling along this coast 1709 , I here am come by chance,</p>
<p>And lay my arms 1710 before the legs of this sweet lass of
France.—</p>
<p>If your ladyship would say, ‘Thanks Pompey’, I had done.</p>
<p>To the Princess</p>
<p>PRINCESS Great thanks, great Pompey.</p>
<p>COSTARD ‘Tis not so much worth, but I hope I was perfect 1711 . I
made a little fault in ’Great’.</p>
<p>BEROWNE My hat to a halfpenny 1712 , Pompey proves the best
Worthy.</p>
<p>Enter Curate [Nathaniel ] for 1713 Alexander</p>
<p>NATHANIEL When in the world I lived, I was the world’s commander:</p>
<p>By east, west, north and south, I spread my conquering might.</p>
<p>My scutcheon 1714 plain declares that I am Alisander—</p>
<p>BOYET Your nose says no, you are not, for it stands too right 1715
.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Your nose smells ‘no’ in this 1716 , most tender-smelling
1717 knight.</p>
<p>PRINCESS The conqueror is dismayed.— Proceed, good Alexander.</p>
<p>NATHANIEL When in the world I lived, I was the world’s commander—</p>
<p>BOYET Most true, ’tis right: you were so, Alisander.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Pompey the Great—</p>
<p>COSTARD Your servant, and Costard.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.</p>
<p>COSTARD O, sir, you have overthrown Alisander the conqueror. You will
be scraped out of the painted cloth 1718 for this. Your lion that holds
his pole-axe 1719 sitting on a close-stool 1720 1721 will be given to
Ajax 1722 . He will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror and afraid to
speak? Run away for shame, Alisander. There, an’t shall please you, a
foolish mild man, an honest man, look you, and soon dashed 1723 . He is
a marvellous good neighbour, in sooth, and a very good bowler. But for
Alisander, alas, you see how ’tis — a little o’erparted 1724 . But there
are Worthies a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort 1725
.</p>
<p>To Nathaniel</p>
<p>Nathaniel</p>
<p>steps back</p>
<p>PRINCESS Stand aside, good Pompey.</p>
<p>Exit [Costard ]</p>
<p>Enter Pedant [Holofernes ] for Judas and the boy [Moth ] for
Hercules</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES Great Hercules is presented by this imp 1726 ,</p>
<p>Whose club killed Cerberus 1727 , that three-headed canus 1728 ,</p>
<p>And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,</p>
<p>Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus 1729 .</p>
<p>Quoniam 1730 he seemeth in minority 1731 ,</p>
<p>Ergo 1732 I come with this apology.—</p>
<p>Keep some state 1733 in thy exit, and vanish.</p>
<p>Exit boy [Moth ]</p>
<p>To moth</p>
<p>Judas I am—</p>
<p>DUMAINE A Judas! 1734</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES Not Iscariot 1735 , sir.</p>
<p>Judas I am, ycliped 1736 Maccabaeus.</p>
<p>DUMAINE Judas Maccabaeus clipped 1737 is plain Judas.</p>
<p>BEROWNE A kissing traitor 1738 . How art thou proved Judas?</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES Judas I am—</p>
<p>DUMAINE The more shame for you, Judas.</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES What mean you 1739 , sir?</p>
<p>BOYET To make Judas hang himself.</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES Begin 1740 , sir: you are my elder 1741 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES I will not be put out of countenance 1742 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE Because thou hast no face.</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES What is this?</p>
<p>Pointing to his face</p>
<p>BOYET A cittern-head 1743 .</p>
<p>DUMAINE The head of a bodkin 1744 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE A death’s face in a ring 1745 .</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen 1746 .</p>
<p>BOYET The pommel 1747 of Caesar’s falchion 1748 .</p>
<p>DUMAINE The carved-bone face on a flask 1749 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE Saint George’s half-cheek 1750 in a brooch.</p>
<p>DUMAINE Ay, and in a brooch of lead.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer 1751 .</p>
<p>And now forward, for we have put thee in countenance 1752 .</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES You have put me out of countenance.</p>
<p>BEROWNE False, we have given thee faces.</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES But you have out-faced them all 1753 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE An thou wert a lion, we would do so.</p>
<p>BOYET Therefore, as he is an ass 1754 , let him go.</p>
<p>And so adieu, sweet Jude. Nay, why dost thou stay?</p>
<p>DUMAINE For the latter end 1755 of his name.</p>
<p>BEROWNE For the ass to the Jude? Give it him: Jud-as, away!</p>
<p>HOLOFERNES This is not generous 1756 , not gentle 1757 , not humble
1758 .</p>
<p>BOYET A light for Monsieur Judas 1759 ! It grows dark, he may
stumble.</p>
<p>Holofernes steps back</p>
<p>PRINCESS Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!</p>
<p>Enter Braggart [Armado as Hector ]</p>
<p>BEROWNE Hide thy head, Achilles. Here comes Hector 1760 in arms 1761
.</p>
<p>DUMAINE Though my mocks come home by me 1762 , I will now be
merry.</p>
<p>KING Hector was but a Troyan 1763 in respect of this.</p>
<p>BOYET But is this Hector?</p>
<p>KING I think Hector was not so clean-timbered 1764 .</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE His leg is too big for Hector.</p>
<p>DUMAINE More calf 1765 , certain.</p>
<p>BOYET No, he is best endued 1766 in the small 1767 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE This cannot be Hector.</p>
<p>DUMAINE He’s a god or a painter, for he makes 1768 faces.</p>
<p>ARMADO The armipotent 1769 Mars, of lances the almighty,</p>
<p>Gave Hector a gift—</p>
<p>DUMAINE A gilt 1770 nutmeg.</p>
<p>BEROWNE A lemon.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE Stuck with cloves.</p>
<p>DUMAINE No, cloven 1771 .</p>
<p>ARMADO The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty</p>
<p>Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion 1772 ;</p>
<p>A man so breathed 1773 that certain he would fight, yea</p>
<p>From morn till night, out of his pavilion 1774 .</p>
<p>I am that flower—</p>
<p>DUMAINE That mint.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE That columbine.</p>
<p>ARMADO Sweet Lord Longaville, rein 1775 thy tongue.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against
Hector.</p>
<p>DUMAINE Ay, and Hector’s a greyhound 1776 .</p>
<p>ARMADO The sweet war-man 1777 is dead and rotten. Sweet chucks, beat
not the bones of the buried 1778 . When we breathed he was a man. But I
will forward 1779 with my device 1780 . Sweet royalty, bestow on me the
sense of hearing.</p>
<p>To the Princess</p>
<p>[Costard ] steps forth</p>
<p>PRINCESS Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.</p>
<p>ARMADO I do adore thy sweet grace’s slipper.</p>
<p>BOYET Loves her by the foot 1781 .</p>
<p>Aside to Dumain</p>
<p>DUMAINE He may not by the yard 1782 .</p>
<p>Aside to Boyet</p>
<p>ARMADO This Hector far surmounted Hannibal.</p>
<p>The party is gone 1783 —</p>
<p>COSTARD Fellow Hector, she is gone 1784 . She is two months on her
way.</p>
<p>ARMADO What meanest thou?</p>
<p>COSTARD Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor wench is
cast away 1785 : she’s quick 1786 , the child brags 1787 in her belly
already. ’Tis yours.</p>
<p>ARMADO Dost thou infamonize 1788 me among potentates 1789 ? Thou
shalt die.</p>
<p>COSTARD Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is quick
1790 by him and hanged for Pompey 1791 that is dead by him.</p>
<p>DUMAINE Most rare Pompey!</p>
<p>BOYET Renowned Pompey!</p>
<p>BEROWNE Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey! Pompey the
Huge!</p>
<p>DUMAINE Hector trembles.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Pompey is moved. More Ates 1792 , more Ates! Stir them, or
stir them on!</p>
<p>DUMAINE Hector will challenge him 1793 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE Ay, if a have 1794 no more man’s blood in’s belly than will
sup 1795 a flea.</p>
<p>ARMADO By the north pole, I do challenge thee.</p>
<p>COSTARD I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man 1796 ; I’ll
slash, I’ll do it by the sword. I pray you let me borrow my arms again
1797 .</p>
<p>DUMAINE Room 1798 for the incensed Worthies.</p>
<p>COSTARD I’ll do it in my shirt.</p>
<p>DUMAINE Most resolute Pompey!</p>
<p>MOTH Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower 1799 . Do you not
see, Pompey is uncasing 1800 for the combat. What mean you? You will
lose your reputation.</p>
<p>To Armado</p>
<p>ARMADO Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me. I will not combat in my
shirt.</p>
<p>DUMAINE You may not deny it. Pompey hath made the challenge.</p>
<p>ARMADO Sweet bloods 1801 , I both may and will.</p>
<p>BEROWNE What reason have you for’t?</p>
<p>ARMADO The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt: I go woolward 1802
for penance.</p>
<p>BOYET True, and it was enjoined 1803 him in Rome for want 1804 of
linen. Since when, I’ll be sworn he wore none but a dishclout 1805 of
Jaquenetta’s, and that he wears next his heart for a favour 1806 .</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger, Monsieur Marcadé 1807</p>
<p>MARCADÉ God save you, madam!</p>
<p>PRINCESS Welcome, Marcadé,</p>
<p>But that thou interrupt’st our merriment.</p>
<p>MARCADÉ I am sorry, madam, for the news I bring is heavy in my
tongue. The king your father—</p>
<p>PRINCESS Dead, for my life!</p>
<p>MARCADÉ Even so: my tale 1808 is told.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Worthies, away! The scene begins to cloud.</p>
<p>ARMADO For mine own part, I breathe free breath 1809 . I have seen
the day of wrong through the little hole of discretion 1810 , and I will
right 1811 myself like a soldier.</p>
<p>Exeunt Worthies</p>
<p>KING How fares your majesty?</p>
<p>PRINCESS Boyet, prepare. I will away tonight.</p>
<p>KING Madam, not so. I do beseech you, stay.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,</p>
<p>For all your fair endeavours, and entreat</p>
<p>Out of a new-sad soul that you vouchsafe</p>
<p>In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide 1812</p>
<p>The liberal 1813 opposition 1814 of our spirits.</p>
<p>If over-boldly we have borne ourselves</p>
<p>In the converse of breath 1815 , your gentleness 1816</p>
<p>Was guilty of 1817 it. Farewell worthy lord!</p>
<p>A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.</p>
<p>Excuse me so 1818 , coming too short of thanks</p>
<p>For my great suit so easily obtained.</p>
<p>KING The extreme parts of time extremely forms</p>
<p>All causes to the purpose of his speed 1819 ,</p>
<p>And often at his very loose 1820 decides</p>
<p>That which long process 1821 could not arbitrate 1822 .</p>
<p>And though the mourning brow of progeny 1823</p>
<p>Forbid 1824 the smiling courtesy of love</p>
<p>The holy suit 1825 which fain 1826 it would convince 1827 ,</p>
<p>Yet, since love’s argument was first on foot 1828 ,</p>
<p>Let not the cloud of sorrow justle 1829 it</p>
<p>From what it purposed: since to wail 1830 friends lost 1831</p>
<p>Is not by much so wholesome-profitable 1832</p>
<p>As to rejoice at friends but newly found.</p>
<p>PRINCESS I understand you not: my griefs are double 1833 .</p>
<p>BEROWNE Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief,</p>
<p>And by these badges 1834 understand the king.</p>
<p>For your fair sakes have we neglected time,</p>
<p>Played foul play 1835 with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,</p>
<p>Hath much deformed 1836 us, fashioning our humours</p>
<p>Even to the opposed end 1837 of our intents.</p>
<p>And what in us hath seemed ridiculous —</p>
<p>As love is full of unbefitting 1838 strains 1839 ,</p>
<p>All wanton 1840 as a child, skipping and vain 1841 ,</p>
<p>Formed by the eye and therefore, like the eye,</p>
<p>Full of straying 1842 shapes 1843 , of habits 1844 and of forms,</p>
<p>Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll</p>
<p>To every varied object in his 1845 glance:</p>
<p>Which parti-coated 1846 presence 1847 of loose 1848 love</p>
<p>Put on 1849 by us, if in your heavenly eyes</p>
<p>Have misbecomed 1850 our oaths and gravities,</p>
<p>Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,</p>
<p>Suggested us to make 1851 . Therefore, ladies,</p>
<p>Our love being yours, the error that love makes</p>
<p>Is likewise yours. We to ourselves prove false 1852</p>
<p>By being once false forever to be true 1853</p>
<p>To those that make us both 1854 — fair ladies, you.</p>
<p>And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,</p>
<p>Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.</p>
<p>PRINCESS We have received your letters full of love,</p>
<p>Your favours, the ambassadors of love,</p>
<p>And in our maiden council rated 1855 them</p>
<p>At 1856 courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,</p>
<p>As bombast 1857 and as lining to the time 1858 .</p>
<p>But more devout 1859 than this in our respects 1860</p>
<p>Have we not been, and therefore met 1861 your loves</p>
<p>In their own fashion, like a merriment.</p>
<p>DUMAINE Our letters, madam, showed much more than jest.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE So did our looks.</p>
<p>ROSALINE We did not quote 1862 them so.</p>
<p>KING Now, at the latest minute of the hour,</p>
<p>Grant us your loves.</p>
<p>PRINCESS A time, methinks, too short</p>
<p>To make a world-without-end 1863 bargain in.</p>
<p>No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,</p>
<p>Full of dear 1864 guiltiness, and therefore this:</p>
<p>If for my love, as 1865 there is no such cause 1866 ,</p>
<p>You will do aught 1867 , this shall you do for me:</p>
<p>Your oath I will not trust, but go with speed</p>
<p>To some forlorn 1868 and naked 1869 hermitage,</p>
<p>Remote from all the pleasures of the world,</p>
<p>There stay until the twelve celestial signs 1870</p>
<p>Have brought about their annual reckoning 1871 .</p>
<p>If this austere insociable 1872 life</p>
<p>Change not your offer made in heat of blood,</p>
<p>If frosts and fasts, hard lodging 1873 and thin weeds 1874</p>
<p>Nip not 1875 the gaudy 1876 blossoms of your love,</p>
<p>But that it bear this trial and last 1877 love,</p>
<p>Then at the expiration 1878 of the year</p>
<p>Come challenge 1879 me, challenge me by these deserts 1880 ,</p>
<p>And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine,</p>
<p>Gives him her hand</p>
<p>I will be thine. And till that instant shut</p>
<p>My woeful self up in a mourning house,</p>
<p>Raining the tears of lamentation</p>
<p>For the remembrance of my father’s death.</p>
<p>If this thou do deny, let our hands part,</p>
<p>Neither entitled in 1881 the other’s heart.</p>
<p>KING If this, or more than this, I would deny,</p>
<p>To flatter up 1882 these powers of mine with rest,</p>
<p>The 1883 sudden hand of death close up mine eye!</p>
<p>Hence, hermit, then — my heart is in thy breast.</p>
<p>BEROWNE // And what to me, my love? And what to me? //</p>
<p>ROSALINE // You must be purgèd too, your sins are rack’d: //</p>
<p>// You are attaint with faults and perjury. //</p>
<p>// Therefore, if you my favour mean to get, //</p>
<p>// A twelvemonth shall you spend and never rest, //</p>
<p>// But seek the weary beds of people sick 1884 . //</p>
<p>DUMAINE But what to me, my love? But what to me?</p>
<p>KATHERINE A wife? A beard, fair health and honesty:</p>
<p>With three-fold love I wish you all these three.</p>
<p>DUMAINE O, shall I say ‘I thank you, gentle wife’?</p>
<p>KATHERINE Not so, my lord. A twelvemonth and a day</p>
<p>I’ll mark no 1885 words that smooth-faced 1886 wooers say.</p>
<p>Come when the king doth to my lady come,</p>
<p>Then if I have much love, I’ll give you some.</p>
<p>DUMAINE I’ll serve thee true and faithfully till then.</p>
<p>KATHERINE Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE What says Maria?</p>
<p>MARIA At the twelvemonth’s end</p>
<p>I’ll change my black gown for a faithful friend 1887 .</p>
<p>LONGAVILLE I’ll stay 1888 with patience, but the time is long.</p>
<p>MARIA The liker 1889 you, few taller 1890 are so young.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Studies 1891 my lady? Mistress, look on me.</p>
<p>Behold the window of my heart, mine eye:</p>
<p>What humble suit attends 1892 thy answer there.</p>
<p>Impose some service on me for thy love.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne,</p>
<p>Before I saw you, and the world’s large tongue 1893</p>
<p>Proclaims you for a man replete with 1894 mocks,</p>
<p>Full of comparisons 1895 and wounding flouts 1896 ,</p>
<p>Which you on all estates 1897 will execute 1898</p>
<p>That lie within the mercy of your wit.</p>
<p>To weed 1899 this wormwood 1900 from your fruitful brain,</p>
<p>And therewithal 1901 to win me, if you please,</p>
<p>Without the which I am not to be won,</p>
<p>You shall this twelvemonth term 1902 from day to day</p>
<p>Visit the speechless sick and still converse 1903</p>
<p>With groaning wretches, and your task shall be</p>
<p>With all the fierce 1904 endeavour of your wit</p>
<p>To enforce 1905 the painèd impotent 1906 to smile.</p>
<p>BEROWNE To move 1907 wild laughter in the throat of death 1908 ?</p>
<p>It cannot be, it is impossible:</p>
<p>Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.</p>
<p>ROSALINE Why, that’s the way to choke a gibing 1909 spirit,</p>
<p>Whose influence is begot of that loose grace 1910</p>
<p>Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools.</p>
<p>A jest’s prosperity 1911 lies in the ear</p>
<p>Of him that hears it, never in the tongue</p>
<p>Of him that makes it. Then, if sickly ears,</p>
<p>Deafed 1912 with the clamours of their own dear 1913 groans,</p>
<p>Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,</p>
<p>And I will have you and that fault withal 1914 .</p>
<p>But if they will not, throw away that spirit,</p>
<p>And I shall find you empty of that fault,</p>
<p>Right joyful of your reformation.</p>
<p>BEROWNE A twelvemonth? Well, befall 1915 what will befall,</p>
<p>I’ll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.</p>
<p>PRINCESS Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take my leave.</p>
<p>To the King</p>
<p>KING No, madam, we will bring 1916 you on your way.</p>
<p>BEROWNE Our wooing doth not end like an old play:</p>
<p>Jack hath not Jill. These ladies’ courtesy 1917</p>
<p>Might well have made our sport a comedy.</p>
<p>KING Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,</p>
<p>And then ’twill end.</p>
<p>BEROWNE That’s too long for a play.</p>
<p>Enter Braggart [Armado ]</p>
<p>ARMADO Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me—</p>
<p>To the King</p>
<p>PRINCESS Was not that Hector?</p>
<p>DUMAINE The worthy knight of Troy.</p>
<p>ARMADO I will kiss thy royal finger and take leave. I am a votary: I
have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the plough 1918 for her sweet love
three years.— But, most esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue
1919 that the two learnèd men 1920 have compiled in praise of the owl
and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the end of our show.</p>
<p>To the Princess</p>
<p>To the King</p>
<p>KING Call them forth quickly: we will do so.</p>
<p>ARMADO Holla! Approach.</p>
<p>Enter all [Holofernes, Nathaniel, Moth, Costard, Jaquenetta and
others. They stand in two groups ]</p>
<p>This side is Hiems, Winter. This Ver, the Spring. The one maintained
1921 by the owl, th’other by the cuckoo. Ver, begin.</p>
<p>[THE SPRING GROUP sings ] the song</p>
<p>When daisies pied 1922 and violets blue</p>
<p>And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue</p>
<p>And lady-smocks 1923 all silver-white</p>
<p>Do paint 1924 the meadows with delight,</p>
<p>The cuckoo then on every tree</p>
<p>Mocks married men 1925 ; for thus sings he:</p>
<p>’Cuckoo,</p>
<p>Cuckoo, cuckoo.’ O word of fear,</p>
<p>Unpleasing to a married ear.</p>
<p>When shepherds pipe on oaten straws 1926</p>
<p>And merry larks are ploughmen’s clocks 1927 ,</p>
<p>When turtles 1928 tread 1929 , and rooks and daws 1930 ,</p>
<p>And maidens bleach their summer smocks,</p>
<p>The cuckoo then, on every tree,</p>
<p>Mocks married men, for thus sings he:</p>
<p>’Cuckoo,</p>
<p>Cuckoo, cuckoo.’ O word of fear,</p>
<p>Unpleasing to a married ear.</p>
<p>[THE WINTER GROUP sings ]</p>
<p>When icicles hang by the wall</p>
<p>And Dick the shepherd blows his nail 1931</p>
<p>And Tom bears logs into the hall</p>
<p>And milk comes frozen home in pail,</p>
<p>When blood is nipped 1932 and ways be foul 1933 ,</p>
<p>Then nightly sings the staring owl:</p>
<p>‘Tu-whit, tu-whoo.’</p>
<p>A merry note,</p>
<p>While greasy 1934 Joan doth keel 1935 the pot.</p>
<p>When all aloud the wind doth blow</p>
<p>And coughing drowns the parson’s saw 1936</p>
<p>And birds sit brooding 1937 in the snow</p>
<p>And Marian’s nose looks red and raw,</p>
<p>When roasted crabs 1938 hiss in the bowl 1939 ,</p>
<p>Then nightly sings the staring owl:</p>
<p>‘Tu-whit, tu-whoo.’</p>
<p>A merry note,</p>
<p>While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.</p>
<p>ARMADO The words of Mercury 1940 are harsh 1941 after the songs of
Apollo 1942 . You 1943 that way; we 1944 this way.</p>
