13</h4>
<p>Enter Emilia alone with two pictures</p>
<p>EMILIA Yet I may bind those wounds up, that must open</p>
<p>And bleed to death for my sake else: I’ll choose,</p>
<p>And end their strife.Two such young handsome men</p>
<p>Shall never fall for me: their weeping mothers,</p>
<p>Following the dead cold ashes of their sons,</p>
<p>Shall never curse my cruelty.</p>
<p>Good heaven,</p>
<p>Looks at one picture</p>
<p>What a sweet face has Arcite! If wise nature,</p>
<p>With all her best endowments, all those beauties</p>
<p>She sows into the births of noble bodies,</p>
<p>Were here a mortal woman and had in her</p>
<p>The coy 1093 denials of young maids, yet, doubtless,</p>
<p>She would run mad for this man: what an eye,</p>
<p>Of what a fiery sparkle and quick 1094 sweetness,</p>
<p>Has this young prince! Here Love himself sits smiling:</p>
<p>Just such another wanton Ganymede 1095</p>
<p>Set Jove afire with and enforced the god</p>
<p>Snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him,</p>
<p>A shining constellation 1096 . What a brow,</p>
<p>Of what a spacious majesty he carries,</p>
<p>Arched like the great-eyed Juno’s, but far sweeter,</p>
<p>Smoother than Pelops’ shoulder 1097 ! Fame and honour,</p>
<p>Methinks, from hence 1098 , as from a promontory 1099</p>
<p>Pointed 1100 in heaven, should clap their wings and sing</p>
<p>To all the underworld 1101 the loves and fights</p>
<p>Of gods and such men near ’em 1102 .</p>
<p>Palamon,</p>
<p>Looks at the other</p>
<p>Is but his foil 1103 , to him, a mere dull shadow:</p>
<p>He’s swart 1104 and meagre 1105 , of an eye as heavy 1106</p>
<p>As if he had lost his mother: a still 1107 temper,</p>
<p>No stirring 1108 in him, no alacrity,</p>
<p>Of all this 1109 sprightly sharpness, not a smile 1110 .</p>
<p>Yet these that we count errors may become him:</p>
<p>Narcissus was a sad 1111 boy, but a heavenly.</p>
<p>O, who can find the bent 1112 of woman’s fancy?</p>
<p>I am a fool, my reason is lost in me,</p>
<p>I have no choice 1113 , and I have lied so lewdly 1114</p>
<p>That women ought to beat me.— On my knees</p>
<p>I ask thy pardon, Palamon: thou art alone</p>
<p>And only 1115 beautiful, and these the eyes,</p>
<p>These the bright lamps of beauty, that command</p>
<p>And threaten love, and what young maid dare cross ’em?</p>
<p>What a bold gravity, and yet inviting,</p>
<p>Has this brown manly face!— O Love, this only,</p>
<p>From this hour, is complexion 1116 !—</p>
<p>Lie there, Arcite:</p>
<p>Sets Arcite’s picture aside</p>
<p>Thou art a changeling 1117 to him, a mere gipsy 1118 ,</p>
<p>And this the noble body.— I am sotted 1119 ,</p>
<p>Utterly lost: my virgin’s faith 1120 has fled me.</p>
<p>For if my brother but even now had asked me</p>
<p>Whether 1121 I loved, I had 1122 run mad for Arcite:</p>
<p>Now if my sister, more for Palamon.</p>
<p>Stand both together.— Now, come ask me, brother.</p>
<p>Alas, I know not.— Ask me now, sweet sister.</p>
<p>I may go look 1123 . What a mere child is fancy,</p>
<p>That, having two fair gauds 1124 of equal sweetness,</p>
<p>Cannot distinguish 1125 , but must cry for both.</p>
<p>Enter Gentleman</p>
<p>EMILIA How now, sir?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN From the noble duke your brother,</p>
<p>Madam, I bring you news: the knights are come.</p>
<p>EMILIA To end the quarrel?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Yes.</p>
<p>EMILIA Would I might end 1126 first!—</p>
<p>What sins have I committed, chaste Diana,</p>
<p>That my unspotted 1127 youth must now be soiled</p>
<p>With blood of princes? And my chastity</p>
<p>Be made the altar where the lives of lovers,</p>
<p>Two greater and two better never yet</p>
<p>Made mothers joy, must be the sacrifice</p>
<p>To my unhappy beauty?</p>
<p>Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous and Attendants</p>
<p>THESEUS Bring ’em in</p>
<p>Quickly, by any means. I long to see ’em.—</p>
<p>Your two contending lovers are returned,</p>
<p>To Emilia</p>
<p>And with them their fair knights. Now, my fair sister,</p>
<p>You must love one of them.</p>
<p>EMILIA I had rather both,</p>
<p>So neither for my sake should fall untimely 1128 .</p>
<p>Enter Messenger</p>
<p>THESEUS Who saw ’em?</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS I a while 1129 .</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN And I.</p>
<p>THESEUS From whence come you, sir?</p>
<p>To the Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER From the knights.</p>
<p>THESEUS Pray speak,</p>
<p>You that have seen them, what they are.</p>
<p>MESSENGER I will, sir,</p>
<p>And truly what I think: six braver spirits</p>
<p>Than these they have brought, if we judge by the outside,</p>
<p>I never saw, nor read of. He that stands</p>
<p>In the first place with Arcite, by his seeming 1130</p>
<p>Should be a stout 1131 man, by his face a prince,</p>
<p>His very looks so say 1132 him: his complexion</p>
<p>Nearer a brown than black, stern, and yet noble,</p>
<p>Which shows him hardy, fearless, proud of dangers.</p>
<p>The circles of his eyes show fire within him,</p>
<p>And as a heated lion, so he looks 1133 .</p>
<p>His hair hangs long behind him, black and shining</p>
<p>Like ravens’ wings, his shoulders broad and strong,</p>
<p>Armed long and round 1134 , and on his thigh a sword</p>
<p>Hung by a curious baldric 1135 , when he frowns</p>
<p>To seal his will with 1136 . Better o’my conscience</p>
<p>Was never soldier’s friend 1137 .</p>
<p>THESEUS Thou hast well described him.</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS Yet a great deal short,</p>
<p>Methinks, of him that’s first with Palamon.</p>
<p>THESEUS Pray speak 1138 him, friend.</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS I guess he is a prince too,</p>
<p>And if it may be, greater, for his show 1139</p>
<p>Has all the ornament of honour in’t.</p>
<p>He’s somewhat bigger than the knight he 1140 spoke of,</p>
<p>But of a face far sweeter: his complexion</p>
<p>Is, as a ripe grape, ruddy. He has felt</p>
<p>Without doubt what he fights for 1141 , and so apter 1142</p>
<p>To make this cause his own. In’s face appears</p>
<p>All the fair hopes of what he undertakes</p>
<p>And when he’s angry, then a settled valour,</p>
<p>Not tainted with extremes 1143 , runs through his body</p>
<p>And guides his arm to brave things. Fear he cannot:</p>
<p>He shows no such soft temper. His head’s yellow,</p>
<p>Hard-haired 1144 , and curled, thick twined like ivy tods 1145 ,</p>
<p>Not to undo 1146 with thunder. In his face</p>
<p>The livery 1147 of the warlike maid 1148 appears,</p>
<p>Pure red and white, for yet no beard has blest him.</p>
<p>And in his rolling eyes sits victory,</p>
<p>As if she ever meant to crown his valour.</p>
<p>His nose stands high, a character 1149 of honour,</p>
<p>His red lips, after fights, are fit for 1150 ladies.</p>
<p>EMILIA Must these men die too?</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS When he speaks, his tongue</p>
<p>Sounds like a trumpet: all his lineaments 1151</p>
<p>Are as a man would wish ’em, strong and clean 1152 .</p>
<p>He wears a well-steeled axe, the staff 1153 of gold.</p>
<p>His age some five-and-twenty.</p>
<p>MESSENGER There’s another,</p>
<p>A little man, but of a tough soul, seeming</p>
<p>As great 1154 as any: fairer promises</p>
<p>In such a body yet I never looked on.</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS O, he that’s freckle-faced?</p>
<p>MESSENGER The same, my lord.</p>
<p>Are they 1155 not sweet 1156 ones?</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS Yes, they are well 1157 .</p>
<p>MESSENGER Methinks,</p>
<p>Being so few and well-disposed, they show</p>
<p>Great and fine art in nature. He’s white-haired 1158 ,</p>
<p>Not wanton white 1159 , but such a manly colour,</p>
<p>Next to an auburn: tough and nimble 1160 set,</p>
<p>Which shows an active soul. His arms are brawny,</p>
<p>Lined with strong sinews: to the shoulder piece,</p>
<p>Gently they swell, like women new-conceived 1161 ,</p>
<p>Which speaks him prone to labour 1162 , never fainting</p>
<p>Under the weight of arms: stout-hearted, still,</p>
<p>But when he stirs, a tiger. He’s grey-eyed 1163 ,</p>
<p>Which yields compassion where he conquers, sharp</p>
<p>To spy advantages, and where he finds ’em,</p>
<p>He’s swift to make ’em his. He does no wrongs,</p>
<p>Nor takes none. He’s round-faced and when he smiles</p>
<p>He shows 1164 a lover, when he frowns, a soldier.</p>
<p>About his head he wears the winner’s oak 1165</p>
<p>And in it stuck the favour of his lady:</p>
<p>His age, some six-and-thirty. In his hand</p>
<p>He bears a charging staff 1166 , embossed 1167 with silver.</p>
<p>THESEUS Are they all thus?</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS They are all the sons of honour.</p>
<p>THESEUS Now, as I have a soul, I long to see ’em.</p>
<p>Lady, you shall see men fight now.</p>
<p>To Hippolyta</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA I wish it,</p>
<p>But not the cause, my lord. They would show</p>
<p>Bravely 1168 about the titles of two kingdoms:</p>
<p>’Tis pity love should be so tyrannous.—</p>
<p>O, my soft-hearted sister, what think you?</p>
<p>Weep not, till they weep blood. Wench, it must be.</p>
<p>THESEUS You have steeled 1169 ’em with your beauty.— Honoured
friend,</p>
<p>To Pirithous</p>
<p>To you I give the field 1170 : pray order it</p>
<p>Fitting the persons that must use it.</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS Yes, sir.</p>
<p>THESEUS Come, I’ll go visit ’em. I cannot stay —</p>
<p>Their fame has fired me so — till they appear.</p>
<p>Good friend, be royal 1171 .</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS There shall want 1172 no bravery 1173 .</p>
<p>EMILIA Poor wench, go weep, for whosoever wins</p>
<p>Loses a noble cousin for thy sins.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
