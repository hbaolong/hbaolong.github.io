<h4 id="scene-1-489-running-scene-5">Scene 1 489 / running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter Menenius with the two Tribunes of the people, Sicinius and
Brutus</p>
<p>MENENIUS The augurer 490 tells me we shall have news tonight.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Good or bad?</p>
<p>MENENIUS Not according to the prayer of the people 491 , for they
love not Martius.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Nature teaches beasts 492 to know their friends.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Pray you, who does the wolf love?</p>
<p>SICINIUS The lamb.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the noble
Martius.</p>
<p>BRUTUS He’s a lamb indeed that baas 493 like a bear.</p>
<p>MENENIUS He’s a bear indeed that lives like a lamb. You two are old
men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.</p>
<p>SICINIUS and BRUTUS Well, sir.</p>
<p>MENENIUS In what enormity 494 is Martius poor in that you two have
not in abundance?</p>
<p>BRUTUS He’s poor in no one fault, but stored 495 with all.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Especially in pride.</p>
<p>BRUTUS And topping all others in boasting.</p>
<p>MENENIUS This is strange now: do you two know how you are censured
496 here in the city, I mean of us o’th’right-hand file 497 ? Do
you?</p>
<p>SICINIUS and BRUTUS Why? How are we censured?</p>
<p>MENENIUS Because you talk of pride now: will you not be angry?</p>
<p>SICINIUS and BRUTUS Well, well, sir, well.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Why, ’tis no great matter 498 : for a very little thief of
occasion 499 will rob you of a great deal of patience: give your
dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures 500 , at the
least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so: you blame
Martius for being proud.</p>
<p>BRUTUS We do it not alone, sir.</p>
<p>MENENIUS I know you can do very little alone, for your helps are
many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single 501 : your
abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone. You talk of pride:
O, that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks 502 ,
and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O, that you
could!</p>
<p>BRUTUS What then, sir?</p>
<p>MENENIUS Why, then you should discover a brace 503 of unmeriting,
proud, violent, testy 504 magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Menenius, you are known well enough too.</p>
<p>MENENIUS I am known to be a humorous 505 patrician, and one that
loves a cup of hot 506 wine with not a drop of allaying 507 Tiber 508
in’t: said to be something imperfect 509 in favouring the first
complaint 510 , hasty and tinder-like 511 upon too trivial motion 512 :
one that converses 513 more with the buttock of the night 514 than with
the forehead of the morning. What I think, I utter, and spend 515 my
malice in my breath 516 . Meeting two such wealsmen 517 as you are — I
cannot call you Lycurguses 518 — if the drink you give me touch my
palate adversely, I make a crooked face at it 519 . I can say your
worships have delivered 520 the matter well, when I find the ass in
compound 521 with the major part of your syllables 522 . And though I
must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men,
yet they lie deadly 523 that tell 524 you have good 525 faces: if you
see this 526 in the map of my microcosm 527 , follows it that I am known
well enough too? What harm can your bisson 528 conspectuities 529 glean
out of this character 530 , if I be known well enough too?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.</p>
<p>MENENIUS You know neither me, yourselves nor anything: you are
ambitious for poor knaves’ caps 531 and legs 532 : you wear out a good
wholesome forenoon 533 in hearing a cause between an orange-wife 534 and
a faucet-seller 535 , and then rejourn 536 the controversy 537 of
threepence to a second day of audience 538 . When you are hearing a
matter between party and party 539 , if you chance to be pinched 540
with the colic, you make faces like mummers 541 , set up the bloody flag
542 against all patience, and in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss the
controversy bleeding 543 , the more entangled by your hearing: all the
peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves. You
are a pair of strange ones.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber
544 for the table 545 than a necessary bencher 546 in the Capitol.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects 547 as you are. When 548 you speak
best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your beards, and
your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher 549
‘s cushion, or to be entombed in an ass’s pack-saddle: yet you must be
saying, ’Martius is proud’, who, in a cheap 550 estimation, is worth all
your predecessors since Deucalion 551 , though peradventure 552 some of
the best of’em were hereditary hangmen. Good e’en 553 to your worships:
more of your conversation would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of
the beastly plebeians.</p>
<p>I will be bold to take my leave of you.</p>
<p>Brutus and Sicinius [stand ] aside</p>
<p>Enter Volumnia, Virgilia and Valeria</p>
<p>How now, my as fair as noble ladies: and the moon 554 , were she
earthly, no nobler: whither do you follow your eyes 555 so fast?</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA Honourable Menenius, my boy Martius approaches: for the love
of Juno 556 , let’s go.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Ha? Martius coming home?</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous approbation
557 .</p>
<p>MENENIUS Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo, Martius coming
home?</p>
<p>He throws up his cap</p>
<p>VIRGILIA and VALERIA Nay, ’tis true.</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA Look, here’s a letter from him: the state hath another, his
wife another, and, I think, there’s one at home for you.</p>
<p>MENENIUS I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for me?</p>
<p>VIRGILIA Yes, certain, there’s a letter for you: I saw’t.</p>
<p>MENENIUS A letter for me? It gives me an estate 558 of seven years’
health, in which time I will make a lip at 559 the physician: the most
sovereign 560 prescription in Galen 561 is but empiricutic 562 , and to
563 this preservative, of no better report 564 than a horse-drench 565 .
Is he not wounded? He was wont 566 to come home wounded.</p>
<p>VIRGILIA O, no, no, no.</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for’t.</p>
<p>MENENIUS So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a 567 victory in
his pocket? The wounds become him.</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA On’s brows 568 : Menenius, he comes the third time home with
the oaken garland.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Has he disciplined 569 Aufidius soundly?</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius got
off.</p>
<p>MENENIUS And ’twas time for him too, I’ll warrant him that: an 570 he
had stayed by him, I would not have been so ’fidiussed 571 for all the
chests in Corioles, and the gold that’s in them. Is the senate possessed
572 of this?</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA Good ladies, let’s go. Yes, yes, yes: the senate has letters
from the general, wherein he gives my son the whole name of 573 the war:
he hath in this action 574 outdone his former deeds doubly.</p>
<p>VALERIA In troth, there’s wondrous things spoke of him.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Wondrous: ay, I warrant you, and not without his true
purchasing 575 .</p>
<p>VIRGILIA The gods grant them true.</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA True? Pow waw! 576</p>
<p>MENENIUS True? I’ll be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded?— God
save your good worships! Martius is coming home: he has more cause to be
proud.— Where is he wounded?</p>
<p>To the Tribunes</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA I’th’shoulder, and i’th’left arm: there will be large
cicatrices 577 to show the people, when he shall stand for his place 578
: he received in the repulse 579 of Tarquin 580 seven hurts
i’th’body.</p>
<p>MENENIUS One i’th’neck, and two i’th’thigh: there’s nine 581 that I
know.</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five wounds upon
him.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Now it’s twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy’s grave.</p>
<p>A shout and flourish</p>
<p>Hark, the trumpets.</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA These are the ushers of Martius: before him he carries
noise, and behind him he leaves tears:</p>
<p>Death, that dark spirit, in’s nervy 582 arm doth lie,</p>
<p>Which being advanced 583 , declines 584 , and then men die.</p>
<p>A sennet 585 . Trumpets sound. Enter Cominius the general, and Titus
Lartius: between them Coriolanus, crowned with an oaken garland with
Captains and Soldiers, and a Herald</p>
<p>HERALD Know, Rome, that all alone Martius did fight</p>
<p>Within Corioles’ gates: where he hath won,</p>
<p>With fame, a name to 586 ‘Martius Caius’:</p>
<p>These in honour follows 587 ‘Coriolanus’.</p>
<p>Welcome to Rome, renownèd Coriolanus!</p>
<p>Sound [a ] flourish</p>
<p>ALL Welcome to Rome, renownèd Coriolanus!</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS No more of this, it does offend my heart:</p>
<p>Pray now, no more.</p>
<p>COMINIUS Look, sir, your mother.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS O, you have, I know, petitioned all the gods</p>
<p>For my prosperity 588 .</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA Nay, my good soldier, up:</p>
<p>He rises</p>
<p>My gentle 589 Martius, worthy Caius,</p>
<p>And by deed-achieving honour 590 newly named:</p>
<p>What is it? ‘Coriolanus’ must I call thee?</p>
<p>But O, thy wife!</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS My gracious 591 silence, hail.</p>
<p>To Virgilia</p>
<p>Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home,</p>
<p>That weep’st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,</p>
<p>Such eyes the widows in Corioles wear,</p>
<p>And mothers that lack sons.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Now the gods crown thee!</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS And live you yet? O my sweet lady, pardon.</p>
<p>To Valeria</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA I know not where to turn. O, welcome home:</p>
<p>And welcome, general, and you’re welcome all.</p>
<p>MENENIUS A hundred thousand welcomes: I could weep</p>
<p>And I could laugh, I am light 592 and heavy: welcome:</p>
<p>A curse begin at very root on’s 593 heart</p>
<p>That is not glad to see thee. You are three</p>
<p>That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,</p>
<p>We have some old crab-trees 594 here at home that will not</p>
<p>Be grafted 595 to your relish 596 . Yet welcome, warriors:</p>
<p>We call a nettle but a nettle and</p>
<p>The faults of fools but folly 597 .</p>
<p>COMINIUS Ever right.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Menenius, ever, ever.</p>
<p>HERALD Give 598 way there, and go on.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Your hand, and yours.</p>
<p>To Volumnia and Virgilia</p>
<p>Ere in our own house I do shade 599 my head,</p>
<p>The good patricians must be visited,</p>
<p>From whom I have received not only greetings,</p>
<p>But with them change of honours 600 .</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA I have lived</p>
<p>To see inherited 601 my very wishes,</p>
<p>And the buildings of my fancy 602 : only</p>
<p>There’s one thing wanting 603 , which I doubt not but</p>
<p>Our Rome will cast 604 upon thee.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Know, good mother,</p>
<p>I had rather be their servant in my way,</p>
<p>Than sway 605 with them in theirs.</p>
<p>COMINIUS On, to the Capitol.</p>
<p>Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state 606 , as before</p>
<p>Enter Brutus and Sicinius</p>
<p>BRUTUS All tongues speak of him, and the blearèd 607 sights</p>
<p>Are spectacled 608 to see him. Your prattling 609 nurse</p>
<p>Into a rapture 610 lets her baby cry</p>
<p>While she chats 611 him: the kitchen malkin 612 pins</p>
<p>Her richest lockram 613 ’bout her reechy 614 neck,</p>
<p>Clamb’ring the walls to eye him: stalls 615 , bulks 616 , windows</p>
<p>Are smothered up, leads 617 filled, and ridges 618 horsed 619</p>
<p>With variable complexions 620 , all agreeing 621</p>
<p>In earnestness to see him: seld-shown 622 flamens 623</p>
<p>Do press among the popular 624 throngs and puff 625</p>
<p>To win a vulgar station 626 : our veiled dames</p>
<p>Commit the war of white and damask 627 in</p>
<p>Their nicely gauded 628 cheeks to th’wanton spoil 629</p>
<p>Of Phoebus’ 630 burning kisses 631 : such a pother 632</p>
<p>As if that whatsoever god who leads him 633</p>
<p>Were slily crept into his human powers 634 635 ,</p>
<p>And gave him graceful posture 636 .</p>
<p>SICINIUS On the sudden 637 , I warrant 638 him consul.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Then our office 639 may, during his power 640 , go sleep.</p>
<p>SICINIUS He cannot temp’rately transport his honours</p>
<p>From where he should begin and end 641 , but will</p>
<p>Lose those he hath won.</p>
<p>BRUTUS In that there’s comfort.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Doubt not</p>
<p>The commoners, for whom we stand 642 , but they</p>
<p>Upon 643 their ancient 644 malice will forget</p>
<p>With the least cause these his new honours, which 645</p>
<p>That he will give them make I as little question</p>
<p>As 646 he is proud to do’t.</p>
<p>BRUTUS I heard him swear,</p>
<p>Were he to stand for consul, never would he</p>
<p>Appear i’th’market-place nor on him put</p>
<p>The napless vesture 647 of humility,</p>
<p>Nor, showing, as the manner is, his wounds</p>
<p>To th’people, beg their stinking breaths 648 .</p>
<p>SICINIUS ’Tis right.</p>
<p>BRUTUS It was his word: O, he would miss it 649 rather</p>
<p>Than carry it but 650 by the suit of the gentry to him,</p>
<p>And the desire of the nobles.</p>
<p>SICINIUS I wish no better</p>
<p>Than have him hold that purpose and to put it</p>
<p>In execution.</p>
<p>BRUTUS ’Tis most like 651 he will.</p>
<p>SICINIUS It shall be to him then, as our good wills 652 :</p>
<p>A sure destruction.</p>
<p>BRUTUS So it must fall out</p>
<p>To him or our authorities for an end 653 .</p>
<p>We must suggest 654 the people in what hatred</p>
<p>He still 655 hath held them: that to’s power he would</p>
<p>Have made them mules 656 , silenced their pleaders 657 ,</p>
<p>And dispropertied 658 their freedoms, holding them,</p>
<p>In human action and capacity 659 ,</p>
<p>Of no more soul nor fitness for the world</p>
<p>Than camels in their war, who have their provand 660</p>
<p>Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows</p>
<p>For sinking under them.</p>
<p>SICINIUS This, as you say, suggested</p>
<p>At some time when his soaring insolence</p>
<p>Shall teach the people — which time shall not want 661 ,</p>
<p>If he be put upon’t 662 , and that’s as easy</p>
<p>As to set dogs on sheep — will be his fire</p>
<p>To kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze</p>
<p>Shall darken 663 him for ever.</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>BRUTUS What’s the matter?</p>
<p>MESSENGER You are sent for to the Capitol: ’tis thought</p>
<p>That Martius shall be consul: I have seen</p>
<p>The dumb men throng to see him and the blind</p>
<p>To hear him speak: matrons 664 flung gloves,</p>
<p>Ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs,</p>
<p>Upon him as he passed: the nobles bended 665</p>
<p>As to Jove 666 ’s statue, and the commons made</p>
<p>A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:</p>
<p>I never saw the like.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Let’s to the Capitol,</p>
<p>And carry with us ears and eyes for th’time 667 ,</p>
<p>But hearts 668 for the event 669 .</p>
