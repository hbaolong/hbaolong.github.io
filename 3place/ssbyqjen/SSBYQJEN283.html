<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-17">Scene 1 / running scene 17</h4>
<p>Enter Clown [Feste ] and Fabian</p>
<p>FABIAN Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.</p>
<p>FESTE Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.</p>
<p>FABIAN Anything.</p>
<p>FESTE Do not desire to see this letter.</p>
<p>FABIAN This is to give a dog and in recompense desire my dog again
1297 .</p>
<p>Enter Duke [Orsino ], Viola, Curio and Lords</p>
<p>ORSINO Belong you to the lady Olivia, friends?</p>
<p>FESTE Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings 1298 .</p>
<p>ORSINO I know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow?</p>
<p>FESTE Truly, sir, the better for 1299 my foes and the worse for my
friends.</p>
<p>ORSINO Just the contrary, the better for thy friends.</p>
<p>FESTE No, sir, the worse.</p>
<p>ORSINO How can that be?</p>
<p>FESTE Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me. Now my foes
tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the
knowledge of myself, and by my friends I am abused 1300 : so that,
conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two
affirmatives 1301 , why then, the worse for my friends and the better
for my foes.</p>
<p>ORSINO Why, this is excellent.</p>
<p>FESTE By my troth, sir, no, though 1302 it please you to be one of my
friends 1303 .</p>
<p>ORSINO Thou shalt not be the worse for me. There’s gold.</p>
<p>Gives a coin</p>
<p>FESTE But 1304 that it would be double-dealing 1305 , sir, I would
you could make it another.</p>
<p>ORSINO O, you give me ill counsel.</p>
<p>FESTE Put your grace 1306 in your pocket 1307 , sir, for this once,
and let your flesh and blood 1308 obey it 1309 .</p>
<p>ORSINO Well, I will be so much a sinner to 1310 be a double-dealer.
There’s another.</p>
<p>Gives another coin</p>
<p>FESTE Primo, secundo, tertio 1311 , is a good play 1312 , and the old
saying is, the third pays for all 1313 . The triplex 1314 , sir, is a
good tripping 1315 measure 1316 , or the bells of Saint Bennet 1317 ,
sir, may put you in mind: one, two, three.</p>
<p>ORSINO You can fool no more money out of me at this throw 1318 . If
you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her
along with you, it may awake my bounty further.</p>
<p>FESTE Marry, sir, lullaby 1319 to your bounty till I come again. I
go, sir. But I would not have you to think that my desire of having is
the sin of covetousness. But as you say, sir, let your bounty take a
nap, I will awake it anon.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Antonio and Officers</p>
<p>VIOLA Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.</p>
<p>ORSINO That face of his I do remember well,</p>
<p>Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmeared</p>
<p>As black as Vulcan 1320 in the smoke of war.</p>
<p>A bawbling 1321 vessel was he captain of,</p>
<p>For 1322 shallow draught 1323 and bulk unprizeable 1324 ,</p>
<p>With which such scathful 1325 grapple 1326 did he make</p>
<p>With the most noble bottom 1327 of our fleet,</p>
<p>That very 1328 envy 1329 and the tongue of loss 1330</p>
<p>Cried fame and honour on him. What’s the matter?</p>
<p>FIRST OFFICER Orsino, this is that Antonio</p>
<p>That took the Phoenix 1331 and her fraught 1332 from Candy 1333 ,</p>
<p>And this is he that did the Tiger 1334 board</p>
<p>When your young nephew Titus lost his leg;</p>
<p>Here in the streets, desperate 1335 of shame and state,</p>
<p>In private brabble 1336 did we apprehend him.</p>
<p>VIOLA He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side 1337 ,</p>
<p>But in conclusion put strange speech upon me 1338 .</p>
<p>I know not what ’twas but distraction 1339 .</p>
<p>ORSINO Notable 1340 pirate! Thou salt-water thief!</p>
<p>What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,</p>
<p>Whom thou, in terms so bloody 1341 and so dear 1342 ,</p>
<p>Hast made thine enemies?</p>
<p>ANTONIO Orsino, noble sir,</p>
<p>Be pleased that I 1343 shake off these names you give me.</p>
<p>Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,</p>
<p>Though I confess, on base 1344 and ground enough,</p>
<p>Orsino’s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither.</p>
<p>That most ingrateful boy there by your side</p>
<p>From the rude 1345 sea’s enraged and foamy mouth</p>
<p>Did I redeem. A wreck past hope he was.</p>
<p>His life I gave him and did thereto add</p>
<p>My love, without retention 1346 or restraint,</p>
<p>All his in dedication 1347 . For his sake</p>
<p>Did I expose myself — pure 1348 for his love —</p>
<p>Into the danger of this adverse 1349 town,</p>
<p>Drew to defend him when he was beset,</p>
<p>Where being apprehended, his false cunning —</p>
<p>Not meaning to partake with me in danger —</p>
<p>Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance 1350 ,</p>
<p>And grew a twenty years removèd thing</p>
<p>While one would wink 1351 , denied me mine own purse,</p>
<p>Which I had recommended 1352 to his use</p>
<p>Not half an hour before.</p>
<p>VIOLA How can this be?</p>
<p>ORSINO When came he to this town?</p>
<p>ANTONIO Today, my lord. And for three months before,</p>
<p>No interim, not a minute’s vacancy,</p>
<p>Both day and night did we keep company.</p>
<p>Enter Olivia and Attendants</p>
<p>ORSINO Here comes the countess. Now heaven walks on earth.</p>
<p>But for 1353 thee, fellow — fellow, thy words are madness.</p>
<p>Three months this youth hath tended upon me.</p>
<p>But more of that anon. Take him aside.</p>
<p>OLIVIA What would my lord, but that he may not have 1354 ,</p>
<p>Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?</p>
<p>Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.</p>
<p>VIOLA Madam?</p>
<p>ORSINO Gracious Olivia—</p>
<p>OLIVIA What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord 1355 —</p>
<p>VIOLA My lord would speak, my duty hushes me.</p>
<p>OLIVIA If it be aught 1356 to the old tune, my lord,</p>
<p>It is as fat 1357 and fulsome 1358 to mine ear</p>
<p>As howling after music.</p>
<p>ORSINO Still so cruel?</p>
<p>OLIVIA Still so constant, lord.</p>
<p>ORSINO What, to perverseness? You uncivil 1359 lady,</p>
<p>To whose ingrate 1360 and unauspicious 1361 altars</p>
<p>My soul the faithfull’st offerings hath breathed out</p>
<p>That e’er devotion tendered 1362 ! What shall I do?</p>
<p>OLIVIA Even what 1363 it please my lord that shall become 1364
him.</p>
<p>ORSINO Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,</p>
<p>Like to th’Egyptian thief 1365 at point of death,</p>
<p>Kill what I love? — a savage jealousy</p>
<p>That sometimes savours nobly 1366 . But hear me this:</p>
<p>Since you to non-regardance 1367 cast my faith,</p>
<p>And that 1368 I partly know the instrument</p>
<p>That screws 1369 me from my true place in your favour,</p>
<p>Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still.</p>
<p>But this your minion 1370 , whom I know you love,</p>
<p>And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender 1371 dearly,</p>
<p>Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,</p>
<p>Where he sits crownèd in his master’s spite 1372 .</p>
<p>Come, boy, with me. My thoughts are ripe in mischief 1373 :</p>
<p>I’ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,</p>
<p>To spite a raven’s heart within a dove.</p>
<p>Starts to leave</p>
<p>VIOLA And I, most jocund 1374 , apt 1375 and willingly,</p>
<p>To do you rest 1376 , a thousand deaths would die.</p>
<p>Starts to leave</p>
<p>OLIVIA Where goes Cesario?</p>
<p>VIOLA After him I love</p>
<p>More than I love these eyes, more than my life,</p>
<p>More, by all mores 1377 , than e’er I shall love wife.</p>
<p>If I do feign, you witnesses above</p>
<p>Punish my life for tainting of 1378 my love!</p>
<p>OLIVIA Ay me, detested! How am I beguiled 1379 !</p>
<p>VIOLA Who does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?</p>
<p>OLIVIA Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?</p>
<p>Call forth the holy father.</p>
<p>[Exit an Attendant ]</p>
<p>ORSINO Come, away!</p>
<p>To Viola</p>
<p>OLIVIA Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.</p>
<p>ORSINO Husband?</p>
<p>OLIVIA Ay, husband. Can he that deny?</p>
<p>ORSINO Her husband, sirrah 1380 ?</p>
<p>VIOLA No, my lord, not I.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Alas, it is the baseness 1381 of thy fear</p>
<p>That makes thee strangle 1382 thy propriety 1383</p>
<p>Fear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up.</p>
<p>Be that 1384 thou know’st thou art, and then thou art</p>
<p>As great as that thou fear’st 1385 .</p>
<p>Enter Priest</p>
<p>O, welcome, father!</p>
<p>Father, I charge thee by thy reverence</p>
<p>Here to unfold 1386 , though lately we intended</p>
<p>To keep in darkness what occasion now</p>
<p>Reveals before ’tis ripe, what thou dost know</p>
<p>Hath newly passed between this youth and me.</p>
<p>PRIEST A contract of eternal bond of love,</p>
<p>Confirmed by mutual joinder 1387 of your hands,</p>
<p>Attested by the holy close 1388 of lips,</p>
<p>Strengthened by interchangement of your rings,</p>
<p>And all the ceremony of this compact 1389</p>
<p>Sealed in my function 1390 , by my testimony.</p>
<p>Since when, my watch 1391 hath told me, toward my grave</p>
<p>I have travelled but two hours.</p>
<p>ORSINO O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be</p>
<p>To Viola</p>
<p>When time hath sowed a grizzle 1392 on thy case 1393 ?</p>
<p>Or will not else thy craft 1394 so quickly grow</p>
<p>That thine own trip 1395 shall be thine overthrow?</p>
<p>Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet</p>
<p>Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.</p>
<p>VIOLA My lord, I do protest 1396 —</p>
<p>OLIVIA O, do not swear!</p>
<p>Hold little faith 1397 , though thou hast too much fear.</p>
<p>Enter Sir Andrew</p>
<p>His head bleeding</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently 1398 to
Sir Toby.</p>
<p>OLIVIA What’s the matter?</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW H’as broke 1399 my head across and has given Sir Toby a
bloody coxcomb 1400 too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather
than forty pound I were at home.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Who has done this, Sir Andrew?</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW The count’s gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for a
coward, but he’s the very devil incardinate 1401 .</p>
<p>ORSINO My gentleman, Cesario?</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW ’Od’s lifelings 1402 , here he is! You broke my head for
nothing, and that that</p>
<p>I did, I was set on to do’t by Sir Toby.</p>
<p>VIOLA Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you.</p>
<p>You drew your sword upon me without cause,</p>
<p>But I bespake you fair, and hurt you not.</p>
<p>Enter Toby and Clown [Feste ]</p>
<p>Sir Toby wounded</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me. I think
you set nothing by 1403 a bloody coxcomb. Here comes Sir Toby halting
1404 . You shall hear more. But if he had not been in drink 1405 , he
would have tickled 1406 you othergates 1407 than he did.</p>
<p>ORSINO How now, gentleman? How is’t with you?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY That’s all one 1408 : h’as hurt me, and there’s th’end on’t
1409 . Sot 1410 , didst see Dick surgeon, sot?</p>
<p>FESTE O, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone 1411 . His eyes were set
1412 at eight i’th’morning.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Then he’s a rogue, and a passy measures pavin 1413 . I hate
a drunken rogue.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?</p>
<p>SIR ANDREW I’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be dressed 1414
together.</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Will you help? An ass-head and a coxcomb 1415 and a knave, a
thin-faced knave, a gull 1416 !</p>
<p>OLIVIA Get him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Feste, Fabian, Sir Toby and Sir Andrew ]</p>
<p>Enter Sebastian</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman.</p>
<p>But, had it been the brother of my blood 1417 ,</p>
<p>I must have done no less with wit and safety 1418 .</p>
<p>You throw a strange regard 1419 upon me, and by that</p>
<p>I do perceive it hath offended you.</p>
<p>Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows</p>
<p>We made each other but so late ago.</p>
<p>ORSINO One face, one voice, one habit 1420 , and two persons,</p>
<p>A natural perspective 1421 , that is and is not!</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Antonio, O my dear Antonio!</p>
<p>How have the hours racked 1422 and tortured me,</p>
<p>Since I have lost thee!</p>
<p>ANTONIO Sebastian are you?</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Fear’st 1423 thou that, Antonio?</p>
<p>ANTONIO How have you made division of yourself?</p>
<p>An apple cleft in two is not more twin</p>
<p>Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?</p>
<p>OLIVIA Most wonderful!</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Do I stand there? I never had a brother,</p>
<p>Sees Viola</p>
<p>Nor can there be that deity 1424 in my nature</p>
<p>Of here and everywhere 1425 . I had a sister,</p>
<p>Whom the blind 1426 waves and surges have devoured.</p>
<p>Of charity 1427 , what kin are you to me?</p>
<p>What countryman? What name? What parentage?</p>
<p>VIOLA Of Messaline. Sebastian was my father,</p>
<p>Such a Sebastian was my brother too,</p>
<p>So went he suited 1428 to his watery tomb.</p>
<p>If spirits can assume both form and suit 1429</p>
<p>You come to fright us.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN A spirit I am indeed,</p>
<p>But am in that dimension grossly clad 1430</p>
<p>Which from the womb I did participate 1431 .</p>
<p>Were you a woman, as the rest goes even 1432 ,</p>
<p>I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,</p>
<p>And say ‘Thrice-welcome, drownèd Viola!’</p>
<p>VIOLA My father had a mole upon his brow.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN And so had mine.</p>
<p>VIOLA And died that day when Viola from her birth</p>
<p>Had numbered thirteen years.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN O, that record 1433 is lively 1434 in my soul!</p>
<p>He finished indeed his mortal act</p>
<p>That day that made my sister thirteen years.</p>
<p>VIOLA If nothing lets 1435 to make us happy both</p>
<p>But this my masculine usurped attire,</p>
<p>Do not embrace me till each circumstance</p>
<p>Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump 1436</p>
<p>That I am Viola — which to confirm,</p>
<p>I’ll bring you to a captain in this town,</p>
<p>Where lie my maiden weeds 1437 , by whose gentle help</p>
<p>I was preserved to serve this noble count.</p>
<p>All the occurrence of my fortune since</p>
<p>Hath been between this lady and this lord.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN So comes it, lady, you have been mistook 1438 .</p>
<p>To Olivia</p>
<p>But nature to her bias drew 1439 in that.</p>
<p>You would have been contracted 1440 to a maid,</p>
<p>Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,</p>
<p>You are betrothed both to a maid and man.</p>
<p>ORSINO Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.—</p>
<p>To Olivia</p>
<p>If this be so, as yet the glass 1441 seems true,</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>I shall have share in this most happy 1442 wreck.—</p>
<p>Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times</p>
<p>To Viola</p>
<p>Thou never shouldst love woman like to 1443 me.</p>
<p>VIOLA And all those sayings will I overswear 1444 ;</p>
<p>And all those swearings keep as true in soul</p>
<p>As doth that orbèd continent 1445 the fire</p>
<p>That severs day from night.</p>
<p>ORSINO Give me thy hand,</p>
<p>And let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds.</p>
<p>VIOLA The captain that did bring me first on shore</p>
<p>Hath my maid’s garments. He upon some action 1446</p>
<p>Is now in durance 1447 , at Malvolio’s suit,</p>
<p>A gentleman, and follower of my lady’s.</p>
<p>OLIVIA He shall enlarge 1448 him. Fetch Malvolio hither.</p>
<p>And yet, alas, now I remember me 1449 ,</p>
<p>They say, poor gentleman, he’s much distract 1450 .</p>
<p>Enter Clown [Feste ] with a letter, and Fabian</p>
<p>A most extracting 1451 frenzy 1452 of mine own</p>
<p>From my remembrance clearly banished his 1453 .</p>
<p>How does he, sirrah?</p>
<p>FESTE Truly, madam, he holds Beelzebub 1454 at the stave’s end 1455
as well as a man in his case may do. H’as here writ a letter to you; I
should have given’t you today 1456 morning, but as a madman’s epistles
1457 are no gospels 1458 , so it skills 1459 not much when they are
delivered 1460 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA Open’t, and read it.</p>
<p>FESTE Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers 1461 the
madman. ‘By the lord, madam’—</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>OLIVIA How now, art thou mad?</p>
<p>FESTE No, madam, I do but read madness. An your ladyship will have it
as it ought to be, you must allow vox 1462 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA Prithee read i’thy right wits.</p>
<p>FESTE So I do, madonna. But to read 1463 his right wits 1464 is to
read thus: therefore perpend 1465 , my princess, and give ear.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Read it you, sirrah.</p>
<p>To Fabian, who takes the letter</p>
<p>FABIAN Reads</p>
<p>’By the lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it.
Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule
over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship. I
have your own letter that induced me to the semblance 1466 I put on;
with the which 1467 I doubt not but to do myself much right, or you much
shame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty 1468 a little
unthought of and speak out of my injury 1469 .</p>
<p>The madly-used Malvolio.’</p>
<p>OLIVIA Did he write this?</p>
<p>FESTE Ay, madam.</p>
<p>ORSINO This savours not much of distraction.</p>
<p>OLIVIA See him delivered 1470 , Fabian, bring him hither.</p>
<p>[Exit Fabian ]</p>
<p>My lord, so 1471 please you, these things further thought on 1472
,</p>
<p>To think me as well a sister as a wife 1473 ,</p>
<p>One day shall crown th’alliance 1474 on’t, so please you,</p>
<p>Here at my house and at my proper 1475 cost.</p>
<p>ORSINO Madam, I am most apt 1476 t’embrace your offer.—</p>
<p>Your master quits 1477 you. And for your service done him,</p>
<p>To Viola</p>
<p>So much against the mettle 1478 of your sex,</p>
<p>So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,</p>
<p>And since you called me master for so long,</p>
<p>Here is my hand 1479 . You shall from this time be</p>
<p>Your master’s mistress.</p>
<p>OLIVIA A sister! You are she.</p>
<p>Enter Malvolio [and Fabian ]</p>
<p>ORSINO Is this the madman?</p>
<p>OLIVIA Ay, my lord, this same.—</p>
<p>How now, Malvolio?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Madam, you have done me wrong,</p>
<p>Notorious wrong.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Have I, Malvolio? No.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.</p>
<p>Hands her the letter</p>
<p>You must not now deny it is your hand.</p>
<p>Write from it 1480 , if you can, in hand or phrase,</p>
<p>Or say ’tis not your seal, not your invention 1481 .</p>
<p>You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,</p>
<p>And tell me, in the modesty of honour 1482 ,</p>
<p>Why you have given me such clear lights 1483 of favour,</p>
<p>Bade me come smiling and cross-gartered to you,</p>
<p>To put on yellow stockings and to frown</p>
<p>Upon Sir Toby and the lighter 1484 people?</p>
<p>And, acting 1485 this in an obedient hope,</p>
<p>Why have you suffered 1486 me to be imprisoned,</p>
<p>Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,</p>
<p>And made the most notorious geck 1487 and gull</p>
<p>That e’er invention played on 1488 ? Tell me why.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,</p>
<p>Though, I confess, much like the character 1489 ,</p>
<p>But out of 1490 question ’tis Maria’s hand.</p>
<p>And now I do bethink me, it was she</p>
<p>First told me thou wast mad; then cam’st 1491 in smiling,</p>
<p>And in such forms which here were presupposed</p>
<p>Upon 1492 thee in the letter. Prithee be content.</p>
<p>This practice 1493 hath most shrewdly 1494 passed 1495 upon thee,</p>
<p>But when we know the grounds and authors of it,</p>
<p>Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge</p>
<p>Of thine own cause.</p>
<p>FABIAN Good madam, hear me speak,</p>
<p>And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come</p>
<p>Taint the condition 1496 of this present hour,</p>
<p>Which I have wondered 1497 at. In hope it shall not,</p>
<p>Most freely I confess, myself and Toby</p>
<p>Set this device against Malvolio here,</p>
<p>Upon 1498 some stubborn and uncourteous 1499 parts 1500</p>
<p>We had conceived against 1501 him. Maria writ</p>
<p>The letter at Sir Toby’s great importance 1502 ,</p>
<p>In recompense whereof he hath married her.</p>
<p>How with a sportful 1503 malice it was followed 1504 ,</p>
<p>May rather pluck on 1505 laughter than revenge,</p>
<p>If that 1506 the injuries be justly weighed</p>
<p>That have on both sides passed.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled 1507 thee!</p>
<p>FESTE Why, ‘Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
have greatness thrown upon them.’ I was one, sir, in this interlude 1508
; one Sir Topas, sir, but that’s all one. ‘By the Lord, fool, I am not
mad.’ But do you remember? Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal?
An you smile not, he’s gagged.’ And thus the whirligig 1509 of time
brings in his revenges.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO I’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>OLIVIA He hath been most notoriously abused.</p>
<p>ORSINO Pursue him and entreat him to a peace.</p>
<p>He hath not told us of the captain yet.</p>
<p>When that is known and golden 1510 time convents 1511 ,</p>
<p>A solemn combination 1512 shall be made</p>
<p>Of our dear souls.— Meantime, sweet sister,</p>
<p>We will not part from hence 1513 .— Cesario, come —</p>
<p>For so you shall be, while you are a man.</p>
<p>But when in other habits 1514 you are seen,</p>
<p>Orsino’s mistress and his fancy’s 1515 queen.</p>
<p>Exeunt [all, except Feste ]</p>
<p>FESTE Sings</p>
<p>When that I was and a 1516 little tiny boy,</p>
<p>With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</p>
<p>A foolish 1517 thing 1518 was but a toy 1519 ,</p>
<p>For the rain it raineth every day.</p>
<p>But when I came to man’s estate 1520 ,</p>
<p>With hey, ho, etc 1521 .</p>

<p>But when I came, alas! to wive 1522 ,</p>
<p>With hey, ho, etc.</p>
<p>By swaggering 1523 could I never thrive,</p>

<p>But when I came unto my beds 1524 ,</p>
<p>With hey, ho, etc.</p>
<p>With toss-pots 1525 still had drunken heads,</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain) . Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster, and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside ?(often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading’bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
