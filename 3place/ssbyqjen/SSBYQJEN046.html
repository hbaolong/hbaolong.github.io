<h4 id="introduction-to-the-merry-wives-of-windsor">Introduction to The
Merry Wives of Windsor</h4>
<p>In 1702 the poet and critic John Dennis rewrote The Merry Wives of
Windsor with the title The Comical Gallant: or, the Amours of Sir John
Falstaff . Dennis claimed that the original Shakespearean play was a
particular favourite of Queen Elizabeth. Indeed, he reported, ‘This
comedy was written at her command, and by her direction, and she was so
eager to see it acted that she commanded it to be finished in fourteen
days; and was afterwards, as tradition tells us, very well pleased at
the representation.’ A few years later, the story was elaborated in the
biography appended to Nicholas Rowe’s edition of Shakespeare: the Queen
was so well pleased ‘with that admirable character of Falstaff in the
two parts of Henry the Fourth’ that she commanded Shakespeare ‘to
continue it for one play more, and to show him in love’.</p>
<p>We do not know whether the story is true, but there is great appeal
in the idea of Falstaff reincarnated by royal command and transposed
from tavern and battlefield to lady’s chamber and linen basket. There is
no doubt that the play’s popularity on the eighteenth- and
nineteenth-century stage owed much to its status as a vehicle for
Falstaff. And at the end of the nineteenth century, the drama underwent
another transposition as it was recreated in perhaps the greatest of all
Shakespearean operas, Verdi and Boito’s Falstaff .</p>
<p>A seventeenth-century educational theorist called Philip King
complained that it was ridiculous to suggest that ‘the condition of all
our English women may be drawn out of Shakespeare’s The Merry Wives of
Windsor’. And in the 1660s, the leading English female intellectual of
the age, Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, singled out those
wives as particularly strong examples of Shakespeare’s gift for
representing women: ‘who could describe Cleopatra better than he hath
done, and many other females to his own creating, as Nan Page, Mrs Page,
Mrs Ford, the Doctor’s Maid, Beatrice, Mrs Quickly, Doll Tearsheet, and
others, too many to relate?’ Though King disapproved and the Duchess
approved, they clearly agreed that The Merry Wives was one of
Shakespeare’s best plays for women. Whereas Shakespeare’s other comedies
are courtship dramas that end with weddings or the promise of them, The
Merry Wives of Windsor is more interested in how witty wives sustain
society. The play is Shakespeare’s nearest approach to sitcom, where the
setting is domestic and people are forever rushing in and out of
doors.</p>
<p>‘The Merry Wives’ indicates that this is a play in which the women
will be on top. ‘Of Windsor’ promises a comedy of English town life.
This is in sharp contrast to Shakespeare’s other comedies of the late
1590s and early 1600s, with their courtly, continental and often
pastoral settings. Indeed, with the exception of the Eastcheap scenes in
the Henry IV plays, Windsor is the closest Shakespeare comes to the one
major dramatic genre of the age which he did not attempt: the comedy of
London life. City comedy was the forte of the group of slightly younger
dramatists who came onto the theatre scene around the turn of the
century – Ben Jonson, Thomas Dekker and Thomas Middleton.</p>
<p>But Windsor is not London. Though the play includes several types
familiar from city comedy – the jealous husband, the marriageable
citizen’s daughter, the simpleton up from the country – the setting is
more provincial town than buzzing metropolis. The dramatist’s own
experience of life in Stratford-upon-Avon was probably a more formative
influence on the creation of this play than any literary source of the
kind that inspired most of his other comedies. The scene in which a
cheeky boy called William is drilled in Latin grammar feels as close to
autobiographical reminiscence as anything in Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Nor is Windsor a generic English town. The castle and the royal park
made it synonymous with the monarchy. During the closing nocturnal scene
in the park, Mistress Quickly in the role of Queen of the Fairies offers
a good luck charm to Queen Elizabeth, whom the poet Edmund Spenser had
immortalized a few years before under the guise of England’s Faerie
Queene . Given its royal setting, its close relationship to the history
plays and the fact that it is the only Shakespearean comedy with an
English setting, The Merry Wives is inevitably interested in questions
of Englishness. The comic treatment of honour and cozening, true and
false knighthood, and the nature of gentility rearticulates some of the
matter of the Henry IV plays in a new key, but the most sustained
exploration of national identity takes place at the level of
language.</p>
<p>Shakespeare has always been so admired for his poetry that the
language of The Merry Wives has often been underrated for the simple
reason that of all his plays this is the one with the highest proportion
of prose. Yet its command of the prose medium is unstoppable: from first
to last there is a stream of wordplay, innuendo and hilarious linguistic
misapprehension. The comic suitors are the key here: the Welsh parson
Sir Hugh Evans and the French Doctor Caius are characterized by their
abuse of the English language. Extraordinary mileage is obtained from
Caius’ verbal tics (‘By gar’, ‘vat is?’) and such simple substitutions
as Evans’ ‘f’ for ‘v’ (thus in the Latin language lesson, the
grammatical term ‘vocative’ becomes the obscene-sounding ‘focative’).
Verbal sparring stands in for physical. Whereas in the history plays
national pride comes from prowess at arms, here it is a matter of
prowess at words. When the Welshman and the Frenchman prepare to fight a
duel over their rivalry for Anne, Shallow and Page remove their swords
and the Host says ‘Let them keep their limbs whole and hack our
English.’</p>
<p>Comedy at the expense of foreigners for their abuse of the English
tongue might be described as crudely patriotic or mildly xenophobic. A
deeper patriotism and a richer form of comedy come from the capacity of
the English language to turn adversity to advantage. That is the art of
Falstaff, as it is in a more general sense the art of Shakespeare and
his actors. Falstaff is repeatedly humiliated, but his mastery of the
English language always gives him the last word. On discovering that he
has been pinched and beaten not by real goblins but by Sir Hugh and his
class of children, Falstaff magnificently retorts ‘Have I lived to stand
at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English?’ and then ‘I am not
able to answer the Welsh flannel.’ He is physically humiliated
(‘dejected’), but his linguistic gift never fails. Like his creator, he
can seemingly conjure anything into language. Again and again, a bodily
battering is transformed into the opportunity for a verbal display in
which a tone of feigned incredulity creates a unique combination of
excess and humility, self-delusion and self-knowledge that is
irresistible to a theatre audience.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Sir John Falstaff, staying in Windsor and down on his luck,
decides to restore his fortunes by seducing the wives of two wealthy
citizens. He sends Mistress Page and Mistress Ford identical love
letters, but they discover his double dealing and set about turning the
tables, arranging an assignation at Mistress Ford’s house. The jealous
Frank Ford has heard of Falstaff’s plan and decides to test his wife’s
fidelity. Pretending to be Master Broom, he pays Falstaff to seduce his
wife on his behalf, twice almost catching them together. The Pages’
daughter Anne is pursued by three suitors. The French physician Doctor
Caius is her mother’s choice, whilst her father favours Slender, Justice
Shallow’s kinsman. Anne herself is in love with Fenton. Mistress Quickly
is being paid by all three suitors to advance their cause. A duel
between Doctor Caius and Parson Evans is averted when the Host of the
Garter Inn plays a trick on them, and they in turn pay him back. In
Windsor Great Park at night, Falstaff is set up for his final punishment
– and one of Anne Page’s suitors is successful.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Falstaff (17%/136/9), Mrs Page (12%/101/9), Ford (12%/99/9), Mrs
Quickly (10%/74/9), Evans (8%/87/9), Mrs Ford (6%/85/7), Page
(6%/75/11), Slender (5%/56/7), Shallow (4%/59/7), Caius (4%/49/8), Host
(4%/46/8), Fenton (4%/20/4), Pistol (2%/29/5), Simple (2%/25/5), Anne
Page (1%/19/3).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 10% verse, 90% prose. Highest proportion of prose
in the Complete Works .</p>
<p>DATE: 1597–1601. Allusion to the Order of the Garter in the final
scene has led to supposition that the play was performed at, or indeed
commissioned for, the Garter Feast held at Whitehall in April 1597, when
George Carey, Lord Chamberlain and patron of Shakespeare’s acting
company, was elected to the order, as (in absentia ) was Frederick Duke
of Württemberg (which may account for the allusions to a German duke in
the scene involving the Host’s horses). The 1597–98 winter season at
court and the Garter festivities for 1599 have also been proposed as the
occasion: the argument for the latter, when Henry Brooke, eighth Lord
Cobham, was elected Knight of the Garter, is interwoven with the
Brooke/Broom crux (see ‘Text’, below). The argument against 1597 is that
it would place the play before 2 Henry IV , which seems
counter-intuitive: the relationship between Falstaff and Shallow,
together with the retinue of ‘irregular humorists’, is more likely to
have been created in the history play and reanimated in the comedy than
vice versa (though it has been suggested that The Merry Wives was dashed
off when Shakespeare was halfway through the writing of 2 Henry IV ).
The element of ‘humoral’ comedy suggests a date after Ben Jonson
introduced this vogue in Every Man in his Humour (1598). The argument
against a special Garter commission is that a full-length comedy, as
opposed to a shorter masque or entertainment of a more courtly kind, is
unlikely to have been performed on such an occasion. It is possible that
the Garter dimension is a vestige of an earlier commissioned work that
was expanded into a comedy for the public stage. The play is not
mentioned by Meres, suggesting late 1598 or 1599 as the earliest date
for public performance. The 1602 Quarto title page clearly indicates
performance both before the court and in the public theatre. Quarto
omits the speech alluding to the Order of the Garter and many other
references to Windsor and the court. The major differences between
Quarto and Folio texts (see below) suggest several stages of composition
and probably performance in different versions.</p>
<p>SOURCES: No known source for the main plot, but the gallant who
attempts to seduce another man’s wife, is interrupted and hidden in a
bizarre place was a traditional comic motif, as was the clever wife who
gets the upper hand (there is an example in one of the tales in Barnabe
Riche’s Farewell to Military Profession , a book that provided
Shakespeare with the main source for Twelfth Night ); the Anne Page plot
of rival suitors for an attractive daughter also has many analogues. The
horse-stealing episode may allude to the Duke of Württemberg’s visit to
England in 1592 and has parallels with a comic sequence in Marlowe’s Dr
Faustus . Falstaff with his horns in the park combines the folk-tale of
Herne the Hunter with the classical myth (from Ovid’s Metamorphoses ) of
Actaeon. The pinching Fairies are themselves pinched from act four scene
three of John Lyly’s play Endymion, the Man in the Moon (published
1591).</p>
<p>TEXT: Published in Quarto in 1602, in a version that has the
hallmarks of a ‘reported text’ of a stage production. About half the
length of the Folio, and with many textual corruptions, the Quarto was
reprinted in 1619. The First Folio text of 1623 was set from a
transcript by Ralph Crane, professional scribe to the King’s Men, though
it is not certain whether he worked from the playhouse ‘book’ or an
authorial manuscript.</p>
<p>The Quarto calls into question two significant details in the Folio.
First, the name by which Ford calls himself when disguised: this is
‘Brooke’ in Quarto but ‘Broom’ in Folio. ‘Brooke’ was clearly
Shakespeare’s original intention, being an aquatic variation on ‘Ford’
and the occasion for at least one liquid pun (‘Such Brooks are welcome
to me, that o’erflows such liquor’ – 2.2.107). The change to ‘Broom’ in
Folio may well have been made in order to avoid offending the powerful
family with whom Shakespeare had already been in trouble over a name in
1 Henry IV . Lord Cobham had objected to the name Sir John Oldcastle,
with the result that Shakespeare changed it to Sir John Falstaff. The
Cobham family name was Brooke, so perhaps they intervened again, or the
name was changed for fear that they might. We follow Folio’s Broom, but
in production it is probably best to revert to Brook, in order to make
the watery jokes work. Falstaff does not, after all, hide in a broom
cupboard: he is thrown into a brook.</p>
<p>The other issue is the colour coding at the climactic moment of the
play, when Anne’s three suitors come on and take the fairy each of them
supposes is her, whilst the children are singing their song and pinching
Falstaff. In Folio, Master Page tells Slender that his daughter will be
in white, but when Slender comes on with the humiliating news that he
has grabbed and married a boy, he says that he took a fairy in green.
With Caius, it is the other way round: Mistress Page tells him that Anne
will be in green, but he takes a boy in white. Editors since the
eighteenth century have reversed the colours in the dialogue at the end,
to make them consistent with those of the initial plan. Since the
inconsistency is much more likely to be the author’s than the printer’s,
we have not done this, but attention is drawn to this issue in the gloss
and the textual notes.</p>
