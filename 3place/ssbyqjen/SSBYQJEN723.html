10</h4>
<p>Enter the Archbishop, Mowbray, Hastings</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK What is this forest called?</p>
<p>HASTINGS ’Tis Gaultree Forest 1115 , an’t 1116 shall please your
grace.</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Here stand, my lords, and send discoverers 1117
forth</p>
<p>To know the numbers of our enemies.</p>
<p>HASTINGS We have sent forth already.</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK ’Tis well done.</p>
<p>My friends and brethren in these great affairs,</p>
<p>I must acquaint you that I have received</p>
<p>New-dated 1118 letters from Northumberland.</p>
<p>Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:</p>
<p>Here doth he wish his person, with such powers 1119</p>
<p>As might hold sortance with 1120 his quality 1121 ,</p>
<p>The which he could not levy 1122 , whereupon</p>
<p>He is retired 1123 , to ripe 1124 his growing fortunes,</p>
<p>To Scotland; and concludes in hearty prayers</p>
<p>That your attempts may overlive 1125 the hazard</p>
<p>And fearful meeting of their opposite 1126 .</p>
<p>MOWBRAY Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground 1127</p>
<p>And dash themselves to pieces.</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>HASTINGS Now, what news?</p>
<p>MESSENGER West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,</p>
<p>In goodly form 1128 comes on the enemy.</p>
<p>And by the ground they hide, I judge their number</p>
<p>Upon or near the rate 1129 of thirty thousand.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY The just proportion that we gave them out 1130 .</p>
<p>Let us sway on 1131 and face them in the field.</p>
<p>Enter Westmorland</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK What well-appointed 1132 leader fronts 1133 us
here?</p>
<p>MOWBRAY I think it is my lord of Westmorland.</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Health and fair greeting from our general,</p>
<p>The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster 1134 .</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Say on, my lord of Westmorland, in peace:</p>
<p>What doth concern your coming 1135 ?</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Then, my lord,</p>
<p>Unto your grace do I in chief address</p>
<p>The substance of my speech. If that 1136 rebellion</p>
<p>Came like itself 1137 , in base and abject routs 1138 ,</p>
<p>Led on by bloody 1139 youth, guarded 1140 with rage,</p>
<p>And countenanced 1141 by boys and beggary,</p>
<p>I say, if damned commotion 1142 so appeared,</p>
<p>In his true, native and most proper 1143 shape,</p>
<p>You, reverend 1144 father, and these noble lords</p>
<p>Had not 1145 been here to dress 1146 the ugly form</p>
<p>Of base and bloody insurrection</p>
<p>With your fair honours 1147 . You, lord archbishop,</p>
<p>Whose see 1148 is by a civil peace maintained,</p>
<p>Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touched,</p>
<p>Whose learning and good letters 1149 peace hath tutored,</p>
<p>Whose white investments 1150 figure 1151 innocence,</p>
<p>The dove and very blessèd spirit of peace,</p>
<p>Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself</p>
<p>Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,</p>
<p>Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war,</p>
<p>Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,</p>
<p>Your pens to lances and your tongue divine</p>
<p>To a loud trumpet and a point 1152 of war?</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.</p>
<p>Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,</p>
<p>And with our surfeiting and wanton 1153 hours</p>
<p>Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,</p>
<p>And we must bleed 1154 for it, of which disease</p>
<p>Our late King Richard, being infected, died.</p>
<p>But, my most noble lord of Westmorland,</p>
<p>I take not on me 1155 here as a physician,</p>
<p>Nor do I as an enemy to peace</p>
<p>Troop in the throngs of military men,</p>
<p>But rather show 1156 awhile like fearful war,</p>
<p>To diet rank 1157 minds sick of happiness</p>
<p>And purge th’obstructions which begin to stop</p>
<p>Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</p>
<p>I have in equal balance justly 1158 weighed</p>
<p>What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</p>
<p>And find our griefs 1159 heavier than our offences.</p>
<p>We see which way the stream of time doth run,</p>
<p>And are enforced from our most quiet there 1160</p>
<p>By the rough torrent of occasion,</p>
<p>And have the summary of all our griefs,</p>
<p>When time shall serve, to show in articles 1161 ;</p>
<p>Which long ere this we offered to the king,</p>
<p>And might by no suit 1162 gain our audience 1163 .</p>
<p>When we are wronged and would unfold 1164 our griefs,</p>
<p>We are denied access unto his person</p>
<p>Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</p>
<p>The dangers of the days but newly gone 1165 ,</p>
<p>Whose memory is written on the earth 1166</p>
<p>With yet appearing 1167 blood, and the examples</p>
<p>Of every minute’s instance 1168 , present now,</p>
<p>Hath put us in these ill-beseeming 1169 arms,</p>
<p>Not to break peace or any branch of it,</p>
<p>But to establish here a peace indeed,</p>
<p>Concurring both in name and quality.</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Whenever yet was your appeal denied?</p>
<p>Wherein have you been gallèd 1170 by the king?</p>
<p>What peer hath been suborned 1171 to grate on 1172 you,</p>
<p>That you should seal 1173 this lawless bloody book</p>
<p>Of forged rebellion with a seal divine?</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK My brother general, the commonwealth 1174 ,</p>
<p>I make my quarrel in particular.</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND There is no need of any such redress,</p>
<p>Or if there were, it not belongs to you.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY Why not to him in part, and to us all</p>
<p>That feel the bruises of the days before,</p>
<p>And suffer the condition of these times</p>
<p>To lay a heavy and unequal 1175 hand</p>
<p>Upon our honours?</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND O, my good lord Mowbray,</p>
<p>Construe 1176 the times to their necessities 1177 ,</p>
<p>And you shall say indeed, it is the time,</p>
<p>And not the king, that doth you injuries.</p>
<p>Yet for your part, it not appears 1178 to me</p>
<p>Either from the king or in the present time</p>
<p>That you should have an inch of any ground</p>
<p>To build a grief on. Were you not restored</p>
<p>To all the Duke of Norfolk’s signories 1179 ,</p>
<p>Your noble and right well rememb’red father’s?</p>
<p>MOWBRAY What thing, in honour, had my father lost,</p>
<p>That need to be revived and breathed 1180 in me?</p>
<p>The king that loved him, as the state 1181 stood then,</p>
<p>Was force perforce 1182 compelled to banish him 1183 ,</p>
<p>And then that Henry Bullingbrook and he,</p>
<p>Being mounted and both rousèd 1184 in their seats,</p>
<p>Their neighing coursers 1185 daring of the spur 1186 ,</p>
<p>Their armèd staves in charge 1187 , their beavers 1188 down,</p>
<p>Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel 1189</p>
<p>And the loud trumpet blowing them together 1190 ,</p>
<p>Then, then, when there was nothing could have stayed 1191</p>
<p>My father from the breast of Bullingbrook,</p>
<p>O, when the king did throw his warder 1192 down —</p>
<p>His own life hung upon the staff he threw —</p>
<p>Then threw he down himself and all their lives 1193</p>
<p>That by indictment 1194 and by dint of sword 1195</p>
<p>Have since miscarried 1196 under Bullingbrook.</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.</p>
<p>The Earl of Hereford 1197 was reputed then</p>
<p>In England the most valiant gentleman.</p>
<p>Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?</p>
<p>But if your father had been victor there,</p>
<p>He ne’er had borne it out of Coventry 1198 ,</p>
<p>For all the country in a general voice</p>
<p>Cried hate upon him, and all their prayers and love</p>
<p>Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on</p>
<p>And blessed and graced and did 1199 more than the king —</p>
<p>But this is mere digression from my purpose.</p>
<p>Here come I from our princely general</p>
<p>To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace</p>
<p>That he will give you audience, and wherein 1200</p>
<p>It shall appear that your demands are just,</p>
<p>You shall enjoy them 1201 , everything set off 1202 ,</p>
<p>That might so much as think you 1203 enemies.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY But he hath forced us to compel 1204 this offer,</p>
<p>And it proceeds from policy 1205 , not love.</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Mowbray, you overween 1206 to take it so.</p>
<p>This offer comes from mercy, not from fear.</p>
<p>For, lo, within a ken 1207 our army lies,</p>
<p>Upon mine honour, all too confident</p>
<p>To give admittance to a thought of fear.</p>
<p>Our battle 1208 is more full of names 1209 than yours,</p>
<p>Our men more perfect 1210 in the use of arms,</p>
<p>Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;</p>
<p>Then reason will 1211 our hearts should be as good.</p>
<p>Say you not then our offer is compelled.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY Well, by my will, we shall admit no parley 1212 .</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND That argues but the shame of your offence:</p>
<p>A rotten case abides no handling 1213 .</p>
<p>HASTINGS Hath the Prince John a full commission,</p>
<p>In very ample virtue 1214 of his father,</p>
<p>To hear and absolutely to determine</p>
<p>Of 1215 what conditions we shall stand upon?</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND That is intended 1216 in the general’s name 1217 .</p>
<p>I muse 1218 you make so slight a question.</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Then take, my lord of Westmorland, this schedule
1219 ,</p>
<p>Gives paper</p>
<p>For this contains our general grievances:</p>
<p>Each several article 1220 herein redressed,</p>
<p>All members of our cause, both here and hence 1221 ,</p>
<p>That are insinewed to 1222 this action,</p>
<p>Acquitted 1223 by a true substantial form 1224</p>
<p>And present execution of our wills</p>
<p>To us and to our purposes confined 1225 ,</p>
<p>We come within our awful banks 1226 again</p>
<p>And knit 1227 our powers to the arm of peace.</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND This will I show the general. Please you 1228 ,
lords,</p>
<p>In sight of both our battles 1229 we may meet,</p>
<p>At either end 1230 in peace, which heaven so frame 1231 ,</p>
<p>Or to the place of difference call the swords</p>
<p>Which must decide it.</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK My lord, we will do so.</p>
<p>[Exit Westmorland ]</p>
<p>MOWBRAY There is a thing within my bosom tells me</p>
<p>That no conditions of our peace can stand.</p>
<p>HASTINGS Fear you not that. If we can make our peace</p>
<p>Upon such large terms and so absolute 1232</p>
<p>As our conditions shall consist upon 1233 ,</p>
<p>Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY Ay, but our valuation 1234 shall be such</p>
<p>That every slight and false-derivèd 1235 cause,</p>
<p>Yea, every idle, nice and wanton 1236 reason</p>
<p>Shall to the king taste of this action,</p>
<p>That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love 1237 ,</p>
<p>We shall be winnowed 1238 with so rough a wind</p>
<p>That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff</p>
<p>And good from bad find no partition 1239 .</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK No, no, my lord. Note this: the king is weary</p>
<p>Of dainty 1240 and such picking 1241 grievances,</p>
<p>For he hath found to end one doubt 1242 by death</p>
<p>Revives two greater in the heirs of life 1243 ,</p>
<p>And therefore will he wipe his tables 1244 clean</p>
<p>And keep no tell-tale to his memory</p>
<p>That may repeat and history 1245 his loss</p>
<p>To new remembrance. For full well he knows</p>
<p>He cannot so precisely 1246 weed this land</p>
<p>As his misdoubts 1247 present occasion 1248 :</p>
<p>His foes are so enrooted 1249 with his friends</p>
<p>That, plucking to unfix an enemy,</p>
<p>He doth unfasten so and shake a friend,</p>
<p>So that this land, like an offensive wife</p>
<p>That hath enraged him on 1250 to offer strokes,</p>
<p>As he is striking, holds his infant up</p>
<p>And hangs resolved correction 1251 in the arm</p>
<p>That was upreared to execution 1252 .</p>
<p>HASTINGS Besides, the king hath wasted 1253 all his rods 1254</p>
<p>On late 1255 offenders, that he now doth lack</p>
<p>The very instruments of chastisement,</p>
<p>So that his power, like to a fangless lion,</p>
<p>May offer 1256 , but not hold.</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK ’Tis very true,</p>
<p>And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,</p>
<p>If we do now make our atonement 1257 well,</p>
<p>Our peace will, like a broken limb united,</p>
<p>Grow stronger for the breaking.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY Be it so.</p>
<p>Here is returned my lord of Westmorland.</p>
<p>Enter Westmorland</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND The prince is here at hand. Pleaseth your lordship</p>
<p>To meet his grace just 1258 distance ’tween our armies.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY Your grace of York, in heaven’s name then forward.</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Before 1259 , and greet his grace.— My lord, we
come.</p>
<p>Enter Prince John [and Attendants ]</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN You are well encountered here, my cousin 1260
Mowbray.—</p>
<p>Good day to you, gentle 1261 lord archbishop.—</p>
<p>And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.—</p>
<p>My lord of York, it better showed with you 1262</p>
<p>When that your flock, assembled by the bell,</p>
<p>Encircled you to hear with reverence</p>
<p>Your exposition on the holy text</p>
<p>Than now to see you here an iron 1263 man,</p>
<p>Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,</p>
<p>Turning the word 1264 to sword and life to death.</p>
<p>That man that sits within a monarch’s heart,</p>
<p>And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,</p>
<p>Would he 1265 abuse the countenance 1266 of the king,</p>
<p>Alack, what mischiefs might he set abroach 1267</p>
<p>In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,</p>
<p>It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken</p>
<p>How deep you were within the books of heaven 1268 ?</p>
<p>To us, the speaker 1269 in his parliament;</p>
<p>To us, th’imagined voice of heaven itself,</p>
<p>The very opener and intelligencer 1270</p>
<p>Between the grace, the sanctities 1271 of heaven</p>
<p>And our dull workings 1272 . O, who shall believe</p>
<p>But you 1273 misuse the reverence of your place 1274 ,</p>
<p>Employ the countenance 1275 and grace of heaven,</p>
<p>As a false 1276 favourite doth his prince’s name,</p>
<p>In deeds dishonourable? You have taken up 1277 ,</p>
<p>Under the counterfeited zeal 1278 of heaven,</p>
<p>The subjects of heaven’s substitute 1279 , my father,</p>
<p>And both against the peace of heaven and him</p>
<p>Have here upswarmèd 1280 them.</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Good my lord of Lancaster,</p>
<p>I am not here against your father’s peace,</p>
<p>But, as I told my lord of Westmorland,</p>
<p>The time misordered 1281 doth, in common sense 1282 ,</p>
<p>Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous 1283 form,</p>
<p>To hold our safety up 1284 . I sent your grace</p>
<p>The parcels 1285 and particulars of our grief,</p>
<p>The which hath been with scorn shoved 1286 from the court,</p>
<p>Whereon this Hydra 1287 son of war is born,</p>
<p>Whose dangerous eyes 1288 may well be charmed asleep</p>
<p>With grant of our most just and right desires,</p>
<p>And true obedience, of this madness cured,</p>
<p>Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY If not, we ready are to try our fortunes</p>
<p>To the last man.</p>
<p>HASTINGS And though we here fall down,</p>
<p>We have supplies 1289 to second 1290 our attempt:</p>
<p>If they miscarry, theirs shall second them,</p>
<p>And so success 1291 of mischief shall be born</p>
<p>And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up</p>
<p>Whiles England shall have generation 1292 .</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,</p>
<p>To sound the bottom 1293 of the after-times.</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly</p>
<p>How far forth 1294 you do like 1295 their articles.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN I like them all, and do allow them well 1296 ,</p>
<p>And swear here, by the honour of my blood,</p>
<p>My father’s purposes have been mistook 1297 ,</p>
<p>And some about him have too lavishly 1298</p>
<p>Wrested his meaning and authority.—</p>
<p>My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redressed,</p>
<p>To Archbishop</p>
<p>Upon my life, they shall. If this may please you,</p>
<p>Discharge your powers 1299 unto their several 1300 counties,</p>
<p>As we will ours, and here between the armies,</p>
<p>Let’s drink together friendly and embrace,</p>
<p>That all their eyes may bear those tokens 1301 home</p>
<p>Of our restorèd love and amity.</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK I take your princely word for these redresses.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN I give it you, and will maintain my word,</p>
<p>And thereupon I drink unto your grace.</p>
<p>Toasts Archbishop</p>
<p>HASTINGS Go, captain, and deliver to the army</p>
<p>This news of peace: let them have pay, and part 1302 .</p>
<p>I know it will well please them. Hie 1303 thee, captain.</p>
<p>Exit [Officer ]</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK To you, my noble lord of Westmorland.</p>
<p>Toasts Westmorland</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND I pledge 1304 your grace, and if you knew what pains</p>
<p>Toasts Archbishop</p>
<p>I have bestowed to breed this present peace,</p>
<p>You would drink freely. But my love to ye</p>
<p>Shall show itself more openly hereafter.</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK I do not doubt you.</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND I am glad of it.—</p>
<p>Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.</p>
<p>Toasts Mowbray</p>
<p>MOWBRAY You wish me health in very happy season 1305 ,</p>
<p>For I am, on the sudden, something 1306 ill.</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Against 1307 ill chances men are ever merry,</p>
<p>But heaviness foreruns the good event 1308 .</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Therefore be merry, coz 1309 , since sudden sorrow</p>
<p>Serves to say thus: ‘Some good thing comes tomorrow.’</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Believe me, I am passing 1310 light in spirit.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY So much the worse, if your own rule be true.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN The word of peace is rendered 1311 . Hark, how they
shout!</p>
<p>MOWBRAY This had been cheerful 1312 after victory.</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK A peace is of the nature of a conquest,</p>
<p>For then both parties nobly are subdued,</p>
<p>And neither party loser.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN Go, my lord,</p>
<p>To Westmorland</p>
<p>And let our army be dischargèd too.—</p>
<p>Exit [Westmorland ]</p>
<p>And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains 1313</p>
<p>To Archbishop</p>
<p>March by us, that we may peruse 1314 the men</p>
<p>We should have coped withal 1315 .</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Go, good Lord Hastings,</p>
<p>And ere they be dismissed, let them march by.</p>
<p>Exit [Hastings ]</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN I trust, lords, we shall lie 1316 tonight together.</p>
<p>Enter Westmorland</p>
<p>Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND The leaders, having charge from you to stand,</p>
<p>Will not go off until they hear you speak.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN They know their duties.</p>
<p>Enter Hastings</p>
<p>HASTINGS Our army is dispersed.</p>
<p>Like youthful steers unyoked 1317 , they took their course</p>
<p>East, west, north, south, or, like a school broke up,</p>
<p>Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place 1318 .</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Good tidings, my lord Hastings, for the which</p>
<p>I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason.—</p>
<p>And you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,</p>
<p>Of 1319 capital treason I attach 1320 you both.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY Is this proceeding just and honourable?</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Is your assembly so?</p>
<p>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK Will you thus break your faith?</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN I pawned 1321 thee none:</p>
<p>I promised you redress of these same grievances</p>
<p>Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,</p>
<p>I will perform with a most Christian care.</p>
<p>But for you, rebels, look to taste the due</p>
<p>Meet 1322 for rebellion and such acts as yours.</p>
<p>Most shallowly 1323 did you these arms commence,</p>
<p>Fondly 1324 brought here and foolishly sent hence.</p>
<p>Strike up our drums, pursue the scattered stray 1325 .</p>
<p>Heaven, and not we, have safely fought today.</p>
<p>Some guard these traitors to the block of death,</p>
<p>Treason’s true bed and yielder up of breath.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Enter Falstaff and Coleville [separately ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What’s your name, sir? Of what condition 1326 are you, and
of what place, I pray?</p>
<p>COLEVILLE I am a knight, sir, and my name is Coleville of the Dale
1327 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well, then, Coleville is your name, a knight is your degree,
and your place, the Dale. Coleville shall still be your name, a traitor
your degree, and the dungeon your place, a place deep enough so shall
you be still Coleville of the Dale.</p>
<p>COLEVILLE Are not you Sir John Falstaff?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF As good a man as he, sir, whoe’er I am. Do ye yield, sir, or
shall I sweat for you? If I do sweat, they are the drops 1328 of thy
lovers 1329 , and they weep for thy death: therefore rouse up fear and
trembling, and do observance 1330 to my mercy.</p>
<p>COLEVILLE I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that thought
yield me.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I have a whole school 1331 of tongues in this belly of mine,
and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name 1332 . An
1333 I had but a belly of any indifferency 1334 , I were simply the most
active fellow in Europe. My womb 1335 , my womb, my womb, undoes me.
Here comes our general.</p>
<p>Enter Prince John and Westmorland [with Blunt and others ]</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN The heat is past. Follow no further now.</p>
<p>Call in the powers, good cousin Westmorland.</p>
<p>[Exit Westmorland ]</p>
<p>Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?</p>
<p>When everything is ended, then you come.</p>
<p>These tardy tricks 1336 of yours will, on my life,</p>
<p>One time or other break some gallows’ back 1337 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be 1338 thus: I
never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valour. Do you
think me a swallow, an arrow, or a bullet? Have I, in my poor and old
motion, the expedition 1339 of thought? I have speeded hither with the
very extremest inch of possibility 1340 . I have foundered 1341 nine
score and odd posts 1342 , and here, travel-tainted as I am, have in my
pure and immaculate valour, taken Sir John Coleville of the Dale, a most
furious 1343 knight and valorous enemy. But what of that? He saw me, and
yielded, that I may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome 1344
, ‘I came, saw, and overcame.’</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I know not. Here he is, and here I yield him. And I beseech
your grace, let it be booked 1345 with the rest of this day’s deeds; or,
I swear, I will have it in a particular ballad 1346 , with mine own
picture 1347 on the top of it, Coleville kissing my foot: to the which
course, if I be enforced, if you do not all show like gilt two-pences
1348 to 1349 me, and I in the clear sky of fame o’ershine you as much as
the full moon doth the cinders of the element 1350 — which show like
pins’ heads to her — believe not the word of the noble: therefore let me
have right, and let desert mount 1351 .</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN Thine’s too heavy 1352 to mount.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Let it shine, then.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN Thine’s too thick 1353 to shine.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me good, and
call it what you will.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN Is thy name Coleville?</p>
<p>COLEVILLE It is, my lord.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN A famous rebel art thou, Coleville.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF And a famous true subject took him.</p>
<p>COLEVILLE I am, my lord, but as my betters are</p>
<p>That led me hither. Had they been ruled by me 1354 ,</p>
<p>You should have won them dearer 1355 than you have.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I know not how they sold 1356 themselves, but thou, like a
kind fellow, gav’st thyself away; and I thank thee for thee.</p>
<p>Enter Westmorland</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN Have you left 1357 pursuit?</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Retreat is made and execution stayed 1358 .</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN Send Coleville with his confederates</p>
<p>To York, to present 1359 execution.—</p>
<p>Blunt, lead him hence, and see you guard him sure 1360 .</p>
<p>Exeunt [Blunt and others ] with Coleville</p>
<p>And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords.</p>
<p>I hear the king my father is sore 1361 sick.</p>
<p>Our news shall go before us to his majesty,</p>
<p>Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,</p>
<p>To Westmorland</p>
<p>And we with sober 1362 speed will follow you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My lord, I beseech you give me leave to go through
Gloucestershire, and, when you come to court, stand my good lord, pray,
in your good report.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN Fare you well, Falstaff. I, in my condition 1363</p>
<p>Shall better speak of you than you deserve.</p>
<p>Exeunt [all but Falstaff ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I would 1364 you had but the wit: ’twere better than your
dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me,
nor a man cannot make him laugh. But that’s no marvel: he drinks no
wine. There’s never any of these demure boys come to any proof 1365 ,
for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood, and making many fish-meals
1366 , that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness 1367 , and then
when they marry, they get wenches 1368 . They are generally fools and
cowards; which some of us should be too, but for inflammation 1369 . A
good sherry-sack 1370 hath a two-fold operation in it: it ascends me
1371 into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy
1372 vapours 1373 which environ 1374 it, makes it apprehensive 1375 ,
quick, forgetive 1376 , full of nimble, fiery and delectable shapes,
which, deliver 1377 ed o’er to the voice, the tongue, which is the
birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of your excellent
sherry is the warming of the blood, which, before cold and settled, left
the liver white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity 1378 and
cowardice. But the sherry warms it and makes it course from the inwards
to the parts extremes 1379 : it illuminateth the face, which as a beacon
gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm. And
then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits 1380 muster me 1381
all to their captain, the heart, who, great and puffed up with his
retinue, doth any deed of courage, and this valour comes of sherry. So
that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets it
a-work 1382 , and learning a 1383 mere hoard of gold kept by a devil,
till sack commences 1384 it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it
that Prince Harry is valiant, for the cold blood he did naturally
inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,
manured, husbanded 1385 and tilled with excellent endeavour of drinking
good and good store of fertile sherry, that he is become very hot and
valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the first principle I would teach
them should be to forswear thin potations 1386 and to addict themselves
to sack.</p>
<p>Enter Bardolph</p>
<p>How now Bardolph?</p>
<p>BARDOLPH The army is dischargèd all and gone.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Let them go. I’ll through Gloucestershire, and there will I
visit Master Robert Shallow, Esquire. I have him already tempering 1387
between my finger and my thumb, and shortly will I seal with him 1388 .
Come away.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
