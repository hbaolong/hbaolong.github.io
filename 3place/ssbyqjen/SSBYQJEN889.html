<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-2">Scene 2 ／ running scene 2</h4>
<p>Cornets 218 . Enter King Henry [VIII ], leaning on the Cardinal
[Wolsey ]’s shoulder, the Nobles, [Wolsey’s Secretary ] and Sir Thomas
Lovell: the Cardinal places himself under the King’s feet 219 on his
right side</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII My life itself, and the best heart 220 of it,</p>
<p>Thanks you for this great care: I stood i’th’level 221</p>
<p>Of a full-charged 222 confederacy 223 , and give thanks</p>
<p>To you that choked it. Let be called before us</p>
<p>That gentleman of Buckingham’s: in person</p>
<p>I’ll hear him his confessions justify 224 ,</p>
<p>And point by point the treasons of his master</p>
<p>He shall again relate.</p>
<p>A noise within crying ‘Room for the Queen, ushered by the Duke of
Norfolk’. Enter the Queen [Katherine ], Norfolk and Suffolk: she kneels.
[The ] King riseth from his state 225 , takes her up, kisses and placeth
her by him</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Nay, we 226 must longer kneel: I am a suitor 227
.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Arise, and take place 228 by us: half your suit</p>
<p>The Queen moves to his side</p>
<p>Never name to us: you have half our power:</p>
<p>The other moiety 229 ere you ask is given:</p>
<p>Repeat your will 230 and take it.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE Thank 231 your majesty.</p>
<p>That you would love yourself, and in that love</p>
<p>Not unconsidered leave your honour, nor</p>
<p>The dignity 232 of your office, is the point</p>
<p>Of my petition.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Lady mine, proceed.</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE I am solicited 233 , not by a few,</p>
<p>And those of true 234 condition, that your subjects</p>
<p>Are in great grievance 235 : there have been commissions 236</p>
<p>Sent down among ’em which hath flawed 237 the heart</p>
<p>Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,</p>
<p>My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches</p>
<p>Most bitterly on you, as putter-on 238</p>
<p>Of these exactions 239 , yet the king our master —</p>
<p>Whose honour heaven shield from soil 240 — even he escapes not</p>
<p>Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks</p>
<p>The sides of loyalty, and almost appears</p>
<p>In loud rebellion.</p>
<p>NORFOLK Not ‘almost appears’,</p>
<p>It doth appear: for, upon these taxations,</p>
<p>The clothiers 241 all, not able to maintain</p>
<p>The many to them longing 242 , have put off 243</p>
<p>The spinsters 244 , carders 245 , fullers 246 , weavers, who,</p>
<p>Unfit for other life 247 , compelled by hunger</p>
<p>And lack of other means, in desperate manner</p>
<p>Daring th’event to th’teeth 248 , are all in uproar,</p>
<p>And danger 249 serves 250 among them.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Taxation?</p>
<p>Wherein, and what taxation? My lord cardinal,</p>
<p>You that are blamed for it alike with us,</p>
<p>Know you of this taxation?</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Please you, sir,</p>
<p>I know but of a single part 251 in aught 252</p>
<p>Pertains to th’state, and front but in that file</p>
<p>Where others tell steps with me 253 .</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE No, my lord?</p>
<p>You know no more than others? But you frame</p>
<p>Things that are known alike, which are not wholesome</p>
<p>To those which would not know them, and yet must</p>
<p>Perforce be their acquaintance 254 . These exactions,</p>
<p>Whereof my sovereign would have note 255 , they are</p>
<p>Most pestilent to th’hearing, and to bear 256 ’em</p>
<p>The back is sacrifice to th’load 257 . They say</p>
<p>They are devised by you, or else you suffer</p>
<p>Too hard an exclamation 258 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Still ‘exaction’:</p>
<p>The nature of it? In what kind 259 , let’s know,</p>
<p>Is this exaction?</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE I am much too venturous 260</p>
<p>In tempting of 261 your patience, but am boldened</p>
<p>Under 262 your promised pardon. The subjects’ grief 263</p>
<p>Comes through commissions, which compels from each</p>
<p>The sixth part of his substance 264 , to be levied</p>
<p>Without delay, and the pretence 265 for this</p>
<p>Is named your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:</p>
<p>Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze</p>
<p>Allegiance in them: their curses now</p>
<p>Live where their prayers 266 did: and it’s come to pass</p>
<p>This tractable 267 obedience is a slave</p>
<p>To each incensèd will 268 . I would 269 your highness</p>
<p>Would give it quick consideration, for</p>
<p>There is no primer baseness 270 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII By my life,</p>
<p>This is against our pleasure 271 .</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY And for me,</p>
<p>I have no further gone in this than by</p>
<p>A single voice 272 , and that not passed 273 me but</p>
<p>By learnèd approbation 274 of the judges: if I am</p>
<p>Traduced 275 by ignorant tongues, which neither know</p>
<p>My faculties 276 nor person, yet will be</p>
<p>The chronicles of my doing, let me say</p>
<p>’Tis but the fate of place 277 , and the rough brake 278</p>
<p>That virtue must go through: we must not stint 279</p>
<p>Our necessary actions, in the fear</p>
<p>To cope 280 malicious censurers 281 , which ever,</p>
<p>As rav’nous fishes, do a vessel follow</p>
<p>That is new trimmed 282 , but benefit no further</p>
<p>Than vainly longing 283 . What we oft do best,</p>
<p>By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is</p>
<p>Not ours, or not allowed 284 : what worst, as oft,</p>
<p>Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up</p>
<p>For our best act 285 : if we shall stand still,</p>
<p>In 286 fear our motion 287 will be mocked or carped at 288 ,</p>
<p>We should take root here where we sit,</p>
<p>Or sit state-statues 289 only.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Things done well,</p>
<p>And with a care, exempt themselves from fear:</p>
<p>Things done without example 290 , in their issue 291</p>
<p>Are to be feared. Have you a precedent</p>
<p>Of 292 this commission? I believe not any.</p>
<p>We must not rend our subjects from our laws,</p>
<p>And stick them in our will 293 . Sixth part of each?</p>
<p>A trembling 294 contribution; why, we take</p>
<p>From every tree lop 295 , bark, and part o’th’timber:</p>
<p>And though we leave it with a root, thus hacked</p>
<p>The air will drink the sap 296 . To every county</p>
<p>Where this is questioned 297 send our letters, with</p>
<p>Free pardon to each man that has denied</p>
<p>The force of this commission: pray, look to’t;</p>
<p>I put it to your care.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY A word with you.</p>
<p>To the Secretary</p>
<p>Let there be letters writ to every shire,</p>
<p>Of the king’s grace 298 and pardon.— The grievèd commons 299</p>
<p>Aside to Secretary</p>
<p>Hardly conceive 300 of me. Let it be noised 301</p>
<p>That through our 302 intercession this revokement 303</p>
<p>And pardon comes: I shall anon 304 advise you</p>
<p>Further in the proceeding.</p>
<p>Exit Secretary</p>
<p>Enter Surveyor</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham</p>
<p>To the King</p>
<p>Is run in 305 your displeasure.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII It grieves many:</p>
<p>The gentleman is learnèd, and a most rare 306 speaker,</p>
<p>To nature none more bound 307 : his training such</p>
<p>That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,</p>
<p>And never seek for aid out of 308 himself: yet see,</p>
<p>When these so noble benefits shall prove</p>
<p>Not well disposed 309 , the mind growing once corrupt,</p>
<p>They turn to vicious 310 forms, ten times more ugly</p>
<p>Than ever they were fair. This man so complete 311 ,</p>
<p>Who was enrolled ’mongst wonders — and when we,</p>
<p>Almost with ravished 312 listening, could not find</p>
<p>His hour of speech a minute — he, my lady,</p>
<p>Hath into monstrous 313 habits 314 put the graces</p>
<p>That once were his, and is become as black</p>
<p>As if besmeared in hell. Sit by us: you shall hear —</p>
<p>This was his gentleman in trust 315 — of him</p>
<p>Things to strike honour sad.— Bid him recount</p>
<p>To Wolsey</p>
<p>The fore-recited practices 316 , whereof</p>
<p>We cannot feel too little, hear too much 317 .</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you</p>
<p>To the Surveyor</p>
<p>Most like a careful 318 subject have collected 319</p>
<p>Out of the Duke of Buckingham.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Speak freely.</p>
<p>SURVEYOR First, it was usual with him — every day</p>
<p>It would infect his speech — that if the king</p>
<p>Should without issue 320 die, he’ll carry 321 it so</p>
<p>To make the sceptre 322 his. These very words</p>
<p>I’ve heard him utter to his son-in-law,</p>
<p>Lord Aberga’nny, to whom by oath he menaced 323</p>
<p>Revenge upon the cardinal.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Please your highness note</p>
<p>His dangerous conception 324 in this point,</p>
<p>Not friended by his wish to your high person 325 :</p>
<p>His will is most malignant, and it stretches</p>
<p>Beyond you to your friends 326 .</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE My learnèd lord cardinal,</p>
<p>Deliver 327 all with charity.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Speak on:</p>
<p>To the Surveyor</p>
<p>How grounded he his title to the crown</p>
<p>Upon our fail? 328 To this point 329 hast thou heard him</p>
<p>At any time speak aught?</p>
<p>SURVEYOR He was brought to this</p>
<p>By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII What was that Hopkins?</p>
<p>SURVEYOR Sir, a Chartreux 330 friar,</p>
<p>His confessor, who fed him every minute</p>
<p>With words of sovereignty.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII How know’st thou this?</p>
<p>SURVEYOR Not long before your highness sped to France,</p>
<p>The Duke being at the Rose 331 , within the parish</p>
<p>St Lawrence Poultney 332 , did of me demand</p>
<p>What was the speech 333 among the Londoners</p>
<p>Concerning the French journey. I replied</p>
<p>Men feared the French would prove perfidious 334</p>
<p>To the king’s danger 335 : presently 336 the duke</p>
<p>Said ’twas the fear indeed and that he doubted 337</p>
<p>’Twould prove the verity of certain words</p>
<p>Spoke by a holy monk that oft, says he,</p>
<p>’Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit</p>
<p>John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice 338 hour</p>
<p>To hear from him a matter of some moment 339 :</p>
<p>Whom after under the confession’s seal</p>
<p>He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke</p>
<p>My chaplain to no creature living but</p>
<p>To me should utter, with demure confidence 340</p>
<p>This pausingly ensued: ’’Neither the king nor’s heirs,</p>
<p>Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive</p>
<p>To gain the love o’th’commonalty 341 : the duke</p>
<p>Shall govern England.’’’</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE If I know you well,</p>
<p>You were the duke’s surveyor, and lost your office</p>
<p>On the complaint o’th’tenants: take good heed</p>
<p>You charge not in your spleen 342 a noble person</p>
<p>And spoil your nobler 343 soul: I say, take heed:</p>
<p>Yes, heartily beseech you.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Let him on 344 :</p>
<p>Go forward.</p>
<p>To the Surveyor</p>
<p>SURVEYOR On my soul, I’ll speak but 345 truth.</p>
<p>I told my lord the duke, by th’devil’s illusions</p>
<p>The monk might be deceived, and that ’twas dangerous</p>
<p>For him to ruminate on this so far, until</p>
<p>It forged 346 him some design, which being believed,</p>
<p>It was much like to do 347 : he answered, ’Tush,</p>
<p>It can do me no damage’, adding further,</p>
<p>That had the king in his last sickness failed 348 ,</p>
<p>The cardinal’s and Sir Thomas Lovell’s heads</p>
<p>Should have gone off.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Ha? What, so rank 349 ? Ah, ha!</p>
<p>There’s mischief in this man: canst thou say further?</p>
<p>SURVEYOR I can, my liege.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Proceed.</p>
<p>SURVEYOR Being at Greenwich 350 ,</p>
<p>After your highness had reproved the duke</p>
<p>About Sir William Bulmer—</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII I remember</p>
<p>Of such a time: being my sworn servant,</p>
<p>The duke retained him his 351 . But on: what hence?</p>
<p>SURVEYOR ‘If’, quoth he, ‘I for this had been committed 352’ —</p>
<p>As to the Tower, I thought, — ’I would have played</p>
<p>The part my father meant to act upon</p>
<p>Th’usurper Richard 353 , who, being at Salisbury 354 ,</p>
<p>Made suit 355 to come in’s presence: which if granted,</p>
<p>As he made semblance of his duty 356 , would</p>
<p>Have put his knife to him.’</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII A giant traitor.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Now, madam, may his highness live in freedom,</p>
<p>And this man out of prison?</p>
<p>QUEEN KATHERINE God mend all 357 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII There’s something more would out of thee: what
say’st?</p>
<p>SURVEYOR After ‘the duke his father’, with ‘the knife’,</p>
<p>He stretched him 358 , and with one hand on his dagger,</p>
<p>Another spread on’s breast, mounting 359 his eyes,</p>
<p>He did discharge a horrible oath, whose tenor</p>
<p>Was, were he evil used 360 , he would outgo 361</p>
<p>His father by as much as a performance</p>
<p>Does an irresolute 362 purpose.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII There’s his period 363 :</p>
<p>To sheathe his knife in us: he is attached 364 :</p>
<p>Call him to present 365 trial: if he may</p>
<p>Find mercy in the law, ’tis his: if none,</p>
<p>Let him not seek’t of us: by day and night,</p>
<p>He’s traitor to th’height 366 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
