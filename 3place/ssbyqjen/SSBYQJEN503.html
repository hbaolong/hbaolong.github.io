<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-7">Scene 1 / running scene 7</h4>
<p>Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and
Lords</p>
<p>KING And can you by no drift of circumstance 866</p>
<p>Get from him why he puts on this confusion,</p>
<p>Grating 867 so harshly all his days of quiet</p>
<p>With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ He does confess he feels himself distracted,</p>
<p>But from what cause he will by no means speak.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN Nor do we find him forward 868 to be sounded 869 ,</p>
<p>But with a crafty madness keeps aloof</p>
<p>When we would bring him on to some confession</p>
<p>Of his true state.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Did he receive you well?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Most like a gentleman.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN But with much forcing of his disposition 870 .</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Niggard of question 871 , but of our demands 872</p>
<p>Most free in his reply.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Did you assay 873 him to any pastime?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Madam, it so fell out that certain players</p>
<p>We o’erraught 874 on the way: of these we told him,</p>
<p>And there did seem in him a kind of joy</p>
<p>To hear of it: they are about the court,</p>
<p>And, as I think, they have already order</p>
<p>This night to play before him.</p>
<p>POLONIUS ’Tis most true:</p>
<p>And he beseeched me to entreat your majesties</p>
<p>To hear and see the matter.</p>
<p>KING With all my heart, and it doth much content me</p>
<p>To hear him so inclined.</p>
<p>Good gentlemen, give him a further edge 875</p>
<p>And drive his purpose on to these delights.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ We shall, my lord.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]</p>
<p>KING Sweet Gertrude, leave us too.</p>
<p>↓Exit Lords↓</p>
<p>For we have closely 876 sent for Hamlet hither,</p>
<p>That he, as ’twere by accident, may here</p>
<p>Affront 877 Ophelia:</p>
<p>Her father and myself, lawful espials 878 ,</p>
<p>Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,</p>
<p>We may of their encounter frankly judge,</p>
<p>And gather by him, as he is behaved,</p>
<p>If’t be th’affliction of his love or no</p>
<p>That thus he suffers for.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE I shall obey you.—</p>
<p>And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish</p>
<p>That your good beauties be the happy cause</p>
<p>Of Hamlet’s wildness: so shall I hope your virtues</p>
<p>Will bring him to his wonted way again,</p>
<p>To both your honours.</p>
<p>OPHELIA Madam, I wish it may.</p>
<p>[Exit Gertrude]</p>
<p>POLONIUS Ophelia, walk you here.— Gracious 879 , so please you,</p>
<p>We will bestow ourselves.— Read on this book,</p>
<p>To Ophelia</p>
<p>That show of such an exercise 880 may colour</p>
<p>Gives a book</p>
<p>Your loneliness 881 . We are oft to blame in this —</p>
<p>’Tis too much proved — that with devotion’s visage 882</p>
<p>And pious action we do sugar o’er</p>
<p>The devil himself.</p>
<p>KING O, ’tis true!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!</p>
<p>The harlot’s cheek, beautied with plast’ring art 883 ,</p>
<p>Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it 884</p>
<p>Than is my deed to my most painted word.</p>
<p>O, heavy burden!</p>
<p>POLONIUS I hear him coming: let’s withdraw, my lord.</p>
<p>Exeunt [King and Polonius]</p>
<p>To a place from where they eavesdrop, while Ophelia pretends to
read</p>
<p>Enter Hamlet</p>
<p>HAMLET To be, or not to be, that is the question:</p>
<p>Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer</p>
<p>The slings 885 and arrows of outrageous 886 fortune,</p>
<p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</p>
<p>And by opposing end them? To die, to sleep —</p>
<p>No more — and by a sleep to say we end</p>
<p>The heartache and the thousand natural shocks 887</p>
<p>That flesh is heir to: ’tis a consummation 888</p>
<p>Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep:</p>
<p>To sleep, perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub 889 ,</p>
<p>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come</p>
<p>When we have shuffled off 890 this mortal coil 891 ,</p>
<p>Must give us pause: there’s the respect 892</p>
<p>That makes calamity of so long life 893 ,</p>
<p>For who would bear the whips and scorns 894 of time,</p>
<p>The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely 895 ,</p>
<p>The pangs of disprized 896 love, the law’s delay,</p>
<p>The insolence of office 897 and the spurns 898</p>
<p>That patient merit of the unworthy takes 899 ,</p>
<p>When he himself might his quietus 900 make</p>
<p>With a bare 901 bodkin 902 ? Who would these fardels 903 bear,</p>
<p>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</p>
<p>But that the dread of something after death,</p>
<p>The undiscovered country from whose bourn 904</p>
<p>No traveller returns, puzzles 905 the will,</p>
<p>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</p>
<p>Than fly to others that we know not of?</p>
<p>Thus conscience 906 does make cowards of us all:</p>
<p>And thus the native hue 907 of resolution</p>
<p>Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast 908 of thought,</p>
<p>And enterprises of great pith and moment 909</p>
<p>With this regard their currents turn away,</p>
<p>And lose the name of action. Soft you 910 now,</p>
<p>The fair Ophelia.— Nymph, in thy orisons 911</p>
<p>Be all my sins remembered.</p>
<p>OPHELIA Good my lord,</p>
<p>How does your honour for this many a day?</p>
<p>HAMLET I humbly thank you: well, well, well.</p>
<p>OPHELIA My lord, I have remembrances 912 of yours,</p>
<p>That I have longèd long to re-deliver:</p>
<p>I pray you now receive them.</p>
<p>Offers love tokens</p>
<p>HAMLET No, no: I never gave you aught.</p>
<p>OPHELIA My honoured lord, I know right well you did,</p>
<p>And with them words of so sweet breath composed</p>
<p>As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,</p>
<p>Take these again, for to the noble mind</p>
<p>Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.</p>
<p>There, my lord.</p>
<p>Tries to hand over tokens</p>
<p>HAMLET Ha, ha! Are you honest 913 ?</p>
<p>OPHELIA My lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET Are you fair 914 ?</p>
<p>OPHELIA What means your lordship?</p>
<p>HAMLET That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
discourse to your beauty 915 .</p>
<p>OPHELIA Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce 916 than with
honesty?</p>
<p>HAMLET Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner transform
honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
translate beauty into his 917 likeness: this was sometime 918 a paradox
919 , but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.</p>
<p>OPHELIA Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</p>
<p>HAMLET You should not have believed me, for virtue cannot so
inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it 920 : I loved you
not.</p>
<p>OPHELIA I was the more deceived.</p>
<p>HAMLET Get thee to a nunnery 921 . Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
sinners? I am myself indifferent honest 922 , but yet I could accuse me
of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck 923 than I
have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to
act them in. What should such fellows as I do</p>
<p>crawling between heaven and earth? We are arrant knaves all: believe
none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where’s your father?</p>
<p>OPHELIA At home, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
nowhere but in’s own house. Farewell.</p>
<p>OPHELIA O, help him, you sweet heavens!</p>
<p>HAMLET If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny
924 . Get thee to a nunnery: go, farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry,
marry a fool, for wise men know well enough what monsters 925 you make
of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell.</p>
<p>OPHELIA O heavenly powers, restore him!</p>
<p>HAMLET I have heard of your paintings 926 too, well enough. God has
given you one face and you make yourself another: you jig, you amble 927
and you lisp 928 , and nickname God’s creatures, and make your
wantonness your ignorance 929 . Go to, I’ll no more on’t 930 : it hath
made me mad. I say we will have no more marriages: those that are
married already, all but one shall live: the rest shall keep as they
are. To a nunnery, go.</p>
<p>Exit Hamlet</p>
<p>OPHELIA O, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!</p>
<p>The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s, eye, tongue, sword,</p>
<p>Th’expectancy 931 and rose of the fair state,</p>
<p>The glass of fashion 932 and the mould of form 933 ,</p>
<p>Th’observed of all observers, quite, quite down!</p>
<p>And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,</p>
<p>That sucked the honey of his music vows,</p>
<p>Now see that noble and most sovereign reason</p>
<p>Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh,</p>
<p>That unmatched form and feature of blown 934 youth</p>
<p>Blasted with ecstasy 935 . O, woe is me,</p>
<p>T’have seen what I have seen, see what I see!</p>
<p>Enter King and Polonius</p>
<p>From their hiding place</p>
<p>KING Love? His affections 936 do not that way tend,</p>
<p>Nor what he spake, though it lacked form a little,</p>
<p>Was not like madness. There’s something in his soul</p>
<p>O’er which his melancholy sits on brood 937 ,</p>
<p>And I do doubt 938 the hatch and the disclose 939</p>
<p>Will be some danger, which to prevent,</p>
<p>I have in quick determination</p>
<p>Thus set it down 940 : he shall with speed to England</p>
<p>For the demand of our neglected tribute 941 .</p>
<p>Haply 942 the seas and countries different</p>
<p>With variable objects 943 shall expel</p>
<p>This something-settled matter 944 in his heart,</p>
<p>Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus</p>
<p>From fashion of himself 945 . What think you on’t?</p>
<p>POLONIUS It shall do well. But yet do I believe</p>
<p>The origin and commencement of this grief</p>
<p>Sprung from neglected love.— How now, Ophelia?</p>
<p>You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said:</p>
<p>We heard it all. My lord, do as you please,</p>
<p>But, if you hold it fit, after the play</p>
<p>Let his queen mother all alone entreat him</p>
<p>To show his griefs: let her be round 946 with him,</p>
<p>And I’ll be placed, so please you, in the ear</p>
<p>Of all their conference. If she find him not 947 ,</p>
<p>To England send him, or confine him where</p>
<p>Your wisdom best shall think.</p>
<p>KING It shall be so:</p>
<p>Madness in great ones must not unwatched go.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
