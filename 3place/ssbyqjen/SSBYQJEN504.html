<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-8">Scene 2 / running scene 8</h4>
<p>Enter Hamlet and two or three of the Players</p>
<p>HAMLET Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
trippingly 948 on the tongue: but if you mouth 949 it, as many of your
players do, I had as lief 950 the town- crier had spoke my lines. Nor do
not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for
in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, the whirlwind of
passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it
smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to see a robustious 951
periwig-pated 952 fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to
split the ears of the groundlings 953 , who for the most part are
capable of 954 nothing but inexplicable dumb shows 955 and noise: I
could have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant 956 : it
out-Herods Herod 957 . Pray you avoid it.</p>
<p>A PLAYER I warrant 958 your honour.</p>
<p>HAMLET Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion 959 be
your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with
this special observance: that you o’erstep not the modesty 960 of
nature; for anything so overdone is from 961 the purpose of playing,
whose end, both at the first and now, was and is to hold as ’twere the
mirror up to nature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own
image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure 962 .
Now this overdone or come tardy off 963 , though it make the unskilful
964 laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure 965 of the
which one 966 must in your allowance 967 o’erweigh a whole theatre of
others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others
praise, and that highly — not to speak it profanely — that, neither
having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor no
man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature’s
journeymen 968 had made men and not made them well, they imitated
humanity so abominably 969 .</p>
<p>A PLAYER I hope we have reformed that indifferently 970 with us,
sir.</p>
<p>HAMLET O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns
speak no more than is set down for them, for there be of 971 them that
will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren 972 spectators
to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary question 973 of the
play be then to be considered: that’s villainous, and shows a most
pitiful ambition in the fool that uses 974 it. Go, make you ready.—</p>
<p>Exeunt Players</p>
<p>Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</p>
<p>How now, my lord, will the king hear this piece of work?</p>
<p>POLONIUS And the queen too, and that presently 975 .</p>
<p>HAMLET Bid the players make haste.—</p>
<p>Exit Polonius</p>
<p>Will you two help to hasten them?</p>
<p>BOTH We will, my lord.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]</p>
<p>Enter Horatio</p>
<p>HAMLET What ho, Horatio!</p>
<p>HORATIO Here, sweet lord, at your service.</p>
<p>HAMLET Horatio, thou art e’en as just a man</p>
<p>As e’er my conversation coped withal 976 .</p>
<p>HORATIO O, my dear lord—</p>
<p>HAMLET Nay, do not think I flatter,</p>
<p>For what advancement may I hope from thee</p>
<p>That no revenue hast but thy good spirits</p>
<p>To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flattered?</p>
<p>No, let the candied 977 tongue lick absurd pomp,</p>
<p>And crook 978 the pregnant 979 hinges of the knee</p>
<p>Where thrift 980 may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?</p>
<p>Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice</p>
<p>And could of men distinguish, her election 981</p>
<p>Hath sealed 982 thee for herself, for thou hast been</p>
<p>As one, in suffering 983 all, that suffers nothing 984 ,</p>
<p>A man that fortune’s buffets 985 and rewards</p>
<p>Hath ta’en with equal thanks: and blest are those</p>
<p>Whose blood 986 and judgement are so well commingled</p>
<p>That they are not a pipe for fortune’s finger</p>
<p>To sound what stop 987 she please. Give me that man</p>
<p>That is not passion’s slave, and I will wear him</p>
<p>In my heart’s core 988 , ay, in my heart of heart,</p>
<p>As I do thee. Something too much of this.</p>
<p>There is a play tonight before the king:</p>
<p>One scene of it comes near the circumstance</p>
<p>Which I have told thee of my father’s death:</p>
<p>I prithee, when thou see’st that act afoot,</p>
<p>Even with the very comment of thy soul 989</p>
<p>Observe mine uncle: if his occulted 990 guilt</p>
<p>Do not itself unkennel 991 in one speech,</p>
<p>It is a damnèd 992 ghost that we have seen,</p>
<p>And my imaginations are as foul 993</p>
<p>As Vulcan’s stithy 994 . Give him heedful note 995 ,</p>
<p>For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,</p>
<p>And after we will both our judgements join</p>
<p>In censure of his seeming 996 .</p>
<p>HORATIO Well, my lord.</p>
<p>If he steal aught 997 the whilst this play is playing</p>
<p>And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.</p>
<p>Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and
other Lords Attendant with his Guard carrying torches. Danish march 998
. Sound a flourish</p>
<p>HAMLET They are coming to the play: I must be idle 999 .</p>
<p>Get you a place.</p>
<p>KING How fares 1000 our cousin Hamlet?</p>
<p>HAMLET Excellent, i’faith, of the chameleon’s dish 1001 : I eat the
air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons 1002 so.</p>
<p>KING I have nothing with 1003 this answer, Hamlet: these words are
not mine 1004 .</p>
<p>HAMLET No, nor mine now.— My lord, you played once i’th’university,
you say?</p>
<p>To Polonius</p>
<p>POLONIUS That I did, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.</p>
<p>HAMLET And what did you enact?</p>
<p>POLONIUS I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i’th’Capitol 1005 :
Brutus killed me.</p>
<p>HAMLET It was a brute 1006 part 1007 of him to kill so capital a calf
1008 there.— Be the players ready?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Ay, my lord: they stay upon your patience 1009 .</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Come hither, my good Hamlet, sit by me.</p>
<p>HAMLET No, good mother, here’s metal more attractive 1010 .</p>
<p>POLONIUS O, ho! Do you mark that?</p>
<p>To King</p>
<p>HAMLET Lady, shall I lie in your lap 1011 ?</p>
<p>OPHELIA No, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET I mean, my head upon your lap?</p>
<p>OPHELIA Ay, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Do you think I meant country matters 1012 ?</p>
<p>OPHELIA I think nothing, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs.</p>
<p>OPHELIA What is, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET Nothing 1013 .</p>
<p>OPHELIA You are merry, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Who, I?</p>
<p>OPHELIA Ay, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET O, God, your only jig-maker 1014 . What should a man do but be
merry? For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
within’s two hours.</p>
<p>OPHELIA Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a
suit of sables 1015 . O heavens! Die two months ago, and not forgotten
yet? Then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a
year: but, by’r lady, he must build churches, then, or else shall he
suffer not thinking on 1016 , with the hobby-horse 1017 , whose epitaph
is ‘For, O, for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot.’</p>
<p>Hautboys 1018 play. The dumb show enters</p>
<p>Enter a King and Queen very lovingly, the Queen embracing him. She
kneels, and makes show of protestation 1019 unto him. He takes her up,
and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of
flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow,
takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King’s ears, and
exits. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate
action 1020 . The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes 1021 , comes in
again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The
Poisoner woos the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling
awhile, but in the end accepts his love.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>OPHELIA What means this, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET Marry, this is miching malicho 1022 : that means mischief.</p>
<p>OPHELIA Belike 1023 this show imports the argument 1024 of the
play.</p>
<p>HAMLET We shall know by these fellows: the players cannot keep
counsel 1025 , they’ll tell all.</p>
<p>OPHELIA Will they tell us what this show 1026 meant?</p>
<p>HAMLET Ay, or any show that you’ll show him: be not you 1027 ashamed
to show, he’ll not shame to tell you what it means.</p>
<p>OPHELIA You are naught 1028 , you are naught: I’ll mark the play.</p>
<p>Enter Prologue</p>
<p>PROLOGUE For us, and for our tragedy,</p>
<p>Here stooping to your clemency,</p>
<p>We beg your hearing patiently.</p>
<p>[Exit]</p>
<p>HAMLET Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring 1029 ?</p>
<p>OPHELIA ’Tis brief, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET As woman’s love.</p>
<p>Enter [two Players as]</p>
<p>King and his Queen [Baptista]</p>
<p>PLAYER KING Full thirty times hath Phoebus’ cart 1030 gone round</p>
<p>Neptune’s salt wash 1031 and Tellus’ orbèd ground 1032 ,</p>
<p>And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen 1033</p>
<p>About the world have times twelve thirties been,</p>
<p>Since love our hearts and Hymen 1034 did our hands</p>
<p>Unite commutual in most sacred bands 1035 .</p>
<p>BAPTISTA So many journeys may the sun and moon</p>
<p>Make us again count o’er ere love be done!</p>
<p>But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,</p>
<p>So far from cheer and from your former state,</p>
<p>That I distrust 1036 you: yet, though I distrust,</p>
<p>Discomfort 1037 you, my lord, it nothing must,</p>
<p>For women’s fear and love holds quantity 1038 ,</p>
<p>In neither aught, or in extremity 1039 .</p>
<p>Now, what my love is, proof 1040 hath made you know,</p>
<p>And as my love is sized, my fear is so 1041 .</p>
<p>PLAYER KING Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too:</p>
<p>My operant 1042 powers my functions leave to do 1043 .</p>
<p>And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,</p>
<p>Honoured, beloved: and haply one as kind</p>
<p>For husband shalt thou—</p>
<p>BAPTISTA O, confound 1044 the rest!</p>
<p>Such love must needs be treason in my breast:</p>
<p>In second husband let me be accurst!</p>
<p>None 1045 wed the second but who killed the first.</p>
<p>HAMLET Wormwood 1046 , wormwood.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>BAPTISTA The instances 1047 that second marriage move 1048</p>
<p>Are base respects of thrift 1049 , but none of love:</p>
<p>A second time I kill my husband dead,</p>
<p>When second husband kisses me in bed.</p>
<p>PLAYER KING I do believe you think what now you speak,</p>
<p>But what we do determine oft we break.</p>
<p>Purpose is but the slave to memory,</p>
<p>Of violent birth, but poor validity 1050 ,</p>
<p>Which 1051 now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,</p>
<p>But fall unshaken when they mellow be.</p>
<p>Most necessary ’tis that we forget</p>
<p>To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt 1052 :</p>
<p>What to ourselves in passion we propose,</p>
<p>The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.</p>
<p>The violence of either grief or joy</p>
<p>Their own enactures 1053 with themselves destroy:</p>
<p>Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;</p>
<p>Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident 1054 .</p>
<p>This world is not for aye 1055 , nor ’tis not strange</p>
<p>That even our loves should with our fortunes change,</p>
<p>For ’tis a question left us yet to prove,</p>
<p>Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.</p>
<p>The great man down 1056 , you mark his favourites flies:</p>
<p>The poor advanced 1057 makes friends of enemies.</p>
<p>And hitherto 1058 doth love on fortune tend 1059 ,</p>
<p>For who not needs 1060 shall never lack a friend,</p>
<p>And who in want 1061 a hollow friend doth try 1062 ,</p>
<p>Directly seasons him 1063 his enemy.</p>
<p>But, orderly to end where I begun,</p>
<p>Our wills and fates do so contrary run</p>
<p>That our devices 1064 still 1065 are overthrown:</p>
<p>Our thoughts are ours, their ends 1066 none of our own.</p>
<p>So think thou wilt no second husband wed,</p>
<p>But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Nor 1067 earth to me give food, nor heaven light,</p>
<p>Sport and repose lock from me day and night 1068 ,</p>
<p>Each opposite 1069 that blanks 1070 the face of joy</p>
<p>Meet what I would have well and it destroy 1071 !</p>
<p>Both here and hence 1072 pursue me lasting strife,</p>
<p>If, once a widow, ever I be wife!</p>
<p>HAMLET If she should break it now!</p>
<p>PLAYER KING ’Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile:</p>
<p>My spirits grow dull, and fain 1073 I would beguile 1074</p>
<p>The tedious day with sleep.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Sleep rock thy brain,</p>
<p>[He] sleeps</p>
<p>And never come mischance between us twain.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>HAMLET Madam, how like you this play?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE The lady protests 1075 too much, methinks.</p>
<p>HAMLET O, but she’ll keep her word.</p>
<p>KING Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence 1076 in’t?</p>
<p>HAMLET No, no, they do but jest 1077 , poison in jest: no offence
i’th’world.</p>
<p>KING What do you call the play?</p>
<p>HAMLET The Mousetrap . Marry, how? Tropically 1078 . This play is the
image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke’s 1079 name, his
wife, Baptista. You shall see anon: ’tis a knavish piece of work, but
what o’that? Your majesty and we that have free souls, it touches us
not: let the galled jade 1080 wince 1081 , our withers 1082 are unwrung
1083 .</p>
<p>Enter Lucianus</p>
<p>This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.</p>
<p>OPHELIA You are a good chorus 1084 , my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET I could interpret 1085 between you and your love, if I could
see the puppets 1086 dallying 1087 .</p>
<p>OPHELIA You are keen 1088 , my lord, you are keen.</p>
<p>HAMLET It would cost you a groaning 1089 to take off my edge 1090
.</p>
<p>OPHELIA Still better, and worse 1091 .</p>
<p>HAMLET So 1092 you mis-take your husbands 1093 .— Begin, murderer:
pox 1094 , leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come, the croaking raven
1095 doth bellow for revenge 1096 .</p>
<p>LUCIANUS Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit and time agreeing,</p>
<p>Confederate season, else no creature seeing 1097 ,</p>
<p>Thou mixture rank 1098 , of midnight weeds collected,</p>
<p>With Hecate’s ban 1099 thrice blasted, thrice infected,</p>
<p>Thy natural magic and dire property 1100 ,</p>
<p>On wholesome 1101 life usurp immediately.</p>
<p>Pours the poison in his ears</p>
<p>HAMLET He poisons him i’th’garden for’s 1102 estate. His 1103 name’s
Gonzago: the story is extant and writ in choice Italian. You shall see
anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife.</p>
<p>King stands</p>
<p>OPHELIA The king rises.</p>
<p>HAMLET What, frighted with false fire 1104 ?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE How fares my lord?</p>
<p>POLONIUS Give o’er the play.</p>
<p>KING Give me some light. Away!</p>
<p>ALL Lights, lights, lights!</p>
<p>Exeunt. Hamlet and Horatio remain</p>
<p>HAMLET Why, let the strucken 1105 deer go weep,</p>
<p>The hart ungallèd 1106 play,</p>
<p>For some must watch 1107 , while some must sleep:</p>
<p>So runs the world away.</p>
<p>Would not this 1108 , sir, and a forest of feathers 1109 — if the
rest of my fortunes turn Turk with 1110 me — with two Provincial roses
1111 on my razed shoes 1112 , get me a fellowship in a cry 1113 of
players, sir?</p>
<p>HORATIO Half a share 1114 .</p>
<p>HAMLET A whole one, I.</p>
<p>For thou dost know, O Damon 1115 dear,</p>
<p>This realm dismantled 1116 was</p>
<p>Of Jove 1117 himself, and now reigns here</p>
<p>A very, very — pajock 1118 .</p>
<p>HORATIO You might have rhymed 1119 .</p>
<p>HAMLET O, good Horatio, I’ll take the ghost’s word for a thousand
pound. Didst perceive?</p>
<p>HORATIO Very well, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Upon the talk of the poisoning?</p>
<p>HORATIO I did very well note him.</p>
<p>HAMLET O, ha! Come, some music. Come, the recorders.</p>
<p>For if the king like not the comedy,</p>
<p>Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy 1120 .</p>
<p>Come, some music!</p>
<p>Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN Good my lord, vouchsafe 1121 me a word with you.</p>
<p>HAMLET Sir, a whole history.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN The king, sir—</p>
<p>HAMLET Ay, sir, what of him?</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN Is in his retirement 1122 marvellous distempered 1123
.</p>
<p>HAMLET With drink, sir?</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN No, my lord, rather with choler 1124 .</p>
<p>HAMLET Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify 1125
this to his doctor, for for me to put him to his purgation 1126 would
perhaps plunge him into far more choler.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame 1127
and start 1128 not so wildly from my affair.</p>
<p>HAMLET I am tame, sir: pronounce.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit, hath sent me to you.</p>
<p>HAMLET You are welcome.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed 1129 . If it shall please you to make me a wholesome 1130 answer,
I will do your mother’s commandment: if not, your pardon 1131 and my
return shall be the end of my business.</p>
<p>HAMLET Sir, I cannot.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN What, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET Make you a wholesome answer: my wit’s diseased. But, sir, such
answers as I can make, you shall command, or rather, as you say, my
mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you say—</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
amazement 1132 and admiration 1133 .</p>
<p>HAMLET O, wonderful 1134 son, that can so astonish a mother! But is
there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ She desires to speak with you in her closet 1135 ere you
go to bed.</p>
<p>HAMLET We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
further trade 1136 with us?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ My lord, you once did love me.</p>
<p>HAMLET So I do still, by these pickers and stealers 1137 .</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
freely bar the door of your own liberty 1138 , if you deny 1139 your
griefs to your friend.</p>
<p>HAMLET Sir, I lack advancement.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
himself for your succession in Denmark?</p>
<p>HAMLET Ay, but ‘While the grass grows’ 1140 — the proverb is
something musty.</p>
<p>Enter one with a recorder</p>
<p>O, the recorder! Let me see.</p>
<p>Takes the recorder</p>
<p>To withdraw 1141 with you: why do you go about to recover the wind of
me, as if you would drive me into a toil 1142 ?</p>
<p>To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly 1143 .</p>
<p>HAMLET I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN My lord, I cannot.</p>
<p>HAMLET I pray you.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN Believe me, I cannot.</p>
<p>HAMLET I do beseech you.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN I know no touch of it, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET ’Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages 1144 with your
finger and thumb, give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse
most excellent music. Look you, these are the stops.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony:
I have not the skill.</p>
<p>HAMLET Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops, you would pluck out
the heart of my mystery 1145 , you would sound 1146 me from my lowest
note to the top of my compass 1147 , and there is much music, excellent
voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak. Why, do you
think that I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
instrument you will, though you can fret 1148 me, you cannot play upon
me.— God bless you, sir!</p>
<p>To the entering Polonius</p>
<p>Enter Polonius</p>
<p>POLONIUS My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently 1149
.</p>
<p>HAMLET Do you see that cloud that’s almost in shape like a camel?</p>
<p>POLONIUS By th’mass 1150 , and it’s like a camel indeed.</p>
<p>HAMLET Methinks it is like a weasel.</p>
<p>POLONIUS It is backed like a weasel.</p>
<p>HAMLET Or like a whale?</p>
<p>POLONIUS Very like a whale.</p>
<p>HAMLET Then will I will come to my mother by and by.— They fool me to
the top of my bent 1151 .— I will come by and by.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>POLONIUS I will say so.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>HAMLET ‘By and by’ is easily said.</p>
<p>Leave me, friends.</p>
<p>[Exeunt all but Hamlet]</p>
<p>’Tis now the very witching time of night,</p>
<p>When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out</p>
<p>Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood</p>
<p>And do such bitter business as the day</p>
<p>Would quake to look on. Soft, now to my mother.</p>
<p>O heart, lose not thy nature 1152 ; let not ever</p>
<p>The soul of Nero 1153 enter this firm bosom:</p>
<p>Let me be cruel, not unnatural.</p>
<p>I will speak daggers to her, but use none.</p>
<p>My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites:</p>
<p>How in my words somever 1154 she be shent 1155 ,</p>
<p>To give them seals 1156 never my soul consent!</p>
<p>[Exit]</p>
