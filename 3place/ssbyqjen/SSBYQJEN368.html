/</h4>
<p>Enter Tullus Aufidius with Attendants</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS Go tell the lords o’th’city I am here:</p>
<p>Deliver them this paper: having read it,</p>
<p>Bid them repair 1852 to th’market-place, where I,</p>
<p>Even in theirs and in the commons’ ears,</p>
<p>Will vouch the truth of it. Him 1853 I accuse</p>
<p>The city ports 1854 by this 1855 hath entered, and</p>
<p>Intends t’appear before the people, hoping</p>
<p>To purge himself with words. Dispatch.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Attendants ]</p>
<p>Enter three or four Conspirators of Aufidius’ faction</p>
<p>Most welcome.</p>
<p>FIRST CONSPIRATOR How is it with our general?</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS Even so as with a man by his own</p>
<p>Alms impoisoned, and with his 1856 charity slain.</p>
<p>SECOND CONSPIRATOR Most noble sir, if you do hold the same intent</p>
<p>Wherein you wished us parties 1857 , we’ll deliver you</p>
<p>Of 1858 your great danger.</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS Sir, I cannot tell:</p>
<p>We must proceed as we do find the people.</p>
<p>THIRD CONSPIRATOR The people will remain uncertain whilst</p>
<p>’Twixt you there’s difference 1859 : but the fall of either</p>
<p>Makes the survivor heir of all.</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS I know it,</p>
<p>And my pretext to strike at him admits 1860</p>
<p>A good construction 1861 . I raised him, and I pawned 1862</p>
<p>Mine honour for his truth 1863 : who being so heightened 1864 ,</p>
<p>He watered his new plants 1865 with dews of flattery,</p>
<p>Seducing so my friends: and to this end</p>
<p>He bowed his nature, never known before</p>
<p>But to be rough, unswayable, and free 1866 .</p>
<p>THIRD CONSPIRATOR Sir, his stoutness 1867</p>
<p>When he did stand for consul, which he lost</p>
<p>By lack of stooping—</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS That I would have spoke of 1868 :</p>
<p>Being banished for’t, he came unto my hearth,</p>
<p>Presented to my knife his throat: I took him,</p>
<p>Made him joint-servant 1869 with me, gave him way 1870</p>
<p>In all his own desires, nay, let him choose</p>
<p>Out of my files 1871 , his projects to accomplish,</p>
<p>My best and freshest men: served his designments 1872</p>
<p>In mine own person: holp 1873 to reap the fame</p>
<p>Which he did end 1874 all his, and took some pride</p>
<p>To do myself this wrong: till at the last</p>
<p>I seemed his follower, not partner, and</p>
<p>He waged 1875 me with his countenance 1876 , as if</p>
<p>I had been mercenary 1877 .</p>
<p>FIRST CONSPIRATOR So he did, my lord:</p>
<p>The army marvelled at it, and in 1878 the last,</p>
<p>When he had carried 1879 Rome and that we looked</p>
<p>For no less spoil than glory—</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS There was it 1880 ,</p>
<p>For which my sinews shall be stretched 1881 upon him.</p>
<p>At a few drops of women’s rheum 1882 , which are</p>
<p>As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour</p>
<p>Of our great action: therefore shall he die,</p>
<p>And I’ll renew me in his fall.</p>
<p>Drums and Trumpets sound, with great shouts of the people</p>
<p>But hark.</p>
<p>FIRST CONSPIRATOR Your native town you entered like a post 1883 ,</p>
<p>And had no welcomes home: but he returns</p>
<p>Splitting the air with noise.</p>
<p>SECOND CONSPIRATOR And patient fools,</p>
<p>Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear</p>
<p>With giving him glory.</p>
<p>THIRD CONSPIRATOR Therefore, at your vantage 1884 ,</p>
<p>Ere he express himself, or move the people</p>
<p>With what he would say, let him feel your sword,</p>
<p>Which we will second. When he lies along 1885 ,</p>
<p>After your way his tale pronounced 1886 shall bury</p>
<p>His reasons 1887 with his body.</p>
<p>Enter the Lords of the city</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS Say no more: here come the lords.</p>
<p>ALL THE LORDS You are most welcome home.</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS I have not deserved it.</p>
<p>But, worthy lords, have you with heed 1888 perused</p>
<p>What I have written to you?</p>
<p>ALL THE LORDS We have.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD And grieve to hear’t.</p>
<p>What faults he made before the last, I think</p>
<p>Might have found easy fines 1889 : but there to end</p>
<p>Where he was to begin, and give away</p>
<p>The benefit of our levies 1890 , answering 1891 us</p>
<p>With our own charge 1892 , making a treaty where</p>
<p>There was a yielding 1893 — this admits no excuse.</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS He approaches: you shall hear him.</p>
<p>Enter Coriolanus marching with Drum and Colours, the Commoners being
with him</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Hail, lords! I am returned your soldier,</p>
<p>No more infected with my country’s love</p>
<p>Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting</p>
<p>Under your great command. You are to know</p>
<p>That prosperously I have attempted 1894 and</p>
<p>With bloody passage led your wars even to</p>
<p>The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home</p>
<p>Doth more than counterpoise a full third part 1895</p>
<p>The charges 1896 of the action. We have made peace</p>
<p>With no less honour to the Antiates 1897</p>
<p>Than shame to th’Romans. And we here deliver,</p>
<p>Subscribed 1898 by th’consuls and patricians,</p>
<p>Together with the seal o’th’senate, what</p>
<p>We have compounded 1899 on.</p>
<p>He gives the Lords a paper</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS Read it not, noble lords,</p>
<p>But tell the traitor in the highest degree</p>
<p>He hath abused your powers.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Traitor? How now?</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS Ay, traitor, Martius.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Martius?</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS Ay, Martius, Caius Martius: dost thou think</p>
<p>I’ll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol’n name,</p>
<p>‘Coriolanus’ in Corioles?</p>
<p>You lords and heads o’th’state, perfidiously 1900</p>
<p>He has betrayed your business, and given up,</p>
<p>For certain drops of salt 1901 , your city Rome:</p>
<p>I say ‘your city’ to his wife and mother,</p>
<p>Breaking his oath and resolution like</p>
<p>A twist 1902 of rotten silk, never admitting</p>
<p>Counsel o’th’war 1903 : but at his nurse’s tears</p>
<p>He whined and roared away your victory,</p>
<p>That pages blushed at him and men of heart 1904</p>
<p>Looked wond’ring each at others.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Hear’st thou, Mars?</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS Name not the god, thou boy of tears.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Ha?</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS No more.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart</p>
<p>Too great for what contains it. Boy? O slave!—</p>
<p>Pardon me, lords, ’tis the first time that ever</p>
<p>I was forced to scold 1905 . Your judgements, my grave lords,</p>
<p>Must give this cur the lie 1906 : and his own notion 1907 —</p>
<p>Who wears my stripes 1908 impressed upon him, that</p>
<p>Must bear my beating to his grave — shall join</p>
<p>To thrust the lie unto him.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Peace, both, and hear me speak.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Cut me to pieces, Volsces: men and lads,</p>
<p>Stain all your edges 1909 on me. ‘Boy’! False hound,</p>
<p>If you have writ your annals true, ’tis there,</p>
<p>That, like an eagle in a dovecote, I</p>
<p>Fluttered 1910 your Volscians in Corioles.</p>
<p>Alone I did it. ‘Boy’!</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS Why, noble lords,</p>
<p>Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune 1911 ,</p>
<p>Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,</p>
<p>’Fore your own eyes and ears?</p>
<p>ALL CONSPIRATORS Let him die for’t.</p>
<p>ALL [THE] PEOPLE Tear him to pieces! Do it presently 1912 !</p>
<p>Shouting individually</p>
<p>He killed my son! My daughter! He killed my cousin</p>
<p>Marcus! He killed my father!</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Peace, ho! No outrage 1913 : peace!</p>
<p>The man is noble, and his fame folds in 1914</p>
<p>This orb o’th’earth. His last offences to us</p>
<p>Shall have judicious hearing 1915 . Stand 1916 , Aufidius,</p>
<p>And trouble not the peace.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS O that I had him, with six Aufidiuses,</p>
<p>Drawing his sword</p>
<p>Or more, his tribe, to use my lawful sword!</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS Insolent villain!</p>
<p>Drawing his sword</p>
<p>ALL CONSPIRATORS Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!</p>
<p>Draw both the Conspirators, and kill Martius, who falls: Aufidius
stands on him</p>
<p>LORDS Hold, hold, hold, hold!</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS My noble masters, hear me speak.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD O Tullus!</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Thou hast done a deed whereat 1917</p>
<p>To Aufidius</p>
<p>Valour will weep.</p>
<p>THIRD LORD Tread not upon him, masters:</p>
<p>To Aufidius and the Conspirators</p>
<p>All be quiet: put up your swords.</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS My lords,</p>
<p>When you shall know — as in this rage,</p>
<p>Provoked by him, you cannot — the great danger</p>
<p>Which this man’s life did owe 1918 you, you’ll rejoice</p>
<p>That he is thus cut off. Please it 1919 your honours</p>
<p>To call me to your senate, I’ll deliver 1920</p>
<p>Myself your loyal servant, or endure</p>
<p>Your heaviest censure 1921 .</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Bear from hence his body,</p>
<p>And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded</p>
<p>As the most noble corpse that ever herald</p>
<p>Did follow to his urn.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD His own impatience</p>
<p>Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.</p>
<p>Let’s make the best of it.</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS My rage is gone,</p>
<p>And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up:</p>
<p>Help three o’th’chiefest soldiers: I’ll be one 1922 .</p>
<p>Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:</p>
<p>Trail 1923 your steel pikes. Though in this city he</p>
<p>Hath widowed and unchilded many a one,</p>
<p>Which to this hour bewail the injury,</p>
<p>Yet he shall have a noble memory 1924 . Assist.</p>
<p>Exeunt bearing the body of Martius. A dead march 1925 sounded</p>
<p>Textual Notes</p>
<p>F = First Folio text of 1623, the only authority for the play</p>
<p>F2 = a correction introduced in the Second Folio text of 1632</p>
<p>F3 = a correction introduced in the Third Folio text of 1663–64</p>
<p>F4 = a correction introduced in the Fourth Folio text of 1685</p>
<p>Ed = a correction introduced by a later editor</p>
<p>SD = stage direction</p>
<p>SH = speech heading (i.e. speaker’s name)</p>
<p>List of parts = Ed</p>
<p>1.1.11 on = Ed. F = one 46 you. For = Ed. F = you for 69 stale’t =

<p>1.3.28 that’s = F2. F = that 35 sword, contemning . = Ed. F = sword.
Contenning , 70 yarn = Ed. F = yearne 71 Ithaca = Ed. F = Athica</p>
<p>1.4.36 boils = Ed. F = Byles 47 followed = F2. F = followes. Ed =
Follow/Follow me 50 SD gates = F2. F = Gati 52 SD is shut in this
direction is transferred from the end of the stage direction five lines
previously. It has been repositioned because Martius has lines to speak
after this direction in F; furthermore, the gates do not shut until the
soldier remarks upon it 63 left = F. Ed = lost 66 Cato’s = Ed. F =
Calues</p>
<p>1.5.4 honours = Ed. F = hours 7 them , = F3. F = them. 9 him . = F3.
F = him</p>
<p>1.6.6 The = F. Ed = Ye 63 Antiates = Ed. F = Antients. F could make
sense as ‘ancients’ is a common</p>
<p>spelling of ‘ensigns’; however, six lines later reference is made to
the ‘Antiats’, suggesting an earlier error 83 Lesser = F3. F = Lessen 97
I = Ed. F = foure</p>
<p>1.9.0 SD Flourish moved from before ‘Alarum’ since it should herald
the entry of the Romans 45 beheld = F. Ed = upheld 51 An overture = F.
Ed = a coverture/an ovator. If the coverture reading is preferred, it
would mean a ‘covering’, possibly signifying a special garment. Ovator
means ‘one who receives a public ovation’ 54 shout = Ed. F = shoot 70,
71 Martius = Ed. F = Marcus 72 SH CORIOLANUS = Ed. F = Martius (F speech
heading changes to Cor., Corio., Coriol. with effect from return to Rome
in Act 2 )</p>
<p>1.10.23 Embarquements = F. Ed = Embargements</p>
<p>2.1.11 SH SICINIUS and BRUTUS = Ed. F = Both. This emendation, for
the purposes of clarification, also occurs at lines 18 and 20 13 with
all = F3. F = withall 18 How are = F2. F = ho ware 41 can = F. Ed =
cannot. The Folio reading can be defended if one agrees that Menenius is
being sarcastic 44 tell you = F. Ed = tell you, you 46 bisson = Ed. F =
beesome 51 faucet = Ed. F = Forset 61 are. When … purpose it = F4. F =
are, when … purpose. It 66 Good e’en = Ed. F = Godden 76 SH VIRGILIA and
VALERIA = Ed. F = 2.Ladies . 111 SD A … flourish moved from F’s original
positioning after ‘Hark, the trumpets’ 120 ‘Coriolanus’ = Ed. F =
Martius Caius Coriolanus 136 wear = F2. F = were 139 SH CORIOLANUS = Ed.
F = Com . 180 gauded = F (gawded). Ed = guarded 214 authorities … end .

Ed = touch</p>
<p>2.2.55 SH FIRST SENATOR = Ed. F = Senat . 73 one on’s = Ed. F = on
ones 83 chin = F (Shinne) 100 took: … foot = Ed. F = tooke … foot: Ed =

<p>2.3.19 wedged = F (wadg’d) 25 it. I say, = Ed. F = it, I say. 28 all
together = F (altogether) 50 SD three = F. Ed = two . The speech
headings were also altered by Rowe, in keeping with the emendation 55
but not = Ed. F = but 70 SH FOURTH CITIZEN = Ed. F = I. This is to
distinguish between these two other citizens and the three who have just
exited 82 SH FIFTH CITIZEN = Ed. F = 2. 89 starve = Ed. F = sterue 90
hire = F2 (hier). F = higher 91 tongue = F. Ed = toge 108 SH SIXTH
CITIZEN = Ed. F = I.Cit . 109 SH SEVENTH CITIZEN = Ed. F = 2.Cit . 226
And … surnamed = Ed. Delius suggests inserting a line derived from
North’s ‘Plutarch’, possibly missed by the compositor’s eyeskip from And
to And .</p>
<p>3.1.5 road = F (roade). Ed = raid 38 SH FIRST SENATOR = Ed. F =
Senat. (throughout scene) 54 suppliants = F4. F = Suppliants: 60 SH

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain) . Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster, and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside ?(often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading’bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
