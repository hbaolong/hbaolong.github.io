<h4 id="scene-4-running-scene-7">Scene 4 ／ running scene 7</h4>
<p>Enter Angelo</p>
<p>ANGELO When I would pray and think, I think and pray</p>
<p>To several 563 subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,</p>
<p>Whilst my invention 564 , hearing not my tongue,</p>
<p>Anchors 565 on Isabel: heaven 566 in my mouth,</p>
<p>As if I did but only chew his name,</p>
<p>And in my heart the strong and swelling evil</p>
<p>Of my conception 567 . The state 568 whereon I studied</p>
<p>Is like a good thing, being often read,</p>
<p>Grown seared 569 and tedious: yea, my gravity 570 ,</p>
<p>Wherein — let no man hear me — I take pride,</p>
<p>Could I with boot 571 change 572 for an idle plume 573</p>
<p>Which the air beats for vain 574 . O place 575 , O form 576 ,</p>
<p>How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit 577 ,</p>
<p>Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls</p>
<p>To thy false seeming 578 ? Blood 579 , thou art blood.</p>
<p>Let’s 580 write good angel 581 on the devil’s horn —</p>
<p>’Tis not the devil’s crest 582 .</p>
<p>Enter [a ] Servant</p>
<p>How now? Who’s there?</p>
<p>SERVANT One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.</p>
<p>ANGELO Teach 583 her the way.</p>
<p>[Exit Servant ]</p>
<p>O heavens,</p>
<p>Why does my blood thus muster to 584 my heart,</p>
<p>Making both it unable for itself 585 ,</p>
<p>And dispossessing 586 all my other parts</p>
<p>Of necessary fitness?</p>
<p>So play the foolish throngs 587 with one that swoons,</p>
<p>Come all to help him, and so stop the air</p>
<p>By which he should revive: and even so</p>
<p>The general 588 , subject to a well-wished 589 king,</p>
<p>Quit their own part 590 and in obsequious fondness 591</p>
<p>Crowd to his presence, where their untaught 592 love</p>
<p>Must needs appear offence.</p>
<p>Enter Isabella</p>
<p>How now, fair maid?</p>
<p>ISABELLA I am come to know your pleasure.</p>
<p>ANGELO That you might know it would much better please me</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>Than to demand what ’tis 593 .— Your brother cannot live.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Even so 594 . Heaven keep your honour.</p>
<p>She starts to go</p>
<p>ANGELO Yet may he live awhile, and it may be</p>
<p>As long as you or I: yet he must die.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Under your sentence?</p>
<p>ANGELO Yea.</p>
<p>ISABELLA When, I beseech you? That in his reprieve 595 ,</p>
<p>Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted 596</p>
<p>That his soul sicken not.</p>
<p>ANGELO Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good</p>
<p>To pardon him that hath from nature stolen</p>
<p>A man already made 597 , as to remit 598</p>
<p>Their saucy sweetness 599 that do coin heaven’s image</p>
<p>In stamps 600 that are forbid 601 : ’tis all as easy</p>
<p>Falsely 602 to take away a life true 603 made</p>
<p>As to put mettle 604 in restrainèd 605 means</p>
<p>To make a false one.</p>
<p>ISABELLA ’Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth 606 .</p>
<p>ANGELO Say you so? Then I shall pose you 607 quickly.</p>
<p>Which had you rather, that the most just law</p>
<p>Now took your brother’s life, or, to redeem him,</p>
<p>Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness</p>
<p>As she that he hath stained?</p>
<p>ISABELLA Sir, believe this,</p>
<p>I had rather give my body than my soul.</p>
<p>ANGELO I talk not of your soul. Our compelled sins</p>
<p>Stand more for number than for account 608 .</p>
<p>ISABELLA How say you?</p>
<p>ANGELO Nay, I’ll not warrant 609 that, for I can speak</p>
<p>Against the thing I say. Answer to this:</p>
<p>I, now the voice of the recorded law,</p>
<p>Pronounce a sentence on your brother’s life.</p>
<p>Might there not be a charity in sin</p>
<p>To save this brother’s life?</p>
<p>ISABELLA Please 610 you to do’t,</p>
<p>I’ll take it as a peril to my soul 611 ,</p>
<p>It is no sin at all, but charity.</p>
<p>ANGELO Pleased you to do’t at peril of your soul,</p>
<p>Were equal poise 612 of sin and charity.</p>
<p>ISABELLA That I do beg his life, if it be sin,</p>
<p>Heaven let me bear it. You granting of my suit,</p>
<p>If that be sin, I’ll make it my morn 613 prayer</p>
<p>To have it added to the faults of mine,</p>
<p>And nothing of your answer 614 .</p>
<p>ANGELO Nay, but hear me.</p>
<p>Your sense 615 pursues not mine: either you are ignorant 616 ,</p>
<p>Or seem so crafty 617 , and that’s not good.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,</p>
<p>But graciously 618 to know I am no better.</p>
<p>ANGELO Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright</p>
<p>When it doth tax 619 itself, as these black masks 620</p>
<p>Proclaim an enshield 621 beauty ten times louder</p>
<p>Than beauty could, displayed. But mark 622 me,</p>
<p>To be receivèd 623 plain, I’ll speak more gross 624 :</p>
<p>Your brother is to die.</p>
<p>ISABELLA So.</p>
<p>ANGELO And his offence is so, as it appears 625 ,</p>
<p>Accountant 626 to the law upon that pain 627 .</p>
<p>ISABELLA True.</p>
<p>ANGELO Admit 628 no other way to save his life —</p>
<p>As I subscribe not 629 that, nor any other,</p>
<p>But in the loss of question 630 — that you, his sister,</p>
<p>Finding yourself desired of such a person,</p>
<p>Whose credit 631 with the judge, or own great place 632 ,</p>
<p>Could fetch your brother from the manacles</p>
<p>Of the all-building 633 law, and that there were</p>
<p>No earthly mean to save him, but that either</p>
<p>You must lay down the treasures of your body 634</p>
<p>To this supposed 635 , or else to let him suffer:</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p>ISABELLA As much for my poor brother as myself:</p>
<p>That is, were I under the terms 636 of death,</p>
<p>Th’impression 637 of keen 638 whips I’d wear as rubies,</p>
<p>And strip 639 myself to death, as to a bed</p>
<p>That longing have been sick for, ere I’d yield</p>
<p>My body up to shame.</p>
<p>ANGELO Then must your brother die.</p>
<p>ISABELLA And ’twere the cheaper way.</p>
<p>Better it were a brother died at once,</p>
<p>Than that a sister by redeeming him</p>
<p>Should die for ever 640 .</p>
<p>ANGELO Were not you then as cruel as the sentence</p>
<p>That you have slandered so?</p>
<p>ISABELLA Ignomy in ransom and free pardon</p>
<p>Are of two houses 641 . Lawful mercy</p>
<p>Is nothing kin 642 to foul redemption.</p>
<p>ANGELO You seemed of late to make the law a tyrant,</p>
<p>And rather proved the sliding 643 of your brother</p>
<p>A merriment 644 than a vice.</p>
<p>ISABELLA O pardon me, my lord, it oft falls out 645</p>
<p>To have what we would 646 have, we speak not what we mean.</p>
<p>I something 647 do excuse the thing I hate,</p>
<p>For his advantage that I dearly love.</p>
<p>ANGELO We are all frail.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Else 648 let my brother die,</p>
<p>If not a fedary 649 , but only he</p>
<p>Owe and succeed thy weakness 650 .</p>
<p>ANGELO Nay, women are frail too.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,</p>
<p>Which are as easy broke as they make forms 651 .</p>
<p>Women? Help heaven! 652 Men their creation mar</p>
<p>In profiting by them 653 . Nay, call us ten times frail,</p>
<p>For we are soft as our complexions are,</p>
<p>And credulous to false prints 654 .</p>
<p>ANGELO I think it well 655 .</p>
<p>And from this testimony of your own sex —</p>
<p>Since I suppose 656 we are made to be no stronger</p>
<p>Than faults may shake our frames 657 — let me be bold.</p>
<p>I do arrest your words. Be that 658 you are,</p>
<p>That is, a woman; if you be more, you’re none 659 .</p>
<p>If you be one, as you are well expressed</p>
<p>By all external warrants 660 , show it now,</p>
<p>By putting on the destined livery 661 .</p>
<p>ISABELLA I have no tongue but one 662 . Gentle my lord,</p>
<p>Let me entreat you speak the former language 663 .</p>
<p>ANGELO Plainly conceive 664 I love you.</p>
<p>ISABELLA My brother did love Juliet,</p>
<p>And you tell me that he shall die for’t.</p>
<p>ANGELO He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.</p>
<p>ISABELLA I know your virtue hath a licence 665 in’t,</p>
<p>Which seems a little fouler than it is,</p>
<p>To pluck on 666 others.</p>
<p>ANGELO Believe me, on mine honour,</p>
<p>My words express my purpose.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Ha! Little honour to be much believed,</p>
<p>And most pernicious 667 purpose! Seeming 668 , seeming!</p>
<p>I will proclaim 669 thee, Angelo, look for’t.</p>
<p>Sign me a present 670 pardon for my brother,</p>
<p>Or with an outstretched 671 throat I’ll tell the world aloud</p>
<p>What 672 man thou art.</p>
<p>ANGELO Who will believe thee, Isabel?</p>
<p>My unsoiled name, th’austereness 673 of my life,</p>
<p>My vouch 674 against you, and my place i’th’state,</p>
<p>Will so your accusation overweigh,</p>
<p>That you shall stifle 675 in your own report 676</p>
<p>And smell of calumny 677 . I have begun,</p>
<p>And now I give my sensual race the rein 678 :</p>
<p>Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite,</p>
<p>Lay by 679 all nicety and prolixious 680 blushes</p>
<p>That banish what they sue for 681 . Redeem thy brother</p>
<p>By yielding up thy body to my will,</p>
<p>Or else he must not only die the death,</p>
<p>But thy unkindness 682 shall his death draw out</p>
<p>To ling’ring sufferance 683 . Answer me tomorrow,</p>
<p>Or, by the affection 684 that now guides me most,</p>
<p>I’ll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,</p>
<p>Say what you can; my false o’erweighs your true.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>ISABELLA To whom should I complain? Did I 685 tell this,</p>
<p>Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,</p>
<p>That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,</p>
<p>Either of condemnation or approof 686 ,</p>
<p>Bidding the law make curtsy 687 to their will,</p>
<p>Hooking both right and wrong to th’appetite,</p>
<p>To follow as it draws 688 ! I’ll to my brother.</p>
<p>Though he hath fallen by prompture 689 of the blood 690 ,</p>
<p>Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour</p>
<p>That, had he twenty heads to tender down 691</p>
<p>On twenty bloody blocks 692 , he’d yield them up</p>
<p>Before his sister should her body stoop</p>
<p>To such abhorred pollution.</p>
<p>Then Isabel, live chaste, and brother, die;</p>
<p>More 693 than our brother is our chastity.</p>
<p>I’ll tell him yet of Angelo’s request,</p>
<p>And fit 694 his mind to death, for his soul’s rest.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
