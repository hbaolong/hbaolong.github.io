16</h4>
<p>Enter the two French Captains [the Lords Dumaine ] and some two or
three Soldiers</p>
<p>FIRST LORD You have not given him his mother’s letter?</p>
<p>SECOND LORD I have delivered it an hour since 1329 : there is
something in’t that stings his nature, for on the reading it he changed
almost into another man.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD He has much worthy 1330 blame laid upon him for shaking
off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure
of the king, who had even tuned his bounty 1331 to sing happiness to
him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly 1332
with you.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD When you have spoken it, ’tis dead, and I am the grave of
it.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD He hath perverted 1333 a young gentlewoman here in
Florence, of a most chaste renown, and this night he fleshes 1334 his
will 1335 in the spoil 1336 of her honour. He hath given her his
monumental 1337 ring, and thinks himself made 1338 in the unchaste
composition 1339 .</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Now, God delay 1340 our rebellion 1341 ! As we are
ourselves 1342 , what things are we!</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Merely 1343 our own traitors. And as in the common course
of all treasons, we still 1344 see them reveal themselves 1345 , till
they attain to 1346 their abhorred ends 1347 , so he 1348 that in this
action contrives 1349 against his own nobility, in his proper stream
1350 o’erflows himself.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Is it not meant 1351 damnable in us, to be trumpeters of
our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company tonight?</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Not till after midnight, for he is dieted to his hour
1352 .</p>
<p>FIRST LORD That approaches apace 1353 . I would gladly have him see
his company 1354 anatomized 1355 , that he might take a measure of his
own judgements, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit 1356
.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD We will not meddle with him 1357 till he come, for his
1358 presence must be the whip of the other 1359 .</p>
<p>FIRST LORD In the meantime, what hear you of these wars?</p>
<p>SECOND LORD I hear there is an overture 1360 of peace.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD What will Count Rossillion do then? Will he travel higher
1361 , or return again into France?</p>
<p>FIRST LORD I perceive by this demand 1362 , you are not altogether of
his council 1363 .</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal of his
act 1364 .</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house.
Her pretence 1365 is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy
undertaking with most austere sanctimony 1366 she accomplished. And
there residing, the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in
heaven.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD How is this justified 1367 ?</p>
<p>FIRST LORD The stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes
her story true, even to the point of her death. Her death itself, which
could not be her office 1368 to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
the rector 1369 of the place.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Hath the count all this intelligence?</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to
the full arming 1370 of the verity 1371 .</p>
<p>SECOND LORD I am heartily sorry that he’ll be glad of this.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of 1372 our
losses!</p>
<p>SECOND LORD And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in
tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him
shall at home be encountered 1373 with a shame as ample.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill
together: our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not; and
our crimes would despair if they were not cherished 1374 by our
virtues.</p>
<p>Enter a [Servant as a ] Messenger</p>
<p>How now! Where’s your master?</p>
<p>SERVANT He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath taken a
solemn 1375 leave: his lordship will next morning for 1376 France. The
duke hath offered 1377 him letters of commendations to the king.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD They shall be no more than needful 1378 there, if 1379
they were more than they can commend 1380 .</p>
<p>Enter Count Rossillion [Bertram ]</p>
<p>FIRST LORD They cannot be too sweet for the king’s tartness. Here’s
his lordship now.— How now, my lord! Is’t not after midnight?</p>
<p>BERTRAM I have tonight dispatched 1381 sixteen businesses, a month’s
length apiece, by an abstract of success 1382 : I have congied with 1383
the duke, done my adieu with his nearest 1384 , buried a wife, mourned
for her, writ to my lady mother I am returning, entertained my convoy
1385 and between these main parcels of dispatch 1386 effected many nicer
1387 needs. The last was the greatest, but that I have not ended
yet.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD If the business be of any difficulty, and this morning
your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.</p>
<p>BERTRAM I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it
1388 hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the
soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module 1389 , h’as deceived
me like a double-meaning prophesier 1390 .</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Bring him forth.</p>
<p>To Soldiers</p>
<p>H’as sat i’th’stocks 1391 all night, poor gallant 1392 knave.</p>
<p>[Exit some Soldiers ]</p>
<p>BERTRAM No matter. His heels have deserved it in usurping 1393 his
spurs 1394 so long. How does he carry 1395 himself?</p>
<p>SECOND LORD I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry him.
But to answer you as you would be understood: he weeps like a wench that
had shed 1396 her milk, he hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he
supposes to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance 1397 to this
very instant disaster 1398 of his setting i’th’stocks. And what think
you he hath confessed?</p>
<p>BERTRAM Nothing of me, has a 1399 ?</p>
<p>SECOND LORD His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
face: if your lordship be in’t, as I believe you are, you must have the
patience to hear it.</p>
<p>Enter Parolles [blindfolded ] with his Interpreter</p>
<p>BERTRAM A plague upon him! Muffled? He can say nothing of me. Hush,
hush.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Hoodman 1400 comes! Portotartarossa .</p>
<p>INTERPRETER He calls for the tortures. What will you say without
’em?</p>
<p>PAROLLES I will confess what I know without constraint 1401 . If ye
pinch me like a pasty 1402 , I can say no more.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER Bosko chimurch o.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Boblibindo chicurmurco .</p>
<p>INTERPRETER You are a merciful general. Our general bids you answer
to what I shall ask you out of a note 1403 .</p>
<p>PAROLLES And truly, as I hope to live.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER ‘First demand of him how many horse 1404 the duke is
strong 1405 .’ What say you to that?</p>
<p>Pretends to read</p>
<p>PAROLLES Five or six thousand, but very weak and unserviceable. The
troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my
reputation and credit and as I hope to live.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER Shall I set down your answer so?</p>
<p>PAROLLES Do. I’ll take the sacrament 1406 on’t, how and which 1407
way you will.</p>
<p>Bertram and the Lords speak aside throughout</p>
<p>BERTRAM All’s one 1408 to him. What a past-saving 1409 slave is
this?</p>
<p>FIRST LORD You’re deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur Parolles, the
gallant militarist</p>
<p>— that was his own phrase — that had the whole theoric 1410 of war in
the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the chape 1411 of his
dagger.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
clean 1412 , nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his
apparel neatly.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER Well, that’s set down.</p>
<p>To Parolles</p>
<p>PAROLLES ‘Five or six thousand horse,’ I said—I will say true—‘or
thereabouts’, set down, for I’ll speak truth.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD He’s very near the truth in this.</p>
<p>BERTRAM But I con 1413 him no thanks for’t, in the nature 1414 he
delivers it.</p>
<p>PAROLLES ‘Poor rogues’, I pray you say.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER Well, that’s set down.</p>
<p>PAROLLES I humbly thank you, sir. A truth’s a truth, the rogues are
marvellous 1415 poor.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER ‘Demand of him, of what strength they are a-foot 1416 .’
What say you to that?</p>
<p>Pretends to read</p>
<p>PAROLLES By my troth, sir, if I were to live 1417 this present hour,
I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty: Sebastian, so
1418 many: Corambus, so many: Jaques, so many: Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick
and Gratii, two hundred fifty each: mine own company, Chitopher,
Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred fifty each. So that the muster-file 1419 ,
rotten and sound 1420 , upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand
poll 1421 , half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their
cassocks 1422 , lest they shake themselves to pieces.</p>
<p>BERTRAM What shall be done to him?</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
condition 1423 , and what credit I have with the duke.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER Well, that’s set down. ‘You shall demand of him, whether
one Captain Dumaine be i’th’camp, a Frenchman, what his reputation is
with the duke, what his valour, honesty, and expertness in wars, or
whether he thinks it were not possible, with well-weighing 1424 sums of
gold, to corrupt him to a revolt.’ What say you to this? What do you
know of it?</p>
<p>Pretends to read</p>
<p>PAROLLES I beseech you let me answer to the particular 1425 of the
inter’gatories 1426 : demand them singly.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER Do you know this Captain Dumaine?</p>
<p>PAROLLES I know him: a was a botcher 1427 ’s ’prentice 1428 in Paris,
from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve’s fool 1429 with
child — a dumb innocent 1430 that could not say him nay 1431 .</p>
<p>First Lord attempts to hit Parolles</p>
<p>BERTRAM Nay, by your leave, hold your hands, though I know his brains
are forfeit to the next tile that falls 1432 .</p>
<p>INTERPRETER Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florence’s camp?</p>
<p>PAROLLES Upon my knowledge he is, and lousy 1433 .</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Nay look not so upon me. We shall hear of your lord
anon.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER What is his reputation with the duke?</p>
<p>PAROLLES The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine,
and writ to me this other day to turn him out o’th’band 1434 . I think I
have his letter in my pocket.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER Marry, we’ll search.</p>
<p>They search his pockets</p>
<p>PAROLLES In good sadness 1435 , I do not know. Either it is there, or
it is upon a file with the duke’s other letters in my tent.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER Here ’tis. Here’s a paper. Shall I read it to you?</p>
<p>PAROLLES I do not know if it be it or no.</p>
<p>BERTRAM Our interpreter does it well.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Excellently.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER ‘Dian, the count’s a fool, and full of gold’—</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>PAROLLES That is not the duke’s letter, sir. That is an advertisement
1436 to a proper 1437 maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the
allurement of one Count Rossillion, a foolish idle boy, but for all that
very ruttish 1438 . I pray you, sir, put it up 1439 again.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER Nay, I’ll read it first, by your favour 1440 .</p>
<p>PAROLLES My meaning in’t, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of
the maid, for I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious
boy, who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry 1441 it
finds.</p>
<p>BERTRAM Damnable both-sides 1442 rogue!</p>
<p>INTERPRETER</p>
<p>[Reads the ] letter</p>
<p>’When he swears oaths, bid him drop 1443 gold, and take it.</p>
<p>After he scores 1444 , he never pays the score.</p>
<p>Half won is match well made, match and well make it 1445 ;</p>
<p>He ne’er pays after-debts 1446 , take it 1447 before.</p>
<p>And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:</p>
<p>Men are to mell 1448 with, boys are not to kiss.</p>
<p>For count 1449 of this, the count’s a fool, I know it,</p>
<p>Who pays before 1450 , but not when he does owe it.</p>
<p>Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear, Parolles.’</p>
<p>BERTRAM He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in’s
1451 forehead.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist
1452 and the armipotent 1453 soldier.</p>
<p>BERTRAM I could endure anything before but a cat, and now he’s a cat
to me.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER I perceive, sir, by the general’s looks, we shall be fain
1454 to hang you.</p>
<p>PAROLLES My life, sir, in any case. Not that I am afraid to die, but
that, my offences being many, I would repent out the remainder of nature
1455 . Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i’th’stocks, or anywhere, so I
may live.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER We’ll see what may be done, so you confess freely:
therefore, once more to this Captain Dumaine. You have answered to his
reputation with the duke and to his valour. What is his honesty?</p>
<p>PAROLLES He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister 1456 , for
rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus 1457 . He professes not 1458
keeping of oaths, in breaking ’em he is stronger than Hercules 1459 . He
will lie, sir, with such volubility that you would think truth were a
fool. Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk 1460 ,
and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bed-clothes about him.
But they 1461 know his conditions 1462 and lay him in straw. I have but
little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has everything that an
honest man should not have; what an honest man should have, he has
nothing.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD I begin to love him for this.</p>
<p>BERTRAM For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him for me.
He’s more and more a cat.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER What say you to his expertness in war?</p>
<p>PAROLLES Faith, sir, h’as led the drum before the English tragedians
1463 —to belie 1464 him, I will not — and more of his soldiership I know
not, except, in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a
place there called Mile-end 1465 , to instruct for the doubling of files
1466 . I would do the man what honour I can, but of this I am not
certain.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD He hath out-villained villainy so far that the rarity
redeems him.</p>
<p>BERTRAM A pox on him, he’s a cat still.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER His qualities being at this poor price, I need not to ask
you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Sir, for a cardecue 1467 he will sell the fee-simple 1468 of
his salvation, the inheritance of it, and cut th’entail from all
remainders, and a perpetual succession for it perpetually 1469 .</p>
<p>INTERPRETER What’s his brother, the other Captain Dumaine?</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Why does he ask him of me?</p>
<p>INTERPRETER What’s he?</p>
<p>PAROLLES E’en a crow o’th’same nest: not altogether so great as the
first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He excels his
brother for 1470 a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best
that is. In a retreat he outruns any lackey 1471 ; marry, in coming on
1472 he has the cramp.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the
Florentine?</p>
<p>PAROLLES Ay, and the captain of his horse 1473 , Count
Rossillion.</p>
<p>INTERPRETER I’ll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.</p>
<p>PAROLLES I’ll no more 1474 drumming. A plague of all drums! Only to
seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition 1475 of that
lascivious young boy, the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who
would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>INTERPRETER There is no remedy, sir, but you must die. The general
says, you that have so traitorously discovered 1476 the secrets of your
army and made such pestiferous 1477 reports of men very nobly held 1478
, can serve the world for no honest use: therefore you 1479 must die.
Come, headsman, off with his head.</p>
<p>PAROLLES O lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!</p>
<p>FIRST LORD That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.
So, look about you: know you any here?</p>
<p>Unblindfolds him</p>
<p>BERTRAM Good morrow, noble captain.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD God bless you, Captain Parolles.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD God save you, noble captain.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafew? I am
for 1480 France.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet you
writ to Diana in 1481 behalf of the Count Rossillion? An I were not a
very 1482 coward, I’d compel it of you. But fare you well.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Bertram and Lords ]</p>
<p>INTERPRETER You are undone 1483 , captain — all but 1484 your scarf
that has a knot on’t yet.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Who cannot be crushed with a plot?</p>
<p>INTERPRETER If you could find out a country where but women were that
had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent 1485 nation.
Fare ye well, sir. I am for France too. We shall speak of you there.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Interpreter and Soldiers ]</p>
<p>PAROLLES Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great 1486</p>
<p>’Twould burst at this. Captain I’ll be no more,</p>
<p>But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft</p>
<p>As captain shall. Simply the thing I am</p>
<p>Shall make me live. Who 1487 knows himself a braggart,</p>
<p>Let him fear this; for it will come to pass</p>
<p>That every braggart shall be found an ass.</p>
<p>Rust, sword. Cool, blushes. And, Parolles, live</p>
<p>Safest in shame. Being fooled 1488 , by fool’ry thrive;</p>
<p>There’s place and means for every man alive.</p>
<p>I’ll after them.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
