<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-11">Scene 1 ／ running scene 11</h4>
<p>Enter Prince [Don Pedro, Don John the ] Bastard, Leonato, Friar
[Francis ], Claudio, Benedick, Hero and Beatrice [and Attendants ]</p>
<p>LEONATO Come, Friar Francis, be brief: only to the plain form of
marriage, and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards.</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO No.</p>
<p>LEONATO To be married to her. Friar, you come to marry her.</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.</p>
<p>HERO I do.</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS If either of you know any inward 759 impediment why you
should not be conjoined, I charge you on your souls to utter it.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Know you any, Hero?</p>
<p>HERO None, my lord.</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS Know you any, Count?</p>
<p>LEONATO I dare make his answer, none.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO O, what men dare do! What men may do! What men daily do, not
knowing what they do!</p>
<p>BENEDICK How now? Interjections? Why then, some be of laughing, as
ha, ha, he!</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Stand thee by 760 , friar. Father, by your leave 761 :</p>
<p>Will you with free and unconstrainèd soul</p>
<p>Give me this maid, your daughter?</p>
<p>LEONATO As freely, son, as God did give her me.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO And what have I to give you back whose worth</p>
<p>May counterpoise 762 this rich and precious gift?</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Nothing, unless you render her again 763 .</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Sweet prince, you learn 764 me noble thankfulness.</p>
<p>There, Leonato, take her back again.</p>
<p>Hands Hero to Leonato</p>
<p>Give not this rotten orange to your friend.</p>
<p>She’s but the sign and semblance 765 of her honour.</p>
<p>Behold how like a maid she blushes here.</p>
<p>O, what authority and show of truth</p>
<p>Can cunning sin cover itself withal 766 !</p>
<p>Comes not that blood 767 as modest evidence</p>
<p>To witness 768 simple virtue? Would you not swear,</p>
<p>All you that see her, that she were a maid,</p>
<p>By these exterior shows? But she is none.</p>
<p>She knows the heat of a luxurious 769 bed:</p>
<p>Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.</p>
<p>LEONATO What do you mean, my lord?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Not to be married,</p>
<p>Not to knit my soul to an approvèd 770 wanton.</p>
<p>LEONATO Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof 771 ,</p>
<p>Have vanquished the resistance of her youth,</p>
<p>And made defeat of her virginity—</p>
<p>CLAUDIO I know what you would say: if I have known 772 her,</p>
<p>You will say she did embrace me as a husband,</p>
<p>And so extenuate the ’forehand sin 773 .</p>
<p>No, Leonato,</p>
<p>I never tempted her with word too large 774 ,</p>
<p>But, as a brother to his sister, showed</p>
<p>Bashful 775 sincerity and comely 776 love.</p>
<p>HERO And seemed I ever otherwise to you?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Out on thee, seeming! I will write against it 777 .</p>
<p>You seem to me as Dian in her orb 778 ,</p>
<p>As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown 779 .</p>
<p>But you are more intemperate 780 in your blood 781</p>
<p>Than Venus 782 or those pampered animals</p>
<p>That rage in savage sensuality.</p>
<p>HERO Is my lord well that he doth speak so wide 783 ?</p>
<p>LEONATO Sweet prince, why speak not you?</p>
<p>DON PEDRO What should I speak?</p>
<p>I stand dishonoured, that have gone about</p>
<p>To link my dear friend to a common stale 784 .</p>
<p>LEONATO Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?</p>
<p>DON JOHN Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.</p>
<p>BENEDICK This looks not like a nuptial.</p>
<p>HERO ‘True’? O God!</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Leonato, stand I here?</p>
<p>Is this the prince? Is this the prince’s brother?</p>
<p>Is this face Hero’s? Are our eyes our own?</p>
<p>LEONATO All this is so, but what of this, my lord?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Let me but move 785 one question to your daughter,</p>
<p>And by that fatherly and kindly 786 power</p>
<p>That you have in her, bid her answer truly.</p>
<p>LEONATO I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.</p>
<p>To Hero</p>
<p>HERO O, God defend me, how am I beset 787 !</p>
<p>What kind of catechizing 788 call you this?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO To make you answer truly to your name 789 .</p>
<p>HERO Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name</p>
<p>With any just reproach?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Marry, that can Hero:</p>
<p>Hero itself can blot out Hero’s virtue.</p>
<p>What man was he talked with you yesternight,</p>
<p>Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?</p>
<p>Now if you are a maid, answer to this.</p>
<p>HERO I talked with no man at that hour, my lord.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Why, then you are no maiden. Leonato,</p>
<p>I am sorry you must hear. Upon mine honour,</p>
<p>Myself, my brother and this grievèd 790 count</p>
<p>Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night,</p>
<p>Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window,</p>
<p>Who hath indeed, most like a liberal 791 villain,</p>
<p>Confessed the vile encounters they have had</p>
<p>A thousand times in secret.</p>
<p>DON JOHN Fie, fie, they are not to be named, my lord,</p>
<p>Not to be spoken of.</p>
<p>There is not chastity enough in language</p>
<p>Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,</p>
<p>I am sorry for thy much misgovernment 792 .</p>
<p>CLAUDIO O Hero! What a Hero hadst thou been,</p>
<p>If half thy outward graces 793 had been placed</p>
<p>About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!</p>
<p>But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! Farewell,</p>
<p>Thou pure impiety and impious purity!</p>
<p>For 794 thee I’ll lock up all the gates of love,</p>
<p>And on my eyelids shall conjecture 795 hang,</p>
<p>To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,</p>
<p>And never shall it more be gracious 796 .</p>
<p>LEONATO Hath no man’s dagger here a point for me?</p>
<p>Hero swoons</p>
<p>BEATRICE Why, how now, cousin! Wherefore sink you down?</p>
<p>DON JOHN Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,</p>
<p>Smother her spirits 797 up.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Don Pedro, Don John and Claudio ]</p>
<p>BENEDICK How doth the lady?</p>
<p>BEATRICE Dead, I think. Help, uncle!</p>
<p>Hero! Why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!</p>
<p>LEONATO O fate! Take not away thy heavy hand.</p>
<p>Death is the fairest cover for her shame</p>
<p>That may be wished for.</p>
<p>BEATRICE How now, cousin Hero!</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS Have comfort, lady.</p>
<p>LEONATO Dost thou look up 798 ?</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS Yea, wherefore should she not?</p>
<p>LEONATO Wherefore? Why, doth not every earthly thing</p>
<p>Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny</p>
<p>The story that is printed in her blood?</p>
<p>Do not live, Hero, do not ope thine eyes,</p>
<p>For did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,</p>
<p>Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,</p>
<p>Myself would on the rearward of reproaches 799</p>
<p>Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one? 800</p>
<p>Chid 801 I for that at frugal nature’s frame 802 ?</p>
<p>O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?</p>
<p>Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?</p>
<p>Why had I not with charitable hand</p>
<p>Took up a beggar’s issue at my gates,</p>
<p>Who smearèd thus, and mired 803 with infamy 804 ,</p>
<p>I might have said ’No part of it is mine:</p>
<p>This shame derives itself from unknown loins’?</p>
<p>But mine, and mine I loved, and mine I praised,</p>
<p>And mine that I was proud on, mine so much</p>
<p>That I myself was to myself not mine,</p>
<p>Valuing of her 805 — why, she, O, she is fallen</p>
<p>Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea</p>
<p>Hath drops too few to wash her clean again,</p>
<p>And salt too little which may season 806 give</p>
<p>To her foul-tainted flesh!</p>
<p>BENEDICK Sir, sir, be patient.</p>
<p>For my part, I am so attired 807 in wonder,</p>
<p>I know not what to say.</p>
<p>BEATRICE O, on my soul my cousin is belied 808 !</p>
<p>BENEDICK Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?</p>
<p>BEATRICE No, truly not: although until last night,</p>
<p>I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.</p>
<p>LEONATO Confirmed, confirmed! O, that is stronger made</p>
<p>Which was before barred up with ribs of iron.</p>
<p>Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,</p>
<p>Who loved her so that, speaking of her foulness,</p>
<p>Washed it with tears? Hence from her, let her die.</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS Hear me a little:</p>
<p>For I have only been silent so long,</p>
<p>And given way 809 unto this course of fortune,</p>
<p>By noting of the lady. I have marked</p>
<p>A thousand blushing apparitions 810</p>
<p>To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames</p>
<p>In angel whiteness beat away those blushes,</p>
<p>And in her eye there hath appeared a fire</p>
<p>To burn the errors that these princes hold</p>
<p>Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool,</p>
<p>Trust not my reading nor my observations,</p>
<p>Which with experimental seal doth warrant</p>
<p>The tenure of my book 811 : trust not my age,</p>
<p>My reverence 812 , calling, nor divinity 813 ,</p>
<p>If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here</p>
<p>Under some biting 814 error.</p>
<p>LEONATO Friar, it cannot be.</p>
<p>Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left</p>
<p>Is that she will not add to her damnation</p>
<p>A sin of perjury 815 : she not denies it.</p>
<p>Why seek’st thou then to cover with excuse</p>
<p>That which appears in proper 816 nakedness?</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS Lady, what man is he you are accused of?</p>
<p>HERO They know that do accuse me: I know none.</p>
<p>If I know more of any man alive</p>
<p>Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant 817 ,</p>
<p>Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,</p>
<p>Prove you that any man with me conversed</p>
<p>At hours unmeet 818 , or that I yesternight</p>
<p>Maintained the change 819 of words with any creature,</p>
<p>Refuse 820 me, hate me, torture me to death!</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS There is some strange misprision 821 in the
princes.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Two of them have the very bent of 822 honour,</p>
<p>And if their wisdoms be misled in this,</p>
<p>The practice 823 of it lives in John the bastard,</p>
<p>Whose spirits toil in frame 824 of villainies.</p>
<p>LEONATO I know not. If they speak but truth of her,</p>
<p>These hands shall tear her. If they wrong her honour,</p>
<p>The proudest 825 of them shall well hear of it.</p>
<p>Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,</p>
<p>Nor age so eat 826 up my invention 827 ,</p>
<p>Nor fortune made such havoc of my means 828 ,</p>
<p>Nor my bad life reft 829 me so much of friends,</p>
<p>But they shall find, awaked in such a kind 830 ,</p>
<p>Both strength of limb and policy 831 of mind,</p>
<p>Ability in means and choice of friends,</p>
<p>To quit me of them throughly 832 .</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS Pause awhile,</p>
<p>And let my counsel sway you in this case.</p>
<p>Your daughter here the princes left for dead:</p>
<p>Let her awhile be secretly kept in,</p>
<p>And publish 833 it that she is dead indeed.</p>
<p>Maintain a mourning ostentation 834 ,</p>
<p>And on your family’s old monument 835</p>
<p>Hang mournful epitaphs, and do all rites</p>
<p>That appertain unto a burial.</p>
<p>LEONATO What shall become of this? What will this do?</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS Marry, this well carried 836 shall on her behalf</p>
<p>Change slander to remorse, that 837 is some good.</p>
<p>But not for that dream I on this strange course,</p>
<p>But on this travail 838 look for greater birth.</p>
<p>She dying, as it must so be maintained,</p>
<p>Upon the instant that she was accused,</p>
<p>Shall be lamented, pitied and excused</p>
<p>Of every hearer, for it so falls out</p>
<p>That what we have we prize not to the worth 839</p>
<p>Whiles we enjoy it; but, being lacked and lost,</p>
<p>Why, then we rack 840 the value, then we find</p>
<p>The virtue that possession would not show us</p>
<p>Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:</p>
<p>When he shall hear she died upon his words,</p>
<p>Th’idea of her life shall sweetly creep</p>
<p>Into his study of imagination 841 ,</p>
<p>And every lovely organ 842 of her life</p>
<p>Shall come apparelled 843 in more precious habit 844 ,</p>
<p>More moving-delicate and full of life,</p>
<p>Into the eye and prospect 845 of his soul</p>
<p>Than when she lived indeed. Then shall he mourn —</p>
<p>If ever love had interest 846 in his liver 847 —</p>
<p>And wish he had not so accusèd her,</p>
<p>No, though he thought his accusation true.</p>
<p>Let this be so, and doubt not but success 848</p>
<p>Will fashion the event 849 in better shape</p>
<p>Than I can lay it down in likelihood 850 .</p>
<p>But if all aim but this be levelled false 851 ,</p>
<p>The supposition of the lady’s death</p>
<p>Will quench the wonder of 852 her infamy.</p>
<p>And if it sort 853 not well, you may conceal her,</p>
<p>As best befits her wounded reputation,</p>
<p>In some reclusive and religious life,</p>
<p>Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries 854 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you.</p>
<p>And though you know my inwardness 855 and love</p>
<p>Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,</p>
<p>Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this</p>
<p>As secretly and justly as your soul</p>
<p>Should with your body.</p>
<p>LEONATO Being that 856 I flow in grief 857 ,</p>
<p>The smallest twine 858 may lead me.</p>
<p>FRIAR FRANCIS ’Tis well consented. Presently away,</p>
<p>For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure 859 .</p>
<p>Come, lady, die to live. This wedding day</p>
<p>Perhaps is but prolonged. Have patience and endure.</p>
<p>Exeunt [all but Benedick and Beatrice ]</p>
<p>BENEDICK Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?</p>
<p>BEATRICE Yea, and I will weep a while longer.</p>
<p>BENEDICK I will not desire that.</p>
<p>BEATRICE You have no reason, I do it freely.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right
her.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Is there any way to show such friendship?</p>
<p>BEATRICE A very even 860 way, but no such friend 861 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK May a man do it?</p>
<p>BEATRICE It is a man’s office, but not yours.</p>
<p>BENEDICK I do love nothing in the world so well as you. Is not that
strange?</p>
<p>BEATRICE As strange as the thing I know not. It were as possible for
me to say I loved nothing so well as you, but believe me not: and yet I
lie not. I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my
cousin.</p>
<p>BENEDICK By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Do not swear by it and eat it 862 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK I will swear by it that you love me, and I will make him eat
it that says I love not you.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Will you not eat your word?</p>
<p>BENEDICK With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest 863 I
love thee.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Why then, God forgive me.</p>
<p>BENEDICK What offence, sweet Beatrice?</p>
<p>BEATRICE You have stayed 864 me in a happy hour: I was about to
protest I loved you.</p>
<p>BENEDICK And do it with all thy heart.</p>
<p>BEATRICE I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to
protest.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Come, bid me do anything for thee.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Kill Claudio.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Ha, not for the wide world.</p>
<p>BEATRICE You kill me to deny. Farewell.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Tarry 865 , sweet Beatrice.</p>
<p>BEATRICE I am gone, though I am here. There is no love in you. Nay I
pray you let me go.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Beatrice—</p>
<p>BEATRICE In faith, I will go.</p>
<p>BENEDICK We’ll be friends first.</p>
<p>BEATRICE You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine
enemy.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Is Claudio thine enemy?</p>
<p>BEATRICE Is a not approved in the height a villain, that hath
slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O that I were a man! What,
bear her in hand 866 until they come to take hands 867 , and then, with
public accusation, uncovered 868 slander, unmitigated rancour — O God,
that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Hear me, Beatrice—</p>
<p>BEATRICE Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying! 869</p>
<p>BENEDICK Nay, but Beatrice—</p>
<p>BEATRICE Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone
870 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK Beat—</p>
<p>BEATRICE Princes and counties 871 ! Surely, a princely testimony 872
, a goodly Count 873 Comfit 874 , a sweet gallant, surely! O that I were
a man for his sake! Or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake!
But manhood is melted into curtsies, valour into compliment 875 , and
men are only turned into tongue 876 , and trim 877 ones too. He is now
as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it 878 . I
cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with
grieving.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand I love thee.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged
Hero?</p>
<p>BEATRICE Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Enough: I am engaged 879 , I will challenge him. I will kiss
your hand, and so leave you. By this hand, Claudio shall render me a
dear 880 account. As you hear of me, so think of me. Go comfort your
cousin, I must say she is dead: and so farewell.</p>
