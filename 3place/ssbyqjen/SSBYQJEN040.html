<p>Enter Valentine</p>
<p>VALENTINE How use doth breed a habit in a man!</p>
<p>This shadowy desert 1012 , unfrequented woods,</p>
<p>I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:</p>
<p>Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,</p>
<p>And to the nightingale’s complaining 1013 notes</p>
<p>Tune my distresses and record 1014 my woes.</p>
<p>O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,</p>
<p>Leave not the mansion 1015 so long tenantless,</p>
<p>Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall</p>
<p>And leave no memory of what it was.</p>
<p>Repair 1016 me with thy presence, Silvia:</p>
<p>Thou gentle nymph 1017 , cherish thy forlorn swain.</p>
<p>Commotion within</p>
<p>What hallowing 1018 and what stir is this today?</p>
<p>These are my mates, that make their wills their law,</p>
<p>Have 1019 some unhappy passenger in chase.</p>
<p>They love me well: yet I have much to do</p>
<p>To keep them from 1020 uncivil outrages.</p>
<p>Withdraw thee, Valentine: who’s this comes here?</p>
<p>Stands aside</p>
<p>[Enter Proteus, Silvia, and Julia disguised as Sebastian ]</p>
<p>PROTEUS Madam, this service I have done for you —</p>
<p>Though you respect 1021 not aught 1022 your servant doth —</p>
<p>To hazard life and rescue you from him 1023</p>
<p>That would have forced your honour and your love 1024 .</p>
<p>Vouchsafe 1025 me for my meed 1026 but one fair 1027 look:</p>
<p>A smaller boon 1028 than this I cannot beg,</p>
<p>And less than this I am sure you cannot give.</p>
<p>VALENTINE How like a dream is this? I see and hear:</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.</p>
<p>SILVIA O miserable, unhappy that I am!</p>
<p>PROTEUS Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came:</p>
<p>But by my coming I have made you happy.</p>
<p>SILVIA By thy approach 1029 thou mak’st me most unhappy.</p>
<p>JULIA And me, when he approacheth to your presence.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>SILVIA Had I been seizèd by a hungry lion,</p>
<p>I would have been a breakfast to the beast</p>
<p>Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.</p>
<p>O, heaven, be judge how I love Valentine,</p>
<p>Whose life’s as tender 1030 to me as my soul!</p>
<p>And full 1031 as much, for more there cannot be,</p>
<p>I do detest false perjured Proteus.</p>
<p>Therefore be gone, solicit 1032 me no more.</p>
<p>PROTEUS What dangerous action 1033 , stood it next to death,</p>
<p>Would I not undergo for one calm look:</p>
<p>O, ’tis the curse in love, and still approved 1034 ,</p>
<p>When women cannot love where they’re beloved.</p>
<p>SILVIA When Proteus cannot love where he’s beloved.</p>
<p>Read over Julia’s heart, thy first best love,</p>
<p>For whose dear sake thou didst then rend 1035 thy faith</p>
<p>Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths</p>
<p>Descended into perjury, to love me.</p>
<p>Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou’dst two 1036 ,</p>
<p>And that’s far worse than none: better have none</p>
<p>Than plural faith, which is too much by one.</p>
<p>Thou counterfeit to thy true friend 1037 !</p>
<p>PROTEUS In love</p>
<p>Who respects 1038 friend?</p>
<p>SILVIA All men but Proteus.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Nay, if the gentle spirit 1039 of moving 1040 words</p>
<p>Can no way change you to a milder form 1041 ,</p>
<p>I’ll woo you like a soldier, at arms’ end 1042 ,</p>
<p>And love you ’gainst the nature of love: force ye.</p>
<p>He grabs her</p>
<p>SILVIA O heaven!</p>
<p>PROTEUS I’ll force thee yield to my desire.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil 1043 touch,</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>Thou friend of an ill fashion 1044 !</p>
<p>PROTEUS Valentine!</p>
<p>VALENTINE Thou common 1045 friend, that’s without faith or love,</p>
<p>For such is a friend now. Treacherous man,</p>
<p>Thou hast beguiled 1046 my hopes; nought but mine eye</p>
<p>Could have persuaded me. Now I dare not say</p>
<p>I have one friend alive: thou wouldst disprove me.</p>
<p>Who should be trusted, when one’s right hand 1047</p>
<p>Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,</p>
<p>I am sorry I must never trust thee more,</p>
<p>But count 1048 the world a stranger for thy sake.</p>
<p>The private 1049 wound is deepest. O time most accurst,</p>
<p>’Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!</p>
<p>PROTEUS My shame and guilt confounds 1050 me.</p>
<p>Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow</p>
<p>Be a sufficient ransom for offence,</p>
<p>I tender’t 1051 here. I do as truly suffer</p>
<p>As e’er I did commit 1052 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE Then I am paid:</p>
<p>And once again I do receive thee 1053 honest.</p>
<p>Who 1054 by repentance is not satisfied</p>
<p>Is nor 1055 of heaven nor earth, for these 1056 are pleased:</p>
<p>By penitence 1057 th’Eternal’s 1058 wrath’s appeased.</p>
<p>And that my love 1059 may appear plain and free 1060 ,</p>
<p>All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.</p>
<p>JULIA O, me unhappy!</p>
<p>Swoons</p>
<p>PROTEUS Look to the boy.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Why, boy! Why, wag 1061 ! How now? What’s the matter? Look
up: speak.</p>
<p>JULIA O, good sir, my master charged 1062 me to deliver a ring to
Madam Silvia,</p>
<p>which, out of my neglect, was never done.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Where is that ring, boy?</p>
<p>JULIA Here ’tis: this is it.</p>
<p>Produces her own ring</p>
<p>PROTEUS How? Let me see. Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.</p>
<p>Takes ring</p>
<p>JULIA O, cry you mercy 1063 , sir, I have mistook:</p>
<p>This is the ring you sent to Silvia.</p>
<p>Offers another ring</p>
<p>PROTEUS But how cam’st thou by this ring? At my depart 1064 I gave
this unto Julia.</p>
<p>JULIA And Julia herself did give it me,</p>
<p>And Julia herself hath brought it hither.</p>
<p>Reveals herself</p>
<p>PROTEUS How? Julia?</p>
<p>JULIA Behold her that gave aim 1065 to all thy oaths,</p>
<p>And entertained 1066 ’em deeply in her heart.</p>
<p>How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root 1067 !</p>
<p>O Proteus, let this habit 1068 make thee blush.</p>
<p>Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me</p>
<p>Such an immodest raiment 1069 , if shame live</p>
<p>In a disguise of love 1070 !</p>
<p>It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,</p>
<p>Women to change their shapes than men their minds 1071 .</p>
<p>PROTEUS Than men their minds? ’Tis true. O heaven, were man</p>
<p>But constant, he were perfect. That one error</p>
<p>Fills him with faults, makes him run through all th’sins:</p>
<p>Inconstancy falls off ere it begins 1072 .</p>
<p>What is in Silvia’s face but I may spy</p>
<p>More fresh in Julia’s, with a constant eye?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Come, come, a hand from either.</p>
<p>Proteus and Julia join hands</p>
<p>Let me be blest to make this happy close:</p>
<p>’Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish forever.</p>
<p>JULIA And I mine.</p>
<p>[Enter Outlaws, with Duke and Turio ]</p>
<p>OUTLAWS A prize, a prize, a prize!</p>
<p>VALENTINE Forbear, forbear, I say! It is my lord the Duke.</p>
<p>Outlaws release Duke and Turio</p>
<p>Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced 1073 ,</p>
<p>Banished Valentine.</p>
<p>DUKE Sir Valentine?</p>
<p>TURIO Yonder is Silvia, and Silvia’s mine.</p>
<p>Steps forward</p>
<p>VALENTINE Turio, give 1074 back, or else embrace thy death:</p>
<p>Draws his sword</p>
<p>Come not within the measure 1075 of my wrath.</p>
<p>Do not name Silvia thine: if once again,</p>
<p>Verona shall not hold 1076 thee. Here she stands,</p>
<p>Take but possession of her with a touch:</p>
<p>I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.</p>
<p>TURIO Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I.</p>
<p>I hold him but a fool that will endanger</p>
<p>His body for a girl that loves him not:</p>
<p>I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.</p>
<p>DUKE The more degenerate and base art thou</p>
<p>To make such means 1077 for her as thou hast done,</p>
<p>And leave her on such slight conditions 1078 .</p>
<p>Now, by the honour of my ancestry,</p>
<p>I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,</p>
<p>And think thee worthy of an empress’ love:</p>
<p>Know then, I here forget all former griefs,</p>
<p>Cancel all grudge, repeal 1079 thee home again,</p>
<p>Plead a new state in thy unrivalled merit 1080 ,</p>
<p>To which I thus subscribe 1081 : Sir Valentine,</p>
<p>Thou art a gentleman and well derived,</p>
<p>Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.</p>
<p>VALENTINE I thank your grace: the gift hath made me happy.</p>
<p>I now beseech you, for your daughter’s sake,</p>
<p>To grant one boon that I shall ask of you.</p>
<p>DUKE I grant it, for thine own, whate’er it be.</p>
<p>VALENTINE These banished men that I have kept withal 1082</p>
<p>Are men endued with worthy qualities:</p>
<p>Forgive them what they have committed here</p>
<p>And let them be recalled from their exile:</p>
<p>They are reformèd, civil, full of good,</p>
<p>And fit for great employment 1083 , worthy lord.</p>
<p>DUKE Thou hast prevailed: I pardon them and thee.</p>
<p>Dispose of 1084 them as thou know’st their deserts 1085 .</p>
<p>Come, let us go: we will include all jars 1086</p>
<p>With triumphs 1087 , mirth and rare solemnity 1088 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE And as we walk along, I dare be bold</p>
<p>With our discourse to make your grace 1089 to smile.</p>
<p>What think you of this page, my lord?</p>
<p>DUKE I think the boy hath grace 1090 in him: he blushes.</p>
<p>VALENTINE I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.</p>
<p>DUKE What mean you by that saying?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Please you, I’ll tell you as we pass along,</p>
<p>That you will wonder what hath fortunèd 1091 .</p>
<p>Come Proteus, ’tis your penance but to hear</p>
<p>The story of your loves discoverèd.</p>
<p>That done, our day of marriage shall be yours,</p>
<p>One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster, and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count in the right margin at the beginning of each new scene, in
the typeface used for editorial directions. Where there is a scene break
caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change and
extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene continues
. There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in making such
calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the pace of the
plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom . . . Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semicolon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language).Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ‘bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading ‘bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
