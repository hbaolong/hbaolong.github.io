<h4 id="scene-3-running-scene-7-550">Scene 3 ／ running scene 7 550</h4>
<p>Enter Benvolio and Mercutio</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Where the devil should this Romeo be?</p>
<p>Came he not home tonight 551 ?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Not to his father’s: I spoke with his man 552 .</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,</p>
<p>Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,</p>
<p>Hath sent a letter to his father’s house.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO A challenge, on my life.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Romeo will answer it 553 .</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Any man that can write may answer a letter.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being
dared 554 .</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white
wench’s black eye 555 , run through the ear with a love-song, the very
pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy’s 556 butt-shaft 557 : and
is he a man to encounter Tybalt?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Why, what is Tybalt?</p>
<p>MERCUTIO More than prince of cats 558 , O, he’s the courageous
captain of compliments: he fights as you sing prick-song 559 , keeps
time, distance and proportion: he rests his minim rests 560 , one, two,
and the third 561 in your bosom — the very butcher of a silk button 562
— a duellist, a duellist, a gentleman of the very first house 563 , of
the first and second cause 564 . Ah, the immortal passado 565 , the
punto reverso 566 , the hay 567 !</p>
<p>BENVOLIO The what?</p>
<p>MERCUTIO The pox of 568 such antic, lisping, affecting 569
phantasimes 570 , these new tuners of accent 571 ! ‘Jesu, a very good
blade 572 , a very tall 573 man, a very good whore!’ Why, is not this a
lamentable thing, grandsire 574 , that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies 575 , these fashion-mongers, these ‘pardon-me’s’,
who stand 576 so much on the new form 577 , that they cannot sit at ease
on the old bench 578 ? O, their bones 579 , their bones!</p>
<p>Enter Romeo</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Without his roe 580 , like a dried herring 581 : O flesh 582
, flesh, how art thou fishified 583 ! Now is he for the numbers that
Petrarch flowed in 584 585 : Laura to 586 his lady was a kitchen-wench —
marry, she had a better love 587 to berhyme her — Dido a dowdy 588 ,
Cleopatra 589 a gypsy, Helen and Hero 590 hildings 591 and harlots,
Thisbe 592 a grey 593 eye or so, but not 594 to the purpose.— Signior
Romeo, bon jour: 595 there’s a French salutation to your French slop 596
. You gave us the counterfeit 597 fairly last night.</p>
<p>ROMEO Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?</p>
<p>MERCUTIO The slip, sir, the slip — can you not conceive 598 ?</p>
<p>ROMEO Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a
case 599 as mine a man may strain courtesy.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO That’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a
man to bow in the hams 600 .</p>
<p>ROMEO Meaning, to curtsy 601 .</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Thou hast most kindly hit it 602 .</p>
<p>ROMEO A most courteous exposition.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Nay, I am the very pink 603 of courtesy.</p>
<p>ROMEO Pink for flower.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Right.</p>
<p>ROMEO Why, then is my pump 604 well flowered 605 .</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Sure 606 wit, follow me 607 this jest now till thou hast
worn out thy pump, that when the single 608 sole of it is worn, the jest
may remain after the wearing sole singular 609 .</p>
<p>ROMEO O single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness 610
.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Come between us, good Benvolio, my wits faints.</p>
<p>ROMEO Switch and spurs 611 , switch 612 and spurs, or I’ll cry a
match 613 .</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase 614 , I am done,
for thou hast more of the wild-goose 615 in one of thy wits than I am
sure I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
616</p>
<p>ROMEO Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there
for the goose 617 .</p>
<p>MERCUTIO I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.</p>
<p>ROMEO Nay, good goose, bite not.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting 618 : it is a most sharp
sauce 619 .</p>
<p>ROMEO And is it not then well served into a sweet goose? 620</p>
<p>MERCUTIO O, here’s a wit 621 of cheverel 622 , that stretches from an
inch narrow to an ell 623 broad 624 !</p>
<p>ROMEO I stretch it out for that word ‘broad’, which added to the
goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art
thou sociable, now art thou Romeo, now art thou what thou art, by art as
well as by nature: for this drivelling 625 love is like a great natural
626 , that runs lolling 627 up and down to hide his bauble 628 in a hole
629 .</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Stop there 630 , stop there.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Thou desirest me to stop in 631 my tale 632 against the hair
633 .</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large 634 .</p>
<p>MERCUTIO O, thou art deceived: I would have made it short 635 , for I
was come to the whole depth 636 of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy
637 the argument 638 no longer.</p>
<p>Enter Nurse and her man [Peter ]</p>
<p>ROMEO Here’s goodly gear 639 . A sail 640 , a sail!</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Two, two: a shirt and a smock 641 .</p>
<p>NURSE Peter?</p>
<p>PETER Anon.</p>
<p>NURSE My fan, Peter.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Good Peter, to hide her face, for her fan’s the fairer
face.</p>
<p>NURSE God ye good morrow, gentlemen.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO God ye good e’en, fair gentlewoman.</p>
<p>NURSE Is it good e’en?</p>
<p>MERCUTIO ’Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand 642 of the dial
is now upon the prick 643 of noon.</p>
<p>NURSE Out upon you! 644 What 645 a man are you?</p>
<p>ROMEO One, gentlewoman, that God hath made himself to mar 646 .</p>
<p>NURSE By my troth 647 , it is well said: ‘for himself to mar’, quoth
a 648 ? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young
Romeo?</p>
<p>ROMEO I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older when you have
found him than he was when you sought him: I am the youngest of that
name, for fault 649 of a worse.</p>
<p>NURSE You say well.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Yea, is the worst well? Very well took 650 confidence 651 ,
i’faith, wisely, wisely.</p>
<p>NURSE If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO She will indite 652 him to some supper 653 .</p>
<p>MERCUTIO A bawd 654 , a bawd, a bawd! So ho! 655</p>
<p>ROMEO What hast thou found?</p>
<p>MERCUTIO No hare 656 , sir, unless a hare, sir, in a Lenten pie 657 ,
that is something stale 658 and hoar 659 meat 660 ere it be spent 661
.</p>
<p>An old hare hoar 662 ,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>And an old hare hoar,</p>
<p>Is very good meat in Lent.</p>
<p>But a hare that is hoar</p>
<p>Is too much for a score 663 ,</p>
<p>When it hoars 664 ere it be spent.</p>
<p>Romeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner, thither.</p>
<p>ROMEO I will follow you.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Farewell, ancient lady, farewell, ‘lady, lady, lady’.</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio</p>
<p>NURSE I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant 665 was this that was so
full of his ropery 666 ?</p>
<p>ROMEO A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will
speak more in a minute than he will stand to 667 in a month.</p>
<p>NURSE An a 668 speak anything against me, I’ll take him down 669 , an
a were lustier 670 than he is, and twenty such Jacks 671 , and if I
cannot, I’ll find those that shall. Scurvy knave, I am none of his
flirt-gills 672 , I am none of his skains-mates 673 .— And thou must
stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure 674 ?</p>
<p>To Peter</p>
<p>PETER I saw no man use you at his pleasure: if I had, my weapon 675
should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as soon as
another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my
side.</p>
<p>NURSE Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part 676 about me
quivers. Scurvy knave!— Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my
young lady bid me inquire you out: what she bid me say, I will keep to
myself. But first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s
paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they
say, for the gentlewoman is young, and therefore, if you should deal
double with 677 her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any
gentlewoman, and very weak 678 dealing.</p>
<p>To Romeo</p>
<p>ROMEO Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest 679 unto
thee—</p>
<p>NURSE Good heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord,
she will be a joyful woman.</p>
<p>ROMEO What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark 680 me.</p>
<p>NURSE I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it,
is a gentlemanlike offer.</p>
<p>ROMEO Bid her devise</p>
<p>Some means to come to shrift 681 this afternoon,</p>
<p>And there she shall at Friar Laurence’ cell</p>
<p>Be shrived 682 and married. Here is for thy pains.</p>
<p>Attempts to give money</p>
<p>NURSE No truly, sir, not a penny.</p>
<p>ROMEO Go to, I say you shall.</p>
<p>NURSE This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.</p>
<p>ROMEO And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:</p>
<p>Within this hour my man shall be with thee</p>
<p>And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair 683 ,</p>
<p>Which to the high top-gallant 684 of my joy</p>
<p>Must be my convoy in the secret night.</p>
<p>Farewell, be trusty and I’ll quit 685 thy pains.</p>
<p>Farewell, commend me to thy mistress.</p>
<p>NURSE Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.</p>
<p>ROMEO What say’st thou, my dear nurse?</p>
<p>NURSE Is your man secret 686 ? Did you ne’er hear say,</p>
<p>‘Two may keep counsel, putting one away’ 687 ?</p>
<p>ROMEO Warrant thee 688 , my man’s as true as steel.</p>
<p>NURSE Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady — Lord, Lord! When
’twas a little prating 689 thing — O, there is a nobleman in town, one
Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard 690 , but she, good soul, had as
lief 691 see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes and
tell her that Paris is the properer 692 man, but, I’ll warrant you, when
I say so, she looks as pale as any clout 693 in the versal 694 world.
Doth not rosemary 695 and Romeo begin both with a letter?</p>
<p>ROMEO Ay, nurse, what of that? Both with an R.</p>
<p>NURSE A mocker! That’s the dog’s name 696 : R is for the— 697 no, I
know it begins with some other letter — and she hath the prettiest
sententious 698 of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to
hear it.</p>
<p>ROMEO Commend me to thy lady.</p>
<p>[Exit Romeo ]</p>
<p>NURSE Ay, a thousand times.— Peter?</p>
<p>PETER Anon.</p>
<p>NURSE Before and apace 699 .</p>
<p>Exeunt Nurse and Peter</p>
