<p>Music plays. Enter a Servingman</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN Wine, wine, wine! What service is here? I think our
fellows 1403 are asleep.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>Enter another Servingman</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN Where’s Cotus? My master calls for him. Cotus!</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Coriolanus</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I</p>
<p>Appear not like a guest.</p>
<p>Enter the First Servingman</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN What would you have, friend? Whence 1404 are you?
Here’s no place for you: pray, go to the door 1405 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS I have deserved no better entertainment 1406 ,</p>
<p>In being Coriolanus.</p>
<p>Enter Second Servingman</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
head, that he gives entrance to such companions 1407 ? Pray, get you
out.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Away.</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN Away? Get you away.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Now thou’rt troublesome.</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN Are you so brave 1408 ? I’ll have you talked with
anon 1409 .</p>
<p>Enter Third Servingman: the first meets him</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN What fellow’s this?</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
out o’th’house: prithee, call my master to him.</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
1410 the house.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Let me but stand: I will not hurt your hearth.</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN What are you?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS A gentleman.</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN A marvellous poor one.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS True, so I am.</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other station
1411 : here’s no place for you: pray you, avoid: come.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Follow your function 1412 : go and batten 1413 on cold
bits 1414 .</p>
<p>Pushes him away from him</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
strange guest he has here.</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN And I shall.</p>
<p>Exit Second Servingman</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN Where dwell’st thou?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Under the canopy 1415 .</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN Under the canopy?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Ay.</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN Where’s that?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS I’th’city of kites and crows 1416 .</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN I’th’city of kites and crows? What an ass it is:
then thou dwell’st with daws 1417 too?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS No, I serve not thy master.</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN How, sir! Do you meddle 1418 with my master?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Ay, ’tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
mistress. Thou prat’st 1419 , and prat’st: serve with thy trencher 1420
, hence!</p>
<p>Beats him away</p>
<p>Enter Aufidius with the [Second ] Servingman</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS Where is this fellow?</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN Here, sir: I’d have beaten him like a dog, but 1421
for disturbing the lords within.</p>
<p>Servingmen stand aside</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS Whence com’st thou? What wouldst thou? Thy name?</p>
<p>Why speak’st not? Speak, man: what’s thy name?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS If, Tullus,</p>
<p>Unmuffling</p>
<p>Not yet thou know’st me, and seeing me dost not</p>
<p>Think me for the man I am, necessity</p>
<p>Commands me name myself.</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS What is thy name?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS A name unmusical to the Volscians’ ears,</p>
<p>And harsh in sound to thine.</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS Say, what’s thy name?</p>
<p>Thou hast a grim 1422 appearance, and thy face</p>
<p>Bears a command 1423 in’t: though thy tackle 1424 ’s torn,</p>
<p>Thou show’st 1425 a noble vessel: what’s thy name?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Prepare thy brow to frown: know’st thou me yet?</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS I know thee not: thy name?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS My name is Caius Martius, who hath done</p>
<p>To thee particularly 1426 , and to all the Volsces,</p>
<p>Great hurt and mischief 1427 : thereto witness may</p>
<p>My surname, Coriolanus 1428 . The painful 1429 service,</p>
<p>The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood</p>
<p>Shed for my thankless country, are requited</p>
<p>But with that surname: a good memory 1430</p>
<p>And witness of the malice and displeasure</p>
<p>Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains.</p>
<p>The cruelty and envy of the people,</p>
<p>Permitted by our dastard 1431 nobles, who</p>
<p>Have all forsook 1432 me, hath devoured the rest,</p>
<p>And suffered me by th’voice of slaves to be</p>
<p>Whooped 1433 out of Rome. Now this extremity</p>
<p>Hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope —</p>
<p>Mistake me not — to save my life: for if</p>
<p>I had feared death, of all the men i’th’world</p>
<p>I would have ’voided thee. But in mere 1434 spite</p>
<p>To be full quit of 1435 those my banishers,</p>
<p>Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast</p>
<p>A heart of wreak 1436 in thee, that wilt revenge</p>
<p>Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims</p>
<p>Of shame 1437 seen through 1438 thy country, speed thee straight,</p>
<p>And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it</p>
<p>That my revengeful services may prove</p>
<p>As benefits to thee, for I will fight</p>
<p>Against my cankered 1439 country with the spleen</p>
<p>Of all the under-fiends 1440 . But if so be</p>
<p>Thou dar’st not this, and that to prove more fortunes 1441</p>
<p>Thou’rt tired, then, in a word, I also am</p>
<p>Longer to live most weary, and present</p>
<p>My throat to thee and to thy ancient 1442 malice,</p>
<p>Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,</p>
<p>Since I have ever followed thee with hate,</p>
<p>Drawn tuns 1443 of blood out of thy country’s breast,</p>
<p>And cannot live but to thy shame, unless</p>
<p>It be to do thee service.</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS O Martius, Martius!</p>
<p>Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart</p>
<p>A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter</p>
<p>Should from yond cloud speak divine things,</p>
<p>And say ‘’Tis true’, I’d not believe them more</p>
<p>Than thee, all noble Martius. Let me twine</p>
<p>Mine arms about that body, where against 1444</p>
<p>My grainèd ash 1445 an hundred times hath broke,</p>
<p>And scarred the moon with splinters: here I clip 1446</p>
<p>He embraces Coriolanus</p>
<p>The anvil 1447 of my sword, and do contest</p>
<p>As hotly and as nobly with thy love</p>
<p>As ever in ambitious strength I did</p>
<p>Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,</p>
<p>I loved the maid I married: never man</p>
<p>Sighed truer breath. But that I see thee here,</p>
<p>Thou noble thing, more dances 1448 my rapt 1449 heart</p>
<p>Than when I first my wedded mistress saw</p>
<p>Bestride 1450 my threshold. Why, thou Mars 1451 , I tell thee,</p>
<p>We have a power on foot 1452 , and I had purpose</p>
<p>Once more to hew thy target 1453 from thy brawn 1454 ,</p>
<p>Or lose mine arm for’t: thou hast beat me out 1455</p>
<p>Twelve several 1456 times, and I have nightly since</p>
<p>Dreamt of encounters ’twixt thyself and me:</p>
<p>We have been down together 1457 in my sleep,</p>
<p>Unbuckling helms 1458 , fisting 1459 each other’s throat,</p>
<p>And waked 1460 half dead with nothing. Worthy Martius,</p>
<p>Had we no other quarrel else to Rome, but that</p>
<p>Thou art thence banished, we would muster all 1461</p>
<p>From twelve to seventy, and pouring war</p>
<p>Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,</p>
<p>Like a bold flood o’erbear’t 1462 . O, come, go in,</p>
<p>And take our friendly senators by th’hands</p>
<p>Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,</p>
<p>Who am prepared 1463 against your territories,</p>
<p>Though not for Rome itself.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS You bless me, gods.</p>
<p>AUFIDIUS Therefore, most absolute 1464 sir, if thou wilt have</p>
<p>The leading of thine own revenges, take</p>
<p>Th’one half of my commission 1465 , and set down 1466 —</p>
<p>As best thou art experienced, since thou know’st</p>
<p>Thy country’s strength and weakness — thine own ways:</p>
<p>Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,</p>
<p>Or rudely 1467 visit them in parts remote,</p>
<p>To fright them, ere destroy 1468 . But come in:</p>
<p>Let me commend 1469 thee first to those that shall</p>
<p>Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!</p>
<p>And more a friend than ere an enemy:</p>
<p>Yet, Martius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!</p>
<p>Exeunt [Coriolanus and Aufidius ]</p>
<p>The two Servingmen come forward</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN Here’s a strange alteration!</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
a cudgel, and yet my mind gave 1470 me his clothes made a false report
of him.</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN What an arm he has! He turned me about with his
finger and his thumb, as one would set up 1471 a top.</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
him. He had, sir, a kind of face, methought … I cannot tell how to term
it.</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN He had so, looking, as it were — would I were
hanged, but I thought there was more in him than I could think.</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN So did I, I’ll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
1472 man i’th’world.</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot
on 1473 .</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN Who, my master?</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN Nay, it’s no matter for 1474 that.</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN Worth six on 1475 him 1476 .</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
greater soldier.</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:
for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN Ay, and for an assault too.</p>
<p>Enter the Third Servingman</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN O slaves 1477 , I can tell you news: news, you
rascals!</p>
<p>FIRST and SECOND SERVINGMAN What, what, what? Let’s partake.</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN I would not be a Roman of all nations: I had as lief
1478 be a condemned man.</p>
<p>FIRST and SECOND SERVINGMAN Wherefore? 1479 Wherefore?</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN Why, here’s he that was wont 1480 to thwack our
general, Caius Martius.</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN Why do you say ‘thwack our general’?</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN I do not say ‘thwack our general’, but he was always
good enough for him.</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
hard for him: I have heard him say so himself.</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN He was too hard for him directly, to say the truth
on’t 1481 : before</p>
<p>Corioles he scotched 1482 him and notched him like a carbonado 1483
.</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN An 1484 he had been cannibally given 1485 , he
might have boiled and eaten him too.</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN But more of thy news!</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN Why, he is so made on 1486 here within, as if he
were son and heir to Mars: set at upper end o’th’table 1487 : no
question asked him by any of the senators, but they stand bald 1488
before him. Our general himself makes a mistress of him: sanctifies
himself with’s hand 1489 and turns up the white o’th’eye to his
discourse. But the bottom 1490 of the news is, our general is cut
i’th’middle and but one half of what he was yesterday: for the other has
half, by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He’ll go, he says,
and sowl 1491 the porter of Rome gates by th’ears. He will mow all down
before him, and leave his passage polled 1492 .</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN And he’s as like to do’t as any man I can
imagine.</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN Do’t? He will do’t: for look you, sir, he has as
many friends as enemies: which friends, sir, as it were, durst not, look
you, sir, show themselves, as we term it, his friends whilst he’s in
directitude 1493 .</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN Directitude? What’s that?</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN But when they shall see, sir, his crest 1494 up
again, and the man in blood 1495 , they will 1496 out of their burrows,
like conies 1497 after rain, and revel all with him.</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN But when goes this forward?</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN Tomorrow, today, presently 1498 : you shall have the
drum struck up this afternoon: ’tis as it were a parcel 1499 of their
feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN Why, then we shall have a stirring 1500 world
again. This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and
breed ballad-makers.</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN Let me have war, say I: it exceeds peace as far as
day does night: it’s sprightly walking, audible 1501 , and full of vent
1502 . Peace is a very apoplexy 1503 , lethargy, mulled 1504 , deaf,
sleepy, insensible: a getter 1505 of more bastard children than war’s a
destroyer of men.</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN ’Tis so: and as wars in some sort may be said to be
a ravisher 1506 , so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of
cuckolds 1507 .</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN Ay, and it makes men hate one another.</p>
<p>THIRD SERVINGMAN Reason: because they then less need one another. The
wars for my money: I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians. They are
rising 1508 , they are rising.</p>
<p>FIRST and SECOND SERVINGMAN In, in, in, in.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
