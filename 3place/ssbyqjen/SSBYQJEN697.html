<h4 id="scene-4-618-running-scene-7">Scene 4 618 / running scene 7</h4>
<p>Enter Prince and Poins</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Ned, prithee come out of that fat 619 room, and lend me
thy hand 620 to laugh a little.</p>
<p>POINS Where hast been, Hal?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY With three or four loggerheads 621 amongst three or
fourscore 622 hogsheads 623 . I have sounded the very base-string of
humility 624 . Sirrah, I am sworn brother 625 to a leash 626 of drawers
627 , and can call them by their names, as Tom, Dick and Francis 628 .
They take it already upon their confidence that though I be but Prince
of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy, telling me flatly I am no proud
629 Jack 630 like Falstaff, but a Corinthian 631 , a lad of mettle 632 ,
a good boy, and when I am king of England, I shall command all the good
lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet 633 ; and
when you breathe in your watering 634 , then they cry ‘Hem!’ 635 and bid
you play it 636 off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one
quarter of an hour that I can drink with any tinker in his own language
637 during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour that
thou wert not with me in this action 638 . But, sweet Ned — to sweeten
which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar 639 , clapped
even now into my hand by an under-skinker 640 , one that never spake
other English in his life than ‘Eight shillings and sixpence’ and ‘You
are welcome’, with this shrill addition, ‘Anon 641 , anon, sir!— Score
642 a pint of bastard 643 in the Half-Moon 644’, or so. But, Ned, to
drive 645 away time till Falstaff come, I prithee do thou stand in some
by-room 646 while I question my puny 647 drawer to what end 648 he gave
me the sugar and do never leave 649 calling ‘Francis’, that his tale to
me may be nothing but ‘Anon’. Step aside, and I’ll show thee a precedent
650 .</p>
<p>POINS Francis!</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Thou art perfect 651 .</p>
<p>POINS Francis!</p>
<p>[Exit Poins ]</p>
<p>Enter Drawer [Francis ]</p>
<p>FRANCIS Anon, anon, sir.— Look down into the Pomgarnet 652 ,
Ralph.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Come hither, Francis.</p>
<p>FRANCIS My lord?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY How long hast thou to serve 653 , Francis?</p>
<p>FRANCIS Forsooth, five years, and as much as to—</p>
<p>POINS Francis!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>FRANCIS Anon, anon, sir.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Five years. By’r lady 654 , a long lease for the
clinking of pewter 655 . But Francis, darest thou be so valiant as to
play the coward with thy indenture 656 and show it a fair pair of heels
and run from it?</p>
<p>FRANCIS O lord, sir, I’ll be sworn upon all the books 657 in England,
I could find in my heart—</p>
<p>POINS Francis!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>FRANCIS Anon, anon, sir.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY How old art thou, Francis?</p>
<p>FRANCIS Let me see — about Michaelmas 658 next I shall be—</p>
<p>POINS Francis!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>FRANCIS Anon, sir.— Pray you stay 659 a little, my lord.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Nay, but hark you, Francis, for 660 the sugar thou
gavest me, ’twas a pennyworth, was’t not?</p>
<p>FRANCIS O lord, sir, I would it had been two!</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I will give thee for it a thousand pound. Ask me when
thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.</p>
<p>POINS Francis!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>FRANCIS Anon, anon.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Anon, Francis? No, Francis. But tomorrow, Francis, or,
Francis, on Thursday, or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But,
Francis!</p>
<p>FRANCIS My lord?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Wilt thou rob 661 this leathern jerkin 662 ,
crystal-button 663 , not-pated 664 , agate-ring 665 , puke-stocking 666
, caddis-garter 667 , smooth-tongue 668 , Spanish-pouch 669 —</p>
<p>FRANCIS O lord, sir, who do you mean?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Why, then, your brown bastard 670 is your only drink 671
, for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet 672 will sully 673 .
In Barbary 674 , sir, it 675 cannot come to so much.</p>
<p>FRANCIS What, sir?</p>
<p>POINS Francis!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Away, you rogue! Dost thou hear them call?</p>
<p>Here they both call him. The Drawer stands amazed 676 , not knowing
which way to go Enter Vintner 677</p>
<p>VINTNER What, stand’st thou still, and hear’st such a calling? Look
to the guests within.</p>
<p>[Exit Francis ]</p>
<p>My lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are at the door: shall
I let them in?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.</p>
<p>[Exit Vintner ]</p>
<p>Poins!</p>
<p>Enter Poins</p>
<p>POINS Anon, anon, sir.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the
door. Shall we be merry?</p>
<p>POINS As merry as crickets 678 , my lad. But hark ye: what cunning
match 679 have you made with this jest of the drawer? Come, what’s the
issue 680 ?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I am now of all humours that have showed themselves
humours since the old days of goodman 681 Adam to the pupil age 682 of
this present twelve o’clock at midnight 683 .</p>
<p>[Enter Francis ]</p>
<p>What’s o’clock, Francis?</p>
<p>FRANCIS Anon 684 , anon, sir.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a
parrot, and yet 685 the son of a woman! His industry 686 is 687 upstairs
and downstairs, his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning 688 . I am not
yet of Percy’s mind 689 , the Hotspur of the north, he that kills me 690
some six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and
says to his wife ‘Fie upon this quiet life! I want work.’ ‘O my sweet
Harry’, says she, ‘how many hast thou killed today?’ ‘Give my roan horse
a drench 691’, says he, and answers ‘Some fourteen’, an hour after, ‘a
trifle, a trifle’. I prithee call in Falstaff. I’ll play Percy, and that
damned brawn 692 shall play Dame Mortimer his wife. ‘Rivo!’ 693 says the
drunkard. Call in ribs 694 , call in tallow 695 .</p>
<p>Poins calls</p>
<p>Enter Falstaff, [Gadshill, Bardolph and Peto. Francis follows with
wine ]</p>
<p>POINS Welcome, Jack. Where hast thou been?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF A plague of 696 all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too,
marry and amen!— Give me a cup of sack, boy.— Ere I lead this life long,
I’ll sew nether stocks 697 and mend them and foot 698 them too. A plague
of all cowards!— Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant
699 ?</p>
<p>To Francis</p>
<p>Drinks</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Didst thou never see Titan 700 kiss a dish of butter —
pitiful-hearted 701 Titan — that melted at the sweet tale of the sun? If
thou didst, then behold that compound 702 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF You rogue, here’s lime 703 in this sack too.— There is
nothing but roguery to be found in villainous man; yet a coward is worse
than a cup of sack with lime in’t.</p>
<p>To Francis</p>
<p>[Francis may exit ]</p>
<p>A villainous coward! Go thy ways 704 , old Jack, die when thou wilt,
if manhood, good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the earth, then
am I a shotten herring 705 . There lives not three good men unhanged in
England, and one of them is fat and grows old. God help the while 706 !
A bad world, I say. I would I were a weaver 707 . I could sing all
manner of songs. A plague of all cowards, I say still.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY How now, wool-sack 708 , what mutter you?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF A king’s son? If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with
a dagger of lath 709 , and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a
flock of wild geese, I’ll never wear hair 710 on my face more 711 . You
Prince of Wales?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Why, you whoreson round 712 man, what’s the matter?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Are you not a coward? Answer me to that. And Poins
there?</p>
<p>POINS Ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, I’ll stab thee.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I call thee coward? I’ll see thee damned ere I call thee
coward, but I would give a thousand pound I could run as fast as thou
canst. You are straight enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees
your back. Call you that backing 713 of your friends? A plague upon such
backing! Give me them that will face 714 me. Give me a cup of sack. I am
a rogue, if I drunk 715 today.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY O, villain, thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
drunk’st last.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF All’s one for that 716 .</p>
<p>He drinks</p>
<p>A plague of all cowards, still say I.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What’s the matter?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What’s the matter? Here be four of us have ta’en 717 a
thousand pound this morning.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Where is it, Jack? Where is it?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Where is it? Taken from us it is: a hundred upon poor 718
four of us.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What, a hundred, man?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword 719 with a dozen
of them two hours together. I have scaped by miracle. I am eight times
thrust through the doublet, four through the hose 720 , my buckler 721
cut through and through, my sword hacked like a hand-saw 722 — ecce
signum 723 ! I never dealt 724 better since I was a man: all would not
do 725 . A plague of all cowards! Let them speak; if they speak more or
less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness 726 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Speak, sirs, how was it?</p>
<p>GADSHILL We four set upon some dozen—</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Sixteen at least, my lord.</p>
<p>GADSHILL And bound them.</p>
<p>PETO No, no, they were not bound.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF You rogue, they were bound, every man of them, or I am a Jew
else, an Ebrew Jew 727 .</p>
<p>GADSHILL As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon
us—</p>
<p>FALSTAFF And unbound the rest, and then come in the other 728 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What, fought ye with them all?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF All? I know not what ye call all, but if I fought not with
fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if there were not two or three
and fifty upon poor old Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.</p>
<p>POINS Pray heaven you have not murdered some of them.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Nay, that’s past praying for, I have peppered 729 two of
them: two I am sure I have paid 730 , two rogues in buckram 731 suits. I
tell thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me
horse. Thou knowest my old ward 732 . Here I lay 733 and thus I bore my
point 734 . Four rogues in buckram let drive at 735 me—</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What, four? Thou saidst but two even now.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Four, Hal, I told thee four.</p>
<p>POINS Ay, ay, he said four.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF These four came all a-front 736 , and mainly 737 thrust at
me. I made no more ado 738 but took all their seven points 739 in my
target 740 , thus.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Seven? Why, there were but four even now.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF In buckram?</p>
<p>POINS Ay, four, in buckram suits.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Seven, by these hilts 741 , or I am a villain else.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Prithee let him alone. We shall have more anon.</p>
<p>Aside to Poins</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Dost thou hear me, Hal?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Ay, and mark 742 thee too, Jack.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine in
buckram that I told thee of—</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY So, two more already.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Their points 743 being broken—</p>
<p>POINS Down fell his hose.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Began to give me ground 744 . But I followed me close, came
in foot and hand 745 ; and with a thought 746 seven of the eleven I
paid.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY O, monstrous! Eleven buckram men grown out of two?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten 747
knaves in Kendal green 748 came at my back and let drive at me; for it
was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY These lies are like the father 749 that begets 750 them,
gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brained 751 guts,
thou knotty-pated 752 fool, thou whoreson, obscene, greasy tallow-catch
753 —</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What, art thou mad? Art thou mad? Is not the truth the
truth?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green
when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand? Come, tell us your
reason: what say’st thou to this?</p>
<p>POINS Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What, upon compulsion 754 ? No. Were I at the strappado 755
, or all the racks 756 in the world, I would not tell you on compulsion.
Give you a reason on compulsion? If reasons 757 were as plentiful as
blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion, I.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I’ll be no longer guilty of this sin. This sanguine 758
coward, this bed-presser 759 , this horseback-breaker 760 , this huge
hill of flesh—</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Away, you starveling, you elf-skin 761 , you dried neat’s
762 tongue, bull’s pizzle 763 , you stock-fish 764 ! O, for breath to
utter what is like thee! You tailor’s-yard 765 , you sheath 766 , you
bowcase 767 , you vile standing-tuck 768 —</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Well, breathe awhile, and then to’t again: and when thou
hast tired thyself in base comparisons, hear me speak but thus.</p>
<p>POINS Mark, Jack.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and were
masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down.
Then did we two set on you four, and with a word 769 , out-faced 770 you
from your prize, and have it, yea, and can show it you in the house.
And, Falstaff, you carried your guts away as nimbly, with as quick
dexterity, and roared for mercy and still ran and roared, as ever I
heard bull-calf. What a slave 771 art thou, to hack thy sword as thou
hast done, and then say it was in fight! What trick, what device, what
starting-hole 772 canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open
and apparent 773 shame?</p>
<p>POINS Come, let’s hear, Jack: what trick hast thou now?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I knew 774 ye as well as he that made ye. Why, hear ye, my
masters, was it for me to kill the heir-apparent? Should I turn upon the
true prince? Why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules 775 , but
beware instinct 776 . The lion will not touch the true prince 777 .
Instinct is a great matter. I was a coward on instinct. I shall think
the better of myself and thee during my life: I for a valiant lion, and
thou for a true prince. But, lads, I am glad you have the money.—
Hostess, clap to 778 the doors. Watch 779 tonight, pray tomorrow.
Gallants 780 , lads, boys, hearts 781 of gold, all the good titles of
fellowship come to you! What, shall we be merry? Shall we have a play
extempore 782 ?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Content, and the argument 783 shall be thy running
away.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Ah, no more of that, Hal, an 784 thou lovest me!</p>
<p>Enter Hostess [Quickly ]</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY My lord the prince?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY How now, my lady the hostess? What say’st thou to
me?</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at
door would speak with you: he says he comes from your father.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Give him as much as will make him a royal 785 man, and
send him back again to my mother.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What manner of man is he?</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY An old man.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What doth gravity 786 out of his bed at midnight? Shall I
give him his answer?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Prithee do, Jack.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF ’Faith, and I’ll send him packing.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Now, sirs: you fought fair; so did you, Peto, so did
you, Bardolph. You are lions too, you ran away upon instinct. You will
not touch the true prince; no, fie 787 !</p>
<p>BARDOLPH ’Faith, I ran when I saw others run.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff’s sword so
hacked?</p>
<p>PETO Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would swear truth
out of England 788 but he would make you believe it was done in fight,
and persuaded us to do the like.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass 789 to make
them bleed, and then to beslubber 790 our garments with it and swear it
was the blood of true 791 men. I did that 792 I did not this seven years
before, I blushed to hear his monstrous devices 793 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY O, villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years
ago, and wert taken with the manner 794 , and ever since thou hast
blushed extempore 795 . Thou hadst fire 796 and sword on thy side, and
yet thou ran’st away; what instinct hadst thou for it?</p>
<p>BARDOLPH My lord, do you see these meteors? Do you behold these
exhalations 797 ?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I do.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH What think you they portend 798 ?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Hot livers and cold purses 799 .</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Choler 800 , my lord, if rightly taken 801 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY No, if rightly taken, halter 802 .</p>
<p>Enter Falstaff</p>
<p>Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.— How now, my sweet
creature of bombast 803 ? How long is’t ago, Jack, since thou saw’st
thine own knee?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My own knee? When I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an
eagle’s talon in 804 the waist. I could have crept into any alderman’s
thumb-ring 805 . A plague of sighing and grief! It blows a man up like a
bladder. There’s villainous news abroad: here was Sir John Braby from
your father; you must go to the court in the morning. That same mad
fellow of the north, Percy 806 , and he of Wales 807 that gave Amamon
808 the bastinado 809 and made Lucifer 810 cuckold 811 and swore the
devil his true liegeman 812 upon the cross of a Welsh hook 813 — what a
plague 814 call you him?</p>
<p>POINS O, Glendower.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Owen, Owen the same, and his son-in-law Mortimer, and old
Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of Scots, Douglas, that runs
o’horseback up a hill perpendicular—</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY He that rides at high speed and with a pistol kills a
sparrow flying.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF You have hit it 815 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY So did he never the sparrow.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well, that rascal hath good mettle 816 in him. He will not
run 817 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so for
running 818 ?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF A-horseback, ye cuckoo 819 , but afoot he will not budge a
foot.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Yes, Jack, upon instinct.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too, and one
Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps 820 more. Worcester is stolen away by
night. Thy father’s beard is turned white with the news; you may buy
land now as cheap as stinking mackerel 821 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Then ’tis like 822 , if there come a hot 823 sun and
this civil buffeting hold 824 , we shall buy maidenheads 825 as they buy
hob-nails, by the hundreds 826 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF By the mass, lad, thou say’st true. It is like we shall have
good trading 827 that way. But tell me, Hal, art not thou horrible
afeard? Thou being heir apparent, could the world pick thee out three
such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that spirit 828 Percy, and
that devil Glendower? Art not thou horrible afraid? Doth not thy blood
thrill 829 at it?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Not a whit, I lack some of thy instinct.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well, thou wilt be horrible chid 830 tomorrow when thou
comest to thy father: if thou do love me, practise an answer.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Do thou stand for 831 my father, and examine me upon the
particulars 832 of my life.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Shall I? Content 833 . This chair shall be my state 834 ,
this dagger my sceptre and this cushion my crown.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Thy state is taken for a joint-stool 835 , thy golden
sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich crown 836 for a
pitiful bald crown.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well, an the fire of grace 837 be not quite out of thee, now
shalt thou be moved 838 . Give me a cup of sack to make mine eyes look
red, that it may be thought I have wept, for I must speak in passion,
and I will do it in King Cambyses’ vein 839 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Well, here is my leg.</p>
<p>He bows or kneels</p>
<p>FALSTAFF And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility 840 .</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY This is excellent sport, i’faith!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Weep not, sweet queen, for trickling tears are vain 841
.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY O, the father 842 , how he holds his countenance 843
!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF For God’s sake, lords, convey 844 my tristful 845 queen,</p>
<p>For tears do stop 846 the flood-gates of her eyes.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY O, rare 847 , he doth it as like one of these
harlotry players 848 as ever I see!</p>
<p>↓ Quickly may exit, perhaps escorted by Bardolph ↓</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Peace, good pint-pot 849 , peace, good tickle-brain 850 .—
Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how
thou art accompanied, for though the camomile 851 , the more it is
trodden the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the sooner
it wears. Thou art my son, I have partly thy mother’s word, partly my
opinion, but chiefly a villainous trick 852 of thine eye and a foolish
853 hanging of thy nether lip 854 that doth warrant 855 me. If then thou
be son to me, here lieth the point: why, being son to me, art thou so
pointed at 856 ? Shall the blessed sun 857 of heaven prove a micher 858
and eat blackberries? A question not to be asked. Shall the son of
England prove a thief and take purses? A question to be asked. There is
a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of and it is known to many
in our land by the name of pitch 859 : this pitch, as ancient writers do
report, doth defile 860 ; so doth the company thou keepest. For, Harry,
now I do not speak to thee in drink but in tears: not in pleasure but in
passion 861 : not in words only, but in woes also. And yet there is a
virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his
name.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What manner of man, an it like 862 your majesty?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF A goodly portly 863 man, i’faith, and a corpulent 864 : of a
cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage 865 , and as I
think, his age some fifty, or, by’r lady, inclining to threescore 866 ;
and now I remember me, his name is Falstaff. If that man should be
lewdly given 867 , he deceives me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his
looks. If then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the
tree, then peremptorily 868 I speak it, there is virtue in that
Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell me now, thou naughty
869 varlet, tell me, where hast thou been this month?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and
I’ll play my father.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Depose me? If thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically,
both in word and matter, hang me up by the heels for a rabbit-sucker 870
or a poulter’s hare 871 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Well, here I am set 872 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF And here I stand. Judge, my masters 873 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Now, Harry, whence come you?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My noble lord, from Eastcheap.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I’faith, my lord, they are false. — Nay, I’ll tickle ye 874
for a young prince.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Swearest thou, ungracious 875 boy? Henceforth ne’er look
on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace: there is a devil
haunts thee in the likeness of a fat old man; a tun 876 of man is thy
companion. Why dost thou converse 877 with that trunk 878 of humours 879
, that bolting-hutch 880 of beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies
881 , that huge bombard 882 of sack, that stuffed cloak-bag 883 of guts,
that roasted Manningtree 884 ox with the pudding 885 in his belly, that
reverend 886 Vice 887 , that grey 888 Iniquity 889 , that father 890
Ruffian, that Vanity 891 i 892 n years? Wherein is he good 893 , but to
taste sack and drink it? Wherein neat and cleanly 894 , but to carve a
capon and eat it? Wherein cunning 895 , but in craft 896 ? Wherein
crafty 897 , but in villainy? Wherein villainous, but in all things?
Wherein worthy, but in nothing?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I would your grace would take me with you 898 : whom means
your grace?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY That villainous abominable misleader of youth, Falstaff,
that old white-bearded Satan.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My lord, the man I know 899 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I know thou dost.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF But to say I know more harm in him than in myself, were to
say more than I know. That he is old, the more the pity, his white hairs
do witness it. But that he is, saving your reverence 900 , a whoremaster
901 , that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault, heaven help the
wicked: if to be old and merry be a sin, then many an old host 902 that
I know is damned: if to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh’s lean kine
903 are to be loved. No, my good lord, banish Peto, banish Bardolph,
banish Poins, but for sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack
Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant, being, as
he is old Jack Falstaff, banish not him thy Harry’s company, banish not
him thy Harry’s company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the
world.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I do, I will.</p>
<p>Knocking</p>
<p>Enter Bardolph, running</p>
<p>BARDOLPH O, my lord, my lord! The sheriff with a most monstrous 904
watch 905 is at the door.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Out, you rogue!— Play out the play: I have much to say in
the behalf of that Falstaff.</p>
<p>Enter the Hostess [Quickly ]</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY O, my lord, my lord!</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Heigh, heigh! The devil rides upon a fiddlestick 906 .
What’s the matter?</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they
are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Dost thou hear, Hal? Never call a true piece of gold a
counterfeit 907 : thou art essentially made, without seeming so 908
.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY And thou a natural coward, without instinct.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I deny your major 909 . If you will deny 910 the sheriff, so
911 : if not, let him enter: if I become 912 not a cart 913 as well as
another man, a plague on my bringing up 914 ! I hope I shall as soon 915
be strangled with a halter as another.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Go, hide thee behind the arras 916 . The rest walk up
above 917 . Now, my masters, for a true 918 face and good
conscience.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Both which I have had: but their date is out 919 , and
therefore I’ll hide me.</p>
<p>Falstaff hides behind the arras</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Call in the sheriff.</p>
<p>Exeunt [all except Prince Henry and Peto ]</p>
<p>Enter Sheriff and the Carrier</p>
<p>Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?</p>
<p>SHERIFF First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry 920</p>
<p>Hath followed certain men unto this house.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What men?</p>
<p>SHERIFF One of them is well known, my gracious lord,</p>
<p>A gross fat man.</p>
<p>CARRIER As fat as butter.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY The man, I do assure you, is not here,</p>
<p>For I myself at this time have employed him.</p>
<p>And, sheriff, I will engage 921 my word to thee</p>
<p>That I will, by tomorrow dinnertime 922 ,</p>
<p>Send him to answer thee 923 , or any man,</p>
<p>For anything he shall be charged withal 924 :</p>
<p>And so let me entreat you leave the house.</p>
<p>SHERIFF I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen</p>
<p>Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY It may be so: if he have robbed these men,</p>
<p>He shall be answerable 925 , and so farewell.</p>
<p>SHERIFF Goodnight, my noble lord.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I think it is good morrow 926 , is it not?</p>
<p>SHERIFF Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o’clock.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Sheriff and Carrier ]</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY This oily 927 rascal is known as well as Paul’s 928 .
Go, call him forth.</p>
<p>To Peto</p>
<p>PETO Falstaff! Fast asleep behind the arras, and snorting like a
horse.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his
pockets.</p>
<p>He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers</p>
<p>What hast thou found?</p>
<p>PETO Nothing but papers, my lord.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Let’s see, what be they? Read them.</p>
<p>PETO ’Item , A capon, 2s 2d 929 . Item , Sauce, 4d. Item , Sack, two
gallons, 5s 8d. Item ,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s 6d. Item , Bread, ob. 930 ’</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY O, monstrous! But 931 one halfpenny-worth of bread to
this intolerable deal 932 of sack? What there is else, keep close 933 ,
we’ll read it at more advantage 934 . There let him sleep till day. I’ll
to the court in the morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place
shall be honourable. I’ll procure this fat rogue a charge of foot 935 ,
and I know his death will be a march of twelvescore 936 . The money 937
shall be paid back again with advantage 938 . Be with me betimes 939 in
the morning, and so, good morrow, Peto.</p>
<p>PETO Good morrow, good my lord.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
