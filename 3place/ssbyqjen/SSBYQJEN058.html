<h4 id="scene-5-running-scene-12">Scene 5 ／ running scene 12</h4>
<p>Enter Falstaff</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Bardolph, I say!</p>
<p>[Enter Bardolph ]</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Here, sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Go fetch me a quart 795 of sack: put a toast 796 in’t.</p>
<p>[Exit Bardolph ]</p>
<p>Have I lived to be carried in a basket like a barrow 797 of butcher’s
offal, and to be thrown in the Thames? Well, if I be served such another
trick, I’ll have my brains ta’en out and buttered, and give them to a
dog for a new-year’s gift. The rogues slighted me 798 into the river
with as little remorse as they would have drowned a blind bitch’s
puppies 799 , fifteen i’th’litter. And you may know by my size that I
have a kind of alacrity in sinking: if the bottom were as deep as hell,
I should down 800 . I had been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy
801 and shallow — a death that I abhor, for the water swells a man — and
what a thing should I have been when I had been swelled? I should have
been a mountain of mummy 802 .</p>
<p>[Enter Bardolph with sack ]</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Here’s Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Come. let me pour in some sack to the Thames water, for my
belly’s as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for pills to cool the
reins 803 . Call her in.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Come in, woman.</p>
<p>[Enter Mistress Quickly ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY By your leave, I cry you mercy 804 ! Give your
worship good morrow.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Take away these chalices. Go, brew me a pottle 805 of sack
finely.</p>
<p>To Bardolph</p>
<p>BARDOLPH With eggs, sir?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Simple 806 of itself. I’ll 807 no pullet-sperm 808 in my
brewage.—</p>
<p>How now?</p>
<p>[Exit Bardolph ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress
Ford.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Mistress Ford? I have had ford 809 enough. I was thrown into
the ford, I have my belly full of ford.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Alas the day, good heart, that was not her fault.
She does so take on with 810 her men: they mistook their erection 811
.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman’s promise.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn
812 your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning a-birding. She
desires you once more to come to her between eight and nine. I must
carry her word quickly. She’ll make you amends, I warrant you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well, I will visit her. Tell her so, and bid her think what
a man is. Let her consider his frailty 813 , and then judge of my
merit.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY I will tell her.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Do so. Between nine and ten, say’st thou?</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Eight and nine, sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well, be gone. I will not miss 814 her.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Peace be with you, sir.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I marvel I hear not of Master Broom. He sent me word to stay
within. I well. O, here he comes.</p>
<p>[Enter Ford, disguised as Broom ]</p>
<p>FORD Bless you, sir!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Now, Master Broom, you come to know what hath passed between
me and Ford’s wife.</p>
<p>FORD That indeed, Sir John, is my business.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Master Broom, I will not lie to you: I was at her house the
hour she appointed me.</p>
<p>FORD And sped you 815 , sir?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Very ill-favouredly 816 , Master Broom.</p>
<p>FORD How so, sir? Did she change her determination 817 ?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF No, Master Broom, but the peaking cornuto 818 her husband,
Master Broom, dwelling in a continual ’larum 819 of jealousy, comes me
820 in the instant of our encounter, after we had embraced, kissed,
protested 821 , and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy: and
at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither provoked and instigated
by his distemper, and, forsooth, to search his house for his wife’s
love.</p>
<p>FORD What, while you were there?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF While I was there.</p>
<p>FORD And did he search for you, and could not find you?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes in one
Mistress Page, gives intelligence of Ford’s approach: and, in her
invention and Ford’s wife’s distraction, they conveyed me into a
buck-basket.</p>
<p>FORD A buck-basket?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Yes, a buck-basket! Rammed 822 me in with foul shirts and
smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy napkins, that 823 , Master Broom,
there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended
nostril.</p>
<p>FORD And how long lay you there?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Nay, you shall hear, Master Broom, what I have suffered to
bring this woman to evil for your good. Being thus crammed in the
basket, a couple of Ford’s knaves, his hinds 824 , were called forth by
their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet Lane:
they took me on their shoulders, met the jealous knave their master in
the door, who asked them once or twice what they had in their basket. I
quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave would have searched it, but
fate, ordaining he should be a cuckold, held 825 his hand. Well, on went
he for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But mark 826 the
sequel, Master Broom. I suffered the pangs of three several 827 deaths:
first, an intolerable fright, to be detected with 828 a jealous rotten
829 bell-wether 830 : next, to be compassed 831 , like a good bilbo 832
in the circumference of a peck 833 , hilt to point, heel to head, and
then, to be stopped 834 in like a strong distillation 835 with stinking
clothes that fretted 836 in their own grease. Think of that, a man of my
kidney 837 , think of that — that am as subject to heat as butter — a
man of continual dissolution 838 and thaw: it was a miracle to scape
suffocation. And in the height of this bath, when I was more than half
stewed in grease like a Dutch dish 839 , to be thrown into the Thames,
and cooled, glowing hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe. Think of that
— hissing hot — think of that, Master Broom.</p>
<p>FORD In good sadness 840 , sir, I am sorry that for my sake you have
suffered all this. My suit then is desperate. You’ll undertake her no
more?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Master Broom, I will be thrown into Etna 841 , as I have
been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her husband is this morning
gone a-birding. I have received from her another embassy 842 of meeting:
’twixt eight and nine is the hour, Master Broom.</p>
<p>FORD ’Tis past eight already, sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Is it? I will then address me to my appointment. Come to me
at your convenient leisure, and you shall know how I speed. And the
conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall
have her, Master Broom. Master Broom, you shall cuckold Ford.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>FORD Hum! Ha! Is this a vision? Is this a dream? Do I sleep? Master
Ford awake, awake, Master Ford! There’s a hole made in your best coat
843 , Master Ford. This ’tis to be married, this ’tis to have linen and
buck-baskets. Well, I will proclaim myself what I am. I will now take
the lecher.He is atmy house.He cannot scape me, ’tis impossible he
should. He cannot creep into a halfpenny purse 844 , nor into a
pepper-box. But, lest the devil that guides him should aid him, I will
search impossible places. Though what I am 845 I cannot avoid, yet to be
what I would not shall not make me tame. If I have horns to make one mad
846 , let the proverb go with me: I’ll be horn-mad.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
