15</h4>
<p>Enter, at one door King Henry, Exeter, Bedford, Warwick, [Gloucester,
Clarence, Westmorland] and other Lords: at another, Queen Isabel, the
[French ] King, the Duke of Burgundy and other French [including
Katherine and Alice ]</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Peace to this meeting, wherefore 1832 we are met.</p>
<p>Unto our brother 1833 France, and to our sister 1834 ,</p>
<p>Health and fair time of day 1835 , joy and good wishes</p>
<p>To our most fair and princely 1836 cousin Katherine,</p>
<p>And, as a branch and member of this royalty 1837 ,</p>
<p>By whom this great assembly is contrived,</p>
<p>We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy,</p>
<p>And princes French and peers, health to you all!</p>
<p>FRENCH KING Right joyous are we to behold your face,</p>
<p>Most worthy brother England, fairly met.</p>
<p>So are you, princes English, every one.</p>
<p>QUEEN ISABEL So happy be the issue 1838 , brother England,</p>
<p>Of this good day and of this gracious 1839 meeting,</p>
<p>As we are now glad to behold your eyes ——</p>
<p>Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them</p>
<p>Against the French, that met them in their bent 1840 ,</p>
<p>The fatal balls 1841 of murdering basilisks 1842 .</p>
<p>The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,</p>
<p>Have lost their quality 1843 , and that this day</p>
<p>Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V To cry amen to that, thus we appear.</p>
<p>QUEEN ISABEL You English princes all, I do salute you.</p>
<p>BURGUNDY My duty to you both, on 1844 equal love,</p>
<p>Great Kings of France and England! That I have laboured,</p>
<p>With all my wits, my pains 1845 and strong endeavours,</p>
<p>To bring your most imperial majesties</p>
<p>Unto this bar 1846 and royal interview 1847 ,</p>
<p>Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.</p>
<p>Since then my office hath so far prevailed</p>
<p>That 1848 , face to face and royal eye to eye,</p>
<p>You have congreeted 1849 , let it not disgrace me,</p>
<p>If I demand, before this royal view 1850 ,</p>
<p>What rub 1851 or what impediment there is,</p>
<p>Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,</p>
<p>Dear nurse 1852 of arts 1853 , plenties and joyful births,</p>
<p>Should not in this best garden of the world,</p>
<p>Our fertile France, put up 1854 her lovely visage 1855 ?</p>
<p>Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,</p>
<p>And all her husbandry 1856 doth lie on heaps 1857 ,</p>
<p>Corrupting in it 1858 own fertility 1859 .</p>
<p>Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,</p>
<p>Unprunèd dies: her hedges even-pleached 1860 ,</p>
<p>Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,</p>
<p>Put forth disordered twigs: her fallow leas 1861</p>
<p>The darnel, hemlock and rank 1862 fumitory 1863</p>
<p>Doth root upon 1864 , while that the coulter 1865 rusts</p>
<p>That should deracinate 1866 such savagery 1867 .</p>
<p>The even mead 1868 , that erst 1869 brought sweetly forth</p>
<p>The freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover 1870 ,</p>
<p>Wanting 1871 the scythe, withal uncorrected 1872 , rank,</p>
<p>Conceives 1873 by idleness and nothing teems 1874</p>
<p>But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies 1875 , burs 1876 ,</p>
<p>Losing both beauty and utility;</p>
<p>And all our vineyards, fallows 1877 , meads and hedges,</p>
<p>Defective in their natures 1878 , grow to wildness.</p>
<p>Even so our houses and ourselves and children</p>
<p>Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,</p>
<p>The sciences 1879 that should become our country,</p>
<p>But grow like savages —— as soldiers will</p>
<p>That nothing do but meditate on blood ——</p>
<p>To swearing and stern looks, diffused 1880 attire</p>
<p>And everything that seems unnatural.</p>
<p>Which to reduce 1881 into our former favour 1882</p>
<p>You are assembled, and my speech entreats</p>
<p>That I may know the let 1883 , why gentle Peace</p>
<p>Should not expel these inconveniences</p>
<p>And bless us with her former qualities.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V If, Duke of Burgundy, you would 1884 the peace,</p>
<p>Whose want 1885 gives growth to th’imperfections</p>
<p>Which you have cited, you must buy that peace</p>
<p>With full accord 1886 to all our just 1887 demands,</p>
<p>Whose tenors 1888 and particular effects 1889</p>
<p>You have enscheduled 1890 briefly in your hands.</p>
<p>BURGUNDY The king hath heard them, to the which as yet</p>
<p>There is no answer made.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Well then, the peace,</p>
<p>Which you before so urged, lies in his answer.</p>
<p>FRENCH KING I have but with a cursitory eye 1891</p>
<p>O’erglanced 1892 the articles. Pleaseth 1893 your grace</p>
<p>To appoint some of your council presently</p>
<p>To sit with us once more, with better heed 1894</p>
<p>To re-survey them, we will suddenly 1895</p>
<p>Pass 1896 our accept 1897 and peremptory 1898 answer.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Brother, we shall.—— Go, uncle Exeter,</p>
<p>And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,</p>
<p>Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king,</p>
<p>And take with you free power to ratify 1899 ,</p>
<p>Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best</p>
<p>Shall see advantageable for our dignity,</p>
<p>Anything in or out of our demands,</p>
<p>And we’ll consign 1900 thereto.—— Will you, fair sister,</p>
<p>To Queen Isabel</p>
<p>Go with the princes, or stay here with us?</p>
<p>QUEEN ISABEL Our gracious brother, I will go with them:</p>
<p>Haply 1901 a woman’s voice may do some good,</p>
<p>When articles too nicely 1902 urged be stood on 1903 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us.</p>
<p>She is our capital 1904 demand comprised 1905</p>
<p>Within the fore-rank 1906 of our articles 1907 .</p>
<p>QUEEN ISABEL She hath good leave.</p>
<p>Exeunt all. Henry, Katherine [and Alice ] remain</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Fair Katherine, and most fair,</p>
<p>Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms 1908</p>
<p>Such as will enter at a lady’s ear</p>
<p>And plead his love-suit 1909 to her gentle heart?</p>
<p>KATHERINE Your majesty shall mock at me: I cannot speak your
England.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V O fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly with your
French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your
English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?</p>
<p>KATHERINE Pardonnez-moi 1910 , I cannot tell vat is ‘like me’.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an
angel.</p>
<p>KATHERINE Que dit-il ? Que je su. is semblable à les anges ? 1911</p>
<p>To Alice</p>
<p>ALICE Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grâce, ainsi dit-il 1912 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V I said so, dear Katherine, and I must not blush to
affirm it.</p>
<p>KATHERINE O bon Dieu ! Les langues des hommes sont pleines de
tromperies 1913 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V What says she, fair one? That the tongues of men are
full of deceits?</p>
<p>To Alice</p>
<p>ALICE Oui , dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits: dat is
de princess 1914 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V The princess is the better Englishwoman 1915 . I’faith,
Kate, my wooing is fit 1916 for thy understanding. I am glad thou canst
speak no better English, for, if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such
a plain 1917 king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my
crown. I know no ways to mince 1918 it in love, but directly to say ‘I
love you.’ Then if you urge me further than to say, ‘Do you in faith?’,
I wear out my suit 1919 . Give me your answer, i’faith, do, and so clap
hands and a bargain 1920 . How say you, lady?</p>
<p>KATHERINE Sauf votre honneur 1921 , me understand vell.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Marry, if you would put me to verses 1922 or to dance
for your sake, Kate, why you undid 1923 me, for the one I have neither
words nor measure 1924 ; and for the other, I have no strength in
measure 1925 , yet a reasonable measure 1926 in strength 1927 . If I
could win a lady at leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my
armour on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken 1928 ,
I should quickly leap into 1929 a wife. Or if I might buffet 1930 for my
love, or bound 1931 my horse for her favours, I could lay on 1932 like a
butcher and sit 1933 like a jackanapes 1934 , never off 1935 . But,
before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly 1936 nor gasp out my eloquence,
nor I have no cunning in protestation 1937 ; only downright 1938 oaths,
which I never use till urged 1939 , nor never break for urging 1940 . If
thou canst love a fellow of this temper 1941 , Kate, whose face is not
worth sunburning 1942 , that never looks in his glass 1943 for love of
anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook 1944 . I speak to thee
plain soldier: if thou canst love me for this, take me: if not, to say
to thee that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the lord, no.
Yet I love thee too. And while thou liv’st, dear Kate, take a fellow of
plain and uncoined 1945 constancy, for he perforce must do thee right,
because he hath not the gift to woo in other places. For these fellows
of infinite tongue 1946 , that can rhyme themselves into ladies’ favours
1947 , they do always reason themselves out again. What! 1948 A speaker
is but a prater 1949 , a rhyme is but a ballad 1950 . A good leg will
fall 1951 , a straight back will stoop, a black beard will turn white, a
curled pate will grow bald, a fair face will wither, a full 1952 eye
will wax hollow 1953 : but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon
—— or rather the sun and not the moon, for it shines bright and never
changes, but keeps his course truly. If thou would have such a one, take
me: and take me, take a soldier: take a soldier, take a king. And what
say’st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and fairly 1954 , I pray
thee.</p>
<p>KATHERINE Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of
France, Kate; but in loving me, you should love the friend 1955 of
France, for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of
it; I will have it all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am
yours, then yours is France and you are mine.</p>
<p>KATHERINE I cannot tell vat is dat.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am sure
will hang upon my tongue like a new-married wife about her husband’s
neck, hardly to be shook off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et
quand vous avez le possession de moi 1956 —— let me see, what then?
Saint Denis 1957 be my speed! 1958 —— donc vôtre est France et vous êtes
mienne 1959 . It is as easy for me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to
speak so much more French. I shall never move 1960 thee in French,
unless it be to laugh at me.</p>
<p>KATHERINE Sauf votre honneur, le français que vous parle 1961 z, il
est meilleur que l’anglais lequel je parle .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V No, faith, is’t not, Kate. But thy speaking of my
tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely 1962 , must needs be granted to
be much at one 1963 . But, Kate, dost thou understand thus much English,
canst thou love me?</p>
<p>KATHERINE I cannot tell.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Can any of your neighbours 1964 tell, Kate? I’ll ask
them. Come, I know thou lovest me. And at night, when you come into your
closet 1965 , you’ll question this gentlewoman about me; and I know,
Kate, you will to her dispraise 1966 those parts in me that you love
with your heart, but, good Kate, mock me mercifully, the rather, gentle
princess, because I love thee cruelly 1967 . If ever thou beest 1968
mine, Kate, as I have a saving faith 1969 within me tells me thou shalt,
I get thee with scambling 1970 , and thou must therefore needs prove a
good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou and I, between Saint Denis and
Saint George, compound 1971 a boy, half French, half English, that shall
go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard 1972 ? Shall we not?
What say’st thou, my fair flower-de-luce 1973 ?</p>
<p>KATHERINE I do not know dat.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V No, ’tis hereafter 1974 to know 1975 , but now to
promise: do but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your French
part 1976 of such a boy; and for my English moiety 1977 take the word of
a king and a bachelor. How answer you, la plus belle</p>
<p>Katherine du monde, mon très chère et devin déesse 1978 ?</p>
<p>KATHERINE Your majestee ’ave 1979 fausse 1980 French enough to
deceive de most sage 1981 demoiselle 1982 dat is en France .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in true
English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I dare not swear thou lovest
me, yet my blood 1983 begins to flatter me that thou dost,
notwithstanding 1984 the poor and untempering 1985 effect of my visage.
Now, beshrew 1986 my father’s ambition! He was thinking of civil wars
1987 when he got 1988 me: therefore was I created with a stubborn
outside, with an aspect 1989 of iron, that when I come to woo ladies, I
fright them. But, in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall
appear. My comfort is that old age, that ill layer-up 1990 of beauty,
can do no more spoil 1991 upon my face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me,
at the worst; and thou shalt wear 1992 me, if thou wear me, better and
better. And therefore tell me, most fair Katherine, will you have me?
Put off your maiden blushes, avouch the thoughts of your heart with the
looks of an empress, take me by the hand, and say, ‘Harry of England I
am thine.’ Which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I
will tell thee aloud, ‘England is thine, Ireland is thine, France is
thine, and Henry Plantagenet 1993 is thine’; who though I speak it
before his face, if he be not fellow with 1994 the best king, thou shalt
find the best king of good fellows. Come, your answer in broken music;
for thy voice is music and thy English broken: therefore, queen of all,
Katherine, break 1995 thy mind to me in broken</p>
<p>English; wilt thou have me?</p>
<p>KATHERINE Dat is as it sall please de roi mon père 1996 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please him,
Kate.</p>
<p>KATHERINE Den it sall also content me.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.</p>
<p>Tries to kiss her hand</p>
<p>KATHERINE Laissez, mon seigneur 1997 , laissez, laissez: ma foi, je
ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en baisant la main
d’une, de votre seigneurie, indigne serviteur. Excusez-moi, je vous
supplie, mon très-puissant seigneur .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.</p>
<p>KATHERINE Les dames et demoiselles pour être baisées devant leur
noces, il n’est pas la coutume de France 1998 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Madam my interpreter, what says she?</p>
<p>ALICE Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of France —— I
cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V To kiss.</p>
<p>ALICE Your majesty entendre bettre que moi 1999 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss
before they are married, would she say?</p>
<p>ALICE Oui, vraiment 2000 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V O, Kate, nice 2001 customs curtsy to great kings. Dear
Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list 2002 of a
country’s fashion: we are the makers of manners, Kate; and the liberty
that follows our places 2003 stops the mouth of all find-faults 2004 ,
as I will do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your country in
denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently and yielding. You have
witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is more eloquence in a sugar touch
of them than in the tongues of the French council; and they should
sooner persuade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs.
Here comes your father.</p>
<p>Kisses her</p>
<p>Enter the French power [King, Queen, Burgundy ] and the English
Lords</p>
<p>BURGUNDY God save your majesty! My royal cousin, teach you our
princess English?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I
love her, and that is good English.</p>
<p>BURGUNDY Is she not apt 2005 ?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition 2006 is not
smooth, so that, having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery
about me, I cannot so conjure 2007 up the spirit of love in her that he
will appear in his true likeness.</p>
<p>BURGUNDY Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you for that.
If you would conjure in her, you must make a circle 2008 : if conjure up
love in her in his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind 2009 .
Can you blame her then, being a maid 2010 yet rosed over with the virgin
crimson of modesty 2011 , if she deny the appearance of a naked blind
boy in 2012 her naked seeing 2013 self? It were, my lord, a hard 2014
condition for a maid to consign 2015 to.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Yet they do wink and yield 2016 , as love is blind and
enforces 2017 .</p>
<p>BURGUNDY They are then excused, my lord, when they see not what they
do 2018 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking
2019 .</p>
<p>BURGUNDY I will wink on 2020 her to consent, my lord, if you will
teach her to know 2021 my meaning, for maids, well summered 2022 and
warm 2023 kept, are like flies at Bartholomew- tide 2024 : blind, though
they have their eyes 2025 , and then they will endure handling 2026 ,
which before would not abide looking on.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V This moral 2027 ties me over 2028 to time and a hot
summer; and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the latter end
2029 and she must be blind too.</p>
<p>BURGUNDY As love is, my lord, before it loves 2030 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V It is so: and you may, some of you, thank love for my
blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French
maid that stands in my way.</p>
<p>FRENCH KING Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively 2031 , the
cities turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with maiden 2032
walls that war hath never entered 2033 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Shall Kate be my wife?</p>
<p>FRENCH KING So please you.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V I am content, so 2034 the maiden cities you talk of may
wait on her 2035 . So the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall
show me the way to my will 2036 .</p>
<p>FRENCH KING We have consented to all terms of reason 2037 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Is’t so, my lords of England?</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND The king hath granted every article:</p>
<p>His daughter first, and then in sequel 2038 all,</p>
<p>According to their firm proposèd natures.</p>
<p>EXETER Only he hath not yet subscribed 2039 this: where your majesty
demands, that the King of France, having any occasion to write for
matter of grant 2040 , shall name your highness in this form and with
this addition 2041 in French, Notre très cher fils Henri, Roi
d’Angleterre, Héritier de France 2042 : and thus in Latin,
Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex Angliae, et Haeres Franciae
2043 .</p>
<p>FRENCH KING Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,</p>
<p>But your request 2044 shall make me let it pass.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,</p>
<p>Let that one article rank with the rest,</p>
<p>And thereupon give me your daughter.</p>
<p>FRENCH KING Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up</p>
<p>Issue 2045 to me, that the contending kingdoms</p>
<p>Of France and England, whose very shores look pale 2046</p>
<p>With envy of each other’s happiness,</p>
<p>May cease their hatred, and this dear 2047 conjunction</p>
<p>Plant neighbourhood 2048 and Christian-like accord</p>
<p>In their sweet bosoms 2049 , that never war advance 2050</p>
<p>His bleeding sword ’twixt England and fair France.</p>
<p>LORDS Amen!</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Now, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,</p>
<p>That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.</p>
<p>Kisses her</p>
<p>Flourish</p>
<p>QUEEN ISABEL God, the best maker of all marriages,</p>
<p>Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!</p>
<p>As man and wife, being two, are one in love,</p>
<p>So be there ’twixt your kingdoms such a spousal 2051 ,</p>
<p>That never may ill office 2052 , or fell 2053 jealousy,</p>
<p>Which troubles oft the bed of blessèd marriage,</p>
<p>Thrust in between the paction 2054 of these kingdoms,</p>
<p>To make divorce of their incorporate 2055 league,</p>
<p>That English may as French, French Englishmen,</p>
<p>Receive each other. God speak this Amen!</p>
<p>ALL Amen!</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Prepare we for our marriage, on which day,</p>
<p>My lord of Burgundy, we’ll take your oath,</p>
<p>And all the peers’, for surety of our leagues 2056 .</p>
<p>Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me,</p>
<p>And may our oaths well kept and prosp’rous be!</p>
<p>Sennet 2057 . Exeunt</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Enter Chorus</p>
<p>CHORUS Thus far, with rough 2058 and all-unable 2059 pen,</p>
<p>Our bending 2060 author hath pursued the story,</p>
<p>In little room confining mighty men,</p>
<p>Mangling by starts 2061 the full course of their glory.</p>
<p>Small time 2062 , but in that small most greatly lived</p>
<p>This star of England. Fortune made his sword;</p>
<p>By which the world’s best garden 2063 be achieved,</p>
<p>And of it left his son imperial lord.</p>
<p>Henry the Sixth, in infant bands 2064 crowned King</p>
<p>Of France and England, did this king succeed,</p>
<p>Whose 2065 state so many had the managing,</p>
<p>That they lost France and made his England bleed,</p>
<p>Which oft our stage hath shown; and, for their 2066 sake,</p>
<p>In your fair minds let this acceptance take 2067 .</p>
