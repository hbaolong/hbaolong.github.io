<h4 id="scene-3-799-running-scene-8">Scene 3 799 / running scene 8</h4>
<p>Flourish. Enter Lewis the French King, his sister Bona, his Admiral
called Bourbon, Prince Edward, Queen Margaret and the Earl of Oxford.
Lewis sits and riseth up again</p>
<p>KING LEWIS Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,</p>
<p>Sit down with us. It ill befits thy state 800</p>
<p>And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET No, mighty King of France: now Margaret</p>
<p>Must strike her sail 801 and learn awhile to serve</p>
<p>Where kings command. I was, I must confess,</p>
<p>Great Albion’s 802 queen in former golden days,</p>
<p>But now mischance 803 hath trod my title down</p>
<p>And with dishonour laid me on the ground,</p>
<p>Where I must take like seat unto 804 my fortune,</p>
<p>And to my humble seat conform myself.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep
despair?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears</p>
<p>And stops my tongue, while heart is drowned in cares.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS Whate’er it be, be thou still like thyself 805 ,</p>
<p>And sit thee by our side:</p>
<p>Seats her by him</p>
<p>Yield not thy neck</p>
<p>To fortune’s yoke, but let thy dauntless mind</p>
<p>Still ride in triumph over all mischance.</p>
<p>Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief:</p>
<p>It shall be eased, if France 806 can yield relief.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts</p>
<p>And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.</p>
<p>Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis,</p>
<p>That Henry, sole possessor of my love,</p>
<p>Is, of 807 a king, become a banished man,</p>
<p>And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn 808 ;</p>
<p>While proud ambitious Edward, Duke of York,</p>
<p>Usurps the regal title and the seat</p>
<p>Of England’s true-anointed lawful king.</p>
<p>This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,</p>
<p>With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry’s heir,</p>
<p>Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid.</p>
<p>And if thou fail us, all our hope is done.</p>
<p>Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help,</p>
<p>Our people and our peers are both misled,</p>
<p>Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,</p>
<p>And, as thou see’st, ourselves in heavy 809 plight.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS Renownèd queen, with patience calm the storm 810 ,</p>
<p>While we bethink a means to break it off.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET The more we stay 811 , the stronger grows our foe.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS The more I stay 812 , the more I’ll succour 813 thee.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET O, but impatience waiteth on 814 true sorrow.</p>
<p>And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!</p>
<p>Enter Warwick</p>
<p>KING LEWIS What’s he approacheth boldly to our presence?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Our Earl of Warwick, Edward’s greatest friend.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS Welcome, brave Warwick. What brings thee to France?</p>
<p>He descends 815 . She ariseth</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Ay, now begins a second storm to rise,</p>
<p>For this is he that moves both wind and tide.</p>
<p>WARWICK From worthy Edward, King of Albion,</p>
<p>My lord and sovereign, and thy vowèd friend,</p>
<p>I come, in kindness and unfeignèd love,</p>
<p>First, to do greetings to thy royal person,</p>
<p>And then to crave a league of amity,</p>
<p>And lastly, to confirm that amity</p>
<p>With nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe 816 to grant</p>
<p>That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,</p>
<p>To England’s king in lawful marriage.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET If that go forward, Henry’s hope is done.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>WARWICK And, gracious madam, in 817 our king’s behalf,</p>
<p>Speaking to Bona</p>
<p>I am commanded, with your leave and favour,</p>
<p>Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue</p>
<p>To tell the passion of my sovereign’s heart;</p>
<p>Where fame 818 , late 819 ent’ring at his heedful 820 ears,</p>
<p>Hath placed thy beauty’s image and thy virtue.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,</p>
<p>Before you answer Warwick. His demand</p>
<p>Springs not from Edward’s well-meant honest love,</p>
<p>But from deceit bred by necessity.</p>
<p>For how can tyrants 821 safely govern home,</p>
<p>Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?</p>
<p>To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,</p>
<p>That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,</p>
<p>Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry’s son.</p>
<p>Look 822 , therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage</p>
<p>Thou draw not on thy 823 danger and dishonour,</p>
<p>For though usurpers sway the rule 824 awhile,</p>
<p>Yet heav’ns are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.</p>
<p>WARWICK Injurious 825 Margaret.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD And why not queen?</p>
<p>WARWICK Because thy father Henry did usurp,</p>
<p>And thou no more art prince than she is queen.</p>
<p>OXFORD Then Warwick disannuls 826 great John of Gaunt 827 ,</p>
<p>Which 828 did subdue the greatest part of Spain;</p>
<p>And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,</p>
<p>Whose wisdom was a mirror 829 to the wisest,</p>
<p>And after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,</p>
<p>Who by his prowess conquerèd all France:</p>
<p>From these our Henry lineally descends.</p>
<p>WARWICK Oxford, how haps 830 it, in this smooth 831 discourse,</p>
<p>You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost</p>
<p>All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?</p>
<p>Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.</p>
<p>But for the rest, you tell 832 a pedigree</p>
<p>Of threescore and two years 833 , a silly 834 time</p>
<p>To make prescription 835 for a kingdom’s worth.</p>
<p>OXFORD Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,</p>
<p>Whom thou obeyed’st thirty-and-six years 836 ,</p>
<p>And not bewray 837 thy treason with a blush?</p>
<p>WARWICK Can Oxford, that did ever fence 838 the right,</p>
<p>Now buckler 839 falsehood with a pedigree?</p>
<p>For shame, leave Henry and call Edward king.</p>
<p>OXFORD Call him my king by whose injurious doom 840</p>
<p>My elder brother, the lord Aubrey Vere 841 ,</p>
<p>Was done to death? And more than so 842 , my father,</p>
<p>Even in the downfall 843 of his mellowed 844 years,</p>
<p>When nature brought him to the door of death?</p>
<p>No, Warwick, no: while life upholds this arm,</p>
<p>This arm upholds the House of Lancaster.</p>
<p>WARWICK And I the House of York.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,</p>
<p>Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,</p>
<p>While I use 845 further conference 846 with Warwick.</p>
<p>They stand aloof 847</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Heavens grant that Warwick’s words bewitch him
not.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS Now Warwick, tell me, even 848 upon thy conscience,</p>
<p>Is Edward your true king? For I were loath</p>
<p>To link with him that were not lawful chosen.</p>
<p>WARWICK Thereon I pawn 849 my credit 850 and mine honour.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS But is he gracious 851 in the people’s eye?</p>
<p>WARWICK The more that 852 Henry was unfortunate.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS Then further, all dissembling 853 set aside,</p>
<p>Tell me for truth 854 the measure 855 of his love</p>
<p>Unto our sister Bona.</p>
<p>WARWICK Such it seems</p>
<p>As may beseem 856 a monarch like himself.</p>
<p>Myself have often heard him say and swear</p>
<p>That this his love was an external 857 plant,</p>
<p>Whereof the root was fixed in virtue’s ground,</p>
<p>The leaves and fruit maintained with beauty’s sun,</p>
<p>Exempt from envy 858 , but not from disdain 859 ,</p>
<p>Unless the lady Bona quit 860 his pain.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.</p>
<p>BONA Your grant 861 , or your denial, shall be mine 862 .—</p>
<p>Yet I confess that often ere this day,</p>
<p>Speaks to Warwick</p>
<p>When I have heard your king’s desert 863 recounted,</p>
<p>Mine ear hath tempted judgement to desire.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward’s.</p>
<p>And now forthwith shall articles 864 be drawn 865</p>
<p>Touching 866 the jointure 867 that your king must make,</p>
<p>Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised 868 .—</p>
<p>Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness</p>
<p>That Bona shall be wife to the English king.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD To Edward, but not to the English king.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device 869</p>
<p>By this alliance to make void my suit.</p>
<p>Before thy coming Lewis was Henry’s friend.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS And still is friend to him and Margaret.</p>
<p>But if your title to the crown be weak,</p>
<p>As may appear by Edward’s good success 870 ,</p>
<p>Then ’tis but reason that I be released</p>
<p>From giving aid which late 871 I promisèd.</p>
<p>Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand</p>
<p>That your estate 872 requires and mine can yield.</p>
<p>WARWICK Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,</p>
<p>Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.</p>
<p>And as for you yourself, our quondam 873 queen,</p>
<p>You have a father able to maintain you,</p>
<p>And better ’twere you troubled him than France.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick,</p>
<p>Proud setter-up and puller-down of kings.</p>
<p>I will not hence 874 , till with my talk and tears —</p>
<p>Both full of truth — I make King Lewis behold</p>
<p>Thy sly conveyance 875 and thy lord’s false love,</p>
<p>Post 876 blowing a horn within</p>
<p>For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.</p>
<p>Enter the Post</p>
<p>POST My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,</p>
<p>Speaks to Warwick</p>
<p>Sent from your brother, Marquis Montague.—</p>
<p>These from our king unto your majesty.—</p>
<p>To Lewis</p>
<p>And, madam, these for you, from whom I know not.</p>
<p>To Margaret</p>
<p>They all read their letters</p>
<p>OXFORD I like it well that our fair queen and mistress</p>
<p>Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as 877 he were nettled.</p>
<p>I hope all’s for the best.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS Warwick, what are thy news?— And yours, fair queen?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped 878 joys.</p>
<p>WARWICK Mine, full of sorrow and heart’s discontent.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS What? Has your king married the Lady Grey?</p>
<p>And now, to soothe 879 your forgery 880 and his,</p>
<p>Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?</p>
<p>Is this th’alliance that he seeks with France?</p>
<p>Dare he presume to scorn 881 us in this manner?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET I told your majesty as much before:</p>
<p>This proveth Edward’s love and Warwick’s honesty.</p>
<p>WARWICK King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven</p>
<p>And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,</p>
<p>That I am clear from 882 this misdeed of Edward’s,</p>
<p>No more my king, for he dishonours me,</p>
<p>But most himself, if he could see his shame.</p>
<p>Did I forget that by the house of York</p>
<p>My father came untimely 883 to his death 884 ?</p>
<p>Did I let pass th’abuse done to my niece 885 ?</p>
<p>Did I impale him 886 with the regal crown?</p>
<p>Did I put 887 Henry from his native right?</p>
<p>And am I guerdoned 888 at the last with shame?</p>
<p>Shame on himself, for my desert 889 is honour.</p>
<p>And to repair my honour lost for him,</p>
<p>I here renounce him and return to Henry.—</p>
<p>My noble queen, let former grudges pass,</p>
<p>And henceforth I am thy true servitor 890 .</p>
<p>I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,</p>
<p>And replant Henry in his former state.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Warwick, these words have turned my hate to love,</p>
<p>And I forgive and quite forget old faults,</p>
<p>And joy 891 that thou becom’st King Henry’s friend.</p>
<p>WARWICK So much his friend, ay, his unfeignèd 892 friend,</p>
<p>That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish 893 us</p>
<p>With some few bands 894 of chosen soldiers,</p>
<p>I’ll undertake to land them on our coast</p>
<p>And force the tyrant from his seat by war.</p>
<p>’Tis not his new-made bride shall succour him.</p>
<p>And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,</p>
<p>He’s very likely now to fall from 895 him</p>
<p>For matching 896 more for wanton lust than honour,</p>
<p>Or than for strength and safety of our country.</p>
<p>BONA Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged</p>
<p>But by thy help to this distressèd queen?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Renownèd prince, how shall poor Henry live,</p>
<p>Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?</p>
<p>BONA My quarrel and this English queen’s are one.</p>
<p>WARWICK And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret’s.</p>
<p>Therefore at last I firmly am resolved</p>
<p>You shall have aid.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Let me give humble thanks for all at once.</p>
<p>KING LEWIS Then, England’s messenger, return in post 897</p>
<p>And tell false Edward, thy supposèd king,</p>
<p>That Lewis of France is sending over masquers 898</p>
<p>To revel it with him and his new bride.</p>
<p>Thou see’st what’s passed 899 , go fear 900 thy king withal 901 .</p>
<p>BONA Tell him, in hope he’ll prove a widower shortly,</p>
<p>I’ll wear the willow garland 902 for his sake.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Tell him, my mourning weeds 903 are laid aside,</p>
<p>And I am ready to put armour on.</p>
<p>WARWICK Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,</p>
<p>And therefore I’ll uncrown him ere’t be 904 long.</p>
<p>There’s thy reward 905 . Be gone.</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>Exit Post</p>
<p>KING LEWIS But, Warwick,</p>
<p>Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men</p>
<p>Shall cross the seas, and bid 906 false Edward battle.</p>
<p>And, as occasion 907 serves, this noble queen</p>
<p>And prince shall follow with a fresh supply 908 .</p>
<p>Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt:</p>
<p>What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?</p>
<p>WARWICK This shall assure my constant loyalty,</p>
<p>That if our queen and this young prince agree,</p>
<p>I’ll join mine eldest daughter 909 and my joy</p>
<p>To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands 910 .</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion 911 .—</p>
<p>Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous:</p>
<p>Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick,</p>
<p>And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,</p>
<p>That only Warwick’s daughter shall be thine.</p>
<p>PRINCE EDWARD Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it.</p>
<p>And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.</p>
<p>He gives his hand to Warwick</p>
<p>KING LEWIS Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied.—</p>
<p>And thou, Lord Bourbon, our High Admiral,</p>
<p>Shall waft 912 them over with our royal fleet.</p>
<p>I long till Edward fall by war’s mischance,</p>
<p>For mocking marriage with a dame of France.</p>
<p>Exeunt. Warwick remains</p>
<p>WARWICK I came from Edward as ambassador,</p>
<p>But I return his sworn and mortal foe:</p>
<p>Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,</p>
<p>But dreadful war shall answer his demand.</p>
<p>Had he none else to make a stale 913 but me?</p>
<p>Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.</p>
<p>I was the chief that raised him to the crown,</p>
<p>And I’ll be chief to bring him down again,</p>
<p>Not that I pity Henry’s misery,</p>
<p>But seek revenge on Edward’s mockery.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
