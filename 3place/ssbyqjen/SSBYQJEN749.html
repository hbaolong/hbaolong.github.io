10</h4>
<p>Enter the King, Bedford and Gloucester</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Gloucester, ’tis true that we are in great danger,</p>
<p>The greater therefore should our courage be.——</p>
<p>Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!</p>
<p>There is some soul of goodness in things evil,</p>
<p>Would men 1241 observingly 1242 distil 1243 it out.</p>
<p>For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers 1244 ,</p>
<p>Which is both healthful and good husbandry 1245 .</p>
<p>Besides, they are our outward consciences</p>
<p>And preachers to us all, admonishing</p>
<p>That we should dress us 1246 fairly for our end.</p>
<p>Thus may we gather honey from the weed 1247 ,</p>
<p>And make a moral of 1248 the devil himself.——</p>
<p>Enter Erpingham</p>
<p>Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham:</p>
<p>A good soft pillow for that good white head</p>
<p>Were better than a churlish 1249 turf of France.</p>
<p>ERPINGHAM Not so, my liege. This lodging likes 1250 me better,</p>
<p>Since I may say ‘Now lie I like a king.’</p>
<p>KING HENRY V ’Tis good for men to love their present pains</p>
<p>Upon example 1251 , so the spirit is eased:</p>
<p>And when the mind is quickened 1252 , out of doubt,</p>
<p>The organs, though defunct and dead before,</p>
<p>Break up 1253 their drowsy grave and newly move</p>
<p>With casted slough 1254 and fresh legerity 1255 .</p>
<p>Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,</p>
<p>Commend me 1256 to the princes in our camp;</p>
<p>Do my good morrow to them, and anon 1257</p>
<p>Desire them all to my pavilion 1258 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER We shall, my liege.</p>
<p>ERPINGHAM Shall I attend your grace?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V No, my good knight.</p>
<p>Go with my brothers to my lords of England:</p>
<p>I and my bosom 1259 must debate awhile</p>
<p>Covers himself with</p>
<p>Erpingham’s cloak</p>
<p>And then I would no other company.</p>
<p>ERPINGHAM The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!</p>
<p>Exeunt [all but King Henry ]</p>
<p>KING HENRY V God-a-mercy, old heart! Thou speak’st cheerfully.</p>
<p>Enter Pistol</p>
<p>PISTOL Che vous là 1260 ?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V A friend.</p>
<p>PISTOL Discuss 1261 unto me: art thou officer?</p>
<p>Or art thou base, common and popular 1262 ?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V I am a gentleman of a company 1263 .</p>
<p>PISTOL Trail’st thou the puissant pike? 1264</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Even so 1265 . What are you?</p>
<p>PISTOL As good a gentleman as the emperor.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Then you are a better than the king.</p>
<p>PISTOL The king’s a bawcock 1266 , and a heart of gold,</p>
<p>A lad of life, an imp 1267 of fame,</p>
<p>Of parents good, of fist most valiant.</p>
<p>I kiss his dirty shoe and from heartstring</p>
<p>I love the lovely bully 1268 . What is thy name?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Harry le Roy 1269 .</p>
<p>PISTOL Le Roy? A Cornish name: art thou of Cornish crew 1270 ?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V No, I am a Welshman.</p>
<p>PISTOL Know’st thou Fluellen?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Yes.</p>
<p>PISTOL Tell him I’ll knock his leek about his pate 1271</p>
<p>Upon Saint Davy’s day 1272 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day, lest
he knock that about yours.</p>
<p>PISTOL Art thou his friend?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V And his kinsman too.</p>
<p>PISTOL The figo for thee, then!</p>
<p>KING HENRY V I thank you. God be with you!</p>
<p>PISTOL My name is Pistol called.</p>
<p>Exit. The King remains [and stands aside ]</p>
<p>KING HENRY V It sorts 1273 well with your fierceness.</p>
<p>Enter Fluellen and Gower</p>
<p>GOWER Captain Fluellen!</p>
<p>FLUELLEN So, in the name of Jesu Christ, speak fewer 1274 . It is the
greatest admiration 1275 in the universal world, when the true and
aunchient prerogatifes 1276 and laws of the wars is not kept: if you
would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great 1277 ,
you shall find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle taddle nor pibble
1278 babble in Pompey’s camp. I warrant you, you shall find the
ceremonies 1279 of the wars, and the cares 1280 of it, and the forms
1281 of it, and the sobriety 1282 of it, and the modesty 1283 of it, to
be otherwise 1284 .</p>
<p>GOWER Why, the enemy is loud. You hear him all night.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating 1285 coxcomb
1286 , is it meet, think you, that we should also, look you, be an ass
and a fool and a prating coxcomb, in your own conscience, now?</p>
<p>GOWER I will speak lower.</p>
<p>FLUELLEN I pray you and beseech you that you will.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Gower and Fluellen ]</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Though it appear a little out of fashion,</p>
<p>There is much care 1287 and valour in this Welshman.</p>
<p>Enter three soldiers: John Bates, Alexander Court and Michael
Williams</p>
<p>COURT Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which breaks
yonder?</p>
<p>BATES I think it be. But we have no great cause to desire the
approach of day.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think we shall
never see the end of it.—— Who goes there?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V A friend.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS Under what captain serve you?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS A good old commander and a most kind gentleman. I pray you,
what thinks he of our estate 1288 ?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Even as men wrecked 1289 upon a sand 1290 , that look to
be washed off the next tide.</p>
<p>BATES He hath not told his thought to the king?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V No, nor it is not meet he should. For, though I speak it
1291 to you, I think the king is but a man, as I am: the violet smells
to him as it doth to me: the element 1292 shows to him as it doth to me;
all his senses have but human conditions 1293 , his ceremonies 1294 laid
by 1295 , in his nakedness he appears but a man; and though his
affections 1296 are higher mounted 1297 than ours, yet, when they stoop
1298 , they stoop with the like wing 1299 . Therefore, when he sees
reason of 1300 fears, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same
relish 1301 as ours are. Yet, in reason, no man should possess him with
1302 any appearance of fear, lest he 1303 , by showing it, should
dishearten his army.</p>
<p>BATES He may show what outward courage he will, but I believe, as
cold a night as ’tis, he could wish himself in Thames 1304 up to the
neck; and so I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures 1305 , so
we were quit 1306 here.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king: I
think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is.</p>
<p>BATES Then I would he were here alone; so should he be sure to be
ransomed, and a many poor men’s lives saved.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here
alone, howsoever you speak this to feel 1307 other men’s minds. Methinks
I could not die anywhere so contented as in the king’s company; his
cause being just and his quarrel honourable.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS That’s more than we know.</p>
<p>BATES Ay, or more than we should seek after 1308 ; for we know
enough, if we know we are the king’s subjects. If his cause be wrong,
our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath a heavy
reckoning 1309 to make, when all those legs and arms and heads, chopped
off in a battle, shall join together 1310 at the latter day 1311 and cry
all, ‘We died at such a place’ —— some swearing, some crying for a
surgeon, some upon 1312 their wives left poor behind them, some upon the
debts they owe, some upon their children rawly 1313 left. I am afeard
1314 there are few die well that die in a battle, for how can they
charitably 1315 dispose of 1316 anything, when blood is their argument
1317 ? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for
the king that led them to it —— who to disobey were against all
proportion 1318 of subjection 1319 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY V So, if a son that is by his father sent about
merchandise 1320 do sinfully miscarry 1321 upon the sea, the imputation
of 1322 his wickedness, by your rule, should be imposed upon his father
that sent him. Or if a servant, under his master’s command transporting
a sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled 1323
iniquities 1324 , you may call the business of the master the author
1325 of the servant’s damnation. But this is not so: the king is not
bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of
his son, nor the master of his servant; for they purpose 1326 not their
death, when they purpose their services. Besides, there is no king, be
his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrement of swords
1327 , can try it out 1328 with all unspotted 1329 soldiers: some
peradventure 1330 have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived
murder; some, of beguiling 1331 virgins with the broken seals of perjury
1332 ; some, making the wars their bulwark 1333 , that have before gored
the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men
have defeated the law and outrun native punishment 1334 , though they
can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God. War is his beadle
1335 , war is his vengeance, so that here men are punished for
before-breach 1336 of the king’s laws in now the king’s quarrel 1337 .
Where they feared the death 1338 , they have borne life away 1339 ; and
where they would be safe, they perish. Then if they die unprovided 1340
, no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before
guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited 1341 .
Every subject’s duty is the king’s, but every subject’s soul is his own.
Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his
bed, wash every mote out of his conscience, and dying so, death is to
him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly 1342 lost 1343
wherein such preparation was gained. And in him that escapes, it were
not sin to think that, making God so free an offer 1344 , he let him
outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they
should prepare 1345 .</p>
<p>WILLIAMS ’Tis certain, every man that dies ill 1346 , the ill upon
his own head, the king is not to answer it 1347 .</p>
<p>BATES But I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet I
determine to fight lustily 1348 for him.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V I myself heard the king say he would not be
ransomed.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully. But when our
throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we ne’er the wiser.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V If I live to see it 1349 , I will never trust his word
after.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS You pay 1350 him then. That’s a perilous 1351 shot out of an
elder-gun 1352 , that a poor and a private displeasure 1353 can do
against a monarch. You may as well go about 1354 to turn the sun to ice
with fanning in his face with a peacock’s feather. You’ll never trust
his word after! Come, ’tis a foolish saying.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Your reproof is something too round 1355 . I should be
angry with you, if the time were convenient.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V I embrace 1356 it.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS How shall I know thee again?</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Give me any gage 1357 of thine, and I will wear it in my
bonnet 1358 : then, if ever thou darest 1359 acknowledge it, I will make
it my quarrel.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS Here’s my glove. Give me another of thine.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V There.</p>
<p>They exchange</p>
<p>gloves</p>
<p>WILLIAMS This will I also wear in my cap. If ever thou come to me and
say, after tomorrow, ‘This is my glove’, by this hand, I will take 1360
thee a box on the ear.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS Thou dar’st as well be hanged.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Well, I will do it, though 1361 I take 1362 thee in the
king’s company.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS Keep thy word. Fare thee well.</p>
<p>BATES Be friends, you English fools, be friends. We have French
quarrels enough, if you could tell how to reckon 1363 .</p>
<p>Exeunt Soldiers</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns 1364 to
one, they will beat us; for they bear them on their shoulders. But it is
no English treason to cut French crowns 1365 , and tomorrow the king
himself will be a clipper 1366 .</p>
<p>Upon the king! Let us our lives, our souls,</p>
<p>Our debts, our careful 1367 wives,</p>
<p>Our children and our sins lay on 1368 the king!</p>
<p>We must bear all. O, hard condition 1369 ,</p>
<p>Twin-born 1370 with greatness, subject to the breath 1371</p>
<p>Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel</p>
<p>But his own wringing 1372 . What infinite heart’s-ease 1373</p>
<p>Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy?</p>
<p>And what have kings, that privates 1374 have not too,</p>
<p>Save 1375 ceremony, save general 1376 ceremony?</p>
<p>And what art thou, thou idle 1377 ceremony?</p>
<p>What kind of god art thou, that suffer’st more</p>
<p>Of mortal 1378 griefs than do thy worshippers?</p>
<p>What are thy rents? What are thy comings in 1379 ?</p>
<p>O ceremony, show me but thy worth.</p>
<p>What? Is thy soul of adoration 1380 ?</p>
<p>Art thou aught 1381 else but place, degree and form 1382 ,</p>
<p>Creating awe and fear in other men?</p>
<p>Wherein thou art less happy being feared</p>
<p>Than they in fearing.</p>
<p>What drink’st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,</p>
<p>But poisoned flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,</p>
<p>And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!</p>
<p>Think’st thou the fiery fever will go out</p>
<p>With titles 1383 blown 1384 from adulation?</p>
<p>Will it give place 1385 to flexure 1386 and low bending 1387 ?</p>
<p>Canst thou, when thou command’st the beggar’s knee 1388 ,</p>
<p>Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,</p>
<p>That play’st so subtly 1389 with a king’s repose 1390 .</p>
<p>I am a king that find thee 1391 , and I know</p>
<p>’Tis not the balm 1392 , the sceptre and the ball 1393 ,</p>
<p>The sword, the mace 1394 , the crown imperial,</p>
<p>The intertissued 1395 robe of gold and pearl,</p>
<p>The farcèd 1396 title running ’fore the king,</p>
<p>The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp 1397</p>
<p>That beats upon the high shore of this world.</p>
<p>No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,</p>
<p>Not all these, laid in bed majestical,</p>
<p>Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,</p>
<p>Who with a body filled and vacant mind</p>
<p>Gets him to rest, crammed with distressful 1398 bread,</p>
<p>Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,</p>
<p>But like a lackey 1399 , from the rise to set 1400 ,</p>
<p>Sweats in the eye of Phoebus 1401 and all night</p>
<p>Sleeps in Elysium 1402 : next day after dawn,</p>
<p>Doth rise and help Hyperion 1403 to his horse,</p>
<p>And follows so the ever-running year,</p>
<p>With profitable 1404 labour, to his grave.</p>
<p>And but for ceremony, such a wretch,</p>
<p>Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,</p>
<p>Had the forehand and vantage of 1405 a king.</p>
<p>The slave, a member 1406 of the country’s peace,</p>
<p>Enjoys it; but in gross 1407 brain little wots 1408</p>
<p>What watch 1409 the king keeps to maintain the peace,</p>
<p>Whose hours the peasant best advantages 1410 .</p>
<p>Enter Erpingham</p>
<p>ERPINGHAM My lord, your nobles, jealous of 1411 your absence,</p>
<p>Seek through your camp to find you.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V Good old knight,</p>
<p>Collect them all together at my tent:</p>
<p>I’ll be before thee.</p>
<p>ERPINGHAM I shall do’t, my lord.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KING HENRY V O God of battles, steel my soldiers’ hearts,</p>
<p>Possess them not with fear. Take from them now</p>
<p>The sense of reck’ning 1412 , ere th’opposèd numbers 1413</p>
<p>Pluck their hearts from them. Not today, O lord,</p>
<p>O, not today, think not upon the fault</p>
<p>My father made in compassing 1414 the crown! 1415</p>
<p>I Richard’s body have interrèd new 1416 ,</p>
<p>And on it have bestowed more contrite tears</p>
<p>Than from it issued forcèd 1417 drops of blood 1418 .</p>
<p>Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay,</p>
<p>Who twice a day their withered hands hold up</p>
<p>Toward heaven, to pardon blood, and I have built</p>
<p>Two chantries 1419 , where the sad 1420 and solemn priests</p>
<p>Sing still 1421 for Richard’s soul. More will I do,</p>
<p>Though all that I can do is nothing worth,</p>
<p>Since that my penitence comes after all,</p>
<p>Imploring pardon.</p>
<p>Enter Gloucester</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER My liege.</p>
<p>KING HENRY V My brother Gloucester’s voice?—— Ay,</p>
<p>I know thy errand. I will go with thee.</p>
<p>The day, my friends, and all things stay 1422 for me.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
