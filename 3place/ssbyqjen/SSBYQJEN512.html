<h4 id="scene-6-running-scene-15">Scene 6 / running scene 15</h4>
<p>Enter King and Laertes</p>
<p>KING Now must your conscience my acquittance seal 1519 ,</p>
<p>And you must put me in your heart for friend,</p>
<p>Sith 1520 you have heard, and with a knowing 1521 ear,</p>
<p>That he which hath your noble father slain</p>
<p>Pursued my life.</p>
<p>LAERTES It well appears. But tell me</p>
<p>Why you proceeded not 1522 against these feats 1523</p>
<p>So crimeful and so capital 1524 in nature,</p>
<p>As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,</p>
<p>You mainly were stirred up 1525 .</p>
<p>KING O, for two special reasons,</p>
<p>Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinewed 1526 ,</p>
<p>And yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother</p>
<p>Lives almost by his looks, and for myself —</p>
<p>My virtue or my plague, be it either which —</p>
<p>She’s so conjunctive 1527 to my life and soul,</p>
<p>That, as the star moves not but in his sphere 1528 ,</p>
<p>I could not but 1529 by her. The other motive,</p>
<p>Why to a public count 1530 I might not go,</p>
<p>Is the great love the general gender 1531 1532 bear him,</p>
<p>Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,</p>
<p>Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone 1533 ,</p>
<p>Convert his gyves 1534 to graces, so that my arrows,</p>
<p>Too slightly timbered 1535 for so loud a wind,</p>
<p>Would have reverted to my bow again</p>
<p>And not where I had aimed them.</p>
<p>LAERTES And so have I a noble father lost,</p>
<p>A sister driven into desperate terms 1536 ,</p>
<p>Who has — if praises may go back again 1537 —</p>
<p>Stood challenger on mount 1538 of all the age</p>
<p>For her perfections: but my revenge will come.</p>
<p>KING Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think</p>
<p>That we are made of stuff so flat and dull</p>
<p>That we can let our beard be shook with 1539 danger</p>
<p>And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:</p>
<p>I loved your father, and we love ourself,</p>
<p>And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine—</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>How now? What news?</p>
<p>MESSENGER Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:</p>
<p>This to your majesty, this to the queen.</p>
<p>Gives letters</p>
<p>KING From Hamlet? Who brought them?</p>
<p>MESSENGER Sailors, my lord, they say: I saw them not.</p>
<p>They were given me by Claudio 1540 : he received them.</p>
<p>KING Laertes, you shall hear them.— Leave us.</p>
<p>Exit Messenger</p>
<p>‘High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked 1541 on your kingdom.
Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes, when I shall, first
asking your pardon 1542 thereunto, recount th’occasions of my sudden and
more strange return. Hamlet.’ What should this mean? Are all the rest
come back?</p>
<p>Or is it some abuse 1543 ? Or no such thing 1544 ?</p>
<p>LAERTES Know you the hand?</p>
<p>KING ‘Tis Hamlet’s character 1545 . ’Naked’ —</p>
<p>And in a postscript here, he says ‘alone’.</p>
<p>Can you advise me?</p>
<p>LAERTES I’m lost in it, my lord. But let him come:</p>
<p>It warms the very sickness in my heart</p>
<p>That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,</p>
<p>‘Thus diest thou.’</p>
<p>KING If it be so, Laertes —</p>
<p>As how should it be so? How otherwise? —</p>
<p>Will you be ruled by me?</p>
<p>LAERTES If so 1546 you’ll not o’errule me to a peace.</p>
<p>KING To thine own peace. If he be now returned,</p>
<p>As checking at 1547 his voyage, and that he means</p>
<p>No more to undertake it, I will work him</p>
<p>To an exploit, now ripe in my device 1548 ,</p>
<p>Under the which he shall not choose but fall;</p>
<p>And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,</p>
<p>But even his mother shall uncharge the practice 1549</p>
<p>And call it accident. Some two months since,</p>
<p>Here was a gentleman of Normandy.</p>
<p>I’ve seen myself, and served against, the French,</p>
<p>And they can well 1550 on horseback; but this gallant 1551</p>
<p>Had witchcraft in’t; he grew into his seat,</p>
<p>And to such wondrous doing brought his horse</p>
<p>As 1552 had he been incorpsed 1553 and demi-natured 1554</p>
<p>With the brave 1555 beast: so far he passed my thought 1556 ,</p>
<p>That I in forgery of shapes and tricks 1557</p>
<p>Come short of what he did.</p>
<p>LAERTES A Norman was’t?</p>
<p>KING A Norman.</p>
<p>LAERTES Upon my life, Lamond 1558 .</p>
<p>KING The very same.</p>
<p>LAERTES I know him well: he is the brooch 1559 indeed</p>
<p>And gem of all our nation.</p>
<p>KING He made confession of you 1560 ,</p>
<p>And gave you such a masterly report</p>
<p>For art and exercise in your defence 1561 ,</p>
<p>And for your rapier most especially,</p>
<p>That he cried out, ’twould be a sight indeed</p>
<p>If one could match you. Sir, this report of his</p>
<p>Did Hamlet so envenom 1562 with his envy</p>
<p>That he could nothing do but wish and beg</p>
<p>Your sudden 1563 coming o’er, to play 1564 with him.</p>
<p>Now, out of this—</p>
<p>LAERTES What out of this, my lord?</p>
<p>KING Laertes, was your father dear to you?</p>
<p>Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,</p>
<p>A face without a heart?</p>
<p>LAERTES Why ask you this?</p>
<p>KING Not that I think you did not love your father,</p>
<p>But that I know love is begun by time 1565 ,</p>
<p>And that I see, in passages of proof 1566 ,</p>
<p>Time qualifies 1567 the spark and fire of it.</p>
<p>Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake</p>
<p>To show yourself your father’s son in deed</p>
<p>More than in words?</p>
<p>LAERTES To cut his throat i’th’church.</p>
<p>KING No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize 1568 ;</p>
<p>Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,</p>
<p>Will you 1569 do this, keep close 1570 within your chamber.</p>
<p>Hamlet returned shall know you are come home:</p>
<p>We’ll put on 1571 those shall praise your excellence</p>
<p>And set a double varnish on the fame</p>
<p>The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine 1572 together</p>
<p>And wager on your heads: he, being remiss 1573 ,</p>
<p>Most generous 1574 and free from all contriving,</p>
<p>Will not peruse 1575 the foils 1576 , so that with ease,</p>
<p>Or with a little shuffling, you may choose</p>
<p>A sword unbated 1577 , and in a pass of practice 1578</p>
<p>Requite 1579 him for your father.</p>
<p>LAERTES I will do’t,</p>
<p>And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword.</p>
<p>I bought an unction 1580 of a mountebank 1581</p>
<p>So mortal I but dipped a knife in it 1582 ,</p>
<p>Where it draws blood no cataplasm 1583 so rare 1584 ,</p>
<p>Collected from all simples 1585 that have virtue</p>
<p>Under the moon 1586 , can save the thing from death</p>
<p>That is but scratched withal 1587 : I’ll touch my point</p>
<p>With this contagion 1588 , that if I gall 1589 him slightly,</p>
<p>It may be death.</p>
<p>KING Let’s further think of this,</p>
<p>Weigh what convenience both of time and means</p>
<p>May fit us to our shape 1590 : if this should fail,</p>
<p>And that our drift 1591 look 1592 through our bad performance,</p>
<p>’Twere better not assayed: therefore this project</p>
<p>Should have a back or second, that might hold,</p>
<p>If this should blast in proof 1593 . Soft, let me see:</p>
<p>We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings 1594 .</p>
<p>I ha’t 1595 :</p>
<p>When in your motion you are hot and dry —</p>
<p>As 1596 make your bouts 1597 more violent to the end —</p>
<p>And that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepared him</p>
<p>A chalice for the nonce 1598 , whereon but sipping,</p>
<p>If he by chance escape your venomed stuck 1599 ,</p>
<p>Our purpose may hold there.—</p>
<p>Enter Queen</p>
<p>How now, sweet queen?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE One woe doth tread upon another’s heel,</p>
<p>So fast they’ll follow: your sister’s drowned, Laertes.</p>
<p>LAERTES Drowned? O, where?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE There is a willow 1600 grows aslant a brook,</p>
<p>That shows his hoar 1601 leaves in the glassy stream:</p>
<p>There with fantastic 1602 garlands did she come</p>
<p>Of crow-flowers 1603 , nettles, daisies and long purples 1604</p>
<p>That liberal 1605 shepherds give a grosser 1606 name,</p>
<p>But our cold 1607 maids do dead men’s fingers call them:</p>
<p>There on the pendent 1608 boughs her coronet weeds</p>
<p>Clamb’ring to hang, an envious sliver 1609 broke,</p>
<p>When down the weedy 1610 trophies and herself</p>
<p>Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,</p>
<p>And mermaid-like awhile they bore her up,</p>
<p>Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes,</p>
<p>As one incapable 1611 of her own distress 1612 ,</p>
<p>Or like a creature native and indued 1613</p>
<p>Unto that element: but long it could not be</p>
<p>Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,</p>
<p>Pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay 1614</p>
<p>To muddy death.</p>
<p>LAERTES Alas, then, is she drowned?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Drowned, drowned.</p>
<p>LAERTES Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,</p>
<p>And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet</p>
<p>It is our trick 1615 : nature her custom holds,</p>
<p>Let shame say what it will: when these 1616 are gone,</p>
<p>Weeps</p>
<p>The woman will be out 1617 .— Adieu, my lord:</p>
<p>I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze,</p>
<p>But that this folly 1618 douts 1619 it.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KING Let’s follow, Gertrude:</p>
<p>How much I had to do to calm his rage!</p>
<p>Now fear I this will give it start again;</p>
<p>Therefore let’s follow.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
