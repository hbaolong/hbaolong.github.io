8</h4>
<p>Enter Ulysses, Diomedes, Nestor, Agamemnon, Menelaus and Calchas.
Flourish</p>
<p>CALCHAS Now, princes, for the service I have done you,</p>
<p>Th’advantage 1378 of the time prompts me aloud</p>
<p>To call for recompense. Appear it 1379 to your mind</p>
<p>That through the sight 1380 I bear in things to come,</p>
<p>I have abandoned Troy, left my possession 1381 ,</p>
<p>Incurred a traitor’s name, exposed myself,</p>
<p>From 1382 certain and possessed conveniences 1383 ,</p>
<p>To doubtful fortunes, sequest’ring 1384 from me all</p>
<p>That time, acquaintance, custom and condition 1385</p>
<p>Made tame 1386 and most familiar to my nature,</p>
<p>And here, to do you service, am become</p>
<p>As 1387 new into the world, strange 1388 , unacquainted 1389 .</p>
<p>I do beseech you, as in way of taste 1390 ,</p>
<p>To give me now a little benefit</p>
<p>Out of those many registered in promise 1391 ,</p>
<p>Which, you say, live to come 1392 in my behalf.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? Make demand.</p>
<p>CALCHAS You have a Trojan prisoner, called Antenor,</p>
<p>Yesterday took 1393 : Troy holds him very dear.</p>
<p>Oft have you — often have you thanks therefore 1394 —</p>
<p>Desired my Cressid in right great exchange 1395 ,</p>
<p>Whom Troy hath still denied. But this Antenor,</p>
<p>I know is such a wrest 1396 in their affairs</p>
<p>That their negotiations all must slack 1397 ,</p>
<p>Wanting his manage 1398 , and they will almost</p>
<p>Give us a prince of blood 1399 , a son of Priam,</p>
<p>In change of 1400 him: let him be sent, great princes,</p>
<p>And he shall buy my daughter, and her presence</p>
<p>Shall quite strike off 1401 all service I have done,</p>
<p>In most accepted pain 1402 .</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Let Diomedes bear him 1403 ,</p>
<p>And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have</p>
<p>What he requests of us. Good Diomed,</p>
<p>Furnish you fairly 1404 for this interchange 1405 .</p>
<p>Withal 1406 bring word if Hector will tomorrow</p>
<p>Be answered in 1407 his challenge: Ajax is ready.</p>
<p>DIOMEDES This shall I undertake, and ’tis a burden</p>
<p>Which I am proud to bear.</p>
<p>Exit [Diomedes with Calchas ]</p>
<p>Enter Achilles and Patroclus in their tent</p>
<p>ULYSSES Achilles stands i’th’entrance of his tent;</p>
<p>Please it 1408 our general to pass strangely 1409 by him,</p>
<p>As if he were forgot, and, princes all,</p>
<p>Lay negligent and loose 1410 regard 1411 upon him;</p>
<p>I will come last. ’Tis like 1412 he’ll question me</p>
<p>Why such unplausive 1413 eyes are bent, why turned on him.</p>
<p>If so, I have derision medicinable 1414</p>
<p>To use between your strangeness and his pride,</p>
<p>Which his own will shall have desire to drink;</p>
<p>It may do good: pride hath no other glass 1415</p>
<p>To show itself but pride, for supple knees</p>
<p>Feed arrogance and are the proud man’s fees 1416 .</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON We’ll execute your purpose 1417 , and put on</p>
<p>A form 1418 of strangeness as we pass along:</p>
<p>So do each lord, and either greet him not</p>
<p>Or else disdainfully, which shall shake 1419 him more</p>
<p>Than if not looked on. I will lead the way.</p>
<p>ACHILLES What, comes the general to speak with me?</p>
<p>You know my mind: I’ll fight no more gainst Troy.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON What says Achilles? Would he aught 1420 with us?</p>
<p>NESTOR Would you, my lord, aught with the general?</p>
<p>ACHILLES No.</p>
<p>NESTOR Nothing, my lord.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON The better 1421 .</p>
<p>[Exeunt Agamemnon and Nestor ]</p>
<p>ACHILLES Good day, good day.</p>
<p>To Menelaus</p>
<p>MENELAUS How do you? How do you?</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>ACHILLES What, does the cuckold scorn me?</p>
<p>AJAX How now, Patroclus?</p>
<p>ACHILLES Good morrow, Ajax.</p>
<p>AJAX Ha?</p>
<p>ACHILLES Good morrow.</p>
<p>AJAX Ay, and good next day too.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>ACHILLES What mean these fellows? Know 1422 they not Achilles?</p>
<p>PATROCLUS They pass by strangely: they were used 1423 to bend</p>
<p>To send their smiles before them to Achilles,</p>
<p>To come as humbly as they used to creep</p>
<p>To holy altars.</p>
<p>ACHILLES What, am I poor 1424 of late?</p>
<p>’Tis certain, greatness, once fall’n out with fortune,</p>
<p>Must fall out with men too: what the declined 1425 is</p>
<p>He shall as soon read in the eyes of others</p>
<p>As feel in his own fall, for men, like butterflies,</p>
<p>Show not their mealy 1426 wings but 1427 to the summer,</p>
<p>And not a man, for being simply man,</p>
<p>Hath any honour, but honoured for those honours</p>
<p>That are without him 1428 , as 1429 place 1430 , riches and
favour,</p>
<p>Prizes of accident 1431 as oft as merit,</p>
<p>Which when they 1432 fall, as being slippery standers 1433 ,</p>
<p>The love 1434 that leaned on them as slippery 1435 too,</p>
<p>Doth one pluck down another and together</p>
<p>Die in the fall. But ’tis not so with me;</p>
<p>Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy</p>
<p>At ample point 1436 all that I did possess,</p>
<p>Save 1437 these men’s looks, who do, methinks, find out</p>
<p>Something not worth in me such rich beholding 1438</p>
<p>As they have often given. Here is Ulysses:</p>
<p>I’ll interrupt his reading.— How now Ulysses?</p>
<p>ULYSSES Now, great Thetis’ son!</p>
<p>ACHILLES What are you reading?</p>
<p>ULYSSES A strange fellow here</p>
<p>Writes me 1439 that man, how dearly ever parted 1440 ,</p>
<p>How much in having, or without or in 1441 ,</p>
<p>Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,</p>
<p>Nor feels not what he owes 1442 , but by reflection 1443 ,</p>
<p>As when his virtues shining upon others</p>
<p>Heat them and they retort 1444 that heat again</p>
<p>To the first giver.</p>
<p>ACHILLES This is not strange, Ulysses.</p>
<p>The beauty that is borne here in the face</p>
<p>The bearer knows not, but 1445 commends itself</p>
<p>Not going from itself, but eye to eye opposed</p>
<p>Salutes each other with each other’s form 1446 .</p>
<p>For speculation 1447 turns not to itself</p>
<p>Till it hath travelled 1448 and is mirrored there</p>
<p>Where it may see itself. This is not strange 1449 at all.</p>
<p>ULYSSES I do not strain it at the position 1450 —</p>
<p>It is familiar — but at the author’s drift 1451 ,</p>
<p>Who in his circumstance 1452 expressly proves</p>
<p>That no man is the lord of anything —</p>
<p>Though in and of him there is much consisting 1453 —</p>
<p>Till he communicate his parts 1454 to others,</p>
<p>Nor doth he of himself know them for aught 1455</p>
<p>Till he behold them formed in th’applause</p>
<p>Where they are extended 1456 , who 1457 , like an arch 1458 ,
reverb’rate</p>
<p>The voice 1459 again, or, like a gate of steel</p>
<p>Fronting 1460 the sun, receives and renders 1461 back</p>
<p>His figure 1462 and his heat. I was much wrapt in 1463 this,</p>
<p>And apprehended 1464 here immediately</p>
<p>The unknown 1465 Ajax.</p>
<p>Heavens, what a man is there! A very horse 1466 ,</p>
<p>That has he knows not what 1467 . Nature, what things there are</p>
<p>Most abject in regard and dear in use 1468 !</p>
<p>What things again 1469 most dear in the esteem</p>
<p>And poor in worth! Now shall we see tomorrow —</p>
<p>An act that very chance doth throw upon him —</p>
<p>Ajax renowned! O heavens, what some men do,</p>
<p>While some men leave to do 1470 !</p>
<p>How some men creep in skittish fortune’s hall 1471 ,</p>
<p>Whiles others play the idiots 1472 in her eyes!</p>
<p>How one man eats into another’s pride 1473 ,</p>
<p>While pride is fasting in his wantonness 1474 !</p>
<p>To see these Grecian lords! Why, even already</p>
<p>They clap the lubber 1475 Ajax on the shoulder,</p>
<p>As if his foot were on brave Hector’s breast</p>
<p>And great Troy shrinking 1476 .</p>
<p>ACHILLES I do believe it, for they passed by me</p>
<p>As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me</p>
<p>Good word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?</p>
<p>ULYSSES Time hath, my lord, a wallet 1477 at his back,</p>
<p>Wherein he puts alms 1478 for oblivion 1479 ,</p>
<p>A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:</p>
<p>Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devoured</p>
<p>As fast as they are made, forgot as soon</p>
<p>As done: perseverance, dear my lord,</p>
<p>Keeps honour bright: to have done 1480 is to hang</p>
<p>Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail 1481</p>
<p>In monumental mock’ry 1482 . Take the instant 1483 way,</p>
<p>For honour travels in a strait 1484 so narrow</p>
<p>Where one but goes abreast 1485 . Keep then the path 1486 ,</p>
<p>For emulation 1487 hath a thousand sons</p>
<p>That one by one pursue: if you give way,</p>
<p>Or hedge aside 1488 from the direct forthright 1489 ,</p>
<p>Like to an entered 1490 tide they all rush by</p>
<p>And leave you hindmost 1491 ,</p>
<p>Or like a gallant horse fall’n in first rank 1492 ,</p>
<p>Lie there for pavement to the abject rear 1493 ,</p>
<p>O’er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,</p>
<p>Though less than yours in past, must o’ertop yours,</p>
<p>For time is like a fashionable host</p>
<p>That slightly 1494 shakes his parting guest by th’hand,</p>
<p>And with his arms outstretched as he would fly 1495 ,</p>
<p>Grasps in 1496 the comer. The welcome ever 1497 smiles,</p>
<p>And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek</p>
<p>Remuneration 1498 for the thing it was.</p>
<p>For beauty, wit,</p>
<p>High birth, vigour of bone 1499 , desert in service 1500 ,</p>
<p>Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all</p>
<p>To envious and calumniating 1501 time.</p>
<p>One touch of nature 1502 makes the whole world kin 1503 ,</p>
<p>That all with one consent 1504 praise new-born gawds 1505 ,</p>
<p>Though they are made and moulded of things past,</p>
<p>And give to dust that is a little gilt 1506</p>
<p>More laud 1507 than gilt o’er-dusted 1508 .</p>
<p>The present eye praises the present object 1509 .</p>
<p>Then marvel not, thou great and complete 1510 man,</p>
<p>That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;</p>
<p>Since things in motion begin to catch the eye</p>
<p>Than what not stirs. The cry went out on thee 1511 ,</p>
<p>And still it might, and yet it may again,</p>
<p>If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive</p>
<p>And case 1512 thy reputation in thy tent;</p>
<p>Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late 1513 ,</p>
<p>Made emulous missions 1514 ’mongst the gods themselves</p>
<p>And drave 1515 great Mars to faction 1516 .</p>
<p>ACHILLES Of this my privacy</p>
<p>I have strong reasons.</p>
<p>ULYSSES But gainst your privacy</p>
<p>The reasons are more potent and heroical:</p>
<p>’Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love</p>
<p>With one of Priam’s daughters 1517 .</p>
<p>ACHILLES Ha? Known?</p>
<p>ULYSSES Is that a wonder?</p>
<p>The providence 1518 that’s in a watchful state</p>
<p>Knows almost every grain of Pluto 1519 ’s gold,</p>
<p>Finds bottom in th’uncomprehensive deeps 1520 ,</p>
<p>Keeps place 1521 with thought, and almost, like the gods,</p>
<p>Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles 1522 .</p>
<p>There is a mystery 1523 — with whom relation</p>
<p>Durst never meddle 1524 — in the soul of state 1525 ;</p>
<p>Which hath an operation 1526 more divine</p>
<p>Than breath or pen can give expressure 1527 to:</p>
<p>All the commerce 1528 that you have had with Troy</p>
<p>As perfectly is ours as yours 1529 , my lord,</p>
<p>And better would it fit 1530 Achilles much</p>
<p>To throw down Hector than Polyxena 1531 .</p>
<p>But it must grieve young Pyrrhus 1532 now at home,</p>
<p>When fame shall in our island sound her trump 1533 ,</p>
<p>And all the Greekish girls 1534 shall tripping 1535 sing,</p>
<p>’Great Hector’s sister did Achilles win,</p>
<p>But our great Ajax bravely beat down him 1536 .’</p>
<p>Farewell, my lord: I as your lover 1537 speak;</p>
<p>The fool slides o’er the ice that you should break 1538 .</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>PATROCLUS To this effect, Achilles, have I moved 1539 you:</p>
<p>A woman impudent 1540 and mannish grown</p>
<p>Is not more loathed than an effeminate man</p>
<p>In time of action. I stand condemned for this;</p>
<p>They think my little stomach to 1541 the war</p>
<p>And your great love to me restrains you thus:</p>
<p>Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton 1542 Cupid</p>
<p>Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold 1543 ,</p>
<p>And, like a dew-drop from the lion’s mane,</p>
<p>Be shook to airy air.</p>
<p>ACHILLES Shall Ajax fight with Hector?</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him 1544 .</p>
<p>ACHILLES I see my reputation is at stake,</p>
<p>My fame 1545 is shrewdly gored 1546 .</p>
<p>PATROCLUS O, then, beware:</p>
<p>Those wounds heal ill 1547 that men do give themselves.</p>
<p>Omission to do what is necessary</p>
<p>Seals a commission to a blank of danger 1548 ,</p>
<p>And danger, like an ague 1549 , subtly taints 1550</p>
<p>Even then when we sit idly in the sun.</p>
<p>ACHILLES Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:</p>
<p>I’ll send the fool to Ajax and desire him</p>
<p>T’invite the Trojan lords after the combat</p>
<p>To see us here unarmed. I have a woman’s longing 1551 ,</p>
<p>An appetite that I am sick withal 1552 ,</p>
<p>To see great Hector in his weeds 1553 of peace,</p>
<p>Enter Thersites</p>
<p>To talk with him and to behold his visage,</p>
<p>Even to my full of view 1554 .— A labour saved!</p>
<p>Sees Thersites</p>
<p>THERSITES A wonder!</p>
<p>ACHILLES What?</p>
<p>THERSITES Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself 1555
.</p>
<p>ACHILLES How so?</p>
<p>THERSITES He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector, and is so
prophetically proud 1556 of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in
saying nothing 1557 .</p>
<p>ACHILLES How can that be?</p>
<p>THERSITES Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock 1558 , a stride
and a stand 1559 : ruminates like an hostess 1560 that hath no
arithmetic 1561 but her brain to set down her reckoning 1562 : bites his
lip with a politic regard 1563 , as 1564 who should say ‘There were wit
in this head, an ’twould out 1565’; and so there is, but it lies as
coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not show without knocking
1566 . The man’s undone 1567 for ever; for if Hector break not his neck
i’th’combat, he’ll break’t himself in vainglory. He knows 1568 not me: I
said, ‘Good morrow, Ajax’; and he replies, ‘Thanks, Agamemnon.’ What
think you of this man that takes me for the general? He’s grown a very
land-fish 1569 , language-less, a monster. A plague of opinion 1570 ! A
man may wear it on both sides, like a leather jerkin 1571 .</p>
<p>ACHILLES Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.</p>
<p>THERSITES Who, I? Why, he’ll answer nobody. He professes not 1572
answering: speaking is for beggars, he wears his tongue in’s arms 1573 .
I will put on 1574 his presence 1575 ; let Patroclus make his demands
1576 to me, you shall see the pageant of Ajax.</p>
<p>ACHILLES To him 1577 , Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the
valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarmed to my
tent, and to procure safe conduct for his person of the magnanimous and
most illustrious six-or-seven-times honoured captain-general of the
Grecian army, Agamemnon, et cetera. Do this.</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Jove bless great Ajax!</p>
<p>THERSITES Hum! 1578</p>
<p>PATROCLUS I come from the worthy Achilles—</p>
<p>THERSITES Ha!</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his
tent—</p>
<p>THERSITES Hum!</p>
<p>PATROCLUS And to procure safe conduct from Agamemnon.</p>
<p>THERSITES Agamemnon?</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Ay, my lord.</p>
<p>THERSITES Ha?</p>
<p>PATROCLUS What say you to’t?</p>
<p>THERSITES God buy you 1579 , with all my heart.</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Your answer, sir.</p>
<p>THERSITES If tomorrow be a fair day, by eleven o’clock it will go one
way or other: howsoever 1580 , he shall pay for me 1581 ere he has 1582
me.</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Your answer, sir.</p>
<p>THERSITES Fare you well, with all my heart.</p>
<p>ACHILLES Why, but he is not in this tune 1583 , is he?</p>
<p>THERSITES No, but he’s out o’tune thus. What music will be in him
when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know not, but I am sure none,
unless the fiddler 1584 Apollo 1585 get his sinews to make catlings 1586
on 1587 .</p>
<p>ACHILLES Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.</p>
<p>THERSITES Let me carry another to his horse; for that’s the more
capable 1588 creature.</p>
<p>ACHILLES My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirred 1589 ,</p>
<p>And I myself see not the bottom of it.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Achilles and Patroclus ]</p>
<p>THERSITES Would the fountain of your mind were clear again, that I
might water an ass at it! I had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a
valiant 1590 ignorance 1591 .</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
