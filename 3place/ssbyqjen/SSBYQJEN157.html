<h4 id="scene-2running-scene-5">Scene 2／running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter King of Fairies [Oberon ] alone</p>
<p>OBERON I wonder if Titania be awaked;</p>
<p>Then what it was that next came in her eye,</p>
<p>Which she must dote on in extremity 528 .</p>
<p>Enter [Robin ] Puck</p>
<p>Here comes my messenger.— How now, mad spirit?</p>
<p>What night-rule 529 now about this haunted 530 grove?</p>
<p>ROBIN My mistress with a monster is in love.</p>
<p>Near to her close 531 and consecrated bower,</p>
<p>While she was in her dull 532 and sleeping hour,</p>
<p>A crew of patches 533 , rude mechanicals 534 ,</p>
<p>That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,</p>
<p>Were met together to rehearse a play</p>
<p>Intended for great Theseus’ nuptial-day.</p>
<p>The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort 535 ,</p>
<p>Who Pyramus presented in their sport,</p>
<p>Forsook 536 his scene 537 and entered in a brake,</p>
<p>When I did him at this advantage take:</p>
<p>An ass’s noll 538 I fixèd on his head.</p>
<p>Anon his Thisbe must be answerèd,</p>
<p>And forth my mimic 539 comes. When they him spy,</p>
<p>As wild geese that the creeping fowler 540 eye,</p>
<p>Or russet-pated choughs 541 , many in sort 542 ,</p>
<p>Rising and cawing at the gun’s report 543 ,</p>
<p>Sever 544 themselves and madly sweep 545 the sky,</p>
<p>So, at his sight, away his fellows fly.</p>
<p>And at our stamp here o’er and o’er one falls;</p>
<p>He ‘murder’ cries and help from Athens calls.</p>
<p>Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong,</p>
<p>Made senseless things begin to do them wrong.</p>
<p>For briars and thorns at their apparel snatch,</p>
<p>Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders 546 all things catch.</p>
<p>I led them on in this distracted fear,</p>
<p>And left sweet Pyramus translated there:</p>
<p>When in that moment, so it came to pass,</p>
<p>Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.</p>
<p>OBERON This falls out better than I could devise.</p>
<p>But hast thou yet latched 547 the Athenian’s eyes</p>
<p>With the love juice, as I did bid thee do?</p>
<p>ROBIN I took him sleeping — that is finished too —</p>
<p>And the Athenian woman by his side,</p>
<p>That, when he waked, of force 548 she must be eyed.</p>
<p>Enter Demetrius and Hermia</p>
<p>OBERON Stand close 549 . This is the same Athenian.</p>
<p>They stand aside</p>
<p>ROBIN This is the woman, but not this the man.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?</p>
<p>Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.</p>
<p>HERMIA Now I but chide 550 , but I should use 551 thee worse,</p>
<p>For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,</p>
<p>If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,</p>
<p>Being o’er shoes 552 in blood, plunge in the deep,</p>
<p>And kill me too.</p>
<p>The sun was not so true 553 unto the day</p>
<p>As he to me. Would he have stol’n away</p>
<p>From sleeping Hermia? I’ll believe as soon</p>
<p>This whole 554 earth may be bored 555 and that the moon</p>
<p>May through the centre 556 creep, and so displease</p>
<p>Her brother’s 557 noontide with th’Antipodes 558 .</p>
<p>It cannot be but thou hast murdered him,</p>
<p>So should a murderer look, so dead 559 , so grim.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS So should the murdered look, and so should I,</p>
<p>Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:</p>
<p>Yet you, the murderer, looks as bright, as clear,</p>
<p>As yonder Venus 560 in her glimm’ring sphere 561 .</p>
<p>HERMIA What’s this to 562 my Lysander? Where is he?</p>
<p>Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS I’d rather give his carcass to my hounds.</p>
<p>HERMIA Out, dog! Out, cur 563 ! Thou driv’st me past the bounds</p>
<p>Of maiden’s patience. Hast thou slain him, then?</p>
<p>Henceforth be never numbered 564 among men.</p>
<p>O, once 565 tell true, tell true even for my sake!</p>
<p>Durst 566 thou a 567 looked upon him being awake?</p>
<p>And hast thou killed him sleeping? O brave touch 568 !</p>
<p>Could not a worm 569 , an adder, do so much?</p>
<p>An adder did it, for with doubler 570 tongue</p>
<p>Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS You spend 571 your passion 572 on a misprised mood 573
.</p>
<p>I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood,</p>
<p>Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.</p>
<p>HERMIA I pray thee tell me then that he is well.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS An if I could, what should I get therefor 574 ?</p>
<p>HERMIA A privilege never to see me more;</p>
<p>And from thy hated presence part I so:</p>
<p>See me no more, whether he be dead or no.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS There is no following her in this fierce vein 575 :</p>
<p>Here therefore for a while I will remain.</p>
<p>So sorrow’s heaviness doth heavier 576 grow</p>
<p>For 577 debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe 578 ,</p>
<p>Which now in some slight measure it will pay,</p>
<p>If for his tender 579 here I make some stay 580 .</p>
<p>[Demetrius ] lies down [and sleeps ]</p>
<p>OBERON What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite 581</p>
<p>And laid the love juice on some true love’s sight:</p>
<p>Of thy misprision 582 must perforce ensue</p>
<p>Some true love turned, and not a false turned true.</p>
<p>ROBIN Then fate o’errules, that, one man holding troth 583 ,</p>
<p>A million fail, confounding 584 oath on 585 oath.</p>
<p>OBERON About the wood go swifter than the wind,</p>
<p>And Helena of Athens look 586 thou find.</p>
<p>All fancy-sick 587 she is and pale of cheer 588 ,</p>
<p>With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear 589 .</p>
<p>By some illusion 590 see thou bring her here.</p>
<p>I’ll charm his eyes against 591 she doth appear.</p>
<p>ROBIN I go, I go, look how I go,</p>
<p>Swifter than arrow from the Tartar’s bow 592 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>OBERON Flower of this purple dye,</p>
<p>Squeezes juice on Demetrius’ eyes</p>
<p>Hit with Cupid’s archery,</p>
<p>Sink in apple 593 of his eye.</p>
<p>When his love he doth espy,</p>
<p>Let her shine as glor’ously</p>
<p>As the Venus of the sky.</p>
<p>When thou wak’st, if she be by,</p>
<p>Beg of her for remedy 594 .</p>
<p>Enter [Robin ] Puck</p>
<p>ROBIN Captain of our fairy band,</p>
<p>Helena is here at hand,</p>
<p>And the youth, mistook by me,</p>
<p>Pleading for a lover’s fee 595 .</p>
<p>Shall we their fond pageant 596 see?</p>
<p>Lord, what fools these mortals be!</p>
<p>OBERON Stand aside: the noise they make</p>
<p>Will cause Demetrius to awake.</p>
<p>They stand aside</p>
<p>ROBIN Then will two at once woo one,</p>
<p>That must needs be sport alone 597 .</p>
<p>And those things do best please me</p>
<p>That befall preposterously 598 .</p>
<p>Enter Lysander [following ] Helena</p>
<p>LYSANDER Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?</p>
<p>Scorn and derision never come in tears:</p>
<p>Look when 599 I vow, I weep; and vows so born,</p>
<p>In their nativity 600 all truth appears.</p>
<p>How can these things in me seem scorn to you,</p>
<p>Bearing the badge 601 of faith to prove them true?</p>
<p>HELENA You do advance 602 your cunning more and more.</p>
<p>When truth kills truth 603 , O devilish-holy fray 604 !</p>
<p>These vows are Hermia’s. Will you give her o’er 605 ?</p>
<p>Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh.</p>
<p>Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,</p>
<p>Will even weigh, and both as light as tales 606 .</p>
<p>LYSANDER I had no judgement when to her I swore.</p>
<p>HELENA Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o’er.</p>
<p>LYSANDER Demetrius loves her, and he you 607 .</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!</p>
<p>Awakes</p>
<p>To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?</p>
<p>Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe 608 in show 609</p>
<p>Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!</p>
<p>That pure congealèd white 610 , high Taurus 611 ’ snow,</p>
<p>Fanned with the eastern wind, turns to a crow 612</p>
<p>When thou hold’st up thy hand. O, let me kiss</p>
<p>This princess of pure white, this seal 613 of bliss!</p>
<p>HELENA O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent 614</p>
<p>To set against 615 me for your merriment:</p>
<p>If you were civil and knew courtesy,</p>
<p>You would not do me thus much injury 616 .</p>
<p>Can you not hate me, as I know you do,</p>
<p>But you must join in souls 617 to mock me too?</p>
<p>If you were men, as men you are in show,</p>
<p>You would not use a gentle 618 lady so;</p>
<p>To vow, and swear, and superpraise 619 my parts 620 ,</p>
<p>When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.</p>
<p>You both are rivals and love Hermia;</p>
<p>And now both rivals to mock Helena.</p>
<p>A trim 621 exploit, a manly enterprise,</p>
<p>To conjure tears up in a poor maid’s eyes</p>
<p>With your derision; none of noble sort</p>
<p>Would so offend a virgin and extort 622</p>
<p>A poor soul’s patience, all to make you sport.</p>
<p>LYSANDER You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so,</p>
<p>For you love Hermia; this you know I know;</p>
<p>And here, with all good will, with all my heart,</p>
<p>In Hermia’s love I yield you up my part;</p>
<p>And yours of Helena to me bequeath,</p>
<p>Whom I do love and will do till my death.</p>
<p>HELENA Never did mockers waste more idle breath.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Lysander, keep thy Hermia, I will none 623 :</p>
<p>If e’er I loved her, all that love is gone.</p>
<p>My heart to her but as guestwise sojourned 624 ,</p>
<p>And now to Helen is it home returned,</p>
<p>There to remain.</p>
<p>LYSANDER Helen, it is not so.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,</p>
<p>Lest to thy peril thou abide 625 it dear 626 .</p>
<p>Look where thy love comes, yonder is thy dear.</p>
<p>Enter Hermia</p>
<p>HERMIA Dark night, that from the eye his 627 function takes,</p>
<p>The ear more quick of apprehension 628 makes,</p>
<p>Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,</p>
<p>It pays the hearing double recompense.</p>
<p>Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found,</p>
<p>Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.</p>
<p>But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?</p>
<p>LYSANDER Why should he stay whom love doth press 629 to go?</p>
<p>HERMIA What love could press Lysander from my side?</p>
<p>LYSANDER Lysander’s love, that would not let him bide 630 —</p>
<p>Fair Helena, who more engilds 631 the night</p>
<p>Than all yon 632 fiery oes 633 and eyes of light.—</p>
<p>Why seek’st thou me? Could not this make thee know,</p>
<p>To Hermia</p>
<p>The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?</p>
<p>HERMIA You speak not as you think; it cannot be.</p>
<p>HELENA Lo, she is one of this confed’racy 634 !</p>
<p>Now I perceive they have conjoined all three</p>
<p>To fashion 635 this false sport in spite 636 of me.</p>
<p>Injurious 637 Hermia, most ungrateful maid,</p>
<p>Have you conspired, have you with these contrived</p>
<p>To bait 638 me with this foul derision?</p>
<p>Is all the counsel 639 that we two have shared,</p>
<p>The sisters’ vows, the hours that we have spent,</p>
<p>When we have chid 640 the hasty-footed time</p>
<p>For parting us — O, is all forgot?</p>
<p>All schooldays’ friendship, childhood innocence?</p>
<p>We, Hermia, like two artificial 641 gods,</p>
<p>Have with our needles created both one flower,</p>
<p>Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,</p>
<p>Both warbling of one song, both in one key 642 ,</p>
<p>As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,</p>
<p>Had been incorporate 643 . So we grew together</p>
<p>Like 644 to a double cherry, seeming parted,</p>
<p>But yet a union in partition,</p>
<p>Two lovely berries moulded on one stem,</p>
<p>So with two seeming bodies but one heart 645 ,</p>
<p>Two of the first 646 , like coats 647 in heraldry,</p>
<p>Due but to one 648 and crownèd with one crest.</p>
<p>And will you rent 649 our ancient 650 love asunder 651 ,</p>
<p>To join with men in scorning your poor friend?</p>
<p>It is not friendly, ’tis not maidenly.</p>
<p>Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,</p>
<p>Though I alone do feel the injury.</p>
<p>HERMIA I am amazèd at your passionate words.</p>
<p>I scorn you not; it seems that you scorn me.</p>
<p>HELENA Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,</p>
<p>To follow me and praise my eyes and face?</p>
<p>And made your other love, Demetrius,</p>
<p>Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,</p>
<p>To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare 652 ,</p>
<p>Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this</p>
<p>To her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander</p>
<p>Deny your love, so rich within his soul,</p>
<p>And tender 653 me, forsooth, affection,</p>
<p>But by your setting on, by your consent?</p>
<p>What though I be not so in grace 654 as you,</p>
<p>So hung upon with love, so fortunate,</p>
<p>But miserable most, to love unloved?</p>
<p>This you should pity rather than despise.</p>
<p>HERMIA I understand not what you mean by this.</p>
<p>HELENA Ay, do. Persever 655 , counterfeit sad 656 looks,</p>
<p>Make mouths 657 upon me when I turn my back,</p>
<p>Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up 658 :</p>
<p>This sport well carried 659 shall be chronicled.</p>
<p>If you have any pity, grace, or manners,</p>
<p>You would not make me such an argument 660 .</p>
<p>But fare ye well. ’Tis partly my own fault,</p>
<p>Which death or absence soon shall remedy.</p>
<p>LYSANDER Stay, gentle Helena, hear my excuse:</p>
<p>My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!</p>
<p>HELENA O excellent!</p>
<p>HERMIA Sweet, do not scorn her so.</p>
<p>To Lysander</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS If she cannot entreat, I can compel.</p>
<p>To Lysander</p>
<p>LYSANDER Thou canst compel no more than she entreat.</p>
<p>Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.</p>
<p>Helen, I love thee, by my life, I do;</p>
<p>I swear by that which I will lose for thee,</p>
<p>To prove him false that says I love thee not.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS I say I love thee more than he can do.</p>
<p>To Helena</p>
<p>LYSANDER If thou say so, withdraw 661 , and prove it too.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Quick, come!</p>
<p>HERMIA Lysander, whereto 662 tends all this?</p>
<p>She hangs on Lysander</p>
<p>LYSANDER Away, you Ethiope 663 !</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS No, no, sir,</p>
<p>Seem to break loose; take on as 664 you would follow,</p>
<p>But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!</p>
<p>LYSANDER Hang off 665 , thou cat, thou burr 666 ! Vile thing, let
loose 667 ,</p>
<p>Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!</p>
<p>HERMIA Why are you grown so rude 668 ?</p>
<p>What change is this, sweet love?</p>
<p>LYSANDER Thy love? Out 669 , tawny 670 Tartar 671 , out!</p>
<p>Out, loathèd medicine 672 ! O hated potion, hence!</p>
<p>HERMIA Do you not jest?</p>
<p>HELENA Yes, sooth 673 , and so do you.</p>
<p>LYSANDER Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS I would I had your bond, for I perceive</p>
<p>A weak bond 674 holds you; I’ll not trust your word.</p>
<p>LYSANDER What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?</p>
<p>Although I hate her, I’ll not harm her so.</p>
<p>HERMIA What, can you do me greater harm than hate?</p>
<p>Hate me? Wherefore? O me! What news, my love?</p>
<p>Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?</p>
<p>I am as fair now as I was erewhile 675 .</p>
<p>Since night you loved me; yet since night you left me.</p>
<p>Why, then you left me — O, the gods forbid! —</p>
<p>In earnest, shall I say?</p>
<p>LYSANDER Ay, by my life;</p>
<p>And never did desire to see thee more.</p>
<p>Therefore be out of 676 hope, of question, of doubt;</p>
<p>Be certain, nothing truer: ’tis no jest</p>
<p>That I do hate thee and love Helena.</p>
<p>HERMIA O me! You juggler 677 , you canker-blossom 678 ,</p>
<p>To Helena</p>
<p>You thief of love! What, have you come by night</p>
<p>And stolen my love’s heart from him?</p>
<p>HELENA Fine, i’faith!</p>
<p>Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,</p>
<p>No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear</p>
<p>Impatient 679 answers from my gentle tongue?</p>
<p>Fie, fie! You counterfeit, you puppet 680 , you!</p>
<p>HERMIA Puppet? Why so? Ay, that way goes the game.</p>
<p>Now I perceive that she hath made compare</p>
<p>Between our statures, she hath urged 681 her height,</p>
<p>And with her personage 682 , her tall personage,</p>
<p>Her height, forsooth, she hath prevailed with him.</p>
<p>And are you grown so high in his esteem</p>
<p>Because I am so dwarfish and so low?</p>
<p>How low am I, thou painted 683 maypole 684 ? Speak!</p>
<p>How low am I? I am not yet so low</p>
<p>But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.</p>
<p>Attacks her</p>
<p>HELENA I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,</p>
<p>Let her not hurt me; I was never curst 685 ,</p>
<p>I have no gift at all in shrewishness 686 ;</p>
<p>I am a right 687 maid for my cowardice;</p>
<p>Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,</p>
<p>Because she is something lower 688 than myself,</p>
<p>That I can match her.</p>
<p>HERMIA Lower? Hark, again.</p>
<p>HELENA Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.</p>
<p>I evermore 689 did love you, Hermia,</p>
<p>Did ever keep your counsels, never wronged you,</p>
<p>Save that, in love unto Demetrius,</p>
<p>I told him of your stealth 690 unto this wood.</p>
<p>He followed you. For love I followed him.</p>
<p>But he hath chid me hence 691 and threatened me</p>
<p>To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too;</p>
<p>And now, so 692 you will let me quiet go,</p>
<p>To Athens will I bear my folly back</p>
<p>And follow you no further. Let me go.</p>
<p>You see how simple and how fond 693 I am.</p>
<p>HERMIA Why, get you gone: who is’t that hinders you?</p>
<p>HELENA A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.</p>
<p>HERMIA What, with Lysander?</p>
<p>HELENA With Demetrius.</p>
<p>LYSANDER Be not afraid: she shall not harm thee, Helena.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part 694 .</p>
<p>HELENA O, when she’s angry, she is keen 695 and shrewd 696 .</p>
<p>She was a vixen when she went to school,</p>
<p>And though she be but little, she is fierce.</p>
<p>HERMIA ‘Little’ again! Nothing but ‘low’ and ‘little’?</p>
<p>Why will you suffer 697 her to flout me thus?</p>
<p>Let me come to her.</p>
<p>LYSANDER Get you gone, you dwarf,</p>
<p>You minimus 698 , of hind’ring knot-grass 699 made!</p>
<p>You bead, you acorn.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS You are too officious</p>
<p>In her behalf that scorns your services.</p>
<p>Let her alone. Speak not of Helena,</p>
<p>Take not her part. For if thou dost intend</p>
<p>Never so little show of love to her,</p>
<p>Thou shalt abide 700 it.</p>
<p>LYSANDER Now she holds me not.</p>
<p>Now follow, if thou dar’st, to try whose right,</p>
<p>Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Follow? Nay, I’ll go with thee, cheek by jowl 701 .</p>
<p>Exeunt Lysander and Demetrius</p>
<p>HERMIA You, mistress, all this coil 702 is ’long 703 of you.</p>
<p>Nay, go not back.</p>
<p>HELENA I will not trust you, I,</p>
<p>Nor longer stay in your curst company.</p>
<p>Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,</p>
<p>My legs are longer though, to run away.</p>
<p>[Exit Helena, running, followed by Hermia 704 ]</p>
<p>Enter Oberon and [Robin ] Puck [coming forward ]</p>
<p>OBERON This is thy negligence. Still thou mistak’st,</p>
<p>Or else committ’st thy knaveries wilfully.</p>
<p>ROBIN Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.</p>
<p>Did not you tell me I should know the man</p>
<p>By the Athenian garments he hath on?</p>
<p>And so far blameless proves my enterprise,</p>
<p>That I have ’nointed an Athenian’s eyes,</p>
<p>And so far am I glad it so did sort 705 ,</p>
<p>As 706 this their jangling 707 I esteem a sport.</p>
<p>OBERON Thou see’st these lovers seek a place to fight:</p>
<p>Hie 708 therefore, Robin, overcast the night,</p>
<p>The starry welkin 709 cover thou anon</p>
<p>With drooping 710 fog as black as Acheron 711 ,</p>
<p>And lead these testy 712 rivals so astray</p>
<p>As 713 one come not within another’s way.</p>
<p>Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue 714 ,</p>
<p>Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong 715 ;</p>
<p>And sometime rail 716 thou like Demetrius;</p>
<p>And from each other look thou lead them thus,</p>
<p>Till o’er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep</p>
<p>With leaden legs and batty 717 wings doth creep;</p>
<p>Then crush this herb 718 into Lysander’s eye,</p>
<p>Gives herb</p>
<p>Whose liquor 719 hath this virtuous 720 property,</p>
<p>To take from thence all error with his 721 might,</p>
<p>And make his eyeballs roll with wonted 722 sight.</p>
<p>When they next wake, all this derision 723</p>
<p>Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,</p>
<p>And back to Athens shall the lovers wend 724</p>
<p>With league 725 whose date 726 till death shall never end.</p>
<p>Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,</p>
<p>I’ll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;</p>
<p>And then I will her charmèd eye release</p>
<p>From monster’s view, and all things shall be peace.</p>
<p>ROBIN My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,</p>
<p>For night-swift dragons 727 cut 728 the clouds full fast,</p>
<p>And yonder shines Aurora’s harbinger 729 ,</p>
<p>At whose approach, ghosts, wand’ring here and there,</p>
<p>Troop home to churchyards; damnèd spirits all,</p>
<p>That in crossways 730 and floods 731 have burial,</p>
<p>Already to their wormy beds are gone;</p>
<p>For fear lest day should look their shames upon,</p>
<p>They wilfully themselves exile from light</p>
<p>And must for aye 732 consort 733 with black-browed night.</p>
<p>OBERON But we are spirits of another sort:</p>
<p>I with the morning’s love 734 have oft made sport 735 ,</p>
<p>And, like a forester 736 , the groves may tread,</p>
<p>Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red,</p>
<p>Opening on Neptune 737 with fair blessèd beams,</p>
<p>Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding, haste, make no delay:</p>
<p>We may effect this business yet ere day.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>ROBIN Up and down, up and down,</p>
<p>I will lead them up and down.</p>
<p>I am feared in field and town.</p>
<p>Goblin 738 , lead them up and down.</p>
<p>Here comes one.</p>
<p>Enter Lysander</p>
<p>LYSANDER Where art thou, proud Demetrius? Speak thou now.</p>
<p>ROBIN Here, villain, drawn 739 and ready. Where art thou?</p>
<p>Imitating Demetrius</p>
<p>LYSANDER I will be with thee straight 740 .</p>
<p>ROBIN Follow me, then, to plainer 741 ground.</p>
<p>Exit Lysander, following the voice</p>
<p>Enter Demetrius</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Lysander, speak again;</p>
<p>Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?</p>
<p>Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?</p>
<p>ROBIN Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,</p>
<p>Imitating Lysander</p>
<p>Telling the bushes that thou look’st for wars,</p>
<p>And wilt not come? Come, recreant 742 , come, thou child.</p>
<p>I’ll whip thee with a rod. He is defiled</p>
<p>That draws a sword on thee.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Yea, art thou there?</p>
<p>ROBIN Follow my voice. We’ll try 743 no manhood here.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Enter Lysander</p>
<p>LYSANDER He goes before me and still dares me on.</p>
<p>When I come where he calls, then he’s gone.</p>
<p>The villain is much lighter-heeled than I:</p>
<p>I followed fast, but faster he did fly;</p>
<p>That fallen am I in dark uneven way,</p>
<p>And here will rest me. Come, thou gentle day!</p>
<p>Lie down</p>
<p>For if but once thou show me thy grey light,</p>
<p>I’ll find Demetrius and revenge this spite 744 .</p>
<p>He sleeps</p>
<p>Enter Robin and Demetrius, shifting places</p>
<p>ROBIN Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why com’st thou not?</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Abide 745 me, if thou dar’st, for well I wot 746</p>
<p>Thou runn’st before me, shifting every place,</p>
<p>And dar’st not stand, nor look me in the face.</p>
<p>Where art thou now?</p>
<p>ROBIN Come hither. I am here.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Nay then, thou mock’st me. Thou shalt buy 747 this dear</p>
<p>If ever I thy face by daylight see.</p>
<p>Now, go thy way: faintness constraineth 748 me</p>
<p>To measure out my length on this cold bed.</p>
<p>By day’s approach look to be visited.</p>
<p>Lies down and sleeps</p>
<p>Enter Helena</p>
<p>HELENA O weary night, O long and tedious night,</p>
<p>Abate 749 thy hours! Shine comforts from the east,</p>
<p>That I may back to Athens by daylight,</p>
<p>From these that my poor company detest;</p>
<p>And sleep, that sometime shuts up sorrow’s eye,</p>
<p>Steal me awhile from mine own company.</p>
<p>Sleep</p>
<p>ROBIN Yet but three? Come one more,</p>
<p>Two of both kinds make up four.</p>
<p>Here she comes, curst and sad.</p>
<p>Cupid is a knavish lad,</p>
<p>Enter Hermia</p>
<p>Thus to make poor females mad.</p>
<p>HERMIA Never so weary, never so in woe,</p>
<p>Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,</p>
<p>I can no further crawl, no further go;</p>
<p>My legs can keep no pace with my desires.</p>
<p>Here will I rest me till the break of day.</p>
<p>Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!</p>
<p>Lies down and sleeps</p>
<p>ROBIN On the ground</p>
<p>Sleep sound.</p>
<p>I’ll apply</p>
<p>To your eye,</p>
<p>Gentle lover, remedy.</p>
<p>Squeezes the juice on Lysander’s eyes</p>
<p>When thou wak’st,</p>
<p>Thou tak’st</p>
<p>True delight</p>
<p>In the sight</p>
<p>Of thy former lady’s eye,</p>
<p>And the country proverb known,</p>
<p>That every man should take his own,</p>
<p>In your waking shall be shown.</p>
<p>Jack shall have Jill 750 ,</p>
<p>Nought 751 shall go ill,</p>
<p>The man shall have his mare 752 again, and all shall be well.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>They [Lysander, Demetrius, Helena and Hermia ] sleep all the act</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
