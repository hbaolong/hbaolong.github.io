<h4 id="scene-3-running-scene-5">Scene 3 ／ running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter Benedick, alone</p>
<p>BENEDICK Boy!</p>
<p>[Enter Boy ]</p>
<p>BOY Signior?</p>
<p>BENEDICK In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither to me in
the orchard.</p>
<p>BOY I am here already, sir 418 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK I know that, but I would have thee hence and here again.</p>
<p>Exit [Boy ]</p>
<p>I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool
when he dedicates his behaviours to love, will, after he hath laughed at
such shallow follies in others, become the argument 419 of his own scorn
by falling in love: and such a man is Claudio. I have known when there
was no music with him but the drum and the fife 420 421 , and now had he
rather hear the tabor 422 and the pipe 423 . I have known when he would
have walked ten mile afoot 424 to see a good armour, and now will he lie
ten nights awake carving 425 the fashion of a new doublet 426 . He was
wont 427 to speak plain and to the purpose — like an honest man and a
soldier — and now is he turned orthography 428 , his words are a very
fantastical 429 banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so
converted and see with these eyes? I cannot tell: I think not. I will
not be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster 430 , but I’ll take
my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me
such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well: another is wise, yet I am
well: another virtuous, yet I am well: but till all graces 431 be in one
woman, one woman shall not come in my grace 432 . Rich she shall be,
that’s certain: wise, or I’ll none 433 : virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen
434 her: fair, or 435 I’ll never look on her: mild, or come not near me:
noble 436 , or not I for an angel 437 : of good discourse, an excellent
musician, and her hair shall be of what colour it please God. Ha! The
prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.</p>
<p>He hides in the arbour</p>
<p>Enter [Don Pedro ], Leonato, Claudio and [Balthasar ]</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Come, shall we hear this music?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,</p>
<p>As 438 hushed on purpose to grace harmony.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO See you where Benedick hath hid himself?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO O, very well, my lord: the music ended 439 ,</p>
<p>We’ll fit the kid-fox 440 with a pennyworth 441 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Come, Balthasar, we’ll hear that song again.</p>
<p>BALTHASAR O, good my lord, tax 442 not so bad a voice</p>
<p>To slander music any more than once.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO It is the witness still of excellency</p>
<p>To put a strange face on his own perfection 443 .</p>
<p>I pray thee sing, and let me woo 444 no more.</p>
<p>BALTHASAR Because you talk of wooing, I will sing,</p>
<p>Since many a wooer doth commence his suit</p>
<p>To her he thinks not worthy 445 , yet he woos,</p>
<p>Yet will he swear he loves.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Nay, pray thee come,</p>
<p>Or if thou wilt hold longer argument,</p>
<p>Do it in notes.</p>
<p>BALTHASAR Note this before my notes:</p>
<p>There’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Why, these are very crotchets 446 that he speaks:</p>
<p>Note notes, forsooth, and nothing 447 .</p>
<p>Music</p>
<p>BENEDICK Now, divine air 448 ! Now is his soul ravished. Is it not
strange that sheep’s guts 449 should hale 450 souls out of men’s bodies?
Well, a horn 451 for my money, when all’s done.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>BALTHASAR [Sings ] the song</p>
<p>Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,</p>
<p>Men were deceivers ever:</p>
<p>One foot in sea and one on shore,</p>
<p>To one thing constant never.</p>
<p>Then sigh not so, but let them go,</p>
<p>And be you blithe and bonny 452 ,</p>
<p>Converting all your sounds of woe</p>
<p>Into hey nonny, nonny.</p>
<p>Sing no more ditties 453 , sing no moe 454 ,</p>
<p>Of dumps 455 so dull and heavy:</p>
<p>The fraud of men was ever so,</p>
<p>Since summer first was leafy.</p>
<p>Then sigh not so, etc.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO By my troth, a good song.</p>
<p>BALTHASAR And an ill singer, my lord.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Ha, no, no, faith: thou sing’st well enough for a shift 456
.</p>
<p>BENEDICK An 457 he had been a dog that should have howled thus, they
would have hanged him, and I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief. I
had as lief 458 have heard the night-raven 459 , come what plague could
have come after it.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee get us
some excellent music, for tomorrow night we would have it at the Lady
Hero’s chamber window.</p>
<p>BALTHASAR The best I can, my lord.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Do so: farewell.</p>
<p>Exit Balthasar</p>
<p>Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of today, that your
niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO O, ay! Stalk on 460 , the fowl sits.—</p>
<p>Aside to Don Pedro</p>
<p>I did never think that lady would have loved any man.</p>
<p>Aloud</p>
<p>LEONATO No, nor I neither, but most wonderful 461 that she should so
dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in all outward behaviours seemed
ever to abhor.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Is’t possible? Sits the wind in that corner 462 ?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>LEONATO By my troth my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it, but
that she loves him with an enraged affection 463 : it is past the
infinite of thought.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Maybe she doth but counterfeit 464 .</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Faith, like enough.</p>
<p>LEONATO O God! Counterfeit? There was never counterfeit of passion
came so near the life of passion as she discovers 465 it.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Why, what effects of passion shows she?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Bait the hook well, this fish will bite.</p>
<p>Aside to them</p>
<p>LEONATO What effects, my lord? She will sit you 466 —you heard my
daughter tell you how.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO She did indeed.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO How, how, I pray you? You amaze me: I would have thought
her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection.</p>
<p>LEONATO I would have sworn it had, my lord, especially against
Benedick.</p>
<p>BENEDICK I should think this a gull 467 , but that the white-bearded
fellow speaks it: knavery cannot sure hide himself in such
reverence.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CLAUDIO He hath ta’en th’infection — hold it up 468 .</p>
<p>Aside to them</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?</p>
<p>LEONATO No, and swears she never will. That’s her torment.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO ‘Tis true indeed, so your daughter says: ’Shall I,’ says she,
‘that have so oft encountered him with scorn, write to him that I love
him?’</p>
<p>LEONATO This says she now when she is beginning to write to him, for
she’ll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her smock
469 till she have writ a sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest
your daughter told us of.</p>
<p>LEONATO O, when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found
‘Benedick’ and ‘Beatrice’ between the sheet?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO That 470 .</p>
<p>LEONATO O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence 471 , railed
472 at herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she
knew would flout her. ‘I measure him’, says she, ‘by my own spirit, for
I should flout him if he writ to me, yea, though I love him, I
should.’</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her
heart, tears her hair, prays, curses: ‘O sweet Benedick! God give me
patience!’</p>
<p>LEONATO She doth indeed, my daughter says so, and the ecstasy 473
hath so much overborne 474 her that my daughter is sometime afeard she
will do a desperate outrage 475 to herself: it is very true.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she
will not discover it.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO To what end? He would but make a sport of it and torment the
poor lady worse.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO An he should, it were an alms 476 to hang him. She’s an
excellent sweet lady and, out of all suspicion 477 , she is
virtuous.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO And she is exceeding wise.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO In everything, but in loving Benedick.</p>
<p>LEONATO O, my lord, wisdom and blood 478 combating in so tender 479 a
body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry
for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO I would she had bestowed this dotage 480 on me: I would
have daffed 481 all other respects 482 and made her half myself 483 . I
pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say.</p>
<p>LEONATO Were it good, think you?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says she will die if
he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she
will die if he woo her, rather than she will bate 484 one breath of her
accustomed crossness.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO She doth well: if she should make tender of 485 her love,
’tis very possible he’ll scorn it, for the man, as you know all, hath a
contemptible 486 spirit.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO He is a very proper 487 man.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO He hath indeed a good outward happiness 488 .</p>
<p>CLAUDIO ’Fore God 489 , and in my mind, very wise.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.</p>
<p>LEONATO And I take him to be valiant.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO As Hector 490 , I assure you: and in the managing of
quarrels you may see he is wise, for either he avoids them with great
discretion 491 , or undertakes them with a Christian-like fear.</p>
<p>LEONATO If he do fear God, a must necessarily keep peace. If he break
the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO And so will he do, for the man doth fear God, howsoever it
seems not in him by 492 some large 493 jests he will make. Well, I am
sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her
love?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out 494 with good
counsel 495 .</p>
<p>LEONATO Nay, that’s impossible: she may wear her heart out first.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter. Let it
cool the while 496 . I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would
modestly 497 examine himself, to see how much he is unworthy to have so
good a lady.</p>
<p>LEONATO My lord, will you walk? Dinner is ready.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO If he do not dote on her upon 498 this, I will never trust my
expectation.</p>
<p>Aside to them</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Let there be the same net spread for her, and that must
your daughter and her gentlewoman carry 499 . The sport will be when
they hold one an opinion of another’s dotage 500 , and no such matter
501 : that’s the scene that I would see, which will be merely a
dumb-show 502 . Let us send her to call him in to dinner.</p>
<p>Aside to them</p>
<p>Exeunt [Don Pedro, Claudio and Leonato ]</p>
<p>BENEDICK This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne 503 ,
they have the truth of this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
seems her affections have the full bent 504 . Love me? Why, it must be
requited. I hear how I am censured 505 : they say I will bear myself
proudly, if I perceive the love come from her. They say too that she
will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to
marry. I must not seem proud. Happy are they that hear their detractions
506 and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair—’tis a truth,
I can bear them witness, and virtuous — ’tis so, I cannot reprove 507
it, and wise, but for loving me — by my troth, it is no addition to her
wit, nor no great argument 508 of her folly, for I will be horribly in
love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks 509 and remnants of wit
broken 510 on me because I have railed so long against marriage. But
doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he
cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences 511 and these paper
bullets of the brain 512 awe 513 a man from the career of his humour 514
? No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I
did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By
this day, she’s a fair lady! I do spy some marks of love in her.</p>
<p>He comes forward</p>
<p>Enter Beatrice</p>
<p>BEATRICE Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains 515 .</p>
<p>BEATRICE I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to
thank me: if it had been painful, I would not have come.</p>
<p>BENEDICK You take pleasure then in the message?</p>
<p>BEATRICE Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife’s point and
choke 516 a daw 517 withal 518 . You have no stomach 519 , signior, fare
you well.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>BENEDICK Ha! ‘Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner’
— there’s a double meaning in that. ‘I took no more pains for those
thanks than you took pains to thank me’—that’s as much as to say, ‘Any
pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks.’ If I do not take pity
of her, I am a villain: if I do not love her, I am a Jew 520 . I will go
get her picture 521 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
