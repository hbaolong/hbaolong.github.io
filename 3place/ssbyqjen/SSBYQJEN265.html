<h4 id="introduction-to">Introduction to</h4>
<p>Twelfth Night, or What You Will</p>
<p>‘What is love?’ asks Feste the clown in one of his songs. It is a
very old question. One of the most influential answers to it comes from
ancient Greece in the imaginary voice of the comic dramatist
Aristophanes in Plato’s dialogue the Symposium . Love, says
Aristophanes, is a quest, a journey in search of our lost other
half.</p>
<p>The idea is explained by way of a story about human origins.
Originally there were not two sexes but three – male, female and a
mixture of the two called androgynous. Furthermore, the original humans
were round, with four hands, four feet and two faces. Humankind then
began to have presumptuous ambitions. We rose up against the Olympian
gods. Zeus therefore decided to weaken us by cutting us in two, ‘like an
apple halved for pickling’. So now we have two legs, two arms, one face
and the sensation that we are only half ourselves. We yearn and wander,
hoping that one day we will find the other half that is literally our
soul-mate. If the original whole of which you are a half was male, your
desire will be for another male (as seems to be the case with Antonio in
this play – and Orsino when he falls for ‘Cesario’?); if female, another
female (Olivia desiring the disguised Viola?). These two orientations
are what we now call homosexual.</p>
<p>Only if your original was androgynous will you be drawn to the
opposite sex, as Viola is to Orsino – and Sir Toby, who has the play’s
largest role, to Maria. When one of us meets his or her other half, ‘the
actual half of himself’, then, the Symposium explains, ‘the pair are
lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy, and one will
not wish to be out of the other’s sight even for a moment: these are the
people who pass their whole lives together, and yet they could not
explain what they desire of one another’.</p>
<p>A myth of this kind is a piece of storytelling that answers to a
profound and enduring human belief: that we are somehow incomplete
without love, without a partner. And that in an ideal world we would all
have exactly the right partner. We know viscerally that desire and
reproduction are forever bound to conjunction and splitting: two people
join as one in the act of love; we are made out of a mixture of X and Y
chromosomes, of male seed and female egg, of two distinct genetic
lines.</p>
<p>If love is a quest for an idealized version of our own selves, it is
easy to understand our fascination with twins. They seem to be the
living embodiment of the single self split in two; the extreme case of
conjoined twins vividly conjures up the Symposium ‘s tale of the
original human as an unhalved apple. At the same time, a certain anxiety
has always been attached to the phenomenon of twins. In ancient Greece
it was assumed that a woman who bore twins must have been impregnated by
two different men. Some mythical twins represent idealized unity – as
with Castor and Pollux, the ’gemini’ or heavenly twins who symbolize
perfect friendship – but others represent opposition or splitting. A
nymph in Ovid’s Metamorphoses has twins fathered by Apollo, god of music
and light, and Mercury, god of theft and shady dealings; a pair of girl
twins in Spenser’s Faerie Queene respectively embody chastity and
eroticism; in another of Ovid’s poems, the Fasti , a girl called Lara is
raped by Mercury and bears the Lares Compitales, who become guardians of
the crossroads. These twins become symbolic of how the story of our
lives is made of a perpetual sequence of choices, as alternative ways
open before us.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most potent of all narratives about twins are those in
which a brother and sister are separated soon after birth, meet when
they are grown up and fall passionately and unashamedly in love with
each other: Siegmund and Sieglinde, as portrayed in Richard Wagner’s Die
Walküre , might be considered western culture’s highest exemplar of the
motif. Brother–sister incest was sometimes explored in the Renaissance
theatre – most notably in John Ford’s darkly brilliant ‘Tis Pity She’s a
Whore – but Shakespeare steered away from this dangerous matter. His way
of recreating the Symposium ’s originary androgyne was by cross-dressing
Viola as ’Cesario’, the lovely boy-actor with whom both man and woman,
both Orsino and Olivia, fall in love. Puns on ‘woman’s part’ and ‘small
pipe’ (meaning both voice and male sexual organ) leave no doubt that
alluring androgyny is implied here:</p>
<p>For they shall yet belie thy happy years,</p>
<p>That say thou art a man: Diana’s lip</p>
<p>Is not more smooth and rubious, thy small pipe</p>
<p>Is as the maiden’s organ, shrill and sound,</p>
<p>And all is semblative a woman’s part.</p>
<p>William and Anne Shakespeare’s twins, Judith and Hamnet
(alternatively spelled Hamlet), were born in February 1585. Their
father’s fascination with the dramatic possibilities of double selves is
apparent from his early Comedy of Errors , where he adapted a classical
story about separated male twins and mistaken identity, but complicated
it by giving the brothers servants who are also identical twins. Then in
the summer of 1596, the eleven-year-old Hamnet died. Shakespeare had
lost his only son and Judith would be forever bereft of her second self.
Though we should always be wary of inferring authorial autobiography
from the words of fictional characters in a play, there is an
inescapable poignancy to the images of loss in Twelfth Night : when
Feste sings of sad cypress (‘Come away, death’) or Viola alludes to a
funeral monument, it is tempting to think of Shakespeare’s own lost boy.
Olivia mourns a brother, whilst Viola assumes that hers has been
drowned. When she takes a male disguise and ‘becomes’ Cesario, it is as
if she impersonates her own opposite-sex twin: ‘I am all the daughters
of my father’s house / And all the brothers too.’ She herself explains
that the lost Sebastian is the model for her performance of male
behaviour (‘For him I imitate’).</p>
<p>The principal source of Twelfth Night’ s tale of siblings lost and
found, and of a cross-dressed servant sent to woo on behalf of a master
whom she loves herself, was a novella by Barnaby Riche called ‘Apolonius
and Silla’. There the brother and sister who are the originals for Viola
and Sebastian are not twins but ‘the one of them was so like the other
in countenance and favour that there was no man able to discern the one
from the other by their faces, saving by their apparel, the one being a
man, the other a woman’. Critics sometimes express puzzlement that
Shakespeare makes so much of the resemblance between Viola and
Sebastian, given his presumed personal knowledge that boy–girl twins are
not identical. In modern terminology, it is generally accepted that
monozygotic fertilization is always same sex (in fact, recent research
has shown that in certain rare cases of genetic abnormality it is
possible to have boy–girl monozygotic twins). But Riche’s original
premise reveals the absurdity of this criticism of the plot: siblings
don’t even have to be twins to look remarkably alike.</p>
<p>One of the greatest challenges for a writer is to imagine what it
would be like to be a member of the opposite sex. The particular demand
faced by Shakespeare and the boy-actors who played his women’s parts was
to get beyond the age’s conventions of proper female behaviour, which
commended silence and submissiveness. ‘Cesario’ is partly a device to
give Viola an active voice, to enable her to break the shackles of
passivity. But the lovely combination of quick-witted facility, wonder
and vulnerability with which she slots into her impersonation is
something more than a reaction to social convention or codes of
propriety. In terms of the play’s imaginary world, Viola plays Cesario
so effectively because of her prior knowledge and love of Sebastian –
this is what allows the otherwise implausible conceit of Olivia’s
marrying Sebastian in the belief that he is Cesario. In terms of the
play’s creative origin, it is tempting to speculate that the germ was
sown by Shakespeare’s observation of the intuitive understanding between
his twins as they learned to speak and to play together.</p>
<p>Shakespearean comedy often imagines a journey from the secure womb of
the family to a world of shipwreck and isolation, and thence to the bond
of marriage. The characters lose themselves to find themselves. Broken
families are restored in the same instant that new families are
anticipated through the pronouncement of love-vows. The climax of
Twelfth Night is one of the great reunion scenes, as the parted twins
are joined:</p>
<p>ORSINO One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,</p>
<p>A natural perspective, that is and is not!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>ANTONIO How have you made division of yourself?</p>
<p>An apple cleft in two is not more twin</p>
<p>Than these two creatures.</p>
<p>The language is richly suggestive of one made two and two made one,
of the cleft apple from the Symposium’ s myth of origins, and of the
workings of nature combined with the trick of art (a ‘perspective’ was a
distorting glass that created the optical illusion of one picture
appearing as two). In a single action, brother and sister find both each
other and their object of desire.</p>
<p>And yet, the peculiar poignancy of Twelfth Night comes from the sense
that there are many losses even in this moment of wonder. Antonio, who
has been like a brother and even a lover to Sebastian, is left alone.
Malvolio has been humiliated just a little too far. The union of Sir
Toby and Maria leaves Sir Andrew isolated – he was adored once, too, but
we cannot imagine that he will be again. And Feste is there to sing
another sad song of time and change. Above all, Cesario is no more:
Orsino closes the dialogue by addressing Viola by her boy-name one final
time before she assumes her female garb and becomes his ‘fancy’s queen’.
But ‘fancy’s queen’ is the very language of that shallow courtly love
with which Orsino had tried to woo Olivia: the language that Cesario
cast off when (s) he began speaking in his/her own voice. In the closing
moments of the play, Viola does seem to revert to the silence and
passivity of orthodox female behaviour.</p>
<p>What is going through her imaginary heart at this moment? Even as
Sebastian and Orsino are found, Cesario is lost. Could Viola be saying
goodbye to the feigned twin into which she has made herself?</p>
<p>The name Cesario suggests untimely birth – as in ‘Caesarean section’,
a baby ‘from his mother’s womb untimely ripped’ – but the character
undergoes an untimely death. A few months before starting the comedy of
Twelfth Night , Shakespeare completed his deeply meditated tragedy of
Hamlet . There are unfathomable cross-currents at work here: in creating
and destroying Cesario, perhaps Shakespeare too is saying a goodbye. To
his own Hamnet. Viola is diminished when bereaved of her invented second
self. Was this Shakespeare’s delayed response to poor Judith’s
desolation on the loss of her twin?</p>
<p>A more immediate occasion for the play’s meditations on love and
identity seems to have been Shakespeare’s friendly rivalry with Ben
Jonson. Shakespeare had been writing courtship comedies for many years
when Jonson came onto the theatrical scene at the end of the 1590s with
a more hard-edged satirical vein of drama that tapped into the
psychology of ‘humours’ – the idea that aberrant behaviour (which is
readily comic and worthy of satire) could be attributed to an excess of
a particular passion or obsession or to temperamental imbalance (too
much choler or melancholy). Jonson seems to have fallen out with
Shakespeare’s acting company early in the new century. At this time he
wrote a play called The Fountain of Self-Love, or Cynthia’s Revels for
the Children of Her Majesty’s Chapel, the ‘boy-actors’ company that, to
judge from a famous piece of dialogue in Hamlet , was perceived by
Shakespeare and his fellows as something of a threat to their own
prestige. Jonson’s double title was innovative and not a little
pretentious: Shakespeare may well have been mocking it with Twelfth
Night, or What You Will (his only double title). In pricking the bubble
of inflated language, as he habitually does, Feste may be glancing at
Jonson’s verbosity. ‘I might say’‘element’‘, but the word is over-worn’:
‘element’ is a key word in Jonson’s humoral lexicon. And again, in
response to Antonio’s ‘I prithee vent thy folly somewhere else’, Feste
says ‘Vent my folly! He has heard that word of some great man and now
applies it to a fool. Vent my folly!’ Since The Fountain of Self-Love
contains such phrases as ‘vent thy passion’ and ‘vent the Etna of his
fires’, ‘some great man’ might almost be Jonson.</p>
<p>The fountain in Jonson’s play is that of Narcissus, who drowned while
trying to kiss his own reflection. Shakespeare’s Illyria is also a place
of self-love. Malvolio in particular is a Narcissus figure, but there is
also a certain vanity about Orsino as he plays the role of the courtly
lover. Viola, by contrast, is the opposite of a self-lover. She comes
back from drowning and speaks in the voice of the desiring woman whom
Narcissus neglected:</p>
<p>Make me a willow cabin at your gate,</p>
<p>And call upon my soul within the house,</p>
<p>Write loyal cantons of contemnèd love</p>
<p>And sing them loud even in the dead of night,</p>
<p>Hallow your name to the reverberate hills</p>
<p>And make the babbling gossip of the air</p>
<p>Cry out ‘Olivia!’ O, you should not rest</p>
<p>Between the elements of air and earth,</p>
<p>But you should pity me!</p>
<p>As intimated by the ‘reverberate hills’ and the echo effect
’‘’Olivia!’’ – O’, the ‘babbling gossip of the air’ alludes to the
mythological figure of Echo, who pined away as a result of her
unrequited love for Narcissus.</p>
<p>Jonsonian comedy is peopled by narcissists. Twelfth Night responds
with an astonishing exploration of the relationship between knowledge of
self and sympathy for others – which we might call ‘echoing’– in the
composition of human identity. ‘I am not what I am’; ‘Be that thou
know’st thou art’; ‘I swear I am not that I play’; ‘Ourselves we do not
owe’; ‘nothing that is so is so’; ‘You shall from this time be / Your
master’s mistress.’ These paradoxes and promises are the word-music of
Illyria that ‘Gives a very echo to the seat / Where love is
throned.’</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Viola and her twin brother Sebastian have been shipwrecked off
the coast of Illyria. Each believes that the other has been drowned.
Viola disguises herself as a boy and, under the name of Cesario, enters
the service of the duke Orsino. The duke sends Cesario to woo the lady
Olivia on his behalf, but Olivia falls in love with the lovely ‘boy’.
Viola/Cesario, meanwhile, has fallen in love with Orsino. Sebastian is
saved by the sea captain Antonio and he too arrives in Illyria.
Malvolio, Olivia’s steward, disapproves of the other members of her
household – her kinsman Sir Toby Belch, his friend Sir Andrew Aguecheek
and the jester Feste. Led by the ingenuity of Maria, Olivia’s
waiting-woman, these three plot Malvolio’s downfall. Olivia meets
Sebastian and, mistaking him for Cesario, arranges for them to be
secretly married. Further confusion follows upon mistakes as to the
identity of the twins. Orsino is furious at the apparent falseness of
his page, but, with the eventual meeting of the twins, true identities
are revealed and Orsino recognizes his love for Viola.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentages of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Sir Toby Belch (13%/152/10), Viola (13%/121/8), Olivia
(12%/118/6), Feste (12%/104/7), Malvolio (11%/ 87/7), Orsino (9%/59/4),
Sir Andrew (6%/88/8), Maria (6%/59/6), Sebastian (5%/31/5), Fabian
(4%/51/4), Antonio (4%/26/4).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 40% verse, 60% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: 1601: Performed at Middle Temple February 1602; not mentioned
by Meres 1598; alludes to Anthony Sherley’s visit to the Persian Sophy
(1598–1601) and to a map first published in 1599; parodies the motif of
self-love, double title, and use of word ‘element’ in Ben Jonson’s The
Fountain of Self-Love, or Cynthia’s Revels (late 1600/early 1601), while
a character in Jonson’s Poetaster (performed later in 1601) seems to say
that he has been to a performance of Twelfth Night .</p>
<p>SOURCES: Main plot adapted from the story of ‘Apolonius and Silla’ in
Barnaby Riche’s Riche his Farewell to Military Profession (1581), though
the motif of the cross-dressed disguised ‘page’ wooing a lady on behalf
of a master whom she loves herself is derived from a series of Italian
comedies going back to Gl’Ingannati (‘The Deceived’), an extremely bawdy
play performed by ‘The Academy of the Thunderstruck’ in Siena (1537).
The mistaking of twins is bred from Plautus’ Menaechmi by way of
Shakespeare’s own Comedy of Errors . There is no clear source for the
Sir Toby/Malvolio plot.</p>
<p>TEXT: First Folio of 1623 is only early printed text. Probably set
from scribal copy, it is exceptionally free from errors and textual
problems.</p>
