<h4 id="scene-2-162-running-scene-2">Scene 2 162 / running scene 2</h4>
<p>Enter Portia with her waiting woman 163 , Nerissa</p>
<p>PORTIA By my troth 164 , Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this
great world.</p>
<p>NERISSA You would be 165 , sweet madam, if your miseries were in the
same abundance as your good fortunes are, and yet, for aught 166 I see,
they are as sick that surfeit 167 with too much, as they that starve
with nothing; it is no small happiness, therefore, to be seated in the
mean 168 . Superfluity 169 comes sooner by 170 white hairs, but
competency 171 lives longer.</p>
<p>PORTIA Good sentences 172 and well pronounced 173 .</p>
<p>NERISSA They would be better if well followed.</p>
<p>PORTIA If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels
had been churches and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good
divine 174 that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty
what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow mine own
teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood 175 , but a hot temper
176 leaps o’er a cold decree 177 — such a hare is madness the youth, to
skip o’er the meshes 178 of good counsel the cripple; but this reason is
not in fashion 179 to choose me a husband. O me, the word ‘choose!’ I
may neither choose whom I would 180 , nor refuse whom I dislike, so is
the will 181 of a living daughter curbed by the will 182 of a dead
father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse
none?</p>
<p>NERISSA Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death
have good inspirations: therefore the lottery 183 that he hath devised
in these three chests of gold, silver and lead, whereof who 184 chooses
his meaning 185 chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any
rightly 186 but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there
in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already
come?</p>
<p>PORTIA I pray thee overname 187 them, and as thou namest them, I will
describe them, and according to my description level at 188 my
affection.</p>
<p>NERISSA First, there is the Neapolitan 189 prince.</p>
<p>PORTIA Ay, that’s a colt 190 indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of
his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation 191 to his own good
parts 192 that he can shoe him himself. I am much afraid my lady his
mother played false 193 with a smith 194 .</p>
<p>NERISSA Then is there the County 195 Palatine 196 .</p>
<p>PORTIA He doth nothing but frown, as who 197 should say, ‘An 198 you
will not have me, choose 199 .’ He hears merry tales and smiles not. I
fear he will prove 200 the weeping philosopher 201 when he grows old,
being so full of unmannerly 202 sadness 203 in his youth. I had rather
to be married to a death’s-head 204 with a bone in his mouth than to
either of these. God defend me from these two!</p>
<p>NERISSA How 205 say you by 206 the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon 207
?</p>
<p>PORTIA God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth,
I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he! Why, he hath a horse better
than the Neapolitan’s, a better bad 208 habit of frowning than the Count
Palatine. He is every man in no man 209 . If a throstle 210 sing, he
falls straight 211 a capering 212 , he will fence with his own shadow.
If I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands. If he would
despise me, I would forgive him, for if 213 he love me to madness, I
should never requite him.</p>
<p>NERISSA What say 214 you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of
England?</p>
<p>PORTIA You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor
I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come
into the court and swear 215 that I have a poor pennyworth in the 216
English. He is a proper man’s picture 217 , but alas, who can converse
with a dumb show 218 ? How oddly he is suited 219 . I think he bought
his doublet 220 in Italy, his round hose 221 in France, his bonnet 222
in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere.</p>
<p>NERISSA What think you of the other lord, his neighbour?</p>
<p>PORTIA That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed 223
a box of the ear of the Englishman and swore he would pay him again when
he was able. I think the Frenchman became his surety 224 and sealed
under 225 for another 226 .</p>
<p>NERISSA How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony 227 ’s
nephew?</p>
<p>PORTIA Very vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely
in the afternoon when he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse
than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast 228 .
An 229 the worst fall 230 that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift 231
to go without him.</p>
<p>NERISSA If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket,
you should 232 refuse to perform your father’s will, if you should
refuse to accept him.</p>
<p>PORTIA Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass
of Rhenish wine 233 on the contrary 234 casket, for if 235 the devil be
within, and that temptation without 236 , I know he will choose it. I
will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge 237 .</p>
<p>NERISSA You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They
have acquainted me with their determinations 238 , which is indeed to
return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit 239 , unless
you may be won by some other sort 240 than your father’s imposition 241
, depending on the caskets.</p>
<p>PORTIA If I live to be as old as Sibylla 242 , I will die as chaste
as Diana 243 , unless I be obtained by the manner of my father’s will. I
am glad this parcel 244 of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not
one among them but I dote on his very absence, and I wish them a fair
departure.</p>
<p>NERISSA Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time, a Venetian,
a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of
Montferrat 245 ?</p>
<p>PORTIA Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he called.</p>
<p>NERISSA True, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish 246 eyes
looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.</p>
<p>PORTIA I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy
praise.</p>
<p>Enter a Servingman</p>
<p>SERVANT The four strangers 247 seek you, madam, to take their leave.
And there is a forerunner 248 come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco,
who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight.</p>
<p>PORTIA If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can
bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he
have the condition 249 of a saint and the complexion of a devil 250 , I
had rather he should shrive me 251 than wive 252 me. Come, Nerissa.—
Sirrah 253 , go before; whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another
knocks at the door.</p>
<p>To the Servingman</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
