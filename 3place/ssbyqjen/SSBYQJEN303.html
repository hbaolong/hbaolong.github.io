<h4 id="scene-3-running-scene-14">Scene 3 / running scene 14</h4>
<p>Enter Leontes, Polixenes, Florizel, Perdita, Camillo, Paulina, Lords
and Attendants</p>
<p>LEONTES O grave 1561 and good Paulina, the great comfort</p>
<p>That I have had of thee!</p>
<p>PAULINA What 1562 , sovereign sir,</p>
<p>I did not well I meant well. All my services</p>
<p>You have paid home 1563 . But that you have vouchsafed 1564 ,</p>
<p>With your crowned brother and these your contracted 1565</p>
<p>Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,</p>
<p>It is a surplus of your grace, which never</p>
<p>My life may last to answer 1566 .</p>
<p>LEONTES O Paulina,</p>
<p>We honour you with trouble 1567 . But we came</p>
<p>To see the statue of our queen. Your gallery 1568</p>
<p>Have we passed through, not without much content 1569</p>
<p>In many singularities 1570 , but we saw not</p>
<p>That which my daughter came to look upon,</p>
<p>The statue of her mother.</p>
<p>PAULINA As she lived peerless,</p>
<p>So her dead likeness, I do well believe,</p>
<p>Excels whatever yet you looked upon</p>
<p>Or hand of man hath done: therefore I keep it</p>
<p>Lonely 1571 , apart. But here it is. Prepare</p>
<p>To see the life as lively mocked 1572 as ever</p>
<p>Still 1573 sleep mocked death. Behold, and say ’tis well 1574 .</p>
<p>Paulina draws a curtain and reveals Hermione standing like a
statue</p>
<p>I like your silence, it the more shows off</p>
<p>Your wonder. But yet speak. First, you, my liege,</p>
<p>Comes it not something near 1575 ?</p>
<p>LEONTES Her natural posture!</p>
<p>Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed</p>
<p>Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she</p>
<p>In thy not chiding, for she was as tender</p>
<p>As 1576 infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,</p>
<p>Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing</p>
<p>So agèd as this seems.</p>
<p>POLIXENES O, not by much.</p>
<p>PAULINA So much the more our carver’s excellence.</p>
<p>Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her</p>
<p>As she lived now.</p>
<p>LEONTES As now she might have done,</p>
<p>So much to my good comfort, as it is</p>
<p>Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,</p>
<p>Even with such life of majesty, warm life,</p>
<p>As now it coldly stands, when first I wooed her!</p>
<p>I am ashamed. Does not the stone 1577 rebuke me</p>
<p>For being more stone than it? O royal piece,</p>
<p>There’s magic in thy majesty, which has</p>
<p>My evils conjured to remembrance and</p>
<p>From thy admiring 1578 daughter took the spirits 1579 ,</p>
<p>Standing like stone with thee.</p>
<p>PERDITA And give me leave,</p>
<p>And do not say ’tis superstition 1580 , that</p>
<p>I kneel and then implore her blessing.— Lady,</p>
<p>Kneels before the statue</p>
<p>Dear queen, that ended when I but began,</p>
<p>Give me that hand of yours to kiss.</p>
<p>PAULINA O, patience!</p>
<p>Prevents Perdita from touching</p>
<p>The statue is but newly fixed 1581 ; the colour’s not dry.</p>
<p>Perdita stands?</p>
<p>CAMILLO My lord, your sorrow was too sore 1582 laid on,</p>
<p>Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,</p>
<p>So many summers dry 1583 . Scarce any joy</p>
<p>Did ever so long live; no sorrow</p>
<p>But killed itself much sooner.</p>
<p>POLIXENES Dear my brother,</p>
<p>Let him that was the cause 1584 of this have power</p>
<p>To take off so much grief from you as he</p>
<p>Will piece up in 1585 himself.</p>
<p>PAULINA Indeed, my lord,</p>
<p>If I had thought the sight of my poor image</p>
<p>Would thus have wrought 1586 you — for the stone is mine —</p>
<p>I’d not have showed it.</p>
<p>LEONTES Do not draw the curtain.</p>
<p>PAULINA No longer shall you gaze on’t, lest your fancy 1587</p>
<p>May think anon it moves.</p>
<p>LEONTES Let be, let be.</p>
<p>Would I were dead, but that methinks already —</p>
<p>What was he that did make it?— See, my lord,</p>
<p>Would you not deem it breathed? And that those veins</p>
<p>Did verily 1588 bear blood?</p>
<p>POLIXENES Masterly done.</p>
<p>The very life seems warm upon her lip.</p>
<p>LEONTES The fixture 1589 of her eye has motion 1590 in’t,</p>
<p>As we are mocked with art.</p>
<p>PAULINA I’ll draw the curtain.</p>
<p>My lord’s almost so far transported 1591 that</p>
<p>He’ll think anon it lives.</p>
<p>LEONTES O, sweet Paulina,</p>
<p>Make me to think so twenty years together!</p>
<p>No settled senses 1592 of the world can match</p>
<p>The pleasure of that madness. Let’t 1593 alone.</p>
<p>PAULINA I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirred you, but</p>
<p>I could afflict you farther.</p>
<p>LEONTES Do, Paulina,</p>
<p>For this affliction has a taste as sweet</p>
<p>As any cordial 1594 comfort. Still, methinks</p>
<p>There is an air comes from her 1595 . What fine chisel</p>
<p>Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,</p>
<p>For I will kiss her.</p>
<p>PAULINA Good my lord, forbear:</p>
<p>The ruddiness 1596 upon her lip is wet.</p>
<p>You’ll mar 1597 it if you kiss it, stain your own</p>
<p>With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?</p>
<p>LEONTES No, not these twenty years.</p>
<p>PERDITA So long could I</p>
<p>Stand by, a looker-on.</p>
<p>PAULINA Either forbear 1598 ,</p>
<p>Quit presently 1599 the chapel 1600 , or resolve you 1601</p>
<p>For more amazement. If you can behold it,</p>
<p>I’ll make the statue move indeed, descend</p>
<p>And take you by the hand. But then you’ll think —</p>
<p>Which I protest against — I am assisted</p>
<p>By wicked powers 1602 .</p>
<p>LEONTES What you can make her do,</p>
<p>I am content to look on. What to speak,</p>
<p>I am content to hear, for ’tis as easy</p>
<p>To make her speak as move.</p>
<p>PAULINA It is required</p>
<p>You do awake your faith. Then all stand still.</p>
<p>On 1603 : those that think it is unlawful business</p>
<p>I am about, let them depart.</p>
<p>LEONTES Proceed:</p>
<p>No foot shall stir.</p>
<p>PAULINA Music; awake her: strike 1604 !</p>
<p>Music</p>
<p>’Tis time: descend: be stone no more: approach:</p>
<p>To Hermione</p>
<p>Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,</p>
<p>I’ll fill your grave up 1605 . Stir. Nay, come away.</p>
<p>Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him 1606</p>
<p>Dear life redeems you.— You perceive she stirs.</p>
<p>Start not. Her actions shall be holy as</p>
<p>Hermione comes down</p>
<p>You hear my spell is lawful. Do not shun her</p>
<p>Until you see her die again, for then</p>
<p>You kill her double 1607 . Nay, present your hand:</p>
<p>When she was young you wooed her, now in age</p>
<p>Is she become the suitor 1608 ?</p>
<p>LEONTES O, she’s warm!</p>
<p>Touches her</p>
<p>If this be magic, let it be an art</p>
<p>Lawful as eating.</p>
<p>POLIXENES She embraces him.</p>
<p>CAMILLO She hangs about his neck.</p>
<p>If she pertain to life 1609 let her speak too.</p>
<p>POLIXENES Ay, and make it manifest 1610 where she has lived,</p>
<p>Or how stol’n from the dead.</p>
<p>PAULINA That she is living,</p>
<p>Were it but told you, should be hooted 1611 at</p>
<p>Like an old tale. But it appears she lives,</p>
<p>Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.—</p>
<p>Please you to interpose, fair madam. Kneel</p>
<p>To Perdita</p>
<p>And pray your mother’s blessing.— Turn, good lady,</p>
<p>To Hermione</p>
<p>Our Perdita is found.</p>
<p>HERMIONE You gods, look down</p>
<p>And from your sacred vials pour your graces</p>
<p>Upon my daughter’s head!— Tell me, mine own.</p>
<p>Where hast thou been preserved 1612 ? Where lived? How found</p>
<p>Thy father’s court? For thou shalt hear that I,</p>
<p>Knowing by Paulina that the oracle</p>
<p>Gave hope thou wast in being 1613 , have preserved</p>
<p>Myself to see the issue 1614 .</p>
<p>PAULINA There’s time enough for that,</p>
<p>Lest they desire upon this push to trouble</p>
<p>Your joys with like relation 1615 . Go together,</p>
<p>You precious winners all. Your exultation</p>
<p>Partake 1616 to every one. I, an old turtle 1617 ,</p>
<p>Will wing me to some withered bough and there</p>
<p>My mate 1618 , that’s never to be found again,</p>
<p>Lament till I am lost 1619 .</p>
<p>LEONTES O, peace, Paulina!</p>
<p>Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,</p>
<p>As I by thine a wife. This is a match 1620 ,</p>
<p>And made between’s 1621 by vows. Thou hast found mine —</p>
<p>But how, is to be questioned, for I saw her,</p>
<p>As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many</p>
<p>A prayer upon her grave. I’ll not seek far —</p>
<p>For 1622 him, I partly know his mind — to find thee</p>
<p>An honourable husband.— Come, Camillo,</p>
<p>And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty</p>
<p>Is richly noted and here justified 1623</p>
<p>By us, a pair of kings.— Let’s from this place.—</p>
<p>What? Look upon my brother.— Both your pardons,</p>
<p>To Hermione, then also Polixenes</p>
<p>That e’er I put between your holy looks</p>
<p>My ill suspicion. This your son-in-law,</p>
<p>And son unto the king, whom, heavens directing,</p>
<p>Is troth-plight 1624 to your daughter.— Good Paulina,</p>
<p>Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely</p>
<p>Each one demand 1625 , and answer to his part</p>
<p>Performed in this wide gap of time since first</p>
<p>We were dissevered 1626 . Hastily, lead away.</p>
