<h4 id="scene-3-running-scene-11">Scene 3 ／ running scene 11</h4>
<p>Enter Rosalind and Celia</p>
<p>ROSALIND How say you now? Is it not past two o’clock? And here much
Orlando 1014 !</p>
<p>CELIA I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath ta’en
his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep.</p>
<p>Enter Silvius</p>
<p>With a letter</p>
<p>Look, who comes here.</p>
<p>SILVIUS My errand is to you, fair youth.</p>
<p>To Rosalind</p>
<p>My gentle Phoebe bid me give you this:</p>
<p>I know not the contents, but — as I guess</p>
<p>By the stern brow and waspish 1015 action</p>
<p>Which she did use 1016 as she was writing of it —</p>
<p>It bears an angry tenor; pardon me,</p>
<p>I am but as a guiltless messenger.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Patience herself would startle at this letter</p>
<p>Reads letter</p>
<p>And play the swaggerer 1017 . Bear this, bear all:</p>
<p>She says I am not fair, that I lack manners.</p>
<p>She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,</p>
<p>Were man as rare as phoenix 1018 . ’Od’s 1019 my will!</p>
<p>Her love is not the hare that I do hunt.</p>
<p>Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,</p>
<p>This is a letter of your own device 1020 .</p>
<p>SILVIUS No, I protest 1021 , I know not the contents.</p>
<p>Phoebe did write it.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Come, come, you are a fool</p>
<p>And turned into the extremity of love.</p>
<p>I saw her hand. She has a leathern 1022 hand,</p>
<p>A freestone-coloured 1023 hand. I verily 1024 did think</p>
<p>That her old gloves were on, but ’twas her hands.</p>
<p>She has a huswife’s 1025 hand, but that’s no matter:</p>
<p>I say she never did invent this letter,</p>
<p>This is a man’s invention 1026 and his hand 1027 .</p>
<p>SILVIUS Sure, it is hers.</p>
<p>ROSALIND Why, ’tis a boisterous 1028 and a cruel style.</p>
<p>A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,</p>
<p>Like Turk to Christian. Women’s gentle brain</p>
<p>Could not drop forth such giant-rude 1029 invention,</p>
<p>Such Ethiope 1030 words, blacker in their effect</p>
<p>Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?</p>
<p>SILVIUS So please you, for I never heard it yet,</p>
<p>Yet heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.</p>
<p>ROSALIND She Phoebes 1031 me. Mark how the tyrant writes:</p>
<p>’Art thou god to shepherd turned,</p>
<p>Read</p>
<p>That a maiden’s heart hath burned?’</p>
<p>Can a woman rail thus?</p>
<p>SILVIUS Call you this railing?</p>
<p>ROSALIND ’Why, thy godhead laid apart 1032 ,</p>
<p>Read</p>
<p>Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?’</p>
<p>Did you ever hear such railing?</p>
<p>’Whiles the eye of man did woo me,</p>
<p>That could do no vengeance 1033 to me.’</p>
<p>Meaning me a beast.</p>
<p>’If the scorn of your bright eyne 1034</p>
<p>Have power to raise such love in mine,</p>
<p>Alack, in me what strange effect</p>
<p>Would they work in mild aspect 1035 !</p>
<p>Whiles you chid me, I did love.</p>
<p>How then might your prayers 1036 move!</p>
<p>He that brings this love to thee</p>
<p>Little knows this love in me;</p>
<p>And by him seal up thy mind 1037 ,</p>
<p>Whether that thy youth and kind 1038</p>
<p>Will the faithful offer take</p>
<p>Of me and all that I can make 1039 ,</p>
<p>Or else by him my love deny,</p>
<p>And then I’ll study how to die.’</p>
<p>SILVIUS Call you this chiding?</p>
<p>CELIA Alas, poor shepherd!</p>
<p>ROSALIND Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument 1040 and play false
strains 1041 upon thee? Not to be endured! Well, go your way to her, for
I see love hath made thee a tame snake 1042 , and say this to her: that
if she love me, I charge her to love thee. If she will not, I will never
have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover, hence, and
not a word, for here comes more company.</p>
<p>Exit Silvius</p>
<p>Enter Oliver</p>
<p>OLIVER Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,</p>
<p>Where in the purlieus 1043 of this forest stands</p>
<p>A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?</p>
<p>CELIA West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom 1044 .</p>
<p>The rank of osiers 1045 by the murmuring stream</p>
<p>Left 1046 on your right hand brings you to the place.</p>
<p>But at this hour the house doth keep itself,</p>
<p>There’s none within.</p>
<p>OLIVER If that an eye may profit by a tongue,</p>
<p>Then should I know you by description,</p>
<p>Such garments and such years: ’The boy is fair,</p>
<p>Of female favour 1047 , and bestows 1048 himself</p>
<p>Like a ripe 1049 sister. The woman low 1050</p>
<p>And browner than her brother.’ Are not you</p>
<p>The owner of the house I did inquire for?</p>
<p>CELIA It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.</p>
<p>OLIVER Orlando doth commend him 1051 to you both,</p>
<p>And to that youth he calls his Rosalind</p>
<p>He sends this bloody napkin 1052 . Are you he?</p>
<p>Shows bloody handkerchief</p>
<p>ROSALIND I am. What must we understand by this?</p>
<p>OLIVER Some of my shame, if you will know of me</p>
<p>What man I am, and how, and why, and where</p>
<p>This handkercher 1053 was stained.</p>
<p>CELIA I pray you tell it.</p>
<p>OLIVER When last the young Orlando parted from you,</p>
<p>He left a promise to return again</p>
<p>Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,</p>
<p>Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy 1054 ,</p>
<p>Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,</p>
<p>And mark what object did present itself:</p>
<p>Und’r an old oak, whose boughs were mossed with age</p>
<p>And high top bald 1055 with dry antiquity,</p>
<p>A wretched ragged man, o’ergrown with hair,</p>
<p>Lay sleeping on his back; about his neck</p>
<p>A green and gilded 1056 snake had wreathed itself,</p>
<p>Who with her head nimble in threats approached</p>
<p>The opening of his mouth. But suddenly,</p>
<p>Seeing Orlando, it unlinked 1057 itself,</p>
<p>And with indented 1058 glides did slip away</p>
<p>Into a bush, under which bush’s shade</p>
<p>A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,</p>
<p>Lay couching 1059 , head on ground, with catlike watch</p>
<p>When that 1060 the sleeping man should stir; for ’tis</p>
<p>The royal disposition of that beast</p>
<p>To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.</p>
<p>This seen, Orlando did approach the man</p>
<p>And found it was his brother, his elder brother.</p>
<p>CELIA O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,</p>
<p>And he did render him 1061 the most unnatural</p>
<p>That lived amongst men.</p>
<p>OLIVER And well he might so do,</p>
<p>For well I know he was unnatural.</p>
<p>ROSALIND But to 1062 Orlando: did he leave him there,</p>
<p>Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?</p>
<p>OLIVER Twice did he turn his back and purposed so,</p>
<p>But kindness 1063 , nobler ever than revenge,</p>
<p>And nature, stronger than his just occasion 1064 ,</p>
<p>Made him give battle to the lioness,</p>
<p>Who quickly fell before him, in which hurtling 1065</p>
<p>From miserable slumber I awaked.</p>
<p>CELIA Are you his brother?</p>
<p>ROSALIND Was’t you he rescued?</p>
<p>CELIA Was’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?</p>
<p>OLIVER ’Twas I, but ’tis not I. I do not shame</p>
<p>To tell you what I was, since my conversion</p>
<p>So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.</p>
<p>ROSALIND But, for 1066 the bloody napkin?</p>
<p>OLIVER By and by.</p>
<p>When from the first to last betwixt us two,</p>
<p>Tears our recountments 1067 had most kindly 1068 bathed,</p>
<p>As how I came into that desert place:</p>
<p>In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,</p>
<p>Who gave me fresh array 1069 and entertainment 1070 ,</p>
<p>Committing me unto my brother’s love,</p>
<p>Who led me instantly unto his cave,</p>
<p>There stripped himself, and here upon his arm</p>
<p>The lioness had torn some flesh away,</p>
<p>Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted</p>
<p>And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.</p>
<p>Brief 1071 , I recovered 1072 him, bound up his wound,</p>
<p>And after some small space 1073 , being strong at heart,</p>
<p>He sent me hither, stranger as I am,</p>
<p>To tell this story, that you might excuse</p>
<p>His broken promise, and to give this napkin,</p>
<p>Dyed in this blood, unto the shepherd youth</p>
<p>That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.</p>
<p>Rosalind faints</p>
<p>CELIA Why, how now, Ganymede? Sweet Ganymede!</p>
<p>OLIVER Many will swoon when they do look on blood.</p>
<p>CELIA There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!</p>
<p>OLIVER Look, he recovers.</p>
<p>ROSALIND I would I were at home.</p>
<p>CELIA We’ll lead you thither.— I pray you, will you take him by the
arm?</p>
<p>They get Rosalind to her feet</p>
<p>OLIVER Be of good cheer, youth. You a man! You lack a man’s
heart.</p>
<p>ROSALIND I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body 1074 would think
this was well counterfeited! I pray you tell your brother how well I
counterfeited. Heigh-ho!</p>
<p>OLIVER This was not counterfeit: there is too great testimony in your
complexion that it was a passion of earnest 1075 .</p>
<p>ROSALIND Counterfeit, I assure you.</p>
<p>OLIVER Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.</p>
<p>ROSALIND So I do. But, i’faith, I should have been a woman by
right.</p>
<p>CELIA Come, you look paler and paler. Pray you draw homewards. Good
sir, go with us.</p>
<p>OLIVER That will I, for I must bear answer back</p>
<p>How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.</p>
<p>ROSALIND I shall devise something: but I pray you commend my
counterfeiting to him. Will you go?</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
