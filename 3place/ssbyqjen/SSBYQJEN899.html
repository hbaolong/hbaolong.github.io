1260</h4>
<p>Enter Katherine Dowager, sick, led between Griffith, her
Gentleman-usher, and Patience, her Woman</p>
<p>GRIFFITH How does your grace?</p>
<p>KATHERINE O Griffith, sick to death:</p>
<p>My legs like loaden 1261 branches, bow to th’earth,</p>
<p>Willing to leave their burden. Reach a chair:</p>
<p>She sits</p>
<p>So now, methinks, I feel a little ease.</p>
<p>Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led’st me,</p>
<p>That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, was dead?</p>
<p>GRIFFITH Yes, madam, but I think your grace,</p>
<p>Out of the pain you suffered, gave no ear to’t.</p>
<p>KATHERINE Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died.</p>
<p>If well, he stepped before me happily 1262</p>
<p>For my example.</p>
<p>GRIFFITH Well, the voice 1263 goes, madam:</p>
<p>For after the stout 1264 Earl Northumberland</p>
<p>Arrested him at York, and brought him forward 1265 ,</p>
<p>As a man sorely tainted 1266 , to his answer 1267 ,</p>
<p>He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill</p>
<p>He could not sit 1268 his mule.</p>
<p>KATHERINE Alas, poor man.</p>
<p>GRIFFITH At last, with easy roads 1269 , he came to Leicester 1270
,</p>
<p>Lodged in the abbey, where the reverend abbot,</p>
<p>With all his convent 1271 , honourably received him,</p>
<p>To whom he gave these words: ’O father abbot,</p>
<p>An old man, broken with the storms of state,</p>
<p>Is come to lay his weary bones among ye:</p>
<p>Give him a little earth 1272 for charity.’</p>
<p>So went to bed, where eagerly 1273 his sickness</p>
<p>Pursued him still: and three nights after this,</p>
<p>About the hour of eight, which he himself</p>
<p>Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,</p>
<p>Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,</p>
<p>He gave his honours to the world again,</p>
<p>His blessèd part 1274 to heaven, and slept in peace.</p>
<p>KATHERINE So may he rest: his faults lie gently on him.</p>
<p>Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak 1275 him,</p>
<p>And yet with charity. He was a man</p>
<p>Of an unbounded stomach 1276 , ever ranking</p>
<p>Himself with princes: one that by suggestion 1277</p>
<p>Tied 1278 all the kingdom. Simony 1279 was fair play:</p>
<p>His own opinion was his law. I’th’presence 1280</p>
<p>He would say untruths, and be ever double 1281</p>
<p>Both in his words and meaning. He was never,</p>
<p>But where he meant to ruin, pitiful 1282 .</p>
<p>His promises were, as he then was, mighty:</p>
<p>But his performance, as he is now, nothing:</p>
<p>Of his own body 1283 he was ill 1284 , and gave</p>
<p>The clergy ill example.</p>
<p>GRIFFITH Noble madam,</p>
<p>Men’s evil manners live in brass, their virtues</p>
<p>We write in water. May it please your highness</p>
<p>To hear me speak his good 1285 now?</p>
<p>KATHERINE Yes, good Griffith,</p>
<p>I were malicious else.</p>
<p>GRIFFITH This cardinal,</p>
<p>Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly</p>
<p>Was fashioned to 1286 much honour. From his cradle</p>
<p>He was a scholar, and a ripe 1287 and good one:</p>
<p>Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:</p>
<p>Lofty 1288 and sour to them that loved him not:</p>
<p>But to those men that sought him, sweet as summer.</p>
<p>And though he were unsatisfied in getting 1289 ,</p>
<p>Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,</p>
<p>He was most princely: ever witness for him</p>
<p>Those twins of learning that he raised in you 1290 ,</p>
<p>Ipswich and Oxford 1291 : one of which fell with him,</p>
<p>Unwilling to outlive the good that did 1292 it:</p>
<p>The other, though unfinished, yet so famous,</p>
<p>So excellent in art 1293 , and still so rising 1294 ,</p>
<p>That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.</p>
<p>His overthrow heaped happiness upon him:</p>
<p>For then, and not till then, he felt himself,</p>
<p>And found the blessedness of being little 1295 .</p>
<p>And, to add greater honours to his age</p>
<p>Than man could give him, he died fearing God.</p>
<p>KATHERINE After my death I wish no other herald,</p>
<p>No other speaker of my living actions,</p>
<p>To keep mine honour from corruption,</p>
<p>But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.</p>
<p>Whom 1296 I most hated living, thou hast made me,</p>
<p>With thy religious 1297 truth and modesty 1298 ,</p>
<p>Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him.</p>
<p>Patience, be near me still, and set me lower 1299 :</p>
<p>To Patience</p>
<p>I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,</p>
<p>Cause the musicians play me that sad note 1300</p>
<p>I named my knell 1301 , whilst I sit meditating</p>
<p>On that celestial harmony 1302 I go to.</p>
<p>Sad and solemn music</p>
<p>She sleeps</p>
<p>GRIFFITH She is asleep: good wench, let’s sit down quiet</p>
<p>For fear we wake her. Softly, gentle Patience.</p>
<p>The Vision</p>
<p>Enter, solemnly tripping 1303 one after another, six personages, clad
in white robes, wearing on their heads garlands of bays 1304 , and
golden vizards 1305 on their faces, branches of bays or palm in their
hands. They first congee 1306 unto her, then dance: and at certain
changes 1307 , the first two hold a spare garland over her head, at
which the other four make reverent curtsies. Then the two that held the
garland deliver the same to the other next two, who observe the same
order in their 1308 changes, and holding the garland over her head.
Which done, they deliver the same garland to the last two, who likewise
observe the same order. At which, as it were by inspiration, she makes
in her sleep signs of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven. And
so, in their dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them. The music
continues</p>
<p>KATHERINE Spirits of peace, where are ye? Are ye all gone,</p>
<p>And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?</p>
<p>GRIFFITH Madam, we are here.</p>
<p>KATHERINE It is not you I call for:</p>
<p>Saw ye none enter since I slept?</p>
<p>GRIFFITH None, madam.</p>
<p>KATHERINE No? Saw you not even now a blessèd troop</p>
<p>Invite me to a banquet, whose bright faces</p>
<p>Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?</p>
<p>They promised me eternal happiness,</p>
<p>And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel</p>
<p>I am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly.</p>
<p>GRIFFITH I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams</p>
<p>Possess your fancy 1309 .</p>
<p>KATHERINE Bid the music leave 1310 ,</p>
<p>They are harsh and heavy 1311 to me.</p>
<p>Music ceases</p>
<p>PATIENCE Do you note</p>
<p>Patience and Griffith speak aside</p>
<p>How much her grace is altered on the sudden?</p>
<p>How long her face is drawn? How pale she looks,</p>
<p>And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!</p>
<p>GRIFFITH She is going, wench: pray, pray.</p>
<p>PATIENCE Heaven comfort her.</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER An’t like 1312 your grace—</p>
<p>KATHERINE You are a saucy 1313 fellow:</p>
<p>Deserve we no more reverence?</p>
<p>GRIFFITH You are to blame,</p>
<p>To the Messenger</p>
<p>Knowing she will not lose 1314 her wonted 1315 greatness,</p>
<p>To use so rude behaviour. Go to, kneel.</p>
<p>MESSENGER I humbly do entreat your highness’ pardon:</p>
<p>My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying 1316</p>
<p>A gentleman sent from the king to see you.</p>
<p>KATHERINE Admit him entrance, Griffith. But this fellow</p>
<p>Let me ne’er see again.</p>
<p>Exit Messenger</p>
<p>Enter Lord Caputius [ushered by Griffith ]</p>
<p>If my sight fail not,</p>
<p>You should be lord ambassador from the emperor 1317 ,</p>
<p>My royal nephew, and your name Caputius.</p>
<p>CAPUTIUS Madam, the same. Your servant.</p>
<p>KATHERINE O my lord,</p>
<p>The times and titles now are altered strangely</p>
<p>With me since first you knew me. But I pray you,</p>
<p>What is your pleasure with me?</p>
<p>CAPUTIUS Noble lady,</p>
<p>First mine own service to your grace: the next,</p>
<p>The king’s request that I would visit you,</p>
<p>Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me</p>
<p>Sends you his princely commendations,</p>
<p>And heartily entreats you take good comfort.</p>
<p>KATHERINE O my good lord, that comfort comes too late,</p>
<p>’Tis like a pardon after execution:</p>
<p>That gentle physic 1318 given in time had 1319 cured me,</p>
<p>But now I am past all comforts here but prayers.</p>
<p>How does his highness?</p>
<p>CAPUTIUS Madam, in good health.</p>
<p>KATHERINE So may he ever do, and ever flourish,</p>
<p>When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name</p>
<p>Banished the kingdom. Patience, is that letter</p>
<p>I caused you write yet sent away?</p>
<p>PATIENCE No, madam.</p>
<p>Gives it to Katherine</p>
<p>KATHERINE Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver</p>
<p>This to my lord the king.</p>
<p>Gives the letter to Caputius</p>
<p>CAPUTIUS Most willing 1320 , madam.</p>
<p>KATHERINE In which I have commended to his goodness</p>
<p>The model 1321 of our chaste loves, his young daughter 1322 —</p>
<p>The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her —</p>
<p>Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding 1323 .</p>
<p>She is young, and of a noble modest nature:</p>
<p>I hope she will deserve well — and a little</p>
<p>To love her for her mother’s sake, that loved him,</p>
<p>Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition</p>
<p>Is that his noble grace would have some pity</p>
<p>Upon my wretched women, that so long</p>
<p>Have followed both my fortunes 1324 faithfully:</p>
<p>Of which there is not one, I dare avow,</p>
<p>And now I should not lie, but will deserve</p>
<p>For virtue and true beauty of the soul,</p>
<p>For honesty 1325 and decent carriage 1326 ,</p>
<p>A right good husband — let him be a noble —</p>
<p>And sure those men are happy 1327 that shall have ’em.</p>
<p>The last is for my men — they are the poorest,</p>
<p>But poverty could never draw ’em from me —</p>
<p>That they may have their wages duly paid ’em,</p>
<p>And something over 1328 to remember me by.</p>
<p>If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life</p>
<p>And able 1329 means, we had not parted thus.</p>
<p>These are the whole contents, and, good my lord,</p>
<p>By that you love the dearest in this world,</p>
<p>As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,</p>
<p>Stand these poor people’s friend, and urge the king</p>
<p>To do me this last right.</p>
<p>CAPUTIUS By heaven, I will,</p>
<p>Or let me lose the fashion 1330 of a man.</p>
<p>KATHERINE I thank you, honest 1331 lord. Remember me</p>
<p>In all humility unto his highness:</p>
<p>Say his long trouble now is passing</p>
<p>Out of this world. Tell him in death I blessed him,</p>
<p>For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,</p>
<p>My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,</p>
<p>You must not leave me yet. I must to bed:</p>
<p>Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,</p>
<p>Let me be used 1332 with honour: strew me over</p>
<p>With maiden flowers 1333 , that all the world may know</p>
<p>I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,</p>
<p>Then lay me forth 1334 : although unqueened, yet like</p>
<p>A queen and daughter to a king inter me.</p>
<p>I can 1335 no more.</p>
<p>Exeunt leading Katherine</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
