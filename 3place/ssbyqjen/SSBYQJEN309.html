The Tragedy of Troilus and Cressida</h4>
<p>Troilus and Cressida perhaps reveals more of Shakespeare’s mature
mind at work than any of the other plays. It is highly intelligent, rich
in rhetorical complexity and linguistic invention, mentally rigorous,
morally sceptical, sexually charged, full of dangerous intellectual and
political energy, markedly unpleasant. Most characteristically of all,
it is impossible to characterize generically.</p>
<p>It was written towards the end of Shakespeare’s great run of
comedies. The cynicism of parts of the near-contemporaneous Measure for
Measure and All’s Well that Ends Well , together with the concern in
those dark comedies with the rough edges of human sexuality, led early
twentiethcentury critics to group them together with Troilus under the
rubric ‘problem plays’. The First Folio prints it between the histories
and the tragedies, which is a fitting place: it is a tragedy in that the
Trojan war, the subject of Homer’s Iliad , was western tragedy’s
foundational theme, but it had been published independently in Quarto
format in 1609 as The Famous History of Troilus and Cresseid , a title
emphasizing a medieval romance accretion to the classical epic tale. A
prefatory epistle in some copies of the Quarto performs a delicate
balancing act, acknowledging that the play is ‘passing full of the palm
comical’, but emphasizing its serious literary content and praising
Shakespeare’s works for being ‘so framed to the life that they serve for
the most common commentaries of all the actions of our lives’.</p>
<p>Despairing of whether to call it history, comedy or tragedy, many
modern critics, with some justification, regard Troilus and Cressida as
a satire. The military plot concerning Achilles, Agamemnon, Ajax, Hector
and the rest is derived primarily from Homer and his descendants, most
notably George Chapman’s 1598 translation of seven books of The Iliad
into elevated English verse. The love plot concerning Troilus and
Cressida, the efforts of Pandarus to bring them together, and the
infidelity of Cressida in the Greek camp, is derived primarily from
Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde . The handling of each plot is equally
cynical. In its love plot the play is an anti-romance, while in its
martial plot it is an anti-epic. In his anti-heroic representation of
the exemplary heroes of the Trojan war, Shakespeare undermines both the
style and the attitudes of Chapman’s recent translation of Homer. The
prologue speaks in high Chapmanesque style of ‘princes orgulous’,
‘crownets regal’, ‘strong immures’ and ‘warlike freightage’, but the
action begins with Troilus saying ‘I’ll unarm again’ and going on to
describe himself as ‘weaker than a woman’s tear … Less valiant than the
virgin in the night.’ The admission of a ‘feminine’language strips all
glamour from the male code of war. But then the code of love is
submitted to a similar pommelling: Pandarus compares the art of love to
breadmaking, with its progression from grinding to bolting to kneading
to leavening to cooling. Troilus idealizes his love in courtly language,
but at the same time compares his desire to a wound, speaking of ’the
open ulcer of my heart’.</p>
<p>Scabs, pus and running sores ooze through the play, while the
foul-mouthed Thersites proves to be the truest commentator on the war.
In the second scene we are given a first account of Hector,
traditionally the most noble of heroes. Here, however, he is reported to
be wrathful, chiding his devoted wife Andromache and striking his
armourer. An honourable man should respect his wife and servants: the
honour of Hector is thus questioned from the start. There is a clear
progression from the reported striking of the armourer to Hector’s
ignominious end, in which he is killed because of an act of vanity: he
has unarmed himself in order to put on the alluring golden armour of a
slain warrior. Our first image of Ajax, another magnificent hero in
Homer, is yet one more debunking. ‘They say he is a very man per se ,
and stands alone’, says Alexander: this sounds like the glorious
self-sufficiency of the epic hero. ‘So do all men, unless they are
drunk, sick, or have no legs’, replies Cressida: ‘stands alone’ is taken
literally and thus reduced to ignobility. And, sure enough, Ajax does
prove to be a singularly unheroic blockhead. As for the great Achilles,
he has withdrawn from the battle and is camping around in his tent with
his gay lover, Patroclus, acting out parodies of the inflated mannerisms
of the other Greek generals. Again and again, Troilus and Cressida
reveals the discrepancy between the polished surface that is projected
by a value system, whether the heroic code or courtly love, and the
tawdry reality beneath. At a philosophical level, the effect of this is
deeply troubling: it is to question whether there can be such a thing as
an absolute moral value.</p>
<p>In a purposeful anachronism during the debate about whether or not
the war is worth fighting, Trojan man of action Hector appeals to the
Greek thinker who was regarded in Shakespeare’s time as the father of
moral philosophy: having begun by commending the argumentative powers of
his brothers Troilus and Paris, Hector adds that they have reasoned
‘superficially, not much / Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought /
Unfit to hear moral philosophy.’ To the modern ear, the language is
typically dense and frustrating. Why can’t Hector say ‘like young men’,
we wonder, instead of ‘not much’ / brief pause for the end of the verse
line /‘Unlike young men’? Trust Shakespeare to prefer ‘not unlike’ to
mere ‘like’. The flow of argument through the play is like a serpentine
river, twisting and turning with double negatives, retractions,
qualifications, hypothetical cases, generalizations exploded by
particular instances. The modern equivalent is the tortured language of
legal opinions and government regulations, which is perhaps why the play
is sometimes considered to have been a showpiece for lawyers. But we
need to remember that rhetoric – the construction of elaborate edifices
of argument that are expounded pro and contra with both words and
sentence structures arranged in highly complex ways – was the absolute
staple of each long day’s work in the Elizabethan grammar school
classroom. Anyone in Shakespeare’s original audience with a few years’
formal education would have had their ears tuned to the mode of speaking
that characterizes the formal debates in the respective council scenes
of the Trojans and Greeks. And for some in the audience who lacked a
formal education –women among them – the theatre was an alternative
classroom, a place to learn the art of manipulating words without the
burden of having to do so in Latin.</p>
<p>Motivating the expansion of the grammar school network in
sixteenth-century England was the educational revolution known to
scholars as ‘humanism’. The purpose of study was not only to achieve a
command of the linguistic arts, but also to be inspired to virtue by the
example of the ancient heroes: to learn integrity from Hector, fortitude
from Andromache, courage from Achilles, leadership from Agamemnon,
strength from Ajax, wisdom from Ulysses, and so forth. It is this moral
dimension that the play systematically strips away. The mythic heroes
are resolutely anti-heroic. The idea that manliness can be proved in
battle is subverted by the voice of Thersites. Thus when Menelaus and
Paris, great rivals in Helen’s love, meet in single combat: ‘The cuckold
and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now, bull! Now, dog!’ Here at it
suggests sexual congress as well as fighting, while ‘bull’ and ‘dog’
reduce the grandeur of the plain of Troy to the baying confines of the
baiting ring (on London’s Bankside, theatre and bear-baiting shared the
same arenas). As Thersites lances the martial values, so the leering
Pandarus reduces love to sex: coming to Troilus and Cressida after they
have spent the night together for the first time, he addresses his niece
as if she were synonymous with her sexual parts, battered and chafed by
the repeated assaults of Troilus’ member (‘How go maidenheads? … Ah,
poor chipochia ! Hast not slept tonight? Would he not – a naughty man –
let it sleep?’). Hector quotes Aristotle as saying that ‘young men’ are
shallow in the art of moral philosophy. The play seems to reply that
young men will be young men: they will squabble and sulk, they will
argue for the sake of it and swear till the air is blue, they thrive on
anger and violence. And old men are no better: they are petulant and
manipulative, prurient and self-interested. As for women, Andromache
makes but a fleeting appearance, Cassandra is no more than the voice of
doom, Helen is not so much the most beautiful woman in the world as one
half of a comic double act with Pandarus, and Cressida knows that her
only means of survival is to use her sexuality.</p>
<p>Moral philosophy is not a fixed point of reference. It is itself
interrogated and found wanting. Hector attempts to distinguish between
the dangers of actions based on emotion (‘the hot passion of distempered
blood’) and the propriety of those based on reason (‘a free
determination /’Twixt right and wrong’). But in the case of the Trojan
war, right and wrong cannot be judged objectively: ‘What’s aught but as
’tis valued?’ asks Troilus. Hector tries to maintain the case that value
exists above ‘particular will’, but the play as a whole – with its
constant counterpointing of Trojan and Greek, battlefield and bedroom,
high rhetoric and low bawdy – proposes that all moral judgements are
relative. It is Ulysses who makes this point most eloquently: a man or
an action can only be judged ‘by reflection, / As when his virtues
shining upon others / Heat them and they retort that heat again / To the
first giver.’ This argument is articulated as part of a cunning scheme
to persuade Achilles to switch back from the role of Patroclus’
effeminate lover to the Greek army’s most masculine warrior: the image
of the bullish Ajax being presented as top soldier will retort on
Achilles and make him strive to regain his military pre-eminence.</p>
<p>Ulysses’ speech about the need for society to maintain a strict
hierarchical order or ‘degree’is part of the same strategy. He argues
that one of the causes of the untuning of degree in the Greek camp is
the fact that their exemplary warrior Achilles is sulking in his tent
when he should be in the appropriate place for an exemplary warrior,
namely on the battlefield. But the method he proposes by which Achilles
is to be restored to his proper place is itself a disruption of degree.
Hector has issued a challenge to single combat. Degree should dictate
that Hector’s equal on the Greek side, Achilles, is put forward but
Ulysses proposes Ajax instead, thus snubbing Achilles and provoking him
into rejoining the army. Ulysses then achieves his end by rigging an
election. Even in the midst of a rhetorically powerful vision of the
chaos that ensues when the moral and social order are not upheld, he
lets slip his knowledge of the relativity of value. In the very act of
warning that ’right and wrong’ will ‘lose their names’ if ‘degree’ is
not observed, Ulysses adds parenthetically that justice resides not
inherently on the side of right, as one would expect it to, but rather
in the ‘endless jar’ between right and wrong. The play as a whole is a
demonstration that order, moral and social, is not a predetermined value
system answerable to a harmonious cosmic design, but rather a process,
an endless debate and negotiation of terms, in which reason and
judgement cannot be separated from appetite and will.</p>
<p>So it is that two kinds of absolute statement are juxtaposed against
each other. On the one hand, aspirations to truth and fixity: ‘True
swains in love shall in the world to come / Approve their truths by
Troilus … As truth’s authentic author to be cited, / ’As true as
Troilus’ shall crown up the verse.’ And on the other, cynical reductions
to the lowest common denominator of the body: ‘Here is such patchery,
such juggling and such knavery! All the argument is a cuckold and a
whore, a good quarrel to draw emulations, factions and bleed to death
upon. Now, the dry serpigo on the subject, and war and lechery confound
all!’ ‘Hector is dead, there is no more to say’: that is how a tragedy
ought to end. But having said that line, Troilus says ‘Stay yet.’
Shakespeare just won’t stop arguing with himself. If there is a victor
in these endless jars, it is the voice of the cynical commentators,
Thersites and Pandarus. The latter gets the last word, addressing the
theatre audience in a broken sonnet that is a symptom of this play’s
fragmented world.</p>
<p>Troilus disintegrates because of the incompatibility between his
mental image of Cressida and what he sees of her in the Greek camp when
she has become Diomedes’ mistress: ‘This is and is not Cressid.’ The
sight causes him to believe that the whole rationality of the world has
collapsed and ‘The bonds of heaven are slipped, dissolved and loosed.’
He has not, however, seen Cressida brutally manhandled and kissed,
treated like a piece of meat, on her arrival in the camp. Shakespeare’s
point in bringing Troilus to ‘madness of discourse’ is not to make a
moral judgement about Cressida – you can’t help feeling that he admires
her improvisational skills and the way in which she maintains linguistic
dignity even as her body is taken by another man – but rather to strip
away the illusion that bodily beauty and strength are signs of inner
grace and greatness. The symbolic figure that comes closest to the
rotten core of the play is that knight in sumptuous armour who is
pursued by Hector. He is so fair without, but what does Hector find
within? A ‘Most putrified core’, a decaying human body.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: For seven years the Greeks and Trojans have been at war
following the Trojan prince Paris’abduction of Helen, the most beautiful
woman in the world, from her Greek husband Menelaus. The besieging Greek
army is encamped under the walls of Troy and, at the point at which the
play begins, the war has reached stalemate. The Greeks are quarrelling
amongst themselves. Achilles, their greatest champion, refuses to fight
and has withdrawn to his tent with his lover, Patroclus. Ulysses tries
to entice Achilles back to the field by arousing his jealously against
Ajax, a rival warrior, whom he acclaims as their new hero and elects to
meet Hector, the Trojan champion, in single combat. Equally at odds with
themselves, the Trojans are debating the value of continuing the war
merely for the sake of keeping Helen. Hector declares her not worth the
lives she costs but when his brother Troilus contends that honour
demands they continue to fight for her, Hector is brought round to his
point of view. Although the single combat between Ajax and Hector ends
in a show of amity, hostilities are resumed the following day. Troilus,
however, is much distracted from these military concerns by his love for
Cressida, the daughter of Calchas, a Trojan who has defected to the
Greek camp whilst leaving his daughter in Troy. The young lovers are
eagerly abetted by Cressida’s uncle Pandarus, who acts as their
go-between. However, after only one night together they are parted when,
in exchange for the captured general Antenor, Cressida is sent to join
her father in the Greek camp. Almost immediately she betrays Troilus
with the Greek Diomedes and, discovering this, Troilus is plunged into
despair. Despite his sister Cassandra’s prophecies of doom, Hector goes
into battle and is treacherously murdered by Achilles, who has finally
been roused into action by the death of Patroclus. With the fall of Troy
certain, Troilus, disillusioned as a lover, assumes Hector’s role as the
Trojan champion and vows revenge on Achilles. The dying, disease-ridden
Pandarus is left to end the play.</p>

<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 70% verse, 30% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: 1601–02. Registered for publication 7 February 1603 (‘as yt is
acted by my lo: Chamberlens Men’). Not mentioned by Meres in 1598;
influenced by Chapman’s Homer translation of the same year. The armed
prologue (Folio only) seems to parody that of Ben Jonson’s Poetaster
(performed summer 1601). There are apparent allusions to the play in
Thomas Lord Cromwell (Chamberlain’s Men, registered for publication in
August 1602) and Thomas Middleton’s The Family of Love (?1602–03).</p>
<p>SOURCES: Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde (perhaps in Speght’s 1598
edition) for the love plot; George Chapman’s translation of seven books
of Homer’s Iliad (1598) and William Caxton’s Recuyell of the Historyes
of Troye (1474, the first printed book in English) for the war. Perhaps
also John Lydgate’s Troy Book (1513) and Robert Henryson’s The Testament
of Cresseid (1532).</p>
<p>TEXT: Quarto, 1609, in two separate states: one with title page The
Historie of Troylus and Cresseida . As it was acted by the Kings
Maiesties seruants at the Globe. Written by William Shakespeare , the
other with title page omitting reference to the stage (The Famous
Historie of Troylus and Cresseid. Excellently expressing the beginning
of their loues, with the conceited wooing of Pandarus Prince of Licia.
Written by William Shakespeare ) and a prefatory epistle that makes
claims for the readerly as opposed to the theatrical text. The nature of
the printer’s copy for both the Quarto and Folio’s The Tragedie of
Troylus and Cressida is fiercely debated by scholars, as is the
relationship between the texts. The original intention of the Folio
editors was to print Troilus after Romeo and Juliet , using the Quarto
as copy text (a few early copies of the Folio survive with a cancelled
last page of Romeo and first page of Troilus ). But printing was broken
off after three pages, perhaps due to a copyright dispute, and Troilus
was eventually squeezed in between the Histories and Tragedies (after
the setting of the ‘Catalogue’ of plays in the Folio’s preliminary
matter). When printing was resumed, a manuscript that had many
differences from the Quarto text was used, though the influence of
Quarto can still be strongly detected. Some scholars suppose that Folio
was printed from an annotated Quarto, but this does not square with the
superiority of many individual Quarto readings: why annotate a sound
reading in a printed text with an alteration that makes less good sense?
It is therefore probable that an independent scribal copy, perhaps based
on the theatre promptbook, and perhaps reflecting playhouse revision,
also lies behind the Folio. In accordance with our editorial policy, we
follow Folio where it is viable, but, in the light of the demonstrable
presence of Quarto in the editing or printing of the Folio, we adopt
Quarto readings where Folio cannot be defended.</p>
<p>On two occasions the text includes passages that seem to be authorial
’first thoughts’intended for deletion. Most modern editors relegate such
lines to an appendix. Our fidelity to Folio means that we have not done
so, though we have indicated the lines in question by enclosing them
within double solidi (// //): they should almost certainly be cut in
performance, but are of great interest in apparently revealing
Shakespeare in the process of composition.</p>

<p>Stir up the sons of Troy.</p>
<p>Now expectation, tickling 20 skittish 21 spirits,</p>
<p>On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,</p>
<p>Sets all on hazard 22 . And hither am I come,</p>
<p>A prologue armed 23 , but not in confidence</p>
<p>Of 24 author’s pen or actor’s voice, but suited</p>
<p>In like conditions as our argument 25 26 ,</p>
<p>To tell you, fair beholders, that our play</p>
<p>Leaps o’er the vaunt and firstlings 27 of those broils 28 ,</p>
<p>Beginning in the middle 29 , starting thence away</p>
<p>To what may be digested 30 in a play.</p>
<p>Like or find fault, do as your pleasures are:</p>
<p>Now good or bad, ’tis but the chance of war.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>Act 1</p>
