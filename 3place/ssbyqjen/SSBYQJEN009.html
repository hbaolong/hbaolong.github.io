<h4 id="scene-1running-scene-3">Scene 1／running scene 3</h4>
<p>Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian, Francisco and
others</p>
<p>GONZALO Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause —</p>
<p>To Alonso</p>
<p>So have we all — of joy, for our escape</p>
<p>Is much beyond 362 our loss. Our hint 363 of woe</p>
<p>Is common: every day some sailor’s wife,</p>
<p>The masters of some merchant 364 , and the merchant</p>
<p>Have just our theme of woe. But for the miracle —</p>
<p>I mean our preservation — few in millions</p>
<p>Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh 365</p>
<p>Our sorrow with our comfort.</p>
<p>ALONSO Prithee, peace 366 .</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN He receives comfort like cold porridge.</p>
<p>Antonio and Sebastian speak apart</p>
<p>ANTONIO The visitor 367 will not give him o’er so.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Look, he’s winding up the watch of his wit 368 : by and by
it will strike.</p>
<p>GONZALO Sir—</p>
<p>To Alonso</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN One: tell 369 .</p>
<p>GONZALO When every grief is entertained 370 that’s offered, comes to
th’entertainer—</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN A dollar 371 .</p>
<p>Aside to Antonio, but overheard by Gonzalo</p>
<p>GONZALO Dolour 372 comes to him, indeed: you have spoken truer than
you purposed 373 .</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN You have taken it wiselier 374 than I meant you should.</p>
<p>GONZALO Therefore, my lord—</p>
<p>To Alonso</p>
<p>ANTONIO Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!</p>
<p>ALONSO I prithee, spare 375 .</p>
<p>To Gonzalo</p>
<p>GONZALO Well, I have done: but yet—</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN He will be talking.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to
crow 376 ?</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN The old cock.</p>
<p>ANTONIO The cockerel 377 .</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Done. The wager 378 ?</p>
<p>ANTONIO A laughter 379 .</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN A match!</p>
<p>ADRIAN Though this island seem to be desert 380 —</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>ANTONIO So: you’re paid 381 .</p>
<p>ADRIAN Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible—</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Yet—</p>
<p>ADRIAN Yet—</p>
<p>ANTONIO He could not miss’t.</p>
<p>ADRIAN It must needs be of subtle 382 , tender and delicate
temperance 383 .</p>
<p>ANTONIO Temperance was a delicate 384 wench.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Ay, and a subtle 385 , as he most learnedly delivered 386
.</p>
<p>ADRIAN The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen 387 .</p>
<p>GONZALO Here is everything advantageous to life.</p>
<p>ANTONIO True: save 388 means to live.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Of that there’s none, or little.</p>
<p>GONZALO How lush and lusty 389 the grass looks. How green!</p>
<p>ANTONIO The ground indeed is tawny 390 .</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN With an eye 391 of green in’t.</p>
<p>ANTONIO He misses not much.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN No: he doth but mistake the truth totally.</p>
<p>GONZALO But the rarity 392 of it is — which is indeed almost beyond
credit 393 —</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN As many vouched 394 rarities are.</p>
<p>GONZALO —That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea,
hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new-dyed
395 than stained with salt water.</p>
<p>ANTONIO If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he
lies?</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Ay, or very falsely pocket up 396 his report.</p>
<p>GONZALO Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on
first in Afric 397 , at the marriage of the king’s fair daughter
Claribel to the King of Tunis 398 .</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN ’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our
return.</p>
<p>ADRIAN Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their
queen.</p>
<p>GONZALO Not since widow Dido’s 399 time.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Widow! A pox o’that! How came that ‘widow’ in 400 ? Widow
Dido!</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN What if he had said ‘widower Aeneas’ 401 too? Good lord,
how you take it!</p>
<p>ADRIAN ‘Widow Dido’, said you? You make me study of 402 that: she was
of Carthage 403 , not of Tunis.</p>
<p>GONZALO This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.</p>
<p>ADRIAN Carthage?</p>
<p>GONZALO I assure you, Carthage.</p>
<p>ANTONIO His word is more than the miraculous harp 404 .</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN He hath raised the wall and houses too.</p>
<p>ANTONIO What impossible matter will he make easy next?</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and
give it his son for an apple.</p>
<p>ANTONIO And, sowing the kernels 405 of it in the sea, bring forth
more islands.</p>
<p>GONZALO Ay.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Why, in good time.</p>
<p>GONZALO Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as
when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now
queen.</p>
<p>To Alonso</p>
<p>ANTONIO And the rarest 406 that e’er came there.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Bate 407 , I beseech you, widow Dido.</p>
<p>ANTONIO O, widow Dido? Ay, widow Dido 408 .</p>
<p>GONZALO Is not, sir, my doublet 409 as fresh as the first day I wore
it? I mean, in a sort 410 —</p>
<p>ANTONIO That sort 411 was well fished for.</p>
<p>GONZALO —When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage.</p>
<p>ALONSO You cram these words into mine ears against</p>
<p>The stomach 412 of my sense 413 . Would I had never</p>
<p>Married my daughter there: for, coming thence,</p>
<p>My son is lost and — in my rate 414 — she too,</p>
<p>Who is so far from Italy removed</p>
<p>I ne’er again shall see her. O thou mine heir</p>
<p>Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish</p>
<p>Hath made his meal on thee?</p>
<p>FRANCISCO Sir, he may live:</p>
<p>I saw him beat the surges 415 under him,</p>
<p>And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,</p>
<p>Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted</p>
<p>The surge most swoll’n that met him: his bold head</p>
<p>’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared 416</p>
<p>Himself with his good arms in lusty 417 stroke</p>
<p>To th’shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis 418 bowed,</p>
<p>As 419 stooping to relieve him: I not doubt</p>
<p>He came alive to land.</p>
<p>ALONSO No, no, he’s gone.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,</p>
<p>To Alonso</p>
<p>That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,</p>
<p>But rather loose 420 her to an African,</p>
<p>Where she, at least, is banished from your eye,</p>
<p>Who 421 hath cause to wet the grief 422 on’t.</p>
<p>ALONSO Prithee, peace.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN You were kneeled to and importuned 423 otherwise</p>
<p>By all of us: and the fair soul herself</p>
<p>Weighed between loathness 424 and obedience at</p>
<p>Which end o’th’beam should bow 425 . We have lost your son,</p>
<p>I fear, forever: Milan and Naples have</p>
<p>More widows in them of this business’ making</p>
<p>Than we bring men to comfort them.</p>
<p>The fault’s your own.</p>
<p>ALONSO So is the dear’st 426 o’th’loss.</p>
<p>GONZALO My lord Sebastian,</p>
<p>The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness,</p>
<p>And time 427 to speak it in: you rub the sore,</p>
<p>When you should bring the plaster.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Very well.</p>
<p>ANTONIO And most chirurgeonly 428 .</p>
<p>GONZALO It is foul weather in us all, good sir,</p>
<p>To Alonso</p>
<p>When you are cloudy.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Foul weather?</p>
<p>ANTONIO Very foul.</p>
<p>GONZALO Had I plantation 429 of this isle, my lord—</p>
<p>ANTONIO He’d sow’t with nettle-seed.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Or docks, or mallows 430 .</p>
<p>GONZALO And were the king on’t, what would I do?</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Scape being drunk for want 431 of wine.</p>
<p>GONZALO I’th’commonwealth I would by contraries</p>
<p>Execute all things 432 : for no kind of traffic 433</p>
<p>Would I admit: no name of magistrate:</p>
<p>Letters 434 should not be known: riches, poverty,</p>
<p>And use of service 435 , none: contract, succession 436 ,</p>
<p>Bourn 437 , bound of land, tilth 438 , vineyard, none:</p>
<p>No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil:</p>
<p>No occupation, all men idle, all:</p>
<p>And women too, but innocent and pure:</p>
<p>No sovereignty.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Yet he would be king on’t.</p>
<p>ANTONIO The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.</p>
<p>GONZALO All things in common 439 nature should produce</p>
<p>Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,</p>
<p>Sword, pike 440 , knife, gun, or need of any engine 441 ,</p>
<p>Would I not have: but nature should bring forth,</p>
<p>Of it own kind, all foison 442 , all abundance,</p>
<p>To feed my innocent people.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN No marrying ’mong his subjects?</p>
<p>ANTONIO None, man, all idle: whores and knaves.</p>
<p>GONZALO I would with such perfection govern, sir,</p>
<p>T’excel the golden age 443 .</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN ’Save his majesty!</p>
<p>ANTONIO Long live Gonzalo!</p>
<p>Bowing or doffing hats</p>
<p>GONZALO And — do you mark 444 me, sir?</p>
<p>ALONSO Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.</p>
<p>GONZALO I do well believe your highness: and did it to minister
occasion 445 to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible 446 and nimble
447 lungs that they always use 448 to laugh at nothing.</p>
<p>ANTONIO ’Twas you we laughed at.</p>
<p>GONZALO Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you: so you
may continue and laugh at nothing still.</p>
<p>ANTONIO What a blow was there given!</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN An it had not fallen flat-long 449 .</p>
<p>GONZALO You are gentlemen of brave metal 450 : you would lift the
moon out of her sphere 451 , if she would continue in it five weeks 452
without changing.</p>
<p>Enter Ariel [invisible ] playing solemn music</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN We would so, and then go a-batfowling 453 .</p>
<p>ANTONIO Nay, good my lord, be not angry.</p>
<p>GONZALO No, I warrant 454 you: I will not adventure my discretion so
weakly 455 . Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy 456 ?</p>
<p>ANTONIO Go sleep, and hear us.</p>
<p>All sleep except Alonso, Sebastian and Antonio</p>
<p>ALONSO What, all so soon asleep? I wish mine eyes</p>
<p>Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts.</p>
<p>I find they are inclined to do so.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Please you, sir,</p>
<p>Do not omit 457 the heavy offer of it 458 .</p>
<p>It seldom visits sorrow: when it doth, it is a comforter.</p>
<p>ANTONIO We two, my lord, will guard your person</p>
<p>While you take your rest, and watch your safety.</p>
<p>ALONSO Thank you. Wondrous heavy.</p>
<p>He sleeps</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN What a strange drowsiness possesses them!</p>
<p>[Exit Ariel ]</p>
<p>ANTONIO It is the quality o’th’climate.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Why</p>
<p>Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find</p>
<p>Not myself disposed to sleep.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Nor I: my spirits are nimble.</p>
<p>They fell together all, as 459 by consent</p>
<p>They dropped, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,</p>
<p>Worthy Sebastian? O, what might? — No more.—</p>
<p>And yet, methinks I see it in thy face,</p>
<p>What thou shouldst be: th’occasion speaks 460 thee, and</p>
<p>My strong imagination sees a crown</p>
<p>Dropping upon thy head.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN What? Art thou waking 461 ?</p>
<p>ANTONIO Do you not hear me speak?</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN I do, and surely</p>
<p>It is a sleepy language and thou speak’st</p>
<p>Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?</p>
<p>This is a strange repose, to be asleep</p>
<p>With eyes wide open: standing, speaking, moving,</p>
<p>And yet so fast asleep.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Noble Sebastian,</p>
<p>Thou let’st thy fortune sleep — die, rather: wink’st 462</p>
<p>Whiles thou art waking.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Thou dost snore distinctly 463 :</p>
<p>There’s meaning in thy snores.</p>
<p>ANTONIO I am more serious than my custom 464 : you</p>
<p>Must be so too, if heed 465 me: which to do</p>
<p>Trebles thee o’er 466 .</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Well, I am standing water 467 .</p>
<p>ANTONIO I’ll teach you how to flow.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Do so: to ebb</p>
<p>Hereditary sloth 468 instructs me.</p>
<p>ANTONIO O,</p>
<p>If you but knew how you the purpose cherish</p>
<p>Whiles thus you mock it 469 : how in stripping it</p>
<p>You more invest 470 it. Ebbing 471 men, indeed,</p>
<p>Most often, do so near the bottom run</p>
<p>By their own fear, or sloth.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Prithee, say on 472 :</p>
<p>The setting 473 of thine eye and cheek proclaim</p>
<p>A matter 474 from thee; and a birth, indeed,</p>
<p>Which throes thee much to yield 475 .</p>
<p>ANTONIO Thus, sir:</p>
<p>Although this lord 476 of weak remembrance 477 , this,</p>
<p>Who shall be of as little memory 478</p>
<p>When he is earthed 479 , hath here almost persuaded —</p>
<p>For he’s a spirit of 480 persuasion, only</p>
<p>Professes 481 to persuade — the king his son’s alive:</p>
<p>’Tis as impossible that he’s undrowned</p>
<p>As he that sleeps here swims.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN I have no hope</p>
<p>That he’s undrowned.</p>
<p>ANTONIO O, out of that ‘no hope’</p>
<p>What great hope have you! No hope that way is</p>
<p>Another way so high a hope 482 , that even</p>
<p>Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,</p>
<p>But doubt discovery there 483 . Will you grant with me</p>
<p>That Ferdinand is drowned?</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN He’s gone.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Then, tell me: who’s the next heir of Naples?</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Claribel.</p>
<p>ANTONIO She that is Queen of Tunis: she that dwells</p>
<p>Ten leagues 484 beyond man’s life 485 : she that from Naples</p>
<p>Can have no note 486 , unless the sun were post 487 —</p>
<p>The man i’th’moon’s too slow — till new-born chins</p>
<p>Be rough and razorable: she that from whom 488</p>
<p>We all were sea-swallowed, though some cast 489 again —</p>
<p>And by that destiny — to perform an act</p>
<p>Whereof what’s past is prologue 490 , what to come</p>
<p>In yours and my discharge 491 .</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN What stuff 492 is this? How say you?</p>
<p>’Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis:</p>
<p>So is she heir of Naples, ’twixt which regions</p>
<p>There is some space 493 .</p>
<p>ANTONIO A space whose every cubit 494</p>
<p>Seems to cry out, ’How shall that Claribel</p>
<p>Measure us back 495 to Naples? Keep 496 in Tunis,</p>
<p>And let Sebastian wake 497 .’ Say this were death</p>
<p>That now hath seized them: why, they were no worse</p>
<p>Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples</p>
<p>As well as he 498 that sleeps: lords that can prate 499</p>
<p>As amply and unnecessarily</p>
<p>As this Gonzalo: I myself could make</p>
<p>A chough of as deep chat 500 . O, that you bore</p>
<p>The mind that I do 501 ! What a sleep were this</p>
<p>For your advancement! Do you understand me?</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Methinks I do.</p>
<p>ANTONIO And how does your content 502</p>
<p>Tender 503 your own good fortune?</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN I remember</p>
<p>You did supplant 504 your brother Prospero.</p>
<p>ANTONIO True:</p>
<p>And look how well my garments 505 sit upon me,</p>
<p>Much feater 506 than before. My brother’s servants</p>
<p>Were then my fellows 507 : now they are my men 508 .</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN But for your conscience.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Ay, sir: where lies that? If ’twere a kibe 509 ,</p>
<p>’Twould put me to 510 my slipper: but I feel not</p>
<p>This deity 511 in my bosom: twenty consciences</p>
<p>That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied 512 be they,</p>
<p>And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,</p>
<p>No better than the earth he lies upon,</p>
<p>If he were that which now he’s like — that’s dead —</p>
<p>Whom I with this obedient steel — three inches of it —</p>
<p>Touching sword or dagger</p>
<p>Can lay to bed forever: whiles you, doing thus,</p>
<p>To the perpetual wink 513 for aye 514 might put</p>
<p>This ancient morsel 515 , this Sir Prudence, who</p>
<p>Should not 516 upbraid our course. For all the rest,</p>
<p>They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk:</p>
<p>They’ll tell the clock to any business that</p>
<p>We say befits the hour 517 .</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Thy case, dear friend,</p>
<p>Shall be my precedent. As thou got’st Milan,</p>
<p>I’ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke</p>
<p>Shall free thee from the tribute 518 which thou payest,</p>
<p>And I the king shall love thee.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Draw together:</p>
<p>And when I rear 519 my hand, do you the like,</p>
<p>To fall it on Gonzalo.</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN O, but one word.</p>
<p>They talk apart</p>
<p>Enter Ariel [invisible ] with music and song</p>
<p>ARIEL My master through his art foresees the danger</p>
<p>To Gonzalo, who still sleeps</p>
<p>That you, his friend, are in, and sends me forth —</p>
<p>For else his project 520 dies — to keep them living.</p>
<p>While you here do snoring lie,</p>
<p>Sings in Gonzalo’s ear</p>
<p>Open-eyed conspiracy</p>
<p>His time 521 doth take.</p>
<p>If of life you keep a care,</p>
<p>Shake off slumber, and beware:</p>
<p>Awake, awake!</p>
<p>ANTONIO Then let us both be sudden.</p>
<p>Antonio and Sebastian draw their swords</p>
<p>GONZALO Now, good angels preserve the king!</p>
<p>Waking</p>
<p>ALONSO Why, how now? Ho, awake! Why are you drawn?</p>
<p>The others wake</p>
<p>Wherefore this ghastly 522 looking?</p>
<p>GONZALO What’s the matter?</p>
<p>SEBASTIAN Whiles we stood here securing your repose,</p>
<p>Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing</p>
<p>Like bulls, or rather lions: did’t not wake you?</p>
<p>It struck mine ear most terribly.</p>
<p>ALONSO I heard nothing.</p>
<p>ANTONIO O, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear,</p>
<p>To make an earthquake! Sure it was the roar</p>
<p>Of a whole herd of lions.</p>
<p>ALONSO Heard you this, Gonzalo?</p>
<p>GONZALO Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,</p>
<p>And that a strange one too, which did awake me:</p>
<p>I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes opened,</p>
<p>I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,</p>
<p>That’s verily 523 . ’Tis best we stand upon our guard,</p>
<p>Or that we quit this place: let’s draw our weapons.</p>
<p>ALONSO Lead off this ground, and let’s make further search</p>
<p>For my poor son.</p>
<p>GONZALO Heavens keep him from these beasts!</p>
<p>For he is sure i’th’island.</p>
<p>ALONSO Lead away.</p>
<p>ARIEL Prospero, my lord, shall know what I have done.</p>
<p>So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.</p>
<p>Exeunt [separately ]</p>
