<h4 id="scene-7-running-scene-7-continues">Scene 7 ／ running scene 7
continues</h4>
<p>Enter Duke Senior and Lord [s ] , like outlaws</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR I think he be transformed into a beast,</p>
<p>For I can nowhere find him like a man.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD My lord, he is but even now gone hence:</p>
<p>Here was he merry, hearing of a song.</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR If he, compact of jars 467 , grow musical,</p>
<p>We shall have shortly discord in the spheres 468 .</p>
<p>Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.</p>
<p>Enter Jaques</p>
<p>FIRST LORD He saves my labour by his own approach.</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR Why, how now, monsieur! What a life is this,</p>
<p>That your poor friends must woo your company?</p>
<p>What, you look merrily.</p>
<p>JAQUES A fool, a fool! I met a fool i’th’forest,</p>
<p>A motley 469 fool — a miserable world.</p>
<p>As I do live by food, I met a fool</p>
<p>Who laid him down and basked him in the sun,</p>
<p>And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms,</p>
<p>In good set terms 470 , and yet a motley fool.</p>
<p>‘Good morrow, fool’, quoth I. ‘No, sir,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune 471 .’</p>
<p>And then he drew a dial 472 from his poke 473 ,</p>
<p>And looking on it with lack-lustre eye,</p>
<p>Says very wisely, ’It is ten o’clock,</p>
<p>Thus we may see’, quoth he, ’how the world wags 474 .</p>
<p>’Tis but an hour 475 ago since it was nine,</p>
<p>And after one hour more ’twill be eleven 476 ,</p>
<p>And so, from hour to hour, we ripe 477 and ripe,</p>
<p>And then, from hour to hour, we rot 478 and rot,</p>
<p>And thereby hangs a tale 479 .’ When I did hear</p>
<p>The motley fool thus moral 480 on the time,</p>
<p>My lungs began to crow like chanticleer 481 ,</p>
<p>That fools should be so deep contemplative 482 ,</p>
<p>And I did laugh sans 483 intermission</p>
<p>An hour by his dial. O noble fool!</p>
<p>A worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear 484 .</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR What fool is this?</p>
<p>JAQUES O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,</p>
<p>And says, if ladies be but young and fair,</p>
<p>They have the gift to know it. And in his brain,</p>
<p>Which is as dry 485 as the remainder 486 biscuit</p>
<p>After a voyage, he hath strange places 487 crammed</p>
<p>With observation, the which he vents 488</p>
<p>In mangled forms. O, that I were a fool!</p>
<p>I am ambitious for a motley coat.</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR Thou shalt have one.</p>
<p>JAQUES It is my only suit 489 ,</p>
<p>Provided that you weed 490 your better judgements</p>
<p>Of all opinion that grows rank 491 in them</p>
<p>That I am wise. I must have liberty</p>
<p>Withal 492 , as large a charter 493 as the wind,</p>
<p>To blow on whom I please, for so fools have.</p>
<p>And they that are most gallèd 494 with my folly,</p>
<p>They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?</p>
<p>The ‘why’ is plain as way 495 to parish church 496 :</p>
<p>He that a fool doth very wisely hit 497</p>
<p>Doth very foolishly, although he smart 498 ,</p>
<p>Seem senseless of the bob 499 . If not,</p>
<p>The wise man’s folly is anatomized 500</p>
<p>Even by the squandering glances 501 of the fool.</p>
<p>Invest 502 me in my motley, give me leave</p>
<p>To speak my mind, and I will through and through</p>
<p>Cleanse 503 the foul body of th’infected world,</p>
<p>If they will patiently receive my medicine.</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.</p>
<p>JAQUES What, for a counter 504 , would I do but good?</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin.</p>
<p>For thou thyself hast been a libertine 505 ,</p>
<p>As sensual as the brutish sting 506 itself;</p>
<p>And all th’embossèd sores and headed evils 507</p>
<p>That thou with licence of free foot hast caught</p>
<p>Wouldst thou disgorge 508 into the general world.</p>
<p>JAQUES Why, who cries out on pride 509 ,</p>
<p>That can therein tax any private party 510 ?</p>
<p>Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,</p>
<p>Till that the weary very means do ebb 511 ?</p>
<p>What woman in the city do I name,</p>
<p>When that I say the city woman bears</p>
<p>The cost of princes 512 on unworthy shoulders?</p>
<p>Who can come in 513 and say that I mean her,</p>
<p>When such a one as she, such is her neighbour?</p>
<p>Or what is he of basest function 514</p>
<p>That says his bravery 515 is not on my cost 516 ,</p>
<p>Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits 517</p>
<p>His folly to the mettle 518 of my speech?</p>
<p>There then, how then, what then? Let me see wherein</p>
<p>My tongue hath wronged him: if it do him right 519 ,</p>
<p>Then he hath wronged himself. If he be free 520 ,</p>
<p>Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,</p>
<p>Unclaimed of any man. But who comes here?</p>
<p>Enter Orlando</p>
<p>ORLANDO Forbear 521 , and eat no more.</p>
<p>Draws his sword</p>
<p>JAQUES Why, I have eat none yet.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.</p>
<p>JAQUES Of what kind should this cock come of? 522</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR Art thou thus boldened, man, by thy distress,</p>
<p>Or else a rude 523 despiser of good manners,</p>
<p>That in civility thou seem’st so empty?</p>
<p>ORLANDO You touched my vein at first 524 . The thorny point</p>
<p>Of bare distress hath ta’en from me the show</p>
<p>Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred 525</p>
<p>And know some nurture 526 . But forbear, I say:</p>
<p>He dies that touches any of this fruit</p>
<p>Till I and my affairs are answerèd 527 .</p>
<p>JAQUES An you will not be answered with reason 528 , I must die.</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR What would you have? Your gentleness 529 shall force</p>
<p>More than your force move us to gentleness.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I almost die for food, and let me have it.</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you.</p>
<p>I thought that all things had been savage here,</p>
<p>And therefore put I on the countenance 530</p>
<p>Of stern commandment. But whate’er you are</p>
<p>That in this desert inaccessible,</p>
<p>Under the shade of melancholy 531 boughs,</p>
<p>Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time,</p>
<p>If ever you have looked on better days,</p>
<p>If ever been where bells have knolled 532 to church,</p>
<p>If ever sat at any good man’s feast,</p>
<p>If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear</p>
<p>And know what ’tis to pity and be pitied,</p>
<p>Let gentleness my strong enforcement 533 be:</p>
<p>In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.</p>
<p>Sheathes his sword</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR True is it that we have seen better days,</p>
<p>And have with holy bell been knolled to church,</p>
<p>And sat at good men’s feasts, and wiped our eyes</p>
<p>Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered:</p>
<p>And therefore sit you down in gentleness,</p>
<p>And take upon command 534 what help we have</p>
<p>That to your wanting 535 may be ministered.</p>
<p>ORLANDO Then but forbear your food a little while,</p>
<p>Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn</p>
<p>And give it food. There is an old poor man,</p>
<p>Who after me hath many a weary step</p>
<p>Limped in pure love: till he be first sufficed,</p>
<p>Oppressed with two weak 536 evils, age and hunger,</p>
<p>I will not touch a bit.</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR Go find him out.</p>
<p>And we will nothing waste 537 till you return.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I thank ye, and be blest for your good comfort!</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR Thou see’st we are not all alone unhappy 538 :</p>
<p>This wide and universal theatre</p>
<p>Presents more woeful pageants than the scene</p>
<p>Wherein we play in.</p>
<p>JAQUES All the world’s a stage,</p>
<p>And all the men and women merely players;</p>
<p>They have their exits and their entrances,</p>
<p>And one man in his time plays many parts,</p>
<p>His acts 539 being seven ages. At first the infant,</p>
<p>Mewling 540 and puking in the nurse’s arms.</p>
<p>Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel</p>
<p>And shining morning face, creeping like snail</p>
<p>Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</p>
<p>Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</p>
<p>Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,</p>
<p>Full of strange 541 oaths and bearded like the pard 542 ,</p>
<p>Jealous in 543 honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,</p>
<p>Seeking the bubble reputation</p>
<p>Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,</p>
<p>In fair round belly with good capon 544 lined,</p>
<p>With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</p>
<p>Full of wise saws 545 and modern instances 546 .</p>
<p>And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</p>
<p>Into the lean and slippered pantaloon 547 ,</p>
<p>With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</p>
<p>His youthful hose 548 , well saved, a world too wide</p>
<p>For his shrunk shank 549 , and his 550 big manly voice,</p>
<p>Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</p>
<p>And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</p>
<p>That ends this strange eventful history 551 ,</p>
<p>Is second childishness and mere 552 oblivion,</p>
<p>Sans 553 teeth, sans eyes 554 , sans taste, sans everything.</p>
<p>Enter Orlando, with Adam</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR Welcome. Set down your venerable burden,</p>
<p>And let him feed.</p>
<p>ORLANDO I thank you most for him.</p>
<p>Sets down Adam</p>
<p>ADAM So had you need.</p>
<p>I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR Welcome, fall to 555 . I will not trouble you</p>
<p>As yet, to question you about your fortunes.—</p>
<p>Give us some music, and, good cousin, sing.</p>
<p>Song 556</p>
<p>Blow, blow, thou winter wind,</p>
<p>Thou art not so unkind 557</p>
<p>As man’s ingratitude.</p>
<p>Thy tooth is not so keen 558 ,</p>
<p>Because thou art not seen,</p>
<p>Although thy breath be rude 559 .</p>
<p>Heigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly.</p>
<p>Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:</p>
<p>The hey-ho, the holly.</p>
<p>This life is most jolly.</p>
<p>Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky</p>
<p>That dost not bite so nigh 560</p>
<p>As benefits forgot:</p>
<p>Though thou the waters warp 561 ,</p>
<p>Thy sting is not so sharp</p>
<p>As friend remembered not.</p>
<p>Hey-ho, sing, etc.</p>
<p>DUKE SENIOR If that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son,</p>
<p>To Orlando</p>
<p>As you have whispered faithfully 562 you were,</p>
<p>And as mine eye doth his effigies 563 witness</p>
<p>Most truly limned 564 and living in your face,</p>
<p>Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke</p>
<p>That loved your father. The residue of your fortune,</p>
<p>Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,</p>
<p>Thou art right welcome as thy master is.</p>
<p>Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,</p>
<p>And let me all your fortunes 565 understand.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
