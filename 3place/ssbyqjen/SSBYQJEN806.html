<h4 id="scene-1-587-running-scene-9">Scene 1 587 / running scene 9</h4>
<p>Sound a sennet. Enter King [Henry VI ], Queen [Margaret ], Cardinal,
Suffolk, York, Buckingham, Salisbury and Warwick to the parliament [with
Attendants ]</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI I muse 588 my lord of Gloucester is not come:</p>
<p>’Tis not his wont 589 to be the hindmost 590 man,</p>
<p>Whate’er occasion keeps him from us now.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Can you not see? Or will ye not observe</p>
<p>The strangeness 591 of his altered countenance?</p>
<p>With what a majesty he bears himself,</p>
<p>How insolent 592 of late he is become,</p>
<p>How proud, how peremptory 593 , and unlike himself?</p>
<p>We know 594 the time since 595 he was mild and affable,</p>
<p>And if we did but glance a far-off 596 look,</p>
<p>Immediately he was upon his knee,</p>
<p>That all the court admired him for 597 submission.</p>
<p>But meet him now, and be it in the morn,</p>
<p>When everyone will give the time of day 598 ,</p>
<p>He knits his brow 599 and shows an angry eye,</p>
<p>And passeth by with stiff unbowèd knee 600 ,</p>
<p>Disdaining duty 601 that to us belongs.</p>
<p>Small curs 602 are not regarded when they grin 603 ,</p>
<p>But great men tremble when the lion roars,</p>
<p>And Humphrey is no little man in England.</p>
<p>First note that he is near you in descent,</p>
<p>And should you fall, he is the next will mount.</p>
<p>Meseemeth 604 then it is no policy 605 ,</p>
<p>Respecting 606 what a rancorous 607 mind he bears,</p>
<p>And his advantage following your decease,</p>
<p>That he should come about 608 your royal person</p>
<p>Or be admitted to your highness’ Council.</p>
<p>By flattery hath he won the commons’ hearts:</p>
<p>And when he please to make commotion 609 ,</p>
<p>’Tis to be feared they all will follow him.</p>
<p>Now ’tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted 610 :</p>
<p>Suffer 611 them now, and they’ll o’ergrow the garden</p>
<p>And choke the herbs for want 612 of husbandry 613 .</p>
<p>The reverent care I bear unto my lord</p>
<p>Made me collect 614 these dangers in the duke.</p>
<p>If it be fond 615 , call it a woman’s fear:</p>
<p>Which fear, if better reasons can supplant 616 ,</p>
<p>I will subscribe 617 and say I wronged the duke.</p>
<p>My lord of Suffolk, Buckingham and York,</p>
<p>Reprove 618 my allegation, if you can,</p>
<p>Or else conclude my words effectual 619 .</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Well hath your highness seen into this duke:</p>
<p>And had I first been put 620 to speak my mind,</p>
<p>I think I should have told your grace’s tale.</p>
<p>The duchess, by his subornation 621 ,</p>
<p>Upon my life, began her devilish practices 622 :</p>
<p>Or if he were not privy to 623 those faults,</p>
<p>Yet by reputing 624 of his high descent,</p>
<p>As next the 625 king he was successive heir,</p>
<p>And such high vaunts 626 of his nobility,</p>
<p>Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick 627 duchess</p>
<p>By wicked means to frame 628 our sovereign’s fall.</p>
<p>Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep:</p>
<p>And in his simple show 629 he harbours treason.</p>
<p>The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.—</p>
<p>No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man</p>
<p>To King Henry</p>
<p>Unsounded 630 yet and full of deep deceit.</p>
<p>CARDINAL Did he not, contrary to form of law,</p>
<p>To King Henry</p>
<p>Devise strange 631 deaths for small offences done?</p>
<p>YORK And did he not, in his Protectorship,</p>
<p>To King Henry</p>
<p>Levy 632 great sums of money through the realm</p>
<p>For soldiers’ pay in France, and never sent it,</p>
<p>By means whereof 633 the towns each day revolted?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Tut, these are petty faults to 634 faults unknown,</p>
<p>Which time will bring to light in smooth 635 Duke Humphrey.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI My lords, at once 636 : the care you have of us</p>
<p>To mow down thorns that would annoy 637 our foot</p>
<p>Is worthy praise: but shall I 638 speak my conscience,</p>
<p>Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent</p>
<p>From meaning treason to our royal person</p>
<p>As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:</p>
<p>The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given 639</p>
<p>To dream on evil or to work my downfall.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Ah, what’s more dangerous than this fond affiance 640
?</p>
<p>Seems he a dove? His feathers are but borrowed,</p>
<p>For he’s disposèd as 641 the hateful raven 642 .</p>
<p>Is he a lamb? His skin is surely lent him,</p>
<p>For he’s inclined 643 as is the ravenous wolves 644 .</p>
<p>Who cannot steal a shape 645 that means 646 deceit?</p>
<p>Take heed, my lord, the welfare of us all</p>
<p>Hangs 647 on the cutting short 648 that fraudful 649 man.</p>
<p>Enter Somerset</p>
<p>SOMERSET All health unto my gracious sovereign.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?</p>
<p>SOMERSET That all your interest 650 in those territories</p>
<p>Is utterly bereft 651 you: all is lost.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God’s will be done.</p>
<p>YORK Cold news for me: for I had hope of France</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>As firmly as I hope for fertile England.</p>
<p>Thus are my blossoms blasted 652 in the bud</p>
<p>And caterpillars eat my leaves away:</p>
<p>But I will remedy this gear 653 ere long,</p>
<p>Or sell my title for a glorious grave.</p>
<p>Enter Gloucester</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER All happiness unto my lord the king:</p>
<p>Pardon, my liege, that I have stayed 654 so long.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,</p>
<p>Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:</p>
<p>I do arrest thee of high treason here.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush</p>
<p>Nor change my countenance for this arrest:</p>
<p>A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.</p>
<p>The purest spring is not so free from mud</p>
<p>As I am clear from treason to my sovereign.</p>
<p>Who can accuse me? Wherein am I guilty?</p>
<p>YORK ’Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of 655 France,</p>
<p>And, being Protector, stayed 656 the soldiers’ pay,</p>
<p>By means whereof his highness hath lost France.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Is it but thought so? What 657 are they that think it?</p>
<p>I never robbed the soldiers of their pay,</p>
<p>Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.</p>
<p>So help me God, as I have watched the night 658 ,</p>
<p>Ay, night by night, in studying 659 good for England,</p>
<p>That 660 doit 661 that e’er I wrested from the king,</p>
<p>Or any groat 662 I hoarded to my use,</p>
<p>Be brought against me at my trial day!</p>
<p>No: many a pound of mine own proper store 663 ,</p>
<p>Because I would not tax the needy commons,</p>
<p>Have I disbursèd 664 to the garrisons,</p>
<p>And never asked for restitution.</p>
<p>CARDINAL It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER I say no more than truth, so help me God.</p>
<p>YORK In your Protectorship you did devise</p>
<p>Strange tortures for offenders, never heard of,</p>
<p>That 665 England was defamed by 666 tyranny.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Why, ’tis well known that whiles 667 I was Protector,</p>
<p>Pity was all the fault that was in me:</p>
<p>For I should melt at an offender’s tears,</p>
<p>And lowly words were ransom for their fault 668 :</p>
<p>Unless it were a bloody murderer,</p>
<p>Or foul felonious 669 thief that fleeced 670 poor passengers 671
,</p>
<p>I never gave them condign 672 punishment.</p>
<p>Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured</p>
<p>Above the felon or what trespass else 673 .</p>
<p>SUFFOLK My lord, these faults are easy 674 , quickly answered:</p>
<p>But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,</p>
<p>Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.</p>
<p>I do arrest you in his highness’ name,</p>
<p>And here commit you to my lord cardinal</p>
<p>To keep 675 until your further 676 time of trial.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI My lord of Gloucester, ’tis my special hope</p>
<p>That you will clear yourself from all suspense 677 :</p>
<p>My conscience tells me you are innocent.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:</p>
<p>Virtue is choked with foul ambition</p>
<p>And charity chased hence by rancour’s hand:</p>
<p>Foul subornation 678 is predominant 679</p>
<p>And equity 680 exiled your highness’ land.</p>
<p>I know their complot 681 is to have my life:</p>
<p>And if my death might make this island happy,</p>
<p>And prove the period 682 of their tyranny,</p>
<p>I would expend it 683 with all willingness.</p>
<p>But mine 684 is made the prologue to their play:</p>
<p>For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,</p>
<p>Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.</p>
<p>Beaufort’s red sparkling eyes blab 685 his heart’s malice,</p>
<p>And Suffolk’s cloudy brow his stormy hate:</p>
<p>Sharp 686 Buckingham unburdens with his tongue</p>
<p>The envious 687 load that lies upon his heart:</p>
<p>And doggèd 688 York, that reaches at the moon,</p>
<p>Whose overweening 689 arm I have plucked back,</p>
<p>By false accuse 690 doth level 691 at my life.—</p>
<p>And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,</p>
<p>To Queen Margaret</p>
<p>Causeless 692 have laid disgraces on my head,</p>
<p>And with your best endeavour have stirred up</p>
<p>My liefest liege 693 to be mine enemy:</p>
<p>Ay, all of you have laid your heads together —</p>
<p>Myself had notice of your conventicles 694 —</p>
<p>And all to make away my guiltless life.</p>
<p>I shall not want 695 false witness to condemn me,</p>
<p>Nor store 696 of treasons to augment my guilt:</p>
<p>The ancient proverb will be well effected:</p>
<p>‘A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.’</p>
<p>CARDINAL My liege, his railing 697 is intolerable.</p>
<p>If those that care to keep your royal person</p>
<p>From treason’s secret knife and traitors’ rage</p>
<p>Be thus upbraided, chid 698 and rated at 699 ,</p>
<p>And the offender granted scope 700 of speech,</p>
<p>’Twill make them cool in zeal 701 unto your grace.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Hath he not twit 702 our sovereign lady here</p>
<p>With ignominious words, though clerkly couched 703 ,</p>
<p>As if she had subornèd 704 some to swear</p>
<p>False allegations to o’erthrow his state 705 ?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET But I can give the loser leave to chide.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Far truer spoke than meant: I lose indeed:</p>
<p>Beshrew 706 the winners, for they played me false 707 ,</p>
<p>And well such losers may have leave to speak.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM He’ll wrest the sense 708 and hold us here all day.</p>
<p>Lord Cardinal, he is your prisoner.</p>
<p>CARDINAL Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure 709 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Ah, thus King Henry throws away his crutch</p>
<p>Before his legs be firm to bear his body.</p>
<p>Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,</p>
<p>And wolves are gnarling 710 who shall gnaw thee first.</p>
<p>Ah, that my fear were false: ah, that it were:</p>
<p>For, good King Henry, thy decay 711 I fear.</p>
<p>Exit Gloucester [guarded ]</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,</p>
<p>Do or undo, as if ourself were here.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET What, will your highness leave the parliament?</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Ay, Margaret: my heart is drowned with grief,</p>
<p>Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes:</p>
<p>My body round engirt 712 with misery:</p>
<p>For what’s more miserable than discontent?—</p>
<p>Ah, uncle Humphrey, in thy face I see</p>
<p>The map 713 of honour, truth and loyalty:</p>
<p>And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come</p>
<p>That e’er I proved thee false 714 or feared thy faith 715 .</p>
<p>What louring star now envies thy estate 716 ,</p>
<p>That these great lords and Margaret our queen</p>
<p>Do seek subversion 717 of thy harmless life?</p>
<p>Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong:</p>
<p>And as the butcher takes away the calf,</p>
<p>And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays 718 ,</p>
<p>Bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse,</p>
<p>Even so remorseless have they borne him hence:</p>
<p>And as the dam 719 runs lowing up and down,</p>
<p>Looking the way her harmless young one went,</p>
<p>And can do naught but wail her darling’s loss,</p>
<p>Even so myself bewails good Gloucester’s case</p>
<p>With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimmed eyes</p>
<p>Look after him, and cannot do him good:</p>
<p>So mighty are his vowèd 720 enemies.</p>
<p>His fortunes I will weep, and ’twixt 721 each groan</p>
<p>Say ‘Who’s a traitor? Gloucester he is none.’</p>
<p>Exit [with Buckingham, Salisbury and Warwick ]</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Free 722 lords, cold snow melts with the sun’s hot
beams:</p>
<p>Henry my lord is cold 723 in great affairs,</p>
<p>Too full of foolish pity: and Gloucester’s show 724</p>
<p>Beguiles 725 him as the mournful crocodile</p>
<p>With sorrow snares relenting 726 passengers 727 ,</p>
<p>Or as the snake rolled in a flow’ring bank,</p>
<p>With shining chequered slough 728 , doth sting a child</p>
<p>That for the beauty thinks it excellent.</p>
<p>Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I—</p>
<p>And yet herein I judge mine own wit 729 good—</p>
<p>This Gloucester should be quickly rid 730 the world,</p>
<p>To rid us from the fear we have of him.</p>
<p>CARDINAL That he should die is worthy 731 policy:</p>
<p>But yet we want a colour 732 for his death:</p>
<p>’Tis meet 733 he be condemned by course of law.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK But, in my mind, that were 734 no policy 735 :</p>
<p>The king will labour still 736 to save his life,</p>
<p>The commons haply rise 737 , to save his life:</p>
<p>And yet we have but trivial argument 738 ,</p>
<p>More than mistrust 739 , that shows him worthy death.</p>
<p>YORK So that, by this 740 , you would not have him die.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Ah, York, no man alive so fain 741 as I.</p>
<p>YORK ’Tis York that hath more reason for his death.—</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>But, my lord cardinal, and you my lord of Suffolk,</p>
<p>Aloud</p>
<p>Say as you think, and speak it from your souls:</p>
<p>Were’t not all one 742 , an empty 743 eagle were set</p>
<p>To guard the chicken from a hungry kite 744 ,</p>
<p>As place Duke Humphrey for the king’s Protector?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET So the poor chicken should be sure of death.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Madam, ’tis true: and were’t not madness then</p>
<p>To make the fox surveyor of the fold 745 ,</p>
<p>Who being accused a crafty murderer,</p>
<p>His guilt should be but idly posted over 746 ,</p>
<p>Because his purpose is not executed 747 ?</p>
<p>No: let him die, in that he is a fox,</p>
<p>By nature proved an enemy to the flock,</p>
<p>Before his chaps 748 be stained with crimson blood,</p>
<p>As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege 749 .</p>
<p>And do not stand 750 on quillets 751 how to slay him:</p>
<p>Be it by gins, by snares 752 , by subtlety 753 ,</p>
<p>Sleeping or waking, ’tis no matter how,</p>
<p>So 754 he be dead: for that is good deceit</p>
<p>Which mates 755 him first that first intends deceit.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Thrice-noble Suffolk, ’tis resolutely spoke.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Not resolute, except 756 so much were done:</p>
<p>For things are often spoke and seldom meant:</p>
<p>But that 757 my heart accordeth 758 with my tongue,</p>
<p>Seeing the deed is meritorious 759 ,</p>
<p>And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,</p>
<p>Say but the word, and I will be his priest 760 .</p>
<p>CARDINAL But I would have him dead, my lord of Suffolk,</p>
<p>Ere you can take due orders for a priest 761 :</p>
<p>Say you consent and censure 762 well the deed,</p>
<p>And I’ll provide his executioner,</p>
<p>I tender so 763 the safety of my liege.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET And so say I.</p>
<p>YORK And I: and now we three have spoke it,</p>
<p>It skills not greatly who impugns our doom 764 .</p>
<p>Enter a Post 765</p>
<p>POST Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain 766</p>
<p>To signify 767 that rebels there are up 768</p>
<p>And put the Englishmen unto the sword.</p>
<p>Send succours 769 , lords, and stop the rage betime 770 ,</p>
<p>Before the wound do grow uncurable:</p>
<p>For, being green 771 , there is great hope of help.</p>
<p>CARDINAL A breach 772 that craves a quick expedient stop!</p>
<p>What counsel give you in this weighty cause 773 ?</p>
<p>YORK That Somerset be sent as regent thither:</p>
<p>’Tis meet 774 that lucky ruler be employed:</p>
<p>Witness the fortune he hath had in France 775 .</p>
<p>SOMERSET If York, with all his far-fet 776 policy,</p>
<p>Had been the regent there instead of me,</p>
<p>He never would have stayed in France so long.</p>
<p>YORK No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done.</p>
<p>I rather would have lost my life betimes 777</p>
<p>Than bring a burden of dishonour home</p>
<p>By staying there so long till all were lost.</p>
<p>Show me one scar charactered 778 on thy skin:</p>
<p>Men’s flesh 779 preserved so whole do seldom win.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire</p>
<p>If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with:</p>
<p>No more, good York: sweet Somerset, be still:</p>
<p>Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,</p>
<p>Might happily 780 have proved far worse than his.</p>
<p>YORK What, worse than naught? Nay, then a shame take all!</p>
<p>SOMERSET And, in the number 781 , thee that wishest shame.</p>
<p>CARDINAL My lord of York, try 782 what your fortune is:</p>
<p>The uncivil 783 kerns 784 of Ireland are in arms</p>
<p>And temper clay 785 with blood of Englishmen.</p>
<p>To Ireland will you lead a band of men,</p>
<p>Collected choicely 786 , from each county some,</p>
<p>And try your hap 787 against the Irishmen?</p>
<p>YORK I will, my lord, so please his majesty.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Why, our authority is his consent,</p>
<p>And what we do establish he confirms:</p>
<p>Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.</p>
<p>YORK I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,</p>
<p>Whiles I take order 788 for mine own affairs.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK A charge, Lord York, that I will see performed.</p>
<p>But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.</p>
<p>CARDINAL No more of him: for I will deal with him</p>
<p>That henceforth he shall trouble us no more:</p>
<p>And so break off: the day is almost spent.</p>
<p>Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.</p>
<p>YORK My lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days</p>
<p>At Bristol I expect my soldiers,</p>
<p>For there I’ll ship them all for Ireland.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK I’ll see it truly done, my lord of York</p>
<p>Exeunt [leaving ] York</p>
<p>YORK Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,</p>
<p>And change misdoubt 789 to resolution:</p>
<p>Be that 790 thou hop’st to be, or what thou art</p>
<p>Resign to death: it is not worth th’enjoying:</p>
<p>Let pale-faced fear keep 791 with the mean-born 792 man,</p>
<p>And find no harbour 793 in a royal heart.</p>
<p>Faster than springtime showers comes thought on thought,</p>
<p>And not a thought but thinks on dignity 794 .</p>
<p>My brain, more busy than the labouring spider,</p>
<p>Weaves tedious 795 snares to trap mine enemies.</p>
<p>Well, nobles, well: ’tis politicly 796 done,</p>
<p>To send me packing with an host of men:</p>
<p>I fear me 797 you but warm the starvèd 798 snake,</p>
<p>Who, cherished in your breasts, will sting your hearts 799 .</p>
<p>’Twas men I lacked and you will give them me:</p>
<p>I take it kindly: yet be well assured</p>
<p>You put sharp weapons in a madman’s hands.</p>
<p>Whiles I in Ireland nourish 800 a mighty band,</p>
<p>I will stir up in England some black storm</p>
<p>Shall 801 blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell:</p>
<p>And this fell 802 tempest shall not cease to rage</p>
<p>Until the golden circuit 803 on my head,</p>
<p>Like to the glorious sun’s transparent beams,</p>
<p>Do calm the fury of this mad-bred 804 flaw 805 .</p>
<p>And for a minister of my intent 806 ,</p>
<p>I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,</p>
<p>John Cade of Ashford 807 ,</p>
<p>To make commotion 808 , as full well he can,</p>
<p>Under the title of John Mortimer 809 .</p>
<p>In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade</p>
<p>Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,</p>
<p>And fought so long, till that 810 his thighs with darts 811</p>
<p>Were almost like a sharp-quilled porcupine:</p>
<p>And in the end, being rescued, I have seen</p>
<p>Him caper 812 upright like a wild Morisco 813 ,</p>
<p>Shaking the bloody darts as he 814 his bells 815 .</p>
<p>Full 816 often, like a shag-haired 817 crafty kern,</p>
<p>Hath he conversèd with the enemy,</p>
<p>And, undiscovered, come to me again</p>
<p>And given me notice 818 of their villainies.</p>
<p>This devil here shall be my substitute:</p>
<p>For that John Mortimer, which now is dead 819 ,</p>
<p>In face, in gait 820 , in speech, he doth resemble.</p>
<p>By this I shall perceive the commons’ 821 mind,</p>
<p>How they affect 822 the house and claim of York.</p>
<p>Say he be taken 823 , racked 824 and torturèd,</p>
<p>I know no pain they can inflict upon him</p>
<p>Will make him say I moved 825 him to those arms.</p>
<p>Say that he thrive, as ’tis great like 826 he will,</p>
<p>Why then from Ireland come I with my strength</p>
<p>And reap the harvest which that rascal 827 sowed.</p>
<p>For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,</p>
<p>And Henry put apart 828 , the next for me.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
