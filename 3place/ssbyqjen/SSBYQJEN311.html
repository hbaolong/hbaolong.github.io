<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-2">Scene 2 / running scene 2</h4>
<p>Enter Cressida and her Man [Alexander ]</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Who were those went by?</p>
<p>ALEXANDER Queen Hecuba and Helen.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA And whither go they?</p>
<p>ALEXANDER Up to the eastern tower,</p>
<p>Whose height commands as subject 117 all the vale,</p>
<p>To see the battle. Hector, whose patience</p>
<p>Is as a virtue fixed 118 , today was moved 119 :</p>
<p>He chides Andromache and struck his armourer,</p>
<p>And, like as 120 there were husbandry 121 in war,</p>
<p>Before the sun rose he was harnessed light 122 ,</p>
<p>And to the field goes he, where every flower</p>
<p>Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw</p>
<p>In Hector’s wrath.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA What was his cause of anger?</p>
<p>ALEXANDER The noise 123 goes, this: there is among the Greeks</p>
<p>A lord of Trojan blood, nephew 124 to Hector:</p>
<p>They call him Ajax.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Good 125 , and what of him?</p>
<p>ALEXANDER They say he is a very man per se 126 , and stands alone 127
.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs
128 .</p>
<p>ALEXANDER This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their particular
additions 129 : he is as valiant as the lion, churlish 130 as the bear,
slow 131 as the elephant: a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours
132 that his valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with
discretion. There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse 133
of, nor any man an attaint 134 but he carries some stain of it: he is
melancholy without cause, and merry against the hair 135 : he hath the
joints 136 of everything, but everything so out of joint that he is a
gouty 137 Briareus 138 , many hands and no use, or purblinded 139 Argus
140 , all eyes and no sight.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA But how should this man, that makes me smile make Hector
angry?</p>
<p>ALEXANDER They say he yesterday coped 141 Hector in the battle and
struck him down, the disdain 142 and shame whereof 143 hath ever since
kept Hector fasting and waking 144 .</p>
<p>Enter Pandarus</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Who comes here?</p>
<p>ALEXANDER Madam, your uncle Pandarus.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Hector’s a gallant man.</p>
<p>ALEXANDER As may be in the world, lady.</p>
<p>PANDARUS What’s that? What’s that?</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Good morrow, cousin Cressid. What do you talk of?— Good
morrow,</p>
<p>Alexander.— How do you, cousin? When were you at Ilium?</p>
<p>CRESSIDA This morning, uncle.</p>
<p>PANDARUS What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector armed and
gone ere 145 ye came to Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.</p>
<p>PANDARUS E’en so; Hector was stirring early.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA That were we talking of, and of his anger.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Was he angry?</p>
<p>CRESSIDA So he says here.</p>
<p>PANDARUS True, he was so; I know the cause too: he’ll lay about him
146 today, I can tell them that, and there’s Troilus will not come far
behind him: let them take heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA What, is he angry too?</p>
<p>PANDARUS Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA O Jupiter 147 , there’s no comparison.</p>
<p>PANDARUS What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man 148
if you see him?</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.</p>
<p>PANDARUS No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees 149 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA ’Tis just 150 to each of them: he is himself.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Himself? Alas, poor Troilus, I would he were.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA So he is.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Condition, I had gone barefoot to India 151 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA He is not Hector.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Himself? No, he’s not himself: would a 152 were himself!
Well, the gods are above, time must friend or end 153 . Well, Troilus,
well. I would my heart were in her body. No, Hector is not a better man
than Troilus.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Excuse me 154 .</p>
<p>PANDARUS He is elder.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Pardon me, pardon me.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Th’other’s not come to’t 155 ; you shall tell me another
tale 156 , when th’other’s come to’t. Hector shall not have his wit 157
this year.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA He shall not need it if he have his own.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Nor his qualities.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA No matter.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Nor his beauty.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA ’Twould not become 158 him: his own’s better.</p>
<p>PANDARUS You have no judgement, niece; Helen herself swore th’other
day that Troilus for a brown favour 159 — for so ’tis, I must confess —
not brown neither—</p>
<p>CRESSIDA No, but brown 160 .</p>
<p>PANDARUS ’Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA To say the truth, true and not true.</p>
<p>PANDARUS She praised his complexion above Paris.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Why, Paris hath colour enough.</p>
<p>PANDARUS So he has.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Then Troilus should 161 have too much: if she praised him
above, his complexion is higher than his 162 : he having colour enough,
and the other higher, is too flaming 163 a praise for a good complexion.
I had as lief 164 Helen’s golden tongue had commended Troilus for a
copper 165 nose.</p>
<p>PANDARUS I swear to you, I think Helen loves him better than
Paris.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Then she’s a merry Greek 166 indeed.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th’other day into
the compassed 167 window — and, you know, he has not past three or four
hairs on his chin—</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Indeed, a tapster 168 ’s arithmetic 169 may soon bring his
particulars 170 therein to a total.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Why, he is very young, and yet will he within three pound
lift as much as his brother Hector.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Is he so young a man and so old 171 a lifter 172 ?</p>
<p>PANDARUS But to prove to you that Helen loves him, she came and puts
me her white hand to his cloven 173 chin—</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Juno 174 have mercy! How came it cloven?</p>
<p>PANDARUS Why, you know ’tis dimpled. I think his smiling becomes him
better than any man in all Phrygia.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA O, he smiles valiantly.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Does he not?</p>
<p>CRESSIDA O yes, an ’twere a cloud in autumn 175 .</p>
<p>PANDARUS Why, go to, then. But to prove to you that Helen loves
Troilus—</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Troilus will stand to the proof 176 , if you’ll prove it
so.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Troilus? Why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle
177 egg.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head,
you would eat chickens i’th’shell 178 .</p>
<p>PANDARUS I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin.
Indeed, she has a marvellous 179 white hand, I must needs confess 180
—</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Without the rack 181 .</p>
<p>PANDARUS And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Alas, poor chin. Many a wart is richer 182 .</p>
<p>PANDARUS But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed that 183
her eyes ran o’er 184 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA With millstones 185 .</p>
<p>PANDARUS And Cassandra laughed.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA But there was more temperate fire under the pot 186 of her
eyes: did her eyes run o’er too?</p>
<p>PANDARUS And Hector laughed.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA At what was all this laughing?</p>
<p>PANDARUS Marry 187 , at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus’
chin.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA An’t had been a green 188 hair, I should have laughed
too.</p>
<p>PANDARUS They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty 189
answer.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA What was his answer?</p>
<p>PANDARUS Quoth she, ‘Here’s but two and fifty hairs 190 on your chin,
and one of them is white.’</p>
<p>CRESSIDA This is her question.</p>
<p>PANDARUS That’s true, make no question of that. ‘Two and fifty
hairs,’ quoth he, ’and</p>
<p>one white: that white hair is my father, and all the rest are his
sons 191 .’ ‘Jupiter!’ quoth she, ‘Which of these hairs is Paris, my
husband?’ ‘The forked 192 one,’ quoth</p>
<p>he, ‘pluck’t out, and give it him.’ But there was such laughing, and
Helen so blushed, and Paris so chafed 193 , and all the rest so laughed,
that it passed 194 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA So let it now 195 , for it has been a great while going by
196 .</p>
<p>PANDARUS Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday: think on’t.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA So I do.</p>
<p>PANDARUS I’ll be sworn ’tis true, he will weep you, an ’twere a man
born in April 197 .</p>
<p>Sound a retreat</p>
<p>CRESSIDA And I’ll spring 198 up in his tears, an ’twere a nettle
against May 199 .</p>
<p>PANDARUS Hark, they are coming from the field: shall we stand up here
and see them as they pass toward Ilium? Good niece, do, sweet niece
Cressida.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA At your pleasure.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Here, here, here’s an excellent place, here we may see most
bravely 200 . I’ll tell you them all by their names as they pass by, but
mark 201 Troilus above the rest.</p>
<p>Enter Aeneas [and passes over the stage ]</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Speak not so loud.</p>
<p>PANDARUS That’s Aeneas. Is not that a brave 202 man? He’s one of the
flowers of Troy, I can tell you. But mark Troilus: you shall see anon
203 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Who’s that?</p>
<p>Enter Antenor [and passes over the stage ]</p>
<p>PANDARUS That’s Antenor. He has a shrewd 204 wit, I can tell you, and
he’s a man good enough: he’s one o’th’soundest judgement 205 in Troy
whosoever 206 , and a proper man of person 207 . When comes Troilus?
I’ll show you Troilus anon: if he see me, you shall see him nod at
me.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Will he give you the nod 208 ?</p>
<p>PANDARUS You shall see.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA If he do, the rich shall have more 209 .</p>
<p>Enter Hector [and passes over the stage ]</p>
<p>PANDARUS That’s Hector, that, that, look you, that there’s a fellow!
Go thy way 210 , Hector! There’s a brave man, niece. O brave Hector!
Look how he looks! There’s a countenance 211 . Is’t not a brave man?</p>
<p>CRESSIDA O brave man!</p>
<p>PANDARUS Is a 212 not? It does a man’s heart good. Look you what
hacks 213 are on his helmet. Look you yonder, do you see? Look you
there? There’s no jesting 214 , there’s laying on 215 , take’t off who
will 216 , as they say. There be hacks!</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Be those with swords 217 ?</p>
<p>Enter Paris [and passes over the stage ]</p>
<p>PANDARUS Swords, anything, he cares not: an the devil come to him,
it’s all one. By God’s lid 218 , it does one’s heart good. Yonder comes
Paris, yonder comes Paris. Look ye yonder, niece. Is’t not a gallant man
too, is’t not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came hurt home today?
He’s not hurt. Why, this will do Helen’s heart good now, ha? Would I
could see Troilus now. You shall see Troilus anon.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Who’s that?</p>
<p>Enter Helenus [and passes over the stage ]</p>
<p>PANDARUS That’s Helenus. I marvel 219 where Troilus is. That’s
Helenus, I think he 220 went not forth 221 today: that’s Helenus.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Can Helenus fight, uncle?</p>
<p>PANDARUS Helenus? No. Yes, he’ll fight indifferent 222 well. I marvel
where Troilus is. Hark, do you not hear the people cry ‘Troilus’?
Helenus is a priest.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA What sneaking 223 fellow comes yonder?</p>
<p>Enter Troilus [and passes over the stage ]</p>
<p>PANDARUS Where? Yonder? That’s Deiphobus. ’Tis Troilus! There’s a
man, niece!— Hem 224 ! Brave Troilus, the prince of chivalry!</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Peace, for shame, peace!</p>
<p>PANDARUS Mark him, note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon him,
niece. Look you how his sword is bloodied, and his helm 225 more hacked
than Hector’s, and how he looks, and how he goes 226 . O admirable
youth! He ne’er saw three and twenty 227 . Go thy way, Troilus, go thy
way! Had I a sister were a grace 228 , or a daughter a goddess, he
should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris? Paris is dirt to 229
him, and I warrant 230 Helen, to change 231 , would give money to boot
232 .</p>
<p>Enter Common Soldiers [and pass over the stage ]</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Here come more.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Asses, fools, dolts. Chaff and bran 233 , chaff and bran;
porridge after meat 234 . I could live and die i’th’eyes of Troilus.
Ne’er look, ne’er look. The eagles are gone: crows and daws 235 , crows
and daws! I had rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and all
Greece.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than
Troilus.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Achilles? A drayman 236 , a porter, a very camel 237 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Well, well.</p>
<p>PANDARUS ‘Well, well’? Why, have you any discretion 238 ? Have you
any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not birth 239 , beauty, good
shape, discourse 240 , manhood, learning, gentleness 241 , virtue,
youth, liberality 242 , and so forth, the spice and salt that seasons a
man?</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Ay, a minced 243 man, and then to be baked with no date in
the pie 244 , for then the man’s date’s out 245 .</p>
<p>PANDARUS You are such another woman 246 ! One knows not at what ward
you lie 247 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Upon my back, to defend my belly 248 ; upon my wit 249 , to
defend my wiles 250 ; upon my secrecy 251 , to defend mine honesty 252 ;
my mask 253 , to defend my beauty, and you, to defend all these: and at
all these wards 254 I lie at, at a thousand watches 255 .</p>
<p>PANDARUS Say one of your watches 256 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Nay, I’ll watch 257 you for that, and that’s one of the
chiefest of them 258 too: if I cannot ward 259 what I would not have hit
260 , I can watch you for telling 261 how I took the blow, unless it
swell 262 past hiding, and then it’s past watching 263 .</p>
<p>Enter [Troilus’ ] Boy 264</p>
<p>PANDARUS You are such another 265 !</p>
<p>BOY Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Where?</p>
<p>BOY At your own house.</p>
<p>PANDARUS Good boy, tell him I come.</p>
<p>[Exit Boy ]</p>
<p>I doubt 266 he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA Adieu, uncle.</p>
<p>PANDARUS I’ll be with you, niece, by and by 267 .</p>
<p>CRESSIDA To bring 268 , uncle?</p>
<p>PANDARUS Ay, a token 269 from Troilus.</p>
<p>CRESSIDA By the same token 270 , you are a bawd 271 .</p>
<p>Exit Pandarus</p>
<p>Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love’s full sacrifice,</p>
<p>He offers in another’s enterprise 272 ,</p>
<p>But more in Troilus thousand-fold I see</p>
<p>Than in the glass 273 of Pandar’s praise may be;</p>
<p>Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing 274 :</p>
<p>Things won are done 275 , joy’s soul lies in the doing.</p>
<p>That she 276 beloved knows nought that knows not this:</p>
<p>Men prize the thing ungained more than it is 277 :</p>
<p>That she was never yet that ever knew</p>
<p>Love got so sweet as when desire did sue 278 .</p>
<p>Therefore this maxim out of 279 love I teach:</p>
<p>‘Achievement is command; ungained, beseech 280 .’</p>
<p>That 281 though my heart’s contents firm love doth bear 282 ,</p>
<p>Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.</p>
<p>Exit [with Alexander ]</p>
