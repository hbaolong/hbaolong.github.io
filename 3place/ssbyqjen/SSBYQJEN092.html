<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-14">Scene 1 ／ running scene 14</h4>
<p>Enter Duke [in his own habit ], Varrius, Lords, Angelo, Escalus,
Lucio, [and ] Citizens, at several doors</p>
<p>DUKE My very worthy cousin 1354 , fairly met! —</p>
<p>To Angelo</p>
<p>Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.</p>
<p>To Escalus</p>
<p>ANGELO and ESCALUS Happy return be to your royal grace!</p>
<p>DUKE Many and hearty thankings to you both.</p>
<p>We have made inquiry of you, and we hear</p>
<p>Such goodness of your justice that our soul</p>
<p>Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks 1355 ,</p>
<p>Forerunning more requital 1356 .</p>
<p>ANGELO You make my bonds 1357 still greater.</p>
<p>DUKE O, your desert speaks loud, and I should wrong it</p>
<p>To lock it in the wards of covert bosom 1358 ,</p>
<p>When it deserves with characters 1359 of brass</p>
<p>A forted 1360 residence ’gainst the tooth 1361 of time</p>
<p>And razure 1362 of oblivion. Give me your hand,</p>
<p>And let the subject 1363 see, to make them know</p>
<p>That outward courtesies would fain 1364 proclaim</p>
<p>Favours 1365 that keep within 1366 . Come, Escalus,</p>
<p>You must walk by us on our other hand,</p>
<p>And good supporters are you.</p>
<p>Enter [Friar ] Peter and Isabella</p>
<p>FRIAR PETER Now is your time. Speak loud and kneel before him.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard 1367</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>Upon a wronged — I would fain 1368 have said, a maid.</p>
<p>O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye</p>
<p>By throwing it on any other object</p>
<p>Till you have heard me in my true complaint</p>
<p>And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!</p>
<p>DUKE Relate your wrongs: in what, by whom? Be brief.</p>
<p>Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice,</p>
<p>Reveal 1369 yourself to him.</p>
<p>ISABELLA O worthy duke,</p>
<p>You bid me seek redemption of the devil.</p>
<p>Hear me yourself, for that which I must speak</p>
<p>Must either punish me, not being believed,</p>
<p>Or wring 1370 redress from you. Hear me, O, hear me here!</p>
<p>ANGELO My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm.</p>
<p>She hath been a suitor 1371 to me for her brother</p>
<p>Cut off 1372 by course of justice—</p>
<p>ISABELLA By course of justice!</p>
<p>ANGELO And she will speak most bitterly and strange 1373 .</p>
<p>ISABELLA Most strange, but yet most truly will I speak.</p>
<p>That Angelo’s forsworn 1374 , is it not strange?</p>
<p>That Angelo’s a murderer, is’t not strange?</p>
<p>That Angelo is an adulterous thief,</p>
<p>An hypocrite, a virgin-violator,</p>
<p>Is it not strange and strange?</p>
<p>DUKE Nay, it is ten times strange.</p>
<p>ISABELLA It is not truer 1375 he is Angelo</p>
<p>Than this is all as true as it is strange;</p>
<p>Nay, it is ten times true, for truth is truth</p>
<p>To th’end of reck’ning 1376 .</p>
<p>DUKE Away with her. Poor soul,</p>
<p>She speaks this in th’infirmity of sense 1377 .</p>
<p>ISABELLA O prince, I conjure 1378 thee, as thou believ’st</p>
<p>There is another comfort 1379 than this world,</p>
<p>That thou neglect me not with that opinion 1380</p>
<p>That I am touched 1381 with madness. Make not impossible</p>
<p>That which but seems unlike 1382 . ’Tis not impossible</p>
<p>But one, the wicked’st caitiff 1383 on the ground 1384 ,</p>
<p>May seem as shy 1385 , as grave 1386 , as just, as absolute 1387</p>
<p>As Angelo: even so may Angelo,</p>
<p>In all his dressings 1388 , caracts 1389 , titles, forms 1390 ,</p>
<p>Be an arch-villain. Believe it, royal prince:</p>
<p>If he be less, he’s nothing, but he’s more,</p>
<p>Had I more name 1391 for badness.</p>
<p>DUKE By mine honesty,</p>
<p>If she be mad — as I believe no other —</p>
<p>Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense 1392 ,</p>
<p>Such a dependency of thing 1393 on thing,</p>
<p>As e’er I heard in madness.</p>
<p>ISABELLA O gracious duke,</p>
<p>Harp 1394 not on that, nor do not banish reason</p>
<p>For inequality 1395 , but let your reason serve</p>
<p>To make the truth appear where it seems hid,</p>
<p>And hide the false seems true 1396 .</p>
<p>DUKE Many that are not mad</p>
<p>Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?</p>
<p>ISABELLA I am the sister of one Claudio,</p>
<p>Condemned upon the act 1397 of fornication</p>
<p>To lose his head, condemned by Angelo.</p>
<p>I, in probation of a sisterhood 1398 ,</p>
<p>Was sent to by my brother, one Lucio</p>
<p>As then 1399 the messenger—</p>
<p>LUCIO That’s I, an’t like your grace.</p>
<p>I came to her from Claudio, and desired her</p>
<p>To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo</p>
<p>For her poor brother’s pardon.</p>
<p>ISABELLA That’s he indeed.</p>
<p>DUKE You were not bid to speak.</p>
<p>LUCIO No, my good lord,</p>
<p>Nor wished 1400 to hold my peace.</p>
<p>DUKE I wish you now, then.</p>
<p>Pray you take note of it. And when you have</p>
<p>A business for yourself 1401 , pray heaven you then</p>
<p>Be perfect 1402 .</p>
<p>LUCIO I warrant 1403 your honour.</p>
<p>DUKE The warrant’s for yourself: take heed to’t.</p>
<p>ISABELLA This gentleman told somewhat 1404 of my tale—</p>
<p>LUCIO Right.</p>
<p>DUKE It may be right, but you are i’the wrong</p>
<p>To speak before your time.— Proceed.</p>
<p>ISABELLA I went</p>
<p>To this pernicious 1405 caitiff deputy—</p>
<p>DUKE That’s somewhat madly spoken.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Pardon it,</p>
<p>The phrase is to the matter 1406 .</p>
<p>DUKE Mended 1407 again. The matter: proceed.</p>
<p>ISABELLA In brief, to set the needless process by 1408 —</p>
<p>How I persuaded 1409 , how I prayed and kneeled,</p>
<p>How he refelled 1410 me, and how I replied,</p>
<p>For this was of much length — the vile conclusion</p>
<p>I now begin with grief and shame to utter.</p>
<p>He would not, but by gift of my chaste body</p>
<p>To his concupiscible 1411 intemperate lust</p>
<p>Release my brother. And after much debatement 1412</p>
<p>My sisterly remorse 1413 confutes 1414 mine honour,</p>
<p>And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes 1415 ,</p>
<p>His purpose surfeiting 1416 , he sends a warrant</p>
<p>For my poor brother’s head.</p>
<p>DUKE This is most likely 1417 .</p>
<p>ISABELLA O, that it were as like as it is true 1418 !</p>
<p>DUKE By heaven, fond 1419 wretch, thou know’st not what thou
speak’st,</p>
<p>Or else thou art suborned 1420 against his honour</p>
<p>In hateful practice 1421 . First, his integrity</p>
<p>Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason 1422</p>
<p>That with such vehemency he should pursue</p>
<p>Faults proper to himself 1423 . If he had so offended,</p>
<p>He would have weighed 1424 thy brother by himself,</p>
<p>And not have cut him off 1425 . Someone hath set you on 1426 .</p>
<p>Confess the truth, and say by whose advice</p>
<p>Thou cam’st here to complain.</p>
<p>ISABELLA And is this all?</p>
<p>Then, O you blessèd ministers 1427 above,</p>
<p>Keep me in patience, and with ripened time</p>
<p>Unfold 1428 the evil which is here wrapt up</p>
<p>In countenance 1429 ! Heaven shield your grace from woe,</p>
<p>As I, thus wronged, hence unbelievèd go!</p>
<p>She starts to go</p>
<p>DUKE I know you’d fain be gone. An officer!</p>
<p>To prison with her. Shall we thus permit</p>
<p>Isabella is arrested</p>
<p>A blasting 1430 and a scandalous breath to fall</p>
<p>On him so near us? This needs must be a practice 1431 .</p>
<p>Who knew of your intent and coming hither?</p>
<p>ISABELLA One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick 1432 .</p>
<p>DUKE A ghostly 1433 father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?</p>
<p>LUCIO My lord, I know him, ’tis a meddling friar,</p>
<p>I do not like the man. Had he been lay 1434 , my lord,</p>
<p>For certain words he spake against your grace</p>
<p>In your retirement 1435 , I had swinged 1436 him soundly.</p>
<p>DUKE Words against me? This’ 1437 a good friar, belike.</p>
<p>And to set on this wretched woman here</p>
<p>Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.</p>
<p>LUCIO But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,</p>
<p>I saw them at the prison: a saucy 1438 friar,</p>
<p>A very scurvy 1439 fellow.</p>
<p>FRIAR PETER Blessèd be your royal grace.</p>
<p>I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard</p>
<p>Your royal ear abused 1440 . First, hath this woman</p>
<p>Most wrongfully accused your substitute,</p>
<p>Who is as free from touch or soil 1441 with her</p>
<p>As she from one ungot 1442 .</p>
<p>DUKE We did believe no less.</p>
<p>Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?</p>
<p>FRIAR PETER I know him for a man divine and holy,</p>
<p>Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler 1443 ,</p>
<p>As he’s reported by this gentleman.</p>
<p>And on my trust a man that never yet</p>
<p>Did, as he vouches 1444 , misreport 1445 your grace.</p>
<p>LUCIO My lord, most villainously 1446 , believe it.</p>
<p>FRIAR PETER Well, he in time may come to clear himself,</p>
<p>But at this instant he is sick, my lord,</p>
<p>Of a strange 1447 fever. Upon his mere 1448 request,</p>
<p>Being come to knowledge that there was complaint</p>
<p>Intended ’gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,</p>
<p>To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know</p>
<p>Is true and false, and what he with his oath</p>
<p>And all probation 1449 will make up full clear 1450 ,</p>
<p>Whensoever he’s convented 1451 . First, for this woman.</p>
<p>To justify 1452 this worthy nobleman</p>
<p>So vulgarly 1453 and personally accused,</p>
<p>Her shall you hear disprovèd to her eyes 1454 ,</p>
<p>Till she herself confess it.</p>
<p>DUKE Good friar, let’s hear it.</p>
<p>[Exit Isabella, guarded ]</p>
<p>Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?</p>
<p>O heaven, the vanity 1455 of wretched fools!</p>
<p>Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo,</p>
<p>In this I’ll be impartial: be you judge</p>
<p>Of your own cause.</p>
<p>Enter Mariana [veiled ]</p>
<p>Is this the witness, friar?</p>
<p>First, let her show her face, and after speak.</p>
<p>MARIANA Pardon, my lord, I will not show my face</p>
<p>Kneels?</p>
<p>Until my husband bid me.</p>
<p>DUKE What, are you married?</p>
<p>MARIANA No, my lord.</p>
<p>DUKE Are you a maid?</p>
<p>MARIANA No, my lord.</p>
<p>DUKE A widow, then?</p>
<p>MARIANA Neither, my lord.</p>
<p>DUKE Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?</p>
<p>LUCIO My lord, she may be a punk 1456 , for many of them are neither
maid, widow, nor wife.</p>
<p>DUKE Silence that fellow. I would he had some cause</p>
<p>To prattle for himself 1457 .</p>
<p>LUCIO Well, my lord.</p>
<p>MARIANA My lord, I do confess I ne’er was married,</p>
<p>And I confess besides I am no maid.</p>
<p>I have known 1458 my husband, yet my husband</p>
<p>Knows not that ever he knew me.</p>
<p>LUCIO He was drunk then, my lord, it can be no better.</p>
<p>DUKE For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too 1459 .</p>
<p>LUCIO Well, my lord.</p>
<p>DUKE This is no witness for Lord Angelo.</p>
<p>MARIANA Now I come to’t, my lord.</p>
<p>She that accuses him of fornication,</p>
<p>In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,</p>
<p>And charges 1460 him, my lord, with 1461 such a time</p>
<p>When I’ll depose 1462 I had him in mine arms</p>
<p>With all th’effect 1463 of love.</p>
<p>ANGELO Charges she more 1464 than me?</p>
<p>MARIANA Not that I know.</p>
<p>DUKE No? You say your husband.</p>
<p>MARIANA Why, just 1465 , my lord, and that is Angelo,</p>
<p>Who thinks he knows that he ne’er knew my body,</p>
<p>But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel’s.</p>
<p>ANGELO This is a strange abuse 1466 . Let’s see thy face.</p>
<p>MARIANA My husband bids me, now I will unmask.</p>
<p>Unveils</p>
<p>This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,</p>
<p>Which once thou swor’st was worth the looking on:</p>
<p>This is the hand which, with a vowed contract,</p>
<p>Was fast belocked 1467 in thine: this is the body</p>
<p>That took away the match 1468 from Isabel,</p>
<p>And did supply 1469 thee at thy garden-house 1470</p>
<p>In her imagined person 1471 .</p>
<p>DUKE Know you this woman?</p>
<p>LUCIO Carnally, she says.</p>
<p>DUKE Sirrah, no more!</p>
<p>LUCIO Enough, my lord.</p>
<p>ANGELO My lord, I must confess I know this woman,</p>
<p>And five years since there was some speech of marriage</p>
<p>Betwixt myself and her, which was broke off,</p>
<p>Partly for that her promised proportions 1472</p>
<p>Came short of composition 1473 , but in chief 1474</p>
<p>For that 1475 her reputation was disvalued</p>
<p>In levity 1476 . Since which time of five years</p>
<p>I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,</p>
<p>Upon my faith and honour.</p>
<p>MARIANA Noble prince,</p>
<p>Kneels?</p>
<p>As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,</p>
<p>As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,</p>
<p>I am affianced this man’s wife as strongly</p>
<p>As words could make up vows. And, my good lord,</p>
<p>But Tuesday night last gone in’s garden-house</p>
<p>He knew me as a wife. As this is true,</p>
<p>Let me in safety raise me from my knees,</p>
<p>Or else forever be confixèd 1477 here,</p>
<p>A marble monument!</p>
<p>ANGELO I did but smile 1478 till now.</p>
<p>Now, good my lord, give me the scope 1479 of justice,</p>
<p>My patience here is touched 1480 . I do perceive</p>
<p>These poor informal 1481 women are no more</p>
<p>But instruments of some more mightier member 1482</p>
<p>That sets them on. Let me have way 1483 , my lord,</p>
<p>To find this practice out.</p>
<p>DUKE Ay, with my heart</p>
<p>And punish them to your height of pleasure.</p>
<p>Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,</p>
<p>Compact 1484 with her that’s gone, think’st thou thy oaths,</p>
<p>Though they would swear down 1485 each particular 1486 saint,</p>
<p>Were testimonies against his worth and credit</p>
<p>That’s sealed in approbation 1487 ? You, Lord Escalus,</p>
<p>Sit with my cousin, lend him your kind pains 1488</p>
<p>To find out this abuse, whence ’tis derived.</p>
<p>There is another friar that set them on,</p>
<p>Let him be sent for.</p>
<p>Duke gets up and Escalus takes his seat</p>
<p>FRIAR PETER Would he were here, my lord, for he indeed</p>
<p>Hath set the women on to this complaint.</p>
<p>Your provost knows the place where he abides,</p>
<p>And he may fetch him.</p>
<p>DUKE Go do it instantly.</p>
<p>[Exit Provost ]</p>
<p>And you, my noble and well-warranted 1489 cousin,</p>
<p>Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth 1490 ,</p>
<p>Do with your injuries as seems you best</p>
<p>In any chastisement 1491 . I for a while</p>
<p>Will leave you, but stir not you 1492 till you have</p>
<p>Well determined 1493 upon these slanderers.</p>
<p>ESCALUS My lord, we’ll do it throughly 1494 .</p>
<p>Exit [Duke ]</p>
<p>Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be a
dishonest person?</p>
<p>LUCIO Cucullus non facit monachum 1495 : honest in nothing but in his
clothes, and one that hath spoke most villainous speeches of the
duke.</p>
<p>ESCALUS We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and enforce
them against him 1496 . We shall find this friar a notable 1497
fellow.</p>
<p>LUCIO As any in Vienna, on my word.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Call that same Isabel here once again, I would speak with
her.</p>
<p>Exit an Attendant</p>
<p>Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question, you shall see how I’ll
handle 1498 her.</p>
<p>To Angelo</p>
<p>LUCIO Not better than he, by her own report.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Say you? 1499</p>
<p>LUCIO Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately 1500 , she
would sooner confess, perchance publicly she’ll be ashamed 1501 .</p>
<p>Enter Duke [in his friar’s disguise ], Provost, Isabella [and
Officers ]</p>
<p>ESCALUS I will go darkly to work with her 1502 .</p>
<p>LUCIO That’s the way, for women are light 1503 at midnight.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Come on, mistress, here’s a gentlewoman denies all that you
have said.</p>
<p>LUCIO My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of, here with the
provost.</p>
<p>ESCALUS In very good time. Speak not you to him till we call upon
you.</p>
<p>LUCIO Mum 1504 .</p>
<p>ESCALUS Come, sir, did you set these women on to slander Lord Angelo?
They have confessed you did.</p>
<p>DUKE ’Tis false.</p>
<p>ESCALUS How? 1505 Know you where you are?</p>
<p>DUKE Respect 1506 to your great place, and let the devil</p>
<p>Be sometime honoured for his burning throne 1507 .</p>
<p>Where is the duke? ’Tis he should hear me speak.</p>
<p>ESCALUS The duke’s in us 1508 , and we will hear you speak:</p>
<p>Look 1509 you speak justly.</p>
<p>DUKE Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,</p>
<p>Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?</p>
<p>Good night to your redress! 1510 Is the duke gone?</p>
<p>Then is your cause gone too. The duke’s unjust,</p>
<p>Thus to retort 1511 your manifest 1512 appeal,</p>
<p>And put your trial in the villain’s mouth</p>
<p>Which here you come to accuse.</p>
<p>LUCIO This is the rascal, this is he I spoke of.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Why, thou unreverend 1513 and unhallowed 1514 friar,</p>
<p>Is’t not enough thou hast suborned these women</p>
<p>To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth 1515</p>
<p>And in the witness of his proper ear 1516 ,</p>
<p>To call him villain, and then to glance 1517 from him</p>
<p>To th’duke himself, to tax 1518 him with injustice?</p>
<p>Take him hence, to th’rack 1519 with him! We’ll touse 1520 you</p>
<p>Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.</p>
<p>What? Unjust?</p>
<p>DUKE Be not so hot 1521 . The duke dare</p>
<p>No more stretch 1522 this finger of mine than he</p>
<p>Dare rack his own. His subject am I not,</p>
<p>Nor here provincial 1523 . My business in this state</p>
<p>Made me a looker-on here in Vienna,</p>
<p>Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble</p>
<p>Till it o’errun the stew 1524 : laws for all faults,</p>
<p>But faults so countenanced 1525 that the strong statutes</p>
<p>Stand like the forfeits in a barber’s shop 1526 ,</p>
<p>As much in mock as mark 1527 .</p>
<p>ESCALUS Slander to th’state! Away with him to prison!</p>
<p>ANGELO What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?</p>
<p>Is this the man that you did tell us of?</p>
<p>LUCIO ’Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman 1528 baldpate 1529 . Do
you know me?</p>
<p>DUKE I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at
the prison, in the absence of the duke.</p>
<p>LUCIO O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the
duke?</p>
<p>DUKE Most notedly 1530 , sir.</p>
<p>LUCIO Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger 1531 , a fool,
and a coward, as you then report 1532 ed him to be?</p>
<p>DUKE You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make that my
report: you indeed spoke so of him, and much more, much worse.</p>
<p>LUCIO O thou damnable fellow, did not I pluck thee by the nose for
thy speeches?</p>
<p>DUKE I protest I love the duke as I love myself.</p>
<p>ANGELO Hark, how the villain would close 1533 now, after his
treasonable abuses.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with him to
prison. Where is the provost? Away with him to prison. Lay bolts 1534
enough upon him. Let him speak no more. Away with those giglots 1535
too, and with the other confederate companion 1536 !</p>
<p>Provost lays hands</p>
<p>on the Duke</p>
<p>DUKE Stay, sir, stay awhile.</p>
<p>To Provost</p>
<p>ANGELO What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.</p>
<p>LUCIO Come, sir, come, sir, come, sir. Foh, sir! Why, you bald-pated,
lying rascal, you must be hooded, must you? Show your knave’s visage,
with a pox to you: show your sheep-biting 1537 face, and be hanged 1538
an hour 1539 ! Will’t not off?</p>
<p>Lucio pulls off the friar’s hood</p>
<p>and discovers theDuke;</p>
<p>all rise</p>
<p>DUKE Thou art the first knave that e’er mad’st 1540 a duke.—</p>
<p>First, provost, let me bail 1541 these gentle three 1542 .—</p>
<p>Sneak not away, sir, for the friar and you</p>
<p>To Lucio</p>
<p>Must have a word anon.— Lay hold on him.</p>
<p>Lucio is arrested</p>
<p>LUCIO This may prove worse than hanging.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>DUKE What you have spoke I pardon. Sit you down,</p>
<p>To Escalus</p>
<p>We’ll borrow place 1543 of him.—</p>
<p>Sir, by your leave.</p>
<p>To Angelo, whose seat he takes</p>
<p>Hast thou or 1544 word or wit or impudence</p>
<p>That yet can do thee office 1545 ? If thou hast,</p>
<p>Rely upon it till my tale be heard,</p>
<p>And hold no longer out 1546 .</p>
<p>ANGELO O, my dread 1547 lord,</p>
<p>I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,</p>
<p>To think I can be undiscernible 1548 ,</p>
<p>When I perceive your grace, like power divine,</p>
<p>Hath looked upon my passes 1549 . Then, good prince,</p>
<p>No longer session 1550 hold upon my shame,</p>
<p>But let my trial be mine own confession:</p>
<p>Immediate sentence then and sequent 1551 death</p>
<p>Is all the grace I beg.</p>
<p>DUKE Come hither, Mariana.—</p>
<p>Say: wast thou e’er contracted to this woman?</p>
<p>To Angelo</p>
<p>ANGELO I was, my lord.</p>
<p>DUKE Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.—</p>
<p>Do you the office 1552 , friar, which consummate 1553 ,</p>
<p>Return him here again.— Go with him, provost.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter and Provost ]</p>
<p>ESCALUS My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour</p>
<p>Than at the strangeness of it 1554 .</p>
<p>DUKE Come hither, Isabel.</p>
<p>Your friar is now your prince. As I was then</p>
<p>Advertising 1555 and holy 1556 to your business,</p>
<p>Not changing heart with habit 1557 , I am still</p>
<p>Attorneyed 1558 at your service.</p>
<p>ISABELLA O give me pardon</p>
<p>That I, your vassal 1559 , have employed and pained 1560</p>
<p>Your unknown sovereignty.</p>
<p>DUKE You are pardoned, Isabel:</p>
<p>And now, dear maid, be you as free 1561 to us.</p>
<p>Your brother’s death, I know, sits at your heart,</p>
<p>And you may marvel why I obscured 1562 myself,</p>
<p>Labouring to save his life, and would not rather</p>
<p>Make rash remonstrance 1563 of my hidden power</p>
<p>Than let him so be lost 1564 . O most kind 1565 maid,</p>
<p>It was the swift celerity 1566 of his death,</p>
<p>Which I did think with slower foot came on,</p>
<p>That brained 1567 my purpose. But, peace be with him.</p>
<p>That life is better life, past fearing death,</p>
<p>Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort,</p>
<p>So 1568 happy is your brother.</p>
<p>ISABELLA I do, my lord.</p>
<p>Enter Angelo, Mariana, [Friar ] Peter [and ] Provost</p>
<p>DUKE For this new-married man approaching here,</p>
<p>Whose salt 1569 imagination yet hath wronged</p>
<p>Your well defended honour, you must pardon</p>
<p>For Mariana’s sake. But as he adjudged 1570 your brother,</p>
<p>Being criminal, in double violation</p>
<p>Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach</p>
<p>Thereon dependent 1571 for your brother’s life,</p>
<p>The very mercy of the law cries out</p>
<p>Most audible, even from his proper 1572 tongue,</p>
<p>‘An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!’</p>
<p>Haste still 1573 pays haste, and leisure answers leisure,</p>
<p>Like doth quit 1574 like, and measure 1575 still for measure.</p>
<p>Then, Angelo, thy fault’s thus manifested,</p>
<p>Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage 1576 .</p>
<p>We do condemn thee to the very block 1577</p>
<p>Where Claudio stooped to death, and with like haste.</p>
<p>Away with him!</p>
<p>MARIANA O my most gracious lord,</p>
<p>I hope you will not mock 1578 me with a husband.</p>
<p>DUKE It is your husband mocked you with a husband.</p>
<p>Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,</p>
<p>I thought your marriage fit, else imputation,</p>
<p>For that he knew you 1579 , might reproach your life</p>
<p>And choke your good to come. For 1580 his possessions,</p>
<p>Although by confiscation they are ours,</p>
<p>We do instate 1581 and widow you withal 1582 ,</p>
<p>To buy you a better husband.</p>
<p>MARIANA O my dear lord,</p>
<p>I crave no other, nor no better man.</p>
<p>DUKE Never crave him, we are definitive 1583 .</p>
<p>MARIANA Gentle my liege—</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>DUKE You do but lose your labour 1584 .</p>
<p>Away with him to death.— Now, sir, to you.</p>
<p>To Lucio</p>
<p>MARIANA O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part,</p>
<p>Lend me your knees, and all my life to come</p>
<p>I’ll lend you all my life to do you service.</p>
<p>DUKE Against all sense 1585 you do importune 1586 her.</p>
<p>Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact 1587 ,</p>
<p>Her brother’s ghost his pavèd bed 1588 would break,</p>
<p>And take her hence in horror.</p>
<p>MARIANA Isabel,</p>
<p>Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me,</p>
<p>Hold up your hands, say nothing, I’ll speak all.</p>
<p>They say best men are moulded out of faults,</p>
<p>And for the most 1589 become much more the better</p>
<p>For being a little bad: so may my husband.</p>
<p>O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?</p>
<p>DUKE He dies for Claudio’s death.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Most bounteous sir,</p>
<p>Look, if it please you, on this man condemned,</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>As if my brother lived. I partly think</p>
<p>A due sincerity governed his deeds,</p>
<p>Till he did look on me: since it is so,</p>
<p>Let him not die. My brother had but 1590 justice,</p>
<p>In that he did the thing for which he died.</p>
<p>For Angelo,</p>
<p>His act did not o’ertake his bad intent 1591 ,</p>
<p>And must be buried but as an intent</p>
<p>That perished by the way. Thoughts are no subjects 1592 ,</p>
<p>Intents but merely thoughts.</p>
<p>MARIANA Merely, my lord.</p>
<p>DUKE Your suit’s unprofitable 1593 . Stand up, I say.</p>
<p>They stand</p>
<p>I have bethought me of another fault.</p>
<p>Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded</p>
<p>At an unusual hour?</p>
<p>PROVOST It was commanded so.</p>
<p>DUKE Had you a special warrant for the deed?</p>
<p>PROVOST No, my good lord, it was by private message.</p>
<p>DUKE For which I do discharge you of your office.</p>
<p>Give up your keys.</p>
<p>PROVOST Pardon me, noble lord,</p>
<p>I thought it was a fault, but knew it not 1594 ,</p>
<p>Yet did repent me after more advice 1595 ,</p>
<p>For testimony whereof, one in the prison,</p>
<p>That should by private order else have died,</p>
<p>I have reserved 1596 alive.</p>
<p>DUKE What’s he?</p>
<p>PROVOST His name is Barnardine.</p>
<p>DUKE I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.</p>
<p>Go fetch him hither, let me look upon him.</p>
<p>[Exit Provost ]</p>
<p>ESCALUS I am sorry, one so learnèd and so wise</p>
<p>As you, Lord Angelo, have still 1597 appeared,</p>
<p>Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood 1598</p>
<p>And lack of tempered 1599 judgement afterward.</p>
<p>ANGELO I am sorry that such sorrow I procure 1600 ,</p>
<p>And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart</p>
<p>That I crave death more willingly than mercy,</p>
<p>’Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.</p>
<p>Enter Provost, Barnardine, Claudio [muffled, and ] Julietta</p>
<p>DUKE Which is that Barnardine?</p>
<p>PROVOST This, my lord.</p>
<p>DUKE There was a friar told me of this man.</p>
<p>Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul</p>
<p>That apprehends 1601 no further than this world,</p>
<p>And squar’st 1602 thy life according. Thou’rt condemned,</p>
<p>But, for those earthly faults, I quit 1603 them all,</p>
<p>And pray thee take this mercy to provide</p>
<p>For better times to come. Friar, advise him,</p>
<p>I leave him to your hand. What muffled 1604 fellow’s that?</p>
<p>PROVOST This is another prisoner that I saved,</p>
<p>Who should have died when Claudio lost his head,</p>
<p>As like almost to Claudio as himself.</p>
<p>Unmuffles Claudio</p>
<p>DUKE If he be like your brother, for his sake</p>
<p>To Isabella</p>
<p>Is he pardoned. And, for your lovely sake,</p>
<p>Give me your hand and say you will be mine,</p>
<p>He is my brother too. But fitter time for that.</p>
<p>By this Lord Angelo perceives he’s safe,</p>
<p>Methinks I see a quickening 1605 in his eye.</p>
<p>Well, Angelo, your evil quits 1606 you well:</p>
<p>Look 1607 that you love your wife, her worth worth yours 1608 .</p>
<p>I find an apt remission 1609 in myself.</p>
<p>And yet here’s one in place 1610 I cannot pardon.</p>
<p>You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,</p>
<p>To Lucio</p>
<p>One all of luxury 1611 , an ass, a madman —</p>
<p>Wherein have I so deserved of you,</p>
<p>That you extol 1612 me thus?</p>
<p>LUCIO ’Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the trick 1613 .
If you will hang me for it, you may, but I had rather it would please
you I might be whipped.</p>
<p>DUKE Whipped first, sir, and hanged after.</p>
<p>Proclaim it, provost, round about the city:</p>
<p>If any woman wronged by this lewd fellow —</p>
<p>As I have heard him swear himself there’s one</p>
<p>Whom he begot with child — let her appear,</p>
<p>And he shall marry her. The nuptial finished,</p>
<p>Let him be whipped and hanged.</p>
<p>LUCIO I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore. Your
highness said even now, I made you a duke. Good my lord, do not
recompense me in making me a cuckold 1614 .</p>
<p>DUKE Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.</p>
<p>Thy slanders I forgive, and therewithal 1615</p>
<p>Remit 1616 thy other forfeits 1617 . Take him to prison,</p>
<p>And see our pleasure herein executed 1618 .</p>
<p>LUCIO Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death 1619 , whipping,
and hanging.</p>
<p>DUKE Slandering a prince deserves it.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Officers with Lucio ]</p>
<p>She, Claudio, that you wronged, look you restore 1620 .</p>
<p>Joy to you, Mariana. Love her, Angelo:</p>
<p>I have confessed her 1621 and I know her virtue.</p>
<p>Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness,</p>
<p>There’s more behind 1622 that is more gratulate 1623 .</p>
<p>Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy,</p>
<p>We shall employ thee in a worthier place.</p>
<p>Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home</p>
<p>The head of Ragozine for Claudio’s,</p>
<p>Th’offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,</p>
<p>I have a motion much imports your good 1624 ,</p>
<p>Whereto if you’ll a willing ear incline,</p>
<p>What’s mine is yours and what is yours is mine.</p>
<p>So, bring 1625 us to our palace, where we’ll show</p>
<p>What’s yet behind 1626 , that’s meet 1627 you all should know.</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header - our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster , and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268-81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address - it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ‘bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading ‘bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information - for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
