<h4 id="scene-2-854-running-scene-9">Scene 2 854 / running scene 9</h4>
<p>Drum. Enter Brutus, Lucilius and the army. Titinius and Pindarus meet
them</p>
<p>BRUTUS Stand ho 855 .</p>
<p>LUCILIUS Give the word, ho 856 , and stand.</p>
<p>BRUTUS What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?</p>
<p>LUCILIUS He is at hand, and Pindarus is come</p>
<p>To do you salutation from his master 857 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,</p>
<p>In his own change 858 , or by ill officers 859 ,</p>
<p>Hath given me some worthy 860 cause to wish</p>
<p>Things done, undone: but if he be at hand</p>
<p>I shall be satisfied 861 .</p>
<p>PINDARUS I do not doubt</p>
<p>But that my noble master will appear</p>
<p>Such as he is, full of regard 862 and honour.</p>
<p>BRUTUS He is not doubted.— A word, Lucilius.</p>
<p>Brutus and Lucilius speak apart</p>
<p>How he 863 received you: let me be resolved 864 .</p>
<p>LUCILIUS With courtesy and with respect enough,</p>
<p>But not with such familiar instances 865 ,</p>
<p>Nor with such free and friendly conference 866</p>
<p>As he hath used of old.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Thou hast described</p>
<p>A hot 867 friend, cooling: ever 868 note, Lucilius,</p>
<p>When love begins to sicken and decay</p>
<p>It useth an enforced ceremony 869 .</p>
<p>There are no tricks in plain and simple faith:</p>
<p>But hollow 870 men, like horses hot at hand 871 ,</p>
<p>Make gallant 872 show, and promise of their mettle 873 :</p>
<p>Low march 874 within</p>
<p>But when they should endure the bloody 875 spur,</p>
<p>They fall 876 their crests 877 , and like deceitful jades 878</p>
<p>Sink in the trial 879 . Comes his army on?</p>
<p>LUCILIUS They mean this night in Sardis to be quartered 880 :</p>
<p>The greater part, the horse in general 881 ,</p>
<p>Are come with Cassius.</p>
<p>Enter Cassius and his powers 882</p>
<p>BRUTUS Hark, he is arrived:</p>
<p>March gently 883 on to meet him.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Stand ho.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Stand ho. Speak the word along.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER Stand.</p>
<p>SECOND SOLDIER Stand.</p>
<p>THIRD SOLDIER Stand.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Most noble brother 884 , you have done me wrong.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Judge me, you gods; wrong I mine enemies?</p>
<p>And if not so, how should 885 I wrong a brother?</p>
<p>CASSIUS Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,</p>
<p>And when you do them—</p>
<p>BRUTUS Cassius, be content.</p>
<p>Speak your griefs 886 softly. I do know you well:</p>
<p>Before the eyes of both our armies here —</p>
<p>Which should perceive nothing but love from us —</p>
<p>Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away:</p>
<p>Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge 887 your griefs,</p>
<p>And I will give you audience 888 .</p>
<p>CASSIUS Pindarus,</p>
<p>Bid our commanders lead their charges 889 off 890</p>
<p>A little from this ground.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man</p>
<p>Come to our tent till we have done our conference.</p>
<p>Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.</p>
<p>Exeunt. Brutus and Cassius remain</p>
<p>CASSIUS That you have wronged me doth appear in this:</p>
<p>They enter the tent</p>
<p>You have condemned and noted 891 Lucius Pella</p>
<p>For taking bribes here of the Sardians;</p>
<p>Wherein my letters, praying 892 on his side</p>
<p>Because I knew the man, was slighted off 893 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS You wronged yourself to write in such a case.</p>
<p>CASSIUS In such a time as this it is not meet 894</p>
<p>That every nice 895 offence should bear his comment 896 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself</p>
<p>Are much condemned to have an itching palm 897 ,</p>
<p>To sell and mart 898 your offices 899 for gold</p>
<p>To undeservers.</p>
<p>CASSIUS I, an itching palm?</p>
<p>You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,</p>
<p>Or by the gods, this speech were else your last 900 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS The name of Cassius honours 901 this corruption,</p>
<p>And chastisement 902 doth therefore hide his head 903 .</p>
<p>CASSIUS Chastisement?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Remember March, the Ides of March remember:</p>
<p>Did not great Julius bleed for justice’ sake?</p>
<p>What villain touched his body, that did stab</p>
<p>And not for justice? What, shall one of us,</p>
<p>That struck the foremost man of all this world</p>
<p>But 904 for supporting robbers 905 : shall we now</p>
<p>Contaminate our fingers with base bribes?</p>
<p>And sell the mighty space of our large honours 906</p>
<p>For so much trash 907 as may be graspèd thus?</p>
<p>I had rather be a dog and bay 908 the moon,</p>
<p>Than such a Roman.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Brutus, bait not me,</p>
<p>I’ll not endure it: you forget yourself</p>
<p>To hedge me in 909 . I am a soldier, I,</p>
<p>Older in practice, abler than yourself</p>
<p>To make conditions 910 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS Go to 911 , you are not Cassius.</p>
<p>CASSIUS I am.</p>
<p>BRUTUS I say you are not.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Urge me no more, I shall forget myself 912 .</p>
<p>Have mind upon 913 your health: tempt me no further.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Away, slight 914 man!</p>
<p>CASSIUS Is’t possible?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Hear me, for I will speak.</p>
<p>Must I give way and room 915 to your rash choler 916 ?</p>
<p>Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?</p>
<p>CASSIUS O ye gods, ye gods, must I endure all this?</p>
<p>BRUTUS All this? Ay, more: fret till your proud heart break.</p>
<p>Go show your slaves how choleric you are,</p>
<p>And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge 917 ?</p>
<p>Must I observe 918 you? Must I stand and crouch 919</p>
<p>Under your testy humour 920 ? By the gods,</p>
<p>You shall digest 921 the venom of your spleen 922</p>
<p>Though it do split you. For, from this day forth,</p>
<p>I’ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,</p>
<p>When you are waspish.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Is it come to this?</p>
<p>BRUTUS You say you are a better soldier:</p>
<p>Let it appear so; make your vaunting 923 true</p>
<p>And it shall please me well. For mine own part,</p>
<p>I shall be glad to learn of 924 noble men.</p>
<p>CASSIUS You wrong me every way: you wrong me, Brutus.</p>
<p>I said, an elder soldier, not a better.</p>
<p>Did I say ‘better’?</p>
<p>BRUTUS If you did, I care not.</p>
<p>CASSIUS When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me 925 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS Peace, peace, you durst not so have tempted him.</p>
<p>CASSIUS I durst not?</p>
<p>BRUTUS No.</p>
<p>CASSIUS What? Durst not tempt him?</p>
<p>BRUTUS For your life you durst not.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Do not presume 926 too much upon my love:</p>
<p>I may do that I shall be sorry for.</p>
<p>BRUTUS You have done that you should be sorry for.</p>
<p>There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,</p>
<p>For I am armed so strong in honesty</p>
<p>That they pass by me as the idle 927 wind,</p>
<p>Which I respect not. I did send to you</p>
<p>For certain sums of gold, which you denied me,</p>
<p>For I can raise no money by vile means 928 :</p>
<p>By heaven, I had rather coin 929 my heart</p>
<p>And drop 930 my blood for drachmas 931 , than to wring</p>
<p>From the hard 932 hands of peasants their vile 933 trash</p>
<p>By any indirection 934 . I did send</p>
<p>To you for gold to pay my legions,</p>
<p>Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?</p>
<p>Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?</p>
<p>When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,</p>
<p>To lock such rascal counters 935 from his friends,</p>
<p>Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,</p>
<p>Dash him to pieces!</p>
<p>CASSIUS I denied you not.</p>
<p>BRUTUS You did.</p>
<p>CASSIUS I did not. He was but a fool that brought</p>
<p>My answer back. Brutus hath rived 936 my heart:</p>
<p>A friend should bear his friend’s infirmities 937 ;</p>
<p>But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.</p>
<p>BRUTUS I do not, till you practise them on me.</p>
<p>CASSIUS You love me not.</p>
<p>BRUTUS I do not like your faults.</p>
<p>CASSIUS A friendly eye could never see such faults.</p>
<p>BRUTUS A flatterer’s would not, though they do appear</p>
<p>As huge as high Olympus.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,</p>
<p>Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,</p>
<p>For Cassius is aweary of the world:</p>
<p>Hated by one he loves, braved 938 by his brother,</p>
<p>Checked 939 like a bondman, all his faults observed,</p>
<p>Set in a notebook, learned and conned by rote 940</p>
<p>To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep</p>
<p>My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,</p>
<p>And here my naked breast: within, a heart</p>
<p>Dearer 941 than Pluto 942 ’s mine 943 , richer than gold.</p>
<p>If that thou be’st a Roman, take it forth 944 .</p>
<p>I that denied thee gold will give my heart:</p>
<p>Strike as thou didst at Caesar, for I know,</p>
<p>When thou didst hate him worst, thou lov’dst him better</p>
<p>Than ever thou lov’dst Cassius.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Sheathe your dagger.</p>
<p>Be angry when you will, it shall have scope:</p>
<p>Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour 945 .</p>
<p>O Cassius, you are yokèd with a lamb 946</p>
<p>That carries anger as the flint bears fire,</p>
<p>Who, much enforcèd 947 , shows a hasty 948 spark</p>
<p>And straight is cold again.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Hath Cassius lived</p>
<p>To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,</p>
<p>When grief and blood ill-tempered 949 vexeth him?</p>
<p>BRUTUS When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.</p>
<p>BRUTUS And my heart too.</p>
<p>They embrace</p>
<p>CASSIUS O Brutus!</p>
<p>BRUTUS What’s the matter?</p>
<p>CASSIUS Have not you love enough to bear with me,</p>
<p>When that rash humour 950 which my mother gave me</p>
<p>Makes me forgetful 951 ?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth</p>
<p>When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,</p>
<p>He’ll think your mother chides, and leave you so 952 .</p>
<p>Enter a Poet [with Lucilius and Titinius ]</p>
<p>POET Let me go in to see the generals.</p>
<p>There is some grudge between ’em, ’tis not meet</p>
<p>They be alone.</p>
<p>LUCILIUS You shall not come to them.</p>
<p>POET Nothing but death shall stay me.</p>
<p>CASSIUS How now? What’s the matter?</p>
<p>POET For shame, you generals; what do you mean 953 ?</p>
<p>Love and be friends, as two such men should be,</p>
<p>For I have seen more years, I’m sure, than ye.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Ha, ha, how vilely doth this cynic 954 rhyme!</p>
<p>BRUTUS Get you hence, sirrah. Saucy 955 fellow, hence.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Bear with him, Brutus, ’tis his fashion 956 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS I’ll know his humour when he knows his time 957 :</p>
<p>What should the wars do with these jigging 958 fools?</p>
<p>Companion 959 , hence.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Away, away, be gone.</p>
<p>Exit Poet</p>
<p>BRUTUS Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders</p>
<p>Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.</p>
<p>CASSIUS And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you</p>
<p>Immediately to us.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius ]</p>
<p>BRUTUS Lucius, a bowl of 960 wine.</p>
<p>Calls</p>
<p>CASSIUS I did not think you could have been so angry.</p>
<p>BRUTUS O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Of your philosophy 961 you make no use,</p>
<p>If you give place 962 to accidental evils 963 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Ha? Portia?</p>
<p>BRUTUS She is dead.</p>
<p>CASSIUS How scaped 964 I killing when I crossed 965 you so?</p>
<p>O, insupportable and touching 966 loss!</p>
<p>Upon 967 what sickness?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Impatient of my absence,</p>
<p>And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony</p>
<p>Have made themselves so strong — for with her 968 death</p>
<p>That tidings 969 came — with this she fell distract 970 ,</p>
<p>And — her attendants absent — swallowed fire 971 .</p>
<p>CASSIUS And died so?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Even so.</p>
<p>CASSIUS O ye immortal gods!</p>
<p>Enter Boy [Lucius ] with wine and tapers</p>
<p>BRUTUS Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.</p>
<p>In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.</p>
<p>Drinks</p>
<p>CASSIUS My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.</p>
<p>Fill, Lucius, till the wine o’erswell 972 the cup:</p>
<p>Drinks</p>
<p>I cannot drink too much of Brutus’ love.</p>
<p>[Exit Lucius ]</p>
<p>Enter Titinius and Messala</p>
<p>BRUTUS Come in, Titinius. Welcome, good Messala.</p>
<p>Now sit we close about this taper here</p>
<p>And call in question 973 our necessities.</p>
<p>They sit</p>
<p>CASSIUS Portia, art thou gone?</p>
<p>BRUTUS No more, I pray you.—</p>
<p>Messala, I have here receivèd letters,</p>
<p>Shows letters</p>
<p>That young Octavius and Mark Antony</p>
<p>Come down upon us with a mighty power,</p>
<p>Bending 974 their expedition 975 toward Philippi 976 .</p>
<p>MESSALA Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor 977 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS With what addition?</p>
<p>MESSALA That by proscription and bills of outlawry 978 ,</p>
<p>Octavius, Antony and Lepidus</p>
<p>Have put to death an hundred senators.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Therein our letters do not well agree:</p>
<p>Mine speak of seventy senators that died</p>
<p>By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Cicero one?</p>
<p>MESSALA Cicero is dead,</p>
<p>And by that order of proscription.</p>
<p>Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?</p>
<p>BRUTUS No, Messala.</p>
<p>MESSALA Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Nothing, Messala.</p>
<p>MESSALA That, methinks, is strange.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?</p>
<p>MESSALA No, my lord.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.</p>
<p>MESSALA Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell,</p>
<p>For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Why, farewell, Portia: we must die, Messala:</p>
<p>With meditating that she must die once 979 ,</p>
<p>I have the patience to endure it now.</p>
<p>MESSALA Even so 980 great men great losses should endure.</p>
<p>CASSIUS I have as much of this in art 981 as you,</p>
<p>But yet my nature 982 could not bear it 983 so.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Well, to our work alive 984 . What do you think</p>
<p>Of marching to Philippi presently?</p>
<p>CASSIUS I do not think it good.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Your reason?</p>
<p>CASSIUS This it is:</p>
<p>’Tis better that the enemy seek us,</p>
<p>So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,</p>
<p>Doing himself offence 985 , whilst we, lying still,</p>
<p>Are full of rest, defence and nimbleness.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Good reasons must of force 986 give place 987 to better:</p>
<p>The people ’twixt Philippi and this ground</p>
<p>Do stand but in a forced affection 988 ,</p>
<p>For they have grudged us contribution 989 .</p>
<p>The enemy, marching along by them,</p>
<p>By them shall make a fuller number up 990 ,</p>
<p>Come on refreshed, new-added 991 and encouraged,</p>
<p>From which advantage shall we cut him off</p>
<p>If at Philippi we do face him there,</p>
<p>These people at our back 992 .</p>
<p>CASSIUS Hear me, good brother.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Under your pardon 993 . You must note beside</p>
<p>That we have tried 994 the utmost of our friends,</p>
<p>Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe.</p>
<p>The enemy increaseth every day:</p>
<p>We, at the height, are ready to decline.</p>
<p>There is a tide in the affairs of men</p>
<p>Which, taken at the flood 995 , leads on to fortune:</p>
<p>Omitted 996 , all the voyage of their life</p>
<p>Is bound in shallows 997 and in miseries.</p>
<p>On such a full sea are we now afloat,</p>
<p>And we must take the current when it serves,</p>
<p>Or lose our ventures 998 .</p>
<p>CASSIUS Then with your will go on:</p>
<p>We’ll along 999 ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.</p>
<p>BRUTUS The deep of night is crept upon our talk,</p>
<p>And nature must obey necessity,</p>
<p>Which we will niggard 1000 with a little rest.</p>
<p>There is no more to say.</p>
<p>CASSIUS No more. Goodnight.</p>
<p>Early tomorrow will we rise, and hence.</p>
<p>Enter Lucius</p>
<p>BRUTUS Lucius. My gown 1001 .—</p>
<p>[Exit Lucius ]</p>
<p>Farewell, good Messala.—</p>
<p>Goodnight, Titinius.— Noble, noble Cassius,</p>
<p>Goodnight, and good repose.</p>
<p>CASSIUS O my dear brother,</p>
<p>This was an ill beginning of the night:</p>
<p>Never come such division ’tween our souls.</p>
<p>Let it not, Brutus.</p>
<p>Enter Lucius with the gown</p>
<p>BRUTUS Everything is well.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Goodnight, my lord.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Goodnight, good brother.</p>
<p>TITINIUS and MESSALA Goodnight, Lord Brutus.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Farewell, every one.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Cassius, Titinius and Messala ]</p>
<p>Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument 1002 ?</p>
<p>LUCIUS Here in the tent.</p>
<p>BRUTUS What, thou speak’st drowsily?</p>
<p>Poor knave, I blame thee not: thou art o’er-watched 1003 .</p>
<p>Call Claudio and some other of my men.</p>
<p>I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Varrus and Claudio!</p>
<p>Calls</p>
<p>Enter Varrus and Claudio</p>
<p>VARRUS Calls my lord?</p>
<p>BRUTUS I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep.</p>
<p>It may be I shall raise 1004 you by and by</p>
<p>On business to my brother Cassius.</p>
<p>VARRUS So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure 1005
.</p>
<p>BRUTUS I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs,</p>
<p>It may be I shall otherwise bethink me 1006 .</p>
<p>They lie down</p>
<p>Look, Lucius, here’s the book I sought for so:</p>
<p>I put it in the pocket of my gown.</p>
<p>LUCIUS I was sure your lordship did not give it me.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.</p>
<p>Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile</p>
<p>And touch 1007 thy instrument a strain or two?</p>
<p>LUCIUS Ay, my lord, an’t 1008 please you.</p>
<p>BRUTUS It does, my boy.</p>
<p>I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.</p>
<p>LUCIUS It is my duty, sir.</p>
<p>BRUTUS I should not urge thy duty past thy might 1009 .</p>
<p>I know young bloods look for 1010 a time of rest.</p>
<p>LUCIUS I have slept, my lord, already.</p>
<p>BRUTUS It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again.</p>
<p>I will not hold 1011 thee long. If I do live,</p>
<p>I will be good to thee.</p>
<p>Music, and a song</p>
<p>Lucius falls asleep</p>
<p>This is a sleepy tune:— O murderous 1012 slumber!</p>
<p>Lay’st thou thy leaden mace 1013 upon my boy,</p>
<p>That plays thee music?— Gentle knave, goodnight.</p>
<p>I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:</p>
<p>If thou dost nod, thou break’st thy instrument,</p>
<p>I’ll take it from thee. And, good boy, goodnight.</p>
<p>Takes away the instrument and reads</p>
<p>Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turned down</p>
<p>Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.</p>
<p>Enter the Ghost of Caesar</p>
<p>How ill this taper burns. Ha? Who comes here?</p>
<p>I think it is the weakness of mine eyes</p>
<p>That shapes 1014 this monstrous 1015 apparition.</p>
<p>It comes upon me: art thou any thing?</p>
<p>Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,</p>
<p>That mak’st my blood cold, and my hair to stare 1016 ?</p>
<p>Speak to me what thou art.</p>
<p>GHOST Thy evil spirit, Brutus.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Why comest thou?</p>
<p>GHOST To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Well: then I shall see thee again?</p>
<p>GHOST Ay, at Philippi.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.</p>
<p>[Exit Ghost]</p>
<p>Now I have taken heart 1017 , thou vanishest.</p>
<p>Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.—</p>
<p>Boy, Lucius, Varrus, Claudio! Sirs, awake! Claudio!</p>
<p>LUCIUS The strings, my lord, are false 1018 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS He thinks he still is at his instrument.—</p>
<p>Lucius, awake!</p>
<p>LUCIUS My lord?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so cried’st out?</p>
<p>LUCIUS My lord, I do not know that I did cry.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see anything?</p>
<p>LUCIUS Nothing, my lord.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio,</p>
<p>Fellow thou 1019 , awake!</p>
<p>To Varrus</p>
<p>VARRUS My lord?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO My lord?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?</p>
<p>BOTH Did we, my lord?</p>
<p>They get up</p>
<p>BRUTUS Ay: saw you anything?</p>
<p>VARRUS No, my lord, I saw nothing.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Nor I, my lord.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Go and commend me 1020 to my brother Cassius:</p>
<p>Bid him set on his powers betimes before 1021</p>
<p>And we will follow.</p>
<p>BOTH It shall be done, my lord.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
