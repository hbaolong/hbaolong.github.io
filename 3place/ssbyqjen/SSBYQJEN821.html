<h4 id="scene-3-running-scene-22">Scene 3 / running scene 22</h4>
<p>Alarum. Retreat. Enter York, Richard, Warwick and Soldiers, with Drum
and Colours</p>
<p>YORK Of Salisbury, who can report of him,</p>
<p>That winter 1649 lion, who in rage forgets</p>
<p>Agèd contusions 1650 and all brush 1651 of time,</p>
<p>And, like a gallant 1652 in the brow 1653 of youth,</p>
<p>Repairs him with occasion 1654 ? This happy day</p>
<p>Is not itself, nor have we won one foot 1655 ,</p>
<p>If Salisbury be lost.</p>
<p>RICHARD My noble father:</p>
<p>Three times today I holp 1656 him to his horse,</p>
<p>Three times bestrid him 1657 : thrice I led him off,</p>
<p>Persuaded him from any further act:</p>
<p>But still 1658 where danger was, still there I met him,</p>
<p>And like rich hangings 1659 in a homely 1660 house,</p>
<p>So was his will in his old feeble body.</p>
<p>But noble as he is, look where he comes.</p>
<p>Enter Salisbury</p>
<p>SALISBURY Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought today:</p>
<p>By th’mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard.</p>
<p>God knows how long it is I have to live:</p>
<p>And it hath pleased him that three times today</p>
<p>You have defended me from imminent death.</p>
<p>Well, lords, we have not got that which we have 1661 :</p>
<p>’Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,</p>
<p>Being opposites of such repairing nature 1662 .</p>
<p>YORK I know our safety 1663 is to follow them,</p>
<p>For, as I hear, the king is fled to London,</p>
<p>To call a present 1664 court of parliament:</p>
<p>Let us pursue him ere the writs 1665 go forth.</p>
<p>What says Lord Warwick, shall we after them?</p>
<p>WARWICK After them? Nay, before them, if we can:</p>
<p>Now by my hand, lords, ’twas a glorious day.</p>
<p>St Albans battle won by famous York</p>
<p>Shall be eternized 1666 in all age to come.</p>
<p>Sound drum and trumpets, and to London all,</p>
<p>And more such days as these to us befall</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Textual Notes</p>
<p>Q = First Quarto text of 1594</p>
<p>Q2 = Second Quarto text of 1600</p>
<p>Q3 = Third Quarto text of 1619</p>
<p>F = First Folio text of 1623</p>
<p>F2 = a correction introduced in the Second Folio text of 1632</p>
<p>F4 = a correction introduced in the Fourth Folio text of 1685</p>
<p>Ed = a correction introduced by a later editor</p>
<p>SD = stage direction</p>
<p>SH = speech heading (i.e. speaker’s name)</p>
<p>List of parts = Ed</p>
<p>THE … HUMPHREY = F. Printed as The First Part of the Contention
betwixt the two famous Houses of York and Lancaster, with the death of
the good Duke Humphrey in Q, Q2 and Q3</p>
<p>1.1.24–31 Great … minister Q has the following alternative lines (all
alternative Q passages are here edited and modernized):</p>
<p>Th’excessive love I bear unto your grace</p>
<p>Forbids me to be lavish of my tongue,</p>
<p>Lest I should speak more than beseems a woman:</p>
<p>Let this suffice: my bliss is in your liking,</p>
<p>And nothing can make poor Margaret miserable,</p>
<p>Unless the frown of mighty England’s King.</p>
<p>49 SD Lets … fall derived from Q’s direction: Duke Humphrey lets it
fall 90 had = Ed. F = hath 98 Razing = Ed. F Racing 129 SH GLOUCESTER =
Ed. F = Hum ./Glo . (throughout) 166 hoist spelled hoyse in F 175
Protector = Q. F = Protectors 253 in my = Ed. F = in in my 254 grapple =
F, Q3. Q = graffle, although there is no record of it in the OED</p>
<p>1.2.19 thought = F. Ed = hour 22 dreams = F ( dreames) . Ed = dream
38 are = Q. F = wer 75 witch = F. Q = witch of Ely. Q3 = witch of Rye.
Ed = witch of Eye</p>
<p>1.3.4 SH FIRST PETITIONER = F4. F = Peter . In agreement with the
Textual Companion that the First Petitioner must have pushed forward to
warrant his apology, ‘Peter’ and ‘Petitioner’ being easily confused;
other editors defend F 22 master = Ed. F = Mistresse 23 usurper = F. Q =
usurer 58 haughty = F ( haughtie) . F2 = haught 80 the = F. Ed = their
90 At this point F has an exit direction for Suffolk, yet he contributes
to the following discussion; therefore his exit direction has been
removed 94 denied = Ed. F = denay’d 115 dauphin = Ed. F = Dolphin 132
I’d = Q. F = I could 140 fury = Ed. F = Fume. However, the emendation
better fits the metre and the mistake can be explained as a minim error
177 SH HORNER = Ed. F = Armorer 190 judge = F. Ed = judge by case 203–5
Away … away = F. The following alternative lines are spoken by
Gloucester in Q, where the action takes place before Queen Margaret
drops her glove (as opposed to F’s fan):</p>
<p>The law my lord is this by case, it rests suspicious</p>
<p>That a day of combat be appointed</p>
<p>And there to try each other’s right or wrong</p>
<p>Which shall be on the thirtieth of this month,</p>
<p>With Eben staves and standbags combatting</p>
<p>In Smithfield before your royal majesty.</p>
<p>The reference to ‘Eben staves’ and ‘standbags’ might refer to the
remembered performance of the scene</p>
<p>1.4.20 SH ASNATH = Ed. F = Spirit 21 SH MARGARET JORDAN = Ed. F =
Witch 36–7 Descend … avoid = F. Q has the following longer
alternative:</p>
<p>Then down, I say, unto the damnèd pool,</p>
<p>Where Pluto in his fiery wagon sits</p>
<p>Riding, amidst the singed and parchèd smokes,</p>
<p>The road of Ditis by the River Styx.</p>
<p>There howl and burn for ever in those flames.</p>
<p>Rise, Jordan, rise, and stay thy charming spells.</p>
<p>Zounds, we are betrayed!</p>
<p>56–7 The … death some editors move the reading aloud of the
prophecies to the next scene, following Q, which also assigns them to
King Henry</p>
<p>2.1.27 such = F. Ed = some 52 SH CARDINAL … you. = Ed. F = Cardinall,
I am with you. F presents the line as a continuation of Gloucester’s
speech rather than a response from the cardinal 65 SH TOWNSMAN = Ed. F =
One 136 his = Q. F = it,</p>
<p>2.2.35 Philippa = Ed. F = Phillip 46–7 who … son = Ed. F’s lines are
considered unmetrical and nonsensical:</p>
<p>Who was to Edmond Langley,</p>
<p>Edward the thirds fift Sonnes Sonne;</p>
<p>2.3.3 sins = Ed. F = sinne 65 After the First Prentice Q inserts a
third prentice who speaks the following line: Here, Peter, here’s a pint
of claret wine for thee. Q also adds the following extra line at the
beginning of F’s ‘Second’ Prentice’s line: And here’s a quart for
me.</p>
<p>3.1.0 SD Enter … parliament = F. Q has the following stage direction,
which may reflect contemporary performance:</p>
<p>Enter to the parliament. Enter two heralds before, then the Duke of
Buckingham, and the Duke of Suffolk, and then the Duke of York, and the
Cardinal of Winchester, and then the King and the Queen, and then the
Earl of Salisbury, and the Earl of Warwick.</p>
<p>78 wolves = F. Ed = wolf 117 disbursèd = Ed. F = dis-pursed which is
now archaic 264 deceit = F. Ed = conceit 329 For = F. Ed = From</p>
<p>3.2.0 SD Enter … Humphrey = F. Q = Then the curtains being drawn,
Duke Humphrey is discovered in his bed, and two men lying on his breast
and smothering him in his bed. And then enter the Duke of Suffolk to
them. 14 Away … gone = F. Q = Then draw the curtains again and get you
gone. Ed = Then draw the curtains close; away, be gone! SD Sound …
Attendants F’s original direction includes an entry for Suffolk, who is
already onstage, and is therefore omitted here 26 Meg = Ed. F = Nell 76
leper = Ed. F = Leaper 80 Dame = F. Ed = Queen Margaret = Ed. F =
Elianor 101 Margaret = Ed. F = Elianor 117 witch = Ed. F = watch 121
Margaret = Ed. F = Elinor 203 SD [ Exeunt … Somerset ] the direction
‘Exit Cardinal’ is found in Q; editors add an exit direction for
Somerset here because he has no further activity in the scene 232 SD
Exeunt … Warwick based on Q’s direction: Warwick pulls him out. Exit
Warwick and Suffolk. F = Exeunt</p>
<p>Q’s stage direction continues: and then all the Commons within,
cries, ‘Down with Suffolk, down with Suffolk’. This presumably
represents original performance, and it is on this basis that some
editors have decided to insert stage directions and/or spoken lines for
Commons</p>
<p>279 SH COMMONS = Ed. Not in F 309 enemies = Q. F = enemy. Privileging
Q over F results in agreement with ‘them’ in the following line 311
Could = Q. F = Would. Emendation directed by the editorial tradition in
response to the repeated use of ‘would’ in the following line 319 Mine =
F. Q = My on = Ed. F = an 333 turn = Ed. F = turnes 335 the = F. Q =
this 345 these = F. Ed = these lips 410 SD [ She kisses him ] = Q. Not
in F 415 SD severally = Q. Not in F</p>
<p>3.3.0 SD to … bed = F. Q = and then the curtains be drawn, and the
Cardinal is discovered in his bed, raving and staring as if he were
mad</p>
<p>4.1.0 SD a Master … prisoners based on Q’s stage direction: Alarms
within, and the chambers be discharged, like as it were a fight at sea.
And then enter the Captain of the ship and the Master, and the Master’s
Mate, and the Duke of Suffolk disguised, and others with him, and Walter
Whickmore 1 SH LIEUTENANT = F. Q = Captain 6 Clip = Ed. F = Cleape 20 SH
WHITMORE = Ed. In F these lines continue the Lieutenant’s speech 32
death = F. Ed = thee 48 Jove … I = Q. Not in F; justified by the
Lieutenant’s following line 50 Obscure … blood = F. Editors often
reassign this line to Suffolk, arguing that he is distinguishing between
himself and the Lieutenant. However, F’s reading can be supported as a
slight on Suffolk by the Lieutenant, and by Whitmore’s subsequent line
in response to Suffolk’s speech where he refers directly to Suffolk as
‘swain’ lousy = F ( lowsie) . Ed = lowly 72 SH SUFFOLK = Ed. F = Sir;
presumed compositor misreading of ‘Suf’ or ‘S’ or ‘Su’ 73 SH LIEUTENANT
= Ed. F = Lord; presumed compositor misreading of ‘Lieu’ or ‘L’ 79 shalt
= Q. F = shall 87 mother’s bleeding = Ed. F = Mother-bleeding 95 are =
Ed. F = and 114 Thy … me Q has an extra line at this point attributed to
the ‘Captain’, F’s Lieutenant : Ay, but my deeds shall stay thy fury
soon. Some editions print the following: But my deeds, Suffolk, soon
shall stay thy rage. 134 SH SUFFOLK = Ed. In F this line is spoken by
the Lieutenant, but Suffolk’s ‘That’ appears to refer to it as his
own</p>
<p>4.2.0, 22 SD with long staves = Q. Not in F 24 SH DICK = Ed. F = But.
25 fail = F. Ed = fall, on the grounds that Cade is punning on his name,
Latin ‘cadere’ meaning ‘to fall’ 34 SH SMITH = Ed. F = Weaver 62 SD
Chartham = Ed. Q = Chattam . Both are places in the south-east of
England 76 an = F2. F = a 79 SD Michael = F. Q = Tom . Ed = a messenger
88 Mortimer at this point in Q Cade also knights Dick the butcher</p>
<p>4.4.21 mourning for = F, Q. Ed = mourning 42 traitors = F. Ed =
trait’rous rabble 48 hath = F. Q = hath almost 57 be betrayed = F2. F =
betraid</p>
<p>4.6.7 SH SMITH = Ed. F = But .</p>
<p>4.7.6 SH HOLLAND = Ed. F = Iohn. In this edition the character
labelled ‘John’ is identified as ‘John Holland’ and therefore assigned
the speech heading ‘Holland’, rather than identifying him as a new
character, as in other editions 32 on = Q. F = in 40 Away … Latin = F.
In place of this Q has the following lines:</p>
<p>CADE ‘Bonum terrum’. Zounds, what is that?</p>
<p>DICK He speaks French.</p>
<p>WILL No, ’tis Dutch.</p>
<p>NICK No, ’tis Outalian: I know it well enough.</p>
<p>52 Kent = F. Ed = But 69 caudle = F4. F = Candle help of = F. Ed =
health o’th’ 84 At this point Q adds the following detail taken from the
Chronicles: to the Standard in Cheapside 85 Q again adds the following
detail, again present in the Chronicles: go to Mile End Green 95 men =
F. Q = Married men 96 At this point Q has the following additional
lines, thought to be an authorial addition to the promptbook by some
editors :</p>
<p>Enter Robin</p>
<p>ROBIN O captain, London Bridge is afire!</p>
<p>CADE Run to Billingsgate and fetch pitch and flax and squench it.</p>
<p>Enter Dick and a Sergeant</p>
<p>SERGEANT Justice, justice, I pray you, sir, let me have justice of
this fellow here.</p>
<p>CADE Why, what has he done?</p>
<p>SERGEANT Alas, sir, he has ravished my wife.</p>
<p>BUTCHER Why, my lord, he would have ’rested me and I went and entered
my action in his wife’s paper house.</p>
<p>CADE Dick, follow thy suit in her common place. You whoreson villain,
you are a sergeant — you’ll take any man by the throat for twelvepence,
and ’rest a man when he’s at dinner, and have him to prison ere the meat
be out of his mouth. Go, Dick, take him hence: cut out his tongue for
cogging, hough him for running, and, to conclude, brave him with his own
mace.</p>
<p>Exit [Butcher ] with the Sergeant</p>
<p>99 Additional lines at this point in Q for Cade: He that will lustily
stand to it shall go with me and take up these commodities following:
item, a gown, a kirtle, a petticoat, and a smock.</p>
<p>[Act 4 Scene 8] there is no scene break at this point in Q. Some
editors explain the apparent scene break in F as necessary in order to
waste space at the end of the page due to incorrectly cast-off copy.</p>
<p>4.8.12 rabble = F. Ed = rebel 28 SD They … again = Q. Not in F</p>
<p>4.9.33 calmed = F4. F = calme 34 dispersed = Ed. F = dispierc’d</p>
<p>4.10.4 o’er = Ed. F = on 15 waning = Ed. F = warning 48 Jove = F. Q =
God</p>
<p>5.1.10 soul = F. Ed = sword 30–1 But … strong = F. In place of these
lines Q has the following:</p>
<p>ut York dissemble, till thou meet thy sons,</p>
<p>Who now in arms expect their father’s sight,</p>
<p>And not far hence I know they cannot be.</p>
<p>70 trouble Q adds the following lines:</p>
<p>A visage stern, coal-black his curlèd locks,</p>
<p>Deep trenchèd furrows in his frowning brow,</p>
<p>Presageth warlike humours in his life.</p>
<p>83 wi’th’queen = Ed. F = with th’Queen 109 these = Ed. F = thee 111
sons = Q. F = sonne 113 for = F2. F = of 149 bearherd = Ed. F = Berard
194 or = Ed. F = and 201 household = Q. F = housed. F2 = house’s 210
bearherd = Ed. F = Bearard</p>
<p>5.2.0 SD [ Alarums … battle ] = Q. Not in F 62 As … mine = F. Q
includes a confrontation between Young Clifford and Richard in place of
F’s lines:</p>
<p>[YOUNG CLIFFORD] = And thus as old Anchises’ son did bear</p>
<p>His agèd father on his manly back,</p>
<p>And fought with him against the bloody Greeks,</p>
<p>Even so will I. But stay, here’s one of them,</p>
<p>To whom my soul hath sworn immortal hate.</p>
<p>Enter RICHARD, and then [YOUNG ] CLIFFORD lays down his father,
fights with him, and Richard flies away again.</p>
<p>Out, crookback villain, get thee from my sight,</p>
<p>But I will after thee, and once again</p>
<p>When I have borne my father to his tent,</p>
<p>I’ll try my fortune better with thee yet.</p>
<p>Exit Young Clifford with his father</p>
<p>5.3.1 SH YORK = York has four lines in Q which precede his speech in
F:</p>
<p>How now, boys: fortunate this fight hath been,</p>
<p>I hope to us and ours, for England’s good,</p>
<p>And our great honour, that so long we lost</p>
<p>Whilst faint-heart Henry did usurp our rights:</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster , and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading ‘bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
<p>“This new Complete Works from the RSC is a glorious edition of one of
the world’s most important books. It’s the essential reference book for
anyone who’s ever been in love, felt jealousy, fear, hatred, or desire.
All human life is here - and every home should have one.“</p>
