<h4 id="scene-4-running-scene-10">Scene 4 / running scene 10</h4>
<p>Enter Queen and Polonius</p>
<p>POLONIUS He will come straight 1215 . Look you lay home 1216 to
him:</p>
<p>Tell him his pranks have been too broad 1217 to bear with,</p>
<p>And that your grace hath screened and stood between</p>
<p>Much heat 1218 and him. I’ll silence me e’en here.</p>
<p>Pray you, be round 1219 with him.</p>
<p>HAMLET Mother, mother, mother!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>GERTRUDE I’ll warrant you,</p>
<p>Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.</p>
<p>Enter Hamlet</p>
<p>Polonius hides behind the arras</p>
<p>HAMLET Now, mother, what’s the matter?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.</p>
<p>HAMLET Mother, you have my father much offended.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.</p>
<p>HAMLET Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Why, how now, Hamlet?</p>
<p>HAMLET What’s the matter now?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Have you forgot me?</p>
<p>HAMLET No, by the rood 1220 , not so:</p>
<p>You are the queen 1221 , your husband’s brother’s wife,</p>
<p>But — would you were not so — you are my mother.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Nay, then, I’ll set those to you that can speak.</p>
<p>HAMLET Come, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge:</p>
<p>You go not till I set you up a glass 1222</p>
<p>Where you may see the inmost part of you.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?</p>
<p>Help, help, ho!</p>
<p>POLONIUS What, ho? Help, help, help!</p>
<p>Behind the arras</p>
<p>HAMLET How now? A rat? Dead, for a ducat 1223 , dead!</p>
<p>Draws</p>
<p>POLONIUS O, I am slain!</p>
<p>[Hamlet] kills Polonius</p>
<p>GERTRUDE O me, what hast thou done?</p>
<p>HAMLET Nay, I know not: is it the king?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!</p>
<p>HAMLET A bloody deed: almost as bad, good mother,</p>
<p>As kill a king and marry with his brother.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE As kill a king?</p>
<p>HAMLET Ay, lady, ’twas my word.—</p>
<p>Discovers Polonius</p>
<p>Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell.</p>
<p>I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;</p>
<p>Thou find’st to be too busy 1224 is some danger.—</p>
<p>Leave wringing of your hands. Peace. Sit you down,</p>
<p>And let me wring your heart, for so I shall,</p>
<p>If it be made of penetrable stuff,</p>
<p>If damnèd custom have not brazed 1225 it so</p>
<p>That it is proof 1226 and bulwark against sense 1227 .</p>
<p>GERTRUDE What have I done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongue</p>
<p>In noise so rude 1228 against me?</p>
<p>HAMLET Such an act</p>
<p>That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,</p>
<p>Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose</p>
<p>From the fair forehead of an innocent love</p>
<p>And sets a blister there, makes marriage vows</p>
<p>As false as dicers’ oaths: O, such a deed</p>
<p>As from the body of contraction 1229 plucks</p>
<p>The very soul, and sweet religion makes</p>
<p>A rhapsody 1230 of words. Heaven’s face doth glow 1231 :</p>
<p>Yea, this solidity and compound mass 1232</p>
<p>With tristful 1233 visage, as against the doom 1234 ,</p>
<p>Is thought-sick at the act.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Ay me, what act,</p>
<p>That roars so loud and thunders in the index 1235 ?</p>
<p>HAMLET Look here, upon this picture, and on this,</p>
<p>Shows her two pictures</p>
<p>The counterfeit presentment 1236 of two brothers.</p>
<p>See what a grace was seated on his brow:</p>
<p>Hyperion 1237 ’s curls, the front 1238 of Jove himself,</p>
<p>An eye like Mars 1239 to threaten or command,</p>
<p>A station 1240 like the herald Mercury 1241</p>
<p>New-lighted 1242 on a heaven-kissing hill,</p>
<p>A combination and a form indeed</p>
<p>Where every god did seem to set his seal 1243</p>
<p>To give the world assurance of a man:</p>
<p>This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:</p>
<p>Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear 1244 ,</p>
<p>Blasting 1245 his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</p>
<p>Could you on this fair mountain leave 1246 to feed</p>
<p>And batten 1247 on this moor 1248 ? Ha! Have you eyes?</p>
<p>You cannot call it love, for at your age</p>
<p>The heyday in the blood 1249 is tame, it’s humble,</p>
<p>And waits upon the judgement: and what judgement</p>
<p>Would step from this to this? What devil was’t</p>
<p>That thus hath cozened 1250 you at hoodman-blind 1251 ?</p>
<p>O, shame, where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,</p>
<p>If thou canst mutine 1252 in a matron 1253 ’s bones,</p>
<p>To flaming youth let virtue be as wax</p>
<p>And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame</p>
<p>When the compulsive ardour gives the charge 1254 ,</p>
<p>Since frost 1255 itself as actively doth burn</p>
<p>And reason panders 1256 will 1257 .</p>
<p>GERTRUDE O Hamlet, speak no more:</p>
<p>Thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul,</p>
<p>And there I see such black and grainèd 1258 spots</p>
<p>As will not leave their tinct 1259 .</p>
<p>HAMLET Nay, but to live</p>
<p>In the rank sweat of an enseamèd 1260 bed,</p>
<p>Stewed 1261 in corruption, honeying 1262 and making love 1263</p>
<p>Over the nasty 1264 sty 1265 —</p>
<p>GERTRUDE O, speak to me no more:</p>
<p>These words like daggers enter in mine ears.</p>
<p>No more, sweet Hamlet!</p>
<p>HAMLET A murderer and a villain,</p>
<p>A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe 1266</p>
<p>Of your precedent lord 1267 , a vice 1268 of kings,</p>
<p>A cutpurse 1269 of the empire and the rule,</p>
<p>That from a shelf the precious diadem 1270 stole,</p>
<p>And put it in his pocket!</p>
<p>GERTRUDE No more!</p>
<p>Enter Ghost</p>
<p>HAMLET A king of shreds and patches 1271 —</p>
<p>Save me, and hover o’er me with your wings,</p>
<p>Sees the Ghost</p>
<p>You heavenly guards!— What would you, gracious figure?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Alas, he’s mad!</p>
<p>HAMLET Do you not come your tardy son to chide,</p>
<p>That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by</p>
<p>Th’important 1272 acting of your dread command? O, say!</p>
<p>GHOST Do not forget: this visitation</p>
<p>Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.</p>
<p>But look, amazement on thy mother sits.</p>
<p>O, step between her and her fighting soul:</p>
<p>Conceit 1273 in weakest bodies strongest works:</p>
<p>Speak to her, Hamlet.</p>
<p>HAMLET How is it with you, lady?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Alas, how is’t with you,</p>
<p>That you do bend your eye on vacancy</p>
<p>And with th’incorporal 1274 air do hold discourse?</p>
<p>Forth at your eyes your spirits 1275 wildly peep,</p>
<p>And, as the sleeping soldiers in th’alarm 1276 ,</p>
<p>Your bedded hair, like life in excrements 1277 ,</p>
<p>Start up and stand on end. O gentle son,</p>
<p>Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper</p>
<p>Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?</p>
<p>HAMLET On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!</p>
<p>His form and cause conjoined 1278 , preaching to stones,</p>
<p>Would make them capable 1279 .— Do not look upon me,</p>
<p>To the Ghost</p>
<p>Lest with this piteous 1280 action you convert</p>
<p>My stern effects 1281 : then what I have to do</p>
<p>Will want 1282 true colour 1283 ; tears perchance for blood.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE To who do you speak this?</p>
<p>HAMLET Do you see nothing there?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Nothing at all, yet all that is I see.</p>
<p>HAMLET Nor did you nothing hear?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE No, nothing but ourselves.</p>
<p>HAMLET Why, look you there: look, how it steals away.</p>
<p>My father, in his habit 1284 as 1285 he lived!</p>
<p>Look where he goes even now out at the portal.</p>
<p>Exit [Ghost]</p>
<p>GERTRUDE This is the very coinage 1286 of your brain:</p>
<p>This bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning 1287 in.</p>
<p>HAMLET Ecstasy?</p>
<p>My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time,</p>
<p>And makes as healthful music: it is not madness</p>
<p>That I have uttered. Bring me to the test,</p>
<p>And I the matter will reword 1288 , which madness</p>
<p>Would gambol 1289 from. Mother, for love of grace,</p>
<p>Lay not a flattering unction 1290 to your soul</p>
<p>That not your trespass 1291 , but my madness speaks:</p>
<p>It will but skin and film 1292 the ulcerous place,</p>
<p>Whilst rank corruption, mining 1293 all within,</p>
<p>Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,</p>
<p>Repent what’s past, avoid what is to come,</p>
<p>And do not spread the compost o’er the weeds</p>
<p>To make them ranker 1294 . Forgive me this my virtue 1295 ,</p>
<p>For in the fatness of these pursy 1296 times</p>
<p>Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,</p>
<p>Yea, curb and woo 1297 for leave to do him good.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.</p>
<p>HAMLET O, throw away the worser part of it,</p>
<p>And live the purer with the other half.</p>
<p>Goodnight. But go not to mine uncle’s bed:</p>
<p>Assume a virtue, if you have it not.</p>
<p>Refrain tonight,</p>
<p>And that shall lend a kind of easiness</p>
<p>To the next abstinence. Once more, goodnight:</p>
<p>And when you are desirous to be blessed,</p>
<p>I’ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,</p>
<p>Points to the body</p>
<p>I do repent, but heaven hath pleased it so</p>
<p>To punish me with this, and this with me,</p>
<p>That 1298 I must be their scourge and minister 1299 .</p>
<p>I will bestow 1300 him, and will answer well 1301</p>
<p>The death I gave him. So, again, goodnight.</p>
<p>I must be cruel, only to be kind:</p>
<p>Thus bad begins and worse remains behind 1302 .</p>
<p>GERTRUDE What shall I do?</p>
<p>HAMLET Not this by no means that I bid you do:</p>
<p>Let the bloat 1303 king tempt you again to bed,</p>
<p>Pinch wanton 1304 on your cheek, call you his mouse 1305 ,</p>
<p>And let him, for a pair of reechy 1306 kisses,</p>
<p>Or paddling in your neck with his damned fingers,</p>
<p>Make you to ravel all this matter out 1307 ,</p>
<p>That I essentially am not in madness,</p>
<p>But mad in craft 1308 . ’Twere good you let him know,</p>
<p>For who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,</p>
<p>Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib 1309 ,</p>
<p>Such dear concernings 1310 hide? Who would do so?</p>
<p>No, in despite of sense and secrecy,</p>
<p>Unpeg 1311 the basket on the house’s top,</p>
<p>Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,</p>
<p>To try conclusions 1312 , in the basket creep,</p>
<p>And break your own neck down 1313 .</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Be thou assured, if words be made of breath</p>
<p>And breath of life, I have no life to breathe</p>
<p>What thou hast said to me.</p>
<p>HAMLET I must to England: you know that?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Alack,</p>
<p>I had forgot: ’tis so concluded on.</p>
<p>HAMLET This man shall set me packing 1314 :</p>
<p>I’ll lug the guts into the neighbour room.</p>
<p>Mother, goodnight. Indeed this counsellor</p>
<p>Is now most still, most secret and most grave 1315 ,</p>
<p>Who was in life a foolish prating 1316 knave.—</p>
<p>Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you 1317 .—</p>
<p>Goodnight, mother.</p>
<p>Exit Hamlet tugging in Polonius</p>
<p>Enter King</p>
<p>KING There’s matter 1318 in these sighs, these profound heaves,</p>
<p>You must translate: ’tis fit we understand them.</p>
<p>Where is your son?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!</p>
<p>KING What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Mad as the seas and wind when both contend</p>
<p>Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,</p>
<p>Behind the arras hearing something stir,</p>
<p>He whips his rapier out and cries, ‘A rat, a rat!’</p>
<p>And in his brainish apprehension 1319 kills</p>
<p>The unseen good old man.</p>
<p>KING O, heavy 1320 deed!</p>
<p>It had been so with us, had we been there.</p>
<p>His liberty is full of threats to all:</p>
<p>To you yourself, to us, to everyone.</p>
<p>Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered 1321 ?</p>
<p>It will be laid to us, whose providence 1322</p>
<p>Should have kept short 1323 , restrained and out of haunt 1324</p>
<p>This mad young man: but so much was our love,</p>
<p>We would not understand what was most fit,</p>
<p>But, like the owner of a foul disease,</p>
<p>To keep it from divulging 1325 , lets it feed</p>
<p>Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE To draw apart 1326 the body he hath killed,</p>
<p>O’er whom his very madness, like some ore 1327</p>
<p>Among a mineral 1328 of metals base,</p>
<p>Shows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.</p>
<p>KING O Gertrude, come away!</p>
<p>The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,</p>
<p>But we will ship him hence, and this vile deed</p>
<p>We must with all our majesty and skill,</p>
<p>Both countenance 1329 and excuse.—</p>
<p>Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</p>
<p>Ho, Guildenstern!</p>
<p>Friends both, go join you with some further aid.</p>
<p>Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,</p>
<p>And from his mother’s closet hath he dragged him:</p>
<p>Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body</p>
<p>Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.</p>
<p>Exeunt Gentlemen [Ros. and Guild.]</p>
<p>Come, Gertrude, we’ll call up our wisest friends</p>
<p>To let them know, both what we mean to do</p>
<p>And what’s untimely done 1330 . O, come away!</p>
<p>My soul is full of discord and dismay.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
