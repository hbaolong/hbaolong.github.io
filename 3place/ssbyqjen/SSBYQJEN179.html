13</h4>
<p>Enter Solanio and Salerio</p>
<p>SOLANIO Now, what news on the Rialto?</p>
<p>SALERIO Why, yet it lives there unchecked 753 that Antonio hath a
ship of rich lading 754 wrecked on the narrow seas 755 ; the Goodwins
756 , I think they call the place, a very dangerous flat 757 and fatal,
where the carcasses of many a tall 758 ship lie buried, as they say, if
my gossip 759 ’s report be an honest woman of her word.</p>
<p>SOLANIO I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped
760 ginger 761 or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of
a third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity 762 or
crossing 763 the plain highway of talk 764 , that the good Antonio, the
honest Antonio — O that I had a title good enough to keep his name
company!—</p>
<p>SALERIO Come, the full stop 765 .</p>
<p>SOLANIO Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a
ship.</p>
<p>SALERIO I would it might prove 766 the end of his losses.</p>
<p>SOLANIO Let me say ‘amen’ betimes 767 , lest the devil cross 768 my
prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew. How now, Shylock!
What news among the merchants?</p>
<p>Enter Shylock</p>
<p>SHYLOCK You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter’s
flight.</p>
<p>SALERIO That’s certain. I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the
wings 769 she flew withal.</p>
<p>SOLANIO And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged 770
. and then it is the complexion 771 of them all to leave the dam 772
.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK She is damned for it.</p>
<p>SOLANIO That’s certain, if the devil 773 may be her judge.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK My own flesh and blood 774 to rebel!</p>
<p>SOLANIO Out upon it 775 , old carrion 776 ! Rebels it at these years
777 ?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.</p>
<p>SALERIO There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than
between jet and ivory 778 , more between your bloods than there is
between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio
have had any loss at sea or no?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK There I have another bad match 779 : a bankrupt, a prodigal,
who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that was used to
come so smug upon the mart 780 . Let him look to 781 his bond. He was
wont to call me usurer. Let him look to his bond. He was wont to lend
money for a Christian courtesy 782 . Let him look to his bond.</p>
<p>SALERIO Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh.
What’s that good for?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK To bait fish withal. If it will feed nothing else, it will
feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and hindered me 783 half a
million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation,
thwarted my bargains, cooled 784 my friends, heated 785 mine enemies,
and what’s the reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew
hands, organs, dimensions 786 , senses, affections 787 , passions 788 ?
Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same
diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter
and summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you
tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you
wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will
resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility
789 ? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance
790 be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me I
will execute, and it shall go hard but 791 I will better the instruction
792 .</p>
<p>Enter a man from Antonio</p>
<p>SERVANT Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and desires to
speak with you both.</p>
<p>SALERIO We have been up and down 793 to seek him.</p>
<p>Enter Tubal</p>
<p>SOLANIO Here comes another of the tribe 794 . A third cannot be
matched 795 , unless the devil himself turn Jew.</p>
<p>Exeunt Gentlemen [Solanio, Salerio and Servant ]</p>
<p>SHYLOCK How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa 796 ? Hast thou found my
daughter?</p>
<p>TUBAL I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Why, there, there, there, there! A diamond gone, cost me two
thousand ducats in Frankfurt 797 ! The curse 798 never fell upon our
nation till now, I never felt it till now. Two thousand ducats in that,
and other precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter were dead at my
foot, and the jewels in her ear! Would she were hearsed 799 at my foot,
and the ducats in her coffin! No news of them? Why, so — and I know not
how much is spent in the search. Why, thou loss upon loss! The thief
gone with so much, and so much to find the thief, and no satisfaction
800 , no revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights 801 o’my
shoulders, no sighs but o’my breathing, no tears but o’my shedding.</p>
<p>TUBAL Yes, other men have ill luck too. Antonio, as I heard in
Genoa—</p>
<p>SHYLOCK What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?</p>
<p>TUBAL —hath an argosy cast away 802 , coming from Tripolis.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I thank God, I thank God. Is it true, is it true?</p>
<p>TUBAL I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I thank thee, good Tubal, good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard
in Genoa?</p>
<p>TUBAL Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night fourscore
803 ducats.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Thou stick’st a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold
again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting 804 , fourscore ducats!</p>
<p>TUBAL There came divers 805 of Antonio’s creditors in my company to
Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break 806 .</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I am very glad of it. I’ll plague him, I’ll torture him. I am
glad of it.</p>
<p>TUBAL One of 807 them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter
for a monkey.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Out upon her! 808 Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my
turquoise, I had it of Leah 809 when I was a bachelor. I would not have
given it for a wilderness 810 of monkeys.</p>
<p>TUBAL But Antonio is certainly undone 811 .</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Nay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal, fee 812 me an
officer 813 , bespeak 814 him a fortnight before 815 . I will have the
heart of him, if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice I can make what
816 merchandise 817 I will 818 . Go, Tubal, and meet me at our
synagogue. Go, good Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal.</p>
<p>Exeunt [separately ]</p>
