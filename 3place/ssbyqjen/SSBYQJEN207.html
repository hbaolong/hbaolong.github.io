<h4 id="scene-5-running-scene-9-continues">Scene 5 ／ running scene 9
continues</h4>
<p>Enter Silvius and Phoebe</p>
<p>SILVIUS Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me, do not, Phoebe.</p>
<p>Say that you love me not, but say not so</p>
<p>In bitterness. The common executioner,</p>
<p>Whose heart th’accustomed sight of death makes hard,</p>
<p>Falls 867 not the axe upon the humbled neck</p>
<p>But first begs pardon 868 : will you sterner be</p>
<p>Than he that dies and lives 869 by bloody drops?</p>
<p>Enter Rosalind, Celia and Corin</p>
<p>They stand aside</p>
<p>PHOEBE I would not be thy executioner.</p>
<p>I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.</p>
<p>Thou tell’st me there is murder in mine eye:</p>
<p>’Tis pretty 870 , sure, and very probable,</p>
<p>That eyes, that are the frail’st and softest things,</p>
<p>Who shut their coward gates 871 on atomies 872 ,</p>
<p>Should be called tyrants, butchers, murderers.</p>
<p>Now I do frown on thee with all my heart,</p>
<p>And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.</p>
<p>Now counterfeit 873 to swoon, why now fall down,</p>
<p>Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,</p>
<p>Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.</p>
<p>Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:</p>
<p>Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains</p>
<p>Some scar of it. Lean but upon a rush 874 ,</p>
<p>The cicatrice 875 and capable impressure 876</p>
<p>Thy palm some moment keeps. But now mine eyes,</p>
<p>Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,</p>
<p>Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes</p>
<p>That can do hurt.</p>
<p>SILVIUS O dear Phoebe, If ever — as that ever may be near —</p>
<p>You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy 877 ,</p>
<p>Then shall you know the wounds invisible</p>
<p>That love’s keen 878 arrows make.</p>
<p>PHOEBE But till that time</p>
<p>Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,</p>
<p>Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not,</p>
<p>As till that time I shall not pity thee.</p>
<p>ROSALIND And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,</p>
<p>Steps forward</p>
<p>That you insult, exult, and all at once,</p>
<p>Over the wretched? What though 879 you have no beauty —</p>
<p>As, by my faith, I see no more in you</p>
<p>Than without candle may go dark to bed 880 —</p>
<p>Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?</p>
<p>Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?</p>
<p>I see no more in you than in the ordinary 881</p>
<p>Of nature’s sale-work 882 . ’Od’s 883 my little life,</p>
<p>I think she means to tangle 884 my eyes too!</p>
<p>No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:</p>
<p>’Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,</p>
<p>Your bugle 885 eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream</p>
<p>That can entame my spirits to your worship.</p>
<p>You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,</p>
<p>To Silvius</p>
<p>Like foggy south 886 , puffing with wind and rain 887 ?</p>
<p>You are a thousand times a properer 888 man</p>
<p>Than she a woman. ’Tis such fools as you</p>
<p>That makes the world full of ill-favoured children.</p>
<p>’Tis not her glass 889 but you that flatters her,</p>
<p>And out of you she sees herself more proper</p>
<p>Than any of her lineaments 890 can show her.</p>
<p>But mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,</p>
<p>And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love;</p>
<p>For I must tell you friendly in your ear,</p>
<p>Sell when you can, you are not for all markets.</p>
<p>Cry 891 the man mercy, love him, take his offer:</p>
<p>Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer 892 .</p>
<p>So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.</p>
<p>PHOEBE Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together 893 :</p>
<p>I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.</p>
<p>ROSALIND He’s fallen in love with your foulness— and she’ll fall in
love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with
frowning looks, I’ll sauce 894 her with bitter words.— Why look you so
upon me?</p>
<p>Aside or to</p>
<p>Phoebe/To Silvius</p>
<p>To Phoebe</p>
<p>PHOEBE For no ill will I bear you.</p>
<p>ROSALIND I pray you do not fall in love with me,</p>
<p>For I am falser than vows made in wine 895 .</p>
<p>Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,</p>
<p>’Tis at the tuft of olives 896 , here hard 897 by.</p>
<p>Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply 898 her hard.</p>
<p>Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,</p>
<p>And be not proud: though all the world could see,</p>
<p>None could be so abused in sight 899 as he.</p>
<p>Come, to our flock.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Rosalind, Celia and Corin ]</p>
<p>PHOEBE Dead Shepherd 900 , now I find thy saw 901 of might 902 ,</p>
<p>‘Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?’</p>
<p>SILVIUS Sweet Phoebe—</p>
<p>PHOEBE Ha, what say’st thou, Silvius?</p>
<p>SILVIUS Sweet Phoebe, pity me.</p>
<p>PHOEBE Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.</p>
<p>SILVIUS Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.</p>
<p>If you do sorrow at my grief in love,</p>
<p>By giving love your sorrow and my grief</p>
<p>Were both extermined 903 .</p>
<p>PHOEBE Thou hast my love. Is not that neighbourly 904 ?</p>
<p>SILVIUS I would have you.</p>
<p>PHOEBE Why, that were covetousness 905 .</p>
<p>Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;</p>
<p>And yet it is not that I bear thee love,</p>
<p>But since that thou canst talk of love so well,</p>
<p>Thy company, which erst 906 was irksome to me,</p>
<p>I will endure; and I’ll employ thee too.</p>
<p>But do not look for further recompense</p>
<p>Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.</p>
<p>SILVIUS So holy and so perfect is my love,</p>
<p>And I in such a poverty 907 of grace,</p>
<p>That I shall think it a most plenteous crop</p>
<p>To glean the broken ears 908 after the man</p>
<p>That the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then</p>
<p>A scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon.</p>
<p>PHOEBE Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile 909 ?</p>
<p>SILVIUS Not very well, but I have met him oft,</p>
<p>And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds 910</p>
<p>That the old carlot 911 once was master of.</p>
<p>PHOEBE Think not I love him, though I ask for him:</p>
<p>’Tis but a peevish 912 boy, yet he talks well.</p>
<p>But what care I for words? Yet words do well</p>
<p>When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.</p>
<p>It is a pretty youth, not very pretty.</p>
<p>But sure he’s proud, and yet his pride becomes him;</p>
<p>He’ll make a proper man. The best thing in him</p>
<p>Is his complexion 913 . And faster than his tongue</p>
<p>Did make offence his eye did heal it up.</p>
<p>He is not very tall, yet for his years he’s tall.</p>
<p>His leg is but so-so, and yet ’tis well.</p>
<p>There was a pretty redness in his lip,</p>
<p>A little riper and more lusty 914 red</p>
<p>Than that mixed in his cheek. ’Twas just the difference</p>
<p>Betwixt the constant 915 red and mingled damask 916 .</p>
<p>There be some women, Silvius, had they marked him</p>
<p>In parcels 917 as I did, would have gone near</p>
<p>To fall in love with him. But, for my part,</p>
<p>I love him not nor hate him not. And yet</p>
<p>Have more cause to hate him than to love him:</p>
<p>For what had he to do to chide at me?</p>
<p>He said mine eyes were black and my hair black,</p>
<p>And, now I am remembered 918 , scorned at me.</p>
<p>I marvel why I answered not again 919 .</p>
<p>But that’s all one: omittance is no quittance 920 .</p>
<p>I’ll write to him a very taunting letter,</p>
<p>And thou shalt bear it. Wilt thou, Silvius?</p>
<p>SILVIUS Phoebe, with all my heart.</p>
<p>PHOEBE I’ll write it straight 921 :</p>
<p>The matter’s in my head and in my heart.</p>
<p>I will be bitter with him and passing 922 short.</p>
<p>Go with me, Silvius.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
