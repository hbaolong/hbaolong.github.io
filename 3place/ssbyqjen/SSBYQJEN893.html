<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-5-602">Scene 2 ／ running scene 5 602</h4>
<p>Enter Lord Chamberlain, reading this letter</p>
<p>CHAMBERLAIN ’My lord, the horses your lordship sent for, with all the
care I had, I</p>
<p>saw well chosen, ridden 603 and furnished 604 . They were young and
handsome, and of</p>
<p>the best breed in the north. When they were ready to set out for
London, a man of</p>
<p>my lord cardinal’s, by commission 605 and main 606 power, took ’em
from me, with this</p>
<p>reason: his master would be served before a subject, if not before
the king, which</p>
<p>stopped our mouths, sir.’ I fear he will indeed: well, let him have
them: he will</p>
<p>have all, I think.</p>
<p>Enter to the Lord Chamberlain the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk</p>
<p>NORFOLK Well met, my Lord Chamberlain.</p>
<p>CHAMBERLAIN Good day to both your graces.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK How is the king employed?</p>
<p>CHAMBERLAIN I left him private 607 ,</p>
<p>Full of sad 608 thoughts and troubles.</p>
<p>NORFOLK What’s the cause?</p>
<p>CHAMBERLAIN It seems the marriage with his brother’s wife</p>
<p>Has crept too near his conscience 609 .</p>
<p>SUFFOLK No, his conscience</p>
<p>Has crept too near another lady.</p>
<p>NORFOLK ’Tis so:</p>
<p>This is the cardinal’s doing: the king-cardinal,</p>
<p>That blind 610 priest, like the eldest son of fortune,</p>
<p>Turns what he list 611 . The king will know 612 him one day.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Pray God he 613 do: he’ll never know himself else.</p>
<p>NORFOLK How holily he works in all his business,</p>
<p>And with what zeal! For now he has cracked the league</p>
<p>Between us and the emperor, the queen’s great-nephew,</p>
<p>He dives into the king’s soul, and there scatters</p>
<p>Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,</p>
<p>Fears, and despairs, and all these for his marriage.</p>
<p>And out of all these, to restore the king,</p>
<p>He counsels a divorce, a loss of her</p>
<p>That like a jewel has hung twenty years</p>
<p>About his neck, yet never lost her lustre:</p>
<p>Of her that loves him with that excellence</p>
<p>That angels love good men with: even of her</p>
<p>That when the greatest stroke of fortune falls</p>
<p>Will bless the king: and is not this course pious?</p>
<p>CHAMBERLAIN Heaven keep me from such counsel: ’tis most true</p>
<p>These news are everywhere, every tongue speaks ’em,</p>
<p>And every true heart weeps for’t. All that dare</p>
<p>Look into these affairs see this main end 614 :</p>
<p>The French king’s sister 615 . Heaven will one day open</p>
<p>The king’s eyes, that so long have slept upon 616</p>
<p>This bold 617 bad man.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK And free us from his slavery.</p>
<p>NORFOLK We had need pray,</p>
<p>And heartily, for our deliverance,</p>
<p>Or this imperious man will work us all</p>
<p>From princes into pages: all men’s honours</p>
<p>Lie like one lump 618 before him, to be fashioned</p>
<p>Into what pitch 619 he please.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK For 620 me, my lords,</p>
<p>I love him not, nor fear him: there’s my creed:</p>
<p>As I am made 621 without him, so I’ll stand 622 ,</p>
<p>If the king please: his curses and his blessings</p>
<p>Touch me alike: they’re breath 623 I not believe in.</p>
<p>I knew him, and I know him: so I leave him</p>
<p>To him that made him proud: the Pope.</p>
<p>NORFOLK Let’s in,</p>
<p>And with some other business put the king</p>
<p>From these sad thoughts, that work too much upon him:</p>
<p>My lord, you’ll bear us company?</p>
<p>CHAMBERLAIN Excuse me,</p>
<p>The king has sent me otherwhere 624 : besides,</p>
<p>You’ll find a most unfit time to disturb him:</p>
<p>Health to your lordships.</p>
<p>NORFOLK Thanks, my good Lord Chamberlain.</p>
<p>Exit Lord Chamberlain, and the King [Henry ] draws the curtain 625
and sits reading pensively</p>
<p>SUFFOLK How sad he looks: sure, he is much afflicted.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Who’s there? Ha?</p>
<p>NORFOLK Pray God he be not angry.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Who’s there, I say? How dare you thrust
yourselves</p>
<p>Into my private meditations?</p>
<p>Who am I? Ha?</p>
<p>NORFOLK A gracious king that pardons all offences</p>
<p>Malice ne’er meant: our breach of duty this way 626</p>
<p>Is business of estate 627 , in which we come</p>
<p>To know your royal pleasure.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Ye are too bold:</p>
<p>Go to 628 : I’ll make ye know your times of business:</p>
<p>Is this an hour for temporal 629 affairs? Ha?</p>
<p>Enter [Cardinal ] Wolsey and [Cardinal ] Campeius with a commission
630</p>
<p>Who’s there? My good lord cardinal? O my Wolsey,</p>
<p>The quiet 631 of my wounded conscience:</p>
<p>Thou art a cure 632 fit for a king.— You’re welcome,</p>
<p>To Cardinal Campeius</p>
<p>Most learnèd reverend sir, into our kingdom:</p>
<p>Use us and it.— My good lord, have great care</p>
<p>To Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p>I be not found a talker 633 .</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Sir, you cannot:</p>
<p>I would your grace would give us but an hour</p>
<p>Of private conference.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII We are busy: go.</p>
<p>To Norfolk and Suffolk</p>
<p>NORFOLK This priest 634 has no pride in him?</p>
<p>Norfolk and Suffolk speak aside</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Not to speak of:</p>
<p>I would not be so sick 635 though for his place:</p>
<p>But this cannot continue.</p>
<p>NORFOLK If it do,</p>
<p>I’ll venture one have-at-him 636 .</p>
<p>SUFFOLK I another.</p>
<p>Exeunt Norfolk and Suffolk</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Your grace has given a precedent 637 of wisdom</p>
<p>Above all princes, in committing freely</p>
<p>Your scruple 638 to the voice of Christendom 639 :</p>
<p>Who can be angry now? What envy 640 reach you?</p>
<p>The Spaniard 641 , tied by blood and favour to her 642 ,</p>
<p>Must now confess 643 , if they have any goodness,</p>
<p>The trial just and noble. All the clerks 644 ,</p>
<p>I mean the learnèd ones in Christian kingdoms,</p>
<p>Have their free voices 645 . Rome, the nurse of judgement,</p>
<p>Invited by your noble self, hath sent</p>
<p>One general tongue 646 unto us: this good man,</p>
<p>This just and learnèd priest, Card’nal Campeius,</p>
<p>Whom once more I present unto your highness.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,</p>
<p>And thank the holy conclave 647 for their loves:</p>
<p>They have sent me such a man I would have wished for.</p>
<p>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS Your grace must needs deserve all strangers 648 ’
loves,</p>
<p>You are so noble: to your highness’ hand</p>
<p>I tender 649 my commission, by whose virtue 650 ,</p>
<p>The court of Rome commanding, you my lord</p>
<p>Cardinal of York, are joined with me their servant</p>
<p>In the unpartial 651 judging of this business.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Two equal men: the queen shall be acquainted</p>
<p>Forthwith for what you come. Where’s Gardiner?</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY I know your majesty has always loved her</p>
<p>So dear in heart, not to deny her that 652</p>
<p>A woman of less place 653 might ask by law:</p>
<p>Scholars allowed freely to argue for her.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Ay, and the best she shall have, and my favour</p>
<p>To him that does best, God forbid else. Cardinal,</p>
<p>Prithee call Gardiner to me, my new secretary.</p>
<p>I find him a fit 654 fellow.</p>
<p>Cardinal Wolsey calls Gardiner</p>
<p>Enter Gardiner</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Give me your hand: much joy and favour to you;</p>
<p>You are the king’s now.</p>
<p>Aside to Gardiner</p>
<p>GARDINER But to be commanded</p>
<p>Aside to Wolsey</p>
<p>For ever by your grace, whose hand has raised me.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Come hither, Gardiner.</p>
<p>[The King ] walks and whispers [with Gardiner ]</p>
<p>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS My lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace</p>
<p>In this man’s place before him?</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Yes, he was.</p>
<p>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS Was he not held a learnèd man?</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Yes, surely.</p>
<p>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS Believe me, there’s an ill opinion spread then,</p>
<p>Even of yourself, lord cardinal.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY How? Of me?</p>
<p>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS They will not stick 655 to say you envied him,</p>
<p>And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,</p>
<p>Kept him a foreign man still 656 , which so grieved him,</p>
<p>That he ran mad and died.</p>
<p>CARDINAL WOLSEY Heav’n’s peace be with him:</p>
<p>That’s Christian care enough: for living murmurers 657</p>
<p>There’s places of rebuke. He was a fool,</p>
<p>For he would needs be virtuous. That good fellow,</p>
<p>If I command him, follows my appointment 658 :</p>
<p>I will have none so near else 659 . Learn this, brother,</p>
<p>We live not to be griped 660 by meaner 661 persons.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VIII Deliver 662 this with modesty 663 to th’queen.</p>
<p>To Gardiner</p>
<p>Exit Gardiner</p>
<p>The most convenient place that I can think of</p>
<p>For such receipt of learning 664 is Blackfriars 665 :</p>
<p>There ye shall meet about this weighty business.</p>
<p>My Wolsey, see it furnished 666 . O, my lord,</p>
<p>Would it not grieve an able 667 man to leave</p>
<p>So sweet a bedfellow 668 ? But, conscience 669 , conscience:</p>
<p>O, ’tis a tender place, and I must leave her.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
