<h4 id="introduction-to-the-two-noble-kinsmen">Introduction to The Two
Noble Kinsmen</h4>
<p>The Two Noble Kinsmen , written in collaboration with John Fletcher,
is a dramatization of the first and noblest of Chaucer’s Canterbury
Tales , the tragic ‘Knight’s Tale’. Two near-brothers fall out with each
other because of their shared desire for a woman: it is a theme familiar
from many earlier Shakespearean works. Stylistic studies suggest that
Shakespeare was primarily responsible for the first and last acts,
Fletcher for the middle of the play. The most touching scenes are the
non-Chaucerian ones featuring the Jailer’s Daughter who runs mad as a
result of her unrequited love for the dashing Palamon. These sequences
were written by Fletcher in the style of Shakespeare: the junior partner
was manifestly under the influence of one of his collaborator’s most
celebrated creations: the demented Ophelia.</p>
<p>In the final act, written in the supple blank verse that is
characteristic of late Shakespeare, the kinsmen fight for Emilia by way
of chivalric single combat. Arcite dedicates himself to Mars, the god of
war, on the grounds that this will be the best way of winning the
martial contest. Palamon, on the other hand, dedicates himself to Venus,
goddess of love, on the grounds that love is at issue. Emilia admires
both men equally; she sensibly prays to Diana, goddess of chastity, that
either the one who loves her best should win or, failing this, that they
should both be killed, leaving her a perpetual virgin. There appears to
be a tragic bind: since Arcite has prayed to Mars, he will win the
joust, but since Palamon has prayed to Venus, he deserves the
love-prize. Fortune ends up playing a subtle game: in the words of
Theseus, who presides over the action, ‘the conquered triumphs, / The
victor has the loss.’ Arcite wins the day, but only for an instant: he
is mortally injured in a riding accident in his very victory parade. As
is appropriate, the romantic hero Palamon is granted his romance with
Emilia. But this ‘comic’ requital has only been made possible by the
suffering of others. ‘O cousin,’ laments Palamon, ‘That we should things
desire, which do cost us / The loss of our desire! That nought could buy
/ Dear love, but loss of dear love!’ This paradox comes to the heart of
Shakespeare and Fletcher’s tragicomic vision of the world.</p>
<p>With its wedding and funeral processions, its morris dance featuring
a countryman dressed as a baboon, and its knights prostrating themselves
before the temples of various classical deities, The Two Noble Kinsmen
appealed to the taste for spectacle that characterized the later
Jacobean theatre. The preponderance of special effects may have been the
result of its being written during the period when the Globe theatre was
being rebuilt after the fire of 1613: this seems to have been one of the
very few King’s Men plays written specifically for the smaller indoor
Blackfriars theatre, an intimate space where artificial effects could be
more precisely controlled than in the rowdy outdoor arena of the Globe.
Strikingly, the epilogue ends ‘Gentlemen, goodnight’, a reminder that
the audience at the Blackfriars, close to the Inns of Court, was much
more male-dominated than that at the Globe.</p>
<p>Although the play draws on the fashions of its time, it also looks
back to Shakespeare’s Elizabethan comedies. The title echoes The Two
Gentlemen of Verona , and the long central sequence in which assorted
love-tangles are played out in a wood outside Athens is structurally
highly reminiscent of A Midsummer Night’s Dream . At times, both the
language and the treatment of the relationship between friendship and
sexuality suggest that Shakespeare was revisiting old territory even as
he was learning from some of the new techniques of Fletcher.</p>
<p>One passage in particular takes him back into the vein of Dream and
his bestselling love-poem Venus and Adonis . Ovid’s Metamorphoses become
once again a template for reflections on desire and identity. Emilia
remembers Flavina, whom she loved as a girl, and the way that they would
each place flowers between their swelling breasts, which became an
‘innocent cradle, where phoenix-like / They died in perfume’. The dying
flower in Venus and Adonis is an emblem of unrequited love. The phoenix
and the turtle in Shakespeare’s marriage-poem published with Robert
Chester’s Loves Martyr are emblems of reciprocal love between male and
female. In Emilia’s image, the paired flowers become two phoenixes, with
the wonderful contradiction of the bird’s defining uniqueness
proclaiming the perfection of same-sex love. The speech ends with the
claim that ‘the true love ’tween maid and main may be / More than in sex
dividual’. The Two Noble Kinsmen is a tragedy because same-sex love is
disrupted by heterosexual desire and the conflicting demands of the
different gods that are enacted in the sacrifices before their altars in
the final act. The momentary fusion of the two pubescent girls
remembered by Emilia cannot be replicated between Palamon and Arcite.
Shakespeare’s final representation of sexual relations is
uncompromising. Whereas A Midsummer Night’s Dream moved towards a
celebration of the nuptials of Theseus and Hippolyta, The Two Noble
Kinsmen , from the first disruptive entry of the three widowed queens,
moves rapidly away from that union. The lost Flavina is a version of the
dead votaress whom Titania loved, but one who dies before the fall into
sexuality that brings so much confusion to Shakespeare’s comedies. She
is the mark of a yearning in Shakespeare for a kind of pre-sexual love,
free from the quest for mastery.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>AUTHORSHIP : By Shakespeare and JOHN FLETCHER . Active collaboration
is generally assumed, but the possibility of Fletcher taking over an
incomplete Shakespearean work cannot be ruled out. Most scholars agree
on the following division of labour, whereby Shakespeare wrote the
beginning and end, Fletcher the middle (including the Jailer’s Daughter
sub-plot):</p>
<p>Prologue Fletcher</p>
<p>Act 1 Shakespeare</p>
<p>2.1 Shakespeare</p>
<p>2.2–2.6 Fletcher</p>
<p>3.1–3.2 Shakespeare (some doubt about 3.2)</p>
<p>rest of Act 3 Fletcher</p>
<p>Act 4 Fletcher (some doubt about 4.2)</p>
<p>5.1 Shakespeare (some doubt about opening 38 lines)</p>
<p>5.2 Fletcher</p>
<p>5.3–5.4 Shakespeare</p>
<p>Epilogue Fletcher</p>
<p>PLOT: On the day planned for his wedding to Hippolyta, Duke Theseus
of Athens is petitioned by three queens to go to war against King Creon
of Thebes, who has deprived their dead husbands of proper burial rites.
In Thebes, the ‘two noble kinsmen’, Palamon and Arcite, realize that
their own hatred of Creon’s tyranny must be put aside while their native
city is in danger, but in spite of their valour in battle it is Theseus
who is victorious. Imprisoned in Athens, the cousins catch sight of
Hippolyta’s sister, Emilia, and both fall instantly in love with her.
Arcite is set free, but disguises himself rather than return to Thebes,
while Palamon escapes with the help of the Jailer’s Daughter, who loves
him. Meeting each other, the kinsmen agree that mortal combat between
them must decide the issue, but they are discovered by Theseus who is
persuaded to revoke his sentence of death and instead decrees that a
tournament shall decide which cousin is to be married to the indecisive
Emilia and which is to lose his head. The Jailer’s Daughter has been
driven mad by unrequited love, but accepts her former suitor when he
pretends to be Palamon. Before the tournament Arcite makes a lengthy
invocation to Mars, while Palamon prays to Venus. and Emilia to Diana –
for victory to go to the one who loves her best. Although Arcite
triumphs, he is thrown from his horse before the death sentence on
Palamon can be carried out, and with his last breath bequeaths Emilia to
his friend.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Palamon (18%/139/8), Arcite (16%/132/10), Emilia (11%/64/10),
Theseus (10%/70/9), Jailer’s Daughter (10%/54/9), Jailer (4%/64/5),
Pirithous (4%/37/9), Wooer (3%/38/3), Hippolyta (3%/25/9), Schoolmaster
(3%/19/1), Doctor (2%/30/2), First Queen (2%/12/3).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 95% verse, 5% prose.</p>
<p>DATE : 1613–14. Morris dance borrows from Francis Beaumont’s Masque
of the Inner Temple and Gray’s Inn , February 1613; alluded to in Ben
Jonson’s Bartholomew Fair (first performed October 1614); ‘our losses’
in the Prologue probably refers to the Globe fire of June 1613; probably
first performed at Blackfriars theatre in the winter season of
1613–14.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Based on Chaucer’s ‘Knight’s Tale’ (the debt is specifically
acknowledged in the Prologue, as with the debt to Gower in Pericles ).
There is no direct source for the Jailer’s Daughter sub-plot, but the
influence of Hamlet is strong. The striking opening sequence of a royal
wedding interrupted by harbingers of royal death may be shaped by recent
public events: the wedding of King James’ daughter, Princess Elizabeth,
was planned for January 1613, but postponed because of the death in
November 1612 of Prince Henry, heir to the throne.</p>
<p>TEXT: Not in the First Folio, presumably because it was thought to
belong to the canon of the living Fletcher as much as the dead
Shakespeare. Published in Quarto in 1634, as ‘Presented at the
Blackfriers by the Kings Maiesties servants, with great applause:
Written by the memorable Worthies of their time: Mr John Fletcher, and
Mr William Shakspeare. Gent[lemen]’. Thomas Cotes, the printer, also
produced a new Quarto of Pericles the following year: the two plays may
have been intended as an addendum to the Shakespeare Second Folio of
1632, which was also printed by Cotes. A well-printed text, perhaps
based on a scribal transcript of the authors’ manuscript, but with
theatrical annotation. Some of the stage directions are intended for the
book-keeper, who acted as stage manager, preparing props backstage; they
are proof of the theatrical origin of the text and of great interest in
revealing stage practice. The text was reprinted in the Second Folio
(1679) of Beaumont and Fletcher’s Comedies and Tragedies .</p>

<p>New plays and maidenheads 3 are near akin:</p>

<p>Yet still is Modesty, and still retains</p>
<p>More of the maid, to sight, than husband’s pains 10 .</p>
