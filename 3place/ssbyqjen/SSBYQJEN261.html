continues</h4>
<p>Flourish. Enter King, Old Lady [Countess ], Lafew, the two French
Lords, with Attendants</p>
<p>KING We lost a jewel of 1639 her, and our esteem 1640</p>
<p>Was made much poorer by it: but your son,</p>
<p>As mad in folly, lacked the sense to know</p>
<p>Her estimation home 1641 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS ’Tis past, my liege,</p>
<p>And I beseech your majesty to make 1642 it</p>
<p>Natural 1643 rebellion, done i’th’blade 1644 of youth,</p>
<p>When oil and fire, too strong for reason’s force,</p>
<p>O’erbears it and burns on.</p>
<p>KING My honoured lady,</p>
<p>I have forgiven and forgotten all,</p>
<p>Though my revenges were high bent 1645 upon him,</p>
<p>And watched 1646 the time to shoot.</p>
<p>LAFEW This I must say,</p>
<p>But first I beg my pardon 1647 , the young lord</p>
<p>Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady</p>
<p>Offence of mighty note; but to himself</p>
<p>The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife</p>
<p>Whose beauty did astonish 1648 the survey 1649</p>
<p>Of richest 1650 eyes, whose words all ears took captive,</p>
<p>Whose dear perfection hearts that scorned to serve</p>
<p>Humbly called mistress.</p>
<p>KING Praising what is lost</p>
<p>Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither.</p>
<p>We are reconciled, and the first view 1651 shall kill</p>
<p>All repetition 1652 . Let him not ask our pardon.</p>
<p>The nature of his great offence is dead 1653 ,</p>
<p>And deeper than oblivion we do bury</p>
<p>Th’incensing relics 1654 of it. Let him approach</p>
<p>A stranger 1655 , no offender; and inform him</p>
<p>So ’tis our will he should.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN 1656 I shall, my liege.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>KING What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?</p>
<p>To Lafew</p>
<p>LAFEW All that he is hath reference to 1657 your highness.</p>
<p>KING Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me</p>
<p>That sets him high in fame.</p>
<p>Enter Count Bertram</p>
<p>With a patch of velvet on his left cheek</p>
<p>LAFEW He looks well on’t.</p>
<p>KING I am not a day of season 1658 1659 ,</p>
<p>For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail</p>
<p>In me at once. But to the brightest beams</p>
<p>Distracted 1660 clouds give way, so stand thou forth.</p>
<p>The time is fair again.</p>
<p>BERTRAM My high-repented blames 1661 ,</p>
<p>Dear sovereign, pardon to 1662 me.</p>
<p>KING All is whole 1663 .</p>
<p>Not one word more of the consumèd 1664 time.</p>
<p>Let’s take the instant by the forward top 1665 ,</p>
<p>For we are old, and on our quick’st 1666 decrees</p>
<p>Th’inaudible and noiseless foot of time</p>
<p>Steals ere we can effect them. You remember</p>
<p>The daughter of this lord?</p>
<p>BERTRAM Admiringly, my liege. At first</p>
<p>I stuck 1667 my choice upon her, ere my heart</p>
<p>Durst 1668 make too bold a herald 1669 of my tongue,</p>
<p>Where 1670 the impression 1671 of mine eye infixing 1672 ,</p>
<p>Contempt his scornful perspective 1673 did lend me,</p>
<p>Which warped the line of every other favour 1674 ,</p>
<p>Scorned a fair colour 1675 , or expressed 1676 it stol’n 1677 ,</p>
<p>Extended or contracted 1678 all proportions</p>
<p>To a most hideous object 1679 . Thence it came</p>
<p>That she 1680 whom all men praised and whom myself,</p>
<p>Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye</p>
<p>The dust that did offend it.</p>
<p>KING Well excused.</p>
<p>That thou didst love her, strikes some scores 1681 away</p>
<p>From the great count 1682 . But love that comes too late,</p>
<p>Like a remorseful 1683 pardon 1684 slowly carried 1685 ,</p>
<p>To the great sender turns 1686 a sour offence,</p>
<p>Crying, ‘That’s good that’s gone.’ Our rash faults</p>
<p>Make trivial price 1687 of serious things we have,</p>
<p>Not knowing 1688 them until we know their grave 1689 .</p>
<p>Oft our displeasures 1690 , to ourselves unjust,</p>
<p>Destroy our friends and after weep 1691 their dust 1692 .</p>
<p>Our own love waking cries to see what’s done,</p>
<p>While shameful hate sleeps out 1693 the afternoon.</p>
<p>Be this sweet Helen’s knell 1694 , and now forget her.</p>
<p>Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin 1695 .</p>
<p>The main consents 1696 are had, and here we’ll stay</p>
<p>To see our widower’s second marriage day,</p>
<p>Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!</p>
<p>Or, ere they meet 1697 , in me, O nature, cesse 1698 !</p>
<p>LAFEW Come on, my son, in whom my house’s name</p>
<p>Must be digested 1699 , give a favour 1700 from you</p>
<p>To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,</p>
<p>That she may quickly come 1701 .</p>
<p>Bertram gives Lafew a ring</p>
<p>By my old beard,</p>
<p>And every hair that’s on’t, Helen, that’s dead,</p>
<p>Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,</p>
<p>The last 1702 that e’er I took her leave 1703 at court,</p>
<p>I saw upon her finger.</p>
<p>BERTRAM Hers it was not.</p>
<p>KING Now, pray you let me see it. For mine eye,</p>
<p>Lafew gives it to him</p>
<p>While I was speaking, oft was fastened to’t.</p>
<p>This ring was mine, and when I gave it Helen,</p>
<p>I bade 1704 her, if her fortunes ever stood</p>
<p>Necessitied to 1705 help, that by this token</p>
<p>I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave 1706 her</p>
<p>Of what should stead 1707 her most?</p>
<p>BERTRAM My gracious sovereign,</p>
<p>Howe’er it pleases you to take it so,</p>
<p>The ring was never hers.</p>
<p>COUNTESS Son, on my life,</p>
<p>I have seen her wear it, and she reckoned 1708 it</p>
<p>At 1709 her life’s rate 1710 .</p>
<p>LAFEW I am sure I saw her wear it.</p>
<p>BERTRAM You are deceived, my lord. She never saw it.</p>
<p>In Florence was it from a casement 1711 thrown me,</p>
<p>Wrapped in a paper, which contained the name</p>
<p>Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought</p>
<p>I stood engaged 1712 , but when I had subscribed</p>
<p>To 1713 mine own fortune and informed her fully</p>
<p>I could not answer in that course of honour</p>
<p>As she had made the overture 1714 , she ceased</p>
<p>In heavy satisfaction 1715 and would never</p>
<p>Receive the ring again.</p>
<p>KING Plutus 1716 himself,</p>
<p>That knows the tinct 1717 and multiplying med’cine 1718 ,</p>
<p>Hath not in nature’s mystery more science 1719</p>
<p>Than I have in this ring. ’Twas mine, ’twas Helen’s,</p>
<p>Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know</p>
<p>That you are well acquainted with yourself,</p>
<p>Confess ’twas hers, and by what rough enforcement</p>
<p>You got it from her. She called the saints to surety 1720</p>
<p>That she would never put it from her finger,</p>
<p>Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,</p>
<p>Where you have never come, or sent it us</p>
<p>Upon her great disaster 1721 .</p>
<p>BERTRAM She never saw it.</p>
<p>KING Thou speak’st it falsely, as I love mine honour,</p>
<p>And mak’st conjectural 1722 fears to come into me</p>
<p>Which I would fain 1723 shut out. If it should prove</p>
<p>That thou art so inhuman — ’twill not prove so —</p>
<p>And yet I know not. Thou didst hate her deadly,</p>
<p>And she is dead, which nothing but to close</p>
<p>Her eyes myself could win me to believe,</p>
<p>More than to see this ring. Take him away.</p>
<p>↓↑ Puts ring on his own finger ↓↑</p>
<p>My fore-past 1724 proofs, howe’er the matter fall 1725 ,</p>
<p>Shall tax my fears of little vanity 1726 1727 ,</p>
<p>Having vainly feared too little. Away with him.</p>
<p>We’ll sift 1728 this matter further.</p>
<p>BERTRAM If you shall prove</p>
<p>This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy</p>
<p>Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,</p>
<p>Where yet she never was.</p>
<p>[Exit, guarded ]</p>
<p>Enter a Gentleman [the Astringer 1729 ]</p>
<p>KING I am wrapped in dismal thinkings.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Gracious sovereign,</p>
<p>Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:</p>
<p>Here’s a petition from a Florentine,</p>
<p>Who hath for 1730 four or five removes 1731 come short 1732</p>
<p>To tender 1733 it herself. I undertook it,</p>
<p>Vanquished 1734 thereto by the fair grace and speech</p>
<p>Of the poor suppliant, who by this 1735 I know</p>
<p>Is here attending. Her business looks 1736 in her</p>
<p>With an importing visage 1737 , and she told me,</p>
<p>In a sweet verbal brief 1738 , it did concern</p>
<p>Your highness with herself.</p>
<p>KING</p>
<p>[Reads a ] letter</p>
<p>’Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, I
blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rossillion a widower. His
vows are forfeited to me, and my honour’s paid 1739 to him. He stole
from Florence, taking no leave 1740 , and I follow him to his country
for justice. Grant it me, O king! In you it best lies, otherwise a
seducer flourishes and a poor maid is undone. Diana</p>
<p>Capilet.’</p>
<p>LAFEW I will buy me a son-in-law in 1741 a fair 1742 , and toll for
this 1743 . I’ll none of him.</p>
<p>KING The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafew,</p>
<p>To bring forth this discov’ry. Seek these suitors 1744 .</p>
<p>Go speedily and bring again the count.</p>
<p>Enter Bertram [guarded ]</p>
<p>I am afeard 1745 the life of Helen, lady,</p>
<p>Was foully snatched 1746 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS Now, justice on the doers!</p>
<p>KING I wonder, sir, sith 1747 wives are monsters to you,</p>
<p>And that 1748 you fly them as you swear them lordship 1749 ,</p>
<p>Yet you desire to marry.— What woman’s that?</p>
<p>Enter Widow [and ] Diana</p>
<p>DIANA I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,</p>
<p>Derivèd 1750 from the ancient Capilet.</p>
<p>My suit, as I do understand, you know,</p>
<p>And therefore know how far I may be pitied.</p>
<p>WIDOW I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour</p>
<p>Both suffer under this complaint we bring,</p>
<p>And both shall cease 1751 , without your remedy.</p>
<p>KING Come hither, count. Do you know these women?</p>
<p>BERTRAM My lord, I neither can nor will deny</p>
<p>But that I know them. Do they charge me further?</p>
<p>DIANA Why do you look so strange 1752 upon your wife?</p>
<p>BERTRAM She’s none of mine, my lord.</p>
<p>DIANA If you shall marry,</p>
<p>You give away this hand 1753 , and that is mine,</p>
<p>You give away heaven’s vows, and those are mine,</p>
<p>You give away myself, which is known mine,</p>
<p>For I by vow am so embodied yours 1754 ,</p>
<p>That she which marries you must marry me,</p>
<p>Either both or none.</p>
<p>LAFEW Your reputation comes too short for my daughter. You are no
husband for her.</p>
<p>To Bertram</p>
<p>BERTRAM My lord, this is a fond 1755 and desp’rate creature,</p>
<p>Whom sometime I have laughed with. Let your highness</p>
<p>Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour</p>
<p>Than for to think that I would sink it here.</p>
<p>KING Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend 1756</p>
<p>Till your deeds gain them 1757 : fairer prove your honour</p>
<p>Than in my thought it lies.</p>
<p>DIANA Good my lord,</p>
<p>Ask him upon his oath, if he does think</p>
<p>He had not my virginity.</p>
<p>KING What say’st thou to her?</p>
<p>BERTRAM She’s impudent 1758 , my lord,</p>
<p>And was a common gamester 1759 to the camp.</p>
<p>DIANA He does me wrong, my lord. If I were so,</p>
<p>He might have bought me at a common price.</p>
<p>Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,</p>
<p>Shows a ring</p>
<p>Whose high respect and rich validity 1760</p>
<p>Did lack a parallel 1761 . Yet for all that</p>
<p>He gave it to a commoner 1762 o’th’camp,</p>
<p>If I be one.</p>
<p>COUNTESS He blushes, and ’tis hit 1763 .</p>
<p>Of 1764 six preceding ancestors, that gem,</p>
<p>Conferred by testament 1765 to th’sequent issue 1766 ,</p>
<p>Hath it been owed 1767 and worn. This is his wife,</p>
<p>That ring’s a thousand proofs.</p>
<p>KING Methought you said</p>
<p>You saw one here in court could witness it.</p>
<p>DIANA I did, my lord, but loath am to produce</p>
<p>So bad an instrument 1768 : his name’s Parolles.</p>
<p>LAFEW I saw the man today, if man he be.</p>
<p>KING Find him, and bring him hither.</p>
<p>[Exit an Attendant ]</p>
<p>BERTRAM What of him?</p>
<p>He’s quoted for 1769 a most perfidious 1770 slave</p>
<p>With 1771 all the spots 1772 o’th’world taxed 1773 and deboshed 1774
,</p>
<p>Whose nature sickens but 1775 to speak a truth.</p>
<p>Am I or that or this for 1776 what he’ll utter,</p>
<p>That will speak anything?</p>
<p>KING She hath that ring of yours.</p>
<p>BERTRAM I think she has; certain it is I liked her,</p>
<p>And boarded 1777 her i’th’wanton 1778 way of youth.</p>
<p>She knew her distance 1779 and did angle for me,</p>
<p>Madding 1780 my eagerness with her restraint,</p>
<p>As all impediments in fancy’s 1781 course</p>
<p>Are motives of more fancy. And in fine,</p>
<p>Her insuite 1782 cunning, with her modern 1783 grace,</p>
<p>Subdued me 1784 to her rate 1785 : she got the ring,</p>
<p>And I had that which any inferior might</p>
<p>At market-price have bought.</p>
<p>DIANA I must be patient.</p>
<p>You, that have turned 1786 off a first so noble wife,</p>
<p>May justly diet 1787 me. I pray you yet —</p>
<p>Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband —</p>
<p>Send for your ring, I will return it home,</p>
<p>And give me mine again.</p>
<p>BERTRAM I have it not.</p>
<p>KING What ring was yours, I pray you?</p>
<p>DIANA Sir, much like the same upon your finger.</p>
<p>KING Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.</p>
<p>DIANA And this was it I gave him, being abed.</p>
<p>KING The story then goes 1788 false, you threw it him</p>
<p>Out of a casement.</p>
<p>DIANA I have spoke the truth.</p>
<p>Enter Parolles</p>
<p>BERTRAM My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.</p>
<p>KING You boggle 1789 shrewdly 1790 , every feather starts 1791
you.</p>
<p>Is this the man you speak of?</p>
<p>DIANA Ay, my lord.</p>
<p>KING Tell me, sirrah — but tell me true, I charge you,</p>
<p>To Parolles</p>
<p>Not fearing the displeasure of your master,</p>
<p>Which on your just proceeding 1792 I’ll keep off —</p>
<p>By 1793 him and by this woman here what know you?</p>
<p>PAROLLES So please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable
gentleman. Tricks 1794 he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.</p>
<p>KING Come, come, to th’purpose: did he love this woman?</p>
<p>PAROLLES Faith, sir, he did love her, but how?</p>
<p>KING How, I pray you?</p>
<p>PAROLLES He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.</p>
<p>KING How is that?</p>
<p>PAROLLES He loved her, sir, and loved her not 1795 .</p>
<p>KING As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an equivocal companion
1796 is this!</p>
<p>PAROLLES I am a poor man, and at your majesty’s command.</p>
<p>LAFEW He’s a good drum 1797 , my lord, but a naughty 1798 orator.</p>
<p>DIANA Do you know he promised me marriage?</p>
<p>PAROLLES Faith, I know more than I’ll speak.</p>
<p>KING But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?</p>
<p>PAROLLES Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them, as I
said. But more than that, he loved her, for indeed he was mad for her
and talked of Satan and of Limbo 1799 and of Furies 1800 and I know not
what. Yet I was in that credit with them 1801 at that time that I knew
of their going to bed, and of other motions 1802 , as promising her
marriage, and things which would derive 1803 me ill will to speak of:
therefore I will not speak what I know.</p>
<p>KING Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are
married. But thou art too fine 1804 in thy evidence: therefore stand
aside. This ring, you say, was yours?</p>
<p>DIANA Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p>KING Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?</p>
<p>DIANA It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.</p>
<p>KING Who lent it you?</p>
<p>DIANA It was not lent me neither.</p>
<p>KING Where did you find it, then?</p>
<p>DIANA I found it not.</p>
<p>KING If it were yours by none of all these ways,</p>
<p>How could you give it him?</p>
<p>DIANA I never gave it him.</p>
<p>LAFEW This woman’s an easy 1805 glove 1806 , my lord: she goes off
and on 1807 at pleasure 1808 .</p>
<p>KING This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.</p>
<p>DIANA It might be yours or hers, for aught 1809 I know.</p>
<p>KING Take her away. I do not like her now.</p>
<p>To prison with her, and away with him.</p>
<p>Unless thou tell’st me where thou hadst this ring,</p>
<p>Thou diest within this hour.</p>
<p>DIANA I’ll never tell you.</p>
<p>KING Take her away.</p>
<p>DIANA I’ll put in 1810 bail, my liege.</p>
<p>KING I think thee now some common customer 1811 .</p>
<p>DIANA By Jove, if ever I knew 1812 man, ’twas you 1813 .</p>
<p>KING Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?</p>
<p>DIANA Because he’s guilty, and he is not guilty.</p>
<p>He knows I am no maid, and he’ll swear to’t.</p>
<p>I’ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.</p>
<p>Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life.</p>
<p>I am either maid, or else this old man’s wife.</p>
<p>Points to Lafew</p>
<p>KING She does abuse our ears. To prison with her.</p>
<p>DIANA Good mother, fetch my bail.— Stay, royal sir.</p>
<p>[Exit Widow ]</p>
<p>The jeweller that owes 1814 the ring is sent for,</p>
<p>And he shall surety 1815 me. But for 1816 this lord</p>
<p>Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,</p>
<p>Though yet he never harmed me, here I quit 1817 him.</p>
<p>He knows himself my bed he hath defiled,</p>
<p>And at that time he got his wife with child.</p>
<p>Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick.</p>
<p>So there’s my riddle: one that’s dead is quick 1818 ,</p>
<p>And now behold the meaning.</p>
<p>Enter Helen and Widow</p>
<p>KING Is there no exorcist</p>
<p>Beguiles 1819 the truer office 1820 of mine eyes?</p>
<p>Is’t real that I see?</p>
<p>HELEN No, my good lord,</p>
<p>’Tis but the shadow 1821 of a wife you see,</p>
<p>The name and not the thing.</p>
<p>BERTRAM Both, both. O, pardon!</p>
<p>HELEN O my good lord, when I was like 1822 this maid,</p>
<p>I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,</p>
<p>And, look you, here’s your letter. This it says:</p>
<p>Shows letter</p>
<p>’When from my finger you can get this ring</p>
<p>And are by me with child’, etc. This is done:</p>
<p>Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?</p>
<p>BERTRAM If she, my liege, can make me know 1823 this clearly,</p>
<p>I’ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.</p>
<p>HELEN If it appear not plain and prove untrue,</p>
<p>Deadly divorce 1824 step between me and you!</p>
<p>O my dear mother, do I see you living?</p>
<p>LAFEW Mine eyes smell onions. I shall weep anon:</p>
<p>Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher 1825 .</p>
<p>To Parolles</p>
<p>So. I thank thee. Wait on 1826 me home, I’ll make sport 1827 with
thee.</p>
<p>Let thy court’sies 1828 alone, they are scurvy ones.</p>
<p>KING Let us from point to point this story know,</p>
<p>To make the even 1829 truth in pleasure flow.—</p>
<p>If thou be’st yet a fresh uncroppèd flower,</p>
<p>To Diana</p>
<p>Choose thou thy husband, and I’ll pay thy dower,</p>
<p>For I can guess that by thy honest aid</p>
<p>Thou kept’st a wife herself, thyself a maid.—</p>
<p>Of that and all the progress more and less 1830</p>
<p>Resolvedly 1831 more leisure shall express.</p>
<p>All yet seems well, and if it end so meet 1832 ,</p>
<p>The bitter past 1833 , more welcome is the sweet.</p>
<p>Flourish</p>
<p>[Epilogue]</p>
<p>The king’s a beggar now the play is done.</p>
<p>All is well ended if this suit be won,</p>
<p>That you express content 1834 , which we will pay</p>
<p>With strife 1835 to please you, day exceeding 1836 day.</p>
<p>Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts 1837 ,</p>
<p>Your gentle hands lend us 1838 , and take our hearts 1839 .</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster , and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading ‘bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
