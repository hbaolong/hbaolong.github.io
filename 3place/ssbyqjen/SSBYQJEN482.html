17</h4>
<p>Enter Malcolm and Macduff</p>
<p>MALCOLM Let us seek out some desolate 1128 shade 1129 , and there</p>
<p>Weep our sad bosoms empty.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Let us rather</p>
<p>Hold fast 1130 the mortal 1131 sword, and like good men</p>
<p>Bestride our downfall birthdom 1132 . Each new morn</p>
<p>New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows</p>
<p>Strike heaven on the face, that 1133 it resounds</p>
<p>As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out</p>
<p>Like syllable of dolour 1134 .</p>
<p>MALCOLM What I believe I’ll wail 1135 ;</p>
<p>What know, believe; and what I can redress,</p>
<p>As I shall find the time to friend 1136 , I will.</p>
<p>What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance 1137 .</p>
<p>This tyrant, whose sole name 1138 blisters our tongues,</p>
<p>Was once thought honest 1139 . You have loved him well:</p>
<p>He hath not touched 1140 you yet. I am young, but something</p>
<p>You may discern of him through me 1141 , and wisdom 1142</p>
<p>To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb</p>
<p>T’appease an angry god 1143 .</p>
<p>MACDUFF I am not treacherous.</p>
<p>MALCOLM But Macbeth is.</p>
<p>A good and virtuous nature may recoil 1144</p>
<p>In an imperial charge 1145 1146 . But I shall crave your pardon:</p>
<p>That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose 1147 ;</p>
<p>Angels are bright still, though the brightest 1148 fell:</p>
<p>Though all things foul 1149 would wear the brows of grace 1150 ,</p>
<p>Yet grace must still look so 1151 .</p>
<p>MACDUFF I have lost my hopes.</p>
<p>MALCOLM Perchance even there 1152 where I did find my doubts 1153
.</p>
<p>Why in that rawness 1154 left you wife and child,</p>
<p>Those precious motives 1155 , those strong knots of love,</p>
<p>Without leave-taking 1156 ? I pray you,</p>
<p>Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,</p>
<p>But mine own safeties 1157 . You may be rightly just,</p>
<p>Whatever I shall think.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Bleed, bleed, poor country!</p>
<p>Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure 1158 ,</p>
<p>For goodness dare not check 1159 thee: wear thou thy wrongs,</p>
<p>The title is affeered 1160 !— Fare thee well, lord.</p>
<p>I would not be the villain that thou think’st</p>
<p>For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp,</p>
<p>And the rich east to boot 1161 .</p>
<p>MALCOLM Be not offended:</p>
<p>I speak not as in absolute fear of you.</p>
<p>I think our country sinks beneath the yoke 1162 :</p>
<p>It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash</p>
<p>Is added to her wounds. I think withal 1163</p>
<p>There would be hands uplifted in my right 1164 ,</p>
<p>And here from gracious England 1165 have I offer</p>
<p>Of goodly thousands 1166 : but, for all this,</p>
<p>When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,</p>
<p>Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country</p>
<p>Shall have more vices than it had before,</p>
<p>More suffer, and more sundry 1167 ways than ever,</p>
<p>By him that shall succeed 1168 .</p>
<p>MACDUFF What 1169 should he be?</p>
<p>MALCOLM It is myself I mean, in whom I know</p>
<p>All the particulars 1170 of vice so grafted 1171</p>
<p>That, when they shall be opened 1172 , black Macbeth</p>
<p>Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state</p>
<p>Esteem 1173 him as a lamb, being compared</p>
<p>With my confineless 1174 harms.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Not in the legions 1175</p>
<p>Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned</p>
<p>In evils to top 1176 Macbeth.</p>
<p>MALCOLM I grant him bloody,</p>
<p>Luxurious 1177 , avaricious 1178 , false, deceitful,</p>
<p>Sudden 1179 , malicious, smacking of every sin</p>
<p>That has a name, but there’s no bottom, none,</p>
<p>In my voluptuousness 1180 : your wives, your daughters,</p>
<p>Your matrons 1181 and your maids 1182 , could not fill up</p>
<p>The cistern 1183 of my lust, and my desire</p>
<p>All continent 1184 impediments would o’erbear 1185</p>
<p>That did oppose my will 1186 . Better Macbeth</p>
<p>Than such an one to reign.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Boundless intemperance</p>
<p>In nature is a tyranny 1187 : it hath been</p>
<p>Th’untimely emptying of the happy throne</p>
<p>And fall of many kings. But fear not yet</p>
<p>To take upon you what is yours 1188 : you may</p>
<p>Convey 1189 your pleasures in a spacious plenty,</p>
<p>And yet seem cold 1190 . The time you may so hoodwink 1191 .</p>
<p>We have willing dames enough: there cannot be</p>
<p>That vulture in you to devour so many</p>
<p>As will to greatness dedicate themselves,</p>
<p>Finding it so inclined 1192 .</p>
<p>MALCOLM With this there grows</p>
<p>In my most ill-composed affection 1193 such</p>
<p>A stanchless 1194 avarice that, were I king,</p>
<p>I should cut off 1195 the nobles for their lands,</p>
<p>Desire his 1196 jewels and this other’s house:</p>
<p>And my more-having 1197 would be as a sauce</p>
<p>To make me hunger more, that I should forge 1198</p>
<p>Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,</p>
<p>Destroying them for wealth.</p>
<p>MACDUFF This avarice</p>
<p>Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root</p>
<p>Than summer-seeming 1199 lust, and it hath been</p>
<p>The sword of our slain kings 1200 . Yet do not fear:</p>
<p>Scotland hath foisons 1201 to fill up your will</p>
<p>Of your mere own 1202 . All these 1203 are portable 1204 ,</p>
<p>With other graces weighed 1205 .</p>
<p>MALCOLM But I have none. The king-becoming 1206 graces,</p>
<p>As justice, verity 1207 , temp’rance 1208 , stableness,</p>
<p>Bounty 1209 , perseverance, mercy, lowliness 1210 ,</p>
<p>Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,</p>
<p>I have no relish 1211 of them, but abound</p>
<p>In the division 1212 of each several 1213 crime 1214 ,</p>
<p>Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should</p>
<p>Pour the sweet milk of concord 1215 into hell,</p>
<p>Uproar 1216 the universal peace, confound</p>
<p>All unity on earth.</p>
<p>MACDUFF O Scotland, Scotland!</p>
<p>MALCOLM If such a one be fit to govern, speak:</p>
<p>I am as I have spoken.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Fit to govern?</p>
<p>No, not to live. O nation miserable,</p>
<p>With an untitled 1217 tyrant bloody-sceptred,</p>
<p>When shalt thou see thy wholesome 1218 days again,</p>
<p>Since that the truest issue of thy throne</p>
<p>By his own interdiction 1219 stands accused</p>
<p>And does blaspheme 1220 his breed 1221 ?— Thy royal father</p>
<p>Was a most sainted 1222 king: the queen that bore thee,</p>
<p>Oft’ner upon her knees 1223 than on her feet,</p>
<p>Died every day she lived 1224 . Fare thee well.</p>
<p>These evils thou repeat’st upon 1225 thyself</p>
<p>Hath banished me from Scotland 1226 .— O my breast,</p>
<p>Thy hope ends here!</p>
<p>MALCOLM Macduff, this noble passion,</p>
<p>Child of integrity, hath from my soul</p>
<p>Wiped the black scruples 1227 , reconciled my thoughts</p>
<p>To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth</p>
<p>By many of these trains 1228 hath sought to win me</p>
<p>Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks 1229 me</p>
<p>From over-credulous 1230 haste: but God above</p>
<p>Deal between thee and me! For even now</p>
<p>I put myself to thy direction 1231 and</p>
<p>Unspeak mine own detraction 1232 : here abjure 1233</p>
<p>The taints 1234 and blames I laid upon myself</p>
<p>For 1235 strangers to my nature. I am yet</p>
<p>Unknown to woman 1236 , never was forsworn 1237 ,</p>
<p>Scarcely have coveted what was mine own 1238 ,</p>
<p>At no time broke my faith, would not betray</p>
<p>The devil to his fellow, and delight</p>
<p>No less in truth than life. My first false speaking 1239</p>
<p>Was this upon myself 1240 . What I am truly</p>
<p>Is thine and my poor country’s to command:</p>
<p>Whither indeed, before thy here-approach 1241 ,</p>
<p>Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men,</p>
<p>Already at a point 1242 , was setting forth.</p>
<p>Now we’ll 1243 together, and the chance of goodness</p>
<p>Be like our warranted quarrel 1244 . Why are you silent?</p>
<p>MACDUFF Such welcome and unwelcome things at once</p>
<p>’Tis hard to reconcile.</p>
<p>Enter a Doctor</p>
<p>MALCOLM Well, more anon.— Comes the king forth, I pray you?</p>
<p>DOCTOR Ay, sir, there are a crew of wretched souls</p>
<p>That stay 1245 his cure 1246 : their malady convinces 1247</p>
<p>The great assay of art 1248 , but at his touch —</p>
<p>Such sanctity 1249 hath heaven given his hand —</p>
<p>They presently amend 1250 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>MALCOLM I thank you, doctor.</p>
<p>MACDUFF What’s the disease he means?</p>
<p>MALCOLM ’Tis called the evil 1251 :</p>
<p>A most miraculous work in this good king,</p>
<p>Which often, since my here-remain 1252 in England,</p>
<p>I have seen him do. How he solicits 1253 heaven</p>
<p>Himself best knows: but strangely-visited 1254 people,</p>
<p>All swoll’n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,</p>
<p>The mere 1255 despair of surgery, he cures,</p>
<p>Hanging a golden stamp 1256 about their necks</p>
<p>Put on with holy prayers: and ’tis spoken 1257 ,</p>
<p>To the succeeding royalty 1258 he leaves</p>
<p>The healing benediction 1259 . With this strange 1260 virtue</p>
<p>He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,</p>
<p>And sundry blessings hang about his throne</p>
<p>That speak him 1261 full of grace.</p>
<p>Enter Ross</p>
<p>MACDUFF See who comes here.</p>
<p>MALCOLM My countryman 1262 , but yet I know 1263 him not.</p>
<p>MACDUFF My ever-gentle 1264 cousin, welcome hither.</p>
<p>MALCOLM I know him now. Good God betimes 1265 remove</p>
<p>The means 1266 that makes us strangers!</p>
<p>ROSS Sir, amen.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Stands Scotland where it did?</p>
<p>ROSS Alas, poor country,</p>
<p>Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot</p>
<p>Be called our mother, but our grave; where nothing</p>
<p>But who knows nothing 1267 is once seen to smile:</p>
<p>Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air</p>
<p>Are made, not marked 1268 : where violent sorrow seems</p>
<p>A modern ecstasy 1269 . The dead man’s knell</p>
<p>Is there scarce asked for who 1270 , and good men’s lives</p>
<p>Expire before the flowers in their caps,</p>
<p>Dying or ere they sicken 1271 .</p>
<p>MACDUFF O, relation 1272 too nice 1273 , and yet too true!</p>
<p>MALCOLM What’s the newest grief?</p>
<p>ROSS That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker 1274 :</p>
<p>Each minute teems 1275 a new one.</p>
<p>MACDUFF How does my wife?</p>
<p>ROSS Why, well.</p>
<p>MACDUFF And all my children?</p>
<p>ROSS Well, too.</p>
<p>MACDUFF The tyrant has not battered at their peace?</p>
<p>ROSS No, they were well at peace 1276 when I did leave ’em.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Be not a niggard of 1277 your speech: how goes’t?</p>
<p>ROSS When I came hither to transport the tidings</p>
<p>Which I have heavily 1278 borne, there ran a rumour</p>
<p>Of many worthy fellows that were out 1279 ,</p>
<p>Which was to my belief witnessed the rather 1280 ,</p>
<p>For that I saw the tyrant’s power 1281 afoot 1282 .</p>
<p>Now is the time of help.— Your eye 1283 in Scotland</p>
<p>To Malcolm</p>
<p>Would create soldiers, make our women fight,</p>
<p>To doff 1284 their dire distresses.</p>
<p>MALCOLM Be’t 1285 their comfort</p>
<p>We are coming thither. Gracious England hath</p>
<p>Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men:</p>
<p>An older and a better soldier none</p>
<p>That Christendom gives out 1286 1287 .</p>
<p>ROSS Would I could answer</p>
<p>This comfort with the like 1288 . But I have words</p>
<p>That would 1289 be howled out in the desert 1290 air,</p>
<p>Where hearing should not latch 1291 them.</p>
<p>MACDUFF What concern they?</p>
<p>The general cause 1292 ? Or is it a fee-grief 1293</p>
<p>Due to some single breast?</p>
<p>ROSS No mind that’s honest</p>
<p>But in it shares some woe, though the main part</p>
<p>Pertains to you alone.</p>
<p>MACDUFF If it be mine,</p>
<p>Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.</p>
<p>ROSS Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,</p>
<p>Which shall possess them with 1294 the heaviest 1295 sound</p>
<p>That ever yet they heard.</p>
<p>MACDUFF Hum! I guess at it.</p>
<p>ROSS Your castle is surprised 1296 , your wife and babes</p>
<p>Savagely slaughtered: to relate the manner 1297</p>
<p>Were, on the quarry 1298 of these murdered deer 1299 ,</p>
<p>To add the death of you.</p>
<p>MALCOLM Merciful heaven!</p>
<p>What, man, ne’er pull your hat upon your brows 1300 :</p>
<p>Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak</p>
<p>Whispers 1301 the o’er-fraught 1302 heart and bids it break.</p>
<p>MACDUFF My children too?</p>
<p>ROSS Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.</p>
<p>MACDUFF And I must be from thence 1303 ! My wife killed too?</p>
<p>ROSS I have said.</p>
<p>MALCOLM Be comforted:</p>
<p>Let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge,</p>
<p>To cure this deadly grief.</p>
<p>MACDUFF He 1304 has no children.— All my pretty ones?</p>
<p>Did you say all? O hell-kite 1305 ! All?</p>
<p>What, all my pretty chickens and their dam 1306</p>
<p>At one fell swoop 1307 ?</p>
<p>MALCOLM Dispute 1308 it like a man.</p>
<p>MACDUFF I shall do so,</p>
<p>But I must also feel it as a man:</p>
<p>I cannot but remember such things were</p>
<p>That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on</p>
<p>And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,</p>
<p>They were all struck 1309 for thee! Naught 1310 that I am,</p>
<p>Not for their own demerits 1311 , but for mine,</p>
<p>Fell 1312 slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!</p>
<p>MALCOLM Be this the whetstone 1313 of your sword. Let grief</p>
<p>Convert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it.</p>
<p>MACDUFF O, I could play the woman with mine eyes 1314</p>
<p>And braggart 1315 with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,</p>
<p>Cut short all intermission 1316 . Front to front 1317</p>
<p>Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself:</p>
<p>Within my sword’s length set him. If he scape 1318 ,</p>
<p>Heaven forgive him too!</p>
<p>MALCOLM This tune 1319 goes manly.</p>
<p>Come, go we to the king. Our power 1320 is ready:</p>
<p>Our lack is nothing but our leave 1321 . Macbeth</p>
<p>Is ripe for shaking 1322 , and the powers above 1323</p>
<p>Put on their instruments 1324 . Receive what cheer you may:</p>
<p>The night is long that never finds the day.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
