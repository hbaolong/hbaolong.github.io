1254</h4>
<p>Enter Paris and his Page</p>
<p>Carrying flowers and a torch</p>
<p>PARIS Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof 1255 .</p>
<p>Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.</p>
<p>Under yon yew trees lay thee all along 1256 Being 1257 ,</p>
<p>Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground,</p>
<p>So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,</p>
<p>Being loose, unfirm with digging up of graves,</p>
<p>But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me</p>
<p>As signal that thou hear’st something approach.</p>
<p>Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.</p>
<p>PAGE I am almost afraid to stand 1258 alone</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Here in the churchyard, yet I will adventure 1259 .</p>
<p>Stands back</p>
<p>PARIS Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew —</p>
<p>Strews flowers and sprinkles perfumed water</p>
<p>O woe, thy canopy 1260 is dust and stones —</p>
<p>Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,</p>
<p>Or wanting that, with tears distilled by moans;</p>
<p>The obsequies 1261 that I for thee will keep</p>
<p>Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.</p>
<p>Whistle Boy</p>
<p>The boy gives warning something doth approach.</p>
<p>What cursèd foot wanders this way tonight,</p>
<p>To cross 1262 my obsequies and true love’s rite?</p>
<p>What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.</p>
<p>Stands back</p>
<p>Enter Romeo and Balthasar</p>
<p>Carrying a mattock and wrenching iron</p>
<p>ROMEO Give me that mattock 1263 and the wrenching iron 1264 .</p>
<p>Hold, take this letter: early in the morning</p>
<p>Gives a letter</p>
<p>See thou deliver it to my lord and father.</p>
<p>Give me the light. Upon thy life, I charge thee,</p>
<p>Takes a torch</p>
<p>Whate’er thou hear’st or see’st, stand all aloof,</p>
<p>And do not interrupt me in my course.</p>
<p>Why I descend into this bed of death</p>
<p>Is partly to behold my lady’s face,</p>
<p>But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger</p>
<p>A precious ring, a ring that I must use</p>
<p>In dear employment 1265 : therefore hence, begone.</p>
<p>But if thou, jealous 1266 , dost return to pry</p>
<p>In what I further shall intend to do,</p>
<p>By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint</p>
<p>And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:</p>
<p>The time and my intents are savage-wild,</p>
<p>More fierce and more inexorable far</p>
<p>Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.</p>
<p>BALTHASAR I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.</p>
<p>ROMEO So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>Live and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.</p>
<p>BALTHASAR For all this same 1267 , I’ll hide me hereabout:</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt 1268 .</p>
<p>Stands aside</p>
<p>ROMEO Thou detestable maw 1269 , thou womb 1270 of death,</p>
<p>Romeo begins to open the tomb</p>
<p>Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth:</p>
<p>Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,</p>
<p>And in despite 1271 I’ll cram thee with more food.</p>
<p>PARIS This is that banished haughty Montague,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>That murdered my love’s cousin, with which grief</p>
<p>It is supposèd the fair creature died,</p>
<p>And here is come to do some villainous shame</p>
<p>To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.—</p>
<p>Stop thy unhallowed 1272 toil, vile Montague!</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>Can vengeance be pursued further than death?</p>
<p>Condemnèd villain, I do apprehend thee:</p>
<p>Obey and go with me, for thou must die.</p>
<p>ROMEO I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.</p>
<p>Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp’rate man,</p>
<p>Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone 1273 ,</p>
<p>Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,</p>
<p>Put not another sin upon my head,</p>
<p>By urging me to fury: O, begone!</p>
<p>By heaven, I love thee better than myself,</p>
<p>For I come hither armed against myself.</p>
<p>Stay not, begone, live, and hereafter say,</p>
<p>A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.</p>
<p>PARIS I do defy thy commiseration 1274 ,</p>
<p>And apprehend thee for a felon here.</p>
<p>ROMEO Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!</p>
<p>They fight</p>
<p>PAGE O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>PARIS O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,</p>
<p>Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.</p>
<p>Dies</p>
<p>ROMEO In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.</p>
<p>Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!</p>
<p>What said my man, when my betossèd soul</p>
<p>Did not attend him as we rode? I think</p>
<p>He told me Paris should have 1275 married Juliet:</p>
<p>Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?</p>
<p>Or am I mad, hearing him 1276 talk of Juliet,</p>
<p>To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,</p>
<p>One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book!</p>
<p>I’ll bury thee in a triumphant 1277 grave.</p>
<p>Opens the tomb, revealing Juliet</p>
<p>A grave? O no, a lantern 1278 , slaughtered youth,</p>
<p>For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes</p>
<p>This vault a feasting presence 1279 full of light.</p>
<p>Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interred.</p>
<p>How oft when men are at the point of death</p>
<p>Have they been merry, which their keepers 1280 call</p>
<p>A light’ning before death. O, how may I</p>
<p>Call this a light’ning? O my love, my wife!</p>
<p>Death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,</p>
<p>Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:</p>
<p>Thou art not conquered, beauty’s ensign 1281 yet</p>
<p>Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,</p>
<p>And death’s pale flag is not advancèd 1282 there.—</p>
<p>Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?</p>
<p>O, what more favour can I do to thee</p>
<p>Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain</p>
<p>To sunder his that was thy enemy 1283 ?</p>
<p>Forgive me, cousin.— Ah, dear Juliet,</p>
<p>Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe</p>
<p>That unsubstantial 1284 death is amorous,</p>
<p>And that the lean abhorrèd monster keeps</p>
<p>Thee here in dark to be his paramour?</p>
<p>For fear of that, I still 1285 will stay with thee,</p>
<p>And never from this palace of dim night</p>
<p>// Depart again. Come lie thou in my arms. //</p>
<p>// Here’s to thy health, where’er thou tumblest in. //</p>
<p>// O true 1286 apothecary, //</p>
<p>// Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. //</p>
<p>Depart again. Here, here will I remain</p>
<p>With worms that are thy chambermaids: O, here</p>
<p>Will I set up my everlasting rest,</p>
<p>And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars</p>
<p>From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!</p>
<p>Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you</p>
<p>The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss</p>
<p>A dateless bargain 1287 to engrossing 1288 death!</p>
<p>Kisses Juliet</p>
<p>Come, bitter conduct 1289 , come, unsavoury guide!</p>
<p>Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on</p>
<p>The dashing 1290 rocks thy seasick weary bark!</p>
<p>Here’s to my love. O true apothecary,</p>
<p>Drinks</p>
<p>Thy drugs are quick 1291 . Thus with a kiss I die.</p>
<p>Dies</p>
<p>Enter Friar Laurence with lantern, crow and spade</p>
<p>FRIAR LAURENCE Saint Francis be my speed 1292 ! How oft tonight</p>
<p>Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who’s there?</p>
<p>BALTHASAR Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.</p>
<p>FRIAR LAURENCE Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,</p>
<p>What torch is yon that vainly 1293 lends his light</p>
<p>To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,</p>
<p>It burneth in the Capels’ monument.</p>
<p>BALTHASAR It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,</p>
<p>One that you love.</p>
<p>FRIAR LAURENCE Who is it?</p>
<p>BALTHASAR Romeo.</p>
<p>FRIAR LAURENCE How long hath he been there?</p>
<p>BALTHASAR Full half an hour.</p>
<p>FRIAR LAURENCE Go with me to the vault.</p>
<p>BALTHASAR I dare not, sir.</p>
<p>My master knows not but I am gone hence,</p>
<p>And fearfully did menace me with death</p>
<p>If I did stay to look on his intents.</p>
<p>FRIAR LAURENCE Stay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me:</p>
<p>O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.</p>
<p>BALTHASAR As I did sleep under this yew tree here,</p>
<p>I dreamt my master and another fought,</p>
<p>And that my master slew him.</p>
<p>FRIAR LAURENCE Romeo!</p>
<p>Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains</p>
<p>The stony entrance of this sepulchre?</p>
<p>What mean these masterless and gory swords</p>
<p>To lie discoloured by this place of peace?</p>
<p>Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?</p>
<p>And steeped in blood? Ah, what an unkind 1294 hour</p>
<p>Is guilty of this lamentable chance!</p>
<p>The lady stirs.</p>
<p>JULIET O, comfortable 1295 friar, where’s my lord?</p>
<p>Waking</p>
<p>I do remember well where I should be,</p>
<p>And there I am. Where is my Romeo?</p>
<p>FRIAR LAURENCE I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest Of death,
contagion and unnatural sleep:</p>
<p>A greater power than we can contradict</p>
<p>Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.</p>
<p>Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead,</p>
<p>And Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee</p>
<p>Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.</p>
<p>Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.</p>
<p>Come, go, good Juliet, I dare no longer stay.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>JULIET Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.</p>
<p>What’s here? A cup closed in my true love’s hand?</p>
<p>Poison I see hath been his timeless 1296 end.</p>
<p>O churl 1297 , drink all and left no friendly drop</p>
<p>To help me after? I will kiss thy lips,</p>
<p>Haply 1298 some poison yet doth hang on them,</p>
<p>To make me die with a restorative.</p>
<p>Kisses him</p>
<p>Thy lips are warm.</p>
<p>Enter Boy and Watch [Constable and other Watchmen ]</p>
<p>At a distance</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Lead, boy, which way?</p>
<p>JULIET Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy 1299 dagger,</p>
<p>This is thy sheath: there rust, and let me die.</p>
<p>Kills herself</p>
<p>PAGE This is the place, there where the torch doth burn.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE The ground is bloody, search about the churchyard:</p>
<p>Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach 1300 .</p>
<p>[Exeunt some Watchmen ]</p>
<p>Pitiful sight! Here lies the county slain,</p>
<p>And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,</p>
<p>Who here hath lain these two days burièd.</p>
<p>Go, tell the prince, run to the Capulets,</p>
<p>Raise up the Montagues, some others search.</p>
<p>[Exeunt other Watchmen ]</p>
<p>We see the ground 1301 whereon these woes do lie,</p>
<p>But the true ground of all these piteous woes</p>
<p>We cannot without circumstance 1302 descry.</p>
<p>Enter Romeo’s man [Balthasar with Watchman ]</p>
<p>SECOND WATCHMAN Here’s Romeo’s man: we found him in the
churchyard.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.</p>
<p>Enter Friar and another Watchman</p>
<p>THIRD WATCHMAN Here is a friar that trembles, sighs and weeps:</p>
<p>We took this mattock and this spade from him,</p>
<p>As he was coming from this churchyard side.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE A great suspicion: stay 1303 the friar too.</p>
<p>Enter the Prince [and Attendants ]</p>
<p>PRINCE What misadventure is so early up,</p>
<p>That calls our person from our morning rest?</p>
<p>Enter Capulet and his Wife [and others ]</p>
<p>CAPULET What should it be that they so shriek abroad?</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET O, the people in the street cry ‘Romeo’,</p>
<p>Some ‘Juliet’, and some ‘Paris’, and all run</p>
<p>With open outcry toward our monument.</p>
<p>PRINCE What fear is this which startles in your ears?</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,</p>
<p>And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,</p>
<p>Warm and new killed.</p>
<p>PRINCE Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Here is a friar, and slaughtered Romeo’s man,</p>
<p>With instruments upon them, fit to open</p>
<p>These dead men’s tombs.</p>
<p>CAPULET O heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!</p>
<p>This dagger hath mista’en 1304 — for lo his house</p>
<p>Is empty on the back of Montague —</p>
<p>And is mis-sheathèd in my daughter’s bosom!</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET O me, this sight of death is as a bell</p>
<p>That warns 1305 my old age to a sepulchre 1306 .</p>
<p>Enter Montague</p>
<p>PRINCE Come, Montague, for thou art early up</p>
<p>To see thy son and heir now early down.</p>
<p>MONTAGUE Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight 1307 :</p>
<p>Grief of my son’s exile hath stopped her breath.</p>
<p>What further woe conspires against my age?</p>
<p>PRINCE Look and thou shalt see.</p>
<p>MONTAGUE O, thou untaught 1308 , what manners is in this?</p>
<p>To press before thy father to a grave?</p>
<p>PRINCE Seal up the mouth of outrage 1309 for awhile,</p>
<p>Till we can clear these ambiguities,</p>
<p>↓The tomb may be closed↓</p>
<p>And know their spring, their head 1310 , their true descent,</p>
<p>And then will I be general 1311 of your woes,</p>
<p>And lead you even to death 1312 . Meantime forbear,</p>
<p>And let mischance be slave to 1313 patience.—</p>
<p>Bring forth the parties of suspicion.</p>
<p>FRIAR LAURENCE I am the greatest, able to do least,</p>
<p>Yet most suspected, as the time and place</p>
<p>Doth make against 1314 me of this direful murder:</p>
<p>And here I stand both to impeach and purge</p>
<p>Myself condemnèd and myself excused 1315 .</p>
<p>PRINCE Then say at once what thou dost know in this.</p>
<p>FRIAR LAURENCE I will be brief, for my short date of breath 1316</p>
<p>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</p>
<p>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,</p>
<p>And she, there dead, that’s Romeo’s faithful wife:</p>
<p>I married them and their stol’n marriage day</p>
<p>Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death</p>
<p>Banished the new-made bridegroom from this city,</p>
<p>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</p>
<p>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</p>
<p>Betrothed and would have married her perforce 1317</p>
<p>To County Paris. Then comes she to me,</p>
<p>And with wild looks bid me devise some means</p>
<p>To rid her from this second marriage,</p>
<p>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</p>
<p>Then gave I her — so tutored by my art 1318 —</p>
<p>A sleeping potion, which so took effect</p>
<p>As I intended, for it wrought 1319 on her</p>
<p>The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo</p>
<p>That he should hither come as 1320 this dire night</p>
<p>To help to take her from her borrowed grave,</p>
<p>Being the time the potion’s force should cease.</p>
<p>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</p>
<p>Was stayed 1321 by accident, and yesternight</p>
<p>Returned my letter back. Then all alone,</p>
<p>At the prefixèd hour of her waking,</p>
<p>Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,</p>
<p>Meaning to keep her closely 1322 at my cell,</p>
<p>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.</p>
<p>But when I came — some minute ere the time</p>
<p>Of her awaking — here untimely lay</p>
<p>The noble Paris and true 1323 Romeo dead.</p>
<p>She wakes, and I entreated her come forth,</p>
<p>And bear this work of heaven with patience:</p>
<p>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,</p>
<p>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</p>
<p>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</p>
<p>All this I know, and to the marriage</p>
<p>Her nurse is privy 1324 : and if aught 1325 in this</p>
<p>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</p>
<p>Be sacrificed, some hour before the time 1326 ,</p>
<p>Unto the rigour of severest law.</p>
<p>PRINCE We still 1327 have known thee for a holy man.—</p>
<p>Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?</p>
<p>BALTHASAR I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,</p>
<p>And then in post 1328 he came from Mantua</p>
<p>To this same place, to this same monument.</p>
<p>This letter he early bid me give his father,</p>
<p>Shows letter</p>
<p>And threatened me with death, going in the vault,</p>
<p>If I departed not and left him there.</p>
<p>PRINCE Give me the letter, I will look on it.</p>
<p>Where is the county’s page, that raised the watch?—</p>
<p>Sirrah, what made 1329 your master in this place?</p>
<p>PAGE He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,</p>
<p>And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:</p>
<p>Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,</p>
<p>And by and by 1330 my master drew on him,</p>
<p>And then I ran away to call the watch.</p>
<p>PRINCE This letter doth make good 1331 the friar’s words,</p>
<p>Their course of love, the tidings of her death:</p>
<p>And here he writes that he did buy a poison</p>
<p>Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal 1332</p>
<p>Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.</p>
<p>Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague?</p>
<p>See, what a scourge 1333 is laid upon your hate,</p>
<p>That heaven finds means to kill your joys 1334 with love.</p>
<p>And I for winking at 1335 your discords too</p>
<p>Have lost a brace 1336 of kinsmen: all are punished.</p>
<p>CAPULET O brother Montague, give me thy hand:</p>
<p>This is my daughter’s jointure 1337 , for no more</p>
<p>Can I demand.</p>
<p>MONTAGUE But I can give thee more,</p>
<p>For I will raise 1338 her statue 1339 in pure gold,</p>
<p>That whiles Verona by that name is known,</p>
<p>There shall no figure 1340 at such rate be set 1341</p>
<p>As that of true and faithful Juliet.</p>
<p>CAPULET As rich shall Romeo 1342 by his lady lie,</p>
<p>Poor sacrifices of 1343 our enmity!</p>
<p>PRINCE A glooming 1344 peace this morning with it brings,</p>
<p>The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head.</p>
<p>Go hence to have more talk of these sad things:</p>
<p>Some shall be pardoned, and some punishèd,</p>
<p>For never was a story of more woe</p>
<p>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster , and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘［and Attendants ］’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading ‘bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
