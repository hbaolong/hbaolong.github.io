10</h4>
<p>Enter Buckingham, Derby, Hastings, Bishop of Ely, Norfolk, Ratcliffe,
Lovell, with others. [They take their seats ] at a table</p>
<p>HASTINGS Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met</p>
<p>Is to determine of 943 the coronation.</p>
<p>In God’s name speak: when is the royal day?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Is all things ready for the royal time?</p>
<p>DERBY It is, and wants but nomination 944 .</p>
<p>BISHOP OF ELY Tomorrow, then, I judge a happy 945 day.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Who knows the Lord Protector’s mind herein?</p>
<p>Who is most inward 946 with the noble duke?</p>
<p>BISHOP OF ELY Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind 947
.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM We know each other’s faces: for 948 our hearts,</p>
<p>He knows no more of mine, than I of yours,</p>
<p>Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.—</p>
<p>Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love 949 .</p>
<p>HASTINGS I thank his grace, I know he loves me well.</p>
<p>But, for his purpose in the coronation,</p>
<p>I have not sounded 950 him, nor he delivered</p>
<p>His gracious pleasure any way therein:</p>
<p>But you, my honourable lords, may name the time,</p>
<p>And in 951 the duke’s behalf I’ll give my voice 952 ,</p>
<p>Which I presume he’ll take in gentle part 953 .</p>
<p>Enter [Richard of ] Gloucester</p>
<p>BISHOP OF ELY In happy time, here comes the duke himself.</p>
<p>RICHARD My noble lords and cousins 954 all, good morrow.</p>
<p>I have been long a sleeper: but I trust</p>
<p>My absence doth neglect 955 no great design</p>
<p>Which by my presence might have been concluded.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,</p>
<p>William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part 956 —</p>
<p>I mean your voice — for crowning of the king.</p>
<p>RICHARD Than my lord Hastings no man might be bolder 957 :</p>
<p>His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.—</p>
<p>My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn,</p>
<p>I saw good strawberries in your garden there:</p>
<p>I do beseech you send for some of them.</p>
<p>BISHOP OF ELY Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.</p>
<p>Exit Bishop</p>
<p>RICHARD Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.</p>
<p>Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,</p>
<p>They speak aside</p>
<p>And finds the testy 958 gentleman so hot 959</p>
<p>That he will lose his head 960 ere give consent</p>
<p>His master’s child, as worshipfully 961 he terms it,</p>
<p>Shall lose the royalty of England’s throne.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Withdraw yourself a while. I’ll go with you.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Richard and Buckingham ]</p>
<p>DERBY We have not yet set down 962 this day of triumph.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, in my judgement, is too sudden,</p>
<p>For I myself am not so well provided 963</p>
<p>As else I would be, were the day prolonged 964 .</p>
<p>Enter the Bishop of Ely</p>
<p>BISHOP OF ELY Where is my lord, the Duke of Gloucester?</p>
<p>I have sent for these strawberries.</p>
<p>HASTINGS His grace looks cheerfully and smooth 965 this morning:</p>
<p>There’s some conceit 966 or other likes 967 him well,</p>
<p>When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.</p>
<p>I think there’s never a man in Christendom</p>
<p>Can lesser hide his love or hate than he,</p>
<p>For by his face straight 968 shall you know his heart.</p>
<p>DERBY What of his heart perceive you in his face</p>
<p>By any livelihood 969 he showed today?</p>
<p>HASTINGS Marry, that with no man here he is offended:</p>
<p>For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.</p>
<p>Enter Richard and Buckingham</p>
<p>RICHARD I pray you all, tell me what they deserve</p>
<p>That do conspire my death with devilish plots</p>
<p>Of damnèd witchcraft, and that have prevailed</p>
<p>Upon my body with their hellish charms 970 .</p>
<p>HASTINGS The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,</p>
<p>Makes me most forward in this princely presence</p>
<p>To doom 971 th’offenders, whosoe’er they be:</p>
<p>I say, my lord, they have deservèd death.</p>
<p>RICHARD Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.</p>
<p>Look how I am bewitched: behold, mine arm</p>
<p>Points to his arm</p>
<p>Is like a blasted 972 sapling, withered up:</p>
<p>And this is 973 Edward’s wife, that monstrous 974 witch,</p>
<p>Consorted 975 with that harlot, strumpet Shore 976 ,</p>
<p>That by their witchcraft thus have markèd me.</p>
<p>HASTINGS If they have done this deed, my noble lord—</p>
<p>RICHARD If? Thou protector of this damnèd strumpet—</p>
<p>Talk’st thou to me of ‘ifs’? Thou art a traitor.</p>
<p>Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,</p>
<p>I will not dine until I see the same 977 . —</p>
<p>Lovell and Ratcliffe, look that it be done.</p>
<p>The rest that love me, rise and follow me.</p>
<p>Exeunt. Lovell and Ratcliffe with the Lord Hastings remain</p>
<p>HASTINGS Woe, woe for England! Not a whit for me,</p>
<p>For I, too fond 978 , might have prevented this.</p>
<p>Stanley did dream the boar did rouse 979 our helms;</p>
<p>And I did scorn it and disdain to fly.</p>
<p>Three times today my foot-cloth horse 980 did stumble,</p>
<p>And started 981 , when he looked upon the Tower,</p>
<p>As 982 loath 983 to bear me to the slaughter-house.</p>
<p>O, now I need the priest that spake to me:</p>
<p>I now repent I told the pursuivant,</p>
<p>As too triumphing 984 how mine enemies</p>
<p>Today at Pomfret bloodily were butchered,</p>
<p>And I myself secure in grace and favour.</p>
<p>O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse</p>
<p>Is lighted on poor Hastings’ wretched head!</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Come, come, dispatch. The duke would be at dinner.</p>
<p>Make a short shrift 985 : he longs to see your head.</p>
<p>HASTINGS O, momentary grace 986 of mortal men,</p>
<p>Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!</p>
<p>Who 987 builds his hope in air 988 of your good 989 looks,</p>
<p>Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,</p>
<p>Ready with every nod to tumble down</p>
<p>Into the fatal bowels of the deep.</p>
<p>LOVELL Come, come, dispatch: ’tis bootless 990 to exclaim 991 .</p>
<p>HASTINGS O bloody Richard! Miserable England!</p>
<p>I prophesy the fearful’st time to thee</p>
<p>That ever wretched age hath looked upon.</p>
<p>Come, lead me to the block: bear him my head.</p>
<p>They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
