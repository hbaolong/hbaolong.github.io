<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-4-226">Scene 1 ／ running scene 4 226</h4>
<p>Enter Valentine [and ] Speed</p>
<p>SPEED Sir, your glove.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Not mine: my gloves are on 227 .</p>
<p>SPEED Why then, this may be yours, for this is but one.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Ha! Let me see: ay, give it me, it’s mine.</p>
<p>Sweet ornament 228 that decks 229 a thing divine.</p>
<p>Ah, Silvia 230 , Silvia!</p>
<p>SPEED Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!</p>
<p>Calls</p>
<p>VALENTINE How now, sirrah 231 ?</p>
<p>SPEED She is not within hearing, sir.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Why, sir, who bade you call her?</p>
<p>SPEED Your worship, sir, or else I mistook.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Well, you’ll still 232 be too forward 233 .</p>
<p>SPEED And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Go to 234 , sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?</p>
<p>SPEED She that your worship loves?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Why, how know you that I am in love?</p>
<p>SPEED Marry, by these special marks 235 : first, you have
learned—like Sir Proteus—to wreathe 236 your arms like a malcontent 237
: to relish 238 a love-song like a robin-redbreast: to walk alone like
one that had the pestilence 239 : to sigh like a school-boy that had
lost his A B C 240 : to weep like a young wench that had buried her
grandam 241 : to fast like one that takes diet: to watch 242 like one
that fears robbing: to speak puling 243 like a beggar at Hallowmas 244 .
You were wont 245 , when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you
walked, to walk like one of the lions: when you fasted, it was presently
246 after dinner: when you looked sadly, it was for want 247 of money.
And now you are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look on you,
I can hardly think you my master.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Are all these things perceived in me?</p>
<p>SPEED They are all perceived without ye 248 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE Without me 249 ? They cannot.</p>
<p>SPEED Without you 250 ? Nay, that’s certain: for, without 251 you
were so simple, none else would. But you are so without these follies,
that these follies are within you, and shine through you like the water
in an urinal 252 , that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to
comment on your malady 253 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?</p>
<p>SPEED She that you gaze on so, as she sits at supper?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Hast thou observed that? Even she 254 , I mean.</p>
<p>SPEED Why sir, I know her not.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet know’st her
not?</p>
<p>SPEED Is she not hard-favoured 255 , sir?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured 256 of you,
well-favoured 257 .</p>
<p>SPEED Sir, I know that well enough.</p>
<p>VALENTINE What dost thou know?</p>
<p>SPEED That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.</p>
<p>VALENTINE I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour 258
infinite.</p>
<p>SPEED That’s because the one is painted 259 and the other out of all
count 260 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE How painted? And how out of count?</p>
<p>SPEED Marry, sir, so painted to make her fair, that no man counts of
261 her beauty.</p>
<p>VALENTINE How esteem’st thou me? 262 I account of her beauty.</p>
<p>SPEED You never saw her since she was deformed 263 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE How long hath she been deformed?</p>
<p>SPEED Ever since you loved her.</p>
<p>VALENTINE I have loved her ever since I saw her, and still I see her
beautiful.</p>
<p>SPEED If you love her, you cannot see her.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Why?</p>
<p>SPEED Because Love is blind 264 . O, that you had mine eyes, or your
own eyes had the lights 265 they were wont to have when you chid at Sir
Proteus for going ungartered 266 !</p>
<p>VALENTINE What should I see then?</p>
<p>SPEED Your own present folly and her passing deformity: for he, being
in love, could not see to garter his hose 267 ; and you, being in love,
cannot see to put on your hose.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Belike, boy, then you are in love, for last morning you
could not see to wipe my shoes.</p>
<p>SPEED True, sir: I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you swinged
268 me for my love, which makes me the bolder to chide you for
yours.</p>
<p>VALENTINE In conclusion, I stand affected to 269 her.</p>
<p>SPEED I would you were set 270 , so your affection would cease.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she
loves.</p>
<p>SPEED And have you?</p>
<p>VALENTINE I have.</p>
<p>SPEED Are they not lamely writ?</p>
<p>VALENTINE No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace! Here she
comes.</p>
<p>SPEED O, excellent motion 271 ! O, exceeding puppet! Now will he
interpret to her 272 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>[Enter Silvia ]</p>
<p>VALENTINE Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.</p>
<p>SPEED O, ’give ye good ev’n 273 : here’s a million of 274
manners.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>SILVIA Sir Valentine and servant 275 , to you two thousand.</p>
<p>SPEED He should give her interest, and she gives it him 276 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>VALENTINE As you enjoined me, I have writ your letter</p>
<p>Unto the secret, nameless friend 277 of yours,</p>
<p>Which I was much unwilling to proceed in</p>
<p>But for my duty to your ladyship.</p>
<p>Gives her a letter</p>
<p>SILVIA I thank you, gentle servant: ’tis very clerkly 278 done.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off 279 :</p>
<p>For being ignorant to whom it goes</p>
<p>I writ at random, very doubtfully 280 .</p>
<p>SILVIA Perchance you think too much of so much pains 281 ?</p>
<p>VALENTINE No, madam, so it stead you 282 , I will write —</p>
<p>Please you command — a thousand times as much.</p>
<p>And yet—</p>
<p>SILVIA A pretty period 283 ! Well, I guess the sequel 284 ,</p>
<p>And yet I will not name it: and yet I care not.</p>
<p>And yet take this 285 again. And yet I thank you,</p>
<p>Offers him the letter</p>
<p>Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.</p>
<p>SPEED And yet you will, and yet another ‘yet’.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>VALENTINE What means your ladyship? Do you not like it?</p>
<p>SILVIA Yes, yes: the lines are very quaintly 286 writ,</p>
<p>But, since unwillingly, take them again 287 .</p>
<p>Offers the letter again</p>
<p>Nay, take them.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Madam, they are for you.</p>
<p>SILVIA Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request,</p>
<p>But I will none of 288 them. They are for you:</p>
<p>I would have had them writ more movingly.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Please you, I’ll write your ladyship another.</p>
<p>SILVIA And when it’s writ, for my sake read it over,</p>
<p>And if it please you, so 289 : if not, why, so.</p>
<p>VALENTINE If it please me, madam? What then?</p>
<p>SILVIA Why, if it please you, take it for your labour 290 ;</p>
<p>And so, good morrow, servant.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>SPEED O, jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>As a nose on a man’s face, or a weathercock on a steeple!</p>
<p>My master sues to 291 her, and she hath taught her suitor,</p>
<p>He being her pupil, to become her tutor.</p>
<p>O, excellent device 292 ! Was there ever heard a better?</p>
<p>That my master, being scribe,</p>
<p>To himself should write the letter?</p>
<p>VALENTINE How now, sir? What, are you reasoning 293 with
yourself?</p>
<p>SPEED Nay, I was rhyming: ’tis you that have the reason.</p>
<p>VALENTINE To do what?</p>
<p>SPEED To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia.</p>
<p>VALENTINE To whom?</p>
<p>SPEED To yourself: why, she woos you by a figure 294 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE What figure?</p>
<p>SPEED By a letter, I should say.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Why, she hath not writ to me?</p>
<p>SPEED What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself? Why,
do you not perceive the jest?</p>
<p>VALENTINE No, believe me.</p>
<p>SPEED No believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive her earnest
295 ?</p>
<p>VALENTINE She gave me none 296 , except an angry word.</p>
<p>SPEED Why, she hath given you a letter.</p>
<p>VALENTINE That’s the letter I writ to her friend.</p>
<p>SPEED And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end 297 .</p>
<p>VALENTINE I would it were no worse.</p>
<p>SPEED I’ll warrant 298 you, ’tis as well:</p>
<p>For often have you writ to her, and she in modesty,</p>
<p>Or else for want 299 of idle time, could not again reply,</p>
<p>Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover 300 ,</p>
<p>Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.</p>
<p>All this I speak in print 301 , for in print I found it.</p>
<p>Why muse you, sir? ’Tis dinner-time.</p>
<p>VALENTINE I have dined 302 .</p>
<p>SPEED Ay, but hearken, sir: though the chameleon Love can feed on the
air 303 , I am one that am nourished by my victuals 304 , and would fain
305 have meat. O, be not like your mistress: be moved 306 , be
moved.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
