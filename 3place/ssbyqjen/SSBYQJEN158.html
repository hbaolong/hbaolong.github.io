continues</h4>
<p>Enter Queen of Fairies [Titania ] and Clown [Bottom, with ass head,
wearing a coronet of flowers ] and Fairies [Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth,
Mustardseed ] and the King [Oberon ] behind them</p>
<p>TITANIA Come, sit thee down upon this flow’ry bed,</p>
<p>While I thy amiable 753 cheeks do coy 754 ,</p>
<p>And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,</p>
<p>And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.</p>
<p>↓ She fondles him ↓</p>
<p>BOTTOM Where’s Peaseblossom?</p>
<p>PEASEBLOSSOM Ready.</p>
<p>BOTTOM Scratch my head, Peaseblossom. Where’s Monsieur Cobweb?</p>
<p>COBWEB Ready.</p>
<p>BOTTOM Monsieur Cobweb, good monsieur, get you your weapons in your
hand, and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and,
good monsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret yourself too much in
the action, monsieur; and, good monsieur, have a care the honey-bag
break not. I would be loath to have you overflown 755 with a honey-bag,
signior. Where’s Monsieur Mustardseed?</p>
<p>Cobweb may exit</p>
<p>MUSTARDSEED Ready.</p>
<p>BOTTOM Give me your neaf 756 , Monsieur Mustardseed. Pray you leave
your courtesy 757 , good monsieur.</p>
<p>MUSTARDSEED What’s your will?</p>
<p>BOTTOM Nothing, good monsieur, but to help Cavalery 758 Cobweb 759 to
scratch. I must to the barber’s, monsieur, for methinks I am marvellous
760 hairy about the face. And I am such a tender ass, if my hair do but
tickle me, I must scratch.</p>
<p>TITANIA What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?</p>
<p>BOTTOM I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let us have the tongs
761 and the bones.</p>
<p>Music: tongs, rural music 762</p>
<p>TITANIA Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.</p>
<p>BOTTOM Truly, a peck 763 of provender 764 ; I could munch your good
dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle 765 of hay: good
hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow 766 .</p>
<p>TITANIA I have a vent’rous 767 fairy that shall seek</p>
<p>The squirrel’s hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.</p>
<p>BOTTOM I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But, I pray
you let none of your people stir 768 me. I have an exposition of 769
sleep come upon me.</p>
<p>TITANIA Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.</p>
<p>Fairies, begone, and be all ways away 770 .</p>
<p>[Exeunt fairies ]</p>
<p>So doth the woodbine 771 the sweet honeysuckle</p>
<p>Gently entwist; the female ivy so</p>
<p>Enrings 772 the barky fingers of the elm.</p>
<p>O, how I love thee! How I dote on thee!</p>
<p>They sleep</p>
<p>Enter Robin Goodfellow and Oberon [who comes forward ]</p>
<p>OBERON Welcome, good Robin.</p>
<p>See’st thou this sweet sight?</p>
<p>Her dotage 773 now I do begin to pity.</p>
<p>For, meeting her of late behind the wood,</p>
<p>Seeking sweet favours 774 for this hateful fool,</p>
<p>I did upbraid her and fall out with her.</p>
<p>For she his hairy temples then had rounded</p>
<p>With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>And that same dew, which sometime 775 on the buds</p>
<p>Was wont to swell like round and orient 776 pearls,</p>
<p>Stood now within the pretty flowerets 777 ’ eyes</p>
<p>Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.</p>
<p>When I had at my pleasure taunted her,</p>
<p>And she in mild terms begged my patience,</p>
<p>I then did ask of her her changeling child,</p>
<p>Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent</p>
<p>To bear him to my bower in fairy land.</p>
<p>And now I have the boy, I will undo</p>
<p>This hateful imperfection of her eyes.</p>
<p>And, gentle Puck, take this transformèd scalp</p>
<p>From off the head of this Athenian swain 778 ;</p>
<p>That, he awaking when the other 779 do,</p>
<p>May all to Athens back again repair 780 ,</p>
<p>And think no more of this night’s accidents 781</p>
<p>But as the fierce vexation of a dream.</p>
<p>But first I will release the fairy queen.</p>
<p>Be thou as thou wast wont to be;</p>
<p>Squeezes the herb on her eyes</p>
<p>See as thou wast wont to see.</p>
<p>Dian’s bud 782 o’er Cupid’s flower</p>
<p>Hath such force and blessèd power.</p>
<p>Now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.</p>
<p>TITANIA My Oberon! What visions have I seen!</p>
<p>Methought I was enamoured of an ass.</p>
<p>OBERON There lies your love.</p>
<p>TITANIA How came these things to pass?</p>
<p>O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!</p>
<p>OBERON Silence awhile.— Robin, take off this head.—</p>
<p>Titania, music call, and strike more dead</p>
<p>Than common sleep of all these five 783 the sense.</p>
<p>TITANIA Music, ho! Music, such as charmeth 784 sleep!</p>
<p>Music, still 785</p>
<p>ROBIN Now, when thou wak’st, with thine own fool’s eyes peep.</p>
<p>OBERON Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,</p>
<p>And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.</p>
<p>Now thou and I are new in amity,</p>
<p>And will tomorrow midnight solemnly 786</p>
<p>Dance in Duke Theseus’ house triumphantly 787 ,</p>
<p>And bless it to all fair prosperity.</p>
<p>There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be</p>
<p>Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.</p>
<p>ROBIN Fairy king, attend 788 , and mark:</p>
<p>I do hear the morning lark.</p>
<p>OBERON Then, my queen, in silence sad 789 ,</p>
<p>Trip 790 we after the night’s shade;</p>
<p>We the globe can compass soon,</p>
<p>Swifter than the wand’ring moon.</p>
<p>TITANIA Come, my lord, and in our flight</p>
<p>Tell me how it came this night</p>
<p>That I sleeping here was found</p>
<p>With these mortals on the ground.</p>
<p>Exeunt. Sleepers lie still</p>
<p>Wind horns. Enter Theseus, Egeus, Hippolyta, and all his 791
train</p>
<p>THESEUS Go, one of you, find out the forester,</p>
<p>For now our observation 792 is performed;</p>
<p>And since we have the vaward 793 of the day,</p>
<p>My love shall hear the music of my hounds.</p>
<p>Uncouple 794 in the western valley, let them go;</p>
<p>Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.</p>
<p>[Exit an Attendant ]</p>
<p>We will, fair queen, up to the mountain’s top</p>
<p>And mark the musical confusion</p>
<p>Of hounds and echo in conjunction.</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA I was with Hercules and Cadmus 795 once,</p>
<p>When in a wood of Crete they bayed 796 the bear</p>
<p>With hounds of Sparta 797 ; never did I hear</p>
<p>Such gallant chiding 798 , for besides the groves,</p>
<p>The skies, the fountains, every region near</p>
<p>Seemed all one mutual cry. I never heard</p>
<p>So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.</p>
<p>THESEUS My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind 799 ,</p>
<p>So flewed 800 , so sanded 801 , and their heads are hung</p>
<p>With ears that sweep away the morning dew,</p>
<p>Crook-kneed and dewlapped 802 like Thessalian 803 bulls,</p>
<p>Slow in pursuit, but matched in mouth 804 like bells,</p>
<p>Each under each. A cry more tuneable 805</p>
<p>Was never hallowed to 806 , nor cheered 807 with horn,</p>
<p>In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly;</p>
<p>Judge when you hear. But, soft 808 ! What nymphs are these?</p>
<p>EGEUS My lord, this is my daughter here asleep,</p>
<p>And this, Lysander, this Demetrius is,</p>
<p>This Helena, old Nedar’s Helena.</p>
<p>I wonder of 809 their being here together.</p>
<p>THESEUS No doubt they rose up early to observe</p>
<p>The rite of May, and hearing our intent,</p>
<p>Came here in grace of 810 our solemnity 811 .</p>
<p>But speak, Egeus; is not this the day</p>
<p>That Hermia should give answer of her choice?</p>
<p>EGEUS It is, my lord.</p>
<p>THESEUS Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.</p>
<p>Horns and they wake. Shout within, they all start up.</p>
<p>Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine 812 is past.</p>
<p>Begin these woodbirds but to couple 813 now?</p>
<p>LYSANDER Pardon, my lord.</p>
<p>They kneel</p>
<p>THESEUS I pray you all stand up.</p>
<p>They stand</p>
<p>I know you two are rival enemies.</p>
<p>How comes this gentle concord in the world,</p>
<p>That hatred is so far from jealousy 814 ,</p>
<p>To sleep by hate and fear no enmity?</p>
<p>LYSANDER My lord, I shall reply amazedly,</p>
<p>Half sleep, half waking. But as yet, I swear,</p>
<p>I cannot truly say how I came here.</p>
<p>But, as I think — for truly would I speak,</p>
<p>And now I do bethink me, so it is —</p>
<p>I came with Hermia hither. Our intent</p>
<p>Was to be gone from Athens, where we might be</p>
<p>Without the peril of the Athenian law.</p>
<p>EGEUS Enough, enough, my lord. You have enough;</p>
<p>I beg the law, the law, upon his head.—</p>
<p>They would have stolen away, they would, Demetrius,</p>
<p>Thereby to have defeated 815 you and me:</p>
<p>You of your wife and me of my consent,</p>
<p>Of my consent that she should be your wife.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,</p>
<p>Of this their purpose hither to this wood,</p>
<p>And I in fury hither followed them;</p>
<p>Fair Helena in fancy 816 followed me.</p>
<p>But, my good lord, I wot not by what power —</p>
<p>But by some power it is — my love to Hermia,</p>
<p>Melted as the snow, seems to me now</p>
<p>As the remembrance of an idle gaud 817</p>
<p>Which in my childhood I did dote upon.</p>
<p>And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,</p>
<p>The object and the pleasure of mine eye,</p>
<p>Is only Helena. To her, my lord,</p>
<p>Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia:</p>
<p>But like a sickness did I loathe this food.</p>
<p>But, as in health, come to my natural taste,</p>
<p>Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,</p>
<p>And will for evermore be true to it.</p>
<p>THESEUS Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:</p>
<p>Of this discourse we shall hear more anon.</p>
<p>Egeus, I will overbear 818 your will;</p>
<p>For in the temple, by and by 819 with us,</p>
<p>These couples shall eternally be knit.</p>
<p>And, for 820 the morning now is something worn 821 ,</p>
<p>Our purposed 822 hunting shall be set aside.</p>
<p>Away with us to Athens; three and three,</p>
<p>We’ll hold a feast in 823 great solemnity 824 .—</p>
<p>Come, Hippolyta.</p>
<p>Exeunt Duke and lords [and Hippolyta ]</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS These things seem small and undistinguishable 825 ,</p>
<p>Like far-off mountains turnèd into clouds.</p>
<p>HERMIA Methinks I see these things with parted 826 eye,</p>
<p>When everything seems double.</p>
<p>HELENA So methinks:</p>
<p>And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,</p>
<p>Mine own 827 and not mine own.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS It seems to me</p>
<p>That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think</p>
<p>The duke was here, and bid us follow him?</p>
<p>HERMIA Yea, and my father.</p>
<p>HELENA And Hippolyta.</p>
<p>LYSANDER And he bid us follow to the temple.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Why, then, we are awake; let’s follow him</p>
<p>And by 828 the way let us recount our dreams.</p>
<p>Exeunt lovers</p>
<p>Bottom wakes</p>
<p>BOTTOM When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is,
‘Most fair Pyramus.’ Hey-ho! Peter Quince? Flute, the bellows-mender?
Snout, the tinker? Starveling? God’s 829 my life, stolen hence 830 and
left me asleep! I have had a most rare 831 vision. I had a dream, past
the wit 832 of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass, if he go
about 833 to expound this dream. Methought I was—there is no man can
tell what. Methought I was — and methought I had — but man is but a
patched 834 fool if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye
of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man’s hand is not
able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my
dream was 835 . I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream:
it shall be called ‘Bottom’s Dream’, because it hath no bottom 836 ; and
I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the duke.
Peradventure 837 , to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her
838 death.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
