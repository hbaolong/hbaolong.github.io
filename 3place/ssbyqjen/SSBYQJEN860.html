<h4 id="scene-1-3-running-scene-1">Scene 1 3 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester, solus</p>
<p>RICHARD Now is the winter of our discontent</p>
<p>Made glorious summer by this son of York 4 :</p>
<p>And all the clouds that loured 5 upon our house 6</p>
<p>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</p>
<p>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,</p>
<p>Our bruisèd arms 7 hung up for 8 monuments,</p>
<p>Our stern alarums 9 changed to merry meetings,</p>
<p>Our dreadful 10 marches to delightful measures 11 .</p>
<p>Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front 12 ,</p>
<p>And now, instead of mounting barbèd 13 steeds</p>
<p>To fright the souls of fearful 14 adversaries,</p>
<p>He capers 15 nimbly in a lady’s chamber 16</p>
<p>To the lascivious pleasing 17 of a lute.</p>
<p>But I, that am not shaped for sportive 18 tricks 19 ,</p>
<p>Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass 20 :</p>
<p>I, that am rudely stamped 21 , and want 22 love’s majesty</p>
<p>To strut before a wanton 23 ambling 24 nymph:</p>
<p>I, that am curtailed 25 of this fair proportion,</p>
<p>Cheated of feature 26 by dissembling 27 nature,</p>
<p>Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time 28</p>
<p>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up 29 ,</p>
<p>And that so lamely and unfashionable 30</p>
<p>That dogs bark at me as I halt 31 by them —</p>
<p>Why, I, in this weak piping 32 time of peace,</p>
<p>Have no delight to pass away the time,</p>
<p>Unless to see my shadow in the sun</p>
<p>And descant 33 on mine own deformity.</p>
<p>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,</p>
<p>To entertain 34 these fair well-spoken 35 days,</p>
<p>I am determinèd 36 to prove a villain</p>
<p>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</p>
<p>Plots have I laid, inductions 37 dangerous,</p>
<p>By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,</p>
<p>To set my brother Clarence and the king</p>
<p>In deadly hate the one against the other.</p>
<p>And if King Edward be as true and just</p>
<p>As I am subtle 38 , false 39 and treacherous,</p>
<p>This day should Clarence closely be mewed up 40 ,</p>
<p>About 41 a prophecy, which says that ‘G’ 42</p>
<p>Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.</p>
<p>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here Clarence comes.—</p>
<p>Enter Clarence, guarded, and Brackenbury</p>
<p>Brother, good day. What means this armèd guard</p>
<p>That waits upon 43 your grace?</p>
<p>CLARENCE His majesty,</p>
<p>Tend’ring 44 my person’s safety, hath appointed</p>
<p>This conduct 45 to convey me to th’Tower 46 .</p>
<p>RICHARD Upon what cause?</p>
<p>CLARENCE Because my name is George.</p>
<p>RICHARD Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours.</p>
<p>He should, for that, commit 47 your godfathers 48 .</p>
<p>O, belike 49 his majesty hath some intent</p>
<p>That you should be new-christened 50 in the Tower.</p>
<p>But what’s the matter 51 , Clarence, may I know?</p>
<p>CLARENCE Yea, Richard, when I know, but I protest 52</p>
<p>As yet I do not. But, as I can learn,</p>
<p>He hearkens 53 after prophecies and dreams,</p>
<p>And from the cross-row 54 plucks the letter G,</p>
<p>And says a wizard told him that by ‘G’</p>
<p>His issue 55 disinherited should be:</p>
<p>And, for 56 my name of George begins with G,</p>
<p>It follows in his thought that I am he.</p>
<p>These, as I learn, and such like toys 57 as these,</p>
<p>Hath moved his highness to commit me now.</p>
<p>RICHARD Why, this it is when men are ruled by women:</p>
<p>’Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower,</p>
<p>My lady Grey 58 his wife, Clarence, ’tis she</p>
<p>That tempts him to this harsh extremity.</p>
<p>Was it not she and that good man of worship 59 ,</p>
<p>Anthony Woodville 60 , her brother there,</p>
<p>That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,</p>
<p>From whence this present day he is delivered 61 ?</p>
<p>We are not safe, Clarence, we are not safe.</p>
<p>CLARENCE By heaven, I think there is no man secure</p>
<p>But the queen’s kindred and night-walking heralds 62</p>
<p>That trudge betwixt 63 the king and Mistress 64 Shore 65 .</p>
<p>Heard you not what an humble suppliant 66</p>
<p>Lord Hastings was to her, for his delivery 67 ?</p>
<p>RICHARD Humbly complaining 68 to her deity 69</p>
<p>Got my Lord Chamberlain 70 his liberty.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you what: I think it is our way,</p>
<p>If we will keep in favour with the king,</p>
<p>To be her men 71 and wear her livery 72 .</p>
<p>The jealous o’erworn 73 widow 74 and herself,</p>
<p>Since that our brother dubbed them 75 gentlewomen,</p>
<p>Are mighty gossips 76 in our monarchy.</p>
<p>BRACKENBURY I beseech your graces both to pardon me:</p>
<p>His majesty hath straitly given in charge 77</p>
<p>That no man shall have private conference,</p>
<p>Of what degree soever 78 , with your brother.</p>
<p>RICHARD Even so, an 79 please your worship, Brackenbury,</p>
<p>You may partake of anything we say.</p>
<p>We speak no treason, man: we say the king</p>
<p>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen</p>
<p>Well struck in years 80 , fair 81 and not jealous.</p>
<p>We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot,</p>
<p>A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing 82 pleasing tongue,</p>
<p>And that the queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks.</p>
<p>How say you sir? Can you deny all this?</p>
<p>BRACKENBURY With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.</p>
<p>RICHARD Naught to do with Mistress Shore? I tell thee, fellow,</p>
<p>He that doth naught 83 with her, excepting one,</p>
<p>Were best to do it secretly, alone.</p>
<p>BRACKENBURY What one, my lord?</p>
<p>RICHARD Her husband, knave. Wouldst thou betray me 84 ?</p>
<p>BRACKENBURY I do beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal 85</p>
<p>Forbear 86 your conference with the noble duke.</p>
<p>CLARENCE We know thy charge 87 , Brackenbury, and will obey.</p>
<p>RICHARD We are the queen’s abjects 88 , and must obey.—</p>
<p>Brother, farewell. I will unto the king,</p>
<p>And whatsoe’er you will employ me in,</p>
<p>Were it to call King Edward’s widow sister,</p>
<p>I will perform it to enfranchise 89 you.</p>
<p>Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood</p>
<p>Touches 90 me deeper than you can imagine.</p>
<p>Embraces him</p>
<p>CLARENCE I know it pleaseth neither of us well.</p>
<p>RICHARD Well, your imprisonment shall not be long.</p>
<p>I will deliver you or else lie for you 91 .</p>
<p>Meantime, have patience.</p>
<p>CLARENCE I must perforce 92 . Farewell.</p>
<p>Exit Clarence [led by Brackenbury and Guards ]</p>
<p>RICHARD Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne’er return.</p>
<p>Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so</p>
<p>That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,</p>
<p>If heaven will take the present 93 at our hands.</p>
<p>But who comes here? The new-delivered 94 Hastings?</p>
<p>Enter Lord Hastings</p>
<p>HASTINGS Good time of day unto my gracious lord.</p>
<p>RICHARD As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain.</p>
<p>Well are you welcome to this open air.</p>
<p>How hath your lordship brooked 95 imprisonment?</p>
<p>HASTINGS With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must.</p>
<p>But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks 96</p>
<p>That were the cause of my imprisonment.</p>
<p>RICHARD No doubt, no doubt. And so shall Clarence too,</p>
<p>For they that were your enemies are his,</p>
<p>And have prevailed as much on him as you.</p>
<p>HASTINGS More pity that the eagles should be mewed 97 ,</p>
<p>Whiles kites and buzzards 98 play at liberty.</p>
<p>RICHARD What news abroad 99 ?</p>
<p>HASTINGS No news so bad abroad as this at home:</p>
<p>The king is sickly, weak and melancholy,</p>
<p>And his physicians fear him 100 mightily.</p>
<p>RICHARD Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.</p>
<p>O, he hath kept an evil diet 101 long,</p>
<p>And overmuch consumed his royal person.</p>
<p>’Tis very grievous to be thought upon.</p>
<p>Where is he, in his bed?</p>
<p>HASTINGS He is.</p>
<p>RICHARD Go you before, and I will follow you.</p>
<p>Exit Hastings</p>
<p>He cannot live, I hope, and must not die</p>
<p>Till George be packed 102 with post-horse 103 up to heaven.</p>
<p>I’ll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence,</p>
<p>With lies well steeled 104 with weighty arguments.</p>
<p>And, if I fail not in my deep 105 intent,</p>
<p>Clarence hath not another day to live:</p>
<p>Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,</p>
<p>And leave the world for me to bustle 106 in.</p>
<p>For then I’ll marry Warwick’s youngest daughter 107 .</p>
<p>What though I killed her husband 108 and her father 109 ?</p>
<p>The readiest way to make the wench amends</p>
<p>Is to become her husband and her father:</p>
<p>The which will I, not all so much for love</p>
<p>As for another secret close 110 intent,</p>
<p>By marrying her which I must reach unto 111 .</p>
<p>But yet I run before my horse to market 112 :</p>
<p>Clarence still breathes, Edward still lives and reigns.</p>
<p>When they are gone, then must I count my gains.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
