<h4 id="scene-2-955-running-scene-9">Scene 2 955 ／ running scene 9</h4>
<p>Enter Shallow and Silence, with Mouldy, Shadow, Wart, Feeble,
Bullcalf [and Servants ]</p>
<p>SHALLOW Come on, come on, come on. Give me your hand, sir; give me
your hand, sir. An early stirrer, by the rood 956 ! And how doth my good
cousin Silence?</p>
<p>SILENCE Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.</p>
<p>SHALLOW And how doth my cousin, your bedfellow 957 ? And your fairest
daughter and mine, my goddaughter Ellen?</p>
<p>SILENCE Alas, a black 958 ouzel 959 , cousin Shallow!</p>
<p>SHALLOW By yea and nay 960 , sir. I dare say my cousin William is
become a good scholar: he is at Oxford 961 still, is he not?</p>
<p>SILENCE Indeed, sir, to my cost.</p>
<p>SHALLOW He must then to the Inns of Court 962 shortly. I was once of
Clement’s Inn 963 , where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet.</p>
<p>SILENCE You were called ‘lusty 964 Shallow’ then, cousin.</p>
<p>SHALLOW I was called anything, and I would have done anything indeed
too, and roundly 965 too. There was I, and little John Doit 966 of
Staffordshire, and black George Bare, and Francis Pickbone 967 , and
Will Squele 968 , a Cotswold 969 man. You had not four such
swinge-bucklers 970 in all the Inns of Court again. And I may say to
you, we knew where the bona-robas 971 were and had the best of them all
at commandment. Then was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to
Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.</p>
<p>SILENCE This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about
soldiers?</p>
<p>SHALLOW The same Sir John, the very same. I saw him break Scoggin’s
972 head at the court-gate 973 , when he was a crack 974 not thus high.
And the very same day did I fight with one Sampson Stockfish 975 , a
fruiterer, behind Gray’s Inn 976 . O, the mad days that I have spent!
And to see how many of mine old acquaintance are dead!</p>
<p>SILENCE We shall all follow, cousin.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Certain, ’tis certain, very sure, very sure: death is certain
to all, all shall die. How 977 a good yoke of bullocks 978 at Stamford
979 Fair?</p>
<p>SILENCE Truly, cousin, I was not there.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living yet?</p>
<p>SILENCE Dead, sir.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Dead? See, see, he drew a good bow 980 , and dead? He shot a
fine shoot. John of Gaunt 981 loved him well, and betted much money on
his head. Dead? He would have clapped in the clout 982 983 at
twelvescore 984 , and carried you a forehand shaft 985 at fourteen and
fourteen and a half 986 , that it would have done a man’s heart good to
see. How a score 987 of ewes 988 now?</p>
<p>SILENCE Thereafter as they be 989 : a score of good ewes may be worth
ten pounds.</p>
<p>SHALLOW And is old Double dead?</p>
<p>Enter Bardolph and his Boy [Falstaff’s Page ]</p>
<p>SILENCE Here come two of Sir John Falstaff’s men, as I think.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Good morrow, honest gentlemen.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH I beseech 990 you, which is Justice Shallow?</p>
<p>SHALLOW I am Robert Shallow, sir, a poor esquire 991 of this county,
and one of the king’s justices of the peace 992 . What is your good
pleasure with me?</p>
<p>BARDOLPH My captain, sir, commends him to you — my captain, Sir John
Falstaff, a tall 993 gentleman, and a most gallant leader.</p>
<p>SHALLOW He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword 994 man.
How doth the good knight? May I ask how my lady his wife doth?</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Sir, pardon. A soldier is better accommodated 995 than with
a wife.</p>
<p>SHALLOW It is well said, sir; and it is well said indeed too. Better
accommodated! It is good, yea, indeed, is it. Good phrases are surely,
and everywhere, very commendable. Accommodated! It comes of accommodo
996 . Very good, a good phrase 997 .</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Pardon, sir, I have heard the word. Phrase call you it? By
this day, I know not the phrase, but I will maintain the word with my
sword to be a soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good command.
‘Accommodated’, that is when a man is, as they say, accommodated, or
when a man is being whereby he thought to be accommodated, which is an
excellent thing.</p>
<p>Enter Falstaff</p>
<p>SHALLOW It is very just 998 . Look, here comes good Sir John. Give me
your good hand, give me your worship’s good hand. Trust me, you look
well and bear your years very well. Welcome, good Sir John.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert Shallow.—
Master Surecard 999 , as I think?</p>
<p>SHALLOW No, Sir John, it is my cousin Silence, in commission 1000
with me.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of the
peace 1001 .</p>
<p>SILENCE Your good worship is welcome.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Fie, this is hot weather, gentlemen. Have you provided me
here half a dozen of sufficient 1002 men?</p>
<p>SHALLOW Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Let me see them, I beseech you.</p>
<p>They sit</p>
<p>SHALLOW Where’s the roll? Where’s the roll? Where’s the roll? Let me
see, let me see, let me see. So, so, so, so. Yea, marry, sir.— Ralph
Mouldy! Let them appear as I call, let them do so, let them do so. Let
me see, where is Mouldy?</p>
<p>MOULDY Here, if it please you.</p>
<p>SHALLOW What think you, Sir John? A good-limbed fellow: young,
strong, and of good friends 1003 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Is thy name Mouldy?</p>
<p>MOULDY Yea, if it please you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF ’Tis the more time thou wert used.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Ha, ha, ha! Most excellent! Things that are mouldy lack use:
very singular good. Well said, Sir John, very well said.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Prick 1004 him.</p>
<p>MOULDY I was pricked 1005 well enough before, if you could have let
me alone. My old dame 1006 will be undone 1007 now for one to do her
husbandry 1008 and her drudgery 1009 ; you need not to have pricked me.
There are other men fitter to go out than I.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Go to. Peace, Mouldy, you shall go. Mouldy, it is time you
were spent 1010 .</p>
<p>MOULDY Spent?</p>
<p>SHALLOW Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside. Know you where you are?—
For the other 1011 , Sir John, let me see.— Simon Shadow?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Ay, marry, let me have him to sit under: he’s like to be a
cold 1012 soldier.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Where’s Shadow?</p>
<p>SHADOW Here, sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Shadow, whose son 1013 art thou?</p>
<p>SHADOW My mother’s son, sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Thy mother’s son! Like enough, and thy father’s shadow 1014
. So the son of the female is the shadow of the male. It is often so,
indeed, but not of the father’s substance 1015 !</p>
<p>SHALLOW Do you like him, Sir John?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Shadow will serve 1016 for summer. Prick him,— for we have a
number of shadows 1017 to fill up the muster 1018 book.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>SHALLOW Thomas Wart?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Where’s he?</p>
<p>WART Here, sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Is thy name Wart?</p>
<p>WART Yea, sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Thou art a very ragged 1019 wart.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Shall I prick him down, Sir John?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF It were superfluous, for his apparel is built upon his back,
and the whole frame stands upon pins 1020 . Prick him no more.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Ha, ha, ha! You can do it, sir, you can do it. I commend you
well.—Francis Feeble?</p>
<p>FEEBLE Here, sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What trade art thou, Feeble?</p>
<p>FEEBLE A woman’s tailor 1021 , sir.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Shall I prick him, sir?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF You may: but if he had been a man’s tailor, he would have
pricked 1022 you. Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy’s battle 1023
as thou hast done in a woman’s petticoat?</p>
<p>FEEBLE I will do my good will 1024 , sir. You can have no more.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well said, good woman’s tailor! Well said, courageous
Feeble! Thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove or most magnanimous
1025 mouse. Prick the woman’s tailor well, Master Shallow, deep 1026 ,
Master Shallow.</p>
<p>FEEBLE I would Wart might have gone, sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I would thou wert a man’s tailor, that thou mightst mend him
and make him fit to go 1027 . I cannot put him to 1028 a private soldier
that is the leader of so many thousands 1029 . Let that suffice, most
forcible Feeble.</p>
<p>FEEBLE It shall suffice.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble.— Who is the next?</p>
<p>SHALLOW Peter Bullcalf of the green 1030 ?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Yea, marry, let us see Bullcalf.</p>
<p>BULLCALF Here, sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Trust me, a likely 1031 fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalf till
he roar again 1032 .</p>
<p>BULLCALF O, good my lord captain—</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What, dost thou roar before th’art pricked?</p>
<p>BULLCALF O, sir! I am a diseased man.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What disease hast thou?</p>
<p>BULLCALF A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught with
ringing in the king’s affairs 1033 upon his coronation day 1034 ,
sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown 1035 . We will
have away thy cold, and I will take such order 1036 that thy friends
shall ring for thee 1037 .— Is here all?</p>
<p>SHALLOW There is two more called than your number. You must have but
four 1038 here, sir, and so I pray you go in with me to dinner.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry 1039
dinner. I am glad to see you, in good troth, Master Shallow.</p>
<p>SHALLOW O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night in the
Windmill 1040 in St George’s Field 1041 ?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF No more of that, good Master Shallow, no more of that.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Ha, it was a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork 1042
alive?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF She lives, Master Shallow.</p>
<p>SHALLOW She never could away with 1043 me.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Never, never. She would always say she could not abide
Master Shallow.</p>
<p>SHALLOW I could anger her to the heart. She was then a bona-roba 1044
. Doth she hold her own well?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Old, old, Master Shallow.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Nay, she must be old. She cannot choose but be old, certain
she’s old, and had Robin Nightwork by old Nightwork before I came to
Clement’s Inn.</p>
<p>SILENCE That’s fifty-five years ago.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that this
knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.</p>
<p>SHALLOW That we have, that we have, in faith, Sir John, we have. Our
watch-word 1045 was ‘Hem boys!’ Come, let’s to dinner; come, let’s to
dinner. O, the days that we have seen! Come, come.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Falstaff and the Justices ]</p>
<p>BULLCALF Good Master Corporate 1046 Bardolph, stand 1047 my friend,
and here is four Harry ten shillings 1048 in French crowns for you. In
very truth, sir, I had as lief 1049 be hanged, sir, as go. And yet, for
mine own part, sir, I do not care; but rather, because I am unwilling,
and for mine own part, have a desire to stay with my friends 1050 .
Else, sir, I did not care, for mine own part, so much.</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>to Bardolph</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Go to 1051 . Stand aside.</p>
<p>MOULDY And, good master corporal captain, for my old dame’s sake,
stand my friend: she hath nobody to do anything about her when I am
gone, and she is old, and cannot help herself. You shall have forty 1052
, sir.</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Go to. Stand aside.</p>
<p>FEEBLE I care not. A man can die but once: we owe a death. I will
never bear a base mind. If it be my destiny, so 1053 : if it be not, so.
No man is too good to serve his prince, and let it go which way it will,
he that dies this year is quit 1054 for the next.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Well said. Thou art a good fellow.</p>
<p>FEEBLE Nay, I will bear no base mind.</p>
<p>[Enter Falstaff and the Justices ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Come, sir, which men shall I have?</p>
<p>SHALLOW Four of which you please.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Sir, a word with you: I have three pound to free Mouldy and
Bullcalf.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Go to, well.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Come, Sir John, which four will you have?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Do you choose for me.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Marry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble and Shadow.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home till you
are past service 1055 .— And for your part, Bullcalf, grow till you come
unto it 1056 . I will none of you.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong. They are your
likeliest 1057 men, and I would have you served with the best.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a man? Care
I for the limb, the thews 1058 , the stature, bulk, and big assemblance
1059 of a man? Give me the spirit, Master Shallow. Where’s Wart? You see
what a ragged appearance it is. He shall charge you and discharge you
1060 with the motion of a pewterer’s hammer 1061 , come off and on 1062
swifter than he that gibbets on the brewer’s bucket 1063 . And this same
half-faced 1064 fellow, Shadow, give me this man: he presents no mark
1065 to the enemy. The foeman may with as great aim 1066 level 1067 at
the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat, how swiftly will this Feeble,
the woman’s tailor, run off! O, give me the spare 1068 men, and spare me
the great ones. Put me a caliver 1069 into Wart’s hand, Bardolph.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Hold, Wart, traverse 1070 . Thus, thus, thus.</p>
<p>Gives Wart a caliver</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Come, manage me 1071 your caliver. So, very well, go to,
very good, exceeding good. O, give me always a little, lean, old,
chopped 1072 , bald shot 1073 . Well said 1074 , Wart. Thou art a good
scab 1075 . Hold, there is a tester 1076 for thee.</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>SHALLOW He is not his craft’s master. He doth not do it right. I
remember at Mile-End Green 1077 , when I lay at Clement’s Inn—I was then
Sir Dagonet in Arthur’s show 1078 —there was a little quiver 1079
fellow, and he would manage you his piece thus. And he would about and
about, and come 1080 you in and come you in. ‘Ra, ta, ta’, would he say.
‘Bounce’, would he say, and away again would he go, and again would he
come. I shall never see such a fellow.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. Farewell, Master
Silence. I will not use many words with you. Fare you well, gentlemen
both. I thank you. I must 1081 a dozen mile tonight. Bardolph, give the
soldiers coats.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Sir John, heaven bless you and prosper your affairs, and send
us peace! As you return, visit my house. Let our old acquaintance be
renewed. Peradventure 1082 I will with you to the court.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I would 1083 you would, Master Shallow.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Go to. I have spoke at a word 1084 . Fare you well.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Fare you well, gentle 1085 gentlemen.— On, Bardolph. Lead
the men away.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Bardolph, Mouldy, Shadow, Wart, Feeble and Bullcalf ]</p>
<p>As I return, I will fetch off 1086 these justices. I do see the
bottom of Justice Shallow. How subject we old men are to this vice of
lying! This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate 1087 to me
of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he hath done about Turnbull
Street 1088 , and every third word a lie, duer 1089 paid to the hearer
than the Turk’s tribute 1090 . I do remember him at Clement’s Inn like a
man made after supper of a cheese-paring 1091 . When he was naked, he
was, for all the world, like a forked radish, with a head fantastically
carved upon it with a knife. He was so forlorn 1092 , that his
dimensions to any thick 1093 sight were invincible 1094 . He was the
very genius 1095 of famine. He came ever in the rearward 1096 of the
fashion. And now is this Vice’s dagger 1097 become a squire 1098 , and
talks as familiarly of John of Gaunt 1099 as if he had been sworn
brother 1100 to him, and I’ll be sworn he never saw him but once in the
Tilt-yard 1101 , and then he burst his head for crowding among the
marshal’s men 1102 . I saw it, and told John of Gaunt he beat his own
name 1103 , for you might have trussed him 1104 and all his apparel into
an eel-skin 1105 , the case of a treble hautboy 1106 was a mansion for
