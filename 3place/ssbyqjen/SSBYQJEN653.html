7</h4>
<p>Enter King John, Pembroke, Salisbury and other Lords</p>
<p>King John ascends the throne</p>
<p>KING JOHN Here once again we sit: once again crowned,</p>
<p>And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.</p>
<p>PEMBROKE This ‘once again’, but that your highness pleased,</p>
<p>Was once 1173 superfluous: you were crowned before,</p>
<p>And that high royalty was ne’er plucked off:</p>
<p>The faiths of men ne’er stainèd with revolt:</p>
<p>Fresh 1174 expectation troubled not the land</p>
<p>With any longed-for change or better state 1175 .</p>
<p>SALISBURY Therefore, to be possessed 1176 with double pomp 1177 ,</p>
<p>To guard 1178 a title that was rich before,</p>
<p>To gild 1179 refinèd gold, to paint the lily,</p>
<p>To throw a perfume on the violet,</p>
<p>To smooth the ice, or add another hue</p>
<p>Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light 1180</p>
<p>To seek the beauteous eye of heaven 1181 to garnish,</p>
<p>Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.</p>
<p>PEMBROKE But 1182 that your royal pleasure 1183 must be done,</p>
<p>This act is as an ancient tale new told,</p>
<p>And, in the last repeating, troublesome,</p>
<p>Being urgèd at a time unseasonable 1184 .</p>
<p>SALISBURY In this the antique 1185 and well-noted 1186 face</p>
<p>Of plain old form 1187 is much disfigurèd 1188 ,</p>
<p>And, like a shifted 1189 wind unto a sail,</p>
<p>It 1190 makes the course of thoughts to fetch about 1191 ,</p>
<p>Startles and frights consideration 1192 ,</p>
<p>Makes sound 1193 opinion sick and truth suspected,</p>
<p>For putting on so new a fashioned 1194 robe.</p>
<p>PEMBROKE When workmen strive to do better than well,</p>
<p>They do confound 1195 their skill in covetousness,</p>
<p>And oftentimes excusing of a fault</p>
<p>Doth make the fault the worse by th’excuse 1196 :</p>
<p>As patches set upon a little breach 1197</p>
<p>Discredit 1198 more in hiding of the fault</p>
<p>Than did the fault before it was so patched.</p>
<p>SALISBURY To this effect, before you were new crowned 1199 ,</p>
<p>We breathed 1200 our counsel: but it pleased your highness</p>
<p>To overbear 1201 it, and we are all well pleased,</p>
<p>Since all and every part of what we would</p>
<p>Doth make a stand at 1202 what your highness will.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Some reasons of this double coronation</p>
<p>I have possessed you with 1203 , and think them strong.</p>
<p>And more, more strong, than lesser is my fear 1204 ,</p>
<p>I shall indue 1205 you with: meantime but ask</p>
<p>What you would have reformed that is not well,</p>
<p>And well shall you perceive how willingly</p>
<p>I will both hear and grant you your requests.</p>
<p>PEMBROKE Then I, as one that am the tongue 1206 of these,</p>
<p>To sound 1207 the purposes of all their hearts,</p>
<p>Both for myself and them 1208 , but chief of all</p>
<p>Your safety, for the which myself and them</p>
<p>Bend 1209 their best studies 1210 , heartily request</p>
<p>Th’enfranchisement 1211 of Arthur, whose restraint</p>
<p>Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent</p>
<p>To break into this dangerous argument:</p>
<p>If what in rest 1212 you have, in right 1213 you hold,</p>
<p>Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend 1214</p>
<p>The steps of wrong 1215 , should move you to mew up 1216</p>
<p>Your tender 1217 kinsman, and to choke his days</p>
<p>With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth</p>
<p>The rich advantage of good exercise 1218 .</p>
<p>That 1219 the time’s enemies may not have this 1220</p>
<p>To grace occasions 1221 , let it be our suit 1222</p>
<p>That you have bid us ask his liberty,</p>
<p>Which for our goods 1223 we do no further ask</p>
<p>Than, whereupon our weal 1224 on you depending</p>
<p>Counts 1225 it your weal, he have his liberty.</p>
<p>Enter Hubert</p>
<p>KING JOHN Let it be so: I do commit 1226 his youth</p>
<p>To your direction 1227 .—</p>
<p>Hubert, what news with you?</p>
<p>Taking him to one side</p>
<p>PEMBROKE This is the man should do 1228 the bloody deed:</p>
<p>He showed his warrant to a friend of mine:</p>
<p>The image of a wicked heinous 1229 fault</p>
<p>Lives 1230 in his eye: that close 1231 aspect 1232 of his</p>
<p>Do 1233 show the mood of a much troubled breast,</p>
<p>And I do fearfully believe ’tis done,</p>
<p>What we so feared he had a charge 1234 to do.</p>
<p>SALISBURY The colour 1235 of the king doth come and go</p>
<p>Between his purpose and his conscience,</p>
<p>Like heralds ’twixt 1236 two dreadful battles 1237 set:</p>
<p>His passion is so ripe 1238 , it needs must break 1239 .</p>
<p>PEMBROKE And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence</p>
<p>The foul corruption of a sweet child’s death.</p>
<p>KING JOHN We cannot hold 1240 mortality’s strong hand.—</p>
<p>Good lords, although my will to give 1241 is living,</p>
<p>To Lords</p>
<p>The suit which you demand is gone and dead.</p>
<p>He tells us Arthur is deceased tonight 1242 .</p>
<p>SALISBURY Indeed we feared his sickness was past cure.</p>
<p>PEMBROKE Indeed we heard how near his death he was</p>
<p>Before the child himself felt he was sick:</p>
<p>This must be answered 1243 either here or hence 1244 .</p>
<p>KING JOHN Why do you bend such solemn brows 1245 on me?</p>
<p>Think you I bear the shears of destiny 1246 ?</p>
<p>Have I commandment on 1247 the pulse of life?</p>
<p>SALISBURY It is apparent 1248 foul play, and ’tis shame</p>
<p>That greatness 1249 should so grossly 1250 offer 1251 it:</p>
<p>So 1252 thrive it in your game 1253 , and so farewell.</p>
<p>PEMBROKE Stay yet, Lord Salisbury: I’ll go with thee,</p>
<p>And find th’inheritance of this poor child,</p>
<p>His little kingdom of a forcèd 1254 grave.</p>
<p>That blood which owed 1255 the breadth of all this isle,</p>
<p>Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while 1256 :</p>
<p>This must not be thus borne: this will break out</p>
<p>To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt 1257 .</p>
<p>Exeunt [Lords ]</p>
<p>KING JOHN They burn in indignation: I repent:</p>
<p>There is no sure 1258 foundation set 1259 on blood:</p>
<p>No certain life achieved by others’ death.</p>
<p>Enter [a ] Messenger</p>
<p>A fearful 1260 eye thou hast. Where is that blood</p>
<p>That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?</p>
<p>So foul a sky clears not without a storm:</p>
<p>Pour down thy weather 1261 : how goes all in France?</p>
<p>MESSENGER From France to England 1262 : never such a power 1263</p>
<p>For any foreign preparation 1264</p>
<p>Was levied 1265 in the body 1266 of a land.</p>
<p>The copy 1267 of your speed is learned by them:</p>
<p>For when you should be told they do prepare,</p>
<p>The tidings comes that they are all arrived.</p>
<p>KING JOHN O, where hath our intelligence 1268 been drunk?</p>
<p>Where hath it slept? Where is my mother’s care 1269 ,</p>
<p>That such an army could be drawn 1270 in France,</p>
<p>And she not hear of it?</p>
<p>MESSENGER My liege, her ear</p>
<p>Is stopped with dust: the first of April died</p>
<p>Your noble mother; and as I hear, my lord,</p>
<p>The lady Constance in a frenzy 1271 died</p>
<p>Three days before: but this from Rumour’s tongue</p>
<p>I idly 1272 heard: if true or false I know not.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Withhold thy speed, dreadful Occasion 1273 :</p>
<p>O, make a league 1274 with me, till I have pleased</p>
<p>My discontented peers. What? Mother dead?</p>
<p>How wildly 1275 then walks 1276 my estate 1277 in France!—</p>
<p>Under whose conduct 1278 came those powers of France</p>
<p>That thou for truth giv’st out 1279 are landed here?</p>
<p>MESSENGER Under the dauphin.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Thou hast made me giddy</p>
<p>With these ill tidings.</p>
<p>Enter [the ] Bastard and Peter of Pomfret 1280</p>
<p>Now, what says the world</p>
<p>To your proceedings 1281 ? Do not seek to stuff</p>
<p>My head with more ill news, for it is full.</p>
<p>BASTARD But if you be afeard 1282 to hear the worst,</p>
<p>Then let the worst unheard fall on your head 1283 .</p>
<p>KING JOHN Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed 1284</p>
<p>Under the tide 1285 : but now I breathe again</p>
<p>Aloft 1286 the flood, and can give audience</p>
<p>To any tongue, speak it of what it will.</p>
<p>BASTARD How I have sped 1287 among the clergymen,</p>
<p>The sums I have collected shall express 1288 :</p>
<p>But as I travelled hither through the land,</p>
<p>I find the people strangely fantasied 1289 :</p>
<p>Possessed with rumours, full of idle 1290 dreams,</p>
<p>Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear.</p>
<p>And here’s a prophet that I brought with me</p>
<p>From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found</p>
<p>With many hundreds treading on his heels 1291 :</p>
<p>To whom he sung in rude 1292 harsh-sounding rhymes,</p>
<p>That ere the next Ascension Day 1293 at noon,</p>
<p>Your highness should deliver up 1294 your crown.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?</p>
<p>PETER Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Hubert, away with him: imprison him,</p>
<p>And on that day at noon, whereon he says</p>
<p>I shall yield up my crown, let him be hanged.</p>
<p>Deliver him to safety 1295 , and return,</p>
<p>For I must use thee.—</p>
<p>[Exeunt Hubert and Peter ]</p>
<p>O my gentle 1296 cousin,</p>
<p>Hear’st thou the news abroad 1297 , who are arrived?</p>
<p>BASTARD The French, my lord: men’s mouths are full of it.</p>
<p>Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,</p>
<p>With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,</p>
<p>And others more, going to seek the grave</p>
<p>Of Arthur, who they say is 1298 killed tonight 1299</p>
<p>On your suggestion 1300 .</p>
<p>KING JOHN Gentle kinsman, go,</p>
<p>And thrust thyself into their companies.</p>
<p>I have a way to win their loves again:</p>
<p>Bring them before me.</p>
<p>BASTARD I will seek them out.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Nay, but make haste: the better foot before 1301 .</p>
<p>O, let me have no subject enemies 1302 ,</p>
<p>When adverse 1303 foreigners affright my towns</p>
<p>With dreadful pomp of stout 1304 invasion.</p>
<p>Be Mercury 1305 , set feathers to thy heels,</p>
<p>And fly like thought from them to me again.</p>
<p>BASTARD The spirit of the time 1306 shall teach me speed.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KING JOHN Spoke like a sprightful 1307 noble gentleman.</p>
<p>Go after him: for he perhaps shall need</p>
<p>Some messenger betwixt 1308 me and the peers,</p>
<p>And be thou he.</p>
<p>MESSENGER With all my heart, my liege.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>KING JOHN My mother dead!</p>
<p>Enter Hubert</p>
<p>HUBERT My lord, they say five moons were seen tonight 1309 :</p>
<p>Four fixèd, and the fifth did whirl about</p>
<p>The other four in wondrous 1310 motion.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Five moons?</p>
<p>HUBERT Old men and beldams 1311 in the streets</p>
<p>Do prophesy upon it 1312 dangerously:</p>
<p>Young Arthur’s death is common in their mouths,</p>
<p>And when they talk of him, they shake their heads</p>
<p>And whisper one 1313 another in the ear.</p>
<p>And he that speaks doth grip the hearer’s wrist,</p>
<p>Whilst he that hears makes fearful action 1314 ,</p>
<p>With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.</p>
<p>I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,</p>
<p>The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,</p>
<p>With open mouth swallowing a tailor’s news,</p>
<p>Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,</p>
<p>Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste</p>
<p>Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet 1315 ,</p>
<p>Told of a many thousand 1316 warlike French</p>
<p>That were embattailèd 1317 and ranked 1318 in Kent.</p>
<p>Another lean, unwashed artificer 1319</p>
<p>Cuts off his tale, and talks of Arthur’s death.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Why seek’st thou to possess 1320 me with these fears?</p>
<p>Why urgest thou 1321 so oft 1322 young Arthur’s death?</p>
<p>Thy hand hath murdered him: I had a mighty cause 1323</p>
<p>To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.</p>
<p>HUBERT No had 1324 , my lord! Why, did you not provoke 1325 me?</p>
<p>KING JOHN It is the curse of kings to be attended</p>
<p>By slaves that take their humours 1326 for a warrant</p>
<p>To break within the bloody house of life 1327 ,</p>
<p>And on the winking 1328 of authority</p>
<p>To understand a law 1329 , to know the meaning</p>
<p>Of dangerous 1330 majesty, when perchance 1331 it frowns</p>
<p>More upon humour 1332 than advised respect 1333 .</p>
<p>HUBERT Here is your hand 1334 and seal for what I did.</p>
<p>He shows a paper</p>
<p>KING JOHN O, when the last account 1335 ’twixt heaven and earth</p>
<p>Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal</p>
<p>Witness against us to damnation.</p>
<p>How oft the sight of means to do 1336 ill deeds</p>
<p>Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by 1337 ,</p>
<p>A fellow by the hand of nature marked 1338 ,</p>
<p>Quoted 1339 and signed 1340 to do a deed of shame,</p>
<p>This murder had not come into my mind.</p>
<p>But taking note of thy abhorred aspect 1341 ,</p>
<p>Finding thee fit for bloody villainy,</p>
<p>Apt, liable 1342 to be employed in danger,</p>
<p>I faintly 1343 broke 1344 with thee of Arthur’s death:</p>
<p>And thou, to be endearèd to a king,</p>
<p>Made it no conscience 1345 to destroy a prince.</p>
<p>HUBERT My lord—</p>
<p>KING JOHN Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause</p>
<p>When I spake darkly 1346 what I purposèd,</p>
<p>Or turned an eye of doubt upon my face,</p>
<p>As 1347 bid me tell my tale in express 1348 words,</p>
<p>Deep shame had 1349 struck me dumb, made me break off,</p>
<p>And those thy fears might have wrought 1350 fears in me.</p>
<p>But thou didst understand me by my signs</p>
<p>And didst in signs again parley 1351 with sin:</p>
<p>Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,</p>
<p>And consequently thy rude 1352 hand to act</p>
<p>The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.</p>
<p>Out of my sight, and never see me more!</p>
<p>My nobles leave me, and my state 1353 is braved 1354 ,</p>
<p>Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers;</p>
<p>Nay, in the body of this fleshly land 1355 ,</p>
<p>This kingdom, this confine 1356 of blood and breath,</p>
<p>Hostility and civil tumult 1357 reigns</p>
<p>Between my conscience and my cousin’s death.</p>
<p>HUBERT Arm you against your other enemies:</p>
<p>I’ll make a peace between your soul and you.</p>
<p>Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine</p>
<p>Is yet a maiden 1358 and an innocent hand,</p>
<p>Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.</p>
<p>Within this bosom never entered yet</p>
<p>The dreadful motion 1359 of a murderous thought;</p>
<p>And you have slandered nature in my form 1360 ,</p>
<p>Which, howsoever rude exteriorly 1361 ,</p>
<p>Is yet the cover of a fairer mind</p>
<p>Than to be butcher of an innocent child.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers:</p>
<p>Throw 1362 this report on their incensèd rage,</p>
<p>And make them tame 1363 to their obedience.</p>
<p>Forgive the comment that my passion made</p>
<p>Upon thy feature, for my rage was blind,</p>
<p>And foul imaginary 1364 eyes of blood 1365</p>
<p>Presented thee more hideous than thou art.</p>
<p>O, answer not, but to my closet 1366 bring</p>
<p>The angry lords with all expedient haste.</p>
<p>I conjure 1367 thee but slowly: run more fast.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
