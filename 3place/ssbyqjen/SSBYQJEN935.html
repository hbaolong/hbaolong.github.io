<h4 id="scene-1-24-running-scene-1">Scene 1 24 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Music. Enter Hymen 25 with a torch burning, a Boy, in a white robe,
before, singing and strewing flowers; after Hymen, a Nymph 26 ,
encompassed 27 in her tresses, bearing a wheaten garland 28 . Then
Theseus between two other Nymphs with wheaten chaplets 29 on their
heads. Then Hippolyta the bride, led by [Pirithous ], and another
holding a garland over her head, her tresses likewise hanging. After her
Emilia 30 , holding up her train.</p>
<p>The song</p>
<p>BOY Roses their sharp spines being gone,</p>
<p>Not royal in their smells alone,</p>
<p>But in their hue 31 .</p>
<p>Maiden pinks, of odour faint,</p>
<p>Daisies smell-less, yet most quaint 32</p>
<p>And sweet thyme true.</p>
<p>Primrose, first-born child of Ver 33 ,</p>
<p>Merry springtime’s harbinger 34 ,</p>
<p>With harebells dim,</p>
<p>Oxlips in their cradles 35 growing,</p>
<p>Marigolds on deathbeds blowing 36 ,</p>
<p>Lark’s-heels 37 trim.</p>
<p>All dear Nature’s children sweet,</p>
<p>Lie ’fore bride and bridegroom’s feet,</p>
<p>Strew flowers</p>
<p>Blessing their sense 38 .</p>
<p>Not an angel of the air,</p>
<p>Bird melodious, or bird fair,</p>
<p>Is absent hence.</p>
<p>The crow, the sland’rous 39 cuckoo, nor</p>
<p>The boding 40 raven, nor chough hoar 41</p>
<p>Nor chatt’ring ’pie 42 ,</p>
<p>May on our bride-house 43 perch or sing,</p>
<p>Or with them any discord bring,</p>
<p>But from it fly.</p>
<p>Enter three Queens in black, with veils stained 44 , with imperial
crowns. The First Queen falls down at the foot of Theseus, the second
falls down at the foot of Hippolyta, the third before Emilia</p>
<p>FIRST QUEEN For pity’s sake and</p>
<p>true gentility’s,</p>
<p>To Theseus</p>
<p>Hear and respect 45 me.</p>
<p>SECOND QUEEN For your mother’s sake</p>
<p>To Hippolyta</p>
<p>And as you wish your womb may thrive with fair ones,</p>
<p>Hear and respect me,</p>
<p>THIRD QUEEN Now for the love of him whom Jove 46 hath marked</p>
<p>To Emilia</p>
<p>The honour of your bed 47 and for the sake</p>
<p>Of clear virginity, be advocate</p>
<p>For us and our distresses: this good deed</p>
<p>Shall raze 48 you out o’th’book of trespasses 49</p>
<p>All you are set down there.</p>
<p>THESEUS Sad lady, rise.</p>
<p>To First Queen</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA Stand up.</p>
<p>To Second Queen</p>
<p>EMILIA No knees 50 to me.</p>
<p>To Third Queen</p>
<p>What woman I may stead 51 that is distressed</p>
<p>Does bind me to her.</p>
<p>Second and Third Queens may rise here while First</p>
<p>Queen continues to kneel, or all three may continue kneeling</p>
<p>THESEUS What’s your request?</p>
<p>Deliver you for all.</p>
<p>To First Queen</p>
<p>FIRST QUEEN We are three queens, whose sovereigns fell before</p>
<p>The wrath of cruel Creon 52 , who endured</p>
<p>The beaks of ravens, talons of the kites</p>
<p>And pecks of crows in the foul fields of Thebes.</p>
<p>He will not suffer 53 us to burn their bones,</p>
<p>To urn their ashes, nor to take th’offence</p>
<p>Of mortal loathsomeness from the blest eye</p>
<p>Of holy Phoebus 54 , but infects the winds</p>
<p>With stench of our slain lords. O pity, duke,</p>
<p>Thou purger 55 of the earth, draw thy feared sword</p>
<p>That does good turns to th’world: give us the bones</p>
<p>Of our dead kings that we may chapel 56 them:</p>
<p>And of 57 thy boundless goodness take some note 58</p>
<p>That for our crownèd heads we have no roof,</p>
<p>Save this which is the lion’s and the bear’s,</p>
<p>And vault 59 to everything.</p>
<p>THESEUS Pray you, kneel not:</p>
<p>I was transported 60 with your speech and suffered</p>
<p>Your knees to wrong themselves 61 . I have heard the fortunes</p>
<p>Of your dead lords, which gives me such lamenting</p>
<p>As wakes my vengeance and revenge for ’em.—</p>
<p>King Capaneus was your lord.</p>
<p>The day</p>
<p>To First Queen</p>
<p>That he should 62 marry you, at such a season</p>
<p>As now it is with me, I met your groom.</p>
<p>By Mars’s 63 altar you were that time fair:</p>
<p>Not Juno 64 ’s mantle fairer than your tresses,</p>
<p>Nor in more bounty spread her. Your wheaten wreath</p>
<p>Was then nor threshed nor blasted 65 : Fortune at you</p>
<p>Dimpled her cheek with smiles. Hercules 66 our kinsman —</p>
<p>Then weaker than your eyes — laid by his club:</p>
<p>He tumbled down upon his Nemean 67 hide</p>
<p>And swore his sinews thawed 68 . O grief and time,</p>
<p>Fearful consumers, you will all devour!</p>
<p>FIRST QUEEN O, I hope some god,</p>
<p>Some god hath put his mercy in your manhood,</p>
<p>Whereto 69 he’ll infuse power, and press you forth</p>
<p>Our undertaker 70 .</p>
<p>THESEUS O, no knees, none, widow!</p>
<p>Unto the helmeted Bellona 71 use them,</p>
<p>And pray for me, your soldier.</p>
<p>First Queen rises</p>
<p>Troubled I am.</p>
<p>Turns away</p>
<p>SECOND QUEEN Honoured Hippolyta,</p>
<p>Kneeling</p>
<p>Most dreaded Amazonian, that hast slain</p>
<p>The scythe-tusked boar, that with thy arm, as strong</p>
<p>As it is white, wast 72 near to make 73 the male</p>
<p>To thy sex captive, but that this thy lord</p>
<p>Born to uphold creation in 74 that honour</p>
<p>First nature styled it in, shrunk thee into</p>
<p>The bound 75 thou wast o’er-flowing, at once subduing</p>
<p>Thy force and thy affection, soldieress,</p>
<p>That equally canst poise 76 sternness with pity,</p>
<p>Whom now I know hast much more power on him</p>
<p>Than ever he had on thee, who ow’st 77 his strength</p>
<p>And his love too, who is a servant for</p>
<p>The tenor 78 of the speech, dear glass 79 of ladies:</p>
<p>Bid him that we, whom flaming war doth scorch,</p>
<p>Under the shadow of his sword may cool us:</p>
<p>Require him he advance it o’er our heads.</p>
<p>Speak’t in a woman’s key 80 , like such a woman</p>
<p>As any of us three: weep ere you fail,</p>
<p>Lend us a knee 81 ,</p>
<p>But touch the ground for us no longer time</p>
<p>Than a dove’s motion when the head’s plucked off.</p>
<p>Tell him if he i’th’blood-sized 82 field lay swoll’n,</p>
<p>Showing the sun his teeth, grinning at the moon,</p>
<p>What you would do.</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA Poor lady say no more:</p>
<p>I had as lief 83 trace 84 this good action with you</p>
<p>As that whereto I am going, and never yet</p>
<p>Went I so willing way. My lord is taken 85</p>
<p>Heart deep with your distress: let him consider:</p>
<p>I’ll speak anon.</p>
<p>Second Queen rises</p>
<p>THIRD QUEEN O, my petition was</p>
<p>Kneel to Emilia</p>
<p>Set down in ice 86 , which by hot grief uncandied 87</p>
<p>Melts into drops: so sorrow wanting form 88</p>
<p>Is pressed with deeper matter 89 .</p>
<p>EMILIA Pray stand up:</p>
<p>Your grief is written in your cheek.</p>
<p>THIRD QUEEN O, woe,</p>
<p>Third Queen rises</p>
<p>You cannot read it there: there, through my tears,</p>
<p>Like wrinkled pebbles in a glass stream,</p>
<p>You may behold ’em — lady, lady, alack —</p>
<p>He that will all the treasure know o’th’earth</p>
<p>Must know the centre too 90 : he that will fish</p>
<p>For my least minnow, let him lead his line</p>
<p>To catch one at my heart. O, pardon me,</p>
<p>Extremity, that sharpens sundry wits 91 ,</p>
<p>Makes me a fool.</p>
<p>EMILIA Pray you say nothing, pray you.</p>
<p>Who cannot feel nor see the rain, being in’t,</p>
<p>Knows neither wet nor dry. If that you were</p>
<p>The ground-piece 92 of some painter, I would buy you</p>
<p>T’instruct me gainst 93 a capital 94 grief indeed</p>
<p>Such heart-pierced demonstration: but alas,</p>
<p>Being a natural 95 sister of our sex,</p>
<p>Your sorrow beats so ardently 96 upon me</p>
<p>That it shall make a counter-reflect 97 gainst</p>
<p>My brother’s heart, and warm it to some pity,</p>
<p>Though it were made of stone. Pray have good comfort.</p>
<p>THESEUS Forward to th’temple! Leave not out a jot 98</p>
<p>O’th’sacred ceremony.</p>
<p>FIRST QUEEN O, this celebration</p>
<p>Will longer last and be more costly than</p>
<p>Your suppliants’ 99 war! Remember that your fame</p>
<p>Knolls 100 in the ear o’th’world: what you do quickly</p>
<p>Is not done rashly: your first thought is more</p>
<p>Than others’ laboured meditance 101 , your pre-meditating</p>
<p>More than their actions. But, O Jove, your actions,</p>
<p>Soon as they move, as ospreys 102 do the fish,</p>
<p>Subdue before they touch. Think, dear duke, think</p>
<p>What beds our slain kings have.</p>
<p>SECOND QUEEN What griefs our beds,</p>
<p>That our dear lords have none.</p>
<p>THIRD QUEEN None fit for th’dead:</p>
<p>Those that with cords, knives, drams 103 ’ precipitance 104 ,</p>
<p>Weary of this world’s light, have to themselves</p>
<p>Been death’s most horrid agents, humane grace</p>
<p>Affords them dust and shadow.</p>
<p>FIRST QUEEN But our lords</p>
<p>Lie blist’ring ’fore the visitating 105 sun,</p>
<p>And were good kings, when living.</p>
<p>THESEUS It is true, and I will give you comfort,</p>
<p>To give 106 your dead lords graves:</p>
<p>The which to do must make some work with Creon.</p>
<p>FIRST QUEEN And that work presents itself to th’doing 107 :</p>
<p>Now ’twill take form, the heats are gone tomorrow:</p>
<p>Then, bootless 108 toil must recompense itself</p>
<p>With its own sweat: now he’s secure,</p>
<p>Not dreams, we stand before your puissance 109</p>
<p>Rinsing our holy begging in our eyes</p>
<p>To make petition clear 110 .</p>
<p>SECOND QUEEN Now you may take him,</p>
<p>Drunk with his victory.</p>
<p>THIRD QUEEN And his army full</p>
<p>Of bread and sloth.</p>
<p>THESEUS Artesius, that best knowest</p>
<p>To Officer</p>
<p>How to draw out 111 fit to this enterprise</p>
<p>The prim’st 112 for this proceeding and the number</p>
<p>To carry such a business, forth and levy 113</p>
<p>Our worthiest instruments 114 , whilst we dispatch</p>
<p>This grand act of our life, this daring deed</p>
<p>Of fate in wedlock.</p>
<p>FIRST QUEEN Dowagers,</p>
<p>To the other Queens</p>
<p>take hands.</p>
<p>Let us be widows to our woes 115 : delay</p>
<p>Commends us to a famishing 116 hope.</p>
<p>ALL QUEENS Farewell.</p>
<p>SECOND QUEEN We come unseasonably: but when could grief</p>
<p>Cull 117 forth, as unpanged 118 judgement can, fitt’st time</p>
<p>For best solicitation?</p>
<p>THESEUS Why, good ladies,</p>
<p>This is a service 119 , whereto I am going,</p>
<p>Greater than any war: it more imports 120 me</p>
<p>Than all the actions that I have foregone 121 ,</p>
<p>Or futurely can cope 122 .</p>
<p>FIRST QUEEN The more proclaiming 123</p>
<p>Our suit shall be neglected, when her arms,</p>
<p>Able to lock 124 Jove from a synod 125 , shall</p>
<p>By warranting 126 moonlight corslet 127 thee: O, when</p>
<p>Her twinning cherries 128 shall their sweetness fall</p>
<p>Upon thy taste-full 129 lips, what wilt thou think</p>
<p>Of rotten kings or blubbered 130 queens? What care</p>
<p>For what thou feel’st not,what thou feel’st being able</p>
<p>To make Mars spurn his drum? O, if thou couch</p>
<p>But one night with her, every hour in’t will</p>
<p>Take hostage of thee for a hundred and</p>
<p>Thou shalt remember nothing more, than what</p>
<p>That banquet bids 131 thee to.</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA Though much unlike 132</p>
<p>To Theseus</p>
<p>You should be so transported, as much sorry</p>
<p>I should be such a suitor, yet I think</p>
<p>Did I not by th’abstaining of my joy</p>
<p>Which breeds a deeper longing, cure their surfeit 133</p>
<p>That craves a present 134 med’cine, I should pluck 135</p>
<p>All ladies’ scandal 136 on me. Therefore, sir</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>As I shall here make trial of my prayers,</p>
<p>Either presuming them to have some force,</p>
<p>Or sentencing for aye 137 their vigour dumb,</p>
<p>Prorogue 138 this business we are going about and hang</p>
<p>Your shield afore your heart, about that neck</p>
<p>Which is my fee 139 and which I freely lend</p>
<p>To do these poor queens service.</p>
<p>ALL QUEENS O, help now,</p>
<p>To Emilia</p>
<p>Our cause cries for your knee.</p>
<p>EMILIA If you grant not</p>
<p>Kneels to Theseus</p>
<p>My sister her petition in that force,</p>
<p>With that celerity and nature, which</p>
<p>She makes it in, from henceforth I’ll not dare</p>
<p>To ask you anything, nor be so hardy 140</p>
<p>Ever to take a husband.</p>
<p>THESEUS Pray stand up.</p>
<p>They rise</p>
<p>I am entreating of myself to do</p>
<p>That which you kneel to have me.— Pirithous,</p>
<p>Lead on the bride: get you 141 and pray the gods</p>
<p>For success and return: omit not anything</p>
<p>In the pretended 142 celebration.— Queens,</p>
<p>Follow your soldier.—</p>
<p>As before, hence you,</p>
<p>To Officer</p>
<p>And at the banks of Aulis 143 meet us with</p>
<p>The forces you can raise, where we shall find</p>
<p>The moiety 144 of a number for a business</p>
<p>More bigger look’t 145 .—</p>
<p>[Exit Officer ]</p>
<p>Since that our theme is haste,</p>
<p>I stamp this kiss upon thy current 146 lip:</p>
<p>Sweet, keep it as my token. Set you forward,</p>
<p>For I will see you gone.—</p>
<p>[They begin to ] exeunt towards the temple</p>
<p>Farewell, my beauteous sister.— Pirithous,</p>
<p>Keep the feast full 147 , bate 148 not an hour on’t.</p>
<p>PIRITHOUS Sir,</p>
<p>I’ll follow you at heels: the feast’s solemnity 149</p>
<p>Shall want 150 till your return.</p>
<p>THESEUS Cousin 151 , I charge you</p>
<p>Budge not from Athens: we shall be returning</p>
<p>Ere you can end this feast, of which I pray you</p>
<p>Make no abatement 152 .— Once more, farewell all.</p>
<p>[Exeunt all except Theseus and Queens ]</p>
<p>FIRST QUEEN Thus dost thou still make good the tongue o’th’world 153
—</p>
<p>SECOND QUEEN And earn’st a deity equal with Mars—</p>
<p>THIRD QUEEN If not above him, for</p>
<p>Thou, being but mortal, mak’st affections 154 bend</p>
<p>To godlike honours: they themselves, some say,</p>
<p>Groan under such a mast’ry.</p>
<p>THESEUS As we are men,</p>
<p>Thus should we do, being sensually subdued 155</p>
<p>We lose our human title 156 . Good cheer, ladies:</p>
<p>Now turn we towards your comforts.</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt</p>
