1192</h4>
<p>Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one another [the First holding a paper
]</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN You’re well met once again.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN So are you.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN You come to take your stand here, and behold</p>
<p>The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN ’Tis all my business 1193 . At our last
encounter,</p>
<p>The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN ’Tis very true. But that time offered sorrow,</p>
<p>This, general 1194 joy.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN ’Tis well: the citizens,</p>
<p>I am sure, have shown at full their royal 1195 minds —</p>
<p>As, let ’em have their rights 1196 , they are ever forward 1197 —</p>
<p>In celebration of this day with shows,</p>
<p>Pageants and sights of honour.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Never greater,</p>
<p>Nor, I’ll assure you, better taken 1198 , sir.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN May I be bold to ask what that contains,</p>
<p>That paper in your hand?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes, ’tis the list</p>
<p>Of those that claim their offices this day</p>
<p>By custom of the coronation.</p>
<p>The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims</p>
<p>To be High Steward 1199 : next, the Duke of Norfolk,</p>
<p>He to be Earl Marshal 1200 : you may read the rest.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,</p>
<p>I should have been beholding 1201 to your paper:</p>
<p>But I beseech you, what’s become of Katherine,</p>
<p>The Princess Dowager? How goes her business?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN That I can tell you too. The Archbishop</p>
<p>Of Canterbury, accompanied with other</p>
<p>Learnèd and reverend fathers of his order 1202 ,</p>
<p>Held a late 1203 court at Dunstable 1204 , six miles off</p>
<p>From Ampthill 1205 , where the princess lay 1206 : to which</p>
<p>She was often cited 1207 by them, but appeared not:</p>
<p>And, to be short 1208 , for not appearance and</p>
<p>The king’s late scruple 1209 , by the main assent 1210</p>
<p>Of all these learnèd men she was divorced,</p>
<p>And the late marriage made of none effect 1211 ,</p>
<p>Since which she was removed to Kimbolton 1212 ,</p>
<p>Where she remains now sick.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Alas, good lady.</p>
<p>Trumpets</p>
<p>The trumpets sound: stand close 1213 , the queen is coming.</p>
<p>Hautboys</p>
<p>The Order of the Coronation</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A lively flourish 1214 of Trumpets.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, [enter ] two Judges.</p></li>
<li><p>Lord Chancellor, with purse and mace before him.</p></li>
<li><p>Choristers, singing. Music [being played by musicians ].</p></li>
<li><p>Mayor of London, bearing the mace. Then Garter 1215 , in his coat
of arms, and on his head he wore a gilt copper crown.</p></li>
<li><p>Marquis Dorset, bearing a sceptre of gold, on his head a
demi-coronal 1216 of gold. With him, the Earl of Surrey, bearing the rod
of silver with the dove 1217 , crowned with an earl’s coronet. Collars
of esses 1218 .</p></li>
<li><p>Duke of Suffolk, in his robe of estate 1219 , his coronet on his
head, bearing a long white wand, as High Steward. With him, the Duke of
Norfolk, with the rod of marshalship, a coronet on his head. Collars of
esses.</p></li>
<li><p>A canopy, borne by four [Barons ] of the Cinque Ports 1220 ,
under it the Queen [Anne ] in her robe, in her hair 1221 , richly
adorned with pearl, crowned. On each side her, the Bishops of London and
Winchester.</p></li>
<li><p>The old Duchess of Norfolk, in a coronal 1222 of gold, wrought
with flowers, bearing the Queen’s train 1223 .</p></li>
<li><p>Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plain circlets of gold without
flowers. Exeunt, first passing over the stage in order and state [while
being discussed by the Gentlemen ]</p></li>
</ol>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN A royal train 1224 , believe me: these I know.</p>
<p>Who’s that that bears the sceptre?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Marquis Dorset,</p>
<p>And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN A bold brave gentleman. That should 1225 be</p>
<p>The Duke of Suffolk?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN ’Tis the same: High Steward.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN And that my lord of Norfolk?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Heaven bless thee!</p>
<p>He sees Anne</p>
<p>Thou hast the sweetest face I ever looked on.—</p>
<p>Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel:</p>
<p>Our king has all the Indies 1226 in his arms,</p>
<p>And more, and richer, when he strains 1227 that lady:</p>
<p>I cannot blame his conscience 1228 .</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN They that bear</p>
<p>The cloth of honour 1229 over her, are four barons</p>
<p>Of the Cinque Ports 1230 .</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Those men are happy,</p>
<p>And so are all are near her.</p>
<p>I take it she that carries up the train</p>
<p>Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN It is, and all the rest are countesses.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed,</p>
<p>And sometimes falling 1231 ones.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN No more of that.</p>
<p>[Exit the end of the procession, ] and then a great flourish of
Trumpets</p>
<p>Enter a Third Gentleman</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN God save you, sir. Where have you been broiling 1232
?</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN Among the crowd i’th’Abbey 1233 , where a finger</p>
<p>Could not be wedged in more 1234 : I am stifled</p>
<p>With the mere 1235 rankness 1236 of their joy.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN You saw</p>
<p>The ceremony?</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN That I did.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN How was it?</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN Well worth the seeing.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Good sir, speak 1237 it to us.</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN As well as I am able. The rich stream</p>
<p>Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen</p>
<p>To a prepared place in the choir, fell off 1238</p>
<p>A distance from her, while her grace sat down</p>
<p>To rest a while, some half an hour or so,</p>
<p>In a rich chair of state, opposing 1239 freely</p>
<p>The beauty of her person to the people.</p>
<p>Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest 1240 woman</p>
<p>That ever lay by man: which when the people</p>
<p>Had the full view of, such a noise arose 1241</p>
<p>As the shrouds 1242 make at sea in a stiff 1243 tempest,</p>
<p>As loud, and to as many tunes. Hats, cloaks —</p>
<p>Doublets 1244 , I think — flew up, and had their faces</p>
<p>Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy</p>
<p>I never saw before. Great-bellied 1245 women,</p>
<p>That had not half a week to go, like rams 1246</p>
<p>In the old time of war, would shake the press 1247</p>
<p>And make ’em reel before ’em. No man living</p>
<p>Could say ‘This is my wife’ there, all were woven</p>
<p>So strangely in one piece.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN But, what followed?</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN At length her grace rose, and with modest paces</p>
<p>Came to the altar, where she kneeled, and saint-like</p>
<p>Cast her fair eyes to heaven and prayed devoutly.</p>
<p>Then rose again and bowed her to the people:</p>
<p>When by the Archbishop of Canterbury</p>
<p>She had all the royal makings 1248 of a queen,</p>
<p>As 1249 holy oil, Edward Confessor’s crown,</p>
<p>The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems</p>
<p>Laid nobly on her: which performed, the choir,</p>
<p>With all the choicest music 1250 of the kingdom,</p>
<p>Together sung Te Deum 1251 . So she parted 1252 ,</p>
<p>And with the same full state 1253 paced back again</p>
<p>To York Place, where the feast is held.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Sir,</p>
<p>You must no more call it York Place, that’s past:</p>
<p>For, since the cardinal fell, that title’s lost:</p>
<p>’Tis now the king’s, and called Whitehall.</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN I know it;</p>
<p>But ’tis so lately 1254 altered, that the old name</p>
<p>Is fresh about me.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN What two reverend bishops</p>
<p>Were those that went on each side of the queen?</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN Stokesley and Gardiner, the one 1255 of
Winchester,</p>
<p>Newly preferred 1256 from the king’s secretary:</p>
<p>The other, London.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN He of Winchester</p>
<p>Is held no great good lover of the archbishop’s,</p>
<p>The virtuous Cranmer.</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN All the land knows that:</p>
<p>However, yet there is no great breach: when it comes,</p>
<p>Cranmer will 1257 find a friend will not shrink from him.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN Who may that be, I pray you?</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN Thomas Cromwell;</p>
<p>A man in much esteem with th’king, and truly</p>
<p>A worthy friend. The king has made him</p>
<p>Master o’th’Jewel House 1258 ,</p>
<p>And one already of the Privy Council.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN He will deserve more.</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN Yes, without all doubt.</p>
<p>Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way,</p>
<p>Which is to th’court, and there ye shall be my guests:</p>
<p>Something I can command 1259 . As I walk thither,</p>
<p>I’ll tell ye more.</p>
<p>FIRST and SECOND GENTLEMEN You may command us, sir.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
