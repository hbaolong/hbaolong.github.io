<h4 id="introduction-to-the-tragedy-of-cymbeline">Introduction to The
Tragedy of Cymbeline</h4>
<p>Many commentators have observed how fitting it is that The Tempest is
printed at the beginning of the First Folio of Shakespeare’s plays. Its
reflections on art, together with the resemblance of Prospero to a
dramatist and his island to a theatre, where a play is staged within the
play by actors who are spirits, make it seem like a Shakespearean
showpiece, a summation of his art. Far fewer commentators have
considered how equally appropriate it is that Cymbeline is printed at
the end of the First Folio. Though entitled The Tragedy of Cymbeline ,
it ends not with multiple deaths but with family reunion and political
reconciliation. ‘Pardon’s the word to all’ as revelations pile in upon
one another, each of them ‘a mark of wonder’, while a nation is restored
to peace: the play could equally well have been classed as a comedy or a
British history. The stylistic experimentation almost serves as an
ironic epilogue to the Folio’s tripartite division into comedies,
histories and tragedies: tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, Cymbeline
would have been Polonius’ favourite work in the canon. Furthermore, in a
manner analogous to the wittily extreme variations on classical motifs
in Baroque art, both the narrative arc and the characterization revisit
and revise, in a highly self-conscious manner, an array of favourite
Shakespearean motifs: the cross-dressed heroine, the move from court to
country, obsessive sexual jealousy, malicious machiavellian plotting,
the interrogation of Roman values.</p>
<p>For Shakespeare, the material provided the opportunity to reach back
to some of his earliest work. As in Titus Andronicus , a copy of Ovid’s
Metamorphoses is brought on stage as a prop. It is Innogen’s bedtime
reading: ‘She hath been reading late, / The tale of Tereus. Here the
leaf’s turned down / Where Philomel gave up.’ The allusion marks the
moment at which Innogen is betrayed. But whereas in Titus Lavinia’s
quoting of Philomel’s tragic tale is the means to the revelation of her
own rape, Iachimo can destroy Innogen’s reputation simply by looking at
her. His removal of the bracelet from her arm is a symbolic violation of
her chastity. In Shakespeare’s other rape story, the poem of Lucrece ,
Tarquin presses violently down on his victim’s breasts, but here Iachimo
merely watches and reports, noting in particular an identifying mole on
her left breast. It is the eyes of a spectator that do the undressing
here, not the tearing hands of a Tarquin. When Iachimo himself alludes
to the rapacious emperor – ‘Our’ Tarquin, a fellow-Roman – he rewrites
the night scene of Lucrece in a lyrical mode: ‘Our Tarquin thus / Did
softly press the rushes, ere he wakened / The chastity he wounded.’ The
sibilance seems tender rather than sinister: ‘Softly press’ suggests not
only stealth, but also a lover’s touch. And ‘wounded’ grossly
understates the severity of Tarquin’s deed. This has the effect of
sublimating the image of rape –Philomel gives up as in a dream, not in
brutal reality as on the stage of Titus , thus making it easier for the
audience to put itself in the position of Iachimo. To note and to wonder
at the beauty of the sleeping Innogen does not seem to do any harm. Yet
‘yellow Iachimo’ does work harm, and it takes all the play’s twists and
turns, including an apparent death and an actual physical violation when
Posthumus strikes Fidele/Innogen, to undo that harm.</p>
<p>The audience, then, is forced to confront its own complicity in
Iachimo’s deed. His gaze is ours. Shakespeare makes the point by means
of the chimney-piece in the bedroom. Whilst in the room, Iachimo records
‘the contents o’th’story’. In his subsequent narration to Posthumus he
reveals them:</p>
<p>The chimney</p>
<p>Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece</p>
<p>Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures</p>
<p>So likely to report themselves; the cutter</p>
<p>Was as another nature dumb, outwent her,</p>
<p>Motion and breath left out.</p>
<p>The gaze is fixed on the naked Diana bathing: Iachimo and with him
the audience stand in the position occupied in Ovidian mythology by the
hunter Actaeon, who is metamorphosed into a stag and torn to pieces by
his own hounds as punishment for his desiring gaze upon the goddess of
chastity. Shakespeare uses this reference to introduce the motif of
self-destructive sexual desire. The poetry almost makes us forget that
we never saw the chimney-piece: what we witnessed was the sleeping
figure of Innogen, as mediated through the language of Iachimo’s
gorgeous but prurient soliloquy.</p>
<p>The art of the chimney-piece, like that of Hermione’s statue in The
Winter’s Tale , is said to have outdone nature. A few lines earlier,
Iachimo has reported that the tapestry in the chamber told the story of
Mark Antony meeting Cleopatra at Cydnus; here Shakespeare echoes back
his own recent play in which Enobarbus describes Cleopatra at Cydnus as
being so desirable that’but for vacancy’ the air would have joined the
people of the city in going to gaze on her. The fictive chimney-piece
recapitulates and goes beyond this: the artist’s figures seem on the
verge of speech and movement, they are ‘likely to report themselves’ and
though they are ‘dumb’ they seem to make nature seem dumber. The air has
vacated nature and entered the artwork. When we associate Diana with
Innogen, the goddess seems to step down from the chimney-piece and
become embodied on stage in the form of a lovely boy-actor. The image
effects in the audience’s mind what The Winter’s Tale feigns to deliver
in performance: the metamorphosis of art into life. This is late
Shakespeare at his most sophisticated and self-consciously
inventive.</p>
<p>An eyewitness account of a performance of the play in 1611 makes much
of the scene in which Iachimo emerges from the trunk. Watching for the
plot, what Dr Simon Forman remembered most vividly was Innogen’s
bedchamber:</p>
<p>Remember also the story of Cymbeline king of England, in Lucius’
time, how Lucius came from Octavius Caesar for tribute, and being
denied, after sent Lucius with a great army of soldiers who landed at
Milford Haven, and after were vanquished by Cymbeline, and Lucius taken
prisoner, and all by means of 3 outlaws, of the which 2 of them were the
sons of Cymbeline, stolen from him when they were but 2 years old by an
old man whom Cymbeline banished, and he kept them as his own sons 20
years with him in a cave. And how [one] of them slew Cloten, that was
the queen’s son, going to Milford Haven to seek the love of Innogen the
king’s daughter, whom he had banished also for loving his daughter, and
how the Italian that came from her love conveyed himself into a chest,
and said it was a chest of plate sent from her love and others, to be
presented to the king. And in the deepest of the night, she being
asleep, he opened the chest, and came forth of it, and viewed her in her
bed, and the marks of her body, and took away her bracelet, and after
accused her of adultery to her love, etc. And in the end how he came
with the Romans into England and was taken prisoner, and after revealed
to Innogen, who had turned herself into man’s apparel and fled to meet
her love at Milford Haven, and chanced to fall on the cave in the woods
where her 2 brothers were, and how by eating a sleeping dram they
thought she had been dead, and laid her in the woods, and the body of
Cloten by her, in her love’s apparel that he left behind him, and how
she was found by Lucius, etc. (‘Book of Plays’, spelling modernized)</p>
<p>Forman’s report reveals how much detail an attentive spectator could
grasp in a complex Shakespearean drama – though he does seem to have
momentarily muddled Cloten and Posthumus, just as Innogen/Fidele does.
The account also suggests that Shakespearean playgoers worried little
about the plot’s dependence on frequent coincidences. Strikingly,
though, this spectator’s enthusiasm peters out towards the end: the
closing reunions and the descent of Jupiter in Posthumus’ dream do not
merit a mention. The long and outlandish final scene is extremely
difficult to stage effectively: it has sometimes been played as parody,
is often heavily cut, and has even been comprehensively rewritten (by
George Bernard Shaw).</p>
<p>In the movement of the action from court to country, Cymbeline has a
similar structure to the more popular and better-known Winter’s Tale .
The two plays were probably written within a year of each other. The
similarities are abundant. A man is falsely led to believe in his wife’s
infidelity, with the result that his powers of reasoning are distorted
and his language collapses into crabbed, dense invective against female
wiles:</p>
<p>… for there’s no motion</p>
<p>That tends to vice in man, but I affirm</p>
<p>It is the woman’s part: be it lying, note it,</p>
<p>The woman’s: flattering, hers: deceiving, hers:</p>
<p>Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers: revenges, hers:</p>
<p>Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,</p>
<p>Nice longing, slanders, mutability,</p>
<p>All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,</p>
<p>Why, hers, in part or all …</p>
<p>In fact, throughout Shakespeare’s works, most of these vices and
faults are to be found in the men’s parts, not the women’s. It is the
woman – Marina, Perdita, Innogen – who restores harmony.</p>
<p>In Cymbeline , as in The Winter’s Tale , she does so in combination
with the forces of nature. The febrile air of court intrigue is cleared
when we move outdoors and encounter princes disguised as shepherds. It
is perhaps in Cymbeline that Shakespeare’s art of natural observation is
at its most acute. The supposedly dead Fidele is apostrophized with the
phrase ‘the azured harebell, like thy veins’. The colour and structure
of the harebell do precisely resemble those of human veins. The
association of Innogen with nature goes back to the bedroom scene. The
key token of recognition, the mole on her breast, is ‘cinque-spotted:
like the crimson drops / I’th’bottom of a cowslip.’ Is there any other
English poet save the country labourer John Clare who could have created
such a simile, who has such an eye as acute as Shakespeare’s for the
intricacies of natural history and the apt metaphorical application of
them to human encounters?</p>
<p>As well as being a pastoral fantasy and a fairy story, complete with
wicked stepmother and poison (which, thanks to an honest-hearted
physician, turns out to be mere sleeping potion), this is a play about
the Romans in Britain, under the auspices of the god Jupiter. The title
in the Folio contents list is ‘Cymbeline King of Britain’. Shakespeare’s
other King of Britain was Lear, who made the mistake of dividing his
kingdom in three. Cymbeline may have been placed among the tragedies by
the editors of the Folio because it traverses the same elevated ground
of national history and destiny. But whereas the disarray of the divided
nation in King Lear is a negative example, perhaps intended to make the
play’s original audience feel relief that King James had recently united
the thrones of Scotland and England, the resolution of Cymbeline is
altogether positive: ‘Never was a war did cease, / Ere bloody hands were
washed, with such a peace.’</p>
<p>Cymbeline was supposed to have been King of Britain in the year when
Christ was born; at that time, the Roman emperor was Augustus.
Shakespeare’s audience would have known that Augustus was the Caesar to
whom Cymbeline agrees to pay tribute money, despite the miraculous
victory of the British when Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus (otherwise
known as Morgan, Polydore and Cadwal) hold the road against apparently
insurmountable odds. The end of the play heralds an ‘Augustan peace’, in
which Britain is imagined as the equal of Rome. Milford Haven in Wales
is a vital location and point of reference in the play. The more
historically and politically literate members of Shakespeare’s original
audience would have recalled that it was the port where Henry Tudor –
the Richmond of Richard III and the future King Henry VII – landed in
1485, the year that brought the Wars of the Roses to an end and
established the Tudor dynasty that turned the tables on modern Rome and
began to establish an image of their nation as the divinely chosen
Christian successor-empire to that of Augustus.</p>
<p>Imagine King James watching the play: he would have seen himself as a
composite version of Cymbeline and Augustus, both a British king and a
neo-Roman emperor. From the point of view of characterization, the part
of King Cymbeline is astonishingly under-written. His interior life is
never opened to us, as is that of Lear or, in this play, Princess
Innogen. All he seems to do in the long closing scene is ask questions,
express amazement and pronounce benediction. This makes sense if he is
intended to offer an oblique representation of James, King of Britain.
It would not do to inquire too closely into the monarch’s interior life.
Instead, Cymbeline is the ideal spectator: during a court performance,
the king would have been sitting at the focal point of the hall. In a
production that works, his amazement, his questions and his acceptance
are also ours.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Cymbeline, King of Britain when Augustus Caesar was Emperor of
Rome, has a daughter, Innogen, and two sons who were stolen in infancy.
The queen, his second wife, has a son, Cloten, whom Cymbeline wishes
Innogen to marry; but she has secretly married a commoner, Posthumus
Leonatus. Cymbeline banishes Posthumus to Rome, where he meets Iachimo,
who wagers with him that he can seduce Innogen. Arriving in Britain,
Iachimo realizes that she is incorruptible, but, hiding in her bedroom,
obtains evidence which convinces Posthumus that he has won the wager.
Posthumus orders his servant Pisanio to kill Innogen at Milford Haven,
but instead Pisanio advises her to disguise herself as Fidele, a page;
in Wales, she meets her brothers, who were stolen twenty years before by
the banished nobleman Belarius. Cloten pursues Innogen to Wales in
Posthumus’ clothes, determined to rape her and kill Posthumus. Instead,
he is killed by one of her brothers, and his decapitated body laid
beside Innogen, who has taken a potion that makes her appear dead. When
she revives, Innogen / Fidele joins the Roman army, which is invading
Britain as a result of Cymbeline’s failure to pay tribute to Rome.
Posthumus and the stolen princes are instrumental in defeating the Roman
army. A final scene of explanations leads to private and public
reconciliation.</p>

(1％/20/3), Philario (1％/14/2).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 85％ verse, 15％ prose.</p>
<p>DATE: 1610. Simon Forman attended a performance in April 1611;
composition apparently post-dates Beaumont and Fletcher’s Philaster
(1608–10); probably belongs to the months when the theatres were
reopened in spring 1610 after a long period of closure due to the
plague; the emphasis on Wales may suggest composition around the time of
the investiture of Henry as Prince of Wales in June 1610; perhaps
performed at court during the winter of 1610–11.</p>
<p>SOURCES: The plot involving Cymbeline, Guiderius, Arviragus and the
Romans in Britain is derived from a rudimentary outline in Holinshed’s
Chronicles (1587 edition); the heroic defence of the lane in the battle
is imported from elsewhere in Holinshed. The story of the wager on a
virtuous wife’s chastity goes back to Giovanni Boccaccio’s Decameron
(2nd Day, 9th novel) via an anonymous prose romance, Frederyke of Jennen
(1560 edition). The idea of combining pseudo-history with romance may
have been inspired by Beaumont and Fletcher’s recent play Philaster , a
pioneering work of Jacobean tragi-comedy with a girl disguised as a boy,
a mischief-making older woman, a virtuous lady accused of an illicit
sexual liaison, a contrast between a noble hero and an ignoble prince,
the forbidden marriage of a princess to a commoner, a movement from
court to country, and elements of masque-form. Some scholars, however,
propose that Cymbeline influenced Philaster rather than vice versa.</p>
<p>TEXT: First Folio of 1623 is the only text. Probably set from a
transcript by Ralph Crane, scribe to the King’s Men. Fairly well-printed
text, though some correction required, especially in those parts of the
play that were typeset by ‘Compositor E’, the least competent man in the
printing house. The heroine is called ‘Innogen’ in both Holinshed’s
Chronicles and Simon Forman’s notes on seeing the play; this name also
appears in Much Ado about Nothing (as well as in works by contemporaries
such as Thomas Heywood and Michael Drayton). ‘Imogen’ did not exist as a
name at this time and, besides, the heroines of Shakespeare’s late plays
are given symbolic names(Marina = from the sea; Perdita = the lost one;
Miranda = cause for admiration; hence Innogen = innocent one). All this
very strongly suggests that Folio’s ‘Imogen’ was a minim scribal or
compositorial error for ‘Innogen’, so we have corrected accordingly.</p>
