<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-8">Scene 1 ／ running scene 8</h4>
<p>Enter Duke [disguised ], Claudio and Provost</p>
<p>DUKE So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO The miserable have no other medicine</p>
<p>But only hope:</p>
<p>I’ve hope to live, and am prepared to die.</p>
<p>DUKE Be absolute 695 for death: either death or life</p>
<p>Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:</p>
<p>If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</p>
<p>That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,</p>
<p>Servile 696 to all the skyey influences 697</p>
<p>That dost this habitation 698 where thou keep’st 699</p>
<p>Hourly afflict. Merely 700 , thou art death’s fool 701 ,</p>
<p>For him thou labour’st by thy flight to shun,</p>
<p>And yet runn’st toward him still 702 . Thou art not noble,</p>
<p>For all th’accommodations 703 that thou bear’st</p>
<p>Are nursed by baseness 704 . Thou’rt by no means valiant,</p>
<p>For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork 705</p>
<p>Of a poor worm 706 . Thy best of rest 707 is sleep,</p>
<p>And that thou oft provok’st 708 , yet grossly 709 fear’st</p>
<p>Thy death, which is no more 710 . Thou art not thyself,</p>
<p>For thou exists on many a thousand grains</p>
<p>That issue out of dust 711 . Happy thou art not,</p>
<p>For what thou hast not, still thou striv’st to get,</p>
<p>And what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain 712 ,</p>
<p>For thy complexion 713 shifts to strange 714 effects</p>
<p>After 715 the moon. If thou art rich, thou’rt poor,</p>
<p>For like an ass, whose back with ingots 716 bows,</p>
<p>Thou bear’st thy heavy riches but a journey,</p>
<p>And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none,</p>
<p>For thine own bowels 717 which do call thee sire 718 ,</p>
<p>The mere effusion 719 of thy proper 720 loins,</p>
<p>Do curse the gout, serpigo 721 and the rheum 722</p>
<p>For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor 723 youth, nor age,</p>
<p>But as it were an after-dinner’s 724 sleep</p>
<p>Dreaming on both, for all thy blessèd youth</p>
<p>Becomes as agèd 725 , and doth beg the alms</p>
<p>Of 726 palsied eld 727 . And when thou art old and rich,</p>
<p>Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb 728 , nor beauty</p>
<p>To make thy riches pleasant. What’s yet in this</p>
<p>That bears the name of 729 life? Yet in this life</p>
<p>Lie hid more thousand deaths; yet death we fear,</p>
<p>That makes these odds all even 730 .</p>
<p>CLAUDIO I humbly thank you.</p>
<p>To sue 731 to live, I find I seek to die,</p>
<p>And, seeking death, find life. Let it 732 come on.</p>
<p>ISABELLA What, ho! Peace here, grace and good company.</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>PROVOST Who’s there? Come in. The wish 733 deserves a welcome.</p>
<p>DUKE Dear sir, ere long I’ll visit you again.</p>
<p>To Claudio</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Most holy sir, I thank you.</p>
<p>Enter Isabella</p>
<p>ISABELLA My business is a word or two with Claudio.</p>
<p>PROVOST And very welcome. Look, signior, here’s your sister.</p>
<p>DUKE Provost, a word with you.</p>
<p>Duke and Provost talk apart</p>
<p>PROVOST As many as you please.</p>
<p>DUKE Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.</p>
<p>Provost and Duke withdraw and hide themselves</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Now, sister, what’s the comfort?</p>
<p>Provost may exit</p>
<p>ISABELLA Why,</p>
<p>As all comforts are: most good, most good indeed.</p>
<p>Lord Angelo, having affairs to 734 heaven,</p>
<p>Intends you for his swift ambassador,</p>
<p>Where you shall be an everlasting leiger 735 ;</p>
<p>Therefore your best appointment 736 make with speed,</p>
<p>Tomorrow you set on 737 .</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Is there no remedy?</p>
<p>ISABELLA None, but such remedy as, to save a head,</p>
<p>To cleave 738 a heart in twain 739 .</p>
<p>CLAUDIO But is there any?</p>
<p>ISABELLA Yes, brother, you may live;</p>
<p>There is a devilish mercy in the judge,</p>
<p>If you’ll implore it, that will free your life,</p>
<p>But fetter 740 you till death.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Perpetual durance 741 ?</p>
<p>ISABELLA Ay, just 742 , perpetual durance, a restraint,</p>
<p>Though all the world’s vastidity 743 you had 744 ,</p>
<p>To a determined scope 745 .</p>
<p>CLAUDIO But in what nature 746 ?</p>
<p>ISABELLA In such a one as, you consenting to’t,</p>
<p>Would bark 747 your honour from that trunk 748 you bear,</p>
<p>And leave you naked.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Let me know the point.</p>
<p>ISABELLA O, I do fear thee, Claudio, and I quake,</p>
<p>Lest thou a feverous 749 life shouldst entertain 750 ,</p>
<p>And six or seven winters more respect 751</p>
<p>Than a perpetual honour. Dar’st thou die?</p>
<p>The sense 752 of death is most in apprehension 753 ,</p>
<p>And the poor beetle that we tread upon</p>
<p>In corporal sufferance 754 finds a pang as great</p>
<p>As when a giant dies.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Why give you me this shame? 755</p>
<p>Think you I can a resolution 756 fetch 757</p>
<p>From flow’ry tenderness 758 ? If I must die,</p>
<p>I will encounter 759 darkness as a bride,</p>
<p>And hug it in mine arms.</p>
<p>ISABELLA There spake my brother: there my father’s grave</p>
<p>Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die.</p>
<p>Thou art too noble to conserve a life</p>
<p>In base appliances 760 . This outward-sainted 761 deputy,</p>
<p>Whose settled visage 762 and deliberate 763 word</p>
<p>Nips youth i’th’head 764 and follies doth enew 765</p>
<p>As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil:</p>
<p>His filth within being cast 766 , he would appear</p>
<p>A pond as deep as hell.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO The prenzie 767 Angelo?</p>
<p>ISABELLA O, ’tis the cunning livery of hell,</p>
<p>The damned’st body to invest 768 and cover</p>
<p>In prenzie guards 769 ! Dost thou think 770 , Claudio,</p>
<p>If I would yield him my virginity</p>
<p>Thou mightst be freed?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO O heavens, it cannot be.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Yes, he would give’t thee, from this rank offence,</p>
<p>So to offend him still 771 . This night’s the time</p>
<p>That I should do what I abhor to name,</p>
<p>Or else thou diest tomorrow.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Thou shalt not do’t.</p>
<p>ISABELLA O, were it but my life,</p>
<p>I’d throw it down for your deliverance 772</p>
<p>As frankly 773 as a pin.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Thanks, dear Isabel.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Yes. Has he affections 774 in him,</p>
<p>That thus can make him bite the law by th’nose 775 ,</p>
<p>When he would force 776 it? Sure it is no sin,</p>
<p>Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Which is the least?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO If it were damnable, he being so wise,</p>
<p>Why would he for the momentary trick 777</p>
<p>Be perdurably fined 778 ? O Isabel!</p>
<p>ISABELLA What says my brother?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Death is a fearful thing.</p>
<p>ISABELLA And shamèd life a hateful.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Ay, but to die, and go we know not where,</p>
<p>To lie in cold obstruction 779 and to rot,</p>
<p>This sensible warm motion 780 to become</p>
<p>A kneaded clod 781 ; and the delighted 782 spirit</p>
<p>To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside</p>
<p>In thrilling 783 region 784 of thick-ribbèd 785 ice,</p>
<p>To be imprisoned in the viewless 786 winds,</p>
<p>And blown with restless violence round about</p>
<p>The pendent 787 world: or to be worse than worst</p>
<p>Of those that lawless and incertain 788 thought</p>
<p>Imagine howling — ’tis too horrible!</p>
<p>The weariest and most loathèd worldly life</p>
<p>That age, ache, penury 789 and imprisonment</p>
<p>Can lay on nature 790 is a paradise</p>
<p>To 791 what we fear of death.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Alas, alas!</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Sweet sister, let me live.</p>
<p>What sin you do to save a brother’s life,</p>
<p>Nature 792 dispenses 793 with the deed so far</p>
<p>That it becomes a virtue.</p>
<p>ISABELLA O you beast 794 !</p>
<p>O faithless coward! O dishonest 795 wretch!</p>
<p>Wilt thou be made a man 796 out of my vice?</p>
<p>Is’t not a kind of incest to take life</p>
<p>From thine own sister’s shame? What should I think?</p>
<p>Heaven shield 797 my mother played my father fair 798 ,</p>
<p>For such a warpèd slip of wilderness 799</p>
<p>Ne’er issued from his blood. Take my defiance 800 !</p>
<p>Die, perish! Might but 801 my bending down 802</p>
<p>Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed.</p>
<p>I’ll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,</p>
<p>No word to save thee.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Nay, hear me, Isabel.</p>
<p>ISABELLA O, fie, fie, fie!</p>
<p>Thy sin’s not accidental 803 , but a trade 804 .</p>
<p>Mercy to thee would prove itself 805 a bawd,</p>
<p>’Tis best that thou diest quickly.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO O, hear me, Isabella!</p>
<p>The Duke comes forward</p>
<p>DUKE Vouchsafe 806 a word, young sister, but one word.</p>
<p>ISABELLA What is your will?</p>
<p>DUKE Might you dispense with your leisure 807 , I would by and by 808
have some speech with you: the satisfaction 809 I would require is
likewise your own benefit 810 .</p>
<p>ISABELLA I have no superfluous leisure, my stay must be stolen out of
other affairs, but I will attend 811 you awhile.</p>
<p>She walks apart</p>
<p>DUKE Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you and your
sister. Angelo had never the purpose 812 to corrupt her; only he hath
made an assay 813 of her virtue to practise his judgement with the
disposition of natures 814 . She, having the truth of honour in her,
hath made him that gracious 815 denial which he is most glad to 816
receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true. Therefore
prepare yourself to death: do not satisfy your resolution 817 with hopes
that are fallible. Tomorrow you must die, go to your knees and make
ready.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life
that I will sue to be rid of it.</p>
<p>DUKE Hold you there 818 . Farewell.</p>
<p>[Exit Claudio ]</p>
<p>Provost, a word with you.</p>
<p>Provost enters or comes forward</p>
<p>PROVOST What’s your will, father?</p>
<p>DUKE That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me awhile with
the maid. My mind promises with my habit 819 no loss shall touch 820 her
by my company.</p>
<p>PROVOST In good time.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Isabella comes forward</p>
<p>DUKE The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good: the
goodness 821 that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness; but
grace 822 , being the soul of your complexion 823 , shall keep the body
of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you, fortune hath
conveyed to my understanding; and, but that frailty hath examples for
his falling 824 , I should wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content
this substitute 825 , and to save your brother?</p>
<p>ISABELLA I am now going to resolve 826 him. I had rather my brother
die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born. But, O, how much
is the good duke deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can speak
to him, I will open my lips in vain, or discover his government 827
.</p>
<p>DUKE That shall not be much amiss. Yet, as the matter now stands, he
will avoid 828 your accusation: he made trial of you only. Therefore
fasten your ear on my advisings 829 : to the love I have in doing good a
remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe 830 that you may most
uprighteously 831 do a poor wronged lady a merited 832 benefit, redeem
your brother from the angry law, do no stain to your own gracious
person, and much please the absent duke, if peradventure 833 he shall
ever return to have hearing of this business.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Let me hear you speak further. I have spirit 834 to do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit 835 .</p>
<p>DUKE Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not heard
speak of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great soldier who
miscarried 836 at sea?</p>
<p>ISABELLA I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her
name.</p>
<p>DUKE She should this Angelo have married, was affianced 837 to her by
oath, and the nuptial appointed 838 : between which time of the contract
839 and limit of the solemnity 840 , her brother Frederick was wrecked
at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister. But mark
how heavily 841 this befell to 842 the poor gentlewoman: there she lost
a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most kind and
natural 843 : with him, the portion and sinew 844 of her fortune, her
marriage-dowry: with both, her combinate 845 husband, this well-seeming
Angelo.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?</p>
<p>DUKE Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his
comfort, swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries of
dishonour 846 : in few 847 , bestowed her on her own lamentation 848 ,
which she yet 849 wears for his sake: and he, a marble to her tears, is
washed with them, but relents not.</p>
<p>ISABELLA What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
the world? What corruption in this life that it will let this man live!
But how out of this can she avail 850 ?</p>
<p>DUKE It is a rupture that you may easily heal, and the cure of it not
only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in doing it.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Show me how, good father.</p>
<p>DUKE This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first
affection 851 : his unjust unkindness — that in all reason should have
quenched her love — hath, like an impediment in the current 852 , made
it more violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo, answer his requiring 853
with a plausible 854 obedience, agree with his demands to the point 855
. Only refer yourself to this advantage 856 : first, that your stay with
him may not be long, that the time may have all shadow and silence in
it, and the place answer to convenience 857 . This being granted in
course 858 , and now follows all: we shall advise this wronged maid to
stead up 859 your appointment, go in your place. If the encounter 860
acknowledge 861 itself hereafter, it may compel him to her recompense
862 ; and here, by this is your brother saved, your honour untainted,
the poor Mariana advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled 863 . The
maid will I frame 864 and make fit 865 for his attempt. If you think
well to carry 866 this as you may, the doubleness 867 of the benefit
defends the deceit from reproof 868 . What think you of it?</p>
<p>ISABELLA The image 869 of it gives me content already, and I trust it
will grow to a most prosperous perfection 870 .</p>
<p>DUKE It lies much in your holding up 871 . Haste you speedily to
Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him promise of
satisfaction. I will presently to Saint Luke’s, there at the moated
grange 872 resides this dejected Mariana. At that place call upon me,
and dispatch 873 with Angelo, that it may be quickly.</p>
<p>ISABELLA I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good
father.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Elbow [and ] Officers [with Pompey, the ] Clown</p>
<p>ELBOW Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will needs buy
and sell men and women like beasts, we shall have all the world drink
brown and white bastard 874 .</p>
<p>DUKE O heavens, what stuff 875 is here?</p>
<p>POMPEY ’Twas never merry world since 876 of two usuries 877 the
merriest 878 was put down, and the worser allowed by order of law a
furred gown to keep him warm; and furred with fox 879 and lamb-skins
too, to signify that craft 880 , being richer than innocency, stands for
the facing 881 .</p>
<p>ELBOW Come your way, sir. Bless you, good father friar.</p>
<p>DUKE And you, good brother father 882 . What offence hath this man
made you, sir?</p>
<p>ELBOW Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him to
be a thief too, sir, for we have found upon him, sir, a strange picklock
883 , which we have sent to the deputy.</p>
<p>DUKE Fie, sirrah 884 , a bawd, a wicked bawd!</p>
<p>The evil that thou causest to be done,</p>
<p>That is thy means to live. Do thou but think</p>
<p>What ’tis to cram a maw 885 or clothe a back</p>
<p>From such a filthy vice. Say to thyself,</p>
<p>From their abominable and beastly touches</p>
<p>I drink, I eat, array 886 myself, and live.</p>
<p>Canst thou believe thy living is a life,</p>
<p>So stinkingly depending 887 ? Go mend 888 , go mend.</p>
<p>POMPEY Indeed, it does stink in some sort 889 , sir, but yet, sir, I
would prove—</p>
<p>DUKE Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs 890 for sin,</p>
<p>Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:</p>
<p>Correction 891 and instruction must both work</p>
<p>Ere this rude 892 beast will profit.</p>
<p>ELBOW He must before 893 the deputy, sir, he has given him warning.
The deputy cannot abide a whoremaster. If he be a whoremonger, and comes
before him, he were as good go a mile on his errand 894 .</p>
<p>DUKE That 895 we were all, as some would seem to be,</p>
<p>Free from our faults, as faults from seeming free 896 !</p>
<p>Enter Lucio</p>
<p>ELBOW His neck will come to 897 your waist — a cord 898 , sir.</p>
<p>POMPEY I spy comfort, I cry 899 bail. Here’s a gentleman and a friend
of mine.</p>
<p>LUCIO How now, noble Pompey? What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art thou
led in triumph 900 ? What, is there none of Pygmalion 901 ’s images,
newly made woman, to be had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and
extracting clutched 902 ? What reply, ha? What sayest thou to this tune,
matter and method? Is’t not drowned i’th’last rain 903 , ha? What sayest
thou, Trot 904 ? Is the world as it was, man? Which is the way 905 ? Is
it sad, and few words 906 ? Or how? The trick 907 of it?</p>
<p>DUKE Still thus, and thus 908 , still worse!</p>
<p>LUCIO How doth my dear morsel 909 , thy mistress? Procures she still,
ha?</p>
<p>POMPEY Troth 910 , sir, she hath eaten up all her beef 911 , and she
is herself in the tub 912 .</p>
<p>LUCIO Why, ’tis good: it is the right of it 913 , it must be so. Ever
your fresh whore and your powdered 914 bawd, an unshunned 915
consequence, it must be so. Art going to prison, Pompey?</p>
<p>POMPEY Yes, faith, sir.</p>
<p>LUCIO Why, ’tis not amiss 916 , Pompey. Farewell: go, say I sent thee
thither. For debt, Pompey? Or how?</p>
<p>ELBOW For being a bawd, for being a bawd.</p>
<p>LUCIO Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due 917 of a
bawd, why, ’tis his right. Bawd is he doubtless, and of antiquity 918
too, bawd-born 919 . Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
Pompey: you will turn good husband 920 now, Pompey, you will keep the
house.</p>
<p>POMPEY I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.</p>
<p>LUCIO No, indeed, will I not, Pompey, it is not the wear 921 . I will
pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage 922 . If you take it not
patiently, why, your mettle 923 is the more. Adieu, trusty Pompey.—
Bless you, friar.</p>
<p>DUKE And you.</p>
<p>LUCIO Does Bridget paint 924 still, Pompey, ha?</p>
<p>ELBOW Come your ways, sir, come.</p>
<p>POMPEY You will not bail me, then, sir?</p>
<p>To Lucio</p>
<p>LUCIO Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad 925 , friar? What
news?</p>
<p>ELBOW Come your ways, sir, come.</p>
<p>LUCIO Go to kennel 926 , Pompey, go.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Elbow, Pompey and Officers ]</p>
<p>What news, friar, of the duke?</p>
<p>DUKE I know none. Can you tell me of any?</p>
<p>LUCIO Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia. Other some 927 , he
is in Rome. But where is he, think you?</p>
<p>DUKE I know not where: but wheresoever, I wish him well.</p>
<p>LUCIO It was a mad fantastical trick 928 of him to steal 929 from the
state, and usurp the beggary 930 he was never born to. Lord Angelo dukes
it well in his absence: he puts 931 transgression to’t 932 .</p>
<p>DUKE He does well in’t.</p>
<p>LUCIO A little more lenity 933 to lechery would do no harm in him:
something too crabbed 934 that way, friar.</p>
<p>DUKE It is too general 935 a vice, and severity must cure it.</p>
<p>LUCIO Yes, in good sooth 936 , the vice is of a great kindred 937 ;
it is well allied 938 , but it is impossible to extirp 939 it quite,
friar, till eating and drinking be put down 940 . They say this Angelo
was not made by man and woman after this downright 941 way of creation.
Is it true, think you?</p>
<p>DUKE How should he be made, then?</p>
<p>LUCIO Some report a sea-maid 942 spawned him. Some, that he was begot
between two stock-fishes 943 . But it is certain that when he makes
water 944 his urine is congealed ice, that I know to be true: and he is
a motion generative 945 , that’s infallible 946 .</p>
<p>DUKE You are pleasant 947 , sir, and speak apace 948 .</p>
<p>LUCIO Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion of
a codpiece 949 to take away the life of a man. Would the duke that is
absent have done this? Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting
950 a 951 hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a
thousand. He had some feeling 952 of the sport 953 , he knew the service
954 , and that instructed him to mercy.</p>
<p>DUKE I never heard the absent duke much detected for women 955 , he
was not inclined that way.</p>
<p>LUCIO O sir, you are deceived.</p>
<p>DUKE ’Tis not possible.</p>
<p>LUCIO Who, not the duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty 956 , and his use
957 was to put a ducat 958 in her clack-dish 959 ; the duke had
crotchets 960 in him. He would be drunk too, that let me inform you.</p>
<p>DUKE You do him wrong, surely.</p>
<p>LUCIO Sir, I was an inward 961 of his. A shy fellow was the duke, and
I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing 962 .</p>
<p>DUKE What, I prithee, might be the cause?</p>
<p>LUCIO No, pardon. ’Tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and
the lips: but this I can let you understand, the greater file of the
subject 963 held the duke to be wise.</p>
<p>DUKE Wise? Why, no question but he was.</p>
<p>LUCIO A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing 964 fellow.</p>
<p>DUKE Either this is the envy 965 in you, folly, or mistaking: the
very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed 966 must upon a
warranted need 967 give him a better proclamation 968 . Let him be but
testimonied 969 in his own bringings-forth 970 , and he shall appear to
the envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier: therefore you speak
unskilfully 971 , or, if your knowledge be more, it is much darkened in
your malice.</p>
<p>LUCIO Sir, I know him, and I love him.</p>
<p>DUKE Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer love
972 .</p>
<p>LUCIO Come, sir, I know what I know.</p>
<p>DUKE I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak.
But if ever the duke return — as our prayers are he may — let me desire
you to make your answer 973 before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
you have courage to maintain 974 it; I am bound to call upon you — and,
I pray you, your name?</p>
<p>LUCIO Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the duke.</p>
<p>DUKE He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.</p>
<p>LUCIO I fear you not.</p>
<p>DUKE O, you hope the duke will return no more, or you imagine me too
unhurtful an opposite 975 . But indeed I can do you little harm. You’ll
forswear 976 this again 977 ?</p>
<p>LUCIO I’ll be hanged first. Thou art deceived in me, friar. But no
more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die tomorrow or no?</p>
<p>DUKE Why should he die, sir?</p>
<p>LUCIO Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish 978 . I would the duke
we talk of were returned again. This ungenitured 979 agent 980 will
unpeople 981 the province with continency 982 . Sparrows must not build
in his house-eaves, because they are lecherous 983 . The duke yet would
have dark deeds 984 darkly answered 985 , he would never bring them to
light. Would he were returned! Marry, this Claudio is condemned for
untrussing 986 . Farewell, good friar. I prithee, pray for me. The duke,
I say to thee again, would eat mutton on Fridays 987 . He’s now past it,
yet and I say to thee, he would mouth with 988 a beggar, though she
smelt brown bread 989 and garlic. Say that I said so. Farewell.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>DUKE No might nor greatness in mortality</p>
<p>Can censure ’scape 990 . Back-wounding calumny</p>
<p>The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong</p>
<p>Can tie the gall 991 up in the sland’rous tongue?</p>
<p>But who comes here?</p>
<p>Enter Escalus, Provost and [Officers with ] Bawd [Mistress Overdone
]</p>
<p>ESCALUS Go, away with her to prison.</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE Good my lord, be good to me: your honour is
accounted a merciful man, good my lord.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in the same
kind? 992 This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant 993 .</p>
<p>PROVOST A bawd of eleven years’ continuance, may it please your
honour.</p>
<p>MISTRESS OVERDONE My lord, this is one Lucio’s information 994
against me. Mistress Kate Keepdown 995 was with child by him in the
duke’s time 996 , he promised her marriage. His child is a year and a
quarter old come Philip and Jacob 997 . I have kept it myself; and see
how he goes about to abuse me!</p>
<p>ESCALUS That fellow is a fellow of much licence 998 . Let him be
called before us. Away with her to prison. Go to, no more words.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Officers with Mistress Overdone ]</p>
<p>Provost, my brother 999 Angelo will not be altered: Claudio must die
tomorrow. Let him be furnished with divines 1000 , and have all
charitable preparation. If my brother wrought by my pity 1001 , it
should not be so with him.</p>
<p>PROVOST So please you, this friar hath been with him, and advised him
for th’entertainment 1002 of death.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Good even, good father.</p>
<p>DUKE Bliss and goodness on you!</p>
<p>ESCALUS Of whence are you 1003 ?</p>
<p>DUKE Not of this country, though my chance 1004 is now</p>
<p>To use it for my time 1005 . I am a brother</p>
<p>Of gracious order, late come from the See 1006</p>
<p>In special business from his holiness.</p>
<p>ESCALUS What news abroad 1007 i’th’world?</p>
<p>DUKE None, but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the
dissolution of it 1008 must cure it. Novelty is only in request 1009 ,
and it is as dangerous to be aged 1010 in any kind of course 1011 as it
is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth
enough alive to make societies 1012 secure, but security 1013 enough to
make fellowships 1014 accurst. Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of
the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every day’s news. I pray
you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?</p>
<p>ESCALUS One that, above all other strifes 1015 , contended especially
to know himself.</p>
<p>DUKE What pleasure 1016 was he given to?</p>
<p>ESCALUS Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at anything
which professed to make him rejoice. A gentleman of all temperance. But
leave we him to his events 1017 , with a prayer they may prove
prosperous, and let me desire to know how you find Claudio prepared. I
am made to understand that you have lent him visitation 1018 .</p>
<p>DUKE He professes to have received no sinister measure 1019 from his
judge, but most willingly humbles himself to the determination 1020 of
justice: yet had he framed to 1021 himself, by the instruction 1022 of
his frailty, many deceiving promises of life, which I by my good leisure
1023 have discredited 1024 to him, and now is he resolved to die.</p>
<p>ESCALUS You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner the
very debt of your calling 1025 . I have laboured for the poor gentleman
to the extremest shore of my modesty 1026 , but my brother justice have
I found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed
Justice 1027 .</p>
<p>DUKE If his own life answer the straitness 1028 of his proceeding, it
shall become him well: wherein if he chance to fail, he hath sentenced
himself.</p>
<p>ESCALUS I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.</p>
<p>DUKE Peace be with you.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Escalus and Provost ]</p>
<p>He who the sword of heaven 1029 will bear</p>
<p>Should be as holy as severe:</p>
<p>Pattern in himself to know 1030 ,</p>
<p>Grace to stand 1031 , and virtue go 1032 ,</p>
<p>More nor less to others paying</p>
<p>Than by self-offences weighing 1033 .</p>
<p>Shame to him whose cruel striking</p>
<p>Kills for faults of his own liking.</p>
<p>Twice treble shame on Angelo,</p>
<p>To weed 1034 my vice and let his grow!</p>
<p>O, what may man within him hide,</p>
<p>Though angel on the outward side!</p>
<p>How may likeness made in crimes 1035 ,</p>
<p>Making practice 1036 on the times,</p>
<p>To draw with idle spiders’ strings</p>
<p>Most pond’rous and substantial things 1037 !</p>
<p>Craft 1038 against vice I must apply.</p>
<p>With Angelo tonight shall lie</p>
<p>His old betrothèd 1039 but despised 1040 ,</p>
<p>So disguise 1041 shall, by th’disguised 1042 ,</p>
<p>Pay with falsehood false exacting 1043 ,</p>
<p>And perform an old contracting 1044 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
