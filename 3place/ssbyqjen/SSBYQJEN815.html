17</h4>
<p>Alarums. Matthew Gough is slain, and all the rest [of his followers
with him ]. Then enter Jack Cade, with his company [including Dick,
Smith and Holland ]</p>
<p>CADE So, sirs: now go some and pull down the Savoy 1308 : others to
the Inns of Court 1309 : down with them all.</p>
<p>DICK I have a suit unto your lordship 1310 .</p>
<p>CADE Be it a lordship, thou shalt have it for that word.</p>
<p>DICK Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth.</p>
<p>HOLLAND Mass, ’twill be sore law, then; for he was thrust in the
mouth with a spear, and ’tis not whole 1311 yet.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>SMITH Nay, John, it will be stinking law, for his breath stinks with
eating toasted cheese.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CADE I have thought upon it: it shall be so. Away, burn all the
records of the realm: my mouth shall be the Parliament of England.</p>
<p>HOLLAND Then we are like to have biting 1312 statutes, unless his
teeth be pulled out.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CADE And henceforward all things shall be in common.</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER My lord, a prize, a prize! Here’s the Lord Saye which sold
the towns 1313 in France. He that made us pay one and twenty fifteens
1314 , and one shilling to the pound, the last subsidy 1315 .</p>
<p>Enter George [Bevis ], with the Lord Saye</p>
<p>CADE Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times.— Ah, thou say 1316
, thou serge 1317 , nay, thou buckram 1318 lord! Now art thou within
point-blank 1319 of our jurisdiction regal. What canst thou answer to my
majesty for giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu 1320 , the
Dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these presence 1321 , even
the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I am the besom 1322 that must sweep
the court clean of such filth as thou art: thou hast most traitorously
corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar school: and
whereas before, our forefathers had no other books but the score and the
tally 1323 , thou hast caused printing to be used, and contrary to the
king, his crown, and dignity, thou hast built a paper-mill 1324 . It
will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually
1325 talk of a noun and a verb, and such abominable words as no
Christian ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed justices of peace,
to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer.
Moreover, thou hast put them in prison, and because they could not read,
thou hast hanged them, when, indeed, only for that cause they have been
most worthy to live 1326 . Thou dost ride on a foot-cloth 1327 , dost
thou not?</p>
<p>To Saye</p>
<p>SAYE What of that?</p>
<p>CADE Marry 1328 , thou ought’st not to let thy horse wear a cloak,
when honester men than thou go in their hose and doublets 1329 .</p>
<p>DICK And work in their shirt too, as myself, for example, that am a
butcher.</p>
<p>SAYE You men of Kent—</p>
<p>DICK What say you of Kent?</p>
<p>SAYE Nothing but this: ‘tis ’bona terra, mala gens’ 1330 .</p>
<p>CADE Away with him, away with him! He speaks Latin.</p>
<p>SAYE Hear me but speak, and bear 1331 me where you will:</p>
<p>Kent, in the commentaries Caesar writ 1332 ,</p>
<p>Is termed the civil’st place of this isle:</p>
<p>Sweet is the country, because full of riches:</p>
<p>The people liberal 1333 , valiant, active, wealthy:</p>
<p>Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.</p>
<p>I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy,</p>
<p>Yet to recover them would lose my life.</p>
<p>Justice with favour 1334 have I always done:</p>
<p>Prayers and tears have moved me, gifts could never.</p>
<p>When have I aught 1335 exacted 1336 at your hands,</p>
<p>Kent to maintain, the king, the realm and you?</p>
<p>Large gifts have I bestowed on learnèd clerks 1337 ,</p>
<p>Because my book 1338 preferred me 1339 to the king.</p>
<p>And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,</p>
<p>Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven.</p>
<p>Unless you be possessed with devilish spirits,</p>
<p>You cannot but forbear 1340 to murder me:</p>
<p>This tongue hath parleyed unto 1341 foreign kings</p>
<p>For your behoof 1342 —</p>
<p>CADE Tut, when struck’st thou one blow in the field 1343 ?</p>
<p>SAYE Great men have reaching 1344 hands: oft have I struck</p>
<p>Those that I never saw and struck them dead.</p>
<p>BEVIS O monstrous coward! What, to come behind 1345 folks?</p>
<p>SAYE These cheeks are pale for watching 1346 for your good.</p>
<p>CADE Give him a box o’th’ear and that will make ’em red again.</p>
<p>SAYE Long sitting 1347 to determine 1348 poor men’s causes 1349</p>
<p>Hath made me full of sickness and diseases.</p>
<p>CADE Ye shall have a hempen caudle 1350 1351 , then, and the help of
hatchet 1352 .</p>
<p>DICK Why dost thou quiver, man?</p>
<p>SAYE The palsy 1353 , and not fear, provokes me.</p>
<p>CADE Nay, he nods at us, as who 1354 should say, ‘I’ll be even 1355
with you.’ I’ll see if his</p>
<p>head will stand steadier on a pole, or no: take him away, and behead
him.</p>
<p>SAYE Tell me: wherein have I offended most?</p>
<p>Have I affected 1356 wealth or honour? Speak.</p>
<p>Are my chests filled up with extorted gold?</p>
<p>Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?</p>
<p>Whom have I injured, that ye seek my death?</p>
<p>These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding 1357 ,</p>
<p>This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.</p>
<p>O, let me live!</p>
<p>CADE I feel remorse 1358 in myself with his words: but I’ll bridle
1359 it: he shall die, an it be but 1360 for pleading so well for his
life.— Away with him: he has a familiar 1361 under his tongue: he speaks
not a 1362 God’s name. Go, take him away, I say, and strike off his head
presently, and then break into his son-in-law’s house, Sir James Cromer,
and strike off his head, and bring them both upon two poles hither.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Aloud</p>
<p>ALL It shall be done.</p>
<p>SAYE Ah, countrymen, if when you make your prayers,</p>
<p>God should be so obdurate 1363 as yourselves,</p>
<p>How would it fare with your departed souls?</p>
<p>And therefore yet relent, and save my life.</p>
<p>CADE Away with him, and do as I command ye.</p>
<p>Exeunt one or two with the Lord Saye</p>
<p>The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head on his
shoulders, unless he pay me tribute 1364 : there shall not a maid be
married, but she shall pay to me her maidenhead 1365 ere they have it
1366 : men shall hold 1367 of me in capite 1368 . And we charge and
command that their wives be as free 1369 as heart can wish or tongue can
tell.</p>
<p>DICK My lord, when shall we go to Cheapside and take up commodities
upon our bills 1370 1371 ?</p>
<p>CADE Marry, presently.</p>
<p>ALL O, brave 1372 !</p>
<p>Enter one with the heads [of Saye and Cromer on poles ]</p>
<p>CADE But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another, for they
loved well when hey were alive. Now part them again, lest they consult
about the giving up of some more towns in France. Soldiers, defer the
spoil 1373 of the city until night: for with these borne before us,
instead of maces 1374 , will we ride through the streets, and at every
corner have them kiss. Away</p>
<p>The heads are made to kiss</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
