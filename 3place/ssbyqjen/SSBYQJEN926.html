continues</h4>
<p>Enter three bawds [Pander, Bawd and Bolt ]</p>
<p>PANDER Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she had ne’er
come here 1106 .</p>
<p>BAWD Fie, fie upon her, she’s able to freeze the god Priapus 1107 and
undo a whole generation 1108 ! We must either get her ravished or be rid
of her. When she should do for clients her fitment 1109 , and do me the
kindness 1110 of our profession, she has me her quirks 1111 , her
reasons, her master 1112 reasons, her prayers, her knees, that she would
make a puritan 1113 of the devil if he should cheapen 1114 a kiss of
her.</p>
<p>BOLT Faith, I must ravish her, or she’ll disfurnis 1115 us of all our
cavalleria 1116 and make our swearers 1117 priests.</p>
<p>PANDER Now the pox upon her green-sickness 1118 for me 1119 .</p>
<p>BAWD Faith, there’s no way to be rid on’t 1120 but by the way to the
pox 1121 — here comes the lord Lysimachus disguised.</p>
<p>BOLT We should have both lord and loon 1122 , if the peevish 1123
baggage 1124 would but give way 1125 to customers.</p>
<p>Enter Lysimachus</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS How now, how 1126 a dozen of virginities?</p>
<p>BAWD Now the gods to bless 1127 your honour!</p>
<p>BOLT I am glad to see your honour in good health.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS You may, so: ’tis the better for you that your resorters
stand upon sound legs 1128 . How now? Wholesome iniquity 1129 have you,
that a man may deal withal 1130 and defy the surgeon?</p>
<p>BAWD We have here one, sir, if she would — but there never came her
like in Mytilene.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS If she’d do the deeds of darkness 1131 , thou wouldst
say.</p>
<p>BAWD Your honour knows what ’tis to say 1132 well enough.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Well, call forth, call forth.</p>
<p>[Exit Pander ]</p>
<p>BOLT For flesh 1133 and blood 1134 , sir, white and red 1135 , you
shall see a rose 1136 , and she were a rose indeed, if she had but—
1137</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS What, prithee?</p>
<p>BOLT O, sir, I can be modest 1138 .</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it gives
a good report to a number to be chaste 1139 .</p>
<p>[Enter Pander with Marina ]</p>
<p>BAWD Here comes that which grows to the stalk</p>
<p>— never plucked yet 1140 , I can assure you. Is she not a fair
creature?</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea 1141 .
Well, there’s for you. Leave us.</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>BAWD I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and I’ll have done
presently 1142 .</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS I beseech you, do.</p>
<p>BAWD First, I would have you note 1143 this is an honourable man.</p>
<p>To Marina</p>
<p>MARINA I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note 1144
him.</p>
<p>BAWD Next, he’s the governor of this country, and a man whom I am
bound 1145 to.</p>
<p>MARINA If he govern the country you are bound 1146 to him indeed, but
how honourable he is in that 1147 , I know not.</p>
<p>BAWD Pray you, without any more virginal fencing 1148 , will you use
him kindly 1149 ? He will line your apron with gold 1150 .</p>
<p>MARINA What he will do graciously 1151 , I will thankfully
receive.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Ha’ you done?</p>
<p>BAWD My lord, she’s not paced 1152 yet 1153 , you must take some
pains to work her to your manage 1154 1155 .—Come, we will leave his
honour and her together. Go thy ways 1156 .</p>
<p>To Bolt and Pander</p>
<p>[Exeunt Bawd, Bolt and Pander ]</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade 1157
?</p>
<p>MARINA What trade, sir?</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Why, I cannot name’t but I shall offend.</p>
<p>MARINA I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS How long have you been of this profession?</p>
<p>MARINA E’er since I can remember.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Did you go to’t 1158 so young? Were you a gamester 1159 at
five, or at seven?</p>
<p>MARINA Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a creature
of sale 1160 .</p>
<p>MARINA Do you know this house to be a place of such resort 1161 , and
will come into’t? I hear say you’re of honourable parts 1162 , and are
the governor of this place.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Why, hath your principal 1163 made known unto you who I
am?</p>
<p>MARINA Who is my principal?</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Why, your herb-woman 1164 , she that sets seeds and roots
of shame and iniquity 1165 . O, you have heard something of my power,
and so stand aloof for more serious wooing! But I protest to thee 1166 ,
pretty one, my authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly upon
thee. Come, bring me to some private place. Come, come.</p>
<p>MARINA If you were born to honour, show it now 1167 ,</p>
<p>If put upon you, make the judgement good</p>
<p>That thought you worthy of it 1168 .</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS How’s this? How’s this? Some more, be sage 1169 .</p>
<p>MARINA For me</p>
<p>That am a maid, though most ungentle fortune</p>
<p>Have placed me in this sty 1170 , where, since I came,</p>
<p>Diseases have been sold dearer than physic 1171 .</p>
<p>That the gods</p>
<p>Would set me free from this unhallowed place,</p>
<p>Though they did change me to the meanest 1172 bird</p>
<p>That flies i’th’purer air!</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS I did not think thou couldst have spoke so well,</p>
<p>Ne’er dreamt thou couldst!</p>
<p>Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,</p>
<p>Thy speech had altered it. Hold, here’s gold for thee:</p>
<p>Gives gold</p>
<p>Persevere in that clear 1173 way thou goest</p>
<p>And the gods strengthen thee!</p>
<p>MARINA The good gods preserve you.</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS For me be you thoughten 1174 , that I came</p>
<p>With no ill intent, for to me the very doors</p>
<p>And windows savour 1175 vilely. Fare thee well —</p>
<p>Thou art a piece of virtue 1176 , and I doubt not</p>
<p>But thy training 1177 hath been noble.</p>
<p>Hold, here’s more gold for thee.</p>
<p>Gives gold</p>
<p>A curse upon him, die he like a thief</p>
<p>That robs thee of thy goodness. If thou dost</p>
<p>Hear from me it shall be for thy good.</p>
<p>[Enter Bolt ]</p>
<p>BOLT I beseech your honour, one piece for me?</p>
<p>LYSIMACHUS Avaunt 1178 , thou damned doorkeeper 1179 !</p>
<p>Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it 1180 ,</p>
<p>Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>BOLT How’s this? We must take another course 1181 with you! If your
peevish 1182 chastity, which is not worth a breakfast in the cheapest
country under the cope 1183 , shall undo a whole household, let me be
gelded like a spaniel 1184 . Come your ways.</p>
<p>MARINA Whither would you have me? 1185</p>
<p>BOLT I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common hangman
shall execute it 1186 . Come your ways, we’ll have no more gentlemen
driven away. Come your ways, I say.</p>
<p>Enter bawds [Bawd and Pander ]</p>
<p>BAWD How now, what’s the matter?</p>
<p>BOLT Worse and worse, mistress. She has here spoken holy words to the
Lord Lysimachus.</p>
<p>BAWD O, abominable!</p>
<p>BOLT He makes our profession as it were to stink afore the face of
the gods.</p>
<p>BAWD Marry, hang her up for ever!</p>
<p>BOLT The nobleman 1187 would have dealt with her like a nobleman, and
she sent him away as cold as a snowball, saying his prayers, too.</p>
<p>BAWD Bolt, take her away, use her at thy pleasure: crack the glass of
her virginity 1188 and make the rest malleable.</p>
<p>BOLT An if 1189 she were a thornier piece of ground 1190 than she is,
she shall be ploughed 1191 .</p>
<p>MARINA Hark, hark you gods!</p>
<p>BAWD She conjures 1192 ! Away with her, would she had never come
within my doors. Marry, hang you! She’s born to undo us. Will you not go
the way of womankind? Marry, come up 1193 , my dish of chastity with
rosemary 1194 and bays 1195 !</p>
<p>[Exeunt Bawd and Pander ]</p>
<p>BOLT Come, mistress, come your way with me.</p>
<p>MARINA Whither wilt thou have me?</p>
<p>BOLT To take from you the jewel 1196 you hold so dear.</p>
<p>MARINA Prithee, tell me one thing 1197 first.</p>
<p>BOLT Come now, your one thing?</p>
<p>MARINA What canst thou wish thine enemy to be? 1198</p>
<p>BOLT Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather my
mistress.</p>
<p>MARINA Neither of these are so bad as thou art,</p>
<p>Since they do better thee in their command 1199 .</p>
<p>Thou hold’st a place 1200 for which the painèd’st 1201 fiend</p>
<p>Of hell would not in reputation change 1202 :</p>
<p>Thou art the damned doorkeeper 1203 to every</p>
<p>Coistrel 1204 that comes inquiring for his Tib 1205 .</p>
<p>To the choleric fisting of every rogue</p>
<p>Thy ear is liable 1206 , thy food is such</p>
<p>As hath been belched on by infected lungs 1207 .</p>
<p>BOLT What would you 1208 have me do? Go to the wars, would you? Where
a man may serve seven years for the loss of a leg 1209 , and have not
money enough in the end to buy him a wooden one?</p>
<p>MARINA Do anything but this thou dost. Empty</p>
<p>Old receptacles 1210 or common shores 1211 of filth,</p>
<p>Serve by indenture 1212 to the common hangman:</p>
<p>Any of these ways are yet better than this,</p>
<p>For what thou professest 1213 a baboon 1214 , could he speak,</p>
<p>Would own a name too dear 1215 . O, that the gods</p>
<p>Would safely deliver me from this place!</p>
<p>Here, here’s gold for thee. If that thy master would gain</p>
<p>Gives gold</p>
<p>By me, proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,</p>
<p>With other virtues 1216 which I’ll keep from boast,</p>
<p>And will undertake all these to teach.</p>
<p>I doubt not but this populous city will</p>
<p>Yield many scholars.</p>
<p>BOLT But can you teach all this you speak of?</p>
<p>MARINA Prove that I cannot, take me home again</p>
<p>And prostitute me to the basest groom 1217</p>
<p>That doth frequent your house.</p>
<p>BOLT Well, I will see what I can do for thee.</p>
<p>If I can place thee, I will.</p>
<p>MARINA But amongst honest 1218 women.</p>
<p>BOLT Faith, my acquaintance lies little 1219 amongst them. But since
my master and mistress hath bought you, there’s no going but by their
consent. Therefore I will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I
doubt not but I shall find them tractable 1220 enough. Come, I’ll do for
thee what I can. Come your ways 1221 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
<p>Chorus / running scene 20</p>
<p>Enter Gower</p>
<p>GOWER Marina thus the brothel scapes, and chances</p>
<p>Into an honest house, our story says.</p>
<p>She sings like one immortal, and she dances</p>
<p>As goddess-like 1222 to her admirèd lays 1223 .</p>
<p>Deep 1224 clerks 1225 she dumbs 1226 , and with her nee’le 1227
composes</p>
<p>Nature’s own shape of bud, bird, branch or berry,</p>
<p>That even her art sisters 1228 the natural roses,</p>
<p>Her inkle 1229 , silk 1230 , twin 1231 with the rubied 1232
cherry.</p>
<p>That pupils lacks she none of noble race,</p>
<p>Who pour their bounty on her, and her gain</p>
<p>She gives the cursèd bawd. Here we her place,</p>
<p>And to her father turn our thoughts again,</p>
<p>Where we left him on the sea.We there him lost,</p>
<p>Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived</p>
<p>Here where his daughter dwells, and on this coast</p>
<p>Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived</p>
<p>God Neptune’s annual feast to keep, from whence</p>
<p>Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,</p>
<p>His 1233 banners sable 1234 , trimmed with rich expense,</p>
<p>And to him in his barge with fervour hies 1235 .</p>
<p>In your supposing 1236 once more put your sight</p>
<p>Of heavy 1237 Pericles: think this his bark 1238 ,</p>
<p>Where what is done in action 1239 , more if might 1240 ,</p>
<p>Shall be discovered, please you sit and hark.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
