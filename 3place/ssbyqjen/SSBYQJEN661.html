14</h4>
<p>Enter Prince Henry, Salisbury and Bigot</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY It is too late: the life of all his blood</p>
<p>Is touched 1745 corruptibly 1746 , and his pure 1747 brain,</p>
<p>Which some suppose the soul’s frail dwelling-house,</p>
<p>Doth by the idle 1748 comments that it makes</p>
<p>Foretell the ending of mortality.</p>
<p>Enter Pembroke</p>
<p>PEMBROKE His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief</p>
<p>That, being brought into the open air,</p>
<p>It would allay the burning quality</p>
<p>Of that fell 1749 poison which assaileth him.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Let him be brought into the orchard 1750 here.</p>
<p>[Exit Bigot ]</p>
<p>Doth he still rage 1751 ?</p>
<p>PEMBROKE He is more patient</p>
<p>Than when you left him; even now he sung.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY O vanity 1752 of sickness! Fierce extremes</p>
<p>In their continuance will not feel themselves 1753 .</p>
<p>Death, having preyed upon the outward parts,</p>
<p>Leaves them invisible 1754 , and his siege is now</p>
<p>Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds</p>
<p>With many legions 1755 of strange fantasies,</p>
<p>Which, in their throng and press to that last hold 1756 ,</p>
<p>Confound 1757 themselves. ’Tis strange that death should sing.</p>
<p>I am the cygnet 1758 to this pale faint swan 1759 ,</p>
<p>Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,</p>
<p>And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings</p>
<p>His soul and body to their lasting rest.</p>
<p>SALISBURY Be of good comfort, Prince, for you are born</p>
<p>To set a form upon that indigest 1760</p>
<p>Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude 1761 .</p>
<p>King John [is ] brought in</p>
<p>KING JOHN Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room 1762 :</p>
<p>It would not out at windows nor at doors:</p>
<p>There is so hot a summer in my bosom</p>
<p>That all my bowels crumble up to dust:</p>
<p>I am a scribbled form 1763 , drawn with a pen</p>
<p>Upon a parchment, and against this fire</p>
<p>Do I shrink up.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY How fares your majesty?</p>
<p>KING JOHN Poisoned, ill fare 1764 : dead, forsook 1765 , cast
off:</p>
<p>And none of you will bid the winter come</p>
<p>To thrust his icy fingers in my maw 1766 ,</p>
<p>Nor let my kingdom’s rivers take their course</p>
<p>Through my burned bosom, nor entreat the north 1767</p>
<p>To make his bleak winds kiss my parchèd lips</p>
<p>And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,</p>
<p>I beg cold comfort 1768 : and you are so strait 1769</p>
<p>And so ingrateful 1770 , you deny me that.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY O that there were some virtue 1771 in my tears,</p>
<p>That might relieve you!</p>
<p>KING JOHN The salt in them is hot.</p>
<p>Within me is a hell, and there the poison</p>
<p>Is, as a fiend, confined to tyrannize</p>
<p>On unreprievable condemnèd blood.</p>
<p>Enter [the ] Bastard</p>
<p>BASTARD O, I am scalded with my violent motion 1772</p>
<p>And spleen 1773 of speed to see your majesty!</p>
<p>KING JOHN O cousin, thou art come to set 1774 mine eye:</p>
<p>The tackle 1775 of my heart is cracked and burnt,</p>
<p>And all the shrouds 1776 wherewith my life should sail</p>
<p>Are turnèd to one thread, one little hair:</p>
<p>My heart hath one poor string 1777 to stay 1778 it by,</p>
<p>Which holds but till thy news be utterèd:</p>
<p>And then all this thou see’st is but a clod 1779</p>
<p>And module 1780 of confounded 1781 royalty.</p>
<p>BASTARD The dauphin is preparing hitherward 1782 ,</p>
<p>Where heaven he 1783 knows how we shall answer him:</p>
<p>For in a night the best part of my power,</p>
<p>As I upon 1784 advantage did remove 1785 ,</p>
<p>Were in the Washes all unwarily</p>
<p>Devourèd by the unexpected flood 1786 .</p>
<p>King John dies</p>
<p>SALISBURY You breathe these dead 1787 news in as dead an ear.—</p>
<p>My liege, my lord!— But 1788 now a king, now thus 1789 .</p>
<p>To King John</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Even so 1790 must I run on, and even so stop.</p>
<p>What surety of the world, what hope, what stay 1791 ,</p>
<p>When this was now a king, and now is clay?</p>
<p>BASTARD Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind</p>
<p>To King John</p>
<p>To do the office for thee of revenge,</p>
<p>And then my soul shall wait on 1792 thee to heaven,</p>
<p>As it on earth hath been thy servant still 1793 .—</p>
<p>Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres 1794 ,</p>
<p>To the Lords</p>
<p>Where be your powers? Show now your mended faiths,</p>
<p>And instantly return with me again,</p>
<p>To push destruction and perpetual shame</p>
<p>Out of the weak door of our fainting land:</p>
<p>Straight 1795 let us seek, or straight we shall be sought:</p>
<p>The dauphin rages at our very heels.</p>
<p>SALISBURY It seems you know not, then, so much as we:</p>
<p>The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,</p>
<p>Who half an hour since came from the dauphin,</p>
<p>And brings from him such offers of our peace</p>
<p>As we with honour and respect 1796 may take,</p>
<p>With purpose presently 1797 to leave this war.</p>
<p>BASTARD He will the rather 1798 do it when he sees</p>
<p>Ourselves well sinewèd 1799 to our defence.</p>
<p>SALISBURY Nay, ’tis in a manner done already,</p>
<p>For many carriages 1800 he hath dispatched</p>
<p>To the seaside, and put his cause and quarrel</p>
<p>To the disposing 1801 of the cardinal,</p>
<p>With whom yourself, myself and other lords,</p>
<p>If you think meet 1802 , this afternoon will post 1803</p>
<p>To consummate 1804 this business happily.</p>
<p>BASTARD Let it be so.— And you, my noble prince,</p>
<p>With other princes 1805 that may best be spared,</p>
<p>Shall wait upon 1806 your father’s funeral.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY At Worcester must his body be interred;</p>
<p>For so he willed it.</p>
<p>BASTARD Thither shall it then,</p>
<p>And happily 1807 may your sweet self put on</p>
<p>The lineal state 1808 and glory of the land,</p>
<p>To whom with all submission, on my knee</p>
<p>I do bequeath 1809 my faithful services</p>
<p>And true subjection everlastingly.</p>
<p>He kneels</p>
<p>SALISBURY And the like tender 1810 of our love we make,</p>
<p>To rest 1811 without a spot 1812 for ever more.</p>
<p>The Lords kneel</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I have a kind soul that would give thanks</p>
<p>And knows not how to do it but with tears.</p>
<p>He weeps</p>
<p>BASTARD O, let us pay the time but 1813 needful woe 1814 ,</p>
<p>Rising</p>
<p>Since it hath been beforehand 1815 with our griefs.</p>
<p>This England never did, nor never shall,</p>
<p>Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,</p>
<p>But 1816 when it first did help to wound itself.</p>
<p>Now these her princes are come home again,</p>
<p>Come the three corners 1817 of the world in arms,</p>
<p>And we shall shock 1818 them. Nought shall make us rue 1819 ,</p>
<p>If England to itself do rest 1820 but true.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain ). Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster , and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside? (often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading ‘bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
<p>“This new Complete Works from the RSC is a glorious edition of one of
the world’s most important books. It’s the essential reference book for
anyone who’s ever been in love, felt jealousy, fear, hatred, or desire.
All human life is here - and every home should have one.“</p>
