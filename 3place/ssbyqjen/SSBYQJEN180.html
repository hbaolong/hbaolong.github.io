14</h4>
<p>Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano, [Nerissa ] and all their trains</p>
<p>PORTIA I pray you tarry 820 . Pause a day or two</p>
<p>Before you hazard, for in choosing 821 wrong</p>
<p>I lose your company: therefore forbear 822 awhile.</p>
<p>There’s something tells me, but it is not love,</p>
<p>I would not lose you, and you know yourself,</p>
<p>Hate counsels not in such a quality 823 ;</p>
<p>But lest you should not understand me well —</p>
<p>And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought 824 —</p>
<p>I would detain you here some month or two</p>
<p>Before you venture 825 for me. I could teach you</p>
<p>How to choose right, but then I am forsworn 826 .</p>
<p>So 827 will I never be. So 828 may you miss me 829 .</p>
<p>But if you do, you’ll make me wish a sin,</p>
<p>That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,</p>
<p>They have o’erlooked 830 me and divided me.</p>
<p>One half of me is yours, the other half yours,</p>
<p>Mine own, I would 831 say. But if mine, then yours,</p>
<p>And so all yours. O, these naughty 832 times</p>
<p>Puts bars 833 between the owners and their rights!</p>
<p>And so, though yours 834 , not yours. Prove it 835 so,</p>
<p>Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.</p>
<p>I speak too long, but ’tis to peise 836 the time,</p>
<p>To eke 837 it and to draw it out in length,</p>
<p>To stay 838 you from election 839 .</p>
<p>BASSANIO Let me choose,</p>
<p>For as I am, I live upon the rack 840 .</p>
<p>PORTIA Upon the rack, Bassanio? Then confess</p>
<p>What treason there is mingled with your love.</p>
<p>BASSANIO None but that ugly treason of mistrust 841 ,</p>
<p>Which makes me fear 842 the enjoying 843 of my love.</p>
<p>There may as well be amity and life</p>
<p>’Tween snow and fire, as 844 treason and my love.</p>
<p>PORTIA Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,</p>
<p>Where men enforcèd 845 do speak anything.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Promise me life, and I’ll confess the truth.</p>
<p>PORTIA Well then, confess and live 846 .</p>
<p>BASSANIO ‘Confess and love’</p>
<p>Had been the very sum of my confession.</p>
<p>O happy torment, when my torturer</p>
<p>Doth teach me answers for deliverance 847 !</p>
<p>But let me to 848 my fortune and the caskets.</p>
<p>PORTIA Away, then! I am locked in one of them.</p>
<p>If you do love me, you will find me out.</p>
<p>Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof 849 .</p>
<p>Let music sound while he doth make his choice,</p>
<p>Then if he lose, he makes a swan-like end 850 ,</p>
<p>Fading in music. That the comparison</p>
<p>May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream</p>
<p>And wat’ry death-bed for him. He may win,</p>
<p>And what is music then? Then music is</p>
<p>Even as the flourish 851 when true subjects bow</p>
<p>To a new-crownèd monarch. Such it is,</p>
<p>As are those dulcet 852 sounds in break of day,</p>
<p>That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear,</p>
<p>And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,</p>
<p>With no less presence 853 , but with much more love,</p>
<p>Than young Alcides 854 , when he did redeem</p>
<p>The virgin tribute paid by howling 855 Troy</p>
<p>To the sea-monster. I stand for 856 sacrifice,</p>
<p>The rest aloof are the Dardanian 857 wives,</p>
<p>With blearèd visages 858 , come forth to view</p>
<p>The issue 859 of th’exploit. Go, Hercules!</p>
<p>Live thou 860 , I live. With much, much more dismay</p>
<p>I view the fight than thou that mak’st the fray 861 .</p>
<p>Here music</p>
<p>A song the whilst Bassanio comments on the caskets to himself</p>
<p>[SINGER] Tell me where is fancy 862 bred,</p>
<p>Or 863 in the heart, or in the head?</p>
<p>How begot 864 , how nourishèd?</p>
<p>Reply, reply.</p>
<p>It is engendered in the eyes,</p>
<p>With gazing fed, and fancy dies</p>
<p>In the cradle 865 where it lies.</p>
<p>Let us all ring fancy’s knell 866 .</p>
<p>I’ll begin it — Ding, dong, bell.</p>
<p>ALL Ding, dong, bell.</p>
<p>BASSANIO So may the outward shows be least themselves 867 ,</p>
<p>The world is still 868 deceived with ornament.</p>
<p>In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,</p>
<p>But, being seasoned with a gracious 869 voice,</p>
<p>Obscures the show of evil? In religion,</p>
<p>What damnèd error, but some sober brow 870</p>
<p>Will bless it and approve 871 it with a text 872 ,</p>
<p>Hiding the grossness 873 with fair ornament?</p>
<p>There is no vice so simple 874 but assumes 875</p>
<p>Some mark of virtue on his 876 outward parts;</p>
<p>How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false</p>
<p>As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins</p>
<p>The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars 877 ,</p>
<p>Who, inward searched 878 , have livers white as milk 879 .</p>
<p>And these assume but valour’s excrement 880</p>
<p>To render them redoubted 881 . Look on beauty,</p>
<p>And you shall see ’tis purchased by the weight 882 ,</p>
<p>Which therein works a miracle in nature,</p>
<p>Making them lightest 883 that wear most of it:</p>
<p>So are those crispèd 884 snaky golden locks</p>
<p>Which makes such wanton 885 gambols with the wind</p>
<p>Upon supposèd fairness 886 , often known</p>
<p>To be the dowry of a second head,</p>
<p>The skull that bred them in the sepulchre 887 .</p>
<p>Thus ornament is but the guilèd 888 shore</p>
<p>To a most dangerous sea, the beauteous scarf</p>
<p>Veiling an Indian 889 beauty; in a word,</p>
<p>The seeming truth which cunning times put on</p>
<p>To entrap the wisest. Therefore, then, thou gaudy 890 gold,</p>
<p>Hard food for Midas 891 , I will none of thee;</p>
<p>Nor none of thee 892 , thou pale and common drudge 893</p>
<p>’Tween man and man. But thou, thou meagre lead,</p>
<p>Which rather threaten’st than dost promise aught,</p>
<p>Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence,</p>
<p>And here choose I. Joy be the consequence!</p>
<p>PORTIA How all the other passions fleet 894 to air,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>As 895 doubtful thoughts and rash-embraced 896 despair</p>
<p>And shudd’ring fear and green-eyed jealousy!</p>
<p>O love, be moderate, allay thy ecstasy,</p>
<p>In measure 897 rain 898 thy joy, scant 899 this excess.</p>
<p>I feel too much thy blessing. Make it less,</p>
<p>For fear I surfeit 900 .</p>
<p>BASSANIO What find I here?</p>
<p>He opens the lead casket</p>
<p>Fair Portia’s counterfeit 901 ! What demigod 902</p>
<p>Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes 903 ?</p>
<p>Or whether 904 , riding on the balls of mine 905 ,</p>
<p>Seem they in motion? Here are severed 906 lips,</p>
<p>Parted with sugar breath, so sweet a bar 907</p>
<p>Should sunder 908 such sweet friends. Here in her hairs</p>
<p>The painter plays the spider, and hath woven</p>
<p>A golden mesh t’entrap the hearts of men</p>
<p>Faster 909 than gnats in cobwebs. But her eyes —</p>
<p>How could he see to do them? Having made one,</p>
<p>Methinks it 910 should have power to steal both his</p>
<p>And leave itself unfurnished 911 . Yet look how far</p>
<p>The substance 912 of my praise doth wrong this shadow 913</p>
<p>In underprizing it, so far this shadow</p>
<p>Doth limp behind the substance. Here’s the scroll,</p>
<p>The continent 914 and summary of my fortune.</p>
<p>’You that choose not by the view</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>Chance as fair 915 and choose as true.</p>
<p>Since this fortune falls to you,</p>
<p>Be content and seek no new.</p>
<p>If you be well pleased with this</p>
<p>And hold your fortune for your bliss,</p>
<p>Turn you where your lady is</p>
<p>And claim her with a loving kiss.’</p>
<p>A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave,</p>
<p>I come by note 916 917 to give and to receive.</p>
<p>Like one of two contending in a prize 918</p>
<p>That thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes,</p>
<p>Hearing applause and universal shout,</p>
<p>Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt</p>
<p>Whether those peals of praise be his 919 or no,</p>
<p>So, thrice-fair lady, stand I, even so,</p>
<p>As doubtful whether what I see be true,</p>
<p>Until confirmed, signed, ratified 920 by you.</p>
<p>PORTIA You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,</p>
<p>Such as I am; though for myself alone</p>
<p>I would not be ambitious in my wish,</p>
<p>To wish myself much better, yet for you</p>
<p>I would be trebled twenty times myself,</p>
<p>A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,</p>
<p>That only to stand high in your account 921 ,</p>
<p>I might in virtues, beauties, livings 922 , friends,</p>
<p>Exceed account 923 . But the full sum 924 of me</p>
<p>Is sum of nothing, which to term in gross 925</p>
<p>Is an unlessoned girl, unschooled, unpractisèd 926 ,</p>
<p>Happy in this, she is not yet so old</p>
<p>But she may learn. Happier than this,</p>
<p>She is not bred so dull but she can learn;</p>
<p>Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit</p>
<p>Commits itself to yours to be directed,</p>
<p>As from her lord, her governor, her king.</p>
<p>Myself, and what is mine, to you and yours</p>
<p>Is now converted 927 . But 928 now I was the lord</p>
<p>Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,</p>
<p>Queen o’er myself, and even now, but now,</p>
<p>This house, these servants and this same myself</p>
<p>Are yours, my lord. I give them with this ring,</p>
<p>Which when you part from, lose or give away,</p>
<p>Let it presage 929 the ruin of your love</p>
<p>And be my vantage 930 to exclaim on 931 you.</p>
<p>Puts a ring on his finger</p>
<p>BASSANIO Madam, you have bereft me of all words,</p>
<p>Only my blood 932 speaks to you in my veins,</p>
<p>And there is such confusion 933 in my powers 934 ,</p>
<p>As after some oration fairly spoke</p>
<p>By a belovèd prince, there doth appear</p>
<p>Among the buzzing pleasèd multitude,</p>
<p>Where every something 935 being blent 936 together,</p>
<p>Turns to a wild 937 of nothing, save 938 of joy</p>
<p>Expressed and not expressed 939 . But when this ring</p>
<p>Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence.</p>
<p>O, then be bold 940 to say Bassanio’s dead!</p>
<p>NERISSA My lord and lady, it is now our time,</p>
<p>That 941 have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,</p>
<p>To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!</p>
<p>GRATIANO My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,</p>
<p>I wish you all the joy that you can wish,</p>
<p>For I am sure you can wish none 942 from me.</p>
<p>And when your honours mean to solemnize</p>
<p>The bargain of your faith 943 , I do beseech you,</p>
<p>Even 944 at that time I may be married too.</p>
<p>BASSANIO With all my heart, so 945 thou canst get a wife.</p>
<p>GRATIANO I thank your lordship, you have got me one.</p>
<p>My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:</p>
<p>You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid 946 .</p>
<p>You loved, I loved, for intermission 947</p>
<p>No more pertains to me, my lord, than you;</p>
<p>Your fortune stood 948 upon the caskets there,</p>
<p>And so did mine too, as the matter falls 949 ,</p>
<p>For wooing here until I sweat again,</p>
<p>And swearing till my very roof 950 was dry</p>
<p>With oaths of love, at last 951 , if promise last,</p>
<p>I got a promise of this fair one here</p>
<p>To have her love, provided that your fortune</p>
<p>Achieved her mistress.</p>
<p>PORTIA Is this true, Nerissa?</p>
<p>NERISSA Madam, it is so 952 , so you stand pleased withal.</p>
<p>BASSANIO And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?</p>
<p>GRATIANO Yes, faith 953 , my lord.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.</p>
<p>GRATIANO We’ll play with them the first boy 954 for a thousand
ducats.</p>
<p>NERISSA What, and stake down 955 ?</p>
<p>GRATIANO No, we shall ne’er win at that sport 956 , and stake down
957 .</p>
<p>But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel 958 ?</p>
<p>What, and my old Venetian friend Salerio?</p>
<p>Enter Lorenzo, Jessica and Salerio</p>
<p>BASSANIO Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,</p>
<p>If that the youth 959 of my new interest 960 here</p>
<p>Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,</p>
<p>I bid my very 961 friends and countrymen,</p>
<p>Sweet Portia, welcome.</p>
<p>PORTIA So do I, my lord. They are entirely welcome.</p>
<p>LORENZO I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,</p>
<p>My purpose was not to have seen you here,</p>
<p>But meeting with Salerio by the way,</p>
<p>He did entreat me, past all saying nay,</p>
<p>To come with him along.</p>
<p>SALERIO I did, my lord,</p>
<p>And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio</p>
<p>Commends him 962 to you.</p>
<p>Gives Bassanio a letter</p>
<p>BASSANIO Ere I ope 963 his letter,</p>
<p>I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.</p>
<p>SALERIO Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind,</p>
<p>Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there</p>
<p>Will show you his estate 964 .</p>
<p>[Bassanio ] opens the letter</p>
<p>GRATIANO Nerissa, cheer 965 yond 966 stranger, bid her welcome.</p>
<p>Your hand, Salerio. What’s the news from Venice?</p>
<p>How doth that royal 967 merchant, good Antonio?</p>
<p>I know he will be glad of our success,</p>
<p>We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.</p>
<p>SALERIO I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.</p>
<p>PORTIA There are some shrewd 968 contents in yond same paper,</p>
<p>That steals the colour from Bassanio’s cheek.</p>
<p>Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world</p>
<p>Could turn so much the constitution 969</p>
<p>Of any constant 970 man. What, worse and worse?</p>
<p>With leave 971 , Bassanio: I am half yourself 972 ,</p>
<p>And I must freely have the half of anything</p>
<p>That this same paper brings you.</p>
<p>BASSANIO O sweet Portia,</p>
<p>Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words</p>
<p>That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,</p>
<p>When I did first impart my love to you,</p>
<p>I freely told you all the wealth I had</p>
<p>Ran in my veins. I was a gentleman,</p>
<p>And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,</p>
<p>Rating 973 myself at nothing, you shall see</p>
<p>How much I was a braggart. When I told you</p>
<p>My state 974 was nothing, I should then have told you</p>
<p>That I was worse than nothing, for indeed,</p>
<p>I have engaged 975 myself to a dear friend,</p>
<p>Engaged my friend to his mere 976 enemy,</p>
<p>To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,</p>
<p>The paper as 977 the body of my friend,</p>
<p>And every word in it a gaping wound,</p>
<p>Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?</p>
<p>Hath all his ventures failed? What, not one hit 978 ?</p>
<p>From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,</p>
<p>From Lisbon, Barbary 979 and India?</p>
<p>And not one vessel scape the dreadful 980 touch</p>
<p>Of merchant-marring 981 rocks?</p>
<p>SALERIO Not one, my lord.</p>
<p>Besides, it should appear 982 , that if he had</p>
<p>The present 983 money to discharge 984 the Jew,</p>
<p>He 985 would not take it. Never did I know</p>
<p>A creature that did bear the shape of man</p>
<p>So keen and greedy to confound 986 a man.</p>
<p>He plies the duke at morning and at night,</p>
<p>And doth impeach 987 the freedom 988 of the state,</p>
<p>If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,</p>
<p>The duke himself and the magnificoes 989</p>
<p>Of greatest port 990 have all persuaded 991 with him,</p>
<p>But none can drive him from the envious 992 plea 993</p>
<p>Of forfeiture 994 , of justice and his bond.</p>
<p>JESSICA When I was with him I have heard him swear</p>
<p>To Tubal and to Chus 995 , his countrymen,</p>
<p>That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh</p>
<p>Than twenty times the value of the sum</p>
<p>That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,</p>
<p>If law, authority and power deny not,</p>
<p>It will go hard with 996 poor Antonio.</p>
<p>PORTIA Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?</p>
<p>BASSANIO The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,</p>
<p>The best-conditioned 997 and unwearied spirit</p>
<p>In doing courtesies 998 , and one in whom</p>
<p>The ancient Roman honour more appears</p>
<p>Than any that draws breath in Italy.</p>
<p>PORTIA What sum owes he the Jew?</p>
<p>BASSANIO For me three thousand ducats.</p>
<p>PORTIA What, no more?</p>
<p>Pay him six thousand and deface 999 the bond.</p>
<p>Double six thousand and then treble that,</p>
<p>Before a friend of this description</p>
<p>Shall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault.</p>
<p>First go with me to church and call me wife,</p>
<p>And then away to Venice to your friend,</p>
<p>For never shall you lie by Portia’s side</p>
<p>With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold</p>
<p>To pay the petty debt twenty times over.</p>
<p>When it is paid, bring your true friend along.</p>
<p>My maid Nerissa and myself meantime</p>
<p>Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!</p>
<p>For you shall hence 1000 upon your wedding day.</p>
<p>Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer 1001 ,</p>
<p>Since you are dear 1002 bought, I will love you dear.</p>
<p>But let me hear the letter of your friend.</p>
<p>BASSANIO ‘Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors
grow cruel, my estate 1003 is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit,
and since in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are
cleared between you and I, if I might see you at my death.
Notwithstanding 1004 , use your pleasure 1005 , if your love do not
persuade you to come, let not my letter.’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>PORTIA O love! Dispatch 1006 all business, and be gone!</p>
<p>BASSANIO Since I have your good leave to go away,</p>
<p>I will make haste; but till I come again,</p>
<p>No bed shall e’er be guilty of my stay,</p>
<p>No rest be interposer ’twixt us twain 1007 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
