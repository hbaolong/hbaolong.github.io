<h4 id="scene-5-running-scene-17">Scene 5 ／ running scene 17</h4>
<p>Enter Host [and ] Simple</p>
<p>HOST What wouldst thou have, boor 989 ? What, thick-skin 990 ? Speak,
breathe, discuss 991 : brief, short, quick, snap.</p>
<p>SIMPLE Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff from Master
Slender.</p>
<p>HOST There’s his chamber, his house, his castle, his standing-bed and
truckle-bed 992 . ’Tis painted about with the story of the Prodigal 993
, fresh and new. Go, knock and call. He’ll speak like an
Anthropophaginian 994 unto thee. Knock, I say.</p>
<p>SIMPLE There’s an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his chamber.
I’ll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come down. I come to speak with
her indeed.</p>
<p>HOST Ha? A fat woman? The knight may be robbed. I’ll call.— Bully
knight, bully Sir John! Speak from thy lungs military 995 . Art thou
there? It is thine host, thine Ephesian 996 , calls.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF How now, mine host?</p>
<p>Above or within</p>
<p>HOST Here’s a Bohemian-Tartar 997 tarries the coming down of thy fat
woman. Let her descend, bully, let her descend. My chambers are
honourable. Fie! Privacy 998 ? Fie!</p>
<p>[Enter Falstaff ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with me, but
she’s gone.</p>
<p>SIMPLE Pray you, sir, was’t not the wise woman 999 of Brentford?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell 1000 . What would you with
her?</p>
<p>SIMPLE My master, sir, my Master Slender, sent to her, seeing her go
through the streets, to know, sir, whether one Nim, sir, that beguiled
1001 him of a chain, had the chain or no.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I spake with the old woman about it.</p>
<p>SIMPLE And what says she, I pray, sir?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Marry, she says that the very same man that beguiled Master
Slender of his chain, cozened him of it.</p>
<p>SIMPLE I would I could have spoken with the woman herself: I had
other things to have spoken with her too, from him.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What are they? Let us know.</p>
<p>HOST Ay, come. Quick.</p>
<p>SIMPLE I may not conceal 1002 them, sir.</p>
<p>HOST Conceal them, or thou diest.</p>
<p>SIMPLE Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne Page, to
know if it were my master’s fortune to have her or no.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF ’Tis, ’tis his fortune.</p>
<p>SIMPLE What, sir?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF To have her or no. Go, say the woman told me so.</p>
<p>SIMPLE May I be bold to say so, sir?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Ay, sir, like who more bold 1003 .</p>
<p>SIMPLE I thank your worship. I shall make my master glad with these
tidings.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>HOST Thou art clerkly 1004 , thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was there a
wise woman with thee?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Ay, that there was, mine host, one that hath taught me more
wit than ever I learned before in my life. And I paid nothing for it
neither, but was paid for my learning.</p>
<p>[Enter Bardolph ]</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Out, alas, sir. Cozenage, mere 1005 cozenage!</p>
<p>HOST Where be my horses? Speak well of them, varletto 1006 .</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Run away with the cozeners, for so soon as I came beyond
Eton, they threw me off from behind one of them, in a slough of mire
1007 , and set spurs and away, like three German devils, three Doctor
Faustuses 1008 .</p>
<p>HOST They are gone but to meet the duke, villain. Do not say they be
fled. Germans are honest men.</p>
<p>[Enter Evans ]</p>
<p>EVANS Where is mine host?</p>
<p>HOST What is the matter, sir?</p>
<p>EVANS Have a care of your entertainments 1009 . There is a friend of
mine come to town tells me there is three cozen-germans 1010 that has
cozened all the hosts of Readings, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook 1011 , of
horses and money. I tell you for good will, look you. You are wise and
full of gibes and vlouting-stocks 1012 , and ’tis not convenient 1013
you should be cozened. Fare you well.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>[Enter Caius ]</p>
<p>CAIUS Vere is mine host de Jarteer?</p>
<p>HOST Here, Master Doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.</p>
<p>CAIUS I cannot tell vat is dat. But it is tell-a me dat you make
grand preparation for a duke de Jamany 1014 . By my trot, dere is no
duke that the court is know to come 1015 . I tell you for good will.
Adieu.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>HOST Hue and cry, villain 1016 , go!— Assist me, knight, I am
undone!—</p>
<p>To Bardolph/To Falstaff</p>
<p>Fly, run, hue and cry, villain! I am undone!</p>
<p>To Bardolph</p>
<p>[Exeunt Host and Bardolph ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I would all the world might be cozened, for I have been
cozened and beaten too. If it should come to the ear of the court, how I
have been transformed and how my transformation hath been washed and
cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by drop, and liquor
1017 fishermen’s boots with me. I warrant they would whip me with their
fine wits till I were as crestfallen as a dried pear. I never prospered
since I forswore myself at primero 1018 . Well, if my wind 1019 were but
long enough, I would repent.</p>
<p>[Enter Mistress Quickly ]</p>
<p>Now, whence come you?</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY From the two parties, forsooth.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF The devil take one party and his dam 1020 the other, and so
they shall be both bestowed 1021 . I have suffered more for their sakes,
more than the villainous inconstancy of man’s disposition is able to
bear.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant,
speciously 1022 one of them. Mistress Ford, good heart, is beaten black
and blue, that you cannot see a white spot about her.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What tell’st thou me of black and blue? I was beaten myself
into all the colours of the rainbow, and I was like 1023 to be
apprehended for the witch of Brentford. But 1024 that my admirable
dexterity of wit, my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,
delivered me, the knave constable had set me i’th’stocks, i’th’common
stocks, for a witch.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber. You
shall hear how things go, and, I warrant, to your content. Here is a
letter will say somewhat — good hearts, what ado here is to bring you
together! Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that you are so
crossed 1025 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Come up into my chamber.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
