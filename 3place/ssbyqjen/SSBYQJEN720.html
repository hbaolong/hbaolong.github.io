<h4 id="scene-4-663-running-scene-7">Scene 4 663 ／ running scene 7</h4>
<p>Enter two Drawers</p>
<p>FIRST DRAWER What hast thou brought there? Apple-johns 664 ? Thou
know’st Sir John cannot endure an apple-john.</p>
<p>SECOND DRAWER Thou say’st true. The prince once set a dish of
apple-johns before him, and told him there were five more Sir Johns,
and, putting off his hat, said ‘I will now take my leave of these six
dry, round, old, withered knights.’ It angered him to the heart, but he
hath forgot that.</p>
<p>FIRST DRAWER Why then, cover 665 and set them down, and see if thou
canst find out Sneak’s noise 666 ; Mistress Tearsheet would fain 667
have some music.</p>
<p>SECOND DRAWER Sirrah, here will be the prince and Master Poins anon
668 , and they will put on two of our jerkins 669 and aprons, and Sir
John must not know of it. Bardolph hath brought word.</p>
<p>FIRST DRAWER Then here will be old Utis 670 : it will be an excellent
stratagem.</p>
<p>SECOND DRAWER I’ll see if I can find out Sneak.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Hostess [Quickly ] and Doll [Tearsheet ]</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Sweetheart, methinks now you are in an excellent good
temperality 671 : your pulsidge 672 beats as extraordinarily 673 as
heart would desire; and your colour, I warrant you, is as red as any
rose. But, you have drunk too much canaries 674 , and that’s a
marvellous searching 675 wine, and it perfumes 676 the blood ere we can
say ‘What’s this?’ How do you now?</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Better than I was. Hem! 677</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Why, that was well said. A good heart’s worth gold.
Look, here comes Sir John.</p>
<p>Enter Falstaff</p>
<p>FALSTAFF ‘When Arthur first in court’ 678 —</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Empty the jordan 679 .—</p>
<p>To First Drawer</p>
<p>‘And was a worthy king’. How now, Mistress Doll?</p>
<p>[Exit First Drawer ]</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Sick of a calm 680 , yea, good sooth 681 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF So is all her sect 682 . If they be once in a calm, they are
sick 683 .</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET You muddy rascal, is that all the comfort you give
me?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF You make fat rascals 684 , Mistress Doll.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET I make 685 them? Gluttony and diseases make them, I
make them not.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF If the cook 686 make the gluttony, you help to make the
diseases, Doll. We catch of 687 you, Doll, we catch of you. Grant that,
my poor virtue, grant that.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Ay, marry, our chains and our jewels.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF ‘Your broaches, pearls and ouches 688 .’ 689 For to serve
690 bravely 691 is to come halting 692 off, you know. To come off the
breach 693 with his pike 694 bent bravely, and to surgery 695 bravely;
to venture upon the charged chambers 696 bravely—</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Why, this is the old fashion: you two never meet but
you fall to some discord. You are both, in good troth, as rheumatic 697
as two dry toasts. You cannot one bear with another’s confirmities 698 .
What the good year! 699 One must bear 700 , and that must be you: you
are the weaker vessel 701 , as they say, the emptier vessel.</p>
<p>To Doll</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full hogshead
702 ? There’s a whole merchant’s venture 703 of Bordeaux stuff 704 in
him. You have not seen a hulk 705 better stuffed in the hold. Come, I’ll
be friends with thee, Jack. Thou art going to the wars, and whether I
shall ever see thee again or no, there is nobody cares.</p>
<p>Enter [First ] Drawer</p>
<p>FIRST DRAWER Sir, Ancient 706 Pistol 707 is below, and would speak
with you.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Hang him, swaggering 708 rascal! Let him not come
hither: it is the foul-mouthed’st rogue in England.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY If he swagger, let him not come here. I must live
amongst my neighbours. I’ll 709 no swaggerers. I am in good name and
fame 710 with the very best. Shut the door, there comes no swaggerers
here. I have not lived all this while, to have swaggering now. Shut the
door, I pray you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Dost thou hear, hostess?</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Pray you, pacify yourself, Sir John. There comes no
swaggerers here.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Dost thou hear? It is mine ancient.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Tilly-fally 711 , Sir John, never tell me: your
ancient swaggerer comes not in my doors. I was before Master Tisick 712
, the deputy 713 , the other day, and as he said to me — it was no
longer ago than Wednesday last — ‘Neighbour Quickly’, says he —Master
Dumbe 714 , our minister, was by 715 then — ‘Neighbour Quickly,’ says
he, ‘receive 716 those that are civil; for’, sayeth he, ‘you are in an
ill name 717 .’ Now he aid so, I can tell whereupon 718 . ‘For’, says
he, ‘you are an honest woman, and well thought on; therefore take heed
what guests you receive. Receive’, says he, ‘no swaggering companions
719 .’ There comes none here. You would bless you 720 to hear what he
said. No, I’ll no swaggerers.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF He’s no swaggerer, hostess: a tame 721 cheater 722 he. You
may stroke him as gently as a puppy greyhound. He will not swagger with
a Barbary hen 723 , if her feathers turn back in any show of
resistance.— Call him up, drawer.</p>
<p>[Exit First Drawer ]</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY ‘Cheater’, call you him? I will bar no honest man my
house, nor no cheater, but I do not love swaggering. I am the worse 724
when one says ‘swagger’. Feel, masters, how I shake. Look you, I warrant
you.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET So you do, hostess.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Do I? Yea, in very truth do I, if it 725 were an
aspen leaf: I cannot abide swaggerers.</p>
<p>Enter Pistol, and Bardolph and his Boy</p>
<p>PISTOL Save you, Sir John!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Welcome, Ancient Pistol. Here, Pistol, I charge 726 you with
a cup of sack. Do you discharge 727 upon mine hostess.</p>
<p>PISTOL I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two bullets 728
.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF She is Pistol-proof 729 , sir. You shall hardly 730 offend
her.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Come 731 , I’ll drink 732 no proofs nor no bullets: I
will drink no more than will do me good, for no man’s pleasure, I.</p>
<p>PISTOL Then to you, Mistress Dorothy 733 . I will charge you.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Charge 734 me? I scorn you, scurvy 735 companion.
What? You poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen mate 736 ! Away,
you mouldy rogue, away! I am meat for your master 737 .</p>
<p>PISTOL I know 738 you, Mistress Dorothy.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Away, you cutpurse 739 rascal, you filthy bung 740 ,
away! By this wine, I’ll thrust my knife in your mouldy chaps 741 , if
you play the saucy cuttle 742 with me. Away, you bottle-ale 743 rascal,
you basket-hilt 744 stale juggler 745 , you! Since when 746 , I pray
you, sir? What, with two points 747 on your shoulder? Much! 748</p>
<p>PISTOL I will murder 749 your ruff 750 for this.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY No, Good Captain 751 Pistol. Not here, sweet
captain.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Captain? Thou abominable damned cheater, art thou not
ashamed to be called captain? If captains were of my mind, they would
truncheon 752 you out 753 for taking their names upon you before you
have earned them. You a captain? You slave, for what? For tearing a poor
whore’s ruff in a bawdy-house 754 ? He a captain? Hang him, rogue! He
lives upon mouldy stewed prunes 755 and dried 756 cakes. A captain?
These villains will make the word ‘captain’ odious: therefore captains
had need look to it 757 .</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Pray thee go down 758 , good ancient.</p>
<p>To Pistol</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.</p>
<p>PISTOL Not I. I tell thee what, Corporal Bardolph, I could tear her.
I’ll be revenged on her.</p>
<p>PAGE Pray thee go down.</p>
<p>To Pistol</p>
<p>PISTOL I’ll see her damned first 759</p>
<p>To Pluto’s damnèd lake 760 ,</p>
<p>To the infernal deep,</p>
<p>With Erebus 761 and tortures vile also.</p>
<p>Hold hook and line 762 , say I.</p>
<p>Down, down, dogs! Down, Fates 763 !</p>
<p>Have we not Hiren 764 here?</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Good Captain Peesel 765 , be quiet. It is very late.
I beseek 766 you now,</p>
<p>aggravate 767 your choler 768 .</p>
<p>PISTOL These be good humours 769 indeed. Shall pack-horses</p>
<p>And hollow pampered jades 770 of Asia,</p>
<p>Which cannot go but thirty miles a day 771 ,</p>
<p>Compare with Caesar and with cannibals 772 ,</p>
<p>And Trojan Greeks 773 ?</p>
<p>Nay, rather damn them with King Cerberus 774 ,</p>
<p>And let the welkin 775 roar. Shall we fall foul for toys 776 ?</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY By my troth, captain, these are very bitter
words.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Be gone, good ancient: this will grow to a brawl anon.</p>
<p>PISTOL Die men 777 like dogs! Give crowns like pins 778 !</p>
<p>Have we not Hiren here?</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY On my word, captain, there’s none such here. What the
goodyear, do you think I would deny her 779 ? I pray be quiet.</p>
<p>PISTOL Then feed, and be fat, my fair Calipolis 780 .</p>
<p>Come, give me some sack.</p>
<p>Si fortune me tormente, sperato me contento 781 .</p>
<p>Fear we broadsides 782 ? No, let the fiend give fire 783 .</p>
<p>Give me some sack. And, sweetheart, lie thou there..</p>
<p>Lays down his sword</p>
<p>Come we to full points 784 here? And are etceteras nothing 785 ?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Pistol, I would be quiet.</p>
<p>PISTOL Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf 786 . What, we have seen the
seven stars 787 !</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Thrust him downstairs. I cannot endure such a fustian
788 rascal.</p>
<p>PISTOL ‘Thrust him down stairs’? Know we not Galloway nags 789 ?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Quoit 790 him down, Bardolph, like a shove-groat shilling
791 . Nay, if he do nothing but speak nothing, he shall be nothing
here.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Come, get you downstairs.</p>
<p>PISTOL What? Shall we have incision 792 ? Shall we imbrue 793 ?.</p>
<p>Snatches up his sword</p>
<p>Then death rock me asleep 794 , abridge 795 my doleful days.</p>
<p>Why then, let grievous, ghastly, gaping wounds</p>
<p>Untwined 796 the Sisters Three 797 ! Come, Atropos 798 , I say!</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Here’s good stuff toward 799 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Give me my rapier 800 , boy.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET I prithee, Jack, I prithee do not draw.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Get you downstairs.</p>
<p>Draws and attacks Pistol</p>
<p>[Exit Pistol, driven out by Bardolph ]</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Here’s a goodly tumult! I’ll forswear 801 keeping
house 802 , before I’ll be in these tirrits 803 and frights. So, murder,
I warrant now. Alas, alas, put up your naked weapons 804 , put up your
naked weapons.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET I prithee, Jack, be quiet. The rascal is gone. Ah, you
whoreson little valiant villain, you!</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Are you not hurt i’th’groin? Methought he made a
shrewd 805 thrust at your belly.</p>
<p>[Enter Bardolph ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Have you turned him out of doors?</p>
<p>To Bardolph</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Yes, sir. The rascal’s drunk. You have hurt him, sir, in the
shoulder.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF A rascal to brave 806 me!</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Ah, you sweet little rogue, you! Alas, poor ape, how
thou sweat’st! Come, let me wipe thy face. Come on, you whoreson chops
807 . Ah, rogue, I love thee. Thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy 808
, worth five of Agamemnon 809 , and ten times better than the Nine
Worthies 810 . Ah, villain!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF A rascally slave, I will toss the rogue in a blanket 811
.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Do, if thou dar’st for thy heart. If thou dost, I’ll
canvass thee between a pair of sheets 812 .</p>
<p>Enter Musicians</p>
<p>PAGE The music is come, sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Let them play.— Play, sirs.— Sit on my knee, Doll. A rascal
bragging slave! The rogue fled from me like quicksilver 813 .</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET And thou followed’st him like a church 814 . Thou
whoreson little tidy 815 Bartholomew boar-pig 816 , when wilt thou leave
fighting on days and foining 817 on nights, and begin to patch up thine
old body for heaven?</p>
<p>Enter the Prince and Poins, disguised</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Peace, good Doll. Do not speak like a death’s-head 818 , do
not bid me remember mine end.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Sirrah, what humour 819 is the prince of?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF A good shallow young fellow: he would have made a good
pantler 820 , he would have chipped bread 821 well.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET They say Poins hath a good wit.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF He a good wit? Hang him, baboon! His wit is as thick as
Tewkesbury mustard 822 . There is no more conceit 823 in him than is in
a mallet.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Why doth the prince love him so, then?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Because their legs are both of a 824 bigness 825 , and he
plays at quoits 826 well, and eats conger and fennel 827 , and drinks
off candles’ ends for flap-dragons 828 829 , and rides the wild-mare 830
with the boys, and jumps upon joint-stools 831 832 , and swears with a
good grace, and wears his boot very smooth 833 , like unto the sign of
the leg 834 , and breeds no bate 835 with telling of discreet 836
stories, and such other gambol 837 faculties he hath, that show a weak
mind and an able body, for the which the prince admits 838 him; for the
prince himself is such another 839 . The weight of an hair will turn the
scales between their avoirdupois 840 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Would not this nave of a wheel 841 have his ears cut off
842 ?</p>
<p>Aside to Poins</p>
<p>POINS Let us beat him before his whore.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Look, if the withered elder 843 hath not his poll 844
clawed like a parrot 845 .</p>
<p>POINS Is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive
performance?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Kiss me, Doll.</p>
<p>She kisses him</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Saturn and Venus 846 this year in conjunction 847 ! What
says the almanac 848 to that?</p>
<p>Aside to Poins</p>
<p>POINS And look whether the fiery Trigon 849 , his man, be not lisping
850 to his master’s old tables 851 , his notebook, his counsel-keeper
852 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Thou dost give me flatt’ring busses 853 .</p>
<p>To Doll</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Nay truly, I kiss thee with a most constant heart.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I am old, I am old.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET I love thee better than I love e’er a scurvy young boy
of them all.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What stuff 854 wilt thou have a kirtle 855 of? I shall
receive money on Thursday. Thou shalt have a cap tomorrow. A merry song,
come. It grows late. We will to bed. Thou wilt forget me when I am
gone.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Thou wilt set me a-weeping, if thou say’st so. Prove
that ever I dress myself handsome 856 till thy return. Well, hearken the
end 857 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Some sack, Francis.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY and POINS Anon 858 , anon, sir.</p>
<p>Stepping forward</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Ha? A bastard son of the king’s?— And art not thou Poins his
859 brother?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Why, thou globe of sinful continents 860 , what a life
dost thou lead!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF A better than thou: I am a gentleman, thou art a drawer.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Very true, sir, and I come to draw you out by the
ears.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY O, the lord preserve thy good grace! Welcome to
London. Now, heaven bless that sweet face of thine! What, are you come
from Wales?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Thou whoreson mad compound 861 of majesty, by this light 862
flesh and corrupt blood, thou art welcome.</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET How? You fat fool, I scorn you.</p>
<p>POINS My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge and turn all to
a merriment, if you take not the heat 863 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY You whoreson candle-mine 864 , you, how vilely did you
speak of me even now before this honest 865 , virtuous, civil
gentlewoman!</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Blessing on your good heart, and so she is, by my
troth.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Didst thou hear me?</p>
<p>To Prince Henry</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Yes, and you knew 866 me, as you did when you ran away
by Gad’s Hill: you knew I was at your back, and spoke it on purpose to
try my patience.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF No, no, no, not so. I did not think thou wast within
hearing.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse 867 ,
and then I know how to handle you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF No abuse, Hal, on mine honour, no abuse.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Not to dispraise me, and call me pantler and
bread-chopper and I know not what?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF No abuse, Hal.</p>
<p>POINS No abuse?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF No abuse, Ned, in the world, honest Ned, none. I dispraised
him before the wicked, that the wicked might not fall in love with him —
in which doing, I have done the part of a careful friend and a true
subject, and thy father is to give me thanks for it. No abuse, Hal.—
None, Ned, none.— No, boys, none.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY See now whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not
make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close 868 with us? Is she
of the wicked 869 ? Is thine hostess here of the wicked? Or is the boy
of the wicked? Or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in his nose 870 , of
the wicked?</p>
<p>POINS Answer, thou dead elm 871 , answer.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF The fiend hath pricked 872 down Bardolph irrecoverable, and
his face is Lucifer’s privy-kitchen 873 874 , where he doth nothing but
roast malt-worms. For the boy, there is a good angel about him, but the
devil outbids 875 him too.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY For the women?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF For one of them, she is in hell already, and burns 876 poor
souls. For the other, I owe her money, and whether she be damned for
that 877 , I know not.</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY No, I warrant you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF No, I think thou art not. I think thou art quit 878 for
that. Marry, there is another indictment upon thee, for suffering 879
flesh to be eaten 880 in thy house, contrary to the law, for the which I
think thou wilt howl 881 .</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY All victuallers 882 do so. What is a joint of mutton
883 or two in a whole Lent?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY You, gentlewoman—</p>
<p>To Doll</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET What says your grace?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF His grace 884 says that which his flesh rebels against 885
.</p>
<p>Knocking within</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Who knocks so loud at door? Look to the door there,
Francis.</p>
<p>Enter Peto</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Peto, how now? What news?</p>
<p>PETO The king your father is at Westminster 886 ,</p>
<p>And there are twenty weak and wearied posts 887</p>
<p>Come from the north, and as I came along,</p>
<p>I met and overtook a dozen captains,</p>
<p>Bare-headed 888 , sweating, knocking at the taverns,</p>
<p>And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame,</p>
<p>So idly to profane 889 the precious time,</p>
<p>When tempest of commotion 890 , like the south 891</p>
<p>Borne with black vapour 892 , doth begin to melt</p>
<p>And drop upon our bare unarmèd heads.—</p>
<p>Give me my sword and cloak.— Falstaff, goodnight.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Prince Henry, Poins and Peto ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Now comes in the sweetest morsel 893 of the night, and we
must hence and leave it unpicked 894 . More knocking at the door? How
now? What’s the matter?</p>
<p>Knocking within</p>
<p>Bardolph goes to the door</p>
<p>BARDOLPH You must away to court, sir, presently 895 .</p>
<p>A dozen captains stay 896 at door for you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Pay the musicians, sirrah.— Farewell, hostess.— Farewell,
Doll. You see, my good wenches, how men of merit are sought after. The
undeserver may sleep, when the man of action is called on. Farewell good
wenches. If I be not sent away post 897 , I will see you again ere I
go.</p>
<p>To the Page</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET I cannot speak. If my heart be not ready to burst —
well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Farewell, farewell.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Falstaff, Bardolph and Page ]</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY Well, fare thee well. I have known 898 thee these
twenty-nine years, come peascod-time 899 , but an honester and
truer-hearted man — well, fare thee well.</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Mistress Tearsheet!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY What’s the matter?</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Bid Mistress Tearsheet come to my master.</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>HOSTESS QUICKLY O, run, Doll, run. Run, good Doll!</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
