<h4 id="scene-2-228-running-scene-2">Scene 2 228 / running scene 2</h4>
<p>Hautboys 229 playing loud music. A great banquet served in: and then
enter Lord Timon, the States 230 , the Athenian Lords, [Alcibiades and ]
Ventidius, which Timon redeemed from prison. Then comes, dropping 231 ,
after all, Apemantus, discontentedly, like himself</p>
<p>VENTIDIUS Most honoured Timon,</p>
<p>It hath pleased the gods to remember my father’s age,</p>
<p>And call him to long peace 232 .</p>
<p>He is gone happy, and has left me rich:</p>
<p>Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound</p>
<p>To your free 233 heart, I do return those talents,</p>
<p>Doubled with thanks and service 234 , from whose help</p>
<p>I derived liberty.</p>
<p>Offers money</p>
<p>TIMON O, by no means,</p>
<p>Honest Ventidius. You mistake my love:</p>
<p>I gave it freely ever 235 , and there’s none</p>
<p>Can truly say he gives if he receives 236 .</p>
<p>If our betters play at that game 237 , we must not dare</p>
<p>To imitate them: faults that are rich are fair 238 .</p>
<p>VENTIDIUS A noble spirit!</p>
<p>The Lords stand ceremoniously</p>
<p>TIMON Nay, my lords,</p>
<p>Ceremony 239 was but devised at first</p>
<p>To set a gloss on 240 faint 241 deeds, hollow 242 welcomes,</p>
<p>Recanting goodness 243 , sorry ere 244 ’tis shown,</p>
<p>But where there is true friendship, there needs none 245 .</p>
<p>Pray, sit: more welcome are ye to my fortunes</p>
<p>Than my fortunes to me.</p>
<p>They sit</p>
<p>FIRST LORD My lord, we always have confessed 246 it.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Ho, ho, confessed it? Hanged 247 it, have you not?</p>
<p>TIMON O, Apemantus, you are welcome.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS No, you shall not make me welcome:</p>
<p>I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.</p>
<p>TIMON Fie 248 , thou’rt a churl 249 : ye’ve got a humour 250
there</p>
<p>Does not become 251 a man: ’tis much to blame.</p>
<p>They say, my lords, Ira furor brevis est 252 ,</p>
<p>But yond 253 man is ever angry.</p>
<p>Go, let him have a table by himself,</p>
<p>For he does neither affect 254 company,</p>
<p>Nor is he fit for’t, indeed.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Let me stay at thine apperil 255 , Timon:</p>
<p>I come to observe 256 , I give thee warning on’t 257 .</p>
<p>TIMON I take no heed 258 of thee; thou’rt an Athenian, therefore
welcome. I myself would 259 have no power 260 : prithee let my meat make
thee silent 261 .</p>
<p>APEMANTUS I scorn thy meat: ’twould choke me, for I should ne’er
flatter thee 262 . O you gods, what a number of men eats 263 Timon, and
he sees ’em not! It grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one
man’s blood 264 , and all the madness is, he cheers them up 265 too.</p>
<p>I wonder men dare trust themselves with men.</p>
<p>Methinks they should invite them without knives 266 :</p>
<p>Good for their meat 267 , and safer for their lives.</p>
<p>There’s much example 268 for’t: the fellow that sits next him, now
parts bread with him, pledges the breath of him 269 in a divided draught
270 , is the readiest man to kill him: ’t’as been proved. If I were a
huge 271 man, I should fear to drink at meals, Lest they should spy my
windpipe’s dangerous notes 272 273 :</p>
<p>Great men should drink with harness 274 on their throats.</p>
<p>TIMON My lord, in heart 275 , and let the health 276 go round.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Let it flow this way, my good lord.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS ‘Flow this way’? A brave 277 fellow: he keeps his tides 278
well 279 . Those healths 280 will make thee and thy state 281 look ill
282 , Timon.</p>
<p>Here’s that which is too weak to be a sinner 283 —</p>
<p>Honest water — which ne’er left man i’th’mire 284 .</p>
<p>This and my food are equals, there’s no odds 285 .</p>
<p>Feasts are too proud 286 to give thanks to the gods.</p>
<p>Apemantus’ grace 287</p>
<p>Immortal gods, I crave no pelf 288 .</p>
<p>I pray for no man but myself:</p>
<p>Grant I may never prove so fond 289 ,</p>
<p>To trust man on his oath or bond,</p>
<p>Or a harlot 290 for her weeping</p>
<p>Or a dog that seems a-sleeping,</p>
<p>Or a keeper 291 with my freedom,</p>
<p>Or my friends if I should need ’em.</p>
<p>Amen. So fall to’t 292 .</p>
<p>Rich men sin, and I eat root 293 .</p>
<p>Much good dich 294 thy good heart, Apemantus!</p>
<p>Eats</p>
<p>TIMON Captain Alcibiades, your heart’s in the field 295 now.</p>
<p>ALCIBIADES My heart is ever at your service, my lord.</p>
<p>TIMON You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies 296 than a dinner
of friends.</p>
<p>ALCIBIADES So 297 they were bleeding new 298 , my lord, there’s no
meat like ’em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then, that
then thou mightst kill ’em and bid me to ’em 299 !</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you would
once use our hearts 300 whereby we might express some part of our zeals
301 , we should think ourselves for ever perfect 302 .</p>
<p>TIMON O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods themselves have
provided that I shall have much help from you: how had you been my
friends else 303 ? Why have you that charitable 304 title from 305
thousands, did not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told more of
you 306 to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf,
and thus far I confirm 307 you. O you gods, think I, what need we have
any friends if we should ne’er have need of ’em? They were the most
needless 308 creatures living, should we ne’er have use for ’em, and
would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keeps their
sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished myself poorer, that I
might come nearer to you. We are born to do benefits 309 : and what
better or properer 310 can we call our own than the riches of our
friends 311 ? O, what a precious comfort ’tis to have so many like
brothers commanding 312 one another’s fortunes! O joy’s e’en made away
ere’t can be born 313 : mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks. To
forget their faults 314 , I drink to you.</p>
<p>Weeps, and drinks</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Thou weep’st to make them drink 315 , Timon.</p>
<p>a toast</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Joy had the like 316 conception in our eyes</p>
<p>To Timon</p>
<p>And at that instant like a babe sprung up 317 .</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard 318 .</p>
<p>THIRD LORD I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.</p>
<p>To Timon</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Much! 319</p>
<p>Sound tucket 320</p>
<p>TIMON What means that trump 321 ? How now?</p>
<p>Enter Servant</p>
<p>SERVANT Please 322 you, my lord, there are certain ladies most
desirous of admittance 323 .</p>
<p>TIMON Ladies? What are their wills?</p>
<p>SERVANT There comes with them a forerunner 324 , my lord, which bears
that office to signify their pleasures 325 .</p>
<p>TIMON I pray, let them be admitted.</p>
<p>Enter Cupid 326 with the masque 327 of Ladies</p>
<p>The Masquers stay back</p>
<p>CUPID Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all that</p>
<p>Of his bounties taste! The five best senses</p>
<p>Acknowledge thee their patron, and come freely</p>
<p>To gratulate 328 thy plenteous bosom 329 :</p>
<p>There 330 taste, touch, all 331 , pleased from thy table rise.</p>
<p>They only now come but 332 to feast thine eyes.</p>
<p>TIMON They’re welcome all, let ’em have kind 333 admittance:</p>
<p>Music, make their welcome!</p>
<p>Cupid brings forward the Masquers</p>
<p>FIRST LORD You see, my lord, how ample 334 you’re beloved.</p>
<p>Enter the Masquers of Amazons 335 , with lutes in their hands,
dancing and playing</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Hoyday 336 , what a sweep 337 of vanity comes this way!</p>
<p>They dance? They are madwomen.</p>
<p>Like 338 madness is the glory 339 of this life</p>
<p>As this pomp 340 shows to a little oil and root 341 .</p>
<p>We make ourselves fools to disport 342 ourselves,</p>
<p>And spend 343 our flatteries, to drink 344 those men</p>
<p>Upon whose age 345 we void 346 it up again</p>
<p>With poisonous spite and envy 347 .</p>
<p>Who lives that’s not depravèd 348 or depraves?</p>
<p>Who dies that bears not one spurn 349 to their graves</p>
<p>Of their friends’ gift 350 ?</p>
<p>I should fear those that dance before me now</p>
<p>Would one day stamp upon me. ’T’as been done:</p>
<p>Men shut their doors against a setting sun.</p>
<p>The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of 351 Timon, and to
show their loves each single out an Amazon and all dance, men with
women, a lofty strain 352 or two to the hautboys, and cease</p>
<p>TIMON You have done our pleasures much grace 353 , fair ladies,</p>
<p>Set a fair fashion on 354 our entertainment,</p>
<p>Which was not half so beautiful and kind 355 :</p>
<p>You have added worth unto’t and lustre,</p>
<p>And entertained me with mine own device 356 .</p>
<p>I am to thank you for’t.</p>
<p>FIRST LADY My lord, you take us even at the best 357 .</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Faith, for 358 the worst 359 is filthy 360 , and would not
hold taking 361 , I doubt me 362 .</p>
<p>TIMON Ladies, there is an idle 363 banquet 364 attends 365 you:</p>
<p>Please you to dispose yourselves 366 .</p>
<p>ALL LADIES Most thankfully, my lord.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Cupid and Ladies ]</p>
<p>TIMON Flavius.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS My lord.</p>
<p>TIMON The little casket bring me hither.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS Yes, my lord.— More jewels yet!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>There is no crossing 367 him in’s humour 368 ,</p>
<p>Else I should tell him well 369 — i’ faith I should —</p>
<p>When all’s spent, he’d be crossed 370 then, an 371 he could.</p>
<p>’Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind 372 ,</p>
<p>That man might ne’er be wretched for his mind 373 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Where be our men?</p>
<p>SERVANT Here, my lord, in readiness.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Our horses.</p>
<p>Enter Flavius</p>
<p>Carrying the casket</p>
<p>TIMON O, my friends,</p>
<p>I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,</p>
<p>I must entreat you honour me so much</p>
<p>Gives a jewel from the casket</p>
<p>As to advance 374 this jewel. Accept it and wear it,</p>
<p>Kind my lord.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD I am so far already in your gifts 375 —</p>
<p>ALL So are we all.</p>
<p>Timon gives jewels to all</p>
<p>Enter a Servant</p>
<p>SERVANT My lord, there are certain nobles of the senate</p>
<p>Newly alighted and come to visit you.</p>
<p>TIMON They are fairly 376 welcome.</p>
<p>[Exit Servant ]</p>
<p>FLAVIUS I beseech your honour,</p>
<p>Vouchsafe 377 me a word: it does concern you near 378 .</p>
<p>TIMON Near? Why then, another time I’ll hear thee.</p>
<p>I prithee, let’s be provided 379 to show them entertainment.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS I scarce know how.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Enter another Servant</p>
<p>SECOND SERVANT May it please your honour, Lord Lucius —</p>
<p>Out of his free 380 love — hath presented to you</p>
<p>Four milk-white horses trapped 381 in silver.</p>
<p>TIMON I shall accept them fairly. Let the presents</p>
<p>Be worthily entertained 382 .</p>
<p>[Exit Second Servant ]</p>
<p>Enter a Third Servant</p>
<p>How now? What news?</p>
<p>THIRD SERVANT Please you, my lord, that honourable gentleman, Lord
Lucullus, entreats your company tomorrow to hunt with him, and has sent
your honour two brace 383 of greyhounds.</p>
<p>TIMON I’ll hunt with him, and let them be received</p>
<p>Not without fair 384 reward.</p>
<p>[Exit Third Servant ]</p>
<p>FLAVIUS What will this come to?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,</p>
<p>And all out of an empty coffer 385 :</p>
<p>Nor will he know his purse 386 , or yield me this 387 ,</p>
<p>To show him what a beggar his heart is,</p>
<p>Being of no power to make his wishes good 388 .</p>
<p>His promises fly so beyond his state 389</p>
<p>That what he speaks is all in debt, he owes</p>
<p>For ev’ry word: he is so kind that he now</p>
<p>Pays interest for’t; his land’s put to their books 390 .</p>
<p>Well, would 391 I were gently put out of office</p>
<p>Before I were forced out.</p>
<p>Happier is he that has no friend to feed</p>
<p>Than such that do e’en enemies exceed 392 .</p>
<p>I bleed inwardly for my lord.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>TIMON You do yourselves</p>
<p>To the Lords</p>
<p>Much wrong, you bate 393 too much of your own merits.</p>
<p>Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.</p>
<p>Gives a gift to Second Lord</p>
<p>SECOND LORD With more than common thanks I will receive it.</p>
<p>THIRD LORD O, he’s the very soul of bounty!</p>
<p>TIMON And now I remember, my lord, you gave</p>
<p>To First Lord</p>
<p>Good words 394 the other day of a bay courser 395</p>
<p>I rode on. ’Tis yours, because you liked it.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD O, I beseech you pardon me, my lord, in that 396 .</p>
<p>TIMON You may take my word, my lord: I know, no man</p>
<p>Can justly praise but what he does affect 397 .</p>
<p>I weigh my friend’s affection with mine own 398 ,</p>
<p>I’ll tell you true. I’ll call to 399 you.</p>
<p>ALL LORDS O, none so welcome.</p>
<p>TIMON I take all and your several visitations 400</p>
<p>So kind to heart, ’tis not enough to give:</p>
<p>Methinks I could deal 401 kingdoms to my friends,</p>
<p>And ne’er be weary.— Alcibiades,</p>
<p>Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich.</p>
<p>It comes in charity to thee, for all thy living 402</p>
<p>Gives a gift?</p>
<p>Is ’mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast</p>
<p>Lie in a pitched field 403 .</p>
<p>ALCIBIADES Ay, defiled 404 land, my lord.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD We are so virtuously bound 405 —</p>
<p>TIMON And so am I to you.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD So infinitely endeared 406 —</p>
<p>TIMON All to you 407 .— Lights, more lights!</p>
<p>Calls</p>
<p>FIRST LORD The best of happiness,</p>
<p>Honour and fortunes keep with you, Lord Timon!</p>
<p>TIMON Ready for 408 his friends.</p>
<p>Exeunt Lords. [Apemantus and Timon remain ]</p>
<p>APEMANTUS What a coil 409 ’s here,</p>
<p>Serving 410 of becks 411 and jutting-out of bums!</p>
<p>I doubt whether their legs 412 be worth the sums</p>
<p>That are given for ’em. Friendship’s full of dregs 413 :</p>
<p>Methinks false 414 hearts should never have sound legs,</p>
<p>Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies.</p>
<p>TIMON Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen I would be good to
thee.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS No, I’ll 415 nothing; for if I should be bribed too, there
would be none left to rail upon 416 thee, and then thou wouldst sin the
faster. Thou giv’st so long, Timon, I fear me 417 thou wilt give away
thyself in paper 418 shortly. What needs these feasts, pomps and
