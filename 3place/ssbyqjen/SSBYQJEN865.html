continues</h4>
<p>Enter the old Duchess of York with the two children of Clarence</p>
<p>BOY Good grandam 608 , tell us, is our father dead?</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK No, boy.</p>
<p>DAUGHTER Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,</p>
<p>And cry ‘O Clarence, my unhappy son’?</p>
<p>BOY Why do you look on us, and shake your head,</p>
<p>And call us orphans, wretches 609 , castaways 610 ,</p>
<p>If that our noble father were alive?</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK My pretty cousins 611 , you mistake me both:</p>
<p>I do lament the sickness of the king,</p>
<p>As 612 loath to lose him, not your father’s death.</p>
<p>It were lost 613 sorrow to wail one that’s lost.</p>
<p>BOY Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.</p>
<p>The king mine uncle is to blame for it.</p>
<p>God will revenge it, whom I will importune 614</p>
<p>With earnest prayers all to that effect.</p>
<p>DAUGHTER And so will I.</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Peace, children, peace. The king doth love you
well.</p>
<p>Incapable 615 and shallow 616 innocents,</p>
<p>You cannot guess who caused your father’s death.</p>
<p>BOY Grandam, we can, for my good uncle Gloucester</p>
<p>Told me the king, provoked to it by the queen,</p>
<p>Devised impeachments 617 to imprison him;</p>
<p>And when my uncle told me so, he wept,</p>
<p>And pitied me, and kindly 618 kissed my cheek,</p>
<p>Bade me rely on him as on my father,</p>
<p>And he would love me dearly as a child.</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape 619
,</p>
<p>And with a virtuous visor 620 hide deep vice!</p>
<p>He is my son — ay, and therein my shame.</p>
<p>Yet from my dugs 621 he drew not this deceit.</p>
<p>BOY Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Ay, boy.</p>
<p>BOY I cannot think it. Hark, what noise is this?</p>
<p>Wailing within</p>
<p>Enter the Queen with her hair about her ears 622 , Rivers and Dorset
after her</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,</p>
<p>To chide 623 my fortune, and torment myself?</p>
<p>I’ll join with black 624 despair against my soul,</p>
<p>And to myself become an enemy 625 .</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK What means this scene of rude impatience 626 ?</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH To make an act 627 of tragic violence.</p>
<p>Edward, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead.</p>
<p>Why grow the branches when the root is gone?</p>
<p>Why wither not the leaves that want 628 their sap?</p>
<p>If you will live, lament: if die, be brief 629 ,</p>
<p>That our swift-wingèd souls may catch 630 the king’s,</p>
<p>Or, like obedient subjects, follow him</p>
<p>To his new kingdom of ne’er-changing night.</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Ah, so much interest 631 have I in thy sorrow</p>
<p>As I had title in 632 thy noble husband.</p>
<p>I have bewept a worthy husband’s death,</p>
<p>And lived with looking on his images 633 :</p>
<p>But now two mirrors 634 of his princely semblance 635</p>
<p>Are cracked in pieces by malignant death,</p>
<p>And I for comfort have but one false glass 636 ,</p>
<p>That grieves me when I see my shame in him.</p>
<p>Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother,</p>
<p>And hast the comfort of thy children left.</p>
<p>But death hath snatched my husband from mine arms,</p>
<p>And plucked two crutches from my feeble hands,</p>
<p>Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I,</p>
<p>Thine being but a moiety 637 of my moan,</p>
<p>To overgo 638 thy woes and drown thy cries.</p>
<p>BOY Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father’s death:</p>
<p>To the Queen</p>
<p>How can we aid you with our kindred 639 tears?</p>
<p>DAUGHTER Our fatherless distress was left unmoaned 640 .</p>
<p>Your widow-dolour 641 likewise be 642 unwept.</p>
<p>To the Queen</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Give me no help in lamentation,</p>
<p>I am not barren to 643 bring forth complaints 644 .</p>
<p>All springs reduce 645 their currents to mine eyes,</p>
<p>That I, being governed by the watery moon 646 ,</p>
<p>May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world.</p>
<p>Ah, for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!</p>
<p>CHILDREN Ah, for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH What stay 647 had I but Edward? And he’s gone.</p>
<p>CHILDREN What stay had we but Clarence? And he’s gone.</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK What stays had I but they? And they are gone.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Was never widow 648 had so dear 649 a loss.</p>
<p>CHILDREN Were never orphans had so dear a loss!</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Was never mother had so dear a loss.</p>
<p>Alas, I am the mother of these griefs!</p>
<p>Their woes are parcelled 650 , mine is general 651 .</p>
<p>She for an Edward weeps, and so do I:</p>
<p>I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:</p>
<p>These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I:</p>
<p>I for an Edward weep, so do not they.</p>
<p>Alas, you three, on me, threefold distressed,</p>
<p>Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow’s nurse 652 ,</p>
<p>And I will pamper 653 it with lamentation.</p>
<p>DORSET Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeased</p>
<p>To the Queen</p>
<p>That you take with unthankfulness, his doing.</p>
<p>In common worldly things, ’tis called ungrateful,</p>
<p>With dull 654 unwillingness to repay a debt</p>
<p>Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent,</p>
<p>Much more to be thus opposite 655 with heaven,</p>
<p>For it requires 656 the royal debt it lent you.</p>
<p>RIVERS Madam, bethink you, like a careful 657 mother</p>
<p>Of the young prince your son: send straight for him</p>
<p>Let him be crowned. In him your comfort lives.</p>
<p>Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward’s grave</p>
<p>And plant your joys in living Edward’s throne.</p>
<p>Enter Richard, Buckingham, [Stanley, Earl of ] Derby, Hastings and
Ratcliffe</p>
<p>RICHARD Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause</p>
<p>To the Queen</p>
<p>To wail the dimming of our shining star,</p>
<p>But none can help our harms by wailing them.—</p>
<p>Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy 658 :</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>I did not see your grace. Humbly on my knee</p>
<p>I crave your blessing.</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK God bless thee, and put meekness 659 in thy
breast,</p>
<p>Love, charity, obedience and true duty.</p>
<p>↓ Richard rises ↓</p>
<p>RICHARD Amen.— And make me die a good old man.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>That is the butt-end 660 of a mother’s blessing;</p>
<p>I marvel that her grace 661 did leave it out.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM You cloudy 662 princes and heart-sorrowing peers,</p>
<p>That bear this heavy mutual load of moan 663 ,</p>
<p>Now cheer each other in each other’s love.</p>
<p>Though we have spent our harvest of this king,</p>
<p>We are to reap the harvest of his son.</p>
<p>The broken rancour 664 of your high-swoll’n 665 hates,</p>
<p>But lately splintered 666 , knit, and joined together,</p>
<p>Must gently be preserved, cherished, and kept 667 .</p>
<p>Meseemeth 668 good, that, with some little train 669 ,</p>
<p>Forthwith 670 from Ludlow 671 the young prince be fet 672</p>
<p>Hither to London, to be crowned our king.</p>
<p>RIVERS Why with some little train, my lord of Buckingham?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude 673 ,</p>
<p>The new-healed wound of malice should break out,</p>
<p>Which would be so much the more dangerous</p>
<p>By how much the estate 674 is green 675 and yet ungoverned.</p>
<p>Where every horse bears his commanding rein,</p>
<p>And may direct his course as please himself 676 ,</p>
<p>As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent 677 ,</p>
<p>In my opinion, ought to be prevented.</p>
<p>RICHARD I hope the king made peace with 678 all of us,</p>
<p>And the compact 679 is firm and true in me.</p>
<p>RIVERS And so in me, and so, I think, in all.</p>
<p>Yet since it is but green 680 , it should be put</p>
<p>To no apparent 681 likelihood of breach 682 ,</p>
<p>Which haply 683 by much company might be urged 684 :</p>
<p>Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,</p>
<p>That it is meet 685 so few should fetch the prince.</p>
<p>HASTINGS And so say I.</p>
<p>RICHARD Then be it so, and go we to determine</p>
<p>Who they shall be that straight shall post 686 to Ludlow.</p>
<p>Madam, and you my sister, will you go</p>
<p>To give your censures 687 in this business?</p>
<p>Exeunt. Buckingham and Richard remain</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM My lord, whoever journeys to the prince,</p>
<p>For God’s sake, let not us two stay at home.</p>
<p>For by 688 the way I’ll sort occasion 689 ,</p>
<p>As index 690 to the story 691 we late 692 talked of,</p>
<p>To part the queen’s proud kindred from the prince.</p>
<p>RICHARD My other self, my counsel’s 693 consistory 694 ,</p>
<p>My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin,</p>
<p>I, as a child, will go by thy direction 695 .</p>
<p>Towards Ludlow then, for we’ll not stay behind.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
