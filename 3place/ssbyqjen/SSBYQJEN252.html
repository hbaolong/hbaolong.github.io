12</h4>
<p>Enter Count Rossillion [Bertram ] and the [two ] Frenchmen, as at
first</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Nay, good my lord, put him to’t 1136 , let him have his
way.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD If your lordship find him not a hilding 1137 , hold me no
more in your respect.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD On my life, my lord, a bubble 1138 .</p>
<p>BERTRAM Do you think I am so far deceived in him?</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
without any malice, but to speak of him as 1139 my kinsman, he’s a most
notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker,
the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship’s entertainment
1140 .</p>
<p>FIRST LORD It were fit you knew him, lest reposing 1141 too far in
his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty 1142
business in a main danger fail you.</p>
<p>BERTRAM I would I knew in what particular action to try 1143 him.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD None better than to let him fetch off 1144 his drum, which
you hear him so confidently undertake to do.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly surprise
1145 him; such I will have whom I am sure he knows not 1146 from the
enemy: we will bind and hoodwink 1147 him so, that he shall suppose no
other but that he is carried into the leaguer 1148 of the adversaries,
when we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at his
examination. If he do not, for the promise of his life and in the
highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the
intelligence 1149 in his power against you, and that with the divine
forfeit of his soul upon oath 1150 , never trust my judgement in
anything.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum. He
says he has a stratagem for’t. When your lordship sees the bottom 1151
of his success in’t, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore 1152
will be melted, if you give him not John Drum’s entertainment 1153 ,
your inclining 1154 cannot be removed. Here he comes.</p>
<p>Enter Parolles</p>
<p>SECOND LORD O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of his
design. Let him fetch off his drum in any hand 1155 .</p>
<p>Aside to Bertram</p>
<p>BERTRAM How now, monsieur? This drum sticks 1156 sorely in your
disposition 1157 .</p>
<p>FIRST LORD A pox 1158 on’t! Let it go, ’tis but a drum.</p>
<p>PAROLLES ‘But a drum’? Is’t ‘but a drum’? A drum so lost? There was
excellent command: to charge in with our horse upon our own wings 1159 ,
and to rend 1160 our own soldiers!</p>
<p>FIRST LORD That was not to be blamed in 1161 the command of the
service 1162 : it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not
have prevented if he had been there to command.</p>
<p>BERTRAM Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success. Some dishonour
we had in the loss of that drum, but it is not to be recovered.</p>
<p>PAROLLES It might have been recovered.</p>
<p>BERTRAM It might, but it is not now.</p>
<p>PAROLLES It is to be recovered. But 1163 that the merit of service is
seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that
drum or another, or hic jace t 1164 .</p>
<p>BERTRAM Why, if you have a stomach 1165 , to’t, monsieur: if you
think your mystery 1166 in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour
again into his 1167 native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and
go on. I will grace 1168 the attempt for a worthy exploit. If you speed
1169 well in it, the duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what
further becomes 1170 his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your
worthiness.</p>
<p>PAROLLES By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.</p>
<p>BERTRAM But you must not now slumber in it 1171 .</p>
<p>PAROLLES I’ll about it this evening, and I will presently 1172 pen
1173 down my dilemmas 1174 , encourage myself in my certainty, put
myself into my mortal preparation 1175 , and by midnight look to hear
further from me.</p>
<p>BERTRAM May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about
it?</p>
<p>PAROLLES I know not what the success will be, my lord, but the
attempt I vow.</p>
<p>BERTRAM I know thou’rt valiant, and to the possibility 1176 of thy
soldiership will subscribe 1177 for thee. Farewell.</p>
<p>PAROLLES I love not many words.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>SECOND LORD No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange
fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this business,
which he knows is not to be done, damns himself 1178 to do and dares
better be damned than to do’t?</p>
<p>FIRST LORD You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is that
he will steal himself into a man’s favour and for a week escape a great
deal of discoveries, but when you find him out, you have 1179 him ever
after.</p>
<p>BERTRAM Why, do you think he will make no deed 1180 at all of this
that so seriously he does address himself unto?</p>
<p>SECOND LORD None in the world. But return with an invention and clap
upon you two or three probable 1181 lies. But we have almost embossed
1182 him. You shall see his fall tonight; for 1183 indeed he is not for
your lordship’s respect.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD We’ll make you some sport with the fox ere we case 1184
him. He was first smoked 1185 by the old lord Lafew. When his disguise
and he is parted, tell me what a sprat 1186 you shall find him, which
you shall see this very night.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD I must go look my twigs 1187 . He shall be caught.</p>
<p>BERTRAM Your brother he shall go along with me 1188 .</p>
<p>To First Lord</p>
<p>FIRST LORD As’t please your lordship. I’ll leave you.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>BERTRAM Now will I lead you to the house, and show you</p>
<p>The lass I spoke of.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD But you say she’s honest.</p>
<p>BERTRAM That’s all the fault. I spoke with her but once</p>
<p>And found her wondrous cold, but I sent to her</p>
<p>By this same coxcomb 1189 that we have i’th’wind 1190</p>
<p>Tokens and letters which she did re-send.</p>
<p>And this is all I have done. She’s a fair creature.</p>
<p>Will you go see her?</p>
<p>SECOND LORD With all my heart, my lord.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
