continues</h4>
<p>Enter Antipholus of Ephesus, his man Dromio [of Ephesus ], Angelo the
goldsmith and Balthazar the merchant</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us
all,</p>
<p>My wife is shrewish 393 when I keep not hours 394 ;</p>
<p>Say that I lingered with you at your shop</p>
<p>To see the making of her carcanet 395 ,</p>
<p>And that tomorrow you will bring it home.</p>
<p>But here’s a villain that would face me down 396</p>
<p>He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,</p>
<p>And charged 397 him with a thousand marks in gold,</p>
<p>And that I did deny my wife and house.</p>
<p>Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know:</p>
<p>That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand 398 to show.</p>
<p>If the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink,</p>
<p>Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I think thou art an ass.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Marry, so it doth appear</p>
<p>By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.</p>
<p>I should kick, being kicked, and being at that pass 399 ,</p>
<p>You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS You’re sad 400 , Signior Balthazar. Pray God
our cheer 401</p>
<p>May answer 402 my good will and your good welcome here.</p>
<p>BALTHAZAR I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear 403
.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh 404 or
fish,</p>
<p>A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish 405 .</p>
<p>BALTHAZAR Good meat, sir, is common, that every churl 406
affords.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS And welcome more common, for that’s nothing but
words.</p>
<p>BALTHAZAR Small cheer 407 and great welcome makes a merry feast.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing 408
guest.</p>
<p>But though my cates 409 be mean 410 , take them in good part 411
,</p>
<p>Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.</p>
<p>Tries the door of his house</p>
<p>But soft 412 , my door is locked.— Go bid them let us in.</p>
<p>To Dromio</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicely, Gillian, Ginn 413
!</p>
<p>Calling</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Mome 414 , malt-horse 415 , capon 416 , coxcomb
417 , idiot, patch 418 ,</p>
<p>Speaks from the other side of the door</p>
<p>Either get thee from the door or sit down at the hatch 419 :</p>
<p>Dost thou conjure for wenches 420 , that thou call’st for such store
421 ,</p>
<p>When one is one too many 422 ? Go, get thee from the door.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS What patch is made our porter? My master stays 423
in the street.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Let him walk from 424 whence he came, lest he
catch cold on’s feet.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Who talks within there? Ho 425 , open the
door.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Right, sir, I’ll tell you when, an 426 you’ll tell
me wherefore.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Wherefore? For my dinner: I have not dined
today.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Nor today here you must not, come again when you
may.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS What art thou that keep’st me out from the
house I owe 427 ?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE The porter for this time, sir, and my name is
Dromio.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS O, villain, thou hast stol’n both mine office 428
and my name:</p>
<p>The one ne’er got me credit, the other mickle 429 blame.</p>
<p>If thou hadst been Dromio today in my place,</p>
<p>Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name, or thy name for an ass
430 .</p>
<p>Enter Luce [within or above, concealed from the others ]</p>
<p>LUCE What a coil 431 is there, Dromio? Who are those at the gate?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Let my master in, Luce.</p>
<p>LUCE Faith, no, he comes too late, and so tell your master.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS O lord, I must laugh.</p>
<p>Have at 432 you with a proverb — Shall I set in my staff 433 ?</p>
<p>LUCE Have at you with another, that’s — When? Can you tell 434 ?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE If thy name be called Luce — Luce, thou hast
answered him well.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Do you hear, you minion 435 , you’ll let us in,
I hope?</p>
<p>To Luce</p>
<p>LUCE I thought to have asked you.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE And you said no.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS So come, help.</p>
<p>They beat the door</p>
<p>Well struck, there was blow 436 for blow.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Thou baggage 437 , let me in.</p>
<p>To Luce</p>
<p>LUCE Can you tell for whose sake?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Master, knock 438 the door hard.</p>
<p>LUCE Let him knock till it ache.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS You’ll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door
down.</p>
<p>LUCE What needs all that, and a pair of stocks 439 in the town?
440</p>
<p>Enter Adriana</p>
<p>Within or above, concealed, like Luce</p>
<p>ADRIANA Who is that at the door that keeps 441 all this noise?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE By my troth, your town is troubled with unruly
boys 442 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Are you there, wife? You might have come
before.</p>
<p>ADRIANA Your wife, sir knave? Go, get you from the door.</p>
<p>[Exit with Luce ]</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS If you went in pain, master, this ‘knave’ would go
sore 443 .</p>
<p>ANGELO Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome. We would fain 444
have either.</p>
<p>BALTHAZAR In debating which was best, we shall part 445 with
neither.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS They stand at the door, master, bid them welcome
hither.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS There is something in the wind 446 , that we
cannot get in.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS You would say so, master, if your garments were
thin 447 .</p>
<p>Your cake 448 here is warm within: you stand 449 here in the
cold.</p>
<p>It would make a man mad as a buck 450 to be so bought and sold 451
.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Go fetch me something, I’ll break ope 452 the
gate.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Break any breaking 453 here, and I’ll break your
knave’s pate.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS A man may break a word 454 with you, sir, and words
are but wind:</p>
<p>Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind 455 .</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE It seems thou want’st breaking 456 . Out upon
thee, hind 457 !</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS Here’s too much ‘out upon thee!’ I pray thee let me
in.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no
fin 458 .</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Well, I’ll break in. Go borrow me a crow 459
.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?</p>
<p>For a fish without a fin, there’s a fowl without a feather,</p>
<p>If a crow help us in, sirrah 460 , we’ll pluck a crow 461
together.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Go get thee gone, fetch me an iron crow.</p>
<p>BALTHAZAR Have patience, sir, O, let it not be so!</p>
<p>Herein 462 you war against your reputation,</p>
<p>And draw within the compass of suspect 463</p>
<p>Th’unviolated honour of your wife.</p>
<p>Once this 464 , your long experience of her wisdom,</p>
<p>Her sober virtue, years and modesty,</p>
<p>Plead on her part some cause to you unknown 465 .</p>
<p>And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse 466</p>
<p>Why at this time the doors are made 467 against you.</p>
<p>Be ruled by me, depart in patience,</p>
<p>And let us to the Tiger 468 all to dinner,</p>
<p>And about 469 evening, come yourself alone</p>
<p>To know the reason of this strange restraint.</p>
<p>If by strong hand 470 you offer 471 to break in</p>
<p>Now in the stirring passage 472 of the day,</p>
<p>A vulgar comment 473 will be made of 474 it,</p>
<p>And that supposed 475 by the common rout 476</p>
<p>Against your yet ungalled 477 estimation 478 ,</p>
<p>That may with foul intrusion enter in,</p>
<p>And dwell upon your grave when you are dead,</p>
<p>For slander lives upon succession 479 ,</p>
<p>Forever housed 480 where it gets possession 481 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS You have prevailed. I will depart in quiet,</p>
<p>And in despite of mirth 482 mean to be merry 483 .</p>
<p>I know a wench of excellent discourse,</p>
<p>Pretty and witty, wild 484 , and yet, too, gentle 485 .</p>
<p>There will we dine. This woman that I mean,</p>
<p>My wife — but I protest 486 , without desert 487 —</p>
<p>Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal 488 .</p>
<p>To her will we to dinner.— Get you home</p>
<p>To Angelo</p>
<p>And fetch the chain, by this 489 I know ’tis made.</p>
<p>Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine 490 ,</p>
<p>For there’s the 491 house. That chain will I bestow —</p>
<p>Be it for nothing but to spite my wife —</p>
<p>Upon mine hostess there. Good sir, make haste.</p>
<p>Since mine own doors 492 refuse to entertain 493 me,</p>
<p>I’ll knock 494 elsewhere, to see if they’ll disdain me.</p>
<p>ANGELO I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Do so, this jest shall cost me some
expense.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
