<h4 id="scene-3-running-scene-6">Scene 3 / running scene 6</h4>
<p>Enter Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE There’s not a man I meet but doth salute 703
me</p>
<p>As if I were their well-acquainted friend,</p>
<p>And everyone doth call me by my name:</p>
<p>Some tender 704 money to me, some invite me,</p>
<p>Some other give me thanks for kindnesses,</p>
<p>Some offer me commodities to buy.</p>
<p>Even now a tailor called me in his shop,</p>
<p>And showed me silks that he had bought for me,</p>
<p>And therewithal took measure of my body.</p>
<p>Sure these are but imaginary wiles 705 ,</p>
<p>And Lapland 706 sorcerers inhabit here.</p>
<p>Enter Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p>With a purse</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Master, here’s the gold you sent me for. What,
have you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled 707 ?</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What gold is this? What Adam dost thou
mean?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Not that Adam that kept the Paradise 708 , but
that Adam that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf’s skin that
was killed for the Prodigal 709 , he that came behind you, sir, like an
evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I understand thee not.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No? Why, ’tis a plain case 710 : he that went like
a bass-viol in a case 711 of leather; the man, sir, that when gentlemen
are tired, gives them a sob 712 and ’rests 713 them. He, sir, that takes
pity on decayed 714 men and gives them suits of durance 715 . He that
sets up his rest 716 to do more exploits with his mace 717 than a
morris-pike 718 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What, thou mean’st an officer?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band 719 : he that
brings any man to answer it 720 that breaks his band 721 , one that
thinks a man always going to bed, and says, ‘God give you good rest
722’.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Well, sir, there rest 723 in your foolery. Is
there any ship puts forth tonight? May we be gone?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since, that
the bark Expedition put forth tonight, and then were you hindered by the
sergeant, to tarry for the hoy 724 Delay . Here are the angels 725 that
you sent for to deliver you.</p>
<p>Gives him the purse</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE The fellow is distract 726 , and so am I,</p>
<p>And here we wander in illusions.</p>
<p>Some blessèd power deliver us from hence!</p>
<p>Enter a Courtesan</p>
<p>COURTESAN Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.</p>
<p>I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now.</p>
<p>Is that the chain you promised me today?</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Satan avoid 727 , I charge thee tempt me
not.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Master, is this Mistress Satan?</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE It is the devil.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Nay, she is worse, she is the devil’s dam 728 :
and here she comes in the habit 729 of a light 730 wench, and thereof
comes that the wenches say ‘God damn me’, that’s as much to say, ‘God
make me a light wench’. It is written, they appear to men like angels of
light, light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn. Ergo, 731 light
wenches will burn 732 . Come not near her.</p>
<p>COURTESAN Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.</p>
<p>Will you go with me? We’ll mend 733 our dinner here 734 .</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat 735 , or
bespeak 736 a long spoon.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Why, Dromio?</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat
with the devil 737 .</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Avoid then, fiend, what 738 tell’st thou me of
supping?</p>
<p>To the Courtesan</p>
<p>Thou art, as you are all 739 , a sorceress.</p>
<p>I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.</p>
<p>COURTESAN Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,</p>
<p>Or, for 740 my diamond, the chain you promised,</p>
<p>And I’ll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Some devils ask 741 but the parings 742 of one’s
nail, a rush 743 , a hair, a drop of blood, a pin, a nut, a
cherry-stone. But she, more covetous, would have a chain. Master, be
wise, an if 744 you give it her, the devil will shake her chain and
fright us with it.</p>
<p>COURTESAN I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain.</p>
<p>I hope you do not mean to cheat me so?</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Avaunt 745 , thou witch. Come, Dromio, let us
go.</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE ‘Fly pride’, says the peacock 746 . Mistress, that
you know.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse ]</p>
<p>COURTESAN Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,</p>
<p>Else would he never so demean 747 himself.</p>
<p>A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,</p>
<p>And for the same he promised me a chain.</p>
<p>Both one and other he denies me now.</p>
<p>The reason that I gather he is mad,</p>
<p>Besides this present instance of his rage 748 ,</p>
<p>Is a mad tale he told today at dinner,</p>
<p>Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.</p>
<p>Belike 749 his wife, acquainted with his fits,</p>
<p>On purpose shut the doors against his way.</p>
<p>My way is now to hie home 750 to his house,</p>
<p>And tell his wife that, being lunatic,</p>
<p>He rushed into my house and took perforce 751</p>
<p>My ring away. This course I fittest choose 752 ,</p>
<p>For forty ducats is too much to lose.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
