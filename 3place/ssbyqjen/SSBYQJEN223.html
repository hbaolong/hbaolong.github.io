continues</h4>
<p>Enter Petruchio and his man Grumio 340</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Verona 341 , for a while I take my leave,</p>
<p>To see my friends in Padua; but of all 342</p>
<p>My best belovèd and approvèd friend,</p>
<p>Hortensio, and I trow 343 this is his house.</p>
<p>Here, sirrah Grumio, knock 344 , I say.</p>
<p>GRUMIO Knock, sir? Whom should I knock? Is there any man has rebused
345 your worship?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Villain 346 , I say, knock me 347 here soundly.</p>
<p>GRUMIO Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should
knock you here, sir?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Villain, I say, knock me at this gate 348</p>
<p>And rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate 349 .</p>
<p>GRUMIO My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,</p>
<p>And then I know after who comes by the worst 350 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Will it not be?</p>
<p>Faith, sirrah, an you’ll not knock, I’ll ring 351 it.</p>
<p>I’ll try how you can sol-fa 352 and sing it 353 .</p>
<p>He wrings him by the ears</p>
<p>GRUMIO Help, mistress 354 , help! My master is mad.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain.</p>
<p>Enter Hortensio</p>
<p>HORTENSIO How now? What’s the matter? My old friend Grumio and my
good friend Petruchio? How do you all 355 at Verona?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?</p>
<p>Con 356 tutto il cuore, ben trovato, may I say.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Alla 357 nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorata signor mio
Petruchio. Rise, Grumio, rise. We will compound 358 this quarrel.</p>
<p>GRUMIO Nay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he ’leges 359 in Latin 360 . If
this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service, look you, sir:
he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it fit for a
servant to use 361 his master so, being perhaps, for aught 362 I see,
two and thirty, a pip 363 out 364 ?</p>
<p>Whom would to God I had well knocked at first,</p>
<p>Then had not Grumio come by the worst.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,</p>
<p>I bade the rascal knock upon your gate</p>
<p>And could not get him for my heart 365 to do it.</p>
<p>GRUMIO Knock at the gate? O heavens! Spake you not these words plain,
‘Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me
soundly’? And come you now with, ‘knocking at the gate’?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Petruchio, patience. I am Grumio’s pledge 366 .</p>
<p>Why, this’ 367 a heavy chance 368 ’twixt him and you,</p>
<p>Your ancient 369 , trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.</p>
<p>And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy 370 gale</p>
<p>Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Such wind as scatters young men through the world,</p>
<p>To seek their fortunes further than at home</p>
<p>Where small experience grows. But in a few 371 ,</p>
<p>Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:</p>
<p>Antonio, my father, is deceased,</p>
<p>And I have thrust myself into this maze,</p>
<p>Happily to wive 372 and thrive as best I may.</p>
<p>Crowns 373 in my purse I have and goods at home,</p>
<p>And so am come abroad to see the world.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Petruchio, shall I then come roundly 374 to thee</p>
<p>And wish 375 thee to a shrewd ill-favoured 376 wife?</p>
<p>Thou’ldst 377 thank me but a little for my counsel.</p>
<p>And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich,</p>
<p>And very rich. But thou’rt too much my friend,</p>
<p>And I’ll not wish thee to her.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Signior Hortensio, ’twixt such friends as we</p>
<p>Few words suffice: and therefore, if thou know</p>
<p>One rich enough to be Petruchio’s wife —</p>
<p>As wealth is burden 378 of my wooing dance —</p>
<p>Be she as foul as was Florentius’ love 379 ,</p>
<p>As old as Sibyl 380 and as curst and shrewd</p>
<p>As Socrates’ Xanthippe 381 , or a worse,</p>
<p>She moves me not 382 , or not removes, at least,</p>
<p>Affection’s edge in me 383 , were she as rough</p>
<p>As are the swelling Adriatic seas.</p>
<p>I come to wive it wealthily in Padua,</p>
<p>If wealthily, then happily in Padua.</p>
<p>GRUMIO Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind 384 is.
Why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby 385
; or an old trot 386 with ne’er a tooth in her head, though she have as
many diseases as two and fifty horses. Why, nothing comes amiss, so
money comes withal 387 .</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Petruchio, since we are stepped thus far in 388 ,</p>
<p>I will continue that I broached 389 in jest.</p>
<p>I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife</p>
<p>With wealth enough and young and beauteous,</p>
<p>Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman.</p>
<p>Her only fault, and that is faults enough,</p>
<p>Is that she is intolerable 390 curst</p>
<p>And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure</p>
<p>That, were my state 391 far worser than it is,</p>
<p>I would not wed her for a mine of gold.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Hortensio, peace! Thou know’st not gold’s effect.</p>
<p>Tell me her father’s name and ’tis enough,</p>
<p>For I will board 392 her, though she chide as loud</p>
<p>As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack 393 .</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Her father is Baptista Minola,</p>
<p>An affable and courteous gentleman.</p>
<p>Her name is Katherina Minola,</p>
<p>Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO I know her father, though I know not her,</p>
<p>And he knew my deceasèd father well.</p>
<p>I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her,</p>
<p>And therefore let me be thus bold with you</p>
<p>To give you over 394 at this first encounter,</p>
<p>Unless you will accompany me thither.</p>
<p>GRUMIO I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour 395 lasts. O’ 396
my word, an 397 she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding
would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a score 398
knaves or so. Why, that’s nothing; an he begin once, he’ll rail 399 in
his rope-tricks 400 . I’ll tell you what, sir, an she stand 401 him but
a little, he will throw a figure 402 in her face and so disfigure her
with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal 403 than a cat.
You know him not, sir.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,</p>
<p>For in Baptista’s keep 404 my treasure 405 is:</p>
<p>He hath the jewel of my life in hold 406 ,</p>
<p>His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,</p>
<p>And her withholds from me and other more 407 ,</p>
<p>Suitors to her and rivals in my love,</p>
<p>Supposing it a thing impossible,</p>
<p>For those defects 408 I have before rehearsed 409 ,</p>
<p>That ever Katherina will be wooed:</p>
<p>Therefore this order 410 hath Baptista ta’en,</p>
<p>That none shall have access unto Bianca</p>
<p>Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.</p>
<p>GRUMIO Katherine the curst!</p>
<p>A title for a maid of all titles the worst.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace 411 ,</p>
<p>And offer me disguised in sober robes</p>
<p>To old Baptista as a schoolmaster</p>
<p>Well seen 412 in music, to instruct Bianca,</p>
<p>That so I may by this device at least</p>
<p>Have leave and leisure to make love to 413 her</p>
<p>And unsuspected court her by herself.</p>
<p>Enter Gremio and Lucentio disguised</p>
<p>GRUMIO Here’s no knavery! 414 See, to beguile 415 the old folks, how
the young folks lay their heads together! Master, master, look about
you. Who goes there, ha?</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Peace, Grumio, it is the rival of my love.</p>
<p>Petruchio, stand by a while.</p>
<p>They stand aside</p>
<p>GRUMIO A proper stripling 416 and an amorous!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>GREMIO O, very well, I have perused the note 417 .</p>
<p>To Lucentio</p>
<p>Hark you, sir, I’ll have them very fairly 418 419 bound —</p>
<p>All books of love, see that at any hand —</p>
<p>And see you read no other lectures 420 to her.</p>
<p>You understand me. Over and beside</p>
<p>Signior Baptista’s liberality 421 ,</p>
<p>I’ll mend it with a largesse 422 . Take your paper too,</p>
<p>Gives Lucentio the note</p>
<p>And let me have them 423 very well perfumed,</p>
<p>For she is sweeter than perfume itself</p>
<p>To whom they go to. What will you read to her?</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Whate’er I read to her, I’ll plead for you</p>
<p>As for my patron, stand you so assured,</p>
<p>As firmly as yourself were still in place 424 —</p>
<p>Yea, and perhaps with more successful words</p>
<p>Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.</p>
<p>GREMIO O, this learning, what a thing it is!</p>
<p>GRUMIO O, this woodcock 425 , what an ass it is!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Peace, sirrah!</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Grumio, mum.— God save you, Signior Gremio.</p>
<p>GREMIO And you are well met 426 , Signior Hortensio.</p>
<p>Trow you 427 whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.</p>
<p>I promised to inquire carefully</p>
<p>About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca,</p>
<p>And by good fortune I have lighted well</p>
<p>On this young man, for learning and behaviour</p>
<p>Fit for her turn 428 , well read in poetry</p>
<p>And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO ’Tis well. And I have met a gentleman</p>
<p>Hath promised me to help me to 429 another,</p>
<p>A fine musician to instruct our mistress.</p>
<p>So shall I no whit be behind in duty</p>
<p>To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.</p>
<p>GREMIO Beloved of me, and that my deeds shall prove.</p>
<p>GRUMIO And that his bags 430 shall prove.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Gremio, ’tis now no time to vent 431 our love.</p>
<p>Listen to me, and if you speak me fair 432 ,</p>
<p>I’ll tell you news indifferent good for either 433 .</p>
<p>Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,</p>
<p>Upon agreement from us to his liking 434 ,</p>
<p>Will undertake to woo curst Katherine,</p>
<p>Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.</p>
<p>GREMIO So said, so done, is well 435 .</p>
<p>Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO I know she is an irksome brawling scold:</p>
<p>If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.</p>
<p>GREMIO No, say’st me so, friend? What countryman? 436</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Born in Verona, old Antonio’s son.</p>
<p>My father dead, my fortune lives for me,</p>
<p>And I do hope good days and long to see.</p>
<p>GREMIO O sir, such a life with such a wife were strange.</p>
<p>But if you have a stomach 437 , to’t 438 a’ God’s name.</p>
<p>You shall have me assisting you in all.</p>
<p>But will you woo this wild-cat?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Will I live? 439</p>
<p>GRUMIO Will he woo her? Ay, or I’ll hang her.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Why came I hither but to that intent?</p>
<p>Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?</p>
<p>Have I not in my time heard lions roar?</p>
<p>Have I not heard the sea, puffed up with winds,</p>
<p>Rage like an angry boar chafèd 440 with sweat?</p>
<p>Have I not heard great ordnance 441 in the field,</p>
<p>And heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies?</p>
<p>Have I not in a pitchèd 442 battle heard</p>
<p>Loud ‘larums 443 , neighing steeds, and trumpets’ clang?</p>
<p>And do you tell me of a woman’s tongue,</p>
<p>That gives not half so great a blow to hear</p>
<p>As will a chestnut in a farmer’s fire 444 ?</p>
<p>Tush, tush! Fear 445 boys with bugs 446 .</p>
<p>GRUMIO For he fears none.</p>
<p>GREMIO Hortensio, hark:</p>
<p>This gentleman is happily arrived,</p>
<p>My mind presumes, for his own good and yours.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO I promised we would be contributors</p>
<p>And bear his charge 447 of wooing whatsoe’er.</p>
<p>GREMIO And so we will, provided that he win her.</p>
<p>GRUMIO I would I were as sure of a good dinner.</p>
<p>Enter Tranio brave 448 [disguised as Lucentio ] and Biondello</p>
<p>TRANIO Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,</p>
<p>Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest 449 way</p>
<p>To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?</p>
<p>BIONDELLO He that has the two fair daughters, is’t he you mean?</p>
<p>TRANIO Even he, Biondello.</p>
<p>GREMIO Hark you, sir, you mean not her to— 450</p>
<p>TRANIO Perhaps, him and her, sir. What have you to do? 451</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.</p>
<p>TRANIO I love no chiders 452 , sir. Biondello, let’s away.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Well begun 453 , Tranio.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Sir, a word ere 454 you go:</p>
<p>Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?</p>
<p>TRANIO And if I be, sir, is it any offence?</p>
<p>GREMIO No, if without more words you will get you hence.</p>
<p>TRANIO Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free</p>
<p>For me as for you?</p>
<p>GREMIO But so is not she.</p>
<p>TRANIO For what reason, I beseech you?</p>
<p>GREMIO For this reason, if you’ll know,</p>
<p>That she’s the choice 455 love of Signior Gremio.</p>
<p>HORTENSIO That she’s the chosen of Signior Hortensio.</p>
<p>TRANIO Softly, my masters. If you be gentlemen,</p>
<p>Do me this right: hear me with patience.</p>
<p>Baptista is a noble gentleman,</p>
<p>To whom my father is not all 456 unknown,</p>
<p>And were his daughter fairer than she is,</p>
<p>She may more suitors have, and me for one.</p>
<p>Fair Leda’s daughter 457 had a thousand wooers,</p>
<p>Then well one more may fair Bianca have,</p>
<p>And so she shall. Lucentio shall make one,</p>
<p>Though 458 Paris 459 came in hope to speed alone 460 .</p>
<p>GREMIO What, this gentleman will out-talk us all.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Sir, give him head 461 . I know he’ll prove a jade 462 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Hortensio, to what end are all these words?</p>
<p>HORTENSIO Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,</p>
<p>Did you yet ever see Baptista’s daughter?</p>
<p>TRANIO No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two:</p>
<p>The one as famous for a scolding tongue</p>
<p>As is the other for beauteous modesty.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Sir, sir, the first’s for me, let her go by 463 .</p>
<p>GREMIO Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,</p>
<p>And let it be 464 more than Alcides’ twelve 465 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth 466 :</p>
<p>The youngest daughter whom you hearken for 467 ,</p>
<p>Her father keeps from all access of suitors,</p>
<p>And will not promise her to any man</p>
<p>Until the elder sister first be wed.</p>
<p>The younger then is free, and not before.</p>
<p>TRANIO If it be so, sir, that you are the man</p>
<p>Must stead 468 us all and me amongst the rest,</p>
<p>And if you break the ice and do this feat,</p>
<p>Achieve the elder, set the younger free</p>
<p>For our access, whose hap 469 shall be to have her</p>
