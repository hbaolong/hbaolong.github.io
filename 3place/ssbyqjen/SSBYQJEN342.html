<h4 id="scene-3-212-running-scene-3">Scene 3 212 / running scene 3</h4>
<p>Enter Volumnia and Virgilia, mother and wife to Martius: they set
them down on two low stools and sew</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more
comfortable 213 sort 214 : if my son were my husband, I should freelier
215 rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the
embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet he was
but tender-bodied 216 and the only son of my womb, when youth with
comeliness 217 plucked all gaze his way, when for a day of
kings’entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her
beholding, I, considering how honour would become 218 such a person 219
, that it was no better than, picture-like, to hang by th’wall 220 if
renown 221 made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek danger where he
was like 222 to find fame: to a cruel war I sent him, from whence he
returned, his brows bound with oak 223 . I tell thee, daughter, I sprang
not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now 224 in
first seeing he had proved himself a man.</p>
<p>VIRGILIA But had he died in the business, madam, how then?</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA Then his good report should have been my son: I therein
would have found issue 225 . Hear me profess sincerely: had I a dozen
sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my good
Martius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one
voluptuously surfeit 226 out of action.</p>
<p>Enter a Gentlewoman</p>
<p>GENTLEWOMAN Madam, the lady Valeria is come to visit you.</p>
<p>To Volumnia</p>
<p>VIRGILIA Beseech you give me leave to retire myself 227 .</p>
<p>To Volumnia</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA Indeed, you shall not.</p>
<p>Methinks I hear hither 228 your husband’s drum:</p>
<p>See 229 him pluck Aufidius down by th’hair,</p>
<p>As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:</p>
<p>Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus,</p>
<p>’Come on, you cowards, you were got 230 in fear,</p>
<p>Though you were born in Rome’; his bloody brow</p>
<p>With his mailed 231 hand then wiping, forth he goes,</p>
<p>Like to a harvest-man that’s tasked 232 to mow</p>
<p>Or 233 all or lose his hire 234 .</p>
<p>VIRGILIA His bloody brow? O Jupiter 235 , no blood!</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA Away, you fool! It more becomes a man</p>
<p>Than gilt his trophy 236 . The breasts of Hecuba 237</p>
<p>When she did suckle Hector looked not lovelier</p>
<p>Than Hector’s forehead when it spit forth blood</p>
<p>At Grecian sword, contemning 238 .— Tell Valeria,</p>
<p>To the Gentlewoman</p>
<p>We are fit 239 to bid her welcome.</p>
<p>Exit Gentlewoman</p>
<p>VIRGILIA Heavens bless 240 my lord from fell 241 Aufidius!</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA He’ll beat Aufidius’ head below his knee</p>
<p>And tread upon his neck.</p>
<p>Enter Valeria with an Usher 242 and a Gentlewoman</p>
<p>VALERIA My ladies both, good day to you.</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA Sweet madam.</p>
<p>VIRGILIA I am glad to see your ladyship.</p>
<p>VALERIA How do you both? You are manifest housekeepers 243 . What are
you sewing here? A fine spot 244 , in good faith. How does your little
son?</p>
<p>VIRGILIA I thank your ladyship: well, good madam.</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon
his schoolmaster.</p>
<p>VALERIA O’my 245 word, the father’s son: I’ll swear ’tis a very
pretty boy. O’my troth 246 , I looked upon him o’Wednesday half an hour
together 247 : he’s 248 such a confirmed 249 countenance. I saw him run
after 250 a gilded butterfly, and when he caught it, he let it go again,
and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up again, catched it
again: or whether 251 his fall enraged him, or how ’twas, he did so set
252 his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant 253 how he mammocked 254 it!</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA One on’s 255 father’s moods.</p>
<p>VALERIA Indeed, la 256 , ’tis a noble child.</p>
<p>VIRGILIA A crack 257 , madam.</p>
<p>VALERIA Come, lay aside your stitchery, I must have you play the idle
housewife 258 with me this afternoon.</p>
<p>VIRGILIA No, good madam, I will not out 259 of doors.</p>
<p>VALERIA Not out of doors?</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA She shall, she shall.</p>
<p>VIRGILIA Indeed, no, by your patience: I’ll not over the threshold
till my lord return from the wars.</p>
<p>VALERIA Fie 260 , you confine yourself most unreasonably: come, you
must go visit the good lady that lies in 261 .</p>
<p>VIRGILIA I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my
prayers: but I cannot go thither.</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA Why, I pray you?</p>
<p>VIRGILIA ’Tis not to save labour, nor that I want 262 love.</p>
<p>VALERIA You would 263 be another Penelope 264 : yet they say all the
yarn she spun in Ulysses’ absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
Come, I would your cambric 265 were sensible 266 as your finger, that
you might leave 267 pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with
us.</p>
<p>VIRGILIA No, good madam, pardon me, indeed I will not forth.</p>
<p>VALERIA In truth, la, go with me, and I’ll tell you excellent news of
your husband.</p>
<p>VIRGILIA O, good madam, there can be none yet.</p>
<p>VALERIA Verily 268 I do not jest with you: there came news from him
last night.</p>
<p>VIRGILIA Indeed, madam?</p>
<p>VALERIA In earnest, it’s true: I heard a senator speak it. Thus it
is: the Volsces have an army forth, against whom Cominius the general is
gone, with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and Titus Lartius are
set down before their city Corioles: they nothing 269 doubt prevailing
and to make it brief wars. This is true, on mine honour: and so, I pray,
go with us.</p>
<p>VIRGILIA Give me excuse 270 , good madam: I will obey you in
everything hereafter.</p>
<p>VOLUMNIA Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but disease our
better mirth 271 .</p>
<p>VALERIA In troth 272 , I think she would. Fare you well, then. Come,
good sweet lady.</p>
<p>Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out o’door, and go along with
us.</p>
<p>VIRGILIA No, at a word 273 , madam: indeed, I must not. I wish you
much mirth.</p>
<p>VALERIA Well then, farewell.</p>
<p>Exeunt Ladies</p>
