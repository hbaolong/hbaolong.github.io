11</h4>
<p>Enter King, Warwick, Clarence, Gloucester</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Now, lords, if heaven doth give successful end</p>
<p>To this debate 1390 that bleedeth at our doors,</p>
<p>We will our youth lead on to higher fields 1391</p>
<p>And draw no swords but what are sanctified 1392 .</p>
<p>Our navy is addressed 1393 , our power collected,</p>
<p>Our substitutes in absence well invested 1394 ,</p>
<p>And everything lies level 1395 to our wish;</p>
<p>Only we want 1396 a little personal strength,</p>
<p>And pause us 1397 , till these rebels, now afoot,</p>
<p>Come underneath the yoke of government.</p>
<p>WARWICK Both which we doubt not but your majesty</p>
<p>Shall soon enjoy.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,</p>
<p>Where is the prince your brother?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER I think he’s gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV And how accompanied?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER I do not know, my lord.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER No, my good lord, he is in presence 1398 here.</p>
<p>CLARENCE What would my lord and father?</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.</p>
<p>How chance 1399 thou art not with the prince thy brother?</p>
<p>He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas.</p>
<p>Thou hast a better place in his affection</p>
<p>Than all thy brothers. Cherish it, my boy,</p>
<p>And noble offices 1400 thou mayst effect</p>
<p>Of mediation, after I am dead,</p>
<p>Between his greatness and thy other brethren 1401 :</p>
<p>Therefore omit 1402 him not, blunt not his love,</p>
<p>Nor lose the good advantage of his grace</p>
<p>By seeming cold or careless of his will,</p>
<p>For he is gracious, if he be observed 1403 .</p>
<p>He hath a tear for pity and a hand</p>
<p>Open as day for melting 1404 charity:</p>
<p>Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he’s flint 1405 ,</p>
<p>As humorous 1406 as winter, and as sudden</p>
<p>As flaws congealèd 1407 in the spring 1408 of day.</p>
<p>His temper 1409 , therefore, must be well observed:</p>
<p>Chide him for faults, and do it reverently 1410 ,</p>
<p>When you perceive his blood incline 1411 d to mirth,</p>
<p>But being moody, give him line and scope,</p>
<p>Till that his passions, like a whale on ground 1412 ,</p>
<p>Confound 1413 themselves with working 1414 . Learn this, Thomas,</p>
<p>And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,</p>
<p>A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,</p>
<p>That the united vessel of their blood,</p>
<p>Mingled with venom of suggestion 1415 —</p>
<p>As, force perforce 1416 , the age will pour it in —</p>
<p>Shall never leak, though it do work as strong</p>
<p>As aconitum 1417 or rash 1418 gunpowder.</p>
<p>CLARENCE I shall observe him with all care and love.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?</p>
<p>CLARENCE He is not there today. He dines in London.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV And how accompanied? Canst thou tell that?</p>
<p>CLARENCE With Poins, and other his continual 1419 followers.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Most subject is the fattest 1420 soil to weeds,</p>
<p>And he, the noble image of my youth,</p>
<p>Is overspread with them: therefore my grief</p>
<p>Stretches itself beyond the hour of death.</p>
<p>The blood weeps from my heart 1421 when I do shape</p>
<p>In forms imaginary th’unguided days</p>
<p>And rotten times that you shall look upon</p>
<p>When I am sleeping with my ancestors.</p>
<p>For when his headstrong riot hath no curb 1422 ,</p>
<p>When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,</p>
<p>When means and lavish 1423 manners meet together,</p>
<p>O, with what wings shall his affections fly</p>
<p>Towards fronting 1424 peril and opposed 1425 decay!</p>
<p>WARWICK My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite 1426 :</p>
<p>The prince but studies his companions</p>
<p>Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,</p>
<p>’Tis needful that the most immodest word</p>
<p>Be looked upon and learned, which once attained,</p>
<p>Your highness knows, comes to no further use</p>
<p>But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,</p>
<p>The prince will, in the perfectness 1427 of time,</p>
<p>Cast off his followers, and their memory</p>
<p>Shall as a pattern or a measure 1428 live,</p>
<p>By which his grace must mete 1429 the lives of others,</p>
<p>Turning past evils to advantages.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV ’Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb</p>
<p>In the dead carrion 1430 .</p>
<p>Enter Westmorland</p>
<p>Who’s here? Westmorland?</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND Health to my sovereign, and new happiness</p>
<p>Added to that that I am to deliver!</p>
<p>Prince John, your son, doth kiss your grace’s hand.</p>
<p>Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop 1431 , Hastings and all</p>
<p>Are brought to the correction of your law.</p>
<p>There is not now a rebel’s sword unsheathed,</p>
<p>But peace puts forth her olive everywhere.</p>
<p>The manner how this action hath been borne 1432</p>
<p>Here at more leisure may your highness read,</p>
<p>Gives a paper</p>
<p>With every course in his particular 1433 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV O Westmorland, thou art a summer bird,</p>
<p>Which ever in the haunch 1434 of winter sings</p>
<p>The lifting up 1435 of day.</p>
<p>Enter Harcourt</p>
<p>Look, here’s more news.</p>
<p>HARCOURT From enemies heaven keep your majesty,</p>
<p>And when they stand against you, may they fall</p>
<p>As those that I am come to tell you of.</p>
<p>The Earl Northumberland and the lord Bardolph,</p>
<p>With a great power of English and of Scots</p>
<p>Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown:</p>
<p>The manner and true order of the fight</p>
<p>This packet 1436 , please it you, contains at large.</p>
<p>Gives papers</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV And wherefore should these good news make me sick?</p>
<p>Will fortune never come with both hands full,</p>
<p>But write her fair words still in foulest letters?</p>
<p>She either gives a stomach 1437 and no food —</p>
<p>Such are the poor, in health — or else a feast</p>
<p>And takes away the stomach — such are the rich,</p>
<p>That have abundance and enjoy it not.</p>
<p>I should rejoice now at this happy news,</p>
<p>And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy.</p>
<p>O, me! Come near me, now I am much ill.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Comfort, your majesty!</p>
<p>CLARENCE O my royal father!</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.</p>
<p>WARWICK Be patient, princes. You do know these fits</p>
<p>Are with his highness very ordinary.</p>
<p>Stand from him. Give him air. He’ll straight 1438 be well.</p>
<p>CLARENCE No, no, he cannot long hold out: these pangs 1439 ,</p>
<p>Th’incessant care and labour of his mind,</p>
<p>Hath wrought the mure 1440 that should confine it in</p>
<p>So thin that life looks through and will break out.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER The people fear me 1441 , for they do observe</p>
<p>Unfathered heirs 1442 and loathly births 1443 of nature:</p>
<p>The seasons change their manners 1444 , as 1445 the year</p>
<p>Had found some months asleep and leaped them over.</p>
<p>CLARENCE The river hath thrice flowed 1446 , no ebb between,</p>
<p>And the old folk, time’s doting 1447 chronicles,</p>
<p>Say it did so a little time before</p>
<p>That our great-grandsire, Edward 1448 , sicked 1449 and died.</p>
<p>WARWICK Speak lower, princes, for the king recovers.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER This apoplexy 1450 will certain be his end.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV I pray you take me up and bear me hence</p>
<p>Into some other chamber. Softly, pray.</p>
<p>Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends,</p>
<p>Unless some dull 1451 and favourable 1452 hand</p>
<p>Will whisper music to my weary spirit.</p>
<p>WARWICK Call for the music in the other room.</p>
<p>To Servant</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Set me the crown upon my pillow here.</p>
<p>Crown is set on the pillow</p>
<p>CLARENCE His eye is hollow, and he changes much.</p>
<p>WARWICK Less noise, less noise!</p>
<p>Enter Prince Henry</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Who saw the Duke of Clarence?</p>
<p>CLARENCE I am here, brother, full of heaviness 1453 .</p>
<p>Weeps</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY How now? Rain 1454 within doors, and none abroad 1455
?</p>
<p>How doth the king?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Exceeding ill.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Heard he the good news yet?</p>
<p>Tell it him.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER He altered much upon the hearing it.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY If he be sick with joy, he’ll recover without physic
1456 .</p>
<p>WARWICK Not so much noise, my lords.— Sweet prince, speak low,</p>
<p>The king your father is disposed to sleep.</p>
<p>CLARENCE Let us withdraw into the other room.</p>
<p>WARWICK Will’t please your grace to go along with us?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY No, I will sit and watch here by the king.</p>
<p>[Exeunt all but Prince Henry ]</p>
<p>Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,</p>
<p>Being so troublesome a bedfellow?</p>
<p>O polished perturbation 1457 ! Golden care 1458 !</p>
<p>That keep’st the ports 1459 of slumber open wide</p>
<p>To many a watchful 1460 night! Sleep with it now,</p>
<p>Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet</p>
<p>As he whose brow with homely biggen 1461 bound</p>
<p>Snores out the watch 1462 of night. O majesty!</p>
<p>When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit</p>
<p>Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,</p>
<p>That scald’st with safety 1463 . By his gates of breath 1464</p>
<p>There lies a downy feather which stirs not:</p>
<p>Did he suspire 1465 , that light and weightless down</p>
<p>Perforce must move. My gracious lord, my father,</p>
<p>This sleep is sound indeed. This is a sleep</p>
<p>That from this golden rigol 1466 hath divorced</p>
<p>So many English kings. Thy due from me</p>
<p>Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,</p>
<p>Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,</p>
<p>Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously.</p>
<p>My due from thee is this imperial crown,</p>
<p>Which, as immediate 1467 from thy place and blood,</p>
<p>Derives itself 1468 to me. Lo, here it sits,</p>
<p>Puts crown on his head</p>
<p>Which heaven shall guard. And put the world’s whole strength 1469</p>
<p>Into one giant arm, it shall not force</p>
<p>This lineal 1470 honour from me. This from thee</p>
<p>Will I to mine 1471 leave, as ’tis left to me.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!</p>
<p>Waking</p>
<p>Enter Warwick, Gloucester, Clarence</p>
<p>CLARENCE Doth the king call?</p>
<p>WARWICK What would your majesty? How fares your grace?</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?</p>
<p>CLARENCE We left the prince my brother here, my liege,</p>
<p>Who undertook to sit and watch by you.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV The Prince of Wales? Where is he? Let me see him.</p>
<p>WARWICK This door is open. He is gone this way.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER He came not through the chamber where we stayed.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Where is the crown? Who took it from my pillow?</p>
<p>WARWICK When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV The prince hath ta’en it hence. Go, seek him out.</p>
<p>Is he so hasty that he doth suppose</p>
<p>My sleep my death?</p>
<p>Find him, my lord of Warwick. Chide 1472 him hither.</p>
<p>[Exit Warwick ]</p>
<p>This part 1473 of his conjoins 1474 with my disease</p>
<p>And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are,</p>
<p>How quickly nature falls into revolt 1475</p>
<p>When gold becomes her object!</p>
<p>For this the foolish over-careful fathers</p>
<p>Have broke their sleeps with thoughts, their brains with care,</p>
<p>Their bones with industry,</p>
<p>For this they have engrossed 1476 and pilèd up</p>
<p>The cankered 1477 heaps of strange-achievèd 1478 gold.</p>
<p>For this they have been thoughtful 1479 to invest 1480</p>
<p>Their sons with arts 1481 and martial exercises.</p>
<p>When, like the bee, culling from every flower</p>
<p>The virtuous sweets,</p>
<p>Our thighs packed with wax 1482 , our mouths with honey,</p>
<p>We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees,</p>
<p>Are murdered for our pains 1483 . This bitter taste</p>
<p>Yields his engrossments 1484 to the ending 1485 father.</p>
<p>Enter Warwick</p>
<p>Now, where is he that will not stay 1486 so long</p>
<p>Till his friend sickness hath determined 1487 me?</p>
<p>WARWICK My lord, I found the prince in the next room,</p>
<p>Washing with kindly 1488 tears his gentle 1489 cheeks,</p>
<p>With such a deep demeanour in great sorrow</p>
<p>That tyranny 1490 , which never quaffed but 1491 blood,</p>
<p>Would, by beholding him, have washed his knife</p>
<p>With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV But wherefore did he take away the crown?</p>
<p>Enter Prince Henry [with the crown ]</p>
<p>Lo, where he comes.— Come hither to me, Harry.—</p>
<p>Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Warwick, Gloucester, Clarence ]</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I never thought to hear you speak again.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:</p>
<p>I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.</p>
<p>Dost thou so hunger for my empty chair 1492</p>
<p>That thou wilt needs invest thee with mine honours</p>
<p>Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!</p>
<p>Thou seek’st the greatness that will o’erwhelm thee.</p>
<p>Stay but a little, for my cloud of dignity 1493</p>
<p>Is held from falling with so weak a wind</p>
<p>That it will quickly drop. My day is dim.</p>
<p>Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours</p>
<p>Were 1494 thine without offence, and at my death</p>
<p>Thou hast sealed up my expectation 1495 .</p>
<p>Thy life did manifest 1496 thou lovedst me not,</p>
<p>And thou wilt have me die assured of it.</p>
<p>Thou hid’st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,</p>
<p>Which thou hast whetted 1497 on thy stony heart,</p>
<p>To stab at half an hour of my life.</p>
<p>What? Canst thou not forbear 1498 me half an hour?</p>
<p>Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,</p>
<p>And bid the merry bells ring to thy ear</p>
<p>That thou art crownèd, not that I am dead.</p>
<p>Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse</p>
<p>Be drops of balm 1499 to sanctify 1500 thy head,</p>
<p>Only compound 1501 me with forgotten dust.</p>
<p>Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.</p>
<p>Pluck down my officers, break my decrees,</p>
<p>For now a time is come to mock at form 1502 .</p>
<p>Henry the Fifth is crowned. Up, vanity,</p>
<p>Down, royal state, all you sage counsellors, hence!</p>
<p>And to the English court assemble now,</p>
<p>From ev’ry region, apes of idleness 1503 !</p>
<p>Now, neighbour confines 1504 , purge you of your scum:</p>
<p>Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,</p>
<p>Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit</p>
<p>The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?</p>
<p>Be happy, he will trouble you no more.</p>
<p>England shall double gild 1505 his treble guilt.</p>
<p>England shall give him office 1506 , honour, might,</p>
<p>For the fifth Harry from curbèd licence plucks</p>
<p>The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog</p>
<p>Shall flesh his tooth 1507 in every innocent.</p>
<p>O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!</p>
<p>When that my care 1508 could not withhold thy riots,</p>
<p>What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?</p>
<p>O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,</p>
<p>Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY O, pardon me, my liege! But for my tears,</p>
<p>The moist impediments unto my speech,</p>
<p>I had 1509 forestalled this dear 1510 and deep rebuke</p>
<p>Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard</p>
<p>The course of it so far. There is your crown,</p>
<p>Puts it back on the pillow</p>
<p>And he that wears the crown immortally</p>
<p>Long guard it yours. If I affect 1511 it more</p>
<p>Than as your honour and as your renown,</p>
<p>Let me no more from this obedience 1512 rise,</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>Which my most true and inward duteous spirit</p>
<p>Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.</p>
<p>Heaven witness with me, when I here came in,</p>
<p>And found no course 1513 of breath within your majesty,</p>
<p>How cold it struck my heart. If I do feign,</p>
<p>O, let me in my present wildness die</p>
<p>And never live to show th’incredulous world</p>
<p>The noble change that I have purposèd 1514 .</p>
<p>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,</p>
<p>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,</p>
<p>I spake unto the crown as having sense 1515 ,</p>
<p>And thus upbraided it: ’The care on thee depending 1516</p>
<p>Hath fed upon the body of my father:</p>
<p>Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold.</p>
<p>Other, less fine in carat 1517 , is more precious,</p>
<p>Preserving life in med’cine potable 1518 ,</p>
<p>But thou, most fine 1519 , most honoured, most renowned,</p>
<p>Hast eat the bearer up.’ Thus, my royal liege,</p>
<p>Accusing it, I put it on my head,</p>
<p>To try 1520 with it, as with an enemy</p>
<p>That had before my face murdered my father,</p>
<p>The quarrel of a true inheritor.</p>
<p>But if it did infect my blood with joy,</p>
<p>Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride,</p>
<p>If any rebel or vain spirit of mine</p>
<p>Did with the least affection 1521 of a welcome</p>
<p>Give entertainment to 1522 the might 1523 of it,</p>
<p>Let heaven forever keep it from my head</p>
<p>And make me as the poorest vassal 1524 is</p>
<p>That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV O my son,</p>
<p>Heaven put it in thy mind to take it hence,</p>
<p>That thou mightst join the more 1525 thy father’s love,</p>
<p>Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!</p>
<p>Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed</p>
<p>Prince Henry rises</p>
<p>And hear, I think, the very latest 1526 counsel</p>
<p>That ever I shall breathe. Heaven knows, my son,</p>
<p>By what by-paths 1527 and indirect crooked ways</p>
<p>I met 1528 this crown, and I myself know well</p>
<p>How troublesome it sat upon my head.</p>
<p>To thee it shall descend with better quiet,</p>
<p>Better opinion, better confirmation,</p>
<p>For all the soil 1529 of the achievement goes</p>
<p>With me into the earth. It seemed in me</p>
<p>But as an honour snatched with boist’rous 1530 hand,</p>
<p>And I had many 1531 living to upbraid</p>
<p>My gain of it by their assistances,</p>
<p>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</p>
<p>Wounding supposèd peace. All these bold fears 1532</p>
<p>Thou see’st with peril I have answerèd,</p>
<p>For all my reign hath been but as a scene</p>
<p>Acting that argument 1533 . And now my death</p>
<p>Changes the mood, for what in me was purchased 1534 ,</p>
<p>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort 1535 .</p>
<p>So thou the garland 1536 wear’st successively 1537 .</p>
<p>Yet, though thou stand’st more sure than I could do,</p>
<p>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green 1538 ,</p>
<p>And all thy friends, which thou must make 1539 thy friends,</p>
<p>Have but their stings and teeth newly taken out,</p>
<p>By whose fell working 1540 I was first advanced</p>
<p>And by whose power I well might lodge 1541 a fear</p>
<p>To be again displaced, which to avoid,</p>
<p>I cut them off and had a purpose now</p>
<p>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</p>
<p>Lest rest and lying still might make them look</p>
<p>Too near 1542 unto my state 1543 . Therefore, my Harry,</p>
<p>Be it thy course to busy giddy 1544 minds</p>
<p>With foreign quarrels, that action 1545 , hence borne out 1546 ,</p>
<p>May waste 1547 the memory of the former days.</p>
<p>More would I 1548 , but my lungs are wasted 1549 so</p>
<p>That strength of speech is utterly denied me.</p>
<p>How I came by the crown, O heaven forgive,</p>
<p>And grant it may with thee in true peace live!</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY My gracious liege,</p>
<p>You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me.</p>
<p>Then plain and right must my possession be;</p>
<p>Which I with more than with a common pain 1550</p>
<p>Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.</p>
<p>Enter Lord John of Lancaster [Prince John ] and Warwick [behind ]</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father!</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Thou bring’st me happiness and peace, son John,</p>
<p>But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown</p>
<p>From this bare withered trunk 1551 . Upon thy sight</p>
<p>My worldly business makes a period 1552 .</p>
<p>Where is my lord of Warwick?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY My lord of Warwick!</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Doth any name particular belong</p>
<p>Unto the lodging 1553 where I first did swoon 1554 ?</p>
<p>WARWICK ’Tis called Jerusalem, my noble lord.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Laud 1555 be to heaven! Even there my life must
end.</p>
<p>It hath been prophesied to me many years 1556 ,</p>
<p>I should not die but 1557 in Jerusalem,</p>
<p>Which vainly 1558 I supposed the Holy Land.</p>
<p>But bear me to that chamber. There I’ll lie.</p>
<p>In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
