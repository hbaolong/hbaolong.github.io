<h4 id="introduction-to-pericles-prince-of-tyre">Introduction to
Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h4>
<p>A lone figure, venerable and archaically dressed, steps onto the bare
stage: ‘To sing a song that old was sung / From ashes ancient Gower is
come.’ Probably begun by a hack dramatist in 1607 and completed by
Shakespeare in 1608, Pericles marks a fresh departure for the master
after his exclusive focus on tragedy in the previous few years (Macbeth
, King Lear , Timon of Athens , Antony and Cleopatra and the
contemporaneous Coriolanus ). In his next group of plays, Shakespeare
worked in a much more mellow form. The sea, the voyage, the storm, the
unlucky and lucky chances, the years of quest and grief, the child lost
and found, the resurrection of the apparently dead: this is the matter
of the enduring literary form of romance.</p>
<p>One of the most widely circulated and oft-repeated tales from ancient
Greece was that of Apollonius of Tyre, who wandered round virtually the
whole of the Mediterranean world before what he had lost was restored to
him. Chaucer’s friend, John Gower, included a version of it in his
rambling poetic repository of old stories, Confessio Amantis . Just over
two hundred years later, Gower was brought back to life on the boards of
the Globe theatre, with Apollonius renamed Pericles. The poet serves as
Chorus, guiding the audience through the story, asking us to hold in
imagination the wanderer’s ship, two great storms and a series of
landfalls at Antioch and Tarsus in the north-eastern corner of the
Mediterranean, way over at Pentapolis in North Africa, back at Tarsus
and Tyre, and eventually at Ephesus and Mytilene on the Aegean.</p>
<p>Old songs are true in deep but simple ways. If we come to Pericles
looking for the psychological complexities of Shakespearean tragedy, we
will be disappointed. There are none of the subtle shades of moral grey
which endlessly fascinate us in Antony and Cleopatra , another play
which circles around the ancient Mediterranean world and which may have
been written immediately before Pericles . Instead, we have to accept
black and white, and, most disconcertingly, white becoming black
(Dionyza is protectress one moment, murderess the next), then black
becoming white (Lysimachus sets out to deflower Marina in a brothel, but
ends up being deemed a fit husband for her).</p>
<p>The play proceeds by a series of tableaux and formal dumb shows which
offer stark contrasts: first Pericles woos a daughter whose relationship
with her father is turned inward in incest, then he woos a daughter
whose father banteringly pretends to play the oppressive patriarch when
really he is delighted that she has fallen in love with the knight in
rusty armour. The narrative begins with a daughter who is ‘an eater of
her mother’s flesh / By the defiling of her parents’ bed.’ It ends with
a daughter who regenerates her father. In Pericles’ extraordinary line,
‘Thou that beget’st him that did thee beget’, the daughter seems to
father her father without any trace of illicit desire. Having converted
the clientele of the brothel, and even the randy old Bolt, from lust to
honesty, now Marina brings her father from unshaven sack-clothed
wandering to a new life. The fifth act’s inversion of the first act’s
perversion suggests that, episodic though it may be, the play has its
own unity. Though the first two acts were written by another dramatist,
George Wilkins, and the last three by Shakespeare, the stitching
together of the plot was effectively done.</p>
<p>The language is more variable. It only begins to thrill with the hum
of late Shakespearean verse from the great storm speech onwards: ‘O
still / Thy deaf’ning dreadful thunders, gently quench / Thy nimble
sulphurous flashes.’ From here to the end of the play, there are certain
speeches of quite extraordinary beauty and power. Most revelatory of all
is the reunion of father and daughter, which recapitulates yet somehow
goes beyond the reunion of Lear and Cordelia. Shakespeare never wrote a
more moving scene.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>AUTHORSHIP: By Shakespeare and GEORGE WILKINS , author of pamphlets
and plays all published in the period 1606–08, including The Miseries of
Enforced Marriage (1607), acted by the King’s Men. Most dramatic
collaborations in the period include an element of alternation of scenes
between authors, whereas in Pericles there is a clear break, with
Wilkins composing the first two acts and Shakespeare the last three.
This suggests that Wilkins began the play and abandoned it halfway
through, leaving Shakespeare, the company dramatist, to finish it (and
perhaps to apply some polish to the first half). Wilkins seems not to
have written any more plays after 1608, so perhaps there was a falling
out, which may have been exacerbated by his publication of a prose
romance, The Painfull Adventures of Pericles Prince of Tyre (‘Being the
true History of the Play of Pericles , as it was lately presented by the
worthy and ancient Poet John Gower’), closely based on the play.</p>
<p>PLOT: Pericles goes to Antioch as suitor to the daughter of King
Antiochus. He solves a riddle, but it reveals a terrible secret about
the king, so he has to flee. Unsafe even at home in Tyre, he leaves the
trusted Helicanus to govern and sails for Tarsus, where he relieves the
city of famine, earning the gratitude of governor Cleon and his wife
Dionyza. Pericles is then shipwrecked and washed up on the shores of
Pentapolis, where he is rescued by fishermen. They take him to the court
of King Simonides, who is celebrating the birthday of his daughter
Thaisa with a grand tournament. Pericles, concealing his identity,
defeats the many knights jousting for the princess’ hand and wins her.
Antiochus dies. His life no longer in danger – and his identity finally
revealed – Pericles sets sail for Tyre with Thaisa, now pregnant with
their first child. During a storm, Thaisa dies giving birth to a
daughter and is buried at sea. Pericles lands at Tarsus and entrusts his
baby daughter, christened Marina, to the care of Cleon and Dionyza.
Thaisa’s coffin lands at Ephesus, where she is revived by the physician
Cerimon. She enters the temple of Diana as a nun. Fourteen years pass.
Marina attracts the envy of Dionyza, who arranges her murder, only for
her to be abducted by pirates who sell her into a brothel in Mytilene,
where her chastity proves bad for business. Lysimachus, the governor,
visiting the brothel in disguise, is greatly impressed by her. Pericles,
still wandering the seas, arrives by chance at Mytilene, where his ship
is visited by Lysimachus. The latter has Marina brought aboard in an
attempt to rouse Pericles from his sorrows. When their conversation
reveals her to be his daughter, Pericles is overjoyed. In a dream, the
goddess Diana directs him to make sacrifice at her temple in Ephesus and
they set sail to accomplish this final act.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Pericles (25%/121/10), Gower (13%/8/8), Marina (8%/63/5),
Simonides (6%/42/3), Helicanus (5%/37/5), Cleon (5%/19/3), Cerimon
(4%/23/3), Lysimachus (4%/40/2), Bawd (4%/43/2), Dionyza (4%/19/4),
Thaisa (3%/32/6), Bolt (3%/38/2), Antiochus (3%/12/1).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 80% verse, 20% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: 1608. Registered for publication May 1608; Wilkins’ novel The
Painfull Adventures of Pericles , cashing in on the success of the play,
published 1608; performance seen by Venetian and French ambassadors,
probably between April and July 1608. Frequency of editions and
subsequent allusions suggest that the play was a considerable popular
success.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Based primarily on the story of Apollonius of Tyre (an
ancient romance) in book 8 of John Gower’s fourteenth-century poem,
Confessio Amantis ; some use of Lawrence Twine’s version of the same
story in the 1607 novella The Patterne of Painefull Aduentures , which
was also borrowed from extensively by Wilkins in his novelization of the
play.</p>
<p>TEXT: Not in the First Folio, perhaps because the editors knew that
Shakespeare only contributed the second half. Added to the second issue
of the Third Folio (1664), together with a number of ‘apocryphal’ plays.
Though originally registered in 1608 by Edward Blount, who would
eventually publish the Folio, Pericles appeared in Quarto in 1609 under
the imprint of a different publisher, with title THE LATE, and much
admired Play, called Pericles, Prince of Tyre. With the true Relation of
the whole Historie, aduentures, and fortunes of the said Prince: As
also, The no lesse strange, and worthy accidents, in the Birth and Life,
of his Daughter MARIANA. As it hath been diuers and sundry times acted
by his Maiesties Seruants, at the Globe on the Banck-side. By William
Shakespeare . The printing is of poor quality, with many corruptions and
incomprehensible sequences, thus requiring more editorial intervention
than is necessary in any Folio play. Wilkins’ novelization assists in
the interpretation of some passages, but since we do not know the exact
status of his treatment in relation to Shakespeare’s, it is unsafe to
incorporate its readings into the text, as some editors have done. The
Quarto went through six editions (two in 1609 alone), attesting to the
play’s popularity. The Sixth Quarto of 1635, together with the 1634
Quarto of The Two Noble Kinsmen , may have been intended to supplement
the 1632 Second Folio.</p>

<p>Enter Gower</p>
<p>GOWER To sing a song that old 2 was sung</p>
<p>From ashes ancient 3 Gower is come,</p>
<p>Assuming man’s infirmities 4</p>
<p>To glad your ear and please your eyes.</p>
<p>It hath been sung at festivals,</p>
<p>On ember eves 5 and holidays 6 ,</p>
<p>And lords and ladies in their lives</p>
<p>Have read it for restoratives 7 .</p>
<p>The purchase 8 is to make men glorious 9 ,</p>
<p>Et bonum quo antiquius eo melius 10 .</p>
<p>If you — born in these latter times,</p>
<p>When wit 11 ’s more ripe 12 — accept my rhymes,</p>
<p>And that to hear an old man sing</p>
<p>May to your wishes pleasure bring,</p>
<p>I life would wish 13 , and that I might</p>
<p>Waste it for you like taper light 14 .</p>
<p>This Antioch 15 , then: Antiochus the great</p>
<p>Built up this city for his chiefest seat 16 —</p>
<p>The fairest in all Syria.</p>
<p>I tell you what mine authors 17 say:</p>
<p>This king unto him took a peer 18 ,</p>
<p>Who died and left a female heir,</p>
<p>So buxom 19 , blithe and full 20 of face 21</p>
<p>As 22 heaven had lent her all his grace,</p>
<p>With whom the father liking 23 took</p>
<p>And her to incest did provoke:</p>
<p>Bad child, worse father, to entice his own</p>
<p>To evil should be done by none.</p>
<p>But custom 24 what they did begin</p>
<p>Was with long use 25 account’ 26 no sin.</p>
<p>The beauty of this sinful dame</p>
<p>Made many princes thither frame 27</p>
<p>To seek her as a bedfellow,</p>
<p>In marriage pleasures, playfellow,</p>
<p>Which to prevent he made a law</p>
<p>To keep her still 28 , and men in awe 29 :</p>
<p>That whoso 30 asked her for 31 his wife,</p>
<p>His riddle told not 32 , lost his life.</p>
<p>So for her many a wight 33 did die,</p>
<p>Points to the heads on display above, or reveals them</p>
<p>As yon 34 grim looks 35 do testify.</p>
<p>What now ensues, to the judgement of your eye</p>
<p>I give my cause, who best can justify 36 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 1</p>
