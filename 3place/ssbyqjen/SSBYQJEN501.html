<h4 id="scene-1-467-running-scene-5">Scene 1 467 / running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter Polonius and Reynaldo</p>
<p>POLONIUS Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.</p>
<p>Gives money and papers</p>
<p>REYNALDO I will, my lord.</p>
<p>POLONIUS You shall do marvellous 468 wisely, good Reynaldo,</p>
<p>Before you 469 visit him, you make inquiry</p>
<p>Of his behaviour.</p>
<p>REYNALDO My lord, I did intend it.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,</p>
<p>Inquire me 470 first what Danskers 471 are in Paris,</p>
<p>And how, and who, what means and where they keep 472 ,</p>
<p>What company, at what expense, and finding</p>
<p>By this encompassment 473 and drift 474 of question</p>
<p>That they do know my son, come you more nearer</p>
<p>Than your particular demands will touch it 475 :</p>
<p>Take you 476 , as ’twere, some distant knowledge of him,</p>
<p>As thus, ’I know his father and his friends</p>
<p>And in part him.’ Do you mark this, Reynaldo?</p>
<p>REYNALDO Ay, very well, my lord.</p>
<p>POLONIUS ‘And in part him, but’, you may say, ’not well,</p>
<p>But if’t be he I mean, he’s very wild;</p>
<p>Addicted 477 so and so’, and there put on him</p>
<p>What forgeries 478 you please: marry, none so rank 479</p>
<p>As may dishonour him — take heed of that —</p>
<p>But, sir, such wanton 480 , wild and usual slips 481</p>
<p>As are companions noted and most known</p>
<p>To youth and liberty.</p>
<p>REYNALDO As gaming 482 , my lord.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,</p>
<p>Drabbing 483 : you may go so far.</p>
<p>REYNALDO My lord, that would dishonour him.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge 484 .</p>
<p>You must not put another scandal on him,</p>
<p>That he is open to incontinency 485 ;</p>
<p>That’s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly 486</p>
<p>That they may seem the taints of liberty 487 ,</p>
<p>The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</p>
<p>A savageness 488 in unreclaimèd 489 blood,</p>
<p>Of general assault 490 .</p>
<p>REYNALDO But, my good lord—</p>
<p>POLONIUS Wherefore should you do this?</p>
<p>REYNALDO Ay, my lord, I would know that.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Marry, sir, here’s my drift 491 ,</p>
<p>And I believe, it is a fetch of warrant 492 :</p>
<p>You laying these slight sullies on my son,</p>
<p>As ’twere 493 a thing a little soiled i’th’working 494 ,</p>
<p>Mark you, your party in converse 495 , him you would sound 496 ,</p>
<p>Having ever 497 seen in the prenominate 498 crimes</p>
<p>The youth you breathe of 499 guilty, be assured</p>
<p>He closes with you in this consequence 500 :</p>
<p>‘Good sir’ or so, or ‘friend’ or ‘gentleman’,</p>
<p>According to the phrase and the addition 501</p>
<p>Of man and country.</p>
<p>REYNALDO Very good, my lord.</p>
<p>POLONIUS And then, sir, does he this — he does — what was I about to
say? I was about to say something: where did I leave?</p>
<p>REYNALDO At ‘closes in the consequence’, at ‘friend or so’ and
‘gentleman’.</p>
<p>POLONIUS At ‘closes in the consequence’, ay, marry 502 .</p>
<p>He closes with you thus: ’I know the gentleman,</p>
<p>I saw him yesterday, or t’other day’,</p>
<p>Or then, or then, with such and such; and, as you say,</p>
<p>There was he gaming, there o’ertook in’s rouse 503 ,</p>
<p>There falling out at tennis, or perchance,</p>
<p>‘I saw him enter such a house of sale’,</p>
<p>Videlicet 504 , a brothel, or so forth.</p>
<p>See you now;</p>
<p>Your bait of falsehood takes this carp 505 of truth:</p>
<p>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach 506 ,</p>
<p>With windlasses 507 and with assays of bias 508 ,</p>
<p>By indirections 509 find directions out:</p>
<p>So by my former lecture 510 and advice,</p>
<p>Shall you my son. You have 511 me, have you not?</p>
<p>REYNALDO My lord, I have.</p>
<p>POLONIUS God buy 512 you; fare you well.</p>
<p>REYNALDO Good my lord.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Observe his inclination in yourself 513 .</p>
<p>REYNALDO I shall, my lord.</p>
<p>POLONIUS And let him ply his music 514 .</p>
<p>REYNALDO Well 515 , my lord.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Ophelia</p>
<p>POLONIUS Farewell.— How now, Ophelia, what’s the matter?</p>
<p>OPHELIA Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted!</p>
<p>POLONIUS With what, in the name of heaven?</p>
<p>OPHELIA My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,</p>
<p>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet 516 all unbraced 517 ,</p>
<p>No hat 518 upon his head, his stockings fouled,</p>
<p>Ungartered 519 , and down-gyvèd 520 to his ankle,</p>
<p>Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,</p>
<p>And with a look so piteous in purport 521</p>
<p>As if he had been loosèd out of hell</p>
<p>To speak of horrors — he comes before me.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Mad for thy love?</p>
<p>OPHELIA My lord, I do not know, but truly I do fear it.</p>
<p>POLONIUS What said he?</p>
<p>OPHELIA He took me by the wrist and held me hard;</p>
<p>Then goes he to the length of all his arm 522 ,</p>
<p>And with his other hand thus o’er his brow</p>
<p>He falls to such perusal of my face</p>
<p>As 523 he would draw it. Long stayed he so.</p>
<p>At last, a little shaking of mine arm</p>
<p>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</p>
<p>He raised a sigh so piteous and profound</p>
<p>That it did seem to shatter all his bulk</p>
<p>And end his being: that done, he lets me go,</p>
<p>And, with his head over his shoulders turned,</p>
<p>He seemed to find his way without his eyes,</p>
<p>For out o’doors he went without their help,</p>
<p>And to the last, bended their light 524 on me.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Go with me: I will go seek the king.</p>
<p>This is the very ecstasy 525 of love,</p>
<p>Whose violent property fordoes itself 526</p>
<p>And leads the will to desperate undertakings</p>
<p>As oft as any passion under heaven</p>
<p>That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.</p>
<p>What, have you given him any hard words of late?</p>
<p>OPHELIA No, my good lord, but as you did command,</p>
<p>I did repel his letters and denied</p>
<p>His access to me.</p>
<p>POLONIUS That hath made him mad.</p>
<p>I am sorry that with better speed 527 and judgement</p>
<p>I had not quoted 528 him: I feared he did but trifle,</p>
<p>And meant to wreck 529 thee. But beshrew my jealousy 530 !</p>
<p>It seems it is as proper to our age 531</p>
<p>To cast beyond ourselves 532 in our opinions</p>
<p>As it is common for the younger sort</p>
<p>To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:</p>
<p>This must be known, which, being kept close 533 , might move</p>
<p>More grief to hide than hate to utter love 534 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
