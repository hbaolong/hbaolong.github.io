<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-4">Scene 2 / running scene 4</h4>
<p>Enter Baptista, Gremio, Tranio, Katherina, Bianca, [Lucentio ] and
others, Attendants</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Signior Lucentio, this is the ’pointed day.</p>
<p>To Tranio</p>
<p>That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,</p>
<p>And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.</p>
<p>What will be said? What mockery will it be,</p>
<p>To want 762 the bridegroom when the priest attends</p>
<p>To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage?</p>
<p>What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?</p>
<p>KATE No shame but mine: I must forsooth 763 be forced</p>
<p>To give my hand opposed against my heart</p>
<p>Unto a mad-brain rudesby 764 full of spleen 765 ,</p>
<p>Who wooed in haste and means to wed at leisure 766 .</p>
<p>I told you, I, he was a frantic 767 fool,</p>
<p>Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour.</p>
<p>And to be noted for 768 a merry man,</p>
<p>He’ll woo a thousand, ’point the day of marriage,</p>
<p>Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns,</p>
<p>Yet never means to wed where he hath wooed.</p>
<p>Now must the world point at poor Katherine,</p>
<p>And say, ’Lo 769 , there is mad Petruchio’s wife,</p>
<p>If it would please him come and marry her.’</p>
<p>TRANIO Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.</p>
<p>Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,</p>
<p>Whatever fortune stays him from his word 770 .</p>
<p>Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise,</p>
<p>Though he be merry, yet withal he’s honest.</p>
<p>KATE Would Katherine had never seen him though!</p>
<p>Exit weeping [followed by Bianca and others ]</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Go, girl. I cannot blame thee now to weep,</p>
<p>For such an injury would vex a very saint,</p>
<p>Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour 771 .</p>
<p>Enter Biondello</p>
<p>BIONDELLO Master, master, news! Old 772 news, and such news as you
never heard of!</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Is it new and old too? How may that be?</p>
<p>BIONDELLO Why, is it not news to 773 hear of Petruchio’s coming?</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Is he come?</p>
<p>BIONDELLO Why, no, sir.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA What then?</p>
<p>BIONDELLO He is coming.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA When will he be here?</p>
<p>BIONDELLO When he stands where I am and sees you there.</p>
<p>TRANIO But say, what to thine old news?</p>
<p>BIONDELLO Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old jerkin 774
: a pair of old breeches thrice turned 775 : a pair of boots that have
been candle-cases 776 , one buckled, another laced, an old rusty sword
ta’en out of the town armoury, with a broken hilt, and chapeless 777 :
with two broken points 778 : his horse hipped 779 , with an old mothy
saddle and stirrups of no kindred 780 : besides, possessed with the
glanders 781 and like to mose in the chine 782 , troubled with the
lampass 783 , infected with the fashions 784 , full of windgalls 785 ,
sped with spavins 786 , rayed 787 with yellows 788 , past cure of the
fives 789 , stark 790 spoiled with the staggers 791 , begnawn 792 with
the bots 793 , swayed in the back 794 and shoulder-shotten 795 ,
near-legged before 796 and with a half-checked bit 797 and a head-stall
798 of sheep’s leather 799 which, being restrained 800 to keep him from
stumbling, hath been often burst and now repaired with knots, one girth
801 six times pieced 802 , and a woman’s crupper 803 of velure 804 ,
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs 805 , and
here and there pieced with packthread 806 .</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Who comes with him?</p>
<p>BIONDELLO O, sir, his lackey 807 , for all the world caparisoned 808
like the horse: with a linen stock 809 on one leg and a kersey 810
boot-hose 811 on the other, gartered with a red and blue list 812 ; an
old hat and the humour of forty fancies 813 pricked in’t for a feather
814 — a monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
footboy 815 or a gentleman’s lackey.</p>
<p>TRANIO ’Tis some odd humour pricks 816 him to this fashion.</p>
<p>Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparelled 817 .</p>
<p>BAPTISTA I am glad he’s come, howsoe’er he comes.</p>
<p>BIONDELLO Why, sir, he comes not.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Didst thou not say he comes?</p>
<p>BIONDELLO Who? That Petruchio came?</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Ay, that Petruchio came.</p>
<p>BIONDELLO No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Why, that’s all one.</p>
<p>BIONDELLO Nay, by Saint Jamy 818 ,</p>
<p>I hold 819 you a penny,</p>
<p>A horse and a man</p>
<p>Is more than one,</p>
<p>And yet not many.</p>
<p>Enter Petruchio and Grumio</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Come, where be these gallants 820 ? Who’s at home?</p>
<p>BAPTISTA You are welcome, sir.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO And yet I come not well 821 .</p>
<p>BAPTISTA And yet you halt 822 not.</p>
<p>TRANIO Not so well apparelled as I wish you were.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Were it better, I should rush in thus.</p>
<p>But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?</p>
<p>How does my father? Gentles 823 , methinks you frown.</p>
<p>And wherefore 824 gaze this goodly 825 company,</p>
<p>As if they saw some wondrous monument 826 ,</p>
<p>Some comet 827 or unusual prodigy 828 ?</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Why, sir, you know this is your wedding day.</p>
<p>First were we sad, fearing you would not come,</p>
<p>Now sadder that you come so unprovided 829 .</p>
<p>Fie, doff 830 this habit 831 , shame to your estate 832 ,</p>
<p>An eyesore to our solemn 833 festival!</p>
<p>TRANIO And tell us what occasion of import 834</p>
<p>Hath all so long detained you from your wife,</p>
<p>And sent you hither so unlike yourself?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:</p>
<p>Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,</p>
<p>Though in some part enforcèd to digress,</p>
<p>Which at more leisure I will so excuse</p>
<p>As you shall well be satisfied withal.</p>
<p>But where is Kate? I stay too long from her.</p>
<p>The morning wears 835 , ’tis time we were at church.</p>
<p>TRANIO See not your bride in these unreverent 836 robes.</p>
<p>Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Not I, believe me. Thus I’ll visit her.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Good sooth 837 , even thus: therefore ha’ 838 done with
words.</p>
<p>To me she’s married, not unto my clothes.</p>
<p>Could I repair what she will wear 839 in me,</p>
<p>As I can change these poor accoutrements 840 ,</p>
<p>’Twere well for Kate and better for myself.</p>
<p>But what a fool am I to chat with you,</p>
<p>When I should bid good morrow to my bride,</p>
<p>And seal the title with a lovely 841 kiss!</p>
<p>Exeunt [Petruchio and Grumio ]</p>
<p>TRANIO He hath some meaning in his mad attire.</p>
<p>We will persuade him, be it possible,</p>
<p>To put on better ere he go to church.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA I’ll after him, and see the event 842 of this.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Baptista, Gremio and Attendants ]</p>
<p>TRANIO But, sir, love concerneth us to add</p>
<p>To Lucentio</p>
<p>Her father’s liking 843 , which to bring to pass 844 ,</p>
<p>As before I imparted to your worship,</p>
<p>I am to get a man — whate’er he be,</p>
<p>It skills 845 not much, we’ll fit 846 him to our turn —</p>
<p>And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,</p>
<p>And make assurance here in Padua</p>
<p>Of greater sums than I have promisèd.</p>
<p>So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,</p>
<p>And marry sweet Bianca with consent.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster</p>
<p>Doth watch Bianca’s steps 847 so narrowly 848 ,</p>
<p>’Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage 849 ,</p>
<p>Which once performed, let all the world say no,</p>
<p>I’ll keep mine own, despite of all the world.</p>
<p>TRANIO That by degrees we mean to look into,</p>
<p>And watch our vantage 850 in this business.</p>
<p>We’ll overreach 851 the greybeard, Gremio,</p>
<p>The narrow-prying 852 father, Minola,</p>
<p>The quaint 853 musician, amorous Litio,</p>
<p>All for my master’s sake, Lucentio.</p>
<p>Enter Gremio</p>
<p>Signior Gremio, came you from the church?</p>
<p>GREMIO As willingly as e’er I came from school.</p>
<p>TRANIO And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?</p>
<p>GREMIO A bridegroom, say you? ’Tis a groom 854 indeed,</p>
<p>A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.</p>
<p>TRANIO Curster 855 than she? Why, ’tis impossible.</p>
<p>GREMIO Why he’s a devil, a devil, a very fiend.</p>
<p>TRANIO Why, she’s a devil, a devil, the devil’s dam.</p>
<p>GREMIO Tut, she’s a lamb, a dove, a fool to 856 him.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you, Sir 857 Lucentio, when the priest</p>
<p>Should ask if Katherine should be his wife,</p>
<p>‘Ay, by gogs-wouns 858’, quoth he, and swore so loud</p>
<p>That all amazed the priest let fall the book 859 ,</p>
<p>And as he stooped again to take it up,</p>
<p>This mad-brained bridegroom took 860 him such a cuff</p>
<p>That down fell priest and book and book and priest.</p>
<p>‘Now take them 861 up,’ quoth he, ‘if any list 862 .’</p>
<p>TRANIO What said the wench when he rose again?</p>
<p>GREMIO Trembled and shook, for why 863 , he stamped and swore,</p>
<p>As if the vicar meant to cozen 864 him.</p>
<p>But after many 865 ceremonies done,</p>
<p>He calls for wine: ‘A health!’ quoth he, as if</p>
<p>He had been aboard, carousing to his mates</p>
<p>After a storm, quaffed off 866 the muscadel 867</p>
<p>And threw the sops 868 all in the sexton’s face,</p>
<p>Having no other reason</p>
<p>But that his beard grew thin and hungerly 869</p>
<p>And seemed to ask him 870 sops as he was drinking.</p>
<p>This done, he took the bride about the neck</p>
<p>And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack</p>
<p>That at the parting all the church did echo.</p>
<p>And I seeing this came thence for very shame,</p>
<p>And after me, I know, the rout 871 is coming.</p>
<p>Such a mad marriage never was before.</p>
<p>Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels 872 play.</p>
<p>Music plays</p>
<p>Enter Petruchio, Kate, Bianca, Hortensio [disguised as Litio ],
Baptista, [Grumio and others ]</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains.</p>
<p>I know you think 873 to dine with me today,</p>
<p>And have prepared great store of wedding cheer 874 ,</p>
<p>But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,</p>
<p>And therefore here I mean to take my leave.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Is’t possible you will away tonight?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO I must away today, before night come.</p>
<p>Make it no wonder 875 . If you knew my business,</p>
<p>You would entreat me rather go than stay.</p>
<p>And honest 876 company, I thank you all,</p>
<p>That have beheld me give away myself</p>
<p>To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife.</p>
<p>Dine with my father, drink a health to me,</p>
<p>For I must hence, and farewell to you all.</p>
<p>TRANIO Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO It may not be.</p>
<p>GREMIO Let me entreat you.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO It cannot be.</p>
<p>KATE Let me entreat you.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO I am content.</p>
<p>KATE Are you content to stay?</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO I am content you shall entreat me stay,</p>
<p>But yet not stay 877 , entreat me how you can.</p>
<p>KATE Now, if you love me, stay.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO Grumio, my horse.</p>
<p>GRUMIO Ay, sir, they be ready, the oats have eaten the horses 878
.</p>
<p>KATE Nay, then,</p>
<p>Do what thou canst, I will not go today,</p>
<p>No, nor tomorrow, not till I please myself.</p>
<p>The door is open, sir, there lies your way,</p>
<p>You may be jogging whiles your boots are green 879 .</p>
<p>For me, I’ll not be gone till I please myself.</p>
<p>’Tis like you’ll prove a jolly 880 surly groom,</p>
<p>That take it on you at the first so roundly 881 .</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO O Kate, content thee. Prithee be not angry.</p>
<p>KATE I will be angry. What hast thou to do 882 ?—</p>
<p>Father, be quiet. He shall stay my leisure 883 .</p>
<p>GREMIO Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work 884 .</p>
<p>KATE Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.</p>
<p>I see a woman may be made a fool,</p>
<p>If she had not a spirit to resist.</p>
<p>PETRUCHIO They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.—</p>
<p>Obey the bride, you that attend on her.</p>
<p>Go to the feast, revel and domineer 885 ,</p>
<p>Carouse full measure 886 to her maidenhead 887 ,</p>
<p>Be mad 888 and merry, or go hang yourselves.</p>
<p>But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.—</p>
<p>Nay, look not big 889 , nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret.</p>
<p>I will be master of what is mine own:</p>
<p>She is my goods, my chattels 890 , she is my house,</p>
<p>My household stuff 891 , my field, my barn,</p>
<p>My horse, my ox, my ass, my anything 892 ,</p>
<p>And here she stands, touch her whoever dare.</p>
<p>I’ll bring mine action 893 on the proudest he 894</p>
<p>That stops my way in Padua.— Grumio,</p>
<p>Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves.</p>
<p>Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.</p>
<p>Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch thee, Kate.</p>
<p>I’ll buckler 895 thee against a million.</p>
<p>Exeunt Petruchio, Katherina [and Grumio ]</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.</p>
<p>GREMIO Went they not 896 quickly, I should die with laughing.</p>
<p>TRANIO Of all mad matches never was the like.</p>
<p>LUCENTIO Mistress, what’s your opinion of your sister?</p>
<p>BIANCA That, being mad herself, she’s madly mated 897 .</p>
<p>GREMIO I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.</p>
<p>BAPTISTA Neighbours and friends, though bride and bridegroom
wants</p>
<p>For to 898 supply the places at the table,</p>
<p>You know there wants no junkets 899 at the feast.</p>
<p>Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom 900 ’s place,</p>
<p>And let Bianca take her sister’s room.</p>
<p>TRANIO Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it 901 ?</p>
<p>BAPTISTA She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let’s go.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
