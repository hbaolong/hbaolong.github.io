<h4 id="scene-4-423-running-scene-3">Scene 4 423 / running scene 3</h4>
<p>Enter Clarence and Keeper 424</p>
<p>KEEPER Why looks your grace so heavily 425 today?</p>
<p>CLARENCE O, I have passed a miserable night,</p>
<p>So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,</p>
<p>That, as I am a Christian faithful man,</p>
<p>I would not spend 426 another such a night,</p>
<p>Though ’twere 427 to buy a world of happy days,</p>
<p>So full of dismal 428 terror was the time.</p>
<p>KEEPER What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.</p>
<p>CLARENCE Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,</p>
<p>And was embarked to cross to Burgundy,</p>
<p>And in my company my brother Gloucester,</p>
<p>Who from my cabin tempted me to walk</p>
<p>Upon the hatches 429 : there we looked toward England,</p>
<p>And cited up 430 a thousand heavy times,</p>
<p>During the wars of York and Lancaster</p>
<p>That had befall’n us. As we paced along</p>
<p>Upon the giddy 431 footing of the hatches,</p>
<p>Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling</p>
<p>Struck me, that thought to stay 432 him, overboard,</p>
<p>Into the tumbling billows of the main 433 .</p>
<p>O lord, methought, what pain it was to drown!</p>
<p>What dreadful noise of water in mine ears,</p>
<p>What sights of ugly death within mine eyes.</p>
<p>Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks:</p>
<p>A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon:</p>
<p>Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,</p>
<p>Inestimable 434 stones, unvalued 435 jewels,</p>
<p>All scattered in the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Some lay in dead men’s skulls, and in the holes</p>
<p>Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,</p>
<p>As ’twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,</p>
<p>That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep,</p>
<p>And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.</p>
<p>KEEPER Had you such leisure in the time of death</p>
<p>To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?</p>
<p>CLARENCE Methought I had, and often did I strive</p>
<p>To yield the ghost 436 . But still the envious flood 437</p>
<p>Stopped in 438 my soul, and would not let it forth</p>
<p>To find the empty, vast 439 and wand’ring air,</p>
<p>But smothered it within my panting bulk 440 ,</p>
<p>Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.</p>
<p>KEEPER Awaked you not in this sore 441 agony?</p>
<p>CLARENCE No, no, my dream was lengthened after life.</p>
<p>O, then began the tempest to my soul,</p>
<p>I passed, methought, the melancholy flood 442 ,</p>
<p>With that sour ferryman 443 which poets write of,</p>
<p>Unto the kingdom of perpetual night 444 .</p>
<p>The first that there did greet my stranger 445 soul,</p>
<p>Was my great father-in-law, renownèd Warwick,</p>
<p>Who spake aloud, ’What scourge for perjury 446</p>
<p>Can this dark monarchy 447 afford 448 false Clarence?’</p>
<p>And so he vanished. Then came wand’ring by</p>
<p>A shadow 449 like an angel, with bright hair</p>
<p>Dabbled in blood, and he shrieked 450 out aloud,</p>
<p>’Clarence is come: false, fleeting 451 , perjured Clarence,</p>
<p>That stabbed me in the field 452 by Tewkesbury.</p>
<p>Seize on him, Furies 453 , take him unto torment!’</p>
<p>With that, methought, a legion 454 of foul fiends</p>
<p>Environed 455 me, and howlèd in mine ears</p>
<p>Such hideous cries, that with the very noise</p>
<p>I trembling waked, and for a season 456 after</p>
<p>Could not believe but that I was in hell,</p>
<p>Such terrible impression made the dream.</p>
<p>KEEPER No marvel, lord, though 457 it affrighted you,</p>
<p>I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.</p>
<p>CLARENCE Ah, keeper, keeper, I have done these things,</p>
<p>That now give evidence against my soul,</p>
<p>For Edward’s sake, and see how he requites 458 me.</p>
<p>O God! If my deep prayers cannot appease thee,</p>
<p>But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,</p>
<p>Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,</p>
<p>O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children.</p>
<p>Keeper, I prithee 459 sit by me awhile.</p>
<p>My soul is heavy 460 , and I fain would sleep.</p>
<p>KEEPER I will, my lord. God give your grace good rest.</p>
<p>Clarence sleeps</p>
<p>Enter Brackenbury, the Lieutenant</p>
<p>BRACKENBURY Sorrow breaks 461 seasons 462 and reposing hours 463
,</p>
<p>Makes the night morning, and the noontide 464 night.</p>
<p>Princes have but their titles for 465 their glories,</p>
<p>An outward honour for 466 an inward toil,</p>
<p>And, for 467 unfelt imaginations 468 ,</p>
<p>They often feel a world of restless cares 469 :</p>
<p>So that between their titles and low name 470 ,</p>
<p>There’s nothing differs but the outward fame 471 .</p>
<p>Enter [the ] two Murderers</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Ho, who’s here?</p>
<p>BRACKENBURY What wouldst thou, fellow? And how cam’st thou
hither?</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my
legs.</p>
<p>BRACKENBURY What, so brief?</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER ’Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let him see our
commission, and talk no more.</p>
<p>Gives Brackenbury a paper</p>
<p>BRACKENBURY I am in this commanded to deliver</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.</p>
<p>I will not reason 472 what is meant hereby,</p>
<p>Because I will 473 be guiltless from the meaning.</p>
<p>There lies the duke asleep, and there the keys.</p>
<p>I’ll to the king and signify to 474 him</p>
<p>That thus I have resigned to you my charge.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER You may, sir, ’tis a point of wisdom. Fare you
well.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER No: he’ll say ’twas done cowardly, when he wakes.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER Why he shall never wake until the great judgement
day.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Why, then he’ll say we stabbed him sleeping.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER The urging of 475 that word ‘judgement’ hath bred a
kind of remorse in me.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER What? Art thou afraid?</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER Not to kill him, having a warrant, but to be damned
for killinghim, from the which no warrant can defend me.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER I thought thou hadst been resolute.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER So I am, to let him live.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER I’ll back to the Duke of Gloucester and tell him
so.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER Nay, I prithee stay 476 a little. I hope this
passionate humour 477</p>
<p>of mine will change. It was wont to hold me 478 but while one tells
twenty 479 .</p>
<p>They pause or count to twenty</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER How dost thou feel thyself now?</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER Some certain dregs of conscience are yet within
me.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Remember our reward, when the deed’s done.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER Come, he dies. I had forgot the reward.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Where’s thy conscience now?</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER O, in the Duke of Gloucester’s purse.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER When he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy
conscience</p>
<p>flies out.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER ’Tis no matter, let it go. There’s few or none will
entertain 480 it.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER What if it come to thee again?</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER I’ll not meddle with it: it makes a man a coward. A
man cannot steal, but it accuseth him: a man cannot swear, but it checks
481 him: a man cannot lie 482 with his neighbour’s wife, but it detects
him. ’Tis a blushing shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man’s bosom:
it fills a man full of obstacles: it made me once restore 483 a purse of
gold that, by chance, I found: it beggars any man that keeps 484 it: it
is turned out of towns and cities for 485 a dangerous thing: and every
man that means to live well 486 endeavours to trust to himself and live
without it.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER ’Tis even now at my elbow, persuading me not to kill
the duke.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER Take the devil in thy mind, and believe him 487 not:
he would insinuate 488 with thee but to make thee sigh.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER Spoke like a tall 489 man that respects thy
reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Take 490 him on the costard 491 with the hilts of thy
sword, and then throw him into the malmsey-butt 492 in the next
room.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER O, excellent device 493 ; and make a sop 494 of
him.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Soft, he wakes.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER Strike!</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER No, we’ll reason 495 with him.</p>
<p>CLARENCE Where art thou, keeper? Give me a cup of wine.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon 496 .</p>
<p>CLARENCE In God’s name, what art thou?</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER A man, as you are.</p>
<p>CLARENCE But not, as I am, royal.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Nor you, as we are, loyal.</p>
<p>CLARENCE Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER My voice is now the king’s, my looks mine own.</p>
<p>CLARENCE How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!</p>
<p>Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?</p>
<p>Who sent you hither? Wherefore 497 do you come?</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER To, to, to—</p>
<p>CLARENCE To murder me?</p>
<p>BOTH Ay, ay.</p>
<p>CLARENCE You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,</p>
<p>And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.</p>
<p>Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Offended us you have not, but the king.</p>
<p>CLARENCE I shall be reconciled to him again.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER Never, my lord: therefore prepare to die.</p>
<p>CLARENCE Are you drawn forth 498 among a world of men</p>
<p>To slay the innocent? What is my offence?</p>
<p>Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?</p>
<p>What lawful quest 499 have given their verdict up</p>
<p>Unto the frowning judge? Or who pronounced</p>
<p>The bitter sentence of poor Clarence’ death,</p>
<p>Before I be convict 500 by course of law?</p>
<p>To threaten me with death is most unlawful.</p>
<p>I charge 501 you, as you hope for any goodness</p>
<p>That you depart and lay no hands on me.</p>
<p>The deed you undertake is damnable.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER What we will do, we do upon command.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER And he that hath commanded is our king.</p>
<p>CLARENCE Erroneous 502 vassals 503 , the great king of kings 504</p>
<p>Hath in the table of his law 505 commanded</p>
<p>That thou shalt do no murder 506 . Will you then</p>
<p>Spurn at 507 his edict and fulfil a man’s?</p>
<p>Take heed, for he holds vengeance in his hand,</p>
<p>To hurl upon their heads that break his law.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,</p>
<p>For false forswearing 508 and for murder, too.</p>
<p>Thou didst receive the sacrament 509 to fight</p>
<p>In quarrel of 510 the house of Lancaster.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER And, like a traitor to the name of God,</p>
<p>Didst break that vow, and with thy treacherous blade</p>
<p>Unripp’dst 511 the bowels 512 of thy sovereign’s son 513 .</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER How canst thou urge God’s dreadful 514 law to us,</p>
<p>When thou hast broke it in such dear 515 degree?</p>
<p>CLARENCE Alas, for whose sake did I that ill deed?</p>
<p>For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.</p>
<p>He sends you not to murder me for this,</p>
<p>For in that sin he is as deep as I.</p>
<p>If God will be avengèd for the deed,</p>
<p>O, know you yet he doth it publicly.</p>
<p>Take not the quarrel 516 from his powerful arm:</p>
<p>He needs no indirect 517 or lawless course</p>
<p>To cut off 518 those that have offended him.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Who made thee, then, a bloody 519 minister,</p>
<p>When gallant-springing 520 brave Plantagenet,</p>
<p>That princely novice 521 , was struck dead by thee?</p>
<p>CLARENCE My brother’s love 522 , the devil and my rage.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Thy brother’s love, our duty and thy faults,</p>
<p>Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.</p>
<p>CLARENCE If you do love my brother, hate not me.</p>
<p>I am his brother and I love him well.</p>
<p>If you are hired for meed 523 , go back again,</p>
<p>And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,</p>
<p>Who shall reward you better for my life</p>
<p>Than Edward will for tidings of my death.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates
you.</p>
<p>CLARENCE O no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.</p>
<p>Go you to him from me.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Ay, so we will.</p>
<p>CLARENCE Tell him, when that our princely father York</p>
<p>Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm,</p>
<p>He little thought of this divided friendship 524 .</p>
<p>Bid Gloucester think on this, and he will weep.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Ay, millstones, as he lessoned 525 us to weep.</p>
<p>CLARENCE O, do not slander him, for he is kind 526 .</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Right, as snow in harvest.</p>
<p>Come, you deceive yourself:</p>
<p>’Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.</p>
<p>CLARENCE It cannot be, for he bewept my fortune,</p>
<p>And hugged me in his arms, and swore, with sobs</p>
<p>That he would labour my delivery 527 .</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Why, so he doth, when he delivers you</p>
<p>From this earth’s thraldom 528 to the joys of heaven.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.</p>
<p>CLARENCE Have you that holy feeling 529 in your souls</p>
<p>To counsel me to make my peace with God,</p>
<p>And are you yet to your own souls so blind</p>
<p>That you will war with God by murd’ring me?</p>
<p>O, sirs, consider, they that set you on</p>
<p>To do this deed will hate you for the deed.</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER What shall we do?</p>
<p>To First Murderer</p>
<p>CLARENCE Relent, and save your souls.</p>
<p>Which of you, if you were a prince’s son,</p>
<p>Being pent 530 from liberty, as I am now,</p>
<p>If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,</p>
<p>Would not entreat for life as you would beg,</p>
<p>Were you in my distress?</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Relent? No: ’tis cowardly and womanish.</p>
<p>CLARENCE Not to relent is beastly 531 , savage, devilish.</p>
<p>My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks.</p>
<p>To Second Murderer</p>
<p>O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,</p>
<p>Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,</p>
<p>A begging prince what beggar pities not?</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER Look behind you, my lord.</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER Take that, and that: if all this will not do,</p>
<p>Stabs him</p>
<p>I’ll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.</p>
<p>Exit [with the body ]</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER A bloody deed, and desperately dispatched 532 .</p>
<p>How fain 533 , like Pilate, would I wash my hands</p>
<p>Of this most grievous murder 534 !</p>
<p>Enter First Murderer</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER How now? What mean’st thou, that thou help’st me
not?</p>
<p>By heaven, the duke shall know how slack you have been!</p>
<p>SECOND MURDERER I would he knew that I had saved his brother.</p>
<p>Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say,</p>
<p>For I repent me that the duke is slain.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>FIRST MURDERER So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.</p>
<p>Well, I’ll go hide the body in some hole</p>
<p>Till that the duke give order for his burial.</p>
<p>And when I have my meed, I will away,</p>
<p>For this will out 535 , and then I must not stay.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
