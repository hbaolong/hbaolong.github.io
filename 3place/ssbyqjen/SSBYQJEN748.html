9</h4>
<p>Enter the Constable of France, the Lord Rambures, Orléans, Dauphin
with others</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Tut, I have the best armour of the world. Would it were
day!</p>
<p>ORLÉANS You have an excellent armour, but let my horse have his
due.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE It is the best horse of Europe.</p>
<p>ORLÉANS Will it never be morning?</p>
<p>DAUPHIN My lord of Orléans, and my lord high constable, you talk of
horse and armour?</p>
<p>ORLÉANS You are as well provided of both as any prince in the
world.</p>
<p>DAUPHIN What a long night is this? I will not change my horse with
any that treads but on four pasterns 1111 . Ch’ha! 1112 He bounds from
the earth, as if his entrails 1113 were hairs 1114 : le cheval volant
1115 , the Pegasus 1116 , chez les narines de feu 1117 ! When I bestride
him, I soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air, the earth sings when he
touches it, the basest horn 1118 of his hoof is more musical than the
pipe of Hermes 1119 .</p>
<p>ORLÉANS He’s of the colour of the nutmeg.</p>
<p>DAUPHIN And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for Perseus 1120
: he is pure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water
never appear in him, but only in patient stillness while his rider
mounts him. He is indeed a horse, and all other jades 1121 you may call
beasts.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute 1122 and excellent
horse.</p>
<p>DAUPHIN It is the prince of palfreys 1123 . His neigh is like the
bidding 1124 of a monarch and his countenance 1125 enforces homage.</p>
<p>ORLÉANS No more, cousin.</p>
<p>DAUPHIN Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the rising of the
lark to the lodging 1126 of the lamb 1127 , vary 1128 deserved praise on
my palfrey. It is a theme as fluent as the sea: turn the sands 1129 into
eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all. ‘Tis a subject
for a sovereign to reason on, and for a sovereign’s sovereign to ride
on, and for the world, familiar to us and unknown, to lay apart their
particular functions 1130 and wonder at him. I once writ a sonnet in his
praise and began thus: ’Wonder of nature’——</p>
<p>ORLÉANS I have heard a sonnet begin so to one’s mistress.</p>
<p>DAUPHIN Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser
1131 , for my horse is my mistress.</p>
<p>ORLÉANS Your mistress bears 1132 well.</p>
<p>DAUPHIN Me 1133 well, which is the prescript 1134 praise and
perfection of a good and particular 1135 mistress.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly 1136
shook your back 1137 .</p>
<p>DAUPHIN So perhaps did yours.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Mine was not bridled 1138 .</p>
<p>DAUPHIN O, then belike 1139 she was old and gentle, and you rode 1140
like a kern of Ireland 1141 , your French hose 1142 off, and in your
straight strossers 1143 .</p>
<p>CONSTABLE You have good judgement in horsemanship 1144 .</p>
<p>DAUPHIN Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and ride not warily,
fall into foul bogs 1145 . I had rather have my horse to my
mistress.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE I had as lief 1146 have my mistress a jade 1147 .</p>
<p>DAUPHIN I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair 1148
.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow to
1149 my mistress.</p>
<p>DAUPHIN ‘Le chien est retourné à son propre vomissement, et la truie
lavée au bourbier .’ 1150 Thou makest use of anything.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Yet do I not use 1151 my horse for my mistress, or any such
proverb so little kin to the purpose 1152 .</p>
<p>RAMBURES My lord constable, the armour that I saw in your tent
tonight, are those stars or suns upon it?</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Stars, my lord.</p>
<p>DAUPHIN Some of them will fall 1153 tomorrow, I hope.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE And yet my sky shall not want 1154 .</p>
<p>DAUPHIN That may be, for you bear a many 1155 superfluously and
’twere more honour 1156 some were away.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Ev’n 1157 as your horse bears your praises, who would trot
as well, were some of your brags dismounted.</p>
<p>DAUPHIN Would I were able to load him with his desert 1158 ! Will it
never be day? I will trot tomorrow a mile, and my way shall be paved
with English faces.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of my way
1159 . But I would it were morning, for I would fain be about the ears
1160 of the English.</p>
<p>RAMBURES Who will go to hazard 1161 with me for twenty prisoners?</p>
<p>CONSTABLE You must first go yourself to hazard 1162 , ere you have
them.</p>
<p>DAUPHIN ’Tis midnight, I’ll go arm myself.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>ORLÉANS The dauphin longs for morning.</p>
<p>RAMBURES He longs to eat the English.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE I think he will eat all he kills 1163 .</p>
<p>ORLÉANS By the white hand of my lady, he’s a gallant prince.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Swear by her foot 1164 , that she may tread out 1165 the
oath.</p>
<p>ORLÉANS He is simply the most active 1166 gentleman of France.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Doing 1167 is activity, and he will still 1168 be
doing.</p>
<p>ORLÉANS He never did harm 1169 , that I heard of.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Nor will do none tomorrow: he will keep that good name
still.</p>
<p>ORLÉANS I know him to be valiant.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE I was told that by one that knows him better than you.</p>
<p>ORLÉANS What’s 1170 he?</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Marry, he 1171 told me so himself, and he said he cared not
who knew it.</p>
<p>ORLÉANS He needs not, it is no hidden virtue 1172 in him.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE By my faith, sir, but it is: never anybody saw it but his
lackey 1173 . ’Tis a hooded 1174 valour, and when it appears, it will
bate 1175 .</p>
<p>ORLÉANS Ill will never said well.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE I will cap that proverb with ‘There is flattery in
friendship.’</p>
<p>ORLÉANS And I will take up 1176 that with ‘Give the devil his
due.’</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Well placed: there stands your friend for the devil. Have
at the very eye 1177 of that proverb with ‘A pox of the devil.’</p>
<p>ORLÉANS You are the better at proverbs, by how much ‘A fool’s bolt
1178 is soon shot 1179 .’</p>
<p>CONSTABLE You have shot over 1180 .</p>
<p>ORLÉANS ’Tis not the first time you were overshot 1181 .</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER My lord high constable, the English lie within fifteen
hundred paces of your tents.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Who hath measured the ground?</p>
<p>MESSENGER The lord Grandpré.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were day!
Alas, poor</p>
<p>Harry of England: he longs not for the dawning as we do.</p>
<p>ORLÉANS What a wretched and peevish 1182 fellow is this king of
England, to mope 1183 with his fat-brained 1184 followers so far out of
his knowledge 1185 !</p>
<p>CONSTABLE If the English had any apprehension 1186 , they would run
away.</p>
<p>ORLÉANS That they lack, for if their heads had any intellectual
armour, they could never wear such heavy head-pieces 1187 .</p>
<p>RAMBURES That island of England breeds very valiant creatures; their
mastiffs 1188 are of unmatchable courage.</p>
<p>ORLÉANS Foolish curs, that run winking 1189 into the mouth of a
Russian bear 1190 and have their heads crushed like rotten apples. You
may as well say, that’s a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast 1191
on the lip of a lion.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Just, just. And the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in
robustious 1192 and rough coming on 1193 , leaving their wits with their
wives, and then give 1194 them great meals of beef and iron and steel;
they will eat like wolves and fight like devils.</p>
<p>ORLÉANS Ay, but these English are shrewdly 1195 out of beef.</p>
<p>CONSTABLE Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs 1196 to
eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm. Come, shall we about
it?</p>
<p>ORLÉANS It is now two o’clock, but let me see, by ten</p>
<p>We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
<p>[Enter ] Chorus</p>
<p>CHORUS Now entertain conjecture 1197 of 1198 a time</p>
<p>When creeping murmur 1199 and the poring 1200 dark</p>
<p>Fills the wide vessel of the universe.</p>
<p>From camp to camp through the foul 1201 womb of night</p>
<p>The hum of either army stilly 1202 sounds,</p>
<p>That the fixed sentinels almost receive</p>
<p>The secret whispers of each other’s watch.</p>
<p>Fire answers fire, and through their paly 1203 flames</p>
<p>Each battle sees the other’s umbered 1204 face.</p>
<p>Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs</p>
<p>Piercing the night’s dull ear, and from the tents,</p>
<p>The armourers, accomplishing 1205 the knights,</p>
<p>With busy hammers closing rivets 1206 up,</p>
<p>Give dreadful note 1207 of preparation.</p>
<p>The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,</p>
<p>And the third hour of drowsy morning name.</p>
<p>Proud of their numbers and secure 1208 in soul,</p>
<p>The confident and over-lusty 1209 French</p>
<p>Do the low-rated 1210 English play 1211 at dice;</p>
<p>And chide 1212 the cripple tardy-gaited 1213 night,</p>
<p>Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp</p>
<p>So tediously 1214 away. The poor condemnèd English,</p>
<p>Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires</p>
<p>Sit patiently and inly 1215 ruminate</p>
<p>The morning’s danger, and their gesture sad 1216</p>
<p>Investing 1217 lank-lean 1218 cheeks and war-worn coats</p>
<p>Presented them unto the gazing moon</p>
<p>So many horrid ghosts. O, now, who 1219 will behold</p>
<p>The royal captain of this ruined band</p>
<p>Walking from watch 1220 to watch, from tent to tent,</p>
<p>Let him cry ‘Praise and glory on his head!’</p>
<p>For forth he goes and visits all his host 1221 ,</p>
<p>Bids them good morrow with a modest smile</p>
<p>And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.</p>
<p>Upon his royal face there is no note 1222</p>
<p>How dread an army hath enrounded 1223 him;</p>
<p>Nor doth he dedicate 1224 one jot of colour</p>
<p>Unto the weary and all-watchèd 1225 night,</p>
<p>But freshly looks and over-bears 1226 attaint 1227</p>
<p>With cheerful semblance 1228 and sweet majesty,</p>
<p>That every wretch, pining 1229 and pale before,</p>
<p>Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks.</p>
<p>A largess 1230 universal like the sun</p>
<p>His liberal 1231 eye doth give to every one,</p>
<p>Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all 1232 ,</p>
<p>Behold, as may unworthiness 1233 define,</p>
<p>A little touch 1234 of Harry in the night.</p>
<p>And so our scene must to the battle fly,</p>
<p>Where —— O, for pity! —— we shall much disgrace</p>
<p>With four or five most vile and ragged 1235 foils 1236 ,</p>
<p>Right ill-disposed 1237 in brawl ridiculous,</p>
<p>The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,</p>
<p>Minding 1238 true things by what their mock’ries 1239 be.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
