20</h4>
<p>Enter Lorenzo and Jessica</p>
<p>LORENZO The moon shines bright. In such a night as this,</p>
<p>When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees</p>
<p>And they did make no noise, in such a night</p>
<p>Troilus 1320 methinks mounted the Trojan walls</p>
<p>And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents</p>
<p>Where Cressid lay that night.</p>
<p>JESSICA In such a night</p>
<p>Did Thisbe 1321 fearfully o’ertrip 1322 the dew,</p>
<p>And saw the lion’s shadow ere himself 1323 ,</p>
<p>And ran dismayed away.</p>
<p>LORENZO In such a night</p>
<p>Stood Dido 1324 with a willow 1325 in her hand</p>
<p>Upon the wild 1326 sea banks and waft 1327 her love</p>
<p>To come again to Carthage.</p>
<p>JESSICA In such a night</p>
<p>Medea 1328 gathered the enchanted herbs</p>
<p>That did renew 1329 old Aeson.</p>
<p>LORENZO In such a night</p>
<p>Did Jessica steal 1330 from the wealthy Jew</p>
<p>And with an unthrift 1331 love did run from Venice</p>
<p>As far as Belmont.</p>
<p>JESSICA In such a night</p>
<p>Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,</p>
<p>Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,</p>
<p>And ne’er a true one.</p>
<p>LORENZO In such a night</p>
<p>Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew 1332 ,</p>
<p>Slander her love 1333 , and he forgave it her.</p>
<p>JESSICA I would out-night you 1334 , did 1335 nobody come.</p>
<p>But hark, I hear the footing 1336 of a man.</p>
<p>Enter [Stephano, a ] Messenger</p>
<p>LORENZO Who comes so fast in silence of the night?</p>
<p>STEPHANO A friend.</p>
<p>LORENZO A friend? What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?</p>
<p>STEPHANO Stephano is my name, and I bring word</p>
<p>My mistress will before the break of day</p>
<p>Be here at Belmont. She doth stray about 1337</p>
<p>By holy crosses 1338 , where she kneels and prays</p>
<p>For happy wedlock hours.</p>
<p>LORENZO Who comes with her?</p>
<p>STEPHANO None but a holy hermit and her maid.</p>
<p>I pray you is my master yet returned?</p>
<p>LORENZO He is not, nor we have not heard from him.</p>
<p>But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,</p>
<p>And ceremoniously let us prepare</p>
<p>Some welcome for the mistress of the house.</p>
<p>Enter Clown [Lancelet ]</p>
<p>LANCELET Sola 1339 , sola! Wo ha, ho! 1340 Sola, sola!</p>
<p>LORENZO Who calls?</p>
<p>LANCELET Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo?</p>
<p>And Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!</p>
<p>LORENZO Leave hollowing 1341 , man! Here.</p>
<p>LANCELET Sola! Where, where?</p>
<p>LORENZO Here.</p>
<p>LANCELET Tell him there’s a post 1342 come from my master, with his
horn 1343 full of good news: my master will be here ere morning.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>LORENZO Sweet soul, let’s in 1344 , and there expect 1345 their
coming.</p>
<p>And yet no matter. Why should we go in?</p>
<p>My friend Stephano, signify 1346 , pray you,</p>
<p>Within the house, your mistress is at hand,</p>
<p>And bring your music 1347 forth into the air 1348 .</p>
<p>[Exit Stephano ]</p>
<p>How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!</p>
<p>Here will we sit and let the sounds of music</p>
<p>Creep in our ears. Soft stillness and the night</p>
<p>Become 1349 the touches 1350 of sweet harmony.</p>
<p>Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven 1351</p>
<p>They sit</p>
<p>Is thick inlaid with patens 1352 of bright gold.</p>
<p>There’s not the smallest orb 1353 which thou behold’st</p>
<p>But in his motion 1354 like an angel sings,</p>
<p>Still choiring 1355 to the young-eyed 1356 cherubins 1357 ;</p>
<p>Such harmony is in immortal souls,</p>
<p>But whilst this muddy vesture of decay 1358</p>
<p>Doth grossly 1359 close it in 1360 , we cannot hear it.</p>
<p>[Enter Musicians ]</p>
<p>Come, ho, and wake Diana 1361 with a hymn!</p>
<p>With sweetest touches pierce your mistress’ ear,</p>
<p>And draw her home with music.</p>
<p>JESSICA I am never merry when I hear sweet music.</p>
<p>Play music</p>
<p>LORENZO The reason is, your spirits 1362 are attentive 1363 .</p>
<p>For do but note a wild and wanton 1364 herd</p>
<p>Or race 1365 of youthful and unhandled 1366 colts,</p>
<p>Fetching 1367 mad bounds 1368 , bellowing and neighing loud,</p>
<p>Which is the hot condition 1369 of their blood 1370 .</p>
<p>If they but 1371 hear perchance 1372 a trumpet sound,</p>
<p>Or any air 1373 of music touch their ears,</p>
<p>You shall perceive them make a mutual stand 1374 ,</p>
<p>Their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze</p>
<p>By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet 1375</p>
<p>Did feign 1376 that Orpheus 1377 drew 1378 trees, stones and floods
1379 ,</p>
<p>Since nought so stockish 1380 , hard and full of rage,</p>
<p>But music for time doth change his nature.</p>
<p>The man that hath no music in himself,</p>
<p>Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,</p>
<p>Is fit for treasons, stratagems 1381 and spoils 1382 .</p>
<p>The motions 1383 of his spirit are dull 1384 as night</p>
<p>And his affections 1385 dark as Erebus 1386 .</p>
<p>Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.</p>
<p>Enter Portia and Nerissa</p>
<p>PORTIA That light we see is burning in my hall.</p>
<p>How far that little candle throws his beams!</p>
<p>So shines a good deed in a naughty 1387 world.</p>
<p>NERISSA When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.</p>
<p>PORTIA So doth the greater glory dim the less.</p>
<p>A substitute shines brightly as a king</p>
<p>Until a king be by 1388 , and then his 1389 state 1390</p>
<p>Empties itself, as doth an inland brook</p>
<p>Into the main of waters 1391 . Music! Hark!</p>
<p>Music</p>
<p>NERISSA It is your music, madam, of the house.</p>
<p>PORTIA Nothing is good, I see, without respect 1392 .</p>
<p>Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.</p>
<p>NERISSA Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.</p>
<p>PORTIA The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark</p>
<p>When neither is attended 1393 , and I think</p>
<p>The nightingale, if she should sing by day,</p>
<p>When every goose is cackling, would be thought</p>
<p>No better a musician than the wren.</p>
<p>How many things by season 1394 seasoned 1395 are</p>
<p>To their right praise and true perfection!</p>
<p>Peace, ho! The moon sleeps with Endymion 1396</p>
<p>And would not be awaked.</p>
<p>Music ceases</p>
<p>LORENZO That is the voice,</p>
<p>Or I am much deceived, of Portia.</p>
<p>PORTIA He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,</p>
<p>By the bad voice.</p>
<p>LORENZO Dear lady, welcome home.</p>
<p>PORTIA We have been praying for our husbands’ welfare,</p>
<p>Which speed 1397 , we hope, the better for our words 1398 .</p>
<p>Are they returned?</p>
<p>LORENZO Madam, they are not yet,</p>
<p>But there is come a messenger before 1399 ,</p>
<p>To signify their coming.</p>
<p>PORTIA Go in, Nerissa.</p>
<p>Give order to my servants that they take</p>
<p>No note at all of our being absent hence,</p>
<p>Nor you, Lorenzo, Jessica, nor you.</p>
<p>A tucket 1400 sounds</p>
<p>LORENZO Your husband is at hand. I hear his trumpet.</p>
<p>We are no telltales, madam; fear you not.</p>
<p>PORTIA This night methinks is but the daylight sick.</p>
<p>It looks a little paler. ’Tis a day,</p>
<p>Such as the day is when the sun is hid.</p>
<p>Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano and their followers</p>
<p>BASSANIO We should hold day with the Antipodes 1401 ,</p>
<p>If you would walk in absence of the sun 1402 .</p>
<p>PORTIA Let me give light 1403 , but let me not be light,</p>
<p>For a light wife doth make a heavy 1404 husband,</p>
<p>And never be Bassanio so for me,</p>
<p>But God sort 1405 all! You are welcome home, my lord.</p>
<p>BASSANIO I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.</p>
<p>This is the man, this is Antonio,</p>
<p>To whom I am so infinitely bound 1406 .</p>
<p>PORTIA You should in all sense be much bound to him,</p>
<p>For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.</p>
<p>ANTONIO No more than I am well acquitted of 1407 .</p>
<p>PORTIA Sir, you are very welcome to our house.</p>
<p>It must appear in other ways than words:</p>
<p>Therefore I scant 1408 this breathing 1409 courtesy.</p>
<p>GRATIANO By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong.</p>
<p>To Nerissa</p>
<p>In faith, I gave it to the judge’s clerk.</p>
<p>Would he were gelt 1410 that had it, for my part 1411 ,</p>
<p>Since you do take it, love, so much at 1412 heart.</p>
<p>PORTIA A quarrel, ho, already? What’s the matter?</p>
<p>GRATIANO About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring</p>
<p>That she did give me, whose posy 1413 was</p>
<p>For all the world like cutler’s poetry</p>
<p>Upon a knife, ‘Love me, and leave me not.’</p>
<p>NERISSA What talk you of the posy or the value?</p>
<p>You swore to me when I did give it you,</p>
<p>That you would wear it till the hour of death</p>
<p>And that it should lie with you in your grave.</p>
<p>Though 1414 not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,</p>
<p>You should have been respective 1415 and have kept it.</p>
<p>Gave it a judge’s clerk! But well I know</p>
<p>The clerk will ne’er wear hair on’s face that had it.</p>
<p>GRATIANO He will, an if he live to be a man.</p>
<p>NERISSA Ay, if a woman live to be a man.</p>
<p>GRATIANO Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,</p>
<p>A kind of boy, a little scrubbèd 1416 boy,</p>
<p>No higher than thyself, the judge’s clerk,</p>
<p>A prating 1417 boy, that begged it as a fee.</p>
<p>I could not for my heart deny it him.</p>
<p>PORTIA You were to blame — I must be plain with you —</p>
<p>To part so slightly 1418 with your wife’s first gift.</p>
<p>A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger</p>
<p>And so riveted 1419 with faith unto your flesh.</p>
<p>I gave my love a ring and made him swear</p>
<p>Never to part with it, and here he stands.</p>
<p>I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it,</p>
<p>Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth</p>
<p>That the world masters 1420 . Now, in faith, Gratiano,</p>
<p>You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief.</p>
<p>An ’twere to me, I should be mad 1421 at it.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Why, I were best to cut my left hand off</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>And swear I lost the ring defending it.</p>
<p>GRATIANO My lord Bassanio gave his ring away</p>
<p>Unto the judge that begged it and indeed</p>
<p>Deserved it too. And then the boy, his clerk,</p>
<p>That took some pains in writing, he begged mine,</p>
<p>And neither man nor master would take aught</p>
<p>But the two rings.</p>
<p>PORTIA What ring gave you my lord?</p>
<p>Not that, I hope, which you received of me.</p>
<p>BASSANIO If I could add a lie unto a fault,</p>
<p>I would deny it. But you see my finger</p>
<p>Hath not the ring upon it. It is gone.</p>
<p>PORTIA Even so void is your false heart of truth.</p>
<p>By heaven, I will ne’er come in your bed</p>
<p>Until I see the ring.</p>
<p>NERISSA Nor I in yours till I again see mine.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Sweet Portia,</p>
<p>If you did know to whom I gave the ring,</p>
<p>If you did know for whom I gave the ring,</p>
<p>And would conceive 1422 for what I gave the ring,</p>
<p>And how unwillingly I left the ring,</p>
<p>When nought would be accepted but the ring,</p>
<p>You would abate the strength of your displeasure.</p>
<p>PORTIA If you had known the virtue 1423 of the ring,</p>
<p>Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,</p>
<p>Or your own honour to contain 1424 the ring,</p>
<p>You would not then have parted with the ring.</p>
<p>What man is there so much unreasonable,</p>
<p>If 1425 you had pleased 1426 to have defended it</p>
<p>With any terms of zeal, wanted 1427 the modesty 1428</p>
<p>To urge 1429 the thing held as a ceremony 1430 ?</p>
<p>Nerissa teaches me what to believe:</p>
<p>I’ll die for’t but some woman had the ring.</p>
<p>BASSANIO No, by mine honour, madam, by my soul,</p>
<p>No woman had it, but a civil doctor 1431 ,</p>
<p>Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me</p>
<p>And begged the ring; the which I did deny him</p>
<p>And suffered 1432 him to go displeased away —</p>
<p>Even he that had held up 1433 the very life</p>
<p>Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?</p>
<p>I was enforced to send it after him.</p>
<p>I was beset with shame and courtesy.</p>
<p>My honour would not let ingratitude</p>
<p>So much besmear it 1434 . Pardon me, good lady!</p>
<p>And by these blessèd candles of the night 1435 ,</p>
<p>Had you been there, I think you would have begged</p>
<p>The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.</p>
<p>PORTIA Let not that doctor e’er come near my house.</p>
<p>Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,</p>
<p>And that which you did swear to keep for me,</p>
<p>I will become as liberal 1436 as you.</p>
<p>I’ll not deny him anything I have,</p>
<p>No, not my body nor my husband’s bed.</p>
<p>Know 1437 him I shall, I am well sure of it.</p>
<p>Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus 1438 .</p>
<p>If you do not, if I be left alone,</p>
<p>Now, by mine honour 1439 , which is yet 1440 mine own,</p>
<p>I’ll have the doctor for my bedfellow.</p>
<p>NERISSA And I his clerk: therefore be well advised 1441</p>
<p>How you do leave me to mine own protection.</p>
<p>GRATIANO Well, do you so. Let not me take 1442 him, then.</p>
<p>For if I do, I’ll mar 1443 the young clerk’s pen 1444 .</p>
<p>ANTONIO I am th’unhappy 1445 subject of these quarrels.</p>
<p>PORTIA Sir, grieve not you. You are welcome notwithstanding.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Portia, forgive me this enforcèd wrong,</p>
<p>And in the hearing of these many friends,</p>
<p>I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,</p>
<p>Wherein I see myself—</p>
<p>PORTIA Mark you but that!</p>
<p>In both my eyes he doubly sees himself 1446 .</p>
<p>In each eye, one. Swear by your double 1447 self,</p>
<p>And there’s an oath of credit 1448 .</p>
<p>BASSANIO Nay, but hear me.</p>
<p>Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear</p>
<p>I never more will break an oath with thee.</p>
<p>ANTONIO I once did lend my body for thy wealth,—</p>
<p>To Bassanio</p>
<p>Which, but for him that had your husband’s ring,</p>
<p>To Portia</p>
<p>Had quite miscarried 1449 . I dare be bound again,</p>
<p>My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord</p>
<p>Will never more break faith advisedly 1450 .</p>
<p>PORTIA Then you shall be his surety 1451 . Give him this</p>
<p>And bid him keep it better than the other.</p>
<p>She gives Antonio the ring</p>
<p>ANTONIO Here, Lord Bassanio. Swear to keep this ring.</p>
<p>BASSANIO By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!</p>
<p>PORTIA I had it of him. Pardon, Bassanio,</p>
<p>For, by this ring, the doctor lay with 1452 me.</p>
<p>NERISSA And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,</p>
<p>For that same scrubbèd boy, the doctor’s clerk,</p>
<p>Shows her ring</p>
<p>In lieu of 1453 this last night did lie with me.</p>
<p>GRATIANO Why, this is like the mending of highways</p>
<p>In summer, where the ways are fair 1454 enough.</p>
<p>What, are we cuckolds 1455 ere we have deserved it?</p>
<p>PORTIA Speak not so grossly 1456 . You are all amazed.</p>
<p>Here is a letter, read it at your leisure.</p>
<p>She gives a letter</p>
<p>It comes from Padua, from Bellario.</p>
<p>There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,</p>
<p>Nerissa there her clerk. Lorenzo here</p>
<p>Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,</p>
<p>And but e’en 1457 now returned. I have not yet</p>
<p>Entered my house. Antonio, you are welcome,</p>
<p>And I have better news in store for you</p>
<p>Than you expect. Unseal this letter soon.</p>
<p>Gives him a letter</p>
<p>There you shall find three of your argosies</p>
<p>Are richly 1458 come to harbour suddenly:</p>
<p>You shall not know by what strange accident</p>
<p>I chancèd on this letter.</p>
<p>ANTONIO I am dumb 1459 .</p>
<p>BASSANIO Were you the doctor and I knew you not?</p>
<p>GRATIANO Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?</p>
<p>NERISSA Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,</p>
<p>Unless he live until he be a man.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.</p>
<p>When I am absent, then lie with my wife.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Sweet lady, you have given me life and living 1460 ;</p>
<p>For here I read for certain that my ships</p>
<p>Are safely come to road 1461 .</p>
<p>PORTIA How now, Lorenzo?</p>
<p>My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.</p>
<p>NERISSA Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee.</p>
<p>There do I give to you and Jessica,</p>
<p>From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,</p>
<p>After his death, of all he dies possessed of.</p>
<p>LORENZO Fair ladies, you drop manna 1462 in the way</p>
<p>Of starvèd people.</p>
<p>PORTIA It is almost morning,</p>
<p>And yet I am sure you are not satisfied</p>
<p>Of these events at full 1463 . Let us go in,</p>
<p>And charge us there upon inter’gatories 1464 ,</p>
<p>And we will answer all things faithfully.</p>
<p>GRATIANO Let it be so. The first inter’gatory 1465</p>
<p>That my Nerissa shall be sworn on 1466 is,</p>
<p>Whether till the next night she had rather stay 1467 ,</p>
<p>Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.</p>
<p>But were the day come, I should wish it dark,</p>
<p>Till I were couching 1468 with the doctor’s clerk.</p>
<p>Well, while I live I’ll fear no other thing</p>
<p>So sore 1469 as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring 1470 .</p>
