<h4 id="scene-1-1-running-scene-1">Scene 1 1 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs and other
weapons</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.</p>
<p>ALL Speak, speak.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN You are all resolved rather to die than to famish 2
?</p>
<p>ALL Resolved, resolved.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the
people.</p>
<p>ALL We know’t, we know’t.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN Let us kill him, and we’ll have corn at our own price.
Is’t a verdict 3 ?</p>
<p>ALL No more talking on’t 4 : let it be done: away, away.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN One word, good citizens.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN We are accounted poor 5 citizens, the patricians 6 good
7 : what authority 8 surfeits on 9 would relieve us. If they would yield
us but the superfluity 10 while it were wholesome 11 , we might guess 12
they relieved us humanely: but they think we are too dear 13 : the
leanness that afflicts us, the object 14 of our misery, is as an
inventory to particularize their abundance 15 : our sufferance 16 is a
gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes 17 , ere 18 we become
rakes 19 . For the gods know, I speak this in hunger for bread, not in
thirst for revenge.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Would you proceed especially against Caius
Martius?</p>
<p>ALL Against him first: he’s a very dog 20 to the commonalty 21 .</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Consider you what services he has done for his
country?</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN Very well, and could be content to give him good report
for’t, but that he pays himself with being proud.</p>
<p>ALL Nay, but speak not maliciously.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN I say unto you, what he hath done famously 22 , he did
it to that end 23 : though soft-conscienced 24 men can be content to say
it was for his country, he did it to please his mother and to be partly
proud 25 , which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue 26 .</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN What he cannot help in his nature, you account a vice
in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN If 27 I must not, I need not be barren of accusations:
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition 28 .</p>
<p>Shouts within</p>
<p>What shouts are these? The other side o’th’city is risen 29 : why
stay we prating 30 here? To th’Capitol 31 !</p>
<p>ALL Come, come.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN Soft 32 , who comes here?</p>
<p>Enter Menenius Agrippa</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Worthy Menenius Agrippa, one that hath always loved
the people.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN He’s one honest enough: would all the rest were so!</p>
<p>MENENIUS What work’s, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you</p>
<p>With bats 33 and clubs? The matter 34 , speak, I pray you.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Our business is not unknown to th’senate: they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we’ll show
’em in deeds. They say poor suitors 35 have strong 36 breaths: they
shall know we have strong arms too.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Why, masters 37 , my good friends, mine honest
neighbours,</p>
<p>Will you undo 38 yourselves?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN We cannot, sir, we are undone already.</p>
<p>MENENIUS I tell you, friends, most charitable care</p>
<p>Have the patricians of you. For 39 your wants,</p>
<p>Your suffering in this dearth 40 , you may as well</p>
<p>Strike at the heaven with your staves 41 as lift them</p>
<p>Against the Roman state, whose course will on 42</p>
<p>The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs 43</p>
<p>Of more strong link asunder than can ever</p>
<p>Appear in your impediment 44 . For the dearth,</p>
<p>The gods, not the patricians, make it, and</p>
<p>Your knees 45 to them, not arms 46 , must help. Alack,</p>
<p>You are transported 47 by calamity</p>
<p>Thither where more attends 48 you, and you slander</p>
<p>The helms 49 o’th’state, who care for you like fathers,</p>
<p>When you curse them as enemies.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Care for us? True 50 , indeed, they ne’er cared for us
yet. Suffer 51 us to famish, and their store-houses crammed with grain:
make edicts for 52 usury 53 , to support usurers 54 : repeal daily any
wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more piercing 55
statutes daily, to chain up and restrain the poor. If the wars eat us
not up, they will: and there’s all the love they bear us.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Either you must</p>
<p>Confess yourselves wondrous 56 malicious,</p>
<p>Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you</p>
<p>A pretty 57 tale: it may be you have heard it,</p>
<p>But since it serves my purpose, I will venture</p>
<p>To stale’t 58 a little more.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Well, I’ll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to fob
off our disgrace 59 with a tale: but, an’t 60 please you, deliver 61
.</p>
<p>MENENIUS There was a time when all the body’s members</p>
<p>Rebelled against the belly, thus accused it:</p>
<p>That only like a gulf it did remain</p>
<p>I’th’midst o’th’body, idle and unactive,</p>
<p>Still cupboarding 62 the viand 63 , never bearing</p>
<p>Like 64 labour with the rest, where th’other instruments 65</p>
<p>Did see and hear, devise 66 , instruct, walk, feel,</p>
<p>And, mutually participate 67 , did minister</p>
<p>Unto the appetite and affection 68 common</p>
<p>Of the whole body. The belly answered—</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Well, sir, what answer made the belly?</p>
<p>MENENIUS Sir, I shall tell you: with a kind of smile,</p>
<p>Which ne’er came from the lungs 69 , but even thus 70 —</p>
<p>For look you, I may make the belly smile</p>
<p>As well as speak — it tauntingly replied</p>
<p>To th’discontented members, the mutinous parts</p>
<p>That envied his receipt 71 : even so most fitly 72</p>
<p>As you malign our senators for that 73</p>
<p>They are not such as you.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Your belly’s answer: what?</p>
<p>The kingly crownèd head, the vigilant eye,</p>
<p>The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,</p>
<p>Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,</p>
<p>With other muniments 74 and petty helps</p>
<p>In this our fabric 75 , if that they—</p>
<p>MENENIUS What then? Fore me 76 , this fellow speaks 77 ! What then?
What then?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Should by the cormorant 78 belly be restrained,</p>
<p>Who is the sink 79 o’th’body—</p>
<p>MENENIUS Well, what then?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN The former 80 agents, if they did complain,</p>
<p>What could the belly answer?</p>
<p>MENENIUS I will tell you,</p>
<p>If you’ll bestow a small 81 — of what you have little —</p>
<p>Patience awhile, you’st 82 hear the belly’s answer.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN You’re long about it.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Note me this, good friend:</p>
<p>Your 83 most grave 84 belly was deliberate,</p>
<p>Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered:</p>
<p>‘True is it, my incorporate 85 friends,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>’That I receive the general 86 food at first</p>
<p>Which you do live upon: and fit it is,</p>
<p>Because I am the storehouse and the shop</p>
<p>Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,</p>
<p>I send it through the rivers of your blood</p>
<p>Even to the court 87 , the heart, to th’seat o’th’brain,</p>
<p>And through the cranks 88 and offices 89 of man,</p>
<p>The strongest nerves 90 and small inferior veins</p>
<p>From me receive that natural competency 91</p>
<p>Whereby they live. And though that all at once’ —</p>
<p>You, my good friends, this says the belly, mark 92 me—</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Ay, sir, well, well.</p>
<p>MENENIUS ’Though all at once cannot</p>
<p>See what I do deliver out to each,</p>
<p>Yet I can make my audit up 93 , that all</p>
<p>From me do back receive the flour 94 of all,</p>
<p>And leave me but the bran 95 .’ What say you to’t?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN It was an answer: how apply you this?</p>
<p>MENENIUS The senators of Rome are this good belly,</p>
<p>And you the mutinous members: for examine</p>
<p>Their counsels and their cares, digest 96 things rightly</p>
<p>Touching the weal o’th’common 97 , you shall find</p>
<p>No public benefit which you receive</p>
<p>But it proceeds or comes from them to you</p>
<p>And no way from yourselves. What do you think,</p>
<p>You, the great toe of this assembly?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN I the great toe? Why the great toe?</p>
<p>MENENIUS For that, being one o’th’lowest, basest, poorest</p>
<p>Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost:</p>
<p>Thou rascal 98 , that art worst in blood 99 to run,</p>
<p>Lead’st first to win some vantage 100 .</p>
<p>But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:</p>
<p>Rome and her rats are at the point of battle:</p>
<p>The one side 101 must have bale 102 .</p>
<p>Enter Caius Martius</p>
<p>Hail, noble Martius.</p>
<p>MARTIUS Thanks. What’s the matter, you dissentious 103 rogues,</p>
<p>That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,</p>
<p>Make yourselves scabs 104 ?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN We have ever 105 your good word.</p>
<p>MARTIUS He that will give good words to thee will flatter</p>
<p>Beneath abhorring 106 . What would you have, you curs 107 ,</p>
<p>That like nor 108 peace nor war? The one 109 affrights you,</p>
<p>The other makes you proud 110 . He that trusts to you,</p>
<p>Where he should find you lions, finds you hares 111 :</p>
<p>Where foxes 112 , geese 113 : you are no surer 114 , no,</p>
<p>Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,</p>
<p>Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue 115 is</p>
<p>To make him worthy whose offence subdues him</p>
<p>And curse that justice did it 116 . Who 117 deserves greatness</p>
<p>Deserves 118 your hate, and your affections 119 are</p>
<p>A sick man’s appetite, who desires most that</p>
<p>Which would increase his evil 120 . He that depends</p>
<p>Upon your favours swims with fins of lead,</p>
<p>And hews down oaks with rushes 121 . Hang ye! Trust ye?</p>
<p>With every minute you do change a mind,</p>
<p>And call him noble that was now 122 your hate,</p>
<p>Him vile that was your garland 123 . What’s the matter,</p>
<p>That in these several 124 places of the city</p>
<p>You cry against the noble senate, who,</p>
<p>Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else 125</p>
<p>Would feed on one another?— What’s their seeking 126 ?</p>
<p>To Menenius</p>
<p>MENENIUS For corn at their own rates, whereof they say</p>
<p>The city is well stored.</p>
<p>MARTIUS Hang ’em! They say?</p>
<p>They’ll sit by th’fire, and presume to know</p>
<p>What’s done i’th’Capitol: who’s like to rise,</p>
<p>Who thrives and who declines: side 127 factions and give out 128</p>
<p>Conjectural marriages 129 , making parties strong</p>
<p>And feebling 130 such as stand not in their liking</p>
<p>Below their cobbled 131 shoes. They say there’s grain enough?</p>
<p>Would the nobility lay aside their ruth 132 ,</p>
<p>And let me use my sword, I’d make a quarry 133</p>
<p>With thousands of these quartered 134 slaves, as high</p>
<p>As I could pick 135 my lance.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded:</p>
<p>For though abundantly they lack discretion,</p>
<p>Yet are they passing 136 cowardly. But I beseech you,</p>
<p>What says the other troop?</p>
<p>MARTIUS They are dissolved: hang ’em:</p>
<p>They said they were an-hungry 137 , sighed forth proverbs</p>
<p>That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs 138 must eat,</p>
<p>That meat 139 was made for mouths, that the gods sent not</p>
<p>Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds 140</p>
<p>They vented their complainings, which being answered,</p>
<p>And a petition granted them, a strange one —</p>
<p>To break the heart of generosity 141 ,</p>
<p>And make bold power look pale — they threw their caps</p>
<p>As 142 they would hang them on the horns o’th’moon,</p>
<p>Shouting 143 their emulation.</p>
<p>MENENIUS What is granted them?</p>
<p>MARTIUS Five tribunes 144 to defend their vulgar 145 wisdoms,</p>
<p>Of their own choice. One’s Junius Brutus,</p>
<p>Sicinius Velutus, and I know not. ’Sdeath 146 ,</p>
<p>The rabble should have first unroofed the city,</p>
<p>Ere so prevailed with me: it will in time</p>
<p>Win upon power 147 and throw forth greater themes 148</p>
<p>For insurrection’s arguing 149 .</p>
<p>MENENIUS This is strange.</p>
<p>MARTIUS Go get you home, you fragments 150 .</p>
<p>To the Citizens</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger hastily</p>
<p>MESSENGER Where’s Caius Martius?</p>
<p>MARTIUS Here: what’s the matter?</p>
<p>MESSENGER The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.</p>
<p>MARTIUS I am glad on’t: then we shall ha’ means to vent 151</p>
<p>Our musty superfluity 152 . See, our best elders.</p>
<p>Enter Sicinius Velutus, Junius Brutus, Cominius, Titus Lartius, with
other Senators</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Martius, ’tis true that 153 you have lately told
us:</p>
<p>The Volsces are in arms.</p>
<p>MARTIUS They have a leader,</p>
<p>Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to’t 154 :</p>
<p>I sin in envying his nobility,</p>
<p>And were I anything but what I am,</p>
<p>I would wish me only he.</p>
<p>COMINIUS You have fought together 155 !</p>
<p>MARTIUS Were half to half the world by th’ears 156 and he</p>
<p>Upon my party 157 , I’d revolt to make</p>
<p>Only my wars with 158 him. He is a lion</p>
<p>That I am proud to hunt.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Then, worthy Martius,</p>
<p>Attend upon 159 Cominius to these wars.</p>
<p>COMINIUS It is your former promise.</p>
<p>To Martius</p>
<p>MARTIUS Sir, it is,</p>
<p>And I am constant 160 : Titus Lartius, thou</p>
<p>Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus’ face.</p>
<p>What, art thou stiff 161 ? Stand’st out? 162</p>
<p>LARTIUS No, Caius Martius,</p>
<p>I’ll lean upon one crutch and fight with t’other,</p>
<p>Ere 163 stay behind this business.</p>
<p>MENENIUS O, true-bred!</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Your 164 company to th’Capitol, where I know</p>
<p>Our greatest friends attend 165 us.</p>
<p>LARTIUS Lead you on.—</p>
<p>To Cominius</p>
<p>Follow Cominius, we must follow you,</p>
<p>To Martius</p>
<p>Right worthy your priority 166 .</p>
<p>COMINIUS Noble Martius.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Hence to your homes, be gone.</p>
<p>To the Citizens</p>
<p>MARTIUS Nay, let them follow:</p>
<p>The Volsces have much corn: take these rats thither</p>
<p>To gnaw their garners 167 . Worshipful 168 mutineers,</p>
<p>Your valour puts well forth 169 : pray follow.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Citizens steal away. Sicinius and Brutus remain</p>
<p>SICINIUS Was ever man so proud as is this Martius?</p>
<p>BRUTUS He has no equal.</p>
<p>SICINIUS When we were chosen tribunes for the people—</p>
<p>BRUTUS Marked you his lip and eyes?</p>
<p>SICINIUS Nay, but his taunts.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Being moved 170 , he will not spare to gird 171 the gods.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Bemock the modest 172 moon.</p>
<p>BRUTUS The 173 present wars devour him: he is grown</p>
<p>Too proud to be so valiant.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Such a nature,</p>
<p>Tickled with 174 good success, disdains the shadow</p>
<p>Which he treads on at noon 175 : but I do wonder</p>
<p>His insolence 176 can brook 177 to be commanded</p>
<p>Under Cominius.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Fame, at the which he aims,</p>
<p>In whom already he’s well graced, cannot</p>
<p>Better be held nor more attained than by</p>
<p>A place below the first: for what miscarries 178</p>
<p>Shall be the general’s fault, though he perform</p>
<p>To th’utmost of a man, and giddy censure 179</p>
<p>Will then cry out of Martius ’O, if he</p>
<p>Had borne the business!’</p>
<p>SICINIUS Besides, if things go well,</p>
<p>Opinion 180 that so sticks on Martius shall</p>
<p>Of his demerits 181 rob Cominius.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Come:</p>
<p>Half all Cominius’ honours are 182 to Martius,</p>
<p>Though Martius earned them not: and all his faults</p>
<p>To Martius shall be honours, though indeed</p>
<p>In aught 183 he merit not.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Let’s hence, and hear</p>
<p>How the dispatch 184 is made, and in what fashion,</p>
<p>More than his singularity 185 , he goes</p>
<p>Upon this present action 186 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS Let’s along 187 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
