<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-1-15">Scene 1 ／ running scene 1 15</h4>
<p>Enter Sampson and Gregory with swords and bucklers 16 , of the House
of Capulet</p>
<p>SAMPSON Gregory, o’my word, we’ll not carry coals 17 .</p>
<p>GREGORY No, for then we should be colliers 18 .</p>
<p>SAMPSON I mean, if we be in choler 19 , we’ll draw 20 .</p>
<p>GREGORY Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’th’collar 21 .</p>
<p>SAMPSON I strike 22 quickly, being moved 23 .</p>
<p>GREGORY But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</p>
<p>SAMPSON A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</p>
<p>GREGORY To move is to stir 24 ; and to be valiant 25 is to stand 26 :
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn’st away.</p>
<p>SAMPSON A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the
wall 27 of any man or maid of Montague’s.</p>
<p>GREGORY That shows thee a weak slave 28 , for the weakest goes to the
wall 29 .</p>
<p>SAMPSON True, and therefore women being the weaker vessels are ever
thrust to the wall 30 : therefore I will push Montague’s men 31 from the
wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.</p>
<p>GREGORY The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.</p>
<p>SAMPSON ’Tis all one 32 , I will show myself a tyrant: when I have
fought with the men, I will be civil with the maids, and cut off their
heads.</p>
<p>GREGORY The heads of the maids?</p>
<p>SAMPSON Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads 33 , take 34
it in what sense 35 thou wilt.</p>
<p>GREGORY They must take it in sense that feel it.</p>
<p>SAMPSON Me they shall feel while I am able to stand 36 , and ’tis
known I am a pretty piece of flesh 37 .</p>
<p>GREGORY ’Tis well thou art not fish 38 : if thou hadst, thou hadst
been poor John 39 . Draw thy tool 40 , here comes of the house of the
Montagues.</p>
<p>Enter two other Servingmen [Abraham and Balthasar ]</p>
<p>Sampson draws</p>
<p>SAMPSON My naked weapon 41 is out. Quarrel, I will back thee.</p>
<p>GREGORY How 42 , turn thy back and run?</p>
<p>SAMPSON Fear 43 me not.</p>
<p>GREGORY No, marry 44 , I fear thee!</p>
<p>SAMPSON Let us take the law of 45 our sides: let them begin.</p>
<p>GREGORY I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list
46 .</p>
<p>Frowns</p>
<p>SAMPSON Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb 47 at them, which is
a disgrace to them if they bear it.</p>
<p>Bites his thumb</p>
<p>ABRAHAM Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>
<p>SAMPSON I do bite my thumb, sir.</p>
<p>ABRAHAM Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>
<p>SAMPSON Is the law of our side, if I say ay?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>GREGORY No.</p>
<p>SAMPSON No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I bite my
thumb, sir.</p>
<p>GREGORY Do you quarrel, sir?</p>
<p>ABRAHAM Quarrel sir? No, sir.</p>
<p>SAMPSON If you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as
you.</p>
<p>ABRAHAM No better?</p>
<p>SAMPSON Well, sir.</p>
<p>Enter Benvolio</p>
<p>GREGORY Say ‘better’— here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>SAMPSON Yes, better.</p>
<p>ABRAHAM You lie.</p>
<p>SAMPSON Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing 48
blow.</p>
<p>They fight</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Part, fools! Put up your swords, you know not what you
do.</p>
<p>Draws and parts them</p>
<p>Enter Tybalt</p>
<p>TYBALT What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds 49 ?</p>
<p>Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.</p>
<p>Draws</p>
<p>BENVOLIO I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,</p>
<p>Or manage 50 it to part these men with me.</p>
<p>TYBALT What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word,</p>
<p>As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.</p>
<p>Have at thee, coward!</p>
<p>Fight</p>
<p>Enter three or four Citizens with clubs</p>
<p>OFFICER Clubs, bills and partisans 51 ! Strike! Beat them down! Down
with the Capulets!</p>
<p>Down with the Montagues!</p>
<p>Enter Old Capulet in his gown 52 , and his Wife</p>
<p>CAPULET What noise is this? Give me my long sword 53 , ho!</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?</p>
<p>CAPULET My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,</p>
<p>And flourishes his blade in spite of 54 me.</p>
<p>Enter Old Montague and his Wife</p>
<p>MONTAGUE Thou villain Capulet!— Hold me not, let me go.</p>
<p>LADY MONTAGUE Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.</p>
<p>Enter Prince Escalus with his train</p>
<p>PRINCE Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,</p>
<p>Profaners of this neighbour-stainèd steel 55 —</p>
<p>Will they not hear?— What, ho! You men, you beasts,</p>
<p>That quench the fire of your pernicious 56 rage</p>
<p>With purple fountains issuing from your veins:</p>
<p>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</p>
<p>Throw your mistempered 57 weapons to the ground,</p>
<p>And hear the sentence of your movèd 58 prince.</p>
<p>Three civil broils, bred of an airy word,</p>
<p>By thee, Old Capulet, and Montague,</p>
<p>Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets,</p>
<p>And made Verona’s ancient 59 citizens</p>
<p>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments 60</p>
<p>To wield Old partisans, in hands as old,</p>
<p>Cankered 61 with peace, to part your cankered hate:</p>
<p>If ever you disturb our streets again,</p>
<p>Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace 62 .</p>
<p>For this time, all the rest depart away:</p>
<p>You Capulet, shall go along with me,</p>
<p>And, Montague, come you this afternoon,</p>
<p>To know our further pleasure 63 in this case,</p>
<p>To old Freetown, our common judgement-place.</p>
<p>Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</p>
<p>Exeunt. [Montague, Lady Montague and Benvolio remain ]</p>
<p>MONTAGUE Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach 64 ?</p>
<p>Speak, nephew, were you by 65 when it began?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Here were the servants of your adversary,</p>
<p>And yours, close fighting ere 66 I did approach:</p>
<p>I drew to part them: in the instant came</p>
<p>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared 67 ,</p>
<p>Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,</p>
<p>He swung about his head and cut the winds,</p>
<p>Who nothing hurt withal 68 hissed him in scorn:</p>
<p>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,</p>
<p>Came more and more, and fought on part and part 69 ,</p>
<p>Till the prince came, who parted either part.</p>
<p>LADY MONTAGUE O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?</p>
<p>Right glad am I he was not at this fray.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun</p>
<p>Peered forth 70 the golden window of the east,</p>
<p>A troubled mind drave 71 me to walk abroad 72 ,</p>
<p>Where, underneath the grove of sycamore</p>
<p>That westward rooteth from the city side 73 ,</p>
<p>So early walking did I see your son:</p>
<p>Towards him I made, but he was ware 74 of me</p>
<p>And stole into the covert 75 of the wood:</p>
<p>I, measuring his affections 76 by my own,</p>
<p>Which then most sought where most might not be found 77 ,</p>
<p>Being one too many by my weary self,</p>
<p>Pursued my humour 78 , not pursuing his,</p>
<p>And gladly shunned who 79 gladly fled from me.</p>
<p>MONTAGUE Many a morning hath he there been seen,</p>
<p>With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,</p>
<p>Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs,</p>
<p>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</p>
<p>Should in the farthest east begin to draw</p>
<p>The shady curtains from Aurora 80 ’s bed,</p>
<p>Away from light steals home my heavy 81 son 82 ,</p>
<p>And private in his chamber pens himself,</p>
<p>Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out</p>
<p>And makes himself an artificial night:</p>
<p>Black 83 and portentous must this humour 84 prove,</p>
<p>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</p>
<p>MONTAGUE I neither know it nor can learn of 85 him.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Have you importuned him by any means 86 ?</p>
<p>MONTAGUE Both by myself and many other friends,</p>
<p>But he, his own affections’ counsellor,</p>
<p>Is to himself — I will not say how true 87 —</p>
<p>But to himself so secret and so close 88 ,</p>
<p>So far from sounding 89 and discovery,</p>
<p>As is the bud bit with an envious 90 worm 91 ,</p>
<p>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,</p>
<p>Or dedicate his beauty to the same.</p>
<p>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,</p>
<p>We would as willingly give cure as know.</p>
<p>Enter Romeo</p>
<p>BENVOLIO See, where he comes. So please you, step aside,</p>
<p>I’ll know his grievance, or be much denied.</p>
<p>MONTAGUE I would thou wert so happy by thy stay 92</p>
<p>To hear true shrift 93 .— Come, madam, let’s away.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Montague and Lady Montague ]</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Good morrow, cousin 94 .</p>
<p>ROMEO Is the day so young?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO But new struck nine.</p>
<p>ROMEO Ay me, sad hours seem long.</p>
<p>Was that my father that went hence so fast?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?</p>
<p>ROMEO Not having that, which, having, makes them short.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO In love?</p>
<p>ROMEO Out—</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Of love?</p>
<p>ROMEO Out of her favour where I am in love.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Alas that love, so gentle in his view 95 ,</p>
<p>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof 96 !</p>
<p>ROMEO Alas that love, whose view is muffled 97 still,</p>
<p>Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!</p>
<p>Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?</p>
<p>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.</p>
<p>Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:</p>
<p>Why, then, O brawling love, O loving hate,</p>
<p>O anything of nothing first create 98 !</p>
<p>O heavy lightness, serious vanity 99 ,</p>
<p>Misshapen chaos of well-seeming 100 forms,</p>
<p>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,</p>
<p>Still-waking 101 sleep that is not what it is!</p>
<p>This love feel I, that feel no love in this.</p>
<p>Dost thou not laugh?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO No, coz, I rather weep.</p>
<p>ROMEO Good heart, at what?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO At thy good heart’s oppression.</p>
<p>ROMEO Why, such is love’s transgression.</p>
<p>Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,</p>
<p>Which thou wilt propagate 102 , to have it pressed</p>
<p>With more of thine: this love 103 that thou hast shown</p>
<p>Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.</p>
<p>Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs,</p>
<p>Being purged 104 , a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes,</p>
<p>Being vexed 105 , a sea nourished with loving tears.</p>
<p>What is it else? A madness most discreet 106 ,</p>
<p>A choking gall 107 and a preserving sweet.</p>
<p>Farewell, my coz 108 .</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Soft 109 , I will go along,</p>
<p>An if 110 you leave me so, you do me wrong.</p>
<p>ROMEO Tut, I have lost myself, I am not here:</p>
<p>This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Tell me in sadness 111 , who is that you love.</p>
<p>ROMEO What, shall I groan and tell thee?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Groan? Why, no. But sadly tell me who.</p>
<p>ROMEO A sick man in sadness makes his will:</p>
<p>A word ill-urged to one that is so ill.</p>
<p>In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO I aimed so near 112 , when I supposed you loved.</p>
<p>ROMEO A right good mark-man 113 ! And she’s fair I love.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO A right fair mark 114 , fair coz, is soonest hit.</p>
<p>ROMEO Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit</p>
<p>With Cupid’s arrow 115 , she hath Dian’s wit 116 ,</p>
<p>And in strong proof 117 of chastity well armed,</p>
<p>From love’s 118 weak childish bow she lives uncharmed 119 .</p>
<p>She will not stay 120 the siege of loving terms,</p>
<p>Nor bide 121 th’ encounter 122 of assailing eyes,</p>
<p>Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold 123 :</p>
<p>O, she is rich in beauty, only poor</p>
<p>That when she dies with beauty dies her store 124 .</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Then she hath sworn that she will still 125 live chaste?</p>
<p>ROMEO She hath, and in that sparing 126 makes huge waste,</p>
<p>For beauty starved 127 with her severity</p>
<p>Cuts beauty off from all posterity.</p>
<p>She is too fair 128 , too wise, wisely too fair,</p>
<p>To merit bliss by making me despair 129 .</p>
<p>She hath forsworn to 130 love, and in that vow</p>
<p>Do I live dead that live to tell it now.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.</p>
<p>ROMEO O, teach me how I should forget to think.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO By giving liberty unto thine eyes:</p>
<p>Examine other beauties.</p>
<p>ROMEO ’Tis the way</p>
<p>To call hers exquisite, in question more 131 :</p>
<p>These happy 132 masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows</p>
<p>Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.</p>
<p>He that is strucken 133 blind cannot forget</p>
<p>The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:</p>
<p>Show me a mistress that is passing 134 fair,</p>
<p>What doth her beauty serve, but as a note 135</p>
<p>Where I may read who passed 136 that passing fair?</p>
<p>Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO I’ll pay that doctrine 137 , or else die in debt.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
