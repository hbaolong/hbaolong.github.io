<p>Enter [the Lord ] Marshal and Aumerle</p>
<p>LORD MARSHAL My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford armed?</p>
<p>AUMERLE Yea, at all points 188 , and longs to enter in.</p>
<p>LORD MARSHAL The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully 189 and bold,</p>
<p>Stays 190 but the summons of the appellant 191 ’s trumpet.</p>
<p>AUMERLE Why, then, the champions 192 are prepared, and stay</p>
<p>For nothing but his majesty’s approach.</p>
<p>Flourish 193 . Enter King, Gaunt, Bushy, Bagot, Green and others.
[When they are set 194 , ] then Mowbray in armour and [a ] Herald</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Marshal, demand 195 of yonder champion</p>
<p>The cause of his arrival here in arms.</p>
<p>Ask him his name and orderly 196 proceed</p>
<p>To swear him in the justice of his cause.</p>
<p>LORD MARSHAL In God’s name and the king’s, say who thou art</p>
<p>And why thou com’st thus knightly clad in arms,</p>
<p>Against what man thou com’st, and what’s thy quarrel 197 .</p>
<p>Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thine oath,</p>
<p>As so defend 198 thee heaven and thy valour!</p>
<p>MOWBRAY My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,</p>
<p>Who hither comes engagèd by my oath ——</p>
<p>Which heaven defend a knight should violate! ——</p>
<p>Both to defend my loyalty and truth</p>
<p>To God, my king and his succeeding 199 issue 200 ,</p>
<p>Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me,</p>
<p>And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,</p>
<p>To prove him, in defending of myself,</p>
<p>A traitor to my God, my king, and me.</p>
<p>And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!</p>
<p>Tucket 201 . Enter Hereford [Bullingbrook ] and Herald</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,</p>
<p>Both who he is and why he cometh hither</p>
<p>Thus plated 202 in habiliments 203 of war,</p>
<p>And formally, according to our law,</p>
<p>Depose him 204 in the justice of his cause.</p>
<p>LORD MARSHAL What is thy name? And wherefore 205 com’st thou
hither,</p>
<p>To Bullingbrook</p>
<p>Before King Richard in his royal lists?</p>
<p>Against whom com’st thou? And what’s thy quarrel?</p>
<p>Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby</p>
<p>Am I, who ready here do stand in arms</p>
<p>To prove, by heaven’s grace and my body’s valour,</p>
<p>In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,</p>
<p>That he’s a traitor, foul and dangerous,</p>
<p>To God of heaven, King Richard and to me.</p>
<p>And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!</p>
<p>LORD MARSHAL On pain of death, no person be so bold</p>
<p>Or daring-hardy 206 as to touch 207 the lists,</p>
<p>Except the marshal and such officers</p>
<p>Appointed to direct these fair 208 designs.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Lord Marshal, let me kiss my sovereign’s hand,</p>
<p>And bow my knee before his majesty.</p>
<p>For Mowbray and myself are like two men</p>
<p>That vow a long and weary pilgrimage,</p>
<p>Then let us take a ceremonious leave</p>
<p>And loving farewell of our several 209 friends.</p>
<p>LORD MARSHAL The appellant in all duty greets your highness,</p>
<p>And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD We will descend and fold him in our arms.</p>
<p>Comes down and embraces Bullingbrook</p>
<p>Cousin of Hereford, as 210 thy cause is just,</p>
<p>So be thy fortune in this royal fight 211 !</p>
<p>Farewell, my blood 212 , which if today thou shed,</p>
<p>Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK O, let no noble eye profane 213 a tear</p>
<p>For me, if I be gored with Mowbray’s spear.</p>
<p>As confident as is the falcon’s flight</p>
<p>Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.——</p>
<p>My loving lord, I take my leave of you.——</p>
<p>To Richard</p>
<p>Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle,</p>
<p>Not sick, although I have to do with death,</p>
<p>But lusty 214 , young, and cheerly 215 drawing breath.</p>
<p>Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet 216</p>
<p>The daintiest 217 last, to make the end most sweet.——</p>
<p>O thou, the earthy author of my blood,</p>
<p>To Gaunt</p>
<p>Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate 218 ,</p>
<p>Doth with a twofold 219 rigour lift me up</p>
<p>To reach at victory above my head,</p>
<p>Add proof 220 unto mine armour with thy prayers,</p>
<p>And with thy blessings steel my lance’s point,</p>
<p>That it may enter Mowbray’s waxen 221 coat,</p>
<p>And furbish 222 new the name of John a Gaunt,</p>
<p>Even in the lusty ’haviour 223 of his son.</p>
<p>GAUNT Heaven in thy good cause make thee prosp’rous!</p>
<p>Be swift like lightning in the execution,</p>
<p>And let thy blows, doubly redoublèd,</p>
<p>Fall like amazing 224 thunder on the casque 225</p>
<p>Of thy amazed pernicious 226 enemy,</p>
<p>Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Mine innocence and Saint George 227 to thrive!</p>
<p>MOWBRAY However heaven or fortune cast my lot,</p>
<p>There lives or dies, true to King Richard’s throne,</p>
<p>A loyal, just and upright gentleman.</p>
<p>Never did captive with a freer heart</p>
<p>Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace</p>
<p>His golden uncontrolled enfranchisement 228</p>
<p>More than my dancing soul doth celebrate</p>
<p>This feast of battle with mine adversary.</p>
<p>Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,</p>
<p>Take from my mouth the wish of happy years.</p>
<p>As gentle 229 and as jocund 230 as to jest 231</p>
<p>Go I to fight. Truth hath a quiet breast.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Farewell, my lord. Securely 232 I espy</p>
<p>Virtue with valour couchèd 233 in thine eye.</p>
<p>Order 234 the trial, marshal, and begin.</p>
<p>LORD MARSHAL Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,</p>
<p>Receive thy lance. And heaven defend thy right!</p>
<p>Attendant gives a lance to Bullingbrook</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Strong as a tower, in hope I cry ‘Amen’.</p>
<p>LORD MARSHAL Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.</p>
<p>Attendant gives a lance to Mowbray</p>
<p>FIRST HERALD Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,</p>
<p>Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,</p>
<p>On pain to be found false and recreant 235 ,</p>
<p>To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,</p>
<p>A traitor to his God, his king and him 236 ,</p>
<p>And dares him to set forwards to the fight.</p>
<p>SECOND HERALD Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,</p>
<p>On pain to be found false and recreant,</p>
<p>Both to defend himself and to approve 237</p>
<p>Henry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,</p>
<p>To God, his sovereign and to him 238 disloyal,</p>
<p>Courageously and with a free desire</p>
<p>Attending 239 but the signal to begin.</p>
<p>A charge 240 sounded</p>
<p>LORD MARSHAL Sound trumpets, and set forward, combatants.</p>
<p>Stay 241 , the king hath thrown his warder 242 down.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Let them lay by 243 their helmets and their spears,</p>
<p>And both return 244 back to their chairs again.</p>
<p>Withdraw with us, and let the trumpets sound</p>
<p>While we return these dukes what we decree.</p>
<p>A long flourish</p>
<p>Draw near, and list 245 what with our council we have done.</p>
<p>For that 246 our kingdom’s earth should not be soiled</p>
<p>With that dear 247 blood which it hath fosterèd,</p>
<p>And for 248 our eyes do hate the dire aspect 249</p>
<p>Of civil wounds ploughed up with neighbours’ swords,</p>
<p>Which so roused up with boist’rous 250 untuned drums,</p>
<p>With harsh resounding trumpets’ dreadful bray,</p>
<p>And grating shock 251 of wrathful iron arms,</p>
<p>Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace</p>
<p>And make us wade even in our kindred’s blood:</p>
<p>Therefore, we banish you our territories.</p>
<p>You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of death,</p>
<p>Till twice five summers have enriched our fields</p>
<p>Shall not regreet 252 our fair dominions,</p>
<p>But tread the stranger 253 paths of banishment.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Your will be done. This must my comfort be:</p>
<p>That sun that warms you here shall shine on me,</p>
<p>And those his golden beams to you here lent</p>
<p>Shall point on me and gild my banishment.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,</p>
<p>Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:</p>
<p>The sly 254 slow hours shall not determinate 255</p>
<p>The dateless limit 256 of thy dear 257 exile.</p>
<p>The hopeless word of ‘never to return’</p>
<p>Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life 258 .</p>
<p>MOWBRAY A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,</p>
<p>And all unlooked for 259 from your highness’ mouth.</p>
<p>A dearer merit 260 , not so deep a maim 261</p>
<p>As to be cast forth in the common 262 air,</p>
<p>Have I deservèd at your highness’ hands.</p>
<p>The language I have learned these forty years,</p>
<p>My native English, now I must forgo,</p>
<p>And now my tongue’s use is to me no more</p>
<p>Than an unstringèd viol or a harp,</p>
<p>Or like a cunning 263 instrument cased up,</p>
<p>Or, being open 264 , put into his hands</p>
<p>That knows no touch 265 to tune the harmony.</p>
<p>Within my mouth you have enjailed my tongue,</p>
<p>Doubly portcullised 266 with my teeth and lips,</p>
<p>And dull unfeeling barren ignorance</p>
<p>Is made my jailer to attend on me.</p>
<p>I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,</p>
<p>Too far in years to be a pupil now.</p>
<p>What is thy sentence then but speechless death,</p>
<p>Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?</p>
<p>KING RICHARD It boots 267 thee not to be compassionate 268 .</p>
<p>After our sentence, plaining 269 comes too late.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY Then thus I turn me from my country’s light</p>
<p>To dwell in solemn 270 shades of endless night.</p>
<p>Starts to go</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Return again, and take an oath with thee.</p>
<p>Lay on our royal sword your banished hands;</p>
<p>Swear by the duty that you owe to heaven ——</p>
<p>Our part therein 271 we banish with yourselves ——</p>
<p>To keep the oath that we administer:</p>
<p>You never shall, so help you truth and heaven,</p>
<p>Embrace each other’s love in banishment,</p>
<p>Nor ever look upon each other’s face,</p>
<p>Nor ever write, regreet 272 , or reconcile</p>
<p>This louring 273 tempest of your home-bred hate,</p>
<p>Nor ever by advisèd 274 purpose meet</p>
<p>To plot, contrive, or complot 275 any ill</p>
<p>Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK I swear.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY And I, to keep all this.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Norfolk, so far as 276 to mine enemy:</p>
<p>By this time, had the king permitted us,</p>
<p>One of our souls had wandered in the air,</p>
<p>Banished this frail sepulchre 277 of our flesh,</p>
<p>As now our flesh is banished from this land.</p>
<p>Confess thy treasons ere thou fly 278 this realm:</p>
<p>Since thou hast far to go, bear not along</p>
<p>The clogging 279 burden of a guilty soul.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY No, Bullingbrook. If ever I were traitor,</p>
<p>My name be blotted from the book of life,</p>
<p>And I from heaven banished as from hence!</p>
<p>But what thou art, heaven, thou, and I do know,</p>
<p>And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue 280 .</p>
<p>Farewell, my liege, now no way can I stray 281 :</p>
<p>Save 282 back to England, all the world’s my way.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Uncle, even in the glasses 283 of thine eyes</p>
<p>To Gaunt</p>
<p>I see thy grievèd heart. Thy sad aspect 284</p>
<p>Hath from the number of his banished years</p>
<p>Plucked four away.—— Six frozen winters spent,</p>
<p>To Bullingbrook</p>
<p>Return with welcome home from banishment.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK How long a time lies in one little word!</p>
<p>Four lagging winters and four wanton 285 springs</p>
<p>End in a word: such is the breath of kings.</p>
<p>GAUNT I thank my liege, that in regard of me</p>
<p>He shortens four years of my son’s exile.</p>
<p>But little vantage 286 shall I reap thereby,</p>
<p>For ere the six years that he hath to spend</p>
<p>Can change their moons and bring their times 287 about</p>
<p>My oil-dried 288 lamp and time-bewasted 289 light</p>
<p>Shall be extinct 290 with age and endless night.</p>
<p>My inch of taper 291 will be burnt and done,</p>
<p>And blindfold death 292 not let me see my son.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.</p>
<p>GAUNT But not a minute, king, that thou canst give.</p>
<p>Shorten my days thou canst with sudden sorrow,</p>
<p>And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow.</p>
<p>Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,</p>
<p>But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage 293 .</p>
<p>Thy word is current 294 with him for my death 295 ,</p>
<p>But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Thy son is banished upon good advice 296 ,</p>
<p>Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict 297 gave.</p>
<p>Why at our justice seem’st thou then to lour 298 ?</p>
<p>GAUNT Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.</p>
<p>You urged me as a judge, but I had rather</p>
<p>You would have bid me argue like a father.</p>
<p>Alas, I looked when 299 some of you should say</p>
<p>I was too strict to make mine own away 300 .</p>
<p>But you gave leave 301 to my unwilling tongue,</p>
<p>Against my will to do myself this wrong.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Cousin, farewell, and, uncle, bid him so.</p>
<p>Six years we banish him, and he shall go. Flourish .</p>
<p>Exeunt [Richard and Attendants ]</p>
<p>AUMERLE Cousin, farewell. What presence must not know 302 ,</p>
<p>To Bullingbrook</p>
<p>From where you do remain let paper 303 show.</p>
<p>LORD MARSHAL My lord, no leave take I, for I will ride</p>
<p>To Bullingbrook</p>
<p>As far as land will let me, by your side.</p>
<p>GAUNT O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words</p>
<p>To Bullingbrook</p>
<p>That thou return’st no greeting to thy friends?</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK I have too few 304 to take my leave of you,</p>
<p>When the tongue’s office 305 should be prodigal 306</p>
<p>To breathe 307 th’abundant dolour 308 of the heart.</p>
<p>GAUNT Thy grief 309 is but thy absence for a time 310 .</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Joy absent, grief is present for that time.</p>
<p>GAUNT What is six winters? They are quickly gone.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK To men in joy. But grief makes one hour ten.</p>
<p>GAUNT Call it a travel 311 that thou tak’st for pleasure.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK My heart will sigh when I miscall 312 it so,</p>
<p>Which finds it an enforcèd pilgrimage.</p>
<p>GAUNT The sullen 313 passage of thy weary steps</p>
<p>Esteem as foil 314 wherein thou art to set</p>
<p>The precious jewel of thy home return.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK O, who can hold a fire in his hand</p>
<p>By thinking on the frosty Caucasus 315 ?</p>
<p>Or cloy 316 the hungry edge of appetite</p>
<p>By bare imagination of a feast?</p>
<p>Or wallow naked in December snow</p>
<p>By thinking on fantastic 317 summer’s heat?</p>
<p>O, no, the apprehension 318 of the good</p>
<p>Gives but the greater feeling to the worse.</p>
<p>Fell 319 sorrow’s tooth doth never rankle 320 more</p>
<p>Than when it bites, but lanceth 321 not the sore.</p>
<p>GAUNT Come, come, my son, I’ll bring 322 thee on thy way.</p>
<p>Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Then England’s ground, farewell. Sweet soil, adieu 323
