<p>Enter Mistress Quickly, Simple and John Rugby</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY What, John Rugby! I pray thee go to the casement and
see if you can see my master, Master Doctor Caius, coming. If he do,
i’faith, and find anybody in the house, here will be an old 264 abusing
of God’s patience and the King’s English.</p>
<p>RUGBY I’ll go watch.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Go, and we’ll have a posset 265 for’t soon at night
266 , in faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal 267 fire.— [Exit Rugby ]
An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant shall come in house
withal 268 , and, I warrant you, no tell-tale nor no breed-bate 269 .
His worst fault is that he is given to prayer, he is something peevish
270 that way, but nobody but has his fault 271 . But let that pass.
Peter Simple you say your name is?</p>
<p>SIMPLE Ay, for fault of a better.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY And Master Slender’s your master?</p>
<p>SIMPLE Ay, forsooth.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Does he not wear a great round beard, like a glover
272 ’s paring-knife 273 ?</p>
<p>SIMPLE No, forsooth, he hath but a little wee face, with a little
yellow beard: a Cain 274 -coloured 275 beard.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY A softly-sprighted 276 man, is he not?</p>
<p>SIMPLE Ay, forsooth, but he is as tall a man of his hands 277 as any
is between this and his head 278 . He hath fought with a warrener 279
.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY How say you? O, I should remember him: does he not
hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?</p>
<p>SIMPLE Yes, indeed, does he.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune. Tell
Master Parson Evans I will do what I can for your master. Anne is a good
girl, and I wish—</p>
<p>RUGBY Out, alas! 280 Here comes my master.</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY We shall all be shent 281 . Run in here, good young
man, go into this closet 282 . He will not stay long. What, John Rugby?
John! What, John, I say?</p>
<p>To Simple</p>
<p>Simple goes into the closet</p>
<p>[Enter Rugby ]</p>
<p>Go, John, go inquire for my master. I doubt 283 he be not well, that
he comes not home.</p>
<p>[Exit Rugby ]</p>
<p>And down, down, adown-a 284 , etc.</p>
<p>She sings</p>
<p>[Enter Caius ]</p>
<p>CAIUS Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys 285 . Pray you, go and
vetch me in my closet une boîtie en vert 286 : a box, a green-a box. Do
intend 287 vat I speak? A green-a box.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Ay, forsooth, I’ll fetch it you.— I am glad he went
not in himself. If he had found the young man, he would have been
horn-mad 288 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>She goes into the closet</p>
<p>CAIUS Fe, fe, fe, fe, ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je m’en vais voir à
le Court la grande affaire 289 .</p>
<p>[Enter Mistress Quickly with a box ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Is it this, sir?</p>
<p>CAIUS Oui, mette-le au mon pocket. Dépêche 290 , quickly. Vere is dat
knave Rugby?</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY What, John Rugby? John?</p>
<p>[Enter Rugby ]</p>
<p>RUGBY Here, sir!</p>
<p>CAIUS You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby. Come, take-a your
rapier, and come after my heel to the court.</p>
<p>RUGBY ’Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.</p>
<p>CAIUS By my trot 291 , I tarry too long. Od’s me 292 , que ai-je
oublié 293 . Dere is some simples 294 in my closet dat I vill not for
the varld I shall leave behind.</p>
<p>He goes into the closet</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Ay me, he’ll find the young man there and be
mad.</p>
<p>CAIUS O diable 295 , diable ! Vat is in my closet? Villain, larron
296 ! Rugby,</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>my rapier!</p>
<p>Pulls Simple out</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Good master, be content.</p>
<p>CAIUS Wherefore shall I be content-a?</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY The young man is an honest man.</p>
<p>CAIUS What shall de honest man do in my closet? Dere is no honest man
dat shall come in my closet.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY I beseech you be not so phlegmatic 297 . Hear the
truth of it: he came of 298 an errand to me, from Parson Hugh.</p>
<p>CAIUS Vell.</p>
<p>SIMPLE Ay, forsooth, to desire her to—</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Peace, I pray you.</p>
<p>CAIUS Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale.</p>
<p>To Mistress Quickly/To Simple</p>
<p>SIMPLE To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to speak a good
word to Mistress Anne Page for my master in the way of marriage.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY This is all, indeed, la! But I’ll ne’er put my
finger in the fire, and need not 299 .</p>
<p>CAIUS Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baillez 300 me some paper. Tarry
you a little-a while.</p>
<p>Rugby brings paper. Caius writes</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY I am glad he is so quiet. If he had been throughly
moved, you should have heard him so loud and so melancholy 301 . But
notwithstanding, man, I’ll do you 302 your master what good I can: and
the very yea and the no 303 is, the French doctor, my master — I may
call him my master, look you, for I keep his house, and I wash, wring,
brew, bake, scour, dress meat 304 and drink, make the beds and do all
myself—</p>
<p>Aside to Simple</p>
<p>SIMPLE ’Tis a great charge 305 to come under one body’s hand.</p>
<p>Aside to Mistress Quickly</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Are you avised 306 o’that? You shall find it 307 a
great charge, and to be up early and down late. But notwithstanding — to
tell you in your ear, I would have no words of it 308 — my master
himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page. But notwithstanding that, I
know Anne’s mind — that’s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>Aside to Simple</p>
<p>CAIUS You jack’nape 309 , give-a this letter to Sir Hugh. By gar 310
, it is a shallenge. I will cut his troat in de park 311 , and I will
teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest to meddle or make 312 .— You may be
gone. It is not good you tarry here.— By gar, I will cut all his two
stones 313 . By gar, he shall not have a stone to throw at his dog.</p>
<p>Gives a letter to Simple</p>
<p>To Simple</p>
<p>[Exit Simple ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Alas, he speaks but for his friend.</p>
<p>CAIUS It is no matter-a ver 314 dat: do not you tell-a me dat I shall
have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I vill kill de Jack 315 priest: and I
have appointed mine host of de Jarteer 316 to measure our weapon 317 .
By gar, I will myself have Anne Page.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We
must give folks leave to prate 318 . What the good-year 319 !</p>
<p>CAIUS Rugby, come to the court with me.— By gar, if I have not Anne
Page, I shall turn your head out of my door. Follow my heels, Rugby.</p>
<p>To Mistress Quickly</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY You shall have An 320 —</p>
<p>[Exeunt Caius and Rugby ]</p>
<p>fool’s-head of your own. No, I know Anne’s mind for that: never a
woman in Windsor knows more of Anne’s mind than I do, nor can do more
than I do with her, I thank heaven.</p>
<p>FENTON Who’s within there, ho?</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Who’s there, I trow 321 ? Come near 322 the house, I
pray you.</p>
<p>[Enter Fenton ]</p>
<p>FENTON How now, good woman? How dost thou?</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY The better that it pleases your good worship to
ask.</p>
<p>FENTON What news? How does pretty Mistress Anne?</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest 323 ,
and gentle, and one that is your friend 324 — I can tell you that by the
way — I praise heaven for it.</p>
<p>FENTON Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? Shall I not lose my
suit?</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but
notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I’ll be sworn on a book 325 she loves
you. Have not your worship a wart above your eye?</p>
<p>FENTON Yes, marry, have I. What of that?</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Well, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such
another Nan 326 327 —but, I detest 328 , an honest maid as ever broke
bread. We had an hour’s talk of that wart. I shall never laugh but in
that maid’s company. But, indeed, she is given too much to allicholy 329
and musing. But for you — well, go to 330 —</p>
<p>FENTON Well, I shall see her today. Hold, there’s money for thee: let
me have thy voice 331 in my behalf. If thou see’st her before me,
commend me—</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Will I? I’faith, that we will. And I will tell your
worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence 332 , and of
other wooers.</p>
<p>FENTON Well, farewell, I am in great haste now.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Farewell to your worship.</p>
<p>[Exit Fenton ]</p>
<p>Truly, an honest gentleman. But Anne loves him not. For I know Anne’s
mind as well as another does. Out upon’t 333 , what have I forgot?</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
