<h4 id="scene-1-217-running-scene-2">Scene 1 217 / running scene 2</h4>
<p>Enter before Angiers 218 , [on one side ] Philip King of France,
Lewis [the ] Dauphin 219 ,</p>
<p>Constance, [and ] Arthur, [on the other side ] Austria 220</p>
<p>With their forces</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.—</p>
<p>Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood 221 ,</p>
<p>Richard that robbed the lion of his heart</p>
<p>And fought the holy wars in Palestine 222 ,</p>
<p>By 223 this brave duke came early to his grave:</p>
<p>And for amends to his posterity 224 ,</p>
<p>At our importance 225 hither is he come,</p>
<p>To spread 226 his colours 227 , boy, in thy behalf,</p>
<p>And to rebuke 228 the usurpation</p>
<p>Of thy unnatural 229 uncle, English John:</p>
<p>Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.</p>
<p>ARTHUR God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion’s death</p>
<p>To Austria</p>
<p>The rather that you give his offspring 230 life,</p>
<p>Shadowing 231 their right under your wings of war:</p>
<p>I give you welcome with a powerless 232 hand,</p>
<p>But with a heart full of unstainèd 233 love:</p>
<p>Welcome before the gates of Angiers, Duke.</p>
<p>LEWIS A noble boy: who would not do thee right?</p>
<p>AUSTRIA Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous 234 kiss,</p>
<p>As seal to this indenture 235 of my love:</p>
<p>That to my home I will no more return</p>
<p>Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,</p>
<p>Together with that pale 236 , that white-faced shore 237 ,</p>
<p>Whose foot spurns 238 back the ocean’s roaring tides</p>
<p>And coops 239 from other lands her islanders,</p>
<p>Even till that England, hedged in with the main 240 ,</p>
<p>That water-wallèd bulwark 241 , still 242 secure</p>
<p>And confident from 243 foreign purposes 244 ,</p>
<p>Even till that utmost corner of the west</p>
<p>Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,</p>
<p>Will I not think of home, but follow arms 245 .</p>
<p>CONSTANCE O, take his mother’s thanks, a widow’s thanks,</p>
<p>Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength</p>
<p>To make a more requital to 246 your love.</p>
<p>AUSTRIA The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords</p>
<p>In such a just and charitable war.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent 247</p>
<p>Against the brows 248 of this resisting town.</p>
<p>Call for our chiefest men of discipline 249 ,</p>
<p>To cull 250 the plots 251 of best advantages 252 :</p>
<p>We’ll lay before this town our royal bones,</p>
<p>Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen’s blood,</p>
<p>But we will 253 make it subject to 254 this boy.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE Stay 255 for an answer to your embassy 256 ,</p>
<p>Lest unadvised 257 you stain your swords with blood:</p>
<p>My lord Chatillon may from England bring</p>
<p>That right in peace which here we urge in war,</p>
<p>And then we shall repent each drop of blood</p>
<p>That hot rash haste so indirectly 258 shed.</p>
<p>Enter Chatillon</p>
<p>KING PHILIP A wonder, lady: lo 259 , upon thy wish,</p>
<p>Our messenger Chatillon is arrived.—</p>
<p>What England 260 says, say briefly, gentle 261 lord:</p>
<p>We coldly 262 pause for thee: Chatillon, speak.</p>
<p>CHATILLON Then turn your forces from this paltry siege,</p>
<p>And stir them up against 263 a mightier task:</p>
<p>England, impatient of 264 your just demands,</p>
<p>Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,</p>
<p>Whose leisure 265 I have stayed 266 , have given him time</p>
<p>To land his legions 267 all as soon as I:</p>
<p>His marches are expedient 268 to this town,</p>
<p>His forces strong, his soldiers confident:</p>
<p>With him along is come the Mother-Queen 269 ,</p>
<p>An Ate 270 stirring him to blood and strife:</p>
<p>With her her niece 271 , the lady Blanche of Spain 272 :</p>
<p>With them a bastard of the king’s deceased 273 ,</p>
<p>And all th’unsettled humours 274 275 of the land,</p>
<p>Rash, inconsiderate 276 , fiery voluntaries 277 ,</p>
<p>With ladies’ faces 278 and fierce dragons’ spleens 279 ,</p>
<p>Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,</p>
<p>Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs 280 ,</p>
<p>To make a hazard of 281 new fortunes here:</p>
<p>In brief, a braver 282 choice 283 of dauntless spirits</p>
<p>Than now the English bottoms 284 have waft 285 o’er</p>
<p>Did never float upon the swelling tide,</p>
<p>To do offence and scathe 286 in Christendom.</p>
<p>Drum beats</p>
<p>The interruption of their churlish 287 drums</p>
<p>Cuts off more circumstance 288 : they are at hand:</p>
<p>To parley 289 or to fight therefore prepare.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP How much unlooked-for is this expedition 290 !</p>
<p>AUSTRIA By how much unexpected, by so much</p>
<p>We must awake endeavour for defence,</p>
<p>For courage mounteth with occasion 291 :</p>
<p>Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.</p>
<p>Enter King [John ] of England, [the ] Bastard, Queen [Elinor ],
Blanche, Pembroke and others 292</p>
<p>KING JOHN Peace be to France, if France in peace permit</p>
<p>Our just and lineal 293 entrance to our own 294 ;</p>
<p>If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,</p>
<p>Whiles we, God’s wrathful agent, do correct</p>
<p>Their proud contempt that beats 295 his peace to heaven.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Peace be to England, if that 296 war return</p>
<p>From France to England, there to live in peace:</p>
<p>England we love, and for that England’s 297 sake</p>
<p>With burden of our armour here we sweat:</p>
<p>This toil 298 of ours should be a work 299 of thine;</p>
<p>But thou from loving England art so far,</p>
<p>That thou hast underwrought 300 his 301 lawful king,</p>
<p>Cut off the sequence of posterity 302 ,</p>
<p>Outfacèd 303 infant state 304 , and done a rape</p>
<p>Upon the maiden virtue of the crown:</p>
<p>Look here upon thy brother Geoffrey’s 305 face:</p>
<p>Indicates Arthur</p>
<p>These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his;</p>
<p>This little abstract 306 doth contain that large</p>
<p>Which died in Geoffrey, and the hand of time</p>
<p>Shall draw this brief 307 into as huge a volume:</p>
<p>That Geoffrey was thy elder brother born,</p>
<p>And this his son: England was Geoffrey’s right,</p>
<p>And this is Geoffrey’s in the name of God:</p>
<p>How comes it then that thou art called a king,</p>
<p>When living blood doth in these temples beat</p>
<p>Which owe 308 the crown that thou o’ermasterest?</p>
<p>KING JOHN From whom hast thou this great commission 309 , France,</p>
<p>To draw my answer from thy articles 310 ?</p>
<p>KING PHILIP From that supernal 311 judge 312 that stirs good
thoughts</p>
<p>In any breast of strong authority,</p>
<p>To look into the blots and stains of right:</p>
<p>That judge hath made me guardian to this boy,</p>
<p>Under whose warrant I impeach 313 thy wrong,</p>
<p>And by whose help I mean to chastise it.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Alack 314 , thou dost usurp authority.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Excuse it is to beat usurping down 315 .</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?</p>
<p>CONSTANCE Let me make answer: thy usurping son.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR Out 316 , insolent! Thy bastard shall be king,</p>
<p>That thou mayst be a queen, and check 317 the world.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE My bed was ever to thy son as true</p>
<p>As thine was to thy husband, and this boy</p>
<p>Liker in feature 318 to his father Geoffrey</p>
<p>Than thou and John, in manners 319 being as like</p>
<p>As rain to water, or devil to his dam 320 .</p>
<p>My boy a bastard? By my soul I think</p>
<p>His father never was so true begot:</p>
<p>It cannot be, an if 321 thou wert his mother 322 .</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR There’s a good mother, boy, that blots 323 thy
father.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE There’s a good grandam 324 , boy, that would blot 325
thee.</p>
<p>AUSTRIA Peace!</p>
<p>BASTARD Hear the crier 326 .</p>
<p>AUSTRIA What the devil art thou?</p>
<p>BASTARD One that will play the devil 327 , sir, with you,</p>
<p>An a 328 may catch 329 your hide 330 and you alone:</p>
<p>You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,</p>
<p>Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard 331 .</p>
<p>I’ll smoke 332 your skin-coat an 333 I catch you right:</p>
<p>Sirrah, look to’t 334 : i’faith I will, i’faith.</p>
<p>BLANCHE O, well did he become 335 that lion’s robe</p>
<p>That did disrobe the lion of that robe.</p>
<p>BASTARD It lies as sightly 336 on the back of him</p>
<p>As great Alcides 337 ’ shoes upon an ass:</p>
<p>But, ass, I’ll take that burden from your back,</p>
<p>Or lay on that 338 shall make your shoulders crack.</p>
<p>AUSTRIA What cracker 339 is this same that deafs 340 our ears</p>
<p>With this abundance of superfluous breath?</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Lewis, determine what we shall do straight 341 .</p>
<p>LEWIS Women and fools, break off your conference.</p>
<p>King John, this is the very sum 342 of all:</p>
<p>England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,</p>
<p>In right of Arthur do I claim of thee:</p>
<p>Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?</p>
<p>KING JOHN My life as soon: I do defy thee, France.</p>
<p>Arthur of Bretagne 343 , yield thee to my hand,</p>
<p>And out of my dear love I’ll give thee more</p>
<p>Than e’er the coward hand of France can win.</p>
<p>Submit thee, boy.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR Come to thy grandam, child.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE Do, child, go to it 344 grandam, child:</p>
<p>Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will</p>
<p>Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig 345 :</p>
<p>There’s a good grandam.</p>
<p>ARTHUR Good my mother, peace.</p>
<p>I would that I were low laid in my grave:</p>
<p>I am not worth this coil 346 that’s made for me.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR His mother shames 347 him so, poor boy, he weeps.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE Now shame upon you, whe’er she does or no:</p>
<p>His grandam’s wrongs, and not his mother’s shames,</p>
<p>Draws those heaven-moving pearls 348 from his poor eyes,</p>
<p>Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee 349 :</p>
<p>Ay, with these crystal beads 350 heaven shall be bribed</p>
<p>To do him justice and revenge on you.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR Thou monstrous 351 slanderer of heaven and earth!</p>
<p>CONSTANCE Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth,</p>
<p>Call not me slanderer: thou and thine usurp</p>
<p>The dominations 352 , royalties 353 , and rights</p>
<p>Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eldest son’s son 354 ,</p>
<p>Infortunate 355 in nothing but in thee:</p>
<p>Thy sins are visited 356 in this poor child:</p>
<p>The canon of the law 357 is laid on him,</p>
<p>Being but 358 the second generation</p>
<p>Removèd 359 from thy sin-conceiving womb.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Bedlam 360 , have done.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE I have but this to say:</p>
<p>That he is not only plaguèd for her sin,</p>
<p>But God hath made her sin 361 and her the plague</p>
<p>On this removèd issue 362 , plagued for 363 her,</p>
<p>And with her plague her sin: his injury 364</p>
<p>Her injury the beadle 365 to her sin,</p>
<p>All punished in the person of this child,</p>
<p>And all for 366 her: a plague upon her!</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR Thou unadvisèd 367 scold, I can produce</p>
<p>A will that bars the title 368 of thy son.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE Ay, who doubts that? A will: a wicked will,</p>
<p>A woman’s will 369 , a cankered 370 grandam’s will!</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Peace, lady: pause, or be more temperate 371 :</p>
<p>It ill beseems 372 this presence 373 to cry aim 374</p>
<p>To these ill-tunèd 375 repetitions 376 .</p>
<p>Some trumpet 377 summon hither to the walls</p>
<p>These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak</p>
<p>Whose title they admit 378 , Arthur’s or John’s.</p>
<p>Trumpet sounds. Enter a Citizen upon the walls [with others ]</p>
<p>CITIZEN Who is it that hath warned 379 us to the walls?</p>
<p>KING PHILIP ’Tis France, for England 380 .</p>
<p>KING JOHN England for itself:</p>
<p>You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects—</p>
<p>KING PHILIP You loving men of Angiers, Arthur’s subjects,</p>
<p>Our trumpet called you to this gentle 381 parle 382 —</p>
<p>KING JOHN For our advantage; therefore hear us first:</p>
<p>These flags of France that are advancèd 383 here</p>
<p>Before the eye and prospect 384 of your town,</p>
<p>Have hither marched to your endamagement 385 .</p>
<p>The cannons have their bowels 386 full of wrath,</p>
<p>And ready mounted are they to spit forth</p>
<p>Their iron indignation gainst your walls:</p>
<p>All preparation for a bloody siege</p>
<p>And merciless proceeding by these French</p>
<p>Confronts your city’s eyes, your winking gates:</p>
<p>And but for our approach, those sleeping stones 387 ,</p>
<p>That as a waist 388 doth girdle you about,</p>
<p>By the compulsion of their ordinance 389</p>
<p>By this time from their fixèd beds of lime 390</p>
<p>Had been dishabited 391 , and wide havoc made</p>
<p>For bloody power 392 to rush upon your peace.</p>
<p>But on the sight of us your lawful king,</p>
<p>Who painfully with much expedient 393 march</p>
<p>Have brought a countercheck 394 before your gates,</p>
<p>To save unscratched your city’s threatened cheeks,</p>
<p>Behold, the French, amazed 395 , vouchsafe 396 a parle:</p>
<p>And now instead of bullets 397 wrapped in fire</p>
<p>To make a shaking fever in your walls,</p>
<p>They shoot but calm words, folded up in smoke 398 ,</p>
<p>To make a faithless error 399 in your ears,</p>
<p>Which trust accordingly 400 , kind citizens,</p>
<p>And let us in. Your king, whose laboured 401 spirits,</p>
<p>Forwearied 402 in this action of swift speed,</p>
<p>Craves harbourage 403 within your city walls.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP When I have said 404 , make answer to us both.</p>
<p>Lo 405 , in this right hand, whose protection</p>
<p>He takes Arthur’s hand</p>
<p>Is most divinely vowed upon the right 406</p>
<p>Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,</p>
<p>Son to the elder brother of this man,</p>
<p>And king o’er him and all that he enjoys 407 :</p>
<p>For 408 this downtrodden equity 409 , we tread 410</p>
<p>In warlike march these greens 411 before your town,</p>
<p>Being no further enemy to you</p>
<p>Than the constraint 412 of hospitable zeal</p>
<p>In the relief of this oppressèd child</p>
<p>Religiously provokes. Be pleasèd then</p>
<p>To pay that duty which you truly owe</p>
<p>To him that owes 413 it, namely this young prince:</p>
<p>And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,</p>
<p>Save 414 in aspect 415 , hath all offence 416 sealed up 417 :</p>
<p>Our cannons’ malice vainly shall be spent 418</p>
<p>Against th’invulnerable clouds of heaven,</p>
<p>And with a blessèd and unvexed 419 retire 420 ,</p>
<p>With unhacked 421 swords and helmets all unbruised,</p>
<p>We will bear home that lusty 422 blood again</p>
<p>Which here we came to spout against your town,</p>
<p>And leave your children, wives, and you in peace.</p>
<p>But if you fondly 423 pass 424 our proffered offer,</p>
<p>’Tis not the roundure 425 of your old-faced walls</p>
<p>Can hide you from our messengers of war 426 ,</p>
<p>Though 427 all these English and their discipline 428</p>
<p>Were harboured in their rude 429 circumference:</p>
<p>Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,</p>
<p>In that behalf which 430 we have challenged it?</p>
<p>Or shall we give the signal to our rage,</p>
<p>And stalk in blood to our possession?</p>
<p>CITIZEN In brief, we are the King of England’s subjects:</p>
<p>For him, and in his right, we hold this town.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.</p>
<p>CITIZEN That can we not: but he that proves 431 the king,</p>
<p>To him will we prove loyal: till that time</p>
<p>Have we rammed up our gates against the world.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Doth not the crown of England prove the king?</p>
<p>And if not that, I bring you witnesses:</p>
<p>Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England’s breed—</p>
<p>BASTARD Bastards, and else 432 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>KING JOHN To verify our title with their lives.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP As many and as well-born bloods 433 as those—</p>
<p>BASTARD Some bastards too.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Stand in his face 434 to contradict his claim.</p>
<p>CITIZEN Till you compound 435 whose right is worthiest,</p>
<p>We for 436 the worthiest hold 437 the right from both.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Then God forgive the sin of all those souls</p>
<p>That to their everlasting residence 438 ,</p>
<p>Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet 439</p>
<p>In dreadful 440 trial 441 of our kingdom’s king.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Amen, amen. Mount, chevaliers 442 : to arms!</p>
<p>BASTARD Saint George 443 , that swinged 444 the dragon, and e’er
since</p>
<p>Sits on’s horseback at mine hostess 445 ’ door 446 ,</p>
<p>Teach us some fence 447 !— Sirrah, were I at home</p>
<p>To Austria</p>
<p>At your den, sirrah, with your lioness 448 ,</p>
<p>I would set an ox-head to your lion’s hide 449 ,</p>
<p>And make a monster 450 of you.</p>
<p>AUSTRIA Peace, no more.</p>
<p>BASTARD O tremble, for you hear the lion roar.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Up higher to the plain, where we’ll set forth</p>
<p>In best appointment 451 all our regiments.</p>
<p>BASTARD Speed then, to take advantage 452 of the field.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP It shall be so, and at the other hill</p>
<p>Command the rest to stand. God and our right! 453</p>
<p>Exeunt [French and English forces ]</p>
<p>Citizens remain on the walls</p>
<p>Here after excursions 454 , enter [at one doo r] the Herald of France
with Trumpets 455 to the gates</p>
<p>FRENCH HERALD You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,</p>
<p>And let young Arthur Duke of Bretagne in,</p>
<p>Who by the hand of France 456 this day hath made</p>
<p>Much work for tears in many an English mother,</p>
<p>Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground:</p>
<p>Many a widow’s husband grovelling 457 lies,</p>
<p>Coldly embracing the discoloured earth:</p>
<p>And victory with little loss doth play</p>
<p>Upon the dancing banners of the French,</p>
<p>Who are at hand, triumphantly displayed 458 ,</p>
<p>To enter conquerors, and to proclaim</p>
<p>Arthur of Bretagne England’s king and yours.</p>
<p>Enter [at another door the ] English Herald, with Trumpets</p>
<p>ENGLISH HERALD Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:</p>
<p>King John, your king and England’s, doth approach,</p>
<p>Commander 459 of this hot malicious 460 day:</p>
<p>Their armours that marched hence 461 so silver-bright</p>
<p>Hither return all gilt 462 with Frenchmen’s blood:</p>
<p>There stuck no plume in any English crest 463</p>
<p>That is removèd by a staff 464 of France:</p>
<p>Our colours 465 do return in those same hands</p>
<p>That did display them when we first marched forth:</p>
<p>And like a jolly troop of huntsmen 466 come</p>
<p>Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,</p>
<p>Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:</p>
<p>Open your gates and give the victors way.</p>
<p>CITIZEN Heralds, from off our towers we might behold</p>
<p>This Citizen may be Hubert</p>
<p>From first to last, the onset and retire 467</p>
<p>Of both your armies, whose equality</p>
<p>By our best eyes cannot be censurèd 468 :</p>
<p>Blood hath bought blood, and blows have answered blows:</p>
<p>Strength matched with strength, and power confronted power:</p>
<p>Both are alike 469 , and both alike we like 470 .</p>
<p>One must prove greatest. While they weigh so even,</p>
<p>We hold our town for neither, yet for both.</p>
<p>Enter the two Kings with their powers, at several doors [King John
accompanied by the Bastard, Queen Elinor, Blanche; King Philip by Lewis
the Dauphin and Austria ]</p>
<p>KING JOHN France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?</p>
<p>Say, shall the current of our right run on,</p>
<p>Whose passage 471 , vexed with thy impediment,</p>
<p>Shall leave his native 472 channel and o’erswell 473</p>
<p>With course disturbed even thy confining shores,</p>
<p>Unless thou let his silver water keep</p>
<p>A peaceful progress 474 to the ocean.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood</p>
<p>In this hot trial more than we of France;</p>
<p>Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,</p>
<p>That sways 475 the earth this climate 476 overlooks,</p>
<p>Before we will lay down our just-borne 477 arms,</p>
<p>We’ll put thee down 478 , gainst whom these arms we bear,</p>
<p>Or add a royal number 479 to the dead,</p>
<p>Gracing the scroll that tells of 480 this war’s loss</p>
<p>With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.</p>
<p>BASTARD Ha, majesty! How high thy glory towers 481 ,</p>
<p>When the rich blood of kings is set on fire:</p>
<p>O, now doth Death line his dead chaps 482 with steel:</p>
<p>The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs:</p>
<p>And now he feasts, mousing 483 the flesh of men</p>
<p>In undetermined differences 484 of kings.</p>
<p>Why stand these royal fronts 485 amazèd thus?</p>
<p>Cry havoc 486 , kings: back to the stainèd field</p>
<p>You equal potents 487 , fiery kindled spirits!</p>
<p>Then let confusion 488 of one part 489 confirm</p>
<p>The other’s peace 490 : till then, blows, blood and death.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Whose party do the townsmen yet admit 491 ?</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Speak, citizens, for England. Who’s your king?</p>
<p>CITIZEN The King of England, when we know the king.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Know him in us, that here hold up 492 his right.</p>
<p>KING JOHN In us, that are our own great deputy</p>
<p>And bear possession of our person here 493 ,</p>
<p>Lord of our presence 494 , Angiers, and of you.</p>
<p>CITIZEN A greater power than we denies all this,</p>
<p>And till it be undoubted, we do lock</p>
<p>Our former scruple in our strong-barred gates:</p>
<p>Kings of 495 our fear, until our fears resolved</p>
<p>Be by some certain 496 king, purged and deposed 497 .</p>
<p>BASTARD By heaven, these scroyles 498 of Angiers flout 499 you,
kings,</p>
<p>And stand securely on their battlements,</p>
<p>As in a theatre, whence they gape and point</p>
<p>At your industrious 500 scenes and acts 501 of death.</p>
<p>Your royal presences be ruled by me:</p>
<p>Do like the mutines 502 of Jerusalem 503 ,</p>
<p>Be friends awhile, and both conjointly bend 504</p>
<p>Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town.</p>
<p>By east and west let France and England mount 505</p>
<p>Their battering cannon chargèd 506 to the mouths,</p>
<p>Till their soul-fearing 507 clamours have brawled down 508</p>
<p>The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:</p>
<p>I’d play 509 incessantly upon these jades 510 ,</p>
<p>Even till unfencèd 511 desolation 512</p>
<p>Leave them as naked as the vulgar 513 air:</p>
<p>That done, dissever your united strengths,</p>
<p>And part your mingled colours once again:</p>
<p>Turn face to face, and bloody point 514 to point:</p>
<p>Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth 515</p>
<p>Out of one side her happy minion 516 ,</p>
<p>To whom in favour she shall give the day 517 ,</p>
<p>And kiss him with a glorious victory:</p>
<p>How like you this wild 518 counsel, mighty states 519 ?</p>
<p>Smacks it not something 520 of the policy 521 ?</p>
<p>KING JOHN Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,</p>
<p>I like it well.— France, shall we knit 522 our powers,</p>
<p>And lay 523 this Angiers even with the ground,</p>
<p>Then after fight who 524 shall be king of it?</p>
<p>BASTARD An if 525 thou hast the mettle 526 of a king,</p>
<p>Being wronged as we are by this peevish 527 town,</p>
<p>Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,</p>
<p>As we will ours, against these saucy 528 walls,</p>
<p>And when that 529 we have dashed them to the ground,</p>
<p>Why then defy each other, and pell-mell 530 ,</p>
<p>Make work upon ourselves 531 , for heaven or hell 532 .</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Let it be so: say, where will you assault?</p>
<p>KING JOHN We from the west will send destruction</p>
<p>Into this city’s bosom.</p>
<p>AUSTRIA I from the north.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Our thunder 533 from the south</p>
<p>Shall rain their drift 534 of bullets on this town.</p>
<p>BASTARD O prudent discipline 535 ! From north to south:</p>
<p>Austria and France shoot in each other’s mouth:</p>
<p>I’ll stir them to it.— Come, away, away!</p>
<p>CITIZEN Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe 536 awhile to stay,</p>
<p>And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league 537 :</p>
<p>Win you this city without stroke or wound:</p>
<p>Rescue those breathing lives 538 to die in beds,</p>
<p>That here come sacrifices for the field.</p>
<p>Persever 539 not, but hear me, mighty kings.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Speak on with favour 540 : we are bent 541 to hear.</p>
<p>CITIZEN That daughter there of Spain, the lady Blanche,</p>
<p>Is niece to England: look upon the years 542</p>
<p>Of Lewis the dauphin and that lovely maid.</p>
<p>If lusty 543 love should go in quest of beauty,</p>
<p>Where should he find it fairer than in Blanche?</p>
<p>If zealous love should go in search of virtue,</p>
<p>Where should he find it purer than in Blanche?</p>
<p>If love ambitious sought a match of birth 544 ,</p>
<p>Whose veins bound 545 richer blood than Lady Blanche?</p>
<p>Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,</p>
<p>Is the young dauphin every way complete 546 :</p>
<p>If not complete of 547 , say he is not she 548 :</p>
<p>And she again wants 549 nothing, to name want,</p>
<p>If want it be not that she is not he 550 :</p>
<p>He is the half part of a blessèd man,</p>
<p>Left to be finishèd 551 by such as she:</p>
<p>And she a fair divided 552 excellence,</p>
<p>Whose fullness of perfection lies in him.</p>
<p>O, two such silver currents when they join</p>
<p>Do glorify the banks that bound them in:</p>
<p>And two such shores to two such streams made one,</p>
<p>Two such controlling bounds 553 shall you be, kings,</p>
<p>To these two princes 554 , if you marry them:</p>
<p>This union shall do more than battery 555 can</p>
<p>To our fast-closèd 556 gates: for at this match 557 ,</p>
<p>With swifter spleen 558 than powder 559 can enforce,</p>
<p>The mouth of passage 560 shall we fling wide ope 561 ,</p>
<p>And give you entrance: but without this match,</p>
<p>The sea enragèd is not half so deaf,</p>
<p>Lions more confident, mountains and rocks</p>
<p>More free from motion, no, not Death himself</p>
<p>In mortal 562 fury half so peremptory 563 ,</p>
<p>As we to keep this city.</p>
<p>BASTARD Here’s a stay 564</p>
<p>That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death</p>
<p>Out of his rags. Here’s a large mouth, indeed,</p>
<p>That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,</p>
<p>Talks as familiarly of roaring lions</p>
<p>As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs.</p>
<p>What cannoneer begot this lusty blood 565 ?</p>
<p>He speaks plain cannon 566 : fire, and smoke, and bounce 567 :</p>
<p>He gives the bastinado 568 with his tongue:</p>
<p>Our ears are cudgelled: not a word of his</p>
<p>But buffets 569 better than a fist of France:</p>
<p>Zounds 570 ! I was never so bethumped 571 with words</p>
<p>Since I first called my brother’s father dad 572 .</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR Son, list 573 to this conjunction 574 , make this
match,</p>
<p>Give with our niece a dowry large enough:</p>
<p>For, by this knot, thou shalt so surely tie</p>
<p>Thy now unsured 575 assurance to the crown</p>
<p>That yon 576 green 577 boy 578 shall have no sun 579 to ripe</p>
<p>The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.</p>
<p>I see a yielding in the looks of France:</p>
<p>Mark 580 how they whisper: urge them while their souls</p>
<p>Are capable of 581 this ambition,</p>
<p>Lest zeal 582 , now melted by the windy breath</p>
<p>Of soft petitions 583 , pity and remorse 584 ,</p>
<p>Cool and congeal again to what it was.</p>
<p>CITIZEN Why answer not the double majesties</p>
<p>This friendly treaty 585 of our threatened town?</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Speak England first, that hath been forward 586 first</p>
<p>To speak unto this city: what say you?</p>
<p>KING JOHN If that the dauphin there, thy princely son,</p>
<p>Can in this book of beauty read ‘I love 587’,</p>
<p>Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:</p>
<p>For Anjou 588 and fair Touraine, Maine, Poitiers,</p>
<p>And all that we upon this side the 589 sea —</p>
<p>Except this city now by us besieged —</p>
<p>Find liable 590 to our crown and dignity,</p>
<p>Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich</p>
<p>In titles, honours, and promotions 591 ,</p>
<p>As she in beauty, education, blood,</p>
<p>Holds hand with 592 any princess of the world.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP What say’st thou, boy? Look in the lady’s face.</p>
<p>LEWIS I do, my lord, and in her eye I find</p>
<p>A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,</p>
<p>The shadow 593 of myself formed in her eye:</p>
<p>Which, being but the shadow of your son 594 ,</p>
<p>Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow 595 :</p>
<p>I do protest I never loved myself</p>
<p>Till now infixèd 596 I beheld myself</p>
<p>Drawn in the flattering table 597 of her eye.</p>
<p>Whispers with Blanche</p>
<p>BASTARD Drawn 598 in the flattering table of her eye,</p>
<p>Hanged in the frowning wrinkle of her brow,</p>
<p>And quartered 599 in her heart, he doth espy 600</p>
<p>Himself love’s traitor: this is pity now,</p>
<p>That hanged and drawn and quartered there should be</p>
<p>In such a love 601 so vile a lout as he.</p>
<p>BLANCHE My uncle’s will 602 in this respect is mine:</p>
<p>If he see aught 603 in you that makes him like,</p>
<p>That anything 604 he sees which moves his liking,</p>
<p>I can with ease translate 605 it to my will:</p>
<p>Or if you will, to speak more properly 606 ,</p>
<p>I will enforce 607 it eas’ly to my love.</p>
<p>Further I will not flatter you, my lord,</p>
<p>That 608 all I see in you is worthy 609 love,</p>
<p>Than this: that nothing do I see in you,</p>
<p>Though churlish 610 thoughts themselves should be your judge,</p>
<p>That I can find should merit 611 any hate.</p>
<p>KING JOHN What say these young ones? What say you, my niece?</p>
<p>BLANCHE That she is bound in honour still 612 to do</p>
<p>What you in wisdom still vouchsafe 613 to say.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Speak then, Prince Dauphin, can you love this lady?</p>
<p>LEWIS Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love,</p>
<p>For I do love her most unfeignedly 614 .</p>
<p>KING JOHN Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,</p>
<p>Poitiers and Anjou, these five provinces,</p>
<p>With her to thee, and this addition more:</p>
<p>Full 615 thirty thousand mark 616 s of English coin.</p>
<p>Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal 617 ,</p>
<p>Command thy son and daughter to join hands.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP It likes 618 us well, young princes: close 619 your
hands.</p>
<p>AUSTRIA And your lips too, for I am well assured 620</p>
<p>That I did so when I was first assured 621 .</p>
<p>Lewis and Blanche join hands and kiss</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,</p>
<p>Let in that amity which you have made,</p>
<p>For at Saint Mary’s chapel presently 622</p>
<p>The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.</p>
<p>Is not the lady Constance in this troop?</p>
<p>I know she is not, for this match made up 623</p>
<p>Her presence would have interrupted much.</p>
<p>Where is she and her son? Tell me, who 624 knows.</p>
<p>LEWIS She is sad and passionate 625 at your highness’ tent.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP And by my faith this league that we have made</p>
<p>Will give her sadness very little cure.—</p>
<p>Brother of England, how may we content</p>
<p>This widow lady? In her right we came,</p>
<p>Which we, God knows, have turned another way,</p>
<p>To our own vantage.</p>
<p>KING JOHN We will heal up all,</p>
<p>For we’ll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne</p>
<p>And Earl of Richmond, and this rich fair town</p>
<p>We make him lord of. Call the lady Constance:</p>
<p>Some speedy messenger bid her repair 626</p>
<p>To our solemnity 627 : I trust we shall,</p>
<p>[Exit Salisbury? ]</p>
<p>If not fill up the measure 628 of her will,</p>
<p>Yet in some measure 629 satisfy her so</p>
<p>That we shall stop her exclamation 630 .</p>
<p>Go we as well as haste will suffer 631 us</p>
<p>To this unlooked-for, unpreparèd pomp 632 .</p>
<p>Exeunt [all but the Bastard ]</p>
<p>BASTARD Mad world, mad kings, mad composition 633 !</p>
<p>John, to stop Arthur’s title in the whole 634 ,</p>
<p>Hath willingly departed 635 with a part,</p>
<p>And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,</p>
<p>Whom zeal and charity brought to the field</p>
<p>As God’s own soldier, rounded 636 in the ear</p>
<p>With 637 that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,</p>
<p>That broker 638 that still breaks 639 the pate 640 of faith 641 ,</p>
<p>That daily break-vow, he that wins 642 of all,</p>
<p>Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,</p>
<p>Who 643 having no external thing 644 to lose</p>
<p>But the word ‘maid’ 645 , cheats the poor maid of that:</p>
<p>That smooth-faced 646 gentleman, tickling 647 commodity 648 ,</p>
<p>Commodity, the bias 649 of the world,</p>
<p>The world who of itself is peisèd 650 well,</p>
<p>Made to run even 651 upon even ground,</p>
<p>Till this advantage, this vile-drawing 652 bias,</p>
<p>This sway 653 of motion, this commodity,</p>
<p>Makes it take head from 654 all indifferency 655 ,</p>
<p>From all direction, purpose, course, intent:</p>
<p>And this same bias, this commodity,</p>
<p>This bawd 656 , this broker, this all-changing 657 word,</p>
<p>Clapped on 658 the outward eye 659 of fickle France,</p>
<p>Hath drawn him from his own determined 660 aid 661 ,</p>
<p>From a resolved 662 and honourable war,</p>
<p>To a most base 663 and vile-concluded peace.</p>
<p>And why rail I on 664 this commodity?</p>
<p>But for 665 because he hath not wooed me yet:</p>
<p>Not that I have the power to clutch 666 my hand,</p>
<p>When his fair angels 667 would salute 668 my palm;</p>
<p>But for 669 my hand, as unattempted 670 yet,</p>
<p>Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.</p>
<p>Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail,</p>
<p>And say there is no sin but to be rich:</p>
<p>And being rich, my virtue then shall be</p>
<p>To say there is no vice but beggary:</p>
<p>Since kings break faith upon 671 commodity,</p>
<p>Gain be my lord, for I will worship thee.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
