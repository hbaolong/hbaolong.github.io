8</h4>
<p>Enter Desdemona, Emilia and Clown</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Do you know, sirrah 1191 , where Lieutenant Cassio lies
1192 ?</p>
<p>CLOWN I dare not say he lies anywhere.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Why, man?</p>
<p>CLOWN He’s a soldier, and for me to say a soldier lies, ’tis stabbing
1193 .</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Go to: where lodges he?</p>
<p>CLOWN To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Can anything be made of this?</p>
<p>CLOWN I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and
say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat 1194
.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Can you inquire him out, and be edified 1195 by report?</p>
<p>CLOWN I will catechize 1196 the world for him, that is, make
questions, and by them answer.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have moved 1197
my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well.</p>
<p>CLOWN To do this is within the compass of man’s wit, and therefore I
will attempt the doing it.</p>
<p>Exit Clown</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Where should I lose the handkerchief, Emilia?</p>
<p>EMILIA I know not, madam.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse</p>
<p>Full of crusadoes 1198 : and but 1199 my noble Moor</p>
<p>Is true of mind and made of no such baseness</p>
<p>As jealous creatures are, it were enough</p>
<p>To put him to ill thinking.</p>
<p>EMILIA Is he not jealous?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Who, he? I think the sun where he was born</p>
<p>Drew 1200 all such humours 1201 from him.</p>
<p>EMILIA Look where he comes.</p>
<p>Enter Othello</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I will not leave him now till Cassio</p>
<p>Be called to him.— How is’t with you, my lord?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Well, my good lady.— O, hardness to dissemble 1202 !—</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>How do you, Desdemona?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Well, my good lord.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA It hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.</p>
<p>OTHELLO This argues fruitfulness 1203 and liberal 1204 heart:</p>
<p>Partially aside?</p>
<p>Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires</p>
<p>A sequester 1205 from liberty, fasting and prayer,</p>
<p>Much castigation 1206 , exercise 1207 devout,</p>
<p>For here’s a young and sweating devil here</p>
<p>That commonly rebels. ’Tis a good hand,</p>
<p>A frank 1208 one.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA You may, indeed, say so,</p>
<p>For’twas that hand that gave away my heart.</p>
<p>OTHELLO A liberal hand: the hearts 1209 of old gave hands,</p>
<p>But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.</p>
<p>OTHELLO What promise, chuck 1210 ?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.</p>
<p>OTHELLO I have a salt and sorry rheum 1211 offends me:</p>
<p>Lend me thy handkerchief.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Here, my lord.</p>
<p>Offers him a handkerchief</p>
<p>OTHELLO That which I gave you.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I have it not about me.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Not?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA No, indeed, my lord.</p>
<p>OTHELLO That’s a fault. That handkerchief</p>
<p>Did an Egyptian to my mother give:</p>
<p>She was a charmer, and could almost read</p>
<p>The thoughts of people: she told her, while she kept it,</p>
<p>’Twould make her amiable 1212 and subdue my father</p>
<p>Entirely to her love, but if she lost it</p>
<p>Or made a gift of it, my father’s eye</p>
<p>Should hold her loathèd and his spirits should hunt</p>
<p>After new fancies 1213 : she, dying, gave it me,</p>
<p>And bid me, when my fate would have me wived,</p>
<p>To give it her 1214 : I did so; and take heed 1215 on’t,</p>
<p>Make it a darling like your precious eye:</p>
<p>To lose’t or give’t away were such perdition</p>
<p>As nothing else could match.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Is’t possible?</p>
<p>OTHELLO ’Tis true. There’s magic in the web 1216 of it:</p>
<p>A sibyl 1217 , that had numbered in the world</p>
<p>The sun to course two hundred compasses 1218 ,</p>
<p>In her prophetic fury 1219 sewed the work:</p>
<p>The worms were hallowed 1220 that did breed the silk,</p>
<p>And it was dyed in mummy 1221 which the skilful</p>
<p>Conserved of 1222 maidens’ hearts.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Indeed? Is’t true?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Most veritable: therefore look to’t well.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Then would to heaven that I had never seen’t!</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ha? Wherefore?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Why do you speak so startingly and rash 1223 ?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Is’t lost? Is’t gone? Speak, is’t out o’th’way 1224 ?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Bless us!</p>
<p>OTHELLO Say you?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA It is not lost, but what an if 1225 it were?</p>
<p>OTHELLO How 1226 ?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I say it is not lost.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Fetch’t, let me see’t.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Why, so I can, but I will not now.</p>
<p>This is a trick to put me from my suit:</p>
<p>Pray you let Cassio be received again.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives 1227 .</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Come, come,</p>
<p>You’ll never meet a more sufficient 1228 man.</p>
<p>OTHELLO The handkerchief.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA A man that all his time</p>
<p>Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,</p>
<p>Shared dangers with you—</p>
<p>OTHELLO The handkerchief.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA In sooth 1229 , you are to blame.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Away!</p>
<p>Exit Othello</p>
<p>EMILIA Is not this man jealous?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I ne’er saw this before.</p>
<p>Sure, there’s some wonder 1230 in this handkerchief:</p>
<p>I am most unhappy 1231 in the loss of it.</p>
<p>EMILIA ’Tis not a year or two shows us a man:</p>
<p>They are all but stomachs, and we all but food:</p>
<p>They eat us hungerly 1232 , and when they are full</p>
<p>They belch 1233 us.</p>
<p>Enter Iago and Cassio</p>
<p>Look you, Cassio and my husband.</p>
<p>IAGO There is no other way: ’tis she must do’t.</p>
<p>And, lo, the happiness 1234 ! Go and importune her.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA How now, good Cassio, what’s the news with you?</p>
<p>CASSIO Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you</p>
<p>That by your virtuous 1235 means I may again</p>
<p>Exist, and be a member of his love</p>
<p>Whom I with all the office 1236 of my heart</p>
<p>Entirely honour. I would not be delayed.</p>
<p>If my offence be of such mortal 1237 kind</p>
<p>That nor 1238 my service past, nor present sorrows,</p>
<p>Nor purposed merit in futurity 1239 ,</p>
<p>Can ransom me into his love again,</p>
<p>But 1240 to know so must be my benefit 1241 :</p>
<p>So shall I clothe me in a forced content,</p>
<p>And shut myself up in 1242 some other course,</p>
<p>To fortune’s alms 1243 .</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,</p>
<p>My advocation 1244 is not now in tune;</p>
<p>My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,</p>
<p>Were he in favou 1245 r as in humour 1246 altered.</p>
<p>So help me every spirit sanctified</p>
<p>As I have spoken for you all my best</p>
<p>And stood within the blank 1247 of his displeasure</p>
<p>For my free speech! You must awhile be patient:</p>
<p>What I can do I will, and more I will</p>
<p>Than for myself I dare: let that suffice 1248 you.</p>
<p>IAGO Is my lord angry?</p>
<p>EMILIA He went hence but now,</p>
<p>And certainly in strange unquietness.</p>
<p>IAGO Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon</p>
<p>When it hath blown his ranks 1249 into the air,</p>
<p>And like the devil from his very arm</p>
<p>Puffed his own brother 1250 : and is he angry?</p>
<p>Something of moment 1251 then. I will go meet him:</p>
<p>There’s matter in’t indeed, if he be angry.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I prithee do so. Something, sure, of state 1252 ,</p>
<p>Either from Venice, or some unhatched practice 1253</p>
<p>Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,</p>
<p>Hath puddled 1254 his clear spirit: and in such cases</p>
<p>Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things,</p>
<p>Though great ones are their object. ’Tis even so,</p>
<p>For let our finger ache, and it indues 1255</p>
<p>Our other healthful members 1256 even to a sense</p>
<p>Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,</p>
<p>Nor of them look for such observancy</p>
<p>As fits the bridal 1257 . Beshrew 1258 me much, Emilia,</p>
<p>I was — unhandsome 1259 warrior as I am —</p>
<p>Arraigning 1260 his unkindness with my soul,</p>
<p>But now I find I had suborned the witness 1261 ,</p>
<p>And he’s indicted falsely.</p>
<p>EMILIA Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,</p>
<p>And no conception nor no jealous toy 1262</p>
<p>Concerning you.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Alas the day! I never gave him cause.</p>
<p>EMILIA But jealous souls will not be answered so;</p>
<p>They are not ever jealous for the cause,</p>
<p>But jealous for they’re jealous: it is a monster</p>
<p>Begot upon 1263 itself, born on itself.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Heaven keep the monster from Othello’s mind!</p>
<p>EMILIA Lady, amen.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I will go seek him.— Cassio, walk hereabout:</p>
<p>If I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit</p>
<p>And seek to effect it to my uttermost.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Desdemona and Emilia ]</p>
<p>CASSIO I humbly thank your ladyship.</p>
<p>Enter Bianca</p>
<p>BIANCA Save 1264 you, friend 1265 Cassio!</p>
<p>CASSIO What make you 1266 from home?</p>
<p>How is’t with you, my most fair Bianca?</p>
<p>Indeed, sweet love, I was coming to your house.</p>
<p>BIANCA And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.</p>
<p>What, keep a week away? Seven days and nights?</p>
<p>Eight score eight 1267 hours? And lovers’ absent hours</p>
<p>More tedious than the dial 1268 eight score 1269 times?</p>
<p>O weary reck’ning 1270 !</p>
<p>CASSIO Pardon me, Bianca:</p>
<p>I have this while with leaden thoughts been pressed:</p>
<p>But I shall, in a more continuate 1271 time,</p>
<p>Strike off this score 1272 of absence. Sweet Bianca,</p>
<p>Gives her Desdemona’s handkerchief</p>
<p>Take me this work out 1273 .</p>
<p>BIANCA O Cassio, whence came this?</p>
<p>This is some token from a newer friend 1274 :</p>
<p>To the felt absence now I feel a cause 1275 .</p>
<p>Is’t come to this? Well, well.</p>
<p>CASSIO Go to, woman!</p>
<p>Throw your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth,</p>
<p>From whence you have them. You are jealous now</p>
<p>That this is from some mistress, some remembrance;</p>
<p>No, in good troth, Bianca.</p>
<p>BIANCA Why, whose is it?</p>
<p>CASSIO I know not, neither: I found it in my chamber.</p>
<p>I like the work well. Ere it be demanded 1276 —</p>
<p>As like enough it will — I would have it copied:</p>
<p>Take it, and do’t, and leave me for this time.</p>
<p>BIANCA Leave you? Wherefore?</p>
<p>CASSIO I do attend here on the general,</p>
<p>And think it no addition, nor my wish,</p>
<p>To have him see me womaned 1277 .</p>
<p>BIANCA Why, I pray you?</p>
<p>CASSIO Not that I love you not.</p>
<p>BIANCA But that you do not love me.</p>
<p>I pray you bring 1278 me on the way a little,</p>
<p>And say if I shall see you soon at night 1279 .</p>
<p>CASSIO ’Tis but a little way that I can bring you,</p>
<p>For I attend here: but I’ll see you soon.</p>
<p>BIANCA ’Tis very good: I must be circumstanced 1280 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
