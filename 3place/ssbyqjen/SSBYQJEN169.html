<h4 id="scene-3-254-running-scene-3">Scene 3 254 / running scene 3</h4>
<p>Enter Bassanio with Shylock 255 the Jew</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Three thousand ducats 256 , well.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Ay, sir, for three months.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK For three months, well.</p>
<p>BASSANIO For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound 257
.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Antonio shall become bound, well.</p>
<p>BASSANIO May you stead 258 me? Will you pleasure 259 me? Shall I know
your answer?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Your answer to that.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Antonio is a good man.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Have you heard any imputation 260 to the contrary?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Ho, no, no, no, no! My meaning in saying he is a good man is
to have you understand me that he is sufficient 261 . Yet his means are
in supposition 262 : he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis 263 , another
to the Indies 264 , I understand moreover, upon the Rialto 265 , he hath
a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath
squandered 266 abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men. There
be landrats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves — I mean
pirates 267 — and then there is the peril of waters, winds and rocks.
The man is, notwithstanding 268 , sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I
think I may take his bond.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Be assured 269 you may.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will
bethink me 270 . May I speak with Antonio?</p>
<p>BASSANIO If it please you to dine with us.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation 271 which your
prophet the Nazarite 272 conjured the devil into. I will buy with you,
sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following 273 , but
I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What news on
the Rialto? Who is he comes here?</p>
<p>Enter Antonio</p>
<p>BASSANIO This is Signior Antonio.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK How like a fawning publican 274 he looks!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>I hate him for he is a Christian,</p>
<p>But more, for that in low simplicity 275</p>
<p>He lends out money gratis 276 and brings down</p>
<p>The rate of usance 277 here with us in Venice.</p>
<p>If I can catch him once upon the hip 278 ,</p>
<p>I will feed fat 279 the ancient grudge I bear him.</p>
<p>He hates our sacred nation 280 , and he rails 281 —</p>
<p>Even there where merchants most do congregate 282 —</p>
<p>On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift 283 ,</p>
<p>Which he calls interest. Cursèd be my tribe 284 ,</p>
<p>If I forgive him!</p>
<p>BASSANIO Shylock, do you hear?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I am debating of my present store 285 ,</p>
<p>And by the near guess of my memory,</p>
<p>I cannot instantly raise up the gross 286</p>
<p>Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?</p>
<p>Tubal 287 , a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,</p>
<p>Will furnish 288 me; but soft 289 ! How many months</p>
<p>Do you desire?— Rest you fair 290 , good signior.</p>
<p>To Antonio</p>
<p>Your worship was the last man in our mouths 291 .</p>
<p>ANTONIO Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow</p>
<p>By taking nor by giving of excess 292 ,</p>
<p>Yet to supply the ripe wants 293 of my friend,</p>
<p>I’ll break a custom.— Is he yet possessed 294</p>
<p>To Bassanio</p>
<p>How much ye would 295 ?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.</p>
<p>ANTONIO And for three months.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I had forgot — three months — you told me so.</p>
<p>Well then, your bond 296 . And let me see, but hear you,</p>
<p>Methoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow</p>
<p>Upon advantage 297 .</p>
<p>ANTONIO I do never use 298 it.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban’s sheep 299 —</p>
<p>This Jacob from 300 our holy Abram 301 was,</p>
<p>As his wise mother wrought 302 in his behalf,</p>
<p>The third possessor 303 ; ay, he was the third—</p>
<p>ANTONIO And what of him? Did he take interest?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK No, not take interest, not, as you would say,</p>
<p>Directly interest. Mark 304 what Jacob did:</p>
<p>When Laban and himself were compromised 305</p>
<p>That all the eanlings 306 which were streaked and pied 307</p>
<p>Should fall as 308 Jacob’s hire 309 , the ewes, being rank 310 ,</p>
<p>In end of autumn turnèd to the rams,</p>
<p>And, when the work of generation 311 was</p>
<p>Between these woolly breeders in the act,</p>
<p>The skilful shepherd peeled me certain wands 312 ,</p>
<p>And in the doing of the deed of kind 313 ,</p>
<p>He stuck them up before the fulsome 314 ewes 315 ,</p>
<p>Who then conceiving, did in eaning 316 time</p>
<p>Fall 317 parti-coloured lambs, and those were Jacob’s.</p>
<p>This was a way to thrive 318 , and he was blest:</p>
<p>And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.</p>
<p>ANTONIO This was a venture 319 , sir, that Jacob served 320 for,</p>
<p>A thing not in his power to bring to pass,</p>
<p>But swayed and fashioned 321 by the hand of heaven.</p>
<p>Was this inserted 322 to make interest good 323 ?</p>
<p>Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK I cannot tell, I make it breed as fast.</p>
<p>But note me, signior—</p>
<p>ANTONIO Mark you this, Bassanio,</p>
<p>The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.</p>
<p>An evil soul producing holy witness</p>
<p>Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,</p>
<p>A goodly 324 apple rotten at the heart.</p>
<p>O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Three thousand ducats, ’tis a good round sum.</p>
<p>Three months from twelve, then let me see, the rate—</p>
<p>ANTONIO Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding 325 to you?</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Signior Antonio, many a time and oft</p>
<p>In the Rialto you have rated 326 me</p>
<p>About my moneys and my usances.</p>
<p>Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,</p>
<p>For sufferance 327 is the badge of all our tribe.</p>
<p>You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,</p>
<p>And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine 328 ,</p>
<p>And all for use 329 of that which is mine own.</p>
<p>Well then, it now appears you need my help.</p>
<p>Go to 330 , then. You come to me and you say</p>
<p>‘Shylock, we would have moneys’ — you say so,</p>
<p>You that did void 331 your rheum 332 upon my beard,</p>
<p>And foot 333 me as you spurn 334 a stranger cur 335</p>
<p>Over your threshold. Moneys is your suit 336 .</p>
<p>What should I say to you? Should I not say,</p>
<p>’Hath a dog money? Is it possible</p>
<p>A cur should lend three thousand ducats?’ Or</p>
<p>Shall I bend low and in a bondman’s key 337 ,</p>
<p>With bated 338 breath and whisp’ring humbleness,</p>
<p>Say this: ’Fair sir, you spat on me on Wednesday last;</p>
<p>You spurned me such a day; another time</p>
<p>You called me dog, and for these courtesies</p>
<p>I’ll lend you thus much moneys’?</p>
<p>ANTONIO I am as like 339 to call thee so again,</p>
<p>To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.</p>
<p>If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not</p>
<p>As to thy friends, for when did friendship take</p>
<p>A breed of barren 340 metal 341 of 342 his friend?</p>
<p>But lend it rather to thine enemy,</p>
<p>Who, if he break 343 , thou mayst with better 344 face</p>
<p>Exact the penalties.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Why, look you how you storm!</p>
<p>I would be friends with you and have your love,</p>
<p>Forget the shames that you have stained me with,</p>
<p>Supply your present wants and take no doit 345</p>
<p>Of usance for my moneys, and you’ll not hear me:</p>
<p>This is kind 346 I offer.</p>
<p>BASSANIO This were 347 kindness.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK This kindness will I show:</p>
<p>Go with me to a notary 348 , seal me there</p>
<p>Your single 349 bond, and in a merry sport</p>
<p>If you repay me not on such a day,</p>
<p>In such a place, such sum or sums as are</p>
<p>Expressed in the condition 350 , let the forfeit</p>
<p>Be nominated for 351 an equal 352 pound</p>
<p>Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken</p>
<p>In what part of your body it pleaseth me.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Content, in faith, I’ll seal to such a bond</p>
<p>And say there is much kindness in the Jew.</p>
<p>BASSANIO You shall not seal to such a bond for me.</p>
<p>I’ll rather dwell 353 in my necessity 354 .</p>
<p>ANTONIO Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it.</p>
<p>Within these two months — that’s a month before</p>
<p>This bond expires — I do expect return</p>
<p>Of thrice three times the value of this bond.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK O father Abram, what these Christians are,</p>
<p>Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect 355</p>
<p>The thoughts of others! Pray you tell me this:</p>
<p>If he should break his day 356 , what should I gain</p>
<p>By the exaction 357 of the forfeiture?</p>
<p>A pound of man’s flesh taken from a man</p>
<p>Is not so estimable 358 , profitable neither,</p>
<p>As flesh of muttons, beefs or goats. I say</p>
<p>To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:</p>
<p>If he will take it, so 359 , if not, adieu.</p>
<p>And for my love, I pray you wrong me not.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK Then meet me forthwith 360 at the notary’s,</p>
<p>Give him direction 361 for this merry bond,</p>
<p>And I will go and purse 362 the ducats straight,</p>
<p>See 363 to my house, left in the fearful 364 guard</p>
<p>Of an unthrifty 365 knave 366 , and presently 367</p>
<p>I’ll be with you.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>ANTONIO Hie 368 thee, gentle 369 Jew.</p>
<p>This Hebrew will turn Christian, he grows kind 370 .</p>
<p>BASSANIO I like not fair terms and a villain’s mind.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Come on, in this there can be no dismay.</p>
<p>My ships come home a month before the day.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
