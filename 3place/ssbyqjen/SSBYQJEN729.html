16</h4>
<p>Enter two Grooms</p>
<p>FIRST GROOM More rushes 1762 , more rushes.</p>
<p>SECOND GROOM The trumpets have sounded twice.</p>
<p>FIRST GROOM It will be two of the clock ere they come from the
coronation.</p>
<p>Exeunt Grooms</p>
<p>Enter Falstaff, Shallow, Pistol, Bardolph and Page</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow. I will make the
king do you grace. I will leer upon 1763 him as he comes by, and do but
mark the countenance 1764 that he will give me.</p>
<p>PISTOL Bless thy lungs, good knight.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Come here, Pistol, stand behind me.— O, if I had had time to
have made new liveries 1765 , I would have bestowed 1766 the thousand
pound I borrowed of you. But it is no matter, this poor show doth
better: this doth infer 1767 the zeal I had to see him.</p>
<p>SHALLOW It doth so.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF It shows my earnestness in affection—</p>
<p>PISTOL It doth so.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My devotion—</p>
<p>PISTOL It doth, it doth, it doth.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF As it were, to ride day and night, and not to deliberate,
not to remember, not to have patience to shift me 1768 —</p>
<p>SHALLOW It is most certain.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF But to stand stained with travel, and sweating with desire
to see him, thinking of nothing else, putting all affairs in oblivion,
as if there were nothing else to be done but to see him.</p>
<p>PISTOL ’Tis semper idem 1769 , for obsque hoc nihil est . ’Tis all in
every part 1770 .</p>
<p>SHALLOW ’Tis so, indeed.</p>
<p>PISTOL My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver 1771 ,</p>
<p>And make thee rage.</p>
<p>Thy Doll, and Helen 1772 of thy noble thoughts,</p>
<p>Is in base durance 1773 and contagious prison,</p>
<p>Haled 1774 thither</p>
<p>By most mechanical 1775 and dirty hand.</p>
<p>Rouse up revenge from ebon 1776 den with fell 1777</p>
<p>Alecto 1778 ’s snake,</p>
<p>For Doll is in 1779 . Pistol speaks naught but troth.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I will deliver her.</p>
<p>PISTOL There roared the sea, and trumpet-clangour sounds.</p>
<p>The trumpets sound. Enter King Henry V, [with his ] brothers [Prince
John, Clarence, Gloucester ], Lord Chief Justice [and others ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Save thy grace, King Hal, my royal Hal!</p>
<p>PISTOL The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp 1780 of
fame!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Save thee, my sweet boy!</p>
<p>KING HENRY V My Lord Chief Justice, speak to that vain 1781 man.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Have you your wits? Know you what ’tis you
speak?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My king, my Jove 1782 ! I speak to thee, my heart 1783 !</p>
<p>KING HENRY V I know thee not, old man. Fall to thy prayers.</p>
<p>How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!</p>
<p>I have long dreamed of such a kind of man,</p>
<p>So surfeit-swelled 1784 , so old and so profane.</p>
<p>But being awake, I do despise my dream.</p>
<p>Make less thy body hence 1785 , and more thy grace,</p>
<p>Leave gormandizing 1786 ; know the grave doth gape</p>
<p>For thee thrice wider than for other men.</p>
<p>Reply not to me with a fool-born jest.</p>
<p>Presume not that I am the thing I was,</p>
<p>For heaven doth know — so shall the world perceive —</p>
<p>That I have turned away my former self,</p>
<p>So will I those that kept me company.</p>
<p>When thou dost hear I am as I have been,</p>
<p>Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,</p>
<p>The tutor and the feeder of my riots 1787 :</p>
<p>Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,</p>
<p>As I have done the rest of my misleaders,</p>
<p>Not to come near our 1788 person by ten mile.</p>
<p>For competence of life 1789 I will allow you,</p>
<p>That lack of means enforce you not to evil 1790 .</p>
<p>And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,</p>
<p>We will, according to your strength and qualities,</p>
<p>Give you advancement 1791 .— Be it your charge 1792 , my lord,</p>
<p>To Chief Justice</p>
<p>To see performed the tenor 1793 of our word.— Set on.</p>
<p>Exeunt King [and his train ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Aye, marry, Sir John, which I beseech you to let me have home
with me.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you grieve at
this: I shall be sent for in private to him. Look you, he must seem thus
to the world. Fear not your advancement. I will be the man yet that
shall make you great.</p>
<p>SHALLOW I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give me your
doublet 1794 and stuff me out with straw. I beseech you, good Sir John,
let me have five hundred of my thousand.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Sir, I will be as good as my word. This that you heard was
but a colour 1795 .</p>
<p>SHALLOW A colour 1796 I fear that you will die 1797 in, Sir John.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Fear no colours 1798 . Go with me to dinner.— Come,
Lieutenant Pistol. Come, Bardolph. I shall be sent for soon at night
1799 .</p>
<p>[Enter Prince John, the Lord Chief Justice and Officers ]</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet 1800
.</p>
<p>Take all his company along with him.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My lord, my lord—</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE I cannot now speak. I will hear you soon. Take
them away.</p>
<p>PISTOL Si fortuna me tormento, spero me contento 1801 .</p>
<p>Exeunt all but Lancaster [Prince John ] and Chief Justice</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN I like this fair proceeding 1802 of the king’s.</p>
<p>He hath intent 1803 his wonted 1804 followers</p>
<p>Shall all be very well provided for,</p>
<p>But all are banished till their conversations 1805</p>
<p>Appear more wise and modest to the world.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE And so they are.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN The king hath called his parliament, my lord.</p>
<p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE He hath.</p>
<p>PRINCE JOHN I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,</p>
<p>We bear our civil swords 1806 and native fire</p>
<p>As far as France. I heard a bird so sing,</p>
<p>Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the king.</p>
<p>Come, will you hence?</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>[Enter the Epilogue ]</p>
<p>First my fear, then my curtsy 1807 , last my speech. My fear is your
1808 displeasure: my curtsy, my duty: and my speech, to beg your
pardons. If you look for a good speech now, you undo me, for what I have
to say is of mine own making, and what indeed I should say will, I doubt
1809 , prove mine own marring 1810 . But to the purpose, and so to the
venture 1811 . Be it known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here
in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your patience for it and to
promise you a better. I did mean indeed to pay you with this, which, if
like an ill venture 1812 it come unluckily home, I break 1813 , and you,
my gentle creditors 1814 , lose. Here I promised you I would be and here
I commit my body to your mercies: bate me 1815 some and I will pay you
some and, as most debtors do, promise you infinitely. If my tongue
cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you command me to use my legs? And
yet that were but light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a good
conscience will make any possible satisfaction, and so will I. All the
gentlewomen here have forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the
gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which was never seen before
in such an assembly. One word more, I beseech you: if you be not too
much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will continue the story,
with Sir John in it 1816 , and make you merry with fair Katherine of
France, where, for anything I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat 1817 ,
unless already he be killed with your hard 1818 opinions. For Oldcastle
died a martyr 1819 , and this is not the man. My tongue is weary, when
my legs are too, I will bid you goodnight, and so kneel down before you;
but, indeed, to pray for the queen.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>Quarto passages that do not appear in the Folio</p>
<p>Following 1.2.here :</p>
<p>but it was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if they have a
good thing, to make it too common. If ye will needs say I am an old man,
you should give me rest. I would to God my name were not so terrible to
the enemy as it is: I were better to be eaten to death with a rust than
to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion.</p>
<p>Following 2.2.here :</p>
<p>and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen
shall inherit his kingdom: but the midwives say the children are not in
the fault; whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are mightily
strengthened.</p>
<p>Following 2.4.here :</p>
<p>Dispatch: the room where they supped is too hot; they’ll come in
straight.</p>
<p>Following 2.4.here :</p>
<p>DOLL TEARSHEET Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself!</p>
<p>Following 2.4.here :</p>
<p>FALSTAFF No more, Pistol; I would not have you discharge yourself of
our company, Pistol.</p>
<p>After ‘divers liquors!’ in 3.1.here :</p>
<p>O, if this were seen,</p>
<p>The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,</p>
<p>What perils past, what crosses to ensue,</p>
<p>Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.</p>

so I kneele downe before you; but indeed, to pray for the Queene. (2)
from If my tongue cannot to such as assemblie. (3) from One word more to
wil bid you, good night. I.e. F moves prayer for the Queen to the end.
The confusion may be caused by the conflation of two distinct epilogues,
perhaps one for public and one for court performance</p>
