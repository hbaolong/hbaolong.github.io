<h4 id="scene-2-546-running-scene-5">Scene 2 546 ／ running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter Prince Henry and Poins</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Trust me, I am exceeding weary.</p>
<p>POINS Is it come to that? I had thought weariness durst not have
attached 547 one of so high blood.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY It doth me, though it discolours the complexion of my
greatness 548 to acknowledge it. Doth it not show vilely 549 in me to
desire small beer 550 ?</p>
<p>POINS Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied 551 as to
remember so weak a composition 552 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Belike 553 then my appetite was not princely got 554 ,
for, in troth, I do now remember the poor creature, small beer. But
indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my
greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name 555 ? Or to
know thy face tomorrow? Or to take note how many pair of silk stockings
thou hast — videlicet 556 these — and those that were thy peach-coloured
ones—or to bear 557 the inventory of thy shirts, as one for superfluity
558 , and one other for use? But that the tennis-court-keeper knows
better than I, for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou kept’st
not racket 559 there, as thou hast not done a great while, because the
rest of thy Low Countries 560 have made a shift to eat up thy Holland
561 .</p>
<p>POINS How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard, you should
talk so idly! Tell me, how many good young princes would do so, their
fathers lying so sick as yours is?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?</p>
<p>POINS Yes, and let it be an excellent good thing.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than
thine.</p>
<p>POINS Go to 562 . I stand the push 563 of your one thing that you’ll
tell.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Why, I tell thee it is not meet 564 that I should be sad
now my father is sick — albeit 565 I could tell to thee, as to one it
pleases me, for fault 566 of a better, to call my friend, I could be
sad, and sad indeed too.</p>
<p>POINS Very hardly 567 upon such a subject.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Thou think’st me as far in the devil’s book as thou and
Falstaff for obduracy and persistency. Let the end try 568 the man. But
I tell thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick: and
keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all
ostentation 569 of sorrow.</p>
<p>POINS The reason?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?</p>
<p>POINS I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY It would be every man’s thought, and thou art a blessed
fellow to think as every man thinks: never a 570 man’s thought in the
world keeps the roadway 571 better than thine: every man would think me
an hypocrite indeed. And what accites 572 your most worshipful thought
to think so?</p>
<p>POINS Why, because you have been so lewd 573 and so much engraffed
574 to Falstaff.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY And to thee.</p>
<p>POINS Nay, I am well spoken of. I can hear it with mine own ears: the
worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother 575 and that
I am a proper fellow of my hands 576 . And those two things, I confess,
I cannot help. Look, look, here comes Bardolph.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY And the boy that I gave Falstaff. He had him from me
Christian, and see if the fat villain have not transformed him ape 577
.</p>
<p>Enter Bardolph [and Falstaff’s Page ]</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Save 578 your grace 579 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY And yours, most noble Bardolph.</p>
<p>POINS Come, you pernicious ass, you bashful fool, must you be
blushing 580 ? Wherefore blush you now? What a maidenly man-at-arms are
you become! Is it such a matter to get a pottle-pot’s maidenhead 581 582
?</p>
<p>To Bardolph</p>
<p>PAGE He called me even now, my lord, through a red lattice 583 , and
I could discern no part of his face from the window. At last I spied his
eyes, and methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife’s new
petticoat 584 and peeped through.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Hath not the boy profited 585 ?</p>
<p>To Poins</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!</p>
<p>PAGE Away, you rascally Althaea’s dream 586 , away!</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Instruct us, boy. What dream, boy?</p>
<p>PAGE Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamed she was delivered of a
fire-brand 587 , and therefore I call him her dream.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY A crown’s worth of good interpretation.— There it is,
boy.</p>
<p>Gives Page money</p>
<p>POINS O, that this good blossom 588 could be kept from cankers 589 !
— Well, there is sixpence 590 to preserve thee.</p>
<p>Gives Page money</p>
<p>BARDOLPH If you do not make him be hanged among you 591 , the gallows
shall be wronged.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY And how doth thy master, Bardolph?</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Well, my good lord. He heard of your grace’s coming to town.
There’s a letter for you.</p>
<p>Gives a letter</p>
<p>POINS Delivered with good respect 592 . And how doth the martlemas
593 , your master?</p>
<p>BARDOLPH In bodily health, sir.</p>
<p>POINS Marry, the immortal part needs a physician, but that moves not
him: though that be sick, it dies not.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I do allow this wen 594 to be as familiar with me as my
dog, and he holds his place 595 , for look you he writes.</p>
<p>POINS</p>
<p>(Letter)</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>‘John Falstaff, knight.’ — Every man must know that, as oft as he
hath occasion to name himself 596 , even like 597 those that are kin to
the king, for they never prick their finger but they say, ‘There is some
of the king’s blood spilt.’ ‘How comes that?’ says he that takes upon
him not to conceive 598 . The answer is as ready as a borrower’s cap 599
, ‘I am the king’s poor cousin, sir.’</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Nay, they will be 600 kin to us, but they will fetch it
from Japhet 601 . But to the letter: ‘Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the
son of the king, nearest his father, Harry Prince of Wales,
greeting.’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>POINS Why, this is a certificate 602 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Peace! ‘I will imitate the honourable Romans in
brevity.’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>POINS Sure he means brevity in breath, short-winded. ‘I commend me to
thee 603 , I commend thee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with
Poins, for he misuses thy favours so much, that he swears thou art to
marry his sister Nell. Repent at idle times 604 as thou mayst 605 , and
so farewell. Thine, by yea and no 606 , which is as much as to say, as
thou usest him, Jack Falstaff with my familiars 607 , John with my
brothers and sister, and Sir John with all Europe.’ My lord, I will
steep 608 this letter in sack 609 and make him eat it.</p>
<p>Takes the letter</p>
<p>and reads</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY That’s to make him eat twenty 610 of his words. But do
you use 611 me thus, Ned? Must I marry your sister?</p>
<p>POINS May the wench have no worse fortune! But I never said so.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Well, thus we play the fools with the time 612 , and the
spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.— Is your master here
in London?</p>
<p>To Bardoloph</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Where sups he? Doth the old boar feed in the old frank
613 ?</p>
<p>BARDOLPH At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What company?</p>
<p>PAGE Ephesians, my lord, of the old church 614 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Sup any women with him?</p>
<p>PAGE None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and Mistress Doll
Tearsheet.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY What pagan 615 may that be?</p>
<p>PAGE A proper 616 gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my
master’s.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bull
617 .— Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?</p>
<p>To Poins</p>
<p>POINS I am your shadow, my lord: I’ll follow you.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your master
that I am yet in town. There’s for your silence.</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>BARDOLPH I have no tongue, sir.</p>
<p>PAGE And for mine, sir, I will govern it.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Fare ye well. Go.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Bardolph and Page ]</p>
<p>This Doll Tearsheet should be some road 618 .</p>
<p>POINS I warrant you, as common as the way between St Albans 619 and
London 620 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY How might we see Falstaff bestow 621 himself tonight in
his true colours, and not ourselves be seen?</p>
<p>POINS Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait upon him at
his table like drawers 622 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY From a God to a bull 623 ? A heavy declension 624 ! It
was Jove’s case 625 . From a prince to a prentice 626 , a low
transformation: that shall be mine, for in everything the purpose must
weigh with 627 the folly. Follow me, Ned.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
