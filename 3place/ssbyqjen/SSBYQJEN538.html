16</h4>
<p>Enter Gloucester and Edgar</p>
<p>Edgar dressed like a peasant</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER When shall I come to th’top of that same hill 1309 ?</p>
<p>EDGAR You do climb up it now: look how we labour.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Methinks the ground is even.</p>
<p>EDGAR Horrible steep.</p>
<p>Hark, do you hear the sea?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER No, truly.</p>
<p>EDGAR Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect</p>
<p>By your eyes’ anguish.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER So may it be, indeed:</p>
<p>Methinks thy voice is altered and thou speak’st</p>
<p>In better phrase and matter 1310 than thou didst.</p>
<p>EDGAR You’re much deceived: in nothing am I changed</p>
<p>But in my garments.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Methinks you’re better spoken.</p>
<p>EDGAR Come on, sir, here’s the place: stand still. How fearful</p>
<p>And dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low!</p>
<p>The crows and choughs 1311 that wing 1312 the midway 1313 air</p>
<p>Show scarce so gross 1314 as beetles: halfway down</p>
<p>Hangs one that gathers samphire 1315 , dreadful trade!</p>
<p>Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.</p>
<p>The fishermen that walk upon the beach</p>
<p>Appear like mice, and yond 1316 tall anchoring bark 1317</p>
<p>Diminished to her cock 1318 , her cock, a buoy</p>
<p>Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge,</p>
<p>That on th’unnumbered idle pebble 1319 chafes,</p>
<p>Cannot be heard so high. I’ll look no more,</p>
<p>Lest my brain turn and the deficient 1320 sight</p>
<p>Topple 1321 down headlong.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Set me where you stand.</p>
<p>EDGAR Give me your hand: you are now within a foot</p>
<p>Of th’extreme verge: for all beneath the moon</p>
<p>Would I not leap upright 1322 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Let go my hand.</p>
<p>Here, friend’s 1323 another purse: in it a jewel</p>
<p>Gives a purse</p>
<p>Well worth a poor man’s taking: fairies and gods</p>
<p>Prosper it 1324 with thee! Go thou further off:</p>
<p>Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.</p>
<p>EDGAR Now fare ye well, good sir.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER With all my heart.</p>
<p>EDGAR Why I do trifle 1325 thus with his despair</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Is done to cure it.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER O you mighty gods!</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>This world I do renounce, and in your sights</p>
<p>Shake patiently my great affliction off:</p>
<p>If I could bear it longer, and not fall</p>
<p>To quarrel with your great opposeless 1326 wills,</p>
<p>My snuff and loathèd part of nature 1327 should</p>
<p>Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!—</p>
<p>Now, fellow, fare thee well.</p>
<p>He falls forward</p>
<p>EDGAR Gone, sir: farewell.—</p>
<p>And yet I know not how conceit 1328 may rob</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>The treasury of life, when life itself</p>
<p>Yields 1329 to the theft: had he been where he thought,</p>
<p>By this 1330 had thought been past. Alive or dead?—</p>
<p>Ho, you sir! Friend! Hear you, sir! Speak!—</p>
<p>Thus might he pass 1331 indeed: yet he revives.—</p>
<p>What 1332 are you, sir?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Away, and let me die.</p>
<p>EDGAR Hadst thou been aught 1333 but gossamer, feathers, air —</p>
<p>So many fathom down precipitating 1334 —</p>
<p>Thou’dst shivered 1335 like an egg: but thou dost breathe,</p>
<p>Hast heavy substance, bleed’st not, speak’st, art sound.</p>
<p>Ten masts at each 1336 make not the altitude</p>
<p>Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:</p>
<p>Thy life’s a miracle. Speak yet again.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER But have I fall’n or no?</p>
<p>EDGAR From the dread summit of this chalky bourn 1337 .</p>
<p>Look up a-height 1338 : the shrill-gorged 1339 lark so far</p>
<p>Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Alack, I have no eyes.</p>
<p>Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,</p>
<p>To end itself by death? ’Twas yet some comfort</p>
<p>When misery could beguile 1340 the tyrant’s rage</p>
<p>And frustrate his proud will.</p>
<p>EDGAR Give me your arm.</p>
<p>Helps him up</p>
<p>Up, so. How is’t? Feel you your legs? You stand.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Too well, too well.</p>
<p>EDGAR This is above all strangeness.</p>
<p>Upon the crown o’th’cliff what thing was that</p>
<p>Which parted from you?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER A poor unfortunate beggar.</p>
<p>EDGAR As I stood here below, methought his eyes</p>
<p>Were two full moons: he had a thousand noses,</p>
<p>Horns whelked 1341 and waved like the enragèd sea.</p>
<p>It was some fiend 1342 : therefore, thou happy father 1343 ,</p>
<p>Think that the clearest 1344 gods, who make them honours</p>
<p>Of men’s impossibilities 1345 , have preserved thee.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER I do remember now: henceforth I’ll bear</p>
<p>Affliction till it do cry out itself</p>
<p>‘Enough, enough’ and die. That thing you speak of,</p>
<p>I took it for a man: often ’twould say</p>
<p>‘The fiend, the fiend’: he led me to that place.</p>
<p>EDGAR Bear free 1346 and patient thoughts.</p>
<p>Enter Lear</p>
<p>Dressed with weeds</p>
<p>But who comes here?</p>
<p>The safer sense will ne’er accommodate</p>
<p>His master thus 1347 .</p>
<p>LEAR No, they cannot touch 1348 me for crying: I am the king
himself.</p>
<p>EDGAR O thou side-piercing sight!</p>
<p>LEAR Nature’s above art in that respect. There’s your press-money
1349 . That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper 1350 . Draw me a
clothier’s yard 1351 . Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace, this piece of
toasted cheese will do’t. There’s my gauntlet 1352 : I’ll prove it on
1353 a giant. Bring up the brown bills 1354 . O, well flown, bird 1355 !
I’th’clout 1356 , i’th’clout: hewgh 1357 ! Give the word 1358 .</p>
<p>EDGAR Sweet marjoram 1359 .</p>
<p>LEAR Pass.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER I know that voice.</p>
<p>LEAR Ha? Goneril with a white beard? They flattered me like a dog
1360 and told me I had the white hairs in my beard ere the black ones
were there 1361 . To say ‘Ay’ and ‘No’ to everything that I said ‘Ay’
and ‘No’ to was no good divinity 1362 .When the rain came to wet me 1363
once and the wind to make me chatter, when the thunder would not peace
1364 at my bidding, there I found ’em, there I smelt ’em out. Go to,
they are not men o’their words: they told me I was everything: ’tis a
lie, I am not ague-proof 1365 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER The trick 1366 of that voice I do well remember:</p>
<p>Is’t not the king?</p>
<p>LEAR Ay, every inch a king.</p>
<p>When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.</p>
<p>I pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause 1367 ?</p>
<p>Adultery?</p>
<p>Thou shalt not die: die for adultery? No.</p>
<p>The wren goes to’t 1368 and the small gilded fly</p>
<p>Does lecher 1369 in my sight. Let copulation thrive,</p>
<p>For Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to his father</p>
<p>Than were my daughters got 1370 ’tween the lawful sheets.</p>
<p>To’t, luxury 1371 , pell-mell, for I lack soldiers 1372 .</p>
<p>Behold yond simp’ring dame,</p>
<p>Whose face between her forks presages snow 1373 ,</p>
<p>That minces virtue 1374 and does shake the head 1375</p>
<p>To hear of pleasure’s name:</p>
<p>The fitchew 1376 nor the soilèd 1377 horse goes to’t</p>
<p>With a more riotous 1378 appetite. Down from the waist</p>
<p>They are centaurs 1379 , though women all above:</p>
<p>But to the girdle 1380 do the gods inherit 1381 ,</p>
<p>Beneath is all the fiends’:</p>
<p>There’s hell 1382 , there’s darkness, there is the sulphurous 1383
pit: burning, scalding, stench, consumption 1384 . Fie, fie, fie! Pah,
pah! Give me an ounce of civet 1385 , good apothecary 1386 , sweeten my
imagination: there’s money for thee.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER O, let me kiss that hand!</p>
<p>LEAR Let me wipe it first: it smells of mortality 1387 .</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER O, ruined piece of nature! This great world</p>
<p>Shall so 1388 wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?</p>
<p>LEAR I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squinny 1389 at me?
No, do thy worst, blind Cupid 1390 : I’ll not love. Read thou this
challenge 1391 , mark but the penning 1392 of it.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Were all thy letters suns, I could not see.</p>
<p>EDGAR I would not take this from report 1393 : it is,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>And my heart breaks at it.</p>
<p>LEAR Read.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER What, with the case 1394 of eyes?</p>
<p>LEAR O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money
in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case 1395 , your purse in a
light, yet you see how this world goes.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER I see it feelingly 1396 .</p>
<p>LEAR What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes with no eyes.
Look with thine ears: see how yond justice 1397 rails upon yond simple
1398 thief. Hark, in thine ear: change places, and handy-dandy 1399 ,
which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer’s dog
bark at a beggar?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Ay, sir.</p>
<p>LEAR And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the
great</p>
<p>image of authority: a dog’s obeyed in office 1400 .</p>
<p>Thou rascal beadle 1401 , hold thy bloody hand!</p>
<p>Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thy own back:</p>
<p>Thou hotly lusts to use 1402 her in that kind 1403</p>
<p>For which thou whip’st her. The usurer 1404 hangs the cozener 1405
.</p>
<p>Through tattered clothes great vices do appear:</p>
<p>Robes and furred gowns hide all. Place sins with gold 1406 ,</p>
<p>And the strong lance of justice hurtless 1407 breaks:</p>
<p>Arm it 1408 in rags, a pigmy’s straw does pierce it.</p>
<p>None does offend, none, I say, none: I’ll able ’em 1409 .</p>
<p>Take that of me, my friend, who have the power</p>
<p>To seal th’accuser’s lips. Get thee glass eyes,</p>
<p>And like a scurvy politician 1410 seem</p>
<p>To see the things thou dost not. Now, now 1411 , now, now.</p>
<p>Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.</p>
<p>EDGAR O, matter and impertinency 1412 mixed! Reason in madness!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>LEAR If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.</p>
<p>I know thee well enough: thy name is Gloucester.</p>
<p>Thou must be patient; we came crying hither 1413 .</p>
<p>Thou know’st the first time that we smell the air</p>
<p>We wail and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Alack, alack the day!</p>
<p>LEAR When we are born, we cry that we are come</p>
<p>To this great stage of fools. This a good block 1414 :</p>
<p>It were a delicate 1415 stratagem to shoe</p>
<p>A troop of horse with felt: I’ll put’t in proof 1416 ,</p>
<p>And when I have stol’n upon these son-in-laws,</p>
<p>Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!</p>
<p>Enter a Gentleman [with Attendants ]</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN O, here he is: lay hand upon him.— Sir,</p>
<p>Your most dear daughter—</p>
<p>LEAR No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even</p>
<p>The natural fool 1417 of fortune. Use me well,</p>
<p>You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons:</p>
<p>I am cut to th’brains.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN You shall have anything.</p>
<p>LEAR No seconds 1418 ? All myself?</p>
<p>Why, this would make a man a man of salt 1419</p>
<p>To use his eyes for garden water-pots,</p>
<p>I will die 1420 bravely 1421 , like a smug bridegroom. What?</p>
<p>I will be jovial 1422 . Come, come, I am a king,</p>
<p>Masters 1423 , know you that?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN You are a royal one, and we obey you.</p>
<p>LEAR Then there’s life in’t. Come, an you get it, you shall get it by
running. Sa, sa 1424 , sa, sa.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Running, Attendants follow</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,</p>
<p>Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast a daughter</p>
<p>Who redeems nature 1425 from the general curse 1426</p>
<p>Which twain 1427 have brought her to.</p>
<p>EDGAR Hail, gentle 1428 sir.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Sir, speed you 1429 : what’s your will?</p>
<p>EDGAR Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward 1430 ?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Most sure and vulgar 1431 : everyone hears that</p>
<p>Which can distinguish sound.</p>
<p>EDGAR But, by your favour 1432 ,</p>
<p>How near’s the other army?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Near and on speedy foot: the main descry</p>
<p>Stands on the hourly thought 1433 .</p>
<p>EDGAR I thank you, sir: that’s all.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Though that 1434 the queen on special cause 1435 is
here,</p>
<p>Her army is moved on.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>EDGAR I thank you, sir.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me:</p>
<p>Let not my worser spirit 1436 tempt me again</p>
<p>To die before you please!</p>
<p>EDGAR Well pray you, father.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Now, good sir, what are you?</p>
<p>EDGAR A most poor man, made tame to fortune’s blows,</p>
<p>Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows 1437 ,</p>
<p>Am pregnant to good pity 1438 . Give me your hand:</p>
<p>I’ll lead you to some biding 1439 .</p>
<p>Takes his arm</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Hearty thanks:</p>
<p>The bounty and the benison 1440 of heaven</p>
<p>To boot 1441 , and boot.</p>
<p>Enter Steward [Oswald ]</p>
<p>OSWALD A proclaimed prize 1442 ! Most happy 1443 !</p>
<p>That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh 1444</p>
<p>To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,</p>
<p>Draws</p>
<p>Briefly thyself remember 1445 : the sword is out</p>
<p>That must destroy thee.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Now let thy friendly hand</p>
<p>Put strength enough to’t.</p>
<p>Edgar interposes</p>
<p>OSWALD Wherefore, bold peasant,</p>
<p>Darest thou support a published 1446 traitor? Hence,</p>
<p>Lest that th’infection of his fortune take</p>
<p>Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.</p>
<p>EDGAR ’Chill not let go, zir, without vurther ’casion 1447 .</p>
<p>OSWALD Let go, slave, or thou diest!</p>
<p>EDGAR Good gentleman, go your gait 1448 , and let poor volk pass. An
‘chud ha’ bin zwaggered out of my life, ‘twould not ha’ bin zo long as
’tis by a vortnight 1449 . Nay, come not near th’old man: keep out, che
vor ye 1450 , or I’se 1451 try whether your costard 1452 or my ballow
1453 be the harder. ’Chill 1454 be plain with you.</p>
<p>OSWALD Out, dunghill!</p>
<p>EDGAR ’Chill pick 1455 your teeth, zir: come, no matter vor your
foins 1456 .</p>
<p>They fight</p>
<p>OSWALD Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse:</p>
<p>If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body</p>
<p>And give the letters which thou find’st about me</p>
<p>To Edmund, Earl of Gloucester: seek him out</p>
<p>Upon the English party 1457 . O, untimely death! Death!</p>
<p>He dies</p>
<p>EDGAR I know thee well: a serviceable 1458 villain,</p>
<p>As duteous to the vices of thy mistress</p>
<p>As badness would desire.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER What, is he dead?</p>
<p>EDGAR Sit you down, father: rest you.</p>
<p>Let’s see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of</p>
<p>May be my friends. He’s dead: I am only sorry</p>
<p>He had no other deathsman 1459 . Let us see.</p>
<p>Opens the letter</p>
<p>Leave 1460 , gentle wax, and manners, blame us not:</p>
<p>To know our enemies’ minds we rip their hearts:</p>
<p>Their papers is more lawful.</p>
<p>Reads the letter</p>
<p>’Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have many opportunities
to cut him off: if your will 1461 want not 1462 , time and place will be
fruitfully offered. There is nothing done 1463 if he return the
conqueror: then am I the prisoner, and his bed my jail, from the loathed
warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the place for your labour 1464
.</p>
<p>Your — wife, so I would say — affectionate servant 1465 ,
Goneril.’</p>
<p>O, undistinguished space 1466 of woman’s will 1467 !</p>
<p>A plot upon her virtuous husband’s life,</p>
<p>And the exchange my brother! Here in the sands</p>
<p>Thee I’ll rake up 1468 , the post unsanctified 1469</p>
<p>Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time 1470</p>
<p>With this ungracious 1471 paper strike 1472 the sight</p>
<p>Of the death-practised 1473 duke: for him ’tis well</p>
<p>That of thy death and business I can tell.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER The king is mad: how stiff 1474 is my vile sense,</p>
<p>That I stand up and have ingenious 1475 feeling</p>
<p>Of my huge sorrows. Better I were distract 1476 ,</p>
<p>So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs,</p>
<p>Drum afar off</p>
<p>And woes by wrong imaginations 1477 lose</p>
<p>The knowledge of themselves.</p>
<p>EDGAR Give me your hand:</p>
<p>Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum.</p>
<p>Come, father, I’ll bestow you with a friend.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
