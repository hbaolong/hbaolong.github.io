<h4 id="scene-1running-scene-8">Scene 1／running scene 8</h4>
<p>Enter Prospero, Ferdinand and Miranda</p>
<p>PROSPERO If I have too austerely 793 punished you,</p>
<p>To Ferdinand</p>
<p>Your compensation 794 makes amends, for I</p>
<p>Have given you here a third 795 of mine own life,</p>
<p>Or that for which I live: who once again</p>
<p>I tender 796 to thy hand. All thy vexations 797</p>
<p>Were but my trials of thy love, and thou</p>
<p>Hast strangely 798 stood the test: here, afore heaven,</p>
<p>I ratify 799 this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,</p>
<p>Do not smile at me that I boast her of 800 ,</p>
<p>For thou shalt 801 find she will outstrip all praise</p>
<p>And make it halt behind her.</p>
<p>FERDINAND I do believe it gainst 802 an oracle.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Then, as my guest, and thine own acquisition</p>
<p>Worthily purchased 803 , take my daughter: but</p>
<p>If thou dost break her virgin-knot before</p>
<p>All sanctimonious 804 ceremonies may</p>
<p>With full and holy rite be ministered,</p>
<p>No sweet aspersion 805 shall the heavens let fall</p>
<p>To make this contract grow; but barren hate,</p>
<p>Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew 806</p>
<p>The union of your bed, with weeds so loathly 807</p>
<p>That you shall hate it both. Therefore take heed,</p>
<p>As Hymen 808 ’s lamps shall light you.</p>
<p>FERDINAND As I hope</p>
<p>For quiet days, fair issue 809 and long life,</p>
<p>With such love as ’tis now, the murkiest den,</p>
<p>The most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion</p>
<p>Our worser genius can 810 , shall never melt</p>
<p>Mine honour into lust, to take away</p>
<p>The edge of that day’s celebration</p>
<p>When I shall think or 811 Phoebus 812 ’ steeds are foundered 813
,</p>
<p>Or night kept chained below.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Fairly spoke.</p>
<p>Sit then and talk with her: she is thine own.</p>
<p>Ferdinand and Miranda sit and talk</p>
<p>What, Ariel! My industrious servant, Ariel!</p>
<p>Enter Ariel</p>
<p>ARIEL What would my potent master? Here I am.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service</p>
<p>Did worthily perform, and I must use you</p>
<p>In such another trick. Go bring the rabble 814 ,</p>
<p>O’er whom I give thee power, here to this place:</p>
<p>Incite them to quick motion, for I must</p>
<p>Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple</p>
<p>Some vanity 815 of mine art: it is my promise,</p>
<p>And they expect it from me.</p>
<p>ARIEL Presently 816 ?</p>
<p>PROSPERO Ay, with a twink 817 .</p>
<p>ARIEL Before you can say ‘come’ and ‘go’,</p>
<p>And breathe twice and cry ‘so, so’,</p>
<p>Each one, tripping on his toe,</p>
<p>Will be here with mop and mow 818 .</p>
<p>Do you love me, master? No?</p>
<p>PROSPERO Dearly, my delicate Ariel: do not approach</p>
<p>Till thou dost hear me call.</p>
<p>ARIEL Well: I conceive 819 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>PROSPERO Look thou be true 820 : do not give dalliance 821</p>
<p>To Ferdinand</p>
<p>Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw</p>
<p>To th’fire i’th’blood 822 : be more abstemious,</p>
<p>Or else goodnight 823 your vow.</p>
<p>FERDINAND I warrant you, sir,</p>
<p>The white cold virgin snow upon my heart</p>
<p>Abates the ardour of my liver 824 .</p>
<p>PROSPERO Well.</p>
<p>Now come, my Ariel! Bring a corollary 825 ,</p>
<p>Rather than want a spirit: appear, and pertly 826 .</p>
<p>No tongue! All eyes! Be silent.</p>
<p>Soft music. Enter Iris 827</p>
<p>IRIS Ceres 828 , most bounteous lady, thy rich leas 829</p>
<p>Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches 830 , oats and peas;</p>
<p>Thy turfy 831 mountains, where live nibbling sheep,</p>
<p>And flat meads 832 thatched with stover 833 , them to keep:</p>
<p>Thy banks with pionèd 834 and twillèd 835 brims 836 ,</p>
<p>Which spongy 837 April at thy hest 838 betrims 839</p>
<p>To make cold 840 nymphs chaste crowns 841 ; and thy broom-groves 842
,</p>
<p>Whose shadow the dismissèd 843 bachelor loves,</p>
<p>Being lass-lorn 844 : thy poll-clipped 845 vineyard,</p>
<p>And thy sea-marge 846 sterile and rocky-hard,</p>
<p>Where thou thyself dost air 847 : the queen o’th’sky 848 ,</p>
<p>Whose wat’ry arch 849 and messenger am I,</p>
<p>Bids thee leave these 850 , and with her sovereign grace,</p>
<p>Juno descends</p>
<p>In her chariot</p>
<p>Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,</p>
<p>To come and sport 851 . Her peacocks 852 fly amain 853 :</p>
<p>Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.</p>
<p>Enter Ceres</p>
<p>CERES Hail, many-coloured messenger, that ne’er</p>
<p>Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter 854 :</p>
<p>Who, with thy saffron 855 wings, upon my flowers</p>
<p>Diffusest honey drops 856 , refreshing showers,</p>
<p>And with each end of thy blue bow 857 dost crown</p>
<p>My bosky 858 acres and my unshrubbed down 859 ,</p>
<p>Rich scarf to my proud 860 earth: why hath thy queen</p>
<p>Summoned me hither to this short-grassed green?</p>
<p>IRIS A contract of true love to celebrate,</p>
<p>And some donation 861 freely to estate 862</p>
<p>On the blest lovers.</p>
<p>CERES Tell me, heavenly bow,</p>
<p>If Venus or her son 863 , as thou dost know,</p>
<p>Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot</p>
<p>The means that 864 dusky Dis 865 my daughter got,</p>
<p>Her and her blind boy’s 866 scandaled 867 company</p>
<p>I have forsworn 868 .</p>
<p>IRIS Of her society</p>
<p>Be not afraid: I met her deity</p>
<p>Cutting the clouds towards Paphos 869 , and her son</p>
<p>Dove-drawn 870 with her. Here thought they to have done</p>
<p>Some wanton 871 charm upon this man and maid,</p>
<p>Whose vows are that no bed-right 872 shall be paid</p>
<p>Till Hymen’s torch be lighted 873 — but in vain.</p>
<p>Mars’ hot minion 874 is returned again:</p>
<p>Her waspish-headed 875 son has broke his arrows,</p>
<p>Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows 876 ,</p>
<p>And be a boy right out 877 .</p>
<p>CERES Highest queen of state,</p>
<p>Great Juno, comes: I know her by her gait 878 .</p>
<p>Juno alights</p>
<p>JUNO How does my bounteous 879 sister? Go with me</p>
<p>To bless this twain 880 , that they may prosperous be,</p>
<p>And honoured in their issue.</p>
<p>JUNO Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,</p>
<p>They sing</p>
<p>Long continuance, and increasing 881 ,</p>
<p>Hourly joys be still 882 upon you,</p>
<p>Juno sings her blessings on you.</p>
<p>CERES Earth’s increase, foison 883 plenty,</p>
<p>Barns and garners 884 never empty,</p>
<p>Vines with clust’ring bunches growing,</p>
<p>Plants with goodly burden bowing:</p>
<p>Spring come to you at the farthest,</p>
<p>In the very end of harvest 885 .</p>
<p>Scarcity and want shall shun you,</p>
<p>Ceres’ blessing so is on you.</p>
<p>FERDINAND This is a most majestic vision, and</p>
<p>Harmonious charmingly 886 . May I be bold 887</p>
<p>To think these spirits?</p>
<p>PROSPERO Spirits, which by mine art</p>
<p>I have from their confines called to enact</p>
<p>My present fancies 888 .</p>
<p>FERDINAND Let me live here ever:</p>
<p>So rare a wondered 889 father, and a wise,</p>
<p>Makes this place paradise.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Sweet, now, silence!</p>
<p>Juno and Ceres whisper seriously 890 :</p>
<p>There’s something else to do. Hush, and be mute,</p>
<p>Or else our spell is marred.</p>
<p>Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment</p>
<p>IRIS You nymphs, called Naiads 891 , of the windring 892 brooks,</p>
<p>With your sedged 893 crowns and ever-harmless looks,</p>
<p>Leave your crisp channels 894 , and on this green land</p>
<p>Answer your summons: Juno does command.</p>
<p>Come, temperate 895 nymphs, and help to celebrate</p>
<p>A contract of true love: be not too late 896 .</p>
<p>Enter certain nymphs</p>
<p>You sunburned sicklemen 897 of August weary,</p>
<p>Come hither from the furrow 898 and be merry:</p>
<p>Make holiday: your rye-straw hats put on,</p>
<p>And these fresh nymphs encounter every one</p>
<p>In country footing 899 .</p>
<p>Enter certain reapers, properly habited 900 : they join with the
nymphs in a graceful dance, towards the end whereof Prospero starts
suddenly and speaks: after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused
noise, they heavily 901 vanish</p>
<p>PROSPERO I had forgot that foul conspiracy</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Of the beast Caliban and his confederates</p>
<p>Against my life: the minute of their plot</p>
<p>Is almost come.— Well done. Avoid 902 : no more!</p>
<p>To the spirits</p>
<p>FERDINAND This is strange: your father’s in some passion 903</p>
<p>To Miranda</p>
<p>That works him strongly.</p>
<p>MIRANDA Never till this day</p>
<p>Saw I him touched with anger, so distempered 904 .</p>
<p>PROSPERO You do look, my son, in a movèd sort 905 ,</p>
<p>As if you were dismayed: be cheerful, sir.</p>
<p>Our revels 906 now are ended. These our actors,</p>
<p>As I foretold you 907 , were all spirits and</p>
<p>Are melted into air, into thin air,</p>
<p>And, like the baseless 908 fabric 909 of this vision,</p>
<p>The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,</p>
<p>The solemn temples, the great globe 910 itself,</p>
<p>Yea, all 911 which it 912 inherit, shall dissolve,</p>
<p>And, like this insubstantial pageant 913 faded,</p>
<p>Leave not a rack 914 behind. We are such stuff</p>
<p>As dreams are made on; and our little life</p>
<p>Is rounded 915 with a sleep. Sir, I am vexed,</p>
<p>Bear with my weakness, my old brain is troubled:</p>
<p>Be not disturbed with my infirmity.</p>
<p>If you be pleased, retire into my cell 916</p>
<p>And there repose. A turn or two I’ll walk</p>
<p>To still my beating mind.</p>
<p>FERDINAND and MIRANDA We wish your peace.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Ferdinand and Miranda ]</p>
<p>PROSPERO Come with a thought 917 : I thank thee, Ariel: come!</p>
<p>Enter Ariel</p>
<p>ARIEL Thy thoughts I cleave to 918 : what’s thy pleasure?</p>
<p>PROSPERO Spirit, we must prepare to meet with Caliban.</p>
<p>ARIEL Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,</p>
<p>I thought to have told thee of it, but I feared</p>
<p>Lest I might anger thee.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets 919 ?</p>
<p>ARIEL I told you, sir, they were red-hot 920 with drinking,</p>
<p>So full of valour that they smote 921 the air</p>
<p>For breathing in their faces, beat the ground</p>
<p>For kissing of their feet: yet always bending 922</p>
<p>Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor,</p>
<p>At which, like unbacked colts 923 , they pricked their ears,</p>
<p>Advanced 924 their eyelids, lifted up their noses</p>
<p>As 925 they smelt music: so I charmed their ears,</p>
<p>That calf-like they my lowing 926 followed through</p>
<p>Toothed 927 briars, sharp furzes, pricking gorse and thorns 928 ,</p>
<p>Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them</p>
<p>I’th’filthy-mantled 929 pool beyond your cell,</p>
<p>There dancing up to th’chins, that 930 the foul lake</p>
<p>O’erstunk their feet 931 .</p>
<p>PROSPERO This was well done, my bird.</p>
<p>Thy shape invisible retain thou still 932 :</p>
<p>The trumpery 933 in my house, go bring it hither,</p>
<p>For stale 934 to catch these thieves.</p>
<p>ARIEL I go, I go.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>PROSPERO A devil, a born devil, on whose nature</p>
<p>Nurture can never stick: on whom my pains,</p>
<p>Humanely 935 taken, all, all lost 936 , quite lost.</p>
<p>And as with age his body uglier grows,</p>
<p>So his mind cankers 937 . I will plague them all,</p>
<p>Even to roaring 938 . Come, hang them on this line 939 .</p>
<p>Enter Ariel, loaden with glistering 940 apparel etc.</p>
<p>Ariel hangs up the finery</p>
<p>Enter Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo, all wet</p>
<p>Prospero and Ariel stand apart</p>
<p>CALIBAN Pray you, tread softly, that 941 the blind mole may not hear
a footfall: we now are near his cell.</p>
<p>STEPHANO Monster, your fairy 942 , which you say is a harmless fairy,
has done little better than played the jack with 943 us.</p>
<p>TRINCULO Monster, I do smell all horse-piss, at which my nose is in
great indignation.</p>
<p>STEPHANO So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take a
displeasure against you, look you—</p>
<p>TRINCULO Thou wert but a lost 944 monster.</p>
<p>CALIBAN Good my lord, give me thy favour still.</p>
<p>Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to</p>
<p>Shall hoodwink this mischance 945 : therefore speak softly,</p>
<p>All’s hushed as midnight yet.</p>
<p>TRINCULO Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool!</p>
<p>STEPHANO There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that, monster,
but an infinite loss.</p>
<p>TRINCULO That’s more to me than my wetting: yet this is your harmless
fairy, monster.</p>
<p>STEPHANO I will fetch off 946 my bottle, though I be o’er ears 947
for my labour.</p>
<p>CALIBAN Prithee, my king, be quiet. See’st thou here,</p>
<p>This is the mouth o’th’cell: no noise, and enter.</p>
<p>Do that good mischief 948 which may make this island</p>
<p>Thine own forever, and I thy Caliban</p>
<p>For aye 949 thy foot-licker.</p>
<p>STEPHANO Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.</p>
<p>TRINCULO O King Stephano, O peer 950 ! O worthy Stephano, look what a
wardrobe here is for thee!</p>
<p>Sees the apparel</p>
<p>CALIBAN Let it alone, thou fool: it is but trash.</p>
<p>TRINCULO O, ho, monster: we know what belongs to a frippery 951 . O
King Stephano!</p>
<p>Puts on a gown</p>
<p>STEPHANO Put off that gown, Trinculo: by this hand, I’ll have that
gown.</p>
<p>TRINCULO Thy grace shall have it.</p>
<p>CALIBAN The dropsy 952 drown this fool: what do you mean</p>
<p>To dote thus on such luggage 953 ? Let’s alone</p>
<p>And do the murder first: if he awake,</p>
<p>From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches,</p>
<p>Make us strange stuff 954 .</p>
<p>STEPHANO Be you quiet, monster.— Mistress line 955 , is not this my
jerkin 956 ? Now is the jerkin under the line 957 : now, jerkin, you are
like to lose your hair 958 and prove a bald jerkin.</p>
<p>Takes it down</p>
<p>TRINCULO Do, do: we steal by line and level 959 , an’t like 960 your
grace.</p>
<p>STEPHANO I thank thee for that jest: here’s a garment for’t: wit
shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country. ‘Steal by line
and level’ is an excellent pass of pate 961 : there’s another garment
for’t.</p>
<p>Gives Trinculo a garment</p>
<p>Gives another</p>
<p>TRINCULO Monster, come put some lime 962 upon your fingers, and away
with the rest.</p>
<p>CALIBAN I will have none on’t: we shall lose our time,</p>
<p>And all be turned to barnacles 963 , or to apes</p>
<p>With foreheads villainous 964 low.</p>
<p>STEPHANO Monster, lay to your 965 fingers: help to bear this away
where my hogshead 966 of wine is, or I’ll turn you out of my kingdom: go
to, carry this.</p>
<p>TRINCULO And this.</p>
<p>They load Caliban with garments</p>
<p>STEPHANO Ay, and this.</p>
<p>A noise of hunters heard. Enter diverse 967 spirits, in shape of dogs
and hounds, hunting them about, Prospero and Ariel setting them on</p>
<p>PROSPERO Hey, Mountain, hey!</p>
<p>ARIEL Silver! There it goes, Silver!</p>
<p>PROSPERO Fury, Fury! There, Tyrant 968 , there: hark! Hark!</p>
<p>Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo are driven out</p>
<p>Go, charge my goblins that they grind 969 their joints</p>
<p>To Ariel</p>
<p>With dry convulsions 970 , shorten up 971 their sinews</p>
<p>With agèd cramps 972 , and more pinch-spotted 973 make them</p>
<p>Than pard 974 or cat o’mountain 975 .</p>
<p>ARIEL Hark, they roar.</p>
<p>PROSPERO Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour</p>
<p>Lies at my mercy all mine enemies:</p>
<p>Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou</p>
<p>Shalt have the air at freedom 976 : for a little 977 ,</p>
<p>Follow, and do me service.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
