<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-4">Scene 1 ／ running scene 4</h4>
<p>Enter Leonato, [Antonio ] his brother, [Innogen ] his wife, Hero his
daughter [attended by Margaret and Ursula ], and Beatrice his niece and
a Kinsman 223</p>
<p>LEONATO Was not Count John here at supper?</p>
<p>ANTONIO I saw him not.</p>
<p>BEATRICE How tartly 224 that gentleman looks. I never can see him but
I am heart-burned 225 an hour after.</p>
<p>HERO He is of a very melancholy disposition.</p>
<p>BEATRICE He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway
between him and Benedick: the one is too like an image 226 and says
nothing, and the other too like my lady’s eldest son 227 , evermore
tattling.</p>
<p>LEONATO Then half Signior Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth,
and half Count John’s melancholy in Signior Benedick’s face —</p>
<p>BEATRICE With a good 228 leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough
in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if he could
get her good will.</p>
<p>LEONATO By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband if
thou be so shrewd 229 of thy tongue.</p>
<p>ANTONIO In faith, she’s too curst 230 .</p>
<p>BEATRICE Too curst is more than curst. I shall lessen God’s sending
that way, for it is said: ‘God sends a curst cow short horns 231’, but
to a cow too curst he sends none.</p>
<p>LEONATO So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Just 232 , if he send me no husband, for the which blessing
I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord, I could not
endure a husband with a beard on his face! I had rather lie in the
woollen 233 .</p>
<p>LEONATO You may light upon a husband that hath no beard.</p>
<p>BEATRICE What should I do with him? Dress him in my apparel 234 and
make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a
youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man: and he that is more
than a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a man, I am not for
him. Therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest 235 of the bearward
236 and lead his apes into hell 237 .</p>
<p>LEONATO Well then, go you into hell.</p>
<p>BEATRICE No, but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like
an old cuckold with horns on his head, and say ‘Get you to heaven,
Beatrice, get you to heaven, here’s no place for you maids 238 .’ So
deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter 239 , for the heavens 240
. He shows me where the bachelors 241 sit, and there live we as merry as
the day is long.</p>
<p>ANTONIO Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.</p>
<p>To Hero</p>
<p>BEATRICE Yes, faith, it is my cousin’s duty to make curtsy and say
‘Father, as it please you’: but yet for all that, cousin, let him be a
handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy and say ‘Father, as it
please me.’</p>
<p>LEONATO Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted 242 with a
husband.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Not till God make men of some other metal 243 than earth 244
. Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant
dust? To make account of her life to a clod of wayward marl 245 ? No,
uncle, I’ll none: Adam’s sons are my brethren 246 , and truly I hold it
a sin to match in my kindred 247 .</p>
<p>LEONATO Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince do solicit
248 you in that kind 249 , you know your answer.</p>
<p>To Hero</p>
<p>BEATRICE The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed
in good time 250 . If the prince be too important 251 , tell him there
is measure 252 in everything, and so dance out the answer. For hear me,
Hero: wooing, wedding and repenting is as a Scotch jig 253 , a measure
254 and a cinque-pace 255 : the first suit 256 is hot 257 and hasty like
a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical 258 , the wedding mannerly-modest
259 as a measure, full of state and ancientry 260 , and then comes
repentance and, with his bad legs 261 , falls into the cinque-pace
faster and faster, till he sinks into his grave.</p>
<p>LEONATO Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly 262 .</p>
<p>BEATRICE I have a good eye, uncle, I can see a church by
daylight.</p>
<p>LEONATO The revellers are entering, brother. Make good room.</p>
<p>All put on their masks</p>
<p>Enter Prince [Don ] Pedro, Claudio, and Benedick, and Balthasar, [Don
] John, [Borachio, Margaret, Ursula and other ] Masquers with a drum</p>
<p>Couples pair-up and begin dancing</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Lady, will you walk a bout with your friend 263 ?</p>
<p>HERO So 264 you walk softly, and look sweetly, and say nothing, I am
yours for the walk, and especially when I walk away.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO With me in your company?</p>
<p>HERO I may say so when I please.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO And when please you to say so?</p>
<p>HERO When I like your favour 265 , for God defend the lute should be
like the case 266 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO My visor 267 is Philemon’s roof, within the house is Jove
268 .</p>
<p>HERO Why then your visor should be thatched 269 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Speak low, if you speak love.</p>
<p>They dance aside</p>
<p>BALTHASAR Well, I would you did like me.</p>
<p>MARGARET So would not I for your own sake, for I have many ill
qualities.</p>
<p>BALTHASAR Which is one?</p>
<p>MARGARET I say my prayers aloud.</p>
<p>BALTHASAR I love you the better. The hearers may cry ‘Amen’.</p>
<p>MARGARET God match me with a good dancer.</p>
<p>BALTHASAR Amen.</p>
<p>MARGARET And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done.
Answer, clerk 270 .</p>
<p>BALTHASAR No more words: the clerk is answered.</p>
<p>They dance aside</p>
<p>URSULA I know you well enough, you are Signior Antonio.</p>
<p>ANTONIO At a word 271 , I am not.</p>
<p>URSULA I know you by the waggling 272 of your head.</p>
<p>ANTONIO To tell you true, I counterfeit 273 him.</p>
<p>URSULA You could never do him so ill-well 274 , unless you were the
very man. Here’s his dry hand 275 up and down 276 : you are he, you are
he.</p>
<p>ANTONIO At a word, I am not.</p>
<p>URSULA Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your excellent
wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum 277 , you are he. Graces 278
will appear, and there’s an end.</p>
<p>They dance aside</p>
<p>BEATRICE Will you not tell me who told you so?</p>
<p>BENEDICK No, you shall pardon me.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Nor will you not tell me who you are?</p>
<p>BENEDICK Not now.</p>
<p>BEATRICE That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit out of the
‘Hundred Merry Tales’ 279 — well, this was Signior Benedick that said
so.</p>
<p>BENEDICK What’s he?</p>
<p>BEATRICE I am sure you know him well enough.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Not I, believe me.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Did he never make you laugh?</p>
<p>BENEDICK I pray you, what is he?</p>
<p>BEATRICE Why, he is the prince’s jester, a very dull fool, only his
280 gift is in devising impossible 281 slanders. None but libertines 282
delight in him, and the commendation is not in his wit, but in his
villainy 283 , for he both pleaseth men and angers them 284 , and then
they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the fleet 285 . I
would he had boarded 286 me.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>BENEDICK When I know the gentleman, I’ll tell him what you say.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Do, do: he’ll but break 287 a comparison 288 or two on me,
which peradventure — not marked or not laughed at — strikes him into
melancholy, and then there’s a partridge wing 289 saved, for the fool
will eat no supper that night. We must follow the leaders 290 .</p>
<p>Music</p>
<p>BENEDICK In every good thing.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next
turning.</p>
<p>Music for the Dance. [Then ] exeunt [dancing, all except Don John,
Borachio and Claudio ]</p>
<p>DON JOHN Sure my brother is amorous on 291 Hero and hath withdrawn
her father to break with him about it. The ladies follow her and but one
visor remains.</p>
<p>Aside to Borachio</p>
<p>BORACHIO And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.</p>
<p>DON JOHN Are not you Signior Benedick?</p>
<p>To Claudio</p>
<p>CLAUDIO You know me well, I am he.</p>
<p>DON JOHN Signior, you are very near my brother in his love 292 . He
is enamoured on Hero. I pray you dissuade him from her, she is no equal
for his birth. You may do the part of an honest man in it.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO How know you he loves her?</p>
<p>DON JOHN I heard him swear his affection.</p>
<p>BORACHIO So did I too, and he swore he would marry her tonight.</p>
<p>DON JOHN Come, let us to the banquet 293 .</p>
<p>Exeunt [Don John and Borachio ]</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,</p>
<p>But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.</p>
<p>’Tis certain so, the prince woos for himself.</p>
<p>Friendship is constant 294 in all other things</p>
<p>Save in the office 295 and affairs of love.</p>
<p>Therefore all 296 hearts in love use their own tongues,</p>
<p>Let every eye negotiate for itself</p>
<p>And trust no agent, for beauty is a witch</p>
<p>Against whose charms faith 297 melteth into blood 298 .</p>
<p>This is an accident of hourly proof 299 ,</p>
<p>Which I mistrusted 300 not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!</p>
<p>Enter Benedick</p>
<p>BENEDICK Count Claudio?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Yea, the same.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Come, will you go with me?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Whither?</p>
<p>BENEDICK Even to the next willow 301 , about your own business,
count. What fashion will you wear the garland of? About your neck, like
an usurer’s chain 302 ? Or under your arm, like a lieutenant’s scarf 303
? You must wear it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO I wish him joy of her.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Why, that’s spoken like an honest drover 304 , so 305 they
sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would have served you
thus?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO I pray you leave me.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Ho, now you strike like the blind man: ’twas the boy that
stole your meat, and you’ll beat the post 306 307 .</p>
<p>CLAUDIO If it will not be 308 , I’ll leave you.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>BENEDICK Alas, poor hurt fowl 309 , now will he creep into sedges 310
. But that my Lady Beatrice should know me and not 311 know me! The
prince’s fool! Ha? It may be I go under that title because I am merry.
Yea, but so 312 I am apt to do myself wrong. I am not so reputed: it is
the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice that puts the world
into her person and so gives me out 313 . Well, I’ll be revenged as I
may.</p>
<p>Enter the Prince [Don Pedro ]</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Now, signior, where’s the count? Did you see him?</p>
<p>BENEDICK Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame 314 315
. I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren 316 . I told
him, and I think I told him true, that your grace had got the good will
of this young lady, and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,
either to make him a garland, as being forsaken 317 , or to bind him a
rod 318 , as being worthy to be whipped.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO To be whipped? What’s his fault?</p>
<p>BENEDICK The flat transgression 319 of a schoolboy, who, being
overjoyed with finding a bird’s nest, shows it his companion, and he
steals it.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Wilt thou make a trust 320 a transgression? The
transgression is in the stealer.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the
garland too: for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he
might have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen his bird’s
nest.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO I will but teach them 321 to sing, and restore them to the
owner.</p>
<p>BENEDICK If their singing answer your saying, by my faith you say
honestly 322 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to 323 you: the gentleman
that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you.</p>
<p>BENEDICK O, she misused 324 me past the endurance of a block 325 ! An
oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her. My very visor
began to assume life and scold with her. She told me — not thinking I
had been myself — that I was the prince’s jester, and that I was duller
than a great thaw 326 , huddling 327 jest upon jest with such impossible
conveyance 328 upon me that I stood like a man at a mark 329 , with a
whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards 330 , and every word
stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her terminations 331 , there
were no living near her, she would infect to the North Star. I would not
marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him
before he transgressed 332 . She would have made Hercules have turned
spit, yea, and have cleft 333 his club to make the fire too 334 . Come,
talk not of her, you shall find her the infernal Ate 335 in good
apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure 336 her, for
certainly, while she is here 337 , a man may live as quiet in hell as in
a sanctuary 338 , and people sin upon purpose, because they would go
thither: so indeed all disquiet, horror and perturbation follows
her.</p>
<p>Enter Claudio and Beatrice, Leonato [and ] Hero</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Look, here she comes.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Will your grace command me any service to the world’s end? I
will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes 339 that you can
devise to send me on: I will fetch you a tooth-picker 340 now from the
furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of Prester John 341 ‘s foot,
fetch you a hair off the great Cham 342 ’s beard, do you any embassage
to the Pygmies 343 , rather than hold three words’ conference with this
harpy 344 . You have no employment for me?</p>
<p>DON PEDRO None, but to desire your good company.</p>
<p>BENEDICK O God, sir, here’s a dish I love not: I cannot endure this
Lady Tongue.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Come, lady, come, you have lost the heart of Signior
Benedick.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile, and I gave him use
345 for it, a double 346 heart for his single one: marry, once before he
won it of me with false dice 347 , therefore your Grace may well say I
have lost it.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO You have put him down 348 , lady, you have put him
down.</p>
<p>BEATRICE So I would not he should do 349 me, my lord, lest I should
prove the mother of fools. I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent
me to seek.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Why, how now, count? Wherefore 350 are you sad?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Not sad, my lord.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO How then? Sick?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Neither, my lord.</p>
<p>BEATRICE The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well: but
civil 351 count, civil as an orange, and something of a jealous
complexion 352 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO I’faith, lady, I think your blazon 353 to be true, though
I’ll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit 354 is false. Here, Claudio, I
have wooed in thy name, and fair Hero is won: I have broke with her
father, and his good will obtained. Name the day of marriage, and God
give thee joy!</p>
<p>LEONATO Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes. His
grace 355 hath made the match, and all grace say ‘Amen’ to it.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Speak, count, ’tis your cue.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Silence is the perfectest herald 356 of joy. I were but
little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as you are mine, I am
yours. I give away myself for you and dote upon 357 the exchange.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Speak, cousin, or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a
kiss, and let not him speak neither.</p>
<p>Claudio and Hero kiss?</p>
<p>DON PEDRO In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Yea, my lord, I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy
side of care 358 . My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her
heart.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO And so she doth, cousin.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Good lord, for alliance 359 ! Thus goes everyone to the
world 360 but I, and I am sunburnt 361 . I may sit in a corner and cry
‘Hey-ho for a husband!’ 362</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.</p>
<p>BEATRICE I would rather have one of your father’s getting 363 . Hath
your grace ne’er a brother like you? Your father got excellent husbands,
if a maid could come by them.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Will you have me, lady?</p>
<p>BEATRICE No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days:
your grace is too costly to wear every day. But I beseech your grace
pardon me. I was born to speak all mirth and no matter 364 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Your silence most offends me 365 , and to be merry best
becomes 366 you, for out of question, you were born in a merry hour.</p>
<p>BEATRICE No, sure, my lord, my mother cried 367 , but then there was
a star danced, and under that was I born. Cousins, God give you joy!</p>
<p>LEONATO Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?</p>
<p>BEATRICE I cry you mercy 368 , uncle.— By your grace’s pardon 369
.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>To Don Pedro</p>
<p>DON PEDRO By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.</p>
<p>LEONATO There’s little of the melancholy element 370 in her, my lord:
she is never 371 sad but when she sleeps, and not ever sad then, for I
have heard my daughter say, she hath often dreamt of unhappiness and
waked herself with laughing.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.</p>
<p>LEONATO O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit 372
.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO She were an excellent wife for Benedick.</p>
<p>LEONATO O lord, my lord, if they were but a week married, they would
talk themselves mad.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Count Claudio, when mean you to go to church?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Tomorrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches till love have all
his rites.</p>
<p>LEONATO Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just
seven-night 373 , and a time too brief, too, to have all things answer
my mind.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing 374 . But I
warrant 375 thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us. I will in
the interim undertake one of Hercules’ labours 376 , which is to bring
Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection,
th’one with th’other. I would fain 377 have it a match, and I doubt not
but to fashion it, if you three will but minister 378 such assistance as
I shall give you direction.</p>
<p>LEONATO My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights’
watchings 379 .</p>
<p>CLAUDIO And I, my lord.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO And you too, gentle Hero?</p>
<p>HERO I will do any modest 380 office, my lord, to help my cousin to a
good husband.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO And Benedick is not the unhopefullest 381 husband that I
know. Thus far can I praise him: he is of a noble strain 382 , of
approved 383 valour and confirmed honesty 384 . I will teach you how to
humour your cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick, and I,
with your two helps, will so practise on 385 Benedick that, in despite
of his quick wit and his queasy stomach 386 , he shall fall in love with
Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory
shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me, and I will
tell you my drift 387 .</p>
<p>To Leonato and Claudio</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
