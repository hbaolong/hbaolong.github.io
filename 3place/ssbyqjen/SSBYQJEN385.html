<h4 id="scene-1-847-running-scene-9">Scene 1 847 / running scene 9</h4>
<p>Flourish. Enter Lucius with an army of Goths with Drum 848 and
Soldiers</p>
<p>LUCIUS Approvèd 849 warriors and my faithful friends,</p>
<p>I have receivèd letters from great Rome</p>
<p>Which signifies what hate they bear their emperor,</p>
<p>And how desirous of our sight they are.</p>
<p>Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness 850 ,</p>
<p>Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,</p>
<p>And wherein Rome hath done you any scathe 851</p>
<p>Let him make treble satisfaction.</p>
<p>FIRST GOTH Brave slip 852 sprung from the great Andronicus,</p>
<p>Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort,</p>
<p>Whose high exploits and honourable deeds</p>
<p>Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,</p>
<p>Be bold 853 in us. We’ll follow where thou lead’st,</p>
<p>Like stinging bees in hottest summer’s day</p>
<p>Led by their master 854 to the flowered fields,</p>
<p>And be avenged on cursèd Tamora.</p>
<p>ALL THE GOTHS And as he saith, so say we all with him.</p>
<p>LUCIUS I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.</p>
<p>But who comes here, led by a lusty 855 Goth?</p>
<p>Enter a Goth, leading of Aaron with his child in his arms</p>
<p>SECOND GOTH Renownèd Lucius, from our troops I strayed</p>
<p>To gaze upon a ruinous monastery,</p>
<p>And as I earnestly 856 did fix mine eye</p>
<p>Upon the wasted building, suddenly</p>
<p>I heard a child cry underneath a wall.</p>
<p>I made unto the noise, when soon I heard</p>
<p>The crying babe controlled 857 with this discourse:</p>
<p>’Peace, tawny 858 slave, half me and half thy dam!</p>
<p>Did not thy hue bewray 859 whose brat 860 thou art,</p>
<p>Had nature lent thee but thy mother’s look,</p>
<p>Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor.</p>
<p>But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,</p>
<p>They never do beget a coal-black calf.</p>
<p>Peace, villain, peace!’ — even thus he rates 861 the babe —</p>
<p>’For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth</p>
<p>Who, when he knows thou art the empress’ babe,</p>
<p>Will hold thee dearly for thy mother’s sake.’</p>
<p>With this, my weapon drawn, I rushed upon him,</p>
<p>Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither</p>
<p>To use as you think needful of the man 862 .</p>
<p>LUCIUS O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil</p>
<p>That robbed Andronicus of his good hand,</p>
<p>This is the pearl that pleased your empress’ eye 863 ,</p>
<p>And here’s the base fruit 864 of his burning lust.—</p>
<p>Say, wall-eyed 865 slave, whither wouldst thou convey</p>
<p>To Aaron</p>
<p>This growing image of thy fiend-like face?</p>
<p>Why dost not speak? What, deaf? Not a word?</p>
<p>A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,</p>
<p>And by his side his fruit of bastardy.</p>
<p>AARON Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Too like the sire 866 for ever being good.</p>
<p>First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl 867 :</p>
<p>A sight to vex the father’s soul withal 868 .</p>
<p>Get me a ladder.</p>
<p>A ladder is brought, which Aaron is made to climb</p>
<p>AARON Lucius, save the child,</p>
<p>A Goth takes the child</p>
<p>And bear it from me to the emperess.</p>
<p>If thou do this, I’ll show thee wondrous things</p>
<p>That highly may advantage thee to hear.</p>
<p>If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,</p>
<p>I’ll speak no more but ‘Vengeance rot you all!’</p>
<p>LUCIUS Say on, an if it please me which thou speak’st,</p>
<p>Thy child shall live and I will see it nourished.</p>
<p>AARON An if it please thee? Why, assure thee, Lucius,</p>
<p>’Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak,</p>
<p>For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,</p>
<p>Acts of black night, abominable deeds,</p>
<p>Complots 869 of mischief 870 , treason, villainies</p>
<p>Ruthful to hear yet piteously performed 871 :</p>
<p>And this shall all be buried by my death</p>
<p>Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Tell on thy mind, I say thy child shall live.</p>
<p>AARON Swear that he shall and then I will begin.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god:</p>
<p>That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?</p>
<p>AARON What if I do not? — As indeed I do not —</p>
<p>Yet for 872 I know thou art religious</p>
<p>And hast a thing within thee called conscience,</p>
<p>With twenty popish 873 tricks and ceremonies</p>
<p>Which I have seen thee careful to observe:</p>
<p>Therefore I urge thy oath, for that I know</p>
<p>An idiot holds his bauble 874 for a god</p>
<p>And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,</p>
<p>To that I’ll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow</p>
<p>By that same god, what god soe’er it be,</p>
<p>That thou ador’st and hast in reverence,</p>
<p>To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up,</p>
<p>Or else I will discover 875 nought to thee.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Even by my god I swear to thee I will.</p>
<p>AARON First know thou I begot him on the empress.</p>
<p>LUCIUS O most insatiate, luxurious 876 woman!</p>
<p>AARON Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity</p>
<p>To 877 that which thou shalt hear of me anon.</p>
<p>’Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus,</p>
<p>They cut thy sister’s tongue and ravished her</p>
<p>And cut her hands off and trimmed 878 her as thou saw’st.</p>
<p>LUCIUS O detestable villain! Call’st thou that trimming?</p>
<p>AARON Why, she was washed and cut and trimmed 879 , and ’twas</p>
<p>Trim 880 sport for them that had the doing of it.</p>
<p>LUCIUS O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!</p>
<p>AARON Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.</p>
<p>That codding 881 spirit had they from their mother,</p>
<p>As sure a card as ever won the set 882 :</p>
<p>That bloody 883 mind, I think, they learned of me,</p>
<p>As true a dog as ever fought at head 884 .</p>
<p>Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.</p>
<p>I trained 885 thy brethren to that guileful hole</p>
<p>Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:</p>
<p>I wrote the letter that thy father found,</p>
<p>And hid the gold within the letter mentioned,</p>
<p>Confederate 886 with the queen and her two sons:</p>
<p>And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue</p>
<p>Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?</p>
<p>I played the cheater 887 for thy father’s hand,</p>
<p>And when I had it, drew myself apart</p>
<p>And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:</p>
<p>I pried me 888 through the crevice of a wall</p>
<p>When for his hand he had his two sons’ heads,</p>
<p>Beheld his tears and laughed so heartily</p>
<p>That both mine eyes were rainy like to his.</p>
<p>And when I told the empress of this sport,</p>
<p>She swoonèd almost at my pleasing tale</p>
<p>And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.</p>
<p>A GOTH What, canst thou say all this and never blush?</p>
<p>AARON Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is 889 .</p>
<p>LUCIUS Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?</p>
<p>AARON Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.</p>
<p>Even now I curse the day — and yet I think</p>
<p>Few come within the compass of my curse —</p>
<p>Wherein I did not some notorious ill,</p>
<p>As kill a man or else devise his death,</p>
<p>Ravish a maid or plot the way to do it,</p>
<p>Accuse some innocent and forswear myself 890 ,</p>
<p>Set deadly enmity between two friends,</p>
<p>Make poor men’s cattle break their necks,</p>
<p>Set fire on barns and haystacks in the night</p>
<p>And bid the owners quench them with their tears.</p>
<p>Oft have I digged up dead men from their graves</p>
<p>And set them upright at their dear friends’ door,</p>
<p>Even when their sorrows almost was forgot,</p>
<p>And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,</p>
<p>Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,</p>
<p>‘Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.’</p>
<p>Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things</p>
<p>As willingly as one would kill a fly,</p>
<p>And nothing grieves me heartily indeed</p>
<p>But that I cannot do ten thousand more.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Bring down the devil, for he must not die</p>
<p>So sweet a death as hanging presently 891 .</p>
<p>Aaron is made to climb down</p>
<p>AARON If there be devils, would I were a devil,</p>
<p>To live and burn in everlasting fire,</p>
<p>So I might have your company in hell,</p>
<p>But to torment you with my bitter tongue.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Sirs, stop his mouth and let him speak no more.</p>
<p>Aaron is gagged</p>
<p>Enter Emillius</p>
<p>A GOTH My lord, there is a messenger from Rome</p>
<p>Desires to be admitted to your presence.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Let him come near.</p>
<p>Welcome, Emillius what’s the news from Rome?</p>
<p>EMILLIUS Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,</p>
<p>The Roman emperor greets you all by me,</p>
<p>And for 892 he understands you are in arms,</p>
<p>He craves a parley at your father’s house,</p>
<p>Willing you to demand your hostages 893 ,</p>
<p>And they shall be immediately delivered.</p>
<p>A GOTH What says our general?</p>
<p>LUCIUS Emillius, let the emperor give his pledges</p>
<p>Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,</p>
<p>And we will come. March away.</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt</p>
