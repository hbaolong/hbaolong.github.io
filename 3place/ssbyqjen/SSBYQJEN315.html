<h4 id="scene-3-906-running-scene-5">Scene 3 906 / running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter Thersites, solus 907</p>
<p>THERSITES How now, Thersites? What, lost in the labyrinth of thy
fury? Shall the elephant 908 Ajax carry it 909 thus? He beats me, and I
rail 910 at him. O, worthy satisfaction 911 ! Would 912 it were
otherwise: that I could beat him, whilst he railed at me. ‘Sfoot 913 ,
I’ll learn to conjure 914 and raise devils, but I’ll see 915 some issue
of my spiteful execrations. Then there’s Achilles, a rare 916 engineer
917 . If Troy be not taken till these two undermine 918 it, the walls
will stand till they fall of themselves 919 . O thou great
thunder-darter 920 of Olympus, forget that thou art Jove, the king of
gods and, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft 921 of thy caduceus 922
, if thou take not that little, little, less than little wit from them
that they have, which short-armed 923 ignorance itself knows is so
abundant scarce, it will not in circumvention 924 deliver 925 a fly from
a spider without drawing the massy 926 irons 927 and cutting the web.
After 928 this, the vengeance on the whole camp! Or, rather, the
bone-ache 929 , for that, methinks, is the curse dependent on 930 those
that war for a placket 931 . I have said my prayers and devil Envy say
’Amen’.— What ho? My lord Achilles?</p>
<p>Enter Patroclus [from the tent ]</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Who’s there? Thersites? Good Thersites, come in and
rail.</p>
<p>Patroclus returns to the tent</p>
<p>THERSITES If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit 932 , thou
wouldst not have slipped 933 out of my contemplation. But it is no
matter: thyself upon thyself 934 ! The common curse of mankind, folly
and ignorance, be thine in great revenue 935 ! Heaven bless 936 thee
from a tutor, and discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood 937 be
thy direction 938 till thy death! Then if she that lays thee out 939
says thou art a fair 940 corpse, I’ll be sworn and sworn upon’t she
never shrouded 941 any but lazars 942 . Amen.— Where’s Achilles?</p>
<p>Patroclus re-emerges from the tent</p>
<p>PATROCLUS What, art thou devout? Wast thou in a prayer?</p>
<p>THERSITES Ay, the heavens hear me!</p>
<p>Enter Achilles [from the tent ]</p>
<p>ACHILLES Who’s there?</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Thersites, my lord.</p>
<p>ACHILLES Where, where? Art thou come? Why, my cheese 943 , my
digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals
944 ? Come, what’s Agamemnon?</p>
<p>THERSITES Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus, what’s
Achilles?</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee, what’s
thyself?</p>
<p>THERSITES Thy knower 945 , Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus, what
art thou?</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Thou mayst tell that know’st.</p>
<p>ACHILLES O, tell, tell.</p>
<p>THERSITES I’ll decline 946 the whole question: Agamemnon commands
Achilles, Achilles is my lord, I am Patroclus’ knower, and Patroclus is
a fool.</p>
<p>PATROCLUS You rascal!</p>
<p>THERSITES Peace, fool, I have not done 947 .</p>
<p>ACHILLES He is a privileged man 948 . Proceed, Thersites.</p>
<p>THERSITES Agamemnon is a fool, Achilles is a fool, Thersites is a
fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.</p>
<p>ACHILLES Derive 949 this: come.</p>
<p>THERSITES Agamemnon is a fool to offer 950 to command Achilles,
Achilles is a fool to be commanded of 951 Agamemnon, Thersites is a fool
to serve such a fool, and Patroclus is a fool positive 952 .</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Why am I a fool?</p>
<p>Enter Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor, Diomedes, Ajax and Calchas [at a
distance ]</p>
<p>THERSITES Make that demand to 953 the creator: it suffices 954 me
thou art. Look you, who comes here?</p>
<p>ACHILLES Patroclus, I’ll speak with nobody. Come in with me,
Thersites.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>THERSITES Here is such patchery 955 , such juggling 956 and such
knavery! All the argument 957 is a cuckold and a whore 958 , a good
quarrel to draw 959 emulations, factions and bleed to death upon. Now,
the dry serpigo 960 on the subject 961 , and war and lechery confound
962 all!</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Where is Achilles?</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Within his tent, but ill disposed 963 , my lord.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Let it be known to him that we are here.</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>He shent 964 our messengers, and we lay by 965</p>
<p>Our appertainments 966 , visiting of 967 him:</p>
<p>Let him be told of 968 , so 969 perchance he think</p>
<p>We dare not move the question of our place 970 ,</p>
<p>Or know not what we are.</p>
<p>PATROCLUS I shall so say to him.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>ULYSSES We saw him at the opening of his tent:</p>
<p>He is not sick.</p>
<p>AJAX Yes, lion-sick 971 , sick of proud heart: you may call it
melancholy if you will favour the man, but, by my head, it is pride. But
why, why? Let him show us the cause.— A word, my lord.</p>
<p>Ajax and Agamemnon speak aside</p>
<p>NESTOR What moves Ajax thus to bay 972 at him?</p>
<p>ULYSSES Achilles hath inveigled 973 his fool from him.</p>
<p>NESTOR Who, Thersites?</p>
<p>ULYSSES He.</p>
<p>NESTOR Then will Ajax lack matter 974 , if he have lost his argument
975 .</p>
<p>ULYSSES No, you see, he is his argument that has his argument —
Achilles 976 .</p>
<p>NESTOR All the better: their fraction is more our wish than their
faction 977 , but it was a strong council that a fool could disunite 978
.</p>
<p>ULYSSES The amity 979 that wisdom knits not, folly may easily
untie.</p>
<p>Enter Patroclus</p>
<p>Here comes Patroclus.</p>
<p>NESTOR No Achilles with him?</p>
<p>ULYSSES The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy 980 : his
legs are legs for necessity, not for flight.</p>
<p>PATROCLUS Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry</p>
<p>If anything more than your sport 981 and pleasure</p>
<p>Did move your greatness and this noble state 982</p>
<p>To call upon him; he hopes it is no other 983</p>
<p>But for your health and your digestion’ sake,</p>
<p>An after-dinner’s breath 984 .</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Hear you, Patroclus:</p>
<p>We are too well acquainted with these answers,</p>
<p>But his evasion, winged thus swift with scorn,</p>
<p>Cannot outfly our apprehensions 985 .</p>
<p>Much attribute 986 he hath, and much the reason</p>
<p>Why we ascribe it to him, yet all his virtues,</p>
<p>Not virtuously of his own part beheld 987 ,</p>
<p>Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,</p>
<p>Yea, and like fair 988 fruit in an unwholesome 989 dish,</p>
<p>Are like 990 to rot untasted. Go and tell him,</p>
<p>We came to speak with him; and you shall not sin 991</p>
<p>If you do say we think him over-proud</p>
<p>And under-honest 992 , in self-assumption greater</p>
<p>Than in the note of judgement 993 , and worthier than himself</p>
<p>Here tends the savage strangeness he puts on 994 ,</p>
<p>Disguise the holy strength of their command 995 ,</p>
<p>And underwrite in an observing kind</p>
<p>His humorous predominance 996 . Yea, watch</p>
<p>His pettish lunes 997 , his ebbs, his flows, as if</p>
<p>The passage 998 and whole carriage 999 of this action 1000</p>
<p>Rode on his tide 1001 . Go tell him this, and add</p>
<p>That if he overhold 1002 his price so much,</p>
<p>We’ll none of 1003 him; but let him, like an engine 1004</p>
<p>Not portable, lie under 1005 this report:</p>
<p>’Bring action hither, this 1006 cannot go to war:</p>
<p>A stirring 1007 dwarf we do allowance 1008 give</p>
<p>Before 1009 a sleeping giant.’ Tell him so.</p>
<p>PATROCLUS I shall, and bring his answer presently 1010 .</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON In second voice 1011 we’ll not be satisfied:</p>
<p>We come to speak with him.— Ulysses, enter you.</p>
<p>Exit Ulysses [following Patroclus ]</p>
<p>AJAX What is he more than another?</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON No more than what he thinks he is.</p>
<p>AJAX Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a better man
than I am?</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON No question.</p>
<p>AJAX Will you subscribe 1012 his thought, and say he is?</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON No, noble Ajax: you are as strong, as valiant, as wise, no
less noble, much more gentle 1013 , and altogether more tractable.</p>
<p>AJAX Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not what
it is.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Your mind is the clearer 1014 , Ajax, and your virtues the
fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is his own glass 1015 ,
his own trumpet 1016 , his own chronicle 1017 , and whatever praises
itself but in the deed 1018 , devours 1019 the deed in the praise.</p>
<p>Enter Ulysses</p>
<p>AJAX I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering 1020 of
toads.</p>
<p>NESTOR Yet he loves himself: is’t not strange?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>ULYSSES Achilles will not to the field 1021 tomorrow.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON What’s his excuse?</p>
<p>ULYSSES He doth rely on none,</p>
<p>But carries on the stream of his dispose 1022</p>
<p>Without observance 1023 or respect 1024 of any,</p>
<p>In will peculiar 1025 and in self-admission 1026 .</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Why will he not upon our fair 1027 request</p>
<p>Untent his person 1028 and share the air with us?</p>
<p>ULYSSES Things small as nothing, for request’s sake only 1029 ,</p>
<p>He makes important: possessed he is with greatness 1030 ,</p>
<p>And speaks not to himself but with a pride</p>
<p>That quarrels at self-breath 1031 : imagined worth</p>
<p>Holds in his blood such swoll’n and hot 1032 discourse</p>
<p>That ’twixt his mental and his active parts</p>
<p>Kingdomed Achilles 1033 in commotion 1034 rages</p>
<p>And batters gainst itself. What should I say?</p>
<p>He is so plaguy 1035 proud that the death-tokens 1036 of it</p>
<p>Cry ‘No recovery.’</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Let Ajax go to him.—</p>
<p>Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent;</p>
<p>’Tis said he holds 1037 you well, and will be led</p>
<p>At your request a little from himself 1038 .</p>
<p>ULYSSES O Agamemnon, let it not be so!</p>
<p>We’ll consecrate 1039 the steps that Ajax makes</p>
<p>When they go from 1040 Achilles. Shall the proud lord</p>
<p>That bastes his arrogance with his own seam 1041</p>
<p>And never suffers 1042 matter of the world</p>
<p>Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve</p>
<p>And ruminate himself 1043 : shall he be worshipped</p>
<p>Of that we hold an idol more than he 1044 ?</p>
<p>No, this thrice-worthy and right valiant lord</p>
<p>Must not so stale 1045 his palm 1046 , nobly acquired,</p>
<p>Nor by my will assubjugate 1047 his merit,</p>
<p>As amply titled as Achilles is 1048 , by going to Achilles:</p>
<p>That were 1049 to enlard 1050 his fat-already 1051 pride</p>
<p>And add more coals to Cancer when he burns</p>
<p>With entertaining great Hyperion 1052 .</p>
<p>This lord go to him? Jupiter forbid,</p>
<p>And say in thunder ‘Achilles go to him.’</p>
<p>NESTOR O, this is well: he rubs the vein of him 1053 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>DIOMEDES And how his silence drinks up this applause!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>AJAX If I go to him, with my armèd 1054 fist</p>
<p>I’ll pash 1055 him o’er the face.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON O, no, you shall not go.</p>
<p>AJAX An a 1056 be proud 1057 with me, I’ll pheeze 1058 his pride.</p>
<p>Let me go to him.</p>
<p>ULYSSES Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel 1059 .</p>
<p>AJAX A paltry, insolent fellow!</p>
<p>NESTOR How he describes himself!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>AJAX Can he not be sociable?</p>
<p>ULYSSES The raven chides blackness 1060 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>AJAX I’ll let his humours blood 1061 .</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON He will be the physician that should be the patient.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>AJAX An 1062 all men were o’my mind—</p>
<p>ULYSSES Wit would be out of fashion.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>AJAX A 1063 should not bear it 1064 so, a should eat swords 1065
first: shall pride carry it 1066 ?</p>
<p>NESTOR An ’twould 1067 , you’d carry half 1068 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>ULYSSES A would have ten shares 1069 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>AJAX I will knead 1070 him: I’ll make him supple.</p>
<p>NESTOR He’s not yet through 1071 warm. Force 1072 him with praises:
pour in, pour in, his ambition is dry 1073 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>ULYSSES My lord, you feed too much on this dislike 1074 .</p>
<p>To Agamemnon</p>
<p>NESTOR Our noble general, do not do so.</p>
<p>DIOMEDES You must prepare to fight without Achilles.</p>
<p>ULYSSES Why, ’tis this naming of him 1075 doth him harm.</p>
<p>Here is a man 1076 — but ’tis before his face:</p>
<p>I will be silent.</p>
<p>NESTOR Wherefore should you so?</p>
<p>He is not emulous 1077 , as Achilles is.</p>
<p>ULYSSES Know the whole world 1078 , he is as valiant.</p>
<p>AJAX A whoreson dog, that shall palter 1079 thus with us!</p>
<p>Would he were a Trojan!</p>
<p>NESTOR What a vice were it in Ajax now—</p>
<p>ULYSSES If he were proud—</p>
<p>DIOMEDES Or covetous of praise—</p>
<p>ULYSSES Ay, or surly borne 1080 —</p>
<p>DIOMEDES Or strange 1081 , or self-affected 1082 !</p>
<p>ULYSSES Thank the heavens, lord 1083 , thou art of sweet composure
1084 :</p>
<p>Praise him that got 1085 thee, she that gave thee suck 1086 :</p>
<p>Fame 1087 be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature</p>
<p>Thrice famed beyond, beyond all erudition 1088 :</p>
<p>But he that disciplined 1089 thy arms to fight,</p>
<p>Let Mars divide eternity 1090 in twain 1091 ,</p>
<p>And give him half, and for thy vigour,</p>
<p>Bull-bearing Milo 1092 his addition 1093 yield</p>
<p>To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,</p>
<p>Which, like a bourn 1094 , a pale 1095 , a shore 1096 , confines
1097</p>
<p>Thy spacious and dilated parts 1098 . Here’s Nestor —</p>
<p>Instructed by the antiquary 1099 times —</p>
<p>He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:</p>
<p>Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days</p>
<p>As green 1100 as Ajax’ and your brain so tempered 1101 ,</p>
<p>You should not have the eminence of 1102 him,</p>
<p>But be as Ajax.</p>
<p>AJAX Shall I call you father?</p>
<p>ULYSSES Ay, my good son.</p>
<p>DIOMEDES Be ruled 1103 by him, Lord Ajax.</p>
<p>ULYSSES There is no tarrying 1104 here: the hart 1105 Achilles</p>
<p>Keeps 1106 thicket. Please it our general</p>
<p>To call together all his state 1107 of war.</p>
<p>Fresh kings are come to Troy; tomorrow</p>
<p>We must with all our main of power 1108 stand fast.</p>
<p>And here’s a lord— come knights from east to west,</p>
<p>And cull their flower 1109 , Ajax shall cope 1110 the best.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:</p>
