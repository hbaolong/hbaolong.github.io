15</h4>
<p>Enter the King, Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, Earl of
Westmorland, Sir Walter Blunt and Falstaff</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV How bloodily the sun begins to peer</p>
<p>Above yon busky 1618 hill! The day looks pale</p>
<p>At his distemperature 1619 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY The southern wind</p>
<p>Doth play the trumpet 1620 to his purposes,</p>
<p>And by his hollow whistling in the leaves</p>
<p>Foretells a tempest and a blust’ring day.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Then with the losers let it sympathize,</p>
<p>For nothing can seem foul 1621 to those that win.</p>
<p>The trumpet sounds</p>
<p>Enter Worcester [and Vernon ]</p>
<p>How now, my lord of Worcester? ’Tis not well</p>
<p>That you and I should meet upon such terms</p>
<p>As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,</p>
<p>And made us doff 1622 our easy 1623 robes of peace,</p>
<p>To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel 1624 :</p>
<p>This is not well, my lord, this is not well.</p>
<p>What say you to it? Will you again unknit 1625</p>
<p>This churlish 1626 knot of all-abhorrèd war?</p>
<p>And move in that obedient orb 1627 again</p>
<p>Where you did give a fair and natural light,</p>
<p>And be no more an exhaled meteor 1628 ,</p>
<p>A prodigy 1629 of fear and a portent</p>
<p>Of broachèd 1630 mischief 1631 to the unborn times 1632 ?</p>
<p>WORCESTER Hear me, my liege:</p>
<p>For mine own part, I could be well content</p>
<p>To entertain 1633 the lag-end 1634 of my life</p>
<p>With quiet hours, for I do protest,</p>
<p>I have not sought the day of this dislike 1635 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV You have not sought it? How comes it, then?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Peace, chewet 1636 , peace!</p>
<p>WORCESTER It pleased your majesty to turn your looks</p>
<p>Of favour from myself and all our house;</p>
<p>And yet I must remember 1637 you, my lord,</p>
<p>We were the first and dearest of your friends.</p>
<p>For you my staff of office 1638 did I break</p>
<p>In Richard’s time, and posted 1639 day and night</p>
<p>To meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,</p>
<p>When yet you were in place and in account</p>
<p>Nothing 1640 so strong and fortunate as I.</p>
<p>It was myself, my brother and his son,</p>
<p>That brought 1641 you home and boldly did outdare 1642</p>
<p>The danger of the time. You swore to us,</p>
<p>And you did swear that oath at Doncaster 1643 ,</p>
<p>That you did nothing of purpose gainst the state 1644 ,</p>
<p>Nor claim no further than your new-fall’n right 1645 ,</p>
<p>The seat 1646 of Gaunt 1647 , dukedom of Lancaster.</p>
<p>To this we swore our aid. But in short space</p>
<p>It rained down fortune show’ring on your head,</p>
<p>And such a flood of greatness fell on you —</p>
<p>What with our help, what with the absent king,</p>
<p>What with the injuries 1648 of wanton 1649 time,</p>
<p>The seeming sufferances 1650 that you had borne,</p>
<p>And the contrarious 1651 winds that held the king</p>
<p>So long in the unlucky 1652 Irish wars</p>
<p>That all in England did repute 1653 him dead —</p>
<p>And from this swarm of fair advantages</p>
<p>You took occasion 1654 to be quickly wooed 1655</p>
<p>To gripe 1656 the general sway 1657 into your hand,</p>
<p>Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster,</p>
<p>And being fed by us, you used us so</p>
<p>As that ungentle gull 1658 , the cuckoo’s bird,</p>
<p>Useth the sparrow 1659 , did oppress our nest,</p>
<p>Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk</p>
<p>That even our love 1660 durst not 1661 come near your sight</p>
<p>For fear of swallowing 1662 . But with nimble wing</p>
<p>We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly</p>
<p>Out of your sight and raise this present head,</p>
<p>Whereby we stand opposèd by such means 1663</p>
<p>As you yourself have forged against yourself</p>
<p>By unkind 1664 usage, dangerous countenance,</p>
<p>And violation of all faith and troth 1665</p>
<p>Sworn to us in your younger 1666 enterprise.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV These things indeed you have articulated,</p>
<p>Proclaimed at market-crosses, read in churches,</p>
<p>To face 1667 the garment of rebellion</p>
<p>With some fine colour 1668 that may please the eye</p>
<p>Of fickle changelings 1669 and poor discontents 1670 ,</p>
<p>Which gape and rub the elbow 1671 at the news</p>
<p>Of hurly-burly 1672 innovation 1673 :</p>
<p>And never yet did insurrection want 1674</p>
<p>Such water-colours 1675 to impaint 1676 his cause,</p>
<p>Nor moody 1677 beggars, starving for a time</p>
<p>Of pell-mell havoc 1678 and confusion.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY In both our 1679 armies there is many a soul</p>
<p>Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,</p>
<p>If once they join in trial 1680 . Tell your nephew,</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world</p>
<p>In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes 1681 —</p>
<p>This present enterprise set off his head 1682 —</p>
<p>I do not think a braver 1683 gentleman,</p>
<p>More active-valiant or more valiant-young,</p>
<p>More daring or more bold, is now alive</p>
<p>To grace this latter 1684 age with noble deeds.</p>
<p>For my part, I may speak it to my shame,</p>
<p>I have a truant been to chivalry,</p>
<p>And so I hear he doth account me too.</p>
<p>Yet this 1685 before my father’s majesty:</p>
<p>I am content that he shall take the odds 1686</p>
<p>Of his great name and estimation 1687 ,</p>
<p>And will, to save the blood on either side,</p>
<p>Try fortune with him in a single fight.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture 1688 thee,</p>
<p>Albeit 1689 considerations infinite</p>
<p>Do make 1690 against it. No, good Worcester, no,</p>
<p>We love our people well; even those we love</p>
<p>That are misled upon your cousin’s 1691 part.</p>
<p>And, will they take the offer of our grace 1692 ,</p>
<p>Both he and they and you, yea, every man</p>
<p>Shall be my friend again and I’ll be his.</p>
<p>So tell your cousin, and bring me word</p>
<p>What he will do. But if he will not yield,</p>
<p>Rebuke 1693 and dread correction 1694 wait on us 1695</p>
<p>And they shall do their office 1696 . So, be gone,</p>
<p>We will not now be troubled with reply.</p>
<p>We offer fair 1697 , take it advisedly 1698 .</p>
<p>Exeunt Worcester [and Vernon ]</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY It will not be accepted, on my life.</p>
<p>The Douglas and the Hotspur both together</p>
<p>Are confident against the world in arms.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge 1699 ,</p>
<p>For on their answer 1700 will we set on them;</p>
<p>And God befriend us as our cause is just!</p>
<p>Exeunt all but Prince and Falstaff</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride 1701 me,
so 1702 ; ’tis a point of friendship.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Nothing but a colossus 1703 can do thee that friendship.
Say thy prayers, and farewell.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I would it were bedtime, Hal, and all well.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Why, thou ow’st heaven a death 1704 .</p>
<p>[Exit Prince Henry ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF ‘Tis not due yet. I would be loath to pay him before his
day. What need I be so forward 1705 with him that calls not on me? Well,
’tis no matter, honour pricks 1706 me on. But how if honour prick me off
1707 when I come on? How then? Can honour set to a leg 1708 ? No. Or an
arm? No. Or take away the grief 1709 of a wound? No. Honour hath no
skill in surgery, then? No. What is honour? A word. What is that word
’honour’? Air. A trim 1710 reckoning! Who hath it? He that died
o’Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No. Is it insensible
1711 , then? Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the living?
No. Why? Detraction 1712 will not suffer it. Therefore I’ll none of it.
Honour is a mere scutcheon 1713 : and so ends my catechism 1714 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
