continues</h4>
<p>Enter Posthumus and a Briton Lord</p>
<p>LORD Cam’st thou from where they made the stand?</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS I did.</p>
<p>Though you, it seems, come from the fliers 1652 .</p>
<p>LORD I did.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS No blame be to you, sir, for all was lost,</p>
<p>But 1653 that the heavens fought: the king himself</p>
<p>Of his wings 1654 destitute, the army broken,</p>
<p>And but 1655 the backs of Britons seen, all flying</p>
<p>Through a strait 1656 lane: the enemy full-hearted 1657 ,</p>
<p>Lolling the tongue 1658 with slaught’ring, having work</p>
<p>More plentiful than tools to do’t, struck down</p>
<p>Some mortally 1659 , some slightly touched 1660 , some falling</p>
<p>Merely through fear, that the strait pass was dammed 1661</p>
<p>With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living</p>
<p>To die with lengthened 1662 shame.</p>
<p>LORD Where was this lane?</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Close by the battle, ditched and walled with turf,</p>
<p>Which gave advantage to an ancient 1663 soldier,</p>
<p>An honest one, I warrant, who deserved</p>
<p>So long a breeding as his white beard came to 1664</p>
<p>In doing this for’s country. Athwart the lane,</p>
<p>He, with two striplings 1665 — lads more like to run</p>
<p>The country base 1666 than to commit such slaughter,</p>
<p>With faces fit for masks 1667 , or rather fairer</p>
<p>Than those for preservation cased, or shame —</p>
<p>Made good 1668 the passage, cried to those that fled,</p>
<p>’Our Britain’s harts 1669 die flying, not our men:</p>
<p>To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards 1670 . Stand,</p>
<p>Or we are Romans, and will give you that 1671</p>
<p>Like beasts 1672 which you shun beastly 1673 , and may save</p>
<p>But to look back in frown 1674 : stand, stand.’ These three,</p>
<p>Three thousand confident, in act as many 1675 —</p>
<p>For three performers are the file 1676 when all</p>
<p>The rest do nothing — with this word ‘Stand, stand’,</p>
<p>Accommodated 1677 by the place, more charming 1678</p>
<p>With their own nobleness, which could have turned</p>
<p>A distaff 1679 to a lance, gilded pale looks 1680 ;</p>
<p>Part 1681 shame, part spirit renewed, that some, turned coward</p>
<p>But by example 1682 — O, a sin in war,</p>
<p>Damned in the first beginners! — ’gan to look</p>
<p>The way that they did 1683 , and to grin 1684 like lions</p>
<p>Upon the pikes o’th’hunters 1685 . Then began</p>
<p>A stop i’th’chaser 1686 ; a retire 1687 : anon 1688</p>
<p>A rout, confusion thick: forthwith they fly</p>
<p>Chickens the way which they stooped eagles 1689 : slaves,</p>
<p>The strides they victors made 1690 : and now our cowards,</p>
<p>Like fragments in hard voyages, became</p>
<p>The life o’th’need 1691 : having found the back door open</p>
<p>Of the unguarded hearts 1692 , heavens, how they wound!</p>
<p>Some slain before, some dying, some their friends</p>
<p>O’erborne i’th’former wave 1693 , ten chased by one,</p>
<p>Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty 1694 :</p>
<p>Those that would die or ere resist 1695 are grown 1696</p>
<p>The mortal bugs 1697 o’th’field 1698 .</p>
<p>LORD This was strange chance:</p>
<p>A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Nay, do not wonder at it 1699 : you are made</p>
<p>Rather to wonder at the things you hear</p>
<p>Than to work any 1700 . Will you rhyme upon’t 1701 ,</p>
<p>And vent 1702 it for a mock’ry 1703 ? Here is one:</p>
<p>’Two boys, an old man — twice a boy 1704 — a lane,</p>
<p>Preserved the Britons, was the Romans’ bane 1705 .’</p>
<p>LORD Nay, be not angry, sir.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS ’Lack, to what end 1706 ?</p>
<p>Who dares not stand 1707 his foe, I’ll be his friend:</p>
<p>For if he’ll do as he is made 1708 to do,</p>
<p>I know he’ll quickly fly my friendship 1709 too.</p>
<p>You have put me into rhyme.</p>
<p>LORD Farewell, you’re angry.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Still going 1710 ? This is a lord! O noble misery 1711
,</p>
<p>To be i’th’field and ask ‘What news?’ of me.</p>
<p>Today how many would have given their honours 1712</p>
<p>To have saved their carcasses? Took heel to do’t 1713 ,</p>
<p>And yet died too 1714 . I, in mine own woe charmed 1715 ,</p>
<p>Could not find death where I did hear him groan,</p>
<p>Nor feel him where he struck. Being an ugly monster,</p>
<p>’Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,</p>
<p>Sweet words, or hath more ministers 1716 than we</p>
<p>That draw his knives i’th’war. Well, I will find him:</p>
<p>For being now a favourer to the Briton 1717 ,</p>
<p>No more a Briton, I have resumed again</p>
<p>The part 1718 I came in. Fight I will no more,</p>
<p>But yield me to the veriest 1719 hind 1720 that shall</p>
<p>Once touch my shoulder 1721 . Great the slaughter is</p>
<p>Here made 1722 by th’Roman 1723 ; great the answer 1724 be 1725</p>
<p>Britons must take. For me, my ransom’s death,</p>
<p>On either side 1726 I come to spend 1727 my breath,</p>
<p>Which neither here I’ll keep 1728 nor bear again 1729 ,</p>
<p>But end it by some means for Innogen.</p>
<p>Enter two Captains and Soldiers</p>
<p>FIRST CAPTAIN Great Jupiter be praised, Lucius is taken.</p>
<p>’Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.</p>
<p>SECOND CAPTAIN There was a fourth man, in a silly habit 1730 ,</p>
<p>That gave th’affront 1731 with them.</p>
<p>FIRST CAPTAIN So ’tis reported:</p>
<p>But none of ’em can be found. Stand, who’s there?</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS A Roman,</p>
<p>Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds 1732</p>
<p>Had answered 1733 him.</p>
<p>SECOND CAPTAIN Lay hands on him: a dog,</p>
<p>A leg of Rome shall not return 1734 to tell</p>
<p>What crows have pecked them here: he brags his service</p>
<p>As if he were of note 1735 : bring him to th’king.</p>
<p>Enter Cymbeline, Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus, Pisanio and Roman
Captives [with Jailers]. The Captains present Posthumus to Cymbeline,
who delivers him over to a Jailer</p>
<p>[Exeunt all but Posthumus and two Jailers]</p>
<p>FIRST JAILER You shall not now be stol’n, you have locks upon
you;</p>
<p>So graze as you find pasture 1736 .</p>
<p>SECOND JAILER Ay, or a stomach 1737 .</p>
<p>[Exeunt Jailers]</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Most welcome bondage, for thou art a way,</p>
<p>I think, to liberty: yet am I better</p>
<p>Than one that’s sick o’th’gout, since he had rather</p>
<p>Groan so in perpetuity 1738 than be cured</p>
<p>By th’sure physician, death, who is the key</p>
<p>T’unbar 1739 these locks. My conscience, thou art fettered</p>
<p>More than my shanks 1740 and wrists: you good gods give me</p>
<p>The penitent instrument to pick that bolt 1741 ,</p>
<p>Then free for ever 1742 . Is’t enough I am sorry?</p>
<p>So children temporal 1743 fathers do appease;</p>
<p>Gods are more full of mercy. Must 1744 I repent,</p>
<p>I cannot do it better than in gyves 1745 ,</p>
<p>Desired more than constrained 1746 : to satisfy 1747 ,</p>
<p>If of my freedom ’tis the main part 1748 , take</p>
<p>No stricter render 1749 of me than my all.</p>
<p>I know you are more clement 1750 than vile men 1751 ,</p>
<p>Who of 1752 their broken debtors 1753 take a third,</p>
<p>A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again</p>
<p>On their abatement 1754 : that’s not my desire.</p>
<p>For Innogen’s dear life take mine, and though</p>
<p>’Tis not so dear, yet ’tis a life; you coined 1755 it.</p>
<p>’Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp 1756 :</p>
<p>Though light 1757 , take pieces 1758 for the figure’s sake 1759 .</p>
<p>You rather mine, being yours 1760 : and so, great powers,</p>
<p>If you will take this audit 1761 , take this life,</p>
<p>And cancel these cold bonds 1762 . O Innogen,</p>
<p>I’ll speak to thee in silence.</p>
<p>Sleeps</p>
<p>Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition, Sicilius Leonatus, father
to Posthumus, an old man, attired like a warrior, leading in his hand an
ancient matron, his wife and mother to Posthumus, with music before
them. Then, after other music, follows the two young Leonati, brothers
to Posthumus, with wounds as they died in the wars. They circle
Posthumus round as he lies sleeping</p>
<p>SICILIUS No more, thou thunder-master 1763 , show</p>
<p>Thy spite on mortal flies 1764 :</p>
<p>With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,</p>
<p>That 1765 thy adulteries</p>
<p>Rates 1766 and revenges.</p>
<p>Hath my poor boy done aught 1767 but well,</p>
<p>Whose face I never saw?</p>
<p>I died whilst in the womb he stayed</p>
<p>Attending nature’s law 1768 ,</p>
<p>Whose father then — as men report</p>
<p>Thou orphans’ father art —</p>
<p>Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him</p>
<p>From this earth-vexing smart 1769 .</p>
<p>MOTHER Lucina 1770 lent not me her aid,</p>
<p>But took 1771 me in my throes 1772 ,</p>
<p>That 1773 from me was Posthumus ripped 1774 ,</p>
<p>Came crying ’mongst his foes,</p>
<p>A thing of pity.</p>
<p>SICILIUS Great nature, like his ancestry,</p>
<p>Moulded the stuff 1775 so fair,</p>
<p>That he deserved the praise o’th’world,</p>
<p>As great Sicilius’ heir.</p>
<p>FIRST BROTHER When once 1776 he was mature for man 1777 ,</p>
<p>In Britain where was he</p>
<p>That could stand up his parallel,</p>
<p>Or fruitful 1778 object be</p>
<p>In eye of Innogen, that best</p>
<p>Could deem his dignity 1779 ?</p>
<p>MOTHER With marriage wherefore 1780 was he mocked,</p>
<p>To be exiled, and thrown</p>
<p>From Leonati seat 1781 , and cast</p>
<p>From her his dearest one,</p>
<p>Sweet Innogen?</p>
<p>SICILIUS Why did you suffer 1782 Iachimo,</p>
<p>Slight 1783 thing of Italy,</p>
<p>To taint 1784 his nobler heart and brain</p>
<p>With needless jealousy,</p>
<p>And to become the geck 1785 and scorn</p>
<p>O’th’other’s villainy?</p>
<p>SECOND BROTHER For this from stiller seats 1786 we came,</p>
<p>Our parents and us twain,</p>
<p>That striking in our country’s cause</p>
<p>Fell bravely and were slain,</p>
<p>Our fealty 1787 and Tenantius’ right 1788</p>
<p>With honour to maintain.</p>
<p>FIRST BROTHER Like hardiment 1789 Posthumus hath</p>
<p>To Cymbeline performed:</p>
<p>Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,</p>
<p>Why hast thou thus adjourned 1790</p>
<p>The graces 1791 for his merits due,</p>
<p>Being all to dolours 1792 turned?</p>
<p>SICILIUS Thy crystal 1793 window ope 1794 , look out,</p>
<p>No longer exercise</p>
<p>Upon a valiant race 1795 thy harsh</p>
<p>And potent injuries.</p>
<p>MOTHER Since, Jupiter, our son is good,</p>
<p>Take off his miseries.</p>
<p>SICILIUS Peep through thy marble mansion 1796 , help,</p>
<p>Or we poor ghosts will cry</p>
<p>To th’shining synod of the rest 1797</p>
<p>Against thy deity.</p>
<p>BROTHERS Help, Jupiter, or we appeal 1798 ,</p>
<p>And from thy justice fly.</p>
<p>Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he
throws a thunderbolt. The Ghosts fall on their knees</p>
<p>JUPITER No more you petty spirits of region low 1799</p>
<p>Offend our hearing: hush! How dare you ghosts</p>
<p>Accuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,</p>
<p>Sky-planted 1800 , batters all rebelling coasts?</p>
<p>Poor shadows of Elysium 1801 , hence, and rest</p>
<p>Upon your never-withering banks of flowers.</p>
<p>Be not with mortal accidents 1802 oppressed,</p>
<p>No care of yours it is, you know ’tis ours.</p>
<p>Whom best I love, I cross, to make my gift</p>
<p>The more delayed, delighted 1803 . Be content,</p>
<p>Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:</p>
<p>His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent 1804 .</p>
<p>Our jovial star 1805 reigned at his birth, and in</p>
<p>Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.</p>
<p>He shall be lord of Lady Innogen,</p>
<p>And happier much by his affliction made.</p>
<p>This tablet 1806 lay upon his breast, wherein</p>
<p>Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine 1807 .</p>
<p>And so away: no further with your din</p>
<p>Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.</p>
<p>Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.</p>
<p>Ascends</p>
<p>SICILIUS He came in thunder, his celestial breath</p>
<p>Was sulphurous 1808 to smell: the holy eagle</p>
<p>Stooped as to foot us 1809 : his ascension is</p>
<p>More sweet 1810 than our blest fields: his royal bird</p>
<p>Prunes 1811 the immortal wing and claws his beak 1812</p>
<p>As when 1813 his god is pleased.</p>
<p>ALL Thanks, Jupiter.</p>
<p>SICILIUS The marble pavement 1814 closes, he is entered</p>
<p>His radiant roof. Away, and to be blest,</p>
<p>Let us with care perform his great behest 1815 .</p>
<p>[The Ghosts] vanish</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot</p>
<p>Wakes</p>
<p>A father to me: and thou hast created</p>
<p>A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn 1816 ,</p>
<p>Gone! They went hence so 1817 soon as they were born:</p>
<p>And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend</p>
<p>On greatness’ favour 1818 dream as I have done,</p>
<p>Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve 1819 :</p>
<p>Many dream not to find, neither deserve 1820 ,</p>
<p>And yet are steeped in favours; so am I,</p>
<p>That have this golden chance and know not why.</p>
<p>What fairies haunt this ground? A book 1821 ? O rare 1822 one,</p>
<p>Be not, as is our fangled 1823 world, a garment</p>
<p>Nobler than that it covers. Let thy effects 1824</p>
<p>So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,</p>
<p>As good 1825 as promise.</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>’Whenas 1826 a lion’s whelp 1827 shall, to himself unknown, without
seeking find, and be embraced by a piece 1828 of tender air 1829 : and
when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches, which being dead
many years, shall after revive, be jointed 1830 to the old stock 1831 ,
and freshly grow, then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be</p>
<p>fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.’</p>
<p>’Tis still a dream, or else such stuff 1832 as madmen</p>
<p>Tongue, and brain not 1833 : either both 1834 or nothing,</p>
<p>Or senseless speaking, or a speaking such</p>
<p>As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,</p>
<p>The action of my life is like it, which 1835 I’ll keep,</p>
<p>If but for sympathy.</p>
<p>Enter Jailer</p>
<p>JAILER Come, sir, are you ready for death?</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Over-roasted rather: ready long ago.</p>
<p>JAILER Hanging is the word, sir: if you be ready for that, you are
well cooked.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS So, if I prove a good repast to the spectators, the dish
pays the shot 1836 .</p>
<p>JAILER A heavy reckoning 1837 for you, sir. But the comfort is you
shall be called to no more payments, fear no more tavern-bills, which
are as often the sadness of parting as the procuring of mirth: you come
in faint for want of meat, depart reeling with too much drink: sorry
that you have paid 1838 too much, and sorry that you are paid too much:
purse and brain both empty: the brain the heavier for being too light
1839 , the purse too light, being drawn of heaviness 1840 . Of 1841 this
contradiction 1842 you shall now be quit 1843 . O, the charity of a
penny cord 1844 ! It sums up 1845 thousands in a trice 1846 : you have
no true debitor and creditor 1847 but it: of what’s past, is, and to
come, the discharge 1848 : your neck, sir, is pen, book and counters
1849 ; so the acquittance 1850 follows.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS I am merrier to die than thou art to live.</p>
<p>FIRST JAILER Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the toothache: but
a man that were to sleep your sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I
think he would change places with his officer 1851 : for look you, sir,
you know not which way you shall go.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Yes indeed do I, fellow.</p>
<p>FIRST JAILER Your death 1852 has eyes in’s head then: I have not seen
him so pictured 1853 : you must either be directed by some that take
upon them 1854 to know, or to take upon yourself that which I am sure
you do not know, or jump the after-inquiry 1855 on your own peril: and
how you shall speed 1856 in your journey’s end, I think you’ll never
return to tell on 1857 .</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS I tell thee, fellow, there are none want 1858 eyes to
direct them the way I am going, but such as wink 1859 and will not use
them.</p>
<p>FIRST JAILER What an infinite mock 1860 is this, that a man should
have the best use of eyes to see the way of blindness! I am sure
hanging’s the way of winking 1861 .</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER Knock off his manacles, bring your prisoner to the
king.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Thou bring’st good news, I am called to be made free.</p>
<p>FIRST JAILER I’ll be hanged then.</p>
<p>POSTHUMUS Thou shalt be then freer than a jailer: no bolts 1862 for
the dead.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Posthumus and Messenger]</p>
<p>FIRST JAILER Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young
gibbets, I never saw one so prone 1863 : yet on my conscience, there are
verier 1864 knaves desire to live, for all 1865 he be a Roman: and there
be some of them too that die against their wills; so should I, if I were
one. I would we were all of one mind, and one mind good: O, there were
desolation 1866 of jailers and gallowses! I speak against my present
profit 1867 , but my wish hath a preferment 1868 in’t.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
