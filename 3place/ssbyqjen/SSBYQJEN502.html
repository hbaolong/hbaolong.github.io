<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-6">Scene 2 / running scene 6</h4>
<p>Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, with others</p>
<p>KING Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.</p>
<p>Moreover that 535 we much did long to see you,</p>
<p>The need we have to use you did provoke</p>
<p>Our hasty sending. Something have you heard</p>
<p>Of Hamlet’s transformation, so I call it,</p>
<p>Since not th’exterior nor the inward man</p>
<p>Resembles that it was. What it should be,</p>
<p>More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him</p>
<p>So much from th’understanding of himself,</p>
<p>I cannot deem 536 of. I entreat you both,</p>
<p>That, being of so young days brought up with him,</p>
<p>And since so neighboured to 537 his youth and humour 538 ,</p>
<p>That you vouchsafe your rest 539 here in our court</p>
<p>Some little time, so by your companies</p>
<p>To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather</p>
<p>So much as from occasions 540 you may glean,</p>
<p>Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,</p>
<p>That, opened 541 , lies within our remedy.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Good gentlemen, he hath much talked of you,</p>
<p>And sure I am two men there are not living</p>
<p>To whom he more adheres 542 . If it will please you</p>
<p>To show us so much gentry 543 and good will</p>
<p>As to expend your time with us awhile,</p>
<p>For the supply and profit 544 of our hope,</p>
<p>Your visitation shall receive such thanks</p>
<p>As fits a king’s remembrance.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Both your majesties</p>
<p>Might, by the sovereign power you have of 545 us,</p>
<p>Put your dread pleasures 546 more into command</p>
<p>Than to entreaty.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN We both obey,</p>
<p>And here give up ourselves in the full bent 547</p>
<p>To lay our services freely at your feet,</p>
<p>To be commanded.</p>
<p>KING Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.</p>
<p>And I beseech you instantly to visit</p>
<p>My too much changèd son.— Go, some of ye,</p>
<p>And bring the gentlemen where Hamlet is.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN Heavens make our presence and our practices 548</p>
<p>Pleasant and helpful to him.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Ros. and Guild. with some Attendants]</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Amen.</p>
<p>Enter Polonius</p>
<p>POLONIUS Th’ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,</p>
<p>Are joyfully returned.</p>
<p>KING Thou still 549 hast been the father of good news.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Have I, my lord? I assure you, my good liege,</p>
<p>I hold 550 my duty, as I hold my soul,</p>
<p>Both to my God and to my gracious king:</p>
<p>And I do think, or else this brain of mine</p>
<p>Hunts not the trail of policy 551 so sure</p>
<p>As I have used to do, that I have found</p>
<p>The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.</p>
<p>KING O, speak of that: that I do long to hear.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Give first admittance to th’ambassadors:</p>
<p>My news shall be the fruit 552 to that great feast.</p>
<p>KING Thyself do grace 553 to them and bring them in.—</p>
<p>[Exit Polonius]</p>
<p>He tells me, my sweet queen, that he hath found</p>
<p>The head and source of all your son’s distemper 554 .</p>
<p>GERTRUDE I doubt 555 it is no other but the main 556 :</p>
<p>His father’s death and our o’erhasty marriage.</p>
<p>Enter Polonius, Voltemand and Cornelius</p>
<p>KING Well, we shall sift him 557 .— Welcome, good friends.</p>
<p>Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?</p>
<p>VOLTEMAND Most fair return of greetings and desires 558 .</p>
<p>Upon our first 559 , he sent out to suppress</p>
<p>His nephew’s levies, which to him appeared</p>
<p>To be a preparation gainst the Polack 560 ,</p>
<p>But, better looked into, he truly found</p>
<p>It was against your highness: whereat grieved</p>
<p>That so his sickness, age and impotence 561</p>
<p>Was falsely borne in hand 562 , sends out arrests 563</p>
<p>On Fortinbras, which he, in brief, obeys,</p>
<p>Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine 564</p>
<p>Makes vow before his uncle never more</p>
<p>To give th’assay of arms 565 against your majesty.</p>
<p>Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,</p>
<p>Gives him three thousand crowns 566 in annual fee</p>
<p>And his commission 567 to employ those soldiers,</p>
<p>So levied as before, against the Polack,</p>
<p>With an entreaty, herein further shown,</p>
<p>Gives a paper</p>
<p>That it might please you to give quiet pass 568</p>
<p>Through your dominions for his enterprise</p>
<p>On such regards of safety and allowance 569</p>
<p>As therein are set down.</p>
<p>KING It likes 570 us well,</p>
<p>And at our more considered time 571 we’ll read,</p>
<p>Answer and think upon this business.</p>
<p>Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.</p>
<p>Go to your rest: at night we’ll feast together.</p>
<p>Most welcome home!</p>
<p>Exeunt Ambassadors</p>
<p>POLONIUS This business is very well ended.</p>
<p>My liege, and madam, to expostulate 572</p>
<p>What majesty should be, what duty is,</p>
<p>Why day is day, night night, and time is time,</p>
<p>Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.</p>
<p>Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit 573 ,</p>
<p>And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,</p>
<p>I will be brief: your noble son is mad:</p>
<p>Mad call I it, for, to define true madness,</p>
<p>What is’t but to be nothing else but mad 574 ?</p>
<p>But let that go—</p>
<p>GERTRUDE More matter, with less art.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Madam, I swear I use no art at all.</p>
<p>That he is mad, ’tis true: ’tis true ’tis pity,</p>
<p>And pity it is true: a foolish figure 575 ,</p>
<p>But farewell it, for I will use no art.</p>
<p>Mad let us grant him, then, and now remains</p>
<p>That we find out the cause 576 of this effect,</p>
<p>Or rather say, the cause of this defect,</p>
<p>For this effect defective comes by cause.</p>
<p>Thus it remains, and the remainder thus 577 . Perpend 578 :</p>
<p>I have a daughter — have whilst she is mine —</p>
<p>Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,</p>
<p>Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise 579 .</p>
<p>Shows a letter</p>
<p>The letter</p>
<p>‘To the celestial and my soul’s idol, the most beautified Ophelia’—
That’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase: ‘beautified’ is a vile phrase. But
you shall hear these 580 , ‘in her excellent white bosom’, these—</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Came this from Hamlet to her?</p>
<p>POLONIUS Good madam, stay awhile: I will be faithful 581 .</p>
<p>’Doubt 582 thou the stars are fire,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>Doubt that the sun doth move,</p>
<p>Doubt truth to be a liar,</p>
<p>But never doubt I love.</p>
<p>O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers 583 : I have not art to
reckon my groans 584 ; but that I love thee best, O, most best, believe
it. Adieu. Thine evermore, most dear</p>
<p>lady, whilst this machine is to 585 him, Hamlet.’</p>
<p>This in obedience hath my daughter showed me,</p>
<p>And more above 586 , hath his solicitings,</p>
<p>As they fell out 587 by time, by means and place,</p>
<p>All given to mine ear.</p>
<p>KING But how hath she received his love?</p>
<p>POLONIUS What do you think of me?</p>
<p>KING As of a man faithful and honourable.</p>
<p>POLONIUS I would fain 588 prove so. But what might you think,</p>
<p>When I had seen this hot love on the wing —</p>
<p>As I perceived it, I must tell you that,</p>
<p>Before my daughter told me — what might you,</p>
<p>Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,</p>
<p>If I had played the desk or table-book 589 ,</p>
<p>Or given my heart a winking 590 , mute and dumb,</p>
<p>Or looked upon this love with idle sight 591 ?</p>
<p>What might you think? No, I went round 592 to work,</p>
<p>And my young mistress thus I did bespeak 593 :</p>
<p>’Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star 594 :</p>
<p>This must not be.’ And then I precepts 595 gave her</p>
<p>That she should lock herself from his resort 596 ,</p>
<p>Admit no messengers, receive no tokens:</p>
<p>Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,</p>
<p>And he, repulsèd — a short tale to make —</p>
<p>Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,</p>
<p>Thence to a watch 597 , thence into a weakness,</p>
<p>Thence to a lightness 598 , and, by this declension 599</p>
<p>Into the madness whereon now he raves,</p>
<p>And all we wail for.</p>
<p>KING Do you think ’tis this?</p>
<p>To Gertrude</p>
<p>GERTRUDE It may be, very likely.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Hath there been such a time — I’d fain know that —</p>
<p>That I have positively said ‘’Tis so’</p>
<p>When it proved otherwise?</p>
<p>KING Not that I know.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Take this from this, if this be otherwise:</p>
<p>Points to his head and shoulders?</p>
<p>If circumstances 600 lead me, I will find</p>
<p>Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed</p>
<p>Within the centre 601 .</p>
<p>KING How may we try 602 it further?</p>
<p>POLONIUS You know sometimes he walks four hours together</p>
<p>Here in the lobby.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE So he does indeed.</p>
<p>POLONIUS At such a time I’ll loose 603 my daughter to him:</p>
<p>Be you and I behind an arras 604 then:</p>
<p>To the King</p>
<p>Mark the encounter: if he love her not</p>
<p>And be not from his reason fall’n thereon 605 ,</p>
<p>Let me be no assistant for a state 606 ,</p>
<p>But keep a farm and carters 607 .</p>
<p>KING We will try it.</p>
<p>Enter Hamlet reading on a book</p>
<p>GERTRUDE But look where sadly 608 the poor wretch comes reading.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Away, I do beseech you both away:</p>
<p>I’ll board 609 him presently 610 . O, give me leave 611 .—</p>
<p>Exeunt King and Queen</p>
<p>How does my good lord Hamlet?</p>
<p>HAMLET Well, God-a-mercy 612 .</p>
<p>POLONIUS Do you know me, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET Excellent, excellent well: you’re a fishmonger 613 .</p>
<p>POLONIUS Not I, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Then I would you were so honest a man.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Honest, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET Ay, sir: to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
picked out of two thousand.</p>
<p>POLONIUS That’s very true, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good
kissing carrion 614 — Have you a daughter?</p>
<p>POLONIUS I have, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Let her not walk i’th’sun 615 : conception 616 is a blessing,
but not as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to’t.</p>
<p>POLONIUS How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter: yet he
knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. He is far gone, far
gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love, very
near this. I’ll speak to him again.— What do you read, my lord?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>HAMLET Words, words, words.</p>
<p>POLONIUS What is the matter 617 , my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET Between who?</p>
<p>POLONIUS I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Slanders, sir, for the satirical slave says here that old men
have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging 618
thick amber or plum-tree gum 619 and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit, together with weak hams 620 : all which, sir, though I most
powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty 621 to have
it thus set down, for you yourself, sir, should be old 622 as I am, if
like a crab you could go backward.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Though this be madness, yet there is method in’t.— Will you
walk out of the air, my lord?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>HAMLET Into my grave?</p>
<p>POLONIUS Indeed, that is out o’th’air.— How pregnant 623 sometimes
his replies are! A happiness 624 that often madness hits on, which
reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
leave him and suddenly 625 contrive the means of meeting between him and
my daughter.— My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of
you.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>HAMLET You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
willingly part withal 626 : except my life, my life.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Fare you well, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET These tedious old fools.</p>
<p>Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</p>
<p>POLONIUS You go to seek my lord Hamlet; there he is.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ God save you, sir!</p>
<p>To Polonius</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN Mine honoured lord!</p>
<p>[Exit Polonius]</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ My most dear lord!</p>
<p>HAMLET My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? O,
Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ As the indifferent 627 children of the earth.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN Happy 628 , in that we are not over-happy:</p>
<p>On fortune’s cap we are not the very button 629 .</p>
<p>HAMLET Nor the soles of her shoe?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Neither, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours
630 ?</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN Faith, her privates 631 we.</p>
<p>HAMLET In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true: she is a
strumpet 632 . What’s the news?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ None, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.</p>
<p>HAMLET Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me
question more in particular 633 : what have you, my good friends,
deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison
hither?</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN Prison, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET Denmark’s a prison.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Then is the world one.</p>
<p>HAMLET A goodly one, in which there are many confines 634 , wards 635
and dungeons, Denmark being one o’th’worst.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ We think not so, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Why, then, ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Why then, your ambition makes it one: ’tis too narrow for
your mind.</p>
<p>HAMLET O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very substance
of the ambitious 636 is merely the shadow of a dream.</p>
<p>HAMLET A dream itself is but a shadow.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that it is but a shadow’s shadow.</p>
<p>HAMLET Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched
heroes the beggars’ shadows 637 . Shall we to th’court? For, by my fay
638 , I cannot reason.</p>
<p>BOTH We’ll wait upon 639 you.</p>
<p>HAMLET No such matter 640 : I will not sort 641 you with the rest of
my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
dreadfully attended 642 . But, in the beaten way 643 of friendship, what
make you at Elsinore?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.</p>
<p>HAMLET Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you,
and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny 644 . Were
you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation?
Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN What should we say, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET Why, anything, but to the purpose 645 . You were sent for, and
there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties 646
have not craft enough to colour 647 : I know the good king and queen
have sent for you.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ To what end, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET That you must teach me. But let me conjure 648 you, by the
rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy 649 of our youth, by the
obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear 650 a
better proposer 651 could charge 652 you withal, be even 653 and direct
with me whether you were sent for or no?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ What say you?</p>
<p>Aside to Guildenstern?</p>
<p>HAMLET Nay, then, I have an eye of 654 you.— If you love me, hold not
off.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN My lord, we were sent for.</p>
<p>HAMLET I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your
discovery 655 , and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather
656 . I have of late — but wherefore I know not — lost all my mirth,
forgone all custom of exercise 657 ; and indeed it goes so heavily 658
with my disposition that this goodly frame 659 , the earth, seems to me
a sterile promontory 660 , this most excellent canopy, the air, look
you, this brave 661 o’erhanging firmament 662 , this majestical roof
fretted 663 with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than
a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a
man! How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty, in form and moving
how express 664 and admirable, in action how like an angel, in
apprehension 665 how like a god! The beauty of the world, the paragon of
animals — and yet, to me, what is this quintessence 666 of dust? Man
delights not me — no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem
to say so.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.</p>
<p>HAMLET Why did you laugh when I said ‘Man delights not me’?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten
entertainment 667 the players shall receive from you: we coted 668 them
on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.</p>
<p>HAMLET He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty shall
have tribute 669 of me: the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
target 670 : the lover shall not sigh gratis 671 : the humorous 672 man
shall end his part in peace: the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickled o’th’sear 673 674 : and the lady shall say her mind
freely, or the blank verse shall halt 675 for’t. What players are
they?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Even those you were wont 676 to take delight in, the
tragedians of the city.</p>
<p>HAMLET How chances it they travel? Their residence 677 , both in
reputation and profit, was better both ways.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ I think their inhibition 678 comes by the means of the
late innovation 679 .</p>
<p>HAMLET Do they hold the same estimation 680 they did when I was in
the city? Are they so followed?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ No, indeed, they are not.</p>
<p>HAMLET How comes it? Do they grow rusty?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace. But there
is, sir, an eyrie 681 of children, little eyases 682 , that cry out on
the top of question 683 and are most tyrannically 684 clapped for’t:
these are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages 685 — so
they call them — that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills
and dare scarce come thither 686 .</p>
<p>HAMLET What, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they
escoted 687 ? Will they pursue the quality 688 no longer than they can
sing 689 ? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves
to common 690 players — as it is most like 691 , if their means 692 are
no better — their writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against
their own succession 693 ?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Faith, there has been much to-do on both sides, and the
nation holds it no sin to tar 694 them to controversy. There was for a
while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to
cuffs in the question 695 .</p>
<p>HAMLET Is’t possible?</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN O, there has been much throwing about of brains.</p>
<p>HAMLET Do the boys carry it away 696 ?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Ay, that they do, my lord: Hercules and his load 697
too.</p>
<p>HAMLET It is not strange, for mine uncle is King of Denmark, and
those that would make mows 698 at him while my father lived, give
twenty, forty, an hundred ducats 699 a-piece for his picture in little
700 . There is something in this more than natural 701 , if philosophy
702 could find it out.</p>
<p>Flourish 703 for the Players</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN There are the players.</p>
<p>HAMLET Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come: the
appurtenance 704 of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply 705
with you in the garb 706 , lest my extent 707 to the players — which, I
tell you, must show fairly 708 outward—should more appear like
entertainment 709 than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father and
aunt-mother are deceived.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN In what, my dear lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET I am but mad north-north-west 710 : when the wind is southerly
I know a hawk from a handsaw 711 .</p>
<p>Enter Polonius</p>
<p>POLONIUS Well be with you, gentlemen.</p>
<p>HAMLET Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too — at each ear a hearer:
that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swathing-clouts 712
.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Happily 713 he’s the second time come to them, for they
say an old man is twice a child.</p>
<p>HAMLET I will prophesy: he comes to tell me of the players, mark it.—
You say right, sir: for a Monday morning, ’twas so indeed 714 .</p>
<p>POLONIUS My lord, I have news to tell you.</p>
<p>HAMLET My lord, I have news to tell you.</p>
<p>When Roscius 715 , an actor in Rome—</p>
<p>POLONIUS The actors are come hither, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Buzz, buzz! 716</p>
<p>POLONIUS Upon mine honour—</p>
<p>HAMLET Then came each actor on his ass 717 —</p>
<p>POLONIUS The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
history, pastoral, pastorical-comical, historical-pastoral,
tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene
individable 718 , or poem unlimited 719 . Seneca 720 cannot be too heavy
721 , nor Plautus 722 too light. For the law of writ and the liberty 723
, these are the only men.</p>
<p>HAMLET O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
724</p>
<p>POLONIUS What a treasure had he, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET Why,</p>
<p>’One fair daughter and no more,</p>
<p>The which he loved passing well.’ 725</p>
<p>POLONIUS Still on my daughter.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>HAMLET Am I not i’th’right, old Jephthah?</p>
<p>POLONIUS If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
love passing 726 well.</p>
<p>HAMLET Nay, that follows not 727 .</p>
<p>POLONIUS What follows, then, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET Why,</p>
<p>‘As by lot 728 , God wot 729’,</p>
<p>and then, you know,</p>
<p>‘It came to pass, as most like 730 it was’ —</p>
<p>the first row 731 of the pious chanson 732 will show you more, for
look where my abridgements 733 come.—</p>
<p>Enter four or five Players</p>
<p>You’re welcome, masters, welcome all.— I am glad to see thee well.—
Welcome, good friends.— O, my old friend! Thy face is valanced 734 since
I saw thee last: com’st thou to beard 735 me in Denmark?— What, my young
lady and mistress! By’r lady 736 , your ladyship 737 is nearer heaven
than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine 738 . Pray God
your voice, like a piece of uncurrent 739 gold, be not cracked within
the ring 740 . Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t 741 like
French falconers, fly at anything we see. We’ll have a speech straight
742 : come, give us a</p>
<p>taste of your quality 743 : come, a passionate speech.</p>
<p>FIRST PLAYER What speech, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted,
or if it was, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the
million: ‘twas caviar to the general 744 . But it was — as I received
it, and others, whose judgement in such matters cried in the top of 745
mine — an excellent play, well digested 746 in the scenes, set down with
as much modesty 747 as cunning 748 . I remember one said there was no
sallets 749 in the lines to make the matter savoury 750 , nor no matter
in the phrase that might indict 751 the author of affectation, but
called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more
handsome than fine 752 753 . One speech in it I chiefly loved: ’twas
Aeneas’ tale to Dido 754 , and thereabout of it especially where he
speaks of Priam 755 ’s slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin at
this line — let me see, let me see —</p>
<p>‘The rugged 756 Pyrrhus 757 , like th’Hyrcanian beast 758’—</p>
<p>It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus:</p>
<p>’The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable 759 arms,</p>
<p>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</p>
<p>When he lay couchèd 760 in the ominous horse 761 ,</p>
<p>Hath now this dread and black complexion smeared</p>
<p>With heraldry more dismal 762 763 : head to foot</p>
<p>Now is he total gules 764 , horridly tricked 765</p>
<p>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</p>
<p>Baked and impasted 766 with the parching 767 streets</p>
<p>That lend a tyrannous 768 and damnèd light</p>
<p>To their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,</p>
<p>And thus o’er-sizèd 769 with coagulate 770 gore,</p>
<p>With eyes like carbuncles 771 , the hellish Pyrrhus</p>
<p>Old grandsire 772 Priam seeks.’</p>
<p>So, proceed you.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
discretion 773 .</p>
<p>FIRST PLAYER ’Anon 774 he finds him</p>
<p>Striking too short 775 at Greeks: his antique 776 sword,</p>
<p>Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,</p>
<p>Repugnant 777 to command. Unequal matched,</p>
<p>Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide,</p>
<p>But with the whiff and wind 778 of his fell 779 sword</p>
<p>Th’unnervèd 780 father falls. Then senseless 781 Ilium 782 ,</p>
<p>Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</p>
<p>Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</p>
<p>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear 783 , for, lo, his sword,</p>
<p>Which was declining 784 on the milky 785 head</p>
<p>Of reverend Priam, seemed i’th’air to stick:</p>
<p>So as a painted 786 tyrant Pyrrhus stood,</p>
<p>And, like a neutral to his will and matter 787 ,</p>
<p>Did nothing.</p>
<p>But as we often see against 788 some storm</p>
<p>A silence in the heavens, the rack 789 stand still,</p>
<p>The bold winds speechless and the orb 790 below</p>
<p>As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder</p>
<p>Doth rend the region 791 , so, after Pyrrhus’ pause,</p>
<p>Arousèd vengeance sets him new a-work,</p>
<p>And never did the Cyclops 792 ’ hammers fall</p>
<p>On Mars his 793 armours forged for proof eterne 794</p>
<p>With less remorse 795 than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword</p>
<p>Now falls on Priam.</p>
<p>Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods</p>
<p>In general synod 796 take away her power,</p>
<p>Break all the spokes and fellies 797 from her wheel 798 ,</p>
<p>And bowl the round nave 799 down the hill of heaven,</p>
<p>As low as to the fiends!’</p>
<p>POLONIUS This is too long.</p>
<p>HAMLET It shall to th’barber’s, with your beard.— Prithee, say on:
he’s for a jig 800 or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps: say on; come to
Hecuba 801 .</p>
<p>FIRST PLAYER ‘But who 802 , O, who had seen the mobled 803
queen—’</p>
<p>HAMLET ‘The mobled queen.’</p>
<p>POLONIUS That’s good: ‘mobled queen’ is good.</p>
<p>FIRST PLAYER ’Run barefoot up and down, threat’ning the flame</p>
<p>With bisson rheum 804 , a clout 805 about that head</p>
<p>Where late 806 the diadem 807 stood, and for a robe,</p>
<p>About her lank 808 and all o’er-teemèd 809 loins</p>
<p>A blanket, in th’alarm of fear caught up.</p>
<p>Who this had seen 810 , with tongue in venom steeped,</p>
<p>Gainst Fortune’s state 811 would treason have pronounced 812 :</p>
<p>But if the gods themselves did see her then</p>
<p>When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport</p>
<p>In mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs,</p>
<p>The instant burst of clamour that she made —</p>
<p>Unless things mortal move them not at all —</p>
<p>Would have made milch 813 the burning eyes of heaven,</p>
<p>And passion 814 in the gods.’</p>
<p>POLONIUS Look, whe’er 815 he has not turned his colour and has tears
in’s eyes. Pray you no more.</p>
<p>HAMLET ’Tis well: I’ll have thee speak out the rest soon.— Good my
lord, will you see the players well bestowed 816 ? Do ye hear, let them
be well used 817 , for they are the abstracts 818 and brief chronicles
of the time: after your death you were better have a</p>
<p>bad epitaph than their ill report while you lived.</p>
<p>POLONIUS My lord, I will use them according to their desert 819 .</p>
<p>HAMLET God’s bodikins 820 , man, better: use every man after 821 his
desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own honour
and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty 822
. Take them in.</p>
<p>POLONIUS Come, sirs.</p>
<p>Exit Polonius</p>
<p>HAMLET Follow him, friends: we’ll hear a play tomorrow.—</p>
<p>Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play The Murder of Gonzago
?</p>
<p>To a Player</p>
<p>A PLAYER Ay, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET We’ll ha’t 823 tomorrow night. You could, for a need 824 ,
study 825 a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and insert in’t, could ye not?</p>
<p>A PLAYER Ay, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Very well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.—</p>
<p>[Exeunt Players]</p>
<p>My good friends, I’ll leave you till night. You are welcome to
Elsinore.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ Good my lord.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]. Hamlet remains</p>
<p>HAMLET Ay, so, God buy ye.— Now I am alone.</p>
<p>O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</p>
<p>Is it not monstrous that this player here,</p>
<p>But 826 in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</p>
<p>Could force his soul so to his whole conceit 827</p>
<p>That from her 828 working all his visage wanned 829 ,</p>
<p>Tears in his eyes, distraction 830 in’s aspect 831 ,</p>
<p>A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</p>
<p>With forms to his conceit 832 ? And all for nothing!</p>
<p>For Hecuba!</p>
<p>What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,</p>
<p>That he should weep for her? What would he do</p>
<p>Had he the motive 833 and the cue for passion</p>
<p>That I have? He would drown the stage with tears</p>
<p>And cleave the general ear with horrid 834 speech,</p>
<p>Make mad the guilty and appal 835 the free 836 ,</p>
<p>Confound 837 the ignorant 838 and amaze 839 indeed</p>
<p>The very faculty of eyes and ears. Yet I,</p>
<p>A dull and muddy-mettled 840 rascal, peak 841</p>
<p>Like John-a-dreams 842 , unpregnant of 843 my cause,</p>
<p>And can say nothing: no, not for a king</p>
<p>Upon whose property 844 and most dear life</p>
<p>A damned defeat 845 was made. Am I a coward?</p>
<p>Who calls me villain? Breaks my pate 846 847 across?</p>
<p>Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?</p>
<p>Tweaks me by th’nose? Gives me the lie i’th’throat,</p>
<p>As deep as to the lungs? 848 Who does me this 849 ?</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>Why, I should take it, for it cannot be</p>
<p>But I am pigeon-livered 850 and lack gall</p>
<p>To make oppression bitter, or ere this</p>
<p>I should have fatted all the region kites 851</p>
<p>With this slave’s offal 852 : bloody, bawdy villain!</p>
<p>Remorseless 853 , treacherous, lecherous, kindless 854 villain!</p>
<p>O, vengeance!</p>
<p>Why, what an ass am I! Ay, sure, this is most brave 855 ,</p>
<p>That I, the son of the dear murderèd,</p>
<p>Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,</p>
<p>Must like a whore unpack my heart with words</p>
<p>And fall a-cursing, like a very drab 856 , a scullion 857 !</p>
<p>Fie upon’t, foh! About 858 , my brain! I have heard</p>
<p>That guilty creatures sitting at a play</p>
<p>Have by the very cunning 859 of the scene</p>
<p>Been struck so to the soul that presently 860</p>
<p>They have proclaimed their malefactions 861 :</p>
<p>For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak</p>
<p>With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players</p>
<p>Play something like the murder of my father</p>
<p>Before mine uncle: I’ll observe his looks,</p>
<p>I’ll tent 862 him to the quick: if he but blench 863 ,</p>
<p>I know my course. The spirit that I have seen</p>
<p>May be the devil, and the devil hath power</p>
<p>T’assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps,</p>
<p>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</p>
<p>As he is very potent with such spirits 864 ,</p>
<p>Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds</p>
<p>More relative 865 than this: the play’s the thing</p>
<p>Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
