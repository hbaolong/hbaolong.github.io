id="introduction-to-the-tragedy-of-hamlet-prince-of-denmark">Introduction
to The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark</h4>
<p>The mood of Hamlet is set by its opening exchange: ‘Who’s there?’
‘Nay, answer me.’ The play creates the illusion of asking as many
questions of its audience and interpreters as we may ask of it.
Shakespeare won’t tell us who he is or where he stands. Instead, he
makes us — and our culture — reveal ourselves. That is the source of his
endurance and one of the reasons why Hamlet has long been regarded as
his greatest, or at least his most characteristic, play.</p>
<p>The Prince of Denmark himself is the most famously interrogative of
all dramatic characters. He is Shakespeare’s ultimate man of words. The
actor who plays him has to learn over 340 speeches; the role has a
higher proportion of its play’s words (nearly forty per cent) than any
other in Shakespeare. Hamlet’s favourite intellectual move is to make an
action that he witnesses — a player weeping, a skull tossed from an old
grave — into the occasion for speculation: ‘What’s Hecuba to him, or he
to Hecuba, / That he should weep for her?’, ‘Where be your gibes now,
your gambols, your songs, your flashes of merriment that were wont to
set the table on a roar?’ In watching or reading the play, we are moved,
like Hamlet, to ask the big questions: What should we believe? How
should we act? What happens after death? Whose version of the truth
should we have faith in?</p>
<p>Horatio, the commentator who comes closest to being the voice of the
audience, says that he ‘in part’ believes stories about ghosts and
portents. His qualifier is a watchword for the whole play. Humankind is
in part a god-like creature, full of mental and verbal powers, ‘The
beauty of the world, the paragon of animals.’ But, to take the other
part, we are also ‘quintessence of dust’ — the politician, the lawyer,
the heroic man of action (Alexander the Great) and the humble clown
(Yorick) all end up in the same place.</p>
<p>Like the wood in A Midsummer Night’s Dream , but with tragic as
opposed to comic consequences, Elsinore is a place where ‘everything
seems double’. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are a double act engaged to
spy on Hamlet, with the result that he has ‘at each ear a hearer’.
Hardly anyone in the play seems able to speak without producing a double
epithet: ‘the sensible and true avouch / Of mine own eyes’, ‘the gross
and scope of my opinion’, ‘post-haste and rummage in the land’, ‘the
grace and blush of modesty’, and so on. Stage props also come in pairs:
two contrasting portraits of two brothers, a pair of rapiers (one of
which is sharpened and anointed for the kill), two skulls. Entrances
seem to repeat themselves: the appearances of the ghost; Hamlet
overheard in meditation, first with a book, later with his reflections
on being and not being; the king and Gertrude in their respective
private rooms after the trauma of the Mousetrap play; Ophelia’s two mad
scenes.</p>
<p>The story of a son seeking vengeance for his father’s death is
doubled after Hamlet kills Polonius: ‘by the image of my cause I see /
The portraiture of his’, remarks Hamlet of Laertes. The motif is
redoubled in the figure of Young Fortinbras out to avenge the defeat of
Old Fortinbras. A further commentary is provided by the Player’s speech
about Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, furiously seeking atonement for his
father’s loss by slaughtering old King Priam. But this might be
construed as a negative example: Priam himself is an ‘unnervèd father’
and his slaughter moves a wife and mother, Hecuba, to distraction. If
Hamlet were to become a killing machine like Pyrrhus, he would be
diminishing himself to the inhumanity of his adversary, besides
emotionally destroying his mother: that is his dilemma bounded in a
nutshell.</p>
<p>Hamlet is a student, a model for the perpetual students and idealists
who people later literature, especially in Germany and Russia. Like
Shakespeare’s other highly intellectual drama, Troilus and Cressida,
this is a play that debates the great questions of epistemology, ethics
and metaphysics. ‘Humanism’, the dominant educational theory of the
sixteenth century, proposed that wisdom was to be derived from book
learning. The student developed the arts of language through his
rhetorical training, while collecting the wisdom of the ancients in the
form of citations and sententiae copied into a commonplace book.
Polonius’ maxims on how Laertes should behave when away from home,
climaxing in the cliché ‘to thine own self be true’, are classic
examples. The art of ‘reason’ was refined through the study of ‘common
themes’, one of which was ‘death of fathers’. Reason and judgement were
supposed to prevail over will and passion. The Stoicism of Seneca
provided a model for the use of ‘philosophy’ as protection against the
fickleness of fortune and the vicissitudes of court politics.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s uncle must once have been a good student. He is a master of
balanced rhetoric, the measure and decorum of his verse belying his
crime against the order of nature and state. He thinks he knows, and
that everyone in the court will accept, what is the appropriate length
of time to mourn the death of a brother, husband, father. Hamlet
despises such propriety. He is not interested in the ‘common’ way of
behaving. He speaks for the ‘particular’, the individual. ‘Mourning
duties’, maintained for a set period, are to him mere outward show, the
signs of a ‘seeming’ with which he refuses to play along. He has ‘that
within which passeth show’: the solitary self is set against social
custom. He has returned from university determined to ‘wipe away’ all
the customary wisdom of Stoic decorum, all that ‘discourse of reason’
which humanist theorists regarded as the gift that set men above the
beasts. He will have nothing to do with ‘saws of books’ or the codes of
behaviour that ‘youth and observation’ are supposed to copy from their
humanist texts. After encountering the ghost, he vows to fill his
commonplace book (‘my tables’) from experience instead of books. This
new way of seeing is initially regarded by his fellow-students Horatio
and Marcellus as no more than ‘wild and whirling words’, madness brought
on by an encounter with an evil spirit. But Hamlet knows what he is
doing. He tries on his ‘antic disposition’ as a way of testing the
limits of the rational ‘philosophy’ embodied by Horatio. Ophelia tells
of how she witnessed Hamlet utter a sigh that seemed to ‘end his being’.
That end is also a beginning: the birth of a new man dedicated to the
proposition that the opposite of reason is not madness, but true
feeling. Later, when Ophelia is mad, she is described as ‘Divided from
herself and her fair judgement, / Without the which we are pictures or
mere beasts.’ When Hamlet feigns madness, by contrast, he speaks with
true judgement, as even Polonius half-recognizes: ‘A happiness that
often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously
be delivered of.’</p>
<p>Hamlet is a political drama as well as a play about the journey of an
individual self. It begins with portents betokening ‘some strange
eruption to our state’. It holds up a mirror to a world of royalty,
courtiers, politicians and ambassadors, but also ordinary people:
students, actors, gravediggers, even (on the margins) an underclass of
‘landless resolutes’ following Fortinbras and a ‘rabble’ who want
Laertes to be king. ‘Denmark’s a prison’: Hamlet is cabined, cribbed and
confined by his princely birth, by the machinations of statecraft, and
by the limitations of the material world. In his melancholy, when he
complains that he has lost interest in all gentlemanly pursuits (‘custom
of exercise’), he points to the ‘canopy’ over the stage. The
self-conscious allusion to the architecture of the Globe theatre hints
at how he finds his freedom: in play, first by pretending to be mad,
then through theatre. It is the arrival of the actors that reinvigorates
him. Hamlet loves plays and the players because he recognizes the power
of acting to expose the feigning of public life, the fact that
courtiership and rhetorical decorum are themselves but performances. He
comes to the truth through ‘a fiction’ and ‘a dream of passion’. In this
he can only be regarded as an apologist for the art of his creator.</p>
<p>Hamlet’s shortest soliloquy, after he has been fired up by the
play-within-the-play, is very much in the style of the traditional stage
revenger, such as Hieronimo in Thomas Kyd’s Spanish Tragedy : ‘Now could
I drink hot blood / And do such bitter business as the day / Would quake
to look on.’ Hamlet is as capable of violent action as any other
revenger — witness his cruel rejection of Ophelia and his casual lugging
of Polonius’ guts into the neighbouring room. Nor does he delay nearly
so much as he tells us he is delaying. He has to establish the
authenticity of the ghost, to ensure that it is not a devil sent to
tempt him into evil action, and as soon as he has done this by watching
Claudius’ reaction to the play he goes off to kill him; he doesn’t kill
him at prayer because that would be ‘hire and salary, not revenge’,
would send him to heaven not to hell; he then thinks that he has killed
him in Gertrude’s closet; it turns out that he has killed Polonius
instead and as a result he is packed off to England. As soon as he has
tricked and dispatched Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, effected his daring
escape via the pirate ship and returned to Denmark, he is in a state of
‘readiness’ and the revenge takes place during the duel.</p>
<p>But the style of the ‘hot blood’ soliloquy is completely unlike that
of the other solo speeches, which are all much longer and more
introspective. It is from them that we derive our image of the character
of Hamlet: in the first act, so disgusted by his mother’s hasty
remarriage that he wishes he were dead; in the second, moved to
self-disgust by the way in which the player can work himself into a
frenzy for the fictional sorrows of Hecuba, while he himself has not yet
done anything about his father’s murder; in the third, meditating on the
pros and cons of suicide; and in the Quarto text of the fourth, still
chiding himself when he compares his own inaction with the military
activity of Fortinbras and his army (‘How all occasions do inform
against me / And spur my dull revenge!’). Hamlet’s self-analysis has led
some commentators to wonder whether his failure to kill the praying
usurper might be the result of procrastination, not calculation about
whether he would be sending him to heaven or hell. The soliloquies
present such a convincing picture of irresolution and inaction that even
when it comes to the final scene it may occur to us that the killing of
the king seems to be not so much the climax of Hamlet’s plans as an
incidental consequence of Laertes’ quest for revenge for the deaths of
his father and sister.</p>
<p>For the Romantics such as Goethe and Coleridge, Hamlet was the
archetype of the sensitive man paralysed into inaction by his sheer
capacity for thought — which is to say an image of themselves as poets
uneasily inhabiting the public sphere. Debatable as this reading is,
there can be little doubt that Shakespeare’s innovation in Hamlet was to
take the figure of the revenger from the old play and turn him into an
intellectual, so making revenge into a moral dilemma as opposed to a
practical task to be carried out through effective plotting. Hamlet’s
problem is that his intelligence makes him see both sides of every
question, whereas there is no place for debate and half-measure in the
drama of revenge. The lesson from both the Old Testament and Greek
tragedy, which was mediated to Shakespeare via Seneca’s Latin versions,
was that action requires reactions: a crime in one generation demands
the meting out of punishment in the next, an eye for an eye. Requital
must be exact and complete. Hamlet does not kill the king while he is
praying because that would send him straight to heaven, which does not
correspond to the fate of Old Hamlet, who was murdered ‘grossly, full of
bread, / With all his crimes broad blown.’ It is one of the play’s many
ironies that, immediately on Hamlet’s departure, the king acknowledges
that his prayer for forgiveness is not working — if Hamlet had struck,
he would have damned his enemy.</p>
<p>One of the paradoxes of the play is that the ghost of Old Hamlet
comes from Purgatory, where he is confined in fire ‘Till the foul crimes
done in his days of nature / Are burnt and purged away’, while Hamlet’s
speech giving his reasons for not plunging his sword into his praying
uncle implies that the act of penitence can instantly purge sin away and
allow even a man who has committed the most terrible crime immediate
access to heaven on his death. Purgatory is a Roman Catholic doctrine,
the leap to grace supposed by Hamlet a Protestant one. At several
points, the play engages with the great doctrinal disputes of the
Reformation and Counter-Reformation. Hamlet, after all, longs to be back
at Wittenberg, Martin Luther’s university, intellectual home of the
Protestant revolution, in which authenticity of feeling is paramount and
the key term is ‘conscience’. As Hamlet says at the end of ‘To be, or
not to be’, ‘conscience does make cowards of us all’. In Elizabethan
English, ‘conscience’ means not only moral scruple but also
‘consciousness’. A polyglot dictionary of the period glosses the word as
‘witness of one’s own mind, knowledge, remorse’. It is Hamlet’s extreme
self-consciousness that sets him apart from the traditional revenger.
When alone on stage, reflecting on his own situation, he seems to embody
the very nature of human being ; it is ‘conscience’ in its multiple
senses that forms his self-image, his ‘character’, and in so doing makes
it agonizingly difficult for him to perform the action that is demanded
of him. Yet when he does come to act, he is decisive and ruthless. He
reaches the point of ‘readiness’ when he accepts — never easy for an
intellectual — that what will be will be. Thereafter, he considers it
‘perfect conscience’ to kill the king and has no compunction about his
treatment of the former schoolfellows who have betrayed not only him but
the precious virtue of friendship: Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, he
says, ‘are not near my conscience’.</p>
<p>It is sometimes said that chance, not Hamlet, brings the plot to a
resolution. Hamlet certainly believes that Providence is operating on
his behalf, as witnessed by the good fortune of his having the means to
seal Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’s fate. But the exchange of rapiers
during the fencing match with Laertes is not a matter of chance, as is
sometimes suggested. Many modern productions use the épée that had not
been invented in Shakespeare’s time — a flexible foil that may be
knocked from the hand, leading to the possibility of an accidental
exchange of weapons. But Hamlet and Laertes duel with ‘rapier and
dagger’, the commonest weapons for such an encounter, as illustrated in
Vincentio Saviolo’s treatise on fencing skills, The Art of Practice
(1595). The grip used for the rapier meant that it was very hard to
remove it from the opponent’s hand save by an advanced manoeuvre known
as the ‘left-hand seizure’: Hamlet would have dropped his dagger to the
ground and grabbed the hilt of Laertes’ rapier with his left hand,
twisting it out of his grip; Laertes would have responded with the same
action, resulting in the switch of weapons.</p>
<p>The move, which is illustrated in continental fencing handbooks of
the period, is so skilful that Hamlet’s action must have been
purposeful. He would not initially have seen that Laertes’ rapier was
‘unbated’ (not blunted in the way that was customary to prevent the
injury of gentlemen participating in sporting fights), but on receiving
a ‘hit’ his skin would have been pierced by the point. Realizing that
Laertes is in earnest, not play, he instantly responds with the
manoeuvre that makes the switch. Now he is in deadly earnest himself.
Deeds take over from words, revenge is performed without further
compunctious visitings of nature, and ‘the rest is silence’.</p>
<p>‘Rapier and dagger’: on-guard position, as illustrated in Vincentio
Saviolo’s English fencing treatise of 1595</p>
<p>‘They change rapiers’: disarm and exchange by left-hand seizure, as
illustrated in Henri de Saint-Didier’s French fencing treatise of
1573</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Old Hamlet, King of Denmark, is dead and has been succeeded by
his brother. The new king has also married Gertrude, the widowed queen.
Hamlet, Gertrude’s son, is already distressed by his father’s death and
the hasty remarriage; when his father’s ghost appears to tell him that
he was murdered by his own brother, Hamlet vows revenge. To cover his
intentions, he feigns madness. Polonius, councillor to the court, whose
daughter Ophelia is all but betrothed to Hamlet, believes that his
madness is caused by love. Spied on by Polonius and the king, Hamlet
encounters Ophelia and violently rejects her. A company of actors
arrives and Hamlet asks them to perform a play, hoping that its
similarity to the murder of his own father will force the king to reveal
his guilt. Hamlet’s suspicions are confirmed. He visits his mother,
reviling her for her hasty marriage, and accidentally kills Polonius,
who is hiding in the chamber. The king sends Hamlet to England, planning
to have him murdered. Laertes, Polonius’ son, demands revenge for his
father’s death. His sister, Ophelia, maddened by grief, has drowned.
Hamlet returns and confronts Laertes at her funeral. The king,
meanwhile, has plotted with Laertes to kill Hamlet in a fencing match in
which Laertes will have a poisoned sword. The plot miscarries and
Laertes dies. Gertrude drinks from a poisoned cup intended for Hamlet,
and also dies. Hamlet, wounded by the poisoned sword, kills the king
before he, too, dies. Young Fortinbras of Norway arrives and lays claim
to the throne of Denmark.</p>

<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 75% verse, 25% prose.</p>
<p>DATE: 1600? Not mentioned by Meres in 1598; registered for
publication in summer 1602.Allusions to Julius Caesar (1599) in the
dialogue suggest that it was performed after that play; a reference to
Shakespeare’s Hamlet by the Cambridge academic Gabriel Harvey seems to
date from before February 1601. The exchange concerning boy-actors
alludes to rivalries in the London theatres during 1600 and 1601, but it
may have been inserted in the play some time after its original
composition (the passage is absent from the Second Quarto text). An old
Hamlet play, of unknown authorship and now lost, was extant in the late
1580s to mid-1590s; it is not known whether Shakespeare had any direct
involvement with it.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Given the frequency with which Shakespeare reworked old
plays, it may be assumed that the old Hamlet play was his chief source.
The Danish prince Amleth is a revenger in the twelfth-century Historiae
Danicae of Saxo Grammaticus, familiar to Elizabethan readers via a
retelling in François de Belleforest’s Histoires tragiques (1570). In
Belleforest, the Gertrude figure definitely begins her affair with her
husband’s brother before the murder, in which she is suspected of
complicity. The Player’s speech on the fall of Troy is influenced by the
language of Christopher Marlowe’s Dido Queen of Carthage ; Hamlet’s
philosophizing sometimes resembles the tone of Michel de Montaigne’s
Essais , but a direct link has not been proved.</p>
<p>TEXT: The First Quarto was published in 1603 under the title The
Tragicall Historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke by William Shakespeare.
As it hath beene diuerse times acted by his Highnesse seruants in the
Cittie of London: as also in the two Vniuersities of Cambridge and
Oxford, and elsewhere . Much shorter than the later texts, and with many
garbled lines, it seems to be a reconstruction of an acting version.
There are some notable differences from the later texts (e.g. Polonius
called Corambis, ‘To be or not to be’ and the ‘nunnery’ dialogue
positioned with the ‘fishmonger’ exchange, not after the arrival of the
players), but some of the stage directions are valuable (e.g. ‘Enter
Ofelia playing on a Lute, and her haire downe singing’ for the mad
scene). The Second Quarto, published in 1604/05, was clearly an
‘authorized’ text, intended to displace the First Quarto, as may be seen
from its title-page claim, ‘Newly imprinted and enlarged to almost as
much againe as it was, according to the true and perfect Coppie.’ Most
scholars believe that the text derives from Shakespeare’s manuscript;
over 4000 lines long, it is unlikely to have been staged in full. The
text in the 1623 Folio seems to have been set from the theatre
promptbook or a transcript of it. It has much fuller stage directions
than the Second Quarto, and considerable textual variations: about 70
new lines are present, while about 230 Quarto lines are absent,
including the whole of Hamlet’s last major soliloquy, ‘How all occasions
do inform against me’ — in Folio, he is not there to witness Fortinbras’
army. Hundreds of individual readings differ, strongly suggesting that
the Second Quarto and Folio represent different stages in the play’s
life. Some scholars regard the revision as systematic (e.g. making
subtle changes to Hamlet’s relationship with Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern), but it may have been more incremental and haphazard.
Given the major differences, the editorial practice of conflation, which
began with Nicholas Rowe’s insertion of the Second Quarto’s final
soliloquy in his Folio-based text of 1709, has recently fallen into
