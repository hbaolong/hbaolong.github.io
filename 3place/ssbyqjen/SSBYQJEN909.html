<p>Enter Antiochus, Prince Pericles 38 and Followers</p>
<p>ANTIOCHUS Young Prince of Tyre 39 , you have at large received 40</p>
<p>The danger of the task you undertake?</p>
<p>PERICLES I have, Antiochus, and with a soul</p>
<p>Emboldened with the glory of her praise</p>
<p>Think death no hazard in this enterprise.</p>
<p>ANTIOCHUS Music!</p>
<p>Music plays</p>
<p>Bring in our daughter, clothèd like a bride</p>
<p>For embracements 41 even of Jove 42 himself,</p>
<p>At whose 43 conception, till Lucina 44 reigned 45 ,</p>
<p>Nature this dowry gave: to glad her presence 46</p>
<p>The senate house 47 of planets all did sit,</p>
<p>To knit in her their best perfections 48 .</p>
<p>Enter Antiochus’ Daughter</p>
<p>PERICLES See where she comes, apparelled like the spring 49 ,</p>
<p>Graces her subjects 50 , and her thoughts the king</p>
<p>Of every virtue gives 51 renown 52 to men:</p>
<p>Her face the book of praises 53 , where is read</p>
<p>Nothing but curious 54 pleasures, as 55 from thence</p>
<p>Sorrow were ever razed 56 , and testy 57 wrath</p>
<p>Could never be her mild companion 58 .</p>
<p>You gods that made me man and sway 59 in love,</p>
<p>That have inflamed desire in my breast</p>
<p>To taste the fruit of yon 60 celestial tree 61</p>
<p>Or die in the adventure, be my helps,</p>
<p>As I am son and servant to your will,</p>
<p>To compass 62 such a boundless happiness.</p>
<p>ANTIOCHUS Prince Pericles—</p>
<p>PERICLES That would be son 63 to great Antiochus.</p>
<p>ANTIOCHUS Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,</p>
<p>With golden fruit 64 , but dangerous to be touched,</p>
<p>For deathlike 65 dragons 66 here affright thee hard.</p>
<p>Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view</p>
<p>Her countless 67 glory, which desert 68 must gain,</p>
<p>And which without desert, because thine eye</p>
<p>Presumes to reach 69 , all the whole heap 70 must die.</p>
<p>Yon 71 sometimes 72 famous princes, like thyself</p>
<p>Points to the heads</p>
<p>Drawn by report, adventurous 73 by desire,</p>
<p>Tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance 74 pale</p>
<p>That without covering save yon 75 field of stars</p>
<p>Here they stand, martyrs slain in Cupid’s wars,</p>
<p>And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist</p>
<p>From going on death’s net 76 , whom none resist.</p>
<p>PERICLES Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught</p>
<p>My frail mortality 77 to know itself,</p>
<p>And by those fearful objects 78 to prepare</p>
<p>This body, like to them, to what I must:</p>
<p>For death remembered 79 should be like a mirror</p>
<p>Who tells us life’s but breath 80 , to trust it error.</p>
<p>I’ll make my will, then, and as sick men do</p>
<p>Who know the world, see heaven, but feeling woe</p>
<p>Grip not at earthly joys as erst they did 81 .</p>
<p>So I bequeath a happy peace to you</p>
<p>And all good men, as every prince should do,</p>
<p>My riches to the earth from whence they came,—</p>
<p>But my unspotted 82 fire of love to you.—</p>
<p>To Daughter</p>
<p>Thus ready for the way of life or death,</p>
<p>To Antiochus</p>
<p>I wait the sharpest blow.</p>
<p>ANTIOCHUS Scorning advice, read the conclusion 83 then,</p>
<p>Gives Pericles the riddle</p>
<p>Which read and not expounded, ’tis decreed,</p>
<p>As these 84 before thee, thou thyself shalt bleed.</p>
<p>DAUGHTER Of all ’ssayed 85 yet, mayst thou prove prosperous,</p>
<p>To Pericles</p>
<p>Of all ’ssayed yet, I wish thee happiness.</p>
<p>PERICLES Like a bold champion I assume the lists 86 ,</p>
<p>Nor 87 ask advice of any other thought</p>
<p>But faithfulness and courage.</p>
<p>The riddle</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>’I am no viper, yet I feed</p>
<p>On mother’s flesh 88 which did me breed.</p>
<p>I sought a husband, in which labour 89</p>
<p>I found that kindness 90 in a father.</p>
<p>He’s father, son and husband mild,</p>
<p>I mother, wife and yet his child:</p>
<p>How they may be, and yet in two 91 ,</p>
<p>As you will live resolve it you.’</p>
<p>Sharp physic 92 is the last 93 !— But O, you powers</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>That gives heaven countless eyes 94 to view men’s acts,</p>
<p>Why cloud they not their sights 95 perpetually</p>
<p>If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?—</p>
<p>Fair glass of light 96 , I loved you, and could still</p>
<p>To Daughter</p>
<p>Were not this glorious casket 97 stored with ill.</p>
<p>But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt,</p>
<p>For he’s no man on whom perfections wait 98 ,</p>
<p>That knowing sin within will touch the gate 99 100 .</p>
<p>You are a fair viol 101 , and your sense 102 the strings,</p>
<p>Who, fingered to make man his lawful music 103 ,</p>
<p>Would draw heaven down, and all the gods to hearken.</p>
<p>But being played upon 104 before your time,</p>
<p>Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime 105 .</p>
<p>Good sooth 106 ,</p>
<p>Pericles gestures towards the Daughter</p>
<p>I care not for you.</p>
<p>ANTIOCHUS Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life,</p>
<p>For that’s an article 107 within our law</p>
<p>As dangerous as the rest. Your time’s expired:</p>
<p>Either expound now or receive your sentence.</p>
<p>PERICLES Great king,</p>
<p>Few love to hear the sins they love to act,</p>
<p>’Twould braid 108 yourself too near 109 for me to tell it.</p>
<p>Who 110 has a book of all that monarchs do,</p>
<p>He’s more secure to keep it shut than shown.</p>
<p>For vice repeated is like the wandering wind</p>
<p>Blows dust in others’ eyes to spread itself 111 .</p>
<p>And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,</p>
<p>The breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear</p>
<p>To stop the air would hurt them 112 . The blind mole casts</p>
<p>Copped 113 hills towards heaven, to tell 114 the earth is thronged
115</p>
<p>By man’s oppression, and the poor worm 116 doth die for’t.</p>
<p>Kings are earth’s gods: in vice, their law’s their will,</p>
<p>And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?</p>
<p>It is enough you know, and it is fit,</p>
<p>What being more known grows worse, to smother it 117 .</p>
<p>All love the womb that their first being bred,</p>
<p>Then give my tongue like leave 118 to love my head.</p>
<p>ANTIOCHUS Heaven, that I had thy head!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>He has found the meaning,</p>
<p>But I will gloze with 119 him.—</p>
<p>Young prince of Tyre,</p>
<p>To Pericles</p>
<p>Though by the tenor 120 of your strict edict 121 ,</p>
<p>Your exposition 122 misinterpreting,</p>
<p>We might proceed to cancel of 123 your days,</p>
<p>Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree</p>
<p>As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise 124 .</p>
<p>Forty days longer we do respite you,</p>
<p>If by which time our secret be undone 125 ,</p>
<p>This mercy shows we’ll joy 126 in such a son.</p>
<p>And until then your entertain 127 shall be</p>
<p>As doth befit our honour and your worth.</p>
<p>[Exeunt. ] Pericles remains alone</p>
<p>PERICLES How courtesy would seem to 128 cover sin,</p>
<p>When what is done is like an hypocrite,</p>
<p>The which is good in nothing but in sight 129 .</p>
<p>If it be true that I interpret false,</p>
<p>Then were it certain you were not so bad</p>
<p>As with foul incest to abuse your soul:</p>
<p>Where now you’re both a father and a son</p>
<p>By your untimely 130 claspings with your child —</p>
<p>Which pleasures fits a husband, not a father —</p>
<p>And she an eater of her mother’s flesh</p>
<p>By the defiling of her parents’ bed.</p>
<p>And both like serpents are, who though they feed</p>
<p>On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed 131 .</p>
<p>Antioch farewell, for wisdom sees those men 132</p>
<p>Blush not in actions blacker than the night</p>
<p>Will ’schew 133 no course to keep them from the light 134 .</p>
<p>One sin, I know, another doth provoke:</p>
<p>Murder’s as near to lust as flame to smoke.</p>
<p>Poison and treason are the hands of sin —</p>
<p>Ay, and the targets 135 to put off 136 the shame.</p>
<p>Then lest my life be cropped 137 , to keep you clear 138 ,</p>
<p>By flight, I’ll shun the danger which I fear.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Antiochus</p>
<p>ANTIOCHUS He hath found the meaning,</p>
<p>For which we mean to have his head:</p>
<p>He must not live to trumpet forth 139 my infamy,</p>
<p>Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin</p>
<p>In such a loathèd manner.</p>
<p>And therefore instantly this prince must die,</p>
<p>For by his fall my honour must keep high.</p>
<p>Who attends us there?</p>
<p>Enter Thaliard 140</p>
<p>THALIARD Doth your highness call?</p>
<p>ANTIOCHUS Thaliard, you are of our chamber 141 , Thaliard,</p>
<p>And our mind partakes 142 her private actions</p>
<p>To your secrecy, and for your faithfulness</p>
<p>We will advance you, Thaliard.</p>
<p>Behold, here’s poison and here’s gold:</p>
<p>We hate the Prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him.</p>
<p>It fits thee not to ask the reason why:</p>
<p>Because we bid it. Say, is it done?</p>
<p>THALIARD My lord, ’tis done.</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>Running</p>
<p>ANTIOCHUS Enough.—</p>
<p>Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste 143 .</p>
<p>To Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER My lord, Prince Pericles is fled.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>ANTIOCHUS As thou wilt live, fly after, and like an arrow</p>
<p>To Thaliard</p>
<p>Shot from a well experienced archer hits</p>
<p>The mark his eye doth level 144 at,</p>
<p>So thou never return unless thou say</p>
<p>Prince Pericles is dead.</p>
<p>THALIARD My lord, if I can get him within my pistol’s length 145 I’ll
make him sure 146 enough, so farewell to your highness.</p>
<p>ANTIOCHUS Thaliard adieu.— Till Pericles be dead,</p>
<p>[Exit Thaliard ]</p>
<p>My heart can lend no succour to my head 147 .</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
