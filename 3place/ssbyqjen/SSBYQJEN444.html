<h4 id="scene-1-311-running-scene-2">Scene 1 311 / running scene 2</h4>
<p>Enter Brutus in his orchard 312</p>
<p>BRUTUS What, Lucius, ho?—</p>
<p>Calls</p>
<p>I cannot by the progress of the stars</p>
<p>Give guess how near to day.— Lucius, I say!—</p>
<p>I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.—</p>
<p>When 313 , Lucius, when? Awake, I say: what, Lucius!</p>
<p>Enter Lucius</p>
<p>LUCIUS Called you, my lord?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Get me a taper 314 in my study, Lucius,</p>
<p>When it is lighted, come and call me here.</p>
<p>LUCIUS I will, my lord.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>BRUTUS It must be by his 315 death: and for my part,</p>
<p>I know no personal cause to spurn 316 at him</p>
<p>But for the general 317 . He would be crowned:</p>
<p>How that might change his nature, there’s the question.</p>
<p>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,</p>
<p>And that craves 318 wary walking: crown him that 319 ,</p>
<p>And then I grant we put a sting in him,</p>
<p>That at his will he may do danger with.</p>
<p>Th’abuse of greatness is when it disjoins</p>
<p>Remorse 320 from power: and to speak truth of Caesar,</p>
<p>I have not known when his affections 321 swayed 322</p>
<p>More than his reason. But ’tis a common proof 323</p>
<p>That lowliness 324 is young ambition’s ladder 325</p>
<p>Whereto the climber upward turns his face.</p>
<p>But when he once attains the upmost round 326 ,</p>
<p>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</p>
<p>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees 327</p>
<p>By which he did ascend: so Caesar may;</p>
<p>Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel</p>
<p>Will bear no colour 328 for the thing he is 329 ,</p>
<p>Fashion 330 it thus: that what he is, augmented 331 ,</p>
<p>Would run to these and these extremities:</p>
<p>And therefore think him as a serpent’s egg</p>
<p>Which hatched, would as his kind 332 grow mischievous 333 ,</p>
<p>And kill him in the shell.</p>
<p>Enter Lucius</p>
<p>LUCIUS The taper burneth in your closet 334 , sir.</p>
<p>Searching the window for a flint, I found</p>
<p>This paper, thus sealed up, and I am sure</p>
<p>It did not lie there when I went to bed.</p>
<p>Gives him the letter</p>
<p>BRUTUS Get you to bed again, it is not day.</p>
<p>Is not tomorrow, boy, the first of March?</p>
<p>LUCIUS I know not, sir.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Look in the calendar, and bring me word.</p>
<p>LUCIUS I will, sir.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>BRUTUS The exhalations 335 whizzing in the air</p>
<p>Give so much light that I may read by them.</p>
<p>Opens the letter and reads</p>
<p>’Brutus thou sleep’st. Awake, and see thyself.</p>
<p>Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress.’ —</p>
<p>‘Brutus, thou sleep’st. Awake!’</p>
<p>Such instigations have been often dropped</p>
<p>Where I have took them up.</p>
<p>‘Shall Rome, etc.’ Thus must I piece it out 336 :</p>
<p>Shall Rome stand under one man’s awe? What Rome?</p>
<p>My ancestors did from the streets of Rome</p>
<p>The Tarquin 337 drive when he was called a king.</p>
<p>‘Speak, strike, redress.’ Am I entreated</p>
<p>To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,</p>
<p>If the redress will follow, thou receivest</p>
<p>Thy full petition 338 at the hand of Brutus.</p>
<p>Enter Lucius</p>
<p>LUCIUS Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.</p>
<p>Knock within</p>
<p>BRUTUS ’Tis good. Go to the gate: somebody knocks.—</p>
<p>[Exit Lucius ]</p>
<p>Since Cassius first did whet 339 me against Caesar,</p>
<p>I have not slept.</p>
<p>Between the acting of a dreadful thing</p>
<p>And the first motion 340 , all the interim is</p>
<p>Like a phantasma 341 , or a hideous dream:</p>
<p>The genius 342 and the mortal instruments 343</p>
<p>Are then in council 344 , and the state 345 of man,</p>
<p>Like to a little kingdom, suffers then</p>
<p>The nature of an insurrection 346 .</p>
<p>Enter Lucius</p>
<p>LUCIUS Sir, ’tis your brother 347 Cassius at the door,</p>
<p>Who doth desire to see you.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Is he alone?</p>
<p>LUCIUS No, sir, there are more with him.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Do you know them?</p>
<p>LUCIUS No, sir, their hats are plucked about 348 their ears</p>
<p>And half their faces buried in their cloaks,</p>
<p>That by no means I may discover 349 them</p>
<p>By any mark of favour 350 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS Let ’em enter:—</p>
<p>[Exit Lucius ]</p>
<p>They are the faction. O conspiracy,</p>
<p>Sham’st thou to show thy dang’rous brow by night,</p>
<p>When evils are most free 351 ? O, then, by day</p>
<p>Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough</p>
<p>To mask thy monstrous visage 352 ? Seek none, conspiracy,</p>
<p>Hide it in smiles and affability</p>
<p>For if thou path thy native semblance on 353 ,</p>
<p>Not Erebus 354 itself were dim enough</p>
<p>To hide thee from prevention 355 .</p>
<p>Enter the conspirators: Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus and
Trebonius</p>
<p>CASSIUS I think we are too bold 356 upon your rest:</p>
<p>Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?</p>
<p>BRUTUS I have been up this hour, awake all night.</p>
<p>Know I these men that come along with you?</p>
<p>CASSIUS Yes, every man of them; and no man here</p>
<p>But honours you, and every one doth wish</p>
<p>You had but that opinion of yourself</p>
<p>Which every noble Roman bears of you.</p>
<p>This is Trebonius.</p>
<p>BRUTUS He is welcome hither.</p>
<p>CASSIUS This, Decius Brutus.</p>
<p>BRUTUS He is welcome too.</p>
<p>CASSIUS This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.</p>
<p>BRUTUS They are all welcome.</p>
<p>What watchful cares 357 do interpose themselves</p>
<p>Betwixt your eyes and nigh 358 t?</p>
<p>CASSIUS Shall I entreat a word?</p>
<p>They whisper</p>
<p>DECIUS Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?</p>
<p>CASCA No.</p>
<p>CINNA O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon 359 grey lines</p>
<p>That fret 360 the clouds are messengers of day.</p>
<p>CASCA You shall confess that you are both deceived 361 :</p>
<p>Here, as 362 I point my sword, the sun arises,</p>
<p>Which is a great way growing on 363 the south,</p>
<p>Weighing 364 the youthful season of the year.</p>
<p>Some two months hence, up higher toward the north</p>
<p>He first presents his fire, and the high east</p>
<p>Stands as the Capitol, directly here.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Give me your hands all over 365 , one by one.</p>
<p>Comes forward with Cassius</p>
<p>CASSIUS And let us swear our resolution.</p>
<p>BRUTUS No, not an oath: if not the face of men 366 ,</p>
<p>The sufferance 367 of our souls, the time’s abuse;</p>
<p>If these be motives weak, break off betimes 368 ,</p>
<p>And every man hence to his idle 369 bed.</p>
<p>So let high-sighted 370 tyranny range 371 on</p>
<p>Till each man drop by lottery 372 . But if these —</p>
<p>As I am sure they do — bear fire enough</p>
<p>To kindle cowards, and to steel 373 with valour</p>
<p>The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,</p>
<p>What need we any spur but our own cause</p>
<p>To prick us to redress? What other bond</p>
<p>Than 374 secret 375 Romans that have spoke the word</p>
<p>And will not palter 376 ? And what other oath</p>
<p>Than honesty to honesty engaged 377 ,</p>
<p>That this shall be, or we will fall 378 for it?</p>
<p>Swear 379 priests and cowards, and men cautelous 380 ,</p>
<p>Old feeble carrions 381 , and such suffering souls</p>
<p>That welcome wrongs: unto bad causes swear</p>
<p>Such creatures as men doubt 382 . But do not stain</p>
<p>The even 383 virtue of our enterprise,</p>
<p>Nor th’insuppressive 384 mettle of our spirits,</p>
<p>To think that or 385 our cause or our performance</p>
<p>Did need an oath, when every drop of blood</p>
<p>That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,</p>
<p>Is guilty of a several 386 bastardy 387</p>
<p>If he do break the smallest particle</p>
<p>Of any promise that hath passed from him.</p>
<p>CASSIUS But what of Cicero? Shall we sound 388 him?</p>
<p>I think he will stand very strong with us.</p>
<p>CASCA Let us not leave him out.</p>
<p>CINNA No, by no means.</p>
<p>METELLUS O, let us have him, for his silver hairs 389</p>
<p>Will purchase us a good opinion,</p>
<p>And buy men’s voices to commend our deeds:</p>
<p>It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands.</p>
<p>Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,</p>
<p>But all be buried in his gravity 390 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS O, name him not: let us not break 391 with him,</p>
<p>For he will never follow anything</p>
<p>That other men begin.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Then leave him out.</p>
<p>CASCA Indeed, he is not fit.</p>
<p>DECIUS Shall no man else be touched 392 , but only Caesar?</p>
<p>CASSIUS Decius, well urged.— I think it is not meet 393</p>
<p>Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,</p>
<p>Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him</p>
<p>A shrewd contriver 394 . And you know his means 395</p>
<p>If he improve 396 them may well stretch so far</p>
<p>As to annoy 397 us all: which to prevent,</p>
<p>Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,</p>
<p>To cut the head off and then hack the limbs —</p>
<p>Like wrath in death and envy 398 afterwards —</p>
<p>For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.</p>
<p>Let’s be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.</p>
<p>We all stand up against the spirit 399 of Caesar,</p>
<p>And in the spirit 400 of men there is no blood.</p>
<p>O, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit</p>
<p>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,</p>
<p>Caesar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends,</p>
<p>Let’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully:</p>
<p>Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</p>
<p>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.</p>
<p>And let our hearts, as subtle 401 masters do,</p>
<p>Stir up 402 their servants 403 to an act of rage</p>
<p>And after seem to chide 404 ’em. This shall make</p>
<p>Our purpose 405 necessary, and not envious,</p>
<p>Which so appearing to the common eyes,</p>
<p>We shall be called purgers 406 , not murderers.</p>
<p>And for Mark Antony, think not of him,</p>
<p>For he can do no more than Caesar’s arm</p>
<p>When Caesar’s head is off.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Yet I fear him,</p>
<p>For in the ingrafted 407 love he bears to Caesar —</p>
<p>BRUTUS Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:</p>
<p>If he love Caesar, all that he can do</p>
<p>Is to himself; take thought 408 and die for Caesar.</p>
<p>And that were much he should 409 , for he is given</p>
<p>To sports, to wildness and much company.</p>
<p>TREBONIUS There is no fear 410 in him; let him not die,</p>
<p>For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.</p>
<p>Clock strikes</p>
<p>BRUTUS Peace! Count the clock.</p>
<p>CASSIUS The clock hath stricken three.</p>
<p>TREBONIUS ’Tis time to part.</p>
<p>CASSIUS But it is doubtful yet</p>
<p>Whether Caesar will come forth today or no,</p>
<p>For he is superstitious grown of late,</p>
<p>Quite from the main 411 opinion he held once</p>
<p>Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies 412 .</p>
<p>It may be these apparent 413 prodigies,</p>
<p>The unaccustomed terror of this night</p>
<p>And the persuasion of his augurers 414 ,</p>
<p>May hold him from the Capitol today.</p>
<p>DECIUS Never fear that. If he be so resolved,</p>
<p>I can o’ersway him 415 , for he loves to hear</p>
<p>That unicorns may be betrayed with trees 416 ,</p>
<p>And bears with glasses 417 , elephants with holes 418 ,</p>
<p>Lions with toils 419 and men with flatterers.</p>
<p>But when I tell him he hates flatterers,</p>
<p>He says he does, being then most flattered.</p>
<p>Let me work,</p>
<p>For I can give his humour 420 the true bent 421 ,</p>
<p>And I will bring him to the Capitol.</p>
<p>CASSIUS Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.</p>
<p>BRUTUS By the eighth hour. Is that the uttermost 422 ?</p>
<p>CINNA Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.</p>
<p>METELLUS Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard 423 ,</p>
<p>Who rated 424 him for speaking well of Pompey.</p>
<p>I wonder none of you have thought of him.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Now, good Metellus, go along by 425 him:</p>
<p>He loves me well, and I have given him reasons 426 .</p>
<p>Send him but hither and I’ll fashion him 427 .</p>
<p>CASSIUS The morning comes upon’s 428 : we’ll leave you, Brutus.—</p>
<p>And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember</p>
<p>What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily.</p>
<p>Let not our looks put on 429 our purposes,</p>
<p>But bear it as our Roman actors do,</p>
<p>With untired 430 spirits and formal constancy 431 .</p>
<p>And so good morrow to you every one.—</p>
<p>Exeunt. Brutus remains</p>
<p>Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter.</p>
<p>Calls</p>
<p>Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:</p>
<p>Thou hast no figures, nor no fantasies 432</p>
<p>Which busy 433 care draws in the brains of men;</p>
<p>Therefore thou sleep’st so sound.</p>
<p>Enter Portia</p>
<p>PORTIA Brutus, my lord.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Portia, what mean you 434 ? Wherefore rise you now?</p>
<p>It is not for your health thus to commit</p>
<p>Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.</p>
<p>PORTIA Nor for yours neither. You’ve ungently 435 , Brutus,</p>
<p>Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,</p>
<p>You suddenly arose, and walked about,</p>
<p>Musing, and sighing, with your arms a-cross 436 :</p>
<p>And when I asked you what the matter was,</p>
<p>You stared upon me with ungentle looks.</p>
<p>I urged you further, then you scratched your head,</p>
<p>And too impatiently stamped with your foot:</p>
<p>Yet I insisted, yet you answered not,</p>
<p>But with an angry wafture 437 of your hand</p>
<p>Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did,</p>
<p>Fearing to strengthen that impatience</p>
<p>Which seemed too much enkindled, and withal 438</p>
<p>Hoping it was but an effect of humour 439 ,</p>
<p>Which sometime hath his hour with every man.</p>
<p>It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep;</p>
<p>And could it work so much upon your shape 440</p>
<p>As it hath much prevailed on your condition 441 ,</p>
<p>I should not know 442 you, Brutus. Dear my lord,</p>
<p>Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.</p>
<p>BRUTUS I am not well in health, and that is all.</p>
<p>PORTIA Brutus is wise, and were he not in health,</p>
<p>He would embrace the means to come by it.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.</p>
<p>PORTIA Is Brutus sick? And is it physical</p>
<p>To walk unbracèd 443 , and suck up the humours 444</p>
<p>Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick?</p>
<p>And will he steal out of his wholesome 445 bed</p>
<p>To dare 446 the vile contagion of the night?</p>
<p>And tempt the rheumy 447 and unpurgèd 448 air</p>
<p>To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,</p>
<p>You have some sick offence 449 within your mind</p>
<p>Which by the right and virtue of my place 450</p>
<p>I ought to know of: and upon my knees</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>I charm 451 you, by my once-commended beauty,</p>
<p>By all your vows of love and that great vow 452</p>
<p>Which did incorporate and make us one,</p>
<p>That you unfold 453 to me, your self, your half 454 ,</p>
<p>Why you are heavy 455 , and what men tonight</p>
<p>Have had to resort to 456 you, for here have been</p>
<p>Some six or seven who did hide their faces</p>
<p>Even from darkness.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Kneel not, gentle Portia.</p>
<p>Raises her?</p>
<p>PORTIA I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.</p>
<p>Rises</p>
<p>Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,</p>
<p>Is it excepted 457 I should know no secrets</p>
<p>That appertain to you? Am I your self</p>
<p>But as it were in sort or limitation 458 ?</p>
<p>To keep 459 with you at meals, comfort 460 your bed</p>
<p>And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs 461</p>
<p>Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,</p>
<p>Portia is Brutus’ harlot 462 , not his wife.</p>
<p>BRUTUS You are my true and honourable wife,</p>
<p>As dear to me as are the ruddy drops 463</p>
<p>That visit my sad heart.</p>
<p>PORTIA If this were true, then should I know this secret.</p>
<p>I grant I am a woman; but withal</p>
<p>A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:</p>
<p>I grant I am a woman; but withal</p>
<p>A woman well-reputed, Cato 464 ’s daughter.</p>
<p>Think you I am no stronger than my sex</p>
<p>Being so fathered and so husbanded?</p>
<p>Tell me your counsels 465 , I will not disclose ’em.</p>
<p>I have made strong proof of my constancy 466 ,</p>
<p>Giving myself a voluntary wound</p>
<p>Here in the thigh: can I bear that with patience</p>
<p>And not my husband’s secrets?</p>
<p>BRUTUS O ye gods!</p>
<p>Render me worthy of this noble wife!</p>
<p>Knock</p>
<p>Hark, hark one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,</p>
<p>And by and by 467 thy bosom 468 shall partake</p>
<p>The secrets of my heart.</p>
<p>All my engagements I will construe 469 to thee,</p>
<p>All the charactery 470 of my sad brows:</p>
<p>Leave me with haste.—</p>
<p>Exit Portia</p>
<p>Lucius, who’s that knocks?</p>
<p>Calls</p>
<p>Enter Lucius and Ligarius</p>
<p>Ligarius wears a kerchief 471</p>
<p>LUCIUS Here is a sick man that would speak with you.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.—</p>
<p>Boy, stand aside.— Caius Ligarius, how?</p>
<p>LIGARIUS Vouchsafe 472 good morrow from a feeble tongue.</p>
<p>BRUTUS O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,</p>
<p>To wear a kerchief? Would you were not sick!</p>
<p>LIGARIUS I am not sick if Brutus have in hand</p>
<p>Any exploit worthy the name of honour.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,</p>
<p>Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.</p>
<p>LIGARIUS By all the gods that Romans bow before,</p>
<p>I here discard my sickness. Soul of Rome,</p>
<p>Takes off the kerchief</p>
<p>Brave son, derived from honourable loins,</p>
<p>Thou like an exorcist 473 hast conjured up</p>
<p>My mortified 474 spirit. Now bid me run</p>
<p>And I will strive 475 with things impossible,</p>
<p>Yea, get the better of them. What’s to do?</p>
<p>BRUTUS A piece of work that will make sick men whole 476 .</p>
<p>LIGARIUS But are not some whole that we must make sick?</p>
<p>BRUTUS That must we also. What it is, my Caius,</p>
<p>I shall unfold to thee as we are going</p>
<p>To whom 477 it must be done.</p>
<p>LIGARIUS Set on your foot 478 ,</p>
<p>And with a heart new-fired I follow you,</p>
<p>To do I know not what: but it sufficeth</p>
<p>That Brutus leads me on.</p>
<p>Thunder</p>
<p>BRUTUS Follow me, then.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
