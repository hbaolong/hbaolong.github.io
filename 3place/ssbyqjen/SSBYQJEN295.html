<h4 id="scene-2-604-running-scene-6">Scene 2 604 / running scene 6</h4>
<p>Enter Leontes, Lords, Officers</p>
<p>LEONTES This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,</p>
<p>Even pushes gainst our heart: the party tried</p>
<p>The daughter of a king, our wife, and one</p>
<p>Of 605 us too much beloved. Let us be cleared</p>
<p>Of being tyrannous, since we so openly</p>
<p>Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,</p>
<p>Even to the guilt or the purgation 606 .</p>
<p>Produce the prisoner.</p>
<p>OFFICER It is his highness’ pleasure that the queen</p>
<p>Appear in person here in court. Silence!</p>
<p>[Enter Hermione as to her trial, Paulina and Ladies attending ]</p>
<p>LEONTES Read the indictment.</p>
<p>OFFICER Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes, King of Sicilia, thou
art here accused and arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery
with Polixenes, King of Bohemia, and conspiring with Camillo to take
away the life of our sovereign lord the king, thy royal husband: the
pretence 607 whereof being by circumstances partly laid open, thou,
Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject, didst
counsel 608 and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by
night.</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>HERMIONE Since what I am to say must be but that</p>
<p>Which contradicts my accusation and</p>
<p>The testimony on my part no other</p>
<p>But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot 609 me</p>
<p>To say ‘Not guilty’: mine integrity</p>
<p>Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,</p>
<p>Be so received 610 . But thus: if powers divine</p>
<p>Behold our human actions, as they do,</p>
<p>I doubt not then but innocence shall make</p>
<p>False accusation blush and tyranny</p>
<p>Tremble at patience 611 . You, my lord, best know,</p>
<p>Whom least will seem to do so, my past life</p>
<p>Hath been as continent 612 , as chaste, as true,</p>
<p>As I am now unhappy, which is more</p>
<p>Than history 613 can pattern 614 , though devised</p>
<p>And played to take spectators 615 . For behold me</p>
<p>A fellow of the royal bed, which owe 616</p>
<p>A moiety 617 of the throne, a great king’s daughter,</p>
<p>The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing</p>
<p>To prate 618 and talk for life and honour ’fore</p>
<p>Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it</p>
<p>As I weigh grief, which I would spare 619 : for honour,</p>
<p>’Tis a derivative from me to mine,</p>
<p>And only that I stand for 620 . I appeal</p>
<p>To your own conscience 621 , sir, before Polixenes</p>
<p>Came to your court, how I was in your grace 622 ,</p>
<p>How merited 623 to be so. Since he came,</p>
<p>With what encounter 624 so uncurrent I</p>
<p>Have strained t’appear thus 625 : if one jot beyond</p>
<p>The bound of honour, or in act or will</p>
<p>That way inclining, hardened be the hearts</p>
<p>Of all that hear me, and my near’st of kin</p>
<p>Cry fie 626 upon my grave!</p>
<p>LEONTES I ne’er heard yet</p>
<p>That any of these bolder vices wanted</p>
<p>Less impudence to gainsay what they did</p>
<p>Than to perform it first 627 .</p>
<p>HERMIONE That’s true enough.</p>
<p>Though ’tis a saying, sir, not due to me.</p>
<p>LEONTES You will not own it.</p>
<p>HERMIONE More than mistress of</p>
<p>Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not</p>
<p>At all acknowledge 628 . For Polixenes,</p>
<p>With whom I am accused, I do confess</p>
<p>I loved him, as in honour he required,</p>
<p>With such a kind of love as might become</p>
<p>A lady like me, with a love even such,</p>
<p>So and no other, as yourself commanded:</p>
<p>Which, not to have done, I think had been in me</p>
<p>Both disobedience and ingratitude</p>
<p>To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,</p>
<p>Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely</p>
<p>That it was yours 629 . Now, for 630 conspiracy,</p>
<p>I know not how it tastes, though it be dished 631</p>
<p>For me to try how: all I know of it</p>
<p>Is that Camillo was an honest man.</p>
<p>And why he left your court, the gods themselves —</p>
<p>Wotting 632 no more than I — are ignorant.</p>
<p>LEONTES You knew of his departure, as you know</p>
<p>What you have underta’en to do in’s absence.</p>
<p>HERMIONE Sir,</p>
<p>You speak a language that I understand not:</p>
<p>My life stands in the level of your dreams 633 ,</p>
<p>Which 634 I’ll lay down.</p>
<p>LEONTES Your actions are my dreams.</p>
<p>You had a bastard by Polixenes,</p>
<p>And I but dreamed it. As you were past all shame —</p>
<p>Those of your fact 635 are so — so past all truth,</p>
<p>Which to deny concerns more than avails 636 , for as</p>
<p>Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself 637 ,</p>
<p>No father owning it — which is indeed</p>
<p>More criminal in thee than it — so thou</p>
<p>Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage</p>
<p>Look for no less than death 638 .</p>
<p>HERMIONE Sir, spare your threats.</p>
<p>The bug 639 which you would fright me with, I seek.</p>
<p>To me can life be no commodity 640 ;</p>
<p>The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,</p>
<p>I do give 641 lost, for I do feel it gone,</p>
<p>But know not how it went. My second joy,</p>
<p>And first-fruits of my body, from his presence</p>
<p>I am barred, like one infectious. My third comfort</p>
<p>Starred most unluckily 642 , is from my breast —</p>
<p>The innocent milk in it 643 most innocent mouth —</p>
<p>Haled 644 out to murder. Myself on every post 645</p>
<p>Proclaimed a strumpet 646 , with immodest 647 hatred</p>
<p>The child-bed privilege 648 denied, which ’longs 649</p>
<p>To women of all fashion 650 . Lastly, hurried</p>
<p>Here to this place, i’th’open air, before</p>
<p>I have got strength of limit 651 . Now, my liege,</p>
<p>Tell me what blessings I have here alive,</p>
<p>That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed:</p>
<p>But yet hear this — mistake me not. No life,</p>
<p>I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,</p>
<p>Which I would free 652 — if I shall be condemned</p>
<p>Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else 653</p>
<p>But what your jealousies awake 654 , I tell you</p>
<p>’Tis rigour and not law 655 . Your honours all,</p>
<p>I do refer me to the oracle:</p>
<p>Apollo be my judge!</p>
<p>A LORD This your request</p>
<p>Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,</p>
<p>And in Apollo’s name, his oracle.</p>
<p>[Exeunt some Officers ]</p>
<p>HERMIONE The Emperor of Russia was my father.</p>
<p>O that he were alive, and here beholding</p>
<p>His daughter’s trial! That he did but see</p>
<p>The flatness 656 of my misery; yet with eyes</p>
<p>Of pity, not revenge!</p>
<p>[Enter Officers, with Cleomenes and Dion ]</p>
<p>OFFICER You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,</p>
<p>Holds sword</p>
<p>That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have</p>
<p>Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought</p>
<p>This sealed-up oracle, by the hand delivered</p>
<p>Of great Apollo’s priest; and that since then,</p>
<p>You have not dared to break the holy seal</p>
<p>Nor read the secrets in’t.</p>
<p>CLEOMENES and DION All this we swear.</p>
<p>LEONTES Break up the seals and read.</p>
<p>OFFICER Hermione is chaste, Polixenes blameless, Camillo a true
subject, Leontes a jealous tyrant, his innocent babe truly begotten 657
, and the king shall live without an heir, if that which is lost be not
found.</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>LORDS Now blessèd be the great Apollo!</p>
<p>HERMIONE Praised!</p>
<p>LEONTES Hast thou read truth?</p>
<p>OFFICER Ay, my lord, even so as it is here set down.</p>
<p>LEONTES There is no truth at all i’th’oracle:</p>
<p>The sessions 658 shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.</p>
<p>[Enter a Servant ]</p>
<p>SERVANT My lord the king, the king!</p>
<p>LEONTES What is the business?</p>
<p>SERVANT O sir, I shall be hated to report it!</p>
<p>The prince your son, with mere conceit 659 and fear</p>
<p>Of the queen’s speed 660 , is gone.</p>
<p>LEONTES How? Gone?</p>
<p>SERVANT Is dead.</p>
<p>LEONTES Apollo’s angry, and the heavens themselves</p>
<p>Do strike at my injustice.</p>
<p>Hermione faints</p>
<p>How now there!</p>
<p>PAULINA This news is mortal 661 to the queen. Look down</p>
<p>And see what death is doing.</p>
<p>LEONTES Take her hence.</p>
<p>Her heart is but o’ercharged. She will recover.</p>
<p>I have too much believed mine own suspicion:</p>
<p>Beseech you, tenderly apply to her</p>
<p>Some remedies for life.—</p>
<p>[Exeunt Ladies, carrying Hermione ]</p>
<p>Apollo, pardon</p>
<p>My great profaneness gainst thine oracle!</p>
<p>I’ll reconcile me to Polixenes,</p>
<p>New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,</p>
<p>Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy.</p>
<p>For, being transported 662 by my jealousies</p>
<p>To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose</p>
<p>Camillo for the minister to poison</p>
<p>My friend Polixenes, which had been done,</p>
<p>But that the good mind of Camillo tardied 663</p>
<p>My swift command, though I with death and with</p>
<p>Reward did threaten and encourage him,</p>
<p>Not doing it and being done 664 . He, most humane</p>
<p>And filled with honour, to my kingly guest</p>
<p>Unclasped my practice 665 , quit his fortunes here —</p>
<p>Which you knew great — and to the hazard</p>
<p>Of all incertainties himself commended 666 ,</p>
<p>No richer than 667 his honour. How he glisters 668</p>
<p>Through my rust! And how his piety</p>
<p>Does my deeds make the blacker!</p>
<p>PAULINA Woe the while!</p>
<p>O, cut my lace 669 , lest my heart, cracking it,</p>
<p>Break too.</p>
<p>A LORD What fit is this, good lady?</p>
<p>PAULINA What studied 670 torments, tyrant, hast for me?</p>
<p>What wheels 671 ? Rack 672 s? Fires? What flaying? Boiling?</p>
<p>In leads or oils? What old or newer torture</p>
<p>Must I receive, whose every word deserves</p>
<p>To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny,</p>
<p>Together working with thy jealousies —</p>
<p>Fancies 673 too weak for boys, too green 674 and idle 675</p>
<p>For girls of nine — O, think what they have done</p>
<p>And then run mad indeed, stark mad! For all</p>
<p>Thy bygone fooleries 676 were but spices 677 of it.</p>
<p>That thou betrayed’st Polixenes, ’twas nothing:</p>
<p>That did but show thee, of 678 a fool, inconstant 679</p>
<p>And damnable ingrateful. Nor was’t much,</p>
<p>Thou wouldst have poisoned good Camillo’s honour,</p>
<p>To have him kill a king. Poor trespasses 680 .</p>
<p>More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon</p>
<p>The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter</p>
<p>To be or 681 none or little; though a devil</p>
<p>Would have shed water out of fire ere done’t 682 .</p>
<p>Nor is’t directly laid to thee, the death</p>
<p>Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts —</p>
<p>Thoughts high for one so tender 683 — cleft 684 the heart</p>
<p>That could conceive 685 a gross and foolish sire 686</p>
<p>Blemished his gracious dam: this is not, no,</p>
<p>Laid to thy answer 687 . But the last — O, lords,</p>
<p>When I have said 688 , cry woe! The queen, the queen,</p>
<p>The sweet’st, dear’st creature’s dead, and vengeance for’t</p>
<p>Not dropped down 689 yet.</p>
<p>A LORD The higher powers forbid!</p>
<p>PAULINA I say she’s dead. I’ll swear’t. If word nor oath</p>
<p>Prevail not, go and see. If you can bring</p>
<p>Tincture or lustre 690 in her lip, her eye,</p>
<p>Heat outwardly or breath within, I’ll serve you</p>
<p>As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant,</p>
<p>Do not repent these things, for they are heavier</p>
<p>Than all thy woes can stir 691 : therefore betake thee</p>
<p>To 692 nothing but despair. A thousand knees</p>
<p>Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,</p>
<p>Upon a barren mountain and still 693 winter</p>
<p>In storm perpetual, could not move the gods</p>
<p>To look that way thou wert 694 .</p>
<p>LEONTES Go on, go on.</p>
<p>Thou canst not speak too much. I have deserved</p>
<p>All tongues to talk their bitt’rest.</p>
<p>A LORD Say no more.</p>
<p>Howe’er the business goes, you have made fault</p>
<p>To Paulina</p>
<p>I’th’boldness of your speech 695 .</p>
<p>PAULINA I am sorry for’t;</p>
<p>All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,</p>
<p>I do repent. Alas, I have showed too much</p>
<p>The rashness of a woman. He is touched</p>
<p>To th’noble heart. What’s gone and what’s past help</p>
<p>Should be past grief. Do not receive affliction</p>
<p>At my petition 696 ; I beseech you, rather</p>
<p>Let me be punished, that have minded 697 you</p>
<p>Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege,</p>
<p>Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman.</p>
<p>The love I bore your queen — lo, fool again! —</p>
<p>I’ll speak of her no more, nor of your children.</p>
<p>I’ll not remember 698 you of my own lord,</p>
<p>Who is lost too. Take your patience 699 to you,</p>
<p>And I’ll say nothing.</p>
<p>LEONTES Thou didst speak but well</p>
<p>When most the truth 700 , which I receive much better</p>
<p>Than to be pitied of 701 thee. Prithee bring me</p>
<p>To the dead bodies of my queen and son.</p>
<p>One grave shall be for both: upon them 702 shall</p>
<p>The causes of their death appear, unto</p>
<p>Our shame perpetual. Once a day I’ll visit</p>
<p>The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there</p>
<p>Shall be my recreation. So long as nature</p>
<p>Will bear up with this exercise 703 , so long</p>
<p>I daily vow to use 704 it. Come and lead me</p>
<p>To these sorrows.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
