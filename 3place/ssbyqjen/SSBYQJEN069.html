continues</h4>
<p>Enter Falstaff [disguised as Herne ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF The Windsor bell hath struck twelve, the minute draws on.
Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me! Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull
for thy Europa 1071 . Love set on thy horns. O powerful Love, that in
some respects makes a beast a man, in some other a man a beast. You were
also, Jupiter, a swan for the love of Leda 1072 . O omnipotent Love, how
near the god drew to the complexion of a goose. A fault 1073 done first
in the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And then another fault
in the semblance of a fowl. Think on’t, Jove, a foul fault! When gods
have hot backs 1074 , what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a
Windsor stag, and the fattest, I think, i’th’forest. Send me a cool
rut-time 1075 , Jove, or who can blame me to piss my tallow 1076 ? Who
comes here? My doe 1077 ?</p>
<p>[Enter Mistress Ford and Mistress Page ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Sir John? Art thou there, my deer 1078 ? My male
deer?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My doe with the black scut 1079 ! Let the sky rain potatoes
1080 , let it thunder to the tune of Greensleeves, hail kissing-comfits
1081 and snow eryngoes 1082 . Let there come a tempest of provocation
1083 , I will shelter me here.</p>
<p>Embraces her</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart 1084 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Divide me like a bribed buck 1085 , each a haunch: I will
keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow of this walk 1086 ,
and my horns I bequeath your husbands. Am I a woodman 1087 , ha? Speak I
like Herne the hunter? Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience: he makes
restitution 1088 . As I am a true spirit, welcome.</p>
<p>Horns within</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Alas, what noise?</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Heaven forgive our sins.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What should this be?</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE Away, away!</p>
<p>They run off</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the oil 1089
that’s in me should set hell on fire. He would never else cross 1090 me
thus.</p>
<p>Enter [Evans, disguised as before; Pistol, as Hobgoblin 1091 ;
Mistress Quickly, Anne and others, as ] Fairies [with tapers ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Fairies black, grey, green and white,</p>
<p>You moonshine revellers and shades 1092 of night,</p>
<p>You orphan 1093 heirs of fixèd destiny 1094 ,</p>
<p>Attend your office and your quality 1095 .</p>
<p>Crier 1096 Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyez 1097 .</p>
<p>PISTOL Elves, list 1098 your names. Silence, you airy toys 1099 .</p>
<p>Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap.</p>
<p>Where fires thou find’st unraked 1100 and hearths unswept,</p>
<p>There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry 1101 ,</p>
<p>Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF They are fairies, he that speaks to them shall die.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>I’ll wink 1102 and couch: no man their works must eye 1103 .</p>
<p>Lies down upon his face</p>
<p>EVANS Where’s Bede? Go you, and where you find a maid</p>
<p>That ere she sleep has thrice her prayers said,</p>
<p>Raise up the organs of her fantasy 1104 :</p>
<p>Sleep she 1105 as sound as careless 1106 infancy.</p>
<p>But those as 1107 sleep and think not on their sins,</p>
<p>Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides and shins.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY About 1108 , about.</p>
<p>Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out.</p>
<p>Strew good luck, oafs 1109 , on every sacred room,</p>
<p>That it may stand till the perpetual doom 1110 ,</p>
<p>In state as wholesome as in state ’tis fit 1111 ,</p>
<p>Worthy 1112 the owner and the owner it.</p>
<p>The several chairs of order 1113 look you scour</p>
<p>With juice of balm 1114 and every precious flower.</p>
<p>Each fair instalment 1115 , coat 1116 , and sev’ral crest 1117 ,</p>
<p>With loyal blazon 1118 evermore be blest.</p>
<p>And nightly meadow-fairies, look you sing,</p>
<p>Like to the Garter’s compass 1119 , in a ring.</p>
<p>Th’expressure 1120 that it bears, green let it be,</p>
<p>More fertile-fresh than all the field to see.</p>
<p>And Honi soit qui mal y pense 1121 write</p>
<p>In em’rald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white,</p>
<p>Like sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,</p>
<p>Buckled 1122 below fair knighthood’s bending knee.</p>
<p>Fairies use flowers for their charactery 1123 .</p>
<p>Away, disperse. But till ’tis one o’clock,</p>
<p>Our dance of custom 1124 round about the oak</p>
<p>Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.</p>
<p>EVANS Pray you, lock hand in hand, yourselves in order set.</p>
<p>And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,</p>
<p>To guide our measure 1125 round about the tree.</p>
<p>But stay, I smell a man of middle-earth 1126 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he transform
me to a piece of cheese 1127 !</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>PISTOL Vile worm, thou wast o’erlooked 1128 even in thy birth.</p>
<p>To Falstaff</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY With trial-fire 1129 touch me 1130 his
finger-end.</p>
<p>If he be chaste, the flame will back descend</p>
<p>And turn 1131 him to no pain. But if he start 1132 ,</p>
<p>It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.</p>
<p>PISTOL A trial, come.</p>
<p>EVANS Come, will this wood 1133 take fire?</p>
<p>They burn him with their tapers</p>
<p>FALSTAFF O, O, O!</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire.</p>
<p>About 1134 him, fairies, sing a scornful rhyme,</p>
<p>And, as you trip 1135 , still 1136 pinch him to your time.</p>
<p>FAIRIES [sing ] The Song</p>
<p>Fie on sinful fantasy 1137 ,</p>
<p>Fie on lust and luxury 1138 !</p>
<p>During this song they pinch Falstaff.</p>
<p>Lust is but a bloody fire 1139 ,</p>
<p>Caius comes one way and steals away</p>
<p>Kindled with unchaste desire,</p>
<p>a boy in green; Slender another way and</p>
<p>Fed in heart, whose flames aspire,</p>
<p>takes off a boy in white; and Fenton</p>
<p>As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.</p>
<p>comes and steals away Anne 1140 .</p>
<p>Pinch him, fairies, mutually 1141 ,</p>
<p>A noise of hunting is heard within.</p>
<p>Pinch him for his villainy.</p>
<p>All the Fairies run away.</p>
<p>Pinch him and burn him and turn him about,</p>
<p>Falstaff pulls off his buck’s</p>
<p>Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.</p>
<p>head and rises</p>
<p>[Enter Page, Ford, Mistress Page and Mistress Ford ]</p>
<p>PAGE Nay, do not fly, I think we have watched 1142 you now.</p>
<p>Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn 1143 ?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher 1144 .</p>
<p>Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?</p>
<p>See you these, husband? Do not these fair yokes 1145</p>
<p>Points to horns</p>
<p>Become the forest better than the town?</p>
<p>FORD Now, sir, who’s a cuckold now? Master Broom, Falstaff ’s a
knave, a cuckoldly knave: here are his horns, Master Broom. And, Master
Broom, he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford’s but his buck-basket, his
cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be paid to Master Broom.
His horses are arrested 1146 for it, Master Broom.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Sir John, we have had ill luck, we could never meet
1147 . I will never take you for my love again, but I will always count
you my deer 1148 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.</p>
<p>FORD Ay, and an ox too. Both the proofs 1149 are extant 1150 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF And these are not fairies. I was three or four times in the
thought they were not fairies, and yet the guiltiness of my mind, the
sudden surprise of my powers 1151 , drove the grossness of the foppery
1152 into a received belief, in despite of 1153 the teeth of all rhyme
and reason, that they were fairies. See now how wit 1154 may be made a
Jack-a-Lent 1155 , when ’tis upon ill employment!</p>
<p>EVANS Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your desires, and
fairies will not pinse you.</p>
<p>Unmasks</p>
<p>FORD Well said, fairy Hugh.</p>
<p>EVANS And leave you your jealousies too, I pray you.</p>
<p>FORD I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art able to woo
her in good English.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that it wants
matter 1156 to prevent so gross o’erreaching 1157 as this? Am I ridden
with 1158 a Welsh goat too? Shall I have a coxcomb 1159 of frieze 1160 ?
’Tis time I were choked with a piece of toasted cheese.</p>
<p>EVANS Seese is not good to give putter. Your belly is all putter.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF ‘Seese’ and ‘putter’? Have I lived to stand at the taunt of
one that makes fritters 1161 of English? This is enough to be the decay
of lust and late-walking 1162 through the realm.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have thrust
virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders, and have given
ourselves without scruple to hell, that ever the devil could have made
you our delight?</p>
<p>FORD What, a hodge-pudding 1163 ? A bag of flax 1164 ?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE A puffed 1165 man?</p>
<p>PAGE Old, cold, withered and of intolerable 1166 entrails?</p>
<p>FORD And one that is as slanderous as Satan?</p>
<p>PAGE And as poor as Job 1167 ?</p>
<p>FORD And as wicked as his wife?</p>
<p>EVANS And given to fornications, and to taverns, and sack, and wine,
and metheglins 1168 , and to drinkings, and swearings, and starings 1169
, pribbles and prabbles?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well, I am your theme 1170 . You have the start of 1171 me.
I am dejected 1172 . I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel 1173 .
Ignorance itself is a plummet 1174 o’er me 1175 . Use me as you
will.</p>
<p>FORD Marry, sir, we’ll bring you to Windsor, to one Master Broom,
that you have cozened of money, to whom you should have been a pander
1176 . Over and above that you have suffered, I think to repay that
money will be a biting affliction.</p>
<p>PAGE Yet be cheerful, knight. Thou shalt eat a posset 1177 tonight at
my house, where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife, that now laughs
at thee. Tell her Master Slender hath married her daughter.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Doctors doubt that. If Anne Page be my daughter, she
is, by this 1178 , Doctor Caius’ wife.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>[Enter Slender ]</p>
<p>SLENDER Whoa ho, ho, father Page!</p>
<p>PAGE Son, how now? How now, son, have you dispatched 1179 ?</p>
<p>SLENDER Dispatched? I’ll make the best in Gloucestershire know on’t.
Would I were hanged, la, else.</p>
<p>PAGE Of what 1180 , son?</p>
<p>SLENDER I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page, and she’s
a great lubberly 1181 boy. If it had not been i’th’church, I would have
swinged 1182 him, or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it
had been Anne Page, would I might never stir — and ’tis a postmaster
1183 ’s boy.</p>
<p>PAGE Upon my life, then, you took the wrong 1184 .</p>
<p>SLENDER What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for
a girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman’s apparel,
I would not have had him 1185 .</p>
<p>PAGE Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should
know my daughter by her garments?</p>
<p>SLENDER I went to her in green 1186 , and cried ‘mum’, and she cried
‘budget’, as Anne and I had appointed, and yet it was not Anne, but a
postmaster’s boy.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Good George, be not angry. I knew of your purpose,
turned my daughter into white 1187 , and indeed, she is now with the
Doctor at the deanery, and there married.</p>
<p>[Enter Caius ]</p>
<p>CAIUS Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened. I ha’ married un
garçon , a boy, un paysan 1188 , by gar, a boy. It is not Anne Page. By
gar, I am cozened.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Why, did you take her in white 1189 ?</p>
<p>CAIUS Ay, by gar, and ’tis a boy. By gar, I’ll raise 1190 all
Windsor.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>FORD This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?</p>
<p>PAGE My heart misgives me. Here comes Master Fenton.</p>
<p>[Enter Fenton and Anne ]</p>
<p>How now, Master Fenton?</p>
<p>ANNE Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon.</p>
<p>PAGE Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid?</p>
<p>FENTON You do amaze 1191 her. Hear the truth of it:</p>
<p>You would have married her most shamefully,</p>
<p>Where there was no proportion held in love 1192 .</p>
<p>The truth is, she and I, long since contracted 1193 ,</p>
<p>Are now so sure 1194 that nothing can dissolve us.</p>
<p>Th’offence is holy that she hath committed,</p>
<p>And this deceit loses the name of craft,</p>
<p>Of disobedience, or unduteous title 1195 1196 ,</p>
<p>Since therein she doth evitate 1197 and shun</p>
<p>A thousand irreligious cursèd hours</p>
<p>Which forcèd marriage would have brought upon her.</p>
<p>FORD Stand not amazed, here is no remedy.</p>
<p>To Page and Mistress Page</p>
<p>In love the heavens themselves do guide the state 1198 .</p>
<p>Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I am glad, though you have ta’en a special stand 1199 to</p>
<p>To Page and Mistress Page</p>
<p>strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced 1200 .</p>
<p>PAGE Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!</p>
<p>What cannot be eschewed must be embraced.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Well, I will muse 1201 no further. Master Fenton,</p>
<p>Heaven give you many, many merry days.</p>
<p>Good husband, let us every one go home,</p>
<p>And laugh this sport o’er by a country fire,</p>
<p>Sir John and all.</p>
<p>FORD Let it be so. Sir John,</p>
<p>To Master Broom you yet shall hold your word,</p>
<p>For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.</p>
