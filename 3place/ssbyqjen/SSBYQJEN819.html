20</h4>
<p>Enter York, and his army of Irish, with Drum 1490 and Colours
1491</p>
<p>YORK From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,</p>
<p>And pluck the crown from feeble Henry’s head.</p>
<p>Ring, bells, aloud: burn, bonfires, clear and bright,</p>
<p>To entertain 1492 great England’s lawful king.</p>
<p>Ah, sancta majestas 1493 ! Who would not buy thee dear?</p>
<p>Let them obey that knows not how to rule.</p>
<p>This hand was made to handle naught but gold 1494 .</p>
<p>I cannot give due action to my words,</p>
<p>Except 1495 a sword or sceptre balance it.</p>
<p>A sceptre shall it have, have I 1496 a soul,</p>
<p>On which I’ll toss 1497 the flower-de-luce 1498 of France.</p>
<p>Enter Buckingham</p>
<p>Whom have we here? Buckingham to disturb me?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>The king hath sent him sure: I must dissemble 1499 .</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.</p>
<p>YORK Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.</p>
<p>Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure 1500 ?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,</p>
<p>To know the reason of these arms in peace:</p>
<p>Or why thou, being a subject as I am,</p>
<p>Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,</p>
<p>Should raise so great a power without his leave,</p>
<p>Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.</p>
<p>YORK Scarce can I speak, my choler 1501 is so great.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,</p>
<p>I am so angry at these abject 1502 terms.</p>
<p>And now, like Ajax Telamonius 1503 ,</p>
<p>On sheep or oxen could I spend 1504 my fury.</p>
<p>I am far better born 1505 than is the king:</p>
<p>More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts.</p>
<p>But I must make fair weather 1506 yet a while,</p>
<p>Till Henry be more weak and I more strong.—</p>
<p>Buckingham, I prithee pardon me,</p>
<p>Aloud</p>
<p>That I have given no answer all this while:</p>
<p>My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.</p>
<p>The cause why I have brought this army hither</p>
<p>Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,</p>
<p>Seditious to his grace and to the state.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM That is too much presumption on thy part:</p>
<p>But if thy arms be to no other end,</p>
<p>The king hath yielded unto thy demand:</p>
<p>The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.</p>
<p>YORK Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.</p>
<p>YORK Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.</p>
<p>Soldiers, I thank you all: disperse yourselves:</p>
<p>Meet me tomorrow in St George’s Field 1507 ,</p>
<p>You shall have pay and everything you wish.</p>
<p>And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,</p>
<p>Command 1508 my eldest son, nay, all my sons,</p>
<p>As pledges of my fealty 1509 and love,</p>
<p>I’ll send them all as willing as I live:</p>
<p>Lands, goods, horse, armour, anything I have,</p>
<p>Is his to use, so 1510 Somerset may die.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM York, I commend this kind 1511 submission:</p>
<p>We twain 1512 will go into his highness’ tent.</p>
<p>Enter King [Henry VI ] and Attendants</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,</p>
<p>That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?</p>
<p>YORK In all submission and humility</p>
<p>York doth present himself unto your highness.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?</p>
<p>YORK To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,</p>
<p>And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,</p>
<p>Who since I heard to be discomfited 1513 .</p>
<p>Enter Iden with Cade’s head</p>
<p>IDEN If one so rude and of so mean condition 1514</p>
<p>May pass into the presence of a king,</p>
<p>Lo, I present your grace a traitor’s head,</p>
<p>The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI The head of Cade? Great God, how just art thou!</p>
<p>O, let me view his visage, being dead,</p>
<p>That living wrought 1515 me such exceeding trouble.</p>
<p>Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?</p>
<p>IDEN I was, an’t like 1516 your majesty.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI How art thou called? And what is thy degree 1517 ?</p>
<p>IDEN Alexander Iden, that’s my name:</p>
<p>A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM So please it you, my lord, ’twere not amiss</p>
<p>He were created knight for his good service.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Iden, kneel down.</p>
<p>Iden kneels and is knighted</p>
<p>Rise up a knight.</p>
<p>He rises</p>
<p>We give thee for reward a thousand marks 1518 ,</p>
<p>And will 1519 that thou henceforth attend on us.</p>
<p>IDEN May Iden live to merit such a bounty,</p>
<p>And never live but true unto his liege.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>Enter Queen [Margaret ] and Somerset</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI See, Buckingham, Somerset comes wi’th’queen:</p>
<p>Go bid her hide him quickly from the duke.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,</p>
<p>But boldly stand and front 1520 him to his face.</p>
<p>YORK How now? Is Somerset at liberty?</p>
<p>Then, York, unloose thy long-imprisoned thoughts,</p>
<p>And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.</p>
<p>Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?</p>
<p>False king, why hast thou broken faith with me,</p>
<p>Knowing how hardly 1521 I can brook abuse 1522 ?</p>
<p>King did I call thee? No, thou art not king:</p>
<p>Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,</p>
<p>Which 1523 dar’st not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.</p>
<p>That head of thine doth not become 1524 a crown:</p>
<p>Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer’s 1525 staff,</p>
<p>And not to grace an awful 1526 princely sceptre.</p>
<p>That gold must round engirt 1527 these brows of mine,</p>
<p>Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles’ spear 1528 ,</p>
<p>Is able with the change to kill and cure.</p>
<p>Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up,</p>
<p>And with the same to act 1529 controlling 1530 laws:</p>
<p>Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more</p>
<p>O’er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.</p>
<p>SOMERSET O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,</p>
<p>Of capital 1531 treason gainst the king and crown:</p>
<p>Obey, audacious traitor, kneel for grace.</p>
<p>YORK Wouldst have me kneel? First let me ask of these 1532 ,</p>
<p>If they can brook 1533 I bow a knee to man 1534 .</p>
<p>Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;</p>
<p>[Exit Attendant ]</p>
<p>I know, ere they will have me go to ward 1535 ,</p>
<p>They’ll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement 1536 .</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Call hither Clifford: bid him come amain 1537 ,</p>
<p>To say if that 1538 the bastard boys of York</p>
<p>Shall be the surety for their traitor father.</p>
<p>[Exit Buckingham ]</p>
<p>YORK O blood-bespotted 1539 Neapolitan 1540 ,</p>
<p>Outcast of Naples, England’s bloody scourge 1541 !</p>
<p>The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,</p>
<p>Shall be their father’s bail, and bane 1542 to those</p>
<p>That for my surety will refuse the boys.</p>
<p>Enter Edward and Richard</p>
<p>See where they come: I’ll warrant they’ll make it good.</p>
<p>Enter Clifford [and his son Young Clifford ]</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Health and all happiness to my lord the king.</p>
<p>Kneeling to Henry, then rising</p>
<p>YORK I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with thee?</p>
<p>Nay, do not fright us with an angry look:</p>
<p>We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again:</p>
<p>For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD This is my king, York, I do not mistake:</p>
<p>But thou mistakes me much to think I do:</p>
<p>To Bedlam 1543 with him! Is the man grown mad?</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Ay, Clifford, a bedlam 1544 and ambitious humour
1545</p>
<p>Makes him oppose himself against his king.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD He is a traitor: let him to 1546 the Tower,</p>
<p>And chop away that factious pate 1547 of his.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET He is arrested, but will not obey:</p>
<p>His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.</p>
<p>YORK Will you not, sons?</p>
<p>EDWARD Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.</p>
<p>RICHARD And if words will not, then our weapons shall.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Why, what a brood of traitors have we here?</p>
<p>YORK Look in a glass 1548 , and call thy image so.</p>
<p>I am thy king, and thou a false-heart 1549 traitor:</p>
<p>Call hither to the stake my two brave bears 1550 ,</p>
<p>That with the very shaking of their chains</p>
<p>They may astonish 1551 these fell-lurking curs 1552 :</p>
<p>Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.</p>
<p>Enter the Earls of Warwick and Salisbury</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Are these thy bears? We’ll bait thy bears to death,</p>
<p>And manacle the bearherd 1553 in their chains,</p>
<p>If thou dar’st bring them to the baiting place 1554 .</p>
<p>RICHARD Oft have I seen a hot o’erweening 1555 cur</p>
<p>Run back and bite 1556 , because he was withheld:</p>
<p>Who, being suffered 1557 with the bear’s fell 1558 paw,</p>
<p>Hath clapped his tail between his legs and cried:</p>
<p>And such a piece of service 1559 will you do,</p>
<p>If you oppose yourselves 1560 to match 1561 Lord Warwick.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump 1562 ,</p>
<p>As crooked in thy manners as thy shape 1563 !</p>
<p>YORK Nay, we shall heat you 1564 thoroughly anon.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?</p>
<p>Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,</p>
<p>Thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son!</p>
<p>What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,</p>
<p>And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles 1565 ?</p>
<p>O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?</p>
<p>If it be banished from the frosty 1566 head,</p>
<p>Where shall it find a harbour 1567 in the earth?</p>
<p>Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,</p>
<p>And shame thine honourable age with blood?</p>
<p>Why art thou old and want’st experience,</p>
<p>Or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it?</p>
<p>For shame in duty bend thy knee to me,</p>
<p>That bows unto the grave with mickle 1568 age.</p>
<p>SALISBURY My lord, I have considered with myself</p>
<p>The title of this most renownèd duke,</p>
<p>And in my conscience do repute 1569 his grace</p>
<p>The rightful heir to England’s royal seat.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?</p>
<p>SALISBURY I have.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Canst thou dispense with 1570 heaven for such an
oath?</p>
<p>SALISBURY It is great sin to swear unto a sin:</p>
<p>But greater sin to keep a sinful oath:</p>
<p>Who can be bound by any solemn vow</p>
<p>To do a murd’rous deed, to rob a man,</p>
<p>To force a spotless virgin’s chastity,</p>
<p>To reave 1571 the orphan of his patrimony,</p>
<p>To wring 1572 the widow from her customed right 1573 ,</p>
<p>And have no other reason for this wrong</p>
<p>But that he was bound by a solemn oath?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET A subtle 1574 traitor needs no sophister 1575 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.</p>
<p>YORK Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,</p>
<p>I am resolved for death or dignity 1576 .</p>
<p>CLIFFORD The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.</p>
<p>WARWICK You were best to go to bed and dream again,</p>
<p>To keep thee from the tempest of the field 1577 .</p>
<p>CLIFFORD I am resolved to bear a greater storm</p>
<p>Than any thou canst conjure up today:</p>
<p>And that I’ll write upon thy burgonet 1578 ,</p>
<p>Might I but know 1579 thee by thy household badge 1580 .</p>
<p>WARWICK Now by my father’s 1581 badge, old Neville’s crest,</p>
<p>The rampant 1582 bear chained to the ragged 1583 staff,</p>
<p>This day I’ll wear aloft 1584 my burgonet 1585 ,</p>
<p>As on a mountain top the cedar shows 1586</p>
<p>That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,</p>
<p>Even to affright thee with the view thereof.</p>
<p>CLIFFORD And from thy burgonet I’ll rend 1587 thy bear</p>
<p>And tread it under foot with all contempt,</p>
<p>Despite the bearherd that protects the bear.</p>
<p>YOUNG CLIFFORD And so to arms, victorious father,</p>
<p>To quell the rebels and their complices 1588 .</p>
<p>RICHARD Fie, charity, for shame! Speak not in spite,</p>
<p>For you shall sup with Jesu Christ tonight.</p>
<p>YOUNG CLIFFORD Foul stigmatic 1589 , that’s more than thou canst
tell.</p>
<p>RICHARD If not in heaven, you’ll surely sup in hell</p>
<p>Exeunt [severally ]</p>
