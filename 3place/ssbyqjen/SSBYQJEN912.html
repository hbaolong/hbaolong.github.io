<h4 id="scene-4-243-running-scene-3">Scene 4 243 / running scene 3</h4>
<p>Enter Cleon the governor of Tarsus, with his wife [Dionyza ] and
others</p>
<p>CLEON My Dionyza, shall we rest us here</p>
<p>And by relating tales of others’ griefs</p>
<p>See if ’twill teach us to forget our own?</p>
<p>DIONYZA That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it.</p>
<p>For who digs 244 hills because they do aspire,</p>
<p>Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.</p>
<p>O, my distressèd lord, even such our griefs are:</p>
<p>Here they are but felt, and seen with mischief’s eyes 245 ,</p>
<p>But like to groves, being topped 246 they higher rise.</p>
<p>CLEON O, Dionyza,</p>
<p>Who wanteth 247 food and will not say he wants it,</p>
<p>Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?</p>
<p>Our tongues our sorrows do sound 248 deep,</p>
<p>Our woes into the air, our eyes to weep</p>
<p>Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them 249 louder,</p>
<p>That if heaven slumber while their creatures want,</p>
<p>They may awake their helpers to comfort them.</p>
<p>I’ll then discourse 250 our woes, felt several years,</p>
<p>And wanting breath to speak 251 , help me with tears.</p>
<p>DIONYZA I’ll do my best, sir.</p>
<p>CLEON This Tarsus, o’er which I have the government,</p>
<p>A city o’er whom plenty held full hand 252 ,</p>
<p>For riches 253 strewed herself even in her streets,</p>
<p>Whose towers bore heads so high they kissed the clouds,</p>
<p>And strangers ne’er beheld, but wondered at 254 .</p>
<p>Whose men and dames so jetted 255 and adorned 256 ,</p>
<p>Like one another’s glass to trim them by 257 ,</p>
<p>Their tables were stored full to glad 258 the sight,</p>
<p>And not so much to feed on as delight.</p>
<p>All poverty was scorned, and pride so great</p>
<p>The name of help grew odious to repeat 259 .</p>
<p>DIONYZA O, ’tis too true.</p>
<p>CLEON But see what heaven can do by this our change 260 .</p>
<p>These mouths who but of late earth, sea and air</p>
<p>Were all too little to content and please,</p>
<p>Although they gave their creatures in abundance,</p>
<p>As houses are defiled for want 261 of use,</p>
<p>They are now starved for want of exercise.</p>
<p>Those palates who, not yet two summers younger 262 ,</p>
<p>Must have inventions 263 to delight the taste</p>
<p>Would now be glad of bread and beg for it.</p>
<p>Those mothers who to nuzzle up 264 their babes</p>
<p>Thought naught too curious 265 , are ready now</p>
<p>To eat those little darlings whom they loved.</p>
<p>So sharp are hunger’s teeth, that man and wife,</p>
<p>Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life 266 .</p>
<p>Here stands a lord, and there a lady, weeping.</p>
<p>Here many sink, yet those which see them fall,</p>
<p>Have scarce strength left to give them burial.</p>
<p>Is not this true?</p>
<p>DIONYZA Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.</p>
<p>CLEON O, let those cities that of plenty’s cup</p>
<p>And her prosperities so largely 267 taste</p>
<p>With their superfluous riots 268 , hear these tears 269 !</p>
<p>The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.</p>
<p>Enter a Lord</p>
<p>LORD Where’s the lord governor?</p>
<p>CLEON Here.</p>
<p>Speak out thy sorrows, which thou bring’st in haste,</p>
<p>For comfort is too far for us to expect.</p>
<p>LORD We have descried 270 upon our neighbouring shore,</p>
<p>A portly 271 sail 272 of ships make hitherward 273 .</p>
<p>CLEON I thought as much.</p>
<p>One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,</p>
<p>That may succeed as his inheritor.</p>
<p>And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,</p>
<p>Taking advantage of our misery,</p>
<p>Hath stuffed the hollow vessels with their power 274 ,</p>
<p>To beat us down, the which are down already,</p>
<p>And make a conquest of unhappy 275 me,</p>
<p>Whereas no glory’s got to overcome 276 .</p>
<p>LORD That’s the least fear 277 , for by the semblance</p>
<p>Of their white flags 278 displayed, they bring us peace,</p>
<p>And come to us as favourers 279 , not as foes.</p>
<p>CLEON Thou speak’st like him’s untutored to repeat 280 :</p>
<p>Who 281 makes the fairest show means most deceit.</p>
<p>But bring they what they will and what they can,</p>
<p>What need we fear?</p>
<p>The ground’s the lowest, and we are halfway there 282 .</p>
<p>Go tell their general we attend him here,</p>
<p>To know from whence he comes and what he craves.</p>
<p>LORD I go, my lord.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>CLEON Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist 283 ,</p>
<p>If wars, we are unable to resist.</p>
<p>Enter Pericles with attendants</p>
<p>PERICLES Lord governor, for so we hear you are,</p>
<p>Let not our ships and number of our men</p>
<p>Be like a beacon 284 fired t’amaze 285 your eyes.</p>
<p>We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,</p>
<p>And seen the desolation of your streets.</p>
<p>Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears 286 ,</p>
<p>But to relieve them of their heavy load,</p>
<p>And these our ships you happily 287 may think</p>
<p>Are like the Trojan horse was stuffed within</p>
<p>With bloody veins expecting overthrow,</p>
<p>Are stored with corn to make your needy bread 288 ,</p>
<p>And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.</p>
<p>ALL TARSIANS The gods of Greece protect you,</p>
<p>They kneel</p>
<p>And we’ll pray for you.</p>
<p>PERICLES Arise, I pray you, rise.</p>
<p>They rise</p>
<p>We do not look for reverence but for love,</p>
<p>And harbourage for ourself, our ships and men.</p>
<p>CLEON The which when any shall not gratify 289 ,</p>
<p>Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought 290 ,</p>
<p>Be it our wives, our children or ourselves,</p>
<p>The curse of heaven and men succeed 291 their evils!</p>
<p>Till when—the which, I hope, shall ne’er be seen—</p>
<p>Your grace is welcome to our town and us.</p>
<p>PERICLES Which welcome we’ll accept, feast here awhile,</p>
<p>Until our stars 292 that frown, lend us a smile.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
<p>Chorus / running scene 4</p>
<p>Enter Gower</p>
<p>GOWER Here have you seen a mighty king</p>
<p>His child, iwis 293 , to incest bring,</p>
<p>A better prince 294 , and benign lord,</p>
<p>That will prove awful 295 both in deed and word. Be</p>
<p>quiet then, as men should be,</p>
<p>Till he hath passed necessity 296 :</p>
<p>I’ll show you those in troubles reign 297 ,</p>
<p>Losing a mite 298 , a mountain gain.</p>
<p>The good 299 in conversation 300 ,</p>
<p>To whom I give my benison 301 ,</p>
<p>Is still at Tarsus, where each man</p>
<p>Thinks all is writ 302 , he speken can 303 ,</p>
<p>And to remember 304 what he does</p>
<p>Build his statue 305 to make him glorious 306 .</p>
<p>But tidings to the contrary 307</p>
<p>Are brought your eyes, what need speak I?</p>
<p>Dumb show 308</p>
<p>Enter at one door Pericles talking with Cleon, all the train 309 with
them. Enter at another door a Gentleman with a letter to Pericles.
Pericles shows the letter to Cleon. Pericles gives the messenger a
reward, and knights him. Exit</p>
<p>Pericles [with his Attendants ] at one door, and Cleon at another
[with his Attendants ]</p>
<p>GOWER Good Helicane 310 that stayed at home</p>
<p>Not to 311 eat honey like a drone</p>
<p>From others’ labours: though he strive</p>
<p>To killen 312 bad, keeps good alive.</p>
<p>And to fulfil his prince’ desire</p>
<p>Sends word of all that haps 313 in Tyre:</p>
<p>How Thaliard came full bent 314 with sin</p>
<p>And had intent to murder him,</p>
<p>And that in Tarsus was not best</p>
<p>Longer for him to make his rest.</p>
<p>He doing so 315 , put forth to seas,</p>
<p>Where when men been 316 there’s seldom ease:</p>
<p>For now the wind begins to blow,</p>
<p>Thunder above and deeps below</p>
<p>Makes such unquiet, that the ship</p>
<p>Should 317 house him safe is wracked and split,</p>
<p>And he, good prince, having all lost,</p>
<p>By waves from coast to coast is tossed.</p>
<p>All perishen 318 of man, of pelf 319 ,</p>
<p>Ne aught escapend 320 but himself.</p>
<p>Till Fortune, tired with doing bad,</p>
<p>Threw him ashore, to give him glad 321 .</p>
<p>And here he comes: what shall be next,</p>
<p>Pardon old Gower, this ’longs 322 the text.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
