<h4 id="scene-3-705-running-scene-7">Scene 3 705 / running scene 7</h4>
<p>Enter Antigonus [carrying the ] babe, [and ] a Mariner</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS Thou art perfect 706 then, our ship hath touched upon</p>
<p>The deserts 707 of Bohemia?</p>
<p>MARINER Ay, my lord, and fear</p>
<p>We have landed in ill time. The skies look grimly</p>
<p>And threaten present blusters 708 . In my conscience 709 ,</p>
<p>The heavens with that we have in hand 710 are angry</p>
<p>And frown upon’s.</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard.</p>
<p>Look to thy bark 711 . I’ll not be long before</p>
<p>I call upon thee.</p>
<p>MARINER Make your best haste, and go not</p>
<p>Too far i’th’land: ’tis like to be loud 712 weather.</p>
<p>Besides, this place is famous for the creatures</p>
<p>Of prey that keep upon’t.</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS Go thou away. I’ll follow instantly.</p>
<p>MARINER I am glad at heart</p>
<p>To be so rid o’th’business 713 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>ANTIGONUS Come, poor babe.</p>
<p>I have heard, but not believed, the spirits o’th’dead</p>
<p>May walk again. If such thing be, thy mother</p>
<p>Appeared to me last night, for ne’er was dream</p>
<p>So like a waking. To me comes a creature 714 ,</p>
<p>Sometimes her head on one side, some another 715 .</p>
<p>I never saw a vessel 716 of like sorrow,</p>
<p>So filled and so becoming 717 . In pure white robes,</p>
<p>Like very sanctity 718 , she did approach</p>
<p>My cabin where I lay, thrice bowed before me,</p>
<p>And, gasping to begin some speech, her eyes</p>
<p>Became two spouts; the fury 719 spent, anon 720</p>
<p>Did this break from her: ’Good Antigonus,</p>
<p>Since fate, against thy better disposition,</p>
<p>Hath made thy person for the thrower-out</p>
<p>Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,</p>
<p>Places remote enough are in Bohemia.</p>
<p>There weep and leave it crying. And, for 721 the babe</p>
<p>Is counted lost forever, Perdita 722 ,</p>
<p>I prithee call’t. For this ungentle 723 business</p>
<p>Put on thee by my lord, thou ne’er shalt see</p>
<p>Thy wife Paulina more.’ And so, with shrieks 724</p>
<p>She melted into air. Affrighted much,</p>
<p>I did in time collect myself and thought</p>
<p>This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys 725 ,</p>
<p>Yet for this once, yea superstitiously,</p>
<p>I will be squared 726 by this. I do believe</p>
<p>Hermione hath suffered death, and that</p>
<p>Apollo would, this being indeed the issue</p>
<p>Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,</p>
<p>Either for life or death, upon the earth</p>
<p>Of its right father. Blossom, speed 727 thee well.</p>
<p>Lays down the baby with a box and bundle</p>
<p>There lie, and there thy character 728 : there these 729 ,</p>
<p>Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,</p>
<p>And still rest thine 730 . The storm begins. Poor wretch,</p>
<p>Thunder</p>
<p>That for thy mother’s fault 731 art thus exposed</p>
<p>To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,</p>
<p>But my heart bleeds. And most accursed am I</p>
<p>To be by oath enjoined 732 to this. Farewell!</p>
<p>The day frowns more and more: thou’rt like to have</p>
<p>A lullaby too rough. I never saw</p>
<p>The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour 733 !</p>
<p>Well may I get aboard. This is the chase 734 !</p>
<p>I am gone forever.</p>
<p>Exit, pursued by a bear 735</p>
<p>[Enter a Shepherd ]</p>
<p>SHEPHERD I would there were no age between ten and three-and-twenty,
or that youth would sleep out the rest, for there is nothing in the
between but getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry 736 ,
stealing, fighting — Hark you now! Would any but these boiled-brains 737
of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt this 738 weather? They have scared
away two of my best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find than
the master. If anywhere I have them, ’tis by the seaside, browsing of
739 ivy. Good luck, an’t be thy 740 will. What have we here? Mercy on’s,
a bairn 741 ? A very pretty bairn! A boy or a child 742 , I wonder? A
pretty one, a very pretty one. Sure, some scape 743 . Though I am not
bookish 744 , yet I can read waiting- gentlewoman in the scape. This has
been some stair-work, some trunk-work, some behind-door-work 745 : they
were warmer 746 that got 747 this than the poor thing is here. I’ll take
it up for pity — yet I’ll tarry 748 till my son come. He hallooed 749
but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!</p>
<p>Sees the baby</p>
<p>Enter Clown 750</p>
<p>CLOWN Hilloa, loa!</p>
<p>SHEPHERD What? Art so near? If thou’lt see a thing to talk on 751
when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What ailest 752 thou,
man?</p>
<p>CLOWN I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land! But I am not
to say it is a sea, for it is now the sky: betwixt the firmament 753 and
it you cannot thrust a bodkin 754 ’s point.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Why, boy, how is it?</p>
<p>CLOWN I would you did but see how it chafes 755 , how it rages, how
it takes up 756 the shore! But that’s not to the point. O, the most
piteous cry of the poor souls! Sometimes to see ’em, and not to see ’em.
Now the ship boring 757 the moon with her main-mast, and anon 758
swallowed with yeast 759 and froth, as you’d thrust a cork into a
hogshead 760 . And then for the land-service 761 , to see how the bear
tore out his shoulder-bone. How he cried to me for help and said his
name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an end of the ship 762 , to
see how the sea flap-dragoned 763 it. But first, how the poor souls
roared, and the sea mocked them. And how the poor gentleman roared and
the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than the sea or weather.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Name of mercy, when was this, boy?</p>
<p>CLOWN Now, now. I have not winked 764 since I saw these sights. The
men are not yet cold under water, nor the bear half dined on the
gentleman. He’s at it now.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Would I had been by 765 , to have helped the old man!</p>
<p>CLOWN I would you had been by the ship side, to have helped her;
there your charity would have lacked footing 766 .</p>
<p>SHEPHERD Heavy 767 matters, heavy matters! But look thee here, boy.
Now bless thyself. Thou met’st 768 with things dying, I with things
newborn. Here’s a sight for thee: look thee, a bearing-cloth 769 for a
squire 770 ’s child. Look thee here. Take up, take up, boy. Open’t. So,
let’s see — it was told me I should be rich by the fairies — this is
some changeling 771 . Open’t. What’s within, boy?</p>
<p>CLOWN You’re a made old man. If the sins of your youth are forgiven
you, you’re well to live 772 . Gold, all gold!</p>
<p>Opens the box</p>
<p>SHEPHERD This is fairy gold 773 , boy, and ’twill prove so. Up
with’t, keep it close 774 . Home, home, the next 775 way. We are lucky,
boy, and to be so still 776 requires nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep
go. Come, good boy, the next way home.</p>
<p>CLOWN Go you the next way with your findings. I’ll go see if the bear
be gone from the gentleman and how much he hath eaten. They are never
curst 777 but when they are hungry. If there be any of him left, I’ll
bury it.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD That’s a good deed. If thou mayst discern by that which is
left of him what 778 he is, fetch me to th’sight of him.</p>
<p>CLOWN Marry 779 , will I. And you shall help to put him
i’th’ground.</p>
<p>SHEPHERD ’Tis a lucky day, boy, and we’ll do good deeds on’t.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
