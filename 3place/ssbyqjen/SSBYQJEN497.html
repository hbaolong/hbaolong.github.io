<h4 id="scene-2-96-running-scene-2">Scene 2 96 / running scene 2</h4>
<p>Enter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius,
Laertes and his sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant</p>
<p>KING Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death</p>
<p>The memory be green 97 , and that it us befitted</p>
<p>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom</p>
<p>To be contracted 98 in one brow of woe,</p>
<p>Yet so far hath discretion 99 fought with nature</p>
<p>That we with wisest sorrow think on him</p>
<p>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</p>
<p>Therefore our sometime 100 sister, now our queen,</p>
<p>Th’imperial jointress 101 of this warlike state,</p>
<p>Have we, as ’twere with a defeated joy,</p>
<p>With one auspicious and one dropping eye 102 ,</p>
<p>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,</p>
<p>In equal scale weighing delight and dole 103 ,</p>
<p>Taken to wife; nor have we herein barred 104</p>
<p>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</p>
<p>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</p>
<p>Now follows that you know 105 young Fortinbras,</p>
<p>Holding a weak supposal 106 of our worth,</p>
<p>Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death</p>
<p>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</p>
<p>Colleaguèd 107 with the dream of his advantage 108 ,</p>
<p>He hath not failed to pester us with message</p>
<p>Importing 109 the surrender of those lands</p>
<p>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</p>
<p>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</p>
<p>Enter Voltemand and Cornelius</p>
<p>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting,</p>
<p>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</p>
<p>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras —</p>
<p>Who, impotent 110 and bedrid 111 , scarcely hears</p>
<p>Of this his nephew’s purpose — to suppress</p>
<p>His 112 further gait 113 herein, in that the levies,</p>
<p>The lists and full proportions, are all made</p>
<p>Out of his subject 114 . And we here dispatch</p>
<p>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,</p>
<p>For bearing of this greeting to old Norway,</p>
<p>Giving to you no further personal power</p>
<p>To 115 business with the king, more than the scope</p>
<p>Of these dilated articles 116 allow.</p>
<p>Gives a paper</p>
<p>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty 117 .</p>
<p>VOLTEMAND In that, and all things, will we show our duty.</p>
<p>KING We doubt it nothing 118 : heartily farewell.—</p>
<p>Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius</p>
<p>And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?</p>
<p>You told us of some suit 119 : what is’t, Laertes?</p>
<p>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane 120</p>
<p>And lose your voice 121 : what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,</p>
<p>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking 122 ?</p>
<p>The head is not more native 123 to the heart,</p>
<p>The hand more instrumental 124 to the mouth,</p>
<p>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.</p>
<p>What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</p>
<p>LAERTES Dread my lord 125 ,</p>
<p>Your leave and favour 126 to return to France,</p>
<p>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark</p>
<p>To show my duty in your coronation,</p>
<p>Yet now I must confess, that duty done,</p>
<p>My thoughts and wishes bend again towards France</p>
<p>And bow them 127 to your gracious leave and pardon 128 .</p>
<p>KING Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?</p>
<p>POLONIUS He hath, my lord:</p>
<p>I do beseech you, give him leave to go.</p>
<p>KING Take thy fair hour, Laertes: time be thine,</p>
<p>And thy best graces 129 spend it at thy will.—</p>
<p>But now, my cousin 130 Hamlet, and my son—</p>
<p>HAMLET A little more than kin and less than kind 131 132 .</p>
<p>KING How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</p>
<p>HAMLET Not so, my lord:— I am too much i’th’sun.</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Good Hamlet, cast thy nightly colour 133 off,</p>
<p>And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.</p>
<p>Do not forever with thy veilèd lids 134</p>
<p>Seek for thy noble father in the dust:</p>
<p>Thou know’st ’tis common 135 , all that lives must die,</p>
<p>Passing through nature to eternity.</p>
<p>HAMLET Ay, madam, it is common.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE If it be,</p>
<p>Why seems it so particular 136 with thee?</p>
<p>HAMLET ‘Seems’, madam? Nay it is: I know not ‘seems’.</p>
<p>’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</p>
<p>Nor customary 137 suits of solemn black,</p>
<p>Nor windy suspiration 138 of forced breath,</p>
<p>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</p>
<p>Nor the dejected ’haviour of the visage 139 ,</p>
<p>Together with all forms, moods 140 , shows of grief,</p>
<p>That can denote 141 me truly: these indeed seem,</p>
<p>For they are actions that a man might play,</p>
<p>But I have that within which passeth 142 show;</p>
<p>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</p>
<p>KING ’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</p>
<p>To give these mourning duties to your father:</p>
<p>But you must know your father lost a father,</p>
<p>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</p>
<p>In filial obligation for some term</p>
<p>To do obsequious 143 sorrow. But to persever 144</p>
<p>In obstinate condolement 145 is a course</p>
<p>Of impious stubbornness: ’tis unmanly grief:</p>
<p>It shows a will most incorrect 146 to heaven,</p>
<p>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient 147 ,</p>
<p>An understanding simple and unschooled.</p>
<p>For what we know must be and is as common</p>
<p>As any the most vulgar thing to sense 148 ,</p>
<p>Why should we in our peevish 149 opposition</p>
<p>Take it to heart? Fie 150 , ’tis a fault to heaven,</p>
<p>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</p>
<p>To reason most absurd, whose common theme</p>
<p>Is death of fathers, and who still 151 hath cried,</p>
<p>From the first corpse till he that died today,</p>
<p>‘This must be so.’ We pray you throw to earth</p>
<p>This unprevailing 152 woe, and think of us</p>
<p>As of a father; for let the world take note,</p>
<p>You are the most immediate 153 to our throne,</p>
<p>And with no less nobility of love</p>
<p>Than that which dearest father bears his son,</p>
<p>Do I impart towards you. For 154 your intent</p>
<p>In going back to school in Wittenberg 155 ,</p>
<p>It is most retrograde 156 to our desire,</p>
<p>And we beseech you bend you 157 to remain</p>
<p>Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</p>
<p>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</p>
<p>GERTRUDE Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:</p>
<p>I prithee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.</p>
<p>HAMLET I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</p>
<p>KING Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.</p>
<p>Be as ourself in Denmark.— Madam, come:</p>
<p>This gentle 158 and unforced accord 159 of Hamlet</p>
<p>Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof 160 ,</p>
<p>No jocund health 161 that Denmark 162 drinks today</p>
<p>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell 163 ,</p>
<p>And the king’s rouse 164 the heavens shall bruit 165 again,</p>
<p>Re-speaking 166 earthly thunder. Come away.</p>
<p>Exeunt. Hamlet remains</p>
<p>HAMLET O, that this too too solid flesh would melt,</p>
<p>Thaw and resolve 167 Everlasting 168 itself into a dew!</p>
<p>Or that the Everlasting had not fixed</p>
<p>His canon 169 gainst self-slaughter! O God, O God!</p>
<p>How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable</p>
<p>Seem to me all the uses 170 of this world!</p>
<p>Fie on’t! O, fie, fie! ’Tis an unweeded garden</p>
<p>That grows to seed: things rank and gross 171 in nature</p>
<p>Possess it merely 172 . That it should come to 173 this!</p>
<p>But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two.</p>
<p>So excellent a king, that was to this</p>
<p>Hyperion 174 to a satyr 175 , so loving to my mother</p>
<p>That he might not beteem 176 the winds of heaven</p>
<p>Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth,</p>
<p>Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him</p>
<p>As if increase of appetite had grown</p>
<p>By what it fed on, and yet within a month —</p>
<p>Let me not think on’t: frailty, thy name is woman! —</p>
<p>A little month, or ere 177 those shoes were old</p>
<p>With which she followed my poor father’s body,</p>
<p>Like Niobe 178 , all tears: why she, even she —</p>
<p>O, heaven! A beast that wants discourse of reason 179</p>
<p>Would have mourned longer — married with mine uncle,</p>
<p>My father’s brother but no more like my father</p>
<p>Than I to Hercules 180 . Within a month?</p>
<p>Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous 181 tears</p>
<p>Had left the flushing 182 of her gallèd 183 eyes,</p>
<p>She married. O, most wicked speed, to post 184</p>
<p>With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!</p>
<p>It is not nor it cannot come to good:</p>
<p>But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue.</p>
<p>Enter Horatio, Barnardo and Marcellus</p>
<p>HORATIO Hail to your lordship!</p>
<p>HAMLET I am glad to see you well:</p>
<p>Horatio — or I do forget myself.</p>
<p>Recognizes him</p>
<p>HORATIO The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.</p>
<p>HAMLET Sir, my good friend, I’ll change that name with you 185 .</p>
<p>And what make you from 186 Wittenberg, Horatio?— Marcellus.</p>
<p>MARCELLUS My good lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET I am very glad to see you.— Good even 187 , sir.—</p>
<p>To Barnardo</p>
<p>But what in faith make you from Wittenberg?</p>
<p>To Horatio</p>
<p>HORATIO A truant 188 disposition, good my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET I would not have your enemy say so,</p>
<p>Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,</p>
<p>To make it truster of your own report</p>
<p>Against yourself: I know you are no truant.</p>
<p>But what is your affair in Elsinore?</p>
<p>We’ll teach you to drink deep ere 189 you depart.</p>
<p>HORATIO My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.</p>
<p>HAMLET I pray thee do not mock me, fellow student:</p>
<p>I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.</p>
<p>HORATIO Indeed, my lord, it followed hard 190 upon.</p>
<p>HAMLET Thrift 191 , thrift, Horatio! The funeral baked meats 192</p>
<p>Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.</p>
<p>Would I had met my dearest 193 foe in heaven</p>
<p>Ere I had ever seen that day, Horatio.</p>
<p>My father, methinks I see my father.</p>
<p>HORATIO O, where, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET In my mind’s eye, Horatio.</p>
<p>HORATIO I saw him once; he was a goodly king.</p>
<p>HAMLET He was a man, take him for all in all:</p>
<p>I shall not look upon his like again.</p>
<p>HORATIO My lord, I think I saw him yesternight 194 .</p>
<p>HAMLET Saw who?</p>
<p>HORATIO My lord, the king your father.</p>
<p>HAMLET The king my father?</p>
<p>HORATIO Season your admiration 195 for a while</p>
<p>With an attent 196 ear till I may deliver 197 ,</p>
<p>Upon the witness of these gentlemen,</p>
<p>This marvel to you.</p>
<p>HAMLET For heaven’s love, let me hear.</p>
<p>HORATIO Two nights together had these gentlemen,</p>
<p>Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch,</p>
<p>In the dead waste 198 and middle of the night,</p>
<p>Been thus encountered. A figure like your father,</p>
<p>Armed at all points 199 exactly, cap-à-pie 200 ,</p>
<p>Appears before them, and with solemn march</p>
<p>Goes 201 slow and stately: by them thrice he walked,</p>
<p>By their oppressed and fear-surprisèd 202 eyes</p>
<p>Within his truncheon 203 ’s length, whilst they, distilled 204</p>
<p>Almost to jelly with the act 205 of fear</p>
<p>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me</p>
<p>In dreadful 206 secrecy impart they did,</p>
<p>And I with them the third night kept the watch,</p>
<p>Where, as they had delivered, both in time,</p>
<p>Form of the thing, each word made true and good,</p>
<p>The apparition comes. I knew your father:</p>
<p>These hands are not more like 207 .</p>
<p>HAMLET But where was this?</p>
<p>MARCELLUS My lord, upon the platform 208 where we watched.</p>
<p>HAMLET Did you not speak to it?</p>
<p>HORATIO My lord, I did;</p>
<p>But answer made it none. Yet once methought</p>
<p>It lifted up its head and did address</p>
<p>Itself to motion, like as it would speak 209 :</p>
<p>But even then the morning cock crew loud,</p>
<p>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away</p>
<p>And vanished from our sight.</p>
<p>HAMLET ’Tis very strange.</p>
<p>HORATIO As I do live, my honoured lord, ’tis true;</p>
<p>And we did think it writ down in our duty</p>
<p>To let you know of it.</p>
<p>HAMLET Indeed, indeed, sirs; but this troubles me.</p>
<p>Hold you the watch tonight?</p>
<p>MARCELLUS and BARNARDO We do, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET Armed, say you?</p>
<p>MARCELLUS and BARNARDO Armed, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET From top to toe?</p>
<p>MARCELLUS and BARNARDO My lord, from head to foot.</p>
<p>HAMLET Then saw you not his face?</p>
<p>HORATIO O, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver 210 up.</p>
<p>HAMLET What, looked he frowningly?</p>
<p>HORATIO A countenance 211 more in sorrow than in anger.</p>
<p>HAMLET Pale or red?</p>
<p>HORATIO Nay, very pale.</p>
<p>HAMLET And fixed his eyes upon you?</p>
<p>HORATIO Most constantly.</p>
<p>HAMLET I would I had been there.</p>
<p>HORATIO It would have much amazed you.</p>
<p>HAMLET Very like, very like. Stayed it long?</p>
<p>HORATIO While one with moderate haste might tell 212 a hundred.</p>
<p>MARCELLUS and BARNARDO Longer, longer.</p>
<p>HORATIO Not when I saw’t.</p>
<p>HAMLET His beard was grizzly 213 , no?</p>
<p>HORATIO It was, as I have seen it in his life,</p>
<p>A sable silvered 214 .</p>
<p>HAMLET I’ll watch tonight; perchance ’twill walk again.</p>
<p>HORATIO I warrant 215 you it will.</p>
<p>HAMLET If it assume my noble father’s person,</p>
<p>I’ll speak to it though hell itself should gape</p>
<p>And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,</p>
<p>If you have hitherto concealed this sight,</p>
<p>Let it be tenable 216 in your silence still 217 ,</p>
<p>And whatsoever else shall hap tonight,</p>
<p>Give it an understanding but no tongue.</p>
<p>I will requite 218 your loves. So, fare ye well:</p>
<p>Upon the platform ’twixt eleven and twelve</p>
<p>I’ll visit you.</p>
<p>ALL Our duty to your honour.</p>
<p>Exeunt [all but Hamlet]</p>
<p>HAMLET Your love, as mine to you: farewell.—</p>
<p>My father’s spirit in arms? All is not well:</p>
<p>I doubt 219 some foul play. Would the night were come.</p>
<p>Till then, sit still my soul: foul deeds will rise,</p>
<p>Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
