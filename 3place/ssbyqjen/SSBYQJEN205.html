continues</h4>
<p>Enter Clown [Touchstone ] , Audrey and Jaques [behind ]</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Come apace 786 , good Audrey. I will fetch up your goats,
Audrey. And how 787 , Audrey, am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature
788 content you?</p>
<p>AUDREY Your features? Lord warrant 789 us! What features?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious
790 poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths 791 .</p>
<p>JAQUES O, knowledge ill-inhabited 792 , worse than Jove in a thatched
house 793 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE When a man’s verses cannot be understood, nor a man’s good
wit seconded 794 with the forward 795 child, understanding, it strikes a
man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room 796 . Truly, I
would the gods had made thee poetical.</p>
<p>AUDREY I do not know what ‘poetical’ is. Is it honest 797 in deed and
word? Is it a true thing?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most feigning 798
, and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be
said as lovers, they do feign.</p>
<p>AUDREY Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE I do truly, for thou swear’st to me thou art honest 799 .
Now if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign.</p>
<p>AUDREY Would you not have me honest?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured 800 , for
honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.</p>
<p>JAQUES A material 801 fool!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>AUDREY Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods make me
honest.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul 802 slut 803
were to put good meat 804 into an unclean dish 805 .</p>
<p>AUDREY I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness
may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will marry thee, and to
that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext 806 , the vicar of the next
807 village, who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest
and to couple 808 us.</p>
<p>JAQUES I would fain 809 see this meeting 810 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>AUDREY Well, the gods give us joy!</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger
811 in this attempt, for here we have no temple but the wood, no
assembly 812 but horn-beasts 813 . But what though 814 ? Courage! As
horns are odious, they are necessary 815 . It is said, ‘many a man knows
no end of his goods 816’. Right. Many a man has good horns, and knows no
end of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife: ’tis none of his own
getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no: the noblest deer 817
hath them as huge as the rascal 818 . Is the single man therefore
blessed? No: as a walled 819 town is more worthier than a village, so is
the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
bachelor. And by how much defence 820 is better than no skill, by so
much is a horn more precious than to want 821 .</p>
<p>Enter Sir Oliver Martext</p>
<p>Here comes Sir Oliver.— Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will
you dispatch us 822 here under this tree, or shall we go with you to
your chapel?</p>
<p>SIR OLIVER Is there none here to give the woman?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE I will not take her on 823 gift of any man.</p>
<p>SIR OLIVER Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not
lawful.</p>
<p>JAQUES Proceed, proceed I’ll give her.</p>
<p>Steps forward</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Good even, good Master What-ye-call’t 824 . How do you,
sir? You are very well met. God ’ild 825 you for your last 826 company,
I am very glad to see you. Even a toy in hand 827 here, sir. Nay, pray
be covered 828 .</p>
<p>JAQUES Will you be married, motley?</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE As the ox hath his bow 829 , sir, the horse his curb 830
and the falcon her bells 831 , so man hath his desires, and as pigeons
bill 832 , so wedlock would be nibbling 833 .</p>
<p>JAQUES And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a
bush like a beggar? Get you to church, and have a good priest that can
tell you what marriage is: this fellow will but join you together as
they join wainscot 834 , then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and,
like green 835 timber, warp 836 , warp.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE I am not in the mind but 837 I were better to be married
of 838 him than of another, for he is not like 839 to marry me well 840
, and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me hereafter
to leave my wife.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>JAQUES Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.</p>
<p>TOUCHSTONE Come, sweet Audrey:</p>
<p>We must be married, or we must live in bawdry 841 .</p>
<p>Farewell, good Master Oliver. Not —</p>
<p>’O sweet Oliver, O brave Oliver,</p>
<p>Leave me not behind thee’ 842</p>
<p>but —</p>
<p>’Wind 843 away,</p>
<p>Begone, I say,</p>
<p>I will not to wedding with thee.’</p>
<p>SIR OLIVER ’Tis no matter; ne’er a fantastical 844 knave of them all
shall flout 845 me out of my calling.</p>
<p>Exeunt [separately ]</p>
