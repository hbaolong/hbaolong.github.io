<h4 id="scene-1-39-running-scene-1">Scene 1 39 ／ running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter Lord Bardolph and the Porter [separately ]</p>
<p>LORD BARDOLPH Who keeps 40 the gate here, ho?</p>
<p>Where is the earl?</p>
<p>PORTER What 41 shall I say you are?</p>
<p>LORD BARDOLPH Tell thou the earl</p>
<p>That the lord Bardolph doth attend 42 him here.</p>
<p>PORTER His lordship is 43 walked forth into the orchard 44 .</p>
<p>Please it 45 your honour, knock but at the gate,</p>
<p>And he himself will answer.</p>
<p>Enter Northumberland</p>
<p>LORD BARDOLPH Here comes the earl.</p>
<p>[Exit Porter ]</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND What news, Lord Bardolph? Every minute now</p>
<p>Should be the father of some stratagem 46 ;</p>
<p>The times are wild 47 : contention, like a horse</p>
<p>Full of high feeding 48 , madly hath broke loose</p>
<p>And bears down 49 all before him.</p>
<p>LORD BARDOLPH Noble earl,</p>
<p>I bring you certain 50 news from Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Good, an 51 heaven will 52 !</p>
<p>LORD BARDOLPH As good as heart can wish:</p>
<p>The king is almost wounded to the death</p>
<p>And, in the fortune of my lord your son 53 ,</p>
<p>Prince Harry slain outright, and both the Blunts 54</p>
<p>Killed by the hand of Douglas, young Prince 55 John</p>
<p>And Westmorland 56 and Stafford 57 fled the field,</p>
<p>And Harry Monmouth’s brawn 58 , the hulk 59 Sir John 60 ,</p>
<p>Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day,</p>
<p>So fought, so followed 61 and so fairly won,</p>
<p>Came not till now to dignify the times</p>
<p>Since Caesar’s fortunes 62 !</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND How is this derived 63 ?</p>
<p>Saw you the field? Came you from Shrewsbury?</p>
<p>LORD BARDOLPH I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,</p>
<p>A gentleman well bred and of good name,</p>
<p>That freely rendered 64 me these news for true.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Here comes my servant Travers 65 , whom I sent</p>
<p>On Tuesday last to listen after news.</p>
<p>Enter Travers</p>
<p>LORD BARDOLPH My lord, I over-rode 66 him on the way,</p>
<p>And he is furnished with no certainties</p>
<p>More than he haply 67 may retail 68 from me.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Now, Travers, what good tidings comes from you?</p>
<p>TRAVERS My lord, Sir John Umfrevile 69 turned me back</p>
<p>With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,</p>
<p>Outrode 70 me. After him came spurring hard</p>
<p>A gentleman, almost forspent 71 with speed,</p>
<p>That stopped by me to breathe 72 his bloodied 73 horse.</p>
<p>He asked the way to Chester 74 , and of him</p>
<p>I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:</p>
<p>He told me that rebellion had ill luck</p>
<p>And that young Harry Percy’s spur was cold.</p>
<p>With that, he gave his able 75 horse the head 76 ,</p>
<p>And bending forwards struck his able 77 heels</p>
<p>Against the panting sides of his poor jade 78</p>
<p>Up to the rowel-head 79 , and starting so</p>
<p>He seemed in running to devour the way 80 ,</p>
<p>Staying 81 no longer question.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Ha? Again:</p>
<p>Said he young Harry Percy’s spur was cold?</p>
<p>Of Hotspur Coldspur? That rebellion</p>
<p>Had met ill luck?</p>
<p>LORD BARDOLPH My lord, I’ll tell you what:</p>
<p>If my young lord your son have not the day 82 ,</p>
<p>Upon mine honour, for a silken point 83</p>
<p>I’ll give my barony 84 . Never talk of it.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Why should the gentleman that rode by Travers</p>
<p>Give then such instances 85 of loss?</p>
<p>LORD BARDOLPH Who, he?</p>
<p>He was some hilding 86 fellow that had stolen</p>
<p>The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,</p>
<p>Spoke at a venture 87 . Look, here comes more news.</p>
<p>Enter Morton 88</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Yea, this man’s brow, like to a title-leaf 89 ,</p>
<p>Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:</p>
<p>So looks the strand 90 when the imperious flood 91</p>
<p>Hath left a witnessed usurpation 92 .—</p>
<p>Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?</p>
<p>MORTON I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord,</p>
<p>Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask</p>
<p>To fright our party.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND How doth my son and brother?</p>
<p>Thou trembl’st; and the whiteness in thy cheek</p>
<p>Is apter 93 than thy tongue to tell thy errand.</p>
<p>Even 94 such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</p>
<p>So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,</p>
<p>Drew 95 Priam 96 ’s curtain 97 in the dead of night,</p>
<p>And would have told him half his Troy was burned.</p>
<p>But Priam found the fire ere 98 he his tongue,</p>
<p>And I my Percy’s death ere thou report’st it.</p>
<p>This thou wouldst say, ’Your son did thus and thus.</p>
<p>Your brother thus. So fought the noble Douglas’,</p>
<p>Stopping 99 my greedy ear with their bold deeds.</p>
<p>But in the end, to stop mine ear indeed 100 ,</p>
<p>Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,</p>
<p>Ending with ‘Brother, son, and all are dead.’</p>
<p>MORTON Douglas is living, and your brother, yet.</p>
<p>But, for my lord your son—</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Why, he is dead.</p>
<p>See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!</p>
<p>He that but fears the thing he would not know</p>
<p>Hath by instinct knowledge from others’ eyes</p>
<p>That what he feared is chanced 101 . Yet speak, Morton —</p>
<p>Tell thou thy earl his divination 102 lies,</p>
<p>And I will take it as a sweet disgrace</p>
<p>And make thee rich for doing me such wrong 103 .</p>
<p>MORTON You are too great to be by me gainsaid 104 :</p>
<p>Your spirit 105 is too true, your fears too certain.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Yet, for all this, say not that Percy’s dead.</p>
<p>I see a strange confession in thine eye:</p>
<p>Thou shak’st thy head and hold’st 106 it fear or sin</p>
<p>To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so:</p>
<p>The tongue offends not that reports his death.</p>
<p>And he doth sin that doth belie 107 the dead,</p>
<p>Not he which says the dead is not alive.</p>
<p>Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news</p>
<p>Hath but a losing office 108 , and his tongue</p>
<p>Sounds ever after as a sullen 109 bell,</p>
<p>Rememb’red knolling 110 a departing friend.</p>
<p>LORD BARDOLPH I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.</p>
<p>MORTON I am sorry I should force you to believe</p>
<p>That which I would 111 to heaven I had not seen.</p>
<p>But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,</p>
<p>Rend’ring faint quittance 112 , wearied and out-breathed 113 ,</p>
<p>To Henry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down</p>
<p>The never-daunted 114 Percy to the earth,</p>
<p>From whence with life he never more sprung up.</p>
<p>In few 115 , his death, whose spirit lent a fire</p>
<p>Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,</p>
<p>Being bruited 116 once, took fire and heat away</p>
<p>From the best tempered 117 courage in his troops,</p>
<p>For from his mettle 118 was his party steeled 119 ;</p>
<p>Which once in him abated 120 , all the rest</p>
<p>Turned on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.</p>
<p>And as the thing that’s heavy in itself,</p>
<p>Upon enforcement 121 flies with greatest speed,</p>
<p>So did our men, heavy in 122 Hotspur’s loss,</p>
<p>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear 123</p>
<p>That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim</p>
<p>Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</p>
<p>Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester 124</p>
<p>Too soon ta’en prisoner. And that furious Scot,</p>
<p>The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring 125 sword</p>
<p>Had three times slain th’appearance of the king 126 ,</p>
<p>’Gan vail his stomach 127 and did grace 128 the shame</p>
<p>Of those that turned their backs 129 , and in his flight,</p>
<p>Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all</p>
<p>Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out</p>
<p>A speedy power 130 to encounter 131 you, my lord,</p>
<p>Under the conduct of young Lancaster 132</p>
<p>And Westmorland. This is the news at 133 full.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND For this I shall have time enough to mourn.</p>
<p>In poison there is physic 134 , and this news,</p>
<p>Having been well 135 , that would have made me sick,</p>
<p>Being sick, have in some measure made me well.</p>
<p>And as the wretch, whose fever-weakened joints,</p>
<p>Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,</p>
<p>Impatient of his fit 136 , breaks like a fire</p>
<p>Out of his keeper 137 ’s arms, even so my limbs,</p>
<p>Weakened 138 with grief, being now enraged with grief,</p>
<p>Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice 139 crutch!</p>
<p>Throws down his crutch</p>
<p>A scaly gauntlet 140 now with joints of steel</p>
<p>Must glove this hand. And hence, thou sickly coif 141 !</p>
<p>Throws down his nightcap</p>
<p>Thou art a guard too wanton 142 for the head</p>
<p>Which princes, fleshed 143 with conquest, aim to hit.</p>
<p>Now bind my brows with iron, and approach</p>
<p>The ragged’st 144 hour that time and spite dare bring</p>
<p>To frown upon th’enraged Northumberland!</p>
<p>Let heaven kiss earth! Now let not Nature’s hand</p>
<p>Keep the wild flood confined! Let order die!</p>
<p>And let the world no longer be a stage</p>
<p>To feed contention 145 in a ling’ring act 146 ,</p>
<p>But let one spirit of the first-born Cain 147</p>
<p>Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set</p>
<p>On bloody courses, the rude 148 scene may end,</p>
<p>And darkness be the burier of the dead!</p>
<p>LORD BARDOLPH Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.</p>
<p>MORTON The lives of all your loving complices 149</p>
<p>Lean on your health, the which, if you give o’er 150</p>
<p>To stormy passion 151 , must perforce 152 decay.</p>
<p>You cast th’event 153 of war, my noble lord,</p>
<p>And summed 154 the account of chance, before you said</p>
<p>‘Let us make head 155 .’ It was your presurmise 156</p>
<p>That in the dole 157 of blows, your son might drop 158 .</p>
<p>You knew he walked o’er perils on an edge 159 ,</p>
<p>More likely to fall in than to get o’er:</p>
<p>You were advised 160 his flesh was capable</p>
<p>Of 161 wounds and scars and that his forward 162 spirit</p>
<p>Would lift him where most trade of 163 danger ranged 164 :</p>
<p>Yet did you say ‘Go forth’, and none of this,</p>
<p>Though strongly apprehended 165 , could restrain</p>
<p>The stiff-borne 166 action. What hath then befallen,</p>
<p>Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,</p>
<p>More than that being which was like 167 to be?</p>
<p>LORD BARDOLPH We all that are engagèd to 168 this loss</p>
<p>Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas</p>
<p>That if we wrought our life was ten to one 169 .</p>
<p>And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed</p>
<p>Choked the respect 170 of likely peril feared.</p>
<p>And since we are o’erset 171 , venture again.</p>
<p>Come, we will all put forth 172 , body and goods.</p>
<p>MORTON ’Tis more than time 173 . And, my most noble lord,</p>
<p>I hear for certain, and do speak the truth:</p>
<p>The gentle 174 Archbishop of York is up 175</p>
<p>With well-appointed powers 176 . He is a man</p>
<p>Who with a double surety 177 binds his followers.</p>
<p>My lord your son had only but the corpse 178 ,</p>
<p>But 179 shadows and the shows of men, to fight,</p>
<p>For that same word, rebellion, did divide</p>
<p>The action of their bodies from their souls,</p>
<p>And they did fight with queasiness 180 , constrained,</p>
<p>As men drink potions 181 , that their weapons only</p>
<p>Seemed on our side. But, for their spirits and souls,</p>
<p>This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,</p>
<p>As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop</p>
<p>Turns insurrection to religion 182 .</p>
<p>Supposed 183 sincere and holy in his thoughts,</p>
<p>He’s followed both with body and with mind,</p>
<p>And doth enlarge his rising 184 with the blood</p>
<p>Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones 185 :</p>
<p>Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause:</p>
<p>Tells them he doth bestride 186 a bleeding land,</p>
<p>Gasping for life under great Bullingbrook 187 :</p>
<p>And more and less 188 do flock to follow him.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND I knew of this before. But, to speak truth,</p>
<p>This present grief had wiped it from my mind.</p>
<p>Go in with me, and counsel every man</p>
<p>The aptest 189 way for safety and revenge.</p>
<p>Get posts 190 and letters, and make friends with speed.</p>
<p>Never so few, nor never yet more need.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
