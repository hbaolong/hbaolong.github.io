<h4 id="scene-1-3-running-scene-1">Scene 1 3 ／ running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter Leonato Governor of Messina, Innogen 4 his wife, Hero 5 his
daughter and Beatrice 6 his niece, with a Messenger</p>
<p>LEONATO I learn in this letter that Don Peter 7 of Arago 8 n comes
this night to Messina.</p>
<p>Shows a letter</p>
<p>MESSENGER He is very near by this: he was not three leagues 9 off
when I left him.</p>
<p>LEONATO How many gentlemen have you lost in this action 10 ?</p>
<p>MESSENGER But few of any sort 11 , and none of name 12 .</p>
<p>LEONATO A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full
numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath bestowed much honour on a young
Florentine 13 called Claudio.</p>
<p>MESSENGER Much deserved on his part and equally remembered 14 by Don
Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the
figure 15 of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better bettered
expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.</p>
<p>LEONATO He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of
it.</p>
<p>MESSENGER I have already delivered him letters, and there appears
much joy in him, even so much that joy could not show itself modest
enough without a badge of bitterness 16 .</p>
<p>LEONATO Did he break out into tears?</p>
<p>MESSENGER In great measure.</p>
<p>LEONATO A kind 17 overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer 18
than those that are so washed. How much better is it to weep at joy than
to joy at weeping!</p>
<p>BEATRICE I pray you, is Signior Mountanto 19 returned from the wars
or no?</p>
<p>MESSENGER I know none of that name, lady: there was none such in the
army of any sort.</p>
<p>LEONATO What is he that you ask for, niece?</p>
<p>HERO My cousin means Signior Benedick 20 of Padua 21 .</p>
<p>MESSENGER O, he’s returned, and as pleasant 22 as ever he was.</p>
<p>BEATRICE He set up his bills 23 here in Messina and challenged Cupid
24 at the flight 25 : and my uncle’s fool 26 , reading the challenge,
subscribed for 27 Cupid and challenged him at the bird-bolt 28 . I pray
you, how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
he killed? For indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.</p>
<p>LEONATO Faith 29 , niece, you tax 30 Signior Benedick too much, but
he’ll be meet 31 with you, I doubt it not.</p>
<p>MESSENGER He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</p>
<p>BEATRICE You had musty victual 32 and he hath holp 33 to eat it: he’s
a very valiant trencherman 34 35 , he hath an excellent stomach 36 .</p>
<p>MESSENGER And a good soldier too, lady.</p>
<p>BEATRICE And a good soldier to 37 a lady. But what is he to a
lord?</p>
<p>MESSENGER A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed 38 with all
honourable virtues.</p>
<p>BEATRICE It is so indeed, he is no less than a stuffed man 39 . But
for the stuffing — well, we are all mortal.</p>
<p>LEONATO You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry
war betwixt 40 Signior Benedick and her: they never meet but there’s a
skirmish of wit between them.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of
his five wits 41 went halting 42 off, and now is the whole man governed
with one: so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
bear it for a difference 43 between himself and his horse, for it is all
the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature 44 . Who
is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother 45 .</p>
<p>MESSENGER Is’t possible?</p>
<p>BEATRICE Very easily possible: he wears his faith 46 but as the
fashion of his hat — it ever changes with the next block 47 .</p>
<p>MESSENGER I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books 48 .</p>
<p>BEATRICE No. An 49 he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you,
who is his companion? Is there no young squarer 50 now that will make a
voyage with him to the devil?</p>
<p>MESSENGER He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</p>
<p>BEATRICE O lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he is sooner
caught than the pestilence 51 , and the taker runs presently 52 mad. God
help the noble Claudio. If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him
a thousand pound ere 53 he be cured.</p>
<p>MESSENGER I will hold 54 friends with you, lady.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Do, good friend.</p>
<p>LEONATO You’ll ne’er run mad 55 , niece.</p>
<p>BEATRICE No, not till a hot January.</p>
<p>MESSENGER Don Pedro is approached.</p>
<p>Enter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar and John the
bastard</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Good Signior Leonato, are you come to meet your trouble 56
? The fashion 57 of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter
it.</p>
<p>LEONATO Never came trouble to my house in the likeness 58 of your
grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain. But when you
depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO You embrace your charge 59 too willingly. I think this is
your daughter.</p>
<p>LEONATO Her mother hath many times told me so.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?</p>
<p>LEONATO Signior Benedick, no, for then were you a child 60 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO You have it full 61 , Benedick. We may guess by this what
you are, being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself 62 . Be happy lady,
for you are like an honourable father.</p>
<p>BENEDICK If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his
head 63 on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.</p>
<p>Don Pedro and Leonato talk aside</p>
<p>BEATRICE I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick:
nobody marks 64 you.</p>
<p>BENEDICK What, my dear Lady Disdain! Are you yet living?</p>
<p>BEATRICE Is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet
65 food to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to
disdain, if you come in her presence.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Then is courtesy a turncoat 66 . But it is certain I am
loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I would 67 I could find in
my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.</p>
<p>BEATRICE A dear happiness 68 to women: they would else have been
troubled with a pernicious 69 suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I
am of your humour for that 70 . I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow
than a man swear he loves me.</p>
<p>BENEDICK God keep your ladyship still in that mind, so some gentleman
or other shall scape 71 a predestinate 72 scratched face.</p>
<p>BEATRICE Scratching could not make it worse an 73 ’twere such a face
as yours were.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher 74 .</p>
<p>BEATRICE A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours 75 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a
continuer 76 . But keep your way, a God’s name, I have done.</p>
<p>BEATRICE You always end with a jade 77 ’s trick 78 . I know you of
old.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO That is the sum of all, Leonato.— Signior Claudio and
Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell
him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some
occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but
prays from his heart.</p>
<p>To the others</p>
<p>LEONATO If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn 79 .— Let me
bid you welcome, my lord. Being 80 reconciled to the prince your
brother, I owe you all duty.</p>
<p>To Don John</p>
<p>DON JOHN I thank you. I am not of many words, but I thank you.</p>
<p>LEONATO Please it your grace lead on?</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Your hand, Leonato. We will go together.</p>
<p>Exeunt all but Benedick and Claudio</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior
Leonato?</p>
<p>BENEDICK I noted her not 81 , but I looked on her.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Is she not a modest young lady?</p>
<p>BENEDICK Do you question me as an honest man should do, for my simple
true judgement? Or would you have me speak after my custom 82 , as being
a professed tyrant to their sex?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO No, I pray thee speak in sober judgement.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Why, i’faith, methinks she’s too low 83 for a high 84
praise, too brown 85 for a fair 86 praise, and too little for a great
praise. Only this commendation I can afford 87 her, that were she other
than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do
not like her.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Thou think’st I am in sport 88 . I pray thee tell me truly
how thou lik’st her.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Can the world buy such a jewel?</p>
<p>BENEDICK Yea, and a case 89 to put it into. But speak you this with a
sad 90 brow? Or do you play the flouting jack 91 , to tell us Cupid is a
good hare-finder 92 and Vulcan 93 a rare carpenter? Come, in what key
shall a man take you to go 94 in the song?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO In mine eye, she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked
on.</p>
<p>BENEDICK I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter.
There’s her cousin, an she were not possessed with a fury 95 , exceeds
her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But
I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary,
if Hero would be my wife.</p>
<p>BENEDICK Is’t come to this? In faith, hath not the world one man but
he will wear his cap with suspicion 96 ? Shall I never see a bachelor of
threescore 97 again? Go to 98 , i’faith, an thou wilt needs thrust thy
neck into a yoke 99 , wear the print 100 of it and sigh away Sundays 101
. Look, Don Pedro is returned to seek you.</p>
<p>Enter Don Pedro [and ] John the bastard</p>
<p>DON PEDRO What secret hath held you here, that you followed not to
Leonato’s?</p>
<p>BENEDICK I would your grace would constrain 102 me to tell.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO I charge 103 thee on thy allegiance.</p>
<p>BENEDICK You hear, Count Claudio. I can be secret as a dumb man, I
would have you think so. But on my allegiance, mark you this, on my
allegiance — he is in love. With who? Now that is your grace’s part 104
. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato’s short daughter.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO If this were so, so were it uttered 105 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK Like the old tale, my lord: ‘It is not so, nor ’twas not so,
but indeed, God forbid it should be so!’ 106</p>
<p>CLAUDIO If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be
otherwise.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well
worthy.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO You speak this to fetch me in 107 , my lord.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO By my troth 108 , I speak my thought.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.</p>
<p>BENEDICK And by my two faiths and troths 109 , my lord, I spoke
mine.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO That I love her, I feel.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO That she is worthy, I know.</p>
<p>BENEDICK That I neither feel how she should be loved, nor know how
she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me: I
will die in it at the stake 110 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic 111 in the despite 112
of beauty.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO And never could maintain 113 his part but in the force of his
will 114 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK That a woman conceived me, I thank her. That she brought me
up, I likewise give her most humble thanks. But that I will have a
recheat 115 winded 116 in my forehead, or hang my bugle 117 in an
invisible baldric 118 k, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not
do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust
none. And the fine 119 is — for the which I may go the finer 120 — I
will live a bachelor.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.</p>
<p>BENEDICK With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord, not with
love: prove 121 that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get
again with drinking 122 , pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker 123 ’s
pen, and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for 124 the sign of
blind Cupid 125 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt
prove a notable argument 126 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me 127
, and he that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder and called
Adam 128 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Well, as try 129 . ‘In time the savage bull doth bear the
yoke.’ 130</p>
<p>BENEDICK The savage bull may, but if ever the sensible Benedick bear
it, pluck off the bull’s horns and set them in my forehead 131 , and let
me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write 132 ‘Here
is good horse to hire’, let them sign 133 ify under my sign ‘Here you
may see Benedick the married man.’</p>
<p>CLAUDIO If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad 134
.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver 135 in Venice
136 , thou wilt quake for this shortly.</p>
<p>BENEDICK I look for 137 an earthquake too, then.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Well, you will temporize with the hours 138 . In the
meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato’s, commend me to him,
and tell him I will not fail him 139 at supper, for indeed he hath made
great preparation.</p>
<p>BENEDICK I have almost matter 140 enough in me for such an embassage
141 , and so I commit you—</p>
<p>CLAUDIO To the tuition 142 of God. From my house, if I had it—</p>
<p>DON PEDRO The sixth of July. Your loving friend, Benedick 143 .</p>
<p>BENEDICK Nay, mock not, mock not; the body 144 of your discourse is
sometime guarded with fragments 145 , and the guards are but slightly
basted on neither 146 . Ere you flout old 147 ends any further, examine
your conscience. And so I leave you.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>CLAUDIO My liege, your Highness now may do me good 148 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,</p>
<p>And thou shalt see how apt 149 it is to learn</p>
<p>Any hard lesson that may do thee good.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO Hath Leonato any son, my lord?</p>
<p>DON PEDRO No child but Hero, she’s his only heir.</p>
<p>Dost thou affect 150 her, Claudio?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO O, my lord,</p>
<p>When you went onward on this ended action 151 ,</p>
<p>I looked upon her with a soldier’s eye</p>
<p>That liked, but had a rougher task in hand</p>
<p>Than to drive liking to the name of love.</p>
<p>But now I am returned, and that 152 war-thoughts</p>
<p>Have left their places vacant, in their rooms</p>
<p>Come thronging soft and delicate desires,</p>
<p>All prompting 153 me how fair young Hero is,</p>
<p>Saying I liked her ere I went to wars.</p>
<p>DON PEDRO Thou wilt be like a lover presently</p>
<p>And tire the hearer with a book of words 154 .</p>
<p>If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,</p>
<p>And I will break 155 with her and with her father,</p>
<p>And thou shalt have her. Wast not to this end</p>
<p>That thou began’st to twist 156 so fine a story?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO How sweetly you do minister to 157 love,</p>
<p>That know love’s grief by his complexion!</p>
<p>But lest my liking might too sudden seem,</p>
<p>I would have salved 158 it with a longer treatise 159 .</p>
<p>DON PEDRO What need the bridge much broader than the flood 160 ?</p>
<p>The fairest grant is the necessity 161 .</p>
<p>Look, what will serve is fit 162 : ’tis once 163 , thou lovest,</p>
<p>And I will fit 164 thee with the remedy.</p>
<p>I know we shall have revelling tonight.</p>
<p>I will assume thy part in some disguise</p>
<p>And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,</p>
<p>And in her bosom 165 I’ll unclasp 166 my heart,</p>
<p>And take her hearing prisoner with the force</p>
<p>And strong encounter 167 of my amorous tale.</p>
<p>Then after, to her father will I break,</p>
<p>And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.</p>
<p>In practice let us put it presently.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
