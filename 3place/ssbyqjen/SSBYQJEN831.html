<p>A march. Enter Edward, Richard and their power 287</p>
<p>EDWARD I wonder how our princely father scaped,</p>
<p>Or whether he be scaped away or no</p>
<p>From Clifford’s and Northumberland’s pursuit?</p>
<p>Had he been ta’en 288 , we should have heard the news:</p>
<p>Had he been slain, we should have heard the news:</p>
<p>Or had he scaped, methinks we should have heard</p>
<p>The happy tidings of his good escape.</p>
<p>How fares my brother? Why is he so sad?</p>
<p>RICHARD I cannot joy, until I be resolved 289</p>
<p>Where our right valiant father is become 290 .</p>
<p>I saw him in the battle range 291 about</p>
<p>And watched him how he singled Clifford forth 292 .</p>
<p>Methought he bore him 293 in the thickest troop</p>
<p>As doth a lion in a herd of neat 294 ,</p>
<p>Or as a bear encompassed round with dogs,</p>
<p>Who having pinched 295 a few and made them cry,</p>
<p>The rest stand all aloof 296 , and bark at him.</p>
<p>So fared our father with his enemies,</p>
<p>So fled his enemies my warlike father.</p>
<p>Methinks, ’tis prize 297 enough to be his son.</p>
<p>Three suns appear</p>
<p>See how the morning opes 298 her golden gates,</p>
<p>And takes her farewell of the glorious sun.</p>
<p>How well resembles it the prime of youth,</p>
<p>Trimmed 299 like a younker 300 prancing 301 to his love.</p>
<p>EDWARD Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns 302 ?</p>
<p>RICHARD Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun,</p>
<p>Not separated with the racking 303 clouds,</p>
<p>But severed 304 in a pale clear-shining sky.</p>
<p>See, see: they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,</p>
<p>As if they vowed some league inviolable.</p>
<p>Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.</p>
<p>In this the heaven figures 305 some event.</p>
<p>EDWARD ’Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.</p>
<p>I think it cites 306 us, brother, to the field,</p>
<p>That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,</p>
<p>Each one already blazing by our meeds 307 ,</p>
<p>Should notwithstanding join our lights together</p>
<p>And overshine 308 the earth, as this 309 the world.</p>
<p>Whate’er it bodes, henceforward will I bear</p>
<p>Upon my target 310 three fair-shining suns.</p>
<p>RICHARD Nay, bear three daughters 311 : by your leave, I speak
it,</p>
<p>You love the breeder 312 better than the male.</p>
<p>Enter one [a Messenger ] blowing 313</p>
<p>But what art thou, whose heavy 314 looks foretell</p>
<p>Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?</p>
<p>MESSENGER Ah, one that was a woeful looker-on</p>
<p>Whenas 315 the noble Duke of York was slain,</p>
<p>Your princely father and my loving lord!</p>
<p>EDWARD O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.</p>
<p>RICHARD Say how he died, for I will hear it all.</p>
<p>MESSENGER Environèd 316 he was with many foes,</p>
<p>And stood against them, as the hope of Troy 317</p>
<p>Against the Greeks that would have entered Troy.</p>
<p>But Hercules 318 himself must yield to odds,</p>
<p>And many strokes, though with a little axe,</p>
<p>Hews down and fells the hardest-timbered oak.</p>
<p>By many hands your father was subdued,</p>
<p>But only slaughtered by the ireful arm</p>
<p>Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,</p>
<p>Who crowned the gracious duke in high despite 319 ,</p>
<p>Laughed in his face, and when with grief he wept,</p>
<p>The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks</p>
<p>A napkin steepèd in the harmless 320 blood</p>
<p>Of sweet young Rutland, by rough 321 Clifford slain.</p>
<p>And after many scorns, many foul taunts,</p>
<p>They took his head, and on the gates of York</p>
<p>They set the same, and there it doth remain,</p>
<p>The saddest spectacle that e’er I viewed.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>EDWARD Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,</p>
<p>Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay 322 .</p>
<p>O Clifford, boist’rous 323 Clifford, thou hast slain</p>
<p>The flower of Europe for his chivalry,</p>
<p>And treacherously hast thou vanquished him,</p>
<p>For hand to hand he would have vanquished thee.</p>
<p>Now my soul’s palace 324 is become a prison.</p>
<p>Ah, would she 325 break from hence, that this my body</p>
<p>Might in the ground be closèd up in rest,</p>
<p>For never henceforth shall I joy again:</p>
<p>Never, O, never, shall I see more joy 326 !</p>
<p>RICHARD I cannot weep, for all my body’s moisture</p>
<p>Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart.</p>
<p>Nor can my tongue unload my heart’s great burden,</p>
<p>For selfsame wind 327 that I should speak withal</p>
<p>Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,</p>
<p>And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.</p>
<p>To weep is to make less the depth of grief:</p>
<p>Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me.</p>
<p>Richard, I bear thy name, I’ll venge 328 thy death,</p>
<p>Or die renownèd by attempting it.</p>
<p>EDWARD His name that valiant duke hath left with thee:</p>
<p>His dukedom and his chair 329 with me is left.</p>
<p>RICHARD Nay, if thou be that princely eagle’s bird,</p>
<p>Show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun 330 .</p>
<p>For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say,</p>
<p>Either that 331 is thine, or else thou wert not his.</p>
<p>March. Enter Warwick, Marquis [of ] Montague and their army</p>
<p>WARWICK How now, fair lords? What fare 332 ? What news abroad 333
?</p>
<p>RICHARD Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount</p>
<p>Our baleful 334 news, and at each word’s deliverance</p>
<p>Stab poniards 335 in our flesh till all were told,</p>
<p>The words would add more anguish than the wounds.</p>
<p>O, valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!</p>
<p>EDWARD O Warwick, Warwick, that Plantagenet</p>
<p>Which held thee dearly as his soul’s redemption,</p>
<p>Is by the stern 336 Lord Clifford done to death.</p>
<p>WARWICK Ten days ago I drowned these news in tears,</p>
<p>And now, to add more measure 337 to your woes,</p>
<p>I come to tell you things sith 338 then befall’n.</p>
<p>After the bloody fray at Wakefield 339 fought,</p>
<p>Where your brave father breathed his latest 340 gasp,</p>
<p>Tidings, as swiftly as the posts 341 could run,</p>
<p>Were brought me of your loss and his depart 342 .</p>
<p>I, then in London, keeper 343 of the king,</p>
<p>Mustered my soldiers, gathered flocks of friends,</p>
<p>Marched toward St Albans 344 to intercept the queen,</p>
<p>Bearing the king in my behalf 345 along.</p>
<p>For by my scouts I was advertis 346 èd</p>
<p>That she was coming with a full intent</p>
<p>To dash 347 our late 348 decree in parliament</p>
<p>Touching 349 King Henry’s oath and your succession.</p>
<p>Short tale to make, we at St Albans met</p>
<p>Our battles 350 joined, and both sides fiercely fought.</p>
<p>But whether ’twas the coldness 351 of the king,</p>
<p>Who looked full 352 gently on his warlike queen,</p>
<p>That robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen 353 ,</p>
<p>Or whether ’twas report of her success,</p>
<p>Or more than common fear of Clifford’s rigour 354 ,</p>
<p>Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</p>
<p>I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,</p>
<p>Their weapons like to 355 lightning came and went,</p>
<p>Our soldiers’ like the night-owl’s lazy flight,</p>
<p>Or like an idle thresher with a flail 356 ,</p>
<p>Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.</p>
<p>I cheered them up with justice of our cause,</p>
<p>With promise of high pay and great rewards,</p>
<p>But all in vain: they had no heart to fight,</p>
<p>And we in them no hope to win the day,</p>
<p>So that we fled. The king unto the queen,</p>
<p>Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,</p>
<p>In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you,</p>
<p>For in the marches 357 here we heard you were,</p>
<p>Making another head 358 to fight again.</p>
<p>EDWARD Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?</p>
<p>And when came George from Burgundy 359 to England?</p>
<p>WARWICK Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers,</p>
<p>And for your brother, he was lately sent</p>
<p>From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,</p>
<p>With aid of soldiers to this needful 360 war.</p>
<p>RICHARD ’Twas odds, belike 361 , when valiant Warwick fled;</p>
<p>Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit 362 ,</p>
<p>But ne’er till now his scandal of retire 363 .</p>
<p>WARWICK Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear,</p>
<p>For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine</p>
<p>Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry’s head,</p>
<p>And wring 364 the awful 365 sceptre from his fist,</p>
<p>Were he as famous and as bold in war</p>
<p>As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.</p>
<p>RICHARD I know it well, Lord Warwick, blame me not.</p>
<p>’Tis love I bear thy glories make me speak.</p>
<p>But in this troublous time, what’s to be done?</p>
<p>Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,</p>
<p>And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,</p>
<p>Numb’ring 366 our Ave Maries 367 with our beads 368 ?</p>
<p>Or shall we on the helmets of our foes</p>
<p>Tell 369 our devotion with revengeful arms?</p>
<p>If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.</p>
<p>WARWICK Why, therefore 370 Warwick came to seek you out,</p>
<p>And therefore comes my brother Montague.</p>
<p>Attend 371 me, lords: the proud insulting queen,</p>
<p>With Clifford and the haught 372 Northumberland,</p>
<p>And of their feather many more proud birds,</p>
<p>Have wrought 373 the easy-melting king like wax.</p>
<p>He swore consent to your succession,</p>
<p>His oath enrollèd 374 in the parliament.</p>
<p>And now to London all the crew 375 are gone,</p>
<p>To frustrate 376 both his oath and what beside 377</p>
<p>May make 378 against the house of Lancaster.</p>
<p>Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong.</p>
<p>Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,</p>
<p>With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,</p>
<p>Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,</p>
<p>Will but amount to five-and-twenty thousand,</p>
<p>Why, via 379 , to London will we march,</p>
<p>And once again bestride 380 our foaming steeds,</p>
<p>And once again cry ‘Charge!’ upon our foes,</p>
<p>But never once again turn back and fly.</p>
<p>RICHARD Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak;</p>
<p>Ne’er may he live to see a sunshine day,</p>
<p>That cries ‘Retire!’ 381 if Warwick bid him stay.</p>
<p>EDWARD Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean,</p>
<p>And when thou fail’st — as God forbid the hour —</p>
<p>Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend 382 !</p>
<p>WARWICK No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:</p>
<p>The next degree 383 is England’s royal throne.</p>
<p>For King of England shalt thou be proclaimed</p>
<p>In every borough as we pass along.</p>
<p>And he that throws not up his cap for joy</p>
<p>Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.</p>
<p>King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,</p>
<p>Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,</p>
<p>But sound the trumpets, and about our task.</p>
<p>RICHARD Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,</p>
<p>As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,</p>
<p>I come to pierce it or to give thee mine.</p>
<p>EDWARD Then strike up drums. God and Saint George 384 for us!</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>WARWICK How now? What news?</p>
<p>MESSENGER The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,</p>
<p>The queen is coming with a puissant host 385 ,</p>
<p>And craves 386 your company for speedy counsel.</p>
<p>WARWICK Why then it sorts 387 , brave warriors, let’s away.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
