20</h4>
<p>Enter in conquest, with Drum and Colours, Edmund, Lear and Cordelia
as prisoners, Soldiers, Captain</p>
<p>EDMUND Some officers take them away: good guard 1565 ,</p>
<p>Until their greater pleasures 1566 first be known</p>
<p>That are to censure 1567 them.</p>
<p>CORDELIA We are not the first</p>
<p>To Lear</p>
<p>Who with best meaning 1568 have incurred the worst.</p>
<p>For thee, oppressèd king, I am cast down 1569 :</p>
<p>Myself could else out-frown false fortune’s frown.</p>
<p>Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?</p>
<p>LEAR No, no, no, no! Come, let’s away to prison.</p>
<p>We two alone will sing like birds i’th’cage:</p>
<p>When thou dost ask me blessing, I’ll kneel down</p>
<p>And ask of thee forgiveness: so we’ll live,</p>
<p>And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh</p>
<p>At gilded butterflies 1570 , and hear poor rogues 1571</p>
<p>Talk of court news, and we’ll talk with them too —</p>
<p>Who loses and who wins, who’s in, who’s out —</p>
<p>And take upon’s the mystery of things 1572 ,</p>
<p>As if we were God’s spies 1573 : and we’ll wear out 1574</p>
<p>In a walled prison packs and sects 1575 of great ones</p>
<p>That ebb and flow by th’moon 1576 .</p>
<p>EDMUND Take them away.</p>
<p>LEAR Upon such sacrifices 1577 , my Cordelia,</p>
<p>The gods themselves throw incense 1578 . Have I caught thee?</p>
<p>He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven</p>
<p>And fire us hence like foxes 1579 . Wipe thine eyes:</p>
<p>The good years shall devour them, flesh and fell 1580 ,</p>
<p>Ere they shall make us weep: We’ll see ’em starved 1581 first.
Come.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Lear and Cordelia, guarded ]</p>
<p>EDMUND Come hither, captain, hark.</p>
<p>Take thou this note, go follow them to prison.</p>
<p>Gives a paper</p>
<p>One step I have advanced thee: if thou dost</p>
<p>As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way</p>
<p>To noble fortunes. Know thou this: that men</p>
<p>Are as the time is; to be tender-minded 1582</p>
<p>Does not become 1583 a sword. Thy great employment</p>
<p>Will not bear question 1584 : either say thou’lt do’t</p>
<p>Or thrive by other means.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN I’ll do’t, my lord.</p>
<p>EDMUND About it, and write happy 1585 when th’hast done.</p>
<p>Mark, I say, instantly, and carry 1586 it so</p>
<p>As I have set it down.</p>
<p>Exit Captain</p>
<p>Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Soldiers</p>
<p>ALBANY Sir, you have showed today your valiant strain 1587 ,</p>
<p>And fortune led you well. You have the captives</p>
<p>Who were the opposites 1588 of this day’s strife:</p>
<p>I do require them of you, so to use 1589 them</p>
<p>As we shall find their merits and our safety</p>
<p>May equally determine.</p>
<p>EDMUND Sir, I thought it fit</p>
<p>To send the old and miserable king to some retention 1590</p>
<p>Whose 1591 age had charms 1592 in it, whose title 1593 more,</p>
<p>To pluck the common bosom 1594 on his side</p>
<p>And turn our impressed lances in our eyes</p>
<p>Which do command them 1595 . With him I sent the queen 1596 ,</p>
<p>My reason all the same, and they are ready</p>
<p>Tomorrow, or at further space, t’appear</p>
<p>Where you shall hold your session 1597 .</p>
<p>ALBANY Sir, by your patience 1598 ,</p>
<p>I hold you but a subject of 1599 this war,</p>
<p>Not as a brother.</p>
<p>REGAN That’s as we list 1600 to grace him.</p>
<p>Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded 1601</p>
<p>Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,</p>
<p>Bore the commission 1602 of my place and person,</p>
<p>The which immediacy 1603 may well stand up</p>
<p>And call itself your brother.</p>
<p>GONERIL Not so hot:</p>
<p>In his own grace 1604 he doth exalt himself</p>
<p>More than in your addition 1605 .</p>
<p>REGAN In my rights,</p>
<p>By me invested, he compeers 1606 the best.</p>
<p>ALBANY That were the most 1607 if he should husband you.</p>
<p>REGAN Jesters do oft prove prophets.</p>
<p>GONERIL Holla 1608 , holla!</p>
<p>That eye that told you so looked but asquint 1609 .</p>
<p>REGAN Lady, I am not well, else I should answer</p>
<p>From a full-flowing stomach 1610 .— General,</p>
<p>To Edmund</p>
<p>Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony 1611 :</p>
<p>Dispose of 1612 them, of me: the walls 1613 is thine:</p>
<p>Witness the world 1614 that I create thee here</p>
<p>My lord and master.</p>
<p>GONERIL Mean you to enjoy 1615 him?</p>
<p>ALBANY The let-alone 1616 lies not in your good will.</p>
<p>EDMUND Nor in thine, lord.</p>
<p>ALBANY Half-blooded 1617 fellow, yes.</p>
<p>REGAN Let the drum strike and prove my title thine.</p>
<p>To Edmund</p>
<p>ALBANY Stay yet, hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee</p>
<p>On capital treason, and, in 1618 thy arrest,</p>
<p>This gilded serpent 1619 . For 1620 your claim, fair sister,</p>
<p>I bar it 1621 in the interest of my wife:</p>
<p>’Tis she is subcontracted 1622 to this lord,</p>
<p>And I, her husband, contradict your banns 1623 .</p>
<p>If you will marry, make your loves to 1624 me,</p>
<p>My lady is bespoke 1625 .</p>
<p>GONERIL An interlude 1626 !</p>
<p>ALBANY Thou art armed, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:</p>
<p>If none appear to prove upon thy person</p>
<p>Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,</p>
<p>There is my pledge 1627 : I’ll make it 1628 on thy heart,</p>
<p>Throws down a glove</p>
<p>Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing 1629 less</p>
<p>Than I have here proclaimed thee.</p>
<p>REGAN Sick, O, sick!</p>
<p>GONERIL If not, I’ll ne’er trust medicine 1630 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>EDMUND There’s my exchange: what 1631 in the world he’s</p>
<p>That names me traitor, villain-like he lies.</p>
<p>Throws down a glove</p>
<p>Call by the trumpet: he that dares approach,</p>
<p>On him, on you — who not? — I will maintain</p>
<p>My truth and honour firmly.</p>
<p>Enter a Herald</p>
<p>ALBANY A herald, ho!</p>
<p>Trust to thy single virtue 1632 , for thy soldiers,</p>
<p>To Edmund</p>
<p>All levied in my name, have in my name</p>
<p>Took their discharge.</p>
<p>REGAN My sickness grows upon me.</p>
<p>ALBANY She is not well: convey her to my tent.—</p>
<p>[Exit Regan, led ]</p>
<p>Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound</p>
<p>And read out this.</p>
<p>A trumpet sounds</p>
<p>HERALD Reads ‘If any man of quality or degree 1633 within the lists
1634 of the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester,
that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the
trumpet: he is bold in his defence.’</p>
<p>First trumpet</p>
<p>HERALD Again!</p>
<p>Second trumpet</p>
<p>HERALD Again!</p>
<p>Third trumpet</p>
<p>Trumpet answers within</p>
<p>Enter Edgar armed</p>
<p>His helmet visor down</p>
<p>ALBANY Ask him his purposes, why he appears</p>
<p>Upon this call o’th’trumpet.</p>
<p>HERALD What are you?</p>
<p>Your name, your quality, and why you answer</p>
<p>This present summons?</p>
<p>EDGAR Know, my name is lost</p>
<p>By treason’s tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit 1635 :</p>
<p>Yet am I noble as the adversary</p>
<p>I come to cope 1636 .</p>
<p>ALBANY Which is that adversary?</p>
<p>EDGAR What’s he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?</p>
<p>EDMUND Himself: what say’st thou to him?</p>
<p>EDGAR Draw thy sword,</p>
<p>That, if my speech offend a noble heart,</p>
<p>Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.</p>
<p>Draws</p>
<p>Behold, it is my privilege —</p>
<p>The privilege of mine honours —</p>
<p>My oath and my profession 1637 . I protest 1638 ,</p>
<p>Maugre 1639 thy strength, place 1640 , youth and eminence,</p>
<p>Despise thy victor sword and fire-new 1641 fortune,</p>
<p>Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor:</p>
<p>False to thy gods, thy brother and thy father,</p>
<p>Conspirant 1642 gainst this high illustrious prince,</p>
<p>And from th’extremest upward 1643 of thy head</p>
<p>To the descent 1644 and dust below thy foot</p>
<p>A most toad-spotted 1645 traitor. Say thou no,</p>
<p>This sword, this arm and my best spirits are bent 1646</p>
<p>To prove upon thy heart whereto I speak,</p>
<p>Thou liest.</p>
<p>EDMUND In wisdom I should ask thy name,</p>
<p>But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,</p>
<p>And that thy tongue some say 1647 of breeding breathes,</p>
<p>What safe and nicely 1648 I might well delay</p>
<p>By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.</p>
<p>Back do I toss these treasons to thy head,</p>
<p>With the hell-hated lie 1649 o’erwhelm thy heart,</p>
<p>Which, for they 1650 yet glance by 1651 and scarcely bruise,</p>
<p>This sword of mine shall give them instant way 1652 ,</p>
<p>Where they shall rest forever. Trumpets, speak!</p>
<p>Draws</p>
<p>Alarums. Fights</p>
<p>Edmund falls</p>
<p>ALBANY Save him 1653 , save him!</p>
<p>GONERIL This is practice 1654 , Gloucester:</p>
<p>By th’law of war thou wast not bound to answer</p>
<p>An unknown opposite: thou art not vanquished,</p>
<p>But cozened and beguiled 1655 .</p>
<p>ALBANY Shut your mouth, dame 1656 ,</p>
<p>Or with this paper shall I stop it.— Hold, sir.—</p>
<p>Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.</p>
<p>To Goneril</p>
<p>No tearing, lady: I perceive you know 1657 it.</p>
<p>Shows her the letter</p>
<p>GONERIL Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:</p>
<p>Who can arraign 1658 me for’t.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>ALBANY Most monstrous! O, know’st thou this paper?</p>
<p>EDMUND Ask me not what I know.</p>
<p>ALBANY Go after her: she’s desperate: govern 1659 her.</p>
<p>[Exit a soldier ]</p>
<p>EDMUND What you have charged me with, that have I done,</p>
<p>And more, much more: the time will bring it out:</p>
<p>’Tis past and so am I.— But what art thou</p>
<p>To Edgar</p>
<p>That hast this fortune on 1660 me? If thou’rt noble,</p>
<p>I do forgive thee.</p>
<p>EDGAR Let’s exchange charity 1661 .</p>
<p>I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund:</p>
<p>If more, the more th’hast 1662 wronged me.</p>
<p>My name is Edgar, and thy father’s son.</p>
<p>Removes his helmet</p>
<p>The gods are just, and of our pleasant 1663 vices</p>
<p>Make instruments to plague us:</p>
<p>The dark 1664 and vicious 1665 place where thee he got 1666</p>
<p>Cost him his eyes.</p>
<p>EDMUND Th’hast spoken right: ’tis true,</p>
<p>The wheel 1667 is come full circle: I am here.</p>
<p>ALBANY Methought thy very gait did prophesy 1668</p>
<p>To Edgar</p>
<p>A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee.</p>
<p>Let sorrow split my heart if ever I</p>
<p>Did hate thee or thy father!</p>
<p>EDGAR Worthy prince, I know’t.</p>
<p>ALBANY Where have you hid yourself?</p>
<p>How have you known the miseries of your father?</p>
<p>EDGAR By nursing them, my lord. List 1669 a brief tale,</p>
<p>And when ’tis told, O, that my heart would burst!</p>
<p>The bloody proclamation 1670 to escape</p>
<p>That followed me so near — O, our lives’ sweetness!</p>
<p>That we the pain of death would hourly die 1671</p>
<p>Rather than die at once! — taught me to shift</p>
<p>Into a madman’s rags, t’assume a semblance 1672</p>
<p>That very dogs disdained: and in this habit 1673</p>
<p>Met I my father with his bleeding rings 1674 ,</p>
<p>Their precious stones new lost, became his guide,</p>
<p>Led him, begged for him, saved him from despair 1675 ,</p>
<p>Never — O, fault! — revealed myself unto him</p>
<p>Until some half-hour past, when I was armed.</p>
<p>Not sure, though hoping, of this good success 1676 ,</p>
<p>I asked his blessing, and from first to last</p>
<p>Told him our pilgrimage 1677 : but his flawed 1678 heart —</p>
<p>Alack, too weak the conflict to support —</p>
<p>’Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,</p>
<p>Burst smilingly.</p>
<p>EDMUND This speech of yours hath moved me,</p>
<p>And shall perchance do good: but speak you on:</p>
<p>You look as you had something more to say.</p>
<p>ALBANY If there be more, more woeful, hold it in,</p>
<p>For I am almost ready to dissolve 1679 ,</p>
<p>Hearing of this.</p>
<p>Enter a Gentleman</p>
<p>With a bloody knife</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Help, help, O, help!</p>
<p>EDGAR What kind of help?</p>
<p>ALBANY Speak, man.</p>
<p>EDGAR What means this bloody knife?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN ’Tis hot, it smokes 1680 :</p>
<p>It came even from the heart of — O, she’s dead!</p>
<p>ALBANY Who dead? Speak, man.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Your lady, sir, your lady; and her sister</p>
<p>By her is poisoned: she confesses it.</p>
<p>EDMUND I was contracted to them both: all three</p>
<p>Now marry in an instant.</p>
<p>EDGAR Here comes Kent.</p>
<p>Enter Kent</p>
<p>ALBANY Produce the bodies, be they alive or dead:</p>
<p>Goneril and Regan’s bodies brought out</p>
<p>This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble,</p>
<p>Touches us not with pity.— O, is this he?—</p>
<p>Sees Kent</p>
<p>The time will not allow the compliment 1681</p>
<p>To Kent</p>
<p>Which very manners urges.</p>
<p>KENT I am come</p>
<p>To bid my king and master aye 1682 goodnight:</p>
<p>Is he not here?</p>
<p>ALBANY Great thing 1683 of us forgot!</p>
<p>Speak, Edmund, where’s the king? And where’s Cordelia?—</p>
<p>See’st thou this object 1684 , Kent?</p>
<p>Points to the bodies</p>
<p>KENT Alack, why thus?</p>
<p>EDMUND Yet Edmund was beloved:</p>
<p>The one the other poisoned for my sake</p>
<p>And after slew herself.</p>
<p>ALBANY Even 1685 so. Cover their faces.</p>
<p>EDMUND I pant for life: some good I mean to do,</p>
<p>Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send —</p>
<p>Be brief in it — to th’castle, for my writ 1686</p>
<p>Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:</p>
<p>Nay, send in time.</p>
<p>ALBANY Run, run, O, run!</p>
<p>EDGAR To who, my lord? Who has the office 1687 ?</p>
<p>Send thy token of reprieve.</p>
<p>To Edmund</p>
<p>EDMUND Well thought on: take my sword,</p>
<p>Give it the captain.</p>
<p>EDGAR Haste thee, for thy life.</p>
<p>To a Gentleman</p>
<p>[Exit Gentleman ]</p>
<p>EDMUND He hath commission from thy wife and me</p>
<p>To hang Cordelia in the prison and</p>

<p>To Edgar and Kent</p>
<p>With boot 1710 and such addition 1711 as your honours</p>
<p>Have more than merited. All friends shall taste</p>

<p>LEAR And my poor fool 1714 is hanged! No, no, no life?</p>
<p>Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life,</p>
<p>And thou no breath at all? Thou’lt come no more,</p>
<p>Never, never, never, never, never!</p>
<p>Pray you undo this button 1715 : thank you, sir 1716 .</p>

<p>That would upon the rack 1718 of this tough world</p>
<p>Stretch him out longer 1719 .</p>
<p>EDGAR He is gone, indeed.</p>
<p>KENT The wonder is he hath endured so long:</p>
<p>He but usurped 1720 his life.</p>
<p>ALBANY Bear them from hence. Our present business</p>
<p>Is general woe.—</p>
<p>Friends of my soul, you twain</p>
<p>To Kent and Edgar</p>
<p>Rule in this realm, and the gored 1721 state sustain 1722 .</p>
<p>KENT I have a journey 1723 , sir, shortly to go:</p>
<p>My master calls me, I must not say no.</p>
<p>EDGAR The weight of this sad time we must obey:</p>
<p>Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.</p>
<p>The oldest hath borne most: we that are young</p>
<p>Shall never see so much nor live so long.</p>

<p>Following 1.2 here :</p>
<p>EDMUND Nor is not, sure.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him.
Heaven and earth!</p>
<p>Following 1.2 here :</p>
<p>as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent, death, dearth,
dissolutions of ancient amities, divisions in state, menaces and
maledictions against king and nobles, needless diffidences, banishment
of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not
what.</p>
<p>EDGAR How long have you been a sectary astronomical?</p>
<p>EDMUND Come, come,</p>
<p>Following 1.3: here</p>
<p>Not to be overruled. Idle old man,</p>
<p>That still would manage those authorities</p>
<p>That he hath given away! Now by my life</p>
<p>Old fools are babes again, and must be used</p>
<p>With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abused.</p>
<p>Following 1.4: here</p>
<p>FOOL That lord that counselled thee to give away thy land,</p>
<p>Come place him here by me, do thou for him stand,</p>
<p>The sweet and bitter fool will presently appear:</p>
<p>The one in motley here, the other found out there.</p>
<p>LEAR Dost thou call me fool, boy?</p>
<p>FOOL All thy other titles thou hast given away, that thou wast born
with.</p>
<p>KENT This is not altogether fool my lord.</p>
<p>FOOL No, faith, lords and great men will not let me, if I had a
monopoly out, they would have part on’t: and ladies too, they will not
let me have all the fool to myself, they’ll be snatching.</p>
<p>Following 1.4: here</p>
<p>I would learn that, for by the marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and
reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters.</p>
<p>FOOL Which they will make an obedient father.</p>
<p>Following 2.2: here</p>
<p>His fault is much, and the good king, his master,</p>
<p>Will check him for’t: your purposed low correction</p>
<p>Is such as basest and ’temnest wretches</p>
<p>For pilf ’rings and most common trespasses</p>
<p>Are punished with.</p>
<p>Following 3.1: here</p>
<p>tears his white hair,</p>
<p>Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage</p>
<p>Catch in their fury, and make nothing of,</p>
<p>Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn,</p>
<p>The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain:</p>
<p>This night wherein the cubdrawn bear would couch,</p>
<p>The lion and the belly-pinchèd wolf</p>
<p>Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,</p>
<p>And bids what will take all.</p>
<p>Replaces 3.1: here</p>
<p>But true it is, from France there comes a power</p>
<p>Into this scattered kingdom, who already</p>
<p>Wise in our negligence, have secret feet</p>
<p>In some of our best ports, and are at point</p>
<p>To show their open banner.</p>
<p>Now to you:</p>
<p>If on my credit you dare build so far</p>
<p>To make your speed to Dover, you shall find</p>
<p>Some that will thank you, making just report</p>
<p>Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow</p>
<p>The king hath cause to ’plain.</p>
<p>I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,</p>
<p>And from some knowledge and assurance,</p>
<p>Offer this office to you.</p>
<p>Following 3.6: here</p>
<p>EDGAR The foul fiend bites my back.</p>
<p>FOOL He’s mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse’s
health, a boy’s love, or a whore’s oath.</p>
<p>LEAR It shall be done, I will arraign them straight,</p>
<p>Come sit thou here most learnèd justice.—</p>
<p>To Edgar</p>
<p>Thou, sapient sir sit here.</p>
<p>To the Fool</p>
<p>No, you she foxes—</p>
<p>EDGAR Look where he stands and glares. Want’st thou eyes at trial,
madam?</p>
<p>Come o’er the bourn, Bessy, to me—</p>
<p>FOOL Her boat hath a leak,</p>
<p>Sings</p>
<p>And she must not speak</p>
<p>Why she dares not come over to thee.</p>
<p>EDGAR The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale,
Hopdance cries in Tom’s belly for two white herring,</p>
<p>Croak not black angel, I have no food for thee.</p>
<p>KENT How do you sir? Stand you not so amazed,</p>
<p>Will you lie down and rest upon the cushings?</p>
<p>LEAR I’ll see their trial first, bring in their evidence.—</p>
<p>Thou robèd man of justice, take thy place—</p>
<p>To Edgar</p>
<p>And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,</p>
<p>To the Fool</p>
<p>Bench by his side:— you are o’th’commission,</p>
<p>To Kent</p>
<p>Sit you too.</p>
<p>EDGAR Let us deal justly.</p>
<p>Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?</p>
<p>Thy sheep be in the corn,</p>
<p>And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,</p>
<p>Thy sheep shall take no harm.</p>
<p>Purr, the cat is grey.</p>
<p>LEAR Arraign her first, ’tis Goneril. I here take my oath before this
honourable assembly, she kicked the poor king her father.</p>
<p>FOOL Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?</p>
<p>LEAR She cannot deny it.</p>
<p>FOOL Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.</p>
<p>LEAR And here’s another whose warped looks proclaim</p>
<p>What store her heart is made on: stop her there!</p>
<p>Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!</p>
<p>False justicer, why hast thou let her scape?</p>
<p>Following 3.6: here</p>
<p>KENT Oppressed nature sleeps:</p>
<p>This rest might yet have balmed thy broken sinews,</p>
<p>Which, if convenience will not allow,</p>
<p>Stand in hard cure.—</p>
<p>Come help</p>
<p>To Fool</p>
<p>to bear thy master:</p>
<p>Thou must not stay behind.</p>
<p>Exeunt. [Edgar remains ]</p>
<p>EDGAR When we our betters see bearing our woes,</p>
<p>We scarcely think our miseries our foes.</p>
<p>Who alone suffers, suffers most i’th’mind,</p>
<p>Leaving free things and happy shows behind,</p>
<p>But then the mind much sufferance doth o’erskip,</p>
<p>When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship:</p>
<p>How light and portable my pain seems now,</p>
<p>When that which makes me bend, makes the king bow:</p>
<p>He childed as I fathered. Tom away!</p>
<p>Mark the high noises and thyself bewray</p>
<p>When false opinion, whose wrong thoughts defile thee,</p>
<p>In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.</p>
<p>What will hap more tonight, safe scape the king:</p>
<p>Lurk, lurk.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Following 3.7: here</p>
<p>SERVANT I’ll never care what wickedness I do,</p>
<p>If this man come to good.</p>
<p>SECOND SERVANT If she live long,</p>
<p>And in the end meet the old course of death,</p>
<p>Women will all turn monsters.</p>
<p>FIRST SERVANT Let’s follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam</p>
<p>To lead him where he would: his madness</p>
<p>Allows itself to anything.</p>
<p>SECOND SERVANT Go thou: I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs</p>
<p>To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!</p>
<p>Following 4.1: here</p>
<p>Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once: of lust, as Obidicut,
Hobbididence, prince of dumbness, Mahu of stealing, Modo of murder,
Flibbertigibbet of mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids
and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master</p>
<p>Following 4.2: here</p>
<p>I fear your disposition:</p>
<p>That nature, which contemns i’th’origin</p>
<p>Cannot be bordered certain in itself.</p>
<p>She that herself will sliver and disbranch</p>
<p>From her material sap perforce must wither</p>
<p>And come to deadly use.</p>
<p>GONERIL No more, the text is foolish.</p>
<p>ALBANY Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:</p>
<p>Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?</p>
<p>Tigers, not daughters, what have you performed?</p>
<p>A father, and a gracious agèd man,</p>
<p>Whose reverence even the head-lugged bear would lick,</p>
<p>Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.</p>
<p>Could my good brother suffer you to do it?</p>
<p>A man, a prince, by him so benefited!</p>
<p>If that the heavens do not their visible spirits</p>
<p>Send quickly down to tame the vile offences, it will come,</p>
<p>Humanity must perforce prey on itself,</p>
<p>Like monsters of the deep.</p>
<p>Following 4.2 here :</p>
<p>that not know’st</p>
<p>Fools do those villains pity who are punished</p>
<p>Ere they have done their mischief. Where’s thy drum?</p>
<p>France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,</p>
<p>With plumèd helm, thy state begins threat,</p>
<p>Whilst thou, a moral fool, sits still and cries</p>
<p>‘Alack, why does he so?’</p>
<p>Following 4.2 here :</p>
<p>ALBANY Thou changèd and self-covered thing, for shame</p>
<p>Bemonster not thy feature. Were’t my fitness</p>
<p>To let these hands obey my blood,</p>
<p>They are apt enough to dislocate and tear</p>
<p>Thy flesh and bones: howe’er thou art a fiend,</p>
<p>A woman’s shape doth shield thee.</p>
<p>GONERIL Marry, your manhood mew—</p>
<p>Enter a Gentleman</p>
<p>ALBANY What news?</p>
<p>Following 4.2 here :</p>
<p>Enter Kent and a Gentleman</p>
<p>KENT Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back, know you no
reason?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his
coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much fear
and anger that his personal return was most required and necessary.</p>
<p>KENT Who hath he left behind him general?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.</p>
<p>KENT Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of
grief?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Ay, sir, she took them, read them in my presence,</p>
<p>And now and then an ample tear trilled down</p>
<p>Her delicate cheek: it seemed she was a queen over</p>
<p>Her passion, who, most rebel-like,</p>
<p>Sought to be king o’er her.</p>
<p>KENT O, then it moved her.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove</p>
<p>Who should express her goodliest. You have seen</p>
<p>Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears</p>
<p>Were like a better way: those happy smilets,</p>
<p>That played on her ripe lip seem not to know</p>
<p>What guests were in her eyes, which, parted thence,</p>
<p>As pearls from diamonds dropped. In brief,</p>
<p>Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,</p>
<p>If all could so become it.</p>
<p>KENT Made she no verbal question?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of ‘father’</p>
<p>Pantingly forth, as if it pressed her heart:</p>
<p>Cried ’Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies, sisters!</p>
<p>Kent, father, sisters! What, i’th’storm, i’th’night?</p>
<p>Let pity not be believed!’ There she shook</p>
<p>The holy water from her heavenly eyes,</p>
<p>And clamour moistened her: then away she started</p>
<p>To deal with grief alone.</p>
<p>KENT It is the stars,</p>
<p>The stars above us, govern our conditions,</p>
<p>Else one self mate and make could not beget</p>
<p>Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN No.</p>
<p>KENT Was this before the king returned?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN No, since.</p>
<p>KENT Well, sir, the poor distressèd Lear’s i’th’town;</p>
<p>Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers</p>
<p>What we are come about, and by no means</p>
<p>Will yield to see his daughter.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Why, good sir?</p>
<p>KENT A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,</p>
<p>That stripped her from his benediction, turned her</p>
<p>To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights</p>
<p>To his dog-hearted daughters: these things sting</p>
<p>His mind so venomously, that burning shame</p>
<p>Detains him from Cordelia.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Alack, poor gentleman!</p>
<p>KENT Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN ’Tis so, they are afoot.</p>
<p>KENT Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear,</p>
<p>And leave you to attend him: some dear cause</p>
<p>Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.</p>
<p>When I am known aright, you shall not grieve</p>
<p>Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you go</p>
<p>Along with me.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Following 4.6 here :</p>
<p>CORDELIA Very well.</p>
<p>DOCTOR Please you, draw near.— Louder the music there!</p>
<p>Following 4.6 here :</p>
<p>To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder,</p>
<p>In the most terrible and nimble stroke</p>
<p>Of quick cross lightning? To watch — poor perdu ! —</p>
<p>With this thin helm?</p>
<p>Following 4.6 here :</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so
slain?</p>
<p>KENT Most certain, sir.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN Who is conductor of his people?</p>
<p>KENT As ’tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl of Kent
in Germany.</p>
<p>KENT Report is changeable. ’Tis time to look about: the powers of the
kingdom approach apace.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN The arbitrament is like to be bloody. Fare you well,
sir.</p>
<p>KENT My point and period will be throughly wrought,</p>
<p>Or well or ill, as this day’s battle’s fought.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Following 5.1 here :</p>
<p>EDMUND That thought abuses you.</p>
<p>REGAN I am doubtful that you have been conjunct And bosomed with her,
as far as we call hers.</p>
<p>Following 5.1 here :</p>
<p>GONERIL I had rather lose the battle than that sister Should loosen
him and me.</p>
<p>Following 5.1 here :</p>
<p>Where I could not be honest,</p>
<p>I never yet was valiant. For this business,</p>
<p>It touches us as France invades our land,</p>
<p>Not bolds the king, with others whom I fear,</p>
<p>Most just and heavy causes make oppose.</p>
<p>EDMUND Sir, you speak nobly.</p>
<p>Following 5.3 here :</p>
<p>At this time</p>
<p>We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;</p>
<p>And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed</p>
<p>By those that feel their sharpness:</p>
<p>The question of Cordelia and her father</p>
<p>Requires a fitter place.</p>
<p>Following 5.3 here :</p>
<p>EDGAR This would have seemed a period</p>
<p>To such as love not sorrow, but another,</p>
<p>To amplify too much, would make much more,</p>
<p>And top extremity.</p>
<p>Whilst I was big in clamour, came there in a man,</p>
<p>Who, having seen me in my worst estate,</p>
<p>Shunned my abhorred society, but then finding</p>
<p>Who ’twas that so endured, with his strong arms</p>
<p>He fastened on my neck and bellowed out</p>
<p>As he’d burst heaven, threw me on my father,</p>
<p>Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him</p>
<p>That ever ear received, which in recounting</p>
<p>His grief grew puissant and the strings of life</p>
<p>Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,</p>
<p>And there I left him ’tranced.</p>
<p>ALBANY But who was this?</p>
<p>EDGAR Kent, sir, the banished Kent, who in disguise</p>
<p>Followed his enemy king and did him service</p>
<p>Improper for a slave.</p>
