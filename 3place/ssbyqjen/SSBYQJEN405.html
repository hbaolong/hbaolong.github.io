<h4 id="scene-5-running-scene-14">Scene 5 ／ running scene 14</h4>
<p>Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft</p>
<p>JULIET Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.</p>
<p>It was the nightingale, and not the lark,</p>
<p>That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;</p>
<p>Nightly she sings on yon pom’granate tree.</p>
<p>Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.</p>
<p>ROMEO It was the lark, the herald of the morn,</p>
<p>No nightingale: look, love, what envious 953 streaks</p>
<p>Do lace the severing 954 clouds in yonder east:</p>
<p>Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund 955 day</p>
<p>Stands tiptoe on the misty mountains tops.</p>
<p>I must be gone and live or stay and die.</p>
<p>JULIET Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I:</p>
<p>It is some meteor that the sun exhales 956 ,</p>
<p>To be to thee this night a torchbearer,</p>
<p>And light thee on thy way to Mantua.</p>
<p>Therefore stay yet: thou need’st not to be gone.</p>
<p>ROMEO Let me be ta’en 957 , let me be put to death,</p>
<p>I am content, so 958 thou wilt have it so.</p>
<p>I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,</p>
<p>’Tis but the pale reflex 959 of Cynthia’s 960 brow,</p>
<p>Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat</p>
<p>The vaulty 961 heaven so high above our heads.</p>
<p>I have more care 962 to stay than will to go:</p>
<p>Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.</p>
<p>How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk, it is not day.</p>
<p>JULIET It is, it is: hie 963 hence, begone, away!</p>
<p>It is the lark that sings so out of tune,</p>
<p>Straining 964 harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.</p>
<p>Some say the lark makes sweet division 965 ;</p>
<p>This doth not so, for she divideth us:</p>
<p>Some say the lark and loathèd toad change 966 eyes,</p>
<p>O, now I would they had changed voices too,</p>
<p>Since arm from arm 967 that voice doth us affray 968 ,</p>
<p>Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up 969 to the day.</p>
<p>O, now begone, more light and light it grows.</p>
<p>ROMEO More light and light, more dark and dark our woes!</p>
<p>Enter Nurse</p>
<p>NURSE Madam!</p>
<p>JULIET Nurse?</p>
<p>NURSE Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:</p>
<p>The day is broke, be wary, look about.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>JULIET Then, window, let day in, and let life out.</p>
<p>ROMEO Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I’ll descend.</p>
<p>JULIET Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay, husband, friend 970 ,</p>
<p>I must hear from thee every day in the hour,</p>
<p>For in a minute there are many days.</p>
<p>O, by this count I shall be much in years 971</p>
<p>Ere I again behold my Romeo!</p>
<p>ROMEO Farewell!</p>
<p>I will omit no opportunity</p>
<p>That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.</p>
<p>JULIET O, think’st thou we shall ever meet again?</p>
<p>ROMEO I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve</p>
<p>For sweet discourses in our time to come.</p>
<p>JULIET O God, I have an ill-divining 972 soul!</p>
<p>Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,</p>
<p>As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:</p>
<p>Either my eyesight fails or thou look’st pale.</p>
<p>ROMEO And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:</p>
<p>Dry 973 sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>JULIET O fortune, fortune, all men call thee fickle:</p>
<p>If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.</p>
<p>That is renowned for faith? Be fickle, fortune,</p>
<p>For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long,</p>
<p>But send him back.</p>
<p>Enter Mother</p>
<p>Below</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET Ho, daughter, are you up?</p>
<p>JULIET Who is’t that calls? It is my lady mother.</p>
<p>Is she not down so late 974 , or up so early?</p>
<p>What unaccustomed cause procures 975 her hither?</p>
<p>Juliet could exit aloft and enter below</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET Why, how now, Juliet!</p>
<p>JULIET Madam, I am not well.</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?</p>
<p>What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?</p>
<p>An if 976 thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live:</p>
<p>Therefore, have done. Some grief shows much of love,</p>
<p>But much of grief shows still some want of wit.</p>
<p>JULIET Yet let me weep for such a feeling 977 loss.</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET So shall you feel 978 the loss, but not the friend
979</p>
<p>Which you weep for.</p>
<p>JULIET Feeling so the loss,</p>
<p>I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death,</p>
<p>As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.</p>
<p>JULIET What villain, madam?</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET That same villain, Romeo.</p>
<p>JULIET Villain and he be many miles asunder.—</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>God pardon him! I do with all my heart:</p>
<p>And yet no man like 980 he doth grieve 981 my heart.</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET That is because the traitor lives.</p>
<p>JULIET Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:</p>
<p>Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death!</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:</p>
<p>Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,</p>
<p>Where that same banished runagate 982 doth live,</p>
<p>Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram 983 ,</p>
<p>That he shall soon keep Tybalt company,</p>
<p>And then I hope, thou wilt be satisfied 984 .</p>
<p>JULIET Indeed, I never shall be satisfied</p>
<p>With Romeo, till I behold him — dead 985 —</p>
<p>Is my poor heart so for a kinsman 986 vexed.</p>
<p>Madam, if you could find out but a man</p>
<p>To bear a poison, I would temper 987 it,</p>
<p>That Romeo should upon receipt thereof,</p>
<p>Soon sleep in quiet 988 . O, how my heart abhors</p>
<p>To hear him named and cannot come to him,</p>
<p>To wreak 989 the love I bore my cousin</p>
<p>Upon his body that hath slaughtered him!</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.</p>
<p>But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.</p>
<p>JULIET And joy comes well in such a needy 990 time:</p>
<p>What are they, beseech your ladyship?</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET Well, well, thou hast a careful 991 father, child,</p>
<p>One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,</p>
<p>Hath sorted out 992 a sudden day of joy,</p>
<p>That thou expects not, nor I looked not for 993 .</p>
<p>JULIET Madam, in happy time 994 , what day is that?</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET Marry 995 , my child, early next Thursday morn,</p>
<p>The gallant, young and noble gentleman,</p>
<p>The County Paris, at St Peter’s Church,</p>
<p>Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.</p>
<p>JULIET Now, by St Peter’s Church and Peter too,</p>
<p>He shall not make me there a joyful bride.</p>
<p>I wonder at this haste, that I must wed</p>
<p>Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.</p>
<p>I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,</p>
<p>I will not marry yet, and, when I do, I swear</p>
<p>It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,</p>
<p>Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET Here comes your father: tell him so yourself,</p>
<p>And see how he will take it at your hands.</p>
<p>Enter Capulet and Nurse</p>
<p>CAPULET When the sun sets, the earth doth drizzle dew,</p>
<p>But for the sunset of my brother’s son</p>
<p>It rains downright.</p>
<p>How now? A conduit 996 , girl? What, still in tears?</p>
<p>Evermore show’ring? In one little body</p>
<p>Thou counterfeits 997 a bark 998 , a sea, a wind,</p>
<p>For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,</p>
<p>Do ebb and flow with tears: the bark thy body is,</p>
<p>Sailing in this salt flood 999 : the winds, thy sighs,</p>
<p>Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,</p>
<p>Without a sudden calm, will overset 1000</p>
<p>Thy tempest-tossèd body. How now, wife?</p>
<p>Have you delivered to her our decree?</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET Ay, sir, but she will none, she gives you thanks.</p>
<p>I would 1001 the fool were married to her grave.</p>
<p>CAPULET Soft, take me with you 1002 , take me with you, wife.</p>
<p>How 1003 , will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?</p>
<p>Is she not proud? Doth she not count her 1004 blest,</p>
<p>Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought 1005</p>
<p>So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?</p>
<p>JULIET Not proud you have, but thankful that you have:</p>
<p>Proud can I never be of what I hate,</p>
<p>But thankful even for hate, that is meant love 1006 .</p>
<p>CAPULET How now? How now? Chopped-logic 1007 ? What is this?</p>
<p>‘Proud’ and ‘I thank you’ and ‘I thank you not’,</p>
<p>And yet ‘not proud’, mistress minion you?</p>
<p>Thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds,</p>
<p>But fettle 1008 your fine joints gainst Thursday next,</p>
<p>To go with Paris to St Peter’s Church,</p>
<p>Or I will drag thee on a hurdle 1009 thither.</p>
<p>Out 1010 , you green-sickness 1011 carrion 1012 , out, you
baggage,</p>
<p>You tallow-face 1013 !</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET Fie, fie, what, are you mad?</p>
<p>JULIET Good father, I beseech you on my knees,</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>Hear me with patience but to speak a word.</p>
<p>CAPULET Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch!</p>
<p>I tell thee what: get thee to church o’Thursday,</p>
<p>Or never after look me in the face.</p>
<p>Speak not, reply not, do not answer me:</p>
<p>My fingers itch 1014 . Wife, we scarce thought us blest</p>
<p>That God had lent us but this only child,</p>
<p>But now I see this one is one too much,</p>
<p>And that we have a curse in having her.</p>
<p>Out on her, hilding 1015 !</p>
<p>NURSE God in heaven bless her!</p>
<p>You are to blame, my lord, to rate 1016 her so.</p>
<p>CAPULET And why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,</p>
<p>To Nurse</p>
<p>Good prudence, smatter 1017 with your gossips 1018 , go.</p>
<p>NURSE I speak no treason.</p>
<p>CAPULET O, God gi’ good e’en 1019 .</p>
<p>NURSE May not one speak?</p>
<p>CAPULET Peace, you mumbling fool!</p>
<p>Utter your gravity 1020 o’er a gossip’s bowl 1021 ,</p>
<p>For here we need it not.</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET You are too hot.</p>
<p>CAPULET God’s bread 1022 , it makes me mad!</p>
<p>Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,</p>
<p>Alone, in company, still 1023 my care hath been</p>
<p>To have her matched: and having now provided</p>
<p>A gentleman of noble parentage,</p>
<p>Of fair demesnes 1024 , youthful, and nobly allied,</p>
<p>Stuffed, as they say, with honourable parts 1025 ,</p>
<p>Proportioned as one’s thought would wish a man,</p>
<p>And then to have a wretched puling 1026 fool,</p>
<p>A whining mammet 1027 , in her fortune’s tender 1028 ,</p>
<p>To answer ’I’ll not wed, I cannot love,</p>
<p>I am too young, I pray you pardon 1029 me.’</p>
<p>But, an you will not wed, I’ll pardon you:</p>
<p>Graze where you will you shall not house with me.</p>
<p>Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest 1030 .</p>
<p>Thursday is near, lay hand on heart, advise 1031 :</p>
<p>An you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend,</p>
<p>An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,</p>
<p>For, by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,</p>
<p>Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.</p>
<p>Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be forsworn 1032 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>JULIET Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,</p>
<p>That sees into the bottom of my grief?</p>
<p>O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!</p>
<p>Delay this marriage for a month, a week,</p>
<p>Or if you do not, make the bridal bed</p>
<p>In that dim monument 1033 where Tybalt lies.</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word:</p>
<p>Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>JULIET O God!— O nurse, how shall this be prevented?</p>
<p>My husband is on earth, my faith 1034 in heaven:</p>
<p>How shall that faith return again to earth,</p>
<p>Unless that husband send it me from heaven</p>
<p>By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.</p>
<p>Alack, alack, that heaven should practise 1035 stratagems</p>
<p>Upon so soft a subject as myself!</p>
<p>What say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?</p>
<p>Some comfort, nurse.</p>
<p>NURSE Faith, here it is:</p>
<p>Romeo is banished, and all the world to nothing 1036 ,</p>
<p>That he dares ne’er come back to challenge 1037 you,</p>
<p>Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.</p>
<p>Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,</p>
<p>I think it best you married with the county.</p>
<p>O, he’s a lovely gentleman!</p>
<p>Romeo’s a dishclout 1038 to him. An eagle, madam,</p>
<p>Hath not so green, so quick 1039 , so fair an eye</p>
<p>As Paris hath. Beshrew 1040 my very heart,</p>
<p>I think you are happy in this second match,</p>
<p>For it excels your first: or if it did not,</p>
<p>Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,</p>
<p>As living here and you no use 1041 of him.</p>
<p>JULIET Speakest thou from thy heart?</p>
<p>NURSE And from my soul too,</p>
<p>Or else beshrew them both.</p>
<p>JULIET Amen 1042 .</p>
<p>NURSE What?</p>
<p>JULIET Well, thou hast comforted me marv’llous much.</p>
<p>Go in and tell my lady I am gone,</p>
<p>Having displeased my father, to Laurence’ cell,</p>
<p>To make confession and to be absolved.</p>
<p>NURSE Marry, I will, and this is wisely done.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>JULIET Ancient damnation! 1043 O most wicked fiend!</p>
<p>Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn 1044 ,</p>
<p>Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue</p>
<p>Which she hath praised him with above compare</p>
<p>So many thousand times? Go, counsellor,</p>
<p>Thou and my bosom 1045 henceforth shall be twain 1046 .</p>
<p>I’ll to the friar, to know his remedy:</p>
<p>If all else fail, myself have power to die.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
