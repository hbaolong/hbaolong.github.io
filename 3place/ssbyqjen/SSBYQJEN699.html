9</h4>
<p>Enter the King, Prince of Wales and others</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Lords, give us leave 1134 . The Prince of Wales and
I</p>
<p>Must have some private conference. But be near at hand,</p>
<p>For we shall presently have need of you.</p>
<p>Exeunt Lords</p>
<p>I know not whether heaven will have it so,</p>
<p>For some displeasing service I have done,</p>
<p>That in his secret doom 1135 , out of my blood 1136</p>
<p>He’ll breed revengement and a scourge 1137 for me.</p>
<p>But thou dost in thy passages 1138 of life</p>
<p>Make me believe that thou art only marked</p>
<p>For 1139 the hot vengeance and the rod 1140 of heaven</p>
<p>To punish my mistreadings 1141 . Tell me else 1142 ,</p>
<p>Could such inordinate 1143 and low desires,</p>
<p>Such poor, such bare 1144 , such lewd 1145 , such mean attempts 1146
,</p>
<p>Such barren pleasures, rude society 1147 ,</p>
<p>As thou art matched withal 1148 and grafted 1149 to,</p>
<p>Accompany the greatness of thy blood</p>
<p>And hold their level 1150 with thy princely heart?</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY So please your majesty, I would I could</p>
<p>Quit 1151 all offences with as clear 1152 excuse</p>
<p>As well as I am doubtless 1153 I can purge</p>
<p>Myself of many I am charged withal:</p>
<p>Yet such extenuation let me beg,</p>
<p>As, in reproof 1154 of many tales devised,</p>
<p>Which oft the ear of greatness 1155 needs must hear</p>
<p>By smiling pick-thanks 1156 and base news-mongers 1157 ,</p>
<p>I may, for some things true 1158 , wherein my youth</p>
<p>Hath faulty wand’red and irregular 1159 ,</p>
<p>Find pardon on my true submission 1160 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Heaven pardon thee! Yet let me wonder 1161 , Harry,</p>
<p>At thy affections 1162 , which do hold a wing 1163</p>
<p>Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.</p>
<p>Thy place in council thou hast rudely 1164 lost,</p>
<p>Which by thy younger brother is supplied 1165 ,</p>
<p>And art almost an alien 1166 to the hearts</p>
<p>Of all the court and princes of my blood.</p>
<p>The hope and expectation of thy time 1167</p>
<p>Is ruined, and the soul of every man</p>
<p>Prophetically do forethink 1168 thy fall.</p>
<p>Had I so lavish of my presence been,</p>
<p>So common-hackneyed 1169 in the eyes of men,</p>
<p>So stale and cheap to vulgar company,</p>
<p>Opinion 1170 , that did help me to the crown,</p>
<p>Had still kept loyal to possession 1171</p>
<p>And left me in reputeless 1172 banishment,</p>
<p>A fellow of no mark 1173 nor likelihood 1174 .</p>
<p>By being seldom seen, I could not stir</p>
<p>But like a comet I was wondered at,</p>
<p>That men would tell their children, ‘This is he.’</p>
<p>Others would say, ‘Where? Which is Bullingbrook?’</p>
<p>And then I stole all courtesy from heaven 1175 ,</p>
<p>And dressed myself in such humility</p>
<p>That I did pluck allegiance from men’s hearts,</p>
<p>Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,</p>
<p>Even in the presence of the crownèd king.</p>
<p>Thus I did keep my person fresh and new;</p>
<p>My presence, like a robe pontifical 1176 ,</p>
<p>Ne’er seen but wondered at: and so my state 1177 ,</p>
<p>Seldom 1178 but sumptuous, showed like a feast 1179</p>
<p>And won by rareness such solemnity 1180 .</p>
<p>The skipping 1181 king, he ambled up and down 1182</p>
<p>With shallow jesters and rash bavin 1183 1184 wits,</p>
<p>Soon kindled and soon burnt, carded his state 1185 ,</p>
<p>Mingled his royalty with carping 1186 fools,</p>
<p>Had his great name profanèd with their scorns 1187</p>
<p>And gave his countenance, against his name 1188 ,</p>
<p>To laugh at gibing 1189 boys and stand the push 1190</p>
<p>Of every beardless vain comparative 1191 ;</p>
<p>Grew a companion to the common streets,</p>
<p>Enfeoffed 1192 himself to popularity,</p>
<p>That, being daily swallowed by men’s eyes,</p>
<p>They surfeited 1193 with honey and began</p>
<p>To loathe the taste of sweetness 1194 , whereof a little</p>
<p>More than a little is by much too much.</p>
<p>So when he had occasion to be seen,</p>
<p>He was but as the cuckoo is in June 1195 ,</p>
<p>Heard, not regarded, seen, but with such eyes</p>
<p>As, sick and blunted with community 1196 ,</p>
<p>Afford no extraordinary gaze 1197 ,</p>
<p>Such as is bent on sun-like majesty</p>
<p>When it shines seldom in admiring eyes.</p>
<p>But rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down,</p>
<p>Slept in his face 1198 and rendered such aspect 1199</p>
<p>As cloudy 1200 men use to 1201 do to their adversaries,</p>
<p>Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.</p>
<p>And in that very line 1202 , Harry, standest thou,</p>
<p>For thou hast lost thy princely privilege</p>
<p>With vile participation 1203 . Not an eye</p>
<p>But is a-weary of thy common 1204 sight,</p>
<p>Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more,</p>
<p>Which now doth that I would not have it do,</p>
<p>Make blind itself with foolish tenderness 1205 .</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY I shall hereafter, my thrice-gracious lord,</p>
<p>Be more myself 1206 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV For all the world 1207</p>
<p>As thou art to this hour was Richard then,</p>
<p>When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,</p>
<p>And even as I was then is Percy now.</p>
<p>Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,</p>
<p>He hath more worthy interest to the state 1208</p>
<p>Than thou, the shadow of succession 1209 ;</p>
<p>For of 1210 no right, nor colour like to 1211 right,</p>
<p>He doth fill fields with harness 1212 in the realm,</p>
<p>Turns head 1213 against the lion’s 1214 armèd jaws,</p>
<p>And, being no more in debt to years 1215 than thou,</p>
<p>Leads ancient 1216 lords and reverend bishops on</p>
<p>To bloody battles and to bruising 1217 arms.</p>
<p>What never-dying honour hath he got</p>
<p>Against renownèd Douglas, whose 1218 high 1219 deeds,</p>
<p>Whose hot incursions 1220 and great name in arms</p>
<p>Holds from all soldiers chief majority</p>
<p>And military title capital 1221</p>
<p>Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ!</p>
<p>Thrice hath the Hotspur, Mars 1222 in swaddling clothes 1223 ,</p>
<p>This infant warrior, in his enterprises 1224</p>
<p>Discomfited 1225 great Douglas, ta’en him once 1226 ,</p>
<p>Enlargèd 1227 him and made a friend of him,</p>
<p>To fill the mouth of deep defiance up 1228</p>
<p>And shake the peace and safety of our throne.</p>
<p>And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,</p>
<p>The archbishop’s grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,</p>
<p>Capitulate 1229 against us and are up 1230 .</p>
<p>But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?</p>
<p>Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,</p>
<p>Which art my near’st and dearest 1231 enemy?</p>
<p>Thou that art like 1232 enough, through vassal 1233 fear,</p>
<p>Base inclination 1234 and the start of spleen 1235 ,</p>
<p>To fight against me under Percy’s pay,</p>
<p>To dog his heels and curtsy 1236 at his frowns,</p>
<p>To show how much thou art degenerate.</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY Do not think so. You shall not find it so.</p>
<p>And heaven forgive them that so much have swayed</p>
<p>Your majesty’s good thoughts away from me!</p>
<p>I will redeem all this on Percy’s head 1237</p>
<p>And in the closing of some glorious day 1238</p>
<p>Be bold to tell you that I am your son,</p>
<p>When I will wear a garment all of blood</p>
<p>And stain my favours 1239 in a bloody mask 1240 ,</p>
<p>Which, washed away, shall scour 1241 my shame with it.</p>
<p>And that shall be the day, whene’er it lights 1242 ,</p>
<p>That this same child of honour and renown,</p>
<p>This gallant Hotspur, this all-praisèd knight,</p>
<p>And your unthought-of 1243 Harry chance to meet.</p>
<p>For every honour sitting on his helm 1244 ,</p>
<p>Would they were multitudes, and on my head</p>
<p>My shames redoubled! For the time will come,</p>
<p>That I shall make this northern youth exchange</p>
<p>His glorious deeds for my indignities.</p>
<p>Percy is but my factor 1245 , good my lord,</p>
<p>To engross up 1246 glorious deeds on my behalf,</p>
<p>And I will call him to so strict account,</p>
<p>That he shall render every glory up,</p>
<p>Yea, even the slightest worship of his time 1247 ,</p>
<p>Or I will tear the reckoning 1248 from his heart.</p>
<p>This, in the name of heaven, I promise here:</p>
<p>The which if I perform and do survive</p>
<p>I do beseech your majesty may salve 1249</p>
<p>The long-grown wounds of my intemperature 1250 .</p>
<p>If not, the end of life cancels all bonds,</p>
<p>And I will die a hundred thousand deaths</p>
<p>Ere break the smallest parcel 1251 of this vow.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV A hundred thousand rebels die in this:</p>
<p>Thou shalt have charge 1252 and sovereign 1253 trust herein.</p>
<p>Enter Blunt</p>
<p>How now, good Blunt? Thy looks are full of speed 1254 .</p>
<p>BLUNT So hath the business that I come to speak of.</p>
<p>Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word</p>
<p>That Douglas and the English rebels met</p>
<p>The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>A mighty and a fearful head 1255 they are,</p>
<p>If promises be kept on every hand 1256 ,</p>
<p>As ever offered foul play in a state.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV The Earl of Westmorland set forth today,</p>
<p>With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster,</p>
<p>For this advertisement 1257 is five days old.</p>
<p>On Wednesday next, Harry, thou shalt set forward:</p>
<p>On Thursday we ourselves will march.</p>
<p>Our meeting is Bridgnorth 1258 , and, Harry, you shall march</p>
<p>Through Gloucestershire, by which account,</p>
<p>Our business valuèd 1259 , some twelve days hence</p>
<p>Our general forces at Bridgnorth shall meet.</p>
<p>Our hands are full of business: let’s away.</p>
<p>Advantage feeds him fat 1260 while men delay.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
