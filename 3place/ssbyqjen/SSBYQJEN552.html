<h4 id="scene-1-514-running-scene-4">Scene 1 514 / running scene 4</h4>
<p>Enter Montano and two Gentlemen</p>
<p>MONTANO What from the cape 515 can you discern at sea?</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN Nothing at all: it is a high-wrought flood 516 :</p>
<p>I cannot, ’twixt the heaven and the main 517 ,</p>
<p>Descry 518 a sail.</p>
<p>MONTANO Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land:</p>
<p>A fuller blast ne’er shook our battlements.</p>
<p>If it hath ruffianed 519 so upon the sea,</p>
<p>What ribs 520 of oak, when mountains melt on them,</p>
<p>Can hold the mortise 521 ? What shall we hear of this?</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN A segregation 522 of the Turkish fleet:</p>
<p>For do but stand upon the foaming shore,</p>
<p>The chidden 523 billow seems to pelt the clouds:</p>
<p>The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane 524 ,</p>
<p>Seems to cast water on the burning bear 525</p>
<p>And quench the guards 526 of th’ever-fixèd pole 527 .</p>
<p>I never did like molestation 528 view</p>
<p>On the enchafèd 529 flood.</p>
<p>MONTANO If that the Turkish fleet</p>
<p>Be not ensheltered and embayed 530 , they are drowned:</p>
<p>It is impossible to bear it out.</p>
<p>Enter a [Third ] Gentleman</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN News, lads! Our wars are done:</p>
<p>The desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks</p>
<p>That their designment 531 halts. A noble ship of Venice</p>
<p>Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance 532</p>
<p>On most part of their fleet.</p>
<p>MONTANO How? Is this true?</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN The ship is here put in,</p>
<p>A Veronesa 533 . Michael Cassio,</p>
<p>Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,</p>
<p>Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,</p>
<p>And is in full commission here 534 for Cyprus.</p>
<p>MONTANO I am glad on’t: ’tis a worthy governor.</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort</p>
<p>Touching 535 the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly 536</p>
<p>And pray 537 the Moor be safe; for they were parted</p>
<p>With foul and violent tempest.</p>
<p>MONTANO Pray heavens he be,</p>
<p>For I have served him, and the man commands</p>
<p>Like a full 538 soldier. Let’s to the seaside, ho!</p>
<p>As well to see the vessel that’s come in</p>
<p>As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,</p>
<p>Even till we make the main and th’aerial blue</p>
<p>An indistinct regard 539 .</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN Come, let’s do so;</p>
<p>For every minute is expectancy</p>
<p>Of more arrivancy 540 .</p>
<p>Enter Cassio</p>
<p>CASSIO Thanks, you the valiant of the warlike isle,</p>
<p>That so approve 541 the Moor. O, let the heavens</p>
<p>Give him defence against the elements,</p>
<p>For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.</p>
<p>MONTANO Is he well shipped?</p>
<p>CASSIO His bark 542 is stoutly timbered, and his pilot 543</p>
<p>Of very expert and approved allowance 544 ;</p>
<p>Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,</p>
<p>Stand in bold cure 545 .</p>
<p>[VOICES] A sail, a sail, a sail!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>CASSIO What noise?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN The town is empty: on the brow o’th’sea 546</p>
<p>Stand ranks of people, and they cry ‘A sail!’</p>
<p>CASSIO My hopes do shape him for 547 the governor.</p>
<p>A shot is heard</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN They do discharge their shot of courtesy 548 :</p>
<p>Our friends at least.</p>
<p>CASSIO I pray you, sir, go forth</p>
<p>And give us truth who’tis that is arrived.</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN I shall.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>MONTANO But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?</p>
<p>CASSIO Most fortunately: he hath achieved 549 a maid</p>
<p>That paragons 550 description and wild 551 fame 552 ,</p>
<p>One that excels the quirks 553 of blazoning pens,</p>
<p>And in th’essential vesture 554 of creation 555</p>
<p>Does tire the engineer 556 557 .</p>
<p>Enter Gentleman</p>
<p>How now? Who has put in 558 ?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN ’Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.</p>
<p>CASSIO He’s had most favourable and happy speed 559 :</p>
<p>Tempests themselves, high seas and howling winds,</p>
<p>The guttered 560 rocks and congregated sands 561 ,</p>
<p>Traitors ensteeped 562 to enclog 563 the guiltless keel,</p>
<p>As 564 having sense of beauty, do omit 565</p>
<p>Their mortal 566 natures, letting go safely by</p>
<p>The divine Desdemona.</p>
<p>MONTANO What is she?</p>
<p>CASSIO She that I spake of, our great captain’s captain,</p>
<p>Left in the conduct of 567 the bold Iago,</p>
<p>Whose footing 568 here anticipates our thoughts</p>
<p>A sennight’s 569 speed 570 . Great Jove 571 , Othello guard,</p>
<p>And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,</p>
<p>That he may bless this bay with his tall 572 ship,</p>
<p>Make love’s quick 573 pants in Desdemona’s arms,</p>
<p>Give renewed fire to our extincted 574 spirits—</p>
<p>Enter Desdemona, Iago, Rodorigo and Emilia [with Attendants ]</p>
<p>O, behold,</p>
<p>The riches of the ship is come on shore!</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>You men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.—</p>
<p>Hail to thee, lady! And the grace of heaven,</p>
<p>Before, behind thee, and on every hand</p>
<p>Enwheel 575 thee round!</p>
<p>Rises</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I thank you, valiant Cassio.</p>
<p>What tidings can you tell of my lord?</p>
<p>CASSIO He is not yet arrived, nor know I aught</p>
<p>But that he’s well and will be shortly here.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA O, but I fear. How lost you company?</p>
<p>CASSIO The great contention of sea and skies</p>
<p>Parted our fellowship 576 .— But, hark! A sail.</p>
<p>[VOICES] A sail, a sail!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>A shot is heard</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN They give this greeting to the citadel 577 :</p>
<p>This likewise is a friend.</p>
<p>CASSIO See for the news.</p>
<p>[Exit Gentleman ]</p>
<p>Good ancient, you are welcome.— Welcome, mistress.—</p>
<p>Let it not gall 578 your patience, good Iago,</p>
<p>That I extend my manners: ’tis my breeding 579</p>
<p>That gives me this bold show of courtesy.</p>
<p>Kisses Emilia</p>
<p>IAGO Sir, would she give you so much of her lips</p>
<p>As of her tongue 580 she oft bestows on me,</p>
<p>You would have enough.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Alas, she has no speech 581 .</p>
<p>IAGO In faith, too much:</p>
<p>I find it still 582 , when I have leave 583 to sleep.</p>
<p>Marry, before 584 your ladyship, I grant,</p>
<p>She puts her tongue a little in her heart</p>
<p>And chides 585 with thinking.</p>
<p>EMILIA You have little cause to say so.</p>
<p>IAGO Come on, come on: you are pictures 586 out of door, bells 587 in
your parlours 588 , wild-cats in your kitchens, saints in your injuries,
devils being offended, players 589 in your housewifery 590 , and
housewives 591 in your beds.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA O, fie upon thee, slanderer!</p>
<p>IAGO Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk 592 :</p>
<p>You rise to play 593 and go to bed to work 594 .</p>
<p>EMILIA You shall not write my praise.</p>
<p>IAGO No, let me not.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA What wouldst write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?</p>
<p>IAGO O gentle lady, do not put me to’t,</p>
<p>For I am nothing if not critical.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Come on assay 595 . There’s one gone to the harbour?</p>
<p>IAGO Ay, madam.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I am not merry, but I do beguile 596</p>
<p>The thing I am by seeming otherwise.</p>
<p>Come, how wouldst thou praise me?</p>
<p>IAGO I am about it, but indeed my invention 597</p>
<p>Comes from my pate 598 as birdlime 599 does from frieze 600 ,</p>
<p>It plucks out brains and all. But my muse 601 labours 602 ,</p>
<p>And thus she is delivered:</p>
<p>’If she be fair 603 and wise, fairness and wit 604 ,</p>
<p>The one’s for use 605 , the other useth it 606 . ’</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Well praised! How if she be black 607 and witty?</p>
<p>IAGO ’If she be black, and thereto 608 have a wit,</p>
<p>She’ll find a white 609 that shall her blackness 610 fit 611 . ’</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Worse and worse.</p>
<p>EMILIA How if fair and foolish?</p>
<p>IAGO ’She never yet was foolish that was fair,</p>
<p>For even her folly 612 helped her to an heir 613 . ’</p>
<p>DESDEMONA These are old fond 614 paradoxes to make fools laugh
i’th’ale-house. What miserable praise hast thou for her that’s foul 615
and foolish?</p>
<p>IAGO ’There’s none so foul and foolish thereunto 616 ,</p>
<p>But does foul pranks 617 which fair and wise ones do. ’</p>
<p>DESDEMONA O heavy 618 ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But
what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that,
in the authority of her merit, did justly put on the vouch of very
malice itself 619 ?</p>
<p>IAGO ’She that was ever fair and never proud,</p>
<p>Had tongue 620 at will 621 and yet was never loud,</p>
<p>Never lacked gold and yet went never gay 622 ,</p>
<p>Fled from her wish and yet said’ ‘Now I may 623’ ’,</p>
<p>She that being ang’red, her revenge being nigh,</p>
<p>Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,</p>
<p>She that in wisdom never was so frail</p>
<p>To change the cod’s head 624 for the salmon’s tail 625 626 ,</p>
<p>She that could think and ne’er disclose her mind,</p>
<p>See suitors following and not look behind,</p>
<p>She was a wight 627 , if ever such wights were— ’</p>
<p>DESDEMONA To do what?</p>
<p>IAGO ‘To suckle 628 fools and chronicle small beer 629 .’</p>
<p>DESDEMONA O, most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him,
Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you, Cassio? Is he not a most
profane and liberal 630 counsellor?</p>
<p>CASSIO He speaks home 631 , madam: you may relish him more in the 632
soldier than in the scholar.</p>
<p>Cassio takes Desdemona’s hand and they converse apart</p>
<p>IAGO He takes her by the palm: ay, well said, whisper. With as little
a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon
her, do: I will gyve 633 thee in thine own courtship 634 . You say true,
’tis so, indeed 635 : if such tricks 636 as these strip you out of your
lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers
637 so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir 638 in.
Very good: well kissed, and excellent courtesy 639 ! ’Tis so, indeed.
Yet again your fingers to your lips? Would they were clyster-pipes 640
for your sake!— The Moor! I know his trumpet.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Trumpet within</p>
<p>CASSIO ’Tis truly so.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Let’s meet him and receive him.</p>
<p>CASSIO Lo 641 , where he comes!</p>
<p>Enter Othello and Attendants</p>
<p>OTHELLO O my fair warrior!</p>
<p>DESDEMONA My dear Othello!</p>
<p>OTHELLO It gives me wonder great as my content</p>
<p>To see you here before me. O my soul’s joy!</p>
<p>If after every tempest come such calms,</p>
<p>May the winds blow till they have wakened death!</p>
<p>And let the labouring bark 642 climb hills of seas</p>
<p>Olympus-high 643 and duck again as low</p>
<p>As hell’s from heaven! If it were now to die 644 ,</p>
<p>’Twere now to be most happy, for I fear</p>
<p>My soul hath her content so absolute</p>
<p>That not another comfort like to this</p>
<p>Succeeds 645 in unknown fate.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA The heavens forbid</p>
<p>But that our loves and comforts should increase,</p>
<p>Even as our days do grow!</p>
<p>OTHELLO Amen to that, sweet powers!</p>
<p>I cannot speak enough of this content:</p>
<p>It stops 646 me here 647 : it is too much of joy.</p>
<p>And this, and this, the greatest discords be</p>
<p>Kisses her</p>
<p>That e’er our hearts shall make!</p>
<p>IAGO O, you are well tuned now!</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>But I’ll set down 648 the pegs that make this music,</p>
<p>As honest as I am.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Come, let us to the castle.—</p>
<p>To Desdemona</p>
<p>News, friends: our wars are done, the Turks are drowned.</p>
<p>How does my old acquaintance of this isle?—</p>
<p>Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus:</p>
<p>I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,</p>
<p>I prattle 649 out of fashion 650 , and I dote 651</p>
<p>In mine own comforts 652 . I prithee, good Iago,</p>
<p>Go to the bay and disembark my coffers 653 .</p>
<p>Bring thou the master 654 to the citadel:</p>
<p>He is a good one, and his worthiness</p>
<p>Does challenge 655 much respect.— Come, Desdemona,</p>
<p>Once more, well met at Cyprus.</p>
<p>Exeunt Othello and Desdemona [with Attendants. Iago and Rodorigo
remain ]</p>
<p>IAGO Do thou meet me presently at the harbour.—</p>
<p>To an Attendant as he exits</p>
<p>Come hither. If thou be’st valiant—as they say base 656 men being in
love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them —
list 657 me: the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard 658 .
First, I must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly 659 in love with
him.</p>
<p>To Rodorigo</p>
<p>RODORIGO With him? Why, ’tis not possible.</p>
<p>IAGO Lay thy finger thus 660 , and let thy soul be instructed. Mark
me 661 with what violence she first loved the Moor, but 662 for bragging
and telling her fantastical lies. To love him still for prating 663 ?
Let not thy discreet 664 heart think it. Her eye must be fed: and what
delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull
665 with the act of sport 666 , there should be a game 667 to inflame it
and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour 668 ,
sympathy 669 in years, manners and beauties, all which the Moor is
defective in. Now, for want of these required conveniences 670 , her
delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge
671 , disrelish 672 and abhor the Moor: very nature will instruct her in
it and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted — as it
is a most pregnant 673 and unforced position 674 —who stands so eminent
675 in the degree 676 677 of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very
voluble 678 , no further conscionable 679 than in putting on the mere
form of civil and humane 680 seeming 681 for the better compass 682 of
his salt 683 and most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none. A
slipper 684 and subtle 685 knave, a finder of occasion 686 , that has an
eye can stamp 687 and counterfeit advantages 688 , though true 689
advantage never present itself: a devilish knave. Besides, the knave is
handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly 690 and
green 691 minds look after 692 . A pestilent 693 complete 694 knave, and
the woman hath found him already.</p>
<p>RODORIGO I cannot believe that in her: she’s full of most blessed
condition 695 .</p>
<p>IAGO Blessed fig’s-end 696 ! 697 The wine she drinks is made of
grapes 698 . If she had been blessed, she would never have loved the
Moor. Blessed pudding 699 ! Didst thou not see her paddle 700 with the
palm of his hand? Didst not mark that?</p>
<p>RODORIGO Yes, that I did, but that was but courtesy.</p>
<p>IAGO Lechery, by this hand: an index 701 and obscure 702 prologue to
the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips
that their breaths embraced together. Villainous thoughts, Rodorigo!
When these mutabilities 703 so marshal the way, hard 704 at hand comes
the master and main 705 exercise 706 , th’incorporate 707 conclusion.
Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I have brought you from Venice.
Watch you 708 tonight: for the command, I’ll lay’t upon you 709 . Cassio
knows you not. I’ll not be far from you. Do you find some occasion to
anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline
710 , or from what other course you please, which the time shall more
favourably minister 711 .</p>
<p>RODORIGO Well.</p>
<p>IAGO Sir, he’s rash and very sudden in choler 712 , and haply 713 may
strike at you: provoke him that he may, for even out of that will I
cause these 714 of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into
no true taste again 715 but by the displanting 716 of Cassio. So shall
you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then
have to prefer 717 them, and the impediment most profitably removed,
without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity 718 .</p>
<p>RODORIGO I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity 719
.</p>
<p>IAGO I warrant 720 thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel: I must
fetch his 721 necessaries ashore. Farewell.</p>
<p>RODORIGO Adieu.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>IAGO That Cassio loves her, I do well believe’t:</p>
<p>That she loves him, ’tis apt 722 and of great credit 723 .</p>
<p>The Moor — howbeit that I endure him not 724 —</p>
<p>Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,</p>
<p>And I dare think he’ll prove to Desdemona</p>
<p>A most dear 725 husband. Now, I do love her too,</p>
<p>Not out of absolute lust — though peradventure 726</p>
<p>I stand accountant 727 for as great a sin —</p>
<p>But partly led to diet 728 my revenge,</p>
<p>For that 729 I do suspect the lusty Moor</p>
<p>Hath leaped into 730 my seat 731 , the thought whereof</p>
<p>Doth — like a poisonous mineral — gnaw my inwards:</p>
<p>And nothing can or shall content my soul</p>
<p>Till I am evened with him, wife for wife,</p>
<p>Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor</p>
<p>At least into a jealousy so strong</p>
<p>That judgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,</p>
<p>If this poor trash of Venice 732 , whom I trace 733</p>
<p>For 734 his quick hunting, stand the putting on 735 ,</p>
<p>I’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip 736 ,</p>
<p>Abuse him to the Moor in the right garb 737 —</p>
<p>For I fear Cassio with my night-cap 738 too —</p>
<p>Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me</p>
<p>For making him egregiously 739 an ass</p>
<p>And practising upon 740 his peace and quiet</p>
<p>Even to madness. ’Tis here 741 , but yet confused:</p>
<p>Knavery’s plain face is never seen till used.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
