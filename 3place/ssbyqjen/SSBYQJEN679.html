13</h4>
<p>Enter, as to the Parliament, Bullingbrook, Aumerle, Northumberland,
Percy, Fitzwaters, Surrey, Carlisle, Abbot of Westminister, Herald,
Officers and Bagot</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Call forth Bagot.——</p>
<p>Bagot is brought forward</p>
<p>Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind,</p>
<p>What thou dost know of noble Gloucester’s death,</p>
<p>Who wrought 954 it with the king, and who performed</p>
<p>The bloody office 955 of his timeless 956 end.</p>
<p>BAGOT Then set before my face the lord Aumerle.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.</p>
<p>To Aumerle</p>
<p>BAGOT My lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue</p>
<p>Scorns to unsay 957 what it hath once delivered.</p>
<p>In that dead 958 time when Gloucester’s death was plotted,</p>
<p>I heard you say, ’Is not my arm of length 959 ,</p>
<p>That reacheth from the restful English court</p>
<p>As far as Calais, to my uncle’s head?’</p>
<p>Amongst much other talk, that very time,</p>
<p>I heard you say that you had rather refuse</p>
<p>The offer of an hundred thousand crowns 960</p>
<p>Than 961 Bullingbrook’s return to England;</p>
<p>Adding withal 962 how blest this land would be</p>
<p>In this your cousin’s death.</p>
<p>AUMERLE Princes and noble lords,</p>
<p>What answer shall I make to this base 963 man?</p>
<p>Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars 964 ,</p>
<p>On equal terms to give him chastisement? 965</p>
<p>Either I must, or have mine honour soiled</p>
<p>With th’attainder 966 of his sland’rous lips.——</p>
<p>Throws down his gage</p>
<p>There is my gage, the manual seal of death 967</p>
<p>That marks thee out for hell. I say thou liest,</p>
<p>And will maintain what thou hast said is false</p>
<p>In thy heart-blood, though being all too base</p>
<p>To stain the temper 968 of my knightly sword.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Bagot, forbear 969 . Thou shalt not take it up.</p>
<p>AUMERLE Excepting one 970 , I would he were the best</p>
<p>In all this presence that hath moved 971 me so.</p>
<p>FITZWATERS If that thy valour stand 972 on sympathy 973 ,</p>
<p>To Aumerle</p>
<p>There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage 974 to thine.</p>
<p>Throws down his gage</p>
<p>By that fair sun that shows me where thou stand’st,</p>
<p>I heard thee say, and vauntingly 975 thou spak’st it,</p>
<p>That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester’s death.</p>
<p>If thou deniest 976 it twenty times, thou liest,</p>
<p>And I will turn 977 thy falsehood to thy heart,</p>
<p>Where it was forgèd, with my rapier’s point.</p>
<p>AUMERLE Thou dar’st not, coward, live to see the day.</p>
<p>FITZWATERS Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.</p>
<p>AUMERLE Fitzwaters, thou art damned to hell for this.</p>
<p>PERCY Aumerle, thou liest: his honour is as true</p>
<p>In this appeal 978 as thou art all unjust.</p>
<p>And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,</p>
<p>To prove it on thee to th’extremest point</p>
<p>Throws down his gage</p>
<p>Of mortal breathing 979 . Seize it, if thou dar’st.</p>
<p>AUMERLE An 980 if I do not, may my hands rot off</p>
<p>Picks up the gage</p>
<p>And never brandish more 981 revengeful steel</p>
<p>Over the glittering helmet of my foe!</p>
<p>SURREY My lord Fitzwaters, I do remember well</p>
<p>The very time Aumerle and you did talk.</p>
<p>FITZWATERS My lord, ’tis very true. You were in presence 982 then</p>
<p>And you can witness with me this is true.</p>
<p>SURREY As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.</p>
<p>FITZWATERS Surrey, thou liest.</p>
<p>SURREY Dishonourable boy!</p>
<p>That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword</p>
<p>That it shall render 983 vengeance and revenge</p>
<p>Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie</p>
<p>In earth as quiet as thy father’s skull,</p>
<p>In proof whereof, there is mine honour’s pawn.</p>
<p>Throws down his gage</p>
<p>Engage it to the trial 984 , if thou dar’st.</p>
<p>FITZWATERS How fondly 985 dost thou spur a forward 986 horse!</p>
<p>If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,</p>
<p>I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness 987 ,</p>
<p>And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,</p>
<p>And lies, and lies. There is my bond of faith,</p>
<p>Throws down his gage</p>
<p>To tie 988 thee to my strong correction 989 .</p>
<p>As I intend to thrive in this new world,</p>
<p>Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal.</p>
<p>Besides, I heard the banished Norfolk say</p>
<p>That 990 thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men</p>
<p>To execute the noble duke at Calais.</p>
<p>AUMERLE Some honest Christian trust me with a gage.</p>
<p>Borrows a gage, then throws it down</p>
<p>That Norfolk lies, here do I throw down this,</p>
<p>If he may be repealed 991 , to try 992 his honour.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK These differences 993 shall all rest under gage 994</p>
<p>Till Norfolk be repealed. Repealed he shall be,</p>
<p>And, though mine enemy, restored again</p>
<p>To all his lands and signories 995 . When he’s returned,</p>
<p>Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial 996 .</p>
<p>CARLISLE That honourable day shall ne’er be seen.</p>
<p>Many a time hath banished Norfolk fought</p>
<p>For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field 997 ,</p>
<p>Streaming the ensign 998 of the Christian cross</p>
<p>Against black pagans, Turks and Saracens,</p>
<p>And toiled 999 with works of war, retired himself</p>
<p>To Italy, and there at Venice gave</p>
<p>His body to that pleasant country’s earth,</p>
<p>And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,</p>
<p>Under whose colours 1000 he had fought so long.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?</p>
<p>CARLISLE As sure as I live, my lord.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom</p>
<p>Of good old Abraham 1001 ! Lords appellants 1002 ,</p>
<p>Your differences shall all rest under gage</p>
<p>Till we assign you to your days of trial.</p>
<p>Enter York</p>
<p>YORK Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee</p>
<p>From plume-plucked 1003 Richard, who with willing soul</p>
<p>Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields</p>
<p>To the possession of thy royal hand.</p>
<p>Ascend his throne, descending 1004 now from him,</p>
<p>And long live Henry, of that name the fourth!</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK In God’s name, I’ll ascend the regal throne.</p>
<p>CARLISLE Marry 1005 , heaven forbid!</p>
<p>Worst 1006 in this royal presence may I speak,</p>
<p>Yet best beseeming 1007 me to speak the truth.</p>
<p>Would God that any in this noble presence</p>
<p>Were enough noble to be upright judge</p>
<p>Of noble Richard! Then true noblesse 1008 would</p>
<p>Learn 1009 him forbearance from so foul a wrong.</p>
<p>What subject can give sentence on his king?</p>
<p>And who sits here that is not Richard’s subject?</p>
<p>Thieves are not judged but they are by 1010 to hear,</p>
<p>Although apparent 1011 guilt be seen in them.</p>
<p>And shall the figure 1012 of God’s majesty,</p>
<p>His captain, steward, deputy-elect,</p>
<p>Anointed, crownèd, planted many years,</p>
<p>Be judged by subject 1013 and inferior breath,</p>
<p>And he himself not present? O, forbid it, God,</p>
<p>That in a Christian climate souls refined</p>
<p>Should show so heinous 1014 , black, obscene 1015 a deed.</p>
<p>I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,</p>
<p>Stirred up by heaven, thus boldly for his king.</p>
<p>My lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,</p>
<p>Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford’s king.</p>
<p>And if you crown him, let me prophesy</p>
<p>The blood of English shall manure 1016 the ground,</p>
<p>And future ages groan for his foul act.</p>
<p>Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,</p>
<p>And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars</p>
<p>Shall kin with kin and kind 1017 with kind confound 1018 .</p>
<p>Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny</p>
<p>Shall here inhabit, and this land be called</p>
<p>The field 1019 of Golgotha 1020 and dead men’s skulls.</p>
<p>O, if you rear this house 1021 against this house,</p>
<p>It will the woefullest division prove</p>
<p>That ever fell upon this cursèd earth.</p>
<p>Prevent it, resist it, and let it not be so,</p>
<p>Lest child, child’s children, cry against you ‘Woe!’</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Well have you argued, sir. And for your pains,</p>
<p>Of capital treason we arrest you here.</p>
<p>My lord of Westminster, be it your charge</p>
<p>To keep him safely till his day of trial.</p>
<p>May it please you, lords, to grant the commons’ suit 1022 ?</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Fetch hither Richard, that in common view</p>
<p>He may surrender 1023 , so we shall proceed</p>
<p>Without suspicion.</p>
<p>YORK I will be his conduct 1024 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Lords, you that here are under our arrest,</p>
<p>Procure your sureties 1025 for your days of answer 1026 .</p>
<p>Little are we beholding 1027 to your love,</p>
<p>And little looked for 1028 at your helping hands.</p>
<p>Enter Richard and York [with Officers bearing the regalia 1029 ]</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Alack, why am I sent for to a king,</p>
<p>Before I have shook off the regal thoughts</p>
<p>Wherewith I reigned? I hardly yet have learned</p>
<p>To insinuate 1030 , flatter, bow, and bend my knee.</p>
<p>Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me</p>
<p>To this submission. Yet I well remember</p>
<p>The favours 1031 of these men: were they not mine?</p>
<p>Did they not sometime 1032 cry, ‘All hail!’ to me?</p>
<p>So Judas did to Christ, but he in twelve 1033</p>
<p>Found truth in all but one; I, in twelve thousand, none.</p>
<p>God save the king! Will no man say ‘Amen’?</p>
<p>Am I both priest and clerk 1034 ? Well then, amen.</p>
<p>God save the king, although I be not he.</p>
<p>And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.</p>
<p>To do what service 1035 am I sent for hither?</p>
<p>YORK To do that office of thine own good will</p>
<p>Which tired majesty 1036 did make thee offer:</p>
<p>The resignation of thy state and crown</p>
<p>To Henry Bullingbrook.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Give me the crown.—— Here, cousin, seize 1037 the
crown:</p>
<p>Takes the crown and offers it to Bullingbrook</p>
<p>Here cousin, on this side my hand, on that side thine.</p>
<p>Now is this golden crown like a deep well</p>
<p>That owes 1038 two buckets, filling one another 1039 ,</p>
<p>The emptier ever dancing in the air,</p>
<p>The other down 1040 , unseen and full of water:</p>
<p>That bucket down and full of tears am I,</p>
<p>Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK I thought you had been willing to resign.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD My crown I am, but still my griefs are mine.</p>
<p>You may my glories and my state depose,</p>
<p>But not my griefs; still am I king of those.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Part of your cares you give me with your crown.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.</p>
<p>My care is loss of care, by old care done 1041 :</p>
<p>Your care is gain of care, by new care won.</p>
<p>The cares I give I have, though given away,</p>
<p>They tend 1042 the crown, yet still with me they stay.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Are you contented to resign the crown?</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Ay 1043 , no 1044 ; no, ay, for I must nothing be:</p>
<p>Therefore no ‘no’, for I resign to thee.</p>
<p>Now mark me 1045 how I will undo 1046 myself:</p>
<p>I give this heavy weight from off my head,</p>
<p>Bullingbrook accepts crown</p>
<p>And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,</p>
<p>Bullingbrook accepts sceptre</p>
<p>The pride of kingly sway 1047 from out my heart.</p>
<p>With mine own tears I wash away my balm,</p>
<p>With mine own hands I give away my crown,</p>
<p>With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,</p>
<p>With mine own breath release all duteous oaths 1048 .</p>
<p>All pomp and majesty I do forswear 1049 :</p>
<p>My manors, rents, revenues I forgo:</p>
<p>My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny.</p>
<p>God pardon all oaths that are broke to me,</p>
<p>God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee.</p>
<p>Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved 1050 ,</p>
<p>And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved.</p>
<p>Long mayst thou live in Richard’s seat to sit,</p>
<p>And soon lie Richard in an earthy pit!</p>
<p>‘God save King Henry’, unkinged Richard says,</p>
<p>‘And send him many years of sunshine days!’ ——</p>
<p>What more remains?</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND No more, but that you read</p>
<p>Gives a paper</p>
<p>These accusations and these grievous crimes</p>
<p>Committed by your person and your followers</p>
<p>Against the state and profit of this land,</p>
<p>That, by confessing them, the souls of men</p>
<p>May deem that you are worthily deposed.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Must I do so? And must I ravel out 1051</p>
<p>My weaved-up follies? Gentle 1052 Northumberland,</p>
<p>If thy offences were upon record,</p>
<p>Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop 1053</p>
<p>To read a lecture 1054 of them? If thou wouldst,</p>
<p>There shouldst thou find one heinous article 1055 ,</p>
<p>Containing the deposing of a king</p>
<p>And cracking the strong warrant 1056 of an oath,</p>
<p>Marked with a blot, damned in the book of heaven.</p>
<p>Nay, all of you that stand and look upon me,</p>
<p>Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait 1057 myself,</p>
<p>Though some of you with Pilate 1058 wash your hands</p>
<p>Showing an outward pity, yet you Pilates</p>
<p>Have here delivered me to my sour 1059 cross,</p>
<p>And water cannot wash away your sin.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND My lord, dispatch 1060 . Read o’er these articles.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see.</p>
<p>And yet salt water blinds them not so much</p>
<p>But they can see a sort 1061 of traitors here.</p>
<p>Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,</p>
<p>I find myself a traitor with the rest,</p>
<p>For I have given here my soul’s consent</p>
<p>T’undeck 1062 the pompous 1063 body of a king;</p>
<p>Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,</p>
<p>Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND My lord——</p>
<p>KING RICHARD No lord of thine, thou haught 1064 insulting man,</p>
<p>No, nor no man’s lord.—— I have no name, no title;</p>
<p>No, not that name was given me at the font 1065 ,</p>
<p>But ’tis usurped. Alack the heavy day,</p>
<p>That I have worn so many winters out,</p>
<p>And know not now what name to call myself.</p>
<p>O, that I were a mockery 1066 king of snow,</p>
<p>Standing before the sun of Bullingbrook,</p>
<p>To melt myself away in water-drops!</p>
<p>Good king, great king —— and yet not greatly good ——</p>
<p>An if 1067 my word be sterling 1068 yet in England,</p>
<p>Let it command a mirror hither straight,</p>
<p>That it may show me what 1069 a face I have,</p>
<p>Since it is bankrupt of his 1070 majesty.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Go some 1071 of you and fetch a looking-glass 1072 .</p>
<p>[Exit an Attendant ]</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Read o’er this paper while the glass doth come.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Fiend, thou torments me ere I come to hell!</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Urge it no more, my lord Northumberland.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND The commons will not then be satisfied.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD They shall be satisfied. I’ll read enough,</p>
<p>When I do see the very book indeed</p>
<p>Where all my sins are writ, and that’s myself.</p>
<p>Enter one, with a glass</p>
<p>Give me that glass, and therein will I read.</p>
<p>Takes the mirror</p>
<p>No deeper wrinkles yet? Hath sorrow struck</p>
<p>So many blows upon this face of mine,</p>
<p>And made no deeper wounds? O flatt’ring glass,</p>
<p>Like to my followers in prosperity,</p>
<p>Thou dost beguile 1073 me! Was this face the face</p>
<p>That every day under his household roof</p>
<p>Did keep 1074 ten thousand men? Was this the face</p>
<p>That like the sun did make beholders wink 1075 ?</p>
<p>Is this the face which faced 1076 so many follies,</p>
<p>That was at last out-faced 1077 by Bullingbrook?</p>
<p>A brittle glory shineth in this face,</p>
<p>As brittle as the glory is the face.</p>
<p>Throws the mirror down against the ground</p>
<p>For there it is, cracked in an hundred shivers 1078 .</p>
<p>Mark, silent king, the moral 1079 of this sport,</p>
<p>How soon my sorrow hath destroyed my face.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK The shadow 1080 of your sorrow hath destroyed</p>
<p>The shadow of your face.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Say that again.</p>
<p>The shadow of my sorrow? Ha? Let’s see,</p>
<p>’Tis very true, my grief lies all within,</p>
<p>And these external manner 1081 of laments</p>
<p>Are merely shadows to the unseen grief</p>
<p>That swells with silence in the tortured soul.</p>
<p>There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,</p>
<p>For thy great bounty, that not only giv’st</p>
<p>Me cause to wail, but teachest me the way</p>
<p>How to lament the cause. I’ll beg one boon 1082 ,</p>
<p>And then be gone and trouble you no more.</p>
<p>Shall I obtain it?</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Name it, fair cousin.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD ‘Fair cousin’? I am greater than a king,</p>
<p>For when I was a king, my flatterers</p>
<p>Were then but subjects; being now a subject,</p>
<p>I have a king here to 1083 my flatterer.</p>
<p>Being so great, I have no need to beg.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Yet ask.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD And shall I have?</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK You shall.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Then give me leave to go.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Whither?</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Whither you will, so I were from your sights.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Go, some of you convey 1084 him to the Tower.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD O, good! ‘Convey’? Conveyers are you all,</p>
<p>That rise thus nimbly by a true king’s fall.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Richard, some Lords and a Guard ]</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK On Wednesday next we solemnly set down 1085</p>
<p>Our coronation. Lords, prepare yourselves.</p>
<p>Exeunt [all except Carlisle, the Abbot and Aumerle ]</p>
<p>ABBOT A woeful pageant have we here beheld.</p>
<p>CARLISLE The woe’s to come. The children yet unborn</p>
<p>Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.</p>
<p>AUMERLE You holy clergymen, is there no plot</p>
<p>To rid the realm of this pernicious 1086 blot?</p>
<p>ABBOT Before I freely speak my mind herein,</p>
<p>You shall not only take the sacrament 1087</p>
<p>To bury 1088 mine intents, but also to effect</p>
<p>Whatever I shall happen to devise.</p>
<p>I see your brows are full of discontent,</p>
<p>Your heart of sorrow and your eyes of tears.</p>
<p>Come home with me to supper. I’ll lay</p>
<p>A plot shall show us all a merry day.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 5</p>
