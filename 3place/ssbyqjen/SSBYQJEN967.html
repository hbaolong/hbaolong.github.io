<h4 id="introduction-to">Introduction to</h4>
<p>Poems and Sonnets</p>
<p>Shakespeare became famous as a poet before most people knew that he
also wrote plays. To judge by the frequency of admiring allusions and
demand for printed copies, Venus and Adonis was the most popular long
poem of the Elizabethan age. Like Shakespeare’s subsequent narrative
poem, The Rape of Lucrece , it was written during the period in 1593–94
when the theatres were closed due to plague, and based on the works of
the Roman poet Ovid. These works are calling cards which announce
Shakespeare’s poetic sophistication, perhaps in response to the jibe in
Greene’s Groatsworth of Wit (1592) about ‘Shake-scene’, the ‘upstart
crow’, the vulgar jack-of-all-trades from the country.</p>
<p>Great swathes of Venus and Adonis are composed in the form of
dialogue, while the eye contact between male and female subjects is
self-consciously theatricalized. In both their speech patterns and their
accompanying actions, Venus and Adonis are turned into dramatic
characters, their story into a theatrical encounter, albeit one that
relies on a naturalistic rural setting peopled with animals and natural
forces that could not have been represented on stage. The Elizabethan
reader’s pleasure in the poem lay in its cunning rhetoric, the inventive
conceit of its language. The resourceful Venus has many an example, as
when she compares herself to a park and Adonis to a deer. The double
entendre whereby landscape and body parts become as one is typical of
the poem: Shakespeare is trying out that language of indefatigable
innuendo that will characterize so many of his subsequent plays. He is
also experimenting with the idea that sexual attraction is sparked by
contrariness and apparent disdain. The dynamic between a pair of
erotically-charged horses anticipates not only the relationship of Venus
and Adonis, but also those of the speaker of the sonnets and his
beloved, not to mention Berowne and Rosaline in Love’s Labour’s Lost and
Beatrice and Benedick in Much Ado about Nothing .</p>
<p>For most of Venus and Adonis , sexual desire is a source of comedy,
whereas in The Rape of Lucrece the story of sexual pursuit is replayed
in a darker key. Having made a comic spectacle of the rapacious goddess,
Shakespeare makes a tragic spectacle of the raped emblem of chastity.
The two poems are opposite sides of the same coin, as may be seen from
their structural resemblance: in each, an ardent suitor attempts to gain
the reluctant object of her/his sexual desire by means of rhetorical
persuasion, fails, and indirectly or directly precipitates the death of
the object of desire. Both poems are centrally interested in the way in
which linguistic art is instrumental in the pursuit of sexual
satisfaction. Nothing provokes desire more than antithesis. The more
artless Lucrece is, the more Tarquin wishes to exercise the arts of love
upon her.</p>
<p>The Rape of Lucrece is not only Shakespeare’s most sustained
imitation of a classical source, it is also a supreme example of the art
of ‘copiousness’ that was recommended by sixteenth-century humanist
literary theorists: Shakespeare expanded the seventy-three lines of the
Lucrece story in Ovid’s Fasti into nearly two thousand. As with Venus
and Adonis , the most significant elaborations are those that invest the
characters with linguistic arts. Three extended discourses are
introduced: Tarquin’s inward disquisition as to whether he should carry
through his desire, the disputation between the two characters in the
bedroom, and Lucrece’s formal ‘complaint’ after the rape. At the end of
the poem, the final consequence of the rape is played through as the
Tarquins are heaved off their throne and the Roman republic is
established. It is because loss of empire is the ultimate cost which
Tarquin pays for his conquest – the military metaphors are all-pervasive
– that his victory is a defeat. The oxymoronic structure of the
narrative is thus brought to a climax: Tarquin’s gain is his family’s
loss, Lucrece’s loss is Rome’s gain. She is the sacrificial victim
required for the bringing of a new political order.</p>
<p>Shakespeare was much possessed by death, even when – as in Venus and
Adonis and the comedies – he wrote in the genres of life and love. Venus
expostulates against Death because he is the destroyer of beauty. She
proposes to Adonis that the beautiful have a duty to reproduce
themselves, not to hoard their loveliness in the manner of a miser (or,
in the bawdy sub-text, a masturbator). The first seventeen of
Shakespeare’s sonnets are a set of variations on the same theme.
Throughout the entire collection of 154 sonnets, there is a frequent
return to questions first explored in Venus and Adonis : not only
mortality and endurance, beauty and its transience, but also the
paradoxes of self and other, truth and delusion, in the dynamics of
desire. Adonis’ eyes are ‘Two glasses’ (i.e. mirrors) where Venus
‘herself herself beheld / A thousand times.’ At the climax of the sonnet
sequence, a key pun plays on the same idea: ‘For I have sworn thee fair:
more perjured eye, / To swear against the truth so foul a lie.’ The
relationship between ‘I’ and ‘eye’, inner self and the object of the
gaze, is an obsession in the sonnets, while ‘perjured’ is an example of
another hallmark of the collection, the application of legal language to
the promises made and broken by lovers. So, for instance, in Sonnet 30
(‘When to the sessions of sweet silent thought’), term after term has
legal connotations (‘sessions’, ‘summon’, ‘dateless’, ‘cancelled’,
‘expense’, ‘grievances’, ‘account’, ‘restored’).</p>
<p>It is probable that Shakespeare began composing sonnets soon after
writing Venus and Adonis –several are woven into Romeo and Juliet and
Love’s Labour’s Lost , plays that he wrote soon after the theatres
reopened in 1594, and others circulated in manuscript by 1598. But the
collection entitled Shakespeare’s Sonnets was not published until 1609.
We know neither whether it was authorized nor whether its arrangement of
the sequence was purposeful, though some clearly belong together, in
that successive sonnets sometimes allude to each other or enact
variations on a similar theme.</p>
<p>As one would expect from the hand of a dramatist, there does seem to
be a plot-line running through the sequence and a ‘character’ to each of
the personae. The first 126 poems appear to be written to a man (or a
succession of men?). The narrative extends over a considerable period of
time and runs the full gamut of emotions. The person addressed is
younger than Shakespeare and of higher rank. He is lovely and the image
of his mother. The first seventeen poems are exhortations to breed, in
the manner of Venus’ address to Adonis: ‘From fairest creatures we
desire increase, / That thereby beauty’s rose might never die.’ There is
then a modulation towards the idea that the poet’s own work of praise
may enable the young man to escape the ravages of time and death. Some
sort of relationship is then imagined, with the youth in a position of
power and the poet in one of supplication. Absence, travel, ‘disgrace’,
melancholy, estrangement and reunion are variously implied. The young
man appears to have an affair with the poet’s mistress, thus abusing the
bond of friendship. But he is eventually forgiven: ‘Take all my loves,
my love, yea, take them all: / What hast thou then more than thou hadst
before?’ Later, the poet is discomposed by a rival who claims to have
been taught by spirits to write ‘above a mortal pitch’ and who, with
‘the proud full sail of his great verse’, wins the patronage of the fair
youth. The sequence ends with its key motif of the battle between love
and time. The final poem to the youth is two lines short of the sonnet
form’s customary fourteen. It ends with a pair of empty brackets,
signalling some kind of closure or lacuna.</p>
<p>Sonnets 127–52, by contrast, explore the poet’s relationship with a
mistress, a dark-complexioned and sexually voracious woman who has
‘raven black’ brows. Sometimes her dark beauty is wittily defended
against the blonde Elizabethan ideal, but more frequently these poems
are filled with self-abnegation, misogyny, a lingering sense of the sour
taste that comes after sex, and disgust at the way in which the body
rules the spirit. The woman is accused of infidelity, including an
apparent affair with the ‘man right fair’ who is the poet’s ‘better
angel’ – this seems to allude back to the purported relationship between
‘friend’ and ‘mistress’ in the earlier sequence. Some of the ‘dark lady’
poems are seeringly honest about the deceptions that may occur between
lovers (‘O, love’s best habit is in seeming trust … Therefore I lie with
her and she with me, / And in our faults by lies we flattered be’),
while others are dazzlingly playful (notably 135–6, with their multiple
punning on senses of the word ‘Will’, including a persistent play on
Shakespeare’s own name). The final two sonnets are imitations of a Greek
epigram about the fire of love being quenched in a cool well, with clear
allusion to the Elizabethan custom of taking mercury baths as a cure for
syphilis. The implicit suggestion is that the poet has been venereally
infected by the ‘dark lady’.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s sonnets are a source of endless biographical
fascination because they seem to be the one work in which he speaks in
his own voice. ‘Scorn not the sonnet’, William Wordsworth wrote two
centuries later: ‘With this key, Shakespeare unlocked his heart.’ So it
is that the sonnets are often believed to bear a wholly different
relationship to Shakespeare’s biography from that of the rest of his
literary work. There is, however, no intrinsic reason why a sonnet – a
highly artificial literary form – should not be a dramatic performance
just as a play is. It may perfectly well be argued that for an
Elizabethan poet to dash off a sequence of sonnets was a kind of
exercise, a proof of artistic skill akin to the work of a composer
writing a set of variations on a musical theme. If Shakespeare could
imagine Hamlet and Romeo and Viola, he could also have invented the
‘plot’ and ‘characters’ of his sonnets. Robert Browning responded to
Wordsworth’s claim: ‘If so, the less Shakespeare he!’ Maybe the sonnets
are best read as assays of Shakespeare’s art, demonstrations of his
seemingly effortless verbal facility.</p>
<p>Unlike several contemporary sonneteers, Shakespeare does not name
names. Because he is so guarded, the circumstances of composition have
provoked centuries of speculation. The young man to whom the bulk of the
poems are addressed may or may not be synonymous with the mysterious ‘Mr
W. H.’ named in the collection’s dedication. The traditional candidates
for the role of addressee are the Earl of Pembroke and the Earl of
Southampton, though neither of them was a ‘Mr’. A very strong case has
been made for the possibility that ‘Mr W. H.’ is actually a misprint for
‘Mr W. S.’ and that in the dedication Thomas Thorpe, the publisher, is
merely acknowledging Shakespeare as the ‘only begetter’ of the sonnets
(‘begetting’ was a common metaphor for authoring).</p>
<p>Dozens of male Elizabethan poets wrote sonnet sequences, but only
Shakespeare and Richard Barnfield addressed their poems explicitly to a
man. Barnfield wrote in the explicitly homoerotic tradition of ancient
Greek pastoral poetry, whereas Shakespeare’s sequence emphasizes the
spiritual aspects of the poet’s love for the fair youth. The only
sonnets in the collection where ‘Will’ is actually in bed with a lover
are addressed to the dark lady. The young man’s ‘thing’ (which has been
‘pricked out’ by nature) is, says the poet in Sonnet 20, ‘to my purpose
nothing’ – though this is supremely ambiguous, since it could mean
either that he is not interested in a physical relationship or that the
prick serves him in the same way as a woman’s ‘nothing’ (vagina). Taken
in their entirety, the sonnets associate heterosexual desire with
consummation and disgust, homoerotic attraction with spirituality and an
intensity that derives in large measure from the impossibility of
consummation. Tempting as it may be to infer Shakespeare’s sexuality
from this duality, it might be better to read the opposition between
dark lady and fair youth as a dramatic device: one is a ‘character’
representing desire in its sexual manifestation, the other in its
idealizing and spiritual.</p>
<p>Several short poems of the period have been attributed to
Shakespeare, but in only two cases is the attribution absolutely secure.
One is a beautifully turned epilogue that meditates on time in an
address to Queen Elizabeth at the end of a court performance in February
1599. It remained unknown in manuscript until the late twentieth
century. The other is the mysterious poem that has become generally
known as ‘The Phoenix and Turtle’ (though Shakespeare did not give it a
title).</p>
<p>In 1601, a minor author called Robert Chester published a long
allegorical poem entitled Love’s Martyr , in which the mythical phoenix,
representing Queen Elizabeth, accepts the devoted service of a
turtle-dove, symbolizing a loyal courtier. The poem was dedicated to
John Salusbury of Llewenni, Denbighshire, and seems to have been printed
in honour of his being knighted by the queen in June 1601. Salusbury is
therefore a prime candidate for the role of the turtle-dove. When the
poem was published, it was accompanied by ‘Diverse Poetical Essays on
the Former Subject; viz. The Turtle and Phoenix’, also dedicated to
Salusbury and dated 1601. One of these poetical essays, beginning ‘Let
the bird of loudest lay’, was signed ‘William Shakespeare’ and is
unmistakably in his style. The poem seems to be a response to the
closing sequence of Chester’s: it imagines a group of birds at the
funeral of the phoenix and turtle. Again, the phoenix seems to be
Elizabeth, the turtle a loyal subject: ‘Distance and no space was seen /
’Twixt this turtle and his queen.’ But ‘Distance and no space’ is more
than a metaphor for the combination of propriety and loyalty required by
good courtiership. It is also a metaphysical conundrum. On being invited
(and presumably paid) to contribute to Chester’s volume, Shakespeare
took the opportunity to rework the union of phoenix and turtle as a
philosophical tour de force instead of a piece of routine poetic
flattery. A line such as ‘Either was the other’s mine’ may allude back
to a lengthy and tedious section of Chester’s poem concerning different
kinds of mining, but it works primarily as a brilliant pun on the
exchange of selfhood that is the core of true love. Whereas Chester’s
ambition was to gain or retain Salusbury’s patronage, Shakespeare rose
above the occasion and indulged a vein of serious intellectual play of a
kind much closer to the dazzling mind-bending of John Donne. ‘Single
natures, double name, / Neither two nor one was called’: these paradoxes
could serve not only as an epitaph for the phoenix and the turtle, but
also as an epigraph for the double vision – the ‘I am not that I am’,
the seeing ‘with parted eye, / When everything seems double’ – that
shapes Shakespeare’s dramatic universe.</p>
<h4 id="key-facts">KEY FACTS</h4>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: Venus and Adonis is in a six-line stanza rhyming
ababcc , Lucrece in a seven-line stanza rhyming ababbcc (known as ‘rhyme
royal’), both staple metres for poetic romance. Shakespeare’s sonnets,
like most other English examples of the period, are shaped as three
quatrains and a couplet (typically rhyming ababcdcdefefgg ), in contrast
to the Petrarchan or Italian structure of an octave and a sestet. ‘Let
the Bird of Loudest Lay’ and ‘To the Queen’ are both written in trochaic
tetrameters (as is, for example, the Fairies’ song at the end of A
Midsummer Night’s Dream ).</p>
<p>DATE: Venus and Adonis was published in 1593, The Rape of Lucrece in
1594, ‘To the Queen’ was written for a court performance on 20 February
1599. ‘Let the Bird of Loudest Lay’ was commissioned for a book
published in 1601. The date of the sonnets is much disputed: the
published volume was registered for publication in May 1609, but the
vogue for sonneteering was at its height around the 1592–94 closure of
the theatres due to plague. According to Francis Meres, some of
Shakespeare’s ‘sugared sonnets’ were circulating ‘among his private
friends’ in manuscript by 1598 (variant manuscript texts exist for
several of them). Sonnet 107 apparently alludes to Queen Elizabeth’s
death (spring 1603). Analysis of rare words suggests that 1–103 and
127–54 may date from the 1590s, 104–26 from the early 1600s.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Venus and Adonis is based on a story in book 10 of Ovid’s
Metamorphoses , with some use of other Ovidian stories such as those of
the lovely boys Narcissus (book 3) and Hermaphroditus (book 4). Lucrece
derives from book 2 of Ovid’s Fasti and perhaps a translation from
Livy’s History in William Painter’s Pallace of Pleasure (1566). The
sonnets draw on, but also parody, an array of sonneteering conventions
in the tradition that goes back to Petrarch; Ovidian interests such as
desire and narcissism, time and change, and the durability of poetry are
also pervasive.</p>
<p>TEXT: The well-printed 1593 Quarto of Venus and Adonis was reprinted
in 1594, 1595?, 1596, 1599, 1599, 1602?, 1602, 1602, 1617, making it by
a considerable margin Shakespeare’s bestseller in print. The
well-printed 1594 Quarto of Lucrece was a little less popular but still
much in demand (reprinted 1598, 1600, 1600, 1607, 1616). ‘To the Queen’
remained in manuscript until 1972. ‘Let the Bird of Loudest Lay’ was
included in LOVES MARTYR OR, ROSALINS COMPLAINT. Allegorically shadowing
the truth of Loue, in the constant Fate of the Phoenix and Turtle
(1601), a verse collection dedicated to Sir John Salusbury, which
included work by John Marston, George Chapman and Ben Jonson appended to
a long allegorical poem by the little-known Robert Chester;
Shakespeare’s contribution is untitled and only became generally known
as ‘The Phoenix and Turtle’ (i.e. turtle-dove) from 1807. SHAKE-SPEARES
SONNETS. Never before Imprinted was published in 1609, with ‘A Louers
complaint. BY WILLIAM SHAKE-SPEARE’ filling up the final leaves (not
included in this edition). Littered with printing errors, it was little
noticed upon publication and not reprinted. In 1640, John Benson
published a collection of Poems: Written by Wil. Shake-speare. Gent .,
mainly based on the 1609 volume, but with considerable additions and
alterations. The sonnets and poems did not enter the tradition of
‘Complete Works’ Shakespeare until Edmond Malone edited them for his
supplement to the 1778 Samuel Johnson/George Steevens edition.</p>
<p>EXCLUSIONS: The Passionate Pilgrim , a tiny volume containing 20
sonnets and song lyrics, was attributed to Shakespeare on publication in
late 1598 or 1599. It is a mix of five poems by Shakespeare (two of the
sonnets, and three lyrics from Love’s Labour’s Lost ), some by others
and some of uncertain authorship. We exclude it, since the Shakespearean
poems appear elsewhere in our Complete Works , albeit in variant texts.
‘A Lover’s Complaint’ was published with the sonnets and attributed to
Shakespeare, but his authorship has often been doubted, and recent
scholarship (notably Brian Vickers, Shakespeare, ‘A Lover’s Complaint’
and John Davies of Hereford , 2007) has devastated the claim to
Shakespearean authenticity and made a strong case for the authorship of
John Davies of Hereford (1565?–1618), an admirer and imitator of
Shakespeare. Various other short poems, notably several epigrams and
epitaphs, have early attributions to Shakespeare, but none sufficiently
secure to merit inclusion. Edited and annotated texts of The Passionate
Pilgrim and ‘A Lover’s Complaint’ are downloadable from our website,

<p>Saith 19 that the world hath ending with thy life.</p>
<p>’Vouchsafe 20 , thou wonder, to alight 21 thy steed</p>
<p>And rein his proud 22 head to the saddle-bow 23 .</p>
<p>If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed 24</p>
<p>A thousand honey secrets 25 shalt thou know:</p>
<p>Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses,</p>
<p>And being set 26 , I’ll smother thee with kisses.</p>
<p>’And yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety 27 ,</p>
<p>But rather famish them amid their plenty,</p>
<p>Making them red and pale with fresh variety:</p>
<p>Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty.</p>
<p>A summer’s day will seem an hour but short,</p>
<p>Being wasted 28 in such time-beguiling sport 29 .’</p>
<p>With this she seizeth on his sweating 30 palm,</p>
<p>The precedent of pith and livelihood 31 ,</p>
<p>And trembling in her passion, calls it balm 32 ,</p>
<p>Earth’s sovereign 33 salve to do a goddess good:</p>
<p>Being so enraged 34 , desire doth lend her force</p>
<p>Courageously 35 to pluck him from his horse.</p>
<p>Over one arm the lusty 36 courser 37 ’s rein,</p>
<p>Under her other was the tender 38 boy,</p>
<p>Who blushed and pouted in a dull disdain,</p>
<p>With leaden 39 appetite 40 , unapt 41 to toy 42 ,</p>
<p>She red and hot as coals of glowing fire,</p>
<p>He red for shame, but frosty in desire.</p>
<p>The studded 43 bridle on a ragged 44 bough</p>
<p>Nimbly she fastens. O, how quick is love!</p>
<p>The steed is stallèd up 45 , and even now</p>
<p>To tie the rider she begins to prove 46 :</p>
<p>Backward she pushed him, as she would 47 be thrust 48 ,</p>
<p>And governed him in strength though not in lust 49 .</p>
<p>So soon was she along as he was down 50 ,</p>
<p>Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:</p>
<p>Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown</p>
<p>And ’gins to chide 51 , but soon she stops his lips</p>
<p>And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken 52 ,</p>
<p>‘If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.’</p>
<p>He burns with bashful shame, she with her tears</p>
<p>Doth quench the maiden 53 burning of his cheeks,</p>
<p>Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs</p>
<p>To fan and blow them dry again she seeks.</p>
<p>He saith she is immodest, blames her miss 54 :</p>
<p>What follows more, she murders with a kiss.</p>
<p>Even as an empty 55 eagle, sharp by fast 56 ,</p>
<p>Tires 57 with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,</p>
<p>Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,</p>
<p>Till either gorge 58 be stuffed or prey be gone:</p>
<p>Even so she kissed his brow, his cheek, his chin,</p>
<p>And where she ends, she doth anew begin.</p>
<p>Forced to content 59 , but never to obey,</p>
<p>Panting he lies and breatheth in her face.</p>
<p>She feedeth on the steam, as on a pray 60 ,</p>
<p>And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace,</p>
<p>Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers,</p>
<p>So they were dewed with such distilling 61 showers.</p>
<p>Look, how a bird lies tangled in a net,</p>
<p>So fastened in her arms Adonis lies.</p>
<p>Pure shame and awed 62 resistance made him fret 63 ,</p>
<p>Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:</p>
<p>Rain added to a river that is rank 64</p>
<p>Perforce 65 will force it overflow the bank.</p>
<p>Still she entreats and prettily 66 entreats,</p>
<p>For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale.</p>
<p>Still is he sullen, still he lours 67 and frets,</p>
<p>’Twixt 68 crimson shame and anger ashy-pale:</p>
<p>Being red, she loves him best, and being white,</p>
<p>Her best is bettered with a more delight.</p>
<p>Look how he can 69 , she cannot choose but love,</p>
<p>And by her fair immortal hand she swears</p>
<p>From his soft bosom never to remove 70</p>
<p>Till he take truce with her contending 71 tears,</p>
<p>Which long have rained, making her cheeks all wet,</p>
<p>And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless 72 debt.</p>
<p>Upon this promise did he raise his chin,</p>
<p>Like a dive-dapper 73 peering through a wave,</p>
<p>Who, being looked on, ducks as quickly in:</p>
<p>So offers he to give what she did crave,</p>
<p>But when her lips were ready for his pay,</p>
<p>He winks 74 and turns his lips another way.</p>
<p>Never did passenger 75 in summer’s heat</p>
<p>More thirst for drink than she for this good turn 76 .</p>
<p>Her help she sees, but help she cannot get,</p>
<p>She bathes in water 77 , yet her fire must burn:</p>
<p>‘O, pity,’ ’gan she cry, ’flint-hearted boy!</p>
<p>’Tis but a kiss I beg, why art thou coy 78 ?</p>
<p>’I have been wooed, as I entreat thee now,</p>
<p>Even by the stern and direful god of war 79 ,</p>
<p>Whose sinewy 80 neck in battle ne’er did bow 81 ,</p>
<p>Who conquers where he comes in every jar 82 ,</p>
<p>Yet hath he been my captive and my slave</p>
<p>And begged for that which thou unasked shalt have.</p>
<p>’Over my altars hath he hung his lance,</p>
<p>His battered shield, his uncontrollèd 83 crest 84 ,</p>
<p>And for my sake hath learned to sport and dance,</p>
<p>To toy, to wanton, dally 85 , smile and jest,</p>
<p>Scorning his churlish 86 drum and ensign 87 red,</p>
<p>Making my arms 88 his field 89 , his tent my bed.</p>
<p>’Thus he that overruled I overswayed 90 ,</p>
<p>Leading him prisoner in a red rose chain.</p>
<p>Strong-tempered 91 steel his stronger strength obeyed 92 ,</p>
<p>Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.</p>
<p>O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,</p>
<p>For mast’ring her that foiled 93 the god of fight.</p>
<p>’Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine —</p>
<p>Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red —</p>
<p>The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine.</p>
<p>What see’st thou in the ground? Hold up thy head.</p>
<p>Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies 94 ,</p>
<p>Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?</p>
<p>’Art thou ashamed to kiss? Then wink 95 again,</p>
<p>And I will wink, so shall the day seem night.</p>
<p>Love keeps his revels 96 where there are but twain 97 :</p>
<p>Be bold 98 to play, our sport is not in sight 99 .</p>
<p>These blue-veined 100 violets whereon we lean</p>
<p>Never can blab nor know not what we mean.</p>
<p>’The tender spring 101 upon thy tempting lip</p>
<p>Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted.</p>
<p>Make use of time, let not advantage slip,</p>
<p>Beauty within itself should not be wasted.</p>
<p>Fair flowers that are not gathered in their prime</p>
<p>Rot and consume themselves in little time.</p>
<p>’Were I hard-favoured 102 , foul 103 or wrinkled-old,</p>
<p>Ill-nurtured 104 , crooked 105 , churlish, harsh in voice,</p>
<p>O’erworn 106 , despisèd, rheumatic 107 and cold 108 ,</p>
<p>Thick-sighted 109 , barren, lean and lacking juice 110 ,</p>
<p>Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee,</p>
<p>But having no defects, why dost abhor me?</p>
<p>’Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow,</p>
<p>Mine eyes are grey 111 and bright and quick in turning:</p>
<p>My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,</p>
<p>My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow 112 burning,</p>
<p>My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,</p>
<p>Would in thy palm dissolve or seem to melt.</p>
<p>’Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,</p>
<p>Or like a fairy trip 113 upon the green,</p>
<p>Or like a nymph 114 with long dishevelled hair</p>
<p>Dance on the sands and yet no footing 115 seen.</p>
<p>Love is a spirit 116 all compact 117 of fire,</p>
<p>Not gross 118 to sink, but light 119 and will aspire 120 .</p>
<p>’Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie,</p>
<p>These forceless 121 flowers like sturdy trees support me:</p>
<p>Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky</p>
<p>From morn till night, even where I list 122 to sport me.</p>
<p>Is love so light 123 , sweet boy, and may it be</p>
<p>That thou should think it heavy 124 unto thee?</p>
<p>’Is thine own heart to thine own face affected 125 ?</p>
<p>Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left 126 ?</p>
<p>Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected:</p>
<p>Steal thine own freedom and complain on 127 theft.</p>
<p>Narcissus 128 so himself himself forsook 129 ,</p>
<p>And died to kiss his shadow 130 in the brook.</p>
<p>’Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,</p>
<p>Dainties 131 to taste, fresh beauty for the use 132 ,</p>
<p>Herbs for their smell and sappy 133 plants to bear 134 .</p>
<p>Things growing to themselves are growth’s abuse:</p>
<p>Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty.</p>
<p>Thou wast begot: to get 135 it is thy duty.</p>
<p>’Upon the earth’s increase 136 why shouldst thou feed,</p>
<p>Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?</p>
<p>By law of nature thou art bound to breed,</p>
<p>That thine 137 may live when thou thyself art dead:</p>
<p>And so, in spite of death, thou dost survive,</p>
<p>In that thy likeness still is left alive.’</p>
<p>By this 138 the lovesick queen began to sweat,</p>
<p>For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,</p>
<p>And Titan 139 , tirèd 140 in the midday heat,</p>
<p>With burning eye did hotly 141 overlook them,</p>
<p>Wishing Adonis had his team 142 to guide,</p>
<p>So he were like him 143 and by Venus’ side.</p>
<p>And now Adonis with a lazy sprite 144</p>
<p>And with a heavy, dark, disliking 145 eye,</p>
<p>His louring brows o’erwhelming his fair sight 146</p>
<p>Like misty vapours 147 when they blot the sky,</p>
<p>Souring 148 his cheeks, cries, ’Fie, no more of love!</p>
<p>The sun doth burn my face. I must remove.’</p>
<p>‘Ay me,’ quoth Venus, ’young and so unkind,</p>
<p>What bare 149 excuses mak’st thou to be gone!</p>
<p>I’ll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind</p>
<p>Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:</p>
<p>I’ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs,</p>
<p>If they burn too, I’ll quench them with my tears.</p>
<p>’The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,</p>
<p>And, lo, I lie between that sun and thee:</p>
<p>The heat I have from thence doth little harm,</p>
<p>Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me,</p>
<p>And were I not immortal, life were done 150</p>
<p>Between this heavenly and earthly sun 151 .</p>
<p>’Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?</p>
<p>Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth:</p>
<p>Art thou a woman’s son and canst not feel</p>
<p>What ’tis to love, how want 152 of love tormenteth?</p>
<p>O, had thy mother 153 borne so hard a mind,</p>
<p>She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind 154 .</p>
<p>’What am I that thou shouldst contemn 155 me this 156 ?</p>
<p>Or what great danger dwells upon my suit 157 ?</p>
<p>What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?</p>
<p>Speak, fair, but speak fair words or else be mute:</p>
<p>Give me one kiss, I’ll give it thee again,</p>
<p>And one for int’rest, if thou wilt have twain.</p>
<p>’Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,</p>
<p>Well-painted idol, image dull and dead,</p>
<p>Statue 158 contenting but the eye alone,</p>
<p>Thing like a man, but of no woman bred:</p>
<p>Thou art no man, though of a man’s complexion 159 ,</p>
<p>For men will kiss even by their own direction 160 .’</p>
<p>This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,</p>
<p>And swelling passion doth provoke a pause,</p>
<p>Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth 161 her wrong:</p>
<p>Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause 162 ;</p>
<p>And now she weeps and now she fain 163 would speak,</p>
<p>And now her sobs do her intendments 164 break.</p>
<p>Sometime she shakes her head and then his hand,</p>
<p>Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;</p>
<p>Sometime her arms enfold him like a band,</p>
<p>She would 165 , he will not in her arms be bound:</p>
<p>And when from thence he struggles to be gone,</p>
<p>She locks her lily fingers one 166 in one.</p>
<p>‘Fondling 167 ,’ she saith, ’since I have hemmed thee here</p>
<p>Within the circuit of this ivory pale 168 ,</p>
<p>I’ll be a park 169 and thou shalt be my deer 170 :</p>
<p>Feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale 171 ,</p>
<p>Graze on my lips and, if those hills be dry,</p>
<p>Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.</p>
<p>Within this limit 172 is relief 173 enough,</p>
<p>Sweet bottom-grass 174 and high delightful plain 175 ,</p>
<p>Round rising hillocks 176 , brakes 177 obscure 178 and rough,</p>
<p>To shelter thee from tempest and from rain:</p>
<p>Then be my deer, since I am such a park,</p>
<p>No dog shall rouse 179 thee, though a thousand bark.’</p>
<p>At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,</p>
<p>That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple;</p>
<p>Love made those hollows, if 180 himself were slain,</p>
<p>He might be buried in a tomb so simple,</p>
<p>Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,</p>
<p>Why, there love lived and there he could not die.</p>
<p>These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits 181 ,</p>
<p>Opened their mouths to swallow Venus’ liking:</p>
<p>Being mad before, how doth she now for wits 182 ?</p>
<p>Struck dead at first 183 , what needs a second striking?</p>
<p>Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn 184 ,</p>
<p>To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn.</p>
<p>Now which way shall she turn? What shall she say?</p>
<p>Her words are done, her woes are more increasing,</p>
<p>The time is spent, her object will away,</p>
<p>And from her twining arms doth urge releasing:</p>
<p>‘Pity!’ she cries, ‘Some favour, some remorse 185 !’</p>
<p>Away he springs and hasteth to his horse.</p>
<p>But, lo, from forth a copse that neighbours by 186 ,</p>
<p>A breeding 187 jennet 188 , lusty 189 , young and proud 190 ,</p>
<p>Adonis’ trampling courser 191 doth espy,</p>
<p>And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud.</p>
<p>The strong-necked steed, being tied unto a tree,</p>
<p>Breaketh his rein and to her straight 192 goes he.</p>
<p>Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,</p>
<p>And now his woven girths 193 he breaks asunder,</p>
<p>The bearing 194 earth with his hard hoof he wounds,</p>
<p>Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven’s thunder,</p>
<p>The iron bit he crusheth ’tween his teeth,</p>
<p>Controlling what he was controllèd with.</p>
<p>His ears up-pricked, his braided hanging mane</p>
<p>Upon his compassed crest 195 now stand on end,</p>
<p>His nostrils drink the air and forth again,</p>
<p>As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:</p>
<p>His eye, which scornfully glisters 196 like fire,</p>
<p>Shows his hot courage 197 and his high desire.</p>
<p>Sometime he trots, as if he told 198 the steps</p>
<p>With gentle 199 majesty and modest pride,</p>
<p>Anon 200 he rears upright, curvets 201 and leaps,</p>
<p>As who should 202 say, ’Lo, thus my strength is tried 203</p>
<p>And this I do to captivate the eye</p>
<p>Of the fair breeder that is standing by.’</p>
<p>What recketh he 204 his rider’s angry stir 205 ,</p>
<p>His flattering 206 ‘Holla 207’, or his ‘Stand, I say’?</p>
<p>What cares he now for curb 208 or pricking spur?</p>
<p>For rich caparisons 209 or trappings gay 210 ?</p>
<p>He sees his love and nothing else he sees,</p>
<p>For nothing else with his proud sight agrees.</p>
<p>Look when a painter would surpass the life</p>
<p>In limning out 211 a well-proportioned steed,</p>
<p>His art with nature’s workmanship at strife,</p>
<p>As if the dead the living should exceed:</p>
<p>So did this horse excel a common one</p>
<p>In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone 212 .</p>
<p>Round-hoofed, short-jointed, fetlocks 213 shag 214 and long,</p>
<p>Broad breast, full eye, small head and nostril wide,</p>
<p>High crest 215 , short ears, straight legs and passing 216
strong,</p>
<p>Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:</p>
<p>Look what a horse should have he did not lack,</p>
<p>Save a proud rider on so proud a back.</p>
<p>Sometime he scuds 217 far off and there he stares,</p>
<p>Anon he starts at stirring of a feather:</p>
<p>To bid the wind a base 218 he now prepares,</p>
<p>And where 219 he run or fly they know not whether:</p>
<p>For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,</p>
<p>Fanning the hairs, who 220 wave like feathered wings.</p>
<p>He looks upon his love and neighs unto her,</p>
<p>She answers him as if she knew his mind:</p>
<p>Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,</p>
<p>She puts on outward strangeness 221 , seems unkind 222 ,</p>
<p>Spurns at 223 his love and scorns the heat he feels,</p>
<p>Beating his kind embracements 224 with her heels 225 .</p>
<p>Then, like a melancholy malcontent,</p>
<p>He vails 226 his tail 227 that like a falling plume 228</p>
<p>Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent.</p>
<p>He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume 229 :</p>
<p>His love, perceiving how he was enraged,</p>
<p>Grew kinder and his fury was assuaged.</p>
<p>His testy 230 master goeth about to take him,</p>
<p>When, lo, the unbacked 231 breeder 232 , full of fear,</p>
<p>Jealous of catching 233 , swiftly doth forsake 234 him,</p>
<p>With her the horse, and left Adonis there:</p>
<p>As 235 they were mad, unto the wood 236 they hie them 237 ,</p>
<p>Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them.</p>
<p>All swoll’n with chafing 238 , down Adonis sits,</p>
<p>Banning 239 his boist’rous and unruly beast;</p>
<p>And now the happy season once more fits 240</p>
<p>That lovesick love 241 by pleading may be blest:</p>
<p>For lovers say the heart hath treble wrong</p>
<p>When it is barred the aidance 242 of the tongue.</p>
<p>An oven that is stopped 243 or river stayed 244</p>
<p>Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:</p>
<p>So 245 of concealèd sorrow may be said</p>
<p>Free vent 246 of words love’s fire doth assuage,</p>
<p>But when the heart’s attorney 247 once is mute,</p>
<p>The client 248 breaks 249 , as 250 desperate in his suit 251 .</p>
<p>He sees her coming and begins to glow,</p>
<p>Even as a dying coal revives with wind,</p>
<p>And with his bonnet 252 hides his angry brow,</p>
<p>Looks on the dull earth with disturbèd mind,</p>
<p>Taking no notice that she is so nigh 253 ,</p>
<p>For all askance he holds her in his eye 254 .</p>
<p>O, what a sight it was, wistly 255 to view</p>
<p>How she came stealing to the wayward 256 boy,</p>
<p>To note the fighting conflict of her hue,</p>
<p>How white and red each other did destroy:</p>
<p>But 257 now her cheek was pale and by and by</p>
<p>It flashed forth fire, as lightning from the sky.</p>
<p>Now was she just before 258 him as he sat,</p>
<p>And like a lowly lover down she kneels,</p>
<p>With one fair hand she heaveth 259 up his hat,</p>
<p>Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:</p>
<p>His tend’rer cheek receives her soft hand’s print,</p>
<p>As apt 260 as new-fall’n snow takes any dint 261 .</p>
<p>O, what a war of looks was then between them,</p>
<p>Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing 262 ,</p>
<p>His eyes saw her eyes, as 263 they had not seen them,</p>
<p>Her eyes wooed still, his eyes disdained the wooing:</p>
<p>And all this dumb play 264 had his 265 acts made plain 266</p>
<p>With tears, which chorus-like 267 her eyes did rain.</p>
<p>Full 268 gently now she takes him by the hand,</p>
<p>A lily prisoned 269 in a jail 270 of snow,</p>
<p>Or ivory in an alabaster band 271 ,</p>
<p>So white a friend engirts 272 so white a foe:</p>
<p>This beauteous combat, wilful 273 and unwilling,</p>
<p>Showed like two silver doves that sit a-billing 274 .</p>
<p>Once more the engine 275 of her thoughts began,</p>
<p>’O fairest mover 276 on this mortal round 277 ,</p>
<p>Would thou wert 278 as I am, and I a man,</p>
<p>My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound 279 ,</p>
<p>For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee 280 ,</p>
<p>Though nothing but my body’s bane 281 would cure thee.’</p>
<p>‘Give me my hand,’ saith he, ‘why dost thou feel it?’</p>
<p>‘Give me my heart’, saith she, ’and thou shalt have it.</p>
<p>O, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel 282 it,</p>
<p>And being steeled, soft sighs can never grave 283 it.</p>
<p>Then love’s deep groans I never shall regard 284 ,</p>
<p>Because Adonis’ heart hath made mine hard.’</p>
<p>‘For shame!’ he cries, ’Let go and let me go:</p>
<p>My day’s delight is past, my horse is gone,</p>
<p>And ’tis your fault I am bereft 285 him so.</p>
<p>I pray you hence 286 and leave me here alone,</p>
<p>For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,</p>
<p>Is how to get my palfrey 287 from the mare.’</p>
<p>Thus she replies, ’Thy palfrey, as he should,</p>
<p>Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire:</p>
<p>Affection 288 is a coal that must be cooled,</p>
<p>Else, suffered 289 , it will set the heart on fire.</p>
<p>The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none,</p>
<p>Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.</p>
<p>’How like a jade 290 he stood, tied to the tree,</p>
<p>Servilely mastered with a leathern rein,</p>
<p>But when he saw his love, his youth’s fair fee 291 ,</p>
<p>He held such petty bondage in disdain,</p>
<p>Throwing the base thong 292 from his bending crest 293 ,</p>
<p>Enfranchising 294 his mouth, his back, his breast.</p>
<p>’Who sees his true-love in her naked bed 295 ,</p>
<p>Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,</p>
<p>But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,</p>
<p>His other agents 296 aim at like 297 delight?</p>
<p>Who is so faint 298 that dares not be so bold 299</p>
<p>To touch the fire, the weather being cold?</p>
<p>’Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy,</p>
<p>And learn of 300 him, I heartily beseech thee,</p>
<p>To take advantage on 301 presented 302 joy.</p>
<p>Though 303 I were dumb, yet 304 his proceedings 305 teach thee.</p>
<p>O, learn to love: the lesson is but plain,</p>
<p>And once made perfect 306 , never lost again.’</p>
<p>‘I know not love,’ quoth 307 he, ’nor will not know it,</p>
<p>Unless it be a boar and then I chase it,</p>
<p>’Tis much to borrow and I will not owe 308 it.</p>
<p>My love to love is love but to disgrace it 309 ,</p>
<p>For I have heard it is a life in death,</p>
<p>That laughs and weeps and all but with a breath 310 .</p>
<p>’Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinished?</p>
<p>Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?</p>
<p>If springing 311 things be any jot diminished 312 ,</p>
<p>They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth:</p>
<p>The colt that’s backed and burdened 313 being young</p>
<p>Loseth his pride and never waxeth 314 strong.</p>
<p>’You hurt my hand with wringing, let us part</p>
<p>And leave this idle 315 theme, this bootless 316 chat.</p>
<p>Remove your siege from my unyielding heart:</p>
<p>To love’s alarms 317 it will not ope 318 the gate.</p>
<p>Dismiss your vows, your feignèd tears, your flattery,</p>
<p>For where a heart is hard they make no battery 319 .’</p>
<p>‘What, canst thou talk?’ quoth she, ’Hast thou a tongue?</p>
<p>O, would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing.</p>
<p>Thy mermaid’s 320 voice hath done me double wrong:</p>
<p>I had my load before, now pressed 321 with bearing:</p>
<p>Melodious discord, heavenly tune harsh sounding,</p>
<p>Ear’s deep-sweet music and heart’s deep-sore wounding.</p>
<p>’Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love</p>
<p>That inward beauty and invisible 322 ,</p>
<p>Or were I deaf, thy outward parts 323 would move 324</p>
<p>Each part in me that were but sensible 325 :</p>
<p>Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,</p>
<p>Yet should I be in love by touching thee.</p>
<p>’Say that the sense of feeling were bereft me,</p>
<p>And that I could not see nor hear nor touch,</p>
<p>And nothing but the very smell were left me,</p>
<p>Yet would my love to thee be still as much:</p>
<p>For from the stillatory 326 of thy face excelling 327</p>
<p>Comes breath perfumed that breedeth love by smelling.</p>
<p>’But O, what banquet wert thou to the taste,</p>
<p>Being nurse and feeder of the other four 328 .</p>
<p>Would they not wish the feast might ever last</p>
<p>And bid suspicion 329 double-lock the door,</p>
<p>Lest jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,</p>
<p>Should by his stealing in disturb the feast?’</p>
<p>Once more the ruby-coloured portal 330 opened,</p>
<p>Which to his speech did honey passage yield,</p>
<p>Like a red morn that ever yet betokened</p>
<p>Wrack 331 to the seaman, tempest to the field,</p>
<p>Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,</p>
<p>Gusts and foul flaws 332 to herdmen and to herds.</p>
<p>This ill presage 333 advisedly 334 she marketh 335 ,</p>
<p>Even as the wind is hushed before it raineth,</p>
<p>Or as the wolf doth grin 336 before he barketh,</p>
<p>Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,</p>
<p>Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,</p>
<p>His meaning struck her ere 337 his words begun.</p>
<p>And at his look she flatly 338 falleth down,</p>
<p>For looks kill love and love by looks reviveth:</p>
<p>A smile recures 339 the wounding of a frown.</p>
<p>But blessèd bankrupt that by love 340 so thriveth 341 ,</p>
<p>The silly boy, believing she is dead,</p>
<p>Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red,</p>
<p>And all amazed brake off his late intent 342 ,</p>
<p>For sharply he did think to reprehend her,</p>
<p>Which cunning 343 love did wittily 344 prevent:</p>
<p>Fair fall 345 the wit that can so well defend her!</p>
<p>For on the grass she lies as she were slain,</p>
<p>Till his breath breatheth life in her again.</p>
<p>He wrings 346 her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,</p>
<p>He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,</p>
<p>He chafes her lips: a thousand ways he seeks</p>
<p>To mend the hurt that his unkindness marred.</p>
<p>He kisses her and she, by her good will,</p>
<p>Will never rise, so he will kiss her still 347 .</p>
<p>The night of sorrow now is turned to day.</p>
<p>Her two blue windows 348 faintly she upheaveth,</p>
<p>Like the fair sun when in his fresh array</p>
<p>He cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth:</p>
<p>And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,</p>
<p>So is her face illumined with her eye,</p>
<p>Whose beams upon his hairless face are fixed,</p>
<p>As if from thence they borrowed all their shine.</p>
<p>Were never four such lamps together mixed,</p>
<p>Had not his clouded with his brow’s repine 349 ,</p>
<p>But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light,</p>
<p>Shone like the moon in water seen by night.</p>
<p>‘O, where am I?’ quoth she, ’In earth or heaven,</p>
<p>Or in the ocean drenched 350 or in the fire?</p>
<p>What hour is this? Or 351 morn or weary even?</p>
<p>Do I delight to die or life desire?</p>
<p>But now I lived and life was death’s annoy 352 ,</p>
<p>But now I died and death was lively joy.</p>
<p>’O, thou didst kill me! Kill me once again!</p>
<p>Thy eyes’ shrewd 353 tutor, that hard heart of thine,</p>
<p>Hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain</p>
<p>That they have murdered this poor heart of mine,</p>
<p>And these mine eyes, true leaders 354 to their queen,</p>
<p>But 355 for thy piteous 356 lips no more had seen.</p>
<p>’Long may they kiss each other for this cure!</p>
<p>O, never let their crimson liveries 357 wear 358 ,</p>
<p>And as they last, their verdure 359 still endure</p>
<p>To drive infection from the dangerous year</p>
<p>That the star-gazers 360 , having writ on death,</p>
<p>May say the plague 361 is banished by thy breath.</p>
<p>’Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted 362 ,</p>
<p>What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?</p>
<p>To sell myself 363 I can be well contented,</p>
<p>So 364 thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing 365 ,</p>
<p>Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips 366</p>
<p>Set thy seal-manual 367 on my wax-red lips.</p>
<p>’A thousand kisses buys my heart from me,</p>
<p>And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.</p>
<p>What is ten hundred touches 368 unto thee?</p>
<p>Are they not quickly told 369 and quickly gone?</p>
<p>Say for non-payment that the debt should double,</p>
<p>Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?’</p>
<p>‘Fair queen 370 ,’ quoth he, ’if any love you owe 371 me,</p>
<p>Measure my strangeness with 372 my unripe years,</p>
<p>Before I know 373 myself, seek not to know me.</p>
<p>No fisher but the ungrown fry 374 forbears 375 :</p>
<p>The mellow 376 plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,</p>
<p>Or being early plucked is sour to taste.</p>
<p>’Look, the world’s comforter 377 with weary gait</p>
<p>His day’s hot task hath ended in the west,</p>
<p>The owl, night’s herald, shrieks 378 , ’tis very late,</p>
<p>The sheep are gone to fold 379 , birds to their nest,</p>
<p>And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven’s light</p>
<p>Do summon us to part and bid good night.</p>
<p>‘Now let me say’‘Goodnight’’, and so say you:</p>
<p>If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.’</p>
<p>‘Goodnight’, quoth she and ere he says ‘Adieu’</p>
<p>The honey fee of parting tendered 380 is.</p>
<p>Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace:</p>
<p>Incorp’rate 381 then they seem, face grows to face,</p>
<p>Till, breathless, he disjoined 382 and backward drew</p>
<p>The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,</p>
<p>Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,</p>
<p>Whereon they surfeit 383 , yet complain on drouth 384 :</p>
<p>He with her plenty 385 pressed 386 , she faint with dearth 387 ,</p>
<p>Their lips together glued, fall to the earth.</p>
<p>Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,</p>
<p>And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth.</p>
<p>Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,</p>
<p>Paying what ransom the insulter 388 willeth,</p>
<p>Whose vulture 389 thought doth pitch 390 the price so high</p>
<p>That she will draw his lips’ rich treasure dry.</p>
<p>And having felt the sweetness of the spoil 391 ,</p>
<p>With blindfold fury she begins to forage 392 :</p>
<p>Her face doth reek 393 and smoke 394 , her blood doth boil,</p>
<p>And careless 395 lust stirs up a desperate courage,</p>
<p>Planting oblivion 396 , beating reason back,</p>
<p>Forgetting shame’s pure blush and honour’s wrack 397 .</p>
<p>Hot, faint and weary, with her hard embracing,</p>
<p>Like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling,</p>
<p>Or as the fleet-foot roe 398 that’s tired with chasing 399 ,</p>
<p>Or like the froward 400 infant stilled with dandling 401 ,</p>
<p>He now obeys and now no more resisteth,</p>
<p>While she takes all she can, not all she listeth 402 .</p>
<p>What wax so 403 frozen but dissolves with temp’ring 404 ,</p>
<p>And yields at last to every light impression?</p>
<p>Things out of hope 405 are compassed 406 oft with vent’ring 407 ,</p>
<p>Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission 408 :</p>
<p>Affection faints not like a pale-faced coward,</p>
<p>But then woos best, when most his choice 409 is froward.</p>
<p>When he did frown, O, had she then gave over 410 ,</p>
<p>Such nectar from his lips she had not sucked.</p>
<p>Foul 411 words and frowns must not repel a lover:</p>
<p>What though the rose have prickles, yet ’tis plucked 412 !</p>
<p>Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast 413 ,</p>
<p>Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.</p>
<p>For pity now she can no more detain him:</p>
<p>The poor fool prays her that he may depart.</p>
<p>She is resolved no longer to 414 restrain him,</p>
<p>Bids him farewell and look well to her heart,</p>
<p>The which, by Cupid 415 ’s bow she doth protest 416 ,</p>
<p>He carries thence incagèd in his breast.</p>
<p>‘Sweet boy,’ she says, ’this night I’ll waste 417 in sorrow,</p>
<p>For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch 418 .</p>
<p>Tell me, love’s master, shall we meet tomorrow?</p>
<p>Say, shall we? Shall we? Wilt thou make the match 419 ?’</p>
<p>He tells her, ‘No’, tomorrow he intends</p>
<p>To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.</p>
<p>‘The boar?’ quoth she, whereat a sudden pale,</p>
<p>Like lawn 420 being spread upon the blushing rose,</p>
<p>Usurps her cheek: she trembles at his tale</p>
<p>And on his neck her yoking 421 arms she throws.</p>
<p>She sinketh down still hanging by his neck,</p>
<p>He on her belly falls, she on her back.</p>
<p>Now is she in the very lists 422 of love,</p>
<p>Her champion 423 mounted 424 for the hot encounter 425 :</p>
<p>All is imaginary she doth prove 426 ,</p>
<p>He will not manage 427 her, although he mount her,</p>
<p>That 428 worse than Tantalus 429 ’ is her annoy,</p>
<p>To clip 430 Elysium 431 and to lack her joy.</p>
<p>Even so poor birds, deceived with painted grapes 432 ,</p>
<p>Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw 433 :</p>
<p>Even so she languisheth in her mishaps 434 ,</p>
<p>As those poor birds that helpless 435 berries saw.</p>
<p>The warm effects 436 , which she in him finds missing,</p>
<p>She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.</p>
<p>But all in vain: good queen, it will not be.</p>
<p>She hath assayed 437 as much as may be proved 438 .</p>
<p>Her pleading hath deserved a greater fee:</p>
<p>She’s love, she loves and yet she is not loved.</p>
<p>‘Fie 439 , fie!’ he says, ’You crush me! Let me go!</p>
<p>You have no reason to withhold me so.’</p>
<p>‘Thou hadst 440 been gone’, quoth she, ’sweet boy, ere this,</p>
<p>But that thou told’st me thou wouldst hunt the boar.</p>
<p>O, be advised 441 ! Thou know’st not what it is</p>
<p>With javelin’s point a churlish 442 swine to gore,</p>
<p>Whose tushes 443 never sheathed he whetteth still 444 ,</p>
<p>Like to a mortal 445 butcher bent 446 to kill.</p>
<p>’On his bow-back 447 he hath a battle 448 set</p>
<p>Of bristly pikes 449 that ever threat his foes,</p>
<p>His eyes like glow-worms shine when he doth fret 450 ,</p>
<p>His snout digs sepulchres 451 where’er he goes:</p>
<p>Being moved 452 , he strikes whate’er is in his way,</p>
<p>And whom he strikes, his crooked tushes slay.</p>
<p>’His brawny 453 sides with hairy bristles armed</p>
<p>Are better proof 454 than thy spear’s point can enter,</p>
<p>His short thick neck cannot be easily harmed,</p>
<p>Being ireful 455 on the lion he will venture 456 :</p>
<p>The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,</p>
<p>As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.</p>
<p>’Alas, he nought esteems that face of thine,</p>
<p>To which love’s eyes pays tributary 457 gazes,</p>
<p>Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips and crystal eyne 458 ,</p>
<p>Whose full perfection all the world amazes,</p>
<p>But having thee at vantage 459 — wondrous dread! —</p>
<p>Would root 460 these beauties as he roots the mead 461 .</p>
<p>’O, let him keep his loathsome cabin 462 still:</p>
<p>Beauty hath nought to do with such foul 463 fiends.</p>
<p>Come not within his danger by thy will 464 :</p>
<p>They that thrive well take counsel of their friends.</p>
<p>When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble 465 ,</p>
<p>I feared thy fortune and my joints did tremble.</p>
<p>’Didst thou not mark my face? Was it not white?</p>
<p>Saw’st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye?</p>
<p>Grew I not faint? And fell I not downright 466 ?</p>
<p>Within my bosom whereon thou dost lie,</p>
<p>My boding 467 heart pants, beats and takes no rest,</p>
<p>But like an earthquake shakes thee on my breast.</p>
<p>’For where love reigns, disturbing jealousy 468</p>
<p>Doth call himself affection’s sentinel 469 ,</p>
<p>Gives false alarms, suggesteth 470 mutiny,</p>
<p>And in a peaceful hour doth cry ‘Kill, kill!’</p>
<p>Distemp’ring 471 gentle love in his desire,</p>
<p>As air and water do abate 472 the fire.</p>
<p>’This sour informer, this bate-breeding 473 spy,</p>
<p>This canker 474 that eats up love’s tender spring 475 ,</p>
<p>This carry-tale 476 , dissentious 477 jealousy,</p>
<p>That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,</p>
<p>Knocks at my heart and whispers in mine ear</p>
<p>That if I love thee, I thy death should fear,</p>
<p>’And more than so 478 , presenteth to mine eye</p>
<p>The picture of an angry, chafing boar,</p>
<p>Under whose sharp fangs on his 479 back doth lie</p>
<p>An image like thyself, all stained with gore,</p>
<p>Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed</p>
<p>Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.</p>
<p>’What should I do, seeing thee so indeed 480 ,</p>
<p>That 481 tremble at th’imagination?</p>
<p>The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,</p>
<p>And fear doth teach it divination 482 ;</p>
<p>I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,</p>
<p>If thou encounter with the boar tomorrow.</p>
<p>’But if thou needs wilt 483 hunt, be ruled by me,</p>
<p>Uncouple 484 at the timorous flying 485 hare,</p>
<p>Or at the fox which lives by subtlety 486 ,</p>
<p>Or at the roe 487 which no encounter 488 dare:</p>
<p>Pursue these fearful creatures o’er the downs,</p>
<p>And on thy well-breathed 489 horse keep with thy hounds.</p>
<p>’And when thou hast on foot 490 the purblind 491 hare,</p>
<p>Mark the poor wretch: to overshoot 492 his troubles,</p>
<p>How he outruns the wind and with what care</p>
<p>He cranks and crosses 493 with a thousand doubles 494 .</p>
<p>The many musets 495 through the which he goes</p>
<p>Are like a labyrinth to amaze 496 his foes.</p>
<p>’Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep</p>
<p>To make the cunning 497 hounds mistake their smell,</p>
<p>And sometime where earth-delving conies 498 keep 499</p>
<p>To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,</p>
<p>And sometime sorteth 500 with a herd of deer —</p>
<p>Danger deviseth shifts 501 , wit waits on 502 fear —</p>
<p>’For there his smell with others being mingled,</p>
<p>The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,</p>
<p>Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled</p>
<p>With much ado 503 the cold fault 504 cleanly out.</p>
<p>Then do they spend their mouths 505 : echo 506 replies,</p>
<p>As if another chase were in the skies.</p>
<p>’By this, poor Wat 507 , far off upon a hill,</p>
<p>Stands on his hinder legs with list’ning ear</p>
<p>To harken if his foes pursue him still.</p>
<p>Anon their loud alarums 508 he doth hear,</p>
<p>And now his grief may be comparèd well</p>
<p>To one sore 509 sick that hears the passing-bell 510 .</p>
<p>’Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled 511 wretch</p>
<p>Turn and return 512 , indenting 513 with the way.</p>
<p>Each envious 514 briar his weary legs do scratch,</p>
<p>Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:</p>
<p>For misery is trodden on by many</p>
<p>And, being low, never relieved 515 by any.</p>
<p>’Lie quietly and hear a little more —</p>
<p>Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise —</p>
<p>To make thee hate the hunting of the boar:</p>
<p>Unlike myself 516 thou hear’st me moralize 517 ,</p>
<p>Applying this to that and so to so —</p>
<p>For love can comment upon every woe.</p>
<p>‘Where did I leave 518 ?’ ‘No matter where’, quoth he,</p>
<p>’Leave me and then the story aptly 519 ends:</p>
<p>The night is spent.’ ‘Why, what of that?’ quoth she.</p>
<p>‘I am’, quoth he, ’expected of 520 my friends,</p>
<p>And now ‘tis dark and going I shall fall.’</p>
<p>‘In night’, quoth she, ’desire sees best of all.</p>
<p>’But if thou fall, O then imagine this,</p>
<p>The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,</p>
<p>And all is but to rob thee of a kiss.</p>
<p>Rich preys make true 521 men thieves: so do thy lips</p>
<p>Make modest Dian 522 cloudy and forlorn,</p>
<p>Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn 523 .</p>
<p>’Now of this dark night I perceive the reason 524 :</p>
<p>Cynthia 525 for shame obscures her silver shine,</p>
<p>Till forging 526 nature be condemned of treason</p>
<p>For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine,</p>
<p>Wherein she framed 527 thee, in high heaven’s despite 528 ,</p>
<p>To shame the sun by day and her by night.</p>
<p>’And therefore hath she bribed the destinies 529</p>
<p>To cross 530 the curious 531 workmanship of nature,</p>
<p>To mingle beauty with infirmities</p>
<p>And pure perfection with impure defeature 532 ,</p>
<p>Making it subject to the tyranny</p>
<p>Of mad mischances 533 and much misery,</p>
<p>’As burning fevers, agues 534 pale and faint,</p>
<p>Life-poisoning pestilence 535 and frenzies wood 536 ,</p>
<p>The marrow-eating sickness 537 whose attaint 538</p>
<p>Disorder 539 breeds by heating of the blood 540 ,</p>
<p>Surfeits 541 , impostumes 542 , grief and damned despair:</p>
<p>Swear nature’s death for framing thee so fair.</p>
<p>’And not the least of all these maladies</p>
<p>But in one minute’s fight brings beauty under:</p>
<p>Both favour 543 , savour 544 , hue 545 and qualities,</p>
<p>Whereat th’impartial gazer late did wonder,</p>
<p>Are on the sudden wasted, thawed and done,</p>
<p>As mountain snow melts with the midday sun.</p>
<p>’Therefore, despite of fruitless 546 chastity,</p>
<p>Love-lacking vestals 547 and self-loving 548 nuns</p>
<p>That on the earth would breed a scarcity</p>
<p>And barren dearth 549 of daughters and of sons,</p>
<p>Be prodigal 550 : the lamp that burns by night</p>
<p>Dries up his oil 551 to lend the world his light.</p>
<p>’What is thy body but a swallowing grave,</p>
<p>Seeming to bury that posterity</p>
<p>Which by the rights of time thou needs must have,</p>
<p>If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity 552 ?</p>
<p>If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,</p>
<p>Sith 553 in thy pride 554 so fair a hope is slain 555 .</p>
<p>’So in thyself thyself art made away 556 ,</p>
<p>A mischief 557 worse than civil home-bred strife,</p>
<p>Or theirs whose desperate 558 hands themselves do slay 559 ,</p>
<p>Or butcher-sire 560 that reaves 561 his son of life:</p>
<p>Foul-cank’ring 562 rust the hidden treasure 563 frets 564 ,</p>
<p>But gold that’s put to use 565 more gold begets.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, then,’ quoth Adon, ’you will fall 566 again</p>
<p>Into your idle over-handled 567 theme;</p>
<p>The kiss I gave you is bestowed in vain,</p>
<p>And all in vain you strive against the stream,</p>
<p>For, by this black-faced night, desire’s foul 568 nurse,</p>
<p>Your treatise 569 makes me like you worse and worse.</p>
<p>’If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,</p>
<p>And every tongue more moving 570 than your own,</p>
<p>Bewitching like the wanton 571 mermaids’ songs,</p>
<p>Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown:</p>
<p>For know, my heart stands armèd in mine ear</p>
<p>And will not let a false sound enter there,</p>
<p>’Lest 572 the deceiving harmony should run</p>
<p>Into the quiet closure 573 of my breast,</p>
<p>And then my little heart were quite undone 574 ,</p>
<p>In his bedchamber to be barred of rest:</p>
<p>No, lady, no! My heart longs not to groan,</p>
<p>But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.</p>
<p>’What have you urged that I cannot reprove 575 ?</p>
<p>The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger:</p>
<p>I hate not love, but your device 576 in love</p>
<p>That lends embracements unto every stranger —</p>
<p>You do it for increase? O strange excuse,</p>
<p>When reason is the bawd 577 to lust’s abuse!</p>
<p>’Call it not love, for love to heaven is fled,</p>
<p>Since sweating lust on earth usurped his name,</p>
<p>Under whose simple semblance 578 he hath fed</p>
<p>Upon fresh beauty, blotting 579 it with blame,</p>
<p>Which 580 the hot tyrant 581 stains 582 and soon bereaves 583 ,</p>
<p>As caterpillars do the tender leaves.</p>
<p>’Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,</p>
<p>But lust’s effect is tempest after sun:</p>
<p>Love’s gentle spring doth always fresh remain,</p>
<p>Lust’s winter comes ere summer half be done:</p>
<p>Love surfeits not, lust like a glutton dies:</p>
<p>Love is all truth, lust full of forgèd lies.</p>
<p>’More I could tell, but more I dare not say:</p>
<p>The text 584 is old, the orator too green 585 .</p>
<p>Therefore in sadness now I will away.</p>
<p>My face is full of shame, my heart of teen 586 ,</p>
<p>Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended,</p>
<p>Do burn themselves for having so offended.’</p>
<p>With this, he breaketh from the sweet embrace</p>
<p>Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast</p>
<p>And homeward through the dark laund 587 runs apace 588 ,</p>
<p>Leaves love upon her back deeply distressed.</p>
<p>Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky,</p>
<p>So glides he in the night from Venus’ eye 589 ,</p>
<p>Which after him she darts, as one on shore</p>
<p>Gazing upon a late-embarkèd 590 friend 591</p>
<p>Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,</p>
<p>Whose ridges 592 with the meeting clouds contend 593 ;</p>
<p>So did the merciless and pitchy 594 night</p>
<p>Fold in 595 the object that did feed her sight.</p>
<p>Whereat amazed, as one that unaware</p>
<p>Hath dropped a precious jewel in the flood 596 ,</p>
<p>Or stonished 597 as night-wand’rers often are,</p>
<p>Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood,</p>
<p>Even so confounded 598 in the dark she lay,</p>
<p>Having lost the fair discovery of her way 599 .</p>
<p>And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,</p>
<p>That all the neighbour 600 caves, as seeming troubled,</p>
<p>Make verbal repetition of 601 her moans:</p>
<p>Passion 602 on passion deeply 603 is redoubled,</p>
<p>‘Ay me!’ she cries and twenty times, ‘Woe, woe!’</p>
<p>And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.</p>
<p>She, marking them, begins a wailing note</p>
<p>And sings extemporally 604 a woeful ditty:</p>
<p>How love makes young men thrall 605 and old men dote 606 ,</p>
<p>How love is wise in folly, foolish-witty.</p>
<p>Her heavy 607 anthem 608 still concludes in woe,</p>
<p>And still the choir of echoes answer so.</p>
<p>Her song was tedious and outwore the night,</p>
<p>For lovers’ hours are long, though seeming short:</p>
<p>If pleased themselves, others, they think, delight</p>
<p>In suchlike circumstance, with suchlike sport:</p>
<p>Their copious 609 stories, oftentimes begun,</p>
<p>End without audience and are never done.</p>
<p>For who hath she to spend the night withal 610</p>
<p>But idle sounds resembling parasites 611 ,</p>
<p>Like shrill-tongued tapsters 612 answering every call,</p>
<p>Soothing the humour 613 of fantastic wits 614 ?</p>
<p>She says ‘’Tis so’. They answer all ‘’Tis so’,</p>
<p>And would say after her, if she said ‘No’.</p>
<p>Lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest,</p>
<p>From his moist cabinet 615 mounts up on high</p>
<p>And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast</p>
<p>The sun ariseth in his majesty,</p>
<p>Who doth the world so gloriously behold</p>
<p>That cedar tops and hills seem burnished gold.</p>
<p>Venus salutes him with this fair good-morrow,</p>
<p>’O thou clear 616 god and patron of all light,</p>
<p>From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow</p>
<p>The beauteous influence 617 that makes him bright,</p>
<p>There lives a son 618 that sucked an earthly mother</p>
<p>May 619 lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.’</p>
<p>This said, she hasteth to a myrtle 620 grove,</p>
<p>Musing the morning is so much o’erworn 621 ,</p>
<p>And yet she hears no tidings of her love.</p>
<p>She hearkens 622 for his hounds and for his horn:</p>
<p>Anon she hears them chant it lustily,</p>
<p>And all in haste she coasteth 623 to the cry 624 .</p>
<p>And as she runs, the bushes in the way</p>
<p>Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,</p>
<p>Some twined about her thigh to make her stay.</p>
<p>She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace</p>
<p>Like a milch doe 625 , whose swelling dugs 626 do ache,</p>
<p>Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake 627 .</p>
<p>By this she hears the hounds are at a bay 628 ,</p>
<p>Whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder</p>
<p>Wreathed up in fatal folds 629 just in his way,</p>
<p>The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder:</p>
<p>Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds</p>
<p>Appals 630 her senses and her spirit confounds 631 .</p>
<p>For now she knows it is no gentle chase 632 ,</p>
<p>But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,</p>
<p>Because the cry remaineth in one place,</p>
<p>Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud:</p>
<p>Finding their enemy to be so curst 633 ,</p>
<p>They all strain court’sy 634 who shall cope 635 him first.</p>
<p>This dismal 636 cry rings sadly in her ear,</p>
<p>Through which it enters to surprise 637 her heart,</p>
<p>Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,</p>
<p>With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part:</p>
<p>Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,</p>
<p>They basely fly 638 and dare not stay the field 639 .</p>
<p>Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy 640 ,</p>
<p>Till, cheering up her senses all dismayed,</p>
<p>She tells them ’tis a causeless fantasy</p>
<p>And childish error that they are afraid,</p>
<p>Bids 641 them leave quaking, bids them fear no more—</p>
<p>And with that word she spied the hunted boar,</p>
<p>Whose frothy 642 mouth, bepainted all with red,</p>
<p>Like milk and blood being mingled both together,</p>
<p>A second fear through all her sinews 643 spread,</p>
<p>Which madly hurries her she knows not whither.</p>
<p>This way runs and now she will no further,</p>
<p>But back retires to rate 644 the boar for murther 645 .</p>
<p>A thousand spleens 646 bear her a thousand ways,</p>
<p>She treads the path that she untreads again.</p>
<p>Her more than haste is mated 647 with delays,</p>
<p>Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,</p>
<p>Full of respects 648 , yet naught at all respecting 649 ,</p>
<p>In hand 650 with all things, naught at all effecting.</p>
<p>Here kennelled in a brake she finds a hound</p>
<p>And asks the weary caitiff 651 for his master,</p>
<p>And there another licking of his wound,</p>
<p>Gainst venomed sores the only sovereign plaster 652 .</p>
<p>And here she meets another, sadly scowling,</p>
<p>To whom she speaks and he replies with howling.</p>
<p>When he hath ceased his ill-resounding 653 noise,</p>
<p>Another flap-mouthed 654 mourner, black and grim,</p>
<p>Against the welkin 655 volleys out his voice 656 .</p>
<p>Another and another answer him,</p>
<p>Clapping 657 their proud tails to the ground below,</p>
<p>Shaking their scratched ears, bleeding as they go.</p>
<p>Look, how the world’s poor people are amazed</p>
<p>At apparitions, signs and prodigies 658 ,</p>
<p>Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,</p>
<p>Infusing 659 them with dreadful 660 prophecies:</p>
<p>So she at these sad signs draws up 661 her breath</p>
<p>And, sighing it again, exclaims on 662 death.</p>
<p>’Hard-favoured 663 tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,</p>
<p>Hateful divorce 664 of love’ — thus chides she Death —</p>
<p>’Grim-grinning ghost, earth’s worm 665 , what dost thou mean</p>
<p>To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,</p>
<p>Who when he lived, his breath and beauty set</p>
<p>Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?</p>
<p>’If he be dead — O no, it cannot be,</p>
<p>Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it!</p>
<p>O yes, it may! Thou hast no eyes 666 to see,</p>
<p>But hatefully at random dost thou hit:</p>
<p>Thy mark 667 is feeble age, but thy false dart 668</p>
<p>Mistakes that aim and cleaves 669 an infant’s heart.</p>
<p>’Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had 670 spoke,</p>
<p>And, hearing him, thy power had lost his power —</p>
<p>The destinies will curse thee for this stroke —</p>
<p>They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck’st a flower:</p>
<p>Love’s golden arrow 671 at him should have fled 672 ,</p>
<p>And not death’s ebon 673 dart to strike him dead.</p>
<p>’Dost thou drink tears, that thou provok’st such weeping?</p>
<p>What may a heavy 674 groan advantage thee?</p>
<p>Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping</p>
<p>Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?</p>
<p>Now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour 675 ,</p>
<p>Since her best work is ruined with thy rigour 676 .’</p>
<p>Here overcome as one full of despair,</p>
<p>She vailed 677 her eyelids who 678 like sluices 679 stopped</p>
<p>The crystal tide 680 that from her two cheeks fair</p>
<p>In the sweet channel of her bosom dropped,</p>
<p>But through the floodgates breaks the silver rain</p>
<p>And with his strong course 681 opens them again.</p>
<p>O, how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow 682 :</p>
<p>Her eye seen in the tears, tears in her eye,</p>
<p>Both crystals 683 , where they viewed each other’s sorrow,</p>
<p>Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry,</p>
<p>But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,</p>
<p>Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.</p>
<p>Variable 684 passions 685 throng 686 her constant woe</p>
<p>As striving who should best become 687 her grief:</p>
<p>All entertained 688 , each passion labours so 689</p>
<p>That every present sorrow seemeth chief,</p>
<p>But none is best. Then join they all together</p>
<p>Like many clouds consulting for 690 foul weather.</p>
<p>By this 691 , far off she hears some huntsman hollo 692 .</p>
<p>A nurse’s song ne’er pleased her babe so well:</p>
<p>The dire imagination 693 she did follow</p>
<p>This sound of hope doth labour to expel,</p>
<p>For now reviving joy bids her rejoice</p>
<p>And flatters her it is Adonis’ voice.</p>
<p>Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,</p>
<p>Being prisoned in her eye like pearls in glass,</p>
<p>Yet sometimes falls an orient 694 drop beside,</p>
<p>Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass</p>
<p>To wash the foul 695 face of the sluttish 696 ground,</p>
<p>Who is but drunken when she seemeth drowned.</p>
<p>O hard-believing 697 love, how strange it seems</p>
<p>Not to believe and yet too credulous!</p>
<p>Thy weal 698 and woe are both of them extremes,</p>
<p>Despair and hope makes thee ridiculous:</p>
<p>The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,</p>
<p>In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.</p>
<p>Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought 699 :</p>
<p>Adonis lives and Death is not to blame.</p>
<p>It was not she that called him all to naught 700 ,</p>
<p>Now she adds honours to his hateful name:</p>
<p>She clepes 701 him king of graves and grave for kings,</p>
<p>Imperious supreme 702 of all mortal things.</p>
<p>‘No, no,’ quoth she, ’sweet Death, I did but jest,</p>
<p>Yet pardon me I felt a kind of fear</p>
<p>Whenas 703 I met the boar, that bloody beast,</p>
<p>Which knows no pity, but is still severe 704 :</p>
<p>Then, gentle shadow 705 — truth I must confess —</p>
<p>I railed on 706 thee, fearing my love’s decease.</p>
<p>’’Tis not my fault, the boar provoked my tongue:</p>
<p>Be wreaked 707 on him, invisible commander,</p>
<p>’Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong —</p>
<p>I did but act 708 , he’s author of thy slander.</p>
<p>Grief hath two tongues and never woman yet</p>
<p>Could rule them both without ten women’s wit.’</p>
<p>Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,</p>
<p>Her rash suspect 709 she doth extenuate 710 ,</p>
<p>And that his beauty may the better thrive,</p>
<p>With death she humbly doth insinuate 711 ,</p>
<p>Tells him of trophies 712 , statues, tombs and stories,</p>
<p>His victories, his triumphs and his glories.</p>
<p>‘O Jove 713 ,’ quoth she, ’how much a fool was I</p>
<p>To be of such a weak and silly mind</p>
<p>To wail his death who lives and must not die</p>
<p>Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind 714 !</p>
<p>For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,</p>
<p>And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.</p>
<p>’Fie, fie, fond 715 love, thou art as full of fear</p>
<p>As one with treasure laden, hemmed with 716 thieves:</p>
<p>Trifles, unwitnessèd with eye or ear,</p>
<p>Thy coward heart with false bethinking 717 grieves.’</p>
<p>Even at this word she hears a merry horn,</p>
<p>Whereat she leaps that was but late 718 forlorn.</p>
<p>As falcons to the lure 719 , away she flies,</p>
<p>The grass stoops not she treads on it so light,</p>
<p>And in her haste unfortunately 720 spies</p>
<p>The foul boar’s conquest on her fair delight,</p>
<p>Which seen, her eyes, are murdered with the view,</p>
<p>Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew,</p>
<p>Or as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,</p>
<p>Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain,</p>
<p>And there, all smothered up, in shade doth sit,</p>
<p>Long after fearing to creep forth again:</p>
<p>So at his bloody view her eyes are fled</p>
<p>Into the deep dark cabins 721 of her head,</p>
<p>Where they resign their office 722 and their light</p>
<p>To the disposing 723 of her troubled brain,</p>
<p>Who bids them still 724 consort with ugly night</p>
<p>And never wound the heart with looks again,</p>
<p>Who 725 , like a king perplexèd 726 in his throne,</p>
<p>By their suggestion 727 gives a deadly groan,</p>
<p>Whereat each tributary subject 728 quakes,</p>
<p>As when the wind, imprisoned in the ground 729 ,</p>
<p>Struggling for passage, earth’s foundation shakes,</p>
<p>Which with cold terror doth men’s minds confound 730 .</p>
<p>This mutiny each part doth so surprise 731</p>
<p>That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes,</p>
<p>And, being opened, threw unwilling light 732</p>
<p>Upon the wide wound that the boar had trenched 733</p>
<p>In his soft flank 734 , whose wonted 735 lily white</p>
<p>With purple 736 tears, that his wound wept, had drenched.</p>
<p>No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf or weed,</p>
<p>But stole 737 his blood and seemed with him to bleed.</p>
<p>This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth.</p>
<p>Over one shoulder doth she hang her head,</p>
<p>Dumbly she passions 738 , franticly she doteth 739 ,</p>
<p>She thinks he could not die, he is not dead:</p>
<p>Her voice is stopped, her joints forget to bow 740 ,</p>
<p>Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now 741 .</p>
<p>Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly</p>
<p>That her sight dazzling 742 makes the wound seem three,</p>
<p>And then she reprehends her mangling 743 eye</p>
<p>That makes more gashes where no breach should be:</p>
<p>His face seems twain, each several 744 limb is doubled,</p>
<p>For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.</p>
<p>’My tongue cannot express my grief for one,</p>
<p>And yet’, quoth she, ’behold two Adons dead!</p>
<p>My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,</p>
<p>Mine eyes are turned to fire, my heart to lead.</p>
<p>Heavy heart’s lead melt at mine eyes’ red fire!</p>
<p>So shall I die by drops of hot desire.</p>
<p>’Alas, poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!</p>
<p>What face remains alive that’s worth the viewing?</p>
<p>Whose tongue is music now? What canst thou boast</p>
<p>Of things long since, or any thing ensuing?</p>
<p>The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim 745 ,</p>
<p>But true sweet beauty lived and died with him.</p>
<p>’Bonnet 746 nor veil henceforth no creature wear!</p>
<p>Nor sun nor 747 wind will ever strive to kiss you,</p>
<p>Having no fair 748 to lose, you need not fear:</p>
<p>The sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you,</p>
<p>But when Adonis lived, sun and sharp air</p>
<p>Lurked like two thieves to rob him of his fair,</p>
<p>’And therefore would he put his bonnet on,</p>
<p>Under whose brim the gaudy 749 sun would peep.</p>
<p>The wind would blow it off and, being gone,</p>
<p>Play with his locks, then would Adonis weep,</p>
<p>And straight 750 , in pity of his tender years,</p>
<p>They both would strive who first should dry his tears.</p>
<p>’To see his face the lion walked along</p>
<p>Behind some hedge because he would not fear 751 him.</p>
<p>To recreate himself when he hath sung 752 ,</p>
<p>The tiger would be tame and gently hear him.</p>
<p>If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey</p>
<p>And never fright the silly 753 lamb that day.</p>
<p>’When he beheld his shadow 754 in the brook,</p>
<p>The fishes spread on it their golden gills,</p>
<p>When he was by 755 , the birds such pleasure took</p>
<p>That some would sing, some other in their bills</p>
<p>Would bring him mulberries and ripe red cherries:</p>
<p>He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.</p>
<p>’But this foul 756 , grim and urchin-snouted 757 boar,</p>
<p>Whose downward 758 eye still 759 looketh for a grave,</p>
<p>Ne’er saw the beauteous livery 760 that he wore:</p>
<p>Witness the entertainment that he gave.</p>
<p>If he did see his face, why then I know</p>
<p>He thought to kiss him and hath killed him so.</p>
<p>’’Tis true, ’tis true! Thus was Adonis slain:</p>
<p>He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,</p>
<p>Who did not whet 761 his teeth at him again 762</p>
<p>But by a kiss thought to persuade him there 763 ,</p>
<p>And, nuzzling 764 in his 765 flank, the loving swine</p>
<p>Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.</p>
<p>’Had I been toothed like him, I must confess,</p>
<p>With kissing him I should have killed him first,</p>
<p>But he is dead and never did he bless</p>
<p>My youth with his — the more am I accurst.’</p>
<p>With this, she falleth in the place she stood</p>
<p>And stains her face with his congealèd blood.</p>
<p>She looks upon his lips and they are pale,</p>
<p>She takes him by the hand and that is cold</p>
<p>She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,</p>
<p>As if they heard the woeful words she told.</p>
<p>She lifts the coffer-lids 766 767 that close his eyes,</p>
<p>Where, lo, two lamps burnt out in darkness lies:</p>
<p>Two glasses 768 , where herself herself beheld</p>
<p>A thousand times and now no more reflect,</p>
<p>Their virtue 769 lost wherein they late excelled,</p>
<p>And every beauty robbed of his 770 effect.</p>
<p>‘Wonder of time,’ quoth she, ’this is my spite,</p>
<p>That, thou being dead, the day should yet be light.</p>
<p>’Since thou art dead, lo, here I prophesy</p>
<p>Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend:</p>
<p>It shall be waited on with jealousy,</p>
<p>Find sweet beginning but unsavoury end,</p>
<p>Ne’er settled equally, but high or low 771 ,</p>
<p>That all love’s pleasure shall not match his woe.</p>
<p>’It shall be fickle, false and full of fraud,</p>
<p>Bud and be blasted 772 in a breathing while 773 ,</p>
<p>The bottom poison and the top o’erstrawed 774</p>
<p>With sweets 775 that shall the truest sight beguile 776 :</p>
<p>The strongest body shall it make most weak,</p>
<p>Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak.</p>
<p>’It shall be sparing 777 and too full of riot 778 ,</p>
<p>Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures 779 .</p>
<p>The staring 780 ruffian shall it keep in quiet,</p>
<p>Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures.</p>
<p>It shall be raging mad and silly 781 mild,</p>
<p>Make the young old, the old become a child.</p>
<p>’It shall suspect where is 782 no cause of fear,</p>
<p>It shall not fear where it should most mistrust,</p>
<p>It shall be merciful and too severe,</p>
<p>And most deceiving when it seems most just 783 ,</p>
<p>Perverse 784 it shall be where it shows most toward 785 ,</p>
<p>Put fear to 786 valour, courage to the coward.</p>
<p>’It shall be cause of war and dire events</p>
<p>And set dissension ’twixt the son and sire 787 ,</p>
<p>Subject and servile to all discontents 788 ,</p>
<p>As dry combustious 789 matter is to fire:</p>
<p>Sith 790 in his prime death doth my love destroy,</p>
<p>They that love best their loves shall not enjoy.’</p>
<p>By this, the boy that by her side lay killed</p>
<p>Was melted like a vapour from her sight,</p>
<p>And in his blood that on the ground lay spilled,</p>
<p>A purple 791 flower sprung up, chequered with white,</p>
<p>Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood</p>
<p>Which in round drops upon their whiteness tood.</p>
<p>She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,</p>
<p>Comparing it to her Adonis’ breath,</p>
<p>And says within her bosom it shall dwell,</p>
<p>Since he himself is reft 792 from her by death.</p>
<p>She crops the stalk and in the breach 793 appears</p>
<p>Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.</p>
<p>‘Poor flower,’ quoth she, ’this was thy father’s guise 794 ,</p>
<p>Sweet issue 795 of a more sweet-smelling sire,</p>
<p>For every little grief to wet his eyes.</p>
<p>To grow unto himself 796 was his desire,</p>
<p>And so ’tis thine: but know, it is as good</p>
<p>To wither in my breast as in his blood.</p>
<p>’Here was thy father’s bed, here in my breast,</p>
<p>Thou art the next of blood 797 , and ’tis thy right.</p>
<p>Lo, in this hollow cradle 798 take thy rest,</p>
<p>My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night.</p>
<p>There shall not be one minute in an hour</p>
<p>Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love’s flower.’</p>
<p>Thus weary of the world, away she hies 799</p>
<p>And yokes her silver doves, by whose swift aid</p>
<p>Their mistress, mounted, through the empty skies</p>
<p>In her light chariot quickly is conveyed,</p>
<p>Holding their course to Paphos 800 , where their queen</p>
<p>Means to immure 801 herself and not be seen.</p>

<h4 id="the-love">The love</h4>
<p>1 I dedicate to your lordship is without end: whereof this pamphlet 2
without beginning 3 is but a superfluous moiety 4 . The warrant 5 I have
of your honourable disposition, not the worth of my untutored lines,
makes it assured of acceptance. What I have done 6 is yours, what I have
to do 7 is yours, being 8 part in all I have, devoted yours. Were my
worth greater 9 , my duty would show greater: meantime, as it is, it is

all happiness.</p>
<p>Your lordship’s in all duty,</p>
<p>William Shakespeare</p>
<p>THE ARGUMENT 10</p>
<p>Lucius Tarquinius 11 (for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus 12 )
after he had caused his own father-in-law, Servius Tullius 13 , to be
cruelly murdered and, contrary to the Roman laws and customs, not
requiring or staying 14 for the people’s suffrages 15 , had possessed
himself of the kingdom, went, accompanied with his sons and other
noblemen of Rome, to besiege Ardea 16 . During which siege the principal
men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius,
the king’s son, in their discourses after supper every one commended the
virtues of his own wife: among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable
chastity of his wife Lucretia. In that pleasant humour 17 they posted 18
to Rome, and intending by their secret and sudden arrival to make trial
of 19 that which every one had before avouched 20 , only Collatinus
finds his wife, though it were late in the night, spinning amongst her
maids: the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling or in
several disports 21 , whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus the
victory and his wife the fame. At that time Sextus Tarquinius, being
inflamed with Lucrece’ beauty yet smothering his passions for the
present, departed with the rest back to the camp, from whence he shortly
after privily 22 withdrew himself and was, according to his estate 23 ,
royally entertained and lodged by Lucrece at Collatium 24 . The same
night he treacherously stealeth into her chamber, violently ravished 25
her and early in the morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable
plight, hastily dispatcheth messengers, one to Rome for her father,
another to the camp for Collatine. They came, the one accompanied with
Junius Brutus, the other with Publius Valerius, and, finding Lucrece
attired in mourning habit 26 , demanded the cause of her sorrow. She,
first taking an oath of them for her revenge, revealed the actor 27 and
whole manner of his dealing 28 and withal 29 suddenly stabbed herself.
Which done, with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated
family of the Tarquins, and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus
acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed with a
bitter invective against the tyranny of the king: wherewith 30 the
people were so moved that, with one consent and a general acclamation,
the Tarquins were all exiled and the state government changed from kings
to consuls.</p>
<p>From the besiegèd Ardea all in post 31 ,</p>
<p>Borne by the trustless 32 wings of false 33 desire,</p>
<p>Lust-breathèd 34 Tarquin leaves the Roman host 35</p>
<p>And to Collatium bears the lightless 36 fire</p>
<p>Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire 37</p>
<p>And girdle 38 with embracing flames the waist</p>
<p>Of Collatine’s fair love, Lucrece the chaste.</p>
<p>Haply 39 that name of ‘chaste’ unhapp’ly 40 set</p>
<p>This bateless 41 edge on his keen 42 appetite,</p>
<p>When Collatine unwisely did not let 43</p>
<p>To praise the clear unmatchèd red and white 44 ,</p>
<p>Which triumphed in that sky of his delight 45 ,</p>
<p>Where mortal stars 46 , as bright as heaven’s beauties,</p>
<p>With pure aspects 47 did him peculiar duties 48 .</p>
<p>For he the night before in Tarquin’s tent</p>
<p>Unlocked the treasure of his happy state:</p>
<p>What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent</p>
<p>In the possession of his beauteous mate,</p>
<p>Reck’ning his fortune at such high proud rate 49</p>
<p>That kings might be espousèd 50 to more fame,</p>
<p>But 51 king nor peer to such a peerless 52 dame.</p>
<p>O, happiness enjoyed but of 53 a few</p>
<p>And, if possessed, as soon decayed and done 54</p>
<p>As is the morning’s silver-melting dew</p>
<p>Against 55 the golden splendour of the sun,</p>
<p>An expired date, cancelled ere well begun 56 .</p>
<p>Honour and beauty in the owner’s arms</p>
<p>Are weakly fortressed 57 from a world of 58 harms.</p>
<p>Beauty itself doth of itself persuade</p>
<p>The eyes of men without an orator:</p>
<p>What needeth then apology 59 be made</p>
<p>To set forth that which is so singular 60 ?</p>
<p>Or why is Collatine the publisher 61</p>
<p>Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown</p>
<p>From thievish ears because it is his own?</p>
<p>Perchance 62 his boast of Lucrece’ sov’reignty 63</p>
<p>Suggested 64 this proud 65 issue 66 of a king,</p>
<p>For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be.</p>
<p>Perchance that envy of so rich a thing,</p>
<p>Braving compare 67 , disdainfully did sting</p>
<p>His high-pitched 68 thoughts that meaner 69 men should vaunt 70</p>
<p>That golden hap 71 which their superiors want 72 .</p>
<p>But some untimely 73 thought did instigate</p>
<p>His all-too-timeless 74 speed, if none of those:</p>
<p>His honour, his affairs, his friends, his state 75 ,</p>
<p>Neglected all, with swift intent 76 he goes</p>
<p>To quench the coal which in his liver 77 glows.</p>
<p>O rash false heat 78 , wrapped in repentant cold,</p>
<p>Thy hasty spring still blasts 79 and ne’er grows old!</p>
<p>When at Collatium this false lord arrived,</p>
<p>Well was he welcomed by the Roman dame,</p>
<p>Within whose face Beauty and Virtue strived</p>
<p>Which of them both should underprop 80 her fame.</p>
<p>When Virtue bragged, Beauty would blush for shame,</p>
<p>When Beauty boasted blushes, in despite 81</p>
<p>Virtue would stain that o’er with silver white.</p>
<p>But Beauty, in that white intitulèd 82 ,</p>
<p>From Venus’ doves 83 doth challenge that fair 84 field 85 .</p>
<p>Then Virtue claims from Beauty Beauty’s red 86 ,</p>
<p>Which Virtue gave the golden age 87 to gild 88</p>
<p>Their silver cheeks and called it then their shield 89 ,</p>
<p>Teaching them thus to use it in the fight:</p>
<p>When shame assailed 90 , the red should fence 91 the white.</p>
<p>This heraldry 92 in Lucrece’ face was seen,</p>
<p>Argued 93 by Beauty’s red and Virtue’s white:</p>
<p>Of either’s colour was the other queen,</p>
<p>Proving from world’s minority 94 their right.</p>
<p>Yet their ambition makes them still 95 to fight,</p>
<p>The sov’reignty of either being so great</p>
<p>That oft they interchange each other’s seat 96 .</p>
<p>This silent war of lilies and of roses,</p>
<p>Which Tarquin viewed in her fair face’s field,</p>
<p>In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses 97 ,</p>
<p>Where, lest between them both it should be killed,</p>
<p>The coward captive vanquishèd doth yield</p>
<p>To those two armies that would let him go</p>
<p>Rather than triumph in 98 so false a foe.</p>
<p>Now thinks he that her husband’s shallow tongue,</p>
<p>The niggard prodigal 99 that praised her so,</p>
<p>In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,</p>
<p>Which far exceeds his barren skill to show.</p>
<p>Therefore that praise, which Collatine doth owe 100 ,</p>
<p>Enchanted Tarquin answers 101 with surmise 102 ,</p>
<p>In silent wonder of still-gazing 103 eyes.</p>
<p>This earthly saint, adorèd by this devil,</p>
<p>Little suspecteth the false worshipper:</p>
<p>For unstained thoughts do seldom dream on evil.</p>
<p>Birds never limed 104 no secret 105 bushes fear:</p>
<p>So guiltless she securely 106 gives good cheer 107</p>
<p>And reverend 108 welcome to her princely guest,</p>
<p>Whose inward ill no outward harm expressed.</p>
<p>For that 109 he coloured 110 with his high estate,</p>
<p>Hiding base sin in pleats 111 of majesty,</p>
<p>That 112 nothing in him seemed inordinate 113 ,</p>
<p>Save sometime too much wonder of his eye,</p>
<p>Which, having all, all could not satisfy;</p>
<p>But, poorly rich, so wanteth in his store 114</p>
<p>That, cloyed with much, he pineth 115 still for more.</p>
<p>But she that never coped 116 with stranger 117 eyes</p>
<p>Could pick no meaning from their parling 118 looks,</p>
<p>Nor read the subtle shining secrecies 119</p>
<p>Writ in the glassy margents 120 of such books:</p>
<p>She touched no 121 unknown baits, nor feared no hooks,</p>
<p>Nor could she moralize 122 his wanton sight 123</p>
<p>More than his eyes were opened to the light 124 .</p>
<p>He stories 125 to her ears her husband’s fame,</p>
<p>Won in the fields of fruitful Italy,</p>
<p>And decks 126 with praises Collatine’s high name,</p>
<p>Made glorious by his manly chivalry</p>
<p>With bruisèd arms 127 and wreaths of victory.</p>
<p>Her joy with heaved-up 128 hand she doth express,</p>
<p>And wordless so greets 129 heaven for his success.</p>
<p>Far from the purpose of his coming thither,</p>
<p>He makes excuses for his being there.</p>
<p>No cloudy show of stormy blust’ring weather</p>
<p>Doth yet in his fair 130 welkin 131 once appear</p>
<p>Till sable 132 night, mother of dread and fear,</p>
<p>Upon the world dim darkness doth display</p>
<p>And in her vaulty 133 prison stows 134 the day.</p>
<p>For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed,</p>
<p>Intending 135 weariness with heavy sprite 136 ,</p>
<p>For after supper long he questionèd 137</p>
<p>With modest Lucrece and wore out 138 the night.</p>
<p>Now leaden slumber with life’s strength doth fight</p>
<p>And everyone to rest themselves betake 139 ,</p>
<p>Save thieves and cares 140 and troubled minds that wake.</p>
<p>As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving 141</p>
<p>The sundry 142 dangers of his will’s obtaining 143 ,</p>
<p>Yet ever to obtain his will resolving,</p>
<p>Though weak-built hopes 144 persuade him to abstaining:</p>
<p>Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining 145</p>
<p>And when great treasure 146 is the meed 147 proposed,</p>
<p>Though death be adjunct 148 , there’s no death supposed 149 .</p>
<p>Those that much covet are with gain so fond 150</p>
<p>That what they have not, that which they possess</p>
<p>They scatter and unloose it from their bond 151 ,</p>
<p>And so by hoping 152 more they have but less,</p>
<p>Or gaining more, the profit of excess</p>
<p>Is but to surfeit 153 , and such griefs sustain 154</p>
<p>That they prove bankrupt in this poor rich gain.</p>
<p>The aim of all is but to nurse the life</p>
<p>With honour, wealth and ease in waning age,</p>
<p>And in this aim there is such thwarting strife,</p>
<p>That one for all or all for one we gage 155 :</p>
<p>As 156 life for honour in fell 157 battle’s rage,</p>
<p>Honour for wealth and oft that wealth doth cost</p>
<p>The death of all and all together lost.</p>
<p>So that in vent’ring ill 158 , we leave 159 to be</p>
<p>The things we are for that which we expect 160 :</p>
<p>And this ambitious foul infirmity 161 ,</p>
<p>In having much, torments us with defect 162</p>
<p>Of that we have: so then we do neglect</p>
<p>The thing we have and, all for want of wit 163 ,</p>
<p>Make something nothing by augmenting 164 it.</p>
<p>Such hazard 165 now must doting 166 Tarquin make,</p>
<p>Pawning his honour to obtain his lust,</p>
<p>And for himself himself he must forsake 167 .</p>
<p>Then where is truth, if there be no self-trust?</p>
<p>When shall he think to find a stranger just,</p>
<p>When he himself himself confounds 168 , betrays</p>
<p>To sland’rous tongues and wretched hateful days?</p>
<p>Now stole upon the time the dead of night,</p>
<p>When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes.</p>
<p>No comfortable 169 star did lend his light,</p>
<p>No noise but owls’ and wolves’ death-boding cries 170 .</p>
<p>Now serves the season 171 that they may surprise 172</p>
<p>The silly 173 lambs: pure thoughts are dead and still,</p>
<p>While lust and murder wakes to stain and kill.</p>
<p>And now this lustful lord leapt from his bed,</p>
<p>Throwing his mantle 174 rudely 175 o’er his arm,</p>
<p>Is madly tossed between desire and dread:</p>
<p>Th’one sweetly flatters, th’other feareth harm,</p>
<p>But honest fear, bewitched with lust’s foul charm,</p>
<p>Doth too too oft betake him to retire 176 ,</p>
<p>Beaten away by brainsick rude 177 desire.</p>
<p>His falchion 178 on a flint he softly smiteth 179 ,</p>
<p>That from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly,</p>
<p>Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth,</p>
<p>Which must be lodestar 180 to his lustful eye,</p>
<p>And to the flame thus speaks advisedly 181 ,</p>
<p>’As from this cold flint I enforced this fire,</p>
<p>So Lucrece must I force to my desire.’</p>
<p>Here pale with fear he doth premeditate 182</p>
<p>The dangers of his loathsome enterprise,</p>
<p>And in his inward mind he doth debate</p>
<p>What following sorrow may on this arise.</p>
<p>Then looking scornfully, he doth despise</p>
<p>His naked armour of still-slaughtered lust 183</p>
<p>And justly 184 thus controls his thoughts unjust:</p>
<p>’Fair torch, burn out thy light and lend it not</p>
<p>To darken her whose light excelleth thine,</p>
<p>And die, unhallowed 185 thoughts, before you blot</p>
<p>With your uncleanness that which is divine.</p>
<p>Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine.</p>
<p>Let fair humanity abhor the deed</p>
<p>That spots and stains love’s modest snow-white weed 186 .</p>
<p>’O shame to knighthood and to shining arms!</p>
<p>O foul dishonour to my household’s grave 187 !</p>
<p>O impious act, including all foul harms!</p>
<p>A martial man to be soft 188 fancy’s 189 slave!</p>
<p>True valour still 190 a true respect should have,</p>
<p>Then my digression 191 is so vile, so base,</p>
<p>That it will live engraven in my face.</p>
<p>’Yea, though I die, the scandal will survive</p>
<p>And be an eyesore in my golden coat 192 :</p>
<p>Some loathsome dash 193 the herald will contrive</p>
<p>To cipher me 194 how fondly 195 I did dote 196 ,</p>
<p>That my posterity, shamed with the note 197 ,</p>
<p>Shall curse my bones and hold it for 198 no sin</p>
<p>To wish that I their father had not been.</p>
<p>’What win I, if I gain the thing I seek?</p>
<p>A dream, a breath, a froth 199 of fleeting joy.</p>
<p>Who buys a minute’s mirth to wail a week?</p>
<p>Or sells eternity to get a toy 200 ?</p>
<p>For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?</p>
<p>Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,</p>
<p>Would with the sceptre straight 201 be strucken down?</p>
<p>’If Collatinus dream of my intent,</p>
<p>Will he not wake and in a desp’rate rage</p>
<p>Post 202 hither, this vile purpose to prevent?</p>
<p>This siege that hath engirt 203 his marriage,</p>
<p>This blur 204 to youth, this sorrow to the sage,</p>
<p>This dying virtue, this surviving shame,</p>
<p>Whose crime will bear an ever-during 205 blame?</p>
<p>’O, what excuse can my invention 206 make,</p>
<p>When thou shalt charge me with so black a deed?</p>
<p>Will not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake,</p>
<p>Mine eyes forgo their light 207 , my false heart bleed?</p>
<p>The guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed 208 ,</p>
<p>And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly 209 ,</p>
<p>But coward-like with trembling terror die.</p>
<p>’Had Collatinus killed my son or sire 210 ,</p>
<p>Or lain in ambush to betray my life,</p>
<p>Or were he not my dear friend, this desire</p>
<p>Might have excuse to work upon 211 his wife,</p>
<p>As in revenge or quittal 212 of such strife.</p>
<p>But as he is my kinsman, my dear friend,</p>
<p>The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end.</p>
<p>’Shameful it is: ay, if the fact 213 be known,</p>
<p>Hateful it is: there is no hate in loving.</p>
<p>I’ll beg her love, but she is not her own 214 :</p>
<p>The worst is but denial and reproving.</p>
<p>My will 215 is strong, past reason’s weak removing 216 :</p>
<p>Who 217 fears a sentence 218 or an old man’s saw 219</p>
<p>Shall by a painted cloth 220 be kept in awe.’</p>
<p>Thus, graceless 221 , holds he disputation 222</p>
<p>’Tween frozen conscience and hot burning will,</p>
<p>And with good thoughts make dispensation 223 ,</p>
<p>Urging the worser sense for vantage still 224 ,</p>
<p>Which in a moment doth confound 225 and kill</p>
<p>All pure effects 226 , and doth so far proceed</p>
<p>That what is vile shows like a virtuous deed.</p>
<p>Quoth 227 he, ’She took me kindly by the hand</p>
<p>And gazed for tidings in my eager eyes,</p>
<p>Fearing some hard 228 news from the warlike band,</p>
<p>Where her belovèd Collatinus lies.</p>
<p>O, how her fear did make her colour rise!</p>
<p>First red as roses that on lawn 229 we lay,</p>
<p>Then white as lawn, the roses took 230 away.</p>
<p>’And how her hand, in my hand being locked,</p>
<p>Forced it 231 to tremble with her loyal fear!</p>
<p>Which 232 struck her sad and then it 233 faster rocked,</p>
<p>Until her husband’s welfare she did hear,</p>
<p>Whereat she smilèd with so sweet a cheer</p>
<p>That, had Narcissus 234 seen her as she stood,</p>
<p>Self-love had never drowned him in the flood.</p>
<p>’Why hunt I then for colour 235 or excuses?</p>
<p>All orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth,</p>
<p>Poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses 236 ,</p>
<p>Love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth:</p>
<p>Affection 237 is my captain and he leadeth,</p>
<p>And when his gaudy 238 banner is displayed,</p>
<p>The coward 239 fights and will not be dismayed 240 .</p>
<p>’Then, childish fear, avaunt 241 ! Debating, die! 242</p>
<p>Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!</p>
<p>My heart shall never countermand 243 mine eye;</p>
<p>Sad 244 pause and deep regard beseems 245 the sage:</p>
<p>My part is youth and beats these from the stage.</p>
<p>Desire my pilot is, beauty my prize:</p>
<p>Then who fears sinking 246 where such treasure lies?’</p>
<p>As corn o’ergrown by weeds, so heedful 247 fear</p>
<p>Is almost choked by unresisted 248 lust:</p>
<p>Away he steals with open list’ning ear,</p>
<p>Full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust 249 ,</p>
<p>Both which, as servitors 250 to the unjust,</p>
<p>So cross 251 him with their opposite persuasion 252</p>
<p>That now he vows a league 253 and now invasion.</p>
<p>Within his thought her heavenly image sits,</p>
<p>And in the selfsame seat sits Collatine.</p>
<p>That eye which looks on her confounds his wits 254 ,</p>
<p>That eye which him beholds, as more divine 255 ,</p>
<p>Unto a view 256 so false will not incline 257 ,</p>
<p>But with a pure appeal seeks 258 to the heart,</p>
<p>Which once corrupted takes the worser part,</p>
<p>And therein heartens up 259 his servile powers 260 261 ,</p>
<p>Who, flattered by their leader’s jocund 262 show,</p>
<p>Stuff up 263 his lust, as minutes fill up hours,</p>
<p>And as their captain, so their pride 264 doth grow,</p>
<p>Paying more slavish tribute than they owe.</p>
<p>By reprobate 265 desire thus madly led,</p>
<p>The Roman lord marcheth to Lucrece’ bed.</p>
<p>The locks between her chamber 266 and his will 267 ,</p>
<p>Each one by him enforced, retires his ward 268 ,</p>
<p>But as they open they all rate his ill 269 ,</p>
<p>Which drives the creeping thief to some regard 270 :</p>
<p>The threshold grates the door to have him heard 271 ,</p>
<p>Night-wand’ring weasels 272 shriek to see him there,</p>
<p>They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear.</p>
<p>As each unwilling portal 273 yields him way,</p>
<p>Through little vents and crannies of the place,</p>
<p>The wind wars with his torch to make him stay 274</p>
<p>And blows the smoke of it into his face,</p>
<p>Extinguishing his conduct 275 in this case 276 .</p>
<p>But his hot heart, which fond desire doth scorch,</p>
<p>Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch,</p>
<p>And, being lighted, by the light he spies</p>
<p>Lucretia’s glove, wherein her needle 277 sticks.</p>
<p>He takes it from the rushes 278 where it lies,</p>
<p>And gripping it, the needle his finger pricks,</p>
<p>As who should 279 say, ’This glove to wanton tricks 280</p>
<p>Is not inured 281 . Return again in haste,</p>
<p>Thou see’st our mistress’ ornaments 282 are chaste.’</p>
<p>But all these poor forbiddings could not stay him.</p>
<p>He in the worst sense consters 283 their denial 284 :</p>
<p>The doors, the wind, the glove that did delay him,</p>
<p>He takes for accidental things of trial 285 ,</p>
<p>Or as those bars 286 which stop the hourly dial,</p>
<p>Who with a ling’ring stay his course doth let 287</p>
<p>Till every minute pays the hour his debt.</p>
<p>‘So, so,’ quoth he, ’these lets attend 288 the time,</p>
<p>Like little frosts that sometime threat 289 the spring</p>
<p>To add a more 290 rejoicing to the prime 291</p>
<p>And give the sneapèd 292 birds more cause to sing.</p>
<p>Pain pays the income 293 of each precious thing:</p>
<p>Huge rocks, high winds, strong pirates, shelves 294 and sands,</p>
<p>The merchant fears, ere rich at home he lands.’</p>
<p>Now is he come unto the chamber door</p>
<p>That shuts him from the heaven 295 of his thought 296 ,</p>
<p>Which with a yielding latch and with no more</p>
<p>Hath barred him from the blessèd thing 297 he sought.</p>
<p>So from 298 himself impiety hath wrought 299</p>
<p>That for his prey to pray he doth begin,</p>
<p>As if the heavens should countenance his sin.</p>
<p>But in the midst of his unfruitful prayer,</p>
<p>Having solicited th’eternal power</p>
<p>That his foul 300 thoughts might compass 301 his fair fair,</p>
<p>And they 302 would stand auspicious 303 to the hour,</p>
<p>Even there he starts 304 . Quoth he, ’I must deflow’r.</p>
<p>The powers to whom I pray abhor this fact:</p>
<p>How can they then assist me in the act 305 ?</p>
<p>’Then Love and Fortune be my gods, my guide.</p>
<p>My will is backed with resolution:</p>
<p>Thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried,</p>
<p>The blackest sin is cleared 306 with absolution 307 ,</p>
<p>Against love’s fire fear’s frost hath dissolution 308 .</p>
<p>The eye of heaven 309 is out 310 , and misty night</p>
<p>Covers the shame that follows sweet delight.’</p>
<p>This said, his guilty hand plucked up the latch,</p>
<p>And with his knee the door he opens wide 311 .</p>
<p>The dove sleeps fast 312 that this night owl will catch.</p>
<p>Thus treason works 313 ere traitors be espied.</p>
<p>Who 314 sees the lurking serpent steps aside,</p>
<p>But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,</p>
<p>Lies at the mercy of his mortal 315 sting 316 .</p>
<p>Into the chamber wickedly he stalks 317</p>
<p>And gazeth on her yet unstainèd bed:</p>
<p>The curtains 318 being close 319 , about he walks,</p>
<p>Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head.</p>
<p>By their high treason 320 is his heart misled,</p>
<p>Which gives the watchword 321 to his hand full 322 soon</p>
<p>To draw the cloud 323 that hides the silver moon 324 .</p>
<p>Look as 325 the fair and fiery-pointed sun,</p>
<p>Rushing from forth a cloud, bereaves 326 our sight,</p>
<p>Even so, the curtain drawn, his eyes begun</p>
<p>To wink 327 , being blinded with a greater light.</p>
<p>Whether it is that she reflects so bright 328</p>
<p>That dazzleth them, or else some shame supposed,</p>
<p>But blind they are and keep themselves enclosed 329 .</p>
<p>O, had they in that darksome prison 330 died</p>
<p>Then had they seen the period 331 of their ill:</p>
<p>Then Collatine again, by Lucrece’ side,</p>
<p>In his clear 332 bed might have reposèd still.</p>
<p>But they must ope 333 this blessèd league 334 to kill,</p>
<p>And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight</p>
<p>Must sell her joy, her life, her world’s delight.</p>
<p>Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,</p>
<p>Coz’ning 335 the pillow of a lawful kiss,</p>
<p>Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder 336 ,</p>
<p>Swelling 337 on either side to want his 338 bliss,</p>
<p>Between whose hills her head entombèd is,</p>
<p>Where like a virtuous monument 339 she lies,</p>
<p>To be admired of 340 lewd 341 unhallowed 342 eyes.</p>
<p>Without 343 the bed her other fair hand was</p>
<p>On the green coverlet, whose perfect white</p>
<p>Showed like an April daisy on the grass</p>
<p>With pearly sweat resembling dew of night.</p>
<p>Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light 344</p>
<p>And, canopied in darkness, sweetly lay</p>
<p>Till they might open to adorn the day.</p>
<p>Her hair like golden threads played with her breath —</p>
<p>O modest wantons, wanton modesty! —</p>
<p>Showing life’s triumph in the map 345 of death</p>
<p>And death’s dim look in life’s mortality 346 .</p>
<p>Each 347 in her sleep themselves so beautify,</p>
<p>As if between them twain 348 there were no strife,</p>
<p>But that life lived in death and death in life.</p>
<p>Her breasts, like ivory globes circled with blue,</p>
<p>A pair of maiden 349 worlds unconquerèd,</p>
<p>Save of their lord no bearing yoke 350 they knew,</p>
<p>And him by oath they truly honourèd.</p>
<p>These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred,</p>
<p>Who like a foul usurper went about</p>
<p>From this fair throne to heave the owner out.</p>
<p>What could he see but mightily he noted?</p>
<p>What did he note but strongly he desired?</p>
<p>What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,</p>
<p>And in his will 351 his wilful eye he tired 352 .</p>
<p>With more than admiration he admired</p>
<p>Her azure 353 veins, her alabaster 354 skin,</p>
<p>Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.</p>
<p>As the grim 355 lion fawneth o’er his prey,</p>
<p>Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,</p>
<p>So o’er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay 356 ,</p>
<p>His rage of lust by gazing qualified 357 ,</p>
<p>Slaked 358 , not suppressed, for standing by her side,</p>
<p>His eye, which late 359 this mutiny restrains,</p>
<p>Unto a greater uproar 360 tempts his veins.</p>
<p>And they, like straggling slaves 361 for pillage 362 fighting,</p>
<p>Obdurate 363 vassals 364 fell 365 exploits effecting 366 ,</p>
<p>In bloody death and ravishment 367 delighting,</p>
<p>Nor children’s tears nor 368 mothers’ groans respecting 369 ,</p>
<p>Swell in their pride 370 , the onset 371 still expecting.</p>
<p>Anon 372 his beating heart, alarum 373 striking,</p>
<p>Gives the hot charge 374 and bids them do their liking 375 .</p>
<p>His drumming heart cheers up 376 his burning eye,</p>
<p>His eye commends 377 the leading to his hand,</p>
<p>His hand, as proud of such a dignity,</p>
<p>Smoking with pride, marched on to make his stand 378</p>
<p>On her bare breast, the heart of all her land,</p>
<p>Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale 379 ,</p>
<p>Left their round turrets destitute and pale.</p>
<p>They, must’ring 380 to the quiet cabinet 381</p>
<p>Where their dear governess and lady lies,</p>
<p>Do tell her she is dreadfully beset 382</p>
<p>And fright her with confusion of their cries.</p>
<p>She, much amazed, breaks ope her locked-up eyes,</p>
<p>Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,</p>
<p>Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled.</p>
<p>Imagine her as one in dead of night</p>
<p>From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,</p>
<p>That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly 383 sprite 384 ,</p>
<p>Whose grim aspect 385 sets every joint a-shaking —</p>
<p>What terror ’tis! But she, in worser taking 386 ,</p>
<p>From sleep disturbèd, heedfully 387 doth view</p>
<p>The sight which makes supposèd 388 terror true.</p>
<p>Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears,</p>
<p>Like to a new-killed bird she trembling lies:</p>
<p>She dares not look, yet winking 389 there appears</p>
<p>Quick-shifting 390 antics 391 , ugly in her eyes:</p>
<p>Such shadows 392 are the weak brain’s forgeries 393 ,</p>
<p>Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,</p>
<p>In darkness daunts 394 them with more dreadful sights.</p>
<p>His hand that yet remains upon her breast —</p>
<p>Rude ram 395 to batter such an ivory wall —</p>
<p>May feel her heart (poor citizen 396 ) distressed,</p>
<p>Wounding itself to death 397 , rise up and fall,</p>
<p>Beating her bulk 398 that 399 his hand shakes withal 400 .</p>
<p>This moves in him more rage and lesser pity</p>
<p>To make the breach 401 and enter this sweet city.</p>
<p>First like a trumpet doth his tongue begin</p>
<p>To sound a parley 402 to his heartless 403 foe,</p>
<p>Who o’er the white sheet peers her whiter chin,</p>
<p>The reason of this rash alarm 404 to know,</p>
<p>Which he by dumb demeanour 405 seeks to show.</p>
<p>But she with vehement prayers urgeth 406 still</p>
<p>Under what colour 407 he commits this ill.</p>
<p>Thus he replies, ’The colour in thy face,</p>
<p>That even for anger makes the lily pale</p>
<p>And the red rose blush at her own disgrace,</p>
<p>Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale 408 .</p>
<p>Under that colour am I come to scale</p>
<p>Thy never-conquered fort: the fault is thine,</p>
<p>For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine.</p>
<p>’Thus I forestall thee, if thou mean to chide 409 :</p>
<p>Thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night,</p>
<p>Where thou with patience must my will 410 abide 411 ,</p>
<p>My will that marks thee for my earth’s delight,</p>
<p>Which 412 I to conquer sought with all my might,</p>
<p>But as reproof and reason beat it dead,</p>
<p>By thy bright beauty was it newly bred 413 .</p>
<p>’I see what crosses 414 my attempt will bring,</p>
<p>I know what thorns the growing rose defends,</p>
<p>I think the honey 415 guarded with a sting:</p>
<p>All this beforehand counsel 416 comprehends.</p>
<p>But will is deaf and hears no heedful friends,</p>
<p>Only he hath 417 an eye to gaze on beauty,</p>
<p>And dotes on what he looks, gainst law or duty.</p>
<p>’I have debated, even in my soul,</p>
<p>What wrong, what shame, what sorrow I shall breed</p>
<p>But nothing can affection’s course control</p>
<p>Or stop the headlong fury of his speed.</p>
<p>I know repentant tears ensue 418 the deed,</p>
<p>Reproach, disdain and deadly enmity,</p>
<p>Yet strive I to embrace mine infamy 419 .’</p>
<p>This said, he shakes 420 aloft his Roman blade 421 ,</p>
<p>Which, like a falcon 422 tow’ring in the skies,</p>
<p>Coucheth 423 the fowl below with his wings’ shade,</p>
<p>Whose 424 crooked beak threats if he mount 425 he dies.</p>
<p>So under his insulting 426 falchion 427 lies</p>
<p>Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells</p>
<p>With trembling fear, as fowl hear falcons’ bells 428 .</p>
<p>‘Lucrece,’ quoth he, ’this night I must enjoy thee.</p>
<p>If thou deny 429 , then force must work my way,</p>
<p>For in thy bed I purpose to destroy 430 thee.</p>
<p>That done, some worthless slave of thine I’ll slay,</p>
<p>To kill thine honour with thy life’s decay,</p>
<p>And in thy dead arms do I mean to place him,</p>
<p>Swearing I slew him seeing thee embrace him.</p>
<p>’So thy surviving husband shall remain</p>
<p>The scornful mark 431 of every open eye,</p>
<p>Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain,</p>
<p>Thy issue blurred 432 with nameless 433 bastardy;</p>
<p>And thou, the author of their obloquy 434 ,</p>
<p>Shalt have thy trespass 435 cited up in rhymes</p>
<p>And sung by children in succeeding times.</p>
<p>’But if thou yield, I rest 436 thy secret friend 437 :</p>
<p>The fault unknown is as a thought unacted,</p>
<p>A little harm done to a great good end</p>
<p>For lawful policy remains enacted 438 .</p>
<p>The poisonous simple 439 sometime is compacted 440</p>
<p>In a pure compound, being so applied</p>
<p>His venom in effect is purified.</p>
<p>’Then, for thy husband and thy children’s sake,</p>
<p>Tender my suit 441 , bequeath not to their lot</p>
<p>The shame that from them no device 442 can take,</p>
<p>The blemish that will never be forgot,</p>
<p>Worse than a slavish wipe 443 or birth-hour’s blot 444 :</p>
<p>For marks descried 445 in men’s nativity</p>
<p>Are nature’s faults, not their own infamy.’</p>
<p>Here with a cockatrice 446 ’ dead-killing eye</p>
<p>He rouseth up himself 447 and makes a pause,</p>
<p>While she, the picture of pure piety,</p>
<p>Like a white hind 448 under the gripe 449 ’s sharp claws,</p>
<p>Pleads 450 in a wilderness where are no laws</p>
<p>To the rough beast that knows no gentle 451 right</p>
<p>Nor aught 452 obeys but his foul appetite.</p>
<p>But when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,</p>
<p>In his dim mist th’aspiring mountains hiding,</p>
<p>From earth’s dark womb some gentle gust doth get 453 ,</p>
<p>Which blows these pitchy 454 vapours from their biding 455 ,</p>
<p>Hind’ring their present fall 456 by this dividing,</p>
<p>So his unhallowed 457 haste her words delays,</p>
<p>And moody Pluto 458 winks 459 while Orpheus plays.</p>
<p>Yet, foul night-waking cat, he doth but dally 460 ,</p>
<p>While in his holdfast 461 foot the weak mouse panteth.</p>
<p>Her sad behaviour feeds his vulture folly 462 ,</p>
<p>A swallowing gulf 463 that even in plenty wanteth.</p>
<p>His ear her prayers admits 464 , but his heart granteth</p>
<p>No penetrable 465 entrance to her plaining 466 :</p>
<p>Tears harden 467 lust, though marble wear with raining.</p>
<p>Her pity-pleading eyes are sadly fixed</p>
<p>In the remorseless wrinkles of his face.</p>
<p>Her modest eloquence with sighs is mixed,</p>
<p>Which to her oratory adds more grace.</p>
<p>She puts the period 468 often from his place 469 ,</p>
<p>And midst the sentence so her accent 470 breaks</p>
<p>That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks.</p>
<p>She conjures him by 471 high almighty Jove 472 ,</p>
<p>By knighthood, gentry 473 and sweet friendship’s oath,</p>
<p>By her untimely 474 tears, her husband’s love,</p>
<p>By holy human law and common troth 475 ,</p>
<p>By heaven and earth and all the power of both,</p>
<p>That to his borrowed 476 bed he make retire 477</p>
<p>And stoop 478 to honour, not to foul desire.</p>
<p>Quoth she, ’Reward not hospitality</p>
<p>With such black payment as thou hast pretended 479 ,</p>
<p>Mud 480 not the fountain that gave drink to thee,</p>
<p>Mar 481 not the thing 482 that cannot be amended,</p>
<p>End thy ill aim 483 before thy shoot 484 be ended 485 .</p>
<p>He is no woodman 486 that doth bend his bow</p>
<p>To strike 487 a poor unseasonable 488 doe.</p>
<p>’My husband is thy friend, for his sake spare me.</p>
<p>Thyself art mighty, for thine own sake leave me:</p>
<p>Myself a weakling, do not then ensnare me.</p>
<p>Thou look’st not like deceit, do not deceive me.</p>
<p>My sighs, like whirlwinds, labour hence to heave 489 thee.</p>
<p>If ever man were moved 490 with woman’s moans,</p>
<p>Be movèd with my tears, my sighs, my groans,</p>
<p>’All which together, like a troubled ocean,</p>
<p>Beat at thy rocky and wrack-threat’ning 491 heart,</p>
<p>To soften it with their continual motion,</p>
<p>For stones dissolved to water do convert.</p>
<p>O, if no harder than a stone thou art,</p>
<p>Melt at my tears and be compassionate:</p>
<p>Soft pity enters at an iron gate.</p>
<p>’In Tarquin’s likeness I did entertain thee:</p>
<p>Hast thou put on his shape 492 to do him shame?</p>
<p>To all the host of heaven I complain me.</p>
<p>Thou wrong’st his honour, wound’st his princely name:</p>
<p>Thou art not what thou seem’st, and if the same,</p>
<p>Thou seem’st not what thou art, a god, a king,</p>
<p>For kings like gods should govern everything 493 .</p>
<p>’How will thy shame be seeded 494 in thine age</p>
<p>When thus thy vices bud before thy spring?</p>
<p>If in thy hope 495 thou dar’st do such outrage 496 ,</p>
<p>What dar’st thou not when once thou art a king?</p>
<p>O, be remembered, no outrageous thing</p>
<p>From vassal actors 497 can be wiped away,</p>
<p>Then kings’ misdeeds cannot be hid in clay 498 .</p>
<p>’This deed will make thee only loved for 499 fear,</p>
<p>But happy 500 monarchs still 501 are feared 502 for love.</p>
<p>With foul offenders thou perforce must bear,</p>
<p>When they in thee the like offences prove 503 .</p>
<p>If but for fear of this, thy will remove 504 .</p>
<p>For princes are the glass 505 , the school, the book,</p>
<p>Where subjects’ eyes do learn, do read, do look.</p>
<p>’And wilt thou be the school where lust shall learn?</p>
<p>Must he in thee read lectures 506 of such shame?</p>
<p>Wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern</p>
<p>Authority for sin, warrant 507 for blame,</p>
<p>To privilege 508 dishonour in thy name?</p>
<p>Thou back’st 509 reproach against long-living laud 510</p>
<p>And mak’st fair reputation but a bawd 511 .</p>
<p>’Hast thou command 512 ? By him that gave it thee,</p>
<p>From a pure heart command thy rebel will:</p>
<p>Draw not thy sword to guard iniquity 513 ,</p>
<p>For it was lent thee all that brood 514 to kill.</p>
<p>Thy princely office 515 how canst thou fulfil,</p>
<p>When, patterned by 516 thy fault, foul sin may say,</p>
<p>He learned to sin and thou didst teach the way?</p>
<p>’Think but how vile a spectacle it were</p>
<p>To view thy present trespass in another.</p>
<p>Men’s faults do seldom to themselves appear:</p>
<p>Their own transgressions partially they smother.</p>
<p>This guilt would seem death-worthy in thy brother.</p>
<p>O, how are they wrapped in with infamies 517</p>
<p>That from their own misdeeds askance 518 their eyes!</p>
<p>’To thee, to thee, my heaved-up 519 hands appeal,</p>
<p>Not to seducing lust, thy rash relier 520 .</p>
<p>I sue for exiled majesty’s repeal 521 :</p>
<p>Let him return and flatt’ring 522 thoughts retire.</p>
<p>His true respect 523 will prison false desire</p>
<p>And wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne 524 ,</p>
<p>That thou shalt see thy state 525 and pity mine.’</p>
<p>‘Have done’, quoth he. ’My uncontrollèd tide</p>
<p>Turns not, but swells 526 the higher by this let 527 .</p>
<p>Small lights are soon blown out, huge fires abide</p>
<p>And with the wind in greater fury fret:</p>
<p>The petty streams that pay a daily debt</p>
<p>To their salt sovereign 528 with their fresh falls’ haste</p>
<p>Add to his flow, but alter not his taste.’</p>
<p>‘Thou art’, quoth she, ’a sea, a sovereign king,</p>
<p>And, lo, there falls into thy boundless flood</p>
<p>Black lust, dishonour, shame, misgoverning,</p>
<p>Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood 529 .</p>
<p>If all these petty ills shall change thy good,</p>
<p>Thy sea within a puddle’s womb is hearsed 530 ,</p>
<p>And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed.</p>
<p>’So shall these slaves 531 be king and thou their slave,</p>
<p>Thou nobly base, they basely dignified,</p>
<p>Thou their fair life and they thy fouler grave,</p>
<p>Thou loathèd in their shame, they in thy pride.</p>
<p>The lesser thing should not the greater hide.</p>
<p>The cedar stoops not to the base shrub’s foot,</p>
<p>But low shrubs wither at the cedar’s root.</p>
<p>‘So let thy thoughts, low vassals 532 to thy state —’</p>
<p>‘No more’, quoth he, ’by heaven, I will not hear thee.</p>
<p>Yield to my love. If not, enforcèd hate</p>
<p>Instead of love’s coy 533 touch shall rudely tear thee.</p>
<p>That done, despitefully 534 I mean to bear thee</p>
<p>Unto the base bed of some rascal groom 535</p>
<p>To be thy partner in this shameful doom 536 .’</p>
<p>This said, he sets his foot upon the light,</p>
<p>For light and lust are deadly enemies:</p>
<p>Shame folded up in blind concealing night,</p>
<p>When most unseen, then most doth tyrannize.</p>
<p>The wolf hath seized 537 his prey, the poor lamb cries,</p>
<p>Till with her own white fleece 538 her voice controlled 539</p>
<p>Entombs her outcry in her lips’ sweet fold 540 .</p>
<p>For with the nightly linen 541 that she wears</p>
<p>He pens her piteous clamours in her head,</p>
<p>Cooling his hot face in the chastest tears</p>
<p>That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed.</p>
<p>O, that prone 542 lust should stain so pure a bed,</p>
<p>The spots whereof could weeping 543 purify,</p>
<p>Her tears should drop on them perpetually!</p>
<p>But she hath lost a dearer thing than life</p>
<p>And he hath won what he would lose again:</p>
<p>This forcèd league 544 doth force a further strife,</p>
<p>This momentary joy breeds months of pain,</p>
<p>This hot desire converts to cold disdain,</p>
<p>Pure chastity is rifled 545 of her store,</p>
<p>And lust, the thief, far poorer than before.</p>
<p>Look as the full-fed hound or gorgèd 546 hawk,</p>
<p>Unapt 547 for tender smell or speedy flight,</p>
<p>Make slow pursuit, or altogether balk 548</p>
<p>The prey wherein by nature they delight:</p>
<p>So surfeit-taking 549 Tarquin fares this night:</p>
<p>His taste delicious, in digestion souring,</p>
<p>Devours his will that lived by foul devouring.</p>
<p>O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit 550</p>
<p>Can comprehend in still imagination 551 !</p>
<p>Drunken desire must vomit his receipt 552 ,</p>
<p>Ere he can see his own abomination.</p>
<p>While lust is in his pride 553 , no exclamation 554</p>
<p>Can curb his heat or rein his rash desire,</p>
<p>Till like a jade 555 self-will himself doth tire.</p>
<p>And then with lank and lean discoloured cheek,</p>
<p>With heavy eye, knit brow and strengthless pace,</p>
<p>Feeble desire, all recreant 556 , poor and meek,</p>
<p>Like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case:</p>
<p>The flesh being proud 557 , desire doth fight with grace,</p>
<p>For there 558 it revels 559 and when that decays 560 ,</p>
<p>The guilty rebel for remission 561 prays.</p>
<p>So fares it with this faultful lord of Rome,</p>
<p>Who this accomplishment so hotly chased,</p>
<p>For now against himself he sounds this doom 562 ,</p>
<p>That through the length of times he stands disgraced.</p>
<p>Besides, his soul’s fair temple is defaced,</p>
<p>To whose weak ruins muster troops of cares,</p>
<p>To ask the spotted princess 563 how she fares.</p>
<p>She says her subjects 564 with foul insurrection</p>
<p>Have battered down her consecrated wall,</p>
<p>And by their mortal 565 fault brought in subjection</p>
<p>Her immortality and made her thrall 566</p>
<p>To living death and pain perpetual,</p>
<p>Which in her prescience 567 she controllèd still 568 ,</p>
<p>But 569 her foresight could not forestall their will.</p>
<p>Ev’n in this thought through the dark night he stealeth,</p>
<p>A captive victor that hath lost in gain,</p>
<p>Bearing away the wound that nothing healeth,</p>
<p>The scar that will, despite of cure, remain,</p>
<p>Leaving his spoil 570 perplexed 571 in greater pain.</p>
<p>She bears the load of lust 572 he left behind,</p>
<p>And he the burden of a guilty mind.</p>
<p>He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence,</p>
<p>She like a wearied lamb lies panting there.</p>
<p>He scowls and hates himself for his offence,</p>
<p>She, desperate 573 , with her nails her flesh doth tear.</p>
<p>He faintly flies 574 , sweating with guilty fear,</p>
<p>She stays, exclaiming on 575 the direful night.</p>
<p>He runs and chides his vanished, loathed delight.</p>
<p>He thence departs a heavy convertite 576 ,</p>
<p>She there remains a hopeless castaway 577 .</p>
<p>He in his speed looks for the morning light,</p>
<p>She prays she never may behold the day.</p>
<p>‘For day’, quoth she, ’Night’s scapes 578 doth open lay 579 ,</p>
<p>And my true eyes have never practised how</p>
<p>To cloak offences with a cunning brow 580 .</p>
<p>’They think not but 581 that every eye can see</p>
<p>The same disgrace which they themselves behold,</p>
<p>And therefore would they still in darkness be 582 ,</p>
<p>To have their unseen sin remain untold.</p>
<p>For they their guilt with weeping will unfold,</p>
<p>And grave 583 , like water that doth eat in steel,</p>
<p>Upon my cheeks what helpless shame I feel.’</p>
<p>Here she exclaims against repose and rest,</p>
<p>And bids her eyes hereafter still be blind.</p>
<p>She wakes her heart by beating on her breast</p>
<p>And bids it leap from thence, where it may find</p>
<p>Some purer chest to close 584 so pure a mind.</p>
<p>Frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite 585</p>
<p>Against the unseen secrecy of night:</p>
<p>’O comfort-killing Night! Image of hell!</p>
<p>Dim register 586 and notary 587 of shame!</p>
<p>Black stage 588 for tragedies and murders fell 589 !</p>
<p>Vast sin-concealing chaos 590 ! Nurse of blame 591 !</p>
<p>Blind, muffled bawd! Dark harbour for defame 592 !</p>
<p>Grim cave of death! Whisp’ring conspirator</p>
<p>With close-tongued 593 treason and the ravisher!</p>
<p>’O hateful, vaporous and foggy Night!</p>
<p>Since thou art guilty of my cureless crime,</p>
<p>Muster 594 thy mists to meet the eastern light,</p>
<p>Make war against proportioned course of time 595 ,</p>
<p>Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb</p>
<p>His wonted 596 height, yet ere he go to bed,</p>
<p>Knit 597 poisonous clouds about his golden head.</p>
<p>’With rotten damps 598 ravish 599 the morning air,</p>
<p>Let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick</p>
<p>The life 600 of purity, the supreme fair,</p>
<p>Ere he arrive 601 his weary noontide prick 602 ,</p>
<p>And let thy musty vapours march so thick</p>
<p>That in their smoky ranks his smothered light</p>
<p>May set at noon and make perpetual night.</p>
<p>’Were Tarquin Night, as he is but Night’s child,</p>
<p>The silver-shining queen 603 he would distain 604 .</p>
<p>Her twinkling handmaids 605 too, by him defiled,</p>
<p>Through Night’s black bosom should not peep again.</p>
<p>So should I have co-partners in my pain,</p>
<p>And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage,</p>
<p>As palmers 606 ’ chat makes short their pilgrimage.</p>
<p>’Where now I have no one to blush with me,</p>
<p>To cross their arms 607 and hang their heads with mine,</p>
<p>To mask their brows and hide their infamy,</p>
<p>But I alone alone must sit and pine 608 ,</p>
<p>Seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine,</p>
<p>Mingling my talk with tears, my grief with groans,</p>
<p>Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans 609 .</p>
<p>’O Night, thou furnace of foul-reeking 610 smoke,</p>
<p>Let not the jealous day behold that face</p>
<p>Which underneath thy black all-hiding cloak</p>
<p>Immodestly lies martyred with disgrace.</p>
<p>Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,</p>
<p>That all the faults which in thy reign are made</p>
<p>May likewise be sepulchred 611 in thy shade.</p>
<p>’Make me not object 612 to the tell-tale day:</p>
<p>The light will show, charactered in my brow,</p>
<p>The story of sweet chastity’s decay,</p>
<p>The impious breach of holy wedlock vow.</p>
<p>Yea, the illiterate, that know not how</p>
<p>To cipher 613 what is writ in learnèd books,</p>
<p>Will quote 614 my loathsome trespass 615 in my looks.</p>
<p>’The nurse, to still her child, will tell my story</p>
<p>And fright her crying babe with Tarquin’s name.</p>
<p>The orator, to deck 616 his oratory,</p>
<p>Will couple 617 my reproach to Tarquin’s shame.</p>
<p>Feast-finding minstrels 618 , tuning my defame 619 ,</p>
<p>Will tie 620 the hearers to attend each line,</p>
<p>How Tarquin wrongèd me, I Collatine 621 .</p>
<p>’Let my good name, that senseless reputation 622 ,</p>
<p>For Collatine’s dear love be kept unspotted.</p>
<p>If that be made a theme for disputation 623 ,</p>
<p>The branches of another root 624 are rotted,</p>
<p>And undeserved reproach to him allotted</p>
<p>That is as clear 625 from this attaint 626 of mine</p>
<p>As I, ere this, was pure to Collatine.</p>
<p>’O unseen shame! Invisible disgrace!</p>
<p>O unfelt sore! Crest-wounding 627 , private scar!</p>
<p>Reproach is stamped in Collatinus’ face,</p>
<p>And Tarquin’s eye may read the mot 628 afar,</p>
<p>How he in peace is wounded, not in war.</p>
<p>Alas, how many bear such shameful blows,</p>
<p>Which not themselves, but he that gives them knows.</p>
<p>’If, Collatine, thine honour lay in me,</p>
<p>From me by strong assault it is bereft 629 :</p>
<p>My honey lost and I, a drone-like 630 bee,</p>
<p>Have no perfection 631 of my summer left,</p>
<p>But robbed and ransacked by injurious 632 theft.</p>
<p>In thy weak hive a wand’ring wasp hath crept</p>
<p>And sucked the honey which thy chaste bee kept.</p>
<p>’Yet am I guilty of thy honour’s wrack 633 ,</p>
<p>Yet for thy honour did I entertain him 634 :</p>
<p>Coming from thee, I could not put him back 635 ,</p>
<p>For it had been dishonour to disdain 636 him.</p>
<p>Besides, of weariness he did complain him</p>
<p>And talked of virtue — O unlooked-for evil</p>
<p>When virtue is profaned in such a devil!</p>
<p>’Why should the worm 637 intrude the maiden bud?</p>
<p>Or hateful cuckoos 638 hatch in sparrows’ nests?</p>
<p>Or toads infect fair founts 639 with venom 640 mud?</p>
<p>Or tyrant folly 641 lurk in gentle 642 breasts?</p>
<p>Or kings be breakers of their own behests 643 ?</p>
<p>But no perfection is so absolute</p>
<p>That some impurity doth not pollute.</p>
<p>’The agèd man that coffers up 644 his gold</p>
<p>Is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits</p>
<p>And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold,</p>
<p>But like still-pining 645 Tantalus 646 he sits</p>
<p>And useless barns 647 the harvest of his wits,</p>
<p>Having no other pleasure of his gain</p>
<p>But torment that it cannot cure his pain.</p>
<p>’So then he hath it when he cannot use it</p>
<p>And leaves it to be mastered by his young,</p>
<p>Who in their pride do presently 648 abuse it:</p>
<p>Their father was too weak and they too strong</p>
<p>To hold their cursèd-blessèd fortune long.</p>
<p>The sweets we wish for turn to loathèd sours</p>
<p>Even in the moment that we call them ours.</p>
<p>’Unruly blasts wait on the tender spring,</p>
<p>Unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers,</p>
<p>The adder hisses where the sweet birds sing,</p>
<p>What virtue breeds iniquity devours.</p>

<p>Or kills his life or 650 else his quality 651 .</p>
<p>’O Opportunity, thy guilt is great!</p>
<p>’Tis thou that execut’st 652 the traitor’s treason:</p>
<p>Thou sets 653 the wolf where he the lamb may get.</p>
<p>Whoever plots the sin, thou point’st 654 the season 655 .</p>
<p>’Tis thou that spurn’st 656 at right, at law, at reason,</p>
<p>And in thy shady cell 657 , where none may spy him,</p>
<p>Sits Sin, to seize the souls that wander by him.</p>
<p>’Thou mak’st the vestal 658 violate her oath,</p>
<p>Thou blow’st the fire when temperance 659 is thawed,</p>
<p>Thou smother’st honesty 660 ; thou murd’rest troth 661 :</p>
<p>Thou foul abettor, thou notorious bawd,</p>
<p>Thou plantest scandal and displacest laud 662 .</p>
<p>Thou ravisher, thou traitor, thou false thief,</p>
<p>Thy honey turns to gall 663 , thy joy to grief.</p>
<p>’Thy secret pleasure turns to open shame,</p>
<p>Thy private feasting to a public fast,</p>
<p>Thy smoothing 664 titles to a ragged name 665 ,</p>
<p>Thy sugared tongue to bitter wormwood 666 taste:</p>
<p>Thy violent vanities 667 can never last.</p>
<p>How comes it then, vile Opportunity,</p>
<p>Being so bad, such numbers seek for thee?</p>
<p>’When wilt thou be the humble suppliant’s 668 friend</p>
<p>And bring him where his suit may be obtained?</p>
<p>When wilt thou sort 669 an hour great strifes to end?</p>
<p>Or free that soul which wretchedness hath chained?</p>
<p>Give physic 670 to the sick? Ease to the pained?</p>
<p>The poor, lame, blind, halt 671 , creep, cry out for thee,</p>
<p>But they ne’er meet with Opportunity.</p>
<p>’The patient dies while the physician sleeps,</p>
<p>The orphan pines 672 while the oppressor feeds.</p>
<p>Justice is feasting while the widow weeps,</p>
<p>Advice 673 is sporting 674 while infection breeds.</p>
<p>Thou grant’st no time for charitable deeds.</p>
<p>Wrath, envy, treason, rape and murder’s rages,</p>
<p>Thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages 675 .</p>
<p>’When Truth and Virtue have to do with thee,</p>

<p>As well to hear as grant what he hath said.</p>
<p>My Collatine would else 679 have come to me</p>
<p>When Tarquin did, but he was stayed 680 by thee.</p>
<p>’Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,</p>
<p>Guilty of perjury and subornation 681 ,</p>
<p>Guilty of treason, forgery and shift 682 ,</p>
<p>Guilty of incest, that abomination:</p>
<p>An accessary by thine inclination 683</p>

<p>’Misshapen Time, copesmate 685 of ugly Night,</p>
<p>Swift subtle post 686 , carrier 687 of grisly care,</p>
<p>Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,</p>
<p>Base watch of woes 688 , sin’s packhorse 689 , virtue’s snare,</p>
<p>Thou nursest all and murd’rest all that are.</p>
<p>O, hear me then, injurious, shifting Time,</p>
<p>Be guilty of my death, since of 690 my crime.</p>
<p>’Why hath thy servant, Opportunity,</p>
<p>Betrayed the hours thou gav’st me to repose?</p>
<p>Cancelled my fortunes and enchainèd me</p>
<p>To endless date 691 of never-ending woes?</p>
<p>Time’s office 692 is to fine 693 the hate of foes,</p>
<p>To eat up errors by opinion 694 bred,</p>
<p>Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed.</p>
<p>’Time’s glory is to calm contending 695 kings,</p>
<p>To unmask falsehood and bring truth to light,</p>
<p>To stamp the seal of time in agèd things,</p>
<p>To wake the morn and sentinel 696 the night,</p>
<p>To wrong the wronger till he render right,</p>
<p>To ruinate 697 proud buildings with thy hours</p>
<p>And smear with dust their glitt’ring golden towers,</p>
<p>’To fill with worm-holes stately monuments,</p>
<p>To feed oblivion with decay of things,</p>
<p>To blot old books and alter their contents,</p>
<p>To pluck the quills 698 from ancient ravens’ wings,</p>
<p>To dry the old oak’s sap and cherish springs 699 ,</p>
<p>To spoil antiquities of hammered steel</p>
<p>And turn the giddy round of Fortune’s wheel 700 ,</p>
<p>’To show the beldame 701 daughters of her daughter,</p>
<p>To make the child a man, the man a child 702 ,</p>
<p>To slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter,</p>
<p>To tame the unicorn and lion wild,</p>
<p>To mock the subtle 703 in themselves beguiled 704 ,</p>

<p>Would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends,</p>
<p>Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends 709 .</p>
<p>O, this dread Night, wouldst thou one hour come back,</p>
<p>I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack.</p>
<p>’Thou ceaseless lackey 710 to eternity,</p>
<p>With some mischance cross 711 Tarquin in his flight,</p>
<p>Devise extremes beyond extremity</p>
<p>To make him curse this cursèd crimeful night,</p>
<p>Let ghastly 712 shadows his lewd 713 eyes affright,</p>
<p>And the dire thought of his committed evil</p>
<p>Shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil.</p>
<p>’Disturb his hours of rest with restless trances 714 ,</p>
<p>Afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans,</p>

<p>To make him moan, but pity not his moans.</p>
<p>Stone him with hardened hearts harder than stones,</p>
<p>And let mild women to him lose their mildness,</p>
<p>Wilder to him than tigers in their wildness.</p>
<p>’Let him have time to tear his curlèd hair,</p>
<p>Let him have time against himself to rave,</p>
<p>Let him have time of Time’s help to despair,</p>
<p>Let him have time to live a loathèd slave,</p>
<p>Let him have time a beggar’s orts 716 to crave,</p>
<p>And time to see one that by alms doth live 717</p>
<p>Disdain to him disdainèd 718 scraps to give 719 .</p>
<p>’Let him have time to see his friends his foes</p>
<p>And merry fools to mock at him resort 720 ,</p>
<p>Let him have time to mark how slow time goes</p>
<p>In time of sorrow and how swift and short</p>
<p>His time of folly and his time of sport 721 .</p>
<p>And ever let his unrecalling 722 crime</p>
<p>Have time to wail th’abusing 723 of his time.</p>
<p>’O Time, thou tutor both to good and bad,</p>
<p>Teach me to curse him that 724 thou taught’st this ill.</p>
<p>At his own shadow let the thief run mad,</p>

<p>Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill,</p>
<p>For who so base would such an office have</p>
<p>As sland’rous deathsman 725 to so base a slave?</p>
<p>’The baser is he, coming 726 from a king,</p>
<p>To shame his hope 727 with deeds degenerate.</p>
<p>The mightier man, the mightier is the thing</p>
<p>That makes him honoured or begets him hate 728 :</p>
<p>For greatest scandal waits on 729 greatest state 730 .</p>
<p>The moon being clouded presently 731 is missed,</p>
<p>But little stars may hide them when they list.</p>
<p>’The crow may bathe his coal-black wings in mire 732</p>
<p>And unperceived fly with the filth away,</p>
<p>But if the like 733 the snow-white swan desire,</p>
<p>The stain upon his silver down will stay.</p>
<p>Poor grooms 734 are sightless night, kings glorious day,</p>
<p>Gnats are unnoted wheresoe’er they fly,</p>
<p>But eagles gazed upon with every eye.</p>
<p>’Out 735 , idle 736 words, servants to shallow fools,</p>
<p>Unprofitable sounds, weak arbitrator 737 s!</p>
<p>Busy yourselves in skill-contending schools 738 ,</p>
<p>Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters,</p>
<p>To trembling clients be you mediators.</p>
<p>For me, I force not argument a straw 739 ,</p>
<p>Since that my case 740 is past the help of law.</p>
<p>’In vain I rail 741 at Opportunity,</p>
<p>At Time, at Tarquin and uncheerful Night,</p>
<p>In vain I cavil 742 with mine infamy,</p>
<p>In vain I spurn 743 at my confirmed despite 744 :</p>
<p>This helpless smoke of words doth me no right.</p>
<p>The remedy indeed to do me good</p>
<p>Is to let forth my foul defilèd blood 745 .</p>
<p>’Poor hand, why quiver’st thou at this decree?</p>
<p>Honour thyself to rid me of this shame,</p>
<p>For if I die my honour lives in thee,</p>
<p>But if I live thou liv’st in my defame.</p>
<p>Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame</p>
<p>And wast afeard to scratch her wicked foe,</p>
<p>Kill both thyself and her for yielding so.’</p>
<p>This said, from her betumbled couch 746 she starteth,</p>
<p>To find some desp’rate instrument of death.</p>
<p>But this, no slaughterhouse, no tool imparteth 747</p>
<p>To make more vent for passage of her breath,</p>
<p>Which thronging 748 through her lips, so vanisheth</p>
<p>As smoke from Aetna 749 that in air consumes 750</p>
<p>Or that which from dischargèd cannon fumes 751 .</p>
<p>‘In vain,’ quoth she, ’I live and seek in vain</p>
<p>Some happy mean to end a hapless 752 life.</p>
<p>I feared by Tarquin’s falchion 753 to be slain,</p>
<p>Yet for the self-same purpose seek a knife;</p>
<p>But when I feared I was a loyal wife.</p>
<p>So am I now — O no, that cannot be!</p>
<p>Of that true type 754 hath Tarquin rifled me.</p>
<p>’O, that is gone for which I sought to live,</p>
<p>And therefore now I need not fear to die.</p>
<p>To clear this spot 755 by death, at least I give</p>
<p>A badge of fame to slander’s livery 756 757 ,</p>
<p>A dying life to living infamy:</p>
<p>Poor helpless help, the treasure stol’n away,</p>
<p>To burn the guiltless casket where it lay.</p>
<p>’Well, well, dear Collatine, thou shalt not know</p>
<p>The stainèd taste of violated troth,</p>
<p>I will not wrong thy true affection so,</p>
<p>To flatter 758 thee with an infringèd 759 oath.</p>
<p>This bastard graff 760 shall never come to growth:</p>
<p>He shall not boast who did thy stock 761 pollute,</p>
<p>That thou art doting father of his fruit.</p>
<p>’Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought,</p>
<p>Nor laugh with his companions at thy state,</p>
<p>But thou shalt know thy int’rest 762 was not bought</p>
<p>Basely with gold, but stol’n from forth thy gate.</p>
<p>For me, I am the mistress of my fate,</p>
<p>And with my trespass never will dispense 763</p>
<p>Till life to death acquit my forced offence.</p>
<p>’I will not poison thee with my attaint 764</p>
<p>Nor fold my fault in cleanly coined 765 excuses.</p>
<p>My sable ground 766 of sin I will not paint</p>
<p>To hide the truth of this false night’s 767 abuses.</p>
<p>My tongue shall utter all, mine eyes like sluices,</p>
<p>As from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale 768 ,</p>
<p>Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale.’</p>
<p>By this 769 , lamenting Philomel 770 had ended</p>
<p>The well-tuned warble of her nightly sorrow,</p>
<p>And solemn night with slow, sad gait descended</p>
<p>To ugly hell, when, lo, the blushing morrow</p>
<p>Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow.</p>
<p>But cloudy 771 Lucrece shames herself to see,</p>
<p>And therefore still in night would cloistered be.</p>
<p>Revealing day through every cranny spies</p>
<p>And seems to point her out where she sits weeping,</p>
<p>To whom she sobbing speaks: ’O eye of eyes,</p>
<p>Why pry’st thou 772 through my window? Leave thy peeping,</p>
<p>Mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping,</p>
<p>Brand not my forehead with thy piercing light,</p>
<p>For day hath nought to do 773 what’s done by night.’</p>
<p>Thus cavils she with everything she sees:</p>
<p>True grief is fond 774 and testy 775 as a child,</p>
<p>Who wayward 776 once, his mood with nought agrees:</p>
<p>Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild 777 ,</p>
<p>Continuance 778 tames the one, the other wild,</p>
<p>Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still,</p>
<p>With too much labour drowns for want of skill.</p>
<p>So she, deep-drenchèd 779 in a sea of care,</p>
<p>Holds disputation with each thing she views</p>
<p>And to herself all sorrow doth compare.</p>
<p>No object but her passion’s strength renews 780 ,</p>
<p>And as one shifts, another straight 781 ensues.</p>
<p>Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words,</p>
<p>Sometime ’tis mad and too much talk affords.</p>
<p>The little birds that tune their morning’s joy</p>
<p>Make her moans mad with their sweet melody,</p>
<p>For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy 782 .</p>
<p>Sad souls are slain in merry company,</p>
<p>Grief best is pleased with grief’s society:</p>
<p>True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed 783</p>
<p>When with like semblance it is sympathized 784 .</p>
<p>’Tis double death to drown in ken 785 of shore,</p>
<p>He ten times pines 786 that pines beholding food,</p>
<p>To see the salve 787 doth make the wound ache more,</p>
<p>Great grief grieves most at that 788 would do it good,</p>
<p>Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,</p>
<p>Who, being stopped, the bounding 789 banks o’erflows:</p>
<p>Grief dallied 790 with nor law nor 791 limit knows.</p>
<p>‘You mocking-birds,’ quoth she, ’your tunes entomb</p>
<p>Within your hollow-swelling feathered breasts,</p>
<p>And in my hearing be you mute and dumb,</p>
<p>My restless 792 discord loves no stops nor rests 793 :</p>
<p>A woeful hostess brooks 794 not merry guests.</p>
<p>Relish 795 your nimble notes to pleasing ears 796 :</p>
<p>Distress likes dumps 797 when time is kept with tears.</p>
<p>’Come, Philomel, that sing’st of ravishment,</p>
<p>Make thy sad grove in my dishevelled 798 hair.</p>
<p>As the dank earth weeps at thy languishment 799 ,</p>
<p>So I at each sad strain will strain 800 a tear</p>
<p>And with deep groans the diapason 801 bear:</p>
<p>For burden-wise 802 I’ll hum on Tarquin still,</p>
<p>While thou on Tereus 803 descants 804 better skill 805 .</p>
<p>’And whiles against a thorn thou bear’st thy part,</p>
<p>To keep thy sharp woes waking 806 , wretched I,</p>
<p>To imitate thee well, against my heart</p>
<p>Will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye,</p>
<p>Who, if it wink 807 , shall thereon fall and die.</p>
<p>These means, as frets 808 upon an instrument,</p>
<p>Shall tune our heartstrings to true languishment.</p>
<p>’And for 809 , poor bird, thou sing’st not in the day,</p>
<p>As shaming 810 any eye should thee behold,</p>
<p>Some dark deep desert 811 , seated from the way 812 ,</p>
<p>That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold</p>
<p>Will we find out, and there we will unfold</p>
<p>To creatures stern 813 , sad tunes to change their kinds 814 :</p>
<p>Since men prove beasts, let beasts bear gentle minds.’</p>
<p>As the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze 815 ,</p>
<p>Wildly determining which way to fly,</p>
<p>Or one encompassed 816 with a winding maze</p>
<p>That cannot tread the way out readily,</p>
<p>So with herself is she in mutiny:</p>
<p>To live or die which of the twain were better,</p>
<p>When life is shamed and death reproach’s debtor 817 .</p>
<p>‘To kill myself,’ quoth she, ’alack, what were it</p>
<p>But with my body my poor soul’s pollution 818 ?</p>
<p>They that lose half with greater patience bear it</p>
<p>Than they whose whole is swallowed in confusion 819 .</p>
<p>That mother tries 820 a merciless conclusion</p>
<p>Who, having two sweet babes, when death takes one,</p>
<p>Will slay the other and be nurse to none.</p>
<p>’My body or my soul, which was the dearer,</p>
<p>When the one pure, the other made divine 821 ?</p>
<p>Whose love of either to myself was nearer 822</p>
<p>When both were kept for heaven and Collatine?</p>
<p>Ay me! The bark peeled from the lofty pine,</p>
<p>His leaves will wither and his sap decay,</p>
<p>So must my soul, her bark being peeled away.</p>
<p>’Her house is sacked 823 , her quiet interrupted,</p>
<p>Her mansion battered by the enemy,</p>
<p>Her sacred temple spotted, spoiled, corrupted,</p>
<p>Grossly engirt 824 with daring infamy.</p>
<p>Then let it not be called impiety,</p>
<p>If in this blemished fort 825 I make some hole</p>
<p>Through which I may convey this troubled soul.</p>
<p>’Yet die I will not till my Collatine</p>
<p>Have heard the cause of my untimely death,</p>
<p>That he may vow, in that sad hour of mine,</p>
<p>Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.</p>
<p>My stainèd blood to Tarquin I’ll bequeath,</p>
<p>Which by him tainted shall for him be spent 826 ,</p>
<p>And as his due writ in my testament 827 .</p>
<p>’My honour I’ll bequeath unto the knife</p>
<p>That wounds my body so dishonourèd.</p>
<p>’Tis honour to deprive 828 dishonoured life:</p>
<p>The one will live, the other being dead.</p>
<p>So of shame’s ashes shall my fame 829 be bred,</p>
<p>For in my death I murder shameful scorn:</p>
<p>My shame so dead, mine honour is newborn.</p>
<p>’Dear lord of that dear jewel 830 I have lost,</p>
<p>What legacy shall I bequeath to thee?</p>
<p>My resolution 831 , love, shall be thy boast,</p>
<p>By whose example thou revenged may’st be.</p>
<p>How Tarquin must be used 832 , read it in me:</p>
<p>Myself, thy friend, will kill myself, thy foe,</p>
<p>And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so.</p>
<p>’This brief abridgement of my will I make:</p>
<p>My soul and body to 833 the skies and ground,</p>
<p>My resolution, husband, do thou take,</p>
<p>Mine honour be the knife’s that makes my wound,</p>
<p>My shame be his that did my fame confound 834 ,</p>
<p>And all my fame that lives disbursèd 835 be</p>
<p>To those that live and think no shame of me.</p>
<p>’Thou, Collatine, shalt oversee 836 this will —</p>
<p>How was I overseen 837 that thou shalt see it!</p>
<p>My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill,</p>
<p>My life’s foul deed my life’s fair end shall free it.</p>
<p>Faint not, faint heart, but stoutly say ‘’So be it.’’</p>
<p>Yield to my hand, my hand shall conquer thee:</p>
<p>Thou dead, both die and both shall victors be.’</p>
<p>This plot of death when sadly she had laid</p>
<p>And wiped the brinish pearl 838 from her bright eyes,</p>
<p>With untuned 839 tongue she hoarsely calls her maid,</p>
<p>Whose swift obedience to her mistress hies 840 ,</p>
<p>For fleet-winged duty with thought’s feathers 841 flies.</p>
<p>Poor Lucrece’ cheeks unto her maid seem so</p>
<p>As winter meads 842 when sun doth melt their snow.</p>
<p>Her mistress she doth give demure good morrow</p>
<p>With soft, slow tongue, true mark of modesty,</p>
<p>And sorts 843 a sad look to her lady’s sorrow,</p>
<p>For why 844 her face wore sorrow’s livery,</p>
<p>But durst not ask of her audaciously 845</p>
<p>Why her two suns were cloud-eclipsèd so,</p>
<p>Nor why her fair cheeks over-washed with woe.</p>
<p>But as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,</p>
<p>Each flower moistened like a melting eye,</p>
<p>Even so the maid with swelling drops gan 846 wet</p>
<p>Her circled eyne 847 , enforced 848 by sympathy</p>
<p>Of those fair suns set in her mistress’ sky,</p>
<p>Who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light,</p>
<p>Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night.</p>
<p>A pretty while these pretty creatures stand,</p>
<p>Like ivory conduits coral cisterns 849 filling:</p>
<p>One justly 850 weeps, the other takes in hand</p>
<p>No cause, but company 851 , of her drops spilling.</p>
<p>Their gentle sex to weep are often willing,</p>
<p>Grieving themselves to guess at others’ smarts 852 ,</p>
<p>And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts.</p>
<p>For men have marble, women waxen minds,</p>
<p>And therefore are they formed as marble will 853 :</p>
<p>The weak oppressed, th’impression of strange kinds 854</p>
<p>Is formed in them by force, by fraud, or skill 855 .</p>
<p>Then call them not the authors of their ill,</p>
<p>No more than wax shall be accounted evil</p>
<p>Wherein is stamped the semblance 856 of a devil.</p>
<p>Their smoothness, like a goodly champaign 857 plain,</p>
<p>Lays open 858 all the little worms that creep.</p>
<p>In men, as in a rough-grown grove, remain</p>
<p>Cave-keeping 859 evils that obscurely 860 sleep.</p>
<p>Through crystal walls each little mote 861 will peep,</p>
<p>Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks,</p>
<p>Poor women’s faces are their own faults’ books.</p>
<p>No man inveigh against 862 the withered flow’r,</p>
<p>But chide 863 rough winter that the flow’r hath killed:</p>
<p>Not that devoured, but that which doth devour,</p>
<p>Is worthy blame. O, let it not be hild 864</p>
<p>Poor women’s faults, that they are so fulfilled</p>
<p>With men’s abuses: those proud lords, to blame,</p>
<p>Make weak-made women tenants to their 865 shame.</p>
<p>The precedent 866 whereof in Lucrece’ view,</p>
<p>Assailed 867 by night with circumstances strong</p>
<p>Of present death 868 and shame that might ensue</p>
<p>By that 869 her death, to do her husband wrong.</p>
<p>Such danger to resistance did belong</p>
<p>That dying fear 870 through all her body spread,</p>
<p>And who cannot abuse a body dead?</p>
<p>By this, mild patience bid fair Lucrece speak</p>
<p>To the poor counterfeit 871 of her complaining:</p>
<p>‘My girl,’ quoth she, ’on what occasion break</p>
<p>Those tears from thee that down thy cheeks are raining?</p>
<p>If thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining 872 ,</p>
<p>Know, gentle wench, it small avails 873 my mood:</p>
<p>If tears could help, mine own would do me good.</p>
<p>‘But tell me, girl, when went’ — and there she stayed 874</p>
<p>Till after a deep groan — ‘Tarquin from hence?’</p>
<p>‘Madam, ere I was up’, replied the maid,</p>
<p>’The more to blame my sluggard 875 negligence.</p>
<p>Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense 876 :</p>
<p>Myself was stirring ere the break of day,</p>
<p>And, ere I rose, was Tarquin gone away.</p>
<p>’But, lady, if your maid may be so bold,</p>
<p>She would request to know your heaviness 877 .’</p>
<p>‘O, peace!’ quoth Lucrece. ’If it should be told,</p>
<p>The repetition cannot make it less:</p>
<p>For more it is than I can well express,</p>
<p>And that deep torture may be called a hell</p>
<p>When more is felt than one hath power to tell.</p>
<p>’Go, get me hither paper, ink and pen —</p>
<p>Yet save that labour, for I have them here.</p>
<p>What should I say? One of my husband’s men</p>
<p>Bid thou be ready, by and by, to bear</p>
<p>A letter to my lord, my love, my dear.</p>
<p>Bid him with speed prepare to carry it.</p>
<p>The cause craves haste and it will soon be writ.’</p>
<p>Her maid is gone and she prepares to write,</p>
<p>First hovering o’er the paper with her quill.</p>
<p>Conceit 878 and grief an eager combat fight:</p>
<p>What wit 879 sets down is blotted straight 880 with will 881 .</p>
<p>This is too curious good 882 , this blunt and ill 883 :</p>
<p>Much like a press of people at a door</p>
<p>Throng her inventions 884 which shall go before 885 .</p>
<p>At last she thus begins: ’Thou worthy lord</p>
<p>Of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee,</p>
<p>Health to thy person. Next vouchsafe t’afford 886 —</p>
<p>If ever, love, thy Lucrece thou wilt see —</p>
<p>Some present speed to come and visit me.</p>
<p>So I commend me 887 , from our house in grief:</p>
<p>My woes are tedious 888 though my words are brief.’</p>
<p>Here folds she up the tenor 889 of her woe,</p>
<p>Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly.</p>
<p>By this short schedule 890 Collatine may know</p>
<p>Her grief, but not her grief’s true quality:</p>
<p>She dares not thereof make discovery 891 ,</p>
<p>Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,</p>
<p>Ere she with blood had stained her stained excuse 892 .</p>
<p>Besides, the life and feeling of her passion 893</p>
<p>She hoards, to spend when he is by to hear her,</p>
<p>When sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion</p>
<p>Of her disgrace, the better so to clear her</p>
<p>From that suspicion which the world might bear her.</p>
<p>To shun this blot, she would not blot the letter</p>
<p>With words, till action 894 might become 895 them better.</p>
<p>To see sad sights moves more than hear them told,</p>
<p>For then the eye interprets to the ear</p>
<p>The heavy motion 896 that it doth behold,</p>
<p>When every part a part of woe doth bear 897 .</p>
<p>’Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear:</p>
<p>Deep sounds 898 make lesser noise than shallow fords,</p>
<p>And sorrow ebbs, being blown with wind of words 899 .</p>
<p>Her letter now is sealed and on it writ</p>
<p>‘At Ardea to my lord with more than haste’.</p>
<p>The post 900 attends and she delivers it,</p>
<p>Charging 901 the sour-faced groom to hie as fast</p>
<p>As lagging 902 fowls before the northern blast.</p>
<p>Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems 903 :</p>
<p>Extremity still urgeth such extremes.</p>
<p>The homely villain 904 curtsies 905 to her low,</p>
<p>And, blushing on her, with a steadfast eye</p>
<p>Receives the scroll without or yea 906 or no</p>
<p>And forth with bashful innocence doth hie.</p>
<p>But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie</p>
<p>Imagine every eye beholds their blame:</p>
<p>For Lucrece thought he blushed to see her shame,</p>
<p>When, silly 907 groom, God wot 908 , it was defect 909</p>
<p>Of spirit, life and bold audacity.</p>
<p>Such harmless creatures have a true respect</p>
<p>To talk in deeds, while others saucily</p>
<p>Promise more speed, but do it leisurely.</p>
<p>Even so this pattern of the worn-out age 910</p>
<p>Pawned 911 honest looks, but laid no words to gage 912 .</p>
<p>His kindled 913 duty kindled her mistrust,</p>
<p>That two red fires in both their faces blazed.</p>
<p>She thought he blushed, as knowing Tarquin’s lust,</p>
<p>And, blushing with him, wistly 914 on him gazed.</p>
<p>Her earnest eye did make him more amazed 915 .</p>
<p>The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish,</p>
<p>The more she thought he spied in her some blemish.</p>
<p>But long she thinks 916 till he return again,</p>
<p>And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone.</p>
<p>The weary time she cannot entertain 917 ,</p>
<p>For now ’tis stale 918 to sigh, to weep and groan:</p>
<p>So woe hath wearied woe, moan tirèd moan,</p>
<p>That she her plaints 919 a little while doth stay 920 ,</p>
<p>Pausing for means to mourn some newer way.</p>
<p>At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece</p>
<p>Of skilful painting, made for Priam’s Troy 921 ,</p>
<p>Before the which is drawn 922 the power 923 of Greece,</p>
<p>For Helen’s rape 924 the city to destroy,</p>
<p>Threat’ning cloud-kissing Ilion 925 with annoy 926 ,</p>
<p>Which the conceited 927 painter drew so proud 928</p>
<p>As heaven, it seemed, to kiss the turrets bowed.</p>
<p>A thousand lamentable objects there,</p>
<p>In scorn 929 of nature, art gave lifeless life 930 .</p>
<p>Many a dry drop seemed a weeping tear</p>
<p>Shed for the slaughtered husband by the wife.</p>
<p>The red blood reeked 931 , to show the painter’s strife 932 ,</p>
<p>And dying eyes gleamed forth their ashy lights,</p>
<p>Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights.</p>
<p>There might you see the labouring pioneer 933</p>
<p>Begrimed with sweat and smearèd all with dust,</p>
<p>And from the towers of Troy there would appear</p>
<p>The very eyes of men through loopholes 934 thrust,</p>
<p>Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust 935 :</p>
<p>Such sweet observance 936 in this work was had</p>
<p>That one might see those far-off eyes look sad.</p>
<p>In great commanders grace and majesty</p>
<p>You might behold, triumphing in their faces.</p>
<p>In youth, quick 937 bearing and dexterity.</p>
<p>And here and there the painter interlaces 938</p>
<p>Pale cowards, marching on with trembling paces,</p>
<p>Which heartless peasants did so well resemble</p>
<p>That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble.</p>
<p>In Ajax and Ulysses 939 , O, what art</p>
<p>Of physiognomy 940 might one behold!</p>
<p>The face of either ciphered 941 either’s 942 heart.</p>
<p>Their face their manners most expressly told:</p>
<p>In Ajax’ eyes blunt 943 rage and rigour 944 rolled,</p>
<p>But the mild glance that sly 945 Ulysses lent</p>
<p>Showed deep regard 946 and smiling government 947 .</p>
<p>There pleading 948 might you see grave 949 Nestor 950 stand,</p>
<p>As ’twere encouraging the Greeks to fight,</p>
<p>Making such sober action 951 with his hand,</p>
<p>That it beguiled 952 attention, charmed the sight.</p>
<p>In speech, it seemed, his beard, all silver white,</p>
<p>Wagged up and down and from his lips did fly</p>
<p>Thin winding breath which purled 953 up to the sky.</p>
<p>About him were a press of gaping faces,</p>
<p>Which seemed to swallow up his sound advice,</p>
<p>All jointly list’ning, but with several graces 954 ,</p>
<p>As if some mermaid did their ears entice,</p>
<p>Some high, some low — the painter was so nice 955 .</p>
<p>The scalps of many, almost hid behind,</p>
<p>To jump up higher seemed, to mock the mind 956 .</p>
<p>Here one man’s hand leaned on another’s head,</p>
<p>His nose being shadowed by his neighbour’s ear.</p>
<p>Here one, being thronged 957 , bears 958 back, all boll’n 959 and
red.</p>
<p>Another smothered seems to pelt 960 and swear,</p>
<p>And in their rage such signs of rage they bear</p>
<p>As, but for loss of 961 Nestor’s golden words,</p>
<p>It seemed they would debate with angry swords.</p>
<p>For much imaginary work was there:</p>
<p>Conceit deceitful 962 , so compact 963 , so kind 964 ,</p>
<p>That for Achilles’ image stood his spear 965 ,</p>
<p>Gripped in an armèd hand, himself behind</p>
<p>Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind:</p>
<p>A hand, a foot, a face, a leg, a head</p>
<p>Stood for the whole to be imaginèd.</p>
<p>And from the walls of strong besiegèd Troy,</p>
<p>When their brave hope, bold Hector 966 , marched to field,</p>
<p>Stood many Trojan mothers, sharing joy</p>
<p>To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield,</p>
<p>And to their hope they such odd 967 action yield 968</p>
<p>That through their light joy seemèd to appear,</p>
<p>Like bright things stained, a kind of heavy fear.</p>
<p>And from the strand of Dardan 969 , where they fought,</p>
<p>To Simois 970 ’ reedy banks the red blood ran,</p>
<p>Whose waves to imitate the battle sought</p>
<p>With swelling ridges 971 and their ranks began</p>
<p>To break upon the gallèd 972 shore and then 973</p>
<p>Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,</p>
<p>They join and shoot their foam at Simois’ banks.</p>
<p>To this well-painted piece is Lucrece come,</p>
<p>To find a face where all distress is stelled 974 .</p>
<p>Many she sees where cares have carvèd some 975 ,</p>
<p>But none where all distress and dolour 976 dwelled</p>
<p>Till she despairing Hecuba 977 beheld,</p>
<p>Staring on Priam’s wounds, with her old eyes,</p>
<p>Which bleeding under Pyrrhus’ proud foot lies.</p>
<p>In her the painter had anatomized 978</p>
<p>Time’s ruin, beauty’s wrack and grim care’s reign.</p>
<p>Her cheeks with chaps 979 and wrinkles were disguised:</p>
<p>Of what she was 980 no semblance did remain.</p>
<p>Her blue 981 blood changed to black 982 in every vein,</p>
<p>Wanting the spring 983 that those shrunk pipes 984 had fed,</p>
<p>Showed life imprisoned in a body dead.</p>
<p>On this sad shadow 985 Lucrece spends 986 her eyes</p>
<p>And shapes her sorrow to the beldame 987 ’s woes,</p>
<p>Who nothing wants to answer her 988 but cries</p>
<p>And bitter words to ban 989 her cruel foes.</p>
<p>The painter was no god to lend her those 990 ,</p>
<p>And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong</p>
<p>To give her so much grief and not a tongue.</p>
<p>‘Poor instrument,’ quoth she, ’without a sound,</p>
<p>I’ll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue,</p>
<p>And drop sweet balm in Priam’s painted wound,</p>
<p>And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong,</p>
<p>And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long,</p>
<p>And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes</p>
<p>Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies.</p>
<p>’Show me the strumpet 991 that began this stir,</p>
<p>That with my nails her beauty I may tear.</p>
<p>Thy heat of lust, fond 992 Paris, did incur</p>
<p>This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear.</p>
<p>Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here,</p>
<p>And here in Troy, for trespass of thine eye,</p>
<p>The sire, the son, the dame 993 , and daughter die.</p>
<p>’Why should the private pleasure of some one</p>
<p>Become the public plague of many moe 994 ?</p>
<p>Let sin, alone committed, light 995 alone</p>
<p>Upon his head that hath transgressèd so.</p>
<p>Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe.</p>
<p>For one’s offence why should so many fall,</p>
<p>To plague a private sin in general 996 ?</p>
<p>’Lo, here weeps Hecuba, here Priam dies,</p>
<p>Here manly Hector faints, here Troilus 997 swoons 998 ,</p>
<p>Here friend by friend in bloody channel 999 lies,</p>
<p>And friend to friend gives unadvisèd 1000 wounds,</p>
<p>And one man’s lust these many lives confounds.</p>
<p>Had doting 1001 Priam checked 1002 his son’s desire,</p>
<p>Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire.’</p>
<p>Here feelingly she weeps Troy’s painted woes,</p>
<p>For sorrow, like a heavy-hanging bell,</p>
<p>Once set on ringing, with his own weight goes 1003 ;</p>
<p>Then little strength rings out the doleful knell 1004 .</p>
<p>So Lucrece, set a-work 1005 , sad tales doth tell</p>
<p>To pencilled pensiveness and coloured sorrow 1006 :</p>
<p>She lends them words and she their looks doth borrow.</p>
<p>She throws her eyes about the painting round,</p>
<p>And whom she finds forlorn she doth lament.</p>
<p>At last she sees a wretched image bound 1007 ,</p>
<p>That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent 1008 .</p>
<p>His face, though full of cares, yet showed content.</p>
<p>Onward to Troy with the blunt swains 1009 he goes,</p>
<p>So mild, that patience seemed to scorn his woes.</p>
<p>In him the painter laboured with his skill</p>
<p>To hide deceit and give the harmless show 1010</p>
<p>An humble gait, calm looks, eyes wailing still 1011 ,</p>
<p>A brow unbent 1012 that seemed to welcome woe,</p>
<p>Cheeks neither red nor pale, but mingled so</p>
<p>That blushing red no guilty instance 1013 gave,</p>
<p>Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have.</p>
<p>But, like a constant and confirmèd devil,</p>
<p>He entertained a show 1014 so seeming just,</p>
<p>And therein so ensconced 1015 his secret evil,</p>
<p>That jealousy itself could not mistrust</p>
<p>False-creeping craft and perjury should thrust</p>
<p>Into so bright a day such black-faced storms</p>
<p>Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.</p>
<p>The well-skilled workman 1016 this mild image drew</p>
<p>For perjured Sinon whose enchanting 1017 story</p>
<p>The credulous old Priam after slew,</p>
<p>Whose words like wildfire 1018 burnt the shining glory</p>
<p>Of rich-built Ilion, that the skies were sorry,</p>
<p>And little stars shot from their fixèd places,</p>
<p>When their glass 1019 fell wherein they viewed their faces.</p>
<p>This picture she advisedly 1020 perused</p>
<p>And chid the painter for his wondrous skill,</p>
<p>Saying, some shape in Sinon’s was abused 1021 :</p>
<p>So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill.</p>
<p>And still on him she gazed, and gazing still,</p>
<p>Such signs of truth in his plain 1022 face she spied</p>
<p>That she concludes the picture was belied 1023 .</p>
<p>‘It cannot be,’ quoth she, ‘that so much guile’ —</p>
<p>She would have said ‘can lurk in such a look,’</p>
<p>But Tarquin’s shape came in her mind the while</p>
<p>And from her tongue ‘can lurk’ from ‘cannot’ took.</p>
<p>‘It cannot be’ she in that sense forsook</p>
<p>And turned it 1024 thus, ’It cannot be, I find,</p>
<p>But 1025 such a face should bear a wicked mind.</p>
<p>’For even as subtle Sinon here is painted,</p>
<p>So sober-sad, so weary and so mild,</p>
<p>As if with grief or travail 1026 he had fainted,</p>
<p>To me came Tarquin armèd to beguild 1027</p>
<p>With outward honesty but yet defiled</p>
<p>With inward vice: as Priam him 1028 did cherish,</p>
<p>So did I Tarquin; so my Troy did perish.</p>
<p>’Look, look, how list’ning Priam wets his eyes</p>
<p>To see those borrowed tears that Sinon sheds!</p>
<p>Priam, why art thou old and yet not wise?</p>
<p>For every tear he falls 1029 a Trojan bleeds:</p>
<p>His eye drops fire, no water thence proceeds.</p>
<p>Those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity</p>
<p>Are balls of quenchless fire 1030 to burn thy city.</p>
<p>’Such devils steal effects 1031 from lightless hell,</p>
<p>For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold</p>
<p>And in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell.</p>
<p>These contraries such unity do hold</p>
<p>Only to flatter fools and make them bold:</p>
<p>So Priam’s trust false Sinon’s tears doth flatter,</p>
<p>That he finds means to burn his Troy with water.’</p>
<p>Here, all enraged, such passion her assails</p>
<p>That patience is quite beaten from her breast.</p>
<p>She tears the senseless 1032 Sinon with her nails,</p>
<p>Comparing him to that unhappy 1033 guest</p>
<p>Whose deed hath made herself herself detest.</p>
<p>At last she smilingly with this gives o’er 1034 :</p>
<p>‘Fool, fool!’ quoth she, ‘His wounds will not be sore.’</p>
<p>Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow,</p>
<p>And time doth weary time with her complaining.</p>
<p>She looks for night and then she longs for morrow,</p>
<p>And both she thinks too long with her remaining.</p>
<p>Short time seems long in sorrow’s sharp sustaining 1035 :</p>
<p>Though woe be heavy 1036 , yet it seldom sleeps,</p>
<p>And they that watch 1037 see time how slow it creeps.</p>
<p>Which all this time hath overslipped 1038 her thought</p>
<p>That she with painted images hath spent,</p>
<p>Being from 1039 the feeling of her own grief brought</p>
<p>By deep surmise of others’ detriment 1040 ,</p>
<p>Losing her woes in shows 1041 of discontent.</p>
<p>It easeth some, though none it ever cured,</p>
<p>To think their dolour others have endured.</p>
<p>But now the mindful 1042 messenger come back</p>
<p>Brings home his lord and other company,</p>
<p>Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black,</p>
<p>And round about her tear-distainèd 1043 eye</p>
<p>Blue circles streamed 1044 , like rainbows in the sky.</p>
<p>These water-galls 1045 in her dim element 1046</p>
<p>Foretell new storms to those already spent.</p>
<p>Which when her sad-beholding husband saw,</p>
<p>Amazedly in her sad face he stares.</p>
<p>Her eyes, though sod 1047 in tears, looked red and raw,</p>
<p>Her lively colour killed with deadly cares.</p>
<p>He hath no power to ask her how she fares.</p>
<p>Both stood, like old acquaintance in a trance,</p>
<p>Met far from home, wond’ring each other’s chance 1048 .</p>
<p>At last he takes her by the bloodless hand</p>
<p>And thus begins: ’What uncouth 1049 ill event</p>
<p>Hath thee befall’n, that thou dost trembling stand?</p>
<p>Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?</p>
<p>Why art thou thus attired in discontent 1050 ?</p>
<p>Unmask, dear dear, this moody heaviness</p>
<p>And tell thy grief, that we may give redress.’</p>
<p>Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire 1051 ,</p>
<p>Ere once she can discharge one word of woe.</p>
<p>At length addressed 1052 to answer his desire,</p>
<p>She modestly prepares to let them know</p>
<p>Her honour is ta’en prisoner by the foe,</p>
<p>While Collatine and his consorted 1053 lords</p>
<p>With sad attention long to hear her words.</p>
<p>And now this pale swan in her wat’ry nest</p>
<p>Begins the sad dirge 1054 of her certain ending 1055 :</p>
<p>‘Few words,’ quoth she, ’shall fit the trespass best,</p>
<p>Where no excuse can give the fault amending.</p>
<p>In me more woes than words are now depending 1056 ,</p>
<p>And my laments would be drawn out too long</p>
<p>To tell them all with one poor tirèd tongue.</p>
<p>’Then be this all the task it hath to say:</p>
<p>Dear husband, in the interest of 1057 thy bed</p>
<p>A stranger came and on that pillow lay</p>
<p>Where thou was wont 1058 to rest thy weary head,</p>
<p>And what wrong else may be imaginèd</p>
<p>By foul enforcement might be done to me,</p>
<p>From that, alas, thy Lucrece is not free.</p>
<p>’For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight</p>
<p>With shining falchion 1059 in my chamber came</p>
<p>A creeping creature with a flaming light</p>
<p>And softly cried, ’’Awake, thou Roman dame,</p>
<p>And entertain 1060 my love, else lasting shame</p>
<p>On thee and thine this night I will inflict,</p>
<p>If thou my love’s desire do contradict.</p>
<p>’‘’For some hard-favoured groom 1061 of thine,’’ quoth he,</p>
<p>’’Unless thou yoke thy liking 1062 to my will,</p>
<p>I’ll murder straight and then I’ll slaughter thee</p>
<p>And swear I found you where you did fulfil</p>
<p>The loathsome act of lust and so did kill</p>
<p>The lechers in their deed: this act will be</p>
<p>My fame and thy perpetual infamy.’’</p>
<p>’With this I did begin to start and cry,</p>
<p>And then against my heart he sets his sword,</p>
<p>Swearing, unless I took all patiently,</p>
<p>I should not live to speak another word.</p>
<p>So should my shame still rest upon record 1063</p>
<p>And never be forgot in mighty Rome</p>
<p>Th’adulterate 1064 death of Lucrece and her groom.</p>
<p>’Mine enemy was strong, my poor self weak,</p>
<p>And far the weaker with so strong a fear.</p>
<p>My bloody 1065 judge forbade my tongue to speak,</p>
<p>No rightful plea might plead for justice there.</p>
<p>His scarlet 1066 lust came evidence to swear 1067</p>
<p>That my poor beauty had purloined 1068 his eyes,</p>
<p>And when the judge is robbed the prisoner dies.</p>
<p>’O, teach me how to make mine own excuse,</p>
<p>Or at the least this refuge let me find:</p>
<p>Though my gross 1069 blood be stained with this abuse,</p>
<p>Immaculate and spotless is my mind:</p>
<p>That was not forced, that never was inclined</p>
<p>To accessary yieldings 1070 , but still pure</p>
<p>Doth in her poisoned closet 1071 yet endure.’</p>
<p>Lo, here, the hopeless merchant 1072 of this loss,</p>
<p>With head declined 1073 , and voice dammed up with woe,</p>
<p>With sad set eyes and wretched arms across 1074 ,</p>
<p>From lips new-waxen 1075 pale begins to blow</p>
<p>The grief away that stops his answer so.</p>
<p>But, wretched as he is, he strives in vain:</p>
<p>What he breathes out his breath drinks up again 1076 .</p>
<p>As through an arch the violent roaring tide</p>
<p>Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,</p>
<p>Yet in the eddy 1077 boundeth in 1078 his pride</p>
<p>Back to the strait 1079 that forced him on so fast,</p>
<p>In rage sent out, recalled in rage, being past:</p>
<p>Even so his sighs, his sorrows, make a saw 1080 ,</p>
<p>To push grief on and back the same grief draw.</p>
<p>Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth 1081 ,</p>
<p>And his untimely frenzy 1082 thus awaketh:</p>
<p>’Dear lord, thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth</p>
<p>Another power 1083 , no flood by raining slaketh.</p>
<p>My woe too sensible 1084 thy passion maketh</p>
<p>More feeling-painful. Let it then suffice</p>
<p>To drown on 1085 woe, one pair of weeping eyes.</p>
<p>’And for my sake, when I might charm thee so,</p>
<p>For she that was thy Lucrece, now attend 1086 me:</p>
<p>Be suddenly 1087 revengèd on my foe,</p>
<p>Thine, mine, his own 1088 . Suppose thou dost defend me</p>
<p>From what is past. The help that thou shalt lend me</p>
<p>Comes all too late, yet let the traitor die,</p>
<p>For sparing justice feeds iniquity.</p>
<p>‘But ere I name him, you fair lords,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>Speaking to those that came with Collatine,</p>
<p>’Shall plight your honourable faiths 1089 to me,</p>
<p>With swift pursuit to venge 1090 this wrong of mine,</p>
<p>For ’tis a meritorious fair design</p>
<p>To chase injustice with revengeful arms:</p>
<p>Knights, by their oaths, should right poor ladies’ harms.’</p>
<p>At this request, with noble disposition</p>
<p>Each present lord began to promise aid,</p>
<p>As bound in knighthood to her imposition 1091 ,</p>
<p>Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed 1092 .</p>
<p>But she, that yet her sad task hath not said 1093 ,</p>
<p>The protestation 1094 stops. ‘O, speak,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>’How may this forcèd stain be wiped from me?</p>
<p>’What is the quality 1095 of my offence,</p>
<p>Being constrained with dreadful circumstance?</p>
<p>May my pure mind with the foul act dispense 1096 ,</p>
<p>My low-declinèd honour to advance 1097 ?</p>
<p>May any terms 1098 acquit me from this chance 1099 ?</p>
<p>The poisoned fountain clears itself again,</p>
<p>And why not I from this compellèd stain?’</p>
<p>With this, they all at once began to say,</p>
<p>Her body’s stain her mind untainted clears,</p>
<p>While with a joyless smile she turns away</p>
<p>The face, that map which deep impression bears</p>
<p>Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.</p>
<p>‘No, no,’ quoth she, ’no dame, hereafter living,</p>
<p>By my excuse shall claim excuse’s giving 1100 .’</p>
<p>Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,</p>
<p>She throws forth Tarquin’s name. ‘He, he,’ she says,</p>
<p>But more than ‘he’ her poor tongue could not speak,</p>
<p>Till after many accents and delays,</p>
<p>Untimely 1101 breathings, sick and short assays 1102 ,</p>
<p>She utters this, ’He, he, fair lords, ’tis he,</p>
<p>That guides this hand to give this wound to me.’</p>
<p>Even here she sheathèd in her harmless breast</p>
<p>A harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheathed.</p>
<p>That blow did bail 1103 it from the deep unrest</p>
<p>Of that polluted prison 1104 where it breathed.</p>
<p>Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed</p>
<p>Her wingèd sprite 1105 , and through her wounds doth fly</p>
<p>Life’s lasting date from cancelled destiny 1106 .</p>
<p>Stone-still, astonished with this deadly deed,</p>
<p>Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew 1107 ,</p>
<p>Till Lucrece’ father, that beholds her bleed,</p>
<p>Himself on her self-slaughtered body threw,</p>
<p>And from the purple fountain Brutus 1108 drew</p>
<p>The murd’rous knife and, as it left the place,</p>
<p>Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase 1109 ,</p>
<p>And bubbling from her breast, it doth divide</p>
<p>In two slow rivers, that the crimson blood</p>
<p>Circles her body in on every side,</p>
<p>Who, like a late-sacked 1110 island, vastly 1111 stood</p>
<p>Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood.</p>
<p>Some of her blood still pure and red remained,</p>
<p>And some looked black and that false Tarquin stained.</p>
<p>About the mourning and congealèd face</p>
<p>Of that black blood a wat’ry rigol 1112 goes,</p>
<p>Which seems to weep upon the tainted place,</p>
<p>And ever since, as pitying Lucrece’ woes,</p>
<p>Corrupted blood some watery token shows,</p>
<p>And blood untainted still doth red abide,</p>
<p>Blushing at that which is so putrefied.</p>
<p>‘Daughter, dear daughter,’ old Lucretius 1113 cries,</p>
<p>’That life was mine which thou hast here deprived.</p>
<p>If in the child the father’s image lies,</p>
<p>Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived?</p>
<p>Thou wast not to this end from me derived.</p>
<p>If children predecease progenitors 1114 ,</p>
<p>We are their offspring and they none of ours.</p>
<p>’Poor broken glass 1115 , I often did behold</p>
<p>In thy sweet semblance my old age new born,</p>
<p>But now that fair fresh mirror, dim and old,</p>
<p>Shows me a bare-boned death by time outworn.</p>
<p>O, from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn,</p>
<p>And shivered 1116 all the beauty of my glass,</p>
<p>That I no more can see what once I was.</p>
<p>’O time, cease thou thy course and last no longer,</p>
<p>If they surcease 1117 to be that should survive.</p>
<p>Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger</p>
<p>And leave the falt’ring feeble souls alive?</p>
<p>The old bees die, the young possess their hive.</p>
<p>Then live, sweet Lucrece, live again and see</p>
<p>Thy father die and not thy father thee.’</p>
<p>By this, starts Collatine as from a dream</p>
<p>And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place 1118 ,</p>
<p>And then in key-cold 1119 Lucrece’ bleeding stream</p>
<p>He falls and bathes the pale fear in his face,</p>
<p>And counterfeits 1120 to die with her a space,</p>
<p>Till manly shame bids him possess his breath</p>
<p>And live to be revengèd on her death.</p>
<p>The deep vexation 1121 of his inward soul</p>
<p>Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue,</p>
<p>Who, mad that sorrow should his use control,</p>
<p>Or keep him from heart-easing words so long,</p>
<p>Begins to talk, but through his lips do throng</p>
<p>Weak words, so thick come 1122 in his poor heart’s aid,</p>
<p>That no man could distinguish what he said.</p>
<p>Yet sometime ‘Tarquin’ was pronouncèd plain,</p>
<p>But through his teeth, as if the name he tore.</p>
<p>This windy tempest, till it blow up rain,</p>
<p>Held back his sorrow’s tide, to make it more.</p>
<p>At last it rains and busy winds give o’er 1123 .</p>
<p>Then son and father weep with equal strife 1124</p>
<p>Who should weep most, for daughter or for wife.</p>
<p>The one doth call her his, the other his,</p>
<p>Yet neither may possess the claim they lay.</p>
<p>The father says, ‘She’s mine’. ‘O, mine she is,’</p>
<p>Replies her husband. ’Do not take away</p>
<p>My sorrow’s interest 1125 , let no mourner say</p>
<p>He weeps for her, for she was only mine,</p>
<p>And only must be wailed by Collatine.’</p>
<p>‘O,’ quoth Lucretius, ’I did give that life</p>
<p>Which she too early and too late hath spilled.’</p>
<p>‘Woe, woe,’ quoth Collatine, ’she was my wife,</p>
<p>I owed 1126 her and ‘tis mine that she hath killed.’</p>
<p>‘My daughter’ and ‘my wife’ with clamours filled</p>
<p>The dispersed 1127 air, who, holding Lucrece’ life,</p>
<p>Answered their cries, ‘my daughter’ and ‘my wife’.</p>
<p>Brutus 1128 , who plucked the knife from Lucrece’ side,</p>
<p>Seeing such emulation 1129 in their woe,</p>
<p>Began to clothe his wit 1130 in state and pride,</p>
<p>Burying in Lucrece’ wound his folly’s show 1131 .</p>
<p>He with the Romans was esteemèd so</p>
<p>As silly-jeering idiots are with kings,</p>
<p>For sportive words and utt’ring foolish things,</p>
<p>But now he throws that shallow habit 1132 by,</p>
<p>Wherein deep policy 1133 did him disguise,</p>
<p>And armed his long-hid wits advisedly,</p>
<p>To check the tears in Collatinus’ eyes.</p>
<p>‘Thou wrongèd lord of Rome,’ quoth he, ’arise!</p>
<p>Let my unsounded 1134 self, supposed a fool,</p>
<p>Now set thy long-experienced wit to school.</p>
<p>’Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?</p>
<p>Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?</p>
<p>Is it revenge to give thyself a blow</p>
<p>For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds?</p>
<p>Such childish humour 1135 from weak minds proceeds.</p>
<p>Thy wretched 1136 wife mistook the matter so,</p>
<p>To slay herself that should have slain her foe.</p>
<p>’Courageous Roman, do not steep 1137 thy heart</p>
<p>In such relenting 1138 dew of lamentations,</p>
<p>But kneel with me and help to bear thy part</p>
<p>To rouse our Roman gods with invocations 1139 ,</p>
<p>That they will suffer 1140 these abominations —</p>
<p>Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced —</p>
<p>By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased.</p>
<p>’Now, by the Capitol 1141 that we adore,</p>
<p>And by this chaste blood so unjustly stained,</p>
<p>By heaven’s fair sun that breeds the fat 1142 earth’s store,</p>
<p>By all our country rights in Rome maintained,</p>
<p>And by chaste Lucrece’ soul that late complained</p>
<p>Her wrongs to us, and by this bloody knife</p>
<p>We will revenge the death of this true wife.’</p>
<p>This said, he struck his hand upon his breast,</p>
<p>And kissed the fatal knife, to end his vow,</p>
<p>And to his protestation 1143 urged the rest,</p>
<p>Who, wond’ring 1144 at him, did his words allow 1145 .</p>
<p>Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow,</p>
<p>And that deep vow, which Brutus made before,</p>
<p>He doth again repeat and that they swore.</p>
<p>When they had sworn to this advisèd doom 1146 ,</p>
<p>They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence,</p>
<p>To show her bleeding body thorough 1147 Rome,</p>
<p>And so to publish Tarquin’s foul offence;</p>
<p>Which being done with speedy diligence,</p>
<p>The Romans plausibly 1148 did give consent</p>
<p>To Tarquin’s everlasting banishment.</p>

<p>LET the bird of loudest lay 2 3</p>
<p>On the sole Arabian tree</p>
<p>Herald sad and trumpet 4 be,</p>
<p>To whose sound chaste wings obey.</p>
<p>But thou shrieking harbinger 5 ,</p>
<p>Foul precurrer 6 of the fiend 7 ,</p>
<p>Augur 8 of the fever’s end,</p>
<p>To this troop come thou not near.</p>
<p>From this session 9 interdict 10</p>
<p>Every fowl of tyrant wing 11 ,</p>
<p>Save 12 the eagle, feathered king:</p>
<p>Keep the obsequy 13 so strict 14 .</p>
<p>Let the priest in surplice 15 white,</p>
<p>That defunctive 16 music can 17 ,</p>
<p>Be the death-divining 18 swan,</p>
<p>Lest the requiem lack his right 19 .</p>
<p>And thou treble-dated 20 crow,</p>
<p>That thy sable gender 21 mak’st</p>
<p>With the breath thou giv’st and tak’st,</p>
<p>’Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.</p>
<p>Here the anthem 22 doth commence:</p>
<p>Love and constancy is dead;</p>
<p>Phoenix 23 and the turtle 24 fled 25</p>
<p>In a mutual flame 26 from hence.</p>
<p>So they loved, as 27 love in twain 28</p>
<p>Had the essence but in one 29 ,</p>
<p>Two distincts 30 , division none:</p>
<p>Number 31 there in love was slain.</p>
<p>Hearts remote 32 , yet not asunder 33 ;</p>
<p>Distance 34 and no space was seen</p>
<p>’Twixt this turtle and his queen:</p>
<p>But in them it were a wonder 35 .</p>
<p>So between them love did shine</p>
<p>That the turtle saw his right 36</p>
<p>Flaming in the phoenix’ sight 37 :</p>
<p>Either was the other’s mine 38 .</p>
<p>Property 39 was thus appalled</p>
<p>That the self was not the same 40 :</p>
<p>Single nature’s double name</p>
<p>Neither two nor one was called 41 .</p>
<p>Reason, in itself confounded 42 ,</p>
<p>Saw division grow together 43 ,</p>
<p>To themselves yet either neither 44 ,</p>
<p>Simple 45 were so well compounded 46 ,</p>
<p>That it 47 cried, ’How true 48 a twain</p>
<p>Seemeth this concordant 49 one!</p>
<p>Love hath reason, reason none,</p>
<p>If what parts can so remain 50 .’</p>
<p>Whereupon it made this threne 51</p>
<p>To the phoenix and the dove,</p>
<p>Co-supremes 52 and stars of love,</p>
<p>As chorus to their tragic scene.</p>
<p>THRENOS 53</p>
<p>Beauty, truth and rarity,</p>
<p>Grace in all simplicity,</p>
<p>Here enclosed in cinders lie.</p>
<p>Death is now the phoenix’ nest,</p>
<p>And the turtle’s loyal breast</p>
<p>To eternity doth rest,</p>
<p>Leaving no posterity 54 .</p>
<p>’Twas not their infirmity 55 ,</p>
<p>It was married chastity.</p>
<p>Truth may seem but cannot be 56 ,</p>
<p>Beauty brag but ’tis not she,</p>
<p>Truth and beauty buried be.</p>
<p>To this urn let those repair 57</p>
<p>That are either true or fair,</p>
<p>For these dead birds sigh a prayer.</p>
<p>William Shake-speare</p>
<p>The Phoenix: mythical bird that is the only one of its kind,
perpetually regenerating itself from its own ashes, sometimes serving in
the period as an image of Queen Elizabeth, but perhaps also suggesting
the regenerative power of poetic art.</p>

<p>FROM fairest creatures we desire increase 7 ,</p>
<p>That 8 thereby beauty’s rose might never die,</p>
<p>But as the riper should by time decease,</p>
<p>His tender 9 heir might bear his memory 10 :</p>
<p>But thou 11 , contracted 12 to thine own bright eyes 13 ,</p>
<p>Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel 14 ,</p>
<p>Making a famine where abundance lies,</p>
<p>Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.</p>
<p>Thou that art now the world’s fresh 15 ornament</p>
<p>And only herald 16 to the gaudy 17 spring,</p>
<p>Within thine own bud 18 buriest thy content 19</p>
<p>And, tender churl 20 , mak’st waste 21 in niggarding 22 .</p>
<p>Pity the world, or else this glutton be,</p>
<p>To eat the world’s due 23 , by the grave and thee 24 .</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>When forty 25 winters shall besiege thy brow</p>
<p>And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field 26 ,</p>
<p>Thy youth’s proud livery 27 , so gazed on now,</p>
<p>Will be a tattered weed 28 of small worth held:</p>
<p>Then being asked where all thy beauty lies,</p>
<p>Where all the treasure 29 of thy lusty 30 days,</p>
<p>To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes</p>
<p>Were an all-eating shame 31 and thriftless 32 praise.</p>
<p>How much more praise deserved thy beauty’s use 33</p>
<p>If thou couldst answer 34 , ’This fair child of mine</p>
<p>Shall sum my count 35 and make my old excuse 36 ’,</p>
<p>Proving his beauty by succession 37 thine 38 .</p>
<p>This were 39 to be new made when thou art old</p>
<p>And see thy blood 40 warm when thou feel’st it cold.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Look in thy glass 41 and tell the face thou viewest</p>
<p>Now is the time that face should form another,</p>
<p>Whose fresh repair 42 if now thou not renewest</p>
<p>Thou dost beguile 43 the world, unbless some mother 44 .</p>
<p>For where is she so fair whose uneared 45 womb</p>
<p>Disdains the tillage 46 of thy husbandry 47 ?</p>
<p>Or who is he so fond 48 will be 49 the tomb</p>
<p>Of his self-love, to stop 50 posterity 51 ?</p>
<p>Thou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee</p>
<p>Calls back 52 the lovely April of her prime:</p>
<p>So thou through windows 53 of thine age shalt see,</p>
<p>Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.</p>
<p>But if thou live remembered not to be 54 ,</p>
<p>Die 55 single and thine image dies with thee.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Unthrifty 56 loveliness, why dost thou spend 57</p>
<p>Upon thyself thy beauty’s legacy 58 ?</p>
<p>Nature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,</p>
<p>And being frank 59 she lends to those 60 are free 61 .</p>
<p>Then, beauteous niggard 62 , why dost thou abuse</p>
<p>The bounteous largesse given thee to give?</p>
<p>Profitless usurer 63 , why dost thou use 64</p>
<p>So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live 65 ?</p>
<p>For having traffic 66 with thyself alone,</p>
<p>Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive 67 .</p>
<p>Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,</p>
<p>What acceptable audit 68 canst thou leave?</p>
<p>Thy unused 69 beauty must be tombed 70 with thee,</p>
<p>Which, usèd, lives th’executor 71 to be.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Those hours, that with gentle work did frame 72</p>
<p>The lovely gaze 73 where every eye doth dwell 74 ,</p>
<p>Will play the tyrants to the very same</p>
<p>And that unfair 75 which fairly 76 doth excel:</p>
<p>For never-resting time leads 77 summer on</p>
<p>To hideous winter and confounds 78 him there,</p>
<p>Sap checked 79 with frost and lusty 80 leaves quite gone,</p>
<p>Beauty o’ersnowed 81 and bareness everywhere.</p>
<p>Then, were not summer’s distillation 82 left</p>
<p>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass 83 ,</p>
<p>Beauty’s effect with 84 beauty were bereft 85 ,</p>
<p>Nor it nor no remembrance what it was 86 .</p>
<p>But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,</p>
<p>Lose but their show 87 , their substance still 88 lives sweet.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Then let not winter’s ragged 89 hand deface</p>
<p>In thee thy summer, ere thou be distilled 90 :</p>
<p>Make sweet some vial 91 ; treasure 92 thou some place 93</p>
<p>With beauty’s treasure, ere it be self-killed 94 .</p>
<p>That use 95 is not forbidden usury,</p>
<p>Which happies 96 those that pay the willing loan 97 ;</p>
<p>That’s for thyself to breed another thee,</p>
<p>Or ten times happier be it ten for one 98 .</p>
<p>Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,</p>
<p>If ten of thine ten times refigured 99 thee.</p>
<p>Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,</p>
<p>Leaving thee living in posterity 100 ?</p>
<p>Be not self-willed 101 , for thou art much too fair 102</p>
<p>To be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Lo, in the orient 103 when the gracious light 104</p>
<p>Lifts up his burning head, each under 105 eye</p>
<p>Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,</p>
<p>Serving with looks his sacred majesty.</p>
<p>And having climbed the steep-up 106 heavenly hill 107 ,</p>
<p>Resembling strong youth in his middle age,</p>
<p>Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,</p>
<p>Attending on his golden pilgrimage.</p>
<p>But when from highmost pitch 108 , with weary car 109 ,</p>
<p>Like feeble age he reeleth 110 from the day,</p>
<p>The eyes, fore 111 duteous, now converted 112 are</p>
<p>From his low tract 113 and look another way:</p>
<p>So thou, thyself outgoing 114 in thy noon 115 ,</p>
<p>Unlooked on diest 116 unless thou get 117 a son 118 .</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Music to hear 119 , why hear’st thou music sadly 120 ?</p>
<p>Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.</p>
<p>Why lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly,</p>
<p>Or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy 121 ?</p>
<p>If the true concord of well-tunèd sounds,</p>
<p>By unions 122 married, do offend thine ear,</p>
<p>They do but sweetly chide 123 thee, who confounds 124</p>
<p>In singleness 125 the parts that thou shouldst bear 126 .</p>
<p>Mark 127 how one string, sweet husband to another,</p>
<p>Strikes each in each 128 by mutual ordering,</p>
<p>Resembling sire 129 and child and happy mother</p>
<p>Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing,</p>
<p>Whose speechless 130 song, being many, seeming one,</p>
<p>Sings this to thee: ‘Thou single wilt prove none.’ 131</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Is it for fear to wet a widow’s eye</p>
<p>That thou consum’st thyself in single life?</p>
<p>Ah, if thou issueless 132 shalt hap 133 to die,</p>
<p>The world will wail thee, like a makeless 134 wife,</p>
<p>The world will be thy widow and still 135 weep</p>
<p>That thou no form 136 of thee hast left behind,</p>
<p>When every private 137 widow well may keep</p>
<p>By 138 children’s eyes her husband’s shape in mind.</p>
<p>Look what 139 an unthrift 140 in the world doth spend</p>
<p>Shifts but his 141 place, for still the world enjoys it 142 ,</p>
<p>But beauty’s waste 143 hath in the world an end,</p>
<p>And, kept unused 144 , the user 145 so destroys it.</p>
<p>No love toward others in that bosom 146 sits</p>
<p>That on himself such murd’rous shame 147 commits.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>For shame 148 deny that thou bear’st 149 love to any,</p>
<p>Who for thyself art so unprovident 150 .</p>
<p>Grant 151 , if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,</p>
<p>But that thou none lov’st is most evident:</p>
<p>For thou art so possessed with murd’rous hate</p>
<p>That gainst thyself thou stick’st 152 not to conspire,</p>
<p>Seeking that beauteous roof 153 to ruinate</p>
<p>Which to repair should be thy chief desire.</p>
<p>O, change thy thought 154 , that I may change my mind 155 .</p>
<p>Shall hate be fairer lodged 156 than gentle love?</p>
<p>Be as thy presence 157 is, gracious and kind 158 ,</p>
<p>Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove.</p>
<p>Make thee another self 159 , for love of me,</p>
<p>That beauty still 160 may live in thine or thee 161 .</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>As fast as thou shalt wane 162 , so fast thou grow’st</p>
<p>In one of thine 163 , from that which thou departest 164 ,</p>
<p>And that fresh blood 165 which youngly 166 thou bestow’st,</p>
<p>Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest 167 168 .</p>
<p>Herein 169 lives wisdom, beauty and increase 170 :</p>
<p>Without this, folly, age and cold decay.</p>
<p>If all were minded so 171 , the times should cease,</p>
<p>And threescore year 172 would make the world away 173 .</p>
<p>Let those whom nature hath not made for store 174 ,</p>
<p>Harsh, featureless 175 and rude 176 , barrenly perish.</p>
<p>Look whom 177 she best endowed she gave the more,</p>
<p>Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty 178 cherish.</p>
<p>She carved thee for her seal 179 , and meant thereby</p>
<p>Thou shouldst print 180 more, not let that copy 181 die.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>When I do count 182 the clock that tells 183 the time</p>
<p>And see the brave 184 day sunk in hideous night,</p>
<p>When I behold the violet past prime 185</p>
<p>And sable 186 curls all silvered o’er with white,</p>
<p>When lofty trees I see barren 187 of leaves,</p>
<p>Which erst 188 from heat did canopy 189 the herd,</p>
<p>And summer’s green all girded up 190 in sheaves</p>
<p>Borne on the bier 191 with white and bristly beard 192 :</p>
<p>Then of thy beauty do I question make 193</p>
<p>That thou among the wastes 194 of time must go,</p>
<p>Since sweets and beauties 195 do themselves forsake 196</p>
<p>And die as fast as they see others grow,</p>
<p>And nothing gainst Time’s scythe 197 can make defence</p>
<p>Save breed 198 , to brave 199 him when he takes thee hence.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>O, that you 200 were yourself! But, love, you are</p>
<p>No longer yours than you yourself here 201 live.</p>
<p>Against 202 this coming end you should prepare</p>
<p>And your sweet semblance 203 to some other 204 give.</p>
<p>So should that beauty which you hold in lease 205</p>
<p>Find no determination 206 : then you were 207</p>
<p>Yourself again after yourself’s decease,</p>
<p>When your sweet issue 208 your sweet form should bear 209 .</p>
<p>Who lets so fair a house 210 fall to decay,</p>
<p>Which husbandry 211 in honour might uphold</p>
<p>Against the stormy gusts of winter’s day</p>
<p>And barren rage of death’s eternal cold?</p>
<p>O, none but unthrifts 212 ! Dear my love, you know</p>
<p>You had a father: let your son say so.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck 213</p>
<p>And yet methinks I have 214 astronomy,</p>
<p>But not to tell of good or evil luck,</p>
<p>Of plagues, of dearths 215 , or seasons’ quality 216 ,</p>
<p>Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell 217 ,</p>
<p>Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,</p>
<p>Or say with princes if it shall go well,</p>
<p>By oft predict 218 that I in heaven find.</p>
<p>But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,</p>
<p>And, constant stars, in them I read such art 219</p>
<p>As 220 truth and beauty shall together thrive,</p>
<p>If from thyself to store 221 thou wouldst convert 222 :</p>
<p>Or else of thee this I prognosticate 223 ,</p>
<p>Thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom and date 224 225 .</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>When I consider 226 everything that grows</p>
<p>Holds in perfection 227 but a little moment,</p>
<p>That this huge stage 228 presenteth nought but shows</p>
<p>Whereon the stars in secret influence 229 comment 230 :</p>
<p>When I perceive that men as 231 plants increase,</p>
<p>Cheerèd and checked 232 ev’n by the selfsame sky,</p>
<p>Vaunt 233 in their youthful sap, at height decrease 234 ,</p>
<p>And wear their brave state out of memory 235 :</p>
<p>Then the conceit 236 of this inconstant stay 237</p>
<p>Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,</p>
<p>Where wasteful 238 time debateth with decay 239</p>
<p>To change your day of youth to sullied 240 night,</p>
<p>And all in war 241 with Time for love of you,</p>
<p>As he takes from you, I engraft you new 242 .</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>But wherefore 243 do not you a mightier way</p>
<p>Make war upon this bloody 244 tyrant, Time?</p>
<p>And fortify 245 yourself in your decay</p>
<p>With means more blessèd than my barren rhyme?</p>
<p>Now stand you on the top of happy hours 246 ,</p>
<p>And many maiden 247 gardens 248 , yet unset 249 ,</p>
<p>With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,</p>
<p>Much liker 250 than your painted counterfeit 251 :</p>
<p>So should the lines of life 252 that life repair 253 ,</p>
<p>Which this 254 , Time’s pencil 255 , or my pupil 256 pen,</p>
<p>Neither in inward worth nor outward fair 257 ,</p>
<p>Can make you live yourself 258 in eyes of men.</p>
<p>To give away yourself 259 keeps yourself still 260 ,</p>
<p>And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill 261 .</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Who will believe my verse in time to come</p>
<p>If it were filled with your most high deserts 262 ?</p>
<p>Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb</p>
<p>Which hides your life and shows not half your parts 263 .</p>
<p>If I could write the beauty of your eyes</p>
<p>And in fresh number 264 s number all your graces,</p>
<p>The age to come would say, ’This poet lies:</p>
<p>Such heavenly touches 265 ne’er touched earthly faces.’</p>
<p>So should my papers, yellowed with their age,</p>
<p>Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue 266 ,</p>
<p>And your true 267 rights 268 be termed a poet’s rage 269</p>
<p>And stretchèd 270 metre of an antique 271 song.</p>
<p>But were some child of yours alive that time,</p>
<p>You should live twice — in it and in my rhyme.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</p>
<p>Thou art more lovely and more temperate 272 .</p>
<p>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</p>
<p>And summer’s lease 273 hath all too short a date 274 .</p>
<p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven 275 shines,</p>
<p>And often is his gold complexion dimmed,</p>
<p>And every fair from fair sometime declines 276 ,</p>
<p>By chance or nature’s changing course untrimmed 277 :</p>
<p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade</p>
<p>Nor lose possession 278 of that fair thou ow’st 279 ,</p>
<p>Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,</p>
<p>When in eternal lines 280 to time thou grow’st 281 .</p>
<p>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</p>
<p>So long lives this 282 and this gives life to thee.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion’s paws,</p>
<p>And make the earth devour her own sweet brood 283 ,</p>
<p>Pluck the keen 284 teeth from the fierce tiger’s jaws</p>
<p>And burn the long-lived phoenix 285 in her blood,</p>
<p>Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet’st 286</p>
<p>And do whate’er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,</p>
<p>To the wide world and all her fading sweets 287 .</p>
<p>But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:</p>
<p>O, carve 288 not with thy hours my love’s fair brow,</p>
<p>Nor draw no lines there with thine antique 289 pen.</p>
<p>Him in thy course untainted 290 do allow</p>
<p>For beauty’s pattern 291 to succeeding men.</p>
<p>Yet do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,</p>
<p>My love 292 shall in my verse ever live young.</p>
<p>20 293</p>
<p>A woman’s face with Nature’s own hand painted 294</p>
<p>Hast thou, the master-mistress 295 of my passion 296 ,</p>
<p>A woman’s gentle heart, but not acquainted 297</p>
<p>With shifting change as is false 298 women’s fashion,</p>
<p>An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling 299 ,</p>
<p>Gilding 300 the object whereupon it gazeth:</p>
<p>A man in hue 301 , all hues in his controlling 302 ,</p>
<p>Which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.</p>
<p>And for 303 a woman wert thou first created,</p>
<p>Till Nature as she wrought 304 thee fell a-doting 305 ,</p>
<p>And by addition me of thee defeated 306</p>
<p>By adding one thing 307 to my purpose nothing 308 .</p>
<p>But since she pricked thee out 309 for women’s pleasure 310 ,</p>
<p>Mine be thy love and thy love’s use 311 their treasure 312 313 .</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>So is it not with me as with that Muse 314 ,</p>
<p>Stirred 315 by a painted 316 beauty to his verse,</p>
<p>Who heaven itself for ornament doth use 317</p>
<p>And every fair with his fair doth rehearse 318 ,</p>
<p>Making a couplement of proud compare 319</p>
<p>With sun and moon, with earth and sea’s rich gems,</p>
<p>With April’s first-born flowers and all things rare 320</p>
<p>That heaven’s air in this huge rondure 321 hems 322 .</p>
<p>O let me, true in love, but truly write,</p>
<p>And then believe me, my love is as fair</p>
<p>As any mother’s child 323 , though not so bright</p>
<p>As those gold candles 324 fixed in heaven’s air.</p>
<p>Let them say more that like of hearsay 325 well:</p>
<p>I will not praise that purpose 326 not to sell.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>My glass 327 shall not persuade me I am old,</p>
<p>So long as youth and thou are of one date 328 ,</p>
<p>But when in thee time’s furrows 329 I behold,</p>
<p>Then look I 330 death my days should expiate 331 .</p>
<p>For all that beauty that doth cover thee</p>
<p>Is but the seemly raiment 332 of my heart,</p>
<p>Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me 333 :</p>
<p>How can I then be elder than thou art?</p>
<p>O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary 334</p>
<p>As I, not for myself, but for thee will,</p>
<p>Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary 335</p>
<p>As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.</p>
<p>Presume not on thy heart 336 when mine is slain:</p>
<p>Thou gav’st me thine, not to give back again.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>As an unperfect 337 actor on the stage,</p>
<p>Who with his fear is put besides his part 338 ,</p>
<p>Or some fierce thing replete 339 with too much rage,</p>
<p>Whose strength’s abundance weakens his own heart,</p>
<p>So I, for fear of trust 340 , forget to say</p>
<p>The perfect ceremony of love’s rite 341 ,</p>
<p>And in mine own love’s strength seem to decay,</p>
<p>O’ercharged 342 with burden of mine own love’s might 343 .</p>
<p>O, let my books 344 be then the eloquence</p>
<p>And dumb presagers 345 of my speaking breast 346 ,</p>
<p>Who 347 plead for love and look for recompense,</p>
<p>More than that tongue 348 that more hath more expressed.</p>
<p>O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:</p>
<p>To hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit 349 .</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled 350</p>
<p>Thy beauty’s form in table 351 of my heart,</p>
<p>My body is the frame 352 wherein ’tis held</p>
<p>And perspective 353 it is best painter’s art.</p>
<p>For through 354 the painter must you see his skill</p>
<p>To find where your true image pictured lies,</p>
<p>Which in my bosom’s shop 355 is hanging still 356 ,</p>
<p>That hath his windows glazèd with thine eyes 357 .</p>
<p>Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:</p>
<p>Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me</p>
<p>Are windows to my breast, wherethrough the sun</p>
<p>Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee.</p>
<p>Yet eyes this cunning want 358 to grace their art:</p>
<p>They draw but what they see, know 359 not the heart.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Let those who are in favour with their stars</p>
<p>Of 360 public honour and proud titles boast,</p>
<p>Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph 361 bars,</p>
<p>Unlooked for 362 joy in that I honour most 363 .</p>
<p>Great princes’ favourites their fair leaves 364 spread</p>
<p>But as the marigold 365 at the sun’s eye,</p>
<p>And in themselves their pride lies burièd 366 ,</p>
<p>For at a frown they in their glory 367 die.</p>
<p>The painful 368 warrior famousèd 369 for might 370 ,</p>
<p>After a thousand victories once foiled 371 ,</p>
<p>Is from the book of honour razèd 372 quite</p>
<p>And all the rest forgot for which he toiled.</p>
<p>Then happy I, that love and am beloved</p>
<p>Where I may not remove 373 nor be removed.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage 374</p>
<p>Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit 375 ,</p>
<p>To thee I send this written ambassage 376</p>
<p>To witness 377 duty, not to show my wit 378 .</p>
<p>Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine</p>
<p>May make seem bare, in wanting 379 words to show it,</p>
<p>But that I hope some good conceit of thine</p>
<p>In thy soul’s thought, all naked, will bestow it 380 ,</p>
<p>Till whatsoever star that guides my moving 381</p>
<p>Points on me graciously with fair aspect 382</p>
<p>And puts apparel on my tattered loving</p>
<p>To show me worthy of thy sweet respect.</p>
<p>Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee:</p>
<p>Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me 383 .</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,</p>
<p>The dear 384 repose for limbs with travel 385 tired,</p>
<p>But then begins a journey in my head,</p>
<p>To work my mind, when body’s work’s expired:</p>
<p>For then my thoughts, from far 386 where I abide,</p>
<p>Intend 387 a zealous pilgrimage to thee,</p>
<p>And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,</p>
<p>Looking on darkness which the blind do see,</p>
<p>Save that my soul’s imaginary sight</p>
<p>Presents thy shadow 388 to my sightless view,</p>
<p>Which 389 , like a jewel hung in ghastly 390 night,</p>
<p>Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.</p>
<p>Lo, thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,</p>
<p>For 391 thee and for myself no quiet find.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>How can I then 392 return in happy plight 393</p>
<p>That am debarred the benefit of rest,</p>
<p>When day’s oppression 394 is not eased by night,</p>
<p>But day by night and night by day oppressed?</p>
<p>And each, though enemies to either’s reign,</p>
<p>Do in consent shake hands 395 to torture me,</p>
<p>The one by toil, the other to complain 396</p>
<p>How far I toil, still further off from thee.</p>
<p>I tell the day, to please him thou art bright</p>
<p>And dost him grace 397 when clouds do blot the heaven:</p>
<p>So flatter I the swart-complexioned 398 night,</p>
<p>When sparkling stars twire 399 not thou gild’st the even 400 .</p>
<p>But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,</p>
<p>And night doth nightly make grief’s length seem stronger.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>When in disgrace 401 with Fortune and men’s eyes,</p>
<p>I all alone beweep 402 my outcast state</p>
<p>And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless 403 cries</p>
<p>And look upon myself and curse my fate,</p>
<p>Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</p>
<p>Featured like him, like him with friends possessed 404 ,</p>
<p>Desiring this man’s art 405 and that man’s scope 406 ,</p>
<p>With what I most enjoy contented least 407 :</p>
<p>Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,</p>
<p>Haply 408 I think on thee and then my state 409 ,</p>
<p>Like to the lark at break of day arising,</p>
<p>From sullen 410 earth sings hymns at heaven’s gate,</p>
<p>For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings</p>
<p>That then I scorn to change 411 my state with kings.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>When to the sessions of sweet silent thought</p>
<p>I summon 412 up remembrance of things past,</p>
<p>I sigh 413 the lack of many a thing I sought</p>
<p>And with old woes new wail 414 my dear 415 time’s waste.</p>
<p>Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow 416 ,</p>
<p>For precious friends hid in death’s dateless 417 night,</p>
<p>And weep afresh love’s long since cancelled 418 woe,</p>
<p>And moan th’expense 419 of many a vanished sight.</p>
<p>Then can I grieve at grievances foregone 420 ,</p>
<p>And heavily 421 from woe to woe tell o’er 422</p>
<p>The sad account 423 of fore-bemoanèd moan 424 ,</p>
<p>Which I new pay as if not paid before.</p>
<p>But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,</p>
<p>All losses are restored and sorrows end.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Thy bosom 425 is endearèd with 426 all hearts,</p>
<p>Which I by lacking 427 have supposèd dead 428 ,</p>
<p>And there reigns love and all love’s loving parts 429</p>
<p>And all those friends which I thought burièd.</p>
<p>How many a holy and obsequious 430 tear</p>
<p>Hath dear 431 religious 432 love stol’n from mine eye</p>
<p>As interest 433 of the dead, which now appear</p>
<p>But things removed 434 that hidden in there 435 lie.</p>
<p>Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,</p>
<p>Hung with the trophies 436 of my lovers gone,</p>
<p>Who all their parts of me to thee did give 437 :</p>
<p>That due of 438 many now is thine alone.</p>
<p>Their images I loved 439 I view in thee,</p>
<p>And thou, all they, hast all the all of me 440 .</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>If thou survive my well-contented day 441 ,</p>
<p>When that churl 442 death my bones with dust shall cover,</p>
<p>And shalt by fortune 443 once more resurvey</p>
<p>These poor rude 444 lines of thy deceasèd lover,</p>
<p>Compare them with the bett’ring of the time 445 ,</p>
<p>And though they be outstripped by every pen,</p>
<p>Reserve 446 them for my love, not for their rhyme 447 ,</p>
<p>Exceeded by the height 448 of happier 449 men.</p>
<p>O, then vouchsafe 450 me but this loving thought:</p>
<p>’Had my friend’s Muse 451 grown with this growing age,</p>
<p>A dearer birth 452 than this his love had brought</p>
<p>To march in ranks of better equipage 453 ,</p>
<p>But since he died and poets better prove,</p>
<p>Theirs for their style I’ll read, his for his love.’</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Full many a glorious morning have I seen</p>
<p>Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,</p>
<p>Kissing with golden face the meadows green,</p>
<p>Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy 454 ,</p>
<p>Anon 455 permit the basest 456 clouds to ride</p>
<p>With ugly rack 457 on his celestial face,</p>
<p>And from the forlorn world his visage 458 hide,</p>
<p>Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:</p>
<p>Even so my sun one early morn did shine</p>
<p>With all-triumphant 459 splendour on my brow:</p>
<p>But out, alack 460 , he was but one hour mine,</p>
<p>The region cloud 461 hath masked him from me now.</p>
<p>Yet him for this my love no whit 462 disdaineth:</p>
<p>Suns of the world 463 may stain 464 when heaven’s sun staineth.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Why didst thou 465 promise such a beauteous day</p>
<p>And make me travel forth without my cloak,</p>
<p>To let base clouds o’ertake me in my way,</p>
<p>Hiding thy brav’ry 466 in their rotten smoke 467 ?</p>
<p>’Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break</p>
<p>To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,</p>
<p>For no man well of such a salve 468 can speak</p>
<p>That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace 469 .</p>
<p>Nor can thy shame give physic 470 to my grief:</p>
<p>Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss.</p>
<p>Th’offender’s sorrow lends but weak relief</p>
<p>To him that bears the strong offence’s cross 471 .</p>
<p>Ah, but those tears are pearl, which thy love sheds,</p>
<p>And they are rich and ransom 472 all ill deeds.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:</p>
<p>Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud,</p>
<p>Clouds and eclipses stain 473 both moon and sun,</p>
<p>And loathsome canker 474 lives in sweetest bud.</p>
<p>All men make faults and even I in this,</p>
<p>Authorizing thy trespass with compare 475 ,</p>
<p>Myself corrupting 476 , salving 477 thy amiss 478 ,</p>
<p>Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are 479 :</p>
<p>For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense 480 —</p>
<p>Thy adverse party is thy advocate 481 —</p>
<p>And gainst myself a lawful plea commence 482 .</p>
<p>Such civil war is in my love and hate</p>
<p>That I an accessory 483 needs must be</p>
<p>To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>Let me confess that we two must be twain 484 ,</p>
<p>Although our undivided loves are one:</p>
<p>So shall those blots 485 that do with me remain,</p>
<p>Without thy help by me be borne alone.</p>
<p>In our two loves there is but one respect 486 ,</p>
<p>Though in our lives a separable spite 487 ,</p>
<p>Which though it alter not love’s sole 488 effect,</p>
<p>Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love’s delight.</p>
<p>I may not evermore acknowledge thee 489 ,</p>
<p>Lest my bewailèd guilt 490 should do thee shame,</p>
<p>Nor thou with public kindness honour me,</p>
<p>Unless thou take that honour from thy name 491 .</p>
<p>But do not so: I love thee in such sort 492</p>
<p>As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report 493 .</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>As a decrepit father takes delight</p>
<p>To see his active child do deeds of youth,</p>
<p>So I, made lame by Fortune’s dearest spite 494 ,</p>
<p>Take all my comfort of 495 thy worth and truth.</p>
<p>For whether beauty, birth or wealth or wit 496 ,</p>
<p>Or any of these all or all or more,</p>
<p>Entitled in thy parts do crownèd sit 497 ,</p>
<p>I make my love engrafted to this store 498 :</p>
<p>So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,</p>
<p>Whilst that this shadow 499 doth such substance give</p>
<p>That I in thy abundance am sufficed 500</p>
<p>And by a part of all thy glory live.</p>
<p>Look what 501 is best, that best I wish in thee.</p>
<p>This wish I have: then ten times happy me.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>How can my Muse 502 want subject to invent 503 ,</p>
<p>While thou dost breathe, that pour’st into my verse</p>
<p>Thine own sweet argument 504 , too excellent</p>
<p>For every vulgar paper to rehearse 505 ?</p>
<p>O, give thyself the thanks, if aught 506 in me</p>
<p>Worthy perusal 507 stand against thy sight 508 ,</p>
<p>For who’s so dumb 509 that cannot write to thee,</p>
<p>When thou thyself dost give invention light 510 ?</p>
<p>Be thou the tenth Muse 511 , ten times more in worth</p>
<p>Than those old nine which rhymers invocate 512 ,</p>
<p>And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth</p>
<p>Eternal numbers to outlive long date 513 .</p>
<p>If my slight Muse 514 do please these curious 515 days,</p>
<p>The pain 516 be mine, but thine shall be the praise.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>O, how thy worth 517 with manners 518 may I sing,</p>
<p>When thou art all the better part of me?</p>
<p>What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?</p>
<p>And what is’t but mine own when I praise thee?</p>
<p>Even for 519 this let us divided live,</p>
<p>And our dear 520 love lose name of single one,</p>
<p>That 521 by this separation I may give</p>
<p>That due to thee which thou deserv’st alone.</p>
<p>O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,</p>
<p>Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave</p>
<p>To entertain 522 the time with thoughts of love,</p>
<p>Which time and thoughts so sweetly dost deceive 523 ,</p>
<p>And that thou teachest how to make one twain 524</p>
<p>By praising him here 525 who doth hence 526 remain.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>Take 527 all my loves 528 , my love, yea, take them all:</p>
<p>What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?</p>
<p>No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call:</p>
<p>All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.</p>
<p>Then if for my love 529 thou my love receivest 530 ,</p>
<p>I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest 531 .</p>
<p>But yet be blamed, if thou this self 532 deceivest</p>
<p>By wilful taste 533 of what thyself refusest 534 .</p>
<p>I do forgive thy robb’ry, gentle thief,</p>
<p>Although thou steal thee 535 all my poverty 536 :</p>
<p>And yet love knows it is a greater grief</p>
<p>To bear love’s wrong 537 than hate’s known injury.</p>
<p>Lascivious grace 538 , in whom all ill well shows 539 ,</p>
<p>Kill me with spites 540 , yet we must not be foes.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>Those pretty wrongs that liberty 541 commits</p>
<p>When I am sometime absent from thy heart,</p>
<p>Thy beauty and thy years full well befits 542 ,</p>
<p>For still 543 temptation follows where thou art.</p>
<p>Gentle 544 thou art and therefore to be won,</p>
<p>Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed 545 .</p>
<p>And when a woman woos, what woman’s son</p>
<p>Will sourly 546 leave her till he have prevailed 547 ?</p>
<p>Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat 548 forbear 549</p>
<p>And chide 550 thy beauty and thy straying 551 youth,</p>
<p>Who lead thee in their riot 552 even there 553</p>
<p>Where thou art forced to break a two-fold truth 554 :</p>
<p>Hers 555 by thy beauty tempting her to thee,</p>
<p>Thine 556 by thy beauty being false 557 to me.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,</p>
<p>And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,</p>
<p>That she hath thee is of my wailing chief 558 ,</p>
<p>A loss in love that touches me more nearly.</p>
<p>Loving offenders 559 , thus I will excuse ye:</p>
<p>Thou dost love her, because thou knowst I love her,</p>
<p>And for my sake even so 560 doth she abuse 561 me,</p>
<p>Suff’ring 562 my friend for my sake to approve 563 her.</p>
<p>If I lose thee, my loss is my love’s 564 gain,</p>
<p>And losing her, my friend hath found that loss:</p>
<p>Both find each other and I lose both twain 565 ,</p>
<p>And both for my sake lay on me this cross 566 .</p>
<p>But here’s the joy: my friend and I are one.</p>
<p>Sweet flatt’ry 567 ! Then she loves but me alone.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>When most I wink 568 , then do mine eyes best see,</p>
<p>For all the day they view things unrespected 569 ,</p>
<p>But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee</p>
<p>And, darkly bright, are bright in dark directed 570 .</p>
<p>Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright 571 ,</p>
<p>How would thy shadow’s form form happy show 572</p>
<p>To the clear day with thy much clearer light,</p>
<p>When to unseeing eyes thy shade 573 shines so?</p>
<p>How would, I say, mine eyes be blessèd made</p>
<p>By looking on thee in the living 574 day,</p>
<p>When in dead night thy fair imperfect 575 shade</p>
<p>Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay?</p>
<p>All days are nights to see 576 till I see thee,</p>
<p>And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>If the dull 577 substance of my flesh were thought,</p>
<p>Injurious 578 distance should not stop my way,</p>
<p>For then despite 579 of space I would be brought,</p>
<p>From limits 580 far remote, where 581 thou dost stay.</p>
<p>No matter 582 then, although my foot did stand</p>
<p>Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,</p>
<p>For nimble thought can jump both sea and land</p>
<p>As soon as think the place where he would be.</p>
<p>But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought,</p>
<p>To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,</p>
<p>But that so much of earth and water wrought 583 ,</p>
<p>I must attend time’s leisure 584 with my moan,</p>
<p>Receiving naught by elements so slow</p>
<p>But heavy 585 tears, badges of either’s woe 586 .</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>The other two 587 , slight 588 air and purging 589 fire,</p>
<p>Are both with thee, wherever I abide:</p>
<p>The first 590 my thought, the other 591 my desire,</p>
<p>These present-absent 592 with swift motion slide.</p>
<p>For when these quicker 593 elements are gone</p>
<p>In tender embassy 594 of love to thee,</p>
<p>My life, being made of four, with two alone 595</p>
<p>Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy 596 ,</p>
<p>Until life’s composition be recured 597</p>
<p>By those swift messengers returned from thee,</p>
<p>Who even but now 598 come back again, assured</p>
<p>Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.</p>
<p>This told, I joy 599 — but then no longer glad,</p>
<p>I send them back again and straight 600 grow sad.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>Mine eye and heart are at a mortal 601 war</p>
<p>How to divide the conquest of thy sight 602 :</p>
<p>Mine eye my heart thy picture’s sight would bar 603 ,</p>
<p>My heart mine eye the freedom of that right 604 .</p>
<p>My heart doth plead 605 that thou in him dost lie —</p>
<p>A closet 606 never pierced with crystal eyes —</p>
<p>But the defendant 607 doth that plea deny</p>
<p>And says in him thy fair appearance lies.</p>
<p>To ’cide 608 this title 609 is empannellèd 610</p>
<p>A quest 611 of thoughts, all tenants 612 to the heart,</p>
<p>And by their verdict is determinèd 613</p>
<p>The clear eye’s moiety 614 and the dear heart’s part,</p>
<p>As thus 615 : mine eye’s due is thy outward part 616 ,</p>
<p>And my heart’s right thy inward love of heart.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>Betwixt mine eye and heart a league 617 is took,</p>
<p>And each doth good turns now unto the other:</p>
<p>When that 618 mine eye is famished for a look,</p>
<p>Or heart 619 in love with sighs himself 620 doth smother,</p>
<p>With 621 my love’s picture then my eye doth feast</p>
<p>And to the painted banquet bids 622 my heart.</p>
<p>Another time mine eye is my heart’s guest</p>
<p>And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.</p>
<p>So, either by thy picture or my love,</p>
<p>Thyself away are present still 623 with me,</p>
<p>For thou not further than my thoughts canst move,</p>
<p>And I am still with them and they with thee.</p>
<p>Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight</p>
<p>Awakes my heart to heart’s and eye’s delight.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>How careful was I, when I took my way 624 ,</p>
<p>Each trifle under truest bars 625 to thrust,</p>
<p>That to my use 626 it might unusèd stay</p>
<p>From hands of falsehood 627 , in sure 628 wards 629 of trust.</p>
<p>But thou, to whom 630 my jewels trifles are,</p>
<p>Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,</p>
<p>Thou, best of dearest and mine only care 631 ,</p>
<p>Art left the prey of every vulgar 632 thief.</p>
<p>Thee have I not locked up in any chest,</p>
<p>Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,</p>
<p>Within the gentle closure 633 of my breast,</p>
<p>From whence at pleasure 634 thou mayst come and part:</p>
<p>And even thence thou wilt be stol’n, I fear,</p>
<p>For truth 635 proves thievish for a prize so dear 636 .</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Against 637 that time, if ever that time come,</p>
<p>When I shall see thee frown on my defects,</p>
<p>When as 638 thy love hath cast his utmost sum 639 ,</p>
<p>Called to that audit by advised respects 640 —</p>
<p>Against that time when thou shalt strangely 641 pass</p>
<p>And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,</p>
<p>When love, converted 642 from the thing it was,</p>
<p>Shall reasons find of settled gravity 643 —</p>
<p>Against that time do I ensconce me 644 here</p>
<p>Within the knowledge of mine own desert 645 ,</p>
<p>And this my hand against myself uprear 646</p>
<p>To guard 647 the lawful reasons on thy part:</p>
<p>To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws 648 ,</p>
<p>Since why to love I can allege no cause 649 650 .</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>How heavy 651 do I journey on the way,</p>
<p>When what I seek, my weary travel’s end,</p>
<p>Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,</p>
<p>‘Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend 652 .’</p>
<p>The beast 653 that bears me, tirèd with my woe,</p>
<p>Plods dully 654 on, to bear that weight in me,</p>
<p>As if by some instinct the wretch 655 did know</p>
<p>His rider loved not speed, being made 656 from thee:</p>
<p>The bloody spur cannot provoke him on</p>
<p>That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,</p>
<p>Which heavily 657 he answers with a groan,</p>
<p>More sharp to me than spurring to his side,</p>
<p>For that same groan doth put this in my mind:</p>
<p>My grief lies onward and my joy behind.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>Thus can my love excuse the slow offence 658</p>
<p>Of my dull bearer 659 when from thee I speed:</p>
<p>From where thou art why should I haste me thence?</p>
<p>Till I return, of posting 660 is no need.</p>
<p>O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,</p>
<p>When swift extremity 661 can seem but slow?</p>
<p>Then should I spur 662 , though mounted on the wind:</p>
<p>In wingèd speed no motion shall I know 663 .</p>
<p>Then can no horse with my desire keep pace:</p>
<p>Therefore desire, of perfects 664 love being made,</p>
<p>Shall neigh — no dull flesh 665 — in his fiery race,</p>
<p>But love, for love 666 , thus shall excuse my jade 667 ,</p>
<p>Since from thee go 668 ing he went wilful-slow,</p>
<p>Towards thee I’ll run and give him leave to go.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>So am I as the rich 669 , whose blessèd key</p>
<p>Can bring him to his sweet up-lockèd treasure,</p>
<p>The which he will not ev’ry hour survey,</p>
<p>For blunting the fine point of seldom 670 pleasure.</p>
<p>Therefore are feasts 671 so solemn 672 and so rare 673 ,</p>
<p>Since, seldom coming, in the long year set</p>
<p>Like stones of worth they thinly placèd 674 are,</p>
<p>Or captain 675 jewels in the carcanet 676 .</p>
<p>So is the time that keeps you as 677 my chest 678 ,</p>
<p>Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,</p>
<p>To make some special instant 679 special 680 blest</p>
<p>By new unfolding his imprisoned pride 681 .</p>
<p>Blessèd are you, whose worthiness gives scope,</p>
<p>Being had, to triumph, being lacked, to hope 682 .</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>What is your substance, whereof 683 are you made,</p>
<p>That millions of strange 684 shadows 685 on you tend 686 ?</p>
<p>Since every one hath, every one, one shade 687 ,</p>
<p>And you, but one, can every shadow lend 688 .</p>
<p>Describe Adonis 689 , and the counterfeit 690</p>
<p>Is poorly imitated after you.</p>
<p>On Helen 691 ’s cheek all art of beauty set,</p>
<p>And you in Grecian tires are painted new 692 .</p>
<p>Speak of the spring and foison 693 of the year:</p>
<p>The one doth shadow of your beauty show 694 ,</p>
<p>The other as your bounty 695 doth appear,</p>
<p>And you in every blessèd shape we know 696 .</p>
<p>In all external grace 697 you have some part,</p>
<p>But you like none, none you, for constant heart.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem</p>
<p>By 698 that sweet ornament which truth doth give.</p>
<p>The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem 699</p>
<p>For that sweet odour which doth in it live.</p>
<p>The canker blooms 700 have full as deep a dye</p>
<p>As the perfumèd tincture 701 of the roses,</p>
<p>Hang on such thorns and play 702 as wantonly 703</p>
<p>When summer’s breath their maskèd buds discloses 704 :</p>
<p>But, for their virtue only is their show 705 ,</p>
<p>They live unwooed 706 and unrespected 707 fade,</p>
<p>Die to themselves 708 . Sweet roses do not so:</p>
<p>Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made 709 .</p>
<p>And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,</p>
<p>When that 710 shall fade, my verse distils your truth.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>Not marble nor the gilded monuments 711</p>
<p>Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,</p>
<p>But you shall shine more bright in these contents 712</p>
<p>Than unswept stone besmeared with 713 sluttish time 714 .</p>
<p>When wasteful 715 war shall statues overturn,</p>
<p>And broils 716 root out 717 the work of masonry,</p>
<p>Nor Mars his 718 sword, nor 719 war’s quick 720 fire shall burn</p>
<p>The living record of your memory.</p>
<p>Gainst death and all oblivious enmity 721</p>
<p>Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room</p>
<p>Even in the eyes of all posterity</p>
<p>That wear this world out to the ending doom 722 .</p>
<p>So, till the judgement that yourself arise 723 ,</p>
<p>You live in this 724 , and dwell 725 in love 726 rs’ eyes.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>Sweet love, renew thy force. Be it not said</p>
<p>Thy edge 727 should blunter be than appetite 728 ,</p>
<p>Which but 729 today by feeding is allayed,</p>
<p>Tomorrow sharpened in his former might.</p>
<p>So love, be thou, although today thou fill</p>
<p>Thy hungry eyes even till they wink 730 with fullness,</p>
<p>Tomorrow see again and do not kill</p>
<p>The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness 731 .</p>
<p>Let this sad int’rim 732 like the ocean be</p>
<p>Which parts the shore, where two contracted new 733</p>
<p>Come daily to the banks, that 734 , when they see</p>
<p>Return of love, more blest may be the view:</p>
<p>Or call it 735 winter, which being full of care 736</p>
<p>Makes summer’s welcome thrice more wished, more rare 737 .</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Being your slave, what should I do but tend 738</p>
<p>Upon the hours and times of your desire?</p>
<p>I have no precious time at all to spend,</p>
<p>Nor services to do, till you require.</p>
<p>Nor dare I chide 739 the world-without-end 740 hour</p>
<p>Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,</p>
<p>Nor think the bitterness of absence sour</p>
<p>When you have bid your servant once adieu.</p>
<p>Nor dare I question with my jealous 741 thought</p>
<p>Where you may be, or your affairs suppose 742 ,</p>
<p>But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought</p>
<p>Save where you are how happy you make those 743 .</p>
<p>So true a fool is love that in your Will 744 ,</p>
<p>Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>That god forbid, that made me first your slave 745 ,</p>
<p>I should in thought 746 control 747 your times of pleasure,</p>
<p>Or at your hand th’account of hours to crave 748 ,</p>
<p>Being your vassal 749 , bound to stay your leisure 750 .</p>
<p>O, let me suffer, being at your beck 751 ,</p>
<p>Th’imprisoned absence of your liberty 752 ,</p>
<p>And patience tame to sufferance 753 , bide each check 754</p>
<p>Without accusing you of injury.</p>
<p>Be where you list 755 , your charter 756 is so strong</p>
<p>That you yourself may privilege 757 your time</p>
<p>To what you will: to you it doth belong</p>
<p>Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime 758 .</p>
<p>I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,</p>
<p>Not blame your pleasure, be it ill or well.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>If there be nothing new, but that which is</p>
<p>Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled 759 ,</p>
<p>Which, labouring 760 for invention 761 , bear amiss</p>
<p>The second burden of a former child 762 .</p>
<p>O, that record 763 could with a backward look,</p>
<p>Even of five hundred courses of the sun 764 ,</p>
<p>Show me your image in some antique book,</p>
<p>Since mind at first in character was done 765 ,</p>
<p>That I might see what the old world could say</p>
<p>To this composèd wonder of your frame 766 :</p>
<p>Whether we are mended 767 , or whe’er 768 better they,</p>
<p>Or whether revolution be the same 769 .</p>
<p>O, sure I am the wits 770 of former days</p>
<p>To subjects worse have given admiring praise.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,</p>
<p>So do our minutes hasten to their end,</p>
<p>Each changing place with 771 that which goes before,</p>
<p>In sequent toil all forwards do contend 772 .</p>
<p>Nativity 773 , once in the main 774 of light,</p>
<p>Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,</p>
<p>Crooked 775 eclipses 776 gainst his glory 777 fight,</p>
<p>And Time that gave doth now his gift confound 778 .</p>
<p>Time doth transfix 779 the flourish 780 set on youth</p>
<p>And delves the parallels 781 in beauty’s brow,</p>
<p>Feeds on the rarities 782 of nature’s truth 783 ,</p>
<p>And nothing stands but for his scythe 784 to mow.</p>
<p>And yet to times in hope 785 my verse shall stand,</p>
<p>Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>Is it thy will thy image should keep open</p>
<p>My heavy eyelids to the weary night?</p>
<p>Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,</p>
<p>While shadows 786 like to thee do mock 787 my sight?</p>
<p>Is it thy spirit that thou send’st from thee</p>
<p>So far from home into my deeds to pry,</p>
<p>To find out shames and idle hours in me,</p>
<p>The scope and tenure 788 of 789 thy jealousy?</p>
<p>O no, thy love, though much, is not so great:</p>
<p>It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,</p>
<p>Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat</p>
<p>To play the watchman ever for thy sake.</p>
<p>For thee watch I 790 , whilst thou dost wake 791 elsewhere,</p>
<p>From me far off, with others all too near.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>Sin of self-love possesseth 792 all mine eye</p>
<p>And all my soul and all my every part,</p>
<p>And for this sin there is no remedy,</p>
<p>It is so grounded inward in my heart.</p>
<p>Methinks no face so gracious 793 is as mine,</p>
<p>No shape so true 794 , no truth 795 of such account 796 ,</p>
<p>And for myself 797 mine own worth do define,</p>
<p>As I all other in all worths surmount 798 .</p>
<p>But when my glass 799 shows me myself indeed,</p>
<p>Beated and chopped 800 with tanned antiquity 801 ,</p>
<p>Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:</p>
<p>Self so self-loving were iniquity 802 .</p>
<p>’Tis thee, my self, that for myself I praise 803 ,</p>
<p>Painting my age with beauty of thy days.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>Against 804 my love shall be as I am now</p>
<p>With Time’s injurious 805 hand crushed and o’er-worn 806 ,</p>
<p>When hours have drained his blood 807 and filed 808 his brow</p>
<p>With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn</p>
<p>Hath travelled on to age’s steepy 809 night,</p>
<p>And all those beauties whereof now he’s king</p>
<p>Are vanishing, or vanished, out of sight,</p>
<p>Stealing away the treasure of his spring 810 :</p>
<p>For such a time do I now fortify 811</p>
<p>Against confounding 812 age’s cruel knife,</p>
<p>That 813 he shall never cut from memory</p>
<p>My sweet love’s beauty, though 814 my lover’s life.</p>
<p>His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,</p>
<p>And they shall live and he in them still green 815 .</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>When I have seen by Time’s fell 816 hand defaced</p>
<p>The rich proud cost 817 of outworn 818 buried age,</p>
<p>When sometime 819 lofty towers I see down-razed 820</p>
<p>And brass 821 eternal slave to mortal rage 822 ,</p>
<p>When I have seen the hungry ocean gain</p>
<p>Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,</p>
<p>And the firm soil win of 823 the wat’ry main 824 ,</p>
<p>Increasing store with loss and loss with store 825 826 ,</p>
<p>When I have seen such interchange of state 827 ,</p>
<p>Or state 828 itself confounded to decay 829 ,</p>
<p>Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate 830</p>
<p>That Time will come and take my love away.</p>
<p>This thought is as a death, which cannot choose</p>
<p>But weep to have that which it fears to lose.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>Since 831 brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea,</p>
<p>But sad mortality o’er-sways 832 their power,</p>
<p>How with this rage 833 shall beauty hold a plea 834 ,</p>
<p>Whose action 835 is no stronger than a flower?</p>
<p>O, how shall summer’s honey breath hold out</p>
<p>Against the wrackful 836 siege of batt’ring 837 days,</p>
<p>When rocks impregnable are not so stout,</p>
<p>Nor gates of steel so strong, but time decays?</p>
<p>O fearful meditation! Where, alack,</p>
<p>Shall Time’s best jewel from 838 Time’s chest 839 lie hid?</p>
<p>Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,</p>
<p>Or who his spoil 840 of beauty can forbid?</p>
<p>O none, unless this miracle have might,</p>
<p>That in black ink my love may still shine bright.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>Tired with all these 841 , for restful death I cry,</p>
<p>As to behold desert a beggar born 842 ,</p>
<p>And needy nothing trimmed in jollity 843 ,</p>
<p>And purest faith unhappily forsworn 844 ,</p>
<p>And gilded 845 honour shamefully misplaced,</p>
<p>And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted 846 ,</p>
<p>And right 847 perfection wrongfully disgraced,</p>
<p>And strength by limping sway 848 disablèd,</p>
<p>And art 849 made tongue-tied by authority,</p>
<p>And folly doctor-like 850 controlling skill,</p>
<p>And simple truth miscalled simplicity 851 ,</p>
<p>And captive good attending 852 captain ill.</p>
<p>Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,</p>
<p>Save that to 853 die I leave my love alone.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>Ah, wherefore 854 with infection 855 should he live,</p>
<p>And with his presence grace impiety 856 ,</p>
<p>That sin by 857 him advantage 858 should achieve</p>
<p>And lace 859 itself with his society 860 ?</p>
<p>Why should false painting 861 imitate his cheek</p>
<p>And steal dead seeing 862 of 863 his living hue 864 ?</p>
<p>Why should poor 865 beauty indirectly seek</p>
<p>Roses of shadow 866 , since his rose is true?</p>
<p>Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is 867 ,</p>
<p>Beggared of blood to blush through lively 868 veins,</p>
<p>For she hath no exchequer 869 now but his,</p>
<p>And, proud of many 870 , lives upon his gains 871 ?</p>
<p>O, him she stores 872 , to show what wealth she had</p>
<p>In days long since, before these last so bad.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>Thus 873 is his cheek the map 874 of days outworn 875 ,</p>
<p>When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,</p>
<p>Before these bastard signs of fair 876 were born 877</p>
<p>Or durst inhabit 878 on a living brow,</p>
<p>Before the golden tresses of the dead 879 ,</p>
<p>The right of sepulchres 880 , were shorn away,</p>
<p>To live a second life on second head,</p>
<p>Ere beauty’s dead fleece made another gay 881 :</p>
<p>In him those holy antique hours 882 are seen,</p>
<p>Without all ornament, itself and true,</p>
<p>Making no summer of another’s green,</p>
<p>Robbing no old to dress his beauty new,</p>
<p>And him as for a map doth Nature store,</p>
<p>To show false Art what beauty was of yore 883 .</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>Those parts 884 of thee that the world’s eye doth view</p>
<p>Want 885 nothing that the thought of hearts can mend 886 :</p>
<p>All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,</p>
<p>Utt’ring bare truth, even so as foes commend 887 .</p>
<p>Thy outward 888 thus with outward 889 praise is crowned,</p>
<p>But those same tongues that give thee so thine own 890</p>
<p>In other accents 891 do this praise confound 892</p>
<p>By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.</p>
<p>They look into the beauty of thy mind,</p>
<p>And that, in guess 893 , they measure by thy deeds.</p>
<p>Then, churls 894 , their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,</p>
<p>To thy fair flower add the rank 895 smell of weeds:</p>
<p>But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,</p>
<p>The soil 896 is this, that thou dost common 897 grow.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>That thou art blamed 898 shall not be thy defect 899 ,</p>
<p>For slander’s mark 900 was ever yet the fair:</p>
<p>The ornament of beauty is suspect 901 ,</p>
<p>A crow 902 that flies in heaven’s sweetest air.</p>
<p>So thou be 903 good, slander doth but approve 904</p>
<p>Thy worth the greater, being wooed oft-time:</p>
<p>For canker 905 vice the sweetest buds doth love,</p>
<p>And thou present’st a pure unstainèd 906 prime 907 .</p>
<p>Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days 908 ,</p>
<p>Either not assailed 909 or victor being charged 910 :</p>
<p>Yet this thy praise cannot be so 911 thy praise,</p>
<p>To tie up envy evermore enlarged 912 .</p>
<p>If some suspect of ill 913 masked 914 not thy show,</p>
<p>Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe 915 .</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>No longer mourn for me when I am dead</p>
<p>Than you shall hear the surly sullen 916 bell 917</p>
<p>Give warning to the world that I am fled</p>
<p>From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell.</p>
<p>Nay, if you read this line, remember not</p>
<p>The hand that writ it, for I love you so</p>
<p>That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,</p>
<p>If thinking on me then should make you woe 918 .</p>
<p>O, if, I say, you look upon this verse</p>
<p>When I perhaps compounded 919 am with clay,</p>
<p>Do not so much as my poor name rehearse 920 ,</p>
<p>But let your love even with my life decay,</p>
<p>Lest the wise world should look into your moan 921</p>
<p>And mock you with me 922 after I am gone.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>O, lest the world should task 923 you to recite 924</p>
<p>What merit lived in me, that you should love</p>
<p>After my death, dear love, forget me quite,</p>
<p>For you in me can nothing worthy prove,</p>
<p>Unless you would devise some virtuous lie</p>
<p>To do more for me than mine own desert</p>
<p>And hang more praise upon deceasèd I</p>
<p>Than niggard 925 truth would willingly impart.</p>
<p>O, lest your true love may seem false in this,</p>
<p>That you for love speak well of me untrue 926 ,</p>
<p>My name be buried where my body is</p>
<p>And live no more to shame nor me nor you.</p>
<p>For I am shamed by that which I bring forth 927 ,</p>
<p>And so should you 928 , to love things nothing worth.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>That time of year thou mayst in me behold</p>
<p>When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang</p>
<p>Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,</p>
<p>Bare ruined choirs 929 , where late 930 the sweet birds sang.</p>
<p>In me thou see’st the twilight of such day</p>
<p>As after sunset fadeth in the west,</p>
<p>Which by and by black night doth take away,</p>
<p>Death’s second self 931 , that seals up all in rest 932 .</p>
<p>In me thou see’st the glowing of such fire</p>
<p>That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,</p>
<p>As the death-bed whereon it must expire,</p>
<p>Consumed with that which it was nourished by 933 .</p>
<p>This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong</p>
<p>To love that 934 well which thou must leave 935 ere long.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>But 936 be contented when that fell 937 arrest 938</p>
<p>Without all bail shall carry me away:</p>
<p>My life hath in this line 939 some interest 940 ,</p>
<p>Which for memorial 941 still 942 with thee shall stay.</p>
<p>When thou reviewest 943 this, thou dost review</p>
<p>The very part was consecrate 944 to thee.</p>
<p>The earth can have but earth, which is his due:</p>
<p>My spirit is thine, the better part of me.</p>
<p>So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,</p>
<p>The prey of worms, my body being dead,</p>
<p>The coward 945 conquest of a wretch’s knife 946 ,</p>
<p>Too base 947 of thee to be rememberèd.</p>
<p>The worth of that 948 is that which it contains,</p>
<p>And that is this 949 , and this with thee remains.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>So are you to my thoughts as food to life</p>
<p>Or as sweet-seasoned 950 showers are to the ground,</p>
<p>And for the peace of you 951 I hold such strife 952</p>
<p>As ’twixt 953 a miser and his wealth is found:</p>
<p>Now proud as an enjoyer and anon 954</p>
<p>Doubting 955 the filching 956 age will steal his treasure,</p>
<p>Now counting 957 best to be with you alone,</p>
<p>Then bettered 958 that the world may see my pleasure,</p>
<p>Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,</p>
<p>And by and by clean 959 starvèd for a look,</p>
<p>Possessing or pursuing no delight,</p>
<p>Save what is had or must from you be took.</p>
<p>Thus do I pine 960 and surfeit 961 day by day,</p>
<p>Or gluttoning on all, or 962 all away 963 .</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>Why is my verse so barren of new pride 964 ?</p>
<p>So far from variation or quick change?</p>
<p>Why with the time do I not glance aside</p>
<p>To new-found methods and to compounds strange 965 ?</p>
<p>Why write I still all one 966 , ever the same,</p>
<p>And keep invention 967 in a noted weed 968 ,</p>
<p>That every word doth almost tell my name,</p>
<p>Showing their birth and where they did proceed 969 ?</p>
<p>O know, sweet love, I always write of you,</p>
<p>And you and love are still my argument 970 :</p>
<p>So all my best is dressing old words new,</p>
<p>Spending again what is already spent,</p>
<p>For as the sun is daily new and old,</p>
<p>So is my love still telling 971 what is told.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>Thy glass 972 will show thee how thy beauties wear 973 ,</p>
<p>Thy dial 974 how thy precious minutes waste,</p>
<p>The vacant leaves 975 thy mind’s imprint 976 will bear,</p>
<p>And of this book this learning 977 mayst thou taste.</p>
<p>The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show</p>
<p>Of mouthèd graves will give thee memory 978 ,</p>
<p>Thou by thy dial’s shady stealth 979 mayst know</p>
<p>Time’s thievish progress to eternity.</p>
<p>Look what thy memory cannot contain</p>
<p>Commit to these waste blanks 980 and thou shalt find</p>
<p>Those children 981 nursed, delivered from thy brain,</p>
<p>To take a new acquaintance of 982 thy mind.</p>
<p>These offices 983 , so oft as thou wilt look,</p>
<p>Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse 984</p>
<p>And found such fair 985 assistance in my verse</p>
<p>As 986 every alien 987 pen hath got my use 988</p>
<p>And under thee 989 their poesy disperse.</p>
<p>Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high 990 to sing</p>
<p>And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,</p>
<p>Have added feathers 991 to the learnèd’s wing</p>
<p>And given grace 992 a double majesty 993 .</p>
<p>Yet be most proud of that which I compile 994 ,</p>
<p>Whose influence is thine and born of thee.</p>
<p>In others’ works thou dost but mend 995 the style 996 ,</p>
<p>And arts 997 with thy sweet graces gracèd be 998 :</p>
<p>But thou art 999 all my art and dost advance 1000</p>
<p>As high as learning my rude 1001 ignorance.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,</p>
<p>My verse alone had all thy gentle grace 1002 ,</p>
<p>But now my gracious numbers 1003 are decayed</p>
<p>And my sick Muse 1004 doth give another place 1005 .</p>
<p>I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument 1006</p>
<p>Deserves the travail 1007 of a worthier pen,</p>
<p>Yet what of thee 1008 thy poet doth invent 1009</p>
<p>He robs thee of and pays it thee again.</p>
<p>He lends thee virtue and he stole that word</p>
<p>From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give</p>
<p>And found it in thy cheek: he can afford 1010</p>
<p>No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.</p>
<p>Then thank him not for that which he doth say,</p>
<p>Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>O, how I faint 1011 when I of you do write,</p>
<p>Knowing a better spirit 1012 doth use your name</p>
<p>And in the praise thereof spends all his might</p>
<p>To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame.</p>
<p>But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,</p>
<p>The humble as 1013 the proudest 1014 sail doth bear,</p>
<p>My saucy bark 1015 inferior far to his</p>
<p>On your broad main 1016 doth wilfully 1017 appear.</p>
<p>Your shallowest help 1018 will hold me up afloat,</p>
<p>Whilst he upon your soundless 1019 deep doth ride,</p>
<p>Or being wrecked, I am a worthless boat,</p>
<p>He of tall building 1020 and of goodly pride 1021 .</p>
<p>Then if he thrive and I be cast away 1022 ,</p>
<p>The worst was this: my love was my decay 1023 .</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>Or I shall live your epitaph to make,</p>
<p>Or 1024 you survive when I in earth am rotten,</p>
<p>From hence 1025 your memory death cannot take,</p>
<p>Although in me each part 1026 will be forgotten.</p>
<p>Your name from hence immortal life shall have,</p>
<p>Though I, once gone, to all the world 1027 must die.</p>
<p>The earth can yield me but a common 1028 grave,</p>
<p>When you entombèd in men’s eyes shall lie.</p>
<p>Your monument 1029 shall be my gentle 1030 verse,</p>
<p>Which eyes not yet created shall o’er-read,</p>
<p>And tongues to be 1031 your being shall rehearse 1032</p>
<p>When all the breathers of this world 1033 are dead.</p>
<p>You still 1034 shall live — such virtue 1035 hath my pen —</p>
<p>Where breath most breathes, ev’n in the 1036 mouths of men.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>I grant 1037 thou wert not married to my Muse 1038</p>
<p>And therefore mayst without attaint 1039 o’erlook 1040</p>
<p>The dedicated words 1041 which writers use</p>
<p>Of their fair subject, blessing 1042 every book.</p>
<p>Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue 1043 ,</p>
<p>Finding thy worth a limit past 1044 my praise,</p>
<p>And therefore art enforced to seek anew</p>
<p>Some fresher stamp 1045 of the time-bett’ring days 1046 .</p>
<p>And do so, love, yet when they have devised</p>
<p>What strainèd 1047 touches rhetoric can lend,</p>
<p>Thou, truly fair, wert truly sympathized 1048</p>
<p>In true plain words by thy true-telling friend.</p>
<p>And their gross 1049 painting 1050 might be better used</p>
<p>Where cheeks need blood: in thee it is abused 1051 .</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>I never saw that you did painting 1052 need,</p>
<p>And therefore to your fair 1053 no painting set 1054 .</p>
<p>I found, or thought I found, you did exceed</p>
<p>The barren tender 1055 of a poet’s debt,</p>
<p>And therefore have I slept in your report 1056 ,</p>
<p>That 1057 you yourself being extant 1058 well might show</p>
<p>How far a modern 1059 quill doth come too short,</p>
<p>Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow 1060 .</p>
<p>This silence for my sin 1061 you did impute 1062 ,</p>
<p>Which shall be most my glory, being dumb,</p>
<p>For I impair not beauty being mute,</p>
<p>When others would 1063 give life and bring a tomb 1064 .</p>
<p>There lives more life in one of your fair eyes</p>
<p>Than both your poets 1065 can in praise devise.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>Who is it that says most, which 1066 can say more</p>
<p>Than this rich praise, that you alone are you 1067 ,</p>
<p>In whose confine immurèd 1068 is the store 1069</p>
<p>Which should example where your equal grew 1070 ?</p>
<p>Lean penury 1071 within that pen doth dwell</p>
<p>That to his subject lends not some small glory,</p>
<p>But he that writes of you, if he can tell</p>
<p>That you are you, so dignifies his story 1072 .</p>
<p>Let him but 1073 copy what in you is writ,</p>
<p>Not making worse what nature made so clear,</p>
<p>And such a counterpart shall fame his wit 1074 ,</p>
<p>Making his style admirèd everywhere.</p>
<p>You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,</p>
<p>Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse 1075 .</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>My tongue-tied Muse 1076 in manners holds her still 1077 ,</p>
<p>While comments of your praise, richly compiled,</p>
<p>Reserve their character 1078 with golden quill 1079</p>
<p>And precious phrase by all the Muses filed 1080 .</p>
<p>I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,</p>
<p>And like unlettered clerk 1081 still cry ‘Amen’</p>
<p>To every hymn that able spirit affords 1082</p>
<p>In polished form of well-refinèd pen.</p>
<p>Hearing you praised, I say, ‘’Tis so, ’tis true’,</p>
<p>And to the most of praise add something more:</p>
<p>But that is in my thought, whose love to you,</p>
<p>Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before 1083 .</p>
<p>Then others for the breath of words respect 1084 ,</p>
<p>Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect 1085 .</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,</p>
<p>Bound for the prize 1086 of all-too-precious you,</p>
<p>That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse 1087 ,</p>
<p>Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?</p>
<p>Was it his spirit 1088 , by spirits 1089 taught to write</p>
<p>Above a mortal pitch 1090 , that struck me dead 1091 ?</p>
<p>No, neither he nor his compeers 1092 by night</p>
<p>Giving him aid, my verse astonishèd 1093 .</p>
<p>He, nor that affable familiar ghost 1094</p>
<p>Which nightly gulls 1095 him with intelligence 1096 ,</p>
<p>As victors of my silence cannot boast.</p>
<p>I was not sick of any fear from thence,</p>
<p>But when your countenance 1097 filled up 1098 his line 1099 ,</p>
<p>Then lacked I matter 1100 , that enfeebled mine.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>Farewell, thou art too dear 1101 for my possessing,</p>
<p>And like enough thou know’st thy estimate 1102 .</p>
<p>The charter of thy worth 1103 gives thee releasing 1104 ,</p>
<p>My bonds 1105 in thee are all determinate 1106 .</p>
<p>For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?</p>
<p>And for that riches where is my deserving?</p>
<p>The cause of 1107 this fair gift in me is wanting 1108 ,</p>
<p>And so my patent 1109 back again is swerving 1110 .</p>
<p>Thyself thou gav’st, thy own worth then not knowing,</p>
<p>Or me, to whom thou gav’st it, else mistaking;</p>
<p>So thy great gift, upon misprision growing 1111 ,</p>
<p>Comes home again, on better judgement making.</p>
<p>Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter:</p>
<p>In sleep a king, but waking no such matter 1112 .</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>When thou shalt be disposed to set me light 1113</p>
<p>And place my merit in the eye of scorn 1114 ,</p>
<p>Upon thy side against myself I’ll fight</p>
<p>And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn 1115 .</p>
<p>With mine own weakness being best acquainted,</p>
<p>Upon thy part 1116 I can set down a story</p>
<p>Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted 1117 ,</p>
<p>That 1118 thou in losing me shalt win much glory:</p>
<p>And I by this will be a gainer too,</p>
<p>For bending 1119 all my loving thoughts on thee,</p>
<p>The injuries that to myself I do,</p>
<p>Doing thee vantage 1120 , double-vantage 1121 me.</p>
<p>Such is my love, to thee I so belong,</p>
<p>That for thy right myself will bear all wrong 1122 .</p>
<p>89 1123</p>
<p>Say that thou didst forsake 1124 me for some fault</p>
<p>And I will comment upon 1125 that offence,</p>
<p>Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt 1126 ,</p>
<p>Against thy reasons making no defence.</p>
<p>Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,</p>
<p>To set a form upon desirèd change 1127 ,</p>
<p>As I’ll myself disgrace, knowing thy will,</p>
<p>I will acquaintance strangle and look strange 1128 ,</p>
<p>Be absent from thy walks 1129 , and in my tongue</p>
<p>Thy sweet belovèd name no more shall dwell,</p>
<p>Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong</p>
<p>And haply 1130 of our old acquaintance tell.</p>
<p>For thee, against myself I’ll vow debate 1131 ,</p>
<p>For I must ne’er love him whom thou dost hate.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>Then 1132 hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,</p>
<p>Now, while the world is bent 1133 my deeds to cross 1134 ,</p>
<p>Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,</p>
<p>And do not drop in for an after-loss 1135 .</p>
<p>Ah do not, when my heart hath scaped 1136 this sorrow,</p>
<p>Come in the rearward of a conquered woe 1137 ,</p>
<p>Give not a windy night a rainy morrow</p>
<p>To linger out a purposed overthrow 1138 .</p>
<p>If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,</p>
<p>When other petty griefs have done their spite,</p>
<p>But in the onset 1139 come: so shall I taste</p>
<p>At first the very worst of fortune’s might,</p>
<p>And other strains 1140 of woe, which now seem woe,</p>
<p>Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>Some glory 1141 in their birth, some in their skill,</p>
<p>Some in their wealth, some in their body’s force,</p>
<p>Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill 1142 ,</p>
<p>Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse,</p>
<p>And every humour 1143 hath his adjunct 1144 pleasure,</p>
<p>Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,</p>
<p>But these particulars are not my measure 1145 :</p>
<p>All these I better 1146 in one general best.</p>
<p>Thy love is better than high birth to me,</p>
<p>Richer than wealth, prouder than garments’ cost 1147 ,</p>
<p>Of more delight than hawks or horses be:</p>
<p>And having thee, of all men’s pride I boast —</p>
<p>Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take</p>
<p>All this away and me most wretched make.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>But 1148 do thy worst to steal thyself away,</p>
<p>For term of life 1149 thou art assurèd mine,</p>
<p>And life no longer than thy love will stay,</p>
<p>For it depends upon that love of thine.</p>
<p>Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs 1150 ,</p>
<p>When in the least of them my life hath end 1151 .</p>
<p>I see a better state to me belongs</p>
<p>Than that which on thy humour 1152 doth depend.</p>
<p>Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,</p>
<p>Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie 1153 .</p>
<p>O, what a happy 1154 title 1155 do I find,</p>
<p>Happy to have thy love, happy to die.</p>
<p>But what’s so blessèd-fair 1156 that fears no blot 1157 ?</p>
<p>Thou mayst be false 1158 , and yet I know it not.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>So 1159 shall I live, supposing thou art true,</p>
<p>Like a deceivèd husband: so love’s face 1160</p>
<p>May still seem love to me, though altered new 1161 ,</p>
<p>Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place,</p>
<p>For there can live no hatred in thine eye,</p>
<p>Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.</p>
<p>In many’s looks the false heart’s history</p>
<p>Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles 1162 strange,</p>
<p>But heaven in thy creation did decree</p>
<p>That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell.</p>
<p>Whate’er thy thoughts or thy heart’s workings be,</p>
<p>Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.</p>
<p>How like Eve’s apple 1163 doth thy beauty grow,</p>
<p>If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show 1164 .</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>They that have power to hurt and will do none,</p>
<p>That do not do the thing they most do show 1165 ,</p>
<p>Who, moving 1166 others, are themselves as stone,</p>
<p>Unmovèd, cold 1167 , and to temptation slow:</p>
<p>They rightly do inherit heaven’s graces</p>
<p>And husband nature’s riches from expense 1168 .</p>
<p>They are the lords and owners of their faces 1169 ,</p>
<p>Others but stewards 1170 of their excellence.</p>
<p>The summer’s flower is to the summer sweet,</p>
<p>Though to itself 1171 it only live and die,</p>
<p>But if that flower with base 1172 infection 1173 meet,</p>
<p>The basest 1174 weed outbraves 1175 his dignity:</p>
<p>For sweetest things 1176 turn sourest by their deeds 1177 ,</p>
<p>Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds 1178 .</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame</p>
<p>Which, like a canker 1179 in the fragrant rose,</p>
<p>Doth spot 1180 the beauty of thy budding name 1181 .</p>
<p>O, in what sweets 1182 dost thou thy sins enclose!</p>
<p>That tongue that tells the story of thy days,</p>
<p>Making lascivious comments on thy sport 1183 ,</p>
<p>Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise:</p>
<p>Naming thy name blesses an ill report.</p>
<p>O, what a mansion 1184 have those vices got</p>
<p>Which for their habitation chose out thee,</p>
<p>Where beauty’s veil doth cover every blot,</p>
<p>And all things turns to fair that eyes can see.</p>
<p>Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege 1185 :</p>
<p>The hardest knife 1186 ill-used 1187 doth lose his edge 1188 .</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness 1189 ,</p>
<p>Some say thy grace is youth and gentle 1190 sport,</p>
<p>Both grace and faults are loved of more and less 1191 :</p>
<p>Thou mak’st faults graces that to thee resort 1192 .</p>
<p>As on the finger of a thronèd queen</p>
<p>The basest 1193 jewel will be well esteemed,</p>
<p>So are those errors 1194 that in thee are seen</p>
<p>To truths 1195 translated 1196 and for true things deemed.</p>
<p>How many lambs might the stem wolf betray,</p>
<p>If like a lamb he could his looks translate 1197 ?</p>
<p>How many gazers 1198 mightst thou lead away 1199 ,</p>
<p>If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state 1200 ?</p>
<p>But do not so: I love thee in such sort</p>
<p>As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report 1201 .</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>How like a winter hath my absence been</p>
<p>From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year.</p>
<p>What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen,</p>
<p>What old December’s bareness everywhere.</p>
<p>And yet this time removed 1202 was summer’s time,</p>
<p>The teeming 1203 autumn, big 1204 with rich increase 1205 ,</p>
<p>Bearing 1206 the wanton burden of the prime 1207 ,</p>
<p>Like widowed wombs after their lords’ 1208 decease:</p>
<p>Yet this abundant issue 1209 seemed to me</p>
<p>But hope of orphans and unfathered 1210 fruit 1211 ,</p>
<p>For summer and his pleasures wait 1212 on thee,</p>
<p>And, thou away, the very birds are mute —</p>
<p>Or if they sing, ’tis with so dull a cheer</p>
<p>That leaves look pale, dreading the winter’s near.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>From you have I been absent in the spring,</p>
<p>When proud-pied 1213 April dressed in all his trim 1214</p>
<p>Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,</p>
<p>That 1215 heavy Saturn 1216 laughed and leaped with him.</p>
<p>Yet nor the lays 1217 of birds nor 1218 the sweet smell</p>
<p>Of different flowers 1219 in odour and in hue</p>
<p>Could make me any summer’s 1220 story tell,</p>
<p>Or from their proud 1221 lap 1222 pluck them where they grew.</p>
<p>Nor did I wonder at the lily’s white,</p>
<p>Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose.</p>
<p>They were but 1223 sweet, but figures 1224 of delight,</p>
<p>Drawn after 1225 you, you pattern 1226 of all those.</p>
<p>Yet seemed it winter still and, you away,</p>
<p>As 1227 with your shadow 1228 I with these did play.</p>
<p>99 1229</p>
<p>The forward 1230 violet thus did I chide 1231 :</p>
<p>Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells 1232 ,</p>
<p>If not from my love’s breath? The purple pride 1233</p>
<p>Which on thy soft cheek for complexion 1234 dwells</p>
<p>In my love’s veins thou hast too grossly 1235 dyed.</p>
<p>The lily I condemnèd for thy hand 1236 ,</p>
<p>And buds of marjoram 1237 had stol’n thy hair:</p>
<p>The roses fearfully on thorns did stand 1238 ,</p>
<p>One blushing shame, another white 1239 despair,</p>
<p>A third, nor red nor white, had stol’n of both</p>
<p>And to his robb’ry had annexed thy breath 1240 :</p>
<p>But for 1241 his theft, in pride of all his growth 1242 ,</p>
<p>A vengeful canker 1243 eat 1244 him up to death.</p>
<p>More flowers I noted, yet I none could see</p>
<p>But sweet or colour it had stol’n from thee 1245 .</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>Where art thou, Muse 1246 , that thou forget’st so long</p>
<p>To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?</p>
<p>Spend’st thou thy fury 1247 on some worthless song,</p>
<p>Dark’ning thy power to lend base subjects light 1248 ?</p>
<p>Return, forgetful Muse, and straight 1249 redeem</p>
<p>In gentle numbers 1250 time so idly 1251 spent,</p>
<p>Sing to the ear that doth thy lays 1252 esteem</p>
<p>And gives thy pen both skill and argument 1253 .</p>
<p>Rise, resty 1254 Muse, my love’s sweet face survey,</p>
<p>If Time have any wrinkle graven 1255 there,</p>
<p>If any, be a satire to 1256 decay</p>
<p>And make Time’s spoils 1257 despisèd everywhere.</p>
<p>Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,</p>
<p>So 1258 thou prevent’st 1259 his scythe and crooked knife 1260 .</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>O truant Muse 1261 , what shall be thy amends 1262</p>
<p>For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed 1263 ?</p>
<p>Both truth and beauty on my love depends 1264 ,</p>
<p>So dost thou too, and therein dignified 1265 .</p>
<p>Make answer, Muse. Wilt thou not haply 1266 say,</p>
<p>’Truth needs no colour 1267 , with his colour fixed 1268 ,</p>
<p>Beauty no pencil 1269 , beauty’s truth to lay 1270 ,</p>
<p>But best is best, if never intermixed 1271 ’?</p>
<p>Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?</p>
<p>Excuse not silence so, for’t lies in thee 1272</p>
<p>To make him much outlive a gilded tomb</p>
<p>And to be praised of ages yet to be.</p>
<p>Then do thy office 1273 , Muse. I teach thee how</p>
<p>To make him seem long hence 1274 , as he shows 1275 now.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>My love is strengthened, though more weak in seeming 1276 :</p>
<p>I love not less, though less the show appear.</p>
<p>That love is merchandised 1277 whose rich esteeming 1278</p>
<p>The owner’s tongue doth publish 1279 everywhere.</p>
<p>Our love was new and then but in the spring,</p>
<p>When I was wont 1280 to greet it with my lays 1281 ,</p>
<p>As Philomel 1282 in summer’s front 1283 doth sing</p>
<p>And stops his pipe 1284 in growth of riper days 1285 :</p>
<p>Not that the summer is less pleasant now</p>
<p>Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,</p>
<p>But that wild 1286 music burdens 1287 every bough,</p>
<p>And sweets 1288 grown common lose their dear delight.</p>
<p>Therefore, like her, I sometime hold my tongue,</p>
<p>Because I would not dull 1289 you with my song.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>Alack, what poverty 1290 my Muse brings forth,</p>
<p>That having such a scope to show her pride 1291 ,</p>
<p>The argument all bare 1292 is of more worth</p>
<p>Than when it hath my added praise beside.</p>
<p>O, blame me not, if I no more can write.</p>
<p>Look in your glass 1293 , and there appears a face</p>
<p>That overgoes 1294 my blunt invention 1295 quite,</p>
<p>Dulling 1296 my lines and doing me disgrace.</p>
<p>Were it not sinful then, striving to mend 1297 ,</p>
<p>To mar 1298 the subject that before was well?</p>
<p>For to no other pass 1299 my verses tend</p>
<p>Than of your graces 1300 and your gifts to tell.</p>
<p>And more, much more, than in my verse can sit</p>
<p>Your own glass shows you when you look in it.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>To me, fair friend, you never can be old,</p>
<p>For as you were when first your eye I eyed 1301 ,</p>
<p>Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold</p>
<p>Have from the forests shook three summers’ pride 1302 ,</p>
<p>Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned</p>
<p>In process of the seasons have I seen,</p>
<p>Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,</p>
<p>Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green 1303 .</p>
<p>Ah yet doth beauty, like a dial hand 1304 ,</p>
<p>Steal 1305 from his figure 1306 and no pace 1307 perceived:</p>
<p>So your sweet hue 1308 , which methinks still doth stand 1309 ,</p>
<p>Hath motion 1310 and mine eye may be deceived.</p>
<p>For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred 1311 :</p>
<p>Ere 1312 you were born was beauty’s summer dead.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>Let not my love be called idolatry 1313 ,</p>
<p>Nor my belovèd as an idol show 1314 ,</p>
<p>Since 1315 all alike my songs and praises be</p>
<p>To one, of one 1316 , still 1317 such and ever so.</p>
<p>Kind 1318 is my love today, tomorrow kind,</p>
<p>Still constant in a wondrous excellence.</p>
<p>Therefore my verse to constancy confined,</p>
<p>One thing expressing, leaves out difference.</p>
<p>‘Fair 1319 , kind and true 1320’ is all my argument 1321 ,</p>
<p>‘Fair, kind and true’ varying to 1322 other words,</p>
<p>And in this change is my invention spent 1323 ,</p>
<p>Three themes in one 1324 , which wondrous scope affords.</p>
<p>Fair, kind and true have often lived alone,</p>
<p>Which three till now never kept seat 1325 in one.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>When in the chronicle 1326 of wasted 1327 time</p>
<p>I see descriptions of the fairest wights 1328 ,</p>
<p>And beauty making beautiful old rhyme</p>
<p>In praise of ladies dead and lovely 1329 knights,</p>
<p>Then in the blazon 1330 of sweet beauty’s best,</p>
<p>Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,</p>
<p>I see their antique pen would have expressed</p>
<p>Even 1331 such a beauty as you master 1332 now.</p>
<p>So all their praises are but prophecies</p>
<p>Of this our time, all you prefiguring,</p>
<p>And, for 1333 they looked but with divining 1334 eyes,</p>
<p>They had not skill enough your worth to sing:</p>
<p>For we, which now behold these present days,</p>
<p>Have eyes to wonder 1335 , but lack tongues to praise.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul</p>
<p>Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,</p>
<p>Can yet the lease of my true love control 1336 ,</p>
<p>Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom 1337 .</p>
<p>The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured 1338 1339</p>
<p>And the sad augurs 1340 mock their own presage 1341 ,</p>
<p>Incertainties now crown themselves assured 1342</p>
<p>And peace proclaims olives of endless age 1343 .</p>
<p>Now with the drops of this most balmy 1344 time</p>
<p>My love looks fresh and Death to me subscribes 1345 ,</p>
<p>Since, spite of him, I’ll live in this poor rhyme,</p>
<p>While he insults 1346 o’er dull and speechless tribes.</p>
<p>And thou in this shalt find thy monument 1347 ,</p>
<p>When tyrants’ crests 1348 and tombs of brass are spent 1349 .</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>What’s in the brain that ink may character 1350</p>
<p>Which hath not figured 1351 to thee my true spirit?</p>
<p>What’s new to speak, what now to register 1352 ,</p>
<p>That may express my love or thy dear merit?</p>
<p>Nothing, sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine</p>
<p>I must each day say o’er the very same,</p>
<p>Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,</p>
<p>Even as when first I hallowed 1353 thy fair name.</p>
<p>So that eternal love in love’s fresh case 1354</p>
<p>Weighs not 1355 the dust and injury of age,</p>
<p>Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place 1356 ,</p>
<p>But makes antiquity 1357 for aye 1358 his page 1359 ,</p>
<p>Finding the first conceit 1360 of love there 1361 bred,</p>
<p>Where time and outward form would show it 1362 dead.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>O, never say that I was false of heart 1363 ,</p>
<p>Though absence seemed my flame to qualify 1364 .</p>
<p>As easy might I from myself depart</p>
<p>As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:</p>
<p>That is my home of love. If I have ranged 1365 ,</p>
<p>Like him that travels I return again,</p>
<p>Just to the time, not with the time exchanged 1366 ,</p>
<p>So that myself bring water for my stain 1367 .</p>
<p>Never believe, though in my nature reigned</p>
<p>All frailties 1368 that besiege all kinds of blood 1369 ,</p>
<p>That it could so preposterously 1370 be stained 1371 ,</p>
<p>To leave for nothing 1372 all thy sum of good:</p>
<p>For nothing this wide universe I call,</p>
<p>Save thou, my rose — in it thou art my all.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>Alas, ’tis true, I have gone 1373 here and there</p>
<p>And made myself a motley 1374 to the view,</p>
<p>Gored 1375 mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,</p>
<p>Made old offences of affections new 1376 .</p>
<p>Most true it is that I have looked on truth</p>
<p>Askance and strangely 1377 , but, by all above 1378 ,</p>
<p>These blenches 1379 gave my heart another youth,</p>
<p>And worse essays 1380 proved thee my best of love.</p>
<p>Now all is done, have what shall have no end 1381 :</p>
<p>Mine appetite 1382 I never more will grind 1383</p>
<p>On newer proof 1384 , to try 1385 an older friend,</p>
<p>A god in love, to whom I am confined 1386 .</p>
<p>Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best 1387 ,</p>
<p>Even to thy pure and most most loving 1388 breast.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide 1389 ,</p>
<p>The guilty goddess of 1390 my harmful deeds,</p>
<p>That did not better for my life provide</p>
<p>Than public means 1391 which public manners breeds 1392 .</p>
<p>Thence comes it that my name receives a brand 1393 ,</p>
<p>And almost 1394 thence my nature is subdued 1395</p>
<p>To 1396 what it works in, like the dyer’s hand.</p>
<p>Pity me then and wish I were renewed 1397 ,</p>
<p>Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink</p>
<p>Potions of eisel 1398 gainst my strong infection,</p>
<p>No bitterness 1399 that I will bitter think,</p>
<p>Nor double penance to correct correction 1400 .</p>
<p>Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye</p>
<p>Even that your pity is enough to cure me.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>Your love and pity doth th’impression 1401 fill</p>
<p>Which vulgar 1402 scandal stamped upon my brow,</p>
<p>For what care I who calls me well or ill,</p>
<p>So 1403 you o’er-green 1404 my bad, my good allow 1405 ?</p>
<p>You are my all the world and I must strive</p>
<p>To know my shames and praises from your tongue.</p>
<p>None else to me, nor I to none alive,</p>
<p>That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong 1406 .</p>
<p>In so profound abysm 1407 I throw all care</p>
<p>Of others’ voices, that my adder’s sense 1408</p>
<p>To critic and to flatterer stoppèd are.</p>
<p>Mark how with my neglect I do dispense 1409 :</p>
<p>You are so strongly in my purpose bred 1410</p>
<p>That all the world besides me thinks you’re dead.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,</p>
<p>And that which governs me to go about 1411</p>
<p>Doth part 1412 his function and is partly blind,</p>
<p>Seems seeing 1413 , but effectually is out 1414 ,</p>
<p>For it no form delivers to the heart 1415</p>
<p>Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch 1416 .</p>
<p>Of his quick objects 1417 hath the mind no part,</p>
<p>Nor 1418 his own vision holds what it doth catch,</p>
<p>For if it see the rud’st or gentlest 1419 sight,</p>
<p>The most sweet favour 1420 or deformed’st creature,</p>
<p>The mountain or the sea, the day or night,</p>
<p>The crow or dove, it shapes 1421 them to your feature.</p>
<p>Incapable of 1422 more, replete with you,</p>
<p>My most true 1423 mind thus makes mine eye untrue 1424 .</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>Or whether 1425 doth my mind, being crowned with you 1426 ,</p>
<p>Drink up the monarch’s plague, this flattery?</p>
<p>Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,</p>
<p>And that your love taught it this alchemy 1427 ,</p>
<p>To make of monsters and things indigest 1428</p>
<p>Such cherubins 1429 as your sweet self resemble,</p>
<p>Creating every bad 1430 a perfect best,</p>
<p>As fast as objects to his beams 1431 assemble?</p>
<p>O, ’tis the first, ’tis flatt’ry in my seeing,</p>
<p>And my great mind most kingly 1432 drinks it up:</p>
<p>Mine eye well knows what with his gust is ’greeing 1433 ,</p>
<p>And to his palate doth prepare the cup.</p>
<p>If it be poisoned, ’tis the lesser sin</p>
<p>That mine eye loves it and doth first begin 1434 .</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>Those lines that I before have writ do lie,</p>
<p>Even those that said I could not love you dearer:</p>
<p>Yet then my judgement knew no reason why</p>
<p>My most full 1435 flame should afterwards burn clearer.</p>
<p>But reckoning time 1436 , whose 1437 millioned accidents 1438</p>
<p>Creep in ’twixt vows 1439 and change decrees of kings,</p>
<p>Tan 1440 sacred beauty, blunt the sharp’st intents,</p>
<p>Divert strong minds to th’course of alt’ring 1441 things —</p>
<p>Alas why, fearing of Time’s tyranny,</p>
<p>Might I not then say 1442 , ‘Now I love you best’,</p>
<p>When I was certain o’er incertainty,</p>
<p>Crowning 1443 the present, doubting of the rest?</p>
<p>Love is a babe 1444 : then might I not say so 1445 ,</p>
<p>To give full grow 1446 th to that which still doth grow?</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds</p>
<p>Admit 1447 impediments 1448 . Love is not love</p>
<p>Which alters when it alteration finds</p>
<p>Or bends with the remove 1449 r to remove.</p>
<p>O no, it is an ever-fixèd mark 1450</p>
<p>That looks on tempests and is never shaken,</p>
<p>It is the star 1451 to every wand’ring bark 1452 ,</p>
<p>Whose worth’s unknown 1453 , although his height be taken 1454 .</p>
<p>Love’s not Time’s fool 1455 , though rosy lips and cheeks</p>
<p>Within his bending 1456 sickle’s compass 1457 come:</p>
<p>Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,</p>
<p>But bears it out even to the edge of doom 1458 .</p>
<p>If this be error and upon me proved 1459 ,</p>
<p>I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>Accuse 1460 me thus: that I have scanted 1461 all</p>
<p>Wherein I should your great deserts repay,</p>
<p>Forgot upon your dearest love to call 1462 ,</p>
<p>Whereto all bonds 1463 do tie me day by day,</p>
<p>That I have frequent 1464 been with unknown minds 1465</p>
<p>And given to time your own dear-purchased right 1466 ,</p>
<p>That I have hoisted sail to all the winds</p>
<p>Which should transport me farthest from your sight.</p>
<p>Book 1467 both my wilfulness and errors down,</p>
<p>And on just proof 1468 surmise, accumulate 1469 ,</p>
<p>Bring me within the level 1470 of your frown,</p>
<p>But shoot not at me in your wakened hate 1471 ,</p>
<p>Since my appeal 1472 says I did strive to prove</p>
<p>The constancy and virtue 1473 of your love.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>Like as 1474 to make our appetites more keen</p>
<p>With eager compounds 1475 we our palate urge 1476 ,</p>
<p>As to prevent our maladies unseen 1477</p>
<p>We sicken 1478 to shun 1479 sickness when we purge 1480 ,</p>
<p>Even so 1481 , being full of your ne’er-cloying sweetness,</p>
<p>To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding 1482</p>
<p>And, sick of welfare 1483 , found a kind of meetness 1484</p>
<p>To be diseased ere that there was true needing 1485 .</p>
<p>Thus policy in love, t’anticipate</p>
<p>The ills that were not, grew to faults assured 1486</p>
<p>And brought to medicine 1487 a healthful state</p>
<p>Which, rank of 1488 goodness, would by ill be cured.</p>
<p>But thence I learn and find the lesson true,</p>
<p>Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>What potions have I drunk of siren 1489 tears,</p>
<p>Distilled from limbecks 1490 foul 1491 as hell within,</p>
<p>Applying 1492 fears to hopes and hopes to fears,</p>
<p>Still losing when I saw myself to 1493 win?</p>
<p>What wretched errors hath my heart committed,</p>
<p>Whilst it hath thought itself so blessèd never 1494 ?</p>
<p>How have mine eyes out of their spheres 1495 been fitted 1496</p>
<p>In the distraction of this madding 1497 fever?</p>
<p>O benefit of ill, now I find true</p>
<p>That better is by evil still made better,</p>
<p>And ruined love, when it is built anew,</p>
<p>Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.</p>
<p>So I return rebuked to my content 1498</p>
<p>And gain by ills thrice 1499 more than I have spent.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>That you were once unkind befriends me 1500 now,</p>
<p>And for that sorrow which I then did feel</p>
<p>Needs must I 1501 under my transgression bow 1502 ,</p>
<p>Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.</p>
<p>For if you were by my unkindness shaken</p>
<p>As I by yours, you’ve passed a hell of 1503 time,</p>
<p>And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken 1504</p>
<p>To weigh 1505 how once I suffered in your crime.</p>
<p>O, that our night of woe might have remembered 1506</p>
<p>My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits,</p>
<p>And soon to you, as you to me then, tendered 1507</p>
<p>The humble salve 1508 which wounded bosoms fits 1509 .</p>
<p>But that your trespass 1510 now becomes a fee:</p>
<p>Mine ransoms 1511 yours and yours must ransom me.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>’Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed 1512 ,</p>
<p>When not to be receives reproach of being 1513 ,</p>
<p>And the just 1514 pleasure lost which is so deemed 1515</p>
<p>Not by our feeling but by others’ seeing.</p>
<p>For why should others’ false 1516 adulterate 1517 eyes</p>
<p>Give salutation to 1518 my sportive blood 1519 ?</p>
<p>Or on my frailties why are frailer spies 1520 ,</p>
<p>Which in their wills 1521 count bad what I think good?</p>
<p>No, I am that 1522 I am and they that level 1523</p>
<p>At my abuses 1524 reckon 1525 up their own:</p>
<p>I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel 1526 .</p>
<p>By 1527 their rank 1528 thoughts my deeds must not be shown 1529
,</p>
<p>Unless this general evil they maintain 1530 :</p>
<p>All men are bad and in their badness reign 1531 .</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>Thy gift, thy tables 1532 , are within my brain</p>
<p>Full charactered 1533 with lasting memory,</p>
<p>Which shall above that idle rank 1534 remain</p>
<p>Beyond all date 1535 , even to eternity,</p>
<p>Or at the least, so long as brain and heart</p>
<p>Have faculty 1536 by nature to subsist,</p>
<p>Till each to razed 1537 oblivion yield his part</p>
<p>Of thee, thy record never can be missed.</p>
<p>That poor retention 1538 could not so much hold,</p>
<p>Nor need I tallies 1539 thy dear love to score.</p>
<p>Therefore to give them from me was I bold 1540 ,</p>
<p>To trust those tables that receive thee more 1541 .</p>
<p>To keep an adjunct 1542 to remember thee</p>
<p>Were to import 1543 forgetfulness in me.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change.</p>
<p>Thy pyramids 1544 built up with newer might 1545</p>
<p>To me are nothing novel, nothing strange:</p>
<p>They are but dressings of a former sight 1546 .</p>
<p>Our dates 1547 are brief and therefore we admire</p>
<p>What thou dost foist 1548 upon us that is old,</p>
<p>And rather make them born to our desire 1549</p>
<p>Than think that we before have heard them told.</p>
<p>Thy registers 1550 and thee I both defy,</p>
<p>Not wond’ring 1551 at the present nor the past,</p>
<p>For thy records and what we see doth lie 1552 ,</p>
<p>Made more or less by thy continual haste 1553 .</p>
<p>This I do vow and this shall ever be:</p>
<p>I will be true 1554 , despite thy scythe and thee.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>If my dear love 1555 were but the child of state 1556 ,</p>
<p>It might for 1557 Fortune’s bastard be unfathered 1558 ,</p>
<p>As subject to time’s love or to time’s hate,</p>
<p>Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered 1559 .</p>
<p>No, it was builded far from accident 1560 ,</p>
<p>It suffers not in smiling pomp 1561 , nor falls</p>
<p>Under the blow of thrallèd discontent 1562 ,</p>
<p>Whereto th’inviting time our fashion calls 1563 .</p>
<p>It fears not policy 1564 , that heretic 1565 ,</p>
<p>Which works on leases of short-numbered hours 1566 ,</p>
<p>But all alone stands hugely politic 1567 ,</p>
<p>That it nor grows with heat nor 1568 drowns with showers.</p>
<p>To this I witness 1569 call the fools 1570 of time 1571 ,</p>
<p>Which die for goodness 1572 , who have lived for crime.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>Were’t aught to me 1573 I bore the canopy 1574 ,</p>
<p>With my extern the outward honouring 1575 ,</p>
<p>Or laid great bases 1576 for eternity 1577 ,</p>
<p>Which 1578 proves more short than waste or ruining?</p>
<p>Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour 1579</p>
<p>Lose all and more, by paying too much rent 1580 ,</p>
<p>For compound sweet forgoing simple savour 1581 ,</p>
<p>Pitiful thrivers 1582 , in their gazing spent 1583 ?</p>
<p>No, let me be obsequious 1584 in thy heart,</p>
<p>And take thou my oblation 1585 , poor but free,</p>
<p>Which is not mixed with seconds 1586 , knows no art 1587 ,</p>
<p>But mutual render 1588 , only me for thee.</p>
<p>Hence, thou suborned informer 1589 , a true soul</p>
<p>When most impeached 1590 stands least in thy control.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power</p>
<p>Dost hold Time’s fickle glass 1591 , his sickle hour 1592 ,</p>
<p>Who hast by waning grown 1593 , and therein show’st</p>
<p>Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow’st —</p>
<p>If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack 1594 ,</p>
<p>As thou goest onwards 1595 , still will pluck thee back,</p>
<p>She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill</p>
<p>May Time disgrace 1596 and wretched minutes kill 1597 .</p>
<p>Yet fear her, O thou minion 1598 of her pleasure:</p>
<p>She may detain, but not still keep 1599 , her treasure.</p>
<p>Her audit 1600 , though delayed, answered 1601 must be,</p>
<p>And her quietus 1602 is to render 1603 thee.</p>
<p>( )</p>
<p>( ) 1604</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>In the old age 1605 black 1606 was not counted fair 1607 ,</p>
<p>Or if it were, it bore not beauty’s name 1608 .</p>
<p>But now is black beauty’s successive 1609 heir</p>
<p>And beauty slandered with a bastard shame 1610 :</p>
<p>For since each hand hath put on 1611 nature’s power,</p>
<p>Fairing the foul 1612 with art’s false borrowed face,</p>
<p>Sweet beauty hath no name 1613 , no holy bower,</p>
<p>But is profaned 1614 , if not lives in disgrace.</p>
<p>Therefore my mistress’ brows are raven black,</p>
<p>Her eyes so suited 1615 , and they mourners seem</p>
<p>At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack 1616 ,</p>
<p>Sland’ring creation with a false esteem 1617 .</p>
<p>Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe 1618 ,</p>
<p>That every tongue says beauty should look so.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>How oft, when thou, my music 1619 , music play’st</p>
<p>Upon that blessèd wood 1620 whose motion sounds 1621</p>
<p>With thy sweet fingers, when thou gently sway’st 1622</p>
<p>The wiry concord 1623 that mine ear confounds 1624 ,</p>
<p>Do I envy those jacks 1625 that nimble leap</p>
<p>To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,</p>
<p>Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest 1626 reap,</p>
<p>At the wood’s boldness by thee blushing stand.</p>
<p>To be so tickled, they would change their state</p>
<p>And situation with those dancing chips 1627</p>
<p>O’er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,</p>
<p>Making dead wood more blest than living lips.</p>
<p>Since saucy 1628 jacks so happy are in this,</p>
<p>Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>Th’expense 1629 of spirit 1630 in a waste of shame 1631</p>
<p>Is lust in action 1632 , and till action, lust</p>
<p>Is perjured 1633 , murd’rous, bloody, full of blame 1634 ,</p>
<p>Savage, extreme, rude 1635 , cruel, not to trust 1636 ,</p>
<p>Enjoyed no sooner but despisèd straight 1637 ,</p>
<p>Past reason 1638 hunted and, no sooner had,</p>
<p>Past reason hated as a swallowed bait</p>
<p>On purpose laid to make the taker mad,</p>
<p>Mad in pursuit and in possession so,</p>
<p>Had, having and in quest to have, extreme,</p>
<p>A bliss in proof 1639 and proved 1640 a very woe,</p>
<p>Before, a joy proposed 1641 — behind 1642 , a dream 1643 .</p>
<p>All this the world well knows, yet none knows well</p>
<p>To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell 1644 .</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun 1645 ,</p>
<p>Coral is far more red than her lips’ red,</p>
<p>If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun 1646 ,</p>
<p>If hairs be wires 1647 , black wires grow on her head.</p>
<p>I have seen roses damasked 1648 , red and white,</p>
<p>But no such roses see I in her cheeks,</p>
<p>And in some perfumes is there more delight</p>
<p>Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks 1649 .</p>
<p>I love to hear her speak, yet well I know</p>
<p>That music hath a far more pleasing sound.</p>
<p>I grant I never saw a goddess go 1650 :</p>
<p>My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.</p>
<p>And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare</p>
<p>As any she belied with false compare 1651 .</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>Thou art as tyrannous 1652 , so as thou art 1653 ,</p>
<p>As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel,</p>
<p>For well thou know’st to my dear 1654 doting heart</p>
<p>Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.</p>
<p>Yet in good faith 1655 some say, that thee behold,</p>
<p>Thy face hath not the power to make love groan 1656 .</p>
<p>To say they err I dare not be so bold,</p>
<p>Although I swear it to myself alone.</p>
<p>And to be sure that is not false I swear</p>
<p>A thousand groans but 1657 thinking on thy face</p>
<p>One on another’s neck 1658 do witness bear</p>
<p>Thy black 1659 is fairest 1660 in my judgement’s place 1661 .</p>
<p>In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,</p>
<p>And thence this slander 1662 as I think proceeds.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>Thine eyes I love and they, as pitying me,</p>
<p>Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,</p>
<p>Have put on black and loving mourners be,</p>
<p>Looking with pretty ruth 1663 upon my pain.</p>
<p>And truly not the morning 1664 sun of heaven</p>
<p>Better becomes 1665 the grey cheeks of the east,</p>
<p>Nor that full star 1666 that ushers in the even 1667</p>
<p>Doth half that glory to the sober 1668 west,</p>
<p>As those two mourning 1669 eyes become thy face:</p>
<p>O, let it then as well beseem 1670 thy heart</p>
<p>To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace 1671 ,</p>
<p>And suit thy pity like in every part 1672 .</p>
<p>Then will I swear beauty herself is black,</p>
<p>And all they foul 1673 that thy complexion lack.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>Beshrew 1674 that heart that makes my heart to groan</p>
<p>For that deep wound 1675 it gives my friend and me.</p>
<p>Is’t not enough to torture me alone,</p>
<p>But slave to slavery 1676 my sweet’st friend must be?</p>
<p>Me from myself thy cruel eye 1677 hath taken,</p>
<p>And my next self 1678 thou harder 1679 hast engrossed 1680 .</p>
<p>Of 1681 him, myself and thee, I am forsaken 1682 ,</p>
<p>A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed 1683 .</p>
<p>Prison 1684 my heart in thy steel bosom’s ward 1685 ,</p>
<p>But then my friend’s heart let my poor heart bail 1686 ,</p>
<p>Whoe’er keeps 1687 me, let my heart be his 1688 guard:</p>
<p>Thou canst not then use rigour 1689 in my jail.</p>
<p>And yet thou wilt, for I, being pent 1690 in thee,</p>
<p>Perforce am thine and all that is in me 1691 .</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>So, now I have confessed that he 1692 is thine,</p>
<p>And I myself am mortgaged to thy will 1693 ,</p>
<p>Myself I’ll forfeit, so that other mine 1694</p>
<p>Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still:</p>
<p>But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,</p>
<p>For thou art covetous and he is kind 1695 .</p>
<p>He learned but surety-like to write for me 1696</p>
<p>Under that bond 1697 that him as fast 1698 doth bind.</p>
<p>The statute 1699 of thy beauty thou wilt take,</p>
<p>Thou usurer 1700 , that put’st forth all to use 1701 ,</p>
<p>And sue 1702 a friend came debtor 1703 for my sake:</p>
<p>So him I lose through my unkind abuse 1704 .</p>
<p>Him have I lost, thou hast 1705 both him and me:</p>
<p>He pays the whole 1706 , and yet am I not free.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will 1707 ,</p>
<p>And Will to boot 1708 , and Will in overplus 1709 :</p>
<p>More than enough am I that vex 1710 thee still 1711 ,</p>
<p>To thy sweet will making addition 1712 thus.</p>
<p>Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious 1713 ,</p>
<p>Not once vouchsafe 1714 to hide my will in thine 1715 ?</p>
<p>Shall will in others seem right gracious 1716 ,</p>
<p>And in my will no fair acceptance shine 1717 ?</p>
<p>The sea all water, yet receives rain still</p>
<p>And in abundance addeth to his store.</p>
<p>So thou, being rich in Will 1718 , add to thy Will 1719</p>
<p>One will of mine 1720 , to make thy large Will more 1721 .</p>
<p>Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill 1722 :</p>
<p>Think all but one and me in that one Will 1723 .</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>If thy soul check 1724 thee that I come so near 1725 ,</p>
<p>Swear to thy blind 1726 soul that I was thy Will 1727 ,</p>
<p>And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there 1728 :</p>
<p>Thus far for love 1729 my love-suit 1730 , sweet, fulfil.</p>
<p>Will 1731 will fulfil 1732 the treasure of thy love 1733 ,</p>
<p>Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one 1734 .</p>
<p>In things of great receipt 1735 with ease we prove</p>
<p>Among a number one is reckoned none.</p>
<p>Then in the number let me pass untold 1736 ,</p>
<p>Though in thy store’s account 1737 I one must be:</p>
<p>For nothing hold me 1738 , so 1739 it please thee hold 1740</p>
<p>That nothing me 1741 , a something 1742 sweet to thee.</p>
<p>Make but 1743 my name 1744 thy love and love that still 1745 ,</p>
<p>And then thou lovest me, for my name is Will.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>Thou blind 1746 fool, love, what dost thou to mine eyes,</p>
<p>That they behold and see not what they see?</p>
<p>They know what beauty is, see where it lies 1747 ,</p>
<p>Yet what the be 1748 st is take the worst to be.</p>
<p>If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks 1749</p>
<p>Be anchored in the bay 1750 where all men ride 1751 ,</p>
<p>Why of eyes’ falsehood hast thou forgèd hooks,</p>
<p>Whereto the judgement of my heart is tied?</p>
<p>Why should my heart think that a several plot 1752</p>
<p>Which my heart knows the wide world’s common place 1753 ?</p>
<p>Or 1754 mine eyes seeing this, say this is not 1755 ,</p>
<p>To 1756 put fair truth upon so foul a face?</p>
<p>In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,</p>
<p>And to this false plague 1757 are they now transferred.</p>
<p>138 1758</p>
<p>When my love swears that she is made of truth 1759 ,</p>
<p>I do believe her, though I know she lies 1760 ,</p>
<p>That 1761 she might think me some untutored youth,</p>
<p>Unlearnèd in the world’s false subtleties 1762 .</p>
<p>Thus vainly 1763 thinking that she thinks me young,</p>
<p>Although she knows my days are past the best,</p>
<p>Simply 1764 I credit 1765 her false-speaking tongue:</p>
<p>On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.</p>
<p>But wherefore 1766 says she not she is unjust 1767 ?</p>
<p>And wherefore say not I that I am old?</p>
<p>O, love’s best habit 1768 is in seeming 1769 trust,</p>
<p>And age in love loves not to have years told 1770 .</p>
<p>Therefore I lie 1771 with her and she with me,</p>
<p>And in our faults by lies we flattered 1772 be.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>O, call not me to justify the wrong</p>
<p>That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,</p>
<p>Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue 1773 ,</p>
<p>Use power with power 1774 and slay me not by art 1775 ,</p>
<p>Tell me thou lov’st elsewhere, but in my sight,</p>
<p>Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside.</p>
<p>What need’st thou wound with cunning when thy might 1776</p>
<p>Is more than my o’erpressed 1777 defence can bide 1778 ?</p>
<p>Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows</p>
<p>Her pretty looks 1779 have been mine enemies,</p>
<p>And therefore from my face she turns my foes,</p>
<p>That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:</p>
<p>Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,</p>
<p>Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press 1780</p>
<p>My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,</p>
<p>Lest sorrow lend me words and words express</p>
<p>The manner of my pity-wanting pain 1781 .</p>
<p>If I might teach thee wit 1782 , better it were,</p>
<p>Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so,</p>
<p>As testy 1783 sick men, when their deaths be near,</p>
<p>No news but health from their physicians know 1784 .</p>
<p>For if I should despair, I should grow mad,</p>
<p>And in my madness might speak ill of thee.</p>
<p>Now this ill-wresting world 1785 is grown so 1786 bad,</p>
<p>Mad slanderers by mad ears believèd be.</p>
<p>That I may not be so, nor thou belied 1787 ,</p>
<p>Bear thine eyes straight 1788 , though thy proud heart go wide 1789
.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,</p>
<p>For they in thee a thousand errors 1790 note,</p>
<p>But ’tis my heart that loves what they despise,</p>
<p>Who in despite of 1791 view is pleased to dote.</p>
<p>Nor are mine ears with thy tongue’s tune delighted,</p>
<p>Nor tender feeling to base touches 1792 prone,</p>
<p>Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited</p>
<p>To any sensual feast 1793 with thee alone.</p>
<p>But my five wits 1794 nor my five senses can</p>
<p>Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,</p>
<p>Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man 1795 ,</p>
<p>Thy proud heart’s slave and vassal 1796 wretch to be:</p>
<p>Only my plague 1797 thus far I count my gain,</p>
<p>That she that makes me sin awards me pain 1798 .</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>Love is my sin and thy dear 1799 virtue hate,</p>
<p>Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful 1800 loving.</p>
<p>O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,</p>
<p>And thou shalt find it merits 1801 not reproving,</p>
<p>Or if it do, not from those lips of thine</p>
<p>That have profaned 1802 their scarlet ornaments</p>
<p>And sealed 1803 false bonds of love as oft as mine,</p>
<p>Robbed others’ beds’ revenues of their rents 1804 .</p>
<p>Be it 1805 lawful I love thee, as thou lov’st those</p>
<p>Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune 1806 thee.</p>
<p>Root 1807 pity in thy heart, that when it grows,</p>
<p>Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.</p>
<p>If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide 1808 ,</p>
<p>By self-example 1809 mayst thou be denied.</p>

<p>Lo, as a careful 1810 housewife runs to catch</p>
<p>One of her feathered creatures 1811 broke away 1812 ,</p>
<p>Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch 1813</p>
<p>In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,</p>
<p>Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase 1814 ,</p>
<p>Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent</p>
<p>To follow that which flies before her face,</p>
<p>Not prizing 1815 her poor infant’s discontent:</p>
<p>So runn’st thou after that which flies from thee,</p>
<p>Whilst I, thy babe, chase thee afar behind.</p>
<p>But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,</p>
<p>And play the mother’s part, kiss me, be kind 1816 .</p>
<p>So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will 1817 ,</p>
<p>If thou turn back and my loud crying still 1818 .</p>
<p>144 1819</p>
<p>Two loves 1820 I have of comfort and despair,</p>
<p>Which like two spirits do suggest 1821 me still 1822 :</p>
<p>The better angel is a man right fair 1823 ,</p>
<p>The worser spirit a woman coloured ill 1824 .</p>
<p>To win me soon to hell, my female evil</p>
<p>Tempteth my better angel from my side</p>
<p>And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,</p>
<p>Wooing his purity with her foul pride 1825 .</p>
<p>And whether that my angel be turned fiend 1826</p>
<p>Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;</p>
<p>But being both from me 1827 , both to each friend 1828 ,</p>
<p>I guess one angel in another’s hell 1829 .</p>
<p>Yet this shall I ne’er know, but live in doubt,</p>
<p>Till my bad angel fire my good one out 1830 .</p>
<p>145 1831</p>
<p>Those lips that Love’s own hand did make</p>
<p>Breathed forth the sound that said ‘I hate’</p>
<p>To me that languished for her sake.</p>
<p>But when she saw my woeful state,</p>
<p>Straight 1832 in her heart did mercy come,</p>
<p>Chiding that tongue that ever sweet</p>
<p>Was used in giving gentle doom 1833 ,</p>
<p>And 1834 taught it thus anew to greet:</p>
<p>‘I hate’ she altered with an end</p>
<p>That followed it as gentle day</p>
<p>Doth follow night, who like a fiend</p>
<p>From heaven to hell is flown away.</p>
<p>‘I hate’ from hate away she threw</p>
<p>And saved my life, saying ‘not you’.</p>
<p>146 1835</p>
<p>Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,</p>
<p>[ ] these rebel powers 1836 that thee array 1837 ,</p>
<p>Why dost thou pine 1838 within and suffer dearth 1839 ,</p>
<p>Painting thy outward walls so costly gay 1840 ?</p>
<p>Why so large cost, having so short a lease,</p>
<p>Dost thou upon thy fading mansion 1841 spend?</p>
<p>Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,</p>
<p>Eat up thy charge 1842 ? Is this thy body’s end?</p>
<p>Then, soul, live thou upon thy servant 1843 ’s loss</p>
<p>And let that pine to aggravate 1844 thy store,</p>
<p>Buy terms divine 1845 in selling hours of dross 1846 ,</p>
<p>Within be fed, without 1847 be rich no more:</p>
<p>So shalt thou feed on death 1848 , that feeds on men,</p>
<p>And death once dead, there’s no more dying then.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>My love is as a fever, longing still 1849</p>
<p>For that which longer nurseth 1850 the disease,</p>
<p>Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill 1851 ,</p>
<p>Th’uncertain 1852 sickly appetite 1853 to please.</p>
<p>My reason, the physician to my love,</p>
<p>Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,</p>
<p>Hath left me and I desperate now approve 1854</p>
<p>Desire is death 1855 , which physic did except 1856 .</p>
<p>Past cure I am, now reason is past care 1857 ;</p>
<p>And frantic-mad with evermore 1858 unrest,</p>
<p>My thoughts and my discourse as madmen’s are,</p>
<p>At random from the truth 1859 vainly 1860 expressed.</p>
<p>For I have sworn thee fair 1861 and thought thee bright,</p>
<p>Who art as black 1862 as hell, as dark as night.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>O me, what eyes hath love 1863 put in my head,</p>
<p>Which have no correspondence with true sight,</p>
<p>Or if they have, where is my judgement fled</p>
<p>That censures falsely 1864 what they see aright?</p>
<p>If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,</p>
<p>What means the world to say it is not so?</p>
<p>If it be not, then love doth well denote</p>
<p>Love’s eye 1865 is not so true as all men’s ‘no’.</p>
<p>How can it? O, how can love’s eye be true,</p>
<p>That is so vexed 1866 with watching 1867 and with tears?</p>
<p>No marvel then though 1868 I mistake my view 1869 :</p>
<p>The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.</p>
<p>O cunning love, with tears thou keep’st me blind,</p>
<p>Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults 1870 should find.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not,</p>
<p>When I against myself with thee partake 1871 ?</p>
<p>Do I not think on thee, when I forgot</p>
<p>Am of 1872 myself, all tyrant 1873 for thy sake?</p>
<p>Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?</p>
<p>On whom frown’st thou that I do fawn upon?</p>
<p>Nay, if thou lour’st 1874 on me, do I not spend 1875</p>
<p>Revenge upon myself with present moan 1876 ?</p>
<p>What merit do I in myself respect 1877 ,</p>
<p>That is so proud thy service to despise 1878 ,</p>
<p>When all my best doth worship thy defect 1879 ,</p>
<p>Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?</p>
<p>But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind:</p>
<p>Those that can see thou lov’st 1880 , and I am blind.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>O, from what power hast thou this powerful might</p>
<p>With insufficiency 1881 my heart to sway 1882 ,</p>
<p>To make me give the lie to 1883 my true sight</p>
<p>And swear that brightness doth not grace the day 1884 ?</p>
<p>Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill 1885 ,</p>
<p>That in the very refuse of thy deeds 1886</p>
<p>There is such strength and warrantize 1887 of skill</p>
<p>That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?</p>
<p>Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,</p>
<p>The more I hear and see just cause of hate?</p>
<p>O, though I love what others do abhor 1888 ,</p>
<p>With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.</p>
<p>If thy unworthiness raised love in me,</p>
<p>More worthy I to be beloved of thee.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>Love is too young 1889 to know what conscience 1890 is,</p>
<p>Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?</p>
<p>Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss 1891 ,</p>
<p>Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.</p>
<p>For, thou betraying me 1892 , I do betray</p>
<p>My nobler part 1893 to my gross 1894 body’s treason 1895 .</p>
<p>My soul doth tell my body that he may</p>
<p>Triumph in love: flesh stays no further reason 1896 ,</p>
<p>But rising 1897 at thy name doth point out thee</p>
<p>As his triumphant prize 1898 . Proud of this pride 1899 ,</p>
<p>He is contented thy poor drudge 1900 to be,</p>
<p>To stand in thy affairs, fall 1901 by thy side.</p>
<p>No want 1902 of conscience hold 1903 it that I call</p>
<p>Her ‘love’ for whose dear love I rise and fall.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>In loving thee thou know’st I am forsworn 1904 ,</p>
<p>But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing 1905 :</p>
<p>In act 1906 thy bed-vow 1907 broke and new faith torn</p>
<p>In vowing new hate after new love bearing 1908 .</p>
<p>But why of two oaths’ breach do I accuse thee,</p>
<p>When I break twenty? I am perjured most,</p>
<p>For all my vows are oaths but to misuse 1909 thee,</p>
<p>And all my honest faith in thee is lost.</p>
<p>For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness 1910 ,</p>
<p>Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,</p>
<p>And to enlighten 1911 thee gave eyes to blindness,</p>
<p>Or made them swear against the thing they see.</p>
<p>For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured eye 1912 ,</p>
<p>To swear against the truth so foul 1913 a lie.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>Cupid 1914 laid by his brand and fell asleep.</p>
<p>A maid of Dian 1915 ’s this advantage found,</p>
<p>And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep 1916</p>
<p>In a cold valley-fountain of that ground 1917 ,</p>
<p>Which borrowed from this holy fire of love</p>
<p>A dateless 1918 lively heat, still to endure 1919 ,</p>
<p>And grew 1920 a seething bath, which yet men prove 1921</p>
<p>Against strange 1922 maladies a sovereign 1923 cure.</p>
<p>But at my mistress’ eye love’s brand new-fired 1924 ,</p>
<p>The boy 1925 for trial 1926 needs would 1927 touch my breast 1928
.</p>
<p>I, sick withal 1929 , the help of bath 1930 desired,</p>
<p>And thither hied 1931 , a sad distempered 1932 guest,</p>
<p>But found no cure: the bath for my help lies</p>
<p>Where Cupid got new fire — my mistress’ eyes.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>The little Love-god 1933 lying once asleep</p>
<p>Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand 1934 ,</p>
<p>Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep</p>
<p>Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand</p>
<p>The fairest votary 1935 took up that fire</p>
<p>Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,</p>
<p>And so the general 1936 of hot desire</p>
<p>Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarmed.</p>
<p>This brand she quenched in a cool well by,</p>
<p>Which from love’s fire took heat perpetual,</p>
<p>Growing a bath and healthful remedy</p>
<p>For men diseased 1937 : but I, my mistress’ thrall 1938 ,</p>
<p>Came there for cure, and this by that I prove:</p>
<p>Love’s fire heats water, water cools not love.</p>

<p>NOTES</p>
<p>1 BEGETTER creator, father, author; could possibly mean
‘inspirer’</p>
<p>2 MR. W. H. often assumed to be the young man addressed in Sonnets
1–126, he has been variously identified – the most likely candidates are
Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton (to whom Venus and Adonis and
Lucrece were dedicated) and William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke (to whom
the First Folio was dedicated); however, MR. does not suggest an
aristocrat, so it is possible that W. H. is a misprint for ‘W. S.’, and
that this is the publisher’s dedication to the author</p>
<p>3 ETERNITY immortality</p>
<p>4 OUR EVER-LIVING POET Shakespeare (if a certain W. H. is the
dedicatee)/God, via a pun on poet as ‘maker’ (if ‘W. H.’ should actually

not having children)</p>
<p>13 eyes perhaps puns on ‘I’s’</p>

<p>17 gaudy bright (without connotations of vulgarity)</p>
<p>18 bud an image of youth, also of virginity; may additionally refer
to the glans of the penis</p>
<p>19 content happiness/contents (i.e. potential children)</p>
<p>20 tender churl a paradox: he is both loving/sensitive (tender ) and
mean/boorish (a churl )</p>
<p>21 mak’st waste wastes/lays waste, destroys</p>
<p>22 niggarding being mean, stingy; another paradox – he wastes by
being sparing</p>
<p>23 the world’s due what he owes the world (children)</p>
<p>24 by … thee i.e. his potential children are eaten twice: by his
self-absorption and by the grave that will bury him</p>

beauty will become a battlefield full of trenches (wrinkles)</p>
<p>27 proud livery splendid uniform (of a nobleman’s servant or a
soldier)</p>
<p>28 weed garment/wild plant</p>
<p>29 treasure may play on the sense of ‘semen’</p>

<p>31 all-eating shame gluttonous shame that totally consumes one</p>
<p>32 thriftless unprofitable</p>

<p>USER’S GUIDE</p>
<p>Titles follow the First Folio, where there are sometimes minor
variations of nomenclature between contents list, title at head of play
and running header – our default preference is the title at the head of
the play (thus, for example, Love’s Labour’s Lost and The Tragedy of
Cymbeline as opposed to the contents list’s Love’s Labour Lost and
Cymbeline King of Britain) . Some of the plays were originally staged
with different titles (e.g. The Second Part of Henry the Sixth began its
life as The First Part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses
of York and Lancaster, and Henry the Eighth seems to have been called
All is True ).</p>
<p>Lists of Parts are supplied in the First Folio for only six plays, so
these are predominantly editorial, arranged by groups of character (thus
for A Midsummer Night’s Dream , the court, the genteel lovers, the
artisans, the fairies). Capitals indicate that part of the name which is
used for speech headings in the script (thus ‘PROSPERO , the right Duke
of Milan’ and ‘Sir John FALSTAFF’).</p>
<p>Locations are provided by the Folio for only two plays (The Tempest
is set on ‘an uninhabited island’ and Measure for Measure in Vienna).
Eighteenth-century editors, working in an age of elaborately realistic
stage sets, were the first to provide detailed locations. Given that
Shakespeare wrote for a bare stage and often an imprecise sense of
place, we have relegated locations to the explanatory notes at the foot
of the page, where they are given at the beginning of each scene where
the imaginary location is different from the one before. We have
emphasized broad geographical settings rather than specifics of the kind
that suggest anachronistically realistic staging. Thus Sicilia and
Bohemia or court and country in The Winter’s Tale , Venice and Cyprus in
Othello, not usually such locations as ‘another room in the palace’.
Indications of movement from outdoors to indoors are given where
appropriate.</p>
<p>Act and Scene Divisions were provided in the Folio (they were absent
from the Quartos published in Shakespeare’s lifetime). Sometimes,
however, they were erroneous or omitted; corrections and additions
supplied by editorial tradition are indicated by square brackets.
Five-act division is based on a classical model, and act breaks provided
the opportunity to replace the candles in the indoor Blackfriars
playhouse which the King’s Men used after 1608, but Shakespeare did not
necessarily think in terms of a five-part structure of dramatic
composition. The Folio convention is that a scene ends when the stage is
empty. Nowadays, partly under the influence of film, we tend to consider
a scene to be a dramatic unit that ends with either a change of
imaginary location or a significant passage of time within the
narrative. Shakespeare’s fluidity of composition accords well with this
convention, so in addition to act and scene numbers we provide a running
scene count at the beginning of each new scene. Where there is a scene
break caused by a momentary bare stage, but the location does not change
and extra time does not pass, we use the convention running scene
continues . There is inevitably a degree of editorial judgement in
making such calls, but the system is very valuable in suggesting the
pace of the plays (it reveals, for instance, the great compression of
Othello ).</p>
<p>Speaker’s Names are often inconsistent in Folio. We have regularized
speech headings, but retained an element of deliberate inconsistency in
entry directions, in order to give the flavour of Folio.</p>
<p>Verse is indicated by lines that do not run to the right margin and
by capitalization of the first letter of each line. The Folio printers
sometimes set verse as prose, and vice versa (either out of
misunderstanding or for reasons of space). We have silently corrected in
such cases, although in some instances there is ambiguity, in which case
we have leaned towards the preservation of Folio layout. Folio sometimes
uses contraction (‘turnd’ rather than ‘turned’) to indicate whether or
not the final ‘-ed’ of a past participle is sounded, an area where there
is variation for the sake of the five-beat iambic pentameter rhythm. We
use the convention of a grave accent to indicate sounding (thus ‘turnèd’
would be two syllables), but would urge actors not to overstress. In
cases where one speaker ends with a verse half-line and the next begins
with the other half of the pentameter, editors since the late eighteenth
century have indented the second line. We have abandoned this
convention, since the Folio does not use it, and nor did actors’ cues in
the Shakespearean theatre. An exception is made when the second speaker
actively interrupts or completes the first speaker’s sentence.</p>
<p>Spelling is modernized, but older forms are occasionally maintained
where necessary for rhythm or aural effect. For instance, ‘y’are’ is
generally modernized to ‘you’re’, but the old form is retained in
Regan’s ‘I know you are of her bosom … Y’are. I know’t.’</p>
<p>Punctuation in Shakespeare’s time was as much rhetorical as
grammatical. ‘Colon’ was originally a term for a unit of thought in an
argument. The semi-colon was a new unit of punctuation (some of the
Quartos lack them altogether). We have modernized punctuation
throughout, but have given more weight to Folio punctuation than many
editors, since, though not Shakespearean, it reflects the usage of his
period. In particular, we have used the colon far more than many
editors: it is exceptionally useful as a way of indicating the way in
which many Shakespearean speeches unfold clause by clause in a
developing argument that gives the illusion of enacting the process of
thinking in the moment. We have also kept in mind the origin of
punctuation in classical times as a means of assisting the actor and
orator: the comma suggests the briefest of pauses for breath, the colon
a middling one and a full stop or period a longer pause. Semi-colons, by
contrast, belong to an era of punctuation that was only just coming in
during Shakespeare’s time and that is coming to an end now: we have
accordingly only used them where they occur in our copy-texts (and not
always then). Dashes are sometimes used for parenthetical interjections
where the Folio has brackets. They are also used for interruptions and
changes in train of thought. Where a change of addressee occurs within a
speech, we have used a dash preceded by a full stop (or occasionally
another form of punctuation). Often the identity of the respective
addressees is obvious from the context. When it is not, this has been
indicated in a marginal stage direction.</p>
<p>Entrances and Exits are fairly thorough in Folio, which has
accordingly been followed as faithfully as possible. Where characters
are omitted or corrections are necessary, this is indicated by square
brackets (e.g. ‘[and Attendants ]’). Exit is sometimes silently
normalized to Exeunt and Manet anglicized to ‘remains’. We trust Folio
positioning of entrances and exits to a greater degree than most
editors: thus, for instance, we follow Folio in having the other
characters enter in the middle of Petruchio’s speech to Kate at Taming
of the Shrew , 2.1.268–81, making the latter part of the speech into a
kind of game for the benefit of the onstage audience (an interpretation
that strongly shaped Greg Doran’s RSC production).</p>
<p>Other Stage Directions such as stage business, asides and indications
of addressee are rare in Folio. Modern editions usually mingle editorial
directions with original Folio and Quarto ones, sometimes marking
interventions by means of square brackets. We have sought to distinguish
what could be described as directorial interventions of this kind from
Folio-style directions (either original or supplied) by placing the
former in the right margin in a different typeface. There is a degree of
subjectivity about which directions are of which kind, but the procedure
is intended as a reminder to the reader and the actor that Shakespearean
stage directions are often dependent upon editorial inference alone and
are not set in stone. We also depart from editorial tradition in
sometimes admitting uncertainty and thus printing permissive stage
directions, such as an Aside ?(often a line may be equally effective as
an aside or a direct address – it is for each production or reading to
make its own decision) or a may exit or a piece of business placed
between arrows to indicate that it may occur at various different
moments within a scene.</p>
<p>Explanatory Notes at the foot of each page explain allusions and
gloss obsolete and difficult words, confusing phraseology, occasional
major textual cruces, and so on. Particular attention is given to
non-standard usage, bawdy innuendo and technical terms (e.g. legal and
military language). Where more than one sense is given, commas indicate
shades of related meaning, slashes alternative or double meanings.</p>
<p>Textual Notes at the end of each play indicate major departures from
the Folio. They take the following form: the reading of our text is
given in bold and its source given after an equals sign, with ‘Q’
indicating that it derives from the principal Quarto and ‘Ed’ that it
derives from the editorial tradition. The rejected Folio (‘F’) reading
is then given. A selection of Quarto variants and plausible unadopted
editorial readings are also included. Thus, for example, at Hamlet ,
3.4.180, ’ bloat = Ed. F = blunt. Q = blowt’, indicates that we have
adopted the editorial reading’bloat’ where Folio has ‘blunt’ and Quarto
has ‘blowt’.</p>
<p>‘Key Facts’ boxes at the beginning of each work give information on
plot, sources, proportion of verse and prose, textual issues, authorial
attribution when doubtful or collaborative, date of composition and
first performance. They also include lists of substantial parts
(characters who speak more than about forty lines) in descending order
of size. Since the definition of a line spoken is variable (because of
prose and half-lines), figures are given in terms of a percentage of the
whole, the number of speeches delivered and the number of scenes the
character is onstage. These lists make it possible to distinguish
between works that are more ensemble-based (e.g. A Midsummer Night’s
Dream and 2 Henry IV ) and those that are dominated by a small number of
characters (e.g. Othello and 1 Henry IV ). Though there is a degree of
imprecision about these lists as a result of editorial interventions,
they offer much valuable information – for instance that Sir Toby Belch
has the largest part in Twelfth Night and that only six lead characters
so dominate their world that their part is over three times the length
of anyone else’s in the play (Hamlet, Richard III, Timon, Macbeth,
Prospero, Henry V).</p>
