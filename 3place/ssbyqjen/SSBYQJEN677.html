11</h4>
<p>Enter, with Drum and Colours, Bullingbrook, York, Northumberland [and
] Attendants</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK So that 783 by this intelligence we learn</p>
<p>The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury</p>
<p>Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed</p>
<p>With some few private friends upon this coast.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND The news is very fair and good, my lord.</p>
<p>Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.</p>
<p>YORK It would beseem 784 the Lord Northumberland</p>
<p>To say ‘King Richard’. Alack the heavy day</p>
<p>When such a sacred king should hide his head.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Your grace mistakes. Only to 785 be brief</p>
<p>Left I his title out.</p>
<p>YORK The time hath been,</p>
<p>Would you have been so brief with him, he would</p>
<p>Have been so brief with you to shorten you,</p>
<p>For taking so the head 786 , your 787 whole head’s length.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Mistake 788 not, uncle, further than you should.</p>
<p>YORK Take 789 not, good cousin, further than you should,</p>
<p>Lest you mistake 790 the heavens are o’er your head.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself</p>
<p>Against their will. But who comes here?</p>
<p>Enter Percy</p>
<p>Welcome, Harry. What, will not this castle yield?</p>
<p>PERCY The castle royally is manned, my lord,</p>
<p>Against thy entrance.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Royally? Why, it contains no king?</p>
<p>PERCY Yes, my good lord,</p>
<p>It doth contain a king: King Richard lies 791</p>
<p>Within the limits of yond lime and stone,</p>
<p>And with him the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,</p>
<p>Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman</p>
<p>Of holy reverence, who 792 , I cannot learn.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND O, belike 793 it is the Bishop of Carlisle.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Noble lord,</p>
<p>Go to the rude 794 ribs 795 of that ancient castle.</p>
<p>Through brazen 796 trumpet send the breath of parle 797</p>
<p>Into his 798 ruined 799 ears, and thus deliver:</p>
<p>Henry Bullingbrook</p>
<p>Upon his knees doth kiss King Richard’s hand</p>
<p>And sends allegiance and true faith of heart</p>
<p>To his most royal person, hither come</p>
<p>Even at his feet to lay my arms and power</p>
<p>Provided that my banishment repealed</p>
<p>And lands restored again 800 be freely granted.</p>
<p>If not, I’ll use th’advantage of my power 801</p>
<p>And lay 802 the summer’s dust with showers of blood</p>
<p>Rained from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen;</p>
<p>The which, how far off from the mind of Bullingbrook</p>
<p>It is, such 803 crimson tempest should bedrench 804</p>
<p>The fresh green lap of fair King Richard’s land,</p>
<p>My stooping duty tenderly 805 shall show.</p>
<p>Go signify as much, while here we march</p>
<p>Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.</p>
<p>Let’s march without the noise of threat’ning drum,</p>
<p>That from this castle’s tattered 806 battlements</p>
<p>Our fair appointments 807 may be well perused.</p>
<p>Methinks King Richard and myself should meet</p>
<p>With no less terror than the elements</p>
<p>Of fire and water 808 , when their thund’ring smoke</p>
<p>At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.</p>
<p>Be he the fire, I’ll be the yielding water;</p>
<p>The rage be his, while on the earth I rain 809</p>
<p>My waters on the earth, and not on him.</p>
<p>March on, and mark 810 King Richard how he looks.</p>
<p>Parley 811 without, and answer within. Then a flourish. Enter on the
walls, Richard, Carlisle, Aumerle, Scroop [and ] Salisbury</p>
<p>See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,</p>
<p>As doth the blushing 812 discontented sun</p>
<p>From out the fiery portal of the east,</p>
<p>When he perceives the envious 813 clouds are bent</p>
<p>To dim his glory and to stain 814 the tract 815</p>
<p>Of his bright passage to the occident 816 .</p>
<p>YORK Yet looks he like a king. Behold, his eye,</p>
<p>As bright as is the eagle’s, lightens forth 817</p>
<p>Controlling majesty. Alack, alack, for woe,</p>
<p>That any harm should stain so fair a show!</p>
<p>KING RICHARD We are amazed 818 ; and thus long have we stood</p>
<p>To Northumberland</p>
<p>To watch 819 the fearful 820 bending of thy knee</p>
<p>Because we thought ourself thy lawful 821 king.</p>
<p>And if we be, how dare thy joints forget</p>
<p>To pay their awful duty to our presence?</p>
<p>If we be not, show us the hand 822 of God</p>
<p>That hath dismissed us from our stewardship,</p>
<p>For well we know, no hand of blood and bone</p>
<p>Can grip the sacred handle of our sceptre,</p>
<p>Unless he do profane 823 , steal, or usurp.</p>
<p>And though you think that all, as you have done,</p>
<p>Have torn 824 their souls by turning them from us 825 ,</p>
<p>And we are barren and bereft of friends,</p>
<p>Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,</p>
<p>Is must’ring in his clouds on our behalf</p>
<p>Armies of pestilence, and they shall strike 826</p>
<p>Your children yet unborn and unbegot 827 ,</p>
<p>That 828 lift your vassal 829 hands against my head</p>
<p>And threat the glory of my precious crown.</p>
<p>Tell Bullingbrook —— for yond methinks he is ——</p>
<p>That every stride he makes upon my land</p>
<p>Is dangerous treason. He is come to ope 830</p>
<p>The purple testament 831 of bleeding war;</p>
<p>But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,</p>
<p>Ten thousand bloody crowns 832 of mothers’ sons</p>
<p>Shall ill become the flower of England’s face,</p>
<p>Change the complexion of her maid-pale 833 peace</p>
<p>To scarlet indignation and bedew</p>
<p>Her pastor’s 834 grass with faithful English blood.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND The king of heaven forbid our lord the king</p>
<p>Should so with civil 835 and uncivil 836 arms</p>
<p>Be rushed upon! Thy thrice-noble cousin,</p>
<p>Harry Bullingbrook, doth humbly kiss thy hand.</p>
<p>And by the honourable tomb he swears,</p>
<p>That stands upon your royal grandsire’s bones,</p>
<p>And by the royalties of both your bloods ——</p>
<p>Currents that spring from one most gracious head 837 ——</p>
<p>And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,</p>
<p>And by the worth and honour of himself,</p>
<p>Comprising all that may be sworn or said,</p>
<p>His coming hither hath no further scope 838</p>
<p>Than for his lineal royalties 839 and to beg</p>
<p>Enfranchisement 840 immediate on his knees,</p>
<p>Which on thy royal party 841 granted once,</p>
<p>His glittering arms he will commend 842 to rust,</p>
<p>His barbèd 843 steeds to stables, and his heart</p>
<p>To faithful service of your majesty.</p>
<p>This swears he, as he is 844 a prince, is just:</p>
<p>And, as I am a gentleman, I credit 845 him.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Northumberland, say thus the king returns 846 .</p>
<p>His noble cousin is right welcome hither,</p>
<p>And all the number of his fair demands</p>
<p>Shall be accomplished 847 without contradiction.</p>
<p>With all the gracious 848 utterance thou hast,</p>
<p>Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends 849 .——</p>
<p>We do debase ourself, cousin, do we not,</p>
<p>To Aumerle</p>
<p>To look so poorly 850 and to speak so fair?</p>
<p>Shall we call back Northumberland, and send</p>
<p>Defiance to the traitor, and so die?</p>
<p>AUMERLE No, good my lord, let’s fight with gentle words</p>
<p>Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD O God, O God, that e’er 851 this tongue of mine,</p>
<p>That laid the sentence of dread banishment</p>
<p>On yond 852 proud man, should take it off again</p>
<p>With words of sooth 853 ! O, that I were as great</p>
<p>As is my grief, or lesser than my name!</p>
<p>Or that I could forget what I have been,</p>
<p>Or not remember what I must be now!</p>
<p>Swell’st thou, proud heart? I’ll give thee scope 854 to beat 855
,</p>
<p>Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.</p>
<p>AUMERLE Northumberland comes back from Bullingbrook.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD What must the king do now? Must he submit?</p>
<p>The king shall do it. Must he be deposed?</p>
<p>The king shall be contented 856 . Must he lose</p>
<p>The name of king? O’God’s name, let it go.</p>
<p>I’ll give my jewels for a set of beads 857 ,</p>
<p>My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,</p>
<p>My gay apparel for an almsman 858 ’s gown,</p>
<p>My figured 859 goblets for a dish of wood,</p>
<p>My sceptre for a palmer’s 860 walking staff,</p>
<p>My subjects for a pair of carvèd saints,</p>
<p>And my large kingdom for a little grave,</p>
<p>A little little grave, an obscure grave.</p>
<p>Or I’ll be buried in the king’s highway,</p>
<p>Some way of common trade 861 , where subjects’ feet</p>
<p>May hourly trample on their sovereign’s head,</p>
<p>For on my heart they tread now whilst I live,</p>
<p>And buried once 862 , why not upon my head?——</p>
<p>Aumerle, thou weep’st, my tender-hearted cousin!</p>
<p>We’ll make foul weather with despisèd 863 tears,</p>
<p>Our sighs and they shall lodge 864 the summer corn,</p>
<p>And make a dearth 865 in this revolting 866 land.</p>
<p>Or shall we play the wantons 867 with our woes,</p>
<p>And make 868 some pretty match 869 with shedding tears?</p>
<p>As thus, to drop them still 870 upon one place,</p>
<p>Till they have fretted us 871 a pair of graves</p>
<p>Within the earth, and, therein laid —— there lies</p>
<p>Two kinsmen digged their graves with weeping eyes.</p>
<p>Would not this ill 872 do well?—— Well, well, I see</p>
<p>I talk but idly, and you mock at me.——</p>
<p>Most mighty prince, my lord Northumberland,</p>
<p>What says King Bullingbrook? Will his majesty</p>
<p>Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?</p>
<p>You make a leg 873 , and Bullingbrook says ‘Ay’.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND My lord, in the base court 874 he doth attend 875</p>
<p>To speak with you. May it please you to come down?</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Down, down I come, like glist’ring 876 Phaethon 877
,</p>
<p>Wanting the manage 878 of unruly jades 879 .</p>
<p>In the base court? Base court where kings grow base,</p>
<p>To come at traitors’ calls and do them grace 880 .</p>
<p>In the base court, come down: down court, down king,</p>
<p>For night-owls shriek 881 where mounting larks should sing.</p>
<p>[Exeunt from above ]</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK What says his majesty?</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Sorrow and grief of heart</p>
<p>Makes him speak fondly 882 , like a frantic 883 man</p>
<p>Yet he is come.</p>
<p>[Enter King Richard and his Attendants below ]</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Stand all apart 884 ,</p>
<p>And show fair duty to his majesty.</p>
<p>My gracious lord——</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Fair cousin, you debase 885 your princely knee</p>
<p>To make the base earth proud with kissing it.</p>
<p>Me rather had 886 my heart might feel your love</p>
<p>Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy 887 .</p>
<p>Up, cousin, up 888 ! Your heart is up, I know,</p>
<p>Thus high at least, although your knee be low.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK So far be mine, my most redoubted 889 lord,</p>
<p>As my true service shall deserve your love.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Well you deserved. They well deserve to have,</p>
<p>That know the strong’st and surest way to get.——</p>
<p>Bullingbrook rises</p>
<p>Uncle, give me your hand: nay, dry your eyes.</p>
<p>To York</p>
<p>Tears show their love, but want their remedies 890 .——</p>
<p>Cousin, I am too young to be your father,</p>
<p>To Bullingbrook</p>
<p>Though you are old enough to be my heir.</p>
<p>What you will have, I’ll give, and willing 891 too,</p>
<p>For do we must what force will have us do.</p>
<p>Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Yea, my good lord.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Then I must not say no.</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt</p>
