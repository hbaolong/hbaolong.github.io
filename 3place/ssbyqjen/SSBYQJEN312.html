<h4 id="scene-3-283-running-scene-3">Scene 3 283 / running scene 3</h4>
<p>Sennet 284 . Enter Agamemnon, Nestor, Ulysses, Diomedes, Menelaus,
with others</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Princes,</p>
<p>What grief 285 hath set the jaundice 286 on your cheeks?</p>
<p>The ample proposition 287 that hope makes</p>
<p>In all designs begun on earth below 288</p>
<p>Fails in the promised largeness 289 : checks 290 and disasters</p>
<p>Grow in the veins 291 of actions highest reared 292 ,</p>
<p>As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap 293 ,</p>
<p>Infect the sound pine 294 and diverts his grain 295</p>
<p>Tortive and errant 296 from his course of growth.</p>
<p>Nor, princes, is it matter new to us</p>
<p>That we come short of our suppose 297 so far</p>
<p>That after seven years’ siege yet Troy walls stand,</p>
<p>Sith every action that hath gone before,</p>
<p>Whereof we have record, trial did draw</p>
<p>Bias and thwart 298 , not answering the aim</p>
<p>And that unbodied figure of the thought</p>
<p>That gave’t surmisèd shape 299 . Why then, you princes,</p>
<p>Do you with cheeks abashed behold our works 300</p>
<p>And think them shame, which are indeed nought else</p>
<p>But the protractive 301 trials of great Jove 302</p>
<p>To find persistive 303 constancy in men,</p>
<p>The fineness of which metal 304 is not found</p>
<p>In fortune’s love 305 ? For then the bold and coward,</p>
<p>The wise and fool, the artist 306 and unread,</p>
<p>The hard and soft seem all affined 307 and kin.</p>
<p>But in the wind and tempest of her 308 frown,</p>
<p>Distinction 309 with a loud and powerful fan,</p>
<p>Puffing at all, winnows 310 the light away;</p>
<p>And what hath mass or matter 311 by itself</p>
<p>Lies rich in virtue 312 and unminglèd.</p>
<p>NESTOR With due observance of 313 thy godly seat 314 ,</p>
<p>Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply 315</p>
<p>Thy latest words. In the reproof 316 of chance</p>
<p>Lies the true proof 317 of men: the sea being smooth,</p>
<p>How many shallow bauble 318 boats dare sail</p>
<p>Upon her patient breast, making their way</p>
<p>With those of nobler bulk!</p>
<p>But let the ruffian Boreas 319 once enrage</p>
<p>The gentle Thetis 320 , and anon behold</p>
<p>The strong-ribbed bark 321 through liquid mountains 322 cut,</p>
<p>Bounding between the two moist elements 323 ,</p>
<p>Like Perseus’ horse 324 : where’s then the saucy 325 boat</p>
<p>Whose weak untimbered 326 sides but even now</p>
<p>Co-rivalled greatness 327 ? Either to harbour fled,</p>
<p>Or made a toast 328 for Neptune 329 . Even so 330</p>
<p>Doth valour’s show 331 and valour’s worth divide</p>
<p>In storms of fortune; for in her 332 ray and brightness</p>
<p>The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze 333</p>
<p>Than by the tiger, but when the splitting wind</p>
<p>Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,</p>
<p>And flies fled under shade 334 , why, then the thing of courage,</p>
<p>As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize 335 ,</p>
<p>And with an accent tuned in selfsame key</p>
<p>Retires 336 to chiding fortune.</p>
<p>ULYSSES Agamemnon,</p>
<p>Thou great commander, nerve 337 and bone of Greece,</p>
<p>Heart of our numbers 338 , soul and only 339 spirit 340 ,</p>
<p>In whom the tempers 341 and the minds of all</p>
<p>Should be shut up 342 , hear what Ulysses speaks:</p>
<p>Besides the applause and approbation</p>
<p>The which 343 — most mighty for thy place and sway 344 ,—</p>
<p>To Agamemnon</p>
<p>And thou most reverend 345 for thy stretched-out 346 life,—</p>
<p>To Nestor</p>
<p>I give to both your speeches, which were such</p>
<p>As Agamemnon and 347 the hand of Greece</p>
<p>Should hold up high in brass 348 , and such again</p>
<p>As venerable Nestor, hatched 349 in silver 350 ,</p>
<p>Should with a bond of air 351 , strong as the axle-tree</p>
<p>In which the heavens ride 352 , knit 353 all the Greeks’ ears</p>
<p>To his experienced tongue: yet let it please both,</p>
<p>Thou great, and wise 354 , to hear Ulysses speak.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Speak, prince of Ithaca 355 , and be’t of less expect
356</p>
<p>That matter needless, of importless burden 357 ,</p>
<p>Divide thy lips than we are confident,</p>
<p>When rank 358 Thersites opes 359 his mastic 360 jaws,</p>
<p>We shall hear music, wit and oracle.</p>
<p>ULYSSES Troy, yet upon his basis 361 , had 362 been down,</p>
<p>And the great Hector’s sword had lacked a master,</p>
<p>But for these instances 363 .</p>
<p>The specialty of rule 364 hath been neglected;</p>
<p>And look how 365 many Grecian tents do stand</p>
<p>Hollow 366 upon this plain, so many hollow factions 367 .</p>
<p>When that the general 368 is not like the hive 369</p>
<p>To whom the foragers shall all repair 370 ,</p>
<p>What honey is expected? Degree 371 being vizarded 372 ,</p>
<p>Th’unworthiest shows as fairly 373 in the mask.</p>
<p>The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre 374</p>
<p>Observe degree, priority and place,</p>
<p>Insisture 375 , course, proportion, season, form,</p>
<p>Office 376 and custom, in all line of order:</p>
<p>And therefore is the glorious planet Sol 377</p>
<p>In noble eminence enthroned and sphered 378</p>
<p>Amidst the other 379 , whose med’cinable eye</p>
<p>Corrects the ill 380 aspects of planets evil,</p>
<p>And posts 381 , like the commandment of a king,</p>
<p>Sans check 382 , to good and bad. But when the planets</p>
<p>In evil mixture 383 to disorder wander 384 ,</p>
<p>What plagues and what portents, what mutiny,</p>
<p>What raging of the sea, shaking of earth,</p>
<p>Commotion in the winds, frights, changes, horrors,</p>
<p>Divert and crack, rend and deracinate 385</p>
<p>The unity and married 386 calm of states</p>
<p>Quite 387 from their fixure 388 ? O, when degree 389 is shaked,</p>
<p>Which is the ladder to all high designs 390 ,</p>
<p>The enterprise is sick! How could communities,</p>
<p>Degrees in schools 391 and brotherhoods 392 in cities,</p>
<p>Peaceful commerce from dividable shores 393 ,</p>
<p>The primogenitive 394 and due of birth,</p>
<p>Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,</p>
<p>But 395 by degree, stand in authentic place 396 ?</p>
<p>Take but degree away, untune that string,</p>
<p>And, hark, what discord follows. Each thing meets</p>
<p>In mere oppugnancy 397 . The bounded 398 waters</p>
<p>Should 399 lift their bosoms higher than the shores</p>
<p>And make a sop of all this solid globe 400 :</p>
<p>Strength should be lord of imbecility 401 ,</p>
<p>And the rude 402 son should strike his father dead:</p>
<p>Force should be right, or rather, right and wrong,</p>
<p>Between whose endless jar 403 justice resides,</p>
<p>Should lose their names 404 , and so should justice too.</p>
<p>Then everything includes 405 itself in power,</p>
<p>Power into will 406 , will into appetite 407 ,</p>
<p>And appetite, an universal wolf,</p>
<p>So doubly seconded 408 with will and power,</p>
<p>Must make perforce an universal prey 409 ,</p>
<p>And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,</p>
<p>This chaos, when degree is suffocate 410 ,</p>
<p>Follows the choking 411 .</p>
<p>And this neglection of degree is it</p>
<p>That by a pace 412 goes backward, in a purpose</p>
<p>It hath to climb 413 . The general’s disdained</p>
<p>By him one step below, he by the next,</p>
<p>That next by him beneath, so every step</p>
<p>Exampled 414 by the first pace that is sick</p>
<p>Of his superior 415 , grows to an envious fever</p>
<p>Of pale and bloodless emulation 416 :</p>
<p>And ’tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot 417 ,</p>
<p>Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,</p>
<p>Troy in our weakness lives, not in her strength.</p>
<p>NESTOR Most wisely hath Ulysses here discovered 418</p>
<p>The fever whereof all our power 419 is sick.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses, What is the
remedy?</p>
<p>ULYSSES The great Achilles, whom opinion 420 crowns</p>
<p>The sinew and the forehand 421 of our host 422 ,</p>
<p>Having his ear full of his airy 423 fame,</p>
<p>Grows dainty of 424 his worth, and in his tent</p>
<p>Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus</p>
<p>Upon a lazy bed 425 the livelong day</p>
<p>Breaks 426 scurril jests,</p>
<p>And with ridiculous 427 and awkward 428 action —</p>
<p>Which, slanderer, he imitation calls —</p>
<p>He pageants 429 us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,</p>
<p>Thy topless deputation 430 he puts on 431 ,</p>
<p>And, like a strutting player, whose conceit 432</p>
<p>Lies in his hamstring 433 , and doth think it rich</p>
<p>To hear the wooden 434 dialogue and sound</p>
<p>’Twixt his stretched footing and the scaffoldage 435 ,</p>
<p>Such to-be-pitied and o’er-wrested seeming 436</p>
<p>He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,</p>
<p>’Tis like a chime a-mending 437 , with terms unsquared 438 ,</p>
<p>Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon 439 dropped</p>
<p>Would seems hyperboles. At this fusty 440 stuff</p>
<p>The large 441 Achilles, on his pressed 442 bed lolling,</p>
<p>From his deep 443 chest laughs out a loud applause,</p>
<p>Cries ’Excellent! ’Tis Agamemnon just 444 .</p>
<p>Now play me 445 Nestor: hum 446 and stroke thy beard,</p>
<p>As he being dressed to 447 some oration.’</p>
<p>That’s done, as near as the extremest ends</p>
<p>Of parallels 448 , as like as Vulcan and his wife 449 ,</p>
<p>Yet god 450 Achilles still cries, ’Excellent!</p>
<p>’Tis Nestor right. Now play him me 451 , Patroclus,</p>
<p>Arming to answer in 452 a night alarm.’</p>
<p>And then, forsooth 453 , the faint defects of age</p>
<p>Must be the scene of mirth: to cough and spit,</p>
<p>And, with a palsy-fumbling 454 on his gorget,</p>
<p>Shake in and out the rivet 455 : and at thissport 456</p>
<p>Sir Valour 457 dies 458 ; cries ’O, enough, Patroclus,</p>
<p>Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all</p>
<p>In pleasure of my spleen 459 .’ And in this fashion,</p>
<p>All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,</p>
<p>Severals and generals of grace exact 460 ,</p>
<p>Achievements, plots, orders, preventions 461 ,</p>
<p>Excitements 462 to the field, or speech for truce,</p>
<p>Success or loss, what is or is not, serves</p>
<p>As stuff for these two to make paradoxes 463 .</p>
<p>NESTOR And in the imitation of these twain 464 —</p>
<p>Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns</p>
<p>With an imperial voice 465 — many are infect 466 .</p>
<p>Ajax is grown self-willed, and bears his head</p>
<p>In such a rein 467 , in full as proud a place 468</p>
<p>As broad 469 Achilles, and keeps his tent like him;</p>
<p>Makes factious 470 feasts, rails on 471 our state of war,</p>
<p>Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,</p>
<p>A slave 472 whose gall 473 coins slanders like a mint 474 ,</p>
<p>To match us in comparisons with dirt,</p>
<p>To weaken and discredit our exposure 475 ,</p>
<p>How rank soever rounded in with danger 476 .</p>
<p>ULYSSES They tax our policy 477 , and call it cowardice,</p>
<p>Count wisdom as no member of the war,</p>
<p>Forestall prescience 478 , and esteem no act</p>
<p>But that of hand 479 : the still and mental parts,</p>
<p>That do contrive 480 how many hands shall strike</p>
<p>When fitness 481 calls them on, and know by measure</p>
<p>Of their observant toil the enemies’ weight 482 —</p>
<p>Why, this hath not a finger’s dignity 483 .</p>
<p>They call this bed-work 484 , mapp’ry 485 , closet-war 486 ,</p>
<p>So that the ram 487 that batters down the wall,</p>
<p>For 488 the great swing and rudeness of his poise 489 ,</p>
<p>They place before his hand that made the engine 490 ,</p>
<p>Or those that with the fineness of their souls 491</p>
<p>By reason guide his execution 492 .</p>
<p>NESTOR Let this be granted, and Achilles’ horse</p>
<p>Makes many Thetis’ sons 493 .</p>
<p>Tucket 494</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON What trumpet? Look, Menelaus.</p>
<p>MENELAUS From Troy.</p>
<p>Enter Aeneas</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON What would you ’fore 495 our tent?</p>
<p>AENEAS Is this great Agamemnon’s tent, I pray you?</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Even this.</p>
<p>AENEAS May one that is a herald and a prince</p>
<p>Do a fair 496 message to his kingly ears?</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON With surety 497 stronger than Achilles’ arm</p>
<p>’Fore all the Greekish heads 498 , which with one voice</p>
<p>Call Agamemnon head and general.</p>
<p>AENEAS Fair leave 499 and large 500 security. How may</p>
<p>A stranger to those most imperial looks</p>
<p>Know them from eyes of other mortals?</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON How?</p>
<p>AENEAS Ay,</p>
<p>I ask that I might waken reverence 501 ,</p>
<p>And on the cheek be ready with a blush</p>
<p>Modest as morning when she coldly 502 eyes</p>
<p>The youthful Phoebus 503 .</p>
<p>Which is that god in office, guiding men?</p>
<p>Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON This Trojan scorns us, or the men of Troy Are ceremonious
courtiers.</p>
<p>AENEAS Courtiers as free 504 , as debonair, unarmed,</p>
<p>As bending 505 angels: that’s their fame 506 in peace.</p>
<p>But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls 507 ,</p>
<p>Good arms, strong joints, true swords, and,</p>
<p>Jove’s accord 508 ,</p>
<p>Nothing so full of heart 509 . But peace, Aeneas,</p>
<p>Peace, Trojan, lay thy finger on thy lips.</p>
<p>The worthiness of praise distains his worth 510 ,</p>
<p>If that the praised himself bring the praise forth 511 .</p>
<p>But what the repining 512 enemy commends 513 ,</p>
<p>That breath fame blows 514 , that praise, sole 515 pure,
transcends.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?</p>
<p>AENEAS Ay, Greek, that is my name.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON What’s your affair I pray you?</p>
<p>AENEAS Sir, pardon, ’tis for Agamemnon’s ears.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON He hears nought privately that comes from Troy.</p>
<p>AENEAS Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:</p>
<p>I bring a trumpet 516 to awake his ear,</p>
<p>To set his sense on the attentive bent 517 ,</p>
<p>And then to speak.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Speak frankly 518 as the wind:</p>
<p>It is not Agamemnon’s sleeping hour,</p>
<p>That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,</p>
<p>He tells thee so himself.</p>
<p>AENEAS Trumpet, blow loud,</p>
<p>Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents,</p>
<p>And every Greek of mettle 519 , let him know</p>
<p>What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.</p>
<p>The trumpets sound</p>
<p>We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy</p>
<p>A prince called Hector — Priam is his father —</p>
<p>Who in this dull 520 and long-continued truce</p>
<p>Is rusty grown. He bade me take a trumpet,</p>
<p>And to this purpose speak: kings, princes, lords,</p>
<p>If there be one amongst the fair’st 521 of Greece</p>
<p>That holds his honour higher than his ease 522 ,</p>
<p>That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,</p>
<p>That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,</p>
<p>That loves 523 his mistress more than in confession,</p>
<p>With truant vows to her own lips he loves,</p>
<p>And dare avow her beauty and her worth</p>
<p>In other arms than hers 524 — to him this challenge.</p>
<p>Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,</p>
<p>Shall make it good, or do his best to do it.</p>
<p>He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,</p>
<p>Than ever Greek did compass 525 in his arms,</p>
<p>And will 526 tomorrow with his trumpet call</p>
<p>Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,</p>
<p>To rouse 527 a Grecian that is true in love:</p>
<p>If any come, Hector shall honour him:</p>
<p>If none, he’ll say in Troy when he retires 528 ,</p>
<p>The Grecian dames are sunburnt 529 and not worth</p>
<p>The splinter of a lance 530 . Even so much 531 .</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas:</p>
<p>If none of them have soul 532 in such a kind,</p>
<p>We left them all at home. But we are soldiers,</p>
<p>And may that soldier a mere recreant 533 prove,</p>
<p>That means not 534 , hath not, or is not in love!</p>
<p>If then one is, or hath, or means to be,</p>
<p>That one meets Hector: if none else, I’ll be he.</p>
<p>NESTOR Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man</p>
<p>When Hector’s grandsire 535 sucked 536 . He is old now,</p>
<p>But if there be not in our Grecian mould</p>
<p>One noble man that hath one spark of fire,</p>
<p>To answer for his love, tell him from me</p>
<p>I’ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver 537</p>
<p>And in my vantbrace 538 put this withered brawn 539 ,</p>
<p>And meeting him will tell him that my lady</p>
<p>Was fairer than his grandam 540 and as chaste</p>
<p>As may be in the world. His youth in flood 541 ,</p>
<p>I’ll pawn 542 this truth with my three drops of blood 543 .</p>
<p>AENEAS Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!</p>
<p>ULYSSES Amen.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON Fair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand:</p>
<p>To our pavilion 544 shall I lead you first.</p>
<p>Achilles shall have word of this intent,</p>
<p>So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent.</p>
<p>Yourself shall feast with us before you go</p>
<p>And find the welcome of a noble foe.</p>
<p>Exeunt. Ulysses and Nestor remain</p>
<p>ULYSSES Nestor.</p>
<p>NESTOR What says Ulysses?</p>
<p>ULYSSES I have a young conception 545 in my brain,</p>
<p>Be you my time to bring it to some shape 546 .</p>
<p>NESTOR What is’t?</p>
<p>ULYSSES This ’tis:</p>
<p>Blunt wedges rive hard knots 547 : the seeded 548 pride</p>
<p>That hath to this maturity blown up 549</p>
<p>In rank 550 Achilles must or 551 now be cropped</p>
<p>Or, shedding 552 , breed a nursery 553 of like 554 evil,</p>
<p>To overbulk 555 us all.</p>
<p>NESTOR Well, and how?</p>
<p>ULYSSES This challenge that the gallant 556 Hector sends,</p>
<p>However it is spread in general name 557 ,</p>
<p>Relates in purpose only to Achilles.</p>
<p>NESTOR The purpose is perspicuous even as substance</p>
<p>Whose grossness little characters sum up 558 :</p>
<p>And, in the publication, make no strain 559</p>
<p>But that Achilles, were his brain as barren</p>
<p>As banks of Libya 560 — though, Apollo knows,</p>
<p>’Tis dry 561 enough — will, with great speed of judgement,</p>
<p>Ay, with celerity 562 , find Hector’s purpose</p>
<p>Pointing on 563 him.</p>
<p>ULYSSES And wake him to the answer 564 , think you?</p>
<p>NESTOR Yes, ’tis most meet 565 ; who may you else oppose 566</p>
<p>That can from Hector bring his honour off 567 ,</p>
<p>If not Achilles? Though’t be a sportful 568 combat,</p>
<p>Yet in this trial 569 much opinion 570 dwells,</p>
<p>For here the Trojans taste our dear’st repute 571</p>
<p>With their fin’st 572 palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,</p>
<p>Our imputation 573 shall be oddly poised 574</p>
<p>In this wild 575 action. For the success 576 ,</p>
<p>Although particular 577 , shall give a scantling 578</p>
<p>Of good or bad unto the general 579 ,</p>
<p>And in such indexes 580 , although small pricks 581</p>
<p>To 582 their subsequent volumes 583 , there is seen</p>
<p>The baby figure 584 of the giant mass</p>
<p>Of things to come at large 585 . It is supposed</p>
<p>He that meets Hector issues 586 from our choice;</p>
<p>And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,</p>
<p>Makes merit her election 587 , and doth boil 588 ,</p>
<p>As ’twere from forth us all, a man distilled 589</p>
<p>Out of our virtues; who miscarrying 590 ,</p>
<p>What heart 591 from hence 592 receives the conqu’ring part 593</p>
<p>To steel a strong opinion to themselves 594 ,</p>
<p>Which entertained, limbs 595 are his instruments,</p>
<p>In no less working than are swords and bows</p>
<p>Directive by the limbs.</p>
<p>ULYSSES Give pardon to my speech:</p>
<p>Therefore ’tis meet 596 Achilles meet 597 not Hector.</p>
<p>Let us, like merchants, show our foulest 598 wares,</p>
<p>And think perchance 599 they’ll sell: if not,</p>
<p>The lustre of the better yet to show,</p>
<p>Shall show the better. Do not consent</p>
<p>That ever Hector and Achilles meet,</p>
<p>For both our honour and our shame in this</p>
<p>Are dogged with two strange followers 600 .</p>
<p>NESTOR I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?</p>
<p>ULYSSES What glory our Achilles shares 601 from Hector,</p>
<p>Were he not proud, we all should wear with him:</p>
<p>But he already is too insolent 602 ,</p>
<p>And we were better parch in Afric sun 603</p>
<p>Than in the pride and salt 604 scorn of his eyes,</p>
<p>Should he scape 605 Hector fair 606 . If he were foiled,</p>
<p>Why then, we did our main opinion crush 607</p>
<p>In taint 608 of our best man. No, make a lott’ry,</p>
<p>And by device 609 let blockish 610 Ajax draw</p>
<p>The sort 611 to fight with Hector: among ourselves</p>
<p>Give him allowance 612 as the worthier man,</p>
<p>For that will physic 613 the great Myrmidon 614</p>
<p>Who broils 615 in loud applause, and make him fall 616</p>
<p>His crest 617 that prouder than blue Iris 618 bends 619 .</p>
<p>If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off 620 ,</p>
<p>We’ll dress him up in voices 621 : if he fail,</p>
<p>Yet go we under our opinion 622 still</p>
<p>That we have better men. But, hit or miss,</p>
<p>Our project’s life this shape of sense assumes 623 :</p>
<p>Ajax employed 624 plucks down Achilles’ plumes.</p>
<p>NESTOR Now, Ulysses,</p>
<p>I begin to relish 625 thy advice;</p>
<p>And I will give a taste of it forthwith</p>
<p>To Agamemnon. Go we to him straight 626 .</p>
<p>Two curs 627 shall tame each other: pride alone</p>
<p>Must tarre 628 the mastiffs on, as ’twere their bone.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
