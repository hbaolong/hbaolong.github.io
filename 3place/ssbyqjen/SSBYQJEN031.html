552</h4>
<p>Enter Duke, Turio [and ] Proteus</p>
<p>DUKE Sir Turio, give us leave 553 , I pray, awhile:</p>
<p>We have some secrets to confer about.</p>
<p>[Exit Turio ]</p>
<p>Now, tell me, Proteus, what’s your will with me?</p>
<p>PROTEUS My gracious lord, that which I would discover</p>
<p>The law of friendship bids me to conceal,</p>
<p>But when I call to mind your gracious favours</p>
<p>Done to me — undeserving as I am —</p>
<p>My duty pricks 554 me on to utter that</p>
<p>Which else no worldly good should draw from me.</p>
<p>Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine my friend</p>
<p>This night intends to steal away your daughter:</p>
<p>Myself am one made privy to 555 the plot.</p>
<p>I know you have determined to bestow her</p>
<p>On Turio, whom your gentle daughter hates,</p>
<p>And should she thus be stol’n away from you,</p>
<p>It would be much vexation 556 to your age.</p>
<p>Thus, for my duty’s sake, I rather chose</p>
<p>To cross my friend in his intended drift,</p>
<p>Than, by concealing it, heap on your head</p>
<p>A pack of sorrows which would press you down,</p>
<p>Being unprevented, to your timeless 557 grave.</p>
<p>DUKE Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,</p>
<p>Which to requite 558 , command me 559 while I live.</p>
<p>This love of theirs myself have often seen,</p>
<p>Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,</p>
<p>And oftentimes have purposed 560 to forbid</p>
<p>Sir Valentine her company and my court.</p>
<p>But fearing lest my jealous aim 561 might err</p>
<p>And so unworthily disgrace the man —</p>
<p>A rashness that I ever yet have shunned —</p>
<p>I gave him gentle 562 looks, thereby to find</p>
<p>That which thyself hast now disclosed to me 563 .</p>
<p>And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,</p>
<p>Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested 564 ,</p>
<p>I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,</p>
<p>The key whereof myself have ever kept:</p>
<p>And thence she cannot be conveyed away.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean</p>
<p>How he her chamber-window will ascend,</p>
<p>And with a corded ladder fetch her down:</p>
<p>For which, the youthful lover now is gone,</p>
<p>And this way comes he with it presently,</p>
<p>Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.</p>
<p>But, good my lord, do it so cunningly</p>
<p>That my discovery be not aimed at 565 :</p>
<p>For love of you, not hate unto my friend,</p>
<p>Hath made me publisher 566 of this pretence 567 .</p>
<p>DUKE Upon mine honour, he shall never know</p>
<p>That I had any light 568 from thee of this.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Adieu, my lord: Sir Valentine is coming.</p>
<p>[Exit Proteus ]</p>
<p>[Enter Valentine ]</p>
<p>DUKE Sir Valentine, whither away 569 so fast?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Please it your grace, there is a messenger</p>
<p>That stays to bear my letters to my friends,</p>
<p>And I am going to deliver them.</p>
<p>DUKE Be they of much import?</p>
<p>VALENTINE The tenor 570 of them doth but signify</p>
<p>My health and happy being at your court.</p>
<p>DUKE Nay then, no matter. Stay with me awhile:</p>
<p>I am to break 571 with thee of some affairs</p>
<p>That touch me near 572 , wherein thou must be secret.</p>
<p>’Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought</p>
<p>To match my friend Sir Turio to my daughter.</p>
<p>VALENTINE I know it well, my lord, and sure the match</p>
<p>Were rich and honourable: besides, the gentleman</p>
<p>Is full of virtue, bounty 573 , worth and qualities</p>
<p>Beseeming 574 such a wife as your fair daughter.</p>
<p>Cannot your grace win her to fancy him?</p>
<p>DUKE No, trust me, she is peevish 575 , sullen, froward 576 ,</p>
<p>Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,</p>
<p>Neither regarding 577 that she is my child</p>
<p>Nor fearing me as if I were 578 her father.</p>
<p>And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,</p>
<p>Upon advice 579 , hath drawn my love from her,</p>
<p>And, where I thought the remnant of mine age 580</p>
<p>Should have been cherished by her child-like duty,</p>
<p>I now am full resolved to take a wife</p>
<p>And turn her out to who 581 will take her in:</p>
<p>Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower 582 ,</p>
<p>For me and my possessions she esteems 583 not.</p>
<p>VALENTINE What would your grace have me to do in this?</p>
<p>DUKE There is a lady in Verona here</p>
<p>Whom I affect 584 : but she is nice 585 and coy,</p>
<p>And nought esteems my agèd eloquence 586 .</p>
<p>Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor —</p>
<p>For long agone 587 I have forgot to court 588 ,</p>
<p>Besides, the fashion of the time is changed —</p>
<p>How and which way I may bestow 589 myself</p>
<p>To be regarded 590 in her sun-bright eye.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:</p>
<p>Dumb jewels often in their silent kind 591</p>
<p>More than quick 592 words do move a woman’s mind.</p>
<p>DUKE But she did scorn a present that I sent her.</p>
<p>VALENTINE A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.</p>
<p>Send her another: never give her o’er 593 ,</p>
<p>For scorn at first makes after-love the more 594 .</p>
<p>If she do frown, ’tis not in hate of you,</p>
<p>But rather to beget 595 more love in you.</p>
<p>If she do chide, ’tis not to have you gone,</p>
<p>Forwhy 596 , the fools are mad, if left alone.</p>
<p>Take no repulse, whatever she doth say,</p>
<p>For 597 ‘get you gone’, she doth not mean ‘away!’</p>
<p>Flatter and praise, commend 598 , extol their graces 599 :</p>
<p>Though ne’er so black 600 , say they have angels’ faces.</p>
<p>That man that hath a tongue, I say is no man</p>
<p>If with his tongue 601 he cannot win a woman.</p>
<p>DUKE But she I mean is promised by her friends 602</p>
<p>Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,</p>
<p>And kept severely from resort of men,</p>
<p>That 603 no man hath access by day to her.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Why then I would resort to her by night.</p>
<p>DUKE Ay, but the doors be locked and keys kept safe,</p>
<p>That no man hath recourse to her by night.</p>
<p>VALENTINE What lets 604 but one may enter at her window?</p>
<p>DUKE Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,</p>
<p>And built so shelving 605 that one cannot climb it</p>
<p>Without apparent hazard of his life.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Why then, a ladder quaintly 606 made of cords</p>
<p>To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks 607 ,</p>
<p>Would serve to scale another Hero’s tower 608 ,</p>
<p>So 609 bold Leander would adventure it.</p>
<p>DUKE Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood 610 ,</p>
<p>Advise me where I may have such a ladder.</p>
<p>VALENTINE When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.</p>
<p>DUKE This very night; for Love is like a child</p>
<p>That longs for everything that he can come by.</p>
<p>VALENTINE By seven o’clock I’ll get you such a ladder.</p>
<p>DUKE But, hark thee: I will go to her alone.</p>
<p>How shall I best convey the ladder thither?</p>
<p>VALENTINE It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it</p>
<p>Under a cloak that is of any length 611 .</p>
<p>DUKE A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn 612 ?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p>DUKE Then let me see thy cloak:</p>
<p>I’ll get me one of such another 613 length.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.</p>
<p>DUKE How shall I fashion me 614 to wear a cloak?</p>
<p>I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.</p>
<p>Takes Valentine’s cloak and discovers a letter</p>
<p>and a rope ladder concealed under it</p>
<p>What letter is this same 615 ? What’s here? ‘To Silvia’!</p>
<p>And here an engine fit for my proceeding 616 .</p>
<p>I’ll be so bold to break the seal for once.</p>
<p>’My thoughts do harbour 617 with my Silvia nightly,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>And slaves they are to me that send them flying.</p>
<p>O, could their master come and go as lightly 618 ,</p>
<p>Himself 619 would lodge where, senseless 620 , they are lying 621
.</p>
<p>My herald 622 thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them 623 ,</p>
<p>While I, their king, that thither them importune 624 ,</p>
<p>Do curse the grace 625 that with such grace hath blessed them,</p>
<p>Because myself do want 626 my servants’ 627 fortune.</p>
<p>I curse myself, for they are sent by me,</p>
<p>That they should harbour where their lord should be.’</p>
<p>What’s here?</p>
<p>‘Silvia, this night I will enfranchise 628 thee.’</p>
<p>’Tis so: and here’s the ladder for the purpose.</p>
<p>Why, Phaeton — for thou art Merops’ son 629 —</p>
<p>Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car,</p>
<p>And with thy daring folly burn the world?</p>
<p>Wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee?</p>
<p>Go, base intruder, overweening slave 630 ,</p>
<p>Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates 631 ,</p>
<p>And think my patience, more than thy desert,</p>
<p>Is privilege for thy departure hence 632 .</p>
<p>Thank me for this more than for all the favours</p>
<p>Which, all too much, I have bestowed on thee.</p>
<p>But if thou linger in my territories</p>
<p>Longer than swiftest expedition 633</p>
<p>Will give thee time to leave our royal court,</p>
<p>By heaven, my wrath shall far exceed the love</p>
<p>I ever bore my daughter or thyself.</p>
<p>Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse,</p>
<p>But as thou lov’st thy life, make speed from hence.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>VALENTINE And why not death, rather than living torment?</p>
<p>To die is to be banished from myself,</p>
<p>And Silvia is myself: banished from her</p>
<p>Is self from self. A deadly banishment:</p>
<p>What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?</p>
<p>What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by 634 ?</p>
<p>Unless it be to think that she is by</p>
<p>And feed upon the shadow 635 of perfection.</p>
<p>Except 636 I be by Silvia in the night,</p>
<p>There is no music in the nightingale.</p>
<p>Unless I look on Silvia in the day,</p>
<p>There is no day for me to look upon.</p>
<p>She is my essence, and I leave to be 637</p>
<p>If I be not by her fair influence 638</p>
<p>Fostered 639 , illumined 640 , cherished, kept alive.</p>
<p>I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom 641 :</p>
<p>Tarry I here, I but attend on 642 death,</p>
<p>But fly I hence, I fly away from life.</p>
<p>[Enter Proteus and Lance ]</p>
<p>PROTEUS Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.</p>
<p>LANCE So-ho 643 , so-ho!</p>
<p>PROTEUS What see’st thou?</p>
<p>LANCE Him we go to find: there’s not a hair 644 on’s head but ’tis a
Valentine 645 .</p>
<p>PROTEUS Valentine?</p>
<p>VALENTINE No.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Who then? His spirit 646 ?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Neither.</p>
<p>PROTEUS What then?</p>
<p>VALENTINE Nothing.</p>
<p>LANCE Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?</p>
<p>PROTEUS Who wouldst thou strike?</p>
<p>LANCE Nothing.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Villain 647 , forbear.</p>
<p>LANCE Why, sir, I’ll strike nothing 648 . I pray you—</p>
<p>PROTEUS Sirrah, I say forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.</p>
<p>VALENTINE My ears are stopped 649 and cannot hear good news,</p>
<p>So much of bad already hath possessed them.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Then in dumb silence will I bury mine 650 ,</p>
<p>For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.</p>
<p>VALENTINE Is Silvia dead?</p>
<p>PROTEUS No, Valentine.</p>
<p>VALENTINE No Valentine 651 indeed, for sacred Silvia.</p>
<p>Hath she forsworn 652 me?</p>
<p>PROTEUS No, Valentine.</p>
<p>VALENTINE No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.</p>
<p>What is your news?</p>
<p>LANCE Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished 653 .</p>
<p>PROTEUS That thou art banished — O, that’s the news —</p>
<p>From hence, from Silvia, and from me thy friend.</p>
<p>VALENTINE O, I have fed upon this woe already,</p>
<p>And now excess of it will make me surfeit 654 .</p>
<p>Doth Silvia know that I am banishèd?</p>
<p>PROTEUS Ay, ay: and she hath offered to the doom —</p>
<p>Which unreversed stands in effectual force 655 —</p>
<p>A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:</p>
<p>Those at her father’s churlish feet she tendered 656 ,</p>
<p>With them, upon her knees, her humble self,</p>
<p>Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became 657 them</p>
<p>As if but now they waxèd 658 pale for woe.</p>
<p>But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,</p>
<p>Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears</p>
<p>Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire 659 ;</p>
<p>But Valentine, if he be ta’en, must die.</p>
<p>Besides, her intercession 660 chafed 661 him so,</p>
<p>When she for thy repeal 662 was suppliant 663 ,</p>
<p>That to close 664 prison he commanded her,</p>
<p>With many bitter threats of biding 665 there.</p>
<p>VALENTINE No more, unless the next word that thou speak’st</p>
<p>Have some malignant 666 power upon my life:</p>
<p>If so, I pray thee breathe it in mine ear,</p>
<p>As ending anthem of my endless dolour 667 .</p>
<p>PROTEUS Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,</p>
<p>And study 668 help for that which thou lament’st:</p>
<p>Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.</p>
<p>Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love:</p>
<p>Besides, thy staying will abridge 669 thy life.</p>
<p>Hope is a lover’s staff: walk hence with that</p>
<p>And manage 670 it against despairing thoughts.</p>
<p>Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence,</p>
<p>Which, being writ to me, shall be delivered</p>
<p>Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love 671 .</p>
<p>The time now serves not to expostulate 672 :</p>
<p>Come, I’ll convey thee through the city-gate,</p>
<p>And ere I part with thee, confer at large 673</p>
<p>Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.</p>
<p>As thou lov’st Silvia, though not for thyself 674 ,</p>
<p>Regard 675 thy danger, and along with me.</p>
<p>VALENTINE I pray thee, Lance, an if thou see’st my boy 676 ,</p>
<p>Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.</p>
<p>PROTEUS Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.</p>
<p>VALENTINE O, my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!</p>
<p>[Exeunt Valentine and Proteus ]</p>
<p>LANCE I am but a fool, look you, and yet I have the wit to think my
master is a kind of a knave: but that’s all one, if he be but one knave
677 . He lives not now that 678 knows me to be in love, yet I am in
love, but a team of horse 679 shall not pluck that from me, nor who ‘tis
I love: and yet ’tis a woman, but what woman, I will not tell myself:
and yet ’tis a milkmaid, yet ’tis not a maid 680 , for she hath had
gossips 681 : yet ’tis a maid 682 , for she is her master’s maid, and
serves 683 for wages. She hath more qualities 684 than a water-spaniel
685 , which is much in a bare 686 Christian. Here is the cate-log of her
condition 687 . ’Inprimis 688 : She can fetch 689 and carry.’ Why, a
horse can do no more; nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only carry,
therefore is she better than a jade 690 . ‘Item 691 : She can milk 692
.’ Look you, a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands.</p>

<p>SPEED How now, Signior Lance? What news with your mastership?</p>
<p>LANCE With my master’s ship? Why, it is at sea.</p>
<p>SPEED Well, your old vice 693 still: mistake the word. What news,
then, in your paper?</p>
<p>LANCE The blackest news that ever thou heard’st.</p>
<p>SPEED Why, man? How black?</p>
<p>LANCE Why, as black as ink.</p>
<p>SPEED Let me read them.</p>
<p>LANCE Fie on thee, jolt-head 694 , thou canst not read.</p>
<p>SPEED Thou liest: I can.</p>
<p>LANCE I will try 695 thee. Tell me this: who begot 696 thee?</p>
<p>SPEED Marry, the son of my grandfather.</p>
<p>LANCE O illiterate loiterer! It was the son of thy grandmother: this
proves that thou canst not read.</p>
<p>SPEED Come, fool, come: try me in 697 thy paper.</p>
<p>LANCE There: and Saint Nicholas 698 be thy speed 699 .</p>
<p>Gives him the paper</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Inprimis : She can milk.’</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>LANCE Ay, that she can.</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She brews good ale.’</p>
<p>LANCE And thereof comes the proverb ‘Blessing of your heart, you brew
good ale.’</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She can sew 700 .’</p>
<p>LANCE That’s as much as to say ‘Can she so?’</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She can knit.’</p>
<p>LANCE What need a man care for a stock 701 with a wench, when she can
knit him a stock 702 ?</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She can wash and scour.’</p>
<p>LANCE A special virtue, for then she need not be washed and scoured
703 .</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She can spin 704 .’</p>
<p>LANCE Then may I set the world on wheels 705 , when she can spin for
her living.</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She hath many nameless virtues 706 .’</p>
<p>LANCE That’s as much as to say ‘bastard virtues 707’ that indeed know
not their fathers, and therefore have no names.</p>
<p>SPEED Here follow her vices.</p>
<p>LANCE Close at the heels of her virtues.</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She is not to be kissed fasting in respect of 708 her
breath.’</p>
<p>LANCE Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on.</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She hath a sweet mouth 709 .’</p>
<p>LANCE That makes amends for her sour breath.</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She doth talk in her sleep 710 .’</p>
<p>LANCE It’s no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She is slow in words.’</p>
<p>LANCE O villain, that set this down among her vices! To be slow in
words is a woman’s only virtue: I pray thee out with’t, and place it for
her chief virtue.</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She is proud 711 .’</p>
<p>LANCE Out with that too: it was Eve’s legacy 712 , and cannot be
ta’en from her.</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She hath no teeth 713 .’</p>
<p>LANCE I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She is curst 714 .’</p>
<p>LANCE Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She will often praise 715 her liquor.’</p>
<p>LANCE If her liquor be good, she shall: if she will not, I will, for
good things should be praised.</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She is too liberal 716 .’</p>
<p>LANCE Of her tongue she cannot 717 , for that’s writ down she is slow
of: of her purse she shall not, for that I’ll keep shut. Now, of another
thing 718 she may, and that cannot I help. Well, proceed.</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She hath more hair than wit, and more faults than
hairs, and more wealth than faults.’</p>
<p>LANCE Stop there: I’ll have her. She was mine and not mine, twice or
thrice in that last article. Rehearse 719 that once more.</p>
<p>SPEED ‘Item : She hath more hair than wit’—</p>
<p>LANCE More hair than wit? It may be I’ll prove 720 it. The cover of
the salt hides the salt, and therefore it is more than 721 the salt 722
; the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit, for the greater
hides the less. What’s next?</p>
<p>SPEED ‘And more faults than hairs’—</p>
<p>LANCE That’s monstrous 723 : O, that that were out 724 !</p>
<p>SPEED ‘And more wealth than faults.’</p>
<p>LANCE Why, that word makes the faults gracious 725 . Well, I’ll have
her: and if it be a match, as nothing is impossible—</p>
<p>SPEED What then?</p>
<p>LANCE Why, then will I tell thee — that thy master stays for thee at
the North-gate.</p>
<p>SPEED For me?</p>
<p>LANCE For thee? Ay, who art thou? He hath stayed for a better man
than thee.</p>
<p>SPEED And must I go to him?</p>
<p>LANCE Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so long that going
will scarce serve the turn.</p>
<p>SPEED Why didst not tell me sooner? ’Pox of 726 your love
letters!</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>LANCE Now will he be swinged 727 for reading my letter; an unmannerly
728 slave, that will thrust himself into secrets. I’ll after, to rejoice
in the boy’s correction 729 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
