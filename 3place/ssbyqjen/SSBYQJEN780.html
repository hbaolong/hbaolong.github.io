<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-13">Scene 1 / running scene 13</h4>
<p>Enter King [Henry VI ], Gloucester, [Bishop of ] Winchester, York,
Suffolk, Somerset, Warwick, Talbot, and [the ] Governor [of Paris and ]
Exeter</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Lord Bishop, set the crown upon his head.</p>
<p>WINCHESTER God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!</p>
<p>Crowns King Henry</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Now, Governor of Paris, take your oath,</p>
<p>That you elect 895 no other king but him;</p>
<p>Esteem 896 none friends but such as are his friends,</p>
<p>And none your foes but such as shall pretend 897</p>
<p>Malicious practices against his state:</p>
<p>This shall ye do, so help you righteous God.</p>
<p>Enter Falstaff</p>
<p>FALSTAFF My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais</p>
<p>To haste unto your coronation,</p>
<p>A letter was delivered to my hands,</p>
<p>He shows the letter</p>
<p>Writ to your grace from th’Duke of Burgundy.</p>
<p>TALBOT Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!</p>
<p>I vowed, base knight, when I did meet thee next,</p>
<p>To tear the Garter 898 from thy craven’s 899 leg,</p>
<p>Plucks it off</p>
<p>Which I have done, because unworthily</p>
<p>Thou wast installèd in that high degree.</p>
<p>Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest:</p>
<p>This dastard 900 , at the battle of Patay,</p>
<p>When but in all I was six thousand strong</p>
<p>And that the French were almost ten to one,</p>
<p>Before we met or that a stroke was given,</p>
<p>Like to a trusty squire did run away:</p>
<p>In which assault we lost twelve hundred men.</p>
<p>Myself and divers 901 gentlemen beside</p>
<p>Were there surprised and taken prisoners.</p>
<p>Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss:</p>
<p>Or whether that such cowards ought to wear</p>
<p>This ornament of knighthood: yea or no?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER To say the truth, this fact 902 was infamous</p>
<p>And ill beseeming any common 903 man,</p>
<p>Much more a knight, a captain 904 and a leader.</p>
<p>TALBOT When first this order was ordained, my lords,</p>
<p>Knights of the Garter were of noble birth,</p>
<p>Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage 905 ,</p>
<p>Such as were grown to credit 906 by the wars:</p>
<p>Not fearing death, nor shrinking for 907 distress 908 ,</p>
<p>But always resolute in most extremes.</p>
<p>He then that is not furnished in this sort 909</p>
<p>Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,</p>
<p>Profaning this most honourable order,</p>
<p>And should, if I were worthy to be judge,</p>
<p>Be quite degraded 910 , like a hedge-born swain 911</p>
<p>That doth presume to boast of gentle 912 blood.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear’st thy doom 913
:</p>
<p>Be packing 914 , therefore, thou that wast a knight:</p>
<p>Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death.</p>
<p>[Exit Falstaff ]</p>
<p>And now, my Lord Protector, view the letter</p>
<p>Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER What means his grace, that he hath changed his style 915
?</p>
<p>No more but 916 plain and bluntly ‘To the king’?</p>
<p>Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?</p>
<p>Or doth this churlish 917 superscription 918</p>
<p>Pretend 919 some alteration in good will?</p>
<p>What’s here? — ’I have upon especial cause,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>Moved with compassion of my country’s wrack 920 ,</p>
<p>Together with the pitiful complaints</p>
<p>Of such as your oppression feeds upon,</p>
<p>Forsaken your pernicious 921 faction</p>
<p>And joined with Charles, the rightful King of France.’</p>
<p>O monstrous treachery! Can this be so?</p>
<p>That in alliance, amity and oaths,</p>
<p>There should be found such false dissembling guile?</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI What? Doth my uncle Burgundy revolt 922 ?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Is that the worst this letter doth contain?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Why then Lord Talbot there shall talk with him</p>
<p>And give him chastisement 923 for this abuse.</p>
<p>How say you, my lord? Are you not content?</p>
<p>TALBOT Content, my liege? Yes: but that I am prevented 924 ,</p>
<p>I should have begged I might have been employed.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Then gather strength 925 and march unto him straight
926 :</p>
<p>Let him perceive how ill we brook 927 his treason</p>
<p>And what offence it is to flout 928 his friends.</p>
<p>TALBOT I go, my lord, in heart desiring still 929</p>
<p>You may behold confusion 930 of your foes.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>Enter Vernon and Basset</p>
<p>VERNON Grant me the combat 931 , gracious sovereign.</p>
<p>BASSET And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.</p>
<p>RICHARD DUKE OF YORK This is my servant 932 : hear him, noble
prince.</p>
<p>Pointing to Vernon</p>
<p>SOMERSET And this is mine, sweet Henry, favour him.</p>
<p>Pointing to Basset</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Be patient, lords, and give them leave to speak.</p>
<p>Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim 933 ,</p>
<p>And wherefore crave you combat, or with whom?</p>
<p>VERNON With him, my lord, for he hath done me wrong.</p>
<p>BASSET And I with him, for he hath done me wrong.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI What is that wrong whereof you both complain?</p>
<p>First let me know, and then I’ll answer you.</p>
<p>BASSET Crossing the sea from England into France,</p>
<p>This fellow here with envious 934 carping tongue,</p>
<p>Upbraided me about the rose I wear,</p>
<p>Saying the sanguine 935 colour of the leaves 936</p>
<p>Did represent my master’s blushing cheeks,</p>
<p>When stubbornly he did repugn 937 the truth</p>
<p>About a certain question in the law 938</p>
<p>Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him:</p>
<p>With other vile and ignominious terms:</p>
<p>In confutation 939 of which rude 940 reproach</p>
<p>And in defence of my lord’s worthiness,</p>
<p>I crave the benefit 941 of law of arms.</p>
<p>VERNON And that is my petition 942 , noble lord:</p>
<p>For though he seem with forgèd 943 quaint conceit 944</p>
<p>To set a gloss upon 945 his bold intent,</p>
<p>Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him,</p>
<p>And he first took exceptions at 946 this badge,</p>
<p>Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower</p>
<p>Bewrayed 947 the faintness 948 of my master’s heart.</p>
<p>RICHARD DUKE OF YORK Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?</p>
<p>SOMERSET Your private grudge, my lord of York, will out,</p>
<p>Though ne’er so cunningly you smother it.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick 949 men,</p>
<p>When for so slight and frivolous a cause</p>
<p>Such factious emulations 950 shall arise?</p>
<p>Good cousins 951 both of York and Somerset,</p>
<p>Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.</p>
<p>RICHARD DUKE OF YORK Let this dissension first be tried by fight,</p>
<p>And then your highness shall command a peace.</p>
<p>SOMERSET The quarrel toucheth 952 none but us alone:</p>
<p>Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.</p>
<p>RICHARD DUKE OF YORK There is my pledge 953 : accept it,
Somerset.</p>
<p>VERNON Nay, let it rest 954 where it began at first.</p>
<p>BASSET Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Confirm it so? Confounded 955 be your strife,</p>
<p>And perish ye with your audacious prate 956 :</p>
<p>Presumptuous vassals 957 , are you not ashamed</p>
<p>With this immodest 958 clamorous outrage</p>
<p>To trouble and disturb the king and us?</p>
<p>And you, my lords, methinks you do not well</p>
<p>To bear with their perverse objections 959 :</p>
<p>Much less to take occasion 960 from their mouths</p>
<p>To raise a mutiny 961 betwixt yourselves.</p>
<p>Let me persuade you take a better course.</p>
<p>EXETER It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Come hither, you that would be combatants:</p>
<p>Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,</p>
<p>Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.</p>
<p>And you, my lords, remember where we are:</p>
<p>In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:</p>
<p>If they perceive dissension in our looks</p>
<p>And that within ourselves 962 we disagree,</p>
<p>How will their grudging stomachs 963 be provoked</p>
<p>To wilful disobedience, and rebel 964 !</p>
<p>Beside, what infamy will there arise,</p>
<p>When foreign princes shall be certified 965 ,</p>
<p>That for a toy 966 , a thing of no regard 967 ,</p>
<p>King Henry’s peers and chief nobility</p>
<p>Destroyed themselves, and lost the realm of France!</p>
<p>O, think upon the conquest of my father,</p>
<p>My tender years, and let us not forgo 968</p>
<p>That for a trifle that 969 was bought with blood.</p>
<p>Let me be umpire in this doubtful 970 strife:</p>
<p>I see no reason, if I wear this rose,</p>
<p>Putting on a red rose</p>
<p>That any one should therefore be suspicious 971</p>
<p>I more incline to 972 Somerset than York:</p>
<p>Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.</p>
<p>As well they may 973 upbraid me with my crown,</p>
<p>Because, forsooth 974 , the King of Scots is crowned.</p>
<p>But your discretions 975 better can persuade</p>
<p>Than I am able to instruct or teach:</p>
<p>And therefore, as we hither came in peace,</p>
<p>So let us still continue peace and love.</p>
<p>Cousin of York, we institute 976 your grace</p>
<p>To be our regent in these parts 977 of France:</p>
<p>And good my lord of Somerset, unite</p>
<p>Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot 978 ,</p>
<p>And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors 979 ,</p>
<p>Go cheerfully together and digest 980</p>
<p>Your angry choler 981 on your enemies.</p>
<p>Ourself, my Lord Protector and the rest,</p>
<p>After some respite 982 , will return to Calais;</p>
<p>From thence to England, where I hope ere long</p>
<p>To be presented, by your victories,</p>
<p>With Charles, Alençon and that traitorous rout 983 .</p>
<p>Exeunt all but York, Warwick, Exeter [and ] Vernon</p>
<p>Flourish</p>
<p>WARWICK My lord of York, I promise you, the king</p>
<p>Prettily 984 , methought, did play the orator.</p>
<p>RICHARD DUKE OF YORK And so he did: but yet I like it not,</p>
<p>In that he wears the badge of Somerset.</p>
<p>WARWICK Tush, that was but his fancy 985 , blame him not:</p>
<p>I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.</p>
<p>RICHARD DUKE OF YORK An if I wist 986 he did — but let it rest:</p>
<p>Other affairs must now be managèd.</p>
<p>Exeunt [all but ] Exeter</p>
<p>EXETER Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice:</p>
<p>For had the passions 987 of thy heart burst out,</p>
<p>I fear we should have seen deciphered 988 there</p>
<p>More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,</p>
<p>Than yet can be imagined or supposed:</p>
<p>But howsoe’er, no simple 989 man that sees</p>
<p>This jarring discord of nobility,</p>
<p>This shouldering 990 of each other in the court,</p>
<p>This factious bandying 991 of their favourites 992 ,</p>
<p>But that 993 it doth presage some ill event 994 .</p>
<p>’Tis much 995 when sceptres are in children’s hands:</p>
<p>But more, when envy 996 breeds unkind 997 division,</p>
<p>There comes the ruin, there begins confusion 998 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
