<h4 id="scene-4-running-scene-4-246">Scene 4 ／ running scene 4 246</h4>
<p>Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Masquers 247
, Torchbearers</p>
<p>ROMEO What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse 248 ?</p>
<p>Or shall we on without apology?</p>
<p>BENVOLIO The date is out of such prolixity 249 :</p>
<p>We’ll have no Cupid 250 hoodwinked 251 with a scarf,</p>
<p>Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath 252 ,</p>
<p>Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper 253 .</p>
<p>But let them measure 254 us by what they will,</p>
<p>We’ll measure them a measure 255 , and be gone.</p>
<p>ROMEO Give me a torch, I am not for this ambling 256 .</p>
<p>Being but heavy 257 , I will bear the light.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.</p>
<p>ROMEO Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes</p>
<p>With nimble soles, I have a soul of lead</p>
<p>So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO You are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,</p>
<p>And soar with them above a common bound 258 .</p>
<p>ROMEO I am too sore enpiercèd 259 with his shaft 260</p>
<p>To soar with his light feathers and so bound 261 ,</p>
<p>I cannot bound a pitch 262 above dull 263 woe:</p>
<p>Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO And to sink in it should you burden love 264 ,</p>
<p>Too great oppression 265 for a tender thing 266 .</p>
<p>ROMEO Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,</p>
<p>Too rude 267 , too boist’rous 268 , and it pricks 269 like thorn.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO If love be rough with you, be rough with love:</p>
<p>Prick 270 love for 271 pricking, and you beat love down 272 .</p>
<p>Give me a case 273 to put my visage in,</p>
<p>A visor for a visor 274 ! What care I</p>
<p>Puts on a mask</p>
<p>What curious eye doth quote 275 deformities?</p>
<p>Here are the beetle brows 276 shall blush for me.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Come, knock and enter, and no sooner in,</p>
<p>But every man betake him to his legs 277 .</p>
<p>ROMEO A torch for me: let wantons 278 light of heart 279</p>
<p>Tickle 280 the senseless 281 rushes 282 with their heels 283 ,</p>
<p>For I am proverbed with a grandsire phrase 284 ,</p>
<p>I’ll be a candle-holder, and look on 285 .</p>
<p>The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done 286 .</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word 287 :</p>
<p>If thou art dun 288 , we’ll draw thee from the mire 289</p>
<p>Or — save your reverence 290 — love, wherein thou stick’st</p>
<p>Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight 291 , ho!</p>
<p>ROMEO Nay, that’s not so.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO I mean, sir, in delay</p>
<p>We waste our lights in vain, light lights by day.</p>
<p>Take our good meaning, for our judgement sits</p>
<p>Five times in that ere once in our five wits 292 .</p>
<p>ROMEO And we mean 293 well in going to this masque,</p>
<p>But ’tis no wit 294 to go.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO Why, may one ask?</p>
<p>ROMEO I dreamt a dream tonight 295 .</p>
<p>MERCUTIO And so did I.</p>
<p>ROMEO Well, what was yours?</p>
<p>MERCUTIO That dreamers often lie.</p>
<p>ROMEO In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.</p>
<p>MERCUTIO O, then I see Queen Mab 296 hath been with you:</p>
<p>She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes</p>
<p>In shape no bigger than an agate-stone 297</p>
<p>On the forefinger of an alderman 298 ,</p>
<p>Drawn with a team of little atomies 299</p>
<p>Over men’s noses as they lie asleep:</p>
<p>Her wagon-spokes made of long spinners 300 ’ legs,</p>
<p>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,</p>
<p>Her traces 301 of the smallest spider’s web,</p>
<p>Her collars of the moonshine’s wat’ry beams,</p>
<p>Her whip of cricket’s bone, the lash 302 of film 303 ,</p>
<p>Her wagoner 304 a small grey-coated gnat,</p>
<p>Not half so big as a round little worm</p>
<p>Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid 305 ,</p>
<p>Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut</p>
<p>Made by the joiner 306 squirrel or old grub,</p>
<p>Time out o’mind the fairies’ coachmakers.</p>
<p>And in this state she gallops night by night</p>
<p>Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love,</p>
<p>On courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies 307 straight 308 ,</p>
<p>O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees,</p>
<p>O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,</p>
<p>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,</p>
<p>Because their breath with sweetmeats 309 tainted are:</p>
<p>Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,</p>
<p>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit 310 :</p>
<p>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig 311 ’s tail</p>
<p>Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,</p>
<p>Then he dreams of another benefice 312 .</p>
<p>Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,</p>
<p>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,</p>
<p>Of breaches 313 , ambuscadoes 314 , Spanish blades 315 ,</p>
<p>Of healths five-fathom deep 316 , and then anon 317</p>
<p>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,</p>
<p>And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two</p>
<p>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</p>
<p>That plaits the manes of horses in the night,</p>
<p>And bakes 318 the elflocks 319 in foul sluttish hairs,</p>
<p>Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes.</p>
<p>This is the hag 320 , when maids lie on their backs,</p>
<p>That presses them and learns 321 them first to bear,</p>
<p>Making them women of good carriage 322 :</p>
<p>This is she—</p>
<p>ROMEO Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!</p>
<p>Thou talk’st of nothing 323 .</p>
<p>MERCUTIO True, I talk of dreams,</p>
<p>Which are the children of an idle brain,</p>
<p>Begot 324 of nothing but vain 325 fantasy,</p>
<p>Which is as thin of substance as the air</p>
<p>And more inconstant than the wind, who woos</p>
<p>Even now the frozen bosom of the north,</p>
<p>And being angered puffs away from thence,</p>
<p>Turning his side 326 to the dew-dropping south.</p>
<p>BENVOLIO This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves</p>
<p>Supper is done, and we shall come too late.</p>
<p>ROMEO I fear too early, for my mind misgives 327</p>
<p>Some consequence yet hanging in the stars</p>
<p>Shall bitterly begin his fearful 328 date 329</p>
<p>With this night’s revels and expire 330 the term 331</p>
<p>Of a despisèd life closed in my breast</p>
<p>By some vile forfeit 332 of untimely death.</p>
<p>But he that hath the steerage of my course,</p>
<p>Direct my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Strike, drum 333 .</p>
<p>They march about the stage and Servingmen come forth with their
napkins</p>
<p>Enter [Chief ] Servant</p>
<p>CHIEF SERVINGMAN Where’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away 334
trencher 335 ? He shift a trencher? He scrape a trencher?</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN When good manners 336 shall lie in one or two men’s
hands and they unwashed too, ’tis a foul 337 thing.</p>
<p>CHIEF SERVINGMAN Away with the joint-stools 338 , remove the
court-cupboard 339 , look to the plate 340 . Good thou, save me a piece
of marchpane 341 , and as thou lovest me, let the porter let in Susan
Grindstone 342 and Nell.— Antony, and Potpan!</p>
<p>SECOND SERVINGMAN Ay, boy, ready.</p>
<p>CHIEF SERVINGMAN You are looked for and called for, asked for and
sought for, in the great chamber.</p>
<p>FIRST SERVINGMAN We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly 343 , boys,
be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all 344 .</p>
<p>Exeunt [some Servingmen ]</p>
<p>Enter all the Guests and Gentlewomen to the Masquers</p>
<p>CAPULET Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes</p>
<p>Unplagued with corns will walk a bout 345 with you.</p>
<p>Ah, my mistresses, which of you all</p>
<p>Will now deny 346 to dance? She that makes dainty,</p>
<p>She I’ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now? 347</p>
<p>Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day</p>
<p>That I have worn a visor and could tell</p>
<p>A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,</p>
<p>Such as would please: ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone.</p>
<p>You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.</p>
<p>Music plays, and they dance</p>
<p>A hall 348 , hall, give room! And foot it, girls.</p>
<p>More light, you knaves, and turn the tables up 349 ,</p>
<p>And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.</p>
<p>Ah, sirrah 350 , this unlooked-for 351 sport comes well.</p>
<p>Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,</p>
<p>For you and I are past our dancing days:</p>
<p>How long is’t now since last yourself and I</p>
<p>Were in a mask?</p>
<p>SECOND CAPULET By’r lady 352 , thirty years.</p>
<p>CAPULET What, man? ’Tis not so much, ’tis not so much:</p>
<p>’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,</p>
<p>Come Pentecost 353 as quickly as it will,</p>
<p>Some five and twenty years, and then we masked.</p>
<p>SECOND CAPULET ’Tis more, ’tis more, his son is elder, sir:</p>
<p>His son is thirty.</p>
<p>CAPULET Will you tell me that?</p>
<p>His son was but a ward 354 two years ago.</p>
<p>ROMEO What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand Of yonder
knight?</p>
<p>To a Servingman</p>
<p>SERVINGMAN I know not, sir.</p>
<p>ROMEO O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!</p>
<p>It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night</p>
<p>As a rich jewel in an Ethiope’s 355 ear:</p>
<p>Beauty 356 too rich for use 357 , for earth 358 too dear 359 !</p>
<p>So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,</p>
<p>As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.</p>
<p>The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand 360 ,</p>
<p>And touching hers, make blessèd my rude 361 hand.</p>
<p>Did my heart love till now? Forswear it 362 , sight,</p>
<p>For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.</p>
<p>TYBALT This, by his voice, should be a Montague.</p>
<p>Fetch me my rapier 363 , boy.— What dares the slave</p>
<p>[Exit a Servingman ]</p>
<p>Come hither, covered with an antic 364 face,</p>
<p>To fleer 365 and scorn at our solemnity 366 ?</p>
<p>Now, by the stock 367 and honour of my kin,</p>
<p>To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.</p>
<p>CAPULET Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?</p>
<p>TYBALT Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,</p>
<p>A villain that is hither come in spite,</p>
<p>To scorn at our solemnity this night.</p>
<p>CAPULET Young Romeo is it?</p>
<p>TYBALT ’Tis he, that villain Romeo.</p>
<p>CAPULET Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone:</p>
<p>A bears him like a portly 368 gentleman,</p>
<p>And to say truth, Verona brags of him</p>
<p>To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.</p>
<p>I would not for the wealth of all this town</p>
<p>Here in my house do him disparagement:</p>
<p>Therefore be patient, take no note of him.</p>
<p>It is my will, the which if thou respect,</p>
<p>Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,</p>
<p>An ill-beseeming semblance 369 for a feast.</p>
<p>TYBALT It fits when such a villain is a guest:</p>
<p>I’ll not endure him.</p>
<p>CAPULET He shall be endured.</p>
<p>What, goodman boy 370 ? I say, he shall: go to 371 .</p>
<p>Am I the master here or you? Go to.</p>
<p>You’ll not endure him? God shall mend my soul 372 ,</p>
<p>You’ll make a mutiny among my guests?</p>
<p>You will set cock-a-hoop 373 ? You’ll be the man 374 ?</p>
<p>TYBALT Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.</p>
<p>CAPULET Go to, go to.</p>
<p>You are a saucy 375 scathe boy. Is’t so, indeed?</p>
<p>This trick may chance to scathe 376 you, I know what 377 .</p>
<p>You must contrary 378 me? Marry, ’tis time 379 .—</p>
<p>Well said 380 perforce 381 , my hearts 382 !— You are a princox 383 .
Go,</p>
<p>To Dancers/To Tybalt</p>
<p>Be quiet, or— More light, more light!— for shame,</p>
<p>To Servants/To Tybalt</p>
<p>I’ll make you quiet.— What, cheerly, my hearts!</p>
<p>To Dancers</p>
<p>TYBALT Patience perforce with wilful choler 384 meeting</p>
<p>Makes my flesh tremble in their different 385 greeting.</p>
<p>I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall</p>
<p>Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>ROMEO If I profane 386 with my unworthiest hand</p>
<p>To Juliet</p>
<p>This holy shrine 387 , the gentle sin is this:</p>
<p>My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand</p>
<p>To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.</p>
<p>JULIET Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,</p>
<p>Which mannerly devotion shows in this 388 ,</p>
<p>For saints 389 have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,</p>
<p>And palm to palm is holy palmers 390 ’ kiss.</p>
<p>ROMEO Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?</p>
<p>JULIET Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.</p>
<p>ROMEO O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do:</p>
<p>They pray, grant thou 391 , lest faith turn to despair.</p>
<p>JULIET Saints do not move 392 , though grant for prayers’ sake.</p>
<p>ROMEO Then move not, while my prayer’s effect I take.</p>
<p>Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged 393 .</p>
<p>Kisses her</p>
<p>JULIET Then have my lips the sin that they have took.</p>
<p>ROMEO Sin from my lips? O, trespass sweetly urged!</p>
<p>Give me my sin again.</p>
<p>Kisses her again</p>
<p>JULIET You kiss by th’book 394 .</p>
<p>NURSE Madam, your mother craves a word with you.</p>
<p>Juliet stands aside</p>
<p>ROMEO What 395 is her mother?</p>
<p>NURSE Marry, bachelor 396 ,</p>
<p>Her mother is the lady of the house,</p>
<p>And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.</p>
<p>I nursed her daughter, that you talked withal 397 .</p>
<p>I tell you, he that can lay hold of 398 her</p>
<p>Shall have the chinks 399 .</p>
<p>ROMEO Is she a Capulet?</p>
<p>Aside?</p>
<p>O, dear account 400 ! My life is my foe’s debt 401 .</p>
<p>BENVOLIO Away, begone, the sport is at the best 402 .</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>ROMEO Ay, so I fear, the more is my unrest.</p>
<p>CAPULET Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,</p>
<p>The guests indicate that they have to leave</p>
<p>We have a trifling foolish banquet 403 towards 404 .</p>
<p>Is it e’en so? Why then I thank you all.</p>
<p>I thank you, honest 405 gentlemen, goodnight.—</p>
<p>More torches here!— Come on, then let’s to bed.</p>
<p>To Servingmen</p>
<p>Ah, sirrah, by my fay 406 , it waxes late:</p>
<p>I’ll to my rest.</p>
<p>[Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse ]</p>
<p>JULIET Come hither, nurse. What is yond 407 gentleman?</p>
<p>NURSE The son and heir of old Tiberio.</p>
<p>JULIET What’s he that now is going out of door?</p>
<p>NURSE Marry, that I think be young Petruchio.</p>
<p>JULIET What’s he that follows here, that would not dance?</p>
<p>NURSE I know not.</p>
<p>JULIET Go ask his name.— If he be marrièd,</p>
<p>The Nurse goes</p>
<p>My grave is like 408 to be my wedding bed.</p>
<p>NURSE His name is Romeo, and a Montague,</p>
<p>Returning</p>
<p>The only son of your great enemy.</p>
<p>JULIET My only love sprung from my only hate!</p>
<p>Too early seen unknown, and known too late!</p>
<p>Prodigious 409 birth of love it is to me,</p>
<p>That I must love a loathèd enemy.</p>
<p>NURSE What’s this? What’s this?</p>
<p>JULIET A rhyme I learned even now</p>
<p>Of one I danced withal.</p>
<p>One calls within ‘Juliet!’</p>
<p>NURSE Anon 410 , anon!</p>
<p>Come, let’s away: the strangers all are gone.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
<p>[Enter ] Chorus</p>
<p>CHORUS Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,</p>
<p>And young affection gapes 411 to be his heir:</p>
<p>That fair 412 for which love groaned for and would die 413 ,</p>
<p>With tender Juliet matched 414 , is now not fair.</p>
<p>Now Romeo is beloved and loves again 415 ,</p>
<p>Alike 416 bewitchèd by the charm of looks 417 ,</p>
<p>But to his foe supposed 418 he must complain 419 ,</p>
<p>And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful 420 hooks.</p>
<p>Being held a foe, he may not have access</p>
<p>To breathe such vows as lovers use 421 to swear,</p>
<p>And she as much in love, her means much less</p>
<p>To meet her new-belovèd anywhere:</p>
<p>But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,</p>
<p>Temp’ring extremities 422 with extreme sweet.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
