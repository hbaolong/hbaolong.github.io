<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-5">Scene 1 ／ running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter Mistress Page</p>
<p>With a letter</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE What, have I scaped 334 love-letters in the
holiday-time 335 of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them? Let me
see: ’Ask me no reason why I love you, for though Love use Reason for
his precisian 336 , he admits him not for his counsellor 337 . You are
not young, no more am I: go to then, there’s sympathy 338 . You are
merry, so am I: ha, ha, then there’s more sympathy. You love sack 339 ,
and so do I: would you desire better sympathy? Let it suffice thee,
Mistress Page, at the least if the love of soldier can suffice, that I
love thee. I will not say, pity me — ’tis not a soldier-like phrase —
but I say, love me. By me,</p>
<p>Reads</p>
<p>Thine own true knight,</p>
<p>By day or night,</p>
<p>Or any kind of light,</p>
<p>With all his might</p>
<p>For thee to fight,</p>
<p>John Falstaff.’</p>
<p>What a Herod of Jewry 340 is this? O wicked, wicked world! One that
is well-nigh worn to pieces with age, to show himself a young gallant
341 ? What an unweighed 342 behaviour hath this Flemish 343 drunkard
picked — with the devil’s name — out of my conversation, that he dares
in this manner assay me? Why, he hath not been thrice in my company!
What should I say 344 to him? I was then frugal of my mirth — heaven
forgive me! Why, I’ll exhibit a bill in the parliament for the putting
down 345 of men. How shall I be revenged on him? For revenged I will be,
as sure as his guts are made of puddings 346 .</p>
<p>[Enter Mistress Ford ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Mistress Page, trust me 347 , I was going to your
house.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very ill
348 .</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Nay, I’ll ne’er believe that; I have 349 to show to the
contrary.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Faith, but you do, in my mind.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Well, I do then: yet I say I could show you to the
contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE What’s the matter, woman?</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect 350 ,
I could come to such honour!</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Hang the trifle, woman, take the honour. What is it?
Dispense with trifles: what is it?</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD If I would but go to hell 351 for an eternal moment or
so, I could be knighted.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE What? Thou liest! Sir Alice Ford? These knights will
hack 352 , and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry 353
.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD We burn daylight 354 . Here, read, read. Perceive how I
might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat men, as long as I have
an eye to make difference of men’s liking 355 . And yet he would not
swear, praised women’s modesty, and gave such orderly and well-behaved
reproof to all uncomeliness 356 , that I would have sworn his
disposition would have gone to the truth of 357 his words. But they do
no more adhere and keep place together than the hundred Psalms to the
tune of ‘Greensleeves’ 358 . What tempest, I trow, threw this whale —
with so many tuns 359 of oil in his belly — ashore at Windsor? How shall
I be revenged on him? I think the best way were to entertain 360 him
with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own
grease. Did you ever hear the like?</p>
<p>Gives letter to Mistress Page</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and Ford
differs. To thy great comfort in this mystery of ill opinions 361 ,
here’s the twin-brother of thy letter. But let thine inherit 362 first,
for I protest mine never shall. I warrant he hath a thousand of these
letters, writ with blank space for different names — sure, more — and
these are of the second edition. He will print them, out of doubt, for
he cares not what he puts into the press 363 , when he would put us two.
I had rather be a giantess, and lie under Mount Pelion 364 . Well, I
will find you twenty lascivious turtles 365 ere 366 one chaste man.</p>
<p>Shows her own letter</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Why, this is the very same: the very hand 367 , the
very words. What doth he think of us?</p>
<p>Compares the two letters</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Nay, I know not. It makes me almost ready to wrangle
with mine own honesty 368 . I’ll entertain 369 myself like one that I am
not acquainted withal: for, sure, unless he know some strain 370 in me
that I know not myself, he would never have boarded 371 me in this fury
372 .</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD ‘Boarding’, call you it? I’ll be sure to keep him above
deck 373 .</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE So will I: if he come 374 under my hatches 375 , I’ll
never to sea again. Let’s be revenged on him. Let’s appoint him a
meeting, give him a show of comfort in his suit 376 and lead him on with
a fine-baited 377 delay, till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of
the Garter.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Nay, I will consent to act any villainy against him
that may not sully the chariness 378 of our honesty. O, that my husband
saw this letter! It would give eternal food to his jealousy.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Why, look where he comes, and my good man too: he’s as
far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause, and that—I hope—is an
unmeasurable distance.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD You are the happier woman.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Let’s consult together against this greasy knight. Come
hither.</p>
<p>They withdraw</p>
<p>[Enter Ford with Pistol, and Page with Nim ]</p>
<p>FORD Well, I hope it be not so.</p>
<p>PISTOL Hope is a curtal 379 dog in some affairs.</p>
<p>Sir John affects 380 thy wife.</p>
<p>FORD Why, sir, my wife is not young.</p>
<p>PISTOL He woos both high and low, both rich and poor,</p>
<p>Both young and old, one with another, Ford.</p>
<p>He loves the gallimaufry 381 , Ford, perpend 382 .</p>
<p>FORD Love my wife?</p>
<p>PISTOL With liver 383 burning hot. Prevent 384 ,</p>
<p>Or go thou like Sir Actaeon 385 , he</p>
<p>With Ringwood 386 at thy 387 heels.</p>
<p>O, odious is the name 388 !</p>
<p>FORD What name, sir?</p>
<p>PISTOL The horn, I say. Farewell.</p>
<p>Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot 389 by night.</p>
<p>Take heed, ere summer comes, or cuckoo-birds 390 do sing.</p>
<p>Away 391 , Sir Corporal Nim!</p>
<p>Believe it, Page, he speaks sense.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>FORD I will be patient. I will find out this.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>NIM And this is true, I like not the humour of lying. He hath wronged
me in some humours: I should have borne 392 the humoured letter to her,
but I have a sword, and it shall bite upon my necessity 393 . He loves
your wife: there’s the short and the long. My name is Corporal Nim. I
speak and I avouch ’tis true: my name is Nim, and Falstaff loves your
wife. Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese 394 . Adieu.</p>
<p>To Page</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>PAGE ‘The humour of it’, quoth a 395 ! Here’s a fellow frights
English out of his 396 wits.</p>
<p>FORD I will seek out Falstaff.</p>
<p>PAGE I never heard such a drawling, affecting 397 rogue.</p>
<p>FORD If I do find it 398 — well.</p>
<p>PAGE I will not believe such a Cataian 399 , though 400 the priest
o’th’town commended him for a true man.</p>
<p>FORD ’Twas a good sensible fellow — well.</p>
<p>PAGE How now, Meg?</p>
<p>Mistress Page and Mistress Ford come forward</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Whither go you, George? Hark you.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD How now, sweet Frank, why art thou melancholy?</p>
<p>FORD I melancholy? I am not melancholy. Get you home, go.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Faith, thou hast some crotchets 401 in thy head now.—
Will you go, Mistress Page?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Have with you 402 .— You’ll come to dinner,
George?—</p>
<p>Look who comes yonder: she shall be our messenger to this paltry
knight.</p>
<p>Aside to Mistress Ford</p>
<p>[Enter Mistress Quickly ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Trust me, I thought on her: she’ll fit it 403 .</p>
<p>Aside to Mistress Page</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE You are come to see my daughter Anne?</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Ay, forsooth, and I pray how does good Mistress
Anne?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Go in with us and see. We have an hour’s talk with
you.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Mistress Page, Mistress Ford and Mistress Quickly ]</p>
<p>PAGE How now, Master Ford?</p>
<p>FORD You heard what this knave told me, did you not?</p>
<p>PAGE Yes, and you heard what the other told me?</p>
<p>FORD Do you think there is truth in them?</p>
<p>PAGE Hang ’em, slaves! I do not think the knight would offer 404 it.
But these that accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke 405
of his discarded men: very rogues, now they be out of service.</p>
<p>FORD Were they his men?</p>
<p>PAGE Marry, were they.</p>
<p>FORD I like it never the better for that. Does he lie 406 at the
Garter?</p>
<p>PAGE Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage 407 toward
my wife, I would turn her loose to him, and what he gets more of her
than sharp words, let it lie on my head 408 .</p>
<p>FORD I do not misdoubt 409 my wife, but I would be loath to turn them
410 together. A man may be too confident. I would have nothing lie on my
head. I cannot be thus satisfied.</p>
<p>PAGE Look where my ranting 411 host of the Garter comes: there is
either liquor in his pate 412 or money in his purse, when he looks so
merrily.</p>
<p>[Enter Host ]</p>
<p>How now, mine host?</p>
<p>HOST How now, bully-rook? Thou’rt a gentleman.</p>
<p>[Enter Shallow ]</p>
<p>Cavaliero 413 Justice, I say!</p>
<p>SHALLOW I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and twenty 414 ,
good Master Page. Master Page, will you go with us? We have sport in
hand.</p>
<p>HOST Tell him, Cavaliero Justice: tell him, bully-rook.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh the Welsh
priest and Caius the French doctor.</p>
<p>FORD Good mine host o’th’Garter, a word with you.</p>
<p>They speak apart</p>
<p>HOST What sayst thou, my bully-rook?</p>
<p>SHALLOW Will you go with us to behold it? My merry host hath had the
measuring of their weapons, and, I think, hath appointed them contrary
415 places, for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester 416 . Hark,
I will tell you what our sport shall be.</p>
<p>To Page</p>
<p>They speak apart</p>
<p>HOST Hast thou no suit against my knight, my guest-cavalier 417 ?</p>
<p>FORD None, I protest 418 . But I’ll give you a pottle 419 of burned
sack 420 to give me recourse 421 to him, and tell him my name is Broom,
only for a jest.</p>
<p>HOST My hand, bully. Thou shalt have egress and regress 422 — said I
well? — and thy name shall be Broom. It is a merry knight.— Will you go,
An-heires 423 ?</p>
<p>To Shallow and Page</p>
<p>SHALLOW Have with you, mine host.</p>
<p>PAGE I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in his rapier.</p>
<p>SHALLOW Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these times you
stand on distance 424 : your passes, stoccadoes 425 , and I know not
what. ’Tis the heart 426 , Master Page, ’tis here, ’tis here. I have
seen the time, with my long sword 427 , I would have made you four tall
428 fellows skip like rats.</p>
<p>HOST Here, boys, here, here! Shall we wag 429 ?</p>
<p>PAGE Have with you. I had rather hear them scold 430 than fight.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Host, Shallow and Page ]</p>
<p>FORD Though Page be a secure 431 fool, and stands so firmly on his
wife’s frailty 432 , yet I cannot put off my opinion so easily. She was
in his 433 company at Page’s house, and what they made 434 there I know
not. Well, I will look further into’t, and I have a disguise to sound
435 Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not my labour: if she be
otherwise, ’tis labour well bestowed.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
