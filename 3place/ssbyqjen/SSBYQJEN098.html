<h4 id="scene-1-1-running-scene-1">Scene 1 1 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter Duke of Ephesus 2 with [Egeon ] the merchant of Syracuse 3 ,
Jailer and other Attendants</p>
<p>EGEON Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,</p>
<p>And by the doom 4 of death end woes and all.</p>
<p>DUKE Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more.</p>
<p>I am not partial 5 to infringe our laws;</p>
<p>The enmity and discord which of late</p>
<p>Sprung from the rancorous outrage 6 of your duke</p>
<p>To merchants, our well-dealing 7 countrymen,</p>
<p>Who, wanting 8 guilders 9 to redeem 10 their lives,</p>
<p>Have sealed 11 his rigorous statutes 12 with their bloods,</p>
<p>Excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks,</p>
<p>For, since the mortal 13 and intestine 14 jars 15</p>
<p>’Twixt thy seditious 16 countrymen and us,</p>
<p>It hath in solemn synods 17 been decreed,</p>
<p>Both by the Syracusans and ourselves,</p>
<p>To admit no traffic to 18 our adverse 19 towns.</p>
<p>Nay, more: if any born at Ephesus</p>
<p>Be seen at any Syracusan marts 20 and fairs,</p>
<p>Again, if any Syracusan born</p>
<p>Come to 21 the bay of Ephesus, he dies:</p>
<p>His goods confiscate to the duke’s dispose 22 ,</p>
<p>Unless a thousand marks 23 be levièd 24</p>
<p>To quit 25 the penalty and to ransom him.</p>
<p>Thy substance 26 , valued at the highest rate,</p>
<p>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks,</p>
<p>Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.</p>
<p>EGEON Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,</p>
<p>My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</p>
<p>DUKE Well, Syracusan, say in brief the cause</p>
<p>Why thou departed’st from thy native home,</p>
<p>And for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus.</p>
<p>EGEON A heavier 27 task could not have been imposed</p>
<p>Than I 28 to speak my griefs unspeakable.</p>
<p>Yet, that 29 the world may witness that my end</p>
<p>Was wrought by nature 30 , not by vile offence,</p>
<p>I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave 31 .</p>
<p>In Syracusa was I born, and wed</p>
<p>Unto a woman, happy but 32 for me,</p>
<p>And by me, had not our hap been bad 33 .</p>
<p>With her I lived in joy, our wealth increased</p>
<p>By prosperous voyages I often made</p>
<p>To Epidamium 34 , till my factor’s 35 death</p>
<p>And the great care of goods at random 36 left,</p>
<p>Drew me from kind embracements 37 of my spouse;</p>
<p>From whom my absence was not six months old</p>
<p>Before herself — almost at fainting under</p>
<p>The pleasing punishment 38 that women bear —</p>
<p>Had made provision for her following me,</p>
<p>And soon and safe arrivèd where I was.</p>
<p>There had she not been long, but she became</p>
<p>A joyful mother of two goodly sons,</p>
<p>And, which was strange, the one so like the other,</p>
<p>As could not be distinguished but by names.</p>
<p>That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</p>
<p>A poor mean 39 woman was deliverèd</p>
<p>Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.</p>
<p>Those, for 40 their parents were exceeding poor,</p>
<p>I bought, and brought up to attend 41 my sons.</p>
<p>My wife, not meanly 42 proud of two such boys,</p>
<p>Made daily motions 43 for our home return.</p>
<p>Unwilling I agreed. Alas, too soon we came aboard.</p>
<p>A league 44 from Epidamium had we sailed</p>
<p>Before the always wind-obeying deep 45</p>
<p>Gave any tragic instance 46 of our harm.</p>
<p>But longer did we not retain much hope,</p>
<p>For what obscurèd light the heavens did grant</p>
<p>Did but convey unto our fearful minds</p>
<p>A doubtful warrant 47 of immediate death,</p>
<p>Which though myself would gladly have embraced,</p>
<p>Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</p>
<p>Weeping before for 48 what she saw must come,</p>
<p>And piteous plainings 49 of the pretty babes,</p>
<p>That mourned for fashion 50 , ignorant what to fear,</p>
<p>Forced me to seek delays 51 for them and me.</p>
<p>And this it was 52 — for other means was none —</p>
<p>The sailors sought for safety by our boat 53 ,</p>
<p>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe 54 , to us.</p>
<p>My wife, more careful 55 for the latter-born 56 ,</p>
<p>Had fastened him unto a small spare mast,</p>
<p>Such as seafaring men provide for storms:</p>
<p>To him one of the other twins was bound,</p>
<p>Whilst I had been like 57 heedful of the other.</p>
<p>The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</p>
<p>Fixing our eyes on whom 58 our care was fixed,</p>
<p>Fastened ourselves at either end the 59 mast,</p>
<p>And floating straight 60 , obedient to the stream 61 ,</p>
<p>Was carried towards Corinth 62 , as we thought.</p>
<p>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</p>
<p>Dispersed those vapours 63 that offended 64 us,</p>
<p>And by the benefit 65 of his wishèd light,</p>
<p>The seas waxed calm, and we discoverèd</p>
<p>Two ships from far, making amain 66 to us,</p>
<p>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus 67 this.</p>
<p>But ere 68 they came — O, let me say no more.</p>
<p>Gather the sequel by that 69 went before.</p>
<p>DUKE Nay, forward 70 , old man, do not break off so,</p>
<p>For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</p>
<p>EGEON O, had the gods done so, I had not now</p>
<p>Worthily 71 termed them merciless to us:</p>
<p>For ere the ships could meet by 72 twice five leagues 73 ,</p>
<p>We were encountered by a mighty rock,</p>
<p>Which being violently borne up upon,</p>
<p>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst,</p>
<p>So that in this unjust divorce of us,</p>
<p>Fortune had left to both of us alike</p>
<p>What 74 to delight in, what to sorrow for.</p>
<p>Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened</p>
<p>With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,</p>
<p>Was carried with more speed before the wind,</p>
<p>And in our sight they three were taken up</p>
<p>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</p>
<p>At length, another ship had seized on us 75 ,</p>
<p>And knowing whom it was their hap 76 to save,</p>
<p>Gave healthful welcome to their shipwrecked guests,</p>
<p>And would have reft the fishers of their prey 77 ,</p>
<p>Had not their bark 78 been very slow of sail,</p>
<p>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</p>
<p>Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss,</p>
<p>That by misfortunes was my life prolonged,</p>
<p>To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</p>
<p>DUKE And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</p>
<p>Do me the favour to dilate 79 at full</p>
<p>What have befall’n of 80 them and thee till now.</p>
<p>EGEON My youngest boy, and yet my eldest 81 care,</p>
<p>At eighteen years became inquisitive</p>
<p>After 82 his brother, and importuned 83 me</p>
<p>That his attendant 84 — for his case was like 85 ,</p>
<p>Reft of his brother, but retained his name 86 —</p>
<p>Might bear him company in the quest of 87 him:</p>
<p>Whom whilst I laboured of a love 88 to see,</p>
<p>I hazarded the loss of whom I loved 89 .</p>
<p>Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,</p>
<p>Roaming clean 90 through the bounds 91 of Asia,</p>
<p>And coasting 92 homeward, came to Ephesus,</p>
<p>Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</p>
<p>Or 93 that or any place that harbours men.</p>
<p>But here must end the story of my life,</p>
<p>And happy were I in my timely death,</p>
<p>Could all my travels 94 warrant 95 me they live.</p>
<p>DUKE Hapless 96 Egeon, whom the fates have marked</p>
<p>To bear the extremity of dire mishap.</p>
<p>Now trust me, were it not against our laws,</p>
<p>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</p>
<p>Which princes, would 97 they, may not disannul 98 ,</p>
<p>My soul should sue 99 as advocate for thee.</p>
<p>But, though thou art adjudgèd 100 to the death,</p>
<p>And passèd sentence may not be recalled</p>
<p>But 101 to our honour’s great disparagement 102 ,</p>
<p>Yet will I favour thee in what I can;</p>
<p>Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit 103 thee this day</p>
<p>To seek thy health 104 by beneficial help.</p>
<p>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus,</p>
<p>Beg thou or borrow to make up the sum,</p>
<p>And live. If no, then thou art doomed to die.</p>
<p>Jailer, take him to thy custody.</p>
<p>JAILER I will, my lord.</p>
<p>EGEON Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend 105 ,</p>
<p>But to procrastinate 106 his lifeless end.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
