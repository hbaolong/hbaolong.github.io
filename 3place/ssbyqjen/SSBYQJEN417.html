<h4 id="scene-1-2-running-scene-1">Scene 1 2 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant (a Mercer 3 ) at several 4
doors</p>
<p>POET Good day, sir.</p>
<p>PAINTER I am glad you’re well.</p>
<p>POET I have not seen you long 5 . How goes the world? 6</p>
<p>PAINTER It wears 7 , sir, as it grows 8 .</p>
<p>POET Ay, that’s well known.</p>
<p>But what particular rarity 9 ? What strange 10 ,</p>
<p>Which manifold record 11 not matches 12 ? See,</p>
<p>Magic of bounty 13 , all these spirits 14 thy power</p>
<p>Hath conjured 15 to attend 16 . I know the merchant.</p>
<p>PAINTER I know them both: th’other’s a jeweller.</p>
<p>MERCHANT O, ’tis a worthy lord.</p>
<p>To Jeweller</p>
<p>JEWELLER Nay, that’s most fixed 17 .</p>
<p>MERCHANT A most incomparable man, breathed 18 , as it were,</p>
<p>To an untirable and continuate 19 goodness:</p>
<p>He passes 20 .</p>
<p>JEWELLER I have a jewel here—</p>
<p>MERCHANT O, pray let’s see’t. For the lord Timon, sir?</p>
<p>JEWELLER If he will touch the estimate 21 . But for that—</p>
<p>POET ’When we 22 for recompense 23 have praised the vile,</p>
<p>Recites</p>
<p>It stains the glory in that happy 24 verse</p>
<p>Which aptly 25 sings the good.’</p>
<p>MERCHANT ’Tis a good form 26 .</p>
<p>Looks at the jewel</p>
<p>JEWELLER And rich 27 : here is a water 28 , look ye.</p>
<p>PAINTER You are rapt 29 , sir, in some work, some dedication 30</p>
<p>To Poet</p>
<p>To the great lord.</p>
<p>POET A thing slipped idly 31 from me.</p>
<p>Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes</p>
<p>From whence ’tis nourished. The fire i’th’flint</p>
<p>Shows not till it be struck: our gentle flame</p>
<p>Provokes itself 32 and like the current 33 flies 34</p>
<p>Each bound 35 it chafes 36 . What have you there?</p>
<p>PAINTER A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?</p>
<p>POET Upon the heels of my presentment 37 , sir.</p>
<p>Let’s see your piece.</p>
<p>PAINTER ’Tis a good piece.</p>
<p>Shows the painting</p>
<p>POET So ’tis: this comes off 38 well and excellent.</p>
<p>PAINTER Indifferent 39 .</p>
<p>POET Admirable. How this grace</p>
<p>Speaks his own standing 40 ! What a mental power</p>
<p>This eye shoots forth! How big 41 imagination</p>
<p>Moves 42 in this lip! To th’dumbness of the gesture</p>
<p>One might interpret 43 .</p>
<p>PAINTER It is a pretty 44 mocking 45 of the life.</p>
<p>Here is a touch 46 : is’t good?</p>
<p>POET I will say of it,</p>
<p>It tutors nature 47 : artificial strife 48</p>
<p>Lives in these touches livelier 49 than life.</p>
<p>Enter certain Senators</p>
<p>They pass over the stage</p>
<p>PAINTER How this lord is followed 50 .</p>
<p>POET The senators of Athens, happy men.</p>
<p>PAINTER Look, more.</p>
<p>POET You see this confluence 51 , this great flood of visitors.</p>
<p>I have in this rough work shaped out a man</p>
<p>Shows the poem</p>
<p>Whom this beneath world 52 doth embrace and hug</p>
<p>With amplest entertainment 53 : my free drift 54</p>
<p>Halts not particularly 55 , but moves itself</p>
<p>In a wide sea of wax 56 — no levelled 57 malice</p>
<p>Infects one comma 58 in the course I hold —</p>
<p>But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,</p>
<p>Leaving no tract 59 behind.</p>
<p>PAINTER How shall I understand you? 60</p>
<p>POET I will unbolt 61 to you.</p>
<p>You see how all conditions 62 , how all minds,</p>
<p>As well of glib 63 and slipp’ry 64 creatures as</p>
<p>Of grave 65 and austere 66 quality 67 , tender down 68</p>
<p>Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune</p>
<p>Upon his good and gracious nature hanging 69</p>
<p>Subdues 70 and properties 71 to his love and tendance 72</p>
<p>All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced 73 flatterer</p>
<p>To Apemantus, that few things loves better</p>
<p>Than to abhor 74 himself — even he drops down</p>
<p>The knee 75 before him, and returns 76 in peace</p>
<p>Most rich in Timon’s nod 77 .</p>
<p>PAINTER I saw them speak together.</p>
<p>POET Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill</p>
<p>Feigned 78 Fortune to be throned: the base o’th’mount</p>
<p>Is ranked with all deserts 79 , all kind of natures</p>
<p>That labour on the bosom of this sphere 80</p>
<p>To propagate 81 their states 82 , amongst them all</p>
<p>Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady 83 fixed</p>
<p>One do I personate 84 of Lord Timon’s frame 85 ,</p>
<p>Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts 86 to her,</p>
<p>Whose 87 present grace to present slaves and servants</p>
<p>Translates his rivals 88 .</p>
<p>PAINTER ’Tis conceived to scope 89 .</p>
<p>This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,</p>
<p>With one man beckoned from the rest below,</p>
<p>Bowing his head against 90 the steepy mount</p>
<p>To climb his happiness, would be well expressed</p>
<p>In our condition 91 .</p>
<p>POET Nay, sir, but hear me on 92 .</p>
<p>All those which were his fellows 93 but of late 94 ,</p>
<p>Some better than his value 95 , on the moment</p>
<p>Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance 96 ,</p>
<p>Rain sacrificial 97 whisperings in his ear,</p>
<p>Make sacred even his stirrup 98 , and through him</p>
<p>Drink the free air 99 .</p>
<p>PAINTER Ay, marry 100 , what of these?</p>
<p>POET When Fortune in her shift and change of mood</p>
<p>Spurns down 101 her late belovèd, all his dependants,</p>
<p>Which laboured after him to the mountain’s top</p>
<p>Even on their knees and hands, let him fly down,</p>
<p>Not one accompanying his declining 102 foot.</p>
<p>PAINTER ’Tis common:</p>
<p>A thousand moral paintings I can show</p>
<p>That shall demonstrate these quick 103 blows of Fortune’s</p>
<p>More pregnantly 104 than words. Yet you do well</p>
<p>To show Lord Timon that mean 105 eyes have seen</p>
<p>The foot above the head 106 .</p>
<p>Trumpets sound. Enter Lord Timon [with Lucilius and other servants
following ], addressing himself courteously to every suitor 107 [and
then speaking with a Messenger ]</p>
<p>TIMON Imprisoned is he, say you?</p>
<p>MESSENGER Ay, my good lord: five talents 108 is his debt,</p>
<p>His means 109 most short, his creditors most strait 110 .</p>
<p>Your honourable letter he desires</p>
<p>To those have shut him up, which failing,</p>
<p>Periods 111 his comfort 112 .</p>
<p>TIMON Noble Ventidius! Well,</p>
<p>I am not of that feather 113 to shake off</p>
<p>My friend when he must need me. I do know him</p>
<p>A gentleman that well deserves a help,</p>
<p>Which he shall have: I’ll pay the debt and free him.</p>
<p>MESSENGER Your lordship ever binds him 114 .</p>
<p>TIMON Commend me 115 to him. I will send his ransom,</p>
<p>And being enfranchised 116 , bid him come to me:</p>
<p>’Tis not enough to help the feeble up,</p>
<p>But to support him after. Fare you well.</p>
<p>MESSENGER All happiness to your honour.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter an old Athenian</p>
<p>OLD MAN Lord Timon, hear me speak.</p>
<p>TIMON Freely, good father 117 .</p>
<p>OLD MAN Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.</p>
<p>TIMON I have so: what of him?</p>
<p>OLD MAN Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.</p>
<p>TIMON Attends he here or no? Lucilius!</p>
<p>Calls</p>
<p>LUCILIUS Here, at your lordship’s service.</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>OLD MAN This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature 118 ,</p>
<p>By night frequents my house. I am a man</p>
<p>That from my first 119 have been inclined to thrift 120 ,</p>
<p>And my estate deserves an heir more raised 121</p>
<p>Than one which holds a trencher 122 123 .</p>
<p>TIMON Well, what further?</p>
<p>OLD MAN One only daughter have I, no kin else</p>
<p>On whom I may confer what I have got:</p>
<p>The maid is fair, o’th’youngest for a bride 124 ,</p>
<p>And I have bred 125 her at my dearest cost</p>
<p>In qualities 126 of the best. This man of thine</p>
<p>Attempts 127 her love: I prithee, noble lord,</p>
<p>Join with me to forbid him her resort 128 ,</p>
<p>Myself have spoke in vain.</p>
<p>TIMON The man is honest 129 .</p>
<p>OLD MAN Therefore he will be 130 , Timon:</p>
<p>His honesty rewards him in itself,</p>
<p>It must not bear 131 my daughter.</p>
<p>TIMON Does she love him?</p>
<p>OLD MAN She is young and apt 132 :</p>
<p>Our own precedent 133 passions do instruct us</p>
<p>What levity 134 ’s in youth.</p>
<p>TIMON Love you the maid?</p>
<p>To Lucilius</p>
<p>LUCILIUS Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.</p>
<p>OLD MAN If in her marriage my consent be missing,</p>
<p>I call the gods to witness, I will choose</p>
<p>Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,</p>
<p>And dispossess her all 135 .</p>
<p>TIMON How shall she be endowed 136</p>
<p>If she be mated with an equal husband?</p>
<p>OLD MAN Three talents on the present; in future, all.</p>
<p>TIMON This gentleman 137 of mine hath served me long:</p>
<p>To build his fortune I will strain a little,</p>
<p>For ’tis a bond 138 in men. Give him thy daughter:</p>
<p>What you bestow, in him I’ll counterpoise 139 ,</p>
<p>And make him weigh with 140 her.</p>
<p>OLD MAN Most noble lord,</p>
<p>Pawn me to this your honour 141 , she is his.</p>
<p>TIMON My hand to thee: mine honour on my promise.</p>
<p>LUCILIUS Humbly I thank your lordship: never may</p>
<p>That state 142 or fortune fall into my keeping,</p>
<p>Which is not owed to you!</p>
<p>Exeunt [Lucilius and Old Man ]</p>
<p>POET Vouchsafe 143 my labour, and long live your lordship!</p>
<p>Presents the poem</p>
<p>TIMON I thank you. You shall hear from me anon 144 :</p>
<p>Go not away.— What have you there, my friend?</p>
<p>To the Painter</p>
<p>PAINTER A piece of painting, which I do beseech</p>
<p>Your lordship to accept.</p>
<p>Presents the painting</p>
<p>TIMON Painting is welcome.</p>
<p>The painting is almost the natural man 145 ,</p>
<p>For since dishonour traffics 146 with man’s nature,</p>
<p>He is but outside 147 : these pencilled 148 figures are</p>
<p>Even such as they give out 149 . I like your work,</p>
<p>And you shall find I like it 150 : wait attendance</p>
<p>Till you hear further from me.</p>
<p>PAINTER The gods preserve ye!</p>
<p>TIMON Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand,</p>
<p>We must needs 151 dine together.— Sir, your jewel</p>
<p>To the Jeweller</p>
<p>Hath suffered under praise 152 .</p>
<p>JEWELLER What, my lord, dispraise?</p>
<p>TIMON A mere satiety 153 of commendations.</p>
<p>If I should pay you for’t as ’tis extolled 154</p>
<p>It would unclew 155 me quite.</p>
<p>JEWELLER My lord, ’tis rated 156</p>
<p>As those which sell would give 157 : but you well know</p>
<p>Things of like 158 value differing in the owners</p>
<p>Are prized by their masters 159 . Believe’t, dear lord,</p>
<p>You mend 160 the jewel by the wearing it.</p>
<p>Presents the jewel</p>
<p>TIMON Well mocked 161 .</p>
<p>Enter Apemantus</p>
<p>MERCHANT No, my good lord, he speaks the common tongue 162</p>
<p>Which all men speak with him.</p>
<p>TIMON Look, who comes here. Will you be chid? 163</p>
<p>JEWELLER We’ll bear with your lordship.</p>
<p>MERCHANT He’ll spare none.</p>
<p>TIMON Good morrow 164 to thee, gentle 165 Apemantus!</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Till I be gentle, stay 166 thou for thy good morrow —</p>
<p>When 167 thou art Timon’s dog, and these knaves honest.</p>
<p>TIMON Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know’st them not.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Are they not Athenians?</p>
<p>TIMON Yes.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Then I repent not.</p>
<p>JEWELLER You know me, Apemantus?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Thou know’st I do: I called thee by thy name 168 .</p>
<p>TIMON Thou art proud 169 , Apemantus!</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.</p>
<p>TIMON Whither art going?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS To knock out an honest Athenian’s brains.</p>
<p>TIMON That’s a deed thou’lt die for.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Right, if doing nothing 170 be death by th’law.</p>
<p>TIMON How lik’st thou this picture, Apemantus?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS The best, for the innocence 171 .</p>
<p>TIMON Wrought 172 he not well that painted it?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS He 173 wrought better that made the painter, and yet he’s
but a filthy piece of work.</p>
<p>PAINTER You’re a dog 174 .</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Thy mother’s of my generation 175 : what’s she, if I be a
dog?</p>
<p>TIMON Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS No, I eat not lords 176 .</p>
<p>TIMON An 177 thou shouldst, thou’dst anger ladies.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS O, they eat 178 lords: so they come by 179 great bellies
180 .</p>
<p>TIMON That’s a lascivious apprehension 181 .</p>
<p>APEMANTUS So thou apprehend’st it, take it for thy labour 182 .</p>
<p>TIMON How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Not so well as plain-dealing 183 , which will not cost a
man a doit 184 185 .</p>
<p>TIMON What dost thou think ’tis worth?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Not worth my thinking.— How now 186 , poet?</p>
<p>POET How now, philosopher?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Thou liest.</p>
<p>POET Art not one?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Yes.</p>
<p>POET Then I lie not.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Art not a poet?</p>
<p>POET Yes.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Then thou liest 187 : look in thy last work, where thou
hast feigned him 188 a worthy fellow.</p>
<p>POET That’s not feigned, he is so.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Yes, he is worthy of 189 thee, and to pay thee for thy
labour. He that loves to be flattered is worthy o’th’flatterer. Heavens,
that I were a lord!</p>
<p>TIMON What wouldst do then, Apemantus?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS E’en 190 as Apemantus does now: hate a lord with my
heart.</p>
<p>TIMON What, thyself?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Ay.</p>
<p>TIMON Wherefore? 191</p>
<p>APEMANTUS That I had no angry wit 192 to be a lord.— Art not thou a
merchant?</p>
<p>MERCHANT Ay, Apemantus.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Traffic 193 confound 194 thee, if the gods will not!</p>
<p>MERCHANT If traffic do it, the gods do it.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Traffic’s thy god, and thy god confound thee!</p>
<p>Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>TIMON What 195 trumpet’s that?</p>
<p>MESSENGER ’Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse 196</p>
<p>All of companionship 197 .</p>
<p>TIMON Pray entertain 198 them, give them guide 199 to us.</p>
<p>[Exeunt some Attendants ]</p>
<p>You must needs dine with me.— Go not you hence</p>
<p>Till I have thanked you.— When dinner’s done,</p>
<p>To Painter</p>
<p>Show me this piece.— I am joyful of your sights 200 .</p>
<p>To all</p>
<p>Enter Alcibiades, with the rest</p>
<p>Most welcome, sir!</p>
<p>APEMANTUS So, so, there! 201</p>
<p>Aches contract and starve 202 your supple joints!</p>
<p>That there should be small 203 love amongst these sweet 204
knaves,</p>
<p>And all this courtesy! The strain 205 of man’s bred out 206</p>
<p>Into baboon and monkey.</p>
<p>ALCIBIADES Sir, you have saved my longing 207 , and I feed</p>
<p>To Timon</p>
<p>Most hungerly 208 on your sight 209 .</p>
<p>TIMON Right welcome, sir!</p>
<p>Ere 210 we depart 211 , we’ll share a bounteous 212 time</p>
<p>In different 213 pleasures. Pray you, let us in 214 .</p>
<p>Exeunt [all except Apemantus ]</p>
<p>Enter two Lords</p>
<p>FIRST LORD What time o’day is’t, Apemantus?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Time to be honest.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD That time serves still 215 .</p>
<p>APEMANTUS The most accursèd thou, that still omitt’st 216 it.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Thou art going to Lord Timon’s feast?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Ay, to see meat 217 fill knaves and wine heat fools.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Fare thee well, fare thee well.</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Why, Apemantus?</p>
<p>APEMANTUS Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to give thee
none.</p>
<p>FIRST LORD Hang thyself!</p>
<p>APEMANTUS No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy requests to
thy friend.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Away, unpeaceable 218 dog, or I’ll spurn 219 thee
hence!</p>
<p>APEMANTUS I will fly 220 , like a dog, the heels o’th’ass 221 .</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>FIRST LORD He’s opposite to 222 humanity. Come, shall we in,</p>
<p>And taste Lord Timon’s bounty? He outgoes 223</p>
<p>The very heart of kindness.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD He pours it out. Plutus 224 , the god of gold,</p>
<p>Is but his steward 225 : no meed 226 , but he repays</p>
<p>Sevenfold above itself: no gift to him</p>
<p>But breeds the giver a return exceeding</p>
<p>All use of quittance 227 .</p>
<p>FIRST LORD The noblest mind he carries</p>
<p>That ever governed man.</p>
<p>SECOND LORD Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?</p>
<p>I’ll keep you company.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
