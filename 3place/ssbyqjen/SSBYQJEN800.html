<h4 id="scene-3-198-running-scene-3">Scene 3 198 / running scene 3</h4>
<p>Enter three or four Petitioners 199 , [Peter ] the armourer’s man 200
being one</p>
<p>FIRST PETITIONER My masters 201 , let’s stand close 202 : my Lord
Protector will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver our
supplications in the quill 203 .</p>
<p>SECOND PETITIONER Marry, the Lord protect 204 him, for he’s a good
man, Jesu bless him.</p>
<p>Enter Suffolk and Queen [Margaret ]</p>
<p>FIRST PETITIONER Here a 205 comes, methinks, and the queen with him.
I’ll be the first, sure.</p>
<p>He goes to meet Suffolk and the Queen</p>
<p>SECOND PETITIONER Come back, fool: this is the Duke of Suffolk, and
not my Lord Protector.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK How now, fellow: wouldst 206 anything with me?</p>
<p>FIRST PETITIONER I pray, my lord, pardon me: I took ye for my Lord
Protector.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET ‘To my Lord Protector!’— Are your supplications to his
lordship?</p>
<p>Reading</p>
<p>Let me see them: what is thine?</p>
<p>FIRST PETITIONER Mine is, an’t 207 please your grace, against John
Goodman, my lord cardinal’s man 208 , for keeping my house and lands and
wife and all from me.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Thy wife too? That’s some wrong indeed.— What’s yours?</p>
<p>To Second Petitioner</p>
<p>What’s here?— ‘Against the Duke of Suffolk, for enclosing the commons
209 of Melford.’— How now, Sir Knave?</p>
<p>Reading supplication</p>
<p>To Second Petitioner</p>
<p>SECOND PETITIONER Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our whole
township.</p>
<p>PETER Against my master, Thomas Horner, for saying that the Duke of
York was rightful heir to the crown.</p>
<p>Offering his petition</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET What say’st thou? Did the Duke of York say he was
rightful heir to the crown?</p>
<p>PETER That my master was? No, forsooth 210 : my master said that he
was, and that the king was an usurper.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Who is there?</p>
<p>Enter Servant</p>
<p>Take this fellow in, and send for his master with a pursuivant 211
presently.— We’ll hear more of your matter before the king.</p>
<p>Exit [Servant with Peter ]</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET And as for you that love to be protected</p>
<p>Under the wings of our Protector’s grace,</p>
<p>Begin your suits anew, and sue to 212 him</p>
<p>Tear the supplication</p>
<p>Away, base cullions 213 !— Suffolk, let them go.</p>
<p>ALL [PETITIONERS ] Come, let’s be gone</p>
<p>Exeunt [Petitioners ]</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET My lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise 214 ?</p>
<p>Is this the fashions 215 in the court of England?</p>
<p>Is this the government of Britain’s isle?</p>
<p>And this the royalty of Albion 216 ’s king?</p>
<p>What, shall King Henry be a pupil still</p>
<p>Under the surly Gloucester’s governance?</p>
<p>Am I a queen in title and in style 217 ,</p>
<p>And must be made a subject to a duke?</p>
<p>I tell thee, Pole 218 , when in the city Tours</p>
<p>Thou ran’st a-tilt 219 in honour of my love</p>
<p>And stol’st away the ladies’ hearts of France,</p>
<p>I thought King Henry had resemblèd thee</p>
<p>In courage, courtship and proportion 220 :</p>
<p>But all his mind is bent 221 to holiness,</p>
<p>To number 222 Ave-Maries 223 on his beads 224 :</p>
<p>His champions 225 are the prophets and apostles,</p>
<p>His weapons holy saws 226 of sacred writ,</p>
<p>His study is his tilt-yard 227 , and his loves</p>
<p>Are brazen images 228 of canonizèd saints.</p>
<p>I would the college of the cardinals 229</p>
<p>Would choose him Pope, and carry him to Rome,</p>
<p>And set the triple crown 230 upon his head:</p>
<p>That were a state 231 fit for his holiness 232 .</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Madam, be patient: as I was cause</p>
<p>Your highness came to England, so will I</p>
<p>In England work 233 your grace’s full content.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Beside the haughty Protector, have we Beaufort</p>
<p>The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,</p>
<p>And grumbling York: and not the least of these</p>
<p>But 234 can do more in England than the king.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK And he of these that can do most of all</p>
<p>Cannot do more in England than the Nevilles:</p>
<p>Salisbury and Warwick are no simple 235 peers.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Not all these lords do vex me half so much</p>
<p>As that proud dame, the Lord Protector’s wife:</p>
<p>She sweeps it 236 through the court with troops of ladies,</p>
<p>More like an empress than Duke Humphrey’s wife:</p>
<p>Strangers 237 in court do take her for the queen:</p>
<p>She bears a duke’s revenues 238 on her back 239 ,</p>
<p>And in her heart she scorns our poverty:</p>
<p>Shall I not live to be avenged on her?</p>
<p>Contemptuous 240 base-born callet 241 as she is,</p>
<p>She vaunted 242 ’mongst her minions 243 t’other day,</p>
<p>The very train of her worst wearing 244 gown</p>
<p>Was better worth 245 than all my father’s lands,</p>
<p>Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter 246 .</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Madam, myself have limed a bush 247 for her,</p>
<p>And placed a choir of such enticing birds 248 ,</p>
<p>That she will light 249 to listen to the lays 250 ,</p>
<p>And never mount to trouble you again.</p>
<p>So let her rest: and, madam, list to me,</p>
<p>For I am bold to counsel you in this:</p>
<p>Although we fancy 251 not the cardinal,</p>
<p>Yet must we join with him and with the lords,</p>
<p>Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.</p>
<p>As for the Duke of York, this late complaint 252</p>
<p>Will make but little for his benefit 253 :</p>
<p>So one by one we’ll weed 254 them all at last,</p>
<p>And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.</p>
<p>Sound a sennet 255 . Enter the King [Henry VI with Somerset and ]
York [whispering on either side of him ], Duke Humphrey [of Gloucester
], Cardinal, Buckingham, Salisbury, Warwick and the Duchess [Eleanor
]</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI For my part, noble lords, I care not which:</p>
<p>Or 256 Somerset or York, all’s one to me.</p>
<p>YORK If York have ill demeaned 257 himself in France,</p>
<p>Then let him be denied the regentship 258 .</p>
<p>SOMERSET If Somerset be unworthy of the place,</p>
<p>Let York be regent: I will yield to him.</p>
<p>WARWICK Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no,</p>
<p>Dispute not that: York is the worthier.</p>
<p>CARDINAL Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.</p>
<p>WARWICK The cardinal’s not my better in the field 259 .</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM All in this presence 260 are thy betters, Warwick.</p>
<p>WARWICK Warwick may live to be the best of all.</p>
<p>SALISBURY Peace, son, and show some reason, Buckingham,</p>
<p>Why Somerset should be preferred in this.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Because the king, forsooth, will have it so.</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Madam, the king is old enough himself</p>
<p>To give his censure 261 : these are no women’s matters.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET If he be old enough, what needs your grace</p>
<p>To be Protector of his excellence?</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Madam, I am Protector of the realm,</p>
<p>And at his pleasure will resign my place.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Resign it then and leave 262 thine insolence.</p>
<p>Since thou wert king — as who is king but thou? —</p>
<p>The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack,</p>
<p>The dauphin 263 hath prevailed 264 beyond the seas,</p>
<p>And all the peers and nobles of the realm</p>
<p>Have been as bondmen 265 to thy sovereignty.</p>
<p>CARDINAL The commons hast thou racked 266 : the clergy’s bags 267</p>
<p>Are lank 268 and lean with thy extortions.</p>
<p>SOMERSET Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife’s attire</p>
<p>Have cost a mass of public treasury 269 .</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Thy cruelty in execution</p>
<p>Upon offenders hath exceeded law,</p>
<p>And left thee to the mercy of the law.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Thy sale of offices 270 and towns in France,</p>
<p>If they were known, as the suspect 271 is great,</p>
<p>Would make thee quickly hop without thy head 272 .</p>
<p>Exit Gloucester</p>
<p>Queen Margaret drops her fan</p>
<p>Give me my fan: what, minion 273 , can ye not?</p>
<p>To Eleanor</p>
<p>She gives the Duchess [Eleanor ] a box on the ear</p>
<p>I cry you mercy 274 , madam: was it you?</p>
<p>ELEANOR Was’t I? Yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman:</p>
<p>Could I come near your beauty with my nails,</p>
<p>I’d set my ten commandments 275 in your face.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Sweet aunt, be quiet: ’twas against her will 276 .</p>
<p>ELEANOR Against her will, good king? Look to’t 277 in time,</p>
<p>She’ll hamper 278 thee and dandle 279 thee like a baby:</p>
<p>Though in this place most master 280 wear no breeches,</p>
<p>She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged.</p>
<p>Exit Eleanor</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Lord Cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,</p>
<p>And listen after 281 Humphrey, how he proceeds:</p>
<p>She’s tickled 282 now, her fury needs no spurs,</p>
<p>She’ll gallop far enough to her destruction.</p>
<p>Exit Buckingham</p>
<p>Enter Humphrey [Duke of Gloucester ]</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Now, lords, my choler being overblown</p>
<p>With walking once about the quadrangle,</p>
<p>I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.</p>
<p>As for your spiteful false objections 283 ,</p>
<p>Prove them, and I lie open to the law:</p>
<p>But God in mercy so deal with my soul,</p>
<p>As I in duty love my king and country.</p>
<p>But to the matter that we have in hand:—</p>
<p>I say, my sovereign, York is meetest 284 man</p>
<p>To be your regent in the realm of France.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Before we make election 285 , give me leave 286</p>
<p>To show some reason, of no little force,</p>
<p>That York is most unmeet of any man.</p>
<p>YORK I’ll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:</p>
<p>First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride 287 :</p>
<p>Next, if I be appointed for the place,</p>
<p>My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,</p>
<p>Without discharge 288 , money, or furniture 289 ,</p>
<p>Till France be won into the dauphin’s hands:</p>
<p>Last time I danced attendance on his will</p>
<p>Till Paris was besieged, famished, and lost.</p>
<p>WARWICK That can I witness, and a fouler fact 290</p>
<p>Did never traitor in the land commit.</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Peace, headstrong Warwick.</p>
<p>WARWICK Image 291 of pride, why should I hold my peace?</p>
<p>Enter [guarded, Horner the ] armourer and his man [Peter ]</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Because here is a man accused of treason:</p>
<p>Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!</p>
<p>YORK Doth anyone accuse York for 292 a traitor?</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI What mean’st thou, Suffolk? Tell me, what 293 are
these?</p>
<p>SUFFOLK Please it your majesty, this is the man</p>
<p>Indicating Peter</p>
<p>That doth accuse his master of high treason:</p>
<p>His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,</p>
<p>Was rightful heir unto the English crown</p>
<p>And that your majesty was an usurper.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Say, man, were these thy words?</p>
<p>HORNER An’t 294 shall please your majesty, I never said nor thought
any such matter:</p>
<p>God is my witness, I am falsely accused by the villain.</p>
<p>PETER By these ten bones 295 , my lords, he did speak them to me in
the garret 296 one night, as we were scouring 297 my Lord of York’s
armour.</p>
<p>Raising his hands</p>
<p>YORK Base dunghill villain and mechanical 298 ,</p>
<p>I’ll have thy head for this thy traitor’s speech.—</p>
<p>I do beseech your royal majesty,</p>
<p>Let him have all the rigour of the law.</p>
<p>HORNER Alas, my lord, hang me if ever I spake the words: my accuser
is my prentice 299 , and when I did correct 300 him for his fault the
other day, he did vow upon his knees he would be even with me — I have
good witness of this — therefore I beseech your majesty, do not cast
away an honest man for a villain’s accusation.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?</p>
<p>To Gloucester</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER This doom 301 , my lord, if I may judge:</p>
<p>Let Somerset be regent o’er the French,</p>
<p>Because in York this 302 breeds suspicion:</p>
<p>And let these have a day appointed them</p>
<p>Indicating Horner and Peter</p>
<p>For single combat in convenient 303 place,</p>
<p>For he hath witness of his servant’s malice:</p>
<p>Indicating Horner</p>
<p>This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey’s doom.</p>
<p>SOMERSET I humbly thank your royal majesty.</p>
<p>HORNER And I accept the combat willingly.</p>
<p>PETER Alas, my lord, I cannot fight: for God’s sake, pity my case:
the spite of man prevaileth against me. O Lord, have mercy upon me! I
shall never be able to fight a blow. O Lord, my heart!</p>
<p>GLOUCESTER Sirrah 304 , or 305 you must fight, or else be hanged.</p>
<p>KING HENRY VI Away with them to prison, and the day</p>
<p>Of combat shall be the last of the next month.</p>
<p>Come, Somerset, we’ll see thee sent away</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt</p>
