13</h4>
<p>Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Douglas and Vernon</p>
<p>HOTSPUR We’ll fight with him 1523 tonight.</p>
<p>WORCESTER It may not be.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS You give him then 1524 advantage.</p>
<p>VERNON Not a whit.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Why say you so? Looks he not for supply? 1525</p>
<p>VERNON So do we.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR His is certain, ours is doubtful.</p>
<p>WORCESTER Good cousin, be advised, stir not tonight.</p>
<p>VERNON Do not, my lord.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS You do not counsel well:</p>
<p>You speak it out of fear and cold heart.</p>
<p>VERNON Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,</p>
<p>And I dare well maintain 1526 it with my life,</p>
<p>If well-respected 1527 honour bid me on 1528 ,</p>
<p>I hold as little counsel 1529 with weak fear</p>
<p>As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives.</p>
<p>Let it be seen tomorrow in the battle</p>
<p>Which of us fears.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS Yea, or tonight.</p>
<p>VERNON Content.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Tonight, say I.</p>
<p>VERNON Come, come it may not be. I wonder much,</p>
<p>Being men of such great leading 1530 as you are,</p>
<p>That you foresee not what impediments</p>
<p>Drag 1531 back our expedition 1532 : certain horse 1533</p>
<p>Of my cousin Vernon’s are not yet come up,</p>
<p>Your uncle Worcester’s horse came but today,</p>
<p>And now their pride and mettle 1534 is asleep,</p>
<p>Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,</p>
<p>That not a horse is half the half of himself 1535 .</p>
<p>HOTSPUR So are the horses of the enemy</p>
<p>In general, journey-bated 1536 and brought low.</p>
<p>The better part of ours are full of rest.</p>
<p>WORCESTER The number of the king exceedeth ours:</p>
<p>For God’s sake, cousin, stay till all come in.</p>
<p>The trumpet sounds a parley 1537</p>
<p>Enter Sir Walter Blunt</p>
<p>BLUNT I come with gracious offers from the king,</p>
<p>If you vouchsafe 1538 me hearing and respect 1539 .</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt, and would to God</p>
<p>You were of our determination 1540 .</p>
<p>Some of us love you well, and even those some 1541</p>
<p>Envy your great deservings and good name,</p>
<p>Because you are not of our quality 1542 ,</p>
<p>But stand against us like an enemy.</p>
<p>BLUNT And heaven defend 1543 but still I should stand so,</p>
<p>So long as out of limit 1544 and true rule</p>
<p>You stand against anointed 1545 majesty.</p>
<p>But to my charge 1546 : the king hath sent to know</p>
<p>The nature of your griefs 1547 , and whereupon 1548</p>
<p>You conjure 1549 from the breast of civil peace</p>
<p>Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land</p>
<p>Audacious cruelty. If that 1550 the king</p>
<p>Have any way your good deserts 1551 forgot,</p>
<p>Which he confesseth to be manifold,</p>
<p>He bids you name your griefs, and with all speed</p>
<p>You shall have your desires with interest 1552 ,</p>
<p>And pardon absolute for yourself and these</p>
<p>Herein misled by your suggestion 1553 .</p>
<p>HOTSPUR The king is kind, and well we know the king</p>
<p>Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.</p>
<p>My father, my uncle and myself</p>
<p>Did give him that same royalty he wears,</p>
<p>And when he was not six and twenty strong 1554 ,</p>
<p>Sick in the world’s regard 1555 , wretched and low,</p>
<p>A poor unminded 1556 outlaw 1557 sneaking home,</p>
<p>My father gave him welcome to the shore.</p>
<p>And when he heard him swear and vow to God</p>
<p>He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,</p>
<p>To sue his livery 1558 and beg his peace 1559 ,</p>
<p>With tears of innocency and terms of zeal 1560 ,</p>
<p>My father, in kind heart and pity moved,</p>
<p>Swore him assistance and performed it too.</p>
<p>Now when the lords and barons of the realm</p>
<p>Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,</p>
<p>The more and less came in with cap and knee 1561 ,</p>
<p>Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,</p>
<p>Attended 1562 him on bridges, stood in lanes 1563 ,</p>
<p>Laid gifts before him, proffered him their oaths,</p>
<p>Gave him their heirs, as pages followed 1564 him</p>
<p>Even at the heels in golden 1565 multitudes.</p>
<p>He presently 1566 , as greatness knows itself 1567 ,</p>
<p>Steps me a little higher 1568 than his vow</p>
<p>Made to my father, while his blood was poor 1569 ,</p>
<p>Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh,</p>
<p>And now, forsooth 1570 , takes on him to reform</p>
<p>Some certain edicts and some strait 1571 decrees</p>
<p>That lay too heavy on the commonwealth,</p>
<p>Cries out upon abuses 1572 , seems to weep</p>
<p>Over his country’s wrongs, and by this face,</p>
<p>This seeming brow of justice, did he win</p>
<p>The hearts of all that he did angle for.</p>
<p>Proceeded further — cut me 1573 off the heads</p>
<p>Of all the favourites 1574 that the absent king</p>
<p>In deputation 1575 left behind him here,</p>
<p>When he was personal in 1576 the Irish war.</p>
<p>BLUNT Tut, I came not to hear this.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Then to the point.</p>
<p>In short time after, he deposed the king.</p>
<p>Soon after that, deprived him of his life,</p>
<p>And in the neck of 1577 that, tasked 1578 the whole state.</p>
<p>To make that worse, suffered his kinsman March 1579 —</p>
<p>Who is, if every owner were placed 1580 ,</p>
<p>Indeed his king — to be engaged 1581 in Wales,</p>
<p>There without ransom to lie forfeited 1582 ,</p>
<p>Disgraced me in my happy victories 1583 ,</p>
<p>Sought to entrap me by intelligence 1584 ,</p>
<p>Rated 1585 my uncle from the council board,</p>
<p>In rage dismissed my father from the court,</p>
<p>Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,</p>
<p>And in conclusion drove us to seek out</p>
<p>This head of safety 1586 ; and withal 1587 to pry</p>
<p>Into his title 1588 , the which we find</p>
<p>Too indirect 1589 for long continuance 1590 .</p>
<p>BLUNT Shall I return this answer to the king?</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Not so, Sir Walter. We’ll withdraw awhile.</p>
<p>Go to the king, and let there be impawned 1591</p>
<p>Some surety 1592 for a safe return again,</p>
<p>And in the morning early shall my uncle</p>
<p>Bring him our purpose. And so farewell.</p>
<p>BLUNT I would you would accept of grace and love 1593 .</p>
<p>HOTSPUR And’t may be so we shall.</p>
<p>BLUNT Pray heaven you do.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
