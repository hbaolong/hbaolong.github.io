13</h4>
<p>Enter [George ] Bevis and John Holland 1166 [with long staves 1167
]</p>
<p>BEVIS Come and get thee a sword, though made of a lath 1168 : they
have been up 1169 these two days.</p>
<p>HOLLAND They have the more need to sleep now then.</p>
<p>BEVIS I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier 1170 means to dress 1171
the commonwealth, and turn it 1172 , and set a new nap 1173 upon it 1174
.</p>
<p>HOLLAND So he had need, for ’tis threadbare. Well, I say it was never
merry world 1175 in England since gentlemen came up 1176 .</p>
<p>BEVIS O miserable age: virtue is not regarded 1177 in
handicraftsmen.</p>
<p>HOLLAND The nobility think scorn 1178 to go in leather aprons 1179
.</p>
<p>BEVIS Nay more, the King’s Council are no good workmen.</p>
<p>HOLLAND True: and yet it is said, ‘Labour in thy vocation’ 1180 :
which is as much to say as, ‘Let the magistrates be labouring 1181 men’,
and therefore should we be magistrates.</p>
<p>BEVIS Thou hast hit it 1182 : for there’s no better sign of a brave
1183 mind than a hard 1184 hand.</p>
<p>HOLLAND I see them! I see them! There’s Best’s son, the tanner 1185
of Wingham 1186 .</p>
<p>BEVIS He shall have the skins of our enemies to make dog’s leather
1187 of.</p>
<p>HOLLAND And Dick the Butcher.</p>
<p>BEVIS Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity’s throat cut
like a calf.</p>
<p>HOLLAND And Smith the weaver.</p>
<p>BEVIS Argo 1188 , their thread of life is spun 1189 .</p>
<p>HOLLAND Come, come, let’s fall in 1190 with them.</p>
<p>Drum. Enter Cade, Dick [the ] Butcher, Smith the Weaver, and a Sawyer
1191 , with infinite numbers 1192 [with long staves ]</p>
<p>CADE We 1193 , John Cade, so termed of 1194 our supposed father—</p>
<p>DICK Or rather of 1195 stealing a cade 1196 of herrings.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CADE For our enemies shall fail 1197 before us, inspired with the
spirit of putting down kings and princes.— Command silence.</p>
<p>DICK Silence!</p>
<p>CADE My father was a Mortimer—</p>
<p>DICK He was an honest man, and a good bricklayer 1198 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CADE My mother a Plantagenet—</p>
<p>DICK I knew her well, she was a midwife.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CADE My wife descended of the Lacys 1199 —</p>
<p>DICK She was indeed a pedlar’s daughter, and sold many laces 1200
.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>SMITH But now of late, not able to travel 1201 with her furred pack
1202 , she washes bucks 1203 here at home.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CADE Therefore am I of an honourable house.</p>
<p>DICK Ay, by my faith, the field 1204 is honourable, and there was he
born, under a hedge 1205 : for his father had never a house but the cage
1206 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CADE Valiant I am—</p>
<p>SMITH A must needs 1207 , for beggary is valiant 1208 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CADE I am able to endure much—</p>
<p>DICK No question of that: for I have seen him whipped 1209 three
market days together.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CADE I fear neither sword nor fire—</p>
<p>SMITH He need not fear the sword, for his coat is of proof 1210 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>DICK But methinks he should stand 1211 in fear of fire, being burnt
1212 i’th’hand for stealing of sheep.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>CADE Be brave, then, for your captain is brave, and vows reformation.
There shall be in England seven halfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the
three-hooped pot shall have ten hoops 1213 , and I will make it felony
to drink small 1214 beer. All the realm shall be in common 1215 , and in
Cheapside 1216 shall my palfrey 1217 go to grass 1218 : and when I am
king, as king I will be—</p>
<p>ALL God save your majesty!</p>
<p>CADE I thank you, good people. There shall be no money: all shall eat
and drink on my score 1219 , and I will apparel 1220 them all in one
livery 1221 , that they may agree 1222 like brothers, and worship me
their lord.</p>
<p>DICK The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.</p>
<p>CADE Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable thing, that of
the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? That parchment,
being scribbled o’er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings, but I
say, ’tis the bee’s wax 1223 : for I did but seal 1224 once to a thing
1225 , and I was never mine own man since. How now? Who’s there?</p>
<p>Enter [some, bringing forward ] a Clerk 1226 [of Chartham 1227 ]</p>
<p>SMITH The Clerk of Chartham: he can write and read and cast account
1228 .</p>
<p>CADE O, monstrous 1229 .</p>
<p>SMITH We took 1230 him setting of boys’ copies 1231 .</p>
<p>CADE Here’s a villain!</p>
<p>SMITH H’as a book in his pocket with red letters 1232 in’t.</p>
<p>CADE Nay, then he is a conjurer 1233 .</p>
<p>DICK Nay, he can make obligations 1234 , and write court hand 1235
.</p>
<p>CADE I am sorry for’t: the man is a proper 1236 man, of mine honour:
unless I find him guilty, he shall not die. Come hither, sirrah, I must
examine thee: what is thy name?</p>
<p>CLERK Emmanuel 1237 .</p>
<p>DICK They use to write it on the top of letters: ’twill go hard with
1238 you.</p>
<p>CADE Let me alone.— Dost thou use to 1239 write thy name? Or hast
thou a mark to thyself 1240 , like an honest plain-dealing 1241 man?</p>
<p>To the Clerk</p>
<p>CLERK Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought up that I can
write my name.</p>
<p>ALL He hath confessed: away with him: he’s a villain and a
traitor.</p>
<p>CADE Away with him, I say: hang him with his pen and inkhorn 1242
about his neck.</p>
<p>Exit one with the Clerk</p>
<p>Enter Michael</p>
<p>MICHAEL Where’s our general?</p>
<p>CADE Here I am, thou particular 1243 fellow.</p>
<p>MICHAEL Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother are hard
1244 by, with the king’s forces.</p>
<p>CADE Stand, villain, stand, or I’ll fell thee down: he shall be
encountered 1245 with a man as good as himself. He is but a 1246 knight,
is a?</p>
<p>MICHAEL No 1247 .</p>
<p>CADE To equal him I will make myself a knight presently 1248 .</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>Rise up Sir John Mortimer.</p>
<p>Rises</p>
<p>Now have at him!</p>
<p>Enter Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother, with Drum 1249 , [Herald
] and Soldiers</p>
<p>STAFFORD Rebellious hinds 1250 , the filth and scum of Kent,</p>
<p>Marked for the gallows: lay your weapons down:</p>
<p>Home to your cottages: forsake this groom 1251 .</p>
<p>The king is merciful, if you revolt 1252 .</p>
<p>STAFFORD’S BROTHER But angry, wrathful, and inclined to blood,</p>
<p>If you go forward: therefore yield, or die.</p>
<p>CADE As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass 1253 not:</p>
<p>It is to you, good people, that I speak,</p>
<p>Over whom, in time to come, I hope to reign:</p>
<p>For I am rightful heir unto the crown.</p>
<p>STAFFORD Villain, thy father was a plasterer,</p>
<p>And thou thyself a shearman 1254 , art thou not?</p>
<p>CADE And Adam 1255 was a gardener.</p>
<p>STAFFORD’S BROTHER And what of that?</p>
<p>CADE Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, married the Duke of
Clarence’ daughter, did he not?</p>
<p>STAFFORD Ay, sir.</p>
<p>CADE By her he had two children at one birth 1256 .</p>
<p>STAFFORD’S BROTHER That’s false.</p>
<p>CADE Ay, there’s the question 1257 : but I say ’tis true:</p>
<p>The elder of them, being put to nurse 1258 ,</p>
<p>Was by a beggar-woman stol’n away,</p>
<p>And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,</p>
<p>Became a bricklayer when he came to age.</p>
<p>His son am I: deny it if you can.</p>
<p>DICK Nay, ’tis too true: therefore he shall be king.</p>
<p>SMITH Sir, he made a chimney in my father’s house, and the bricks are
alive 1259 at this day to testify it: therefore deny it not.</p>
<p>STAFFORD And will you credit this base drudge’s words,</p>
<p>That speaks he knows not what?</p>
<p>ALL Ay, marry, will we: therefore get ye gone.</p>
<p>STAFFORD’S BROTHER Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you
this.</p>
<p>CADE He lies, for I invented it myself.—</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Go to 1260 , sirrah, tell the king from me, that for his father’s
sake, Henry the Fifth, i whose time boys went to span-counter 1261 for
French crowns 1262 , I am content he shall reign: but I’ll be Protector
1263 over him.</p>
<p>Aloud</p>
<p>DICK And furthermore, we’ll have the lord Saye’s head for selling the
dukedom of Maine.</p>
<p>CADE And good reason: for thereby is England mained 1264 , and fain
to go 1265 with a staff, but that my puissance 1266 holds it up. Fellow
kings, I tell you that that Lord Saye hath gelded 1267 the commonwealth,
and made it an eunuch: and more than that, he can speak French, and
therefore he is a traitor.</p>
<p>STAFFORD O gross and miserable 1268 ignorance!</p>
<p>CADE Nay, answer if you can: the Frenchmen are our enemies: go to,
then, I ask but this: can he that speaks with the tongue 1269 of an
enemy be a good counsellor, or no?</p>
<p>ALL No, no, and therefore we’ll have his head.</p>
<p>STAFFORD’S BROTHER Well, seeing gentle 1270 words will not
prevail,</p>
<p>Assail them with the army of the king.</p>
<p>STAFFORD Herald, away, and throughout every town</p>
<p>Proclaim them traitors that are up 1271 with Cade,</p>
<p>That 1272 those which fly before the battle ends</p>
<p>May, even in their wives’ and children’s sight,</p>
<p>Be hanged up for 1273 example at their doors:</p>
<p>And you that be the king’s friends, follow me.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Stafford, Stafford’s brother and Soldiers ]</p>
<p>CADE And you that love the commons, follow me:</p>
<p>Now show yourselves men, ’tis for liberty.</p>
<p>We will not leave one lord, one gentleman:</p>
<p>Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon 1274 ,</p>
<p>For they are thrifty 1275 honest men, and such</p>
<p>As would, but that they dare not, take our parts.</p>
<p>DICK They are all in order 1276 and march toward us.</p>
<p>CADE But then are we in order when we are most out of order 1277 .
Come, march forward.</p>
<p>[Exeunt ]</p>
