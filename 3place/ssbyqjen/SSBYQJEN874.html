13</h4>
<p>Enter Richard and Buckingham, at several 1078 doors</p>
<p>RICHARD How now, how now? What say the citizens?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Now, by the holy mother of our lord,</p>
<p>The citizens are mum 1079 , say not a word.</p>
<p>RICHARD Touched you 1080 the bastardy of Edward’s children?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM I did: with his contract 1081 with Lady Lucy,</p>
<p>And his contract by deputy in France 1082 ,</p>
<p>Th’unsatiate greediness of his desire,</p>
<p>And his enforcement 1083 of the city wives,</p>
<p>His tyranny for trifles 1084 , his own bastardy,</p>
<p>As being got 1085 , your father then in France,</p>
<p>And his resemblance, being not like the duke.</p>
<p>Withal I did infer your lineaments,</p>
<p>Being the right idea of your father,</p>
<p>Both in your form and nobleness of mind:</p>
<p>Laid open 1086 all your victories in Scotland,</p>
<p>Your discipline 1087 in war, wisdom in peace,</p>
<p>Your bounty 1088 , virtue, fair 1089 humility:</p>
<p>Indeed, left nothing fitting for 1090 your purpose</p>
<p>Untouched, or slightly 1091 handled, in discourse.</p>
<p>And when my oratory drew toward end,</p>
<p>I bid them that did love their country’s good</p>
<p>Cry ‘God save Richard, England’s royal king!’</p>
<p>RICHARD And did they so?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM No, so God help me, they spake not a word,</p>
<p>But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,</p>
<p>Stared each on other and looked deadly pale:</p>
<p>Which when I saw, I reprehended them,</p>
<p>And asked the mayor what meant this wilful silence:</p>
<p>His answer was, the people were not used</p>
<p>To be spoke to but by the recorder 1092 .</p>
<p>Then he was urged to tell my tale again:</p>
<p>‘Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferred 1093’ —</p>
<p>But nothing spoke in warrant from himself 1094 .</p>
<p>When he had done, some followers of mine own,</p>
<p>At lower end of the hall 1095 , hurled up their caps,</p>
<p>And some ten voices cried, ‘God save King Richard!’</p>
<p>And thus I took the vantage 1096 of those few:</p>
<p>‘Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,’ quoth I,</p>
<p>’This general 1097 applause and cheerful shout</p>
<p>Argues 1098 your wisdom and your love to Richard.’</p>
<p>And even here 1099 brake 1100 off, and came away.</p>
<p>RICHARD What tongueless blocks 1101 were they? Would they not
speak?</p>
<p>Will not the mayor then and his brethren 1102 come?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM The mayor is here at hand. Intend 1103 some fear 1104
:</p>
<p>Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit 1105 .</p>
<p>And look 1106 you get a prayer-book in your hand,</p>
<p>And stand between two churchmen, good my lord,</p>
<p>For on that ground 1107 I’ll make a holy descant 1108 :</p>
<p>And be not easily won 1109 to our requests.</p>
<p>Play the maid’s 1110 part: still 1111 answer nay, and take it 1112
.</p>
<p>RICHARD I go. And if you plead as well for them</p>
<p>As I can say nay to thee for myself 1113 ,</p>
<p>No doubt we bring it to a happy issue 1114 .</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Go, go, up to the leads 1115 . The Lord Mayor knocks.</p>
<p>[Exit Richard ]</p>
<p>Enter the Mayor and Citizens</p>
<p>Welcome, my lord. I dance attendance 1116 here:</p>
<p>I think the duke will not be spoke withal.</p>
<p>Enter Catesby</p>
<p>Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request.</p>
<p>CATESBY He doth entreat your grace, my noble lord,</p>
<p>To visit him tomorrow or next day:</p>
<p>He is within, with two right reverend fathers,</p>
<p>Divinely bent 1117 to meditation,</p>
<p>And in no worldly suits 1118 would he be moved,</p>
<p>To draw him from his holy exercise 1119 .</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Return, good Catesby, to the gracious duke:</p>
<p>Tell him myself, the Mayor and Alderman,</p>
<p>In deep 1120 designs, in matter of great moment 1121 ,</p>
<p>No less importing 1122 than our general good,</p>
<p>Are come to have some conference with his grace.</p>
<p>CATESBY I’ll signify so much unto him straight.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!</p>
<p>He is not lulling 1123 on a lewd love-bed,</p>
<p>But on his knees at meditation:</p>
<p>Not dallying 1124 with a brace 1125 of courtesans,</p>
<p>But meditating with two deep 1126 divines 1127 :</p>
<p>Not sleeping, to engross 1128 his idle body,</p>
<p>But praying, to enrich his watchful 1129 soul.</p>
<p>Happy 1130 were England, would this virtuous prince</p>
<p>Take on his grace 1131 the sovereignty thereof:</p>
<p>But sure I fear we shall not win him to it.</p>
<p>MAYOR Marry, God defend 1132 his grace should say us nay!</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM I fear he will. — Here Catesby comes again.</p>
<p>Enter Catesby</p>
<p>Now, Catesby, what says his grace?</p>
<p>CATESBY He wonders to what end you have assembled</p>
<p>Such troops of citizens to come to him,</p>
<p>His grace not being warned thereof before.</p>
<p>He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Sorry I am my noble cousin should</p>
<p>Suspect me that I mean no good to him.</p>
<p>By heaven, we come to him in perfect 1133 love,</p>
<p>And so once more return and tell his grace.</p>
<p>Exit [Catesby ]</p>
<p>When holy and devout religious men</p>
<p>Are at their beads 1134 , ’tis hard to draw them thence,</p>
<p>So sweet is zealous 1135 contemplation.</p>
<p>Enter Richard aloft 1136 , between two Bishops. [Catesby returns
]</p>
<p>MAYOR See, where his grace stands ’tween two clergymen.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Two props 1137 of virtue for a Christian prince,</p>
<p>To stay 1138 him from the fall of 1139 vanity:</p>
<p>And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,</p>
<p>True ornaments to know a holy man.—</p>
<p>Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,</p>
<p>Lend favourable ear to our requests,</p>
<p>And pardon us the interruption</p>
<p>Of thy devotion and right 1140 Christian zeal.</p>
<p>RICHARD My lord, there needs no such apology:</p>
<p>I do beseech your grace to pardon me,</p>
<p>Who, earnest in the service of my God,</p>
<p>Deferred the visitation 1141 of my friends.</p>
<p>But, leaving this, what is your grace’s pleasure?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,</p>
<p>And all good men of this ungoverned isle.</p>
<p>RICHARD I do suspect I have done some offence</p>
<p>That seems disgracious 1142 in the city’s eye,</p>
<p>And that you come to reprehend my ignorance 1143 .</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,</p>
<p>On our entreaties, to amend your fault.</p>
<p>RICHARD Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land 1144 ?</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Know then, it is your fault that you resign</p>
<p>The supreme seat, the throne majestical,</p>
<p>The sceptred 1145 office of your ancestors,</p>
<p>Your state 1146 of fortune 1147 and your due of birth,</p>
<p>The lineal 1148 glory of your royal house,</p>
<p>To the corruption of a blemished 1149 stock 1150 ;</p>
<p>Whiles, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,</p>
<p>Which here we waken to our country’s good,</p>
<p>The noble isle doth want 1151 his proper 1152 limbs:</p>
<p>His face defaced with scars of infamy 1153 ,</p>
<p>His royal stock graft 1154 with ignoble plants 1155 ,</p>
<p>And almost shouldered 1156 in the swallowing gulf 1157</p>
<p>Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.</p>
<p>Which to recure 1158 , we heartily solicit</p>
<p>Your gracious self to take on you the charge</p>
<p>And kingly government of this your land —</p>
<p>Not as Protector, steward, substitute,</p>
<p>Or lowly factor 1159 for another’s gain;</p>
<p>But as successively 1160 from blood to blood,</p>
<p>Your right of birth, your empery 1161 , your own.</p>
<p>For this, consorted 1162 with the citizens,</p>
<p>Your very worshipful 1163 and loving friends,</p>
<p>And by their vehement instigation,</p>
<p>In this just cause come I to move 1164 your grace.</p>
<p>RICHARD I cannot tell if to depart in silence,</p>
<p>Or bitterly to speak in your reproof</p>
<p>Best fitteth my degree 1165 or your condition 1166 .</p>
<p>If not to 1167 answer, you might haply 1168 think</p>
<p>Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded 1169</p>
<p>To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,</p>
<p>Which fondly 1170 you would here impose on me.</p>
<p>If to reprove you for this suit of yours,</p>
<p>So seasoned with your faithful love to me,</p>
<p>Then on the other side I checked 1171 my friends.</p>
<p>Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,</p>
<p>And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,</p>
<p>Definitively thus I answer you:</p>
<p>Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert</p>
<p>Unmeritable 1172 shuns your high request.</p>
<p>First, if all obstacles were cut away 1173 ,</p>
<p>And that my path were even 1174 to the crown,</p>
<p>As the ripe revenue 1175 and due of birth,</p>
<p>Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,</p>
<p>So mighty and so many my defects,</p>
<p>That I would rather hide me from my greatness 1176 —</p>
<p>Being a bark 1177 to brook 1178 no mighty sea —</p>
<p>Than in my greatness covet to be hid 1179 ,</p>
<p>And in the vapour 1180 of my glory smothered.</p>
<p>But, God be thanked, there is no need of me,</p>
<p>And much I need 1181 to help you, were there need.</p>
<p>The royal tree 1182 hath left us royal fruit,</p>
<p>Which, mellowed 1183 by the stealing 1184 hours of time,</p>
<p>Will well become 1185 the seat 1186 of majesty,</p>
<p>And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.</p>
<p>On him I lay that 1187 you would lay on me,</p>
<p>The right and fortune of his happy 1188 stars,</p>
<p>Which God defend 1189 that I should wring 1190 from him!</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM My lord, this argues 1191 conscience in your grace,</p>
<p>But the respects thereof 1192 are nice 1193 and trivial,</p>
<p>All circumstances well considerèd.</p>
<p>You say that Edward is your brother’s son:</p>
<p>So say we too, but not by Edward’s wife,</p>
<p>For first was he contract to Lady Lucy —</p>
<p>Your mother lives a witness to his vow 1194 —</p>
<p>And afterward by substitute 1195 betrothed</p>
<p>To Bona, sister 1196 to the King of France.</p>
<p>These both put off, a poor petitioner 1197 ,</p>
<p>A care-crazed 1198 mother to a many sons,</p>
<p>A beauty-waning and distressèd widow,</p>
<p>Even in the afternoon of her best days,</p>
<p>Made prize and purchase 1199 of his wanton 1200 eye,</p>
<p>Seduced the pitch 1201 and height of his degree</p>
<p>To base declension 1202 and loathed bigamy 1203 .</p>
<p>By her, in his unlawful bed, he got</p>
<p>This Edward, whom our manners 1204 call the prince.</p>
<p>More bitterly could I expostulate 1205 ,</p>
<p>Save that, for reverence to some alive 1206 ,</p>
<p>I give a sparing 1207 limit to my tongue.</p>
<p>Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</p>
<p>This proffered benefit 1208 of dignity 1209 :</p>
<p>If not to bless us and the land withal,</p>
<p>Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry</p>
<p>From the corruption of abusing times,</p>
<p>Unto a lineal true-derivèd 1210 course.</p>
<p>MAYOR Do, good my lord: your citizens entreat you.</p>
<p>To Richard</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffered love.</p>
<p>CATESBY O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!</p>
<p>RICHARD Alas, why would you heap this care 1211 on me?</p>
<p>I am unfit for state and majesty.</p>
<p>I do beseech you, take it not amiss:</p>
<p>I cannot nor I will not yield to you.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM If you refuse it — as 1212 , in love and zeal 1213 ,</p>
<p>Loath to depose the child, your brother’s son,</p>
<p>As well we know your tenderness of heart</p>
<p>And gentle, kind, effeminate 1214 remorse,</p>
<p>Which we have noted in you to your kindred</p>
<p>And equally indeed to all estates 1215 —</p>
<p>Yet know, whe’er you accept our suit or no,</p>
<p>Your brother’s son shall never reign our king,</p>
<p>But we will plant some other in the throne</p>
<p>To the disgrace and downfall of your house:</p>
<p>And in this resolution here we leave you.—</p>
<p>Come, citizens, we will entreat no more.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Buckingham with Citizens ]</p>
<p>CATESBY Call him again, sweet prince. Accept their suit.</p>
<p>If you deny them all the land will rue it.</p>
<p>RICHARD Will you enforce me to a world of cares?</p>
<p>Call them again. I am not made of stones,</p>
<p>But penetrable to your kind entreaties,</p>
<p>Albeit against my conscience and my soul.</p>
<p>Enter Buckingham and the rest</p>
<p>Cousin of Buckingham, and sage, grave men,</p>
<p>Since you will buckle 1216 fortune on my back,</p>
<p>To bear her burden, whe’er I will or no,</p>
<p>I must have patience to endure the load:</p>
<p>But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach</p>
<p>Attend the sequel 1217 of your imposition,</p>
<p>Your mere 1218 enforcement shall acquittance me 1219</p>
<p>From all the impure blots and stains thereof;</p>
<p>For God doth know, and you may partly see,</p>
<p>How far I am from the desire of this.</p>
<p>MAYOR God bless your grace! We see it and will say it.</p>
<p>RICHARD In saying so, you shall but say the truth.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Then I salute you with this royal title:</p>
<p>Long live King Richard, England’s worthy king!</p>
<p>ALL Amen.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Tomorrow may it please you to be crowned?</p>
<p>RICHARD Even 1220 when you please, for you will have it so.</p>
<p>BUCKINGHAM Tomorrow, then, we will attend your grace.</p>
<p>And so most joyfully we take our leave.</p>
<p>RICHARD Come, let us to our holy work again.—</p>
<p>To the Bishops</p>
<p>Farewell, my cousins: farewell, gentle friends.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 4</p>
