<h4 id="scene-1-915-running-scene-8">Scene 1 915 / running scene 8</h4>
<p>Cornets. Enter Coriolanus, Menenius, all the gentry, Cominius, Titus
Lartius, and other Senators</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Tullus Aufidius then had made new head 916 ?</p>
<p>LARTIUS He had, my lord, and that it was which caused</p>
<p>Our swifter composition 917 .</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS So then the Volsces stand but as at first, 5</p>
<p>Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road 918</p>
<p>Upon’s again.</p>
<p>COMINIUS They are worn 919 , lord consul, so,</p>
<p>That we shall hardly in our ages 920 see</p>
<p>Their banners wave again.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Saw you Aufidius?</p>
<p>To Lartius</p>
<p>LARTIUS On safeguard 921 he came to me, and did curse</p>
<p>Against the Volsces, for 922 they had so vilely 923</p>
<p>Yielded the town: he is retired 924 to Antium 925 .</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Spoke he of me? 15</p>
<p>LARTIUS He did, my lord.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS How? What?</p>
<p>LARTIUS How often he had met you sword to sword:</p>
<p>That of all things upon the earth, he hated</p>
<p>Your person most: that he would pawn his fortunes</p>
<p>To hopeless restitution 926 , so 927 he might</p>
<p>Be called your vanquisher.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS At Antium lives he?</p>
<p>LARTIUS At Antium.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS I wish I had a cause to seek him there,</p>
<p>To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.</p>
<p>Enter Sicinius and Brutus</p>
<p>Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,</p>
<p>The tongues o’th’common mouth. I do despise them,</p>
<p>For they do prank them 928 in authority,</p>
<p>Against all noble sufferance 929 .</p>
<p>SICINIUS Pass no further.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Ha? What is that?</p>
<p>BRUTUS It will be dangerous to go on. No further.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS What makes this change?</p>
<p>MENENIUS The matter?</p>
<p>COMINIUS Hath he not passed the noble and the common 930 ?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Cominius, no.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Have I had children’s voices?</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Tribunes, give way: he shall to th’market-place.</p>
<p>BRUTUS The people are incensed against him.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Stop, or all will fall in broil 931 .</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Are these your herd?</p>
<p>Must these have voices 932 , that can yield them now</p>
<p>And straight 933 disclaim their tongues? What are your offices 934
?</p>
<p>You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth 935 ?</p>
<p>Have you not set them on 936 ?</p>
<p>MENENIUS Be calm, be calm.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS It is a purposed 937 thing, and grows by plot,</p>
<p>To curb the will of the nobility:</p>
<p>Suffer’t, and live 938 with such as cannot rule</p>
<p>Nor ever will be ruled.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Call’t not a plot:</p>
<p>The people cry you mocked them, and of late 939 ,</p>
<p>When corn was given them gratis 940 , you repined 941 ,</p>
<p>Scandalled 942 the suppliants for the people, called them</p>
<p>Time-pleasers 943 , flatterers, foes to nobleness.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Why, this was known before.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Not to them all.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Have you informed them sithence 944 ?</p>
<p>BRUTUS How? I inform them?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS You are like 945 to do such business.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Not unlike each way to better yours 946 .</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Why then should I be consul? By yond 947 clouds,</p>
<p>Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me</p>
<p>Your fellow tribune.</p>
<p>SICINIUS You show too much of that 948</p>
<p>For which the people stir: if you will pass</p>
<p>To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,</p>
<p>Which you are out of 949 , with a gentler spirit,</p>
<p>Or never be so noble as a consul,</p>
<p>Nor yoke 950 with him for tribune.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Let’s be calm.</p>
<p>COMINIUS The people are abused 951 : set on. This palt’ring 952</p>
<p>Becomes not Rome: nor has Coriolanus</p>
<p>Deserved this so dishonoured 953 rub 954 , laid falsely 955</p>
<p>I’th’plain 956 way of his merit.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Tell me of corn?</p>
<p>This was my speech, and I will speak’t again—</p>
<p>MENENIUS Not now, not now.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Not in this heat, sir, now.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Now, as I live, I will.</p>
<p>My nobler friends, I crave their pardons:</p>
<p>For 957 the mutable, rank-scented meinie 958 ,</p>
<p>Let them regard 959 me, as I do not flatter,</p>
<p>And therein behold themselves 960 : I say again,</p>
<p>In soothing 961 them, we nourish gainst our senate</p>
<p>The cockle 962 of rebellion, insolence, sedition 963 ,</p>
<p>Which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed and scattered,</p>
<p>By mingling them with us, the honoured 964 number,</p>
<p>Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that</p>
<p>Which they have given to beggars.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Well, no more.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR No more words, we beseech you.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS How? No more?</p>
<p>As for my country I have shed my blood, 95</p>
<p>Not fearing outward force: so shall my lungs</p>
<p>Coin 965 words till their 966 decay against those measles 967</p>
<p>Which we disdain should tetter 968 us, yet sought 969</p>
<p>The very way to catch them.</p>
<p>BRUTUS You speak o’th’people as if you were a god 100</p>
<p>To punish, not a man of their infirmity 970 .</p>
<p>SICINIUS ’Twere well we let the people know’t.</p>
<p>MENENIUS What, what, his choler 971 ?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Choler? Were I as patient 972 as the midnight sleep,</p>
<p>By Jove, ’twould be my mind 973 .</p>
<p>SICINIUS It is a mind that shall remain a poison</p>
<p>Where it is, not poison any further.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Shall remain?</p>
<p>Hear you this Triton 974 of the minnows 975 ? Mark you</p>
<p>His absolute ‘shall’?</p>
<p>COMINIUS ’Twas from the canon 976 .</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS ‘Shall’? O good but most unwise patricians: why,</p>
<p>You grave but reckless senators, have you thus</p>
<p>Given 977 Hydra 978 here to choose an officer,</p>
<p>That with his peremptory 979 ‘shall’, being but</p>
<p>The horn and noise 980 o’th’monster’s, wants 981 not spirit</p>
<p>To say he’ll turn 982 your current 983 in a ditch,</p>
<p>And make your channel his? If he have power</p>
<p>Then vail 984 your ignorance 985 : if none, awake</p>
<p>Your dangerous lenity 986 . If you are learned,</p>
<p>Be not as common fools: if you are not,</p>
<p>Let them have cushions 987 by 988 you. You are plebeians,</p>
<p>If they be senators: and they are no less,</p>
<p>When, both your voices 989 blended, the great’st taste</p>
<p>Most palates theirs 990 . They choose their magistrate,</p>
<p>And such a one as he, who puts his ‘shall’,</p>
<p>His popular 991 ‘shall’, against a graver 992 bench 993</p>
<p>Than ever frowned in Greece. By Jove himself,</p>
<p>It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches</p>
<p>To know, when two authorities are up 994 ,</p>
<p>Neither supreme, how soon confusion 995</p>
<p>May enter ’twixt the gap of both 996 , and take 997</p>
<p>The one by 998 th’other.</p>
<p>COMINIUS Well, on to th’market-place.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Whoever gave that counsel to give forth</p>
<p>The corn o’th’storehouse gratis, as ’twas used</p>
<p>Sometime 999 in Greece—</p>
<p>MENENIUS Well, well, no more of that.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Though there the people had more absolute power,</p>
<p>I say, they nourished disobedience, fed</p>
<p>The ruin of the state.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Why shall the people give</p>
<p>One that speaks thus their voice 1000 ?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS I’ll give my reasons,</p>
<p>More worthier than their voices. They know the corn</p>
<p>Was not our recompense 1001 , resting well assured</p>
<p>They ne’er did service for’t: being pressed 1002 to th’war,</p>
<p>Even when the navel 1003 of the state was touched 1004 ,</p>
<p>They would not thread 1005 the gates: this kind of service</p>
<p>Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i’th’war,</p>
<p>Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they showed</p>
<p>Most valour, spoke not for 1006 them. Th’accusation</p>
<p>Which they have often made against the senate,</p>
<p>All cause unborn 1007 , could never be the native 1008</p>
<p>Of our so frank 1009 donation. Well, what then?</p>
<p>How shall this bosom multiplied 1010 digest 1011</p>
<p>The senate’s courtesy? Let deeds express</p>
<p>What’s like 1012 to be their words: ’We did request it,</p>
<p>We are the greater poll 1013 1014 , and in true fear</p>
<p>They gave us our demands.’ Thus we debase</p>
<p>The nature of our seats, and make the rabble</p>
<p>Call our cares 1015 fears, which will in time</p>
<p>Break ope the locks o’th’senate, and bring in</p>
<p>The crows 1016 to peck the eagles 1017 .</p>
<p>MENENIUS Come, enough.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Enough with over-measure 1018 .</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS No, take more.</p>
<p>What may be sworn by, both divine and human,</p>
<p>Seal 1019 what I end withal 1020 . This double worship 1021 ,</p>
<p>Where one part does disdain with cause, the other</p>
<p>Insult 1022 without al 1023 l reason: where gentry 1024 , title,
wisdom,</p>
<p>Cannot conclude 1025 but by the yea and no</p>
<p>Of general 1026 ignorance, it must omit 1027</p>
<p>Real necessities, and give way the while 1028</p>
<p>To unstable slightness 1029 . Purpose so barred 1030 , it
follows,</p>
<p>Nothing is done to purpose 1031 . Therefore, beseech you —</p>
<p>You that will be less fearful 1032 than discreet 1033 ,</p>
<p>That love the fundamental part of state</p>
<p>More than you doubt the change on’t 1034 , that prefer</p>
<p>A noble life before a long, and wish</p>
<p>To jump 1035 a body with a dangerous physic 1036</p>
<p>That’s sure of death without it — at once pluck out</p>
<p>The multitudinous tongue 1037 : let them not lick</p>
<p>The sweet 1038 which is their poison. Your dishonour 1039</p>
<p>Mangles true judgement, and bereaves 1040 the state</p>
<p>Of that integrity 1041 which should become’t,</p>
<p>Not having the power to do the good it would,</p>
<p>For th’ill 1042 which doth control’t.</p>
<p>BRUTUS He’s said enough.</p>
<p>SICINIUS He’s spoken like a traitor, and shall answer 1043</p>
<p>As traitors do.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Thou wretch, despite 1044 o’erwhelm thee!</p>
<p>What should the people do with these bald 1045 tribunes?</p>
<p>On whom depending, their obedience fails</p>
<p>To th’greater bench 1046 ? In a rebellion,</p>
<p>When what’s not meet, but what must be, was law 1047 ,</p>
<p>Then were they chosen: in a better hour,</p>
<p>Let what is meet 1048 be said it must be meet,</p>
<p>And throw their power i’th’dust.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Manifest treason.</p>
<p>SICINIUS This a consul? No.</p>
<p>BRUTUS The aediles 1049 , ho!</p>
<p>Enter an Aedile</p>
<p>Let him be apprehended 1050 .</p>
<p>SICINIUS Go, call the people:—</p>
<p>[Exit Aedile ]</p>
<p>in whose name myself</p>
<p>To Coriolanus</p>
<p>Attach 1051 thee as a traitorous innovator 1052 ,</p>
<p>A foe to th’public weal 1053 . Obey, I charge thee,</p>
<p>And follow to thine answer 1054 .</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Hence, old goat!</p>
<p>ALL PATRICIANS We’ll surety 1055 him.</p>
<p>COMINIUS Agèd sir, hands off.</p>
<p>To Sicinius</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Hence, rotten thing, or I shall shake thy bones</p>
<p>To Sicinius</p>
<p>Out of thy garments.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Help, ye citizens!</p>
<p>Enter a rabble of Plebeians [Citizens ] with the Aediles</p>
<p>MENENIUS On both sides more respect.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Here’s he that would take from you all your power.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Seize him, aediles!</p>
<p>ALL CITIZENS Down with him, down with him!</p>
<p>SECOND SENATOR Weapons, weapons, weapons!</p>
<p>They all bustle about Coriolanus</p>
<p>Tribunes! Patricians! Citizens! What, ho!</p>
<p>Sicinius! Brutus! Coriolanus! Citizens!</p>
<p>ALL Peace, peace, peace! Stay, hold, peace!</p>
<p>MENENIUS What is about to be? I am out of breath:</p>
<p>Confusion 1056 ’s near: I cannot speak. You, tribunes</p>
<p>To th’people, Coriolanus, patience!</p>
<p>Speak, good Sicinius.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Hear me, people, peace.</p>
<p>ALL CITIZENS Let’s hear our tribune: peace! Speak, speak, speak!</p>
<p>SICINIUS You are at point to lose 1057 your liberties:</p>
<p>MARTIUS would have all from you: Martius,</p>
<p>Whom late you have named for consul.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Fie, fie, fie, this is the way to kindle, not to quench.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.</p>
<p>SICINIUS What is the city but the people?</p>
<p>ALL CITIZENS True, the people are the city.</p>
<p>BRUTUS By the consent of all, we were established the people’s
magistrates.</p>
<p>ALL CITIZENS You so remain.</p>
<p>MENENIUS And so are like to do.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS That is the way to lay the city flat,</p>
<p>To bring the roof to the foundation,</p>
<p>And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges 1058 ,</p>
<p>In heaps and piles of ruin.</p>
<p>SICINIUS This deserves death.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Or 1059 let us stand to 1060 our authority,</p>
<p>Or let us lose it: we do here pronounce,</p>
<p>Upon the part 1061 o’th’people, in whose power</p>
<p>We were elected theirs, Martius is worthy</p>
<p>Of present 1062 death.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Therefore lay hold of him:</p>
<p>Bear him to th’rock Tarpeian 1063 , and from thence</p>
<p>Into destruction cast him.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Aediles, seize him.</p>
<p>ALL CITIZENS Yield, Martius, yield.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Hear me one word: beseech you, tribunes,</p>
<p>Hear me but a word.</p>
<p>AEDILES Peace, peace!</p>
<p>MENENIUS Be that 1064 you seem, truly your country’s friend,</p>
<p>And temp’rately 1065 proceed to what you would</p>
<p>Thus violently redress.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Sir, those cold 1066 ways,</p>
<p>That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous</p>
<p>Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,</p>
<p>And bear him to the rock.</p>
<p>Coriolanus draws his sword</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS No, I’ll die here:</p>
<p>There’s some among you have beheld me fighting:</p>
<p>Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me 1067 .</p>
<p>MENENIUS Down with that sword: tribunes, withdraw a while.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Lay hands upon him.</p>
<p>COMINIUS Help Martius, help! You that be noble, help him, young and
old.</p>
<p>ALL CITIZENS Down with him, down with him.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>In this mutiny, the Tribunes, the Aediles and the people are beat in
1068</p>
<p>MENENIUS Go, get you to your house: be gone, away!</p>
<p>All will be naught 1069 else 1070 .</p>
<p>SECOND SENATOR Get you gone.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Stand fast: we have as many friends as enemies.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Shall it be put to that?</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR The gods forbid!</p>
<p>I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house:</p>
<p>Leave us to cure this cause 1071 .</p>
<p>MENENIUS For ’tis a sore upon us,</p>
<p>You cannot tent 1072 yourself: be gone, beseech you.</p>
<p>COMINIUS Come, sir, along with us.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS I would they were barbarians, as they are,</p>
<p>Though in Rome littered 1073 : not Romans, as they are not,</p>
<p>Though calved i’th’porch o’th’Capitol.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Be gone:</p>
<p>Put not your worthy rage into your tongue:</p>
<p>One time will owe another 1074 .</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS On fair ground I could beat forty of them.</p>
<p>MENENIUS I could myself take up 1075 a brace o’th’best of them, yea,
the two tribunes.</p>
<p>COMINIUS But now ’tis odds beyond arithmetic 1076 ,</p>
<p>And manhood 1077 is called foolery 1078 when it stands</p>
<p>Against a falling fabric 1079 . Will you hence,</p>
<p>Before the tag 1080 return, whose rage doth rend 1081</p>
<p>Like interrupted 1082 waters and o’erbear</p>
<p>What they are used to bear 1083 ?</p>
<p>MENENIUS Pray you be gone:</p>
<p>To Coriolanus</p>
<p>I’ll try whether my old wit be in request</p>
<p>With 1084 those that have but little: this must be patched</p>
<p>With cloth of any colour 1085 .</p>
<p>COMINIUS Nay, come away.</p>
<p>Exeunt Coriolanus and Cominius</p>
<p>A PATRICIAN This man has marred his fortune.</p>
<p>MENENIUS His nature is too noble for the world:</p>
<p>He would not flatter Neptune 1086 for his trident,</p>
<p>Or Jove for’s power to thunder 1087 : his heart’s his mouth 1088
:</p>
<p>What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent,</p>
<p>And, being angry, does forget that ever</p>
<p>He heard the name of death.</p>
<p>A noise within</p>
<p>Here’s goodly work.</p>
<p>A PATRICIAN I would they were abed.</p>
<p>MENENIUS I would they were in Tiber 1089 . What the vengeance!
1090</p>
<p>Could he not speak ’em fair 1091 ?</p>
<p>Enter Brutus and Sicinius with the rabble again</p>
<p>SICINIUS Where is this viper</p>
<p>That would depopulate the city and</p>
<p>Be every man himself?</p>
<p>MENENIUS You worthy tribunes—</p>
<p>SICINIUS He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock</p>
<p>With rigorous 1092 hands: he hath resisted law,</p>
<p>And therefore law shall scorn 1093 him further trial</p>
<p>Than the severity of the public power</p>
<p>Which he so sets 1094 at naught.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN He shall well know the noble tribunes are</p>
<p>The people’s mouths, and we their hands.</p>
<p>ALL CITIZENS He shall, sure on’t 1095 .</p>
<p>MENENIUS Sir, sir—</p>
<p>SICINIUS Peace!</p>
<p>MENENIUS Do not cry havoc 1096 where you should but hunt</p>
<p>With modest warrant 1097 .</p>
<p>SICINIUS Sir, how com’st that you have holp 1098</p>
<p>To make this rescue 1099 ?</p>
<p>MENENIUS Hear me speak: as I do know</p>
<p>The consul’s worthiness, so can I name his faults.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Consul? What consul?</p>
<p>MENENIUS The consul Coriolanus.</p>
<p>BRUTUS He consul?</p>
<p>ALL CITIZENS No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>MENENIUS If, by the tribunes’ leave 1100 , and yours, good
people,</p>
<p>I may be heard, I would crave a word or two,</p>
<p>The which shall turn you to no further harm</p>
<p>Than so much loss of time.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Speak briefly then,</p>
<p>For we are peremptory 1101 to dispatch</p>
<p>This viperous traitor: to eject him hence 1102</p>
<p>Were but our danger, and to keep him here</p>
<p>Our certain death: therefore it is decreed</p>
<p>He dies tonight.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Now the good gods forbid</p>
<p>That our renownèd Rome, whose gratitude</p>
<p>Towards her deservèd 1103 children is enrolled 1104</p>
<p>In Jove’s own book, like an unnatural dam 1105</p>
<p>Should now eat up her own!</p>
<p>SICINIUS He’s a disease that must be cut away.</p>
<p>MENENIUS O, he’s a limb that has but a disease:</p>
<p>Mortal 1106 to cut it off: to cure it, easy.</p>
<p>What has he done to Rome that’s worthy death?</p>
<p>Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost —</p>
<p>Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath</p>
<p>By many an ounce — he dropped it for his country:</p>
<p>And what is left, to lose it by 1107 his country,</p>
<p>Were to us all that do’t and suffer 1108 it,</p>
<p>A brand 1109 to th’end o’th’world.</p>
<p>SICINIUS This is clean cam 1110 1111 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS Merely 1112 awry:</p>
<p>When he did love his country, it honoured him.</p>
<p>MENENIUS The service of the foot,</p>
<p>Being once gangrened, is not then respected</p>
<p>For what before it was.</p>
<p>BRUTUS We’ll hear no more:</p>
<p>Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence,</p>
<p>Lest his infection, being of catching nature,</p>
<p>Spread further.</p>
<p>MENENIUS One word more, one word:</p>
<p>This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find</p>
<p>The harm of unscanned 1113 swiftness, will too late</p>
<p>Tie leaden pounds to’s 1114 heels. Proceed by process 1115 ,</p>
<p>Lest parties 1116 , as he is beloved, break out,</p>
<p>And sack great Rome with Romans.</p>
<p>BRUTUS If it were so?</p>
<p>SICINIUS What 1117 do ye talk?</p>
<p>To Menenius</p>
<p>Have we not had a taste of his obedience?</p>
<p>Our aediles smote 1118 , ourselves resisted? Come.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Consider this: he has been bred i’th’wars</p>
<p>Since a 1119 could draw a sword, and is ill-schooled 380</p>
<p>In bolted 1120 language: meal and bran 1121 together</p>
<p>He throws without distinction. Give me leave,</p>
<p>I’ll go to him, and undertake to bring him</p>
<p>Where he shall answer by a lawful form,</p>
<p>In peace, to his utmost peril 1122 .</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Noble tribunes,</p>
<p>It is the humane way: the other course</p>
<p>Will prove too bloody, and the end of it</p>
<p>Unknown to the beginning 1123 .</p>
<p>SICINIUS Noble Menenius, 390</p>
<p>Be you then as the people’s officer:</p>
<p>Masters, lay down your weapons.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Go not home.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Meet on the market-place: we’ll attend 1124 you there,</p>
<p>Where, if you bring not Martius, we’ll proceed 395</p>
<p>In our first way.</p>
<p>MENENIUS I’ll bring him to you.</p>
<p>Let me desire your company: he must come,</p>
<p>To the Senators</p>
<p>Or what is worst will follow.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Pray you, let’s to him.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
