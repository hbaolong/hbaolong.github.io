<h4 id="scene-1-2-running-scene-1">Scene 1 2 ／running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter Theseus 3 , Hippolyta, with others [Philostrate and attendants
]</p>
<p>THESEUS Now, fair Hippolyta 4 , our nuptial hour</p>
<p>Draws on apace 5 . Four happy days 6 bring in</p>
<p>Another moon: but O, methinks, how slow</p>
<p>This old moon wanes; she lingers 7 my desires,</p>
<p>Like to 8 a stepdame 9 or a dowager 10</p>
<p>Long withering out 11 a young man’s revenue 12 .</p>
<p>HIPPOLYTA Four days will quickly steep 13 themselves in nights,</p>
<p>Four nights will quickly dream away the time.</p>
<p>And then the moon, like to a silver bow 14</p>
<p>New-bent 15 in heaven, shall behold the night</p>
<p>Of our solemnities 16 .</p>
<p>THESEUS Go, Philostrate,</p>
<p>Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments,</p>
<p>Awake the pert 17 and nimble spirit of mirth,</p>
<p>Turn melancholy forth to funerals:</p>
<p>The pale companion 18 is not for our pomp 19 .</p>
<p>[Exit Philostrate ]</p>
<p>Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword 20 ,</p>
<p>And won thy love doing thee injuries 21 .</p>
<p>But I will wed thee in another key,</p>
<p>With pomp, with triumph 22 and with revelling.</p>
<p>Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia 23 , Lysander 24 and Demetrius
25</p>
<p>EGEUS Happy be Theseus, our renownèd duke.</p>
<p>THESEUS Thanks, good Egeus: what’s the news with thee?</p>
<p>EGEUS Full of vexation come I, with complaint</p>
<p>Against my child, my daughter Hermia.</p>
<p>Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,</p>
<p>This man hath my consent to marry her.</p>
<p>Stand forth, Lysander. And my gracious duke,</p>
<p>This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.—</p>
<p>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,</p>
<p>And interchanged love-tokens with my child.</p>
<p>Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,</p>
<p>With feigning 26 voice verses of feigning love,</p>
<p>And stol’n the impression of her fantasy 27</p>
<p>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds 28 , conceits 29 ,</p>
<p>Knacks 30 , trifles 31 , nosegays 32 , sweetmeats 33 — messengers</p>
<p>Of strong prevailment 34 in unhardened 35 youth —</p>
<p>With cunning hast thou filched 36 my daughter’s heart,</p>
<p>Turned her obedience, which is due to me,</p>
<p>To stubborn harshness.— And, my gracious duke,</p>
<p>Be it so 37 she will not here before your grace</p>
<p>Consent to marry with Demetrius,</p>
<p>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:</p>
<p>As she is mine, I may dispose of her;</p>
<p>Which shall be either to this gentleman</p>
<p>Or to her death, according to our law</p>
<p>Immediately 38 provided in that case.</p>
<p>THESEUS What say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid,</p>
<p>To you your father should be as a god,</p>
<p>One that composed your beauties, yea, and one</p>
<p>To whom you are but as a form in wax</p>
<p>By him imprinted and within his power</p>
<p>To leave the figure or disfigure 39 it.</p>
<p>Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</p>
<p>HERMIA So is Lysander.</p>
<p>THESEUS In himself he is.</p>
<p>But in this kind 40 , wanting 41 your father’s voice 42 ,</p>
<p>The other must be held the worthier.</p>
<p>HERMIA I would 43 my father looked but with my eyes.</p>
<p>THESEUS Rather your eyes must with his judgement look.</p>
<p>HERMIA I do entreat your grace to pardon me.</p>
<p>I know not by what power I am made bold,</p>
<p>Nor how it may concern 44 my modesty</p>
<p>In such a presence 45 here to plead my thoughts:</p>
<p>But I beseech your grace that I may know</p>
<p>The worst that may befall me in this case,</p>
<p>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</p>
<p>THESEUS Either to die the death 46 or to abjure</p>
<p>Forever the society 47 of men.</p>
<p>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,</p>
<p>Know of 48 your youth, examine well your blood 49 ,</p>
<p>Whether, if you yield not to your father’s choice,</p>
<p>You can endure the livery 50 of a nun,</p>
<p>For aye 51 to be in shady cloister mewed 52 ,</p>
<p>To live a barren sister all your life,</p>
<p>Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.</p>
<p>Thrice blessèd they that master so their blood,</p>
<p>To undergo such maiden pilgrimage.</p>
<p>But earthlier happy 53 is the rose distilled 54</p>
<p>Than that which withering on the virgin thorn</p>
<p>Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness 55 .</p>
<p>HERMIA So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</p>
<p>Ere 56 I will yield my virgin patent 57 up</p>
<p>Unto his lordship 58 , whose unwishèd yoke</p>
<p>My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</p>
<p>THESEUS Take time to pause, and by the next new moon —</p>
<p>The sealing day 59 betwixt my love and me,</p>
<p>For everlasting bond of fellowship —</p>
<p>Upon that day either prepare to die</p>
<p>For disobedience to your father’s will,</p>
<p>Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would 60 ,</p>
<p>Or on Diana 61 ’s altar to protest 62</p>
<p>For aye 63 austerity and single life.</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Relent, sweet Hermia.— And, Lysander, yield</p>
<p>Thy crazèd 64 title 65 to my certain right.</p>
<p>LYSANDER You have her father’s love, Demetrius:</p>
<p>Let me have Hermia’s. Do 66 you marry him.</p>
<p>EGEUS Scornful Lysander! True, he hath my love;</p>
<p>And what is mine my love shall render 67 him.</p>
<p>And she is mine, and all my right of her</p>
<p>I do estate unto 68 Demetrius.</p>
<p>LYSANDER I am, my lord, as well derived 69 as he,</p>
<p>As well possessed 70 : my love is more than his,</p>
<p>My fortunes every way as fairly 71 ranked,</p>
<p>If not with vantage, as Demetrius’ 72 ,</p>
<p>And, which is more than all these boasts can be,</p>
<p>I am beloved of beauteous Hermia.</p>
<p>Why should not I then prosecute 73 my right?</p>
<p>Demetrius, I’ll avouch 74 it to his head 75 ,</p>
<p>Made love to 76 Nedar’s daughter, Helena 77 ,</p>
<p>And won her soul: and she, sweet lady, dotes 78 ,</p>
<p>Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,</p>
<p>Upon this spotted 79 and inconstant man.</p>
<p>THESEUS I must confess that I have heard so much,</p>
<p>And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof,</p>
<p>But, being over-full of self-affairs 80 ,</p>
<p>My mind did lose 81 it. But, Demetrius, come,</p>
<p>And come, Egeus, you shall go with me.</p>
<p>I have some private schooling 82 for you both.</p>
<p>For you, fair Hermia, look 83 you arm 84 yourself</p>
<p>To fit your fancies 85 to your father’s will,</p>
<p>Or else the law of Athens yields you up —</p>
<p>Which by no means we may extenuate 86 —</p>
<p>To death or to a vow of single life.—</p>
<p>Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?—</p>
<p>Demetrius and Egeus, go 87 along:</p>
<p>I must employ you in some business</p>
<p>Against 88 our nuptial and confer with you</p>
<p>Of something nearly that 89 concerns yourselves.</p>
<p>EGEUS With duty and desire we follow you.</p>
<p>Exeunt all but Lysander and Hermia</p>
<p>LYSANDER How now, my love! Why is your cheek so pale?</p>
<p>How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</p>
<p>HERMIA Belike 90 for want of rain, which I could well</p>
<p>Beteem 91 them from the tempest of mine eyes.</p>
<p>LYSANDER Ay me, for aught 92 that I could ever read,</p>
<p>Could ever hear by tale or history,</p>
<p>The course of true love never did run smooth.</p>
<p>But either it was different in blood 93 —</p>
<p>HERMIA O cross 94 ! Too high to be enthralled to low.</p>
<p>LYSANDER Or else misgraffèd 95 in respect of years—</p>
<p>HERMIA O spite! Too old to be engaged to young.</p>
<p>LYSANDER Or else it stood 96 upon the choice of merit 97 —</p>
<p>HERMIA O hell! To choose love by another’s eyes.</p>
<p>LYSANDER Or if there were a sympathy 98 in choice,</p>
<p>War, death or sickness did lay siege to it,</p>
<p>Making it momentary 99 as a sound,</p>
<p>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream:</p>
<p>Brief as the lightning in the collied 100 night,</p>
<p>That in a spleen 101 unfolds 102 both heaven and earth,</p>
<p>And ere 103 a man hath power to say ‘Behold!’</p>
<p>The jaws of darkness do devour it up:</p>
<p>So quick 104 bright things come to confusion 105 .</p>
<p>HERMIA If then true lovers have been ever crossed 106 ,</p>
<p>It stands as an edict in destiny.</p>
<p>Then let us teach our trial 107 patience,</p>
<p>Because it is a customary cross,</p>
<p>As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,</p>
<p>Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s 108 followers.</p>
<p>LYSANDER A good persuasion 109 . Therefore hear me, Hermia.</p>
<p>I have a widow aunt, a dowager</p>
<p>Of great revenue, and she hath no child.</p>
<p>From Athens is her house removed seven leagues 110 ,</p>
<p>And she respects 111 me as her only son.</p>
<p>There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,</p>
<p>And to that place the sharp Athenian law</p>
<p>Cannot pursue us. If thou lov’st me, then</p>
<p>Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night,</p>
<p>And in the wood, a league without 112 the town,</p>
<p>Where I did meet thee once with Helena,</p>
<p>To do observance to a morn of May 113 ,</p>
<p>There will I stay 114 for thee.</p>
<p>HERMIA My good Lysander!</p>
<p>I swear to thee, by Cupid 115 ’s strongest bow,</p>
<p>By his best arrow with the golden head 116 ,</p>
<p>By the simplicity 117 of Venus’ doves 118 ,</p>
<p>By that which knitteth 119 souls and prospers love,</p>
<p>And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen 120 ,</p>
<p>When the false Troyan 121 under sail was seen,</p>
<p>By all the vows that ever men have broke,</p>
<p>In number more than ever women spoke,</p>
<p>In that same place thou hast appointed me,</p>
<p>Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.</p>
<p>LYSANDER Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</p>
<p>Enter Helena</p>
<p>HERMIA God speed fair 122 Helena, whither away?</p>
<p>HELENA Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.</p>
<p>Demetrius loves your fair: O happy 123 fair!</p>
<p>Your eyes are lodestars 124 , and your tongue’s sweet air 125</p>
<p>More tuneable 126 than lark to shepherd’s ear</p>
<p>When wheat is green 127 , when hawthorn buds appear.</p>
<p>Sickness is catching: O, were favour 128 so,</p>
<p>Your words I catch 129 , fair Hermia, ere I go,</p>
<p>My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,</p>
<p>My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.</p>
<p>Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated 130 ,</p>
<p>The rest I’ll give to be to you translated 131 .</p>
<p>O, teach me how you look, and with what art</p>
<p>You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart.</p>
<p>HERMIA I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.</p>
<p>HELENA O, that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!</p>
<p>HERMIA I give him curses, yet he gives me love.</p>
<p>HELENA O, that my prayers could such affection move 132 !</p>
<p>HERMIA The more I hate, the more he follows me.</p>
<p>HELENA The more I love, the more he hateth me.</p>
<p>HERMIA His folly, Helena, is none 133 of mine.</p>
<p>HELENA None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!</p>
<p>HERMIA Take comfort: he no more shall see my face.</p>
<p>Lysander and myself will fly 134 this place.</p>
<p>Before the time I did Lysander see,</p>
<p>Seemed Athens like a paradise to me.</p>
<p>O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,</p>
<p>That he hath turned a heaven into hell!</p>
<p>LYSANDER Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:</p>
<p>Tomorrow night, when Phoebe 135 doth behold</p>
<p>Her silver visage in the wat’ry glass 136 ,</p>
<p>Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,</p>
<p>A time that lovers’ flights doth still 137 conceal,</p>
<p>Through Athens’ gates have we devised to steal.</p>
<p>HERMIA And in the wood, where often you and I</p>
<p>Upon faint 138 primrose beds were wont 139 to lie,</p>
<p>Emptying our bosoms of their counsel 140 sweet,</p>
<p>There my Lysander and myself shall meet,</p>
<p>And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,</p>
<p>To seek new friends and strange 141 companions.</p>
<p>Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us,</p>
<p>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius! —</p>
<p>Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight</p>
<p>From lovers’ food till morrow deep midnight.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>LYSANDER I will, my Hermia.— Helena, adieu.</p>
<p>As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>HELENA How happy some o’er other some 142 can be!</p>
<p>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.</p>
<p>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so:</p>
<p>He will not know what all 143 but he doth know.</p>
<p>And as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,</p>
<p>So I, admiring of his qualities.</p>
<p>Things base and vile, holding no quantity 144 ,</p>
<p>Love can transpose to form 145 and dignity.</p>
<p>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,</p>
<p>And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind 146 .</p>
<p>Nor hath love’s mind of any judgement taste 147 ,</p>
<p>Wings and no eyes figure 148 unheedy haste.</p>
<p>And therefore is love said to be a child,</p>
<p>Because in choice he is often beguiled 149 .</p>
<p>As waggish 150 boys in game 151 themselves forswear 152 ,</p>
<p>So the boy love is perjured everywhere.</p>
<p>For ere Demetrius looked on Hermia’s eyne 153 ,</p>
<p>He hailed down oaths that he was only mine.</p>
<p>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</p>
<p>So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.</p>
<p>I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight:</p>
<p>Then to the wood will he tomorrow night</p>
<p>Pursue her; and for this intelligence 154 ,</p>
<p>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense 155 .</p>
<p>But herein mean I to enrich my pain,</p>
<p>To have his sight thither and back again.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
