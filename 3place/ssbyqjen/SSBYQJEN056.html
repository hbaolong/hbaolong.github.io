<p>Enter Mistress Ford and Mistress Page</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD What, John? What, Robert?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Quickly, quickly! Is the buck-basket 688 —</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD I warrant. What, Robin, I say!</p>
<p>[Enter John and Robert with a laundry basket ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Come, come, come.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Here, set it down.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Give your men the charge 689 , we must be brief.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be ready
here hard 690 by in the brew-house 691 , and when I suddenly call you,
come forth, and without any pause or staggering take this basket on your
shoulders: that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry it among
the whitsters 692 in Datchet Mead 693 , and there empty it in the muddy
ditch close by the Thames side.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE You will do it?</p>
<p>To John and Robert</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD I ha’ told them over and over, they lack no direction.
Be gone, and come when you are called.</p>
<p>[Exeunt John and Robert ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Here comes little Robin.</p>
<p>[Enter Robin ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD How now, my eyas-musket 694 ? What news with you?</p>
<p>ROBIN My master, Sir John, is come in at your back-door, Mistress
Ford, and requests your company.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE You little Jack-a-Lent 695 , have you been true to
us?</p>
<p>ROBIN Ay, I’ll be sworn. My master knows not of your being here and
hath threatened to put me into everlasting liberty 696 if I tell you of
it: for he swears he’ll turn me away 697 .</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Thou’rt a good boy. This secrecy of thine shall be a
tailor to thee, and shall make thee a new doublet and hose. I’ll go hide
me.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Do so.— Go tell thy master I am alone.</p>
<p>[Exit Robin ]</p>
<p>To Robin</p>
<p>Mistress Page, remember you your cue.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE I warrant thee: if I do not act it, hiss me.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Go to, then. We’ll use this unwholesome humidity 698 ,
this gross watery pumpion 699 . We’ll teach him to know turtles from
jays 700 .</p>
<p>[Enter Falstaff ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? 701 Why, now let me
die, for I have lived long enough: this is the period 702 of my
ambition. O this blessèd hour!</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD O sweet Sir John!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Mistress Ford, I cannot cog 703 , I cannot prate 704 ,
Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would thy husband were
dead. I’ll speak it before the best lord. I would make thee my lady.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD I your lady, Sir John? Alas, I should be a pitiful
lady!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Let the court of France show me such another. I see how
thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast the right arched beauty
of the brow that becomes the ship-tire 705 , the tire-valiant 706 , or
any tire of Venetian admittance 707 .</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD A plain kerchief 708 , Sir John: my brows become 709
nothing else, nor that well neither.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Thou art a tyrant to say so: thou wouldst make an absolute
710 courtier, and the firm fixture of thy foot 711 would give an
excellent motion to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale 712 . I see
what thou wert if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature thy friend 713 .
Come, thou canst not hide it.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Believe me, there’s no such thing in me.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF What made me love thee? Let that persuade thee there’s
something extraordinary in thee. Come, I cannot cog and say thou art
this and that, like a many of these lisping hawthorn-buds 714 that come
like women in men’s apparel and smell like Bucklersbury 715 in simple
time 716 . I cannot. But I love thee, none but thee — and thou deservest
it.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress
Page.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the Counter-gate
717 , which is as hateful to me as the reek 718 of a lime-kiln 719 .</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Well, heaven knows how I love you, and you shall one
day find it.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Keep in that mind, I’ll deserve it.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Nay, I must tell you, so you do, or else I could not be
in that mind.</p>
<p>ROBIN Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford, here’s Mistress Page at the door,
sweating and blowing 720 and looking wildly, and would needs speak with
you presently 721 .</p>
<p>Speaks within or enters</p>
<p>FALSTAFF She shall not see me: I will ensconce me 722 behind the
arras 723 .</p>
<p>Falstaff hides himself</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Pray you, do so: she’s a very tattling woman.</p>
<p>[Enter Mistress Page ]</p>
<p>Robin may enter here</p>
<p>What’s the matter? How now?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You’re shamed,
you’re overthrown, you’re undone 724 forever!</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD What’s the matter, good Mistress Page?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE O, well-a-day 725 , Mistress Ford, having an honest man
to 726 your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD What cause of suspicion?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE What cause of suspicion? Out upon you! 727 How am I
mistook in you?</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Why, alas, what’s the matter?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Your husband’s coming hither, woman, with all the
officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that he says is here now
in the house by your consent, to take an ill advantage of his absence.
You are undone.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD ’Tis not so, I hope.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man
here! But ’tis most certain your husband’s coming, with half Windsor at
his heels, to search for such a one. I come before to tell you. If you
know yourself clear 728 , why, I am glad of it: but if you have a friend
729 here, convey, convey him out. Be not amazed 730 , call all your
senses to you, defend your reputation, or bid farewell to your good life
731</p>
<p>forever.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD What shall I do? There is a gentleman my dear friend —
and I fear not mine own shame so much as his peril. I had rather than a
thousand pound he were out of the house.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE For shame, never stand 732 ‘you had rather’ and ‘you
had rather’. Your husband’s here at hand! Bethink you of some conveyance
733 — in the house you cannot hide him. O, how have you deceived me?
Look, here is a basket. If he be of any reasonable stature, he may creep
in here, and throw foul linen upon him, as if it were going to bucking.
Or — it is whiting-time 734 — send him by your two men to Datchet
Mead.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD He’s too big to go in there. What shall I do?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Let me see’t, let me see’t, O, let me see’t! I’ll in, I’ll
in. Follow your friend’s counsel. I’ll in.</p>
<p>Comes out of hiding</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE What, Sir John Falstaff? Are these your letters,
knight?</p>
<p>Aside to Falstaff</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I love thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here. I’ll
never—</p>
<p>Gets into the basket. They cover him with foul linen/To Robin</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Help to cover your master, boy.—</p>
<p>Call your men, Mistress Ford.— You dissembling 735 knight!</p>
<p>To Falstaff 736</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD What, John! Robert! John!</p>
<p>[Exit Robin ]</p>
<p>[Enter John and Robert ]</p>
<p>Go take up these clothes here quickly. Where’s the cowl-staff? Look,
how you drumble 737 ! Carry them to the laundress in Datchet Mead.
Quickly, come.</p>
<p>They attempt to fit the cowl-staff</p>
<p>[Enter Ford, Page, Caius and Evans ]</p>
<p>FORD Pray you, come near. If I suspect without cause, why then make
sport at me, then let me be your jest, I deserve it. How now? Whither
bear you this?</p>
<p>To Page, Caius and Evans</p>
<p>JOHN To the laundress, forsooth.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Why, what have you to do 738 whither they bear it? You
were best meddle with buck-washing 739 .</p>
<p>FORD Buck 740 ? I would I could wash myself of the buck! Buck, buck,
buck! Ay, buck! I warrant you, buck — and of the season 741 too, it
shall appear.</p>
<p>[Exeunt John and Robert with the basket ]</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I have dreamed tonight 742 . I’ll tell you my dream. Here,
here, here be my keys: ascend my chambers 743 , search, seek, find out.
I’ll warrant we’ll unkennel 744 the fox. Let me stop this way first. So,
now uncape 745 .</p>
<p>Locks the door</p>
<p>PAGE Good Master Ford, be contented 746 . You wrong yourself too
much.</p>
<p>FORD True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen. You shall see sport anon.
Follow me, gentlemen.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>EVANS This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.</p>
<p>CAIUS By gar, ’tis no the fashion of France: it is not jealous in
France.</p>
<p>PAGE Nay, follow him, gentlemen. See the issue of his search.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Page, Caius and Evans ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Is there not a double excellency in this?</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD I know not which pleases me better, that my husband is
deceived, or Sir John.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE What a taking 747 was he in, when your husband asked
who was in the basket!</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD I am half afraid he will have need of washing 748 , so
throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same
strain 749 were in the same distress.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD I think my husband hath some special suspicion of
Falstaff’s being here, for I never saw him so gross in his jealousy till
now.</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE I will lay a plot to try 750 that, and we will yet have
more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will scarce obey this
medicine.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Shall we send that foolish carrion 751 , Mistress
Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the water, and give him
another hope, to betray him to another punishment?</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE We will do it: let him be sent for tomorrow eight
o’clock to have amends.</p>
<p>[Enter Ford, Page, Caius and Evans ]</p>
<p>FORD I cannot find him. Maybe the knave bragged of that he could not
compass 752 .</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE Heard you that?</p>
<p>Aside to Mistress Ford</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD You use 753 me well, Master Ford, do you?</p>
<p>FORD Ay, I do so.</p>
<p>MISTRESS FORD Heaven make you better than your thoughts!</p>
<p>FORD Amen!</p>
<p>MISTRESS PAGE You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.</p>
<p>FORD Ay, ay, I must bear it.</p>
<p>EVANS If there be any pody in the house, and in the chambers, and in
the coffers, and in the presses 754 , heaven forgive my sins at the day
of judgement.</p>
<p>CAIUS By gar, nor I too. There is no bodies.</p>
<p>PAGE Fie, fie, Master Ford, are you not ashamed? What spirit, what
devil suggests this imagination? I would not ha’ your distemper in this
kind 755 for the wealth of Windsor Castle.</p>
<p>FORD ’Tis my fault, Master Page. I suffer for it.</p>
<p>EVANS You suffer for a pad conscience: your wife is as honest a
’omans as I will desires 756 among five thousand, and five hundred
too.</p>
<p>CAIUS By gar, I see ’tis an honest woman.</p>
<p>FORD Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in the park, I
pray you pardon me. I will hereafter make known to you why I have done
this. Come, wife, come, Mistress Page. I pray you pardon me. Pray
heartily pardon me.</p>
<p>PAGE Let’s go in, gentlemen, but trust me, we’ll mock him.—</p>
<p>To Caius and Evans</p>
<p>I do invite you tomorrow morning to my house to breakfast. After,
we’ll</p>
<p>To Ford, Caius and Evans</p>
<p>a-birding 757 together, I have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be
so?</p>
<p>FORD Anything.</p>
<p>EVANS If there is one, I shall make two in the company.</p>
<p>CAIUS If there be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.</p>
<p>FORD Pray you, go, Master Page.</p>
<p>[Exeunt all but Evans and Caius? ]</p>
<p>EVANS I pray you now remembrance tomorrow on the lousy knave, mine
host 758 .</p>
<p>CAIUS Dat is good, by gar, with all my heart.</p>
<p>EVANS A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
