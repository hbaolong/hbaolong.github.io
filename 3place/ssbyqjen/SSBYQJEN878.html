16</h4>
<p>Enter old Queen Margaret</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET So, now prosperity begins to mellow 1359</p>
<p>And drop into the rotten mouth of death.</p>
<p>Here in these confines 1360 slyly have I lurked,</p>
<p>To watch the waning of mine enemies.</p>
<p>A dire induction 1361 am I witness to,</p>
<p>And will to France, hoping the consequence 1362</p>
<p>Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.</p>
<p>Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret. Who comes here?</p>
<p>Enter Duchess [of York ] and Queen [Elizabeth ]</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah, my poor princes! Ah, my tender babes!</p>
<p>My unblowed 1363 flowers, new-appearing sweets 1364 !</p>
<p>If yet your gentle souls fly in the air</p>
<p>And be not fixed in doom perpetual 1365 ,</p>
<p>Hover about me with your airy wings</p>
<p>And hear your mother’s lamentation!</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Hover about her: say that right for right 1366</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Hath dimmed your infant morn to agèd night.</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK So many miseries have crazed 1367 my voice,</p>
<p>That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.</p>
<p>Edward Plantagenet 1368 , why art thou dead?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Plantagenet doth quit 1369 Plantagenet:</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Edward for Edward 1370 pays a dying debt.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,</p>
<p>And throw them in the entrails 1371 of the wolf?</p>
<p>When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET When holy Harry 1372 died, and my sweet son.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost,</p>
<p>Woe’s scene, world’s shame, grave’s due by life usurped 1373 ,</p>
<p>Brief abstract 1374 and record of tedious days,</p>
<p>Rest thy unrest on England’s lawful 1375 earth,</p>
<p>Sits down</p>
<p>Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood!</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah, that thou 1376 wouldst as soon afford 1377 a
grave</p>
<p>As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!</p>
<p>Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.</p>
<p>Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we?</p>
<p>Sits with her</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET If ancient sorrow be most reverend,</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>Give mine the benefit of seniory 1378 ,</p>
<p>And let my griefs frown on the upper hand 1379 .</p>
<p>If sorrow can admit society 1380 ,</p>
<p>Sits with them</p>
<p>I had an Edward 1381 , till a Richard killed him:</p>
<p>I had a husband 1382 , till a Richard killed him:</p>
<p>Thou hadst an Edward 1383 , till a Richard 1384 killed him:</p>
<p>Thou hadst a Richard 1385 , till a Richard killed him.</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;</p>
<p>I had a Rutland 1386 too, thou holp’st 1387 to kill him.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard killed him.</p>
<p>From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept</p>
<p>A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:</p>
<p>That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes 1388 ,</p>
<p>To worry 1389 lambs and lap their gentle blood,</p>
<p>That foul defacer of God’s handiwork 1390 ,</p>
<p>That reigns in gallèd 1391 eyes of weeping souls,</p>
<p>That excellent 1392 grand tyrant of the earth,</p>
<p>Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.</p>
<p>O upright 1393 , just, and true-disposing 1394 God,</p>
<p>How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur 1395</p>
<p>Preys on the issue 1396 of his mother’s body,</p>
<p>And makes her pew-fellow 1397 with others’ moan 1398 !</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK O Harry’s wife, triumph 1399 not in my woes!</p>
<p>God witness with me, I have wept for thine.</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Bear with me: I am hungry for revenge,</p>
<p>And now I cloy me 1400 with beholding it.</p>
<p>Thy Edward 1401 he is dead, that killed my Edward 1402 :</p>
<p>The other Edward 1403 dead, to quit my Edward:</p>
<p>Young York 1404 he is but boot 1405 , because both they 1406</p>
<p>Matched not the high perfection of my loss 1407 .</p>
<p>Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward,</p>
<p>And the beholders of this frantic 1408 play,</p>
<p>Th’adulterate 1409 Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,</p>
<p>Untimely smothered in their dusky graves.</p>
<p>Richard yet lives, hell’s black intelligencer 1410 ,</p>
<p>Only reserved 1411 their factor 1412 to buy souls</p>
<p>And send them thither. But at hand, at hand,</p>
<p>Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:</p>
<p>Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,</p>
<p>To have him suddenly conveyed from hence.</p>
<p>Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,</p>
<p>That I may live and say, ‘The dog is dead!’</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH O, thou didst prophesy the time would come</p>
<p>That I should wish for thee to help me curse</p>
<p>That bottled 1413 spider, that foul bunch-backed 1414 toad!</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET I called thee then vain flourish 1415 of my
fortune:</p>
<p>I called thee then poor shadow 1416 , painted 1417 queen,</p>
<p>The presentation 1418 of but what I was,</p>
<p>The flattering index 1419 of a direful pageant 1420 ,</p>
<p>One heaved a-high, to be hurled down below,</p>
<p>A mother only mocked 1421 with two fair babes,</p>
<p>A dream 1422 of what thou wast, a garish flag 1423 ,</p>
<p>To be the aim of every dangerous shot;</p>
<p>A sign 1424 of dignity 1425 , a breath, a bubble;</p>
<p>A queen in jest 1426 , only to fill the 1427 scene.</p>
<p>Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers?</p>
<p>Where be thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy?</p>
<p>Who sues 1428 , and kneels and says, ‘God save the queen’?</p>
<p>Where be the bending 1429 peers that flattered thee?</p>
<p>Where be the thronging troops 1430 that followed thee?</p>
<p>Decline 1431 all this, and see what now thou art:</p>
<p>For 1432 happy wife, a most distressèd widow:</p>
<p>For joyful mother, one that wails the name 1433 :</p>
<p>For one being sued to, one that humbly sues:</p>
<p>For queen, a very caitiff 1434 crowned with care 1435 :</p>
<p>For she that scorned at me, now scorned of 1436 me:</p>
<p>For she being feared of all, now fearing one:</p>
<p>For she commanding all, obeyed of none.</p>
<p>Thus hath the course of justice whirled about 1437 ,</p>
<p>And left thee but a very 1438 prey to time,</p>
<p>Having no more but thought 1439 of what thou wast,</p>
<p>To torture thee the more, being what thou art.</p>
<p>Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not</p>
<p>Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?</p>
<p>Now thy proud neck bears half my burdened yoke,</p>
<p>From which even here I slip my wearied head,</p>
<p>And leave the burden of it all on thee.</p>
<p>Farewell, York’s wife, and queen of sad mischance 1440 :</p>
<p>These English woes shall make me smile in France.</p>
<p>Starts to leave</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH O thou well skilled in curses, stay awhile,</p>
<p>And teach me how to curse mine enemies!</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Forbear 1441 to sleep the night, and fast the day:</p>
<p>Compare dead happiness with living woe:</p>
<p>Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,</p>
<p>And he that slew them fouler than he is.</p>
<p>Bett’ring 1442 thy loss makes the bad causer 1443 worse:</p>
<p>Revolving 1444 this will teach thee how to curse.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH My words are dull 1445 . O, quicken 1446 them with
thine!</p>
<p>QUEEN MARGARET Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like
mine.</p>
<p>Exit Margaret</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Why should calamity be full of words?</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Windy attorneys to their client’s woes 1447 ,</p>
<p>Airy succeeders of intestine 1448 joys,</p>
<p>Poor breathing orators of miseries!</p>
<p>Let them have scope 1449 : though what they will impart</p>
<p>Help nothing else, yet do they ease the heart.</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.</p>
<p>And in the breath of bitter words let’s smother</p>
<p>My damnèd son, that thy two sweet sons smothered.</p>
<p>Trumpet</p>
<p>The trumpet sounds: be copious in exclaims 1450 .</p>
<p>Enter King Richard and his train</p>
<p>RICHARD Who intercepts me in my expedition 1451 ?</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK O, she that might 1452 have intercepted thee,</p>
<p>By strangling thee in her accursèd womb,</p>
<p>From 1453 all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown</p>
<p>Where’t should be branded 1454 , if that right were right,</p>
<p>The slaughter of the prince that owed 1455 that crown,</p>
<p>And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?</p>
<p>Tell me, thou villain 1456 slave, where are my children?</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother
Clarence?</p>
<p>And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Where is kind Hastings?</p>
<p>RICHARD A flourish 1457 , trumpets! Strike alarum 1458 , drums!</p>
<p>Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale 1459 women</p>
<p>Rail 1460 on the lord’s anointed 1461 . Strike, I say!</p>
<p>Flourish. Alarums</p>
<p>Either be patient and entreat me fair 1462 ,</p>
<p>Or with the clamorous report 1463 of war</p>
<p>Thus will I drown your exclamations.</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Art thou my son?</p>
<p>RICHARD Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Then patiently hear my impatience 1464 .</p>
<p>RICHARD Madam, I have a touch of your condition 1465 ,</p>
<p>That cannot brook the accent of reproof 1466 .</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK O, let me speak!</p>
<p>RICHARD Do then, but I’ll not hear.</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK I will be mild and gentle in my words.</p>
<p>RICHARD And brief, good mother, for I am in haste.</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Art thou so hasty? I have stayed 1467 for thee,</p>
<p>God knows, in torment and in agony.</p>
<p>RICHARD And came I not at last to comfort you?</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK No, by the holy rood 1468 , thou know’st it well,</p>
<p>Thou cam’st on earth to make the earth my hell.</p>
<p>A grievous burden was thy birth to me:</p>
<p>Tetchy 1469 and wayward 1470 was thy infancy:</p>
<p>Thy schooldays frightful 1471 , desp’rate 1472 , wild, and
furious:</p>
<p>Thy prime 1473 of manhood daring, bold, and venturous:</p>
<p>Thy age confirmed 1474 , proud, subtle, sly and bloody,</p>
<p>More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred 1475 .</p>
<p>What comfortable 1476 hour canst thou name,</p>
<p>That ever graced me with thy company?</p>
<p>RICHARD Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour 1477 , that called your grace
1478</p>
<p>To breakfast once forth 1479 of my company.</p>
<p>If I be so disgracious in your eye,</p>
<p>Let me march on and not offend you, madam.</p>
<p>Strike up the drum.</p>
<p>Drums</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK I prithee hear me speak.</p>
<p>RICHARD You speak too bitterly.</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Hear me a word,</p>
<p>For I shall never speak to thee again.</p>
<p>RICHARD So.</p>
<p>DUCHESS OF YORK Either thou wilt die, by God’s just ordinance
1480</p>
<p>Ere from this war thou turn 1481 a conqueror,</p>
<p>Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish</p>
<p>And never more behold thy face again.</p>
<p>Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,</p>
<p>Which in the day of battle tire 1482 thee more</p>
<p>Than all the complete 1483 armour that thou wear’st!</p>
<p>My prayers on the adverse party fight,</p>
<p>And there the little souls of Edward’s children</p>
<p>Whisper 1484 the spirits of thine enemies</p>
<p>And promise them success and victory.</p>
<p>Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end:</p>
<p>Shame serves 1485 thy life and doth 1486 thy death attend.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
Abides in me: I say amen to her.</p>
<p>RICHARD Stay, madam, I must talk a word with you.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH I have no more sons of the royal blood</p>
<p>For thee to slaughter: for my daughters, Richard,</p>
<p>They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens,</p>
<p>And therefore level 1487 not to hit their lives.</p>
<p>RICHARD You have a daughter called Elizabeth,</p>
<p>Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH And must she die for this? O, let her live,</p>
<p>And I’ll corrupt her manners 1488 , stain her beauty,</p>
<p>Slander myself as false 1489 to Edward’s bed,</p>
<p>Throw over her the veil 1490 of infamy:</p>
<p>So 1491 she may live unscarred of 1492 bleeding slaughter,</p>
<p>I will confess she was not Edward’s daughter.</p>
<p>RICHARD Wrong not her birth, she is a royal princess.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH To save her life, I’ll say she is not so.</p>
<p>RICHARD Her life is safest only in her birth 1493 .</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH And only in that safety died her brothers.</p>
<p>RICHARD Lo, at their birth good stars were opposite 1494 .</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH No, to their lives ill friends 1495 were contrary
1496 .</p>
<p>RICHARD All unavoided 1497 is the doom 1498 of destiny.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH True, when avoided grace 1499 makes destiny.</p>
<p>My babes were destined to a fairer 1500 death,</p>
<p>If grace had blessed thee with a fairer life.</p>
<p>RICHARD You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Cousins, indeed, and by their uncle cozened 1501</p>
<p>Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.</p>
<p>Whose hand soever 1502 lanched 1503 their tender hearts,</p>
<p>Thy head 1504 , all indirectly 1505 , gave direction.</p>
<p>No doubt the murd’rous knife was dull and blunt</p>
<p>Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,</p>
<p>To revel in the entrails of my lambs.</p>
<p>But that still use 1506 of grief makes wild grief tame,</p>
<p>My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys</p>
<p>Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes,</p>
<p>And I, in such a desp’rate bay 1507 of death,</p>
<p>Like a poor bark 1508 , of sails and tackling 1509 reft 1510 ,</p>
<p>Rush 1511 all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.</p>
<p>RICHARD Madam, so thrive I 1512 in my enterprise 1513</p>
<p>And dangerous success 1514 of bloody wars,</p>
<p>As 1515 I intend more good to you and yours,</p>
<p>Than ever you and yours by me were harmed.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH What good is covered with the face of heaven 1516
,</p>
<p>To be discovered 1517 , that can do me good?</p>
<p>RICHARD Th’advancement 1518 of your children, gentle lady.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Up to some scaffold 1519 , there to lose their
heads?</p>
<p>RICHARD Unto the dignity 1520 and height of fortune,</p>
<p>The high imperial type 1521 of this earth’s glory.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Flatter 1522 my sorrow with report of it:</p>
<p>Tell me what state 1523 , what dignity, what honour,</p>
<p>Canst thou demise 1524 to any child of mine?</p>
<p>RICHARD Even 1525 all I have; ay, and myself and all,</p>
<p>Will I withal endow 1526 a child of thine,</p>
<p>So 1527 in the Lethe 1528 of thy angry soul</p>
<p>Thou drown the sad remembrance 1529 of those wrongs</p>
<p>Which thou supposest I have done to thee.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Be brief, lest that the process 1530 of thy
kindness</p>
<p>Last longer telling 1531 than thy kindness’ date 1532 .</p>
<p>RICHARD Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH My daughter’s mother thinks 1533 it with her
soul.</p>
<p>RICHARD What do you think?</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH That thou dost love my daughter from 1534 thy
soul.</p>
<p>So from thy soul’s love didst thou love her brothers,</p>
<p>And from my heart’s love I do thank thee for it.</p>
<p>RICHARD Be not so hasty to confound 1535 my meaning:</p>
<p>I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter</p>
<p>And do intend to make her Queen of England.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Well then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?</p>
<p>RICHARD Even he that makes her queen. Who else should be?</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH What, thou?</p>
<p>RICHARD Even so. How 1536 think you of it?</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH How canst thou woo her?</p>
<p>RICHARD That I would learn of you,</p>
<p>As one being best acquainted with her humour 1537 .</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH And wilt thou learn of me?</p>
<p>RICHARD Madam, with all my heart.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,</p>
<p>A pair of bleeding hearts: thereon engrave 1538</p>
<p>‘Edward’ and ‘York’, then haply 1539 will she weep:</p>
<p>Therefore present to her — as sometime 1540 Margaret</p>
<p>Did to thy father, steeped in Rutland’s blood —</p>
<p>A handkerchief, which, say to her, did drain</p>
<p>The purple 1541 sap from her sweet brother’s body,</p>
<p>And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal 1542 .</p>
<p>If this inducement move her not to love,</p>
<p>Send her a letter of thy noble deeds:</p>
<p>Tell her thou mad’st away 1543 her uncle Clarence,</p>
<p>Her uncle Rivers, ay, and, for her sake,</p>
<p>Mad’st quick conveyance 1544 with her good aunt Anne.</p>
<p>RICHARD You mock me, madam: this is not the way</p>
<p>To win your daughter.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH There is no other way,</p>
<p>Unless thou couldst put on some other shape 1545 ,</p>
<p>And not be Richard that hath done all this.</p>
<p>RICHARD Say that I did all this for love of her.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,</p>
<p>Having bought love with such a bloody spoil 1546 .</p>
<p>RICHARD Look what 1547 is done cannot be now amended:</p>
<p>Men shall deal 1548 unadvisedly sometimes,</p>
<p>Which after-hours 1549 give leisure to repent.</p>
<p>If I did take the kingdom from your sons,</p>
<p>To make amends, I’ll give it to your daughter.</p>
<p>If I have killed the issue 1550 of your womb,</p>
<p>To quicken 1551 your increase 1552 , I will beget 1553</p>
<p>Mine issue of your blood upon 1554 your daughter.</p>
<p>A grandam’s name is little less in love</p>
<p>Than is the doting title of a mother;</p>
<p>They are as children but one step below,</p>
<p>Even of your mettle 1555 , of your very blood,</p>
<p>Of all one 1556 pain, save for a night of groans</p>
<p>Endured of her 1557 , for whom you bid like sorrow 1558 .</p>
<p>Your children were vexation to your youth,</p>
<p>But mine shall be a comfort to your age.</p>
<p>The loss you have is but a son being king,</p>
<p>And by that loss your daughter is made queen.</p>
<p>I cannot make you what amends I would 1559 :</p>
<p>Therefore accept such kindness as I can 1560 .</p>
<p>Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul</p>
<p>Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,</p>
<p>This fair alliance quickly shall call home</p>
<p>To high promotions and great dignity.</p>
<p>The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife</p>
<p>Familiarly 1561 shall call thy Dorset brother.</p>
<p>Again shall you be mother to a king,</p>
<p>And all the ruins of distressful times</p>
<p>Repaired with double riches of content.</p>
<p>What? We have many goodly days to see.</p>
<p>The liquid drops of tears that you have shed</p>
<p>Shall come again, transformed to orient 1562 pearl,</p>
<p>Advantaging 1563 their love 1564 with interest</p>
<p>Of ten times double gain of happiness.</p>
<p>Go then, my mother 1565 , to thy daughter go:</p>
<p>Make bold 1566 her bashful years with your experience,</p>
<p>Prepare her ears to hear a wooer’s tale,</p>
<p>Put in her tender heart th’aspiring flame</p>
<p>Of golden sovereignty, acquaint the princess</p>
<p>With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys.</p>
<p>And when this arm of mine hath chastisèd</p>
<p>The petty rebel, dull-brained Buckingham,</p>
<p>Bound with triumphant garlands will I come</p>
<p>And lead thy daughter to a conqueror’s bed:</p>
<p>To whom I will retail 1567 my conquest won,</p>
<p>And she shall be sole victoress 1568 , Caesar’s Caesar 1569 .</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH What were I best to say? Her father’s brother</p>
<p>Would be her lord 1570 ? Or shall I say her uncle?</p>
<p>Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?</p>
<p>Under what title shall I woo for thee,</p>
<p>That God, the law, my honour and her love,</p>
<p>Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?</p>
<p>RICHARD Infer 1571 fair England’s peace by this alliance.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Which she shall purchase with still lasting war 1572
.</p>
<p>RICHARD Tell her the king, that may command, entreats.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH That 1573 at her hands which the king’s king 1574
forbids.</p>
<p>RICHARD Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH To vail 1575 the title 1576 , as her mother doth.</p>
<p>RICHARD Say I will love her everlastingly.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH But how long shall that title ‘ever’ last?</p>
<p>RICHARD Sweetly in force 1577 unto her fair life’s end.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH But how long fairly 1578 shall her sweet life
last?</p>
<p>RICHARD As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH As long as hell and Richard likes of it.</p>
<p>RICHARD Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH But she, your subject, loathes 1579 such
sovereignty.</p>
<p>RICHARD Be eloquent in 1580 my behalf to her.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH An honest tale speeds 1581 best being plainly 1582
told.</p>
<p>RICHARD Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.</p>
<p>RICHARD Your reasons are too shallow and too quick 1583 .</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH O no, my reasons are too 1584 deep 1585 and dead:</p>
<p>Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.</p>
<p>RICHARD Harp not on that string, madam: that is past.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings 1586
break.</p>
<p>RICHARD Now, by my George 1587 , my garter 1588 and my crown—</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Profaned, dishonoured and the third usurped.</p>
<p>RICHARD I swear—</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH By nothing, for this is no oath:</p>
<p>Thy George, profaned, hath lost his 1589 lordly honour;</p>
<p>Thy garter, blemished, pawned his knightly virtue;</p>
<p>Thy crown, usurped, disgraced his kingly glory.</p>
<p>If something thou wouldst swear to be believed,</p>
<p>Swear then by something that thou hast not wronged.</p>
<p>RICHARD Then, by myself—</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Thyself is self-misused 1590 .</p>
<p>RICHARD Now, by the world—</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH ’Tis full of thy foul wrongs.</p>
<p>RICHARD My father’s death—</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Thy life hath it dishonoured.</p>
<p>RICHARD Why then, by heaven—</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Heaven’s wrong is most of all.</p>
<p>If thou didst fear to break an oath with him 1591 ,</p>
<p>The unity 1592 the king my husband made</p>
<p>Thou hadst 1593 not broken, nor my brothers died.</p>
<p>If thou hadst feared to break an oath by him,</p>
<p>Th’imperial metal, circling now thy head,</p>
<p>Had graced the tender temples of my child,</p>
<p>And both the princes had been breathing here,</p>
<p>Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,</p>
<p>Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.</p>
<p>What canst thou swear by now?</p>
<p>RICHARD The time to come.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH That thou hast wrongèd in the time o’erpast 1594
,</p>
<p>For I myself have many tears to wash</p>
<p>Hereafter 1595 time, for time past wronged by thee.</p>
<p>The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered,</p>
<p>Ungoverned 1596 youth, to wail it with their age 1597 :</p>
<p>The parents live whose children thou hast butchered,</p>
<p>Old barren plants, to wail it with 1598 their age.</p>
<p>Swear not by time to come, for that thou hast</p>
<p>Misused ere used, by time’s ill-used repast.</p>
<p>RICHARD As I intend to prosper and repent,</p>
<p>So thrive I 1599 in my dangerous affairs</p>
<p>Of hostile arms. Myself myself confound 1600 .</p>
<p>Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!</p>
<p>Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest.</p>
<p>Be opposite 1601 all planets of good luck</p>
<p>To my proceeding 1602 if, with dear heart’s love,</p>
<p>Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,</p>
<p>I tender not 1603 thy beauteous princely 1604 daughter.</p>
<p>In her consists my happiness and thine:</p>
<p>Without her, follows to myself and thee,</p>
<p>Herself, the land and many a Christian soul,</p>
<p>Death, desolation, ruin and decay.</p>
<p>It cannot be avoided but by this:</p>
<p>It will not be avoided but by this.</p>
<p>Therefore, dear mother — I must call you so —</p>
<p>Be the attorney 1605 of my love to her:</p>
<p>Plead 1606 what I will be, not what I have been:</p>
<p>Not my deserts 1607 , but what I will deserve.</p>
<p>Urge the necessity and state of times 1608 ,</p>
<p>And be not peevish found in great designs 1609 .</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Shall I be tempted of 1610 the devil thus?</p>
<p>RICHARD Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Shall I forget myself to be myself 1611 ?</p>
<p>RICHARD Ay, if yourself ’s remembrance wrong yourself 1612 .</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Yet thou didst kill my children.</p>
<p>RICHARD But in your daughter’s womb I bury them,</p>
<p>Where in that nest of spicery 1613 they will breed</p>
<p>Selves of themselves, to your recomforture 1614 .</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?</p>
<p>RICHARD And be a happy mother by the deed.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH I go. Write to me very shortly,</p>
<p>And you shall understand from me her mind 1615 .</p>
<p>RICHARD Bear her my true love’s kiss, and so, farewell.</p>
<p>Kisses her</p>
<p>Exit [Queen Elizabeth ]</p>
<p>Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!—</p>
<p>How now, what news?</p>
<p>Enter Ratcliffe [with Catesby following ]</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast</p>
<p>Rideth a puissant 1616 navy: to our shores</p>
<p>Throng many doubtful 1617 hollow-hearted 1618 friends,</p>
<p>Unarmed, and unresolved to beat them back.</p>
<p>’Tis thought that Richmond is their 1619 admiral,</p>
<p>And there they hull 1620 , expecting but the aid</p>
<p>Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.</p>
<p>RICHARD Some light-foot 1621 friend post 1622 to the Duke of
Norfolk:</p>
<p>Ratcliffe, thyself, or Catesby. Where is he?</p>
<p>CATESBY Here, my good lord.</p>
<p>RICHARD Catesby, fly to the duke.</p>
<p>CATESBY I will, my lord, with all convenient haste.</p>
<p>RICHARD Ratcliffe, come hither. Post to Salisbury.</p>
<p>When thou com’st thither— Dull, unmindful 1623 villain,</p>
<p>To Catesby</p>
<p>Why stay’st thou here, and go’st not to the duke?</p>
<p>CATESBY First, mighty liege, tell me your highness’ pleasure,</p>
<p>What from your grace I shall deliver to him.</p>
<p>RICHARD O, true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight</p>
<p>The greatest strength and power 1624 that he can make,</p>
<p>And meet me suddenly 1625 at Salisbury 1626 .</p>
<p>CATESBY I go.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?</p>
<p>RICHARD Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Your highness told me I should post before.</p>
<p>RICHARD My mind is changed.—</p>
<p>Enter Lord Stanley [Earl of Derby ]</p>
<p>Stanley, what news with you?</p>
<p>DERBY None good, my liege, to please you with the hearing,</p>
<p>Nor none so bad, but well 1627 may be reported.</p>
<p>RICHARD Hoyday 1628 , a riddle: neither good nor bad.</p>
<p>Why need’st thou run so many miles about,</p>
<p>When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest 1629 way?</p>
<p>Once more, what news?</p>
<p>DERBY Richmond is on the seas.</p>
<p>RICHARD There let him sink, and be the seas on him!</p>
<p>White-livered runagate 1630 , what doth he there?</p>
<p>DERBY I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.</p>
<p>RICHARD Well, as you guess?</p>
<p>DERBY Stirred up by Dorset, Buckingham and Morton,</p>
<p>He makes for England, here to claim the crown.</p>
<p>RICHARD Is the chair 1631 empty? Is the sword 1632 unswayed 1633
?</p>
<p>Is the king dead? The empire 1634 unpossessed 1635 ?</p>
<p>What heir of York is there alive but we?</p>
<p>And who is England’s king but great York’s heir?</p>
<p>Then tell me, what makes he 1636 upon the seas?</p>
<p>DERBY Unless for that 1637 , my liege, I cannot guess.</p>
<p>RICHARD Unless for that 1638 he comes to be your liege,</p>
<p>You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman 1639 comes.</p>
<p>Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.</p>
<p>DERBY No, my good lord: therefore mistrust me not.</p>
<p>RICHARD Where is thy power 1640 , then, to beat him back?</p>
<p>Where be thy tenants 1641 and thy followers?</p>
<p>Are they not now upon the western shore,</p>
<p>Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?</p>
<p>DERBY No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.</p>
<p>RICHARD Cold 1642 friends to me: what do they in the north,</p>
<p>When they should serve their sovereign in the west?</p>
<p>DERBY They have not been commanded, mighty king.</p>
<p>Pleaseth 1643 your majesty to give me leave,</p>
<p>I’ll muster up my friends and meet your grace</p>
<p>Where and what time your majesty shall please.</p>
<p>RICHARD Ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond.</p>
<p>But I’ll not trust thee.</p>
<p>DERBY Most mighty sovereign,</p>
<p>You have no cause to hold 1644 my friendship doubtful:</p>
<p>I never was nor never will be false.</p>
<p>RICHARD Go then and muster men, but, leave behind</p>
<p>Your son, George Stanley. Look 1645 your heart be firm,</p>
<p>Or else his head’s assurance 1646 is but frail.</p>
<p>DERBY So deal with him as I prove true to you.</p>
<p>Exit Stanley [Earl of Derby ]</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger</p>
<p>MESSENGER My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,</p>
<p>As I by friends am well advertisèd 1647 ,</p>
<p>Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate,</p>
<p>Bishop of Exeter, his elder brother,</p>
<p>With many more confederates, are in arms.</p>
<p>Enter another Messenger</p>
<p>SECOND MESSENGER In Kent, my liege, the Guildfords are in arms,</p>
<p>And every hour more competitors 1648</p>
<p>Flock to the rebels, and their power grows strong.</p>
<p>Enter another Messenger</p>
<p>THIRD MESSENGER My lord, the army of great Buckingham—</p>
<p>RICHARD Out on ye, owls 1649 ! Nothing but songs of death?</p>
<p>He striketh him</p>
<p>There, take thou that, till thou bring better news.</p>
<p>THIRD MESSENGER The news I have to tell your majesty</p>
<p>Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters 1650</p>
<p>Buckingham’s army is dispersed and scattered,</p>
<p>And he himself wandered away alone,</p>
<p>No man knows whither.</p>
<p>RICHARD I cry thee mercy 1651 :</p>
<p>There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>Hath any well-advisèd 1652 friend proclaimed</p>
<p>Reward to him that brings the traitor in?</p>
<p>THIRD MESSENGER Such proclamation hath been made, my lord.</p>
<p>Enter another Messenger</p>
<p>FOURTH MESSENGER Sir Thomas Lovell and Lord Marquis Dorset,</p>
<p>’Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.</p>
<p>But this good comfort bring I to your highness:</p>
<p>The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest.</p>
<p>Richmond, in Dorsetshire, sent out a boat</p>
<p>Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks</p>
<p>If they were his assistants 1653 , yea or no,</p>
<p>Who answered him they came from Buckingham</p>
<p>Upon his party 1654 : he, mistrusting them,</p>
<p>Hoised 1655 sail and made his course again for Brittany.</p>
<p>RICHARD March on, march on, since we are up in arms.</p>
<p>If not to fight with foreign enemies,</p>
<p>Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.</p>
<p>Enter Catesby</p>
<p>CATESBY My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken 1656 :</p>
<p>That is the best news. That the Earl of Richmond</p>
<p>Is with a mighty power landed at Milford 1657</p>
<p>Is colder 1658 news, but yet they must be told.</p>
<p>RICHARD Away towards Salisbury! While we reason 1659 here,</p>
<p>A royal battle might be won and lost.</p>
<p>Someone take order Buckingham be brought</p>
<p>To Salisbury. The rest march on with me.</p>
<p>Flourish. Exeunt</p>
