<h4 id="introduction-to-the-winters-tale">Introduction to The Winter’s
Tale</h4>
<p>In about 1590 the dramatist George Peele wrote a play called The Old
Wives’ Tale in which an old woman is asked to tell ‘a merry winter’s
tale’ in order to ‘drive away the time trimly’. ‘Once upon a time,’ she
begins, as all traditional storytellers do, ‘there was a king or a lord
or a duke that had a fair daughter, the fairest that ever was, as white
as snow and as red as blood: and once upon a time his daughter was
stolen away.’ An old wives’ or a winter’s tale is like a fairy story: it
is not supposed to be realistic and it is bound to have a happy ending.
Along the way, there will be magic, dreams, coincidences, children lost
and found. This is the style of play to which Shakespeare turned some
twenty years after Peele, in the final phase of his career.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s late plays have come to be known as ‘romances’.
Although neither the dramatist himself nor the compilers of the First
Folio used this generic classification, the term is helpful because it
gestures towards the origin of such stories in ancient Greek prose
romance, which was peopled by wanderers, separated lovers, oracles,
shepherds, and heroes who undergo narrow escapes from disaster. The
story of Apollonius of Tyre, the ultimate source for Shakespeare’s
co-written play Pericles , is a classic example of the genre. Robert
Greene, another dramatist who was prominent in the early 1590s, wrote
several prose romances in this tradition, among them Pandosto: The
Triumph of Time, the story that is dramatized in The Winter’s Tale. We
do not know exactly what led Shakespeare, some time after writing the
tragedies of Lear and Macbeth, to turn back to the style of Peele and
Greene. Always attuned to changes in the wind, perhaps he sensed that a
gentler mode of tragi-comedy and pastoral romance, with a distinctly
royalist agenda, suited the times: the King’s Men seem to have had
notable successes in these years with several dramas of this kind,
including a revival of the old anonymous play of Mucedorus, which even
featured an encounter with a bear.</p>
<p>The Winter’s Tale does not, however, begin in the world of romance.
The Sicilian opening of the story is full of court intrigue in the
manner of King Lear and sexual jealousy reminiscent of Othello. There
are accusations of conspiracy, a queen is tried for treason and a king
behaves like a tyrant. Only in the second half is there a redemptive
movement from court to country: the structure is similar to that of
Cymbeline, another Shakespearean tragi-comedy written around the same
time. In contrast to Sicilia, Bohemia is a place of benign chance, where
the flight of a falcon leads a prince to his future bride and a thieving
trickster inadvertently helps the plot towards its happy resolution. The
arts of the court give way to the harmonies of nature. Though this is to
over-simplify: Polixenes relies on ‘intelligence’ and disguise, then
threatens physical violence against Perdita. She is a princess assumed
to be a shepherdess, who dresses up as a queen and speaks of the need to
intermingle art and nature in the grafting of flowers: complex layers of
illusion are at work.</p>
<p>Critics have been much exercised by Leontes’ explosion of anger when
Hermione succeeds in persuading Polixenes to prolong his visit to
Sicilia after Leontes has failed to do so. Why does her courtesy lead
instantly to a false accusation of adultery? Has Leontes’ jealousy been
festering for a long time? Is he angry because a woman has come between
two close male friends (a Shakespearean obsession which runs from the
early Two Gentlemen of Verona through the sonnets to his last play, The
Two Noble Kinsmen )? Such questions are the prerogative of the reader
more than the spectator in the playhouse. An audience watching a play
can only work out a limited amount about the events that are imagined to
have occurred before the action begins, and in the theatrical experience
such events do not exist.</p>
<p>Theatrical attention is concentrated more on Leontes as he is than on
how he got there. In a puzzling, tortuous self-analysis concerning the
‘infection’ of his brains, he says that as mental states may be affected
by things unreal, such as dreams, so they may also be affected by things
that are real:</p>
<p>… Can thy dam, may’t be</p>
<p>Affection?— Thy intention stabs the centre.</p>
<p>Thou dost make possible things not so held,</p>
<p>Communicat’st with dreams — how can this be? —</p>
<p>With what’s unreal thou coactive art,</p>
<p>And fellow’st nothing. Then ’tis very credent</p>
<p>Thou mayst co-join with something, and thou dost,</p>
<p>And that beyond commission, and I find it,</p>
<p>And that to the infection of my brains</p>
<p>And hard’ning of my brows.</p>
<p>Both syntax and semantics are crabbed. Leontes’ fragmented sentences
are symptoms of his mental disintegration. The referent of the key word
‘affection’ is unstable: does it refer to the relationship between
Hermione and Polixenes or to Leontes’ own mental state? ‘Affection’
could denote their sexual desire or his strong feeling in response to
it, but the word could also signify delusion, sickness. The ambiguity is
revelatory precisely because Leontes can no longer distinguish between
what is going on in his own mind and the reality observed by everyone
else on stage. Hermione speaks truer than she knows when in the trial
scene she says ‘My life stands in the level of your dreams.’</p>
<p>The logical conclusion of Leontes’ analysis ought to be that the
thing that is exercising him, namely the supposed affair between his
wife and his best friend, is nothing but a bad dream. But he obstinately
draws the opposite conclusion. The irrationality of this move is itself
a sign of the ‘infection’ that is afflicting him. Honest Camillo sees
this, but, for the very reason that he is ‘infected’, Leontes himself
cannot. His ‘distraction’ makes him misinterpret every action, even as
his very language becomes infected with dark sexual double entendre :
‘stabs’, ‘nothing’ and ‘co-join’ anticipate the subsequent grossness of
‘no barricado for a belly’ and ‘she has been sluiced in’s absence / And
his pond fished by his next neighbour.’</p>
<p>Whatever the origin of Leontes’ suspicion, the dramatic interest is
in the effect, the tendency of human beings who have fallen into holes
to dig themselves ever deeper. No argument, not even the supposedly
divine ‘truth’ of the oracle, will convince Leontes of his error.
Accordingly, what does persuade him to change his mind is an effect of
emotion rather than reason: the shock, the raw grief, of his son’s and
wife’s sudden deaths. The boy Mamillius is the one who has said that ‘A
sad tale’s best for winter’ when his mother offers to tell him a story,
and he it is who becomes victim of the winterbound first half of the
play. Leontes metaphorically freezes his wife out of his affections,
with the unintended result that his son catches a literal chill and
dies. Only after this can the action move to the regenerative world of
romance. ‘Thou met’st with things dying, I with things newborn’, remarks
the Old Shepherd at the play’s pivotal point when he scoops up the baby
Perdita as Antigonus is torn to pieces by the bear.</p>
<p>One of the best ways of discovering Shakespeare’s core concerns in a
play is to consider his major additions to his sources: it is a fair
assumption that he is most himself when he departs from his originals.
As one would expect from Pandosto , Leontes is easily the largest role
in the play, twice as long as any other. But the next two most sizeable
parts – added together, they equal that of Leontes in length – are
Camillo and Paulina. The figure of Leontes’ honest counsellor greatly
expands the role of the king’s cupbearer in Pandosto, whilst Paulina,
Hermione’s preserver and Leontes’ conscience, has no equivalent in the
source. The prominence of these roles suggests that in this play
Shakespeare is especially interested in the relationship between
absolute power, with its potential to turn to tyranny, and the role of
the wise counsellor. How far can an adviser, or for that matter a
playwright whose works are performed at court, go in speaking truths
that their rulers might not want to hear? This was a perennial concern
in the Elizabethan and Jacobean era.</p>
<p>The court of King James was different from that of Queen Elizabeth
not least because there was a royal family. Negotiations to find the
right husband for the king’s daughter were ongoing at the time of the
play’s composition and first court performance. This should not,
however, lead us to read the drama as an allegory of contemporary
diplomacy. Leontes is in no sense a representation of King James;
besides, one of the things that makes the play a romance is its
delightful representation of paternal informality and intimacy in the
exchanges with Mamillius in the opening court scene. Real kings did not
publicly mix the roles of patriarch and playmate in this way.</p>
<p>In Greene’s Pandosto, when the Perdita figure arrives incognito at
court near the climax of the story, the desiring eye of her father falls
upon her, raising the spectre of royal incest. One of Paulina’s roles in
The Winter’s Tale is to divert Leontes from any thought of this kind:
‘Your eye hath too much youth in’t’, she remarks, reminding him that
even in middle age his dead queen was more beautiful ‘Than what you look
on now.’ Earlier in the same scene, Paulina has counselled the king
against remarriage, eliciting the response</p>
<p>Thou speak’st truth.</p>
<p>No more such wives: therefore, no wife. One worse,</p>
<p>And better used, would make her sainted spirit</p>
<p>Again possess her corpse, and on this stage —</p>
<p>Where we offenders now — appear soul-vexed,</p>
<p>And begin, ‘Why to me?’</p>
<p>These lines brilliantly anticipate the moment when, thanks to the
dramaturgical art of Paulina, the ‘sainted spirit’ of Hermione really
does appear to have a soul breathed back into it as she walks again on
that same ‘stage’.</p>
<p>In Pandosto the wronged queen does not return to life. The
reanimation of what Leontes takes to be Hermione’s statue is
Shakespeare’s invention. The wonder-filled final scene puts a seemingly
lifegiving art into the hands of Paulina. That art dramatizes the
magical power of theatre itself so that we in the audience, like the
characters on stage, awaken our faith. The many-layered quality of the
illusion – a boy-actor pretending to be a female character, Hermione,
who is herself pretending to be a statue – takes Shakespeare’s art to an
extreme level of self-consciousness. Fittingly, the scene is also an
allusion to Ovid, the most self-conscious artist among Shakespeare’s
literary models.</p>
<p>In book ten of the Metamorphoses, the artist Pygmalion carves an
ivory statue so realistic that it seems to be a real girl, so beautiful
that he falls in love with it. He desperately wants to believe it is
real and there are moments when the perfection of the art is such that
the statue does seem to be struggling into life. With a little
assistance from the goddess Venus, a kiss then animates the statue in a
striking reversal of the usual Ovidian metamorphic pattern in which
people are turned into things or animals. At a profound level, Pygmalion
is a figure of Ovid himself: the artist who transforms mere words into
living forms.</p>
<p>Shakespeare learned from Ovid’s Pygmalion both an idea and a style.
If you want something badly enough and you believe in it hard enough,
you will eventually get it: though tragedy denies this possibility,
comedy affirms it. This is the illusion that theatre can foster. Ovid
showed Shakespeare that the way to evoke this leap of faith is through
pinpricks of sensation. The progression in the animation of Pygmalion’s
statue is both precise and sensuous: blood pulses through the veins, the
lips respond, the ivory face flushes. Correspondingly, Leontes contrasts
the warm life his queen once had with the coldness of the statue, but
then he seems to see blood in the veins and warmth upon the lips. And
when she descends and embraces him, she is warm.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the play Leontes complains that Hermione’s
body-contact with Polixenes is ‘Too hot, too hot’ – he wants her to be
frigidly chaste, even though she is pregnant. His jealous look is like
that of the basilisk or the gorgon Medusa: he turns his wife to stone.
In the final act, this metaphor becomes a metamorphosis as Paulina
conjures up the illusion of Hermione’s depetrification. The
transformation is triumphantly realized on stage both linguistically and
visually. ‘Does not the stone rebuke me / For being more stone than it?’
asks Leontes, when confronted with the statue. The hardened image of his
wife forces him to turn his gaze inward upon his own hard heart. The
play ends with the melting of that heart and the rekindling of love,
with its concordant release of Hermione back into softness, warmth and
life.</p>
<p>We know in our heads that we are not really watching a statue coming
to life. Yet in a good production, at the moment of awakening we feel in
our hearts that we are. The magic of the drama occurs in a strange but
deeply satisfying space between the two poles of reality and illusion.
Metamorphosis is a kind of translation that occurs in the passage from
one state to another. Ovid’s world, which is also evoked by Perdita’s
comparison of herself to Proserpina, goddess of spring, shuttles between
human passions and natural phenomena. Shakespeare carried the magic of
that world across into the medium of theatre, where everything is
illusion, but somehow – as he put it in the alternative title of another
of his last plays, Henry VIII – ‘All is True.’</p>
<p>When Perdita, whose name means ‘lost one’, is restored to her father,
the oracle is fulfilled and there is some atonement for the death of
Mamillius. Not, however, full restoration, for Mamillius himself will
not return. The boy-actor who played the part would almost certainly
have doubled as Perdita in the second half of the play, visually
transforming the dead son into a living daughter. Polixenes’ son
Florizel also stands in for Mamillius: he grows into what Leontes’ son
might have become. When he and Perdita are joined in marriage, the two
kings and their kingdoms are united. Leontes has to accept that he will
only live on through the female line. This is an appropriate punishment,
given his earlier rejection of the female for having come between him
and his ‘brother’.</p>
<p>It will perhaps seem harsh to speak of punishment after the delights
of the pastoral scene, the benign mischief of Autolycus, and the wonder
of the moment when the supposed statue of Hermione is brought back to
life. To do so is to resemble the Paulina who browbeats Leontes into
maintaining his penance for sixteen years. When she finally softens and
lets him into her art gallery, surely we too need to let go of our
reason and our moral judgement. ‘It is required’, as Paulina puts it,
that we awake our faith. But can so much suffering evaporate in an
instant of theatrical magic? Hermione’s face is scarred with the marks
of time, the wrinkles accumulated in her sixteen years’ seclusion. And
not even the joys of the impending union of the two houses can bring
back the child whose ‘smutched’ nose his father has so tenderly wiped in
the first act.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Polixenes, King of Bohemia, has been on a nine-month visit to
the court of his childhood friend Leontes, King of Sicilia, and his
wife, Queen Hermione. Groundlessly, Leontes becomes convinced that his
heavily pregnant wife has been having an affair with Polixenes. He tries
to persuade his most trusted courtier, Camillo, to poison Polixenes.
Convinced of the queen’s innocence, Camillo warns Polixenes and they
depart for Bohemia together. Another courtier, Antigonus, is ordered to
leave Hermione’s newly born daughter on a desert shore. Leontes tries
Hermione for treason; when he denies the truth of the god Apollo’s
oracular declaration of her innocence, his son Mamillius dies. He is
then told that the queen has also died. Antigonus leaves the baby girl
on the coast of Bohemia, where he is torn to pieces by a bear. An old
shepherd and his clownish son find the baby, bring her up as a member of
their family and name her Perdita. Sixteen years later, she is being
courted by Polixenes’ son, Prince Florizel, who has disguised himself as
a shepherd, Doricles. The roguish pedlar Autolycus tricks the shepherds
out of money. Polixenes and Camillo come in disguise to the countryside;
when the king denounces his son for courting a low-born shepherdess,
Florizel and Perdita flee to Sicilia, with the assistance of Camillo.
The shepherd and clown follow, bringing tokens that reveal Perdita’s
true identity. That which was lost having been found, Paulina, the lady
most loyal to Hermione, reveals a statue of the dead queen and tells the
assembled company to prepare themselves for a great wonder.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentages of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Leontes (20％/125/6), Paulina (10％/59/5), Camillo (9％/72/5),
Autolycus (9％/67/3), Polixenes (8％/57/4), Florizel (6％/45/2),
Hermione (6％/35/4), Clown (5％/64/4), Shepherd (4％/42/3), Perdita
(4％/25/3), Antigonus (3％/19/3). An unusually large number of named
parts have 20–30 lines, less than 1％ of the text: Archidamus,
Cleomenes, Dion, the boy Mamillius, Emilia, Dorcas and Mopsa.</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 75％ verse, 25％ prose.</p>
<p>DATE: 1611. Performed at the Globe May 1611; dance of satyrs
apparently borrows from a court entertainment of January 1611; performed
at court November 1611 and again for royal wedding celebrations in early
1613. Some scholars argue for 1609–10 on assumption that satyrs’ dance
is a later interpolation, but theatres were closed because of plague for
many months of these earlier years.</p>
<p>SOURCES: A dramatization of Robert Greene’s prose romance, Pandosto:
The Triumph of Time (1588, also known as The History of Dorastus and
Fawnia ). The survival and revival of the queen is a Shakespearean
innovation, influenced by the story in Ovid’s Metamorphoses (book ten)
in which Pygmalion’s statue comes to life.</p>
<p>TEXT: First Folio of 1623 is only early printed text. Typeset from a
transcription by Ralph Crane, professional scribe to the King’s Men, it
is very well printed, with remarkably few textual problems.</p>
