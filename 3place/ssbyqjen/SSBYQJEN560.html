9</h4>
<p>Enter Othello and Emilia</p>
<p>OTHELLO You have seen nothing then?</p>
<p>EMILIA Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.</p>
<p>EMILIA But then I saw no harm, and then I heard</p>
<p>Each syllable that breath made up between them.</p>
<p>OTHELLO What, did they never whisper?</p>
<p>EMILIA Never, my lord.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Nor send you out o’th’way?</p>
<p>EMILIA Never.</p>
<p>OTHELLO To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?</p>
<p>EMILIA Never, my lord.</p>
<p>OTHELLO That’s strange.</p>
<p>EMILIA I durst 1401 , my lord, to wager she is honest,</p>
<p>Lay down my soul at stake 1402 : if you think other,</p>
<p>Remove your thought, it doth abuse your bosom:</p>
<p>If any wretch have put this in your head,</p>
<p>Let heaven requite it with the serpent’s curse 1403 !</p>
<p>For if she be not honest, chaste and true,</p>
<p>There’s no man happy: the purest of their wives</p>
<p>Is foul as slander.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Bid her come hither: go.</p>
<p>Exit Emilia</p>
<p>She says enough, yet she’s a simple bawd 1404</p>
<p>That cannot say as much. This 1405 is a subtle 1406 whore,</p>
<p>A closet lock and key 1407 of villainous secrets:</p>
<p>And yet she’ll kneel and pray, I have seen her do’t.</p>
<p>Enter Desdemona and Emilia</p>
<p>DESDEMONA My lord, what is your will?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Pray you, chuck, come hither.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA What is your pleasure?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Let me see your eyes: look in my face.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA What horrible fancy’s this?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Some of your function 1408 , mistress:</p>
<p>To Emilia</p>
<p>Leave procreants 1409 alone and shut the door:</p>
<p>Cough or cry ‘Hem’ if anybody come.</p>
<p>Your mystery 1410 , your mystery: nay, dispatch 1411 .</p>
<p>Exit Emilia</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Upon my knee, what doth your speech import?</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>I understand a fury in your words.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Why, what art thou?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Come, swear it, damn thyself</p>
<p>Lest, being like one of heaven 1412 , the devils themselves</p>
<p>Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damned:</p>
<p>Swear thou art honest.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Heaven doth truly know it.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA To whom, my lord? With whom? How am I false?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Ah Desdemon! Away, away, away!</p>
<p>Weeps</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Alas the heavy 1413 day! Why do you weep?</p>
<p>Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?</p>
<p>If haply 1414 you my father do suspect</p>
<p>An instrument of this your calling back,</p>
<p>Lay not your blame on me: if you have lost him,</p>
<p>I have lost him too.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Had it pleased heaven</p>
<p>To try me with affliction, had they rained</p>
<p>All kind of sores 1415 and shames on my bare head,</p>
<p>Steeped 1416 me in poverty to the very lips,</p>
<p>Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,</p>
<p>I should have found in some place of my soul</p>
<p>A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me</p>
<p>The fixèd figure 1417 for the time of scorn</p>
<p>To point his slow and moving finger 1418 at!</p>
<p>Yet could I bear that too, well, very well,</p>
<p>But there where I have garnered 1419 up my heart,</p>
<p>Where either I must live, or bear no life,</p>
<p>The fountain 1420 from the which my current runs</p>
<p>Or else dries up: to be discarded thence!</p>
<p>Or keep it as a cistern 1421 for foul toads</p>
<p>To knot and gender 1422 in! Turn thy complexion there 1423 ,</p>
<p>Patience, thou young and rose-lipped cherubin 1424 :</p>
<p>Ay, here look grim 1425 as hell!</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I hope my noble lord esteems me honest 1426 .</p>
<p>OTHELLO O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles 1427 ,</p>
<p>That quicken even with blowing 1428 . O, thou weed,</p>
<p>Who art so lovely fair and smell’st so sweet</p>
<p>That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst never been born!</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Alas, what ignorant 1429 sin have I committed 1430 ?</p>
<p>OTHELLO Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,</p>
<p>Made to write ‘whore’ upon? What committed?</p>
<p>Committed? O, thou public commoner 1431 ,</p>
<p>I should make very forges of my cheeks,</p>
<p>That would to cinders burn up modesty,</p>
<p>Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed?</p>
<p>Heaven stops 1432 the nose at it and the moon 1433 winks 1434 ,</p>
<p>The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets</p>
<p>Is hushed within the hollow mine 1435 of earth</p>
<p>And will not hear’t. What committed?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA By heaven, you do me wrong.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Are not you a strumpet 1436 ?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA No, as I am a Christian:</p>
<p>If to preserve this vessel 1437 for my lord</p>
<p>From any other foul unlawful touch</p>
<p>Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.</p>
<p>OTHELLO What, not a whore?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA No, as I shall be saved.</p>
<p>OTHELLO Is’t possible?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA O, heaven forgive us!</p>
<p>OTHELLO I cry you 1438 mercy, then:</p>
<p>I took you for that cunning whore of Venice</p>
<p>That married with Othello.— You, mistress,</p>
<p>Calls</p>
<p>Enter Emilia</p>
<p>That have the office opposite 1439 to Saint Peter 1440</p>
<p>And keeps the gate of hell 1441 ! You, you, ay, you!</p>
<p>We have done our course 1442 : there’s money for your pains.</p>
<p>I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel 1443 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Gives money</p>
<p>EMILIA Alas, what does this gentleman conceive 1444 ?</p>
<p>How do you, madam? How do you, my good lady?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Faith, half asleep 1445 .</p>
<p>EMILIA Good madam, what’s the matter with my lord?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA With who?</p>
<p>EMILIA Why, with my lord, madam.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Who is thy lord?</p>
<p>EMILIA He that is yours, sweet lady.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia:</p>
<p>I cannot weep, nor answers have I none</p>
<p>But what should go by water 1446 . Prithee, tonight</p>
<p>Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember,</p>
<p>And call thy husband hither.</p>
<p>EMILIA Here’s a change indeed!</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>DESDEMONA ’Tis meet 1447 I should be used 1448 so, very meet.</p>
<p>How have I been behaved, that he might stick</p>
<p>The small’st opinion on my least misuse? 1449</p>
<p>Enter Iago and Emilia</p>
<p>IAGO What is your pleasure, madam?</p>
<p>How is’t with you?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes</p>
<p>Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:</p>
<p>He might have chid me so, for, in good faith,</p>
<p>I am a child to chiding 1450 .</p>
<p>IAGO What’s the matter, lady?</p>
<p>EMILIA Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her 1451 ,</p>
<p>Thrown such despite 1452 and heavy 1453 terms upon her,</p>
<p>That true hearts cannot bear it.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Am I that name, Iago?</p>
<p>IAGO What name, fair lady?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Such as she said my lord did say I was.</p>
<p>EMILIA He called her whore: a beggar in his drink</p>
<p>Could not have laid such terms upon his callet 1454 .</p>
<p>IAGO Why did he so?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA I do not know: I am sure I am none such.</p>
<p>Weeps</p>
<p>IAGO Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!</p>
<p>EMILIA Hath she forsook 1455 so many noble matches?</p>
<p>Her father? And her country? And her friends?</p>
<p>To be called whore? Would it not make one weep?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA It is my wretched fortune.</p>
<p>IAGO Beshrew 1456 him for’t!</p>
<p>How comes this trick 1457 upon him?</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Nay, heaven doth know.</p>
<p>EMILIA I will be hanged if some eternal villain,</p>
<p>Some busy and insinuating rogue,</p>
<p>Some cogging 1458 , cozening 1459 slave, to get some office,</p>
<p>Have not devised this slander: I will be hanged else.</p>
<p>IAGO Fie, there is no such man: it is impossible.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA If any such there be, heaven pardon him!</p>
<p>EMILIA A halter 1460 pardon him! And hell gnaw his bones!</p>
<p>Why should he call her whore? Who keeps her company?</p>
<p>What place? What time? What form 1461 ? What likelihood?</p>
<p>The Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave,</p>
<p>Some base notorious knave, some scurvy 1462 fellow.</p>
<p>O heavens, that such companions 1463 thou’dst unfold 1464 ,</p>
<p>And put in every honest hand a whip</p>
<p>To lash the rascals naked through the world</p>
<p>Even from the east to th’west!</p>
<p>IAGO Speak within door 1465 .</p>
<p>EMILIA O, fie upon them! Some such squire 1466 he was</p>
<p>That turned your wit the seamy side without 1467</p>
<p>And made you to suspect me with the Moor.</p>
<p>IAGO You are a fool: go to.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA Alas, Iago,</p>
<p>What shall I do to win my lord again?</p>
<p>Good friend, go to him, for, by this light of heaven,</p>
<p>I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>If e’er my will did trespass gainst his love,</p>
<p>Either in discourse 1468 of thought or actual deed,</p>
<p>Or that 1469 mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense</p>
<p>Delighted them, or any other form,</p>
<p>Or that I do not yet 1470 , and ever did,</p>
<p>And ever will — though he do shake me off</p>
<p>To beggarly divorcement — love him dearly,</p>
<p>Comfort forswear 1471 me! Unkindness may do much,</p>
<p>And his unkindness may defeat my life,</p>
<p>But never taint my love. I cannot say ‘whore’:</p>
<p>It does abhor 1472 me now I speak the word:</p>
<p>To do the act that might the addition 1473 earn</p>
<p>Not the world’s mass of vanity 1474 could make me.</p>
<p>IAGO I pray you be content: ’tis but his humour 1475 .</p>
<p>The business of the state does him offence.</p>
<p>DESDEMONA If ’twere no other—</p>
<p>IAGO It is but so, I warrant.</p>
<p>Trumpets within</p>
<p>Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!</p>
<p>The messengers of Venice stays 1476 the meat 1477 :</p>
<p>Go in, and weep not: all things shall be well.</p>
<p>Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia</p>
<p>Enter Rodorigo</p>
<p>How now, Rodorigo?</p>
<p>RODORIGO I do not find that thou deal’st justly with me.</p>
<p>IAGO What in the contrary?</p>
<p>RODORIGO Every day thou daff’st me 1478 with some device 1479 , Iago,
and rather, as it seems to me now, keep’st from me all conveniency 1480
than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no
longer endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up 1481 in peace what
already I have foolishly suffered.</p>
<p>IAGO Will you hear me, Rodorigo?</p>
<p>RODORIGO I have heard too much, and your words and performances are
no kin together.</p>
<p>IAGO You charge me most unjustly.</p>
<p>RODORIGO With naught but truth: I have wasted myself out of my means.
The jewels you have had from me to deliver Desdemona would half have
corrupted a votarist 1482 : you have told me she hath received them and
returned me expectations and comforts 1483 of sudden respect 1484 and
acquaintance 1485 , but I find none.</p>
<p>IAGO Well, go to, very well.</p>
<p>RODORIGO ‘Very well’! ‘Go to’! I cannot go to 1486 , man, nor ’tis
not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin to find myself
fopped 1487 in it.</p>
<p>IAGO Very well.</p>
<p>RODORIGO I tell you ’tis not very well. I will make myself known to
Desdemona: if she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and
repent my unlawful solicitation: if not, assure yourself I will seek
satisfaction 1488 of you.</p>
<p>IAGO You have said 1489 now.</p>
<p>RODORIGO Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment 1490 of
doing.</p>
<p>IAGO Why, now I see there’s mettle 1491 in thee, and even from this
instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy
hand, Rodorigo: thou hast taken against me a most just exception 1492 ,
but yet I protest I have dealt most directly 1493 in thy affair.</p>
<p>RODORIGO It hath not appeared.</p>
<p>IAGO I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not
without wit and judgement. But, Rodorigo, if thou hast that in thee
indeed which I have greater reason to believe now than ever — I mean
purpose, courage and valour — this night show it: if thou the next night
following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery
and devise engines 1494 for my life.</p>
<p>RODORIGO Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass 1495 ?</p>
<p>IAGO Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
Cassio in Othello’s place.</p>
<p>RODORIGO Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to
Venice.</p>
<p>IAGO O, no. He goes into Mauritania 1496 and taketh away with him the
fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered 1497 here by some accident,
wherein none can be so determinate 1498 as the removing of Cassio.</p>
<p>RODORIGO How do you mean, removing him?</p>
<p>IAGO Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place: knocking out
his brains.</p>
<p>RODORIGO And that you would have me to do?</p>
<p>IAGO Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups
tonight with a harlotry 1499 , and thither will I go to him. He knows
not yet of his honourable fortune: if you will watch his going thence —
which I will fashion to fall out 1500 between twelve and one — you may
take him at your pleasure. I will be near to second 1501 your attempt,
and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed 1502 at it, but go
along with me: I will show you such a necessity in his death that you
shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high 1503
suppertime, and the night grows to waste 1504 : about it.</p>
<p>RODORIGO I will hear further reason for this.</p>
<p>IAGO And you shall be satisfied.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
