<h4 id="scene-1-2-running-scene-1">Scene 1 2 ／running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter King Richard, John of Gaunt 3 , with other Nobles and
Attendants</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Old John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster,</p>
<p>Hast thou 4 according to thy oath and band 5</p>
<p>Brought hither Henry Hereford 6 thy bold son,</p>
<p>Here to make good the boist’rous 7 late 8 appeal 9 ,</p>
<p>Which then our 10 leisure 11 would not let us hear,</p>
<p>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</p>
<p>GAUNT I have, my liege 12 .</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded 13 him,</p>
<p>If he appeal the duke on ancient 14 malice,</p>
<p>Or worthily, as a good subject should,</p>
<p>On some known ground 15 of treachery in him?</p>
<p>GAUNT As near as I could sift 16 him on that argument 17 ,</p>
<p>On some apparent 18 danger seen in him</p>
<p>Aimed at your highness, no inveterate 19 malice.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Then call them to our presence.</p>
<p>[Exit an Attendant ]</p>
<p>Face to face,</p>
<p>And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear</p>
<p>Th’accuser and the accusèd freely speak;</p>
<p>High-stomached 20 are they both, and full of ire 21 ,</p>
<p>In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</p>
<p>Enter Bullingbrook and Mowbray</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Many years of happy days befall</p>
<p>My gracious 22 sovereign, my most loving liege!</p>
<p>MOWBRAY Each day still 23 better other’s happiness</p>
<p>Until the heavens, envying earth’s good hap 24 ,</p>
<p>Add an immortal title 25 to your crown!</p>
<p>KING RICHARD We thank you both. Yet one but 26 flatters us,</p>
<p>As well appeareth 27 by the cause you come 28 ,</p>
<p>Namely, to appeal 29 each other of high treason.</p>
<p>Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object 30</p>
<p>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK First, heaven be the record 31 to my speech!</p>
<p>In the devotion of a subject’s love,</p>
<p>Tend’ring 32 the precious safety of my prince,</p>
<p>And free from other misbegotten 33 hate,</p>
<p>Come I appellant 34 to this princely presence.</p>
<p>Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,</p>
<p>And mark 35 my greeting well, for what I speak</p>
<p>My body shall make good upon this earth,</p>
<p>Or my divine soul answer 36 it in heaven.</p>
<p>Thou art a traitor and a miscreant 37 ;</p>
<p>Too good 38 to be so and too bad to live,</p>
<p>Since the more fair and crystal 39 is the sky,</p>
<p>The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</p>
<p>Once more, the more to aggravate 40 the note 41 ,</p>
<p>With a foul traitor’s name stuff I thy throat;</p>
<p>And wish —— so please my sovereign —— ere 42 I move,</p>
<p>What my tongue speaks my right 43 drawn sword may prove.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY Let not my cold 44 words here accuse 45 my zeal 46 :</p>
<p>’Tis not the trial 47 of a woman’s war,</p>
<p>The bitter clamour of two eager 48 tongues,</p>
<p>Can arbitrate 49 this cause 50 betwixt 51 us twain 52 .</p>
<p>The blood 53 is hot that must be cooled 54 for this.</p>
<p>Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</p>
<p>As to be hushed and nought at all to say.</p>
<p>First, the fair reverence of 55 your highness curbs me</p>
<p>From giving reins and spurs to my free speech,</p>
<p>Which else 56 would post 57 until it had returned</p>
<p>These terms of treason doubly down his throat.</p>
<p>Setting aside his high blood’s royalty 58 ,</p>
<p>And let 59 him be no kinsman to my liege,</p>
<p>I do defy 60 him, and I spit at him,</p>
<p>Call him a slanderous coward and a villain,</p>
<p>Which to maintain I would allow him odds 61 ,</p>
<p>And meet 62 him, were I tied 63 to run afoot</p>
<p>Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,</p>
<p>Or any other ground inhabitable 64</p>
<p>Wherever Englishman durst 65 set his foot.</p>
<p>Meantime, let this 66 defend my loyalty:</p>
<p>By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage 67 ,</p>
<p>Throws down his gage</p>
<p>Disclaiming here the kindred of a king,</p>
<p>And lay aside my high blood’s royalty,</p>
<p>Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except 68 .</p>
<p>If guilty dread hath left thee so much strength</p>
<p>As to take up mine honour’s pawn 69 , then stoop.</p>
<p>By that and all the rites of knighthood else,</p>
<p>Will I make good 70 against thee, arm to arm,</p>
<p>What I have spoken, or thou canst devise 71 .</p>
<p>MOWBRAY I take it up, and by that sword I swear</p>
<p>Takes up gage</p>
<p>Which gently 72 laid my knighthood on my shoulder,</p>
<p>I’ll answer thee in any fair degree 73 ,</p>
<p>Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:</p>
<p>And when I mount, alive may I not light 74 ,</p>
<p>If I be traitor or unjustly 75 fight!</p>
<p>KING RICHARD What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray’s charge 76 ?</p>
<p>It must be great that can inherit us 77</p>
<p>So much as of a thought of ill in him.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK Look 78 what I said: my life shall prove it true,</p>
<p>That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles 79</p>
<p>In name of lendings 80 for your highness’ soldiers,</p>
<p>The which he hath detained for lewd 81 employments,</p>
<p>Like a false traitor and injurious 82 villain.</p>
<p>Besides I say, and will in battle prove,</p>
<p>Or 83 here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</p>
<p>That ever was surveyed by English eye,</p>
<p>That all the treasons for these eighteen years</p>
<p>Complotted 84 and contrivèd in this land</p>
<p>Fetched 85 from false Mowbray their first head 86 and spring.</p>
<p>Further I say, and further will maintain</p>
<p>Upon his bad life to make all this good,</p>
<p>That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester 87 ’s death,</p>
<p>Suggest 88 his soon-believing adversaries,</p>
<p>And consequently, like a traitor coward,</p>
<p>Sluiced out 89 his innocent soul through streams of blood:</p>
<p>Which blood, like sacrificing 90 Abel 91 ’s, cries</p>
<p>Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth</p>
<p>To me for justice and rough chastisement 92 .</p>
<p>And by the glorious worth of my descent,</p>
<p>This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD How high a pitch 93 his resolution soars!</p>
<p>Thomas of Norfolk, what sayest thou to this?</p>
<p>MOWBRAY O, let my sovereign turn away his face</p>
<p>And bid his ears a little while be deaf,</p>
<p>Till I have told this slander of 94 his blood,</p>
<p>How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears.</p>
<p>Were he my brother, nay, our kingdom’s heir,</p>
<p>As he is but my father’s brother’s son,</p>
<p>Now, by my sceptre’s awe 95 , I make a vow,</p>
<p>Such neighbour 96 nearness to our sacred blood</p>
<p>Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize 97</p>
<p>The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.</p>
<p>He is our subject, Mowbray, so art thou.</p>
<p>Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY Then, Bullingbrook, as low as to thy heart,</p>
<p>Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.</p>
<p>Three parts of that receipt 98 I had for Calais</p>
<p>Disbursed I duly to his highness’ soldiers;</p>
<p>The other part reserved I by consent,</p>
<p>For that my sovereign liege was in my debt</p>
<p>Upon remainder of a dear account 99 ,</p>
<p>Since last I went to France to fetch 100 his queen.</p>
<p>Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester’s death,</p>
<p>I slew him not; but to mine own disgrace</p>
<p>Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</p>
<p>For you, my noble lord of Lancaster 101 ,</p>
<p>The honourable father to my foe,</p>
<p>Once I did lay an ambush for your life ——</p>
<p>A trespass 102 that doth vex my grievèd soul.</p>
<p>But ere I last received the sacrament</p>
<p>I did confess it, and exactly 103 begged</p>
<p>Your grace’s pardon, and I hope I had it.</p>
<p>This is my fault. As for the rest appealed 104 ,</p>
<p>It issues from the rancour of a villain,</p>
<p>A recreant 105 and most degenerate traitor</p>
<p>Which 106 in myself I boldly will defend,</p>
<p>And interchangeably 107 hurl down my gage</p>
<p>Throws down his gage</p>
<p>Upon this overweening 108 traitor’s foot,</p>
<p>To prove myself a loyal gentleman</p>
<p>Even in 109 the best blood chambered 110 in his bosom.</p>
<p>In haste whereof 111 , most heartily I pray</p>
<p>Your highness to assign our trial day.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me:</p>
<p>Let’s purge 112 this choler 113 without letting 114 blood.</p>
<p>This we prescribe, though no physician:</p>
<p>Deep malice makes too deep incision.</p>
<p>Forget, forgive, conclude 115 and be agreed:</p>
<p>Our doctors 116 say this is no time to bleed.</p>
<p>Good uncle, let this end where it begun:</p>
<p>We’ll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.</p>
<p>GAUNT To be a make-peace shall become 117 my age:</p>
<p>Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk’s gage.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD And, Norfolk, throw down his.</p>
<p>GAUNT When, Harry, when?</p>
<p>Obedience bids I should not bid again.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot 118 .</p>
<p>MOWBRAY Myself I throw, dread 119 sovereign, at thy foot.</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:</p>
<p>The one my duty owes, but my fair name 120 ,</p>
<p>Despite of death that lives upon my grave,</p>
<p>To dark dishonour’s use thou shalt not have.</p>
<p>I am disgraced, impeached 121 and baffled 122 here,</p>
<p>Pierced to the soul with slander’s venomed spear,</p>
<p>The which no balm 123 can cure but his heart-blood</p>
<p>Which breathed 124 this poison.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Rage must be withstood.</p>
<p>Give me his gage. Lions make leopards 125 tame.</p>
<p>MOWBRAY Yea, but not change his spots 126 . Take 127 but my
shame,</p>
<p>And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,</p>
<p>The purest treasure mortal times afford</p>
<p>Is spotless reputation: that away 128 ,</p>
<p>Men are but gilded 129 loam 130 or painted clay.</p>
<p>A jewel in a ten-times-barred-up 131 chest 132</p>
<p>Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.</p>
<p>Mine honour is my life; both grow in one 133 :</p>
<p>Take honour from me, and my life is done.</p>
<p>Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try 134 .</p>
<p>In that I live and for that will I die.</p>
<p>KING RICHARD Cousin, throw down your gage. Do you begin.</p>
<p>BULLINGBROOK O, heaven defend my soul from such foul sin!</p>
<p>Shall I seem crest-fall’n 135 in my father’s sight?</p>
<p>Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height 136</p>
<p>Before this out-dared 137 dastard 138 ? Ere my tongue</p>
<p>Shall wound mine honour with such feeble wrong,</p>
<p>Or sound so base a parle 139 , my teeth shall tear</p>
<p>The slavish motive 140 of recanting 141 fear,</p>
<p>And spit it bleeding in his 142 high disgrace,</p>
<p>Where shame doth harbour 143 , even in Mowbray’s face.</p>
<p>Exit Gaunt</p>
<p>KING RICHARD We were not born to sue 144 , but to command,</p>
<p>Which since we cannot do to make you friends,</p>
<p>Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,</p>
<p>At Coventry upon Saint Lambert’s day 145 :</p>
<p>There shall your swords and lances arbitrate</p>
<p>The swelling 146 difference of your settled 147 hate.</p>
<p>Since we cannot atone 148 you, we shall see</p>
<p>Justice design 149 the victor’s chivalry 150 .</p>
<p>Lord Marshal, command our officers at arms</p>
<p>Be ready to direct these home alarms 151 .</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
