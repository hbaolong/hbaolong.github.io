<h4 id="scene-2-406-running-scene-5">Scene 2 406 / running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter the Clown 407 [Lancelet 408 ] alone</p>
<p>LANCELET Certainly my conscience will serve 409 me to run from this
Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me,
‘Gobbo 410 , Lancelet Gobbo, good Lancelet’, or ‘Good Gobbo’, or ‘Good
Lancelet Gobbo, use your legs, take the start 411 , run away.’ My
conscience says, ‘No; take heed, honest Lancelet, take heed, honest
Gobbo’, or, as aforesaid, ‘Honest Lancelet Gobbo, do not run, scorn
running with thy heels 412 .’ Well, the most courageous 413 fiend bids
me pack 414 : ‘Fia! 415’ says the fiend, ‘Away!’ says the fiend, ‘For
the heavens 416 , rouse up a brave mind’, says the fiend, ‘and run.’
Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very
wisely to me, ‘My honest 417 friend Lancelet, being an honest man’s
son’, or rather an honest woman’s son — for indeed my father did
something 418 smack 419 , something grow to 420 , he had a kind of taste
421 — well, my conscience says ‘Lancelet, budge not.’ ‘Budge’, says the
fiend. ‘Budge not’, says my conscience. ‘Conscience,’ say I, ‘you
counsel well.’ ‘Fiend,’ say I, ‘you counsel well.’ To be ruled by my
conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who, God bless the
mark 422 , is a kind of devil; and to run away from the Jew, I should be
ruled by the fiend, who, saving your reverence 423 , is the devil
himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation 424 , and in my
conscience, my conscience is a kind of hard conscience to offer to
counsel me to stay with the Jew; the fiend gives the more friendly
counsel. I will run, fiend. My heels are at your commandment. I will
run.</p>
<p>Enter Old Gobbo, with a basket</p>
<p>GOBBO Master young man, you, I pray you which is the way to Master
Jew’s?</p>
<p>LANCELET O heavens, this is my true-begotten 425 father, who, being
more than sand-blind 426 , high-gravel-blind 427 , knows me not. I will
try confusions 428 with him.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>GOBBO Master young gentleman, I pray you which is the way to Master
Jew’s?</p>
<p>LANCELET Turn upon your right hand at the next turning, but at the
next turning of all, on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn
of no hand 429 , but turn down indirectly 430 to the Jew’s house.</p>
<p>GOBBO By God’s sonties 431 , ’twill be a hard way to hit 432 . Can
you tell me whether one Lancelet, that dwells with him, dwell with him
or no?</p>
<p>LANCELET Talk you of young Master Lancelet?— Mark me now, now will I
raise the waters 433 .— Talk you of young Master Lancelet?</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>GOBBO No master 434 , sir, but a poor man’s son. His father, though I
say’t, is an honest exceeding poor man and, God be thanked, well to live
435 .</p>
<p>LANCELET Well, let his father be what a 436 will, we talk of young
Master Lancelet.</p>
<p>GOBBO Your worship’s friend and Lancelet 437 .</p>
<p>LANCELET But I pray you ergo 438 , old man, ergo , I beseech you talk
you of young Master Lancelet?</p>
<p>GOBBO Of Lancelet, an’t 439 please your mastership.</p>
<p>LANCELET Ergo , Master Lancelet. Talk not of Master Lancelet, father
440 , for the young gentleman — according to fates and destinies and
such odd sayings, the Sisters Three 441 and such branches of learning —
is indeed deceased, or as you would say in plain terms, gone to
heaven.</p>
<p>GOBBO Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my
very prop.</p>
<p>LANCELET Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post 442 , a staff or a
prop? Do you know me, father?</p>
<p>GOBBO Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman, but I pray you
tell me, is my boy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?</p>
<p>LANCELET Do you not know me, father?</p>
<p>GOBBO Alack, sir, I am sand-blind. I know you not.</p>
<p>LANCELET Nay, indeed if you had your eyes you might fail of the
knowing 443 me: it is a wise father that knows his own child 444 . Well,
old man, I will tell you news of your son. Give me your blessing. Truth
will come to light, murder cannot be 445 hid long, a man’s son may, but
in the end truth will out.</p>
<p>He kneels</p>
<p>GOBBO Pray you, sir, stand up. I am sure you are not Lancelet, my
boy.</p>
<p>LANCELET Pray you let’s have no more fooling about it, but give me
your blessing. I am Lancelet, your boy that was, your son that is, your
child that shall be.</p>
<p>GOBBO I cannot think you are my son.</p>
<p>LANCELET I know not what I shall think of that. But I am Lancelet,
the Jew’s man, and I am sure Margery 446 your wife is my mother.</p>
<p>GOBBO Her name is Margery, indeed. I’ll be sworn, if thou be
Lancelet, thou art mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipped might he
be! What a beard hast thou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
Dobbin my fill-horse 447 has on his tail.</p>
<p>LANCELET It should seem, then, that Dobbin’s tail grows backward 448
. I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of 449 my face when
I last saw him.</p>
<p>He rises</p>
<p>GOBBO Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy master agree
450 ? I have brought him a present. How ’gree you now?</p>
<p>LANCELET Well, well. But for mine own part, as I have set up my rest
451 to run away, so I will not rest 452 till I have run some ground; my
master’s a very 453 Jew. Give him a present? Give him a halter 454 ! I
am famished in his service. You may tell 455 every finger I have with my
ribs 456 . Father, I am glad you are come. Give me 457 your present to
one Master Bassanio, who, indeed, gives rare 458 new liveries 459 . If I
serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare fortune!
Here comes the man. To him, father, for I am a Jew 460 if I serve the
Jew any longer.</p>
<p>Enter Bassanio, with a follower or two [including Leonardo ]</p>
<p>BASSANIO You may do so, but let it be so hasted 461 that supper be
ready at the farthest 462 by five of the clock. See these letters
delivered, put the liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to come anon
463 to my lodging.</p>
<p>To a Servant</p>
<p>[Exit a Servant ]</p>
<p>LANCELET To him, father.</p>
<p>GOBBO God bless your worship!</p>
<p>Comes forward</p>
<p>BASSANIO Gramercy 464 ! Wouldst thou aught 465 with me?</p>
<p>GOBBO Here’s my son, sir, a poor 466 boy—</p>
<p>LANCELET Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew’s man, that would,
sir, as my father shall specify—</p>
<p>GOBBO He hath a great infection 467 , sir, as one would say, to
serve—</p>
<p>LANCELET Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew and have
a desire, as my father shall specify—</p>
<p>GOBBO His master and he, saving your worship’s reverence, are scarce
468 cater-cousins 469 —</p>
<p>LANCELET To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me
wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I hope, an old man, shall
frutify 470 unto you—</p>
<p>GOBBO I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your
worship, and my suit is—</p>
<p>LANCELET In very brief, the suit is impertinent 471 to myself, as
your worship shall know by this honest old man, and though I say it,
though old man, yet poor man, my father.</p>
<p>BASSANIO One speak for both. What would you?</p>
<p>LANCELET Serve you, sir.</p>
<p>GOBBO That is the very defect 472 of the matter, sir.</p>
<p>BASSANIO I know thee well, thou hast obtained thy suit.</p>
<p>Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,</p>
<p>And hath preferred 473 thee, if it be preferment</p>
<p>To leave a rich Jew’s service, to become</p>
<p>The follower of so poor a gentleman.</p>
<p>LANCELET The old proverb 474 is very well parted 475 between my
master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of God, sir, and he hath
enough.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Thou speak’st it well. Go, father, with thy son.</p>
<p>Take leave of thy old master and inquire</p>
<p>My lodging out 476 .— Give him a livery</p>
<p>To a Servant</p>
<p>More guarded 477 than his fellows’. See it done.</p>
<p>LANCELET Father, in. I cannot get a service, no. I have ne’er a
tongue in my head. Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table 478
which doth offer to swear upon a book 479 , I shall have good fortune.
Go to, here’s a simple 480 line of life 481 , here’s a small trifle 482
of wives. Alas, fifteen wives is nothing! Eleven widows and nine maids
is a simple 483 coming-in 484 for one man, and then to scape 485
drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a
feather-bed 486 . Here are simple scapes 487 . Well, if Fortune be a
woman, she’s a good wench for this gear 488 . Father, come; I’ll take my
leave of the 489 Jew in the twinkling.</p>
<p>Points to his palm</p>
<p>Exit Clown [Lancelet with Old Gobbo ]</p>
<p>BASSANIO I pray thee good Leonardo, think on this.</p>
<p>Gives a list</p>
<p>These things being bought and orderly bestowed 490 ,</p>
<p>Return in haste, for I do feast 491 tonight</p>
<p>My best-esteemed acquaintance. Hie thee, go.</p>
<p>LEONARDO My best endeavours shall be done herein 492 .</p>
<p>Enter Gratiano</p>
<p>GRATIANO Where’s your master?</p>
<p>LEONARDO Yonder, sir, he walks.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>GRATIANO Signior Bassanio!</p>
<p>BASSANIO Gratiano!</p>
<p>GRATIANO I have a suit to you.</p>
<p>BASSANIO You have obtained it 493 .</p>
<p>GRATIANO You must not deny me. I must go with you to Belmont.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano,</p>
<p>Thou art too wild, too rude 494 and bold of voice,</p>
<p>Parts 495 that become 496 thee happily enough</p>
<p>And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;</p>
<p>But where they are not known, why, there they show 497</p>
<p>Something too liberal 498 . Pray thee take pain 499</p>
<p>To allay 500 with some cold drops of modesty 501</p>
<p>Thy skipping 502 spirit, lest through thy wild behaviour</p>
<p>I be misconstered 503 in the place I go to,</p>
<p>And lose my hopes.</p>
<p>GRATIANO Signior Bassanio, hear me:</p>
<p>If I do not put on a sober habit 504 ,</p>
<p>Talk with respect and swear but 505 now and then,</p>
<p>Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,</p>
<p>Nay more, while grace is saying 506 , hood mine eyes</p>
<p>Thus with my hat, and sigh and say ‘Amen’,</p>
<p>Covers his face</p>
<p>Use all the observance of civility,</p>
<p>Like one well studied in a sad ostent 507</p>
<p>To please his grandam 508 , never trust me more.</p>
<p>BASSANIO Well, we shall see your bearing.</p>
<p>GRATIANO Nay, but I bar 509 tonight. You shall not gauge 510 me</p>
<p>By what we do tonight.</p>
<p>BASSANIO No, that were pity.</p>
<p>I would entreat you rather to put on</p>
<p>Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends</p>
<p>That purpose 511 merriment. But fare you well.</p>
<p>I have some business.</p>
<p>GRATIANO And I must to Lorenzo and the rest,</p>
<p>But we will visit you at suppertime.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
