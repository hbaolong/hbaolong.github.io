<h4 id="scene-1-running-scene-5">Scene 1 ／ running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter Angelo, Escalus, Servants, [and a ] Justice</p>
<p>ANGELO We must not make a scarecrow of the law,</p>
<p>Setting it up to fear 290 the birds of prey,</p>
<p>And let it keep one shape, till custom 291 make it</p>
<p>Their perch and not their terror.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Ay, but yet</p>
<p>Let us be keen 292 , and rather cut a little 293</p>
<p>Than fall 294 and bruise 295 to death. Alas, this gentleman</p>
<p>Whom I would save had a most noble father.</p>
<p>Let but your honour know —</p>
<p>Whom I believe to be most strait 296 in virtue —</p>
<p>That, in the working of your own affections 297 ,</p>
<p>Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,</p>
<p>Or that the resolute acting of your blood</p>
<p>Could have attained th’effect of your own purpose 298 ,</p>
<p>Whether you had not sometime in your life</p>
<p>Erred in this point which 299 now you censure him,</p>
<p>And pulled the law upon you.</p>
<p>ANGELO ’Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,</p>
<p>Another thing to fall. I not deny,</p>
<p>The jury passing 300 on the prisoner’s life,</p>
<p>May in the sworn twelve 301 have a thief or two</p>
<p>Guiltier than him they try. What’s open made 302 to justice,</p>
<p>That justice seizes. What 303 knows the laws</p>
<p>That thieves do pass on thieves? ’Tis very pregnant 304 ,</p>
<p>The jewel that we find, we stoop and take’t</p>
<p>Because we see it, but what we do not see</p>
<p>We tread upon, and never think of it.</p>
<p>You may not so extenuate 305 his offence</p>
<p>For 306 I have had such faults, but rather tell me,</p>
<p>When I, that censure him, do so offend,</p>
<p>Let mine own judgement pattern out 307 my death,</p>
<p>And nothing come in partial 308 . Sir, he must die.</p>
<p>Enter Provost</p>
<p>ESCALUS Be it as your wisdom will.</p>
<p>ANGELO Where is the provost?</p>
<p>PROVOST Here, if it like 309 your honour.</p>
<p>ANGELO See that Claudio</p>
<p>Be executed by nine tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared 310 ,</p>
<p>For that’s the utmost of his pilgrimage 311 .</p>
<p>[Exit Provost ]</p>
<p>ESCALUS Well, heaven forgive him, and forgive us all.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall.</p>
<p>Some run from breaks of ice 312 , and answer none 313 ,</p>
<p>And some condemnèd for a fault alone 314 .</p>
<p>Enter Elbow [and ] Officers [with ] Froth 315 [and ] Clown [Pompey
]</p>
<p>ELBOW Come, bring them away: if these be good people in a commonweal
that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses 316 , I know no
law. Bring them away.</p>
<p>ANGELO How now, sir, what’s your name? And what’s the matter?</p>
<p>ELBOW If it please your honour, I am the poor duke’s 317 constable,
and my name is Elbow: I do lean 318 upon justice, sir, and do bring in
here before your good honour two notorious benefactors 319 .</p>
<p>ANGELO Benefactors? Well, what benefactors are they? Are they not
malefactors?</p>
<p>ELBOW If it please your honour, I know not well what they are, but
precise 320 villains they are, that I am sure of, and void 321 of all
profanation 322 in the world that good Christians ought to have.</p>
<p>ESCALUS This comes off well 323 : here’s a wise officer.</p>
<p>To Angelo</p>
<p>ANGELO Go to 324 , what quality 325 are they of? Elbow is your name?
Why dost thou not speak, Elbow?</p>
<p>POMPEY He cannot, sir: he’s out at elbow 326 .</p>
<p>ANGELO What are you, sir?</p>
<p>ELBOW He, sir? A tapster, sir, parcel-bawd 327 , one that serves 328
a bad woman, whose house 329 , sir, was, as they say, plucked down in
the suburbs: and now she professes 330 a hot-house 331 , which, I think,
is a very ill house too.</p>
<p>ESCALUS How know you that?</p>
<p>ELBOW My wife, sir, whom I detest 332 before heaven and your
honour—</p>
<p>ESCALUS How? Thy wife?</p>
<p>ELBOW Ay, sir: whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman—</p>
<p>ESCALUS Dost thou detest her therefore?</p>
<p>ELBOW I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she, that
this house, if it be not a bawd’s house, it is pity of her life 333 ,
for it is a naughty 334 house.</p>
<p>ESCALUS How dost thou know that, constable?</p>
<p>ELBOW Marry, sir, by my wife, who, if she had been a woman cardinally
335 given, might have been accused in fornication, adultery and all
uncleanliness 336 there.</p>
<p>ESCALUS By the woman’s means 337 ?</p>
<p>ELBOW Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone’s means: but as she spit in his
338 face, so she defied him.</p>
<p>POMPEY Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.</p>
<p>ELBOW Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable 339 man,
prove it.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Do you hear how he misplaces 340 ?</p>
<p>Aside to Angelo</p>
<p>POMPEY Sir, she came in great with child, and longing — saving your
honour’s reverence 341 — for stewed prunes 342 . Sir, we had but two in
the house, which at that very distant 343 time stood 344 , as it were,
in a fruit-dish 345 , a dish of some three-pence — your honours have
seen such dishes, they are not China dishes, but very good dishes—</p>
<p>ESCALUS Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.</p>
<p>POMPEY No, indeed, sir, not of a pin 346 : you are therein in the
right. But to the point 347 . As I say, this Mistress Elbow, being, as I
say, with child, and being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
prunes, and having but two in the dish, as I said, Master Froth here,
this very man, having eaten the rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying
for them very honestly, for, as you know, Master Froth, I could not give
you threepence again 348 .</p>
<p>FROTH No, indeed.</p>
<p>POMPEY Very well: you being then, if you be remembered, cracking the
stones 349 of the foresaid prunes—</p>
<p>FROTH Ay, so I did indeed.</p>
<p>POMPEY Why, very well: I telling you then, if you be remembered, that
such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of 350 ,
unless they kept very good diet, as I told you—</p>
<p>FROTH All this is true.</p>
<p>POMPEY Why, very well, then—</p>
<p>ESCALUS Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose: what was done
to Elbow’s wife, that he hath cause to complain of ? Come me 351 to what
was done 352 to her.</p>
<p>POMPEY Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.</p>
<p>ESCALUS No, sir, nor I mean it not.</p>
<p>POMPEY Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour’s leave. And, I
beseech you, look into 353 Master Froth here, sir, a man of fourscore
pound 354 a year, whose father died at Hallowmas 355 . Was’t not at
Hallowmas, Master Froth?</p>
<p>FROTH All-hallond eve 356 .</p>
<p>POMPEY Why, very well, I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as I
say, in a lower chair 357 , sir, ’twas in the Bunch of Grapes 358 ,
where indeed you have a delight to sit, have you not?</p>
<p>FROTH I have so, because it is an open 359 room and good for
winter.</p>
<p>POMPEY Why, very well, then. I hope here be truths.</p>
<p>ANGELO This will last out a night in Russia 360 ,</p>
<p>When nights are longest there. I’ll take my leave</p>
<p>And leave you to the hearing of the cause 361 ,</p>
<p>Hoping you’ll find good cause 362 to whip them all.</p>
<p>Exit [Angelo ]</p>
<p>ESCALUS I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.— Now, sir,
come on: what was done 363 to Elbow’s wife, once more?</p>
<p>POMPEY Once, sir? There was nothing done to her once.</p>
<p>ELBOW I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.</p>
<p>POMPEY I beseech your honour, ask me.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?</p>
<p>POMPEY I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman’s face. Good Master
Froth, look upon his honour, ’tis for a good purpose. Doth your honour
mark 364 his face?</p>
<p>ESCALUS Ay, sir, very well.</p>
<p>POMPEY Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Well, I do so.</p>
<p>POMPEY Doth your honour see any harm in his face?</p>
<p>ESCALUS Why, no.</p>
<p>POMPEY I’ll be supposed 365 upon a book 366 , his face is the worst
thing about him. Good, then, if his face be the worst thing about him,
how could Master Froth do the constable’s wife any harm 367 ? I would
know that of your honour.</p>
<p>ESCALUS He’s in the right. Constable, what say you to it?</p>
<p>ELBOW First, an it like 368 you, the house is a respected 369 house;
next, this is a respected 370 fellow, and his mistress is a respected
woman.</p>
<p>POMPEY By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than
any of us all.</p>
<p>ELBOW Varlet, thou liest, thou liest, wicked varlet! The time is yet
to come that she was ever respected with man, woman or child.</p>
<p>POMPEY Sir, she was respected with him before he married with
her.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity 371 ? Is this
true?</p>
<p>ELBOW O thou caitiff 372 ! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal 373
! I respected with her before I was married to her? If ever I was
respected with her, or she with me, let not your worship think me the
poor duke’s officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or I’ll have mine
action of battery 374 on thee.</p>
<p>ESCALUS If he took 375 you a box o’th’ear, you might have your action
of slander too.</p>
<p>ELBOW Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is’t your
worship’s pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?</p>
<p>ESCALUS Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that
thou wouldst discover 376 if thou couldst, let him continue in his
courses 377 till thou know’st what they are.</p>
<p>ELBOW Marry, I thank your worship for it.— Thou see’st, thou wicked
varlet, now, what’s come upon thee: thou art to continue 378 now, thou
varlet, thou art to continue.</p>
<p>To Pompey</p>
<p>ESCALUS Where were you born, friend?</p>
<p>FROTH Here in Vienna, sir.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Are you of fourscore pounds a year?</p>
<p>FROTH Yes, an’t 379 please you, sir.</p>
<p>ESCALUS So. What trade are you of, sir?</p>
<p>POMPEY A tapster, a poor widow’s tapster.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Your mistress’ name?</p>
<p>POMPEY Mistress Overdone.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Hath she had any more than one husband?</p>
<p>POMPEY Nine, sir: Overdone by the last 380 .</p>
<p>ESCALUS Nine? Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I would
not have you acquainted with tapsters: they will draw 381 you, Master
Froth, and you will hang them 382 . Get you gone, and let me hear no
more of you.</p>
<p>FROTH I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into any
room in a tap-house 383 , but 384 I am drawn in.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Well, no more of it, Master Froth, farewell.—</p>
<p>[Exit Froth ]</p>
<p>Come you hither to me, Master Tapster. What’s your name, Master
Tapster?</p>
<p>To Pompey</p>
<p>POMPEY Pompey.</p>
<p>ESCALUS What else?</p>
<p>POMPEY Bum, sir.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you, so that
in the beastliest 385 sense you are Pompey the Great 386 . Pompey, you
are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in 387 being a
tapster, are you not? Come, tell me true, it shall be the better for
you.</p>
<p>POMPEY Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live 388 .</p>
<p>ESCALUS How would you live, Pompey? By being a bawd? What do you
think of the trade, Pompey? Is it a lawful trade?</p>
<p>POMPEY If the law would allow it, sir.</p>
<p>ESCALUS But the law will not allow it, Pompey, nor it shall not be
allowed in Vienna.</p>
<p>POMPEY Does your worship mean to geld and splay 389 all the youth of
the city?</p>
<p>ESCALUS No, Pompey.</p>
<p>POMPEY Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to’t 390 then. If
your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves 391 , you need
not to fear 392 the bawds.</p>
<p>ESCALUS There is pretty orders 393 beginning, I can tell you: it is
but heading and hanging 394 .</p>
<p>POMPEY If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year
together, you’ll be glad to give out a commission for more heads 395 :
if this law hold 396 in Vienna ten year, I’ll rent the fairest house in
it after 397 three-pence a bay 398 . If you live to see this come to
pass, say Pompey told you so.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Thank you, good Pompey, and, in requital of 399 your
prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find you before me again
upon any complaint whatsoever, no, not for dwelling where you do. If I
do, Pompey, I shall beat you 400 to your tent, and prove a shrewd 401
Caesar to you: in plain dealing 402 , Pompey, I shall have you whipped.
So, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.</p>
<p>POMPEY I thank your worship for your good counsel— but I shall follow
it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine 403 .</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Whip me? No, no, let carman 404 whip his jade 405 :</p>
<p>The valiant heart’s not whipped out of his trade.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>ESCALUS Come hither to me, Master Elbow, come hither, Master
Constable. How long have you been in this place 406 of constable?</p>
<p>ELBOW Seven year and a half, sir.</p>
<p>ESCALUS I thought by the readiness 407 in the office you had
continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?</p>
<p>ELBOW And a half, sir.</p>
<p>ESCALUS Alas, it hath been great pains 408 to you. They do you wrong
to put you so oft upon’t 409 . Are there not men in your ward 410
sufficient 411 to serve it?</p>
<p>ELBOW Faith, sir, few of any wit 412 in such matters: as they are
chosen, they are glad to choose me for them. I do it for some piece of
money, and go through with all 413 .</p>
<p>ESCALUS Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven, the most
sufficient of your parish.</p>
<p>ELBOW To your worship’s house, sir?</p>
<p>ESCALUS To my house. Fare you well.</p>
<p>[Exit Elbow ]</p>
<p>What’s o’clock, think you?</p>
<p>To Justice</p>
<p>JUSTICE Eleven, sir.</p>
<p>ESCALUS I pray you home to dinner 414 with me.</p>
<p>JUSTICE I humbly thank you.</p>
<p>ESCALUS It grieves me for the death of Claudio,</p>
<p>But there’s no remedy.</p>
<p>JUSTICE Lord Angelo is severe.</p>
<p>ESCALUS It is but needful 415 .</p>
<p>Mercy is not itself that oft looks so,</p>
<p>Pardon is still the nurse of second woe 416 :</p>
<p>But yet, poor Claudio! There is no remedy.</p>
<p>Come, sir.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
