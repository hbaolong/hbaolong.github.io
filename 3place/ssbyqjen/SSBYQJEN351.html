<h4 id="scene-2-671-running-scene-6">Scene 2 671 / running scene 6</h4>
<p>Enter two Officers, to lay cushions, as it were, in the Capitol</p>
<p>FIRST OFFICER Come, come, they are almost here: how many stand for
consulships?</p>
<p>SECOND OFFICER Three, they say: but ’tis thought of 672 everyone
Coriolanus will carry it.</p>
<p>FIRST OFFICER That’s a brave 673 fellow: but he’s vengeance 674
proud, and loves not the common people.</p>
<p>SECOND OFFICER Faith, there hath been many great men that have
flattered the people, who ne’er loved them 675 : and there be many that
they 676 have loved, they know not wherefore 677 : so that if they love
they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground. Therefore, for
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the
true knowledge he has in 678 their disposition, and out of his noble
carelessness lets them plainly see’t.</p>
<p>FIRST OFFICER If he did not care whether he had their love or no, he
waved 679 indifferently ’twixt doing them neither good nor harm: but he
seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him, and
leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him 680 their opposite 681
. Now to seem to affect 682 the malice and displeasure of the people is
as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.</p>
<p>SECOND OFFICER He hath deserved worthily of his country, and his
ascent is not by such easy degrees 683 as those who, having been supple
684 and courteous to the people, bonneted 685 , without any further deed
to have them at all into their estimation and report 686 : but he hath
so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts
that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind
of ingrateful injury: to report otherwise were a malice that, giving
itself the lie 687 , would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that
heard it.</p>
<p>FIRST OFFICER No more of him: he’s a worthy man: make way, they are
coming.</p>
<p>A sennet. Enter the Patricians, and the Tribunes of the people
[Sicinius and Brutus ], Lictors 688 before them: Coriolanus, Menenius,
Cominius the consul. Sicinius and Brutus take their places by
themselves: Coriolanus stands</p>
<p>MENENIUS Having determined 689 of the Volsces and</p>
<p>To send for Titus Lartius, it remains</p>
<p>As the main point of this our after-meeting 690 ,</p>
<p>To gratify 691 his noble service that</p>
<p>Hath thus stood for 692 his country. Therefore please you,</p>
<p>Most reverend and grave 693 elders, to desire</p>
<p>The present consul and last general</p>
<p>In our well-found 694 successes to report</p>
<p>A little of that worthy work performed</p>
<p>By Martius Caius Coriolanus, whom</p>
<p>We met here both to thank and to remember</p>
<p>With honours like himself 695 .</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Speak, good Cominius:</p>
<p>Leave nothing out for length 696 , and make us think</p>
<p>Rather our state’s defective for requital 697</p>
<p>Than we to stretch it out.— Masters o’th’people,</p>
<p>To the Tribunes</p>
<p>We do request your kindest ears: and after 698</p>
<p>Your loving motion 699 toward the common body 700 ,</p>
<p>To yield 701 what passes here.</p>
<p>SICINIUS We are convented 702 upon 703 a pleasing treaty 704 , and
have hearts inclinable to honour and advance the theme 705 of our
assembly.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Which the rather we shall be blest 706 to do if he remember a
kinder value 707 of the people than he hath hereto 708 prized them
at.</p>
<p>MENENIUS That’s off 709 , that’s off. I would you rather had been
silent: please you to hear</p>
<p>Cominius speak?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Most willingly: but yet my caution was more pertinent than the
rebuke you give it.</p>
<p>MENENIUS He loves your people, but tie him not to be their bedfellow.
Worthy</p>
<p>Cominius, speak.</p>
<p>Coriolanus rises, and offers 710 to go away</p>
<p>Nay, keep your place.</p>
<p>To Coriolanus</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Sit, Coriolanus: never shame to hear</p>
<p>What you have nobly done.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Your honour’s pardon:</p>
<p>I had rather have my wounds to heal again</p>
<p>Than hear say how I got them.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Sir, I hope my words disbenched 711 you not?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS No, sir: yet oft,</p>
<p>When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.</p>
<p>You soothed 712 not, therefore hurt not: but your people,</p>
<p>I love them as they weigh 713 —</p>
<p>MENENIUS Pray now, sit down.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS I had rather have one scratch my head i’th’sun</p>
<p>When the alarum were struck 714 than idly sit</p>
<p>To hear my nothings monstered 715 .</p>
<p>Exit Coriolanus</p>
<p>MENENIUS Masters of the people,</p>
<p>Your multiplying spawn 716 how can he flatter —</p>
<p>That’s thousand to one 717 good one — when you now see</p>
<p>He had rather venture all his limbs for honour</p>
<p>Than one on’s 718 ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.</p>
<p>COMINIUS I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus</p>
<p>Should not be uttered feebly: it is held</p>
<p>That valour is the chiefest virtue, and</p>
<p>Most dignifies the haver: if it be,</p>
<p>The man I speak of cannot in the world</p>
<p>Be singly counterpoised 719 . At sixteen years,</p>
<p>When Tarquin made a head for 720 Rome, he fought</p>
<p>Beyond the mark 721 of others: our then dictator 722 ,</p>
<p>Whom with all praise I point at 723 , saw him fight,</p>
<p>When with his Amazonian 724 chin he drove</p>
<p>The bristled lips before him: he bestrid 725</p>
<p>An o’erpressed 726 Roman, and i’th’consul’s view 727</p>
<p>Slew three opposers: Tarquin’s self he met,</p>
<p>And struck him on 728 his knee: in that day’s feats,</p>
<p>When he might act the woman in the scene 729 ,</p>
<p>He proved best man i’th’field and for his meed 730</p>
<p>Was brow-bound with the oak 731 . His pupil age</p>
<p>Man-entered thus 732 , he waxèd 733 like a sea,</p>
<p>And in the brunt 734 of seventeen battles since</p>
<p>He lurched all swords of the garland 735 : for 736 this last,</p>
<p>Before and in Corioles, let me say</p>
<p>I cannot speak him home 737 : he stopped the fliers 738 ,</p>
<p>And by his rare 739 example made the coward</p>
<p>Turn terror into sport: as weeds before</p>
<p>A vessel under sail, so men obeyed</p>
<p>And fell below his stem 740 : his sword, death’s stamp 741 ,</p>
<p>Where it did mark, it took 742 : from face to foot</p>
<p>He was a thing of blood, whose every motion</p>
<p>Was timed 743 with dying cries: alone he entered</p>
<p>The mortal 744 gate of th’city, which 745 he, painted</p>
<p>With shunless 746 destiny 747 , aidless came off 748 ,</p>
<p>And with a sudden reinforcement 749 struck 750</p>
<p>Corioles like a planet: now all’s his:</p>
<p>When by and by the din of war gan 751 pierce</p>
<p>His ready sense 752 : then straight 753 his doubled 754 spirit</p>
<p>Requickened 755 what in flesh was fatigate 756 ,</p>
<p>And to the battle came he, where he did</p>
<p>Run reeking 757 o’er the lives of men, as if</p>
<p>’Twere a perpetual spoil 758 : and till we called</p>
<p>Both field and city ours, he never stood</p>
<p>To ease his breast with panting.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Worthy man.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR He cannot but with measure 759 fit the honours which we
devise him.</p>
<p>COMINIUS Our spoils he kicked at 760 ,</p>
<p>And looked upon things precious as 761 they were</p>
<p>The common muck of the world: he covets less</p>
<p>Than misery 762 itself would give, rewards</p>
<p>His deeds with doing them 763 , and is content</p>
<p>To spend the time to end it 764 .</p>
<p>MENENIUS He’s right noble: let him be called for.</p>
<p>FIRST SENATOR Call Coriolanus.</p>
<p>OFFICER He doth appear.</p>
<p>Enter Coriolanus</p>
<p>MENENIUS The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee
consul.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS I do owe them still 765 my life and services.</p>
<p>MENENIUS It then remains that you do speak to the people.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS I do beseech you,</p>
<p>Let me o’erleap that custom, for I cannot</p>
<p>Put on the gown, stand naked 766 , and entreat them,</p>
<p>For my wounds’ sake, to give their sufferage 767 :</p>
<p>Please you that I may pass 768 this doing.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Sir, the people must have their voices 769 :</p>
<p>Neither will they bate 770 one jot of ceremony.</p>
<p>MENENIUS Put 771 them not to’t:</p>
<p>Pray you, go fit you to the custom and</p>
<p>Take to you, as your predecessors have,</p>
<p>Your honour with your form 772 .</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS It is a part that I shall blush in acting,</p>
<p>And might well be taken from the people.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Mark you that?</p>
<p>To Sicinius</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS To brag unto them, ‘Thus I did, and thus’:</p>
<p>Show them th’unaching scars which I should hide,</p>
<p>As if I had received them for the hire 773</p>
<p>Of their breath only!</p>
<p>MENENIUS Do not stand upon’t 774 :</p>
<p>We recommend 775 to you, tribunes of the people,</p>
<p>Our purpose to them 776 , and to our noble consul</p>
<p>Wish we all joy and honour.</p>
<p>SENATORS To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!</p>
<p>Flourish [of ] cornets. Then exeunt [all but ] Sicinius and
Brutus</p>
<p>BRUTUS You see how he intends to use 777 the people.</p>
<p>SICINIUS May they perceive’s intent! He will require 778 them</p>
<p>As if he did contemn what he requested</p>
<p>Should be in them to give 779 .</p>
<p>BRUTUS Come, we’ll inform them</p>
<p>Of our proceedings here: on th’market-place</p>
<p>I know they do attend 780 us.</p>
<p>[Exeunt ]</p>
