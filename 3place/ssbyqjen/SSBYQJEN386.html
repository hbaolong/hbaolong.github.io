10</h4>
<p>Enter Tamora and her two sons [Demetrius and Chiron,] disguised</p>
<p>TAMORA Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment 895 ,</p>
<p>I will encounter with Andronicus</p>
<p>And say I am Revenge, sent from below</p>
<p>To join with him and right his heinous wrongs:</p>
<p>Knock at his study, where they say he keeps 896 ,</p>
<p>To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge:</p>
<p>Tell 897 him Revenge is come to join with him</p>
<p>And work confusion 898 on his enemies.</p>
<p>They knock and Titus opens his study door</p>
<p>Aloft or within 899 , holding papers</p>
<p>TITUS Who doth molest my contemplation?</p>
<p>Is it your trick to make me ope 900 the door,</p>
<p>That so my sad decrees 901 may fly away</p>
<p>And all my study be to no effect?</p>
<p>You are deceived, for what I mean to do</p>
<p>See here in bloody lines 902 I have set down,</p>
<p>And what is written shall be executed 903 .</p>
<p>TAMORA Titus, I am come to talk with thee.</p>
<p>TITUS No, not a word. How can I grace 904 my talk,</p>
<p>Wanting a hand to give it action 905 ?</p>
<p>Thou hast the odds of 906 me, therefore no more.</p>
<p>TAMORA If thou didst know me, thou would’st talk with me.</p>
<p>TITUS I am not mad, I know thee well enough:</p>
<p>Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines,</p>
<p>Witness these trenches 907 made by grief and care,</p>
<p>Witness the tiring day and heavy 908 night,</p>
<p>Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well</p>
<p>For our proud empress, mighty Tamora.</p>
<p>Is not thy coming for my other hand?</p>
<p>TAMORA Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora:</p>
<p>She is thy enemy and I thy friend.</p>
<p>I am Revenge, sent from th’infernal kingdom</p>
<p>To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind</p>
<p>By working wreakful 909 vengeance on thy foes.</p>
<p>Come down and welcome me to this world’s light,</p>
<p>Confer with me of murder and of death:</p>
<p>There’s not a hollow cave or lurking place,</p>
<p>No vast obscurity or misty vale</p>
<p>Where bloody murder or detested rape</p>
<p>Can couch 910 for fear, but I will find them out,</p>
<p>And in their ears tell them my dreadful 911 name,</p>
<p>Revenge, which makes the foul offenders quake.</p>
<p>TITUS Art thou Revenge? And art thou sent to me</p>
<p>To be a torment to mine enemies?</p>
<p>TAMORA I am: therefore come down and welcome me.</p>
<p>TITUS Do me some service ere I come to thee.</p>
<p>Lo by thy side where Rape and Murder stands:</p>
<p>Now give some surance 912 that thou art Revenge:</p>
<p>Stab them or tear them on thy chariot-wheels,</p>
<p>And then I’ll come and be thy wagoner,</p>
<p>And whirl along with thee about the globes 913 ,</p>
<p>Provide thee two proper palfreys 914 , as black as jet,</p>
<p>To hale 915 thy vengeful wagon swift away,</p>
<p>And find out murder 916 in their guilty caves.</p>
<p>And when thy car 917 is loaden with their heads,</p>
<p>I will dismount and by the wagon wheel</p>
<p>Trot like a servile footman all day long,</p>
<p>Even from Hyperion 918 ’s rising in the east</p>
<p>Until his very downfall 919 in the sea.</p>
<p>And day by day I’ll do this heavy task,</p>
<p>So 920 thou destroy Rapine 921 and Murder there.</p>
<p>TAMORA These are my ministers, and come with me.</p>
<p>TITUS Are these thy ministers? What are they called?</p>
<p>TAMORA Rape and Murder, therefore callèd so,</p>
<p>Cause they take vengeance of 922 such kind of men.</p>
<p>TITUS Good Lord, how like the empress’ sons they are,</p>
<p>And you the empress! But we worldly 923 men</p>
<p>Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.</p>
<p>O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee,</p>
<p>And if one arm’s embracement will content thee,</p>
<p>I will embrace thee in it by and by.</p>
<p>[Exit aloft or within ]</p>
<p>TAMORA This closing 924 with him fits his lunacy:</p>
<p>Whate’er I forge 925 to feed his brainsick fits,</p>
<p>Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,</p>
<p>For now he firmly takes me for Revenge,</p>
<p>And, being credulous in this mad thought,</p>
<p>I’ll make him send for Lucius his son,</p>
<p>And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure 926 ,</p>
<p>I’ll find some cunning practice 927 out of hand 928</p>
<p>To scatter and disperse the giddy 929 Goths,</p>
<p>Or at the least make them his enemies.</p>
<p>See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme 930 .</p>
<p>[Enter Titus, on main stage]</p>
<p>TITUS Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee.</p>
<p>Welcome, dread Fury 931 , to my woeful house:</p>
<p>Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.</p>
<p>How like the empress and her sons you are!</p>
<p>Well are you fitted 932 , had you but a Moor:</p>
<p>Could not all hell afford you such a devil?</p>
<p>For well I wot the empress never wags 933</p>
<p>But in her company there is a Moor,</p>
<p>And, would you represent our queen aright</p>
<p>It were convenient 934 you had such a devil.</p>
<p>But welcome as you are. What shall we do?</p>
<p>TAMORA What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Show me a murderer, I’ll deal with 935 him.</p>
<p>CHIRON Show me a villain that hath done a rape,</p>
<p>And I am sent to be revenged on him.</p>
<p>TAMORA Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,</p>
<p>And I’ll be revengèd on them all.</p>
<p>TITUS Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,</p>
<p>To Demetrius</p>
<p>And when thou find’st a man that’s like thyself,</p>
<p>Good Murder, stab him: he’s a murderer.—</p>
<p>Go thou with him, and when it is thy hap 936</p>
<p>To Chiron</p>
<p>To find another that is like to thee,</p>
<p>Good Rapine, stab him: he is a ravisher.—</p>
<p>Go thou with them, and in the emperor’s court</p>
<p>To Tamora</p>
<p>There is a queen, attended by a Moor —</p>
<p>Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion 937 ,</p>
<p>For up and down 938 she doth resemble thee —</p>
<p>I pray thee do on them some violent death:</p>
<p>They have been violent to me and mine.</p>
<p>TAMORA Well hast thou lessoned us: this shall we do.</p>
<p>But would it please thee, good Andronicus,</p>
<p>To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,</p>
<p>Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,</p>
<p>And bid him come and banquet at thy house?</p>
<p>When he is here, even at thy solemn 939 feast,</p>
<p>I will bring in the empress and her sons,</p>
<p>The emperor himself and all thy foes,</p>
<p>And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel,</p>
<p>And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.</p>
<p>What says Andronicus to this device?</p>
<p>Enter Marcus</p>
<p>TITUS Marcus, my brother! ’Tis sad Titus calls.</p>
<p>Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius —</p>
<p>Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths —</p>
<p>Bid him repair 940 to me and bring with him</p>
<p>Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths.</p>
<p>Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:</p>
<p>Tell him the emperor and the empress too</p>
<p>Feasts at my house, and he shall feast with them.</p>
<p>This do thou for my love, and so let him,</p>
<p>As he regards his agèd father’s life.</p>
<p>MARCUS This will I do, and soon return again.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>TAMORA Now will I hence about thy business,</p>
<p>And take my ministers along with me.</p>
<p>TITUS Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me,</p>
<p>Or else I’ll call my brother back again,</p>
<p>And cleave to no revenge but Lucius 941 .</p>
<p>TAMORA What say you, boys? Will you bide with him</p>
<p>Aside to her sons</p>
<p>Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor</p>
<p>How I have governed our determined jest 942 ?</p>
<p>Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair 943 ,</p>
<p>And tarry with him till I turn 944 again.</p>
<p>TITUS I know them all, though they suppose me mad,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>And will o’erreach them in their own devices:</p>
<p>A pair of cursèd hell-hounds and their dam!</p>
<p>DEMETRIUS Madam, depart at pleasure, leave us here.</p>
<p>TAMORA Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes</p>
<p>To lay a complot to betray thy foes.</p>
<p>TITUS I know thou dost, and, sweet Revenge, farewell.</p>
<p>[Exit Tamora ]</p>
<p>CHIRON Tell us, old man, how shall we be employed?</p>
<p>TITUS Tut, I have work enough for you to do.—</p>
<p>Publius, come hither.— Caius and Valentine!</p>
<p>[Enter Publius, Caius and Valentine]</p>
<p>PUBLIUS What is your will?</p>
<p>TITUS Know you these two?</p>
<p>PUBLIUS The empress’ sons, I take them: Chiron, Demetrius.</p>
<p>TITUS Fie, Publius, fie, thou art too much deceived:</p>
<p>The one is Murder, Rape is the other’s name,</p>
<p>And therefore bind them, gentle Publius.</p>
<p>Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.</p>
<p>Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,</p>
<p>And now I find it: therefore bind them sure,</p>
<p>They seize Chiron and Demetrius</p>
<p>And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry 945 .</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>CHIRON Villains, forbear 946 ! We are the empress’ sons.</p>
<p>PUBLIUS And therefore 947 do we what we are commanded.</p>
<p>Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.</p>
<p>Is he sure bound? Look that you bind them fast.</p>
<p>Enter Titus Andronicus with a knife, and Lavinia with a basin</p>
<p>TITUS Come, come, Lavinia: look, thy foes are bound.</p>
<p>Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me,</p>
<p>But let them hear what fearful words I utter.</p>
<p>O villains, Chiron and Demetrius,</p>
<p>Here stands the spring 948 whom you have stained with mud,</p>
<p>This goodly summer with your winter mixed.</p>
<p>You killed her husband, and for that vile fault</p>
<p>Two of her brothers were condemned to death,</p>
<p>My hand cut off and made a merry jest,</p>
<p>Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear</p>
<p>Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,</p>
<p>Inhuman traitors, you constrained and forced.</p>
<p>What would you say if I should let you speak?</p>
<p>Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.</p>
<p>Hark, wretches, how I mean to martyr 949 you.</p>
<p>This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,</p>
<p>Whilst that Lavinia ’tween her stumps doth hold</p>
<p>The basin that receives your guilty blood.</p>
<p>You know your mother means to feast with me,</p>
<p>And calls herself Revenge and thinks me mad:</p>
<p>Hark, villains, I will grind your bones to dust</p>
<p>And with your blood and it I’ll make a paste 950 ,</p>
<p>And of the paste a coffin 951 I will rear</p>
<p>And make two pasties 952 of your shameful heads,</p>
<p>And bid that strumpet 953 , your unhallowed 954 dam,</p>
<p>Like to the earth swallow her own increase 955 .</p>
<p>This is the feast that I have bid her to,</p>
<p>And this the banquet she shall surfeit 956 on:</p>
<p>For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,</p>
<p>And worse than Progne 957 I will be revenged.</p>
<p>And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,</p>
<p>Receive the blood, and when that they are dead,</p>
<p>Let me go grind their bones to powder small</p>
<p>And with this hateful liquor temper 958 it,</p>
<p>And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.</p>
<p>Come, come, be everyone officious 959</p>
<p>To make this banquet, which I wish might prove</p>
<p>More stern and bloody than the Centaurs’ feast 960 .</p>
<p>He cuts their throats</p>
<p>So, now bring them in, for I’ll play the cook,</p>
<p>And see them ready gainst 961 their mother comes.</p>
<p>Exeunt [with the bodies ]</p>
