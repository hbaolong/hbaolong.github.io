<h4 id="scene-1-3-running-scene-1">Scene 1 3 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter young Bertram, [the ] Count of Rossillion, his mother [the
Countess ], and Helena, Lord Lafew, all in black</p>
<p>COUNTESS In delivering 4 my son from me, I bury a second husband.</p>
<p>BERTRAM And I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew; but
I must attend 5 his majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward 6 ,
evermore in subjection 7 .</p>
<p>LAFEW You shall find of 8 the king a husband 9 , madam, you, sir, a
father. He that so generally 10 is at all times good must of necessity
hold 11 his virtue 12 to you, whose 13 worthiness would stir it up where
it wanted 14 rather than lack it where there is such abundance 15 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS What hope is there of his majesty’s amendment 16 ?</p>
<p>LAFEW He hath abandoned his physicians, madam, under whose practices
17 he hath persecuted time 18 with hope, and finds no other advantage in
the process but only the losing of hope by time.</p>
<p>COUNTESS This young gentlewoman had a father — O, that ‘had’! How sad
a passage 19 ’tis! — whose skill was almost as great as his honesty 20 ,
had it stretched so far, would have made nature immortal, and death
should have play for lack of work. Would 21 for the king’s sake he were
living! I think it would be the death of the king’s disease.</p>
<p>LAFEW How called you the man you speak of, madam?</p>
<p>COUNTESS He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great
right to be so: Gerard de Narbon 22 .</p>
<p>LAFEW He was excellent indeed, madam. The king very lately spoke of
him admiringly and mourningly: he was skilful enough to have lived still
23 , if knowledge could be set up against mortality.</p>
<p>BERTRAM What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?</p>
<p>LAFEW A fistula 24 , my lord.</p>
<p>BERTRAM I heard not of it before.</p>
<p>LAFEW I would it were not notorious 25 . Was this gentlewoman the
daughter of Gerard de Narbon?</p>
<p>COUNTESS His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking 26
. I have those hopes of her good 27 that her education 28 promises her
dispositions 29 she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer. For where
an unclean 30 mind carries virtuous qualities 31 , there commendations
go with pity 32 , they are virtues and traitors too. In her they are the
better for their simpleness 33 ; she derives 34 her honesty and achieves
her goodness.</p>
<p>LAFEW Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.</p>
<p>COUNTESS ’Tis the best brine a maiden can season 35 her praise in.
The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny
of her sorrows takes all livelihood 36 from her cheek. No more of this,
Helena. Go to 37 , no more, lest it be rather thought you affect 38 than
to have 39 a sorrow than to have.</p>
<p>HELEN I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.</p>
<p>LAFEW Moderate lamentation is the right of 40 the dead, excessive
grief the enemy to the living.</p>
<p>COUNTESS If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it
soon mortal 41 .</p>
<p>BERTRAM Madam, I desire your holy 42 wishes.</p>
<p>LAFEW How understand we that? 43</p>
<p>COUNTESS Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father</p>
<p>In manners 44 as in shape 45 . Thy 46 blood 47 and virtue</p>
<p>Contend for empire 48 in thee, and thy goodness</p>
<p>Share with thy birthright 49 . Love all, trust a few,</p>
<p>Do wrong to none. Be able 50 for thine enemy</p>
<p>Rather in power 51 than use, and keep thy friend</p>
<p>Under thy own life’s key 52 . Be checked 53 for silence,</p>
<p>But never taxed 54 for speech. What 55 heaven more will 56 ,</p>
<p>That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck 57 down,</p>
<p>Fall on thy head! Farewell.— My lord,</p>
<p>To Lafew</p>
<p>’Tis an unseasoned 58 courtier. Good my lord,</p>
<p>Advise him.</p>
<p>LAFEW He cannot want 59 the best 60</p>
<p>That shall attend his love 61 .</p>
<p>COUNTESS Heaven bless him.— Farewell, Bertram.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>BERTRAM The best wishes that can be forged 62 in your thoughts be
servants to you! Be comfortable 63 to my mother, your mistress, and make
much of 64 her.</p>
<p>To Helen</p>
<p>LAFEW Farewell, pretty lady. You must hold 65 the credit 66 of your
father.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Bertram and Lafew ]</p>
<p>HELEN O, were that all! I think not on my father,</p>
<p>And these great tears grace his remembrance more</p>
<p>Than those I shed for him 67 . What was he like?</p>
<p>I have forgot him. My imagination</p>
<p>Carries no favour 68 in’t but Bertram’s.</p>
<p>I am undone 69 . There is no living, none,</p>
<p>If Bertram be away. ’Twere all one</p>
<p>That 70 I should love a bright particular star</p>
<p>And think to wed it, he is so above me.</p>
<p>In his bright radiance and collateral 71 light</p>
<p>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere 72 ;</p>
<p>Th’ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</p>
<p>The hind 73 that would be mated by the lion</p>
<p>Must die for love. ’Twas pretty 74 , though a plague,</p>
<p>To see him every hour, to sit and draw</p>
<p>His archèd brows, his hawking 75 eye, his curls</p>
<p>In our heart’s table 76 — heart too capable 77</p>
<p>Of every line and trick 78 of his sweet favour 79 :</p>
<p>But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy 80</p>
<p>Must sanctify his relics 81 . Who comes here?</p>
<p>Enter Parolles 82</p>
<p>One that goes with him: I love him for his 83 sake,</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>And yet I know him a notorious liar,</p>
<p>Think him a great way 84 fool, solely 85 a coward.</p>
<p>Yet these fixed 86 evils sit so fit 87 in him</p>
<p>That they take place 88 when virtue’s steely 89 bones</p>
<p>Looks bleak i’th’cold wind 90 . Withal 91 , full oft 92 we see</p>
<p>Cold wisdom waiting on 93 superfluous 94 folly.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Save 95 you, fair queen 96 !</p>
<p>HELEN And you, monarch!</p>
<p>PAROLLES No.</p>
<p>HELEN And no.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Are you meditating on virginity?</p>
<p>HELEN Ay. You have some stain 97 of soldier in you. Let me ask you a
question. Man is enemy to virginity: how may we barricado 98 it against
him?</p>
<p>PAROLLES Keep 99 him out.</p>
<p>HELEN But he assails, and our virginity, though valiant, in the
defence yet is weak. Unfold 100 to us some warlike resistance.</p>
<p>PAROLLES There is none. Man setting down before you 101 will
undermine 102 you and blow you up 103 .</p>
<p>HELEN Bless 104 our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up!
Is there no military policy 105 how virgins might blow up men?</p>
<p>PAROLLES Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up
106 . Marry 107 , in blowing him down 108 again, with the breach 109
yourselves made, you lose your city 110 . It is not politic 111 in the
commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is
rational increase 112 , and there was never virgin got 113 till
virginity was first lost. That 114 you were made of is mettle 115 to
make virgins. Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found 116 .
By being ever kept, it is ever lost. ’Tis too cold 117 a companion. Away
with’t!</p>
<p>HELEN I will stand for’t 118 a little, though therefore I die a
virgin.</p>
<p>PAROLLES There’s little can be said in’t 119 , ’tis against the rule
of nature. To speak on the part 120 of virginity is to accuse your
mothers, which is most infallible 121 disobedience. He that hangs
himself is a virgin 122 : virginity murders itself and should be buried
in highways out of all sanctified limit 123 , as a desperate 124
offendress 125 against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a
cheese, consumes itself to the very paring 126 , and so dies with
feeding his 127 own stomach 128 . Besides, virginity is peevish 129 ,
proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited 130 sin in
the canon 131 . Keep it not, you cannot choose but lose 132 by’t. Out
with’t! 133 Within ten year it will make itself two 134 , which is a
goodly increase, and the principal 135 itself not much the worse. Away
with’t!</p>
<p>HELEN How 136 might one do, sir, to lose it 137 to her own
liking?</p>
<p>PAROLLES Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it likes.
’Tis a commodity will lose the gloss 138 with lying 139 : the longer
kept, the less worth. Off with’t while ’tis vendible 140 . Answer the
time of request 141 . Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
of fashion: richly suited 142 but unsuitable 143 , just like the brooch
and the toothpick 144 , which wear not 145 now. Your date 146 is better
in your pie 147 and your porridge 148 than in your cheek 149 . And your
virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French withered pears
150 : it looks ill, it eats dryly 151 . Marry, ’tis a withered pear: it
was formerly better: marry, yet ’tis a withered pear. Will you anything
with it?</p>
<p>HELEN Not my virginity yet —</p>
<p>There 152 shall your master have a thousand loves,</p>
<p>A mother 153 and a mistress and a friend,</p>
<p>A phoenix 154 , captain and an enemy,</p>
<p>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</p>
<p>A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear.</p>
<p>His humble ambition, proud humility,</p>
<p>His jarring concord 155 , and his discord dulcet 156 ,</p>
<p>His faith, his sweet disaster 157 . With a world</p>
<p>Of pretty, fond 158 , adoptious 159 christendoms 160</p>
<p>That blinking 161 Cupid gossips 162 . Now shall he —</p>
<p>I know not what he shall. God send him well 163 !</p>
<p>The court’s a learning place, and he is one—</p>
<p>PAROLLES What one, i’faith?</p>
<p>HELEN That I wish well. ’Tis pity—</p>
<p>PAROLLES What’s pity?</p>
<p>HELEN That wishing well had not a body 164 in’t,</p>
<p>Which might be felt, that we, the poorer born,</p>
<p>Whose baser stars 165 do shut us up in 166 wishes,</p>
<p>Might with effects of them 167 follow our friends,</p>
<p>And show what we alone must think 168 , which never</p>
<p>Returns us thanks 169 .</p>
<p>Enter Page</p>
<p>PAGE Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>PAROLLES Little Helen, farewell. If I can remember thee, I will think
of thee at court.</p>
<p>HELEN Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Under Mars 170 , ay 171 .</p>
<p>HELEN I especially think, under 172 Mars.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Why under Mars?</p>
<p>HELEN The wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born
under Mars.</p>
<p>PAROLLES When he was predominant 173 .</p>
<p>HELEN When he was retrograde 174 , I think rather.</p>
<p>PAROLLES Why think you so?</p>
<p>HELEN You go so much backward 175 when you fight.</p>
<p>PAROLLES That’s for advantage 176 .</p>
<p>HELEN So is running away, when fear proposes the safety. But the
composition 177 that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a
good wing 178 , and I like the wear 179 well.</p>
<p>PAROLLES I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee acutely. I
will return perfect 180 courtier in the which 181 , my instruction shall
serve to naturalize 182 thee, so thou wilt be capable of 183 a
courtier’s counsel and understand what advice shall thrust 184 upon
thee. Else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes
thee away 185 . Farewell. When thou hast leisure 186 , say thy prayers.
When thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband, and
use 187 him as he uses thee. So, farewell.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>HELEN Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,</p>
<p>Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated 188 sky</p>
<p>Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull</p>
<p>Our slow designs 189 when we ourselves are dull 190 .</p>
<p>What power is it which mounts my love so high,</p>
<p>That makes me see, and cannot feed 191 mine eye?</p>
<p>The 192 mightiest space in fortune 193 nature brings</p>
<p>To join like likes 194 and kiss like native 195 things.</p>
<p>Impossible be strange attempts 196 to those</p>
<p>That weigh their pains in sense 197 and do suppose</p>
<p>What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove</p>
<p>To show her merit that did miss 198 her love?</p>
<p>The king’s disease — my project may deceive me,</p>
<p>But my intents are fixed and will not leave me.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
