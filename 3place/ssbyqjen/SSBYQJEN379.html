<h4 id="scene-1-464-running-scene-4">Scene 1 464 / running scene 4</h4>
<p>Enter the Judges and Senators with Titus’ two sons [Martius and
Quintus] bound, passing on the stage to the place of execution, and
Titus going before, pleading</p>
<p>TITUS Hear me, grave fathers 465 ! Noble tribunes, stay!</p>
<p>For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent</p>
<p>In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept,</p>
<p>For all my blood 466 in Rome’s great quarrel 467 shed,</p>
<p>For all the frosty nights that I have watched 468 ,</p>
<p>And for these bitter tears which now you see</p>
<p>Filling the agèd wrinkles in my cheeks,</p>
<p>Be pitiful to my condemnèd sons,</p>
<p>Whose souls is not corrupted as ’tis thought.</p>
<p>For two and twenty sons I never wept,</p>
<p>Because they died in honour’s lofty bed.</p>
<p>Andronicus lieth down and the Judges pass by him</p>
<p>For these, two tribunes, in the dust I write</p>
<p>My heart’s deep languor 469 and my soul’s sad tears:</p>
<p>Let my tears stanch 470 the earth’s dry appetite,</p>
<p>My sons’ sweet blood will make it shame 471 and blush.</p>
<p>Exeunt . [Titus remains ]</p>
<p>O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain</p>
<p>That shall distil 472 from these two ancient ruins 473</p>
<p>Than youthful April shall with all his showers.</p>
<p>In summer’s drought I’ll drop upon thee still 474 :</p>
<p>In winter with warm tears I’ll melt the snow</p>
<p>And keep eternal springtime on thy face,</p>
<p>So 475 thou refuse to drink my dear sons’ blood.</p>
<p>Enter Lucius, with his weapon drawn</p>
<p>O reverend tribunes, O gentle, agèd men,</p>
<p>Unbind my sons, reverse the doom 476 of death,</p>
<p>And let me say, that never wept before,</p>
<p>My tears are now prevailing orators 477 .</p>
<p>LUCIUS O noble father, you lament in vain:</p>
<p>The tribunes hear you not, no man is by,</p>
<p>And you recount your sorrows to a stone.</p>
<p>TITUS Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.</p>
<p>Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you—</p>
<p>LUCIUS My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.</p>
<p>TITUS Why, tis no matter, man: if they did hear,</p>
<p>They would not mark 478 me, or if they did mark,</p>
<p>They would not pity me.</p>
<p>Therefore I tell my sorrows bootless 479 to the stones,</p>
<p>Who, though they cannot answer my distress,</p>
<p>Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes</p>
<p>For that they will not intercept 480 my tale:</p>
<p>When I do weep, they humbly at my feet</p>
<p>Receive my tears and seem to weep with me,</p>
<p>And were they but attirèd 481 in grave 482 weeds 483 ,</p>
<p>Rome could afford 484 no tribune like to these.</p>
<p>A stone is as soft wax, tribunes more hard than stones:</p>
<p>A stone is silent, and offendeth not,</p>
<p>And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.</p>
<p>But wherefore stand’st thou with thy weapon drawn?</p>
<p>Rises</p>
<p>LUCIUS To rescue my two brothers from their death,</p>
<p>For which attempt the judges have pronounced</p>
<p>My everlasting doom of banishment.</p>
<p>TITUS O happy 485 man, they have befriended thee.</p>
<p>Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive</p>
<p>That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?</p>
<p>Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey</p>
<p>But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,</p>
<p>From these devourers to be banishèd!</p>
<p>But who comes with our brother Marcus here?</p>
<p>Enter Marcus and Lavinia</p>
<p>MARCUS Titus, prepare thy noble eyes to weep,</p>
<p>Or if not so, thy noble heart to break:</p>
<p>I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.</p>
<p>TITUS Will it consume me? Let me see it then.</p>
<p>MARCUS This was thy daughter.</p>
<p>TITUS Why, Marcus, so she is.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Ay me, this object 486 kills me.</p>
<p>Falls to his knees</p>
<p>TITUS Faint-hearted boy, arise and look upon her.—</p>
<p>Lucius rises</p>
<p>Speak, Lavinia, what accursèd hand</p>
<p>Hath made thee handless in thy father’s sight?</p>
<p>What fool hath added water to the sea?</p>
<p>Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?</p>
<p>My grief was at the height before thou cam’st,</p>
<p>And now like Nilus 487 it disdaineth 488 bounds.</p>
<p>Give me a sword, I’ll chop off my hands too,</p>
<p>For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain:</p>
<p>And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life 489 :</p>
<p>In bootless prayer have they been held up,</p>
<p>And they have served me to effectless 490 use:</p>
<p>Now all the service I require of them</p>
<p>Is that the one will help to cut the other.</p>
<p>’Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,</p>
<p>For hands to do Rome service is but vain.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Speak, gentle sister: who hath martyred 491 thee?</p>
<p>MARCUS O, that delightful engine 492 of her thoughts</p>
<p>That blabbed 493 them with such pleasing eloquence,</p>
<p>Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage</p>
<p>Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung</p>
<p>Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!</p>
<p>LUCIUS O, say thou for her: who hath done this deed?</p>
<p>MARCUS O, thus I found her, straying in the park 494 ,</p>
<p>Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer</p>
<p>That hath received some unrecuring 495 wound.</p>
<p>TITUS It was my dear 496 , and he that wounded her</p>
<p>Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead,</p>
<p>For now I stand as one upon a rock</p>
<p>Environed 497 with a wilderness of sea,</p>
<p>Who marks the waxing 498 tide grow wave by wave,</p>
<p>Expecting ever 499 when some envious 500 surge</p>
<p>Will in his brinish 501 bowels swallow him.</p>
<p>This way to death my wretched sons are gone:</p>
<p>Here stands my other son, a banished man,</p>
<p>And here my brother, weeping at my woes.</p>
<p>But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn 502</p>
<p>Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.</p>
<p>Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,</p>
<p>It would have madded me. What shall I do</p>
<p>Now I behold thy lively 503 body so?</p>
<p>Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,</p>
<p>Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyred thee:</p>
<p>Thy husband he is dead, and for his death</p>
<p>Thy brothers are condemned, and dead by this 504 .—</p>
<p>Look, Marcus, ah, son Lucius, look on her!</p>
<p>When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears</p>
<p>Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew 505</p>
<p>Upon a gathered lily almost withered.</p>
<p>MARCUS Perchance she weeps because they killed her husband,</p>
<p>Perchance because she knows them innocent.</p>
<p>TITUS If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,</p>
<p>Because the law hath ta’en revenge on them.</p>
<p>No, no, they would not do so foul a deed:</p>
<p>Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.</p>
<p>Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips</p>
<p>Or make some signs how I may do thee ease 506 :</p>
<p>Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius,</p>
<p>And thou and I sit round about some fountain,</p>
<p>Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks,</p>
<p>How they are stained like meadows yet not dry,</p>
<p>With miry 507 slime left on them by a flood?</p>
<p>And in the fountain shall we gaze so long</p>
<p>Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness 508 ,</p>
<p>And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?</p>
<p>Or shall we cut away our hands like thine?</p>
<p>Or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows 509</p>
<p>Pass the remainder of our hateful days?</p>
<p>What shall we do? Let us that have our tongues</p>
<p>Plot some device 510 of further miseries</p>
<p>To make us wondered at in time to come.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Sweet father, cease your tears, for at your grief</p>
<p>See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.</p>
<p>MARCUS Patience, dear niece.— Good Titus, dry thine eyes.</p>
<p>Gives a handkerchief</p>
<p>TITUS Ah, Marcus, Marcus, brother, well I wot 511</p>
<p>Thy napkin 512 cannot drink a tear of mine,</p>
<p>For thou, poor man, hast drowned it with thine own.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.</p>
<p>TITUS Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:</p>
<p>Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say</p>
<p>That to her brother which I said to thee.</p>
<p>His napkin with his true tears all bewet</p>
<p>Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.</p>
<p>O, what a sympathy 513 of woe is this:</p>
<p>As far from help as Limbo 514 is from bliss!</p>
<p>Enter Aaron the Moor alone</p>
<p>AARON Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor</p>
<p>Sends thee this word: that if thou love thy sons,</p>
<p>Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,</p>
<p>Or any one of you, chop off your hand</p>
<p>And send it to the king: he for the same</p>
<p>Will send thee hither both thy sons alive —</p>
<p>And that shall be the ransom for their fault.</p>
<p>TITUS O gracious emperor, O gentle Aaron!</p>
<p>Did ever raven sing so like a lark</p>
<p>That gives sweet tidings of the sun’s uprise?</p>
<p>With all my heart, I’ll send the emperor my hand.</p>
<p>Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?</p>
<p>LUCIUS Stay, father, for that noble hand of thine</p>
<p>That hath thrown down so many enemies</p>
<p>Shall not be sent. My hand will serve the turn:</p>
<p>My youth can better spare my blood than you,</p>
<p>And therefore mine shall save my brothers’ lives.</p>
<p>MARCUS Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,</p>
<p>And reared aloft the bloody battle-axe,</p>
<p>Writing destruction on the enemy’s castle 515 ?</p>
<p>O, none of both 516 but are of high desert.</p>
<p>My hand hath been but idle: let it serve</p>
<p>To ransom my two nephews from their death,</p>
<p>Then have I kept it to a worthy end.</p>
<p>AARON Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,</p>
<p>For fear they die before their pardon come.</p>
<p>MARCUS My hand shall go.</p>
<p>LUCIUS By heaven, it shall not go!</p>
<p>TITUS Sirs, strive no more: such withered herbs as these</p>
<p>Are meet 517 for plucking up, and therefore mine.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,</p>
<p>Let me redeem my brothers both from death.</p>
<p>MARCUS And for our father’s sake and mother’s care,</p>
<p>Now let me show a brother’s love to thee.</p>
<p>TITUS Agree between you: I will spare 518 my hand.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Then I’ll go fetch an axe.</p>
<p>MARCUS But I will use the axe.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Lucius and Marcus ]</p>
<p>TITUS Come hither, Aaron, I’ll deceive them both:</p>
<p>Lend me thy hand and I will give thee mine.</p>
<p>AARON If that be called deceit, I will be honest</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>And never whilst I live deceive men so.</p>
<p>But I’ll deceive you in another sort,</p>
<p>And that you’ll say 519 , ere half an hour pass.</p>
<p>He cuts off Titus’ hand</p>
<p>Enter Lucius and Marcus again</p>
<p>TITUS Now stay your strife 520 : what shall be is dispatched.</p>
<p>Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:</p>
<p>Tell him it was a hand that warded 521 him</p>
<p>From thousand dangers: bid him bury it:</p>
<p>More hath it merited: that 522 let it have.</p>
<p>As for my sons, say I account of 523 them</p>
<p>As jewels purchased at an easy price,</p>
<p>And yet dear 524 too, because I bought mine own 525 .</p>
<p>AARON I go, Andronicus, and for thy hand</p>
<p>Look 526 by and by to have thy sons with thee.—</p>
<p>Their heads I mean. O, how this villainy</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>Doth fat 527 me with the very thoughts of it!</p>
<p>Let fools do good and fair 528 men call for grace.</p>
<p>Aaron will have his soul black like his face.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>TITUS O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven</p>
<p>And bow this feeble ruin 529 to the earth.</p>
<p>Kneels</p>
<p>If any power pities wretched tears,</p>
<p>To that I call!— What, wilt thou kneel with me?</p>
<p>Lavinia kneels</p>
<p>Do then, dear heart, for heaven shall hear our prayers,</p>
<p>Or with our sighs we’ll breathe the welkin 530 dim,</p>
<p>And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds</p>
<p>When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.</p>
<p>MARCUS O brother, speak with possibilities 531 ,</p>
<p>And do not break into these deep extremes.</p>
<p>TITUS Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?</p>
<p>Then be my passions 532 bottomless with them.</p>
<p>MARCUS But yet let reason govern thy lament.</p>
<p>TITUS If there were reason for these miseries,</p>
<p>Then into limits could I bind my woes:</p>
<p>When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o’erflow 533 ?</p>
<p>If the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad,</p>
<p>Threat’ning the welkin with his big-swoll’n face?</p>
<p>And wilt thou have a reason for this coil 534 ?</p>
<p>I am the sea. Hark how her 535 sighs do blow!</p>
<p>She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:</p>
<p>Then must my sea be movèd 536 with her sighs,</p>
<p>Then must my earth with her continual tears</p>
<p>Become a deluge overflowed and drowned,</p>
<p>For why 537 my bowels 538 cannot hide her woes,</p>
<p>But like a drunkard must I vomit them.</p>
<p>Then give me leave, for losers will have leave</p>
<p>To ease their stomachs 539 with their bitter tongues.</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger with two heads and a hand</p>
<p>Titus and Lavinia may rise here</p>
<p>MESSENGER Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid</p>
<p>For that good hand thou sent’st the emperor.</p>
<p>Here are the heads of thy two noble sons,</p>
<p>And here’s thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back:</p>
<p>Sets down the heads and hand</p>
<p>Thy griefs their sports 540 , thy resolution mocked,</p>
<p>That 541 woe is me to think upon thy woes</p>
<p>More than remembrance of my father’s death.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>MARCUS Now let hot Aetna 542 cool in Sicily,</p>
<p>And be my heart an ever-burning hell!</p>
<p>These miseries are more than may be borne.</p>
<p>To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal 543 ,</p>
<p>But sorrow flouted 544 at is double death.</p>
<p>LUCIUS Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,</p>
<p>And yet detested life not shrink 545 thereat!</p>
<p>That ever death should let life bear his name 546 ,</p>
<p>Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!</p>
<p>Lavinia kisses the heads</p>
<p>MARCUS Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless</p>
<p>As frozen water to a starvèd 547 snake.</p>
<p>TITUS When will this fearful slumber have an end?</p>
<p>MARCUS Now farewell flattery 548 , die Andronicus:</p>
<p>Thou dost not slumber. See thy two sons’ heads,</p>
<p>Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here,</p>
<p>Thy other banished son with this dear 549 sight</p>
<p>Struck pale and bloodless, and thy brother, I,</p>
<p>Even like a stony image, cold and numb.</p>
<p>Ah, now no more will I control 550 thy griefs:</p>
<p>Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand</p>
<p>Gnawing with thy teeth, and be this dismal sight</p>
<p>The closing up of our most wretched eyes.</p>
<p>Now is a time to storm. Why art thou still?</p>
<p>TITUS Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>MARCUS Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.</p>
<p>TITUS Why? I have not another tear to shed:</p>
<p>Besides, this sorrow is an enemy</p>
<p>And would usurp upon my wat’ry eyes</p>
<p>And make them blind with tributary 551 tears.</p>
<p>Then which way shall I find Revenge’s cave?</p>
<p>For these two heads do seem to speak to me</p>
<p>And threat 552 me I shall never come to bliss</p>
<p>Till all these mischiefs 553 be returned again</p>
<p>Even in their throats that have committed them.</p>
<p>Come, let me see what task I have to do.</p>
<p>You heavy 554 people, circle me about,</p>
<p>That I may turn me to each one of you</p>
<p>And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.</p>
<p>They make a vow</p>
<p>The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,</p>
<p>And in this hand the other I will bear.</p>
<p>And Lavinia, thou shalt be employed in these things:</p>
<p>Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.</p>
<p>As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight:</p>
<p>Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:</p>
<p>Hie to the Goths and raise an army there,</p>
<p>And if you love me, as I think you do,</p>
<p>Let’s kiss and part, for we have much to do.</p>
<p>Exeunt. Lucius remains</p>
<p>LUCIUS Farewell Andronicus, my noble father,</p>
<p>The woefull’st man that ever lived in Rome.</p>
<p>Farewell, proud Rome, till Lucius come again.</p>
<p>He loves his pledges 555 dearer than his life.</p>
<p>Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister,</p>
<p>O, would thou wert as thou tofore 556 hast been!</p>
<p>But now nor 557 Lucius nor Lavinia lives</p>
<p>But 558 in oblivion and hateful griefs.</p>
<p>If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs</p>
<p>And make proud Saturnine and his empress</p>
<p>Beg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen 559 .</p>
<p>Now will I to the Goths and raise a power 560 ,</p>
<p>To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.</p>
<p>Exit Lucius</p>
