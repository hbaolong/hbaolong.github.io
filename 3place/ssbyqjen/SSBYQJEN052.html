<h4 id="scene-2-running-scene-6">Scene 2 ／ running scene 6</h4>
<p>Enter Falstaff [and ] Pistol</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I will not lend thee a penny.</p>
<p>PISTOL Why, then the world’s mine oyster, which I with sword will
open.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should lay my
countenance 436 to pawn 437 . I have grated upon 438 my good friends for
three reprieves for you and your coach-fellow 439 Nim, or else you had
looked through the grate 440 , like a gemini 441 of baboons. I am damned
in hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends you were good soldiers and
tall fellows. And when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan 442 ,
I took’t upon 443 mine honour thou hadst it not.</p>
<p>PISTOL Didst not thou share 444 ? Hadst thou not fifteen pence?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Reason 445 , you rogue, reason. Think’st thou I’ll endanger
my soul gratis 446 ? At a word, hang no more about me 447 , I am no
gibbet for you. Go—a short knife and a throng 448 — to your manor of
Picked-hatch 449 , go! You’ll not bear a letter for me, you rogue. You
stand upon your honour. Why, thou unconfinable 450 baseness, it is as
much as I can do to keep the terms of my honour precise 451 . Ay, ay, I
myself sometimes, leaving the fear of heaven on the left hand 452 , and
hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to shuffle, to hedge and to
lurch 453 : and yet, you rogue, will ensconce 454 your rags, your
cat-a-mountain 455 looks, your red-lattice 456 phrases, and your
bold-beating 457 oaths, under the shelter of your honour? You will not
do it?</p>
<p>You?</p>
<p>PISTOL I do relent 458 . What would thou more of man?</p>
<p>[Enter Robin ]</p>
<p>ROBIN Sir, here’s a woman would speak with you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Let her approach.</p>
<p>[Enter Mistress Quickly ]</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Give 459 your worship good morrow.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Good morrow, good wife.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Not so 460 , an’t please your worship.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Good maid, then.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY That I am, I’ll be sworn,</p>
<p>As my mother was the first hour I was born 461 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I do believe the swearer. What with me?</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Shall I vouchsafe 462 your worship a word or
two?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Two thousand, fair woman, and I’ll vouchsafe thee the
hearing.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY There is one Mistress Ford, sir — I pray come a
little nearer this ways 463 — I myself dwell with master Doctor
Caius—</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well, on 464 . Mistress Ford, you say—</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Your worship says very true. I pray your worship
come a little nearer this ways.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I warrant thee nobody hears. Mine own people, mine own
people.</p>
<p>Gestures toward Pistol and Robin</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Are they so? Heaven bless them, and make them his
servants.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well, Mistress Ford: what of her?</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Why, sir, she’s a good creature. Lord, lord, your
worship’s a wanton 465 ! Well, heaven forgive you, and all of us, I
pray—</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Mistress Ford, come, Mistress Ford.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Marry, this is the short and the long of it: you
have brought her into such a canaries 466 as ’tis wonderful 467 . The
best courtier of them all — when the court lay at Windsor—could never
have brought her to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and
lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant you—coach after
coach, letter after letter, gift after gift, smelling so sweetly, all
musk, and so rushling 468 , I warrant you, in silk and gold, and in such
alligant 469 terms, and in such wine and sugar of the best and the
fairest that would have won any woman’s heart: and, I warrant you, they
could never get an eye-wink of 470 her. I had myself twenty angels 471
given me this morning, but I defy all angels — in any such sort 472 , as
they say — but in the way of honesty: and, I warrant you, they could
never get her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all. And
yet there has been earls, nay, which is more, pensioners 473 , but, I
warrant you, all is one with her.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF But what says she to me? Be brief, my good she-Mercury 474
.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which
she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you to notify 475 that
her husband will be absence from his house between ten and eleven.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Ten and eleven.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Ay, forsooth, and then you may come and see the
picture, she says, that you wot 476 of. Master Ford, her husband, will
be from home. Alas, the sweet woman leads an ill life with him: he’s a
very jealousy man. She leads a very frampold 477 life with him, good
heart.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her. I will not fail
her.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Why, you say well. But I have another messenger 478
to your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you too:
and let me tell you in your ear, she’s as fartuous 479 a civil modest
480 wife, and one, I tell you, that will not miss you 481 morning nor
evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe’er be the other: and she bade
me tell your worship that her husband is seldom from home, but she hopes
there will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon a man. Surely
I think you have charms 482 , la. Yes, in truth.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Not I, I assure thee. Setting the attraction of my good
parts 483 aside, I have no other charms.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Blessing on your heart for’t!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF But I pray thee tell me this: has Ford’s wife and Page’s
wife acquainted each other how they love me?</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY That were a jest indeed! They have not so little
grace 484 , I hope — that were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page would
desire you to send her your little page, of all loves 485 . Her husband
has a marvellous infection to 486 the little page, and truly Master Page
is an honest man. Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she
does: do what she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed
when she list 487 , rise when she list, all is as she will, and truly
she deserves it, for if there be a kind 488 woman in Windsor, she is
one. You must send her your page, no remedy.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Why, I will.</p>
<p>MISTRESS QUICKLY Nay, but do so, then, and, look you, he may come and
go between you both: and in any case have a nay-word 489 , that you may
know one another’s mind, and the boy never need to understand anything,
for ’tis not good that children should know any wickedness. Old folks,
you know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Fare thee well, commend me to them both. There’s my purse: I
am yet thy debtor.— Boy, go along with this woman.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Mistress Quickly and Robin ]</p>
<p>This news distracts 490 me.</p>
<p>PISTOL This punk 491 is one of Cupid’s carriers 492 .</p>
<p>Clap 493 on more sails, pursue, up with your fights 494 ,</p>
<p>Give fire. She is my prize 495 , or ocean whelm 496 them all!</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Say’st thou so, old Jack? 497 Go thy ways: I’ll make more of
thy old body than I have done. Will they yet look after 498 thee? Wilt
thou, after the expense of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I
thank thee. Let them say ’tis grossly 499 done, so 500 it be fairly 501
done, no matter.</p>
<p>[Enter Bardolph, with a goblet ]</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Sir John, there’s one Master Broom below would fain 502
speak with you and be acquainted with you, and hath sent your worship a
morning’s draught of sack.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Broom is his name?</p>
<p>BARDOLPH Ay, sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Call him in.</p>
<p>[Exit Bardolph ]</p>
<p>Such Brooms are welcome to me, that o’erflows such liquor. Aha,
Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, have I encompassed 503 you? Go to, via
504 !</p>
<p>[Enter Bardolph, with Ford disguised, carrying a bag of money ]</p>
<p>FORD Bless you, sir.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF And you, sir. Would you speak with me?</p>
<p>FORD I make bold 505 to press with so little preparation 506 upon
you.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF You’re welcome. What’s your will? Give us leave 507 , drawer
508 .</p>
<p>[Exit Bardolph ]</p>
<p>FORD Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much: my name is
Broom.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Good Master Broom, I desire more acquaintance of you.</p>
<p>FORD Good Sir John, I sue 509 for yours: not to charge 510 you, for I
must let you understand I think myself in better plight 511 for a lender
than you are, the which hath something emboldened me to this unseasoned
512 intrusion. For they say, if money go before, all ways do lie
open.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on 513 .</p>
<p>FORD Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me. If you will
help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or half, for easing me of the
carriage 514 .</p>
<p>Sets it down</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.</p>
<p>FORD I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Speak, good Master Broom: I shall be glad to be your
servant.</p>
<p>FORD Sir, I hear you are a scholar — I will be brief with you — and
you have been a man long known to me, though I had never so good means
as desire to make myself acquainted with you. I shall discover 515 a
thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection.
But, good Sir John, as you have one eye upon my follies, as you hear
them unfolded, turn another into the register 516 of your own, that I
may pass with a reproof the easier, sith 517 you yourself know how easy
it is to be such an offender.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Very well, sir, proceed.</p>
<p>FORD There is a gentlewoman in this town, her husband’s name is
Ford.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Well, sir.</p>
<p>FORD I have long loved her, and, I protest to you, bestowed much on
her: followed her with a doting observance 518 , engrossed 519
opportunities to meet her, fee’d 520 every slight occasion that could
but niggardly give me sight of her: not only bought many presents to
give her, but have given largely 521 to many to know what she would have
given 522 . Briefly, I have pursued her as love hath pursued me, which
hath been on the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have merited,
either in my mind or in my means 523 , meed 524 I am sure I have
received none, unless experience be a jewel that I have purchased at an
infinite rate, and that hath taught me to say this:</p>
<p>’Love like a shadow flies 525 when substance 526 love pursues,</p>
<p>Pursuing that that flies 527 , and flying what pursues.’</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Have you received no promise of satisfaction 528 at her
hands?</p>
<p>FORD Never.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Have you importuned 529 her to such a purpose?</p>
<p>FORD Never.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Of what quality was your love, then?</p>
<p>FORD Like a fair house built on another man’s ground, so that I have
lost my edifice by mistaking the place where I erected 530 it.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?</p>
<p>FORD When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say that
though she appear honest 531 to me, yet in other places she enlargeth
her mirth 532 so far that there is shrewd construction 533 made of her.
Now, Sir John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of
excellent breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance 534 ,
authentic 535 in your place and person, generally allowed 536 for your
many war-like, court-like and learned preparations 537 .</p>
<p>FALSTAFF O, sir!</p>
<p>FORD Believe it, for you know it. There is money: spend it, spend it,
spend more, spend all I have, only give me so much of your time in
exchange of it, as to lay an amiable 538 siege to the honesty of this
Ford’s wife. Use your art of wooing, win her to consent to you. If any
man may, you may as soon as any.</p>
<p>Points to the bag</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Would it apply well to 539 the vehemency of your affection
that I should win what you would enjoy? Methinks you prescribe to
yourself very preposterously 540 .</p>
<p>FORD O, understand my drift 541 : she dwells so securely on the
excellency of her honour that the folly 542 of my soul dares not present
itself. She is too bright to be looked against 543 . Now, could I come
to her with any detection 544 in my hand, my desires had instance 545
and argument to commend themselves: I could drive her then from the ward
546 of her purity, her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand
other her 547 defences, which now are too too strongly embattled against
me. What say you to’t, Sir John?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Master Broom, I will first make bold with your money. Next,
give me your hand. And last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if you
will, enjoy Ford’s wife.</p>
<p>Takes the bag</p>
<p>FORD O, good sir!</p>
<p>FALSTAFF I say you shall.</p>
<p>FORD Want 548 no money, Sir John: you shall want none.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Want no Mistress Ford, Master Broom, you shall want none. I
shall be with her, I may tell you, by her own appointment. Even as you
came in to me, her assistant or go-between parted from me. I say I shall
be with her between ten and eleven, for at that time the jealous
rascally knave her husband will be forth 549 . Come you to me at night:
you shall know how I speed 550 .</p>
<p>FORD I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford, sir?</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave, I know him not. Yet I wrong
him to call him poor: they say the jealous wittolly 551 knave hath
masses of money, for the which 552 his wife seems to me well-favoured
553 . I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue’s coffer, and
there’s my harvest-home 554 .</p>
<p>FORD I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him if you saw
him.</p>
<p>FALSTAFF Hang him, mechanical 555 salt-butter 556 rogue! I will stare
him out of his wits, I will awe him with my cudgel. It shall hang like a
meteor 557 o’er the cuckold’s horns. Master Broom, thou shalt know I
will predominate 558 over the peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife.
Come to me soon at night. Ford’s a knave, and I will aggravate his style
559 . Thou, Master Broom, shalt know him for knave and cuckold. Come to
me soon at night.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>FORD What a damned Epicurean 560 rascal is this? My heart is ready to
crack with impatience. Who says this is improvident 561 jealousy? My
wife hath sent to him, the hour is fixed, the match is made. Would any
man have thought this? See the hell of having a false 562 woman: my bed
shall be abused, my coffers ransacked, my reputation gnawn at, and I
shall not only receive this villainous wrong, but stand under the
adoption of abominable terms 563 , and by him that does me this wrong.
Terms, names! Amaimon sounds well: Lucifer, well: Barbason 564 , well:
yet they are devils’ additions 565 , the names of fiends. But Cuckold?
Wittol? Cuckold? The devil himself hath not such a name. Page is an ass,
a secure 566 ass. He will trust his wife, he will not be jealous. I will
rather trust a Fleming 567 with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with
my cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae 568 bottle, or a thief to walk
569 my ambling gelding 570 , than my wife with herself. Then she plots,
then she ruminates, then she devises: and what they think in their
hearts they may effect — they will break their hearts but they will
effect. Heaven be praised for my jealousy! Eleven o’clock the hour. I
will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on Falstaff, and laugh at
Page. I will about it. Better three hours too soon than a minute too
late. Fie, fie, fie! Cuckold, cuckold, cuckold!</p>
<p>Exit</p>
