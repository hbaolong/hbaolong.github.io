<h4 id="scene-3-781-running-scene-7">Scene 3 781 / running scene 7</h4>
<p>Enter seven or eight Citizens</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN Once 782 , if he do require our voices, we ought not to
deny him.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN We may, sir, if we will.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN We have power in ourselves to do 783 it, but it is a
power that we have no power to do: for, if he show us his wounds and
tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak
for them: so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him our
noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is monstrous 784 , and for the
multitude to be ingrateful, were to make a monster of the multitude: of
the which we, being members, should bring ourselves to be monstrous
members.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN And to make us no better thought of, a little help will
serve 785 : for once 786 we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck
787 not to call us the many-headed multitude.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN We have been called so of 788 many, not that 789 our
heads are some brown, some black, some abram 790 , some bald, but that
our wits are so diversely coloured: and truly I think if all our wits
were to issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
and their consent of 791 one direct way should be at once to all the
points o’th’compass.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
fly?</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN Nay, your wit will not so soon out 792 as another man’s
will 793 : ’tis strongly wedged up in a blockhead: but if it were at
liberty, ’twould sure southward 794 .</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Why that way?</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts melted
away with rotten 795 dews, the fourth would return for conscience’ sake,
to help to get thee a wife.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN You are never without your tricks: you may 796 , you
may.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN Are you all resolved to give your voices? But that’s no
matter, the greater part 797 carries it. I say, if he would incline 798
to the people, there was never a worthier man.</p>
<p>Enter Coriolanus in a gown of humility, with Menenius</p>
<p>Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his behaviour. We
are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he stands, by
ones, by twos, and by threes. He’s to make his requests by particulars
799 , wherein every one of us has a single honour 800 , in giving him
our own voices with our own tongues: therefore follow me, and I’ll
direct you how you shall go by him.</p>
<p>ALL Content, content.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Citizens ]</p>
<p>MENENIUS O sir, you are not right: have you not known</p>
<p>The worthiest men have done’t?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS What must I say?</p>
<p>‘I pray, sir’? Plague upon’t, I cannot bring</p>
<p>My tongue to such a pace 801 : ’Look, sir, my wounds:</p>
<p>I got them in my country’s service when</p>
<p>Some certain of your brethren roared and ran</p>
<p>From th’noise of our own drums.’</p>
<p>MENENIUS O me, the gods! You must not speak of that:</p>
<p>You must desire them to think upon you.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Think upon me? Hang ’em:</p>
<p>I would 802 they would forget me, like the virtues 803</p>
<p>Which our divines 804 lose by 805 ’em.</p>
<p>MENENIUS You’ll mar all:</p>
<p>I’ll leave you: pray you, speak to ’em, I pray you,</p>
<p>In wholesome 806 manner.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Bid them wash their faces</p>
<p>And keep their teeth clean.</p>
<p>Enter three of the Citizens</p>
<p>So, here comes a brace 807 .</p>
<p>You know the cause, sir, of my standing here.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN We do, sir: tell us what hath brought you to’t.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Mine own desert.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Your own desert?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Ay, but not mine own desire.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN How not your own desire?</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS No, sir, ’twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor
with begging.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to
gain by you.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Well then, I pray, your price o’th’consulship?</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN The price is to ask it kindly 808 .</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Kindly, sir, I pray let me ha’t: I have wounds to show
you, which shall be yours 809 in private: your good voice, sir: what say
you?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN You shall ha’t, worthy sir.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS A match 810 , sir. There’s in all two worthy voices
begged: I have your alms: adieu.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN But this is something 811 odd.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN An ’twere 812 to give again — but ’tis no matter.</p>
<p>Exeunt [Citizens ]</p>
<p>Enter two other Citizens</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Pray you now, if it may stand 813 with the tune of your
voices that I may be consul, I have here the customary gown.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN You have deserved nobly of your country, and you have
not deserved nobly.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Your enigma 814 ?</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN You have been a scourge 815 to her enemies, you have
been a rod 816 to her friends: you have not indeed loved the common 817
people.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS You should account me the more virtuous that I have not
been common in my love: I will, sir, flatter my sworn brother 818 the
people to earn a dearer estimation of them 819 : ’tis a condition 820
they account gentle 821 : and since the wisdom of their choice is rather
to have my hat 822 than my heart, I will practise the insinuating 823
nod, and be off 824 to them most counterfeitly 825 : that is, sir, I
will counterfeit the bewitchment 826 of some popular man 827 and give it
bountiful 828 to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you, I may be
consul.</p>
<p>FIFTH CITIZEN We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you
our voices heartily.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN You have received many wounds for your country.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS I will not seal 829 your knowledge with showing them. I
will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.</p>
<p>BOTH CITIZENS The gods give you joy, sir, heartily.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Citizens ]</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Most sweet voices:</p>
<p>Better it is to die, better to starve,</p>
<p>Than crave 830 the hire 831 which first we do deserve.</p>
<p>Why in this wolvish tongue 832 should I stand here,</p>
<p>To beg of Hob and Dick that does appear 833</p>
<p>Their needless 834 vouches 835 ? Custom calls me to’t.</p>
<p>What custom wills, in all things should we do’t?</p>
<p>The dust on antique time 836 would lie unswept,</p>
<p>And mountainous error be too highly heaped</p>
<p>For truth to o’erpeer 837 . Rather than fool it so,</p>
<p>Let the high office and the honour go</p>
<p>To one that would do thus 838 . I am half through:</p>
<p>The one part suffered, the other will I do.</p>
<p>Enter three Citizens more</p>
<p>Here come more voices 839 .</p>
<p>Your voices! For your voices I have fought,</p>
<p>Watched 840 for your voices: for your voices bear</p>
<p>Of wounds two dozen odd: battles thrice six</p>
<p>I have seen and heard of 841 : for your voices have</p>
<p>Done many things, some less, some more: your voices!</p>
<p>Indeed I would be consul.</p>
<p>SIXTH CITIZEN He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
man’s voice.</p>
<p>SEVENTH CITIZEN Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
and make him good friend to the people.</p>
<p>ALL CITIZENS Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Worthy voices!</p>
<p>[Exeunt Citizens ]</p>
<p>Enter Menenius, with Brutus and Sicinius</p>
<p>MENENIUS You have stood your limitation 842 , and the tribunes</p>
<p>Endue 843 you with the people’s voice: remains 844</p>
<p>That in th’official marks 845 invested, you</p>
<p>Anon 846 do meet the senate.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Is this done?</p>
<p>SICINIUS The custom of request 847 you have discharged:</p>
<p>The people do admit you, and are summoned</p>
<p>To meet anon, upon your approbation 848 .</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS Where? At the senate house?</p>
<p>SICINIUS There, Coriolanus.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS May I change these garments?</p>
<p>SICINIUS You may, sir.</p>
<p>CORIOLANUS That I’ll straight do, and, knowing myself again,</p>
<p>Repair 849 to th’senate house.</p>
<p>MENENIUS I’ll keep you company.— Will you along?</p>
<p>To the Tribunes</p>
<p>BRUTUS We stay here for the people.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Fare you well.</p>
<p>Exeunt Coriolanus and Menenius</p>
<p>He has it now, and by his looks methinks</p>
<p>’Tis warm at’s heart.</p>
<p>BRUTUS With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds 850 .</p>
<p>Will you dismiss the people?</p>
<p>Enter the Plebeians [Citizens ]</p>
<p>SICINIUS How now, my masters 851 , have you chose this man?</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN He has our voices, sir.</p>
<p>BRUTUS We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice 852 ,</p>
<p>He mocked us when he begged our voices.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN Certainly: he flouted 853 us downright.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN No, ’tis his kind of speech 854 : he did not mock
us.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says</p>
<p>He used us scornfully: he should have showed us</p>
<p>His marks of merit, wounds received for’s country.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Why, so he did, I am sure.</p>
<p>ALL CITIZENS No, no: no man saw ’em.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN He said he had wounds, which he could show in
private;</p>
<p>And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,</p>
<p>‘I would be consul’, says he: ’Agèd custom,</p>
<p>But by your voices, will not so permit me.</p>
<p>Your voices therefore.’ When we granted that,</p>
<p>Here was ’I thank you for your voices: thank you:</p>
<p>Your most sweet voices: now you have left your voices,</p>
<p>I have no further with 855 you.’ Was not this mockery?</p>
<p>SICINIUS Why either were you ignorant 856 to see’t,</p>
<p>Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness</p>
<p>To yield your voices?</p>
<p>BRUTUS Could you not have told him</p>
<p>To the Citizens</p>
<p>As you were lessoned 857 : when he had no power,</p>
<p>But was a petty servant to the state,</p>
<p>He was your enemy, ever 858 spake against</p>
<p>Your liberties and the charters that you bear</p>
<p>I’th’body of the weal 859 : and now arriving 860</p>
<p>A place of potency and sway o’th’state 861 ,</p>
<p>If he should still malignantly remain</p>
<p>Fast foe to th’plebeii 862 , your voices might</p>
<p>Be curses to yourselves. You should have said</p>
<p>That as his worthy deeds did claim no less</p>
<p>Than what he stood for 863 , so his gracious nature</p>
<p>Would think upon 864 you for your voices, and</p>
<p>Translate 865 his malice towards you into love,</p>
<p>Standing your friendly lord 866 .</p>
<p>SICINIUS Thus to have said,</p>
<p>To the Citizens</p>
<p>As you were fore-advised, had touched 867 his spirit</p>
<p>And tried his inclination: from him plucked</p>
<p>Either his gracious promise, which you might,</p>
<p>As cause 868 had called you up 869 , have held him to:</p>
<p>Or else it would have galled 870 his surly nature,</p>
<p>Which easily endures not article 871</p>
<p>Tying him to aught 872 : so putting him to rage,</p>
<p>You should have ta’en th’advantage of his choler 873</p>
<p>And passed him unelected.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Did you perceive</p>
<p>To the Citizens</p>
<p>He did solicit you in free 874 contempt</p>
<p>When he did need your loves? And do you think</p>
<p>That his contempt shall not be bruising to you</p>
<p>When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies</p>
<p>No heart 875 among you? Or had you tongues to cry 876</p>
<p>Against the rectorship 877 of judgement?</p>
<p>SICINIUS Have you, ere now, denied the asker 878 ,</p>
<p>To the Citizens</p>
<p>And now again, of him that did not ask but mock,</p>
<p>Bestow your sued-for 879 tongues?</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN He’s not confirmed: we may deny him yet.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN And will deny him:</p>
<p>I’ll have five hundred voices of that sound.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 880
’em.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends</p>
<p>They have chose a consul that will from them take</p>
<p>Their liberties: make them of no more voice</p>
<p>Than dogs that are as often beat for barking</p>
<p>As therefor 881 kept to do so.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Let them assemble, and on a safer 882 judgement</p>
<p>To the Citizens</p>
<p>All revoke your ignorant election: enforce 883 his pride,</p>
<p>And his old hate unto you: besides, forget not</p>
<p>With what contempt he wore the humble weed,</p>
<p>How in his suit 884 he scorned you: but your loves,</p>
<p>Thinking upon his services, took from you</p>
<p>Th’apprehension 885 of his present portance,</p>
<p>Which most gibingly 886 , ungravely 887 , he did fashion</p>
<p>After 888 the inveterate 889 hate he bears you.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Lay a fault on 890 us, your tribunes,</p>
<p>To the Citizens</p>
<p>That we laboured, no impediment between 891 ,</p>
<p>But that you must cast your election on him.</p>
<p>SICINIUS Say you chose him more after our commandment</p>
<p>To the Citizens</p>
<p>Than as guided by your own true affections 892 , and that</p>
<p>Your minds, preoccupied with what you rather must do</p>
<p>Than what you should, made you against the grain 893</p>
<p>To voice 894 him consul. Lay the fault on us.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Ay, spare us not: say we read lectures to 895 you,</p>
<p>To the Citizens</p>
<p>How youngly 896 he began to serve his country,</p>
<p>How long continued, and what stock he springs of,</p>
<p>The noble house o’th’Martians, from whence came</p>
<p>That Ancus Martius 897 , Numa 898 ’s daughter’s son,</p>
<p>Who after great Hostilius 899 here was king:</p>
<p>Of the same house Publius 900 and Quintus were,</p>
<p>That our best water brought by conduits 901 902 hither:</p>
<p>And Censorinus 903 that was so surnamed,</p>
<p>And nobly named so, twice being censor 904 ,</p>
<p>Was his great ancestor.</p>
<p>SICINIUS One thus descended,</p>
<p>That hath beside well in his person wrought 905</p>
<p>To be set high in place, we did commend</p>
<p>To your remembrances: but you have found,</p>
<p>Scaling 906 his present bearing with his past,</p>
<p>That he’s your fixèd enemy, and revoke</p>
<p>Your sudden 907 approbation.</p>
<p>BRUTUS Say, you ne’er had done’t —</p>
<p>Harp on that still — but by our putting on 908 :</p>
<p>And presently, when you have drawn your number 909 ,</p>
<p>Repair 910 to th’Capitol.</p>
<p>ALL We will so: almost all repent in their election.</p>
<p>Exeunt Plebeians [Citizens ]</p>
<p>BRUTUS Let them go on:</p>
<p>This mutiny were better put in hazard 911 ,</p>
<p>Than stay, past doubt, for greater 912 :</p>
<p>If, as his nature is, he fall in rage</p>
<p>With their refusal, both observe and answer</p>
<p>The vantage of 913 his anger.</p>
<p>SICINIUS To th’Capitol, come:</p>
<p>We will be there before the stream o’th’people,</p>
<p>And this shall seem, as partly ’tis, their own 914 ,</p>
<p>Which we have goaded onward.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 3</p>
