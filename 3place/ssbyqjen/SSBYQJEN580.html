<p>Flourish. Enter Pompey at one door, with Drum and Trumpet 679 , at
another, Caesar, Lepidus, Antony, Enobarbus, Maecenas, Agrippa, Menas
with Soldiers marching</p>
<p>POMPEY Your hostages I have, so have you mine,</p>
<p>And we shall talk before we fight.</p>
<p>CAESAR Most meet 680</p>
<p>That first we come to words, and therefore have we</p>
<p>Our written purposes 681 before us sent,</p>
<p>Which, if thou hast considered, let us know</p>
<p>If ’twill tie up 682 thy discontented sword</p>
<p>And carry back to Sicily much tall 683 youth</p>
<p>That else 684 must perish here.</p>
<p>POMPEY To you all three,</p>
<p>The senators alone 685 of this great world,</p>
<p>Chief factors 686 for the gods: I do not know</p>
<p>Wherefore 687 my father 688 should revengers want 689 ,</p>
<p>Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,</p>
<p>Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted 690 ,</p>
<p>There saw you labouring for him. What was’t</p>
<p>That moved 691 pale Cassius to conspire? And what</p>
<p>Made the all-honoured, honest 692 Roman, Brutus,</p>
<p>With the armed rest, courtiers 693 of beauteous freedom,</p>
<p>To drench 694 the Capitol 695 , but that they would</p>
<p>Have one man but a man 696 ? And that is it</p>
<p>Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden</p>
<p>The angered ocean foams, with which I meant</p>
<p>To scourge 697 th’ingratitude that despiteful 698 Rome</p>
<p>Cast on my noble father.</p>
<p>CAESAR Take your time.</p>
<p>ANTONY Thou canst not fear 699 us, Pompey, with thy sails.</p>
<p>We’ll speak 700 with thee at sea. At land thou know’st</p>
<p>How much we do o’er-count 701 thee.</p>
<p>POMPEY At land indeed</p>
<p>Thou dost o’er-count me of my father’s house 702 :</p>
<p>But since the cuckoo builds not for himself 703 ,</p>
<p>Remain in’t as thou mayst 704 .</p>
<p>LEPIDUS Be pleased to tell us —</p>
<p>For this is from the present 705 — how you take 706</p>
<p>The offers we have sent you.</p>
<p>CAESAR There’s the point.</p>
<p>ANTONY Which do not be entreated to 707 , but weigh 708</p>
<p>What it is worth embraced 709 .</p>
<p>CAESAR And what may follow,</p>
<p>To try a larger fortune 710 .</p>
<p>POMPEY You have made me offer</p>
<p>Of Sicily, Sardinia, and I must</p>
<p>Rid all the sea of pirates. Then to send</p>
<p>Measures of wheat to Rome: this ’greed upon</p>
<p>To part 711 with unhacked edges 712 , and bear back</p>
<p>Our targes 713 undinted 714 .</p>
<p>CAESAR, ANTONY and LEPIDUS That’s our offer.</p>
<p>POMPEY Know, then,</p>
<p>I came before you here a man prepared</p>
<p>To take this offer. But Mark Antony</p>
<p>Put me to some impatience, though I lose</p>
<p>The praise of 715 it by telling. You must 716 know</p>
<p>When Caesar and your brother were at blows,</p>
<p>Your mother came to Sicily and did find</p>
<p>Her welcome friendly.</p>
<p>ANTONY I have heard it, Pompey,</p>
<p>And am well studied 717 for a liberal thanks</p>
<p>Which I do owe you.</p>
<p>POMPEY Let me have your hand:</p>
<p>They shake hands</p>
<p>I did not think, sir, to have met you here.</p>
<p>ANTONY The beds i’th’east are soft, and thanks to you,</p>
<p>That called me timelier 718 than my purpose 719 hither,</p>
<p>For I have gained by’t.</p>
<p>CAESAR Since I saw you last, there’s a change upon you.</p>
<p>POMPEY Well, I know not</p>
<p>What counts 720 harsh fortune casts upon my face,</p>
<p>But in my bosom shall she never come</p>
<p>To make my heart her vassal 721 .</p>
<p>LEPIDUS Well met here.</p>
<p>POMPEY I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:</p>
<p>I crave our composition 722 may be written</p>
<p>And sealed between us 723 .</p>
<p>CAESAR That’s the next to do.</p>
<p>POMPEY We’ll feast each other ere we part, and let’s</p>
<p>Draw lots who shall begin.</p>
<p>ANTONY That will I, Pompey.</p>
<p>POMPEY No, Antony, take the lot 724 : but, first</p>
<p>Or last 725 , your fine Egyptian cookery</p>
<p>Shall have the fame 726 . I have heard that Julius Caesar</p>
<p>Grew fat with feasting there 727 .</p>
<p>ANTONY You have heard much.</p>
<p>POMPEY I have fair 728 meanings, sir.</p>
<p>ANTONY And fair words to them 729 .</p>
<p>POMPEY Then so much have I heard,</p>
<p>And I have heard, Apollodorus 730 carried—</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS No more of that: he did so.</p>
<p>POMPEY What, I pray you?</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.</p>
<p>POMPEY I know thee now. How far’st 731 thou, soldier?</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Well,</p>
<p>And well am like to do, for I perceive</p>
<p>Four feasts are toward 732 .</p>
<p>POMPEY Let me shake thy hand.</p>
<p>They shake hands</p>
<p>I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,</p>
<p>When I have envied thy behaviour 733 .</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Sir,</p>
<p>I never loved you much, but I ha’ praised ye</p>
<p>When you have well deserved ten times as much</p>
<p>As I have said you did.</p>
<p>POMPEY Enjoy thy plainness 734 ,</p>
<p>It nothing ill becomes 735 thee.</p>
<p>Aboard my galley 736 I invite you all.</p>
<p>Will you lead, lords?</p>
<p>CAESAR, ANTONY and LEPIDUS Show’s the way, sir.</p>
<p>POMPEY Come.</p>
<p>Exeunt. Enobarbus and Menas remain</p>
<p>MENAS Thy father, Pompey, would ne’er have made this treaty.—</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>You and I have known 737 , sir.</p>
<p>To Enobarbus</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS At sea, I think.</p>
<p>MENAS We have, sir.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS You have done well by water.</p>
<p>MENAS And you by land.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS I will praise any man that will praise me, though it cannot
be denied what I have done by land.</p>
<p>MENAS Nor what I have done by water.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have
been a great thief by sea.</p>
<p>MENAS And you by land.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS There I deny my land service. But give me your hand, Menas.
If our eyes had authority, here they might take 738 two thieves 739
kissing.</p>
<p>They shake hands</p>
<p>MENAS All men’s faces are true 740 , whatsome’er their hands are.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS But there is never a fair woman has a true 741 face.</p>
<p>MENAS No slander. They steal hearts.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS We came hither to fight with you.</p>
<p>MENAS For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking. Pompey doth
this day laugh away his fortune.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS If he do, sure he cannot weep’t back again.</p>
<p>MENAS You’ve said 742 , sir. We looked not for 743 Mark Antony here.
Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Caesar’s sister is called Octavia.</p>
<p>MENAS True, sir, she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.</p>
<p>MENAS Pray ye, sir? 744</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS ’Tis true.</p>
<p>MENAS Then is Caesar and he forever knit together.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS If I were bound to divine 745 of this unity, I would not
prophesy so.</p>
<p>MENAS I think the policy of that purpose made more in 746 the
marriage than the love of the parties.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS I think so too. But you shall find, the band 747 that seems
to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their
amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold and still 748 conversation 749 .</p>
<p>MENAS Who would not have his wife so?</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony. He
will to his Egyptian dish 750 again: then shall the sighs of Octavia
blow the fire up 751 in Caesar, and — as I said before — that which is
the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author 752 of
their variance 753 . Antony will use his affection where it is 754 . He
married but his occasion 755 here.</p>
<p>MENAS And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health
756 for you.</p>
<p>ENOBARBUS I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in
Egypt.</p>
<p>MENAS Come, let’s away.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
