<h4 id="scene-3-running-scene-10-continues">Scene 3 ／ running scene 10
continues</h4>
<p>Enter Clown [Pompey ]</p>
<p>POMPEY I am as well acquainted 1207 here as I was in our house of
profession 1208 : one would think it were Mistress Overdone’s own house,
for here be many of her old customers. First, here’s young Master Rash
1209 . He’s in for a commodity 1210 of brown paper 1211 and old 1212
ginger, ninescore and seventeen pounds, of which he made five marks
ready money 1213 . Marry, then ginger was not much in request, for the
old women 1214 were all dead. Then is there here one Master Caper 1215 ,
at the suit 1216 of Master Three-pile 1217 the mercer 1218 , for some
four suits of peach-coloured satin, which now peaches 1219 him a beggar.
Then have we here young Dizzy 1220 and young Master Deep-vow 1221 and
Master Copperspur 1222 and Master Starve-lackey 1223 the rapier 1224 and
dagger man, and young Drop-heir 1225 that killed lusty Pudding 1226 ,
and Master Forthright 1227 the tilter 1228 , and brave 1229 Master
Shoe-tie 1230 the great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed Pots
1231 , and I think forty more, all great doers in our trade 1232 , and
are now ‘for the Lord’s sake’ 1233 .</p>
<p>Enter Abhorson</p>
<p>ABHORSON Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.</p>
<p>POMPEY Master Barnardine! You must rise 1234 and be hanged. Master
Barnardine!</p>
<p>ABHORSON What ho, Barnardine!</p>
<p>BARNARDINE A pox 1235 o’your throats! Who makes that noise there?
What are you?</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>POMPEY Your friends, sir, the hangman. You must be so good, sir, to
1236 rise and be put to death.</p>
<p>BARNARDINE Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy.</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>ABHORSON Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.</p>
<p>POMPEY Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are executed, and
sleep afterwards.</p>
<p>ABHORSON Go in to him and fetch him out.</p>
<p>POMPEY He is coming, sir, he is coming: I hear his straw 1237
rustle.</p>
<p>Enter Barnardine</p>
<p>ABHORSON Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?</p>
<p>POMPEY Very ready, sir.</p>
<p>BARNARDINE How now, Abhorson? What’s the news with you?</p>
<p>ABHORSON Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into 1238 your
prayers, for, look you, the warrant’s come.</p>
<p>BARNARDINE You rogue, I have been drinking all night, I am not fitted
1239 for’t.</p>
<p>POMPEY O, the better, sir, for he that drinks all night, and is
hanged betimes 1240 in the morning, may sleep the sounder all the next
day.</p>
<p>Enter Duke [disguised as before ]</p>
<p>ABHORSON Look you, sir, here comes your ghostly father 1241 . Do we
jest now, think you?</p>
<p>DUKE Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily you are to
depart, I am come to advise you, comfort you and pray with you.</p>
<p>BARNARDINE Friar, not I. I have been drinking hard all night, and I
will have more time to prepare me, or they shall beat out my brains with
billets 1242 . I will not consent to die this day, that’s certain.</p>
<p>DUKE O, sir, you must, and therefore I beseech you</p>
<p>Look forward on the journey you shall go.</p>
<p>BARNARDINE I swear I will not die today for any man’s persuasion.</p>
<p>DUKE But hear you 1243 —</p>
<p>BARNARDINE Not a word. If you have anything to say to me, come to my
ward 1244 , for thence 1245 will not I today.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Provost</p>
<p>DUKE Unfit to live or die. O, gravel 1246 heart!</p>
<p>After him, fellows, bring him to the block.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Abhorson and Pompey ]</p>
<p>PROVOST Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?</p>
<p>DUKE A creature unprepared, unmeet 1247 for death,</p>
<p>And to transport him 1248 in the mind he is</p>
<p>Were damnable.</p>
<p>PROVOST Here in the prison, father,</p>
<p>There died this morning of a cruel fever</p>
<p>One Ragozine 1249 , a most notorious pirate,</p>
<p>A man of Claudio’s years 1250 , his beard and head 1251</p>
<p>Just of his colour. What if we do omit 1252</p>
<p>This reprobate 1253 till he were well inclined,</p>
<p>And satisfy the deputy with the visage 1254</p>
<p>Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?</p>
<p>DUKE O, ’tis an accident 1255 that heaven provides!</p>
<p>Dispatch it 1256 presently, the hour draws on</p>
<p>Prefixed 1257 by Angelo. See this be done,</p>
<p>And sent according to command, whiles I</p>
<p>Persuade this rude 1258 wretch willingly to die.</p>
<p>PROVOST This shall be done, good father, presently.</p>
<p>But Barnardine must die this afternoon.</p>
<p>And how shall we continue 1259 Claudio,</p>
<p>To save me from the danger that might come</p>
<p>If he were known alive?</p>
<p>DUKE Let this be done:</p>
<p>Put them in secret holds 1260 , both Barnardine and Claudio.</p>
<p>Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting 1261</p>
<p>To yonder generation 1262 , you shall find</p>
<p>Your safety manifested 1263 .</p>
<p>PROVOST I am your free dependant 1264 .</p>
<p>DUKE Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.</p>
<p>Exit [Provost ]</p>
<p>Now will I write letters to Angelo —</p>
<p>The provost, he shall bear them — whose contents</p>
<p>Shall witness to him I am near at home,</p>
<p>And that by great injunctions 1265 I am bound 1266</p>
<p>To enter publicly. Him I’ll desire</p>
<p>To meet me at the consecrated fount 1267 ,</p>
<p>A league 1268 below 1269 the city, and from thence,</p>
<p>By cold gradation 1270 and well-balanced form 1271 ,</p>
<p>We shall proceed with Angelo.</p>
<p>Enter Provost [with Ragozine’s head ]</p>
<p>PROVOST Here is the head. I’ll carry it myself.</p>
<p>DUKE Convenient is it. Make a swift return,</p>
<p>For I would commune 1272 with you of 1273 such things</p>
<p>That want no ear but yours.</p>
<p>PROVOST I’ll make all speed.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>ISABELLA Peace, ho, be here!</p>
<p>Within</p>
<p>DUKE The tongue of Isabel. She’s come to know</p>
<p>If yet her brother’s pardon be come hither.</p>
<p>But I will keep her ignorant of her good,</p>
<p>To make her heavenly comforts of despair,</p>
<p>When it is least expected.</p>
<p>Enter Isabella</p>
<p>ISABELLA Ho, by your leave!</p>
<p>DUKE Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.</p>
<p>ISABELLA The better, given me by so holy a man.</p>
<p>Hath yet the deputy sent my brother’s pardon?</p>
<p>DUKE He hath released him, Isabel — from the world.</p>
<p>His head is off and sent to Angelo.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Nay, but it is not so.</p>
<p>DUKE It is no other.</p>
<p>Show your wisdom, daughter, in your close 1274 patience.</p>
<p>ISABELLA O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!</p>
<p>DUKE You shall not be admitted to his sight.</p>
<p>ISABELLA Unhappy Claudio, wretched Isabel,</p>
<p>Injurious world, most damnèd Angelo!</p>
<p>DUKE This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot.</p>
<p>Forbear it 1275 therefore, give your cause to heaven.</p>
<p>Mark what I say, which you shall find</p>
<p>By every syllable a faithful verity 1276 .</p>
<p>The duke comes home tomorrow — nay, dry your eyes —</p>
<p>One of our convent, and his confessor 1277 ,</p>
<p>Gives me this instance 1278 . Already he hath carried</p>
<p>Notice to Escalus and Angelo,</p>
<p>Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,</p>
<p>There to give up their power. If you can, pace 1279 your wisdom</p>
<p>In that good path 1280 that I would wish it go,</p>
<p>And you shall have your bosom on 1281 this wretch,</p>
<p>Grace 1282 of the duke, revenges to your heart 1283 ,</p>
<p>And general honour.</p>
<p>ISABELLA I am directed by you.</p>
<p>DUKE This letter, then, to Friar Peter give,</p>
<p>Gives a letter</p>
<p>’Tis that he sent me of the duke’s return.</p>
<p>Say, by this token I desire his company</p>
<p>At Mariana’s house tonight. Her cause and yours</p>
<p>I’ll perfect him withal 1284 , and he shall bring you</p>
<p>Before the duke, and to the head of 1285 Angelo</p>
<p>Accuse him home and home 1286 . For my poor self,</p>
<p>I am combinèd 1287 by a sacred vow,</p>
<p>And shall be absent. Wend you 1288 with this letter:</p>
<p>Command these fretting waters 1289 from your eyes</p>
<p>With a light heart; trust not my holy order</p>
<p>If I pervert 1290 your course. Who’s here?</p>
<p>Enter Lucio</p>
<p>LUCIO Good even. Friar, where’s the provost?</p>
<p>DUKE Not within, sir.</p>
<p>LUCIO O, pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes
so red: thou must be patient. I am fain 1291 to dine and sup with water
and bran 1292 : I dare not for my head 1293 fill my belly. One fruitful
1294 meal would set me to’t 1295 . But they say the duke will be here
tomorrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother. If the old
fantastical 1296 duke of dark corners 1297 had been at home, he had
lived.</p>
<p>[Exit Isabella ]</p>
<p>DUKE Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding 1298 to your
reports, but the best is, he lives not in them 1299 .</p>
<p>LUCIO Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do. He’s a better
woodman 1300 than thou tak’st him for.</p>
<p>DUKE Well, you’ll answer this one day. Fare ye well.</p>
<p>Starts to go</p>
<p>LUCIO Nay, tarry, I’ll go along with thee. I can tell thee pretty
1301 tales of the duke.</p>
<p>DUKE You have told me too many of him already, sir, if they be true.
If not true, none were enough.</p>
<p>LUCIO I was once before him for getting a wench with child.</p>
<p>DUKE Did you such a thing?</p>
<p>LUCIO Yes, marry, did I, but I was fain to forswear 1302 it. They
would else have married me to the rotten medlar 1303 .</p>
<p>DUKE Sir, your company is fairer 1304 than honest. Rest you well.</p>
<p>LUCIO By my troth, I’ll go with thee to the lane’s end. If bawdy talk
offend you, we’ll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of
burr 1305 , I shall stick.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
