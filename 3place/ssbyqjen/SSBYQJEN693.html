<h4 id="scene-3-231-running-scene-3">Scene 3 231 / running scene 3</h4>
<p>Enter the King, Northumberland, Worcester, Hotspur, Sir Walter Blunt
and others</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV My blood hath been too cold and temperate 232 ,</p>
<p>Unapt 233 to stir at these indignities,</p>
<p>And you have found me 234 ; for accordingly</p>
<p>You tread upon 235 my patience. But be sure</p>
<p>I will from henceforth rather be myself 236 ,</p>
<p>Mighty and to be feared, than my condition 237 ,</p>
<p>Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,</p>
<p>And therefore lost that title of 238 respect</p>
<p>Which the proud 239 soul ne’er pays but to the proud.</p>
<p>WORCESTER Our house 240 , my sovereign liege, little deserves</p>
<p>The scourge 241 of greatness to be used on it.</p>
<p>And that same greatness too which our own hands</p>
<p>Have holp 242 to make so portly 243 .</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND My lord—</p>
<p>To the King</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Worcester, get thee gone, for I do see</p>
<p>Danger and disobedience in thine eye.</p>
<p>O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory 244 ,</p>
<p>And majesty might never yet endure</p>
<p>The moody frontier 245 246 of a servant brow.</p>
<p>You have good leave 247 to leave us. When we need</p>
<p>Your use 248 and counsel, we shall send for you.—</p>
<p>[Exit Worcester ]</p>
<p>You were about to speak.</p>
<p>To Northumberland</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Yea, my good lord.</p>
<p>Those prisoners in your highness’ name demanded,</p>
<p>Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,</p>
<p>Were, as he says, not with such strength denied 249</p>
<p>As was delivered 250 to your majesty,</p>
<p>Who either through envy or misprision 251</p>
<p>Was guilty of this fault and not my son.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR My liege, I did deny no prisoners.</p>
<p>To the King</p>
<p>But I remember, when the fight was done,</p>
<p>When I was dry with rage 252 and extreme toil,</p>
<p>Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,</p>
<p>Came there a certain lord, neat 253 and trimly 254 dressed,</p>
<p>Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reaped 255</p>
<p>Showed like a stubble-land at harvest-home 256 .</p>
<p>He was perfumèd like a milliner 257 ,</p>
<p>And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held</p>
<p>A pouncet-box 258 , which ever and anon 259</p>
<p>He gave 260 his nose and took’t away again,</p>
<p>Who therewith angry 261 , when it next came there,</p>
<p>Took it in snuff 262 . And still 263 he smiled and talked,</p>
<p>And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,</p>
<p>He called them untaught 264 knaves, unmannerly,</p>
<p>To bring a slovenly 265 unhandsome 266 corpse</p>
<p>Betwixt the wind and his nobility 267 .</p>
<p>With many holiday and lady terms 268</p>
<p>He questioned 269 me, among the rest demanded</p>
<p>My prisoners in your majesty’s behalf.</p>
<p>I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold 270 ,</p>
<p>To be so pestered with a popinjay 271 ,</p>
<p>Out of my grief 272 and my impatience,</p>
<p>Answered neglectingly 273 I know not what,</p>
<p>He should or should not. For he made me mad</p>
<p>To see him shine so brisk 274 and smell so sweet</p>
<p>And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman 275</p>
<p>Of guns and drums and wounds — God save the mark! 276 —</p>
<p>And telling me the sovereign’st 277 thing on earth</p>
<p>Was parmaceti 278 for an inward bruise,</p>
<p>And that it was great pity, so it was,</p>
<p>That villainous saltpetre 279 should be digged</p>
<p>Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,</p>
<p>Which many a good tall 280 fellow had destroyed</p>
<p>So cowardly, and but for these vile guns,</p>
<p>He would himself have been a soldier.</p>
<p>This bald unjointed chat 281 of his, my lord,</p>
<p>Made me to answer indirectly 282 , as I said,</p>
<p>And I beseech 283 you let not this report</p>
<p>Come current 284 for an accusation</p>
<p>Betwixt my love and your high majesty.</p>
<p>BLUNT The circumstance considered, good my lord,</p>
<p>To the king</p>
<p>Whatever Harry Percy then had said</p>
<p>To such a person and in such a place,</p>
<p>At such a time, with all the rest retold 285 ,</p>
<p>May reasonably die 286 and never rise</p>
<p>To do him wrong or any way impeach 287</p>
<p>What then he said, so 288 he unsay it now.</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Why, yet he 289 doth deny 290 his prisoners,</p>
<p>But with proviso and exception 291 ,</p>
<p>That we at our own charge 292 shall ransom straight 293</p>
<p>His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,</p>
<p>Who, in my soul, hath wilfully betrayed</p>
<p>The lives of those that he did lead to fight</p>
<p>Against the great magician, damned Glendower,</p>
<p>Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March 294</p>
<p>Hath lately married. Shall our coffers 295 , then,</p>
<p>Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?</p>
<p>Shall we buy treason, and indent 296 with fears 297</p>
<p>When they have lost and forfeited themselves?</p>
<p>No, on the barren mountain let him starve,</p>
<p>For I shall never hold that man my friend</p>
<p>Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost</p>
<p>To ransom home revolted 298 Mortimer.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Revolted Mortimer?</p>
<p>He never did fall off 299 , my sovereign liege,</p>
<p>But by the chance of war. To prove that true</p>
<p>Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,</p>
<p>Those mouthèd 300 wounds, which valiantly he took</p>
<p>When on the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank 301 ,</p>
<p>In single opposition, hand to hand,</p>
<p>He did confound 302 the best part of an hour</p>
<p>In changing hardiment 303 with great Glendower.</p>
<p>Three times they breathed 304 and three times did they drink,</p>
<p>Upon agreement 305 , of swift Severn’s flood 306 ;</p>
<p>Who then, affrighted 307 with their bloody looks,</p>
<p>Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,</p>
<p>And hid his crisp 308 head in the hollow 309 bank,</p>
<p>Bloodstainèd with these valiant combatants.</p>
<p>Never did base and rotten policy 310</p>
<p>Colour 311 her working with such deadly wounds;</p>
<p>Nor never could the noble Mortimer</p>
<p>Receive so many, and all willingly.</p>
<p>Then let him not be slandered 312 with revolt 313 .</p>
<p>KING HENRY IV Thou dost belie 314 him, Percy, thou dost belie
him;</p>
<p>He never did encounter 315 with Glendower.</p>
<p>I tell thee, he durst 316 as well have met the devil alone</p>
<p>As Owen Glendower for an enemy.</p>
<p>Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth</p>
<p>Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer.</p>
<p>Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,</p>
<p>Or you shall hear in such a kind 317 from me</p>
<p>As will displease ye.— My lord Northumberland,</p>
<p>We license 318 your departure with your son.—</p>
<p>Send us your prisoners, or you’ll hear of it.</p>
<p>To Hotspur</p>
<p>Exeunt King [Henry, Blunt and train ]</p>
<p>HOTSPUR An if 319 the devil come and roar for them</p>
<p>I will not send them. I will after 320 straight</p>
<p>And tell him so, for I will ease my heart,</p>
<p>Although it be with hazard of 321 my head.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND What? Drunk with choler 322 ? Stay and pause
awhile.</p>
<p>Here comes your uncle.</p>
<p>Enter Worcester</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Speak of Mortimer?</p>
<p>Yes, I will speak of him, and let my soul</p>
<p>Want mercy 323 , if I do not join with him.</p>
<p>In his behalf I’ll empty all these veins,</p>
<p>And shed my dear blood drop by drop i’th’dust,</p>
<p>But I will lift the downfall 324 Mortimer</p>
<p>As high i’th’air as this unthankful king,</p>
<p>As this ingrate 325 and cankered 326 Bullingbrook 327 .</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.</p>
<p>WORCESTER Who struck this heat 328 up after I was gone?</p>
<p>HOTSPUR He will, forsooth 329 , have all my prisoners.</p>
<p>And when I urged 330 the ransom once again</p>
<p>Of my wife’s brother, then his cheek looked pale,</p>
<p>And on my face he turned an eye of death 331 ,</p>
<p>Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.</p>
<p>WORCESTER I cannot blame him: was he 332 not proclaimed</p>
<p>By Richard 333 , that dead is, the next of blood 334 ?</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND He was. I heard the proclamation.</p>
<p>And then it was when the unhappy 335 king —</p>
<p>Whose wrongs in us 336 God pardon! — did set forth</p>
<p>Upon his Irish expedition,</p>
<p>From whence he intercepted 337 did return</p>
<p>To be deposed and shortly murderèd.</p>
<p>WORCESTER And for whose death we in the world’s wide mouth</p>
<p>Live scandalized and foully spoken of.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR But soft 338 , I pray you; did King Richard then</p>
<p>Proclaim my brother 339 Mortimer</p>
<p>Heir to the crown?</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND He did. Myself did hear it.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin 340 king,</p>
<p>That wished him on the barren mountains starved.</p>
<p>But shall it be that you that set the crown</p>
<p>Upon the head of this forgetful man</p>
<p>And for his sake wore the detested blot 341</p>
<p>Of murderous subornation 342 , shall it be,</p>
<p>That you a world of curses undergo,</p>
<p>Being the agents, or base second means 343 ,</p>
<p>The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?</p>
<p>O, pardon if that I descend so low,</p>
<p>To show the line 344 and the predicament 345</p>
<p>Wherein you range 346 under this subtle 347 king.</p>
<p>Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,</p>
<p>Or fill up chronicles in time to come,</p>
<p>That men of your nobility and power</p>
<p>Did gage 348 them both in an unjust behalf,</p>
<p>As both of you — God pardon it! — have done,</p>
<p>To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,</p>
<p>And plant this thorn, this canker 349 , Bullingbrook?</p>
<p>And shall it in more shame be further spoken,</p>
<p>That you are fooled 350 , discarded and shook off</p>
<p>By him for whom these shames ye underwent?</p>
<p>No. Yet time serves wherein you may redeem</p>
<p>Your banished honours and restore yourselves</p>
<p>Into the good thoughts of the world again,</p>
<p>Revenge the jeering and disdained contempt</p>
<p>Of this proud king, who studies 351 day and night</p>
<p>To answer 352 all the debt he owes unto you</p>
<p>Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:</p>
<p>Therefore, I say—</p>
<p>WORCESTER Peace, cousin, say no more.</p>
<p>And now I will unclasp 353 a secret book,</p>
<p>And to your quick-conceiving 354 discontents</p>
<p>I’ll read you matter deep 355 and dangerous,</p>
<p>As full of peril and adventurous spirit</p>
<p>As to o’er-walk 356 a current roaring loud</p>
<p>On the unsteadfast 357 footing of a spear 358 .</p>
<p>HOTSPUR If he fall in, goodnight 359 , or sink or swim 360 .</p>
<p>Send danger from the east unto the west,</p>
<p>So 361 honour cross 362 it from the north to south,</p>
<p>And let them grapple. The blood more stirs</p>
<p>To rouse a lion than to start a hare!</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Imagination of some great exploit</p>
<p>To Worcester</p>
<p>Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,</p>
<p>To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,</p>
<p>Or dive into the bottom of the deep,</p>
<p>Where fathom-line 363 could never touch the ground,</p>
<p>And pluck up drownèd honour by the locks,</p>
<p>So he that doth redeem 364 her thence 365 might wear</p>
<p>Without corrival 366 , all her dignities:</p>
<p>But out upon 367 this half-faced fellowship 368 !</p>
<p>WORCESTER He apprehends 369 a world of figures 370 here,</p>
<p>To Northumberland</p>
<p>But not the form 371 of what he should attend 372 .—</p>
<p>Good cousin, give me audience for a while and list 373 to me.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR I cry you mercy 374 .</p>
<p>WORCESTER Those same noble Scots</p>
<p>That are your prisoners —</p>
<p>HOTSPUR I’ll keep them all.</p>
<p>By heaven, he shall not have a Scot 375 of them.</p>
<p>No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not.</p>
<p>I’ll keep them, by this hand.</p>
<p>WORCESTER You start away</p>
<p>And lend no ear unto my purposes.</p>
<p>Those prisoners you shall keep.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Nay, I will; that’s flat.</p>
<p>He said he would not ransom Mortimer,</p>
<p>Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer,</p>
<p>But I will find him when he lies asleep,</p>
<p>And in his ear I’ll holla 376 ‘Mortimer!’</p>
<p>Nay, I’ll have a starling shall be taught to speak</p>
<p>Nothing but ‘Mortimer’, and give it him</p>
<p>To keep his anger still 377 in motion.</p>
<p>WORCESTER Hear you, cousin, a word.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR All studies here I solemnly defy 378 ,</p>
<p>Save how to gall and pinch 379 this Bullingbrook.</p>
<p>And that same sword-and-buckler 380 381 Prince of Wales,</p>
<p>But that 382 I think his father loves him not</p>
<p>And would be glad he met with some mischance 383 ,</p>
<p>I would have poisoned him with a pot of ale.</p>
<p>WORCESTER Farewell, kinsman. I’ll talk to you</p>
<p>When you are better tempered to attend 384 .</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Why, what a wasp-tongued and impatient fool</p>
<p>To Hotspur</p>
<p>Art thou to break into this woman’s mood,</p>
<p>Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own 385 !</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Why, look you, I am whipped and scourged with rods,</p>
<p>Nettled and stung with pismires 386 , when I hear</p>
<p>Of this vile politician 387 , Bullingbrook.</p>
<p>In Richard’s time — what d’ye call the place? —</p>
<p>A plague upon’t, it is in Gloucestershire,</p>
<p>’Twas where the madcap duke his uncle 388 kept 389 ,</p>
<p>His uncle York, where I first bowed my knee</p>
<p>Unto this king of smiles, this Bullingbrook,</p>
<p>When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh 390 .</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND At Berkeley Castle 391 .</p>
<p>HOTSPUR You say true.</p>
<p>Why, what a candy deal 392 of courtesy</p>
<p>This fawning greyhound then did proffer me.</p>
<p>‘Look when 393 his infant fortune came to age 394’,</p>
<p>And ‘gentle Harry Percy’ and ‘kind cousin’.—</p>
<p>O, the devil take such cozeners 395 ! — God forgive me,</p>
<p>To Worcester</p>
<p>Good uncle, tell your tale, for I have done.</p>
<p>WORCESTER Nay, if you have not, to’t again,</p>
<p>We’ll stay 396 your leisure.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR I have done, in sooth 397 .</p>
<p>WORCESTER Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.</p>
<p>Deliver them up without their ransom straight,</p>
<p>And make the Douglas’ son 398 your only mean</p>
<p>For powers 399 in Scotland, which, for divers 400 reasons</p>
<p>Which I shall send you written, be assured</p>
<p>Will easily be granted.— You, my lord,</p>
<p>To Northumberland</p>
<p>Your son in Scotland being thus employed,</p>
<p>Shall secretly into the bosom 401 creep</p>
<p>Of that same noble prelate 402 well beloved,</p>
<p>The archbishop.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Of York, is’t not?</p>
<p>WORCESTER True, who bears hard 403</p>
<p>His brother’s death at Bristol, the lord Scroop 404 .</p>
<p>I speak not this in estimation 405 ,</p>
<p>As what I think might be, but what I know</p>
<p>Is ruminated, plotted and set down,</p>
<p>And only stays 406 but to behold the face</p>
<p>Of that occasion 407 that shall bring it on.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR I smell it 408 :</p>
<p>Upon my life, it will do wondrous well.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Before the game’s afoot, thou still let’st slip 409
.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot.</p>
<p>And then the power 410 of Scotland and of York,</p>
<p>To join with Mortimer, ha?</p>
<p>WORCESTER And so they shall.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR In faith, it is exceedingly well aimed 411 .</p>
<p>WORCESTER And ’tis no little reason bids us speed,</p>
<p>To save our head 412 s by raising of a head.</p>
<p>For, bear ourselves as even 413 as we can,</p>
<p>The king will always think him in our debt,</p>
<p>And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,</p>
<p>Till he hath found a time to pay us home 414 .</p>
<p>And see already how he doth begin</p>
<p>To make us strangers to his looks of love.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR He does, he does. We’ll be revenged on him.</p>
<p>WORCESTER Cousin, farewell. No further go in this</p>
<p>Than I by letters shall direct your course.</p>
<p>When time is ripe, which will be suddenly 415 ,</p>
<p>I’ll steal 416 to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,</p>
<p>Where you and Douglas and our powers at once 417 ,</p>
<p>As I will fashion it, shall happily 418 meet,</p>
<p>To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,</p>
<p>Which now we hold at much uncertainty.</p>
<p>NORTHUMBERLAND Farewell, good brother. We shall thrive, I trust.</p>
<p>HOTSPUR Uncle, adieu. O, let the hours be short</p>
<p>Till fields 419 and blows and groans applaud our sport!</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
