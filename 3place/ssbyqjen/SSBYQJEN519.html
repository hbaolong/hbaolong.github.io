<h4 id="introduction-to-the-tragedy-of-king-lear">Introduction to The
Tragedy of King Lear</h4>
<p>Written soon after King James united the thrones of England and
Scotland, and performed in his royal presence at Whitehall, King Lear
reveals the dire consequences of dividing a united kingdom. In
principle, the aged Lear’s decision to take voluntary retirement does
not seem a bad thing: he is losing his grip on matters of state, his
daughters and sons-in-law are ‘younger strengths’ with more energy for
government, and, most importantly, the division is intended to prevent a
future civil war between rival claimants, which would have been a
definite possibility in the absence of a son who would automatically
inherit the whole kingdom. But can an anointed king abnegate his role at
will? If he does, he certainly should not expect to retain the trappings
of power. Goneril and Regan have a case for stripping him of his rowdy,
extravagant retinue of one hundred knights.</p>
<p>Lear’s mistake is to link the division of the kingdom to a public
show of affection. The two older sisters, well versed in the ‘glib and
oily art’ of courtly flattery, tell him what he wants to hear, but
Cordelia cannot. She is one of the play’s truth-tellers and simply lacks
the capacity or the experience to dress her love in fine rhetoric. Lear
knows that she loves him best, but we may assume that until this moment
her love has always been expressed privately. As the youngest and
unmarried daughter, Cordelia has probably never spoken publicly before
the court. Lear’s intention for the opening scene is that it will be
Cordelia’s coming-out: she is supposed to give public expression to her
great love and in return she will be rewarded with the richest portion
of the kingdom and the most-prized husband. He does not bargain on her
inability to play the role in which he has cast her. Kings and earls do
not necessarily have to be blind to true virtue – witness the examples
of Kent and France – but Lear, too long used to having his own way and
hearing only the words of flatterers, has blinded himself. Only when he
has been stripped of the fine clothes and fine words of the court, and
has heard truth in the mouths of a fool and a (supposed) Bedlam beggar,
does he find out what it really means to be human.</p>
<p>Where Macbeth and Othello are focused tightly upon a single plot
line, the action of Lear greatly extends the technique of parallel
plotting with which Shakespeare had experimented in Hamlet , where
Laertes and Fortinbras serve as foils to the hero. In Lear , the
Gloucester family plot is a sustained presence. Gloucester is another
father who is blind to the true nature of his children; that blindness
leads, in Shakespeare’s cruellest literalization of metaphor, to the
plucking out of his eyes. Edmund corresponds to the wicked daughters;
several of the play’s many letters pass between them. It is wholly
appropriate that he should end up promised to them both. Like the king’s
favourite daughter Cordelia, Edgar (who is the king’s godson) is
unjustly exiled from home and excluded from parental care. It is fitting
to the parallel structure of the twin plots that the play ends in the
Folio version with him returning to take the reins of power, just as
there is a certain, though very different, logic to Nahum Tate’s
infamous Restoration-period rewrite with a happy ending, in which Edgar
is married off to Cordelia.</p>
<p>Shakespeare never takes one side of a question. In the very opening
lines of the play we discover that it is Edmund who has previously been
unjustly exiled from home and excluded from parental care. Kent, the
play’s best judge of character, initially describes Edmund as ‘proper’:
he has the bearing of a gentleman, but his illegitimacy has deprived him
of the benefits of society. Edmund’s first soliloquy makes a good case
for the unfairness of a social order which practises primogeniture and
stigmatizes bastardy; his discovery near the moment of death that
‘Edmund was beloved’ is curiously touching. He is not, then, an
uncomplicated stage ‘machiavel’, an embodiment of pure, unmotivated
evil.</p>
<p>Astrology and astronomy were synonymous in the Elizabethan age: the
signs of the times were read in the signs of the skies. King Lear is a
play about bad times. The state drifts rudderless, child turns against
parent, the clouds of war gather, the king and all around him totter on
the brink of the abyss. So it is that Gloucester blames it all on the
stars: ‘These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us.’
Edmund, however, disputes this: ‘an admirable evasion of whoremaster
man, to lay his goatish disposition on the charge of a star!’ He argues
that things often regarded as the product of the ‘natural order’ are
actually shaped by ‘custom’ – for him, primogeniture and legitimacy
would come into this category. The position articulated here is close to
that of the sixteenth-century French essayist Michel de Montaigne in the
closing section of his Apology of Raymond Sebond : any custom abhorred
or outlawed by one nation is sure to be praised or practised by another.
But if you have nothing save custom, no divinely sanctioned hierarchy,
then where does your value-system come from? Montaigne’s answer is blind
faith in God, whereas Edmund, like an apologist before his time for the
political philosophy of Thomas Hobbes, commits himself to ‘nature’ as a
principle of survival and self-seeking.</p>
<p>Gloucester’s philosophical orientation, meanwhile, turns towards the
Stoic idea of finding the right timing for death. After his mock suicide
he says, ‘henceforth I’ll bear / Affliction till it do cry out itself
/’‘Enough, enough’’ and die.’ But he cannot sustain this position: when
Lear and Cordelia lose the battle, he is found in ‘ill thoughts again’,
wanting to rot. Edgar responds with more Stoic advice: ‘Men must endure
/ Their going hence, even as their coming hither: / Ripeness is all.’
But this idea of ripe timing doesn’t work out: by mistiming the
revelation of his own identity to Gloucester, Edgar precipitates his
father’s death.</p>
<p>The play’s pattern, then, is of Stoic comfort not working. At the
beginning of the fourth act Edgar reflects on his own condition and
cheers himself up with thoughts about the worst, but then his father
comes on blinded and he is instantly confounded – things are worse than
before. If the case of Edgar reveals the deficiency of Stoic comfort,
that of Albany demonstrates the inadequacy of belief in divine justice.
His credo is that the good shall taste ‘the wages of their virtue’ and
the bad drink from the poisoned ‘cup of their deservings’. This scheme
works for the bad, but not for the good. In the closing scene, Albany
tries to orchestrate events, to make order out of chaos, but each of his
resolutions is followed by new disaster: he greets the restored Edgar,
then immediately hears the news of Gloucester’s death, then the news of
the two queens’ deaths; then Kent comes on, dying; then in response to
the news that Cordelia is to be hanged, Albany says ‘The gods defend
her!’, only for Lear to enter with her in his arms already hanged. The
gods have not defended her. Then Albany tries to give power back to Lear
– and he promptly dies. Then he tries to persuade Kent and Edgar to
divide the kingdom, and Kent promptly goes off to die.</p>
<p>The final lines of the play – given to different speakers in the
Quarto and Folio versions of the text – suggest that the lesson has been
learnt that Stoic comfort will not do, that it is better to ‘speak what
we feel’ than ‘what we ought to say’. The Folio’s ascription of this
speech to Edgar makes more dramatic sense than the Quarto’s to Albany,
since Edgar’s stripping down in Act 3 is an exposure to feeling,
occurring in conjunction with Lear’s feeling with and for the poor,
which makes him the character better prepared to voice this
sentiment.</p>
<p>The Stoic philosopher tries to be ruled by reason rather than
passion. But for the great sixteenth-century humanist Desiderius Erasmus
in his Praise of Folly , there is inhumanity in the notion that to be
wise you must suppress the emotions. The most important thing is to
‘feel’ – as Gloucester has to learn, to see the world not rationally but
‘feelingly’. Erasmus’ Folly points out that friendship is among the
highest human values, and it depends on emotion. The people who show
friendship to Lear (Fool; Kent disguised as Caius; Edgar disguised as
Poor Tom and then as Peasant) and to Gloucester (Servants, Old Man) are
not the wise or the rich.</p>
<p>We are ruled by our passions and our bodies; we go through life
performing a series of different roles of which we are by no means in
control. ‘All this life of mortal men, what is it else but a certain
kind of stage play?’ asks Erasmus’ Folly. Lear echoes the sentiment:
‘When we are born, we cry that we are come / To this great stage of
fools.’ In the great theatre of the world, with the gods as audience, we
are the fools on stage. Under the aspect of Folly, we see that a king is
no different from any other man. The trappings of monarchy are but a
costume: this is both Folly’s and Lear’s discovery.</p>
<p>The play ends on a note of apocalypse, millennial doom. A trumpet
sounds three times to announce the final showdown. Then when Lear enters
with his beloved daughter dead in his arms, loyal Kent asks ‘Is this the
promised end?’ He is thinking of Doomsday, but the line is also a sly
allusion on Shakespeare’s part: in all previous versions of the Lear
story, several of which would have been familiar to members of his
audience, Cordelia survives and Lear is restored to the throne. The
death of Cordelia is all the more painful because it is not the end
‘promised’ by previous literary and theatrical tradition.</p>
<p>King Lear is a play full of questions. The big ones go unanswered.
The biggest of all is Lear’s ‘Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have
life, / And thou no breath at all?’ In this world, there is no rhyme or
reason, no pattern of divine justice. Here again, Shakespeare departs
strikingly from his source, the old anonymous play of King Leir , in
which Christian providence prevails. Shakespeare reimagines his material
in a bleak pagan world. In this, he not only looks back to the past, but
also anticipates a future that is ours – a time when the old religious
hierarchies and moral certainties have been stripped away.</p>
<p>But in a strange way an answer is to be found in Edgar’s reply to
Kent’s line about the promised end. A question is answered with a
question: ‘Or image of that horror?’ It’s not really the end of the
world; it’s an image of the end. Hamlet said that the player holds up a
mirror to nature, but in King Lear we are reminded again and again that
what you see in a mirror is an image, not the thing itself. Gloucester
doesn’t really jump off the cliff: it’s all an elaborate game, designed
by Edgar to teach his father a lesson. In uncertain times, we need
images, games and experiments as ways of trying to make sense of our
world. We need plays. That is why, four centuries on, we keep going back
to Shakespeare and his dazzling mirror-world in which everyone is a
player.</p>
<p>Looked at in one way, the world of King Lear , with its images of
doom, its mad king, its scheming ugly sisters, its fool and its
(pretend) mad Bedlam beggar, could not be further from ordinary life.
But looked at another way, it is an image of ordinary things, but seen
in extremity. It is a play that has more time for a language of ordinary
things – garden water-pots, wrens and toasted cheese – than for the glib
and oily art of courtly speech.</p>
<p>So is the whole play, like the ‘Dover cliff’ scene, an elaborate game
designed by Shakespeare to teach us a lesson? Only if we think of it as
a lesson in feeling, not high-minded judgement. To be truly responsive
to the play we must, as the final speech has it, ‘Speak what we feel,
not what we ought to say.’ To be human is to see feelingly , not to fall
back on easy moralizing, the ‘ought to say’ that characterizes people
like Albany. And seeing feelingly has to do with our sympathetic
response to the images that confront us, both on the stage and in the
great theatre of the world. Lear becomes human when he stops caring
about one kind of image (the glorious trappings of monarchy) and instead
confronts another: the image of raw human being, of a fool and a Bedlam
beggar, of poor naked wretches. Come the last trump, the play tells us,
we will be judged by our fellow-feeling for the dispossessed, not our
status in society. In this, as in so much else, Shakespeare speaks not
only for his own age, but for ours.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Lear, King of Britain, decides to abdicate and divide his
kingdom between his three daughters. When his beloved youngest,
Cordelia, refuses to make a public declaration of love for her father
she is disinherited and married to the King of France without a dowry.
The Earl of Kent is banished by Lear for daring to defend her. The two
elder daughters, Goneril and Regan, and their husbands inherit the
kingdom. Gloucester, deceived by his bastard son Edmund, disinherits his
legitimate son, Edgar, who is forced to go on the run to save his life.
Lear, now stripped of his power, quarrels with Goneril and Regan about
the conditions of his lodging in their households. In a rage he goes out
into the stormy night, accompanied by his Fool and by Kent, now
disguised as a servant. They encounter Edgar, disguised as a mad beggar
called ‘Poor Tom’. Gloucester is betrayed by Edmund and captured by
Regan and Cornwall, who put out his eyes. King Lear is taken secretly to
Dover, where Cordelia has landed with a French army. The blind
Gloucester meets but does not recognize Edgar, who leads him to Dover.
Lear and Cordelia are reconciled, but in the ensuing battle are captured
by the sisters’ forces. Goneril and Regan are both in love with Edmund,
who encourages them both. Discovering this, Goneril’s husband Albany
forces Edmund to defend himself against the charge of treachery. A
knight appears to challenge Edmund and, after fatally wounding him,
reveals himself to be Edgar. News comes that Goneril has poisoned Regan
and then committed suicide. Before dying, Edmund reveals that he has
ordered the deaths of Lear and Cordelia.</p>

were published in 1603.</p>
<p>SOURCES: Based on The True Chronicle Historie of King Leir and his
Three Daughters , an old play of unknown authorship that was in the
London theatrical repertoire in the early 1590s, but makes many changes,
including alteration of providential Christian to pagan language and the
introduction of a tragic ending. The Lear story also appeared in other
sources familiar to Shakespeare: The Mirrour for Magistrates (edition of
1574), Holinshed’s Chronicles (1587), and book 2 canto 10 of Edmund
Spenser’s epic poem The Faerie Queene (1590). In all versions of the
story before Shakespeare’s, there is a ‘romance’ ending whereby the old
king is restored to his daughter Cordelia and to the throne. The
Gloucester sub-plot is derived from the story of the Paphlagonian king
in book 2 chapter 10 of The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia by Sir Philip
Sidney (1590): a blind old man is led to the top of a cliff from where
he contemplates suicide because he has been deceived by his bastard son;
the good son returns and encounters the bad one in a chivalric duel. The
story was intended to exemplify both ‘true natural goodness’ and
‘wretched ungratefulness’; a few chapters later (2.15), Sidney tells of
a different credulous king who is tricked into mistrusting his virtuous
son. The characters of ‘Poor Tom’ and the Fool are entirely
Shakespearean creations, though some of the language of demonic
possession feigned by Edgar is borrowed from Samuel Harsnett’s
Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures (1603), a work of propaganda
about Catholic plots and faked exorcisms which Shakespeare probably read
because of the Stratford origins of one of the exorcizing priests,
Robert Debdale. The language of the play and some of its philosophical
ideas reveal that Shakespeare had also been reading The Essayes of
Montaigne in John Florio’s English translation (1603).</p>
<p>TEXT: Published in Quarto in 1608 under the title M. William
Shak-speare: HIS True Chronicle Historie of the life and death of King
LEAR and his three Daughters. With the vnfortunate life of Edgar, sonne
and heire to the Earle of Gloster, and his sullen and assumed humor of
TOM of Bedlam: As it was played before the Kings Maiestie at Whitehall
vpon S. Stephans night in Christmas Hollidayes. By his Maiesties
seruants playing vsually at the Gloabe on the Bancke-side . This text
was very poorly printed, partly because its printer (Nicholas Okes) was
unaccustomed to setting plays and also because it seems to derive from
Shakespeare’s own working manuscript, which would have been difficult to
read. Quarto includes about 300 lines that are not in the 1623 Folio
text, which was entitled ‘The Tragedy of King Lear’ and has clear signs
of derivation from the theatrical playbook (though, to complicate
matters, the Folio printing was also influenced by a reprint of the
Quarto that appeared in 1619 as one of the ten plays published by Thomas
Pavier in an attempt to produce a collected Shakespeare). The Folio in
turn has about 100 lines that are not in the Quarto, and nearly 1000
lines have variations of word or phrase. The two early texts thus
represent two different stages in the life of the play, with extensive
revision having been carried out, either systematically or
incrementally. Revisions include diminution of the prominence given to
the invading French army (perhaps for political reasons), clarification
of Lear’s motives for dividing his kingdom, and weakening of the role of
Albany (including reassignment from him to Edgar of the play’s closing
speech, and thus by implication – since it was a convention of
Shakespearean tragedy that the new man in power always has the last word
– of the right to rule Britain). Among the more striking cuts are the
mock trial of Goneril in the hovel and the moment of compassion when
loyal servants apply a palliative to Gloucester’s bleeding eyes. For
centuries, editors have conflated the Quarto and Folio texts, creating a
play that Shakespeare never wrote. We endorse the body of scholarship
since the 1980s and the new editorial tradition in which Folio and
Quarto are regarded as discrete entities. We have edited the more
theatrical Folio text, but have corrected its errors (which are
plentiful, since much of it was set in type by ‘Compositor E’, the
apprentice who was by far the worst printer in Isaac Jaggard’s shop).
The influence of Quarto copy on the Folio is of great assistance in
making these corrections. Textual notes are perforce more numerous than
for any other work by Shakespeare; several hundred Quarto variants are
listed. All the most significant Quarto-only passages are printed at the
end of the play.</p>
