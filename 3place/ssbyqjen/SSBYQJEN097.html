<h4 id="introduction-to-the-comedy-of-errors">Introduction to The Comedy
of Errors</h4>
<p>A merchant of Syracuse has identical twin sons. One is stolen at the
age of seven. The other’s name is changed to that of the lost boy, in
his memory. When grown up, he wanders the Mediterranean in search of his
brother, finally chancing upon the seaport where the latter lives. The
wanderer encounters the mistress, the wife and other acquaintances of
the brother and is inevitably mistaken for him. When he denies all
knowledge of the people who greet him, they assume that he is mad and
attempt to have him locked up – save that by a further confusion they
apprehend the other twin, the one who does know them. The audience
awaits the moment of resolution that will come when the twins appear on
stage together.</p>
<p>Such is the plot of Plautus’ Menaechmi , a Roman comedy familiar to
any Elizabethan with a classical education – which is to say any young
man who had been to university and many who had reached no further than
the upper level of grammar school. When The Comedy of Errors was
performed before an audience of London lawyers and their patrons in the
Christmas festivities of 1594, it was instantly recognized as being
‘like to Plautus his Menaechmus’ . Some years later, a lawyer named John
Manningham made the same link, describing Twelfth Night , Shakespeare’s
later comedy of twins and mistaken identity, as ‘much like The Comedy of
Errors or Menaechmi in Plautus’. Whilst we applaud difference,
Shakespeare’s first audiences favoured likeness: a work was good not
because it was original, but because it resembled an admired classical
exemplar, which in the case of comedy meant a play by Terence or
Plautus.</p>
<p>Imitation was at the core of both education and artistic theory in
Shakespeare’s world. But good imitation was never slavish: it
necessitated a surpassing of the original, often achieved by the fusion
of different sources or the complicating of an already complicated plot
line. Thus Shakespeare proved his cleverness to his audience of clever
young lawyers. It is as if he is saying: Plautus presented one pair of
identical twins, so I will give you two. The possibilities for confusion
are greatly multiplied by this device. As well as the stranger being
mistaken for the local man, and the local mistaken for the stranger, we
have the servants of each being mistaken by their own master and the
other’s master and the locals. Not to mention the masters mistaken by
their servants. The comedy whereby an unmarried man in an alien
environment is told that his wife is expecting him at home for dinner is
doubled by the comedy of his slave receiving the unlooked-for attentions
of the spherical kitchen-maid with whom his twin has been sexually
involved.</p>
<p>The Comedy of Errors turns on the essential device of farce: exits
and entrances. The wrong person keeps coming out of the door. Classical
comedy provided a model in which the action of a drama takes place in a
single location during the course of a single day. Errors is one of the
few Shakespearean plays to follow this convention. The entire action
takes place in the marketplace of Ephesus, its temporal structure framed
by the Egeon plot (condemned in the morning, released in the evening).
Unusually for Shakespeare, the exit and entrance doors represent
specific locations: the Phoenix (Antipholus’ and Adriana’s house), the
Porcupine (the courtesan’s house) and the Priory. They may even have
been labelled thus in performance. From the point of view of staging,
this device was well fitted to indoor academic drama – as the play’s
brevity was suited to its being but a small part of a longer evening’s
entertainment at the Inns of Court. Errors is by some margin the
shortest of Shakespeare’s plays. It has around 1800 lines; some of the
tragedies and histories are more than twice as long. There is no
surviving evidence of performance on the public stage, but this is no
guarantee that the play was kept in reserve for private performance to
elite audiences. The device of the doors could have been adapted for the
public theatres, perhaps with the upstage-centre ‘discovery space’
serving for the Priory in which the lost mother is found.</p>
<p>Though the Ephesian market economy is brought to life by means of
Angelo the goldsmith and various merchants, the largest parts in the
play belong to the strangers and the wife. The central comic device of
mistaken identity is a means to the discovery of identity. Meeting
someone who thinks you are someone you are not is a disturbing but
ultimately invaluable way of finding out who you really are. Antipholus
of Syracuse has been travelling in search of his family. On arriving in
Ephesus and being mistaken for his long-lost brother, he realizes that
his own self is not secure. His lines comparing himself to a drop of
water cut to the quick of that experience of wandering and wondering
which shapes so many of Shakespeare’s comedies. How can we reconcile the
self ’s conflicting need for autonomy (the single drop of water) and
community (the ocean)? The sense of loss and confusion prepare us for
the imagery of Ephesus as a mad world and the potential nightmare – the
reductio ad absurdum of farce – whereby we are led to imagine what it
would be like if everybody else were mad and we alone were sane and
therefore taken to be mad.</p>
<p>Comedy’s fond conclusion is that by finding the right partner we find
ourselves. Antipholus of Syracuse finds not only father, mother and
brother, but also future wife, in the form of Luciana, sister to his
brother’s wife. As in other early comedies such as The Taming of the
Shrew and The Two Gentlemen of Verona , there are two strong roles for
the boy actors in Shakespeare’s company. Whereas the two pairs of
brothers are identical twins, the sisters are of contrasting appearance
and character. Their names are indicative: ‘Adriana’ means of the earth
and ‘Luciana’ of the light; the former is brunette and the latter
blonde; the wife is perceived as shrewish and the sister as divinely
beautiful. But in the play’s most richly written speeches, Shakespeare
goes beyond the clichés of femininity suggested by these dualities.</p>
<p>As Shakespeare’s comedies variously suggest, happy endings are all
too often mere illusions or at best momentary suspensions of life’s
messiness. If we may assume that the twins are reasonably alike in
nature as well as identical in appearance, then there is a strong
possibility that in the imaginary afterlife of the action Antipholus’
marriage to Luciana, despite its sparky beginning, will end up all too
similar to his brother’s marriage to her sister. Whilst unmarried,
Luciana speaks in favour of wifely submission and accuses her sister of
shrewishness. But her sister has had to put up with a husband who
prefers to spend his time about town – not least in the company of a
courtesan – rather than at home with his wife. Most of Shakespeare’s
comedies are celebrations of courtship, but the married couples met
along the way are shaky role models. Once Luciana discovers what
husbands are really like, her theory will be sorely tested.</p>
<p>Adriana’s marriage is patched up at the end of the play, but there is
no undoing the pain she has expressed in the lines that turn Antipholus
of Syracuse’s self-centred image of the drop of water into an account of
how every action has consequences for those who love us. As so often,
Shakespeare has it both ways: Adriana delivers at one and the same time
the moving testimony of a neglected wife responding to her husband’s
sexual infidelity and the cue for the line that invariably wins the
play’s biggest laugh: ‘Plead you to me, fair dame?’ She is, of course,
confronting the wrong brother.</p>
<p>KEY FACTS</p>
<p>PLOT: Ephesus and Syracuse are at odds. Any Syracusan found in
Ephesus will be executed unless he can pay a ransom of a thousand marks.
Egeon, an old Syracusan merchant, has been arrested. He explains how he
has come to Ephesus: he and his wife Emilia had identical twin sons and
identical twin slaves, purchased for the purpose of serving the sons. In
a shipwreck many years ago, he was separated from his wife, one son and
one slave. The survivors are renamed in memory of the lost ones:
Antipholus for the son and Dromio for the slave. Once grown to manhood,
Antipholus of Syracuse, with his Dromio, had set off in search of his
brother and mother. Egeon is now in search of them. The Duke gives him
until evening to find the ransom money. By chance Antipholus and Dromio
of Syracuse have also just arrived in Ephesus. The other Antipholus and
Dromio have been living there since the wreck. And so the comedy of
errors ensues. The locals constantly mistake the visiting twins for the
natives – even Antipholus of Ephesus’ wife Adriana and her sister
Luciana are fooled. The confusions result in Antipholus of Ephesus being
arrested for debt and declared mad, while Antipholus of Syracuse take
refuge from his brother’s angry wife in a Priory – where the abbess
turns out to be Egeon’s long-lost wife. All is resolved and Egeon is
freed.</p>
<p>MAJOR PARTS: (with percentage of lines/number of speeches/scenes on
stage ) Antipholus of Syracuse (15%/103/6), Adriana (15%/79/6), Dromio
of Syracuse (14%/99/9), Antipholus of Ephesus (12%/76/4), Dromio of
Ephesus (9%/63/6), Egeon (8%/17/2), Luciana (5%/43/4), Duke Solinus
(5%/22/2), Angelo (4%/31/4), Emilia (4%/16/1).</p>
<p>LINGUISTIC MEDIUM: 85% verse, 15% prose. Fairly high incidence of
rhyme.</p>
<p>DATE: Performed at Gray’s Inn Christmas festivities for the legal
profession, 28 December 1594. Possibly written for this occasion, though
may have earlier date. Remained well known in legal circles and was
performed at court 28 December 1604.</p>
<p>SOURCES: The main plot of Syracusan merchant, lost twins and mistaken
identity is taken from Plautus’ Menaechmi (Roman, c.200 BC), known
either in Latin original or a manuscript translation by William Warner
(not published until 1595). The marital misunderstanding induced by the
mistaken identity of a slave, resulting in the master being shut out
from his own house, is taken from another Plautus play, Amphitruo . The
combination of two sets of identical twins is uniquely Shakespearean.
The shipwreck and lost/found parent motif may derive from the romance
tradition that dates back to the story of Apollonius of Tyre, which was
the main source for Shakespeare’s later (co-written) play, Pericles
.</p>
<p>TEXT: 1623 Folio is the only early text. It is generally thought to
have been set from Shakespeare’s original manuscript, but there is no
firm evidence for this – a transcript or (less likely) theatrical
promptbook is also possible. Generally good quality of printing.</p>
