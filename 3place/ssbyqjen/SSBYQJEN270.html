<h4 id="scene-5-running-scene-5">Scene 5 / running scene 5</h4>
<p>Enter Maria and Clown [Feste 187 ]</p>
<p>MARIA Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my
lips so wide as a bristle may enter in 188 way of thy excuse. My lady
will hang thee for thy absence.</p>
<p>FESTE Let her hang me: he that is well hanged 189 in this world needs
to fear no colours 190 .</p>
<p>MARIA Make that good 191 .</p>
<p>FESTE He shall see none to fear 192 .</p>
<p>MARIA A good lenten 193 answer. I can tell thee where that saying was
born, of ‘I fear no colours.’</p>
<p>FESTE Where, good Mistress Mary?</p>
<p>MARIA In the wars, and that may you be bold 194 to say in your
foolery.</p>
<p>FESTE Well, God give them wisdom that have it, and those that are
fools, let them use their talents.</p>
<p>MARIA Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent, or, to be
turned away 195 , is not that as good as a hanging to you?</p>
<p>FESTE Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage 196 , and, for 197
turning away, let summer bear it out 198 .</p>
<p>MARIA You are resolute, then?</p>
<p>FESTE Not so, neither. But I am resolved on two points 199 .</p>
<p>MARIA That if one break, the other will hold, or if both break, your
gaskins 200 fall.</p>
<p>FESTE Apt 201 , in good faith, very apt. Well, go thy way. If Sir
Toby would leave drinking 202 , thou wert as witty a piece of Eve’s
flesh 203 as any in Illyria.</p>
<p>MARIA Peace, you rogue, no more o’that. Here comes my lady: make your
excuse wisely, you were best 204 .</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>Enter Lady Olivia with Malvolio 205 [and Attendants ]</p>
<p>FESTE Wit, an’t 206 be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those
wits, that think they have thee, do very oft prove fools, and I that am
sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus 207
? ‘Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.’—God bless thee, lady.</p>
<p>Aside</p>
<p>To Olivia</p>
<p>OLIVIA Takef the fool away.</p>
<p>To Attendants</p>
<p>FESTE Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Go to 208 , you’re a dry 209 fool. I’ll no more of you.
Besides, you grow dishonest 210 .</p>
<p>FESTE Two faults, Madonna 211 , that drink and good counsel will
amend. For give the dry 212 fool drink, then is the fool not dry: bid
the dishonest man mend 213 himself. If he mend, he is no longer
dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher 214 mend him. Anything that’s
mended is but patched 215 : virtue that transgresses is but patched with
sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue. If that this simple
216 syllogism 217 will serve, so 218 . If it will not, what remedy? As
there is no true cuckold 219 but calamity 220 , so beauty’s a flower 221
. The lady bade take away the fool: therefore, I say again, take her
away.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Sir, I bade them take away you.</p>
<p>FESTE Misprision 222 in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non facit
monachum 223 : that’s as much to say as I wear not motley 224 in my
brain. Good madonna, give me leave 225 to prove you a fool.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Can you do it?</p>
<p>FESTE Dexteriously 226 , good madonna.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Make your proof.</p>
<p>FESTE I must catechize 227 you for it, madonna. Good my mouse of
virtue 228 , answer me.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Well, sir, for want of other idleness 229 , I’ll bide 230 your
proof.</p>
<p>FESTE Good madonna, why mourn’st thou?</p>
<p>OLIVIA Good fool, for my brother’s death.</p>
<p>FESTE I think his soul is in hell, madonna.</p>
<p>OLIVIA I know his soul is in heaven, fool.</p>
<p>FESTE The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother’s soul being
in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.</p>
<p>OLIVIA What think you of this fool, Malvolio? Doth he not mend 231
?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him.
Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.</p>
<p>FESTE God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better
increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox 232 , but
he will not pass 233 his word for twopence that you are no fool.</p>
<p>OLIVIA How say you to that, Malvolio?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren 234
rascal. I saw him put down 235 the other day with 236 an ordinary fool
237 that has no more brain than a stone 238 . Look you now, he’s out of
his guard 239 already. Unless you laugh and minister occasion 240 to
him, he is gagged. I protest 241 , I take these wise men, that crow 242
so at these set 243 kind of fools, no better than the fools’ zanies 244
.</p>
<p>OLIVIA O, you are sick of 245 self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a
distempered 246 appetite. To be generous, guiltless and of free 247
disposition is to take those things for bird-bolts 248 that you deem
cannon-bullets. There is no slander in an allowed 249 fool, though he do
nothing but rail 250 ; nor no railing in a known discreet 251 man,
though he do nothing but reprove 252 .</p>
<p>FESTE Now Mercury endue thee with leasing 253 , for thou speak’st
well of fools.</p>
<p>Enter Maria</p>
<p>MARIA Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to
speak with you.</p>
<p>OLIVIA From the Count Orsino, is it?</p>
<p>MARIA I know not, madam. ’Tis a fair young man, and well
attended.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Who of my people hold him in delay?</p>
<p>MARIA Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Fetch him off, I pray you. He speaks nothing but madman 254 .
Fie 255 on him!—</p>
<p>[Exit Maria ]</p>
<p>Go you, Malvolio; if it be a suit from the count, I am sick, or not
at home. What you will 256 , to dismiss it.—</p>
<p>Exit Malvolio</p>
<p>Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old 257 , and people dislike
it.</p>
<p>FESTE Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should be
258 a fool, whose skull Jove 259 cram with brains, for — here he comes
—</p>
<p>Enter Sir Toby</p>
<p>one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater 260 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA By mine honour, half drunk.— What is he at the gate,
cousin?</p>
<p>To Sir Toby</p>
<p>SIR TOBY A gentleman.</p>
<p>OLIVIA A gentleman? What gentleman?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY ’Tis a gentleman here— a plague o’these pickle herring!— How
now, sot 261 ?</p>
<p>Belches/To Feste</p>
<p>FESTE Good Sir Toby!</p>
<p>OLIVIA Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy
262 ?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Lechery? I defy lechery. There’s one 263 at the gate.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Ay, marry, what is he?</p>
<p>SIR TOBY Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not. Give me faith
264 , say I. Well, it’s all one 265 .</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>OLIVIA What’s a drunken man like, fool?</p>
<p>FESTE Like a drowned man, a fool and a madman: one draught above heat
266 makes him a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns 267
him.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Go thou and seek the crowner 268 , and let him sit o’my coz
269 , for he’s in the third degree of drink: he’s drowned. Go look after
him.</p>
<p>FESTE He is but mad yet, madonna, and the fool shall look to the
madman.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>Enter Malvolio</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Madam, yond 270 young fellow swears he will speak with you.
I told him you were sick, he takes on him to understand 271 so much, and
therefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleep — he seems
to have a foreknowledge of that too — and therefore comes to speak with
you. What is to be said to him, lady? He’s fortified against any
denial.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Tell him he shall not speak with me.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO He’s been told so, and he says he’ll stand at your door like
a sheriff’s post 272 , and be the supporter to a bench 273 , but he’ll
speak with you.</p>
<p>OLIVIA What kind o’man is he?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Why, of mankind 274 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA What manner of man?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Of very ill manner 275 . He’ll speak with you, will you or
no 276 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA Of what personage 277 and years is he?</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy. As
a squash 278 is before ’tis a peascod, or a codling 279 when ’tis almost
an apple: ’tis with him in standing water 280 , between boy and man. He
is very well-favoured 281 and he speaks very shrewishly 282 . One would
think his mother’s milk were scarce out of him.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Gentlewoman, my lady calls.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>Enter Maria</p>
<p>OLIVIA Give me my veil. Come, throw it o’er my face. We’ll once more
hear Orsino’s embassy 283 .</p>
<p>She is veiled</p>
<p>Enter Viola [and Attendants ]</p>
<p>VIOLA The honourable lady of the house, which is she?</p>
<p>OLIVIA Speak to me, I shall answer for her. Your will?</p>
<p>VIOLA Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty — I pray you
tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would
be loath to cast away 284 my speech, for besides that it is excellently
well penned 285 , I have taken great pains to con 286 it. Good beauties,
let me sustain 287 no scorn; I am very comptible 288 , even to the least
sinister 289 usage.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Whence came you, sir?</p>
<p>VIOLA I can say little more than I have studied 290 , and that
question’s out of my part 291 . Good gentle one, give me modest 292
assurance, if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my
speech.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Are you a comedian 293 ?</p>
<p>VIOLA No, my profound heart 294 . And yet, by the very fangs of
malice, I swear I am not that I play 295 . Are you the lady of the
house?</p>
<p>OLIVIA If I do not usurp 296 myself, I am.</p>
<p>VIOLA Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself, for what
is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve 297 . But this is from 298 my
commission 299 . I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show
you the heart of my message.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Come to what is important in’t. I forgive 300 you the
praise.</p>
<p>VIOLA Alas, I took great pains to study it, and ’tis poetical.</p>
<p>OLIVIA It is the more like to be feigned 301 . I pray you keep it in
302 . I heard you were saucy 303 at my gates, and allowed your approach
rather to wonder 304 at you than to hear you. If you be not mad, be
gone. If you have reason, be brief 305 . ’Tis not that time of moon with
me 306 to make one 307 in so skipping 308 a dialogue.</p>
<p>MARIA Will you hoist sail 309 , sir? Here lies your way.</p>
<p>VIOLA No, good swabber 310 , I am to hull 311 here a little longer.
Some mollification 312 for your giant 313 , sweet lady; tell me your
mind, I am a messenger.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the
courtesy 314 of it is so fearful 315 . Speak your office 316 .</p>
<p>VIOLA It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture 317 of war, no
taxation of homage 318 ; I hold the olive 319 in my hand. My words are
as full of peace as matter 320 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA Yet you began rudely 321 . What are you? What would you?</p>
<p>VIOLA The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from my
entertainment 322 . What I am, and what I would, are as secret as
maidenhead 323 : to your ears, divinity 324 : to any other’s,
profanation 325 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA Give us the place alone. We will hear this divinity.</p>
<p>[Exeunt Maria and Attendants ]</p>
<p>Now, sir, what is your text 326 ?</p>
<p>VIOLA Most sweet lady—</p>
<p>OLIVIA A comfortable 327 doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where
lies your text?</p>
<p>VIOLA In Orsino’s bosom 328 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA In his bosom? In what chapter 329 of his bosom?</p>
<p>VIOLA To answer by the method 330 , in the first of his heart.</p>
<p>OLIVIA O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?</p>
<p>VIOLA Good madam, let me see your face.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my
face? You are now out of 331 your text. But we will draw the curtain 332
and show you the picture.</p>
<p>Unveils</p>
<p>Look you, sir, such a one I was this present 333 . Is’t not well
done?</p>
<p>VIOLA Excellently done, if God did all 334 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA ’Tis in grain 335 , sir, ’twill endure wind and weather.</p>
<p>VIOLA ’Tis beauty truly blent 336 , whose red and white 337</p>
<p>Nature’s own sweet and cunning 338 hand laid on.</p>
<p>Lady, you are the cruell’st she 339 alive,</p>
<p>If you will lead these graces 340 to the grave</p>
<p>And leave the world no copy 341 .</p>
<p>OLIVIA O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted. I will give out divers
schedules 342 of my beauty. It shall be inventoried 343 , and every
particle and utensil 344 labelled to my will: as, item , two lips,
indifferent 345 red: item , two grey eyes, with lids to them: item , one
neck, one chin and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise 346 me?</p>
<p>VIOLA I see you what you are, you are too proud.</p>
<p>But if 347 you were the devil, you are fair.</p>
<p>My lord and master loves you. O, such love</p>
<p>Could be but recompensed, though 348 you were crowned</p>
<p>The nonpareil 349 of beauty!</p>
<p>OLIVIA How does he love me?</p>
<p>VIOLA With adorations, fertile 350 tears,</p>
<p>With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Your lord does know my mind: I cannot love him.</p>
<p>Yet I suppose 351 him virtuous, know him noble,</p>
<p>Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;</p>
<p>In voices well divulged 352 , free 353 , learned and valiant,</p>
<p>And in dimension and the shape of nature 354</p>
<p>A gracious 355 person; but yet I cannot love him.</p>
<p>He might have took his answer long ago.</p>
<p>VIOLA If I did love you in my master’s flame 356 ,</p>
<p>With such a suff’ring, such a deadly 357 life,</p>
<p>In your denial I would find no sense,</p>
<p>I would not understand it.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Why, what would you?</p>
<p>VIOLA Make me a willow cabin 358 at your gate,</p>
<p>And call upon my soul 359 within the house,</p>
<p>Write loyal cantons 360 of contemnèd 361 love</p>
<p>And sing them loud even in the dead of night,</p>
<p>Hallow 362 your name to the reverberate 363 hills</p>
<p>And make the babbling gossip 364 of the air 365</p>
<p>Cry out ‘Olivia!’ O, you should not rest</p>
<p>Between the elements of air and earth,</p>
<p>But you should pity me!</p>
<p>OLIVIA You might do much. What is your parentage?</p>
<p>VIOLA Above my fortunes 366 , yet my state 367 is well 368 :</p>
<p>I am a gentleman.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Get you to your lord.</p>
<p>I cannot love him. Let him send no more,</p>
<p>Unless, perchance, you come to me again,</p>
<p>To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:</p>
<p>I thank you for your pains. Spend this for me.</p>
<p>Offers a purse</p>
<p>VIOLA I am no fee’d post 369 , lady; keep your purse.</p>
<p>My master, not myself, lacks recompense.</p>
<p>Love make his heart of flint that you shall love 370 ,</p>
<p>And let your fervour, like my master’s, be</p>
<p>Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>OLIVIA ‘What is your parentage?’</p>
<p>’Above my fortunes, yet my state is well;</p>
<p>I am a gentleman.’ I’ll be sworn thou art.</p>
<p>Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,</p>
<p>Do give thee five-fold blazon 371 . Not too fast. Soft 372 ,
soft!</p>
<p>Unless the master were the man 373 374 . How now?</p>
<p>Even so quickly may one catch the plague 375 ?</p>
<p>Methinks I feel this youth’s perfections</p>
<p>With an invisible and subtle stealth</p>
<p>To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.</p>
<p>What ho, Malvolio!</p>
<p>Enter Malvolio</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Here, madam, at your service.</p>
<p>OLIVIA Run after that same peevish 376 messenger,</p>
<p>The county’s 377 man. He left this ring behind him,</p>
<p>Gives a ring</p>
<p>Would I 378 or not. Tell him I’ll none of it.</p>
<p>Desire 379 him not to flatter with 380 his lord,</p>
<p>Nor hold him up with hopes 381 . I am not for him.</p>
<p>If that the youth will come this way tomorrow,</p>
<p>I’ll give him reasons for’t. Hie 382 thee, Malvolio.</p>
<p>MALVOLIO Madam, I will.</p>
<p>Exit</p>
<p>OLIVIA I do I know not what, and fear to find</p>
<p>Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind 383 .</p>
<p>Fate, show thy force. Ourselves we do not owe 384 .</p>
<p>What is decreed must be, and be this so.</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>Act 2</p>
