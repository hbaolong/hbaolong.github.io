continues</h4>
<p>Enter King John, King Philip, Lewis, Blanche, Queen Elinor, the
Bastard [and ] Austria</p>
<p>KING PHILIP ’Tis true 719 , fair daughter 720 , and this blessèd
day</p>
<p>Ever in France shall be kept festival:</p>
<p>To solemnize this day the glorious sun</p>
<p>Stays in his course 721 and plays the alchemist 722 ,</p>
<p>Turning with splendour of his precious eye</p>
<p>The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold:</p>
<p>The yearly course that brings this day about</p>
<p>Shall never see it but a holy day 723 .</p>
<p>CONSTANCE A wicked day, and not a holy day!</p>
<p>Rising</p>
<p>What hath this day deserved? What hath it done,</p>
<p>That it in golden letters 724 should be set</p>
<p>Among the high tides 725 in the calendar?</p>
<p>Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,</p>
<p>This day of shame, oppression, perjury.</p>
<p>Or if it must stand still 726 , let wives with child 727</p>
<p>Pray that their burdens may not fall 728 this day,</p>
<p>Lest that their hopes prodigiously 729 be crossed 730 :</p>
<p>But 731 on this day let seamen fear no wreck 732 :</p>
<p>No bargains break that are not this day made 733 ;</p>
<p>This day all things begun come to ill end,</p>
<p>Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause</p>
<p>To curse the fair proceedings of this day:</p>
<p>Have I not pawned 734 to you my majesty 735 ?</p>
<p>CONSTANCE You have beguiled 736 me with a counterfeit</p>
<p>Resembling majesty, which, being touched and tried 737 ,</p>
<p>Proves valueless: you are forsworn 738 , forsworn:</p>
<p>You came in arms 739 to spill mine enemies’ blood,</p>
<p>But now in arms 740 you strengthen it with yours 741 .</p>
<p>The grappling vigour and rough frown of war</p>
<p>Is cold in amity and painted 742 peace,</p>
<p>And our 743 oppression hath made up 744 this league 745 :</p>
<p>Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!</p>
<p>A widow cries: be husband to me, heavens!</p>
<p>Let not the hours of this ungodly day</p>
<p>Wear out 746 the days 747 in peace; but, ere sun set,</p>
<p>Set armèd discord ’twixt these perjured kings:</p>
<p>Hear me, O, hear me!</p>
<p>AUSTRIA Lady Constance, peace!</p>
<p>CONSTANCE War, war, no peace! Peace is to me a war:</p>
<p>O Limoges 748 , O Austria, thou dost shame</p>
<p>That bloody spoil 749 750 : thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward:</p>
<p>Thou little valiant, great in villainy,</p>
<p>Thou ever strong upon the stronger side;</p>
<p>Thou Fortune’s champion 751 , that dost never fight</p>
<p>But when her humorous 752 ladyship is by 753</p>
<p>To teach thee safety 754 : thou art perjured too,</p>
<p>And sooth’st up greatness 755 . What a fool art thou,</p>
<p>A ramping 756 fool, to brag, and stamp, and swear</p>
<p>Upon my party 757 : thou cold-blooded slave,</p>
<p>Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side?</p>
<p>Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend</p>
<p>Upon thy stars, thy fortune, and thy strength,</p>
<p>And dost thou now fall over 758 to my foes?</p>
<p>Thou wear a lion’s hide! Doff 759 it for shame,</p>
<p>And hang a calf’s-skin 760 on those recreant 761 limbs.</p>
<p>AUSTRIA O, that a man should speak those words to me!</p>
<p>BASTARD And hang a calf’s-skin on those recreant limbs.</p>
<p>AUSTRIA Thou dar’st not say so, villain, for thy life.</p>
<p>BASTARD And hang a calf’s-skin on those recreant limbs.</p>
<p>KING JOHN We like not this: thou dost forget thyself.</p>
<p>Enter Pandulph 762</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Here comes the holy legate 763 of the Pope.</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven.—</p>
<p>To thee, King John, my holy errand is:</p>
<p>I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,</p>
<p>And from Pope Innocent 764 the legate here,</p>
<p>Do in his name religiously 765 demand</p>
<p>Why thou against the Church, our holy mother,</p>
<p>So wilfully dost spurn 766 ; and force perforce 767</p>
<p>Keep Stephen Langton 768 , chosen archbishop</p>
<p>Of Canterbury, from that holy see 769 :</p>
<p>This, in our foresaid 770 holy father’s name,</p>
<p>Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.</p>
<p>KING JOHN What earthy 771 name to interrogatories 772</p>
<p>Can test 773 the free breath of a sacred king?</p>
<p>Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name</p>
<p>So slight, unworthy, and ridiculous</p>
<p>To charge 774 me to an answer, as the Pope.</p>
<p>Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England</p>
<p>Add thus much more, that no Italian priest</p>
<p>Shall tithe 775 or toll 776 in our dominions:</p>
<p>But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,</p>
<p>So, under him, that great supremacy 777 ,</p>
<p>Where 778 we do reign, we will alone uphold 779</p>
<p>Without th’assistance of a mortal hand:</p>
<p>So tell the Pope, all reverence set apart 780</p>
<p>To him and his usurped authority.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Brother of England, you blaspheme 781 in this.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Though you and all the kings of Christendom</p>
<p>Are led so grossly 782 by this meddling priest 783 ,</p>
<p>Dreading the curse 784 that money may buy out 785 ,</p>
<p>And by the merit of vile 786 gold, dross 787 , dust,</p>
<p>Purchase corrupted pardon of 788 a man,</p>
<p>Who in that sale sells pardon from himself 789 :</p>
<p>Though you and all the rest so grossly led</p>
<p>This juggling 790 witchcraft with revenue cherish 791 ,</p>
<p>Yet I alone, alone do me oppose 792</p>
<p>Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes.</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH Then by the lawful power that I have,</p>
<p>Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate 793 :</p>
<p>And blessèd shall he be that doth revolt</p>
<p>From his allegiance to an heretic 794 :</p>
<p>And meritorious shall that hand be called,</p>
<p>Canonizèd and worshipped as a saint,</p>
<p>That takes away by any secret course</p>
<p>Thy hateful life.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE O, lawful let it be</p>
<p>That I have room 795 with Rome to curse awhile:</p>
<p>Good Father Cardinal, cry thou ‘Amen’</p>
<p>To my keen 796 curses; for without my wrong 797</p>
<p>There is no tongue hath power to curse him right 798 .</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH There’s law and warrant 799 , lady, for my
curse.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE And for mine too: when law can do no right,</p>
<p>Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong 800 :</p>
<p>Law cannot give my child his kingdom here;</p>
<p>For he that holds 801 his kingdom holds the law:</p>
<p>Therefore, since law itself is perfect 802 wrong,</p>
<p>How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH Philip of France, on peril of a curse,</p>
<p>Let go the hand of that arch-heretic 803 ,</p>
<p>And raise the power of France 804 upon his head 805 ,</p>
<p>Unless he do submit himself to Rome.</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR Look’st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE Look to that 806 , devil, lest that France repent,</p>
<p>And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.</p>
<p>AUSTRIA King Philip, listen to the cardinal.</p>
<p>BASTARD And hang a calf’s-skin on his recreant limbs.</p>
<p>AUSTRIA Well, ruffian, I must pocket up 807 these wrongs,</p>
<p>Because—</p>
<p>BASTARD Your breeches best may carry them.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Philip, what say’st thou to the cardinal?</p>
<p>CONSTANCE What should he say, but as the cardinal 808 ?</p>
<p>LEWIS Bethink you 809 , father, for the difference 810</p>
<p>Is purchase 811 of a heavy curse from Rome,</p>
<p>Or the light 812 loss of England for a friend:</p>
<p>Forgo the easier.</p>
<p>BLANCHE That’s the curse of Rome.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE O Lewis, stand fast: the devil tempts thee here</p>
<p>In likeness of a new untrimmèd 813 bride.</p>
<p>BLANCHE The lady Constance speaks not from her faith,</p>
<p>But from her need 814 .</p>
<p>CONSTANCE O, if thou grant my need,</p>
<p>Which only lives but by 815 the death of faith 816 ,</p>
<p>That need must needs 817 infer this principle,</p>
<p>That faith would live again by death of need:</p>
<p>O then tread down my need, and faith mounts up:</p>
<p>Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down.</p>
<p>KING JOHN The king is moved 818 , and answers not to this.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE O, be removed 819 from him, and answer well!</p>
<p>To King Philip</p>
<p>AUSTRIA Do so, King Philip, hang no more in doubt.</p>
<p>BASTARD Hang 820 nothing but a calf’s-skin, most sweet lout.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP I am perplexed, and know not what to say.</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,</p>
<p>If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Good reverend father, make my person yours 821 ,</p>
<p>And tell me how you would bestow yourself 822 .</p>
<p>This royal hand and mine are newly knit,</p>
<p>And the conjunction of our inward souls</p>
<p>Married in league, coupled and linked together</p>
<p>With all religious strength of sacred vows:</p>
<p>The latest 823 breath that gave the sound of words</p>
<p>Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love</p>
<p>Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,</p>
<p>And even 824 before this truce, but new 825 before,</p>
<p>No longer than we well could wash our hands</p>
<p>To clap 826 this royal bargain 827 up of peace,</p>
<p>Heaven knows, they were besmeared and overstained 828</p>
<p>With slaughter’s pencil 829 , where revenge did paint</p>
<p>The fearful 830 difference 831 of incensèd kings:</p>
<p>And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,</p>
<p>So newly joined in love, so strong in both,</p>
<p>Unyoke this seizure 832 and this kind regreet 833 ?</p>
<p>Play fast and loose 834 with faith, so 835 jest with heaven,</p>
<p>Make such unconstant 836 children of ourselves,</p>
<p>As now again to snatch our palm from palm?</p>
<p>Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed</p>
<p>Of smiling peace to march a bloody 837 host 838 ,</p>
<p>And make a riot on the gentle brow 839</p>
<p>Of true sincerity? O holy sir,</p>
<p>My reverend father, let it not be so:</p>
<p>Out of your grace, devise, ordain 840 , impose</p>
<p>Some gentle order, and then we shall be blest</p>
<p>To do your pleasure and continue friends.</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH All form is formless, order orderless,</p>
<p>Save what is opposite to England’s love.</p>
<p>Therefore to arms, be champion of our Church,</p>
<p>Or let the Church, our mother, breathe her curse,</p>
<p>A mother’s curse, on her revolting 841 son:</p>
<p>France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue 842 ,</p>
<p>A casèd 843 lion by the mortal 844 paw,</p>
<p>A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,</p>
<p>Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith 845 .</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH So mak’st thou faith 846 an enemy to faith,</p>
<p>And like a civil war set’st oath to 847 oath,</p>
<p>Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow</p>
<p>First made to heaven, first be to heaven performed,</p>
<p>That is, to be the champion of our Church:</p>
<p>What since 848 thou swor’st 849 is sworn against thyself,</p>
<p>And may not be performèd by thyself,</p>
<p>For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss</p>
<p>Is not amiss when it is truly done 850 :</p>
<p>And being not done, where doing tends to 851 ill,</p>
<p>The truth is then most done not doing it:</p>
<p>The better act 852 of purposes mistook 853</p>
<p>Is to mistake again 854 : though indirect 855 ,</p>
<p>Yet indirection thereby grows direct,</p>
<p>And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire</p>
<p>Within the scorchèd veins of one new burned 856 :</p>
<p>It is religion 857 that doth make vows kept,</p>
<p>But thou hast sworn against religion:</p>
<p>By what thou swear’st 858 against the thing thou swear’st,</p>
<p>And mak’st an oath the surety for thy truth 859</p>
<p>Against an oath the truth: thou art unsure 860</p>
<p>To swear, swears only not to be forsworn 861 ,</p>
<p>Else what a mockery should it be to swear?</p>
<p>But thou dost swear only to be forsworn,</p>
<p>And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear:</p>
<p>Therefore thy later vows against thy first</p>
<p>Is in thyself rebellion to thyself:</p>
<p>And better conquest never canst thou make</p>
<p>Than arm thy constant and thy nobler part 862 s</p>
<p>Against these giddy loose suggestions:</p>
<p>Upon which better part our prayers come in,</p>
<p>If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know</p>
<p>The peril of our curses light 863 on thee</p>
<p>So heavy as 864 thou shalt not shake them off,</p>
<p>But in despair die under their black 865 weight.</p>
<p>AUSTRIA Rebellion 866 , flat 867 rebellion!</p>
<p>BASTARD Will’t not be 868 ?</p>
<p>Will not a calf’s-skin stop 869 that mouth of thine?</p>
<p>LEWIS Father, to arms!</p>
<p>BLANCHE Upon thy wedding day?</p>
<p>Against the blood that thou hast marrièd 870 ?</p>
<p>What, shall our feast be kept 871 with slaughtered men?</p>
<p>Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,</p>
<p>Clamours of hell, be measures 872 to our pomp?</p>
<p>O husband, hear me: ay, alack, how new</p>
<p>Is ‘husband’ in my mouth! Even for that name,</p>
<p>Which till this time my tongue did ne’er pronounce,</p>
<p>Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms</p>
<p>Against mine uncle.</p>
<p>She may kneel here</p>
<p>CONSTANCE O, upon my knee made hard with kneeling,</p>
<p>She may kneel</p>
<p>I do pray to thee, thou virtuous dauphin,</p>
<p>Alter not the doom 873 forethought 874 by heaven.</p>
<p>BLANCHE Now shall I see thy love: what motive may</p>
<p>Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?</p>
<p>CONSTANCE That which upholdeth him that thee upholds 875 :</p>
<p>His honour:— O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!</p>
<p>To Lewis</p>
<p>LEWIS I muse 876 your majesty doth seem so cold,</p>
<p>To King Philip</p>
<p>When such profound respects 877 do pull you on.</p>
<p>CARDINAL PANDULPH I will denounce 878 a curse upon his head.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from 879
thee.</p>
<p>CONSTANCE O, fair return of banished majesty!</p>
<p>She may rise</p>
<p>QUEEN ELINOR O, foul revolt of French inconstancy!</p>
<p>KING JOHN France, thou shalt rue 880 this hour within this hour.</p>
<p>BASTARD Old Time the clock-setter, that bald 881 sexton Time,</p>
<p>Is it as he will? Well then, France shall rue.</p>
<p>BLANCHE The sun’s o’ercast with blood: fair day, adieu 882 !</p>
<p>Which is the side that I must go withal?</p>
<p>I am with both, each army hath a hand,</p>
<p>And in their rage, I having hold of both,</p>
<p>They whirl asunder and dismember 883 me.</p>
<p>Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win:—</p>
<p>Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose:—</p>
<p>Father 884 , I may not wish the fortune thine:—</p>
<p>Grandam, I will not wish thy wishes thrive:</p>
<p>Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose:</p>
<p>Assurèd loss before the match be played.</p>
<p>LEWIS Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.</p>
<p>He may help her rise</p>
<p>BLANCHE There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.</p>
<p>KING JOHN Cousin 885 , go draw our puissance 886 together.</p>
<p>[Exit the Bastard ]</p>
<p>France, I am burned up with inflaming wrath,</p>
<p>A rage whose heat hath this condition 887 :</p>
<p>That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,</p>
<p>The blood, and dearest-valued 888 blood, of France.</p>
<p>KING PHILIP Thy rage shall burn thee up, and thou shalt turn</p>
<p>To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire:</p>
<p>Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy.</p>
<p>KING JOHN No more than he that threats 889 . To arms let’s hie 890
!</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
