<h4 id="scene-1-1-running-scene-1">Scene 1 1 / running scene 1</h4>
<p>Enter Beggar and Hostess, [the beggar is called ] Christopher Sly</p>
<p>SLY I’ll pheeze 2 you, in faith.</p>
<p>HOSTESS A pair of stocks 3 , you rogue!</p>
<p>SLY You’re a baggage 4 , the Slys are no rogues. Look in the
chronicles 5 , we came in with Richard Conqueror 6 : therefore paucas
pallabris 7 , let the world slide. Sessa! 8</p>
<p>HOSTESS You will not pay for the glasses you have burst 9 ?</p>
<p>SLY No, not a denier 10 . Go by, Saint Jeronimy 11 , go to thy cold
bed 12 and warm thee.</p>
<p>HOSTESS I know my remedy: I must go fetch the thirdborough 13 .</p>
<p>[Exit ]</p>
<p>SLY Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I’ll answer him by law 14 .
I’ll not budge an inch, boy. Let him come, and kindly 15 .</p>
<p>[He ] falls asleep</p>
<p>Wind horns. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train</p>
<p>LORD Huntsman, I charge 16 thee tender well 17 my hounds.</p>
<p>Brach 18 Merriman, the poor cur 19 is embossed 20 ,</p>
<p>And couple 21 Clowder with the deep-mouthed brach 22 .</p>
<p>Saw’st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good 23</p>
<p>At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault 24 ?</p>
<p>I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.</p>
<p>FIRST HUNTSMAN Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord.</p>
<p>He cried upon it at the merest 25 loss 26 ,</p>
<p>And twice today picked out the dullest scent.</p>
<p>Trust me, I take him for the better dog.</p>
<p>LORD Thou art a fool. If Echo were as fleet 27 ,</p>
<p>I would esteem him worth a dozen such.</p>
<p>But sup 28 them well and look unto 29 them all:</p>
<p>Tomorrow I intend to hunt again.</p>
<p>FIRST HUNTSMAN I will, my lord.</p>
<p>LORD What’s here? One dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?</p>
<p>Sees Sly</p>
<p>SECOND HUNTSMAN He breathes, my lord. Were he not warmed with
ale,</p>
<p>This were a bed but cold 30 to sleep so soundly.</p>
<p>LORD O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!</p>
<p>Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image 31 .</p>
<p>Sirs, I will practise on 32 this drunken man.</p>
<p>What think you, if he were conveyed to bed,</p>
<p>Wrapped in sweet 33 clothes, rings put upon his fingers,</p>
<p>A most delicious banquet 34 by his bed,</p>
<p>And brave 35 attendants near him when he wakes,</p>
<p>Would not the beggar then forget himself 36 ?</p>
<p>FIRST HUNTSMAN Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose 37 .</p>
<p>SECOND HUNTSMAN It would seem strange 38 unto him when he waked.</p>
<p>LORD Even as a flatt’ring dream or worthless fancy 39 .</p>
<p>Then take him up and manage well the jest:</p>
<p>Carry him gently to my fairest chamber</p>
<p>And hang it round 40 with all my wanton 41 pictures:</p>
<p>Balm 42 his foul 43 head in warm distillèd 44 waters</p>
<p>And burn sweet 45 wood to make the lodging sweet:</p>
<p>Procure me music ready when he wakes,</p>
<p>To make a dulcet 46 and a heavenly sound.</p>
<p>And if he chance to speak, be ready straight 47</p>
<p>And with a low 48 submissive reverence 49</p>
<p>Say ‘What is it your honour will command?’</p>
<p>Let one attend him with a silver basin</p>
<p>Full of rose-water and bestrewed with flowers,</p>
<p>Another bear the ewer 50 , the third a diaper 51 ,</p>
<p>And say ‘Will’t please your lordship cool your hands?’</p>
<p>Someone be ready with a costly suit</p>
<p>And ask him what apparel he will wear.</p>
<p>Another tell him of his hounds and horse,</p>
<p>And that his lady mourns at his disease 52 .</p>
<p>Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,</p>
<p>And when he says he is 53 , say that he dreams,</p>
<p>For he is nothing but a mighty lord.</p>
<p>This do, and do it kindly 54 , gentle sirs.</p>
<p>It will be pastime passing 55 excellent,</p>
<p>If it be husbanded 56 with modesty 57 .</p>
<p>FIRST HUNTSMAN My lord, I warrant 58 you we will play our part,</p>
<p>As 59 he shall think by our true diligence</p>
<p>He is no less than what we say he is.</p>
<p>LORD Take him up gently and to bed with him,</p>
<p>Some carry out Sly</p>
<p>And each one to his office 60 when he wakes.</p>
<p>Sound trumpets</p>
<p>Sirrah 61 , go see what trumpet ’tis that sounds.</p>
<p>[Exit a Servingman ]</p>
<p>Belike 62 , some noble gentleman that means,</p>
<p>Travelling some journey, to repose him here.</p>
<p>Enter Servingman</p>
<p>How now? Who is it?</p>
<p>SERVINGMAN An’t 63 please your honour, players</p>
<p>That offer service to your lordship.</p>
<p>Enter Players</p>
<p>LORD Bid them come near.— Now, fellows, you are welcome.</p>
<p>PLAYERS We thank your honour.</p>
<p>LORD Do you intend to stay with me tonight?</p>
<p>SECOND PLAYER So please 64 your lordship to accept our duty 65 .</p>
<p>LORD With all my heart. This fellow I remember,</p>
<p>Since once he played a farmer’s eldest son.</p>
<p>’Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well:</p>
<p>I have forgot your name, but, sure, that part</p>
<p>Was aptly fitted 66 and naturally performed.</p>
<p>FIRST PLAYER I think ’twas Soto that your honour means.</p>
<p>LORD ’Tis very true, thou didst it excellent.</p>
<p>Well, you are come to me in happy 67 time,</p>
<p>The rather for 68 I have some sport in hand</p>
<p>Wherein your cunning 69 can assist me much.</p>
<p>There is a lord will hear you play tonight;</p>
<p>But I am doubtful 70 of your modesties 71 ,</p>
<p>Lest over-eyeing of 72 his odd behaviour —</p>
<p>For yet his honour never heard a play —</p>
<p>You break into some merry passion 73</p>
<p>And so offend him, for I tell you, sirs,</p>
<p>If you should smile he grows impatient 74 .</p>
<p>FIRST PLAYER Fear not, my lord, we can contain ourselves</p>
<p>Were he the veriest antic 75 in the world.</p>
<p>LORD Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery 76 ,</p>
<p>To a Servingman</p>
<p>And give them friendly welcome every one.</p>
<p>Let them want 77 nothing that my house affords 78 .</p>
<p>Exit one with the Players</p>
<p>Sirrah, go you to Barthol’mew my page,</p>
<p>And see him dressed in all suits 79 like a lady.</p>
<p>That done, conduct him to the drunkard’s chamber,</p>
<p>And call him ‘madam’, do him obeisance 80 .</p>
<p>Tell him from me, as he will 81 win my love,</p>
<p>He bear 82 himself with honourable action 83 ,</p>
<p>Such as he hath observed in noble ladies</p>
<p>Unto their lords, by them accomplishèd 84 :</p>
<p>Such duty 85 to the drunkard let him do</p>
<p>With soft low tongue 86 and lowly 87 courtesy,</p>
<p>And say, ’What is’t your honour will command,</p>
<p>Wherein your lady and your humble wife</p>
<p>May show her duty and make known her love?’</p>
<p>And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,</p>
<p>And with declining head into his bosom 88 ,</p>
<p>Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed</p>
<p>To see her noble lord restored to health,</p>
<p>Who for this seven years hath esteemèd him 89</p>
<p>No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:</p>
<p>And if the boy have not a woman’s gift</p>
<p>To rain a shower of commanded tears 90 ,</p>
<p>An onion will do well for such a shift 91 ,</p>
<p>Which in a napkin 92 being close conveyed 93</p>
<p>Shall in despite 94 enforce a watery eye.</p>
<p>See this dispatched 95 with all the haste thou canst.</p>
<p>Anon 96 I’ll give thee more instructions.</p>
<p>Exit a Servingman</p>
<p>I know the boy will well usurp the grace 97 ,</p>
<p>Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:</p>
<p>I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,</p>
<p>And how 98 my men will stay 99 themselves from laughter</p>
<p>When they do homage to this simple peasant.</p>
<p>I’ll in 100 to counsel them. Haply 101 my presence</p>
<p>May well abate the over-merry spleen 102</p>
<p>Which otherwise would grow into extremes.</p>
<p>[Exeunt ]</p>
