<h4 id="preface-to-the-2011-edition">PREFACE TO THE 2011 EDITION</h4>
<p>Maps of Time was published in 2004. To my delight it was treated very
kindly. I was surprised, because I expected historians in particular to
reject the very idea of a sort of “universal history,” a history of all
of time. Skepticism there certainly was about the idea of big history,
and plenty of quibbles about particular parts of the text, but most
reviewers seemed convinced that the project was not absurd and could
indeed yield interesting insights. Some were more enthusiastic, seeing
big history as an exciting new area of historical scholarship. World
historians were particularly generous in their support, a generosity
reflected in the awarding to Maps of Time of the WHA prize for the best
book in world history published in 2004. Maps of Time has also gone
international, with translations into Spanish and Mandarin, which means
it is now available in the world’s three most widely spoken languages. A
Korean translation is in preparation.</p>
<p>Since 2004, interest in big history has grown, and now big history
can realistically be thought of as a rapidly emerging field of teaching
and scholarship. Some idea of this boom can be gleaned from the
bibliography compiled by Barry Rodrigue, Fred Spier, and Daniel Stasko
and available from the International Big History Association web site at
www.ibhanet.org. Recent works include a major survey of big history by
Cynthia Brown, and Fred Spier’s rich theorization of big history, Big
History and the Future of Humanity.1 In 2007 I recorded a set of
lectures on big history published by the Teaching Company, and the
college-level text in big history that I have written with Cynthia Brown
and Craig Benjamin will be available in 2012.</p>
<p>I remain happy with the basic arguments of Maps of Time, though my
own ideas have continued to evolve since 2004. Definitions of what big
history is are acquiring a sharper focus. For example, it is clear that
what distinguishes big history most decisively from world history is its
interdisciplinary nature and its search for an underlying unity beneath
the various accounts of the past told in different historically oriented
disciplines. Big history studies the past across physics, astronomy,
geology, biology, and human history. As it does so, it seeks common
themes, paradigms, and methods, as well as a clearer understanding of
differences in the subject matter, the methods, and the paradigms of
different fields of historical scholarship.</p>
<p>Some ideas that were present but undeveloped in Maps of Time have
since acquired sharper definition, both in my own mind and in the work
of colleagues in the field. For example:</p>
<p>• In Big History and the Future of Humanity, Fred Spier has built on
an earlier work of his and on the work of Eric Chaisson to produce what
is currently by far the most sophisticated attempt to construct a
thematic scaffolding for big history. He carefully links the idea of
increasing complexity with the associated themes of energy flows and the
idea of goldilocks conditions—the notion that complexity can increase
only under very special conditions and within quite exacting “boundary
conditions.” Here are broad theoretical ideas that can help give greater
depth and coherence to the story told within big history.</p>
<p>• I have explored the idea that the chronometric revolution—that is
to say, the evolution of new ways of providing absolute dates for past
events—was a crucial step toward big history2 Before the middle of the
twentieth century (as H. G. Wells admitted ruefully in the 1920s), it
was impossible to write a rigorous, scientific history of the entire
universe, because absolute dates still had to be based on written texts,
so they could reach back no further than a few thousand years. That may
help explain the powerful convention that “history” really meant no more
than the history of literate human societies. Only with the appearance
of carbon 14 dating and related dating techniques in the 1950s did big
history become possible.</p>
<p>• There has also been considerable discussion of the historiography
of big history and of how the field fits into the evolution of
historical thinking as a whole. My own attempt to think this through can
be found in “The Return of Universal History”3 Craig Benjamin has
written a fine account of the evolution of big history in the
introduction to a series of articles on the subject.4</p>
<p>One of the most exciting features of big history is its inherently
global nature. Within big history, human beings are encountered first as
a single species, and only very late in such a survey do national or
civilizational perspectives acquire salience. As a result, big history
holds out the prospect of creating a genuinely global account of the
past of humanity, one not bound to national perspectives, an account
that, like good science, should work as well in Seoul or Delhi or Buenos
Aires as in London or New York.</p>
<p>New concepts are also emerging that capture well the distinctive
perspective of big history. One of the most powerful is the idea
proposed by the Nobel Prize–winning climatologist Paul Crutzen that
today we have entered a new geological era, the “Anthropocene,” the
first era in the history of the planet in which a single species, our
own, has become the dominant force in shaping the biosphere.5 That
vision of the contemporary world fits very well with big history’s
inherently ecological account of human history.</p>
<p>Since 2004 there have been major organizational developments in the
field. The number of college-level courses in big history has increased
rapidly, and there may be at least fifty such courses being taught
throughout the world today. With the encouragement and support of
Cynthia Brown, Dominican University of California in San Rafael (near
San Francisco) has become the first university to introduce big history
as a foundation course for first-year students. In April 2011, a
scholarly organization was founded to develop big history as a research
and teaching field: the International Big History Association. Barry
Rodrigue and Daniel Stasko have traced the rapid expansion of teaching
and scholarship in big history in essays available on the IBHA web site,
and in August 2012 the IBHA will host the first major international big
history conference in Michigan.6 In March 2011 the “Big History Project”
was launched to build a free online high school syllabus in big
history.7 There are many indirect signs that big history is finding its
way to a wide audience. In Amsterdam, big history has been the subject
of public debate for well over a decade, in response both to the
University of Amsterdam’s introduction of a big history course and to
the granting to William McNeill of an Erasmus Prize in 1996. Fred Spier
and Barry Rodrigue have tracked teachers and scholars interested in the
field and have shown that a remarkable number of people are undertaking
courses or research projects closely aligned with the goals of big
history.</p>
<p>But despite these signs of growth, the field still has a long way to
travel. The conventional borders between disciplines remain well policed
and are sometimes defended with surprising aggression. This may help
explain why, though there now exists a substantial body of big history
scholarship, and big history promises to open up exciting new research
agendas (including the meaning of complexity and energy flows, and the
role of information across many disciplines), there are still no large
interdisciplinary research projects in the field. At the time of
writing, there is only one formal university appointment in big history
(Fred Spier at the University of Amsterdam), and there exists only a
tiny cohort of graduate students engaged in big history projects (three
of them currently at Macquarie University in Sydney). A start has been
made on teaching big history in high schools. But it remains to be seen
how many schools and education departments will decide that teaching big
history can help students understand the underlying unity and coherence
of modern knowledge and appreciate the powerful intellectual synergies
to be found in genuinely interdisciplinary thinking and teaching.</p>
<p>I am confident that big history will flourish, partly because it
evidently has the ability, like a gestalt switch, to help students and
scholars see familiar things in new ways. The other reason for my
confidence is the energy, intelligence, generosity, and adventurousness
of the small group of scholars who have helped build the field over the
past two decades. Building big history has truly been an exercise in
collective learning.</p>
<p>I would like to end by thanking William McNeill for lending his great
authority to a field of historical scholarship that, even a decade ago,
seemed extremely marginal. His support of big history has done a huge
amount to persuade historians that the project is interesting,
illuminating, and important, and that they may have much to gain by
expanding their vision of what “history” means.</p>
