<h4 id="acknowledgments">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h4>
<p>A project like this turns a person into a magpie. You collect ideas
and information voraciously; and after a bit you can start to forget
each particular act of intellectual larceny. Fortunately for me, most
scholars are (despite popular reputation) astonishingly generous with
their time and ideas. I have benefited from this generosity particularly
at the two institutions at which I have spent most of my career:
Macquarie University in Sydney and San Diego State University in
California. I will try to acknowledge as many debts as I can, but there
are many more that I cannot acknowledge because I cannot remember them.
Suggestions, approaches, book references have been tucked away in my
mind so securely that I cannot remember where I got them; sometimes I
may even be tempted to think of them as my own discoveries. Where such
memory lapses have happened (and I am sure they often have), I can only
apologize and express a generalized thanks to those friends and
colleagues who have had the patience to discuss with me the large-scale
historical problems that have fascinated me now for more than a
decade.</p>
<p>I would particularly like to thank Chardi, who is a professional
storyteller and a Jungian. She persuaded me that I was really teaching a
creation myth. I also want to thank Terry (Edmund) Burke, who teaches a
course on “big history” at Santa Cruz, in California. He persuaded me
that the time had come to try to write a textbook on big history, in the
hope that it might encourage others to teach similar courses. He has
also given me invaluable (if sometimes painful) criticism on earlier
drafts of this manuscript. And he has been a constant source of
encouragement.</p>
<p>I am extremely grateful to all those who lectured or tutored in the
big history course I taught at Macquarie University between 1989 and
1999. I list them in alphabetical order: David Allen, Michael Archer,
Ian Bedford, Craig Benjamin, Jerry Bentley, David Briscoe, David Cahill,
Geoff Cowling, Bill Edmonds, Brian Fegan, Dick Flood, Leighton Frappell,
Annette Hamilton, Mervyn Hartwig, Ann Henderson-Sellers, Edwin Judge,
Max Kelly, Bernard Knapp, John Koenig, Jim Kohen, Sam Lieu, David Malin,
John Merson, Rod Miller, Nick Modjeska, Marc Norman, Bob Norton, Ron
Paton, David Phillips, Chris Powell, Caroline Ralston, George Raudzens,
Stephen Shortus, Alan Thorne, Terry Widders, and Michael Williams. I
would also like to thank Macquarie University for the period of academic
leave during which the first draft of this book was written.</p>
<p>Several people have been particularly supportive of the idea of big
history, and some have taught other courses on the big history scale.
John Mears started teaching such a class at about the same time as I
did, and has always been an enthusiastic supporter of the idea. Tom
Griffiths and colleagues taught a big history course at Monash
University in the early 1990s. Johan Goudsblom began teaching one at the
University of Amsterdam, and has been an enthusiastic supporter of the
project. His colleague, Fred Spier, wrote the first book on big history,
an ambitious and brilliantly argued case for the construction of a
“grand unified theory” embracing the social sciences as well as the
natural sciences (The Structure of Big History: From the Big Bang until
Today). Others who have expressed interest and support for such an
approach or have taught similar courses include George Brooks, Edmund
Burke III, Marc Cioc, Ann Curthoys, Graeme Davidson, Ross Dunn, Arturo
Giraldez, Bill Leadbetter, and Heidi Roupp. At the American Historical
Association conference in Seattle in January 1998, Arnold Schrier
chaired a panel on big history that included papers from myself, John
Mears, and Fred Spier, as well as a perceptive and supportive commentary
from Patricia O’Neal. Gale Stokes invited me to discuss big history on a
panel on “the play of scales” at the American Historical Association
conference in San Francisco in January 2002.</p>
<p>A number of other people have read or commented on drafts of parts of
this book. In addition to some of those already listed, they include
Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman, Ross Dunn, Patricia Fara, Ernie Grieshaber,
Chris Lloyd, Winton Higgins, Peter Menzies, and Louis Schwartzkopf.
Professor I. D. Koval’chenko invited me to give a talk on big history at
Moscow University, and Valerii Nikolayev invited me to talk at the
Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow, both in 1990. Stephen Mennell
asked me to speak about big history at a conference he convened almost
ten years ago, and Eric Jones gave me invaluable feedback on that paper.
Ken Pomeranz sent me a draft chapter from his then-unpublished book on
the “great divergence” and invited me to speak on big history at the
University of California, Irvine. Over the years, I have given talks on
big history at many other universities, including Macquarie and Monash
Universities and the Universities of Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle,
Wollongong, and Western Australia in Australia; at the University of
California, Santa Cruz; at Minnesota State University, Mankato; and at
Indiana University, Bloomington, in the United States; at Victoria
University in Canada; and at Newcastle and Manchester Universities in
the United Kingdom. I worked with John Anderson for almost two years on
a theoretical article on power- and wealth-maximizing societies. The
article never saw the light of day, but collaborating with John gave me
many new insights into the transition to modernity.</p>
<p>Since sending out copies of an earlier draft of this text in
September 1999, I have received generous criticisms and comments from
several other colleagues. They include (in alphabetical order): Alfred
Crosby, Arturo Giráldez, Johan Goudsblom, Marnie Hughes-Warrington,
William H. McNeill, John Mears, Fred Spier, and Mark Welter. I am also
grateful to at least two anonymous reviewers recruited by the University
of California Press. Marnie Hughes-Warrington taught with me in my big
history course in 2000 and offered many invaluable suggestions. As a
historiographer, she was able to alert me to historiographical
implications of the subject that I had missed. William McNeill engaged
in a long and generous correspondence with me about an earlier draft of
this manuscript. His comments were both encouraging and critical, and
they have shaped my own ideas substantially. In particular, he persuaded
me to take more seriously the role of networks of exchange in world
history.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank the many students whom I have taught at
Macquarie in HIST112: An Introduction to World History, and at San Diego
State University in HIST411: World History for Teachers and HIST100:
World History. Their questions kept me focused on what is important. I
am particularly thankful to those students who provided me with
information or told me about new discoveries they found in books I
didn’t know about or on the Internet, and also to those who, by enjoying
the course, made me feel it was worthwhile.</p>
<p>I feel I owe particular thanks to the staff of the University of
California Press, including Lynne Withey, Suzanne Knott, and many
others. Alice Falk copyedited my manuscript with terrifying
thoroughness. Their professionalism, courtesy, and good humor greatly
eased the complex and sometimes difficult passage from manuscript to
book.</p>
<p>In a book on this scale, it goes without saying that no one I have
thanked for their help or support is in any way to blame for errors in
the text; nor can it be assumed that any of them necessarily agree with
the book’s argument. I remained stubborn enough to resist many of the
kindly criticisms that have been offered of its earlier drafts, so I
must remain wholly responsible for all remaining errors of fact,
interpretation, or balance.</p>
<p>I hope Chardi, Joshua, and Emily will think of this as a gift from
me, a small return for the gift that they have been to me over many
years.</p>
