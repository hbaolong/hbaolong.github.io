<h4 id="from-power-over-nature-to-power-over-people">9 FROM POWER OVER
NATURE TO POWER OVER PEOPLE</h4>
<p>CITIES, STATES, AND “CIVILIZATIONS”</p>
<p>SOCIAL COMPLEXITY</p>
<p>In the early universe, gravity took hold of clouds of atoms, and
sculpted them into stars and galaxies. In the era described in this
chapter, we will see how, by a sort of social gravity, cities and states
were sculpted from scattered communities of farmers. As farming
populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions
between different groups increased and the social pressure rose until,
in a striking parallel with star formation, new structures suddenly
appeared, together with a new level of complexity. Like stars, cities
and states reorganize and energize the smaller objects within their
gravitational field.</p>
<p>The urbanized, state-organized, and often warring communities that
were the products of these changes have been the main focus of modern
historiography. So it has been all too easy for historians to forget how
different these communities were from the small-scale and relatively
nonhierarchical societies of the Paleolithic and the early agrarian
eras. In fact, most of human history (chronologically speaking) has
taken place in communities quite innocent of state power. Even in the
villages of the early agrarian era, for most people, most of the time,
the important relationships were personal, local, and fairly
egalitarian. Most households were self-sufficient, and people dealt with
each other as people rather than as the representatives of
institutions.</p>
<p>Then, about 5,000 years ago, the first states appeared. Small
city-states existed in southern Mesopotamia by ca. 3200 BCE (see map
9.1). By 3100 BCE a state had appeared in Egypt, where a regional
official (named Menes or Narmer) united north and south into a single
kingdom and founded the first Egyptian dynasty. States also appeared in
other regions of rising population density—in northern India and China
by ca. 2000 BCE, and in Mesoamerica by 1000 BCE (see map 9.2). The
appearance of the first states marks a critical transition from personal
relations to impersonal power, and from power over things to power over
people.1 The world of hierarchy, power, and states is the one we know
today. It is a world in which the wealth and power of individuals and
communities can vary tremendously, according to their birth, their
gender, and the ethnic group to which they belong. Marvin Harris
describes the change as the end of equality.</p>
<p>Map 9.1. Ancient Sumer.</p>
<p>Map 9.2. Ancient Mesoamerica.</p>
<p>For the first time there appeared on earth kings, dictators, high
priests, emperors, prime ministers, presidents, governors, mayors,
generals, admirals, police chiefs, judges, lawyers, and jailers, along
with dungeons, jails, penitentiaries, and concentration camps. Under the
tutelage of the state, human beings learned for the first time how to
bow, grovel, kneel, and kowtow. In many ways the rise of the state was
the descent of the world from freedom to slavery.2</p>
<p>States were normally embedded within larger regions that included
other states and their hinterlands. I will describe such regions as
agrarian civilizations. Civilization is often taken as a synonym for
progress, but that is not the sense in which the word is used here.
Though there are clear differences between agrarian civilizations and
other types of human community, I make no judgments about the intrinsic
worth of any particular type of society. I define agrarian civilizations
as large societies based on agriculture, with states and all that that
implies (literacy, warfare, etc.). The term agrarian civilization may
seem self-contradictory, for we associate civilization (a term derived
from civis, the Latin word meaning “citizen”) with states and
particularly their cities. But the adjective agrarian reminds us that
all premodern cities depended on rural hinterlands at the city’s edge or
in more distant villages.</p>
<p>It will help to think of the emergence of cities and states, like the
evolution of multicellular organisms, as a process that linked once
independent entities into larger unities. Figure 9.1 offers a simplified
way of thinking about some of the main stages in this process (and see
table 9.1).3 The transition discussed in this chapter can be thought of
as a shift from level 4 to level 5, while agrarian civilizations in
general are normally organized at levels 5 and 6.</p>
<p>How can we explain this fundamental transition? Increasing population
density in farming regions provided the demographic and physical raw
materials used to construct the first cities and states, and increasing
congestion provided much of the motivation for creating states.4 But did
local communities willingly join together, or were they pushed together?
The answer is probably a bit of both.</p>
