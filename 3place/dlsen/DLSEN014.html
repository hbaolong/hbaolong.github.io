<h4 id="the-origins-of-life-and-the-theory-of-evolution">4 THE ORIGINS
OF LIFE AND THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION</h4>
<p>LIFE: A NEW LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY</p>
<p>“What is life?” The physicist Erwin Schrödinger asked this question
in a famous series of lectures given in Dublin in 1943. Schrödinger’s
answer was remarkably prescient, for he wrote before we had any real
understanding of the genetic basis of life. He argued that we should be
able to explain life as scientifically as we can explain physics or
chemistry. But he also understood that we cannot define life simply by
referring to a checklist. Like all complex entities, living organisms
manage significant flows of energy and matter, so they must have some
form of metabolism. They take in and excrete energy and nutrients. They
also reproduce, again like many other complex but nonliving entities
from tornadoes to crystals. So neither metabolism nor reproduction alone
can provide a satisfactory definition of life; it is the way they work
together to create a new level of complexity that is critical.
Schrödinger therefore suggested another way of defining what is
distinctive about life. Life is not just complex—it is significantly
more complex than anything else in the universe; and the level of
orderliness achieved by living organisms is remarkable, given the
general tendency of the universe toward disorder. “The unfolding of
events in the life cycle of an organism exhibits an admirable regularity
and orderliness, unrivalled by anything we meet with in inanimate
matter.”1</p>
<p>Stars can climb the thermodynamic down escalator (see appendix 2),
but living organisms climb it with greater agility. Indeed, Eric
Chaisson has argued that the level of complexity achieved by living
organisms can be measured, roughly but quite objectively, by estimating
the density of the energy flows that sustain them against the
destructive pressure of the second law of thermodynamics.2 Table 4.1
gives Chaisson’s approximations of these energy flows. The right-hand
column, which measures the amount of free energy passing through a given
mass in a given amount of time, appears to indicate that living
organisms can handle far denser flows of energy than stars without
breaking down. And this ability is what lets them climb farther and
faster up the thermodynamic down escalator. In Schrödinger’s famous
phrase, each living organism seems to have an astonishing capacity for
“continually sucking orderliness from its environment.”3 The simplest
structures have also been around longest, and the more complex
structures have appeared more recently, which suggests that creating
them was a more difficult evolutionary task. Finally, it is also clear
that the more complex entities in the bottom half of the table are more
fragile. While stars and planets may live for many billions of years,
even the longest-living organisms (at least those we know of) can live
for only a few thousand years, and most live for only a few days or
years. That the most complex structures break down so fast is a measure
of the difficulty of managing particularly dense energy flows: this is
the price living organisms pay for their aggressive challenge to the
second law of thermodynamics. Thus in dealing with life we are dealing
with a new level of order and complexity, a new capacity to control and
organize free energy that is achieved at the price of greater fragility.
As Martin Rees has written, “A star is simpler than an insect.”4 But a
star also lives much longer.</p>
<p>Chemical processes may have generated life elsewhere in the universe,
though at present we do not know if this is true. But we do know that
life appeared on Earth within 600 million years of the planet’s
creation. By geological standards, and given the harsh conditions of the
early earth, that was quick. And from the moment life appeared, living
organisms have multiplied and changed in a dazzling and apparently
endless cascade of new life forms, each finely tuned to handle the
particular energies and resources in its immediate environment. Unlike
stars or crystals, which are general, all-purpose antientropy machines,
living organisms can adapt constantly to new terrain and new challenges
in their more flexible guerrilla war on entropy. Collectively, living
organisms explore their environment in ways that have no parallel in the
inanimate world. And what they find is new sources of energy and new
ways of organizing themselves so as to survive the hurricane of energy
flowing through them. Not all of these changes lead to greater
complexity, but some do. This is why life has such an astonishing
capacity to conjure up new types of complexity.</p>
<p>What is the source of the energy differential that sustains these
complex entities? The answer to that question is blessedly clear: the
ultimate source is gravity. We have seen that gravity can create
stars—objects of great density and high temperatures. But the universe
as a whole is extremely cold; its average temperature is about 3°C above
absolute zero, the temperature of the cosmic background radiation. So
stars are embedded within the cold universe like billions of tiny points
of light and heat. It is no accident that we live huddled near a star,
for here we can tap the huge energy flows pouring into space from the
nuclear furnace at the Sun’s core.</p>
