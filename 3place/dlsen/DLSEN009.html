<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>A MODERN CREATION MYTH?</p>
<p>“BIG HISTORY”: LOOKING AT THE PAST ON ALL TIMESCALES</p>
<p>[T]he way to study history is to view it as a long duration, as what
I have called the longue durée. It is not the only way, but it is one
which by itself can pose all the great problems of social structures,
past and present. It is the only language binding history to the
present, creating one indivisible whole.</p>
<p>Universal history comprehends the past life of mankind, not in its
particular relations and trends, but in its fullness and totality.</p>
<p>A Moment’s Halt—a momentary taste</p>
<p>Of BEING from the Well amid the Waste—</p>
<p>And Lo!—the phantom Caravan has reached</p>
<p>The NOTHING it set out from—Oh, make haste!</p>
<p>Like merchants in a huge desert caravan, we need to know where we are
going, where we have come from, and in whose company we are traveling.
Modern science tells us that the caravan is vast and varied, and our
fellow travelers include numerous exotic creatures, from quarks to
galaxies. We also know a lot about where the journey started and where
it is headed. In these ways, modern science can help us answer some of
the deepest questions we can ask concerning our own existence, and that
of the universe through which we travel. It can help us draw the line we
all must draw between the personal and the universal.</p>
<p>“Who am I? Where do I belong? What is the totality of which I am a
part?” In some form, all human communities have asked these questions.
And in most human societies, educational systems, formal and informal,
have tried to answer them. Often, the answers have been embedded in
cycles of creation myths. By offering memorable and authoritative
accounts of how everything began—from our own communities, to the
animals, plants, and landscapes around us, to the earth, the Moon and
skies, and even the universe itself—creation myths provide universal
coordinates within which people can imagine their own existence and find
a role in the larger scheme of things. Creation myths are powerful
because they speak to our deep spiritual, psychic, and social need for a
sense of place and a sense of belonging. Because they provide so
fundamental a sense of orientation, they are often integrated into
religious thinking at the deepest levels, as the Genesis story is within
the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition. It is one of the many odd
features of modern society that despite having access to more hard
information than any earlier society, those in modern educational
systems do not normally teach such a story. Instead, from schools to
universities to research institutes, we teach about origins in
disconnected fragments. We seem incapable of offering a unified account
of how things came to be the way they are.</p>
<p>I have written this book in the belief that such intellectual modesty
is unnecessary and harmful. It is unnecessary because the elements of a
modern creation myth are all around us. It is harmful because it
contributes to the subtle but pervasive quality of disorientation in
modern life that the pioneering French sociologist Émile Durkheim
referred to as “anomie”: the sense of not fitting in, which is an
inescapable condition of those who have no conception of what it is they
are supposed to fit into.</p>
<p>Maps of Time attempts to assemble a coherent and accessible account
of origins, a modern creation myth. It began as a series of lectures in
an experimental history course taught at Macquarie University in Sydney.
The idea of that course was to see if it was possible, even in the
modern world, to tell a coherent story about the past on many different
scales, beginning, literally, with the origins of the universe and
ending in the present day. Each scale, I hoped, would add something new
to the total picture and make it easier to understand all the other
scales. Given the conventions of the modern history profession, this was
an extremely presumptuous idea. But it turned out to be surprisingly
doable, and even more interesting than I had originally supposed. Part
of the task of my introduction will be to justify this distinctive way
of thinking and teaching about the past.</p>
<p>I began teaching “big history” in 1989; two years later I published
an essay in which I attempted a formal defense of this approach.1 Though
aware of the oddity of the project, those of us trying to teach big
history were soon convinced that these large questions made for
interesting classes and encouraged fruitful thinking about the nature of
history. Teaching this large story persuaded us that beneath the awesome
diversity and complexity of modern knowledge, there is an underlying
unity and coherence, ensuring that different timescales really do have
something to say to each other. Taken together, these stories have all
the power and richness of a traditional cycle of creation myths. They
constitute what indigenous Australians might call a modern “Dreaming”—a
coherent account of how we were created and how we fit into the scheme
of things.</p>
<p>We found something else that most premodern societies have known:
there is an astonishing power to any story that attempts to grasp
reality whole. This power is quite independent of the success or failure
of any particular attempt; the project itself is powerful, and fulfills
deep needs. Trying to look at the whole of the past is, it seems to me,
like using a map of the world. No geographer would try to teach
exclusively from street maps. Yet most historians teach about the past
of particular nations, or even of agrarian civilizations, without ever
asking what the whole of the past looks like. So what is the temporal
equivalent of the world map? Is there a map of time that embraces the
past at all scales?</p>
<p>This is a good moment to raise such questions, because there is a
growing sense, across many scholarly disciplines, that we need to move
beyond the fragmented account of reality that has dominated scholarship
(and served it well) for a century. Scientists have moved fastest in
this direction. The success of Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time
(1988) also shows the great popular interest in trying to understand
reality whole. In Hawking’s own field, cosmology, the idea of a “grand
unified theory” once seemed ridiculously overambitious. Now it is taken
for granted. Biology and geology have also moved toward more unified
accounts of their subject matter, with the consolidation, since the
1960s, of modern paradigms of evolution and plate tectonics.2</p>
<p>Scholars at the Santa Fe Institute in the United States have been
exploring such interconnections for many years. An associate of the
institute, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Murray Gell-Mann, has
eloquently stated the arguments for a more unified account of reality as
they appear to a physicist.</p>
<p>We live in an age of increasing specialization, and for good reason.
Humanity keeps learning more about each field of study; and as every
specialty grows, it tends to split into subspecialties. That process
happens over and over again, and it is necessary and desirable. However,
there is also a growing need for specialization to be supplemented by
integration. The reason is that no complex, nonlinear system can be
adequately described by dividing it up into subsystems or into various
aspects, defined beforehand. If those subsystems or those aspects, all
in strong interaction with one another, are studied separately, even
with great care, the results, when put together, do not give a useful
picture of the whole. In that sense, there is profound truth in the old
adage, ’The whole is more than the sum of its parts.”</p>
<p>People must therefore get away from the idea that serious work is
restricted to beating to death a well-defined problem in a narrow
discipline, while broadly integrative thinking is relegated to cocktail
parties. In academic life, in bureaucracies, and elsewhere, the task of
integration is insufficiently respected.</p>
<p>At the Santa Fe Institute, he adds, “People are found who have the
courage to take a crude look at the whole in addition to studying the
behavior of parts of a system in the traditional way.”3</p>
<p>Should historians look for a similar unifying structure, perhaps a
“grand unified story” that can summarize the best modern knowledge about
origins from a historian’s perspective? The rise of the new
subdiscipline of world history is a sign that many historians also feel
the need for a more coherent vision of their subject. Big history is a
response to this need. In the late 1980s, John Mears, at Southern
Methodist University (in Dallas, Texas), began teaching a history course
on the largest possible scales at about the same time as I did. And
since then, a number of other universities have offered similar
courses—in Melbourne, Canberra, and Perth in Australia; in Amsterdam;
and also in Santa Cruz in the United States. Fred Spier, from the
University of Amsterdam, has gone one step further and written the first
book on big history. In it, he offers an ambitious defense of the
project of constructing a unified account of the past at all
scales.4</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is a growing sense among scholars in many fields
that we may be close to a grand unification of knowledge. The biologist
E. O. Wilson has argued that we need to start exploring the links
between different domains of knowledge, from cosmology to ethics.5 The
world historian William McNeill has written:</p>
<p>Human beings, it appears, do indeed belong in the universe and share
its unstable, evolving character. . . . [W]hat happens among human
beings and what happens among the stars looks to be part of a grand,
evolving story featuring spontaneous emergence of complexity that
generates new sorts of behavior at every level of organization from the
minutest quarks and leptons to the galaxies, from long carbon chains to
living organisms and the biosphere, and from the biosphere to the
symbolic universes of meaning within which human beings live and labor,
singly and in concert, trying always to get more of what we want and
need from the world around us.6</p>
<p>I intend this book to contribute to the larger project of
constructing a more unified vision of history and of knowledge in
general. I am well aware of the difficulties of that project. But I am
sure that it is both doable and important, so it is worth attempting in
the hope that others may eventually do it better. I am also convinced
that a modern creation myth will turn out to be as rich and as beautiful
as the creation myths of all earlier communities; it is a story that
deserves telling even if the telling is imperfect.</p>
<p>STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION</p>
<p>utterly impossible as are all these events they are probably as like
those which may have taken place as any others which never took person
at all are ever likely to be</p>
<p>If the Eiffel Tower were now representing the world’s age, the skin
of paint on the pinnacle-knob at its summit would represent man’s share
of that age; and anybody would perceive that that skin was what the
tower was built for. I reckon they would, I dunno.</p>
<p>Erwin Schrödinger, one of the pioneers of quantum physics, described
the difficulties of constructing a more unified vision of knowledge in
the preface to a book he wrote on a biological topic—the origins of
life. His preface also offers the best justification I know for
presuming to undertake such a project.</p>
<p>We have inherited from our forefathers the keen longing for unified,
all-embracing knowledge. The very name given to the highest institutions
of learning reminds us, that from antiquity and throughout many
centuries the universal aspect has been the only one to be given full
credit. But the spread, both in width and depth, of the multifarious
branches of knowledge during the last hundred odd years has confronted
us with a queer dilemma. We feel clearly that we are only now beginning
to acquire reliable material for welding together the sum total of all
that is known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it has become next
to impossible for a single mind fully to command more than a small
specialized portion of it.</p>
<p>I can see no other escape from this dilemma (lest our true aim be
lost forever) than that some of us should venture to embark on a
synthesis of facts and theories, albeit with second-hand and incomplete
knowledge of some of them—and at the risking of making fools of
ourselves.</p>
<p>So much for my apology.7</p>
<p>Some of the most daunting problems posed by big history are
organizational. What shape will a modern creation myth take? From what
standpoint should it be written? What objects will take center stage?
What time-scales will dominate?</p>
<p>A modern creation myth will not and cannot hope to be “neutral.”
Modern knowledge offers no omniscient “knower,” no neutral observation
point from which all objects, from quarks to humans to galaxies, have
equal significance. We cannot be everywhere at once. So the very idea of
knowledge from no particular point of view is senseless. (Technically,
this statement reflects a philosophical position, associated with
Nietzsche, known as perspectivism.) In any case, what use could such
knowledge have? All knowledge arises from a relationship between a
knower and an object of knowledge. And knowers expect to put knowledge
to some use.</p>
<p>Creation stories, too, arise from a relationship between particular
human communities and the universe as these communities imagine it. They
offer answers to universal questions at many different scales, which is
why they sometimes appear to have a nested structure similar to a
Russian matryoshka doll—or to the Ptolemaic vision of the universe, with
its many concentric shells. At the center are those trying to
understand. At the outer edge is a totality of some kind: a universe or
a deity. In between are entities that exist at different chronological,
spatial, and mythic scales. It is thus the questions we ask that dictate
the general shape of all creation myths. And because we are humans,
humans are guaranteed to occupy more space in a creation myth than they
do in the universe as a whole. A creation myth always belongs to
someone; and the story recounted in this book is the creation myth of
modern human beings, educated in the scientific traditions of the modern
world. (Curiously, this means that the narrative structure of the modern
creation myth, like all creation myths, may appear pre-Copernican,
despite its definitely posf-Copernican content.)</p>
<p>Though its scope is vast, Maps of Time aims at not overwhelming the
reader with detail. I have tried (without complete success) to stop the
book from growing too large, in the hope that the details will not
obscure the larger picture. Those with a particular interest in any one
part of this story will have no difficulty finding out more, and the
brief guides to further reading at the end of each chapter provide some
starting points.</p>
<p>The exact balance of topics and themes in this book reflects the fact
that this is an attempt at big history from a historian’s perspective,
not that of an astronomer, a geologist, or a biologist. (Some
alternative approaches to big history are listed at the end of this
introduction.) This means that human societies loom larger than they do
in, for example, Stephen Hawking’s books, or in Preston Cloud’s Cosmos,
Earth, and Man (1978). Nevertheless, the first five chapters cover
topics that normally fall within the sciences of cosmology, geology, and
biology. They discuss the origins and evolution of the universe, of
galaxies and stars, of the solar system and the earth, and of life on
earth. The rest of the book surveys the history of our own species and
its relationship to the earth and to other species. Chapters 6 and 7
discuss the origins of human beings and the nature of the earliest human
societies. They attempt to identify what is distinctive about human
history, and what distinguishes humans from other organisms inhabiting
this earth. Chapter 8 examines the earliest agrarian societies, which
existed without cities or states. With the emergence of agriculture,
about 10,000 years ago, humans began for the first time to live in dense
communities, in which exchanges of information and goods became more
intensive than ever before. Chapters 9 and 10 describe the emergence and
evolution of cities, of states, and of agrarian civilizations. Chapters
11 to 14 try to construct a coherent interpretation of the modern world
and its origins. Finally, chapter 15 looks to the future. Big history is
inevitably concerned with large trends, and these do not stop suddenly
in the present moment. So a large view of the past inevitably raises
questions about the future, and at least some answers are available,
both for the near future (say, the next 100 years), and the remote
future (the next few billion years). Raising such questions should be a
vital part of modern education, for our assessments of the future will
affect decisions taken today; these, in turn, may shape the world
inhabited by our own children and grandchildren. They will not thank us
if we take such tasks lightly.</p>
<p>A second organizational difficulty is thematic. It may seem there can
be little coherence in a narrative that spans so many different
scholarly disciplines. But there are phenomena that cross all scales.
Above all, it turns out that the main actors are similar. At every
level, we will be interested in ordered entities, from molecules to
microbes to human societies to large chains of galaxies. Explaining how
such things can exist, how they are born, how they evolve, and how,
eventually, they perish is the stuff of history at all scales. Of
course, each scale also has its own rules—chemical in the case of
molecules, biological in the case of microbes—but the surprise is that
some underlying principles of change may be universal. This is why Fred
Spier has argued that at a fundamental level, big history is about
“regimes.” It is about the fragile ordered patterns that appear at all
scales, and the ways in which they change.8 So a central theme of big
history is how the rules of change vary at different scales, despite
some fundamental similarities in the nature of all change. Human history
is different from cosmological history; but it is not totally different.
I discuss some of the general principles of change in appendix 2, but
the book as a whole will explore some of the different rules of change
that appear at different scales.</p>
