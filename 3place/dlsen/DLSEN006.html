<h4 id="foreword">FOREWORD</h4>
<p>Maps of Time unites natural history and human history in a single,
grand, and intelligible narrative. This is a great achievement,
analogous to the way in which Isaac Newton in the seventeenth century
united the heavens and the earth under uniform laws of motion; it is
even more closely comparable to Darwin’s nineteenth-century achievement
of uniting the human species and other forms of life within a single
evolutionary process.</p>
<p>The natural history that David Christian deals with in the first
chapters of this book is itself radically extended and transformed from
the natural history of earlier ages. It starts with the big bang some 13
billion years ago, when, according to twentieth-century cosmologists,
the universe we inhabit began to expand and transform itself. Processes
thereby inaugurated are still in course, as time and space (perhaps)
began, allowing matter and energy to separate from one another and
distribute themselves throughout space in different densities and with
different rates of energy flows in response to a variety of strong and
weak forces. Matter, gathering into local clots under the influence of
gravity, became radiant stars, clustered into galaxies. New
complexities, new flows of energy arose around such structures. Then,
some 4.6 billion years ago, around one star, our sun, planet Earth
formed and soon became the seat of still more complicated processes,
including life in all its forms. Humankind added yet another level of
behavior a mere 250,000 years ago, when our use of language and other
symbols began to introduce a new capacity for what Christian calls
“collective learning.” This in turn made human societies uniquely
capable of concerting common effort so as to alter and sporadically
expand widely varying niches in the ecosystem around each of them and,
by now, surround us all in the single, global system.</p>
<p>The human history that Christian thus fits into the recently
elaborated natural history of the universe is also an intellectual
creation of the twentieth century. For while the efforts of physicists,
cosmologists, geologists, and biologists were making the natural
sciences historical, anthropologists, archaeologists, historians, and
sociologists were busy enlarging knowledge about the human career on
earth. They extended it back in time and expanded it pretty well across
the face of the earth to embrace foragers, early farmers, and other
peoples who left no written records and had therefore been excluded from
document-based “scientific” history in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Most historians, of course, paid no attention to “prehistory,” or to
the lives of illiterate peoples, busy as they were with their own
professional debates. Across the twentieth century, those debates, and
the study of abundant Eurasian and a few African and Amerindian texts,
added substantially to the sum of historical information and to the
scope of our ideas about the accomplishments of the urbanized, literate,
and civilized peoples of the earth. A few world historians, like myself,
tried to weave those researches together into a more adequate portrait
of humanity’s career as a whole; and some also explored the ecological
impact of human activity I even wrote a programmatic essay, “History and
the Scientific Worldview” (History and Theory 37, no. 1 [1998]: 1–13),
describing what had happened to the natural sciences and challenging
historians to generalize boldly enough to connect their discipline with
the historicization of the natural sciences that had taken place behind
our backs. Several scholars are, in fact, working toward that end, but
only when I began to correspond with David Christian did I discover a
historian who was already writing such a work.</p>
<p>The truly astounding dimension of Christian’s accomplishment is that
he finds similar patterns of transformation at every level. Here, for
example, is what he says about stars and cities:</p>
<p>In the early universe, gravity took hold of atoms and sculpted them
into stars and galaxies. In the era described in this chapter, we will
see how, by a sort of social gravity, cities and states were sculpted
from scattered communities of farmers. As farming populations gathered
in larger and denser communities, interactions between different groups
increased and the social pressure rose until, in a striking parallel
with star formation, new structures suddenly appeared, together with a
new level of complexity. Like stars, cities and states reorganize and
energize the smaller objects within their gravitational field.
(p. 245)</p>
<p>Or weigh the words with which he closes this extraordinary book:</p>
<p>Being complex creatures ourselves, we know from personal experience
how hard it is to climb the down escalator, to work against the
universal slide into disorder, so we are inevitably fascinated by other
entities that appear to do the same thing. Thus this theme—the
achievement of order despite, or perhaps with the aid of, the second law
of thermodynamics—is woven through all parts of the story told here. The
endless waltz of chaos and complexity provides one of this book’s
unifying ideas, (p. 511)</p>
<p>I venture to say that Christian’s discovery of order amid “the
endless waltz of chaos and complexity” is not just one among other
unifying themes, but the supreme achievement of this work.</p>
<p>Here, then, is a historical and intellectual masterpiece: clear,
coherent, erudite, elegant, venturesome, and concise. It offers his
readers a magnificent synthesis of what scholars and scientists have
learned about the world around us in the past hundred years, showing how
strangely, yet profoundly, human societies remain a part of nature,
properly at home in the universe despite our extraordinary powers,
unique self-consciousness, and inexhaustible capacity for collective
learning.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should conclude this introduction with a few words about
who David Christian is. First of all, he has an international identity,
being the son of an English father and an American mother who met and
married in Izmir, Turkey. His mother, however, returned to Brooklyn, New
York, for the birth of her son in 1946, while her husband, after
discharge from his wartime duties in the British army, joined the
colonial service and became a district officer in Nigeria. His wife
quickly joined him there, so David’s childhood was spend up-country in
Nigeria until, at age 7, he went away to boarding school in England.
Then, in due course, he went up to Oxford, getting a B.A. in modern
history in 1968. (At Oxford this means mastering isolated segments from
the history of England since Roman times along with a scattering of
other fields in European history and even a few decades sliced from the
American past: the very antithesis of “big history.”) For the next two
years, he took a job as a tutor at the University of Western Ontario in
Canada, and earned an M.A. degree there. By then he had decided to
specialize in Russian history and returned to Oxford, where a thesis on
administrative reforms under Tsar Alexander I won him a D. Phil. in
1974. Like his father, he married an American wife; they have two
children.</p>
<p>Between 1975 and 2000 he taught Russian history at Macquarie
University in Sydney, Australia, along with other courses in Russian
literature and European history. Influenced by the Annales school in
France, his interests shifted to everyday aspects of Russian lives. Two
books resulted, both dealing with what Russians put into their mouths:
Bread and Salt: A Social and Economic History of Food and Drink in
Russia (1985, coauthored with R. E. E Smith) and Living Water: Vodka and
Russian Society on the Eve of Emancipation (1990). These books soon
attracted invitations to write more general works: first Power and
Privilege: Russia and the Soviet Union in the Nineteenth and Twentieth
Centuries (1986), then A History of Russia, Central Asia, and Mongolia,
volume 1, Inner Eurasia from Prehistory to the Mongol Empire (1998).</p>
<p>The broad geographical and temporal sweep of the last of these books
already reflected a teaching venture he launched in 1989 when, in the
course of a discussion about what sort of introduction to history the
department at Macquarie ought to provide for its students, David
Christian blurted out something like “Why not start at the beginning?”
and promptly found himself invited to show his colleagues what that
might mean. Unlike every other historian who ever tried to teach human
history on a world scale, Christian decided to begin with the universe
itself; and with help from colleagues in other departments of the
university, who lectured on their own scientific specialties, he
staggered through the first year of what he jestingly chose to call “big
history.”</p>
<p>From the start, big history attracted a large and what soon became an
enthusiastic student following. But his most responsive professional
audience first arose in the Netherlands and in the United States, where
news of what David Christian was doing persuaded a handful of
venturesome teachers to launch parallel courses. The World History
Association as well as the American Historical Association took note by
devoting a session to big history at their annual meetings in 1998.
Three years later David Christian decided to accept an invitation to
come to San Diego State University and bring big history with him.</p>
<p>Other professional interests remain active. A second volume of his
History of Russia, Central Asia, and Mongolia is in the works; so is an
account of the Russian campaign to ban alcohol that peaked in the early
1920s. In his spare time David Christian has also written several
important articles on scale in the study of history and a variety of
other subjects. He is, in short, a historian of altogether unusual
energy, daring, and accomplishment.</p>
<p>You, who are about to peruse this book, have a great experience
before you. Read on, wonder, and admire.</p>
