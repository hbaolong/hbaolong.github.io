<h4 id="appendix-2-chaos-and-order">APPENDIX 2 CHAOS AND ORDER</h4>
<p>In this appendix, I will argue that there are objects that recur at
all the different scales discussed in this book. Though not essential to
understanding the book’s argument, the appendix may clarify some details
and may help the reader see more clearly some of the links between
different parts of the modern creation story.</p>
<p>Of all the patterns that occur at many different scales, the most
fundamental is the existence of pattern itself.1 Wherever we look, we
see organized structures, or regimes. We don’t see unrelated bits and
pieces, like a sort of cosmic static; patterns that are too simple and
repetitive also tend to fade into the background. What we notice are
complex patterns that combine structure and diversity. These are the
patterns that stand out against a background of disorder or extreme
simplicity, and that have histories. If there are general rules of
historical change, they concern the ways in which these patterns are
created and evolve.</p>
<p>We see complex structures in part because we are built to see complex
structures. All living organisms have to map their environment in order
to survive. They have to be able to detect seasonal changes, the
movements of the Sun and Moon, the movements of prey and predators. Thus
they have to be pattern detectors, tracking how the bits and pieces of
their environment fall into larger and more predictable shapes. Humans,
too, are constantly distinguishing between those parts of the
environment that have structure and those that do not. We are
necessarily more interested in the stars than in the vast reaches of
near-empty space that lie between them. We have also learned how to
track many patterns that are not immediately accessible to our senses,
such as the patterns of deep time. Order and chaos shape all our
attempts to understand our world.</p>
<p>But the patterns we detect are really there, and their existence is
one of the great puzzles of the universe. Why is there order of any
kind? And what rules allow the creation and evolution of ordered
structures? Creating disorder seems to be much easier than creating
order. Think of a pack of cards. Shuffled randomly, it will rarely
produce an ordered sequence—say, an ordered run of thirteen hearts. And
if it does, that sequence will vanish after a few more shuffles. But
when we study the universe as a whole, we find complex and durable
patterns at many different scales, from clusters of galaxies stretching
over millions of light-years, to the complex social structures of human
history, to the even more durable patterns that lock quarks into the
subatomic particles we call protons and neutrons.</p>
<p>Many religions solve the problem of explaining these complex and
durable patterns by claiming that complex entities such as ourselves
were created by an intelligent creator or deity. For modern science this
can be no solution, for it merely raises the further problem of how such
a deity might have been created. Can we explain complexity without
introducing a hypothesis that begs so many more questions? At present,
no entirely satisfactory answers to these questions exist; the following
paragraphs can merely hint at some modern approaches to a solution.</p>
<p>One thing is immediately clear: creating and maintaining patterns
requires work. A pack of cards has many more disordered than ordered
states, so most shuffles will yield a disordered state. The universe
seems to work similarly, with a natural tendency toward disorder and
chaos. Creating and sustaining patterns means working against this
apparently universal tendency toward disorder; it means helping unlikely
things to happen and keep happening.</p>
<p>Understanding patterns therefore means understanding how energy does
work. In the nineteenth century, studies of the efficiency with which
energy was used in steam engines led the French engineer Sadi Carnot to
the conclusion that energy never vanishes; it simply changes the forms
in which it exists. Thus as heat is used to generate steam, whose
pressure can generate the mechanical energy of a steam engine, energy
itself seems to be conserved. The law of the conservation of energy is
often called the first law of thermodynamics. The second law of
thermodynamics seems, at first sight, to contradict the first: it says
that in a closed system (which the universe seems to be), the amount of
free energy, or energy capable of doing work, tends to dissipate over
time. A waterfall can drive a turbine because the water at its top has
been lifted to higher levels, and the energy used to lift it (supplied
by the Sun, which evaporated water vapor and lifted it into the clouds)
is returned as water falls toward the sea. By the time the water has
reached the sea, it can no longer do work, because all the water at sea
level has about the same amount of available energy; it is in a state of
thermodynamic equilibrium. Usable or free energy, energy that can do
work, requires a gradient, a slope, some form of difference. The second
law predicts that over colossal periods of time, and in a closed system,
all differentials will diminish; as they do so, there will be
ever-diminishing amounts of free energy available to do the hard work of
creating and sustaining complex entities. This seems to mean that the
whole universe will eventually become less and less ordered as it tends
toward a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. In the nineteenth century,
this depressing idea was described as the “heat death” of the universe.
A German scientist, Rudolf Clausius, labeled the steadily increasing
pile of unusable energy entropy. In the very long run, it seems, entropy
must increase, and complexity must diminish.2 In the end, everything
must become background noise. The second law apparently implies that
everything in the universe is riding down the same escalator toward
chaos.</p>
<p>These ideas are fundamental to modern physics, but they raise two
deep problems. First, how is order possible at all? Why do we not find
ourselves in a universe of total disorder, in which the second law has
fulfilled its deadly mission? Did the universe start out with a stock of
free energy on which all ordered entities have drawn ever since? If so,
where did that energy capital come from and how long will it be before
it runs out? Something (or someone?) must have done some heavy lifting
in the early days of the universe to create the gradients and
differences that create and sustain the patterns we see around us.3 If
it was not a creator god who did this work, then how was it done? The
ultimate source of free energy (and therefore of order) remains one of
the great puzzles of modern cosmology, because, as far as we can tell,
the early universe was remarkably homogenous.</p>
<p>That early universe was apparently dense and incredibly hot, in a
state of thermodynamic equilibrium. But as it expanded it cooled, and as
it cooled, its symmetry was broken. The first differences appeared, and
the first gradients of temperature and pressure. At first, there seemed
little distinction between forces such as electricity and gravity. They
all appeared to blend together in the violent energies of a universe
that was nearly infinitely hot and infinitely dense. As it expanded and
cooled, however, the different fundamental forces each assumed its own
particular form. For example, before about 300,000 years after the big
bang, the electromagnetic force was too weak to bind electrons and
protons together into atoms. But after that time, the universe was cool
enough for electricity to begin sculpting the atomic structures studied
in modern physics and chemistry. At this point, matter and energy also
became quite distinct.</p>
<p>As the universe expanded, tiny initial differences multiplied, and
each of these forces began to operate in distinctive ways. Gravity
operated at large scales, and shaped the large structures of the
universe. Because matter was slow moving and heavy, it could be herded
together by gravity more easily than energy, which was light and fast
moving. So, as energy and matter separated, gravity got to work shaping
matter into large, complex structures, while energy, for the most part,
escaped its influence, except in extreme regions such as areas near
black holes. First, gravity gathered hydrogen and helium into huge
clouds. Then it began to squeeze each cloud into smaller and smaller
spaces, until pressure and temperature built up, particularly at the
center. When the cores reached about 10 million degrees, fusion
reactions began, and stars lit up. The fusion reactions at the center of
all stars counterbalanced the crushing force of gravity, negotiating a
sort of cosmic truce that is the foundation of every star. Once created,
stars provided stable, long-lived energy differentials, which offered
durable stores of free energy, or negentropy. Stars created stable hot
spots, dotted throughout the cooling early universe like raisins in a
dough. Today, the cosmic background radiation is just a few degrees
above absolute zero—this is the base temperature of the universe. But at
their centers, stars must have enormously high temperatures for fusion
to start—and in large stars, they can rise much higher than 10 million
degrees. In the regions near these hot points, complex entities could
begin to form, exploiting the huge temperature differentials between
stars and surrounding space, just as early life on Earth formed around
volcanic vents deep in the sea. As Paul Davies puts it: “Matter and
energy in far-from-equilibrium open systems have a propensity to seek
out higher and higher levels of organization and complexity.”4</p>
<p>On Earth, the temperature differential between our sun and
surrounding space provides the free energy needed to create most forms
of complexity, including ourselves; energies created early in the
history of our solar system drive the internal heat battery of Earth,
which drives plate tectonics. These differentials enable energy to flow,
and energy flows make patterns possible. And given enough time, the mere
possibility of pattern makes it likely that patterns of many different
kinds will eventually appear.</p>
<p>According to this line of argument, the expansion of the universe,
which allowed the early universe to cool and diversify, is the ultimate
source of all temperature and pressure differentials, and therefore of
the free energy needed to create order. We can put this argument
slightly differently. At its moment of origin, the universe was so small
and so homogenous that there were few possible disordered states; it was
like a pack of cards with just one card. Expansion created a larger
space and new possibilities for disorder, and these possibilities
multiplied as the universe kept expanding. As a general rule, the larger
a system, the greater the possible entropy; just as, to continue the
analogy, a larger pack of cards increases the number of possible
disordered states.5 Thus, while the second law of thermodynamics
suggests that entropy will always increase, the expansion of the
universe seems to ensure that there will always be more steps inserted
on the path down the thermodynamic escalator toward the state of
complete disorder that lies at the bottom. Whatever caused the universe
to expand is also in some sense the source of order and pattern.</p>
<p>After the first problem—explaining how order of any kind is
possible—is addressed, the second problem remains. How did complex
entities emerge, and, once they had emerged, how did they sustain
themselves long enough to be noticed by us (or to be us)? Paradoxically,
the tendency toward increasing entropy—the drive toward disorder—may
itself be the engine that creates order. It creates order on the way to
creating disorder. Poetically, we can think of the steady increase in
entropy as an attempt by the universe to return to its initial state of
thermodynamic equilibrium; many creation myths similarly describe the
breaking of an original unity, whose divided parts try to return to
their initial state. In Plato’s Symposium, one of the proposed
explanations of love between men and women is that it was created when
the gods split a hermaphroditic being into two different creatures,
whose attempts to reunite created all future generations of humans. The
drive toward disorder seems to create new forms of order, just as the
energy of falling water can cause droplets of water to splash upward, or
a river’s current can create eddies in which small amounts of water flow
against the main current.</p>
<p>At a local scale, and in the short run, complex entities seem to
reverse the workings of the second law of thermodynamics by increasing
order. But viewed within the larger environment from which they draw
free energy, they clearly actually increase entropy by speeding up the
transformation of free energy into unusable forms of heat. Thus
complexity is, in a sense, a cunning way for the second law of
thermodynamics to work more efficiently toward its bleak goal of a
universe without order.6 Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers have
applied the curious term dissipative to the complex structures described
here.7 What complex structures do is to handle huge flows of energy and,
in the process, dissipate large amounts of free energy, thereby
increasing entropy overall. Though they appear to reduce entropy
momentarily and locally they in fact generate entropy more effectively
than do simpler structures, facilitating the deadly workings of the
second law.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, creating order is not easy. Somehow or other,
significant flows of energy need to be concentrated and focused in ways
that generate pockets of increased order. Complex phenomena require a
constant throughput of energy to help them climb entropy’s remorseless
down escalator. So the existence of stable differentials to guarantee a
steady supply of energy, such as the temperature and pressure
differentials available near stars, is an essential precondition for
complexity. What is not clear is whether there exist mechanisms that
actively seek out complexity. Does the presence of differentials and
disequilibria actively drive matter and energy toward complexity? Or do
they merely make it possible? Does complexity work like natural
selection, through the random generation of structures that, once they
have appeared, become locked into place simply because they fit their
environment well? Or does the second law create complexity through a
devious cosmological cunning of its own?</p>
<p>Whatever the source of order, its creation, whether in the Sun or the
stock exchange, requires creating structures that can channel and
control large flows of energy without falling apart. This is an
extremely difficult trick. And that difficulty explains why ordered
entities are fragile and rare, and why they stand out against a
background that is much simpler. Roughly speaking, the more complex a
phenomenon is, the denser the energy flows it must juggle and the more
likely it is to break down. So we should expect that as entities become
more complex, they become less stable, shorter-lived, and rarer. Perhaps
even a slight increase in complexity can sharply increase their
fragility and, therefore, their scarcity. Of all complex chemicals in
existence, only a minute fraction have ever formed living organisms; of
all living organisms, án even smaller proportion has formed into
intelligent, networked species such as ourselves. (Table 4.1 offers some
evidence for these generalizations.) But it is also clear that the
likelihood of complex entities’ appearing would be greatly increased if
instead of relying on random changes to generate such structures by
accident, we could identify laws that tended to actively create such
structures. At present, we simply do not know whether there are such
laws, though the emerging science of complexity is attempting to
identify them.</p>
<p>What we can do is to describe some of the ways in which complex
structures emerge. The fundamental rule seems to be that complexity
normally emerges step by step, linking already existing patterns into
larger and more complex patterns at different scales. Once achieved,
some patterns seem to lock their constituents into new arrangements that
are more stable and more durable than the simpler arrangements from
which they are created. Such processes create the hierarchy of different
levels of complexity that we observe in the universe, because at each
scale, new rules of construction and change seem to come into play.
These are known as emergent properties, because they do not seem to be
derived from the properties of the original components; instead, they
apparently emerge as these components are assembled into a larger
structure. The word universe is a verbal structure consisting of eight
letters. But its meaning cannot be deduced just by knowing the letters
used to construct it. Its meaning is an emergent property. Similarly in
chemistry, the properties of water cannot be explained by describing how
hydrogen and oxygen behave, yet water is formed by combining molecules
of hydrogen and oxygen. Its properties emerge only when atoms of
hydrogen and oxygen are combined into water molecules.8 The myriad
different ways in which these rules play out at different scales and at
different degrees of complexity provide the subject matter for the
various disciplines of modern knowledge. Each deals with the rules that
emerge at new levels of complexity, from particle physics to chemistry,
biology, ecology, and history.</p>
<p>Being complex creatures ourselves, we know from personal experience
how hard it is to climb the down escalator, to work against the
universal slide into disorder, so we are inevitably fascinated by other
entities that appear to do the same thing. Thus this theme—the
achievement of order despite, and perhaps with the aid of, the second
law of thermodynamics—is woven through all parts of the story told here.
The endless waltz of chaos and complexity provides one of this book’s
unifying ideas.</p>
