<h4 id="for-and-against-big-history">FOR AND AGAINST BIG HISTORY</h4>
<p>Specialists in many fields, from geology to archaeology and
prehistory, will find it quite natural to look at the past on very large
scales. But not everyone will be persuaded that big history is worth
doing. Particularly to professional historians, the idea of exploring
the past on such huge timescales can seem overambitious and perhaps
simply impossible, a diversion from the real tasks of historical
scholarship. In the last part of this introduction, I will respond to
four main reservations that I have encountered.</p>
<p>The first is common, particularly among professional historians. It
is that on large scales, history must thin out. It must lose detail,
texture, particularity, and substance. Eventually, it must become
vacuous. To be sure, on large scales, themes and problems familiar to
professional historians may vanish, just as the details of a familiar
landscape may disappear as one looks down from an airplane as it climbs.
In a big history course, the French Revolution may get no more than a
passing mention. But there are compensations. As the frame through which
we view the past widens, features of the historical landscape that were
once too large to fit in can be seen whole. We can begin to see the
continents and oceans of the past, as well as the villages and roadways
of national and regional histories. Frames of any kind exclude more than
they reveal. And this is particularly true of the conventional time
frames of modern historiography, which normally extend from a few years
to a few centuries. Perhaps the most astonishing thing the conventional
frames hide is humanity itself. Even on time frames of several thousand
years, it is difficult to ask questions about the broader significance
of human history within an evolving biosphere. Yet in a world with
nuclear weapons and ecological problems that cross all national borders,
we desperately need to see humanity as a whole. Accounts of the past
that focus primarily on the divisions between nations, religions, and
cultures are beginning to look parochial and anachronistic—even
dangerous. So, it is not true that history becomes vacuous at large
scales. Familiar objects may vanish, but new and important objects and
problems come into view. And their presence can only enrich the
discipline.</p>
<p>A second possible objection is that to write big history, historians
will have to move beyond the boundaries of the discipline. Of course,
this is true. Synoptic studies like this book are risky because the
author depends on secondary sources and on other synoptic studies. As a
result, there will inevitably be blunders and misunderstandings: error
is built into the project. Indeed, it is part of the process of
learning. To understand your own country, you must travel beyond its
borders at least once in your life. You will not understand everything
you see; but you may begin to see your own country in a new light. The
same is true of history. To understand what is distinctive about human
history, we must have some idea of how a biologist or a geologist might
approach the subject. We cannot become biologists or geologists, and our
understanding of these fields will have its limits; but we do have to
use as skillfully as we can the expertise of specialists in other
fields. And we have much to learn from their different perspectives on
the past. Excessive respect for disciplinary boundaries has hidden many
possibilities for intellectual synergy between disciplines. I will
argue, for example, that we need the vision of a biologist to see what
is truly distinctive about our type of animal, Homo sapiens.</p>
<p>Third, it may be objected that big history proposes to create a new
“grand narrative” just when we have learned the futility, even the
danger, of grand narratives. Will not a big history metanarrative crowd
out alternative histories—of minorities, of regions, of particular
nations or ethnic groups?9 Perhaps a fragmented vision of the past (a
“jeweler’s-eye” view, in the phrase used by the anthropologists George
Marcus and Michael Fischer) is the only one that can do real justice to
the richness of human experience.10 Natalie Zemon Davis makes the point
well:</p>
<p>The question remains whether a single master narrative is an adequate
goal for global history. I think not. Master narratives are especially
vulnerable to be taken over by patterns characteristic of the
historian’s time and place, however useful they may be for accounting
for some of the historical evidence. If a new decentred global history
is discovering important alternative historical paths and trajectories,
then it might also do well to let its big stories be alternate or
multiple. The challenge for global history is to place these narratives
creatively within an interactive frame.11</p>
<p>Once again, the charge is at least partly true. Narratives of some
kind seem unavoidable when looking at the past on large scales, and they
will certainly be shaped by contemporary concerns. Nevertheless, it is a
mistake for historians to shun these large narratives, however grand
they may seem. Like it or not, people will look for, and find, large
stories, because they can provide a sense of meaning. As William Cronon
has written of environmental history: “When we describe human activities
within an ecosystem, we seem always to tell stories about them. Like all
historians, we configure the events of the past into causal
sequences—stories—that order and simplify those events to give them new
meanings. We do so because narrative is the chief literary form that
tries to find meaning in an overwhelmingly crowded and disordered
chronological reality.”12 If paid intellectuals are too finicky to shape
these stories, they will flourish all the same; but the intellectuals
will be ignored and will eventually disenfranchise themselves. This is
an abdication of responsibility particularly as intellectuals have
played such a crucial role in creating many of today’s metanarratives.
Metanarratives exist, they are powerful, and they are potent. We may be
able to domesticate them; but we will never eradicate them. Besides,
while grand narratives are powerful, subliminal grand narratives can be
even more powerful. Yet a “modern creation myth” already exists just
below the surface of modern knowledge. It exists in the dangerous form
of poorly articulated and poorly understood fragments of modern
knowledge that have undermined traditional accounts of reality without
being integrated into a new vision of reality. Only when a modern
creation myth has been teased out into a coherent story will it really
be possible to take the next step: of criticizing it, deconstructing it,
and perhaps improving it. In history as in building, construction must
precede deconstruction. We must see the modern creation myth before we
can criticize it. And we must articulate it before we can see it. Ernest
Gellner made this point well in the introduction to his attempt at a
synoptic view of history, Plough, Sword, and Book (1991):</p>
<p>The aim of the present volume is simple. It is to spell out, in the
sharpest and perhaps exaggerated outline, a vision of human history
which has been assuming shape of late, but which has not yet been
properly codified. The attempt to bring it to the surface is not made
because the author has any illusions about knowing it to be true: he
does not. Definitive and final truth is not granted to theories in
general. In particular, it is unlikely to attach to theories covering an
infinite diversity of extremely complex facts, well beyond the reach of
any one scholar. The vision is formulated in the hope that its clear and
forceful statement will make possible its critical examination.13</p>
<p>Besides, a “grand narrative” of the kind offered in this book may
prove surprisingly capacious. In the global “truth” market of the
twenty-first century, all narratives face stiff competition. The many
detailed stories of the past already taught in our schools and
universities ensure that a modern creation myth will emerge not as a
single monolithic story but rather as a large and ramshackle cycle of
stories, each of which can be told in many ways and with many variants.
Indeed, it may turn out that the very large narratives create more space
for alternative accounts of the past that struggle to survive within
existing (and less ample) history syllabi. As Patrick O’Brien has
written, “Hopefully as more historians risk writing on a global scale,
the field will achieve a reputation and produce competing metanarratives
to which the overwhelming flow of parish, regional and national
histories could be reconnected.”14</p>
<p>The fourth objection is closely related to the third: is not a
narrative on this huge scale bound to make exaggerated truth claims? I
have found in teaching big history that students struggle to find a
balance between two extreme positions. On the one hand, they are tempted
to suppose that a modern, “scientific” account of origins is true, while
all earlier accounts were more or less false. On the other hand, faced
with some of the uncertainties of modern accounts of the past, they may
be tempted to think that this is “just one more story.”</p>
<p>Thinking of a big history narrative as a modern creation myth is a
good way of helping students to find the epistemological point of
balance between these extremes. For it is a reminder, first, that all
accounts of reality are provisional. Many of the stories we tell today
will seem quaint and childish in a few centuries, just as many elements
of traditional creation myths seem naive today. But by acknowledging
this, we do not commit ourselves to a nihilistic relativism. All
knowledge systems, from modern science to those embedded in the most
ancient of creation myths, can be thought of as maps of reality. They
are never just true or false. Perfect descriptions of reality are
unattainable, unnecessary, and too costly for learning organisms,
including humans. But workable descriptions are indispensable. So
knowledge systems, like maps, are a complex blend of realism,
flexibility, usefulness, and inspiration. They must offer a description
of reality that conforms in some degree to commonsense experience. But
that description must also be useful. It must help solve the problems
that need to be solved by each community, whether these be spiritual,
psychological, political, or mechanical.15</p>
<p>In their day, all creation myths offered workable maps of reality,
and that is why they were believed. They made sense of what people knew.
They contained much good, empirical knowledge; and their large
structures helped people place themselves within a wider reality. But
each map had to build on the knowledge and fulfill the needs of a
particular society. And that is why they don’t necessarily count as
“true” outside their home environments. A modern creation myth need not
apologize for being equally parochial. It must start with modern
knowledge and modern questions, because it is designed for people who
live in the modern world. We need to try to understand our universe even
if we can be certain that our attempts can never fully succeed. So, the
strongest claim we can make about the truth of a modern creation myth is
that it offers a unified account of origins from the perspective of the
early twenty-first century.</p>
<p>FURTHER READING ON BIG HISTORY</p>
<p>Listed below are a number of works in English that explore the past
on scales larger than those of world history, or try to see human
history in its wider context, or provide methodological frameworks for
such attempts. This is a wide definition of “big history,” and there are
doubtless many other works that could be included under it. The authors
come from many different fields, and the books vary greatly in approach
and quality, so there is plenty of room for argument as to which do and
which do not really count as big history books. This preliminary
bibliography is based on a list first compiled by Fred Spier. It
excludes books so technical that they cannot possibly be of use to
historians or general readers. It also excludes a vast number of books
that operate at large scales, and have much to offer historians, but do
not try to move across multiple timescales.</p>
