DATING TECHNIQUES, CHRONOLOGIES, AND TIMELINES</h4>
<p>At the core of the modern creation myth, as in any story, there is a
timeline. How was the modern timeline constructed? And how can we begin
to understand its many different scales?</p>
<p>CONSTRUCTING A MODERN TIMELINE</p>
<p>One of the most astonishing features of the modern creation story is
that it confidently describes events that happened billions of years
before humans existed. Many of these chronological details have come
into focus only in the past few decades, so the timeline behind the
story told in this book is, in many parts, very recent. How was it
constructed?</p>
<p>Where written records exist, dating is not a great problem, and
modern historians have relied mainly on written records to construct
their accounts of the past. But things are different when we deal with
larger time spans not covered by written records. Even fifty years ago,
attempts to construct such timelines would have been vastly more
difficult than they are today. Until the middle of the twentieth
century, it seemed that precise knowledge of the distant past was
impossible. We might be able to determine the relative order of events
(such as the sequence in which particular rocks had been laid down), but
there seemed no way of determining absolute dates.</p>
<p>In the Christian world, the Bible was regarded as a primary source
for ancient dates until as late as the nineteenth century. Estimates for
the moment of creation were established by adding up the dates of all
the generations listed in the Bible. Such calculations suggested that
God had made the Earth about 6,000 years ago. In the seventeenth
century, as noted in chapter 1, one British scholar concluded that
humans had been created at 9:00 AM on 23 October 4004 BCE. But even in
the seventeenth century, some scholars with an interest in geology
realized that the earth had to be older than that. For example, they
became aware that fossil objects found high in mountain regions seemed
to be the remains of ancient fish, which suggested that the mountains
they were in must have risen up from sea level. Such changes, the
scholars thought, must have taken longer than 6,000 years. By the
nineteenth century, geologists were getting used to the idea of much
larger timescales, and they were growing very skilled at identifying
relative dates. They could tell which layer of rock had been laid down
first, knowledge that in turn enabled them to put fossils in sequence to
describe the rough stages of evolutionary history. But there seemed to
be no precise way of determining absolute dates. One influential attempt
to fix the age of the earth was that of William Thompson (Lord Kelvin).
He argued in the 1860s that the earth had existed for less than 100
million years, and perhaps as little as 20 million years, based on his
assumption that the earth and Sun had once been molten balls of matter
that had cooled to their present temperatures. To estimate their age,
Lord Kelvin calculated how long this cooling would have taken. He was
wrong, because he did not understand the role of radioactivity, which
maintained the internal heat of both bodies (though in different ways).
Indeed, it was an understanding of radioactivity that eventually made it
possible to determine precise absolute dates for the modern creation
story.1</p>
<p>Radiometric dating techniques exploit a feature of all radioactive
materials, including many isotopes of normally stable chemicals, such as
carbon.2 Many radioactive elements contain large numbers of protons and
neutrons in the nuclei of their atoms. Because protons have a positive
charge, they repel each other electrically; the more of them there are
crammed into a single nucleus, the greater the repulsive force.
Eventually, these repulsive forces can weaken the strong nuclear forces
that hold nuclei together; for this reason, large nuclei tend to be more
fragile than small nuclei. But even smaller nuclei can be unstable in
certain configurations. Periodically, the nuclei of radioactive elements
just start falling apart. They eject small numbers of protons and
neutrons, and sometimes a single electron or positron; in so doing, they
turn into different elements. This process, known as radioactive decay,
continues until the original material has been transmuted, step by
radioactive step, into a stable element, such as lead. Such decay occurs
with great statistical regularity; though we can never predict when a
particular nucleus will break down (just as we can never predict the
outcome of a particular coin toss), we can be very precise about the
behavior of large numbers of radioactive events. Thus we can estimate
how rapidly large amounts of material will decay. This rate is normally
calculated in half-lives. For example, the half-life of uranium 238 (the
most common isotope of uranium) is ca. 4.5 billion years, or slightly
less than the age of the earth. This means that if we start with a newly
formed lump of uranium 238 (created, perhaps, in a supernova), after 4.5
billion years about half of it will have broken down into other
elements. (The fact that so much of the uranium on Earth appears to be
about 4.56 billion years old is one reason for thinking that a supernova
exploded in our part of the galaxy just before our solar system formed.)
The half-lives of radioactive elements vary greatly. For example, the
half-life of carbon 14 (a rare isotope of carbon) is 5,715 years, which
is why archaeologists use it to date events that occurred up to ca.
40,000 years ago.3 For earlier dates, too little of the original carbon
14 is left for accurate analysis, leading to anomalous results; so other
methods have to be used.</p>
<p>The statistical regularity of radioactive decay enables us to
calculate when a particular lump of matter containing radioactive
material was formed. By using such techniques, we can say, for example,
that the earth was formed 4.56 billion years ago, or that the Cambrian
era lasted from about 570 to 510 million years ago. The technical
details are complex, but the general principle is simple enough. If you
take a lump of radioactive material, you can measure what proportion of
it has broken down into other elements, and from that figure you can
calculate how long the lump has existed. There is always a certain
amount of unreliability in these calculations, but even the degree of
reliability can be estimated with some precision. The principles of
radiometric dating were first developed in the United States by Willard
Libby, in the 1950s. Since that time, the techniques have been improved
greatly. As a result, since the mid-twentieth century, archaeologists,
geologists, paleontologists, and astronomers have been able to calculate
precise absolute dates for many major events in the remote past of our
planet and solar system. Radiometric dating techniques provide many of
the more important dates for the modern timeline.</p>
<p>Molecular dating is a more recent technique, developed first in the
1980s; it is used mainly to determine the evolutionary distance between
two related species (see chapter 6). It works by comparing similar
genetic material (such as DNA) from two organisms and then estimating
the difference between the two samples. The calculation of many
estimates of this kind has shown that much genetic change is
statistically random; thus, like the breakdown of radioactive materials,
it can function as a sort of clock. Scientists first used molecular
clocks to determine when the human and ape lines diverged, and they came
up with the scandalously short result of ca. 5 to 7 million years ago.
The rapid acceptance of this date by paleontologists greatly enhanced
the credibility of the technique, which is now used to date many other
important processes, such as the date of human migrations to different
parts of the world.</p>
<p>The big bang poses its own chronological problems. Edwin Hubble
showed that the universe was expanding, and he also showed that it was
possible, in principle, to calculate the rate of expansion. To undertake
this calculation, he first had to determine the distance between
galaxies and the rate at which they were moving apart. Neither task is
easy, and the problem is further complicated because the rate of
expansion has probably changed over time, influenced by gravity or
perhaps (as recent studies suggest) by some form of “vacuum energy.”
Hubble’s first attempt to calculate the rate of expansion (the Hubble
constant) suggested that the universe was only 2 billion years
old—clearly an impossible figure, as Earth itself was thought to be at
least 4.5 billion years old. Modern estimates put the origin of the
universe at about 13 billion years ago. This date is (just) consistent
with dates for the oldest known stars (about 12 billion years old), and
with the absence of any older radiometric dates. The most recent
studies, based on evidence released in 2003 using the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), give the extraordinarily precise date
of 13.7 billion years ago for the big bang. The same studies suggest
that the first stars lit up a mere 200 million years later, so it is no
surprise that the estimated ages of the oldest stars have sometimes
seemed dangerously close to estimates for the age of the universe
itself.</p>
<p>UNDERSTANDING LARGE TIMESCALES</p>
<p>Grasping the scales of the modern creation myth is extremely
difficult for those not used to dealing with large timescales. But this
is not a problem unique to the modern creation story. Some Hindu and
Buddhist chronologies of the universe’s history are even more
extravagant than those of modern science.</p>
<p>Suppose, O Monks—the Buddha once told his followers—there was a huge
rock of one solid mass, one mile long, one mile wide, one mile high,
without split or flaw. And at the end of every hundred years a man
should come and rub against it once with a silken cloth. Then that huge
rock would wear off and disappear quicker than a world-period [kalpa].
But of such world-periods, O Monks, many have passed away, many
hundreds, many thousands, many hundred thousands.4</p>
<p>To really grasp the scale of the modern creation myth, we need to
make a similar imaginative effort. This appendix includes several
timelines that may help the reader become more familiar with the
different timescales of the modern creation story.</p>
<p>The earliest parts of the book figure dates in relation to the
present. Thus, the universe was probably created about 13 billion years
ago, and the earth about 4.6 billion years ago, while the earliest
evidence for multicellular organisms appears about 600 million years
ago, and the earliest skeletal evidence for the existence of hominines
(the bipedal primates from which modern humans are descended) appears
about 4 million years ago (though recent finds are pushing these dates
back to about 6 million years). As we approach the era of human history,
we use this system more formally, adopting the archaeologists’
terminology of dates BP (before the present). Strictly speaking, such
dates, if based on radiometric dating techniques, are calculated “before
1950.” For all dates after ca. 5,000 years ago (from chapter 9 on,
generally speaking), I use the more familiar system of BCE (before the
common era) and CE (common era), which are equivalent to the traditional
Christian dating system of BC and AD. To translate from dates BP into
dates BCE, simply subtract 2,000 years. Thus, 5000 BP is equivalent to
3000 BCE.</p>
<p>What follows is a brief summary of the modern story of creation, and
three different chronologies that may help the reader keep track of the
book’s vast chronological scale. Scattered through the book are eight
timelines at different scales, which may also help familiarize the
reader with the multiple timescales of this story.</p>
<p>The Core Story</p>
<p>What follows is just one possible attempt to summarize the story told
in the rest of this book.</p>
<p>Thirteen billion (13,000,000,000) years ago there was nothing. There
wasn’t even emptiness. Time did not exist, nor did space. In this
nothing, there occurred an explosion, and within a split second,
something did exist. The early universe was fantastically hot—a searing
cloud of energy and matter, much hotter than the interior of a sun. For
a trillionth of a second it expanded faster than the speed of light,
growing from the size of an atom to the size of a galaxy. Then the rate
of expansion slowed, but the universe has continued expanding to the
present day. As the early universe expanded, its temperature dropped.
After about 300,000 years, it was cool enough for atoms of hydrogen and
helium to form. Within about a billion years, huge clouds of hydrogen
and helium began to gather and then collapse in on themselves under the
pressure of gravity. As the center of these clouds heated up, atoms
fused together violently like vast hydrogen bombs, and the first stars
lit up. Hundreds of billions of stars appeared, gathered in the huge
communities we call galaxies. The early universe consisted of little
more than hydrogen and helium, but inside stars, and in the violent
death agonies of large stars, new elements were created. And over time,
more complex elements began to appear in interstellar space. Our own sun
was formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a cloud of gas and matter
that contained many of these new elements, in addition to hydrogen and
helium. The planets of our solar system were formed at the same time as
the Sun, from the debris left over from the Sun’s creation.</p>
<p>The early earth was a dangerous place, bombarded by meteorites and so
hot that much of it was molten. Over a billion years, however, it began
to cool, and as it did so, water rained down on its surface to create
the first seas. By 3.5 billion years ago, complex chemical reactions,
probably taking place around deep-sea volcanoes, had created simple
forms of life. Over the next 3.5 billion years, these simple,
single-cell organisms became more and more diverse, evolving through
natural selection. Quite early, some learned to extract energy from
sunlight through the process of photosynthesis. As other organisms began
to feed on the photosynthesizers, sunlight became the main “battery” of
life on earth. Powered by the Sun, living organisms spread through the
seas and eventually over the land, creating an interconnected web of
life that had a profound impact on the atmosphere, the land, and the
sea. From about 600 million years ago, there began to appear larger
organisms, each made up of billions of individual cells. A mere 250,000
years ago, our own species appeared, having evolved from apelike
ancestors through the same unpredictable processes of natural
selection.</p>
<p>Though they evolved in the same way as other animals, humans turned
out to be unusually good at extracting resources from the environment.
Their advantage lay in their ability to share information and ideas with
a precision that no other animal could match. And over time, their
shared knowledge accumulated, enabling each generation to build on the
knowledge of earlier generations. The number of humans grew as they
learned how to live in more and more diverse environments, first in
Africa; then in Eurasia, Australia, and the Americas; and eventually in
the myriad islands of the Pacific. These global migrations took many
tens of thousands of years. Eventually, beginning a mere ten thousand
years ago, humans in some parts of the world began to manipulate their
environments so successfully that they could produce ever greater
amounts of food from a given area of land. Using the technologies we
refer to as agriculture, they began to settle down in small village
communities. As populations grew, the number and size of villages also
grew until the first large cities appeared, about 5,000 years ago. These
large, dense settlements required new and complex forms of regulation to
prevent disputes and coordinate the activities of many people living at
close quarters. In this way there appeared the first states, groups of
powerful individuals capable of regulating the activities of the
community as a whole. Conflict appeared both within and between
communities, as different groups competed for resources and power. But
as communities also exchanged information, the technological resources
available to humanity as a whole continued to accumulate. Over several
thousand years, the size, the reach, and the populations of societies
with states expanded, until eventually most humans were living within
state-based societies with cities and some form of agriculture. As their
numbers and technological skills grew, so did their impact on the
biosphere—the community of other organisms on earth. In some regions,
the impact of human activities such as irrigation or deforestation
proved so damaging that the local environment could no longer support
large human populations, and entire civilizations collapsed.</p>
<p>As technologies of communication and transportation improved, more
and more communities came into contact with each other. About 500 years
ago, for the first time, these changes connected human communities in
all parts of the world. For many communities this coming together was
disastrous; it brought conquest, disease, and exploitation, sometimes of
the most brutal kind. But the merging of regional communities also
helped trigger new technological breakthroughs that could now be shared
throughout the world. In the past two centuries, new technologies,
beginning with the harnessing of steam power, have given human societies
access to the vast sources of energy locked up in fossil fuels such as
coal and oil. Human populations have grown more rapidly than ever
before, and the problems of administering these huge communities, and
coping with conflicts between them, have demanded the creation of even
more powerful and complex state systems. Today, human numbers are so
great, and the impact of humans on the biosphere is so significant, that
we are in real danger of doing serious damage to the environment that is
our home. Such damage could lead to a global collapse of human
civilizations and have devastating effects on other organisms as well.
At the same time, the ability of humans to share knowledge is now
greater than ever before, and it may be that new technologies and new
ways of organizing human societies will enable us to avoid the dangers
created by our ecological virtuosity.</p>
<p>A Chronology for the Whole of Time</p>
<p>The first chronology gives a list of (approximate) dates. These cover
some of the fundamental changes and transitions dealt with in the
text.</p>
<p>History of the Universe before Our Sun (from 13 Billion Years to 4.5
Billion Years Ago)</p>
<p>• ca. 13,000,000,000 (13 billion) years ago: The big bang, the origin
of the universe; the universe expands to the size of a galaxy; many
vital events occur during the next few seconds; protons and electrons
appear in the first second.</p>
<p>• ca. 300,000 years later: The universe has cooled to about a few
thousand degrees Celsius, and electrons are captured by protons to form
the first (electrically neutral) atoms, of hydrogen and helium; cosmic
background radiation (CBR) is released as the universe becomes
electrically neutral (the detection of CBR in 1964 led to general
acceptance of the big bang theory of the origins of the universe).</p>
<p>• ca. 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) years after the big bang: The first
stars light up as hydrogen atoms begin to fuse into helium atoms at the
center of huge clouds of gas, under the pressure of gravity; billions of
stars cluster into galaxies; new elements form in the interior of stars
(all elements up to iron, with 26 protons) or in the vast explosions of
dying stars known as supernovae (elements up to uranium, with 92
protons).</p>
<p>• ca. 4,600,000,000 (4.6 billion) years ago: The Sun, Earth, and
solar system form from clouds of stardust containing the debris of older
stars.</p>
<p>History of Earth and Life on Earth (from 4.5 Billion Years Ago)</p>
<p>• ca. 3,500,000,000 (3.5 billion) years ago: The first living
organisms on earth appear; DNA is the basis of reproduction, and still
present in every cell of every living thing (it reproduces by making
almost perfect copies of itself; change and evolution are possible
because the copies are not absolutely perfect, and when imperfect copies
manage to survive, their descendants eventually form new species); early
life consists of prokaryotes, little more than strands of DNA floating
inside a protective container, or cell; photosynthesizing cells use the
energy of sunlight and produce oxygen.</p>
<p>• ca. 2,500,000,000 (2.5 billion) years ago: Free oxygen, produced by
photosynthesizing organisms, begins to change the earth’s
atmosphere.</p>
<p>• ca. 1,500,000,000 (1.5 billion) years ago: The first complex cells
or eukaryotes appear, which have nuclei containing DNA and complex
internal organelles (all complex life-forms evolve from eukaryotes);
groups of cells start clustering together into large colonies to form
the first multicelled creatures; with sexual reproduction, in which two
not quite identical organisms swap their DNA to form a new creature,
different from either parent, the pace of change accelerates.</p>
<p>• ca. 600,000,000 (600 million) years ago: The first fossils of
larger, multicellular creatures appear during the Cambrian era;
formation of an ozone layer, from oxygen high up in the atmosphere,
makes it easier for life to evolve on land, as it shields the surface
from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the Sun, but not from its warmth
and light; life spreads to the land and air, as well as multiplying and
diversifying within the seas.</p>
<p>• ca. 65,000,000 (65 million) years ago: The extinction of the
dinosaurs occurs, probably as the result of an asteroid impact, whose
effects were similar to those of a nuclear war; mammals begin to replace
dinosaurs as dominant large land animals; the first primates appear,
tree-dwelling mammals with larger brains, dexterous hands, and
stereoscopic vision.</p>
<p>The Paleolithic Era of Human History (from ca. 7 million to ca.
10,000 Years Ago)</p>
<p>• ca. 7,000,000 (7 million) years ago: The first hominines evolve
from apes, distinguished by bipedalism.</p>
<p>• ca. 4,000,000 (4 million) years ago: Australopithecines emerge.</p>
<p>• ca. 2–1.5 million years ago: Homo habilis, the first member of our
genus, appears.</p>
<p>• ca. 1.8 million years ago: Homo ergaster/erectus develops.</p>
<p>• ca. 1 million years ago: Members of the species Homo erectus
migrate to southern parts of Eurasia.</p>
<p>• ca. 250,000 years ago: The appearance of the first modern humans,
probably with fully developed language: Homo sapiens.</p>
<p>• ca. 100,000 years ago: Modern humans move into the Near East, where
they probably encounter Neanderthals.</p>
<p>• ca. 60,000 years ago: The first colonization of Sahul/Australia by
modern humans.</p>
<p>• ca. 25,000 years ago: Modern humans move into Siberia;
Neanderthals, the only remaining nonhuman hominines, become extinct.</p>
<p>• ca. 13,000 years ago: The first clear evidence of colonization of
the Americas, across the Bering Straits.</p>
<p>The Holocene Era of Human History (the Past 10,000 Years)</p>
<p>• ca. 10,000–5,000 years ago: The last ice age ends; intensive
foraging technologies, some sedentary societies appear, along with early
forms of agriculture; populations begin to grow rapidly; there are early
signs of complexity and hierarchy, as large communities require new,
more complex forms of organization.</p>
<p>• ca. 5,000 years ago: The first cities, states, and agrarian
civilizations emerge; powerful elites control resources through
tribute-taking; these elites organize warfare, large-scale worship, and
monument building; writing is invented; agrarian civilizations spread
and become the most populous and powerful of human communities.</p>
<p>The Modern Era (the Past 500 Years-the Future)</p>
<p>• ca. 500 years ago: Afro-Eurasia and the Americas come together,
forming the largest “world zones” on earth; the first global system of
exchange is created.</p>
<p>• ca. 200 years ago: The first capitalist societies emerge in western
Europe; the Industrial Revolution exploits fossil fuels; there is huge
increase in the power, wealth, and influence of European states;
European imperialism dominates the globe.</p>
<p>• ca. 100 years ago: The Industrial Revolution begins to spread more
widely; conflict breaks out between leading capitalist states; a
communist backlash occurs.</p>
<p>• ca. 50 years ago: The first use of a nuclear weapon takes place
(humans learn to use the explosive power present at the origin of the
universe, and are in danger of destroying themselves and the rest of the
biosphere).</p>
<p>• ca. 4–5,000 million years into the future: The Sun begins to
die.</p>
<p>• Many billions of years further into the future: The universe will
decay into a state of featureless equilibrium.</p>
<p>Thirteen Billion Years in Thirteen Years</p>
<p>The second chronology also covers 13 billion years. However, it
collapses the timescales of modern cosmology by a factor of one billion,
reducing 13 billion years to 13 years. Doing this may make it easier to
grasp the crucial differences between different types of timescale.</p>
<p>History of the Universe before Our Sun: From 13 to ca. 4.5 Years
Ago</p>
<p>• The big bang occurs ca. 13 years ago.</p>
<p>• The first stars and galaxies appear by about 12 years ago.</p>
<p>• The Sun and solar system form about 4.5 years ago.</p>
<p>History of Earth and Life on Earth: From 4 Years to ca. 3 Weeks
Ago</p>
<p>• The first living organisms appear about 4 years ago.</p>
<p>• The first multicelled organisms appear about 7 months ago.</p>
<p>• Pangaea forms about 3 months ago.</p>
<p>• Dinosaurs are driven to extinction after a meteor impact about 3
weeks ago; mammals flourish.</p>
<p>The Paleolithic Era of Human History: From 3 Days Ago to 6 Minutes
Ago</p>
<p>• First hominines evolve in Africa about 3 days ago.</p>
<p>• First Homo sapiens evolve about 50 minutes ago in Africa.</p>
<p>• First humans reach Papua New Guinea/Australia about 26 minutes
ago.</p>
<p>• First humans reach Americas about 6 minutes ago.</p>
<p>The Holocene Era of Human History: From 6 Minutes Ago to 15 Seconds
Ago</p>
<p>• First agricultural communities flourish about 5 minutes ago.</p>
<p>• First literate urban civilizations appear about 3 minutes ago.</p>
<p>• Classical civilizations of China, Persia, India, and the
Mediterranean and the first agrarian civilizations in Americas emerge
about 1 minute ago.</p>
<p>• Mongol Empire briefly unites much of Eurasia about 24 seconds ago;
Black Death.</p>
<p>The Modern Era: The Past 15 Seconds</p>
<p>• Human communities are linked into a single “world system” about 15
seconds ago.</p>
<p>• The Industrial Revolution occurs about 6 seconds ago.</p>
<p>• Industrial Revolution spreads to Europe about 6 seconds ago.</p>
<p>• The First World War is fought about 2 seconds ago.</p>
<p>• Human populations reach 5, then 6 billion; the first atomic weapons
are used; humans walk on the Moon; and the electronic revolution occurs,
all within the last second.</p>
<p>So, at the end of 13 years, the universe would have existed for 13
years, and the earth for fewer than 5. Complex, multicelled organisms
would have existed for about 7 months, hominines for a mere 3 days, and
our own species, Homo sapiens, for a mere 50 minutes. Agricultural
societies would have existed for only 5 minutes, and the entire recorded
history of civilization for 3 minutes. The modern industrial
civilizations that dominate the world today would have existed for 6
seconds.</p>
<p>The Geological Timescale</p>
<p>The third chronology will be familiar to students of geology. It is
the geological timescale. You will undoubtedly come across references to
it, so it is worth getting used to its main features. Table A1 presents
one, highly simplified version. Don’t worry too much if the dates seem
to vary slightly from version to version; it’s the large picture that
matters.</p>
