<h4 id="chapter-l">CHAPTER L</h4>
<p>XVESSELS steamed up the Gulf of Akaba. Feisal landed, and with him
Jaafar, his staff, and Joyce, the fairy godmother. There came the
armoured cars, Goslett, Egyptian labourers and thousands of troops. To
repair the six weeks’ peace, Falkenhayn had been down to advise the
Turks, and his fine intelligence made them worthier our opposition. Maan
was a special command, under Behjet, the old G.O.C. Sinai. He had six
thousand infantry, a regiment of cavalry and mounted infantry, and had
entrenched Maan till it was impregnable according to the standard of
manœuvre war. A flight of aeroplanes operated daily thence. Great supply
dumps had been collected.</p>
<p>By now the Turkish preparations were complete; they began to move,
disclosing that their objective was Guweira, the best road for Akaba.
Two thousand infantry pushed out to Aba el Lissan, and fortified it.
Cavalry kept the outskirts, to contain a possible Arab counter-stroke
from the Wadi Musa side.</p>
<p>This nervousness was our cue. We would play with them and provoke
them to go for us in Wadi Musa, where the natural obstacles were so
tremendous that the human defending factor might behave as badly as it
liked, and yet hold the place against attack.</p>
<p>To bait the hook, the men of neighbouring Delagha were set busy. The
Turks, full of spirit, put in a counter-stroke, and suffered sharply. We
rubbed into the peasantry of Wadi Musa the rich booty now enjoyed by
their rivals of Delagha. Maulud, the old war-horse, went up with his
mule-mounted regiment, and quartered himself among the famous ruins of
Petra. The encouraged Liathena, under their one-eyed sheikh, Khalil,
began to foray out across the plateau, and to snap up by twos and threes
Turkish riding or transport animals, together with the rifles of their
occasional guards. This went on for weeks, while the irritated Turks
grew hotter and hotter.</p>
<p>We could also prick the Turks into discomfort by asking General
Salmond for his promised long-distance air raid on Maan. As it was
difficult, Salmond had chosen Stent, with other tried pilots of Rabegh
or Wejh, and told them to do their best. They had experience of forced
landing on desert surfaces and could pick out an unknown destination
across unmapped hills: Stent spoke Arabic perfectly. The flight had to
be air-contained, but its commander was full of resource and display,
like other bundles of nerves, who, to punish themselves, did outrageous
things. On this occasion he ordered low flying, to make sure the aim;
and profited by reaching Maan, and dropping thirty-two bombs in and
about the unprepared station. Two bombs into the barracks killed
thirty-five men and wounded fifty. Eight struck the engine-shed, heavily
damaging the plant and stock. A bomb in the General’s kitchen finished
his cook and his breakfast. Four fell on the aerodrome. Despite the
shrapnel our pilots and engines returned safely to their temporary
landing ground at Kuntilla above Akaba.</p>
<p>That afternoon they patched the machines, and after dark slept under
their wings. In the following dawn they were off once more, three of
them this time, to Aba el Lissan, where the sight of the great camp had
made Stent’s mouth water. They bombed the horselines and stampeded the
animals, visited the tents and scattered the Turks. As on the day
before, they flew low and were much hit, but not fatally. Long before
noon they were back in Kuntilla.</p>
<p>Stent looked over the remaining petrol and bombs, and decided they
were enough for one more effort. So he gave directions to everyone to
look for the battery which had troubled them in the morning. They
started in the midday heat. Their loads were so heavy they could get no
height, and therefore came blundering over the crest behind Aba el
Lissan, and down the valley at about three hundred feet. The Turks
always somnolent at noon, were taken completely by surprise. Thirty
bombs were dropped: one silenced the battery, the others killed dozens
of men and animals. Then the lightened machines soared up and home to El
Arish. The Arabs rejoiced: the Turks were seriously alarmed. Behjet
Pasha set his men to digging shelters, and when his aeroplanes had been
repaired, he disposed them innocuously about the plateau for camp
defence.</p>
<p>By air we had perturbed the Turks: by irritative raids we were luring
them towards a wrong objective. Our third resource to ruin their
offensive was to hinder the railway, whose need would make them split up
the striking force on defensive duties. Accordingly we arranged many
demolitions for mid-September.</p>
<p>I decided also to revive the old idea of mining a train. Something
more vigorous and certain than automatic mines was indicated, and I had
imagined a direct firing, by electricity, of a charge under the
locomotive. The British sappers encouraged me to try, especially General
Wright, the chief engineer in Egypt, whose experience took a sporting
interest in my irregularities. He sent me the recommended tools: an
exploder and some insulated cable. With them I went on board H.M.S.
Humber, our new guard-ship, and introduced myself to Captain Snagge, in
command.</p>
<p>Snagge was fortunate in his ship, which had been built for Brazil,
and was much more comfortably furnished than British monitors; and we
were doubly fortunate in him and in this, for he was the spirit of
hospitality. His inquiring nature took interest in the shore, and saw
the comic side even of our petty disasters. To tell him the story of a
failure was to laugh at it, and always for a good story he gave me a hot
bath, and tea with civilized trappings, free from every suspicion of
blown sand. His kindness and help served us in lieu of visits to Egypt
for repairs, and enabled us to hammer on against the Turks through month
after month of feckless disappointment.</p>
<p>The exploder was in a formidable locked white box, very heavy. We
split it open, found a ratchet handle, and pushed it down without
harming the ship. The wire was heavy rubber-insulated cable. We cut it
in half, fastened the ends to screw terminals on the box, and
transmitted shocks to one another convincingly. It worked.</p>
<p>I fetched detonators. We stuffed the free ends of the cable into one
and pumped the handle: nothing followed. We tried again and again
ineffectually, grieving over it. At last Snagge rang his bell for the
gunner warrant officer who knew all about circuits. He suggested special
electric detonators. The ship carried six, and gave me three of them. We
joined one up with our box, and when the handle was crashed down it
popped off beautifully. So I felt that I knew all about it and turned to
arrange the details of the raid.</p>
<p>Of targets, the most promising and easiest-reached seemed Mudowwara,
a water station eighty miles south of Maan. A smashed train there would
embarrass the enemy. For men, I would have the tried Howeitat; and, at
the same time, the expedition would test the three Haurani peasants whom
I had added to my personal followers. In view of the new importance of
the Hauran, there was need for us to learn its dialect, the construction
and jealousies of its clan-framework, and its names and roads. These
three fellows, Rahail, Assaf and Hemeid, would teach me their
home-affairs imperceptibly, as we rode on business, chatting.</p>
<p>To make sure of the arrested train required guns and machine-guns.
For the first, why not trench-mortars? For the second, Lewis guns?
Accordingly, Egypt chose two forceful sergeant-instructors from the Army
School at Zeitun, to teach squads of Arabs in Akaba how to use such
things. Snagge gave them quarters in his ship, since we had, as yet, no
convenient English camp ashore.</p>
<p>Their names may have been Yells and Brooke, but became Lewis and
Stokes after their jealously-loved tools. Lewis was an Australian, long,
thin and sinuous, his supple body lounging in unmilitary curves. His
hard face, arched eyebrows, and predatory nose set off the peculiarly
Australian air of reckless willingness and capacity to do something very
soon. Stokes was a stocky English yeoman, workmanlike and silent; always
watching for an order to obey.</p>
<p>Lewis, full of suggestion, emerged bursting with delight at what had
been well done whenever a thing happened. Stokes never offered opinion
until after action, when he would stir his cap reflectively, and
painstakingly recount the mistakes he must next time avoid. Both were
admirable men. In a month, without common language or interpreter, they
got on terms with their classes and taught them their empirical habit
appeared to agree with the spirit of our haphazard raids better than
complete scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>As we worked at the organization of the raid, our appetites rose.
Mudowwara station sounded vulnerable. Three hundred men might rush it
suddenly. That would be an achievement, for its deep well was the only
one in the dry sector below Maan. Without its water, the train service
across the gap would become uneconomic in load.</p>
