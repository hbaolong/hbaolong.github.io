<h4 id="chapter-c">CHAPTER C</h4>
<p>UPON this text my mind went weaving across its dusty space, amid the
sunbeam thoughts and their dancing motes of idea. Then I saw that this
preferring the Unknown to the God was a scapegoat idea, which lulled
only to a false peace. To endure by order, or because it was a duty —
that was easy. The soldier suffered only involuntary knocks; whereas our
will had to play the ganger till the workmen fainted, to keep in a safe
place and thrust others into danger. It might have been heroic to have
offered up my own life for a cause in which I could not believe: but it
was a theft of souls to make others die in sincerity for my graven
image. Because they accepted our message as truth, they were ready to be
killed for it; a condition which made their acts more proper than
glorious, a logical bastard fortitude, suitable to a profit and loss
balance of conduct. To invent a message, and then with open eye to
perish for its self-made image — that was greater.</p>
<p>The whole business of the movement seemed to be expressible only in
terms of death and life. Generally we were conscious of our flesh
because it hurt us. Joy came sharper from our long habitude of pain; but
our resources in suffering seemed greater than our capacity for
gladness. Lethargy played its part here. Both emotions were in our gift,
for our pain was full of eddies, confusing its purity.</p>
<p>A reef on which many came to a shipwreck of estimation was the vanity
that our endurance might win redemption, perhaps for all a race. Such
false investiture bred a hot though transient satisfaction, in that we
felt we had assumed another’s pain or experience, his personality. It
was triumph, and a mood of enlargement; we had avoided our sultry
selves, conquered our geometrical completeness, snatched a momentary
‘change of mind’.</p>
<p>Yet in reality we had borne the vicarious for our own sakes, or at
least because it was pointed for our benefit: and could escape from this
knowledge only by a make-belief in sense as well as in motive.</p>
<p>The self-immolated victim took for his own the rare gift of
sacrifice; and no pride and few pleasures in the world were so joyful,
so rich as this choosing voluntarily another’s evil to perfect the self.
There was a hidden selfishness in it, as in all perfections. To each
opportunity there could be only one vicar, and the snatching of it
robbed the fellows of their due hurt. Their vicar rejoiced, while his
brethren were wounded in their manhood. To accept humbly so rich a
release was imperfection in them: their gladness at the saving of its
cost was sinful in that it made them accessory, part-guilty of
inflicting it upon their mediator. His purer part, for the mediator,
might have been to stand among the crowd, to watch another win the
cleanness of a redeemer’s name. By the one road lay self-perfection, by
the other self-immolation, and a making perfect of the neighbour.
Hauptmann told us to take as generously as we gave: but rather we seemed
like the cells of a bee-comb, of which one might change, or swell
itself, only at the cost of all.</p>
<p>To endure for another in simplicity gave a sense of greatness. There
was nothing loftier than a cross, from which to contemplate the world.
The pride and exhilaration of it were beyond conceit. Yet each cross,
occupied, robbed the late-comers of all but the poor part of copying:
and the meanest of things were those done by example. The virtue of
sacrifice lay within the victim’s soul.</p>
<p>Honest redemption must have been free and child-minded. When the
expiator was conscious of the under-motives and the after-glory of his
act, both were wasted on him. So the introspective altruist appropriated
a share worthless, indeed harmful, to himself, for had he remained
passive, his cross might have been granted to an innocent. To rescue
simple ones from such evil by paying for them his complicated self would
be avaricious in the modern man. He, thought-riddled, could not share
their belief in others’ discharge through his agony, and they, looking
on him without understanding, might feel the shame which was the manly
disciple’s lot: or might fail to feel it and incur the double punishment
of ignorance.</p>
<p>Or was this shame, too, a self-abnegation, to be admitted and admired
for its own sake? How was it right to let men die because they did not
understand? Blindness and folly aping the way of right were punished
more heavily than purposed evil, at least in the present consciousness
and remorse of man alive. Complex men who knew how self-sacrifice
uplifted the redeemer and cast down the bought, and who held back in
this knowledge, might so let a foolish brother take the place of false
nobility and its later awakened due of heavier sentence. There seemed no
straight walking for us leaders in this crooked lane of conduct, ring
within ring of unknown, shamefaced motives cancelling or double-charging
their precedents.</p>
<p>Yet I cannot put down my acquiescence in the Arab fraud to weakness
of character or native hypocrisy: though of course I must have had some
tendency, some aptitude, for deceit, or I would not have deceived men so
well, and persisted two years in bringing to success a deceit which
others had framed and set afoot. I had had no concern with the Arab
Revolt in the beginning. In the end I was responsible for its being an
embarrassment to the inventors. Where exactly in the interim my guilt
passed from accessory to principal, upon what headings I should be
condemned, were not for me to say. Suffice it that since the march to
Akaba I bitterly repented my entanglement in the movement, with a
bitterness sufficient to corrode my inactive hours, but insufficient to
make me cut myself clear of it. Hence the wobbling of my will, and
endless, vapid complainings.</p>
