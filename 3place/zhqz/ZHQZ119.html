<h4 id="chapter-cviii">CHAPTER CVIII</h4>
<p>JUST at dawn our column marched. Of them one thousand were the Aba el
Lissan contingent: three hundred were Nuri Shaalan’s nomad horse. He had
also two thousand Rualla camel-riders: these we asked him to keep in
Wadi Sirhan. It seemed not wise, before the supreme day, to launch so
many disturbing Beduin among the villages of Hauran. The horsemen were
sheikhs, or sheikhs’ servants, men of substance, under control.</p>
<p>Affairs with Nuri and Feisal held me the whole day in Azrak: but
Joyce had left me a tender, the Blue Mist, by which on the following
morning I overtook the army, and found them breakfasting among the
grass-filled roughness of the Giaan el Khunna. The camels, joying to be
out of the barren circle of Azrak, were packing their stomachs hastily
with this best of food.</p>
<p>Joyce had bad news. Peake had rejoined, reporting failure to reach
the line, because of trouble with Arab encampments in the neighbourhood
of his proposed demolition. We had set store on breaking the Amman
railway, and the check was an offence. I left the car, took a load of
gun-cotton, and mounted my camel, to push in advance of the force. The
others made a detour to avoid harsh tongues of lava which ran down
westwards towards the railway; but we, Ageyl and others of the
well-mounted, cut straight across by a thieves’ path to the open plain
about the ruined Um el Jemal.</p>
<p>I was thinking hard about the Amman demolition, puzzled as to what
expedient would be quickest and best; and the puzzle of these ruins
added to my care. There seemed evidence of bluntness of mind in these
Roman frontier cities, Um el Jemal, Um el Surab, Umtaiye. Such
incongruous buildings, in what was then and now a desert cockpit,
accused their builders of insensitiveness; almost of a vulgar assertion
of man’s right (Roman right) to live unchanged in all his estate.
Italianate buildings — only to be paid for by taxing more docile
provinces — on these fringes of the world disclosed a prosaic blindness
to the transience of politics. A house which so survived the purpose of
its builder was a pride too trivial to confer honour upon the mind
responsible for its conception.</p>
<p>Um el Jemal seemed aggressive and impudent, and the railway beyond it
so tiresomely intact, that they blinded me to an air-battle between
Murphy in our Bristol Fighter and an enemy two-seater. The Bristol was
badly shot about before the Turk went down in flames. Our army were
delighted spectators, but Murphy, finding the damage too great for his
few materials at Azrak, went for repair to Palestine in the morning. So
our tiny Air Force was reduced to the B.E. 12, a type so out of date
that it was impossible for fighting, and little use for reconnaissance.
This we discovered on the day: meanwhile we were as glad as the army at
our man’s win.</p>
<p>Umtaiye was reached, just before sunset. The troops were five or six
miles behind, so as soon as our beasts had had a drink we struck off to
the railway, four miles downhill to the westward, thinking to do a
snatch-demolition. The dusk let us get close without alarm, and, to our
joy, we found that the going was possible for armoured cars: while just
before us were two good bridges.</p>
<p>These points decided me to return in the morning, with cars and more
gun-cotton, to abolish the larger, four-arched bridge. Its destruction
would give the Turks some days’ hard mending, and set us free of Amman
all the time of our first Deraa raid; thus the purpose of Peake’s
frustrated demolition would be filled. It was a happy discovery, and we
rode back, quartering the ground while the darkness gathered, to pick
the best car road.</p>
<p>As we climbed the last ridge, a high unbroken watershed which hid
Umtaiye completely from the railway and its possible watchmen, the fresh
north-east wind blew into our faces the warm smell and dust of ten
thousand feet; and from the crest the ruins appeared so startlingly
unlike themselves three hours before that we pulled up to gasp. The
hollow ground was festively spangled with a galaxy of little evening
fires, fresh-lighted, still twinkling with the flame reflections in
their smoke. About them men were making bread or coffee, while others
drove their noisy camels to and from the water.</p>
<p>I rode to the dark camp, the British one, and sat there with Joyce
and Winterton and Young, telling them of what we must do first thing in
the morning. Beside us lay and smoked the British soldiers, quietly
risking themselves on this expedition, because we ordered it. It was a
thing typical, as instinct with our national character as that babbling
laughing turmoil over there was Arab. In their crises the one race drew
in, the other spread.</p>
<p>In the morning, while the army breakfasted, and thawed the dawn-chill
from its muscles in the sun, we explained to the Arab leaders in council
the fitness of the line for a car-raid; and it was determined that two
armoured cars should run down to the bridge and attack it, while the
main body continued their march to Tell Arar on the Damascus Railway,
four miles north of Deraa. They would take post there, possessing the
line, at dawn to-morrow, September the seventeenth; and we with the cars
would have finished this bridge and rejoined them before that.</p>
<p>About two in the afternoon, as we drove towards the railway, we had
the great sight of a swarm of our bombing planes droning steadily up
towards Deraa on their first raid. The place had hitherto been carefully
reserved from air attack; so the damage among the unaccustomed,
unprotected, unarmed garrison was heavy. The morale of the men suffered
as much as the railway traffic: and till our onslaught from the north
forced them to see us, all their efforts went into digging bomb-proof
shelters.</p>
<p>We lurched across plots of grass, between bars and fields of rough
stone, in our two tenders and two armoured cars; but arrived all well
behind a last ridge, just this side of our target. On the rise south of
the bridge stood a stone blockhouse.</p>
<p>We settled to leave the tenders here, under cover. I transferred
myself, with one hundred and fifty pounds of gun-cotton, fused and
ready, to one armoured car; intending to drive passively down the valley
towards the bridge, till its arches, sheltering us from the fire of the
post, enabled me to lay and light the demolition charges. Meanwhile the
other, the active fighting car, would engage the blockhouse at short
range to cover my operation.</p>
<p>The two cars set out simultaneously. When they saw us the astonished
garrison of seven or eight Turks got out of their trenches, and, rifles
in hand, advanced upon us in open order: moved either by panic, by
misunderstanding, or by an inhuman unmixed courage.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the second car came into action against them: while
four other Turks appeared beside the bridge and shot at us. Our
machine-gunners ranged, and fired a short burst. One man fell, another
was hit: the rest ran a little way, thought better of it, and returned,
making friendly signs. We took their rifles, and sent them up valley to
the tenders, whose drivers were watching us keenly from their ridge. The
blockhouse surrendered at the same moment. We were very content to have
taken the bridge, and its section of track, in five minutes without
loss.</p>
<p>Joyce rushed down in his tender with more gun-cotton, and hastily we
set about the bridge, a pleasant little work, eighty feet long and
fifteen feet high, honoured with a shining slab of white marble, bearing
the name and titles of Sultan Abd el Hamid. In the drainage holes of the
spandrils six small charges were inserted zigzag, and with their
explosion all the arches were scientifically shattered; the demolition
being a fine example of that finest sort which left the skeleton of its
bridge intact indeed, but tottering, so that the repairing enemy had a
first labour to destroy the wreck, before they could attempt to
rebuild.</p>
<p>When we had finished, enemy patrols were near enough to give us fair
excuse for quitting. The few prisoners, whom we valued for Intelligence
reasons, were given place on our loads; and we bumped off. Unfortunately
we bumped too carelessly in our satisfaction, and at the first
watercourse there was a crash beneath my tender. One side of its
box-body tipped downward till the weight came on the tyre at the back
wheel, and we stuck.</p>
<p>The front bracket of the near back spring had crystallized through by
the chassis, in a sheer break which nothing but a workshop could mend.
We gazed in despair, for we were only three hundred yards from the
railway, and stood to lose the car, when the enemy came along in ten
minutes. A Rolls in the desert was above rubies: and though we had been
driving in these for eighteen months, not upon the polished roads of
their makers’ intention, but across country of the vilest, at speed, day
or night, carrying a ton of goods and four or five men up, yet this was
our first structural accident in the team of nine.</p>
<p>Rolls, the driver, our strongest and most resourceful man, the ready
mechanic, whose skill and advice largely kept our cars in running order,
was nearly in tears over the mishap. The knot of us, officers and men,
English, Arabs and Turks, crowded round him and watched his face
anxiously. As he realized that he, a private, commanded in this
emergency, even the stubble on his jaw seemed to harden in sullen
determination. At last he said there was just one chance. We might jack
up the fallen end of the spring, and wedge it, by baulks upon the
running board, in nearly its old position. With the help of ropes the
thin angle-irons of the running boards might carry the additional
weight.</p>
<p>We had on each car a length of scantling to place between the double
tyres if ever the car stuck in sand or mud. Three blocks of this would
make the needful height. We had no saw, but drove bullets through it
cross-wise till we could snap it off. The Turks heard us firing, and
halted cautiously. Joyce heard us and ran back to help. Into his car we
piled our load, jacked up the spring and the chassis, lashed in the
wooden baulks, let her down on them (they bore splendidly), cranked up,
and drove off. Rolls eased her to walking speed at every stone and
ditch, while we, prisoners and all, ran beside with cries of
encouragement, clearing the track.</p>
<p>In camp we stitched the blocks with captured telegraph wire, and
bound them together and to the chassis, and the spring to the chassis;
till it looked as strong as possible, and we put back the load. So
enduring was the running board that we did the ordinary work with the
car for the next three weeks, and took her so into Damascus at the end.
Great was Rolls, and great was Royce! They were worth hundreds of men to
us in these deserts.</p>
<p>This darning the car delayed us for hours, and at its end we slept in
Umtaiye, confident that, by starting before dawn, we should not be much
late in meeting Nuri Said on the Damascus line to-morrow: and we could
tell him that, for a week, the Amman line was sealed, by loss of a main
bridge. This was the side of quickest reinforcement for Deraa, and its
death made our rear safe. Even we had helped poor Zeid behind there in
Aba el Lissan: for the Turks massed in Tafileh would hold up that attack
till their communications were again open. Our last campaign was
beginning auspiciously.</p>
