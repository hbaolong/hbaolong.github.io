<h4 id="chapter-cxi">CHAPTER CXI</h4>
<p>SLOW work; and when at last we were ready a new visitor appeared, the
boy-chief of Tell el Shehab. His village was the key to the bridge. He
described the position; the large guard; how it was placed. Obviously
the problem was harder than we had believed, if hi-tale was true. We
doubted it, for his just-dead father had been hostile, and the son
sounded too suddenly devoted to our cause. However, he finished by
suggesting that he return after an hour with the officer commanding the
garrison, a friend of his. We sent him off to bring his Turk, telling
our waiting men to lie down for another brief test.</p>
<p>Soon the boy was back with a captain, an Armenian, anxious to harm
his government in any way he could. Also he was very nervous. We had
hard work to assure him of our enlightenment. His subalterns, he said,
were loyal Turks, and some of the non-commissioned officers. He proposed
we move close to the village, and lie there secretly, while three or
four of our lustiest men hid in his room. He would call his subordinates
one by one to see him; and, as each entered, our ambush might pinion
him.</p>
<p>This sounded in the proper descent from books of adventure, and we
agreed enthusiastically. It was nine at night. At eleven precisely we
would line up round the village and wait for the Sheikh to show our
strong men to the Commandant’s house. The two conspirators departed,
content, while we woke up our army, asleep with the sleep of exhaustion
beside their loaded camels. It was pitchy dark.</p>
<p>My bodyguard prepared bridge-cutting charges of gelatine. I filled my
pockets with detonators. Nasir sent men to each section of the Camel
Corps to tell them of the coming adventure, that they might work
themselves up to the height of it: and to ensure their mounting quietly,
without the disaster of a roaring camel. They played up. In a long
double line our force crept down a winding path, beside an irrigation
ditch, on the crest of the dividing ridge. If there was treachery before
us, this bare road would be a death-trap, without issue to right or
left, narrow, tortuous, and slippery with the ditchwater. So Nasir and I
went first with our men, their trained ears attentive to every sound,
their eyes keeping constant guard. In front of us was the waterfall,
whose burdening roar had given its character to that unforgettable night
with Ali ibn el Hussein when we had attempted this bridge from the other
wall of the ravine. Only to-night we were nearer, so that the noise
flooded up oppressively and filled our ears.</p>
<p>We crept very slowly and carefully now, soundless on our bare feet,
while behind us the heavier soldiery snaked along, holding their breath.
They also were soundless, for camels moved always stilly at night, and
we had packed the equipment not to tap, the saddles not to creak. Their
quietness made the dark darker, and deepened the menace of those
whispering valleys either side. Waves of dank air from the river met us,
chilly in our faces; and then Rahail came down swiftly from the left and
caught my arm, pointing to a slow column of white smoke rising from the
valley.</p>
<p>We ran to the edge of the descent, and peered over: but the depth was
grey with mist risen off the water, and we saw only dimness and this
pale vapour spiring from the level fog bank. Somewhere down there was
the railway, and we stopped the march, afraid lest this be the suspected
trap. Three of us went foot by foot down the slippery hill-side till we
could hear voices. Then suddenly the smoke broke and shifted, with the
panting of an opened throttle, and afterwards the squealing of brakes as
an engine came again to a standstill. There must be a long train waiting
beneath; reassured, we marched again to the very spur below the
village.</p>
<p>We extended in line across its neck, and waited five minutes, ten
minutes. They passed slowly. The murk night before moonrise was hushing
in its solidity, and would have compelled patience on our restless
fellows, without the added warnings of the dogs, and the intermittent
ringing challenge of sentries about the bridge. At length we let the men
slip quietly from their camels to the ground, and sat wondering at the
delay, and the Turks’ watchfulness, and the meaning of that silent train
standing below us in the valley. Our woollen cloaks got stiff and heavy
with the mist, and we shivered.</p>
<p>After a long while a lighter speck came through the dark. It was the
boy sheikh, holding his brown cloak open to show us his white shirt like
a flag. He whispered that his plan had failed. A train (this one in the
ravine), had just arrived with a German colonel and the German and Turk
reserves from Afuleh, sent up by Liman von Sandars, to rescue
panic-stricken Deraa.</p>
<p>They had put the little Armenian under arrest for being absent from
his post. There were machine-guns galore, and sentries patrolling the
approaches with ceaseless energy. In fact, there was a strong picket on
the path, not a hundred yards from where we sat: the oddity of our joint
state made me laugh, though quietly.</p>
<p>Nuri Said offered to take the place by main force. We had bombs
enough, and pistol flares; numbers and preparedness would be on our
side. It was a fair chance: but I was at the game of reckoning the value
of the objective in terms of life, and as usual finding it too dear. Of
course, most things done in war were too dear, and we should have
followed good example by going in and going through with it. But I was
secretly and disclaimedly proud of the planning of our campaigns: so I
told Nuri that I voted against it. We had to-day twice cut the
Damascus-Palestine railway; and the bringing here of the Afuleh garrison
was a third benefit to Allenby. Our bond had been most heavily
honoured.</p>
<p>Nuri, after a moment’s thought, agreed. We said good-night to the lad
who had honestly tried to do so much for us. We passed down the lines,
whispering to each man to lead back in silence. Then we sat in a group
with our rifles (mine Enver’s gold-inscribed Lee-Enfield trophy from the
Dardanelles, given by him to Feisal years ago) waiting till our men
should be beyond the danger zone.</p>
<p>Oddly enough this was the hardest moment of the night. Now the work
was over we could scarcely resist the temptation to rouse the
spoil-sport Germans out. It would have been so easy to have cracked off
a Very light into their bivouac; and the solemn men would have turned
out in ludicrous hurry, and shot hard into the bare, misty hill-side
silent at their feet. The identical notion came independently to Nasir,
Nuri Said, and myself. We blurted it out together, and each promptly
felt ashamed that the others had been as childish. By mutual cautions we
managed to keep our respectability. At Mezerib, after midnight, we felt
that something must be done to avenge the forfeited bridge. So two
parties of my fellows, with guides of Tallal’s men, went beyond Shehab,
and cut the line twice behind it on deserted gradients. Their echoing
explosions gave the German detachment a bad night. Flares were lit and
the neighbourhood searched for some brewing attack.</p>
<p>We were glad to give them as tiresome a night as ours, for then they
too would be languid in the morning. Our friends were still coming in
every minute, to kiss our hands and swear eternal fealty. Their wiry
ponies threaded our misted camp, between the hundreds of sleeping men,
and the uneasy camels, whose great jaws were munching all night at the
windy grass swallowed in the day hours.</p>
<p>Before dawn Pisani’s other guns and the rest of Nuri Said’s troops
arrived from Tell Arar. We had written to Joyce that on the morrow we
would return southward, by Nisib, to complete the circle of Deraa. I
suggested that he move straight back to Umtaiye and there wait for us:
for it, with its abundant water, splendid pasture, and equi-distance
from Deraa and Jebel Druse and the Rualla Desert, seemed an ideal place
in which we might rally and wait news of Allenby’s fortune. By holding
Umtaiye we as good as cut off the Turkish fourth army of beyond Jordan
(our special bird) from Damascus: and were in place quickly to renew our
main-line demolitions, whenever the enemy had nearly set them right.</p>
