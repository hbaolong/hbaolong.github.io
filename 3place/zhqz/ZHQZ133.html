<h4 id="chapter-cxxii">CHAPTER CXXII</h4>
<p>BY morning, after the sudden fashion of troubles, they were ended and
our ship sailing under a clear sky. The armoured cars came in, and the
pleasure of our men’s sedate faces heartened me. Pisani arrived, and
made me laugh, so bewildered was the good soldier by the political
hubbub. He gripped his military duty as a rudder to steer him through.
Damascus was normal, the shops open, street merchants trading, the
electric tramcars restored, grain and vegetables and fruits coming in
well.</p>
<p>The streets were being watered to lay the terrible dust of three
war-years’ lorry traffic. The crowds were slow and happy, and numbers of
British troops were wandering in the town, unarmed. The telegraph was
restored with Palestine, and with Beyrout, which the Arabs had occupied
in the night. As long ago as Wejh I had warned them, when they took
Damascus to leave Lebanon for sop to the French and take Tripoli
instead; since as a port it outweighed Beyrout, and England would have
played the honest broker for it on their behalf in the Peace Settlement.
So I was grieved by their mistake, yet glad they felt grown-up enough to
reject me.</p>
<p>Even the hospital was better. I had urged Chauvel to take it over,
but he would not. At the time I thought he meant to overstrain us, to
justify his taking away our government of the town. However, since, I
have come to feel that the trouble between us was a delusion of the
ragged nerves which were jangling me to distraction these days.
Certainly Chauvel won the last round, and made me feel mean, for when he
heard that I was leaving he drove round with Godwin and thanked me
outright for my help in his difficulties. Still, the hospital was
improving of itself. Fifty prisoners had cleaned the courtyard, burning
the lousy rubbish. A second gang had dug another great grave-pit in the
garden, and were zealously filling it as opportunity offered. Others had
gone through the wards, washing every patient, putting them into cleaner
shirts, and reversing their mattresses to have a tolerably decent side
up. We had found food suitable for all but critical cases, and each ward
had some Turkish-spoken orderly within hearing, if a sick man called.
One room we had cleared, brushed out and disinfected, meaning to
transfer into it the less ill cases, and do their room in turn.</p>
<p>At this rate three days would have seen things very fit, and I was
proudly contemplating other benefits when a medical major strode up and
asked me shortly if I spoke English. With a brow of disgust for my
skirts and sandals he said ‘You’re in charge?’ Modestly I smirked that
in a way I was, and then he burst out, ‘Scandalous, disgraceful,
outrageous, ought to be shot…’ At this onslaught I cackled out like a
chicken, with the wild laughter of strain; it did feel extraordinarily
funny to be so cursed just as I had been pluming myself on having
bettered the apparently hopeless.</p>
<p>The major had not entered the charnel house of yesterday, nor smelt
it, nor seen us burying those bodies of ultimate degradation, whose
memory had started me up in bed, sweating and trembling, a few hours
since. He glared at me, muttering ‘Bloody brute’. I hooted out again,
and he smacked me over the face and stalked off, leaving me more ashamed
than angry, for in my heart I felt he was right, and that anyone who
pushed through to success a rebellion of the weak against their masters
must come out of it so stained in estimation that afterward nothing in
the world would make him feel clean. However, it was nearly over.</p>
<p>When I got back to the hotel crowds were besetting it, and at the
door stood a grey Rolls-Royce, which I knew for Allenby’s. I ran in and
found him there with Clayton and Cornwallis and other noble people. In
ten words he gave his approval to my having impertinently imposed Arab
Governments, here and at Deraa, upon the chaos of victory. He confirmed
the appointment of Ali Riza Rikabi as his Military Governor, under the
orders of Feisal, his Army Commander, and regulated the Arab sphere and
Chauvel’s.</p>
<p>He agreed to take over my hospital and the working of the railway. In
ten minutes all the maddening difficulties had slipped away. Mistily I
realized that the harsh days of my solitary battling had passed. The
lone hand had won against the world’s odds, and I might let my limbs
relax in this dreamlike confidence and decision and kindness which were
Allenby.</p>
<p>Then we were told that Feisal’s special train had just arrived from
Deraa. A message was hurriedly sent him by Young’s mouth, and we waited
till he came, upon a tide of cheering which beat up against our windows.
It was fitting the two chiefs should meet for the first time in the
heart of their victory; with myself still acting as the interpreter
between them.</p>
<p>Allenby gave me a telegram from the Foreign Office, recognizing to
the Arabs the status of belligerents; and told me to translate it to the
Emir: but none of us knew what it meant in English, let alone in Arabic:
and Feisal, smiling through the tears which the welcome of his people
had forced from him, put it aside to thank the Commander-in-Chief for
the trust which had made him and his movement. They were a strange
contrast: Feisal, large-eyed, colourless and worn, like a fine dagger;
Allenby, gigantic and red and merry, fit representative of the Power
which had thrown a girdle of humour and strong dealing round the
world.</p>
<p>When Feisal had gone, I made to Allenby the last (and also I think
the first) request I ever made him for myself — leave to go away. For a
while he would not have it; but I reasoned, reminding him of his
year-old promise, and pointing out how much easier the New Law would be
if my spur were absent from the people. In the end he agreed; and then
at once I knew how much I was sorry.</p>
<p>DAMASCUS had not seemed a sheath for my sword, when I landed in
Arabia: but its capture disclosed the exhaustion of my main springs of
action. The strongest motive throughout had been a personal one, not
mentioned here, but present to me, I think, every hour of these two
years. Active pains and joys might fling up, like towers, among my days:
but, refluent as air, this hidden urge re-formed, to be the persisting
element of life, till near the end. It was dead, before we reached
Damascus.</p>
<p>Next in force had been a pugnacious wish to win the war: yoked to the
conviction that without Arab help England could not pay the price of
winning its Turkish sector. When Damascus fell, the Eastern war —
probably the whole war — drew to an end.</p>
<p>Then I was moved by curiosity. ‘Super flumina Babylonis’, read as a
boy, had left me longing to feel myself the node of a national movement.
We took Damascus, and I feared. More than three arbitrary days would
have quickened in me a root of authority.</p>
<p>There remained historical ambition, insubstantial as a motive by
itself. I had dreamed, at the City School in Oxford, of hustling into
form, while I lived, the new Asia which time was inexorably bringing
upon us. Mecca was to lead to Damascus; Damascus to Anatolia, and
afterwards to Bagdad; and then there was Yemen. Fantasies, these will
seem, to such as are able to call my beginning an ordinary effort.</p>
