<h4 id="chapter-xxviii">CHAPTER XXVIII</h4>
<p>IN Cairo the yet-hot authorities promised gold, rifles, mules, more
machine-guns, and mountain guns; but these last, of course, we never
got. The gun question was an eternal torment. Because of the hilly,
trackless country, field guns were no use to us; and the British Army
had no mountain guns except the Indian ten-pounder, which was
serviceable only against bows and arrows. Bremond had some excellent
Schneider sixty-fives at Suez, with Algerian gunners, but he regarded
them principally as his lever to move allied troops into Arabia. When we
asked him to send them down to us with or without men, he would reply,
first that the Arabs would not treat the crews properly, and then that
they would not treat the guns properly. His price was a British brigade
for Rabegh; and we would not pay it.</p>
<p>He feared to make the Arab Army formidable — an argument one could
understand — but the case of the British Government was
incomprehensible. It was not ill-will, for they gave us all else we
wanted; nor was it niggardliness, for their total help to the Arabs, in
materials and money, exceeded ten millions. I believed it was sheer
stupidity. But it was maddening to be unequal to many enterprises and to
fail in others, for the technical reason that we could not keep down the
Turkish artillery because its guns outranged ours by three or four
thousand yards. In the end, happily, Bremond over-reached himself, after
keeping his batteries idle for a year at Suez. Major Cousse, his
successor, ordered them down to us, and by their help we entered
Damascus. During that idle year they had been, to each Arab officer who
entered Suez, a silent incontrovertible proof of French malice towards
the Arab movement.</p>
<p>We received a great reinforcement to our cause in Jaafar Pasha, a
Bagdadi officer from the Turkish Army. After distinguished service in
the German and Turkish armies, he had been chosen by Enver to organize
the levies of the Sheikh el Senussi. He went there by submarine, made a
decent force of the wild men, and showed tactical ability against the
British in two battles. Then he was captured and lodged in the citadel
at Cairo with the other officer prisoners of war. He escaped one night,
slipping down a blanket-rope towards the moat; but the blankets failed
under the strain, and in the fall he hurt his ankle, and was re-taken
helpless. In hospital he gave his parole, and was enlarged after paying
for the torn blanket. But one day he read in an Arabic newspaper of the
Sherif’s revolt, and of the execution by the Turks of prominent Arab
Nationalists — his friends — and realized that he had been on the wrong
side.</p>
<p>Feisal had heard of him, of course, and wanted him as
commander-in-chief of his regular troops, whose improvement was now our
main effort. We knew that Jaafar was one of the few men with enough of
reputation and personality to weld their difficult and reciprocally
disagreeable elements into an army. King Hussein, however, would not
have it. He was old and narrow, and disliked Mesopotamians and Syrians:
Mecca must deliver Damascus. He refused the services of Jaafar. Feisal
had to accept him on his own responsibility.</p>
<p>In Cairo were Hogarth and George Lloyd, and Storrs and Deedes, and
many old friends. Beyond them the circle of Arabian well-wishers was now
strangely increased. In the army our shares rose as we showed profits.
Lynden Bell stood firmly our friend and swore that method was coming out
of the Arab madness. Sir Archibald Murray realized with a sudden shock
that more Turkish troops were fighting the Arabs than were fighting him,
and began to remember how he had always favoured the Arab revolt.
Admiral Wemyss was as ready to help now as he had been in our hard days
round Rabegh. Sir Reginald Wingate, High Commissioner in Egypt, was
happy in the success of the work he had advocated for years. I grudged
him this happiness; for McMahon who took the actual risk of starting it,
had been broken just before prosperity began. However, that was hardly
Wingate’s fault.</p>
<p>In the midst of my touching the slender stops of all these quills
there came a rude surprise. Colonel Bremond called to felicitate me on
the capture of Wejh, saying that it confirmed his belief in my military
talent and encouraged him to expect my help in an extension of our
success. He wanted to occupy Akaba with an Anglo-French force and naval
help. He pointed out the importance of Akaba, the only Turkish port left
in the Red Sea, the nearest to the Suez Canal, the nearest to the Hejaz
Railway, on the left flank of the Beersheba army; suggesting its
occupation by a composite brigade, which should advance up Wadi Itm for
a crushing blow at Maan. He began to enlarge on the nature of the
ground.</p>
<p>I told him that I knew Akaba from before the war, and felt that his
scheme was technically impossible. We could take the beach of the gulf;
but our forces there, as unfavourably placed as on a Gallipoli beach,
would be under observation and gun-fire from the coastal hills: and
these granite hills, thousands of feet high, were impracticable for
heavy troops: the passes through them being formidable defiles, very
costly to assault or to cover. In my opinion, Akaba, whose importance
was all and more than he said, would be best taken by Arab irregulars
descending from the interior without naval help.</p>
<p>Bremond did not tell me (but I knew) that he wanted the landing at
Akaba to head off the Arab movement, by getting a mixed force in front
of them (as at Rabegh), so that they might be confined to Arabia, and
compelled to waste their efforts against Medina. The Arabs still feared
that the Sherif’s alliance with us was based on a secret agreement to
sell them at the end, and such a Christian invasion would have confirmed
these fears and destroyed their co-operation. For my part, I did not
tell Bremond (but he knew) that I meant to defeat his efforts and to
take the Arabs soon into Damascus. It amused me, this
childishly-conceived rivalry of vital aims, but he ended his talk
ominously by saying that, anyhow, he was going down to put the scheme to
Feisal in Wejh.</p>
<p>Now, I had not warned Feisal that Bremond was a politician. Newcombe
was in Wejh, with his friendly desire to get moves on. We had not talked
over the problem of Akaba. Feisal knew neither its terrain nor its
tribes. Keenness and ignorance would lend an ear favourable to the
proposal. It seemed best for me to hurry down there and put my side on
its guard, so I left the same afternoon for Suez and sailed that night.
Two days later, in Wejh, I explained myself; so that when Bremond came
after ten days and opened his heart, or part of it, to Feisal, his
tactics were returned to him with improvements.</p>
<p>The Frenchman began by presenting six Hotchkiss automatics complete
with instructors. This was a noble gift; but Feisal took the opportunity
to ask him to increase his bounty by a battery of the quick-firing
mountain guns at Suez, explaining that he had been sorry to leave the
Yenbo area for Wejh, since Wejh was so much further from his objective —
Medina — but it was really impossible for him to assault the Turks (who
had French artillery) with rifles or with the old guns supplied him by
the British Army. His men had not the technical excellence to make a bad
tool prevail over a good one. He had to exploit his only advantages —
numbers and mobility — and, unless his equipment could be improved,
there was no saying where this protraction of his front might end!</p>
<p>Bremond tried to turn it off by belittling guns as useless for Hejaz
warfare (quite right, this, practically). But it would end the war at
once if Feisal made his men climb about the country like goats and tear
up the railway. Feisal, angry at the metaphor (impolite in Arabic),
looked at Bremond’s six feet of comfortable body, and asked if he had
ever tried to ‘goat’ himself. Bremond referred gallantly to the question
of Akaba, and the real danger to the Arabs in the Turks remaining there:
insisting that the British, who had the means for an expedition thither,
should be pressed to undertake it. Feisal, in reply, gave him a
geographical sketch of the land behind Akaba (I recognized the less
dashing part of it myself) and explained the tribal difficulties and the
food problem — all the points which made it a serious obstacle. He ended
by saying that, after the cloud of orders, counter-orders and confusion
over the allied troops for Rabegh, he really had not the face to
approach Sir Archibald Murray so soon with another request for an
excursion.</p>
<p>Bremond had to retire from the battle in good order, getting in a
Parthian shot at me, where I sat spitefully smiling, by begging Feisal
to insist that the British armoured cars in Suez be sent down to Wejh.
But even this was a boomerang, since they had started! After he had
gone, I returned to Cairo for a cheerful week, in which I gave my
betters much good advice. Murray, who had growlingly earmarked
Tullibardine’s brigade for Akaba, approved me still further when I
declared against that side-show too. Then to Wejh.</p>
