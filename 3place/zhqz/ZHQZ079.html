<h4 id="chapter-lxviii">CHAPTER LXVIII</h4>
<p>DAYS passed, talking politics, organization and strategy with Feisal,
while preparations for a new operation went forward. Our luck had
quickened the camp; and the mining of trains promised to become popular,
if we were able to train in the technique of the work enough men for
several parties. Captain Pisani was first volunteer. He was the
experienced commander of the French at Akaba, an active soldier who
burned for distinction — and distinctions. Feisal found me three young
Damascenes of family, who were ambitious to lead tribal raids. We went
to Rumm and announced that this raid was specially for Gasim’s clan.
Such coals of fire scorched them; but greed would not let them refuse.
Everyone for days around flocked to join. Most were denied:
nevertheless, we started out with one hundred and fifty men and a huge
train of empty pack-camels for the spoils.</p>
<p>For variety we determined to work by Maan. So we rode up to Batra,
climbing out of heat into cold, out of Arabia into Syria, from tamarisk
to wormwood. As we topped the pass and saw the blood-red stain on the
hills above the leech-infested wells, there met us a first breath of the
northern desert; that air too fine to describe, which told of perfect
loneliness, dried grass, and the sun on burning flints.</p>
<p>The guides said that Kilometre 475 would be good for mining: but we
found it beset by blockhouses, and had to creep shyly away. We marched
down the line till it crossed a valley on a high bank, pierced by
bridges on each side and in the middle. There, after midnight, we laid
an automatic mine of a new and very powerful lyddite type. The burying
took hours, and dawn caught us as we worked. There was no perceptible
lightening, and when we stared round to know where the dark was
yielding, we could see no special onset of the day. Long minutes
afterwards the sun disclosed itself, high above the earth’s rim, over a
vignetted bank of edgeless mist.</p>
<p>We retired a thousand yards up the valley’s scrubby bed to ambush for
the intolerable day. As the hours passed the sun increased, and shone so
closely upon our radiant trench that we felt crowded by its rays. The
men were a mad lot, sharpened to distraction by hope of success. They
would listen to no word but mine, and brought me their troubles for
judgement. In the six days’ raid there came to a head, and were settled,
twelve cases of assault with weapons, four camel-liftings, one marriage,
two thefts, a divorce, fourteen feuds, two evil eyes, and a
bewitchment.</p>
<p>These decisions were arrived at despite my imperfect knowledge of
Arabic. The fraudulence of my business stung me. Here were more fruits,
bitter fruits, of my decision, in front of Akaba, to become a principal
of the Revolt. I was raising the Arabs on false pretences, and
exercising a false authority over my dupes, on little more evidence than
their faces, as visible to my eyes weakly watering and stinging after a
year’s exposure to the throb, throb of sunlight.</p>
<p>We waited that day, and night. At sunset a scorpion scuttled out of
the bush by which I had lain down to make note of the day’s weariness,
and fastening on my left hand struck me, it seemed repeatedly. The pain
of my swollen arm kept me awake until the second dawn: to the relief of
my overburdened mind, for its body became clamant enough to interrupt my
self-questioning when the fire of some such surface injury swept the
sluggish nerves.</p>
<p>Yet pain of this quality never endured long enough really to cure
mind-sickness. After a night it would give way to that unattractive, and
not honourable, internal ache which in itself provoked thought and left
its victim yet weaker to endure. In such conditions the war seemed as
great a folly as my sham leadership a crime; and, sending for our
sheikhs, I was about to resign myself and my pretensions into their
puzzled hands, when the fugleman announced a train.</p>
<p>It came down from Maan, a water-train, and passed over the mine
without accident. The Arabs thanked me, for a booty of water was not
their dream. The mine-action had failed; so at noon, with my pupils, I
went down to lay an electric mine over the lyddite, that the detonation
of one might fire the other. For concealment we trusted to the mirage
and midday drowsiness of the Turks; justifiably, for there was no alarm
in the hour we spent burying the charge.</p>
<p>From the southern bridge we brought the electric leads to the middle
bridge, whose arch would conceal the exploder from a train overhead. The
Lewis guns we put under the northern bridge, to rake the far side of the
train when the mine went off. The Arabs would line the bushes of a
cross-channel of the valley three hundred yards our side of the railway.
We waited afterwards throughout a day of sunlight and flies. Enemy
patrols marched actively along the line, morning, afternoon and
evening.</p>
<p>On the second day, about eight in the morning, a pillar of smoke left
Maan. At the same time the first patrol approached. They were only half
a dozen men, but their warning would deter the train; and we watched
strainingly, in wonder which would win the race. The train was very
slow, and sometimes the patrol halted.</p>
<p>We calculated they might be two or three hundred yards short of us
when the train came. So we ordered everybody to stations. With twelve
loaded wagons the engine panted on the up grade. However, it held on
steadily. I sat by a bush in the stream-bed, a hundred yards from the
mine; in view of it and of the exploder-party and of the machine-guns.
When Faiz and Bedri heard the engine over their arch, they danced a
war-dance round their little electric box. The Arabs in the ditch were
hissing softly to me that it was time to fire: but not until the engine
was exactly over the arch did I jump up and wave my cloak. Faiz
instantly pressed his handle, and the great noise and dust and blackness
burst up, as at Mudowwara a week before, and enveloped me where I sat,
while the green-yellow sickly smoke of lyddite hung sluggishly about the
wreck. The Lewis guns rattled out suddenly, three or four short bursts:
there was a yell from the Arabs, and, headed by Pisani sounding the
women’s vibrant battle-cry, they rushed in a wild torrent for the
train.</p>
<p>A Turk appeared on the buffers of the fourth truck from the end,
loosed the couplings, and let the tail of the train slip back down the
gradient. I made a languid effort to get behind the wheel with a stone,
but scarcely cared enough to do it well. It seemed fair and witty that
this much of the booty should escape. A Turkish colonel from the window
fired at me with a Mauser pistol, cutting the flesh of my hip. I laughed
at his too-great energy, which thought, like a regular officer, to
promote the war by the killing of an individual.</p>
<p>Our mine had taken out the near arch of the bridge. Of the
locomotive, the fire-box was torn open, and many tubes burst. The cab
was cleared out, a cylinder gone, the frame buckled, two driving wheels
and their journals shattered. The tender and first waggon had
telescoped. About twenty Turks were dead, and others prisoners,
including four officers, who stood by the line weeping for the life
which the Arabs had no mind to take.</p>
<p>The contents of the trucks were food-stuffs, some seventy tons of
them; ‘urgently needed’, according to the way-bill, in Medain Salih. We
sent one way-bill to Feisal, as detailed report of our success, and left
the other receipted in the van. We also kicked northward some dozen
civilians, who had thought they were going to Medina.</p>
<p>Pisani superintended the carrying off or destruction of the booty. As
before, the Arabs were now merely camel-drivers, walking behind laden
pack-animals. Farraj held my camel, while Salem and Dheilan helped with
the exploder and the too-heavy wire. Rescue parties of Turks were four
hundred yards away when we had finished, but we rode off without a man
killed or wounded.</p>
<p>My pupils practised the art of mining afterwards by themselves, and
taught others. Rumours of their fortune rolled about the tribes in a
growing wave: not always intelligently. ‘Send us a lurens and we will
blow up trains with it’, wrote the Beni Atiyeh to Feisal. He lent them
Saad, a cut-and-thrust Ageyli, by whose help they got an important train
carrying Suleiman Rifada, our old nuisance of Wejh, with twenty thousand
pounds in gold, and precious trophies. Saad repeated history by saving
only the wire for his share.</p>
<p>In the next four months our experts from Akaba destroyed seventeen
locomotives. Travelling became an uncertain terror for the enemy. At
Damascus people scrambled for the back seats in trains, even paid extra
for them. The engine-drivers struck. Civilian traffic nearly ceased; and
we extended our threat to Aleppo by the mere posting a notice one night
on Damascus Town Hall, that good Arabs would henceforward travel by the
Syrian railway at their own risk. The loss of the engines was sore upon
the Turks. Since the rolling stock was pooled for Palestine and Hejaz,
our destructions not merely made the mass evacuation of Medina
impossible, but began to pinch the army about Jerusalem, just as the
British threat grew formidable.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Egypt had wired for me. An aeroplane carried me to G.H.Q.,
where Allenby by splendour of will was re-creating the broken British
Army. He asked what our railway efforts meant; or rather if they meant
anything beyond the melodramatic advertisement they gave Feisal’s
cause.</p>
<p>I explained my hope to leave the line just working, but only just, to
Medina; where Fakhri’s corps fed itself at less cost than if in prison
at Cairo. The surest way to limit the line without killing it was by
attacking trains. The Arabs put into mining a zest absent from their
pure demolitions. We could not yet break the line, since railhead was
the strongest point of a railway, and we preferred weakness in the
nearest enemy neighbour till our regular army was trained and equipped
and numerous enough to invest Maan.</p>
<p>He asked about Wadi Musa, because Turkish messages showed their
intention to assault it at once. I explained that we had tried to
provoke the Turks to attack Wadi Musa, and were about to be rewarded by
their falling, foxed and fogged, into our trap. We went about in
parties, not in stiff formation, and their aeroplanes failed to estimate
us. No spies could count us, either, since even ourselves had not the
smallest idea of our strength at any given moment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we knew them exactly; each single unit, and every
man they moved. They treated us as regulars, and before venturing a move
against us calculated the total force we could meet them with. We, less
orthodox, knew exactly what they would meet us with. This was our
balance. For these years the Arab Movement lived on the exhilarating but
slippery tableland between ‘could’ and ‘would’. We allowed no margin for
accident: indeed ‘no margins’ was the Akaba motto, continuously in the
mouths of all.</p>
<p>When at last it came, Jemal’s great attack on Wadi Musa made no
noise. Maulud presided beautifully. He opened his centre, and with the
greatest of humour let in the Turks until they broke their faces against
the vertical cliffs of the Arab refuge. Then, while they were still
puzzled and hurt, he came down simultaneously on both flanks. They never
again attacked a prepared Arab position. Their losses had been heavy,
but the loss of nerve at finding us invisible and yet full of back-lash
cost them more than the casualties. Thanks to Maulud, Akaba became quit
of all concern for its own present safety.</p>
<p>BOOK VI</p>
<p>THE RAID UPON THE BRIDGES</p>
<p>Chapters LXIX to LXXXI</p>
<p>BY November, 1917, Allenby was ready to open a general attack against
the Turks along his whole front. The Arabs should have done the same in
their sector: but I was afraid to put everything on a throw, and
designed instead the specious operation of cutting the Yarmuk Valley
Railway, to throw into disorder the expected Turkish retreat. This
half-measure met with the failure it deserved.</p>
