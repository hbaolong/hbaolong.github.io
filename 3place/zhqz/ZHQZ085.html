<h4 id="chapter-lxxiv">CHAPTER LXXIV</h4>
<p>DARK had fallen long before our caravan left Bair, after watering. We
chiefs waited longer still while the Zebn got ready. Mifleh’s
preparations included a visit to Essad, the supposed ancestor of the
clan, in his bedecked tomb near Annad’s grave. The Beni Sakhr were
already settled enough to have dressed themselves in the Semitic
village-superstitions of sacred places, holy trees, and funerary
shrines. Sheikh Mifleh thought the occasion warranted his adding another
head-cord to the ragged collection looped round Essad’s headstone, and
characteristically asked us to provide the offering. I handed over one
of my rich red-and-silk-silver Mecca ornaments, remarking that the
virtue lay with the donor. The thrifty Mifleh pressed upon me one
halfpenny in exchange, that he might plead purchase; and when I came
past a few weeks later and saw that the gaud was gone, he cursed loudly
in my hearing the sacrilege of some godless Sherari, who had robbed his
ancestor. Turki would have told me more.</p>
<p>A steep old pathway took us out of Wadi Bair. Near the crest of a
ridge we found the others camped for the night round a fire, but there
passed no talk or coffee-making for this time. We lay close together,
hushed and straining the ears to catch the throbbing of Allenby’s guns.
They spoke eloquently: and sheet lightning in the west made gun-flashes
for them.</p>
<p>Next day we passed to the left of the Thlaithukhwat, the ‘Three
Sisters’ whose clean white peaks were landmarks on their lofty watershed
for a day’s journey all about; and went down the soft rolling slopes
beyond them. The exquisite November morning had a softness in it like an
English summer; but its beauty had to be fought off. I was spending the
halts, and riding the stages, in the ranks of the Beni Sakhr teaching my
ear their dialect, and storing in my memory the tribal, family or
personal notes they let drop.</p>
<p>In the little-peopled desert every worshipful man knew every other;
and instead of books they studied their generation. To have fallen short
in such knowledge would have meant being branded either as ill-bred, or
as a stranger; and strangers were not admitted to familiar intercourse
or councils, or confidences. There was nothing so wearing, yet nothing
so important for the success of my purpose, as this constant mental
gymnastic of apparent omniscience at each time of meeting a new
tribe.</p>
<p>At nightfall we camped in an affluent of Wadi Jesha, by some bushes
of faint grey-green foliage, which pleased our camels and gave us
fire-wood. That night the guns were very clear and loud, perhaps because
the intervening hollow of the Dead Sea drummed the echoes up and over
our high plateau. The Arabs whispered ‘They are nearer; the English are
advancing; God deliver the men under that rain’. They were thinking
compassionately of the passing Turks, so long their weak oppressors;
whom, for their weakness, though oppressors, they loved more than the
strong foreigner with his blind indiscriminate justice.</p>
<p>The Arab respected force a little: he respected craft more, and often
had it in enviable degree: but most of all he respected blunt sincerity
of utterance, nearly the sole weapon God had excluded from his armament.
The Turk was all things by turn, and so commended himself to the Arabs
for such while as he was not corporately feared. Much lay in this
distinction of the corporate and the personal. There were Englishmen
whom, individually, the Arabs preferred to any Turk, or foreigner; but,
on the strength of this, to have generalized and called the Arabs
pro-English, would have been a folly. Each stranger made his own poor
bed among them.</p>
<p>We were up early, meaning to push the long way to Ammari by sunset.
We crossed ridge after carpeted ridge of sun-burned flints, grown over
with a tiny saffron plant so bright and close that all the view was
gold. Safra el Jesha, the Sukhur called it. The valleys were only inches
deep, their beds grained like morocco leather, in an intricate curving
mesh, by innumerable rills of water after the last rain. The swell of
every curve was a grey breast of sand set hard with mud, sometimes
glistening with salt-crystals, and sometimes rough with the projecting
brush of half-buried twigs which had caused it. These tailings of
valleys running into Sirhan were always rich in grazing. When there was
water in their hollows the tribes collected, and peopled them with
tent-villages. The Beni Sakhr with us had so camped; and, as we crossed
the monotonous downs they pointed first to one indistinctive hollow with
hearth and straight gutter-trenches and then to another saying, ‘There
was my tent and there lay Hamdan el Saih. Look at the dry stones for my
bed-place, and for Tarfa’s next it. God have mercy upon her, she died
the year of samh, in the Snainirat, of a puff-adder.’</p>
<p>About noon a party of trotting camels appeared over the ridge, moving
fast, and openly towards us. Little Turki cantered out on his old
she-camel, with cocked carbine across his thighs, to find what they
meant. ‘Ha,’ cried Mifleh to me while they were still a mile off, ‘that
is Fahad, on his Shaara, in the front. These are our kinsmen’, and sure
enough they were. Fahad and Adhub, chief war-leaders of the Zebn, had
been camped west of the railway by Ziza, when a Gomani came in with news
of our march. They had saddled at once, and by hard riding caught us
only half-way on the road. Fahad, in courteous fashion, chided me gently
for presuming to ride their district on an adventure while his father’s
sons lay in their tent.</p>
<p>Fahad was a melancholy, soft-voiced, little-spoken man of perhaps
thirty, with a white face, trim beard and tragic eyes. His young brother
Adhub was taller and stronger, yet not above middle height. Unlike
Fahad, he was active, noisy, uncouth-looking; with a snub nose, hairless
boy’s face and gleaming green eyes flickering hungrily from object to
object. His commonness was pointed by his dishevelled hair and dirty
clothes. Fahad was neater, but still very plainly dressed, and the pair,
on their shaggy home-bred camels, looked as little like sheikhs of their
reputation as can be conceived. However, they were famous fighters.</p>
<p>At Ammari a high cold night wind was stirring the ashen dust of the
salt-ground about the wells into a haze, which gritted in our teeth like
the stale breath of an eruption; and we were ungrateful for the water.
It was on the surface, like so much of Sirhan, but most of the pools
were too bitter to drink. One notable one, however, called Bir el Emir
was thought very good by contrast. It lay in a little floor of bare
limestone among sand-hummocks.</p>
<p>The water (opaque and tasting of mixed brine and ammonia) was just
below the level of the rock-slab, in a stone bath with ragged undercut
lips. Its depth Daud proved, by hurling Farraj fully-dressed into it. He
sank out of view in its yellowness, and afterwards rose quietly to the
surface under the rock-edge where he could not be seen in the dusk. Daud
waited a strained minute; but when his victim did not appear tore off
his cloak and plunged after — to find him smiling under the overhanging
ledge. Pearl-diving in the gulf had made them like fishes in the
water.</p>
<p>They were dragged out, and then had a wild struggle in the sand
beside the water-hole. Each sustained hurt, and they returned to my fire
dripping wet, in rags, bleeding, with their hair and faces, legs, arms
and bodies covered with mud and thorns, more like the devils of a
whirlwind than their usual suave delicate presences. They said they had
been dancing, and had tripped over a bush; it would be like my
generosity to make them a gift of new clothes. I blasted their hopes,
and sent them off to repair damages.</p>
<p>My bodyguard, more especially the Ageyl in it, were by nature
foppish, and spent their wages on dress or ornaments, and much time in
braiding their plaits of shining hair. Butter gave it the polish; and to
keep down the vermin they frequently dragged the scalp with a
fine-toothed comb, and sprinkled it with camel-staling. A German doctor
at Beersheba, in their Turkish days (these were the men who one misty
dawn rushed our Yeomanry in Sinai and wiped out a post) had taught them
to be clean by prisoning the lousy ones in army latrines until they had
swallowed their lice.</p>
<p>The wind became faint at dawn, and we moved forward for Azrak, half a
march ahead. Hardly, however, were we clear of the drifts beside the
wells when there was an alarm. Mounted men had been seen in the
brushwood. This country was a tom-tiddler’s ground of raiding parties.
We drew together in the best place and halted. The Indian section chose
a tiny ridge hacked about with narrow ruts of water-channels. They
couched camels in the hollow behind, and had their guns mounted in due
order in a moment. Ali and Abd el Kader threw out their great crimson
banners in the intermittent breeze. Our skirmishers headed by Ahmed and
Awad, ran out to right and left, and long shots were exchanged. All of
it ended suddenly. The enemy broke cover and marched in line towards us,
waving their cloaks and sleeves in the air and chanting their war-march
of welcome. They were the fighting men of the Serhan tribe on their way
to swear allegiance to Feisal. When they heard our news they turned back
with us, rejoicing to be spared the road, for this tribe was not
ordinarily warlike or nomadic. They made some little pomp over our joint
entry to their tents at Ain el Beidha, a few miles east of Azrak, where
the whole tribe was gathered; and our reception was loud, because there
had been fear and lamentation among the women that morning when they saw
their men march away on the hazard of rebellion.</p>
<p>However, here they were returning the same day, with a Sherif of
their own, and Arab banners, and machine-guns, marching a ragged hundred
men abreast, and singing as merrily as when they started out. My eyes
were upon a notable red camel, perhaps a seven-year-old, under a Sirhani
in the second line. The tall beast would not be put upon, but with a
long, swinging pace, of which there was no equal in the crowd of us,
forged to the front, and kept there. Ahmed slipped off to get acquainted
with her owner.</p>
<p>In the camp the chief men distributed our party among their tents for
the privilege of entertainment. Ali, Abd el Kader, Wood and myself were
taken in by Mteir, the paramount sheikh of the tribe, an old, toothless,
friendly thing, whose loose jaw sagged in his supporting hand all the
while he talked. He gave us a fussy greeting and abundant hospitality of
seethed sheep and bread. Wood and Abd el Kader were, perhaps, a little
squeamish, for the Serahin seemed primitive in food-discipline, and at
the common bowl there was more splashing and spluttering than was proper
in the best tents. Afterwards, by constraint of Mteir’s urgency, we lay
on his rugs for the one night. Round our fresh bodies, for the change of
food, collected all such local ticks, fleas and lice as were sick of a
diet of unmitigated Serhan. Their delight made them so ravenous that
with the best will in the world I could not go on feasting them. Nor
apparently could Ali; for he, too, sat up and said that he felt wakeful.
So we roused Sheikh Mteir, and sent for Mifleh ibn Bani, a young, active
man, accustomed to command their battles. To them we explained Feisal’s
needs, and our plan to relieve him.</p>
<p>Gravely they heard us. The western bridge, they said, was quite
impossible. The Turks had just filled its country with hundreds of
military wood-cutters. No hostile party could slip through undetected.
They professed great suspicion of the Moorish villages, and of Abd el
Kader. Nothing would persuade them to visit the one under the guidance
of the other. For Tell el Shehab, the nearest bridge, they feared lest
the villagers, their inveterate enemies, attack them in the rear. Also
if it rained the camels would be unable to trot back across the muddy
plains by Remthe, and the whole party would be cut off and killed.</p>
<p>We were now in deep trouble. The Serahin were our last resource, and
if they refused to come with us we should be unable to carry out
Allenby’s project by the appointed time. Accordingly Ali collected about
our little fire more of the better men of the tribe, and fortified the
part of courage by bringing in Fahad, and Mifleh, and Adhub. Before them
we began to combat in words this crude prudence of the Serahin, which
seemed all the more shameful to us after our long sojourn in the
clarifying wilderness.</p>
<p>We put it to them, not abstractedly, but concretely, for their case,
how life in mass was sensual only, to be lived and loved in its
extremity. There could be no rest-houses for revolt, no dividend of joy
paid out. Its spirit was accretive, to endure as far as the senses would
endure, and to use each such advance as base for further adventure,
deeper privation, sharper pain. Sense could not reach back or forward. A
felt emotion was a conquered emotion, an experience gone dead, which we
buried by expressing it.</p>
<p>To be of the desert was, as they knew, a doom to wage unending battle
with an enemy who was not of the world, nor life, nor anything, but hope
itself; and failure seemed God’s freedom to mankind. We might only
exercise this our freedom by not doing what it lay within our power to
do, for then life would belong to us, and we should have mastered it by
holding it cheap. Death would seem best of all our works, the last free
loyalty within our grasp, our final leisure: and of these two poles,
death and life, or, less finally, leisure and subsistence, we should
shun subsistence (which was the stuff of life) in all save its faintest
degree, and cling close to leisure. Thereby we would serve to promote
the not-doing rather than the doing. Some men, there might be,
uncreative; whose leisure was barren; but the activity of these would
have been material only. To bring forth immaterial things, things
creative, partaking of spirit, not of flesh, we must be jealous of
spending time or trouble upon physical demands, since in most men the
soul grew aged long before the body. Mankind had been no gainer by its
drudges.</p>
<p>There could be no honour in a sure success, but much might be wrested
from a sure defeat. Omnipotence and the Infinite were our two worthiest
foemen, indeed the only ones for a full man to meet, they being monsters
of his own spirit’s making; and the stoutest enemies were always of the
household. In fighting Omnipotence, honour was proudly to throw away the
poor resources that we had, and dare Him empty-handed; to be beaten, not
merely by more mind, but by its advantage of better tools. To the
clear-sighted, failure was the only goal. We must believe, through and
through, that there was no victory, except to go down into death
fighting and crying for failure itself, calling in excess of despair to
Omnipotence to strike harder, that by His very striking He might temper
our tortured selves into the weapon of His own ruin.</p>
<p>This was a halting, half-coherent speech, struck out desperately,
moment by moment, in our extreme need, upon the anvil of those white
minds round the dying fire; and hardly its sense remained with me
afterwards; for once my picture-making memory forgot its trade and only
felt the slow humbling of the Serahin, the night-quiet in which their
worldliness faded, and at last their flashing eagerness to ride with us
whatever the bourne. Before daylight we called old Abd el Kader, and,
taking him aside among the sandy thickets, screamed into his dense ear
that the Serahin would start with us, under his auspices, for Wadi
Khalid, after sunrise. He grunted that it was well: and we said to one
another that never, if life and opportunity were prolonged for us, would
we take a deaf man for a conspirator again.</p>
