<h4 id="chapter-xcvii">CHAPTER XCVII</h4>
<p>I EXPLAINED to Feisal that Nasir’s cutting of the line would endure
another month; and, after the Turks had got rid of him, it would be yet
a third month before they attacked us in Aba el Lissan. By then our new
camels should be fit for use in an offensive of our own. I suggested
that we ask his father, King Hussein, to transfer to Akaba the regular
units at present with Ali and Abdulla. Their reinforcement would raise
us to ten thousand strong, in uniformed men.</p>
<p>We would divide them into three parts. The immobile would constitute
a retaining force to hold Maan quiet. A thousand, on our new camels,
would attack the Deraa-Damascus sector. The balance would form a second
expedition, of two or three thousand infantry, to move into the Beni
Sakhr country and connect with Allenby at Jericho. The long-distance
mounted raid, by taking Deraa or Damascus would compel the Turks to
withdraw from Palestine one division, or even two, to restore their
communications. By so weakening the enemy, we would give Allenby the
power to advance his line, at any rate to Nablus. The fall of Nablus
would cut the lateral communication which made the Turks strong in Moab;
and they would be compelled to fall back on Amman, yielding us quiet
possession of the Jordan bottom. Practically I was proposing that we use
up the Hauran Arabs to let us reach Jericho, half-way to our Damascus
goal. Feisal fell in with the proposal, and gave me letters to his
father advising it. Unhappily the old man was, nowadays, little inclined
to take his advice, out of green-eyed hatred for his son who was doing
too well and was being disproportionately helped by the British. For
dealing with the King I relied on joint-action by Wingate and Allenby,
his paymasters. I decided to go up to Egypt personally, to press them to
write him letters of the necessary stiffness. In Cairo, Dawnay agreed
both to the transfer of the southern regulars, and to the independent
offensive. We went to Wingate, argued it, and convinced him that the
ideas were good. He wrote letters to King Hussein strongly advising the
reinforcement of Feisal. I pressed him to make clear to the King that
the continuance of a war-subsidy would depend on his giving effect to
our advice: but he refused to be stringent, and couched the letter in
terms of politeness, which would be lost on the hard and suspicious old
man in Mecca.</p>
<p>Yet the effort promised so much for us that we went up to Allenby, to
beg his help with the King. At G.H.Q., we felt a remarkable difference
in the air. The place was, as always, throbbing with energy and hope,
but now logic and co-ordination were manifest in an uncommon degree.
Allenby had a curious blindness of judgement in choosing men, due
largely to his positive greatness, which made good qualities in his
subordinates seem superfluous; but Chetwode, not content, had interposed
again, setting up Bartholomew, his own Chief of Staff, in the third
place of the hierarchy. Bartholomew, not made, like Dawnay, with many
foreign sides to his imagination, was yet more intricate, yet more
polished as a soldier, more careful and conscientious, and seemed a
friendly team-leader.</p>
<p>We unrolled before him our scheme to start the ball rolling in the
autumn, hoping by our pushes to make it possible for him to come in
later vigorously to our support. He listened smiling, and said that we
were three days too late. Their new army was arriving to time from
Mesopotamia and India; prodigious advances in grouping and training were
being made. On June the fifteenth it had been the considered opinion of
a private conference that the army would be capable of a general and
sustained offensive in September.</p>
<p>The sky was, indeed, opening over us; and we went in to Allenby, who
said outright that late in September he would make a grand attack to
fulfil the Smuts’ plan even to Damascus and Aleppo. Our role would be as
laid down in the spring; we must make the Deraa raid on the two thousand
new camels. Times and details would be fixed as the weeks went on, and
as Bartholomew’s calculations took shape.</p>
<p>Our hope of victory had been too often dashed for me to take this as
assured. So, for second string, I got Allenby’s blessing upon the
transfer of Ali’s and Abdulla’s khaki-clad contingents; and set off,
fortified, to Jeddah, where I had no more success than I expected. The
King had got wind of my purpose and took refuge, on the pretext of
Ramadhan, in Mecca, his inaccessible capital. We talked over the
telephone, King Hussein sheltering himself behind the incompetence of
the operators in the Mecca exchange, whenever the subject turned
dangerous. My thronged mind was not in the mood for farce, so I rang
off, put Feisal’s, Wingate’s and Allenby’s letters back unopened into my
bag and returned to Cairo in the next ship.</p>
<p>BOOK I</p>
<p>XBALANCING FOR A LAST EFFORT</p>
<p>Chapters XCVIII to CVI</p>
<p>ALLENBY, in rapid embodiment of reliefs from India and Mesopotamia,
so surpassed hope that he was able to plan an Autumn offensive. The near
balance of the forces on each side meant that victory would depend on
his subtly deceiving the Turks that their entire danger yet lay beyond
the Jordan.</p>
<p>We might help, by lying quiet for six weeks, feigning a feebleness
which should tempt the Turks to attack.</p>
<p>The Arabs were then to lead off at the critical moment by cutting the
railway communications of Palestine.</p>
<p>Such bluff within bluff called for most accurate timing, since the
balance would have been wrecked either by a premature Turkish retreat in
Palestine, or by their premature attack against the Arabs beyond Jordan.
We borrowed from Allenby some Imperial Camel Corps to lend extra colour
to our supposed critical situation; while preparations for Deraa went on
with no more check than an untimely show of pique from King Hussein.</p>
