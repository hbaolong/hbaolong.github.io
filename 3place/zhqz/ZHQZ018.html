<h4 id="chapter-vii">CHAPTER VII</h4>
<p>OUR check in Mesopotamia was a disappointment to us; but McMahon
continued his negotiations with Mecca, and finally brought them to
success despite the evacuation of Gallipoli, the surrender of Kut, and
the generally unfortunate aspect of the war at the moment. Few people,
even of those who knew all the negotiations, had really believed that
the Sherif would fight; consequently his eventual rebellion and opening
of his coast to our ships and help took us and them by surprise.</p>
<p>We found our difficulties then only beginning. The credit of the new
factor was to McMahon and Clayton: professional jealousies immediately
raised their heads. Sir Archibald Murray, the General in Egypt, wanted,
naturally enough, no competitors, and no competing campaigns in his
sphere. He disliked the civil power, which had so long kept the peace
between himself and General Maxwell. He could not be entrusted with the
Arabian affair; for neither he nor his staff had the ethnological
competence needed to deal with so curious a problem. On the other hand,
he could make the spectacle of the High Commission running a private war
sufficiently ridiculous. His was a very nervous mind, fanciful and
essentially competitive. When confronted with what he considered a rival
show, he bent his very considerable powers to crab it.</p>
<p>He found help in his Chief of Staff, General Lynden Bell, a red
soldier, with an instinctive shuddering away from politicians, and a
conscientiously assumed heartiness. His military conception of the
loyalties of his office involved him in a chameleon-like attempt to
imitate the frailties as well as the virtues of his chief.</p>
<p>Two of the General Staff officers followed their leaders full cry;
and so the unfortunate McMahon found himself deprived of Army help and
reduced to waging his war in Arabia with the assistance of his Foreign
Office Attaches. Even these proved not all quite loyal to him.</p>
<p>Some appeared to resent a war which allowed outsiders to thrust into
their business. Also their training in suppression, by which alone the
daily trivialities of diplomacy were made to look like man’s work, had
so sunk into them that when the more important thing arrived, they made
it trivial. Their feebleness of tone, and niggling dishonesties to one
another, angered the military to disgust; and were bad for us, too,
since they patently let down the High Commissioner, whose boots the G ——
s were not good enough to clean.</p>
<p>Wingate, who had complete confidence in his own grasp of the
situation in the Middle East, foresaw credit and great profit for the
country in the Arab development; but as criticism slowly beat up against
McMahon he dissociated himself from him, and London began to hint that
better use might be made by an experienced hand of so subtle and
involved a skein.</p>
<p>However it was, things in the Hejaz went from bad to worse. No proper
liaison was provided for the Arab forces in the field, no military
information was given the Sherifs, no tactical advice or strategy was
suggested, no attempt made to find out the local conditions and adapt
existing Allied resources in material to suit their needs. The French
Military Mission (which Clayton’s prudence had suggested be sent to
Hejaz to soothe our very suspicious allies by taking them behind the
scenes and giving them a purpose there), was permitted to carry on an
elaborate intrigue against Sherif Hussein in his towns of Jidda and
Mecca, and to propose to him and to the British authorities measures
that must have ruined his cause in the eyes of all Moslems. Wingate now
in military control of our co-operation with the Sherif, was induced to
land some foreign troops at Rabegh, half-way between Medina and Mecca,
for the defence of Mecca and to hold up the further advance of the
reinvigorated Turks from Medina. McMahon, in the multitude of
counsellors, became confused, and gave a handle to Murray to cry out
against his inconsistencies. The Arab Revolt became discredited; and
Staff Officers in Egypt gleefully prophesied to us its near failure and
the stretching of Sherif Hussein’s neck on a Turkish scaffold.</p>
<p>My private position was not easy. As Staff Captain under Clayton in
Sir Archibald Murray’s Intelligence Section, I was charged with the
‘distribution’ of the Turkish Army and the preparation of maps. By
natural inclination I had added to them the invention of the Arab
Bulletin, a secret weekly record of Middle-Eastern politics; and of
necessity Clayton came more and more to need me in the military wing of
the Arab Bureau, the tiny intelligence and war staff for foreign
affairs, which he was now organizing for McMahon. Eventually Clayton was
driven out of the General Staff; and Colonel Holdich, Murray’s
intelligence officer at Ismailia, took his place in command of us. His
first intention was to retain my services; and since he clearly did not
need me, I interpreted this, not without some friendly evidence, as a
method of keeping me away from the Arab affair. I decided that I must
escape at once, if ever. A straight request was refused; so I took to
stratagems. I became, on the telephone (G.H.Q. were at Ismailia, and I
in Cairo) quite intolerable to the Staff on the Canal. I took every
opportunity to rub into them their comparative ignorance and
inefficiency in the department of intelligence (not difficult!) and
irritated them yet further by literary airs, correcting Shavian split
infinitives and tautologies in their reports.</p>
<p>In a few days they were bubbling over on my account, and at last
determined to endure me no longer. I took this strategic opportunity to
ask for ten days’ leave, saying that Storrs was going down to Jidda on
business with the Grand Sherif, and that I would like a holiday and
joyride in the Red Sea with him. They did not love Storrs, and were glad
to get rid of me for the moment. So they agreed at once, and began to
prepare against my return some official shelf for me. Needless to say, I
had no intention of giving them such a chance; for, while very ready to
hire my body out on petty service, I hesitated to throw my mind
frivolously away. So I went to Clayton and confessed my affairs; and he
arranged for the Residency to make telegraphic application to the
Foreign Office for my transfer to the Arab Bureau. The Foreign Office
would treat directly with the War Office; and the Egypt command would
not hear of it, till all was ended.</p>
<p>Storrs and I then marched off together, happily. In the East they
swore that by three sides was the decent way across a square; and my
trick to escape was in this sense oriental. But I justified myself by my
confidence in the final success of the Arab Revolt if properly advised.
I had been a mover in its beginning: my hopes lay in it. The fatalistic
subordination of a professional soldier (intrigue being unknown in the
British army) would have made a proper officer sit down and watch his
plan of campaign wrecked by men who thought nothing of it, and to whose
spirit it made no appeal. Non nobis, Domine.</p>
<p>BOOK I</p>
<p>THE DISCOVERY OF FEISAL</p>
<p>Chapters VIII to XVI</p>
<p>I HAD believed these misfortunes of the Revolt to be due mainly to
faulty leadership, or rather to the lack of leadership, Arab and
English. So I went down to Arabia to see and consider its great men. The
first, the Sherif of Mecca, we knew to be aged. I found Abdulla too
clever, Ali too clean, Zeid too cool.</p>
<p>Then I rode up-country to Feisal, and found in him the leader with
the necessary fire, and yet with reason to give effect to our science.
His tribesmen seemed sufficient instrument, and his hills to provide
natural advantage. So I returned pleased and confident to Egypt, and
told my chiefs how Mecca was defended not by the obstacle of Rabegh, but
by the flank-threat of Feisal in Jebel Subh.</p>
