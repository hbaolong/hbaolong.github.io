<h4 id="chapter-xiv">CHAPTER XIV</h4>
<p>SO mixed was the company, Sherifs, Meccans, sheikhs of the Juheina
and Ateiba, Mesopotamians, Ageyl, that I threw apples of discord,
inflammatory subjects of talk amongst them, to sound their mettle and
beliefs without delay. Feisal, smoking innumerable cigarettes, kept
command of the conversation even at its hottest, and it was fine to
watch him do it. He showed full mastery of tact, with a real power of
disposing men’s feelings to his wish. Storrs was as efficient; but
Storrs paraded his strength, exhibiting all the cleverness and
machinery, the movements of his hands which made the creatures dance.
Feisal seemed to govern his men unconsciously: hardly to know how he
stamped his mind on them, hardly to care whether they obeyed. It was as
great art as Storrs’; and it concealed itself, for Feisal was born to
it.</p>
<p>The Arabs loved him openly: indeed, these chance meetings made clear
how to the tribes the Sherif and his sons were heroic. Sherif Hussein
(Sayidna as they called him) was outwardly so clean and gentle-mannered
as to seem weak; but this appearance hid a crafty policy, deep ambition,
and an un-Arabian foresight, strength of character and obstinacy. His
interest in natural history reinforced his sporting instincts, and made
him (when he pleased) a fair copy of a Beduin prince, while his
Circassian mother had endowed him with qualities foreign to both Turk
and Arab, and he displayed considerable astuteness in turning now one,
now another of his inherited assets to present advantage.</p>
<p>Yet the school of Turkish politics was so ignoble that not even the
best could graduate from it unaffected. Hussein when young had been
honest, outspoken… and he learned not merely to suppress his speech, but
to use speech to conceal his honest purpose. The art, overindulged,
became a vice from which he could not free himself. In old age ambiguity
covered his every communication. Like a cloud it hid his decision of
character, his worldly wisdom, his cheerful strength. Many denied him
such qualities: but history gave proof.</p>
<p>One instance of his worldly wisdom was the upbringing of his sons.
The Sultan had made them live in Constantinople to receive a Turkish
education. Sherif Hussein saw to it that the education was general and
good. When they came back to the Hejaz as young effendis in European
clothes with Turkish manners, the father ordered them into Arab dress;
and, to rub up their Arabic, gave them Meccan companions and sent them
out into the wilds, with the Camel Corps, to patrol the pilgrim
roads.</p>
<p>The young men thought it might be an amusing trip, but were dashed
when their father forbade them special food, bedding, or soft-padded
saddles. He would not let them back to Mecca, but kept them out for
months in all seasons guarding the roads by day and by night, handling
every variety of man and learning fresh methods of riding and fighting.
Soon they hardened, and became self-reliant, with that blend of native
intelligence and vigour which so often comes in a crossed stock. Their
formidable family group was admired and efficient, but curiously
isolated in their world. They were natives of no country, lovers of no
private plot of ground. They had no real confidants or ministers; and no
one of them seemed open to another, or to the father, of whom they stood
in awe.</p>
<p>The debate after supper was an animated one. In my character as a
Syrian I made sympathetic reference to the Arab leaders who had been
executed in Damascus by Jemal Pasha. They took me up sharply: the
published papers had disclosed that these men were in touch with foreign
Governments, and ready to accept French or British suzerainty as the
price of help. This was a crime against Arab nationality, and Jemal had
only executed the implied sentence. Feisal smiled, almost winked, at me.
‘You see,’ he explained, ‘we are now of necessity tied to the British.
We are delighted to be their friends, grateful for their help, expectant
of our future profit. But we are not British subjects. We would be more
at ease if they were not such disproportionate allies.’</p>
<p>I told a story of Abdulla el Raashid, on the way up to Hamra. He had
groaned to me of the British sailors coming ashore each day at Rabegh.
‘Soon they will stay nights, and then they will live here always, and
take the country.’ To cheer him I had spoken of millions of Englishmen
now ashore in France, and of the French not afraid. Whereat he had
turned on me scornfully, asking if I meant to compare France with the
land of Hejaz!</p>
<p>Feisal mused a little and said, ‘I am not a Hejazi by upbringing; and
yet, by God, I am jealous for it. And though I know the British do not
want it, yet what can I say, when they took the Sudan, also not wanting
it? They hunger for desolate lands, to build them up; and so, perhaps,
one day Arabia will seem to them precious. Your good and my good,
perhaps they are different, and either forced good or forced evil will
make a people cry with pain. Does the ore admire the flame which
transforms it? There is no reason for offence, but a people too weak are
clamant over their little own. Our race will have a cripple’s temper
till it has found its feet.’</p>
<p>The ragged, lousy tribesmen who had eaten with us astonished me by
their familiar understanding of intense political nationality, an
abstract idea they could hardly have caught from the educated classes of
the Hejaz towns, from those Hindus, Javanese, Bokhariots, Sudanese,
Turks, out of sympathy with Arab ideals, and indeed just then suffering
a little from the force of local sentiment, springing too high after its
sudden escape from Turkish control. Sherif Hussein had had the worldly
wisdom to base his precepts on the instinctive belief of the Arabs that
they were of the salt of the earth and self-sufficient. Then, enabled by
his alliance with us to back his doctrine by arms and money, he was
assured of success.</p>
<p>Of course, this success was not level throughout. The great body of
Sherifs, eight hundred or nine hundred of them, understood his
nationalistic doctrine and were his missionaries, successful
missionaries thanks to the revered descent from the Prophet, which gave
them the power to hold men’s minds, and to direct their courses into the
willing quietness of eventual obedience.</p>
<p>The tribes had followed the smoke of their racial fanaticism. The
towns might sigh for the cloying inactivity of Ottoman rule: the tribes
were convinced that they had made a free and Arab Government, and that
each of them was It. They were independent and would enjoy themselves —
a conviction and resolution which might have led to anarchy, if they had
not made more stringent the family tie, and the bonds of
kin-responsibility. But this entailed a negation of central power. The
Sherif might have legal sovereignty abroad, if he liked the
high-sounding toy; but home affairs were to be customary. The problem of
the foreign theorists — ‘Is Damascus to rule the Hejaz, or can Hejaz
rule Damascus?’ did not trouble them at all, for they would not have it
set. The Semites’ idea of nationality was the independence of clans and
villages, and their ideal of national union was episodic combined
resistance to an intruder. Constructive policies, an organized state, an
extended empire, were not so much beyond their sight as hateful in it.
They were fighting to get rid of Empire, not to win it.</p>
<p>The feeling of the Syrians and Mesopotamians in these Arab armies was
indirect. They believed that by fighting in the local ranks, even here
in Hejaz, they were vindicating the general rights of all Arabs to
national existence; and without envisaging one State, or even a
confederation of States, they were definitely looking northward, wishing
to add an autonomous Damascus and Bagdad to the Arab family. They were
weak in material resources, and even after success would be, since their
world was agricultural and pastoral, without minerals, and could never
be strong in modern armaments. Were it otherwise, we should have had to
pause before evoking in the strategic centre of the Middle East new
national movements of such abounding vigour.</p>
<p>Of religious fanaticism there was little trace. The Sherif refused in
round terms to give a religious twist to his rebellion. His fighting
creed was nationality. The tribes knew that the Turks were Moslems, and
thought that the Germans were probably true friends of Islam. They knew
that the British were Christians, and that the British were their
allies. In the circumstances, their religion would not have been of much
help to them, and they had put it aside. ‘Christian fights Christian, so
why should not Mohammedans do the same? What we want is a Government
which speaks our own language of Arabic and will let us live in peace.
Also we hate those Turks.’</p>
