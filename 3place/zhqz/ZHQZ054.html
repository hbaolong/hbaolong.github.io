<h4 id="chapter-xliii">CHAPTER XLIII</h4>
<p>BEFORE dawn the following day we started down the bed of Seil Abu
Arad till the white sun came up over the Zibliyat hills ahead of us. We
turned more north to cut off an angle of the valley, and halted for half
an hour till we saw the main body coming. Then Auda, Nasir and myself,
unable longer to endure passively the hammer strokes of the sun upon our
bowed heads, pushed forward at a jerky trot. Almost at once we lost
sight of the others in the lymph-like heat-vapour throbbing across the
flat: but the road was evident, down the scrubby bed of Wadi Fejr.</p>
<p>At the height of noon we reached the well of our desire. It was about
thirty feet deep, stone-steyned, seemingly ancient. The water was
abundant, slightly brackish, but not ill-tasting when drunk fresh:
though it soon grew foul in a skin. The valley had flooded in some burst
of rain the year before, and therefore contained much dry and thirsty
pasturage: to this we loosed our camels. The rest came up, and drew
water and baked bread. We let the camels crop industriously till
nightfall, then watered them again, and pounded them under the bank a
half mile from the water, for the night: thus leaving the well
unmolested in case raiders should need it in the dark hours. Yet our
sentries heard no one.</p>
<p>As usual we were off before dawn, though we had an easy march before
us; but the heated glare of the desert became so painful that we
designed to pass the midday in some shelter. After two miles the valley
spread out, and later we came to a low, broken cliff on the east bank
opposite the mouth of Seil Raugha. Here the country looked more green,
and we asked Auda to fetch us game. He sent Zaal one way and rode
westward himself across the open plain which stretched beyond view,
while we turned in to the cliffs and found beneath their fallen crags
and undercut ledges abundant shady nooks, cool against the sun and
restful for our unaccustomed eyes.</p>
<p>The hunters returned before noon, each with a good gazelle. We had
filled our water-skins at Fejr, and could use them up, for the water of
Abu Ajaj was near: so there was feasting on bread and meat in our stone
dens. These indulgences, amid the slow fatigue of long unbroken marches,
were grateful to the delicate townsfolk among us: to myself, and to
Zeki, and Nesib’s Syrian servants, and in a lesser degree to Nesib
himself. Nasir’s courtesy as host, and his fount of native kindliness,
made him exquisite in attention to us whenever the road allowed. To his
patient teaching I owed most of my later competence to accompany tribal
Arabs on the march without ruining their range and speed.</p>
<p>We rested till two in the afternoon, and reached our stage, Khabr
Ajaj, just before sunset, after a dull ride over a duller plain which
prolonged Wadi Fejr to the eastward for many miles. The pool was of this
year’s rain, already turned thick; and brackish; but good for camels and
just possible for men to drink. It lay in a shallow double depression by
Wadi Fejr, whose flood had filled it two feet deep over an area two
hundred yards across. At its north end was a low sandstone tump. We had
thought to find Howeitat here; but the ground was grazed bare and the
water fouled by their animals, while they themselves were gone. Auda
searched for their tracks, but could find none: the wind-storms had
swept the sand-face into clean new ripples. However, since they had come
down here from Tubaik, they must have gone on and out into Sirhan: so,
if we went away northward, we should find them.</p>
<p>The following day, despite the interminable lapse of time, was only
our fourteenth from Wejh; and its sun rose upon us again marching. In
the afternoon we at last left Wadi Fejr to steer for Arfaja in Sirhan, a
point rather east of north. Accordingly, we inclined right, over flats
of limestone and sand, and saw a distant corner of the Great Nefudh, the
famous belts of sand-dune which cut off Jebel Shammar from the Syrian
Desert. Palgrave, the Blunts, and Gertrude Bell amongst the storied
travellers had crossed it, and I begged Auda to bear off a little and
let us enter it, and their company: but he growled that men went to the
Nefudh only of necessity, when raiding, and that the son of his father
did not raid on a tottering, mangy camel. Our business was to reach
Arfaja alive.</p>
<p>So we wisely marched on, over monotonous, glittering sand; and over
those worse stretches, ‘Giaan’, of polished mud, nearly as white and
smooth as laid paper, and often whole miles square. They blazed back the
sun into our faces with glassy vigour, so we rode with its light raining
direct arrows upon our heads, and its reflection glancing up from the
ground through our inadequate eyelids. It was not a steady pressure, but
a pain ebbing and flowing; at one time piling itself up and up till we
nearly swooned; and then falling away coolly, in a moment of false
shadow like a black web crossing the retina: these gave us a moment’s
breathing space to store new capacity for suffering, like the struggles
to the surface of a drowning man.</p>
<p>We grew short-answered to one another; but relief came toward six
o’clock, when we halted for supper, and baked ourselves fresh bread. I
gave my camel what was left of my share, for the poor animal went tired
and hungry in these bad marches. She was the pedigree camel given by Ibn
Saud of Nejd to King Hussein and by him to Feisal; a splendid beast;
rough, but sure-footed on hills, and great-hearted. Arabs of means rode
none but she-camels, since they went smoother under the saddle than
males, and were better tempered and less noisy: also, they were patient
and would endure to march long after they were worn out, indeed until
they tottered with exhaustion and fell in their tracks and died: whereas
the coarser males grew angry, flung themselves down when tired, and from
sheer rage would die there unnecessarily.</p>
<p>After dark we crawled for three hours, reaching the top of a
sand-ridge. There we slept thankfully, after a bad day of burning wind,
dust blizzards, and drifting sand which stung our inflamed faces, and at
times, in the greater gusts, wrapped the sight of our road from us and
drove our complaining camels up and down. But Auda was anxious about the
morrow, for another hot head-wind would delay us a third day in the
desert, and we had no water left: so he called us early in the night,
and we marched down into the plain of the Bisaita (so called in
derision, for its huge size and flatness), before day broke. Its fine
surface-litter of sun-browned flints was restfully dark after sunrise
for our streaming eyes, but hot and hard going for our camels, some of
which were already limping with sore feet.</p>
<p>Camels brought up on the sandy plains of the Arabian coast had
delicate pads to their feet; and if such animals were taken suddenly
inland for long marches over flints or other heat-retaining ground,
their soles would burn, and at last crack in a blister; leaving quick
flesh, two inches or more across, in the centre of the pad. In this
state they could march as ever over sand; but if, by chance, the foot
came down on a pebble, they would stumble, or flinch as though they had
stepped on fire, and in a long march might break down altogether unless
they were very brave. So we rode carefully, picking the softest way,
Auda and myself in front.</p>
<p>As we went, some little puffs of dust scurried into the eye of the
wind. Auda said they were ostriches. A man ran up to us with two great
ivory eggs. We settled to breakfast on this bounty of the Biseita, and
looked for fuel; but in twenty minutes found only a wisp of grass. The
barren desert was defeating us. The baggage train passed, and my eye
fell on the loads of blasting gelatine. We broached a packet, shredding
it carefully into a fire beneath the egg propped on stones, till the
cookery was pronounced complete. Nasir and Nesib, really interested,
dismounted to scoff at us. Auda drew his silver-hilted dagger and
chipped the top of the first egg. A stink like a pestilence went across
our party. We fled to a clean spot, rolling the second egg hot before us
with gentle kicks. It was fresh enough, and hard as a stone. We dug out
its contents with the dagger on to the flint flakes which were our
platters, and ate it piecemeal; persuading even Nasir, who in his life
before had never fallen so low as egg-meat, to take his share. The
general verdict was: tough and strong, but good in the Biseita.</p>
<p>Zaal saw an oryx; stalked it on foot, and killed it. The better
joints were tied upon the baggage camels for the next halt, and our
march continued. Afterwards the greedy Howeitat saw more oryx in the
distance and went after the beasts, who foolishly ran a little; then
stood still and stared till the men were near, and, too late, ran away
again. Their white shining bellies betrayed them; for, by the
magnification of the mirage, they winked each move to us from afar.</p>
