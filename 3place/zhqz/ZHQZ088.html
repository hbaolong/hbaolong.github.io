<h4 id="chapter-lxxvii">CHAPTER LXXVII</h4>
<p>FOOD was going to be our next preoccupation, and we held a council in
the cold driving rain to consider what we might do. For lightness’ sake
we had carried from Azrak three days’ rations, which made us complete
until to-night; but we could not go back empty-handed. The Beni Sakhr
wanted honour, and the Serahin were too lately disgraced not to clamour
for more adventure. We had still a reserve bag of thirty pounds of
gelatine, and Ali ibn el Hussein who had heard of the performances below
Maan, and was as Arab as any Arab, said, ‘Let’s blow up a train’. The
word was hailed with universal joy, and they looked at me: but I was not
able to share their hopes, all at once.</p>
<p>Blowing up trains was an exact science when done deliberately, by a
sufficient party, with machine-guns in position. If scrambled at it
might become dangerous. The difficulty this time was that the available
gunners were Indians; who, though good men fed, were only half-men in
cold and hunger. I did not propose to drag them off without rations on
an adventure which might take a week. There was no cruelty in starving
Arabs; they would not die of a few days’ fasting, and would fight as
well as ever on empty stomachs; while, if things got too difficult,
there were the riding-camels to kill and eat: but the Indians, though
Moslems, refused camel-flesh on principle.</p>
<p>I explained these delicacies of diet. Ali at once said that it would
be enough for me to blow up the train, leaving him and the Arabs with
him to do their best to carry its wreck without machine-gun support. As,
in this unsuspecting district, we might well happen on a supply train,
with civilians or only a small guard of reservists aboard, I agreed to
risk it. The decision having been applauded, we sat down in a cloaked
circle, to finish our remaining food in a very late and cold supper (the
rain had sodden the fuel and made fire not possible) our hearts somewhat
comforted by chance of another effort.</p>
<p>At dawn, with the unfit of the Arabs, the Indians moved away for
Azrak, miserably. They had started up country with me in hope of a
really military enterprise, and first had seen the muddled bridge, and
now were losing this prospective train. It was hard on them; and to
soften the blow with honour I asked Wood to accompany them. He agreed,
after argument, for their sakes; but it proved a wise move for himself,
as a sickness which had been troubling him began to show the early signs
of pneumonia.</p>
<p>The balance of us, some sixty men, turned back towards the railway.
None of them knew the country, so I led them to Minifir, where, with
Zaal, we had made havoc in the spring. The re-curved hill-top was an
excellent observation post, camp, grazing ground and way of retreat, and
we sat there in our old place till sunset, shivering and staring out
over the immense plain which stretched map-like to the clouded peaks of
Jebel Druse, with Umel Jemal and her sister-villages like ink-smudges on
it through the rain.</p>
<p>In the first dusk we walked down to lay the mine. The rebuilt culvert
of kilometre 172 seemed still the fittest place. While we stood by it
there came a rumbling, and through the gathering darkness and mist a
train suddenly appeared round the northern curve, only two hundred yards
away. We scurried under the long arch and heard it roll over-head. This
was annoying; but when the course was clear again we fell to burying the
charge. The evening was bitterly cold, with drifts of rain blowing down
the valley.</p>
<p>The arch was solid masonry, of four metres span, and stood over a
shingle water-bed which took its rise on our hill-top. The winter rains
had cut this into a channel four feet deep, narrow and winding, which
served us as an admirable approach till within three hundred yards of
the line. There the gully widened out and ran straight towards the
culvert, open to the sight of anyone upon the rails.</p>
<p>We hid the explosive carefully on the crown of the arch, deeper than
usual, beneath a tie, so that the patrols would not feel its jelly
softness under their feet. The wires were taken down the bank into the
shingle bed of the watercourse, where concealment was quick; and up it
as far as they would reach. Unfortunately, this was only sixty yards,
for there had been difficulty in Egypt over insulated cable and no more
had been available when our expedition started. Sixty yards was plenty
for the bridge, but little for a train: however, the ends happened to
coincide with a little bush about ten inches high, on the edge of the
watercourse, and we buried them beside this very convenient mark. It was
impossible to leave them joined up to the exploder in the proper way,
since the spot was evident to the permanent-way patrols as they made
their rounds.</p>
<p>Owing to the mud the job took longer than usual, and it was very
nearly dawn before we finished. I waited under the draughty arch till
day broke, wet and dismal, and then I went over the whole area of
disturbance, spending another half-hour in effacing its every mark,
scattering leaves and dead grass over it, and watering down the broken
mud from a shallow rain-pool near. Then they waved to me that the first
patrol was coming, and I went up to join the others.</p>
<p>Before I had reached them they came tearing down into their
prearranged places, lining the watercourse and spurs each side. A train
was coming from the north. Hamud, Feisal’s long slave, had the exploder;
but before he reached me a short train of closed box-waggons rushed by
at speed. The rainstorms on the plain and the thick morning had hidden
it from the eyes of our watchman until too late. This second failure
saddened us further and Ali began to say that nothing would come right
this trip. Such a statement held risk as prelude of the discovery of an
evil eye present; so, to divert attention, I suggested new watching
posts be sent far out, one to the ruins on the north, one to the great
cairn of the southern crest.</p>
<p>The rest, having no breakfast, were to pretend not to be hungry. They
all enjoyed doing this, and for a while we sat cheerfully in the rain,
huddling against one another for warmth behind a breastwork of our
streaming camels. The moisture made the animals’ hair curl up like a
fleece, so that they looked queerly dishevelled. When the rain paused,
which it did frequently, a cold moaning wind searched out the
unprotected parts of us very thoroughly. After a time we found our
wetted shirts clammy and comfortless things. We had nothing to eat,
nothing to do and nowhere to sit except on wet rock, wet grass or mud.
However, this persistent weather kept reminding me that it would delay
Allenby’s advance on Jerusalem, and rob him of his great possibility. So
large a misfortune to our lion was a half-encouragement for the mice. We
would be partners into next year.</p>
<p>In the best circumstances, waiting for action was hard. To-day it was
beastly. Even enemy patrols stumbled along without care, perfunctorily,
against the rain. At last, near noon, in a snatch of fine weather, the
watchmen on the south peak flagged their cloaks wildly in signal of a
train. We reached our positions in an instant, for we had squatted the
late hours on our heels in a streaming ditch near the line, so as not to
miss another chance. The Arabs took cover properly. I looked back at
their ambush from my firing point, and saw nothing but the grey
hill-sides.</p>
<p>I could not hear the train coming, but trusted, and knelt ready for
perhaps half an hour, when the suspense became intolerable, and I
signalled to know what was up. They sent down to say it was coming very
slowly, and was an enormously long train. Our appetites stiffened. The
longer it was the more would be the loot. Then came word that it had
stopped. It moved again.</p>
<p>Finally, near one o’clock, I heard it panting. The locomotive was
evidently defective (all these wood-fired trains were bad), and the
heavy load on the up-gradient was proving too much for its capacity. I
crouched behind my bush, while it crawled slowly into view past the
south cutting, and along the bank above my head towards the culvert. The
first ten trucks were open trucks, crowded with troops. However, once
again it was too late to choose, so when the engine was squarely over
the mine I pushed down the handle of the exploder. Nothing happened. I
sawed it up and down four times.</p>
<p>Still nothing happened; and I realized that it had gone out of order,
and that I was kneeling on a naked bank, with a Turkish troop train
crawling past fifty yards away. The bush, which had seemed a foot high,
shrank smaller than a fig-leaf; and I felt myself the most distinct
object in the country-side. Behind me was an open valley for two hundred
yards to the cover where my Arabs were waiting and wondering what I was
at. It was impossible to make a bolt for it, or the Turks would step off
the train and finish us. If I sat still, there might be just a hope of
my being ignored as a casual Bedouin.</p>
<p>So there I sat, counting for sheer life, while eighteen open trucks,
three box-waggons, and three officers’ coaches dragged by. The engine
panted slower and slower, and I thought every moment that it would break
down. The troops took no great notice of me, but the officers were
interested, and came out to the little platforms at the ends of their
carriages, pointing and staring. I waved back at them, grinning
nervously, and feeling an improbable shepherd in my Meccan dress, with
its twisted golden circlet about my head. Perhaps the mud-stains, the
wet and their ignorance made me accepted. The end of the brake van
slowly disappeared into the cutting on the north.</p>
<p>As it went, I jumped up, buried my wires, snatched hold of the
wretched exploder, and went like a rabbit uphill into safety. There I
took breath and looked back to see that the train had finally stuck. It
waited, about five hundred yards beyond the mine, for nearly an hour to
get up a head of steam, while an officers’ patrol came back and
searched, very carefully, the ground where I had been sitting. However
the wires were properly hidden: they found nothing: the engine plucked
up heart again, and away they went.</p>
