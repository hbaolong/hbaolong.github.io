<h4 id="chapter-c">CHAPTER C</h4>
<p>XMY bodyguard waited in two long lines on the hill-side. Joyce was
staying at Tell Arar as covering force, with a hundred of Nuri Said’s
men, the Rualla, the Ghurkas and the cars; while we slipped across to
break the Palestine Railway. My party would look like Beduins, so I
determined to move openly to Mezerib by the quickest course, for we were
very late.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we drew enemy attention. An aeroplane crawled over us,
dropping bombs: one, two, three, misses: the fourth into our midst. Two
of my men went down. Their camels, in bleeding masses, struggled on the
ground. The men had not a scratch, and leaped up behind two of their
friends. Another machine floated past us, its engine cut off. Two more
bombs, and a shock which spun my camel round, and knocked me half out of
the saddle with a burning numbness in my right elbow. I felt I was hard
hit, and began to cry for the pity of it: to be put out just when
another day’s control would have meant a vast success. The blood was
running down my arm: perhaps if I did not look at it I might carry on as
if I were unhurt.</p>
<p>My camel swung to a spatter of machine-gun bullets. I clutched at the
pommel, and found my damaged arm there and efficient. I had judged it
blown off. My left hand threw the cloak aside and explored for the wound
— to feel only a very hot little splinter of metal too light to do real
harm after driving through the massed folds of my cloak. The trifle
showed how much my nerve was on edge. Curiously enough it was the first
time I had been hit from the air.</p>
<p>We opened out and rode greatly, knowing the ground by heart; checking
only to tell the young peasants we met that the work was now at Mezerib.
The field-paths were full of these fellows, pouring out afoot from every
village to help us. They were very willing: but our eyes had rested so
long on the brown leanness of desert men that these gay village lads
with their flushed faces, clustering hair, and plump pale arms and legs
seemed like girls. They had kilted up their gowns above the knee for
fast work: and the more active raced beside us through the fields,
chaffing back my veterans.</p>
<p>As we reached Mezerib, Durzi ibn Dughmi met us, with news that Nuri
Said’s soldiers were only two miles back. We watered our camels, and
drank deeply ourselves, for it had been a long, hot day, and was not
ended. Then from behind the old fort we looked over the lake, and saw
movement in the French railway station.</p>
<p>Some of the white-legged fellows told us that the Turks held it in
force. However the approaches were too tempting. Abdulla led our charge,
for my days of adventure were ended, with the sluggard excuse that my
skin must be kept for a justifying emergency. Otherwise I wanted to
enter Damascus. This job was too easy. Abdulla found grain: also flour;
and some little booty of weapons, horses, ornaments. These excited my
hangers-on. New adherents came running across the grass, like flies to
honey. Tallal arrived at his constant gallop. We passed the stream, and
walked together up the far bank knee-deep in weeds till we saw the
Turkish station three hundred yards in front. We might capture this
before attacking the great bridge below Tell el Shehab. Tallal advanced
carelessly. Turks showed themselves to right and left: ‘It’s all right,’
said he, ‘I know the stationmaster’: but when we were two hundred yards
away, twenty rifles fired a shocking volley at us. We dropped unhurt
into the weeds (nearly all of them thistles), and crawled gingerly back,
Tallal swearing.</p>
<p>My men heard him, or the shots, and came streaming up from the river:
but we returned them, fearing a machine-gun in the station buildings.
Nuri Said was due. He arrived with Nasir, and we considered the
business. Nuri pointed out that delay at Mezerib might lose us the
bridge, a greater objective. I agreed, but thought this bird in hand
might suffice, since Peake’s main line demolition would stand for a
week, and the week’s end bring a new situation.</p>
<p>So Pisani unfolded his willing guns and smashed in a few rounds of
point-blank high explosive. Under their cover, with our twenty
machine-guns making a roof overhead, Nuri walked forward, gloved and
sworded, to receive the surrender of the forty soldiers left alive.</p>
<p>Upon this most rich station hundreds of Haurani peasants hurled
themselves in frenzy, plundering. Men, women and children fought like
dogs over every object. Doors and windows, door-frames and
window-frames, even steps of the stairs, were carried off. One hopeful
blew in the safe and found postage stamps inside. Others smashed open
the long range of waggons in the siding, to find all manner of goods.
Tons were carried off. Yet more were strewn in wreckage on the
ground.</p>
<p>Young and I cut the telegraph, here an important network of trunk and
local lines, indeed the Palestine army’s main link with their homeland.
It was pleasant to imagine Liman von Sandars’ fresh curse, in Nazareth,
as each severed wire tanged back from the clippers. We did them slowly,
with ceremony, to draw out the indignation. The Turks’ hopeless lack of
initiative made their army a ‘directed’ one, so that by destroying the
telegraphs we went far towards turning them into a leaderless mob. After
the telegraph we blew in the points, and planted tulips: not very many,
but enough to annoy. While we worked a light engine came down the line
from Deraa on patrol. The bang and dust-clouds of our tulips perturbed
it. It withdrew discreetly. Later an aeroplane visited us.</p>
<p>Among the captured rolling stock, on platform trucks, were two
lorries crammed with delicacies for some German canteen. The Arabs,
distrusting tins and bottles, had spoiled nearly everything: but we got
some soups and meat, and later Nuri Said gave us bottled asparagus. He
had found an Arab prising open the case and had cried ‘pigs’ bones’ at
him in horror when the contents came to light. The peasant spat and
dropped it, and Nuri quickly stuffed all he could into his
saddle-bags.</p>
<p>The lorries had huge petrol tanks. Beyond them were some trucks of
firewood. We set the whole afire at sunset, when the plundering was
finished, and the troops and tribesmen had fallen back to the soft grass
by the outlet from the lake.</p>
<p>The splendid blaze spreading along the line of waggons illuminated
our evening meal. The wood burned with a solid glare, and the fiery
tongues and bursts of the petrol went towering up, higher than the
water-tanks. We let the men make bread and sup and rest, before a
night-attempt on the Shehab bridge, which lay three miles to the
westward. We had meant to attack at dark, but the wish for food stopped
us, and then we had swarms of visitors, for our beacon-light advertised
us over half Hauran.</p>
<p>Visitors were our eyes, and had to be welcomed. My business was to
see every one with news, and let him talk himself out to me, afterwards
arranging and combining the truth of these points into a complete
picture in my mind. Complete, because it gave me certainty of judgement:
but it was not conscious nor logical, for my informants were so many
that they informed me to distraction, and my single mind bent under all
its claims.</p>
<p>Men came pouring down from the north on horse, on camel, and on foot,
hundreds and hundreds of them in a terrible grandeur of enthusiasm,
thinking this was the final occupation of the country, and that Nasir
would seal his victory by taking Deraa in the night. Even the
magistrates of Deraa came to open us their town. By acceding we should
hold the water supply of the railway station, which must inevitably
yield: yet later, if the ruin of the Turkish army came but slowly, we
might be forced out again, and lose the plainsmen between Deraa and
Damascus, in whose hands our final victory lay. A nice calculation, if
hardly a fresh one, but on the whole the arguments were still against
taking Deraa. Again we had to put off our friends with excuses within
their comprehension.</p>
