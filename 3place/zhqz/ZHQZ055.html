<h4 id="chapter-xliv">CHAPTER XLIV</h4>
<p>I WAS too weary, and too little sporting, to go out of the straight
way for all the rare beasts in the world; so I rode after the caravan,
which my camel overhauled quickly with her longer stride. At the tail of
it were my men, walking. They feared that some of their animals would be
dead before evening, if the wind blew stronger, but were leading them by
hand in hope of getting them in. I admired the contrast between Mohammed
the lusty, heavy-footed peasant, and the lithe Ageyl, with Farraj and
Daud dancing along, barefooted, delicate as thoroughbreds. Only Gasim
was not there: they thought him among the Howeitat, for his surliness
offended the laughing soldiery and kept him commonly with the Beduin,
who were more of his kidney.</p>
<p>There was no one behind, so I rode forward wishing to see how his
camel was: and at last found it, riderless, being led by one of the
Howeitat. His saddle-bags were on it, and his rifle and his food, but he
himself nowhere; gradually it dawned on us that the miserable man was
lost. This was a dreadful business, for in the haze and mirage the
caravan could not be seen two miles, and on the iron ground it made no
tracks: afoot he would never overtake us.</p>
<p>Everyone had marched on, thinking him elsewhere in our loose line;
but much time had passed and it was nearly midday, so he must be miles
back. His loaded camel was proof that he had not been forgotten asleep
at our night halt. The Ageyl ventured that perhaps he had dozed in the
saddle and fallen, stunning or killing himself: or perhaps some-one of
the party had borne him a grudge. Anyway they did not know. He was an
ill-natured stranger, no charge on any of them, and they did not greatly
care.</p>
<p>True: but it was true also that Mohammed, his countryman and fellow,
who was technically his road-companion, knew nothing of the desert, had
a foundered camel, and could not turn back for him.</p>
<p>If I sent him, it would be murder. That shifted the difficulty to my
shoulders. The Howeitat, who would have helped, were away in the mirage
out of sight, hunting or scouting. Ibn Dgheithir’s Ageyl were so
clannish that they would not put themselves about except for one
another. Besides Gasim was my man: and upon me lay the responsibility of
him.</p>
<p>I looked weakly at my trudging men, and wondered for a moment if I
could change with one, sending him back on my camel to the rescue. My
shirking the duty would be understood, because I was a foreigner: but
that was precisely the plea I did not dare set up, while I yet presumed
to help these Arabs in their own revolt. It was hard, anyway, for a
stranger to influence another people’s national movement, and doubly
hard for a Christian and a sedentary person to sway Moslem nomads. I
should make it impossible for myself if I claimed, simultaneously, the
privileges of both societies.</p>
<p>So, without saying anything, I turned my unwilling camel round, and
forced her, grunting and moaning for her camel friends, back past the
long line of men, and past the baggage into the emptiness behind. My
temper was very unheroic, for I was furious with my other servants, with
my own play-acting as a Beduin, and most of all with Gasim, a
gap-toothed, grumbling fellow, skrimshank in all our marches,
bad-tempered, suspicious, brutal, a man whose engagement I regretted,
and of whom I had promised to rid myself as soon as we reached a
discharging-place. It seemed absurd that I should peril my weight in the
Arab adventure for a single worthless man.</p>
<p>My camel seemed to feel it also, by her deep grumbling; but that was
a constant recourse of ill-treated camels. From calfhood they were
accustomed to live in droves, and some grew too conventional to march
alone: while none would leave their habitual party without loud grief
and unwillingness, such as mine was showing. She turned her head back on
her long neck, lowing to the rest, and walked very slowly, and
bouncingly. It needed careful guidance to hold her on the road, and a
tap from my stick at every pace to keep her moving. However, after a
mile or two, she felt better, and began to go forward less
constrainedly, but still slowly. I had been noting our direction all
these days with my oil compass, and hoped, by its aid, to return nearly
to our starting place, seventeen miles away.</p>
<p>Before twenty minutes, the caravan was out of sight, and it was borne
in on me how really barren the Bisaita was. Its only marks were the old
sanded samh pits, across all possible of which I rode, because my camel
tracks would show in them, and be so many blazes of the way back. This
samh was the wild flour of the Sherarat; who, poor in all but
camel-stocks, made it a boast to find the desert sufficient for their
every need. When mixed with dates and loosened with butter, it was good
food.</p>
<p>The pits, little threshing floors, were made by pushing aside the
flints over a circle of ten feet across. The flints, heaped up round the
rim of the pit, made it inches deep, and in this hollow place the women
collected and beat out the small red seed. The constant winds, sweeping
since over them, could not indeed put back the flint surface (that would
perhaps be done by the rain in thousands of winters), but had levelled
them up with pale blown sand, so that the pits were grey eyes in the
black stony surface.</p>
<p>I had ridden about an hour and a half, easily, for the following
breeze had let me wipe the crust from my red eyes and look forward
almost without pain: when I saw a figure, or large bush, or at least
something black ahead of me. The shifting mirage disguised height or
distance; but this thing seemed moving, a little east of our course. On
chance I turned my camel’s head that way, and in a few minutes saw that
it was Gasim. When I called he stood confusedly; I rode up and saw that
he was nearly blinded and silly, standing there with his arms held out
to me, and his black mouth gaping open. The Ageyl had put our last water
in my skin, and this he spilled madly over his face and breast, in haste
to drink. He stopped babbling, and began to wail out his sorrows. I sat
him, pillion, on the camel’s rump; then stirred her up and mounted.</p>
<p>At our turn the beast seemed relieved, and moved forward freely. I
set an exact compass course, so exact that often I found our old tracks,
as little spurts of paler sand scattered over the brown-black flint. In
spite of our double weight the camel began to stride out, and at times
she even put her head down and for a few paces developed that fast and
most comfortable shuffle to which the best animals, while young, were
broken by skilled riders. This proof of reserve spirit in her rejoiced
me, as did the little time lost in search.</p>
<p>Gasim was moaning impressively about the pain and terror of his
thirst: I told him to stop; but he went on, and began to sit loosely;
until at each step of the camel he bumped down on her hinder quarters
with a crash, which, like his crying, spurred her to greater pace. There
was danger in this, for we might easily founder her so. Again I told him
to stop, and when he only screamed louder, hit him and swore that for
another sound I would throw him off. The threat, to which my general
rage gave colour, worked. After it he clung on grimly without sound.</p>
<p>Not four miles had passed when again I saw a black bubble, lunging
and swaying in the mirage ahead. It split into three, and swelled. I
wondered if they were enemy. A minute later the haze unrolled with the
disconcerting suddenness of illusion; and it was Auda with two of
Nasir’s men come back to look for me. I yelled jests and scoffs at them
for abandoning a friend in the desert. Auda pulled his beard and
grumbled that had he been present I would never have gone back. Gasim
was transferred with insults to a better rider’s saddle-pad, and we
ambled forward together.</p>
<p>Auda pointed to the wretched hunched-up figure and denounced me. ‘For
that thing, not worth a camel’s price…’ I interrupted him with ‘Not
worth a half-crown, Auda’, and he, delighted in his simple mind, rode
near Gasim, and struck him sharply, trying to make him repeat, like a
parrot, his price. Gasim bared his broken teeth in a grin of rage and
afterwards sulked on. In another hour we were on the heels of the
baggage camels, and as we passed up the inquisitive line of our caravan,
Auda repeated my joke to each pair, perhaps forty times in all, till I
had seen to the full its feebleness.</p>
<p>Gasim explained that he had dismounted to ease nature, and had missed
the party afterwards in the dark: but, obviously, he had gone to sleep,
where he dismounted, with the fatigue of our slow, hot journeying. We
rejoined Nasir and Nesib in the van. Nesib was vexed with me, for
perilling the lives of Auda and myself on a whim. It was clear to him
that I reckoned they would come back for me. Nasir was shocked at his
ungenerous outlook, and Auda was glad to rub into a townsman the paradox
of tribe and city; the collective responsibility and group-brotherhood
of the desert, contrasted with the isolation and competitive living of
the crowded districts.</p>
<p>Over this little affair hours had passed, and the rest of the day
seemed not so long; though the heat became worse, and the sand-blast
stiffened in our faces till the air could be seen and heard, whistling
past our camels like smoke. The ground was flat and featureless till
five o’clock, when we saw low mounds ahead, and a little later found
ourselves in comparative peace, amid sand-hills coated slenderly with
tamarisk. These were the Kaseim of Sirhan. The bushes and the dunes
broke the wind, it was sunset, and the evening mellowed and reddened on
us from the west. So I wrote in my diary that Sirhan was beautiful.</p>
<p>Palestine became a land of milk and honey to those who had spent
forty years in Sinai: Damascus had the name of an earthly paradise to
the tribes which could enter it only after weeks and weeks of painful
marching across the flint-stones of this northern desert: and likewise
the Kaseim of Arfaja in which we spent that night, after five days
across the blazing Houl in the teeth of a sand-storm, looked fresh and
countryfied. They were raised only a few feet above the Biseita, and
from them valleys seemed to run down towards the east into a huge
depression where lay the well we wanted: but now that we had crossed the
desert and reached the Sirhan safely, the terror of thirst had passed
and we knew fatigue to be our chief ill. So we agreed to camp for the
night where we were, and to make beacon fires for the slave of Nuri
Shaalan, who, like Gasim, had disappeared from our caravan to-day.</p>
<p>We were not greatly perturbed about him. He knew the country and his
camel was under him. It might be that he had intentionally taken the
direct way to Jauf, Nuri’s capital, to earn the reward of first news
that we came with gifts. However it was, he did not come that night, nor
next day; and when, months after, I asked Nuri of him, he replied that
his dried body had lately been found, lying beside his unplundered camel
far out in the wilderness. He must have lost himself in the sand-haze
and wandered till his camel broke down; and there died of thirst and
heat. Not a long death — even for the very strongest a second day in
summer was all — but very painful; for thirst was an active malady; a
fear and panic which tore at the brain and reduced the bravest man to a
stumbling babbling maniac in an hour or two: and then the sun killed
him.</p>
