<h4 id="introductory-chapter">INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER</h4>
<p>THE story which follows was first written out in Paris during the
Peace Conference, from notes jotted daily on the march, strengthened by
some reports sent to my chiefs in Cairo. Afterwards, in the autumn of
1919, this first draft and some of the notes were lost. It seemed to me
historically needful to reproduce the tale, as perhaps no one but myself
in Feisal’s army had thought of writing down at the time what we felt,
what we hoped, what we tried. So it was built again with heavy
repugnance in London in the winter of 1919-20 from memory and my
surviving notes. The record of events was not dulled in me and perhaps
few actual mistakes crept in — except in details of dates or numbers —
but the outlines and significance of things had lost edge in the haze of
new interests.</p>
<p>Dates and places are correct, so far as my notes preserved them: but
the personal names are not. Since the adventure some of those who worked
with me have buried themselves in the shallow grave of public duty. Free
use has been made of their names. Others still possess themselves, and
here keep their secrecy. Sometimes one man carried various names. This
may hide individuality and make the book a scatter of featureless
puppets, rather than a group of living people: but once good is told of
a man, and again evil, and some would not thank me for either blame or
praise.</p>
<p>This isolated picture throwing the main light upon myself is unfair
to my British colleagues. Especially I am most sorry that I have not
told what the non-commissioned of us did. They were inarticulate, but
wonderful, especially when it is taken into account that they had not
the motive, the imaginative vision of the end, which sustained the
officers. Unfortunately my concern was limited to this end, and the book
is just a designed procession of Arab freedom from Mecca to Damascus. It
is intended to rationalize the campaign, that everyone may see how
natural the success was and how inevitable, how little dependent on
direction or brain, how much less on the outside assistance of the few
British. It was an Arab war waged and led by Arabs for an Arab aim in
Arabia.</p>
<p>My proper share was a minor one, but because of a fluent pen, a free
speech, and a certain adroitness of brain, I took upon myself, as I
describe it, a mock primacy. In reality I never had any office among the
Arabs: was never in charge of the British mission with them. Wilson,
Joyce, Newcombe, Dawnay and Davenport were all over my head. I flattered
myself that I was too young, not that they had more heart or mind in the
work. I did my best. Wilson, Newcombe, Joyce, Dawnay, Davenport, Buxton,
Marshall, Stirling, Young, Maynard, Ross, Scott, Winterton, Lloyd,
Wordie, Siddons, Goslett, Stent, Henderson, Spence, Gilman, Garland,
Brodie, Makins, Nunan, Leeson, Hornby, Peake, Scott-Higgins, Ramsay,
Wood, Hinde, Bright, MacIndoe, Greenhill, Grisenthwaite, Dowsett,
Bennett, Wade, Gray, Pascoe and the others also did their best.</p>
<p>It would be impertinent in me to praise them. When I wish to say ill
of one outside our number, I do it: though there is less of this than
was in my diary, since the passage of time seems to have bleached out
men’s stains. When I wish to praise outsiders, I do it: but our family
affairs are our own. We did what we set out to do, and have the
satisfaction of that knowledge. The others have liberty some day to put
on record their story, one parallel to mine but not mentioning more of
me than I of them, for each of us did his job by himself and as he
pleased, hardly seeing his friends.</p>
<p>In these pages the history is not of the Arab movement, but of me in
it. It is a narrative of daily life, mean happenings, little people.
Here are no lessons for the world, no disclosures to shock peoples. It
is filled with trivial things, partly that no one mistake for history
the bones from which some day a man may make history, and partly for the
pleasure it gave me to recall the fellowship of the revolt. We were fond
together, because of the sweep of the open places, the taste of wide
winds, the sunlight, and the hopes in which we worked. The morning
freshness of the world-to-be intoxicated us. We were wrought up with
ideas inexpressible and vaporous, but to be fought for. We lived many
lives in those whirling campaigns, never sparing ourselves: yet when we
achieved and the new world dawned, the old men came out again and took
our victory to re-make in the likeness of the former world they knew.
Youth could win, but had not learned to keep: and was pitiably weak
against age. We stammered that we had worked for a new heaven and a new
earth, and they thanked us kindly and made their peace.</p>
<p>All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty
recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but
the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dream
with open eyes, to make it possible. This I did. I meant to make a new
nation, to restore a lost influence, to give twenty millions of Semites
the foundations on which to build an inspired dream-palace of their
national thoughts. So high an aim called out the inherent nobility of
their minds, and made them play a generous part in events: but when we
won, it was charged against me that the British petrol royalties in
Mesopotamia were become dubious, and French Colonial policy ruined in
the Levant.</p>
<p>I am afraid that I hope so. We pay for these things too much in
honour and in innocent lives. I went up the Tigris with one hundred
Devon Territorials, young, clean, delightful fellows, full of the power
of happiness and of making women and children glad. By them one saw
vividly how great it was to be their kin, and English. And we were
casting them by thousands into the fire to the worst of deaths, not to
win the war but that the corn and rice and oil of Mesopotamia might be
ours. The only need was to defeat our enemies (Turkey among them), and
this was at last done in the wisdom of Allenby with less than four
hundred killed, by turning to our uses the hands of the oppressed in
Turkey. I am proudest of my thirty fights in that I did not have any of
our own blood shed. All our subject provinces to me were not worth one
dead Englishman.</p>
<p>We were three years over this effort and I have had to hold back many
things which may not yet be said. Even so, parts of this book will be
new to nearly all who see it, and many will look for familiar things and
not find them. Once I reported fully to my chiefs, but learnt that they
were rewarding me on my own evidence. This was not as it should be.
Honours may be necessary in a professional army, as so many emphatic
mentions in despatches, and by enlisting we had put ourselves, willingly
or not, in the position of regular soldiers.</p>
<p>For my work on the Arab front I had determined to accept nothing. The
Cabinet raised the Arabs to fight for us by definite promises of
self-government afterwards. Arabs believe in persons, not in
institutions. They saw in me a free agent of the British Government, and
demanded from me an endorsement of its written promises. So I had to
join the conspiracy, and, for what my word was worth, assured the men of
their reward. In our two years’ partnership under fire they grew
accustomed to believing me and to think my Government, like myself,
sincere. In this hope they performed some fine things, but, of course,
instead of being proud of what we did together, I was continually and
bitterly ashamed.</p>
<p>It was evident from the beginning that if we won the war these
promises would be dead paper, and had I been an honest adviser of the
Arabs I would have advised them to go home and not risk their lives
fighting for such stuff: but I salved myself with the hope that, by
leading these Arabs madly in the final victory I would establish them,
with arms in their hands, in a position so assured (if not dominant)
that expediency would counsel to the Great Powers a fair settlement of
their claims. In other words, I presumed (seeing no other leader with
the will and power) that I would survive the campaigns, and be able to
defeat not merely the Turks on the battlefield, but my own country and
its allies in the council-chamber. It was an immodest presumption: it is
not yet clear if I succeeded: but it is clear that I had no shadow of
leave to engage the Arabs, unknowing, in such hazard. I risked the
fraud, on my conviction that Arab help was necessary to our cheap and
speedy victory in the East, and that better we win and break our word
than lose.</p>
<p>The dismissal of Sir Henry McMahon confirmed my belief in our
essential insincerity: but I could not so explain myself to General
Wingate while the war lasted, since I was nominally under his orders,
and he did not seem sensible of how false his own standing was. The only
thing remaining was to refuse rewards for being a successful trickster
and, to prevent this unpleasantness arising, I began in my reports to
conceal the true stories of things, and to persuade the few Arabs who
knew to an equal reticence. In this book also, for the last time, I mean
to be my own judge of what to say.</p>
