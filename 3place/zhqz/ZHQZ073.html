<h4 id="chapter-lxii">CHAPTER LXII</h4>
<p>GLADLY we left the noise and heart-burning of Guweira. So soon as we
had lost our escort of flies we halted: indeed there was no need of
haste, and the two unfortunate fellows with me were tasting of such heat
as they had never known; for the stifling air was like a metal mask over
our faces. It was admirable to see them struggle not to speak of it,
that they might keep the spirit of the Akaba undertaking to endure as
firmly as the Arabs; but by this silence the sergeants went far past
their bond. It was ignorance of Arabic which made them so superfluously
brave, for the Arabs themselves were loud against the tyrannous sun and
the breathlessness; but the test-effect was wholesome; and, for effect,
I played about, seeming to enjoy myself.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon we marched further and stopped for the night
under a thick screen of tamarisk-trees. The camp was very beautiful, for
behind us rose a cliff, perhaps four hundred feet in height, a deep red
in the level sunset. Under our feet was spread a floor of buff-coloured
mud, as hard and muffled as wood-paving, flat like a lake for half a
mile each way: and on a low ridge to one side of it stood the grove of
tamarisk-stems of brown wood, edged with a sparse and dusty fringe of
green, which had been faded by drought and sunshine till it was nearly
of the silvered grey below the olive-leaves about Les Baux when a wind
from the river-mouth rustled up the valley-grass and made the trees turn
pale.</p>
<p>We were riding for Rumm, the northern water of the Beni Atiyeh: a
place which stirred my thought, as even the unsentimental Howeitat had
told me it was lovely. The morrow would be new with our entry to it: but
very early while the stars were yet shining, I was roused by Aid, the
humble Harithi Sherif accompanying us. He crept to me, and said in a
chilled voice, ‘Lord, I am gone blind.’ I made him lie down, and felt
that he shivered as if cold; but all he could tell me was that in the
night, waking up, there had been no sight, only pain in his eyes. The
sun-blink had burned them out.</p>
<p>Day was still young as we rode between two great pikes of sandstone
to the foot of a long, soft slope poured down from the domed hills in
front of us. It was tamarisk-covered: the beginning of the Valley of
Rumm, they said. We looked up on the left to a long wall of rock,
sheering in like a thousand-foot wave towards the middle of the valley;
whose other arc, to the right, was an opposing line of steep, red broken
hills. We rode up the slope, crashing our way through the brittle
undergrowth.</p>
<p>As we went, the brushwood grouped itself into thickets whose massed
leaves took on a stronger tint of green the purer for their contrasted
setting in plots of open sand of a cheerful delicate pink. The ascent
became gentle, till the valley was a confined tilted plain. The hills on
the right grew taller and sharper, a fair counterpart of the other side
which straightened itself to one massive rampart of redness. They drew
together until only two miles divided them: and then, towering gradually
till their parallel parapets must have been a thousand feet above us,
ran forward in an avenue for miles.</p>
<p>They were not unbroken walls of rock, but were built sectionally, in
crags like gigantic buildings, along the two sides of their street. Deep
alleys, fifty feet across, divided the crags, whose plans were smoothed
by the weather into huge apses and bays, and enriched with surface
fretting and fracture, like design. Caverns high up on the precipice
were round like windows: others near the foot gaped like doors. Dark
stains ran down the shadowed front for hundreds of feet, like accidents
of use. The cliffs were striated vertically, in their granular rock;
whose main order stood on two hundred feet of broken stone deeper in
colour and harder in texture. This plinth did not, like the sandstone,
hang in folds like cloth; but chipped itself into loose courses of
scree, horizontal as the footings of a wall.</p>
<p>The crags were capped in nests of domes, less hotly red than the body
of the hill; rather grey and shallow. They gave the finishing semblance
of Byzantine architecture to this irresistible place: this processional
way greater than imagination. The Arab armies would have been lost in
the length and breadth of it, and within the walls a squadron of
aeroplanes could have wheeled in formation. Our little caravan grew
self-conscious, and fell dead quiet, afraid and ashamed to flaunt its
smallness in the presence of the stupendous hills.</p>
<p>Landscapes, in childhood’s dream, were so vast and silent. We looked
backward through our memory for the prototype up which all men had
walked between such walls toward such an open square as that in front
where this road seemed to end. Later, when we were often riding inland,
my mind used to turn me from the direct road, to clear my senses by a
night in Rumm and by the ride down its dawn-lit valley towards the
shining plains, or up its valley in the sunset towards that glowing
square which my timid anticipation never let me reach. I would say,
‘Shall I ride on this time, beyond the Khazail, and know it all?’ But in
truth I liked Rumm too much.</p>
<p>To-day we rode for hours while the perspectives grew greater and more
magnificent in ordered design, till a gap in the cliff-face opened on
our right to a new wonder. The gap, perhaps three hundred yards across,
was a crevice in such a wall; and led to an amphitheatre, oval in shape,
shallow in front, and long-lobed right and left. The walls were
precipices, like all the walls of Rumm; but appeared greater, for the
pit lay in the very heart of a ruling hill, and its smallness made the
besetting heights seem overpowering.</p>
<p>The sun had sunk behind the western wall, leaving the pit in shadow;
but its dying glare flooded with startling red the wings each side of
the entry, and the fiery bulk of the further wall across the great
valley. The pit-floor was of damp sand, darkly wooded with shrubs; while
about the feet of all the cliffs lay boulders greater than houses,
sometimes, indeed, like fortresses which had crashed down from the
heights above. In front of us a path, pale with use, zigzagged up the
cliff-plinth to the point from which the main face rose, and there it
turned precariously southward along a shallow ledge outlined by
occasional leafy trees. From between these trees, in hidden crannies of
the rock, issued strange cries; the echoes, turned into music, of the
voices of the Arabs watering camels at the springs which there flowed
out three hundred feet above ground.</p>
<p>The rains, falling on the grey domes of the hill-top, seemed to have
soaked slowly into the porous rock; and my mind followed them, filtering
inch by inch downward through those mountains of sandstone till they
came against the impervious horizontal layer of the plinth, and ran
along its top under pressure, in jets which burst out on the cliff-face
at the junction of the two rocky layers.</p>
<p>Mohammed turned into the amphitheatre’s left hand lobe. At its far
end Arab ingenuity had cleared a space under an overhanging rock: there
we unloaded and settled down. The dark came upon us quickly in this high
prisoned place; and we felt the water-laden air cold against our
sunburnt skin. The Howeitat, who had looked after the loads of explosive
collected their camel drove, and led them with echo-testing shouts up
the hill-path to water against their early return to Guweira. We lit
fires and cooked rice to add to the sergeants’ bully-beef, while my
coffee men prepared for the visitors who would come to us.</p>
<p>The Arabs in the tents outside the hollow of the springs had seen us
enter, and were not slow to learn our news. In an hour we had the head
men of the Darausha, Zelebani, Zuweida and Togatga clans about us; and
there mounted great talk, none too happy. Aid, the Sherif, was too cast
down in heart by his blindness to lift the burden of entertainment from
my shoulders; and a work of such special requirements was not to be well
done by me. These smaller clans, angry with the Abu Tayi, suspected us
of abetting Auda in his ambition to win a predominance over them. They
were unwilling to serve the Sherif till assured of his support of their
extremest claims.</p>
<p>Gasim abu Dumeik, the fine horseman who had led the highland men on
the day of Aba el Lissan, seemed particularly vicious. He was a dark man
with an arrogant face and thin-lipped smile; good enough at heart, but
crusted. To-day, he flamed with jealousy of the Toweiha. Alone, I could
never win him, so to make patent his hostility I took him as adversary
and fought him fiercely with my tongue till he was silenced. In shame
his audience deserted him and rallied ever so little to my side. Their
flickering judgements began to murmur at the chiefs, and to advocate
marching off with me. I took the chance to say that Zaal would be here
in the morning, and that he and I would accept the help of all except
the Dhumaniyeh; who, made impossible by Gasim’s words, would be erased
from Feisal’s book and forfeit their earned goodwill and rewards. Gasim,
swearing he would join the Turks at once, withdrew from the fireside in
great anger, while cautious friends tried vainly to stop his mouth.</p>
