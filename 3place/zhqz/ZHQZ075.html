<h4 id="chapter-lxiv">CHAPTER LXIV</h4>
<p>ABDULLA made progress with his settlement. Gasim, no longer defiant,
but sulky, would not give public counsel: so about a hundred men of the
smaller clans dared defy him by promising to ride with us. We talked it
over with Zaal, and decided to try our fortune to the utmost of this
power. By longer delay we risked adherents whom we now had, with little
hope of getting others in the present temper of the tribes.</p>
<p>It was a tiny party, only a third of what had been hoped. Our
weakness would modify our plans regrettably: also we lacked an assured
leader. Zaal, as ever, showed himself capable of being chief, prescient
and active in all concrete preparations. He was a man of great mettle,
but too close to Auda to suit the others; and his sharp tongue and the
sneer hovering on his blue, wet lips fanned distrust and made men
reluctant to obey even his good advice.</p>
<p>Next day the baggage camels came from Feisal, twenty of them in
charge often freedmen, and guarded by four of his body-slaves. These
were the trustiest attendants in the army, with a quite particular
reading of the duties of personal service. They would have died to save
their master hurt, or have died with him if he were hurt. We attached
two to each sergeant, so that whatever happened to me their safe return
would be assured. The loads needed for the reduced raid were sorted out
and all made ready for an early start.</p>
<p>Accordingly at dawn on September the sixteenth we rode out from Rumm.
Aid, the blind Sherif, insisted on coming, despite his lost sight;
saying he could ride, if he could not shoot, and that if God prospered
us he would take leave from Feisal in the flush of the success, and go
home, not too sorry, to the blank life which would be left. Zaal led his
twenty-five Nowasera, a clan of Auda’s Arabs who called themselves my
men, and were famous the desert over for their saddle-camels. My hard
riding tempted them to my company.</p>
<p>Old Motlog el Awar, owner of el Jedha, the finest she-camel in North
Arabia, rode her in our van. We looked at her with proud or greedy eyes,
according to our relationship with him. My Ghazala was taller and more
grand, with a faster trot, but too old to be galloped. However, she was
the only other animal in the party, or, indeed, in this desert, to be
matched with the Jedha, and my honour was increased by her dignity.</p>
<p>The rest of our party strayed like a broken necklace. There were
groups of Zuweida, Darausha, Togatga, and Zelebani; and it was on this
ride that the virtue of Hammad el Tugtagi was first brought to my mind.
Half an hour after we started there rode out from a side-valley some
shame-faced men of the Dhumaniyeh, unable to endure others raiding while
they idled with the women.</p>
<p>No one group would ride or speak with another, and I passed back and
forth all day like a shuttle, talking first to one lowering sheikh, and
then to another, striving to draw them together, so that before a cry to
action came there might be solidarity. As yet they agreed only in not
hearing any word from Zaal as to the order of our march; though he was
admitted the most intelligent warrior, and the most experienced. For my
private part he was the only one to be trusted further than eyesight. Of
the others, it seemed to me that neither their words nor their counsels,
perhaps not their rifles, were sure.</p>
<p>Poor Sherif Aid’s uselessness, even as nominal leader, forced me to
assume the direction myself, against both principle and judgement; since
the special arts of tribal raiding and the details of food-halts and
pasturage, road-direction, pay, disputes, division of spoils, feuds and
march order were much outside the syllabus of the Oxford School of
Modern History. The need to vamp these matters kept me too busied to see
the country, and prevented my worrying out how we must assault
Mudowwara, and the best surprise uses of explosive.</p>
<p>We put our midday halt in a fertile place, where the late spring
rain, falling on a sandy talus, had brought up a thick tufting of
silvery grass which our camels loved. The weather was mild, perfect as
an August in England, and we lingered in great content, recovered at
last from the bickering appetites of the days before the start, and from
that slight rending of nerve inevitable when leaving even a temporary
settlement. Man, in our circumstances, took root so soon.</p>
<p>Late in the day we rode again, winding downhill in a narrow valley
between moderate sandstone walls: till before sunset we were out on
another flat of laid yellow mud, like that which had been so wonderful a
prelude to Rumm’s glory. By its edge we camped. My care had borne fruit,
for we settled in only three parties, by bright fires of crackling,
flaring tamarisk. At one supped my men; at the second Zaal; at the third
the other Howeitat; and late at night, when all the chiefs had been well
adjusted with gazelle meat and hot bread, it became possible to bring
them to my neutral fire, and discuss sensibly our course for the
morrow.</p>
<p>It seemed that about sunset we should water at Mudowwara well, two or
three miles this side of the station, in a covered valley. Then, in the
early night, we might go forward to examine the station and see if, in
our weakness, we might yet attempt some stroke against it. I held
strongly to this (against the common taste) for it was by so much the
most critical point of the line. The Arabs could not see it, since their
minds did not hold a picture of the long, linked Turkish front with its
necessitous demands. However, we had reached internal harmony, and
scattered confidently to sleep.</p>
<p>In the morning we delayed to eat again, having only six hours of
march before us; and then pushed across the mud-flat to a plain of firm
limestone rag, carpeted with brown, weather-blunted flint. This was
succeeded by low hills, with occasional soft beds of sand, under the
steeper slopes where eddying winds had dropped their dust. Through these
we rode up shallow valleys to a crest; and then by like valleys down the
far side, whence we issued abruptly, from dark, tossed stone-heaps into
the sun-steeped wideness of a plain. Across it an occasional low dune
stretched a drifting line.</p>
<p>We had made our noon halt at the first entering of the broken
country; and, rightly, in the late afternoon came to the well. It was an
open pool, a few yards square, in a hollow valley of large stone-slabs
and flint and sand. The stagnant water looked uninviting. Over its face
lay a thick mantle of green slime, from which swelled curious
bladder-islands of floating fatty pink. The Arabs explained that the
Turks had thrown dead camels into the pool to make the water foul; but
that time had passed and the effect was grown faint. It would have been
fainter had the criterion of their effort been my taste.</p>
<p>Yet it was all the drink we should get up here unless we took
Mudowwara, so we set to and filled our water-skins. One of the Howeitat,
while helping in this, slipped off the wet edge into the water. Its
green carpet closed oilily over his head and hid him for an instant:
then he came up, gasping vigorously, and scrambled out amid our
laughter; leaving behind him a black hole in the scum from which a
stench of old meat rose like a visible pillar, and hung about us and him
and the valley, disconcertingly.</p>
<p>At dusk, Zaal and I, with the sergeants and others, crept forward
quietly. In half an hour we were at the last crest, in a place where the
Turks had dug trenches and stoned up an elaborate outpost of engrailed
sangars which on this black new-moon night of our raid were empty. In
front and below lay the station, its doors and windows sharply marked by
the yellow cooking fires and lights of the garrison. It seemed close
under our observation; but the Stokes gun would carry only three hundred
yards. Accordingly we went nearer, hearing the enemy noises, and
attentively afraid lest their barking dogs uncover us. Sergeant Stokes
made casts out to left and right, in search of gun-positions, but found
nothing that was satisfactory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zaal and I crawled across the last flat, till we could
count the unlighted tents and hear the men talking. One came out a few
steps in our direction, then hesitated. He struck a match to light a
cigarette, and the bold light flooded his face, so that we saw him
plainly, a young, hollow-faced sickly officer. He squatted, busy for a
moment, and returned to his men, who hushed as he passed.</p>
<p>We moved back to our hill and consulted in whispers. The station was
very long, of stone buildings, so solid that they might be proof against
our time-fused shell. The garrison seemed about two hundred. We were one
hundred and sixteen rifles and not a happy family. Surprise was the only
benefit we could be sure of.</p>
<p>So, in the end, I voted that we leave it, unalarmed, for a future
occasion, which might be soon. But, actually, one accident after another
saved Mudowwara; and it was not until August, 1918, that Buxton’s Camel
Corps at last measured to it the fate so long overdue.</p>
