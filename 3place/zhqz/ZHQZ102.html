<h4 id="chapter-xci">CHAPTER XCI</h4>
<p>DIPLOMATICALLY, Hogarth replied not a word, but took me to breakfast
with Clayton. There I gathered that Smuts had come from the War Cabinet
to Palestine, with news which had changed our relative situation. For
days they had been trying to get me to the Conferences, and finally had
sent out aeroplanes to find Tafileh; but the pilots had dropped their
messages near Shobek, among Arabs too weather-daunted to move.</p>
<p>Clayton said that in the new conditions there could be no question of
letting me off. The East was only now going to begin. Allenby told me
that the War Cabinet were leaning heavily on him to repair the stalemate
of the West. He was to take at least Damascus; and, if possible, Aleppo,
as soon as he could. Turkey was to be put out of the war once and for
all. His difficulty lay with his eastern flank, the right, which to-day
rested on Jordan. He had called me to consider if the Arabs could
relieve him of its burden.</p>
<p>There was no escape for me. I must take up again my mantle of fraud
in the East. With my certain contempt for half-measures I took it up
quickly and wrapped myself in it completely. It might be fraud or it
might be farce: no one should say that I could not play it. So I did not
even mention the reasons which had brought me across; but pointed out
that this was the Jordan scheme seen from the British angle. Allenby
assented, and asked if we could still do it. I said: not at present,
unless new factors were first discounted.</p>
<p>The first was Maan. We should have to take it before we could afford
a second sphere. If more transport gave a longer range to the units of
the Arab Regular Army, they could take position some miles north of Maan
and cut the railway permanently, so forcing the Maan garrison to come
out and fight them; and in the field the Arabs would easily defeat the
Turks. We would require seven hundred baggage camels; more guns and
machine-guns; and lastly, assurance against flank attack from Amman,
while we dealt with Maan.</p>
<p>On this basis a scheme was worked out. Allenby ordered down to Akaba
two units of the Camel Transport Corps, an organization of Egyptians
under British officers, which had proved highly successful in the
Beersheba campaign. It was a great gift, for its carrying capacity
ensured that we should now be able to keep our four thousand regulars
eighty miles in advance of their base. The guns and machine-guns were
also promised. As for shielding us against attack from Amman, Allenby
said that was easily arranged. He intended, for his own flank’s
security, shortly to take Salt, beyond Jordan, and hold it with an
Indian Brigade. A Corps Conference was due next day, and I was to stay
for it.</p>
<p>At this Conference it was determined that the Arab Army move
instantly to the Maan Plateau to take Maan. That the British cross the
Jordan, occupy Salt, and destroy south of Amman as much of the railway
as possible; especially the great tunnel. It was debated what share the
Amman Arabs should take in the British operation. Bols thought we should
join in the advance. I opposed this, since the later retirement to Salt
would cause rumour and reaction, and it would be easier if we did not
enter till this had spent itself.</p>
<p>Chetwode, who was to direct the advance, asked how his men were to
distinguish friendly from hostile Arabs, since their tendency was a
prejudice against all wearing skirts. I was sitting skirted in their
midst and replied, naturally, that skirt-wearers disliked men in
uniform. The laugh clinched the question, and it was agreed that we
support the British retention of Salt only after they came to rest
there. As soon as Maan fell, the Arab Regulars would move up and draw
supplies from Jericho. The seven hundred camels would come along, still
giving them eighty miles, radius of action. This would be enough to let
them work above Amman in Allenby’s grand attack along the line from the
Mediterranean to the Dead Sea, the second phase of the operation,
directed to the capture of Damascus.</p>
<p>My business was finished. I went to Cairo for two days, and then was
flown to Akaba, to make my new terms with Feisal. I told him I thought
they had treated me badly, in diverting without my knowledge money of
the special account which, by agreement, I had drawn solely for the Dead
Sea campaign. Consequently, I had left Zeid, it being impossible for a
flouted adviser to carry on.</p>
<p>Allenby had sent me back. But my return did not mean that the damage
was repaired. A great opportunity had been missed, and a valuable
advance thrown away. The Turks would retake Tafileh in a week’s time
without difficulty.</p>
<p>Feisal was distressed lest the loss of Tafileh do his reputation
harm; and shocked by my little interest in its fate. To comfort him, I
pointed out that it now meant nothing to us. The two interests were the
extremes of his area, Amman and Maan. Tafileh was not worth losing a man
over; indeed, if the Turks moved there, they would weaken either Maan or
Amman, and make our real work easier.</p>
<p>He was a little reconciled by this, but sent urgent warnings to Zeid
of the coming danger: without avail, for six days later the Turks retook
Tafileh. Meanwhile, Feisal re-arranged the basis of his army funds. I
gave him the good news that Allenby, as thanks for the Dead Sea and Aba
el Lissan, had put three hundred thousand pounds into my independent
credit, and given us a train of seven hundred pack-camels complete with
personnel and equipment.</p>
<p>This raised great joy in all the army, for the baggage columns would
enable us to prove the value in the field of the Arab regular troops on
whose training and organization Joyce, Jaafar, and so many Arab and
English officers had worked for months. We arranged rough timetables and
schemes: then I shipped busily back to Egypt.</p>
<p>BOOK VIII</p>
<p>THE RUIN OF HIGH HOPE</p>
<p>Chapters XCII to XCVII</p>
<p>IN conjunction with Allenby we laid a triple plan to join hands
across Jordan, to capture Maan, and to cut off Medina, in one operation.
This was too proud and neither of us fulfilled his part. So the Arabs
exchanged the care of the placid Medina Railway for the greater burden
of investing, in Maan, a Turk force as big as their available Regular
Army.</p>
<p>To help in this duty Allenby increased our transport, that we might
have longer range and more mobility. Maan was impregnable for us, so we
concentrated on cutting its northern railway and diverting the Turkish
effort to relieve its garrison from the Amman side.</p>
<p>Clearly no decision lay in such tactics: but the German advance in
Flanders at this moment took from Allenby his British units; and
consequently his advantage over the Turks. He notified us that he was
unable to attack.</p>
<p>A stalemate, as we were, throughout 1918 was an intolerable prospect.
We schemed to strengthen the Arab Army for autumn operations near Deraa
and in the Beni Sakhr country. If this drew off one division from the
enemy in Palestine it would make possible a British ancillary attack,
one of whose ends would be our junction in the lower Jordan valley, by
Jericho. After a month’s preparation this plan was dropped, because of
its risk, and because a better offered.</p>
