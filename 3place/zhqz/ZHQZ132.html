<h4 id="chapter-cxxi">CHAPTER CXXI</h4>
<p>QUIVERINGLY a citizen woke me, with word that Abd el Kadir was making
rebellion. I sent over to Nuri Said, glad the Algerian fool was digging
his own pit. He had called his men, told them these Sherifs were only
English creatures, and conjured them to strike a blow for religion and
the Caliph while there was yet time. They, simple retainers with an
ingrained habit of obedience, took his word for it, and set out to make
war on us.</p>
<p>The Druses, for whose tardy services I had this night sharply refused
reward, listened to him. They were sectaries, caring nothing for Islam
or Caliph or Turk, or Abd el Kadir: but an anti-Christian rising meant
plunder, and perhaps Maronites to kill. So they ran to arms, and began
to burst open shops.</p>
<p>We held our hands till day, for our numbers were not so great that we
could throw away our advantage in weapons, and fight in the dark which
made a fool and a man equal. But when dawn hinted itself we moved men to
the upper suburb, and drove the rioters towards the river districts of
the town’s centre, where the streets crossed bridges, and were easy to
control.</p>
<p>Then we saw how small the trouble was. Nuri Said had covered the
parades with machine-gun sections, who, in one long rattle of fire,
barraged them across to blank walls. Past these our sweeping parties
urged the dissident. The appalling noise made the Druses drop their
booty and flee down side alleys. Mohammed Said, not so brave as his
brother, was taken in his house, and gaoled in the Town Hall. Again I
itched to shoot him, but waited till we had the other.</p>
<p>However, Abd el Kader broke back into the country. At noon it was all
over. When things began I had called up Chauvel, who at once offered his
troops. I thanked him, and asked that a second company of horse be
drafted to the Turkish barracks (the nearest post) to stand by against
call: but the fighting was too petty for that call.</p>
<p>Its best consequence was among the pressmen in an hotel whose wall
was the stop-block of one barrage. They had not dipped their pens in
much blood during this campaign, which had run faster than their cars;
but here was a godsend at their bedroom windows, and they wrote and
telegraphed till Allenby, away in Ramleh, took fright, sending me a
Press despatch which recalled two Balkan wars and five Armenian
massacres, but never carnage like to-day’s: the streets paved with
corpses, the gutters running blood, and the swollen Barada spouting
crimson through all the fountains in the city! My reply was a
death-roll, naming the five victims, and the hurts of the ten wounded.
Of the casualties three fell to Kirkbride’s ruthless revolver.</p>
<p>The Druses were expelled from the city, and lost horses and rifles at
the hands of the citizens of Damascus, whom we had formed for the
emergency into civic guards. These gave the town a warlike look,
patrolling till afternoon, when things grew quiet again, and street
traffic normal; with sweetmeats, iced drinks, flowers, and little Hejaz
flags being hawked round by their pedlars as before.</p>
<p>We returned to the organization of the public services. An amusing
event for me, personally, was an official call from the Spanish Consul,
a polished English-speaking individual, who introduced himself as Chargé
d’Affaires for seventeen nationalities (including all combatants except
the Turks) and was in vain search of the constituted legal authority of
the town.</p>
<p>At lunch an Australian doctor implored me, for the sake of humanity,
to take notice of the Turkish hospital. I ran over in my mind our three
hospitals, the military, the civil, the missionary, and told him they
were cared for as well as our means allowed. The Arabs could not invent
drugs, nor could Chauvel give them to us. He enlarged further;
describing an enormous range of filthy buildings without a single
medical officer or orderly, packed with dead and dying; mainly dysentery
cases, but at least some typhoid; and, it was only to be hoped, no
typhus or cholera.</p>
<p>In his descriptions I recognized the Turkish barracks, occupied by
two Australian companies of town reserve. Were there sentries at the
gates? Yes, he said, that was the place, but it was full of Turkish
sick. I walked across and parleyed with the guard, who distrusted my
single appearance on foot. They had orders to keep out all natives lest
they massacre the patients — a misapprehension of the Arab fashion of
making war. At last my English speech got me past the little lodge whose
garden was filled with two hundred wretched prisoners in exhaustion and
despair.</p>
<p>Through the great door of the barrack I called, up the dusty echoing
corridors. No one answered. The huge, deserted, sun-trapping court was
squalid with rubbish. The guard told me that thousands of prisoners from
here had yesterday gone to a camp beyond the town. Since then no one had
come in or out. I walked over to the far thoroughfare, on whose left was
a shuttered lobby, black after the blazing sunlight of the plastered
court.</p>
<p>I stepped in, to meet a sickening stench: and, as my eyes grew open,
a sickening sight. The stone floor was covered with dead bodies, side by
side, some in full uniform, some in underclothing, some stark naked.
There might be thirty there, and they crept with rats, who had gnawed
wet red galleries into them. A few were corpses nearly fresh, perhaps
only a day or two old: others must have been there for long. Of some the
flesh, going putrid, was yellow and blue and black. Many were already
swollen twice or thrice life-width, their fat heads laughing with black
mouth across jaws harsh with stubble. Of others the softer parts were
fallen in. A few had burst open, and were liquescent with decay.</p>
<p>Beyond was the vista of a great room, from which I thought there came
a groan. I trod over to it, across the soft mat of bodies, whose
clothing, yellow with dung, crackled dryly under me. Inside the ward the
air was raw and still, and the dressed battalion of filled beds so quiet
that I thought these too were dead, each man rigid on his stinking
pallet, from which liquid muck had dripped down to stiffen on the
cemented floor.</p>
<p>I picked forward a little between their lines, holding my white
skirts about me, not to dip my bare feet in their puddled running: when
suddenly I heard a sigh and turned abruptly to meet the open beady eyes
of an outstretched man, while ‘Aman, Aman’ (pity, pity, pardon) rustled
from the twisted lips. There was a brown waver as several tried to lift
their hands, and a thin fluttering like withered leaves, as they vainly
fell back again upon their beds.</p>
<p>No one of them had strength to speak, but there was something which
made me laugh at their whispering in unison, as if by command. No doubt
occasion had been given them to rehearse their appeal all the last two
days, each time a curious trooper had peered into their halls and gone
away.</p>
<p>I ran through the arch into the garden, across which Australians were
picketed in lines, and asked them for a working-party. They refused.
Tools? They had none. Doctors? Busy. Kirkbride came; the Turkish
doctors, we heard, were upstairs. We broke open a door to find seven men
in night-gowns sitting on unmade beds in a great room, boiling toffee.
We convinced them quickly that it would be wise to sort out living and
dead, and prepare me, in half an hour, a tally of their numbers.
Kirkbride’s heavy frame and boots fitted him to oversee this work: while
I saw Ali Riza Pasha, and asked him to detail us one of the four Arab
army doctors.</p>
<p>When he came we pressed the fifty fittest prisoners in the lodge as
labour party. We bought biscuits and fed them: then armed them with
Turkish tools and set them in the backyard to dig a common grave. The
Australian officers protested it was an unfit place, the smell arising
from which might drive them from their garden. My jerky reply was that I
hoped to God it would.</p>
<p>It was cruelty to work men so tired and ill as our miserable Turks,
but haste gave us no choice. By the kicks and blows of their
victor-serving non-commissioned officers they were at last got obedient.
We began operations on a six-foot hole to one side of the garden. This
hole we tried to deepen, but beneath was a cement floor; so I said it
would do if they enlarged the edges. Near by was much quicklime, which
would cover the bodies effectually.</p>
<p>The doctors told us of fifty-six dead, two hundred dying, seven
hundred not dangerously ill. We formed a stretcher party to carry down
the corpses, of which some were lifted easily, others had to be scraped
up piecemeal with shovels. The bearers were hardly strong enough to
stand at their work: indeed, before the end, we had added the bodies of
two to the heap of dead men in the pit.</p>
<p>The trench was small for them, but so fluid was the mass that each
newcomer, when tipped in, fell softly, just jellying out the edges of
the pile a little with his weight. Before the work finished it was
midnight, and I dismissed myself to bed, exhausted, since I had not
slept three hours since we left Deraa four days ago. Kirkbride (a boy in
years, doing two men’s work these days) stayed to finish the burying,
and scatter earth and lime over the grave.</p>
<p>At the hotel waited a bunch of urgent matters: some death sentences,
a new justiciary, a famine in barley for the morrow if the train did not
work. Also a complaint from Chauvel that some of the Arab troops had
been slack about saluting Australian officers!</p>
