<h4 id="chapter-lxxxviii">CHAPTER LXXXVIII</h4>
<p>LAZY nights, three of them, in the armoured car tents at Guweira were
pleasant, with Alan Dawnay, Joyce, and others talking, and Tafileh to
boast about. Yet these friends were a little grieved at my luck, for
their great expedition with Feisal a fortnight ago to overwhelm
Mudowwara had turned out unprofitably. Partly it was the ancient problem
of the co-operation of regulars with irregulars; partly it was the fault
of old Mohammed Ali el Beidawi, who, put over the Beni Atiyeh, had come
with them to water, cried, ‘Noon-halt!’ and sat there for two months,
pandering to that hedonistic streak among the Arabs which made them
helpless slaves of carnal indulgence. In Arabia, where superfluities
lacked, the temptation of necessary food lay always on men. Each morsel
which passed their lips might, if they were not watchful, become a
pleasure. Luxuries might be as plain as running water or a shady tree,
whose rareness and misuse often turned them into lusts. Their story
reminded me of Apollonius’ ‘Come off it, you men of Tarsus, sitting on
your river like geese, drunken with its white water!’</p>
<p>Then thirty thousand pounds in gold came up from Akaba for me and my
cream camel, Wodheiha, the best of my remaining stud. She was
Ateiba-bred and had won many races for her old owner: also, she was in
splendid condition, fat but not too fat, her pads hardened by much
practice over the northern flints, and her coat thick and matted. She
was not tall, and looked heavy, but was docile and smooth to ride,
turning left or right if the saddle-horn were tapped on the required
side. So I rode her without a stick, comfortably reading a book when the
march permitted.</p>
<p>As my proper men were at Tafileh or Azrak, or out on mission, I asked
Feisal for temporary followers. He lent me his two Ateiba horsemen, Serj
and Rameid; and, to help carry my gold, added to the party Sheikh
Motlog, whose worth we had discovered when our armoured cars explored
the plains below Mudowwara for Tebuk.</p>
<p>Motlog had gone as sponsor, pointing out the country from a perch
high on the piled baggage of a box-Ford. They were dashing in and out of
sand-hills at speed, the Fords swaying like launches in a swell. At one
bad bend they skidded half-round on two wheels crazily. Motlog was
tossed out on his head. Marshall stopped the car and ran back contrite,
with ready excuses for the driving; but the Sheikh, ruefully rubbing his
head, said gently ‘Don’t be angry with me. I have not learnt to ride
these things’.</p>
<p>The gold was in thousand-pound bags. I gave two bags each to fourteen
of Motlog’s twenty men, and took the last two myself. A bag weighed
twenty-two pounds, and in the awful road-conditions two were weight
enough for a camel, and swung fairly on either side in the saddle-bags.
We started at noon, hoping to make a good first stage before getting
into the trouble of the hills: but unfortunately it turned wet after
half an hour, and a steady rain soaked us through and through, and made
our camels’ hair curl like a wet dog’s.</p>
<p>Motlog at that precise stage saw a tent, Sherif Fahad’s, in the
corner of a sandstone pike. Despite my urging, he voted to spend the
night there, and see what it looked like on the hills to-morrow. I knew
this would be a fatal course, wasting days in indecision: so I said
farewell to him and rode on with my two men, and with six Shobek-bound
Howeitat, who had joined our caravan.</p>
<p>The argument had delayed us, and consequently we only reached the
foot of the pass at dark. By the sad, soft rain we were made rather
sorry for our virtue; inclined to envy Motlog his hospitality with
Fahad, when suddenly a red spark to our left drew us across to find
Saleh ibn Shefia camped there in a tent and three caves, with a hundred
of his freed-men fighters from Yenbo. Saleh, the son of poor old
Mohammed, our jester, was the proper lad who had carried Wejh by assault
on Vickery’s field-day.</p>
<p>‘Cheyf ent?’ (‘How are you?’) said I earnestly twice or thrice. His
eyes sparkled at the Juheina manner. He came near me and with bowed head
and intense voice poured out a string of twenty ‘Chey fents’ before
drawing breath. I disliked being outdone, so replied with a dozen as
solemnly. He took me up with another of his long bursts, many more than
twenty this time. So I gave up trying to learn how many are the possible
repetitions of salutations in Wadi Yenbo.</p>
<p>He welcomed me, in spite of my drenched condition, to his own carpet
in his tent and gave me a new garment of his mother’s sewing, while
waiting for the hot stew of meat and rice. Then we lay down and slept a
full night of great satisfaction, hearing the patter of rain on the
double canvas of his Meccan tent.</p>
<p>In the morning we were off at dawn, munching a handful of Saleh’s
bread. As we set foot on the ascent, Serj looked up and said, ‘The
mountain wears his skull-cap’. There was a white dome of snow on every
crest; and the Ateiba pushed quickly and curiously up the pass to feel
this new wonder with their hands. The camels, too, were ignorant, and
stretched their slow necks down to sniff its whiteness twice or thrice
in tired inquiry; but then drew their heads away and looked forward
without life-interest, once more.</p>
<p>Our inactivity lasted only another moment; for, as we put our heads
over the last ridge, a wind from the north-east took us in the teeth,
with a cold so swift and biting that we gasped for breath and turned
hurriedly back into shelter. It seemed as if it would be fatal to face
it; but that we knew was silly: so we pulled ourselves together and rode
hard through its first extreme to the half-shelter of the valley. Serj
and Rameid, terrified by these new pains in their lungs, thought they
were strangling; and to spare them the mental struggle of passing a
friendly camp, I led our little party aside behind Maulud’s hill, so
that we saw nothing of his weather-beaten force.</p>
<p>These men of Maulud’s had been camped in this place, four thousand
feet above the sea, for two months without relief. They had to live in
shallow dug-outs on the hill-side. They had no fuel except the sparse,
wet wormwood, over which they were just able to bake their necessary
bread every other day. They had no clothes but khaki drill uniform of
the British summer sort. They slept in their rain-sodden verminous pits
on empty or half-empty flour sacks, six or eight of them together in a
knotted bunch, that enough of the worn blankets might be pooled for
warmth.</p>
<p>Rather more than half of them died or were injured by the cold and
wet; yet the others maintained their watch, exchanging shots daily with
the Turkish outposts, and protected only by the inclement weather from
crushing counter-attack. We owed much to them, and more to Maulud, whose
fortitude stiffened them in their duty.</p>
<p>The old scarred warriors history in the Turkish army was a catalogue
of affairs provoked by his sturdy sense of Arab honour and nationality,
a creed for which three or four times he had sacrificed his prospects.
It must have been a strong creed which enabled him to endure cheerfully
three winter months in front of Maan and to share out enough spirit
among five hundred ordinary men to keep them stout-heartedly about
him.</p>
<p>We, for our one day, had a fill of hardship. Just on the ridge about
Aba el Lissan the ground was crusted with frost, and only the smart of
the wind in our eyes hindered us: but then our troubles began. The
camels came to a standstill in the slush at the bottom of a twenty-foot
bank of slippery mud, and lowed at it helplessly, as if to say that they
could not carry us up that. We jumped off to help them, and slid back
ourselves just as badly. At last we took off our new, cherished boots,
donned to armour us against the winter; and hauled the camels up the
glacis barefoot, as on the journey down.</p>
<p>That was the end of our comfort, and we must have been off twenty
times before sunset. Some of the dismounts were involuntary, when our
camels side-slipped under us, and came down with the jingle of coin
ringing through the hollow rumble of their cask-like bellies. While they
were strong this falling made them as angry as she-camels could be:
afterwards they grew plaintive, and finally afraid. We also grew short
with one another, for the foul wind gave us no rest. Nothing in Arabia
could be more cutting than a north wind at Maan, and to-day’s was of the
sharpest and strongest. It blew through our clothes as if we had none,
fixed our fingers in claws not able to hold either halter or
riding-stick, and cramped our legs so that we had no grip of the
saddle-pin. Consequently, when thrown from our falling beasts we pitched
off, to crash stiffly on the ground, still frozen-brittle in the
cross-legged attitude of riding.</p>
<p>However, there was no rain, and the wind felt like a drying one, so
we held on steadily to the north. By evening we had almost made the
rivulet of Basta. This meant that we were travelling more than a mile an
hour; and for fear lest on the morrow we and our camels would both be
too tired to do so well, I pushed on in the dark across the little
stream. It was swollen, and the beasts jibbed at it, so that we had to
lead the way on foot, through three feet of chilly water.</p>
<p>Over the high ground, beyond, the wind buffeted us like an enemy: at
about nine o’clock the others flung themselves crying down on the ground
and refused to go further. I, too, was very near crying; sustained,
indeed, only by my annoyance with their open lamentations; and therefore
reluctantly glad at heart to yield to their example. We built up the
nine camels in a phalanx, and lay between them in fair comfort,
listening to the driving wrack clashing about us as loud as the surges
by night round a ship at sea. The visible stars were brilliant, seeming
to change groups and places waywardly between the clouds which scudded
over our heads. We had each two army blankets, and a packet of cooked
bread; so we were armed against evil and could sleep securely in the mud
and cold.</p>
