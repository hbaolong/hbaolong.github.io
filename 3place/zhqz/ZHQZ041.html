<h4 id="chapter">CHAPTER</h4>
<p>XXXFAKHRI Pasha was still playing our game. He held an entrenched
line around Medina, just far enough to make it impossible for the Arabs
to shell the city. (Such an attempt was never made or imagined.) The
other troops were being distributed along the railway, in strong
garrisons at all water stations between Medina and Tebuk, and in smaller
posts between these garrisons, so that daily patrols might guarantee the
track. In short, he had fallen back on as stupid a defensive as could be
conceived. Garland had gone south-east from Wejh, and Newcombe
north-east, to pick holes in it with high explosives. They would cut
rails and bridges, and place automatic mines for running trains.</p>
<p>The Arabs had passed from doubt to violent optimism, and were
promising exemplary service. Feisal enrolled most of the Billi, and the
Moahib, which made him master of Arabia between the railway and the sea.
He then sent the Juheina to Abdulla in Wadi Ais.</p>
<p>He could now prepare to deal solemnly with the Hejaz Railway; but
with a practice better than my principles, I begged him first to delay
in Wejh and set marching an intense movement among the tribes beyond us,
that in the future our revolt might be extended, and the railway
threatened from Tebuk (our present limit of influence) northward as far
as Maan. My vision of the course of the Arab war was still purblind. I
had not seen that the preaching was victory and the fighting a delusion.
For the moment, I roped them together, and, as Feisal fortunately liked
changing men’s minds rather than breaking railways, the preaching went
the better.</p>
<p>With his northern neighbours, the coastal Howeitat, he had already
made a beginning: but we now sent to the Beni Atiyeh, a stronger people
to the north-east; and gained a great step when the chief, Asi ibn
Atiyeh, came in and swore allegiance. His main motive was jealousy of
his brothers, so that we did not expect from him active help; but the
bread and salt with him gave us freedom of movement across his tribe’s
territory. Beyond lay various tribes owning obedience to Nuri Shaalan,
the great Emir of the Ruwalla, who, after the Sherif and ibn Saud and
ibn Rashid, was the fourth figure among the precarious princes of the
desert.</p>
<p>Nuri was an old man, who had ruled his Anazeh tribesmen for thirty
years. His was the chief family of the Rualla, but Nuri had no
precedence among them at birth, nor was he loved, nor a great man of
battle. His leadership had been acquired by sheer force of character. To
gain it he had killed two of his brothers. Later he had added Sherarat
and others to the number of his followers, and in all their desert his
word was absolute law. He had none of the wheedling diplomacy of the
ordinary sheikh; a word, and there was an end of opposition, or of his
opponent. All feared and obeyed him; to use his roads we must have his
countenance.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this was easy. Feisal had secured it years ago, and had
retained it by interchange of gifts from Medina and Yenbo. Now, from
Wejh, Fais el Ghusein went up to him and on the way crossed ibn Dughmi,
one of the chief men of the Ruwalla, coming down to us with the
desirable gift of some hundreds of good baggage camels. Nuri, of course,
still kept friendly with the Turks. Damascus and Bagdad were his
markets, and they could have half-starved his tribe in three months, had
they suspected him; but we knew that when the moment came we should have
his armed help, and till then anything short of a breach with
Turkey.</p>
<p>His favour would open to us the Sirhan, a famous roadway, camping
ground, and chain of water-holes, which in a series of linked
depressions extended from Jauf, Nuri’s capital, in the south-east,
northwards to Azrak, near Jebel Druse, in Syria. It was the freedom of
the Sirhan we needed to reach the tents of the Eastern Howeitat, those
famous abu Tayi, of whom Auda, the greatest fighting man in northern
Arabia, was chief. Only by means of Auda abu Tayi could we swing the
tribes from Maan to Akaba so violently in our favour that they would
help us take Akaba and its hills from their Turkish garrisons: only with
his active support could we venture to thrust out from Wejh on the long
trek to Maan. Since our Yenbo days we had been longing for him and
trying to win him to our cause.</p>
<p>We made a great step forward at Wejh; ibn Zaal, his cousin and a
war-leader of the abu Tayi, arrived on the seventeenth of February,
which was in all respects a fortunate day. At dawn there came in five
chief men of the Sherarat from the desert east of Tebuk, bringing a
present of eggs of the Arabian ostrich, plentiful in their
little-frequented desert. After them, the slaves showed in Dhaif-Allah,
abu Tiyur, a cousin of Hamd ibn Jazi, paramount of the central Howeitat
of the Maan plateau. These were numerous and powerful; splendid
fighters; but blood enemies of their cousins, the nomad abu Tayi,
because of an old-grounded quarrel between Auda and Hamd. We were proud
to see them coming thus far to greet us, yet not content, for they were
less fit than the abu Tayi for our purposed attack against Akaba.</p>
<p>On their heels came a cousin of Nawwaf, Nuri Shaalan’s eldest son,
with a mare sent by Nawwaf to Feisal. The Shaalan and the Jazi, being
hostile, hardened eyes at one another; so we divided the parties and
improvised a new guest-camp. After the Rualla, was announced the abu
Tageiga chief of the sedentary Howeitat of the coast. He brought his
tribe’s respectful homage and the spoils of Dhaba and Moweilleh, the two
last Turkish outlets on the Red Sea. Room was made for him on Feisal’s
carpet, and the warmest thanks rendered him for his tribe’s activity;
which carried us to the borders of Akaba, by tracks too rough for
operations of force, but convenient for preaching and still more so for
getting news.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, ibn Zaal arrived, with ten other of Auda’s chief
followers. He kissed Feisal’s hand once for Auda and then once for
himself, and, sitting back, declared that he came from Auda to present
his salutations and to ask for orders. Feisal, with policy, controlled
his outward joy, and introduced him gravely to his blood enemies, the
Jazi Howeitat. Ibn Zaal acknowledged them distantly. Later, we held
great private conversations with him and dismissed him with rich gifts,
richer promises, and Feisal’s own message to Auda that his mind would
not be smooth till he had seen him face to face in Wejh. Auda was an
immense chivalrous name, but an unknown quantity to us, and in so vital
a matter as Akaba we could not afford a mistake. He must come down that
we might weigh him, and frame our future plans actually in his presence,
and with his help.</p>
<p>Except that all its events were happy, this day was not essentially
unlike Feisal’s every day. The rush of news made my diary fat. The roads
to Wejh swarmed with envoys and volunteers and great sheikhs riding in
to swear allegiance. The contagion of their constant passage made the
lukewarm Billi ever more profitable to us. Feisal swore new adherents
solemnly on the Koran between his hands, ‘to wait while he waited, march
when he marched, to yield obedience to no Turk, to deal kindly with all
who spoke Arabic (whether Bagdadi, Aleppine, Syrian, or pure-blooded)
and to put independence above life, family, and goods’.</p>
<p>He also began to confront them at once, in his presence, with their
tribal enemies, and to compose their feuds. An account of profit and
loss would be struck between the parties, with Feisal modulating and
interceding between them, and often paying the balance, or contributing
towards it from his own funds, to hurry on the pact. During two years
Feisal so laboured daily, putting together and arranging in their
natural order the innumerable tiny pieces which made up Arabian society,
and combining them into his one design of war against the Turks. There
was no blood feud left active in any of the districts through which he
had passed, and he was Court of Appeal, ultimate and unchallenged, for
western Arabia.</p>
<p>He showed himself worthy of this achievement. He never gave a partial
decision, nor a decision so impracticably just that it must lead to
disorder. No Arab ever impugned his judgements, or questioned his wisdom
and competence in tribal business. By patiently sifting out right and
wrong, by his tact, his wonderful memory, he gained authority over the
nomads from Medina to Damascus and beyond. He was recognized as a force
transcending tribe, superseding blood chiefs, greater than jealousies.
The Arab movement became in the best sense national, since within it all
Arabs were at one, and for it private interests must be set aside; and
in this movement chief place, by right of application and by right of
ability, had been properly earned by the man who filled it for those few
weeks of triumph and longer months of disillusion after Damascus had
been set free.</p>
