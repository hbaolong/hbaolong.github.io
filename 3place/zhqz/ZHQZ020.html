<h4 id="chapter-i">CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>XJEDDAH had pleased us, on our way to the Consulate: so after lunch,
when it was a little cooler, or at least when the sun was not so high,
we wandered out to see the sights under the guidance of Young, Wilson’s
assistant, a man who found good in many old things, but little good in
things now being made.</p>
<p>It was indeed a remarkable town. The streets were alleys, wood roofed
in the main bazaar, but elsewhere open to the sky in the little gap
between the tops of the lofty white-walled houses. These were built four
or five stories high, of coral rag tied with square beams and decorated
by wide bow-windows running from ground to roof in grey wooden panels.
There was no glass in Jidda, but a profusion of good lattices, and some
very delicate shallow chiselling on the panels of window casings. The
doors were heavy two-leaved slabs of teak-wood, deeply carved, often
with wickets in them; and they had rich hinges and ring-knockers of
hammered iron. There was much moulded or cut plastering, and on the
older houses fine stone heads and jambs to the windows looking on the
inner courts.</p>
<p>The work of architecture was like crazy Elizabethan half-timber work,
in the elaborate Cheshire fashion, but gone gimcrack to an incredible
degree. House-fronts were fretted, pierced and pargetted till they
looked as though cut out of cardboard for a romantic stage-setting.
Every storey jutted, every window leaned one way or other; often the
very walls sloped. It was like a dead city, so clean underfoot, and so
quiet. Its winding, even streets were floored with damp sand solidified
by time and as silent to the tread as any carpet. The lattices and
wall-returns deadened all reverberation of voice. There were no carts,
nor any streets wide enough for carts, no shod animals, no bustle
anywhere. Everything was hushed, strained, even furtive. The doors of
houses shut softly as we passed. There were no loud dogs, no crying
children: indeed, except in the bazaar, still half asleep, there were
few wayfarers of any kind; and the rare people we did meet, all thin,
and as it were wasted by disease, with scarred, hairless faces and
screwed-up eyes, slipped past us quickly and cautiously, not looking at
us. Their skimp, white robes, shaven polls with little skull-caps, red
cotton shoulder-shawls, and bare feet were so same as to be almost a
uniform.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was oppressive, deadly. There seemed no life in it. It
was not burning hot, but held a moisture and sense of great age and
exhaustion such as seemed to belong to no other place: not a passion of
smells like Smyrna, Naples or Marseilles, but a feeling of long use, of
the exhalations of many people, of continued bath-heat and sweat. One
would say that for years Jidda had not been swept through by a firm
breeze: that its streets kept their air from year’s end to year’s end,
from the day they were built for so long as the houses should endure.
There was nothing in the bazaars to buy.</p>
<p>In the evening the telephone rang; and the Sherif called Storrs to
the instrument. He asked if we would not like to listen to his band.
Storrs, in astonishment, asked What band? and congratulated his holiness
on having advanced so far towards urbanity. The Sherif explained that
the headquarters of the Hejaz Command under the Turks had had a brass
band, which played each night to the Governor General; and when the
Governor General was captured by Abdulla at Taif his band was captured
with him. The other prisoners were sent to Egypt for internment; but the
band was excepted. It was held in Mecca to give music to the victors.
Sherif Hussein laid his receiver on the table of his reception hall, and
we, called solemnly one by one to the telephone, heard the band in the
Palace at Mecca forty-five miles away. Storrs expressed the general
gratification; and the Sherif, increasing his bounty replied that the
band should be sent down by forced march to Jidda, to play in our
courtyard also. ‘And,’ said he, ‘you may then do me the pleasure of
ringing me up from your end, that I may share your satisfaction.’</p>
<p>Next day Storrs visited Abdulla in his tent out by Eve’s Tomb; and
together they inspected the hospital, the barracks, the town offices,
and partook of the hospitality of the Mayor and the Governor. In the
intervals of duty they talked about money, and the Sherif’s title, and
his relations with the other Princes of Arabia, and the general course
of the war: all the commonplaces that should pass between envoys of two
Governments. It was tedious, and for the most part I held myself
excused, as after a conversation in the morning I had made up my mind
that Abdulla was not the necessary leader. We had asked him to sketch
the genesis of the Arab movement: and his reply illuminated his
character. He had begun by a long description of Talaat, the first Turk
to speak to him with concern of the restlessness of Hejaz. He wanted it
properly subdued, and military service, as elsewhere in the Empire,
introduced.</p>
<p>Abdulla, to forestall him, had made a plan of peaceful insurrection
for Hejaz, and, after sounding Kitchener without profit, had dated it
provisionally for 1915. He had meant to call out the tribes during the
feast, and lay hold of the pilgrims. They would have included many of
the chief men of Turkey besides leading Moslems of Egypt, India, Java,
Eritrea, and Algiers. With these thousands of hostages in his hands he
had expected to win the notice of the Great Powers concerned. He thought
they would bring pressure on the Porte to secure the release of their
nationals. The Porte, powerless to deal with Hejaz militarily, would
either have made concessions to the Sherif or have confessed its
powerlessness to the foreign States. In the latter event, Abdulla would
have approached them direct, ready to meet their demands in return for a
guarantee of immunity from Turkey. I did not like his scheme, and was
glad when he said with almost a sneer that Feisal in fear had begged his
father not to follow it. This sounded good for Feisal, towards whom my
hopes of a great leader were now slowly turning.</p>
<p>In the evening Abdulla came to dine with Colonel Wilson. We received
him in the courtyard on the house steps. Behind him were his brilliant
household servants and slaves, and behind them a pale crew of bearded,
emaciated men with woe-begone faces, wearing tatters of military
uniform, and carrying tarnished brass instruments of music. Abdulla
waved his hand towards them and crowed with delight, ‘My Band’. We sat
them on benches in the forecourt, and Wilson sent them cigarettes, while
we went up to the dining room, where the shuttered balcony was opened
right out, hungrily, for a sea breeze. As we sat down, the band, under
the guns and swords of Abdulla’s retainers, began, each instrument
apart, to play heartbroken Turkish airs. Our ears ached with noise; but
Abdulla beamed.</p>
<p>Curious the party was. Abdulla himself, Vice-President in partibus of
the Turkish Chamber and now Foreign Minister of the rebel Arab State;
Wilson, Governor of the Red Sea Province of the Sudan, and His Majesty’s
Minister with the Sherif of Mecca; Storrs, Oriental Secretary
successively to Gorst, Kitchener and McMahon in Cairo; Young, Cochrane,
and myself, hangers-on of the staff; Sayed Ali, a general in the
Egyptian Army, commander of the detachment sent over by the Sirdar to
help the first efforts of the Arabs; Aziz el Masri, now Chief of Staff
of the Arab regular army, but in old days Enver’s rival, leader of the
Turkish and Senussi forces against the Italians, chief conspirator of
the Arab officers in the Turkish army against the Committee of Union and
Progress, a man condemned to death by the Turks for obeying the Treaty
of Lausanne, and saved by The Times and Lord Kitchener.</p>
<p>We got tired of Turkish music, and asked for German. Aziz stepped out
on the balcony and called down to the bandsmen in Turkish to play us
something foreign. They struck shakily into ‘Deutschland über Alles’
just as the Sherif came to his telephone in Mecca to listen to the music
of our feast. We asked for more German music; and they played ‘Eine
feste Burg’. Then in the midst they died away into flabby discords of
drums. The parchment had stretched in the damp air of Jidda. They cried
for fire; and Wilson’s servants and Abdulla’s bodyguard brought them
piles of straw and packing cases. They warmed the drums, turning them
round and round before the blaze, and then broke into what they said was
the Hymn of Hate, though no one could recognize a European progression
in it all. Sayed Ali turned to Abdulla and said, ‘It is a death march’.
Abdulla’s eyes widened; but Storrs who spoke in quickly to the rescue
turned the moment to laughter; and we sent out rewards with the leavings
of the feast to the sorrowful musicians, who could take no pleasure in
our praises, but begged to be sent home. Next morning I left Jidda by
ship for Rabegh.</p>
