<h4 id="chapter-cxv">CHAPTER CXV</h4>
<p>NURI’S operation of to-day was the Turks’ final blow, after which
they gave up trying to restore the line between Amman and Deraa. We did
not know this, but still had its bogy set over us, and were urgent to
put out of action a yet longer stretch. Accordingly, next dawn,
Winterton, Jemil and I went out on cars to examine the line south of
Mafrak station. We were received with machine-gun fire of a vigour,
direction and intensity beyond any of our experience. Later we captured
the experts and found they were a German machine-gun unit. For the
moment we drew out, puzzled, and went further to a tempting bridge. My
plan was to run under it in the car till the vault enabled us to lay the
charge against the pier in shelter. So I transferred myself to an
armoured car, put sixty pounds of gun-cotton on the back-board, and told
the driver to push in under the arch.</p>
<p>Winterton and Jemil came behind in the supporting car. ‘It’s very
hot’, groaned Jemil. ‘It’s going to be still hotter where we’re going’,
replied Winterton, as we drew in slowly over indifferent ground with
aimless shells falling about. We were picking our way forward, about
fifty yards from the bank, with enough machine-gun bullets for a week’s
fighting rattling off our armour, when someone from behind the line
bowled a hand grenade at us.</p>
<p>This new condition made impossible my plan of getting under the
bridge. For one thing, a hit on the back of the car would have set off
our gun-cotton and blown us to blazes; for another, the car was helpless
against a lobbed grenade. So we drew off, perplexed to understand this
defence lavished on a bit of railway, and much interested, indeed
amused, at worthy opposition after so long ease. In our imaginations,
Check was a short, compact, furious man, darting glances every way from
beneath tangled eyebrows, for an end to his troubles; beside him Victory
seemed a lanky, white-skinned, rather languid woman. We must try again
after dark. At Um el Surab we found that Nasir wished to fix camp once
more at Umtaiye. It was a first stage of our journey to Damascus, so his
wish delighted me, and we moved; winning thereby good excuse for doing
nothing this night to the line. Instead, we sat and told stories of
experience and waited for midnight, when the Handley-Page was to bomb
Mafrak station. It came, and hundred-pound bomb after hundred-pound bomb
crashed into the packed sidings till they caught fire, and the Turks’
shooting stopped.</p>
<p>We slept, having given prize of the night to a tale of Enver Pasha,
after the Turks re-took Sharkeui. He went to see it, in a penny steamer,
with Prince Jemil and a gorgeous staff. The Bulgars, when they came, had
massacred the Turks; as they retired the Bulgar peasants went too. So
the Turks found hardly any one to kill. A greybeard was led on board for
the Commander-in-Chief to bait. At last Enver tired of this. He signed
to two of his bravo aides, and throwing open the furnace door, said,
‘Push him in.’ The old man screamed, but the officers were stronger and
the door was slammed-to on his jerking body. ‘We turned, feeling sick,
to go away, but Enver, his head on one side, listening, halted us. So we
listened, till there came a crash within the furnace. He smiled and
nodded, saying, “Their heads always pop, like that”.’</p>
<p>All night, and next day, the fire among the trucks burned greater and
greater. It was proof of the breakdown of the Turks, which the Arabs had
been rumouring since yesterday. They said the Fourth Army was streaming
up from Amman in a loose mob. The Beni Hassan, who were cutting off
stragglers and weak detachments, compared them to gipsies on the
march.</p>
<p>We held a council. Our work against the Fourth Army was finished.
Such remnants as avoided out of the hands of the Arabs would reach Deraa
as unarmed stragglers. Our new endeavour should be to force the quick
evacuation of Deraa, in order to prevent the Turks there reforming the
fugitives into a rearguard. So I proposed that we march north, past Tell
Arar, and over the railway at dawn to-morrow, into Sheikh Saad village.
It lay in familiar country with abundant water, perfect observation, and
a secure retreat west or north, or even south-west, if we were directly
attacked. It cut off Deraa from Damascus and Mezerib also.</p>
<p>Tallal seconded me with fervour. Nuri Shaalan gave his nod: Nasir and
Nuri Said. So we prepared to strike camp. The armoured cars could not
come with us. They had better stay in Azrak, till Deraa fell and we
wanted them to help us into Damascus. The Bristol Fighters, likewise,
had done their work, clearing the air of Turkish aeroplanes. They might
return to Palestine with news of our move to Sheikh Saad.</p>
<p>Off they circled. We, watching their line of flight, noticed a great
cloud of dust added to the slow smoke from ruined Mafrak. One machine
turned back and dropped a scribble that a large body of hostile cavalry
were heading out from the railway towards us.</p>
<p>This was unwelcome news, for we were not in trim for a fight. The
cars had gone, the aeroplanes had gone, one company of the mounted
infantry had marched, Pisani’s mules were packed and drawn up in column.
I went off to Nuri Said, standing with Nasir on an ash heap at the head
of the hill, and we wavered whether to run or stand. At last it seemed
wiser to run, since Sheikh Saad was a more profitable stop-block. So we
hurried the regulars away.</p>
<p>Yet things could hardly be left like that. Accordingly Nuri Shaalan
and Tallal led the Rualla horse and the Hauran horse back to delay the
pursuit. They had an unexpected ally, for our cars, on their way to
Azrak, had seen the enemy. After all, the Turks were not cavalry coming
to attack us, but deluded elements seeking a shorter way home. We took
some hundreds of thirsty prisoners and much transport; causing such
panic that the main rout in the plain cut the traces of their limbers
and rode off on the bare horses. The infection of terror spread down the
line, and troops miles from any Arab interference threw away all they
had, even to their rifles, and made a mad rush towards supposed safety
in Deraa.</p>
<p>However, this interruption delayed us; for we could hardly march a
khaki-clad body of regular camel corps across Hauran at night without
enough local cavalry to go bail to the suspicious villagers that we were
not Turks. So late in the afternoon we halted for Tallal and Nasir and
Nuri Shaalan to catch up.</p>
<p>This halt gave some people time to review the proceedings, and new
questions arose as to the wisdom of crossing the railway again, to put
ourselves in the dangerous position of Sheikh Saad, astride the retreat
of the main Turkish forces. Finally, near midnight, Sabin appeared where
I lay awake in the midst of the army on my carpet. He suggested that we
had done enough. Allenby had appointed us watchmen of the Fourth Army.
We had just seen its disordered flight. Our duty was completed; and we
might honourably fall back to Bosra, twenty miles out of the way to the
east, where the Druses were collecting under Nesib el Bekri to help us.
We might wait with them for the British to take Deraa, and for our
reward, in the victorious close of the campaign.</p>
<p>This attitude passed me by, since, if we withdrew to Jebel Druse, we
ended our active service before the game was won, leaving the last brunt
on Allenby. I was very jealous for the Arab honour, in whose service I
would go forward at all costs. They had joined the war to win freedom,
and the recovery of their old capital by force of their own arms was the
sign they would best understand.</p>
<p>‘Duty’, like people who praised it, was a poor thing. Evidently, by
thrusting behind Deraa into Sheikh Saad we put more pressure on the
Turks than any British unit was in place to put. It would forbid the
Turks fighting again this side of Damascus; for which gain our few lives
would be cheap payment. Damascus meant the end of this war in the East,
and, I believed, the end of the general war, too; because the Central
Powers being inter-dependent, the breaking of their weakest link —
Turkey — would swing the whole cluster loose. Therefore, for every
sensible reason, strategical, tactical, political, even moral, we were
going on.</p>
<p>Sabin’s stubborn resistant mind was not to be convinced. He returned
with Pisani and Winterton, and began to debate; speaking slowly because
Nuri Said was lying on the next rug only half asleep, and he wanted to
include him in the conference.</p>
<p>Accordingly he stressed the military aspect: our fulfilled purpose
and the danger of the Hejaz Railway. This delay made us too late to
cross to-night. To-morrow it would be madness to attempt the operation.
The line would be guarded from end to end by tens of thousands of Turks
pouring out of Deraa. If they let us over we would only be in still
greater danger. Joyce, he said, had appointed him military adviser to
the expedition; and it was his duty to point out, reluctantly, that as a
regular officer he knew his business.</p>
<p>Had I been a regular officer I might have found Sabin’s upsetting the
others irregular. As it was I endured his complaints, patiently sighing
whenever I thought it would irritate the protestant. At the end
wanderingly I said I wanted to sleep, since we would have to be up early
to cross the line, and it was my intention to go in front with my
bodyguard among the Beduin, wherever they were, for it was odd that Nuri
Shaalan and Tallal had not overtaken us. Anyway, I was going to sleep
now.</p>
<p>Pisani, whose long military life had been all as subordinate, said
with correctness that he took his orders and would follow. I liked him
for that, and tried to soothe his honest doubts by reminding him that we
had worked for eighteen months together without his ever finding cause
to call me rash. He replied with a French laugh that he thought it all
very rash, but was a soldier.</p>
<p>Winterton’s instinct joined him to the weaker and more sporting side
in any choice but fox-hunting. Nuri Said had lain silently through our
talk, pretending to be asleep; but, when Sabin went away, he rolled over
whispering, ‘Is it true?’ I replied that I saw no unusual risk in
crossing the line in mid-afternoon, and with care we should avoid traps
at Sheikh Saad. He lay back satisfied.</p>
