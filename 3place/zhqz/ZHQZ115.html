<h4 id="chapter-civ">CHAPTER CIV</h4>
<p>I HAD reached this useful stage when there was a disturbance from the
Toweiha tents. Shouting men ran towards me. I pulled myself together to
appease a fight between the Arabs and the Camel Corps, but instead it
was an appeal for help against a Shammar raid two hours since, away by
the Snainirat. Eighty camels had been driven off. Not to seem wholly
ungracious, I put on our spare camels the four or five of my men whose
friends or relatives had suffered, and sent them off.</p>
<p>Buxton and his men started in the mid-afternoon while I delayed till
evening, seeing my men load our six thousand pounds of gun-cotton on the
thirty Egyptian pack-camels. My disgusted bodyguard were for this ride
to lead or drive the explosives’ train.</p>
<p>We had judged that Buxton would sleep just short of the Hadi, so we
rode thither: but saw no camp-fire, nor was the track trodden. We looked
over the crest of the ridge, into a bitter north wind coming off Hermon
into our flustered faces. The slopes beyond were black and silent, and
to us town-dwellers, accustomed to the reek of smoke, or sweat, or the
ferment of soil freshly dug, there was something searching, disquieting,
almost dangerous, in the steely desert wind. So we turned back a few
paces, and hid under the lip of the ridge to sleep comfortably in its
cloistered air.</p>
<p>In the morning we looked out across fifty miles of blank country, and
wondered at this missing our companions: but Daher shouted suddenly from
the Hadi side, seeing their column winding up from the south-east. They
had early lost the track and camped till dawn. My men jested with humour
against Sheikh Saleh, their guide, as one who could lose his road
between the Thlaithukhwat and Bair: just like one might say between the
Marble Arch and Oxford Circus.</p>
<p>However, it was a perfect morning, with the sun hot on our backs, and
the wind fresh in our faces. The Camel Corps strode splendidly past the
frosted tips of the three peaks into the green depths of Dhirwa. They
looked different from the stiff, respectful companies which had reached
Akaba, for Buxton’s supple brain and friendly observation had taken in
the experience of irregular fighting, and revised their training rules
for the new needs.</p>
<p>He had changed their column formation, breaking its formal
subdivision of two hard companies: he had changed the order of march, so
that, instead of their old immaculate lines, they came clotted, in
groups which split up or drew together without delay upon each variation
of road or ground surface. He had reduced the loads and rehung them,
thereby lengthening the camels’ pace and daily mileage. He had cut into
their infantry system of clockwork halts every so often (to let the
camels stale!) and grooming was less honoured. In the old days, they had
prinked their animals, cosseting them like Pekinese, and each halt had
been lightened by a noisy flapping massage of the beasts’ stripped humps
with the saddle-blanket; whereas now the spare time was spent in
grazing.</p>
<p>Consequently, our Imperial Camel Corps had become rapid, elastic,
enduring, silent; except when they mounted by numbers, for then the
three hundred he-camels would roar in concert, giving out a wave of
sound audible miles across the night. Each march saw them more
workmanlike, more at home on the animals, tougher, leaner, faster. They
behaved like boys on holiday, and the easy mixing of officers and men
made their atmosphere delightful.</p>
<p>My camels were brought up to walk in Arab fashion, that bent-kneed
gait with much swinging of the fetlock, the stride a little longer and a
little quicker than the normal. Buxton’s camels strolled along at their
native pace, unaffected by the men on their backs, who were kept from
direct contact with them by iron-shod boots and by their wood and steel
Manchester-made saddles.</p>
<p>Consequently, though I started each stage alongside Buxton in the
van, I forged steadily in front with my five attendants; especially when
I rode my Baha, the immensely tall, large-boned, upstanding beast, who
got her name from the bleat-voice forced on her by a bullet through the
chin. She was very finely bred, but bad-tempered, half a wild camel, and
had never patience for an ordinary walk. Instead, with high nose and
wind-stirred hair, she would jig along in an uneasy dance, hateful to my
Ageyl for it strained their tender loins, but to me not un-amusing.</p>
<p>In this fashion we would gain three miles on the British, look for a
plot of grass or juicy thorns, lie in the warm freshness of air, and let
our beasts graze while we were overtaken; and a beautiful sight the
Camel Corps would be as it came up.</p>
<p>Through the mirage of heat which flickered over the shining
flint-stones of the ridge we would see, at first, only the knotted brown
mass of the column, swaying in the haze. As it grew nearer the masses
used to divide into little groups, which swung; parting and breaking
into one another. At last, when close to us, we would distinguish the
individual riders, like great water-birds breast-deep in the silver
mirage, with Buxton’s athletic, splendidly-mounted figure leading his
sunburnt, laughing, khaki men.</p>
<p>It was odd to see how diversely they rode. Some sat naturally,
despite the clumsy saddle; some pushed out their hinder-parts, and
leaned forward like Arab villagers; others lolled in the saddle as if
they were Australians riding horses. My men, judging by the look, were
inclined to scoff. I told them how from that three hundred I would pick
forty fellows who would out-ride, out-fight and out-suffer any forty men
in Feisal’s army.</p>
<p>At noon, by Ras Muheiwir, we halted an hour or two, for though the
heat to-day was less than in Egypt in August, Buxton did not wish to
drive his men through it without a break. The camels were loosed out,
while we lay and lunched and tried to sleep, defying the multitude of
flies which had marched with us from Bair in colonies on our sweaty
backs. Meanwhile, my bodyguard passed through, grumbling at their
indignity of baggage driving, making believe never to have been so
shamed before, and praying profanely that the world would not hear of my
tyranny to them.</p>
<p>Their sorrow was doubled since the baggage animals were Somali
camels, whose greatest speed was about three miles an hour. Buxton’s
force marched nearly four, myself more than five, so that the marches
were for the Zaagi and his forty thieves a torment of slowness, modified
only by baulking camels, or displaced loads.</p>
<p>We abused their clumsiness, calling them drovers and coolies,
offering to buy their goods when they came to market; till perforce they
laughed at their plight. After the first day they kept up with us by
lengthening the march into the night (only a little, for these
ophthalmia-stricken brutes were blind in the dark) and by stealing from
the breakfast and midday halts. They brought their caravan through
without losing one of all their charges; a fine performance for such
gilded gentlemen; only possible because under their gilt they were the
best camel-masters for hire in Arabia.</p>
<p>That night we slept in Ghadaf. The armoured car overtook us as we
halted, its delighted Sherari guide grinning in triumph on the turret
lid. An hour or two later the Zaagi arrived, reporting all up and well.
He begged that Buxton should not kill, directly in the road, such camels
as broke down on the march; for his men made each successive carcase
excuse for a feast and a delay.</p>
<p>Abdulla was troubled to understand why the British shot their
abandoned beasts. I pointed out how we Arabs shot one another if badly
wounded in battle; but Abdulla retorted it was to save us from being so
tortured that we might do ourselves shame. He believed there was hardly
a man alive who would not choose a gradual death of weakness in the
desert, rather than a sudden cutting off; indeed, in his judgement, the
slowest death was the most merciful of all, since absence of hope would
prevent the bitterness of a losing fight, and leave the man’s nature
untrammelled to compose itself and him into the mercy of God. Our
English argument, that it was kinder to kill quickly anything except a
man, he would not take seriously.</p>
