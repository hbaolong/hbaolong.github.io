<h4 id="chapter-lxxxii">CHAPTER LXXXII</h4>
<p>SHAMEFACED with triumph — which was not so much a triumph as homage
by Allenby to the mastering spirit of the place — we drove back to
Shea’s headquarters. The aides pushed about, and from great baskets drew
a lunch, varied, elaborate and succulent. On us fell a short space of
quiet, to be shattered by Monsieur Picot, the French political
representative permitted by Allenby to march beside Clayton in the
entry, who said in his fluting voice: ‘And to-morrow, my dear general, I
will take the necessary steps to set up civil government in this
town.’</p>
<p>It was the bravest word on record; a silence followed, as when they
opened the seventh seal in heaven. Salad, chicken mayonnaise and foie
gras sandwiches hung in our wet mouths unmunched, while we turned to
Allenby and gaped. Even he seemed for the moment at a loss. We began to
fear that the idol might betray a frailty. But his face grew red: he
swallowed, his chin coming forward (in the way we loved), whilst he
said, grimly, ‘In the military zone the only authority is that of the
Commander-in-Chief — myself.’ ‘But Sir Grey, Sir Edward Grey’… stammered
M. Picot. He was cut short. ‘Sir Edward Grey referred to the civil
government which will be established when I judge that the military
situation permits.’ And by car again, through the sunshine of a great
thankfulness, we sped down the saluting mountain-side into our camp.</p>
<p>There Allenby and Dawnay told me the British were marched and fought
nearly to a standstill, in the ledged and precipitous hills, shell-torn
and bullet-spattered, amid which they wrestled with the Turks along a
line from Ramleh to Jerusalem. So they would ask us in the lull to come
north towards the Dead Sea until, if possible, we linked right up to its
southern end, and renewed the continuous front. Fortunately, this had
already been discussed with Feisal, who was preparing the convergent
move on Tafileh, its necessary first step.</p>
<p>It was the moment to ask Allenby what he would do next. He thought he
was immobilized till the middle of February, when he would push down to
Jericho. Much enemy food was being lightered up the Dead Sea, and he
asked me to note this traffic as a second objective if the effort to
Tafileh prevailed.</p>
<p>I, hoping to improve on this, replied that, should the Turks be
continually shaken, we might join him at the north end of the Dead Sea.
If he could put Feisal’s fifty tons a day of supplies, stores and
ammunition into Jericho, we would abandon Akaba and transfer our
headquarters to the Jordan Valley. The Arab regulars, now some three
thousand strong, would suffice to make our retention of the river’s
eastern bank reasonably secure.</p>
<p>This idea commended itself to Allenby and Dawnay. They could almost
promise us such facilities when the railway reached Jerusalem some time
towards the end of the coming January. We might be able to move our base
two months after the line was through.</p>
<p>This talk left us a clear course of operations. The Arabs were to
reach the Dead Sea as soon as possible; to stop the transport of food up
it to Jericho before the middle of February; and to arrive at the Jordan
before the end of March. Since the first movement would take a month to
start, and all preliminaries were in hand, I could take a holiday. So I
went down to Cairo, and stayed there a week experimenting with insulated
cable and explosives.</p>
<p>After the week it seemed best to return to Akaba, where we arrived on
Christmas Day; to find Snagge, as senior officer in Akaba, entertaining
the British Community to dinner. He had screened-in the after deck and
built tables, which took the hosts and the twenty-odd guests easily.
Snagge stood godfather to the land, in hospitality, in the loan of his
ship’s doctor and workshop, and in cheerfulness.</p>
<p>In the early days of the revolt it had been the Hardinge which played
his role of providence to us. Once, at Yenbo, Feisal had ridden in from
the hills on a streaming day of winter, cold, wet, miserable and tired.
Captain Linberry sent a launch ashore and invited him to the ship, where
he found, waiting for him, a warm cabin, a peaceful meal, and a
bountiful bath. Afterwards he lay back in an arm-chair, smoking one of
his constant cigarettes, and remarked dreamily to me that now he knew
what the furnishings of heaven would be.</p>
<p>Joyce told me that things were well. The situation had sensibly
changed since Maulud’s victory. The Turks had concentrated in Aba el
Lissan. We were distracting them by raids against the line south of
Maan. Abdulla and Ali were doing the same near Medina; and the Turks,
being pinched to guard the railway, had to draw men from Aba el Lissan
to strengthen weak sections.</p>
<p>Maulud boldly threw our posts to places on the plateau, and began to
harry the supply caravans from Maan. He was hampered by the intense
cold, the rain and snow on the heights. Some of his ill-clad men
actually died of exposure. But the Turks lost equally in men and much
more in transport, since their mangy camels died off rapidly in the
storms and mud. The loss straitened them in food-carrying and involved
further withdrawals from Aba el Lissan.</p>
<p>At last they were too weak to hold the wide position, and, early in
January, Maulud was able to force them out towards Mreigha. The Beduin
caught the Turks moving, and cut up the hindmost battalion. This threw
the Turks back precipitately, to Uheida, only six miles from Maan, and
when we pressed after menacingly, they withdrew to Semna, the outpost
line of Maan, three miles out. So by January the seventh Maulud was
containing Maan directly.</p>
<p>Prosperity gave us ten days’ leisure; and as Joyce and myself were
rarely at liberty together we decided to celebrate the occasion by
taking a car-trip down the mud-flats towards Mudowwara.</p>
<p>The cars were now at Guweira, in permanent camp. Gilman and Dowsett,
with their crews and fifty Egyptian soldiers, had spent months in Wadi
Itm, building, like engineers, a motor road through the gorge. It had
been a great work, and was now in order to Guweira. So we took the Rolls
tenders, filled them with spare tyres, petrol, and food for four days,
and set off on our exploring trip.</p>
<p>The mud-flats were bone-dry and afforded perfect going. Our tyres
left only a faint white scar across their velvet surface, as we twisted
about the spacious smoothness at speed, skirting clumps of tamarisk and
roaring along under the great sandstone crags. The drivers rejoiced for
the first time in nine months, and flung forward abreast in a mad race.
Their speedometers touched sixty-five; not bad for cars which had been
months ploughing the desert with only such running repairs as the
drivers had time and tools to give them.</p>
<p>Across the sandy neck from the first flat to the second we built a
corduroy road of brushwood. When this was ready, the cars came steaming
and hissing along it, dangerously fast to avoid getting stuck, rocking
over hummocks in a style which looked fatal for springs. However, we
knew it was nearly impossible to break a Rolls-Royce, and so were
sorrier for the drivers, Thomas, Rolls and Sanderson. The jolts tore the
steering-wheel from their grip, and left them breathless with bleeding
hands after the crossing.</p>
<p>We lunched and rested, and then had another burst of speed, with a
wild diversion in the middle when a gazelle was sighted over the flat
and two of the great cars lurched aside in unavailing chase.</p>
<p>At the end of this second flat, the Gaa of Disi, we had a rough mile
to the third flat of Abu Sawana, across which we had a final glorious
sprint of fifteen miles, over the mud and over the equally firm flint
plains beyond. We slept there that chilly night, happy with bully beef
and tea and biscuit, with English talk and laughter round the fire,
golden with its shower of sparks from the fierce brushwood. When these
things tired, there was soft sand beneath our bodies and two blankets to
wrap ourselves in. For me it was a holiday, with not an Arab near,
before whom I must play out my tedious part.</p>
<p>In the morning we ran on nearly to Mudowwara, finding the ground
surface excellent to the watershed. So our reconnaissance had been a
quick and easy success. At once we turned back, to fetch the armoured
cars and undertake an immediate operation, with the help of the mountain
gun section on Talbots.</p>
<p>This section was an oddment, which General Clayton had seen in Egypt,
and had sent down to us in an inspired moment. Its six Talbots,
specially geared for heavy work, carried two ten-pounders with British
gunners. It was wicked to give good men such rotten tools; yet their
spirit seemed hardly affected by the inferior weapons. Their commander,
Brodie, was a silent Scotsman, never very buoyant and never too anxious;
a man who found difficulties shameful to notice, and who stamped himself
on his fellows. However hard the duty given them, they always attacked
it with such untroubled determination that their will prevailed. On
every occasion and in every crisis they would be surely in place at
their moment, perspiring but imperturbable, with never a word in
explanation or complaint.</p>
<p>Eight imposing cars drove off from Guweira next day, and reached our
old stopping-place behind Mudowwara by sundown. This was excellent; and
we camped, intending to find a road to the railway in the morning.
Accordingly we set off early in a Rolls tender and searched through the
very nasty low hills till evening, when we were in place behind the last
ridge, above Tell Shahm, the second station northward from
Mudowwara.</p>
<p>We had talked vaguely of mining a train, but the country was too
open, and enemy blockhouses numerous. Instead we determined to attack a
little entrenched work exactly opposite our hiding-place. So late in new
year’s morning, a day as cool as a good summer’s day in England, after a
pleasant breakfast we rolled gently over a stony plain to a hillock
which overlooked the Turkish post. Joyce and I got out of our cars and
climbed its summit, to look on.</p>
<p>Joyce was in charge, and for the first time I was at a fight as
spectator. The novelty was most enjoyable. Armoured car work seemed
fighting de luxe, for our troops, being steel-covered, could come to no
hurt. Accordingly we made a field-day of it like the best regular
generals, sitting in laconic conference on our hill-top and watching the
battle intently through binoculars.</p>
<p>The Talbot battery opened the affair, coming spiritedly into action
just below our point; while the three armoured cars crawled about the
flanks of the Turkish earthwork like great dogs nosing out a trail. The
enemy soldiers popped up their heads to gaze, and everything was very
friendly and curious, till the cars slewed round their Vickers and began
to spray the trenches. Then the Turks, realizing that it was an attack,
got down behind their parapets and fired at the cars raggedly. It was
about as deadly as trying to warm a rhinoceros with bird-shot: after a
while they turned their attention to Brodie’s guns and peppered the
earth about them with bullets.</p>
<p>Obviously they did not mean to surrender, and obviously we had no
means at disposal to compel them. So we drew off, contented with having
prowled up and down the line, and proved the surface hard enough for
car-operations at deliberate speed. However, the men looked for more,
and to humour them we drove southward till opposite Shahm. There Brodie
chose a gun-position at two thousand yards and began to throw shell
after shell neatly into the station area.</p>
<p>Hating this, the Turks trickled off to a blockhouse, while the cars
put leisurely bullets through the station doors and windows. They might
have entered it safely, had there been point in doing so. As it was we
called everybody off again, and returned into our hiding-hills. Our
anxiety and forethought had been all to reach the railway through the
manifold difficulties of the plains and hills. When we did reach it, we
were entirely unready for action, with not a conception of what our
tactics or methods should be: yet we learned much from this very
indecision.</p>
<p>The certainty that in a day from Guweira we could be operating along
the railway, meant that traffic lay at our mercy. All the Turks in
Arabia could not fight a single armoured car in open country. Thereby
the situation of Medina, already bad, became hopeless. The German Staff
saw it, and after Falkenhayn’s visit to Maan, they repeatedly urged
abandonment of everything south of that point; but the old Turk party
valued Medina as the last remnant of their sovereignty in the Holy
Places, their surviving claim upon the Caliphate. Sentiment swung them
to the decision, against military expediency.</p>
<p>The British seemed curiously dense about Medina. They insisted that
it must be captured, and lavished money and explosives on the operations
which Ali and Abdulla continually undertook from their Yenbo base. When
I pleaded to the contrary, they treated my view as a witty paradox.
Accordingly, to excuse our deliberate inactivity in the north, we had to
make a show of impotence, which gave them to understand that the Arabs
were too poltroon to cut the line near Maan and keep it cut. This reason
gratified their sense of fitness, for soldiers, always ready to believe
ill of native action, took its inferiority as a compliment. So we
battened on our ill reputation, which was an ungenerous stratagem, but
the easiest. The staff knew so much more of war than I did that they
refused to learn from me of the strange conditions in which Arab
irregulars had to act; and I could not be bothered to set up a
kindergarten of the imagination for their benefit.</p>
