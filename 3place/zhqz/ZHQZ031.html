<h4 id="chapter">CHAPTER</h4>
<p>XXSUDDENLY Feisal asked me if I would wear Arab clothes like his own
while in the camp. I should find it better for my own part, since it was
a comfortable dress in which to live Arab-fashion as we must do.
Besides, the tribesmen would then understand how to take me. The only
wearers of khaki in their experience had been Turkish officers, before
whom they took up an instinctive defence. If I wore Meccan clothes, they
would behave to me as though I were really one of the leaders; and I
might slip in and out of Feisal’s tent without making a sensation which
he had to explain away each time to strangers.</p>
<p>I agreed at once, very gladly; for army uniform was abominable when
camel-riding, or when sitting about on the ground; and the Arab things,
which I had learned to manage before the war, were cleaner and more
decent in the desert. Hejris was pleased, too, and exercised his fancy
in fitting me out in splendid white silk and gold-embroidered wedding
garments which had been sent to Feisal lately (was it a hint?) by his
great-aunt in Mecca. I took a stroll in the new looseness of them round
the palm-gardens of Mubarak and Bruka, to accustom myself to their
feel.</p>
<p>These villages were pleasant little places, built of mud brick on the
high earth mounds encircling the palm-gardens. Nakhl Mubarak lay to the
north, and Bruka just south of it across a thorny valley. The houses
were small, mud-washed inside, cool, and very clean, furnished with a
mat or two, a coffee mortar, and food pots and trays. The narrow streets
were shaded by an occasional well-grown tree. The earth embankments
round the cultivated areas were sometimes fifty feet in height, and had
been for the most part artificially formed from the surplus earth dug
out between the trees, from household rubbish and from stones gathered
out of the Wadi.</p>
<p>The banks were to defend the crops from flood. Wadi Yenbo otherwise
would soon have filled the gardens, since these, to be irrigable, must
be below the valley floor. The narrow plots were divided by fences of
palm-ribs or by mud walls, with narrow streams of sweet water in raised
channels round them. Each garden gate was over water, with a bridge of
three or four parallel palm-logs built up to it for the passage of
donkeys or camels. Each plot had a mud sluice, scooped away when its
turn for watering came. The palms, regularly planted in ordered lines
and well cared for, were the main crop; but between them were grown
barley, radishes, marrows, cucumbers, tobacco and henna. Villages higher
up Wadi Yenbo were cool enough to grow grapes.</p>
<p>Feisal’s stand in Nakhl Mubarak could in the nature of things only be
a pause, and I felt that I had better get back to Yenbo, to think
seriously about our amphibious defence of this port, the Navy having
promised its every help. We settled that I should consult Zeid, and act
with him as seemed best. Feisal gave me a magnificent bay camel for the
trip back. We marched through the Agida hills by a new road, Wadi
Messarih, because of a scare of Turkish patrols on the more direct line.
Bedr ibn Shefia was with me; and we did the distance gently in a single
stage of six hours, getting to Yenbo before dawn. Being tired after
three strenuous days of little sleep among constant alarms and
excitements I went straight to Garland’s empty house (he was living on
board ship in the harbour) and fell asleep on a bench; but afterwards I
was called out again by the news that Sherif Zeid was coming, and went
down to the walls to see the beaten force ride in.</p>
<p>There were about eight hundred of them, quiet, but in no other way
mortified by their shame. Zeid himself seemed finely indifferent. As he
entered the town he turned and cried to Abd el Kadir, the Governor,
riding behind him, ‘Why, your town is ruinous! I must telegraph to my
father for forty masons to repair the public buildings.’ And this
actually he did. I had telegraphed to Captain Boyle that Yenbo was
gravely threatened, and Boyle at once replied that his fleet would be
there in time, if not sooner. This readiness was an opportune
consolation: worse news came along next day. The Turks, by throwing a
strong force forward from Bir Said against Nakhl Mubarak, had closed
with Feisal’s levies while they were yet unsteady. After a short fight,
Feisal had broken off, yielded his ground, and was retreating here. Our
war seemed entering its last act. I took my camera, and from the parapet
of the Medina gate got a fine photograph of the brothers coming in.
Feisal had nearly two thousand men with him, but none of the Juheina
tribesmen. It looked like treachery and a real defection of the tribes,
things which both of us had ruled out of court as impossible.</p>
<p>I called at once at his house and he told me the history. The Turks
had come on with three battalions and a number of mule-mounted infantry
and camelry. Their command was in the hands of Ghalib Bey, who handled
his troops with great keenness, acting as he did under the eye of the
Corps Commander. Fakhru Pasha privately accompanied the expedition,
whose guide and go-between with the Arabs was Dakhil-Allah el Kadhi, the
hereditary law-giver of the Juheina, a rival of Sherif Mohammed Ali el
Beidawi, and after him the second man in the tribe.</p>
<p>They got across Wadi Yenbo to the groves of Bruka in their first
onset, and thus threatened the Arab communications with Yenbo. They were
also able to shell Nakhl Mubarak freely with their seven guns. Feisal
was not a whit dismayed, but threw out the Juheina on his left to work
down the great valley. His centre and right he kept in Nakhl Mubarak,
and he sent the Egyptian artillery to take post in Jebel Agida, to deny
that to the Turks. Then he opened fire on Bruka with his own two
fifteen-pounders.</p>
<p>Rasim, a Syrian officer, formerly a battery commander in the Turkish
Army, was fighting these two guns; and he made a great demonstration
with them. They had been sent down as a gift from Egypt, anyhow, old
rubbish thought serviceable for the wild Arabs, just as the sixty
thousand rifles supplied the Sherif were condemned weapons, relics of
the Gallipoli campaign. So Rasim had no sights, nor range-finder, no
range tables, no high explosive.</p>
<p>His distance might have been six thousand yards; but the fuses of his
shrapnel were Boer War antiquities, full of green mould, and, if they
burst, it was sometimes short in the air, and sometimes grazing.
However, he had no means of getting his ammunition away if things went
wrong, so he blazed off at speed, shouting with laughter at this fashion
of making war; and the tribesmen seeing the commandant so merry took
heart of grace themselves. ‘By God,’ said one, ‘those are the real guns:
the Importance of their noise!’ Rasim swore that the Turks were dying in
heaps; and the Arabs charged forward warmly at his word.</p>
<p>Things were going well; and Feisal had the hope of a decisive success
when suddenly his left wing in the valley wavered, halted; finally it
turned its back on the enemy and retired tumultuously to the camping
ground. Feisal, in the centre, galloped to Rasim and cried that the
Juheina had broken and he was to save the guns. Rasim yoked up the teams
and trotted away to Wadi Agida, wherein the Egyptians were taking
counsel pavidly with one another. After him streamed the Ageyl and the
Atban, the men of Ibn Shefia, the Harb and Biasha. Feisal and his
household composed the rear, and in deliberate procession they moved
down towards Yenbo, leaving the Juheina with the Turks on the
battlefield.</p>
<p>As I was still hearing of this sad end and cursing with him the
traitor Beidawi brothers, there was a stir about the door, and Abd el
Kerim broke through the slaves, swung up to the dais, kissed Feisal’s
head-rope in salutation, and sat down beside us. Feisal with a gasping
stare at him, said, ‘How?’ and Abd el Kerim explained their dismay at
the sudden flight of Feisal, and how he with his brother and their
gallant men had fought the Turks for the whole night, alone, without
artillery, till the palm-groves became untenable and they too had been
driven through Wadi Agida. His brother, with half the manhood of the
tribe, was just entering the gate. The others had fallen back up Wadi
Yenbo for water.</p>
<p>‘And why did you retire to the camp-ground behind us during the
battle?’ asked Feisal. ‘Only to make ourselves a cup of coffee,’ said
Abd el Kerim. ‘We had fought from sunrise and it was dusk: we were very
tired and thirsty.’ Feisal and I lay back and laughed: then we went to
see what could be done to save the town.</p>
<p>The first step was simple. We sent all the Juheina back to Wadi Yenbo
with orders to mass at Kheif, and keep up a steady pressure on the
Turkish line of communications. They were also to push sniping parties
down the Agida hills. This diversion would hold up so many of the Turks
that they would be unable to bring against Yenbo a force superior in
number to the defenders, who in addition had the advantage of a good
position. The town on the top of its flat reef of coral rose perhaps
twenty feet above the sea, and was compassed by water on two sides. The
other two sides looked over flat stretches of sand, soft in places,
destitute of cover for miles, and with no fresh water upon them
anywhere. In daylight, if defended by artillery and machine-gun fire,
they should be impregnable.</p>
<p>The artillery was arriving every minute; for Boyle, as usual far
better than his word, had concentrated five ships on us in less than
twenty-four hours. He put the monitor M.31, whose shallow draught fitted
her for the job, in the end of the south-eastern creek of the harbour,
whence she could rake the probable direction of a Turkish advance with
her six-inch guns. Crocker, her captain, was very anxious to let off
those itching guns. The larger ships were moored to fire over the town
at longer range, or to rake the other flank from the northern harbour.
The searchlights of Dufferin and M.31 crossed on the plain beyond the
town.</p>
<p>The Arabs, delighted to count up the quantity of vessels in the
harbour, were prepared to contribute their part to the night’s
entertainment. They gave us good hope there would be no further panic:
but to reassure them fully they needed some sort of rampart to defend,
mediæval fashion: it was no good digging trenches, partly because the
ground was coral rock, and, besides, they had no experience of trenches
and might not have manned them confidently. So we took the crumbling,
salt-riddled wall of the place, doubled it with a second, packed earth
between the two, and raised them till our sixteenth-century bastions
were rifle-proof at least, and probably proof against the Turkish
mountain guns. Outside the bastions we put barbed wire, festooned
between cisterns on the rain catchments beyond the walls. We dug in
machine-gun nests in the best angles, and manned them with Feisal’s
regular gunners. The Egyptians, like everyone else given a place in the
scheme, were gratifyingly happy. Garland was engineer-in-chief and chief
adviser.</p>
<p>After sun-down the town quivered with suppressed excitement. So long
as the day lasted there had been shouts and joy-shots and wild bursts of
frenzy among the workmen; but when dark came, they went back to feed and
a hush fell. Nearly everyone sat up that night. There was one alarm
about eleven o’clock. Our outposts had met the enemy only three miles
outside the town. Garland, with a crier, went through the few streets,
and called the garrison. They tumbled straight out and went to their
places in dead silence without a shot or a loose shout. The seamen on
the minaret sent warning to the ships, whose combined searchlights began
slowly to traverse the plain in complex intersections, drawing pencils
of wheeling light across the flats which the attacking force must cross.
However, no sign was made and no cause given us to open fire.</p>
<p>Afterwards, old Dakhil Allah told me he had guided the Turks down to
rush Yenbo in the dark that they might stamp out Feisal’s army once for
all; but their hearts had failed them at the silence and the blaze of
lighted ships from end to end of the harbour, with the eerie beams of
the searchlights revealing the bleakness of the glacis they would have
to cross. So they turned back: and that night, I believe, the Turks lost
their war. Personally, I was on the Suva, to be undisturbed, and
sleeping splendidly at last; so I was grateful to Dakhil Allah for the
prudence which he preached the Turks, as though we might perhaps have
won a glorious victory, I was ready to give much more for just that
eight hours’ unbroken rest.</p>
