<h4 id="chapter-lxxxvii">CHAPTER LXXXVII</h4>
<p>HESA’S sole profit lay, then, in its lesson to myself. Never again
were we combative, whether in jest, or betting on a certainty. Indeed,
only three days later, our honour was partially redeemed by a good and
serious thing we arranged through Abdulla el Feir, who was camped
beneath us in the paradise of the Dead Sea’s southern shore, a plain
gushing with brooks of sweet water, and rich in vegetation. We sent him
news of victory, with a project to raid the lake-port of Kerak and
destroy the Turks’ flotilla.</p>
<p>He chose out some seventy horsemen, of the Beersheba Beduin. They
rode in the night along the shelf of track between the hills of Moab and
the Sea’s brim as far as the Turkish post; and in the first greyness,
when their eyes could reach far enough for a gallop, they burst out of
their undergrowth upon motor launch and sailing lighters, harboured in
the northern bight, with the unsuspecting crews sleeping on the beach or
in the reed-huts near by.</p>
<p>They were from the Turkish Navy, not prepared for land fighting,
still less for receiving cavalry: they were awakened only by the
drumming of our horses’ hooves in the headlong charge: and the
engagement ended at the moment. The huts were burned, the stores looted,
the shipping taken out to deep sea and scuttled. Then, without a
casualty, and with their sixty prisoners, our men rode back praising
themselves. January the twenty-eighth; and we had attained our second
objective — the stopping of Dead Sea traffic — a fortnight sooner than
we had promised Allenby.</p>
<p>The third objective had been the Jordan mouth by Jericho, before the
end of March; and it would have been a fair prospect, but for the
paralysis which weather and distaste for pain had brought upon us since
the red day of Hesa. Conditions in Tafileh were mended. Feisal had sent
us ammunition and food. Prices fell, as men grew to trust our strength.
The tribes about Kerak, in daily touch with Zeid, purposed to join him
in arms so soon as he moved forward.</p>
<p>Just this, however, we could not do. The winter’s potency drove
leaders and men into the village and huddled them in a lack-lustre
idleness against which counsels of movement availed little. Indeed,
Reason, also, was within doors. Twice I ventured up to taste the
snow-laden plateau, upon whose even face the Turkish dead, poor brown
pats of stiffened clothes, were littered: but life there was not
tolerable. In the day it thawed a little and in the night it froze. The
wind cut open the skin: fingers lost power, and sense of feel: cheeks
shivered like dead leaves till they could shiver no more, and then bound
up their muscles in a witless ache.</p>
<p>To launch out across the snow on camels, beasts singularly inept on
slippery ground, would be to put ourselves in the power of however few
horsemen wished to oppose us; and, as the days dragged on, even this
last possibility was withdrawn. Barley ran short in Tafileh, and our
camels, already cut off by the weather from natural grazing, were now
also cut off from artificial food. We had to drive them down into the
happier Ghor, a day’s journey from our vital garrison.</p>
<p>Though so far by the devious road, yet in direct distance the Ghor
lay little more than six miles away, and in full sight, five thousand
feet below. Salt was rubbed into our miseries by the spectacle of that
near winter garden beneath us by the lake-side. We were penned in
verminous houses of cold stone; lacking fuel, lacking food; storm-bound
in streets like sewers, amid blizzards of sleet and an icy wind: while
there in the valley was sunshine upon spring grass, deep with flowers,
upon flocks in milk and air so warm that men went uncloaked.</p>
<p>My private party were more fortunate than most, as the Zaagi had
found us an empty unfinished house, of two sound rooms and a court. My
money provided fuel, and even grain for our camels, which we kept
sheltered in a corner of the yard, where Abdulla, the animal lover,
could curry them and teach every one by name to take a gift of bread,
like a kiss, from his mouth, gently, with her loose lips, when he called
her. Still, they were unhappy days, since to have a fire was to be
stifled with green smoke, and in the window-spaces were only makeshift
shutters of our own joinery. The mud roof dripped water all the day
long, and the fleas on the stone floor sang together nightly, for praise
of the new meats given them. We were twenty-eight in the two tiny rooms,
which reeked with the sour smell of our crowd.</p>
<p>In my saddle-bags was a Morte d’Arthur. It relieved my disgust. The
men had only physical resources; and in the confined misery their
tempers roughened. Their oddnesses, which ordinary time packed with a
saving film of distance, now jostled me angrily; while a grazed wound in
my hip had frozen, and irritated me with painful throbbing. Day by day,
the tension among us grew, as our state became more sordid, more
animal.</p>
<p>At last Awad, the wild Sherari, quarrelled with little Mahmas; and in
a moment their daggers clashed. The rest nipped the tragedy, so that
there was only a slight wounding: but it broke the greatest law of the
bodyguard, and as both example and guilt were blatant, the others went
packing into the far room while their chiefs forthwith executed
sentence. However, the Zaagi’s shrill whip-strokes were too cruel for my
taught imagination, and I stopped him before he was well warmed. Awad,
who had lain through his punishment without complaint, at this release
levered himself slowly to his knees and with bent legs and swaying head
staggered away to his sleeping-place.</p>
<p>It was then the turn of the waiting Mahmas, a tight-lipped youth with
pointed chin and pointed forehead, whose beady eyes dropped at the inner
corners with an indescribable air of impatience. He was not properly of
my guard, but a camel-driver; for his capacity fell far below his sense
of it, and a constantly-hurt pride made him sudden and fatal in
companionship. If worsted in argument, or laughed at, he would lean
forward with his always handy little dagger and rip up his friend. Now
he shrank into a corner showing his teeth, vowing, across his tears, to
be through those who hurt him. Arabs did not dissect endurance, their
crown of manhood, into material and moral, making allowance for nerves.
So Mahmas’ crying was called fear, and when loosed, he crept out
disgraced into the night to hide.</p>
<p>I was sorry for Awad: his hardness put me to shame. Especially I was
ashamed when, next dawn, I heard a limping step in the yard, and saw him
attempting to do his proper duty by the camels. I called him in to give
him an embroidered head-cloth as reward for faithful service. He came
pitiably sullen, with a shrinking, mobile readiness for more punishment:
my changed manner broke him down. By afternoon he was singing and
shouting, happier than ever, as he had found a fool in Tafileh to pay
him four pounds for my silken gift.</p>
<p>Such nervous sharpening ourselves on each other’s faults was so
revolting that I decided to scatter the party, and to go off myself in
search of the extra money we should need when fine weather came. Zeid
had spent the first part of the sum set aside for Tafileh and the Dead
Sea; partly on wages, partly on supplies and in rewards to the victors
of Seil Hesa. Wherever we next put our front line, we should have to
enlist and pay fresh forces, for only local men knew the qualities of
their ground instinctively; and they fought best, defending their homes
and crops against the enemy.</p>
<p>Joyce might have arranged to send me money: but not easily in this
season. It was surer to go down myself: and more virtuous than continued
fœtor and promiscuity in Tafileh. So five of us started off on a day
which promised to be a little more open than usual. We made good time to
Reshidiya and as we climbed the saddle beyond, found ourselves
momentarily above the clouds in a faint sunshine.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the weather drew down again and the wind hardened
from the north and east, and made us sorry to be out on the bare plain.
When we had forded the running river of Shobek, rain began to fall,
first in wild gusts, but then more steadily, reeding down over our left
shoulders and seeming to cloak us from the main bleakness of wind. Where
the rain-streaks hit the ground they furred out whitely like a spray. We
pushed on without halting and till long after sunset urged our trembling
camels, with many slips, and falls across the greasy valleys. We made
nearly two miles an hour, despite our difficulties; and progress was
become so exciting and unexpected that its mere exercise kept us
warm.</p>
<p>It had been my intention to ride all night: but, near Odroh, mist
came down about us in a low ring curtain, over which the clouds, like
tatters of a veil, spun and danced high up across the calmness of the
sky. The perspective seemed to change, so that far hills looked small,
and near hillocks great. We bore too much to the right.</p>
<p>This open country, though appearing hard, broke rottenly beneath
their weight and let our camels in, four or five inches deep, at every
stride. The poor beasts had been chilled all day, and had bumped down so
often that they were stiff with bruises. Consequently, they made
unwilling work of the new difficulties. They hurried for a few steps,
stopped abruptly, looked round, or tried to dart off sideways.</p>
<p>We prevented their wishes, and drove them forward till our blind way
met rocky valleys, with a broken skyline; dark to right and left, and in
front apparent hills where no hills should be. It froze again, and the
slabby stones of the valley became iced. To push farther, on the wrong
road, through such a night was folly. We found a larger outcrop of rock.
Behind it, where there should have been shelter, we couched our camels
in a compact group, tails to wind: facing it, they might die of cold. We
snuggled down beside them hoping for warmth and sleep.</p>
<p>The warmth I, at least, never got, and hardly the sleep. I dozed once
only to wake with a start when slow fingers seemed to stroke my face. I
stared out into a night livid with large, soft snowflakes. They lasted a
minute or two; but then followed rain, and after it more frost, while I
squatted in a tight ball, aching every way but too miserable to move,
till dawn. It was a hesitant dawn, but enough: I rolled over in the mud
to see my men, knotted in their cloaks, cowering abandoned against the
beasts’ flanks. On each man’s face weighed the most dolorous expression
of resigned despair.</p>
<p>They were four southerners, whom fear of the winter had turned ill at
Tafileh, and who were going to rest in Guweira till it was warm again:
but here in the mist they had made up their minds, like he-camels, that
death was upon them: and, though they were too proud to grumble at it,
they were not above showing me silently that this which they made for my
sake was a sacrifice. They did not speak or move in reply to me. Under a
flung camel it was best to light a slow fire, to raise it: but I took
the smallest of these dummies by the head-curls, and proved to him that
he was still capable of feeling. The others got to their feet, and we
kicked up the stiff camels. Our only loss was a water-skin, frozen to
the ground.</p>
<p>With daylight the horizon had grown very close, and we saw that our
proper road was a quarter of a mile to our left. Along it we struggled
afoot. The camels were too done to carry our weight (all but my own died
later of this march) and it was so muddy in the clay bottoms that we
ourselves slid and fell like them. However, the Deraa trick helped, of
spreading wide the toes and hooking them downward into the mud at each
stride: and by this means, in a group, clutching and holding one
another, we maintained progress.</p>
<p>The air seemed cold enough to freeze anything, but did not: the wind,
which had changed during the night, swept into us from the west in
hindering blizzards. Our cloaks bellied out and dragged like sails,
against us. At last we skinned them off, and went easier, our bare
shirts wrapped tightly about us to restrain their slapping tails. The
whirling direction of the squalls was shown to our eyes by the white
mist they carried across hill and dale. Our hands were numbed into
insensibility, so that we knew the cuts on them only by red stains in
their plastered mud: but our bodies were not so chill, and for hours
quivered under the hailstones of each storm. We twisted ourselves to get
the sharpness on an unhurt side, and held our shirts free from the skin,
to shield us momentarily.</p>
<p>By late afternoon we had covered the ten miles to Aba el Lissan.
Maulud’s men were gone to ground, and no one hailed us; which was well,
for we were filthy and miserable; stringy like shaven cats. Afterwards
the going was easier, the last two miles to the head of Shtar being
frozen like iron. We remounted our camels, whose breath escaped whitely
through their protesting nostrils, and raced up to the first wonderful
glimpse of the Guweira plain, warm, red and comfortable, as seen through
the cloud-gaps. The clouds had ceiled the hollow strangely, cutting the
mid-sky in a flat layer of curds at the level of the hill-top on which
we stood: we gazed on them contentedly for minutes. Every little while a
wisp of their fleecy sea-foam stuff would be torn away and thrown at us.
We on the wall of bluffs would feel it slash across our faces; and,
turning, would see a white hem draw over the rough crest, tear to shreds
and vanish in a powdering of hoar grains or a trickle of water across
the peat soil.</p>
<p>After having wondered at the sky we slid and ran gaily down the pass
to dry sand in a calm mild air. Yet the pleasure was not vivid, as we
had hoped. The pain of the blood fraying its passage once more about our
frozen limbs and faces was much faster than the pain of its driving out:
and we grew sensible that our feet had been torn and bruised nearly to
pulp among the stones. We had not felt them tender while in the icy mud;
but this warm, salty sand scoured the cuts. In desperation we climbed up
our sad camels, and beat them woodenly towards Guweira. However, the
change had made them happier, and they brought us home there sedately,
but with success.</p>
