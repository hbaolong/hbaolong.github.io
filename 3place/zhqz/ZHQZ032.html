<h4 id="chapter-xxi">CHAPTER XXI</h4>
<p>NEXT day the crisis had passed: the Turks had clearly failed. The
Juheina were active in their flank position from Wadi Yenbo. Garland’s
architectural efforts about the town became impressive. Sir Archibald
Murray, to whom Feisal had appealed for a demonstration in Sinai to
prevent further withdrawals of Turks for service at Medina, sent back an
encouraging reply, and everybody was breathing easily. A few days later
Boyle dispersed the ships, promising another lightning concentration
upon another warning; and I took the opportunity to go down to Rabegh,
where I met Colonel Bremond, the great bearded chief of the French
Military Mission, and the only real soldier in Hejaz. He was still using
his French detachment in Suez as a lever to move a British Brigade into
Rabegh; and, since he suspected I was not wholly of his party, he made
an effort to convert me.</p>
<p>In the course of the argument which followed, I said something about
the need of soon attacking Medina; for, with the rest of the British, I
believed that the fall of Medina was a necessary preliminary to any
further progress of the Arab Revolt. He took me up sharply, saying that
it was in no wise proper for the Arabs to take Medina. In his view, the
Arab Movement had attained its maximum utility by the mere rebellion in
Mecca; and military operations against Turkey were better in the unaided
hands of Great Britain and France. He wished to land Allied troops at
Rabegh, because it would quench the ardour of the tribes by making the
Sherif suspect in their eyes. The foreign troops would then be his main
defence, and his preservation be our work and option, until at the end
of the war, when Turkey was defeated, the victorious Powers could
extract Medina by treaty from the Sultan, and confer it upon Hussein,
with the legal sovereignty of Hejaz, as his rewards for faithful
service.</p>
<p>I had not his light confidence in our being strong enough to dispense
with small allies; so I said shortly that my opinions were opposed to
his. I laid the greatest weight on the immediate conquest of Medina, and
was advising Feisal to seize Wejh, in order to prolong his threat
against the railway. In sum, to my mind, the Arab Movement would not
justify its creation if the enthusiasm of it did not carry the Arabs
into Damascus.</p>
<p>This was unwelcome to him; for the Sykes-Picot Treaty of 1916 between
France and England had been drawn by Sykes for this very eventuality;
and, to reward it, stipulated the establishment of independent Arab
states in Damascus, Aleppo and Mosul, districts which would otherwise
fall to the unrestricted control of France. Neither Sykes nor Picot had
believed the thing really possible; but I knew that it was, and believed
that after it the vigour of the Arab Movement would prevent the creation
— by us or others — in Western Asia of unduly ‘colonial’ schemes of
exploitation.</p>
<p>Bremond took refuge in his technical sphere, and assured me, on his
honour as a staff-officer, that for Feisal to leave Yenbo and go to Wejh
was military suicide; but I saw no force in the arguments which he threw
at me volubly; and told him so. It was a curious interview, that,
between an old soldier and a young man in fancy dress; and it left a bad
taste in my mouth. The Colonel, like his countrymen, was a realist in
love, and war. Even in situations of poetry the French remained
incorrigible prose-writers, seeing by the directly-thrown light of
reason and understanding, not through the half-closed eye, mistily, by
things’ essential radiance, in the manner of the imaginative British: so
the two races worked ill together on a great undertaking. However, I
controlled myself enough not to tell any Arab of the conversation, but
sent a full account of it to Colonel Wilson, who was shortly coming up
to see Feisal for a discussion of the Wejh prospect in all its
bearings.</p>
<p>Before Wilson arrived the centre of Turkish gravity changed abruptly.
Fakhri Pashi had seen the hopelessness of attacking Yenbo, or of driving
after the intangible Juheina in Kheif Hussein. Also he was being
violently bombed in Nakhl Mubarak itself by a pair of British seaplanes
which did hardy flights over the desert and got well into the enemy on
two occasions, despite their shrapnel.</p>
<p>Consequently he decided to fall back in a hurry on Bir Said, leaving
a small force there to check the Juheina, and to move down the Sultani
road towards Rabegh with the bulk of his men. These changes were no
doubt partly impelled by the unusual vigour of Ali at Rabegh. As soon as
Ali had heard of Zeid’s defeat he had sent him reinforcements and guns;
and when Feisal himself collapsed he decided to move north with all his
army, to attack the Turks in Wadi Safra and draw them off Yenbo. Ali had
nearly seven thousand men; and Feisal felt that if the move was
synchronized with one on his part, Fakhri’s force might be crushed
between them in the hills. He telegraphed, suggesting this, asking for a
delay of a few days till his shaken men were ready.</p>
<p>Ali was strung up and would not wait. Feisal therefore rushed Zeid
out to Masahali in Wadi Yenbo to make preparations. When these were
complete he sent Zeid on to occupy Bir Said, which was done
successfully. He then ordered the Juheina forward in support. They
demurred; for ibn Beidawi was jealous of Feisal’s growing power among
his tribes, and wanted to keep himself indispensable. Feisal rode
unattended to Nakhl Mubarak, and in one night convinced the Juheina that
he was their leader. Next morning they were all moving, while he went on
to collect the northern Harb on the Tasha Pass to interrupt the Turkish
retreat in Wadi Safra. He had nearly six thousand men; and if Ali took
the southern bank of the valley the weak Turks would be between two
fires.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it did not happen. When actually on the move he heard
from Ali that, after a peaceful recovery of Bir ibn Hassani, his men had
been shaken by false reports of disloyalty among the Subh, and had
fallen back in rapid disorder to Rabegh.</p>
<p>In this ominous pause Colonel Wilson came up to Yenbo to persuade us
of the necessity of an immediate operation against Wejh. An amended plan
had been drawn up whereby Feisal would take the whole force of the
Juheina, and his permanent battalions, against Wejh with the maximum of
naval help. This strength would make success reasonably sure, but it
left Yenbo empty and defenceless. For the moment Feisal dreaded
incurring such a risk. He pointed out, not unreasonably, that the Turks
in his neighbourhood were still mobile; that Ali’s force had proved
hollow, unlikely to defend even Rabegh against serious attack; and that,
as Rabegh was the bulwark of Mecca, sooner than see it lost he must
throw away Yenbo and ferry himself and men thither to die fighting on
its beach.</p>
<p>To reassure him, Wilson painted the Rabegh force in warm colours.
Feisal checked his sincerity by asking for his personal word that the
Rabegh garrison, with British naval help, would resist enemy attack till
Wejh fell. Wilson looked for support round the silent deck of the
Dufferin (on which we were conferring), and nobly gave the required
assurance: a wise gamble, since without it Feisal would not move; and
this diversion against Wejh, the only offensive in the Arabs’ power, was
their last chance not so much of securing a convincing siege of Medina,
as of preventing the Turkish capture of Mecca. A few days later he
strengthened himself by sending Feisal direct orders from his father,
the Sherif, to proceed to Wejh at once, with all his available
troops.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Rabegh situation grew worse. The enemy in Wadi Safra
and the Sultani road were estimated at nearly five thousand men. The
Harb of the north were suppliant to them for preservation of their
palm-groves. The Harb of the south, those of Hussein Mabeirig,
notoriously waited their advance to attack the Sherifians in the rear.
At a conference of Wilson, Bremond, Joyce, Ross and others, held in
Rabegh on Christmas Eve, it was decided to lay out on the beach by the
aerodrome a small position, capable of being held under the ship’s guns
by the Egyptians, the Flying Corps and a seamen’s landing party from the
Minerva, for the few hours needed to embark or destroy the stores. The
Turks were advancing step by step; and the place was not in condition to
resist one well-handled battalion supported by field artillery.</p>
<p>However, Fakhri was too slow. He did not pass Bir el Sheikh in any
force till near the end of the first week in January, and seven days
later was still not ready to attack Khoreiba, where Ali had an outpost
of a few hundred men. The patrols were in touch; and an assault was
daily expected, but as regularly delayed.</p>
<p>In truth the Turks were meeting with unguessed difficulties. Their
headquarters were faced by a heavy sick rate among the men, and a
growing weakness of the animals: both symptoms of overwork and lack of
decent food. Always the activity of the tribesmen behind their back
hampered them. Clans might sometimes fall away from the Arab cause, but
did not therefore become trustworthy adherents of the Turks, who soon
found themselves in ubiquitously hostile country. The tribal raids in
the first fortnight of January caused them average daily losses of forty
camels and some twenty men killed and wounded, with corresponding
expense in stores.</p>
<p>These raids might occur at any point from ten miles seaward of Medina
itself for the next seventy miles through the hills. They illustrated
the obstacles in the way of the new Turkish Army with its
half-Germanized complexity of equipment, when, from a distant railhead
with no made roads, it tried to advance through extremely rugged and
hostile country. The administrative developments of scientific war had
clogged its mobility and destroyed its dash; and troubles grew in
geometrical rather than arithmetical progression for each new mile its
commanding officers put between themselves and Medina, their ill-found,
insecure and inconvenient base.</p>
<p>The situation was so unpromising for the Turks that Fakhri was
probably half glad when the forthcoming sudden moves of Abdulla and
Feisal in the last days of 1916 altered the strategic conception of the
Hejaz war, and hurried the Mecca expedition (after January the
eighteenth 1917) back from the Sultani and the Fara and the Gaha roads,
back from Wadi Safra, to hold a passive defence of trenches within sight
of the walls of Medina; a static position which endured till the
Armistice ended the war and involved Turkey in the dismal surrender of
the Holy City and its helpless garrison.</p>
