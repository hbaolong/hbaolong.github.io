<h4 id="chapter-lxxxiv">CHAPTER LXXXIV</h4>
<p>REMOTE from the fighting line, in Akaba, during this pause, we saw
the reverse of the shield, the corruption of our enthusiasm, which made
the moral condition of the base unsatisfactory. We rejoiced when at last
we were able to escape into the clean, fresh hills about Guweira. The
early winter gave us days hot and sunny, or days overcast, with clouds
massed about the head of the plateau nine miles away, where Maulud was
keeping his watch in the mist and rain. The evenings held just enough of
chill to add delightful value to a thick cloak and a fire.</p>
<p>We waited in Guweira for news of the opening of our operation against
Tafileh, the knot of villages commanding the south end of the Dead Sea.
We planned to tackle it from west, south, and east, at once; the east
opening the ball by attacking Jurf, its nearest station on the Hejaz
line. Conduct of this attack had been trusted to Sherif Nasir, the
Fortunate. With him went Nuri Said, Jaafar’s chief of staff, commanding
some regulars, a gun, and some machine-guns. They were working from
Jefer. After three days their post came in. As usual Nasir had directed
his raid with skill and deliberation. Jurf, the objective, was a strong
station of three stone buildings with outer-works and trenches. Behind
the station was a low mound, trenched and walled, on which the Turks had
set two machine-guns and a mountain gun. Beyond the mount lay a high,
sharp ridge, the last spur of the hills which divided Jefer from
Bair.</p>
<p>The weakness of the defence lay in this ridge, for the Turks were too
few to hold both it and the knoll or station, and its crest overlooked
the railway. Nasir one night occupied the whole top of the hill without
alarm, and then cut the line above and below the station. A few minutes
later, when it was light enough to see, Nuri Said brought his mountain
gun to the edge of the ridge; and, with a third lucky shot, a direct
hit, silenced the Turkish gun beneath his view.</p>
<p>Nasir grew greatly excited: the Beni Sakhr mounted their camels,
swearing they would charge in forthwith. Nuri thought it madness while
Turkish machine-guns were still in action from trenches: but his words
had no effect upon the Bedu. In desperation he opened a rattling fire
with all he had against the Turkish position, and the Beni Sakhr swept
round the foot of the main ridge and up over the knoll in a flash. When
they saw this camel-horde racing at them, the Turks flung away their
rifles and fled into the station. Only two Arabs were fatally hurt.</p>
<p>Nuri ran down to the knoll. The Turkish gun was undamaged. He slewed
it round and discharged it point blank into the ticket office. The Beni
Sakhr mob yelled with joy to see the wood and stones flying, jumped
again on their camels and loped into the station just as the enemy
surrendered. Nearly two hundred Turks, including seven officers,
survived as our prisoners.</p>
<p>The Bedu became rich: besides the weapons, there were twenty-five
mules, and in the siding seven trucks of delicacies for the officers’
messes of Medina. There were things the tribesmen had only heard of, and
things they had never heard of: they were supremely happy. Even the
unfortunate regulars got a share, and were able once more to enjoy
olives, sesame paste, dried apricot, and other sweet or pickled products
of their native, half-forgotten, Syria.</p>
<p>Nuri Said had artificial tastes, and rescued tinned meats and liquors
from the wilder men. There was one whole truck of tobacco. As the
Howeitat did not smoke, it was divided between the Beni Sakhr and the
regulars. By its loss the Medina garrison became tobacco-less: their sad
plight later so worked on Feisal, a confirmed smoker, that he loaded
some pack-camels with cheap cigarettes and drove them into Tebuk with
his compliments.</p>
<p>After the looting, the engineers fired charges under the two engines,
against the water-tower, in the pump, and between the points of the
sidings. They burned the captured trucks and damaged a bridge; but
perfunctorily, for, as usual after victory, everyone was too loaded and
too hot to care for altruistic labour. They camped behind the station,
and about midnight had an alarm, when the noise and lights of a train
came from the south and halted, clearly with foreknowledge, by the break
of the evening before. Auda sent scouts to report.</p>
<p>Before they had returned a solitary sergeant walked into Nasir’s camp
as a volunteer for the Sherif’s army. He had been sent out by the Turks
to explore the station. His story was that there were only sixty men and
a mountain gun on the relief train, which, if he went back with smooth
news, might be surprised without a shot fired. Nasir called Auda, who
called the Howeitat, and they went off silently to lay the trap: but
just before they got there our scouts decided to do their unaided best,
and opened fire against the coaches. In fear, the engine reversed and
rolled the train back, unhurt, to Maan. It was the only sorrow of
Jurf.</p>
<p>After this raid the weather once more broke. For three successive
days came falls of snow. Nasir’s force with difficulty regained the
tents at Jefer. This plateau about Maan lay between three and five
thousand feet above sea level, open to all winds from north and east.
They blew from Central Asia, or from Caucasus, terribly over the great
desert to these low hills of Edom, against which their first fury broke.
The surplus bitterness lipped the crest and made a winter, quite severe
of its degree, below in Judæa and Sinai.</p>
<p>Outside Beersheba and Jerusalem the British found it cold; but our
Arabs fled there to get warm. Unhappily the British supply staff
realized too late that we were fighting in a little Alp. They would not
give us tents for one-quarter of our troops, nor serge clothing, nor
boots, nor blankets enough to issue two to each man of the mountain
garrisons. Our soldiers, if they neither deserted nor died, existed in
an aching misery which froze the hope out of them.</p>
<p>According to our plan the good news of Jurf was to send the Arabs of
Petra, under Sherif Abd el Mayin, at once up their hills into the forest
towards Shobek. It was an uncanny march in the hoar mist, that of these
frozen-footed peasants in their sheepskins, up and down sharp valleys
and dangerous hill-sides, out of whose snow-drifts the heavy trunks of
junipers, grudging in leaves, jutted like castings in grey iron. The ice
and frost broke down the animals, and many of the men; yet these hardy
highlanders, used to being too cold throughout their winter, persisted
in the advance.</p>
<p>The Turks heard of them as they struggled slowly nearer, and fled
from the caves and shelters among the trees to the branch railhead,
littering the roads of their panic with cast baggage and equipment.</p>
<p>Railhead of the forest railway, with its temporary sheds, was
commanded from low ridges by the Arab gun-fire, and no better than a
trap. The tribesmen, in a pack, tore the enemy to pieces as they ran out
from their burning and falling walls. One disciplined company of proper
troops, under an Albanian officer, fought their way to the main line;
but the Arabs killed or took the others, and also the stores in Shobek,
the old Crusader fort of Monreale, poised high on a chalk cone above its
winding valley. Abd el Mayein put his headquarters there, and sent word
to Nasir. Mastur, too, was told. He drew his Motalga horse and foot from
the comfort of their tents in the sunny depths of Arabia and with them
climbed the hill-pass eastward towards Tafileh.</p>
<p>However, the advantage lay with Nasir, who leaped in one day from
Jefer, and after a whirlwind night appeared at dawn on the rocky brink
of the ravine in which Tafileh hid, and summoned it to surrender on pain
of bombardment: an idle threat, for Nuri Said with the guns had gone
back to Guweira. There were only one hundred and eighty Turks in the
village, but they had supporters in the Muhaisin, a clan of the
peasantry; not for love so much as because Dhiab, the vulgar headman of
another faction, had declared for Feisal. So they shot up at Nasir a
stream of ill-directed bullets.</p>
<p>The Howeitat spread out along the cliffs to return the peasants’
fire. This manner of going displeased Auda, the old lion, who raged that
a mercenary village folk should dare to resist their secular masters,
the Abu Tayi. So he jerked his halter, cantered his mare down the path,
and rode out plain to view beneath the easternmost houses of the
village. There he reined in, and shook a hand at them, booming in his
wonderful voice: ‘Dogs, do you not know Auda?’ When they realized it was
that implacable son of war their hearts failed them, and an hour later
Sherif Nasir in the town-house was sipping tea with his guest the
Turkish Governor, trying to console him for the sudden change of
fortune.</p>
<p>At dark Mastur rode in. His Motalga looked blackly at their blood
enemies the Abu Tayi, lolling in the best houses. The two Sherifs
divided up the place, to keep their unruly followers apart. They had
little authority to mediate, for by passage of time Nasir was nearly
adopted into the Abu Tayi, and Mastur into the Jazi.</p>
<p>When morning came the factions were bickering; and the day passed
anxiously; for besides these blood enemies, the Muhaisin were fighting
for authority among the villagers, and further complications developed
in two stranger elements: one a colony of freebooting Senussi from North
Africa, who had been intruded by the Turks into some rich, but
half-derelict plough-land; the other a plaintive and active suburb of a
thousand Armenians, survivors of an infamous deportation by the Young
Turks in 1915.</p>
<p>The people of Tafileh went in deadly fear of the future. We were, as
usual, short of food and short of transport, and they would remedy
neither ill. They had wheat or barley in their bins; but hid it. They
had pack-animals, asses and mules in abundance; but drove them away for
safety. They could have driven us away too, but were, fortunately for
us, short of the sticking point. Incuriousness was the most potent ally
of our imposed order; for Eastern government rested not so much on
consent or force, as on the common supinity, hebetude, lack-a-daisiness,
which gave a minority undue effect.</p>
<p>Feisal had delegated command of this push towards the Dead Sea to his
young half-brother Zeid. It was Zeid’s first office in the north, and he
set out eager with hope. As adviser he had Jaafar Pasha, our general.
His infantry, gunners and machine-gunners stuck, for lack of food, at
Petra; but Zeid himself and Jaafar rode on to Tafileh.</p>
<p>Things were almost at a break. Auda affected a magnanimity very
galling to the Motalga boys, Metaab and Annad, sons of Abtan, whom
Auda’s son had killed. They, lithe, definite, self-conscious figures,
began to talk big about revenge — tom-tits threatening a hawk. Auda
declared he would whip them in the market-place if they were rude. This
was very well, but their followers were two to every man of his, and we
should have the village in a blaze. The young fellows, with Rahail, my
ruffler, went flaunting in every street.</p>
<p>Zeid thanked and paid Auda and sent him back to his desert. The
enlightened heads of the Muhaisin had to go as forced guests to Feisal’s
tent. Dhiab, their enemy, was our friend: we remembered regretfully the
adage that the best allies of a violently-successful new regime were not
its partisans, but its opponents. By Zeid’s plenty of gold the economic
situation improved. We appointed an officer-governor and organized our
five villages for further attack.</p>
