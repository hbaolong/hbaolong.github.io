<h4 id="chapter-xlvi">CHAPTER XLVI</h4>
<p>MEANWHILE we would stay with Ali abu Fitna, moving gently northward
with him towards Nebk, where Auda would tell all the Abu Tayi to
collect. He would be back from Nuri before they were united. This was
the business, and we laded six bags of gold into Auda’s saddle-bags, and
off he went. Afterwards the chiefs of the Fitenna waited on us, and said
they were honoured to feast us twice a day, forenoon and sunset, so long
as we remained with them; and they meant what they said. Howeitat
hospitality was unlimited — no three-day niggardliness for them of the
nominal desert law — and importunate, and left us no honourable escape
from the entirety of the nomad’s dream of well-being.</p>
<p>Each morning, between eight and ten, a little group of blood mares
under an assortment of imperfect saddlery would come to our camping
place, and on them Nasir, Nesib, Zeki and I would mount, and with
perhaps a dozen of our men on foot would move solemnly across the valley
by the sandy paths between the bushes. Our horses were led by our
servants, since it would be immodest to ride free or fast. So eventually
we would reach the tent which was to be our feast-hall for that time;
each family claiming us in turn, and bitterly offended if Zaal, the
adjudicator, preferred one out of just order.</p>
<p>As we arrived, the dogs would rush out at us, and be driven off by
onlookers — always a crowd had collected round the chosen tent — and we
stepped in under the ropes to its guest half, made very large for the
occasion and carefully dressed with its wall-curtain on the sunny side
to give us the shade. The bashful host would murmur and vanish again out
of sight. The tribal rugs, lurid red things from Beyrout, were ready for
us, arranged down the partition curtain, along the back wall and across
the dropped end, so that we sat down on three sides of an open dusty
space. We might be fifty men in all.</p>
<p>The host would reappear, standing by the pole; our local
fellow-guests, el Dheilan, Zaal and other sheikhs, reluctantly let
themselves be placed on the rugs between us, sharing our elbow-room on
the packsaddles, padded with folded felt rugs, over which we leaned. The
front of the tent was cleared, and the dogs were frequently chased away
by excited children, who ran across the empty space pulling yet smaller
children after them. Their clothes were less as their years were less,
and their pot-bodies rounder. The smallest infants of all, out of their
fly-black eyes, would stare at the company, gravely balanced on spread
legs, stark-naked, sucking their thumbs and pushing out expectant
bellies towards us.</p>
<p>Then would follow an awkward pause, which our friends would try to
cover, by showing us on its perch the household hawk (when possible a
sea-bird taken young on the Red Sea coast) or their watch-cockerel, or
their greyhound. Once a tame ibex was dragged in for our admiration:
another time an oryx. When these interests were exhausted they would try
and find a small talk to distract us from the household noises, and from
noticing the urgent whispered cookery-directions wafted through the
dividing curtain with a powerful smell of boiled fat and drifts of tasty
meat-smoke.</p>
<p>After a silence the host or a deputy would come forward and whisper,
‘Black or white?’ an invitation for us to choose coffee or tea. Nasir
would always answer ‘Black’, and the slave would be beckoned forward
with the beaked coffee-pot in one hand, and three or four clinking cups
of white ware in the other. He would dash a few drops of coffee into the
uppermost cup, and proffer it to Nasir; then pour the second for me, and
the third for Nesib; and pause while we turned the cups about in our
hands, and sucked them carefully, to get appreciatively from them the
last richest drop.</p>
<p>As soon as they were empty his hand was stretched to clap them
noisily one above the other, and toss them out with a lesser flourish
for the next guest in order, and so on round the assembly till all had
drunk. Then back to Nasir again. This second cup would be tastier than
the first, partly because the pot was yielding deeper from the brew,
partly because of the heel-taps of so many previous drinkers present in
the cups; whilst the third and fourth rounds, if the serving of the meat
delayed so long, would be of surprising flavour.</p>
<p>However, at last, two men came staggering through the thrilled crowd,
carrying the rice and meat on a tinned copper tray or shallow bath, five
feet across, set like a great brazier on a foot. In the tribe there was
only this one food-bowl of the size, and an incised inscription ran
round it in florid Arabic characters: ‘To the glory of God, and in trust
of mercy at the last, the property of His poor suppliant, Auda abu
Tayi’. It was borrowed by the host who was to entertain us for the time;
and, since my urgent brain and body made me wakeful, from my blankets in
the first light I would see the dish going across country, and by
marking down its goal would know where we were to feed that day.</p>
<p>The bowl was now brim-full, ringed round its edge by white rice in an
embankment a foot wide and six inches deep, filled with legs and ribs of
mutton till they toppled over. It needed two or three victims to make in
the centre a dressed pyramid of meat such as honour prescribed. The
centre-pieces were the boiled, upturned heads, propped on their severed
stumps of necks, so that the ears, brown like old leaves, flapped out on
the rice surface. The jaws gaped emptily upward, pulled open to show the
hollow throat with the tongue, still pink, clinging to the lower teeth;
and the long incisors whitely crowned the pile, very prominent above the
nostrils’ pricking hair and the lips which sneered away blackly from
them.</p>
<p>This load was set down on the soil of the cleared space between us,
where it steamed hotly, while a procession of minor helpers bore small
cauldrons and copper vats in which the cooking had been done. From them,
with much-bruised bowls of enamelled iron, they ladled out over the main
dish all the inside and outside of the sheep; little bits of yellow
intestine, the white tail-cushion of fat, brown muscles and meat and
bristly skin, all swimming in the liquid butter and grease of the
seething. The bystanders watched anxiously, muttering satisfactions when
a very juicy scrap plopped out.</p>
<p>The fat was scalding. Every now and then a man would drop his baler
with an exclamation, and plunge his burnt fingers, not reluctantly, in
his mouth to cool them: but they persevered till at last their scooping
rang loudly on the bottoms of the pots; and, with a gesture of triumph,
they fished out the intact livers from their hiding place in the gravy
and topped the yawning jaws with them.</p>
<p>Two raised each smaller cauldron and tilted it, letting the liquid
splash down upon the meat till the rice-crater was full, and the loose
grains at the edge swam in the abundance: and yet they poured, till,
amid cries of astonishment from us, it was running over, and a little
pool congealing in the dust. That was the final touch of splendour, and
the host called us to come and eat.</p>
<p>We feigned a deafness, as manners demanded: at last we heard him, and
looked surprised at one another, each urging his fellow to move first;
till Nasir rose coyly, and after him we all came forward to sink on one
knee round the tray, wedging in and cuddling up till the twenty-two for
whom there was barely space were grouped around the food. We turned back
our right sleeves to the elbow, and, taking lead from Nasir with a low
‘In the name of God the merciful, the loving-kind’, we dipped
together.</p>
<p>The first dip, for me, at least, was always cautious, since the
liquid fat was so hot that my unaccustomed fingers could seldom bear it:
and so I would toy with an exposed and cooling lump of meat till others’
excavations had drained my rice-segment. We would knead between the
fingers (not soiling the palm), neat balls of rice and fat and liver and
meat cemented by gentle pressure, and project them by leverage of the
thumb from the crooked fore-finger into the mouth. With the right trick
and the right construction the little lump held together and came clean
off the hand; but when surplus butter and odd fragments clung, cooling,
to the fingers, they had to be licked carefully to make the next effort
slip easier away.</p>
<p>As the meat pile wore down (nobody really cared about rice: flesh was
the luxury) one of the chief Howeitat eating with us would draw his
dagger, silver hilted, set with turquoise, a signed masterpiece of
Mohammed ibn Zari, of Jauf,* and would cut criss-cross from the larger
bones long diamonds of meat easily torn up between the fingers; for it
was necessarily boiled very tender, since all had to be disposed of with
the right hand which alone was honourable.</p>
<p>Our host stood by the circle, encouraging the appetite with pious
ejaculations. At top speed we twisted, tore, cut and stuffed: never
speaking, since conversation would insult a meal’s quality, though it
was proper to smile thanks when an intimate guest passed a select
fragment, or when Mohammed el Dheilan gravely handed over a huge barren
bone with a blessing. On such occasions I would return the compliment
with some hideous impossible lump of guts, a flippancy which rejoiced
the Howeitat, but which the gracious, aristocratic Nasir saw with
disapproval.</p>
<p>At length some of us were nearly filled, and began to play and pick;
glancing sideways at the rest till they too grew slow, and at last
ceased eating, elbow on knee, the hand hanging down from the wrist over
the tray edge to drip, while the fat, butter and scattered grains of
rice cooled into a stiff white grease which gummed the fingers together.
When all had stopped, Nasir meaningly cleared his throat, and we rose up
together in haste with an explosive ‘God requite it you, O host’, to
group ourselves outside among the tent-ropes while the next twenty
guests inherited our leaving.</p>
<p>Those of us who were nice would go to the end of the tent where the
flap of the roof-cloth, beyond the last poles, dropped down as an end
curtain; and on this clan handkerchief (whose coarse goat-hair mesh was
pliant and glossy with much use) would scrape the thickest of the fat
from the hands. Then we would make back to our seats, and re-take them
sighingly; while the slaves, leaving aside their portion, the skulls of
the sheep, would come round our rank with a wooden bowl of water, and a
coffee-cup as dipper, to splash over our fingers, while we rubbed them
with the tribal soap-cake.</p>
<p>Meantime the second and third sittings by the dish were having their
turn, and there would be one more cup of coffee, or a glass of
syrup-like tea; and at last the horses would be brought and we would
slip out to them, and mount, with a quiet blessing to the hosts as we
passed by. When our backs were turned the children would run in disorder
upon the ravaged dish, tear our gnawed bones from one another, and
escape into the open with valuable fragments to be devoured in security
behind some distant bush: while the watchdogs of all the camp prowled
round snapping, and the master of the tent fed the choicest offal to his
greyhound.</p>
