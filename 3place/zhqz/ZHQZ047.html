<h4 id="chapter-xxxvi">CHAPTER XXXVI</h4>
<p>DESPITE his kindness and charm, I could not like Abdullah or his
camp: perhaps because I was not sociable, and these people had no
personal solitude: perhaps because their good humour showed me the
futility of my more than Palomides’ pains, not merely to seem better
than myself, but to make others better. Whereas nothing was futile in
the atmosphere of higher thinking and responsibility which ruled at
Feisal’s. Abdulla passed his merry day in the big cool tent accessible
only to friends, limiting suppliants or new adherents or the hearing of
disputes to one public session in the afternoon. For the rest he read
the papers, ate carefully, slept. Especially he played games, either
chess with his staff or practical jokes with Mohammed Hassan. Mohammed,
nominally Muedhdhin, was really court fool. A tiresome old fool I found
him, as my illness left me less even than usual in jesting mood.</p>
<p>Abdulla and his friends, Shakir, Fauzan, and the two sons of Hamza
among the Sherifs, with Sultan el Abbud and Hoshan, from the Ateiba, and
ibn Mesfer, the guest-master, would spend much of the day and all the
evening hours tormenting Mohammed Hassan. They stabbed him with thorns,
stoned him, dropped sun-heated pebbles down his back, set him on fire.
Sometimes the jest would be elaborate, as when they laid a powder trail
under the rugs, and lured Mohammed Hassan to sit on its end. Once
Abdulla shot a coffee-pot off his head thrice from twenty yards, and
then rewarded his long-suffering servility with three months’ pay.</p>
<p>Abdulla would sometimes ride a little, or shoot a little, and return
exhausted to his tent for massage; and afterwards reciters would be
introduced to soothe his aching head. He was fond of Arabic verses and
exceptionally well read. The local poets found him a profitable
audience. He was also interested in history and letters, and would have
grammatical disputations in his tent and adjudge money prizes.</p>
<p>He affected to have no care for the Hejaz situation, regarding the
autonomy of the Arabs as assured by the promises of Great Britain to his
father, and leaning at ease against this prop. I longed to tell him that
the half-witted old man had obtained from us no concrete or unqualified
undertaking of any sort, and that their ship might founder on the bar of
his political stupidity; but that would have been to give away my
English masters, and the mental tug of war between honesty and loyalty,
after swaying a while, settled again expediently into deadlock.</p>
<p>Abdulla professed great interest in the war in Europe, and studied it
closely in the Press. He was also acquainted with Western politics, and
had learned by rote the courts and ministries of Europe, even to the
name of the Swiss President. I remarked again how much the comfortable
circumstance that we still had a King made for the reputation of England
in this world of Asia. Ancient and artificial societies like this of the
Sherifs and feudal chieftains of Arabia found a sense of honourable
security when dealing with us in such proof that the highest place in
our state was not a prize for merit or ambition.</p>
<p>Time slowly depressed my first, favourable, opinion of Abdulla’s
character. His constant ailments, which once aroused compassion, became
fitter for contempt when their causes were apparent in laziness and
self-indulgence, and when he was seen to cherish them as occupations of
his too-great leisure. His casual attractive fits of arbitrariness now
seemed feeble tyranny disguised as whims; his friendliness became
caprice; his good humour love of pleasure. The leaven of insincerity
worked through all the fibres of his being. Even his simplicity appeared
false upon experience; and inherited religious prejudice was allowed
rule over the keenness of his mind because it was less trouble to him
than unchartered thought. His brain often betrayed its intricate
pattern, disclosing idea twisted tightly over idea into a strong cord of
design; and thus his indolence marred his scheming, too. The webs were
constantly unravelling through his carelessness in leaving them
unfinished. Yet they never separated into straight desires, or grew into
effective desires. Always he watched out of the corner of his bland and
open eye our returns to his innocent-sounding questions, reading an
insect-subtlety of significant meaning into every hesitation or
uncertainty or honest mistake.</p>
<p>One day I entered to find him sitting upright and wide-eyed with a
spot of red in either cheek. Sergeant Prost, his old tutor, had just
come from Colonel Bremond, innocent bearer of a letter which pointed out
how the British were wrapping up the Arabs on all sides — at Aden, at
Gaza, at Bagdad — and hoped that Abdulla realized his situation. He
asked hotly what I thought of it. In answer, I fell back on artifice,
and replied in a pretty phrase that I hoped he would suspect our honesty
when he found us backbiting our allies in private letters. The
delicately poisoned Arabic pleased him, and he paid us the edged
compliment of saying that he knew we were sincere, since otherwise we
would not be represented at Jeddah by Colonel Wilson. There,
characteristically, his subtlety hanged itself, not perceiving the
double subtlety which negatived him. He did not understand that honesty
might be the best-paying cat’s paw of rogues, and Wilson, too, downright
readily or quickly to suspect evil in the dignitaries above him.</p>
<p>Wilson never told even a half-truth. If instructed to inform the King
diplomatically that the subsidy of the month could not at present be
increased, he would ring up Mecca and say ‘Lord, Lord, there is no more
money’. As for lying, he was not merely incapable of it, but also shrewd
enough to know that it was the worst gambit against players whose whole
life had passed in a mist of deceits, and whose perceptions were of the
finest. The Arab leaders showed a completeness of instinct, a reliance
upon intuition, the unperceived foreknown, which left our centrifugal
minds gasping. Like women, they understood and judged quickly,
effortlessly, unreasonably. It almost seemed as though the Oriental
exclusion of woman from politics had conferred her particular gifts upon
the men. Some of the speed and secrecy of our victory, and its
regularity, might perhaps be ascribed to this double endowment’s
offsetting and emphasizing the rare feature that from end to end of it
there was nothing female in the Arab movement, but the camels.</p>
<p>The outstanding figure of Abdulla’s entourage was Sherif Shakir, a
man of twenty-nine, and companion since boyhood of the four Emirs. His
mother was Circassian, as had been his grandmother. From them he
obtained his fair complexion; but the flesh of his face was torn away by
smallpox. From its white ruin two restless eyes looked out, very bright
and big; for the faintness of his eyelashes and eyebrows made his stare
directly disconcerting. His figure was tall, slim, almost boyish from
the continual athletic activity of the man. His sharp, decided, but
pleasant voice frayed out if he shouted. His manner while delightfully
frank, was abrupt, indeed imperious; with a humour as cracked as his
cackling laugh.</p>
<p>This bursting freedom of speech seemed to respect nothing on earth
except King Hussein: towards himself he exacted deference, more so than
did Abdulla, who was always playing tricks with his companions, the bevy
of silk-clad fellows who came about him when he would be easy. Shakir
joined wildly in the sport, but would smartingly punish a liberty. He
dressed simply, but very cleanly, and, like Abdulla, spent public hours
with toothpick and toothstick. He took no interest in books and never
wearied his head with meditation, but was intelligent and interesting in
talk. He was devout, but hated Mecca, and played backgammon while
Abdulla read the Koran. Yet by fits he would pray interminably.</p>
<p>In war he was the man at arms. His feats made him the darling of the
tribes. He, in turn, described himself as a Bedawi, and an Ateibi, and
imitated them. He wore his black hair in plaits down each side of his
face, and kept it glossy with butter, and strong by frequent washing in
camel urine. He encouraged nits, in deference to the Beduin proverb that
a deserted head showed an ungenerous mind: and wore the brîm, a plaited
girdle of thin leathern thongs wrapped three or four times round the
loins to confine and support the belly. He owned splendid horses and
camels: was considered the finest rider in Arabia: ready for a match
with anyone.</p>
<p>Shakir gave me the sense that he preferred a fit of energy to
sustained effort: but there was balance and shrewdness behind his mad
manner. Sherif Hussein had used him on embassies to Cairo before the
war, to arrange private business with the Khedive of Egypt. The Beduin
figure must have looked strange in the stucco splendour of the Abdin.
Abdulla had unlimited admiration for Shakir and tried to see the world
with his eyes of gay carelessness. Between them they seriously
complicated my mission to Wadi Ais.</p>
