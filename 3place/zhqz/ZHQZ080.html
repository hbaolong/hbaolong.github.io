<h4 id="chapter-lxi">CHAPTER LXI</h4>
<p>XOCTOBER, accordingly, was a month of anticipation for us, in the
knowledge that Allenby, with Bols and Dawnay, was planning to attack the
Gaza- Beersheba line; while the Turks, a quite small army strongly
entrenched, with excellent lateral communications, had been puffed up by
successive victories to imagine that all British generals were
incompetent to keep what their troops had won for them by dint of sheer
hard fighting.</p>
<p>They deceived themselves. Allenby’s coming had re-made the English.
His breadth of personality swept away the mist of private or
departmental jealousies behind which Murray and his men had worked.
General Lynden Bell made way for General Bols, Allenby’s chief of staff
in France, a little, quick, brave, pleasant man; a tactical soldier,
perhaps, but principally an admirable and effaced foil to Allenby, who
used to relax himself on Bols. Unfortunately, neither of them had the
power of choosing men; but Chetwode’s judgement completed them with Guy
Dawnay as third member of the staff.</p>
<p>Bols had never an opinion, nor any knowledge. Dawnay was mainly
intellect. He lacked the eagerness of Bols, and the calm drive and human
understanding of Allenby, who was the man the men worked for, the image
we worshipped. Dawnay’s cold, shy mind gazed upon our efforts with bleak
eye, always thinking, thinking. Beneath this mathematical surface he hid
passionate many-sided convictions, a reasoned scholarship in higher
warfare, and the brilliant bitterness of a judgement disappointed with
us, and with life.</p>
<p>He was the least professional of soldiers, a banker who read Greek
history, a strategist unashamed, and a burning poet with strength over
daily things. During the war he had had the grief of planning the attack
at Suvla (spoiled by incompetent tacticians) and the battle for Gaza. As
each work of his was ruined he withdrew further into the hardnesses of
frosted pride, for he was of the stuff of fanatics.</p>
<p>Allenby, by not seeing his dissatisfaction, broke into him; and
Dawnay replied by giving for the Jerusalem advance all the talent which
he abundantly possessed. A cordial union of two such men made the Turks’
position hopeless from the outset.</p>
<p>Their divergent characters were mirrored in the intricate plan. Gaza
had been entrenched on a European scale with line after line of defences
in reserve. It was so obviously the enemy’s strongest point, that the
British higher command had twice chosen it for frontal attack. Allenby,
fresh from France, insisted that any further assault must be delivered
by overwhelming numbers of men and guns, and their thrust maintained by
enormous quantities of all kinds of transport. Bols nodded his assent.
Dawnay was not the man to fight a straight battle. He sought to destroy
the enemy’s strength with the least fuss. Like a master politician he
used the bluff Chief as a cloak for the last depth of justifiable
slimness. He advised a drive at the far end of the Turkish line, near
Beersheba. To make his victory cheap he wanted the enemy main force
behind Gaza, which would be best secured if the British concentration
was hidden so that the Turks would believe the flank attack to be a
shallow feint. Bols nodded his assent.</p>
<p>Consequently the movements were made in great secrecy; but Dawnay
found an ally in his intelligence staff who advised him to go beyond
negative precautions, and to give the enemy specific (and speciously
wrong) information of the plans he matured.</p>
<p>This ally was Meinertzhagen, a student of migrating birds drifted
into soldiering, whose hot immoral hatred of the enemy expressed itself
as readily in trickery as in violence. He persuaded Dawnay: Allenby
reluctantly agreed: Bols assented, and the work began.</p>
<p>Meinertzhagen knew no half measures. He was logical, an idealist of
the deepest, and so possessed by his convictions that he was willing to
harness evil to the chariot of good. He was a strategist, a geographer,
and a silent laughing masterful man; who took as blithe a pleasure in
deceiving his enemy (or his friend) by some unscrupulous jest, as in
spattering the brains of a cornered mob of Germans one by one with his
African knob-kerri. His instincts were abetted by an immensely powerful
body and a savage brain, which chose the best way to its purpose,
unhampered by doubt or habit. Meiner thought out false Army papers,
elaborate and confidential, which to a trained staff officer would
indicate wrong positions for Allenby’s main formation, a wrong direction
of the coming attack, and a date some days too late. This information
was led up to by careful hints given in code wireless messages. When he
knew the enemy had picked these up, Meinertzhagen rode out with his note
books, on reconnaissance. He pushed forward until the enemy saw him. In
the ensuing gallop he lost all his loose equipment and very nearly
himself, but was rewarded by seeing the enemy reserves held behind Gaza
and their whole preparations swung towards the coast and made less
urgent. Simultaneously, an Army order by Ali Fuad Pasha cautioned his
staff against carrying documents into the line.</p>
<p>We on the Arab front were very intimate with the enemy. Our Arab
officers had been Turkish officers, and knew every leader on the other
side personally. They had suffered the same training, thought the same,
took the same point of view. By practising modes of approach upon the
Arabs we could explore the Turks: understand, almost get inside, their
minds. Relation between us and them was universal, for the civil
population of the enemy area was wholly ours without pay or persuasion.
In consequence our intelligence service was the widest, fullest and most
certain imaginable.</p>
<p>We knew, better than Allenby, the enemy hollowness, and the magnitude
of the British resources. We under-estimated the crippling effect of
Allenby’s too plentiful artillery, and the cumbrous intricacy of his
infantry and cavalry, which moved only with rheumatic slowness. We hoped
Allenby would be given a month’s fine weather; and, in that case,
expected to see him take, not merely Jerusalem, but Haifa too, sweeping
the Turks in ruin through the hills.</p>
<p>Such would be our moment, and we needed to be ready for it in the
spot where our weight and tactics would be least expected and most
damaging. For my eyes the centre of attraction was Deraa, the junction
of the Jerusalem-Haifa-Damascus-Medina railways, the navel of the
Turkish Armies in Syria, the common point of all their fronts; and, by
chance, an area in which lay great untouched reserves of Arab fighting
men, educated and armed by Feisal from Akaba. We could there use Rualla,
Serahin, Serdiyeh, Khoreisha; and, far stronger than tribes, the settled
peoples of Hauran and Jebel Druse.</p>
<p>I pondered for a while whether we should not call up all these
adherents and tackle the Turkish communications in force. We were
certain, with any management, of twelve thousand men: enough to rush
Deraa, to smash all the railway lines, even to take Damascus by
surprise. Any one of these things would make the position of the
Beersheba army critical: and my temptation to stake our capital
instantly upon the issue was very sore.</p>
<p>Not for the first or last time service to two masters irked me. I was
one of Allenby’s officers, and in his confidence: in return, he expected
me to do the best I could for him. I was Feisal’s adviser, and Feisal
relied upon the honesty and competence of my advice so far as often to
take it without argument. Yet I could not explain to Allenby the whole
Arab situation, nor disclose the full British plan to Feisal.</p>
<p>The local people were imploring us to come. Sheikh Talal el
Hareidhin, leader of the hollow country about Deraa, sent in repeated
messages that, with a few of our riders as proof of Arab support, he
would give us Deraa. Such an exploit would have done the Allenby
business, but was not one which Feisal could scrupulously afford unless
he had a fair hope of then establishing himself there. Deraa’s sudden
capture, followed by a retreat, would have involved the massacre, or the
ruin of all the splendid peasantry of the district.</p>
<p>They could only rise once, and their effort on that occasion must be
decisive. To call them out now was to risk the best asset Feisal held
for eventual success, on the speculation that Allenby’s first attack
would sweep the enemy before it, and that the month of November would be
rainless, favourable to a rapid advance.</p>
<p>I weighed the English army in my mind, and could not honestly assure
myself of them. The men were often gallant fighters, but their generals
as often gave away in stupidity what they had gained in ignorance.
Allenby was quite untried, sent to us with a not-blameless record from
France, and his troops had broken down in and been broken by the Murray
period. Of course, we were fighting for an Allied victory, and since the
English were the leading partners, the Arabs would have, in the last
resort, to be sacrificed for them. But was it the last resort? The war
generally was going neither well nor very ill, and it seemed as though
there might be time for another try next year. So I decided to postpone
the hazard for the Arabs’ sake.</p>
