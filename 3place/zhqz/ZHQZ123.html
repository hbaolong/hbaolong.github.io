<h4 id="chapter-cxii">CHAPTER CXII</h4>
<p>RELUCTANTLY we pulled ourselves together for another day of effort,
called up the army, and moved in a huge straggle through Mezerib
station. Our fires had burned out, and the place stood dishevelled.
Young and myself leisurely laid tulips, while the troops melted into
broken ground towards Remthe, to be out of sight of both Deraa and
Shehab. Turkish aeroplanes were humming overhead, looking for us, so we
sent our peasants back through Mezerib for their villages. Consequently,
the airmen reported that we were very numerous, possibly eight or nine
thousand strong, and that our centrifugal movements seemed to be
directed towards every direction at once.</p>
<p>To increase their wonderment, the French gunners’ long-fused charge
blew up the water-tower at Mezerib, loudly, hours after we had passed.
The Germans were marching out of Shehab for Deraa, at the moment, and
the inexplicable shock sent these humourless ones back there on guard
till late afternoon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we were far away, plodding steadily towards Nisib, whose
hill-top we reached about four in the afternoon. We gave the mounted
infantry a short rest, while we moved our gunners and machine-guns to
the crest of the first ridge, from which the ground fell away hollowly
to the railway station.</p>
<p>We posted the guns there in shelter, and asked them to open
deliberately upon the station buildings at two thousand yards. Pisani’s
sections worked in emulation so that, before long, ragged holes appeared
in the roofs and sheds. At the same time we pushed our machine-gunners
forward on the left, to fire long bursts against the trenches, which
returned a hot obstinate fire. However our troops had natural shelter
and the advantage of the afternoon sun behind their backs. So we
suffered no hurt. Nor did the enemy. Of course, all this was just a
game, and the capture of the station not in our plan. Our real objective
was the great bridge north of the village. The ridge below our feet
curved out in a long horn to this work, serving as one bank of the
valley which it was built to span. The village stood on the other bank.
The Turks held the bridge by means of a small redoubt, and maintained
touch with it by riflemen posted in the village under cover of its
walls.</p>
<p>We turned two of Pisani’s guns and six machine-guns on the small but
deeply-dug bridge-post, hoping to force its defenders out. Five
machine-guns directed their fire on the village. In fifteen minutes its
elders were out with us, very much perturbed. Nuri put, as the condition
of cease-fire, their instant ejectment of the Turks from the houses.
They promised. So station and bridge were divided.</p>
<p>We redoubled against these. The firing from the four wings became
violent, thanks to our twenty-five machine-guns, the Turks also being
plentifully supplied. At last we put all four of Pisani’s guns against
the redoubt; and, after a few salvoes, thought we saw its guard slipping
from their battered trenches through the bridge into cover of the
railway embankment.</p>
<p>This embankment was twenty feet high. If the bridge-guard chose to
defend their bridge through its arches, they would be in a costly
position. However, we reckoned that the attraction of their fellows in
the station would draw them away. I told off the half of my bodyguard
carrying explosives, to move along the machine-gun crest till within a
stone’s throw of the redoubt.</p>
<p>It was a noble evening, yellow, mild and indescribably peaceful; a
foil to our incessant cannonade. The declining light shone down the
angle of the ridges, its soft rays modelling them and their least
contour in a delicate complexity of planes. Then the sun sank another
second, and the surface became shadow, out of which for a moment there
rose, starkly, the innumerable flints strewing it; each western
(reflecting) facet tipped like a black diamond with flame.</p>
<p>A very unfit afternoon for dying, seemed to think my men: for the
first time their nerves failed, and they refused to quit their shelter
for the enemy’s clattering bullets. They were tired, and their camels so
marched out they could only walk: also they knew that one bullet in the
blasting gelatine would send them sky-high.</p>
<p>A try to stir them by jest failed; at last I cast them off, choosing
only Hemeid, the young and timid one amongst them, to come up with me on
the hill-top. He shook like a man in a sick dream, but followed quietly.
We rode down the ridge to its furthest edge, to have a close look at the
bridge.</p>
<p>Nuri Said was there, sucking his briar pipe, and cheering the
gunners, who were keeping a barrage over the darkening roads between the
bridge, the village and the station. Nuri, being happy, propounded to me
plans of attack and alternative assaults against this station, which we
did not wish to assault. We argued theory for ten minutes on the
skyline, with Hemeid wincing in his saddle as bullets, some of which
were overs, spat past us, or ricochets hummed like slow, angry bees
beside our ears. The few proper hits splashed loudly into the flints,
kicking up a chalk-dust which hung transparently for a moment in the
reflected light.</p>
<p>Nuri agreed to cover my movements to the bridge as well as he could.
Then I turned Hemeid back with my camel, to tell the rest that I would
hurt them worse than bullets if they did not follow him across the
danger-zone to meet me: for I meant to walk round till I could be sure
the bridge-post was empty.</p>
<p>While they hesitated, there came up Abdulla, the imperturbable,
improvident, adventurous, who feared nothing; and the Zaagi. They, mad
with fury that I had been let down, dashed at the shrinkers, who pounded
over the shoulder with only six bullet-scratches. The redoubt was indeed
abandoned: so we dismounted, and signalled Nuri to cease fire. In the
silence we crept discreetly through the bridge-arches, and found them
also evacuated.</p>
<p>Hurriedly we piled gun-cotton against the piers, which were about
five feet thick and twenty-five feet high; a good bridge, my
seventy-ninth, and strategically most critical, since we were going to
live opposite it at Umtaiye until Allenby came forward and relieved us.
So I had determined to leave not a stone of it in place.</p>
<p>Nuri meanwhile was hurrying the infantry, gunners and machine-gunners
down in the thickening light, towards the line, with orders to get a
mile beyond into the desert, form up into column and wait.</p>
<p>Yet the passing of so many camels over the track must take tediously
long. We sat and chafed under the bridge, matches in hand, to light at
once (despite the troops) if there was an alarm. Fortunately everything
went well, and after an hour Nuri gave me my signal. Half a minute later
(my preference for six-inch fuses!) just as I tumbled into the Turkish
redoubt, the eight hundred pounds of stuff exploded in one burst, and
the black air became sibilant with flying stones. The explosion was
numbing from my twenty yards, and must have been heard half-way to
Damascus.</p>
<p>Nuri, in great distress, sought me out. He had given the ‘all clear’
signal before learning that one company of mounted infantry was missing.
Fortunately my guards were aching for redeeming service. Talal el
Hareidhin took them with him up the hills, while Nuri and I stood by the
yawning pit which had been the bridge, and flashed an electric torch, to
give them a fixed point for their return.</p>
<p>Mahmud came back in half an hour triumphantly leading the lost unit.
We fired shots to recall the other searchers, and then rode two or three
miles into the open towards Umtaiye. The going became very broken, over
moraines of slipping dolerite: so we gladly called a halt, and lay down
in our ranks for an earned sleep.</p>
