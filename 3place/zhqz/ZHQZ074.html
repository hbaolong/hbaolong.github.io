<h4 id="chapter-lxiii">CHAPTER LXIII</h4>
<p>NEXT morning there he was, with his men, ready to join or oppose us,
as the whim went. While he hesitated Zaal arrived. Gasim’s dourness soon
clashed upon Zaal’s metallic cruelty, and the pair had high words. We
got between them before a fight could start, but enough passed to
overthrow the weak arrangement of the night. The other clans, disgusted
at Gasim’s fierceness, came to us quietly in twos and threes, as
volunteers; but begged me to make their loyalty known to Feisal before
we started.</p>
<p>Their doubts determined me to communicate at once with him, partly
that this trouble might be composed, and partly to raise camels for
carrying the explosives. To hire Dhumaniyeh camels would not be fitting;
and there were no others here. The best way was to go myself; because
while Gasim might stop a messenger, he would not dare hinder me. The two
sergeants were commended to Zaal, who swore to answer for their lives;
and off went Ahmed and myself on stripped camels, meaning to hurry to
Akaba and back.</p>
<p>We knew only the very long way by Wadi Itm. A short cut existed, but
we could find no guide to it. Vainly we searched up and down the valley;
and were in despair when a boy blurted out that we should go along the
next valley to our right. By it, after an hour, we were on a watershed
from which valleys trended away westward. They could lead only into Wadi
Itm, for there was no other drainage hereabouts through the hills to the
sea; and we raced down them, ever and again cutting at a venture across
ridges on our right into parallel tributaries, to shorten the assumed
line.</p>
<p>In the beginning it was clean sandstone country, of pleasant
rock-shapes: but as we went spines of granite, the material of the
shore, rose up in front of us, and after thirty miles of good trotting
gradient we passed, by the southern Itm, into the main valley, just
above the well of the surrender of Akaba. The journey took us only six
hours.</p>
<p>In Akaba we rode straight to Feisal’s house. My sudden return scared
him, but a word explained the little drama which was being played at
Rumm. After we had fed we took the necessary steps. The twenty baggage
camels should start up in two days with enough of Feisal’s camel-men to
transport the explosives, and a few of his personal slaves to guard
them. He would lend me Sherif Abdulla el Feir, the best of his henchmen
now in camp, as mediator. The families of the men who rode with me to
the railway should draw provisions from his stores on my
certificate.</p>
<p>Abdulla and I went off before dawn, and in the afternoon, after a
friendly ride, reached Rumm to find all safe: so anxiety was lifted.
Sherif Abdulla at once got to work. Having collected the Arabs,
including the recalcitrant Gasim, he began to smooth over their griefs
with that ready persuasiveness which was the birthmark of an Arab
leader, and which all his experience served to whet.</p>
<p>In the idleness forced on him by our absence, Lewis had explored the
cliff, and reported the springs very good for washing in; so, to get rid
of the dust and strain after my long rides, I went straight up the gully
into the face of the hill, along the ruined wall of the conduit by which
a spout of water had once run down the ledges to a Nabatæan well-house
on the valley floor. It was a climb of fifteen minutes to a tired
person, and not difficult. At the top, the waterfall, el Shellala as the
Arabs named it, was only a few yards away.</p>
<p>Its rushing noise came from my left, by a jutting bastion of cliff
over whose crimson face trailed long falling runners of green leaves.
The path skirted it in an undercut ledge. On the rock-bulge above were
clear-cut Nabathæan inscriptions, and a sunk panel incised with a
monogram or symbol. Around and about were Arab scratches, including
tribe-marks, some of which were witnesses of forgotten migrations: but
my attention was only for the splashing of water in a crevice under the
shadow of the overhanging rock.</p>
<p>From this rock a silver runlet issued into the sunlight. I looked in
to see the spout, a little thinner than my wrist, jetting out firmly
from a fissure in the roof, and falling with that clean sound into a
shallow, frothing pool, behind the step which served as entrance. The
walls and roof of the crevice dripped with moisture. Thick ferns and
grasses of the finest green made it a paradise just five feet
square.</p>
<p>Upon the water-cleansed and fragrant ledge I undressed my soiled
body, and stepped into the little basin, to taste at last a freshness of
moving air and water against my tired skin. It was deliciously cool. I
lay there quietly, letting the clear, dark red water run over me in a
ribbly stream, and rub the travel-dirt away. While I was so happy, a
grey-bearded, ragged man, with a hewn face of great power and weariness,
came slowly along the path till opposite the spring; and there he let
himself down with a sigh upon my clothes spread out over a rock beside
the path, for the sun-heat to chase out their thronging vermin.</p>
<p>He heard me and leaned forward, peering with rheumy eyes at this
white thing splashing in the hollow beyond the veil of sun-mist. After a
long stare he seemed content, and closed his eyes, groaning, ‘The love
is from God; and of God; and towards God.’</p>
<p>His low-spoken words were caught by some trick distinctly in my water
pool. They stopped me suddenly. I had believed Semites unable to use
love as a link between themselves and God, indeed, unable to conceive
such a relation except with the intellectuality of Spinoza, who loved so
rationally and sexlessly, and transcendently that he did not seek, or
rather had not permitted, a return. Christianity had seemed to me the
first creed to proclaim love in this upper world, from which the desert
and the Semite (from Moses to Zeno) had shut it out: and Christianity
was a hybrid, except in its first root not essentially Semitic.</p>
<p>Its birth in Galilee had saved it from being just one more of the
innumerable revelations of the Semite. Galilee was Syria’s non-Semitic
province, contact with which was almost uncleanness for the perfect Jew.
Like Whitechapel to London, it lay alien to Jerusalem. Christ by choice
passed his ministry in its intellectual freedom; not among the mud-huts
of a Syrian village, but in polished streets among fora and pillared
houses and rococo baths, products of an intense if very exotic
provincial and corrupt Greek civilization.</p>
<p>The people of this stranger-colony were not Greek — at least not in
the majority — but Levantines of sorts, aping a Greek culture; and in
revenge producing, not the correct banal Hellenism of the exhausted
homeland, but a tropical rankness of idea, in which the rhythmical
balance of Greek art and Greek ideality blossomed into novel shapes
tawdry with the larded passionate colours of the East.</p>
<p>Gadarene poets, stuttering their verses in the prevailing excitement,
held a mirror to the sensuality and disillusioned fatalism, passing into
disordered lust, of their age and place; from whose earthiness the
ascetic Semite religiosity perhaps caught the tang of humanity and real
love that made the distinction of Christ’s music, and fitted it to sweep
across the hearts of Europe in a fashion which Judaism and Islam could
not achieve.</p>
<p>And then Christianity had had the fortune of later architects of
genius; and in its passage through time and clime had suffered
sea-changes incomparably greater than the unchanging Jewry, from the
abstraction of Alexandrian bookishness into Latin prose, for the
mainland of Europe: and last and most terrible passing of all, when it
became Teuton, with a formal synthesis to suit our chilly disputatious
north. So remote was the Presbyterian creed from the Orthodox faith of
its first or second embodiment that, before the war, we were able to
send missionaries to persuade these softer Oriental Christians to our
presentation of a logical God.</p>
<p>Islam, too, had inevitably changed from continent to continent. It
had avoided metaphysics, except in the introspective mysticism of
Iranian devotees: but in Africa it had taken on colours of fetishism (to
express in a loose word the varied animalities of the dark continent),
and in India, it had to stoop to the legality and literalism of its
converts’ minds. In Arabia, however, it had kept a Semitic character, or
rather the Semitic character had endured through the phase of Islam (as
through all the phases of the creeds with which the town-dwellers
continually vested the simplicity of faith), expressing the monotheism
of open spaces, the pass-through-infinity of pantheism and its everyday
usefulness of an all-pervading, household God.</p>
<p>By contrast with this fixity, or with my reading of it, the old man
of Rumm loomed portentous in his brief, single sentence, and seemed to
overturn my theories of the Arab nature. In fear of a revelation, I put
an end to my bath, and advanced to recover my clothes. He shut his eyes
with his hands and groaned heavily. Tenderly I persuaded him to rise up
and let me dress, and then to come with me along the crazy path which
the camels had made in their climbing to and from the other
water-springs. He sat down by our coffee-place, where Mohammed blew up
the fire, while I sought to make him utter doctrine.</p>
<p>When the evening meal was ready we fed him, so checking for some
minutes his undercurrent of groans and broken words. Late at night, he
rose painfully to his feet and tottered deafly into the night, taking
his beliefs, if any, with him. The Howeitat told me that life-long he
had wandered among them moaning strange things, not knowing day or
night, not troubling himself for food or work or shelter. He was given
bounty of them all, as an afflicted man: but never replied a word, or
talked aloud, except when abroad by himself or alone among the sheep and
goats.</p>
