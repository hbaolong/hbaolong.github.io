<h4 id="chapter-xxvii">CHAPTER XXVII</h4>
<p>PROFITABLE rumours excited the army, which began to trickle off
northward soon after midnight. At dawn we rallied the various
contingents on Wadi Miya, twelve miles south of the town, and advanced
on it in order, meeting a few scattered Turks, of whom one party put up
a short resistance. The Ageyl dismounted, to strip off their cloaks,
head-cloths and shirts; and went on in brown half-nakedness, which they
said would ensure clean wounds if they were hit: also their precious
clothes would not be damaged. Ibn Dakhil in command obtained a quiet
regularity of obedience. They advanced by alternate companies, in open
order, at intervals of four or five yards, with even-numbered companies
in support, making good use of the poor cover which existed.</p>
<p>It was pretty to look at the neat, brown men in the sunlit sandy
valley, with the turquoise pool of salt water in the midst to set off
the crimson banners which two standard bearers carried in the van. They
went along in a steady lope, covering the ground at nearly six miles an
hour, dead silent, and reached and climbed the ridge without a shot
fired. So we knew the work had been finished for us and trotted forward
to find the boy Saleh, son of ibn Shefia, in possession of the town. He
told us that his casualties had been nearly twenty killed; and later we
heard that a British lieutenant of the Air Service had been mortally
wounded in a seaplane reconnaissance, and one British seaman hurt in the
foot.</p>
<p>Vickery, who had directed the battle, was satisfied, but I could not
share his satisfaction. To me an unnecessary action, or shot, or
casualty, was not only waste but sin. I was unable to take the
professional view that all successful actions were gains. Our rebels
were not materials, like soldiers, but friends of ours, trusting our
leadership. We were not in command nationally, but by invitation; and
our men were volunteers, individuals, local men, relatives, so that a
death was a personal sorrow to many in the army. Even from the purely
military point of view the assault seemed to me a blunder.</p>
<p>The two hundred Turks in Wejh had no transport and no food, and if
left alone a few days must have surrendered. Had they escaped, it would
not have mattered the value of an Arab life. We wanted Wejh as a base
against the railway and to extend our front; the smashing and killing in
it had been wanton.</p>
<p>The place was inconveniently smashed. Its townspeople had been warned
by Feisal of the coming attack, and advised either to forestall it by
revolt or to clear out; but they were mostly Egyptians from Kosseir, who
preferred the Turks to us, and decided to wait the issue; so the Shefia
men and the Biasha found the houses packed with fair booty and made a
sweep of it. They robbed the shops, broke open doors, searched every
room, smashed chests and cupboards, tore down all fixed fittings, and
slit each mattress and pillow for hidden treasure; while the fire of the
fleet punched large holes in every prominent wall or building.</p>
<p>Our main difficulty was the landing of stores. The Fox had sunk the
local lighters and rowing boats and there was no sort of quay; but the
resourceful Hardinge thrust herself into the harbour (which was wide
enough but much too short) and landed our stuff in her own cutters. We
raised a tired working party of ibn Shefia followers, and with their
clumsy or languid help got enough food into the place for the moment’s
needs. The townspeople had returned hungry, and furious at the state of
what had been their property; and began their revenge by stealing
everything unguarded, even slitting open the rice-bags on the beach and
carrying away quantities in their held-up skirts. Feisal corrected this
by making the pitiless Maulud Town-governor. He brought in his
rough-riders and in one day of wholesale arrest and summary punishment
persuaded everyone to leave things alone. After that Wejh had the
silence of fear.</p>
<p>Even in the few days which elapsed before I left for Cairo the
profits of our spectacular march began to come in. The Arab movement had
now no opponent in Western Arabia, and had passed beyond danger of
collapse. The vexed Rabegh question died: and we had learnt the first
rules of Beduin warfare. When regarded backward from our benefits of new
knowledge the deaths of those regretted twenty men in the Wejh streets
seemed not so terrible. Vickery’s impatience was justified, perhaps, in
cold blood.</p>
<p>BOOK III</p>
<p>A RAILWAY DIVERSION</p>
<p>Chapters XXVIII to XXXVIII</p>
<p>OUR taking Wejh had the wished effect upon the Turks, who abandoned
their advance towards Mecca for a passive defence of Medina and its
Railway. Our experts made plans for attacking them.</p>
<p>The Germans saw the danger of envelopment, and persuaded Enver to
order the instant evacuation of Medina. Sir Archibald Murray begged us
to put in a sustained attack to destroy the retreating enemy.</p>
<p>Feisal was soon ready in his part: and I went off to Abdulla to get
his co-operation. On the way I fell sick and while lying alone with
empty hands was driven to think about the campaign. Thinking convinced
me that our recent practice had been better than our theory.</p>
<p>So on recovery I did little to the Railway, but went back to Wejh
with novel ideas. I tried to make the others admit them, and adopt
deployment as our ruling principle; and to put preaching even before
fighting. They preferred the limited and direct objective of Medina. So
I decided to slip of to Akaba by myself on test of my own theory.</p>
