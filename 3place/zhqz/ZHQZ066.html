<h4 id="chapter-lv">CHAPTER LV</h4>
<p>THROUGH the whirling dust we perceived that Akaba was all a ruin.
Repeated bombardments by French and English warships had degraded the
place to its original rubbish. The poor houses stood about in a litter,
dirty and contemptible, lacking entirely that dignity which the
durability of their time-challenging bones conferred on ancient
remains.</p>
<p>We wandered into the shadowed grove of palms, at the very break of
the splashing waves, and there sat down to watch our men streaming past
as lines of flushed vacant faces without message for us. For months
Akaba had been the horizon of our minds, the goal: we had had no
thought, we had refused thought, of anything beside. Now, in
achievement, we were a little despising the entities which had spent
their extremest effort on an object whose attainment changed nothing
radical either in mind or body.</p>
<p>In the blank light of victory we could scarcely identify ourselves.
We spoke with surprise, sat emptily, fingered upon our white skirts;
doubtful if we could understand or learn who we were. Others’ noise was
a dreamlike unreality, a singing in ears drowned deep in water. Against
the astonishment of this unasked-for continued life we did not know how
to turn our gift to account. Especially for me was it hard, because
though my sight was sharp, I never saw men’s features: always I peered
beyond, imagining for myself a spirit-reality of this or that: and
to-day each man owned his desire so utterly that he was fulfilled in it,
and became meaningless.</p>
<p>Hunger called us out of our trance. We had now seven hundred
prisoners in addition to our own five hundred men and two thousand
expectant allies. We had not any money (or, indeed, a market); and the
last meal had been two days ago. In our riding-camels we possessed meat
enough for six weeks, but it was poor diet, and a dear one, indulgence
in which would bring future immobility upon us.</p>
<p>Green dates loaded the palms overhead. Their taste, raw, was nearly
as nasty as the want they were to allay. Cooking left them still
deplorable; so we and our prisoners sadly faced a dilemma of constant
hunger, or of violent diurnal pains more proper to gluttony than to our
expedient eating. The assiduous food-habit of a lifetime had trained the
English body to the pitch of producing a punctual nervous excitation in
the upper belly at the fixed hour of each meal: and we sometimes gave
the honoured name of hunger to this sign that our gut had cubic space
for more stuff. Arab hunger was the cry of a long-empty labouring body
fainting with weakness. They lived on a fraction of our bulk-food, and
their systems made exhaustive use of what they got. A nomad army did not
dung the earth richly with by-products.</p>
<p>Our forty-two officer prisoners were an intolerable nuisance. They
were disgusted when they found how ill-provided we were: indeed they
refused to believe it was not a fraud to annoy them, and plagued us for
delicacies, as though Cairo lay hidden in our saddle-bags. To escape
them Nasir and I slept. Always we tried to signalize each accomplished
stage by this little extra peace; for in the desert we were only left
alone by men and flies when lying on our backs, with a cloak to shield
our faces, asleep or feigning sleep.</p>
<p>In the evening, our first reaction against success having passed off,
we began to think how we should keep Akaba, having gained it. We settled
that Auda should return to Guweira. He would there be covered by the
descent of Shtar, and the Guweira sands. In fact, as safe as need be.
But we would make him safer yet, in excess of precaution. We would put
an outpost twenty miles to his north, in the impregnable rock-ruins of
Nabathean Petra, and link them to him by a post at Delagha. Auda should
also send men to Batra so that his Howeitat lie in a semi-circle of four
positions round the edge of the Maan highlands, covering every way
towards Akaba.</p>
<p>These four positions existed independently. The enemy had swallowed
Goltz’ impertinent generalities about the interdependence of
strong-posts. We looked to their delivering a spirited drive against
one, and sitting afterwards in it dazed for an uncomfortable month,
unable to advance for the threat of the remaining three, scratching
their heads and wondering why the others did not fall.</p>
<p>Supper taught us the urgent need to send news over the one hundred
and fifty miles to the British at Suez for a relief-ship. I decided to
go across myself with a party of eight, mostly Howeitat, on the best
camels in the force — one even was the famous Jedhah, the seven-year-old
for whom the Nowasera had fought the beni Sakhr. As we rode round the
bay we discussed the manner of our journey. If we went gently, sparing
the animals, they might fail with hunger. If we rode hard they might
break down with exhaustion or sore feet in mid-desert.</p>
<p>Finally we agreed to keep at a walk, however tempting the surface,
for so many hours of the twenty-four as our endurance would allow. On
such time-tests the man, especially if he were a foreigner, usually
collapsed before the beast: in particular, I had ridden fifty miles a
day for the last month, and was near my limit of strength. If I held
out, we should reach Suez in fifty hours of a march; and, to preclude
cooking-halts upon the road, we carried lumps of boiled camel and
broiled dates in a rag behind our saddles.</p>
<p>We rode up the Sinai scarp by the pilgrims’ granite-hewn road with
its gradient of one in three and a half. The climb was severe, because
hasty, and when we reached the crest before sunset both men and camels
were trembling with fatigue. One camel we thence sent back as unfit for
the trip: with the others we pushed out across the plain to some
thorn-scrub, where they cropped for an hour.</p>
<p>Near midnight we reached Themed, the only wells on our route, in a
clean valley-sweep below the deserted guard-house of the Sinai police.
We let the camels breathe, gave them water and drank ourselves. Then
forward again, plodding through a silence of night so intense that
continually we turned round in the saddles at fancied noises away there
by the cloak of stars. But the activity lay in ourselves, in the
crackling of our passage through the undergrowth perfumed like
ghost-flowers about us.</p>
<p>We marched into the very slow dawn. At sun-up we were far out in the
plain through which sheaves of watercourses gathered towards Arish: and
we stopped to give our camels a few minutes’ mockery of pasture. Then
again in the saddle till noon, and past noon, when behind the mirage
rose the lonely ruins of Nekhl. These we left on our right. At sunset we
halted for an hour.</p>
<p>Camels were sluggish, and ourselves utterly wearied; but Motlog, the
one-eyed owner of Jedhah, called us to action. We remounted, and at a
mechanical walk climbed the Mitla Hills. The moon came out and their
tops, contoured in form-lines of limestone strata, shone as though
crystalline with snow.</p>
<p>In the dawn we passed a melon field, sown by some adventurous Arab in
this no-man’s-land between the armies. We halted another of our precious
hours, loosing the disgusted camels to search the sand-valleys for food
while we cracked the unripe melons and cooled our chapped lips on their
pithy flesh. Then again forward, in the heat of the new day; though the
canal valley, constantly refreshed by breezes from the Gulf of Suez, was
never too oppressive.</p>
<p>By midday we were through the dunes, after a happy switchback ride up
and down their waves, and out on the flatter plain. Suez was to be
guessed at, as the frise of indeterminate points mowing and bobbing in
the mirage of the canal-hollow far in front.</p>
<p>We reached great trench-lines, with forts and barbed wire, roads and
railways, falling to decay. We passed them without challenge. Our aim
was the Shatt, a post opposite Suez on the Asiatic bank of the Canal,
and we gained it at last near three in the afternoon, forty-nine hours
out of Akaba. For a tribal raid this would have been fair time, and we
were tired men before ever we started.</p>
<p>Shatt was in unusual disorder, without even a sentry to stop us,
plague having appeared there two or three days before. So the old camps
had been hurriedly cleared, left standing, while the troops bivouacked
out in the clean desert. Of course we knew nothing of this, but hunted
in the empty offices till we found a telephone. I rang up Suez
headquarters and said I wanted to come across.</p>
<p>They regretted that it was not their business. The Inland Water
Transport managed transit across the Canal, after their own methods.
There was a sniff of implication that these methods were not those of
the General Staff. Undaunted, for I was never a partisan of my nominal
branch of the service, I rang up the office of the Water Board, and
explained that I had just arrived in Shatt from the desert with urgent
news for Headquarters. They were sorry, but had no free boats just then.
They would be sure to send first thing in the morning, to carry me to
the Quarantine Department: and rang off.</p>
