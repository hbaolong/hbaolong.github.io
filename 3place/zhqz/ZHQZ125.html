<h4 id="chapter-cxiv">CHAPTER CXIV</h4>
<p>BEFORE dawn, on the Australian aerodrome, stood two Bristols and a
D.H.9. In one was Ross Smith, my old pilot, who had been picked out to
fly the new Handley-Page, the single machine of its class in Egypt, the
apple of Salmond’s eye. His lending it to fly over the enemy line on so
low an errand as baggage carrying, was a measure of the goodwill toward
us.</p>
<p>We reached Umtaiye in an hour, and saw that the army had gone: so I
waved ourselves back to Um el Surab; and there they were, the defensive
group of cars, and Arabs hiding from our suspect noise here, there and
everywhere; the cute camels dispersed singly over the plain, filling
themselves with the wonderful grazing. Young, when he saw our markings,
put a landing-signal and smoke bombs on the turf which his care and Nuri
Said’s had swept clear of stones.</p>
<p>Ross Smith anxiously paced the length and breadth of the prepared
space, and studied its imperfections: but rejoined us, where the drivers
were making breakfast, with a clear face. The ground was O.K. for the
Handley-Page. Young told us of repeated bombings yesterday and the day
before, which had killed some regulars and some of Pisani’s gunners and
tired the life out of everyone, so that they moved in the night to Um el
Surab. The idiot Turks were still bombing Umtaiye though men went to it
only in the neutral noons and nights to draw water.</p>
<p>Also I heard of Winterton’s last blowing up of the railway: an
amusing night, in which he had met an unknown soldier and explained to
him in broken Arabic how well they were getting on. The soldier had
thanked God for His mercies, and disappeared in the dark; whence a
moment later, machine-gun fire opened from left and right! Nevertheless,
Winterton had fired all his charges, and withdrawn in good order without
loss. Nasir came to us, and reported this man hurt, and that killed,
this clan getting ready, those already joined, but others gone home —
all the gossip of the country. The three shining aeroplanes had much
restored the Arabs, who lauded the British, and their own bravery and
endurance, while I told them the scarce-credible epic of Allenby’s
success — Nablus taken, Afuleh taken, Beisan and Semakh and Haifa. My
hearers’ minds drew after me like flames. Tallal took fire, boasting;
while the Rualla shouted for instant march upon Damascus. Even my
bodyguard, still bearing witness of the Zaagi’s severity in their muddy
eyes and constrained faces, cheered up and began to preen a little
before the crowd, with a dawn of happiness. A shiver of self-assertion
and confidence ran across the camp. I determined to bring up Feisal and
Nuri Shaalan for the final effort.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it was breakfast time with a smell of sausage in the air.
We sat round, very ready: but the watcher on the broken tower yelled
‘Aeroplane up’, seeing one coming over from Deraa. Our Australians,
scrambling wildly to their yet-hot machines, started them in a moment.
Ross Smith, with his observer, leaped into one, and climbed like a cat
up the sky. After him went Peters, while the third pilot stood beside
the D.H.9 and looked hard at me.</p>
<p>I seemed not to understand him. Lewis guns, scarfe mountings, sights,
rings which turned, vanes, knobs which rose and fell on swinging
parallel bars; to shoot, one aimed with this side of the ring or with
that, according to the varied speed and direction of oneself and the
enemy. I had been told the theory, could repeat some of it: but it was
in my head, and rules of action were only snares of action till they had
run out of the empty head into the hands, by use. No: I was not going up
to air-fight, no matter what caste I lost with the pilot. He was an
Australian, of a race delighting in additional risks, not an Arab to
whose gallery I must play.</p>
<p>He was too respectful to speak: only he looked reproach at me while
we watched the battle in the air. There were one enemy two-seater and
three scouts. Ross Smith fastened on the big one, and, after five
minutes of sharp machine-gun rattle, the German dived suddenly towards
the railway line. As it flashed behind the low ridge, there broke out a
pennon of smoke, and from its falling place a soft, dark cloud. An ‘Ah!’
came from the Arabs about us. Five minutes later Ross Smith was back,
and jumped gaily out of his machine, swearing that the Arab front was
the place.</p>
<p>Our sausages were still hot; we ate them, and drank tea (our last
English stores, broached for the visitors), but were hardly at the
grapes from Jebel Druse when again the watchman tossed up his cloak and
screamed, ‘A plane!’ This time Peters won the race, Ross Smith second,
with Traill, disconsolate, in reserve: but the shy enemy turned back so
soon that Peters did not catch them till near Arar: there he drove down
his quarry, fighting. Later, when the wave of war rolled thither, we
found the hopeless crash, and two charred German bodies.</p>
<p>Ross Smith wished he might stay for ever on this Arab front with an
enemy every half-hour; and deeply envied Peters his coming days.
However, he must go back for the Handley-Page with petrol, food and
spares. The third plane was for Azrak, to get the observer marooned
there yesterday; and I went in it so far, to see Feisal.</p>
<p>Time became spacious to those who flew: we were in Azrak thirty hours
after leaving it. Ghurkas and Egyptians I turned back to rejoin the
army, for new demolitions in the north. Then, with Feisal and Nuri
Shaalan, I packed into the green Vauxhall, and off we went for Um el
Surab to see the Handley-Page alight.</p>
<p>We ran at speed over the smooth flint or mud-flat, letting the strong
car throb itself fully: but luck was hostile. A dispute was reported us,
and we had to turn aside to a local Serahin camp. However, we made
profit of our loss, by ordering their fighting men to Umtaiye: and we
had them send word of victory across the railway, that the roads through
the Ajlun hills might be closed to the broken Turkish armies, trying to
escape into safety.</p>
<p>Then our car flashed northward again. Twenty miles short of Ul em
Surab we perceived a single Bedawi, running southward all in a flutter,
his grey hair and grey beard flying in the wind, and his shirt (tucked
up in his belly-cord) puffing out behind him. He altered course to pass
near us, and, raising his bony arms, yelled, ‘The biggest aeroplane in
the world’, before he flapped on into the south, to spread his great
news among the tents.</p>
<p>At Um el Surab the Handley stood majestic on the grass, with Bristols
and 9.A like fledglings beneath its spread of wings. Round it admired
the Arabs, saying, ‘Indeed and at last they have sent us THE aeroplane,
of which these things were foals.’ Before night rumour of Feisal’s
resource went over Jebel Druse and the hollow of Hauran, telling people
that the balance was weighted on our side.</p>
<p>Borton himself had come over in the machine, to concert help. We
talked with him while our men drew from her bomb-racks and fuselage a
ton of petrol; oil and spare parts for Bristol Fighters; tea and sugar
and rations for our men; letters, Reuter telegrams and medicines for us.
Then the great machine rose into the early dusk, for Ramleh, with an
agreed programme of night-bombing against Deraa and Mafrak, to complete
that ruin of the railway traffic which our gun-cotton had begun.</p>
<p>We, for our share, would keep up the gun-cotton pressure. Allenby had
assigned us the Turkish Fourth Army, to harass and contain till Chaytor
forced them out of Amman; and afterwards to cut up, on their retreat.
This retreat was only an affair of days, and it was as certain as things
could be in war that we should raise the plains between us and Damascus
next week. So Feisal decided to add to our column Nuri Shaalan’s Rualla
camel men from Azrak. It would increase to us about four thousand
strong, more than three-fourths irregular; but reliably so, for Nuri,
the hard, silent, cynical old man, held the tribe between his fingers
like a tool.</p>
<p>He was that rarity in the desert, a man without sense of argument. He
would or would not, and there was no more to it. When others finished
talking, he would announce his will in a few flat phrases, and wait
calmly for obedience; which came, for he was feared. He was old and
wise, which meant tired and disappointed: so old that it was my abiding
wonder he should link himself to our enthusiasm.</p>
<p>I rested next day in Nasir’s tent, among his peasant visitors;
sorting out the too-abundant news furnished by their quick wit and
goodwill. During my rest-day, Nuri Said, with Pisani and two guns,
Stirling, Winterton, Young, their armoured cars, and a considerable
force, went openly to the railway, cleared it by approved military
means, destroyed a kilometre of rail, and burnt the tentative wooden
structure with which the Turks were mending the bridge blown up by Joyce
and myself before our first attack on Deraa. Nuri Shaalan, in black
broadcloth cloak, personally led his Rualla horsemen, galloping with the
best of them. Under his eye the tribe showed a valour which drew praise
even from Nuri Said.</p>
