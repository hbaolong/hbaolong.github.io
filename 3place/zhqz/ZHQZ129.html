<h4 id="chapter-cxviii">CHAPTER CXVIII</h4>
<p>BARROW, now watered and fed, was due to leave for his meeting with
Chauvel near Damascus, that they might enter the city together. He asked
us to take the right flank, which suited me, for there, along the Hejaz
line, was Nasir, hanging on to the main Turkish retreat, reducing its
numbers by continuous attack day and night. I had still much to do, and
therefore waited in Deraa another night, savouring its quiet after the
troops had gone; for the station stood at the limit of the open country,
and the Indians round it had angered me by their out-of-placeness. The
essence of the desert was the lonely moving individual, the son of the
road, apart from the world as in a grave. These troops, in flocks like
slow sheep, looked not worthy of the privilege of space.</p>
<p>My mind felt in the Indian rank and file something puny and confined;
an air of thinking themselves mean; almost a careful, esteemed
subservience, unlike the abrupt wholesomeness of Beduin. The manner of
the British officers toward their men struck horror into my bodyguard,
who had never seen personal inequality before.</p>
<p>I had felt man’s iniquity here: and so hated Deraa that I lay each
night with my men upon the old aerodrome. By the charred hangars my
guards, fickle-surfaced as the sea, squabbled after their wont; and
there to-night for the last time Abdulla brought me cooked rice in the
silver bowl. After supping, I tried in the blankness to think forward:
but my mind was a blank, my dreams puffed out like candles by the strong
wind of success. In front was our too-tangible goal: but behind lay the
effort of two years, its misery forgotten or glorified. Names rang
through my head, each in imagination a superlative: Rum the magnificent,
brilliant Petra, Azrak the remote, Batra the very clean. Yet the men had
changed. Death had taken the gentle ones; and the new stridency, of
those who were left, hurt me.</p>
<p>Sleep would not come, so before the light, I woke Stirling and my
drivers, and we four climbed into the Blue Mist, our Rolls tender, and
set out for Damascus, along the dirt road which was first rutted, and
then blocked by the transport columns and rearguard of Barrow’s
division. We cut across country to the French railway, whose old ballast
gave us a clear, if rugged, road; then we put on speed. At noon we saw
Barrow’s pennon at a stream, where he was watering his horses. My
bodyguard were near by, so I took my camel and rode over to him. Like
other confirmed horsemen, he had been a little contemptuous of the
camel; and had suggested, in Deraa, that we might hardly keep up with
his cavalry, which was going to Damascus in about three forced
marches.</p>
<p>So when he saw me freshly riding up he was astonished, and asked when
we left Deraa. ‘This morning.’ His face fell. ‘Where will you stop
to-night?’ ‘In Damascus,’ said I gaily; and rode on, having made another
enemy. It a little smote me to play tricks, for he was generous towards
my wishes: but the stakes were high, beyond his sight, and I cared
nothing what he thought of me so that we won.</p>
<p>I returned to Stirling, and drove on. At each village we left notes
for the British advance guards, telling them where we were, and how far
beyond us the enemy. It irked Stirling and myself to see the caution of
Barrow’s advance; scouts scouting empty valleys, sections crowning every
deserted hill, a screen drawn forward so carefully over friendly
country. It marked the difference between our certain movements and the
tentative processes of normal war.</p>
<p>There could be no crisis till Kiswe, where we were to meet Chauvel,
and where the Hejaz line approached our road. Upon the railway were
Nasir, Nuri Shaalan and Auda, with the tribes; still harrying that
column of four thousand (but in truth nearer seven) marked by our
aeroplane near Sheikh Saad three busy days ago. They had fought
ceaselessly throughout this time of our ease.</p>
<p>As we drove up we heard firing, and saw shrapnel behind a ridge to
our right, where the railway was. Soon appeared the head of a Turkish
column of about two thousand men, in ragged groups, halting now and then
to fire their mountain guns. We ran on to overtake their pursuers, our
great Rolls very blue on the open road. Some Arab horsemen from behind
the Turks galloped towards us, bucketing unhandily across the irrigation
ditches. We recognized Nasir on his liver-coloured stallion, the
splendid animal yet spirited after its hundred miles of a running fight:
also old Nuri Shaalan and about thirty of their servants. They told us
these few were all that remained of the seven thousand Turks. The Rualla
were hanging desperately on to both flanks, while Auda abu Tayi had
ridden behind Jebel Mania to gather the Wuld Ali, his friends, and lie
in wait there for this column, which they hoped to drive over the hill
into his ambush. Did our appearance mean help at last?</p>
<p>I told them the British, in force, were just behind. If they could
delay the enemy only an hour… Nasir looked ahead and saw a walled and
wooded farmstead barring the level. He called to Nuri Shaalan, and they
hastened thither to check the Turks.</p>
<p>We drove back three miles to the leading Indians, and told their
ancient, surly Colonel what a gift the Arabs brought. He seemed not
pleased to upset the beautiful order of his march, but at last opened
out a squadron and sent them slowly across the plain towards the Turks,
who turned the little guns their way. One or two shells burst nearly
among the files, and then to our horror (for Nasir had put himself in
jeopardy, expecting courageous help) the Colonel ordered a retirement,
and fell back quickly to the road. Stirling and myself, hopping mad,
dashed down and begged him not to be afraid of mountain guns, no heavier
than Very pistols: but neither to kindness nor to wrath did the old man
budge an inch. We raced a third time back along the road in search of
higher authority.</p>
<p>A red-tipped Aide told us that over there was General Gregory. We
blessed him, Stirling’s professional pride nearly in tears at the
mismanagement. We pulled our friend aboard and found his General, to
whom we lent our car that the brigade major might take hot orders to the
cavalry. A galloper hurtled back for the horse artillery, which opened
first just as the last of the light fled up the hill to its summit and
took refuge in the clouds. Middlesex Yeomanry appeared and were pushed
in among the Arabs, to charge the Turkish rear; and, as the night fell,
we saw the break-up of the enemy, who abandoned their guns, their
transport and all their stuff and went streaming up the col towards the
two peaks of Mania, escaping into what they thought was empty land
beyond.</p>
<p>However, in the empty land was Auda; and in that night of his last
battle the old man killed and killed, plundered and captured, till dawn
showed him the end. There passed the Fourth Army, our stumbling-block
for two years.</p>
<p>Gregory’s happy vigour heartened us to face Nasir. We drove to Kiswe,
where we had agreed to meet him before midnight. After us came the press
of Indian troops. We sought a retired spot; but already there were men
by the thousand everywhere.</p>
<p>The movement and cross-currents of so many crowded minds drove me
about, restlessly, like themselves. In the night my colour was unseen. I
could walk as I pleased, an unconsidered Arab: and this finding myself
among, but cut off from, my own kin made me strangely alone. Our
armoured-car men were persons to me, from their fewness and our long
companionship; and also in their selves, for these months unshieldedly
open to the flaming sun and bullying wind had worn and refined them into
individuals. In such a mob of unaccustomed soldiery, British, Australian
and Indian, they went as strange and timid as myself; distinguished also
by grime, for with weeks of wearing their clothes had been moulded to
them by sweat and use and had become rather integuments than
wrappings.</p>
<p>But these others were really soldiers, a novelty after two years’
irregularity. And it came upon me freshly how the secret of uniform was
to make a crowd solid, dignified, impersonal: to give it the singleness
and tautness of an upstanding man. This death’s livery which walled its
bearers from ordinary life, was sign that they had sold their wills and
bodies to the State: and contracted themselves into a service not the
less abject for that its beginning was voluntary. Some of them had
obeyed the instinct of lawlessness: some were hungry: others thirsted
for glamour, for the supposed colour of a military life: but, of them
all, those only received satisfaction who had sought to degrade
themselves, for to the peace-eye they were below humanity. Only women
with a lech were allured by those witnessing clothes; the soldiers’ pay,
not sustenance like a labourer’s, but pocket-money, seemed most
profitably spent when it let them drink sometimes and forget.</p>
<p>Convicts had violence put upon them. Slaves might be free, if they
could, in intention. But the soldier assigned his owner the twenty-four
hours’ use of his body; and sole conduct of his mind and passions. A
convict had licence to hate the rule which confined him, and all
humanity outside, if he were greedy in hate: but the sulking soldier was
a bad soldier; indeed, no soldier. His affections must be hired pieces
on the chess-board of the king.</p>
<p>The strange power of war which made us all as a duty so demean
ourselves! These Australians, shouldering me in unceremonious horseplay,
had put off half civilization with their civil clothes. They were
dominant to-night, too sure of themselves to be careful: and yet: — as
they lazily swaggered those quick bodies, all curves with never a
straight line, but with old and disillusioned eyes: and yet: — I felt
them thin-tempered, hollow, instinctive; always going to do great
things; with the disquieting suppleness of blades half-drawn from the
scabbard. Disquieting: not dreadful.</p>
<p>The English fellows were not instinctive, nor negligent like the
Australians, but held themselves, with a slow-eyed, almost sheepish
care. They were prim in dress, and quiet; going shyly in pairs. The
Australians stood in groups and walked singly: the British clung two and
two, in a celibate friendliness which expressed the level of the ranks:
the commonness of their Army clothes. ‘Holding together’ they called it:
a war-time yearning to keep within four ears such thoughts as were deep
enough to hurt.</p>
<p>About the soldiers hung the Arabs: gravely-gazing men from another
sphere. My crooked duty had banished me among them for two years.
To-night I was nearer to them than to the troops, and I resented it, as
shameful. The intruding contrast mixed with longing for home, to sharpen
my faculties and make fertile my distaste, till not merely did I see the
unlikeness of race, and hear the unlikeness of language, but I learned
to pick between their smells: the heavy, standing, curdled sourness of
dried sweat in cotton, over the Arab crowds; and the feral smell of
English soldiers: that hot pissy aura of thronged men in woollen
clothes: a tart pungency, breath-catching, ammoniacal; a fervent
fermenting naphtha-smell.</p>
