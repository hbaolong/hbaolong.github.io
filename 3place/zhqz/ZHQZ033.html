<h4 id="chapter-xxii">CHAPTER XXII</h4>
<p>FEISAL was a fine, hot workman, whole-heartedly doing a thing when he
had agreed to it. He had pledged his word that he would go at once to
Wejh; so he and I sat down together on new-year’s day for consideration
of what this move meant to us and to the Turks. Around us, stretching up
and down the Wadi Yenbo for miles, in little groups round palm-gardens,
under the thicker trees, and in all the side tributaries, wherever there
was shelter from the sun and rain, or good grazing for the camels, were
the soldiers of our army. The mountaineers, half-naked footmen, had
grown few. Most of the six thousand present were mounted men of
substance. Their coffee hearths were outlined from afar by the camel
saddles, pitched in circles round the fire as elbow-rests for men
reclining between meals. The Arabs’ physical perfection let them lie
relaxed to the stony ground like lizards, moulding themselves to its
roughness in corpse-like abandon.</p>
<p>They were quiet but confident. Some, who had been serving Feisal for
six months or more, had lost that pristine heat of eagerness which had
so thrilled me in Hamra; but they had gained experience in compensation;
and staying-power in the ideal was fatter and more important for us than
an early fierceness. Their patriotism was now conscious; and their
attendance grew more regular as the distance from their homes increased.
Tribal independence of orders was still maintained; but they had
achieved a mild routine in camp life and on the march. When the Sherif
came near they fell into a ragged line, and together made the bow and
sweep of the arm to the lips, which was the official salute. They did
not oil their guns: they said lest the sand clog them; also they had no
oil, and it was better rubbed in to soften wind-chaps on their skin; but
the guns were decently kept, and some of the owners could shoot at long
range.</p>
<p>In mass they were not formidable, since they had no corporate spirit,
nor discipline nor mutual confidence. The smaller the unit the better
its performance. A thousand were a mob, ineffective against a company of
trained Turks: but three or four Arabs in their hills would stop a dozen
Turks. Napoleon remarked this of the Mamelukes. We were yet too
breathless to turn our hasty practice into principle: our tactics were
empirical snatchings of the first means to escape difficulty. But we
were learning like our men.</p>
<p>From the battle of Nakhl Mubarak we abandoned the brigading of
Egyptian troops with irregulars. We embarked the Egyptian officers and
men, after turning over their complete equipment to Rasim, Feisal’s
gunner, and Abdulla el Deleimi, his machine-gun officer. They built up
Arab companies out of local material, with a stiffening of Turk-trained
Syrian and Mesopotamian deserters. Maulud, the fire-eating A.D.C.,
begged fifty mules off me, put across them fifty of his trained
infantrymen, and told them they were cavalry. He was a martinet, and a
born mounted officer, and by his spartan exercises the much-beaten
mule-riders grew painfully into excellent soldiers, instantly obedient
and capable of formal attack! They were prodigies in the Arab ranks. We
telegraphed for another fifty mules, to double the dose of mounted
infantry, since the value of so tough a unit for reconnaissance was
obvious.</p>
<p>Feisal suggested taking nearly all the Juheina to Wejh with him and
adding to them enough of the Harb and Billi, Ateiba and Ageyl to give
the mass a many-tribed character. We wanted this march, which would be
in its way a closing act of the war in Northern Hejaz, to send a rumour
through the length and breadth of Western Arabia. It was to be the
biggest operation of the Arabs in their memory; dismissing those who saw
it to their homes, with a sense that their world had changed indeed; so
that there would be no more silly defections and jealousies of clans
behind us in future, to cripple us with family politics in the middle of
our fighting.</p>
<p>Not that we expected immediate opposition. We bothered to take this
unwieldy mob with us to Wejh, in the teeth of efficiency and experience,
just because there was no fighting in the bill. We had intangible assets
on our side. In the first place, the Turks had now engaged their surplus
strength in attacking Rabegh, or rather in prolonging their occupied
area so as to attack Rabegh. It would take them days to transfer back
north. Then the Turks were stupid, and we reckoned on their not hearing
all at once of our move, and on their not believing its first tale, and
not seeing till later what chances it had given them. If we did our
march in three weeks we should probably take Wejh by surprise. Lastly,
we might develop the sporadic raiding activity of the Harb into
conscious operations, to take booty, if possible, in order to be
self-supporting; but primarily to lock up large numbers of Turks in
defence positions. Zeid agreed to go down to Rabegh to organize similar
pin-pricks in the Turks’ rear. I gave him letters to the captain of the
Dufferin, the Yenbo guardship, which would ensure him a quick passage
down: for all who knew of the Wejh scheme were agog to help it.</p>
<p>To exercise my own hand in the raiding genre I took a test party of
thirty-five Mahamid with me from Nakhl Mubarak, on the second day of
1917, to the old blockhouse-well of my first journey from Rabegh to
Yenbo. When dark came we dismounted, and left our camels with ten men to
guard them against possible Turkish patrols. The rest of us climbed up
Dhifran: a painful climb, for the hills were of knife-sharp strata
turned on edge and running in oblique lines from crest to foot. They
gave abundance of broken surface, but no sure grip, for the stone was so
minutely cracked that any segment would come away from its matrix, in
the hand.</p>
<p>The head of Dhifran was cold and misty, and time dragged till dawn.
We disposed ourselves in crevices of the rock, and at last saw the tips
of bell-tents three hundred yards away beneath us to the right, behind a
spur. We could not get a full view, so contented ourselves with putting
bullets through their tops. A crowd of Turks turned out and leaped like
stags into their trenches. They were very fast targets, and probably
suffered little. In return they opened rapid fire in every direction,
and made a terrific row; as if signalling the Hamra force to turn out in
their help. As the enemy were already more than ten to one, the
reinforcements might have prevented our retreat: so we crawled gently
back till we could rush down into the first valley, where we fell over
two scared Turks, unbuttoned, at their morning exercise. They were
ragged, but something to show, and we dragged them homeward, where their
news proved useful.</p>
<p>Feisal was still nervous over abandoning Yenbo, hitherto his
indispensable base, and the second sea-port of Hejaz: and when casting
about for further expedients to distract the Turks from its occupation
we suddenly remembered Sidi Abdulla in Henakiyeh. He had some five
thousand irregulars, and a few guns and machine-guns, and the reputation
of his successful (if too slow) siege of Taif. It seemed a shame to
leave him wasting in the middle of the wilderness. A first idea was that
he might come to Kheibar, to threaten the railway north of Medina: but
Feisal improved my plan vastly, by remembering Wadi Ais, the historic
valley of springs and palm-villages flowing through the impregnable
Juheina hills from behind Rudhwa eastward to the Hamdh valley near
Hedia. It lay just one hundred kilometres north of Medina, a direct
threat on Fakhri’s railway communications with Damascus. From it Abdulla
could keep up his arranged blockade of Medina from the east, against
caravans from the Persian Gulf. Also it was near Yenbo, which could
easily feed him there with munitions and supplies.</p>
<p>The proposal was obviously an inspiration and we sent off Raja el
Khuluwi at once to put it to Abdulla. So sure were we of his adopting it
that we urged Feisal to move away from Wadi Yenbo northward on the first
stage to Wejh, without waiting a reply.</p>
