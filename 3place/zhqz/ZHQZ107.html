<h4 id="chapter-xcvi">CHAPTER XCVI</h4>
<p>NASIR attacked Hesa station in his old fashion, cutting the line to
north and south the night before, and opening a sharp bombardment of the
buildings when it was light enough to see. Rasim was the gunner and the
gun our Krupp antiquity of Medina, Wejh and Tafileh. When the Turks
weakened, the Arabs charged into the station, Beni Sakhr and Howeitat
vying for the lead.</p>
<p>We had, of course, no killed; as was ever the way with such tactics.
Hornby and Peake reduced the place to a heap of ruins. They blew in the
well, the tanks, engines, pumps, buildings, three bridges, rolling
stock, and about four miles of rail. Next day Nasir moved north, and
destroyed Faraifra station. Peake and Hornby continued work that day and
the day following. Altogether it sounded like our biggest demolition. I
determined to go up and see for myself.</p>
<p>A dozen of my men marched with me. Below the Rasheidiya ridge we came
to the lone tree, Shejerat el Tayar. My Hauranis drew rein under its
thorny branches, on which were impaled many tatters of wayfarers’
offered clothes. Mohammed said, ‘Upon you, O Mustafa’. Reluctantly
Mustafa let himself down from his saddle and piece by piece took off his
clothes, till nearly naked, when he lay down arching himself over the
tumbled cairn. The other men dismounted, picked each a thorn, and in
solemn file drove them (hard and sharp as brass) deep into his flesh and
left them standing there. The Ageyl stared openmouthed at the ceremony,
but before it ended swung themselves monkey-like down, grinning lewdly,
and stabbed in their thorns where they would be most painful. Mustafa
shivered quietly till he heard Mohammed say, ‘Get up’, using the
feminine inflexion. He sadly pulled out the thorns, dressed, and
remounted. Abdulla knew no reason for the punishment: and the Hauranis’
manner showed that they did not wish me to ask them. We reached Hesa to
find Nasir, with six hundred men, concealed under cliffs and bushes,
afraid of enemy aircraft, which had killed many. One bomb had fallen
into a pool while eleven camels had been drinking, and had thrown them
all, dead, in a ring about the water-side among torn flowers of
oleander. We wrote to Air-Vice-Marshal Salmond for a revengeful
counterstroke.</p>
<p>The railway was still in Nasir’s hand, and whenever they had
explosives Hornby and Peake went down to it. They had blown in a
cutting, and were developing a new rail-demolition, turning over each
section by main force, as it was cut. From Sultani in the north to Jurf
in the south, the damage extended. Fourteen miles. Nasir fully
understood the importance of maintaining his activity, and there seemed
a fair hope of his lasting. He had found a comfortable and bomb-proof
cave between two limestone reefs, which, articulated like teeth, broke
out from the green hill-side. The heat and flies in the valley were not
yet formidable. It was running with water: fertile with pasture. Behind
lay Tafileh; and if Nasir were hard pressed he had only to send a
message, and the mounted peasantry of the villages, on their rough
ponies jangling with shrill bells, would come pouring over the range to
his support.</p>
<p>The day of our arrival the Turks sent a force of camel corps, cavalry
and infantry, down to re-occupy Faraifra as a first counter-stroke.
Nasir at once was up and at them. While his machine-guns kept down the
Turks’ heads, the Abu Tayi charged up to within a hundred yards of the
crumbling wall which was the only defence, and cut out all the camels
and some horses. To expose riding-animals to the sight of Beduins was a
sure way to lose them.</p>
<p>Afterwards I was down with Auda, near the fork of the valley, when
there came the throbbing and moaning overhead of Mercedes engines.
Nature stilled itself before the master noise; even the birds and
insects hushed. We crawled between fallen boulders, and heard the first
bomb drop lower in the valley where Peake’s camp lay hidden in a
twelve-foot oleander thicket. The machines were flying towards us, for
the next bombs were nearer; and the last fell just in front, with a
shattering, dusty roar, by our captured camels.</p>
<p>When the smoke cleared, two of them were kicking in agony on the
ground. A faceless man, spraying blood from a fringe of red flesh about
his neck, stumbled screaming towards our rocks. He crashed blindly over
one and another, tripping and scrambling with arms outstretched,
maddened by pain. In a moment he lay quiet, and we who had scattered
from him ventured near: but he was dead.</p>
<p>I went back to Nasir, safe in his cave with Nawaf el Faiz, brother of
Mithgal, head of the Beni Sakhr. Nawaf, a shifty man, was so full and
careful of his pride that he would stoop to any private meanness to
preserve it publicly: but then he was mad, like all the Faiz clan;
uncertain like them; and voluble, with flickering eyes.</p>
<p>Our acquaintance of before the war had been renewed secretly a year
before, when three of us crept in after sunset to their rich family
tents near Ziza. Fawaz, the senior Faiz, was a notable Arab, a
committeeman of the Damascus group, prominent in the party of
independence. He received me with fair words and hospitality, fed us
richly, and brought out, after we had talked, his richest
bed-quilts.</p>
<p>I had slept an hour or two when a charged voice whispered through a
smoke-smelling beard into my ear. It was Nawaf, the brother, to say
that, behind the friendly seeming, Fawaz had sent horsemen to Ziza and
soon the troops would be here to take me. We were certainly caught. My
Arabs crouched in their place, meaning to fight like cornered animals,
and kill at least some of the enemy before they themselves died. Such
tactics displeased me. When combats came to the physical, bare hand
against hand, I was finished. The disgust of being touched revolted me
more than the thought of death and defeat: perhaps because one such
terrible struggle in my youth had given me an enduring fear of contact:
or because I so reverenced my wits and depised my body that I would not
be beholden to the second for the life of the first.</p>
<p>I whispered to Nawaf for counsel. He crawled back through the
tent-curtain; we followed dragging my few things in their light
saddle-pouch. Behind the next tent, his own, sat the camels,
knee-haltered and saddled. We mounted circumspectly. Nawaf led out his
mare, and guided us, loaded rifle across his thigh, to the railway and
beyond it into the desert. There he gave us the star-direction of our
supposed goal in Bair. A few days later Sheikh Fawaz was dead.</p>
