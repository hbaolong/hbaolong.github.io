<h4 id="published-texts">PUBLISHED TEXTS</h4>
<p>New York Text</p>
<p>A PROOF of the subscribers’ text was sent to New York, and reprinted
there by the George Doran Publishing Company. This was necessary to
ensure U.S.A. copyright of the Seven Pillars. Ten copies are offered for
sale, at a price high enough to prevent their ever being sold.</p>
<p>No further issue of the Seven Pillars will be made in my
lifetime.</p>
<p>Revolt in the Desert</p>
<p>This abridgement of the Seven Pillars contains about 130,000 words.
It was made by myself in 1926, with the minimum of necessary adjustment
(perhaps three new paragraphs in all) to preserve sense and continuity.
Parts of it appeared serially in the Daily Telegraph in December 1926.
The whole was published in England by Jonathan Cape, and in U.S.A. by
Doran in March 1927.</p>
<p>T. E. SHAW</p>
<p>To bring the information up to date, I add that the remaining copies
of the Oxford printed Text of 1922 are still in existence, but will not
be made public for at least ten years, and then only in a limited
edition. Revolt in the Desert will not be printed again, at least during
the remainder of the legal term of copyright.</p>
<p>The text of the present edition (1935) is identical with that of the
thirty-guinea edition of 1926, except for the following omissions and
alterations. The omissions are necessary to save hurting the feelings of
persons still living; they come on pages 61, 62, and 329 where gaps of
the same length are left in the present text. The 1926 edition contains
no Chapter XI; the chapters have now been renumbered to remove this
anomaly. On p. 300 (line 7) the phrase ‘halts to breath’ has been
changed to ‘halts to breathe’ in agreement with the corresponding
passage in the Oxford Text of 1922, ‘we let the camels breathe a
little’. On p. 398 (line 14) the word ‘Humber’ has been printed in
italics instead of Roman type, to make the sense clearer; in 1926 the
names of some other ships were similarly italicized.</p>
<p>The spelling of Arabic names varies greatly in all editions, and I
have made no alterations. It should be explained that only three vowels
are recognized in Arabic, and that some of the consonants have no
equivalents in English. The general practice of orientalists in recent
years has been to adopt one of the various sets of conventional signs
for the letters and vowel marks of the Arabic alphabet, transliterating
Mohamed as Muhammad, muezzin as mu’edhdhin, and Koran as Qur’an or
Kur’an. This method is useful to those who know what it means, but this
book follows the old fashion of writing the best phonetic approximations
according to ordinary English spelling. The same place-name will be
found spelt in several different ways, not only because the sound of
many Arabic words can legitimately be represented in English in a
variety of ways, but also because the natives of a district often differ
as to the pronunciation of any place-name which has not already become
famous or fixed by literary usage. (For example a locality near Akaba is
called Abu Lissan, Aba el Lissan or Abu Lissal.) A reference by the
author to his views on this matter occurs on page 664. I reprint here a
series of questions by the publisher and answers by the author
concerning the printing of Revolt in the Desert.</p>
<ol start="17" type="A">
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>I attach a list of queries raised by F. who is reading the proofs. He
finds these very clean, but full of inconsistencies in the spelling of
proper names, a point which reviewers often take up. Will you annotate
it in the margin, so that I can get the proofs straightened?</p>
<p>Annotated: not very helpfully perhaps. Arabic names won’t go into
English, exactly, for their consonants are not the same as ours, and
their vowels, like ours, vary from district to district. There are some
‘scientific systems’ of transliteration, helpful to people who know
enough Arabic not to need helping, but a washout for the world. I spell
my names anyhow, to show what rot the systems are.</p>
<p>Slip 1. Jeddah and Jidda used impartially throughout.
Intentional?</p>
<p>Rather!</p>
<p>Slip 16. Bir Waheida, was Bir Waheidi.</p>
<p>Why not? All one place.</p>
<p>Slip 20. Nuri, Emir of the Ruwalla, belongs to the ‘chief family of
the Rualla’. On Slip 23 ‘Rualla horse’, and Slip 38, ‘killed one Rueli’.
In all later slips ‘Rualla’.</p>
<p>Should have also used Ruwala and Ruala.</p>
<p>Slip 28. The Bisaita is also spelt Biseita.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Slip 47. Jedha, the she-camel, was Jedhah on Slip 40.</p>
<p>She was a splendid beast.</p>
<p>Slip 53. ‘Meleager, the immoral poet’. I have put ‘immortal’ poet,
but the author may mean immoral after all.</p>
<p>Immorality I know. Immortality I cannot judge. As you please:
Meleager will not sue us for libel.</p>
<p>Slip 65. Author is addressed ‘Ya Auruns’, but on Slip 56 was
‘Aurans’.</p>
<p>Also Lurens and Runs: not to mention ‘Shaw’. More to follow, if time
permits.</p>
<p>Slip 78. Sherif Abd el Mayin of Slip 68 becomes el Main, el Mayein,
el Muein, el Mayin, and el Muyein.</p>
<p>Good egg. I call this really ingenious.</p>
