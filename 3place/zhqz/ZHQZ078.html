<h4 id="chapter-lxvii">CHAPTER LXVII</h4>
<p>LEWIS and Stokes had come down to help me. I was a little anxious
about them; for the Arabs, having lost their wits, were as ready to
assault friend as foe. Three times I had had to defend myself when they
pretended not to know me and snatched at my things. However, the
sergeants’ war-stained khaki presented few attractions. Lewis went out
east of the railway to count the thirty men he had slain; and
incidentally, to find Turkish gold and trophies in their haversacks.
Stokes strolled through the wrecked bridge, saw there the bodies of
twenty Turks torn to pieces by his second shell, and retired
hurriedly.</p>
<p>Ahmed came up to me with his arms full of booty and shouted (no Arab
could speak normally in the thrill of victory) that an old woman in the
last waggon but one wished to see me. I sent him at once, empty-handed,
for my camel and some baggage camels to remove the guns; for the enemy’s
fire was now plainly audible, and the Arabs, sated with spoils, were
escaping one by one towards the hills, driving tottering camels before
them into safety. It was bad tactics to leave the guns until the end:
but the confusion of a first, overwhelmingly successful, experiment had
dulled our judgement.</p>
<p>In the end of the waggon sat an ancient and very tremulous Arab dame,
who asked me what it was all about. I explained. She said that though an
old friend and hostess of Feisal, she was too infirm to travel and must
wait her death there. I replied that she would not be harmed. The Turks
were almost arrived and would recover what remained of the train. She
accepted this, and begged me to find her old negress, to bring her
water. The slave woman filled a cup from the spouting tender of the
first engine (delicious water, from which Lewis was slaking his thirst),
and then I led her to her grateful mistress. Months after there came to
me secretly from Damascus a letter and a pleasant little Baluchi carpet
from the lady Ayesha, daughter of Jellal el Lel, of Medina, in memory of
an odd meeting.</p>
<p>Ahmed never brought the camels. My men, possessed by greed, had
dispersed over the land with the Beduins. The sergeants and I were alone
by the wreck, which had a strange silence now. We began to fear that we
must abandon the guns and run for it, but just then saw two camels
dashing back. Zaal and Howeimil had missed me and had returned in
search.</p>
<p>We were rolling up the insulated cable, our only piece. Zaal dropped
from his camel and would have me mount and ride; but, instead, we loaded
it with the wire and the exploder. Zaal found time to laugh at our
quaint booty, after all the gold and silver in the train. Howeimil was
dead lame from an old wound in the knee and could not walk, but we made
him couch his camel, and hoisted the Lewis guns, tied butt to butt like
scissors, behind his saddle. There remained the trench mortars; but
Stokes reappeared, unskilfully leading by the nose a baggage camel he
had found straying. We packed the mortars in haste; put Stokes (who was
still weak with his dysentery) on Zaal’s saddle, with the Lewis guns,
and sent off the three camels in charge of Howeimil, at their best
pace.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lewis and Zaal, in a sheltered and invisible hollow behind
the old-gun position, made a fire of cartridge boxes, petrol and waste,
banked round it the Lewis drums and the spare small-arms ammunition;
and, gingerly, on the top, laid some loose Stokes’ shells. Then we ran.
As the flames reached the cordite and ammonal there was a colossal and
continuing noise. The thousands of cartridges exploded in series like
massed machine-guns, and the shells roared off in thick columns of dust
and smoke. The outflanking Turks, impressed by the tremendous defence,
felt that we were in strength and strongly posted. They halted their
rush, took cover, and began carefully to surround our position and
reconnoitre it according to rule, while we sped panting into concealment
among the ridges.</p>
<p>It seemed a happy ending to the affair, and we were glad to get off
with no more loss than my camels and baggage; though this included the
sergeants’ cherished kits. However, there was food at Rumm, and Zaal
thought perhaps we should find our property with the others, who were
waiting ahead. We did. My men were loaded with booty, and had with them
all our camels whose saddles were being suddenly delivered of spoils to
look ready for our mounting.</p>
<p>Softly I explained what I thought of the two men who had been ordered
to bring up the camels when the firing ceased. They pleaded that the
explosion had scattered everyone in fright, and afterwards the Arabs had
appropriated each man any animal he saw. This was probably true; but my
men also were able-bodied and might have helped themselves. We asked if
anyone were hurt, and a voice said that the Shimt’s boy — a very dashing
fellow — had been killed in the first rush forward at the train. This
rush was a mistake, made without instructions, as the Lewis and Stokes
guns were sure to end the business if the mine worked properly. So I
felt that his loss was not directly my reproach.</p>
<p>Three men had been slightly wounded. Then one of Feisal’s slaves
vouchsafed that Salem was missing. We called everyone together and
questioned them. At last an Arab said that he had seen him lying hit,
just beyond the engine. This reminded Lewis, who, ignorant that he was
one of us, had seen a negro on the ground there, badly hurt. I had not
been told and was angry, for half the Howeitat must have known of it,
and that Salem was in my charge. By their default now, for the second
time, I had left a friend behind.</p>
<p>I asked for volunteers to come back and find him. After a little Zaal
agreed, and then twelve of the Nowasera. We trotted fast across the
plain towards the line. As we topped the last ridge but one we saw the
train-wreck with Turks swarming over it. There must have been one
hundred and fifty of them, and our attempt was hopeless. Salem would
have been dead, for the Turks did not take Arab prisoners. Indeed, they
used to kill them horribly; so, in mercy, we were finishing those of our
badly wounded who would have to be left helpless on abandoned
ground.</p>
<p>We must give up Salem; but, to make some profit out of our return, I
suggested to Zaal that we slip up-valley and recover the sergeants’
kits. He was willing, and we rode till the Turks’ shooting drove us to
cover behind a bank. Our camp had been in the next hollow, across a
hundred yards of flat. So, watching the time, one or two of the quicker
youths nipped across to drag back the saddle-bags. The Turks were
distant, and Turkish long-range fire was always bad; but for our third
trip they got up a machine-gun, and the dusty splashes of the bullets on
the dark flints let them group well about us.</p>
<p>I sent the running boys away, picked out what was light and best of
the remaining baggage, and rejoined the party. We pounded down the slope
and across. In the open the Turks could clearly count our fewness. They
grew bold and ran forward on both flanks to cut us off. Zaal threw
himself from his camel, climbed with five men to the peak of the ridge
we had just crossed, and fired back at them. He was a marvellous shot,
whom I had seen to bring down a running gazelle from the saddle with his
second bullet at three hundred yards, and his fire checked them.</p>
<p>He called to us laden men to hurry across the next hollow and hold it
while he fell back on us, and in this fashion we retired from ridge to
ridge, putting up a good delay action and hitting thirteen or fourteen
Turks at a cost of four camels wounded. At last, when we were only two
ridges from our supports, and were feeling sure that we should do it
easily, a solitary rider appeared, coming up. It was Lewis, with a Lewis
gun held efficiently across his thighs. He had heard the rapid fire, and
thought to see if we needed nelp.</p>
<p>He changed our strength very much, and my mind, for I was angry with
the Turks, who had got Salem and had chased us breathless so far in dust
and heat and streaming sweat. Therefore we took place to give our
pursuers a knock; but either they suspected our silence, or they feared
the distance they had come; anyway, we saw no more of them. After a few
minutes we became cool, and wise-headed enough to ride off after the
others.</p>
<p>They had marched very heavy-laden. Of our ninety prisoners, ten were
friendly Medina women electing to go to Mecca by way of Feisal. There
had been twenty-two riderless camels. The women had climbed on to five
pack-saddles, and the wounded were in pairs on the residue. It was late
in the afternoon. We were exhausted, the prisoners had drunk all our
water. We must re-fill from the old well at Mudowwara that night to
sustain ourselves so far as Rumm.</p>
<p>As the well was close to the station, it was highly desirable that we
get to it and away, lest the Turks divine our course and find us there
defenceless. We broke up into little parties and struggled north.
Victory always undid an Arab force, so we were no longer a raiding
party, but a stumbling baggage caravan, loaded to breaking point with
enough household goods to make rich an Arab tribe for years.</p>
<p>My sergeants asked me for a sword each, as souvenir of their first
private battle. As I went down the column to look out something,
suddenly I met Feisal’s freedmen; and to my astonishment on the crupper
behind one of them, strapped to him, soaked with blood, unconscious, was
the missing Salem.</p>
<p>I trotted up to Ferhan and asked wherever he had found him. He told
me that when the Stokes gun fired its first shell, Salem rushed past the
locomotive, and one of the Turks shot him in the back. The bullet had
come out near his spine, without, in their judgment, hurting him
mortally. After the train was taken, the Howeitat had stripped him of
cloak, dagger, rifle and head-gear. Mijbil, one of the freedmen, had
found him, lifted him straight to his camel, and trekked off homeward
without telling us. Ferhan, overtaking him on the road, had relieved him
of Salem; who, when he recovered, as later he did, perfectly, bore me
always a little grudge for having left him behind, when he was of my
company and wounded. I had failed in staunchness. My habit of hiding
behind a Sherif was to avoid measuring myself against the pitiless Arab
standard, with its no-mercy for foreigners who wore its clothes, and
aped its manners. Not often was I caught with so poor a shield as blind
Sherif Aid.</p>
<p>We reached the well in three hours and watered without mishap.
Afterwards we moved off another ten miles or so, beyond fear of pursuit.
There we lay down and slept, and in the morning found ourselves happily
tired. Stokes had had his dysentery heavy upon him the night before, but
sleep and the ending of anxiety made him well. He and I and Lewis, the
only unburdened ones, went on in front across one huge mud-flat after
another till just before sunset we were at the bottom of Wadi Rumm.</p>
<p>This new route was important for our armoured cars, because its
twenty miles of hard mud might enable them to reach Mudowwara easily. If
so, we should be able to hold up the circulation of trains when we
pleased. Thinking of this, we wheeled into the avenue of Rumm, still
gorgeous in sunset colour; the cliffs as red as the clouds in the west,
like them in scale and in the level bar they raised against the sky.
Again we felt how Rumm inhibited excitement by its serene beauty. Such
whelming greatness dwarfed us, stripped off the cloak of laughter in
which we had ridden over the jocund flats.</p>
<p>Night came down, and the valley became a mind-landscape. The
invisible cliffs boded as presences; imagination tried to piece out the
plan of their battlements by tracing the dark pattern they cut in the
canopy of stars. The blackness in the depth was very real — it was a
night to despair of movement. We felt only our camels’ labour, as hour
after hour monotonously and smoothly they shouldered their puny way
along the unfenced level, with the wall in front no nearer and the wall
behind no further than at first.</p>
<p>About nine at night we were before the pit in which lay the water and
our old camp. We knew its place because the deep darkness there grew
humidly darker. We turned our camels to the right and advanced towards
the rock, which reared its crested domes so high over us that the ropes
of our head-cloths slipped back round our necks as we stared up. Surely
if we stretched out even our camel-sticks in front of us we should touch
the facing walls; yet for many paces more we crept in under their
horns.</p>
<p>At last we were in the tall bushes: then we shouted. An Arab shouted
back. The echoes of my voice rolling down from the cliff met his rising
cry, and the sounds wrapped themselves together and wrestled among the
crags. A flame flickered palely on the left, and we found Musa our
watchman there. He lit a fire of powerfully scented wood, and by its
light we broke open bully-beef and fed ravenously; gulping down, through
our food, bowl after bowl of the delicious water, ice-cold, and heady
after the foul drink of Mudowwara; which, for days, had seared our
throats.</p>
<p>We slept through the coming of the rest. Two days later we were at
Akaba; entering in glory, laden with precious things, and boasting that
the trains were at our mercy. From Akaba the two sergeants took hurried
ship to Egypt. Cairo had remembered them and gone peevish because of
their non-return. However, they could pay the penalty of this
cheerfully. They had won a battle single-handed; had had dysentery;
lived on camel-milk; and learned to ride a camel fifty miles a day
without pain. Also Allenby gave them a medal each.</p>
