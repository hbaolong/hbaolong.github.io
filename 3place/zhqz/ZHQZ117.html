<h4 id="chapter-cvi">CHAPTER CVI</h4>
<p>JOYCE’S ship had come up from Jidda, with theMeccan mail. Feisal
opened his Kibla (King Hussein’s Gazette) to find staring at him a Royal
Proclamation, saying that fools were calling Jaafar Pasha the General
Officer Commanding the Arab Northern Army, whereas there was no such
rank, indeed no rank higher than captain in the Arab Army, wherein
Sheikh Jaafar, like another, was doing his duty!</p>
<p>This had been published by King Hussein (after reading that Allenby
had decorated Jaafar) without warning Feisal; to spite the northern
town-Arabs, the Syrian and Mesopotamian officers, whom the King at once
despised for their laxity and feared for their accomplishments. He knew
that they were fighting, not to give him dominion, but to set free their
own countries for their own governing, and the lust for power had grown
uncontrollable in the old man.</p>
<p>Jaafar came in and proffered his resignation to Feisal. There
followed him our divisional officers and their staffs, with the
regimental and battalion commanders. I begged them to pay no heed to the
humours of an old man of seventy, out of the world in Mecca, whose
greatness they themselves had made; and Feisal refused to accept their
resignations, pointing out that the commissions (since his father had
not approved their service) were issued by himself, and he alone was
discredited by the proclamation.</p>
<p>On this assumption he telegraphed to Mecca, and received a return
telegram which called him traitor and outlaw. He replied laying down his
command of the Akaba front. Hussein appointed Zeid to succeed him. Zeid
promptly refused. Hussein’s cipher messages became corrupt with rage,
and the military life of Aba el Lissan came to a sudden stop. Dawnay,
from Akaba, before the ship sailed, rang me up, and asked dolefully if
all hope were over. I answered that things hung on chance, but perhaps
we should get through.</p>
<p>Three courses lay before us. The first, to get pressure put on King
Hussein to withdraw his statement. The second, to carry on, ignoring it.
The third, to set up Feisal in formal independence of his father. There
were advocates of each course, amongst the English, as amongst the
Arabs. We wired to Allenby asking him to smooth out the incident.
Hussein was obstinate and crafty, and it might take weeks to force him
out of his obstacles to an apology. Normally, we could have afforded
three weeks; but to-day we were in the unhappy position that after three
days, if at all, our expedition to Deraa must start. We must find some
means of carrying on the war, while Egypt sought for a solution.</p>
<p>My first duty was to send express to Nuri Shaalan that I could not
meet him at the gathering of his tribes in Kaf, but would be in Azrak
from the first day of the new moon, at his service. This was a sad
expedient, for Nuri might take suspicion of my change and fail at the
tryst; and without the Rualla half our efficiency and importance at
Deraa on September the sixteenth would disappear. However, we had to
risk this smaller loss, since without Feisal and the regulars and
Pisani’s guns there would be no expedition, and for the sake of
reforming their tempers I must wait in Aba el Lissan.</p>
<p>My second duty was to start off the caravans for Azrak — the baggage,
the food, the petrol, the ammunition. Young prepared these, rising, as
ever, to any occasion not of his own seeking. He was his own first
obstacle, but would have no man hinder him. Never could I forget the
radiant face of Nuri Said, after a joint conference, encountering a
group of Arab officers with the cheerful words, ‘Never mind, you
fellows; he talks to the English just as he does to us!’ Now he saw that
each echelon started — not, indeed, to time but only a day late — under
its appointed officers, according to programme. It had been our
principle to issue orders to the Arabs only through their own chiefs, so
they had no precedent either for obedience or for disobedience: and off
they went like lambs.</p>
<p>My third duty was to face a mutiny of the troops. They had heard
false rumours about the crisis. Particularly, the gunners misunderstood,
and one afternoon fell out with their officers, and rushed off to turn
the guns on their tents. However, Rasim, the artillery commandant, had
forestalled them by collecting the breech-blocks into a pyramid inside
his tent. I took advantage of this comic moment to meet the men. They
were tense at first, but eventually out of curiosity they fell to
talking with me, who to them had been only an eccentric name, as a
half-Beduin Englishman.</p>
<p>I told them the coffee-cup storm which was raging among the high
heads, and they laughed merrily. Their faces were turned towards
Damascus, not Mecca, and they cared for nothing outside their army.
Their fear was that Feisal had deserted, since for days he had not been
out. I promised to bring him down instantly. When he, with Zeid, looking
as usual, drove through the lines in the Vauxhall, which Bols had had
painted specially green for him, their eyes convinced them of their
error.</p>
<p>My fourth duty was to start off the troops for Azrak on the right
day. To effect this, their confidence in the confidence of the officers
had to be restored. Stirling’s tact was called upon. Nuri Said was
ambitious, as any soldier would have been, to make much of the
opportunity before him, and readily agreed to move as far as Azrak,
pending Hussein’s apology. If this was unsatisfactory they could return,
or throw off allegiance; if it was adequate, as I assured him it would
be, the interim and unmerited services of the Northern Army should bring
a blush to the old man’s cheek.</p>
<p>The ranks responded to bluffer arguments. We made plain that such
gross questions as food and pay depended entirely on the maintenance of
organization. They yielded, and the separate columns, of mounted
infantry, of machine-gunners, of Egyptian sappers, of Ghurkas, of
Pisani’s gunners, moved off in their courses, according to the routine
of Stirling and Young, only two days late.</p>
<p>The last obligation was to restore Feisal’s supremacy. To attempt
anything serious between Deraa and Damascus without him would be vain.
We could put in the attack on Deraa, which was what Allenby expected
from us; but the capture of Damascus — which was what I expected from
the Arabs, the reason why I had joined with them in the field, taken ten
thousand pains, and spent my wit and strength — that depended on
Feisal’s being present with us in the fighting line, undistracted by
military duties, but ready to take over and exploit the political value
of what our bodies conquered for him. Eventually he offered to come up
under my orders.</p>
<p>As for the apology from Mecca, Allenby and Wilson were doing their
best, engrossing the cables. If they failed, my course would be to
promise Feisal the direct support of the British Government, and drive
him into Damascus as sovereign prince. It was possible: but I wanted to
avoid it except as a last necessity. The Arabs hitherto in their revolt
had made clean history, and I did not wish our adventure to come to the
pitiable state of scission before the common victory and its peace.</p>
<p>King Hussein behaved truly to type, protesting fluently, with endless
circumlocution, showing no understanding of the grave effect of his
incursion into Northern Army affairs. To clear his mind we sent him
plain statements, which drew abusive but involved returns. His telegrams
came through Egypt and by wireless to our operators in Akaba, and were
sent up to me by car, for delivery to Feisal. The Arabic ciphers were
simple, and I had undesirable passages mutilated by rearranging their
figures into nonsense, before handing them in code to Feisal. By this
easy expedient the temper of his entourage was not needlessly
complicated.</p>
<p>The play went on for several days, Mecca never repeating a message
notified corrupt, but telegraphing in its place a fresh version toned
down at each re-editing from the previous harshness. Finally, there came
a long message, the first half a lame apology and withdrawal of the
mischievous proclamation, the second half a repetition of the offence in
a new form. I suppressed the tail, and took the head marked ‘very
urgent’ to Feisal’s tent, where he sat in the full circle of his staff
officers.</p>
<p>His secretary worked out the despatch, and handed the decipher to
Feisal. My hints had roused expectation, and all eyes were on him as he
read it. He was astonished, and gazed wonderingly at me, for the meek
words were unlike his father’s querulous obstinacy. Then he pulled
himself together, read the apology aloud, and at the end said
thrillingly, ‘The telegraph has saved all our honour’.</p>
<p>A chorus of delight burst out, during which he bent aside to whisper
in my ear, ‘I mean the honour of nearly all of us’. It was done so
delightfully that I laughed, and said demurely, ‘I cannot understand
what you mean’. He replied, ‘I offered to serve for this last march
under your orders: why was that not enough?’ ‘Because it would not go
with your honour.’ He murmured, ‘You prefer mine always before your
own’, and then sprang energetically to his feet, saying, ‘Now, Sirs,
praise God and work’.</p>
<p>In three hours we had settled time-tables, and arranged for our
successors here in Aba el Lissan, with their spheres and duties. I took
my leave. Joyce had just returned to us from Egypt, and Feisal promised
that he would come, with him and Marshall, to Azrak to join me on the
twelfth at latest. All the camp was happy as I got into a Rolls tender
and set off northward, hoping yet to rally the Rualla under Nuri Shaalan
in time for our attack on Deraa.</p>

<p>XTHE HOUSE IS PERFECTED</p>
<p>Chapters CVII to CXXII</p>
<p>OUR mobile column of aeroplanes, armoured cars, Arab regulars and
Beduin collected at Azrak, to cut the three railways out of Deraa. The
southern line we cut near Mefrak; the northern at Arar; the western by
Mezerib. We circumnavigated Deraa, and rallied, despite air raids, in
the desert.</p>
<p>Next day Allenby attacked, and in a few hours had scattered the
Turkish armies beyond recovery.</p>
<p>I flew to Palestine for aeroplane help, and got orders for a second
phase of the thrust northward.</p>
<p>We moved behind Deraa to hasten its abandonment. General Barrow
joined us; in his company we advanced to Kiswe, and there met the
Australian Mounted Corps. Our united forces entered Damascus unopposed.
Some confusion manifested itself in the city. We strove to allay it;
Allenby arrived and smoothed out all difficulties. Afterwards he let me
go.</p>
