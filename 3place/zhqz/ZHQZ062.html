<h4 id="chapter-li">CHAPTER LI</h4>
<p>IN the night we lost our way among the stony ridges and valleys of
Dhuleil, but kept moving until dawn, so that half an hour after sunrise,
while the shadows were yet long across the green hollows, we had reached
our former watering-place, Khau, whose ruins broke from the hill-top
against Zerga like a scab. We were working hard at the two cisterns,
watering our camels for the return march to Bair, when a young
Circassian came in sight, driving three cows towards the rich green
pasture of the ruins.</p>
<p>This would not do, so Zaal sent off his too-energetic offenders of
the day previous to show their proper mettle by stalking him: and they
brought him in, unharmed, but greatly frightened. Circassians were
swaggering fellows, inordinate bullies in a clear road; but if firmly
met they cracked; and so this lad was in a head-and-tail flux of terror,
offending our sense of respect. We drenched him with water till he
recovered, and then in disposal set him to fight at daggers with a young
Sherari, caught stealing on the march; but after a scratch the prisoner
threw himself down weeping.</p>
<p>Now he was a nuisance, for if we left him he would give the alarm,
and send the horsemen of his village out against us. If we tied him up
in this remote place he would die of hunger or thirst; and, besides, we
had not rope to spare. To kill him seemed unimaginative: not worthy of a
hundred men. At last the Sherari boy said if we gave him scope he would
settle his account and leave him living.</p>
<p>He looped his wrist to the saddle and trotted him off with us for the
first hour, till he was dragging breathlessly. We were still near the
railway, but four or five miles from Zerga. There he was stripped of
presentable clothes, which fell, by point of honour, to his owner. The
Sherari threw him on his face, picked up his feet, drew a dagger, and
chopped him with it deeply across the soles. The Circassian howled with
pain and terror, as if he thought he was being killed.</p>
<p>Odd as was the performance, it seemed effective, and more merciful
than death. The cuts would make him travel to the railway on hands and
knees, a journey of an hour; and his nakedness would keep him in the
shadow of the rocks, till the sun was low. His gratitude was not
coherent; but we rode away, across undulations very rich in grazing. The
camels, with their heads down snatching plants and grass, moved
uncomfortably for us cocked over the chute of their sloped necks; yet we
must let them eat, since we were marching eighty miles a day, with halts
to breathe only in the brief gloamings of dawn and sunset.</p>
<p>Soon after daylight we turned west, and dismounted, short of the
railway among broken reefs of limestone, to creep carefully forward
until Atwi station lay beneath us. Its two stone houses (the first only
one hundred yards away) were in line, one obscuring the other. Men were
singing in them without disquietude. Their day was beginning, and from
the guard-room thin blue smoke curled into the air, while a soldier
drove out a flock of young sheep to crop the rich meadow between the
station and the valley.</p>
<p>This flock sealed the business, for after our horse-diet of dry corn
we craved meat. The Arabs’ teeth gritted as they counted ten, fifteen,
twenty-five, twenty-seven. Zaal dropped into the valley bed where the
line crossed a bridge, and, with a party in file behind him, crept along
till he faced the station across the meadow.</p>
<p>From our ridge we covered the station yard. We saw Zaal lean his
rifle on the bank, shielding his head with infinite precaution behind
grasses on the brink. He took slow aim at the coffee-sipping officers
and officials in shaded chairs, outside the ticket office. As he pressed
the trigger, the report overtook the crash of the bullet against the
stone wall, while the fattest man bowed slowly in his chair and sank to
the ground under the frozen stare of his fellows.</p>
<p>An instant later Zaal’s men poured in their volleys, broke from the
valley, and rushed forward: but the door of the northern house clanged
to, and rifles began to speak from behind its steel window shutters. We
replied, but soon saw our impotence, and ceased fire, as did the enemy.
The Sherarat drove the guilty sheep eastward into the hills, where were
the camels; everyone else ran down to join Zaal, who was busy about the
nearer and undefended building.</p>
<p>Near the height of plundering came a pause and panic. The Arabs were
such accustomed scouts that almost they felt danger before it came,
sense taking precautions before mind was persuaded. Swinging down the
line from the south was a trolley with four men, to whose ears the
grinding wheels had deadened our shots. The Rualla section crept under a
culvert three hundred yards up, while the rest of us crowded silently by
the bridge.</p>
<p>The trolley rolled unsuspectingly over the ambush, who came out to
line the bank behind, while we filed solemnly across the green in front.
The Turks slowed in horror, jumped off, and ran into the rough: but our
rifles cracked once more and they were dead. The trolley brought to our
feet its load of copper wire and telegraph tools, with which we put
‘earths’ in the long-distance wire. Zaal fired our half of the station,
whose petrol-splashed woodwork caught freely. The planks and cloth
hangings twisted and jerked convulsively as the flames licked them up.
Meanwhile the Ageyl were measuring out gelatine, and soon we lit their
charges and destroyed a culvert, many rails, and furlongs of telegraph.
With the roar of the first explosion our hundred knee-haltered camels
rose smartly to their feet, and at each following burst hopped more
madly on three legs till they shook off the rope-hitch about the fourth,
and drove out every way like scattered starlings into the void. Chasing
them and chasing the sheep took us three hours, for which graciously the
Turks gave law, or some of us would have had to walk home.</p>
<p>We put a few miles between us and the railway before we sat down to
our feast of mutton. We were short of knives, and, after killing the
sheep in relay, had recourse to stray flints to cut them up. As men
unaccustomed to such expedients, we used them in the eolithic spirit;
and it came to me that if iron had been constantly rare we should have
chipped our daily tools skilfully as palæoliths: whilst had we had no
metal whatever, our art would have been lavished on perfect and polished
stones. Our one hundred and ten men ate the best parts of twenty-four
sheep at the sitting, while the camels browsed about, or ate what we
left over; for the best riding-camels were taught to like cooked meat.
When it was finished we mounted, and rode through the night towards
Bair: which we entered without casualty, successful, well-fed, and
enriched, at dawn.</p>
