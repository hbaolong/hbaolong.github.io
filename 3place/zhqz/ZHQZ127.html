<h4 id="chapter-cxvi">CHAPTER CXVI</h4>
<p>NASIR, Nuri Shaalan and Talal had overshot us in the dark. Our joined
forces marched, with a heady breeze in the teeth, northward across the
ploughlands’ fat, happy villages. Over the harvested fields, whose straw
had been rather plucked than reaped, grew thistles, tall as a child, but
now yellow and dried and dead. The wind snapped them off at the hollow
root, and pitch-polled their branchy tops along the level ground,
thistle blowing against thistle and interlocking spines, till in huge
balls they careered like run-away haycocks across the fallow.</p>
<p>Arab women, out with their donkeys to fetch water, ran to us, crying
that an aeroplane had landed a while since, near by. It bore the round
rings of the Sherifian camel brand upon its body. Peake rode across, to
find two Australians whose Bristol had been hit in the radiator over
Deraa. They were glad, though astonished, to meet friends. After the
leak had been plugged, we levied water from the women, to fill them up,
and they flew home safely.</p>
<p>Men rode up every minute and joined us, while from each village the
adventurous young ran out afoot to enter our ranks. As we moved on, so
closely knit in the golden sunlight, we were able, in rare chance, to
see ourselves as a whole: quickly we became a character, an organism, in
whose pride each of us was uplifted. We cracked bawdy jokes to set off
the encompassing beauty.</p>
<p>At noon we entered water-melon fields. The army ran upon them, while
we spied out the line, which lay desertedly quivering in the sunlight
ahead. As we watched a train passed down. Only last night had the
railway been mended: and this was the third train. We moved without
opposition upon the line in a horde two miles across, and began hastily
to blow up things, anyone who had explosive using it as he fancied. Our
hundreds of novices were full of zeal and the demolitions, albeit
uninstructed, were wide.</p>
<p>Clearly our return had surprised the dazed enemy: we must extend and
improve this chance. So we went to Nuri Shaalan, Auda, and Talal, and
asked what local effort each would undertake. Talal, the energetic,
would attack Ezraa, the big grain depot to the north: Auda was for
Khirbet el Ghazala, the corresponding station southward: Nuri would
sweep his men down the main road, towards Deraa, on chance of Turkish
parties.</p>
<p>These were three good ideas. The chiefs went to put them into being,
while we, pulling our column to its shape again, pursued our road past
the ruined colony of Sheikh Miskin, very gaunt in the moonlight. Its
obstacle of water ditches muddled our thousands, so that we halted on
the stubble plain beyond, for dawn. Some made fires against the
penetrating mist of this clay Hauran: others slept as they were on the
dew-slimy ground. Lost men went about calling their friends, in that
sharp, full-throated wail of the Arab villager. The moon had set, and
the world was black and very cold.</p>
<p>I roused my bodyguard, who rode so briskly that we entered Sheikh
Saad with the dawn. As we passed between the rocks into the field behind
the trees, the earth sprang to life again with the new sun. The morning
airs flashed the olive-yards to silver, and men from a great goat-hair
tent on the right called us to guest with them. We asked whose camp it
was. ‘Ibn Smeir’s’ they replied. This threatened complications. Rashid
was an enemy of Nuri Shaalan’s, unreconciled, chance-met. At once we
sent a warning to Nasir. Fortunately Ibn Smeir was absent. So his family
would be our temporary guests, and Nuri, as host, must observe the
rules.</p>
<p>It was a relief, for already in our ranks we had hundreds of deadly
enemies, their feuds barely suspended by Feisal’s peace. The strain of
keeping them in play, and employing their hot-heads in separate spheres,
balancing opportunity and service that our direction might be esteemed
as above jealousy — all that was evil enough. Conduct of the war in
France would have been harder if each division, almost each brigade of
our army had hated every other with a deadly hatred and fought when they
met suddenly. However, we had kept them quiet for two years, and it
would be only a few days now.</p>
<p>The parties of the night returned, full of spoil. Ezraa had been
feebly held by Abd el Kader, the Algerian, with his retainers, some
volunteers and troops. When Talal came the volunteers joined him, the
troops fled, and the retainers were so few that Abd el Kader had to
abandon the place without fighting. Our men were too heavy with their
great booty to catch him.</p>
<p>Auda came, boasting. He had taken el Ghazale by storm, capturing a
derelict train, guns and two hundred men, of whom some were Germans.
Nuri Shaalan reported four hundred prisoners with mules and
machine-guns. The rank and file of Turks had been farmed out to remote
villages, to earn their keep.</p>
<p>An English aeroplane flew round and round, wondering if we were the
Arab force. Young spread out ground signals, and to him they dropped a
message that Bulgaria had surrendered to the Allies. We had not known
there was an offensive in the Balkans, so the news came orphaned, and as
it were insignificant to us. Undoubtedly the end, not only of the great
war, but of our war, was near. A sharp effort, and our trial would be
over and everyone loosed back to his affairs, forgetting the madness:
since for most of us it was the first war, and we looked to its end as
rest and peace.</p>
<p>The army had arrived. The groves became thronged as each detachment
picked out the best vacant place and unsaddled, whether beside
fig-trees, or under palms, or olives, from which the birds burst out in
frightened clouds, with a multitudinous crying. Our men took their
animals to the stream meandering through green bushes and flowers and
cultivated fruits, things strange to us during the years of our
wandering in the flinty desert.</p>
<p>The people of Sheikh Saad came shyly to look at Feisal’s army, which
had been a whispered legendary thing, and was now in their village, led
by renowned or formidable names — Talal, Nasir, Nuri, Auda. We stared
back, in secret envy of their peasant life.</p>
<p>While the men stretched the saddle-stiffness of riding from their
legs, we went up, five or six of us, above the ruins, whence across the
southern plain we should see the measure of security in store for us. To
our astonishment we perceived, just over the walls, a thin company of
regulars in uniform — Turks, Austrians, Germans — with eight
machine-guns on pack-animals. They were toiling up from Galilee towards
Damascus after their defeat by Allenby; hopeless, but care-free,
marching at ease, thinking themselves fifty miles from any war.</p>
<p>We did not give an alarm, to spare our tired troops pains: just Durzi
ibn Dughmi, with the Khaffaji and others of the family, mounted quietly
and fell on them from a narrow lane. The officers showed fight and were
instantly killed. The men threw down their arms, and in five minutes had
been searched and robbed and were being shepherded in file along the
water-paths between the gardens to an open pound which seemed fit for
our prison. Sheikh Saad was paying soon and well.</p>
<p>Away to the east appeared three or four black knots of people, moving
northward. We loosed the Howeitat on them, and after an hour they
returned in laughter, each man leading a mule or pack-horse; poor,
tired, galled brutes, showing all too clearly the straits of the beaten
army. Their riders had been unarmed soldiers fleeing from the British.
The Howeitat disdained to make such prisoners. ‘We gave them to the boys
and girls of the villages for servants,’ sneered Zaal, with his
thin-lipped smile.</p>
<p>News came to us from the west that small companies of Turks were
retiring into the local villages from Chauvel’s attacks. We sent against
them armed parties of Naim, a peasant tribe which had joined us last
night at Sheikh Miskin, as appointed by Nasir, to do what they could.
The mass rising we had so long prepared was now in flood, rising higher
as each success armed more rebels. In two days’ time we might have sixty
thousand armed men in movement.</p>
<p>We snapped up further trifles on the Damascus road; and then saw
heavy smoke above the hill which hid Deraa. A man cantered in, to inform
Tallal that the Germans had set fire to aeroplanes and storehouses, and
stood ready to evacuate the town. A British plane dropped word that
Barrow’s troops were near Remtha, and that two Turkish columns, one of
four thousand, one of two thousand, were retiring towards us from Deraa
and Mezerib respectively.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that these six thousand men were all that remained of
the Fourth Army, from Deraa, and of the Seventh Army, which had been
disputing Barrow’s advance. With their destruction would end our purpose
here. Yet, till we knew, we must retain Sheikh Saad. So the larger
column, the four thousand, we would let pass, only fastening to them
Khalid and his Rualla, with some northern peasantry, to harry their
flanks and rear.</p>
