<h4 id="chapter-lvii">CHAPTER LVII</h4>
<p>UPON Clayton I opened myself completely. Akaba had been taken on my
plan by my effort. The cost of it had fallen on my brains and nerves.
There was much more I felt inclined to do, and capable of doing — if he
thought I had earned the right to be my own master. The Arabs said that
each man believed his ticks to be gazelles: I did, fervently.</p>
<p>Clayton agreed they were spirited and profitable ticks; but objected
that actual command could not be given to an officer junior to the rest.
He suggested Joyce as commanding officer at Akaba: a notion which suited
me perfectly. Joyce was a man in whom one could rest against the world:
a serene, unchanging, comfortable spirit. His mind, like a pastoral
landscape, had four corners to its view: cared-for, friendly, limited,
displayed.</p>
<p>He had won golden opinion at Rabegh and Wejh, practising that very
labour of building up an army and a base, which would be necessary at
Akaba. Clayton-like, he was a good cartilage to set between opposing
joints, but he had more laughter than Clayton, being broad and Irish and
much over six feet in height. His nature was to be devoted to the
nearest job without straining on his toes after longer horizons. Also,
he was more patient than any recorded archangel, and only smiled that
jolly smile of his whenever I came in with revolutionary schemes, and
threw new ribbons of fancy about the neck of the wild thing he was
slowly rearing.</p>
<p>The rest was easy. For supply officer we would have Goslett, the
London business man who had made chaotic Wejh so prim. The aeroplanes
could not yet be moved; but the armoured cars might come straight away,
and a guard-ship if the Admiral was generous. We rang up Sir Rosslyn
Wemyss, who was very generous: his flagship, the Euryalus, should sit
there for the first few weeks.</p>
<p>Genius, this was, for in Arabia ships were esteemed by number of
funnels, and the Euryalus, with four, was exceptional in ships. Her
great reputation assured the mountains that we were indeed the winning
side: and her huge crew, by the prompting of Everard Feilding, for fun
built us a good pier.</p>
<p>On the Arab side, I asked that the expensive and difficult Wejh be
closed down, and Feisal come to Akaba with his full army. A sudden
demand, it seemed to Cairo. So I went further, pointing out that the
Yenbo-Medina sector also became a back-number; and advised the transfer
to Akaba of the stores, money, and officers now devoted to Ali and
Abdulla. This was ruled to be impossible. But my wish regarding Wejh was
granted me in compromise.</p>
<p>Then I showed that Akaba was Allenby’s right flank, only one hundred
miles from his centre, but eight hundred miles from Mecca. As the Arabs
prospered their work would be done more and more in the Palestine
sphere. So it was logical that Feisal be transferred from the area of
King Hussein to become an army commander of the Allied expedition of
Egypt under Allenby.</p>
<p>This idea held difficulties. ‘Would Feisal accept?’ I had talked it
over with him in Wejh months ago. ‘The High Commissioner?’ Feisal’s army
had been the largest and most distinguished of the Hejaz units: its
future would not be dull. General Wingate had assumed full
responsibility for the Arab Movement in its darkest moment, at great
risk in reputation: dare we ask him to relinquish its advance-guard now
on the very threshold of success?</p>
<p>Clayton, knowing Wingate very well, was not afraid to broach the idea
to him: and Wingate replied promptly that if Allenby could make direct
and large use of Feisal, it would be both his duty and his pleasure to
give him up for the good of the show.</p>
<p>A third difficulty of the transfer might be King Hussein: an
obstinate, narrow-minded, suspicious character, little likely to
sacrifice a pet vanity for unity of control. His opposition would
endanger the scheme: and I offered to go down to talk him over, calling
on the way to get from Feisal such recommendations of the change as
should fortify the powerful letters which Wingate was writing to the
King. This was accepted. The Dufferin, on returning from Akaba, was
detailed to take me to Jidda for the new mission.</p>
<p>She took two days to reach Wejh. Feisal, with Joyce, Newcombe, and
all the army, was at Jeida, one hundred miles inland. Stent, who had
succeeded Ross in command of the Arabian flight, sent me up by air; so
we crossed comfortably at sixty miles an hour the hills learned
toilsomely on camel-back.</p>
<p>Feisal was eager to hear the details of Akaba, and laughed at our
prentice wars. We sat and made plans the whole night. He wrote to his
father; ordered his camel corps to march upon Akaba forthwith; and made
first arrangements towards getting Jaafar Pasha and his army ferried up
in the long-suffering Hardinge.</p>
<p>At dawn they flew me back to Wejh, and, an hour after, the Dufferin
was making for Jidda, where things became easy for me with Wilson’s
powerful help. To render Akaba, our most promising sector, strong, he
sent up a shipload of reserve stores and ammunition, and offered us any
of his officers. Wilson was of the Wingate school.</p>
<p>The King came down from Mecca and talked discursively. Wilson was the
royal touchstone, by which to try doubtful courses. Thanks to him, the
proposed transfer of Feisal to Allenby was accepted at once, King
Hussein taking the opportunity to stress his complete loyalty to our
alliance. Then, changing his subject, as usual without obvious
coherence, he began to expose his religious position, neither strong
Shia nor strong Sunni, aiming rather at a simple pre-schism
interpretation of the faith. In foreign politics he betrayed a mind as
narrow as it had been broad in unworldly things; with much of that
destructive tendency of little men to deny the honesty of opponents. I
grasped something of the fixed jealousy which made the modern Feisal
suspect in his father’s court; and realized how easily mischief-makers
could corrode the King.</p>
<p>While we played so interestingly at Jidda, two abrupt telegrams from
Egypt shattered our peace. The first reported that the Howeitat were in
treasonable correspondence with Maan. The second connected Auda with the
plot. This dismayed us. Wilson had travelled with Auda, and formed the
inevitable judgement of his perfect sincerity: yet Mohammed el Dheilan
was capable of double play, and ibn Jad and his friends were still
uncertain. We prepared to leave at once for Akaba. Treachery had not
been taken into account when Nasir and I had built our plan for the
town’s defence.</p>
<p>Fortunately the Hardinge was in harbour for us. On the third
afternoon we were in Akaba, where Nasir had no notion that anything was
wrong. I told him only of my wish to greet Auda: he lent me a swift
camel and a guide; and at dawn we found Auda and Mohammed and Zaal all
in a tent at Guweira. They were confused when I dropped in on them,
unheralded; but protested that all was well. We fed together as
friends.</p>
<p>Others of the Howeitat came in, and there was gay talk about the war.
I distributed the King’s presents; and told them, to their laughter,
that Nasir had got his month’s leave to Mecca. The King, an enthusiast
for the revolt, believed that his servants should work as manfully. So
he would not allow visits to Mecca, and the poor men found continual
military service heavy banishment from their wives. We had jested a
hundred times that, if he took Akaba, Nasir would deserve a holiday; but
he had not really believed in its coming until I gave him Hussein’s
letter the evening before. In gratitude he sold me Ghazala, the regal
camel he won from the Howeitat. As her owner I became of new interest to
the Abu Tayi.</p>
<p>After lunch, by pretence of sleep, I got rid of the visitors; and
then abruptly asked Auda and Mohammed to walk with me to see the ruined
fort and reservoir. When we were alone I touched on their present
correspondence with the Turks. Auda began to laugh; Mohammed to look
disgusted. At last they explained elaborately that Mohammed had taken
Auda’s seal and written to the Governor of Maan, offering to desert the
Sherif’s cause. The Turk had replied gladly, promising great rewards.
Mohammed asked for something on account. Auda then heard of it, waited
till the messenger with presents was on his way, caught him, robbed him
to the skin: and was denying Mohammed a share of the spoils. A farcical
story, and we laughed rightly over it: but there was more behind.</p>
<p>They were angry that no guns or troops had yet come to their support;
and that no rewards had been given them for taking Akaba. They were
anxious to know how I had learnt of their secret dealings, and how much
more I knew. We were on a slippery ledge. I played on their fear by my
unnecessary amusement, quoting in careless laughter, as if they were my
own words, actual phrases of the letters they had exchanged. This
created the impression desired.</p>
<p>Parenthetically I told them Feisal’s entire army was coming up; and
how Allenby was sending rifles, guns, high explosive, food and money to
Akaba. Finally I suggested that Auda’s present expenses in hospitality
must be great; would it help if I advanced something of the great gift
Feisal would make him, personally, when he arrived? Auda saw that the
immediate moment would not be unprofitable: that Feisal would be highly
profitable: and that the Turks would be always with him if other
resources failed. So he agreed, in a very good temper, to accept my
advance; and with it to keep the Howeitat well-fed and cheerful.</p>
<p>It was near sunset. Zaal had killed a sheep and we ate again in real
amity. Afterwards I remounted, with Mufaddih (to draw Auda’s allowance),
and Abd el Rahman, a servant of Mohammed’s who, so he whispered me,
would receive any little thing I wished to send him separately. We rode
all night towards Akaba, where I roused Nasir from sleep, to run over
our last business. Then I paddled out in a derelict canoe from ‘Euryalus
jetty’ to the Hardinge just as the first dawn crept down the western
peaks.</p>
<p>I went below, bathed, and slept till mid-morning. When I came on deck
the ship was rushing grandly down the narrow gulf under full steam for
Egypt. My appearance caused a sensation, for they had not dreamed I
could reach Guweira, assure myself, and get back in less than six or
seven days, to catch a later steamer.</p>
<p>We rang up Cairo and announced that the situation at Guweira was
thoroughly good, and no treachery abroad. This may have been hardly
true; but since Egypt kept us alive by stinting herself, we must reduce
impolitic truth to keep her confident and ourselves a legend. The crowd
wanted book-heroes, and would not understand how more human old Auda was
because, after battle and murder, his heart yearned towards the defeated
enemy now subject, at his free choice, to be spared or killed; and
therefore never so lovely.</p>
