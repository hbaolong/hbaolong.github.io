<h4 id="chapter-l">CHAPTER L</h4>
<p>XXHOWEVER the Arab Movement lived on Allenby’s good pleasure, so it
was needful to undertake some operation, less than a general revolt, in
the enemy rear: an operation which could be achieved by a raiding party
without involving the settled peoples; and yet one which would please
him by being of material help to the British pursuit of the enemy. These
conditions and qualifications pointed, upon consideration, to an
attempted cutting of one of the great bridges in the Yarmuk valley.</p>
<p>It was by the narrow and precipitous gorge of the River Yarmuk that
the railway from Palestine climbed to Hauran, on its way to Damascus.
The depth of the Jordan depression, and the abruptness of the eastern
plateau-face made this section of the line most difficult to build. The
engineers had to lay it in the very course of the winding river-valley:
and to gain its development the line had to cross and recross the stream
continually by a series of bridges, the farthest west and the farthest
east of which were hardest to replace.</p>
<p>To cut either of these bridges would isolate the Turkish army in
Palestine, for one fortnight, from its base in Damascus, and destroy its
power of escaping from Allenby’s advance. To reach the Yarmuk we should
need to ride from Akaba, by way of Azrak, some four hundred and twenty
miles. The Turks thought the danger from us so remote that they guarded
the bridges insufficiently.</p>
<p>Accordingly we suggested the scheme to Allenby, who asked that it be
done on November the fifth, or one of the three following days. If it
succeeded, and the weather held up afterwards for a fortnight, the odds
were that no coherent unit of von Kress’s army would survive its retreat
to Damascus. The Arabs would then have their opportunity to carry their
wave forward into the great capital, taking up at the halfway point from
the British, whose original impulse would then be nearly exhausted, with
the exhaustion of their transport.</p>
<p>For such an eventuality we needed at Azrak an authority to lead the
potential local adherents. Nasir, our usual pioneer, was absent: but out
with the Beni Sakhr was Ali ibn el Hussein, the youthful and attractive
Harith Sherif, who had distinguished himself in Feisal’s early desperate
days about Medina, and later had out-newcombed Newcombe about el
Ula.</p>
<p>Ali, having been Jemal’s guest in Damascus, had learned something of
Syria: so I begged a loan of him from Feisal. His courage, his resource,
and his energy were proven. There had never been any adventure, since
our beginning, too dangerous for Ali to attempt, nor a disaster too deep
for him to face with his high yell of a laugh.</p>
<p>He was physically splendid: not tall nor heavy, but so strong that he
would kneel down, resting his forearms palm-up on the ground, and rise
to his feet with a man on each hand. In addition, Ali could outstrip a
trotting camel on his bare feet, keep his speed over half a mile and
then leap into the saddle. He was impertinent, headstrong, conceited; as
reckless in word as in deed; impressive (if he pleased) on public
occasions, and fairly educáted for a person whose native ambition was to
excel the nomads of the desert in war and sport.</p>
<p>Ali would bring us the Beni Sakhr. We had good hopes of the Serahin,
the tribe at Azrak. I was in touch with the Beni Hassan. The Rualla, of
course, at this season were away at their winter quarters, so that our
greatest card in the Hauran could not be played. Faiz el Ghusein had
gone into the Lejah to prepare for action against the Hauran Railway if
the signal came. Explosives were stored in desirable places. Our friends
in Damascus were warned; and Ali Riza Pasha Rikabi, the city’s military
governor for the innocent Turks, and at the same time chief agent and
conspirator for the Sherif, took quiet steps to retain control if the
emergency arose.</p>
<p>My detailed plan was to rush from Azrak, under guidance of Rafa (that
most gallant sheikh who had convoyed me in June), to Um Keis, in one or
two huge marches with a handful of, perhaps, fifty men. Um Keis was
Gadara, very precious with its memories of Menippus and of Meleager, the
immoral Greek-Syrian whose self-expression marked the highest point of
Syrian letters. It stood just over the westernmost of the Yarmuk
bridges, a steel masterpiece whose destruction would fairly enrol me in
the Gadarene school. Only half a dozen sentries were stationed actually
on the girders and abutments. Reliefs for them were supplied from a
garrison of sixty, in the station buildings of Hemme, where the hot
springs of Gadara yet gushed out to the advantage of local sick. My hope
was to persuade some of the Abu Tayi under Zaal to come with me. These
men-wolves would make certain the actual storming of the bridge. To
prevent enemy reinforcements coming up we would sweep the approaches
with machine-guns, handled by Captain Bray’s Indian volunteers from the
cavalry division in France, under Jemadar Hassan Shah, a firm and
experienced man. They had been months up country, rail-cutting, from
Wejh, and might fairly be assumed to have become experts on camel-back,
fit for the forced marches in prospect.</p>
<p>The demolition of great underslung girders with limited weights of
explosive was a precise operation, and demanded a necklace of blasting
gelatine, fired electrically. The Humber made us canvas straps and
buckles, to simplify the fixing. None the less, the job remained a
difficult one to do under fire. For fear of a casualty, Wood, the base
engineer at Akaba, the only sapper available, was invited to come along
and double me. He immediately agreed, though knowing he had been
condemned medically for active service as the result of a bullet through
the head in France. George Lloyd, who was spending a last few days in
Akaba before going to Versailles on a regretted inter-allied Commission,
said that he would ride up with us to Jefer: as he was one of the best
fellows and least obtrusive travellers alive, his coming added greatly
to our forlorn anticipation.</p>
<p>We were making our last preparations when an unexpected ally arrived
in Emir Abd el Kader el Jezairi, grandson of the chivalrous defender of
Algiers against the French. The exiled family had lived in Damascus for
a generation. One of them, Omar, had been hanged by Jemal for treason
disclosed in the Picot papers. The others had been deported, and Abd el
Kader told us a long story of his escape from Brusa, and his journey,
with a thousand adventures, across Anatolia to Damascus. In reality, he
had been enlarged by the Turks upon request of the Khedive Abbas Hilmi,
and sent down by him on private business to Mecca. He went there, saw
King Hussein, and came back with a crimson banner, and noble gifts, his
crazy mind half persuaded of our right, and glowing jerkily with
excitement.</p>
<p>To Feisal he offered the bodies and souls of his villagers, sturdy,
hard-smiting Algerian exiles living compactly along the north bank of
the Yarmuk. We seized at the chance this would give us to control for a
little time the middle section of the Valley railway, including two or
three main bridges, without the disability of raising the country-side;
since the Algerians were hated strangers and the Arab peasantry would
not join them. Accordingly, we put off calling Rafa to meet us at Azrak,
and said not a word to Zaal, concentrating our thoughts instead on Wadi
Khalid and its bridges.</p>
<p>While we were in this train of mind arrived a telegram from Colonel
Bremond, warning us that Abd el Kader was a spy in pay of the Turks. It
was disconcerting. We watched him narrowly, but found no proof of the
charge, which was not to be accepted blindly, as from Bremond, who was
more a liability than our colleague; his military temper might have
carried away his judgement when he heard Abd el Kader’s outspoken public
and private denunciations of France. The French conception of their
country as a fair woman lent to them a national spitefulness against
those who scorned her charms.</p>
<p>Feisal told Abd el Kader to ride with Ali and myself, and said to me,
‘I know he is mad. I think he is honest. Guard your heads and use him.’
We carried on, showing him our complete confidence, on the principle
that a crook would not credit our honesty, and that an honest man was
made a crook soonest by suspicion. As a matter of fact, he was an
Islamic fanatic, half-insane with religious enthusiasm and a most
violent belief in himself. His Moslem susceptibilities were outraged by
my undisguised Christianity. His pride was hurt by our companionship;
for the tribes greeted Ali as greater, and treated me as better, than
himself. His bullet-headed stupidity broke down Ali’s self-control twice
or thrice into painful scenes: while his final effort was to leave us in
the lurch at a desperate moment, after hindering our march and upsetting
ourselves and our plans as far as he could.</p>
