<h4 id="chapter-xl">CHAPTER XL</h4>
<p>TO townsmen this garden was a memory of the world before we went mad
with war and drove ourselves into the desert: to Auda there was an
indecency of exhibition in the plant-richness, and he longed for an
empty view. So we cut short our second night in paradise, and at two in
the morning went on up the valley. It was pitch dark, the very stars in
the sky being unable to cast light into the depths where we were
wandering. To-night Auda was guide, and to make us sure of him he lifted
up his voice in an interminable ‘ho, ho, ho’ song of the Howeitat; an
epic chanted on three bass notes, up and down, back and forward, in so
round a voice that the words were indistinguishable. After a little we
thanked him for the singing, since the path went away to the left, and
our long line followed his turn by the echoes of his voice rolling about
the torn black cliffs in the moonlight.</p>
<p>On this long journey Sherif Nasir and Auda’s sour-smiling cousin,
Mohammed el Dheilan, took pains with my Arabic, giving me by turn
lessons in the classical Medina tongue, and in the vivid desert
language. At the beginning my Arabic had been a halting command of the
tribal dialects of the Middle Euphrates (a not impure form), but now it
became a fluent mingling of Hejaz slang and north-tribal poetry with
household words and phrases from the limpid Nejdi, and book forms from
Syria. The fluency had a lack of grammar, which made my talk a perpetual
adventure for my hearers. Newcomers imagined I must be the native of
some unknown illiterate district; a shot-rubbish ground of disjected
Arabic parts of speech.</p>
<p>However, as yet I understood not three words of Auda’s, and after
half an hour his chant tired me, while the old moon climbed slowly up
the sky, sailed over the topmost hills and threw a deceitful light, less
sure than darkness, into our valley. We marched until the early sun,
very trying to those who had ridden all night, opposed us.</p>
<p>Breakfast was off our own flour, thus lightening at last, after days
of hospitality, our poor camels’ food-load. Sharraf being not yet in Abu
Raga, we made no more of haste than water-difficulties compelled; and,
after food, again put up our blanket roofs and lay till afternoon,
fretfully dodging after their unstable shadow, getting moist with heat
and the constant pricking of flies.</p>
<p>At last Nasir gave the marching signal, and we went on up the defile,
with slightly pompous hills each side, for four hours; when we agreed to
camp again in the valley bed. There was abundant brushwood for fuel; and
up the cliff on our right were rock-pools of fresh water, which gave us
a delicious drink. Nasir was wrought up; he commanded rice for supper,
and the friends to feed with us.</p>
<p>Our rule of march was odd and elaborate. Nasir, Auda, and Nesib were
so many separate, punctilious houses, admitting the supremacy of Nasir
only because I lived with him as a guest and furnished them with the
example of respect. Each required to be consulted on the details of our
going, and where and when we should halt. This was inevitable with Auda,
a child of battle who had never known a master, since, as a tiny boy, he
had first ridden his own camel. It was advisable with Nesib, a Syrian of
the queasy Syrian race; jealous; hostile to merit, or to its
acknowledgement.</p>
<p>Such people demanded a war-cry and banner from outside to combine
them, and a stranger to lead them, one whose supremacy should be based
on an idea: illogical, undeniable, discriminant: which instinct might
accept and reason find no rational basis to reject or approve. For this
army of Feisal’s the conceit was that an Emir of Mecca, a descendant of
the prophet, a Sherif, was an other-worldly dignitary whom sons of Adam
might reverence without shame. This was the binding assumption of the
Arab movement; it was this which gave it an effective, if imbecile
unanimity.</p>
<p>In the morning we rode at five. Our valley pinched together, and we
went round a sharp spur, ascending steeply. The track became a bad
goat-path, zigzagging up a hill-side too precipitous to climb except on
all fours. We dropped off our camels and led them by the headstalls.
Soon we had to help each other, a man urging the camels from behind,
another pulling them from the front, encouraging them over the worst
places, adjusting their loads to ease them.</p>
<p>Parts of the track were dangerous, where rocks bulged out and
narrowed it, so that the near half of the load grazed and forced the
animal to the cliff-edge. We had to re-pack the food and explosives;
and, in spite of all our care, lost two of our feeble camels in the
pass. The Howeitat killed them where they lay broken, stabbing a keen
dagger into the throat-artery near the chest, while the neck was
strained tight by pulling the head round to the saddle. They were at
once cut up and shared out as meat.</p>
<p>The head of the pass we were glad to find not a range but a spacious
plateau which sloped slowly before us to the east. The first yards were
rough and rocky, overgrown with low mats of thorns like ling; but
afterwards we came to a valley of white shingle, in whose bed a Beduin
woman was filling her water-skin with a copper cup, ladling milky water,
quite pure and sweet, from a little hole a foot wide, scraped elbow deep
in the pebbles. This was Abu Saad, and for its name’s sake and for its
water, and the joints of red meat bumping on our saddles, we settled we
would stay here one night, filling up yet more of the time which must be
filled before Sharraf came back from his expedition against the
railway.</p>
<p>So we rode on four more miles, to camp under spreading trees, in
close-grown thickets of thorn-scrub, hollow underneath like booths. By
day these made tent-ribs for our blankets stretched against the
masterful sun. At night they were bowers for our sleeping-places. We had
learned to sleep with nothing overhead but moon and stars, and nothing
either side to keep distant the winds and noises of the night; and by
contrast it was strange, but quieting, to rest within walls, with a roof
above; even though walls and roof were only interlacing twigs making a
darker mesh against the star-scattered sky.</p>
<p>For myself, I was ill again; a fever increasing upon me, and my body
very sore with boils and the rubbing of my sweaty saddle. When Nasir,
without my prompting, had halted at the half-stage, I turned and thanked
him warmly, to his astonishment. We were now on the limestone of the
Shefa crest. Before us lay a great dark lava-field, and short of it a
range of red and black banded sandstone cliffs with conical tops. The
air on the high tableland was not so warm; and morning and evening there
blew across us a free current which was refreshing after the suspended
stillness of the valleys.</p>
<p>We breakfasted on our camel meat, and started more gaily the next
morning down a gently-falling plateau of red sandstone. Then we came to
the first break of surface, a sharp passage to the bottom of a
shrub-grown, sandy valley, on each side of which sandstone precipices
and pinnacles, gradually growing in height as we went down, detached
themselves sharply against the morning sky. It was shadowed in the
bottom, and the air tasted wet and decayed, as though sap was drying out
into it. The edges of the cliffs about us were clipped strangely, like
fantastic parapets. We wound on, ever deeper into the earth until, half
an hour later, by a sharp corner we entered Wadi Jizil, the main gutter
of these sandstone regions, whose end we had seen near Hedia.</p>
<p>Jizil was a deep gorge some two hundred yards in width, full of
tamarisk sprouting from the bed of drifted sand, as well as from the
soft twenty-foot banks, heaped up wherever an eddy in flood or wind had
laid the heavier dust under the returns of cliffs. The walls each side
were of regular bands of sandstone, streaked red in many shades. The
union of dark cliffs, pink floors, and pale green shrubbery was
beautiful to eyes sated with months of sunlight and sooty shadow. When
evening came, the declining sun crimsoned one side of the valley with
its glow, leaving the other in purple gloom.</p>
<p>Our camp was on some swelling dunes of weedy sand in an elbow of the
valley, where a narrow cleft had set up a back-wash and scooped out a
basin in which a brackish remnant of last winter’s flood was caught. We
sent a man for news up the valley to an oleander thicket where we saw
the white peaks of Sharraf’s tents. They expected him next day; so we
passed two nights in this strange-coloured, echoing place. The brackish
pool was fit for our camels, and in it we bathed at noon. Then we ate
and slept generously, and wandered in the nearer valleys to see the
horizontal stripes of pink and brown and cream and red which made up the
general redness of the cliffs, delighting in the varied patterns of thin
pencillings of lighter or darker tint which were drawn over the plain
body of rock. One afternoon I spent behind some shepherd’s fold of
sandstone blocks in warm soft air and sunlight, with a low burden of the
wind plucking at the rough wall-top above my head. The valley was
instinct with peace, and the wind’s continuing noise made even it seem
patient.</p>
<p>My eyes were shut and I was dreaming, when a youthful voice made me
see an anxious Ageyli, a stranger, Daud, squatting by me. He appealed
for my compassion. His friend Farraj had burned their tent in a frolic,
and Saad, captain of Sharraf’s Ageyl, was going to beat him in
punishment. At my intercession he would be released. Saad happened, just
then, to visit me, and I put it to him, while Daud sat watching us, his
mouth slightly, eagerly, open; his eyelids narrowed over large, dark
eyes, and his straight brows furrowed with anxiety. Daud’s pupils, set a
little in from the centre of the eyeball, gave him an air of acute
readiness.</p>
<p>Saad’s reply was not comforting. The pair were always in trouble, and
of late so outrageous in their tricks that Sharraf, the severe, had
ordered an example to be made of them. All he could do for my sake was
to let Daud share the ordained sentence. Daud leaped at the chance,
kissed my hand and Saad’s, and ran off up the valley; while Saad,
laughing, told me stories of the famous pair. They were an instance of
the eastern boy and boy affection which the segregation of women made
inevitable. Such friendships often led to manly loves of a depth and
force beyond our flesh-steeped conceit. When innocent they were hot and
unashamed. If sexuality entered, they passed into a give and take,
unspiritual relation, like marriage.</p>
<p>Next day Sharraf did not come. Our morning passed with Auda talking
of the march in front, while Nasir with forefinger and thumb flicked
sputtering matches from the box across his tent at us. In the midst of
our merriment two bent figures, with pain in their eyes, but crooked
smiles upon their lips, hobbled up and saluted. These were Daud the
hasty and his love-fellow, Farraj; a beautiful, soft-framed, girlish
creature, with innocent, smooth face and swimming eyes. They said they
were for my service. I had no need of them; and objected that after
their beating they could not ride. They replied they had now come
bare-backed. I said I was a simple man who disliked servants about him.
Daud turned away, defeated and angry; but Farraj pleaded that we must
have men, and they would follow me for company and out of gratitude.
While the harder Daud revolted, he went over to Nasir and knelt in
appeal, all the woman of him evident in his longing. At the end, on
Nasir’s advice, I took them both, mainly because they looked so young
and clean.</p>
