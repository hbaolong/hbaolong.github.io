<h4 id="chapter-xxxii">CHAPTER XXXII</h4>
<p>DAWN found us crossing a steep short pass out of Wadi Kitan into the
main drainage valley of these succeeding hills. We turned aside into
Wadi Reimi, a tributary, to get water. There was no proper well, only a
seepage hole in the stony bed of the valley; and we found it partly by
our noses: though the taste, while as foul, was curiously unlike the
smell. We refilled our water-skins. Arslan baked bread, and we rested
for two hours. Then we went on through Wadi Amk, an easy green valley
which made comfortable marching for the camels.</p>
<p>When the Amk turned westward we crossed it, going up between piles of
the warped grey granite (like cold toffee) which was common up-country
in the Hejaz. The defile culminated at the foot of a natural ramp and
staircase: badly broken, twisting, and difficult for camels, but short.
Afterwards we were in an open valley for an hour, with low hills to the
right and mountains to the left. There were water pools in the crags,
and Merawin tents under the fine trees which studded the flat. The
fertility of the slopes was great: on them grazed flocks of sheep and
goats. We got milk from the Arabs: the first milk my Ageyl had been
given in the two years of drought.</p>
<p>The track out of the valley when we reached its head was execrable,
and the descent beyond into Wadi Marrakh almost dangerous; but the view
from the crest compensated us. Wadi Marrakh, a broad, peaceful avenue,
ran between two regular straight walls of hills to a circus four miles
off where valleys from left, right and front seemed to meet. Artificial
heaps of uncut stone were piled about the approach. As we entered it, we
saw that the grey hill-walls swept back on each side in a half-circle.
Before us, to the south, the curve was barred across by a straight wall
or step of blue-black lava, standing over a little grove of thorn trees.
We made for these and lay down in their thin shade, grateful in such
sultry air for any pretence of coolness.</p>
<p>The day, now at its zenith, was very hot; and my weakness had so
increased that my head hardly held up against it. The puffs of feverish
wind pressed like scorching hands against our faces, burning our eyes.
My pain made me breathe in gasps through the mouth; the wind cracked my
lips and seared my throat till I was too dry to talk, and drinking
became sore; yet I always needed to drink, as my thirst would not let me
lie still and get the peace I longed for. The flies were a plague.</p>
<p>The bed of the valley was of fine quartz gravel and white sand. Its
glitter thrust itself between our eyelids; and the level of the ground
seemed to dance as the wind moved the white tips of stubble grass to and
fro. The camels loved this grass, which grew in tufts, about sixteen
inches high, on slate-green stalks. They gulped down great quantities of
it until the men drove them in and couched them by me. At the moment I
hated the beasts, for too much food made their breath stink; and they
rumblingly belched up a new mouthful from their stomachs each time they
had chewed and swallowed the last, till a green slaver flooded out
between their loose lips over the side teeth, and dripped down their
sagging chins.</p>
<p>Lying angrily there, I threw a stone at the nearest, which got up and
wavered about behind my head: finally it straddled its back legs and
staled in wide, bitter jets; and I was so far gone with the heat and
weakness and pain that I just lay there and cried about it unhelping.
The men had gone to make a fire and cook a gazelle one of them had
fortunately shot; and I realized that on another day this halt would
have been pleasant to me; for the hills were very strange and their
colours vivid. The base had the warm grey of old stored sunlight; while
about their crests ran narrow veins of granite-coloured stone, generally
in pairs, following the contour of the skyline like the rusted metals of
an abandoned scenic railway. Arslan said the hills were combed like
cocks, a sharper observation.</p>
<p>After the men had fed we re-mounted, and easily climbed the first
wave of the lava flood. It was short, as was the second, on the top of
which lay a broad terrace with an alluvial plot of sand and gravel in
its midst. The lava was a nearly clean floor of iron-red rock-cinders,
over which were scattered fields of loose stone. The third and other
steps ascended to the south of us: but we turned east, up Wadi Gara.</p>
<p>Gara had, perhaps, been a granite valley down whose middle the lava
had flowed, slowly filling it, and arching itself up in a central heap.
On each side were deep troughs, between the lava and the hill-side. Rain
water flooded these as often as storms burst in the hills. The lava
flow, as it coagulated, had been twisted like a rope, cracked, and bent
back irregularly upon itself. The surface was loose with fragments
through which many generations of camel parties had worn an inadequate
and painful track.</p>
<p>We struggled along for hours, going slowly, our camels wincing at
every stride as the sharp edges slipped beneath their tender feet. The
paths were only to be seen by the droppings along them, and by the
slightly bluer surfaces of the rubbed stones. The Arabs declared them
impassable after dark, which was to be believed, for we risked laming
our beasts each time our impatience made us urge them on. Just before
five in the afternoon, however, the way got easier. We seemed to be near
the head of the valley, which grew narrow. Before us on the right, an
exact cone-crater, with tidy furrows scoring it from lip to foot,
promised good going; for it was made of black ash, clean as though
sifted, with here and there a bank of harder soil, and cinders. Beyond
it was another lava-field, older perhaps than the valleys, for its
stones were smoothed, and between them were straths of flat earth, rank
with weeds. In among these open spaces were Beduin tents, whose owners
ran to us when they saw us coming; and, taking our head-stalls with
hospitable force, led us in.</p>
<p>They proved to be Sheikh Fahad el Hansha and his men: old and
garrulous warriors who had marched with us to Wejh, and had been with
Garland on that great occasion when his first automatic mine had
succeeded under a troop train near Toweira station. Fahad would not hear
of my resting quietly outside his tent, but with the reckless equality
of the desert men urged me into an unfortunate place inside among his
own vermin. There he plied me with bowl after bowl of diuretic
camel-milk between questions about Europe, my home tribe, the English
camel-pasturages, the war in the Hejaz and the wars elsewhere, Egypt and
Damascus, how Feisal was, why did we seek Abdulla, and by what
perversity did I remain Christian, when their hearts and hands waited to
welcome me to the Faith?</p>
<p>So passed long hours till ten at night, when the guest-sheep was
carried in, dismembered royally over a huge pile of buttered rice. I ate
as manners demanded, twisted myself up in my cloak, and slept; my bodily
exhaustion, after those hours of the worst imaginable marching, proofing
me against the onslaught of lice and fleas. The illness, however, had
stimulated my ordinarily sluggish fancy, which ran riot this night in
dreams of wandering naked for a dark eternity over interminable lava
(like scrambled egg gone iron-blue, and very wrong), sharp as
insect-bites underfoot; and with some horror, perhaps a dead Moor,
always climbing after us.</p>
<p>In the morning we woke early and refreshed, with our clothes
stinging-full of fiery points feeding on us. After one more bowl of milk
proffered us by the eager Fahad, I was able to walk unaided to my camel
and mount her actively. We rode up the last piece of Wadi Gara to the
crest, among cones of black cinders from a crater to the south. Thence
we turned to a branch valley, ending in a steep and rocky chimney, up
which we pulled our camels.</p>
<p>Beyond we had an easy descent into Wadi Murrmiya, whose middle
bristled with lava like galvanized iron, on each side of which there
were smooth sandy beds, good going. After a while we came to a fault in
the flow, which served as a track to the other side. By it we crossed
over, finding the lava pocketed with soils apparently of extreme
richness, for in them were leafy trees and lawns of real grass, starred
with flowers, the best grazing of all our ride, looking the more
wonderfully green because of the blue-black twisted crusts of rock
about. The lava had changed its character. Here were no piles of loose
stones, as big as a skull or a man’s hand, rubbed and rounded together;
but bunched and crystallized fronds of metallic rock, altogether
impassable for bare feet.</p>
<p>Another watershed conducted us to an open place where the Jeheina had
ploughed some eight acres of the thin soil below a thicket of scrub.
They said there were like it in the neighbourhood other fields, silent
witnesses to the courage and persistence of the Arabs. It was called
Wadi Chetf, and after it was another broken river of lava, the worst yet
encountered. A shadowy path zigzagged across it. We lost one camel with
a broken fore-leg, the result of a stumble in a pot-hole; and the many
bones which lay about showed that we were not the only party to suffer
misfortune in the passage. However, this ended our lava, according to
the guides, and we went thence forward along easy valleys with finally a
long run up a gentle slope till dusk. The going was so good and the cool
of the day so freshened me that we did not halt at nightfall, after our
habit, but pushed on for an hour across the basin of Murrmiya into the
basin of Wadi Ais, and there, by Tleih, we stopped for our last camp in
the open.</p>
<p>I rejoiced that we were so nearly in, for fever was heavy on me. I
was afraid that perhaps I was going to be really ill, and the prospect
of falling into the well-meaning hands of tribesmen in such a state was
not pleasant. Their treatment of every sickness was to burn holes in the
patient’s body at some spot believed to be the complement of the part
affected. It was a cure tolerable to such as had faith in it, but
torture to the unbelieving: to incur it unwillingly would be silly, and
yet certain; for the Arabs’ good intentions, selfish as their good
digestions, would never heed a sick man’s protesting.</p>
<p>The morning was easy, over open valleys and gentle rides into Wadi
Ais. We arrived at Abu Markha, its nearest watering-place, just a few
minutes after Sherif Abdulla had dismounted there, and while he was
ordering his tents to be pitched in an acacia glade beyond the well. He
was leaving his old camp at Bir el Amri, lower down the valley, as he
had left Murabba, his camp before, because the ground had been fouled by
the careless multitude of his men and animals. I gave him the documents
from Feisal, explaining the situation in Medina, and the need we had of
haste to block the railway. I thought he took it coolly; but, without
argument, went on to say that I was a little tired after my journey, and
with his permission would lie down and sleep a while. He pitched me a
tent next his great marquee, and I went into it and rested myself at
last. It had been a struggle against faintness day-long in the saddle to
get here at all: and now the strain was ended with the delivery of my
message, I felt that another hour would have brought the breaking
point.</p>
