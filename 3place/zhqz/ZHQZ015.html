<h4 id="chapter-iv">CHAPTER IV</h4>
<p>THE first great rush round the Mediterranean had shown the world the
power of an excited Arab for a short spell of intense physical activity;
but when the effort burned out the lack of endurance and routine in the
Semitic mind became as evident. The provinces they had overrun they
neglected, out of sheer distaste of system, and had to seek the help of
their conquered subjects, or of more vigorous foreigners, to administer
their ill-knit and inchoate empires. So, early in the Middle Ages, the
Turks found a footing in the Arab States, first as servants, then as
helpers, and then as a parasite growth which choked the life out of the
old body politic. The last phase was of enmity, when the Hulagus or
Timurs sated their blood lust, burning and destroying everything which
irked them with a pretension of superiority.</p>
<p>Arab civilizations had been of an abstract nature, moral and
intellectual rather than applied; and their lack of public spirit made
their excellent private qualities futile. They were fortunate in their
epoch: Europe had fallen barbarous; and the memory of Greek and Latin
learning was fading from men’s minds. By contrast the imitative exercise
of the Arabs seemed cultured, their mental activity progressive, their
state prosperous. They had performed real service in preserving
something of a classical past for a medieval future.</p>
<p>With the coming of the Turks this happiness became a dream. By stages
the Semites of Asia passed under their yoke, and found it a slow death.
Their goods were stripped from them; and their spirits shrivelled in the
numbing breath of a military Government. Turkish rule was gendarme rule,
and Turkish political theory as crude as its practice. The Turks taught
the Arabs that the interests of a sect were higher than those of
patriotism: that the petty concerns of the province were more than
nationality. They led them by subtle dissensions to distrust one
another. Even the Arabic language was banished from courts and offices,
from the Government service, and from superior schools. Arabs might only
serve the State by sacrifice of their racial characteristics. These
measures were not accepted quietly. Semitic tenacity showed itself in
the many rebellions of Syria, Mesopotamia and Arabia against the grosser
forms of Turkish penetration; and resistance was also made to the more
insidious attempts at absorption. The Arabs would not give up their rich
and flexible tongue for crude Turkish: instead, they filled Turkish with
Arabic words, and held to the treasures of their own literature.</p>
<p>They lost their geographical sense, and their racial and political
and historical memories; but they clung the more tightly to their
language, and erected it almost into a fatherland of its own. The first
duty of every Moslem was to study the Koran, the sacred book of Islam,
and incidentally the greatest Arab literary monument. The knowledge that
this religion was his own, and that only he was perfectly qualified to
understand and practise it, gave every Arab a standard by which to judge
the banal achievements of the Turk.</p>
<p>Then came the Turkish revolution, the fall of Abdul Hamid, and the
supremacy of the Young Turks. The horizon momentarily broadened for the
Arabs. The Young-Turk movement was a revolt against the hierarchic
conception of Islam and the pan-Islamic theories of the old Sultan, who
had aspired, by making himself spiritual director of the Moslem world,
to be also (beyond appeal) its director in temporal affairs. These young
politicians rebelled and threw him into prison, under the impulse of
constitutional theories of a sovereign state. So, at a time when Western
Europe was just beginning to climb out of nationality into
internationality, and to rumble with wars far removed from problems of
race, Western Asia began to climb out of catholicism into nationalist
politics, and to dream of wars for self-government and self-sovereignty,
instead of for faith or dogma. This tendency had broken out first and
most strongly in the Near East, in the little Balkan States, and had
sustained them through an almost unparalleled martyrdom to their goal of
separation from Turkey. Later there had been nationalist movements in
Egypt, in India, in Persia, and finally in Constantinople, where they
were fortified and made pointed by the new American ideas in education:
ideas which, when released in the old high Oriental atmosphere, made an
explosive mixture. The American schools, teaching by the method of
inquiry, encouraged scientific detachment and free exchange of views.
Quite without intention they taught revolution, since it was impossible
for an individual to be modern in Turkey and at the same time loyal, if
he had been born of one of the subject races — Greeks, Arabs, Kurds,
Armenians or Albanians — over whom the Turks were so long helped to keep
dominion.</p>
<p>The Young Turks, in the confidence of their first success, were
carried away by the logic of their principles, and as protest against
Pan-Islam preached Ottoman brotherhood. The gullible subject races — far
more numerous than the Turks themselves — believed that they were called
upon to co-operate in building a new East. Rushing to the task (full of
Herbert Spencer and Alexander Hamilton) they laid down platforms of
sweeping ideas, and hailed the Turks as partners. The Turks, terrified
at the forces they had let loose, drew the fires as suddenly as they had
stoked them. Turkey made Turkish for the Turks — Yeni-Turan — became the
cry. Later on, this policy would turn them towards the rescue of their
irredenti — the Turkish populations subject to Russia in Central Asia;
but, first of all, they must purge their Empire of such irritating
subject races as resisted the ruling stamp. The Arabs, the largest alien
component of Turkey, must first be dealt with. Accordingly the Arab
deputies were scattered, the Arab societies forbidden, the Arab notables
proscribed. Arabic manifestations and the Arabic language were
suppressed by Enver Pasha more sternly than by Abdul Hamid before
him.</p>
<p>However, the Arabs had tasted freedom: they could not change their
ideas as quickly as their conduct; and the stiffer spirits among them
were not easily to be put down. They read the Turkish papers, putting
‘Arab’ for ‘Turk’ in the patriotic exhortations. Suppression charged
them with unhealthy violence. Deprived of constitutional outlets they
became revolutionary. The Arab societies went underground, and changed
from liberal clubs into conspiracies. The Akhua, the Arab mother
society, was publicly dissolved. It was replaced in Mesopotamia by the
dangerous Ahad, a very secret brotherhood, limited almost entirely to
Arab officers in the Turkish Army, who swore to acquire the military
knowledge of their masters, and to turn it against them, in the service
of the Arab people, when the moment of rebellion came.</p>
<p>It was a large society, with a sure base in the wild part of Southern
Irak, where Sayid Taleb, the young John Wilkes of the Arab movement,
held the power in his unprincipled fingers. To it belonged seven out of
every ten Mesopotamian-born officers; and their counsel was so well kept
that members of it held high command in Turkey to the last. When the
crash came, and Allenby rode across Armageddon and Turkey fell, one
vice-president of the society was commanding the broken fragments of the
Palestine armies on the retreat, and another was directing the Turkish
forces across-Jordan in the Amman area. Yet later, after the armistice,
great places in the Turkish service were still held by men ready to turn
on their masters at a word from their Arab leaders. To most of them the
word was never given; for those societies were pro-Arab only, willing to
fight for nothing but Arab independence; and they could see no advantage
in supporting the Allies rather than the Turks, since they did not
believe our assurances that we would leave them free. Indeed, many of
them preferred an Arabia united by Turkey in miserable subjection, to an
Arabia divided up and slothful under the easier control of several
European powers in spheres of influence.</p>
<p>Greater than the Ahad was the Fetah, the society of freedom in Syria.
The landowners, the writers, the doctors, the great public servants
linked themselves in this society with a common oath, passwords, signs,
a press and a central treasury, to ruin the Turkish Empire. With the
noisy facility of the Syrian — an ape-like people having much of the
Japanese quickness, but shallow — they speedily built up a formidable
organization. They looked outside for help, and expected freedom to come
by entreaty, not by sacrifice. They corresponded with Egypt, with the
Ahad (whose members, with true Mesopotamian dourness, rather despised
them), with the Sherif of Mecca, and with Great Britain: everywhere
seeking the ally to serve their turn. They also were deadly secret; and
the Government, though it suspected their existence, could find no
credible evidence of their leaders or membership. It had to hold its
hand until it could strike with evidence enough to satisfy the English
and French diplomats who acted as modern public opinion in Turkey. The
war in 1914 withdrew these agents, and left the Turkish Government free
to strike.</p>
<p>Mobilization put all power into the hands of those members — Enver,
Talaat and Jemal — who were at once the most ruthless, the most logical,
and the most ambitious of the Young Turks. They set themselves to stamp
out all non-Turkish currents in the State, especially Arab and Armenian
nationalism. For the first step they found a specious and convenient
weapon in the secret papers of a French Consul in Syria, who left behind
him in his Consulate copies of correspondence (about Arab freedom) which
had passed between him and an Arab club, not connected with the Fetah
but made up of the more talkative and less formidable intelligenzia of
the Syrian coast. The Turks, of course, were delighted; for ‘colonial’
aggression in North Africa had given the French a black reputation in
the Arabic-speaking Moslem world; and it served Jemal well to show his
co-religionists that these Arab nationalists were infidel enough to
prefer France to Turkey.</p>
<p>In Syria, of course, his disclosures had little novelty; but the
members of the society were known and respected, if somewhat academic,
persons; and their arrest and condemnation, and the crop of
deportations, exiles, and executions to which their trial led, moved the
country to its depths, and taught the Arabs of the Fetah that if they
did not profit by their lesson the fate of the Armenians would be upon
them. The Armenians had been well armed and organized; but their leaders
had failed them. They had been disarmed and destroyed piecemeal, the men
by massacre, the women and children by being driven and overdriven along
the wintry roads into the desert, naked and hungry, the common prey of
any passer-by, until death took them. The Young Turks had killed the
Armenians, not because they were Christians, but because they were
Armenians; and for the same reason they herded Arab Moslems and Arab
Christians into the same prison, and hanged them together on the same
scaffold. Jemal Pasha united all classes, conditions and creeds in
Syria, under pressure of a common misery and peril, and so made a
concerted revolt possible.</p>
<p>The Turks suspected the Arab officers and soldiers in the Army, and
hoped to use against them the scattering tactics which had served
against the Armenians. At first transport difficulties stood in their
way; and there came a dangerous concentration of Arab divisions (nearly
one third of the original Turkish Army was Arabic speaking) in North
Syria early in 1915. They broke these up when possible, marching them
off to Europe, to the Dardanelles, to the Caucasus, or the Canal —
anywhere, so long as they were put quickly into the firing-line, or
withdrawn far from the sight and help of their compatriots. A Holy War
was proclaimed to give the ‘Union and Progress’ banner something of the
traditional sanctity of the Caliph’s battle-order in the eyes of the old
clerical elements; and the Sherif of Mecca was invited — or rather
ordered — to echo the cry.</p>
