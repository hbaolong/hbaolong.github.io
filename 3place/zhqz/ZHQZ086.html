<h4 id="chapter-lxxv">CHAPTER LXXV</h4>
<p>EXHAUSTED, we lay down a moment, but were astir again very early to
review the camel-men of the Sirhan. They made a wild and ragged show,
dashing past, but we thought them loose riders, and they blustered too
much to be quite convincing. It was a pity they had no real leader.
Mteir was too old for service, and ibn Bani was an indistinct man,
ambitious rather as a politician than as a fighter. However, they were
the force we had, so there was an end to it, and at three in the
afternoon we mounted for Azrak, since another night in the tent would
have left us picked to dry bones. Abd el Kader and his servants mounted
their mares, as sign that the fighting line was near. They rode just
behind us.</p>
<p>It was to be Ali’s first view of Azrak, and we hurried up the stony
ridge in high excitement, talking of the wars and songs and passions of
the early shepherd kings, with names like music, who had loved this
place; and of the Roman legionaries who languished here as garrison in
yet earlier times. Then the blue fort on its rock above the rustling
palms, with the fresh meadows and shining springs of water, broke on our
sight. Of Azrak, as of Rumm, one said ‘Numen inest’. Both were magically
haunted: but whereas Rumm was vast and echoing and Godlike, Azrak’s
unfathomable silence was steeped in knowledge of wandering poets,
champions, lost kingdoms, all the crime and chivalry and dead
magnificence of Hira and Ghassan. Each stone or blade of it was radiant
with half-memory of the luminous silky Eden, which had passed so long
ago.</p>
<p>At last Ali shook his rein, and his camel picked her careful way down
the lava flow to the rich turf behind the springs. Our puckered eyes
opened wide with relief that the bitterness of many weeks was gone out
of the reflected sunlight. Ali screamed ‘Grass’, and flung himself off
the saddle to the ground on hands and feet, his face bowed down among
the harsh stems which seemed so kindly in the desert. He leaped up,
flushed, with his Harith war-cry, tore his head-cloth off, and raced
along the marsh, bounding over the red channels where water clotted
among the reeds. His white feet flashed beneath the tossed folds of his
cashmere robes. We in the West seldom experienced that added beauty when
the body was seen lightly poised on bare feet; when the rhythm and grace
of movement became visible, with the play of muscle and sinew pointing
the mechanism of each stride and the balance of repose.</p>
<p>When we turned again to business there was no Abd el Kader. We looked
for him in the castle, in the palm-garden, over by the spring.
Eventually we sent our men away to search, and they came back with
Arabs, who told us that from just after the start he had ridden off
northward through the flaky hillocks, towards Jebel Druse. The rank and
file did not know our plans, hated him, and had been glad to see him go:
but it was bad news for us.</p>
<p>Of our three alternatives, Um Keis had been abandoned: without Abd el
Kader, Wadi Khalid was impossible: this meant that we must necessarily
attempt the bridge at Tell el Shehab. To reach it we had to cross the
open land between Remthe and Deraa. Abd el Kader was gone up to the
enemy, with information of our plans and strength. The Turks, if they
took the most reasonable precautions, would trap us at the bridge. We
took council with Fahad and decided to push on none the less, trusting
to the usual incompetence of our enemy. It was not a confident decision.
While we took it the sunshine seemed less lambent, and Azrak not so
aloof from fear.</p>
<p>Next morning we wound pensively along a flinty valley and over a
ridge into Wadi el Harith, whose green course had a sickening likeness
to some lands at home. Ali rejoiced to see a rich pasture-valley bearing
his family name, and was as glad as our camels when we found limpid
pools of last week’s rain-water in hollows among the bushes. We stopped
and used the discovery for lunch, making a long halt. Adhub went off
with Ahmed and Awad to look for gazelle. He came back with three. So we
stopped yet longer and made a second lunch, like a feast, of meat
gobbets roasted on ramrods till the outside was black as coal, while the
heart remained juicily sweet. Sojourners in the desert loved its
accidental bounty; also on this trip a reluctance weighed down our daily
marching, to make us glad of each delay.</p>
<p>Unhappily my rest time was spoiled by a bed of justice. The feud
between Ahmed and Awad broke out during this gazelle chase into a duel.
Awad shot off Ahmed’s head-rope; Ahmed holed Awad’s cloak. I disarmed
them and gave loud order that the right thumb and forefinger of each be
cut off. The terror of this drove them into an instant, violent and
public kissing of peace. A little later all my men went capital bail
that the trouble had ended. I referred the case to Ali ibn el Hussein,
who set them at liberty on probation, after sealing their promise with
the ancient and curious nomad penance of striking the head sharply with
the edge of a weighty dagger again and again till the issuing blood had
run down to the waist belt. It caused painful but not dangerous scalp
wounds, whose ache at first and whose scars later were supposed to
remind the would-be defaulter of the bond he had given.</p>
<p>We pushed on again for miles over perfect going, through rich country
for the camels, till at Abu Sawana we found a flinty hollow, brim-full
of deliciously clear rain-water in a narrow channel two feet deep, and
perhaps ten feet wide, but half a mile long. This would serve as
starting point for our bridge-raid. To be sure of its safety, we rode a
few yards further, to the top of a stony knoll; and there found
ourselves looking down upon a retreating party of Circassian horsemen,
sent out by the Turks to report if the waters were occupied. They had
missed us, to our mutual benefit, by five minutes.</p>
<p>Next morning we filled our water-skins, since we should find nothing
to drink between here and the bridge; and then marched leisurely until
the desert ended in a three-foot depression at the edge of a clean
plain, which extended flatly to the metals of the railway some miles
off. We halted for dusk to make its crossing possible. Our plan was to
slip over secretly, and hide in the further foothills, below Deraa. In
the spring these hills were full of grazing sheep, for the rain cloaked
their low sides in new grass and flowers. With the coming of summer they
dried, and became deserted save for chance travellers on obscure
errands. We might fairly calculate on lying in their folds for a day
undisturbed.</p>
<p>We made our halt another opportunity of food, for we were recklessly
eating all we could as often as we had the chance. It lightened our
stores, and kept us from thinking: but even with this help the day was
very long. At last sunset came. The plain shivered once, as the
darkness, which for an hour had been gathering among the facing hills,
flowed slowly out and drowned it. We mounted. Two hours later after a
quick march over gravel, Fahad and myself, out scouting ahead, came to
the railway; and without difficulty found a stony place where our
caravan would make no signs of passage. The Turkish rail-guards were
clearly at their ease, which meant that Abd el Kader had not yet caused
a panic by what news he brought.</p>
<p>We rode the other side of the line for half an hour, and then dipped
into a very slight rocky depression full of succulent plants. This was
Ghadir el Abyadh, recommended by Mifleh as our ambush. We took his
surprising word that we were in cover, and lay down among or alongside
our loaded beasts for a short sleep. Dawn would show us how far we were
safe and hidden.</p>
<p>As day was breaking, Fahad led me to the edge of our pit, some
fifteen feet above, and from it we looked straight across a
slowly-dropping meadow to the railway, which seemed nearly within shot.
It was most inconveniently close, but the Sukhur knew no better place.
We had to stand-to all the day. Each time something was reported, our
men ran to look at it, and the low bank would grow a serried frieze of
human heads. Also, the grazing camels required many guards to keep them
from straying into view. Whenever a patrol passed we had to be very
gentle in controlling the beasts, since if one of them had roared or
ruckled it would have drawn the enemy. Yesterday had been long: to-day
was longer: we could not feed, as our water had to be husbanded with
jealous care against the scarcity of to-morrow. The very knowledge made
us thirsty.</p>
<p>Ali and I worked at the last arrangements for our ride. We were
penned here until sunset; and must reach Tell el Shehab, blow up the
bridge, and get back east of the railway by dawn. This meant a ride of
at least eighty miles in the thirteen hours of darkness, with an
elaborate demolition thrown in. Such a performance was beyond the
capacity of most of the Indians. They were not good riders, and had
broken up their camels in the march from Akaba. An Arab by saving his
beast, could bring it home in fair condition after hard work. The
Indians had done their best; but the discipline of their cavalry
training had tired out them and the animals in our easy stages.</p>
<p>So we picked out the six best riders and put them on the six best
camels, with Hassan Shab, their officer and greatest-hearted man, to
lead them. He decided that this little party would be fittest armed with
just one Vickers gun. It was a very serious reduction of our offensive
power. The more I looked at it, the less fortunate seemed the
development of this Yarmuk plan of ours.</p>
<p>The Beni Sakhr were fighting men; but we distrusted the Serahin. So
Ali and I decided to make the Beni Sakhr, under Fahad, our storming
party. We would leave some Serahin to guard the camels while the others
carried the blasting gelatine in our dismounted charge upon the bridge.
To suit the hurried carriage down steep hill-sides in the dark we
changed the explosive loads into thirty-pound lumps, which were put, for
visibility, each lump into its own white bag. Wood undertook to repack
the gelatine, and shared the rare headache all got from handling it.
This helped pass the time.</p>
<p>My bodyguard had to be carefully distributed. One good rider was told
off to each of the less expert local men, whose virtue was that they
knew the country: the pairs so made were attached to one or other of my
foreign liabilities, with instructions to keep close to him all night.
Ali ibn el Hussein took six of his servants, and the party was completed
by twenty Beni Sakhr and forty Serahin. We left the lame and weak camels
behind at Abyadh in charge of the balance of our men, with instructions
to get back to Abu Sawana before dawn to-morrow and wait there for our
news. Two of my men developed sudden illnesses, which made them feel
unable to ride with us. I excused them for the night, and afterward from
all duties whatsoever.</p>
