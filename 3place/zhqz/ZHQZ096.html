<h4 id="chapter-lxxxv">CHAPTER LXXXV</h4>
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING, these plans quickly went adrift. Before they had
been agreed upon we were astonished by a sudden try of the Turks to
dislodge us. We had never dreamed of this, for it seemed out of the
question that they should hope to keep Tafileh, or want to keep it.
Allenby was just in Jerusalem, and for the Turks the issue of the war
might depend on their successful defence of the Jordan against him.
Unless Jericho fell, or until it fell, Tafileh was an obscure village of
no interest. Nor did we value it as a possession; our desire was to get
past it towards the enemy. For men so critically placed as the Turks to
waste one single casualty on its recapture appeared the rankest
folly.</p>
<p>Hamid Fakhri Pasha, commanding the 48th Division and the Amman
sector, thought otherwise, or had his orders. He collected about nine
hundred infantry, made up of three battalions (in January 1918 a Turkish
battalion was a poor thing) with a hundred cavalry, two mountain
howitzers, and twenty-seven machine-guns, and sent them by rail and road
to Kerak. There he impressed all the local transport, drew a complete
set of civil officials to staff his new administration in Tafileh, and
marched southward to surprise us.</p>
<p>Surprise us he did. We first heard of him when his cavalry feelers
fell on our pickets in Wadi Hesa, the gorge of great width and depth and
difficulty which cut off Kerak from Tafileh, Moab from Edom. By dusk he
had driven them back, and was upon us.</p>
<p>Jaafar Pasha had sketched a defence position on the south bank of the
great ravine of Tafileh; proposing, if the Turks attacked, to give them
the village, and defend the heights which overhung it, behind. This
seemed to me doubly unsound. The slopes were dead, and their defence as
difficult as their attack. They could be turned from the east; and by
quitting the village we threw away the local people, whose votes and
hands would be for the occupiers of their houses.</p>
<p>However, it was the ruling idea — all Zeid had — and so about
midnight he gave the order, and servants and retainers loaded up their
stuff. The men-at-arms proceeded to the southern crest, while the
baggage train was sent off by the lower road to safety. This move
created panic in the town. The peasants thought we were running away (I
think we were) and rushed to save their goods and lives. It was freezing
hard, and the ground was crusted with noisy ice. In the blustering dark
the confusion and crying through the narrow streets were terrible.</p>
<p>Dhiab the Sheikh had told us harrowing tales of the disaffection of
the townspeople, to increase the splendour of his own loyalty; but my
impression was that they were stout fellows of great potential use. To
prove it I sat out on my roof, or walked in the dark up and down the
steep alleys, cloaked against recognition, with my guards unobtrusively
about me within call. So we heard what passed. The people were in a very
passion of fear, nearly dangerous, abusing everybody and everything: but
there was nothing pro-Turkish abroad. They were in horror of the Turks
returning, ready to do all in their physical capacity to support against
them a leader with fighting intention. This was satisfactory, for it
chimed with my hankering to stand where we were and fight stiffly.</p>
<p>Finally, I met the young Jazi sheikhs Metaab and Annad, beautiful in
silks and gleaming silver arms, and sent them to find their uncle, Hamd
el Arar. Him I asked to ride away north of the ravine, to tell the
peasantry, who, by the noise, were still fighting the Turks, that we
were on our way up to help them. Hamd, a melancholy, courtly, gallant
cavalier, galloped off at once with twenty of his relations, all that he
could gather in the distracted moment.</p>
<p>Their passage at speed through the streets added the last touch
required to perfect the terror. The housewives bundled their goods
pell-mell out of doors and windows, though no men were waiting to
receive them. Children were trampled on, and yelled, while their mothers
were yelling anyhow. The Motalga during their gallop fired shot after
shot into the air to encourage themselves, and, as though to answer
them, the flashes of the enemy rifles became visible, outlining the
northern cliffs in that last blackness of sky before the dawn. I walked
up the opposite heights to consult with Sherif Zeid.</p>
<p>Zeid sat gravely on a rock, sweeping the country with field-glasses
for the enemy. As crises deepened, Zeid drew detached, nonchalant. I was
in a furious rage. The Turks should never, by the rules of sane
generalship, have ventured back to Tafileh at all. It was simple greed,
a dog-in-the-manger attitude unworthy of a serious enemy, just the sort
of hopeless thing a Turk would do. How could they expect a proper war
when they gave us no chance to honour them? Our morale was continually
being ruined by their follies, for neither could our men respect their
courage, nor our officers respect their brains. Also, it was an icy
morning, and I had been up all night and was Teutonic enough to decide
that they should pay for my changed mind and plan.</p>
<p>They must be few in number, judging by their speed of advance. We had
every advantage, of time, of terrain, of number, of weather, and could
checkmate them easily: but to my wrath that was not enough. We would
play their kind of game on our pigmy scale; deliver them a pitched
battle such as they wanted; kill them all. I would rake up my memory of
the half-forgotten maxims of the orthodox army text-book, and parody
them in action.</p>
<p>This was villainous, for with arithmetic and geography for allies we
might have spared the suffering factor of humanity; and to make a
conscious joke of victory was wanton. We could have won by refusing
battle, foxed them by manœuvring our centre as on twenty such occasions
before and since; yet bad temper and conceit united for this time to
make me not content to know my power, but determined to give public
advertisement of it to the enemy and to everyone. Zeid, now convinced of
the inconvenience of the defence-line, was very ready to listen to the
voice of the tempter.</p>
<p>First I suggested that Abdulla go forward with two Hotchkiss guns to
test the strength and disposition of the enemy. Then we talked of what
next; very usefully, for Zeid was a cool and gallant little fighter,
with the temperament of a professional officer. We saw Abdulla climb the
other bank. The shooting became intense for a time, and then faded into
distance. His coming had stimulated the Motalga horsemen and the
villagers, who fell on the Turkish cavalry and drove them over a first
ridge, across a plain two miles wide, and over a ridge beyond it down
the first step of the great Hesa depression.</p>
<p>Behind this lay the Turkish main body, just getting on the road again
after a severe night which had stiffened them in their places. They came
properly into action, and Abdulla was checked at once. We heard the
distant rolling of machine-gun fire, growing up in huge bursts, laced by
a desultory shelling. Our ears told us what was happening as well as if
we saw it, and the news was excellent. I wanted Zeid to come forward at
once on that authority: but his caution stepped in and he insisted that
we wait exact word from his advance-guard, Abdulla.</p>
<p>This was not necessary, according to book, but they knew I was a sham
soldier, and took licence to hesitate over my advice when it came
peremptorily. However, I held a hand worth two of that and went off
myself for the front to prejudice their decision. On the way I saw my
bodyguard, turning over the goods exposed for removal in the streets,
and finding much of interest to themselves. I told them to recover our
camels and to bring their Hotchkiss automatic to the north bank of the
gorge in a hurry,</p>
<p>The road dipped into a grove of fig-trees, knots of blue snaky
boughs; bare, as they would be long after the rest of nature was grown
green. Thence it turned eastward, to wind lengthily in the valley to the
crest. I left it, climbing straight up the cliffs. An advantage of going
barefoot was a new and incredible sureness upon rock when the soles had
got hard by painful insistence, or were too chilled to feel jags and
scrapes. The new way, while warming me, also shortened my time
appreciably, and very soon, at the top, I found a level bit, and then a
last ridge overlooking the plateau.</p>
<p>This last straight bank, with Byzantine foundations in it, seemed
very proper for a reserve or ultimate line of defence for Tafileh. To be
sure, we had no reserve as yet — no one had the least notion who or what
we would have anywhere — but, if we did have anybody, here was their
place: and at that precise moment Zeid’s personal Ageyl became visible,
hiding coyly in a hollow. To make them move required words of a strength
to unravel their plaited hair: but at last I had them sitting along the
skyline of Reserve Ridge. They were about twenty, and from a distance
looked beautiful, like ‘points’ of a considerable army. I gave them my
signet as a token, with orders to collect there all newcomers,
especially my fellows with their gun.</p>
<p>As I walked northward towards the fighting, Abdulla met me, on his
way to Zeid with news. He had finished his ammunition, lost five men
from shell-fire, and had one automatic gun destroyed. Two guns, he
thought the Turks had. His idea was to get up Zeid with all his men and
fight: so nothing remained for me to add to his message; and there was
no subtlety in leaving alone my happy masters to cross and dot their own
right decision.</p>
<p>He gave me leisure in which to study the coming battlefield. The tiny
plain was about two miles across, bounded by low green ridges, and
roughly triangular, with my reserve ridge as base. Through it ran the
road to Kerak, dipping into the Hesa valley. The Turks were fighting
their way up this road. Abdulla’s charge had taken the western or
left-hand ridge, which was now our firing-line.</p>
<p>Shells were falling in the plain as I walked across it, with harsh
stalks of wormwood stabbing into my wounded feet. The enemy fusing was
too long, so that the shells grazed the ridge and burst away behind. One
fell near me, and I learned its calibre from the hot cap. As I went they
began to shorten range, and by the time I got to the ridge it was being
freely sprinkled with shrapnel. Obviously the Turks had got observation
somehow, and looking round I saw them climbing along the eastern side
beyond the gap of the Kerak road. They would soon outflank us at our end
of the western ridge.</p>
