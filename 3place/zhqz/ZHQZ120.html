<h4 id="chapter-ci">CHAPTER CI</h4>
<p>XDULY, before dawn, we drove upon the track of Stirling’s cars, eager
to be with them before their fight. Unfortunately the going was not
helpful. At first we had a bad descent, and then difficult flats of
jagged dolerite, across which we crawled painfully. Later we ran over
ploughed slopes. The soil was heavy for the cars, for with summer
drought this red earth cracked a yard deep and two or three inches wide.
The five-ton armoured cars were reduced to first speed, and nearly
stuck.</p>
<p>We overtook the Arab Army about eight in the morning, on the crest of
the slope to the railway, as it was deploying to attack the little
bridge-guarding redoubt between us and the mount of Tell Arar whose head
overlooked the country-side to Deraa.</p>
<p>Rualla horsemen, led by Trad, dashed down the long slope and over the
liquorice-grown bed of the watercourse to the line. Young bounced after
them in his Ford. From the ridge we thought the railway taken without a
shot, but while we gazed, suddenly from the neglected Turkish post came
a vicious spitting fire, and our braves, who had been standing in
splendid attitudes on the coveted line (wondering privately what on
earth to do next) disappeared.</p>
<p>Nuri Said moved down Pisani’s guns and fired a few shots. Then the
Rualla and troops rushed the redoubt easily, with only one killed. So
the southern ten miles of the Damascus line was freely ours by nine in
the morning. It was the only railway to Palestine and Hejaz and I could
hardly realize our fortune; hardly believe that our word to Allenby was
fulfilled so simply and so soon.</p>
<p>The Arabs streamed down from the ridge in rivers of men, and swarmed
upon the round head of Tell Arar, to look over their plain, whose rimmed
flatness the early sun speciously relieved, by yet throwing more shadow
than light. Our soldiers could see Deraa, Mezerib and Ghazale, the three
key-stations, with their naked eyes.</p>
<p>I was seeing further than this: northward to Damascus, the Turkish
base, their only link with Constantinople and Germany, now cut off:
southward to Amman and Maan and Medina, all cut off: westward to Liman
von Sandars isolated in Nazareth: to Nablus: to the Jordan Valley.
To-day was September the seventeenth, the promised day, forty-eight
hours before Allenby would throw forward his full power. In forty-eight
hours the Turks might decide to change their dispositions to meet our
new danger; but they could not change them before Allenby struck.
Bartholomew had said, ‘Tell me if he will be in his Auja line the day
before we start, and I will tell you if we will win’. Well, he was; so
we would win. The question was by how much.</p>
<p>I wanted the whole line destroyed in a moment: but things seemed to
have stopped. The army had done its share: Nuri Said was posting
machine-guns about the Arar mound to keep back any sortie from Deraa:
but why was there no demolition going on? I rushed down, to find Peake’s
Egyptians making breakfast. It was Drake’s game of bowls, and I fell
dumb with admiration.</p>
<p>However, in an hour they were mustered for their rhythmic demolition
by numbers; and already the French gunners, who also carried gun-cotton,
had descended with intention upon the near bridge. They were not very
good, but at the second try did it some hurt.</p>
<p>From the head of Tell Arar, before the mirage had begun to dance, we
examined Deraa carefully through my strong glass, wanting to see what
the Turks had in store for us this day. The first discovery was
disturbing. Their aerodrome was alive with gangs pulling machine after
machine into the open. I could count eight or nine lined up. Otherwise
things were as we expected. Some few infantry were doubling out into the
defence position, and their guns were being fired towards us: but we
were four miles off. Locomotives were getting up steam: but the trains
were unarmoured. Behind us, towards Damascus, the country lay still as a
map. From Mezerib on our right, there was no movement. We held the
initiative.</p>
<p>Our hope was to fire six hundred charges, tulip-fashion, putting out
of commission six kilometres of rail. Tulips had been invented by Peake
and myself for this occasion. Thirty ounces of gun-cotton were planted
beneath the centre of the central sleeper of each ten-metre section of
the track. The sleepers were steel, and their box-shape left an
air-chamber which the gas expansion filled, to blow the middle of the
sleeper upward. If the charge was properly laid, the metal did not snap,
but humped itself, bud-like, two feet in the air. The lift of it pulled
the rails three inches up: the drag of it pulled them six inches
together; and, as the chairs gripped the bottom flanges, warped them
inward seriously. The triple distortion put them beyond repair. Three or
five sleepers would be likewise ruined, and a trench driven across the
earthwork: all this with one charge, fired by a fuse, so short that the
first, blowing off while the third was being lighted, cast its debris
safely overhead.</p>
<p>Six hundred such charges would take the Turks a fair week to mend.
This would be a generous reading of Allenby’s ‘three men and a boy with
pistols’. I turned to go back to the troops, and at that moment two
things happened. Peake fired his first charge, like a poplar-tree of
black smoke, with a low following report; and the first Turkish machine
got up and came for us. Nuri Said and I fitted admirably under an
outcrop of rock, fissured into deep natural trenches, on the hill’s
southern face. There we waited coolly for the bomb: but it was only a
reconnaissance machine, a Pfalz, which studied us, and returned to Deraa
with its news.</p>
<p>Bad news it must have been, for three two-seaters, and four scouts
and an old yellow-bellied Albatros got up in quick succession, and
circled over us, dropping bombs, or diving at us with machine-gun fire.
Nuri put his Hotchkiss gunners in the rock cracks, and rattled back at
them. Pisani cocked up his four mountain guns, and let fly some
optimistic shrapnel. This disturbed the enemy, who circled off, and came
back much higher. Their aim became uncertain.</p>
<p>We scattered out the troops and camels, while the irregulars
scattered themselves. To open into the thinnest target was our only hope
of safety, as the plain had not overhead cover for a rabbit; and our
hearts misgave us when we saw what thousands of men we had, dotted out
below. It was strange to stand on the hill-top looking at these two
rolling square miles, liberally spread with men and animals, and
bursting out irregularly with lazy silent bulbs of smoke where bombs
dropped (seemingly quite apart from their thunder) or with sprays of
dust where machine-gun groups lashed down.</p>
<p>Things looked and sounded hot, but the Egyptians went on working as
methodically as they had eaten. Four parties dug in tulips, while Peake
and one of his officers lit each series as it was laid. The two slabs of
gun-cotton in a tulip-charge were not enough to make a showy explosion,
and the aeroplanes seemed not to see what was going on: at least they
did not wash them particularly with bombs; and as the demolition
proceeded, the party drew gradually out of the danger-area into the
quiet landscape to the north. We traced their progress by the
degradation of the telegraph. In virgin parts its poles stood trimly,
drilled by the taut wire: but behind Peake they leaned and tottered
anyhow, or fell.</p>
<p>Nuri Said, Joyce and myself met in council, and pondered how to get
at the Yarmuk section of the Palestine line to top off our cutting of
the Damascus and Hejaz Railways. In view of the reported opposition
there we must take nearly all our men, which seemed hardly wise under
such constant air observation. For one thing, the bombs might hurt us
badly on the march across the open plain; and for another, Peake’s
demolition party would be at the mercy of Deraa if the Turks plucked up
the courage to sally. For the moment they were fearful: but time might
make them brave.</p>
<p>While we hesitated, things were marvellously solved. Junor, the pilot
of the B.E. 12 machine, now alone at Azrak, had heard from the disabled
Murphy of the enemy machines about Deraa, and in his own mind decided to
take the Bristol Fighter’s place, and carry out the air programme. So
when things were at their thickest with us he suddenly sailed into the
circus.</p>
<p>We watched with mixed feelings, for his hopelessly old-fashioned
machine made him cold meat for any one of the enemy scouts or
two-seaters: but at first he astonished them, as he rattled in with his
two guns. They scattered for a careful look at this unexpected opponent.
He flew westward across the line, and they went after in pursuit, with
that amiable weakness of aircraft for a hostile machine, however
important the ground target.</p>
<p>We were left in perfect peace. Nuri caught at the lull to collect
three hundred and fifty regulars, with two of Pisani’s guns; and hurried
them over the saddle behind Tell Arar, on the first stage of their march
to Mezerib. If the aeroplanes gave us a half-hour’s law, they would
probably notice neither the lessened numbers by the mound, nor the
scattered groups making along every slope and hollow across the stubble
westward. This cultivated land had a quilt-work appearance from the air:
also the ground was tall with maize stalks, and thistles grew
saddle-high about it in great fields.</p>
<p>We sent the peasantry after the soldiers, and half an hour later I
was calling up my bodyguard that we might get to Mezerib before the
others, when again we heard the drone of engines; and, to our
astonishment, Junor reappeared, still alive, though attended on three
sides by enemy machines, spitting bullets. He was twisting and slipping
splendidly, firing back. Their very numbers hindered them but of course
the affair could have only one ending.</p>
<p>In the faint hope that he might get down intact we rushed towards the
railway where was a strip of ground, not too boulder-strewn. Everyone
helped to clear it at speed, while Junor was being driven lower. He
threw us a message to say his petrol was finished. We worked feverishly
for five minutes, and then put out a landing-signal. He dived at it, but
as he did so the wind flawed and blew across at a sharp angle. The
cleared strip was too little in any case. He took ground beautifully,
but the wind puffed across once more. His under-carriage went, and the
plane turned over in the rough.</p>
<p>We rushed up to rescue, but Junor was out, with no more hurt than a
cut on the chin. He took off his Lewis gun, and the Vickers, and the
drums of tracer ammunition for them. We threw everything into Young’s
Ford, and fled, as one of the Turkish two-seaters dived viciously and
dropped a bomb by the wreck.</p>
<p>Junor five minutes later was asking for another job. Joyce gave him a
Ford for himself, and he ran boldly down the line till near Deraa, and
blew a gap in the rails there, before the Turks saw him. They found such
zeal excessive, and opened on him with their guns: but he rattled away
again in his Ford, unhurt for the third time.</p>
