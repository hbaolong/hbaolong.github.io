<h4 id="chapter-lxxxvi">CHAPTER LXXXVI</h4>
<p>‘US’ proved to be about sixty men, clustered behind the ridge in two
bunches, one near the bottom, one by the top. The lower was made up of
peasants, on foot, blown, miserable, and yet the only warm things I had
seen that day. They said their ammunition was finished, and it was all
over. I assured them it was just beginning and pointed to my populous
reserve ridge, saying that all arms were there in support. I told them
to hurry back, refill their belts and hold on to it for good. Meanwhile
we would cover their retreat by sticking here for the few minutes yet
possible.</p>
<p>They ran off, cheered, and I walked about among the upper group
quoting how one should not quit firing from one position till ready to
fire from the next. In command was young Metaab, stripped to his skimp
riding-drawers for hard work, with his black love-curls awry, his face
stained and haggard. He was beating his hands together and crying
hoarsely with baffled vexation, for he had meant to do so well in this,
his first fight for us.</p>
<p>My presence at the last moment, when the Turks were breaking through,
was bitter; and he got angrier when I said that I only wanted to study
the landscape. He thought it flippancy, and screamed something about a
Christian going into battle unarmed. I retorted with a quip from
Clausewitz, about a rearguard effecting its purpose more by being than
by doing: but he was past laughter, and perhaps with justice, for the
little flinty bank behind which we sheltered was crackling with fire.
The Turks, knowing we were there, had turned twenty machineguns upon it.
It was four feet high and fifty feet long, of bare flinty ribs, off
which the bullets slapped deafeningly: while the air above so hummed or
whistled with ricochets and chips that it felt like death to look over.
Clearly we must leave very soon, and as I had no horse I went off first,
with Metaab’s promise that he would wait where he was if he dared, for
another ten minutes.</p>
<p>The run warmed me. I counted my paces, to help in ranging the Turks
when they ousted us; since there was only that one position for them,
and it was poorly protected against the south. In losing this Motalga
ridge we would probably win the battle. The horsemen held on for almost
their ten minutes, and then galloped off without hurt. Metaab lent me
his stirrup to hurry me along, till we found ourselves breathless among
the Ageyl. It was just noon, and we had leisure and quiet in which to
think.</p>
<p>Our new ridge was about forty feet up, and a nice shape for defence.
We had eighty men on it, and more were constantly arriving. My guards
were in place with their gun; Lutfi, an engine-destroyer, rushed up
hotly with his two, and after him came another hundred Ageyl. The thing
was becoming a picnic, and by saying ‘excellent’ and looking overjoyed,
we puzzled the men, and made them consider the position dispassionately.
The automatics were put on the skyline, with orders to fire occasional
shots, short, to disturb the Turks a little, but not too much, after the
expedient of Massena in delaying enemy deployment. Otherwise a lull
fell; I lay down in a sheltered place which caught a little sun, and no
wind, and slept a blessed hour, while the Turks occupied the old ridge,
extending over it like a school of geese, and about as wisely. Our men
left them alone, being contented with a free exhibition of
themselves.</p>
<p>In the middle of the afternoon Zeid arrived, with Mastur, Rasim and
Abdulla. They brought our main body, comprising twenty mounted infantry
on mules, thirty Motalga horsemen, two hundred villagers, five automatic
rifles, four machine-guns and the Egyptian Army mountain gun which had
fought about Medina, Petra and Jurf. This was magnificent, and I woke up
to welcome them.</p>
<p>The Turks saw us crowding, and opened with shrapnel and machine-gun
fire: but they had not the range and fumbled it. We reminded one another
that movement was the law of strategy, and started moving. Rasim became
a cavalry officer, and mounted with all our eighty riders of animals to
make a circuit about the eastern ridge and envelop the enemy’s left
wing, since the books advised attack not upon a line, but upon a point,
and by going far enough along any finite wing it would be found
eventually reduced to a point of one single man. Rasim liked this, my
conception of his target.</p>
<p>He promised, grinningly, to bring us that last man: but Hamd el Arar
took the occasion more fittingly. Before riding off he devoted himself
to the death for the Arab cause, drew his sword ceremoniously, and made
to it, by name, a heroic speech. Rasim took five automatic guns with
him; which was good.</p>
<p>We in the centre paraded about, so that their departure might be
unseen of the enemy, who were bringing up an apparently endless
procession of machine-guns and dressing them by the left at intervals
along the ridge as though in a museum. It was lunatic tactics. The ridge
was flint, without cover for a lizard. We had seen how, when a bullet
struck the ground, it and the ground spattered up in a shower of deadly
chips. Also we knew the range and elevated our Vickers guns carefully,
blessing their long, old-fashioned sights; our mountain gun was propped
into place ready to let go a sudden burst of shrapnel over the enemy
when Rasim was at grips.</p>
<p>As we waited, a reinforcement was announced of one hundred men from
Aima. They had fallen out with Zeid over war-wages the day previous, but
had grandly decided to sink old scores in the crisis. Their arrival
convinced us to abandon Marshal Foch and to attack from, at any rate,
three sides at once. So we sent the Aima men, with three automatic guns,
to outflank the right, or western wing. Then we opened against the Turks
from our central position, and bothered their exposed lines with hits
and ricochets.</p>
<p>The enemy felt the day no longer favourable. It was passing, and
sunset often gave victory to defenders yet in place. Old General Hamid
Fakhri collected his Staff and Headquarters, and told each man to take a
rifle. ‘I have been forty years a soldier, but never saw I rebels fight
like these. Enter the ranks’… but he was too late. Rasim pushed forward
an attack of his five automatic guns, each with its two-man crew. They
went in rapidly, unseen till they were in position, and crumpled the
Turkish left.</p>
<p>The Aima men, who knew every blade of grass on these, their own
village pastures, crept, unharmed, within three hundred yards of the
Turkish machine-guns. The enemy, held by our frontal threat, first knew
of the Aima men when they, by a sudden burst of fire, wiped out the
gun-teams and flung the right wing into disorder. We saw it, and cried
advance to the camel men and levies about us.</p>
<p>Mohamed el Ghasib, comptroller of Zeyd’s household, led them on his
camel, in shining wind-billowed robes, with the crimson banner of the
Ageyl over his head. All who had remained in the centre with us, our
servants, gunners and machine-gunners, rushed after him in a wide, vivid
line.</p>
<p>The day had been too long for me, and I was now only shaking with
desire to see the end: but Zeid beside me clapped his hands with joy at
the beautiful order of our plan unrolling in the frosty redness of the
setting sun. On the one hand Rasim’s cavalry were sweeping a broken left
wing into the pit beyond the ridge: on the other the men of Aima were
bloodily cutting down fugitives. The enemy centre was pouring back in
disorder through the gap, with our men after them on foot, on horse, on
camel. The Armenians, crouching behind us all day anxiously, now drew
their knives and howled to one another in Turkish as they leaped
forward.</p>
<p>I thought of the depths between here and Kerak, the ravine of Hesa,
with its broken, precipitous paths, the undergrowth, the narrows and
defiles of the way. It was going to be a massacre and I should have been
crying-sorry for the enemy; but after the angers and exertions of the
battle my mind was too tired to care to go down into that awful place
and spend the night saving them. By my decision to fight, I had killed
twenty or thirty of our six hundred men, and the wounded would be
perhaps three times as many. It was one-sixth of our force gone on a
verbal triumph, for the destruction of this thousand poor Turks would
not affect the issue of the war.</p>
<p>In the end we had taken their two mountain howitzers (Skoda guns,
very useful to us), twenty-seven machine-guns, two hundred horses and
mules, two hundred and fifty prisoners. Men said only fifty got back,
exhausted fugitives, to the railway. The Arabs on their track rose
against them and shot them ignobly as they ran. Our own men gave up the
pursuit quickly, for they were tired and sore and hungry, and it was
pitifully cold. A battle might be thrilling at the moment for generals,
but usually their imagination played too vividly beforehand, and made
the reality seem sham; so quiet and unimportant that they ranged about
looking for its fancied core. This evening there was no glory left, but
the terror of the broken flesh, which had been our own men, carried past
us to their homes.</p>
<p>As we turned back it began to snow; and only very late, and by a last
effort did we get our hurt men in. The Turkish wounded lay out, and were
dead next day. It was indefensible, as was the whole theory of war: but
no special reproach lay on us for it. We risked our lives in the
blizzard (the chill of victory bowing us down) to save our own fellows;
and if our rule was not to lose Arabs to kill even many Turks, still
less might we lose them to save Turks.</p>
<p>Next day and the next it snowed yet harder. We were weather-bound,
and as the days passed in monotony we lost the hope of doing. We should
have pushed past Kerak on the heels of victory, frighting the Turks to
Amman with our rumour: as it was, nothing came of all the loss and
effort, except a report which I sent over to the British headquarters in
Palestine for the Staff’s consumption. It was meanly written for effect,
full of quaint similes and mock simplicities; and made them think me a
modest amateur, doing his best after the great models; not a clown,
leering after them where they with Foch, band-master, at their head went
drumming down the old road of effusion of blood into the house of
Clausewitz. Like the battle, it was nearly-proof parody of regulation
use. Headquarters loved it, and innocently, to crown the jest, offered
me a decoration on the strength of it. We should have more bright
breasts in the Army if each man was able without witnesses, to write out
his own despatch.</p>
