<h4 id="chapter-lxxxi">CHAPTER LXXXI</h4>
<p>XURY, the Druse Emir of Salkhad, reached our old castle just before
me on his first visit to Sherif Ali. He told us the rest of the history
of the Emir Abd el Kader, the Algerian. After stealing away from us he
had ridden straight to their village, and entered in triumph, the Arab
flag displayed, and his seven horsemen cantering about him, firing
joy-shots. The people were astonished, and the Turkish Governor
protested that such doings were an insult to him. He was introduced to
Abd el Kader, who, sitting in pomp on the divan, made a bombastic
speech, stating that the Sherif now took over Jebel Druse through his
agency, and all existing officials were confirmed in their
appointments.</p>
<p>Next morning he made a second progress through the district. The
suffering Governor complained again. Emir Abd el Kader drew his
gold-mounted Meccan sword, and swore that with it he would cut off Jemal
Pasha’s head. The Druses reproved him, vowing that such things should
not be said in their house before his Excellency the Governor. Abd el
Kader called them whoresons, ingle’s accidents, sons of a bitch,
profiteering cuckolds and pimps, jetting his insults broadcast to the
roomful. The Druses got angry. Abd el Kader flung raging out of the
house and mounted, shouting that when he stamped his foot all Jebel
Druse would rise on his side.</p>
<p>With his seven servants, he spurred down the road to Deraa Station,
which he entered as he had entered Salkhad. The Turks, who knew his
madness of old, left him to play. They disbelieved even his yarn that
Ali and I would try the Yarmuk bridge that night. When, however, we did,
they took a graver view, and sent him under custody to Damascus. Jemal’s
brutal humour was amused, and he enlarged him as a butt. Abd el Kader
gradually became amenable. The Turks began to use him once more as agent
provocateur and dissipator of the energy generated by their local Syrian
nationalists.</p>
<p>The weather was now dreadful, with sleet and snow and storms
continually; it was obvious that at Azrak there would be nothing but
teaching and preaching in the next months. For this I was not eager.
When necessary, I had done my share of proselytizing fatigues,
converting as best I could; conscious all the time of my strangeness,
and of the incongruity of an alien’s advocating national liberty. The
war for me held a struggle to side-track thought, to get into the
people’s attitude of accepting the revolt naturally and trustingly. I
had to persuade myself that the British Government could really keep the
spirit of its promises. Especially was this difficult when I was tired
and ill, when the delirious activity of my brain tore to shreds my
patience. And then, after the blunt Beduin, who would thrust in, hailing
me ‘Ya Auruns’, and put their need without compliments, these smooth
townspeople were maddening as they crawled for the favour of an audience
with their Prince and Bey and Lord and Deliverer. Such imputed
dignities, like body armour in a duel, were no doubt useful; but
uncomfortable, and mean, too.</p>
<p>I had never been a lofty person; on the contrary I had tried to be
accessible to everyone, even if it continually felt as though most of
them came and saw me every day. I had striven as eloquently as I could
by my own example to keep plain the standard of existence. I had had no
tents, no cooks, no body-servants: just my guards, who were fighting
men, not servile: and behold these Byzantine shopkeepers endeavouring to
corrupt our simplicity! So I flung away from them in a rage, determined
to go south and see if anything active could be done, in the cold
weather, about the Dead Sea, which the enemy held as a trench dividing
us from Palestine.</p>
<p>My remaining money was handed over to Sherif Ali, for his maintenance
till the spring; and the Indians were commended to his care.
Particularly we bought them fresh riding-camels, in case the need to
move came suddenly upon them in the winter; though the daily news of a
threat by the Turks against Azrak was scornfully discounted by young
Ali. He and I took affectionate leave of one another. Ali gave me half
his wardrobe: shirts, head-cloths, belts, tunics. I gave him an
equivalent half of mine, and we kissed like David and Jonathan, each
wearing the other’s clothes. Afterwards, with Rahail only, on my two
best camels, I struck away southward.</p>
<p>We left Azrak one evening, riding into a glowing west, while over our
heads schools of cranes flew into the sunset like the out-drawn barbs of
arrows. It was toilsome from the start. Night was deep by Wadi Butum,
where the conditions became even worse. All the plain was wet, and our
poor camels slithered and fell time and again. We fell as often as they
did, but at least our part of sitting still, between falls, was easier
than their part of movement. By midnight we had crossed the Ghadaf and
the quag felt too awful for further progress. Also the mishandling at
Deraa had left me curiously faint; my muscles seemed at once pappy and
inflamed, and all effort frightened me in anticipation. So we
halted.</p>
<p>We slept where we were, in the mud; rose up plated with it at dawn;
and smiled crackily at one another. The wind blew, and the ground began
to dry. It was important, for I wanted to reach Akaba before Wood’s men
had left it with the return caravan, and their eight days’ start called
for speed. My body’s reluctance to ride hard was another (and perverse)
reason for forcing the march. Until noon we made poor travelling, for
the camels still broke through the loose crust of flints, and foundered
in the red under-clay. After noon, on the higher ground, we did better,
and began rapidly to close the white sky-tents which were the
Thlaithakhwat peaks.</p>
<p>Suddenly shots rang out at close range, and four mouthing men dashed
down the slope towards us. I stopped my camel peaceably. Seeing this
they jumped off, and ran to us brandishing their arms. They asked who I
was: volunteering that they were Jazi Howeitat. This was an open lie,
because their camel-brands were Faiz. They covered us with rifles at
four yards, and told us to dismount. I laughed at them, which was good
tactics with Beduin at a crisis. They were puzzled. I asked the loudest
if he knew his name. He stared at me, thinking I was mad. He came
nearer, with his finger on the trigger, and I bent down to him and
whispered that it must be ‘Teras’ since no other tradesman could be so
rude. As I spoke, I covered him with a pistol hidden under my cloak.</p>
<p>It was a shooting insult, but he was so astonished that anyone should
provoke an armed man, as to give up for the moment his thought of
murdering us. He took a step back, and looked around, fearful that there
was a reserve somewhere, to give us confidence. At once I rode off
slowly, with a creepy feeling in my back, calling Rahail to follow. They
let him go too, unhurt. When we were a hundred yards away, they repented
themselves, and began to shoot, but we dashed over the watershed into
the next depression, and across it cantered more confidently into safe
ground.</p>
<p>From the ridge at sunset we looked back for an instant upon the
northern plain, as it sank away from us greyly, save that here and there
glowed specks or great splashes of crimson fire, the reflection of the
dying sun in shallow pools of rain-water on the flats. These eyes of a
dripping bloody redness were so much more visible than the plain that
they carried our sight miles into the haze, and seemed to hang detached
in the distant sky, tilted up, like mirage.</p>
<p>We passed Bair long after dark, when only its latest tent-fires still
shone. As we went we saw the stars mirrored in a valley bottom, and were
able to water our breathless camels in a pool of yesterday’s rain. After
their drink, we eased them for half an hour. This night-journeying was
hard on both men and animals. By day the camels saw the irregularities
of their path, and undulated over them; and the rider could swing his
body to miss the jerk of a long or short stride: but by night everything
was blinded, and the march racked with shocks. I had a heavy bout of
fever on me, which made me angry, so that I paid no attention to
Rahail’s appeals for rest. That young man had maddened all of us for
months by his abundant vigour, and by laughing at our weaknesses; so
this time I was determined to ride him out, showing no mercy. Before
dawn he was blubbering with self-pity; but softly, lest I hear him.</p>
<p>Dawn in Jefer came imperceptibly through the mist like a ghost of
sunlight, which left the earth untouched, and demonstrated itself as a
glittering blink against the eyes alone. Things at their heads stood
matt against the pearl-grey horizon, and at their feet melted softly
into the ground. Our shadows had no edge: we doubted if that faint stain
upon the soil below was cast by us or not. In the forenoon we reached
Auda’s camp; and stopped for a greeting, and a few Jauf dates. Auda
could not provide us a relay of camels. We mounted again to get over the
railway in the early night. Rahail was past protest now. He rode beside
me white-faced, bleak and silent, wrought up only to outstay me,
beginning to take a half pride in his pains.</p>
<p>Even had we started fair, he had the advantage anyhow over me in
strength, and now I was nearly finished. Step by step I was yielding
myself to a slow ache which conspired with my abating fever and the numb
monotony of riding to close up the gate of my senses. I seemed at last
approaching the insensibility which had always been beyond my reach: but
a delectable land: for one born so slug-tissued that nothing this side
fainting would let his spirit free. Now I found myself dividing into
parts. There was one which went on riding wisely, sparing or helping
every pace of the wearied camel. Another hovering above and to the right
bent down curiously, and asked what the flesh was doing. The flesh gave
no answer, for, indeed, it was conscious only of a ruling impulse to
keep on and on; but a third garrulous one talked and wondered, critical
of the body’s self-inflicted labour, and contemptuous of the reason for
effort.</p>
<p>The night passed in these mutual conversations. My unseeing eyes saw
the dawn-goal in front; the head of the pass, below which that other
world of Rumm lay out like a sunlit map, and my parts debated that the
struggle might be worthy, but the end foolishness and a rebirth of
trouble. The spent body toiled on doggedly and took no heed, quite
rightly, for the divided selves said nothing which I was not capable of
thinking in cold blood; they were all my natives. Telesius, taught by
some such experience, split up the soul. Had he gone on, to the furthest
limit of exhaustion, he would have seen his conceived regiment of
thoughts and acts and feelings ranked around him as separate creatures;
eyeing, like vultures, the passing in their midst of the common thing
which gave them life.</p>
<p>Rahail collected me out of my death-sleep by jerking my head-stall
and striking me, while he shouted that we had lost our direction, and
were wandering towards the Turkish lines at Aba el Lissan. He was right,
and we had to make a long cut back to reach Batra safely. We walked down
the steeper portions of the pass, and then stumbled along Wadi Hafira.
In its midst a gallant little Howeiti, aged perhaps fourteen, darted out
against us, finger on trigger, and told us to stand and explain; which
we did, laughing. The lad blushed, and pleaded that his father’s camels
kept him always in the field so that he had not known us either by sight
or by description. He begged that we would not do him shame by betraying
his error. The incident broke the tension between Rahail and myself;
and, chatting, we rode out upon the Gaa. There under the tamarisk we
passed the middle hour of the day in sleep, since by our slowness in the
march over Batra we had lost the possibility of reaching Akaba within
the three days from Azrak. The breaking of our intention we took
quietly. Rumm’s glory would not let a man waste himself in feverish
regrets.</p>
<p>We rode up its valley in the early afternoon; easier now and
exchanging jests with one another, as the long winter evening crept
down. When we got past the Khazail in the ascent we found the sun veiled
behind the level banks of low clouds in the west, and enjoyed a rich
twilight of the English sort. In Itm the mist steamed up gently from the
soil, and collected into wool-white masses in each hollow. We reached
Akaba at midnight, and slept outside the camp till breakfast, when I
called on Joyce, and found the caravan not yet ready to start: indeed
Wood was only a few days returned.</p>
<p>Later came urgent orders for me to go up at once to Palestine by air.
Croil flew me to Suez. Thence I went up to Allenby’s headquarters beyond
Gaza. He was so full of victories that my short statement that we had
failed to carry a Yarmuk bridge was sufficient, and the miserable
details of failure could remain concealed.</p>
<p>While I was still with him, word came from Chetwode that Jerusalem
had fallen; and Allenby made ready to enter in the official manner which
the catholic imagination of Mark Sykes had devised. He was good enough,
although I had done nothing for the success, to let Clayton take me
along as his staff officer for the day. The personal Staff tricked me
out in their spare clothes till I looked like a major in the British
Army. Dalmeny lent me red tabs, Evans his brass hat; so that I had the
gauds of my appointment in the ceremony of the Jaffa gate, which for me
was the supreme moment of the war.</p>
<p>BOOK VII</p>
<p>THE DEAD SEA CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>Chapters LXXXII to XCI</p>
<p>AFTER the capture of Jerusalem, Allenby, to relieve his right,
assigned us a limited objective. We began well; but when we reached the
Dead Sea, bad weather, bad temper and division of purpose blunted our
offensive spirit and broke up our force.</p>
<p>I had a misunderstanding with Zeid, threw in my hand, and returned to
Palestine reporting that we had failed, and asking the favour of other
employment. Allenby was in the hopeful midst of a great scheme for the
coming spring. He sent me back at once to Feisal with new powers and
duties.</p>
