<h4 id="chapter-xxi">CHAPTER XXI</h4>
<p>XLIFE in Wejh was interesting. We had now set our camp in order.
Feisal pitched his tents (here an opulent group: living tents, reception
tents, staff tents, guest tents, servants’) about a mile from the sea,
on the edge of the coral shelf which ran up gently from the beach till
it ended in a steep drop facing east and south over broad valleys
radiating star-like from the land-locked harbour. The tents of soldiers
and tribesmen were grouped in these sandy valleys, leaving the chill
height for ourselves; and very delightful in the evening we northerners
found it when the breeze from the sea carried us a murmur of the waves,
faint and far off, like the echo of traffic up a by-street in
London.</p>
<p>Immediately beneath us were the Ageyl, an irregular close group of
tents. South of these were Rasim’s artillery; and by him for company,
Abdulla’s machine-gunners, in regular lines, with their animals picketed
out in those formal rows which were incense to the professional officer
and convenient if space were precious. Further out the market was set
plainly on the ground, a boiling swell of men always about the goods.
The scattered tents and shelters of the tribesmen filled each gully or
windless place. Beyond the last of them lay open country, with
camel-parties coming in and out by the straggling palms of the nearest,
too-brackish well. As background were the foothills, reefs and clusters
like ruined castles, thrown up craggily to the horizon of the coastal
range.</p>
<p>As it was the custom in Wejh to camp wide apart, very wide apart, my
life was spent in moving back and forth, to Feisal’s tents, to the
English tents, to the Egyptian Army tents, to the town, the port, the
wireless station, tramping all day restlessly up and down these coral
paths in sandals or barefoot, hardening my feet, getting by slow degrees
the power to walk with little pain over sharp and burning ground,
tempering my already trained body for greater endeavour.</p>
<p>Poor Arabs wondered why I had no mare; and I forbore to puzzle them
by incomprehensible talk of hardening myself, or confess I would rather
walk than ride for sparing of animals: yet the first was true and the
second true. Something hurtful to my pride, disagreeable, rose at the
sight of these lower forms of life. Their existence struck a servile
reflection upon our human kind: the style in which a God would look on
us; and to make use of them, to lie under an avoidable obligation to
them, seemed to me shameful. It was as with the negroes, tom-tom playing
themselves to red madness each night under the ridge. Their faces, being
clearly different from our own, were tolerable; but it hurt that they
should possess exact counterparts of all our bodies.</p>
<p>Feisal, within, laboured day and night at his politics, in which so
few of us could help. Outside, the crowd employed and diverted us with
parades, joy-shooting, and marches of victory. Also there were
accidents. Once a group, playing behind our tents, set off a seaplane
bomb, dud relic of Boyle’s capture of the town. In the explosion their
limbs were scattered about the camp, marking the canvas with red
splashes which soon turned a dull brown and then faded pale. Feisal had
the tents changed and ordered the bloody ones to be destroyed: the
frugal slaves washed them. Another day a tent took fire, and
part-roasted three of our guests. The camp crowded round and roared with
laughter till the fire died down, and then, rather shamefacedly, we
cared for their hurts. The third day, a mare was wounded by a falling
joy-bullet, and many tents were pierced.</p>
<p>One night the Ageyl mutinied against their commandant, ibn Dakhil,
for fining them too generally and flogging them too severely. They
rushed his tent, howling and shooting, threw his things about and beat
his servants. That not being enough to blunt their fury, they began to
remember Yenbo, and went off to kill the Ateiba. Feisal from our bluff
saw their torches and ran barefoot among them, laying on with the flat
of his sword like four men. His fury delayed them while the slaves and
horsemen, calling for help, dashed downhill with rushes and shouts and
blows of sheathed swords. One gave him a horse on which he charged down
the ringleaders, while we dispersed groups by firing Very lights into
their clothing. Only two were killed and thirty wounded. Ibn Dakhil
resigned next day.</p>
<p>Murray had given us two armoured-cars, Rolls-Royces, released from
the campaign in East Africa. Gilman and Wade commanded, and their crews
were British, men from the A.S.C. to drive and from the Machine Gun
Corps to shoot. Having them in Wejh made things more difficult for us,
because the food we had been eating and the water we had been drinking
were at once medically condemned; but English company was a balancing
pleasure, and the occupation of pushing cars and motor-bicycles through
the desperate sand about Wejh was great. The fierce difficulty of
driving across country gave the men arms like boxers, so that they swung
their shoulders professionally as they walked. With time they became
skilled, developing a style and art of sand-driving, which got them
carefully over the better ground and rushed them at speed over soft
places. One of these soft places was the last twenty miles of plain in
front of Jebal Raal. The cars used to cross it in little more than half
an hour, leaping from ridge to ridge of the dunes and swaying
dangerously around their curves. The Arabs loved the new toys. Bicycles
they called devil-horses, the children of cars, which themselves were
sons and daughters of trains. It gave us three generations of mechanical
transport.</p>
<p>The Navy added greatly to our interests in Wejh. The Espiegle was
sent by Boyle as station ship, with the delightful orders to ‘do
everything in her power to co-operate in the many plans which would be
suggested to her by Colonel Newcombe, while letting it be clearly seen
that she was conferring a favour’. Her commander Fitzmaurice (a good
name in Turkey), was the soul of hospitality and found quiet amusement
in our work on shore. He helped us in a thousand ways; above all in
signalling; for he was a wireless expert, and one day at noon the
Northbrook came in and landed an army wireless set, on a light lorry,
for us. As there was no one to explain it, we were at a loss; but
Fitzmaurice raced ashore with half his crew, ran the car to a fitting
site, rigged the masts professionally, started the engine, and connected
up to such effect that before sunset he had called the astonished
Northbrook and held a long conversation with her operator. The station
increased the efficiency of the base at Wejh and was busy day and night,
filling the Red Sea with messages in three tongues, and twenty different
sorts of army cypher-codes.</p>
