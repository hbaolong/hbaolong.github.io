<h4 id="privately-printed-texts">PRIVATELY PRINTED TEXTS</h4>
<p>Oxford 1922</p>
<p>THOUGH the story, as completed in Text III, appeared to me still
diffuse and unsatisfactory, yet for security’s sake it was set up and
printed textually, in sheets, at Oxford in the first quarter of 1922, by
care of the Oxford Times staff. Since eight copies were required, and
the book was very large, printing was preferred to typewriting. Five
copies (bound in book form, for the convenience of those former members
of the Hejaz Expeditionary Force who undertook to read it critically for
me) have not yet (April 1927) been destroyed.</p>
<p>Subscribers’ Text 1. xii. 26</p>
<p>This text, as issued to subscribers in December 1926 and January
1927, was a recension of the Oxford sheets of 1922. They were condensed
(the single canon of change being literary) during 1923 and 1924 (Royal
Tank Corps) and 1925 and 1926 (Royal Air Force) in my spare evenings.
Beginners in literature are inclined to fumble with a handful of
adjectives round the outline of what they want to describe: but by 1924
I had learnt my first lessons in writing, and was often able to combine
two or three of my 1921 phrases into one.</p>
<p>There were four exceptions to the rule of condensation:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>An incident, of less than a page, was cut out because two seniors
of our party thought it unpleasantly unnecessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Two characters of Englishmen were modified: one into nothing,
because the worm no longer seemed worth treading on: the other into
plain praise, because what I had innocently written as complaint was
read ambiguously by an authority well able to judge.</p></li>
<li><p>One chapter of the Introduction was omitted. My best critic told
me it was much inferior to the rest.</p></li>
<li><p>Book VIII, intended as a ‘flat’, to interpose between the
comparative excitements of Book VII and the final advance on Damascus,
was shortened of an abortive reconnaissance, some 10,000 words long.
Several of those who read the Oxford text complained of the inordinate
boredom of the ‘flat’, and upon reflection I agreed with them that it
was perhaps too successful.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By thus excising 3 per cent and condensing the rest of the Oxford
text a total reduction of 15 per cent was achieved, and the length of
the subscribers’ text brought down to some 280,000 words. It is swifter
and more pungent than the Oxford text; and it would have been improved
yet more if, I had had leisure to carry the process of revision
further.</p>
<p>The Seven Pillars was so printed and assembled that nobody but myself
knew how many copies were produced. I propose to keep this knowledge to
myself. Newspaper statements of 107 copies can be easily disproved, for
there were more than 107 subscribers: and in addition I gave away, not
perhaps as many copies as I owed, but as many as my bankers could
afford, to those who had shared with me in the Arab effort, or in the
actual production of the volume.</p>
