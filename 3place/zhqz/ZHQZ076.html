<h4 id="chapter-lxv">CHAPTER LXV</h4>
<p>QUIETLY we regained our camels and slept. Next morning we returned on
our tracks to let a fold of the plain hide us from the railway, and then
marched south across the sandy flat; seeing tracks of gazelle, oryx and
ostrich; with, in one spot, stale padmarks of leopard. We were making
for the low hills bounding the far side, intending to blow up a train;
for Zaal said that where these touched the railway was such a curve as
we needed for mine-laying, and that the spurs commanding it would give
us ambush and field of fire for our machine-guns.</p>
<p>So we turned east in the southern ridges till within half a mile of
the line. There the party halted in a thirty-foot valley, while a few of
us walked down to the line, which bent a little eastward to avoid the
point of higher ground under our feet. The point ended in a flat table
fifty feet above the track facing north across the valley.</p>
<p>The metals crossed the hollow on a high bank, pierced by a two-arched
bridge for the passage of rain-water. This seemed an ideal spot to lay
the charge. It was our first try at electric mining and we had no idea
what would happen; but it stood to our reason that the job would be more
sure with an arch under the explosive because, whatever the effect on
the locomotive, the bridge would go, and the succeeding coaches be
inevitably derailed.</p>
<p>The ledge would make an admirable position for Stokes. For the
automatics, it was rather high; but the enfilade would be masterful
whether the train was going up or down the line. So we determined to put
up with the disadvantages of plunging fire. It was good to have my two
British responsibilities in one place, safe from surprise and with an
independent retreat into the rough: for to-day Stokes was in pain with
dysentery. Probably the Mudowwara water had upset his stomach. So few
Englishmen seemed to have been endowed by their upbringing with any
organic resistance to disease.</p>
<p>Back with our camels, we dumped the loads, and sent the animals to
safe pasture near some undercut rocks from which the Arabs scraped salt.
The freedmen carried down the Stokes gun with its shells; the Lewis
guns; and the gelatine with its insulated wire, magneto and tools to the
chosen place. The sergeants set up their toys on a terrace, while we
went down to the bridge to dig a bed between the ends of two steel
sleepers, wherein to hide my fifty pounds of gelatine. We had stripped
off the paper wrapping of the individual explosive plugs and kneaded
them together by help of the sun-heat into a shaking jelly in a
sand-bag.</p>
<p>The burying of it was not easy. The embankment was steep, and in the
sheltered pocket between it and the hill-side was a wind-laid bank of
sand. No one crossed this but myself, stepping carefully; yet I left
unavoidable great prints over its smoothness. The ballast dug out from
the track I had to gather in my cloak for carriage in repeated journeys
to the culvert, whence it could be tipped naturally over the shingle bed
of the watercourse.</p>
<p>It took me nearly two hours to dig in and cover the charge: then came
the difficult job of unrolling the heavy wires from the detonator to the
hills whence we would fire the mine. The top sand was crusted and had to
be broken through in burying the wires. They were stiff wires, which
scarred the wind-rippled surface with long lines like the belly marks of
preposterously narrow and heavy snakes. When pressed down in one place
they rose into the air in another. At last they had to be weighted down
with rocks which, in turn, had to be buried at the cost of great
disturbance of the ground.</p>
<p>Afterwards it was necessary, with a sand-bag, to stipple the marks
into a wavy surface; and, finally, with a bellows and long fanning
sweeps of my cloak, to simulate the smooth laying of the wind. The whole
job took five hours to finish; but then it was well finished: neither
myself nor any of us could see where the charge lay, or that double
wires led out underground from it to the firing point two hundred yards
off, behind the ridge marked for our riflemen.</p>
<p>The wires were just long enough to cross from this ridge into a
depression. There we brought up the two ends and connected them with the
electric exploder. It was an ideal place both for it and the man who
fired it, except that the bridge was not visible thence.</p>
<p>However, this only meant that someone would have to press the handle
at a signal from a point fifty yards ahead, commanding the bridge and
the ends of the wire alike. Salem, Feisal’s best slave, asked for this
task of honour, and was yielded it by acclamation. The end of the
afternoon was spent in showing him (on the disconnected exploder) what
to do, till he was act-perfect and banged down the ratchet precisely as
I raised my hand with an imaginary engine on the bridge.</p>
<p>We walked back to camp, leaving one man on watch by the line. Our
baggage was deserted, and we stared about in a puzzle for the rest, till
we saw them suddenly sitting against the golden light of sunset along a
high ridge. We yelled to them to lie down or come down, but they
persisted up there on their perch like a school of hooded crows, in full
view of north and south.</p>
<p>At last we ran up and threw them off the skyline, too late. The Turks
in a little hill-post by Hallat Ammar, four miles south of us, had seen
them, and opened fire in their alarm upon the long shadows which the
declining sun was pushing gradually up the slopes towards the post.
Beduin were past masters in the art of using country, but in their
abiding contempt for the stupidity of the Turks they would take no care
to fight them. This ridge was visible at once from Mudowwara and Hallat
Ammar, and they had frightened both places by their sudden ominous
expectant watch.</p>
<p>However, the dark closed on us, and we knew we must sleep away the
night patiently in hope of the morrow. Perhaps the Turks would reckon us
gone if our place looked deserted in the morning. So we lit fires in a
deep hollow, baked bread and were comfortable. The common tasks had made
us one party, and the hill-top folly shamed everyone into agreement that
Zaal should be our leader.</p>
<p>Day broke quietly, and for hours we watched the empty railway with
its peaceful camps. The constant care of Zaal and of his lame cousin
Howeimil, kept us hidden, though with difficulty, because of the
insatiate restlessness of the Beduin, who would never sit down for ten
minutes, but must fidget and do or say something. This defect made them
very inferior to the stolid English for the long, tedious strain of a
waiting war. Also it partly accounted for their uncertain stomachs in
defence. To-day they made us very angry.</p>
<p>Perhaps, after all, the Turks saw us, for at nine o’clock some forty
men came out of the tents on the hill-top by Hallat Ammar to the south
and advanced in open order. If we left them alone, they would turn us
off our mine in an hour; if we opposed them with our superior strength
and drove them back, the railway would take notice, and traffic be held
up. It was a quandary, which eventually we tried to solve by sending
thirty men to check the enemy patrol gradually; and, if possible, to
draw them lightly aside into the broken hills. This might hide our main
position and reassure them as to our insignificant strength and
purpose.</p>
<p>For some hours it worked as we had hoped; the firing grew desultory
and distant. A permanent patrol came confidently up from the south and
walked past our hill, over our mine and on towards Mudowwara without
noticing us. There were eight soldiers and a stout corporal, who mopped
his brow against the heat, for it was now after eleven o’clock and
really warm. When he had passed us by a mile or two the fatigue of the
tramp became too much for him. He marched his party into the shade of a
long culvert, under whose arches a cool draught from the east was gently
flowing, and there in comfort they lay on the soft sand, drank water
from their bottles, smoked, and at last slept. We presumed that this was
the noon-day rest which every solid Turk in the hot summer of Arabia
took as a matter of principle, and that their allowing themselves the
pause showed that we were disproved or ignored. However, we were in
error.</p>
