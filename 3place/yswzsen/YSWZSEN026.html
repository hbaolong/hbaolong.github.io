<h4 id="chapter-25">Chapter 25</h4>
<p>How Arthur by the mean of Merlin gat Excalibur his sword of the Lady
of the Lake</p>
<p>Right so the king and he departed, and went until an hermit that was
a good man and a great leech. So the hermit searched all his wounds and
gave him good salves; so the king was there three days, and then were
his wounds well amended that he might ride and go, and so departed.</p>
<p>And as they rode, Arthur said, ‘I have no sword.’</p>
<p>‘No force,’ said Merlin, ‘hereby is a sword that shall be yours, and
I may.’</p>
<p>So they rode till they came to a lake, the which was a fair water and
broad, and in the midst of the lake Arthur was ware of an arm clothed in
white samite, that held a fair sword in that hand.</p>
<p>‘Lo!’ said Merlin, ‘yonder is that sword that I spake of.’</p>
<p>With that they saw a damosel going upon the lake.</p>
<p>‘What damosel is that?’ said Arthur.</p>
<p>‘That is the Lady of the Lake,’ said Merlin; ‘and within that lake is
a rock, and therein is as fair a place as any on earth, and richly
beseen; and this damosel will come to you anon, and then speak ye fair
to her that she will give you that sword.’</p>
<p>Anon withal came the damosel unto Arthur, and saluted him, and he her
again.</p>
<p>‘Damosel,’ said Arthur, ‘what sword is that, that yonder the arm
holdeth above the water? I would it were mine, for I have no sword.’</p>
<p>‘Sir Arthur, king,’ said the damosel, ‘that sword is mine, and if ye
will give me a gift when I ask it you, ye shall have it.’</p>
<p>‘By my faith,’ said Arthur, ‘I will give you what gift ye will
ask.’</p>
<p>‘Well!’ said the damosel, ‘Go ye into yonder barge, and row yourself
to the sword, and take it and the scabbard with you, and I will ask my
gift when I see my time.’</p>
<p>So Sir Arthur and Merlin alit and tied their horses to two trees, and
so they went into the ship, and when they came to the sword that the
hand held, Sir Arthur took it up by the handles, and took it with him,
and the arm and the hand went under the water, and so came unto the land
and rode forth, and then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion.</p>
<p>‘What signifieth yonder pavilion?’</p>
<p>‘It is the knight’s pavilion,’ said Merlin, ‘that ye fought with
last, Sir Pellinor; but he is out, he is not there. He hath ado with a
knight of yours that hight Egglame, and they have foughten together, but
at the last Egglame fled, and else he had been dead, and he hath chased
him even to Caerleon, and we shall meet with him anon in the
highway.’</p>
<p>‘That is well said,’ said Arthur, ‘now have I a sword, now will I
wage battle with him, and be avenged on him.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, ye shall not so,’ said Merlin, ‘for the knight is weary of
fighting and chasing, so that ye shall have no worship to have ado with
him; also he will not be lightly matched of one knight living, and
therefore it is my counsel, let him pass, for he shall do you good
service in short time, and his sons after his days. Also ye shall see
that day in short space, ye shall be right glad to give him your sister
to wed.’</p>
<p>‘When I see him, I will do as ye advise me,’ said Arthur.</p>
<p>Then Sir Arthur looked on the sword, and liked it passing well.</p>
<p>‘Whether liketh you better,’ said Merlin, ‘the sword or the
scabbard?’</p>
<p>‘Me liketh better the sword,’ said Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Ye are more unwise,’ said Merlin, ‘for the scabbard is worth ten of
the swords, for whiles ye have the scabbard upon you, ye shall never
lose no blood be ye never so sore wounded, therefore keep well the
scabbard always with you.’</p>
<p>So they rode unto Caerleon, and by the way they met with Sir
Pellinor; but Merlin had done such a craft, that Pellinor saw not
Arthur, and he passed by without any words.</p>
<p>‘I marvel,’ said Arthur, ‘that the knight would not speak.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Merlin, ‘he saw you not, for and he had seen you, ye had
not lightly departed.’</p>
<p>So they came unto Caerleon, whereof his knights were passing glad.
And when they heard of his adventures, they marvelled that he would
jeopard his person so, alone. But all men of worship said it was merry
to be under such a chieftain, that would put his person in adventure as
other poor knights did.</p>
<p>‘No force’: ‘That does not matter.’ samite: a rich silk material.</p>
