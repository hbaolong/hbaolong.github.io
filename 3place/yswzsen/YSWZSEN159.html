<h4 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h4>
<p>How Sir Marhaus came out of Ireland for to ask truage of Cornwall, or
else he would fight therefore</p>
<p>Then it befell that King Agwisance of Ireland sent unto King Mark of
Cornwall for his truage, that Cornwall had paid many winters. And all
that time King Mark was behind of the truage for seven years.</p>
<p>And King Mark and his barons gave unto the messenger of Ireland,
these words and answer, that they would none pay; and bad the messenger
go unto his king Agwisance, ‘And tell him we will pay him no truage, but
tell your lord, and he will always have truage of us of Cornwall, bid
him send a trusty knight of his land, that will fight for his right, and
we shall find another for to defend our right.’</p>
<p>With this answer the messengers departed into Ireland. And when King
Agwisance understood the answer of the messengers he was wonderly wroth.
And then he called unto him Sir Marhaus, the good knight, that was nobly
proved, and a knight of the Table Round. And this Marhaus was brother
unto the Queen of Ireland. Then the king said thus: ‘Fair brother, Sir
Marhaus, I pray you go into Cornwall for my sake, and do battle for our
truage that of right we ought to have; and whatsomever ye spend ye shall
have sufficiently more than ye shall need.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Marhaus, ‘wit ye well that I shall not be loth to do
battle in the right of you and your land with the best knight of the
Table Round; for I know them, for the most part, what be their deeds;
and for to advance my deeds and to increase my worship I will right
gladly go unto this journey for our right.’</p>
<p>So in all haste there was made purveyance for Sir Marhaus, and he had
all thing that to him needed; and so he departed out of Ireland, and
arrived up in Cornwall even fast by the Castle of Tintagel. And when
King Mark understood that he was there arrived to fight for Ireland,
then made King Mark great sorrow when he understood that the good and
noble knight Sir Marhaus was come. For they knew no knight that durst
have ado with him. For at that time Sir Marhaus was called one of the
famousest and renowned knights of the world.</p>
<p>And thus Sir Marhaus abode in the sea, and every day he sent unto
King Mark for to pay the truage that was behind of seven year,
other-else to find a knight to fight with him for the truage. This
manner of message Sir Marhaus sent daily unto King Mark.</p>
<p>Then they of Cornwall let make cries in every place, that what knight
would fight for to save the truage of Cornwall, he should be rewarded so
that he should fare the better the term of his life.</p>
<p>Then some of the barons said to King Mark, and counselled him to send
to the court of King Arthur for to seek Sir Launcelot du Luke, that was
that time named for the marvelloust knight of all the world. Then there
were some other barons that counselled the king not to do so, and said
that it was labour in vain, because Sir Marhaus was a knight of the
Round Table, ‘therefore any of them will be loth to have ado with other,
but if it were any knight at his own request would fight disguised and
unknown.’ So the king and all his barons assented that it was no boot to
seek any knight of the Round Table.</p>
<p>This meanwhile came the language and the noise unto King Meliodas,
how that Sir Marhaus abode battle fast by Tintagel, and how King Mark
could find no manner knight to fight for him. When young Tristram heard
of this he was wroth, and sore ashamed that there durst no knight in
Cornwall have ado with Sir Marhaus of Ireland.</p>
<p>dissever: distinguish.</p>
