<h4 id="chapter-22">Chapter 22</h4>
<p>How Sir Gawain came to the Lady Ettard and lay by her, and how Sir
Pelleas found them sleeping</p>
<p>And therewith Sir Gawain plight his troth unto Sir Pelleas to be true
and faithful unto him; so each one plight their troth to other, and so
they changed horses and harness, and Sir Gawain departed, and came to
the castle whereas stood the pavilions of this lady without the
gate.</p>
<p>And as soon as Ettard had espied Sir Gawain she fled in toward the
castle.</p>
<p>Sir Gawain spake on high, and bad her abide, for he was not Sir
Pelleas; ‘I am another knight that have slain Sir Pelleas.’</p>
<p>‘Do off your helm,’ said the Lady Ettard, ‘that I may see your
visage.’</p>
<p>And so when she saw that it was not Sir Pelleas, she made him alight
and led him unto her castle, and asked him faithfully whether he had
slain Sir Pelleas. And he said her yea, and told her his name was Sir
Gawain of the court of King Arthur, and his sister’s son.</p>
<p>‘Truly,’ said she, ‘that is great pity, for he was a passing good
knight of his body, but of all men alive I hated him most, for I could
never be quit of him; and for ye have slain him I shall be your woman,
and to do anything that might please you.’ So she made Sir Gawain good
cheer.</p>
<p>Then Sir Gawain said that that he loved a lady and by no mean she
would love him.</p>
<p>‘She is to blame’ said Ettard, ‘and she will not love you, for ye
that be so well born a man, and such a man of prowess, there is no lady
in the world too good for you.’</p>
<p>‘Will ye,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘promise me to do all that ye may, by the
faith of your body, to get me the love of my lady?’</p>
<p>‘Yea, sir,’ said she, ‘and that I promise you by the faith of my
body.’</p>
<p>‘Now,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘it is yourself that I love so well,
therefore I pray you hold your promise.’</p>
<p>‘I may not choose,’ said the Lady Ettard, ‘but if I should be
forsworn;’ and so she granted him to fulfil all his desire.</p>
<p>So it was then in the month of May that she and Sir Gawain went out
of the castle and supped in a pavilion, and there was made a bed, and
there Sir Gawain and the Lady Ettard went to bed together, and in
another pavilion she laid her damosels, and in the third pavilion she
laid part of her knights, for then she had no dread of Sir Pelleas. And
there Sir Gawain lay with her in that pavilion two days and two
nights.</p>
<p>And on the third day, in the morning early Sir Pelleas armed him, for
he had never slept since Sir Gawain departed from him; for Sir Gawain
had promised him by the faith of his body, to come to him unto his
pavilion by that priory within the space of a day and a night. Then Sir
Pelleas mounted upon horseback, and came to the pavilions that stood
without the castle, and found in the first pavilion three knights in
three beds, and three squires lying at their feet. Then went he to the
second pavilion and found four gentlewomen lying in four beds. And then
he yede to the third pavilion and found Sir Gawain lying in bed with his
Lady Ettard, and either clipping other in arms, and when he saw that his
heart wellnigh brast for sorrow, and said, ‘Alas! that ever a knight
should be found so false;’ and then he took his horse and might not
abide no longer for pure sorrow.</p>
<p>And when he had ridden nigh half a mile he turned again and thought
to slay them both; and when he saw them both so lie sleeping fast,
unnethe he might hold him on horseback for sorrow, and said thus to
himself: ‘Though this knight be never so false, I will never slay him
sleeping, for I will never destroy the high order of knighthood;’ and
therewith he departed again.</p>
<p>And or he had ridden half a mile he returned again, and thought then
to slay them both, making the greatest sorrow that ever man made. And
when he came to the pavilions he tied his horse unto a tree, and pulled
out his sword naked in his hand, and went to them thereas they lay, and
yet he thought it were shame to slay them sleeping, and laid the naked
sword overthwart both their throats, and so took his horse and rode his
way.</p>
<p>And when Sir Pelleas came to his pavilions he told his knights and
his squires how he had sped, and said thus to them: ‘For your true and
good service ye have done me I shall give you all my goods, for I will
go unto my bed and never arise until I am dead. And when that I am dead
I charge you that ye take the heart out of my body and bear it her
betwixt two silver dishes, and tell her how I saw her lie with the false
knight Sir Gawain.’ Right so Sir Pelleas unarmed himself, and went unto
his bed making marvellous dole and sorrow.</p>
<p>Then Sir Gawain and Ettard awoke of their sleep, and found the naked
sword overthwart their throats, then she knew well it was Sir Pelleas’
sword.</p>
<p>‘Alas!’ said she to Sir Gawain, ‘ye have betrayed me and Sir Pelleas
both, for ye told me ye had slain him, and now I know well it is not so,
he is alive. And if Sir Pelleas had been as uncourteous to you as ye
have been to him ye had been a dead knight. But ye have deceived me and
betrayed me falsely, that all ladies and damosels may beware by you and
me.’</p>
<p>And therewith Sir Gawain made him ready, and went into the
forest.</p>
<p>So it happed then that the Damosel of the Lake, Nimue, met with a
knight of Sir Pelleas, that went on his foot in the forest making great
dole, and she asked him the cause. And so the woeful knight told her how
his master and lord was betrayed through a knight and a lady, and how
‘he will never arise out of his bed till he be dead.’</p>
<p>‘Bring me to him,’ said she anon, ‘and I will warrant his life he
shall not die for love, and she that hath caused him so to love, she
shall be in as evil plight as he is or it be long to, for it is no joy
of such a proud lady that will have no mercy of such a valiant
knight.’</p>
<p>Anon that knight brought her unto him, and when she saw him lie in
his bed, she thought she saw never so likely a knight; and therewith she
threw an enchantment upon him, and he fell asleep.</p>
<p>And therewhile she rode unto the Lady Ettard, and charged no man to
awake him till she came again. So within two hours she brought the Lady
Ettard thither, and both ladies found him asleep.</p>
<p>‘Lo,’ said the Damosel of the Lake, ‘ye ought to be ashamed for to
murder such a knight.’ And therewith she threw such an enchantment upon
her that she loved him sore that well nigh she was out of her mind.</p>
<p>‘O Lord Jesu,’ said the Lady Ettard, ‘how is it befallen unto me that
I love now him that I have most hated of any man alive?’</p>
<p>‘That is the rightwise judgement of God’ said the damosel.</p>
<p>And then anon Sir Pelleas awaked and looked upon Ettard; and when he
saw her he knew her, and then he hated her more than any woman alive,
and said, ‘Away, traitress, come never in my sight.’</p>
<p>And when she heard him say so, she wept and made great sorrow out of
measure.</p>
<p>clipping: embracing.</p>
