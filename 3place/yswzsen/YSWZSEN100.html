<h4 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h4>
<p>Of a battle done by Gawain against a Saracen, which after was yielden
and became Christian</p>
<p>Then they took their spears and ran each at other with all the might
they had, and smote each other through their shields into their
shoulders, wherefore anon they pulled out their swords, and smote great
strokes that the fire sprang out of their helms. Then Sir Gawain was all
abashed, and with Galatine his good sword he smote through shield and
thick hauberk made of thick mails, and all to-rushed and brake the
precious stones, and made him a large wound, that men might see both
liver and lung. Then groaned that knight, and addressed him to Sir
Gawain, and with an awke stroke gave him a great wound and cut a vein,
which grieved Gawain sore, and he bled sore.</p>
<p>Then the knight said to Sir Gawain, ‘Bind thy wound or thy blee
change, for thou be-bleedest all thy horse and thy fair arms, for all
the barbers of Brittany shall not can staunch thy blood, for whosomever
is hurt with this blade he shall never be staunched of bleeding.’</p>
<p>Then answered Gawain, ‘It grieveth me but little, thy great words
shall not fear me ne less my courage, but thou shalt suffer tene and
sorrow or we depart, but tell me in haste who may staunch my
bleeding.’</p>
<p>fewtered his spear: fixed his spear in its rest. grame: harm.
to-rushed: smashed. awke: back-handed. blee: complexion. can staunch: be
able to staunch.</p>
<p>‘That may I do,’ said the knight, ‘if I will, and so will I if thou
wilt succour and aid me, that I may be christened and believe on God,
and thereof I require thee of thy manhood, and it shall be great merit
for thy soul.’</p>
<p>‘I grant,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘so God help me, to accomplish all thy
desire, but first tell me what thou soughtest here thus alone, and of
what land and liegiance thou art of.’</p>
<p>‘Sir’ he said, ‘my name is Priamus, and a great prince is my father,
and he hath been rebel unto Rome and overriden many of their lands. My
father is lineally descended of Alexander and of Hector by right line.
And Duke Joshua and Maccabæus were of our lineage. I am right inheritor
of Alexandria and Africa, and all the out isles, yet will I believe on
thy Lord that thou believest on; and for thy labour I shall give thee
treasure enough. I was so elate and hautain in my heart that I thought
no man my peer, ne to me semblable. I was sent into this war with seven
score knights, and now I have encountered with thee, which hast given to
me of fighting my fill, wherefore sir knight, I pray thee to tell me
what thou art.’</p>
<p>‘I am no knight’ said Gawain, ‘I have been brought up in the
guardrobe with the noble King Arthur many years, for to take heed to his
armour and his other array, and to point his paltocks that longen to
himself. At Yule last he made me yeoman, and gave to me horse and
harness, and an hundred pound in money; and if fortune be my friend, I
doubt not but to be well advanced and holpen by my liege lord.’</p>
<p>‘Ah’ said Priamus, ‘if his knaves be so keen and fierce, his knights
be passing good. Now for the King’s love of Heaven, whether thou be a
knave or a knight, tell thou me thy name.’</p>
<p>‘By God’ said Sir Gawain, ‘now will I say thee sooth, my name is Sir
Gawain, and known I am in his court and in his chamber, and one of the
knights of the Round Table, he dubbed me a duke with his own hand.
Therefore grudge not if this grace is to me fortuned, it is the goodness
of God that lent to me my strength.’</p>
<p>semblable: comparable. hautain: haughty. guardrobe: wardrobe. point:
lace. paltocks: doublets.</p>
<p>‘Now am I better pleased,’ said Priamus, ‘than thou hadst given to me
all the Provence and Paris the rich. I had lever to have been torn with
wild horses, than any varlet had won such loos, or any page or priker
should have had prize on me. But now sir knight I warn thee that hereby
is a Duke of Lorraine with his army, and the noblest men of Dauphiné,
and lords of Lombardy, with the garnison of Gotthard, and Saracens of
Southland, numbered sixty thousand of good men of arms; wherefore but if
we hie us hence, it will harm us both, for we be sore hurt, never like
to recover; but take heed to my page, that he no horn blow, for if he
do, there be hoving here fast by an hundred knights awaiting on my
person, and if they take thee, there shall no ransom of gold ne silver
acquit thee.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Gawain rode over a water for to save him, and the knight
followed him, and so rode forth till they came to his fellows which were
in the meadow, where they had been all the night. Anon as Sir Wisshard
was ware of Sir Gawain and saw that he was hurt, he ran to him
sorrowfully weeping, and demanded of him who had so hurt him; and Gawain
told how he had foughten with that man, and each of them had hurt other,
and how he had salves to heal them; ‘but I can tell you other tidings,
that soon we shall have ado with many enemies.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Priamus and Sir Gawain alighted, and let their horses graze
in the meadow, and unarmed them, and then the blood ran freshly from
their wounds. And Priamus took from his page a vial full of the four
waters that came out of Paradise, and with certain balm anointed their
wounds, and washed them with that water, and within an hour after they
were both as whole as ever they were.</p>
<p>And then with a trumpet were they all assembled to council, and there
Priamus told unto them what lords and knights had sworn to rescue him,
and that without fail they should be assailed with many thousands,
wherefore he counselled them to withdraw them.</p>
<p>Then Sir Gawain said it were great shame to them to avoid without any
strokes; ‘wherefore I advise to take our arms and to make us ready to
meet with these Saracens and misbelieving men, and with the help of God
we shall overthrow them and have a fair day on them. And Sir Florence
shall abide still in this field to keep the stale as a noble knight, and
we shall not forsake yonder fellows.’</p>
<p>‘Now,’ said Priamus, ‘cease your words, for I warn you ye shall find
in yonder woods many perilous knights; they will put forth beasts to
call you on, they be out of number, and ye are not past seven hundred,
which be over few to fight with so many.’</p>
<p>‘Nevertheless,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘we shall once encounter-them, and
see what they can do, and the best shall have the victory.’</p>
<p>loos: renown. garnison: garrison.</p>
