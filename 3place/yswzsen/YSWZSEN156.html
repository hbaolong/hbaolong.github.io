<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram de Liones was born, and how his mother died at his
birth, wherefore she named him Tristram</p>
<p>It was a king that hight Meliodas, and he was lord and king of the
country of Liones, and this Meliodas was a likely knight as any was that
time living. And by fortune he wedded King Mark’s sister of Cornwall,
and she was called Elizabeth, that was called both good and fair.</p>
<p>And at that time King Arthur reigned, and he was whole king of
England, Wales, and Scotland, and of many other realms: howbeit there
were many kings that were lords of many countries, but all they held
their lands of King Arthur; for in Wales were two kings, and in the
north were many kings; and in Cornwall and in the west were two kings;
also in Ireland were two or three kings, and all were under the
obeissance of King Arthur. So was the King of France, and the King of
Brittany, and all the lordships unto Rome.</p>
<p>So when this Meliodas had been with his wife, within a while she
waxed great with child, and she was a full meek lady, and well she loved
her lord, and he her again, so there was great joy betwixt them.</p>
<p>Then there was a lady in that country that had loved King Meliodas
long, and by no mean she never could get his love; therefore she let
ordain upon a day, as King Meliodas rode on hunting, for he was a great
chaser, and there by an enchantment she made him chase an hart by
himself alone till that he came to an old castle, and there anon he was
taken prisoner by the lady that him loved.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth, King Meliodas’ wife,1 missed her lord, and she was
nigh out of her wit, and also, as great with child as she was, she took
a gentlewoman with her, and ran into the forest to seek her lord. And
when she was far in the forest she might no farther, for she began to
travail fast of her child. And she had many grimly throes; her
gentlewoman help her all that she might, and so by miracle of Our Lady
of Heaven she was delivered with great pains. But she had taken such
cold for the default of help that deep draughts of death took her, that
needs she must die and depart out of this world, there was none other
boot.</p>
<p>And when this Queen Elizabeth saw that there was none other boot,
then she made great dole, and said unto her gentlewoman, ‘When ye see my
lord, King Meliodas, recommend me unto him, and tell him what pains I
endure here for his love and how I must die here for his sake for
default of good help; and let him wit that I am full sorry to depart out
of this world from him, therefore pray him to be friend to my soul. Now
let me see my little child, for whom I have had all this sorrow.’</p>
<p>And when she saw him she said thus: ‘Ah, my little son, thou hast
murdered thy mother, and therefore I suppose, thou that art a murderer
so young, thou art full likely to be a manly man in thine age. And
because I shall die of the birth of thee, I charge thee, gentlewoman,
that thou pray my lord, King Meliodas, that when he is christened let
call him Tristram, that is as much to say as a sorrowful birth.’</p>
<p>And therewith this queen gave up the ghost and died. Then the
gentlewoman laid her under an umbre of a great tree, and then she lapped
the child as well as she might for cold.</p>
<p>Right so there came the barons, following after the queen, and when
they saw that she was dead, and understood none other but the king was
destroyed.</p>
