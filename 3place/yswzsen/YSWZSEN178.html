<h4 id="chapter-23">Chapter 23</h4>
<p>How Sir Blamor desired Tristram to slay him, and how Sir Tristram
spared him, and how they took appointment</p>
<p>Then when Sir Blamor might speak, he said thus:</p>
<p>‘Sir Tristram de Liones, I require thee, as thou art a noble knight,
and the best knight that ever I found, that thou wilt slay me out, for I
would not live to be made lord of all the earth, for I have lever die
with worship than live with shame; and needs, Sir Tristram, thou must
slay me, or else thou shalt never win the field, for I will never say
the loth word. And therefore if thou dare slay me, slay me, I require
thee.’</p>
<p>When Sir Tristram heard him say so knightly, he wist not what to do
with him, he remembering him of both parts, of what blood he was comen,
and for Sir Launcelot’s sake he would be loth to slay him; and in the
other part in no wise he might not choose, but that he must make him to
say the loth word, or else to slay him.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram start aback, and went to the kings that were
judges, and there he kneeled down tofore them, and besought them for
their worships, and for King Arthur’s and Sir Launcelot’s sake, that
they would take this matter in their hands. ‘For, my fair lords,’ said
Sir Tristram, ‘it were shame and pity that this noble knight that yonder
lieth should be slain; for ye hear well, shamed will he not be, and I
pray to God that he never be slain nor shamed for me. And as for the
king for whom I fight for, I shall require him, as I am his true
champion and true knight in this field, that he will have mercy upon
this knight.’</p>
<p>‘So God me help,’ said King Agwisance, ‘I will for your sake, Sir
Tristram, be ruled as ye will have me, for I know you for my true
knight; and therefore I will heartily pray the kings that be here as
judges to take it in their hands.’</p>
<p>And the kings that were judges called Sir Bleoberis to them, and
asked him his advice.</p>
<p>‘My lords,’ said Bleoberis, ‘though my brother be beaten, and hath
the worse through might of arms, I dare say, though Sir Tristram hath
beaten his body he hath not beaten his heart, and I thank God he is not
shamed this day; and rather than he should be shamed I require you,’
said Bleoberis, ‘let Sir Tristram slay him out.’</p>
<p>‘It shall not be so,’ said the kings, ‘for his party adversary, both
the king and the champion, have pity of Sir Blamor’s knighthood.’</p>
<p>‘My lords,’ said Bleoberis, ‘I will right well as ye will.’</p>
<p>Then the kings called the King of Ireland, and found him goodly and
treatable. And then, by all their advices, Sir Tristram and Sir
Bleoberis took up Sir Blamor, and the two brethren were accorded with
King Agwisance, and kissed and made friends for ever. And then Sir
Blamor and Sir Tristram kissed together, and there they made their oaths
that they would never none of them two brethren fight with Sir Tristram,
and Sir Tristram made the same oath. And for that gentle battle all the
blood of Sir Launcelot loved Sir Tristram for ever.</p>
<p>Then King Agwisance and Sir Tristram took their leave, and sailed
into Ireland with great noblesse and joy. So when they were in Ireland
the king let make it known throughout all the land how and in what
manner Sir Tristram had done for him. Then the queen and all that there
were made the most of him that they might. But the joy that La Beale
Isoud made of Sir Tristram there might no tongue tell, for of all men
earthly she loved him most.</p>
