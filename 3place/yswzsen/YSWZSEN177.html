<h4 id="chapter-22">Chapter 22</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram fought for Sir Agwisance and overcame his adversary,
and how his adversary would never yield him</p>
<p>‘Now make your answer that your champion is ready, for I shall die in
your quarrel rather than to be recreant.’</p>
<p>‘I have no doubt of you,’ said the king, ‘that and ye should have ado
with Sir Launcelot du Lake.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘as for Sir Launcelot, he is called the
noblest knight of the world, and wit ye well that the knights of his
blood are noble men, and dread shame; and as for Bleoberis, brother to
Sir Blamor, I have done battle with him, therefore upon my head it is no
shame to call him a good knight.’</p>
<p>‘It is noised,’ said the king, ‘that Blamor is the hardier
knight.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, as for that let him be, he shall never be refused, and as he
were the best knight that now beareth shield or spear.’</p>
<p>So King Agwisance departed unto King Carados and the kings that were
that time as judges, and told them that he had found his champion ready.
Then by the commandments of the kings Sir Blamor de Ganis and Sir
Tristram were sent for to hear the charge. And when they were come
before the judges there were many kings and knights beheld Sir Tristram,
and much speech they had of him because he slew Sir Marhaus, the good
knight, and because he forjousted Sir Palomides the good knight. So when
they had taken their charge they withdrew them to make them ready to do
battle.</p>
<p>Then said Sir Bleoberis unto his brother, Sir Blamor, ‘Fair dear
brother, remember of what kin we be come of, and what a man is Sir
Launcelot du Lake, neither farther nor nearer but brother’s children,
and there was never none of our kin that ever was shamed in battle; and
rather suffer death, brother, than to be shamed.’</p>
<p>‘Brother,’ said Blamor, ‘have ye no doubt of me, for I shall never
shame none of my blood; howbeit I am sure that yonder knight is called a
passing good knight as of his time one of the world, yet shall I never
yield me, nor say the loth word. Well may he happen to smite me down
with his great might of chivalry, but rather shall he slay me than I
shall yield me as recreant.’</p>
<p>‘God speed you well,’ said Sir Bleoberis, ‘for ye shall find him the
mightiest knight that ever ye had ado withal, for I know him, for I have
had ado with him’</p>
<p>‘God me speed,’ said Sir Blamor de Ganis; and therewith he took his
horse at the one end of the lists, and Sir Tristram at the other end of
the lists, and so they fewtered their spears and came together as it had
been thunder; and there Sir Tristram through great might smote down Sir
Blamor and his horse to the earth.</p>
<p>Then anon Sir Blamor avoided his horse and pulled out his sword and
threw his shield afore him, and bad Sir Tristram alight, ‘For though an
horse hath failed me, I trust to God the earth will not fail me.’</p>
<p>And then Sir Tristram alit, and dressed him unto battle; and there
they lashed together strongly as rasing and tracing, foining and
dashing, many sad strokes, that the kings and knights had great wonder
that they might stand; for ever they fought like wood men, so that there
were never knights seen fight more fiercely than they did; for Sir
Blamor was so hasty he would have no rest, that all men wondered that
they had breath to stand on their feet; and all the place was bloody
that they fought in. And at the last, Sir Tristram smote Sir Blamor such
a buffet upon the helm that he there fell down upon his side, and Sir
Tristram stood and beheld him.</p>
