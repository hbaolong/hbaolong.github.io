<h4 id="chapter-23">Chapter 23</h4>
<p>How the said fenight came again the next night and was beheaded
again, and how at the feast of Pentecost all the knights that Sir Gareth
had overcome came and yielded them to King Arthur</p>
<p>Right as she promised she came; and she was not so soon in his bed
but she espied an armed knight coming toward the bed: therewithal she
warned Sir Gareth, and lightly through the good help of Dame Lyonesse he
was armed; and they hurtled together with great ire and malice all about
the hall; and there was great light as it had been the number of twenty
torches both before and behind, so that Sir Gareth strained him, so that
his old wound brast again on bleeding; but he was hot and courageous and
took no keep, but with his great force he struck down that knight, and
voided his helm, and struck off his head. Then he hew the head in an
hundred pieces. And when he had done so he took up all those pieces, and
threw them out at a window into the ditches of the castle; and by this
done he was so faint that unnethes he might stand for bleeding.</p>
<p>And by then he was almost unarmed he fell in a deadly swoon on the
floor; and then Dame Lyonesse cried so that Sir Gringamore heard; and
when he came and found Sir Gareth in that plight he made great sorrow;
and there he awaked Sir Gareth, and gave him a drink that relieved him
wonderly well; but the sorrow that Dame Lyonesse made there may no
tongue tell, for she so fared with herself as she would have died.</p>
<p>Right so came this damosel Lynet before them all, and she had fetched
all the gobbets of the head that Sir Gareth had thrown out at a window,
and there she anointed them as she had done tofore, and set them
together again.</p>
<p>‘Well, damosel Lynet,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘I have not deserved all this
despite that ye do unto me.’</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ she said, ‘I have nothing done but I will avow, and all
that I have done shall be to your worship, and to us all.’</p>
<p>And then was Sir Gareth staunched of his bleeding. But the leeches
said that there was no man that bare the life should heal him throughout
of his wound but if they healed him that caused that stroke by
enchantment.</p>
<p>So leave we Sir Gareth there with Sir Gringamore and his sisters, and
turn we unto King Arthur, that at the next feast of Pentecost held his
feast; and there came the Green Knight with fifty knights, and yielded
them all unto King Arthur. And so there came the Red Knight his brother,
and yielded him to King Arthur, and three score knights with him. Also
there came the Blue Knight, brother to them, with an hundred knights,
and yielded them unto King Arthur; and the Green Knight’s name was
Pertolepe, and the Red Knight’s name was Perimones, and the Blue
Knight’s name was Sir Persant of Inde. These three brethren told King
Arthur how they were overcome by a knight that a damosel had with her,
and called him Beaumains.</p>
<p>‘Jesu,’ said the king, ‘I marvel what knight he is, and of what
lineage he is come. He was with me a twelvemonth, and poorly and
shamefully he was fostered, and Sir Kay in scorn named him
Beaumains.’</p>
<p>So right as the king stood so talking with these three brethren,
there came Sir Launcelot du Lake, and told the king that there was come
a goodly lord with six; hundred knights with him. Then the king went out
of Caerleon, for there was the feast, and there came to him this lord,
and saluted the king in a goodly manner.</p>
<p>‘What will ye,’ said King Arthur, ‘and what is your errand?’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ he said, ‘my name is the Red Knight of the Red Launds, but my
name is Sir Ironside; and sir, wit ye well, here I am sent to you of a
knight that is called Beaumains, for he won me in plain battle hand for
hand, and so did never no knight but he, that ever had the better of me
this thirty winter; the which commanded to yield me to you at your
will.’</p>
<p>‘Ye are welcome,’ said the king, ‘for ye have been long a great foe
to me and my court, and now I trust to God I shall so entreat you that
ye shall be my friend.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, both I and these five hundred knights shall always be at your
summons to do you service as may lie in our powers.’</p>
<p>‘Jesu mercy,’ said King Arthur, ‘I am much beholding unto that knight
that hath put so his body in devoir to worship me and my court. And as
to thee, Ironside, that are called the Red Knight of the Red Launds,
thou art called a perilous knight; and if thou wilt hold of me I shall
worship thee and make thee knight of the Table Round; but then thou must
be no more a murderer.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, as to that, I have promised unto Sir Beaumains never more to
use such customs, for all the shameful customs that I used I did at the
request of a lady that I loved; and therefore I must go unto Sir
Launcelot, and unto Sir Gawain, and ask them forgiveness of the evil
will I had unto them; for all that I put to death was all only for the
love of Sir Launcelot and of Sir Gawain.’</p>
<p>‘They be here now,’ said the king, ‘afore thee, now may ye say to
them what ye will.’</p>
<p>And then he kneeled down unto Sir Launcelot, and to Sir Gawain, and
prayed them of forgiveness of his enmity that ever he had against
them.</p>
<p>devoir: endeavour.</p>
