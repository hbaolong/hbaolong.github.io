<h4 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h4>
<p>How Balin and his brother, by the counsel of Merlin, took King Rience
and brought him to King Arthur</p>
<p>Then Merlin lodged them in a wood among leaves beside the highway,
and took off the bridles of their horses and put them to grass and laid
them down to rest them till it was nigh midnight. Then Merlin bad them
rise, and make them ready, for the king was nigh them, that was stolen
away from his host with a three score horses of his best knights, and
twenty of them rode tofore to warn the Lady de Vance that the king was
coming, for that night King Rience should have lain with her.</p>
<p>‘Which is the king?’ said Balin.</p>
<p>‘Abide,’ said Merlin, ‘here in a strait way ye shall meet with him;’
and therewith he showed Balin and his brother where he rode.</p>
<p>Anon Balin and his brother met with the king, and smote him down, and
wounded him fiercely, and laid him to the ground; and there they slew on
the right hand and the left hand, and slew more than forty of his men,
and the remnant fled. Then went they again to King Rience and would have
slain him had he not yielded him unto their grace. Then said he
thus:</p>
<p>‘Knights full of prowess, slay me not, for by my life ye may win, and
by my death ye shall win nothing.’</p>
<p>Then said these two knights, ‘Ye say sooth and truth,’ and so laid
him on an horse-litter.</p>
<p>With that Merlin was vanished, and came to King Arthur aforehand, and
told him how his most enemy was taken and discomfited.</p>
<p>‘By whom?’ said King Arthur.</p>
<p>‘By two knights,’ said Merlin, ‘that would please your lordship, and
tomorrow ye shall know what knights they are.’</p>
<p>Anon after came the Knight with the Two Swords and Balan his brother,
and brought with them King Rience of North Wales, and there delivered
him to the porters, and charged them with him; and so they two returned
again in the dawning of the day.</p>
<p>King Arthur came then to King Rience, and said, ‘Sir king, ye are
welcome. By what adventure come ye hither?’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said King Rience, ‘I came hither by an hard adventure.’</p>
<p>‘Who won you?’ said King Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the king, ‘the Knight with the Two Swords and his
brother, which are two marvellous knights of prowess.’</p>
<p>‘I know them not,’ said Arthur, ‘but much I am beholden to them.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said Merlin, ‘I shall tell you: it is Balin that achieved the
sword, and his brother Balan, a good knight, there liveth not a better
of prowess and of worthiness, and it shall be the greatest dole of him
that ever I knew of knight, for he shall not long endure.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said King Arthur, ‘that is great pity; for I am much
beholding unto him, and I have ill deserved it unto him for his
kindness.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Merlin, ‘He shall do much more for you, and that shall ye
know in haste. But, sir, are ye purveyed?’ said Merlin, ‘for to-morn the
host of Nero, King Rience’s brother, will set on you or noon with a
great host, and therefore make you ready, for I will depart from
you.’</p>
<p>strait: narrow.</p>
