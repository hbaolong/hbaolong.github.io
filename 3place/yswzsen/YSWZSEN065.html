<h4 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h4>
<p>How King Arthur had ado with them and overthrew them, and slew the
five kings and made the remnant to flee</p>
<p>Unto this counsel these five kings assented, and so they passed forth
with their host through North Wales, and came upon Arthur by night, and
set upon his host as the king and his knights were in their pavilions.
King Arthur was unarmed, and had lain him to rest with his Queen
Guenever.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Kay, ‘it is not good we be unarmed.’</p>
<p>‘We shall have no need,’ said Sir Gawain and Sir Griflet, that lay in
a little pavilion by the king.</p>
<p>With that they heard a great noise, and many cried, ‘Treason,
treason!’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said King Arthur, ‘we be betrayed! Unto arms, fellows,’ then
he cried. So they were armed anon at all points.</p>
<p>Then came there a wounded knight unto the king, and said, ‘Sir, save
yourself and my lady the queen, for our host is destroyed, and much
people of ours slain.’</p>
<p>So anon the king and the queen and the three knights took their
horses, and rode toward Humber to pass over it, and the water was so
rough that they were afraid to pass over.</p>
<p>‘Now may ye choose,’ said King Arthur, ‘whether ye will abide and
take the adventure on this side, for and ye be taken they will slay
you.’</p>
<p>‘It were me lever,’ said the queen, ‘to die in the water than to fall
in your enemies’ hands and there be slain.’</p>
<p>And as they stood so talking, Sir Kay saw the five kings coming on
horseback by themself alone, with their spears in their hands even
toward them.</p>
<p>‘Lo,’ said Sir Kay, ‘yonder be the five kings; let us go to them and
match them.’</p>
<p>‘That were folly,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘for we are but three and they be
five.’</p>
<p>‘That is truth,’ said Sir Griflet.</p>
<p>‘No force,’ said Sir Kay, ‘I will undertake two of them, and then may
ye three undertake for the other three.’</p>
<p>And therewithal, Sir Kay let his horse run as fast as he might, and
struck one of them through the shield and the body a fathom, that the
king fell to the earth stark dead. That saw Sir Gawain and ran unto
another king so hard that he smote him through the body. And therewithal
King Arthur ran to another, and smote him through the body with a spear,
that he fell to the earth dead. Then Sir Griflet ran unto the fourth
king, and gave him such a fall that his neck brake. Anon Sir Kay ran
unto the fifth king, and smote him so hard on the helm that the stroke
clave the helm and the head to the earth.</p>
<p>‘That was well stricken,’ said King Arthur, ‘and worshipfully hast
thou hold thy promise; therefore I shall honour thee while that I live.’
And therewithal they set the queen in a barge into Humber; but always
Queen Guenever praised Sir Kay for his deeds, and said, ‘What lady that
ye love, and she love you not again she were greatly to blame; and among
ladies,’ said the queen, ‘I shall bear your noble fame, for ye spake a
great word, and fulfilled it worshipfully.’ And therewith the queen
departed.</p>
<p>Then the king and the three knights rode into the forest, for there
they supposed to hear of them that were escaped; and there he found the
most part of his people, and told them all how the five kings were dead.
‘And therefore let us hold us together till it be day, and when their
host have espied that their chieftains be slain, they will make such
dole that they shall not more help themself.’</p>
<p>And right so as the king said, so it was; for when they found the
five kings dead, they made such dole that they fell from their horses.
Therewithal came King Arthur but with a few people, and slew on the left
hand and on the right hand, that well-nigh there escaped no man, but all
were slain to the number of thirty thousand. And when the battle was all
ended, the king kneeled down and thanked God meekly. And then he sent
for the queen, and soon she was come, and she made great joy of the
overcoming of that battle.</p>
<p>slay down: destroy completely.</p>
