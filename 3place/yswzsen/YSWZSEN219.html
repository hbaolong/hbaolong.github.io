<h4 id="chapter-23">Chapter 23</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan came to a lodging where they must
joust with two knights</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode forth their way till they came
to the shepherds and to the herdmen, and there they asked them if they
knew any lodging or harbour there nigh hand.</p>
<p>‘Forsooth, sirs,’ said the herdmen, ‘hereby is good lodging in a
castle; but there is such a custom that there shall no knight be
harboured but if he joust with two knights, and if he be but one knight
he must joust with two. And as ye be therein soon shall ye be
matched.’</p>
<p>‘There is shrewd harbour,’ said Sir Dinadan; ‘lodge where ye will,
for I will not lodge there.’</p>
<p>‘Fie for shame,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘are ye not a knight of the Table
Round? Wherefore ye may not with your worship refuse your lodging.’</p>
<p>‘Not so,’ said the herdmen, ‘for and ye be beaten and have the worse
ye shall not be lodged there, and if ye beat them ye shall be well
harboured.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said Sir Dinadan, ‘they are two sure knights.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Dinadan would not lodge there in no manner but as Sir
Tristram required him of his knighthood; and so they rode thither. And
to make short tale, Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan smote them down both,
and so they entered into the castle and had good cheer as they could
think or devise.</p>
<p>And when they were unarmed, and thought to be merry and in good rest,
there came in at the gates Sir Palomides and Sir Gaheris, requiring to
have the custom of the castle.</p>
<p>‘What array is this?’ said Sir Dinadan, ‘I would have my rest.’</p>
<p>‘That may not be,’ said Sir Tristram. ‘Now must we needs defend the
custom of this castle, insomuch as we have the better of the lords of
this castle, and therefore,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘needs must ye make you
ready.’</p>
<p>‘In the devil’s name,’ said Sir Dinadan, ‘came I unto your
company.’</p>
<p>And so they made them ready; and Sir Gaheris encountered with Sir
Tristram, and Sir Gaheris had a fall; and Sir Palomides encountered with
Sir Dinadan, and Sir Dinadan had a fall: then was it fall for fall. So
then must they fight on foot. That would not Sir Dinadan, for he was so
sore bruised of the fall that Sir Palomides gave him. Then Sir Tristram
unlaced Sir Dinadan’s helm, and prayed him to help him.</p>
<p>‘I will not,’ said Sir Dinadan, ‘for I am sore wounded of the thirty
knights that we had but late ago to do withal. But ye fare,’ said Sir
Dinadan unto Sir Tristram, ‘as a madman and as a man that is out of his
mind that would cast himself away, and I may curse the time that ever I
saw you, for in all the world are not two such knights that be so wood
as is Sir Launcelot and ye Sir Tristram; for once I fell in the
fellowship of Sir Launcelot as I have done now with you, and he set me a
work that a quarter of a year I kept my bed. Jesu defend me,’ said Sir
Dinadan, ‘from such two knights, and specially from your
fellowship.’</p>
<p>‘Then,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I will fight with them both.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram bad them come forth both, ‘for I will fight with
you.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Palomides and Sir Gaheris dressed them, and smote at them
both. Then Dinadan smote at Sir Gaheris a stroke or two, and turned from
him.</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Palomides, ‘it is too much shame for us two knights
to fight with one.’</p>
<p>And then he did bid Sir Gaheris stand aside with that knight that
hath no list to fight. Then they rode together and fought long, and at
the last Sir Tristram doubled his strokes, and drove Sir Palomides aback
more than three strides. And then by one assent Sir Gaheris and Sir
Dinadan went betwixt them, and departed them in sunder.</p>
<p>And then by assent of Sir Tristram they would have lodged together.
But Sir Dinadan would not lodge in that castle. And then he cursed the
time that ever he came in their fellowship, and so he took his horse,
and his harness, and departed.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram prayed the lords of that castle to lend him a man
to bring him to a lodging, and so they did, and overtook Sir Dinadan,
and rode to their lodging two mile thence with a good man in a priory,
and there they were well at ease.</p>
<p>And that same night Sir Bors and Sir Bleoberis, and Sir Ector and Sir
Driant, abode still in the same place thereas Sir Tristram fought with
the thirty knights; and there they met with Sir Launcelot the same
night, and had made promise to lodge with Sir Colgrevaunce the same
night.</p>
