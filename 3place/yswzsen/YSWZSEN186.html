<h4 id="chapter-31">Chapter 31</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram rode after Palomides, and how he found him and
fought with him, and by the mean of Isoud the battle ceased</p>
<p>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram, that when he was come home and wist La
Beale Isoud was gone with Sir Palomides, wit ye well he was wroth out of
measure.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I am this day shamed.’ Then he cried to
Gouvernail his man, ‘Haste thee that I were armed and on horseback, for
well I wot Lambegus hath no might nor strength to withstand Sir
Palomides; alas that I have not been in his stead!’</p>
<p>So anon as he was armed and horsed Sir Tristram and Gouvernail rode
after into the forest, and within a while he found his knight Lambegus
almost wounded to the death; and Sir Tristram bare him to a forester,
and charged him to keep him well.</p>
<p>And then he rode forth, and there he found Sir Adtherp sore wounded,
and he told him how the queen would have drowned herself had he not
been, and how for her sake and love he had taken upon him to do battle
with Sir Palomides.</p>
<p>‘Where is my lady?’ said Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the knight, ‘she is sure enough within my castle, and she
can hold her within it.’</p>
<p>‘Gramercy,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘of thy great goodness.’</p>
<p>And so he rode till he came nigh to that castle; and then Sir
Tristram saw where Sir Palomides sat at the gate sleeping, and his horse
pastured fast afore him.</p>
<p>‘Now go thou, Gouvernail,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘and bid him awake, and
make him ready.’</p>
<p>So Gouvernail rode unto him and said, ‘Sir Palomides, arise, and take
to thee thine harness.’</p>
<p>But he was in such a study he heard not what Gouvernail said. So
Gouvernail came again and told Sir Tristram he slept, or else he was
mad.</p>
<p>‘Go thou again,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘and bid him arise, and tell him
that I am here, his mortal foe.’</p>
<p>So Gouvernail rode again and put upon him the butt of his spear, and
said, ‘Sir Palomides, make thee ready, for wit ye well Sir Tristram
hoveth yonder, and sendeth thee word he is thy mortal foe.’</p>
<p>And therewithal Sir Palomides arose stilly, without words, and gat
his horse, and saddled him and bridled him, and lightly he leapt upon,
and gat his spear in his hand, and either fewtered their spears and
hurtled fast together; and there Tristram smote down Sir Palomides over
his horse’s tail. Then lightly Sir Palomides put his shield afore him
and drew his sword.</p>
<p>And there began strong battle on both parts, for both they fought for
the love of one lady, and ever she lay on the walls and beheld them how
they fought out of measure, and either were wounded passing sore, but
Palomides was much sorer wounded. Thus they fought tracing and
traversing more than two hours, that well-nigh for dole and sorrow La
Beale Isoud swooned.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ she said ‘that one I loved and yet do, and the other I love
not, yet it were great pity that I should see Sir Palomides slain; for
well I know by that time the end be done Sir Palomides is but a dead
knight; because he is not christened I would be loth that he should die
a Saracen.’</p>
<p>And therewithal she came down and besought Sir Tristram to fight no
more.</p>
<p>‘Ah, madam,’ said he, ‘what mean you, will ye have me shamed? Well ye
know I will be ruled by you.’</p>
<p>‘I will not your dishonour,’ said La Beale Isoud, ‘but I would that
ye would for my sake spare this unhappy Saracen, Palomides.’</p>
<p>‘Madam,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I will leave fighting at this time for
your sake.’</p>
<p>Then she said to Sir Palomides, ‘This shall be your charge, that thou
shalt go out of this country while I am therein.’</p>
<p>‘I will obey your commandment,’ said Sir Palomides, ‘the which is
sore against my will.’</p>
<p>‘Then take thy way,’ said La Beale Isoud, ‘unto the court of King
Arthur, and there recommend me unto Queen Guenever, and tell her that I
send her word that there be within this land but four lovers, that is,
Sir Launcelot du Lake and Queen Guenever, and Sir Tristram de Liones and
Queen Isoud.’</p>
