<h4 id="chapter-26">Chapter 26</h4>
<p>How King Arthur sent for the Lady Lyonesse, and how she let cry a
tourney at her castle, whereas came many knights</p>
<p>Then said Sir Gawain and his brethren unto Arthur, ‘Sir, and ye will
give us leave, we will go and seek our brother.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘that shall ye not need!’ and so said Sir
Batedwin of Britain: ‘for as by our advice the king shall send unto Dame
Lyonesse a messenger, and pray her that she will come to the court in
all the haste that she may, and doubt ye not she will come; and then she
may give you best counsel where ye shall find him.’</p>
<p>‘This is well said of you,’ said the king.</p>
<p>So then goodly letters were made, and the messenger sent forth, that
night and day he went till he came unto the Castle Perilous. And then
the lady Dame Lyonesse was sent for there as she was with Sir Gringamore
her brother and Sir Gareth. And when she understood this message, she
bad him ride on his way unto King Arthur, and she would come after in
all goodly haste.</p>
<p>Then when she came to Sir Gringamore and to Sir Gareth, she told them
all how King Athur had sent for her.</p>
<p>‘That is because of me,’ said Sir Gareth.</p>
<p>‘Now advise me,’ said Dame Lyonesse, ‘what shall I say, and in what
manner I shall rule me.’</p>
<p>‘My lady and my love,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘I pray you in no wise be ye
aknown where I am. But well I wot my mother is there and all my
brethren, and they will take upon them to seek me, I wot well that they
do. But this, madam, I would ye said and advised the king when he
questioned with you of me. Then may ye say, this is your advice that,
and it like his good grace, ye will do make a cry against the feast of
the Assumption of Our Lady, that what knight there proveth him best he
shall wield you and all your land. And if so be that he be a wedded man,
that his wife shall the degree, and a coronal of gold beset with stones
of virtue to the value of a thousand pound,1 and a white gerfalcon.’</p>
<p>So Dame Lyonesse departed and came to King Arthur, where she was
nobly received, and there she was sore questioned of the king and of the
Queen of Orkney. And she answered, where Sir Gareth was she could not
tell. But thus much she said unto Arthur:</p>
<p>‘Sir, I will let cry a tournament that shall be done before my castle
at the Assumption of Our Lady, and the cry shall be this: that you, my
lord Arthur, shall be there, and your knights, and I will purvey that my
knights shall be against yours; and then I am sure ye shall hear of Sir
Gareth.’</p>
<p>‘This is well advised,’ said King Arthur.</p>
<p>And so she departed. And the king and she made great provision to
that tournament.</p>
<p>When Dame Lyonesse was come to the Isle of Avilion, that was the same
isle thereas her brother Sir Gringamore dwelt, then she told them all
how she had done, and what promise she had made to King Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘I have been so wounded with un-happiness
sithen I came into this castle that I shall not be able to do at that
tournament like a knight; for I was never thoroughly whole since I was
hurt.’</p>
<p>‘Be ye of good cheer,’ said the damosel Lynet, ‘for I undertake
within these fifteen days to make ye whole, and as lusty as ever ye
were.’</p>
<p>And then she laid an ointment and a salve to him as it pleased to
her, that he was never so fresh nor so lusty.</p>
<p>Then said the damosel Lynet, ‘Send you unto Sir Persant of Inde, and
assummon him and his knights to be here with you as they have promised.
Also, that ye send unto Sir Ironside, that is the Red Knight of the Red
Launds, and charge him that he be ready with you with his whole sum of
knights, and then shall ye be able to match with King Arthur and his
knights.’</p>
<p>So this was done, and all knights were sent for unto the Castle
Perilous; and then the Red Knight answered and said unto Dame Lyonesse,
and to Sir Gareth,</p>
<p>‘Madam, and my lord Sir Gareth, ye shall understand that I have been
at the court of King Arthur, and Sir Persant of Inde and his brethren,
and there we have done our homage as ye commanded us. Also,’ Sir
Ironside said, ‘I have taken upon me with Sir Persant of Inde and his
brethen to hold part against my lord Sir Launcelot and the knights of
that court. And this have I done for the love of my lady Dame Lyonesse,
and you my lord Sir Gareth.’</p>
<p>‘Ye have well done,’ said Sir Gareth; ‘but wit you well ye shall be
full sore matched with the most noble knights of the world; therefore we
must purvey us of good knights, where we may get them.’</p>
<p>‘That is well said,’ said Sir Persant, ‘and worshipfully.’</p>
<p>And so the cry was made in England, Wales, and Scotland, Ireland,
Cornwall, and in all the Out Isles, and in Brittany and in many
countries, that at the feast of Our Lady the Assumption next coming, men
should come to the Castle Perilous beside the Isle of Avilion; and there
all the knights that there came should have the choice whether them list
to be on the one party with the knights of the castle, or on the other
party with King Arthur. And two months was to the day that the
tournament should be.</p>
<p>And so there came many good knights that were at their large, and
held them for the most part against King Arthur and his knights of the
Round Table, came in the side of them of the castle. For Sir Epinogrus
was the first, and he was the King’s son of Northumberland, and Sir
Palomides the Saracen was another, and Sir Safer his brother, and Sir
Segwarides his brother, but they were christened, and Sir Malgrin
another, and Sir Brian de les Isles, a noble knight, and Sir Grummor
Grummorson, a good knight of Scotland, and Sir Carados of the Dolorous
Tower, a noble knight, and Sir Turquin his brother, and Sir Arnold and
Sir Gauter, two brethren, good knights of Cornwall. There came Sir
Tristram de Liones, and with him Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, and Sir
Sadok; but this Sir Tristram was not at that time knight of the Table
Round, but he was one of the best knights of the world.</p>
<p>And so all these noble knights accompanied them with the lady of the
castle, and with the Red Knight of the Red Launds; but as for Sir
Gareth, he would not take upon him more but as other mean knights.</p>
<p>aknown: aware. wield: possess.</p>
