<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>
<p>How a young man came into the court of King Arthur, and how Sir Kay
called him in scorn La Cote Male Taile</p>
<p>At the court of King Arthur there came a young man and bigly made,
and he was richly beseen, and he desired to be made knight of the king;
but his over-garment sat overthwartly, howbeit it was rich cloth of
gold.</p>
<p>‘What is your name?’ said King Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said he, ‘my name is Breunor le Noire, and within short space
ye shall know that I am of good kin.’</p>
<p>‘It may well be,’ said Sir Kay, the Seneschal, ‘but in mockage ye
shall be called La Cote Male Taile, that is as much to say, the
evil-shapen coat.’</p>
<p>‘It is a great thing that thou askest,’ said the king. ‘And for what
cause wearest thou that rich coat? Tell me, for I can well think for
some cause it is.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ he answered, ‘I had a father, a noble knight, and as he rode
on hunting, upon a day it happed him to lay him down to sleep; and there
came a knight that had been long his enemy, and when he saw he was fast
asleep he all to-hew him; and this same coat had my father on the same
time; and that maketh this coat to sit so evil upon me, for the strokes
be on it as I found it, and never shall be amended for me. Thus to have
my father’s death in remembrance I wear this coat till I be revenged;
and because ye are called the most noblest king of the world I come to
you that ye should make me knight.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Lamorak and Sir Gaheris, ‘it were well done to make
him knight; for him beseemeth well of person and of countenance, that he
shall prove a good man, and a good knight, and a mighty; for, sir, and
ye be remembered, even such one was Sir Launcelot du Lake when he came
first into this court, and full few of us knew from whence he came; and
now is he proved the man of most worship in the world, and all your
court and all your Round Table is by Sir Launcelot worshipped and
amended more than by any knight now living.’</p>
<p>‘That is truth,’ said the king, ‘and tomorrow at your request I shall
make him knight.’</p>
<p>So on the morrow there was an hart founden, and thither rode King
Arthur with a company of his knights to slay the hart. And this young
man that Sir Kay named La Cote Male Taile was there left behind with
Queen Guenever; and by sudden adventure there was an horrible lion kept
in a strong tower of stone, and it happened that he at that time brake
loose, and came hurling afore the queen and her knights. And when the
queen saw the lion she cried and fled, and prayed her knights to rescue
her. And there was none of them all but twelve that abode, and all the
other fled.</p>
<p>Then said La Cote Male Taile, ‘Now I see well that all coward knights
be not dead;’ and therewithal he drew his sword and dressed him afore
the lion.</p>
<p>And that lion gaped wide and came upon him ramping to have slain him.
And he then smote him in the midst of the head such a mighty stroke that
it clave his head in sunder, and dashed to the earth.</p>
<p>Then was it told the queen how the young man that Sir Kay named by
scorn La Cote Male Taile had slain the lion.</p>
<p>With that the king came home, and when the queen told him of that
adventure, he was well pleased, and said, ‘Upon pain of mine head he
shall prove a noble man and a faithful knight, and true of his promise.’
Then the king forthwithal made him knight.</p>
<p>‘Now sir,’ said this young knight, ‘I require you and all the knights
of your court, that ye call me by none other name but La Cote Male
Taile: in so much that Sir Kay hath so named me so will I be
called.’</p>
<p>‘I assent me well thereto,’ said the king.</p>
