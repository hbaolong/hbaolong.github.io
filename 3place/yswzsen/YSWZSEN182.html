<h4 id="chapter-27">Chapter 27</h4>
<p>How Sir Galahaut fought with Sir Tristram, and how Sir Tristram
yielded him and promised to fellowship with Launcelot</p>
<p>Then came Sir Galahaut, and the King with the Hundred Knights with
him; and this Sir Galahaut proffered to fight with Sir Tristram hand for
hand. And so they made them ready to go unto battle on horseback with
great courage.</p>
<p>Then Sir Galahaut and Sir Tristram met together so hard that either
bare other down, horse and all, to the earth. And then they avoided
their horses as noble knights, and dressed their shields, and drew their
swords with ire and rancour, and they lashed together many sad strokes,
and one while striking, another while foining, tracing and traversing as
noble knights: thus they fought long, near half a day, and either were
sore wounded.</p>
<p>At the last Sir Tristram waxed light and big, and doubled his
strokes, and drove Sir Galahaut aback on the one side and on the other,
so that he was like to have been slain. With that came the King with the
Hundred Knights, and all that fellowship went fiercely upon Sir
Tristram. When Sir Tristram saw them coming upon him, then he wist well
he might not endure. Then as a wise knight of war, he said to Sir
Galahaut, the Haut Prince,</p>
<p>‘Sir, ye show to me no knighthood, for to suffer all your men to have
ado with me all at once; and as meesemeth ye be a noble knight of your
hands it is great shame to you.’</p>
<p>‘So God me help,’ said Sir Galahaut, ‘there is none other way but
thou must yield thee to me, other else to die,’ said Sir Galahaut to Sir
Tristram.</p>
<p>‘I will rather yield me to you than die, for that is more for the
might of your men than of your hands.’ And therewithal Sir Tristram took
his own sword by the point, and put the pommel in the hand of Sir
Galahaut.</p>
<p>Therewithal came the King with the Hundred Knights, and hard began to
assail Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>‘Let be,’ said Sir Galahaut, ‘be ye not so hardy to touch him, for I
have given this knight his life.’</p>
<p>‘That is your shame,’ said the King with the Hundred Knights; ‘hath
he not slain your father and your mother?’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said Sir Galahaut, ‘I may not wit him greatly, for my
father had him in prison, and inforced him to do battle with him; and my
father had such a custom that was a shameful custom, that what knight
came there to ask harbour his lady must needs die but if she were fairer
than my mother; and if my father overcame that knight he must needs die.
This was a shameful custom and usage, a knight for his harbour asking to
have such harbourage. And for this custom I would never draw about
him.’</p>
<p>‘So God me help,’ said the king, ‘this was a shameful custom.’</p>
<p>‘Truly,’ said Sir Galahaut, ‘so seemed me; and meseemed it had been
great pity that this knight should have been slain, for I dare say he is
the noblest man that beareth life, but if it were Sir Launcelot du Lake.
Now, fair knight,’ said Sir Galahaut, ‘I require thee tell me thy name,
and of whence thou art, and whither thou wilt.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ he said, ‘my name is Tristram de Liones, and from King Mark of
Cornwall I was sent on message unto King Agwisance of Ireland, for to
fetch his daughter to be his wife, and here she is ready to go with me
into Cornwall, and her name is La Beale Isoud.’</p>
<p>‘And, Sir Tristram,’ said Sir Galahaut, the Haut Prince, ‘Well be ye
found in these marches, and so ye will promise me to go unto Sir
Launcelot du Lake, and accompany with him, ye shall go where ye will,
and your fair lady with you; and I shall promise you never in all my
days shall such customs be used in this castle as have been used.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘now I let you wit, so God me help, I
weened ye had been Sir Launcelot du Lake when I saw you first, and
therefore I dread you the more; and sir, I promise you,’ said Sir
Tristram, ‘as soon as I may I will see Sir Launcelot and infellowship me
with him; for of all the knights of the world I most desire his
fellowship.’</p>
