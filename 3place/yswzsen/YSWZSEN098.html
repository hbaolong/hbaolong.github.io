<h4 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h4>
<p>How a senator told to Lucius of their discomfiture, and also of the
great battle between Arthur and Lucius</p>
<p>Now leave we King Arthur and his noble knights which had won the
field, and had brought their prisoners to Paris, and speak we of a
senator which escaped from the battle, and came to Lucius the emperor,
and said to him,</p>
<p>‘Sir emperor, I advise thee for to withdraw thee. What dost thou
here? Thou shalt win nothing in these marches but great strokes out of
all measure, for this day one of Arthur’s knights was worth in the
battle an hundred of ours.’</p>
<p>‘Fie on thee’ said Lucius, ‘thou speakest cowardly; for thy words
grieve me more than all the loss that I had this day.’ And anon he sent
forth a king, which hight Sir Leomie, with a great army, and bad him hie
him fast tofore, and he would follow hastily after.</p>
<p>King Arthur was warned privily, and sent his people to Sessoine, and
took up the towns and castles from the Romans. Then the king commanded
Sir Cador to take the rearward, and to take with him certain knights of
the Round Table, ‘And Sir Launcelot, Sir Bors, Sir Kay, Sir Marrok, with
Sir Marhaus, shall await on our person.’ Thus the King Arthur disperpled
his host in divers parties, to the end that his enemies should not
escape.</p>
<p>When the emperor was entered into the vale of Sessoine, he might see
where King Arthur was embattled and his banner displayed; and he was
beset round about with his enemies, that needs he must fight or yield
him, for he might not flee, but said openly unto the Romans, ‘Sirs, I
admonish you that this day ye fight and acquit you as men, and remember
how Rome domineth and is chief and head over all the earth and universal
world, and suffer not these Britons this day to abide against us;’ and
therewith he did command his trumpets to blow the bloody sounds, in such
wise that the ground trembled and dindled.</p>
<p>Then the battles approached and shove and shouted on both sides, and
great strokes were smitten on both sides, many men overthrown, hurt, and
slain; and great valiances, prowesses and appertices of war were that
day showed, which were over long to recount the noble feats of every
man, for they should contain an whole volume. But in especial, King
Arthur rode in the battle exhorting his knights to do well, and himself
did as nobly with his hands as was possible a man to do; he drew out
Excalibur his sword, and awaited ever whereas the Romans were thickest
and most grieved his people, and anon he addressed him on that part, and
hew and slew down right, and rescued his people; and he slew a great
giant named Galapas, which was a man of an huge quantity and height; he
shorted him and smote off both his legs by the knees, saying, ‘Now art
thou better of a size to deal with than thou were,’ and after smote off
his head. There Sir Gawain fought nobly and slew three admirals in that
battle. And so did all the knights of the Round Table.</p>
<p>Thus the battle between King Arthur and Lucius the Emperor endured
long. Lucius had on his side many Saracens which were slain. And thus
the battle was great, and oftsides that one party was at a fordeal and
anon at an afterdeal, which endured so long till at the last King Arthur
espied where Lucius the Emperor fought, and did wonder with his own
hands.</p>
<p>And anon he rode to him. And either smote other fiercely, and at last
Lucius smote Arthur thwart the visage, and gave him a large wound. And
when King Arthur felt himself hurt, anon he smote him again with
Excalibur that it cleft his head, from the summit of his head, and
stinted not till it came to his breast. And then the emperor fell down
dead and there ended his life. And when it was known that the emperor
was slain, anon all the Romans with all their host put them to flight,
and King Arthur with all his knights followed the chase, and slew down
right all them that they might attain.</p>
<p>And thus was the victory given to King Arthur, and the triumph; and
there were slain on the party of Lucius more than a hundred thousand.
And after King Arthur did do ransack the dead bodies, and did do bury
them that were slain of his retinue, every man according to the estate
and degree that he was of. And them that were hurt he let the surgeons
do search their hurts and wounds, and commanded to spare no salves ne
medicines till they were whole.</p>
<p>Then the king rode straight to the place where the Emperor Lucius lay
dead, and with him he found slain the Sultan of Syria, the King of Egypt
and of Ethiopia, which were two noble kings, with seventeen other kings
of divers regions, and also sixty senators of Rome, all noble men, whom
the king did do blam and gum with many good gums aromatic, and after did
do cere them in sixty fold of cered cloth of sendal, and laid them in
chests of lead, because they should not chafe ne savour, and upon all
these bodies their shields with their arms and banners were set, to the
end they should be known of what country they were.</p>
<p>And after he found three senators which were alive, to whom he said,
‘For to save your lives I will that ye take these dead bodies, and carry
them with you unto great Rome, and present them to the Potestate on my
behalf, showing him my letters, and tell them that I in my person shall
hastily be at Rome. And I suppose the Romans shall beware how they shall
demand any tribute of me. And I command you to say when ye shall come to
Rome, to the Potestate and all the Council and Senate, that I send to
them these dead bodies for the tribute that they have demanded. And if
they be not content with these, I shall pay more at my coming, for other
tribute owe I none, ne none other will I pay. And methinketh this
sufficeth for Britain, Ireland and all Almain with Germany. And
furthermore, I charge you to say to them, that I command them upon pain
of their heads never to demand tribute ne tax of me ne of my lands.’</p>
<p>Then with this charge and commandment, the three senators aforesaid
departed with all the said dead bodies, laying the body of Lucius in a
car covered with the arms of the Empire all alone; and after alway two
bodies of kings in a chariot, and then the bodies of the senators after
them, and so went toward Rome, and showed their legation and message to
the Potestate and Senate, recounting the battle done in France, and how
the field was lost and much people and innumerable slain. Wherefore they
advised them in no wise to move no more war against that noble conqueror
Arthur, ‘for his might and prowess is most to be doubted, seeing the
noble kings and great multitude of knights of the Round Table, to whom
none earthly prince may compare.’</p>
