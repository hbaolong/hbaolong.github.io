<h4 id="chapter-27">Chapter 27</h4>
<p>How King Arthur went to the tournament with his knights, and how the
lady received him worship-fully, and how the knights encountered</p>
<p>And then there came with King Arthur Sir Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris,
his brethren. And then his nephews Sir Uwain le Blanchemains, and Sir
Agloval, Sir Tor, Sir Percival de Gales, and Sir Lamorak de Gales.</p>
<p>Then came Sir Launcelot du Lake with his brethren, nephews, and
cousins, as Sir Lionel, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de Ganis, and Sir
Galihodin, Sir Galihud, and many more of Sir Launcelot’s blood, and Sir
Dinadan, Sir La Cote Male Taile, his brother, a good knight, and Sir
Sagramore, a good knight; and all the most part of the Round Table.</p>
<p>Also there came with King Arthur these knights: the King of Ireland,
King Agwisance, and the King of Scotland, King Carados and King Uriens
of the land of Gore, and King Bagdemagus and his son Sir Meliagaunt, and
Sir Galahaut the noble prince. All these kings, princes, and earls,
barons, and other noble knights, as Sir Brandiles, Sir Uwain les
Avoutres, and Sir Kay, Sir Bedevere, Sir Meliot de Logris, Sir Fetipace
of Winchelsea, Sir Godelake: all these came with King Arthur, and more
that cannot be rehearsed.</p>
<p>Now leave we of these kings and knights, and let us speak of the
great array that was made within the castle and about the castle for
both parties. The lady Dame Lyonesse ordained great array upon her part
for her noble knights, for all manner of lodging and victual that came
by land and by water, that there lacked nothing for her party, nor for
the other, but there was plenty to be had for gold and silver for King
Arthur and his knights. And then there came the harbingers from King
Arthur for to harbour him, and his kings, dukes, earls, barons, and
knights.</p>
<p>And then Sir Gareth prayed Dame Lyonesse and the Red Knight of the
Red Launds, and Sir Persant and his brother, and Sir Gringamore, that in
no wise there should none of them tell not his name, and make no more of
him than of the least knight that there was, ‘for,’ he said, ‘I will not
be known of neither more ne less, neither at the beginning neither at
the ending.’</p>
<p>Then Dame Lyonesse said unto Sir Gareth, ‘Sir, I will lend you a
ring, but I would pray you as you love me heartily let me have it again
when the tournament is done, for that ring increaseeth my beauty much
more than it is of himself.1 And the virtue of my ring is that, that is
green it will turn to red, and that is red it will turn in likeness to
green, and that is blue it will turn to likeness of white, and that is
white it will turn in likeness to blue, and so it will do of all manner
of colours. Also who that beareth my ring shall lose no blood, and for
great love I will give you this ring.’</p>
<p>‘Gramercy,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘mine own lady, for this ring is passing
meet for me, for it will turn all manner of likeness that I am in, and
that shall cause me that I shall not be known.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Gringamore gave Sir Gareth a bay courser that was a passing
good horse; also he gave him good armour and sure, and a noble sword
that sometime Sir Gringamore’s father won upon an heathen tyrant. And so
thus every knight made him ready to that tournament.</p>
<p>And King Arthur was comen two days tofore the Assumption of Our Lady.
And there was all manner of royalty of all minstrelsy that might be
found. Also there came Queen Guenever and the Queen of Orkney, Sir
Gareth’s mother. And upon the Assumption Day, when mass and matins were
done, there were heralds with trumpets commanded to blow to the
field.</p>
<p>And so there came out Sir Epinogrus, the King’s son of
Northumberland, from the castle, and there encountered with him Sir
Sagramore le Desirous, and either of them brake their spears to their
hands. And then came in Sir Palomides out of the castle, and there
encountered with him Gawain, and either of them smote other so hard that
both the good knights and their horses fell to the earth. And then
knights of either party rescued their knights. And then came in Sir
Safer and Sir Segwarides, brethren to Sir Palomides; and there
encountered Sir Agravain with Sir Safer and Sir Gaheris encountered with
Sir Segwarides. So Sir Safer smote down Agravain, Sir Gawain’s brother;
and Sir Segwarides, Sir Safer’s brother. And Sir Malgrin, a knight of
the castle, encountered with Sir Uwain le Blanchemains, and there Sir
Uwain gave Sir Malgrin a fall, that he had almost broke his neck.</p>
