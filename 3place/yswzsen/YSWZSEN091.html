<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>
<p>How twelve aged ambassadors of Rome came to King Arthur to demand
truage for Britain</p>
<p>When King Arthur had after long war rested, and held a royal feast
and Table Round with his allies of kings, princes, and noble knights all
of the Round Table, there came into his hall, he sitting on his throne
royal, twelve ancient men, bearing each of them a branch of olive, in
token that they came as ambassadors and messengers from the Emperor
Lucius, which was called at that time, Dictator or Procuror of the
Public Weal of Rome; which said messengers, after their entering and
coming into the presence of King Arthur, did to him their obeisance in
making to him reverence, said to him in this wise:</p>
<p>‘The high and mighty Emperor Lucius sendeth to the King of Britain
greeting, commanding thee to acknowledge him for thy lord, and to send
him the truage due of this realm unto the Empire, which thy father and
other tofore thy precessors have paid as is of record, and thou as rebel
not knowing him as thy sovereign, withholdest and retainest contrary to
the statutes and decrees made by the noble and worthy Julius Cesar,
conqueror of this realm, and first Emperor of Rome. And if thou refuse
his demand and commandment, know thou for certain that he shall make
strong war against thee, thy realms and lands, and shall chastise thee
and thy subjects, that it shall be example perpetual unto all kings and
princes, for to deny their truage unto that noble empire which domineth
upon the universal world.’</p>
<p>Then when they had showed the effect of their message, the king
commanded them to withdraw them, and said he should take advice of
council and give to them an answer. Then some of the young knights,
hearing this their message, would have run on them to have slain them,
saying that it was a rebuke to all the knights there being present to
suffer them to say so to the king. And anon the king commanded that none
of them, upon pain of death, to missay them ne do them any harm, and
commanded a knight to bring them to their lodging; ‘and see that they
have all that is necessary and requisite for them, with the best cheer,
and that no dainty be spared, for the Romans be great lords, and though
their message please me not nor my court, yet I must remember mine
honour.’</p>
<p>After this the king let call all his lords and knights of the Round
Table to counsel upon this matter, and desired them to say their
advice.</p>
<p>Then Sir Cador of Cornwall spake first and said, ‘Sir, this message
liketh me well, for we have many days rested us and have been idle, and
now I hope ye shall make sharp war on the Romans, where I doubt not we
shall get honour.’</p>
<p>‘I believe well’ said Arthur, ‘that this matter pleaseth thee well,
but these answers may not be answered, for the demand grieveth me sore,
for truly I will never pay truage to Rome, wherefore I pray you to
counsel me. I have understand that Belinus and Brenius, kings of
Britain, have had the empire in their hands many days, and also
Constantine the son of Heleine, which is an open evidence that we owe no
tribute to Rome, but of right we that be descended of them have right to
claim the title of the empire.’</p>
<p>domineth: holds sway.</p>
