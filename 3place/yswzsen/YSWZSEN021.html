<h4 id="chapter-20">Chapter 20</h4>
<p>How King Pellinor took Arthur’s horse and followed the Questing
Beast, and how Merlin met with Arthur</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ said the king ‘leave that quest and suffer me to have
it, and I will follow it another twelvemonth.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, fool,’ said the knight unto Arthur, ‘it is in vain thy desire,
for it shall never be achieved but by me, or my next kin,’ Therewith he
start unto the king’s horse and mounted into the saddle, and said,
‘Gramercy, this horse is my own.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said the king, ’thou mayst take mine horse by force, but and
I might prove thee whether thou were better on horseback or I.’1</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said the knight, ‘seek me here when thou wilt, and here nigh
this well thou shalt find me,’ and so passed on his way.</p>
<p>Then the king sat in a study, and bad his men fetch his horse as fast
as ever they might. Right so came by him Merlin like a child of fourteen
year of age, and saluted the king, and asked him why he was so
pensive.</p>
<p>‘I may well be pensive’ said the king, ‘for I have seen the
marvellest sight that ever I saw.’</p>
<p>‘That know I well,’ said Merlin, ‘as well as thyself, and of all thy
thoughts, but thou art but a fool to take thought, for it will not amend
thee. Also I know what thou art, and who was thy father, and of whom
thou were begotten; King Uther Pendragon was thy father, and begat thee
on Igraine.’</p>
<p>‘That is false’ said King Arthur, ‘How shouldest thou know it, for
thou art not so old of years to know my father?’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ said Merlin, ‘I know it better than ye or any man living.’</p>
<p>‘I will not believe thee,’ said Arthur, and was wroth with the
child.</p>
<p>So departed Merlin, and came again in the likeness of an old man of
fourscore year of age, whereof the king was right glad, for he seemed to
be right wise. Then said the old man, ‘Why are ye so sad?’</p>
<p>‘I may well be heavy,’ said Arthur, ‘for many things. Also here was a
child, and told me many things that meseemeth he should not know, for he
was not of age to know my father.’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ said the old man, ‘the child told you truth, and more would he
have told you and ye would have suffered him. But ye have done a thing
late that God is displeased with you, for ye have lain by your sister,
and on her ye have gotten a child that shall destroy you and all the
knights of your realm.’</p>
<p>‘What are ye,’ said Arthur, ‘that tell me these tidings?’</p>
<p>‘I am Merlin, and I was he in the child’s likeness.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said King Arthur, ‘ye are a marvellous man, but I marvel much
of thy words that I must die in battle.’</p>
<p>‘Marvel not,’ said Merlin, ‘for it is God’s will your body to be
punished for your foul deeds. But I may well be sorry,’ said Merlin,
‘for I shall the a shameful death to be put in the earth quick, and ye
shall die a worshipful death,’ And as they talked this, came one with
the king’s horse, and so the king mounted on his horse, and Merlin on
another, and so rode unto Caerleon.</p>
<p>And anon the king asked Ector and Ulfius how he was begotten, and
they told him Uther Pendragon was his father and Queen Igraine his
mother.2 Then he said to Merlin, ‘I will that my mother be sent for,
that I may speak with her; and if she say so herself, then will I
believe it.’</p>
<p>In all haste, the queen was sent for, and she came and brought with
her Morgan le Fay, her daughter, that was as fair a lady as any might
be, and the king welcomed Igraine in the best manner.</p>
