<h4 id="chapter-16">Chapter 16</h4>
<p>How Balin was delivered by Merlin, and saved a knight that would have
slain Himself for love</p>
<p>Then Merlin came thither and took up Balin, and gat him a good horse,
for his was dead, and bad him ride out of that country.</p>
<p>‘I would have my damosel,’ said Balin.</p>
<p>‘Lo,’ said Merlin, ‘where she lieth dead.’</p>
<p>1 And King Pellam lay so, many years sore wounded, and might never be
whole till Galahad the Haut Prince healed him in the quest of the
Sangrail, for in that place was part of the blood of Our Lord Jesus
Christ, that Joseph of Arimathea brought into this land, and there
himself lay in that rich bed. And that was the same spear that Longius
smote Our Lord to the heart. And King Pellam was nigh of Joseph’s kin,
and that was the most worshipful man that lived in those days, and great
pity it was of his hurt, for through that stroke, turned to great dole,
tray and tene.</p>
<p>Then departed Balin from Merlin, and said, ‘In this world we meet
never no more.’ So he rode forth through the fair countries and cities,
and found the people dead, slain on every side. And all that were alive
cried, ‘O Balin, thou hast caused great damage in these countries; for
the dolorous stroke thou gavest unto King Pellam, three countries are
destroyed, and doubt not but the vengeance will fall on thee at the
last.’</p>
<p>When Balin was past those countries he was passing fain. So he rode
eight days or he met with adventure. And at the last he came into a fair
forest in a valley, and was ware of a tower, and there beside he saw a
great horse of war, tied to a tree, and there beside sat a fair knight
on the ground and made great mourning, and he was a likely man, and a
well made. Balin said, ‘God save you, why be ye so heavy? Tell me and I
will amend it, and I may to my power.’</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ said he again, ‘thou doest me great grief, for I was in
merry thoughts, and now thou puttest me to more pain.’</p>
<p>Balin went a little from him, and looked on his horse; then heard
Balin him say thus: ‘Ah, fair lady, why have ye broken my promise, for
thou promisest me to meet me here by noon, and I may curse thee that
ever ye gave me this sword, for with this sword I slay myself,’ and
pulled it out. And therewith Balin start unto him and took him by the
hand.</p>
<p>‘Let go my hand,’ said the knight, ‘or else I shall slay thee.’</p>
<p>‘That shall not need,’ said Balin, ‘for I shall promise you my help
to get you your lady, and ye will tell me where she is.’</p>
<p>‘What is your name?’ said the knight.</p>
<p>‘My name is Balin le Savage.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, sir, I know you well enough, ye are the Knight with the Two
Swords, and the man of most prowess of your hands living.’</p>
<p>‘What is your name?’ said Balin.</p>
<p>‘My name is Garnish of the Mount, a poor man’s son, but by my prowess
and hardiness a duke hath made me knight, and gave me lands; his name is
Duke Hermel, and his daughter is she that I love, and she me, as I
deemed.’</p>
<p>‘How far is she hence?’ said Balin.</p>
<p>‘But six mile,’ said the knight.</p>
<p>‘Now ride we hence,’ said these two knights. So they rode more than a
pace, till that they came to a fair castle well walled and ditched.</p>
<p>‘I will into the castle,’ said Balin, ‘and look if she be there.’</p>
<p>So he went in and searched from chamber to chamber, and found her
bed, but she was not there. Then Balin looked into a fair little garden,
and under a laurel tree he saw her lie upon a quilt of green samite and
a knight in her arms, fast halsing either other, and under their heads
grass and herbs. When Balin saw her lie so with the foulest knight that
ever he saw, and she a fair lady, then Balin went through all the
chambers again, and told the knight how he found her as she had slept
fast, and so brought him in the place there she lay fast sleeping.</p>
