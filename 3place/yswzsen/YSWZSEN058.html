<h4 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h4>
<p>How Sir Tor overcame the knight, and how he lost his head at the
request of a lady</p>
<p>With that came a damosel riding on a palfrey as fast as she might
drive, and cried with a loud voice unto Sir Tor.</p>
<p>‘What will ye with me?’ said Sir Tor.</p>
<p>‘I beseech thee,’ said the damosel, ‘for King Arthur’s love, give me
a gift; I require thee gentle knight, as thou art a gentleman.’</p>
<p>‘Now,’ said Tor, ‘ask a gift and I will give it you.’</p>
<p>‘Gramercy,’ said the damosel; ‘now I ask the head of the false knight
Abelleus, for he is the most outrageous knight that liveth, and the
greatest murderer.’</p>
<p>‘I am loth,’ said Sir Tor, ‘of that gift I have given you; let him
make amends in that he hath trespassed unto you.’</p>
<p>‘Now,’ said the damosel, ‘he may not, for he slew mine own brother
afore mine own eyen, that was a better knight than he, and he had had
grace; and I kneeled half an hour afore him in the mire for to save my
brother’s life, that had done him no damage, but fought with him by
adventure of arms, and so for all that I could do he struck off his
head; wherefore I require thee, as thou art a true knight, to give me my
gift, or else I shall shame thee in all the court of King Arthur; for he
is the falsest knight living, and a great destroyer of good
knights.’</p>
<p>Then when Abelleus heard this, he was more afeared, and yielded him
and asked mercy.</p>
<p>‘I may not now,’ said Sir Tor, ‘but if I should be found false of my
promise; for while I would have taken you to mercy ye would none ask but
if ye had the brachet again that was my quest.’</p>
<p>And therewith he took off his helm, and he arose and fled, and Sir
Tor after him, and smote off his head quite.</p>
<p>‘Now sir,’ said the damosel, ‘it is near night; I pray you come and
lodge with me here at my place, it is here fast by.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said Sir Tor, for his horse and he had fared evil
since they departed from Camelot.</p>
<p>And so he rode with her, and had passing good cheer with her; and she
had a passing fair old knight to her husband that made him passing good
cheer, and well eased both his horse and he. And on the morn he heard
his mass, and brake his fast, and took his leave of the knight and of
the lady, that besought him to tell him his name.</p>
<p>‘Truly,’ he said, ‘my name is Sir Tor that was late made knight, and
this was the first quest of arms that ever I did, to bring again that
this knight Abelleus took away from King Arthur’s court.’</p>
<p>‘O fair knight,’ said the lady and her husband, ‘and ye come here in
our marches, come and see our poor lodging, and it shall be always at
your commandment.’</p>
<p>So Sir Tor departed and came to Camelot on the third day by noon, and
the king and the queen and all the court was passing fain of his coming,
and made great joy that he was come again; for he went from the court
with little succour, but as King Pellinor his father gave him an old
courser, and King Arthur gave him armour and a sword, and else had he
none other succour, but rode so forth himself alone. And then the king
and the queen by Merlin’s advice made him to swear to tell of his
adventures, and so he told and made proofs of his deeds as it is afore
rehearsed, wherefore the king and the queen made great joy.</p>
<p>‘Nay, nay,’ said Merlin, ‘these be but japes to that he shall do; for
he shall prove a noble knight of prowess, as good as any is living, and
gentle and courteous, and of good tatches, and passing true of his
promise, and never shall outrage.’</p>
<p>Wherethrough Merlin’s words King Arthur gave him an earldom of lands
that fell unto him. And here endeth the quest of Sir Tor, King
Pellinor’s son.</p>
<p>sued: followed. gart: caused.</p>
