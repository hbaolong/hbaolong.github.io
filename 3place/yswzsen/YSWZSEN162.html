<h4 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram fought against Sir Marhaus and achieved his battle,
and how Sir Marhaus fled to his ship</p>
<p>And then Sir Marhaus advised Sir Tristram, and said thus: ‘Young
knight, Sir Tristram, what dost thou here? Me sore repenteth of thy
courage, for wit thou well I have been assayed, and the best knights of
this land have been assayed of my hand; and also I have matched with the
best knights of the world, and therefore by my counsel return again unto
thy vessel.’</p>
<p>‘And fair knight, and well-proved knight,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘thou
shalt well wit I may not forsake thee in this quarrel, for I am for thy
sake made knight. And thou shalt well wit that I am a king’s son born,
and gotten upon a queen; and such promise I have made at my nephew’s
request and mine own seeking, that I shall fight with thee unto the
uttermost, and deliver Cornwall from the old truage. And also wit thou
well, Sir Marhaus, that this is the greatest cause that thou couragest
me to have ado with thee, for thou art called one of the most renowned
knights of the world, and because of that noise and fame that thou hast
thou givest me courage to have ado with thee, for never yet was I proved
with good knight; and sithen I took the order of knighthood this day, I
am well pleased that I may have ado with so good a knight as thou art.
And now wit thou well, Sir Marhaus, that I cast me to get worship on thy
body; and if that I be not proved, I trust to God that I shall be
worshipfully proved upon thy body, and to deliver the country of
Cornwall for ever from all manner of truage from Ireland for ever.’</p>
<p>When Sir Marhaus had heard him say what he would, he said then thus
again: ‘Fair knight, sithen it is so that thou castest to win worship of
me, I let thee wit worship may thou none lose by me if thou mayest stand
me three strokes; for I let thee wit for my noble deeds, proved and
seen, King Arthur made me knight of the Table Round.’</p>
<p>Then they began to fewter their spears, and they met so fiercely
together that they smote either other down, both horse and all. But Sir
Marhaus smote Sir Tristram a great wound in the side with his spear, and
then they avoided their horses, and pulled out their swords, and threw
their shields afore them. And then they lashed together as men that were
wild and courageous. And when they had stricken so together long, then
they left their strokes, and foined at their breaths and visors; and
when they saw that that might not prevail them, then they hurtled
together like rams to bear either other down.</p>
<p>Thus they fought still more than half a day, and either were wounded
passing sore, that the blood ran down freshly from them upon the ground.
By then Sir Tristram waxed more fresher than Sir Marhaus, and better
winded and bigger; and with a mighty stroke he smote Sir Marhaus upon
the helm such a buffet that it went through his helm, and through the
coif of steel, and through the brain-pan, and the sword stuck so fast in
the helm and in his brain-pan that Sir Tristram pulled thrice at his
sword or ever he might pull it out from his head; and there Marhaus fell
down on his knees, the edge of Tristram’s sword left in his brain-pan.
And suddenly Sir Marhaus rose grovelling, and threw his sword and his
shield from him, and so ran to his ships and fled his way, and Sir
Tristram had ever his shield and his sword.</p>
<p>And when Sir Tristram saw Sir Marhaus withdraw him, he said, ‘Ah! sir
knight of the Round Table, why withdrawest thou thee? Thou dost thyself
and thy kin great shame, for I am but a young knight, or now I was never
proved, and rather than I should withdraw me from thee, I had rather be
hew in 〔an〕 hundred pieces.’</p>
<p>Sir Marhaus answered no word but yede his way sore groaning.</p>
<p>‘Well, sir knight,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I promise thee thy sword and
thy shield shall be mine; and thy shield shall I wear in all places
where I ride on mine adventures, and in the sight of King Arthur and all
the Round Table.’</p>
<p>cast: intend.</p>
