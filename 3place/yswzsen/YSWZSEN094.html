<h4 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h4>
<p>How King Arthur being shipped and lying in his cabin had a marvellous
dream and of the exposition thereof</p>
<p>And as the king lay in his cabin in the ship, he fell in a slumbering
and dreamed a marvellous dream: him seemed that a dreadful dragon did
drown much of his people, and he came flying out of the west, and his
head was enamelled with azure, and his shoulders shone as gold, his
belly like mails of a marvellous hue, his tail full of tatters, his feet
full of fine sable, and his claws like fine gold; and an hideous flame
of fire flew out of his mouth, like as the land and water had flamed all
of fire. After, him seemed there came out of the orient a grimly boar
all black in a cloud, and his paws as big as a post; he was rugged
looking roughly, he was the foulest beast that ever man saw, he roared
and roamed so hideously that it were marvel to hear. Then the dreadful
dragon advanced him and came in the wind like a falcon giving great
strokes on the boar, and the boar hit him again with his grizzly tusks
that his breast was all bloody, and that the hot blood made all the sea
red of his blood. Then the dragon flew away all on an height, and came
down with such a swough, and smote the boar on the ridge, which was ten
foot large from the head to the tail, and smote the boar all to powder
both flesh and bones, that it flittered all abroad on the sea.</p>
<p>And therewith the king awoke anon, and was sore abashed of this
dream, and sent anon for a wise philosopher, commanding to tell him the
signification of his dream.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the philosopher, ‘the dragon that thou dreamedst of
betokeneth thine own person that sailest here, and the colours of his
wings be thy realms that thou hast won, and his tail which is all
to-tattered signifieth the noble knights of the Round Table; and the
boar that the dragon slew coming from the clouds betokeneth some tyrant
that tormenteth the people, or else thou art like to fight with some
giant thyself, being horrible and abominable, whose peer ye saw never in
your days, wherefore of this dreadful dream doubt thee nothing, but as a
conqueror come forth thyself.’</p>
<p>Then after this soon they had sight of land, and sailed till they
arrived at Barflete in Flanders, and when they were there he found many
of his great lords ready, as they had been commanded to await upon
him.</p>
<p>cogs: broadly built ships. dromonds: large ships.</p>
