<h4 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h4>
<p>How Accolon found himself by a well, and he took upon him to do
battle against Arthur</p>
<p>Now turn we unto Accolon of Gaul, that when he awoke he found himself
by a deep well-side, within half a foot, in great peril of death. And
there came out of that fountain a pipe of silver, and out of that pipe
ran water all on high in a stone of marble. When Sir Accolon saw this,
he blessed him and said, ‘Jesu save my lord King Arthur, and King
Uriens, for these damosels in this ship have betrayed us, they were
devils and no women; and if I may escape this misadventure, I shall
destroy all where I may find these false damosels that usen
enchantments.’</p>
<p>Right with that there came a dwarf with a great mouth and a flat
nose, and saluted Sir Accolon, and said how he came from Queen Morgan le
Fay, ‘and she greeteth you well, and biddeth you be of strong heart, for
ye shall fight to-morn with a knight at the hour of prime, and therefore
she hath sent you here Excalibur, Arthur’s sword, and the scabbard, and
she biddeth you as ye love her, that ye do the battle to the uttermost,
without any mercy, like as ye had promised her when ye spake together in
private; and what damosel that bringeth her the knight’s head, which ye
shall fight withal, she will make her a queen.’</p>
<p>‘Now I understand you well,’ said Accolon, ‘I shall hold that I have
promised her now I have the sword. When saw ye my lady Queen Morgan le
Fay?’</p>
<p>‘Right late,’ said the dwarf.</p>
<p>Then Accolon took him in his arms and said, ‘Recommend me unto my
lady queen, and tell her all shall be done that I have promised her, and
else I will die for it. Now I suppose,’ said Accolon, ‘she hath made all
these crafts and enchantment for this battle.’</p>
<p>‘Ye may well believe it,’ said the dwarf.</p>
<p>Right so there came a knight and a lady with six squires, and saluted
Accolon, and prayed him for to arise, and come and rest him at his
manor. And so Accolon mounted upon a void horse, and went with the
knight unto a fair manor by a priory, and there he had passing good
cheer.</p>
<p>Then Sir Damas sent unto his brother Sir Ontzlake, and bad make him
ready by to-morn at the hour of prime, and to be in the field to fight
with a good knight, for he had founden a good knight that was ready to
do battle at all points. When this word came unto Sir Ontzlake he was
passing heavy, for he was wounded a little tofore through both his
thighs with a spear, and made great dole; but as he was wounded he would
have taken the battle on hand. So it happed at that time, by the means
of Morgan le Fay, Accolon was with Sir Ontzlake lodged; and when he
heard of that battle, and how Ontzlake was wounded, he said that he
would fight for him, because Morgan le Fay had sent him Excalibur and
the sheath for to fight with the knight on the morn: this was the cause
Sir Accolon took the battle on hand. Then Sir Ontzlake was passing glad,
and thanked Sir Accolon with all his heart that he would do so much for
him. And therewithal Sir Ontzlake sent word unto his brother Sir Damas,
that he had a knight that for him should be ready in the field by the
hour of prime.</p>
<p>So on the morn Sir Arthur was armed and well horsed, and asked Sir
Damas, ‘When shall we to the field?’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Damas, ‘ye shall hear mass.’</p>
<p>And so Arthur heard a mass, and when mass was done there came a
squire on a great horse, and asked Sir Damas if his knight were ready,
‘for our knight is ready in the field.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Arthur mounted upon horseback, and there were all the
knights and commons of that country; and so by all advices there were
chosen twelve good men of the country for to wait upon the two
knights.</p>
<p>And right as Arthur was on horseback there came a damosel from Morgan
le Fay, and brought unto Sir Arthur a sword like unto Excalibur, and the
scabbard, and said unto Arthur, ‘Morgan le Fay sendeth here your sword
for great love.’</p>
<p>And he thanked her, and weened it had been so, but she was false, for
the sword and the scabbard was counterfeit, and brittle, and false.</p>
