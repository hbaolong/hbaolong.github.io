<h4 id="chapter-16">Chapter 16</h4>
<p>By then came into the field King Ban as fierce as a lion, with bands
of green and thereupon gold.</p>
<p>‘Ha! ah!’ said King Lot, ‘we must be discomfit, for yonder I see the
most valiant knight of the world, and the man of the most renown, for
such two brethren as is King Ban and King Bors are not living, wherefore
we must needs void or die; and but if we avoid manly and wisely there is
but death.’</p>
<p>When King Ban came into the battle, he came in so fiercely that the
strokes redounded again from the wood and the water; wherefore King Lot
wept for pity and dole that he saw so many good knights take their end.
But through the great force of King Ban they made both the northern
battles that were departed burtled together for great dread, and the
three kings and their knights slew on ever, that it was pity on to
behold that multitude of the people that fled.</p>
<p>But King Lot, and King of the Hundred Knights, and King Morganor
gathered the people together passing knightly, and did great prowess of
arms, and held the battle all that day, like hard. When the King of the
Hundred Knights beheld the great damage that King Ban did, he thrust
unto him with his horse, and smote him high upon the helm, a great
stroke, and stonied him sore. Then King Ban was wroth with him, and
followed on him fiercely; the other saw that, and cast up his shield,
and spurred his horse forward, but the stroke of King Ban fell down and
carved a cantel off the shield, and the sword slid down by the hauberk
behind his back, and cut through the trapper of steel and the horse even
in two pieces, that the sword felt the earth. Then the King of the
Hundred Knights voided the horse lightly, and with his sword he broached
the horse of King Ban through and through. With that King Ban voided
lightly from the dead horse, and then King Ban smote at the other so
eagerly, and smote him on the helm, that he fell to the earth. Also in
that ire he felled King Morganor, and there was great slaughter of good
knights and much people.</p>
<p>By then came into the press King Arthur, and found King Ban standing
among dead men and dead horse, fighting on foot as a wood lion, that
there came none nigh him as far as he might reach with his sword but he
caught a grievous buffet; whereof King Arthur had great pity. And Arthur
was so bloody, that by his shield there might no man know him, for all
was blood and brains on his sword. And as Arthur looked by him he saw a
knight that was passingly well horsed, and therewith Sir Arthur ran to
him, and smote him on the helm, that his sword went unto his teeth, and
the knight sank down to the earth dead, and anon Arthur took the horse
by the rein, and led him unto King Ban, and said, ‘Fair brother, have
this horse, for ye have great mister thereof, and me repenteth sore of
your great damage.’</p>
<p>‘It shall be soon revenged,’ said King Ban, ‘for I trust in God mine
eure is not such but some of them may sore repent this.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said Arthur, ‘for I see your deeds full actual;
nevertheless, I might not come at you at that time.’</p>
<p>But when King Ban was mounted on horseback, then there began new
battle the which was sore and hard, and passing great slaughter. And so
through great force King Arthur, King Ban, and King Bors made their
knights a little to withdraw them. But alway the eleven kings with their
chivalry never turned back; and so withdrew them to a little wood, and
so over a little river, and there they rested them, for on the night
they might have no rest on the field. And then the eleven kings and
knights put them on a heap all together, as men adread and out of all
comfort. But there was no man might pass them, they held them so hard
together both behind and before, that King Arthur had marvel of their
deeds of arms, and was passing wroth.</p>
<p>‘Ah, Sir Arthur,’ said King Ban and King Bors, ‘blame them not, for
they do as good men ought to do.’</p>
<p>‘For, by my faith,’ said King Ban, ‘they are the best fighting men,
and knights of most prowess, that ever I saw or heard speak of, and
those eleven kings are men of great worship; and if they were longing
unto you there were no king under the heaven had such eleven knights,
and of such worship.’</p>
<p>‘I may not love them,’ said Arthur, ‘they would destroy me.’</p>
<p>‘That wot we well,’ said King Ban and King Bors, ‘for they are your
mortal enemies, and that hath been proved aforehand, and this day they
have done their part, and that is great pity of their wilfulness.’</p>
<p>Then all the eleven kings drew them together, and then said King Lot,
‘Lords, ye must other ways than ye do, or else the great loss is behind;
ye may see what people we have lost, and what good men we lose, because
we wait always on these foot-men, and ever in saving of one of the
foot-men we lose ten horsemen for him; therefore this is mine advice:
let us put our foot-men from us, for it is near night, for the noble
Arthur will not tarry on the foot-men, for they may save themselves, the
wood is near hand. And when we horsemen be together, look every each of
you kings let make such ordinance that none break upon pain of death.
And who that seeth any man dress him to flee, lightly that he be slain,
for it is better that we slay a coward, than through a coward all we to
be slain. How say ye?’ said King Lot, ‘Answer me all ye kings.’</p>
<p>‘It is well said,’ quoth King Nentres; so said the King of the
Hundred Knights; the same said the King Carados, and King Uriens; so did
King Idres and King Brandegoris: and so did King Cradelment, and the
Duke of Cambenet; the same said King Clarivaus and King Agwisance, and
sware they would never fail other, neither for life nor for death. And
whoso that fled, but did as they did, should be slain. Then they amended
their harness, and righted their shields, and took new spears and set
them on their thighs, and stood still as it had been a plumb of
wood.</p>
