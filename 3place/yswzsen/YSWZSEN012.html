<h4 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h4>
<p>Of a great tourney made by King Arthur and the two Kings Ban and
Bors, and how they went over the sea</p>
<p>And King Arthur and the two kings let depart the seven hundred
knights in two parties. And there were three hundred knights of the
realm of Benwick and of Gaul turned on the other side. Then they dressed
their shields, and began to couch their spears, many good knights. So
Griflet was the first that met with a knight, one Ladinas, and they met
so eagerly that all men had wonder; and they so fought that their
shields fell to pieces, and horse and man fell to the earth; and both
the French knight and the English knight lay so long that all men weened
they had been dead.</p>
<p>When Lucan the Butler saw Griflet so lie, he horsed him again anon,
and they two did marvellous deeds of arms with many bachelors. Also Sir
Kay came out of an ambushment with five knights with him, and they six
smote other six down. But Sir Kay did that day marvellous deeds of arms
that there was none did so well as he that day. Then there came Ladinas
and Gracian, two knights of France, and did passing well, that all men
praised them. Then came there Sir Placidas, a good knight, and met with
Sir Kay, and smote him down horse and man, wherefore Sir Griflet was
wroth, and met with Sir Placidas so hard, that horse and man fell to the
earth. But when the five knights wist that Sir Kay had a fall, they were
wroth out of wit, and therewith each of them five bare down a
knight.</p>
<p>When King Arthur and the two kings saw them begin wax wroth on both
parties, they leapt on small hackneys, and let cry that all men should
depart unto their lodging. And so they went home and unarmed them, and
so to evensong and supper. And after, the three kings went into a
garden, and gave the prize unto Sir Kay, and to Lucan the Butler, and
unto Sir Griflet. And then they went unto council, and with them
Gwenbaus, the brother unto Sir Ban and Bors, a wise clerk, and thither
went Ulfius and Brastias, and Merlin. And after they had been in
council, they went unto bed.</p>
<p>And on the morn they heard mass, and to dinner, and so to their
council, and made many arguments what were best to do. At the last they
were concluded, that Merlin should go with a token of King Ban, and that
was a ring, unto his men and King Bors’; and Gracian and Placidas should
go again and keep their castles and their countries, as for King Ban of
Benwick, and King Bors of Gaul had ordained them, and so passed the sea
and came to Benwick. And when the people saw King Ban’s ring, and
Gracian and Placidas, they were glad, and asked how the kings fared, and
made great joy of their welfare and cording, and according unto the
sovereign lords’ desire, the men of war made them ready in all haste
possible, so that they were fifteen thousand on horse and foot, and they
had great plenty of victual with them, by Merlin’s provision. But
Gracian and Placidas were left to furnish and garnish the castles, for
dread of King Claudas.</p>
<p>Right so Merlin passed the sea well victualled both by water and by
land. And when he came to the sea he sent home the foot men again, and
took no more with him but ten thousand men on horseback, the most part
men of arms, and so shipped and passed the sea into England and landed
at Dover. And through the wit of Merlin, he1 led the host northward, the
priviest way that could be thought, unto the Forest of Bedegraine, and
there in a valley he lodged them secretly. Then rode Merlin unto Arthur
and the two kings, and told them how he had sped, whereof they had great
marvel, that man on earth might speed so soon, and go and come. So
Merlin told them ten thousand were in the Forest of Bedegraine, well
armed at all points. Then was there no more to say, but to horseback
went all the host as Arthur had afore purveyed. So with twenty thousand
he passed by night and day. But there was made such an ordinance afore
by Merlin, that there should no man of war ride nor go in no country on
this side Trent water, but if he had a token from King Arthur, where
through the king’s enemies durst not ride as they did tofore to
espy.</p>
