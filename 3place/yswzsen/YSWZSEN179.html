<h4 id="chapter-24">Chapter 24</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram demanded La Beale Isoud for King Mark, and how Sir
Tristram and Isoud drank the love drink</p>
<p>Then upon a day King Agwisance asked Sir Tristram why he asked not
his boon, for whatsomever he had promised him he should have it without
fail.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘now is it time; this is all that I will
desire, that ye will give me La Beale Isoud, your daughter, not for
myself, but for mine uncle, King Mark, that shall have her to wife, for
so have I promised him.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said the king, ‘I had lever than all the land that I have ye
would wed her yourself.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, and I did then I were shamed for ever in this world, and false
of my promise. Therefore,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I pray you hold your
promise that ye promised me; for this is my desire, that ye will give me
La Beale Isoud to go with me unto Cornwall for to be wedded to King
Mark, mine uncle.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said King Agwisance, ‘ye shall have her with you to do
with her what it please you; that is for to say if that ye list to wed
her yourself, that is me levest, and if ye will give her unto King Mark,
your uncle, that is in your choice.’</p>
<p>So to make short conclusion, La Beale Isoud was made ready to go with
Sir Tristram, and Dame Bragwaine went with her for her chief
gentlewoman, with many other.</p>
<p>Then the queen, Isoud’s mother, gave to her and Dame Bragwaine, her
daughter’s gentlewoman, and unto Gouvernail, a drink,1 and charged them
that what day King Mark should wed, that same day they should give him
that drink, so that King Mark should drink to La Beale Isoud, ‘and
then,’ said the queen, ‘I undertake either shall love other the days of
their life,’ So this drink was given unto Dame Bragwaine, and unto
Gouvernail.</p>
<p>And then anon Sir Tristram took the sea, and La Beale Isoud; and when
they were in their cabin, it happed so that they were thirsty, and they
saw a little flacket of gold stand by them, and it seemed by the colour
and the taste that it was noble wine.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram took the flacket in his hand, and said, ‘Madam
Isoud, here is the best drink that ever ye drank, that Dame Bragwaine,
your maiden, and Gouvernail, my servant, have kept for themself.’</p>
<p>Then they laughed and made good cheer, and either drank to other
freely, and they thought never drink that ever they drank to other was
so sweet nor so good. But by that their drink was in their bodies, they
loved either other so well that never their love departed for weal
neither for woe. And thus it happed the love first betwixt Sir Tristram
and La Beale Isoud, the which love never departed the days of their
life.</p>
<p>So then they sailed till by fortune, they came nigh a castle that
hight Pluere, and thereby arrived for to repose them, weening to them to
have had good harbour. But anon as Sir Tristram was within the castle
they were taken prisoners; for the custom of the castle was such, who
that rode by that castle and brought any lady, he must needs fight with
the lord, that high Breunor. And if it were so that Breunor won the
field, then should the knight stranger and his lady be put to death,
what that ever they were; and if it were so that the strange knight won
the field of Sir Breunor, then should he die and his lady both. This
custom was used many winters, for it was called the Castle Pluere, that
is to say the Weeping Castle.</p>
