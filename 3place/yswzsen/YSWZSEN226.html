<h4 id="chapter-30">Chapter 30</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram returned against King Arthur’s party because he saw
Sir Palomides on that party</p>
<p>Then upon the morn Sir Palomides returned from the King of
Northgales, and rode to King Arthur’s side, where was King Carados, and
the King of Ireland, and Sir Launcelot’s kin and Sir Gawain’s kin. So
Sir Palomides sent the damosel unto Sir Tristram that he sent to seek
him when he was out of his mind in the forest, and this damosel asked
Sir Tristram what he was and what was his name?</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘tell Sir Palomides ye shall not
wit as at this time unto the time I have broken two spears upon him. But
let him wit thus much,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘that I am the same knight
that he smote down in over evening at the tournament; and tell him
plainly on what party that Sir Palomides be, I will be of the contrary
party.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the damosel, ‘ye shall understand that Sir Palomides will
be on King Arthur’s side, where the most noble knights of the world
be.’</p>
<p>‘In the name of God,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘then will I be with the
King of Northgales, because Sir Palomides will be on King Arthur’s side,
and else I would not but for his sake.’</p>
<p>So when King Arthur was come they blew unto the field; and then there
began a great party, and so King Carados jousted with the King of the
Hundred Knights, and there King Carados had a fall: then was there
hurling and rashing, and right so came in knights of King Arthur’s, and
they bare aback the King of Northgales’ knights.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram came in, and began so roughly and so bigly that
there was none might withstand him, and thus Sir Tristram dured long.
And at the last Sir Tristram fell among the fellowship of King Ban, and
there fell upon him Sir Bors de Ganis, and Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir
Blamor de Ganis, and many other knights. And then Sir Tristram smote on
the right hand and on the left hand, that all lords and ladies spake of
his noble deeds.</p>
<p>But at the last Sir Tristram should have had the worse had not the
King with the Hundred Knights been. And then he came with his fellowship
and rescued Sir Tristram, and brought him away from those knights that
bare the shields of Cornwall.</p>
<p>And then Sir Tristram saw another fellowship by themself, and there
were a forty knights together, and Sir Kay, the Seneschal, was their
governor. Then Sir Tristram rode in amongst them, and there he smote
down Sir Kay from his horse; and there he fared among those knights like
a grey-hound among conies.</p>
<p>Then Sir Launcelot found a knight that was sore wounded upon the
head.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘who wounded you so sore?’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ he said, ‘a knight that beareth a black shield, and I may
curse the time that ever I met with him, for he is a devil and no
man.’</p>
<p>So Sir Launcelot departed from him and thought to meet with Sir
Tristram, and so he rode with his sword drawn in his hand to seek Sir
Tristram; and then he espied him how he hurled here and there, and at
every stroke Sir Tristram well-nigh smote down a knight.</p>
<p>‘O mercy Jesu!’ said the king. ‘Sith the time I bare arms saw I never
no knight do so marvellous deeds of arms.’</p>
<p>‘And if I should set upon this knight,’ said Sir Launcelot to
himself, ‘I did shame to myself,’ and therewithal Sir Launcelot put up
his sword.</p>
<p>And then the King with the Hundred Knights and an hundred more of
North Wales set upon the twenty of Sir Launcelot’s kin: and they twenty
knights held them ever together as wild swine, and none would fail
other. And so when Sir Tristram beheld the noblesse of these twenty
knights he marvelled of their good deeds, for he saw by their fare and
by their rule that they had lever die than avoid the field.</p>
<p>‘Now Jesu,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘well may he be valiant and full of
prowess that hath such a sort of noble knights unto his kin, and full
like is he to be a noble man that is their leader and governor.’ He
meant it by Sir Launcelot du Lake.</p>
<p>So when Sir Tristram had beholden them long he thought shame to see
two hundred knights battering upon twenty knights. Then Sir Tristram
rode unto the King with the Hundred Knights and said,</p>
<p>‘Sir, leave your fighting with those twenty knights, for ye win no
worship of them, ye be so many and they so few; and wit ye well they
will not out of the field, I see by their cheer and countenance; and
worship get ye none and ye slay them. Therefore leave your fighting with
them, for I to increase my worship I will ride to the twenty knights and
help them with all my might and power.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said the King with the Hundred Knights, ‘ye shall not do so;
now I see your courage and courtesy I will withdraw my knights for your
pleasure, for evermore a good knight will favour another, and like will
draw to like.’</p>
