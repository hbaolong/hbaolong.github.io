<h4 id="chapter-39">Chapter 39</h4>
<p>How after that Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan had been
long in prison, they were delivered</p>
<p>Now leave we off this tale, and speak we of Sir Dinas that had within
the castle a paramour, and she loved another knight better than him. And
so when Sir Dinas went out on hunting she slipped down by a towel, and
took with her two brachets, and so she yede to the knight that she
loved, and he her again.</p>
<p>And when Sir Dinas came home and missed his paramour and his
brachets, then was he the more wrother for his brachets than for the
lady. So then he rode after the knight that had his paramour, and bad
him turn and joust. So Sir Dinas smote him down, that with the fall he
brake his leg and his arm. And then his lady and paramour cried Sir
Dinas mercy, and said she would love him better than ever she did.</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Dinas, ‘I shall never trust them that once betrayed
me, and therefore as ye have begun so end, for I will never meddle with
you.’</p>
<p>And so Sir Dinas departed, and took his brachets with him, and so
rode to his castle.</p>
<p>Now will we turn unto Sir Launcelot, that was right heavy that he
could never hear no tidings of Sir Tristram, for all this while he was
in prison with Sir Darras, Palomides, and Dinadan.</p>
<p>Then Dame Bragwaine took her leave to go into Cornwall, and Sir
Launcelot, Sir Kay, and Sir Gaheris rode to seek Sir Tristram in the
country of Surluse.</p>
<p>Now speaketh this tale of Sir Tristram and of his two fellows, for
every day Sir Palomides brawled and said language against Sir
Tristram.</p>
<p>‘I marvel,’ said Sir Dinadan, ‘of thee, Sir Palomides, and thou
hadest Sir Tristram here thou wouldst do him no harm; for and a wolf and
a sheep were together in a prison the wolf would suffer the sheep to be
in peace. And wit thou well,’ said Sir Dinadan, ‘this same is Sir
Tristram at a word, and now mayst thou do thy best with him, and let see
now if ye can skift it with your hands.’</p>
<p>Then was Sir Palomides abashed and said little.</p>
<p>‘Sir Palomides,’ then said Sir Tristram, ‘I have heard much of your
maugre against me, but I will not meddle with you as at this time by my
will, because I dread the lord of this place that hath us in governance;
for and I dread him not more than I do thee, soon it should be skift.’
So they peaced themself.</p>
<p>Right so came in a damosel and said, ‘Knights, be of good cheer, for
ye are sure of your lives, and that I heard say my lord, Sir
Darras.’</p>
<p>Then were they glad all three, for daily they weened they should have
died.</p>
<p>Then soon after this Sir Tristram fell sick that he weened to have
died; then Sir Dinadan wept, and so did Sir Palomides, under them both
making great sorrow. So a damosel came in to them and found them
mourning.</p>
<p>Then she went unto Sir Darras, and told him how that mighty knight
that bare the black shield was likely to die.</p>
<p>‘That shall not be,’ said Sir Darras, ‘for God defend when knights
come to me for succour that I should suffer them to die within my
prison. Therefore,’ said Sir Darras to the damosel, ‘fetch that knight
and his fellows afore me.’</p>
<p>And then anon Sir Darras saw Sir Tristram brought afore him. He said,
‘Sir knight, me repenteth of thy sickness, for thou art called a full
noble knight, and so it seemeth by thee; and wit ye well it shall never
be said that Sir Darras shall destroy such a noble knight as thou art in
prison, howbeit that thou hast slain three of my sons, whereby I was
greatly aggrieved. But now shalt thou go and thy fellows, and your
harness and horses have been fair and clean kept, and ye shall go where
it liketh you, upon this covenant, that thou, knight, wilt promise me to
be good friend to my sons two that be now alive and also that thou tell
me thy name.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said he, ‘as for me my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and in
Cornwall was I born, and nephew I am unto King Mark. And as for the
death of your sons I might not do withal, for and they had been the next
kin that I have I might have done none otherwise. And if I had slain
them by treason or treachery I had been worthy to have died.’</p>
<p>‘All this I consider,’ said Sir Darras, ‘that all that ye did was by
force of knighthood, and that was the cause I would not put you to
death. But sith ye be Sir Tristram, the good knight, I pray you heartily
to be my good friend and to my sons.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I promise you by the faith of my body,
ever while I live I will do you service, for ye have done to us but as a
natural knight ought to do.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram reposed him there till that he was amended of his
sickness; and when he was big and strong they took their leave, and
every knight took their horses, and so departed and rode together till
they came to a cross way.</p>
<p>‘Now fellows,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘here will we depart in sundry
ways.’</p>
<p>And because Sir Dinadan had the first adventure, of him I will
begin.</p>
<p>skift: manage. maugre: ill-will.</p>
