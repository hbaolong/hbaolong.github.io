<h4 id="chapter-25">Chapter 25</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram and lsoud were in prison, and how he fought for her
beauty, and smote off another lady’s head</p>
<p>Thus as Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud were in prison, it happed a
knight and a lady came unto them where they were, to cheer them.</p>
<p>‘I have marvel,’ said Tristram unto the knight and the lady, ‘what is
the cause the lord of this castle holdeth us in prison. It was never the
custom of no place of worship that ever I came in, when a knight and a
lady asked harbour, and they to receive them, and after to destroy them
that be his guests.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the knight, ‘this is the old custom of this castle, that
when a knight cometh here he must needs fight with our lord, and he that
is the weaker must lose his head. And when that is done, if his lady
that he bringeth be fouler than our lord’s wife, she must lose her head,
and if she be fairer proved than is our lady, then shall the lady of
this castle lose her head.’</p>
<p>‘So God help me,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘this is a foul custom and a
shameful. But one advantage have I,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I have a lady
is fair enough, fairer saw I never in all my life days, and I doubt not
for lack of beauty she shall not lose her head; and rather than I should
lose my head I will fight for it on a fair field. Wherefore, sir knight,
I pray you tell your lord that I will be ready as tomorn with my lady,
and myself to do battle, if it be so I may have my horse and mine
armour.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said that knight, ‘I undertake that your desire shall be sped
right well.’ And then he said, ‘Take your rest, and look that ye be up
betimes and make you ready and your lady, for ye shall want no thing
that you behoveth.’</p>
<p>And therewith he departed, and on the morn betimes that same knight
came to Sir Tristram, and fetched him out and his lady, and brought him
horse and armour that was his own, and bad him make him ready to the
field, for all the estates and commons of that lordship were there ready
to behold that battle and judgement.</p>
<p>Then came Sir Breunor, the lord of that castle, with his lady in his
hand, muffled, and asked Sir Tristram where was his lady: ‘For and thy
lady be fairer than mine, with thy sword smite off my lady’s head; and
if my lady be fairer than thine,1 with my sword I must strike off her
head. And if I may win thee, yet shall thy lady be mine, and thou shalt
lose thy head.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Tristram, ‘this is a foul custom and horrible; and rather
than my lady should lose her head, yet had I lever lose my head.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, nay,’ said Sir Breunor, ‘the ladies shall be first showed
together, and the one shall have her judgement.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, I will not so,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘for here is none that will
give righteous judgement. But I doubt not,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘my lady
is fairer than thine, and that will I prove and make good with my hand.
And who somever he be that will say the contrary I will prove it on his
head.’</p>
<p>And therewith Sir Tristram showed La Beale Isoud, and turned her
thrice about with his naked sword in his hand. And when Sir Brenuor saw
that, he did the same wise turn his lady. But when Sir Breunor beheld La
Beale Isoud, him thought he saw never a fairer lady, and then he dread
his lady’s head should be off. And so all the people that were there
present gave judgement that La Beale Isoud was the fairer lady and the
better made.</p>
<p>‘How now?’ said Sir Tristram, ‘Meseemeth it were pity that my lady
should lose her head, but because thou and she of long time have used
this wicked custom, and by you both have many good knights and ladies
been destroyed, for that cause it were no loss to destroy you both.’</p>
<p>‘So God me help,’ said Sir Breunor, ‘for to say the sooth, thy lady
is fairer than mine, and that me sore repenteth. And so I hear the
people privily say, for of all women I saw none so fair; and therefore,
and thou wilt slay my lady, I doubt not but I shall slay thee and have
thy lady.’</p>
<p>‘Thou shalt win her,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘as dear as ever knight won
lady. And because of thine own judgement, as thou wouldst have done to
my lady if that she had been fouler, and because of the evil custom,
give me thy lady,’ said Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>And therewithal Sir Tristram strode unto him and took his lady from
him, and with an awke stroke he smote off her head clean.</p>
<p>‘Well, knight,’ said Sir Breunor, ‘now hast thou done me a
despite.’</p>
<p>1 behoveth: is necessary.</p>
