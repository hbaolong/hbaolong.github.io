<h4 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h4>
<p>Of the battle between King Arthur and Accolon</p>
<p>And then they dressed them on both parts of the field, and let their
horses run so fast that either smote other in the midst of the shield
with their spear’s head, that both horse and man went to the earth; and
then they start up both, and pulled out their swords.</p>
<p>The meanwhile that they were thus at the battle, came the damosel of
the lake into the field, that put Merlin under the stone; and she came
thither for love of King Arthur, for she knew how Morgan le Fay had so
ordained that King Arthur should have been slain that day, and therefore
she came to save his life.</p>
<p>And so they went eagerly to the battle, and gave many great strokes,
but always Arthur’s sword bit not like Accolon’s sword; but for the most
part, every stroke that Accolon gave he wounded sore Arthur, that it was
marvel he stood, and always his blood fell from him fast. When Arthur
beheld the ground so sore be-bled he was dismayed, and then he deemed
treason that his sword was changed; for his sword bit not steel as it
was wont to do, therefore he dread him sore to be dead, for ever him
seemed that the sword in Accolon’s hand was Excalibur, for at every
stroke that Accolon struck he drew blood on Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Now, knight,’ said Accolon unto Arthur, ‘keep thee well from
me.’</p>
<p>But Arthur answered not again, and gave him such a buffet on the helm
that he made him to stoop, nigh falling down to the earth. Then Sir
Accolon withdrew him a little, and came on with Excalibur on high, and
smote Sir Arthur such a buffet that he fell nigh to the earth. Then were
they wroth both, and gave each other many sore strokes, but always Sir
Arthur lost so much blood that it was marvel he stood on his feet, but
he was so full of knighthood that knightly he endured the pain. And Sir
Accolon lost not a deal of blood, therefore he waxed passing light, and
Sir Arthur was passing feeble, and weened verily to have died; but for
all that he made countenance as though he might endure, and held Accolon
as short as he might. But Accolon was so bold because of Excalibur that
he waxed passing hardy. But all men that beheld him said they saw never
knight fight so well as Arthur did considering the blood that he
bled.</p>
<p>So was all the people sorry for him, but the two brethren would not
accord; then always they fought together as fierce knights, and Sir
Arthur withdrew him a little for to rest him, and Sir Accolon called him
to battle and said, ‘It is no time for me to suffer thee to rest.’ And
therewith he came fiercely upon Arthur, and Sir Arthur was wroth for the
blood that he had lost, and smote Accolon on high upon the helm, so
mightily, that he made him nigh to fall to the earth; and therewith
Arthur’s sword brast at the cross, and fell in the grass among the
blood, and the pommel and the sure handles he held in his hands. When
Sir Arthur saw that, he was in great fear to die, but always he held up
his shield and lost no ground, nor bated no cheer.</p>
