<h4 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h4>
<p>How Sir Launcelot met with the damosel named Maledisant, and named
her the Damosel Bienpensant</p>
<p>So then they took their horses and rode forth a pace after Sir
Launcelot. And within two mile they overtook him, and saluted him, and
thanked him, and the damosel cried Sir Launcelot mercy of her evil deed
and saying,</p>
<p>‘For now I know the flower of all knighthood is departed even between
Sir Tristram and you. For God knoweth,’ said the damosel, ‘that I have
sought you my lord, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Tristram long, and now I
thank God I have met with you. And once at Camelot I met with Sir
Tristram, and there he rescued this black shield with the white hand
holding a naked sword that Sir Breunis Saunce Pité had taken from
me.’</p>
<p>‘Now, fair damosel,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘who told you my name?’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said she, ‘there came a damosel from a knight that ye fought
withal at the bridge, and she told me your name was Sir Launcelot du
Lake.’</p>
<p>‘Blame have she then,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘but her lord, Sir
Nerovens, hath told her. But, damosel,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘upon this
covenant I will ride with you, so that ye will not rebuke this knight
Sir La Cote Male Taile no more; for he is a good knight, and I doubt not
he shall prove a noble knight, and for his sake and pity that he should
not be destroyed I followed him to succour him in this great need.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, Jesu thank you,’ said the damosel, ‘for now I will say unto you
and to him both, I rebuked him never for no hate that I hated him, but
for great love that I had to him. For ever I supposed that he had been
too young and too tender to take upon him these adventures. And
therefore by my will I would have driven him away for jealousy that I
had of his life, for it may be no young knight’s deed that shall achieve
this adventure to the end.’</p>
<p>‘Perdy,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘it is well said, and where ye are
called the Damosel Maledisant I will call you the Damosel
Bienpensant.’</p>
<p>And so they rode forth a great while unto they came to the border of
the country of Surluse, and there they found a fair village with a
strong bridge like a fortress. And when Sir Launcelot and they were at
the bridge there start forth afore them of gentlemen and yeomen many,
that said,</p>
<p>‘Fair lords, ye may not pass this bridge and this fortress because of
that black shield that I see one of you bear, and therefore there shall
not pass but one of you at once; therefore choose you which of you shall
enter within this bridge first.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Launcelot proffered himself first to enter within this
bridge.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said La Cote Male Taile, ‘I beseech you let me enter within
this fortress, and if I may speed well I will send for you, and if it
happened that I be slain, there it goeth. And if so be that I am a
prisoner taken, then may ye rescue me.’</p>
<p>‘I am loth,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘to let you pass this passage.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said La Cote Male Taile, ‘I pray you let me put my body in
this adventure.’</p>
<p>‘Now go your way,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘and Jesu be your speed.’</p>
<p>So he entered, and anon there met with him two brethren, the one
hight Sir Plaine de Force, and the other hight Sir Plaine de Amours. And
anon they met with Sir La Cote Male Taile; and first La Cote Male Taile
smote down Plaine de Force, and after he smote down Plaine de Amours;
and then they dressed them to their shields and swords, and bad La Cote
Male Taile alight, and so he did; and there was dashing and foining with
swords and so they began to assail full hard La Cote Male Taile, and
many great wounds they gave him upon his head, and upon his breast, and
upon his shoulders. And as he might ever among he gave sad strokes
again. And then the two brethren traced and traversed for to be of both
hands of Sir La Cote Male Taile, but he by fine force and knightly
prowess gat them afore him. And then when he felt himself so wounded,
then he doubled his strokes, and gave them so many wounds that he felled
them to the earth, and would have slain them had they not yielded
them.</p>
<p>And right so Sir La Cote Male Taile took the best horse that there
was of them three, and so rode forth his way to the other fortress and
bridge; and there he met with the third brother whose name was Sir
Plenorius, a full noble knight, and there they jousted together, and
either smote other down, horse and man, to the earth. And then they
avoided their horses, and dressed their shields, and drew their swords,
and gave many sad strokes, and one while the one knight was afore on the
bridge, and another while the other. And thus they fought two hours and
more, and never rested. And ever Sir Launcelot and the damosel beheld
them.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said the damosel, ‘my knight fighteth passing sore and over
long.’</p>
<p>‘Now may ye see,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘that he is a noble knight, for
to consider his first battle, and his grievous wounds; and even
forthwithal so wounded as he is, it is marvel that he may endure this
long battle with that good knight.’</p>
