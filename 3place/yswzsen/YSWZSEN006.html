<h4 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h4>
<p>How Arthur was chosen king, and of wonders and marvels of a sword
taken out of a stone by the said Arthur</p>
<p>Then stood the realm in great jeopardy long while, for every lord
that was mighty of men made him strong, and many weened to have been
king. Then Merlin went to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and counselled
him for to send for all the lords of the realm, and all the gentlemen of
arms, that they should to London come by Christmas, upon pain of
cursing; and for this cause: that Jehu, that was born on that night,
that He would of his great mercy show some miracle, as He was come to be
king of mankind, for to show some miracle who should be rightwise king
of this realm. So the Archbishop, by the advice of Merlin, sent for all
the lords and gentlemen of arms that they should come by Christmas even
unto London. And many of them made them clean of their life, that their
prayer might be the more acceptable unto God.</p>
<p>So in the greatest church of London (whether it were Paul’s or not
the French book maketh no mention) all the estates were long or day in
the church for to pray. And when matins and the first mass was done,
there was seen in the churchyard, against the high altar, a great stone
four square, like unto a marble stone, and in midst thereof was like an
anvil of steel a foot on high, and therein stuck a fair sword naked by
the point, and letters there were written in gold about the sword that
saiden thus:–WHOSO PULLETH OUT THIS SWORD OF THIS STONE AND ANVIL, IS
RIGHT-WISE KING BORN OF ALL ENGLAND. Then the people marvelled, and told
it to the Archbishop.</p>
<p>‘I command,’ said the Archbishop, ‘that ye keep you within your
church, and pray unto God still; that no man touch the sword till the
high mass be all done.’</p>
<p>So when all masses were done all the lords went to behold the stone
and the sword. And when they saw the scripture, some assayed, such as
would have been king. But none might stir the sword nor move it.</p>
<p>‘He is not here,’ said the Archbishop, ‘that shall achieve the sword,
but doubt not God will make him known. But this is my counsel,’ said the
Archbishop, ‘that we let purvey ten knights, men of good fame, and they
to keep this sword.’</p>
<p>So it was ordained, and then there was made a cry, that every man
should assay that would, for to win the sword. And upon New Year’s Day
the barons let make a jousts and a tournament, that all knights that
would joust or tourney there might play. And all this was ordained for
to keep the lords together and the commons, for the Archbishop trusted
that God would make him known that should win the sword.</p>
<p>So upon New Year’s Day, when the service was done, the barons rode
unto the field, some to joust and some to tourney, and so it happed that
Sir Ector, that had great livelihood about London, rode unto the jousts,
and with him rode Sir Kay his son, and young Arthur that was his
nourished brother; and Sir Kay was made knight at All Hallowmass afore.
So as they rode to the jousts-ward, Sir Kay had lost his sword, for he
had left it at his father’s lodging, and so he prayed young Arthur for
to ride for his sword.</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said Arthur, and rode fast after the sword. And when
he came home the lady and all were out to see the jousting.</p>
<p>Then was Arthur wroth, and said to himself, ‘I will ride to the
churchyard, and take the sword with me that sticketh in the stone, for
my brother Sir Kay shall not be without a sword this day.’ So when he
came to the churchyard, Sir Arthur alit and tied his horse to the stile,
and so he went to the tent, and found no knights there, for they were at
jousting; and so he handled the sword by the handles, and lightly and
fiercely pulled it out of the stone, and took his horse and rode his way
until he came to his brother Sir Kay, and delivered him the sword.</p>
<p>And as soon as Sir Kay saw the sword, he wist well it was the sword
of the stone, and so he rode to his father Sir Ector, and said; ‘Sir, lo
here is the sword of the stone, wherefore I must be king of this
land.’</p>
<p>When Sir Ector beheld the sword, he returned again and came to the
church, and there they alit all three, and went into the church. And
anon he made Sir Kay to swear upon a book how he came to that sword.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Kay, ‘by my brother Arthur, for he brought it to
me.’</p>
<p>‘How gat ye this sword?’ said Sir Ector to Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Sir, I will tell you. When I came home for my brother’s sword, I
found nobody at home to deliver me his sword, and so I thought my
brother Sir Kay should not be swordless, and so I came hither eagerly
and pulled it out of the stone without any pain.’</p>
<p>‘Found ye any knights about this sword?’ said Sir Ector.</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Now,’ said Sir Ector to Arthur, ‘I understand ye must be king of
this land.’</p>
<p>‘Wherefore I,’ said Arthur, ‘and for what cause?’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Ector, ‘for God will have it so, for there should never
man have drawn out this sword, but he that shall be rightwise king of
this land. Now let me see whether ye can put the sword there as it was,
and pull it out again.’</p>
<p>‘That is no mastery,’ said Arthur, and so he put it in the stone;
therewithal Sir Ector assayed to pull out the sword and failed.</p>
