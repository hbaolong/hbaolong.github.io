<h4 id="chapter-23">Chapter 23</h4>
<p>How twelve knights came from Rome and asked truage for this land of
Arthur, and how Arthur fought with a knight</p>
<p>Then the knight saw him lie so on the ground; he alit, and was
passing heavy, for he weened he had slain him. And then he unlaced his
helm and gat him wind, and so with the truncheon he set him on his horse
and gat him wind, and so betook him to God, and said he had a mighty
heart, and if he might live he would prove a passing good knight. And so
Sir Griflet rode to the court, where great dole was made for him. But
through good leeches he was healed and saved.</p>
<p>Right so came into the court twelve knights, and were aged men, and
they came from the Emperor of Rome, and they asked of Arthur truage for
this realm, other else the emperor would destroy him and his land.</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said King Arthur, ‘ye are messengers, therefore ye may say
what ye will, other else ye should die therefore. But this is mine
answer: I owe the emperor no truage, nor none will I hold him, but on a
fair field I shall give him my truage that shall be with a sharp spear,
or else with a sharp sword, and that shall not be long, by my father’s
soul, Uther Pendragon.’</p>
<p>And therewith the messengers departed passingly wroth, and King
Arthur as wroth, for in evil time came they then; for the king was
passingly wroth for the hurt of Sir Griflet. And so he commanded a privy
man of his chamber, that or it be day his best horse and armour, with
all that longeth unto his person, be without the city or tomorrow day.
Right so or tomorrow day he met, with his man and his horse, and so
mounted up and dressed his shield and took his spear, and bad his
chamberlain tarry there till he came again.</p>
<p>And so Arthur rode a soft pace till it was day, and then was he ware
of three churls chasing Merlin, and would have slain him. Then the king
rode unto them, and bad them: ‘Flee, churls!’ then were they afeared
when they saw a knight, and fled.</p>
<p>‘O Merlin,’ said Arthur, ‘here hadst thou been slain for all thy
crafts had I not been.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Merlin, ‘not so, for I could save myself and I would; and
thou art more near thy death than I am, for thou goest to the deathward,
and God be not thy friend.’</p>
<p>So as they went thus talking they came to the fountain, and the rich
pavilion there by it. Then King Arthur was ware where sat a knight armed
in a chair.</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ said Arthur, ‘for what cause abidest thou here, that
there may no knight ride this way but if he joust with thee?’ said the
king. ‘I rede thee leave that custom,’ said Arthur.</p>
<p>‘This custom,’ said the knight, ‘have I used and will use maugre who
saith nay, and who is grieved with my custom let him amend it that
will.’</p>
<p>‘I will amend it,’ said Arthur.</p>
<p>‘I shall defend thee,’ said the knight.</p>
<p>Anon he took his horse and dressed his shield and took a spear, and
they met so hard either in other’s shields, that all to-shivered their
spears. Therewith anon Arthur pulled out his sword.</p>
<p>‘Nay, not so,’ said the knight; ‘it is fairer,’ said the knight,
‘that we twain run more together with sharp spears.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said Arthur, ‘and I had any more spears.’</p>
<p>‘I have enow,’ said the knight; so there came a squire and brought
two good spears, and Arthur chose one and he another.</p>
<p>So they spurred their horses and came together with all their
mights,1 that either brake their spears to their hands. Then Arthur set
hand on his sword.</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said the knight, ‘ye shall do better, ye are a passing good
jouster as ever I met withal, and once for the love of the high order of
knighthood let us joust once again.’</p>
<p>‘I assent me,’ said Arthur.</p>
<p>Anon there were brought two great spears, and every knight gat a
spear, and therewith they ran together that Arthur’s spear all
to-shivered. But the other knight hit him so hard in midst of the
shield, that horse and man fell to the earth, and therewith Arthur was
eager, and pulled out his sword, and said, ‘I will assay thee, sir
knight, on foot, for I have lost the honour on horseback.’</p>
<p>‘I will be on horseback,’ said the knight.</p>
<p>Then was Arthur wroth, and dressed his shield toward him with his
sword drawn. When the knight saw that, he alit, for him thought no
worship to have a knight at such avail, he to be on horseback and he on
foot, and so he alit and dressed his shield unto Arthur. And there began
a strong battle with many great strokes, and so hewed with their swords
that the cantels flew in the fields, and much blood they bled both, that
all the place there as they fought was overbled with blood, and thus
they fought long and rested them, and then they went to the battle
again, and so hurtled together like two rams that either fell to the
earth. So at the last they smote together that both their swords met
even together. But the sword of the knight smote King Arthur’s sword in
two pieces, wherefore he was heavy. Then said the knight unto Arthur,
‘Thou art in my danger whether me list to save thee or slay thee, and
but thou yield thee as overcome and recreant, thou shalt die.’</p>
<p>‘As for death,’ said King Arthur, ‘welcome be it it when it cometh,
but to yield me unto thee as recreant I had lever die than to be so
shamed.’</p>
<p>And wherewithal the king leapt unto Pellinor, and took him by the
middle and threw him down, and rased off his helm. When the knight felt
that, he was adread, for he was a passing big man of might, and anon he
brought Arthur under him, and rased off his helm and would have smitten
off his head.</p>
<p>that is me loth: I am reluctant. other else: or else. truage:
tribute.</p>
<p>rede: advise maugre: in spite of.</p>
<p>enow: enough. avail: advantage.</p>
