<h4 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h4>
<p>How King Arthur, King Ban, and King Bors rescued King Leodegrance,
and other incidents</p>
<p>And then King Arthur, and King Ban, and King Bors departed with their
fellowship, a twenty thousand, and came within six days into the country
of Camelerd, and there rescued King Leodegrance, and slew there much
people of King Rience, unto the number of ten thousand men, and put him
to flight.</p>
<p>And then had these three kings great cheer of King Leodegrance, that
thanked them of their great goodness, that they would revenge him of his
enemies; and there had Arthur the first sight of Guenever, the king’s
daughter of Camelerd, and ever after he loved her. After, they were
wedded, as it telleth in the book. So, briefly to make an end, they took
their leave to go into their own countries, for King Claudas did great
destruction on their lands.</p>
<p>‘Then’ said Arthur, ‘I will go with you.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said the kings, ‘ye shall not at this time, for ye have much
to do yet in these lands, therefore we will depart, and with the great
goods that we have gotten in these lands by your gifts, we shall wage
good knights and withstand the King Claudas’ malice, for by the grace of
God, and we have need we shall send to you for your succour; and if ye
have need, send for us, and we will not tarry, by the faith of our
bodies.’</p>
<p>‘It shall not,’ said Merlin, ‘need that these two kings come again in
the way of war, but I know well King Arthur may not be long from you,
for within a year or two ye shall have great need, and then shall he
revenge you on your enemies, as ye have done on his. For these eleven
kings shall die all in a day, by the great might and prowess of arms of
two valiant knights,’ (as it telleth after) ‘their names be Balin le
Savage, and Balan, his brother, that be marvellous good knights as be
any living.’</p>
<p>Now turn we to the eleven kings that returned unto a city that hight
Sorhaute, the which city was within King Uriens’, and there they
refreshed them as well as they might, and made leeches search their
wounds, and sorrowed greatly for the death of their people.</p>
<p>With that there came a messenger and told how there was comen into
their lands people that were lawless as well as Saracens, a forty
thousand, ‘and have burnt and slain all the people that they may come
by, without mercy, and have laid siege on the Castle of
Wandesborow.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said the eleven kings, ‘here is sorrow upon sorrow, and if we
had not warred against Arthur as we have done, he would soon revenge us;
as for King Leodegrance, he loveth Arthur better than us, and as for
King Rience, he hath enough to do with Leodegrance, for he hath laid
siege unto him.’ So they consented together to keep all the marches of
Cornwall, of Wales, and of the north.</p>
<p>So first, they put King Idres in the city of Nantes in Brittany, with
four thousand men of arms, to watch both the water and the land. Also
they put in the city of Windesan, King Nentres of Garlot, with four
thousand knights to watch both on water and on land. Also they had of
other men of war more than eight thousand, for to fortify all the
fortresses in the marches of Cornwall. Also they put more knights in all
the marches of Wales and Scotland, with many good men of arms, and so
they kept them together the space of three year, and ever allied them
with mighty kings and dukes and lords. And to them fell King Rience of
North Wales, the which was a mighty man of men, and Nero that was a
mighty man of men. And all this while they furnished them and garnished
them of good men of arms, and victual, and of all manner of habiliment
that pretendeth to the war, to avenge them for the battle of Bedegraine,
as it telleth in the book of adventures following.</p>
<p>wage: pay.</p>
<p>leeches: physicians.</p>
