<h4 id="chapter-31">Chapter 31</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram found Palomides by a well, and brought him with him
to his lodging</p>
<p>Then the King with the Hundred Knights withdrew his knights.</p>
<p>And all this while, and long tofore, Sir Launcelot had watched upon
Sir Tristram with a very purpose to have fellowshipped with him. And
then suddenly Sir Tristram, Sir Dinadan, and Gouvernail, his man, rode
their way into the forest, that no man perceived where they went.</p>
<p>So then King Arthur blew unto lodging, and gave the King of
Northgales the prize because Sir Tristram was upon his side.</p>
<p>Then Sir Launcelot rode here and there, so wood as lion that faulted
his fill, because he had lost Sir Tristram, and so he returned unto King
Arthur.</p>
<p>And then in all the field was a noise that with the wind it might be
heard two mile thence, how the lords and ladies cried, ‘The Knight with
the Black Shield hath won the field!’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said King Arthur, ‘where is that knight become? It is shame
to all those in the field so to let him escape away from you; but with
gentleness and courtesy ye might have brought him unto me to the Castle
of Maidens.’</p>
<p>Then the noble King Arthur went unto his knights and comforted them
in the best wise that he could, and said, ‘My fair fellows, be not
dismayed, howbeit ye have lost the field this day.’ And many were hurt
and sore wounded, and many were whole. ‘My fellows,’ said King Arthur,
‘look that ye be of good cheer, for to-morn I will be in the field with
you and revenge you of your enemies.’ So that night King Arthur and his
knights reposed themself.</p>
<p>The damosel that came from La Beale Isoud unto Sir Tristram, all the
while the tournament was adoing she was with Queen Guenever, and ever
the queen asked her for what cause she came into that country.</p>
<p>‘Madam,’ she answered, ‘I come for none other cause but from my lady
La Beale Isoud to wit of your welfare.’ For in no wise she would not
tell the queen that she came for Sir Tristram’s sake.</p>
<p>So this lady, Dame Bragwaine, took her leave of Queen Guenever, and
she rode after Sir Tristram. And as she rode through the forest she
heard a great cry; then she commanded her squire to go into the forest
to wit what was that noise.</p>
<p>And so he came to a well, and there he found a knight bounden till a
tree crying as he had been wood, and his horse and his harness standing
by him. And when he espied the squire, therewith he abrayed and brake
himself loose, and took his sword in his hand, and ran to have slain
that squire.</p>
<p>Then he took his horse and fled all that ever he might unto Dame
Bragwaine, and told her of his adventure. Then she rode unto Sir
Tristram’s pavilion, and told Sir Tristram what adventure she had found
in the forest.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘upon my head there is some good knight at
mischief.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram took his horse and his sword and rode thither;
there he heard how the knight complained unto himself and said:</p>
<p>‘I, woful knight Sir Palomides, what misadventure befalleth me, that
thus am defiled with falsehood and treason, through Sir Bors and Sir
Ector. Alas,’ he said, ‘why live I so long?’</p>
<p>And then he gat his sword in his hands, and made many strange signs
and tokens; and so through his raging he threw his sword into that
fountain. Then Sir Palomides wailed and wrang his hands. And at the last
for pure sorrow he ran into that fountain, over his belly, and sought
after his sword.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram saw that, and ran upon Sir Palomides, and held him
in his arms fast.</p>
<p>‘What art thou,’ said Palomides, ‘that holdeth me so?’</p>
<p>‘I am a man of this forest that would thee none harm.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Sir Palomides, ‘I may never win worship where Sir
Tristram is; for ever where he is and I be there, then get I no worship;
and if he be away for the most part I have the gree, unless that Sir
Launcelot be there or Sir Lamorak.’ Then Sir Palomides said, ‘Once in
Ireland Sir Tristram put me to the worse, and another time in Cornwall,
and in other places in this land.’</p>
<p>‘What would ye do,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘and ye had Sir Tristram?’</p>
<p>‘I would fight with him,’ said Sir Palomides, ‘and ease my heart upon
him; and yet, to say thee sooth, Sir Tristram is the gentlest knight in
this world living.’</p>
<p>‘What will ye do?’ said Sir Tristram, ‘Will ye go with me to your
lodging?’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said he, ‘I will go to the King with the Hundred Knights, for
he rescued me from Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Ector, and else had I been
slain traitorly.’</p>
<p>Sir Tristram said him such kind words that Sir Palomides went with
him to his lodging.</p>
<p>Then Gouvernail went tofore, and charged Dame Bragwaine to go out of
the way to her lodging. ‘And bid ye Sir Persides that he make him no
quarrels.’</p>
<p>And so they rode together till they came to Sir Tristram’s pavilion,
and there Sir Palomides had all the cheer that might be had all that
night. But in no wise Sir Palomides might not know what was Sir
Tristram; and so after supper they yede to rest, and Sir Tristram for
great travail slept till it was day.</p>
<p>And Sir Palomides might not sleep for anguish; and in the dawning of
the day he took his horse privily, and rode his way unto Sir Gaheris and
unto Sir Sagramore le Desirous, where they were in their pavilions; for
they three were fellows at the beginning of the tournament. And then
upon the morn the king blew unto the tournament upon the third day.</p>
