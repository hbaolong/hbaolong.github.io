<h4 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram departed from the king and La Beale lsoud out of
Ireland for to come into Cornwall</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Tristram, ‘now I shall tell you all the truth: my
father’s name is Sir Meliodas, King of Liones, and my mother hight
Elizabeth, that was sister unto King Mark of Cornwall; and my mother
died of me in the forest, and because thereof she commanded or she died
that when I were christened they should christen me Tristram; and
because I would not be known in this country I turned my name and let me
call Tramtrist; and for the truage of Cornwall I fought for my eme’s
sake, and for the right of Cornwall that ye had posseded many years. And
wit ye well,’ said Tristram unto the king, ‘I did the battle for the
love of mine uncle, King Mark, and for the love of the country of
Cornwall, and for to increase mine honour; for that same day that I
fought with Sir Marhaus I was made knight, and never or then did I
battle with no knight, and from me he went alive, and left his shield
and his sword behind.’</p>
<p>‘So God me help,’ said the king, ‘I may not say but ye did as a
knight should, and it was your part to do for your quarrel, and to
increase your worship as a knight should; how-beit I may not maintain
you in this country with my worship, unless that I should displease my
barons, and my wife and her kin.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Tristram, ‘I thank you of your good lordship that I have
had with you here, and the great goodness my lady, your daughter, hath
showed me, and therefore,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘it may so happen that ye
shall win more by my life than by my death, for in the parts of England
it may happen I may do you service at some season, that ye shall be glad
that ever ye showed me your good lordship. With more I promise you as I
am true knight, that in all places I shall be my lady, your daughter’s,
servant and knight in right and in wrong, and I shall never fail her to
do as much as a knight may do. Also I beseech your good grace that I may
take my leave at my lady, your daughter, and at all the barons and
knights.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said the king.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram went unto La Beale Isoud and took his leave of her.
And then he told her all, what he was, and how he had changed his name
because he would not be known, and how a lady told him that he1 should
never be whole till he came into this country where the poison was made,
‘where through I was near my death had not your ladyship been.’</p>
<p>‘O gentle knight,’ said La Beale Isoud, ‘full woe am I of thy
departing, for I saw never man that I ought so good will to.’ And
therewithal she wept heartily.</p>
<p>‘Madam,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘ye shall understand that my name is Sir
Tristram de Liones, gotten of King Meliodas, and born of his queen. And
I promise you faithfully that I shall be all the days of my life your
knight.’</p>
<p>‘Gramercy,’ said La Beale Isoud, ‘and I promise you there-against
that I shall not be married this seven years but by your assent; and to
whom that ye will I shall be married to, him will I have, and he will
have me if ye will consent.’</p>
<p>And then Sir Tristram gave her a ring, and she gave him another; and
therewith he departed from her, leaving her making great dole and
lamentation.</p>
<p>And he straight went unto the court among all the barons, and there
he took his leave at most and least, and openly he said among them all,
‘Fair lords, now it is so that I must depart. If there be any man here
that I have offended unto, or that any man be with me grieved, let
complain him here afore me or that ever I depart, and I shall amend it
unto my power. And if there be any that will proffer me wrong, or say of
me wrong or shame behind my back, say it now or never, and here is my
body to make it good, body against body.’</p>
<p>And all they stood still, there was not one that would say one word;
yet were there some knights that were of the queen’s blood, and of Sir
Marhaus’ blood, but they would not meddle with him.</p>
