<h4 id="chapter-20">Chapter 20</h4>
<p>How King Agwisance of Ireland was summoned to come to King Arthur’s
court for treason</p>
<p>Then it fell that Sir Bleoberis and Sir Blamor de Ganis, that were
brethren, they had assummoned the King Agwisance of Ireland for to come
to Arthur’s court upon pain of forfeiture of King Arthur’s good grace.
And if the King of Ireland came not in at the day assigned and set, the
king should lose his lands.</p>
<p>So by it happened that at the day assigned, King Arthur neither Sir
Launcelot might not be there for to give the judgement, for King Arthur
was with Sir Launcelot at the Castle Joyous Gard. And so King Arthur
assigned King Carados and the King of Scots to be there that day as
judges.</p>
<p>So when the kings were at Camelot King Agwisance of Ireland was come
to know his accusers. Then was there Blamor de Ganis, and appeled the
King of Ireland of treason, that he had slain a cousin of his in his
court in Ireland by treason.</p>
<p>The king was sore abashed of his accusation, for why he was come at
the summons of King Arthur, and or that he came at Camelot he wist not
wherefore he was sent after. And when the king heard Sir Blamor say his
will, he understood well there was none other remedy but to answer him
knightly, for the custom was such in those days, that and any man were
appeled of any treason or murder he should fight body for body, or else
to find another knight for him. And all manner of murderers in those
days were called treason. So when King Agwisance understood his accusing
he was passing heavy, for he knew Sir Blamor de Ganis that he was a
noble knight, and of noble knights comen. Then the King of Ireland was
simply purveyed of his answer; therefore the judges gave him respite by
the third day to give his answer. So the king departed unto his
lodging.</p>
<p>The meanwhile there came a lady by Sir Tristram’s pavilion making
great dole.</p>
<p>‘What aileth you,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘that ye make such dole?’</p>
<p>‘Ah, fair knight,’ said the lady, ‘I am ashamed unless that some good
knight help me; for a great lady of worship sent by me a fair shield and
a rich, unto Sir Launcelot du Lake, and hereby there met with me a
knight, and threw me down from my palfrey, and took away the shield from
me.’</p>
<p>‘Well, my lady,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘and for my lord Sir Launcelot’s
sake I shall get you that shield again, or else I shall be beaten for
it.’</p>
<p>And so Sir Tristram took his horse, and asked the lady which way the
knight rode; and then she told him. And he rode after him, and within a
while he overtook that knight. And then Sir Tristram bad him turn and
give again the shield.</p>
<p>appeled: accused.</p>
