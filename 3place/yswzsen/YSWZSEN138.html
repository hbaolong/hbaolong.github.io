<h4 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h4>
<p>How the knight yielded him, and how Beau-mains made him to go unto
King Arthur’s court, and to cry Sir Launcelot mercy</p>
<p>Then came there many earls, and barons, and noble knights, and prayed
that knight to save his life, ‘and take him to your prisoner.’ And all
they fell upon their knees, and prayed him of mercy, and that he would
save his life; ‘and, sir,’ they all said, ‘it were fairer of him to take
homage and fealty, and let him hold his lands of you than for to slay
him; by his death ye shall have none advantage, and his misdeeds that be
done may not be undone; and therefore he shall make amends to all
parties, and we all will become your men and do you homage and
fealty.’</p>
<p>‘Fair lords,’ said Beaumains, ‘wit you well I am full loth to slay
this knight, nevertheless he hath done passing ill and shamefully; but
insomuch all that he did was at a lady’s request I blame him the less;
and so for your sake I will release him that he shall have his life upon
this covenant, that he go within the castle, and yield him there to the
lady, and if she will forgive and quit him, I will well; with this he
make her amends of all the trespass he hath done against her and her
lands. And also, when that is done, that ye go unto the court of King
Arthur, and there that ye ask Sir Launcelot mercy, and Sir Gawain, for
the evil will ye have had against them.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the Red Knight of the Red Launds, ‘all this will I do as
ye command, and siker assurance and borows ye shall have.’</p>
<p>And so then when the assurance was made, he made his homage and
fealty, and all those earls and barons with him.</p>
<p>And then the maiden Lynet came to Sir Beaumains, and unarmed him and
searched his wounds, and stinted his blood, and in likewise she did to
the Red Knight of the Red Launds. And there they sojourned ten days in
their tents; and the Red Knight made his lords and servants to do all
the pleasure that they might unto Sir Beaumains.</p>
<p>And so within a while the Red Knight of the Red Launds yede unto the
castle, and put him in her grace. And so she received him upon
sufficient surety, so all her hurts were well restored of all that she
could complain. And then he departed unto the court of King Arthur, and
there openly the Red Knight of the Red Launds put him in the mercy of
Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawain, and there he told openly how he was
overcome and by whom, and also he told all the battles from the
beginning unto the ending.</p>
<p>‘Jesu mercy,’ said King Ardiur and Sir Gawain, ‘we marvel much of
what blood he is come, for he is a noble knight.’</p>
<p>‘Have ye no marvel,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘for ye shall right well wit
that he is comen of a full noble blood; and as for his might and
hardiness, there be but few now living that is so mighty as he is, and
so noble of prowess.’</p>
<p>‘It seemeth by you,’ said King Arthur, ‘that ye know his name, and
from whence he is come, and of what blood he is.’</p>
<p>‘I suppose I do so,’ said Launcelot, ‘or else I would not have given
him the order of knighthood; but he gave me such charge at that time
that I should never discover him until he required me, or else it be
known openly by some other.’</p>
<p>siker: sure. borows: pledges.</p>
