<h4 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h4>
<p>How Sir Launcelot came to the court and heard of La Cote Male Taile,
and how he followed after him, and how La Cote Male Taile was
prisoner</p>
<p>That when he was come to the court of King Arthur, then heard he tell
of the young knight La Cote Male Taile, how he slew the lion, and how he
took upon him the adventure of the black shield, the which was named at
that time the hardiest adventure of the world.</p>
<p>‘So God me save,’ said Sir Launcelot unto many of his fellows, ‘it
was shame to all the noble knights to suffer such a young knight to take
such adventure upon him for his destruction; for I will that ye wit,’
said Sir Launcelot, ‘that that Damosel Maledisant hath borne that shield
many a day for to seek the most proved knights, and that was she that
Breunis Saunce Pité took that shield from her, and after Tristram de
Liones rescued that shield from him and gave it to the damosel again, a
little afore that time that Sir Tristram fought with my nephew Sir
Blamor de Ganis, for a quarrel that was betwixt the King of Ireland and
him.’</p>
<p>Then many knights were sorry that Sir La Cote Male Taile was gone
forth to that adventure.</p>
<p>‘Truly,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘I cast me to ride after him.’</p>
<p>And within seven days Sir Launcelot overtook La Cote Male Taile, and
then he saluted him and the Damosel Maledisant. And when Sir Mordred saw
Sir Launcelot, then he left their fellowship; and so Sir Launcelot rode
with them all a day, and ever that damosel rebuked La Cote Male Taile,
and then Sir Launcelot answered for him; then she left off, and rebuked
Sir Launcelot.</p>
<p>So this meantime Sir Tristram sent by a damosel a letter unto Sir
Launcelot, excusing him of the wedding of Isoud la Blanche Mains; and
said in the letter, as he was a true knight he had never ado fleshly
with Isoud la Blanche Mains; and passing courteously and gently Sir
Tristram wrote unto Sir Launcelot, ever beseeching him to be his good
friend and unto La Beale Isoud of Cornwall, and that Sir Launcelot would
excuse him if that ever he saw her. And within short time, by the grace
of God, said Sir Tristram that he would speak with La Beale Isoud, and
with him right hastily.</p>
<p>Then Sir Launcelot departed from the damosel and from Sir La Cote
Male Taile, for to oversee that letter, and to write another letter unto
Sir Tristam de Liones.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile La Cote Male Taile rode with the damosel until
they came to a castle that hight Pendragon; and there were six knights
stood afore him, and one of them proffered to joust with La Cote Male
Taile.</p>
<p>And there La Cote Male Taile smote him over his horse’s croup. And
then the five knights set upon him all at once with their spears, and
there they smote La Cote Male Taile down, horse and man. And then they
alit suddenly, and set their hands upon him all at once, and took him
prisoner, and so led him unto the castle and kept him as prisoner.</p>
<p>And on the morn Sir Launcelot arose, and delivered the damosel with
letters unto Sir Tristram, and then he took his way after La Cote Male
Taile. And by the way upon a bridge there was a knight proffered Sir
Launcelot to joust, and Sir Launcelot smote him down, and then they
fought upon foot a noble battle together, and a mighty; and at the last
Sir Launcelot smote him down grovelling upon his hands and his knees.
And then that knight yielded him, and Sir Launcelot received him
fair.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the knight, ‘I require thee tell me your name, for much
my heart giveth unto you.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘as at this time I will not tell you my
name, unless then that ye tell me your name.’</p>
<p>‘Certainly,’ said the knight, ‘my name is Sir Nerovens, that was made
knight of my lord Sir Launcelot du Lake.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, Nerovens de Lile,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘I am right glad that ye
are proved a good knight, for now wit ye well my name is Sir Launcelot
du Lake.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Sir Nerovens de Lile, ‘what have I done!’</p>
<p>And therewithal flatling he fell to his feet, and would have kissed
them, but Sir Launcelot would not let him; and then either made great
joy of other.</p>
<p>And then Sir Nerovens told Sir Launcelot that he should not go by the
Castle of Pendragon: ‘For there is a lord, a mighty knight, and many
knights with him, and this night I heard say that they took a knight
prisoner yesterday that rode with a damosel, and they say he is a knight
of the Round Table.’</p>
