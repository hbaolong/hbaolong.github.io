<h4 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h4>
<p>How King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir Accolon of Gaul, chased an
hart, and of their marvellous adventure</p>
<p>Then it befell that Arthur and many of his knights rode on hunting
into a great forest, and it happed King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir
Accolon of Gaul, followed a great hart, for they three were well horsed,
and so they chased so fast that within a while they three were then ten
mile from their fellowship. And at the last they chased so sore that
they slew their horses underneath them. Then were they all three on
foot, and ever they saw the hart afore them passing weary and
ambushed.</p>
<p>‘What will we do?’ said King Arthur, ‘We are hard bestad.’</p>
<p>‘Let us go on foot,’ said King Uriens, ‘till we may meet with some
lodging.’</p>
<p>Then were they ware of the hart that lay on a great water bank, and a
brachet biting on his throat, and more other hounds came after. Then
King Arthur blew the prize and dight the hart.</p>
<p>Then the king looked about the world, and saw afore him in a great
water a little ship, all apparelled with silk down to the water, and the
ship came right unto them and landed on the sands. Then Arthur went to
the bank and looked in, and saw none earthly creature therein.</p>
<p>‘Sirs,’ said the king, ‘come thence, and let us see what is in this
ship.’</p>
<p>So they went in all three, and found it richly behanged with cloth of
silk. By then it was dark night, and there suddenly were about them an
hundred torches set upon all the sides of the ship boards, and it gave
great light; and therewithal there came out twelve fair damosels and
saluted King Arthur on their knees, and called him by his name, and said
he was right welcome, and such cheer as they had he should have of the
best. The king thanked them fair. Therewithal they led the king and his
two fellows into a fair chamber, and there was a cloth laid richly
beseen of all that longed unto a table, and there were they served of
all wines and meats that they could think; of that the king had great
marvel, for he fared never better in his life as for one supper.</p>
<p>And so when they had supped at their leisure, King Arthur was led
unto a chamber, a richer beseen chamber saw he never none, and so was
King Uriens served, and led into such another chamber, and Sir Accolon
was led into the third chamber passing richly and well beseen; and so
were they laid in their beds easily. And anon they fell asleep, and
slept marvellously sore all the night.</p>
<p>And on the morrow King Uriens was in Camelot abed in his wife’s arms,
Morgan le Fay. And when he awoke he had great marvel, how he came there,
for on the even afore he was two days’ journey from Camelot. And when
King Arthur awoke he found himself in a dark prison, hearing about him
many complaints of woeful knights.</p>
<p>hard bestad: hard pressed. prize: capture.</p>
