<h4 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h4>
<p>How La Cote Male Taile fought against an hundred knights, and how he
escaped by the mean of a lady</p>
<p>And anon there came an hundred knights about him and assailed him;
and when he saw his horse should be slain he alit and voided his horse,
and put the bridle under his feet, and so put him out of the gate. And
when he had so done he hurled in among them, and dressed his back unto a
lady’s chamber-wall, thinking himself that he had lever die there with
worship than to abide the rebukes of the Damosel Maledisant.</p>
<p>And in the meantime as he stood and fought, that lady whose was the
chamber went out slily at her postern, and without the gates she found
La Cote Male Taile’s horse, and lightly she gat him by the bridle, and
tied him to the postern.</p>
<p>And then she went unto her chamber slily again for to behold how that
one knight fought against an hundred knights. And when she had beheld
him long she went to a window behind his back, and said,</p>
<p>‘Thou knight, thou fightest wonderly well, but for all that at the
last thou must needs die, but and thou canst through thy mighty prowess
win unto yonder postern, for there have I fastened thy horse to abide
thee: but wit thou well thou must think on thy worship, and think not to
die, for thou mayst not win unto that postern without thou do nobly and
mightily.’</p>
<p>When La Cote Male Taile heard her say so he gripped his sword in his
hands, and put his shield fair afore him, and through the thickest press
he thrulled through them. And when he came to the postern he found there
ready four knights, and at two the first strokes he slew two of the
knights, and the other fled; and so he won his horse and rode from them.
And all as it was it was rehearsed in King Arthur’s court, how he slew
twelve knights within the Castle Orgulous; and so he rode on his
way.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile the damosel said to Sir Mordred, ‘I ween my
foolish knight be other slain or taken prisoner.’</p>
<p>Then were they ware where he came riding. And when he was come unto
them he told all how he had sped and escaped in despite of them all:
‘And some of the best of them will tell no tales.’</p>
<p>‘Thou liest falsely,’ said the damosel, ‘that dare I make good, but
as a fool and a dastard to all knighthood they have let thee pass.’</p>
<p>‘That may ye prove,’ said La Cote Male Taile.</p>
<p>With that she sent a courier of hers that rode alway with her for to
know the truth of this deed; and so he rode thither lightly, and asked
how and in what manner that La Cote Male Taile was escaped out of the
castle. Then all the knights cursed him, and said that he was a fiend
and no man: ‘for he hath slain here twelve of our best knights, and we
weened unto this day that it had been too much for Sir Launcelot du Lake
or for Sir Tristram de Liones. And in despite of us all he is departed
from us and maugre our heads.’</p>
<p>With this answer the courier departed and came to Maledisant his
lady, and told her all how Sir La Cote Male Taile had sped at the Castle
Orgulous. Then she smote down her head, and said little.</p>
<p>‘By my head,’ said Sir Mordred to the damosel, ‘ye are greatly to
blame so to rebuke him, for I warn you plainly he is a good knight, and
I doubt not but he shall prove a noble knight; but as yet he may not yet
sit sure on horseback, for he that shall be a good horseman it must come
of usage and exercise. But when he cometh to the strokes of his sword he
is then noble and mighty, and that saw Sir Bleoberis and Sir Palomides,
for wit ye well they are wily men of arms, and anon they know when they
see a young knight by his riding, how they are sure to give him a fall
from his horse or a great buffet. But for the most part they will not
light on foot with young knights, for they are wight and strongly armed.
For in likewise Sir Launcelot du Lake, when he was first made knight, he
was often put to the worse upon horseback, but ever upon foot he
recovered his renown, and slew and defiled many knights of the Round
Table. And therefore the rebukes that Sir Launcelot did unto many
knights causeth them that be men of prowess to beware; for often I have
seen the old proved knights rebuked and slain by them that were but
young beginners.’ Thus they rode sure talking by the way together.</p>
<p>Here leave we off a while of this tale, and speak we of Sir Launcelot
du Lake:</p>
<p>thrulled: pierced.</p>
