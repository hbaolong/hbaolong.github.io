<h4 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h4>
<p>How King Pellinor gat the lady and brought her to Camelot to the
court of King Arthur</p>
<p>And then he turned him to the other knight that was sore wounded. But
when he saw the other’s buffet, he would not fight, but kneeled down and
said, ‘Take my cousin the lady with you at your request, and I require
you, as ye be a true knight, put her to no shame nor villainy.’</p>
<p>‘What,’ said King Pellinor, ‘will ye not fight for her?’</p>
<p>‘No, sir,’ said the knight, ‘I will not fight with such a knight of
prowess as ye be.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Pellinor, ‘ye say well; I promise you she shall have no
villainy by me, as I am true knight. But now me lacketh an horse,’ said
Pellinor, ‘but I will have Hontzlake’s horse.’</p>
<p>‘Ye shall not need,’ said the knight, ‘for I shall give you such an
horse as shall please you, so that ye will lodge with me, for it is near
night.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said King Pellinor, ‘abide with you all night.’</p>
<p>And there he had with him right good cheer, and fared of the best
with passing good wine, and had merry rest that night. And on the morn
he heard a mass and dined; and then was brought him a fair bay courser,
and King Pellinor’s saddle set upon him.</p>
<p>‘Now, what shall I call you?’ said the knight, ‘inasmuch as ye have
my cousin at your desire of your quest.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, I shall tell you, my name is King Pellinor of the Isles and
knight of the Table Round.’</p>
<p>‘Now I am glad,’ said the knight, ‘that such a noble man shall have
the rule of my cousin.’</p>
<p>‘Now, what is your name?’ said Pellinor, ‘I pray you tell me.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, my name is Sir Meliot of Logris, and this lady my cousin hight
Nimue, and the knight that was in the other pavilion is my sworn
brother, a passing good knight, and his name is Brian of the Isles,1 and
he is full loth to do wrong, and full loth to fight with any man, but if
he be sore sought on, so that for shame he may not leave it.’</p>
<p>‘It is marvel,’ said Pellinor, ‘that he will not have ado with
me.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, he will not have ado with no man but if it be at his
request.’</p>
<p>‘Bring him to the court,’ said Pellinor, ‘one of these days.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, we will come together.’</p>
<p>‘And ye shall be welcome,’ said Pellinor, ‘to the court of King
Arthur, and greatly allowed for your coming.’</p>
<p>And so he departed with the lady, and brought her to Camelot. So as
they rode in a valley it was full of stones, and there the lady’s horse
stumbled and threw her down, that her arm was sore bruised and near she
swooned for pain.</p>
<p>‘Alas sir,’ said the lady, ‘mine arm is out of lith, wherethrough I
must needs rest me.’</p>
<p>‘Ye shall well,’ said King Pellinor. And so he alit under a fair tree
where was fair grass, and he put his horse thereto, and so laid him
under the tree and slept till it was nigh night. And when he awoke he
would have ridden.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the lady, ‘it is so dark that ye may as well ride
backward as forward.’</p>
<p>So they abode still and made there their lodging. Then Sir Pellinor
put off his armour; then a little afore midnight they heard the trotting
of an horse.</p>
<p>‘Be ye still,’ said King Pellinor, ‘for we shall hear of some
adventure.’</p>
<p>maugre her head: despite all she could do. keep: guard.</p>
