<h4 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h4>
<p>How Sir Launcelot rode with the damosel and slew a knight that
distressed all ladies and also a villain that kept a bridge</p>
<p>Now turn we unto Sir Launcelot, that rode with the damosel in a fair
highway.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the damosel, ‘here by this way haunteth a knight that
distressed all ladies and gentlewomen, and at the least he robbeth them
or lieth by them.’</p>
<p>‘What’, said Sir Launcelot, ‘is he a thief and a knight and a
ravisher of women? He doth shame unto the order of knighthood, and
contrary unto his oath; it is pity that he liveth. But, fair damosel, ye
shall ride on afore, yourself, and I will keep myself in covert, and if
that he trouble you or distress you I shall be your rescue and learn him
to be ruled as a knight.’</p>
<p>So the maid rode on by the way a soft ambling pace. And within a
while came out that knight on horseback out of the wood, and his page
with him, and there he put the damosel from her horse, and then she
cried.</p>
<p>With that came Launcelot as fast as he might till he came to that
knight, saying, ‘O thou false knight and traitor unto knighthood, who
did learn thee to distress ladies and gentlewomen?’</p>
<p>When the knight saw Sir Launcelot thus rebuking him he answered not,
but drew his sword and rode unto Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot threw
his spear from him, and drew out his sword, and struck him such a buffet
on the helmet that he clave his head and neck unto the throat.</p>
<p>‘Now hast thou thy payment that long thou hast deserved.’</p>
<p>‘That is truth,’ said the damosel. ‘For like as Sir Turquin watched
to destroy knights, so did this knight attend to destroy and distress
ladies, damosels, and gentlewomen, and his name was Sir Peris de Forest
Savage.’</p>
<p>‘Now, damosel,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘will ye any more service of
me?’</p>
<p>‘Nay, sir,’ she said, ‘at this time, but Almighty Jesu preserve you
wheresomever ye ride or go, for the courteoust knight thou art, and
meekest, unto all ladies and gentlewomen that now liveth. But one thing,
sir knight, methinketh ye lack, ye that are a knight wifeless, that ye
will not love some maiden or gentlewoman, for I could never hear say
that ever ye loved any of no manner degree, and that is greater pity;
but it is noised that ye love Queen Guenever, and that she hath ordained
by enchantment that ye shall never love none other but her, ne none
other damosel ne lady shall rejoice you; wherefore many in this land of
high estate and low make great sorrow.’</p>
<p>‘Fair damosel,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘I may not warn people to speak
of me what it pleaseth them; but for to be a wedded man, I think it not;
for then I must couch with her, and leave arms and tournaments, battles,
and adventures; and as for to say for to take my pleasance with
paramours, that will I refuse in principle for dread of God; for knights
that be adventurous or lecherous1 shall not be happy ne fortunate unto
the wars, for either they shall be overcome with a simpler knight than
they be themself, other else they shall by unhap and their cursedness
slay better men than they be themself. And so who that useth paramours
shall be unhappy, and all thing is unhappy that is about them.’</p>
<p>And so Sir Launcelot and she departed. And then he rode in a deep
forest two days and more, and had strait lodging. So on the third day he
rode over a long bridge, and there start upon him suddenly a passing
foul churl, and he smote his horse on the nose that he turned about, and
asked him why he rode over that bridge without his licence.</p>
<p>‘Why should I not ride this way?’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘I may not ride
beside.’</p>
<p>‘Thou shalt not choose,’ said the churl, and lashed at him with a
great club shod with iron.</p>
<p>Then Sir Launcelot drew his sword and put the stroke aback, and clave
his head unto the paps.</p>
<p>At the end of the bridge was a fair village, and all the people, men
and women, cried on Sir Launcelot, and said, ‘A worse deed didst thou
never for thyself, for thou hast slain the chief porter of our
castle.’</p>
<p>Sir Launcelot let them say what they would, and straight he went into
the castle; and when he came into the castle he alit, and tied his horse
to a ring on the wall, and there he saw a fair green court, and thither
he dressed him, for there him thought was a fair place to fight in. So
he looked about, and saw much people in doors and windows that said,
‘Fair knight, thou art unhappy.’</p>
