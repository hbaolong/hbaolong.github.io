<h4 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h4>
<p>How Sir Tor was made knight of the Round Table, and how Bagdemagus
was displeased</p>
<p>‘Now,’ said King Pellinor, ‘I shall put to you two knights, and ye
shall choose which is most worthy, that is Sir Bagdemagus, and Sir Tor,
my son. But because Sir Tor is my son I may not praise him, but else,
and he were not my son, I durst say that of his age there is not in this
land a better knight than he is, nor of better conditions and loth to do
any wrong, and loth to take any wrong.’</p>
<p>‘By my head,’ said Arthur, ‘he is a passing good knight as any ye
spake of this day, that wot I well,’ said the king, ‘for I have seen him
proved, but he sayeth little and he doth much more, for I know none in
all this court and he were as well born on his mother side as he is on
your side, that is like him of prowess and of might: and therefore I
will have him at this time, and leave Sir Bagdemagus till another
time.’</p>
<p>So when they were so chosen by the assent of all the barons, so were
there founden in their sieges every knights’ names that here are
rehearsed; and so were they set in their sieges, whereof Sir Bagdemagus
was wonderly wroth, that Sir Tor was advanced afore him, and therefore
suddenly he departed from the court, and took his squire with him, and
rode long in a forest till they came to a cross, and there alit and said
his prayers devoutly. The meanwhile his squire found written upon the
cross, that Bagdemagus should never return unto the court again, till he
had won a knight’s body of the Round Table, body for body.</p>
<p>‘Lo, sir,’ said his squire, ‘here I find writing of you, therefore I
rede you return again to the court.’</p>
<p>‘That shall I never,’ said Bagdemagus, ‘till men speak of me great
worship, and that I be worthy to be a knight of the Round Table.’</p>
<p>And so he rode forth, and there by the way he found a branch of an
holy herb that was the sign of the Sangrail,1 and no knight found such
tokens but he were a good liver.</p>
<p>So, as Sir Bagdemagus rode to see many adventures, it happed him to
come to the rock thereas the Lady of the Lake had put Merlin under the
stone, and there he heard him make great dole; whereof Sir Bagdemagus
would have holpen him, and went unto the great stone, and he was so
heavy that an hundred men might not lift it up. When Merlin wist he was
there, he bad leave his labour, for all was in vain, for he might never
be holpen but by her that put him there.</p>
<p>And so Bagdemagus departed and did many adventures, and proved after
a full good knight, and came again to the court and was made knight of
the Round Table.</p>
<p>So on the morn there fell new tidings and other adventures.</p>
