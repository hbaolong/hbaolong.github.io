<h4 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h4>
<p>How Sir Beaumains suffered great rebukes of the damosel, and he
suffered it patiently</p>
<p>‘Damosel,’ said Beaumains, ‘ye are uncourteous so to rebuke me as ye
do, for meseemeth I have done you good service, and ever ye threat me I
shall be beaten with knights that we meet, but ever for all your boast
they lie in the dust or in the mire, and therefore I pray you rebuke me
no more; and when ye see me beaten or yielden as recreant, then may ye
bid me go from you shamefully; but first I let you wit I will not depart
from you, for I were worse than a fool and I would depart from you all
the while that I win worship.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said she, ‘right soon there shall meet a knight shall pay
thee all thy wages, for he is the most man of worship of the world,
except King Arthur.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said Beaumains, ‘the more he is of worship, the more
shall be my worship to have ado with him.’</p>
<p>Then anon they were ware where was afore them a city rich and fair.
And betwixt them and the city a mile and an half there was a fair meadow
that seemed new mown, and therein were many pavilions fair to
behold.</p>
<p>‘Lo,’ said the damosel, ‘yonder is a lord that oweth yonder city, and
his custom is when the weather is fair to lie in this meadow to joust
and tourney. And ever there be about him five hundred knights and
gentlemen of arms, and there be all manner of games that any gentleman
can devise.’</p>
<p>‘That goodly lord,’ said Beaumains, ‘would I fain see,’</p>
<p>‘Thou shalt see him time enough,’ said the damosel, and so as she
rode near she espied the pavilion where he was. ‘Lo,’ said she, ‘seest
thou yonder pavilion that is all of the colour of Inde?’ And all manner
of thing that there is about, men and women, and horses trapped, shields
and spears were all of the colour of Inde, ‘And his name is Sir Persant
of Inde, the most lordliest knight that ever thou lookedst on.’</p>
<p>‘It may well be,’ said Beaumains, ‘but be he never so stout a knight,
in this field I shall abide till that I see him under his shield,’</p>
<p>‘Ah, fool,’ said she, ‘thou were better flee betimes.’</p>
<p>‘Why?’ said Beaumains, ‘and he be such a knight as ye make him, he
will not set upon me with all his men, or with his five hundred knights.
For and there come no more but one at once, I shall him not fail whilst
my life lasteth.’</p>
<p>‘Fie, fie,’ said the damosel, ‘that ever such a stinking knave should
blow such a boast.’</p>
<p>‘Damosel,’ he said, ‘ye are to blame so to rebuke me, for I had lever
do five battles than so to be rebuked, let him come and then let him do
his worst.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ she said, ‘I marvel what thou art and of what kin thou art
come; boldly thou speakest, and boldly thou hast done, that have I seen;
therefore I pray thee save thyself and thou mayest, for thy horse and
thou have had great travail, and I dread we dwell over long from the
siege, for it is but hence seven mile, and all perilous passages we are
passed save all only this passage; and here I dread me sore lest ye
shall catch some hurt, therefore I would ye were hence, that ye were not
bruised nor hurt with this strong knight. But I let you wit this Sir
Persant of Inde is nothing of might nor strength unto the knight that
laid the siege about my lady.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said Sir Beaumains, ‘be it as it be may. For sithen I
am come so nigh this knight I will prove his might or I depart from him,
and else I shall be shamed and I now withdraw me from him. And
therefore, damosel, have ye no doubt by the grace of God I shall so deal
with this knight that within two hours after noon I shall deliver him.
And then shall we come to the siege by daylight.’</p>
<p>‘O Jesu, marvel have I,’ said the damosel, ‘what manner a man ye be,
for it may never be otherwise but that ye be comen of a noble blood, for
so foul ne shamefully did never woman rule a knight as I have done you,
and ever courteously ye have suffered me, and that came never but of a
gentle blood.’</p>
<p>‘Damosel,’ said Beaumains, ‘a knight may little do that may not
suffer a damosel, for whatsomever ye said unto me I took none heed to
your words, for the more ye said the more ye angered me, and my wrath I
wreaked upon them that I had ado withal. And therefore all the missaying
that ye missaid me furthered me in my battle, and caused me to think to
show and prove myself at the end what I was; for peradventure though I
had meat in King Arthur’s kitchen, yet I might have had meat enough in
other places, but all that I did it for to prove and assay my friends,
and that shall be known another day; and whether that I be a gentleman
born or none, I let you wit, fair damosel, I have done you gentleman’s
service, and peradventure better service yet will I do or I depart from
you.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ she said, ‘fair Beaumains, forgive me all that I have missaid
or done against thee.’</p>
<p>‘With all my heart,’ said he, ‘I forgive it you, for ye did nothing
but as ye should do, for all your evil words pleased me; and damosel,’
said Beaumains, ‘since it liketh you to say thus fair unto me, wit ye
well it gladdeth my heart greatly, and now meseemeth there is no knight
living but I am able enough for him.’</p>
