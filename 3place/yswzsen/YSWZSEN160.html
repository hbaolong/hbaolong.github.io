<h4 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h4>
<p>How Tristram enterprized the battle to fight for the truage of
Cornwall, and how he was made knight</p>
<p>Therewithal Tristram went unto his father, King Meliodas, and asked
him counsel what was best to do for to recover Cornwall from truage.
‘For, as meseemeth,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘it were shame that Sir Marhaus,
the Queen’s brother of Ireland, should go away unless that he were
foughten withal.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said King Meliodas, ‘wit you well, son Tristram, that
Sir Marhaus is called one of the best knights of the world, and knight
of the Table Round; and therefore I know no knight in this country that
is able to match with him.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘that I am not made knight. And if Sir
Marhaus should thus depart into Ireland, God let me never have worship;
and I were made knight I should match him. And sir,’ said Tristram, ‘I
pray you give me leave to ride to King Mark; and so ye be not
displeased, of King Mark will I be made knight.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said King Meliodas, ‘that ye be ruled as your courage
will rule you.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram thanked his father much. And then he made him ready
to ride into Cornwall.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile there came a messenger with letters of love from
King Faramon of France’s daughter unto Sir Tristram, that were full
piteous letters, and in them were written many complaints of love; but
Sir Tristram had no joy of her letters not regard unto her. Also she
sent him a little brachet that was passing fair. But when the king’s
daughter understood that Sir Tristram would not love her, as the book
saith, she died for sorrow. And then the same squire that brought the
letter and the brachet came again unto Sir Tristram, as after ye shall
hear in the tale.</p>
<p>So this young Sir Tristram rode unto his eme King Mark of Cornwall.
And when he came there he heard say that there would no knight fight
with Sir Marhaus.</p>
<p>Then yede Sir Tristram unto his eme and said, ‘Sir, if ye will give
me the order of knighthood, I will do battle with Sir Marhaus.’</p>
<p>‘What are ye,’ said the king, ‘and from whence be ye comen?’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Tristram, ‘I come from King Meliodas that wedded your
sister, and a gentleman wit ye well I am.’</p>
<p>King Mark beheld Sir Tristram and saw that he was but a young man of
age, but he was passingly well made and big.</p>
<p>‘Fair sir,’ said the king, ‘what is your name, and where were ye
born?’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said he again, ‘my name is Tristram, and in the country of
Liones was I born.’</p>
<p>‘Ye say well,’ said the king; ‘and if ye will do this battle I shall
make you knight.’</p>
<p>‘Therefore I come to you,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘and for none other
cause.’</p>
<p>But then King Mark made him knight. And therewithal, anon as he had
made him knight, he sent a messenger unto Sir Marhaus with letters that
said that he had found a young knight ready for to take the battle to
the uttermost.</p>
<p>‘It may well be,’ said Sir Marhaus; ‘but tell King Mark I will not
fight with no knight but he be of blood royal, that is to say, other
king’s son, other queen’s son, born of a prince or princess.’</p>
<p>When King Mark understood that, he sent for Sir Tristram de Liones
and told him what was the answer of Sir Marhaus.</p>
<p>Then said Sir Tristram. ‘Sithen that he sayeth so, let him wit that I
am comen of father side and mother side of as noble blood as he is: for,
sir, now shall ye know that I am King Meliodas’ son, born of your own
sister, Dame Elizabeth, that died in the forest in the birth of me.’</p>
<p>‘O Jesu,’ said King Mark, ‘ye are welcome fair nephew to me.’</p>
<p>Then in all the haste the king let horse Sir Tristram, and arm him in
the best manner that might be had or gotten for gold or silver. And then
King Mark sent unto Sir Marhaus, and did him to wit that a better born
man than he was himself should fight with him, ‘and his name is Sir
Tristram de Liones, gotten of King Meliodas, and born of King Mark’s
sister.’ Then was Sir Marhaus glad and blithe that he should fight with
such a gentleman.</p>
<p>And so by the assent of King Mark and of Sir Marhaus they let ordain
that they should fight within an island nigh Sir Marhaus’ ships; and so
was Sir Tristram put into a vessel both his horse and he, and all that
to him longed both for his body and for his horse. Sir Tristram lacked
nothing. And when King Mark and his barons of Cornwall beheld how young
Sir Tristram departed with such a carriage to fight for the right of
Cornwall, there was neither man ne woman of worship but they wept to see
and understand so young a knight to jeopard himself for their right</p>
<p>eme: uncle.</p>
