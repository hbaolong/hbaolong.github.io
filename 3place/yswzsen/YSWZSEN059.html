<h4 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h4>
<p>How King Pellinor rode after the lady and the knight that led her
away, and how a lady desired help of him, and how he fought with two
knights for that lady, of whom he slew the one at the first stroke</p>
<p>Then King Pellinor armed him and mounted upon his horse, and rode
more than a pace after the lady that the knight led away. And as he rode
in a forest, he saw in a valley a damosel sit by a well, and a wounded
knight in her arms, and Pellinor saluted her.</p>
<p>And when she was ware of him, she cried overloud, ‘Help me, knight,
for Christ’s sake, King Pellinor.’</p>
<p>And he would not tarry, he was so eager in his quest, and ever she
cried an hundred times after help. When she saw he would not abide, she
prayed unto God to send him as much need of help as she had, and that he
might feel it or he died. So, as the book telleth, the knight there died
that there was wounded, wherefore the lady for pure sorrow slew herself
with his sword.</p>
<p>As King Pellinor rode in that valley he met with a poor man, a
labourer.</p>
<p>‘Sawest thou not,’ said Pellinor, ‘a knight riding and leading away a
lady?’</p>
<p>‘Yea,’ said the man, ‘I saw that knight, and the lady that made great
dole. And yonder beneath in a valley there shall ye see two pavilions,
and one of the knights of the pavilions challenged that lady of that
knight, and said she was his cousin near, wherefore he should lead her
no farther. And so they waged battle in that quarrel, the one said he
would have her by force, and the other said he would have the rule of
her, because he was her kinsman, and would lead her to her kin. For this
quarrel he left them fighting. And if ye will ride a pace ye shall find
them fighting, and the lady was beleft with the two squires in the
pavilions.’</p>
<p>‘God thank thee,’ said King Pellinor.</p>
<p>Then he rode a wallop till he had a sight of the two pavilions, and
the two knights fighting. Anon he rode unto the pavilions, and saw the
lady that was his quest, and said, ‘Fair lady, ye must go with me unto
the court of King Arthur.’</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ said the two squires that were with her, ‘yonder are
two knights that fight for this lady, go thither and depart them, and be
agreed with them, and then may ye have her at your pleasure.’</p>
<p>‘Ye say well,’ said King Pellinor.</p>
<p>And anon he rode betwixt them, and departed them, and asked them the
causes why that they fought.</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ said the one, ‘I shall tell you: this lady is my
kinswoman nigh, mine aunt’s daughter, and when I heard her complain that
she was with him maugre her head, I waged battle to fight with him.’</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ said the other, whose name was Hontzlake of Wentland,1
‘and this lady I gat by my prowess of arms this day at Arthur’s
court.’</p>
<p>‘That is untruly said,’ said King Pellinor, ‘for ye came in suddenly
there as we were at the high feast, and took away this lady or any man
might make him ready, and therefore it was my quest to bring her again
and you both, or else the one of us to abide in the field; therefore the
lady shall go with me, or I will die for it, for I have promised it King
Arthur. And therefore fight ye no more, for none of you shall have no
part of her at this time, and if ye list to fight for her, fight with
me, and I will defend her.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said the knights, ‘make you ready, and we shall assail you
will all our power.’</p>
<p>And as King Pellinor would have put his horse from them, Sir
Hontzlake rove his horse through with a sword, and said, ‘Now art thou
on foot as well as we are.’</p>
<p>When King Pellinor espied that his horse was slain, lightly he leapt
from his horse and pulled out his sword, and put his shield afore him,
and said, ‘Knight, keep well thy head, for thou shalt have a buffet for
the slaying of my horse.’</p>
<p>So King Pellinor gave him such a stroke upon the helm that he clave
the head down to the chin, that he fell to the earth dead.</p>
