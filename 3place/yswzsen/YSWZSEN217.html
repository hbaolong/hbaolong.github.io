<h4 id="chapter-21">Chapter 21</h4>
<p>How King Mark, by the advice of his council, banished Sir Tristram
out of Cornwall the term of ten year</p>
<p>Then the queen departed, but the brachet would not from him; and
therewithal came King Mark and the brachet set upon him, and bayed at
them all.</p>
<p>Therewithal Sir Andred spake and said, ‘Sir, this is Sir Tristram, I
see by the brachet.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said the king, ‘I cannot suppose that.’ Then the king asked
him upon his faith what he was, and what was his name.</p>
<p>‘So God me help,’ said he, ‘my name is Sir Tristram de Liones; now do
by me what ye list.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said King Mark, ‘me repenteth of your recovery.’ And then he
let call his barons to judge Sir Tristram to the death.</p>
<p>Then many of his barons would not assent thereto, and in especial Sir
Dinas, the Seneschal, and Sir Fergus. And so by the advice of them all
Sir Tristram was banished out of the country for ten year, and thereupon
he took his oath upon a book before the king and his barons. And so he
was made to depart out of the country of Cornwall; and there were many
barons brought him unto his ship, of the which some were his friends and
some his foes.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile there came a knight of King Arthur’s, his name
was Dinadan, and his coming was for to seek after Sir Tristram; then
they showed him where he was armed at all points going to the ship.</p>
<p>‘Now fair knight,’ said Sir Dinadan, ‘or ye pass this court that ye
will joust with me I require thee.’</p>
<p>‘With a good will,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘and these lords will give me
leave.’</p>
<p>Then the barons granted thereto, and so they ran together, and there
Sir Tristram gave Sir Dinadan a fall. And then he prayed Sir Tristram to
give him leave to go in his fellowship.</p>
<p>‘Ye shall be right welcome,’ said then Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>And so they took their horses and rode to their ships, together, and
when Sir Tristram was in the sea he said,</p>
<p>‘Greet well King Mark and all mine enemies, and say them I will come
again when I may; and well am I rewarded for the fighting with Sir
Marhaus, and delivered all this country from servage; and well am I
rewarded for the fetching and costs of Queen Isoud out of Ireland, and
the danger that I was in first and last, and by the way coming home what
danger I had to bring again Queen Isoud from the Castle Pluere; and well
I am rewarded when I fought with Sir Bleoberis for Sir Segwarides’ wife;
and well am I rewarded when I fought with Sir Blamor de Ganis for King
Agwisance, father unto La Beale Isoud; and well am I rewarded when I
smote down the good knight, Sir Lamorak de Gales, at King Mark’s
request; and well am I rewarded when I fought with the King with the
Hundred Knights, and the King of Northgales, and both these would have
put his land in servage, and by me they were put to a rebuke; and well I
am rewarded for the slaying of Tawleas, the mighty giant, and many other
deeds have I done for him, and now have I my warison. And tell King Mark
that many noble knights of the Table Round have spared the barons of
this country for my sake. Also am I not well rewarded when I fought with
the good knight Sir Palomides and rescued Queen Isoud from him; and at
that time King Mark said afore all his barons I should have been better
rewarded.’</p>
<p>And forthwithal he took the sea.</p>
<p>warison: reward.</p>
