<h4 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h4>
<p>How Merlin counselled King Arthur to send for King Ban and King Bors,
and of their counsel taken for the war</p>
<p>So after the feast and journey, King Arthur drew him unto London, and
so by the counsel of Merlin, the king let call his barons to council,
for Merlin had told the king that the six kings that made war upon him
would in all haste be awroke on him and on his lands. Wherefore the king
asked counsel at them all. They could no counsel give, but said they
were big enough.</p>
<p>‘Ye say well,’ said Arthur; ‘I thank you for your good courage, but
will ye all that loveth me speak with Merlin? Ye know well that he hath
done much for me, and he knoweth many things, and when he is afore you,
I would that ye prayed him heartily of his best advice.’ All the barons
said they would pray him and desire him. So Merlin was sent for, and
fair desired of all the barons to give them best counsel.</p>
<p>‘I shall say you,’ said Merlin, ‘I warn you all, your enemies are
passing strong for you, and they are good men of arms as be alive, and
by this time they have gotten to them four kings more and a mighty duke;
and unless that our king have more chivalry with him than he may make
within the bounds of his own realm, and he fight with them in battle, he
shall be overcome and slain.’</p>
<p>‘What were best to do in this case?’ said all the barons.</p>
<p>‘I shall tell you,’ said Merlin, ‘mine advice: there are two brethren
beyond the sea, and they be kings both and marvellous good men of their
hands; and that one hight King Ban of Benwick, and that other hight King
Bors of Gaul, that is France. And on these two kings warreth a mighty
man of men, the King Claudas, and striveth with them for a castle, and
great war is betwixt them; but this Claudas is so mighty of goods
whereof he getteth good knights, that he putteth these two kings most
part to1 the worse; wherefore this is my counsel: that our king and
sovereign lord send unto the kings Ban and Bors by two trusty knights
with letters well devised, that and they will come and see King Arthur
and his court, and so help him in his wars, that he will be sworn unto
them to help them in their wars against King Claudas. Now, what say ye
unto this counsel?’ said Merlin.</p>
<p>‘This is well counselled,’ said the king and all the barons. Right so
in all haste there were ordained to go two knights on the message unto
the two kings. So were there made letters in the pleasant wise according
unto King Arthur’s desire.</p>
<p>Ulfius and Brastias were made the messengers, and so rode forth well
horsed and well armed, and as the guise was that time, and so passed the
sea and rode toward the city of Benwick. And there besides were eight
knights that espied them, and at a strait passage they met with Ulfius
and Brastias, and would have taken them prisoners; so they prayed them
that they might pass, for they were messengers unto King Ban and Bors
sent from King Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Therefore,’ said the eight knights, ‘ye shall the or be prisoners,
for we be knights of King Claudas.’ And therewith two of them dressed
their spears, and Ulfius and Brastias dressed their spears and ran
together with great raundon and Claudas’ knights brake their spears, and
there to-held and bare the two knights out of their saddles to the
earth, and so left them lying, and rode their ways. And the other six
knights rode afore to a passage to meet with them again, and so Ulfius
and Brastias smote other two down, and so passed on their ways. And at
the fourth passage there met two for two, and both were laid unto the
earth; so there was none of the eight knights but he was sore hurt or
bruised.</p>
<p>And when they come to Benwick it fortuned there were both kings, Ban
and Bors. And when it was told the kings that there were come
messengers, there were sent unto them two knights of worship, the one
hight Lionses, lord of the country of Payarne, and Sir Phariance, a
worshipful knight. Anon they asked from whence they came, and they said
from King Arthur, king of England; so they took them in their arms and
made great joy each of other. But anon, as the two kings wist they were
messengers of Arthur’s, there was made no tarrying, but forthwith they
spake with the knights, and welcomed them in the faithfullest wise, and
said they were most welcome unto them before all the kings living. And
therewith they kissed the letters and delivered them; and when Ban and
Bors understood the letters, then they were more welcome than they were
before.</p>
<p>And after the haste of the letters, they gave them this answer, that
they would fulfil the desire of King Arthur’s writing, and Ulfius and
Brastias tarry there as long as they would, they should have such cheer
as might be made them in those marches. Then Ulfius and Brastias told
the king of the adventure at their passages of the eight knights.</p>
<p>‘Ha! ah!’ said Ban and Bors, ‘they were my good friends. I would I
had wist of them, they should not have escaped so.’</p>
<p>So Ulfius and Brastias had good cheer and great gifts as much as they
might bear away, and had their answer by mouth and by writing, that
those two kings would come unto Arthur in all the haste that they
might.</p>
<p>So the two knights rode on afore, and passed the sea, and come to
their lord, and told him how they had sped, whereof King Arthur was
passing glad.</p>
<p>‘At what time suppose ye the two kings will be here?’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said they, ‘afore All Hallowmass.’</p>
<p>Then the king let purvey for a great feast, and let cry a great
jousts. And by All Hallowmass the two kings were come over the sea with
three hundred knights well arrayed both for the peace and for the war.
And King Arthur met with them ten mile out of London, and there was
great joy as could be thought or made.</p>
<p>And on All Hallowmass at the great feast, sat in the hall the three
kings, and Sir Kay Seneschal served in the hall, and Sir Lucan the
Butler, that was Duke Corneus’ son, and Sir Griflet, that was the son of
Cardol; these three knights had the rule of all the service that served
the kings. And anon, as they had washen and risen, all knights that
would joust made them ready. By then they were ready on horseback there
were seven hundred knights. And Arthur, Ban, and Bors, with the
Archbishop of Canterbury, and Sir Ector, Kay’s father, they were in a
place covered with cloth of gold like an hall, with ladies and
gentlewomen, for to behold who did best, and thereon to give
judgement.</p>
