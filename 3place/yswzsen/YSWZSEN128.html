<h4 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h4>
<p>How the brother of the knight that was slain met with Beaumains, and
fought with Beaumains till he was yielden</p>
<p>Thus as they rode together, they saw a knight come driving by them
all in green, both his horse and his harness; and when he came nigh the
damosel, he asked her, ‘Is that my brother the Black Knight that ye have
brought with you?’</p>
<p>‘Nay, nay,’ she said, ‘this unhappy kitchen knave hath slain your
brother through unhappiness.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said the Green Knight, ‘that is great pity, that so noble a
knight as he was should so unhaply be slain, and, namely of a knave’s
hand, as ye say that he is. Ah! traitor,’ said the Green Knight, ‘thou
shalt die for slaying of my brother; he was a full noble knight, and his
name was Sir Percard.’</p>
<p>‘I defy thee,’ said Beaumains, ‘for I let thee wit I slew him
knightly and not shamefully.’</p>
<p>Therewithal the Green Knight rode unto an horn that was green, and it
hung upon a thorn, and there he blew three deadly motes, and there came
two damosels and armed him lightly. And then he took a great horse, and
a green shield and a green spear.</p>
<p>And then they ran together with all their mights, and brake their
spears unto their hands. And then they drew their swords, and gave many
sad strokes, and either of them wounded other full ill. And at the last
at an overthwart Beaumains with his horse struck the Green Knight’s
horse upon the side, that he fell to the earth. And then the Green
Knight avoided his horse lightly, and dressed him upon foot. That saw
Beaumains, and therewithal he alit, and they rashed together like two
mighty kemps a long while, and sore they bled both.</p>
<p>With that came the damosel, and said, ‘My lord the Green Knight, why
for shame stand ye so long fighting with the kitchen knave? Alas, it is
shame that ever ye were made knight, to see such a lad to match such a
knight, as the weed overgrew the corn.’</p>
<p>Therewith the Green Knight was ashamed, and therewithal he gave a
great stroke of might, and clave his shield through. When Beaumains saw
his shield cloven asunder he was a little ashamed of that stroke and of
her language; and then he gave him such a buffet upon the helm that he
fell on his knees. And so suddenly Beaumains pulled him upon the ground
grovelling. And then the Green Knight cried him mercy, and yielded him
unto Sir Beaumains, and prayed him to slay him not.</p>
<p>‘All is in vain,’ said Beaumains, ‘for thou shalt die but if this
damosel that came with me pray me to save thy life.’ And therewithal he
unlaced his helm like as he would slay him.</p>
<p>‘Fie upon thee, false kitchen page, I will never pray thee to save
his life, for I will never be so much in thy danger.’</p>
<p>‘Then shall he die,’ said Beaumains.</p>
<p>‘Not so hardy, thou bawdy knave,’ said the damosel, ‘that thou slay
him.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said the Green Knight, ‘suffer me not to die for a fair word
may save me. Fair knight,’ said the Green Knight, ‘save my life, and I
will forgive thee the death of my brother, and for ever to become thy
man, and thirty knights that hold of me for ever shall do you
service.’</p>
<p>‘In the devil’s name,’ said the damosel, ‘that such a bawdy kitchen
knave should have thee and thirty knights’ service.’</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ said Beaumains, ‘all this availeth thee not, but if my
damosel speak with me for thy life,’ And therewithal he made a semblant
to slay him.</p>
<p>‘Let be,’ said the damosel, ‘thou bawdy knave; slay him not, for and
thou do thou shalt repent it.’</p>
<p>‘Damosel,’ said Beaumains, ‘your charge is to me a pleasure, and at
your commandment his life shall be saved, and else not,’ Then he said,
‘Sir knight with the green arms, I release thee quit at this damosel’s
request, for I will not make her wroth, I will fulfil all that she
chargeth me.’</p>
<p>And then the Green Knight kneeled down, and did him homage with his
sword.</p>
<p>Then said the damosel, ‘Me repenteth, Green Knight, of your damage
and of your brother’s death, the Black Knight, for of your help I had
great mister, for I dread me sore to pass this forest.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, dread you not,’ said the Green Knight, ‘for ye shall lodge with
me this night, and to-morn I shall help you through this forest.’</p>
<p>So they took their horses and rode to his manor, which was fast there
beside.</p>
<p>motes notes, kemps: warriors.</p>
<p>in thy danger: under an obligation to you.</p>
