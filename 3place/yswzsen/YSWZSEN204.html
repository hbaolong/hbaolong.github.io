<h4 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h4>
<p>How La Cote Male Taile was taken prisoner, and after rescued by Sir
Launcelot, and how Sir Launcelot overcame four brethren</p>
<p>This meanwhile Sir La Cote Male Taile sank right down upon the earth,
what forwounded and what forbled he might not stand. Then the other
knight had pity of him, and said,</p>
<p>‘Fair young knight, dismay you not, for had ye been fresh when ye met
with me, as I was, I wot well that I should not have endured so long as
ye have done; and therefore for your noble deeds of arms I shall show to
you kindness and gentleness in all that I may.’</p>
<p>And forthwithal this noble knight, Sir Plenorius, took him up in his
arms, and led him into his tower. And then he commanded him the wine,
and made to search him and to stop his bleeding wounds.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said La Cote Male Taile, ‘withdraw you from me, and hie you to
yonder bridge again, for there will meet with you another manner knight
than ever was I.’</p>
<p>‘Why,’ said Plenorius, ‘is there another manner knight behind of your
fellowship?’</p>
<p>‘Yea,’ said La Cote Male Taile, ‘there is a much better knight than I
am.’</p>
<p>‘What is his name?’ said Plenorius.</p>
<p>‘Ye shall not know for me,’ said La Cote Male Taile.</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said the knight, ‘he shall be encountered withal whatsomever
he be.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Plenorius heard a knight call that said, ‘Sir Plenorius,
where art thou? Other thou must deliver me the prisoner that thou hast
led unto thy tower, or else come and do battle with me.’</p>
<p>Then Plenorius gat his horse, and came with a spear in his hand
walloping toward Sir Launcelot; and then they began to fewter their
spears, and came together as thunder, and smote either other so mightily
that their horses fell down under them.</p>
<p>And then they avoided their horses, and pulled out their swords, and
like two bulls they lashed together with great strokes and foins; but
ever Sir Launcelot recovered ground upon him, and Sir Plenorius traced
to have gone about him. But Sir Launcelot would not suffer that, but
bare him backer and backer, till he came nigh his tower gate.</p>
<p>And then said Sir Launcelot, ‘I know thee well for a good knight, but
wit thou well thy life and death is in my hand, and therefore yield thee
to me, and thy prisoner.’</p>
<p>The other answered no word, but struck mightily upon Sir Launcelot’s
helm, that the fire sprang out of his eyen. Then Sir Launcelot doubled
his strokes so thick, and smote at him so mightily, that he made him
kneel upon his knees. And therewith Sir Launcelot leapt upon him, and
pulled him grovelling down.</p>
<p>Then Sir Plenorius yielded him, and his tower, and all his prisoners
at his will. Then Sir Launcelot received him and took his troth.</p>
<p>And then he rode to the other bridge, and there Sir Launcelot jousted
with other three of his brethren, the one hight Pillounes, and the other
hight Pellogris, and the third Sir Pellandris. And first upon horseback
Sir Launcelot smote them down, and afterward he beat them on foot, and
made them to yield them unto him. And then he returned unto Sir
Plenorius, and there he found in his prison King Carados of Scotland,
and many other knights, and all they were delivered.</p>
<p>And then Sir La Cote Male Taile came to Sir Launcelot, and then Sir
Launcelot would have given him all these fortresses and these
bridges.</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said La Cote Male Taile, ‘I will not have Sir Plenorius’
livelihood. With that he will grant you, my lord Sir Launcelot, to come
unto King Arthur’s court, and to be his knight, and all his brethren, I
will pray you my lord, to let him have his livelihood.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘with this, that he will come to
the court of King Arthur and become his man, and his brethren five. And
as for you, Sir Plenorius, I will undertake,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘at
the next feast, so there be a place voided, that ye shall be knight of
the Round Table.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Plenorius, ‘at the next feast of Pentecost I will be at
Arthur’s court, and at that time I will be guided and ruled as King
Arthur and ye will have me.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Launcelot and Sir La Cote Male Taile reposed them there,
unto the time that Sir La Cote Male Taile was whole of his wounds, and
there they had merry cheer, and good rest, and many good games, and
there were many fair ladies.</p>
