<h4 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h4>
<p>How Arthur accorded the two brethren, and delivered the twenty
knights, and how Sir Accolon died</p>
<p>Then all the people fell down on their knees and cried King Arthur
mercy.</p>
<p>‘Mercy shall ye have,’ said Arthur. ’Here may ye see what adventures
befallen ofttime of errant knights, how that I have foughten with a
knight of mine own unto my great damage and his both. But sirs, because
I am sore hurt, and he both, and I had great need of a little rest, ye
shall understand the opinion betwixt you two brethren:</p>
<p>‘As to thee, Sir Damas, for whom I have been champion and won the
field of this knight, yet will I judge because ye, Sir Damas, are called
an orgulous knight, and full of villainy, and not worth of prowess of
your deeds, therefore I will that ye give unto your brother all the
whole manor with the appurtenance, under this form, that Sir
Ontzlakehold the manor of you, and yearly to give you a palfry to ride
upon, for that will become you better to ride on than upon a courser.
Also I charge thee, Sir Damas, upon pain of death, that thou never
distress no knights errant that ride on their adventure. And also that
thou restore these twenty knights that thou hast long kept prisoners, of
all their harness, that they be content for; and if any of them come to
my court and complain of thee, by my head thou shalt die therefore.
Also, Sir Ontzlake, as to you, because ye are named a good knight, and
full of prowess, and true and gentle in all your deeds, this shall be
your charge. I will give you that in all goodly haste ye come unto me
and my court, and ye shall be a knight of mine, and if your deeds be
thereafter I shall so prefer you, by the grace of God, that ye shall in
short time be in ease for to live as worshipfully as your brother Sir
Damas.’</p>
<p>‘God thank your largeness of your goodness and of your bounty, I
shall be from henceforward at all times at your commandment; for, sir,’
said Sir Ontzlake, ‘as God would, as I was hurt but late with an
adventurous knight through both my thighs, that grieved me sore, and
else had I done this battle with you.’</p>
<p>‘God would,’ said Arthur, ‘it had been so, for then had not I been
hurt as I am. I shall tell you the cause why: for I had not been hurt as
I am, had not been mine own sword, that was stolen from me by treason;
and this battle was ordained aforehand to have slain me, and so it was
brought to the purpose by false treason, and by false enchantment.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Sir Ontzlake, ‘that is a great pity that ever so noble a
man as ye are of your deeds and prowess, that any man or woman might
find in their hearts to work any treason against you.’</p>
<p>‘I shall reward them,’ said Arthur, ‘in short time, by the grace of
God. Now, tell me,’ said Arthur, ‘how far am I from Camelot?’</p>
<p>‘Sir, ye are two days’ journey therefrom.’</p>
<p>‘I would fain be at some place of worship,’ said Sir Arthur, ‘that I
might rest me.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Ontzlake, ‘hereby is a rich abbey of your elders’
foundation, of nuns, but three mile hence.’</p>
<p>So the king took his leave of all the people, and mounted upon
horseback, and Sir Accolon with him. And when they were come to the
abbey, he let fetch leeches and search his wounds and Accolon’s both;
but Sir Accolon died within four days, for he had bled so much blood
that he might not live, but King Arthur was well recovered.</p>
<p>So when Accolon was dead he let send him on an horse-bier with six
knights unto Camelot, and said, ‘Bear him to my sister Morgan le Fay,
and say that I send her him to a present, and tell her I have my sword
Excalibur and the scabbard.’</p>
<p>So they departed with the body.</p>
<p>wit: blame, our alther: of us all.</p>
