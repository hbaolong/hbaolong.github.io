<h4 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h4>
<p>How the lady forsook Sir Tristram and abode with Sir Bleoberis, and
how she desired to go to her husband</p>
<p>So when she was set betwixt them both she said these words unto Sir
Tristram:</p>
<p>‘Wit ye well, Sir Tristram de Liones, that but late thou was the man
in the world that I most loved and trusted, and I weened thou hadst
loved me again above all ladies; but when thou sawest this knight lead
me away thou madest no cheer to rescue me, but suffered my lord
Segwarides ride after me; but until that time I weened thou haddest
loved me, and therefore now I will leave thee, and never love thee
more.’</p>
<p>And therewithal she went unto Sir Bleoberis. When Sir Tristram saw
her do so he was wonderly wroth with that lady, and ashamed to come to
the court.</p>
<p>‘Sir Tristram,’ said Sir Bleoberis, ‘ye are in the default for I hear
by these lady’s words she before this day trusted you above all earthly
knights, and, as she sayeth, ye have deceived her, therefore wit ye
well, there may no man hold that will away; and rather than ye should be
heartily displeased with me I would ye had her, and she would abide with
you.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said the lady, ‘So God me help I will never go with him; for
he that I loved most I weened he had loved me. And therefore, Sir
Tristram,’ she said, ‘ride as thou came, for though thou haddest
overcome this knight, as ye was likely, with thee never would I have
gone. And I shall pray this knight so fair of his knighthood, that or
ever he pass this country that he will lead me to the abbey there my
lord Sir Segwarides lieth.’</p>
<p>‘So God me help,’ said Bleoberis, ‘I let you wit, good knight Sir
Tristram, because King Mark gave me the choice of a gift in this court,
and so this lady liked me best, notwithstanding she is wedded and hath a
lord, and I have fulfilled my quest, she shall be sent unto her husband
again, and in especial most for your sake, Sir Tristram; and if she
would go with you I would ye had her.’</p>
<p>‘I thank you,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘but for her love I shall beware
what manner a lady I shall love or trust; for had her lord, Sir
Segwarides been away from the court, I should have been the first that
should have followed you; but sithen ye have refused me, as I am true
knight I shall her know passingly well that I shall love or trust’</p>
<p>And so they took their leave one from the other and departed. And so
Sir Tristram rode unto Tintagel, and Sir Bleoberis rode unto the abbey
where Sir Segwarides lay sore wounded, and there he delivered his lady,
and departed as a noble knight. And when Sir Segwarides saw his lady, he
was greatly comforted; and then she told him that Sir Tristram had done
great battle with Sir Bleoberis, and caused him to bring her again.
These words pleased Sir Segwarides right well, that Sir Tristram would
do so much; and so that lady told all the battle unto King Mark betwixt
Sir Tristram and Sir Bleoberis.</p>
