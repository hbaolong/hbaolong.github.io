<h4 id="chapter-16">Chapter 16</h4>
<p>16: How Sir Launcelot at the request of a lady recovered a falcon, by
which he was deceived</p>
<p>And so Sir Launcelot rode through many strange countries, over marsh
and valleys, till by fortune he came to a fair castle, and as he passed
beyond the castle him thought he heard two bells ring.</p>
<p>And then was he ware of a falcon came flying over his head towards an
high elm, and long lunes about her feet, and she flew unto the elm to
take her perch. The lunes overcast about a bough, and when she would
have taken her flight she hung by the legs fast; and Sir Launcelot saw
how she hung, and beheld the fair falcon perigot, and he was sorry for
her.</p>
<p>The meanwhile came a lady out of the castle and cried on high, ‘O
Launcelot, Launcelot, as thou art flower of all knights, help me to get
my hawk, for and my hawk be lost my lord will destroy me; for I kept the
hawk and she slipped from me, and if my lord my husband wit it he is so
hasty that he will slay me.’</p>
<p>‘What is your lord’s name?’ said Sir Launcelot.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ she said, ‘his name is Sir Phelot, a knight that longeth unto
the King of Northgales.’</p>
<p>‘Well, fair lady, since that ye know my name, and require me of
knighthood to help you, I will do what I may to get your hawk, and yet
God knoweth I am an ill climber, and the tree is passing high, and few
boughs to help me withal.’</p>
<p>And therewith Sir Launcelot alit, and tied his horse to the same
tree, and prayed the lady to unarm him. And so when he was unarmed, he
put off all his clothes unto his shirt and breech, and with might and
force he clomb up to the falcon, and tied the lunes to a great rotten
bush, and threw the hawk down and it withal.</p>
<p>Anon the lady gat the hawk in her hand; and therewithal came out Sir
Phelot out of the groves suddenly, that was her husband, all armed and
with his naked sword in his hand, and said: ‘O knight Launcelot, now
have I found thee as I would.’ and stood at the bole of the tree to slay
him.</p>
<p>‘Ah, lady,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘why have ye betrayed me?’</p>
<p>‘She hath done,’ said Sir Phelot, ‘but as I commanded her, and
therefore there nis none other boot but thine hour is come that thou
must die.’</p>
<p>‘That were shame unto thee.’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘thou an armed
knight to slay a naked man by treason.’</p>
<p>‘Thou gettest none other grace,’ said Sir Phelot, ‘and therefore help
thyself and thou canst.’</p>
<p>‘Truly,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘that shall be thy shame, but since thou
wilt do none other, take mine harness with thee, and hang my sword upon
a bough that I may get it, and then do thy best to slay me and thou
canst.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, nay,’ said Sir Phelot, ‘for I know thee better than thou
weenest, therefore thou gettest no weapon and I may keep you
therefrom.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘that ever a knight should the
weaponless.’</p>
<p>And therewith he waited above him and under him, and over his head he
saw a rownsepyk,1 a big bough leafless, and therewith he brake it off by
the body. And then he came lower and awaited how his own horse stood,
and suddenly he leapt on the further side of the horse, froward the
knight.</p>
<p>And then Sir Phelot lashed at him eagerly, weening to have slain him.
But Sir Launcelot put away the stroke with the rownsepyk, and therewith
he smote him on the one side of the head, that he fell down in a swoon
to the ground. So then Sir Launcelot took his sword out of his hand, and
struck his neck from the body.</p>
<p>Then cried the lady, ‘Alas! why hast thou slain my husband?’</p>
<p>‘I am not causer,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘for with falsehood ye would
have slain me with treason, and now it is fallen on you both.’</p>
<p>And then she swooned as though she would die. And therewithal Sir
Launcelot gat all his armour as well as he might, and put it upon him
for dread of more resort, for he dread that the knight’s castle was so
nigh. And so as soon as he might he took his horse and departed, and
thanked God that he had escaped that adventure.</p>
<p>lunes: leashes.</p>
<p>boot: remedy.</p>
