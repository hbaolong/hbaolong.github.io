<h4 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h4>
<p>How four queens found Launcelot sleeping, and how by enchantment he
was taken and led into a castle</p>
<p>Now leave we these knights prisoners, and speak we of Sir Launcelot
du Lake that lieth under the apple tree sleeping. Even about the noon
there come by him four queens of great estate; and, for the heat should
not nigh them, there rode four knights about them, and bare a cloth of
green silk on four spears, betwixt them and the sun, and the queens rode
on four white mules.</p>
<p>Thus as they rode they heard by them a great horse grimly neigh, then
were they ware of a sleeping knight, that lay all armed under an apple
tree; anon as these queens looked on his face, they knew it was Sir
Launcelot. Then they began for to strive for that knight, every each one
said they would have him to her love.</p>
<p>‘We shall not strive,’ said Morgan le Fay, that was King Arthur’s
sister, ‘I shall put an enchantment upon him that he shall not awake in
six hours, and then I will lead him away unto my castle, and when he is
surely within my hold, I shall take the enchantment from him, and then
let him choose which of us he will have unto paramour.’</p>
<p>So this enchantment was cast upon Sir Launcelot, and then they laid
him upon his shield, and bare him so on horseback betwixt two knights,
and brought him unto the castle Chariot, and there they laid him in a
chamber cold, and at night they sent unto him a fair damosel with his
supper ready dight. By that the enchantment was past, and when she came
she saluted him, and asked him what cheer.</p>
<p>‘I cannot say, fair damosel’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘for I wot not how I
came into this castle but it be by an enchantment.’</p>
<p>‘Sir’ said she, ‘ye must make good cheer, and if ye be such a knight
as it is said ye be, I shall tell you more to-morn by prime of the
day’</p>
<p>‘Gramercy, fair damosel’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘of your good will I
require you.’</p>
<p>And so she departed. And there he lay all that night without comfort
of anybody. And on the morn early came these four queens, passingly well
beseen, all they bidding him good morn, and he them again.</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ the four queens said, ‘thou must understand thou art
our prisoner, and we here know thee well that thou art Sir Launcelot du
Lake, King Ban’s son, and because we understand your worthiness, that
thou art the noblest knight living, and as we know well there can no
lady have thy love but one, and that is Queen Guenever, and now thou
shalt lose her for ever, and she thee, and therefore thee behoveth now
to choose one of us four’</p>
<p>‘I am the Queen Morgan le Fay, queen of the land of Gore, and here is
the Queen of Northgales, and the Queen of East-land, and the Queen of
the Out Isles; now choose one of us which thou wilt have to thy
paramour, for thou mayest not choose or else in this prison to die’</p>
<p>‘This is an hard case,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘that either I must die
or else choose one of you, yet had I lever to die in this prison with
worship, than to have one of you to my paramour maugre my head. And
therefore ye be answered, I will none of you, for ye be false
enchantresses, and as for my lady, Dame Guenever, were I at my liberty
as I was, I would prove it on you or on yours, that she is the truest
lady unto her lord living.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said the queens, ‘is this your answer, that ye will refuse
us?’</p>
<p>‘Yea, on my life,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘refused ye be of me.’</p>
<p>So they departed and left him there alone that made great sorrow.</p>
