<h4 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h4>
<p>How the Lady of the Lake demanded the knight’s head that had won the
sword, or the maiden’s head</p>
<p>The meanwhile that this knight was making him ready to depart, there
came into the court a lady that hight the Lady of the Lake. And she came
on horseback, richly beseen, and saluted King Arthur, and there asked
him a gift at that he promised her when she gave him the sword.</p>
<p>‘That is sooth,’ said Arthur, ‘a gift I promised you, but I have
forgotten the name of my sword that ye gave me.’</p>
<p>‘The name of it,’ said the lady, ‘is Excalibur, that is as much to
say as Cut-steel.’</p>
<p>‘Ye say well,’ said the king, ‘ask what ye will and ye shall have it,
and it lie in my power to give it.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said the lady, ‘I ask the head of the knight that hath won
the sword, or else the damosel’s head that brought it; I take no force
though I have both their heads, for he slew my brother, a good knight
and a true, and that gentlewoman was causer of my father’s death.’</p>
<p>‘Truly,’ said King Arthur, ‘I may not grant neither of their heads
with my worship, therefore ask what ye will else, and I shall fulfil
your desire.’</p>
<p>‘I will ask none other thing,’ said the lady.</p>
<p>When Balin was ready to depart, he saw the Lady of the Lake, that by
her means had slain Balin’s mother, and he had sought her three years;
and when it was told him that she asked his head of King Arthur, he went
to her straight and said, ‘Evil be you found; ye would have my head, and
therefore ye shall lose yours,’ and with his sword lightly he smote off
her head before King Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Alas, for shame!’ said Arthur. ‘Why have ye done so? Ye have shamed
me and all my court, for this was a lady that I was beholden to, and
hither she came under my safe-conduct; I shall never forgive you that
trespass.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Balin, ‘me forthinketh of your displeasure, for this same
lady was the untruest lady living, and by enchantment and sorcery she
hath been the destroyer of many good knights, and she was causer that my
mother was burnt, through her falsehood and treachery.’</p>
<p>‘What cause soever ye had,’ said Arthur, ‘ye should have forborne her
in my presence; therefore, think not the contrary, ye shall repent it,
for such another despite had I never in my court; therefore withdraw you
out of my court in all haste that ye may.’</p>
<p>Then Balin took up the head of the lady, and bare it with him to his
hostelry, and there he met with his squire, that was sorry he had
displeased King Arthur, and so they rode forth out of the town.</p>
<p>‘Now,’ said Balin, ‘we must depart. Take thou this head and bear it
to my friends, and tell them how I have sped, and tell my friends in
Northumberland that my most foe is dead. Also tell them how I am out of
prison, and what adventure befell me at the getting of this sword.’</p>
<p>‘Alas!’ said the squire, ‘ye are greatly to blame for to displease
King Arthur.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said Balin, ‘I will hie me in all the haste that I may
to meet with King Rience and destroy him, either else to die therefore;
and if it may hap me to win him, then will King Arthur be my good and
gracious lord.’</p>
<p>‘Where shall I meet with you?’ said the squire.</p>
<p>‘In King Arthur’s court,’ said Balin. So his squire and he departed
at that time.</p>
<p>Then King Arthur and all the court made great dole and had shame of
the death of the Lady of the Lake. Then the king buried her richly.</p>
<p>me forthinketh: I regret.</p>
