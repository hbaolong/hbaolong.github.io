<h4 id="chapter-38">Chapter 38</h4>
<p>Of the treason of King Mark, and how Sir Gaheris smote him down and
Andred his cousin</p>
<p>Then there came Sir Kay, the Seneschal, unto King Mark, and there he
had good cheer showing outward.</p>
<p>‘Now fair lords,’ said he, ‘will ye prove any adventure in the Forest
of Morris, in the which I know well is as hard an adventure as I know
any.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Kay, ‘I will prove it.’</p>
<p>And Sir Gaheris said he would be advised, for King Mark was ever full
of treason; and therewithal Sir Gaheris departed and rode his way. And
by the same way that Sir Kay should ride he laid him down to rest,
charging his squire to wait upon Sir Kay; ‘And warn me when he
cometh.’</p>
<p>So within a while Sir Kay came riding that way, and then Sir Gaheris
took his horse and met him, and said, ‘Sir Kay, ye are not wise to ride
at the request of King Mark, for he dealeth all with treason.’</p>
<p>Then said Sir Kay, ‘I require you let us prove this adventure.’</p>
<p>‘I shall not fail you,’ said Sir Gaheris.</p>
<p>And so they rode that time till a lake that was that time called the
Perilous Lake, and there they abode under the shaw of the wood.</p>
<p>The meanwhile King Mark within the Castle of Tintagel avoided all his
barons, and all other save such as were privy with him were avoided out
of his chamber. And then he let call his nephew Sir Andred, and bad arm
him and horse him lightly; and by that time it was midnight. And so King
Mark was armed in black, horse and all; and so at a privy postern they
two issued out with their varlets with them, and rode till they came to
that lake.</p>
<p>Then Sir Kay espied them first, and gat his spear, and proffered to
joust. And King Mark rode against him, and smote each other full hard,
for the moon shone as the bright day. And there at that jousts Sir Kay’s
horse fell down, for his horse was not so big as the king’s horse, and
Sir Kay’s horse bruised him full sore. Then Sir Gaheris was wroth that
Sir Kay had a fall.</p>
<p>Then he cried, ‘Knight, sit thou fast in thy saddle, for I will
revenge my fellow!’</p>
<p>Then King Mark was afeared of Sir Gaheris, and so with evil will King
Mark rode against him, and Sir Gaheris gave him such a stroke that he
fell down.</p>
<p>So then forthwithal Sir Gaheris ran unto Sir Andred and smote him
from his horse quite, that his helm smote in the earth, and nigh had
broken his neck. And therewithal Sir Gaheris alit, and gat up Sir Kay.
And then they yode both on foot to them, and bad them yield them, and
tell their names other they should die.</p>
<p>Then with great pain Sir Andred spake first, and said, ‘It is King
Mark of Cornwall, therefore be ye ware what ye do, and I am Sir Andred,
his cousin.’</p>
<p>‘Fie on you both,’ said Sir Gaheris, ‘for a false traitor, and false
treason hast thou wrought and he both, under the feigned cheer that ye
made us! It were pity,’ said Sir Gaheris, ‘that thou shouldst live any
longer.’</p>
<p>‘Save my life,’ said King Mark, ‘and I will make amends; and consider
that I am a king anointed.’</p>
<p>‘It were the more shame,’ said Sir Gaheris, ‘to save thy life; thou
art a king anointed with cream, and therefore thou shouldest hold with
all men of worship; and therefore thou art worthy to die.’</p>
<p>With that he lashed at King Mark without saying any more, and covered
him with his shield and defended him as he might. And then Sir Kay
lashed at Sir Andred, and therewithal King Mark yielded him unto Sir
Gaheris. And then he kneeled adown, and made his oath upon the cross of
the sword, that never while he lived he would be against errant-knights.
And also he sware to be good friend unto Sir Tristram if ever he came
into Cornwall. By then Sir Andred was on the earth, and Sir Kay would
have slain him.</p>
<p>‘Let be,’ said Sir Gaheris, ‘slay him not I pray you.’</p>
<p>‘It were pity,’ said Sir Kay, ‘that he should live any longer, for
this is nigh cousin unto Sir Tristram, and ever he hath been a traitor
unto him, and by him he was exiled out of Cornwall, and therefore I will
slay him,’ said Sir Kay.</p>
<p>‘Ye shall not,’ said Sir Gaheris; ‘sithen I have given the king his
life, I pray you give him his life.’ And therewithal Sir Kay let him
go.</p>
<p>And so Sir Kay and Sir Gaheris rode their way unto Dinas, the
Seneschal, for because they heard say that he loved well Sir Tristram.
So they reposed them there, and soon after they rode unto the realm of
Logris.</p>
<p>And so within a little while they met with Sir Launcelot, that always
had Dame Bragwaine with him, to that intent he weened to have met the
sooner with Sir Tristram; and Sir Launcelot asked what tidings in
Cornwall, and whether they heard of Sir Tristram or not. Sir Kay and Sir
Gaheris answered and said that they heard not of him. Then they told Sir
Launcelot word by word of their adventure.</p>
<p>Then Sir Launcelot smiled and said, ‘Hard it is to take out of the
flesh that is bred in the bone;’ and so made them merry together.</p>
