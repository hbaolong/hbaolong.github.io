<h4 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h4>
<p>How Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawain were wroth because Sir Kay mocked
Beaumains, and of a damosel which desired a knight to fight for a
lady</p>
<p>Thereat was Sir Gawain wroth, and in especial Sir Launcelot bad Sir
Kay leave his mocking, ‘for I dare lay my head he shall prove a man of
great worship.’</p>
<p>‘Let be,’ said Sir Kay, ‘it may not be by no reason, for as he is, so
he hath asked.’</p>
<p>‘Beware,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘so ye gave the good knight Breunor,
Sir Dinadan’s brother, a name, and ye called him La Cote Male Taile,1
and that turned you to anger afterward.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said Sir Kay, ‘this shall never prove none such. For
Sir Breunor desired ever worship, and this desireth bread and drink and
broth; upon pain of my life he was fostered up in some abbey, and,
howsomever it was, they failed meat and drink, and so hither he is come
for his sustenance.’</p>
<p>And so Sir Kay bad get him a place, and sit down to meat; so
Beaumains went to the hall door, and set him down among boys and lads,
and there he ate sadly. And then Sir Launcelot after meat bad him come
to his chamber, and there he should have meat and drink enough. And so
did Sir Gawain; but he refused them all; he would do none other but as
Sir Kay commanded him, for no proffer.</p>
<p>But as touching Sir Gawain, he had reason to proffer him lodging,
meat, and drink, for that proffer came of his blood, for he was nearer
kin to him than he wist. But that as Sir Launcelot did was of his great
gentleness and courtesy.</p>
<p>So thus he was put into the kitchen, and lay nightly as the boys of
the kitchen did. And so he endured all that twelvemonth, and never
displeased man nor child, but always he was meek and mild. But ever when
that he saw any jousting of knights, that would he see and he might. And
ever Sir Launcelot would give him gold to spend, and clothes, and so did
Sir Gawain, and where there were any masteries done, thereat would he
be, and there might none cast bar nor stone to him by two yards. Then
would Sir Kay say, ‘How liketh you my boy of the kitchen?’</p>
<p>So it passed on till the feast of Whitsuntide. And at that time the
king held it at Caerleon in the most royallest wise that might be, like
as he did yearly. But the king would no meat eat upon the Whitsunday,
until he heard some adventures.</p>
<p>Then came there a squire to the king and said, ‘Sir, ye may go to
your meat, for here cometh a damosel with some strange adventures.’</p>
<p>Then was the king glad and sat him down. Right so there came a
damosel into the hall and saluted the king, and prayed him of
succour.</p>
<p>‘For whom?’ said the king, ‘What is the adventure?’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ she said, ‘I have a lady of great worship and renown, and she
is besieged with a tyrant, so that she may not out of her castle; and
because here are called the noblest knights of the world, I come to you
to pray you of succour.’</p>
<p>‘What heteth your lady, and where dwelleth she, and who is he, and
what is his name that hath besieged her?’</p>
<p>‘Sir King,’ she said, ‘as for my lady’s name that shall not ye know
for me as at this time, but I let you wit she is lady of great worship
and of great lands; and as for the tyrant that besiegeth her and
destroyeth her lands, he is called the Red Knight of the Red
Launds.’</p>
<p>‘I know him not,’ said the king.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘I know him well, for he is one of the
periloust knights of the world; men say that he hath seven men’s
strength, and from him I escaped once full hard with my life.’</p>
<p>‘Fair damosel,’ said the king, ‘there be knights here would do their
power for to rescue your lady, but because ye will not tell her name,
nor where she dwelleth, therefore none of my knights that here be now
shall go with you by my will.’</p>
<p>‘Then must I speak further,’ said the damosel.</p>
<p>brose: broth.</p>
<p>heteth: is called.</p>
