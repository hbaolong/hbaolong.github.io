<h4 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h4>
<p>How the damosel and Beaumains came to the siege, and came to a
sycamore tree, and there Beaumains blew an horn, and then the Knight of
the Red Launds came to fight with him</p>
<p>Now leave we the knight and the dwarf, and speak we of Beaumains,
that all night lay in the hermitage; and upon the morn he and the
damosel Lynet heard their mass and brake their fast. And then they took
their horses and rode throughout a fair forest; and then they came to a
plain, and saw where were many pavilions and tents, and a fair castle,
and there was much smoke and great noise. And when they came near the
siege Sir Beaumains espied upon great trees, as he rode, how there hung
full goodly armed knights by the neck, and their shields about their
necks with their swords, and gilt spurs upon their heels, and so there
hung nigh a forty knights shamefully with full rich arms. Then Sir
Beaumains abated his countenance and said, ‘What meaneth this?’</p>
<p>‘Fair sir,’ said the damosel, ‘abate not your cheer for all this
sight, for ye must courage yourself, or else ye be all shent, for all
these knights came hither to this siege to rescue my sister Dame
Lyonesse, and when the Red Knight of the Red Launds had overcome them,
he put them to this shameful death without mercy and pity. And in the
same wise he will serve you but if ye quit you the better.’</p>
<p>‘Now Jesu defend me,’ said Beaumains, ‘from such a villainous death
and shenship of arms. For rather than I should so be faren withal, I
would rather be slain manly in plain battle.’</p>
<p>‘So were ye better,’ said the damosel; ‘for trust not, in him is no
courtesy, but all goeth to the death or shameful murder, and that is
pity, for he is a full likely man, well made of body, and a full noble
knight of prowess, and a lord of great lands and possessions.’</p>
<p>‘Truly,’ said Beaumains, ‘he may well be a good knight, but he useth
shameful customs, and it is marvel that he endureth so long that none of
the noble knights of my lord Arthur’s have not dealt with him.’</p>
<p>And then they rode to the dykes, and saw them double dyked with full
warly walls; and there were lodged many great lords nigh the walls; and
there was great noise of minstrelsy; and the sea beated upon the one
side of the walls, where were many ships and mariners’ noise with ‘hale
and how.’ And also there was fast by a sycamore tree, and there hung an
horn, the greatest that ever they saw, of an elephant’s bone; and this
Knight of the Red Launds had hanged it up there, that if there came any
errant knight, he must blow that horn, and then will he make him ready
and come to him to do battle.</p>
<p>‘But, sir, I pray you,’ said the damosel Lynet, ‘blow ye not the horn
till it be high noon, for now it is about prime, and now increaseth1 his
might, that as men say he hath seven men’s strength.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, fie for shame, fair damosel, say ye never so more to me; for and
he were as good a knight as ever was, I shall never fail him in his most
might, for either I will win worship worshipfully, or die knightly in
the field.’</p>
<p>And therewith he spurred his horse straight to the sycamore tree, and
blew so the horn eagerly that all the siege and the castle rang thereof.
And then there leapt out knights out of their tents and pavilions, and
they within the castle looked over the walls and out at windows.</p>
<p>Then the Red Knight of the Red Launds armed him hastily, and two
barons set on his spurs upon his heels, and all was blood red, his
armour, spear and shield. And an earl buckled his helm upon his head,
and then they brought him a red spear and a red steed, and so he rode
into a little vale under the castle, that all that were in the castle
and at the siege might behold the battle.</p>
