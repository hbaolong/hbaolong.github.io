<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>
<p>How Beaumains came to King Arthur’s court and demanded three
petitions of King Arthur</p>
<p>When Arthur held his Round Table most plenour, it fortuned that he
commanded that the high feast of Pentecost should be holden at a city
and a castle, the which in those days was called Kinkenadon, upon the
sands that marched nigh Wales. So ever the king had a custom that at the
feast of Pentecost in especial, afore other feasts in the year, he would
not go that day to meat until he had heard or seen of a great marvel.
And for that custom all manner of strange adventures came before Arthur
as at that feast before all other feasts.</p>
<p>And so Sir Gawain, a little tofore noon of the day of Pentecost,
espied at a window three men upon horseback, and a dwarf on foot, and so
the three men alit, and the dwarf kept their horses, and one of the
three men was higher than the other twain by a foot and an half.</p>
<p>Then Sir Gawain went unto the king and said, ‘Sir, go to your meat,
for here at the hand comen strange adventures.’</p>
<p>So Arthur went unto his meat with many other kings. And there were
all the knights of the Round Table only those that were prisoners or
slain at a recounter. Then at the high feast evermore they should be
fulfilled the whole number of an hundred and fifty, for then was the
Round Table fully complished.</p>
<p>Right so came into the hall two men well beseen and richly, and upon
their shoulders there leaned the goodliest young man and the fairest
that ever they all saw, and he was large and long and broad in the
shoulders, and well visaged, and the fairest and the largest handed that
ever man saw, but he fared as though he might not go nor bear himself
but if he leaned upon their shoulders. Anon as Arthur saw him there was
made peace and room, and right so they yede with him unto the high dais,
without saying of any words.</p>
<p>Then this much young man pulled him aback, and easily stretched up
straight, saying, ‘King Arthur, God you bless and all your fair
fellowship, and in especial the fellowship of the Table Round. And for
this cause I am come hither, to pray you and require you to give me
three gifts, and they shall not be unreasonably asked, but that ye may
worship-fully and honourably grant them me, and to you no great hurt nor
loss. And the first done and gift I will ask now, and the other two
gifts I will ask this day twelvemonth, wheresomever ye hold your high
feast.’</p>
<p>‘Now ask,’ said Arthur, ‘and ye shall have your asking.’</p>
<p>‘Now, sir, this is my petition for this feast, that ye will give me
meat and drink sufficiently for this twelvemonth, and at that day I will
ask mine other two gifts.’</p>
<p>‘My fair son,’ said Arthur, ‘ask better, I counsel thee, for this is
but a simple asking; for my heart giveth me to thee greatly, that thou
art come of men of worship, and greatly my conceit faileth me but thou
shalt prove a man of right great worship.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ he said, ‘thereof be as it be may, I have asked that I will
ask.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said the king, ’ye shall have meat and drink enough;</p>
<p>I never defended that none, neither my friend ne my foe. But what is
thy name I would wit?’</p>
<p>‘I cannot tell you,’ said he.</p>
<p>‘That is marvel,’ said the king, ‘that thou knowest not thy name, and
thou art the goodliest young man one that ever I saw.’</p>
<p>Then the king betook him to Sir Kay the steward, and charged him that
he should give him of all manner of meats and drinks of the best, and
also that he had all manner of finding as though he were a lord’s
son.</p>
<p>‘That shall little need,’ said Sir Kay, ‘to do such cost upon him;
for I dare undertake he is a villain born, and never will make man, for
and he had come of gentlemen he would have asked of you horse and
armour, but such as he is, so he asketh. And sithen he hath no name, I
shall give him a name that shall be Beaumains, that is Fair-hands. And
into the kitchen I shall bring him, and there he shall have fat brose
every day, that he shall be as fat by the twelvemonths’ end as a pork
hog.’</p>
<p>Right so the two men departed and beleft him to Sir Kay, that scorned
him and mocked him.</p>
<p>plenour: with the full number. complished: filled.</p>
<p>defended: refused.</p>
