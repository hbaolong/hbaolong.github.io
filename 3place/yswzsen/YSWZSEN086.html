<h4 id="chapter-24">Chapter 24</h4>
<p>How Sir Marhaus rode with the damosel, and how he came to the Duke of
the South Marches</p>
<p>Now turn we unto Sir Marhaus, that rode with the damosel of thirty
winter of age, southward. And so they came into a deep forest, and by
fortune they were nighted, and rode long in a deep way, and at the last
they came unto a courtelage, and there they asked harbour.</p>
<p>But the man of the courtelage would not lodge them for no treaties
that they could treat, but thus much the good man said: ‘And ye will
take the adventure of your lodging, I shall bring you there ye shall be
lodged.’</p>
<p>‘What adventure is that that I shall have for my lodging?’ said Sir
Marhaus.</p>
<p>‘Ye shall wit when ye come there’ said the good man.</p>
<p>‘Sir, what adventure so it be, bring me thither I pray thee.’ said
Sir Marhaus; ‘for I am weary, my damosel, and my horse.’</p>
<p>So the good man went and opened the gate, and within an hour he
brought him unto a fair castle, and then the poor man called the porter,
and anon he was let into the castle, and so he told the lord how he
brought him a knight errant and a damosel that would be lodged with
him.</p>
<p>‘Let him in’ said the lord, ‘it may happen he shall repent that they
took their lodging here.’</p>
<p>So Sir Marhaus was let in with torchlight, and there was a goodly
sight of young men that welcomed him. And then his horse was led into
the stable, and he and the damosel were brought into the hall, and there
stood a mighty duke and many goodly men about him. Then this lord asked
him what he hight, and from whence he came, and with whom he dwelt.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ he said, ‘I am a knight of King Arthur’s and knight of the
Table Round,1 and my name is Sir Marhaus, and born I am in Ireland.’</p>
<p>And then said the duke to him, ‘That me sore repenteth; the cause is
this: for I love not thy lord nor none of thy fellows of the Table
Round; and therefore ease thyself this night as well as thou mayest, for
as to-morn I and my six sons shall match with you.’</p>
<p>‘Is there no remedy but that I must have ado with you and your six
sons at once?’ said Sir Marhaus.</p>
<p>‘No,’ said the duke, ‘for this cause I made mine avow, for Sir Gawain
slew my seven sons in a recounter, therefore I made mine avow, there
should never knight of King Arthur’s court lodge with me, or come
thereas I might have ado with him, but that I would have a revenging of
my sons’ death.’</p>
<p>‘What is your name?’ said Sir Marhaus; ‘I require you tell me, and it
please you.’</p>
<p>‘Wit thou well I am the Duke of South Marches.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said Sir Marhaus, ‘I have heard say that ye have been long time
a great foe unto my lord Arthur and to his knights.’</p>
<p>‘That shall ye feel to-morn’ said the duke.</p>
<p>‘Shall I have ado with you?’ said Sir Marhaus.</p>
<p>‘Yea,’ said the duke, ‘thereof shalt thou not choose, and therefore
take you to your chamber, and ye shall have all that to you
longeth.’</p>
<p>So Sir Marhaus departed and was led to a chamber, and his damosel was
led unto her chamber. And on the morn the duke sent unto Sir Marhaus and
bad make him ready. And so Sir Marhaus arose and armed him, and then
there was a mass sung afore him, and brake his fast, and so mounted on
horseback in the court of the castle there they should do the battle. So
there was the duke all ready on horseback, clean armed, and his six sons
by him, and every each had a spear in his hand, and so they encountered,
whereas the duke and his two sons brake their spears upon him, but Sir
Marhaus held up his spear and touched none of them.</p>
