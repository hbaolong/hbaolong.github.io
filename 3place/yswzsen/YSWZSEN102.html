<h4 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h4>
<p>How Sir Gawain returned to King Arthur with his prisoners, and how
the king won a city, and how he was crowned emperor</p>
<p>‘Now thanked be God,’ said the noble King Arthur. ‘But what manner
man is he that standeth by himself, him seemed no prisoner?’</p>
<p>‘Sir’, said Gawain, ‘this is a good man of arms, he hath matched me,
but he is yielden unto God, and to me, for to become Christian; had not
he have been we should never have returned, wherefore I pray you that he
may be baptised, for there liveth not a nobler man ne better knight of
his hands.’</p>
<p>Then the king let him anon be christened; and did do call his first
name Priamus, and made him a duke and knight of the Table Round.</p>
<p>And then anon the king let do cry assault to the city, and there was
rearing of ladders, breaking of walls, and the ditch filled, that men
with little pain might enter into the city.</p>
<p>Then came out a duchess, and Clarisin the countess, with many ladies
and damosels, and kneeling before King Arthur, required him for the love
of God to receive the city, and not to take it by assault, for then
should many guiltless be slain.</p>
<p>Then the king avaled his visor with a meek and noble countenance, and
said, ‘Madam, there shall none of my subjects misdo you ne your maidens,
ne to none that to you longen, but the duke shall abide my
judgement.’</p>
<p>Then anon the king commanded to leave the assault, and anon the
duke’s oldest son brought out the keys, and kneeling delivered them to
the king, and besought him of grace. And the king seized the town by
assent of his lords, and took the duke and sent him to Dover, there for
to abide prisoner term of his life, and assigned certain rents for the
dower of the duchess and for her children.</p>
<p>Then he made lords to rule those lands, and laws as a lord ought to
do in his own country. And after he took his journey toward Rome, and
sent Sir Florence and Sir Floridas tofore, with five hundred men of
arms, and they came to the city of Urbino and laid there a bushment,
thereas them seemed most best for them, and rode tofore the town, where
anon issued out much people and skirmished with the fore-riders. Then
brake out the bushment and won the bridge, and after the town, and set
upon the walk the king’s banner. Then came the king upon an hill, and
saw the city and his banner on the walls, by which he knew that the city
was won. And anon he sent and commanded that none of his liege men
should defoul ne lie by no lady, wife, ne maid; and when he came into
the city, he passed to the castle, and comforted them that were in
sorrow, and ordained there a captain, a knight of his own country.</p>
<p>And when they of Milan heard that thilk city was won, they sent to
King Arthur great sums of money, and besought him as their lord to have
pity of them, promising to be his subjects for ever, and yield to him
homage and fealty for the lands of Pleasance and Pavia, Petersaint, and
the Port of Tremble,1 and to give him yearly a million of gold all his
lifetime.</p>
<p>Then he rideth into Tuscany, and winneth towns and castles, and
wasted all in his way that to him will not obey, and so to Spoleto and
Viterbo, and from thence he rode into the Vale of Vicecount among the
vines.</p>
<p>And from thence he sent to the senators, to wit whether they would
know him for their lord. But soon after on a Saturday came unto King
Arthur all the senators that were left alive, and the noblest cardinals
that then dwelt in Rome, and prayed him of peace, and preferred him full
large, and besought him as governor to give licence for six weeks for to
assemble all the Romans, and then to crown him emperor with cream as it
belongeth to so high estate.</p>
<p>‘I assent’ said the king, ‘like as ye have devised, and at Christmas
there to be crowned, and to hold my Round Table with my knights as me
liketh.’</p>
<p>And then the senators made ready for his enthronization. And at the
day appointed, as the romance telleth, he came into Rome, and was
crowned emperor by the Pope’s hand, with all the royalty that could be
made, and sojourned there a time, and established all his lands from
Rome into France, and gave lands and realms unto his servants and
knights, to every each after his desert, in such wise that none
complained, rich ne poor. And he gave to Sir Priamus the duchy of
Lorraine; and he thanked him, and said he would serve him the days of
his life; and after made dukes and earls, and made every man rich.</p>
<p>Then after this all his knights and lords assembled them afore him,
and said, ‘Blessed be God, your war is finished and your conquest
achieved, in so much that we know none so great ne mighty that dare make
war against you; wherefore we beseech you to return homeward, and give
us licence to go home to our wives, from Whom we have been long, and to
rest us, for your journey is finished with honour and worship.’</p>
<p>Then said the king, ‘Ye say truth, and for to tempt God it is no
wisdom, and therefore make you ready and return we into England.’</p>
<p>Then there was trussing of harness and baggage and great carriage.
And after licence given, he returned and commanded that no man in pain
of death should not rob ne take victual, ne other thing by the way but
that he should pay therefore. And thus he came over the sea and landed
at Sandwich, against whom Queen Guenever his wife came and met him, and
he was nobly received of all his commons in every city and burgh, and
great gifts presented to him at his homecoming to welcome him with.</p>
<p>Thus endeth the fifth book of the conquest that King Arthur</p>
<p>had against Lucius the Emperor of Rome, and here</p>
<p>followeth the sixth book, which is of Sir</p>
<p>Launcelot du Lake</p>
<p>avaled: lowered.</p>
<p>thilk: that.</p>
<p>cream: chrism.</p>
<p>burgh: town.</p>
