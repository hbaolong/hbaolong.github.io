<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>
<p>How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel departed from the court for to seek
adventures, and how Sir Lionel left him sleeping and was taken</p>
<p>Soon after that King Arthur was come from Rome into England, then all
the knights of the Table Round resorted unto the king, and made many
jousts and tournaments. And some there were that were but knights, which
increased so in arms and worship that they passed all their fellows in
prowess and noble deeds, and that was well proved on many; but in
especial it was proved on Sir Launcelot du Lake, for in all tournaments
and jousts and deeds of arms, born for life and death, he passed all
other knights, and at no time he was never overcome but if it were by
treason or enchantment, so Sir Launcelot increased so marvellously in
worship, and in honour, therefore is he the first knight that the French
book maketh mention of after King Arthur came from Rome. Wherefore Queen
Guenever had him in great favour above all knights, and in certain he
loved the queen again above all other ladies damosels of his life, and
for her he did many deeds of arms, and saved her from the fire through
his noble chivalry.</p>
<p>Thus Sir Launcelot rested him long with play and game. And then he
thought himself to prove himself in strange adventures, then he bad his
nephew, Sir Lionel, for to make him ready, ‘for we two will seek
adventures.’</p>
<p>So they mounted on their horses, armed at all rights, and rode into a
deep forest and so into a deep plain. And then the weather was hot about
noon, and Sir Launcelot had great lust to sleep. Then Sir Lionel espied
a great apple tree that stood by an hedge, and said, ‘Brother, yonder is
a fair shadow, there may we rest us on our horses.’</p>
<p>‘It is well said, fair brother’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘for this seven
year I was not so sleepy as I am now.’</p>
<p>And so they there alighted and tied their horses unto sundry trees,
and so Sir Launcelot laid him down under an apple tree, and his helm he
laid under his head. And Sir Lionel waked while he slept. So Sir
Launcelot was asleep passing fast.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile there came three knights riding, as fast fleeing
as ever they might ride. And there followed them three but one knight.
And when Sir Lionel saw him, him thought he saw never so great a knight,
nor so well faring a man, neither so well apparelled unto all
rights.</p>
<p>So within a while this strong knight had overtaken one of these
knights, and there he smote him to the cold earth that he lay still. And
then he rode unto the second knight, and smote him so that man and horse
fell down. And then straight to the third knight he rode, and smote him
behind his horse’s arse a spear length. And then he alit down and reined
his horse on the bridle, and bound all the three knights fast with the
reins of their own bridles.</p>
<p>When Sir Lionel saw him do thus, he thought to assay him, and made
him ready, and stilly and privily he took his horse, and thought not for
to awake Sir Launcelot. And when he was mounted upon his horse, he
overtook this strong knight, and bad him turn, and the other smote Sir
Lionel so hard that horse and man he bare to the earth, and so he alit
down and bound him fast, and threw him overthwart his own horse, and so
he served them all four, and rode with them away to his own castle.</p>
<p>And when he came there he gart unarm them, and beat them with thorns
all naked, and after put them in a deep prison where were many more
knights that made great dolour.</p>
