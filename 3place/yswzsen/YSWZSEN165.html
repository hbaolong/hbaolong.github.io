<h4 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram won the degree at a tournament in Ireland, and there
made Palomides to bear no harness in a year</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram asked him what he did in those countries.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ he said, ‘I came hither with Sir Gawain for to be made knight,
and if it please you, of your hands that I may be made knight.’</p>
<p>‘Await upon me as tomorn secretly, and in the field I shall make you
a knight.’</p>
<p>Then had La Beale Isoud great suspicion unto Tramtrist, that he was
some man of worship proved, and therewith she comforted herself, and
cast more love unto him than she had done tofore.</p>
<p>And so on the morn Sir Palomides made him ready to come into the
field as he did the first day. And there he smote down the King with the
Hundred Knights, and the King of Scots. Then had La Beale Isoud ordained
and well arrayed Sir Tristram in white horse and harness. And right so
she let put him out at a privy postern, and so he came into the field as
it had been a bright angel. And anon Sir Palomides espied him, and
therewith he fewtered a spear unto Sir Tramtrist, and he again unto him.
And there Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palomides unto the earth.</p>
<p>And then there was a great noise of people: some said Sir Palomides
had a fall, some said the Knight with the Black Shield had a fall. And
wit you well La Beale Isoud was passing glad. And then Sir Gawain and
his fellows nine had marvel what knight it might be that had smitten
down Sir Palomides. Then would there none joust with Tramtrist, but all
that there were forsook him, most and least.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram made Hebes a knight, and caused him to put himself
forth, and did right well that day. So after Sir Hebes held him with Sir
Tristram.</p>
<p>And when Sir Palomides had received this fall, wit ye well that he
was sore ashamed, and as privily as he might he withdrew him out of the
field. All that espied Sir Tristram, and lightly he rode after Sir
Palomides and overtook him, and bad him turn, for better he would assay
him or ever he departed. Then Sir Palomides turned him, and either
lashed at other with their swords. But at the first stroke Sir Tristram
smote down Palomides, and gave him such a stroke upon the head that he
fell to the earth. So then Tristram bad yield him, and do his
commandment, or else he would slay him. When Sir Palomides beheld his
countenance, he dread his buffets so, that he granted all his
askings.</p>
<p>‘Well said,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘this shall be your charge: First,
upon pain of your life that ye forsake my lady La Beale Isoud, and in no
manner wise that ye draw not to her. Also this twelvemonth and a day
that ye bear none armour nor none harness of war. Now promise me this,
or here shalt thou die.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Palomides, ‘for ever I am ashamed.’</p>
<p>Then he sware as Sir Tristram had commanded him. Then for despite and
anger Sir Palomides cut off his harness, and threw them away.</p>
<p>And so Sir Tristram turned again to the castle where was La Beale
Isoud; and by the way he met with a damosel that asked after Sir
Launcelot, that won the Dolorous Guard worshipfully; and this damosel
asked Sir Tristram what he was. For it was told her that it was he that
smote down Sir Palomides, by whom the ten knights of King Arthur’s were
smitten down. Then the damosel prayed Sir Tristram to tell her what he
was, and whether that he were Sir Launcelot du Lake, for she deemed that
there was no knight in the world might do such deeds of arms but it were
Launcelot.</p>
<p>‘Fair damosel,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘wit ye well that I am not Sir
Launcelot, for I was never of such prowess, but in God is all that He
may make me as good a knight as the good knight Sir Launcelot.’</p>
<p>‘Now, gentle knight,’ said she, ‘put up thy visor;’ and when she
beheld his visage she thought she saw never a better man’s visage, nor a
better faring knight. And then when the damosel knew certainly that he
was not Sir Launcelot, then she took her leave, and departed from
him.</p>
<p>And then Sir Tristram rode privily unto the postern, where kept him
La Beale Isoud, and there she made him good cheer, and thanked God of
his good speed. So anon, within a while the king and the queen
understood that it was Tramtrist that smote down Sir Palomides; then was
he much made of, more than he was before.</p>
