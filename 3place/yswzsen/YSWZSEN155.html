<h4 id="chapter-35">Chapter 35</h4>
<p>Of the great royalty, and what officers were made at the feast of the
wedding, and of the jousts at the feast</p>
<p>So it drew fast to Michaelmas; and thither came Dame Lyonesse, the
lady of the Castle Perilous, and her sister, Dame Lynet, with Sir
Gringamore, her brother, with them, for he had the conduct of these
ladies. And there they were lodged at the device of King Arthur. And
upon Michaelmas Day the Bishop of Canterbury made the wedding betwixt
Sir Gareth and the Lady Lyonesse with great solemnity.</p>
<p>And King Arthur made Gaheris to wed the Damosel Savage, that was Dame
Lynet; and King Arthur made Sir Agravain to wed Dame Lyonesse’s niece, a
fair lady, her name was Dame Laurel.</p>
<p>And so when this solemnation was done, then came in the Green Knight,
Sir Pertolepe, with thirty knights, and there he did homage and fealty
to Sir Gareth, and these knights to hold of him for evermore. Also Sir
Pertolepe said, ‘I pray you that at this feast I may be your
chamberlain.’</p>
<p>‘With a good will,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘sith it liketh you to take so
simple an office.’</p>
<p>Then came in the Red Knight, with three score knights with him, and
did to Sir Gareth homage and fealty, and all those knights to hold of
him for evermore. And then this Sir Perimones prayed Sir Gareth to grant
him to be his chief butler at that high feast.</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘that ye have this office, and it
were better.’</p>
<p>Then came in Sir Persant of Inde, with an hundred knights with him,
and there he did homage and fealty, and all his knights should do him
service, and hold their lands of him for ever; and there he prayed Sir
Gareth to make him his sewer-chief at the feast.</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘that ye have it, and it were
better.’</p>
<p>Then came the Duke de la Rowse, with an hundred knights with him, and
there he did homage and fealty to Sir Gareth, and so to hold their lands
of him for ever. And he required Sir Gareth that he might serve him of
the wine that day at that feast.</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘and it were better.’</p>
<p>Then came in the Red Knight of the Red Launds, that was Sir Ironside,
and he brought with him three hundred knights, and there he did homage
and fealty, and all these knights to hold their lands of him for ever.
And then he asked Sir Gareth to be his carver.</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘and it please you.’</p>
<p>Then came into the court thirty ladies, and all they seemed widows,
and those thirty ladies brought with them many fair gentlewomen. And all
they kneeled down at once unto King Arthur and unto Sir Gareth, and
there all those ladies told the king how Sir Gareth delivered them from
the Dolorous Tower, and slew the Brown Knight without Pity: ‘And
therefore we, and our heirs for evermore, will do homage unto Sir Gareth
of Orkney.’</p>
<p>So then the kings and queens, princes and earls, barons and many bold
knights, went unto meat; and well may ye wit there were all manner of
meat plenteously, all manner revels and games, with all manner of
minstrelsy that was used in those days. Also there was great jousts
three days. But the king would not suffer Sir Gareth to joust, because
of his new bride; for, as the French book sayeth, that Dame Lyonesse
desired of the king that none that were wedded should joust at that
feast.</p>
<p>So the first day there jousted Sir Lamorak de Gales, for he overthrew
thirty knights, and did passing marvellously deeds of arms; and then
King Arthur made Sir Persant and his two brethren knights of the Round
Table to their lives’ end, and gave them great lands.</p>
<p>Also the second day there jousted Tristram best, and he overthrew
forty knights, and did there marvellous deeds of arms. And there King
Arthur made Ironside, that was the Red Knight of the Red Launds, a
knight of the Table Round to his life’s end, and gave him great
lands.</p>
<p>The third day there jousted Sir Launcelot du Lake, and he overthrew
fifty knights, and did many marvellous deeds of arms, that all men
wondered on him. And there King Arthur made the Duke de la Rowse a
knight of the Round Table to his life’s end, and gave him great lands to
spend.</p>
<p>But when these jousts were done, Sir Lamorak and Sir Tristram
departed suddenly, and would not be known, for the which King Arthur and
all the court were sore displeased. And so they held the court forty
days with great solemnity. And this Sir Gareth was a noble knight, and a
well-ruled, and fair-languaged.</p>
<p>Thus endeth this tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney that wedded Dame
Lyonesse of the Castle Perilous. And also Sir Gaheris wedded her sister,
Dame Lynet, that was called the Damosel Savage. And Sir Agravai wedded
Dame Laurel, a fair lady, and great and mighty lands with great riches
gave with them King Arthur, that royally they might live till their
lives’ end.</p>
<p>Here followeth the viii. book, the which is the first hook of Sir</p>
<p>Tristram de Liones, and who was his father and his</p>
<p>mother, and how he was born and fostered</p>
<p>and how he was made knight</p>
<p>device: arrangement. sewer-chief: chief serving man.</p>
