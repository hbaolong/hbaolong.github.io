<h4 id="chapter-26">Chapter 26</h4>
<p>How Damosel Bragwaine found Tristram sleeping by a well, and how she
delivered letters to him from La Beale Isoud</p>
<p>And then the pulled off his helm and washed his visage and his hands,
and so he fell asleep.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile came a damosel that had sought Sir Tristram many
ways and days within this land. And when she came to the well she looked
upon him, and had forgotten him as in remembrance of Sir Tristram, but
by his horse she knew him, that hight Passe-Brewel that had been Sir
Tristram’s horse many years. For when he was mad in the forest Sir
Fergus kept him. So this lady, Dame Bragwaine, abode still till he was
awake. So when she saw him wake she saluted him, and he her again, for
either knew other of old acquaintance; then she told him how she had
sought him long and broad, and there she told him how she had letters
from Queen La Beale Isoud. Then anon Sir Tristram read them, and wit ye
well he was glad, for therein was many a piteous complaint.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram said, ‘Lady Bragwaine, ye shall ride with me till
that tournament be done at the Castle of Maidens, and then shall ye bear
letters and tidings with you.’</p>
<p>And then Sir Tristram took his horse and sought lodging, and there he
met with a good ancient knight and prayed him to lodge with him. Right
so came Gouvernail unto Sir Tristram, that was glad of that lady. So
this old knight’s name was Sir Pellounes, and he told of the great
tournament that should be at the Castle of Maidens. And there Sir
Launcelot and thirty-two knights of his blood had ordained shields of
Cornwall.</p>
<p>And right so there came one unto Sir Pellounes, and told him that Sir
Persides de Bloise was come home; then that knight held up his hands and
thanked God of his coming home. And there Sir Pellounes told Sir
Tristram that in two years he had not seen his son, Sir Persides.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I know your son well enough for a good
knight.’</p>
<p>So on a time Sir Tristram and Sir Persides came to their lodging both
at once, and so they unarmed them, and put upon them their clothing. And
then these two knights each welcomed other.</p>
<p>And when Sir Persides understood that Sir Tristram was of Cornwall,
he said he was once in Cornwall: ‘And there I jousted afore King Mark;
and so it happed me at that time to overthrow ten knights, and then came
to me Sir Tristram de Liones and overthrew me, and took my lady away
from me, and that shall I never forget, but I shall remember me and ever
I see my time.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘now I understand that ye hate Sir Tristram.
What deem ye, ween ye that Sir Tristram is not able to withstand your
malice?’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ said Sir Persides, ‘I know well that Sir Tristram is a noble
knight, and a much better knight than I, yet shall I not owe him my good
will.’</p>
<p>Right as they stood thus talking at a bay-window of that castle, they
saw many knights riding to and fro toward the tournament. And then was
Sir Tristram ware of a likely knight riding upon a great black horse,
and a black-covered shield.</p>
<p>‘What knight is that,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘with the black horse and
the black shield? He seemeth a good knight.’</p>
<p>‘I know him well,’ said Sir Persides, ‘he is one of the best knights
of the world.’</p>
<p>‘Then is it Sir Launcelot,’ said Tristram.</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Persides, ‘it is Sir Palomides, that is yet
unchristened.’</p>
