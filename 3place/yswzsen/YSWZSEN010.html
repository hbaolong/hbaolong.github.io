<h4 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h4>
<p>Of the first war that King Arthur had, and how he won the field</p>
<p>Then King Arthur came out of his tower, and had under his gown a
jesseraunte of double mail, and there went with him the Archbishop of
Canterbury, and Sir Baudwin of Britain, and Sir Kay, and Sir Brastias:
these were the men of most worship that were with him. And when they
were met there was no meekness, but stout words on both sides; but
always King Arthur answered them, and said he would make them to bow and
he lived. Wherefore they departed with wrath, and King Arthur bad keep
them well, and they bad the king keep him well. So the king returned him
to the tower again and armed him and all his knights.</p>
<p>‘What will ye do?’ said Merlin to the kings. ‘Ye were better for to
stint, for ye shall not here prevail though ye were ten so many.’</p>
<p>‘Be we well advised to be afeared of a dream-reader?’ said King
Lot.</p>
<p>With that Merlin vanished away, and came to King Arthur, and bad him
set on them fiercely. And in the meanwhile there were three hundred good
men of the best that were with the kings, that went straight unto King
Arthur and that comforted him greatly.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Merlin to Arthur, ‘fight not with the sword that ye had
by miracle, till that ye see ye go unto the worse, then draw it out and
do your best.’</p>
<p>So forthwithal King Arthur set upon them in their lodging. And Sir
Baudwin, Sir Kay, and Sir Brastias slew on the right hand and on the
left hand that it was marvel, and always King Arthur on horseback laid
on with a sword, and did marvellous deeds of arms that many of the kings
had great joy of his deeds and hardiness. Then King Lot brake out on the
back side, and the King with the Hundred Knights, and King Carados, and
set on Arthur fiercely behind him. With that Sir Arthur turned with his
knights, and smote behind and before, and ever Sir Arthur was in the
foremost press till his horse was slain underneath him. And therewith
King Lot smote down King Arthur. With that his four knights received him
and set him on horseback. Then he drew his sword Excalibur,1 but it was
so bright in his enemies’ eyen, that it gave light like thirty torches.
And therewith he put them aback, and slew much people. And then the
commons of Caerleon arose with clubs and staves and slew many knights;
but all the kings held them together with their knights that were left
alive, and so fled and departed. And Merlin came unto Arthur, and
counselled him to follow them no further.</p>
