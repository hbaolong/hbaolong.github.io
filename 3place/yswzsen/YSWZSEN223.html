<h4 id="chapter-27">Chapter 27</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram had a fall of Sir Palomides, and how Launcelot
overthrew two knights</p>
<p>Then they saw much people of the country salute Sir Palomides. And
within a while after there came a squire of the castle, that told Sir
Fellounes, that was lord of that castle, that a knight with a black
shield had smitten down thirteen knights.</p>
<p>‘Fair brother,’ said Sir Tristram unto Sir Persides, ‘let us cast
upon us cloaks, and let us go see the play.’</p>
<p>‘Not so,’ said Sir Persides, ‘we will not go like knaves thither, but
we will ride like men and good knights to withstand our enemies.’</p>
<p>So they armed them, and took their horses and great spears, and
thither they went thereas many knights assayed themself before the
tournament.</p>
<p>And anon Sir Palomides saw Sir Persides, and then he sent a squire
unto him and said, ‘Go thou to the yonder knight with the green shield
and therein a lion of gules, and say him I require him to joust with me,
and tell him that my name is Sir Palomides.’</p>
<p>When Sir Persides understood that request of Sir Palomides, he made
him ready, and there anon they met together, but Sir Persides had a
fall.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram dressed him to be revenged upon Sir Palomides, and
that saw Sir Palomides that was ready and so was not Sir Tristram, and
took him at advantage and smote him over his horse’s tail when he had no
spear in his rest. Then start up Sir Tristram and took his horse
lightly, and was wroth out of measure, and sore ashamed of that fall
Then Sir Tristram sent unto Sir Palomides by Gouvernail, and prayed him
to joust with him at his request.</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Palomides, ‘as at this time I will not joust with
that knight, for I know him better than he weeneth. And if he be wroth
he may right it tomorn at the Castle of Maidens, where he may see me and
many other knights.’</p>
<p>With that came Sir Dinadan, and when he saw Sir Tristram wroth he
list not to jape.</p>
<p>‘Lo,’ said Sir Dinadan, ‘here may a man prove, be a man never so good
yet may he have a fall, and he was never so wise but he might be
overseen, and he rideth well that never fell.’</p>
<p>So Sir Tristram was passing wroth, and said to Sir Persides and to
Sir Dinadan, ‘I will revenge me.’</p>
<p>Right so as they stood talking there, there came by Sir Tristram a
likely knight riding passing soberly and heavily with a black
shield.</p>
<p>‘What knight is that?’ said Sir Tristram unto Sir Persides.</p>
<p>‘I know him well,’ said Sir Persides, ‘for his name is Sir Briant of
North Wales.’ So he passed on among other knights of North Wales.</p>
<p>And there came in Sir Launcelot du Lake with a shield of the arms of
Cornwall, and he sent a squire unto Sir Briant, and required him to
joust with him.</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Sir Briant, ‘sithen I am required to joust I will do
what I may.’</p>
<p>And there Sir Launcelot smote down Sir Briant from his horse a great
fall. And then Sir Tristram marvelled what knight he was that bare the
shield of Cornwall.</p>
<p>‘Whatsoever he be,’ said Sir Dinadan, ‘I warrant you he is of King
Ban’s blood, the which be knights of the most noble prowess in the
world, for to account so many for so many.’</p>
<p>Then there came two knights of Northgales, that one hight Hugh de la
Montaine, and the other Sir Maddock de la Montaine, and they challenged
Sir Launcelot foot hot. Sir Launcelot not refusing them but made him
ready, with one spear he smote them down both over their horse’s croups;
and so Sir Launcelot rode his way.</p>
<p>‘By the good lord,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘he is a good knight that
beareth the shield of Cornwall, and meseemeth he rideth in the best
manner that ever I saw knight ride.’</p>
<p>Then the King of Northgales rode unto Sir Palomides, and prayed him
heartily for his sake to ‘joust with that knight that hath done us of
Northgales despite.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Palomides, ‘I am full loth to have ado with that
knight, and cause why is, for as tomorn the great tournament shall be,
and therefore I will keep myself fresh by my will.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said the King of Northgales, ‘I pray you require him of
jousts.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Palomides, ‘I will joust at your request, and require
that knight to joust with me, and often I have seen a man have a fall at
his own request.’</p>
