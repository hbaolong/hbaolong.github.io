<h4 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h4>
<p>How Sir Launcelot slew two giants, and made a castle free</p>
<p>Anon withal came there upon him two great giants, well armed all save
the heads, with two horrible clubs in their hands. Sir Launcelot put his
shield afore him and put the stroke away of the one giant, and with his
sword he clave his head asunder. When his fellow saw that, he ran away
as he were wood, for fear of the horrible strokes, and Launcelot after
him with all his might, and smote him on the shoulder, and clave him to
the navel.</p>
<p>Then Sir Launcelot went into the hall, and there came afore him three
score ladies and damosels, and all kneeled unto him, and thanked God and
him of their deliverance. ‘For sir,’ said they, ‘the most part of us
have been here this seven year their prisoners, and we have worked all
manner of silk works for our meat, and we are all great gentlewomen
born. And blessed be the time, knight, that ever thou be born; for thou
hast done the most worship that ever did knight in this world, that will
we bear record, and we all pray you to tell us your name, that we may
tell our friends who delivered us out of prison.’</p>
<p>‘Fair damosel,’ he said, ‘my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, sir,’ said they all, ‘well mayest thou be he, for else save
yourself, as we deemed, there might never knight have the better of
these two giants; for many fair knights have assayed it, and here have
ended, and many times have we wished after you, and these two giants
dread never knight but you.’</p>
<p>‘Now may ye say,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘unto your friends how and who
hath delivered you, and greet them all from me, and if that I come in
any of your marches, show me such cheer as ye have cause, and what
treasure that there in this castle is I give it you for a reward for
your grievance. And the lord that is owner of this castle I would he
received it as is right.’</p>
<p>‘Fair sir,’ said they, ‘the name of this castle is Tintagel, and a
duke ought it sometime that had wedded fair Igraine and after wedded her
Uther Pendragon, and gat on her Arthur.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘I understand to whom this castle
belongeth;’ and so he departed from them, and betaught them unto
God.</p>
<p>And then he mounted upon his horse, and rode into many strange and
wild countries, and through many waters and valleys, and evil was he
lodged. And at the last by fortune him happened, against a night, to
come to a fair courtelage, and therein he found an old gentlewoman that
lodged him with good will, and there he had good cheer for him and his
horse. And when time was, his host brought him into a fair garret, over
the gate, to his bed. There Sir Launcelot unarmed him, and set his
harness by him, and went to bed, and anon he fell asleep.</p>
<p>So, soon after, there came one on horseback, and knocked at the gate
in great haste, and when Sir Launcelot heard this, he arose up and
looked out at the window, and saw by the moonlight three knights came
riding after that one man, and all three lashed on him at once with
swords, and that one knight turned on them knightly again, and defended
him.</p>
<p>‘Truly,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘yonder one knight shall I help, for it
were shame for me to see three knights on one. And if he be slain I am
partner of his death,’ and therewith he took his harness, and went out
at a window by a sheet down to the four knights, and then Sir Launcelot
said on high, ‘Turn you knights unto me, and leave your fighting with
that knight.’</p>
<p>And then they all three left Sir Kay, and turned unto Sir Launcelot,
and there began great battle, for they alit all three, and struck many
great strokes at Sir Launcelot, and assailed him on every side. Then Sir
Kay dressed him for to have holpen Sir Launcelot.</p>
<p>‘Nay, sir,’ said he, ‘I will none of your help; therefore as ye will
have my help, let me alone with them.’</p>
<p>Sir Kay, for the pleasure of the knight, suffered him for to do his
will, and so stood aside. And then anon within six strokes, Sir
Launcelot had stricken them to the earth. And then they all three cried,
‘Sir knight, we yield us unto you as man of might, makeless.’</p>
<p>‘As to that,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘I will not take your yielding unto
me. But so that ye will yield you unto Sir Kay the Seneschal, on that
covenant I will save your lives, and else not.’</p>
<p>‘Fair knight,’ said they, ‘that were we loth to do; for as for Sir
Kay, we chased him hither, and had overcome him had not ye been,
therefore to yield us unto him it were no reason.’</p>
<p>‘Well, as to that,’ said Launcelot, ‘advise you well, for ye may
choose whether ye will the or live, for and ye be yielden it shall be
unto Sir Kay.’</p>
<p>‘Fair knight,’ then they said, ‘in saving of our lives we will do as
thou commandest us.’</p>
<p>‘Then shall ye,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘on Whitsunday next coming, go
unto the court of King Arthur and there shall ye yield you unto Queen
Guenever, and put you all three in her grace and mercy, and say that Sir
Kay sent you thither to be her prisoners.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ they said, ‘it shall be done by the faith of our bodies, and
we be living,’ and there they swore every knight upon his sword.</p>
<p>And so Sir Launcelot suffered them so to depart. And then Sir
Launcelot knocked at the gate with the pommel of his sword, and with
that came his host, and in they entered Sir Kay and he.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said his host, ‘I weened ye had been in your bed.’</p>
<p>‘So I was,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘but I arose and leapt out at my
window for to help an old fellow of mine.’</p>
<p>And so when they came nigh the light, Sir Kay knew well that it was
Sir Launcelot, and therewith he kneeled down and thanked him of all his
kindness that he had holpen him twice from the death.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ he said, ‘I have nothing done but that me ought for to do, and
ye are welcome, and here shall ye repose you and take your rest.’</p>
<p>So when Sir Kay was unarmed, he asked after meat; so there was meat
fetched him, and he ate strongly. And when he had supped they went to
their beds and were lodged together in one bed.</p>
<p>On the morn Sir Launcelot arose early, and left Sir Kay sleeping, and
Sir Launcelot took Sir Kay’s armour and his shield, and armed him, and
so he went to the stable, and took his horse, and took his leave of his
host, and so he departed. Then soon after arose Sir Kay and missed Sir
Launcelot. And then he espied that he had his armour and his horse.</p>
<p>‘Now by my faith I know well that he will grieve some of the court of
King Arthur; for on him knights will be bold, and deem that it is I, and
that will beguile them. And because of his armour and shield I am sure I
shall ride in peace.’</p>
<p>And then soon after departed Sir Kay and thanked his host.</p>
<p>makeless: matchless.</p>
