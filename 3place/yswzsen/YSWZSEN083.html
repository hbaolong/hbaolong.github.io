<h4 id="chapter-21">Chapter 21</h4>
<p>How King Pelleas suffered himself to be taken prisoner because he
would have a sight of his lady, and How Sir Gawain promised him for to
get to him the love of his lady</p>
<p>‘And so he chose her for his sovereign lady, and never to love other
but her, but she was so proud that she had scorn of him, and said that
she would never love him though he would die for her. Wherefore all
ladies and gentlewomen had scorn of her that she was so proud, for there
were fairer than she, and there was none that was there but and Sir
Pelleas would have proffered them love, they would have loved him for
his noble prowess. And so this knight promised the lady Ettard to follow
her into this country, and never to leave her till she loved him. And
thus he is here the most part nigh her, and lodged by a priory, and
every week she sendeth knights to fight with him. And when he hath put
them to the worse, then will he suffer them wilfully to take him
prisoner, because he would have a sight of this lady. And always she
doth him great despite, for sometime she maketh her knights to tie him
to his horse’s tail, and some to bind him under the horse’s belly; thus
in the most shamefullest wise that she can think he is brought to her.
And all she doth it for to cause him to leave this country, and to leave
his loving; but all this cannot make him to leave, for and he would have
fought on foot he might have had the better of the ten knights as well
on foot as on horseback.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘it is great pity of him; and after this
night I will seek him tomorrow, in this forest, to do him all the help I
can.’</p>
<p>So on the morn Sir Gawain took his leave of his host Sir Carados, and
rode into the forest; and at the last he met with Sir Pelleas, making
great moan out of measure, so each of them saluted other, and asked him
why he made such sorrow. And as it is above rehearsed, Sir Pelleas told
Sir Gawain: ‘But always I suffer her knights to fare so with me as ye
saw yesterday, in trust at the last to win her love, for she knoweth
well all her knights should not lightly win me, and me list to fight
with them to the uttermost. Wherefore and I loved her not so sore, I had
lever die an hundred times, and I might die so oft, rather than I would
suffer that despite; but I trust she will have pity upon me at the last,
for love causeth many a good knight to suffer to have his intent, but
alas I am unfortunate.’ And therewith he made so great dole and sorrow
that unnethe he might hold him on horseback.</p>
<p>‘Now,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘leave your mourning and I shall promise you
by the faith of my body to do all that lieth in my power to get you the
love of your lady, and thereto I will plight you my troth.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said Sir Pelleas, ‘of what court are ye? Tell me, I pray you,
my good friend.’</p>
<p>And then Sir Gawain said, ‘I am of the court of King Arthur, and his
sister’s son, and King Lot of Orkney was my father, and my name is Sir
Gawain.’</p>
<p>And then he said, ‘My name is Sir Pelleas, born in the Isles, and of
many isles I am lord, and never have I loved lady nor damosel till now
in an unhappy time. And, sir knight, since ye are so nigh cousin unto
King Arthur, and a king’s son, therefore betray me not but help me, for
I may never come by her but by some good knight, for she is in a strong
castle here, fast by within this four mile, and over all this country
she is lady of. And so I may never come to her presence, but as I suffer
her knights to take me, and but if I did so that I might have a sight of
her, I had been dead long or this time. And yet fair word had I never of
her, but when I am brought tofore her she rebuketh me in the foulest
manner, and then they take my horse and harness and putten me out of the
gates, and she will not suffer me to eat nor drink; and always I offer
me to be her prisoner, but that she will not suffer me, for I would
desire no more, what pains so ever I had, so that I might have a sight
of her daily.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘all this shall I amend and ye will do as I
shall devise: I will have your horse and your armour, and so will I ride
unto her castle and tell her that I have slain you, and so shall I come
within her to cause her to cherish me, and then shall I do my true part
that ye shall not fail to have the love of her.’</p>
