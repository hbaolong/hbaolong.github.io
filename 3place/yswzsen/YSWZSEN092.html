<h4 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h4>
<p>How the kings and lords promised to King Arthur aid and help against
the Romans</p>
<p>Then answered King Agwisance of Scotland, ‘Sir, ye ought of right to
be above all other kings, for unto you is none like ne pareil in
Christendom, of knighthood ne of dignity, and I counsel you never to
obey the Romans, for when they reigned on us they distressed our elders,
and put this land to great extortions and tailles, wherefore I make here
mine avow to avenge me on them; and for to strength your quarrel I shall
furnish twenty thousand good men of war, and wage them on my costs,
which shall await on you with myself when it shall please you.’</p>
<p>And the King of Little Britain granted him to the same thirty
thousand; wherefore King Arthur thanked them. And then every man agreed
to make war, and to aid after their power, that is to wit, the Lord of
West Wales promised to bring thirty thousand men, and Sir Uwain, Sir
Idrus his son, with their cousins, promised to bring thirty thousand.
Then Sir Launcelot with all other promised in likewise every man a great
multitude. And when King Arthur understood their courages and good wills
he thanked them heartily, and after let call the ambassadors to hear
their answer. And in presence of all his lords and knights he said to
them in this wise:</p>
<p>‘I will that ye return unto your lord and Procuror of the Common Weal
for the Romans, and say ye to him, of his demand and commandment I set
nothing, and that I know of no truage ne tribute that I owe to him, ne
to none earthly prince, Christian ne heathen; but I pretend to have and
occupy the sovereignty of the empire, wherein I am entitled by the right
of my predecessors, sometime kings of this land; and say to him that I
am delibered and fully concluded, to go with mine army with strength and
power unto Rome, by the grace of God, to take possession in the empire
and subdue them that be rebel. Wherefore I command him and all them of
Rome, that incontinent they make to me their homage, and to acknowledge
me for their Emperor and Governor, upon pain that shall ensue.’</p>
<p>And then he commanded his treasurer to give to them great and large
gifts, and to pay all their dispenses, and assigned Sir Cador to convey
them out of the land.</p>
<p>And so they took their leave and departed, and took their shipping at
Sandwich, and passed forth by Flanders, Almain, the mountains, and all
Italy, until they came unto Lucius. And after the reverence made, they
made relation of their answer, like as ye tofore have heard.</p>
<p>When the Emperor Lucius had well understand their credence, he was
sore moved as he had been all araged, and said, ‘I had supposed that
Arthur would have obeyed to my commandment, and have served you himself,
as him well beseemed or any other king to do’</p>
<p>‘O Sir,’ said one of the senators, ‘let be such vain words, for we
let you wit that I and my fellows were full sore afeared to behold his
countenance. I fear me ye have made a rod for yourself, for he intendeth
to be lord of this empire, which sore is to be doubted if he come, for
he is all another man than ye ween, and holdeth the most noble court of
the world; all other kings ne princes may not compare unto his noble
mainten. On New Year’s Day we saw him in his estate, which was the
royallest that ever we saw, for he was served at his table with nine
kings, and the noblest fellowship of other princes, lords, and knights
that be in the world, and every knight approved and like a lord, and
holdeth Table Round; and in his person the most manly man that liveth,
and is like to conquer all the world, for unto his courage it is too
little. Wherefore I advise you to keep well your marches and straits in
the mountains; for certainly he is a lord to be doubted.’</p>
<p>‘Well’ said Lucius, ‘before Easter I suppose to pass the mountains,
and so forth into France, and there bereave him his lands with Genoese
and other mighty warriors of Tuscany and Lombardy. And I shall send for
them all that be subjects and allied to the empire of Rome to come to
mine aid’ and forthwith sent old wise knights unto these countries
following:</p>
<p>First to Ambage and Arrage, to Alexandria, to India, to Armenia,
whereas the river of Euphrates runneth into Asia, to Africa, and Europe
the Large, to Ertayne and Elamye, to Araby, Egypt, and to Damascus, to
Damietta and Cayer, to Cappadocia, to Tarsus, Turkey, Pontus and
Pamphylia to Syria and Galatia. And all these were subject to Rome and
many more, as Greece, Cyprus, Macedonia, Calabria, Cate-land,1 Portugal,
with many thousands of Spaniards. Thus all these kings, dukes, and
admirals, assembled about Rome, with sixteen kings at once, with great
multitude of people.</p>
<p>When the emperor understood their coming he made ready his Romans and
all the people between him and Flanders. Also he had gotten with him
fifty giants which had been engendered of fiends; and they were ordained
to guard his person, and to break the front of the battle of King
Arthur.</p>
<p>And thus departed from Rome, and came down the mountains for to
destroy the lands that Arthur had conquered, and came unto Cologne, and
besieged a castle thereby, and won it soon, and stuffed it with two
hundred Saracens or Infidels, and after destroyed many fair countries
which Arthur had won of King Claudas. And thus Lucius came with all his
host which were disperpled sixty mile in breadth, and commanded them to
meet with him in Burgundy, for he purposed to destroy the realm of
Little Britain.</p>
