<h4 id="chapter-32">Chapter 32</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palomides, and how he jousted with
King Arthur, and other feats</p>
<p>So the King of Northgales and the King with the Hundred Knights, they
two encountered with King Carados and with the King of Ireland; and
there the King with the Hundred Knights smote down King Carados, and the
King of Northgales smote down the King of Ireland.</p>
<p>With that came in Sir Palomides, and when he came he made great work,
for by his indented shield he was well known.</p>
<p>So came in King Arthur, and did great deeds of arms together, and put
the King of Northgales and the King with the Hundred Knights to the
worse.</p>
<p>With this came in Sir Tristram with his black shield, and anon he
jousted with Sir Palomides, and there by fine force Sir Tristram smote
Sir Palomides over his horse’s croup.</p>
<p>Then King Arthur cried, ‘Knight with the Black Shield, make thee
ready to me,’ and in the same wise Sir Tristram smote King Arthur.</p>
<p>And then by force of King Arthur’s knights the king and Sir Palomides
were horsed again. Then King Arthur with a great eager heart he gat a
spear in his hand and there upon the one side he smote Sir Tristram over
his horse.</p>
<p>Then foot-hot Sir Palomides came upon Sir Tristram, as he was upon
foot, to have overriden him. Then Sir Tristram was ware of him, and
there he stooped aside, and with great ire he gat him by the arm and
pulled him down from his horse.</p>
<p>Then Sir Palomides lightly arose, and then they dashed together
mightily with their swords; and many kings, queens, and lords, stood and
beheld them. And at the last Sir Tristram smote Sir Palomides upon the
helm three mighty strokes, and at every stroke that he gave him he said,
‘Have this for Sir Tristram’s sake.’ With that Sir Palomides fell to the
earth grovelling.</p>
<p>Then came the King with the Hundred Knights, and brought Sir Tristram
an horse, and so was he horsed again. By then was Sir Palomides horsed,
and with great ire he jousted upon Sir Tristram with his spear as it was
in the rest, and gave him a great dash with his sword. Then Sir Tristram
avoided his spear, and gat him by the neck with his both hands, and
pulled him clean out of his saddle, and so he bare him afore him the
length of ten spears, and then in the presence of them all he let him
fall at his adventure.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram was ware of King Arthur with a naked sword in his
hand, and with his spear Sir Tristram ran upon King Arthur; and then
King Arthur boldly abode him and with his sword he smote a-two his
spear, and therewithal Sir Tristram stonied; and so King Arthur gave him
three or four great strokes or he might get out his sword, and at the
last Sir Tristram drew his sword, and assailed other passing hard. With
that the great press departed.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram rode here and there and did his great pain, that
eleven of the good knights of the blood of King Ban, that was of Sir
Launcelot’s kin, that day Sir Tristram smote down, that all the estates
marvelled of his great deeds. and all cried upon the Knight with the
Black Shield.</p>
