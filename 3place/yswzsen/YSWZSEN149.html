<h4 id="chapter-29">Chapter 29</h4>
<p>Yet of the said tournament</p>
<p>Then when this was done there was drawing of swords, and then there
began a sore tournament. And there did Sir Lamorak marvellous deeds of
arms; and betwixt Sir Lamorak and Sir Ironside that was the Red Knight
of the Red Launds, there was strong battle; and betwixt Sir Palomides
and Bleoberis there was a strong battle; and Sir Gawain and Sir Tristram
met, and there Sir Gawain had the worse, for he pulled Sir Gawain from
his horse, and there he was long upon foot, and defiled.</p>
<p>Then came in Sir Launcelot, and he smote Sir Turquin, and he him; and
then came Sir Carados his brother, and both at once they assailed him,
and he as the most noblest knight of the world worshipfully fought with
them both, that all men wondered of the noblesse of Sir Launcelot.</p>
<p>And then came in Sir Gareth, and knew that it was Sir Launcelot that
fought with those two perilous knights. And then Sir Gareth came with
his good horse and hurtled them in-sunder, and no stroke would he smite
to Sir Launcelot. That espied Sir Launcelot, and deemed it should be the
good knight Sir Gareth; and then Sir Gareth rode here and there, and
smote on the right hand and on the left hand, that all the folk might
well espy where that he rode. And by fortune he met with his brother Sir
Gawain, and there he put Sir Gawain to the worse, for he put off his
helm, and so he served five or six knights of the Round Table, that all
men said he put him in the most pain, and best he did his devoir.</p>
<p>For when Sir Tristram beheld him how he first jousted and after
fought so well with a sword, then he rode unto Sir Ironside and to Sir
Persant of Inde, and asked them, by their faith, ‘What manner a knight
is yonder knight that seemeth in so many divers colours? Truly,
meseemeth,’ said Tristram, ‘that he putteth himself in great pain, for
he never ceaseth.’</p>
<p>‘Wot ye not what he is?’ said Sir Ironside.</p>
<p>‘No,’ said Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>‘Then shall ye know that this is he that loveth the lady of the
castle, and she him again; and this is he that won me when I besieged
the lady of this castle, and this is he that won Sir Persant of Inde,
and his three brethren.’</p>
<p>‘What is his name,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘and of what blood is he
come?’</p>
<p>‘He was called in the court of King Arthur, Beaumains, but his right
name is Sir Gareth of Orkney, brother to Sir Gawain.’</p>
<p>‘By my head,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘he is a good knight, and a big man
of arms, and if he be young he shall prove a full noble knight.’</p>
<p>‘He is but a child,’ they all said, ‘and of Sir Launcelot he was made
knight.’</p>
<p>‘Therefore he is mickle the better,’ said Tristram.</p>
<p>And then Sir Tristram, Sir Ironside, Sir Persant, and his brother,
rode together for to help Sir Gareth; and then there were given many
strong strokes.</p>
<p>And then Sir Gareth rode out on the one side to amend his helm; and
then said his dwarf, ‘Take me your ring, that ye lose it not while that
ye drink.’</p>
<p>And so when he had drunken he gat on his helm, and eagerly took his
horse and rode into the field, and left his ring with his dwarf; and the
dwarf was glad the ring was from him, for then he wist well he should be
known.</p>
<p>And then when Sir Gareth was in the field all folks saw him well and
plainly that he was in yellow colours; and there he rased off helms and
pulled down knights, that King Arthur had marvel what knight he was, for
the king saw by his hair that it was the same knight.</p>
<p>defiled: put to shame.</p>
