<h4 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h4>
<p>How King Arthur held in Wales, at a Pentecost, a great feast, and
what kings and lords came to his feast</p>
<p>Then the king removed into Wales, and let cry a great feast that it
should be holden at Pentecost after the incoronation of him at the city
of Caerleon. Unto the feast came King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney, with
five hundred knights with him. Also there came to the feast King Uriens
of Gore with four hundred knights with him. Also there came to that
feast King Nentres of Garlot, with seven hundred knights with him. Also
there came to the feast the King of Scotland with six hundred knights
with him, and he was but a young man. Also there came to the feast a
king that was called the King with the Hundred Knights, but he and his
men were passing well beseen at all points. Also there came the King of
Carados with five hundred knights.</p>
<p>And King Arthur was glad of their coming, for he weened that all the
kings and knights had come for great love, and to have done him worship
at his feast, wherefore the king made great joy, and sent the kings and
knights great presents. But the kings would none receive, but rebuked
the messengers shamefully, and said they had no joy to receive no gifts
of a beardless boy that was come of low blood, and sent him word they
would none of his gifts, but that they were come to give him gifts with
hard swords betwixt the neck and the shoulders; and therefore they came
thither, so they told to the messengers plainly, for it was great shame
to all them to see such a boy to have a rule of so noble a realm as this
land was. With this answer the messengers departed and told to King
Arthur this answer. Wherefore, by the advice of his barons, he took him
to a strong tower with five hundred good men with him; and all the kings
aforesaid in a manner laid a siege tofore him, but King Arthur was well
victualled.</p>
<p>And within fifteen days there came Merlin among them into the city of
Caerleon. Then all the kings were passing glad of Merlin, and asked him,
‘For what cause is that boy Arthur made your king?’</p>
<p>‘Sirs,’ said Merlin, ‘I shall tell you the cause, for he is King
Uther Pendragon’s son, born in wedlock, gotten on Igraine, the Duke’s
wife of Tintagel.’</p>
<p>‘Then is he a bastard,’ they said all.</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Merlin, ‘after the death of the duke, more than three
hours, was Arthur begotten, and thirteen days after, King Uther wedded
Igraine; and therefore I prove him he is no bastard, and who saith nay,
he shall be king and overcome all his enemies; and, or he die, he shall
be long king of all England, and have under his obeissance Wales,
Ireland, and Scotland, and more realms than I will now rehearse.’</p>
<p>Some of the kings had marvel of Merlin’s words, and deemed well that
it should be as he said; and some of them laughed him to scorn, as King
Lot; and more other called him a witch. But then were they accorded with
Merlin, that King Arthur should come out and speak with the kings, and
to come safe and to go safe, such surance there was made. So Merlin went
unto King Arthur, and told him how he had done, and bad him fear not,
‘but come out boldly and speak with them, and spare them not, but answer
them as their king and chieftain, for ye shall overcome them all,
whether they will or nill.’</p>
<p>holden: held. well beseen: good looking.</p>
