<h4 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h4>
<p>How Balin was pursued by Sir Lanceor, knight of Ireland, and how he
jousted and slew him</p>
<p>‘And so this Lady Lile of Avelion took her this sword that she
brought with her, and told there should no man pull it out of the sheath
but if he be one of the best knights of this realm, and he should be
hard and full of prowess, and with that sword he should slay her
brother. This was the cause that the damosel came into this court. I
know it as well as ye. Would God she had not comen into this court, but
she came never in fellowship of worship to do good, but always great
harm. And that knight that hath achieved the sword shall be destroyed by
that sword, for the which will be great damage for there liveth not a
knight of more prowess than he is, and he shall do unto you, my lord
Arthur, great honour and kindness; and it is great pity he shall not
endure but a while, for of his strength and hardiness I know not his
match living.’</p>
<p>So the knight of Ireland armed him at all points, and dressed his
shield on his shoulder, and mounted upon horseback, and took his spear
in his hand, and rode after a great pace, as much as his horse might go.
And within a little space on a mountain he had a sight of Balin, and
with a loud voice he cried, ‘Abide, knight, for ye shall abide whether
ye will or nill, and the shield that is tofore you shall not help.’</p>
<p>When Balin heard the noise, he turned his horse fiercely, and said,
‘Fair knight, what will ye with me, will ye joust with me?’</p>
<p>‘Yea,’ said the Irish knight, ‘therefore come I after you.’</p>
<p>‘Peradventure,’ said Balin, ‘it had been better to have held you at
home, for many a man weeneth to put his enemy to a rebuke, and oft it
falleth to himself. Of what court be ye sent from?’ said Balin.</p>
<p>‘I am come from the court of King Arthur,’ said the knight of
Ireland, ‘that come hither for to revenge the despite ye did this day to
King Arthur and to his court.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Balin, ‘I see well I must have ado with you; that me
forthinketh for to grieve King Arthur, or any of his court; and your
quarrel is full simple,’ said Balin, ‘unto me, for the lady that is dead
did me great damage, and else would I have been loth as any knight that
liveth for to slay a lady.’</p>
<p>‘Make you ready,’ said the knight Lanceor, ‘and dress you unto me,
for that one shall abide in the field.’</p>
<p>Then they took their spears, and came together as much as their
horses might drive, and the Irish knight smote Balin on the shield, that
all went shivers of his spear, and Balin hit him through the shield, and
the hauberk perished, and so pierced through his body and the horse’s
croup, and anon turned his horse fiercely, and drew out his sword, and
wist not that he had slain him; and then he saw him lie as a dead
corpse.</p>
<p>took her: gave her. damage: grief.</p>
