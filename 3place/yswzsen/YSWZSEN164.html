<h4 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram was put to the keeping of La Beale Isoud first for
to be healed of his wound</p>
<p>Then the king for great favour made Tramtrist to be put in his
daughter’s ward and keeping, because she was a noble surgeon. And when
she had searched him she found in the bottom of his wound that therein
was poison, and so she healed him within a while; and therefore
Tramtrist cast great love to La Beale Isoud, for she was at that time
the fairest maid and lady of the world. And there Tramtrist learned her
to harp, and she began to have a great fantasy unto him. And at that
time Sir Palomides, the Saracen, was in that country, and well cherished
with the king and the queen And every day Sir Palomides drew unto La
Beale Isoud and proffered her many gifts, for he loved her passingly
well. All that espied Tramtrist, and full well knew he Sir Palomides for
a noble knight and a mighty man. And wit ye well Sir Tramtrist had great
despite at Sir Palomides, for La Beale Isoud told Tramtrist that
Palomides was in will to be chrisened for her sake. Thus was there great
envy betwixt Tramtrist and Sir Palomides.</p>
<p>Then it befell that King Agwisance let cry a great jousts and a great
tournament for a lady that was called the Lady of the Launds, and she
was nigh cousin unto the king. And what man won her, three days after he
should wed her and have all her lands. This cry was made in England,
Wales, Scotland, and also in France and in Brittany.</p>
<p>It befell upon a day La Beale Isoud came unto Sir Tramtrist, and told
him of this tournament.</p>
<p>He answered and said, ‘Fair lady, I am but a feeble knight, and but
late I had been dead had not your good ladyship been. Now, fair lady,
what would ye I should do in this matter? Well ye wot, my lady, that I
may not joust.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, Tramtrist,’ said La Beale Isoud, ‘why will ye not have ado at
that tournament? Well I wot Sir Palomides shall be there, and to do what
he may; and therefore Tramtrist, I pray you for to be there, for else
Sir Palomides is like to win the degree.’</p>
<p>‘Madam,’ said Tramtrist, ‘as for that, it may be so, for he is a
proved knight, and I am but a young knight and late made; and the first
battle that I did it mishapped me to be sore wounded as ye see. But and
I wist ye would be my better lady, at that tournament I will be, so that
ye will keep my counsel and let no creature have knowledge that I shall
joust but yourself, and such as ye will to keep your counsel, my poor
person shall I jeopard there for your sake, that, per-adventure, Sir
Palomides shall know when that I come.’</p>
<p>‘Thereto,’ said La Beale Isoud, ‘do your best, and as I can,’ said La
Beale Isoud, ‘I shall purvey horse and armour for you at my device.’</p>
<p>‘As ye will so be it,’ said Sir Tramtrist, ‘I will be at your
commandment.’</p>
<p>So at the day of jousts there came Sir Palomides with a black shield,
and he overthrew many knights, that all the people had marvel of him.
For he put to the worse Sir Gawain, Gaheris, Agravain, Bagdemagus, Kay,
Dodinas le Savage, Sagramore le Desirous, Gumret le Petit, and Griflet
le Fise de Dieu. All these the first day Sir Palomides struck down to
the earth. And then all manner of knights were adread of Sir Palomides,
and many called him the Knight with the Black Shield. So that day Sir
Palomides had great worship.</p>
<p>Then came King Agwisance unto Tramtrist, and asked him why he would
not joust.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ he said, ‘I was but late hurt, and as yet I dare not adventure
me.’</p>
<p>Then came there the same squire that was sent from the king’s
daughter of France unto Sir Tristram. And when he had espied Sir
Tristram he fell flat to his feet. All that espied La Beale Isoud, what
courtesy the squire made unto Sir Tristram. And therewithal suddenly Sir
Tristram ran unto his squire, whose name was Hebes le Renoumes, and
prayed him heartily in no wise to tell his name.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Hebes, ‘I will not discover your name but if ye command
me.’</p>
