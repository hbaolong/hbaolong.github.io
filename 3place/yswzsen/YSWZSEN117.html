<h4 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h4>
<p>How Sir Launcelot came into the Chapel Perilous and gat there of a
dead corpse a piece of the cloth and a sword</p>
<p>Right so Sir Launcelot departed, and when he came unto the Chapel
Perilous he alit down, and tied his horse unto a little gate. And as
soon as he was within the churchyard he saw on the front of the chapel
many fair rich shields turned up-so-down, and many of the shields Sir
Launcelot had seen knights bear beforehand. With that he saw by him
there stand a thirty great knights, more by a yard than any man that
ever he had seen, and all those grinned and gnashed at Sir
Launcelot.</p>
<p>And when he saw their countenance he dread him sore, and so put his
shield afore him, and took his sword ready in his hand ready unto
battle, and they were all armed in black harness ready with their
shields and their swords drawn. And when Sir Launcelot would have gone
throughout them, they scattered on every side of him, and gave him the
way, and therewith he waxed all bold, and entered into the chapel, and
then he saw no light but a dim lamp burning, and then was he ware of a
corpse hilled with a cloth of silk.</p>
<p>Then Sir Launcelot stooped down, and cut a piece away of that cloth,
and then it fared under him as the earth had quaked a little;
therewithal he feared. And then he saw a fair sword lie by the dead
knight, and that he gat in his hand and hied him out of the chapel. Anon
as ever he was in the chapel yard all the knights spake to him with a
grimly voice, and said, ‘Knight Sir Launcelot, lay that sword from thee
or else thou shalt die.’</p>
<p>‘Whether that I live or die,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘with no great word
get ye it again, therefore fight for it and ye list.’</p>
<p>Then right so he passed throughout them, and beyond the chapel yard
there met him a fair damosel, and said, ‘Sir Launcelot, leave that sword
behind thee, or thou will die for it.’</p>
<p>‘I leave it not,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘for no treaties.’</p>
<p>‘No,’ said she, ‘and thou didst leave that sword, Queen Guenever
should thou never see.’</p>
<p>‘Then were I a fool and I would leave this sword,’ said
Launcelot.</p>
<p>‘Now, gentle knight’ said the damosel, ‘I require thee to kiss me but
once’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘that God me forbid.’</p>
<p>‘Well, sir,’ said she, ‘and thou hadst kissed me thy life days had
been done, but now, alas,’ she said, ‘I have lost all my labour, for I
ordained this chapel for thy sake, and for Sir Gawain. And once I had
Sir Gawain within me, and at that time he fought with that knight that
lieth there dead in yonder chapel, Sir Gilbert the Bastard; and at that
time he smote the left hand off of Sir Gilbert the Bastard. And, Sir
Launcelot, now I tell thee, I have loved thee this seven year, but there
may no woman have thy love but Queen Guenever. But sithen I may not
rejoice thee to have thy body alive, I had kept no more joy in this
world but to have thy body dead. Then would I have balmed it and served
it, and so have kept it my life days, and daily I should have clipped
thee, and kissed thee, in despite of Queen Guenever.’</p>
<p>‘Ye say well,’ said Sir Launcelot. ‘Jesu preserve me from your subtle
crafts.’</p>
<p>And therewithal he took his horse and so departed from her. And as
the book saith, when Sir Launcelot was departed she took such sorrow
that she died within a fourteen night, and her name was Hellawes the
sorceress, Lady of the Castle Nigramous.</p>
<p>Anon Sir Launcelot met with the damosel, Sir Meliot’s sister. And
when she saw him she clapped her hands, and wept for joy. And then they
rode unto a castle thereby where lay Sir Meliot. And anon as Sir
Launcelot saw him he knew him, but he was passing pale as the earth for
bleeding.</p>
<p>When Sir Meliot saw Sir Launcelot he kneeled upon his knees and cried
on high, ‘O lord Sir Launcelot, help me!’</p>
<p>Anon Sir Launcelot leapt unto him and touched his wounds with Sir
Gilbert’s sword. And then he wiped his wounds with a part of the bloody
cloth that Sir Gilbert was wrapped in, and anon an wholer man in his
life was he never.</p>
<p>And then there was great joy between them, and they made Sir
Launcelot all the cheer that they might, and so on the morn Sir
Launcelot took his leave, and bad Sir Meliot hie him ‘to the court of my
lord Arthur, for it draweth nigh to the feast of Pentecost, and there by
the grace of God ye shall find me.’ And therewith they departed.</p>
