<h4 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h4>
<p>How Beaumains fought with the Knight of the Black Launas, and fought
with him till he fell down and died</p>
<p>There sat 〔a〕 knight all armed in black harness, and his name was
the Knight of the Black Launds. Then the damosel, when she saw that
knight, she bad him flee down that valley, for his horse was not
saddled.</p>
<p>‘Gramercy,’ said Beaumains, ‘for always ye would have me a
coward.’</p>
<p>With that the Black Knight, when she came nigh him, spake and said,
‘Damosel, have ye brought this knight of King Arthur to be your
champion?’</p>
<p>‘Nay, fair knight,’ said she, ‘this is but a kitchen knave that was
fed in King Arthur’s kitchen for alms.’</p>
<p>‘Why cometh he,’ said the knight, ‘in such array? It is shame that he
beareth you company.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, I cannot be delivered of him,’ said she, ‘for with me he rideth
maugre mine head. God would that ye should put him from me, other to
slay him and ye may, for he is an unhappy knave, and unhappily he hath
done this day: through mishap I saw him slay two knights at the passage
of the water; and other deeds he did before right marvellous and through
un-happiness.’</p>
<p>‘That marvelleth1 me,’ said the Black Knight, ‘that any man that is
of worship will have ado with him.’</p>
<p>‘They know him not,’ said the damosel, ‘and for because he rideth
with me, they ween that he be some man of worship born.’</p>
<p>‘That may be,’ said the Black Knight; ‘howbeit as ye say that he be
no man of worship, he is a full likely person, and full like to be a
strong man. But thus much shall I grant you,’ said the Black Knight; ‘I
shall put him down upon one foot, and his horse and his harness he shall
leave with me, for it were shame to me to do him any more harm.’</p>
<p>When Sir Beaumains heard him say thus, he said, ‘Sir knight, thou art
full large of my horse and my harness; I let thee wit it cost thee
nought, and whether it liketh thee or not, this laund will I pass maugre
thine head. And horse ne harness gettest thou none of mine, but if thou
win them with thy hands; and therefore let see what thou canst do.’</p>
<p>‘Sayest thou that?’ said the Black Knight, ‘Now yield thy lady from
thee, for it beseemeth never a kitchen page to ride with such a
lady.’</p>
<p>‘Thou liest,’ said Beaumains, ‘I am a gentleman born, and of more
high lineage than thou, and that will I prove on thy body.’</p>
<p>Then in great wrath they departed with their horses, and came
together as it had been the thunder, and the Black Knight’s spear brake,
and Beaumains thrust him through both his sides, and therewith his spear
brake, and the truncheon left still in his side. But nevertheless the
Black Knight drew his sword, and smote many eager strokes, and of great
might, and hurt Beaumains full sore. But at the last the Black Knight,
within an hour and an half, he fell down off his horse in swoon, and
there he died.</p>
<p>And then Beaumains saw him so well horsed and armed, then he alit
down and armed him in his armour, and so took his horse and rode after
the damosel.</p>
<p>When she saw him come nigh, she said, ‘Away, kitchen knave, out of
the wind, for the smell of thy bawdy clothes grieveth me. Alas,’ she
said, ‘that ever such a knave should by mishap slay so good a knight as
thou hast done, but all this is thine unhappiness. But here by is one
shall pay thee all thy payment, and therefore yet I counsel thee
flee.’</p>
<p>‘It may happen me,’ said Beaumains, ‘to be beaten or slain, but I
warn you, fair damosel, I will not flee away, nor leave your company,
for all that ye can say; for ever ye say that they will kill me or beat
me, but howsomever it happeneth I escape, and they lie on the ground.
And therefore it were as good for you to hold you still thus all day
rebuking me, for away will I not till I see the uttermost of this
journey, or else I will be slain, other truly beaten; therefore ride on
your way, for follow you I will whatsomever happen.’</p>
<p>mishaply: by misfortune, reck: care.</p>
