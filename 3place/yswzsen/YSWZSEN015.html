<h4 id="chapter-14">Chapter 14</h4>
<p>How the eleven kings with their host fought against Arthur and his
host, and many great feats of the war</p>
<p>Then King Arthur and King Ban and King Bors, with their good and
trusty knights, set on them so fiercely that he made them overthrow
their pavilions on their heads, but the eleven kings, by manly prowess
of arms, took a fair champaign, but there was slain that morrowtide ten
thousand good men’s bodies. And so they had afore them a strong passage,
yet were they fifty thousand of hardy men. Then it drew toward day.</p>
<p>‘Now shall ye do by mine advice,’ said Merlin unto the three kings:
‘I would that King Ban and King Bors, with their fellowship of ten
thousand men, were put in a wood here beside, in an ambushment, and keep
them privy, and that they be laid or the light of the day come, and that
they stir not till ye and your knights have fought with them long. And
when it is daylight, dress your battle even afore them and the passage,
that they may see all your host, for then will they be the more hardy,
when they see you but about twenty thousand, and cause them to be the
gladder to suffer you and your host to come over the passage.’ All the
three kings and the whole barons said that Merlin said passingly well,
and it was done anon as Merlin had devised.</p>
<p>So on the morn, when either host saw other, the host of the north was
well comforted. Then to Ulfius and Brastias were delivered three
thousand men of arms, and they set on them fiercely in the passage, and
slew on the right hand and on the left hand that it was wonder to tell.
When that the eleven kings saw that there was so few a fellowship did
such deeds of arms, they were ashamed and set on them again fiercely.
And there was Sir Ulfius’ horse slain under him, but he did marvellously
well on foot. But the Duke Eustace of Cambenet and King Clarivaus of
Northumberland were alway grievous on Ulfius. Then Brastias saw his
fellow fared so withal, he smote the duke with a spear, that horse and
man fell down. That saw King Clarivaus and returned unto Brastias, and
either smote other so that horse and man went to the earth, and so they
lay long astonied, and their horses’ knees brast to the hard bone.</p>
<p>Then came Sir Kay the Seneschal with six fellows with him, and did
passing well. With that came the eleven kings, and there was Griflet put
to the earth, horse and man, and Lucan the Butler, horse and man, by
King Brandegoris, and King Idres, and King Agwisance. Then waxed the
medley passing hard on both parties.</p>
<p>When Sir Kay saw Griflet on foot, he rode on King Nentres and smote
him down, and led his horse unto Sir Griflet, and horsed him again. Also
Sir Kay with the same spear smote down King Lot, and hurt him passing
sore. That saw the King with the Hundred Knights, and ran unto Sir Kay
and smote him down, and took his horse, and gave him King Lot, whereof
he said ‘Gramercy’. When Sir Griflet saw Sir Kay and Lucan the Butler on
foot, he took a sharp spear, great and square, and rode to Pinel, a good
man of arms, and smote horse and man down, and then he took his horse,
and gave him unto Sir Kay.</p>
<p>Then King Lot saw King Nentres on foot, he ran unto Melot de la
Roche, and smote him down, horse and man, and gave King Nentres the
horse, and horsed him again. Also the King of the Hundred Knights saw
King Idres on foot, then he ran unto Gwinas de Bloi, and smote him down,
horse and man, and gave King Idres the horse, and horsed him again; and
King Lot smote down Clariance de la Forest Savage, and gave the horse
unto Duke Eustace. And so when they had horsed the kings again they drew
them all eleven kings together, and said they would be revenged of the
damage that they had taken that day.</p>
<p>The meanwhile came in Sir Ector with an eager countenance, and found
Ulfius and Brastias on foot, in great peril of death, that were foul
defiled under horse feet. Then King Arthur as a lion ran unto King
Cradelment of North Wales, and smote him through the left side, that the
horse and the king fell down; and then he took the horse by the rein,
and led him unto Ulfius, and said, ‘Have this horse, mine old friend,
for great need hast thou of horse.’</p>
<p>‘Gramercy,’ said Ulfius.</p>
<p>Then Sir Arthur did so marvellously in arms, that all men had wonder.
When the King with the Hundred Knights saw King Cradelment on foot, he
ran unto Sir Ector, that was well horsed, Sir Kay’s father, and smote
horse and man down, and gave the horse unto the king, and horsed him
again; and when King Arthur saw the king ride on Sir Ector’s horse, he
was wroth and with his sword he smote the king on the helm, that a
quarter of the helm and shield fell down, and the sword carved down unto
the horse’s neck, and so the king and the horse fell down to the ground.
Then Sir Kay came unto Sir Morganor, seneschal with the King of the
Hundred Knights, and smote him down, horse and man, and led the horse
unto his father, Sir Ector; then Sir Ector ran unto a knight, hight
Lardans, and smote horse and man down, and led the horse unto Sir
Brastias, that great need had of an horse, and was greatly defiled. When
Brastias beheld Lucan the Butler, that lay like a dead man under the
horse’s feet, and ever Sir Griflet did marvellously for to rescue him,
and there were always fourteen knights on Sir Lucan, and then Brastias
smote one of them on the helm, that it went to the teeth, and he rode to
another and smote him, that the arm flew into the field; then he went to
the third and smote him on the shoulder, that shoulder and arm flew in
the field. And when Griflet saw rescues, he smote a knight on the
temples, that head and helm went to the earth, and Griflet took the
horse of that knight, and led him unto Sir Lucan, and bad him mount upon
the horse and revenge his hurts. For Brastias had slain a knight tofore
and horsed Griflet.</p>
