<h4 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h4>
<p>How Sir Launcelot rode disguised in Sir Kay’s harness, and how he
smote down a knight</p>
<p>Now turn we unto Sir Launcelot that had ridden long in a great
forest, and at the last he came into a low country, full of fair rivers
and meadows. And afore him he saw a long bridge, and three pavilions
stood thereon, of silk and sendal of divers hue. And without the
pavilion hung three white shields on truncheons of spears, and great
long spears stood upright by the pavilions, and at every pavilion’s door
stood three fresh squires. And so Sir Launcelot passed by them and spake
no word.</p>
<p>When he was passed the three knights saiden him that it was the proud
Kay: ‘He weeneth no knight so good as he. and the contrary is of time
proved.’</p>
<p>‘By my faith,’ said one of the knights, his name was Sir Gauter, ‘I
will ride after him and assay him for all his pride, and ye may behold
how that I speed.’</p>
<p>So this knight, Sir Gauter, armed him, and hung his shield upon his
shoulder, and mounted upon a great horse, and gat his spear in his hand,
and walloped after Sir Launcelot. And when he came nigh him, he cried,
‘Abide, thou proud knight Sir Kay, for thou shalt not pass quit.’</p>
<p>So Sir Launcelot turned him, and either fewtered their spears, and
came together with all their mights, and Sir Gauter’s spear brake, but
Sir Launcelot smote him down horse and man.</p>
<p>And when Sir Gauter was at the earth his brethren said each one to
other, ‘Yonder knight is not Sir Kay, for he is bigger than he.’</p>
<p>‘I dare lay my head,’ said Sir Gilmere, ‘yonder knight hath slain Sir
Kay and hath taken his horse and his harness.’</p>
<p>‘Whether it be so or no,’ said Sir Arnold, the third brother, ‘let us
now go mount upon our horses and rescue our brother Sir Gauter, upon
pain of death. We all shall have work enough to match that knight, for
ever mesecmeth by his person it is Sir Launcelot, or Sir Tristram, or
Sir Pelleas, the good knight.’</p>
<p>Then anon they took their horses and overtook Sir Launcelot, and Sir
Gilmere put forth his spear, and ran to Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot
smote him down that he lay in a swoon.</p>
<p>‘Sir knight’ said Sir Arnold, ‘thou art a strong man, and as I
suppose thou hast slain my two brethren, for the which riseth my heart
sore against thee. And if I might with my worship I would not have ado
with you, but needs I must take part as they do, and therefore, knight,’
he said, ‘keep thyself.’</p>
<p>And so they hurtled together with all their mights, and all
to-shivered both their spears. And then they drew their swords and
lashed together eagerly.</p>
<p>Anon therewith arose Sir Gauter, and came unto his brother Sir
Gilmere, and bad him, ‘Arise, and help we our brother Sir Arnold, that
yonder marvellously matched yonder good knight.’</p>
<p>Therewithal, they leapt on their horses and hurtled unto Sir
Launcelot. And when he saw them come he smote a sore stroke unto Sir
Arnold, that he fell off his horse to the ground, and then he struck to
the other two brethren, and at two strokes he strake them down to the
earth.</p>
<p>With that Sir Arnold began to start up with his head all bloody, and
came straight unto Sir Launcelot.</p>
<p>‘Now let be,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘I was not far from thee when thou
were made knight, Sir Arnold, and also I know thou art a good knight,
and loth I were to slay thee.’</p>
<p>‘Gramercy,’ said Sir Arnold, ‘as for your goodness; and I dare say as
for me and my brethren, we will not be loth to yield us unto you, with
that we knew your name, for well we know ye are not Sir Kay.’</p>
<p>‘As for that be it as it be may, for ye shall yield you unto Dame
Guenever, and look that ye be with her on Whitsunday, and yield you unto
her as prisoners, and say that Sir Kay sent you unto her.’</p>
<p>Then they swore it should be done, and so passed forth Sir Launcelot,
and each one of the brethren halp other as well as they might.</p>
