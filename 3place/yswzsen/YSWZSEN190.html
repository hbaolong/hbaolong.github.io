<h4 id="chapter-35">Chapter 35</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram was holpen by his men, and of Queen Isoud which was
put in a lazar-cote, and how Tristram was hurt</p>
<p>So when they were departed, Gouvernail, and Sir Lambegus, and Sir
Sentraille de Lushon, that were Sir Tristram’s men, sought their master.
When they heard he was escaped then they were passing glad; and on the
rocks they found him, and with towels they pulled him up. And then Sir
Tristram asked them where was La Beale Isoud, for he weened she had been
had away of Andred’s people.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Gouvernail, ‘she is put in a lazar-cote.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘this is a full ungoodly place for such a
fair lady, and if I may she shall not be long there.’</p>
<p>And so he took his men and went thereas was La Beale Isoud, and
fetched her away, and brought her into a forest to a fair manor, and Sir
Tristram there abode with her.</p>
<p>So the good knight bad his men go from him: ‘For at this time I may
not help you.’ So they departed all save Gouvernail.</p>
<p>And so upon a day Sir Tristram yede into the forest for to disport
him, and then it happened that there he fell asleep; and there came a
man that Sir Tristram aforehand had slain his brother, and when this man
had found him he shot him through the shoulder with an arrow, and Sir
Tristram leapt up and killed that man.</p>
<p>And in the meantime it was told King Mark how Sir Tristram and La
Beale Isoud were in that same manor, and as soon as ever he might
thither he came with many knights to slay Sir Tristram. And when he came
there he found him gone; and there he took La Beale Isoud home with him,
and kept her strait that by no mean never she might wit nor send unto
Tristram, nor he unto her.</p>
<p>And then when Sir Tristram came toward the old manor he found the
track of many horses, and thereby he wist his lady was gone. And then
Sir Tristram took great sorrow, and endured with great pain long time,
for the arrow that he was hurt withal was envenomed.</p>
<p>Then by the mean of La Beale Isoud she told a lady that was cousin
unto Dame Bragwaine, and she came to Sir Tristram, and told him that he
might not be whole by no means: ‘For thy lady, La Beale Isoud, may not
help thee, therefore she biddeth you haste into Brittany to King Howel,
and there ye shall find his daughter, Isoud la Blanche Mains, and she
shall help thee.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram and Gouvernail gat them shipping, and so sailed
into Brittany. And when King Howel wist that it was Sir Tristram he was
full glad of him.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ he said, ’I am comen into this country to have help of your
daughter, for it is told me that there is none other may heal me but
she.</p>
<p>And so within a while she healed him.</p>
<p>unwrast: wrenched free. wrothe: twisted.</p>
<p>lazar-cote: hut for lepers.</p>
