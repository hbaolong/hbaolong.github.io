<h4 id="chapter-32">Chapter 32</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram brought Queen Isoud home, and of the debate of King
Mark and Sir Tristram</p>
<p>And so Sir Palomides departed with great heaviness. And Sir Tristram
took the queen and broùght her again to King Mark, and then was there
made great joy of her homecoming. Who was cherished but Sir
Tristram!</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram let fetch Sir Lambegus, his knight, from the
forester’s house, and it was long or he was whole, but at last he was
well recovered. Thus they lived with joy and play a long while. But ever
Sir Andred, that was nigh cousin to Sir Tristram, lay in a watch to wait
betwixt Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud, for to take them and slander
them.</p>
<p>So upon a day Sir Tristram talked with La Beale Isoud in a window,
and that espied Sir Andred, and told it to the king. Then King Mark took
a sword in his hand and came to Sir Tristram, and called him false
traitor, and would have stricken him. But Sir Tristram was nigh him, and
ran under his sword, and took it out of his hand.</p>
<p>And then the king cried, ‘Where are my knights and my men? I charge
you slay this traitor.’</p>
<p>But at that time there was not one would move for his words.</p>
<p>When Sir Tristram saw that there was not one would be against him, he
shook the sword to the king, and made countenance as though he would
have striken him. And then King Mark fled, and Sir Tristram followed
him, and smote upon him five or six strokes flatling on the neck, that
he made him to fall upon the nose.</p>
<p>And then Sir Tristram yede his way and armed him, and took his horse
and his men, and so he rode into that forest. And there upon a day Sir
Tristram met with two brethren that were knights with King Mark, and
there he struck off the head of the one, and wounded the other to the
death; and he made him to bear his brother’s head in his helm unto the
king, and thirty more there he wounded. And when that knight came before
the king to say his message, he there died afore the king and the queen.
Then King Mark called his council unto him, and asked advice of his
barons what was best to do with Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the barons, in especial Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, ‘Sir,
we will give you counsel for to send for Sir Tristram, for we will that
ye wit many men will hold with Sir Tristram and he were hard
bestad.’</p>
<p>‘And sir,’ said Sir Dinas, ‘ye shall understand that Sir Tristram is
called peerless and makeless of any Christian knight, and of his might
and hardiness we knew none so good a knight, but if it be Sir Launcelot
du Lake. And if he depart from your court and go to King Arthur’s court,
wit ye well he will get him such friends there that he will not set by
your malice. And therefore, sir, I counsel you to take him to your
grace.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said the king, ‘that he be sent for, that we may be
friends.’</p>
<p>Then the barons sent for Sir Tristram under a safe conduct. And so
when Sir Tristram came to the king he was welcome, and no rehearsal was
made, and there was game and play. And then the king and queen went on
hunting, and Sir Tristram.</p>
