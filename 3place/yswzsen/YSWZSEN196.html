<h4 id="chapter-41">Chapter 41</h4>
<p>How Sir Lamorak slew Sir Froll, and of the courteous fighting with
Sir Belliance his brother</p>
<p>Then within two or three days Sir Lamorak found a knight at a well
sleeping, and his lady sat with him and waked. Right so came Sir Gawain
and took the knight’s lady, and set her up behind his squire.</p>
<p>So Sir Lamorak rode after Sir Gawain, and said, ‘Sir Gawain, turn
again.’</p>
<p>And then said Sir Gawain, ‘What will ye do with me? For I am nephew
unto King Arthur.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said he, ‘for that cause I will spare you, else that lady
should abide with me, or else ye should joust with me.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Gawain turned him and ran to him that ought the lady, with
his spear, but the knight with pure might smote down Sir Gawain, and
took his lady with him.</p>
<p>All this Sir Lamorak saw, and said to himself, ‘But I revenge my
fellow he will say of me dishonour in King Arthur’s court.’ Then Sir
Lamorak returned and proffered that knight to joust.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said he, ‘I am ready.’</p>
<p>And there they came together with all their might, and there Sir
Lamorak smote the knight through both sides that he fell to the earth
dead.</p>
<p>Then that lady rode to that knight’s brother that hight Belliance le
Orgulus, that dwelt fast thereby, and then she told him how his brother
was slain.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said he, ‘I will be revenged.’</p>
<p>And so he horsed him, and armed him, and within a while he overtook
Sir Lamorak, and bad him: ‘Turn and leave that lady, for thou and I must
play a new play; for thou hast slain my brother Sir Froll, that was a
better knight than ever were thou.’</p>
<p>‘It might well be,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘but this day in the field I
was found the better.’</p>
<p>So they rode together, and unhorsed other, and turned their shields,
and drew their swords, and fought mightily as noble knights proved, by
the space of two hours. So then Sir Belliance prayed him to tell him his
name.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said he, ‘my name is Sir Lamorak de Gales.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said Sir Belliance, ‘thou art the man in the world that I most
hate, for I slew my sons for thy sake, where I saved thy life, and now
thou hast slain my brother Sir Froll. Alas, how should I be accorded
with thee; therefore defend thee, for thou shalt die, there is none
other remedy.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘full well me ought to know you, for ye are
the man that most have done for me.’ And there-withal Sir Lamorak
kneeled down and besought him of grace.</p>
<p>‘Arise,’ said Sir Belliance, ‘or else there as thou kneelest I shall
slay thee.’</p>
<p>‘That shall not need,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘for I will yield me unto
you, not for fear of you, nor for your strength, but your goodness
maketh me full loth to have ado with you; wherefore I require you for
God’s sake, and for the honour of knighthood, forgive me all that I have
offended unto you.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Belliance, ‘leave thy kneeling, or else I shall slay
thee without mercy.’</p>
<p>Then they yede again unto battle, and either wounded other, that all
the ground was bloody there as they fought. And at the last Belliance
withdrew him aback and set him down softly upon a little hill, for he
was so faint for bleeding that he might not stand. Then Sir Lamorak
threw his shield upon his back, and asked him what cheer.</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Sir Belliance.</p>
<p>‘Ah, sir, yet shall I show you favour in your mal-ease.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, knight,’ Sir Belliance said, ‘Sir Lamorak, thou art a fool, for
and I had had thee at such advantage as thou hast done me, I should slay
thee; but thy gentleness is so good and so large, that I must needs
forgive thee mine evil will.’</p>
<p>And then Sir Lamorak kneeled down, and unlaced first his umberere,
and then his own, and then either kissed other with weeping tears. Then
Sir Lamorak led Sir Belliance to an abbey fast by, and there Sir Lamorak
would not depart from Belliance till he was whole. And then they sware
together that none of them should never fight against other.</p>
<p>So Sir Lamorak departed and went to the court of King Arthur.</p>
<p>Here leave we of Sir Lamorak</p>
<p>and of Sir Tristram. And</p>
<p>here beginneth the history</p>
<p>of La Cote Male Taile.</p>
