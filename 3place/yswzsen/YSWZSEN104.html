<h4 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h4>
<p>How Sir Ector followed for to seek Sir Launcelot, and how he was
taken by Sir Turquin</p>
<p>When Sir Ector de Maris wist that Sir Launcelot was passed out of the
court to seek adventures, he was wroth with himself, and made him ready
to seek Sir Launcelot, and as he had ridden long in a great forest he
met with a man was like a forester. ‘Fair fellow’ said Sir Ector,
‘knowest thou in this county any adventures that be here nigh hand?’</p>
<p>‘Sir’ said the forester, ‘this country know I well, and hereby,
within this mile, is a strong manor, and well dyked, and by that manor,
on the left hand, there is a fair ford for horses to drink of, and over
that ford there groweth a fair tree, and thereon hangen many fair
shields that wielded sometime good knights, and at the hole of the tree
hangeth a basin of copper and laton, and strike upon that basin with the
butt of thy spear thrice, and soon after thou shalt hear new tidings,
and else hast thou the fairest grace that many a year had ever knight
that passed through this forest’</p>
<p>‘Gramercy,’ said, Sir Ector, and departed and came to the tree, and
saw many fair shields.</p>
<p>And among them he saw his brother’s shield, Sir Lionel, and many more
that he knew that were his fellows of the Round Table, the which grieved
his heart, and promised to revenge his brother. Then anon Sir Ector beat
on the basin as he were wood, and then he gave his horse drink at the
ford, and there came a knight behind him and bad him come out of the
water and make him ready; and Sir Ector anon turned him shortly, and in
fewter cast his spear, and smote the other knight a great buffet that
his horse turned twice about.</p>
<p>‘This was well done’, said the strong knight, ‘and knightly thou hast
stricken me;’ and therewith he rushed his horse on Sir Ector and cleyght
him under his right arm, and bare him clean out of the saddle, and rode
with him away into his own hall, and threw him down in midst of the
floor. The name of this knight was Sir Turquin.</p>
<p>Then he said unto Sir Ector, ‘For thou hast done this day more unto
me than any knight did these twelve years, now will I grant thee thy
life so thou wilt be sworn to be my prisoner all thy life days.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Ector, ‘that will I never promise thee, but that I
will do mine advantage.’</p>
<p>‘That me repenteth,’ said Sir Turquin.</p>
<p>And then he gart to unarm him, and beat him with thorns all naked,
and sithen put him down in a deep dungeon, where he knew many of his
fellows. But when Sir Ector saw Sir Lionel, then made he great
sorrow.</p>
<p>‘Alas, brother’ said Sir Ector, ‘where is my brother, Sir
Launcelot?’</p>
<p>‘Fair brother, I left him asleep when that I from him yode, under an
apple tree; and what is become of him I cannot tell you.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said the knights, ‘but Sir Launcelot help us we may never be
delivered, for we know now no knight that is able to match our master
Turquin.’</p>
<p>fewter: rest for a spear, cleyght: seized.</p>
