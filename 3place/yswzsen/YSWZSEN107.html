<h4 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h4>
<p>5: How a knight found Sir Launcelot lying in his leman’s bed, and how
Sir Launcelot fought with the knight</p>
<p>Then within an hour there came the knight to whom the pavilion ought,
and he weened that his leman had lain in that bed, and so he laid him
down beside Sir Launcelot, and took him in his arms and began to kiss
him.</p>
<p>And when Sir Launcelot felt a roùgh beard kissing him, he start out
of the bed lightly, and the other knight after him, and either of them
gat their swords in their hands, and out at the pavilion door went the
knight of the pavilion, and Sir Launcelot followed him, and there by a
little slake Sir Launcelot wounded him sore, nigh unto the death. And
then he yielded him unto Sir Launcelot, and so he granted him, so that
he would tell him why he came in to the bed.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the knight, ‘the pavilion is mine own, and there this
night I had assigned my lady to have slept with me, and now I am likely
to die of this wound.’</p>
<p>‘That me repenteth,’ said Launcelot, ‘of your hurt, but I was adread
of treason, for I was late beguiled, and therefore come on your way into
your pavilion and take your rest, and as I suppose I shall staunch your
blood.’</p>
<p>And so they went both into the pavilion, and anon Sir Launcelot
staunched his blood. Therewithal came the knight’s lady, that was a
passing fair lady, and when she espied that her lord Belleus was sore
wounded, she cried out on Sir Launcelot, and made great dole out of
measure.</p>
<p>‘Peace, my lady and my love’ said Belleus, ‘for this knight is a good
man, and a knight adventurous.’ and there he told her all the cause how
he was wounded; ‘And when that I yielded me unto him, he left me goodly
and hath staunched my blood.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the lady, ‘I require thee tell me what knight ye be, and
what is your name?’</p>
<p>‘Fair lady’, he said, ‘my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake.’</p>
<p>‘So me thought ever by your speech,’ said the lady, ‘for I have seen
you oft or this, and I know you better than ye ween. But now and ye
would promise me of your courtesy, for the harms that ye have done to me
and to my lord Belleus, that when he cometh unto Arthur’s court for to
cause him to be made knight of the Round Table, for he is a passing good
man of arms, and a mighty lord of lands of many out isles.’</p>
<p>‘Fair lady,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘let him come unto the court the
next high feast, and look that ye come with him, and I shall do my
power, and ye prove you doughty of your hands, that ye shall have your
desire.’</p>
<p>So thus within a while as they thus talked the night passed, and the
day shone, and then Sir Launcelot armed him, and took his horse, and
they taught him to the abbey, and thither he rode within the space of
two hours.</p>
<p>ought: belonged, slake: ravine.</p>
