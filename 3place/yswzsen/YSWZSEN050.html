<h4 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h4>
<p>How a poor man riding upon a lean mare desired of King Arthur to make
his son knight</p>
<p>Forthwithal there came a poor man into the court, and brought with
him a fair young man of eighteen year of age riding upon a lean mare;
and the poor man asked all men that he met, ‘Where shall I find King
Arthur?’</p>
<p>‘Yonder he is,’ said the knights, ‘wilt thou anything with him?’</p>
<p>‘Yea,’ said the poor man, ‘therefore I came hither.’</p>
<p>Anon as he came before the king, he saluted him and said, ‘O King
Arthur, the flower of all knights and kings, I beseech Jesu save thee.
Sir, it was told me that at this time of your marriage ye would give any
man the gift that he would ask, out except that were unreasonable.’</p>
<p>‘That is truth,’ said the king, ‘such cries I let make, and that will
I hold, so it appair not my realm nor mine estate.’</p>
<p>‘Ye say well and graciously,’ said the poor man. ‘Sir, I ask nothing
else but that ye will make my son here a knight.’</p>
<p>‘It is a great thing thou askest of me,’ said the king. ‘What is thy
name?’ said the king to the poor man.</p>
<p>‘Sir, my name is Aries the cowherd.’</p>
<p>‘Whether cometh this of thee or of thy son?’ said the king.</p>
<p>‘Nay, sir’ said Aries, ‘this desire cometh of my son and not of me,
for I shall tell you I have thirteen sons, and all they will fall to
what labour I put them, and will be right glad to do labour, but this
child will not labour for me, for anything that my wife or I may do, but
always he will be shooting or casting darts, and glad for to see battles
and to behold knights, and always day and night he desireth of me to be
made a knight.’</p>
<p>‘What is thy name?’ said the king unto the young man.</p>
<p>‘Sir, my name is Tor.’</p>
<p>The king beheld him fast, and saw he was passingly well-visaged and
passingly well made of his years. ‘Well,’ said King Arthur unto Aries
the cowherd, ‘fetch all thy sons afore me that I may see them.’</p>
<p>And so the poor man did, and all were shapen much like the poor man.
But Tor was not like none of them all in shape ne in countenance, for he
was much more than any of them.</p>
<p>‘Now,’ said King Arthur unto the cowherd, ‘where is the sword he
shall be made knight withal?’</p>
<p>‘It is here,’ said Tor.</p>
<p>‘Take it out of the sheath,’ said the king, ‘and require me to make
you a knight.’</p>
<p>Then Tor alit off his mare and pulled out his sword, kneeling, and
requiring the king that he would make him knight, and that he might be a
knight of the Table Round.</p>
<p>‘As for a knight I will make you,’ and therewith smote him in the
neck with the sword, saying, ‘Be ye a good knight, and so I pray to God
so ye may be, and if ye be of prowess and of worthiness ye shall be a
knight of the Table Round. Now Merlin,’ said Arthur, ‘say whether this
Tor shall be a good knight or no.’</p>
<p>‘Yea, sir, he ought to be a good knight, for he is comen of as good a
man as any is alive, and of king’s blood.’</p>
<p>‘How so, sir?’ said the king.</p>
<p>‘I shall tell you,’ said Merlin. ‘This poor man, Aries the cowherd,
is not his father, he is nothing sib to him, for King Pellinor is his
father.’</p>
<p>‘I suppose nay,’ said the cowherd.</p>
<p>‘Fetch thy wife afore me,’ said Merlin, ‘and she shall not say
nay.’</p>
<p>Anon the wife was fetched, which was a fair housewife, and there she
answered Merlin full womanly, and there she told the king and Merlin
that when she was a maid, and went to milk kine, there met with her a
stern knight, ‘and half by force he had my maidenhead, and at that time
he begat my son Tor, and he took away from me my greyhound that I had
that time with me, and said that he would keep the greyhound for my
love.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said the cowherd, ‘I weened not this, but I may believe it
well, for he had never no tatches of me.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Tor unto Merlin, ‘dishonour not my mother.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Merlin, ‘it is more for your worship than hurt, for your
father is a good man and a king, and he may right well advance you and
your mother, for ye were begotten or ever she was wedded.’</p>
<p>‘That is truth,’ said the wife.</p>
<p>‘It is the less grief unto me,’ said the cowherd.</p>
<p>sib: related.</p>
