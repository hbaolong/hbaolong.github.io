<h4 id="chapter-33">Chapter 33</h4>
<p>How Sir Gawain and Sir Gareth fought each against other, and how they
knew each other by the damosel Lynet</p>
<p>So the duke departed, and Sir Gareth stood there alone; and there he
saw an armed knight coming toward him. Then Sir Gareth took the duke’s
shield, and mounted upon horseback, and so without bidding they ran
together as it had been the thunder. And there that knight hurt Sir
Gareth under the side with his spear. And then they alit and drew their
swords, and gave great strokes that the bood trailed to the ground. And
so they fought two hours.</p>
<p>At last there came the damosel Lynet, that some men call the Damosel
Savage, and she came riding upon an ambling mule; and there she cried
all on high, ‘Sir Gawain, Sir Gawain, leave thy fighting with thy
brother Sir Gareth.’</p>
<p>And when he heard her say so he threw away his shield and his sword,
and ran to Sir Gareth, and took him in his arms, and sithen kneeled down
and asked him mercy.</p>
<p>‘What are ye,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘that right now were so strong and so
mighty, and now so suddenly yield you to me?’</p>
<p>‘O Gareth, I am your brother Sir Gawain, that for your sake have had
great sorrow and labour.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Gareth unlaced his helm, and kneeled down to him, and asked
him mercy. Then they rose both, and embraced either other in their arms,
and wept a great while or they might speak, and either of them gave
other the prize of the battle. And there were many kind words between
them.</p>
<p>‘Alas, my fair brother,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘perdy I owe of right to
worship you and ye were not my brother, for ye have worshipped King
Arthur and all his court, for ye have sent me more worshipful knights
this twelvemonth than six the best of the Round Table have done, except
Sir Launcelot.’</p>
<p>Then came the Damosel Savage that was the Lady Lynet, that rode with
Sir Gareth so long and there she did staunch Sir Gareth’s wounds and Sir
Gawain’s.</p>
<p>‘Now what will ye do?’ said the Damosel Savage, ‘Meseemeth that it
were well done that Arthur had witting of you both, for your horses are
so bruised that they may not bear.’</p>
<p>‘Now, fair damosel,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘I pray you ride unto my lord
mine uncle, King Arthur, and tell him what adventure is to me betid
here, and I suppose he will not tarry long.’</p>
<p>Then she took her mule and lightly she came to King Arthur that was
but two mile thence. And when she had told him tidings the king bad get
him a palfrey. And when he was upon his back he bad the lords and ladies
come after, who that would; and there was saddling and bridling of
queens’ horses and princes’ horses, and well was him that soonest might
be ready.</p>
<p>So when the king came thereas they were, he saw Sir Gawain and Sir
Gareth sit upon a little hill-side, and then the king avoided his horse.
And when he came night Sir Gareth he would have spoken but he might not;
and therewith he sank down in a swoon for gladness. And so they start
unto their uncle, and required him of his good grace to be of good
comfort. Wit ye well the king made great joy, and many a piteous
complaint he made to Sir Gareth, and ever he wept as he had been a
child.</p>
<p>With that came his mother, the Queen of Orkney, Dame Margawse, and
when she saw Sir Gareth readily in the visage she might not weep, but
suddenly fell down in a swoon, and lay there a great while like as she
had been dead. And then Sir Gareth recomforted his mother in such wise
that she recovered and made good cheer.</p>
<p>Then the king commanded that all manner of knights that were under
his obeissance should make their lodging right there for the love of his
nephews. And so it was done, and all manner of purveyance purveyed, that
there lacked nothing that might be gotten of tame nor wild for gold or
silver. And then by the means of the Damosel Savage Sir Gawain and Sir
Gareth were healed of their wounds; and there they sojourned eight
days.</p>
<p>Then said King Arthur unto the Damosel Savage, ‘I marvel that your
sister, Dame Lyonesse, cometh not here to me, and in especial that she
cometh not to visit her knight, my nephew Sir Gareth, that hath had so
much travail for her love.’</p>
<p>‘My lord,’ said the damosel Lynet, ‘ye must of your good grace hold
her excused, for she knoweth not that my lord, Sir Gareth, is here.’</p>
<p>‘Go then for her,’ said King Arthur, ‘that we may be appointed what
is best to done, according to the pleasure of my nephew.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the damosel, ‘that shall be done,’ and so she rode unto
her sister.</p>
<p>And, as lightly as she might, made her ready; and she came on the
morn with her brother Sir Gringamore, and with her forty knights. And so
when she was come she had all the cheer that might be done, both of the
king, and of many other kings and queens.</p>
