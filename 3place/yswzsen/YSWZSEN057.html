<h4 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h4>
<p>How Sir Tor found the brachet with a lady, and how a knight assailed
him for the said brachet</p>
<p>Therewith Sir Tor alit and took the dwarf his glaive, and so he came
to the white pavilion, and saw three damosels lie in it, on1 one pallet
sleeping, and so he went to the other pavilion, and found a lady lying
sleeping therein, but there was the white brachet that bayed at her
fast, and therewith the lady yede out of the pavilion and all her
damosels. But anon as Sir Tor espied the white brachet, he took her by
force and took her to the dwarf.</p>
<p>‘What, will ye so,’ said the lady, ‘take my brachet from me?’</p>
<p>‘Yea,’ said Sir Tor, ‘this brachet have I sought from King Arthur’s
court hither.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said the lady, ‘knight, ye shall not go far with her, but
that ye shall be met and grieved.’</p>
<p>‘I shall abide what adventure that cometh by the grace of God,’ and
so mounted upon his horse, and passed on his way toward Camelot; but it
was so near night he might not pass but little further.</p>
<p>‘Know ye any lodging?’ said Tor.</p>
<p>‘I know none,’ said the dwarf, ‘but here besides is an hermitage, and
there ye must take lodging as ye find.’</p>
<p>And within a while they came to the hermitage and took lodging; and
was there grass, oats and bread for their horses; soon it was sped, and
full hard was their supper; but there they rested them all night till on
the morn, and heard a mass devoutly, and took their leave of the hermit,
and Sir Tor prayed the hermit to pray for him. He said he would, and
betook him to God, and so mounted upon horseback and rode towards
Camelot a long while.</p>
<p>With that they heard a knight call loud that came after them, and he
said, ‘Knight, abide, and yield my brachet that thou took from my
lady.’</p>
<p>Sir Tor returned again, and beheld him how he was a seemly knight and
well horsed, and well armed at all points; then Sir Tor dressed his
shield, and took his spear in his hands, and the other came fiercely
upon him, and smote both horse and man to the earth. Anon they arose
lightly and drew their swords as eagerly as lions, and put their shields
afore them, and smote through the shields, that the cantels fell off
both parties. Also they tamed their helms that the hot blood ran out,
and the thick mails of their hauberks they carved and rove in sunder
that the hot blood ran to the earth, and both they had many wounds and
were passing weary.</p>
<p>But Sir Tor espied that the other knight fainted, and then he sued
fast upon him, and doubled his strokes, and gart him go to the earth on
the one side. Then Sir Tor bad him yield him.</p>
<p>‘That will I not,’ said Abelleus, ‘while my life lasteth and the soul
is within my body, unless that thou wilt give me the brachet.’</p>
<p>‘That will I not do,’ said Sir Tor, ‘for it was my quest to bring
again thy brachet, thee, or both.’</p>
<p>enewed: coloured. brachet: bitch-hound. sped: finished.</p>
