<p>We cannot be certain of the identity of the author of Le Morte
D’Arthur and several theories have been advanced as to his historical
circumstances. However, the theory put forward by an American scholar,
G. L. Kittredge, has prevailed. He claimed that the author was a Sir
Thomas Malory or Maleore of Newbold Revell in Warwickshire, born in the
first quarter of the fifteenth century, who spent the greater part of
the last twenty years of his life in prison. Contemporary accounts
accuse him of a number of crimes, including attempted murder, rape and
armed robbery and he is also credited with a couple of dramatic escapes
from prison. Other records suggest that he was a fighting man rather
than a criminal. He was certainly in the service of Richard Beauchamp,
Earl of Warwick, and fought with him in the siege of Calais in 1436. It
is not surprising that some scholars have found it difficult to
reconcile this violent man with the author of these moral tales.</p>
<p>Another possible candidate is a Thomas Malory of Studley and Hutton
in Yorkshire and it has been suggested that the language of the tales
points to an author living north of Warwickshire.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that the author was a member of the gentry
and a Lancastrian who deeply mourned the passing of the age of chivalry.
He describes himself as a ‘knight-prisoner’ and it is clear that he
spent many years in prison and Le Morte D’Arthur was probably written
while the author was incarcerated. It would seem that he had seen
service in southwestern France and it is possible that some of this book
was written while he was held captive by Jacques d’Armagnac, who had an
extensive Arthurian library. He is thought to have died around 1471.</p>
<p>John Lawlor was Professor of English Language and Literature at the
University of Keele, and has held visiting appointments at the Folger
Shakespeare Library, Brandeis University and the universities of
California, British Columbia and New Mexico. He is the author of The
Tragic Sense in Shakespeare. Piers Plowman: An Essay in Criticism and
Chaucer.</p>
<p>Janet Cowen was formerly Senior Lecturer in English at King’s
College, University of London.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Fact and fiction, romantic impossibility and historical likelihood,
are intertwined at many stages of Arthurian story. There is, to begin
with, the richness and enigmatic quality of all things connected with
Arthur – a beguilingly beautiful labyrinth (Arturi regis ambages
pulcerrime) for Dante at the end of the thirteenth century, and a
continuing attraction in the seventeenth for Milton, who thought he
might find a theme fit for epic in a tale of Arthur ‘moving wars beneath
the earth’. That is one side, and a lasting side, of Arthurian story. In
such reincarnations, we have Rex quondam Rexque futurus, the King who
once was and who will be again: given the archetype, the appropriate
magic follows. Who would have thought that a hero of this order might in
fact be traced in history? Yet there is ground for believing in the
existence of a victorious commander, a Briton of the later fifth
century, leading a series of successful encounters with invaders (and,
possibly, traitorous Britons)1 – a glorious career which later
generations thought of as ended not by external defeat but by dissension
within the war-band. This is the Arthur who is first reflected in the
pages of Geoffrey of Monmouth (1136): and it is this Arthur who
continued to appeal to medieval English writers – a leader whose
triumphant course ends in the lamentable division of his kingdom; he
passes from men’s sight as one whose glory is not overthrown but
temporarily eclipsed. French writers, on the other hand, appear from the
outset to be chiefly interested in one outstanding member of Arthur’s
company. Sir Lancelot; and in handling this theme they seize from the
beginning on the tragic possibilities that lie in wait for chivalry when
it is drawn aside from the only true quest, ‘the seeking out of the high
secrets and hidden things of Our Lord’. The Grail is the goal of man’s
highest endeavour; and by this standard Sir Lancelot, best of earthly
knights, falls short. An English author who has before him both English
and French tellings of Arthurian story is dealing with potentially
irreconcilable material; and this point is central to all assessment of
Malory’s Morte. Since French sources bulk large in his work, Malory has
been subject to what his best exponent has, with characteristic modesty,
called ‘almost a necessary evil’, an English author edited by a French
scholar;1 and all learned debate must run the risk of strong, if latent,
preconception in favour of an ‘original’ which Malory may be thought of
as ‘translating’. In this light he is always in danger of being judged,
for good or ill, in terms of his faithfulness as an intermediary; his
individuality as a writer is liable to be underrated or all but
ignored.</p>
<p>Malory’s individual being as a man, his historical identity, has
provided a paradox, too. Since the 1890s, beginning with the skilful
advocacy of the American scholar Kittredge, it has been generally
accepted that the author was a certain Sir Thomas Malory or Maleore
(with variant spellings) who lived at Newbold Revell in Warwickshire,
soldiered at Calais in his youth under the great Richard Beauchamp, Earl
of Warwick, and came to see in the decline of the Lancastrian fortunes a
parallel with the overthrow of King Arthur’s rule. He even gives
Mordred, the insurgent in his story, a Yorkist-like army, drawn from
south-eastern England. All very pleasing and probable, no doubt: but
this Sir Thomas turns out, on later inquiry, to have been a prisoner,
and his offences include armed assault and rape. Apologists have
reminded us of the turbulent times in which he lived; but the rape with
which Malory was charged cannot be explained away as a technicality in
the forcible eviction of a tenant. Two offences were alleged, and the
charge reads unambiguously cum ea carnaliter concubuit. This rather
unpromising figure, then, appears to be the author of ‘the noble and
joyous historye of the grete conquerour and excellent kyng, Kyng
Arthur’; and, to crown all, there came to light (at Winchester in 1934)
a manuscript which showed clearly how the writer had set about his task.
The work is divided into clearly-defined sections; a series of prayers
for ‘help’ or ‘deliverance’, occurring throughout the book, amplify the
single prayer that Caxton had printed at the end, and one of them makes
it plain that the petitioner is ‘a knyght presoner’; and one section
(that on the Roman war, Caxton’s Book V) is notably longer in the
manuscript than in the printed text. By this single discovery we are
given new information about the author; about the mode of composition;
and, by implication, about the first editor, William Caxton, who
published his edition in 1485.</p>
<p>This, of course, in turn raised other problems, and the effect was to
suspend Malorian studies until a full text of the Winchester Manuscript
was available. It appeared in 1947, as The Works of Sir Thomas Malory,
edited by Eugène Vinaver, with a revised edition, based on a fresh
collection and incorporating new matter in the Commentary, appearing in
1967. With the text of Winchester before them, scholars have begun to
engage in lively discussion. In the field of interpretation, one matter
has been strikingly dominant, the question of unity. Could Malory be
said to have written a ‘hoole book’ or instead eight separate romances
(hence the significance of Vinaver’s title, The Works of Sir Thomas
Malory)? As to the author himself, William Matthews has recently come
forward with a vigorous claim for a Yorkshire Knight in place of
Kittredge’s ‘ill-framed’ candidate.1 The debate, on these counts as on
others, continues; and the general liveliness of interest in Arthurian
matter can be seen from evidence as widely different as the musical
Camelot, based on T. H. White’s serio-comic re-shaping of Malory, The
Once and Future King, and excavation, begun in 1966 and still
continuing, at South Cadbury ‘Castle’, which appears to have been the
base of a British ruler of some substance, whether Arthur or another.
‘Camelot’, according to John Leland, was a local name for it in the
sixteenth century: and the name is perpetuated in the Camelot Research
Committee which has charge of the work. As their President stirringly
puts it, we may yet live to see ‘another convergence of fact and
tradition’ similar to that which brought Troy and Mycenae out of legend
into fact.1 Leaving aside all further question of historical identity,
Malory’s no less than Arthur’s, what shall we say of Malory’s
contribution to the legend, his labour to tell ‘of Kyng Arthur and of
his noble knyghts of the Rounde Table’?</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Arthur, the monarch of a kingdom that falls by treachery, makes his
first appearance in Geoffrey of Monmouth’s History of the Kings of
Britain, written in 1136. There he is at the height of success, ready to
march into Italy having defeated the Roman army, when he hears of
Mordred’s treachery in seizing the throne and marrying the Queen. Arthur
returns to Britain and is at first victorious against the rebels; but in
the last battle (beside the river Camel, ‘in Cornwall’) though Mordred
falls, Arthur himself is fatally wounded and, appointing a successor to
the crown, he is taken to ‘the island of Avallon for the healing of his
wounds’. When this matter is first handled in French, all interest is
focused not upon Arthur but upon Sir Lancelot. Le Roman de Lancelot du
Lac (1225–30) consists of Lancelot, an account of the Quest for the Holy
Grail, and the death of King Arthur; and this was later enlarged by the
Estoire del Graal and the Estoire de Merlin. The focus, from the
beginning, is firmly upon Lancelot; and his failure to achieve the Grail
gives the measure of earthly chivalry. The son, Galahad, succeeds where
Lancelot falls short. More important, from our present point of view, is
the function of the Mort Artu, the section dealing with Arthur’s defeat
and death. It is there ‘to describe Lancelot’s final failure – that
which occurred when he was called upon to save Arthur and his kingdom’.1
The French Arthurian cycle establishes clearly the gap between earthly
and spiritual. By this standard knights who have shown little secular
prowess – Galahad, Bors, Perceval – shine forth: and Lancelot and Arthur
are inevitably headed for disaster. The distinction is well summed up in
terms first used by E. K. Chambers.2 Corbenic (the castle where the
Grail is achieved) predominates over Camelot (the region par excellence
of the chivalric life). Readers who come to Arthurian story with this
tradition (derived perhaps from Tennyson or from Wagner, rather than
medieval writers) colouring their thoughts will find it difficult to
know what Malory is about, and may find him unduly prosaic, insensitive
to what they take to be the true import of his material. We must,
however, remind ourselves that there is no one version of Arthurian
material towards which all others must aspire.</p>
<p>In contrast with the French the earliest English versions of the
story, Layamon’s Brut (written in the closing years of the twelfth
century) and the alliterative Morte Arthur (about 1360) tell the story
simply, in terms of the chronicle tradition. Here, as in Geoffrey of
Monmouth, the centre of attention is Arthur, and the story is of stark
disaster overtaking his kingdom once loyalty is breached. There is only
one instance before Malory of an English writer working from a French
source (the stanzaic Le Morte Arthur, dating from the late fourteenth
century); and it is very noticeable that this writer disregards the link
between the Grail and the Lancelot themes. He leaves his readers to
confront the dire events of which Lancelot, Arthur and Guinevere are the
victims. Like Lancelot’s seven companions, now turned hermit, we must
resign ourselves to things which pass our understanding:</p>
<p>Off lancelot du lake telle I no more,</p>
<p>But thus by-leve these ermytes sevyn;</p>
<p>And yit is Arthur beryed thore,</p>
<p>And quene Gaynour, as I yow nevyn;</p>
<p>With monkes that ar Ryght of lore.</p>
<p>They Rede and synge with mylde stevyn:</p>
<p>’Ihesu, that suffred woundes sore,</p>
<p>Graunt us All the blysse of hevyn!’</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>Explycit le morte Arthur</p>
<p>Here is something which, it may be argued, has qualities equal and
opposite to those of the French romances. Where they provide explanation
and continuity, the English writer presents unmitigated reality, what
indubitably happened in all its sharpness. If he refers to Fortune’s
wheel – that convincing instrument of destiny – it is in terms that only
underline cruel inevitability. The wheel turns in Arthur’s nightmare
before the last battle, and he falls into darkness (a ‘blake water’), to
be rent limb from limb by monsters. Here, then, is a version which,
notwithstanding French sources, is graphically simple, leaving the
audience free to make what they can of the connexions between what men
are and the things that befall them. Malory, in his turn, must be
allowed the same freedom; and if he does not link the Death of Arthur
with the quest for the Grail and if he does not expatiate on the meaning
of Fortune’s wheel, he may, so far from misunderstanding the superiority
of Corbenic over Camelot, have contrived it that Corbenic becomes ‘a
province of Camelot’.1 In that event, the chivalric life will not be
explained from without, as a thing inferior to the spiritual order: it
is to be ‘reinterpreted’, as Vinaver acutely notes, ‘from within’.2 The
changes Malory makes can be treated under several heads – structure and
incidental detail; the matter of love; and style, the choice and
ordering of language. In all of these aspects we are, concerned with an
English writer pursuing his own course and, in the absence of any clear
model, learning in the doing.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>The essential structural difference between the French Arthurian
prose cycle and Malory’s work may be expressed as the difference between
complex interweaving and a more sequential treatment.3 In the French, no
one section of the work exists in isolation from the next; ideally,
‘each episode or group of episodes was to be either a continuation of
what occurred earlier on, or an anticipation of what was yet to come, or
both.’4 An analogy from visual art may help. The French mode of
narration may be thought of as a process of intertwining, the themes of
the complex story being ‘entwined, latticed, knotted or plaited’ so that
they resemble ‘the themes in Romanesque ornament, caught in a constant
movement of endless complexity’.5 Malory’s first and essential response
to that complexity is to cut clear swaths, to establish lines of
demarcation between major sections of the story. Whatever impact his
work is to have will be sequential and cumulative; and since his eye is
firmly upon the Morte, the unrelieved disaster (Morte Arthur Saunz
Guerdon) of the death of Arthur and the passing of the goodly fellowship
of the Round Table, the pattern of significance will have to become
increasingly apparent in a rising tide of events and their inevitable
train of consequence, not be immovably evident in any overriding system,
however exalted. Certainly, the ‘Tale of the Sankgreal’ will have an
honoured place, as ‘a tale chronicled for one of the truest and one of
the holiest that is in this world’. But that is all Malory’s design
allows. We must return to the plane of the earthly chivalry, and to the
disaster that impends when Lancelot, the King’s most redoubtable
champion, is seen to be a man of fatally divided loyalties – first, as
lover of Guinevere, then as the unwitting slayer of Gareth, brother of
Lancelot’s most faithful friend, Gawain. There is no need to credit
Malory with great artistry. Faced with what might have seemed the
threatening complexity of his French sources he very possibly reacted
with healthy mistrust. But, equally, there is no question that as events
draw near to the fated end he writes with greatest authority. He
deserves the praise of having kept his eye on the object; of having at
the very least felt his way through to the things that made coherent
sense, and constituted a manifest warning, for him and for all
Englishmen.</p>
<p>Malory began with a tale of King Arthur and the Roman Emperor Lucius,
where Arthur stands forth as a veritable military hero – one who, in the
language of the Winchester colophon, ‘was Emperoure hymself thorow
dygnyté of his hondys’. This, shortened, constitutes Caxton’s Book V.
Malory then went on to draw from the Suite du Merlin more material which
gave background to this figure – his beginnings and some notable earlier
exploits. This made up his ‘Tale of King Arthur’, which forms Caxton’s
Books I to IV. It is thought that there was an interval of time before
he resumed his work with ‘The Noble Tale of Sir Launcelot’ and the ‘Tale
of Sir Gareth’ (Caxton VI and VII). There next lay in his path the
formidable matter of the Tristram story and of the Grail, and here his
powers were above all tested, before the culminating power and
irresistible sequence of the last two sections of his work, the ‘Book of
Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere’ and the conclusion of the whole in
‘The most piteous tale of the Morte Arthur saunz guerdon’. Structurally,
Malory’s work gains pace and authority as it advances: virisque adquirit
eundo. The design draws to a head; ambiguities and lesser things – among
them, in this telling, the Grail quest itself – fall into place as total
and irreversible loss threatens. In the end we are left with a kingdom
and the values it epitomized breached from within:</p>
<p>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;</p>
<p>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.</p>
<p>This difference in structure is paralleled in a characteristic
difference of tone, evident in the incidental detail of Malory’s work as
against the French. Most notably, the marvels cease to multiply: Malory
prunes them, sometimes omitting, sometimes telescoping. He is less
interested in a world where magic is evident in a dozen particulars than
in the one detail that transforms the world we know. Here again it would
be inept to press for conscious art over natural bent. All we can say is
that Malory’s preference is for singleness and simplicity over variety
and multiplicity. The same is true of his preference for realistic,
often homely, detail. For example, in the story of Tristram, he alters
his source, in which Tristan’s first falling in love arose from a desire
to oust palomides from Iseult’s favours: now love is an unprompted
growth. On the other hand, at the parting of the lovers, not even
mentioned in the French, Malory adds detail: there is an effusion of
grief (‘comédie larmoyante’, as Vinaver once severely called it) and the
exchange of pledges. This has less the air of conscious realism than of
an entire naturalness – an unstudied concern to handle matters that are
within the narrator’s range and, where opportunity offers, to establish
their credibility in human terms. Such a narrator comes into his own
when the matter lies within his own field of experience. The Grail quest
in Malory has the air of a real expedition. The French writers may
choose to have their eyes on higher things: but Malory’s field
expedition has to be financed. Malory’s Guinevere sends to Bors, Hector
and Lionel ‘tresour ynough for theyr expencys’: and when Guinevere’s
steadfastness in seeking the mad Lancelot is to be brought home to him,
Sir Ector’s words carry the stamp of truth: ‘Hyt hath coste my lady the
quene twenty thousand pounds the sekynge of you.’</p>
<p>If we call this quality prosaic, we must mean a habit of
concentration on what is within the narrator’s range, what he can, in
this sense, be understood to vouch for. Arthur the King, the earthly
chivalry in its accomplishments – what Spenser called ‘derring doe’ –
this is the centre of his attention. When that world is to be destroyed
he himself is the first to grieve; and then only Malory can find
appropriate words for this Arthur:</p>
<p>Wyte you well, my harte was never so hevy as hit ys now. And much
more I am soryar for my good knyghtes losse than for the losse of my
fayre quene; for quenys I myght have inow, but such a felyship of good
knyghtes shall never be togydirs in no company.1</p>
<p>These are the priorities in Malory’s handling of his material. The
matter of love has therefore a subordinate interest; and on two
occasions this is strikingly apparent. They deserve to be set out in
full, as instances of Malory’s own invention, without parallel in his
sources, and as such directly expressive of his own characteristic
temper.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>The first occurs early in Malory’s career as a writer, if the account
earlier given is correct. It is in ‘The Noble Tale of Sir Launcelot du
Lake’, where Lancelot is about to take leave of a ‘damesell’ whom he has
saved from ‘dystresse’. Praising him as excelling all other knights for
courtesy and ‘meekness’, the lady goes on:</p>
<p>‘But one thyng, sir knyght, methynkes ye lak, ye that ara knyght
wyveles, that ye woll nat love som mayden other jantylwoman. For I cowde
never here sey that ever ye loved ony of no maner of degré, and that is
grete pyté. But hit is noysed that ye love quene Gwenyvere, and that she
hath ordeyned by enchauntemente that ye shall never love none other but
hir, nother none other damesell ne lady shall rejoyce you; where
〔fore〕 there be many in this londe, of hyghe astate and lowe, that
make grete sorow.’</p>
<p>‘Fayre damesell,’ seyde sir Launcelot, ‘I may nat warne peple to
speke of me what hit pleasyth hem. But for to be a weddyd man, I thynke
hit nat, for than I muste couche with hir and leve armys and
turnamentis, batellys and adventures. And as for to sey to take my
pleasaunce with peramours, that woll I refuse: in prencipall for drede
of God, for knyghtes that bene adventures sholde nat be adventures
nothir lecherous, for than they be nat happy nother fortunate unto the
werrys; for other they shall be overcom with a sympler knyght than they
be hemself, other ellys they shall sle by unhappe and hir cursednesse
bettir men than they be hemself. And so who that usyth peramours shall
be unhappy, and all thynge unhappy that is aboute them.’</p>
<p>And so sir Launcelot and she departed.</p>
<p>(Works, pp. 270–71; Caxton VI 10)</p>
<p>Here Sir Lancelot, the arch-exemplar of those who love peramours, is
made to disclaim both marriage and adultery. What can this mean? We must
turn to the context in which this Lancelot comes forward; and it is at
once apparent that we are not dealing with the Lancelot of French
romance. Malory has turned from Arthur, the pre-eminent figure, whose
deeds are chronicled in the Roman War (Caxton, Book V) to deal with the
one who stands next in chivalrous prowess – a Sir Lancelot who ‘encresed
so mervaylously in worship and honoure’ that ‘therefore he is the fyrste
knyght that the Frey〔n〕sh booke makyth me〔n〕cion of aftir kynge
Arthure com frome Rome.’ There is Lancelot’s significance defined; and
it has an appropriate consequence:</p>
<p>Wherefore quene Gwenyvere had hym in grete favoure aboven all other
knyghtis, and so he loved the quene agayne aboven all other ladyes dayes
of his lyff, and for hir he dud many dedys of armys and saved her from
the fyre thorow his noble chevalry.</p>
<p>Guinevere honours Arthur’s most proficient knight and he in response
(‘agayne’) reveres her above all others, throughout his life (‘dayes of
his lyff’). Malory concludes the sentence with a glimpse of what those
‘dayes of his lyff’ will include – many feats of arms on her behalf and
a rescue from the stake; but in the close we are firmly reminded of the
source from which all springs, Lancelot’s ‘noble chevalry’. It cannot be
maintained that the purpose of this Book is to show Lancelot setting out
‘to prove himself … in order to win the approval of Guinevere, whom he
already loves’.1 Lancelot in fact, in the passage already quoted and in
two others, is made to deny the rumour that he and Guinevere are lovers.
Malory’s mood in the present passage is proleptic: he brings into play
his knowledge of where things will end. But the Lancelot who occupies
the stage is Lancelot in his original brightness, ‘the fyrste knyght …
aftir kynge Arthure com frome Rome’. The criterion of excellence is one
and the same for liege-lord and follower – ‘armys and worshyp’,
‘prouesse and noble dedys’, ‘noble chevalry’.</p>
<p>Lancelot’s response to the lady’s questioning therefore places ‘armys
and turnamentis, batellys and adventures’ in the forefront of proper
endeavour. Marriage, in this light, is a renunciation. Do we have here,
undeveloped as it is, a hint of the idiosyncratic and temperamental
difference between Arthur and Lancelot? Lancelot stubbornly clings to
his single state, as though it were the only one proper to ‘adventurous’
knighthood. Yet in King Arthur we do not have an inactive hero, married
though he is.1 At all events, it is not marriage but loving paramours
that is condemned; and Lancelot’s language is firm, modulating from
solemnity (‘in prencipall for drede of God’) to simple certainty. The
key to Malory’s handling of the passage is in words that the modern
reader may easily misread – ‘happy’, ‘unhappe’, and the repeated
‘unhappy’ which seals the conclusion. We must think of this in much
stronger terms than the ordinary sense of ‘happy’ or ‘unhappy’ allows
today. ‘Mishap’ is a step towards it, if we go beyond the sense of a
minor slip to the gravity of ill-fortune, things going grievously and
unalterably wrong. For example, Arthur, at the final parting of the
ways, turns away from the traitor with the single exclamation, ‘Alas,
this unhappy day!’ Even more strikingly, cause and effect are brought
together in the one word when, after battle is joined, Arthur catches
sight of Mordred:</p>
<p>‘Now, gyff me my speare,’ seyde kynge Arthure unto sir Lucan, ‘for
yondir I have aspyed the traytoure that all thys woo hath wrought.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, latte hym be’, seyde sir Lucan, ‘for he ys unhappy. And yf ye
passe this unhappy day y〔e〕 shall be ryght well revenged.’</p>
<p>It is this long prospect of ‘unhappiness’ which momentarily darkens
the scene when Lancelot assures the lady ‘who that usyth peramours shall
be unhappy, and all thynge unhappy that is aboute them.’ Lancelot is not
yet the lover of Guinevere peramours; but what he asserts as established
doctrine – a consequence which, since it cannot be set aside, has the
force of destiny – will one day become a matter of disastrous
experience. Lancelot speaks more than he knows; Malory invests his words
with tragic irony.</p>
<p>The second major instance of Malory dealing with the matter of love
occurs in the penultimate section of the whole work, ‘The Book of Sir
Lancelot and Queen Guinevere’. Caxton places this section at the very
end of Book XVIII (Chapter 25): but in any ordering, it is clearly
designed to serve as prologue to what immediately follows – the events
of ‘the moneth of May’ when Guinevere rides forth with ‘ten knyghtes of
the Table Rounde … on-maynge into woodis and fyldis besydes
Westemynster’. This time Malory speaks in his own person. He begins with
the praise of ‘the moneth of May … whan every lusty harte begynnyth to
blossom and to burgyne’. This, above all, is the time when ‘lovers
callyth to their mynde olde jantylnes and old servyse’. Things are
gathering to a head in his story; but the new stage is rooted deep in
the past. This prompts the next reflection. The seasons pass: ‘grene
summer’ is followed in the natural order by ‘wynter rasure’ which ‘do
the all way arace and deface grene summer’; and this, Malory affirms, is
the pattern of ‘unstable love in man and woman’ –</p>
<p>for in many persones there ys no stabylité; for 〔w〕e may se all
day, for a lytyll blaste of wyntres rasure, anone we shall deface and
lay aparte trew love, for lytyll or nowght, that coste muche thynge.
Thys ys no wysedome nother no stabylité, but hit ys fyeblenes of nature
and grete disworshyp, whosomever usyth thys.</p>
<p>Here, again, modern usage may mislead. We must be on our guard
against writing down ‘stabylité’ as a commonplace virtue. Much more, it
is the highly prized characteristic of steadfastness, continuance in
well-doing. ‘stability’ in this sense is the great virtue of constancy.
Its larger implications are evident enough for Malory. When ‘the
felyshyp of the Rounde Table ys brokyn’ the foundation of order is gone;
there will be, the Knights perceive, ‘ever debate and stryff’ in place
of ‘quyet and reste’. Lancelot is credited by them with ‘a grete parte’
in the achievement of order; and, in reply, Lancelot gives it its proper
name: ‘I wote well that in me was nat all the stabilité of thys realme,
but in that I myght I ded my dever’ (Caxton XX 17–18).</p>
<p>‘Stability’, then, is the great virtue, to be lamented in its
passing. But in the present passage, Malory has a surprise in store.
First, as on the earlier occasion, we must be told what true virtue
consists in; ‘vertuouse love’ is therefore defined:</p>
<p>lyke as May moneth flowryth and floryshyth in every mannes gardyne,
so in lyke wyse lat every man of worshyp florysh hys herte in thys
worlde: firste unto God, and nexte unto the joy of them that he promysed
hys feythe unto; for there was never worshypfull man norworshypfull
woman but they loved one bettir than another; and worshyp in armys may
never be foyled. But firste reserve the honoure to God, and secundely
thy quarell muste com of thy lady. And such love I calle vertuouse
love.</p>
<p>It is very different, Malory goes on, from experience of love
‘nowadayes’, when love is ‘sone hote sone colde. Thys ys no stabylyté’
–</p>
<p>But the olde love was nat so. For men and women coude love togydirs
seven yerys, and no lycoures lustis was betwyxte them, and than was love
trouthe and faythefulnes. And so in lyke wyse was used such love in
kynge Arthurs dayes.</p>
<p>So be it. Inconstancy appears as a national failing – ‘a greate
defaughte of us Englysshemen, for ther may no thynge us please no terme’
(Caxton XXI 1). Malory’s readers must therefore be willing to receive
upon report what they cannot, in their latter age, experience for
themselves. Where Malory had glanced forward in the earlier episode,
from Lancelot’s innocence to his later sufferings, here he makes his
reader look back, to old times and the ‘old love’. But here, as there,
he comes to rest in the admirable qualities of his characters.
Lancelot’s ‘noble chevalry’, from which all was to spring, is now echoed
in praise for Guinevere. Modern lovers will do well to recall the
past:</p>
<p>And therefore all ye that be lovers, calle unto youre remembraunce
the monethe of May, lyke as ded quene Gwenyver, for whom I make here a
lytyll mencion, that whyle she lyved she was a trew lover, and therefor
she had a good ende.</p>
<p>Guinevere is commended as a ‘trew’ lover, and ‘truth’ of course means
‘stabylyté’, constancy. Once again, in the ‘bad’ instance Malory dwells
upon the redeeming feature. But it marks an advance in skill that this
time the author pays tribute in his own person, making ‘a lytyll
mencion’ that, poised at the end of his prologue, looks forward not only
to the action immediately following (’so hit befelle in the moneth of
May’) but to the longer run of the whole story, the ‘ende’ that already
begins to darken the horizon.</p>
<p>In both instances, Malory has called into play knowledge of events to
come; and since they are dire events, in each instance a bright present
is overshadowed. The effect is, of course, to heighten the sense of
inevitability: momentarily, present and future lie in one focus. But
that is not all. We end each time with the admirable qualities of the
protagonists; and this most powerfully expresses the writer’s sense that
what is to come is a destiny from which no one, least of all the writer
himself, can safeguard the persons of this story. Their lot is thus, in
the ancient phrase, soth ond sārlīc, true and tragic. The shadow that
falls is the shadow of events impending in the real world, not a
foreseeable downfall in terms of a supernaturally-approved system. A
narrative method which is sequential rather than ‘polyphonic’ encourages
the writer to reach backward and forward. Given this method, time
becomes especially the writer’s medium – successive time, as contrasted
with the continuum in which the interwoven method would place all
persons and events, to make one grand design. This is an opportunity
which Malory, moved especially by nostalgia, a reverence for that in the
past which he would see revived in the present, is peculiarly fitted to
take; and in the most successful parts of his work it sustains a sense
of onward and irresistible force. Here we have two leading illustrations
that in Malory’s handling the story ‘had to rely on its own resources
and move by its own momentum’.1</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>What part is played in this by Malory’s style? Vinaver, writing in
1929, when Malory’s achievement seemed to him largely inexplicable in
terms of content, concluded that the Morte Darthur rested securely on
‘the mysterious power of style – the only immortal merit in the world of
books’.2 It is, in fact, a most insecure assumption that Malory has any
one distinctive style. Like a good many fifteenth-century writers, he
writes in one way when he is following his sources, another when he
turns to address his ‘gentle’ readers. There is a further complication:
as the source varies, so, too, does Malory. He can write in the
ordinary, progressive manner of his French prose source; or, equally, in
the strongly alliterative manner of the English poem which underlies the
Roman War (Caxton V); or, again, he will echo the rhythms of the
stanzaic English Morte (as in Caxton XX19). A style?: it is really a
question of styles. To illustrate, there is, firstly, the continuing
manner of French prose:</p>
<p>And than the good man and sir Launcelot went into the chapell; and
the good man toke a stole aboute hys neck and a booke, and than he
conjoined on that booke. And with that they saw the fyende in an hydeous
fygure, that there was no man so hardé-herted in the worlde but he
sholde a bene aferde. Than seyde the fyende,</p>
<p>‘Thou hast travayle me gretly. Now telle me what thou wolte with
me.’</p>
<p>‘I woll,’ seyde the good man, ‘that thou telle me how my felawe becam
dede, and whether he be saved or dampned.’</p>
<p>Than he seyde with an horrible voice,</p>
<p>‘He ys nat lost, but he ys saved!’</p>
<p>‘How may that be?’ seyde the good man. ‘Hit semyth me that he levith
nat well, for he brake hys order for to were a sherte where he ought to
were none, and who that trespassith ayenst oure 〔ordre〕 doth nat
well’</p>
<p>‘Nat so,’ seyde the fyende. ‘Thys man that lyeth here was com of
grete lynage …’</p>
<p>(‘The Quest of the Holy Grail’, Works, pp. 925–6;</p>
<p>of Caxton XV 1)</p>
<p>Lors entre li preudoms en sa chappelle et prent ung livre et met une
estole entour son col, et puis vient hors et commence a conjurer
l’ennemi. Et quant il a grant piece lut, il regarde et voit l’ennemy en
si hideuse fourme qu’il n’a si hardi homme en tout le monde qui grand
hide n’en eust et paour. ‘Tu me travailles trop,’ fait l’ennemi, ‘or me
di que tu me veulz.’ – ‘Je veul,’ fait il, ‘que tu me dies comment cilz
miens compains est mort, et 〔s〕’il est perilz ou sauvez.’ Lors parle
l’ennemi a voix orrible et espoventable et dist; ‘N’est mie perils, mais
sauvés’ – ‘Et comment puet ce estre?’ fait li preudhoms. ‘Il me semble
que tu me mentes, car ce ne me commande mie nostre order, ains le vee
tout plainement que nulx de nostre ordre ne veste chemise de lin; et qui
la vest, il trespasse l’ordre. Et qui en trespassant ordre muert, ce
n’est mie bien, ce m’est avis.’ – ‘A!’ fait l’ennemi, ‘je te diray
comment il est alés de lui. Tu scés bien qu’il fu gentils homs et de
grant lignage …’</p>
<p>(Text from Vinaver, Malory, pp. 159–60)</p>
<p>The structure of each passage is essentially the same; but I have
italicized in the French those words and phrases which Malory does not
render, and it will be seen that his passage gathers force, until with
the final disclosure all is swept aside that does not serve the bleak
contrast of life and death: ’this man that lyetft here was com of grete
lynage’1 Malory’s style, in this type of passage, where he follows a
French original, may certainly be said to make improvements in detail on
his source – by compression and omission, as well as by telling
addition. But in structure it is identical with the source – a prose
which has the characteristic virtues and limitations of oral narration;
clean, progressive, never worse than comfortably pedestrian and often
strikingly laconic.</p>
<p>With other sources, the matter is very different, and then the
effects can be strongly evident to every reader. Arthur’s dream (Caxton
V 4) is itself a kind of half-strangled alliterative poem, where the
clashing phrases make the menace actual and all but overpowering:</p>
<p>As the kynge was in his cog and lay in his caban, he felle in a
slumberyng and dremed how a dredfull dragon dud drenche much of his
peple and com fleyng one wynge oute of the weste partyes. And his hede,
hym semed, was enamyled with asure, and his shuldyrs shone as the golde,
and his wombe was lyke mayles of a merveylous hew, and his tayle was
fulle of tatyrs, and his feete were florysshed as hit were fyne sable.
And his clawys were lyke clene golde, and an hydeouse flame of fyre
there flowe oute of his mowth, lyke as the londe and the watir had
flawmed all on fyre.</p>
<p>There the alliterative rhythms are plain for all to hear. Less
obvious are the phrases which slip in from the stanzaic Morte and blend
with those alliterative turns which are inseparable from a truly native
English speech; as, ‘ware and wyse’, ‘droupe and dare’, with the
occasional stride into full rhythm (‘whyle we thus in holys us hyde’).
Both kinds of alliterative effect are as different as could be from the
quasi-ceremonious language in which Malory directly addresses his
readers. The outstanding example of that is the passage already quoted,
on ‘wynter rasure’ (Caxton XVIII 25). There the fifteenth-century
disease of ‘augmentation’ is sadly evident both in the high-sounding
latinate words (‘constrayne’, ‘dyverce’, ‘neclygence’, ‘rasure’,
‘stabylité’), and in the intendedly elegant clusterings of synonyms (‘to
blossom and to burgyne’, ‘burgenyth and florysshyth’, and the full
measure of ‘spryngith, burgenyth, buddyth, and florysshyth’). It is a
manner that in its quieter manifestations survives in’ Cranmer’s Prayer
book; the pattern ‘arace and deface’, ‘deface and lay aparte’, may
recall ‘acknowledge and confess’, ‘assemble and meet together’, ‘erred
and strayed’. In both secular and religious writings, later readers have
vainly striven to establish significant distinction between terms that
were meant to make their impact not by subtlety of difference but by
cumulative force.</p>
<p>It is easy to ridicule augmentation full-blown. From ‘spryngith,
burgenyth, buddyth, and florysshyth’ it is but a step to the portentous
Lord Berners, assuring his readers that he has ‘volved, turned and read’
those writings which he judged ‘commodious, necessary and profitable’,
to the end that his gentle readers (‘the noble gentlemen of England’)
might ‘see, behold and read the high enterprises, famous acts and
glorious deeds done and achieved by their valiant ancestors’.1 Clearly,
what we are told three times is true. Yet Berners is but one more writer
who, like Malory, feels he must compose ornately for his appearance in
person, but who writes a prose of unostentatious simplicity when he is
following his French source. This disease of ‘augmentation’ in the end
yields a pearl of great price. Hunting for – perhaps we should say,
being haunted by – the more refined equivalent, the English writer can
never be wholly unaware that English is a language in which apparent
synonyms most often convey subtle gradations of mood or attitude rather
than of meaning. The adoptions from French and Latin do not so much oust
the native words as move them imperceptibly down a scale; and whereas
that scale is originally conceived in terms of a hierarchical ‘high’ and
‘low’, it comes in the long run to be an instrument of highly effective
nuance. The end-product is in the seventeenth century, when Browne can
revivify a commonplace by saying that a man may be ‘as content with six
foot as the moles of Adrianus’.2 There, in the contrast of two phrases,
are the mighty and the humble made one in the grave. For a more complex
example, we may hear Jeremy Taylor leading to the assertion that the
triumph of the Christian Faith is miraculous (because otherwise
inexplicable), by characterizing the Apostles as ‘men of mean breeding
and illiberal arts’. It is the exact tone of polite incredulity: and so
the sceptical listener has no inner defence against the final assault of
plain language expressing unalterable fact, in ‘the certainty of them
that saw it, and the courage of them that died for it, and the multitude
of them that believed it’.1</p>
<p>Malory’s attemptedly solemn address to the reader (Caxton XVIII 25)
has its moments of near unbalance: but in the end it, too, comes home to
truth and simplicity. As in the major structuring of his story, so, too,
in this; Malory has his eye on the object. His piece of ‘high sentence’
is not designed to glorify himself, but only to lead to the ‘lytyll
mencion’ of Queen Guinevere: ‘whyle she lyved she was a trew lover, and
therefor she had a good ende.’ Here, as in the quiet omissions and
pruning of incidental detail, and in the treatment of adulterous
passion, Malory succeeds because he holds to one purpose: to tell the
story as it appears to him. He has his own ‘stabylyté’ and the reward is
in the strength of his telling. For once, it is wholly appropriate that
‘style’ least of all reveals the author. C. S. Lewis put the matter with
characteristic verve: ’If you were searching all literature for a man
who might be described as “the opposite of Pater”, Malory would be a
strong candidate.’2</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>There is of course one man whom the ‘augmented’ manner calls vividly
to mind, and that is Caxton, Malory’s first publisher and, as we now
know, his first editor. The discovery of the Winchester Manuscript
brought clearly to light the fact of composition by distinct sections
(as well as a difference in bulk between what Malory had written about
Arthur versus the Emperor Lucius and Caxton’s Book V). Caxton, we now
see, took eight romances and made them into one book, making certain
minor editorial changes (including the omission of all but one of the
explicits, the first of which is the most revealing, for in it the
writer took leave of the reader and left his work for others to
continue), and creating certain confusions, or ‘incongruities’,1 which
arise from the effort to make a single book. In addition, he contributed
a Preface which some readers may have taken too readily as a statement
of Malory’s intent. The question, however, remains whether the unity
Caxton aimed for is largely factitious, or whether he has seized upon
the essential characteristic of Malory’s writings.</p>
<p>The debate has been joined and shows no sign of ending.2 This
clearly, is not the place to attempt to resolve it. But every reader of
Malory’s work may profit by the reminder that the last colophon of all
speaks of two books ending together:</p>
<p>Here is the ende of the hoole book of king Arthur and of his noble
knyghtes of the Rounde Table, that whan they were hole togyders there
was ever an hondred and forty. And here is the ende of The Deth of
Arthur.3</p>
<p>Here, clearly, the writer claims that ‘Two things are finished; this
particular tale, and the whole book of which it is a part.’4 But granted
that, it is another question whether we can press for a close degree of
congruence in all the parts of the ‘hoole book’. What is certain is that
the last two books display a high degree of – can we call it? – cogency;
the sense, at the very least, of complex matter coming to a final
resolution, and, at best (in the closing scenes of all) of an awful
finality as inevitable destruction sets in – ‘a grete angur and
unhapp〔e〕 that stynted nat tylle the floure of chyvalry of 〔alle〕
the worlde was destroyed and slayne’. Caxton, it appears, did not feel
the almost gravitational pull of the Morte itself, the death of Arthur
and the overthrowing of the earthly chivalry, as he certainly did not
succumb to the attraction of a militant Arthur, the victorious King of
Britain who successfully challenges the Roman Empire. Malory, we may
say, adapting Cassio, is to be relished more in the soldier than in the
scholar. Caxton was mildly concerned, too, at what Ascham was to call
‘open manslaughter and bold bawdrye’. His counsel to the reader is
plain: ‘Doo after the good and leve the evyl, and it shal brynge you to
good fame and renommee But for all that, Caxton grasped that the book he
made was to be called the Morte Darthur, in spite of the obvious
objection – ‘Notwythstondyng it treateth of the byrth, lyf, and actes of
the sayd kyng Arthur …’ The Morte, Caxton sees, takes precedence, and
the rest falls into shape -</p>
<p>… his noble knyghtes of the rounde table, theyr meruayllous enquestes
and adventures, thachyeuyng of the sangreal, andandandand in thende the
dolorous deth andandandand departyng out of thys world of them al.</p>
<p>This has the right proportions: we begin and end with the great event
towards which all tends and in virtue of which all has significance.
Here is another Englishman who has his eye on what is of final
importance: though for Caxton the centre of attention is not Arthur the
exemplar of the military virtues, but Arthur the undoubted king,
‘reputed and taken for one of the nine worthy, and the fyrst of the thre
Crysten men’. So Caxton is entitled to his place as a maker of the
English Arthuriad. The book he issues, ‘by me deuyded in to XXI bookes
chapytred’, is the work that has been known to all those who, so far,
have re-created ‘Malory’. C. S. Lewis suggests that the true state of
our ‘English prose Morte,’ as he calls it, is to be likened to ‘a great
cathedral, where Saxon, Norman, Gothic, Renaissance, and Georgian
elements all co-exist, and all grow together into something strange and
admirable which none of its successive builders intended or foresaw’. In
that tradition, Lewis argues, Caxton, too, was a builder: and ‘the
greatest service that he did the old fabric was one of demolition’, in
abridging ‘the whole dreary business’ of the Roman war.1 The modern
reader who is wholly intent on Malory, on seeing what he in fact wrote,
and tracing out, it may be, his errors and false paths as well as his
admitted triumphs, can now turn to Vinaver’s irreproachable Works of Sir
Thomas Malory. Those who wish to revisit the Morte Darthur, the book as
Caxton shaped it, have their text in the present volume. Each party has
its own pleasure and profit; and each can contribute to the common stock
of perpetual interest in Arthurian story.</p>
<p>The Once and Future King and Camelot are one line of development. The
Grail moves among men once more in Charles Williams’s War in Heaven
(1930); and Merlin, risen from the dead, is drawn into yet another
battle against the forces of evil in C. S. Lewis’s That Hideous Strength
(1945). Who is to say that the beguiling stories interwoven with the
great name of Arthur – Arturi regis ambages pulcerrime – will have no
appeal for succeeding generations? Even where the source is not Malory,
there is recognition of his distinctive appeal. The Waste Land is a
highly individual response to Jessie Weston and to Frazer: but Eliot had
read enough Malory to see Tennyson as ‘Chaucer retold for children’.2
John Cowper Powys, casting an ancient spell on modern Glastonbury, deals
in a great mystery – ‘that beautiful and terrible force by which the
lies of great creative Nature give birth to truth that is to be’. But
the language in which it is realized is inseparable from a sense of
England and the English past:</p>
<p>And John thought, ‘I’m English and she’s English and this is
England.’ … And without formulating the thought in words he got the
impression of the old anonymous ballads writ in northern dialect and
full of cold winds and cold sword-points and cold spades and cold
rivers; an impression wherein the chilly green grass and the peewits’
cries made woman’s love into a wild, stoical, romantic thing; and yet a
thing calling out for bread and bed and candlelight.</p>
<p>The width and variety of response to Arthurian story, in authors
French and English, named and anonymous, reinforces one truth that
applies equally to Malory and to the authors of the French cycle, as it
applies to all, medieval or modern, who take up the old stories. Each
draws from the common store according to the measure of his
understanding: quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis. What
each in his turn makes is to be judged in its own light. The source
itself remains undiminished.</p>

<p>Caxton’s Original Preface</p>
<p>After that I had accomplished and finished divers histories, as well
of contemplation as of other historial and worldly acts of great
conquerors and princes, and also certain books of examples and doctrine,
many noble and divers gentlemen of this realm of England camen and
demanded me, many and ofttimes, wherefore that I have not do made and
imprint the noble history of the Sangrail, and of the most renowned
Christian king, first and chief of the three best Christian and worthy,
King Arthur, which ought most to be remembered among us English men
tofore all other Christian kings.</p>
<p>For it is notoyrly known through the universal world that there be
nine worthy and the best that ever were, that is to wit, three paynims,
three Jews, and three Christian men. As for the paynims, they were
tofore the Incarnation of Christ, which were named: the first, Hector of
Troy, of whom the history is comen both in ballad and in prose; the
second, Alexander the Great; and the third, Julius Caesar, Emperor of
Rome, of whom the histories be well-known and had. And as for the three
Jews, which also were tofore the Incarnation of our Lord, of whom the
first was Duke Joshua, which brought the children of Israel into the
land of behest, the second David, King of Jerusalem, and the third Judas
Maccabaeus, of these three the Bible rehearseth all their noble
histories and acts. And sith the said Incarnation have been three noble
Christian men stalled and admitted through the universal world into the
number of the nine best and worthy, of whom was first the noble Arthur,
whose noble acts I purpose to write in this present book here following.
The second was Charlemagne, or Charles the Great, of whom the history is
had in many places both in French and in English; and the third and last
was Godfrey of Bouillon, 1 of whose acts and life I made a book unto the
excellent prince and king of noble memory. King Edward the Fourth.</p>
<p>The said noble gentlemen instantly required me to imprint the history
of the said noble king and conqueror, King Arthur, and of his knights,
with the history of the Sangrail, and of the death and ending of the
said Arthur, affirming that I ought rather to imprint his acts and noble
feats, than of Godfrey of Bouillon, or any of the other eight,
considering that he was a man born within this realm, and king and
emperor of the same; and that there be in French divers and many noble
volumes of his acts, and also of his knights.</p>
<p>To whom I answered, that divers men hold opinion that there was no
such Arthur, and that all such books as be made of him be but feigned
and fables, because that some chronicles make of him no mention nor
remember him nothing, ne of his knights.</p>
<p>Whereto they answered, and one in special said, that in him that
should say or think that there was never such a king called Arthur might
well be aretted great folly and blindness; for he said that there were
many evidences of the contrary: first, ye may see his sepulture in the
Monastery of Glastonbury; and also in Polichronicon,2 in the fifth book,
the sixth chapter, and in the seventh book the twenty-third chapter,
where his body was buried, and after founden and translated into the
said monastery. Ye shall see also in the history of Boccaccio, in his
book De Casu Principum, part of his noble acts, and also of his fall.
Also Galfridus in his British book3 recounteth his life. And in divers
places of England many remembrances be yet of him and shall remain
perpetually, and also of his knights. First in the Abbey of Westminster,
at Saint Edward’s shrine, remaineth the print of his seal in red wax
closed in beryl, in which is written: Patricius, Arthurus, Britannie,
Gallie, Germanie, Dacie, Imperator. Item in the castle of Dover ye may
see Gawain’s skull and Craddock’s mantle; at Winchester, the Round
Table; in other places, Launcelot’s sword and many other things. Then
all these things considered, there can no man reasonably gainsay but
there was a king of this land named Arthur. For in all places, Christian
and heathen, he is reputed and taken for one of the nine worthy, and the
first of the three Christian men. And also he is more spoken of beyond
the sea, more books made of his noble acts than there be in England, as
well in Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and Greek, as in French. And yet of
record remain in witness of him in Wales, in the town of Camelot, the
great stones and marvellous works of iron lying under the ground, and
royal vaults, which divers now living hath seen. Wherefore it is a
marvel why he is no more renowned in his own country, save only it
accordeth to the word of God, which saith that no man is accepted for a
prophet in his own country.</p>
<p>Then, all these things foresaid alleged, I could not well deny but
that there was such a noble king named Arthur, and reputed one of the
nine worthy, and first and chief of the Christian men. And many noble
volumes be made of him and of his noble knights in French, which I have
seen and read beyond the sea, which be not had in our maternal tongue,
but in Welsh be many and also in French and some in English, but no
where nigh all. Wherefore, such as have late been drawn out briefly into
English I have after the simple cunning that God hath sent to me, under
the favour and correction of all noble lords and gentlemen, enprised to
imprint a book of the noble histories of the said King Arthur, and of
certain of his knights, after a copy unto me delivered, which copy Sir
Thomas Malory did take out of certain books of French, and reduced it
into English.</p>
<p>And I, according to my copy, have done set it in imprint, to the
intent that noble men may see and learn the noble acts of chivalry, the
gentle and virtuous deeds that some knights used in those days, by which
they came to honour; and how they that were vicious were punished and
oft put to shame and rebuke; humbly beseeching all noble lords and
ladies, with all other estates, of what estate or degree they be of,
that shall see and read in this said book and work, that they take the
good and honest acts in their remembrance, and to follow the same,
wherein they shall find many joyous and pleasant histories, and noble
and renowned acts of humanity, gentleness, and chivalries. For herein
may be seen noble chivalry, courtesy, humanity, friendliness, hardiness,
love, friendship, cowardice, murder, hate, virtue, and sin. Do after the
good and leave the evil, and it shall bring you to good fame and
renown.</p>
<p>And for to pass the time this book shall be pleasant to read in; but
for to give faith and believe that all is true that is contained herein,
ye be at your liberty. But all is written for our doctrine, and for to
beware that we fall not to vice ne sin, but to exercise and follow
virtue, by which we may come and attain to good fame and renown in this
life, and after this short and transitory life, to come unto everlasting
bliss in heaven, the which he grant us that reigneth in heaven, the
blessed Trinity. Amen.</p>
<p>Then to proceed forth in this said book, which I direct unto all
noble princes, lords and ladies, gentlemen or gentlewomen, that desire
to read or hear read of the noble and joyous history of the great
conqueror and excellent king, King Arthur, sometime king of this noble
realm, then called Britain: I, William Caxton, simple person, present
this book following, which I have enprised to imprint; and treateth of
the noble acts, feats of arms of chivalry, prowess, hardiness, humanity,
