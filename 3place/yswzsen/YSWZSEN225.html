<h4 id="chapter-29">Chapter 29</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram behaved him the first day of the tournament, and
there he had the prize</p>
<p>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram de Liones, that commanded Gouvernail,
his servant, to ordain him a black shield with none other remembrance
therein. And so Sir Persides and Sir Tristram departed from their host
Sir Pellounes, and they rode early toward the tournament, and then they
drew them to King Carados’ side, of Scotland.</p>
<p>And anon knights began the field, what of King Northgales’ part, and
what of King Carados’ part, and there began great party. Then there was
hurling and rashing. Right so came in Sir Persides and Sir Tristram, and
so they did fare that they put the King of Northgales aback.</p>
<p>Then came in Sir Bleoberis de Ganis and Sir Gaheris with them of
Northgales, and then was Sir Persides smitten down and almost slain, for
more than forty horsemen went over him. For Sir Bleoberis did great
deeds of arms, and Sir Gaheris failed him not.</p>
<p>When Sir Tristram beheld them, and saw them do such deeds of arms, he
marvelled what they were. Also Sir Tristram thought shame that Sir
Persides was so done to; and then he gat a great spear in his hand, and
then he rode to Sir Gaheris and smote him down from his horse. And then
was Sir Bleoberis wroth, and gat a spear and rode against Sir Tristram
in great ire; and there Sir Tristram met with him, and smote Sir
Bleoberis from his horse.</p>
<p>So then the King with the Hundred Knights was wroth, and he horsed
Sir Bleoberis and Sir Gaheris again, and there began a great medley; and
ever Sir Tristram held them passing short, and ever Sir Bleoberis was
passing busy upon Sir Tristram. And there came Sir Dinadan against Sir
Tristram, and Sir Tristram gave him such a buffet that he swooned in his
saddle.</p>
<p>Then anon Sir Dinadan came to Sir Tristram and said, ‘Sir, I know
thee better than thou weenest; but here I promise thee my troth I will
never come against thee more, for I promise thee that sword of thine
shall never come on mine helm.’</p>
<p>With that came Sir Bleoberis, and Sir Tristram gave him such a buffet
that down he laid his head; and then he raught him so sore by the helm
that he pulled him under his horse’s feet.</p>
<p>And then King Arthur blew to lodging. Then Sir Tristram departed to
his pavilion, and Sir Dinadan rode with him; and Sir Persides and King
Arthur then, and the kings upon both parties, marvelled what knight that
was with the black shield. Many said their advice, and some knew him for
Sir Tristram, and held their peace and would nought say. So that first
day King Arthur, and all the kings and lords that were judges, gave Sir
Tristram the prize; howbeit they knew him not, but named him the Knight
with the Black Shield.</p>
