<h4 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h4>
<p>How King Arthur sent Sir Gawain and other to Lucius, and how they
were assailed and escaped with worship</p>
<p>Then the king did do call Sir Gawain, Sir Bors, Sir Lionel, and Sir
Bedevere, and commanded them to go straight to Sir Lucius, ‘and say ye
to him that hastily he remove out of my land; and if he will not, bid
him make him ready to battle and not distress the poor people’.</p>
<p>Then anon these noble knights dressed them to horseback, and when
they came to the green wood, they saw many pavilions set in a meadow, of
silk of divers colours, beside a river, and the emperor’s pavilion was
in the middle with an eagle displayed above. To the which tent our
knights rode toward, and ordained Sir Gawain and Sir Bors to do the
message, and left in a bushment Sir Lionel and Sir Bedevere.</p>
<p>And then Sir Gawain and Sir Bors did their message, and commanded
Lucius, in Arthur’s name to avoid his land, or shortly to address him to
battle. To whom Lucius answered and said, ‘Ye shall return to your lord,
and say ye to him that I shall subdue him and all his lands.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Gawain was wroth and said, ‘I had lever than all France
fight against thee.’</p>
<p>‘And so had I,’ said Sir Bors, ‘lever than all Brittany or
Burgundy.’</p>
<p>Then a knight named Sir Gainus, nigh cousin to the emperor, said,
‘Lo, how these Britons be full of pride and boast, and they brag as
though they bare up all the world.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Gawain was sore grieved with these words, and pulled out his
sword and smote off his head. And therewith turned their horses and rode
over waters and through woods till they came to their bushment, whereas
Sir Lionel and Sir Bedevere were hoving.</p>
<p>The Romans followed fast after, on horseback and on foot, over a
champaign unto a wood; then Sir Bors turned his horse and saw a knight
came fast on, whom he smote through the body with a spear that he fell
dead down to the earth; then came Caliburn one of the strongest of
Pavie, and smote down many of Arthur’s knights. And when Sir Bors saw
him do so much harm, he addressed toward him, and smote him through the
breast, that he fell down dead to the earth. Then Sir Feldenak thought
to revenge the death of Gainus upon Sir Gawain, but Sir Gawain was ware
thereof, and smote him on the head, which stroke stinted not till it
came to his breast.</p>
<p>And then he returned and came to his fellows in the bushment. And
there was a recounter, for the bushment brake on the Romans, and slew
and hew down the Romans, and forced the Romans to flee and return, whom
the noble knights chased unto their tents.</p>
<p>Then the Romans gathered more people, and also foot-men came on, and
there was a new battle, and so much people that Sir Bors and Sir Berel
were taken. But when Sir Gawain saw that, he took with him Sir Idrus the
good knight, and said he would never see King Arthur but if he rescued
them, and pulled out Galatine his good sword, and followed them that led
those two knights away; and he smote him that led Sir Bors, and took Sir
Bors from him and delivered him to his fellows. And Sir Idrus in
likewise rescued Sir Berel.</p>
<p>Then began the battle to be great, that our knights were in great
jeopardy, wherefore Sir Gawain sent to King Arthur for succour, and that
he hie him, ‘for I am sore wounded, and that our prisoners may pay good
out of number.’</p>
<p>And the messenger came to the king and told him his message. And anon
the king did do assemble his army, but anon, or he departed, the
prisoners were comen, and Sir Gawain and his fellows gat the field and
put the Romans to flight, and after returned and came with their
fellowship in such wise that no man of worship was lost of them, save
that Sir Gawain was sore hurt. Then the king did do ransack his wounds
and comforted him.</p>
<p>And thus was the beginning of the first journey of the Britons and
Romans, and there were slain of the Romans more than ten thousand, and
great joy and mirth was made that night in the host of King Arthur. And
on the morn he sent all the prisoners into Paris under the guard of Sir
Launce-lot, with many knights, and of Sir Cador.</p>
<p>bushment: ambush.</p>
