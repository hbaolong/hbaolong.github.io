<h4 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h4>
<p>How La Beale Isoud sent letters to Sir Tristram by her maid
Bragwaine, and of divers adventures of Sir Tristram</p>
<p>Now leave we here Sir La Cote Male Taile, and turn we unto Sir
Tristram de Liones that was in Brittany. When La Beale Isoud understood
that he was wedded she sent to him by her maid Bragwaine as piteous
letters as could be thought and made, and her conclusion was that, and
it pleased Sir Tristram, that he would come to her court, and bring with
him Isoud la Blanche Mains, and they should be kept as well as she
herself.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram called unto him Sir Kehydius, and asked him whether
he would go with him into Cornwall secretly. He answered him that he was
ready at all times. And then he let ordain privily a little vessel, and
therein they went, Sir Tristram, Kehydius, Dame Bragwaine, and
Gouvernail, Sir Tristram’s squire.</p>
<p>So when they were in the sea a contrarious wind blew them on the
coasts of North Wales, nigh the Castle Perilous.</p>
<p>Then said Sir Tristram, ‘Here shall ye abide me these ten days, and
Gouvernail, my squire, with you. And if so be I come not again by that
day, take the next way into Cornwall; for in this forest are many
strange adventures, as I have heard say, and some of them I cast me to
prove or I depart. And when I may I shall hie me after you.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram and Kehydius took their horses and departed from
their fellowship. And so they rode within that forest a mile and more;
and at the last Sir Tristram saw afore him a likely knight armed sitting
by a well, and a strong mighty horse passing nigh him tied to an oak,
and a man hoving and riding by him leading an horse lade with spears.
And this knight that sat at the well seemed by his countenance to be
passing heavy.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram rode near him and said, ‘Fair knight, why sit ye so
drooping? Ye seem to be a knight errant by your arms and harness, and
therefore dress you to joust with one of us, or with both.’</p>
<p>Therewithal that knight made no words, but took his shield and
buckled it about his neck, and lightly he took his horse and leapt upon
him. And then he took a great spear of his squire, and departed his way
a furlong.</p>
<p>Sir Kehydius asked leave of Sir Tristram to joust first.</p>
<p>‘Do your best,’ said Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>So they met together, and there Sir Kehydius had a fall, and was sore
wounded on high above the paps.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram said, ‘Knight, that is well jousted, now make you
ready unto me.’</p>
<p>‘I am ready,’ said the knight. And then that knight took a greater
spear in his hand, and encountered with Sir Tristram, and there by great
force that knight smote down Sir Tristram from his horse and had a great
fall.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram was sore ashamed, and lightly he avoided his horse,
and put his shield afore his shoulder, and drew his sword. And then Sir
Tristram required that knight of his knighthood to alight upon foot and
fight with him.</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said the knight.</p>
<p>And so he alit upon foot, and avoided his horse, and cast his shield
upon his shoulder, and drew his sword, and there they fought a long
battle together full nigh two hours.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram said, ‘Fair knight, hold thine hand, and tell me of
whence thou art, and what is thy name.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said the knight, ‘I will be advised; but and thou wilt
tell me thy name peradventure I will tell thee mine.’</p>
