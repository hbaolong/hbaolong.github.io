<h4 id="chapter-21">Chapter 21</h4>
<p>How Sir Gareth, otherwise called Beaumains, came to the presence of
his lady, and how they took acquaintance, and of their love</p>
<p>And then came forth Dame Lyonesse arrayed like a princess, and there
she made him passing good cheer, and he her again; and they had goodly
language and lovely countenance together.</p>
<p>And Sir Gareth thought many times, ‘Jesu, would that the lady of the
Castle Perilous were so fair as she was.’</p>
<p>There were all manner of games and plays, of dancing and singing. And
ever the more Sir Gareth beheld that lady, the more he loved her; and so
he burned in love that he was past himself in his reason; and forth
toward night they yede unto supper, and Sir Gareth might not eat, for
his love was so hot that he wist not where he was.</p>
<p>All these looks espied Sir Gringamore, and then at after-supper he
called his sister Dame Lyonesse unto a chamber, and said, ‘Fair sister,
I have well espied your countenance betwixt you and this knight, and I
will, sister, that ye wit he is a full noble knight, and if ye can make
him to abide here I will do him all the pleasure that I can, for and ye
were better than ye are, ye were well bewared upon him.’</p>
<p>‘Fair brother,’ said Dame Lyonesse, ‘I understand well that the
knight is good, and come he is of a noble house. Notwithstanding, I will
assay him better, howbeit I am most beholding to him of any earthly man;
for he hath had great labour for my love, and passed many a dangerous
passage.’</p>
<p>Right so Sir Gringamore went unto Sir Gareth, and said, ‘Sir, make ye
good cheer, for ye shall have none other cause, for this lady, my
sister, is yours at all times, her worship saved, for wit ye well she
loveth you as well as ye do her, and better if better may be.’</p>
<p>‘And I wist that,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘there lived not a gladder man
than I would be.’</p>
<p>‘Upon my worship,’ said Sir Gringamore, ‘trust unto my promise; and
as long as it liketh you ye shall sojourn with me, and this lady shall
be with us daily and nightly to make you all the cheer that she
can.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘for I have promised to be nigh this
country this twelvemonth. And well I am sure King Arthur and other noble
knights will find me where that I am within this twelvemonth. For I
shall be sought and founden, if that I be alive.’</p>
<p>And then the noble knight Sir Gareth went unto the Dame Lyonesse,
which he then much loved, and kissed her many times, and either made
great joy of other. And there she promised him her love certainly, to
love him and none other the days of her life. Then this lady, Dame
Lyonesse, by the assent of her brother, told Sir Gareth all the truth
what she was, and how she was the same lady that he did battle for, and
how she was lady of the Castle Perilous, and there she told him how she
caused her brother to take away his dwarf.</p>
<p>bewared: bestowed.</p>
