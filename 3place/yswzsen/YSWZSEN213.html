<h4 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram departed from Tintagel, and how he sorrowed and was
so long in a forest till he was out of his mind</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram dread sore lest he were discovered unto the king
that he was there; wherefore he drew him to the strength of the tower,
and armed him in such armour as he had for to fight with them that would
withstand him.</p>
<p>And so when Sir Tristram saw there was no resistance against him he
sent Gouvernail for his horse and his spear, and knightly he rode forth
out of the castle openly, that was called the Castle of Tintagel. And
even at the gate he met with Gingalin, Sir Gawain’s son.</p>
<p>And anon Sir Gingalin put his spear in his rest, and ran upon Sir
Tristram and brake his spear; and Sir Tristram at that time had but a
sword, and gave him such a buffet upon the helm that he fell down from
his saddle, and his sword slid adown, and carved asunder his horse’s
neck.</p>
<p>And so Sir Tristram rode his way into the forest. And all this doing
saw King Mark. And then he sent a squire unto the hurt knight, and
commanded him to come to him, and so he did. And when King Mark wist
that it was Sir Gingalin he welcomed him and gave him an horse, and
asked him what knight it was that had encountered with him.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Gingalin, ‘I wot not what knight he was, but well I
wot that he sigheth and maketh great dole.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram within a while met with a knight of his own, that
hight Sir Fergus. And when he had met with him he made great sorrow,
insomuch that he fell down off his horse in a swoon, and in such sorrow
he was in three days and three nights.</p>
<p>Then at the last Sir Tristram sent unto the court by Sir Fergus, for
to spere what tidings. And so as he rode by the way he met with a
damosel that came from Sir Palomides, to know and seek how Sir Tristram
did. Then Sir Fergus told her how he was almost out of his mind.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said the damosel, ‘where shall I find him?’</p>
<p>‘In such a place,’ said Sir Fergus.</p>
<p>Then Sir Fergus found Queen Isoud sick in her bed, making the
greatest dole that ever any earthly woman made.</p>
<p>And when the damosel found Sir Tristram she made great dole because
she might not amend him, for the more she made of him the more was his
pain. And at the last Sir Tristram took his horse and rode away from
her. And then was it three days or that she could find him, and then she
brought him meat and drink, but he would none.</p>
<p>And then another time Sir Tristram escaped away from the damosel, and
it happed him to ride by the same castle where Sir Palomides and Sir
Tristram did battle when La Beale Isoud departed them. And there by
fortune the damosel met with Sir Tristram again, making the greatest
dole that ever earthly creature made; and she yede to the lady of that
castle and told her of the misadventure of Sir Tristam.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said the lady of that castle, ‘where is my lord, Sir
Tristram?’</p>
<p>‘Right here by your castle,’ said the damosel.</p>
<p>‘In good time,’ said the lady, ‘is he so nigh me; he shall have meat
and drink of the best; and an harp I have of his whereupon he taught me,
for of goodly harping he beareth the prize in the world.’</p>
<p>So this lady and damosel brought him meat and drink, but he ate
little thereof. Then upon a night he put his horse from him, and then he
unlaced his armour, and then Sir Tristram would go into the wilderness,
and brast down the trees and boughs; and otherwhile when he found the
harp that the lady sent him, then would he harp, and play thereupon and
weep together. And sometime when Sir Tristram was in the wood that the
lady wist not where he was, then would she sit her down and play upon
that harp: then would Sir Tristram come to that harp, and hearken
thereto, and sometime he would harp himself.</p>
<p>Thus he there endured a quarter of a year. Then at the last he ran
his way, and she wist not where he was become. And then was he naked and
waxed lean and poor of flesh; and so he fell in the fellowship of
herdmen and shepherds, and daily they would give him some of their meat
and drink. And when he did any shrewd deed they would beat him with
rods, and so they clipped him with shears and made him like a fool.</p>
