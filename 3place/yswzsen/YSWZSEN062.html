<h4 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h4>
<p>How when he was comen to Camelot he was sworn upon a book to tell the
truth of his quest</p>
<p>And therewith they departed, and came thereas the head of the lady
lay with a fair yellow hair, that grieved King Pellinor passingly sore
when he looked on it, for much he cast his heart on the visage. And so
by noon they came to Camelot; and the king and the queen were passing
fain of his coming to the court. And there he was made to swear upon the
four Evangelists, to tell the truth of his quest from the one to the
other.</p>
<p>‘Ah! Sir Pellinor,’ said Queen Guenever, ‘ye were greatly to blame
that ye saved not this lady’s life.’</p>
<p>‘Madam,’ said Pellinor, ‘ye were greatly to blame and ye would not
save your own life and ye might, but, save your pleasure, I was so
furious in my quest that I would not abide, and that repenteth me, and
shall the days of my life.’</p>
<p>‘Truly,’ said Merlin, ‘ye ought sore to repent it, for that lady was
your own daughter begotten on the Lady of the Rule, and that knight that
was dead was her love, and should have wedded her, and he was a right
good knight of a young man, and would have proved a good man, and to
this court was he coming, and his name was Sir Miles of the Launds, and
a knight came behind him and slew him with a spear, and his name is
Loraine le Savage, a false knight and a coward; and she for great sorrow
and dole slew herself with his sword, and her name was Elaine. And
because ye would not abide and help her, ye shall see your best friend
fail you when ye be in the greatest distress that ever ye were or shall
be. And that penance God hath ordained you for that deed, that he that
ye shall most trust to of any man alive, he shall leave you there ye
shall be slain.’</p>
<p>‘Me forthinketh,’ said King Pellinor, ‘that this shall me betide, but
God may fordo well destiny.’</p>
<p>1Thus, when the quest was done of the white hart, the which followed
Sir Gawain, and the quest of the brachet, followed of Sir Tor,
Pellinor’s son, and the quest of the lady that the knight took away, the
which King Pellinor at that time followed, then the king stablished all
his knights, and gave them that were of lands not rich, he gave them
lands, and charged them never to do outrageousity nor murder, and always
to flee treason; also, by no mean to be cruel, but to give mercy unto
him that asketh mercy, upon pain of forfeiture of their worship and
lordship of King Arthur for evermore; and always to do ladies, damosels,
and gentlewomen succour, upon pain of death. Also, that no man take no
battles in a wrongful quarrel for no law, ne for no world’s goods. Unto
this were all the knights sworn of the Table Round, both old and young.
And every year were they sworn at the high feast of Pentecost.</p>
