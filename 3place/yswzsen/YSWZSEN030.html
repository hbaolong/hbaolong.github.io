<h4 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h4>
<p>How Balin, arrayed like a poor knight, pulled out the sword, which
afterward was cause of his death</p>
<p>Then fell it so that time there was a poor knight with King Arthur,
that had been prisoner with him half a year and more for slaying of a
knight, the which was cousin unto King Arthur. The name of this knight
was called Balin, and by good means of the barons he was delivered out
of prison, for he was a good man named of his body, and he was born in
Northumberland; and so he went privily into the court, and saw this
adventure, whereof it raised his heart, and would assay it as other
knights did, but for he was poor and poorly arrayed he put him not far
in press; but in his heart he was fully assured to do as well, if his
grace happed him, as any knight that there was. And as the damosel took
her leave of Arthur and of all the barons, so departing, this knight
Balin called unto her, and said,</p>
<p>‘Damosel, I pray you of your courtesy, suffer me as well to assay as
these lords; though that I be so poorly clothed, in my heart meseemeth I
am fully assured as some of these other, and meseemeth in my heart to
speed right well.’</p>
<p>The damosel beheld the poor knight, and saw he was a likely man, but
for his poor arrayment she thought he should be of no worship without
villainy or treachery. And then she said unto the knight, ‘Sir, it
needeth not to put me to more pain or labour, for it seemeth not you to
speed thereas other have failed.’</p>
<p>‘Ah! fair damosel,’ said Balin, ‘worthiness, and good tatches, and
good deeds, are not only in arrayment, but manhood and worship is hid
within man’s person, and many a worshipful knight is not known unto all
people, and therefore worship and hardiness is not in arrayment.’</p>
<p>‘By God,’ said the damosel, ‘ye say sooth; therefore ye shall assay
to do what ye may.’</p>
<p>Then Balin took the sword by the girdle and sheath, and drew it out
easily; and when he looked on the sword it pleased him much. Then had
the king and all the barons great marvel that Balin had done that
adventure; many knights had great despite at Balin.</p>
<p>‘Certes,’ said the damosel, ‘this is a passing good knight, and the
best that ever I found, and most of worship without treason, treachery,
or villainy, and many marvels shall he do. Now, gentle and courteous
knight, give me the sword again.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Balin, ‘for this sword will I keep, but it be taken from
me with force.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said the damosel, ‘ye are not wise to keep the sword from me,
for ye shall slay with the sword the best friend that ye have, and the
man that ye most love in the world, and the sword shall be your
destruction.’</p>
<p>‘I shall take the adventure,’ said Balin, ‘that God will ordain me,
but the sword ye shall not have at this time, by the faith of my
body,’</p>
<p>‘Ye shall repent it within short time,’ said the damosel, ‘for I
would have the sword more for your avail than for mine, for I am passing
heavy for your sake; for ye will not believe that sword shall be your
destruction, and that is great pity,’ With that the damosel departed,
making great sorrow.</p>
<p>Anon after, Balin sent for his horse and armour, and so would depart
from the court, and took his leave of King Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said the king, ‘I suppose ye will not depart so lightly from
this fellowship, I suppose ye are displeased that I have showed you
unkindness. Blame me the less, for I was misinformed against you, but I
weened ye had not been such a knight as ye are of worship and prowess,
and if ye will abide in this court among my fellowship, I shall so
advance you as ye shall be pleased.’</p>
<p>‘God thank your highness,’ said Balin, ‘your bounty and highness may
no man praise half to the value; but at this time I must needs depart,
beseeching you alway of your good grace.’</p>
<p>‘Truly,’ said the king, ‘I am right wroth for your departing; I pray
you, fair knight, that ye tarry not long, and ye shall be right welcome
to me, and to my barons, and I shall amend all miss that I have done
against you.’</p>
<p>‘God thank your great lordship,’ said Balin, and therewith made him
ready to depart.</p>
<p>Then the most part of the knights of the Round Table said that Balin
did not this adventure all only by might, but by witchcraft.</p>
<p>in press: in the crowd. tatches: qualities.</p>
<p>adventure: fortune.</p>
