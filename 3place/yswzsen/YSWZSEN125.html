<h4 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h4>
<p>How Beaumains told to Sir Launcelot his name, and how he was dubbed
knight of Sir Launcelot, and after overtook the damosel</p>
<p>‘In God’s name,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘for I promise you, by the faith
of my body, I had as much to do as I might to save myself from you
unshamed, and therefore have ye no doubt of none earthly knight.’</p>
<p>‘Hope ye so that I may any while stand a proved knight?’ said
Beaumains.</p>
<p>‘Yea,’ said Launcelot, ‘do as ye have done, and I shall be your
warrant.’</p>
<p>‘Then, I pray you,’ said Beaumains, ‘give me the order of
knighthood.’</p>
<p>‘Then must ye tell me your name,’ said Launcelot, ‘and of what kin ye
be born.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, so that ye will not discover me I shall,’ said Beaumains.</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘and that I promise you by the faith of my
body until it be openly known.’</p>
<p>‘Then, sir,’ he said, ‘my name is Gareth, and brother unto Sir Gawain
of father and mother.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, sir,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘I am more gladder of you than I was;
for ever me thought ye should be of great blood, and that ye came not to
the court neither for meat ne for drink.’</p>
<p>And then Sir Launcelot gave him the order of knighthood, and then Sir
Gareth prayed him for to depart and let him go.</p>
<p>So Sir Launcelot departed from him and came to Sir Kay, and made him
to be borne home upon his shield, and so he was healed hard with the
life; and all men scorned Sir Kay, and in especial Sir Gawain and Sir
Launcelot said it was not his part to rebuke no young man, for full
little knew he of what birth he is comen, and for what cause he came to
this court!’ and so we leave Sir Kay and turn we unto Beaumains.</p>
<p>When he had overtaken the damosel, anon she said, ‘What dost thou
here? Thou stinkest all of the kitchen, thy clothes be bawdy of the
grease and tallow that thou gainest in King Arthur’s kitchen; weenest
thou,’ said she, ‘that I allow thee, for yonder knight that thou
killest? Nay truly, for thou slewest him unhappily and cowardly;
therefore turn again, bawdy kitchen page, I know thee well, for Sir Kay
named thee Beaumains. What art thou but a lusk and a turner of broches
and a ladle-washer?’</p>
<p>‘Damosel,’ said Beaumains, ‘say to me what ye will, I will not go
from you whatsoméver ye say, for I have undertake to King Arthur for to
achieve your adventure, and so shall I finish it to the end, either I
shall die therefore,’</p>
<p>‘Fie on thee, kitchen knave, wilt thou finish mine adventure? Thou
shalt anon be met withal, that thou wouldest not for all the broth that
ever thou suppest once look him in the face.’</p>
<p>‘I shall assay,’ said Beaumains.</p>
<p>So thus as they rode in the wood, there came a man fleeing all that
ever he might.</p>
<p>‘Whither wilt thou?’ said Beaumains.</p>
<p>‘O lord,’ he said, ‘help me, for here by in a slade are six thieves
that have taken my lord and bound him, so I am afeared lest they will
slay him.’</p>
<p>‘Bring me thither,’ said Beaumains.</p>
<p>And so they rode together until they came there as was the knight
bounden; and then he rode unto them, and struck one unto the death, and
then another, and at the third stroke he slew a third thief, and then
the other three fled. And he rode after them, and he overtook them; and
then those three thieves turned again and assailed Beaumains hard, but
at the last he slew them, and returned and unbound the knight. And the
knight thanked him, and prayed him to ride with him to his castle there
a little beside, and he should worship-fully reward him for his good
deeds.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Beaumains, ‘I will no reward have. I was this day made
knight of noble Sir Launcelot, and therefore I will no reward have, but
God reward me. And also I must follow this damosel.’</p>
<p>And when he came nigh her she bad him ride from her. ‘For thou
smellest all of the kitchen. Weenest thou that I have joy of thee? For
all this deed that thou hast done is but mishappen thee; but thou shalt
see a sight shall make thee turn again, and that lightly.’</p>
<p>Then the same knight which was rescued of the thieves rode after that
damosel, and prayed her to lodge with him all that night. And because it
was near night the damosel rode with him to his castle, and there they
had great cheer, and at supper the knight sat Sir Beaumains afore the
damosel.</p>
<p>‘Fie, fie,’ said she, ‘Sir knight, ye are uncourteous to set a
kitchen page afore me; him beseemeth better to stick a swine than to sit
afore a damosel of high parage.’</p>
<p>Then the knight was ashamed at her words, and took him up, and set
him at a sideboard, and set himself afore him, and so all that night
they had good cheer and merry rest.</p>
