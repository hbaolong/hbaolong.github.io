<h4 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h4>
<p>How Sir Lamorak met with Sir Meliagaunt, and fought together for the
beauty of Dame Guenever</p>
<p>Right so as they stood talking thus Sir Lamorak was ware how Sir
Launcelot came riding straight toward them; then Sir Lamorak saluted
him, and he him again. And then Sir Lamorak asked Sir Launcelot if there
were anything that he might do for him in these marches.</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘not at this time I thank you.’</p>
<p>Then either departed from other, and Sir Lamorak rode again thereas
he left the two knights, and then he found them hid in the leaved
wood.</p>
<p>‘Fie on you,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘false cowards, pity and shame it is
that any of you should take the high order of knighthood.’</p>
<p>So Sir Lamorak departed from them, and within a while he met with Sir
Meliagaunt. And then Sir Lamorak asked him why he loved Queen Guenever
as he did: ‘For I was not far from you when ye made your complaint by
the chapel.’</p>
<p>‘Did ye so?’ said Sir Meliagaunt, ‘then will I abide by it: I love
Queen Guenever, what will ye with it? I will prove and make good that
she is the fairest lady and most of beauty in the world.’</p>
<p>‘As to that,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘I say nay thereto, for Queen
Margawse of Orkney, mother to Sir Gawain, and his mother is the fairest
queen and lady that beareth the life.’</p>
<p>‘That is not so,’ said Sir Meliagaunt, ‘and that will I prove with my
hands upon thy body.’</p>
<p>‘Will ye so?’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘and in a better quarrel keep I not
to fight.’</p>
<p>Then they departed either from other in great wrath. And then they
came riding together as it had been thunder, and either smote other so
sore that their horses fell backward to the earth. And then they avoided
their horses, and dressed their shields, and drew their swords. And then
they hurtled together as wild boars, and thus they fought a great while.
For Meliagaunt was a good man and of great might, but Sir Lamorak was
hard big for him, and put him always aback, but either had wounded other
sore.</p>
<p>And as they stood thus fighting, by fortune came Sir Launcelot and
Sir Bleoberis riding. And then Sir Launcelot rode betwixt them, and
asked them for what cause they fought so together: ‘And ye are both
knights of King Arthur!’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Meliagaunt, ‘I shall tell you for what cause we do this
battle. I praised my lady, Queen Guenever, and said she was the fairest
lady of the world, and Sir Lamorak said nay thereto, for he said Queen
Margawse of Orkney was fairer than she and more of beauty.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, Sir Lamorak, why sayest thou so? It is not thy part to dispraise
thy princes that thou art under their obeisance, and we all.’ And
therewith he alit on foot, and said, ‘For this quarrel, make thee ready,
for I will prove upon thee that Queen Guenever is the fairest lady and
most of bounty in the world.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘I am loth to have ado with you in this
quarrel, for every man thinketh his own lady fairest; and though I
praise the lady that I love most ye should not be wroth; for though my
lady, Queen Guenever, be fairest in your eye, wit ye well Queen Margawse
of Orkney is fairest in mine eye, and so every knight thinketh his own
lady fairest; and wit ye well, sir, ye are the man in the world except
Sir Tristram that I am most lothest to have ado withal, but, and ye will
needs fight with me, I shall endure you as long as I may.’</p>
<p>Then spake Sir Bleoberis and said, ‘My lord Sir Launcelot, I wist you
never so misadvised as ye are now, for Sir Lamorak sayeth you but reason
and knightly; for I warn you I have a lady, and methinketh that she is
the fairest lady of the world. Were this a great reason that ye should
be wroth with me for such language? And well ye wot, that Sir Lamorak is
as noble a knight as I know, and he hath ought you and us ever good
will, and therefore I pray you be good friends.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Launcelot said unto Sir Lamorak, ‘I pray you forgive me mine
evil will, and if I was misadvised I will amend it.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘the amends is soon made betwixt you and
me.’</p>
<p>And so Sir Launcelot and Sir Bleoberis departed, and Sir Meliagaunt
and Sir Lamorak took their horses, and either departed from other.</p>
<p>And within a while came King Arthur, and met with Sir Lamorak, and
jousted with him; and there he smote down Sir Lamorak, and wounded him
sore with a spear, and so he rode from him; wherefore Sir Lamorak was
wroth that he would not fight with him on foot, howbeit that Sir Lamorak
knew not King Arthur.</p>
