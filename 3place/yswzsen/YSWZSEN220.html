<h4 id="chapter-24">Chapter 24</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram jousted with Sir Kay and Sir Sagramore le Desirous,
and how Sir Gawain turned Sir Tristram from Morgan le Fay</p>
<p>But anon as the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, heard of the shield of
Cornwall, then wist he well that it was Sir Tristram that fought with
his enemies. And then Sir Launcelot praised Sir Tristram, and called him
the man of most worship in the world.</p>
<p>So there was a knight in that priory that hight Pellinor, and he
desired to wit the name of Sir Tristram, but in no wise he could not.
And so Sir Tristram departed and left Sir Dinadan in the priory, for he
was so weary and so sore bruised that he might not ride.</p>
<p>Then this knight, Sir Pellinor, said to Sir Dinadan, ‘Sithen that ye
will not tell me that knight’s name I will ride after him and make him
to tell me his name, or he shall die therefore.’</p>
<p>‘Beware, sir knight,’ said Sir Dinadan, ‘for and ye follow him ye
shall repent it.’</p>
<p>So that knight, Sir Pellinor, rode after Sir Tristram and required
him of jousts. Then Sir Tristram smote him down and wounded him through
the shoulder, and so he passed on his way.</p>
<p>And on the next day following Sir Tristram met with pursuivants, and
they told him that there was made a great cry of tournament between King
Carados of Scotland and the King of North Wales, and either should joust
against other at the Castle of Maidens; and these pursuivants sought all
the country after the good knights, and in especial King Carados let
make seeking for Sir Launcelot du Lake, and the King of Northgales let
seek after Sir Tristram de Liones. And at that time Sir Tristram thought
to be at that jousts; and so by adventure they met with Sir Kay, the
Seneschal, and Sir Sagramore le Desirous; and Sir Kay required Sir
Tristram to joust, and Sir Tristram in a manner refused him, because he
would not be hurt nor bruised against the great jousts that should be
before the Castle of Maidens, and therefore he thought to repose him and
to rest him.</p>
<p>And alway Sir Kay cried, ‘Sir knight of Cornwall, joust with me, or
else yield thee to me as recreant.’</p>
<p>When Sir Tristram heard him say so he turned to him, and then Sir Kay
refused him and turned his back.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram said, ‘As I find thee I shall take thee.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Kay turned with evil will, and Sir Tristram smote Sir Kay
down, and so he rode forth.</p>
<p>Then Sir Sagramore le Desirous rode after Sir Tristram, and made him
to joust with him, and there Sir Tristram smote down Sir Sagramore le
Desirous from his horse, and rode his way.</p>
<p>And the same day he met with a damosel that told him that he should
win great worship of a knight adventurous that did much harm in all that
country. When Sir Tristram heard her say so, he was glad to go with her
to win worship. So Sir Tristram rode with that damosel a six mile, and
then met him Sir Gawain, and therewithal Sir Gawain knew the damosel,
that she was a damosel of Queen Morgan le Fay. Then Sir Gawain
understood that she led that knight to some mischief.</p>
<p>‘Fair knight,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘whither ride you now with that
damosel?’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I wot not whither I shall ride but as the
damosel will lead me.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘ye shall not ride with her, for she and her
lady did never good, but ill.’ And then Sir Gawain pulled out his sword
and said, ‘Damosel, but if thou tell me anon for what cause thou leadest
this knight with thee thou shalt die for it right anon: I know all your
lady’s treason, and yours.’</p>
<p>‘Mercy, Sir Gawain,’ she said, ‘and if ye will save my life I will
tell you.’</p>
<p>‘Say on,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘and thou shalt have thy life.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ she said, ‘Queen Morgan le Fay, my lady, hath ordained a
thirty ladies to seek and espy after Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram, and
by the trains of these ladies, who that may first meet any of these two
knights, they should turn them unto Morgan le Fay’s castle, saying that
they should do deeds of worship; and if any of those two knights came
there, there be thirty knights lying and watching in a tower to wait
upon Sir Launcelot or upon Sir Tristram.’</p>
<p>‘Fie for shame,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘that ever such false treason
should be wrought or used in a queen, and a king’s sister, and a king
and queen’s daughter.’</p>
<p>pursuivants: heralds.</p>
