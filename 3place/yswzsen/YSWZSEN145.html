<h4 id="chapter-25">Chapter 25</h4>
<p>How the Queen of Orkney came to this feast of Pentecost, and Sir
Gawain and his brethren came to ask her blessing</p>
<p>So then the king and they went to meat, and were served in the best
manner. And as they sat at the meat, there came in the Queen of Orkney,
with ladies and knights a great number. And then Sir Gawain, Sir
Agravain, and Gaheris arose, and went to her and saluted her upon their
knees, and asked her blessing; for in fifteen year they had not seen
her. Then she spake on high to her brother King Arthur:</p>
<p>‘Where have ye done my young son Sir Gareth? He was here amongst you
a twelvemonth, and ye made a kitchen knave of him, the which is shame to
you all. Alas, where have ye done my dear son that was my joy and
bliss?’</p>
<p>‘O dear mother,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘I knew him not.’</p>
<p>‘Nor I,’ said the king, ‘that now me repenteth, but thanked be God he
is proved a worshipful knight as any is now living of his years, and I
shall never be glad till I may find him.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, brother,’ said the queen unto King Arthur, and unto Sir Gawain,
and to all her sons, ‘ye did yourself great shame when ye amongst you
kept my son in the kitchen and fed him like a poor hog.’</p>
<p>‘Fair sister,’ said King Arthur, ‘ye shall right well wit I knew him
not, nor no more did Sir Gawain, nor his brethren; but sithen it is so,’
said the king, ‘that he is thus gone from us all, we must shape a remedy
to find him. Also, sister, meseemeth ye might have done me to wit of his
coming, and then and I had not done well to him ye might have blamed me.
For when he came to this court he came leaning upon two men’s shoulders,
as though he might not have gone. And then he asked me three gifts; and
one he asked the same day, that was that I would give him meat enough
that twelvemonth; and the other two gifts he asked that day a
twelvemonth, and that was that he might have the adventure of the
damosel Lynet, and the third was that Sir Launce-lot should make him
knight when he desired him. And so I granted him all his desire, and
many in this court marvelled that he desired his sustenance for a
twelvemonth. And thereby, we deemed, many of us, that he was not come of
a noble house.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the Queen of Orkney unto King Arthur her brother, ‘wit ye
well that I sent him unto you right well armed and horsed, and
worshipfully beseen of his body, and gold and silver plenty to
spend.’</p>
<p>‘It may be,’ said the King, ‘but thereof saw we none, save that same
day as he departed from us, knights told me that there came a dwarf
hither suddenly, and brought him armour and a good horse full well and
richly beseen; and thereat we all had marvel from whence that riches
came, that we deemed all that he was come of men of worship.’</p>
<p>‘Brother,’ said the queen, ‘all that ye say I believe, for ever
sithen he was grown he was marvellously witted, and ever he was faithful
and true of his promise. But I marvel,’ said she, ‘that Sir Kay did mock
him and scorn him, and gave him that name Beaumains; yet, Sir Kay,’ said
the queen, ‘named him more righteously than he weened; for I dare say
and he be alive, he is as fair an handed man and well disposed as any is
living.’</p>
<p>‘Sister,’ said Arthur, ‘let this language be still, and by the grace
of God he shall be found and he be within this seven realms, and let all
this pass and be merry, for he is proved to be a man of worship, and
that is my joy.’</p>
