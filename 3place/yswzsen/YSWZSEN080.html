<h4 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h4>
<p>How Sir Marhaus jousted with Sir Gawain and Sir Uwain, and overthrew
them both</p>
<p>And then Sir Marhaus rode unto his shield, and saw how it was
defouled, and said, ‘Of this despite I am a part avenged, but for her
love that gave me this white shield I shall wear thee, and hang mine
where thou was;’ and so he hanged it about his neck. Then he rode
straight unto Sir Gawain and to Sir Uwain, and asked them what they did
there. They answered him that they came from King Arthur’s court for to
see adventures.</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Sir Marhaus, ‘here am I ready, an adventurous knight
that will fulfil any adventure that ye will desire;’ and so departed
from them, to fetch his range.</p>
<p>‘Let him go,’ said Sir Uwain unto Sir Gawain, ‘for he is a passing
good knight as any is living; I would not by my will that any of us were
matched with him.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘not so, it were shame to us were he not
assayed, were he never so good a knight.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Sir Uwain, ‘I will assay him afore you, for I am more
weaker than ye, and if he smite me down then may ye revenge me.’</p>
<p>So these two knights came together with great raundon, that Sir Uwain
smote Sir Marhaus that his spear brast in pieces on the shield, and Sir
Marhaus smote him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth, and
hurt Sir Uwain on the left side. Then Sir Marhaus turned his horse and
rode toward Gawain with his spear, and when Sir Gawain saw that, he
dressed his shield, and they aventred their spears, and they came
together with all the might of their horses, that either knight smote
other so hard in midst of their shields, but Sir Gawain’s spear brake,
but Sir Marhaus’ spear held; and therewith Sir Gawain and his horse
rushed down to the earth.</p>
<p>And lightly Sir Gawain rose on his feet, and pulled out his sword,
and dressed him toward Sir Marhaus on foot, and Sir Marhaus saw that,
and pulled out his sword and began to come to Sir Gawain on
horseback.</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘alight on foot, or else I will slay
thy horse.’</p>
<p>‘Gramercy,’ said Sir Marhaus, ‘of your gentleness ye teach me
courtesy, for it is not for one knight to be on foot, and the other on
horseback.’</p>
<p>And therewith Sir Marhaus set his spear against a tree and alit and
tied his horse to a tree, and dressed his shield, and. either came unto
other eagerly, and smote together with their swords that their shields
flew in cantels, and they bruised their helms and their hauberks, and
wounded either other.</p>
<p>But Sir Gawain from it passed nine of the clock waxed ever stronger
and stronger, for then it came to the hour of noon, and thrice his might
was increased. All this espied Sir Marhaus and had great wonder how his
might increased, and so they wounded other passing sore. And then when
it was past noon, and when it drew toward evensong, Sir Gawain’s
strength feebled, and waxed passing faint that unnethes he might dure
any longer, and Sir Marhaus was then bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ said Sir Marhaus, ‘I have well felt that ye are a
passing good knight and a marvellous man of might as ever I felt any,
while it lasteth, and our quarrels are not great, and therefore it were
pity to do you hurt, for I feel ye are passing feeble.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘gentle knight, ye say the word that I should
say.’</p>
<p>And therewith they took off their helms, and either kissed other, and
there they swore together either to love other as brethren. And Sir
Marhaus prayed Sir Gawain to lodge with him that night. And so they took
their horses, and rode toward Sir Marhaus’ house.</p>
<p>And as they rode by the way, ‘Sir knight,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘I have
marvel that so valiant a man as ye be love no ladies ne damosels.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Marhaus, ‘they name me wrongfully those that give me
that name, but well I wot it be the damosels of the turret that so name
me, and other such as they be. Now shall I tell you for what cause I
hate them: for they be sorceresses and enchanters many of them, and be a
knight never so good of his body and full of prowess as man may be, they
will make him a stark coward to have the better of him, and this is the
principal cause that I hate them. And to all good ladies and gentlewomen
I owe my service as a knight ought to do.’</p>
<p>As the book rehearseth in French, there were many knights that
overmatched Sir Gawain, for all the thrice might that he had: Sir
Launcelot de Lake, Sir Tristram, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Percival, Sir
Pelleas, and Sir Marhaus, these six knights had the better of Sir
Gawain.</p>
<p>Then within a little while they came to Sir Marhaus’ place, which was
in a little priory, and there they alit, and ladies and damosels unarmed
them, and hastily looked to their hurts, for they were all three hurt.
And so they had all three good lodging with Sir Marhaus, and good cheer,
for when he wist that they were King Arthur’s sister’s sons he made them
all the cheer that lay in his power, and so they sojourned there a
seven-night, and were well eased of their wounds, and at the last
departed.</p>
<p>‘Now,’ said Sir Marhaus, ‘we will not depart so lightly, for I will
bring you through the forest;’ and rode day by day well a seven days or
they found any adventure.</p>
<p>At the last they came into a great forest, that was named the country
and forest of Arroy, and the country of strange adventures.</p>
<p>‘In this country,’ said Sir Marhaus, ‘came never knight since it was
christened, but he found strange adventures.’</p>
<p>And so they rode, and came into a deep valley full of stones, and
thereby they saw a fair stream of water; above thereby was the head of
the stream a fair fountain, and three damosels sitting thereby. And then
they rode to them, and either saluted other, and the eldest had a
garland of gold about her head, and she was three score winter of age or
more, and her hair was white under the garland. The second damosel was
of thirty winter of age, with a circlet of gold about her head. The
third damosel was but fifteen year of age, and a garland of flowers
about her head. When these knights had so beheld them, they asked them
the cause why they sat at that fountain.</p>
<p>‘We be here,’ said the damosels, ‘for this cause: if we may see any
errant knights, to teach them unto strange adventures; and ye be three
knights that seeken adventures, and we be three damosels and therefore
each one of you must choose one of us; and when ye have done so we will
lead you unto three highways, and there each of you shall choose a way
and his damosel with him. And this day twelvemonth ye must meet here
again, and God send you your lives, and thereto ye must plight your
troth.’</p>
<p>‘This is well said,’ said Sir Marhaus.</p>
<p>bruised: shattered.</p>
