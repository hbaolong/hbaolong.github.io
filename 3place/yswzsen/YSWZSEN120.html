<h4 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h4>
<p>How Sir Launcelot came to King Arthur’s court, and how there were
recounted all his noble feats and acts</p>
<p>Now turn we unto Sir Launcelot du Lake, that came home two days afore
the feast of Pentecost; and the king and all the court were passing fain
of his coming. And when Sir Gawain, Sir Uwain, Sir Sagramore, Sir Ector
de Maris, saw Sir Launcelot in Kay’s armour, then they wist well it was
he that smote them down all with one spear. Then there was laughing and
smiling among them. And ever now and now came all the knights home that
Sir Turquin had prisoners, and they all honoured and worshipped Sir
Launcelot.</p>
<p>When Sir Gaheris heard them speak, he said, ‘I saw all the battle
from the beginning to the ending,’ and there he told King Arthur all how
it was, and how Sir Turquin was the strongest knight that ever he saw
except Sir Launcelot; there were many knights bare him record, nigh
three score.</p>
<p>Then Sir Kay told the king how Sir Launcelot had rescued him when he
should have been slain, and how ‘he made the knights yield them to me,
and not to him.’ And there they were all three, and bare record. ‘And by
Jesu.’ said Sir Kay, ‘because Sir Launcelot took my harness and left me
his I rode in good peace, and no man would have ado with me.’</p>
<p>Anon therewithal there came the three knights that fought with Sir
Launcelot at the long bridge. And there they yielded them unto Sir Kay,
and Sir Kay forsook them and said he fought never with them. ‘But I
shall ease your heart,’ said Sir Kay, ‘yonder is Sir Launcelot that
overcame you.’ When they wist that they were glad.</p>
<p>And then Sir Meliot de Logris came home, and told the king how Sir
Launcelot had saved him from the death.</p>
<p>And all his deeds were known, how four queens, sorceresses, had him
in prison, and how he was delivered by King Bagdemagus’ daughter. Also
there were told all the great deeds of arms that Sir Launcelot did
betwixt the two kings, that is for to say the King of Northgales and
King Bagdemagus. All the truth Sir Gahalantine did tell, and Sir Mador
de la Porte and Sir Mordred, for they were at that same tournament.</p>
<p>Then came in the lady that knew Sir Launcelot when that he wounded
Sir Belleus at the pavilion. And there, at request of Sir Launcelot, Sir
Belleus was made knight of the Round Table.</p>
<p>And so at that time Sir Launcelot had the greatest name of any knight
of the world, and most he was honoured of high and low.</p>
<p>Explicit the noble tale of Sir Launcelot du Lake, which is the</p>
<ol start="6" type="i">
<li>book. Here followeth the tale of Sir Gareth of</li>
</ol>
<p>Orkney that was called Beaumains by Sir</p>
<p>Kay, and is the seventh book</p>
