<h4 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h4>
<p>How Beaumains departed, and how he gat of Sir Kay a spear and a
shield, and how he jousted and fought with Sir Launcelot</p>
<p>But there went many after to behold how well he was horsed and
trapped in cloth of gold, but he had neither shield nor spear.</p>
<p>Then Sir Kay said all open in the hall, ‘I will ride after my boy in
the kitchen, to wit whether he will know me for his better.’</p>
<p>Said Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawain, ‘Yet abide at home.’</p>
<p>So Sir Kay made him ready and took his horse and his spear, and rode
after him. And right as Beaumains overtook the damosel, right so came
Sir Kay and said, ‘Beaumains, what, sir, know ye not me?’</p>
<p>Then he turned his horse, and knew it was Sir Kay, that had done him
all the despite as ye have heard afore.</p>
<p>‘Yea,’ said Beaumains, ‘I know you for an ungentle knight of the
court, and therefore beware of me.’</p>
<p>Therewith Sir Kay put his spear in the rest, and ran straight upon
him; and Beaumains came as fast upon him with his sword in his hand, and
so he put away his spear with his sword, and with a foin thrusted him
through the side, that Sir Kay fell down as he had been dead; and he
alit down and took Sir Kay’s shield and his spear, and start upon his
own horse and rode his way.</p>
<p>All that saw Sir Launcelot, and so did the damosel. And then he bad
his dwarf start upon Sir Kay’s horse, and so he did. By that Sir
Launcelot was come, then he proffered Sir Launcelot to joust; and either
made them ready, and they came together so fiercely that either bare
down other to the earth, and sore were they bruised. Then Sir Launcelot
arose and halp him from his horse. And then Beaumains threw his shield
from him, and proffered to fight with Sir Launcelot on foot: and so they
rashed together like boars, tracing, rasing, and foining to the
mountenance of an hour; and Sir Launcelot felt him so big that he
marvelled of his strength, for he fought more liker a giant than a
knight, and that his fighting was durable and passing perilous. For Sir
Launcelot had so much ado with him that he dread himself to be shamed,
and said, ‘Beaumains, fight not so sore, your quarrel and mine is not so
great but we may leave off.’</p>
<p>‘Truly that is truth,’ said Beaumains, ‘but it doth me good to feel
your might, and yet, my lord, I showed not the utterance.’</p>
<p>foin: thrust.</p>
