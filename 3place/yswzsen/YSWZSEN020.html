<h4 id="chapter-19">Chapter 19</h4>
<p>How King Arthur rode to Caerleon, and of his dream, and how he saw
the Questing Beast</p>
<p>Then after the departing of King Ban and of King Bors, King Arthur
rode unto Caerleon. And thither came to him King Lot’s wife, of Orkney,
in manner of a message, but she was sent thither to espy the court of
King Arthur; and she came richly beseen, with her four sons Gawain,
Gaheris, Agravain, and Gareth, with many other knights and ladies. For
she was a passing fair lady, wherefor the king cast great love unto her,
and desired to lie by her. So they were agreed, and he begat upon her
Mordred, and she was his sister, on the mother side, Igraine. So there
she rested her a month, and at the last departed.</p>
<p>Then the king dreamed a marvellous dream whereof he was sore adread.
But all this time King Arthur knew not that King Lot’s wife was his
sister. Thus was the dream of Arthur:</p>
<p>Him thought there was come into this land griffins and serpents, and
him thought they burnt and slew all the people in the land, and then him
thought he fought with them, and they did him passing great harm, and
wounded him full sore, but at the last he slew them.</p>
<p>When the king awaked, he was passing heavy of his dream, and so to
put it out of thoughts, he made him ready with many knights to ride on
hunting. As soon as he was in the forest the king saw a great hart afore
him.</p>
<p>‘This hart will I chase,’ said King Arthur, and so he spurred the
horse, and rode after long, and so by fine force oft he was like to have
smitten the hart; whereas the king had chased the hart so long, that his
horse had lost his breath, and fell down dead; then a yeoman fetched the
king another horse. So the king saw the hart ambushed, and his horse
dead; he set him down by a fountain, and there he fell in great
thoughts.</p>
<p>And as he sat so, him thought he heard a noise of hounds, to the sum
of thirty. And with that the king saw coming toward him the strangest
beast that ever he saw or heard of. So the beast went to the well and
drank, and the noise was in the beast’s belly like unto the questing of
thirty couple hounds; but all the while the beast drank there was no
noise in the beast’s belly; and therewith the beast departed with a
great noise, whereof the king had great marvel. And so he was in a great
thought, and therewith he fell asleep.</p>
<p>Right so there came a knight afoot unto Arthur and said, ‘Knight full
of thought and sleepy, tell me if thou sawest a strange beast pass this
way.’</p>
<p>‘Such one saw I,’ said King Arthur, ‘that is past two mile; what
would ye with the beast?’ said Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Sir, I have followed that beast long time, and killed mine horse, so
would God I had another to follow my quest.’</p>
<p>Right so came one with the king’s horse, and when the knight saw the
horse, he prayed the king to give him the horse: ‘for I have followed
this quest this twelvemonth, and either I shall achieve him, or bleed of
the best blood of my body.’</p>
<p>Pellinor, that time king, followed the Questing Beast, and after his
death Sir Palomides followed it.</p>
<p>pretendeth: pertains.</p>
