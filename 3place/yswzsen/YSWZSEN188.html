<h4 id="chapter-33">Chapter 33</h4>
<p>How Sir Lamorak jousted with thirty knights, and Sir Tristram at the
request of King Mark smote his horse down</p>
<p>The king and the queen made their pavilions and their tents in that
forest beside a river, and there was daily hunting and jousting, for
there were ever thirty knights ready to joust unto all them that came in
at that time. And there by fortune came Sir Lamorak de Gales and Sir
Driant; and there Sir Driant jousted right well, but at the last he had
a fall. Then Sir Lamorak proffered to joust. And when he began he fared
so with the thirty knights that there was not one of them but that he
gave him a fall, and some of them were sore hurt.</p>
<p>‘I marvel,’ said King Mark, ‘what knight he is that doth such deeds
of arms.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I know him well for a noble knight as few
now be living, and his name is Sir Lamorak de Gales.’</p>
<p>‘It were great shame,’ said the king, ‘that he should go thus away,
unless that some of you meet with him better.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘meseemeth it were no worship for a noble
man to have ado with him; and for because at this time he hath done over
much for any mean knight living, therefore, as meseemeth, it were great
shame and villainy to tempt him any more at this time, insomuch as he
and his horse are weary both; for the deeds of arms that he hath done
this day, and they be well considered, it were enough for Sir Launcelot
du Lake.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said King Mark, ‘I require you, as ye love me and my
lady the queen, La Beale Isoud, take your arms and joust with Sir
Lamorak de Gales.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘ye bid me do a thing that is against
knighthood, and well I can deem that I shall give him a fall, for it is
no mastery, for my horse and I be fresh both, and so is not his horse
and he; and wit ye well that he will take it for great unkindness, for
ever one good is loth to take another at disadvantage; but because I
will not displease you, as ye require me so will I do, and obey your
commandment.’</p>
<p>And so Sir Tristram armed him and took his horse, and put him forth,
and there Sir Lamorak met him mightily, and what with the might of his
own spear, and of Sir Tristram’s spear, Sir Lamorak’s horse fell to the
earth, and he sitting in the saddle. Then anon as lightly as he might he
avoided the saddle and his horse, and put his shield afore him and drew
his sword.</p>
<p>And then he bad Sir Tristram: ‘Alight, thou knight, and thou
darst.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I will no more have ado with thee, for I
have done to thee over much unto my dishonour and to thy worship.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘I can thee no thank; since thou
hast for-jousted me on horseback I require thee and I beseech thee, and
thou be Sir Tristram, fight with me on foot.’</p>
<p>‘I will not so,’ said Sir Tristram; ‘and wit ye well my name is Sir
Tristram de Liones, and well I know ye be Sir Lamorak de Gales, and this
that I have done to you was against my will, but I was required thereto.
But to say that I will do at your request as at this time, I will have
no more ado with you, for me shameth of that I have done.’</p>
<p>‘As for the shame,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘on thy part or on mine, bear
thou it and thou wilt, for though a mare’s son hath failed me, now a
queen’s son shall not fail thee; and therefore, and thou be such a
knight as men call thee, I require thee, alight, and fight with me.’</p>
<p>‘Sir Lamorak,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I understand your heart is great,
and cause why ye have, to say thee sooth; for it would grieve me and any
knight should keep him fresh and then to strike down a weary knight, for
that knight nor horse was never formed that alway might stand or endure.
And therefore,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I will not have ado with you, for me
forthinketh of that I have done.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘I shall quit you and ever I see my
time.’</p>
