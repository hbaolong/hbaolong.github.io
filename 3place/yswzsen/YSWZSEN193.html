<h4 id="chapter-38">Chapter 38</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram and his wife arrived in Wales, and how he met there
with Sir Lamorak</p>
<p>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram, that upon a day he took a little
barget, and his wife Isoud la Blanche Mains, with Sir Kehydius her
brother, to play them in the coasts. And when they were from the land,
there was a wind drove them in to the coast of Wales upon this Isle of
Servage, whereas was Sir Lamorak, and there the barget all to-rove; and
there Dame Isoud was hurt. And as well as they might they gat into the
forest, and there by a well he saw Segwarides and a damosel. And then
either saluted other.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Segwarides, ‘I know you for Sir Tristram de Liones, the
man in the world that I have most cause to hate, because ye departed the
love between me and my wife; but as for that,’ said Segwarides, ‘I will
never hate a noble knight for a light lady; and therefore, I pray you,
be my friend, and I will be yours unto my power; for wit ye well ye are
hard bestad in this valley, and we shall have enough to do either of us
to succour other.’</p>
<p>And then Sir Segwarides brought Sir Tristram to a lady there by that
was born in Cornwall, and she told him all the perils of that valley,
and how there came never knight there but he were taken prisoner or
slain.</p>
<p>‘Wit you well, fair lady,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘that I slew Sir
Marhaus and delivered Cornwall from the truage of Ireland, and I am he
that delivered the King of Ireland from Sir Blamor de Ganis, and I am he
that beat Sir Palomides; and wit ye well I am Sir Tristram de Liones,
that by the grace of God shall deliver this woful Isle of Servage.’</p>
<p>So Sir Tristram was well eased. Then one told him there was a knight
of King Arthur’s that had wrecked on the rocks.</p>
<p>‘What is his name?’ said Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>‘We wot not,’ said the fishers, ‘but he keepeth it no counsel but
that he is a knight of King Arthur, and by the mighty lord of this isle
he setteth nought by.’</p>
<p>‘I pray you,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘and ye may, bring him hither that I
may see him, and if he be any of the knights of Arthur’s I shall know
him.’</p>
<p>Then the lady prayed the fishers to bring him to her place. So on the
morrow they brought him thither in a fisher’s raiment; and as soon as
Sir Tristram saw him he smiled upon him and knew him well, but he knew
not Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>‘Fair sir,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘meseemeth by your cheer ye have been
diseased but late and also methinketh I should know you heretofore.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘that ye have seen me and met with
me.’</p>
<p>‘Fair sir,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘tell me your name.’</p>
<p>‘Upon a covenant I will tell you,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘that is, that
ye will tell me whether ye be lord of this island or no, that is called
Nabon le Noire.’</p>
<p>‘Forsooth,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I am not he, nor I hold not of him; I
am his foe as well as ye be, and so shall I be found or I depart out of
this isle.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘since ye have said so largely unto me, my
name is Sir Lamorak de Gales, son unto King Pellinor.’</p>
<p>‘Forsooth,’ I trow well,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘for and ye said other I
know the contrary.’</p>
<p>‘What are ye,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘that knoweth me?’</p>
<p>‘I am Sir Tristram de Liones.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, sir, remember ye not of the fall ye did give me once, and after
ye refused me to fight on foot.’</p>
<p>‘That was not for fear I had of you,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘but me
shamed at that time to have more ado with you, for meseemed ye had
enough; but, Sir Lamorak, for my kindness many ladies ye put to a
reproof when ye sent the horn from Morgan le Fay to King Mark, whereas
ye did this in despite of me.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said he, ‘and it were to do again, so would I do, for I had
lever strife and debate fell in King Mark’s court rather than Arthur’s
court, for the honour of both courts be not alike.’</p>
<p>‘As to that,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I know well; but that that was done
it was for despite of me, but all your malice, I thank God, hurt not
greatly. Therefore,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘ye shall leave all your malice,
and so will I, and let us assay how we may win worship between you and
me upon this giant, Sir Nabon le Noire that is lord of this island, to
destroy him.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘now I understand your knighthood, it may
not be false that all men say, for of your bounty, noblesse, and
worship, of all knights ye are peerless, and for your courtesy and
gentleness I showed you ungentleness, and that now me repenteth.’</p>
