<h4 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h4>
<p>How Sir Marhaus after that he was arrived in Ireland died of the
stroke that Sir Tristram had given to him, and how Tristram was hurt</p>
<p>Anon Sir Marhaus and his fellowship departed into Ireland. And as
soon as he came to the king, his brother, he let search his wounds. And
when his head was searched a piece of Sir Tristram’s sword was founden
therein, and might never be had out of his head for no surgeons, and so
he died of Sir Tristram’s sword; and that piece of the sword the queen,
his sister, kept it for ever with her, for she thought to be revenged
and she might.</p>
<p>Now turn we again unto Sir Tristram, that was sore wounded, and full
sore bled that he might not within a little while, when he had taken
cold, unnethe stir him of his limbs. And then he set him down softly
upon a little hill, and bled fast. Then anon came Gouvernail, his man,
with his vessel; and the king and his barons came with procession
against him.</p>
<p>And when he was come unto the land, King Mark took him in his arms,
and the king and Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, led Sir Tristram into the
Castle of Tintagel. And then was he searched in the best manner, and
laid in his bed. And when King Mark saw his wounds he wept heartily and
so did all his lords.</p>
<p>‘So God me help,’ said King Mark, ‘I would not for all my lands that
my nephew died.’</p>
<p>So Sir Tristram lay there a month and more, and ever he was like to
die of that stroke that Sir Marhaus smote him first with the spear. For,
as the French book saith, the spear’s head was envenomed, that Sir
Tristram might not be whole. Then was King Mark and all his barons
passing heavy, for they deemed none other but that Sir Tristram should
not recover. Then the king let send after all manner of leeches and
surgeons, both unto men and women, and there was none that would behote
him the life.</p>
<p>Then came there a lady that was a right wise lady, and she said
plainly unto King Mark, and to Sir Tristram, and to all his barons, that
he should never be whole but if Sir Tristram went in the same country
that the venom came from, and in that country should he be holpen or
else never. Thus said the lady unto the king. When King Mark understood
that, he let purvey for Sir Tristram a fair vessel, well victualled, and
therein was put Sir Tristram, and Gouvernail with him, and Sir Tristram
took his harp with him, and so he was put into the sea to sail into
Ireland.</p>
<p>And so by good fortune he arrived up in Ireland, even fast by a
castle where the king and the queen was; and at his arrival he sat and
harped in his bed a merry lay, such one heard they never none in Ireland
afore that time. And when it was told the king and the queen of such a
knight that was such an harper, anon the king sent for him, and let
search his wounds, and then asked him his name.</p>
<p>Then he answered, ‘I am of the country of Liones, and my name is
Tramtrist, that thus was wounded in a battle as I fought for a lady’s
right.’</p>
<p>‘So God me help,’ said King Agwisance, ‘ye shall have all the help in
this land that ye may have here. But I let you wit, in Cornwall I had a
great loss as ever had king, for there I lost the best knight of the
world; his name was Marhaus, a full noble knight, and knight of the
Table Round;’ and there he told Sir Tristram wherefore Sir Marhaus was
slain. Sir Tristram made semblant as he had been sorry, and better knew
he how it was than the king.</p>
