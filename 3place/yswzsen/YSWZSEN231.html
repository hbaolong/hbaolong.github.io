<h4 id="chapter-35">Chapter 35</h4>
<p>How Palomides came to the castle where Sir Tristram was, and of the
quest that Sir Launcelot and ten knights made for Sir Tristram</p>
<p>And when he came to the land he took off his harness, and sat roaring
and crying as a man out of his mind. Right so came a damosel even by Sir
Palomides, that was sent from Sir Gawain and his brother unto Sir
Mordred, that lay sick in the same place with that old knight where Sir
Tristram was. For, as the French book saith, Sir Persides hurt so Sir
Mordred a ten days afore; and had not been for the love of Sir Gawain
and his brother, Sir Persides had slain Sir Mordred. And so this damosel
came by Sir Palomides, and she and he had language together, the which
pleased neither of them; and so the damosel rode her ways till she came
to the old knight’s place, and there she told that old knight how she
met with the woodest knight by adventure that ever she met withal.</p>
<p>‘What bare he in his shield?’ said Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>‘It was indented with white and black,’ said the damosel.</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘that was Sir Palomides, the good knight.
For well I know him,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘for one of the best knights
living in this realm.’</p>
<p>Then that old knight took a little hackney, and rode for Sir
Palomides, and brought him unto his own manor; and full well knew Sir
Tristram Sir Palomides, but he said but little, for at that time Sir
Tristram was walking upon his feet, and well amended of his hurts; and
always when Sir Palomides saw Sir Tristram he would behold him full
marvellously, and ever him seemed that he had seen him.</p>
<p>Then would he say unto Sir Dinadan, ‘And ever I may meet with Sir
Tristram he shall not escape mine hands.’</p>
<p>‘I marvel,’ said Sir Dinadan, ‘that ye boast behind Sir Tristram, for
it is but late that he was in your hands, and ye in his hands. Why would
ye not hold him when ye had him? For I saw myself twice or thrice that
ye gat but little worship of Sir Tristram.’</p>
<p>Then was Sir Palomides ashamed. So leave we them a little while in
the old castle with the old knight Sir Darras.</p>
<p>Now shall we speak of King Arthur, that said to Sir Launcelot, ‘Had
not ye been we had not lost Sir Tristram, for he was here daily unto the
time ye met with him, and in an evil time,’ said Arthur, ‘ye encountered
with him.’</p>
<p>‘My lord Arthur,’ said Launcelot, ‘ye put upon me that I should be
cause of his departition; God knoweth it was against my will. But when
men be hot in deeds of arms oft they hurt their friends as well as their
foes. And my lord,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘ye shall understand that Sir
Tristram is a man that I am loth to offend, for he hath done for me more
than ever I did for him as yet.’</p>
<p>But then Sir Launcelot made bring forth a book; and then Sir
Launcelot said, ‘Here we are ten knights that will swear upon a book
never to rest one night where we rest another this twelvemonth until
that we find Sir Tristram. And as for me,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘I
promise you upon this book that and I may meet with him, other with
fairness or foulness I shall bring him to this court, or else I shall
die therefore.’</p>
<p>And the names of these ten knights that had undertake this quest were
these following: First was Sir Launcelot, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors
de Ganis, and Bleoberis, and Sir Blamor de Ganis, and Lucan the Butler,
Sir Uwain, Sir Galihud, Lionel, and Galihodin.</p>
<p>So these ten noble knights departed from the court of King Arthur,
and so they rode upon their quest together until they came to a cross
where departed four ways, and there departed the fellowship in four to
seek Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>And as Sir Launcelot rode by adventure he met with Dame Bragwaine
that was sent into that country to seek Sir Tristram, and she fled as
fast as her palfrey might go. So Sir Launcelot met with her and asked
her why she fled.</p>
<p>‘Ah, fair knight,’ said Dame Bragwaine, ‘I flee for dread of my life,
for here followeth me Sir Breunis Saunce Pité to slay me.’</p>
<p>‘Hold you nigh me,’ said Sir Launcelot.</p>
<p>Then when Sir Launcelot saw Sir Breunis Saunce Pité, Sir Launcelot
cried unto him, and said, ‘False knight, destroyer of ladies and
damosels, now thy last days be come!’</p>
<p>When Sir Breunis Saunce Pité saw Sir Launcelot’s shield he knew it
well, for at that time he bare not the arms of Cornwall, but he bare his
own shield. And then Sir Breunis fled, and Sir Launcelot1 followed after
him. But Sir Breunis was so well horsed that when him list to flee he
might well flee, and also abide when him list.</p>
<p>And then Sir Launcelot returned unto Dame Bragwaine, and she thanked
him of his great labour.</p>
