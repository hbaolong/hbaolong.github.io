<h4 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h4>
<p>Yet of the same battle</p>
<p>Then Lucan saw King Agwisance, that late had slain Moris de la
Roche,1 and Lucan ran to him with a short spear that was great, that he
gave him such a fall, that the horse fell down to the earth. Also Lucan
found there on foot Bellias of Flanders and Sir Gwinas, two hardy
knights, and in that woodness that Lucan was in, he slew two bachelors
and horsed them again. Then waxed the battle passing hard on both
parties, but Arthur was glad that his knights were horsed again, and
then they fought together, that the noise and sound rang by the water
and the wood. Wherefore King Ban and King Bors made them ready and
dressed their shields and harness, and they were so courageous that many
knights shook and bevered for eagerness.</p>
<p>All this while Lucan, and Gwinas, and Brian, and Bellias of Flanders,
held strong medley against six kings, that was King Lot, King Nentres,
King Brandegoris, King Idres, King Uriens, and King Agwisance. So with
the help of Sir Kay and of Sir Griflet they held these six kings hard,
that unnethe they had any power to defend them. But when Sir Arthur saw
the battle would not be ended by no manner, he fared wood as a lion, and
steered his horse here and there, on the right hand, and on the left
hand, that he stint not till he had slain twenty knights. Also he
wounded King Lot sore on the shoulder and made him to leave that ground,
for Sir Kay and Griflet did with King Arthur there great deeds of
arms.</p>
<p>Then Ulfius, and Brastias, and Sir Ector encountered against the Duke
Eustace, and King Cradelment, and King Clarivaus of Northumberland, and
King Carados, and against the King with the Hundred Knights. So these
knights encountered with these kings, that they made them to avoid the
ground. Then King Lot made great dole for his damages and his fellows,
and said unto the ten kings, ‘But if ye will do as I devise we shall be
slain and destroyed. Let me have the King with the Hundred Knights, and
King Agwisance, and King Idres, and the Duke of Cambenet, and we five
kings will have fifteen thousand men of arms with us, and we will go
apart while ye six kings hold medley with twelve thousand; and we see
that ye have foughten with them long, then will we come on fiercely, and
else shall we never match them,’ said King Lot, ‘but by this mean.’ So
they departed as they here devised, and six kings made their party
strong against Arthur, and made great war long.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile brake the ambushment of King Ban and King Bors, and
Lionses and Phariance had the avant-guard, and they two knights met with
King Idres and his fellowship, and there began a great medley of
breaking of spears, and smiting of swords, with slaying of men and
horses, and King Idres was near at discomfiture. That saw Agwisance the
king, and put Lionses and Phariance in point of death; for the Duke of
Cambenet came on withal with a great fellowship, so these two knights
were in great danger of their lives that they were fain to return, but
always they rescued themselves and their fellowship marvellously. When
King Bors saw those knights put aback, it grieved him sore; then he came
on so fast that his fellowship seemed as black as Inde.</p>
<p>When King Lot had espied King Bors, he knew him well, then he said,
‘O Jehu, defend us from death and horrible maims! For I see well we be
in great peril of death; for I see yonder a king, one of the most
worshipfullest men, and the best knights2 of the world be inclined unto
his fellowship.’</p>
<p>‘What is he?’ said the King with the Hundred Knights.</p>
<p>‘It is,’ said King Lot, ‘King Bors of Gaul; I marvel how they come
into this country without witting of us all.’</p>
<p>‘It was by Merlin’s advice,’ said the knight.</p>
<p>‘As for him,’ said King Carados, ‘I will encounter with King Bors,
and ye will rescue me when mister is.’</p>
<p>‘Go on,’ said they all, ‘we will do all that we may.’</p>
<p>Then King Carados and his host rode on a soft pace, till that they
come as nigh King Bors as bow-draught, then either battle let their
horse run as fast as they might. And Bleoberis3 that was godson unto
King Bors he bare his chief standard, that was a passing good
knight.</p>
<p>‘Now shall we see,’ said King Bors, ‘how these northern Britons can
bear the arms;’ and King Bors encountered with a knight, and smote him
throughout with a spear that he fell dead unto the earth, and after drew
hiss word and did marvellous deeds of arms, that all parties had great
wonder thereof. And his knights failed not, but did their part, and King
Carados was smitten to the earth. With that came the King with the
Hundred Knights and rescued King Carados mightily by force of arms, for
he was, a passing good knight of a king, and but a young man.</p>
<p>woodness: madness. bevered: trembled. eagerness: fierceness.</p>
<p>unnethe: scarcely. fared: behaved. avoid: leave.</p>
