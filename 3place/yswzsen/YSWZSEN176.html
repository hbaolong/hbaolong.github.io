<h4 id="chapter-21">Chapter 21</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram rescued a shield from a knight, and how Gouvernail
told him of King Agwisance</p>
<p>The knight turned his horse and he made him ready to fight. And then
Sir Tristram smote him with a sword such a buffet that he tumbled to the
earth. And then he yielded him unto Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>‘Then come thy way,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘and bring the shield to the
lady again.’</p>
<p>So he took his horse weakly and rode with Sir Tristram; and then by
the way Sir Tristram asked him his name.</p>
<p>Then he said, ‘My name is Breunis Saunce Pité.’</p>
<p>So when he had delivered that shield to the lady, he said, ‘Sir, as
in this the shield is well remedied.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram let him go again that sore repented him after, for
he was a great foe unto many good knights of King Arthur’s court.</p>
<p>Then when Sir Tristram was in his pavilion, Gouvernail, his man, came
and told him how that King Agwisance of Ireland was come thither, and he
was put in great distress; and there Gouvernail told Sir Tristram how
King Agwisance was summoned and appeled of murder.</p>
<p>‘So God me help,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘these be the best tidings that
ever came to me this seven year, for now shall the King of Ireland have
need of my help; for I daresay there is no knight in this country that
is not of Arthur’s court dare do battle with Sir Blamor de Ganis; and
for to win the love of the King of Ireland I will take the battle upon
me; and therefore Gouvernail bring me, I charge thee, to the king.’</p>
<p>Then Gouvernail went unto King Agwisance of Ireland, and saluted him
fair. The king welcomed him and asked him what he would.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Gouvernail, ‘here is a knight near hand that desireth to
speak with you: he bad me say he would do you service.’</p>
<p>‘What knight is he?’ said the king.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ he said, ‘it is Sir Tristram de Liones, that for your good
grace that ye showed him in your lands will reward you in these
countries.’</p>
<p>‘Come on, fellow,’ said the king, ‘with me anon and show me unto Sir
Tristram.’</p>
<p>So the king took a little hackney and but few fellowship with him,
until he came unto Sir Tristram’s pavilion. And when Sir Tristram saw
the king he ran unto him and would have holden his stirrup. But the king
leapt from his horse lightly, and either halsed other in arms.</p>
<p>‘My gracious lord,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘gramercy of your great
goodnesses showed unto me in your marches and lands: and at that time I
promised you to do my service and ever it lay in my power.’</p>
<p>‘And, gentle knight,’ said the king unto Sir Tristram, ‘now have I
great need of you, never had I so great need of no knight’s help.’</p>
<p>‘How so, my good lord?’ said Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>‘I shall tell you,’ said the king: ‘I am as summoned and appeled from
my country for the death of a knight that was kin unto the good knight
Sir Launcelot; wherefore Sir Blamor de Ganis, brother to Sir Bleoberis
hath appeled me to fight with him, other to find a knight in my stead.
And well I wot,’ said the king, ‘these that are come of King Ban’s
blood, as Sir Launcelot and these other, are passing good knights, and
hard men for to win in battle as any that I know now living.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘for the good lordship ye showed me in
Ireland, and for my lady your daughter’s sake, La Beale Isoud, I will
take the battle for you upon this condition that ye shall grant me two
things: that one is that ye shall swear to me that ye are in the right,
that ye were never consenting to the knight’s death. Sir, then,’ said
Sir Tristram, ‘when that I have done this battle, if God give me grace
that I speed, that ye shall give me a reward, what thing reasonable that
I will ask of you.’</p>
<p>‘So God me help,’ said the king, ‘ye shall have whatsomever ye will
ask.’</p>
<p>‘It is well said,’ said Sir Tristram.</p>
