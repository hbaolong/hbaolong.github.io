<h4 id="chapter-37">Chapter 37</h4>
<p>How King Mark was sorry for the good renown of Sir Tristram. Some of
Arthur’s knights jousted with knights of Cornwall</p>
<p>Now will we speak, and leave Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir
Dinadan in prison, and speak we of other knights that sought after Sir
Tristram many divers parts of this land.</p>
<p>And some yede into Cornwall; and by adventure Sir Gaheris, nephew
unto King Arthur, came unto King Mark, and there he was well received
and sat at King Mark’s own table and ate of his own mess. Then King Mark
asked Sir Gaheris what tidings there were in the realm of Logris.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Gaheris, ‘the king reigneth as a noble knight; and
now but late there was a great jousts and tournament as ever I saw any
in the realm of Logris, and the most noble knights were at that jousts.
But there was one knight that did marvellously three days, and he bare a
black shield, and of all knights that ever I saw he proved the best
knight.’</p>
<p>‘Then,’ said King Mark, ‘that was Sir Launcelot, or Sir Palomides the
paynim.’</p>
<p>‘Not so,’ said Sir Gaheris, ‘for both Sir Launcelot and Sir Palomides
were on the contrary party against the knight with the black
shield.’</p>
<p>‘Then was it Sir Tristram,’ said the king.</p>
<p>‘Yea,’ said Sir Gaheris.</p>
<p>And therewithal the king smote down his head, and in his heart he
feared sore that Sir Tristram should get him such worship in the realm
of Logris wherethrough that he himself should not be able to withstand
him.</p>
<p>Thus Sir Gaheris had great cheer with King Mark, and with Queen La
Beale Isoud, the which was glad of Sir Gaheris’ words; for well she wist
by his deeds and manners that it was Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>And then the king made a feast royal, and to that feast came Sir
Uwain le Fise de Roi Uriens, and some called him Uwain le Blanchemains.
And this Sir Uwain challenged all the knights of Cornwall. Then was the
king wood wroth that he had no knights to answer him.</p>
<p>Then Sir Andred, nephew unto King Mark, leapt up and said, ‘I will
encounter with Sir Uwain.’ Then he yede and armed him and horsed him in
the best manner. And there Sir Uwain met with Sir Andred, and smote him
down that he swooned on the earth. Then was King Mark sorry and wroth
out of measure that he had no knight to revenge his nephew, Sir Andred.
So the king called unto him Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, and prayed him for
his sake to take upon him to joust with Sir Uwain.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Dinas, ‘I am full loth to have ado with any knight of
the Round Table.’</p>
<p>‘Yet,’ said the King, ‘for my love take upon thee to joust.’</p>
<p>So Sir Dinas made him ready, and anon they encountered together with
great spears, but Sir Dinas was overthrown, horse and man, a great fall.
Who was wroth but King Mark!</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ he said, ‘have I no knight that will encounter with yonder
knight?’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Gaheris, ‘for your sake I will joust.’</p>
<p>So Sir Gaheris made him ready, and when he was armed he rode into the
field. And when Sir Uwain saw Sir Gaheris’ shield he rode to him and
said,</p>
<p>‘Sir, ye do not your part. For sir, the first time ye were made
knight of the Round Table ye sware that ye should not have ado with your
fellowship wittingly. And perdy, Sir Gaheris, ye knew me well enough by
my shield, and so do I know you by your shield, and though ye would
break your oath I would not break mine; for there is not one here nor ye
that shall think I am afeared of you, but I durst right well have ado
with you, and yet we be sister’s sons.’</p>
<p>Then was Sir Gaheris ashamed, and so therewithal every knight went
their way, and Sir Uwain rode into the country.</p>
<p>Then King Mark armed him, and took his horse and his spear, with a
squire with him. And then he rode afore Sir Uwain, and suddenly at a gap
he ran upon him as he that was not ware of him, and there he smote him
almost through the body, and there left him.</p>
<p>So within a while there came Sir Kay and found Sir Uwain, and asked
him how he was hurt.</p>
<p>‘I wot not,’ said Sir Uwain, ‘why nor wherefore, but by treason I am
sure I gat this hurt; for there came a knight suddenly upon me or that I
was ware, and suddenly hurt me.’</p>
<p>Then there was come Sir Andred to seek King Mark.</p>
<p>‘Thou traitor knight,’ said Sir Kay, ‘and I wist it were thou that
thus traitorly hast hurt this noble knight thou shouldst never pass my
hands.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Andred, ‘I did never hurt him, and that I will report
me to himself.’</p>
<p>‘Fie on you false knights,’ said Sir Kay, ‘for ye of Cornwall are
nought worth.’</p>
<p>So Sir Kay made carry Sir Uwain to the Abbey of the Black Cross, and
there he was healed.</p>
<p>And then Sir Gaheris took his leave of King Mark, but or he departed
he said, ‘Sir king, ye did a foul shame unto you and your court, when ye
banished Sir Tristram out of this country, for ye needed not to have
doubted no knight and he had been here.’ And so he departed.</p>
