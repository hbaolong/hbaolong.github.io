<h4 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h4>
<p>How King Arthur was brought into the Forest Perilous, and how Sir
Tristram saved his life</p>
<p>Now shall ye hear what was the cause that King Arthur came into the
Forest Perilous, that was in North Wales, by the means of a lady. Her
name was Annowre, and this lady came to King Arthur at Cardiff; and she
by fair promise and fair behests made King Arthur to ride with her into
that Forest Perilous. And she was a great sorceress; and many days she
had loved King Arthur, and because she would have him to lie by her she
came into that country.</p>
<p>So when the king was gone with her many of his knights followed after
King Arthur when they missed him, as Sir Launcelot, Brandiles, and many
other. And when she had brought him to her tower she desired him to lie
by her; and then the king remembered him of his lady, and would not lie
by her for no craft that she could do. Then every day she would make him
ride into that forest with his own knights, to the intent to have had
King Arthur slain. For when this Lady Annowre saw that she might not
have him at her will, then she laboured by false means to have destroyed
King Arthur, and slain.</p>
<p>Then the Lady of the Lake that was alway friendly to King Arthur, she
understood by her subtle crafts that King Arthur was like to be
destroyed. And therefore this Lady of the Lake that hight Nimue, came
into that forest to seek after Sir Launcelot du Lake or Sir Tristram for
to help King Arthur; foras that same day this Lady of the Lake knew well
that King Arthur should be slain, unless that he had help of one of
these two knights. And thus she rode up and down till she met with Sir
Tristram, and anon as she saw him she knew him.</p>
<p>‘O my lord Sir Tristram,’ she said, ‘well be ye met, and blessed be
the time that I have met with you; for this same day, and within these
two hours, shall be done the foulest deed that ever was done in this
land.’</p>
<p>‘O fair damosel,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘may I amend it?’</p>
<p>‘Come on with me,’ she said, ‘and that in all the haste ye may, for
ye shall see the most worshipfullest knight of the world hard
bestad.’</p>
<p>Then said Sir Tristram, ‘I am ready to help such a noble man.’</p>
<p>‘He is neither better ne worse,’ said the Lady of the Lake, ‘but the
noble King Arthur himself.’</p>
<p>‘God defend,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘that ever he should be in such
distress.’</p>
<p>Then they rode together a great pace, until they came to a little
turret, a castle; and underneath that castle they saw a knight standing
upon foot fighting with two knights; and so Sir Tristram beheld them,
and at the last the two knights smote down the one knight, and that one
of them unlaced his helm to have slain him. And the Lady Annowre gat
King Arthur’s sword in her hand to have stricken off his head.</p>
<p>And therewithal came Sir Tristram with all his might, crying,
‘Traitress, traitress, leave that!’ And anon there Sir Tristram smote
the one of the knights through the body that he fell dead; and then he
rashed to the other and smote his back in sunder.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile the Lady of the Lake cried to King Arthur, ‘Let
not that false lady escape.’</p>
<p>Then King Arthur overtook her, and with the same sword he smote off
her head, and the Lady of the Lake took up her head and hung it up by
the hair off her saddle-bow.</p>
<p>And then Sir Tristram horsed King Arthur and rode forth with him, but
he charged the Lady of the Lake not to discover his name as at that
time. When the king was horsed he thanked heartily Sir Tristram, and
desired to wit his name; but he would not tell him, but that he was a
poor knight adventurous; and so he bare King Arthur fellowship till he
met with some of his knights.</p>
<p>And within a while he met with Sir Ector de Maris, and he knew not
King Arthur nor Sir Tristram, and he desired to joust with one of them.
Then Sir Tristram rode unto Sir Ector, and smote him from his horse.</p>
<p>And when he had done so he came again to the king and said, ‘My lord,
yonder is one of your knights, he may bear you fellowship, and another
day that deed that I have done for you I trust to God ye shall
understand that I would do you service.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said King Arthur, ‘let me wit what ye are?’</p>
<p>‘Not at this time,’ said Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>So he departed and left King Arthur and Sir Ector together.</p>
