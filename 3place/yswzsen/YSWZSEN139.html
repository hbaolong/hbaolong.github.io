<h4 id="chapter-19">Chapter 19</h4>
<p>How Beaumains came to the lady, and when he came to the castle the
gates were closed against him, and of the words that the lady said to
him</p>
<p>Now turn we unto Sir Beaumains that desired of Lynet that he might
see her sister, his lady.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ she said, ‘I would fain ye saw her.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Beaumains all armed him, and took his horse and his spear,
and rode straight unto the castle. And when he came to the gate he found
there many men armed, and pulled up the drawbridge and drew the port
close. Then marvelled he why they would not suffer him to enter.</p>
<p>And then he looked up to the window; and there he saw the fair
Lyonesse that said on high, ‘Go thy way, Sir Beaumains, for as yet thou
shalt not have wholly my love, unto the time that thou be called one of
the number of the worthy knights. And therefore go labour in worship
this twelvemonth, and then thou shalt hear new tidings.’</p>
<p>‘Alas, fair lady,’ said Beaumains, ‘I have not deserved that ye
should show me this strangeness, and I had weened that I should have
right good cheer with you, and unto my power I have deserved thank, and
well I am sure I have bought your love with part of the best blood
within my body.’</p>
<p>‘Fair courteous knight,’ said Dame Lyonesse, ‘be not displeased nor
over-hasty; for wit you well your great travail nor good love shall not
be lost, for I consider your great travail and labour, your bounty and
your goodness as me ought to do. And therefore go on your way, and look
that ye be of good comfort, for all shall be for your worship and for
the best, and perdy a twelvemonth will soon be done, and trust me, fair
knight, I shall be true to you, and never to betray you, but to my death
I shall love you and none other.’</p>
<p>And therewithal she turned her from the window, and Sir Beaumains
rode awayward from the castle, making great dole, and so he rode here
and there and wist not ne where he rode, till it was dark night. And
then it happened him to come to a poor man’s house, and there he was
harboured all that night. But Sir Beaumains had no rest, but wallowed
and writhed for the love of the lady of the castle.</p>
<p>And so upon the morrow he took his horse and rode until undern, and
then he came to a broad water, and thereby was a great lodge, and there
he alit to sleep and laid his head upon the shield, and betook his horse
to the dwarf, and commanded him to watch all night.</p>
<p>Now turn we to the lady of the same castle, that thought much upon
Beaumains, and then she called unto her Sir Gringamore her brother, and
prayed him in all manner, as he loved her heartily, that he would ride
after Sir Beaumains: ‘And ever have ye wait upon him till ye may find
him sleeping, for I am sure in his heaviness he will alight down in some
place, and lie him down to sleep; and therefore have ye your wait upon
him, and in the priviest manner ye can, take his dwarf, and go ye your
way with him as fast as ever ye may or Sir Beaumains awake. For my
sister Lynet telleth me that he can tell of what kindred he is come, and
what is his right name. And the meanwhile I and my sister will ride unto
your castle to await when ye bring with you the dwarf. And then when ye
have brought him unto your castle, I will have him in examination
myself. Unto the time that I know what is his right name, and of what
kindred he is come, shall I never be merry at my heart.’</p>
<p>‘Sister,’ said Sir Gringamore, ‘all this shall be done after your
intent.’</p>
<p>And so he rode all the other day and the night till that he found Sir
Beaumains lying by a water, and his head upon his shield, for to sleep.
And then when he saw Sir Beaumains fast asleep, he came stilly stalking
behind the dwarf, and plucked him fast under his arm, and so he rode
away with him as fast as ever he might unto his own castle. And this Sir
Gringamore’s arms were all black, and that to him longeth. But ever as
he rode with the dwarf toward his castle, he cried unto his lord and
prayed him of help. And therewith awoke Sir Beaumains, and up he leapt
lightly, and saw where Sir Gringamore rode his way with the dwarf, and
so Sir Gringamore rode out of his sight.</p>
<p>perdy: indeed. undent: about 9 a.m. or later.</p>
