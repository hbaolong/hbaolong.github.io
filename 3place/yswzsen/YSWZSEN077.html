<h4 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h4>
<p>How Morgan le Fay saved a knight that should have been drowned, and
how King Arthur returned home again</p>
<p>Then said Morgan, ‘Saw ye Arthur, my brother?’</p>
<p>‘Yea,’ said her knights, ‘right well, and that ye should have found
and we might have stirred from one stead, for by his armyvestal1
countenance he would have caused us to have fled’</p>
<p>‘I believe you,’ said Morgan.</p>
<p>Anon after as she rode she met a knight leading another knight on his
horse before him, bound hand and foot, blindfold, to have drowned him in
a fountain. When she saw this knight so bound, she asked him, ‘What will
ye do with that knight?’</p>
<p>‘Lady,’ said he, ‘I will drown him.’</p>
<p>‘For what cause?’ she asked.</p>
<p>‘For I found him with my wife, and she shall have the same death
anon.’</p>
<p>‘That were pity,’ said Morgan le Fay. ‘Now, what say ye, knight, is
it truth that he saith of you?’ she said to the knight that should be
drowned.</p>
<p>‘Nay truly, madam, he saith not right on me.’</p>
<p>‘Of whence be ye,’ said Morgan le Fay, ‘and of what country?’</p>
<p>‘I am of the court of King Arthur, and my name is Manassen, cousin
unto Accolon of Gaul.’</p>
<p>‘Ye say well,’ said she, ‘and for the love of him ye shall be
delivered, and ye shall have your adversary in the same case ye be
in.’</p>
<p>So Manassen was loosed and the other knight bound. And anon Manassen
unarmed him, and armed himself in his harness, and so mounted on
horseback, and the knight afore him, and so threw him into the fountain
and drowned him. And then he rode unto Morgan again, and asked if she
would anything unto King Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Tell him that I rescued thee, not for the love of him but for the
love of Accolon, and tell him I fear him not while I can make me and
them that be with me in likeness of stones; and let him wit I can do
much more when I see my time.’</p>
<p>And so she departed into the country of Gore, and there was she
richly received, and made her castles and towns passing strong, for
always she dread much King Arthur.</p>
<p>When the king had well rested him at the abbey, he rode unto Camelot,
and found his queen and his barons right glad of his coming. And when
they heard of his strange adventures as is afore rehearsed, then all had
marvel of the falsehood of Morgan le Fay; many knights wished her burnt.
Then came Manassen to court and told the king of his adventure.</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said the king, ‘she is a kind sister; I shall so be avenged
on her and I live, that all Christendom shall speak of it.’</p>
<p>So on the morn there came a damosel from Morgan to the king, and she
brought with her the richest mantle that ever was seen in that court,
for it was set as full of precious stones as one might stand by another,
and there were the richest stones that ever the king saw. And the
damosel said, ‘Your sister sendeth you this mantle, and desireth that ye
should take this gift of her; and in what thing she hath offended you,
she will amend it at your own pleasure.’</p>
<p>When the king beheld this mantle it pleased him much, but he said but
little.</p>
<p>stead: place.</p>
