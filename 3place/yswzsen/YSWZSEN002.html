<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>
<p>First, How Uther Pendragon sent for the Duke of Cornwall and Igraine
his wife, and of their departing suddenly again</p>
<p>It befell in the days of Uther Pendragon, when he was king of all
England, and so reigned, that there was a mighty duke in Cornwall that
held war against him long time. And the duke was called the Duke of
Tintagel. And so by means King Uther sent for this duke, charging him to
bring his wife with him, for she was called a fair lady, and a passing
wise, and her name was called Igraine.</p>
<p>So when the duke and his wife were comen unto the king, by the means
of great lords they were accorded both. The king liked and loved this
lady well, and he made them great cheer out of measure, and desired to
have lain by her. But she was a passing good woman, and would not assent
unto the king. And then she told the duke her husband, and said, ‘I
suppose that we were sent for that I should be dishonoured, wherefore,
husband, I counsel you that we depart from hence suddenly, that we may
ride all night unto our own castle.’ And in like wise as she said so
they departed, that neither the king nor none of his council were ware
of their departing.</p>
<p>As soon as King Uther knew of their departing so suddenly, he was
wonderly wroth. Then he called to him his privy council, and told them
of the sudden departing of the duke and his wife. Then they advised the
king to send for the duke and his wife by a great charge: ‘And if he
will not come at your summons, then may ye do your best, then have ye
cause to make mighty war upon him.’</p>
<p>So that was done, and the messengers had their answers, and that was
this shortly, that neither he nor his wife would not come at him. Then
was the king wonderly wroth. And then the king sent him plain word
again, and bad him be ready and stuff him and garnish him, for within
forty days he would fetch him out of the biggest castle that he
hath.</p>
<p>When the duke had this warning, anon he went and furnished and
garnished two strong castles of his, of the which the one hight
Tintagel, and the other castle hight Terrabil. So his wife Dame Igraine
he put in the Castle of Tintagel, and himself he put in the Castle of
Terrabil, the which had many issues and posterns out. Then in all haste
came Uther with a great host, and laid a siege about the Castle of
Terrabil. And there he pitched many pavilions, and there was great war
made on both parties, and much people slain.</p>
<p>Then for pure anger and for great love of fair Igraine the King Uther
fell sick. So came to the King Uther Sir Ulfius, a noble knight, and
asked the king why he was sick.</p>
<p>‘I shall tell thee,’ said the king. ‘I am sick for anger and for love
of fair Igraine that I may not be whole.’</p>
<p>‘Well, my lord,’ said Sir Ulfius, ‘I shall seek Merlin, and he shall
do you remedy, that your heart shall be pleased.’</p>
<p>So Ulfius departed, and by adventure he met Merlin in a beggar’s
array, and there Merlin asked Ulfius whom he sought. And he said he had
little ado to tell him.</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Merlin, ‘I know whom thou seekest, for thou seekest
Merlin; therefore seek no farther, for I am he, and if King Uther will
well reward me, and be sworn unto me to fulfil my desire, that shall be
his honour and profit more than mine, for I shall cause him to have all
his desire.’</p>
<p>‘All this will I undertake,’ said Ulfius, ‘that there shall be
nothing reasonable but thou shalt have thy desire.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Merlin, ‘he shall have his intent and desire. And
therefore,’ said Merlin, ‘ride on your way, for I will not be long
behind.’</p>
<p>passing: exceedingly, cheer: entertainment.</p>
<p>stuff him and garnish him: make provision against a siege.</p>
