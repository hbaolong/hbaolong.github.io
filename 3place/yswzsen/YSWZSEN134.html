<h4 id="chapter-14">Chapter 14</h4>
<p>How the lady that was besieged had word from her sister how she had
brought a knight to fight for her, and what battles he had achieved</p>
<p>So the book saith that the lady that was besieged had word of her
sister’s coming by the dwarf, and a knight with her, and how he had
passed all the perilous passages.</p>
<p>‘What manner a man is he?’ said the lady.</p>
<p>‘He is a noble knight truly, madam,’ said the dwarf, ‘and but a young
man, but he is as likely a man as ever ye saw any.’</p>
<p>‘What is he?’ said the damosel, ‘and of what kin is he comen, and of
whom was he made knight?’</p>
<p>‘Madam,’ said the dwarf, ‘he is the King’s son of Orkney, but his
name I will not tell you as at this time; but wit ye well, of Sir
Launcelot was he made knight, for of none other would he be made knight,
and Sir Kay named him Beaumains.’</p>
<p>‘How escaped he,’ said the lady, ‘from the brethren of Persant?’</p>
<p>‘Madam,’ he said, ‘as a noble knight should. First, he slew two
brethren at a passage of a water.’</p>
<p>‘Ah!’ said she, ‘they were good knights, but they were murderers, the
one hight Garard de Breuse, and the other knight hight Sir Arnold de
Breuse.’</p>
<p>‘Then, madam, he recountered with the Black Knight, and slew him in
plain battle, and so he took his horse and his armour and fought with
the Green Knight and won him in plain battle, and in like wise he served
the Red Knight, and after in the same wise he served the Blue Knight and
won him in plain battle.’</p>
<p>‘Then,’ said the lady, ‘he hath overcome Sir Persant of Inde, one of
the noblest knights of the world.’</p>
<p>And the dwarf said, ‘He hath won all the four brethren and slain the
Black Knight, and yet he did more tofore: he overthrew Sir Kay and left
him nigh dead upon the ground; also he did a great battle with Sir
Launcelot, and there they departed on even hands: and then Sir Launcelot
made him knight.’</p>
<p>‘Dwarf,’ said the lady, ‘I am glad of these tidings, therefore go
thou in an hermitage of mine hereby, and there shalt thou bear with thee
of my wine in two flagons of silver, they are of two gallons, and also
two cast of bread with fat venison baked, and dainty fowls; and a cup of
gold here I deliver thee, that is rich and precious; and bear all this
to mine hermitage, and put it in the hermit’s hands. And sithen go thou
unto my sister and greet her well, and commend me unto that gentle
knight, and pray him to eat and to drink and make him strong, and say ye
him I thank him of his courtesy and goodness, that he would take upon
him such labour for me that never did him bounty nor courtesy. Also pray
him that he be of good heart and courage, for he shall meet with a full
noble knight, but he is neither of bounty, courtesy, nor gentleness; for
he attendeth unto nothing but to murder, and that is the cause I cannot
praise him nor love him.’</p>
<p>So this dwarf departed, and came to Sir Persant, where he found the
damosel Lynet and Sir Beaumains, and there he told them all as ye have
heard; and then they took their leave, but Sir Persant took an ambling
hackney and conveyed them on their ways, and then beleft them to God;
and so within a little while they came to that hermitage, and there they
drank the wine, and ate the venison and the fowls baken.</p>
<p>And so when they had repasted them well, the dwarf returned again
with his vessel unto the castle again; and there met with him the Red
Knight of the Red Launds, and asked him from whence that he came, and
where he had been.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the dwarf, ‘I have been with my lady’s sister of this
castle and she hath been at King Arthur’s court, and brought a knight
with her.’</p>
<p>‘Then I account her travail but lost; for though she had brought with
her Sir Launcelot, Sir Tristram, Sir Lamorak, or Sir Gawain, I would
think myself good enough for them all.’</p>
<p>‘It may well be,’ said the dwarf, ‘but this knight hath passed all
the perilous passages, and slain the Black Knight and other two more,
and won the Green Knight, the Red Knight, and the Blue Knight.’</p>
<p>‘Then is he one of these four that I have afore rehearsed.’</p>
<p>‘He is none of those,’ said the dwarf, ‘but he is a king’s son.’</p>
<p>‘What is his name?’ said the Red Knight of the Red Launds.</p>
<p>‘That will I not tell you,’ said the dwarf, ‘but Sir Kay upon scorn
named him Beaumains.’</p>
<p>‘I care not,’ said the knight, ‘what knight so ever he be, for I
shall soon deliver him. And if I ever match him he shall have a shameful
death as many other have had.’</p>
<p>‘That were pity,’ said the dwarf, ‘and it is marvel that ye make such
shameful war upon noble knights.’</p>
<p>on even hands: with honours even.</p>
