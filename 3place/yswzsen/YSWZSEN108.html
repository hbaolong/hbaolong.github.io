<h4 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h4>
<p>How Sir Launcelot was received of King Bagdemagus’ daughter, and he
made his complaint to her father</p>
<p>And soon as Sir Launcelot came within the abbey yard, the daughter of
King Bagdemagus heard a great horse go on the pavement. And she then
arose and yede unto a window, and there she saw Sir Launcelot, and anon
she made men fast to take his horse from him and let lead him into a
stable, and himself was led into a fair chamber, and unarmed him, and
the lady sent him a long gown, and anon she came herself. And then she
made Launcelot passing good cheer, and she said he was the knight in the
world was most welcome to her.</p>
<p>Then in all haste she sent for her father Bagdemagus that was within
twelve mile of that abbey, and afore even he came with a fair fellowship
of knights with him. And when the king was alit off his horse he yode
straight unto Sir Launcelot’s chamber and there he found his daughter,
and then the king embraced Sir Launcelot in his arms and either made
other good cheer.</p>
<p>Anon Sir Launcelot made his complaint unto the king how he was
betrayed, and how his brother Sir Lionel was departed from him he nist
not where, and how his daughter had delivered him out of prison.
‘Therefore while I live I shall do her service and all her kindred.’</p>
<p>‘Then am I sure of your help,’ said the king, ‘on Tuesday next
coming?’</p>
<p>‘Yea, sir,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘I shall not fail you, for so I have
promised my lady your daughter. But sir, what knights be they of my lord
Arthur’s that were with the King of Northgales?’</p>
<p>And the king said, ‘It was Sir Mador de la Porte, and Sir Mordred and
Sir Gahalantine that all for-fared my knights, for against them three I
nor my knights might bear no strength.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘as I hear say that the tournament shall
be here within this three mile of this abbey, ye shall send unto me
three knights of yours, such as ye trust, and look that the three
knights have all white shields, and I also, and no painture on the
shields, and we four will come out of a little wood in midst of both
parties, and we shall fall in the front of our enemies and grieve them
that we may; and thus shall I not be known what knight I am.’</p>
<p>So they took their rest that night, and this was on the Sunday, and
so the king departed, and sent unto Sir Launcelot three knights with the
four white shields. And on the Tuesday they lodged them in a little
leaved wood beside there the tournament should be. And there were
scaffolds and holes that lords and ladies might behold and to give the
prize.</p>
<p>Then came into the field the King of Northgales with eight score
helms. And then the three knights of Arthur’s stood by themself. Then
came into the field King Bagdemagus with four score of helms. And then
they fewtered their spears, and came together with a great dash, and
there were slain of knights at the first recounter twelve of King
Badgemagus’ party, and six of the King of Northgales’ party, and King
Bagdemagus’ party was far set aback.</p>
<p>nist: did not know, holes: i.e. windows.</p>
