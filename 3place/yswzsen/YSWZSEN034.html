<h4 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h4>
<p>How a damosel, which was Love to Lanceor, slew herself for love, and
how Balin met with his brother Balan</p>
<p>Then he looked by him, and was ware of a damosel that came riding1
full fast as the horse might ride, on a fair palfrey. And when she espie
dthat Lanceor was slain, she made sorrow out of measure, and said, ‘O
Balin, two bodies thou hast slain and one heart, and two hearts in one
body, and two souls thou hast lost.’ And therewith she took the sword
from her love that lay dead, and fell to the ground in a swoon.</p>
<p>And when she arose she made great dole out of measure, the which
sorrow grieved Balin passingly sore, and he went unto her for to have
taken the sword out of her hand, but she held it so fast he might not
take it out of her hand unless he should have hurt her, and suddenly she
set the pommel to the ground, and rove herself through the body.</p>
<p>When Balin espied her deeds, he was passing heavy in his heart, and
ashamed that so fair a damosel had destroyed herself for the love of his
death. ‘Alas,’ said Balin, ‘me repenteth sore the death of this knight,
for the love of this damosel, for there was much true love betwixt them
both,’ and for sorrow might not longer behold him, but turned his horse
and looked toward a great forest.</p>
<p>And there he was ware, by the arms, of his brother Balan. And when
they were met they put off their helms and kissed together, and wept for
joy and pity.</p>
<p>Then Balan said, ‘I little weened to have met with you at this sudden
adventure; I am right glad of your deliverance of your dolorous
prisonment, for a man told me, in the Castle of Four Stones, that ye
were delivered, and that man had seen you in the court of Wing Arthur,
and therefore I came hither into this country, for here I supposed to
find you.’</p>
<p>Anon the knight Balin told his brother of his adventure of the sword,
and of the death of the Lady of the Lake, and how King Arthur was
displeased with him. ‘Wherefore he sent this knight after me, that lieth
here dead, and the death of this damosel grieveth me sore.’</p>
<p>‘So doth it me,’ said Balan, ‘but ye must take the adventure that God
will ordain you.’</p>
<p>‘Truly,’ said Balin, ‘I am right heavy that my lord Arthur is
displeased with me, for he is the most worshipful knight that reigneth
now on earth, and his love will I get or else I will put my life in
adventure, for the King Rience lieth at a siege at Castle Terrabil, and
thither will we draw in all haste, to prove our worship and prowess upon
him.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said Balan, ‘that we do, and we will help each other
as brethren ought to do.’</p>
