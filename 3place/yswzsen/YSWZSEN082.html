<h4 id="chapter-20">Chapter 20</h4>
<p>How a knight and a dwarf strove for a lady</p>
<p>And therewith he passed unto the one side of the laund; and on the
other side saw Sir Gawain ten knights that hoved still and made1 them
ready with their shields and spears against that one knight that came by
Sir Gawain. Then this one knight aventred a great spear, and one of the
ten knights encountered with him, but this woeful knight smote him so
hard that he fell over his horse’s tail. So this same dolorous knight
served them all, that at the leastway he smote down horse and man, and
all he did with one spear; and so when they were all ten on foot, they
went to that one knight, and he stood stone still, and suffered them to
pull him down off his horse, and bound him hand and foot and tied him
under the horse’s belly, and so led him with them.</p>
<p>‘O Jesu!’ said Sir Gawain, ‘this is a doleful sight, to see the
yonder knight so to be entreated, and it seemeth by the knight that he
suffereth them to bind him so, for he maketh no resistance.’</p>
<p>‘No,’ said his host, ‘that is truth, for and he would, they all were
too weak so to do him.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the damosel unto Sir Gawain, ‘meseemeth it were your
worship to help that dolorous knight, for methinketh he is one of the
best knights that ever I saw.’</p>
<p>‘I would do for him,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘but it seemeth he will have
no help.’</p>
<p>‘Then,’ said the damosel, ‘methinketh ye have no lust to help
him.’</p>
<p>Thus as they talked they saw a knight on the other side of the laund
all armed save the head. And on the other side there came a dwarf on
horseback all armed save the head, with a great mouth and a short nose;
and when the dwarf came nigh he said, ‘Where is the lady should meet us
here?’</p>
<p>And therewithal she came forth out of the wood. And then they began
to strive for the lady; for the knight said he would have her, and the
dwarf said he would have her.</p>
<p>‘Will we do well?’ said the dwarf. ‘Yonder is a knight at the cross,
let us put it both upon him, and as he deemeth so shall it be.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said the knight.</p>
<p>And so they went all three unto Sir Gawain and told him wherefore
they strove.</p>
<p>‘Well, sirs,’ said he, ‘will ye put the matter in my hand?’</p>
<p>‘Yea,’ they said both.</p>
<p>‘Now damosel,’ said Sir Gawain, ‘ye shall stand betwixt them both,
and whether ye list better to go to, he shall have you.’</p>
<p>And when she was set between them both, she left the knight and went
to the dwarf, and the dwarf took her and went his way singing, and the
knight went his way with great mourning.</p>
<p>Then came there two knights all armed, and cried on high, ‘Sir
Gawain, knight of King Arthur’s, make thee ready in all haste and joust
with me.’</p>
<p>So they ran together, that either fell down, and then on foot they
drew their swords, and did full actually.</p>
<p>The meanwhile the other knight went to the damosel, and asker her why
she abode with that knight, ‘and if ye would abide with me, I will be
your faithful knight.’</p>
<p>‘And with you will I be,’ said the damosel, ‘for with Sir Gawain I
may not find in mine heart to be with him; for now here was one knight
scomfit ten knights, and at the last he was cowardly led away and
therefore let us two go whilst they fight.’</p>
<p>And Sir Gawain fought with that other knight long, but at the last
they accorded both. And then the knight prayed Sir Gawain to lodge with
him that night.</p>
<p>So as Sir Gawain went with this knight he asked him, ‘What knight is
he in this country that smote down the ten knights? For when he had done
so manfully he suffered them to bind him hand and foot, and so led him
away.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said the knight, ’that is the best knight I trow in the world,
and the most man of prowess, and he hath been served so as he was even
more than ten times, and his name hight Sir Pelleas, and he loveth a
great lady in this country and her name is Ettard. And so when he loved
her there was cried in this country a great jousts three days, and all
the knights of this country were there and gentlewomen, and who that
proved him the best knight should have a passing good sword and a
circlet of gold, and the circlet the knight should give it to the
fairest lady that was at the jousts. And this knight Sir Pelleas was the
best knight that was there, and there were five hundred knights, but
there was never man that ever Sir Pelleas met withal but he struck him
down, or else from his horse; and every day of three days he struck down
twenty knights, therefore they gave him the prize. And forthwithal he
went thereas the lady Ettard was, and gave her the circlet, and said
openly she was the fairest lady that there was, and that would he prove
upon any knight that would say nay.</p>
