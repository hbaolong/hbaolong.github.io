<p>8: How Sir Launcelot and Sir Turquin fought together</p>
<p>And then they put their spears in the rests, and came together with
their horses as fast as they might run, and either smote other in midst
of their shields that both their horses’ backs brast under them and the
knights were both astonied, and as soon as they might avoid their horses
they took their shields afore them, and drew out their swords, and came
together eagerly, and either gave other many strong strokes, for there
might neither shields nor harness hold their strokes. And so within a
while they had both grimly wounds, and bled passing grievously. Thus
they fared two hours or more tracing and rasing either other where they
might hit any bare place. Then at the last they were breathless both,
and stood leaning on their swords.</p>
<p>‘Now fellow,’ said Sir Turquin, ‘hold thy hand a while, and tell me
what I shall ask thee.’</p>
<p>‘Say on.’</p>
<p>Then Turquin said, ‘Thou art the biggest man that ever I met withal,
and the best breathed, and like one knight that I hate above all other
knights; so be it that thou be not he I will lightly accord with thee,
and for thy love I will deliver all the prisoners that I have, that is
three score and four, so thou wilt tell me thy name. And thou and I we
will be fellows together, and never to fail the while that I live.’</p>
<p>‘It is well said,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘but sithen it is so that I
may have thy friendship, what knight is he that thou so hatest above all
other?’</p>
<p>‘Faithfully,’ said Sir Turquin, ‘his name is Sir Launcelot du Lake,
for he slew my brother, Sir Carados, at the Dolorous Tower, that was one
of the best knights alive; and therefore him I except of all knights,
for may I once meet with him, the one of us shall make an end of other,
I make mine avow. And for Sir Launcelot’s sake I have slain an hundred
good knights, and as many I have maimed all utterly that they might
never after help themself, and many have died in prison, and yet have I
three score and four, and all shall be delivered so thou wilt tell me
thy name, so be it that thou be not Sir Launcelot.’</p>
<p>‘Now, see I well,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘that such a man I might be, I
might have peace, and such a man I might be, that there should be war
mortal betwixt us. And now, sir knight, at thy request I will that thou
wit and know that I am Launcelot du Lake, King Ban’s son of Benwick, and
very knight of the Table Round. And now I defy thee, and do thy
best.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said Turquin, ‘Launcelot, thou art unto me most welcome that
ever was knight, for we shall never depart till the one of us be
dead.’</p>
<p>Then they hurtled together as two wild bulls rashing and lashing with
their shields and swords, that sometime they fell both over their noses.
Thus they fought still two hours and more, and never would have rest,
and Sir Turquin gave Sir Launcelot many wounds that all the ground
thereas they fought was all bespeckled with blood.</p>
<p>tracing: pursuing, rasing: slashing.</p>
