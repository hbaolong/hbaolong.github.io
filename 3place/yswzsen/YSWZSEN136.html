<h4 id="chapter-16">Chapter 16</h4>
<p>How the two Knights met together, and of their talking, and how they
began their battle</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the damosel Lynet unto Sir Beaumains, ‘look ye be glad
and light, for yonder is your deadly enemy, and at yonder window is my
lady, my sister, Dame Lyonesse.’</p>
<p>‘Where?’ said Beaumains.</p>
<p>‘Yonder,’ said the damosel, and pointed with her finger.</p>
<p>‘That is truth,’ said Beaumains. ‘She beseemeth afar the fairest lady
that ever I looked upon; and truly,’ he said, ‘I ask no better quarrel
than now for to do battle, for truly she shall be my lady, and for her I
will fight.’</p>
<p>And ever he looked up to the window with glad countenance. And the
Lady Lyonesse made curtsey to him down to the earth, with holding up
both their hands.</p>
<p>With that the Red Knight of the Red Launds called to Sir Beaumains,
‘Leave, sir knight, thy looking, and behold me, I counsel thee; for I
warn thee well she is my lady, and for her I have done many strong
battles.’</p>
<p>‘If thou have so done,’ said Beaumains, ‘meseemeth it was but waste
labour, for she loveth none of thy fellowship, and thou to love that
loveth not thee is but great folly. For and I understand that she were
not glad of my coming, I would be advised or I did battle for her. But I
understand by the sieging of this castle she may forbear thy fellowship.
And therefore wit thou well, thou Red Knight of the Red Launds, I love
her, and will rescue her, or else to die.’</p>
<p>‘Sayest thou that?’ said the Red Knight, ‘meseemeth thou ought of
reason to be ware by yonder knights that thou sawest hang upon yonder
trees.’</p>
<p>‘Fie for shame,’ said Beaumains, ‘that ever thou shouldest say or do
so evil, for in that thou shamest thyself and knighthood, and thou
mayest be sure there will no lady love thee that knoweth thy wicked
customs. And now thou weenest that the sight of these hanged knights
should fear me. Nay truly, not so; that shameful sight causeth me to
have courage and hardiness against thee, more than I would have had
against thee and thou were a well-ruled knight.’</p>
<p>‘Make thee ready,’ said the Red Knight of the Red Launds, ‘and talk
no longer with me.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Beaumains bad the damosel go from him; and then they put
their spears in their rests, and came together with all their might that
they had both, and either smote other in midst of their shields that the
paytrels, surcingles, and cruppers brast, and fell to the earth both,
and the reins of their bridles in their hands; and so they lay a great
while sore stonied, that all that were in the castle and in the siege
weened their necks had been broken.</p>
<p>And then many a stranger and other said the strange knight was a big
man, and a noble jouster, ‘for or now we saw never no knight match the
Red Knight of the Red Launds’. Thus they said both within the castle and
without.</p>
<p>Then lightly they avoided their horses and put their shields afore
them, and drew their swords and ran together like two fierce lions, and
either gave other such buffets upon their helms that they reeled
backward both two strides; and then they recovered both, and hew great
pieces off their harness and their shields that a great part fell into
the fields.</p>
<p>paytrels: breast armour for a horse- surcingles: girths for a
horse.</p>
