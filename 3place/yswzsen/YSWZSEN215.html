<h4 id="chapter-19">Chapter 19</h4>
<p>How it was noised how Sir Tristram was dead, and how La Beale Isoud
would have slain herself</p>
<p>Then Sir Andred, that was cousin unto Sir Tristram, made a lady that
was his paramour to say and to noise it that she was with Sir Tristram
or ever he died. And this tale she brought unto King Mark’s court, that
she buried him by a well, and that or he died he besought King Mark to
make his cousin, Sir Andred, king of the country of Liones, of the which
Sir Tristram was lord of. All this did Sir Andred because he would have
had Sir Tristram’s lands.</p>
<p>And when King Mark heard tell that Sir Tristram was dead he wept and
made great dole. But when Queen Isoud heard of these tidings she made
such sorrow that she was nigh out of her mind; and so upon a day she
thought to slay herself and never to live after Sir Tristram’s
death.</p>
<p>And so upon a day La Beale Isoud gat a sword privily and bare it into
her garden, and there she pitched the sword through a plum tree up to
the hilts, so that it stuck fast, and it stood breast high. And as she
would have run upon the sword and to have slain herself all this espied
King Mark, how she kneeled down and said, ‘Sweet Lord Jesu, have mercy
upon me, for I may not live after the death of Sir Tristram de Liones,
for he was my first love and he shall be the last.’</p>
<p>And with these words came King Mark and took her in his arms, and
then he took up the sword, and bare her away with him into a tower; and
there he made her to be kept, and watched her surely, and after that she
lay long sick, nigh at the point of death.</p>
<p>This meanwhile ran Sir Tristram naked in the forest with the sword in
his hand, and so he came to an hermitage, and there he laid him down and
slept; and in the meanwhile the hermit stole away his sword, and laid
meat down by him. Thus was he kept there a ten days; and at the last he
departed and came to the herdmen again.</p>
<p>And there was a giant in that country that hight Tawleas, and for
fear of Sir Tristram more than seven year he durst never much go at
large, but for the most part he kept him in a sure castle of his own;
and so this Tawleas heard tell that Sir Tristram was dead, by the noise
of the court of King Mark.</p>
<p>Then this Tawleas went daily at large. And so he happed upon a day he
came to the herdmen wandering and lingering, and there he set him down
to rest among them. The meanwhile there came a knight of Cornwall that
led a lady with him, and his name was Sir Dinaunt; and when the giant
saw him he went from the herdmen and hid him under a tree, and so the
knight came to that well, and there he alit to repose him.</p>
<p>And as soon as he was from his horse this giant Tawleas came betwixt
this knight and his horse, and took the horse and leapt upon him. So
forthwith he rode unto Sir Dinaunt and took him by the collar, and
pulled him afore him upon his horse, and there would have stricken off
his head.</p>
<p>Then the herdmen said unto Sir Tristram, ‘Help yonder knight.’</p>
<p>‘Help ye him,’ said Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>‘We dare not,’ said the herdmen.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram was ware of the sword of the knight thereas it lay,
and so thither he ran and took up the sword and struck off Sir Tawleas’
head, and so he yede his way to the herdmen.</p>
