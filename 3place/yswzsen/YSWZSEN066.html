<h4 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h4>
<p>How the battle was finished or he came, and how the king founded an
abbey where the battle was</p>
<p>Therewithal came one to King Arthur, and told him that King Pellinor
was within three mile with a great host.</p>
<p>And he said, ‘Go unto him, and let him understand how we have
sped.’</p>
<p>So within a while King Pellinor came with a great host, and saluted
the people and the king, and there was great joy made on every side.
Then the king let search how much people of his party there was slain;
and there were found but little past two hundred men slain and eight
knights of the Table Round in their pavilions.</p>
<p>Then the king let rear and devise in the same place thereas the
battle was done a fair abbey, and endowed it with great livelihood, and
let it call the Abbey of La Beale Adventure. But when some of them came
into their countries, thereof the five kings were kings, and told them
how they were slain, there was made great dole. And all King Arthur’s
enemies, as the King of North Wales, and the kings of the North, wist of
the battle; they were passing heavy. And so the king returned unto
Camelot in haste.</p>
<p>And when he was come to Camelot he called King Pellinor unto him, and
said, ‘Ye understand well that we have lost eight knights of the best of
the Table Round, and by your advice we will choose eight again of the
best we may find in this court.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Pellinor, ‘I shall counsel you after my conceit the best:
there are in your court full noble knights both of old and young; and
therefore by mine advice ye shall choose half of the old and half of the
young.’</p>
<p>‘Which be the old?’ said King Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said King Pellinor, ‘meseemeth that King Uriens that hath
wedded your sister Morgan le Fay, and the King of the Lake, and Sir
Hervis de Revel, a noble knight, and Sir Galagars, the fourth.’</p>
<p>‘This is well devised,’ said King Arthur, ‘and right so shall it be.
Now, which are the four young knights?’ said Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Pellinor, ‘the first is Sir Gawain, your nephew, that is
as good a knight of his time as any is in this land; and the second as
meseemeth best is Sir Griflet le Fise de Dieu, that is a good knight and
full desirous in arms, and who may see him live he shall prove a good
knight; and the third as meseemeth is well to be one of the knights of
the Round Table, Sir Kay the Seneschal, for many times he hath done full
worshipfully, and now at your last battle he did full honourably for to
undertake to slay two kings.’</p>
<p>‘By my head,’ said Arthur, ‘he is best worthy to be a knight of the
Round Table of any that ye have rehearsed, and he had done no more
prowess in his life days.’</p>
