<h4 id="chapter-16">Chapter 16</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram came to La Beale Isoud, and how Kehydius began to
love Beale Isoud, and of a letter that Tristram found</p>
<p>And then at a day set Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak met at the well;
and then they took Kehydius at the forester’s house, and so they rode
with him to the ship where they left Dame Bragwaine and Gouvernail, and
so they sailed into Cornwall all wholly together.</p>
<p>And by assent and information of Dame Bragwaine when they were landed
they rode unto Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, a trusty friend of Sir
Tristram’s. And so Dame Bragwaine and Sir Dinas rode to the court of
King Mark, and told the queen, La Beale Isoud, that Sir Tristram was
nigh her in that country.</p>
<p>Then for very pure joy La Beale Isoud swooned; and when she might
speak she said, ‘Gentle knight, seneschal, help that I might speak with
him, other my heart will brast.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Dinas and Dame Bragwaine brought Sir Tristram and Kehydius
privily unto the court, unto a chamber whereas La Beale Isoud had
assigned it; and to tell the joys that were betwixt La Beale Isoud and
Sir Tristram, there is no tongue can tell it, nor heart think it, nor
pen write it.</p>
<p>And as the French book maketh mention, at the first time that ever
Sir Kehydius saw La Beale Isoud he was so enamoured upon her that for
very pure love he might never withdraw it. And at the last, as ye shall
hear or the book be ended, Sir Kehydius died for the love of La Beale
Isoud.</p>
<p>And then privily he wrote unto her letters and ballads of the most
goodliest that were used in those days. And when La Beale Isoud
understood his letters she had pity of his complaint, and unadvised she
wrote another letter to comfort him withal.</p>
<p>And Sir Tristram was all this while in a turret at the commandment of
La Beale Isoud, and when she might she came unto Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>So on a day King Mark played at the chess under a chamber window; and
at that time Sir Tristram and Sir Kehydius were within the chamber over
King Mark, and as it mishapped Sir Tristram found the letter that
Kehydius sent unto La Beale Isoud, also he had found the letter that she
wrote unto Kehydius. And at that same time La Beale Isoud was in the
same chamber.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram came unto La Beale Isoud and said, ‘Madam, here is
a letter that was sent unto you, and here is the letter that ye sent
unto him that sent you that letter. Alas, Madam, the good love that I
have loved you, and many lands and riches have I forsaken for your love,
and now ye are a traitress to me, the which doth me great pain. But as
for thee, Sir Kehydius, I brought thee out of Brittany into this
country, and thy father, King Howel, I won his lands. Howbeit I wedded
thy sister Isoud la Blanche Mains for the goodness she did unto me, and
yet, as I am true knight, she is a clean maiden for me. But wit thou
well, Sir Kehydius, for this falsehood and treason thou hast done me, I
will revenge it upon thee.’ And therewithal Sir Tristram drew out his
sword and said, ‘Sir Kehydius, keep thee!’</p>
<p>And then La Beale Isoud swooned to the earth. And when Sir Kehydius
saw Sir Tristam come upon him he saw none other boot, but leapt out at a
bay-window even over the head where sat King Mark playing at the
chess.</p>
<p>And when the king saw one come hurling over his head, he said,
‘Fellow, what art thou, and what is the cause thou leapest out at that
window?’</p>
<p>‘My lord the king,’ said Kehydius, ‘it fortuned me that I was asleep
in the window above your head, and as I slept I slumbered, and so I fell
down.’ And thus Sir Kehydius excused him.</p>
