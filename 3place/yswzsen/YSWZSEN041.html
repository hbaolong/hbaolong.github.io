<h4 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h4>
<p>How Balin and the damosel met with a knight which was in likewise
slain, and how the damosel bled for the custom of a castle</p>
<p>So Balin and the damosel rode into a forest, and there met with a
knight that had been on hunting, and that knight asked Balin for what
cause he made so great sorrow.</p>
<p>‘Me list not to tell you,’ said Balin.</p>
<p>‘Now,’ said the knight, ‘and I were armed as ye be I would fight with
you.’</p>
<p>‘That should little need,’ said Balin, ‘I am not afeared to tell
you,’ and told him all the cause how it was.</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said the knight, ‘is this all? Here I ensure you by the faith
of my body never to depart from you while my life lasteth.’</p>
<p>And so they went to the hostelry and armed them, and so rode forth
with Balin. And as they came by an hermitage even by a churchyard, there
came the knight Garlon invisible, and smote this knight, Perin de
Mountbeliard, through the body with a spear.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said the knight, ‘I am slain by this traitor knight that
rideth invisible.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Balin, ‘it is not the first despite he hath done me.’
And there the hermit and Balin buried the knight under a rich stone and
a tomb royal.</p>
<p>And on the morn they found letters of gold written, how: SIR GAWAIN
SHALL REVENGE HIS FATHER’S DEATH, KING LOT, ON THE KING PELLINOR.</p>
<p>Anon after this Balin and the damosel rode till they came to a
castle, and there Balin alit, and he and the damosel went to go into the
castle, and anon as Balin came within the castle’s gate the portcullis
fell down at his back, and there fell many men about the damosel, and
would have slain her. When Balin saw that, he was sore aggrieved, for he
might not help the damosel; and then he went up into the tower, and
leapt over the walls into the ditch, and hurt him not; and anon he
pulled out his sword and would have foughten with them. And they all
said nay, they would not fight with him, for they did nothing but the
old custom of the castle, and told him how their lady was sick, and had
lain many years, and she might not be whole but if she had a dish of
silver full of blood of a clean maid and a king’s daughter; ‘and
therefore the custom of the castle is, there shall no damosel pass this
way but she shall bleed of her blood in a silver dish full.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Balin, ‘she shall bleed as much as she may bleed, but I
will not lose the life of her whiles my life lasteth.’</p>
<p>And so Balin made her to bleed by her good will, but her blood halp
not the lady. And so he and she rested there all night, and had there
right good cheer; and on the morn they passed on their ways. And as it
telleth after in the Sangrail, that Sir Percival’s sister halp that lady
with her blood, whereof she was dead.</p>
<p>clean: pure. halp: helped.</p>
