<h4 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h4>
<p>How Sir Launcelot behaved him in a tournament, and how he met with
Sir Turquin leading Sir Gaheris</p>
<p>With that came Sir Launcelot du Lake, and he thrust in with his spear
in the thickest of the press, and there he smote down with one spear
five knights, and of four of them he brake their backs. And in that
throng he smote down the King of Northgales, and brake his thigh in that
fall. All this doing of Sir Launcelot saw the three knights of
Arthur’s.</p>
<p>‘Yonder is a shrewd guest’, said Sir Mador de la Porte, ‘therefore
have here once at him.’</p>
<p>So they encountered, and Sir Launcelot bare him down horse and man,
so that his shoulder went out of lith.</p>
<p>‘Now befalleth it to me to joust,’ said Mordred, ‘for Sir Mador hath
a sore fall.’</p>
<p>Sir Launcelot was ware of him, and gat a great spear in his hand, and
met him, and Sir Mordred brake a spear upon him, and Sir Launcelot gave
him such a buffet that the arson of his saddle brake, and so he flew
over his horse’s tail, that his helm butted into the earth a foot and
more, that nigh his neck was broken; and there he lay long in a
swoon.</p>
<p>Then came in Sir Gahalantine with a great spear and Launcelot against
him, with all their strength that they might drive, that both their
spears to-brast even to their hands, and then they flung out with their
swords and gave many a grim stroke. Then was Sir Launcelot wroth out of
measure, and then he smote Sir Gahalantine on the helm that his nose
brast out on blood, and ears and mouth both, and therewith his head hung
low. And therewith his horse ran away with him, and he fell down to the
earth.</p>
<p>Anon therewithal Sir Launcelot gat a great spear in his hand, and or
ever that great spear brake, he bare down to the earth sixteen knights,
some horse and man, and some the man and not the horse, and there was
none but that he hit surely, he bare none arms that day. And then he gat
another great spear, and smote down twelve knights, and the most part of
them never throve after.</p>
<p>And then the knights of the King of Northgales would joust no more.
And there the gree was given to King Bagdemagus.</p>
<p>So either party departed unto his own place, and Sir Launcelot rode
forth with King Bagdemagus unto his castle, and there he had passing
good cheer both with the king and with his daughter, and they proffered
him great gifts. And on the morn he took his leave, and told the king
that he would go and seek his brother Sir Lionel, that went from him
when that he slept, so he took his horse, and betaught them all to
God.</p>
<p>And there he said unto the king’s daughter, ‘If ye have need any time
of my service I pray you let me have knowledge, and I shall not fail you
as I am true knight.’</p>
<p>And so Sir Launcelot departed, and by adventure he came into the same
forest there he was take sleeping. And in the midst of an highway he met
a damosel riding on a white palfrey, and there either saluted other.</p>
<p>‘Fair damosel,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘know ye in this country any
adventures?’</p>
<p>‘Sir knight’ said that damosel, ‘here are adventures near hand, and
thou durst prove them.’</p>
<p>‘Why should I not prove adventures?’ said Sir Launcelot. ‘For that
cause come I hither.’</p>
<p>‘Well’, said she, ‘thou seemest well to be a good knight, and if thou
dare meet with a good knight, I shall bring thee where is the best
knight, and the mightiest that ever thou found, so thou wilt tell me
what is thy name, and what knight thou art.’</p>
<p>‘Damosel, as for to tell thee my name I take no great force, truly my
name is Sir Launcelot du Lake.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, thou beseemest well; here be adventures by that fallen for
thee, for hereby dwelleth a knight that will not be overmatched for no
man I know but ye overmatch him, and his name is Sir Turquin. And, as I
understand, he hath in his prison, of Arthur’s court, good knights three
score and four, that he hath won with his own hands. But when ye have
done that journey ye shall promise me as ye are a true knight for to go
with me, and to help me and other damosels that are distressed daily
with a false knight.’</p>
<p>‘All your intent, damosel, and desire I will fulfil, so ye will bring
me unto this knight.’</p>
<p>‘Now, fair knight, come on your way;’ and so she brought him unto the
ford and the tree where hung the basin.</p>
<p>So Sir Launcelot let his horse drink, and sithen he beat on the basin
with the butt of his spear so hard with all his might till the bottom
fell out, and long he did so but he saw nothing.</p>
<p>Then he rode endlong the gates of that manor nigh half-an-hour. And
then was he ware of a great knight that drove an horse afore him, and
overthwart the horse there lay an armed knight bounden. And ever as they
came near and near, Sir Launcelot thought he should know him. Then Sir
Launcelot was ware that it was Sir Gaheris, Gawain’s brother, a knight
of the Table Round.</p>
<p>‘Now, fair damosel’, said Sir Launcelot, ‘I see yonder cometh a
knight fast bounden that is a fellow of mine, and brother he is unto Sir
Gawain. And at the first beginning I promise you, by the leave of God,
to rescue that knight; but if his master sit better in the saddle I
shall deliver all the prisoners that he hath out of danger, for I am
sure he hath two brethren of mine prisoners with him.’</p>
<p>By that time that either had seen other, they gripped their spears
unto them.</p>
<p>‘Now, fair knight,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘put that wounded knight off
the horse, and let him rest awhile, and let us two prove our strengths;
for as it is informed me, thou doest and hast done great despite and
shame unto knights of the Round Table, and therefore now defend
thee’</p>
<p>‘And thou be of the Table Round’, said Turquin, ‘I defy thee and all
thy fellowship.’</p>
<p>‘That is overmuch said’, said Sir Launcelot.</p>
<p>shrewd: mischievous, arson: saddle-bow.</p>
<p>betaught: commended.</p>
<p>beseemest: appear, endlong: along.</p>
