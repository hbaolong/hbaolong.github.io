<h4 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h4>
<p>How a damosel came into the court and desired a knight to take on him
an enquest, which La Cote Male Taile enprised</p>
<p>Then that same day there came a damosel into the court, and she
brought with her a great black shield, with a white hand in the midst
holding a sword. Other picture was there none in that shield. When King
Arthur saw her he asked her from whence she came and what she would.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ she said, ‘I have ridden long and many a day with this shield
many ways, and for this cause I am come to your court: there was a good
knight that ought this shield, and this knight had undertaken a great
deed of arms to achieve it; and so it misfortuned him another strong
knight met with him by sudden adventure, and there they fought long, and
either wounded other passing sore; and they were so weary that they left
that battle even hand. So this knight that ought this shield saw none
other way but he must die; and then he commanded me to bear this shield
to the court of King Arthur, he requiring and praying some good knight
to take this shield, and that he would fulfil the quest that he was
in.’</p>
<p>‘Now what say ye to this quest?’ said King Arthur. ‘Is there any of
you here that will take upon him to wield this shield?’</p>
<p>Then was there not one that would speak one word. Then Sir Kay took
the shield in his hands.</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ said the damosel, ‘what is your name?’</p>
<p>‘Wit ye well,’ said he, ‘my name is Sir Kay, the Seneschal, that
wide-where is known.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said that damosel, ‘lay down that shield, for wit ye well it
falleth not for you, for he must be a better knight than ye that shall
wield this shield.’</p>
<p>‘Damosel,’ said Sir Kay, ‘wit ye well I took this shield in my hands
by your leave for to behold it, not to that intent; but go wheresomever
thou wilt, for I will not go with you.’</p>
<p>Then the damosel stood still a great while and beheld many of those
knights. Then spake the knight, La Cote Male Taile:</p>
<p>‘Fair damosel, I will take the shield and that adventure upon me, so
I wist I should know whitherward my journey might be; for because I was
this day made knight I would take this adventure upon me.’</p>
<p>‘What is your name, fair young man?’ said the damosel.</p>
<p>‘My name is,’ said he, ‘La Cote Male Taile.’</p>
<p>‘Well mayest thou be called so,’ said the damosel, ‘“the knight with
the evil-shapen coat”; but and thou be so hardy to take upon thee to
bear that shield and to follow me, wit thou well thy skin shall be as
well hewn as thy coat.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said La Cote Male Taile, ‘when I am so hewn I will ask
you no salve to heal me withal.’</p>
<p>And forthwithal there came into the court two squires and brought him
great horses, and his armour, and his spears, and anon he was armed and
took his leave.</p>
<p>‘I would not by my will,’ said the king, ‘that ye took upon you that
hard adventure.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said he, ‘this adventure is mine, and the first that ever I
took upon me, and that will I follow whatsomever come of me.’</p>
<p>Then that damosel departed, and La Cote Male Taile fast followed
after. And within a while he overtook the damosel, and anon she missaid
him in the foulest manner.</p>
<p>wide-where: far and wide.</p>
