<h4 id="chapter-30">Chapter 30</h4>
<p>How Palomides demanded Queen Isoud, and how Lambegus rode after to
rescue her, and of the escape of Isoud</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Palomides, ‘I promised your Queen Isoud to bring again
Dame Bragwaine that she had lost, upon this covenant, that she should
grant me a boon that I would ask, and without grudging, other
advisement, she granted me.’</p>
<p>‘What say ye, my lady?’ said the king.</p>
<p>‘It is as he saith, so God help me,’ said the queen; ‘to say thee
sooth I promised him his asking for love and joy that I had to see
her.’</p>
<p>‘Well, madam,’ said the king, ‘and if ye were hasty to grant him what
boon he would ask, I will well that ye perform your promise.’</p>
<p>‘Then,’ said Palomides, ‘I will that ye wit that I will have your
queen to lead her and govern her whereas me list.’</p>
<p>Therewith the king stood still, and bethought him of Sir Tristram,
and deemed that he would rescue her. And then hastily the king answered,
‘Take her with the adventures that shall fall of it, for as I suppose
thou wilt not enjoy her no while.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said Palomides, ‘I dare right well abide the
adventure.’</p>
<p>And so, to make short tale, Sir Palomides took her by the hand and
said, ‘Madam, grudge not to go with me, for I desire nothing but your
own promise.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said the queen, ‘I fear not greatly to go with thee,
howbeit thou hast me at advantage upon my promise, for I doubt not I
shall be worshipfully rescued from thee.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said Sir Palomides, ‘be it as it be may.’</p>
<p>So Queen Isoud was set behind Palomides, and rode his way.</p>
<p>Anon the king sent after Sir Tristram, but in no wise he could be
found, for he was in the forest an-hunting; for that was always his
custom, but if he used arms, to chase and to hunt in the forests.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said the king, ‘now I am shamed for ever, that by mine own
assent my lady and my queen shall be devoured.’</p>
<p>Then came forth a knight, his name was Lambegus, and he was a knight
of Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>‘My lord,’ said this knight, ‘sith ye have trust in my lord, Sir
Tristram, wit ye well for his sake I will ride after your queen and
rescue her, or else I shall be beaten.’</p>
<p>‘Gramercy,’ said the king, ‘and I live, Sir Lambegus, I shall deserve
it.’</p>
<p>And then Sir Lambegus armed him, and rode after as fast as he might.
And then within a while he overtook Sir Palomides. And then Sir
Palomides left the queen.</p>
<p>‘What art thou?’ said Palomides, ‘Art thou Tristram?’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ he said, ‘I am his servant, and my name is Sir Lambegus.’</p>
<p>‘That me repenteth,’ said Palomides. ‘I had lever thou haddest been
Sir Tristram.’</p>
<p>‘I believe you well,’ said Lambegus, ‘but when thou meetest with Sir
Tristram thou shalt have thy hands full.’</p>
<p>And then they hurtled together and all to-brast their spears, and
then they pulled out their swords, and hewed on helms and hauberks. At
the last Sir Palomides gave Sir Lambegus such a wound that he fell down
like a dead knight to the earth. Then he looked after La Beale Isoud,
and then she was gone he nist where. Wit ye well Sir Palomides was never
so heavy.</p>
<p>So the queen ran into the forest, and there she found a well, and
therein she had thought to have drowned herself. And as good fortune
would, there came a knight to her that had a castle thereby, his name
was Sir Adtherp. And when he found the queen in that mischief he rescued
her, and brought her to his castle.</p>
<p>And when he wist what she was he armed him, and took his horse, and
said he would be avenged upon Palomides. And so he rode on till he met
with him, and there Sir Palomides wounded him sore, and by force he made
him to tell him the cause why he did battle with him, and how he had led
the queen unto his castle.</p>
<p>‘Now bring me there,’ said Palomides, ‘or thou shalt die of my
hands.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Adtherp, ‘I am so wounded I may not follow, but ride
you this way and it shall bring you into my castle, and there within is
the queen.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Palomides rode still till he came to the castle. And at a
window La Beale Isoud saw Sir Palomides; then she made the gates to be
shut strongly. And when he saw he might not come within the castle, he
put off his bridle and his saddle, and put his horse to pasture, and set
himself down at the gate like a man that was out of his wit that recked
not of himself.</p>
