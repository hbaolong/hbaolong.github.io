<h4 id="chapter-32">Chapter 32</h4>
<p>How Sir Gareth fought with a knight that held within his castle
thirty ladies, and how he slew him</p>
<p>So when they saw that they might not overcome him, they rode from
him, and took their counsel to slay his horse; and so they came in upon
Sir Gareth, and with spears they slew his horse, and then they assailed
him hard. But when he was on foot, there was none that he raught but he
gave him such a buffet that he did never recover. So he slew them by one
and one till they were but four, and there they fled; and Sir Gareth
took a good horse that was one of theirs, and rode his way. Then he rode
a great pace till that he came to a castle, and there he heard much
mourning of ladies and gentlewomen. So there came by him a page.</p>
<p>‘What noise is this,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘that I hear within this
castle?’</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ said the page, ‘here be within this castle thirty
ladies, and all they be widows; for here is a knight that waiteth daily
upon this castle, and his name is the Brown Knight without Pity,1 and he
is the periloust knight that now liveth; and therefore sir,’ said the
page, ‘I rede you flee.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘I will not flee though thou be afeared of
him.’</p>
<p>And then the page saw where came the Brown Knight. ‘Lo,’ said the
page, ‘yonder he cometh.’</p>
<p>‘Let me deal with him,’ said Sir Gareth.</p>
<p>And when either of other had a sight they let their horses run, and
the Brown Knight brake his spear, and Sir Gareth smote him throughout
the body, that he overthrew him to the ground stark dead. So Sir Gareth
rode into the castle, and prayed the ladies that he might repose
him.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said the ladies, ‘ye may not be lodged here.’</p>
<p>‘Make him good cheer,’ said the page, ‘for this knight hath slain
your enemy.’</p>
<p>Then they all made him good cheer as lay in their power. But wit ye
well they made him good cheer for they might none otherwise do, for they
were but poor.’</p>
<p>And so on the morn he went to mass, and there he saw the thirty
ladies kneel, and lay grovelling upon divers tombs, making great dole
and sorrow. Then Sir Gareth wist well that in the tombs lay their
lords.</p>
<p>‘Fair ladies,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘ye must at the next feast of
Pentecost be at the court of King Arthur, and say that I, Sir Gareth,
sent you thither.’</p>
<p>‘We shall do this,’ said the ladies.</p>
<p>So he departed, and by fortune he came to a mountain, and there he
found a goodly knight that bad him, ‘Abide sir knight, and joust with
me.’</p>
<p>‘What are ye?’ said Sir Gareth.</p>
<p>‘My name is,’ said he, ‘the Duke de la Rowse.’</p>
<p>‘Ah sir, ye are the same knight that I lodged once in your castle;
and there I made promise unto your lady that I should yield me unto
you.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said the duke, ‘art thou that proud knight that profferest to
fight with my knights? Therefore make thee ready, for I will have ado
with you.’</p>
<p>So they let their horses run, and there Sir Gareth smote the duke
down from his horse. But the duke lightly avoided his horse, and dressed
his shield and drew his sword, and bad Sir Gareth alight and fight with
him. So he did alight, and they did great battle together more than an
hour, and either hurt other full sore. At the last Sir Gareth gat the
duke to the earth, and would have slain him, and then he yielded him to
him.</p>
<p>‘Then must ye go,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘unto Sir Arthur my lord at the
next feast, and say that I, Sir Gareth of Orkney, sent you unto
him.’</p>
<p>‘It shall be done,’ said the duke, ‘and I will do to you homage and
fealty with an hundred knights with me; and all the days of my life to
do you service where ye will command me.’</p>
<p>raught: reached.</p>
