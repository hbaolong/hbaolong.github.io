<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>
<p>How King Arthur took a wife, and wedded Guenever, daughter to
Leodegrance, king of the land of Camelerd, with whom he had the Round
Table</p>
<p>In the beginning of Arthur, after he was chosen king by adventure and
by grace, for the most part of the barons knew not that he was Uther
Pendragon’s son, but as Merlin made it openly known, but yet many kings
and lords held great war against him for that cause, but well Arthur
overcame them all, for the most part the days of his life he was ruled
much by the counsel of Merlin. So it fell on a time King Arthur said
unto Merlin, ‘My barons will let me have no rest, but needs I must take
a wife, and I will none take but by thy counsel and by thine
advice.’</p>
<p>‘It is well done,’ said Merlin, ‘that ye take a wife, for a man of
your bounty and noblesse should not be without a wife. Now is there any
that ye love more than another?’</p>
<p>‘Yea,’ said King Arthur, ‘I love Guenever the King’s daughter
Leodegrance, of the land of Camelerd, the which holdeth in his house the
Table Round that ye told he had of my father Uther. And this damosel is
the most valiant and fairest lady that I know living, or yet that ever I
could find.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Merlin, ‘as of her beauty and fairness she is one of the
fairest alive, but and ye loved her not so well as ye do, I should find
you a damosel of beauty and of goodness that should like you and please
you, and your heart were not set; but there as a man’s heart is set, he
will be loth to return.’</p>
<p>‘That is truth,’ said King Arthur.</p>
<p>But Merlin warned the king covertly that Guenever was not wholesome
for him to take to wife, for he warned him that Launcelot should love
her, and she him again; and so he turned his tale to the adventures of
Sangrail. Then Merlin desired of the king for to have men with him that
should enquire of Guenever, and so the king granted him, and Merlin went
forth unto King Leodegrance of Camelerd, and told him of the desire of
the king that he would have unto his wife Guenever his daughter.</p>
<p>‘That is to me,’ said King Leodegrance, ‘the best tidings that ever I
heard, that so worthy a king of prowess and noblesse will wed my
daughter. And as for my lands, I will give him, wist I it might please
him, but he hath lands enow, him needeth none, but I shall send him a
gift shall please him much more, for I shall give him the Table Round,
the which Uther Pendragon gave me, and when it is full complete, there
is an hundred knights and fifty. And as for an hundred good knights I
have myself, but I fault fifty, for so many have been slain in my
days.’</p>
<p>And so Leodegrance delivered his daughter Guenever unto Merlin, and
the Table Round with the hundred knights, and so they rode freshly, with
great royalty, what by water and what by land, till that they came nigh
unto London.</p>
<p>bounty: excellence.</p>
