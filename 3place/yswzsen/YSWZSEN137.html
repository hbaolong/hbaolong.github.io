<h4 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h4>
<p>How after long fighting Beaumains overcame the knight and would have
slain him, but at the request of the lords he saved his life, and made
him to yield him to the lady</p>
<p>And then thus they fought till it was past noon, and never would
stint, till at the last they lacked wind both; and then they stood
wagging and scattering, panting, blowing and bleeding, that all that
beheld them for the most part wept for pity. So when they had rested
them a while they yede to battle again, tracing, rasing, foining as two
boars. And at some time they took their run as it had been two rams, and
hurtled together that sometime they fell grovelling to the earth; and at
sometime they were so amazed that either took other’s sword instead of
his own. Thus they endured till evensong time, that there was none that
beheld them might know whether was like to win the battle; and their
armour was so forhewen that men might see their naked sides; and in
other places they were naked, but ever the naked places they did defend.
And the Red Knight was a wily knight of war, and his wily fighting
taught Sir Beaumains to be wise; but he abought it full sore or he did
espy his fighting.</p>
<p>And thus by assent of them both they granted either other to rest;
and so they set them down upon two mole-hills there besides the fighting
place, and either of them unlaced his helm, and took the cold wind; for
either of their pages was fast by them, to come when they called to
unlace their harness and to set them on again at their commandment.</p>
<p>wagging: tottering.</p>
<p>And then when Sir Beaumains’ helm was off, he looked up to the
window, and there he saw the fair lady Dame Lyonesse, and she made him
such countenance that his heart waxed light and jolly; and therewith he
bad the Red Knight of the Red Launds make him ready, ‘and let us do the
battle to the utterance.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said the knight.</p>
<p>And then they laced up their helms, and their pages avoided, and they
stepped together and fought freshly; but the Red Knight of the Red
Launds awaited him, and at an overthwart smote him within the hand, that
his sword fell out of his hand; and yet he gave him another buffet upon
the helm that he fell grovelling to the earth, and the Red Knight fell
over him, for to hold him down.</p>
<p>Then cried the maiden Lynet on high, ‘O Sir Beaumains, where is thy
courage become? Alas, my lady my sister be-holdeth thee, and she sobbeth
and weepeth, that maketh mine heart heavy.’</p>
<p>When Sir Beaumains heard her say so, he abrayed up with a great might
and gat him upon his feet, and lightly he leapt to his sword and gripped
it in his hand, and doubled his pace unto the Red Knight, and there they
fought a new battle together. But Sir Beaumains then doubled his
strokes, and smote so thick that he smote the sword out of his hand, and
then he smote him upon the helm that he fell to the earth, and Sir
Beaumains fell upon him, and unlaced his helm to have slain him; and
then he yielded him and asked mercy, and said with a loud voice, ‘O
noble knight, I yield me to thy mercy.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Beaumains bethought him upon the knights that he had made to
be hanged shamefully, and then he said, I may not with my worship save
thy life, for the shameful deaths that thou hast caused many full good
knights to die.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the Red Knight of the Red Launds, ‘hold your hand and ye
shall know the causes why I put them to so shameful a death.’</p>
<p>‘Say on,’ said Sir Beaumains.</p>
<p>‘Sir, I loved once a lady, a fair damosel, and she had her brother
slain; and she said it was Sir Launcelot du Lake, or else Sir Gawain;
and she prayed me as that I loved her heartily, that I would make her a
promise by the faith of my knighthood, for to labour daily in arms unto
I met with one of them; and all that I might overcome I should put them
unto a villainous death; and this is the cause that I have put all these
knights to death, and so I ensured her to do all the villainy unto King
Arthur’s knights, and that I should take vengeance upon all these
knights. And, sir, now I will thee tell that every day my strength
increaseth till noon, and all this time have I seven men’s
strength.’</p>
<p>abrayed: started.</p>
