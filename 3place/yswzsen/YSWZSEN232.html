<h4 id="chapter-36">Chapter 36</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan were taken and put
in prison</p>
<p>Now will we speak of Sir Lucan the Butler, that by fortune he came
riding to the same place thereas was Sir Tristram, and in he came in
none other intent but to ask harbour. Then the porter asked what was his
name.</p>
<p>‘Tell your lord that my name is Sir Lucan, the Butler, a knight of
the Round Table.’</p>
<p>So the porter went unto Sir Darras, lord of the place, and told him
who was there to ask harbour.</p>
<p>‘Nay, nay,’ said Sir Daname, that was nephew to Sir Darras, ‘say him
that he shall not be lodged here, but let him wit that I, Sir Daname,
will met with him anon, and bid him make him ready.’</p>
<p>So Sir Daname came forth on horseback, and there they met together
with spears, and Sir Lucan smote down Sir Daname over his horse’s croup,
and then he fled into that place, and Sir Lucan rode after him, and
asked after him many times.</p>
<p>Then Sir Dinadan said to Sir Tristram, ‘It is shame to see the lord’s
cousin of this place defiled.’</p>
<p>‘Abide,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘and I shall redress it.’</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile Sir Dinadan was on horseback, and he jousted
with Lucan the Butler, and there Sir Lucan smote Dinadan through the
thick of the thigh, and so he rode his way. And Sir Tristram was wroth
that Sir Dinadan was hurt, and followed after, and thought to avenge
him; and within a while he overtook Sir Lucan, and bad him turn; and so
they met together so that Sir Tristram hurt Sir Lucan passing sore and
gave him a fall.</p>
<p>With that came Sir Uwain, a gentle knight, and when he saw Sir Lucan
so hurt he called Sir Tristram to joust with him.</p>
<p>‘Fair knight,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘tell me your name I require
you.’</p>
<p>‘Sir knight, wit ye well my name is Sir Uwain le Fise de Roi
Uriens.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘by my will I would not have ado with you at
no time.’</p>
<p>‘Ye shall not so,’ said Sir Uwain, ‘but ye shall have ado with
me.’</p>
<p>And then Sir Tristram saw none other boot, but rode against him, and
overthrew Sir Uwain and hurt him in the side, and so he departed unto
his lodging again.</p>
<p>And when Sir Dinadan understood that Sir Tristram had hurt Sir Lucan
he would have ridden after Sir Lucan for to have slain him, but Sir
Tristram would not suffer him.</p>
<p>Then Sir Uwain let ordain an horse litter, and brought Sir Lucan to
the abbey of Ganis, and the castle thereby hight the Castle of Ganis, of
the which Sir Bleoberis was lord. And at that castle Sir Launcelot
promised all his fellows to meet in the quest of Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>So when Sir Tristram was come to his lodging there came a damosel
that told Sir Darras that three of his sons were slain at that
tournament, and two grievously wounded that they were never like to help
themself. And all this was done by a noble knight that bare the black
shield, and that was he that bare the prize.</p>
<p>Then came there one and told Sir Darras that the same knight was
within, him that bare the black shield. Then Sir Darras yede unto Sir
Tristram’s chamber, and there he found his shield and showed it to the
damosel.</p>
<p>‘Ah sir,’ said the damosel, ‘that same is he that slew your three
sons.’</p>
<p>Then without any tarrying Sir Darras put Sir Tristram, and Sir
Palomides, and Sir Dinadan, within a strong prison, and there Sir
Tristram was like to have died of great sickness; and every day Sir
Palomides would reprove Sir Tristram of old hate betwixt them. And ever
Sir Tristram spake fair and said little. But when Sir Palomides saw the
falling of sickness of Sir Tristram, then was he heavy for him, and
comforted him in all the best wise he could.</p>
<p>And as the French book saith, there came forty knights to Sir Darras
that were of his own kin, and they would have slain Sir Tristram and his
two fellows, but Sir Darras would not suffer that, but kept them in
prison, and meat and drink they had.</p>
<p>So Sir Tristram endured there great pain, for sickness had undertake
him, and that is the greatest pain a prisoner may have. For all the
while a prisoner may have his health of body he may endure under the
mercy of God and in hope of good deliverance; but when sickness toucheth
a prisoner’s body, then may a prisoner say all wealth is him bereft, and
then he hath cause to wail and to weep. Right so did Sir Tristram when
sickness had undertake him, for then he took such sorrow that he had
almost slain himself.</p>
