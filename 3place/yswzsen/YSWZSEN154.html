<h4 id="chapter-34">Chapter 34</h4>
<p>How Sir Gareih acknowledged that they loved each other to King
Arthur, and of the appointment of their wedding</p>
<p>And among all these ladies she was named the fairest, and peerless.
Then when Sir Gawain saw her1 there was many a goodly look and goodly
words, that all men of worship had joy to behold them.</p>
<p>Then came King Arthur and many other kings, and Dame Guenever, and
the Queen of Orkney. And there the king asked his nephew, Sir Gareth,
whether he would have that lady as paramour, or to have her to his
wife.</p>
<p>‘My lord, wit you well that I love her above all ladies living.’</p>
<p>‘Now, fair lady,’ said King Arthur, ‘What say ye?’</p>
<p>‘Most noble king,’ said Dame Lyonesse, ‘wit you well that my lord,
Sir Gareth, is to me more lever to have and wield as my husband, than
any king or prince that is christened; and if I may not have him I
promise you I will never have none. For, my lord Arthur,’ said Dame
Lyonesse, ‘wit ye well he is my first love, and he shall be the last;
and if ye will suffer him to have his will and free choice I dare say he
will have me.’</p>
<p>‘That is truth,’ said Sir Gareth; ‘and I have not you and wield not
you as my wife, there shall never lady ne gentlewoman rejoice me.’</p>
<p>‘What, nephew,’ said the king, ‘is the wind in that door? For wit ye
well I would not for the stint of my crown to be jauser to withdraw your
hearts; and wit ye well ye cannot love so well but I shall rather
increase it than distress it. And also ye shall have my love and my
lordship in the uttermost wise that may lie in my power.’ And in the
same wise said Sir Gareth’s mother.</p>
<p>Then there was made a provision for the day of marriage; and by the
king’s advice it was provided that it should be at Michaelmas following,
at Kinkenadon by the seaside, for there is a plentiful country. And so
it was cried in all the places through the realm. And then Sir Gareth
sent his summons to all these knights and ladies that he had won in
battle tofore. that they should be at his day of marriage at Kinkenadon
by the sands.</p>
<p>And then Dame Lyonesse and the damosel Lynet with Sir Gringamore,
rode to their castle; and a goodly and a rich ring she gave to Sir
Gareth and he gave her another. And King Arthur gave her a rich bee of
gold; and so she departed.</p>
<p>And King Arthur and his fellowship rode toward Kinkenadon, and Sir
Gareth brought his lady on the way, and so came to the king again and
rode with him.</p>
<p>Lord! the great cheer that Sir Launcelot made of Sir Gareth and he of
him, for there was never no knight that Sir Gareth loved so well as he
did Sir Launcelot; and ever for the most part he would be in Sir
Launcelot’s company; for after Sir Gareth had espied Sir Gawain’s
conditions, he withdrew himself from his brother Sir Gawain’s
fellowship, for he was vengeable, and where he hated he would be avenged
with murder, and that hated Sir Gareth.</p>
<p>bee: bracelet.</p>
