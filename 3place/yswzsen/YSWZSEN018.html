<h4 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h4>
<p>Yet more of the said battle, and how it was ended by Merlin</p>
<p>When Sir Arthur and King Ban and Bors beheld them and all their
knights, they praised them much for their noble cheer of chivalry, for
the hardiest fighters that ever they heard or saw. With that, there
dressed them a forty noble knights, and said unto the three kings, they
would break their battle; these were their names: Lionses, Phariance,
Ulfius, Brastias, Ector, Kay, Lucan the Butler, Griflet le Fise de Dieu,
Moris de la Roche, Gwinas de Bloi, Brian de la Forest Savage, Bellias,
Morians of the Castle of Maidens, Flannedrius of the Castle of Ladies,
Annecians that was King Bors’ godson, a noble knight, Ladinas de la
Rouse, Emerause, Caulas, Gracian le Castlein, one Blois de la Case, and
Sir Colgrevaunce de Gore. All these knights rode on afore with spears on
their thighs, and spurred their horses mightily as the horses might run.
And the eleven kings with part of their knights rushed with their horses
as fast as they might with their spears, and there they did on both
parts marvellous deeds of arms. So came into the thick of the press,
Arthur, Ban, and Bors, and slew down, right on both hands, that their
horses went in blood up to the fetlocks. But ever the eleven kings and
their host was ever in the visage of Arthur. Wherefore Ban and Bors had
great marvel, considering the great slaughter that there was, but at the
last they were driven aback over a little river.</p>
<p>With that came Merlin on a great black horse, and said unto Arthur,
‘Thou hast never done, hast thou not done enough? Of three score
thousand this day has thou left alive but fifteen thousand, and it is
time to say “Ho!” For God is wroth with thee, that thou wilt never have
done, for yonder eleven kings at this time will not be overthrown, but
and thou tarry on them any longer, thy fortune will turn and they shall
increase. And therefore withdraw you unto your lodging, and rest you as
soon as ye may, and reward your good knights with gold and with silver,
for they have well deserved it; there may no riches be too dear for
them, for of so few men as ye have, there were never men did more of
prowess than they have done today, for ye have matched this day with the
best fighters of the world.’</p>
<p>‘That is truth,’ said King Ban and Bors.</p>
<p>‘Also,’ said Merlin, ‘withdraw you where ye list, for this three year
I dare undertake they shall not dere you; and by then ye shall hear new
tidings.’ And then Merlin said unto Arthur, ‘These eleven kings have
more on hand than they are ware of, for the Saracens are landed in their
countries, more than forty thousand, that burn and slay, and have laid
siege at the Castle Wandesborow, and make great destruction; therefore
dread you not this three year. Also, sir, all the goods that be gotten
at this battle, let it be searched, and when ye have it in your hands,
let it be given freely unto these two kings, Ban and Bors, that they may
reward their knights withal; and that shall cause strangers to be of
better will to do you service at need. Also ye be able to reward your
own knights of your own goods whensomever it liketh you.’</p>
<p>‘It is well said,’ quoth Arthur, ‘and as thou hast devised, so shall
it be done.’</p>
<p>When it was delivered to Ban and Bors, they gave the goods as freely
to their knights as freely as it was given to them. Then Merlin took his
leave of Arthur and of the two kings, for to go and see his master
Bleise, that dwelt in Northumberland; and so he departed and came to his
master, that was passing glad of his coming.</p>
<p>And there he told how Arthur and the two kings had sped at the great
battle, and how it was ended, and told the names of every king and
knight of worship that was there. And so Bleise wrote the battle word by
word, as Merlin told him how it began, and by whom, and in likewise how
it was ended, and who had the worse. All the battles that were done in
Arthur’s days, Merlin did his master Bleise do write; also he did do
write all the battles that every worthy knight did of Arthur’s
court.</p>
<p>After this Merlin departed from his master and came to King Arthur,
that was in the Castle of Bedegraine, that was one of the castles that
standen in the Forest of Sherwood. And Merlin was so disguised that King
Arthur knew him not, for he was all befurred in black sheep skins, and a
great pair of boots, and a bow and arrows, in a russet gown, and brought
wild geese in his hand, and it was on the morn after Candlemas day; but
King Arthur knew him not.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Merlin unto the king, ‘will ye give me a gift?’</p>
<p>‘Wherefore,’ said King Arthur, ‘should I give thee a gift,
churl?’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Merlin, ‘ye were better to give me a gift that is not in
your hand than to lose great riches, for here in the same place there
the great battle was, is great treasure hid in the earth.’</p>
<p>‘Who told thee so, churl?’ said Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Merlin told me so,’ said he.</p>
<p>Then Ulfius and Brastias knew him well enough, and smiled. ‘Sir,’
said these two knights, ‘it is Merlin that so speaketh unto you.’</p>
<p>Then King Arthur was greatly abashed, and had marvel of Merlin, and
so had King Ban and King Bors, and so they had great disport at him.</p>
<p>So in the meanwhile there came a damosel that was an earl’s daughter:
his name was Sanam, and her name was Lionors, a passing fair damosel;
and so she came thither for to do homage, as other lords did after the
great battle. And King Arthur set his love greatly upon her, and so did
she upon him, and the king had ado with her, and gat on her a child: his
name was Borre, that was after a good knight, and of the Table
Round.</p>
<p>Then there came word that the King Rience of North Wales made great
war on King Leodegrance of Camelerd, for the which thing Arthur was
wroth, for he loved him well, and hated King Rience, for he was alway
against him. So by ordinance of the three kings that were sent home unto
Benwick, all they would depart for dread of King Claudas: and Phariance,
and Antemes, and Gracian, and Lionses of Payarne, with the leaders of
those that should keep the king’s lands.</p>
<p>cheer: appearance.</p>
<p>did his master Bleise do write: told his master Bleise to write.</p>
<p>shall not dere you: shall not harm you.</p>
<p>damosel: maiden.</p>
