<h4 id="chapter-14">Chapter 14</h4>
<p>How Balin met with that knight named Garlon at a feast, and there he
slew him to have his blood to heal therewith the son of his host</p>
<p>Then they rode three or four days and never met with adventure, and
by hap they were lodged with a gentleman that was a rich man and well at
ease. And as they sat at their supper Balin heard one1 complain
grievously by him in a chair.</p>
<p>‘What is this noise?’ said Balin.</p>
<p>‘Forsooth,’ said his host, ‘I will tell you. I was but late at a
jousting, and there I jousted with a knight that is brother unto King
Pellam, and twice smote I him down, and then he promised to quit me on
my best friend; and so he wounded my son, that cannot be whole till I
have of that knight’s blood, and he rideth alway invisible, but I know
not his name.’</p>
<p>‘Ah!’ said Balin, ‘I know that knight, his name is Garlon, he hath
slain two knights of mine in the same manner, therefore I had lever meet
with that knight than all the gold in this realm, for the despite he
hath done me.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said his host, ‘I shall tell you, King Pellam of Listinoise
hath made do cry in all this country a great feast that shall be within
these twenty days, and no knight may come there but if he bring his wife
with him, or his paramour; and that knight, your enemy and mine, ye
shall see that day.’</p>
<p>‘Then I behote you,’ said Balin, ‘part of his blood to heal your son
withal.’</p>
<p>‘We will be forward to-morn,’ said his host.</p>
<p>So on the morn they rode all three toward Pellam, and they had
fifteen days’ journey or they came thither; and that same day began the
great feast. And so they alit and stabled their horses, and went into
the castle; but Balin’s host might not be let in because he had no
lady.</p>
<p>Then Balin was well received and brought unto a chamber and unarmed
him, and there were brought him robes to his pleasure, and would have
had Balin leave his sword behind him.</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Balin, ‘that do I not, for it is the custom of my country
a knight always to keep his weapon with him, and that custom will I
keep, or else I will depart as I came.’ Then they gave him leave to wear
his sword, and so he went unto the castle, and was set among knights of
worship, and his lady afore him.</p>
<p>Soon Balin asked a knight, ‘Is there not a knight in this court whose
name is Garlon?’</p>
<p>‘Yonder he goeth,’ said a knight, ‘he with the black face; he is the
marvellest knight that is now living, for he destroyeth many good
knights, for he goeth invisible.’</p>
<p>‘Ah well,’ said Balin, ‘is that he?’ Then Balin advised him long: ‘If
I slay him here I shall not scape, and if I leave him now, peradventure
I shall never meet with him again at such a Steven and much harm he will
do and he live.’</p>
<p>Therewith this Garlon espied that this Balin beheld him, and then he
came and smote Balin on the face with the back of his hand, and said,
‘Knight, why beholdest thou me so? For shame therefore, eat thy meat and
do that thou came for.’</p>
<p>‘Thou sayest sooth,’ said Balin, ‘this is not the first despite that
thou hast done me, and therefore I will do that I came for,’ and rose up
fiercely and clave his head to the shoulders. ‘Give me the truncheon,’
said Balin to his lady, ‘wherewith he slew your knight.’ Anon she gave
it him, for alway she bare the truncheon with her. And therewith Balin
smote him through the body, and said openly, ‘With that truncheon thou
hast slain a good knight, and now it sticketh in thy body.’</p>
<p>And then Balin called unto him his host, saying, ‘Now may ye fetch
blood enough to heal your son withal.’</p>
<p>behote: promise.</p>
<p>advised him: considered to himself. steven: occasion.</p>
