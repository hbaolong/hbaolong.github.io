<h4 id="chapter-43">Chapter 43</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram at a tournament bare the shield that Morgan le Fay
delivered to him</p>
<p>Then the King of Scots and the King of Ireland held against King
Arthur’s knights, and there began a great medley.</p>
<p>So came in Sir Tristram and did marvellous deeds of arms, for there
he smote down many knights. And ever he was afore King Arthur with that
shield. And when King Arthur saw that shield he marvelled greatly in
what intent it was made; but Queen Guenever deemed as it was, wherefore
she was heavy.</p>
<p>Then was there a damosel of Queen Morgan in a chamber by King Arthur,
and when she heard King Arthur speak of that shield, then she spake
openly unto King Arthur:</p>
<p>‘Sir King, wit ye well this shield was ordained for you, to warn you
of your shame and dishonour, and that longeth to you and your
queen.’</p>
<p>And then anon that damosel picked her away privily, that no man wist
where she was become. Then was King Arthur sad and wroth, and asked from
whence came that damosel. There was not one that knew her nor wist where
she was become.</p>
<p>Then Queen Guenever called to her Sir Ector de Maris, and there she
made her complaint to him, and said, ‘I wot well this shield was made by
Morgan le Fay in despite of me and of Sir Launcelot, wherefore I dread
me sore lest I should be destroyed.’</p>
<p>And ever the King beheld Sir Tristram, that did so marvellous deeds
of arms that he wondered sore what knight he might be, and well he wist
it was not Sir Launcelot. And it was told him that Sir Tristram was in
Petit Britain with Isoud la Blanche Mains, for he deemed, and he had
been in the realm of Logris, Sir Launcelot or some of his fellows that
were in the quest of Sir Tristram that they should have found him or
that time. So King Arthur had marvel what knight he might be. And ever
Sir Arthur’s eye was on that shield. All that espied the queen, and that
made her sore afeared.</p>
<p>Then ever Sir Tristram smote down knights wonderly to behold, what
upon the right hand and upon the left hand, that unnethe no knight might
withstand him. And the King of Scots and the King of Ireland began to
withdraw them. When Arthur espied that, he thought that that knight with
the strange shield should not escape him. Then he called unto him Sir
Uwain le Blanchemains, and bad him arm him and make him ready.</p>
<p>So anon King Arthur and Sir Uwain dressed them before Sir Tristram,
and required him to tell them where he had that shield.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ he said, ‘I had it of Queen Morgan le Fay, sister unto King
Arthur.’</p>
<p>So here endeth this history of</p>
<p>this book, for it is the first</p>
<p>book of Sir Tristram de</p>
<p>Liones, and the second</p>
<p>book of Sir Tristram</p>
<p>followeth.</p>
<p>picked: went</p>
<p>Editor’s Note</p>
<p>The text is based on Caxton’s printed edition of 1485. The syntax of
the original has been left unchanged, but the spelling has been
modernized. Archaic forms have usually been kept, although some minor
alterations have been made, as, e.g., in rendering hem (3rd person
plural pronoun) as them, and in the past tenses of a few verbs. Obsolete
words are explained in the Glossary and incorporate the same minor
spelling changes as are made regularly elsewhere. Caxton’s spellings of
proper names have been harmonized. Modern punctuation and paragraphing
have been used.</p>
<p>In commenting in the Notes on difficult points, I have occasionally
referred to the readings of the Winchester Manuscript, which has been
edited by Professor E. Vinaver as The Works of Sir Thomas Malory,
Oxford, 1967 (second edition). My thanks are due to the Clarendon Press
for permission to quote from this edition, to which I am greatly
indebted. My thanks are also due to the Pierpont Morgan Library and the
John Rylands Library for supplying microfilms of the two extant copies
of Caxton’s edition.</p>
<p>JANET COWEN</p>
<p>Notes to Volume I</p>
<h4 id="abbreviations">ABBREVIATIONS</h4>
<p>C. Caxton’s edition.</p>
<p>W. Winchester Manuscript.</p>
<p>PREFACE</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Godfrey of Bouillon: a leader in the first crusade, who became
ruler of Jerusalem.</p></li>
<li><p>Polichronicon: a Latin historical work of Ranulf Higden
(d. 1364), a Benedictine monk. An English version by John Trevisa was
published by Caxton in 1482.</p></li>
<li><p>Galfridus in his British book: Geoffrey of Monmouth’s History of
the Kings of Britain, written c. 1135.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>BOOK I</p>
<p>ch. 4 1. At this point nobody except Uther and Merlin know who Arthur
is.</p>
<p>ch. 7 1. Malory refers to Arthur’s knights as ‘of the Round Table’,
although Arthur has not yet been presented with the Round Table
(cf. Book III, ch. 1). Probably he did this out of habit.</p>
<p>ch. 9 1. According to Malory’s later account (Book I. ch. 25)
Excalibur is also the name of the sword which Arthur receives from the
Lady of the Lake.</p>
<p>ch. 10 1. C: do.</p>
<p>ch. 11 1. he refers to Arthur.</p>
<p>ch. 15 1. Moris de la Roche nevertheless reappears later in the
fighting (cf. ch. 17). For an explanation of how the reading here could
have arisen from textual corruption, see Vinaver, p. 1292, n. 8–9.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>C: ‘one of the best knights’.</p></li>
<li><p>Bleoberis. This character is apparently distinct from Bleoberis
de Ganis. He does not reappear.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>ch. 20 1. The sense is obviously defective here. A better reading is
found in W: ‘but and I might prove it, I would wit whether thou were
better …’</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>How Ulfius and Brasias got to know about Arthur’s origins is not
explained.</li>
</ol>
<p>ch. 23 1. C: ‘the mights’.</p>
<p>id=“page_470“&gt;BOOK II</p>
<p>ch. 4 1. C: ‘said Balin’.</p>
<p>ch. 6 1. C: ‘came ride’.</p>
<p>ch. 141. C: ouer; W: one.</p>
<p>ch. 151. Malory later implies (ch. 8) that Balin carries two swords,
but this is not assumed here. Malory has probably taken ‘Knight with the
Two Swords’ literally where it is meant to be a title. See Vinaver.
pp. 1315. n. 84. 29–30, and 1321, n. 89. 10–11.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>W. has the less startling and obviously better reading: ‘and for the
most party of that castle was dead through the dolorous stroke. Right so
lay King Pellam and Balin three days.’ See Vinaver, p. 1317, n. 85.
13–15.</li>
</ol>
<p>ch. 161. And King Pellam …dole, tray and tene. This passage does not
appear in any of Malory’s known sources. It is imperfectly harmonized
with the later account of the Grail story. Galahad, son of Launcelot, is
here confused with Galahaut the Haut Prince; cf. Book XIII, ch. 4, and
Book XVII, ch. 1.</p>
<p>ch. 191. cf. ch. 16. n. 1.</p>
<p>BOOK III</p>
<p>ch. 2 1. twenty and eight knights. This should be forty-eight,
leaving the two vacant seats which Arthur remarks on (Book III,
ch. 4).</p>
<p>ch. 10 1. C: ‘and’.</p>
<p>ch. 12 1. Hontzlake of Wentland is distinct from Ontzlake, who plays
a prominent part in the episode of Arthur and Accolon in Book IV.</p>
<p>ch. 13 1. Brian of the Isles as described here does not seem
consistent with the warlike character Brian de les Isles who appears as
the enemy of Arthur in Book IX, ch. 6. Probably the two are meant to be
distinct.</p>
<p>ch. 15 1. The passage which follows is an original passage of
Malory’s, notable for its outline of knightly behaviour. In place of
always to do ladies, damosels and gentlewomen succour, upon pain of
death, W. has: strengthe hem in hir ryghtes, and never to enforce
them.</p>
<p>BOOK IV</p>
<p>ch. 5 1. a branch of an holy herb. Vinaver (p. 1342, n. 132. 14–17)
has shown how this rather puzzling reference could be due to Malory’s
mistaking of the word branke, used in his source in the literary sense
of a subdivision of a cycle of stories.</p>
<p>ch. 15 1. armyvestal. This word does not occur elsewhere, and the
sense can only be conjectured from the context. It may be intended to
mean ‘warlike’, and could be an attempt to make sense of W.’s equally
obscure amyvestyall.</p>
<p>ch. 17 1. certain cause not in C.</p>
<p>ch. 20 1. C: make.</p>
<p>ch. 24 1. knight of the Table Round. However, Marhaus has not yet
been made a knight of the Round Table. Cf. Book IV, ch. 28.</p>
<p>ch. 28 1. This mistaken assertion may be the result of confusion of
Pelleas and King Pelles.</p>
<p>BOOK V</p>
<p>The source for this part of the story is the English alliterative
poem Morte Arthure. Caxton has considerably reduced the alliterative
cadence.</p>
<p>ch. 2 1. Cateland: Catalonia. Not all place-names in the account of
Arthur’s campaign which follow are capable of identification, and the
forms of some have obviously arisen through misunderstanding.</p>
<p>ch. 3 1. Baudwin and Constantine are two characters created by Malory
to replace Mordred, who in other versions of the story is here appointed
as Arthur’s deputy. But Malory keeps the story of Mordred’s treachery
until the final book.</p>
<p>ch. 12 1. Pleasance: Placenza; Petersaint: possibly Pietrasanta; Port
of Tremble: Pontremoli.</p>
<p>BOOK VI</p>
<p>ch. 4 1. white monks: Cistercians.</p>
<p>ch. 10 1. adventurous or lecherous. The two adjectives are clearly
incongruous. The reading in W. showss that there must have been
confusion with the word advoutrers (‘adulterers’). See Vinaver, p. 1421,
n. 270. 34–36.</p>
<p>ch. 13 1. C: ‘he’.</p>
<p>ch. 16 1. rownsepyk. No satisfactory explanation of this form has
been suggested. It is best explained as a corruption of W.’s rowgh spyke
(‘rough spike’).</p>
<p>BOOK VII</p>
<p>ch. 2 1. The story of ‘La Cote Male Taile’ is told in Book IX.</p>
<p>ch. 7 1. C: merueylled.</p>
<p>ch. 9 1. Wade. The legend of Wade, a famous hero of antiquity, is
mentioned by many medieval writers, including Chaucer (Merchant’s Tale,
1424.). In Scandinavian writings he appears as a giant, the father of
Wayland.</p>
<p>Tristram is here referred to as a grown man. An account of his birth
and early life appears later, at the beginning of Book VIII.</p>
<p>ch. 15 1. C: encreased.</p>
<p>ch. 20 1. C: ‘of Sir Gawain’.</p>
<p>ch. 22 1. C: Syr.</p>
<p>ch. 26 1. W: ‘And if so be that he be a wedded man that wins the
degree he shall have a coronal of gold.’ C.’s variant is probably due to
a misreading, since the ‘degree’ at a tournament would only be awarded
to a knight. See Vinaver, p. 1438, n. 341. 22–4.</p>
<p>ch. 27 1. himself refers to ‘beauty’.</p>
<p>ch. 28 1. encountered not in C.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>C: ‘Launcelot’.</p></li>
<li><p>C: ‘Green’.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>ch. 32 1. The Brown Knight Without Pity, who meets his death here, is
clearly identical with Breunis Saunce Pité, who appears in later books.
Cf. notes to Book VII, chs. 2 and 9 above.</p>
<p>ch. 34 1. W: ‘Sir Gareth met with her’.</p>
<p>BOOK VIII</p>
<p>ch. 1 1. wife not in C.</p>
<p>ch. 12 1. C: ‘he that’.</p>
<p>ch. 16 1. keep not in C.</p>
<p>ch. 17 1. C.’s ‘where ye beat’ is not consistent with the previous
account of the tournament in Book VIII, chs. 9 and 10. W: he.</p>
<p>ch. 24 1. In making Isoud’s mother give the potion to Isoud herself,
C. has creaed a strange inconsistency, since thte episode which followes
clearly depends on Isoud’s being unaware of the magic power of the
potion. The mistake has probably arisen from a misunderstanding. In W.
the sense is clear: ‘then the queen Isode’s mother gave Dame Grangwaine
unto her to be her gentlewoman, and also she and Gouvernaile had a drink
of he queen and she charged them …’ See Vinaver, p. 1462, n. 411.
35–412. 2.</p>
<p>ch. 25 1. C: ‘mine’.</p>
<p>ch. 28 1. C: a gyaunt that fought: an obviously corrupt reading. See
Vinaver, p. 1463, n. 418. 13. W. has whyche instead of that, and Vinaver
suggests as the original reading whyght (‘mighty’).</p>
<p>BOOK I</p>
<p>Xch. 22 1. them pass not in C.</p>
<p>ch. 25 1. W: ‘said Sir Gawain’.</p>
<p>ch. 35 1. C: Tristram.</p>
