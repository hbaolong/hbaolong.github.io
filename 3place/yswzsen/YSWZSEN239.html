<h4 id="chapter-43">Chapter 43</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram at a tournament bare the shield that Morgan le Fay
delivered to him</p>
<p>Then the King of Scots and the King of Ireland held against King
Arthur’s knights, and there began a great medley.</p>
<p>So came in Sir Tristram and did marvellous deeds of arms, for there
he smote down many knights. And ever he was afore King Arthur with that
shield. And when King Arthur saw that shield he marvelled greatly in
what intent it was made; but Queen Guenever deemed as it was, wherefore
she was heavy.</p>
<p>Then was there a damosel of Queen Morgan in a chamber by King Arthur,
and when she heard King Arthur speak of that shield, then she spake
openly unto King Arthur:</p>
<p>‘Sir King, wit ye well this shield was ordained for you, to warn you
of your shame and dishonour, and that longeth to you and your
queen.’</p>
<p>And then anon that damosel picked her away privily, that no man wist
where she was become. Then was King Arthur sad and wroth, and asked from
whence came that damosel. There was not one that knew her nor wist where
she was become.</p>
<p>Then Queen Guenever called to her Sir Ector de Maris, and there she
made her complaint to him, and said, ‘I wot well this shield was made by
Morgan le Fay in despite of me and of Sir Launcelot, wherefore I dread
me sore lest I should be destroyed.’</p>
<p>And ever the King beheld Sir Tristram, that did so marvellous deeds
of arms that he wondered sore what knight he might be, and well he wist
it was not Sir Launcelot. And it was told him that Sir Tristram was in
Petit Britain with Isoud la Blanche Mains, for he deemed, and he had
been in the realm of Logris, Sir Launcelot or some of his fellows that
were in the quest of Sir Tristram that they should have found him or
that time. So King Arthur had marvel what knight he might be. And ever
Sir Arthur’s eye was on that shield. All that espied the queen, and that
made her sore afeared.</p>
<p>Then ever Sir Tristram smote down knights wonderly to behold, what
upon the right hand and upon the left hand, that unnethe no knight might
withstand him. And the King of Scots and the King of Ireland began to
withdraw them. When Arthur espied that, he thought that that knight with
the strange shield should not escape him. Then he called unto him Sir
Uwain le Blanchemains, and bad him arm him and make him ready.</p>
<p>So anon King Arthur and Sir Uwain dressed them before Sir Tristram,
and required him to tell them where he had that shield.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ he said, ‘I had it of Queen Morgan le Fay, sister unto King
Arthur.’</p>
<p>So here endeth this history of</p>
<p>this book, for it is the first</p>
<p>book of Sir Tristram de</p>
<p>Liones, and the second</p>
<p>book of Sir Tristram</p>
<p>followeth.</p>
<p>picked: went</p>
<p>Editor’s Note</p>
<p>The text is based on Caxton’s printed edition of 1485. The syntax of
the original has been left unchanged, but the spelling has been
modernized. Archaic forms have usually been kept, although some minor
alterations have been made, as, e.g., in rendering hem (3rd person
plural pronoun) as them, and in the past tenses of a few verbs. Obsolete
words are explained in the Glossary and incorporate the same minor
spelling changes as are made regularly elsewhere. Caxton’s spellings of
proper names have been harmonized. Modern punctuation and paragraphing
have been used.</p>
<p>In commenting in the Notes on difficult points, I have occasionally
referred to the readings of the Winchester Manuscript, which has been
edited by Professor E. Vinaver as The Works of Sir Thomas Malory,
Oxford, 1967 (second edition). My thanks are due to the Clarendon Press
for permission to quote from this edition, to which I am greatly
indebted. My thanks are also due to the Pierpont Morgan Library and the
John Rylands Library for supplying microfilms of the two extant copies
of Caxton’s edition.</p>
