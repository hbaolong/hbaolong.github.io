<h4 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h4>
<p>How that knight slew his love and a knight lying by her, and after,
how he slew himself with his own sword, and how Balin rode toward a
castle where he lost his life</p>
<p>And when Garnish beheld her so lying, for pure sorrow his mouth and
nose brast out on bleeding, and with his sword he smote off both their
heads, and then he made sorrow out of measure, and said, ‘O Balin, much
sorrow hast thou brought unto me, for haddest thou not showed me that
sight I should have passed my sorrow.’</p>
<p>‘Forsooth,’ said Balin, ‘I did it to this intent that it should
better thy courage, and that ye might see and know her falsehood, and to
cause you to leave love of such a lady; God knoweth I did none other but
as I would ye did to me.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Garnish, ‘now is my sorrow double that I may not endure,
now have I slain that I most loved in all my life;’ and therewith
suddenly he rove himself on his own sword unto the hilts.</p>
<p>When Balin saw that, he dressed him thenceward, lest folk would say
he had slain them; and so he rode forth, and within three days he came
by a cross, and thereon were letters of gold written, that said, IT IS
NOT FOR NO KNIGHT ALONE TO RIDE TOWARD THIS CASTLE.</p>
<p>Then saw he an old hoar gentleman coming toward him, that said,
‘Balin le Savage, thou passest thy bounds to come this way, therefore
turn again and it will avail thee.’ And he vanished away anon; and so he
heard an horn blow as it had been the death of a beast. ‘That blast,’
said Balin, ‘is blown for me, for I am the prize and yet am I not
dead.’</p>
<p>Anon withal he saw an hundred ladies and many knights, that welcomed
him with fair semblant, and made him passing good cheer unto his sight,
and led him into the castle, and there was dancing and minstrelsy and
all manner of joy. Then the chief lady of the castle said, ‘Knight with
the Two Swords, ye must have ado and joust with a knight hereby that
keepeth an island, for there may no man pass this way, but he must joust
or he pass.’</p>
<p>‘That is an unhappy custom,’ said Balin, ‘that a knight may not pass
this way but if he joust.’</p>
<p>‘Ye shall not have ado but with one knight,’ said the lady.</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Balin, ‘since I shall, thereto I am ready, but
travelling men are oft weary and their horses too; but though my horse
be weary my heart is not weary. I would be fain there my death should
be.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said a knight to Balin, ‘methinketh your shield is not good, I
will lend you a bigger, thereof I pray you.’</p>
<p>And so he took the shield that was unknown and left his own, and so
rode unto the island, and put him and his horse in a great boat; and
when he came on the other side he met with a damosel, and she said, ‘O
knight Balin, why have ye left your own shield? Alas ye have put
yourself in great danger, for by your shield ye should have been known;
it is great pity of you as ever was of knight, for of thy prowess and
hardiness thou hast no fellow living.’</p>
<p>‘Me repenteth,’ said Balin, ‘that ever I came within this country,
but I may not turn now again for shame, and what adventure shall fall to
me, be it life or death, I will take the adventure that shall come to
me.’ And then he looked on his armour, and understood he was well armed,
and therewith blessed him and mounted upon his horse.</p>
