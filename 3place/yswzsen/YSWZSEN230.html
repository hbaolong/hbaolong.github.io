<h4 id="chapter-34">Chapter 34</h4>
<p>How the prize of the third day was given to Sir Launcelot, and how
Sir Launcelot gave it to Sir Tristram</p>
<p>Then all the estates and degrees high and low said of Sir Launcelot
great worship, for the honour that he did unto Sir Tristram; and for
that honour doing to Sir Tristram he was at that time more praised and
renowned than and he had overthrown five hundred knights; and all the
people wholly for this gentleness, first the estates both high and low,
and after the commonalty, cried at once, ‘Sir Launcelot hath won the
field whosoever say nay.’</p>
<p>Then was Sir Launcelot wroth and ashamed, and so there-withal he rode
to King Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said the king, ‘we are all dismayed that Sir Tristram is thus
departed from us. By God,’ said King Arthur, ‘he is one of the noblest
knights that ever I saw hold spear or sword in hand, and the most
courteous knight in his fighting; for full hard I saw him,’ said King
Arthur, ‘when he smote Sir Palomides upon the helm thrice, that he
abashed his helm with his strokes, and also he said, “Here is a stroke
for Sir Tristram,” and thus thrice he said.’</p>
<p>Then King Arthur, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Dodinas le Savage took their
horses to seek Sir Tristram, and by the means of Sir Persides he had
told King Arthur where Sir Tristram was in his pavilion. But when they
came there, Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan were gone. Then King Arthur and
Sir Launcelot were heavy, and returned again to the Castle of Maidens
making great dole for the hurt of Sir Tristram, and his sudden
departing.</p>
<p>‘So God me help,’ said King Arthur, ‘I am more heavy that I cannot
meet with him than for all the hurts that all my knights have had at the
tournament.’</p>
<p>Right so came Sir Gaheris and told King Arthur how Sir Tristram had
smitten down Sir Palomides, and it was at Sir Palomides’ own
request.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said King Arthur, ‘that was great dishonour to Sir Palomides,
in as much as Sir Tristram was sore wounded, and now may we all, kings
and knights, and men of worship, say that Sir Tristram may be called a
noble knight, and one of the best knights that ever I saw the days of my
life. For I will that ye all, kings and knights, know,’ said King
Arthur, ‘that I never saw knight do so marvellously as he hath done
these three days; for he was the first that began and that longest held
on, save this last day. And though he was hurt, it was a manly adventure
of two noble knights, and when two noble men encounter, needs must the
one have the worse, like as God will suffer at that time.’</p>
<p>‘As for me,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘for all the lands that ever my
father left me I would not have hurt Sir Tristram and I had known him at
that time; that I hurt him was for I saw not his shield. For and I had
seen his black shield, I would not have meddled with him for many
causes: for late he did as much for me as ever did knight, and that is
well known that he had ado with thirty knights, and no help save Sir
Dinadan. And one thing shall I promise,’ said Sir Launcelot, ‘Sir
Palomides shall repent it as in his unkindly dealing for to follow that
noble knight that I by mishap hurted thus.’ Sir Launcelot said all the
worship that might be said by Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>Then King Arthur made a great feast to all that would come. And thus
we let pass King Arthur, and a little we will turn unto Sir Palomides,
that after he had a fall of Sir Tristram, he was nigh hand araged out of
his wit for despite of Sir Tristram. And so he followed him by
adventure. And as he came by a river, in his woodness he would have made
his horse to have leapt over; and the horse failed footing and fell in
the river, wherefore Sir Palomides was adread lest he should have been
drowned; and then he avoided his horse, and swam to the land, and let
his horse go down by adventure.</p>
