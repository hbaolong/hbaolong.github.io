<h4 id="chapter-21">Chapter 21</h4>
<p>How Ulfius apeached Queen Igraine, Arthur’s mother, of treason; and
how a knight came and desired to have the death of his master
revenged</p>
<p>Right so came Ulfius, and said openly that the king and all might
hear that wer efeasted that day, ‘Ye are the falsest lady of the world,
and the most traitress unto the king’s person.’</p>
<p>‘Beware,’ said Arhur, ‘what thou sayest; thou speakest a great
word.’</p>
<p>‘I am well ware,’ said Ulfius, ‘what I speak, and here is my glove to
prove it upon any man that will say the contrary, that this Queen
Igraine is causer of your great damage, and of your great war. For, and
she would have uttered it in the life of King Uther Pendragon, of the
birth of you, and how ye were begotten, ye had never had the mortal wars
that ye have had; for the most part of your barons of your realm knew
never whose son ye were, nor of whom ye were begotten; and she that bare
you of her body should have made it known openly in excusing of her
worship and yours, and in likewise to all the realm, wherefore I prove
her false to God and to you and to all your realm, and who will say the
contrary I will prove it on his body.’</p>
<p>Then spake Igraine and said, ‘I am a woman and I may not fight, but
rather than I should be dishonoured, there would some good man take my
quarrel. More,’ she said, ‘Merlin knoweth well, and ye Sir Ulfius, how
King Uther came to me in the Castle of Tintagel in the likeness of my
lord, that was dead three hours tofore, and thereby gat a child that
night upon me. And after the thirteenth day King Uther wedded me, and by
his commandment when the child was born it was delivered unto Merlin and
nourished by him, and so I saw the child never after, nor wot not what
is his name, for I knew him never yet.’</p>
<p>And there Ulfius said to the queen, ‘Merlin is more to blame than
ye.’</p>
<p>‘Well I wot,’ said the queen, ‘I bare a child by my lord King Uther,
but I wot not where he is become.’</p>
<p>Then Merlin took the king by the hand, saying, ‘This is your mother.’
And therewith Sir Ector bare witness how he nourished him by Uther’s
commandment. And therewith King Arthur took his mother, Queen Igraine,
in his arms and kissed her, and either wept upon other. And then the
king let make a feast that lasted eight days.</p>
<p>Then on a day there come in the court a squire on horseback, leading
a knight before him wounded to the death, and told him how there was a
knight in the forest had reared up a pavilion by a well, ‘and hath slain
my master, a good knight, his name was Miles; wherefore I beseech you
that my master may be buried, and that some knight may revenge my
master’s death.’ Then the noise was great of that knight’s death in the
court, and every man said his advice.</p>
<p>Then came Griflet that was but a squire, and he was but young, of the
age of the King Arthur, so he besought the king for all his service that
he had done him, to give him the order of knighthood.</p>
