<h4 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h4>
<p>How King Arthur had a battle against Nero and King Lot of Orkney, and
how King Lot was deceived by Merlin, and how twelve kings were slain</p>
<p>Then King Arthur made ready his host in ten battles, and Nero was
ready in the field afore the Castle Terrabil with a great host, and he
had ten battles, with many more people than Arthur had. Then Nero had
the vanguard with the most part of his people. And Merlin came to King
Lot of the Isle of Orkney, and held him with a tale of prophecy, till
Nero and his people were destroyed. And there Sir Kay the Seneschal did
passingly well, that the days of his life the worship went never from
him; and Sir Hervis de Revel did marvellous deeds with King Arthur, and
King Arthur slew that day twenty knights and maimed forty. At that time
came in the Knight with the Two Swords and his brother Balan, but they
two did so marvellously that the king and all the knights marvelled of
them, and all they that beheld them said they were sent from heaven as
angels, or devils from hell; and King Arthur said himself they were the
best knights that ever he saw, for they gave such strokes that all men
had wonder of them.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile came one to King Lot, and told him while he tarried
there Nero was destroyed and slain with all his people.</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said King Lot, ‘I am ashamed, for by my default there is many
a worshipful man slain, for and we had been together there had been none
host under the heaven that had been able for to have matched with us;
this faiter with his prophecy hath mocked me.’</p>
<p>(All that did Merlin, for he knew well that and King Lot had been
with his body there at the first battle, King Arthur had been slain, and
all his people destroyed; and well Merlin knew the one of the kings
should be dead that day, and loth was Merlin that any of them both
should be slain; but of the twain, he had lever King Lot had been slain
than King Arthur.)</p>
<p>‘Now what is best to do?’ said King Lot of Orkney. ‘Whether is me
better to treat with King Arthur or to fight, for the greater part of
our people are slain and destroyed?’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said a knight, ‘set on Arthur for they are weary and
forfoughten and we be fresh.’</p>
<p>‘As for me,’ said King Lot, ‘I would every knight would do his part
as I would do mine.’</p>
<p>And then they advanced banners and smote together and all to-shivered
their spears; and Arthur’s knights, with the help of the Knight with the
Two Swords and his brother Balan put King Lot and his host to the worse.
But always King Lot held him in the foremost front, and did marvellous
deeds of arms, for all his host was borne up by his hands, for he abode
all knights. Alas he might not endure, the which was great pity, that so
worthy a knight as he was one should be overmatched, that of late time
afore had been a knight of King Arthur’s, and wedded the sister of King
Arthur; and for King Arthur lay by King Lot’s wife, the which was
Arthur’s sister, and gat on her Mordred, therefore King Lot held against
Arthur.</p>
<p>So there was a knight that was called the Knight with the Strange
Beast, and at that time his right name was called Pellinor, the which
was a good man of prowess, and he smote a mighty stroke at King Lot as
he fought with all his enemies, and he failed of his stroke, and smote
the horse’s neck, that he fell to the ground with King Lot; and
therewith anon Pellinor smote him a great stroke through the helm and
head unto the brows. And then all the host of Orkney fled for the death
of King Lot, and there were slain many mothers’ sons. But King Pellinor
bare the wite of the death of King Lot, wherefore Sir Gawain revenged
the death of his father the tenth year after he was made knight, and
slew King Pellinor with his own hands.</p>
<p>Also there were slain at that battle twelve kings on the side of King
Lot with Nero, and all were buried in the Church of Saint Stephen’s in
Camelot, and the remnant of knights and of other were buried in a great
rock.</p>
<p>faiter: imposter. forfoughten: wearied with fighting.</p>
