<h4 id="chapter-40">Chapter 40</h4>
<p>How Sir Dinadan rescued a lady from Sir Breunis Saunce Pitè, andhow
Sir Tristram received a shield of Morgan le Fay</p>
<p>So as Sir Dinadan rode by a well he found a lady making great
dole.</p>
<p>‘What aileth you?’ said Sir Dinadan.</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ said the lady, ‘I am the woefullest lady of the world,
for within these five days here came a knight called Sir Breunis Saunce
Pitè, and he slew mine own brother, and ever since he hath kept me at
his own will, and of all men in the world I hate him most; and therefore
I require you of knighthood to avenge me, for he will not tarry, but be
here anon.’</p>
<p>‘Let him come,’ said Sir Dinadan, ‘and because of honour of all women
I will do my part.’</p>
<p>With this came Sir Breunis, and when he saw a knight with his lady he
was wood wroth. And then he said, ‘Sir Knight, keep thee from me!’</p>
<p>So they hurled together as thunder, and either smote other passing
sore, but Sir Dinadan put him through the shoulder a grievous wound, and
or ever Sir Dinadan might turn him Sir Breunis was gone and fled.</p>
<p>Then the lady prayed him to bring her to a castle there beside but
four mile thence; and so Sir Dinadan brought her there, and she was
welcome, for the lord of that castle was her uncle. And so Sir Dinadan
rode his way upon his adventure.</p>
<p>Now turn we this tale unto Sir Tristram, that by adventure he came to
a castle to ask lodging, wherein was Queen Morgan le Fay; and so when
Sir Tristram was let into that castle he had good cheer all that
night.</p>
<p>And upon the morn, when he would have departed, the queen said, ‘Wit
ye well ye shall not depart lightly, for ye are here as a prisoner.’</p>
<p>‘Jesu defend!’ said Sir Tristram, ‘for I was but late a
prisoner.’</p>
<p>‘Fair knight,’ said the queen, ‘ye shall abide with me till that I
wit what ye are and from whence ye come.’</p>
<p>And ever the queen would set Sir Tristram on her own side, and her
paramour on the other side. And ever Queen Morgan would behold Sir
Tristram, and thereat the knight was jealous, and was in will suddenly
to have run upon Sir Tristram with a sword, but he left it for
shame.</p>
<p>Then the queen said to Sir Tristram, ‘Tell me thy name, and I shall
suffer you to depart when ye will.’</p>
<p>‘Upon that covenant I tell you my name is Sir Tristram de
Liones.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ said Morgan le Fay, ‘and I had wist that, thou shouldst not
have departed so soon as thou shalt. But sithen I have made a promise I
will hold it, with that thou wilt promise me to bear upon thee a shield
that I shall deliver thee, unto the Casde of the Hard Rock, where King
Arthur hath cried a great tournament, and there I pray you that ye will
be, and to do for me as much deeds of arms as ye may do. For at the
Castle of Maidens, Sir Tristram, ye did marvellous deeds of arms as ever
I heard knight do.’</p>
<p>‘Madam,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘let me see the shield that I shall
bear.’</p>
<p>Then the shield was brought forth, and the field was gules with a
king and queen there in painted, and a knight standing above them upon
the king’s head, and the other upon the queen’s.</p>
<p>‘Madam,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘this is a fair shield and a mighty; but
what signifieth this king and this queen, and that knight standing up
both their heads?’</p>
<p>‘I shall tell you,’ said Morgan le Fay. ‘It signifieth King Arthur
and Queen Guenever, and a knight that holdeth them both in bondage and
in servage.’</p>
<p>‘Who is that knight?’ said Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>‘That shall ye not wit as at this time,’ said the queen.</p>
<p>But as the French book saith, Queen Morgan loved Sir Launcelot best,
and ever she desired him, and he would never love her nor do nothing at
her request, and therefore she held many knights together for to have
taken him by strength. And because she deemed that Sir Launcelot loved
Queen Guenever paramour, and she him again, therefore Queen Morgan le
Fay ordained that shield to put Sir Launcelot to a rebuke, to that
intent that King Arthur might understand the love between them.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram took that shield and promised her to bear it at the
tournament at the Castle of the Hard Rock. But Sir Tristram knew not
that that shield was ordained against Sir Launcelot, but afterward he
knew it.</p>
