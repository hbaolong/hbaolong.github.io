<h4 id="chapter-33">Chapter 33</h4>
<p>How Sir Launcelot hurt Sir Tristram, and how after Sir Tristram smote
down Sir Palomides</p>
<p>Then this cry was so large that Sir Launcelot heard it. And then he
gat a great spear in his hand and came towards the cry.</p>
<p>Then Sir Launcelot cried, ‘The Knight with the Black Shield, make
thee ready to joust with me!’</p>
<p>When Sir Tristram heard him say so he gat his spear in his hand, and
either abashed down their heads, and came together as thunder; and Sir
Tristram’s spear brake in pieces, and Sir Launcelot by malfortune struck
Sir Tristram on the side a deep wound nigh to the death; but yet Sir
Tristram avoided not his saddle, and so the spear brake. Therewithal Sir
Tristram that was wounded gat out his sword, and he rashed to Sir
Launcelot, and gave him three great strokes upon the helm that the fire
sprang thereout, and Sir Launcelot abashed his head lowly toward his
saddle-bow.</p>
<p>And therewithal Sir Tristram departed from the field, for he felt him
so wounded that he weened he should have died; and Sir Dinadan espied
him and followed him into the forest.</p>
<p>Then Sir Launcelot abode and did many marvellous deeds.</p>
<p>So when Sir Tristram was departed by the forest’s side he alit, and
unlaced his harness and freshed his wound; then weened Sir Dinadan that
he should have died.</p>
<p>‘Nay, nay,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘Dinadan never dread thee, for I am
heart whole, and of this wound I shall soon be whole, by the mercy of
God.’</p>
<p>By that Sir Dinadan was ware where came Palomides riding straight
upon them. And then Sir Tristram was ware that Sir Palomides came to
have destroyed him.</p>
<p>And so Sir Dinadan gave him warning, and said, ‘Sir Tristram, my
lord, ye are so sore wounded that ye may not have ado with him,
therefore I will ride against him and do to him what I may, and if I be
slain ye may pray for my soul; and in the meanwhile ye may withdraw you
and go into the castle, or in the forest, that he shall not meet with
you.’</p>
<p>Sir Tristram smiled and said, ‘I thank you, Sir Dinadan, of your good
will, but ye shall wit that I am able to handle him.’ And then anon
hastily he armed him, and took his horse, and a great spear in his hand,
and said to Sir Dinadan, ‘Adieu!’ and rode toward Sir Palomides a soft
pace.</p>
<p>Then when Sir Palomides saw that, he made countenance to amend his
horse, but he did it for this cause, for he abode Sir Gaheris that came
after him. And when he was come he rode toward Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>Then Sir Tristram sent unto Sir Palomides, and required him to joust
with him; and if he smote down Sir Palomides he would do no more to him;
and if it so happened that Sir Palomides smote down Sir Tristram, he had
him do his utterance.</p>
<p>So they were accorded. Then they met together, and Sir Tristram smote
down Sir Palomides that he had a grievous fall, so that he lay still as
he had been dead. And then Sir Tristram ran upon Sir Gaheris, and he
would not have jousted; but whether he would or not Sir Tristram smote
him over his horse’s croup, that he lay still as though he had been
dead.</p>
<p>And then Sir Tristram rode his way and left Sir Persides’ squire
within the pavilions, and Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode to an old
knight’s place to lodge them. And that old knight had five sons at the
tournament, for whom he prayed God heartily for their coming home. And
so, as the French book saith, they came home all five well beaten.</p>
<p>And when Sir Tristram departed into the forest, Sir Launcelot held
alway the stour like hard, as a man araged that took no heed to himself,
and wit ye well there was many a noble knight against him.</p>
<p>And when King Arthur saw Sir Launcelot do so marvellous deeds of arms
he then armed him, and took his horse and his armour, and rode into the
field to help Sir Launcelot; and so many knights came in with King
Arthur. And to make short tale in conclusion the King of Northgales and
the King of the Hundred Knights were put to the worse; and because Sir
Launcelot abode and was the last in the field the prize was given
him.</p>
<p>But Sir Launcelot would neither for king, queen, ne knight, have the
prize, but where the cry was cried through the field: ‘Sir Launcelot,
Sir Launcelot hath won the field this day.’ Sir Launcelot let make
another cry contrary: ‘Sir Tristram hath won the field, for he began
first, and last he hath endured, and so hath he done the first day, the
second, and the third day.’</p>
