<h4 id="chapter-20">Chapter 20</h4>
<p>How King Mark found Sir Tristram naked, and made him to be borne home
to Tintagel, and how he was there known by a brachet</p>
<p>Then the knight took up the giant’s head and bare it with him unto
King Mark, and told him what adventure betid him in the forest, and how
a naked man rescued him from the grimly giant, Tawleas.</p>
<p>‘Where had ye this adventure?’ said King Mark.</p>
<p>‘Forsooth,’ said Sir Dinaunt, ‘at the fair fountain in your forest
where many adventurous knights meet, and there is the mad man.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said King Mark, ‘I will see that wild man.’</p>
<p>So within a day or two King Mark command d his knights and his
hunters that they should be ready on the morn for to hunt, and so upon
the morn he went unto that forest.</p>
<p>And when the king came to that well he found there lying by that well
a fair naked man, and a sword by him. Then King Mark blew and straked,
and therewith his knights came to him; and then the king commanded his
knights to: ‘Take that naked man with fairness, and bring him to my
castle.’</p>
<p>So they did safely and fair, and cast mantles upon Sir Tristram, and
so led him unto Tintagel; and there they bathed him, and washed him, and
gave him hot suppings till they had brought him well to his remembrance;
but all this while there was no creature that knew Sir Tristram, nor
what man he was.</p>
<p>So it fell upon a day that the queen, La Beale Isoud, heard of such a
man, that ran naked in the forest, and how the king had brought him home
to the court.</p>
<p>Then La Beale Isoud called unto her Dame Bragwaine and said, ‘Come on
with me, for we will go see this man that my lord brought from the
forest the last day.’</p>
<p>So they passed forth, and spered where was the sick man. And then a
squire told the queen that he was in the garden taking his rest, and
repos〔ing〕 him against the sun.</p>
<p>So when the queen looked upon Sir Tristram she was not remembered of
him. But ever she said unto Dame Bragwaine, ‘Meseemeth I should have
seen him heretofore in many places.’</p>
<p>But as soon as Sir Tristram saw her he knew her well enough. And then
he turned away his visage and wept.</p>
<p>Then the queen had always a little brachet with her that Sir Tristram
gave her the first time that ever she came into Cornwall, and never
would that brachet depart from her but if Sir Tristram was nigh thereas
was La Beale Isoud; and this brachet was sent from the king’s daughter
of France unto Sir Tristram for great love. And anon as this little
brachet felt a savour of Sir Tristram, she leapt upon him and licked his
lears and his ears, and then she whined and quested, and she smelled at
his feet and at his hands, and on all parts of his body that she might
come to.</p>
<p>‘Ah, my lady,’ said Dame Bragwaine unto La Beale Isoud, ‘alas, alas,’
said she, ‘I see it is mine own lord, Sir Tristram.’</p>
<p>And thereupon Isoud fell down in a swoon, and so lay a great while.
And when she might speak she said, ‘My lord Sir Tristram, blessed be God
ye have your life, and now I am sure ye shall be discovered by this
little brachet, for she will never leave you. And also I am sure as soon
as my lord, King Mark, do know you he will banish you out of the country
of Cornwall, or else he will destroy you. For God’s sake, mine own lord,
grant King Mark his will, and then draw you unto the court of King
Arthur, for there are ye beloved, and ever when I may I shall send unto
you; and when ye list ye may come to me, and at all times early and late
I will be at your commandment, to live as poor a life as ever did queen
or lady.’</p>
<p>‘O madam,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘go from me, for mickle anger and
danger have I escaped for your love.’</p>
<p>straked: sounded a note on the horn.</p>
<p>lears: cheeks.</p>
