<h4 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h4>
<p>Of the birth of King Arthur and of his nurture</p>
<p>Then Queen Agraine waxed daily greater and greater, so it befell
after within half a year, as King Uther lay by his queen, he asked her,
by the faith she ought to him, whose was the child within her body; then
was she sore abashed to give answer.</p>
<p>‘Dismay you not,’ said the king, ‘but tell me the truth, and I shall
love you the better, by the faith of my body.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said she, ‘I shall tell you the truth. The same night that my
lord was dead, the hour of his death, as his knights record, there came
into my castle of Tintagel a man like my lord in speech and in
countenance, and two knights with him in likeness of his two knights
Brastias and Jordans, and so I went unto bed with him as I ought to do
with my lord, and the same night, as I shall answer unto God, this child
was begotten upon me.’</p>
<p>‘That is truth,’ said the king, ‘as ye say; for it was I myself that
came in the likeness, and therefore dismay you not, for I am father to
the child;’ and there he told her all the cause, how it was by Merlin’s
counsel. Then the queen made great joy when she knew who was the father
of her child.</p>
<p>Soon came Merlin unto the king, and said, ‘Sir, ye must purvey you
for the nourishing of your child.’</p>
<p>‘As thou wilt,’ said the king, ‘be it.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Merlin, ‘I know a lord of yours in this land, that is a
passing true man and a faithful, and he shall have the nourishing of
your child; and his name is Sir Ector, and he is a lord of fair
livelihood in many parts in England and Wales; and this lord, Sir Ector,
let him be sent for, for to come and speak with you, and desire him
yourself, as he loveth you, that he will put his own child to nourishing
to another woman, and that his wife nourish yours. And when the child is
born let it be delivered to me at yonder privy postern
unchristened.’</p>
<p>So like as Merlin devised it was done. And when Sir Ector was come he
made fiance to the king for to nourish the child like as the king
desired; and there the king granted Sir Ector great rewards. Then when
the lady was delivered, the king commanded two knights and two ladies to
take the child, bound in a cloth of gold, ‘and that ye deliver him to
what poor man ye meet at the postern gate of the castle.’ So the child
was delivered unto Merlin, and so he bare it forth unto Sir Ector, and
made an holy man to christen him, and named him Arthur; and so Sir
Ector’s wife nourished him with her own pap.</p>
<p>ought to him: owed him. purvey: provide.</p>
