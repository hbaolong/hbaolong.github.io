<h4 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h4>
<p>How Beaumains fought with Sir Persant of Inde, and made him to be
yielden</p>
<p>With this Sir Persant of Inde had espied them as they hoved in the
field, and knightly he sent to them whether he came in war or in
peace.</p>
<p>‘Say to thy lord,’ said Beaumains, ‘I take no force, but whether as
him list himself.’</p>
<p>So the messenger went again unto Sir Persant and told him all his
answer.</p>
<p>‘Well then will I have ado with him to the utterance,’ and so he
purveyed him and rode against him.</p>
<p>And Beaumains saw him and made him ready, and there they met with all
that ever their horses might run, and brast their spears either in three
pieces, and their horses rashed so together that both their horses fell
dead to the earth; and lightly they avoided their horses and put their
shields afore them, and drew their swords, and gave many great strokes
that sometime they hurtled together that they fell grovelling on the
ground. Thus they fought two hours and more, that their shields and
their hauberks were all forhewn, and in many steads they were
wounded.</p>
<p>So at the last Sir Beaumains smote him through the cost of the body,
and then he retrayed him here and there, and knightly maintained his
battle long time. And at the last, though him loth were, Beaumains smote
Sir Persant above upon the helm, that he fell grovelling to the earth;
and then he leapt upon him overthwart and unlaced his helm to. have
slain him. Then Sir Persant yielded him and asked him mercy. With that
came the damosel and prayed to save his life.</p>
<p>‘I will well, for it were pity this noble knight should die.’</p>
<p>‘Gramercy,’ said Persant, ‘gentle knight and damosel. For certainly
now I wot well it was ye that slew my brother the Black Knight at the
black thorn; he was a full noble knight, his name was Sir Percard. Also
I am sure that ye are he that won mine other brother the Green Knight,
his name was Sir Pertolepe. Also ye won my brother the Red Knight, Sir
Perimones. And now since ye have won these, this shall I do for to
please you: ye shall have homage and fealty of me, and an hundred
knights to be always at your commandment, to go and ride where ye will
command us.’</p>
<p>And so they went unto Sir Persant’s pavilion and drank the wine, and
ate spices, and afterward Sir Persant made him to rest upon a bed until
supper time, and after supper to bed again. When Beaumains was abed, Sir
Persant had a lady, a fair daughter of eighteen year of age, and there
he called her unto him, and charged her and commanded her upon his
blessing to go unto the knight’s bed, ‘and lie down by his side, and
make him no strange cheer, but good cheer, and take him in thine arms
and kiss him, and look that this be done, I charge you, as ye will have
my love and my good will.’</p>
<p>So Sir Persant’s daughter did as her father bad her, and so she went
unto Sir Beaumains’ bed, and privily she dispoiled her, and laid her
down by him, and then he awoke and saw her, and asked her what she
was.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ she said, ‘I am Sir Persant’s daughter, that by the
commandment of my father am come hither.’</p>
<p>‘Be ye a maid or a wife?’ said he.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ she said, ‘I am a clean maiden.’</p>
<p>‘God defend,’ said he, ‘that I should defile you to do Sir Persant
such a shame; therefore, fair damosel, arise out of this bed or else I
will.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ she said, ‘I came not to you by mine own will, but as I was
commanded.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Sir Beaumains, ‘I were a shameful knight and I would do
your father any disworship;’ and so he kissed her, and so she departed
and came unto Sir Persant her father, and told him all how she had
sped.</p>
<p>‘Truly,’ said Sir Persant, ‘whatsomever he be, he is comen of a noble
blood.’</p>
<p>And so we leave them there till on the morn.</p>
<p>retrayed him: drew back, dispoiled her: undressed.</p>
