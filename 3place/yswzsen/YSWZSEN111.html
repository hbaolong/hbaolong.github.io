<h4 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h4>
<p>How Sir Turquin was slain, and how Sir Launcelot bad Sir Gaheris
deliver all the prisoners</p>
<p>Then at the last Sir Turquin waxed faint, and gave somewhat aback,
and bare his shield low for weariness. That espied Sir Launcelot, and
leapt upon him fiercely and gat him by the beaver of his helmet, and
plucked him down on his knees, and anon he rased off his helm, and smote
his neck in sunder.</p>
<p>And when Sir Launcelot had done this, he yode unto the damosel and
said, ‘Damosel, I am ready to go with you where ye will have me, but I
have no horse.’</p>
<p>‘Fair sir,’ said she, ‘take this wounded knight’s horse and send him
into this manor, and command him to deliver all the prisoners.’</p>
<p>So Sir Launcelot went unto Gaheris, and prayed him not to be
aggrieved for to lend him his horse.</p>
<p>‘Nay, fair lord’ said Gaheris, ‘I will that ye take my horse at your
own commandment, for ye have both saved me and my horse, and this day I
say ye are the best knight in the world, for ye have slain this day in
my sight the mightiest man and the best knight except you that ever I
saw, and, fair sir,’ said Gaheris, ‘I pray you tell me your name.’</p>
<p>‘Sir, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake, that ought to help you of
right for King Arthur’s sake, and in especial for my lord Sir Gawain’s
sake, your own dear brother. And when that ye come within yonder manor,
I am sure ye shall find there many knights of the Round Table, for I
have seen many of their shields that I know on yonder tree. There is
Kay’s shield, and Sir Brandiles’ shield, and Sir Marhaus’ shield, and
Sir Galihud’s shield, and Sir Brian de Listonoise’s shield, and Sir
Aliduke’s shield, with many more that I am not now advised of, and also
my two brethren’s shields, Sir Ector de Maris and Sir Lionel. Wherefore
I pray you greet them all from me, and say that I bid them take such
stuff there as they find, and that in any wise my brethren go unto the
court and abide me there till that I come, for by the feast of Pentecost
I cast me to be there, for as at this time I must ride with this damosel
for to save my promise.’</p>
<p>And so he departed from Gaheris, and Gaheris yede into the manor, and
there he found a yeoman porter keeping there many keys. Anon withal Sir
Gaheris threw the porter unto the ground and took the keys from him, and
hastily he opened the prison door, and there he let out all the
prisoners, and every man loosed other of their bonds. And when they saw
Sir Gaheris, all they thanked him, for they weened that he was
wounded.</p>
<p>‘Not so,’ said Gaheris, ‘it was Launcelot that slew him worshipfully
with his own hands. I saw it with mine own eyen. And he greeteth you all
well, and prayeth you to haste you to the court; and as unto Sir Lionel
and Ector de Maris he prayeth you to abide him at the court.’</p>
<p>‘That shall we not do,’ said his brethren, ‘we will find him and we
may live.’</p>
<p>‘So shall I,’ said Sir Kay, ‘find him or I come at the court as I am
true knight.’</p>
<p>Then all those knights sought the house thereas the armour was, and
then they armed them, and every knight found his own horse, and all that
ever longed unto him. And when this was done, there came a forester with
four horses lade with fat venison.</p>
<p>Anon, Sir Kay said, ‘Here is good meat for us for one meal, for we
had not many a day no good repast.’</p>
<p>And so that venison was roasted, baken, and sodden, and so after
supper some abode there all that night, but Sir Lionel and Ector de
Maris and Sir Kay rode after Sir Launcelot to find him if they
might.</p>
<p>rashing: dashing.</p>
