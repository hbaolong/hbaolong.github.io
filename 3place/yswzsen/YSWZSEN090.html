<h4 id="chapter-28">Chapter 28</h4>
<p>How at the year’s end all three knights with their three damosels met
at the fountain</p>
<p>Right so at the twelvemonths’ end they met all three knights at the
fountain and their damosels, but the damosel that Sir Gawain had could
say but little worship of him. So they departed from the damosels and
rode through a great forest, and there they met with a messenger that
came from King Arthur, that had sought them well nigh a twelvemonth
throughout all England, Wales, and Scotland, and charged if ever he
might find Sir Gawain and Sir Uwain to bring them to the court again.
And then were they all glad, and so prayed they Sir Marhaus to ride with
them to the king’s court.</p>
<p>And so within twelve days they came to Camelot, and the king was
passing glad of their coming, and so was all the court. Then the king
made them to swear upon a book to tell him all their adventures that had
befall them that twelvemonth, and so they did. And there was Sir Marhaus
well-known, for there were knights that he had matched aforetime, and he
was named one of the best knights living.</p>
<p>Against the feast of Pentecost came the Damosel of the Lake and
brought with her Sir Pelleas; and at that high feast there was great
jousting of knights, and of all knights that were at that jousts, Sir
Pelleas had the prize,and Sir Marhaus was named the next; but Sir
Pelleas was so strong there might but few knights sit him a buffet with
a spe. And at that next feast Sir Pelleas and Sir Marhaus were made
knights of the Table Round, for there were two sieges void, for two
knights were slain that twelvemonth, and great joy had King Arthur of
Sir Pelleas and of Sir Marhaus.</p>
<p>But Pelleas loved never after Sir Gawain, but as he spared him for
the love of King Arthur; but ofttimes at jousts and tournaments Sir
Pelleas quit Sir Gawain, for so it rehearseth in the book of French. So
Sir Tristram many days after fought with Sir Marhaus in an island, and
there they did a great battle, but at the last Sir Tristram slew him, so
Sir Tristram was wounded that unnethe he might recover, and lay at a
nunnery half a year. And Sir Pelleas was a worshipful knight, and was
one of the four that achieved the Sangrail;1 and the Damosel of the Lake
made by her means that never he had ado with Sir Launcelot de Lake, for
where Sir Launcelot was at any jousts or any tournament, she would not
suffer him be there that day, but if it were on the side of Sir
Launcelot.</p>
