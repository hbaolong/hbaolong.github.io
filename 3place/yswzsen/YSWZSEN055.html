<h4 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h4>
<p>How four knights fought against Sir Gawain and Gaheris, and how they
were overcome, and their lives saved at the request of four ladies</p>
<p>And Sir Gawai went into the castle, and made him ready to lie there
all night, and would have unarmed him.</p>
<p>‘What will ye do,’ said Gaheris, ‘will ye unarm you in this country?
Ye may think ye have many enemies here.’</p>
<p>They had not sooner said that word but there came four knights well
armed, and assailed Sir Gawain hard, and said unto him, ‘Thou new-made
knight, thou hast shamed thy knighthood, for a knight without mercy is
dishonoured. Also thou hast slain a fair lady to thy great shame to the
world’s end, and doubt thou not thou shalt have great need of mercy or
thou depart from us.’</p>
<p>And therewith one of them smote Sir Gawain a great stroke that nigh
he fell to the earth, and Gaheris smote him again sore, and so they were
on the one side and on the other, that Sir Gawain and Gaheris were in
jeopardy of their lives; and one with a bow, an archer, smote Sir Gawain
through the arm that it grieved him wonderly sore.</p>
<p>And as they should have been slain, there came four fair ladies, and
besought the knights of grace for Sir Gawain; and goodly at request of
the ladies they gave Sir Gawain and Gaheris their lives, and made them
to yield them as prisoners. Then Gawain and Gaheris made great dole.</p>
<p>‘Alas!’ said Sir Gawain, ‘mine arm grieveth me sore, I am like to be
maimed;’ and so made his complaint piteously.</p>
<p>Early on the morrow there came to Sir Gawain one of the four ladies
that had heard all his complaint, and said, ‘Sir knight, what
cheer?’</p>
<p>‘Not good,’ said he.</p>
<p>‘It is your own default,’ said the lady, ‘for ye have done a passing
foul deed in the slaying of the lady, the which will be great villainy
unto you. But be ye not of King Arthur’s kin?’ said the lady.</p>
<p>‘Yes truly,’ said Sir Gawain.</p>
<p>‘What is your name?’ said the lady, ‘Ye must tell it me or ye
pass.’</p>
<p>‘My name is Gawain, the King Lot of Orkney’s son, and my mother is
King Arthur’s sister.’</p>
<p>‘Ah! then are ye nephew unto King Arthur,’ said the lady, ‘and I
shall so speak for you that ye shall have conduct to go to King Arthur
for his love.’</p>
<p>And so she departed and told the four knights how their prisoner was
King Arthur’s nephew, ‘and his name is Sir Gawain, King Lot’s son of
Orkney.’ And they gave him the hart’s head because it was in his quest.
Then anon they delivered Sir Gawain under this promise, that he should
bear the dead lady with him in this manner: the head of her was hanged
about his neck, and the whole body of her lay before him on his horse’s
mane.</p>
<p>Right so rode he forth unto Camelot. And anon as he was come, Merlin
desired of King Arthur that Sir Gawain should be sworn to tell of all
his adventures, and how he slew the lady, and how he would give no mercy
unto the knight, wherethrough the lady was slain. Then the king and the
queen were greatly displeased with Sir Gawain for the slaying of the
lady.</p>
<p>And there by ordinance of the queen there was set a quest of ladies
on Sir Gawain, and they judged him for ever while he lived to be with
all ladies, and to fight for their quarrels; and that ever he should be
courteous, and never to refuse mercy to him that asketh mercy. Thus was
Gawain sworn upon the four Evangelists that he should never be against
lady ne gentlewoman, but if he fought for a lady and his adversary
fought for another. And thus endeth the adventure of Sir Gawain that he
did at the marriage of King Arthur. Amen.</p>
<p>I take no force of: I do not care about.</p>
