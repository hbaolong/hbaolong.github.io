<h4 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h4>
<p>How Uther Pendragon made war on the Duke of Cornwall, and how by the
mean of Merlin he lay by the Duchess and gat Arthur</p>
<p>Then Ulfius was glad, and rode on more than a pace till that he came
to King Uther Pendragon, and told him he had met with Merlin.</p>
<p>‘Where is he?’ said the king.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Ulfius, ‘he will not dwell long.’</p>
<p>Therewithal Ulfius was ware where Merlin stood at the porch of the
pavilion’s door. And then Merlin was bound to come to the king. When
King Uther saw him, he said he was welcome.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Merlin ‘I know all your heart every deal. So ye will be
sworn unto me as ye be a true king anointed, to fulfil my desire, ye
shall have your desire.’</p>
<p>Then the king was sworn upon the four Evangelists.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Merlin, ‘this is my desire: the first night that ye shall
lie by Igraine ye shall get a child on her, and when that is born, that
it shall be delivered to me for to nourish there as I will have it; for
it shall be your worship, and the child’s avail as mickle as the child
is worth.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said the king, ‘as thou wilt have it.’</p>
<p>‘Now make you ready,’ said Merlin, ‘this night ye shall lie with
Igraine in the Castle of Tintagel, and ye shall be like the duke her
husband, Ulfius shall be like Sir Brastias, a knight of the duke’s, and
I will be like a knight that hight Sir Jordans, a knight of the duke’s.
But wait ye make not many questions with her nor her men, but say ye are
diseased, and so hie you to bed, and rise not on the morn till I come to
you, for the Castle of Tintagel is but ten miles hence.’</p>
<p>So this was done as they devised. But the Duke of Tintagel espied how
the king rode from the siege of Terrabil, and therefore that night he
issued out of the castle at a postern for to have distressed the king’s
host. And so, through his own issue, the duke himself was slain or-ever
the king came at the Castle of Tintagel.</p>
<p>So after the death of the duke, King Uther lay with Igraine more than
three hours after his death, and begat on her that night Arthur; and, or
day came, Merlin came to the king, and bad him make him ready, and so he
kissed the lady Igraine and departed in all haste. But when the lady
heard tell of the duke her husband, and by all record he was dead
or-ever King Uther came to her, then she marvelled who that might be
that lay with her in likeness of her lord; so she mourned privily and
held her peace.</p>
<p>Then all the barons by one assent prayed the king of accord betwixt
the lady Igraine and him; the king gave them leave, for fain would he
have been accorded with her. So the king put all the trust in Ulfius to
entreat between them, so by the entreaty at the last the king and she
met together.</p>
<p>‘Now will we do well,’ said Ulfius. ‘Our king is a lusty knight and
wifeless, and my lady Igraine is a passing fair lady; it were great joy
unto us all, and it might please the king to make her his queen.’</p>
<p>Unto that they all well accorded and moved it to the king. And anon,
like a lusty knight, he assented thereto with good will, and so in all
haste they were married in a morning with great mirth and joy.</p>
<p>And King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney then wedded Margawse that was
Gawain’s mother, and King Nentres of the land of Garlot wedded Elaine.
All this was done at the request of King Uther. And the third sister
Morgan le Fay was put to school in a nunnery, and there she learned so
much that she was a great clerk of necromancy, and after she was wedded
to King Uriens of the land of Gore, that was Sir Uwain’s le Blanchemains
father.</p>
<p>or-ever: before. fain: gladly. entreat: negotiate.</p>
<p>and it might please: if it might please.</p>
