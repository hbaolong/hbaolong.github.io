<h4 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h4>
<p>How Balin met with his brother Balan, and how each of them slew other
unknown, till they were wounded to death</p>
<p>Then afore him he saw come riding out of a castle a knight, and his
horse trapped all red, and himself in the same colour. When this knight
in the red beheld Balin, him thought it should be his brother Balin
because of his two swords, but because he knew not his shield he deemed
it was not he. And so they aventred their spears and came marvellously
fast together, and they smote other in the shields, but their spears and
their course were so big that it bare down horse and man that they lay
both in a swoon.</p>
<p>But Balin was bruised sore with the fall of his horse, for he was
weary of travel. And Balan was the first that rose on foot and drew his
sword, and went toward Balin, and he arose and went against him; but
Balan smote Balin first, and he put up his shield and smote him through
the shield and tamed his helm. Then Balin smote him again with that
unhappy sword, and well nigh had felled his brother Balan, and so they
fought there together till their breaths failed.</p>
<p>Then Balin looked up to the castle and saw the towers stand full of
ladies. So they went unto battle again, and wounded every each other
dolefully, and then they breathed ofttimes, and so went unto battle that
all the place there as they fought was blood red. And at that time there
was none of them both but they had either smitten other seven great
wounds, so that the least of them might have been the death of the
mightiest giant in this world.</p>
<p>Then they went to battle again so marvellously that doubt it was to
hear of that battle for the great blood-shedding, and their hauberks
unnailed, that naked they were on every side.</p>
<p>At last Balan the younger brother withdrew him a little and laid him
down. Then said Balin le Savage, ‘What knight art thou? For or now I
found never no knight that matched me.’</p>
<p>‘My name is,’ said he, ‘Balan, brother unto the good knight,
Balin.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Balin, ‘that ever I should see this day,’ and therewith
he fell backward in a swoon.</p>
<p>Then Balan yede on all four feet and hands, and put off the helm of
his brother, and might not know him by the visage it was so full hewn
and bled; but when he awoke he said, ‘O Balan, my brother, thou hast
slain me and I thee, wherefore all the wide world shall speak of us
both.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Balan, ‘that ever I saw this day, that through mishap I
might not know you, for I espied well your two swords, but because ye
had another shield I deemed ye had been another knight.’</p>
<p>‘Alas,’ said Balin, ‘all that made an unhappy knight in the castle,
for he caused me to leave mine own shield to our both’s destruction, and
if I might live I would destroy that castle for ill customs.’</p>
<p>‘That were well done,’ said Balan, ‘for I had never grace to depart
from them since that I came hither, for here it happed me to slay a
knight that kept this island, and since might I never depart, and no
more should ye, brother, and ye might have slain me as ye have, and
escaped yourself with the life.’</p>
<p>Right so came the lady of the tower with four knights and six ladies
and six yeomen unto them, and there she heard how they made their moan
either to other, and said, ‘We came both out of one tomb, that is to say
one mother’s belly, and so shall we lie both in one pit.’ So Balan
prayed the lady of her gentleness, for his true service, that she would
bury them both in that same place there the battle was done. And she
granted them with weeping it should be done richly in the best
manner.</p>
<p>‘Now, will ye send for a priest, that we may receive our sacrament,
and receive the blessed body of Our Lord Jesus Christ?’</p>
<p>‘Yea,’ said the lady, ‘it shall be done;’ and so she sent for a
priest and gave them their rites.</p>
<p>‘Now,’ said Balin, ‘when we are buried in one tomb, and the mention
made over us how two brethren slew each other, there will never good
knight nor good man see our tomb but they will pray for our souls.’</p>
<p>And so all the ladies and gentlewomen wept for pity. Then anon Balan
died, but Balin died not till the midnight after, and so were they
buried both, and the lady let make a mention of Balan how he was there
slain by his brother’s hands, but she knew not Balin’s name.</p>
<p>blessed him: crossed himself.</p>
<p>aventred: set in position. tamed: pierced. doubt: a fearful thing.
yede: went.</p>
<p>all that made an unhappy knight in the castle: ‘a wretched knight in
the castle caused all that.’</p>
