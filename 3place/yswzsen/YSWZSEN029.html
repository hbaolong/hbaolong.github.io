<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>
<p>Of a damosel which came girt with a sword for to find a man of such
virtue to draw it out of the scabbard</p>
<p>After the death of Uther Pendragon reigned Arthur his son, the which
had great war in his days for to get all England into his hand. For
there were many kings within the realm of England, and in Wales,
Scotland, and Cornwall.</p>
<p>So it befell on a time when King Arthur was at London, there came a
knight and told the king tidings how that the King Rience of North Wales
had reared a great number of people, and were entered into the land, and
burnt and slew the king’s true liege people.</p>
<p>‘If this be true,’ said Arthur, ‘it were great shame unto mine estate
but that he were mightily withstood.’</p>
<p>‘It is truth,’ said the knight, ‘for I saw the host myself.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said the king, ‘let make a cry, that all the lords, knights,
and gentlemen of arms should draw unto a castle’ (called Camelot in
those days) ‘and there the king would let make a council-general and a
great jousts,’</p>
<p>So when the king was come thither with all his baronage, and lodged
as they seemed best, there was come a damosel the which was sent on
message from the great lady Lile of Avelion. And when she came before
King Arthur, she told from whom she came, and how she was sent on
message unto him for these causes. Then she let her mantle fall that was
richly furred; and then was she girt with a noble sword whereof the king
had marvel, and said, ‘Damosel, for what cause are ye girt with that
sword? It beseemeth you not.’</p>
<p>‘Now shall I tell you,’ said the damosel. ‘This sword that I am girt
withal doth me great sorrow and cumberance, for I may not be delivered
of this sword but by a knight, but he must be a passing good man of his
hands and of his deeds, and without villainy or treachery, and without
treason. And if I may find such a knight that hath all these virtues, he
may draw out this sword out of the sheath, for I have been at King
Rience’s, it was told me there were passing good knights, and he and all
his knights have assayed it and none can speed.’</p>
<p>‘This is a great marvel,’ said Arthur, ‘if this be sooth; I will
myself assay to draw out the sword, not presuming upon myself that I am
the best knight, but that I will begin to draw at your sword in giving
example to all the barons that they shall assay every each one after
other when I have assayed it.’</p>
<p>Then Arthur took the sword by the sheath and by the girdle and pulled
at it eagerly, but the sword would not out.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the damosel, ‘you need not to pull half so hard, for he
that shall pull it out shall do it with little might.’</p>
<p>‘Ye say well,’ said Arthur; ‘now assay ye all my barons’</p>
<p>‘But beware ye be not defiled with shame, treachery ne guile; then it
will not avail,’ said the damosel, ‘for he must be a clean knight
without villainy, and of a gentle strain of father side and mother
side.’</p>
<p>Most of all the barons of the Round Table that were there at that
time assayed all by row,, but there might none speed; wherefore the
damosel made great sorrow out of measure, and said, ‘Alas; I weened in
this court had been the best knights without treachery or treason.’</p>
<p>‘By my faith,’ saith Arthur, ‘here are good knights, as I deem, as
any be in the world, but their grace is not to help you, wherefore I am
displeased.’</p>
<p>beseemeth: befits.</p>
<p>sooth: true.</p>
