<h4 id="chapter-39">Chapter 39</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Nabon, and overcame him, and made
Sir Segwarides lord of the isle</p>
<p>In the meantime there came word that Sir Nabon had made a cry that
all the people of that isle should be at his castle the fifth day after.
And the same day the son of Nabon should be made knight, and all the
knights of that valley and thereabout should be there to joust, and all
those of the realm of Logris should be there to joust with them of North
Wales: and thither came five hundred knights, and they of the country
brought thither Sir Lamorak, and Sir Tristram, and Sir Kehydius, and Sir
Segwarides, for they durst none otherwise do.</p>
<p>And then Sir Nabon lent Sir Lamorak horse and armour at Sir Lamorak’s
desire, and Sir Lamorak jousted and did such deeds of arms that Nabon
and all the people said there was never knight that ever they saw do
such deeds of arms; for, as the French book saith, he forjousted all
that were there for the most part of five hundred knights, that none
abode him in his saddle.</p>
<p>Then Sir Nabon proffered to play with him his play: ‘For I saw never
no knight do so much upon a day.’</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘play as I may, but I am weary and
sore bruised.’</p>
<p>And there either gat a spear, but Nabon would not encounter with Sir
Lamorak, but smote his horse in the forehead, and so slew him; and then
Sir Lamorak yede on foot, and turned his shield and drew his sword, but
there began strong battle on foot. But Sir Lamorak was so sore bruised
and short breathed, that he traced and traversed somewhat aback.</p>
<p>‘Fair fellow,’ said Sir Nabon, ‘hold thy hand and I shall show thee
more courtesy than ever I showed knight, because I have seen this day
thy noble knighthood, and therefore stand thou by, and I will wit
whether any of thy fellows will have ado with me.’</p>
<p>Then when Sir Tristram heard that, he stepped forth and said, ‘Nabon,
lend me horse and sure armour, and I will have ado with thee.’</p>
<p>‘Well, fellow,’ said Sir Nabon, ‘go thou to yonder pavilion, and arm
thee of the best thou findest there, and I shall play a marvellous play
with thee.’</p>
<p>Then said Sir Tristram, ‘Look ye play well, or else peradventure, I
shall learn you a new play.’</p>
<p>‘That is well said, fellow,’ said Sir Nabon.</p>
<p>So when Sir Tristram was armed as him liked best, and well shielded
and sworded, he dressed to him on foot; for well he knew Sir Nabon would
not abide a stroke with a spear, therefore he would slay all knights’
horses.</p>
<p>‘Now, fair fellow,’ said Sir Nabon, ‘let us play.’</p>
<p>So then they fought long on foot, tracing and traversing, smiting and
foining long without any rest.</p>
<p>At the last Sir Nabon prayed him to tell him his name.</p>
<p>‘Sir Nabon, I tell thee my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, a knight
of Cornwall under King Mark.’</p>
<p>‘Thou art welcome,’ said Sir Nabon, ‘for of all knights I have most
desired to fight with thee or with Sir Launcelot.’</p>
<p>So then they went eagerly together, and Sir Tristam slew Sir Nabon,
and so forthwith he leapt to his son, and struck off his head. And then
all the country said they would hold of Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I will not so; here is a worshipful
knight, Sir Lamorak de Gales, that for me he shall be lord of this
country, for he hath done here great deeds of arms.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Lamorak, ‘I will not be lord of this country, for I
have not deserved it as well as ye, therefore give ye it where ye will,
for I will none have.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘since ye nor I will not have it, let us
give it to him that hath not so well deserved it.’</p>
<p>‘Do as ye list,’ said Segwarides, ‘for the gift is yours, for I will
none have and I had deserved it.’</p>
<p>So was it given to Segwarides, whereof he thanked them; and so was he
lord, and worshipfully he did govern it. And then Sir Segwarides
delivered all prisoners, and set good governance in that valley; and so
he turned into Cornwall, and told King Mark and La Beale Isoud how Sir
Tristram had advanced him to the Isle of Servage, and there he
proclaimed in all Cornwall of all the adventures of these two knights,
so was it openly known.</p>
<p>But full woe was La Beale Isoud when she heard tell that Sir Tristram
was wedded to Isoud la Blanche Mains.</p>
