<h4 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h4>
<p>How a man of the country told to him of a marvellous giant, and how
he fought and conquered him</p>
<p>Then came to him an husbandman of the country, and told him how there
was in the country of Constantine, beside Brittany, a great giant which
had slain, murdered and devoured much people of the country, and had
been sustained seven year with the children of the commons of that land,
‘insomuch that all the children be all slain and destroyed; and now late
he hath taken the Duchess of Brittany as she rode with her meyne, and
hath led her to his lodging which is in a mountain, for to ravish and
lie by her to her life’s end, and many people followed her, more than
five hundred, but all they might not rescue her, but they left her
shrieking and crying lamentably, wherefore I suppose that he hath slain
her in fulfilling his foul lust of lechery. She was wife unto thy cousin
Sir Howell, whom we call full nigh of thy blood. Now, as thou 〔art〕 a
rightful king, have pity on this lady, and revenge us all as thou art a
noble conqueror.’</p>
<p>‘Alas’ said King Arthur, ‘this is a great mischief, I had lever than
the best realm that I have that I had been a furlong way tofore him for
to have rescued that lady. Now, fellow,’ said King Arthur, ‘canst thou
bring me thereas this giant haunteth?’</p>
<p>‘Yea, sir,’ said the good man, ‘look yonder whereas thou seest those
two great fires, there shalt thou find him, and more treasure than I
suppose is in all France.’</p>
<p>When the king had understanden this piteous case, he returned into
his tent. Then he called to him Sir Kay and Sir Bedevere, and commanded
them secretly to make ready horse and harness for himself and them
twain, for after evensong he would ride on pilgrimage with them two only
unto Saint Michael’s mount. And then anon he made him ready, and armed
him at all points, and took his horse and his shield.</p>
<p>And so they three departed thence and rode forth as fast as ever they
might till that they came to the fore-land of that mount. And there they
alighted, and the king commanded them to tarry there, for he would
himself go up into that mount. And so he ascended up into that hill till
he came to a great fire, and there he found a careful widow wringing her
hands and making great sorrow, sitting by a grave new made. And then
King Arthur saluted her, and demanded of her wherefore she made such
lamentation, to whom she answered and said,</p>
<p>‘Sir knight, speak soft, for yonder is a devil, if he hear thee speak
he will come and destroy thee; I hold thee unhappy; what dost thou here
in this mountain? For if ye were such fifty as ye be, ye were not able
to make resistance against this devil: here lieth a duchess dead, the
which was the fairest of all the world, wife to Sir Howell, Duke of
Brittany; he hath murdered her in forcing her, and hath slit her unto
the navel.’</p>
<p>‘Dame’ said the king, ‘I come from the noble conqueror King Arthur,
for to treat with that tyrant for his liege people.’</p>
<p>‘Fie on such treaties’ said she, ‘he setteth not by the king ne by no
man else; but and if thou have brought Arthur’s wife, dame Guenever, he
shall be gladder than thou hadst given to him half France. Beware,
approach him not too nigh, for he hath: vanquished fifteen kings, and
hath made him a coat full of precious stones enbroidered with their
beards, which they sent him to have his love for salvation of their
people at this last Christmas. And if thou wilt, speak with him at
yonder great fire at supper’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Arthur, ‘I will accomplish my message for all your
fearful words;’ and went forth by the crest of that hill, and saw where
he sat at supper gnawing on a limb of a man, baking his broad limbs by
the fire, and breechless, and three fair damosels turning three broaches
whereon were broached twelve young children late born, like young birds.
When King Arthur beheld that piteous sight he had great compassion on
them, so that his heart bled for sorrow, and hailed him saying in this
wise:</p>
<p>‘He that all the world wieldeth give thee short life and shameful
death; and the devil have thy soul. Why hast thou murdered these young
innocent children, and murdered this duchess? Therefore arise and dress
thee, thou glutton, for this day shall thou die of my hand.’</p>
<p>Then the glutton anon start up, and took a great club in his hand,
and smote at the king that his coronal fell to the earth. And the king
hit him again that he carve his belly and cut off his genitors, that his
guts and his entrails fell down to the ground. Then the giant threw away
his club, and caught the king in his arms that he crushed his ribs. Then
the three maidens kneeled down and called to Christ for help and comfort
of Arthur. And then Arthur weltered and wrung, that he was other while
under and another time above. And so weltering and wallowing they rolled
down the hill till they came to the sea mark, and ever as they so
weltered Arthur smote him with his dagger. And it fortuned they came to
the place whereas the two knights were and kept Arthur’s horse; then
when they saw the king fast in the giant’s arms they came and loosed
him.</p>
<p>And then the king commanded Sir Kay to smite off the giant’s head,
and to set it upon a truncheon of a spear, and bear it to Sir Howell,
and tell him that his enemy was slain; ‘and after let this head be
bounden to a barbican that all the people may see and behold it; and go
ye two up to the mountain, and fetch me my shield, my sword, and the
club of iron; and as for the treasure, take ye it, for ye shall find
there good out of number; so I have the kirtle and the club I desire no
more. This was the fiercest giant that ever I met with, save one in the
mount of Araby, which I overcame, but this was greater and fiercer.’</p>
<p>Then the knights fetched the club and the kirtle, and some of the
treasure they took to themself, and returned again to the host. And anon
this was known through all the country, wherefore the people came and
thanked the king.</p>
<p>And he said again, ‘Give the thank to God, and depart the goods among
you’. And after that King Arthur said and commanded his cousin Howell,
that he should ordain for a church to be builded on the same hill in the
worship of Saint Michael.</p>
<p>And on the morn the king removed with his great battle, and came into
Champagne and in a valley, and there they pitched their tents; and the
king being set at his dinner, there came in two messengers, of whom that
one was Marshal of France, and said to the king that the emperor was
entered into France, and had destroyed a great part, and was in
Burgundy, and had destroyed and made great slaughter of people, and
burnt towns and boroughs; ‘wherefore, if thou come not hastily, they
must yield up their bodies and goods.’</p>
