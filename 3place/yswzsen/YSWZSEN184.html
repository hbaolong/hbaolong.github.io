<h4 id="chapter-29">Chapter 29</h4>
<p>Of the wedding of King Mark to La Beale Isoud, and of Bragwaine her
maid, and of Palomides</p>
<p>And anon they were richly wedded with great nobley. But ever, as the
French book saith, Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud loved ever together.
Then was there great jousts and great tourneying, and many lords and
ladies were at that feast, and Sir Tristram was most praised of all
other.</p>
<p>Thus dured the feast long, and after the feast was done, within a
little while after, by the assent of two ladies that were with Queen
Isoud, they ordained for hate and envy for to destroy Dame Bragwaine,
that was maiden and lady unto La Beale Isoud; and she was sent into the
forest for to fetch herbs, and there she was met, and bound feet and
hand to a tree, and so she was bounden three days. And by fortune, Sir
Palomides found Dame Bragwaine, and there he delivered her from the
death, and brought her to a nunnery there beside, for to be
recovered.</p>
<p>When Isoud the queen missed her maiden, wit ye well she was right
heavy as ever was any queen, for of all earthly women she loved her
best: the cause was for she came with her out of her country. And so
upon a day Queen Isoud walked into the forest to put away her thoughts,
and there she went herself unto a well and made great moan.</p>
<p>And suddenly there came Palomides to her, and had heard all her
complaint, and said, ‘Madam Isoud, and ye will grant me my boon, I shall
bring to you Dame Bragwaine safe and sound.’</p>
<p>And the queen was so glad of his proffer that suddenly unadvised she
granted all his asking.</p>
<p>‘Well, madam,’ said Palomides, ‘I trust to your promise, and if ye
will abide here half an hour I shall bring her to you.’</p>
<p>‘I shall abide you,’ said La Beale Isoud.</p>
<p>And Sir Palomides rode forth his way to that nunnery, and lightly he
came again with Dame Bragwaine; but by her good will she would not have
comen again, because for love of the queen she stood in adventure of her
life. Notwithstanding, half against her will, she went with Sir
Palomides unto the queen. And when the queen saw her she was passing
glad.</p>
<p>‘Now, madam,’ said Palomides, ‘remember upon your promise, for I have
fulfilled my promise.’</p>
<p>‘Sir Palomides,’ said the queen, ‘I wot not what is your desire, but
I will that ye wit, howbeit I promised you largely, I thought none evil,
nor I warn you none ill will I do.’</p>
<p>‘Madam,’ said Sir Palomides, ‘as at this time, ye shall not know my
desire, but before my lord your husband there shall ye know that I will
have my desire that ye have promised me.’</p>
<p>And therewith the queen departed, and rode home to the king, and Sir
Palomides rode after her.</p>
<p>And when Sir Palomides came before the king, he said, ‘Sir King, I
require you as ye be a righteous king, that ye will judge me the
right.’</p>
<p>‘Tell me your cause,’ said the king, ‘and ye shall have right.’</p>
<p>nobley: pomp.</p>
<p>unadvised: rashly.</p>
