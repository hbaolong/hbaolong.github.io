<h4 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h4>
<p>How king Arthur’s sword that he fought with brake, and how he
recovered of Accolon his own sword Excalibur, and overcame his enemy</p>
<p>Then Sir Accolon began with words of treason, and said, ‘Knight, thou
art overcome, and mayst not endure, and also thou art weaponless, and
thou has lost much of thy blood, and I am full loth to slay thee,
therefore yield thee to me as recreant.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Arthur, ‘I may not so, for I have promised to do the
battle to the uttermost, by the faith of my body, while me lasteth the
life, and therefore I had lever to die with honour than to live with
shame; and if it were possible for me to die an hundred times, I had
lever to the so oft than yield me to thee; for though I lack weapon, I
shall lack no worship, and if thou slay me weaponless that shall be thy
shame.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Accolon, ‘as for the shame I will not spare, now keep
thee from me, for thou art but a dead man.’</p>
<p>And therewith Accolon gave him such a stroke that he fell nigh to the
earth, and would have had Arthur to have cried him mercy. But Sir Arthur
pressed unto Accolon with his shield, and gave him with the pommel in
his hand such a buffet that he went three strides aback.</p>
<p>When the damosel of the lake beheld Arthur, how full of prowess his
body was, and the false treason that was wrought for him to have had him
slain, she had great pity that so good a knight and such a man of
prowess should so be destroyed. And at the next stroke Sir Accolon
struck him such a stroke that by the damosel’s enchantment the sword
Excalibur fell out of Accolon’s hand to the earth.</p>
<p>And therewithal Sir Arthur lightly leapt to it, and gat it in his
hand, and forthwithal he knew that it was his sword Excalibur, and said,
‘Thou hast been from me all too long, and much damage hast thou done
me;’ and therewith he espied the scabbard hanging by his side, and
suddenly he start to him and pulled the scabbard from him, and threw it
from him as far as he might throw it. ‘O knight,’ said Arthur, ‘this day
hast thou done me great damage with this sword; now are ye come unto
your death, for I shall not warrant you but ye shall as well be rewarded
with this sword or ever we depart as thou hast rewarded me, for much
pain have ye made me to endue, and much blood have I lost.’</p>
<p>And therewith Sir Arthur rushed on him with all his might and pulled
him to the earth, and then rushed off his helm, and gave him such a
buffet on the head that the blood came out at his ears, his nose, and
his mouth.</p>
<p>‘Now will I slay thee,’ said Arthur.</p>
<p>‘Slay me ye may well,’ said Accolon, ‘and it please you, for ye are
the best knight that ever I found, and I see well that God is with you.
But for I promised to do this battle,’ said Accolon, ‘to the uttermost,
and never to be recreant while I lived, therefore shall I never yield me
with my mouth, but God do with my body what He will.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Arthur remembered him, and thought he should have seen this
knight.</p>
<p>‘Now tell me,’ said Arthur, ‘or I will slay thee, of what country art
thou, and of what court?’</p>
<p>‘Sir knight,’ said Sir Accolon, ‘I am of the court of King Arthur,
and my name is Accolon of Gaul.’</p>
<p>Then was Arthur more dismayed than he was beforehand; for then he
remembered him of his sister Morgan le Fay, and of the enchantment of
the ship. ‘O sir knight,’ said he, ‘I pray you tell me who gave you this
sword, and by whom ye had it.’</p>
<p>bated no cheer: did not look dismayed.</p>
<p>rushed off: dragged off.</p>
