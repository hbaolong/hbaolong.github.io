<h4 id="chapter-22">Chapter 22</h4>
<p>How a damosel sought help to help Sir Launcelot against thirty
knights, and how Sir Tristram fought with them</p>
<p>And at the next landing, fast by the sea, there met with Sir Tristram
and with Sir Dinadan, Sir Ector de Maris and Sir Bors de Ganis; and
there Sir Ector jousted with Sir Dinadan, and he smote him and his horse
down. And then Sir Tristram would have jousted with Sir Bors, and Sir
Bors said that he would not joust with no Cornish knights, for they are
not called men of worship; and all this was done upon a bridge.</p>
<p>And with this came Sir Bleoberis and Sir Driant, and Sir Bleoberis
proffered to joust with Sir Tristram, and there Sir Tristram smote down
Sir Bleoberis.</p>
<p>Then said Sir Bors de Ganis, ‘I wist never Cornish knight of so great
valour nor so valiant as that knight that beareth the trappers
embroidered with crowns.’</p>
<p>And then Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan departed from them into a
forest, and there met them a damosel that came for the love of Sir
Launcelot to seek after some noble knights of King Arthur’s court for to
rescue Sir Launcelot. And so Sir Launcelot was ordained, for by the
treason of Queen Morgan le Fay to have slain Sir Launcelot, and for that
cause, she ordained thirty knights to lie in await for Sir Launcelot,
and this damosel knew this treason. And for this cause the damosel came
for to seek noble knights to help Sir Launcelot. For that night, or the
day after, Sir Launcelot should come where these thirty knights
were.</p>
<p>And so this damosel met with Sir Bors and Sir Ector and with Sir
Driant, and there she told them all four of the treason of Morgan le
Fay; and then they promised her that they would be nigh where Sir
Launcelot should meet with the thirty knights. ‘And if so be they set
upon him we will do rescues as we can.’</p>
<p>So the damosel departed, and by adventure the damosel met with Sir
Tristram and with Sir Dinadan, and there the damosel told them all the
treason that was ordained for Sir Launcelot.</p>
<p>‘Fair damosel,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘bring me to that same place where
they should meet with Sir Launcelot.’</p>
<p>Then said Sir Dinadan, ‘What will ye do? It is not for us to fight
with thirty knights, and wit you well I will not thereof. As to match
one knight two or three is enough and they be men, but for to match
fifteen knights that will I never undertake.’</p>
<p>‘Fie for shame,’ said Sir Tristram. ‘Do but your part.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Dinadan, ‘I will not thereof but if ye will lend me
your shield, for ye bear a shield of Cornwall; and for the cowardice
that is named to the knights of Cornwall, by your shields ye be ever
forborne.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I will not depart from my shield for her
sake that gave it me. But one thing,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘I promise
thee, Sir Dinadan, but if thou wilt promise me to abide with me, here I
shall slay thee, for I desire no more of thee but answer one, knight.
And if thy heart will not serve thee, stand by and look upon me and
them.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Sir Dinadan, ‘I promise you to look upon and to do what I
may to save myself, but I would I had not met with you.’</p>
<p>So then anon these thirty knights came fast by these four knights,
and they were ware of them, and either of other. And so these thirty
knights let them pass,1 for this cause, that they would not wrath them,
if case be that they had ado with Sir Launcelot; and the four knights
let them pass to this intent, that they would see and behold what they
would do with Sir Launcelot.</p>
<p>And so the thirty knights passed on and came by Sir Tristram and by
Sir Dinadan, and then Sir Tristram cried on high, ‘Lo, here is a knight
against you for the love of Sir Launcelot.’ And there he slew two with
one spear and ten with his sword.</p>
<p>And then came in Sir Dinadan and he did passing well, and so of the
thirty knights there went but ten away, and they fled.</p>
<p>All this battle saw Sir Bors de Ganis and his three fellows, and then
they saw well it was the same knight that jousted with them at the
bridge; then they took their horses and rode unto Sir Tristram, and
praised him and thanked him of his good deeds, and they all desired Sir
Tristram to go with them to their lodging; and he said nay, he would not
go to no lodging. Then they all four knights prayed him to tell them his
name.</p>
<p>‘Fair lords,’ said Sir Tristram, ‘as at this time I will not tell you
my name.’</p>
<p>wrath: anger.</p>
