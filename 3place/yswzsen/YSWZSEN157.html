<h4 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h4>
<p>How the stepmother of Sir Tristram had ordained poison for to have
poisoned Sir Tristram</p>
<p>Then certain of them would have slain the child, because they would
have been lords of the country of Liones. But then through the fair
speech of the gentlewoman, and by the means that she made, the most part
of the barons would not assent thereto. And then they let carry home the
dead queen, and much dole was made for her.</p>
<p>Then this meanwhile Merlin delivered King Meliodas out of prison on
the morn after his queen was dead. And so when the king was come home
the most part of the barons made great joy. But the sorrow that the king
made for his queen that might no tongue tell. So then the king let inter
her richly, and after he let christen his child as his wife had
commanded afore her death. And then he let call him Tristram, the
sorrowful born child.</p>
<p>Then the King Meliodas endured seven years without a wife, and all
this time Tristram was nourished well. Then it befell that King Meliodas
wedded King Howel’s daughter of Brittany, and anon she had children of
King Meliodas; then was she heavy and wroth that her children should not
rejoice the country of Liones, wherefore this queen ordained for to
poison young Tristram.</p>
<p>So she let poison be put in a piece of silver in the chamber whereas
Tristram and her children were together, unto that intent that when
Tristram were thirsty he should drink that drink. And so it fell upon a
day, the queen’s son, as he was in that chamber, espied the piece with
poison, and he weened it had been good drink, and because the child was
thirsty he took the piece with poison and drank freely; and therewithal
suddenly the child brast and was dead.</p>
<p>When the queen 〔of〕 Meliodas wist of the death of her son, wit ye
well that she was heavy. But yet the king understood nothing of her
treason. Notwithstanding the queen would not leave this, but eft she let
ordain more poison, and put it in a piece.</p>
<p>And by fortune King Meliodas, her husband, found the piece with wine
where was the poison, and he that was much thirsty took the piece for to
drink thereout. And as he would have drunken thereof the queen espied
him, and then she ran unto him, and pulled the piece from him suddenly.
The king marvelled why she did so, and remembered him how her son was
suddenly slain with poison. And then he took her by the hand, and
said,</p>
<p>‘Thou false traitress, thou shalt tell me what manner of drink this
is, or else I shall slay thee.’ And therewith he pulled out his sword,
and sware a great oath that he should slay her but if she told him
truth.</p>
<p>‘Ah! mercy, my lord,’ said she, ‘and I shall tell you all.’ And then
she told him why she would have slain Tristram, because her children
should rejoice his land.</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said King Meliodas, ‘and therefore shall ye have the
law.’</p>
<p>And so she was damned by the assent of the barons to be burnt; and
then was there made a great fire, and right as she was at the fire to
take her execution, young Tristram kneeled afore King Meliodas, and
besought him to give him a boon.</p>
<p>‘I will well,’ said the king again.</p>
<p>Then said young Tristram, ‘Give me the life of thy queen, my
stepmother.’</p>
<p>‘That is unrightfully asked,’ said King Meliodas, ‘for thou ought of
right to hate her, for she would have slain thee with that poison and
she might have had her will; and for thy sake most is my cause that she
should die.’</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said Tristram, ‘as for that, I beseech you of your mercy that
ye will forgive it her, and as for my part, God forgive it her, and I
do; and so much it liked your highness to grant me my boon, for God’s
love I require you hold your promise.’</p>
<p>‘Sithen it is so,’ said the king, ‘I will that ye have her life.
Then,’ said the king, ‘I give her to you, and go ye to the fire and take
her, and do with her what ye will.’</p>
<p>So Sir Tristram went to the fire, and by the commandment of the king
delivered her from the death. But after that King Meliodas would never
have ado with her as at bed and board. But by the good means of young
Tristram he made the king and her accorded. But then the king would not
suffer young Tristram to abide no longer in his court.</p>
<p>eft: afterwards.</p>
