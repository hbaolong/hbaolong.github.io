<h4 id="chapter-27">Chapter 27</h4>
<p>How Sir Uwain fought with two knights and overcame them</p>
<p>So was there sikerness made on both parties that no treason should be
wrought on neither party; so then the knights departed and made them
ready, and that night Sir Uwain had great cheer.</p>
<p>And on the morn he arose early and heard mass, and brake his fast,
and so he rode unto the plain without the gates, where hoved the two
brethren abiding him. So they rode together passing sore, that Sir
Edward and Sir Hugh brake their spears upon Sir Uwain. And Sir Uwain
smote Sir Edward that he fell over his horse and yet his spear brast
not. And then he spurred his horse and came upon Sir Hugh and ovethrew
him, but they soon recovered and dressed their shields and drew their
swords and bad Sir Uwain alight and do his battle to the uttemost.</p>
<p>Then Sir Uwain devoided his horse suddenly, and put his shield afore
him and drew his sword, and so they dressed together, and either gave
other such strokes, and there these two brethren wounded Sir Uwain
passing grievously that the Lady of the Rock weened he should have died.
And thus they fought together five hours as men raged out of reason. And
at the last Sir Uwain smote Sir Edward upon the helm such a stroke that
his sword carved unto his canel bone, and then Sir Hugh abated his
courage, but Sir Uwain pressed fast to have slain him. That saw Sir
Hugh; he kneeled down and yielded him to Sir Uwain. And he of his
gentleness received his sword, and took him by the hand, and went into
the castle together.</p>
<p>Then the Lady of the Rock was passing glad, and the other brother
made great sorrow for his brother’s death. Then the lady was restored of
all her lands, and Sir Hugh was commanded to be at the court of King
Arthur at the next feast of Pentecost. So Sir Uwain dwelt with the lady
nigh half a year, for it was long or he might be whole of his great
hurts.</p>
<p>And so when it drew nigh the term-day that Sir Gawain, Sir Marhaus,
and Sir Uwain should meet at the cross-way, then every knight drew him
thither to hold his promise that they had made; and Sir Marhaus and Sir
Uwain brought their damosels with them, but Sir Gawain had lost his
damosel as it is afore rehearsed.</p>
<p>sikerness: assurance. devoided: dismounted from.</p>
