<h4 id="chapter-20">Chapter 20</h4>
<p>How Sir Beaumains rode after to rescue his dwarf, and came into the
castle where he was</p>
<p>Then Sir Beaumains put on his helm anon, and buckled his shield, and
took his horse, and rode after him all that ever he might ride through
marsh, and fields, and great dales, that many times his horse and he
plunged over the head in deep mires, for he knew not the way, but took
the gainest way in that woodness, that many times he was like to perish.
And at the last him happened to come to a fair green way, and there he
met with a poor man of the country, whom he saluted and asked him
whether he met not with a knight upon a black horse and all black
harness, a little dwarf sitting behind him with heavy cheer.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said this poor man, ‘here by me came Sir Gringamore the
knight, with such a dwarf mourning as ye say; and therefore I rede you
not follow him, for he is one of the periloust knights of the world, and
his castle is here nigh hand but two mile; therefore we advise you ride
not after Sir Gringamore, but if ye owe him good will.’</p>
<p>So leave we Sir Beaumains riding towards the castle, and speak we of
Sir Gringamore and the dwarf. Anon as the dwarf was come to the castle,
Dame Lyonesse and Dame Lynet her sister, asked the dwarf where was his
master born, and of what lineage he was come. ‘And but if thou tell me,’
said Dame Lyonesse, ‘thou shalt never escape this castle, but ever here
to be prisoner.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said the dwarf, ‘I fear not greatly to tell his name
and of what kin he is come. Wit ye well be is a king’s son, and his
mother is sister to King Arthur, and he is brother to the good knight
Sir Gawain,1 and his name is Sir Gareth of Orkney. And now I have told
you his right name, I pray you, fair lady, let me go to my lord again,
for he will never out of this country until that he have me again. And
if he be angry he will do much harm or that he be stint, and work you
wrack in this country.’</p>
<p>‘As for that threating,’ said Sir Gringamore, ‘be it as it be may, we
will go to dinner.’</p>
<p>And so they washed and went to meat, and made them merry and well at
ease; because the Lady Lyonesse of the castle was there, they made great
joy.</p>
<p>‘Truly, madam,’ said Lynet unto her sister, ‘well may he be a king’s
son, for he hath many good tatches on him, for he is courteous and mild,
and the most suffering man that ever I met withal. For I dare say there
was never gentlewoman reviled man in so foul a manner as I have rebuked
him; and at all times he gave me goodly and meek answers again.’</p>
<p>And as they sat thus talking, there came Sir Gareth in at the gate
with an angry countenance, and his sword drawn in his hand, and cried
aloud that all the castle might hear it, saying, ‘Thou traitor, Sir
Gringamore, deliver me my dwarf again, or by the faith that I owe to the
order of knighthood, I shall do thee all the harm that I can.’</p>
<p>Then Sir Gringamore looked out at a window and said, ‘Sir Gareth of
Orkney, leave thy boasting words, for thou gettest not thy dwarf
again.’</p>
<p>‘Thou coward knight,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘bring him with thee, and come
and do battle with me, and win him and take him.’</p>
<p>‘So will I do,’ said Sir Gringamore, ‘and me list, but for all thy
great words thou gettest him not.’</p>
<p>‘Ah! fair brother,’ said Dame Lyonesse, ‘I would he had his dwarf
again, for I would he were not wroth, for now he hath told me all my
desire I keep no more of the dwarf. And also, brother, he hath done much
for me, and delivered me from the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and
therefore, brother, I owe him my service afore all knights living. And
wit ye well that I love him before all other, and full fain I would
speak with him. But in nowise I would that he wist what I were, but that
I were another strange lady.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Sir Gringamore, ‘sithen I know now your will, I will
obey now unto him.’</p>
<p>And right therewithal he went down unto Sir Gareth, and said, ‘Sir, I
cry you mercy, and all that I have misdone I will amend it at your will.
And therefore I pray you that ye would alight, and take such cheer as I
can make you in this castle.’</p>
<p>‘Shall I have my dwarf?’ said Sir Gareth.</p>
<p>‘Yea, sir, and all the pleasance that I can make you, for as soon as
your dwarf told me what ye were and of what blood ye are come, and what
noble deeds ye have done in these marches, then I repented of my
deeds.’</p>
<p>And then Sir Gareth alit, and there came his dwarf and took his
horse.</p>
<p>‘O my fellow,’ said Sir Gareth, ‘I have had many adventures for thy
sake.’</p>
<p>And so Sir Gringamore took him by the hand and led him into the hall
where his own wife was.</p>
<p>gainest: quickest.</p>
<p>wrack: strife.</p>
