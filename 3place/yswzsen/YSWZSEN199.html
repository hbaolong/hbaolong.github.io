<h4 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h4>
<p>How La Cote Male Taile overthrew Sir Dagonet the king’s fool, and of
the rebuke that he had of the damosel</p>
<p>Then Sir Kay ordained Sir Dagonet, King Arthur’s fool, to follow
after La Cote Male Taile; and there Sir Kay ordained that Sir Dagonet
was horsed and armed, and bad him follow La Cote Male Taile and proffer
him to joust, and so he did.</p>
<p>And when he saw La Cote Male Taile, he cried and bad him make him
ready to joust. So Sir La Cote Male Taile smote Sir Dagonet over his
horse’s croup.</p>
<p>Then the damosel mocked La Cote Male Taile, and said, ‘Fie for shame!
Now art thou shamed in Arthur’s court, when they send a fool to have ado
with thee, and specially at thy first jousts;’ thus she rode long, and
chid.</p>
<p>And within a while there came Sir Bleoberis, the good knight, and
there he jousted with La Cote Male Taile, and there Sir Bleoberis smote
him so sore, that horse and all fell to the earth. Then La Cote Male
Taile arose up lightly, and dressed his shield, and drew his sword, and
would have done battle to the utterance, for he was wood wroth.</p>
<p>‘Not so,’ said Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, ‘as at this time I will not
fight upon foot.’</p>
<p>Then the Damosel Maledisant rebuked him in the foulest manner, and
bad him: ‘Turn again, coward.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, damosel,’ he said, ‘I pray you of mercy to missay me no more, my
grief is enough though ye give me no more; I call myself never the worse
knight when a mare’s son faileth me, and also I count me never the worse
knight for a fall of Sir Bleoberis.’</p>
<p>So thus he rode with her two days; and by fortune there came Sir
Palomides and encountered with him, and he in the same wise served him
as did Bleoberis tofore hand.</p>
<p>‘What dost thou here in my fellowship?’ said the Damosel Maledisant,
‘Thou canst not sit no knight, nor withstand him one buffet, but if it
were Sir Dagonet.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, fair damosel, I am not the worse to take a fall of Sir
Palomides, and yet great disworship have I none, for neither Bleoberis
nor yet Palomides would not fight with me on foot.’</p>
<p>‘As for that,’ said the damosel, ‘wit thou well they have disdain and
scorn to light off their horses to fight with such a lewd knight as thou
art.’</p>
<p>So in the meanwhile there came Sir Mordred, Sir Gawain’s brother, and
so he fell in the fellowship with the Damosel Maledisant.</p>
<p>And then they came afore the Castle Orgulous, and there was such a
custom that there might no knight come by that castle but other he must
joust or be prisoner, or at the least to lose his horse and his
harness.</p>
<p>And there came out two knights against them, and Sir Mordred jousted
with the foremost, and that knight of the castle smote Sir Mordred down
off his horse. And then La Cote Male Taile jousted with the other, and
either of them smote other down, horse and all, to the earth. And when
they avoided their horses, then either of them took other’s horses.</p>
<p>And then La Cote Male Taile rode unto that knight that smote down Sir
Mordred, and jousted with him. And there Sir La Cote Male Taile hurt and
wounded him passing sore, and put him from his horse as he had been
dead. So he turned unto him that met him afore, and he took the flight
toward the castle, and Sir La Cote Male Taile rode after him into the
Castle Orgulous, and there La Cote Male Taile slew him.</p>
