<h4 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h4>
<p>How Sir Tristram and King Mark hurted each other for the love of a
knight’s wife</p>
<p>So Sir Tristram departed, and took the sea, and with good wind he
arrived up at Tintagel in Cornwall. And when King Mark was whole in his
prosperity there came tidings that Sir Tristram was arrived, and whole
of his wounds: thereof was King Mark passing glad, and so were all the
barons. And when he saw his time he rode unto his father, King Meliodas,
and there he had all the cheer that the king and the queen could make
him. And then largely King Meliodas and his queen departed of their
lands and goods to Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>Then by the license of King Meliodas, his father, he returned again
unto the court of King Mark, and there he lived in great joy long time,
until at the last there befell a jealousy and an unkindness betwixt King
Mark and Sir Tristram, for they loved both one lady. And she was an
earl’s wife that hight Sir Segwarides. And this lady loved Sir Tristram
passingly well. And he loved her again, for she was a passing fair lady,
and that espied Sir Tristram well. Then King Mark understood that and
was jealous, for King Mark loved her passingly well.</p>
<p>So it fell upon a day this lady sent a dwarf unto Sir Tristram, and
bad him, as he loved her, that he would be with her the night next
following. ‘Also she charged you that ye come not to her but if ye be
well armed, for her lord was called a good knight.’</p>
<p>Sir Tristram answered to the dwarf, ‘Recommend me unto my lady, and
tell her I will not fail but I will be with her the term that she hath
set me.’</p>
<p>And with this answer the dwarf departed. And King Mark espied that
the dwarf was with Sir Tristram upon message from Segwarides’ wife; then
King Mark sent for the dwarf, and when he was comen he made the dwarf by
force to tell him all, why and wherefore that he came on message from
Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>‘Now,’ said King Mark, ‘go where thou wilt, and upon pain of death
that thou say no word that thou spakest with me.’</p>
<p>So the dwarf departed from the king. And that same night that the
Steven was set betwixt Segwarides’ wife and Sir Tristram, King Mark
armed him, and made him ready, and took two knights of his council with
him; and so he rode afore for to abide by the way, for to a wait upon
Sir Tristram.</p>
<p>And as Sir Tristram came riding upon his way with his spear in his
hand, King Mark came hurtling upon him with his two knights suddenly.
And all three smote him with their spears, and King Mark hurt Sir
Tristram on the breast right sore. And then Sir Tristram fewtered his
spear, and smote his uncle, King Mark, so sore, that he rashed him to
the earth, and bruised him that he lay still in a swoon, and long it was
or ever he might wield himself. And then he ran to the one knight, and
eft to the other, and smote them to the cold earth, that they lay
still.</p>
<p>And therewithal Sir Tristram rode forth sore wounded to the lady, and
found her abiding him at a postern.</p>
<p>at most and least: of everyone.</p>
<p>steven: assignation. rashed: dragged.</p>
