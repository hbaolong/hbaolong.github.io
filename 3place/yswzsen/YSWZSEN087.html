<h4 id="chapter-25">Chapter 25</h4>
<p>How Sir Marhaus fought with the duke and his six sons and made them
to yield them</p>
<p>Then came the four sons by couple, and two of them brake their
spears, and so did the other two. And all this while Sir Marhaus touched
them not. Then Sir Marhaus ran to the duke, and smote him with his spear
that horse and man fell to the earth, and so he served his sons; and
then Sir Marhaus alit down and bad the duke yield him or else he would
slay him.</p>
<p>And then some of his sons recovered, and would have set upon Sir
Marhaus; then Sir Marhaus said to the duke, ‘Cease thy sons, or else I
will do the uttermost to you all.’</p>
<p>Then the duke saw he might not escape the death, he cried to his
sons, and charged them to yield them to Sir Marhaus; and they kneeled
all down and put the pommels of their swords to the knight, and so he
received them. And then they halp up their father, and so by their
communal assent promised to Sir Marhaus never to be foes unto King
Arthur, and thereupon at Whitsuntide after, to come, he and his sons,
and put them in the king’s grace.</p>
<p>Then Sir Marhaus departed, and within two days his damosel brought
him whereas was a great tournament that the Lady de Vawse had cried. And
who that did best should have a rich circlet of gold worth a thousand
bezants. And there Sir Marhaus did so nobly that he was renowned, and
had sometime down forty knights, and so the circlet of gold was rewarded
him.</p>
<p>Then he departed from thence with great worship; and so within seven
nights his damosel brought him to an earl’s place, his name was the Earl
Fergus, that after was Sir Tristram’s knight; and this earl was but a
young man, and late come into his lands, and there was a giant fast by
him that hight Taulurd, and he had another brother in Cornwall that
hight Taulas, that Sir Tristram slew when he was out of his mind. So
this earl made his complaint unto Sir Marhaus, that there was a giant by
him that destroyed all his lands, and how he durst nowhere ride nor go
for him.</p>
<p>‘Sir,’ said the knight, ‘whether useth he to fight, on horseback or
on foot?’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said the earl, ‘there may no horse bear him.’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ said Sir Marhaus, ‘then will I fight with him on foot.’</p>
<p>So on the morn Sir Marhaus prayed the earl that one of his men might
bring him whereas the giant was; and so he was, for he saw him sit under
a tree of holly, and many clubs of iron and gisarmes about him.</p>
<p>So this knight dressed him to the giant, putting his shield afore
him, and the giant took an iron club in his hand, and at the first
stroke he clave Sir Marhaus’ shield in two pieces. And there he was in
great peril, for the giant was a wily fighter, but at last Sir Marhaus
smote off his right arm above the elbow. Then the giant fled and the
knight after him, and so he drove him into a water, but the giant was so
high that he might not wade after him. And then Sir Marhaus made the
Earl Fergus’ man to fetch him stones, and with those stones the knight
gave the giant many sore knocks, till at the last he made him fall down
into the water, and so was he there dead.</p>
<p>Then Sir Marhaus went unto the giant’s castle, and there he delivered
twenty-four ladies and twelve knights out of the giant’s prison, and
there he had great riches without number, so that the days of his life
he was never poor man. Then he returned to the Earl Fergus, the which
thanked him greatly, and would have given him half his lands, but he
would none take.</p>
<p>So Sir Marhaus dwelled with the earl nigh half a year, for he was
sore bruised with the giant, and at the last he took his leave. And as
he rode by the way, he met with Sir Gawain and Sir Uwain, and so by
adventure he met with four knights of Arthur’s court, the first was Sir
Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Ozana, Sir Dodinas le Savage, and Sir Felot
of Listinoise; and there Sir Marhaus with one spear smote down these
four knights, and hurt them sore. So he departed to meet at his day
aforeset.</p>
<p>bezants: gold coins, gisarmes: battle-axes.</p>
