Quality of Life</h4>
<p>The Changed of “Social Responsibility”—What Explains It? —The Price
of Suc- cess—The Disenchantment with Government—The New Leadership
Groups—Why Public Relations Are Inadequate—Three Cautionary Tales—Union
Carbide and Vi- enna, West Virginia—Swift do Argentina and Deltec—Civil
Rights and the Quaker Conscience—Social Responsibilities Have to Be
Managed</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>HE “SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF BUSINESS” have been discussed for a
cen- tury. Indeed, a chapter or two on social responsibility—or some
similar heading can be found in almost any text on general
management.</p>
<p>But since the early sixties the meaning of the words “social
responsibility of business”</p>
<p>has changed radically.</p>
<p>Earlier discussions of social responsibilities of business centered
in three areas. One was the perennial question of the relationship
between private ethics and public ethics. To what extent is a manager in
charge of an organization beholden to the ethics of the indi- vidual and
to what extent does his responsibility to the organization permit him—or
per- haps even compel him—to resort to privately unethical behavior for
the good of his or- ganization? The text for this discussion,
consciously or not, is an old epigram of the poli- ticians: “What
scoundrels we would be if we did in our private lives what we do in our
public capacity for our countries.”</p>
<p>The second major topic was the social responsibility which the
employer bears toward his employees by virtue of his power and wealth.
The classic discussion is to be found in a book by the English Quaker
industrialist and philanthropist B. Seebohm Rowntree, The Human Needs of
Labor (1918).</p>
<p>Finally, social responsibility was the term used to assert—or
assign—leadership re- sponsibility of the businessman with respect to
the “culture” of the community: support of the arts, the museums, the
opera, and the symphony orchestra; service as a trustee on the boards of
educational and religious institutions, and also giving money to
philanthropic and other community causes. And in the United States in
particular, willingness to serve in governmental or quasi-governmental
positions has become in this century an important social responsibility
of the executive.</p>
<p>By and large the traditional approach was not concerned, as it
claimed to be, with the social responsibility of business but with the
social responsibility of businessmen. And the greatest emphasis was put
on what businessmen should or might contribute outside of business hours
and outside their businesses.</p>
<p>After World War II there was increasing emphasis on the contribution
of business.</p>
<p>But this was a result of tax laws which, on the one hand, slowed down
the accumulation of large fortunes by individuals, and on the other
hand, encouraged and made highly at- tractive charitable contributions
on the part of a company. The emphasis otherwise re- mained unchanged.
Where an earlier generation had looked to the “rich businessman” to
endow a hospital, post-World War II big business was expected to support
worthy causes.</p>
<p>Emphasis was still on outside “causes” rather than on the behavior
and actions of business itself.</p>
<p>Some earlier writers took a broader view. Eiichi Shibusawa in the
Japan of early and mid-Meiji, that is, before 1900, and Walter Rathenau
in Germany in the years before World War I wrote extensively on the
relationship between business, especially large business, and the
society around it. But even Shibusawa and Rathenau were mainly con-
cerned with setting limits to business and with making business and
businessmen fit them- selves to social and community values.</p>
<p>When social responsibilities are being discussed these days, however,
the emphasis is quite different. It is on what business should or might
do to tackle and solve problems of society. The emphasis is on the
contribution business can make to such social problems as racial
discrimination and racial integration in the United States, or on the
maintenance and restoration of the physical environment. One of the best
examples of the new attitude comes from Sweden.</p>
<p>Several large Swedish companies, especially ASEA, the big
electrical-apparatus com- pany, were harshly attacked in the late
sixties in the Swedish press for participating in a major electric-power
project in Africa. The project was sponsored by the UN and fi- nanced by
the World Bank; it also had been endorsed by the socialist government of
Sweden. Its purpose was to raise the living standards of a desperately
poor region of Black Africa. But it was located in a Portuguese colony.
Hence, it was vehemently ar- gued, the Swedish companies participating
in it “supported colonialism” by helping to raise the standards of
living of the native population. It was their duty, so the argument ran,
to work for the “downfall of colonialism,” which would best be achieved
by keeping the natives desperately poor rather than have them prosper
under an “imperialist ex- ploiter.”</p>
<p>The most extreme assertion of social responsibilities of business is
perhaps a state- ment made during the sixties by the Mayor of New York
City, John Lindsay.</p>
<p>The Mayor called on the big corporations of New York City to “adopt”
a Black ghetto neighborhood and to make sure that the people in that
neighborhood would have the ne- cessities of life, would get education,
and would get jobs. He then added that he hoped that these major
corporations would also make sure that each Black family had a man in
the house who would be husband to the wife and father to the
children.</p>
<p>Only ten years earlier one could not have imagined anyone, not even
the most extreme “leftist” of “progressive,” berating business for its
refusal to nullify the foreign policy of its own government (and a
socialist one to boot) or for shunning paternalistic control over the
sex life of citizens who were not even employees.</p>
<p>This new concept of social responsibility no longer asks what the
limitations on busi- ness are, or what business should be doing for
those under its immediate authority. It de- mands that business take
responsibility for social problems, social issues, social and po-
litical goals, and that it become the keeper of society’s conscience and
the solver of soci- ety’s problems.</p>
<p>But increasingly such social responsibility is also being demanded of
non-business in- stitutions in society. Universities, hospitals, and
government agencies, but also learned societies, whether of physicists,
historians, or linguists, are all increasingly being con- fronted with
similar demands and attacked for not assuming responsibility for
society’s ills and problems.</p>
<p>In the early sixties student riots against the university arose out
of student grievances.</p>
<p>But the student riots of 1968 that almost destroyed Columbia
University in New York City were sparked by complaints that the
university had failed to take full social responsi- bility for the
neighboring Black community of Harlem and had failed to subordinate its
own educational goals to the alleged needs of Harlem’s hard-core
unemployables.</p>
<p>What Explains It?</p>
<p>The most popular and most obvious explanation is the wrong one. It is
not hostility to business that explains the surge of demands for social
responsibility On the contrary it is the success of the business system
which leads to new and, in many cases, exaggerated expectations. The
demand for social responsibility is, in large measure, the price of suc-
cess.</p>
<p>In developed countries we now take economic performance for granted.
This has 1ed to the belief that there is, or should be, universal
capacity for economic performance. It has led us to believe that the
same efforts which, within a century, lifted one-third of hu- manity
from poverty into affluence can in much less time raise the remaining
two-thirds of mankind into affluence, or can at least bring them into
rapid economic development.</p>
<p>Less than two generations ago, in the years around World War I,
poverty was still taken for granted as the universal condition of
mankind. No one then assumed economic development to be the rule. It was
considered an exception. What was considered surpris- ing in 1900, or
even in 1950, was not that India remained poor. Indeed anyone who would
then have talked about the economic development of India would have been
considered inane. What was exceptional, and truly surprising, was that
Japan had managed to break out of the all but universal poverty of
mankind and to start on the road to development. Today lack of
development is considered the exception and the “problem.” And no matter
how rapid development is—e.g., in Brazil since World War II—it is
considered inade- quate because it does not transform an entire country,
within one generation, from ex- treme misery to comfortable
affluence.</p>
<p>No one, only two generations ago, expected poverty to disappear, even
in the devel- oped and wealthy countries at that time. Few people today
would believe the descriptions and illustrations in the first systematic
survey of the poor in what was then the world’s richest city, London,
which Charles Booth published just before the turn of the century.* Only
the horror stories that come out of Calcutta equal them today. Yet, to
contemporar- ies, the London poor of the 1890s seemed so affluent by
comparison with the conditions described and illustrated twenty years
earlier,† that Marx’s partner, Friedrich Engels, in reissuing in 1896
his earlier The Conditions of the Working Classes in England, was forced
to admit that his and Marx’s earlier prophecy of the increasing
“pauperization” of the “proletariat” could no longer be maintained.</p>
<p>In particular, the poverty that is most offensive to us today, that
is, poverty in the midst of affluence, was then taken for granted. No
one in the nineteenth or early twentieth centuries expected
pre-industrial immigrants into the industrial cities to be other than
poor, destitute, incompetent, and wretched. No one expected a rapid
transformation of the slums of industrial Lancashire or of the
industrializing Vienna in Austria around 1900. All anyone expected was a
little humanity to assuage the worst of the suffering, and a little
charity. At best there were attempts to help a few of unusual endowment
and personal ambition to raise themselves out of the slough of despond.
To the orthodox Marxist even this was sentimental romanticism. Following
his master he considered these people Lum- penproletariat and incapable
of improving themselves either individually or collectively.</p>
<p>Nothing in earlier social and economic history equals the recent
economic and social development of the American Negro. Within twenty
years, from 1950 to 1970, two-thirds of one of the least prepared and
most disadvantaged of pre-industrial immigrants into modern civilization
have risen from extreme poverty into middle-class status. They have
acquired competence and jobs. A larger proportion of their children
acquire higher educa- tion than of the children of older immigrant
groups in the city, such as Italians or Poles who encounter no “racial”
barrier.</p>
<p>Admittedly the American Negro is a very special problem. But still,
the difference be- tween what was considered success only a half century
ago and what is now considered</p>
<p>*Charles Booth, Life and Labour of the People in London, published
between 1892 and 1897.</p>
<p>†For instance by Charles Dickens the Younger, in his famous
Dictionary of London, first published in 1879 and intended as a guide to
“enjoyment” for the tourist visiting the city.</p>
<p>grim failure illustrates the extent to which success has changed
expectations. Even rather well-to-do “middle-class” people yesterday had
only little of the qualities of life we now expect routinely.</p>
<p>The apartment buildings of the late nineteenth century still stand in
most European cit- ies. They are hardly “good housing”—airless and dark,
with mean little flats, five floors high without elevator, heating—a
coal or wood stove—only in the “parlor,” and with one tiny, grimy
bathroom for a family of seven. Yet they were built for the new middle
classes. Health care was almost nonexistent, education beyond the
elementary level a privilege of the few, the newspaper a luxury. And no
matter how serious an environmental problem the automobile poses in
today’s big city, the horse was dirtier, smelled worse, killed and
maimed more people, and congested the streets just as much.</p>
<p>And life on the farm, that is, life for the great majority, was, if
anything, poorer, dirt- ier, more dangerous to life and limb, and more
brutish.</p>
<p>As late as 1900 or 1914 quality of life was a concern only of the few
rich. To all the others it was “escapism” that could be permitted in the
syrupy romances that sold by the millions and were devoured alike by
servant girls and their “ladies.” Reality, however, was the numbing
daily struggle for a little food, a dreary job and enough money to pay
the premium on burial insurance.</p>
<p>That we can worry about the qualities of life is thus very great
success. And it is only right and natural that the same leadership
groups which were responsible for the success in providing the
quantities of life are expected to assume responsibility now for
providing the quality of life.</p>
<p>The same reason explains the demand for social responsibility on the
part of the uni- versity. For the university too is a success story of
the twentieth century.</p>
<p>“If science can tell us how to put a man on the moon,” the student
activists of the six- ties said again and again, “it surely can tell us
how to create a decent environment, save our cities from drugs, make
marriages happy and children enjoy school. If it doesn’t, the only
explanation must be ‘wrong value priorities’ or malicious
conspiracy.”</p>
<p>To be sure, these arguments are naive. But they are not irrational.
The clamor for so- cial responsibility expects too much. But it expects
the right things. Its root is not hostility to authority, but
overconfidence in managers and management.</p>
<p>The Disenchantment with Government</p>
<p>On top of this comes the growing disenchantment with government, the
growing disbelief in government’s ability to solve major social
problems.*</p>
<p>Only a generation ago the people who now demand social responsibility
from business (or the university) expected government to be able to take
care of every problem of soci- ety, if not of every problem of the
individual as well. There is still, in all countries, pres- sure for
more and more government programs—though there is also growing
resistance to more and more expenditures and taxes. But even the most
fervent advocate of an activist government no longer truly expects
results, even in countries where respect for and belief in government
are still high, such as in Japan, Sweden, and Germany. Even the most
fer- vent advocate of a strong government no longer believes that a
problem has been solved the moment it has been turned over to
government. As a result, the people most concerned with these problems,
the liberals and progressives who, a generation ago, rallied under the
banner of “more government,” now increasingly look to other leadership
groups, other institutions, and, above all, to business, to take on the
problems which government should but is not able to solve.</p>
<p>Robert Kennedy, rather than the National Association of
Manufacturers, proposed that the rehabilitation of the slums in the big
American cities be taken on by business. And one of the staunchest and
most respected advocates of government activism, and America’s leading
labor union theoretician, the late Frank Tannenbaum of Columbia
University, at</p>
<p>*On this see also Chapter 10, “The Sickness of Govemment,” in my
book, The Age of Discontinuity.</p>
<p>the very end of his life, in the spring of 1968, proclaimed (in the
Journal of World Busi- ness, published by Columbia University) that the
multinational corporation was “the last best hope” and the only
foundation of a peaceful world.</p>
<p>The New Leadership Groups</p>
<p>Altogether it is the succession of management to the leadership
position in society that underlies the demands for social
responsibility.</p>
<p>In this century the managers of our major institutions have become
the leaders in every developed country, and in most developing countries
as well. The old leadership groups, whether the aristocracy or the
priesthood, have either disappeared entirely or have become
insignificant. Even the scientists, the priesthood of the post-World War
II period, have lost much of their prestige. The only new leadership
groups to emerge are managers, managers of business enterprise and of
universities, of government agencies and of hospi- tals. They command
the resources of society. But they also command the competence. It is,
therefore, only logical that they are expected to take the leadership
role and take re- sponsibility for major social problems and major
social issues.</p>
<p>As a result of these shifts—the emergence of managers as the major
leadership group; the growing disenchantment with government, and the
shift in focus from the quantities of life to the quality of life—the
demand has arisen that managers, and especially business managers, make
concern for society central to the conduct of business itself. It is a
de- mand that the quality of life become the business of business. The
traditional approach asks, “How can we arrange the making of cars (or of
shoes) so as not to impinge on social values and beliefs, on individuals
and their freedom, and on the good society altogether?” The new demand
is for business to make social values and beliefs, create freedom for
the individual, and produce the good society.</p>
<p>This demand requires new thinking and new action on the part of the
managers. It cannot be handled in the traditional manner. It cannot be
handled by public relations.</p>
<p>Public relations asks whether a business or an industry is “liked” or
“understood.”</p>
<p>Public relations would therefore be worried that Black Power
advocates blame the profit motive for the ghetto, and that they
presumably like business just as little as they like any other part of
the white establishment. But what really matters is that the Black Power
leaders expect business to perform miracles with respect to ghetto
employment, ghetto education, ghetto housing; and they expect these
miracles virtually overnight. The rele- vant questions are: “Can
business tackle these huge problems? How? Should business tackle them?”
These are not questions which public-relations is equipped to
handle.</p>
<p>Three Cautionary Tales</p>
<p>Books and magazines these days are full of horror stories of
“business irresponsibility,” of “greed,” and “incompetence.” There is no
doubt that there are irresponsible, greedy, and incompetent managers and
businesses. Managers, after all, are members of the human race. But the
real problems of social responsibility are not irresponsibility, greed,
and incompetence. If they were, the problem would be easy. One could
then set forth stan- dards of conduct and hold business to them.
Unfortunately the basic problems of social responsibility are different.
They are problems of good intentions, honorable conduct, and high
responsibility—gone wrong.</p>
<p>This can be illustrated by three “cautionary tales.”</p>
<p>Union Carbide and Vienna, West Virginia</p>
<p>West Virginia, never one of the more prosperous areas of the United
States, went into rapid economic decline in the late twenties as the
coal industry, long the state’s mainstay, began to shrink. The decline
of the coal industry was hastened by rising concern with mine accidents
and miners diseases. For many of the coal mines of West Virginia were
small and marginal and could not afford modern safety precautions or
adequate health protection.</p>
<p>By the late 1940s the leading industrial company in the state became
alarmed over the steady economic shrinkage of the region. Union Carbide,
one of America’s major chemi- cal companies, had its headquarters in New
York. But the original plants of the company had been based on West
Virginia coal, and the company was still the largest employer in the
state, other than a few large coal mines. Accordingly, the company’s top
management asked a group of young engineers and economists in its employ
to prepare a plan for the creation of employment opportunities in West
Virginia, and especially for the location of the company’s new plant
facilities in areas of major unemployment in the state. For the worst
afflicted area, however, the westernmost corner of the state on the
border of Ohio, the planners could not come up with an attractive
project. Yet this area needed jobs the most. In and around the little
town of Vienna, West Virginia, there was total unemploy- ment, and no
prospects for new industries. The only plant that could possibly be put
in the Vienna area was a ferroalloy plant using a process that had
already become obsolete and had heavy cost disadvantages compared to
more modern processes such as Union Car- bide’s competitors were already
using.</p>
<p>Even for the old process, Vienna was basically an uneconomical
location. The process required very large amounts of coal of fair
quality. But the only coal available within the area was coal of such
high sulfur content that it could not be used without expensive
treatment and scrubbing. Even then—that is, after heavy capital
investment—the process was inherently noisy and dirty, releasing large
amounts of fly ash and of noxious gases.</p>
<p>In addition, the only transportation facilities, both rail and road,
were not in West Virignia but across the river, on the Ohio side.
Putting the plant there, however, meant that the prevailing westerly
winds would blow the soot from the smokestacks and the sul- fur released
by the power plants directly into the town of Vienna, on the other bank
of the river.</p>
<p>Yet the Vienna plant would provide 1,500 jobs in Vienna itself and
another 500 to 1,000 jobs in a new coal field not too far distant. In
addition, the new coal field would be capable of being strip-mined, so
the new mining jobs would be free from the accident and health hazards
that had become increasingly serious in the old and worked-out coal
mines of the area. Union Carbide top management came to the conclusion
that social responsi- bility demanded building the new plant, despite
its marginal economics.</p>
<p>The plant was built with the most up-to-date antipollution equipment
known at the time. Whereas even big-city power stations were then
content to trap half the fly ash es- caping their smokestacks, the
Vienna plant installed scrubbers to catch 75 percent— though there was
little anyone could do about the sulfur dioxide fumes emitted by the
high-sulfur coal.</p>
<p>When the plant was opened in 1951, Union Carbide was the hero.
Politicians, public figures, educators, all praised the company for its
social responsibility. But ten years later the former savior was fast
becoming the public enemy. As the nation became pollution- conscious,
the citizens of Vienna began to complain more and more bitterly about
the ash, the soot, and the fumes that floated across the river into
their town and homes. About 1961 a new mayor was elected on the platform
“fight pollution,” which meant “fight Un- ion Carbide.” Ten years later
the plant had become a “national scandal.” Even Business Week—hardly a
publication hostile to business—chastised Union Carbide (in February,
1971) in an article entitled “A Corporate Polluter Learns the Hard
Way.”</p>
<p>There is little doubt that Union Carbide’s management did not behave
very intelli- gently. They should have realized in the early sixties
that they were in trouble, rather than delay and procrastinate, make and
then break promises—until the citizens, the state gov- ernment, the
press, the environmentalists, and the federal government all were aiming
their biggest guns at the company. It was not very smart to protest for
years that there was nothing wrong with the plant and then, when
governmental authorities began to get nasty, announce that the plant
would have to be closed as it could not be brought up to environ- mental
standards.</p>
<p>Yet this is not the basic lesson of this cautionary tale. Once the
decision had been made to employ an obsolescent process and to build an
economically marginal plant in</p>
<p>order to alleviate unemployment in a bitterly depressed area, the
rest followed more or less automatically. This decision meant that the
plant did not generate the revenues needed to be rebuilt. There is very
little doubt that on economic reasoning alone the plant would never have
been built. Public opinion forced Union Carbide to invest substantial
sums in that plant to remedy the worst pollution problems—though it is
questionable whether the technology exists to do more than a patch-up
job. Publicity also forced Union Carbide to keep the plant open. But,
once the spotlight shifts elsewhere, most of the jobs in the Vienna,
West Virginia, plant are likely to disappear again, if indeed the plant
re- mains open at all.</p>
<p>Swift do Argentina and Deltec</p>
<p>The Swift meat-packing plant in the Buenos Aires port district has
been the largest meat- packing plant in Argentina for many years. It has
also been a major employer in a poor area of Buenos Aires. Originally a
subsidiary of Swift of Chicago, the company became independent, though
still under American ownership, shortly after World War II.</p>
<p>But the Argentineans meat-packing industry fell on evil days after
World War II—in part because of government measures that have been
driving up the price of Argentinean cattle, while cutting down the
supply, thus making Argentinean beef increasingly non- competitive in
the world market and depriving meat-packers of their source of raw mate-
rials. Swift became increasingly unprofitable. The owners finally sold
out in 1968 to a Canadian-based “multinational,” Deltec, a company that
is active in many parts of Latin America, primarily in financial service
businesses. Deltec promptly started to modernize the Swift plant to make
it competitive again. But the Argentinean meat-packing industry
continued on its decline.</p>
<p>Swift’s two major competitors, both foreign-owned, decided in the
late sixties to close down. They paid off the workers according to
Argentinean law and went out of business. Deltec, however, decided that
it could not afford to do this in view of its many other in- terests in
Latin America. It had to maintain employment in an area where
unemployment was far too high anyhow. Deltec worked out an agreement
with the labor unions under which employment was substantially cut and
productivity greatly improved. The company poured substantial amounts of
money into the plant and used its financial connections to obtain
foreign bank loans for it. Still the meat business in Argentina did not
improve.</p>
<p>By 1971 Swift had used up all the capital Deltec could make available
to it and was still not back on a profitable and competitive basis.
Thereupon Swift worked out a volun- tary agreement with the creditors,
including the company’s workers, for full repayment of all debts over an
extended period—with Deltec being the last creditor to receive any
payment. Eighty-six percent of the creditors, far more than required by
law, accepted this agreement. But to everyone’s surprise the Argentinean
judge, whose approval had been expected as a mere formality, turned the
agreement down. He decided that Deltec had obtained it improperly,
declared Swift do Argentina bankrupt, ordered its liquidation, and asked
the Argentinean government to appoint a liquidator. In effect he
expropriated the company and its property. He not only refused to
recognize any rights of Deltec as a creditor but decided that all Deltec
holdings in other Argentinean companies be im- pounded as security for
Swift’s debts to Argentinean creditors.</p>
<p>There was no public pressure for such an action—and no legal pressure
either. The Swift workers, although members of the most militant of
Argentinean unions, fully sup- ported Deltec. Yet the decision found
tremendous approval in Argentina, even among people who by no stretch of
the imagination could be considered anti-business or even anti-American.
“The other foreign-owned meat-packers;” a good many people said, “did
the right thing in closing down their plants and paying off their
workers when they could no longer operate economically. Deltec, by
trying to keep going, raised expectations which it then cruelly had to
disappoint.”</p>
<p>Civil Rights and the Quaker Conscience</p>
<p>In the late 1940s a major American steel company appointed a new
general manager for its large southern division, located in one of the
most strongly “white supremacy” areas in the South. Traditionally, all
top management positions in that division had been held by Southerners.
The new appointee was a Northerner. Moreover, he was a scion of one of
the old Philadelphia Quaker families and had been active in several
civil rights organizations.</p>
<p>Upon his appointment top management called him in and said, “We know
what we are doing and why we are appointing you. To be sure, your
performance has earned this pro- motion. But you are also a Northerner
and committed to employment equality for the Black man. And this, of
course, is what both the laws of the United States and our union
contract demand of us. Yet, as we all know, our southern division has
never given em- ployment opportunities to Blacks. No Black, however
skilled, no matter what his job, has ever been paid more than ‘helper’s’
wages. We have never been able to make a dent in this down south. But we
know that we will not be able much longer to defend and to keep up these
practices. We expect you, therefore, to move as fast as you can for
civil rights for our Negro employees, as the laws of the country and our
union contract demand. Try to get the support and cooperation of the top
people in the union which represents our work- ers. We know that you
have been working with them in several civil rights organizations.”</p>
<p>The new general manager spent about a year getting accepted by his
new associates, getting known in the local community, and establishing
friendly relations with the union leaders in the mill. Then he saw his
opportunity. A new major extension to the mill was about to be opened,
and a number of new furnaces had to manned. The new general man- ager
strictly applied the hiring provisions of the union contract. As a
result, a small but still substantial number of Black workers with high
job skills and considerable seniority got positions on the new crews. In
no case was a white worker deprived of his seniority rights or put under
a Black man as his supervisor.</p>
<p>The morning after the new manning tables had been posted, as required
by the union contract, a delegation of local union leaders called on the
general manager. “You know that there are several hundred grievances,”
they said, “which have been pending for far too long a time without a
settlement. The patience of our men is exhausted. We are going out on
strike in thirty-six hours. But we don’t want to be unreasonable. If the
company makes even a token gesture of goodwill, we will postpone this
strike. All you have to do is to suspend those manning tables you just
posted, and let us, together with the supervi- sors, work out the
composition of the crews for the new furnaces. In the meantime, here is
the official strike notice as required by our contract.”</p>
<p>The general manager first tried to reach the president and the
general counsel of the union. Unaccountably, neither could be found, nor
did their secretaries know where they could be reached or when they
would return. Then the general manager bethought himself of an old
friend, one of the “sages” of the Quakers and a “radical” on race
relations, and especially on employment opportunities for Blacks. But to
the general manager’s im- mense surprise, the “sage” was not one bit
sympathetic with his plight. “I fully agree with you, as you know, in
considering employment discrimination against the Negro to be ille- gal,
immoral, and sinful,” the sage said. “But what you have done, while
legal, is just as immoral. You have used the economic muscle of a big
company to impose your mores and values on the community in which you
operate. Yours are the right mores and the right values. But, still, you
are using the economic power of a business, the power of the employer,
and the authority of your office to dictate to the community. This is
‘economic imperialism’ and it cannot be condoned, no matter how good the
cause.”</p>
<p>The general manager resigned and took another job up north. The
company quietly dropped the manning tables. The mills remained open. And
a few years later, needless to say, the company came under bitter
attack—in which the union’s general counsel joined loudly—for its
failure to take leadership in race matters. As the biggest employer in
the community, the critics charged, the company had a social
responsibility not to condone practices which it must have known to be
both illegal and immoral.</p>
<p>Clearly, the demand for social responsibility is not as simple as
most books, articles, and speeches on the subject make it out to be. But
it is not possible to disregard it, as such distinguished economists as
Milton Friedman of Chicago have urged. To be sure, Fried- man’s argument
that business is an economic institution and should stick to its
economic task is well taken. There is danger that social responsibility
will undermine economic per- formance and with it society altogether.
There is surely an even greater danger that social responsibility will
mean usurpation of power by business managers in areas in which they
have no legitimate authority.*</p>
<p>But it is also clear that social responsibility cannot be evaded. It
is not only that the public demands it. It is not only that society
needs it. The fact remains that in modern society there is no other
leadership group but managers. If the managers of our major in-
stitutions, and especially of business, do not take responsibility for
the common good, no one else can or will. Government—is no longer
capable, as political theories still have it, of being the “sovereign”
and the “guardian of the common good” in a pluralist society of
organizations. The leadership groups in this society, and this means the
managers of the key institutions, whether they like it or not—indeed
whether they are competent or not— have to think through what
responsibilities they can and should assume, in what areas, and for what
objectives.</p>
<p>If there is one moral to these cautionary tales, it is not that
social responsibility is both ambiguous and dangerous. It is that social
impacts and social responsibilities are areas in which business—and not
only big business—has to think through its role, has to set ob-
jectives, has to perform. Social impacts and social responsibilities
have to be managed.</p>
