the Small, the Fair-Sized, the Big Business</h4>

Three Categories: Small, Fair-Sized, and Big—Managing the Small
Business—The Need for a Distinct Niche— Structuring the Top-Management

Becoming Inbred—The Danger of Exclusive “Promotion from Within” —Size as
a Top-Management Challenge</p>
<p>How Big Is Big?</p>
<p>othing knows</p>
<p>would seem simpler than to know how big a business is. Everybody,
after all, that the corner grocery store is “small” and that the General
Electric Com-</p>
<p>pany or the Deutsche Bank is “big.” But things are by no means so
simple.</p>
<p>In 1966, the Small Business Administration, an agency of the U.S.
Government, ruled that the American Motors Company was a small business
and therefore entitled to borrow on special and highly advantageous
terms. At that time, American Motors was sixty-third in size among all
American manufacturing companies and was among the world’s one hundred
largest .manufacturing companies. It had sales of a billion dollars and
about 30,000 employees. Yet the government ruling was not entirely
irrational. In the American automobile industry, American Motors was
indeed a midget. Its sales were no more than one-twentieth of that of
the industry’s leader, General Motors. Even Chrysler, next to American
Motors smallest U.S. auto maker, had seven times the sales of American
Mo- tors. With no more than 3 or 4 percent of the American automobile
market, American Motors was so small as to be in danger of collapse.</p>
<p>American Motors was, of course, not a small business at the time, nor
is it today. It was something quite different—a big business that is the
wrong size. Yet the example shows that size is not mere quantity and
that indeed it is far from obvious in many cases what size a business
really is.</p>
<p>The traditional measurement of business size is the number of
employees. For many years the U.S. Department of Commerce in its
industry analyses defined a small business as one that has fewer than a
certain number of employees—originally around 300 to 500. The number of
employees is important. Once the number of employees goes beyond 1,000,
for instance, systematic personnel administration becomes necessary. A
business employing over 1,000 people requires policies and procedures
which are not normally</p>
<p>considered as pertaining to a small business. Yet there are
businesses that are very modest in total employment and yet are quite
clearly fair-sized, if not big businesses. And there are businesses that
are quite small in their basic management requirements and yet have many
more than 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>A management consulting firm with 300 or 400 professional consultants
working out of a dozen offices is, in terms of employees, a small
business. In terms of its management requirements, it is a very big
business indeed. A worldwide accounting firm, such as Price Waterhouse,
with 4,000 or 5,000 professional employees working in thirty
countries—or one of the multinational advertising agencies which grew so
rapidly during the 1960s—is actually a giant business. It may well be
at, if not beyond the limit of manageability, even though in terms of
employees it is medium-sized.</p>
<p>But there are also such examples as a multinational manufacturing
company, head- quartered in one of the small European countries which
manufactures and sells highly engineered precision equipment for the
heavy apparatus and machinery industry. The en- tire company has only
1,800 employees working in about ten countries, with no office or plant
having more than 300 or 400 people. Manufacturing employment is almost
minus- cule—a total of 400 men in five plants. The rest are design
engineers, service engineers, metallurgists, and so on. This company,
despite its small employment, is a fairly big busi- ness and has to be
run as such; it is complex beyond its size.</p>
<p>In contrast, there are businesses employing a great many people which
are essentially small or, at best, fair-sized companies.</p>
<p>One example is a highly specialized American company which, in a
major region of the country, has leadership position in one branch of
insurance. There are 4,000 or 5,000 people on the payroll, most of them
salesmen and claims adjusters. In its basic character- istics, however,
this is still a fairly small business. There are no more than two levels
of management, the management at the headquarters of the company, and
the general man- agers of each of the fourteen districts. The “feel” of
the company is clearly “small busi- ness.”</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce, in its automotive business, is also a small business
turning out a few thousand cars a year, with a handful of major
distributors throughout the world and with a management structure of the
utmost simplicity.</p>
<p>No other yardstick does any better than employment as a measurement
of size. Sales, for instance, while used widely, is quite misleading. A
chemical company with 0 mil- lion of sales may be a fairly big business.
A metalworking company with the same sales volume may be actually so
small as to be hardly viable.</p>
<p>Most of the sales volume of the typical chemical company is “value
added.” But the typical metalworking company tends to be an assembler
rather than a manufacturer. Two- thirds or more of its sales volume may
actually be represented by parts and supplies which it buys from
others.</p>
<p>Businesses may be very much larger and rank high in terms of sales
and yet be small or, at best, fair-sized.</p>
<p>American Home Products Company, in the 1950s, was already, in terms
of its sales, a very large company, selling then about a half a billion
dollars’ worth of goods a year. Yet the company’s top management
consisted of four men who worked practically without staff: a chairman,
a president, a financial vice-president, and a personnel vice-president.
The company had six to eight divisions, each a sizable business in its
own field, but all engaged in the same basic business, the
manufacturing, promotion, and distribution of branded products through
retail stores. It could be run as a simple, and indeed almost as a
small, business, and was run successfully in that fashion.</p>
<p>Another similar example—also from the 1950s—was the automotive
business of A.</p>
<p>O. Smith in Milwaukee, the leading supplier of passenger-car frames
to the American automobile industry. Sales of this business, then the
main division of the company, were around 00 million, with employment
well above 20,000. Yet in its “feel,” but also in its strategy and
structure, this was a fair-sized business. It required excellence in
cost control, in manufacturing, and in scheduling deliveries to the
customers and their many plants</p>
<p>scattered around the country. But, being a single-product business
with one technology, one market, and with only a handful of customers,
the business could be managed by one chief executive with all the rest
of his people functional managers or specialists. It re- quired neither
elaborate controls nor central staffs, nor any of the appurtenances of
big- ness.</p>
<p>Even for companies in the same industry sales figures are not always
a reliable indica- tor of size. One of the large American rubber
companies, for instance, used to sell the bulk of its output through its
own wholly owned retail stores. The sales figure, therefore, was based
on the retail value of its products, and especially of automobile tires.
Another leading American rubber company, however, sold practically
nothing directly to the pub- lic. It either sold tires to the automobile
companies as original equipment for new cars, or it sold tires under
“private labels” to the large petroleurn companies for distribution
through their service stations. Its sales volume, therefore, represented
manufacturer’s value, which in the rubber industry is a good deal less
than half of what the final con- sumer pays. According to its sales
figures, the second company was much smaller than the first company,
whereas in actual output, but also in return on investment, it was by
far the larger business.</p>
<p>But even “value added” is not an adequate measurement. For it can be
applied only to manufacturing companies. “Value added” is a meaningless
concept for a retail business, for a bank, for a life insurance company,
and for any other business which is not primarily engaged in
manufacturing.</p>
<p>In sum: size is a configuration rather than a single aspect of a
business. To determine whether a company is small or big, one needs to
look at a number of factors: employment, sales, value added (where
applicable), the complexity and diversity of its product range, the
number of markets it is engaged in, the complexity of its technology,
and so on. But one also has to look at the structure of the industry in
which it operates, and at its share of its markets, and a number of
other factors, none of them by itself decisive.</p>
<p>The one true expression of this configuration which is size is
management and man- agement structure. A small business is a business
which requires at most one man who does nothing but top-management work
and who is not engaged in any of the functional work required.</p>
<p>This, however, tells us what ought to be, rather than what is. A
business is not neces- sarily small because the entire top-management
task is vested in one man. It may very well be a big business that is
structured the wrong way; Henry Ford’s company was one example. In turn,
a business that has a big top-management structure may still be a small
business in which the top-management job has been misorganized. Examples
abound.</p>
<p>There is only one criterion which, with fair reliability, indicates
whether a business is small, fair-sized, or big. In a genuinely small
business, the man at the top knows who the few people are in the
organization in whom responsibility for key results rests without having
to consult the records or any of his associates. He knows what their
assignments are. He knows their backgrounds, their previous assignments,
and how well they have performed in them. He knows what they can do. He
also knows their limitations—or at least he thinks he does. And he
knows, as a rule, what their next assignment is likely to be. This, of
course, means that the key group is a small one. Regardless of title and
posi- tion, it can hardly exceed twelve to fifteen men, which is about
the largest number one man can really know and can really be familiar
with.</p>
<p>In a fair-sized business—the next and in some ways the most important
category of business—the one man at the top can no longer by himself
identify and really know every one of the truly important men in the
organization. This requires a group of three or four men together.
Typically, in the fair-sized organization, the top man, when asked to
name his key people, will bring in a few of his closest associates and
will answer the question with them collectively rather than
individually. In a fair-sized organization the number of key people who
are known to be crucial to the performance and results of the
organization may run to forty or fifty.</p>
<p>Any business in which even a small group at the top no longer knows,
without consul- tation with others or without consulting charts or
records, who the crucial people are, where they are, where they have
come from, what they are doing, and where they are likely to go, is a
big business.</p>
<p>It is this test which shows that the management consulting firm with
300 or 400 pro- fessionals on its staff is a big business. It is this
test which shows that American Home Products in the 1950s was a
fair-sized company despite its 00 million of sales. And it is this test
which also shows that the multinational precision-engineering company
men- tioned above, despite its very small employment, is close to being
a big business and has to be run as such.</p>
<p>This test is neither infallible nor precise. But it focuses on the
one and only genuine characteristic of size: the management structure it
requires.</p>
<p>Managing the Small Business</p>
<p>For a hundred years we have been told by eminent authorities that
small business is being gobbled up by the “giants” and is about to
disappear. For a hundred years this has proven to be nonsense. The small
business is doing just as well as it did a hundred years ago. The
figures show clearly that proportionately neither the importance nor the
number of small businesses—but also of big businesses—has changed very
much since 1900, despite al1 the dire prophecies of monopoly, and all
the fears of “undue concentration of economic power.”</p>
<p>Small business and big business are not alternatives. They are
complements. The big business depends on small and medium-sized
businesses, who in turn depend on a big business. (This seems to be just
as true in communist economies in which all businesses are owned and
managed by the government as it is in free-enterprise economies.) Typi-
cally, there is, for instance, a big manufacturer, say, an automobile
company such as Gen- eral Motors, Volkswagen, or Toyota. But this
company depends on a host of suppliers and subcontractors who are mostly
small or fair-sized. It depends on a host of dealers, who again are
small or fair-sized. The large retailers such as Sears, Roebuck, Marks
andandandand Spencer, and the department store chains in Japan, depend
on a host of small manufactur- ers, who in turn depend on the big stores
for access to the market. There is no economic chain in a modern economy
that is composed entirely of big businesses, but also no eco- nomic
chain that is composed entirely of small businesses. Businesses of
different sizes are interdependent, with the small ones often requiring
a large one, and the large one in turn dependent on small ones.</p>
<p>What the Small Business Needs</p>
<p>Not so long ago it was widely believed that the small business needed
little or no attention to management. Management was then thought to be
for the “big boys.” One still hears people in a small business saying,
“Management? That’s for General Electric; we are small and simple enough
to do without attention to management.” But this is delusion. The small
business needs organized and systematic management even more than the
big business. It does not need, to be sure, large central staffs. It
does not need elaborate pro- cedures and techniques in many areas. In
fact, it can afford neither large staffs nor elabo- rate procedures. But
it does need management of a high order.</p>
<p>In the first place, it needs strategy. The small business cannot
afford to become mar- ginal. Yet this is its perennial danger. It must
therefore think through a strategy which gives it distinction. It must,
to speak in biological terms, find its specific ecological niche in
which it has an advantage and can therefore withstand competition. This
specific niche may be leadership in a distinct market, whether it is
defined by geography, consumer needs, or consumer values. The strategy
may lie in a specific excellence, such as a capac- ity to give service.
Or it may lie in a specific technology.</p>
<p>An example of such an ecological niche is a small pharmaceutical
company in the United States which has more than held its own in an
industry led by multinational giants.</p>
<p>By concentrating on the need of the opthalmologist in the treatment
of his patients, and especially on the needs of the ophthalmologic
surgeon, the company has carved out an ecological niche an which, while
not without competition, it has established strong leader- ship.</p>
<p>And there is also the Checker Cab Company, which does nothing but
manufacture taxicabs for major American cities. Checker produces only
4,000 cars a year. But while American Motors with eighty times that
volume is marginal, Checker Cab is a leader.</p>
<p>The strategy of a small business may also focus on excellence in a
small but vital area of service. In a period in which the large
supermarket chains in the United States did, by and large, rather
poorly, a small number of regional chains, some in the East and some on
the West Coast, showed extraordinary results. In every case this rested
on a decision on the part of their managers to concentrate and to build
excellence in one area. Typically, one of them decided that in the vast
array of processed branded foods, it could not offer anything the giants
could not do just as well. But it could offer what the giants, by virtue
of their size, would find very difficult to offer: really first-rate
meat and truly courteous service. And these are exactly what supermarket
customers value the most.</p>
<p>But businesses that are even smaller also need a strategy and can
develop one.</p>
<p>The suburban areas surrounding the major cities of the United States
are, as a rule, oversupplied with real estate agents, most of whom just
eke out a living. But in one area, one real estate agent has developed a
small but exceedingly profitable business by think- ing through a
strategy for leadership. When he first started out around 1950, this man
took a close look at his area and found that its leading “industry” was
higher education. While many of the residents commuted into the big city
nearby, a sizable and affluent group consisted of the teachers in
twenty-odd universities and colleges, most of them small, but a few
quite large. Of all occupational groups in the United States, young
college faculty may have the highest turnover. Typically, the young
college professor takes a job for a few years, after which he moves to
another institution elsewhere. In total, the twenty col- leges and
universities in the area hire each year more than five hundred new
people, while an equal number leave. The young real estate man decided
to concentrate on this market and developed for it the services it
needs. He also realized that he could get direct access to his market
with a minimum of cost. For, of course, the names of all the new
teachers hired as well as the names of those who will be leaving at the
end of the academic year are known to the colleges many months before
they actually move. And each college is only too happy to hand over the
difficult and irritating job of finding housing for new faculty to a
reliable man. As a result this real estate agent does almost three times
the business that an office of his size usually handles and with a
minimum of expense. His total volume, about 500 to 1,000 houses a year,
is still modest, but his net profit is almost four times that of the
typical suburban realtor.</p>
<p>These, to be sure, are highly atypical examples. For the typical
small business has no strategy. The typical small business is not
“opportunistic,” it is “problematical”—it lives from problem to problem.
But the typical small business is also, as a result, not a success- ful
business. The first requirement in managing a small business is
therefore to ask and answer the question “What is our business—and what
should it be?”</p>
<p>The second requirement is that small business organize and structure
the top- management tasks. A small business is defined as a business
which requires at most one full-time top manager who does nothing else.
In fact, in most small businesses, the top man also carries some
functional responsibility and usually should do so. But this makes it
all the more necessary for the small business to identify the key
activities which are needed to attain the objectives of the business and
to make sure that they are being as- signed to somebody who is
accountable. Otherwise key activities will not be done at all.</p>
<p>Most small businesses think that they know what the key activities
are. Most small businesses also believe that they take care of the key
activities. But even superficial analysis usually reveals that they
deceive themselves. Everybody may talk about the key activities but
nobody pays much attention to them. They are seen but not perceived—and
as a result usually neglected. The need is rarely for more staff. The
need is for a little</p>
<p>thought, a little organization, and a simple reporting and control
system—no more than a checklist, perhaps—to make sure that the work is
actually being done.</p>
<p>This also means, in effect, that even a small business needs a
top-management team.</p>
<p>Most of its members will be engaged on top-management tasks
part-time. Their primary duties are likely to be functional. But the
small business, as much as any other—and per- haps more than most—needs
to make sure that its entire management group knows what the key
activities are, what the goals in each are, and who is responsible for
getting the work done.</p>
<p>Everybody in a small and highly specialized business supplying
lawn-care products, such as grass seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, to
the suburban homeowner, “knew” what the key activities were:
manufacturing and selling, obviously. But the first time that someone
asked the question, it turned out that the key activities were
different—they were research on how the consumer in the American suburb
looks at the lawn, and does the work on the lawn. It was research on
what the consumer expects and considers value. It was promotion both to
the dealer and to the consumer. It was packaging to make it possi- ble
for dealers to move the company’s products without having to “sell”
them, and so on. Nobody was surprised—in fact, it was all “obvious.” But
nobody up to that time had ac- tually taken the trouble to put down the
obvious. As a result, no one was responsible for any of the key
activities. It took little time to identify the key activities and not
much more time to make sure that each was lodged in the existing
structure and made the responsibil- ity of someone already in
management. The company itself credits its rapid growth and success, in
the years since, to its identifying the key activities and building them
into the management structure.</p>
<p>The small business has limited resources, above all, of good men.
Concentration is therefore essential to it. And unless the key
activities are clearly identified and assigned as responsibilities,
there will be diffusion of resources rather than concentration.</p>
<p>The small business needs to pay special attention to making the top
man effective.</p>
<p>Even if he is free from functional work and can devote all his time
to the top-management tasks, the load on him is likely to be heavy. He
is certain to be under relentless pressure from all kinds of
demands—from major customers and from employees; from suppliers and from
banks. Unless he takes responsibility for his own job, his energies will
not be used properly.</p>
<p>The first questions to ask are “What is the top man really good at?”
“What is it that he can do better than anybody else in the business?”
And, “What, among the things he is really good at, are crucial and are
essential to the survival and success of the business?” In the
top-management team, the specific job assignment to any one member
should, as has been said before (Chapter 50) reflect personality. The
small business needs to ask: “Which of the key activities are the ones
the top man himself should take?” Analysis of the key activities should
be impersonal and objective; but assignments, and especially the
assignment of that part which the top man himself handles, has to be
based on what the individual excels in.</p>
<p>In many small, and especially in small and growing, businesses, the
top man is criti- cized by his associates for spending his time on the
wrong things. If by that they mean that the key activities of the
business are not being taken care of, their criticism is well taken. But
often they mean that he is using his strengths and tackling the
activities he is particularly good at, whereas other and equally
important key activities are not being done by him. Then the answer is
not to talk a man who, for instance, is not very good at han- dling
people but excellent at finance into letting the controller do the
finance work, while he himself takes on the management of people. The
answer is to recognize that a top man gifted in the financial area is a
major asset. But then, somebody else better take over the people
responsibility which is a key activity and has to be discharged.</p>
<p>The top man in a small business has to structure his job so as to
have time for two tasks which nobody else can carry. He has to have time
for the key people in the com- pany. And, he has to have time for the
“outside,” that is, for the market, the customer, the technologies. He
has to make sure that he does not become desk-bound.</p>
<p>A major strength of small business is the ability of the man at the
top to know every one of the key people, their ambitions, their
aspirations, their way of thought and action, their strengths and their
limitations, their performance record, and their potential. This
requires time. Above all, it requires unstructured time; that is, time
without a specific agenda, time not spent on a “problem.”</p>
<p>The same goes for the time needed for the outside. A small business
needs a strategy for leadership in a small but defined area. This
requires intimate acquaintance with the outside. If the business aims at
leadership in supplying taxicabs, as the Checker Cab Company does, it
requires time to spend with the licensing authorities of the major
cities whose specifications create the market for the company. It
requires time with the owners of taxi fleets. It perhaps even requires
time with taxicab drivers and passengers.</p>
<p>Most top men in small businesses will protest that they already spend
too much time outside the office. They are forever on the road. They
themselves often handle the big accounts, for instance. They usually
have to negotiate whatever loans they need from the bank. But they need
outside time of a different kind. They need time to keep themselves
informed on their market, on new opportunities, on changes that affect
the business. They need time to be able to answer the question “And what
should our business be?” Again, this does not require many hours. But it
does require systematic, purposeful work that is different in character
from the daily operating routine.</p>
<p>Finally, the small business needs its own control and information
system. Its resources are limited, in both men and money. It has to make
sure that its resources are deployed where they bring in results. Its
ability to get additional resources is equally limited. It therefore
needs to make sure that it will not outrun its financial base. It needs
to know well in advance when and where its financial needs will
increase. The small business can- not afford to find itself in a
liquidity squeeze and with a sudden demand for more money. Even if the
business prospers, it takes time, as a rule, to provide additional
financing.</p>
<p>The small business also needs to know major changes in its
environment. It depends for its success on its preferred position in a
small ecological niche. It therefore needs to know any possibility of
changes in this niche.</p>
<p>The usual accounting information, while needed, is not enough. The
small business needs to know where each of its key people is positioned
and whether he is assigned to “results” or to “problems.” It needs to
know the productivity of its scarce resources—the productivity of
people; the productivity of capital; and the productivity of raw
materials and supplies. It needs to know how its business is distributed
among its customers: does it for instance, depend for its business on
two or three large customers with the rest of its business splintered
among many hundred small ones? And to what extent is it therefore
vulnerable?</p>
<p>Special mention should be given here to the financial and economic
information the small business needs and usually does not have. To be
sure, small businesses today are likely to have the conventional
accounting figures. Few, however, know their cash flow, and even fewer
are in a position to forecast tomorrow’s cash needs. They all know, or
should know, their receivables. But they do not, as a rule, know whether
their customers, their distributors and dealers, are building up their
inventories of the company’s products. They need, therefore, a little
information about the ultimate market for their goods, that is, consumer
purchases from dealers.</p>
<p>Again, a small business needs very few figures. And most of the
figures it needs are easy to obtain, especially as precision is rarely
needed. But the figures the small business needs the most to be managed
are not, as a rule, figures the ordinary accounting model provides. They
are figures which relate the present condition of the company and the
pre- sent deployment of its key resources to anticipated future
developments, both to identify opportunities and to ward off danger.</p>
<p>The small business cannot afford “big management,” if by that is
meant an abundance of staff, of procedures, and of figures. But it needs
first-rate management. It needs to structure the top-management job
precisely because it cannot afford an elaborate top- management
structure.</p>
<p>The Fair-Sized Business</p>
<p>In many respects the fair-sized business is the ideal business. It
should enjoy the advan- tages both of being small and of being big.
People still know each other and can easily get together. Teamwork
organizes itself and should require no special effort. Everybody should
understand what his ,job is and what he is expected to contribute. At
the same time, resources are already adequate to support key activities
and to obtain excellence in those areas where excellence is required and
produces results. And the fair-sized business is big enough to obtain
whatever economies of scale there are. The fair-sized business is the
“middle class” in the Aristotelian sense: the position in business
society which is most secure, most enjoyable, and most productive.</p>
<p>The fair-sized business should also be the easiest business to
manage. In fact, obser- vance of the simple rules that make a small
business manageable should be enough. Yet the fair-sized business also
has its own challenges and its own problems. It needs its own management
rules.</p>
<p>There are actually three different types of fair-sized businesses.
One is exemplified by the automotive division of the A. O. Smith
Company, mentioned above, as it was in the 1950s: a fair-sized business
with a narrow product range, one technology, and one major market. This,
in many ways, is basically a small business but one with a larger key
per- sonnel group than any one man can really know.</p>
<p>The second type is also typified by an example already given: that of
the American Home Products Company of twenty years ago in which a
fair-sized—almost a big— business is composed of a number of autonomous
small businesses, each with its own product lines and its own markets,
but with the same basic economic characteristics. And then there is a
third fair-sized business in which there are separate businesses with
sepa- rate markets which, however, are mutually dependent on each
other.</p>
<p>The best example is a Japanese one. The privately owned electric
railroad—known as the Hankyu Line—which Ichizo Kobayashi built around
1910 to connect Osaka and Kobe was a small business. But then Kobayashi
started a real estate company which developed commuter suburbs along the
railroad’s right of way, both as a business in itself and to generate
traffic for the railroad. Then Hankyu started big restaurants in its two
main ter- minals. The next venture was popular theaters, especially the
famous Girls’ Opera at the terminus of one of the branch lines. A big
department store on top of the Osaka station came next, and finally
hotels. Each of these ventures was an independent, and highly suc-
cessful, business. And each fed off the business generated by the others
and provided cus- tomers for them. All exploited and, at the same time,
increased the company’s basic “franchise.”</p>
<p>This last category is perhaps the one line of business to which the
much-abused term “synergetic” should be applied. Each unit of such a
company is a true business. But the businesses are also interdependent
and comprise together one system, which is a business in its own right
and has to be managed and measured as such.</p>
<p>All three of these types are fair-sized by the yardstick given above.
In each of them, in other words, a small top-management group can and
does know, without consulting or- ganization charts and records, who the
key people in the business are, what their assign- ments are, where they
came from, what their strengths and limitations are, and where they are
likely to go. But otherwise, they have different problems.</p>
<p>The central problem of the fair-sized one-product or one-market
business, the A. O.</p>
<p>Smith type of business, is organization structure. Such a business
is, as a rule, already too large and too complex to be served adequately
by the traditional functional organization. The symptoms of
malorganization to look for in this kind of business are the symptoms of
overextended functionalism: poor communication; functional parochialism;
a long re- sponse time to new stimuli; the tendency to “solve problems”
rather than to make deci- sions; and the tendency to tackle business
challenges in terms of functional specialties rather than in terms of
the direction and performance of the entire business.</p>
<p>Yet such a business cannot be organized in terms of federal
decentralization. There are no autonomous profit and loss centers within
it. This business has to apply simulated decentralization to what are,
in effect, cost centers: e.g., manufacturing. Such a business also often
should use the task force team as a supplementary organizational
principle.</p>
<p>But top-management structure also is a problem in such a business.
For such a busi- ness requires a top-management team. Yet it is usually
organized in such a way that only one man is working full-time on the
top-management job. The fair-sized, one-product or one-market, business
will therefore have to build a top management in which a number of
people are exclusively, or at least primarily, engaged in top-management
work.</p>
<p>This is particularly true for what I call “conscience” work. The
fair-sized business needs to think through the areas in which it
requires excellence. In these areas—and only in them—it should, as a
rule, have a few, a very few men whose job it is to think, to plan, to
advise, and not to operate. Otherwise there is danger that the business
will lose its ex- cellence in key areas and will decline into
middle-aged mediocrity.</p>
<p>The federally organized fair-sized business is the easiest to
organize. It need not, as a rule, use any organization principles other
than the functional principles for the individual businesses and the
principle of federal decentralization for the overall company design.
Teams, to be sure, will be used. But they are not essential within the
individual units ex- cept for innovation.</p>
<p>But top management in such a business has to be based on the team
design, and on a fairly complex one. For such a business needs a number
of top-management teams. And its key people will have to play on several
of these teams at the same time. Such a busi- ness needs a small
corporate top management which does not engage in any work except
top-management work.</p>
<p>But each autonomous business unit also needs a top management. The
top manage- ment of the unit should be small. The man who heads each
unit is “top management” for it. But he needs to think through the key
activities of the unit and to lodge them within his own group. But at
the same time, the top-management team of his unit also includes the top
management of the company. At American Home Products, for example, each
of the four members of corporate top management was, at the same time, a
member of the top- management team of one or more of the operating
businesses.</p>
<p>For the areas which are “corporate,” such as what the business is and
what it should be; what new businesses to enter and what old ones to go
out of; the supply and allocation of capital; and the placement of key
people, corporate top management is the top- management team. It will,
of course, consult with the heads of the individual units. But the
decision has to be made in contemplation of the entire business.</p>
<p>For his individual unit, however, it is the general manager of the
unit rather than the chief executive officer of the corporation who is
the leader and who should be expected to take full business
responsibility for his unit. The corporate top-management group is, in
effect, “support” to the heads of the individual businesses.</p>
<p>“We sometimes replace the president of one of our divisions,” one of
the top men at American Home Products explained in the early fifties.
“But we never overrule him. He is expected to consult us; to ask for our
opinions; and to keep us informed. But when it comes to a decision with
respect to his own business, he makes it. If he is not willing to do
this and wants us to make the decisions for him, we have no choice but
to replace him, no matter how effective he may be in day-to-day
operations. Otherwise we cannot do our top-management job.”</p>
<p>This means that the people who run the individual units have to take
the responsibility for keeping corporate top management informed
regarding their own business. Corporate top management is their team—and
they owe to it the information and education which a team leader always
owes to his team members.</p>
<p>The “synergetic” fair-sized business, finally, has to be organized on
two axes. It is a unified business, a system, and as such requires
strong, unified top management, and es- pecially unified planning. But
its individual units are both autonomous and interdepend-</p>
<p>ent.</p>
<p>Corporate top management must see—and manage—the company as one unit.
Yet each unit is a business of its own. Each has to be able to stand on
its own feet; no business in such a synergetic system can ever be
allowed to be merely a cost center, justified by its contribution to its
sister businesses rather than by its own results. Each has to be a
leader in its field, have clear business objectives, understand its key
activities, and be organized to perform them. But each business also
depends on the other. The head of each unit, therefore, has to know what
goes on in all others, and has to be concerned with them.</p>
<p>There are therefore, three kinds of top-management teams in the
synergetic fair-sized business—and they better make sure that they play
according to the rules that govern each of these three different teams.
There is, first, of course, a top-management team for the entire
group—very similar to the top-management team required by the business
based on true federal decentralization. Then, there has to be a
top-management team for each unit, again similar to what each American
Home Products division required several decades ago.</p>
<p>But the heads of each division are also of necessity, together with
corporate top man- agement, a distinct top-management team. They have to
work out the relationships among the different ventures. They have to
think through how each of these ventures affects the others. They have
to think through in what form they have to make their contribution to
each other. They have, in other words, to look upon themselves as being
responsible both for their own unit and for the health and performance
of all the others.</p>
<p>All three types of fair-sized businesses are prone to the same
degenerative disease: flabbiness. In a fair-sized business, great care
is required to make sure that fat is not mis- taken for muscle and
business volume for business performance.</p>
<p>The fair-sized business is particularly susceptible to marginal
ventures. A well- managed fair-sized business is a business of high
competence within its area. It usually does with great ease, indeed
without apparent effort, what many other businesses find hard to do and
often cannot do at all. It is therefore likely to have great
self-confidence. At the same time, it is a business that, precisely
because of its competence, does not offer great excitement. “Crises” are
comparatively rare. Everybody knows what he is expected to do and does
it. And there is often, therefore, in the fair-sized business a strong
desire for doing new and “exciting” things; a strong push for
adventure.</p>
<p>And it seems so easy then to tackle things to which one’s competence,
one’s knowl- edge, one’s expertise, would be applicable. Indeed the
management people in a well-run fair-sized business always wonder why
other businesses, in what to them seem closely related areas, are not
doing better. They always think that if they only went into this new
product line, or that new market, they could easily establish leadership
there.</p>
<p>Yet few things are harder to predict than the extent to which
knowledge and expertise in one area can be transferred to another.</p>
<p>The secret of success for a fair-sized business is concentration of
effort. Sony in Japan has refused to go beyond its specific ecological
niche and to engage in ventures beyond it. At the same time, it clearly
has a policy of doing nothing marginal. Each product line, each market,
apparently has to stand on its own feet and has to meet high performance
standards of its own. This policy of concentration made Sony, within
fifteen years, into one of the world’s best known fair-sized companies.
A few years later, in the early 1970s, Sony then grew from being
fair-sized to being a genuinely big business.</p>
<p>In those areas in which excellence is required to obtain objectives,
a fair-sized busi- ness better behave as if it were a big business.
These areas need strength. They need re- sources. They need high demands
and insistence on performance. But in all other areas, only the
minimum—or less—should ever be done. A fair-sized business is a business
which has leadership in a fairly narrow but already visible and
important area. To main- tain this leadership position is the secret of
success in a fair-sized business. To dilute it is to court failure.</p>
<p>The fair-sized business is, perhaps, best suited of all business
sizes for successful in- novation. But the innovative efforts should
strengthen the basic unity of the business rather than dilute it. They
should capitalize on the strengths of the business. Particularly in</p>
<p>the fair-sized business that is a configuration of autonomous small
businesses—e.g., the American Home Products of the early
1950s—innovation should be directed toward de- veloping new small
businesses with high growth potential but with the same basic charac-
teristics; that is, businesses in which rhe skill and knowledge of the
fair-sized business can have full play. For a fair-sized business is
strong precisely because it has excellence in a clearly defined area or
a clearly defined market.</p>
<p>In a synergetic fair-sized business, innovation should aim at
exploiting the “franchise”</p>
<p>of the company, its acceptance by a segment of the market, or its
special knowledge in one area.</p>
<p>A fair-sized business requires, in sum, great managerial
self-discipline. It requires the willingness to support, with full
resources, the efforts and areas on which the success of the business
has been built. It requires self-restraint and almost austerity in all
other areas. The well-managed fair-sized business is a business that
knows what its business is and what it should be, and that purposefully
and systematically concentrates its resources— and especially its
resources of performing key people—toward the attainment of its basic
mission.</p>
<p>The Big Business</p>
<p>The small and the fair-sized business belong essentially in the same
category. The group on the performance of which the success of the
business depends is still small enough and cohesive enough to know each
other personally and to be in continuing personal contact with each
other. The aim of management in these businesses is to make these
direct, close, intimate personal relationships fully effective through
direction, system, and structure.</p>
<p>The definition of a big business is that the top-management group, no
matter how large, no longer knows personally every key performer, no
longer works with each of them directly, no longer constitutes a
self-disciplining team. The big business has to be impersonal.</p>
<p>Once the business has reached the point at which the top-management
group can no longer know the key people personally and directly, it has,
in effect, reached the final stage in size. From there on, additional
managerial needs and demands are caused by in- creasing complexity
rather than by increasing size.</p>
<p>A big business has to organize properly the formal, the objective
structure. Relation- ships, information about people, and mobilization
of individual energies have to be built into a structure which, of
necessity, has to be impersonal, based on policies, on objec- tives, on
abstract definitions of jobs and of contributions, and on the routines
of proce- dures. The big business requires clarity.</p>
<p>People in the big business no longer easily know each other. They no
longer know from daily experience what the other man’s job is and how he
goes about performing it. They no longer have immediate access to final
results and therefore cannot easily direct their own work and efforts
toward contribution and performance. They need to know the objectives of
the business and its priorities; its strategies and its goals; their own
position within the structure and their relationship to others.
Otherwise a big business degenerates into bureaucracy where observing
the proprieties becomes more important than results, and procedure is
mistaken for productivity.</p>
<p>The big business, almost by definition, needs to employ a number of
organization structures. It is far too big to be organized on the
functional principle. Wherever possible, therefore, it needs to employ
federal decentralization. And where this is not available to it, e.g.,
in a process industry or a commercial bank, it needs to experiment wth
simulated decentralization. But it also needs teams. Indeed it is in the
big business where the func- tion becomes the man’s “home” rather than
his “place of work,” and where the profes- sional is most likely to make
his greatest contribution as a member of one or several teams.</p>
<p>This, however, also requires clear thinking about the manager’s job.
It requires that the job be defined in terms of contribution and
assignment, but also in terms of its posi-</p>
<p>tion in decision strategy, in the flow of information, and in terms
of relationships. And in the big business, both the development of
management and the development of managers become crucial.</p>
<p>A big business requires, practically without exception, a number of
top management teams. It requires, therefore, that top-management
activities become clearly identified, clearly defined, and firmly
assigned. And in a big business the key activities will always include a
number of conscience areas.</p>
<p>The big business also needs the “executive secretariat” or the
“business research group” discussed in Chapter 51, to make its top
management effective. Otherwise the top- management teams will lose
cohesion. Or else they will spend far too much of their time on
“coordinating,” far too much time on jurisdictional conflicts and on
clearing up misun- derstandings. Top management in the big business is
too complex a function not to have its own organ of information,
stimulation, thinking, and communications.</p>
<p>Big business is therefore, of necessity, highly structured, complex,
formal—and not very fast.</p>
<p>This implies that big business should not, as a rule, engage in
small-business ventures.</p>
<p>At least it should not engage in any venture which, if reasonably
successful, will not de- velop into a fair-sized business. Small
businesses cannot afford the overhead of a big business, its formal
management structure, its job descriptions and administration, its
staffs, or its formal planning and budgetary. Big business cannot do
without these tools.</p>
<p>Big business management also lacks the “feel” for small business. It
is unlikely to un- derstand it and it will therefore make the wrong
decisions. Yet, to innovate, big business needs to start small ventures;
for the new always starts small. Big business therefore needs to be able
to set up and tolerate the innovative team (see Chapter 61, “The
Innovative Organization”) as both part of, and outside of, its structure
at one and the same time. But big business also needs systematic
attempts to introduce flexibility and even “disorder” into what
otherwise easily becomes a straitjacket of rules and procedures.</p>
<p>Top management, in particular, needs to work on direct face-to-face
relationships with people throughout the organization and especially
with the younger professional contribu- tors. It needs to organize
itself to sit down with people throughout the organization, to listen to
them, to help them focus their vision on the objectives and
opportunities of the business rather than on their own functional or
technical work, and above all, to get to know them.</p>
<p>But the personal relationships which give flexibility to the big
business and establish the habit of cooperation between what otherwise
might well become rigid bureaucrats cannot be left to top management
alone—though they will not develop unless top man- agement works at
them. Management development within big business has as one of its major
duties the creation of personal bonds and relationships throughout the
organization.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is for managers and professionals to grow up
together and to get to know each other in their work. When they reach
positions of responsibility, they should know enough people in all areas
of the company to be able to go directly to the “right” man if something
needs to be done in a hurry and “outside of channels.” Teams in a big
business are therefore a good deal more than organizational designs for
specific tasks, such as innovation or special studies. In the big
business the team in which people from various areas and from various
kinds of work join together in a common effort and as colleagues is
“management development.” It is building the capacity for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Danger of Becoming Inbred</p>
<p>A big business needs to guard against the danger of becoming insular
and inbred. Most of its managers and professionals are not, in their
daily work, in direct contact with the out- side world. They work
inside. It is in the big business where the law of surface and mass
creates the need for special organs but also dictates that these special
organs will further insulate an already insulated inside.</p>
<p>The members of the top-management teams in the big business,
therefore, have a par- ticular responsibility for becoming the “sensing”
organ for the outside, the eyes and ears of the organization. If they
remove themselves from market and customer and come to rely on reports
and inside information, they will soon lose their ability to sense and
antici- pate changes in the market and to perceive, let alone to
appreciate, the unexpected.</p>
<p>If they insulate themselves from knowledge other than that peculiar
to the industry or to the company, they will soon lose their capacity
for technological or social understand- ing and insight. If they confine
their working contacts to people inside the organization, or to people
from other businesses who do exactly the same work—as most
top-management people are prone to do—they will soon become unable to
understand how ordinary human beings behave. They will soon fall into
the old fallacy of saying, “There is a right way and a wrong way and our
way.” They need to organize themselves for productive working time
outside of their own business, and indeed outside their own
industry.</p>
<p>But the new, the different, the outside view also has to be injected
into the organiza- tion itself. The big business which relies
exclusively on promotion from within breeds complacency, rigidity, and
blind adherence to custom. The big business needs a system- atic policy
for bringing in outsiders to fill positions of substantial
responsibility.</p>
<p>It is an admission of bankruptcy for a big business to have to go on
the outside to re- cruit into top management. It is also a desperate
gamble. There is no certainty, indeed, not even high probability, that
the newcomer will “take.” But if he is not the right man, it is
difficult and indeed risky—and at the least most painful—to get rid of
him again. At the same time, the outsider who comes into a junior
position has no power and little chance of being heard. And by the time
he reaches a position of influence and responsibility, he has of course,
become an insider.</p>
<p>Upper-middle management positions are the positions into which people
from the out- side should be brought with fair regularity. It might be
company policy to fill a small pro- portion of such positions with
people who have not come up in business but have made their careers in
other institutions.</p>
<p>New work should, preferably, be filled from the inside unless it
requires such special talents or such special technical and professional
background as to make going on the outside absolutely necessary. New
work, by definition, is difficult and certain to run into trouble. There
is therefore a premium on staffing it with people whose capacity to per-
form is proven and known—and that one only knows of the insider. New
work always requires acceptance on faith on the part of the
organization. For it takes always a good long time before any new work
produces results. In the beginning therefore all new work will be
received with skepticism within the organization, will tend to be
considered a “fad,” will be controversial. And then the insider whose
capacity to perform has been tested will be accepted because he is known
and trusted.</p>
<p>The outsider should, as a rule, be brought into work that is known
and, by and large, already done. But he should be brought in with the
express understanding that it is his job to take a critical look at the
way the work is being performed and to suggest new and dif- ferent ways
of doing it. He should be brought in with the understanding that he is
to ask questions, suggest changes, and be altogether a “disorganizer.”
This is an uncomfortable role. It is also one that an organization
tolerates only if it is being done on a fairly regular basis and is not
a “sensation” every time.</p>
<p>Top management needs to know what size its top-management group
actually is and needs to adopt a strategy and build a structure
appropriate to the size of the business. For size is not, as most
managements seem to believe, intuitively obvious. On the contrary, a
great many businesses do not know what size they are and know even less
what the right strategies and the right structures are for their size.
There are countless small businesses which load themselves down with
expensive staffs in areas which have little to do with the performance
and results of the business. There are countless fair-sized businesses
which fritter away their strengths on marginal activities, marginal
products, and marginal mar- kets. There are countless big businesses
whose top managements suffer from the delusion that they are really “one
small happy family.” There are indeed many big businesses in</p>
<p>which top management is the victim and prisoner of its own inanities,
such as “I still know every man in the plant by his first name,” or, “My
door is always open.” There are countless big businesses which, as a
result, are essentially unmanaged. But there are also a great many big
businesses which believe that formal structure and rules are all that is
needed and which, as a result of neglecting direct human relationships
