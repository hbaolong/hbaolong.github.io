<p>S</p>
<p>HOEMAKER, STICK TO YOUR LAST! The old cliché is still sound advice.
The less diverse a business, the more manageable it is. Simplicity makes
for clarity. Peo- ple can understand their own job and see its
relationship to results and to the perform- ance of the whole. Efforts
will tend to be concentrated. Expectations can be defined, and results
can easily be appraised and measured.</p>
<p>The less complex a business is, the fewer things can go wrong. And
the more complex a business is, the more difficult it is to figure out
what went wrong and to take the right remedial action. Complexity
creates problems of communications. The more complex a business, the
more layers of management, the more special “coordinators,” the more
forms and procedures, the more meetings, and the more delays in making
decisions.</p>
<p>Yet for a long time the belief has been held widely that the business
that “diversifies”</p>
<p>into many areas is likely to do better than the business that
concentrates on one area. The belief is sheer myth and is contradicted
by all evidence.</p>
<p>Never was the belief in diversification as a panacea more widely held
than in the 1950s and 1960s. Yet the success stories of these years were
not the businesses that diver- sified, let alone the “conglomerates.”
They were IBM and Xerox in the U.S., Sony, Honda, and Toyota in Japan,
Fiat and Volkswagen, Pilkington Glass in England, and the Swiss
pharmaceutical companies—all businesses with one central product or
product line, one central market, one central technology. The success
story of Swedish manufacturing industry was Atlas Copco, a company that
has one main business: drilling hard rock. Con- centration rather than
diversification also characterizes the outstanding business successes
outside of manufacturing. Here the success stories are Sears, Roebuck in
the U.S., Marks andandandand Spencer in Great Britain, Donaldson, Lufkin
andandandand Jenrette, specializing in the institutional investor among
the New York Stock Exchange firms, and the Enskilda Bank in Stock- holm,
concentrating on the development of a few major Swedish industries.
Sotheby, the London-based art auctioneer, and such publishing houses as
Bertelsmann in Germany and Prentice-Hall in the United States, all major
“growth” companies, are all businesses with</p>
<p>one clear mission and one focus, and with excellence in one area, one
market, and essen- tially one product line.</p>
<p>Indeed the experience of the fifties and sixties indicates that
complexity is competitive disadvantage. Complex businesses, despite
their size and large resources, have again and again shown themselves
exceedingly vulnerable to competition by a small but highly con-
centrated single-market or single-technology business.</p>
<p>Among the “long-pull” performers the “stars” are also the highly
concentrated, single- market or single-technology businesses, e.g.,
Eastman Kodak, GM, and the Swiss phar- maceutical companies.</p>
<p>The outstanding public-service institutions similarly tend to be
single-mission institu- tions rather than diversified. In the United
States in the last thirty or forty years the exam- ples of
public-service achievement are the Port of New York Authority, the
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), Rural Electrification, or the Social
Security Administration in its earlier and relatively uncluttered days.
Each of these agencies tried to do one thing at a time. But the
“diversification craze” hit public-service agencies as hard in the
fifties and sixties as it hit businesses. It led to the emergence of the
“multiversity,” willing, indeed eager, to tackle any job anyone was
willing to give a professor a contract for; to the “con- glomerate
agencies” of the War on Poverty tackling simultaneously all social ills
known to mankind; or to the agencies of the Environmental Crusade,
concerned with every prob- lem of environment, pollution, and
technology. These newer agencies dispose of vastly bigger budgets. They
engage in scintillating intellectual debates—whereas the earlier ones
tended to be rather dull and concerned with such boring matters as
getting things done. But the new diversified or conglomerate
public-service institutions have not accomplished much.</p>
<p>The same thing applies to service staffs within businesses. The
performers are single- purpose staffs, trying to do one thing, and one
thing only. Few of the highly diversified research labs which try to
“cover all the basic sciences” have research results; those seem to
emerge mostly from labs that focus on one area, whether antibiotics or
power metal- lurgy.</p>
<p>Engineers speak half-jokingly of Murphy’s Law: “If anything can go
wrong, it will.”</p>
<p>But complexity stands under a second law as well. Let me call it
Drucker’s Law: “If one thing goes wrong, everything else will, and at
the same time.” And if anything goes wrong, then there is a premium on
knowing one’s business, on understanding it, on being close to it.
Diversity and complexity, however, mean that one cannot know one’s busi-
nesses, cannot understand them, cannot be close to them.</p>
<p>There is a point or complexity beyond which a business is no longer
manageable.</p>
<p>When top management has to depend totally on abstractions, such as
formal reports, fig- ures, and quantitative data, rather than be able to
see, know, and understand the business, its reality, its people, its
environment, its customers, its technology, then a business has become
too complex to be manageable. A business is manageable only if top
management is capable of testing against concrete reality the
measurements and information it receives, that is, its abstract figures,
data, and reports.</p>
<p>The information system can be as well designed as possible, as
complete as possible, and as much in “real time” as possible. Yet it
only answers questions which top manage- ment has already asked. It can
only report what had already had impact—that is, what is already
yesterday. For one can only codify the past. And every report is
codification.</p>
<p>The new developments that really matter are always by definition
outside any possible reporting system. By the time they show up in the
figures, it is very late—and may well be too late. Unless one
understands what is truly relevant, unless one has the ability to hold
the actual reality against one’s expectations, one will be overtaken by
events. One will become aware of problems only when they have become
“trouble.” One will see opportu- nities only when they have already been
missed.</p>
<p>Litton Industries in the United States was the pioneer of all the
post-World War II conglomerates. It was built and led by exceedingly
able men with wide industrial experi- ence, who had earlier built Hughes
Aircraft into leadership in military electronics. Litton</p>
<p>was the first of the conglomerates to preach the gospel of management
by “controls,” that is, by reports, data, and organized information. Yet
Litton was the first of the conglomer- ates to stub its toes, and to
prove the vulnerability of complexity and diversification. By the time
the Litton top management found out that its office equipment business
was in serious trouble, it was very late.</p>
<p>The Fallacy of “Asset Management”</p>
<p>The greatest fallacy of them all, but also the one that was most
popular in the heady days of the merger and acquisition boom of the
1960s, is the fallacy of “asset management.” There is such a business.
But it is strictly a financial one—it is, for instance, how Donaldson,
Lufkin, andandandand Jenrette have come to define their financial
business, which em- braces securities research, securities advice,
portfolio management, and mutual fund man- agement. There is also an
asset management function within each business. Every busi- ness needs
to make sure that assets are being managed and are being employed where
the results are. But asset management as it relates to non-financial
businesses is a function and not the definition of the business.</p>
<p>The asset managers who acquired operating businesses performed a
useful function when they closed down or sold off parts that were tying
down large chunks of assets with- out producing returns. But once they
had done this, they did not know what to do. They did not know how to
manage a business—and the boom of asset management ended in predictable
failure.</p>
<p>“Investor” vs. “Asset Manager”</p>
<p>There is indeed a way to do what the asset managers promised to do,
but it is long-term industrial investment rather than sleight-of-hand
asset management.</p>
<p>One example is the group built in England by Lord Cowdray around his
family firm of</p>
<p>S. Pearson andandandand Son. The Cowdray group holds interests in the
original business of the firm, construction. It controls Lazards, one of
London’s leading merchant banks. It controls newspapers and magazines,
such as the London Economist. Yet each of these businesses is managed
separately, by its own management team. Each has its own mission, its
own objectives, its own strategy—and its own results. Lord Cowdray and
his associates sit on the board of directors. They make sure that the
board does its own task; that is, that it reviews the basic plans and
strategies of each company and puts in a top-management team that is
doing its job and performs. But they do not “manage” the businesses.
Above all, they do not pretend that they own or manage one conglomerate
company. They are investors. Cowdray, for instance, identifies himself
in Who’s Who as an “investment company executive.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Friedrich Flick in Germany (died 1972) was an “investor,”
controlling Mer- cedes-Benz, Feldmuehle, a major paper and chemical
company, a large manufacturer of specialty machinery, and a steel
company. While Flick’s influence on these companies was great, he did
not manage them. He was a major outside investor and hard-working board
member.</p>
<p>The Mellons in Pittsburgh, similarly, have been large and influential
long-term inves- tors in a number of companies ranging from Gulf Oil to
the Aluminum Company of America, but never “managers.” And both the
Mellons and the “Mellon companies” have greatly benefited from the
relationship.</p>
<p>The investment company which looks for the right business to invest
in, takes a sub- stantial position in it, and then provides counsel and
effective hard-working board mem- bers is indeed a viable business of
its own. But it is a financial business.</p>
<p>Just as fallacious as the belief in asset management is the belief in
a “superman” who can do what other people cannot do, and who therefore
can somehow keep manageable a business that is in dozens—or, as in one
case, in several hundred—different fields, from insurance to
electronics—from rental cars to convenience foods—from computers to ho-
tels. Supermen may actually exist in the executive suite—though the
evidence is hardly</p>
<p>convincing. But despite everything their press agents say, even
supermen are mortal. And one cannot replace them once they are gone.
What only supermen can do is always un- sound; it cannot be
perpetuated.</p>
<p>Nothing succeeds like concentration on the right business. And if the
company is not in the right business, diversification will no more make
it a “growth company,” than a man with a broken hip will be restored to
health, by being taken on a twenty-mile forced march with an
eighty-pound pack on his shoulders.</p>
<p>Why Diversification?</p>
<p>All this should be fairly obvious. What, then, explains the
persistent allure of this manage- rial Lorelei, the quest for diversity
and complexity, and the worship of diversification?</p>
<p>The record provides a clue. For while the best-performing group of
businesses is al- ways found to comprise highly concentrated,
single-market, or single-technology compa- nies, the worst-performing
group also always includes a goodly number of such highly concentrated,
single-market, or single-technology companies. The railroads—since the
end of World War II if not since the end of World War I—belong here.</p>
<p>So do the “traditional materials” businesses—steel in the U.S. and
Western Europe, coal everywhere, copper and aluminum, and so on.*</p>
<p>There are internal as well as external reasons and pressures for
diversification. Man- agement needs to understand them, to be able to
manage them—and to manage such di- versification as might be needed in,
and indeed desirable for, a business.</p>
<p>First, the internal pressures:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One major pressure for diversification is psychological. People get
tired of doing the same things over and over again. They want to do
something different. Otherwise work becomes a bore.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a pharmaceutical business one hears again and again, “Our
customers, the physi- cians, are getting tired of the same drug. They
have been using it now for three years. They need something different.”
Judging by the prescriptions the physicians write for the drug, there is
no loss of interest. It is the salesmen who are getting tired of
repeating the same story again and again every time they call on a
physician. It is the salesmen who want “something different.”</p>
<p>This is not altogether frivolous. Indeed it is highly desirable that
any company remain flexible and practice doing something new and
different. Otherwise its capacity for change may atrophy. And when the
need for change arises, as it always does sooner or later, the company
will be unable to make even small and minor changes.</p>
<p>This is shown by the contrast between the two largest European
automobile compa- nies of the post-World War II period, Volkswagen and
Fiat. Volkswagen scored phe- nomenally with its “Beetle” for fifteen
years from 1950, when the company got going, until the late sixties:
Volkswagen knew, of course, of the ultimate collapse of Ford’s ear- lier
“universal car” of the World War I period, the Model T. Yet it kept the
“Beetle” un- changed until it showed fairly advanced symptoms of old age
in the late sixties. Then Volkswagen poured enormous amounts of money
into developing a multitude of new models. But not one of them has so
far proven successful in the market.</p>
<p>Fiat too had the “universal car” for the early stages of
automobilization in its famous Model 500, the Topolino. But Fiat, from
the beginning of the European automobile boom, systematically built up a
full product range from the low-price “universal car,” the almost
unchanged successor to the Topolino, to cars that extend well into the
medium-price range. For the ten or fifteen years during which the
“Beetle” enjoyed its phenomenal suc-</p>
<p>*A statistical study that relates diversification strategy to
business performance will be published shortly after the publication of
this book. Entitled Organizational Strategy: Analysis, Commitment,
Implementation (Irwin, 1975) and authored by Professor William Guth of
the Graduate Business School of New York University, it reports the
results of many years of work on diversification strategies and their
results. Guth’s analysis fully bears out the conclusions reached
independently by me and presented in this and the two subsequent
chapters. Guth’s analysis is to my knowledge, the first fully documented
study of this important subject.</p>
<p>cess, Fiat seemed in danger of being overtaken by Volkswagen. But
when the “Beetle” began to falter, Fiat forged ahead. All along it had
maintained its capacity to innovate and at the same time had given its
customers the choice of upgrading themselves to a bigger and better car
as their incomes and their appetites increased.</p>
<p>The advantages of concentration always carry with them the danger of
overspecializa- tion. Every product, every process, every technology,
every market eventually become old. The sales volume may still be there,
may indeed still go up. But the profitability dis-</p>
<p>appears. Then yesterday’s specialist is in danger of becoming
extinct.</p>
<p>Like any habit, the habit of doing the new and different has to be
kept alive by prac- tice. Otherwise the capacity for doing the different
will not be developed or—as in the case of the once highly innovative
textile industry—it will wither away. Diversification is not only a
psychological necessity. To keep one’s ability to diversify is an
economic sur-</p>
<p>vival need.</p>
<p>But care has to be taken lest this kind of diversification degenerate
into splintering.</p>
<p>The need to give the pharmaceutical company salesman something new to
talk about may easily degenerate into meaningless product proliferation
which then not only confuses the customer but annoys him. The product
proliferation in which a good many of the Ameri- can pharmaceutical
companies indulged for the sake of “doing something new” explains, in
large measure, why the U.S. medical fraternity has come to be so highly
critical of the drug companies.</p>
<p>The right rule was developed many, many years ago by the musician. An
accom- plished and well-established concert pianist will, as a matter of
course, add one new major piece to his repertoire each year. Every few
years he will pick for his new piece some- thing quite different from
the repertoire through which he has made his name. This forces him to
learn again, to hear new things in old and familiar pieces, and to
become a better pianist altogether. At the same time, concert pianists
have long known that they slough off an old piece as they add on one new
major one. The total size of the repertoire remains the same. There are
only so many pieces of music even the greatest pianist can play with
excellence.</p>
<p>How to apply this to a business has been demonstrated by the one
American pharma- ceutical company that has, for many years, followed a
systematic plan for research and for the introduction of drugs, Merck
andandandand Co.</p>
<p>Merck is as conscious as any other pharmaceutical company of the need
of salesmen to have “something new.” But it will not spend much time or
effort on the modification of existing products. It focuses its energies
on producing each year a small number of genu- inely new and different
drugs which represent a major improvement in the treatment of disease.
As a result, its salesmen really have something new to talk about. But
as a result also there is genuine diversification rather than mere
product proliferation. And Merck also then quietly withdraws effort and
support from older drugs which no longer have leadership. This strategy,
adopted in the late 1940s, has made Merck, which originally</p>
<p>was an insignificant and almost marginal distributor of patent
medicines, into the largest and most successful of American drug
manufacturers, and also into a most innovative one.</p>
<p>Backward and Forward Integration</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Another factor pressing for diversification has already been
discussed in a preceding chapter: being the wrong size. Diversification,
that is, extension of the business into new areas which balance the
vulnerabilities and weaknesses of one’s own wrong size, is not the only
remedy. But it is one of the remedies. And where it is appropriate, it
is the right remedy. Diversification in this situation becomes the best
strategy for a business.</li>
</ol>
<p>Closely related to the problem of the business that is the wrong size
is the need to in- tegrate either “backward” into earlier stages of the
economic chain, e.g., manufacturing for a distributor or mining for a
manufacturer; or integration “forward,” that is, toward the
marketplace.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck with 0 billion in sales is by far the largest American
retailer. But it is also one of the largest American manufacturers. More
than half of what Sears sells is made by manufacturers in which Sears
has an ownership stake, and sometimes even full ownership. This
“backward integration” of Sears is usually explained as a result of
Sears’s desire to “control” its sources of supply. But the more probable
answer might be that Sears found in the twenties and early thirties when
it first emerged as a retail giant, that suppliers would not commit
themselves to Sears unless assured of the permanence of the
relationship. For most Sears suppliers, and certainly for the successful
ones, Sears becomes rapidly their major customer, and their main, if not
eventually their sole, channel to the market. A supplier would be very
foolish if he did not insist on more assurance of a permanent
relationship than even a long-term contract provides. Without such
evidence of Sears’s commitment, he would, for instance, find it
difficult to obtain capital or credit from the outside. An intelligent
supplier would have balked at being tied to Sears unless Sears were also
tied to him. The major impetus to Sears’s backward integration was
surely that without it Sears was the “wrong size.”</p>
<p>The same largely applies to integration backward into raw materials.
The traditional explanation for backward integration is the fear of a
loss of supply. A manufacturer of petroleum products, of paper, or of
aluminum, integrates backward because he sees the danger of a shortage
in his basic material, i.e., crude oil, timber, or bauxite. But this ex-
planation is suspect. For such fears of scarcity have so far always been
disproved.</p>
<p>Successful backward integration creates a more profitable
business.</p>
<p>The oil refinery which has a substantial distribution system in the
form of gas stations, but which lacks crude oil reserves, may decide to
integrate backward and to acquire sup- plies of crude oil, because
otherwise it is the wrong size to be profitable. The profitable link in
the economic chain that leads from the oil well to the automobile’s gas
tank may be crude oil production. Or it may turn out that only the
combination of oil production and oil distribution is truly profitable;
each alone is a fragment rather than a business.</p>
<p>This, for instance, seems to have been the thinking that led one of
the large American marketers of petroleum products, Atlantic Refining,
into integration backward through merger with a crude oil producer who
in turn lacked refining and marketing capacity, the Richfield Oil
Company. Forward integration should be based on the same thinking. Cour-
taulds (see the preceding chapter), which solved its problem of being
the wrong size by forward integration into textile production, is a good
example.</p>
<p>Only integration—backward or forward—that remedies a problem of the
wrong size works out, as a rule. Integration is complexity. Even though
a company that integrates forward or backward stays in the same
industry, it moves into areas in which it has little or no previous
experience. It diversifies its activities. It requires new skills. It
assumes new risks. This is justified if it remedies gross disparity
between the cost and rewards of certain phases of the economic process
of which the company is a part. Decisions con- cerning integration
should therefore always start out with an understanding of cost struc-
ture and revenue streams for the entire economic process. That
combination of stages in the economic process which will give over the
long term the most favorable ratio between cost and revenues, and
between opportunities and risks, is the best integration balance for a
business.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Another internal pressure for diversification is the
understandable—and indeed un- derstandable—desire to convert an internal
cost center into a revenue producer.</li>
</ol>
<p>J. Lyons andandandand Company started out as caterers to an
exhibition held in London in the 1890s. The firm then branched out
rapidly into building popular chain-restaurants serving decent food at
low prices. By 1914, its “tea shops” had become a London landmark. It
then diversified further, still within the same market, into building
large restaurants, the famous Corner Houses; into building
popular-priced hotels; and into manufacturing food- stuffs first for its
own restaurants and hotels and then increasingly for the British con-
sumer. It became a major manufacturer of baked goods; of tea, and of ice
cream. In order to support these activities, Lyons very early had to
build its own laundry—laundry service for tea shops, restaurants, and
hotels could not be obtained on the outside in the quality</p>
<p>and, above all, in the quantity needed. And it had to develop its own
trucking fleet. For many years now these two ancillary businesses have
been run as profit-making businesses of their own, offering laundry and
trucking services to a wide variety of commercial aud industrial
customers.</p>
<p>But even a profitable business that is developed out of a cost center
should be kept only if it fits in. It should be kept only if it is
compatible with one’s own mission, and one’s own strategy, and if it
serves one’s own market or exploits one’s own technology. Otherwise it
leads to a diffusion of efforts.</p>
<p>Indeed it might be advisable to separate such a business developed
out of a cost center and to set it up independently, even though it does
fit into the overall frame. One example of this is offered by Heineken,
the leading Dutch brewery, which for reasons that closely paralleled
those underlying the Lyons diversification, went into financing and then
own- ing restaurants and cafés, then into investments in hotels and also
into trucking. Heineken, however, has put these outside interests, which
are not directly a part of the business of making and selling beverages,
into a separate investment company which Heineken owns but which
Heineken does not manage.</p>
<p>External Pressures</p>
<p>More important and more pervasive are a number of external pressures
toward diversity.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is first the pressure of an economy which is so small and
confined that the in- dividual business cannot grow beyond small size.
At the same time, the economy is so small that an individual management
can know it in all its facets and dimensions. At that stage in the
development of an economy, technology is likely to be available from the
outside; the market is still too small to appear promising to major
companies elsewhere. Capital at this stage of development is likely also
to have to come from the outside. And the foreign investor tends to
prefer working with people who have already established themselves in
the market and have proven their entrepreneurial and managerial compe-
tence. Under these circumstances business growth will tend to become
growth through diversification.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is indeed a major stage in economic development.</p>
<p>Belgium, which in the early nineteenth century was the most highly
industrialized of all countries on the European continent, became the
prototype. The pattern then estab- lished has persisted until now: one
entrepreneurial and managerial group diversifies into a substantial
number of different industries, all producing for the same limited
national market. This same pattern was then repeated half a century
later in the industrialization of Japan. Three or four Zaibatsu groups
were the managerial foci. Their ability to obtain technology from abroad
enabled them to go into a large number of different industries, each of
them for a long time quite small and producing for what, until well into
this cen- tury, was a limited home market. In Brazil the same pattern
emerged when industrializa- tion started after World War I. The
Mattarazzos, for instance, began around World War I with a noodle
factory—perhaps the first industrial business in Brazil that was purely
do- mestic rather than a branch of a foreign company. Thirty years
later, by the early 1950s, the Mattarazzos controlled a vast industrial
empire composed of fairly small companies in a variety of businesses.
India still exhibits very much the same pattern with the two busi- ness
empires of Tata and Birla, both engaged in a large number of quite
different busi- nesses. The same pattern of the one management group
engaged in a large number of businesses within a small market
characterizes industry in such countries as Peru and Venezuela
today.</p>
<p>But the same pattern also ruled California until World War II even
though politically California had of course long been part of a
continental economy, that of the United States. Yet until World War II,
geography and distance provided a measure of isolation which made
California in many ways a protected and at the same time a small
market.</p>
<p>In many cases of economic development the diversified company in the
small econ- omy may indeed be the best pattern. It is, however, not an
“inevitable stage” in develop-</p>
<p>ment. Neither Switzerland nor Holland—both at that stage poorer and
less populous than Belgium—followed it. Both overcame the limitations of
their home market by early ex- pansion abroad.</p>
<p>And diversification within the confined economy should always be
considered a tran- sitory place.</p>
<p>Many of the Californian businesses that were started, mostly after
World War I, to supply a limited West Coast market—and which were often
based on technology bought or licensed from the big companies of the
East and Middle West—have by now grown into national businesses, some of
them (e.g., Avery Products, a leader in adhesive labels and other paper
products) into very sizable businesses. Others went “national” by
merging with companies from the East. The other “regionals” have either
disappeared or shrunk into insignificance.</p>
<p>For diversification within the small and confined economy becomes the
wrong pattern when the market grows. Japan had outgrown the pattern even
before the American Occu- pation dissolved the Zaibatsu. Brazil has
outgrown it since the end of World War II. The dominant Brazilian
businesses of today are highly concentrated, e.g., Volkswagen do Brazil
or Sanbra, the leading Brazilian producer of edible oil products.</p>
<p>Where the pattern is not being sloughed off as an economy develops it
is likely to be- come a straightjacket, stunting growth, both of the
economy and of the economy’s busi- nesses. The pattern of
diversification within the small market which served Belgium so well in
Victorian days was clearly one of the reasons for the stagnation of the
country in this century and for its difficulty in generating new growth
businesses.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Quite different is business diversification based on market
expansion. The most visible and most important example today is the
multinational company. It will be dis- cussed in Chapter 59.</p></li>
<li><p>Equally important as a force pushing business toward
diversification is technology, Technology by its very nature tends to
branch. What starts out as a technology for one product, product line,
or market soon becomes a whole family of technologies generating a
multitude of different products for a great number of different
markets.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Both the electrical and the chemical industries were founded in the
third quarter of the nineteenth century on two or three processes
leading to two or three products for two or three markets. The
electrical industry was based on the dynamo and on the electric light
bulb, to which shortly thereafter the electric streetcar was added. The
modern chemical industry has three roots: explosives for mining and
railroad building; chlorine, largely for the paper and textile
industries; and dyestuffs for the textile industry.</p>
<p>Within twenty-five years these technologies branched out into a
multitude of different products and product lines for different markets.
By 1900, General Electric and Siemens, Hoechst in Germany and Brunner
Mond (one of the forerunners of Britain’s Imperial Chemical Industries),
had already become conglomerates in the fullest meaning of the word. By
now the major electric-apparatus and chemical companies are the most
con- glomerate of all the conglomerates, exceeding even an ITT in the
number of different businesses, different processes, different product
lines, and different markets they are engaged in.</p>
<p>This diversification was not planned: it grew out of what happened in
a test tube in the laboratory or on the drawing board of a machine
designer. Technology begat new tech- nology—and business diversification
then followed.</p>
<p>These dynamics of technology are at work not only in material, i.e.,
“technical” areas, but equally in social technology and services.</p>
<p>Today’s American commercial bank is truly a conglomerate in the
services it offers. It is diversified perhaps beyond easy manageability.
Yet each of the services developed out of the others. Each developed as
a result of a new capacity to provide a financial service fashioned out
of existing knowledge, to meet a new need of an old customer, or to make
old services suitable for new customers.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Another extraneous factor, and one that is rarely taken into account
by economists, is the thrust of modern tax legislation.</li>
</ol>
<p>In practically every developed country the tax laws put a high
premium on a com- pany’s reinvesting capital in its business rather than
paying it back to the investors. Capi- tal paid out is not considered
repayment but a distribution of profits and taxed accord- ingly. It is
therefore far more economical for the investors—and for the company as
well—to diversify with capital that is no longer needed in a company’s
original business.</p>
<p>A perfect example is the origin of the diversification which
converted W. R. Grace andandandand Co. from a fairly small business
engaged in shipping, trade, and a little manufacturing in the small
countries along South America’s west coast into one of the major
chemical companies of the United States.</p>
<p>Latin America has traditionally found itself with a tremendous cash
surplus whenever there is war in Europe. The raw materials and
foodstuffs which Latin America produces then command very high prices,
while the money earned cannot be spent on manufactured goods from the
developed countries. W. R. Grace found itself therefore with cash on its
hands at the end of World War II. Diversification was the only way to
keep the money out of the clutches of the tax collector.</p>
<p>This is probably an extreme case. But on a smaller scale the same tax
considerations underlie a great many diversification moves, especially
of older companies in stable or declining industries where investment of
excess funds in the existing business would make little or no sense.</p>
<p>The tax laws of the developed countries which, in one way or another,
penalize the re- turn of excess capital to the investors—the American
tax laws, for instance, allow this only if the whole business is being
liquidated—are a powerful engine of diversification. That GM did not
spin off Chevrolet is in some degree also the fault of the tax system.
The tax laws were not, of course, designed for that purpose. On the
contrary. But altogether the effect of present day tax laws on
industrial concentration, on the emergence of con- glomerates, and on
bigness has been in every country almost the exact opposite of what tax
policy professes to believe in and to work for.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Finally as the last major pressure toward diversification there is
the emergence of what I call the “new markets,” the markets for
investment and capital as a “mass market,” and the emergence of the
market for jobs and careers as another mass market (on this see the
essay, “The New Markets and the New Entrepreneurs,” in my book, Men,
Ideas and Politics.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mass-market investor—and he is quite different from the old-style
capitalist is also a “customer.” The “product” that is value for him in
terms of a company’s securities must fit his expectations. Similarly the
young educated people today are customers in the mass market for jobs
and careers. And the “product,” that is the jobs and career opportu-
nities which an employer offers, also have to fit their expectations and
be “value” to them. And both of the new mass markets put high value on
diversification. Indeed, the growth of the conglomerate, and the
take-over fever of the late sixties, were in large measure first
responses to the demands and expectations of these new mass markets. As
first responses to new problems usually are, they were the wrong
responses. But the demands of these new mass markets will remain and
will have to be satisfied. And both, in large measure, will be satisfied
only by diversification.</p>
<p>Diversification, in fine, is a complex phenomenon. No matter how
preferable the pu- rity of concentration may be, all businesses need to
think through whether they need to diversify and how.</p>
<p>Some of the pressures that make for diversification may be
opportunities for a com- pany. Others are threats. Some, such as the tax
laws, reward the wrong and punish the right behavior. In some stages of
a company’s development, diversification, in other words, may be a
necessity. In others it may be highly desirable. In others yet, it may
be a temptation that should be sternly resisted.</p>
<p>Right and Wrong Diversification</p>
<p>The record shows clearly that there is right diversification and
there is wrong diversifica- tion.* The right diversification produces
businesses whose performance capacity almost equals that of the top
performers among highly concentrated, single-market or single-
technology companies. Wrong diversification produces businesses
performing as poorly as a single-market or single-technology firm that
is highly concentrated in the wrong business. And the difference is
always that the performing diversified company has a common core of
unity to its business or businesses.</p>
<p>This, however, implies that diversification is not something that can
be either con- demned or recommended as such. It is therefore a major
task of top management to de- cide what diversification and how much a
particular company needs to make the most of its strengths and to get
the best results from its resources.</p>
<p>One starting point must be the question “What is the least
diversification this business needs to accomplish its mission, obtain
its objectives, and continue to be viable and pros- perous?” But at the
same time the question “What is the most diversification we can man-
age, the most complexity this business can bear?” should also be asked.
The optimum will lie, as a rule, between the two extremes. The closer it
can come to the minimum needed, the more easily manageable will the
business be. The burden of proof always lies on those who want more
diversification rather than on those who want more concentration.</p>
<p>No matter how desirable concentration is, it may have to be
harmonized with diversi- fication. Otherwise it could become
overspecialization. But no matter how desirable—or indeed
inescapable—diversification is, it has to make possible concentration.
Otherwise it becomes splintering and diffusion. Simplicity and
complexity are both genuine needs. They pull the business in opposite
directions. Yet they must not be allowed to become conflicts. They must
instead be synthesized. To manage diversity by embedding it in a common
core of unity is a top-management task—and equally pressing in the
small, the fair-sized, and the big business.</p>
<p>*The study by Professor William Guth cited earlier also bears this
out.</p>
