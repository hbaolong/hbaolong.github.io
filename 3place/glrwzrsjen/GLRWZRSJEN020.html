Productive: Controls and Tools</h4>
<p>Control of Work and Process—Control Must Be a Tool of the
Worker—Control a Principle of Economy, Not of Morality—Inspection Is Not
Control—Routines and Ex- ceptions—The Patterns of Routines—Work and
Tools—Bigger Is Not Better— Modernization and Automation—Tools as the
Bridge Between Work and Working— Men Are Poor Machine Parts—The
Principle of Automation—Beyond Manual Work—Processing
Information—Application and Learning of Known Knowledge— What about the
Generation of New Knowledge? —The Challenge</p>
<p>ORK IS ductive,</p>
<p>A PROCESS, and any process needs to be controlled. To make work pro-
therefore, requires building the appropriate controls into the process
of</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>Specifically the process of production needs built-in controls in
respect to:</p>
<p>• its direction;</p>
<p>• its quality;</p>
<p>• the quantity it turns out in a given unit of time and with a given
input of working;</p>
<p>• its standards, such as machine maintenance or safety;</p>
<p>• its economy, that is, the efficiency with which it uses
resources.</p>
<p>Each work process needs its own controls. There is no “standard”
control, but all con- trol systems have to satisfy the same basic
demands and have to live up to the same over-</p>
<p>all specifications.</p>
<p>The most extreme cases of controls impeding work are not to be found
in manufactur- ing but in retailing and in the hospital. There controls
have been permitted to become an end in themselves to the point where
they encroach upon the work and seriously harm it.</p>
<p>In the department store a great many controls are undoubtedly
required. Each sale has to be recorded. There is need for information
for inventory control, billing, credit, deliv- ery, and so on. But in
far too many department stores the salesperson is supposed to pro- vide
all the control information. As a result, he or she has less and less
time to do what he is paid for, that is, selling. In some large American
retail stores, two-thirds of the sales- person’s time is devoted to
paperwork with only one-third left tor selling. The remedy is a simple
one and works wherever tried. Once the salesperson has done his or her
job, which is to serve the customer, the entire paperwork is turned over
to a separate clerk who ser- vices a number of sales people and does the
paperwork for them. The impact both on the ability of salespeople to
sell and on their morale is astonishing.</p>
<p>In the hospital, controls are needed in tremendous number, from
medical records to billing to the handling of insurance claims for
reimbursement, for the patient’s personal physician, and so on. Yet to
have the nurse handle this paper flood—as is the practice in the typical
hospital—is gross miscontrol. It makes the nurse deskbound so that she
has less and less time for the patient. Again the remedy is simple: a
floor clerk, usually a young management trainee in hospital
administration, who takes on the information load including providing
the nurse with what she needs herself to do her own job. This is not
only economical, since management trainees are paid much less than
nurses (and should, of course, be paid less), it is, above all, the
proper use of scarce skills.</p>
<p>It should always be remembered that control is a principle of economy
and not of mo- rality (on this see Chapter 39, “Controls, Control, and
Management”). The purpose of control is to make the process go smoothly,
properly, and according to high standards. The first question to ask of
the control system is whether it maintains the process within a
permissible range of deviation with the minimum effort. To spend a
dollar to protect 99 cents is not control. It is waste. “What is the
minimum of control that will maintain the process?” is the right
question to ask.</p>
<p>Seventy years ago this was clearly understood by the men who built
Sears, Roebuck.</p>
<p>In the early days of the mail-order business, the money in incoming
orders was not counted. The orders were weighed, unopened. (These were,
of course, the days when cur- rency was still metallic.) Sears, Roebuck
had run enough tests to know what average weights corresponded to
overall amounts of money—and this was sufficient control.</p>
<p>Many years later, in the 1951s, Marks andandandand Spencer similarly
developed a system of minimum controls. The late Lord Marks, it is said,
was appalled at the paperwork he found when he visited one of the
stores. He forthwith ordered all paperwork to be stopped. Control
instead is exercised by frequent small samples—and this greatly in-
creased the ability of the people in the store to sell and with it the
profitability of the busi- ness. It also increased the morale of the
people at work. They were finally able to do their work rather than to
waste time and effort on controls which impeded them.</p>
<p>The second thing to know about controls is their basic
characteristics. Controls have to be preset. There has to be a decision
as to the desired performance and as to the per- missible deviation from
the norm. Control has to be essentially by “exception”: only sig-
nificant deviation from the norm triggers the control. As long as the
process operates within the preset standards, it is under control and
does not require any action.</p>
<p>Third, control has to be by feedback from the work done. The work
itself has to pro- vide the information. If it has to be checked all the
time, there is no control.</p>
<p>One implication of this—and a very important one—is that inspection
is not control.</p>
<p>Inspection, especially final inspection, is, of course, needed for
both goods and services. But if used as control, it fast becomes
excessively cumbersome, excessively expensive, and a drag on the process
itself. Above all, it does not really control, even if there is 100
percent inspection, that is, if every product is tested and analyzed.
The end result would still be poor quality, excessive defects, and
malfunction.</p>
<p>Inspection, in other words, is the control of the control system
rather than the control system itself. And it too, to be effective, has
to satisfy the specifications of control, above all, the principle of
economy.</p>
<p>The control itself has to be exercised where the malfunction is
likely to occur. The control action may then be performed by the
machinery itself. The classical example is the governor on Watts’s steam
engine. Another one is the thermostat that runs the central heating unit
of the modern home.</p>
<p>Or the worker may be alerted to take the proper remedial action—and
this is also feedback control. What is important is not who takes the
action but what action to take. Equally important is that the action be
taken as a result of the working of the process itself and at the place
where the action is appropriate, that is, the place where correction of
the process, or a change in its direction (such as shutting off or
turning on the heating unit), is to be performed.</p>
<p>This implies that a control system has to designate the key point at
which control is to be built in. This is not primarily a technical
decision but a managerial one. At what point in the system is there
sufficient information to know whether control action is needed? At what
point in the system is there scope for effective action? Control at any
other point is undesirable. But so is control when it is too late, or
very late, to prevent damage. What part of the process requires
continuous control? What part requires control only at spe- cific
stages? Where is preventive control needed, or at least control at a
very early stage? And, where is control essentially remedial? These are
questions that are rarely being asked in designing a control system. Yet
unless they are being asked—and answered—a control system that truly
satisfies the needs of the work process cannot be designed.</p>
<p>Routines and Exceptions</p>
<p>A control system can control only the regular process. It must
identify genuine excep- tions, but it cannot handle them. It can only
make sure that they do not clog the process itself.</p>
<p>Any process is an attempt to make order out of the chaos of the
universe so that the great majority of phenomena, of actions, of
problems, of situations, can be routinized and do not require individual
and specific decision. A control system is a tool to enable men of
average competence to do things which if tackled as unique events could
be done only by exceptional skill, if not by genius. A control system
that violates this rule and tries to provide for handling the exceptions
will, therefore, defeat the process. It will sacrifice the 97 percent we
understand to the 3 percent we do not understand.</p>
<p>Exceptions can never be prevented but they can be eliminated from the
work process.</p>
<p>They then can be handled separately and as exceptions. To make a
control system take care of exceptions misdirects and undermines both
the work process and the control sys- tem.</p>
<p>The examples that best illustrate this are not to be found in
manufacturing industry but in the processing of information in the life
insurance business. Every life insurance com- pany handles every day a
veritable avalanche of death claims. Every life insurance com- pany has
learned that death claims have to be handled fast or else the company
rapidly loses its standing in the market. Hence, every life insurance
company long ago adapted the rule that routine death claims are to be
paid within twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>The great majority—well over 90 percent—of all the claims are routine
and need only to be checked off. Are all the needed forms provided? Is
all the required information in hand? If the answer is yes—and it should
not take more than a few seconds to find this out—payment is
authorized.</p>
<p>In a small number of cases, the information is not complete. The
death certificate is missing or it has not been signed by a physician or
it does not state a cause of death; the name on the death certificate is
different from the name on the policy; or the age is sig- nificantly
different, and other such, usually petty, clerical shortcomings.</p>
<p>Death claims are sorted alphabetically (or sometimes by area) when
they are received and then handed to a claims clerk to work up. In the
typical American company, until very recently, the claims clerk was
expected to handle all the claims in his or her area as they came in.
This usually meant that the claims clerk worked up a dozen claims and
then came to one where routine checking was not adequate control. The
claims clerk then be- gan to work on it. Sometimes he could settle the
problem in a few seconds, e.g., by send- ing it back to the agent in the
field with the appropriate form letter asking for whatever information
was lacking. But sometimes he had to spend half an hour or even an hour
on handling one claim. As a result, routine claims backed up. And by
twelve o’clock, the clerk was usually way behind, and routine claims
that should have been authorized for payment had not been processed.</p>
<p>The typical British insurance company handles this differently. There
the claims clerk inspects each claim to see whether it is routine or
not. Any claim that is not so simple that it can be cleared for payment
immediately is handed over to a special small group of “ex-</p>
<p>perts,” usually older and highly experienced claims clerks, who then
begin to work on it. In the meantime, the flow of routine claims
continues unimpeded.</p>
<p>There is yet another way of handling this, used in some European and
Japanese life in- surance companies. The claims clerk puts aside, on a
separate table, every claim which he cannot immediately clear for
payment. So do three or four other claims clerks working within the same
claims unit. When the pile of routine claims has dwindled and the pile
of non-routine claims has grown, say, around 10:30 or 11 in the morning,
the claims clerks then divide the unusual claims among them according to
their workload at the moment. As a result, they usually manage to work
up all claims, routine and non-routine, by noon in the morning and by
closing time in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The traditional American system is misapplication of control. It
subordinates the rou- tine to the exceptions. The traditional British
system is effective control. It eliminates the exceptions from the
process, which keeps flowing. But it stultifies the worker; it is a good
control system for a machine process rather than for human work. The
German or Japa- nese system satisfies both the demands of work and those
of working.</p>
<p>The best control system, however, is not found in business. It is the
differential diag- nosis of the physician as it was developed in the
early nineteenth century. The differential diagnosis proceeds from the
ascertainable systems in a preset order. It eliminates step by step all
the inapplicable diagnoses, that is, all the exceptions. It makes the
process of dis- covery into a routine.</p>
<p>To design a control system, one has to think through what is routine
and what is ex- ception.</p>
<p>The Patterns of Routines</p>
<p>There are three patterns of routines. First is the pattern in which
both input and output are highly standardized. This is the case in rigid
mass production—but in flexible mass pro- duction as well.</p>
<p>Life insurance claims belong in this pattern. The input is totally
standardized—a claim for payment because of one event, death of the
policyholder. The output is equally stan- dardized. It is a check in
payment of the claim. Only the amount of the check varies. And the
amount, of course, is determined in advance by the policy itself. The
handling of life insurance death claims is a perfect example of rigid
mass production—perhaps a better one than the automobile assembly line.
In this pattern, control consists of organizing the routine flow and
eliminating the exceptions to be handled separately.</p>
<p>In the second pattern, the apparent diversity of events actually
represents a configura- tion of sub-patterns, each of which is highly
routinized. One example is casualty insur- ance, such as insurance
against fire, burglary, losses at sea, and so on. Here there seems to be
bewildering variety both of risks and of claims. Actually, there are no
more than half a dozen patterns.</p>
<p>Another example is the hospital. The first impression is one of total
unpredictability.</p>
<p>Each “process,” i.e., each patient, seems to require a unique control
system of his own; this is the way most physicians see the hospital.
Actually, there are no more sub-patterns in a hospital than there are in
a casualty insurance business, let alone in many manufactur- ing
businesses. A dozen or so common illnesses account for 90 percent or
more of all patient days in the hospital. Each of these illnesses
requires medical care within a known and fairly narrow range of
procedures, makes predictable demands on hospital facilities such as
operating theaters, X-ray, medical laboratories, and physical therapy,
and has a predictable prognosis within a narrow range. For each there is
an average to which the great majority of events closely conforms. A
hospital can, therefore, be controlled by con- trolling a fairly small
number of preset patterns. The exceptions are important—indeed, they are
often the most difficult medical challenges. But they are being
controlled by be- ing taken out of the system and treated as genuine
exceptions, that is, as truly unique events.</p>
<p>Wherever a process seems unpredictable the most probable assumption
is that it actu- ally consists of a number of highly predictable
sub-patterns. They appear unpredictable only because they interfere with
each other. The key to designing a control system is to identify these
sub-patterns. Each can then be routinized, standards can be set, and a
con- trol system established that makes sure that the process operates
within a preset range of</p>
<p>Finally, there are processes where unique events prevail. They are
rare in manufactur- ing; even unique-product production usually consists
of a fairly small number of highly predictable, repetitive sub-patterns.
But unique-event processes are found, fairly fre-</p>
<p>quently, in some service work.</p>
<p>Workmen’s compensation insurance, which provides for the payment of
lost income and damages to people injured while working and as a result
of their work—but also for the medical costs and the rehabilitation of
men contracting occupation-related diseases— is such a process. No two
claims are basically alike. Each has to be treated as a separate claim,
with respect not only to the payment due, but to the medical, surgical,
or rehabilita- tion action required. Each frequently also calls for
changes in work methods or in the tools used in order to eliminate or
lessen the hazard for the future. Yet the claims adjuster of workmen’s
compensation insurers has to have almost complete authority to settle
claims. The great majority of claims is settled speedily, to the
satisfaction of both the em- ployer and the injured worker, and with a
high success in cure or rehabilitation. Work- men’s compensation plans
have a better record of medical performance than most medical practice
has.</p>
<p>The way to handle this pattern of unique events is to think through
and define the standards. What are the minimum standards which every
single piece of work, e.g., a set- tled workmen’s compensation claim,
has to satisfy in respect to the investigation of the claim, to the
management of the medical or surgical work needed, to the time it takes
for settlement, and so on? What, in other words, are the measurements by
which a claims adjuster can measure and direct himself? To be sure, even
in such a situation of unique events, there are patterns. But there are
too many, and each of them embraces too small a proportion of the total
phenomenon, to devise a control system for each pattern. The only
control—but a very effective one—is standards which enable the
individual worker to develop his own routine and his own control.</p>
<p>This last pattern is of particular importance because it is the
typical pattern for such knowledge work as teaching, medical practice,
and any other professional work. The pro- fessional, by definition,
works by himself. By definition he also deals with unique events—unique
at least within the small universe to which an individual professional
is exposed. And then control has to be by standards. The dissatisfaction
with the profes- sional that is so widespread today—whether teacher,
lawyer, or doctor—is largely based on the lack of such standards, that
is, on the lack of a control system appropriate to a unique-events
process.</p>
<p>Work and Tools</p>
<p>The final step in making work productive is to fit the right tools to
the work. Different kinds of work require different tools. There are far
too many tools, from very simple to very complex, and from very small to
giant, to be analyzed and presented even in the big- gest book. And tool
design, tool organization, and tool application are technical subjects
rather than managerial ones.</p>
<p>Yet the manager, whether he manages industrial production, the
processing of infor- mation, or knowledge work, needs to understand the
basic managerial requirements of tool usage.</p>
<p>A tool is not necessarily better because it is bigger. A tool is best
if it does the job re- quired with a minimum of effort, with a minimum
of complexity, and with a minimum of power.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, most assembly-line work, while fully
mechanized, is done with small hand tools. They are modified to serve
the particular job to be done. But they are still hammers, screwdrivers,
mallets, pliers, and so on. Good assembly-line tooling provides the
worker with the simplest tool he needs for a given job, when he needs
it, and wherever he needs it.</p>
<p>This needs to be stressed. For it is one of the weaknesses of
technology—or rather of technologists—that bigger is considered
better.</p>
<p>The worst offender throughout history has been the military. It has
always been hyp- notized by bigness and complexity. Some of the worst
military disasters of history have been the result. It was the worship
of bigness that defeated the Persians when they at- tacked Greece. The
Mongols in the thirteenth century overran Europe because the knights of
chivalry were hypnotized by “advanced technology.” They became the
victims of their own and their horses’ heavy armor and heavy weapons
while the Mongols, on small and light ponies, with a minimum of
weaponry, could ride rings around them. Similarly, Hitler lost in Russia
to a large extent because he put his trust in heavy tanks and in heavy
artil- lery which could not maneuver, let alone be supplied, on the soft
and roadless plains of Russia. And Vietnam taught a similar lesson.</p>
<p>Mechanization and Automation</p>
<p>The most important thing for a manager to know about tools and work
is, however, that tools are the bridge between work and working. Tools
serve the work. They also serve the worker. They must, therefore, be
engineered for making both work productive and the worker achieve. This
requires that the manager understand what mechanization is and what
constitutes proper mechanization.</p>
<p>Mechanization is a fairly recent word. Most people believe that it
pertains only to modern tools, that is, to the tools of an advanced
technology. But all tools are “mechani- zation.” Over the millennia we
have changed the energy source for tools—from human and animal muscle to
wind and water and to fossil fuels and nuclear power. But tools have
changed very little. Tools from the beginning were a uniquely human
phenomenon. All tools are an extension of man. They either extend his
body, as does the hammer, or they extend his mind, as do multiplication
table and computer. Or they provide man with ca- pacities for which his
own body is not engineered—such as the wheel or the ax. But all tools
are tools of man and must, therefore, serve him in his double need of
making work productive and worker achieving.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of fear today that modern technology is
becoming man’s master rather than his servant. The definitive comment on
this was given to me many years ago by a student who was one of the
early computer engineers. “I am being asked all the</p>
<p>time,” said the young man, “whether I am not afraid of becoming the
computer’s servant.</p>
<p>I do not understand the question. All I have to do is pull the
plug.”</p>
<p>While the fear of technology becoming the master and enslaving man is
unfounded— and professed by people who know nothing about technology and
understand even less (and who, in addition, tend to believe that
technology is an invention of the industrial revolution)—there is real
danger that mechanization will be misapplied. Mechanization to be
properly applied must always extend the sphere of human capacity, must
always add to man’s capacity to achieve. If it does not do this, it is
poor engineering. It will not even make work more productive. It will,
in effect, cut down output.</p>
<p>Specifically, there are two dangers to watch out for. The first is
the danger of making man a part of the machine. Men are very poor
machine parts. If the human effort is misengineered into the system so
that it does machine work, the system works poorly. The second danger is
to misuse the tool as a divisive element in the work group, thus
frustrat- ing man’s basic need to establish a community bond through
working.</p>
<p>The modern assembly line, as Henry Ford set it up, does both. Man on
the traditional automobile assembly line is, in effect, a part of the
machinery. He does very poorly, very slowly, and very sloppily what a
machine should be doing. This is the essence of doing one repetitive
motion at the same unvarying speed and rhythm over and over and over
again. Worse still, the automobile assembly line makes each man a threat
rather than a resource to his fellow worker. If one man on the line
works a little faster, he threatens his neighbor. Working at his most
productive, that is, with varying speeds and rhythms, be- comes a threat
to everybody else. And he cannot, by working better, help his neighbor.
He is confined to his operation.</p>
<p>This, it should be said again, is not inherent in the assembly line.
It is poor engineer- ing of the assembly line. We shall see (in Chapter
21) that these defects can be over- come—even on the traditional
automobile assembly line. They are, indeed, in the process of being
overcome. But they are symptomatic of what happens if managers—or engi-
neers—forget that tools are the bridge between work and working, and
engineer the tools so as to serve the work alone.</p>
<p>What is to be done when mechanization becomes inimical to working,
that is, when the organization of the tool that is most conducive to
making work productive threatens to do harm to working and worker? One
answer—the one that is available in most cases—is to re-engineer
mechanization, as will be discussed in Chapter 21. The other answer is
to transcend mechanization and move to automation.</p>
<p>The term automation is a fairly new one. It was coined in the late
1940s by a Ford Motor Company executive. The concept, however, is much
older.</p>
<p>The best illustration of what automation means antedates the term—let
alone public concern with the phenomenon—by many decades. It is the
telephone system. The tele- phone system does not work “untouched by
human hands,” nor does it operate without human work. The user, in
dialing the number he wants to reach, programs the system. And this is
“work.” But given these instructions, the system runs itself, switches
to the appropriate channels, returns a signal that tells the dialer
whether his call goes through or not, and disconnects at the end of the
conversation. It also does the ancillary work, such as recording the
calls for billing purposes. If need be, it could easily perform
additional chores such as signaling a repair center that a line is out
of order.</p>
<p>The telephone exchange exhibits the four principles of automation.
First, the entire process is seen as a system. There is, so to speak, no
beginning and no end. Everything is integrated. Second, the system is
based on the assumption that phenomena of the natural universe fall into
discernible patterns and can be routinized on the basis of a probability
distribution. Third, the system controls itself through feedback.</p>
<p>Finally, the human worker does not work. He programs. He makes
decisions based on judgment within the range of patterns the system is
designed to handle. He may be almost totally unskilled—as is the user of
the telephone. Or he may be exceedingly highly skilled, e.g., the people
who design microcircuits on automated equipment such as com- puters, to
be produced by totally automated equipment. But whether skilled or
unskilled,</p>
<p>the worker is discriminating. His tool is judgment rather than manual
or even conceptual skill.</p>
<p>Whenever mechanization reaches the point where the worker is
engineered to be a machine part, we can automate. We can design a
machine to do machine’s work. This</p>
<p>may not, in a given case, be desirable or economical. We may not even
have the technol- ogy as yet to do it, but it is always possible. It is
not necessarily the best alternative to re- engineering mechanization to
make it serve working as well as work, but it is always an alternative
that should be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Automation is not an arrangement of machines. It is not the ultimate
in mechanization.</p>
<p>It is a basically different concept. It can work perfectly without
any machines. The aba- cus, which Japanese and Chinese ten-year-olds use
with high speed and accuracy, is, in effect, automation and data
processing, fully as advanced and as sophisticated as anything the
computer does. It does not require machinery and advanced technology,
but it embod- ies the basic concept of automation.</p>
<p>Any work needs its tools. Any work, therefore, needs to be
mechanized. “The work- man is only as good as his tools”; but it is also
true that the tools work only as well as the workman. In designing tools
for work, therefore, the manager has to be conscious of both dimensions,
that is, of work and working.</p>
<p>Beyond Manual Work</p>
<p>Work analysis, principles of production, controls, and tools have
primarily been worked out, at least in systematic fashion with respect
to manual work. Up till very recently the bulk of all people did manual
work. Manual work, in turn, produced the overwhelming preponderance of
whatever was being produced.</p>
<p>In a modern economy and society, however, manual work is increasingly
of less im- portance—thanks primarily to our advances in understanding
and organizing work and our resulting ability to make work productive.
Hence, the question arises whether the same approaches, the same
concepts, and the same principles apply to other than manual work.</p>
<p>There is no question of the applicability of the same approaches and
the same princi- ples to manual work which is not technically,
production, that is, to manual work on the railroad, in construction,
and other kinds of physical work which the economist does not consider
to be agriculture, mining, or manufacturing, but “services.” This is a
distinction of great importance to economics but of none to management.
It is also clear that the same approaches, principles, and methods
apply, almost without change, to the processing of information, that is,
to most clerical work.</p>
<p>Turning out insurance policies, handling orders, billing, key punch
operations, and most accounting work are essentially production work.
Indeed, most clerical work is mass production—some rigid, some flexible.
It requires the same industrial engineering, that is, the same analysis
of work, as manual work, the same process of production, the same kinds
of control.</p>
<p>Processing information is easier to organize than most physical
production. Informa- tion always comes coded in fairly simple form,
electric impulses, figures, words, or, at its most complex, graphic
information composed of a few parts, i.e., light, shadows, and at most a
few colors.</p>
<p>Processing information, therefore, can always be done by
standardizing the parts and assembling the final product, that is, by
mass production.</p>
<p>Most true services work is not fundamentally different from producing
things insofar as the principles of work are concerned. Selling in a
retail store is basically flexible mass production. The individual sale
varies greatly. The process varies hardly at all. And it can be
organized in standardized parts. It is best organized so as to give the
retail clerk a pre- designed routine with the appropriate tools but with
wide latitude of judgment. Unless, however, the routine has been
designed and the tools supplied, even the best judgment on the part of
an experienced retail clerk will not produce sales.</p>
<p>ple, already mentioned, is the differential diagnosis which the
nineteenth-century physi- cian worked out. Even older is the
systematizing of the work of the surgeon—both the basic analysis and the
integration of steps into a process were done during the eighteenth
century, especially by the great English surgeon John Hunter
(1728-1793).</p>
<p>The blueprint also antedates modern work study—it is a product of the
mid-nineteenth century. It also is a systematic and purposeful
application of the same basic work con- cepts to the application of
knowledge.</p>
<p>The most important example of the application of the approaches and
principles of work study and work organization to a knowledge area is,
however, acquisition of exist-</p>
<p>ing knowledge, that is, learning.</p>
<p>For thousands of years people have been talking about improving
teaching—to no avail. It was not until the early years of this century,
however, that an educator asked, “What is the end product?” Then the
answer was obvious: It is not teaching. It is, of</p>
<p>course, learning. And then the same educator, the great Italian
doctor and teacher Maria Montessori (1870-1952), began to apply
systematic analysis of the work and systematic integration of the parts
into a process—without, of course, any awareness that this was what she
was doing. Montessori’s own system is surely not the “final answer.” But
her approaches have provided the foundation for all subsequent work,
e.g., that of the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget, who has studied how
children learn, and of the American behav- iorists who have studied
learning as a dynamic process of continuous work with its own logic and
its own controls. The English open classroom in which the work of these
people has been embodied in a real learning environment may be the first
major change in educa- tion and the first systematic learning work. Its
methodology is specifically the analysis of the work, the integration of
the work into a process—a cross between flexible mass pro- duction and
true process production—the design of the appropriate control system and
the provision of the appropriate tools.</p>
<p>These examples show that the application and learning of knowledge
are fundamen- tally no different from any other work. To be sure, the
product is entirely different and so are the materials and the tools.
But the process is basically the same. In its application lies one of
the greatest managerial opportunities for making work productive.</p>
<p>The most conspicuous area in which we need to organize as systematic
work the ap- plication and acquisition of already existing knowledge is
perhaps the development work in industry, i.e., the work of converting
new knowledge into marketable products or mar- ketable services. The
knowledge is already there as a result of research or invention. What is
needed now is to apply what we already know. This, by and large, is not
yet done sys- tematically. Where, however, development work has been
organized on the methodology of work (and again, primarily as flexible
mass production), as in some pharmaceutical companies, the results have
been impressive, in the speed of the work, in its productivity, and in
the economic success of the developed product or service.</p>
<p>The one area in which it is not yet proven that the systematic
methodology of work applies is the generation of new knowledge, whether
invention or research. There is, how- ever, considerable reason to
believe that the same methodology should apply at least to substantial
parts of the activity.</p>
<p>Edison, perhaps the most productive inventor of the nineteenth
century, applied a sys- tematic method to make inventing work
productive. He always started out with a clear definition of the product
desired. He then broke down the process into constituent parts and
worked out their relationship and sequence. He set specific controls for
key points. He laid down the standards, and so on. To be sure, Edison
did not take out the “creative spark.” But he tried, and successfully,
to give creativity a solid foundation in system and method. One
indication that he may have been on the right path is the large number
of his assistants who became successful inventors in their own right,
though clearly devoid of</p>
<p>outstanding creativity—e.g., Frank J. Sprague (1857-1934), who was by
all accounts a mere plodder but whose inventions were largely
responsible for the electric streetcar.</p>
<p>But so far, we have only a few isolated examples—enough to indicate
potential but not enough for proof. Clearly, there are limits to
methodology—the artist’s vision lies well outside its scope (though the
artist’s work does not). But research, that is, the organ- ized search
for new scientific or industrial knowledge, falls in all probability
well within these limitations.</p>
