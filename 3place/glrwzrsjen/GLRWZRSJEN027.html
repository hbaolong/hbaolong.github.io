Problems</h4>
<p>Responsibility for Impacts—The High Price of Neglect—Anticipating
Impacts— “Technology Assessment” or “Technology Monitoring” —How to Deal
with Im- pacts—Their Elimination as a Business Opportunity—When
Regulation Is Needed— The Trade-Offs—Impacts as Business
Responsibility—Social Problems as Business Opportunities—Solving a
Social Problem—Sears, Ford, IBM—Second Careers for the Middle-Aged
Knowledge Worker—The “Degenerative Diseases” of Society—Are There Limits
to Social Responsibility?</p>
<p>S</p>
<p>OCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES—whether of a business, a hospital, or a
university— may arise in two areas. They may emerge out of the social
impacts of the institution. Or they arise as problems of the society
itself. Both are of concern to management because the institution which
managers manage lives of necessity in society and commu- nity. But
otherwise the two areas are different The first deals with what an
institution does to society. The second is concerned with what an
institution can do for society.</p>
<p>The modern organization exists to provide a specific service to
society. It therefore has to be in society. It has to be in a community,
has to be a neighbor, has to do its work within a social setting. But
also it has to employ people to do its work. Its social impacts
inevitably go beyond the specific contribution it exists to make.</p>
<p>The purpose of the hospital is not to employ nurses and cooks. It is
patient care. But to accomplish this purpose, nurses and cooks are
needed. And in no time at all they form a work community with its own
community tasks and community problems.</p>
<p>The purpose of a ferroalloy plant is not to make noise or to release
noxious fumes. It is to make high-performance metals that serve the
customer. But in order to do this, it produces noise, creates heat, and
releases fumes.</p>
<p>Nobody in his right senses wants to create a traffic jam. But if a
lot of people are em- ployed in one place and have to enter and leave at
the same time, a traffic jam will be a totally unintended and yet
inescapable by-product.</p>
<p>These impacts are incidental to the purpose of the organization. But
in large measure they are inescapable by-products.</p>
<p>Social problems, by contrast, are dysfunctions of society rather than
impacts of the or- ganization and its activities.</p>
<p>The steel company discussed in the preceding chapter did, of course,
practice racial discrimination. But racial discrimination was not caused
by its activities; it was not an impact. On the contrary, the racial
problem of the old South has all along been considered by business a
major obstacle to industrialization and economic development. It has
been an external condition to which any institution operating in
southern society had to con- form. Similarly, Swift do Argentina—or the
Argentinean meat-packers as a whole—did not cause the long-time secular
decline of the Argentinean livestock industry and the re- sulting
unemployment in the Port of Buenos Aires. On the contrary, they fought
the gov- ernment policies responsible for the decline.</p>
<p>Still, both the U.S. steel company operating in the South and Swift
do Argentina could not escape concern. Such problems are the
degenerative diseases or the toxic wastes of the society and community
in which a business exists. Since the institution can exist only within
the social environment, is indeed an organ of society, such social
problems affect the institution. They are of concern to it even if, as
in the steel company’s case, the com- munity itself sees no problem and
resists any attempt to tackle it.</p>
<p>A healthy business, a healthy university, a healthy hospital cannot
exist in a sick soci- ety. Management has a self-interest in a healthy
society, even though the cause of soci- ety’s sickness is none of
management’s making.</p>
<p>Responsibility for Impacts</p>
<p>One is responsible for one’s impacts, whether they are intended or
not. This is the first rule. There is no doubt regarding management’s
responsibility for the social impacts of its organization. They are
management’s business.</p>
<p>In the Union Carbide story in the preceding chapter, the main reason
why the commu- nity became so incensed against the company was probably
not the pollution it caused. The community knew as well as Union Carbide
that the pollution was incidental to pro- duction, and thereby to the
jobs on which the community depended. But what the com- munity bitterly
resented, and with reason, was Union Carbide’s refusal for long years to
accept responsibility. This is indeed irresponsible.</p>
<p>Because one is responsible for one’s impacts, one minimizes them. The
fewer impacts an institution has outside of its own specific purpose and
mission, the better does it con- duct itself, the more responsibly does
it act, and the more acceptable a citizen, neighbor, and contributor it
is. Impacts which are not essential, and which are not part of the dis-
charge of one’s own specific purpose and mission, should be kept to the
absolute mini- mum. Even if they appear to be beneficial, they are
outside the proper boundaries of one’s function and will, therefore,
sooner or later be resented, be resisted, and be considered
impositions.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons why management should, in its own
self-interest, foster self- government of the work community (see
Chapter 21) is precisely that the community functions of the plant are
incidental to the purpose of the business. They are not essential to it.
The business exists to produce shoes or candy, or to turn out insurance
policies. Any control that goes beyond what is strictly necessary to get
the work done is incidental to the main function. It is an impact. And
it should, therefore, be minimized, if it cannot be eliminated.</p>
<p>Impacts are at best a nuisance. At worst they are deleterious. They
are never benefi- cial. Indeed they always carry within themselves a
cost and a threat. Impacts use up re- sources, burn up or waste raw
materials, or at the least, tie up management efforts. Yet they add
nothing to the value of the product or to the customer’s satisfaction.
They are “friction,” that is, nonproductive cost.</p>
<p>But even minor impacts are likely to become “crises” and “scandal”
and to result in serious damage to business—or to any other institution
that disregards its impacts. What only yesterday seemed harmless—and
indeed even popular—suddenly becomes an of- fense, a public outcry, a
major issue. Unless management has taken responsibility for the impact,
thought it through, and worked out the optimal resolution, the result
will be puni- tive or restrictive legislation and an outcry against the
“greed of business” or the “irre- sponsibility of the university.”</p>
<p>It is not enough to say, “But the public doesn’t object.” It is,
above all, not enough to say that any action to come to grips with such
a problem is going to be “unpopular,” is going to be “resented” by one’s
colleagues and one’s associates, and is not required. Sooner or later
society will come to regard any such impact as an attack on its
integrity and will exact a high price from those who have not
responsibly worked on eliminating the impact or on finding a solution to
the problem.</p>
<p>Here are some examples.</p>
<p>In the late forties and early fifties, one American automobile
company tried to make the American public safety-conscious. Ford
introduced cars with seat belts. But sales dropped catastrophically. The
company had to withdraw the cars with seat belts and abandoned the whole
idea. When, fifteen years later, the American driving public became
safety-conscious, the car manufacturers were sharply attacked for their
“total lack of con- cern with safety” and for being “merchants of
death.” And the resulting regulations were written as much to punish the
companies as to protect the public.</p>
<p>Several large electric-power companies had tried for years to get the
various state util- ity commissions to approve low-sulfur fuels and
cleaning devices in smokestacks. The commissions discouraged them again
and again, with the argument that the public was entitled to power at
the lowest possible cost. They pointed out that neither a more expen-
sive fuel nor capital investment to clean the smoke could be permitted
in the rate base as a legitimate cost under the state laws. Yet when
eventually air pollution became a matter of public concern, the same
power companies were roundly berated for “befouling the envi-
ronment.”</p>
<p>Public-service institutions similarly pay the price of neglecting
impacts or of dismiss- ing them as trivial. Columbia University was
almost destroyed because it did not take responsibility for an impact
but had comforted itself with the notion that the impact was trivial.
The explosion which rocked Columbia to its foundations in 1968 came over
a per- fectly harmless and minor matter: a plan to build a new
university gymnasium which would be available equally to university
students and to the residents of the Black ghetto which abuts Columbia.
But the causes for the explosion lay much deeper. They were the
conviction on the part of Columbia and of its faculty that a liberal
educational institution does not have to concern itself with its
relations with its Black ghetto neighborhood.</p>
<p>Another example of impact is the business that is “too big” for its
own good and that of the community. (On this see Chapter 55, “On Being
the Wrong Size.”) The business that is too big, especially the business
that is too big for the local community, is a threat to its community
but, above all, to itself. It is incumbent on management to correct the
situa- tion in the interest of the business (or of the university or
hospital). To ignore the problem is to put ego, desire for power, and
vanity ahead of the good of the institution and of the community. And
this is irresponsible.</p>
<p>Identifying Impacts</p>
<p>The first job of management is, therefore, to identify and to
anticipate impacts—coldly and realistically. The question is not “Is
what we do right?” It is “Is what we do what so- ciety and the customer
pay us for?” And if an activity is not integral to the institution’s
purpose and mission, it is to be considered as a social impact and as
undesirable.</p>
<p>This sounds easy. It is actually very difficult. The best
illustration is the problem of “technology assessment,” that is, the
identification of social and economic impacts of new technology at the
time of its introduction.</p>
<p>There is, these days, great interest in technology assessment, that
is in anticipating im- pact and side effects of new technology before
going ahead with it. The U.S. Congress has actually set up an Office of
Technology Assessment. This new agency is expected to be able to predict
what new technologies are likely co become important, and what long-
range effects they are likely to have. It is then expected to advise
government what new technologies to encourage and what new technologies
to discourage, if not to forbid alto- gether.</p>
<p>This attempt can end only in fiasco. Technology assessment of this
kind is likely to lead to the encouragement of the wrong technologies
and the discouragement of the tech- nologies we need. For future impacts
of new technology are almost always beyond any- body’s imagination.</p>
<p>DDT is an example. It was synthesized during World War II to protect
American sol- diers against disease-carrying insects, especially in the
tropics. Some of the scientists then envisaged the use of the new
chemical to protect civilian populations as well. But not one</p>
<p>of the many men who worked on DDT thought of applying the new
pesticide to control insect pests infesting crops, forests, or
livestock. If DDT had been restricted to the use for which it was
developed, that is, to the protection of humans, it would never have
become an environmental hazard; use for this purpose accounted for no
more than 5 or 10 percent of the total at DDT’s peak, in the
mid-sixties. Farmers and foresters, without much help from the
scientists, saw that what killed lice on men would also kill lice on
plants and made DDT into a massive assault on the environment.</p>
<p>Another example is the population explosion in the developing
countries. DDT and other pesticides were a factor in it. So were the new
antibiotics. Yet the two were devel- oped quite independently of each
other; and no one “assessing” either technology could have foreseen
their convergence—indeed no one did. But more important as causative
factors in the sharp drop in infant mortality which set off the
population explosion were two very old “technologies” to which no one
paid any attention. One was the elementary public-health measure of
keeping latrine and well apart—known to the Macedonians be- fore
Alexander the Great. The other one was the wire-mesh screen for doors
and windows invented by an unknown American around 1860. Both were
suddenly adopted even by backward tropical villages after World War II.
Together they were probably the main causes of the population
explosion.</p>
<p>At the same time, the technology impacts which the experts predict
almost never oc- cur. One example is the “private flying boom,” which
the experts predicted during and shortly after World War II. The private
plane, owner-piloted, would become as common, we were told, as the Model
T automobile had become after World War I. Indeed, experts among city
planners, engineers, and architects advised New York City not to go
ahead with the second tube of the Lincoln Tunnel, or with the second
deck on the George Wash- ington Bridge, and instead to build a number of
small airports along the west bank of the Hudson River. It would have
taken fairly elementary mathematics to disprove this particu- lar
technology assessment—there just is not enough airspace for commuter
traffic by air. But this did not occur to any of the experts; no one
then realized how finite airspace is. At the same time, almost no
experts foresaw the expansion of commercial air traffic and an-
ticipated, at the time the jet plane was first developed, that it would
lead to mass transpor- tation by air, with as many people crossing the
Atlantic in jumbo jets in one day as used to go in a week in the big
passenger liners. To be sure, transatlantic travel was expected to grow
fast—but of course it would be by ship. These were the years in which
all the gov- ernments along the North Atlantic heavily subsidized the
building of new super-luxury liners, just when the passengers deserted
the liner and switched to the new jet plane.</p>
<p>A few years later, we were told by everybody that automation would
have tremendous economic and social impacts—it has had practically none.
The computer offers an even odder story. In the late forties nobody
predicted that the computer would be used by busi- ness and governments.
While the computer was a “major scientific revolution,” every- body
“knew” that its main use would be in science and warfare. As a result,
the most ex- tensive market research study undertaken at that time
reached the conclusion that the world computer market would, at most, be
able to absorb 1,000 computers by the year</p>
<ol start="2000" type="1">
<li>Now, only twenty-five years later, there are some 150,000 computers
installed in the world, most of them doing the most mundane bookkeeping
work. Then a few years later, when it became apparent that business was
buying computers for payroll and billing, the experts predicted that the
computer would displace middle management, so that there would be nobody
left between the chief executive officer and the foreman. “Is middle
management obsolete?” asked a widely quoted Harvard Business Review
article in the early fifties; and it, answered this rhetorical question
with a resounding “Yes.” At exactly that moment, the tremendous
expansion of middle-management jobs began. In every de- veloped country
middle-management jobs, in business as well as in government, have grown
about three times as fast as total employment in the last twenty years;
and their growth has been parallel to the growth of computer usage.
Anyone depending on technol- ogy assessment in the early 1950s would
have abolished the graduate business schools as likely to produce
graduates who could not possibly find jobs. Fortunately, the young
peo-</li>
</ol>
<p>ple did not listen and flocked in record numbers to the graduate
business schools so as to get the good jobs which the computer helped
create. (For the middle-management boom, see Chapter 35.)</p>
<p>But while no one foresaw the computer impact on middle-management
jobs, every expert predicted a tremendous computer impact on business
strategy, business policy, planning, and top management—on none of which
the computer has, however, had the slightest impact at all. At the same
time, no one predicted the real revolution in business policy and
strategy in the fifties and sixties, the merger wave and the
conglomerates.</p>
<p>It is not only that man has the gift of prophecy no more with respect
to technology than with respect to anything else. The impacts of
technology are actually more difficult to predict than most other
developments. In the first place, as the example of the popula- tion
explosion shows, social and economic impact are almost always the result
of the con- vergence of a substantial number of factors, not all of them
technological. And each of these factors has its own origin, its own
development, its own dynamics, and its own ex- perts. The expert in one
field—e.g. the expert on epidemiology—never thinks of plant pests. The
expert on antibiotics is concerned with the treatment of disease,
whereas the actual explosion of the birthrate resulted largely from
elementary and long-known public health measures.</p>
<p>But equally important, what technology is likely to become important
and have an im- pact, and what technology either will fizzle out—like
the “flying Model T”—or will have minimal social or economic
impacts—like automation—is impossible to predict. And which technology
will have social impacts and which will remain just technology is even
harder to predict. The most successful prophet of technology, Jules
Verne, predicted a great deal of twentieth-century technology a hundred
years ago (though few scientists or technologists of that time took him
seriously). But he anticipated absolutely no social or economic impacts,
only an unchanged mid-Victorian society and economy. Economic and social
prophets, in turn, have the most dismal record as predictors of
technology.</p>
<p>The one and only effect an Office of Technology Assessment is
therefore likely to have would be to guarantee full employment to a lot
of fifth-rate science-fiction writers.</p>
<p>The Need for Technology Monitoring</p>
<p>The major danger is, however, that the delusion that we can foresee
the impacts of new technology will lead us to slight the really
important task, For technology does have im- pacts and serious ones,
beneficial as well as detrimental. These do not require prophecy. They
require careful monitoring of the actual impact of a technology once it
has become effective. In 1948, practically no one correctly saw the
impacts of the computer. Five or six years later, one could and did
know. Then one could say, “Whatever the technological impact, socially
and economically this is not a major threat.” In 1943, no one could pre-
dict the impact of DDT. Ten years later, DDT had become worldwide a tool
of farmer, forester, and livestock breeder, and as such, a major
ecological factor. Then thinking as to what action to take should have
begun, work should have been started on the development of pesticides
without the major environmental impact of DDT, and the difficult
trade-offs should have been faced between food production and
environmental damage—which nei- ther the unlimited use nor the present
complete ban on DDT sufficiently considers.</p>
<p>Technology monitoring is a serious, an important, indeed a vital
task. But it is not prophecy. The only thing possible with respect to
new technology is speculation with about one chance out of a hundred of
being right—and a much better chance of doing harm by encouraging the
wrong, or discouraging the most beneficial new technology. What needs to
be watched is “developing” technology, that is, technology which has al-
ready had substantial impacts, enough to be judged, to be measured, to
be evaluated.</p>
<p>And monitoring a developing technology for its social impacts is,
above all, a mana- gerial responsibility.</p>
<p>But equally important—and totally overlooked by the advocates of
technology as- sessment—are the impacts of non-technological, that is
social and economic innovations</p>
<p>and developments. They are just as hard to predict until they have
emerged and can be identified, evaluated, and measured. They too,
therefore, need being monitored. And that too is a management
responsibility.</p>
<p>How to Deal with Impacts</p>
<p>Identifying incidental impacts of an institution is the first step.
But how does management deal with them? The objective is clear: impacts
on society and economy, community, and individual that are not in
themselves the purpose and mission of the institution should be kept to
the minimum and should preferably be eliminated altogether. The fewer
such im- pacts the better, whether the impact is within the institution,
on the social environment, or on the physical environment.</p>
<p>Wherever an impact can be eliminated by dropping the activity that
causes it, this is therefore the best—indeed the only truly
good-solution.</p>
<p>Managerial authority over, and control of, work-community affairs is
perhaps the one area where this can be done—and with direct benefit to
institution and management them- selves.</p>
<p>In most cases the activity cannot, however, be eliminated. Hence
there is need for sys- tematic work at eliminating the impact—or at
least at minimizing it—while maintaining the underlying activity
itself.</p>
<p>The ideal approach is to make the elimination of impacts into a
profitable business opportunity. One example is the way Dow Chemical,
one of the leading U.S. chemical companies, has for almost twenty years
tackled air and water pollution. Dow decided, shortly after World War
II, that air and water pollution was an undesirable impact that had to
be eliminated. Long before the public outcry about the environment, Dow
adopted a zero pollution policy for its plants. It then set about
systematically to develop the pollut- ing substances it removes from
smokestack gases and watery effluents into salable prod- ucts and to
create uses and markets for them.</p>
<p>A variant is the Du Pont Industrial Toxicity Laboratory. Du Pont, in
the 1920s, be- came aware of the toxic side effects of many of its
industrial products, set up a laboratory to test for toxicity and to
develop processes to eliminate the poisons. Du Pont started out to
eliminate an impact which at that time every other chemical manufacturer
took for granted. But then Du Pont decided to develop toxicity control
of industrial products into a separate business. The Industrial Toxicity
Laboratory works not only for Du Pont but for a wide variety of
customers for whom it develops nonpoisonous compounds, whose prod- ucts
it tests for toxicity, and so on. Again, an impact has been eliminated
by making it into a business opportunity.</p>
<p>When Regulation is Needed</p>
<p>To make elimination of an impact into a business opportunity shou1d
always be at- tempted. But it cannot be done in many cases. More often
eliminating an impact means increasing the costs. What was an
“externality” for which the general public paid becomes business cost.
It therefore becomes a competitive disadvantage unless everybody in the
industry accepts the same rule. And this, in most cases, can be done
only by regulation— that means by same form of public action.</p>
<p>Whenever an impact cannot be eliminated without an increase in cost,
it becomes in- cumbent upon management to think ahead and work out the
regulation which is most likely to solve the problem at the minimum cost
and with the greatest benefit to public and business alike. And it is
then management’s job to work at getting the right regulation
enacted.</p>
<p>Management—and not only business management—has shunned this
responsibility.</p>
<p>The traditional attitude has always been that “no regulation is the
best regulation.” But this applies only when an impact can be made into
a business opportunity. Where elimina- tion of an impact requires a
restriction, regulation is in the interest of business, and espe- cially
in the interest of responsible business. Otherwise it will be penalized
as “irresponsi-</p>
<p>ble,” while the unscrupulous, the greedy, the stupid, and the
chiseler cash in. And to ex- pect that there will be no regulation is
willful blindness.</p>
<p>Whenever there bas been the kind of crisis which the automobile
industry ran into with respect to automotive safety or the public
utilities with respect to air pollution, the penalty imposed on business
in the end has been high. Such a crisis always leads to a scandal. It
leads to governmental inquisition, to angry editorials, and eventually
to loss of confidence in an entire industry, its management, and its
products by broad sectors of the public. Finally, there is punitive
legislation.</p>
<p>The fact that the public today sees no issue is not relevant. Indeed
it is not even rele- vant that the public today—as it did in every
single one of the examples above—resists actively any attempts on the
part of farsighted business leaders to prevent a crisis. In the end,
there is the scandal.</p>
<p>One example is the failure of the international petroleum companies
to think ahead and develop the successor to the “petroleum concession,”
the impacts of which could clearly be anticipated at the end of World
War II. Another example is the failure of U.S. industry to think through
the regulation of foreign investment which Canada might adopt to
preserve both political identity and access to capital (for both
examples, see Chapter 59).</p>
<p>The American pharmaceutical industry knew, as early as 1955, that the
existing rules and procedures to test new drugs were not working. They
had been written long before the arrival of the modern potent wonder
drugs and their—equally potent—side effects. Yet any pharmaceutical
company that tried to get the industry to face up to the problem was
shushed by the other members of the club. “Don’t rock the boat,” the
prospective innovator was told. One company, it is reported, actually
worked up a comprehensive new approach and new regulatory procedures. It
was prevailed upon to bury them in its ar- chives.</p>
<p>And then came the Thalidomide scandal. It actually proved the
effectiveness of the American control system; for while Thalidomide was
approved for medical practice in the European countries; the U.S.
regulatory authorities became concerned very early about the drug’s
toxic side effects and withheld approval. As a result there are no
deformed Thalidomide babies in the U.S. as there are in Germany, Sweden,
and England. Still, the scandal released an enormous tidal wave of
anxiety about drug testing and drug safety in the U.S. And because
industry had not faced up to the problem and had not thought through and
agitated for the right solution, Congress panicked into passing
legislation that threatens seriously to impair the development and
market introduction of new medi- cines—and yet, paradoxically, would
probably not prevent another Thalidomide.</p>
<p>Yet business does not seem to learn the lesson. Business will only
have itself to blame if legislation impairs or undermines the private
pension system in the U.S. Since the 1940s, when pension plans first
came into wide use in American business, managements have known that
most pension plans have two major undesirable impacts. First they pe-
nalize an employee who moves to another employer, even if the move is
involuntary and the result of being laid off. Second, they do not
protect the employee in the event of bank- ruptcy and liquidation of his
employer, or at least not in the majority of private pension plans. It
would have been relatively easy and cheap to take care of these two side
effects. But it would have been unpopular to raise the issues,
especially in the unionized com- pany. Management therefore evaded the
problem. As a result, the pension system of American business is in
danger of being restricted, if not legislated out of existence. And the
costs of pensions to the employing business will, in all likelihood, go
up sharply, way beyond what would have been needed to give the employees
the protection they need.</p>
<p>The Trade-Offs</p>
<p>Any solution to an impact problem requires trade-offs. Beyond a
certain level elimination of an impact costs more in money or in energy,
in resources or in lives, than the attainable benefit. A decision has to
be made on the optimal balance between costs and benefits.</p>
<p>This is something people in an industry understand, as a rule. But no
one outside does— and so the outsider’s solution tends to ignore the
trade-off problem altogether.</p>
<p>Where is the trade-off between the overdue concern for a natural
environment threat- ened by the strip-mining of coal and the lives saved
in switching from underground min- ing to strip-mining? Underground
mining can never be truly safe. It will also always re- main a health
hazard because of the coal dust and the contaminated air in which under-
ground work has to be performed. Strip-mining, on the other hand, should
be a fairly safe occupation and has few health hazards. But where is the
trade-off between lives and natu- ral beauty and clean, unpolluted
streams?</p>
<p>But there is, in the strip-mining issue, also a trade-off between the
costs of environ- mental damage and the cost in jobs, living standards,
and in the health hazard of cold homes and the safety hazards of dark
streets implicit in dear and scarce energy.</p>
<p>What happens if management fails to face up to an impact and to think
through the trade-off is illustrated by the American experience with the
control of automotive emis- sions.</p>
<p>That such controls would be needed has been known since the end of
World War II when smog first became a household word in Los Angeles. The
automobile industry, however, relied on public relations, which told it
that the public was not concerned about smog. Then, suddenly, in the
sixties, the public panicked and forced through drastic emis-
sion-control legislation. Whether the new controls will actually cut
pollution is quite doubtful. They control emissions in new cars, but are
unlikely to control emissions in the great majority of cars on the road,
which are more than two to three years old. One thing is, however,
certain. These emission controls will themselves cause substantial new
pollu- tion. They greatly increase the energy needed to drive the car
and will therefore have to use more gasoline. This will require more
petroleum refining—one of the most polluting of industrial activities.
At the same time, they will add very substantially to the cost of the
car and of automotive service. What the right trade-offs would have been
we do not know—for industry did not do its work. But both industry and
public will pay and suffer.</p>
<p>The public welcomes an intelligent solution for such a problem if
management presses for one before the scandal. This has been the
experience of the Committee for Economic Development (CED) in its twenty
years of existence, and of any other business or industry group which
took responsibility for an impact and brought to bear on it the
knowledge, competence, and seriousness of its best people.</p>
<p>Most managers know this. And yet, they hope against hope that the
problem will go away. They postpone thinking about it, let alone taking
action. At the most they make speeches. And they fight a rearguard
action after they have lost.</p>
<p>Responsibility for social impacts is a management responsibility—not
because it is a social responsibility, but because it is a business
responsibility. The ideal is to make elimination of such an impact into
a business opportunity. But wherever that cannot be done, the design of
the appropriate regulation with the optimal trade-off balance—and public
discussion of the problem and promotion of the best regulatory
solution—is man- agement’s job.</p>
<p>Social Problems as Business Opportunities</p>
<p>Social problems are dysfunctions of society and—at least
potentially—degenerative dis- eases of the body politic. They are ills.
But for the management of institutions, and, above all, for business
management they represent challenges. They are major sources of oppor-
tunity. For it is the function of business—and to a lesser degree of the
other main institu- tions—to satisfy a social need and at the same time
serve their institution, by making reso- lution of a social problem into
a business opportunity.</p>
<p>It is the job of business to convert change into innovation, that is,
into new business.</p>
<p>And it is a poor businessman who thinks that innovation refers to
technology alone. Social change and social innovation have throughout
business history been at least as important as technology. After all,
the major industries of the nineteenth century were, to a very</p>
<p>large extent, the result of converting the new social environment—the
industrial city— into a business opportunity and into a business market.
This underlay the rise of lighting, first by gas and then by
electricity, of the streetcar and the interurban trolley, of telephone,
newspaper, and department store—to name only a few.</p>
<p>The most significant opportunities for converting social problems
into business oppor- tunities may therefore not be in new technologies,
new products, and new services. They may be in solving the social
problem, that is, in social innovation which then directly and
indirectly benefits and strengthens the company, or the industry.</p>
<p>The success of some of the most successful businesses is largely the
result of such so- cial innovation. Here are some American examples:</p>
<p>Julius Rosenwald, the “city slicker” who built Sears, Roebuck,
invented and for many years financed the Country Farm Agent. The social
problem he identified was the poverty, ignorance, and isolation of the
American farmer who still, in the early years of this cen- tury,
constituted half the U.S. population. Knowledge to enable the farmer to
produce more, to produce the right things, and to get more for his
efforts was available. But it was inaccessible to the farmer. The County
Farm Agent—rather than new technology, new machines, or new seeds—became
a main force behind the “productivity explosion” on the American farm.
Rosenwald saw a genuine social problem. But he also saw a genuine
business opportunity. For the farmer’s poverty, ignorance, and isolation
were major ob- stacles to Sears. As the farmer’s position and income
grew, so did the Sears market. And Sears came to be identified by the
farmers as the “farmer’s friend.”</p>
<p>Tackling a social problem as a business opportunity also played a
substantial part in the meteoric rise of Ford in its early days.</p>
<p>The years immediately, prior to World War I were years of great labor
unrest in the United States, growing labor bitterness, and high
unemployment. Hourly wages for skilled men ran as low as 15 cents in
many cases. It was against this background that the Ford Motor Company,
in the closing days of 1913, announced that it would pay a guaranteed
-a-day wage to every one of its workers—two to three times what was then
standard. James Couzens, the company’s general manager, who had forced
this decision on his re- luctant partner Henry Ford, knew perfectly well
that his company’s wage bill would al- most triple overnight. But he
became convinced that the workmen’s sufferings were so great that only
radical and highly visible action could have an effect. Couzens also ex-
pected that Ford’s actual labor cost, despite the tripling of the wage
rate, would go down—and events soon proved him right. Before Ford
changed the whole labor economy of the United States with one
announcement, labor turnover at the Ford Motor Company had been so high
that, in 1912, 60,000 men had to be hired to retain 10,000 workers. With
the new wage, turnover almost disappeared. The resulting savings were so
great that de- spite sharply rising costs for all materials in the next
few years, Ford could produce and sell its Model T at a lower price and
yet make a larger profit per car. It was the saving in labor cost
produced by a drastically, higher wage that gave Ford market domination.
At the same time Ford’s action transformed American industrial society.
It established the American workingman as fundamentally middle
class.</p>
<p>IBM also owes its rise largely, to a frontal attack on a social
problem. During the years of the Great Depression IBM was a very small
company and had little visibility. Hence its action had none of the
impact of Ford’s -a-day wage twenty years earlier. Yet in giving workers
employment security and then putting them on a salary instead of an
hourly wage (as related in Chapter 20) IBM was as bold and innovative as
Ford had been. IBM’s action too was aimed at a major social problem of
the time, the fear, insecurity, and loss of dignity that the Depression
inflicted on workers in America. It too turned a social disease into a
business opportunity. It was this action, above all, which created the
human potential for IBM’s rapid growth and, then, a decade later, for
its aggressive move into the totally new computer technology.</p>
<p>And here is a European example. The growth of Olivetti into one of
the world’s lead- ing producers of office equipment rests on two
insights of the late Adriano Olivetti, who, in the 1920s, inherited a
small, unknown, and barely viable family company in the small</p>
<p>town of Ivrea in northern Italy. Adriano Olivetti saw the opportunity
to give his company and his products distinction through good design.
Olivetti’s design gave him market rec- ognition within a decade. He also
saw in Italy’s corrosive class hatred an opportunity. The community in
which he tried to fuse management and worker in Ivrea gave him excep-
tional labor productivity, high-quality production, and a work force
willing to accept new technology and changes—and with it competitive
strength and profitability.</p>
<p>In present-day society one area where a serious problem might be
solved by making it into an opportunity could well be the fatigue,
frustration, and “burning-out” of the middle- aged knowledge worker and
his need for a second career.* The hidden cost of the middle- aged
knowledge workers—managers and knowledge professionals—who have “retired
on the job,” have lost interest, and just go through the motions, may
well be larger than that of Ford’s labor turnover in 1913. At the same
time, the frustrations and silent despair of these men and women may
pose as great a social danger to society as the misery, bitter- ness,
and despair of the suffering manual worker of yesterday. Nothing is as
corrosive as success turned into frustration. The first company which
tackles this problem as both a social problem and an opportunity might
well reap benefits fully as great as those reaped by Ford sixty years
ago and Olivetti and IBM forty years ago.</p>
<p>To cure social ills by making them into opportunities for
contribution and perform- ance is by no means a challenge to business
enterprise alone. It is the responsibility as well of all the other
institutions of our society of organizations.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of talk today about the crisis of the
university; and the crisis is real. In some places, however, it has been
seized as an opportunity. In Great Britain there is the Open University,
which uses television to make university education available to anyone
who is willing to do the work. In California the medium-sized and
little-known University of the Pacific, in Stockton, is building a new
kind of university. It utilizes the desire of young people to learn but
also to be responsible participants in their learning.</p>
<p>Rosenwald, Ford, IBM’s Watson, and Olivetti were all initially
ridiculed as visionar- ies. No one could solve the problems they
tackled, they were told. Ten or fifteen years later, their solutions
were dismissed as “obvious.” The right solution is always obvious in
retrospect. What matters is that these men and their companies
identified a major social problem and asked, “How can it be solved as a
business opportunity?”</p>
<p>Any business, and indeed any institution, needs to organize
innovative efforts to con- vert social problems into opportunities for
performance and contribution.</p>
<p>In the last quarter century organized technological research has
become common- place. Social innovation is still largely left to chance
and to the individual entrepreneur who stumbles upon an opportunity.
This is no longer adequate. In the society of organiza- tions, every
institution needs to organize its RandandandandD for society and
community fully as much as it had been organizing it for technology.
Management has to organize to identify the issues, the crises, the
problems in society and community, and to work at the innova- tions that
will make their solution into a profitable opportunity.</p>
<p>The “Degenerative Diseases” of Society</p>
<p>Social problems that management action converts into opportunities
soon cease to be problems. The others, however, are likely to become
“chronic complaints,” if not “degen- erative diseases.”</p>
<p>Not every social problem can be resolved by making it into an
opportunity for contri- bution and performance. Indeed, the most serious
of such problems tend to defy this ap- proach.</p>
<p>No business could, for instance, have done much about America’s most
serious de- generative disease throughout our history—the racial
problem. It could not even be tack- led until the whole society had
changed awareness and convictions—by which time it was very late, if not
altogether too late. And even if one management solves such a
problem,</p>
<p>*On this see my book, The Age of Discontinuity, especially Chapter
13.</p>
<p>the rest may not follow. There may be a solution; but while known and
visible, it is not being used. The problem stays acute and
unresolved.</p>
<p>American business had to follow Ford’s lead between 1914 and
1920—though the la- bor shortage of World War I had as much to do with
this as Ford’s example. But few American companies imitated IBM and even
fewer Italian companies imitated Olivetti, despite their visible
success.</p>
<p>What then is the social responsibility of management for these social
problems that become chronic or degenerative diseases?</p>
<p>They are management’s problems. The health of the enterprise is
management’s re- sponsibility. A healthy business and a sick society are
hardly compatible. Healthy busi- nesses require a healthy, or at least a
functioning, society. The health of the community is a prerequisite for
successful and growing business.</p>
<p>And it is foolish to hope that these problems will disappear if only
one looks the other way. Problems go away because someone does something
about them.</p>
<p>With any such problem, management had better find out whether someone
has, in fact, done something that works. That few, if any, U.S.
businesses have followed IBM, few Italian businesses have followed
Olivetti, and few German businesses have followed Zeiss is management
failure. It is basically not too different from the management failure
to keep technology and products competitive. And the reasons are not too
different either; they are shortsightedness, indolence, and
incompetence.</p>
<p>Yet there remain the big, tough, dangerous dysfunctions of society,
the social prob- lems for which no one has worked out a solution, and
which cannot, it seems, be resolved, or perhaps not even assuaged, by
being made performance opportunities.</p>
<p>To what extent should business—or any other of the special-purpose
institutions of our society—be expected to tackle such a problem which
did not arise out of an impact of theirs and which cannot be converted
into an opportunity for performance of the institu- tion’s purpose and
mission? To what extent should these institutions, business, university,
or hospital, even be permitted to take responsibility?</p>
<p>Today’s rhetoric tends to ignore that question. “Here is,” Mayor
Lindsay of New York says, “the Black ghetto. No one knows what to do
with it. Whatever government, social workers, or community action try,
things seem only to get worse. Therefore big business better take
responsibility.”</p>
<p>That Mayor Lindsay frantically looks for someone to take over is
understandable and the problem that is defeating him is indeed desperate
and a major threat to his city, to American society, and to the Western
world altogether. But is it enough to make the prob- lem of the Black
ghetto the social responsibility of management? Or are there limits to
social responsibility? And what are they?</p>
