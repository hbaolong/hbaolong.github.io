<h4 id="needed-an-effective-board">52 Needed: An Effective Board</h4>
<p>The Board: Legal Fiction and Impotent Reality—The Push to
“Politicize” the Board—The Board in Germany, Sweden, and the U.S. —The
“Euroboard” —Why Top Management Needs a Board—The Three Functions of the
Board—The Board as Review and Appeals Organ—The Board as Safeguard
Against Incompetent Manage- ment—The Public and Community Relations
Function—What Is Needed—Objectives and a “Work Plan” for the Board—Who
Belongs on the Board—The “Professional” Director—Designing and Building
an Effective Board as a Top-Management Task</p>
<p>D</p>
<p>IFFERENT COUNTRIES HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES for the organ that super-
vises top management, counsels it, reviews its decisions, and appoints
men into top- management positions—board of directors, supervisory
board, and conseil d’administration. Different countries provide for
different membership.</p>
<p>Members of management, for instance, cannot sit on the German
supervisory board but are permitted to do so under American, British,
and Japanese law. In France the top- management function is conceived as
delegated by the board of directors to one or several of its members so
that board membership is almost obligatory for membership in top
management. And there are other variants. Outside of countries of the
German-type com- pany law, where this is forbidden, it is not uncommon
to find boards in which member- ship is restricted to full-time members
of management. In Japan, for instance, the board is usually another name
for the top-management committee. In Great Britain there is a dis-
tinction between “executive” members of the board, that is,
top-management people, and “non-executive” members, that is, outsiders
who hold no official position in the company.</p>
<p>But there is one thing all boards have in common, regardless of their
legal position.</p>
<p>They do not function. The decline of the board is a universal
phenomenon of this century. Perhaps nothing shows it as clearly as that
the board, which, in law, is the governing or- gan of a corporation, was
always the last group to hear of trouble in the great business
catastrophes of this century.</p>
<p>This happened in the collapse of the Austrian Credit Anstalt, the
leading Austrian bank, which in 1931 triggered the first worldwide
monetary crisis and, within a few weeks, brought down the English pound.
It was equally true in the big German business failures of the early
thirties which led to the collapse of the German banking system and
which had a good deal to do with Hitler’s ascent to power. It was true
in the business col- lapses of the post-World War II period—Rolls-Royce
in England, the Penn-Central Rail- road in the United States, and the
catastrophic decline of Italy’s leading chemical com- pany, Monticatini,
in the mid-sixties. Only at the very last minute, if even then, did the
boards of these companies find out that things were not going well.</p>
<p>Whenever one of the “scandals” breaks, the board’s failure is blamed
on stupidity, negligence of board members, or on failure of management
to keep its board informed. But when such malfunction occurs with
unfailing regularity, one must conclude that it is the institution that
fails to perform rather than individuals.</p>
<p>The board, whatever its name and whatever its legal structure, has
become a fiction.</p>
<p>The law may still treat it as the sovereign organ of the
corporation—but, then, English legal rhetoric still treats the Queen as
an Absolute Monarch whose every whim is a com- mand. The reality,
however, is that boards are either simply management committees, or they
are ineffectual. Rather than decry the failure of individuals, we
therefore better ask “Why have boards, regardless of their legal
structure, lost their capacity to perform?”</p>
<p>In Georg Siemens’s day they apparently did perform. In fact, their
performance could be taken for granted—as it was by Siemens, who himself
served on quite a few boards and who, at the same time, worked closely
with the board of his own bank and treated it as an integral part of his
own top management.</p>
<p>One reason for the malfunction of the board is, of course, the
development of the large publicly held corporation. The original board,
whether American, English, French, or German, was conceived as
representing the owners. This was reality in the nineteenth century when
stock ownership, by and large, was concentrated among a few people or a
few groups, each holding a substantial share of the total. Each board
member had a siz- able stake in the enterprise. Each was able to devote
a good deal of time and attention to the company. Each sat on only a few
boards.</p>
<p>But large companies in advanced countries are no longer owned by a
small group.</p>
<p>Their legal ownership is held by many thousands of “investors.” The
boards no longer represent the owner, or indeed anyone in particular. As
a result, board membership has lost its rationale. People are invited to
sit on boards because of their name. Or worse, board members are
recruited from people who do business with a company, such as the
company’s bankers or the company’s lawyers. Above all, board members are
being re- cruited from among successful corporate executives—and in
return for the president of Company A accepting board membership at
Company B, the president of Company B accepts board membership at
Company A. These busy people do not have a large enough stake in the
company to justify their spending much time on it. Or, if they are doing
busi- ness with the company, they are understandably reluctant to probe
into its affairs, to ask inconvenient questions, or to appear critical.
They go through the motions. And they are likely to sit on so many
boards that they cannot really do their homework.</p>
<p>Another reason is that the board cannot be what the law in most
countries (other than those that followed the German law, e.g., Austria
and Switzerland) says it is. It cannot be the governing body of the
company. That is a full-time job. To try to do it on a part-time basis
means that only trivia will even be looked at, let alone discussed.</p>
<p>A final factor in the steady decline of the board has surely been
that top management, by and large, does not want a really effective
board. An effective board demands top- management performance and
removes top executives who do not perform adequately— this is its duty.
An effective board asks inconvenient questions. An effective board
insists on being informed before the event—this is its legal
responsibility. An effective board will not unquestioningly accept the
recommendations of top management but will want to know why. It will not
rubber-stamp the personnel decisions of top management but will want to
know, indeed to get personally acquainted with, alternative candidates
for senior appointments. An effective board, in other words, insists on
being effective. And this, to most top managements, appears to be a
restraint, a limitation, an interference with “man- agement
prerogatives,” and altogether a threat.</p>
<p>Why Top Management Needs an Effective Board</p>
<p>Many top managements will argue that there is nothing wrong with the
decline of the board. They are perfectly content to see the board become
a legal fiction. Indeed they would be perfectly willing to see the board
disappear altogether (and where the board is completely an “inside”
board, that is, controlled entirely by members of top management, the
board as such has disappeared).</p>
<p>But this is exceedingly short sighted. It is becoming increasingly
clear that top man- agement will not—and in the large corporation must
not—be permitted to operate without</p>
<p>an effective and strong board. The alternative to top management’s
developing an effec- tive board for its own needs and those of the
enterprise, is the imposition by society of the wrong kind of board,
especially on the large corporation. Such an imposed board will attempt
to control top management and to dictate direction and decision. It will
indeed become the “boss.” It must consider itself an adversary of top
management. It will not, indeed, cannot, act in the interest of the
enterprise. The first signs of this are clearly around us—indeed, it may
already be too late to reverse the trend.</p>
<p>The malfunction of the board first became apparent in the Germany of
the Weimar Republic. And it is Germany also where the first outside
control has been imposed on the boards of large companies, in the form
of “co-determination,” that is, of legally required worker
representation on the board, first for companies in the coal and stee1
industries and then for all large businesses. Of course, no worker
representative sits on German company boards; the members are trade
union officials. But this does not alter the fact that the large-company
board in Germany today has become a battleground for contend- ing
factions.</p>
<p>A different development, but one pointing in the same direction, is
under way in Swe- den, where government now appoints members to boards
of the major banks. So far, peo- ple of stature and known integrity have
been selected by and large. But once there are political appointees on
the boards of individual companies, politics cannot be kept out of such
appointments for very long. As soon as this happens, the board ceases to
be able to work effectively as the review organ, the confidant, the
advisor, and guide of top man- agement. It becomes a regulator, an
adversary. (Sweden, since 1972, also requires that employee
representatives be elected to the boards of large companies, including
banks.)</p>
<p>The proposed statutes for the “European” company combine the German
and the Swedish approaches and call for boards controlled by government
and employee repre- sentatives.</p>
<p>In, the United States in the last few years there has been mounting
pressure to make boards “relevant,” that is, to appoint as board members
representatives of all kinds of groups: Blacks, women, the poor, and so
on. These appointees, no matter how distin- guished the individual,
cannot function as board members. Their role is to represent this or
that outside group, this or that special interest. Their role must be to
make demands on top management and to push special projects, special
needs, and special policies. They cannot be concerned with, or
responsible for, the enterprise. Nor should they be expected to hold in
confidence what they hear at board meetings; in fact their trust is not
to the en- terprise but to their constituents outside.</p>
<p>These developments demonstrate that society will not allow top
management, and es- pecially top management of large and visible
businesses, to exercise its power without an appropriate and effective
board. The board, as it has been conceived originally—well over a
century ago—has indeed outlived its usefulness. This, however, makes it
an urgent top-management job to think through what kind of a board the
enterprise and its top man- agement need. The decay of the traditional
board has created a vacuum. It will not remain unfilled.</p>
<p>The Three Functions of the Board</p>
<p>There are actually three different tasks for which a company, and
especially a large one, needs a functioning board.</p>
<p>The big company is too important to society not to have a “control”
in its own struc- ture. Somebody has to make sure that top management
thinks through what the company’s</p>
<p>business is and what it should be. Somebody has to make sure that
objectives are being set and strategies are being developed. Somebody
has to look critically at the planning of the company, its
capital-investment policy, and its managed-expenditures budget. Some-
body has to monitor people decisions and organization problems and has
to be the “su- preme court.” Somebody has to watch the organization’s
spirit , has to make sure that it succeeds in utilizing the strengths of
people and in neutralizing their weaknesses, that it develops tomorrow’s
managers and that its rewards to managers, its management tools and
management methods strengthen the organization and direct it toward
objectives.</p>
<p>Without such an organ of review, top managernent has no way to
control itself. It has no true legitimacy. But management also needs
someone to talk to. Everybody within a company always wants something
from top management. And no outsider knows enough about the company, its
business and its people.</p>
<p>To have someone to talk to is, above all, a top-management need in
the small com- pany where top management otherwise tends to be isolated.
Small company manage- ments, without easy, continuous access to outside
advisors such as experienced lawyers and consultants, need to have
available to them a few people who are experienced, who can understand
the business, and who are not yet part of it. Small-company top manage-
ments need, therefore, a true board of directors—yet small companies, as
a rule, have even less of a functioning board than the large ones.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>An effective and functioning board is needed to remove a top
management that fails to perform. A board capable of removing
incompetent or nonperforming top manage- ments has, of course, real
power. But only a weak top management is afraid of it. And no</li>
</ol>
<p>society can tolerate top-management incompetence in its large
businesses. If top man- agements do not build boards that will remove a
weak and incompetent chief executives, government will take over the
job.</p>
<p>There is another alternative: the “takeover” by the “financial
raider.” Management ex- perts and economists have been telling us for a
long time that the top managements of large publicly held companies have
become immune to stockholder control and that only coronary thrombosis
or bankruptcy can dislodge a top management once it has established
itself. This no longer holds.* Top managements—most of them seemingly
all-powerful, seemingly deeply entrenched, seemingly in complete
control—have been toppled by stockholder revolts organized by the
financial raiders and their “takeover bids.” The raid- ers did not aim
at companies in trouble. They aimed in the main at companies that did
not live up to their potential, companies the top managements of which
did not perform ade- quately.</p>
<p>Unless top management builds into the company’s structure an
effective organ for its removal in case of nonperformance, the raider
and his takeover bid will become an ever- present threat. A jackal is
better than no scavenger.</p>
<p>Top executives are paid for performance. Their compensation is high
because it in- cludes a “risk premium.” In any large company, especially
where ownership is so widely diffused that there is no controlling
interest, it is the duty of the board to review top- management
performance regularly and in depth, and to remove top executives who do
not measure up to very high demands. And this requires both a board
familiar with the company, and a strong board.</p>
<p>*For an analysis of the “takeover wave” and its meaning, see the
essay “The New Markets and the New Entre- preneurs” in my book, Men,
Ideas and Politics; English title The New Markets.</p>
<p>The central fact is that the modern enterprise has a multiplicity of
constituencies. The shareholders are one. But they are no longer the
one, as traditional legal theory has it. Instead of being “owners” they
have become “investors.” The employees are clearly also such a
constituency, but they are not, as the German trade unions (or the
“industrial com- munity” laws in various Latin-American countries)
assert, the constituency. There are also the communities where a major
company has its plants. There are consumers, suppliers, and
distributors. All of them need to know what goes on in a major business
what its problems, its policies, and its plans are. The business needs
to be understood by them. Top management needs to be known by them,
respected by them, accepted by them. Top management needs even more,
perhaps, to understand what these constituencies want, understand,
misunderstand, see, question.</p>
<p>Big companies are spending enormous sums on public relations. Yet the
evidence is clear that they fail to make themselves understood by their
publics and, worse, that they fail to understand their publics. Public
relations as top-management press-agentry has failed. But this makes all
the more important genuine public and community relations, aimed at
understanding the public rather than at making it “love” a company and
its top management. This requires that top management have access to,
and can work with, peo- ple from these publics and constituencies whom
it respects, but who are independent— people who, in turn, respect top
management and know what it is trying to do. This means a public and
community relations board that is built into the enterprise’s structure
and functions as an integral organ of top management.</p>
<p>The German trade unionist or the American consumer advocate has a
point when he pushes for board representation for his constituency. He
is wrong only in believing that his constituency is the constituency; it
is one of many.</p>
<p>The governing board of directors must be a board that represents no
one except the basic long-term interests of the enterprise. It must be
capable of discharging its function as the review organ and as the
supervisor of top-management performance.</p>
<p>But the enterprise also needs a board that is, in effect, an organ of
information, advice, consultation, and communication—that is, the public
and community relations board. If the enterprise and its top management
do not create this board, it will be imposed on them in wrong and
harmful form, that is, as an organ of antagonism, control, and
restraint— which is what worker representation on the German board,
government representation on the Swedish board, and minority-group
representation on the American board are. That this will further
undermine the board may be a minor matter. It will, however, also un-
dermine the authority of company and top management, impair their
integrity, and reduce their capacity to perform.</p>
<p>What Is Needed</p>
<p>Clearly, two different organs are needed. One is the executive board
which gives top management somebody to talk to, a review organ, a
conscience, a counselor, an advisor— but also an informed and prepared
“stand-by” in case there is “power failure,” that is, failure of a
company’s top management or need to find successors to today’s top man-
agement.</p>
<p>The other organ is the public and community relations board which
gives a company, and especially a large one, access to its various
publics.</p>
<p>There is no reason why these two could not legally be one body. But
they have to op- erate differently. With its public and community
relations board, top management needs to discuss what the various
publics want, need to know, and need to understand. With its executive
board top management needs to discuss what top management itself needs
to discuss, what top management itself needs to think through, needs to
decide, needs to understand. One way to satisfy the need for two boards
is to have the executive board operate as a special committee—an
executive committee—of a big board.</p>
<p>There are effective boards in existence. None so far fulfills
adequately all three of the board’s functions. Even so, however, they
demonstrate the importance of an effective board and the contribution it
can make.</p>
<p>One example is the small but exceedingly effective boards of the
Wallenberg Compa- nies, affiliated with Stockholm’s Enskilda Bank in
Sweden. Marcus Wallenberg, who led the Enskilda Bank in the period after
World War II, insisted on clear definition of top management’s place and
functions in the companies in which the bank played a leading role. This
then enabled him to build strong boards, which made a major contribution
to the affairs of each company. The tremendous economic growth of
Sweden—and espe- cially of the Wallenberg Companies—in the post-World
War II period, is in no small measure the result of Wallenberg’s
insistence on an effective board based on a clear defi- nition of the
top-management job.</p>
<p>Another example is the rise of Merck andandandand Company, a small
and fairly obscure drug house before World War II, to leadership in the
American pharmaceutical industry. In large part this was brought about
by one member of the board of directors, Vannevar Bush. Bush, who had
been a distinguished scientist at M.I.T. and then chief scientific ad-
ministrator in America’s World War II effort, joined the Merck board as
a part-time chairman with the specific assignment to think through what
the top management of the company should be and should do. One of his
conclusions was the need for an effective board which could both review
and guide top management, and could create access for it to major
publics such as the scientific community. And this, in turn, led to a
long-range strategy for Merck which, within a decade, gave a company
that had started far behind the old pros in its industry worldwide
leadership in an extremely competitive industry.</p>
<p>What is needed for an effective board is first careful thinking
through of the top- management function and of the function and work of
the board. It requires objectives and a work plan for the board. Unless
the board is set up to discharge specific functions with clear
objectives, it will not perform.</p>
<p>Who Belongs on a Board?</p>
<p>This requires thinking through who belongs on the board. Some of the
people who today are being put on boards—e.g., the company’s bankers and
underwriters—belong on the public and community relations board. The
financial community is a constituent. Man- agement needs to have access
to it, be understood by it, and understand it. But very few other people
who today sit on boards should be considered eligible for membership on
either the public and community relations board or the review and
appeals board.</p>
<p>Neither, for instance, should contain former company officers who
have retired. It will be argued that to exclude former senior managers
from board membership is to deprive the company of a great deal of
knowledge and wisdom. But the right way to keep avail- able to a
management the knowledge and wisdom of one of its retired elder
statesmen is the Japanese practice of retaining such a man as a
“counselor.” Similarly, no one who sells anything to the company,
whether goods or services, such as suppliers, lawyers, or consultants,
should be a member of the board.</p>
<p>Who, then, should be a board member? So far we can answer this
question only for membership on the review and appeals board.</p>
<p>The first requirement, is competence. Board members should have
proven their ability as senior executives—whether in a business, in
government service, or in other institu- tions. Ideally, the board
member of the future will be in his (or her) mid-fifties and willing to
step out of operating to become an advisor, a guide, a conscience.</p>
<p>Second, board members should have time for the job. In fact, no one
can really do the job well if he sits on more than a small number of
boards—maybe four or five at the most.</p>
<p>Georg Siemens, a century ago, knew this. He limited himself to a few
boards and promptly stepped down when he considered that he had
accomplished the mission for which he had originally joined a board. His
successors, however, forgot this—one of the more recent chief executives
of Deutsche Bank sat on well above a hundred boards. No</p>
<p>matter how brilliant and how well supported by a secretariat, no man
can possibly do his homework sitting on more than four or five
boards.</p>
<p>This then clearly means that the effective board member has to be a
“professional di- rector.” Indeed, board membership should be recognized
as a full-time profession for a really first rate man. And it should be
paid as such, i.e., by a fee and not by stock options or a share in the
profits.</p>
<p>Finally, board members should be independent of management. This
probably implies election for a limited period of years after which a
man would not be eligible for re- election. If a man knows that he will
not be re-elected after five years, no matter how well he gets along
with the management whom he serves as a board member, he is unlikely to
find it necessary to be subservient. At the same time, board members
should be elected for definite periods and should have reasonable
security of tenure during that period.</p>
<p>How to build the communications and community relations board we do
not yet know.</p>
<p>But it is just as urgent. Politically—as witness the German, Swedish,
American, and “Euroboard” developments—it may be more urgent. Surely the
traditional attitude of management, i.e., to resist any development that
would introduce the public and commu- nity relations function into the
board can no longer be maintained. However, justified it may have been,
it will not work any longer.</p>
<p>The choice is no longer between having a non-board, which is what we
are having to- day, by and large, and an effective board. It is between
a board imposed on enterprise and both hostile and inappropriate to it
and a board that is an effective organ of the enterprise and appropriate
to its needs.</p>
