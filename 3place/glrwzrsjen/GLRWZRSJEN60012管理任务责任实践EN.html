<h4 id="preface">Preface:</h4>
<p>The Alternative to Tyranny</p>
<p>It is fashionable today to talk of a revolt against authority and to
proclaim that everybody should “do his own thing.” This, then, I have to
admit, is a most unfashionable book. It does not talk about rights. It
stresses responsibility. Its focus is not on doing one’s own thing but
on performance.</p>
<p>Our society has become, within an incredibly short fifty years, a
society of institutions.</p>
<p>It has become a pluralist society in which every major social task
has been entrusted to large organizations—from producing economic goods
and services to health care, from social security and welfare to
education, from, the search for new knowledge to the pro- tection of the
natural environment.</p>
<p>It is understandable that the sudden realization of this change in
the crystal structure of society has evoked an angry response, “Down
with organization!” But it is the wrong re- sponse. The alternative to
autonomous institutions that function and perform is not free- dom. It
is totalitarian tyranny.</p>
<p>Our society is neither willing nor able to do without the services
that only the institu- tions can provide. And the most vocal among our
modern Luddites, the would-be institu- tion wreckers, the highly
educated young people, are even less able to do without the large
organizations than the rest of us. For it is only in the large
organizations that there exist plentiful opportunities to make a living
through knowledge, to make a contribution through knowledge, and to
achieve through knowledge.</p>
<p>If the institutions of our pluralist society of institutions do not
perform in responsible autonomy, we will not have individualism and a
society in which there is a chance for people to fulfill themselves. We
will instead impose on ourselves complete regimentation in which no one
will be allowed autonomy. We will have Stalinism rather than participa-
tory democracy, let alone the joyful spontaneity of doing one’s own
thing. Tyranny is the only alternative to strong, performing autonomous
institutions. Tyranny substitutes one absolute boss for the pluralism of
competing institutions. It substitutes terror for responsi- bility. It
does indeed do away with the institutions, but only by submerging all of
them in the one all-embracing bureaucracy of the apparat. It does
produce goods and services, though only fitfully, wastefully, at a low
level, and at an enormous cost in suffering, hu- miliation, and
frustration. To make our institutions perform responsibly, autonomously,
and on a high level of achievement is thus the only safeguard of freedom
and dignity in the pluralist society of institutions.</p>
<p>But it is managers and management that make institutions perform.
Performing, re- sponsible management is the alternative to tyranny and
our only protection against it.</p>
<p>Management is work, and as such it has its own skills, its own tools,
its own techniques. A good many skills, tools, and techniques are
discussed in this book, a few in some detail. But the stress is not on
skills, tools, and techniques. It is not even on the work of man-
agement. It is on the tasks.</p>
<p>For management is the organ, the life-giving, acting, dynamic organ
of the institution it manages. Without the institution, e.g., the
business enterprise, there would be no man- agement. But without
management there would also be only a mob rather than an institu- tion.
The institution, in turn, is itself an organ of society and exists only
to contribute a needed result to society, the economy, and the
individual. Organs, however, are never</p>
<p>defined by what they do, let alone by how they do it. They are
defined by their contribu- tion.</p>
<p>Most books on management are books on the work of management. They
look at management from the inside. This book starts with the tasks. It
looks at management first from the outside and studies the dimensions of
the tasks and the requirements in respect to each of them (Part One).
Only then (in Part Two) does it turn to the work of the organiza- tion
and the skills of management, and (in Part Three) to top management, its
tasks, its structures, and its strategies.</p>
<p>I myself have for many years been deeply interested in the management
sciences, that is, in the manager’s logical and analytical tools. But
there are no equations in this book, no graphs, no mathematical
formulas, not even a table. The stress throughout the book is not on how
to do, let alone on how to make the tools to do it. Even when discussing
skills, even when discussing the management sciences themselves, the
stress is on accomplish- ments and results. This book is task-focused
throughout.</p>
<p>This book is also manager-focused. The starting point was the
question, What does the manager have to know, or at least to understand,
to be equal to his task?</p>
<p>The many, many books on management are skill-focused,
discipline-focused, or func- tion-focused. They deal with one aspect of
a manager’s task. They may deal with manag- ing a business or a hospital
or with managing people, with tools, e.g., controls, or with specific
problems. They deal with the author’s particular area of concern or
expertise, rather than with the tasks of the manager.</p>
<p>This book was designed to be different. It was designed to take as
starting point and as principle that informs the entire work the
manager’s needs rather than the author’s own knowledge or special areas
of interest. This explains what is included and what is left-out.</p>
<p>This is a long book—though I dislike long books. And yet it is not a
comprehensive book, but highly selective. A good many readers, I am
sure, will complain that this or that important topic is not even
mentioned; many more will undoubtedly criticize the author’s decision to
stress one topic while playing down another.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the author’s own judgment and his own preferences played
a part. But I have at least tried to decide what belongs in this book
and how much importance to give to it by an objective set of criteria,
developed as the result of years of working closely with managers on all
levels, with managers in large and small businesses, and with man- agers
in business and in non-business service institutions. What every manager
needs to know has been included in this book. What not every manager
needs to know, however important or interesting, has been excluded, or
at least given only cursory treatment. This explains why such topics as
“Managing Money in the Business” or “From Selling to Mar- keting”—to
name two chapters I had in my first draft—are not to be found in the
book, or why, to give another example, the management sciences are
treated in one short chapter only. It explains, however, why a good deal
of space has been devoted to top management and to the relationships
between structure and strategy—topics that are not commonly considered
in a book on management.</p>
<p>It was not my intention to include every problem any manager might
conceivably have to face. But it was my intention to include those areas
of concern with which all managers can expect to deal and in which all
managers have to be literate regardless of their func- tional
background, the mission and purpose of their institution, or the size of
their organi- zation. And this, then, meant a big book, since the
manager’s job is big, and the manage- ment tasks demanding.</p>
<p>Management, the book maintains throughout, is a discipline, or at
least is capable of be- coming one. It is not just common sense. It is
not just codified experience. It is at least potentially an organized
body of knowledge. This book tries to present the little we know so far.
But it also tries to present the much larger body of our organized
ignorance, that is, the areas in which we know that we need new
knowledge, in which we can define what we need—but in which we do not as
yet possess the knowledge.</p>
<p>Indeed, these areas of organized ignorance are perhaps the core of
this book. For in management we have clearly outgrown the knowledge that
had been painfully amassed in what one might call the Heroic Age of
Management—the fifty years before World War II—by a few men and women
working mostly in isolation and sustained by vision and faith rather
than by public acclaim. It was this knowledge that the management boom
of the twenty-five years between World Was II and 1970 popularized,
disseminated, and made effective over most of the world.</p>
<p>Now we know that even in the areas in which we have a little
knowledge, we do not know enough. There are new tasks in these areas for
which we are not yet equipped with tested, proven approaches and tools.
New areas of challenge and new management prob- lems have arisen, where
we have done little work so far and where we have so far only ignorance
rather than even a modicum of knowledge.</p>
<p>This book attempts to identify and define these areas. But it also
attempts to develop at least first approaches to these areas, to think
through policies, principles and practices to accomplish the new tasks
and to satisfy the new challenges. This book tries to equip the manager
with the understanding, the thinking, the knowledge, and the skills for
today’s and also for tomorrow’s job.</p>
<p>While management is a discipline—that is, an organized body of
knowledge and as such applicable everywhere—it is also “culture.” It is
not value-free science. Management is a social function and embedded in
a culture—a society—a tradition of values, customs, and beliefs, and in
governmental and political systems. Management is—and should be—
culture-conditioned; but, in turn, management and managers shape culture
and society.</p>
<p>From the beginning management was polycentric. Management as a
discipline and management as a practice were tackled from the beginning
by men of many nationalities and races. It was a temporary aberration in
the years of the management boom to forget this and to believe
instead—against all evidence—that management was an American specialty,
if not an American invention. Today it is obvious again that management
is polycentric. The management boom has not Americanized management. It
has left un- touched fundamental national characteristics throughout the
world, such important areas, for instance, as the relationship between
government and business management, the fun- damentals of managing
people, or the structure of top management. There surely is no
“management gap” today between Western Europe or Japan, and the United
States (if there ever was one).</p>
<p>This book is based on my experience, especially as a consultant, and
mainly in Amer- ica, or at least with American businesses and
public-service institutions. I have con- sciously attempted during the
last fifteen years to expand my horizon and to work with managements
outside the United States (especially in Great Britain, Western Europe,
Ja- pan, and Latin America). I have tried to study management outside
the United States as well as inside. While the book still has a strong
American flavor—inevitably so—I have tried to relate managerial tasks,
managerial work, managerial organization, and manage- rial approaches to
culture and society and to present, especially in the examples and
illus- trations, management as worldwide rather than as confined to this
or that country.</p>
<p>I have particularly stressed the Japanese experience—not only because
far too few man- agers in the West understand Japanese management and
organization, but also because an understanding of the often very
different ways in which Japan, the only non-Western de- veloped country,
tackles a common task (e.g., the determination of profitability, the or-
ganization of work and workers, or the making of decisions) may help the
Western man- ager to understand better what he himself is trying to do.*
The basic conviction of this book throughout is that each country’s
managers can and need to learn from the best oth- ers have to offer.</p>
<p>*For this reason I have also included a separate listing of books on
Japanese management in the Bibliography.</p>
<p>Management is tasks. Management is a discipline. But management is
also people. Every achievement of management is the achievement of a
manager. Every failure is a failure of a manager. People manage rather
than “forces” or “facts.” The vision, dedication, and integrity of
managers determine whether there is management or mismanagement.</p>
<p>There are no anecdotes in this book; every illustration or example is
intended to drive home an essential point. But in presenting cases and
examples, I have also tried to make the reader aware of the men, and
especially of the practicing managers, who first tackled major
management jobs: Georg Siemens of the Deutsche Bank, for instance, first
working out a century ago the function and structure of top management;
Theodore N. Vail of the American Telephone Company, a little later,
first thinking through “What is our busi- ness?”; or Thomas Watson, Sr.,
trying—and at the same time not trying—to make his little IBM become
capable of growing into a big company.</p>
<p>But the book always tries to integrate man and task. It tries to deal
with objective and impersonal tasks but also with the human
requirements, skills, and basic attitudes needed to perform these tasks.
“Le style c’est l’homme” may apply to a writer. But in other pur- suits
style tends to be manner rather than substance. There is not much talk
of style in this book. But there is stress on character.</p>
<p>In the last analysis management is practice. Its essence is not
knowing but doing. Its test is not logic but results. Its only authority
is performance. This is therefore not a philosophi- cal book even though
it deals with fundamentals. It grew out of practice. And it centers on
practice.</p>
<p>“From Management Boom to Management Performance” is the title of the
introduc- tory section of this book. It could have been the title of the
book itself. In the next decade managers will have to meet far greater
performance demands than most of them can en- visage, and in all areas.
A great deal more will depend on their performance than the prosperity
or even the survival of their own company or institution. For, to
repeat, per- forming management of our institutions is the only
alternative to tyranny in our pluralistic society of institutions.</p>
<p>And the aim, the motive, and the purpose of this book are to prepare
today’s and to- morrow’s managers for performance.</p>
<p>In its aim, its scope, and its approach this book differs from my
earlier management books: Concept of the Corporation (New York, John
Day, 1946; new edition 1972; Brit- ish edition, London, Heinemann, 1946
under the title Big Business); The Practice of Management (New York,
Harper andandandand Row, 1954; London, Heinemann, 1953, and in Mer- cury
and Pan paperbacks); Managing for Results (New York, Harper andandandand
Row, 1964; Lon- don, Heinsmann, 1966, and in Pan paperback); and The
Effective Executive (New York, Harper andandandand Row, 1966; London,
Heinemann, 1966, and in Pan paperback). But Manage- ment, while in every
respect a new book, did, of course, evolve out of my earlier work. And I
have not hesitated to draw on my earlier work where appropriate.</p>
<p>The heaviest debt is owed to The Practice of Management. Direct
borrowings from this earlier book are confined to a few pages in
Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, 34, and 36. But Chap- ters 20, 29, 31, and 50 also
develop ideas that were first presented in The Practice of Management.
At the most, however, such material accounts for one-twentieth or so of
the text of this new volume—and primarily for basic concepts such as the
question “What is our business?”; Business Objectives; Management by
Objectives and Self-Control; and the elements in the work of the
manager, which were first introduced in The Practice of Management
twenty years ago and have since become fundamental tenets of management
and key concepts.</p>
<p>A word might be said about the use of cases and examples in this
book. Wherever a company (or a public-service agency) is identified by
name in the book, everything in the example or illustration is taken
from published and universally accessible sources, whether the company’s
own statements and reports or reports on it in the public press. The
interpretation in every case is, of course, mine; but the facts are in
the public domain. Wherever a company—or an industry—is not specifically
identified by name I have</p>
<p>used—always with the company’s knowledge and consent—private
information, whether obtained in the course of consulting work or, more
often, through personal acquaintance, discussions in management meetings
and seminars, or private correspondence. In every such case the company
(or industry) has been so carefully camouflaged that even people in the
company itself will probably not recognize it. The one thing the reader
can be sure of if he reads of a “hardware manufacturer in the American
Midwest” is that the company is not a hardware company and is not
located in the Midwest. The facts given in the illus- tration are
reported faithfully and accurately; the specific company where they
occurred is carefully concealed.</p>
<h4 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h4>
<p>To my wife, Doris, belongs the credit for whatever clarity and
consistency this book may have. She took time out from her own work to
read the draft carefully and several times. Her incorruptible ear for
cliché, non sequitur, and bombast, and her uncompromising de- mand for
logic in argument and presentation have benefited every page.</p>
<p>My old friend and former colleague Arthur Lee Svenson, Burlington
Industries Pro- fessor of Economics and Management at the University of
North Carolina, consistently helped with encouragement and criticism
throughout the long months of gestation. I did not always welcome his
exhortation, “Try again; you can do better.” But the book owes a great
deal to it—and so do I.</p>
<p>My publishers: Cass Canfield, Jr., of Harper andandandand Row in New
York; S. Ishiyama of Diamond-Sha in Tokyo; John St. John and Malcolm
Stern of William Heinemann in Lon- don; and E.B. von Wehrenalp of Econ
Verlag in Dusseldorf constantly helped with reas- surance and advice.
Above all, they never lost patience with me even though I missed

<p>Dorothy Demke, Jean H. Kidd, and Jerrie Pulis typed countless drafts,
coped with my atrocious handwriting and with inexhaustible patience
suffered with me through all the stages of the work. They deserve my
warmest thanks.</p>
<p>The people to whom this book owes the most cannot be mentioned by
name. They are my clients—and clients—have a right to privacy. Still,
this book would not be possible if a great many executives—in businesses
and in non-business service institutions in the United States, but also
in Europe Japan, and in Latin America—had not taken me into their
confidence and, had not allowed me to share in their concerns and to
work with them on their problems. It is the experience gained in this
work and these relationships that made this book possible.</p>

Story—The Emergence of Management a Pivotal Event</p>
<p>DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS, society in every developed country has
be- come a society of institutions. Every major social task, whether
economic perform- ance or health care, education or the protection of
the environment, the pursuit of new knowledge or defense, is today being
entrusted to big organizations, designed for perpetuity and managed by
their own managements. On the performance of these institu- tions, the
performance of modern society—if not the survival of each individual—
increasingly depends.</p>
<p>Only seventy-five years ago such a society would have been
inconceivable. In the so- ciety of 1900 the family still served in every
single country as the agent of, and organ for, most social tasks.
Institutions were few and small. The society of 1900, even in the most
highly institutionalized country (e.g., Imperial Germany), still
resembled the Kansas prai- rie. There was one eminence, the central
government. It loomed very large on the hori- zon—not because it was
large but because there was nothing else around it. The rest of society
was diffused in countless molecules: small workshops, small schools, the
individ- ual professional—whether doctor or lawyer practicing by
himself, the farmer, the crafts- man, the neighborhood retail store, and
so on. There were the beginnings of big busi- ness—but only the
beginnings. And what was then considered a giant business would strike
us today as very small indeed.</p>
<p>The octopus which so frightened the grandparents of today’s
Americans, Rockefeller’s giant Standard Oil Trust, was split into
fourteen parts by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, on the eve of America’s entry into World War II,
every single one of these fourteen Standard Oil daughters had become at
least four times as large as the octo- pus when the Supreme Court
divided it—in employment, in capital, in sales, and in every other
aspect. Yet, among these fourteen there were only three major oil
companies— Jersey Standard, Mobil, and Standard of California. The other
seven were small to fair- sized, playing little or no role in the world
economy and only a limited role in the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>While business has grown in these seventy years, other institutions
have grown much faster. There was no university in the world before 1914
that had much more than 6,000 students—and only a handful that had more
than 5,000. Today the university of 6,000 students is a pygmy; there are
even some who doubt that it is viable. The hospital, simi- larly, has
grown from a marginal institution to which the poor went to die into the
center of health care and a giant in its own right—and also into one of
the most complex social</p>
<p>institutions around. Labor unions, research institutes, and many
others have similarly grown to giant size and complexity.</p>
<p>In the early 1900s the citizens of Zurich built themselves a splendid
City Hall, which they confidently believed would serve the needs of the
city for all time to come. Indeed, it was bitterly attacked by
conservatives as gross extravagance, if not as megalomania. Gov- ernment
in Switzerland has grown far less than in any other country in the
world. Yet the Zurich City Hall long ago ceased to be adequate to house
all the offices of the city ad- ministration. By now, these offices
occupy ten times or more the space that seventy-five years ago seemed so
splendid—if not extravagant.</p>
<p>The Employee Society</p>
<p>The citizen of today in every developed country is typically an
employee. He works for one of the institutions. He looks to them for his
livelihood. He looks to them for his op- portunities. He looks to them
for access to status and function in society, as well as for personal
fulfillment and achievement.</p>
<p>The citizen of 1900 if employed worked for a small family-type
operation; the small pop-and-mom store employing a helper or two; the
family household; and so on. And of course, the great majority of people
in those days, except in the most highly industrialized countries—such
as Britain or Belgium—worked on the farm.</p>
<p>Our society has become an employee society. In the early 1900s people
asked, “What do you do?” Today they tend to ask, “Whom do you work
for?”</p>
<p>We have neither political nor social theory for the society of
institutions and its new pluralism. It is, indeed, incompatible with the
political and social theories which still dominate our view of society
and our approach to political and social issues. We still use as
political and social model what the great thinkers of the late sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, Bodin, Locke, Hume, and Harrington, codified:
the society which knows no power centers and no autonomous institution,
save only one central government. Reality has long outgrown this
model—but it is still the only one we have.</p>
<p>A new theory to fit the new reality will be a long time coming. For
new theory, to be more than idle speculation and vague dreaming, must
come after the event. It codifies what we have already learned, have
already achieved, have already done. But we cannot wait till we have the
theory we need. We have to act. We have to use the little we know. And
there is one thing we do know: management is the specific organ of the
new institu- tion whether business enterprise or university, hospital or
armed service, research lab or government agency. If institutions are to
function, managements must perform.</p>
<p>The word “management” is a singularly difficult one. It is, in the
first place, specifi- cally American and can hardly be translated into
any other language, not even into British English. It denotes a function
but also the people who discharge it. It denotes a social position and
rank but also a discipline and field of study.</p>
<p>But even within the American usage, management is not adequate as a
term, for insti- tutions other than business do not speak of management
or managers, as a rule. Universi- ties or government agencies have
administrators, as have hospitals. Armed services have commanders. Other
institutions speak of executives, and so on.</p>
<p>Yet all these institutions have in common the management function,
the management task, and the management work. All of them require
management. And in all of them, management is the executive, the active
organ.</p>
<p>The institution itself is, in effect, a fiction. It is an accounting
reality, but not a social reality. When this or that government agency
makes this ruling or this decision, we know perfectly well that it is
some people within the agency who make the ruling or the deci- sion and
who act for the agency and as the effective organ of the agency. When we
speak of General Electric closing a plant, it is not, of course, General
Electric that is deciding and acting, it is a group of managers within
the company.</p>
<p>Georg Siemens, who built the Deutsche Bank into the European
continent’s leading financial institution in the decade between 1870 and
1880 (see Chapter 49, “Georg Sie-</p>
<p>mens and the Deutsche Bank”), once said, “Without management, a bank
is so much scrap, fit only to be liquidated.” Without institution there
is no management. But without management there is no institution.
Management is the specific organ of the modern insti- tution. It is the
organ on the performance of which the performance and the survival of
the institution depend.</p>
<p>Management Is Professional</p>
<p>We further know that management is independent of ownership, rank, or
power. It is ob- jective function and ought to be grounded in the
responsibility for performance. It is pro- fessional—management is a
function, a discipline, a task to be done; and managers are the
professionals who practice this discipline, carry out the functions, and
discharge these tasks. It is no longer relevant whether the manager is
also an owner; if he is, it is inciden- tal to his main function, which
is to be a manager. Eiichi Shibusawa’s Confucian ideal of the
“professional manager” in the early days of modern Japan (see Chapter 2)
has become reality. And so has Shibusawa’s basic insight that the
essence of the manager is neither wealth nor rank, but
responsibility.</p>
<p>From Business Society to Pluralism</p>
<p>The rhetoric of the New Left talks of our society as being a
big-business society. But this is as outdated as the rhetoric of the New
Left is altogether. Society in the West was a business
society—seventy-five years ago. Then business was, indeed, the most
powerful of all institutions—more powerful even than some governments.
Since the turn of the cen- tury, however, the importance of business has
gone down steadily—not because business has become smaller or weaker,
but because the other institutions have grown so much faster. Society
has become pluralist.</p>
<p>In the United States in the 1970s, no businessman compares in power
or visibility with the tycoons of 1900, such as J. P. Morgan, John J.
Rockefeller, or—a little later—Henry Ford. Few people today even know
the names of the chief executive officers of America’s biggest
corporations; the names of the tycoons were household words. Not even
the larg- est corporation today can compare in power and even in
relative wealth with those ty- coons who could hold the U.S. government
for ransom.</p>
<p>It makes little sense to speak of the “military-industrial complex.”
The high level of defense spending in the United States has for many
years been an economic depressant. It would make more sense to speak of
the “military-university complex.” No business to- day—in fact, no
business in American history—has a fraction of the power that today’s
big university has. By granting or denying admission or the college
degree, the university grants or denies access to jobs and livelihoods.
Such power no business—and no other institution—ever had before in
American history. Indeed, no earlier institution would ever have been
permitted such power.</p>
<p>In Europe things are only slightly different. Business career, have
become respectable to a degree unknown in 1900. They have gained
equality with careers in government, in academic life, or in the
military—all of which ranked socially much higher seventy-five years
ago. But still there is no one in French business today whose influence
and power can compare with that of the DeWendel family of steelmakers in
the France of the Third Republic, or with the power which a few families
of the Haute Banque exercised through their control of the Banque de
France and of French money and credit policy. There is no businessman
and no business enterprise in Germany today that can compare in power
and influence with the Krupps and other steel barons of 1900, or with I.
G. Farben in the 1920s. There is no business executive in today’s
England who can compare in power and influence with the merchant banking
families who, almost down to the 1930s, ran the Bank of England and,
through it, the British Treasury, as family fiefs.</p>
<p>Of all contemporary societies, Japan can most nearly be described as
a business soci- ety. Business management has greater influence in Japan
than in any other developed country. But even in Japan, there is no
business manager today and no business enterprise</p>
<p>whose power and influence stand comparison with the power and
influence which the great Zaibatsu concerns of 1900 or 1920—Mitsubishi,
Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Yasuda— exerted on economy and society alike.</p>
<p>In the United States of 1900, almost the only career opportunity open
to the young and ambitious was business. Today there are untold others,
each promising as much (or more) income, and advancement as rapid as a
career in business.</p>
<p>Around the turn of the century, whatever of the gross national
product did not go to the farmer went in and through the private
business economy. The non-business service institutions, beginning with
government, accounted probably for no more than 10 percent of the
non-farm gross national product of the United States at the turn of the
century and up till World War I. Today, while farming has largely become
a business, more than half of the gross national product goes to or
through service institutions which are not busi- nesses and which are
not held accountable for economic performance nor subject to mar- ket
test.</p>
<p>Well over a third of the gross national product in the United States
today goes directly to governments, federal, state, and local. Another 3
to 5 percent goes to nongovernmental schools, that is, private and
parochial, including the nongovernmental colleges and uni- versities.
Another 5 percent of GNP, that is, two-thirds of the total health-care
bill, is also nongovernmental, but also non-business. On top of this,
there is a great variety of not-for- profit activities, accounting maybe
for another 2 to 5 percent of gross national product. This adds up to 50
or perhaps as much as 60 percent of the GNP which does not go to the
business sector but to, or through, public-service institutions.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the New Left talks of the big-business society, its
actions show a keen awareness that business is not the dominant
institution. Every period of public unrest since the end of the
Napoleonic Wars began with uprisings against business. But the re- volt
against authority that swept the developed countries in the sixties
centered in the in- stitutions—especially the university—which were most
esteemed by yesterday’s radicals and which were, so to speak, the good
guys of organization thirty or forty years ago.</p>
<p>The non-business, public-service institutions do not need management
less than busi- ness. They may need it more.</p>
<p>There is growing concern with management in non-business
institutions. Among the best clients of the large American management
consulting firms these last ten or fifteen years have been government
agencies such as the Department of Defense, the city of New York, or the
Bank of England. When Canada in the late sixties first created a unified
mili- tary service, with army, navy, and air force all combined, the
first conference of Canadian generals and admirals was not on strategy;
it was on “management by objectives.” The venerable orders of the
Catholic Church are engaged in organization studies and in man- agement
development, with the Jesuits in the lead.</p>
<p>A generation or two ago, the German civil service knew that it had
the answers. But now, the city of Hamburg—long known for its excellence
in public administration—has created a management center for its civil
service and has made management the responsi- bility of one of the
senior members of the city’s government. Even the British civil service
has been reorganized with the objective of introducing “management.”</p>
<p>An increasing number of students in advanced management courses are
not business executives but executives from hospitals, from the armed
services, from city and state governments, and from school
administrations. The Harvard Business School even runs an increasingly
popular advanced management course for university presidents.</p>
<p>The management of the non-business institutions will indeed be a
growing concern from now on. Their management may well become the
central management problem— simply because the lack of management of the
public-service institution is such a glaring weakness, whether municipal
water department or graduate university.</p>
<p>And yet, business management is the exemplar. And any book on
management, such as this one, has to put business management in the
center.</p>
<p>Why Business Management Has to Be the Focus</p>
<p>One reason is history. Business enterprise was the first of the
modern institutions to emerge. From the beginning, that is, from the
emergence of the railroads and the “univer- sal banks” as large
businesses in the late nineteenth century, business enterprise was un-
mistakably a new and different institution rather than an outgrowth of
older ones, as were apparently government agency, university, hospital,
and armed service. There was, of course, concern about management in
other institutions.* But until recently it was spo- radic and undertaken
usually in connection with an acute problem and confined to it. But the
work on management in business and industry was from the beginning meant
to be generic and continuous.</p>
<p>Another reason why the study of management to this day has primarily
been a study of business management is that so far the economic sphere
alone has measurements both for the allocation of resources and for the
results of decisions. Profitability is not a perfect measurement; no one
has even been able to define it, and yet it is a measurement, despite
all its imperfections. None of the other institutions has measurements
so far. All they have are opinions—which are hardly an adequate
foundation for a discipline.</p>
<p>The most important reason for focusing on business management is that
it is the suc- cess story of this century. It has performed within its
own sphere. It has provided eco- nomic goods and services to an extent
that would have been unimaginable to the genera- tion of 1900. And it
has performed despite world wars, depressions, and dictatorships.</p>
<p>The achievement of business management enables us today to
promise—perhaps pre- maturely (and certainly rashly)—the abolition of
the grinding poverty that has been man- kind’s lot through the ages. It
is largely the achievement of business management that advanced
societies today can afford mass higher education. Business both produces
the economic means to support this expensive undertaking and offers the
jobs in which knowledge can become productive and can be paid for. That
we today consider it a social flaw and an imperfection of society for
people to be fixed in their opportunities and jobs by class and
birth—where only yesterday this was the natural and apparently
inescapable condition of mankind—is a result of our economic
performance, that is, of the perform- ance of business management. In a
world that is politically increasingly fragmented and obsessed by
nationalism, business management is one of the very few institutions
capable of transcending national boundaries.</p>
<p>The multinational corporation brings together in a common venture
management peo- ple from a great many countries with different
languages, cultures, traditions, and values, and unites them in a common
purpose. It is one of the very few institutions of our world that is not
nationalistic in its world view, its values, and its decisions; but
truly a common organ of a world economy that, so far, lacks a world
polity.</p>
<p>It is also business management to which our society increasingly
looks for leadership in respect to the quality of life. Indeed, what
sounds like harsh criticism of business man- agement tends often to be
the result of high, perhaps unrealistically high, expectations based on
the past performance of business management. “If you can do so well, why
don’t you do better?” is the underlying note.</p>
<p>This book will discuss performance in the non-business service
institution at consider- able length—a whole section of four chapters is
devoted to it. I will stress again and again that managing the service
institution is likely to be the frontier of management for the rest of
this century. But the foundation of any work on management has to be
business man- agement.</p>
<p>The emergence of management may be the pivotal event of our time, far
more impor- tant than all the events that make the headlines. Rarely, if
ever, has a new basic institution, a new leading group, a new central
function, emerged as fast as has management since the turn of the
century. Rarely in human history has a new institution proven
indispensable so</p>
<p>The work of Elihu Root as Secretary of War on the organizalion of the
General Staff of the U.S. Army is an American example; the work of
Adickes and Micquel as big-city mayors and ministers of the Crown on
local government in Germany is another; both were done between 1900 and
1910.</p>
<p>quickly. Even less often has a new institution arrived with so little
opposition, so little disturbance, so little controversy. And never
before has a new institution encompassed the globe as management has,
sweeping across boundaries of race and creed, language and traditions,
within the lifetime of many men still living and at work.</p>
<p>Today’s developed society, sans aristocracy, sans large landowners,
even sans capital- ists and tycoons, depends for leadership on the
managers of its major institutions. It de- pends on their knowledge, on
their vision, and on their responsibility. In this society,
management—its tasks, its responsibilities, its practices—is central: as
a need, as an es- sential contribution, and as a subject of study and
knowledge.</p>

Its Lessons</h4>
<p>The Management Boom—How the Management Boom Began—Its Spread—Its End—
What Have We Learned? —Management a Generic Function—Management a Disci-
pline—But Not “Technocracy”—Management Is Culturally Embedded—Management
Is Polycentric—The Changed Management World—The Roots and History of
Man- agement</p>
<p>“HE MANAGEMENT BOOM IS OVER; the time for management performance</p>
<p>For twenty-five years, from the end of World War II to the end of the
196os, a man- agement boom swept over the entire world. Management, an
obscure interest of a mere handful of people before World War II, became
a worldwide concern. The management boom reached every country in the
world, excepting perhaps only Communist China. It permanently changed
society and economy—and above all, management. It created an awareness
of management and its role, functions, and work which will remain with
us.</p>
<p>But the management boom also raised new challenges for management,
created new tasks and new problems. The management boom, as all booms
must, has come to an end. The tasks which it left behind are ahead of
us. Now is the time, therefore, to ask what the management boom has
accomplished and what its lessons are.</p>
<p>Before World War II management was the concern of a tiny band of
“true believers,”</p>
<p>mostly consultants and professors. Very few practicing managers paid
any attention, though Alfred P. Sloan at General Motors, Robert E. Wood
at Sears, Roebuck, and Ches- ter Barnard at the American Telephone
Company—to mention some prominent Ameri- cans—were significant
exceptions.* But even Barnard’s colleagues at the Telephone Company
showed no interest in what they considered his hobby. Few managers at
that time would have even realized that they practiced management; and
concern with man- agement as a field of study, as a discipline, and as a
social function was practically non- existent.</p>
<p>The most extensive management library brought together before the
days of World War II was the collection of the American consultant and
management scholar Harry Hopf (1882-1949). Now preserved in the Advanced
Management Institute of the General Electric Company in Crotonville, N.
Y., it contains several thousand volumes. But even though management was
Hopf’s own interest, there are no more than sixty or seventy vol- umes
that properly could be called management. The rest are accounting,
taxation, engi- neering, and the like. Yet, the Hopf library contained
everything written on management in any language (except Japanese) until
the 1940s.</p>
<p>While Harvard had already begun to teach management, most other
business schools of the time, American as well as European, were still
either schools of commerce or, as in</p>
<p>*On these men and others, see “Note: The Roots and History of
Management,” p. 21.</p>
<p>the case of the more progressive and sophisticated (e.g. New York
University), schools of accounting, banking, and finance. They were
schools of business skills. Management was either not taught at all or
taught only in the form of production engineering or personnel.</p>
<p>How the Management Boom Began</p>
<p>The change from neglect of management to, first, awareness of and
then to stress on man- agement came as a result of World War II. It was,
above all, the performance of American manufacturing industry during the
war that drew attention to management (though the performance of British
managers during the same period merits far more attention than it has
received). As a result, interest in management as a practice, as a
discipline, but also as a focus of social, economic, and ethical concern
began to attract growing interest in the United States.</p>
<p>The management boom, however, was triggered by a non-American. Sir
Stafford Cripps (1889-1952), Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain’s
first postwar Labour gov- ernment, was a convinced socialist. But it was
Cripps who conceived of management as the force that could restore the
British economy and could provide the impetus for its growth and
performance. It was Cripps who invented the productivity teams of
British businessmen and managers who were being sent to the United
States to learn the secrets of management. It was Cripps who, by doing
so, convinced the world—including many Americans—that management was an
American invention.</p>
<p>A few years after the start of the exchange of productivity teams
between Britain and America, the Marshall Plan was mounted, and
management received a central place in it. The Marshall Plan set out to
mobilize management for economic and social reconstruc- tion. The
success of the Marshall Plan made management a best seller. Suddenly
every- body talked management, everybody studied management.</p>
<p>It was not much later that the Japanese followed the West. The
Japanese first talked of a management boom when, after 1950, Japanese
government and Japanese business, re- gaining autonomy after years of
American occupation, began systematically to work on rebuilding the
Japanese economy. They seized upon management as the central force and
the critical factor.</p>
<p>Concern with management rapidly spread to the developing countries.
In India and in Brazil, in the newly independent countries of Africa,
and in Southeast Asia management associations were formed, management
schools came into being, management began to become a major focus of
governmental as well as of business concern.</p>
<p>Eventually the management boom reached the communist world. One
communist country after another in Europe—beginning with the heretic
Yugoslavs and followed by the Poles, the Hungarians, and the Czechs—set
up management schools and management institutes, began to translate
Western, especially American, management books, and be- gan to teach
management as the solution to economic stagnation. Ultimately even the
So- viet Union succumbed. In 1969-70 it created two advanced management
schools and si- multaneously began—though with great hesitation—to talk
about setting up autonomous managements in the major industries and
major business enterprises.</p>
<p>Management in the Developing Countries</p>
<p>The impact of the management boom on the developing countries may
have been even greater than on the developed ones. Economic and social
development means, above all, management. It became clear fairly early
in the post-World War II period that manage- ment is the crucial factor
in economic and social development. It was obvious that the economist’s
traditional view of development as a function of savings and capital
invest- ment was not adequate. Indeed, savings and capital investment do
not produce manage- ment and economic development. On the contrary,
management produces economic and social development, and with it savings
and capital investment. It became apparent that, as a popular slogan in
Latin America has it, the developing countries are not underdevel- oped,
they are undermanaged.</p>
<p>Interest in management spread rapidly throughout the developing
countries. Manage- ment schools, management institutes, and management
societies were formed in Bombay, in Mexico, in West Africa, as well as
in Turkey and Iran.</p>
<p>There were notable successes: the rapid development of Brazil; the
rapid development of the noncommunist Chinese countries, that is, of
Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan; the rapid development of so poor and
backward a peasant country as Iran; all are trace- able to the impact of
management. Management underlies the rapid growth of Mexico. And
management also accounts for the great advances made in Colombia.
Indeed, in many of these countries, pioneering work in management was
being done, e.g., by the group organized by and around the Technical
University in Monterey, Mexico, and by the</p>
<p>group organized by and around the Universidad del Valle in Cali,
Colombia.</p>
<p>Wherever rapid economic and social development took place after World
War II, it occurred as a result of systematic and purposeful work on
developing managers and man- agement.</p>
<p>Yet, it also became increasingly clear, during this period, that the
development of management and managers in most of the developing
countries was not proceeding fast enough to generate adequate
development, especially in view of the explosive growth of population.
It also became clear that we do not yet know how to transfer the
knowledge of management, its discipline, its vision, and its values, to
new and different societies and cultures. And, the one transfer
mechanism which effectively channels management com- petence into
developing countries, the multinational corporation, proved (as will be
dis- cussed in Chapter 59, “The Multinational Corporation”) ambiguous
and controversial.</p>
<p>The task of transferring management knowledge and management
competence from the developed countries to the developing ones, the task
of generating entrepreneurial and managerial energies fast enough to
satisfy the expectations of the developing world, still remains as one
of the major tasks ahead.</p>
<p>Before World War II all the books on management filled no more than a
modest shelf.</p>
<p>By the late sixties American publishers alone brought out each year
several hundred man- agement titles—four or five times as many in one
year as there had been written alto- gether in all the years before
World War II.* Before World War II only Harvard taught management; by
the late sixties the number of business schools teaching management all
over the world probably numbered well in the hundreds. Advanced
management educa- tion was almost totally unknown before World War II.
Nobody in the 1970s can count the number of advanced management courses,
advanced management seminars, special schools, special institutes, staff
colleges, and other institutions concerned with the profes- sional
formation and advanced training of managers all over the world.</p>
<p>The End of the Management Boom</p>
<p>The management boom, as all such booms must, overreached itself and
came to an end. The first sign—and this too is typical of a boom—was the
appearance of books that prophesied that the management boom would last
forever. In 1967 the American econo- mist J. Kenneth Galbraith predicted
in a worldwide best seller, The New Industrial State (Houghton Mifflin,
1967), that professional management in big corporations, armed with all
the tools of modern management techniques, had become invincible and
incapable of being displaced by any force—such as stockholders or
governments. This prediction ap- peared at the moment when professional
managers began to be unseated right and left by the takeover-raiders
promising “asset management,” with the full and enthusiastic support of
the supposedly docile and impotent stockholders.</p>
<p>*Management books have achieved the impossible: they have become best
sellers—e.g., Alfred P. Sloan, Jr.’s My Years with General Motors
(Doubleday, l964). Even satires on management have become best sellers,
such as Robert Townsend’s Up the Organization (Knopf, 1970). These books
have been read by the general public even though they are replete with
recondite and obscure management terms and management cliches which a
few years ago only a handful of initiates would have understood.</p>
<p>A year later another best seller on management by the French
journalist-politician, Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, Le Défi Américain,
English translation, The American Challenge (Atheneum, 1968), predicted
that American management was taking over the world (or at least Europe),
and that there was a “management gap” between America and Europe which
made American domination all but inescapable fate. This prediction ap-
peared—and was greeted worldwide with tremendous headlines—at the very
moment when the European economy began to forge ahead of America and
when the American economy was forced on the defensive by the Europeans
and the Japanese.</p>
<p>By 1970 the Galbraiths and Servan-Schreibers had begun to sound
naive. The man- agement boom was over. It did not end with a crash or a
bust. Indeed, there were few outward signs that anything had
happened.</p>
<p>Only in Great Britain was there substantial unemployment of managers.
And that re- flected the generally depressed state of the British
economy and the cresting wave of mergers and takeovers in Britain. But
management consulting firms that had sharply ex- panded in the late
sixties suddenly found their sales far below expectations. Yet firms
that had been more conservative and had spent their resources on
building quality rather than on adding staff continued to do
extraordinarily well, in respect to both billings and fees. Such
management programs, management books, and management speakers who had
something to say continued in high demand; indeed, around 1970
non-business manage- ments, e.g., of public-service institutions;
greatly stepped up their attendance at manage- ment programs, their
buying of management books, and their use of management speak- ers. But
the users became far more discriminating and demanding. Applications to
busi- ness schools and to advanced management courses continued to
climb; the students, how- ever, were becoming quite critical of
curriculum and teaching performance.</p>
<p>What happened was that the mystique of management was suddenly gone.
One reason may have been the dollar crisis of 1971, which must have
convinced even the least obser- vant that there was no management gap.
Another reason may have been the business de- bacles of that period—Penn
Central and Lockheed in the U.S., Rolls-Royce in England— which made
professional management look somewhat less than heroic. But the main
rea- son was surely that managers themselves suddenly realized that
management is challenge and work rather than a panacea, and that
management techniques, no matter how sophisti- cated, are not magic
spells. Above all, managers everywhere realized that the foundation on
which the management boom had been based, that is, the knowledge
acquired in the long years of obscurity before World War II, had been
outpaced by new developments. New knowledge, new basic approaches, and
new understanding, it was beginning to be seen, were needed. And those
the management boom could not supply.</p>
<p>While it has run its course, the management boom has nevertheless
permanently changed the world’s economic and social landscape. There is
no return to the period of management innocence, of management
ignorance, and of management obscurity, that is, to the period before
World War II and before the boom. Above all, the awareness of man-
agement as a force, as a function, as a responsibility, and as a
discipline will remain. It is the one permanent result of the management
boom. It is also the most important result.</p>
<p>What Have We Learned?</p>
<p>What have we learned in these twenty-five years? Especially, what
have we learned that should enable us to tackle the demands of the new
era, the era of management perform- ance?</p>
<p>The first thing is that management, that is, the organ of leadership,
direction, and deci- sion in our social institutions, and especially in
business enterprise, is a generic function which faces the same basic
tasks in every country and, essentially, in every society. Man- agement
has to give direction to the institution it manages. It has to think
through the in- stitution’s mission, has to set its objectives, and has
to organize resources for the results the institution has to contribute.
Management is, indeed, J. B. Say’s “entrepreneur” and responsible for
directing vision and resources toward greatest results and
contributions.</p>
<p>In performing these essential functions, management everywhere faces
the same prob- lems. It has to organize work for productivity, it has to
lead the worker toward productiv- ity and achievement. It is responsible
for the social impact of its enterprise. Above all, it is responsible
for producing the results—whether economic performance, student learn-
ing, or patient care—for the sake of which each institution exists.</p>
<p>Management as a Discipline</p>
<p>This means, above all, that managers practice management. They do not
practice econom- ics. They do not practice quantification. They do not
practice behavioral science. These are tools for the manager. But he no
more practices economics than a physician practices blood testing. He no
more practices behavioral sciences than a biologist practices the mi-
croscope. He no more practices quantification than a lawyer practices
precedents. He practices management.</p>
<p>One implication is that there are specific managerial skills which
pertain to manage- ment, rather than to any other discipline. One of
these is communications within organiza- tions. Another is the making of
decisions under conditions of uncertainty. And there is also a specific
entrepreneurial skill: strategic planning.</p>
<p>As a specific discipline, management has its own basic problems, its
own specific ap- proaches, its own distinct concerns. A manager who
understands the discipline of man- agement will still be an
effective—and may even be a first-rate—manager with no more than minimum
competence in managerial skills and tools. A man who knows only the
skills and techniques, without understanding the fundamentals of
management, is not a manager; he is, at best, a technician.</p>
<p>Management is a practice rather than a science. In this, it is
comparable to medicine, law, and engineering. It is not knowledge but
performance. Furthermore, it is not the ap- plication of common sense,
or leadership, let alone financial manipulation. Its practice is based
both on knowledge and on responsibility.</p>
<p>Technocracy Is Not Enough</p>
<p>The management boom has proven that the manager must be more than a
“technocrat.” He cannot be confined to his discipline, cannot be content
with mastery of his skills, his tools, and his techniques.</p>
<p>Management is not culture-free, that is, part of the world of nature.
It is a social func- tion. It is, therefore, both socially accountable
and culturally embedded.</p>
<p>General Motors may well be the best illustration of the inadequacy of
the technocrat concept of management. In the technocrat’s terms, that
is, in terms of company perform- ance, whether measured by market
standing, by profit, or by productivity, General Motors in the
post-World War II period has been an outstanding success. But at the
same time, General Motors has been a resounding failure in public
opinion, in politics, in its standing in the public esteem. Instead of
reaping the rewards for its success as a technocrat, that is, as a
business manager, General Motors has been forced on the defensive.*</p>
<p>The manager has to be a craftsman. His first duty is, indeed, to make
his institution perform the mission and purpose for the sake of which it
exists—whether this be goods and service, learning, or patient care. But
this is not enough. Any institution exists for the sake of society and
within a community. It, therefore, has to have impacts; and one is re-
sponsible for one’s impacts. In the society of institutions of the
developed countries, the leadership groups, that is, the managers of the
various institutions, also have to take social responsibility, have to
think through the values, the beliefs, the commitments of their so-
ciety, and have to assume leadership responsibility beyond the discharge
of the specific and limited mission of their institutions. This
responsibility creates a major new chal-</p>

to the 1972 reissue of my study of General Motors, Concept of the
Corporation, originally published in 1946.</p>
<p>lenge—and raises the most difficult problems, both of management and
of political theory and practice. But it has become a fact.</p>
<p>Management and Its Society</p>
<p>Management is an objective function, determined by the tasks, that
is, it is a discipline. And yet it is culturally conditioned and subject
to the values, the traditions, the habits of a given society.* The
management boom owes a great deal of its force to the fact that man-
agement is not value-free.</p>
<p>The excitement over management in continental Europe, for instance,
was in large measure the result of the promise that management would
change cultural and social tra- ditions. Management in the Europe of the
fifties was, so to speak, the counterculture, which was welcomed,
especially by the young and educated, as the battering ram to level the
ramparts of privilege and of the class structure and with them, the
obstacles to oppor- tunities which emphasis on birth, wealth, or elite
education (e.g., in France) had put in the path of the able
individual.</p>
<p>The excitement was even more pronounced in the communist world. There
manage- ment promises truly to be a major political and cultural force
against the establishment. Though surely an oversimplification, the
developments of the sixties in the Soviet bloc can largely be explained
in terms of the dynamics of management and their impacts on communist
ideology and organization.</p>
<p>In the Russian satellite countries management was, to a large extent,
the rallying cry of those who opposed the imposition of an alien, that
is, Russian, system on their country. The communist reformers, first in
Yugoslavia, then in Hungary, and finally, in Czecho- slovakia, demanded
managerial autonomy; that demand was at the center of their opposi- tion
to Stalinism. In part, of course, their motives were economic. But in
equal measure, they looked to management as a force to reform government
and society. Management to them embodied specifically Western values:
the value of individual responsibility, the value of autonomy, respect
for the individual. Management, precisely because it is not a political
program but a social and economic function, became their hope for the
preserva- tion of their culture and society in the Western
tradition.</p>
<p>For this reason too, management has become highly controversial in
the Soviet Union and a potential threat to the Stalinist legacy of
totalitarian despotism. When the Czechs proceeded to make their managers
autonomous, the Russians felt that they had to move in their troops and
tanks to stamp out this heresy; their own regime at home could not have
survived such a development. For this reason, any movement toward
management, no matter how badly needed to restore the Russian economy’s
capacity for growth and per- formance, is being resisted every inch of
the way by all the entrenched forces of the Rus- sian bureaucracy, and
also of the Russian tradition. Management, one might suspect, rather
than the “intellectuals,” is the central threat to the Russian system.
Management is, in effect, the “internal contradiction” of Communism.
Marx was absolutely right when he attack, well over a hundred years ago,
the “utopian socialists” as antisocialists. Their em- phasis on manager
and entrepreneur as central, dynamic forces in society is, indeed, in-
compatible with the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>
<p>The great question ahead of China, after Mao is gone, will certainly
be the question of management and managers. Without facing up to this
question, China may not be able to sustain economic growth or political
cohesion. If it decides for bureaucracy—that is, for the Stalinist
path—it can postpone this decision for a couple of decades, though
probably only at a price in human lives, in terror, in suffering, and in
spiritual debasement similar to that which Russia has had to pay for
Stalinism. If it accepts management and managers, China will, however,
equally have turned its back on Mao. The one thing that is unlikely</p>
<p>*A non-Western scholar, the Japanese Chie Nakane, has seen this much
more clearly than any Westerner— precisely because the Japanese
tradition is not a Western tradition, whereas management is distinctly a
Western concept. See her book, Japanese Society (University of
California Press,1970).</p>
<p>is Mao’s plan to have neither the monolithic government apparatus nor
the autonomous and responsible manager.</p>
<p>It is also clear—though it may sound contradictory—that the more
management can use the traditions, values, and beliefs of a society, the
more it will accomplish. The man- agement boom, while it put into
question social and cultural traditions, also strengthened them. At the
height of the boom, in the early and mid-sixties, there was a good deal
of talk about the Americanization of the world; and especially, the
Americanization of manage- ment. To be sure, insofar as management and
managers have come to recognize that they face the same tasks, they have
come to resemble each other. But the management boom has also been used
to strengthen differences and different ways.</p>
<p>Whether today’s Japan is westernized or whether the westernization is
just a surface phenomenon enabling Japan to be even more Japanese than
ever is not within the scope of this book (or within the competence of
its author). But there is little doubt that Japanese management has not
become westernized. It has accepted management concepts. It has eagerly
grasped tools and techniques. It has listened. But it has used
management, its con- cepts, its tools and techniques to remain Japanese.
And only to the extent to which the concepts and tools of management
enable the Japanese institution—whether business en- terprise or
government agency—to retain and to strengthen basic Japanese values have
they been adopted.</p>
<p>Neither have European basic concepts in respect to management been
overturned by the management boom. Top-management structure, for
instance, has remained very much the same in Germany, in France, and in
Italy. Only in Great Britain has there been a change in which the
formerly undifferentiated board of directors has become divided into
executive members, that is, top management in the American sense of the
word, and non-</p>
<p>executive members, that is, the supervisory group.</p>
<p>Career ladders too have been affected only to a slight degree.</p>
<p>In France a man still gets to the top in a big company by graduating
from one of the grandes écoles, especially the École Polytechnique,
going to work for the government as a generalist and then, twenty-five
years later and with the rank of inspecteur de finance, moving directly
into top management in business. In Germany the two parallel career
ladders, as an engineer in highly specialized technical work and as a
graduate in law (or perhaps, economics) in unspecialized staff work,
still dominate. In Great Britain the best starting point for a
top-management position is still accounting.</p>
<p>The one change has been the addition of marketing as a career ladder.
But it is per- haps symptomatic that in Great Britain, where marketing
has become most respectable, the marketing people in top-management
positions tend to have made their careers in the British subsidiaries of
American companies.</p>
<p>The management boom also left untouched the relationship between
business and government in major countries. If anything, it has
accentuated traditions: those of an ad- versary relationship in the
U.S.; of the mercantilist tradition in continental Europe; of the Ie,
the “extended family,” in Japan , and of the “club” in Britain. (On this
important topic see Chapter 27.) By restoring the capacity of Europe and
Japan to grow, the management boom has brought out clearly that
management is not American. There is no American challenge. Just as the
world of the 1970s has become polycentric in its politics and poly-
centric in its economics, so it he’s become polycentric in its
management. We now know that all of us—Americans, Europeans, Japanese,
and many others—have to learn man- agement from each other.</p>
<p>Note: The Roots and History of Management</p>
<p>Some recent writers on management seem to believe that the management
boom invented, or at least discovered, management. This, needless to
say, is nonsense. Management, both as a practice and as a field of
thought and study, has a long history. Its roots go back al- most two
hundred years.</p>
<p>Management, one might say, was discovered before there was any
management to speak of. The great English economists, from Adam Smith
(1723-1790) to David Ricardo (1772-1823) to John Stuart Mill (1806-873),
including their successor and antagonist, Karl Marx (1818-1883), knew no
management. To them the economy was impersonal and objective. As a
modern exponent of the classical tradition, the Anglo-American Kenneth
Boulding (b. 1910) phrases it, “Economics deals with the behavior of
commodities rather than with the behavior of men.” Or, as with Marx,
impersonal laws of history were seen to dominate. Men can only adapt.
Man can, at best, optimize what the economy makes pos- sible; at worst,
he impedes the forces of the economy and wastes resources. The last of
the great English classical economists, Alfred Marshall (1842-1924), did
indeed add man- agement to the factors of production, land, labor, and
capital. But this was a half-hearted concession. Management was still,
even to Marshall, an extraneous factor, rather than central.</p>
<p>From the beginning there was a different approach which put the
manager into the center of the economy and which stressed the managerial
task of making resources pro- ductive. J. B. Say (1767-1832), perhaps
the most brilliant economist produced by France—or for that matter by
continental Europe—was an early follower of Adam Smith and the
propagandist for The Wealth of Nations in France. But in his own works
the pivot is not the factors of production. It is the entrepreneur—a
word Say coined—who directs resources from less productive into more
productive investments and who thereby creates wealth. Say was followed
by the “utopian socialists” of the French tradition, especially François
Fourier (1772-1837) and that eccentric genius, the Comte de Saint-Simon
(1760- 1825). At that time there were no large organizations and no
managers, but both Fourier and Saint-Simon anticipated developments and
“discovered” management before it actu- ally came into being.
Saint-Simon in particular saw the emergence of organization. And he saw
the task of making resources productive and of building social
structures. He saw managerial tasks.</p>
<p>It is for their stress on management, as a separate and distinct
force, and one which can act independently of the factors of production
as well as of the laws of history, that Marx vehemently denounced the
French and gave them the derisory name of “utopians.” But it is the
French—and above all, Saint-Simon—who, in effect, laid down the basic
approaches and the basic concepts on which every socialist economy has
actually been designed. No matter how much the Russians today invoke the
name of Marx, their spiri- tual ancestor is Saint-Simon.</p>
<p>In America too management was early seen as central. Alexander
Hamilton’s (1757- 1804) famous “Report on Manufactures’” starts out with
Adam Smith, but then Hamilton gave emphasis to the constructive,
purposeful, and systematic role of management. He saw in management,
rather than in economic forces, the engine of economic and social
development; and in organization, the carrier of economic advance.
Following him, Henry Clay (1777-1852) with his famous “American system”
produced what might be called the first blueprint for systematic
economic development.</p>
<p>A little later, an industrialist in Scotland, Robert Owen
(1771-1858), actually became</p>
<p>the first manager. In his textile mill in Lanark, Owen; in the 1820s,
first tackled the prob- lems of productivity and motivation, of the
relationship of worker to work, of worker to enterprise, and of worker
to management—to this day key questions in management. With Owen, the
manager emerges as a real person, rather than as an abstraction, as in
Say, Fou- rier, Saint-Simon, Hamilton, and Clay. But it was a long time
before Owen had succes- sors.</p>
<p>The Emergence of Large-Scale Organization</p>
<p>What had to happen first was the rise of large-scale organization.
This occurred simulta- neously—around 1870—in two places. In North
America the transcontinental railroad emerged as a managerial problem.
On the continent of Europe, the “universal bank”—</p>
<p>entrepreneurial in aim, national in scope, and with multiple
headquarters—obsolete tradi- tional structures and concepts and required
management.</p>
<p>One response was given by Henry Towne (1844-1924) in the United
States, especially in his paper “The Engineer as Economist.” Towne
outlined what might be called the first program for management. He
raised basic questions: effectiveness as against efficiency;
organization of the work as against the organization of the plant
community, that is, of the workers; value set in the marketplace and by
the customer as against technical accom- plishment. With Towne begins
the systematic concern with the relationship between the tasks of
management and the work of management.</p>
<p>At roughly the same time, in Germany, Georg Siemens (1839-1901), in
building the Deutsche Bank into the leading financial institution of
continental Europe, first designed an effective top management, first
thought through the top-management tasks, and first tackled the basic
problems of communications and information in the large organization (on
Siemens see Chapter 49).</p>
<p>In Japan, Eiichi Shibusawa (1840-1931), the Meiji statesman turned
business leader, in the seventies and eighties first raised fundamental
questions regarding the relationship between business enterprise and
national purpose, and between business needs and indi- vidual ethics. He
tackled management education systematically. Shibusawa envisioned the
professional manager first. The rise of Japan in this century to
economic leadership is largely founded on Shibusawa’s thought and
work.</p>
<p>A few decades later, in the years before and after the turn of the
century, all the major approaches to modern management were fashioned.
Again the developments occurred independently in many countries.</p>
<p>In the 1880s Frederic W. Taylor (1856-1915), the self-taught American
engineer, be- gan the study of work. It is fashionable today to look
down on Taylor and to decry his outmoded psychology, but Taylor was the
first man in the known history of mankind who did not take work for
granted, but looked at it and studied it. His approach to work is still
the basic foundation (on this see Chapter 17). And, while Taylor in his
approach to the worker was clearly a man of the nineteenth century, he
started out with social rather than engineering or profit objectives.
What led Taylor to his work and provided his motivation throughout was
first the desire to free the worker from the burden of heavy toil,
destruc- tive of body and soul. And then it was the hope to break the
Iron Law of wages of the classical economists (including Marx) which
condemned the worker to economic insecu- rity and to enduring poverty.
Taylor’s hope—and it has largely been fulfilled in the de- veloped
countries—was to make it possible to give the laborer a decent
livelihood through increasing the productivity of work.</p>
<p>Around the same time in France, Henri Fayol (1841-1925), head of a
coal mine which for its time was a very large company, first thought
through organization structure and developed the first rational approach
to the organization of enterprise: the functional prin- ciple. In
Germany, Walter Rathenau (1867-1922), whose early training had been in a
large company (the German equivalent of the General Electric Company,
AEG, founded by his father, Emil (1838-1915), but developed in large
part under the supervision of Georg Siemens), asked: “What is the place
of the large enterprise in a modern society and in a modern nation? What
impact does it have on both? And, what are its fundamental contributions
and its fundamental responsibilities?” Most present questions of the
social responsibilities of business were first raised and thought
through by Rathenau in the years before World War I. Also in Germany, at
the same time, the new discipline of Betrieb- swissenschaft was
developed by such men as Eugen Schmalenbach (1813-1955). The management
sciences developed since managerial accounting, operations research,
deci- sion theory, and so on—are largely extensions, though in the main,
unconscious ones, of the Betriebswissenschaft of those years before
World War I. And in America, German- born Hugo Muensterborg (1863-1916)
first tried to apply the social and behavioral sci- ences, and
especially psychology, to modern organization and management.</p>
<p>The First Management Boom</p>
<p>After World War I there came what might be called the first
management boom. It was sparked primarily by two of the most highly
respected statesmen of the period, the Ameri- can Herbert Hoover
(1874-1964) and the Czech Thomas J. Masaryk (1850-1937). Hoo- ver, the
Quaker engineer, had vaulted to worldwide prominence by applying
principles of management to the first massive foreign-aid operation in
history: the feeding of hundreds of thousands of starving people: first,
before America’s entry into World War I in his Belgian Relief Operation,
and then after the end of World War I in the relief operations in
Central and Eastern Europe. But it was Masaryk, the historian, who had
become the first president of the new Czech Republic, who conceived the
idea that management would be able to restore the economies of Europe
after their destruction by war—an idea that then found its realization
twenty-five years later in the Marshall Plan after World War II. These
two men founded the international management movement and tried to
mobilize management as a major social force.</p>
<p>But the period between the two World Wars was not congenial to such
an idea. It was a period of stagnation, a period in which the highest
goal which any national government or any economy—except the United
States—could conceive was a return to prewar, that is, a restoration of
what had been. It rapidly became a world in which mounting political,
social, and economic tensions paralyzed will as well as vision.</p>
<p>The Work of the Twenties and Thirties</p>
<p>The first management boom fizzled out. Its high hopes were replaced
by frustration. Yet behind the apparent stagnation work went on. It was
in those years that the foundations for the sweeping management boom of
the post-World War II period were put in place.</p>
<p>In the early twenties, Pierre S. du Pont (1870-1954) at the Du Pont
Company, fol- lowed by Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. (1875-1966) at General
Motors, first developed the organi- zation principle for the new “big
business,” the principle of decentralization. Du Pont and, even more,
Sloan also first developed systematic approaches to business objectives,
to business strategy, and to strategic planning. Also, in the United
States, Sears, Roebuck— led first by Julius Rosenwald (1862-1932) and
then by Robert E. Wood (1819-1969)— built the first business to be based
on the marketing approach. In Europe shortly thereaf- ter, the
architects of the Dutch-English merger that resulted in the Unilever
Companies designed what to this day may well be the most advanced
structure for the multinational corporation and came to grips also with
the problem of multinational business planning and multinational
marketing.</p>
<p>The discipline of management was also further developed. In the
United States there were the successors to Taylor, the husband and wife
team of Frank and Lillian Gilbreth (1868-1924, 1878-1972), and Henry
Gantt (1861-1919). In Great Britain Ian Hamilton (1853-1947), reflecting
on his experiences as a military leader during World War I, real- ized
the need to balance formal structure and the policies that give “soul”
to an organiza- tion. Two Americans, Mary Parker Follett (1868-1933) and
Chester Barnard (1886- 1961), first studied the process of
decision-making in organizations, the relationships be- tween formal and
informal organizations, and the role and function of the executive.
Cyril Burt (1883-1972) in England and the Australian Elton Mayo
(1880-1949), working at Harvard, developed, respectively, industrial
psychology and human relations and applied each to enterprise and
management.</p>
<p>Management as a discipline also began to be taught in the interwar
years. The Harvard Business School first began in the thirties to teach
courses in management—though still mainly in production management. And
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology started, at the same time,
advanced management work with young executives in mid- career.</p>
<p>The American James McKinsey (1889-1937) and the Englishman Lyndall F.
Urwick (b. 1891) started management consulting, that is, consulting no
longer confined to techni- cal problems, but dealing with fundamental
management concerns such as business policy</p>
<p>and management organization. Urwick also classified and codified the
work on the struc- ture of management and on the function of the
executive that had been done until that time.</p>
<h4 id="the-new-challenges">3 The New Challenges</h4>
<p>The Management Boom and Its Conceptual Foundations—The Need for New
Knowl- edge in the Foundation Areas—The Productivity Need—Beyond
Decentralization— The Need for a New Model—From Personnel Management to
the Leadership of Peo- ple—The New Demands—The Entrepreneurial
Manager—Multi-Institutional Man- agement—Knowledge and Knowledge
Worker—Multinational and Multicultural Management—Management and the
Quality of Life—Management’s New Role</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>here were seven conceptual foundations to the management boom: (1)
agement of work as the key to productivity; (2) decentralization as
a</p>
<p>scientific man- basic principle</p>
<p>of organization; (3) personnel management as the orderly way of
fitting people into organization structures (which included such things
as job descriptions, appraisals, wage and salary administration, but
also “Human Relations”); (4) manager development to pro- vide today for
the management needs of tomorrow; (5) managerial accounting, that is,
the use of analysis and information as the foundation for managerial
decision-making; (6) marketing; (7) finally, there was long-range
planning.</p>
<p>Each of the seven was practiced successfully well before the
management boom got going (as discussed in the “Note: The Roots and
History of Management” at the conclu- sion of the preceding chapter).
The management boom, in other words, refined, added, modified—but
created little. It made accessible to managers everywhere what, up to
then, had been the arcane knowledge of a few experts. It made into
general practice what, till then, had been the rare exception.</p>
<p>The Need for New Knowledge in the Foundation Areas</p>
<p>By the late sixties or early seventies it was becoming clear that the
knowledge on which the management boom was founded no longer sufficed.
Even in most of the foundation areas there emerged needs for new
knowledge, particularly with respect to productivity, organization
design and structure, and the management of people. Scientific
management could no longer deliver increased productivity. In every
country there was a productivity crisis resulting in severe inflationary
pressures.</p>
<p>In retrospect it is becoming apparent that the great productivity
increases of the post- World War II period in Western Europe and Japan
were only partially the result of better management. The main cause was
the movement of very large numbers of people from areas and employments
of low productivity, e.g., marginal subsistence farming in Sicily, in
Spain, and in Japan’s mountainous north, into high-productivity
employment in indus- try. Without such massive migration the
productivity gains of these growth areas would probably have been quite
modest. But these migrations are over. In Western Europe the limit of
absorptive capacity for guest workers has clearly been reached. In Japan
there is not much population left in marginal farming. From now on
productivity gains in these</p>
<p>countries will have to be achieved by making existing workers more
productive in exist- ing jobs.</p>
<p>At the same time the demands on economic performance that can be
satisfied only through higher productivity are escalating. Affluence,
for instance, everybody “knew” (and many still believe) would greatly
reduce the demand for economic performance. Once we knew how to produce
material goods, the demand on the economic function in society would
surely lessen. Instead we are confronted with a rising tide of human
expec- tations. When President Kennedy coined this phrase in the early
sixties, he had in mind the explosive growth of demands for economic
rewards and satisfactions on the part of the poor, the underdeveloped
countries of the world. But affluence has released a similar rising tide
of human expectations among the remaining poor of the developed
countries, whether American Negro or Sicilian peasant. And the affluent
themselves are escalating their demands for economic performance faster
than their own capacity to perform. The educated young people, contrary
to the headlines in the popular press, show little sign of diminished
demand for the traditional economic goods and services (even though
tradi- tional economic theory—the so-called Engel’s Law—would have
predicted such a drop). They show, in addition, an insatiable appetite
for new services and new satisfactions—for education, for health care,
for housing, or for leisure.</p>
<p>Equally new, and perhaps even more costly, is the demand for a clean
environment. It too was a luxury until now. That the masses of
yesterday, in city slum or sharecropper’s shanty, enjoyed clean air,
clean streets, safe water, and wholesome unadulterated food is nostalgic
delusion.</p>
<p>Every one of these new expectations and demands requires massive
economic efforts.</p>
<p>Every one of them absorbs economic resources on a grand scale. Every
one of them pre- supposes, above all, an economic surplus beyond
anything the economy has ever pro- duced before. To satisfy these
demands requires, in other words, a far higher level of pro-
ductivity.</p>
<p>We know what is needed. First the traditional approach focuses on
only one factor of productivity: labor. But productivity is the output
of all three factors of production: land, labor, and capital, in
balance. Even in respect to the productivity of labor, we have taken
only the first step: the analysis of individual pieces of work. We need
to understand the principles of production so as to put work together
into the most productive process. And we need to harmonize the very
different requirements and logics of work and worker.</p>
<p>Beyond Decentralization</p>
<p>Decentralization is the best principle of organization design where
it fits. But the specifi- cations for its application are fairly
stringent. It fits the business for which it was origi- nally designed:
manufacturing, with distinct markets for distinct product lines. It fits
few non-manufacturing businesses perfectly or even adequately. And it
does not fit manufac- turing businesses such as the process industries
(e.g., aluminum or steel), where the same process produces a variety of
products with an infinity of overlapping markets.</p>
<p>Decentralization, we have further learned, is the best principle for
the task of operat- ing an ongoing business. It does not answer the
organizational demands of the innovating task. And it is not enough, by
itself, to organize the top-management task.</p>
<p>As a result of our experience we are looking at new—and so far still
largely experi- mental—design principles: the task force team; simulated
decentralization; the systems organization. They are far from
satisfactory, so far. But their emergence bespeaks a great need for new
models of organization design.</p>
<p>We know that the model which the management boom took to be the
universal one is only a partial model, and in fact no longer the ruling
model. The management boom was, in all areas, based on work done in and
with manufacturing companies, companies that essentially had one product
or one product line, operated within one national market, and which
predominantly employed manual labor. The model, in other words, was
General Motors.</p>
<p>Increasingly the dominant institutions to be managed and organized,
even in the busi- ness field, are not manufacturing companies, not
single-product companies operating in one country or one market alone,
not companies employing primarily manual labor. They are businesses in
the service industries—banking or retail businesses, and non-businesses
such as hospitals and universities. They are multi-product,
multi-technology, multi-market businesses. They are multinational
businesses. And increasingly, the central human re- sources are not
manual workers—skilled or unskilled—but knowledge workers: company
presidents but also computer programmers; engineers, medical
technologists, hospital administrators, salesmen and cost accountants;
teachers, and the entire employed educated middle class which has become
the center of population gravity in every developed coun- try. In other
words, the model of yesterday is becoming less and less pertinent. But
we do not, so far, have a new model.</p>
<p>From Personnel Management to the Leadership of People</p>
<p>Finally, we know that we will have to go beyond personnel management.
We will have to learn to lead people rather than to contain them.</p>
<p>Our traditional approaches fall into three categories. In part they
are philanthropic: the desire to look after the needs, the housing, the
health care, the welfare of people who can- not look after themselves.
In part the traditional approaches are procedural: to handle in an
orderly fashion the recurrent chores connected with the employment of
people. In large measure, finally, the traditional approaches aim at
preventing and curing trouble; they see in people, above all, potential
threats.</p>
<p>The traditional approaches are needed. They are, however, not enough.
Beyond them we will have to learn to look on people as resource and
opportunity rather than as prob- lem, cost, and threat. We will have to
learn to lead rather than to manage, and to direct rather than to
control.</p>
<p>The New Demands</p>
<p>While in important areas the old approaches and the old knowledge
have been outgrown, demands have appeared in entirely new areas which
only a few people at the start of the management boom even divined, let
alone studied. Some of the fundamental assumptions on which the
management boom based itself—the assumptions of all the work on man-
agement during the past century—are being put into doubt by new
developments demand- ing new vision, new work, and new knowledge.</p>
<p>The Entrepreneurial Manager</p>
<p>For three-quarters of a century management has meant primarily
managing the estab- lished, going business. Entrepreneurship and
innovation, while mentioned in many man- agement books, were not seen as
central from 1900 till today. From now on, management will have to
concern itself more and more with creating the new in addition to
optimizing the already existing. Managers will have to become
entrepreneurs, will have to learn to build and manage innovative
organizations.</p>
<p>We face a period of innovation such as the one in which the modern
industrial econ- omy was born in the last half of the nineteenth
century. Then, in the fifty years between the end of America’s Civil War
and the outbreak of World War I, a new major invention made its
appearance on average every fifteen or eighteen months. Each soon
spawned new businesses and entirely new industries. Practically all the
industries that we consider “modern” today, including aircraft and
electronics, grew out of these inventions of the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries. Economic growth right through the period of
reconstruction after World War II was carried primarily by technologies
that had been fully developed by the time World War I broke out, and by
the four large industries built on these technologies: steel, the
automobile, scientific agriculture, and organic chemistry. Now we face
another period of major technological change in which the thrust of
eco-</p>
<p>nomic and industrial development will come from industries based on
new, twentieth- century technologies and their development.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to the late nineteenth century, much of the new
technology will have to be developed and, above all, will have to be
applied in and by already existing busi- nesses. In the late nineteenth
century the archetype was the inventor, a Siemens, a Nobel, an Ericson,
an Alexander Graham Bell, who worked by himself, at most with a few
assis- tants. Even then successful application of an invention very
rapidly led to the emergence of an enterprise. But it was not the
enterprise that had to generate the new. These days increasingly it will
be the existing, often large organization to which we will have to look
for innovation—for the simple reason that both the trained people and
the money needed to develop the new are concentrated in existing and
usually large organizations. Manage- ment will therefore have to learn
to run, at one and the same time, an existing managerial organization
and a new innovative organization.</p>
<p>The need for social innovation may be even greater than for technical
innovation. So- cial innovation has played as large a part in social and
economic change and development as technical innovation. The needs of
our society—the need for rapid social and economic development in the
poor two-thirds of the world; the needs of our big cities; the needs of
the environment; the need for productivity in education and health
care—all these are opportunities for social innovation by business and
business managers. They are opportu- nities for the entrepreneur, and as
such often challenges to, and make demands on, the knowledge, the skill,
the performance of management.</p>
<p>Multi-Institutional Management</p>
<p>The management boom was a boom in business management, and most
management work of the preceding century centered in managing a
business. Now we know, however, that all our institutions need
management.</p>
<p>This would have been heresy only a few years ago (as it still is in
England and France to a good many managers in businesses and service
institutions alike). Running a business and administering a
public-service institution, e.g., a hospital, were then seen as being
poles apart. The mission and purpose of an institution does indeed make
a basic differ- ence. Nothing is less likely to cure the managerial ills
of the public-service institution than the attempt to make its
management “businesslike” (on this see Chapters 11 through 14). But
then, an investment banking firm also requires management that is
different from that of a steel mill or of a department store. And the
manager in public-service institutions faces the same tasks as the
manager in a business: to perform the function for the sake of which the
institution exists; to make work productive and the worker achieving; to
man- age the institution’s social impacts and to discharge its social
responsibilities. These are managerial tasks. Public-service
institutions equally face the challenge of innovation, and have to
manage growth, diversity, and complexity. And we do know, as said
before, that a central management need is to make the non-business, the
service institution, manageable and managed for performance.</p>
<p>Knowledge and Knowledge Worker</p>
<p>A primary task of management in the developed countries in the
decades ahead will be to make knowledge productive. The manual worker is
yesterday—and all we can fight on that front is a rearguard action. The
basic, capital resource, the fundamental investment, but also the cost
center of a developed economy, is the knowledge worker who puts to work
what he has learned in systematic education, that is, concepts, ideas,
and theories, rather than the man who puts to work manual skill or
muscle.</p>
<p>Taylor put knowledge to work to make the manual worker productive.
His industrial engineer was one of the first knowledge workers employed
in the manufacturing process. But Taylor himself never asked the
question What constitutes “productivity” with respect to the industrial
engineer who applies “scientific management”? As a result of Taylor’s
work, we could define what productivity is with respect to the manual
worker; we still</p>
<p>cannot answer what productivity is with respect to the industrial
engineer, or to any other knowledge worker. The measurements which give
us productivity for the manual worker, such as the number of pieces
turned out per hour or per dollar of wage, are irrelevant if applied to
the knowledge worker. There are few things as useless and unproductive
as the engineering department which with great dispatch, industry, and
elegance turns out the drawings for an unsellable product. Productivity
with respect to the knowledge worker is, in other words, primarily
quality.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: making knowledge productive will bring about
changes in job structure, careers, and organizations as drastic as those
which resulted in the factory from the application of scientific
management to manual work. The entrance job—that is, the job that first
introduces the man or woman with high formal education to the adult
world of work and experience—will have to be changed drastically to
enable the knowledge worker to become productive. For it is abundantly
clear that knowledge cannot be produc- tive unless the knowledge worker
finds out who he is himself, what kind of work he is fitted for, and how
he works best. There can be no divorce of planning from doing in
knowledge work. On the contrary, the knowledge worker must he able to
plan himself. Present, entrance jobs, by and large, do not make this
possible. They are based on the assumption—valid to some extent for
manual work but quite inappropriate to knowledge work—that an outside
expert such as the industrial engineer or the work-study specialist can
objectively determine the one best way for any kind of work to be done.
For knowl- edge work, this is simply not true. There may be one best
way, but it is heavily condi- tioned by the individual and not entirely
determined by physical, or even by mental, char- acteristics of the job.
It is temperamental as well.</p>
<p>Multinational and Multicultural Management</p>
<p>There is need for business managements to be multinational.
Economically the world, and especially the developed world, has become
one market. And the underdeveloped, the poor, countries differ from the
developed ones only in their inability to afford what they would like to
have. In terms of its demands, its appetites, and its economic values,
the whole world has become one global shopping center, however divided
it may be politi- cally. The multinational enterprise which optimizes
productive resources, market oppor- tunities, and talents beyond and
across national boundaries is thus a normal, indeed a nec- essary,
response to economic reality.</p>
<p>But all these developments introduce complexity into management well
beyond what earlier generations had to deal with. For management is also
a culture and a system of values and beliefs. It is also the means
through which a given society makes productive its own values and
beliefs. Management may well be considered the bridge between a civili-
zation that is rapidly becoming worldwide and a culture which expresses
divergent tradi- tions, values, beliefs, and heritages. Management must
become the instrument through which cultural diversity can be made to
serve the common purposes of mankind. At the same time, management
increasingly is not being practiced within the confines of one national
culture, law, or sovereignty but multi-nationally. Indeed, management is
becom- ing an institution—so far, almost the only one—of a genuine world
economy.</p>
<p>Management, we now know, has to make productive the values,
aspirations, and tradi- tions of individuals, community, and society for
a common productive purpose. If man- agement does not succeed in putting
to work the specific cultural heritage of a country and of a people,
social and economic development is unlikely to take place. This is, of
course, the great lesson of Japan—and the fact that Japan managed, a
century ago, to put to work her own traditions of community and human
values for the new ends of a modern industrialized state explains why
Japan succeeded while every other non-Western country has so far failed.
Management will have to be considered both a science and a humanity,
both a statement of findings that can be objectively tested and
validated, and a system of belief and experience.</p>
<p>Within the individual country, especially the developed country,
business is rapidly losing its exceptional status as we recognize that
it is the prototype of the typical, univer- sal, social form, the
organized institution requiring management. Beyond the national
boundary, however, business is rapidly acquiring the same exceptional
status it no longer has within the individual developed country. Beyond
the national boundary, business is rapidly becoming the exception, and
the one institution which expresses the reality of a world economy and
of a worldwide knowledge society.</p>
<p>We need to learn how to harmonize in one institution and in one
management both the need for managerial unity across national
boundaries, that is, in a common world econ- omy, and the need for
cultural diversity.</p>
<p>Management and the Quality of Life</p>
<p>Because our society is rapidly becoming a society of organizations,
all institutions, in- cluding business, will have to hold themselves
accountable for the quality of life and will have to make fulfillment of
basic social values, beliefs, and purposes a major objective of their
continuing normal activities rather than a social responsibility that
restrains or that lies outside of their normal main functions.
Institutions will have to learn to make the quality of life compatible
with their main tasks. In the business enterprise, this means that the
attainment of the quality of life will have to be considered an
opportunity to be con- verted by management into profitable
business.</p>
<p>This will apply increasingly to fulfillment of the individual. It is
the organization which is today our most visible social environment. The
family is private rather than communal—not that this makes it any less
important. The community is increasingly in the organization. It will be
the job of management to make the individual’s values and aspirations
redound to organizational energy and performance. It will simply not be
good enough to be satisfied—as industrial relations and even human
relations traditionally have been—with satisfaction, that is, with the
absence of discontent. Perhaps one way to dramatize this is to say that
we may, within another ten years, become far less concerned with manager
development as a means of adapting the individual to the demands of the
organization and far more with management development to adapt the
organization to the needs, aspirations, and potential of the
individual.</p>
<p>We also know that management creates economic and social development.
Economic and social development is the result of management.</p>
<p>Japan a hundred years ago was an underdeveloped country by every
material meas- urement. But it very quickly produced management of great
competence, indeed, of excel- lence. Within twenty-five years Meiji
Japan had become a developed country, and, in- deed, in some aspects,
such as literacy, the most highly developed of all countries. We realize
today that it is Meiji Japan—rather than the traditional models of the
economist: eighteenth-century England or nineteenth-century
Germany—which is the model of de- velopment for the underdeveloped
world.</p>
<p>Wherever we have contributed only the economic factors of production,
especially capital, we have not achieved development. In the few cases
where we have been able to generate management energies we have
generated rapid development. Development, in other words, is a matter of
human energies rather than of economic wealth. And the gen- eration and
direction of human energies is the task of management. Management is the
mover and development is a consequence.</p>
<p>More important even than the new tasks, however, may be management’s
new role.</p>
<p>Management is fast becoming the central resource of the developed
countries and the basic need of the developing ones. From being the
specific concern of business, i.e., the economic institution of society,
management and managers are becoming the distinctive organs of developed
society. What management is and what managers do will, there- fore—and
properly—become increasingly a matter of public concern rather than a
matter for the experts. Management will increasingly be concerned as
much with the expression</p>
<p>of basic beliefs and values as with the accomplishment of measurable
results. It will in- creasingly stand for the quality of life of a
society as much as for its standard of living.</p>
<p>There are many new tools of management the use of which we will have
to learn, and many new techniques. There are a great many new and
difficult tasks. But the most im- portant change for management is that
the aspirations and values and the very survival of society in the
developed countries will come to depend on the performance, the compe-
tence, the earnestness, and the values of their managers. The task of
the next generation is to make productive for individual, community, and
society the new organized institutions of our new pluralism. And that
is, above all, the task of management.</p>
<h4 id="the-dimensions-of-management">4 The Dimensions of
Management</h4>
<p>Management Is an Organ—It Exists Only in Contemplation of
Performance—The Three Primary Tasks: Economic Performance; Making Work
Productive and the Worker Achieving; Managing Social Impacts and Social
Responsibilities—The Time Dimensions—Administration and
Entrepreneurship—Efficiency and Effectiveness— Optimization and
Innovation—The Specific Work of Management: Managing Man- agers—Focus on
Tasks</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>usiness enterprises—and public-service institutions as well—are
organs of society. They do not exist for their own sake, but to fulfill
a specific social purpose and to satisfy a specific need of society,
community, or individual. They are not ends in themselves, but means.
The right question to ask in respect to them is not, What are they? but,
What are they supposed to be doing and what are their tasks?</p>
<p>Management, in turn, is the organ of the institution. It has no
function in itself, indeed, no existence in itself. Management divorced
from the institution it serves is not manage- ment.</p>
<p>What people mean by bureaucracy, and rightly condemn, is a management
that has come to misconceive itself as an end and the institution as a
means. This is the degenera- tive disease to which managements are
prone, and especially those managements that do not stand under the
discipline of the market test. To prevent this disease, to arrest it,
and, if possible, to cure it, must be a first purpose of any effective
manager—but also of an effective book on management.</p>
<p>The question, What is management? comes second. First we have to
define manage- ment in and through its tasks.</p>
<p>There are three tasks, equally important but essentially different,
which management has to perform to enable the institution in its charge
to function and to make its contribu- tion:</p>
<p>• the specific purpose and mission of the institution, whether
business enter- prise, hospital, or university;</p>
<p>• making work productive and the worker achieving;</p>
<p>• managing social impacts and social responsibilities.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Purpose and Mission</li>
</ol>
<p>An institution exists for a specific purpose and mission, a specific
social function. In the business enterprise this, means economic
performance.</p>
<p>With respect to this first task, the task of specific performance,
business and non- business institutions differ. In respect to every
other task, they are similar. But only busi- ness has economic
performance as its specific mission. It is the definition of a
business</p>
<p>that it exists for the sake of economic performance. In all other
institutions, hospital, church, university, or armed services, economics
is a restraint. In business enterprise eco- nomic performance is the
rationale and purpose.</p>
<p>A whole section of this book (Chapters 11, 12, 13 and 14) is devoted
to the perform- ance of the non-business, the public-service,
institutions. But the emphasis of this book is on business enterprise
and the task of economic performance. While by no means the only task to
be discharged in society, it is a priority task, because all other
social tasks— education, health care, defense, and the advancement of
knowledge—depend on the sur- plus of economic resources, i.e., profits
and other savings, which only successful eco- nomic performance can
produce. The more of these other satisfactions we want, and the more
highly we value them, the more we depend on economic performance of
business enterprise.</p>
<p>Business management must always, in every decision and action, put
economic per- formance first. It can justify its existence and its
authority only by the economic results it produces. A business
management has failed if it fails to produce economic results. It has
failed if it does not supply goods and services desired by the consumer
at a price the con- sumer is willing to pay. It has failed if it does
not improve, or at least maintain, the wealth-producing capacity of the
economic resources entrusted to it. And this, whatever the economic or
political structure or ideology of a society, means responsibility for
prof- itability. (On the functions of profit see Chapter 6.)</p>
<p>The first definition of business management is that it is an economic
organ, the spe- cifically economic organ of an industrial society. Every
act, every decision, every delib- eration of management, has economic
performance as its first dimension.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Productive Work and Worker Achievement</li>
</ol>
<p>The second task of management is to make work productive and the
worker achieving. Business enterprise (or any other institution) has
only one true resource: man. It performs by making human resources
productive. It accomplishes its performance through work. To make work
productive is, therefore, an essential function. But at the same time,
these institutions in today’s society are increasingly the means through
which individual human beings find their livelihood, find their access
to social status, to community and to indi- vidual achievement and
satisfaction. To make the worker achieving is, therefore, more and more
important and is a measure of the performance of an institution. It is
increas- ingly a task of management.</p>
<p>Organizing work according to its own logic is only the first step.
The second and far more difficult one is making work suitable for human
beings—and their logic is radically different from the logic of work.
Making the worker achieving implies consideration of the human being as
an organism having peculiar physiological and psychological proper-
ties, abilities, and limitations, and a distinct mode of action. It
implies consideration of the human resource as human beings and not as
things, and as having—unlike any other re- source—personality,
citizenship, control over whether they work, how much and how well, and
thus requiring responsibility, motivation, participation, satisfaction,
incentives and rewards, leadership status, and function.</p>
<p>Management, and management alone, can satisfy these requirements. For
workers, whether machine tenders or executive vice-presidents, must be
satisfied through their achievement in work and job—that is, within the
enterprise; and management is the acti- vating organ of the
enterprise.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Social Impacts and Social Responsibilities</li>
</ol>
<p>The third task of management is managing the social impacts and the
social responsibili- ties of the enterprise. None of our institutions
exists by itself and is an end in itself. Every one is an organ of
society and exists for the sake of society. Business is no exception.
Free enterprise cannot be justified as being good for business. It can
be justified only as being good for society.</p>
<p>The first new institution to emerge after antiquity, the first
institution of the West, was the Benedictine monastery of the sixth
century. It was not founded to serve community and society, however. On
the contrary, it was founded to serve exclusively its own mem- bers and
to help them toward their own salvation. Therefore, Saint Benedict
removed his monastery from human society and into the wilderness. He was
not particularly afraid that his monks would yield to the temptations of
the world. He saw a greater danger: that they would be concerned with
the world, take responsibility for it, try to do good, and be forced to
take leadership.</p>
<p>Unlike the Benedictine monastery, every one of our institutions today
exists to con- tribute outside of itself, to supply and satisfy
nonmembers. Business exists to supply goods and services to customers,
rather than to supply jobs to workers and managers, or even dividends to
stockholders. The hospital does not exist for the sake of doctors and
nurses, but for the sake of patients whose one and only desire is to
leave the hospital cured and never come back. The school does not exist
for the sake of teachers, but for the students. For a management to
forget this is mismanagement.</p>
<p>No institution can, therefore, exist outside of community and society
as the Benedic- tine monastery, unsuccessfully, tried. Psychologically,
geographically, culturally, and socially, institutions must be part of
the community.</p>
<p>To discharge its job, to produce economic goods and services, the
business enterprise has to have impacts on people, on communities, and
on society. It has to have power and authority over people, e.g.,
employees, whose own ends and purposes are not defined by and within the
enterprise. It has to have impact on the community as a neighbor, as the
source of jobs and tax revenue, but also of waste products and
pollutants. And, increas- ingly, in our pluralist society of
organizations, it has to add to its fundamental concern for the
quantities of life, i.e., economic goods and services, concern for the
quality of life, that is, for the physical, human, and social
environment of modern man and modern community.</p>
<p>This dimension of management is inherent in the work of managers of
all institutions.</p>
<p>University, hospital, and government agency equally have impacts,
equally have respon- sibilities—and by and large have been far less
aware of them, far less concerned with their human, social, and
community responsibilities than business has. Yet, more and more, we
look to business management for leadership with regard to the quality of
life. Managing social impacts is, therefore, becoming a third major task
and a third major di- mension of management.</p>
<p>These three tasks always have to be done at the same time and within
the same managerial action. It cannot even be said that one task
predominates or requires greater skill or com- petence. True, business
performance comes first—it is the aim of the enterprise and the reason
for its existence. But if work and worker are mismanaged there will be
no business performance, no matter how good the chief executive may be
in managing the business. Economic performance achieved by mismanaging
work and workers is illusory and actu- ally destructive of capital even
in the fairly short run. Such performance will raise costs to the point
where the enterprise ceases to be competitive; it will, by creating
class hatred and class warfare, make it impossible in the end for the
enterprise to operate at all. And, mismanaging social impacts eventually
will destroy society’s support for the enterprise and with it the
enterprise as well.</p>
<p>Each of these three tasks has a primacy of its own. Managing a
business has primacy because the enterprise is an economic institution;
but making work productive and work- ers achieving has importance
precisely because society is not an economic institution and looks to
management for the realization of basic beliefs and values. Managing the
enter- prise’s social impacts has importance because no organ can
survive the body which it serves; and the enterprise is an organ of
society and community.</p>
<p>In these areas also, there are neither actions nor results except of
the entire business (or university, or hospital, or government agency).
There are no “functional” results and no “functional” decisions. There
is only business investment and business risk, business</p>
<p>profit and business loss, business action or business inaction,
business decision and busi- ness information. It is not a plant that
pollutes; it is Consolidated Edison of New York, the Union Carbide
Corporation, the paper industry, or the city’s sewers.</p>
<p>Yet, work and effort are always specific. There is tension,
therefore, between two re- alities: that of performance and that of
work. To resolve this tension, or at least to make it productive, is the
constant managerial task.</p>
<p>The Time Dimension</p>
<p>One complexity is ever-present in every management problem, every
decision, every ac- tion—not, properly speaking, a fourth task of
management, and yet an additional dimen- sion: time.</p>
<p>Management always has to consider both the present and the future;
both the short run and the long run. A management problem is not solved
if immediate profits are purchased by endangering the long-range health,
perhaps even the survival, of the company. A man- agement decision is
irresponsible if it risks disaster this year for the sake of a grandiose
future. The all too common case of the great man in management who
produces startling economic results as long as he runs the company but
leaves behind nothing but a sinking hulk is an example of irresponsible
managerial action and of failure to balance present and future. The
immediate economic results are actually fictitious and are achieved by
paying out capital. In every case where present and future are not both
satisfied, where their requirements are not harmonized or at least
balanced, capital, that is, wealth- producing resource, is endangered,
damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>Today we are particularly conscious of the time dimension in respect
to the long-range impact of short-run economic decisions on the
environment and on natural resources. But the same problem of
harmonizing today and tomorrow exists in all areas, and especially with
respect to people.</p>
<p>The time dimension is inherent in management because management is
concerned with decisions for action. And action always aims at results
in the future. Anybody whose responsibility it is to act—rather than to
think or to know—commits himself to the future.</p>
<p>There are two reasons why the time dimension is of particular
importance in manage- ment’s job, and of particular difficulty. In the
first place, it is the essence of economic and technological progress
that the time span for the fruition and proving out of a decision is
steadily lengthening. Edison, in the 1880s, needed two years or so
between the start of laboratory work on an idea and the start of
pilot-plant operations. Today it may well take Edison’s successors
fifteen years. A half century ago a new plant was expected to pay for
itself in two or three years; today, with capital investment per worker
twenty times that of 1900, the payoff period often runs to ten or twelve
years. A human organization, such as a sales force or a management
group, may take even longer to build and to pay for itself.</p>
<p>The second peculiar characteristic of the time dimension is that
management—almost alone—has to live always in both present and
future.</p>
<p>A military leader, too, knows both times. But traditionally he rarely
had to live in both at the same time. During peace he knew no “present”;
the present was only a preparation for the future war. During war he
knew only the most short-lived “future”; he was con- cerned with winning
the war at hand. Everything else he left to the politicians. That this
is no longer true in an era of cold wars, near wars, and police actions
may be the single most important reason for the crisis of military
leadership and morale that afflicts armed ser- vices today. Neither
preparation for the future nor winning the war at hand will do any
longer; and as a result, the military man has lost his bearings.</p>
<p>But management always must do both. It must keep the enterprise
performing in the present—or else there will be no enterprise capable of
performing in the future. And it has to make the enterprise capable of
performance, growth, and change in the future. Other- wise it has
destroyed capital—that is, the capacity of resources to produce wealth
tomor- row.</p>
<p>The only thing we know about the future is that it is going to be
different. There may be great laws of history, great currents of
continuity operating ever whole epochs. But within time spans of
conscious decision and action—time spans of years rather than cen-
turies—in which the managers of any institution operate, the uncertainty
of the future is what matters. The long-run continuity is not relevant;
and anyhow, it can be discerned only in retrospect and only in
contemplation of history, of how it came out.</p>
<p>For the manager the future is discontinuity. And yet the future,
however different, can be reached only from the present. The greater the
leap into the unknown, the stronger the foundation for the takeoff has
to be. The time dimension endows the managerial decision with its
special characteristics. It is the act in which the manager integrates
present and future.</p>
<p>Administration and Entrepreneurship</p>
<p>There is another dimension to managerial performance. The manager
always has to ad- minister. He has to manage and improve what already
exists and is already known. But he also has to be an entrepreneur. He
has to redirect resources from areas of low or dimin- ishing results to
areas of high or increasing results. He has to slough off yesterday and
to render obsolete what already exists and is already known. He has to
create tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the ongoing business markets, technologies, products, and services
exist. Facilities and equipment are in place. Capital has been invested
and has to be serviced. People are employed and are in specific jobs,
and so on. The administrative job of the manager is to optimize the
yield from these resources.</p>
<p>This, we are usually told, especially by economists, means
efficiency, that is, doing better what is already being done. It means
focus on costs. But the optimizing approach should focus on
effectiveness. It focuses on opportunities to produce revenue, to create
markets, and to change the economic characteristics of existing products
and markets. It asks not, How do we do this or that better? It asks,
which of the products really produce extraordinary economic results or
are capable of producing them? Which of the markets and/or end uses are
capable of producing extraordinary results? It then asks, To what re-
sults should, therefore, the resources and efforts of the business be
allocated so as to pro- duce extraordinary results rather than the
“ordinary” ones which is all efficiency can pos- sibly produce?</p>
<p>This does not deprecate efficiency. Even the healthiest business, the
business with the greatest effectiveness, can well die of poor
efficiency. But even the most efficient busi- ness cannot survive, let
alone succeed, if it is doing the wrong things, that is, if it lacks
effectiveness. No amount of efficiency would have enabled the
manufacturer of buggy whips to survive.</p>
<p>Effectiveness is the foundation of success—efficiency is a minimum
condition for survival after success has been achieved. Efficiency is
concerned with doing things right. Effectiveness is doing the right
things.</p>
<p>Efficiency concerns itself with the input of effort into all areas of
activity. Effective- ness, however, starts out with the realization that
in business, as in any other social organ- ism, 10 or 15 percent of the
phenomena—such as products, orders, customers, markets, or
people—produce 80 to 90 percent of the results. The other 85 to 90
percent of the phe- nomena, no matter how efficiently taken care of,
produce nothing but costs (which are always proportionate to
transactions, that is, to busy-ness).</p>
<p>The first administrative job of the manager is, therefore, to make
effective the very small core of worthwhile activities which is capable
of being effective. At the same time, he neutralizes (if he does not
abandon) the very large penumbra of transactions: products or staff
activities, research work or sales efforts, which, no matter how well
done, will not yield extraordinary high results (whether they represent
the realized opportunities of the past, mere busy-ness, or unfulfilled
hopes and expectations of the past, that is, the mis- takes of
yesterday).</p>
<p>The second administrative task is to bring the business all the time
a little closer to the full realization of its potential. Even the most
successful business works at a low coeffi- cient of performance as
measured against its potential—the economic results that could be
obtained were efforts and resources marshaled to produce the maximum
yield they are inherently capable of.</p>
<p>This task is not innovation; it actually takes the business as it is
today and asks, What is its theoretical optimum? What inhibits
attainment thereof? Where (in other words) are the limiting and
restraining factors that hold back the business and deprive it of the
full return on its resources and efforts?</p>
<p>One basic approach—offered here by way of illustration only—is to ask
the question What relatively minor changes in product, technology,
process, market, and so on, would significantly improve or alter the
economic characteristics and results of this business? (This is similar
to the vulnerability analysis of the modern systems engineers.)</p>
<p>In making steel these vulnerabilities—the factors that hold the
economic results of the steel industry way below the theoretical
potential of industry and process—might, for instance, be the need, in
present steel technology, to create high heats three times, only to
quench them three times. For the most expensive thing to produce are
temperatures, whether heat or cold. In the electrical apparatus business
one vulnerability might well be the habit of public-utility customers to
have each generating turbine designed as if it were a unique product
rather than assembled as one of a large number and according to stan-
dard performance specifications. Another vulnerability might be the
habit of the public- utility customers to order turbines when
money-market rates are low, which then creates expensive fluctuations in
demand and production schedules. If these two habits could be changed,
large generating turbines might well come down 44 to 50 percent in cost.
In life insurance, to give one more example, a central vulnerability
might be the high cost of the individual sale. A way to overcome this
vulnerability and to realize the potential of the business somewhat more
fully might be either statistical selling—elimination of the ex- pensive
personal selling efforts—or enrichment of the sales channel, for
instance, by sell- ing financial planning (including all other
investment instruments, such as investment trust certificates), rather
than only life insurance.</p>
<p>These examples are cited to show that a relatively minor change does
not necessarily have to be easy to make. In fact, we may not know how to
do it. But it is still minor, for the business would remain essentially
as it is now, yet would have different economic results. And while the
illustrations show clearly that these changes may require innova- tion,
they are not, in themselves, innovations. They are primarily
modifications of the existing business.</p>
<p>At the same time, inherent in the managerial task is
entrepreneurship: making the business of tomorrow. Inherent in the task
is innovation.</p>
<p>Making the business of tomorrow starts out with the conviction that
the business of tomorrow will be and must be different. But it also
starts out of necessity—with the busi- ness of today. Making the
business of tomorrow cannot be a flash of genius. It requires systematic
analysis and hard, rigorous work today—and that means by people in
today’s business and operating within it.</p>
<p>The specific job of entrepreneurship in business enterprise is to
make today’s business capable of making the future, of making itself
into a different business. It is the specific job of entrepreneurship in
the going business to enable today’s already existing—and especially
today’s already successful—business to remain existing and to remain
success- ful in the future.</p>
<p>Success cannot, one might say, be continued forever. Businesses are,
after all, crea- tions of man which have no true permanence. Even the
oldest businesses are creations of recent centuries. But a business
enterprise must continue beyond the lifetime of the indi- vidual or of
the generation to be capable of producing its contributions to economy
and to society. The perpetuation of a business is a central
entrepreneurial task—and ability to do so may well be the most trenchant
and definitive test of a management.</p>
<p>The Work of the Manager</p>
<p>Each of these tasks and dimensions has its own skills, its own tools,
its own requirements. But the total management task requires their
integration. And this too requires specific work and its specific tool.
The tool is management; and the work is managing managers.</p>
<p>The tasks—economic performance; making work productive and the worker
achiev- ing; managing social impact and social responsibilities; and
doing all this in a balance between the demands of today and the demands
of tomorrow—are the things in which the public at large has a stake. The
public has no concern with—and only mild interest in— what managers have
to do to accomplish their tasks. It rightly is concerned with perform-
ance. But managers must be concerned with the means to the
accomplishment of their tasks. They must be concerned with managerial
jobs, with the work of the manager, with the skills he needs, and with
his organization.</p>
<p>Any book of management that does not begin with the tasks to be
performed miscon- ceives management. Such a book sees management as
something in itself, rather than as a means to an end. It fails to
understand that management exists only in contemplation of performance.
It treats management as an independent reality, whereas management is an
organ which derives existence, identity, and justification from the
function it serves. The focus must be on the tasks.</p>
<p>To start out discussing management with the work of the manager or
with managerial organization—as most books on management do—is the
approach of the technocrat, who soon degenerates into a bureaucrat. But
it is even poor technocracy. For, as will be stressed again and again in
this book, management work, management jobs, and manage- ment
organization are not absolutes, but are determined and shaped by the
tasks to be performed. “Structure follows strategy” is one of the
fundamental insights we have ac- quired in the last twenty years.
Without understanding the mission, the objectives, and the strategy of
the enterprise, managers cannot be managed, organizations cannot be de-
signed, managerial jobs cannot be made productive.</p>

Sears Story</h4>

Wood and Sears’s Second Phase—Merchandise Planning and Manager
Development—Sears’s Third Phase: From Selling to Buying to
Procurement—Class Markets and Mass Mar- kets—The Challenges Ahead</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>here are hundreds, if not thousands, of books on the management of
the various func- tions of a business—production, marketing, finance,
engineering, purchasing, per- sonnel, public relations, and so forth.
But what it is to manage a business, what man- agement is supposed to do
and how it should be doing it, are subjects which are rarely
discussed.</p>
<p>This oversight is no accident. It reflects the absence of both a
tenable theory of busi- ness enterprise and an adequate discipline of
management. Therefore, rather than theoriz- ing, we shall first look at
the conduct and behavior of an actual business enterprise. There is no
better illustration of what a business is and what managing it means
than one of America’s most successful enterprises: Sears, Roebuck and
Company.</p>
<p>With sales in excess of 0 billion, Sears is the largest retailer in
the world. It is by far the most profitable retail business anywhere and
altogether one of the most profitable companies in the American economy,
by any yardstick. Only Marks andandandand Spencer in Great Britain can
compare with Sears in terms, of success (see Chapter 8). But, Marks
andandandand Spencer is not only much smaller—barely one-tenth of Sears;
it also admittedly owes much of its success, especially in its earlier
years, to imitating Sears.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck has also been a major growth company, even though its
industry, the retail business, is, of course, old and well established,
and totally lacking in the glamour of high technology or scientific
innovation. No other business in America, not even Gen- eral Motors, has
shown such a consistent and sustained growth pattern since before the
turn of this century.</p>
<p>Sears is also a political phenomenon that deserves study. In an age
of consumerism, Sears would seem to be a prime target for consumer
attacks. Yet there has been no or lit- tle criticism. Sears controls,
through majority ownership, or through ownership of a sub- stantial
minority of the stock, the manufacturers of 60 percent of the
merchandise it sells. It would seem a prime target for antitrusters and
a glaring example of concentration of economic power. Yet there has
never been mention of an antitrust investigation of Sears, let alone an
antitrust suit.</p>
<p>The typical case studied in business schools is a case of failure, or
at least of prob- lems. But one can learn more from successes. It is far
more important to know the right thing to do than to know what to avoid
doing.</p>
<p>Sears became a business around the turn of the century with the
realization that the American farmer represented a separate and distinct
market. Separate because of his iso-</p>
<p>lation, which made existing channels of distribution virtually
inaccessible to him; distinct because of his specific needs, which, in
important respects, were different from those of the city consumer.
While the farmer’s purchasing power was individually low, it repre-
sented a tremendous, almost untapped, buying potential in the
aggregate.</p>
<p>To reach the farmer, a new distribution channel had to be created.
Merchandise had to be produced to answer his needs and wants. It had to
be brought to him at low price and with a guarantee of regular supply.
He had to be given a warranty of reliability and hon- esty on the part
of the supplier, since his physical isolation made it impossible for him
to inspect merchandise before delivery or to obtain redress if
cheated.</p>
<p>To create Sears, Roebuck as a business required analysis of customer
and market, and especially of what the farmer considered “value.”
Furthermore, it required major innova- tion in a number of distinct
areas.</p>
<p>First, it demanded systematic “merchandising,” that is, the finding
and developing of sources of supply for the particular goods the farmer
needed in the quality and quantity he needed and at a price he could
pay. Second, it required a mail-order catalog capable of serving as
adequate substitute for the shopping trips to the big city the farmer
could not make. For this reason, the catalog had to become a regular
publication, rather than an announcement of spectacular bargains at
irregular intervals. It had to break with the entire tradition of
selling by mail and learn not to high-pressure the farmer into buying by
exag- gerated claims, but to give him a factual description of the goods
offered. The aim had to be to create a permanent customer by convincing
him of the reliability of the catalog and of the company behind it; the
catalog had to become the “wish book” for the farmer.</p>
<p>Third, the age-old concept of caveat emptor had to be changed to
caveat vendor—the meaning of the famous Sears policy of “your money back
and no questions asked.”* Fourth, a way had to be found to fill large
quantities of customer orders cheaply and quickly. Without the
mail-order plant, conduct of the business would have been physically
impossible.</p>
<p>Finally, a human organization had to be built—and when Sears, Roebuck
started to become a business, most of the necessary human skills were
not available. There were, for instance, no buyers for this kind of
operation, no accountants versed in the new require- ments of inventory
control, no artists to illustrate the catalogs, no clerks experienced in
the handling of a huge volume of customer orders.</p>
<p>Richard Sears gave the company his name. He understood the needs of
the customer; and he brilliantly improvised to satisfy these needs. But
it was not he who made Sears, Roebuck into a business enterprise. In
fact, Richard Sears’s own operations could hardly be called a business.
He was a shrewd speculator, buying up distress-merchandise and offering
it, one batch at a time, through mail advertising. Every one of his
deals was a complete transaction in itself which, when finished,
liquidated itself and the business with it. Sears might have made a lot
of money for himself. But his way of operating could never have founded
a business, let alone perpetuate it. Indeed his success almost bank-
rupted him as it pushed his company far beyond the limit of his
managerial capacity. His company was about to go under when he sold it
to a total outsider, the Chicago clothing merchant Julius Rosenwald
(1862-1932).</p>
<p>Between 1895, when he took control, and 1905, when the Chicago
mail-order plant was opened, Rosenwald made a business enterprise out of
Sears. He analyzed the market, began the systematic development of
merchandise sources, and invented the regular, fac- tual mail-order
catalog and the policy of “satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.”
He built the productive human organization, and gave management people a
maximum of authority and full responsibility for results. Later he gave
every employee an ownership stake in the company, bought for him out of
profits. Rosenwald is the father not only of Sears, Roebuck but of the
distribution revolution which has changed the world economy in the
twentieth century and which is so vital a factor in economic growth.</p>
<p>*Customers, I am given to understand, actually return less
merchandise to Sears than to most of the large American department
stores—it’s the basic policy and what it expresses that makes the
difference.</p>
<p>Only one basic contribution to the early history of Sears was not
made by Rosenwald.</p>
<p>The Chicago mail-order plant was designed by Otto Doering in 1903.
Five years before Henry Ford’s it was the first modern mass-production
plant, complete with the breakdown of all work into simple repetitive
operations, with an assembly line, conveyor belt, stan- dardized,
interchangeable parts—and, above all, with planned plant-wide
scheduling.*</p>
<p>On these foundations, Sears had grown by the end of World War I into
a national in- stitution; its “wish book” was the only literature,
besides the Bible, to be found in many farm homes.</p>
<p>The next phase of the Sears story begins in the mid-twenties. Just as
the first chapter was dominated by one man, Julius Rosenwald, the second
chapter was dominated by an- other, General Robert E. Wood (1879-1969).
When Wood joined Sears, the original Sears market was changing rapidly.
The farmer was no longer isolated; the automobile had enabled him to go
to town and to shop there. He no longer formed a distinct market but
was, largely thanks to Sears, rapidly modifying his way of life and his
standard of living to conform to those of the urban middle class.</p>
<p>At the same time a vast urban market had come into being that was, in
its way, as iso- lated and as badly supplied as the farmer had been
twenty-five years earlier. The low- income groups in the cities had
outgrown both their subsistence standards and their dis- tinct
lower-class habits. They were acquiring the money and the desire to buy
the same goods as the middle and upper classes. The country was rapidly
becoming one big homo- geneous market—but the distribution system was
still one of separate and distinct class markets.</p>
<p>Wood had made this analysis even before he joined Sears. Out of it
came the decision to switch Sears’s emphasis to retail stores—equipped
to serve both the motorized farmer and the city population.</p>
<p>A whole series of innovations had to be undertaken to make this
decision viable. To the finding of sources of supply and to the purchase
of goods from them, merchandising had to add two new major functions:
the design of products and the development of manufacturers capable of
producing these products in large quantity. Class-market prod- ucts—for
instance, refrigerators in the twenties—had to be redesigned for a mass
market with limited purchasing power. Suppliers had to be created—often
with Sears money and Sears-trained management—to produce these goods.
This also required another important innovation: a basic policy for the
relations between Sears and its suppliers, especially those who depended
on the company’s purchases for the bulk of their business. Merchan- dise
planning and research and the systematic building of hundreds of small
suppliers capable of producing for a mass market had to be invented.
They are as basic to mass distribution in Sears’s second phase as mail
order and catalogs were in its first, and they were as distinct a
contribution to the American economy.</p>
<p>Retail selling also meant getting store managers. Mail-order selling
did not prepare a man for the management of a retail store. The greatest
bottleneck for the first ten or fif- teen years of Sears’s retail
operation—almost until World War II—was the shortage of managers. The
most systematic innovations had to be in the field of manager develop-
ment; and the Sears policies of the thirties became the starting point
for all the work in manager development now going on in industry.</p>
<p>Expansion into retail selling also meant radical innovations in
organization structure.</p>
<p>Mail-order selling is highly centralized; retail stores cannot be run
from headquarters two thousand miles away. They must be managed locally.
Only a few mail-order plants were needed to supply the country; Sears
today has over a thousand stores, each with its own market in its own
locality. A decentralized organization structure, methods of managing a
decentralized company, measuring the performance of store managers, and
maintaining corporate unity with maximum local autonomy—all these had to
be devised to make retail</p>
<p>*There is a persistent legend at Sears that Henry Ford before he
built his own first plant visited and carefully studied the then
brand-new Sears mail-order plant.</p>
<p>selling possible. And new compensation policies had to be found to
reward store manag- ers for performance.</p>
<p>Finally, Sears had to innovate in store location, architecture, and
physical arrange- ment. The traditional retail store was unsuited for
the Sears market. It was not just a mat- ter of putting the Sears store
on the outskirts of the city and of providing it with an ade- quate
parking lot. The whole concept of the retail store had to be changed. In
fact, few people even at Sears realize how far this innovation has gone
and how deeply it has influ- enced the shopping habits of the American
people as well as the physical appearance of our towns. The suburban
shopping center which appeared in the fifties as a radical inno- vation
in retail selling is but a logical extension of the concepts and methods
developed by Sears during the thirties.</p>
<p>The basic decisions underlying the expansion into retail stores were
taken in the mid- twenties; the basic innovations had been made by the
early thirties. This explains why Sears’s volume of business and its
profits grew right through the Depression and World War II.</p>
<p>In 1954 General Wood retired, though he retained influence in the
company for an- other ten years. No other long-term dominant chief
executive has emerged to replace him. Since Wood’s retirement Sears has
been run by a small team of men, a chairman, a presi- dent, and an
executive vice-president. Without exception, these members of the top
team retire after five to seven years in office rather than, like
Rosenwald or Wood, holding power for twenty or thirty years.</p>
<p>The changes these successor managements brought about are almost as
profound as those wrought by Rosenwald and Wood. They also redefined
Sears’s business. Under General Wood, Sears was moving from being a
seller to being a buyer. Under his succes- sors, Sears has redefined
itself as a maker for the American family. Increasingly the em- phasis
is on Sears as the informed, responsible producer who designs for the
American family the things it needs and wants. Today Sears’s capital
investment probably centers in the manufacturing plants it owns and
controls—even though retail-store expansion has been pursued
vigorously.</p>
<p>Sears again and again changed the definition of its market in line
with the shifting pat- terns of the American population. Rosenwald made
available mass goods to a new, emerging mass market. Wood made available
to this mass market what earlier had been class-market goods, e.g.,
kitchen appliances. In the last twenty years Sears has shifted to a view
of the American market in which there is no class market any more; it
now operates on the assumption that the American middle class is, in its
economic behavior, actually upper class. Sears has thus greatly widened
its product scope. Of course, Sears still carries appliances in its
stores—and they probably are still the largest-selling product category.
Sears has, however, also become the world’s biggest diamond merchant,
one of the coun- try’s biggest booksellers, and a large buyer and seller
of original art objects, such as draw- ings, prints, and paintings.</p>
<p>General Wood had taken Sears into automobile insurance, which he
rightly considered just as much an automobile accessory as brake lining
or windshield wipers. His succes- sors have added property insurance of
all kinds. They have added a mutual fund to serve the new mass-capital
market. They have gone into the travel business, and so on. In other
words, Sears no longer defines its business as goods. It is defined as
the needs, wants, and satisfactions of the American middle-class
family.</p>
<p>Julius Rosenwald and, far more aggressively, General Wood had moved
into control- ling key manufacturers as the only way to make sure of the
quality Sears needed, of the quantities its tremendous distribution
system required, and of the lowest possible price for the customers.
This is still the rationale given at Sears for ownership or control of
manu- facturing sources. But it would probably be more correct to
describe the source relation- ship of Sears, Roebuck of today as
procurement rather than as buying. The emphasis has steadily shifted
toward a long-range strategy which anticipates what tomorrow’s Ameri-
can family will be and what it will require, and then designs and
develops the appropriate products or services. Sears today may be the
first truly marketing-focused manufacturing</p>
<p>business in the U.S:, practicing what most manufacturing businesses
so far only preach, that is, the total marketing approach. To this
marketing strategy, focused on creating the sources of supply rather
than on selling products to the public, Sears owes both its tre- mendous
growth in sales and its profitability.</p>
<p>Yet Sears today faces new challenges which will require innovation
and strategic thinking fully as much as the developments of the
past.</p>
<p>From the beginning Sears has been keenly aware of basic population
trends in the United States. Wood’s favorite management tool was a
“little black book” full of popula- tion statistics and population
projections. Julius Rosenwald, too, had built his business on population
analysis and population trends. The Sears policy, all along, has been to
find the majority market and to convert it into a true mass market.</p>
<p>There may be a market shift ahead in America, and Sears may not be
strategically po- sitioned for it. By the mid-1970s the young educated
families, whose breadwinners make their living as knowledge workers,
will dominate the American market. Even if Sears can transfer to them
the special relationship it has had with their parents, the blue-collar
workers of the big industrial cities, Sears does not make, buy, or sell
in the areas in which their needs may be greatest and their spending
likely to go up the fastest. Sears is still primarily thing-focused,
primarily a maker, buyer, and seller of manufactured goods. The young
educated families have a healthy appetite for goods; but in their
spending behavior and values, they are upper-upper rather than upper
class, even if their incomes are only average. This means that the major
growth areas in their budgets may not be goods but information and
education, health care, travel and leisure, reliable financial advice
and services, and guidance on job and career choices. These, too, are
wants and needs of the American family; these, too, are areas in which
the American family needs an informed and responsible buyer. But these,
by and large, are not areas in which Sears has estab- lished itself as
the responsible maker and buyer.</p>
<p>Sears, further, has always looked upon its market as homogeneous.
Sears has not been bothered by the fact that minority segments of the
market were not its customers. Neither the very poor nor the very rich
shop at Sears. But it has taken for granted that the bulk of the
population buys the same . merchandise, considers the same things of
value, and alto- gether shares a common economic profile and a common
economic psychology. This may no longer be true. There are signs that
the American market is fragmenting into a number of big segments with
significant differences in buying behavior and economic values be- tween
them. For such a development, Sears would seem to be quite
unprepared.</p>
<p>Sears began in the forties to expand beyond the American frontier,
into Canada, then into Latin America. In the sixties it went into Spain.
It has acquired minority interests in retail stores in other European
countries. There are persistent rumors that it plans to ex- pand into
Japan. But so far, Sears is still an American rather than a
multinational business. It will have to face up to a difficult and risky
decision. If it stays American, it faces the serious possibility of a
steady slowdown in its growth and profitability as non-goods be- come
increasingly important in the family budget of the American middle
class. If it de- cides to become truly multinational, Sears would have
to choose in what countries and markets the Sears mass-marketing
approach can make the greatest contribution. It would then have to think
through what policies—from store design to merchandising to the
structure of the relationship to foreign countries, their governments,
their manufacturers, their investors—this would require. And Sears would
undoubtedly have to learn to apply the same basic approaches and
principles quite differently in different markets and differ- ent
cultures.</p>
<p>If Sears wants to maintain its leadership position and its capacity
to grow, it faces ma- jor new challenges and may have to redefine what
its business is, where its markets are, and where innovations are
needed.</p>
<p>The right answers are always obvious in retrospect. The basic lesson
of the Sears story is that the right answers are likely to be anything
but obvious before they have proven themselves. “Everybody knew” around
1900 that to promise “satisfaction guaranteed or your money back” could
bring only financial disaster to a retailer. “Everybody knew”</p>
<p>around 1925 that the American market was sharply segmented into
distinct income groups, each buying different things in different
places. “Everybody knew”—as late as 1950—that the American consumer
wanted to shop downtown, and so on.</p>
<p>Even more important as a lesson from the Sears story is the knowledge
that the right answers are not the result of brilliance or of
“intuition.” Richard Sears had both—and failed. The right answers are
the result of asking the right questions. And this in turn re- quires
hard, systematic work to understand what a business is and what “our”
business is.</p>

<p>T</p>
<p>HE SEARS STORY SHOWS that a business enterprise is created and
managed by people and not by forces. Economic forces set limits to what
management can do. They create opportunities for management’s action.
But they do not by themselves determine what a business is or what it
does. Nothing could be sillier than the oft-repeated assertion that
“management only adapts the business to the forces of the market.” Man-
agement not only has to find these forces, it has to create them. It
took a Julius Rosenwald seventy-five years ago to make Sears into a
business enterprise, and a General Wood twenty-five years later to
change its basic nature and thus insure its growth and success during
the Depression and World War II. Now another management generation will
have to make new decisions that will determine whether Sears is going to
continue to prosper or to decline, to survive or eventually to perish.
And that is true of every business.</p>
<p>Another conclusion is that a business cannot be defined or explained
in terms of profit. Asked what a business is, the typical businessman is
likely to answer, “An organi- zation to make a profit.” The typical
economist is likely to give the same answer. This answer is not only
false, it is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The prevailing economic theory of business enterprise and behavior,
the maximization of profit—which is simply a complicated way of phrasing
the old saw of buying cheap and selling dear—may adequately explain how
Richard Sears operated. But it cannot ex- plain how Sears, Roebuck or
any other business enterprise operates, nor how it should operate. The
concept of profit maximization is, in fact, meaningless.</p>
<p>Contemporary economists realize this; but they try to salvage the
theorem. Joel Dean, one of the most brilliant and fruitful of
contemporary business economists, still maintains the theorem as such.
But this is how he defines it:</p>
<p>Economic theory makes a fundamental assumption that maximizing
profits is the basic objective of every firm. But in recent years,
profit maximization has been ex- tensively qualified by theorists to
refer to the long run; to refer to management’s</p>
<p>rather than to owners’ income; to include non-financial income such
as increased leisure for high-strung executives and more congenial
relations between executive levels within the firm; and to make
allowance for special considerations such as restraining competition,
maintaining management control, warding off wage de- mands, and
forestalling anti-trust suits. The concept has become so general and
hazy that it seems to encompass most of men’s aims in life.</p>
<p>This trend reflects a growing realization by theorists that many
firms, and par- ticularly the big ones, do not operate on the principle
of profit maximizing in terms of marginal costs and revenues. . . .*</p>
<p>A concept that has “become so general and hazy that it seems to
encompass most of men’s aims in life” is not a concept. It is another
way of saying, “I don’t know and I don’t understand.” A theorem that can
be maintained only when qualified out of existence has surely ceased to
have meaning or usefulness.</p>
<p>The danger in the concept of profit maximization is that it makes
profitability appear a myth. Anyone observing the discrepancy between
the theory of profit maximization and the reality, as portrayed by Joel
Dean, would be justified in concluding that profitability does not
matter—the conclusion actually reached by John Kenneth Galbraith in The
New Industrial State.†</p>
<p>Profit and profitability are, however, crucial—for society even more
than for the indi- vidual business. Yet profitability is not the purpose
of but a limiting factor on business enterprise and business activity.
Profit is not the explanation, cause, or rationale of busi- ness
behavior and business decisions, but the test of their validity. If
archangels instead of businessmen sat in directors’ chairs, they would
still have to be concerned with profitabil- ity, despite their total
lack of personal interest in making profits. This applies with equal
force to those far from angelic individuals, the commissars who run
Soviet Russia’s busi- ness enterprises, and who have to run their
businesses on a higher profit margin than the wicked capitalists of the
West.</p>
<p>The first test of any business is not the maximization of profit but
the achievement of sufficient profit to cover the risks of economic
activity and thus to avoid loss.</p>
<p>The root of the confusion is the mistaken belief that the motive of a
person—the so- called profit motive of the businessman—is an explanation
of his behavior or his guide to right action. Whether there is such a
thing as a profit motive at all is highly doubtful. It was invented by
the classical economists to explain the economic reality which their
the- ory of static equilibrium could not explain. There has never been
any evidence for the existence of the profit motive. We have long since
found the true explanation of the phe- nomena of economic change and
growth which the profit motive was first put forth to explain.</p>
<p>It is irrelevant for an understanding of business behavior, profit,
and profitability whether there is a profit motive or not. That Jim
Smith is in business to make a profit concerns only him and the
Recording Angel. It does not tell us what Jim Smith does and how he
performs. We do not learn anything about the work of a prospector
hunting for uranium in the Nevada desert by being told that he is trying
to make his fortune. We do not learn anything about the work of a heart
specialist by being told that he is trying to make a livelihood, or even
that he is trying to benefit humanity. The profit motive and its
offspring maximization of profits are just as irrelevant to the function
of a business, the purpose of a business, and the job of managing a
business.</p>
<p>In fact, the concept is worse than irrelevant: it does harm. It is a
major cause for the misunderstanding of the nature of profit in our
society and for the deep-seated hostility to profit which are among the
most dangerous diseases of an industrial society. It is largely
responsible for the worst mistakes of public policy—in this country as
well as in Western Europe—which are squarely based on the failure to
understand the nature, function, and</p>
<p>*Joel Dean, Managerial Economics (Prentice-Hall, 1951), p. 28.
†Houghton Mifflin, 1967.</p>
<p>purpose of business enterprise. And it is in large part responsible
for the prevailing belief that there is an inherent contradiction
between profit and a company’s ability to make a social contribution.
Actually, a company can make a social contribution only if it is highly
profitable. To put it crudely, a bankrupt company is not likely to be a
good company to work for, or likely to be a good neighbor and a
desirable member of the community—no matter what some sociologists of
today seem to believe to the contrary.</p>
<p>The Purpose of a Business</p>
<p>To know what a business is we have to start with its purpose. Its
purpose must lie outside of the business itself. In fact, it must be in
society since business enterprise is an organ of society. There is only
one valid definition of business purpose: to create a customer.</p>
<p>Markets are not created by God, nature, or economic forces but by
businessmen. The want a business satisfies may have been felt by the
customer before he was offered the means of satisfying it. Like food in
a famine, it may have dominated the customer’s life and filled all his
waking moments, but it remained a potential want until the action of
businessmen converted it into effective demand. Only then is there a
customer and a mar- ket. The want may have been unfelt by the potential
customer; no one knew that he wanted a Xerox machine or a computer until
these became available. There may have been no want at all until
business action created it—by innovation, by credit, by advertis- ing,
or by salesmanship. In every case, it is business action that creates
the customer.</p>
<p>It is the customer who determines what a business is. It is the
customer alone whose, willingness to pay for a good or for a service
converts economic resources into wealth, things into goods. What the
business thinks it produces is not of first importance— especially not
to the future of the business and to its success. The typical
engineering definition of quality is something that is hard to do, is
complicated, and costs a lot of money! But that isn’t quality; it’s
incompetence. What the customer thinks he is buying, what he considers
value, is decisive—it determines what a business is, what it produces,
and whether it will prosper. And what the customer buys and considers
value is never a product. It is always utility, that is, what a product
or service does for him. And what is value for the customer is, as we
shall see (in Chapter 7), anything but obvious.</p>
<p>The customer is the foundation of a business and keeps it in
existence. He alone gives employment. To supply the wants and needs of a
consumer, society entrusts wealth- producing resources to the business
enterprise.</p>
<p>The Two Entrepreneurial Functions</p>
<p>Because its purpose is to create a customer, the business enterprise
has two—and only these two—basic functions: marketing and innovation.
Marketing and innovation produce results all the rest are “costs.”</p>
<p>Marketing is the distinguishing, unique function of the business. A
business is set apart from all other human organizations by the fact
that it markets a product or a service. Neither church, nor army, nor
school, nor state does that. Any organization that fulfills itself
through marketing a product or a service is a business. Any organization
in which marketing is either absent, or incidental is not a business and
should never be managed as if it were one.</p>
<p>The first man in the West to see marketing clearly as the unique and
central function of the business enterprise, and the creation of a
customer as the specific job of manage- ment, was Cyrus H. McCormick
(1809-1884). The history books mention only that he invented a
mechanical harvester. But he also invented the basic tools of modern
market- ing: market research and market analysis, the concept of market
standing, pricing policies, the service salesman, parts and service
supply to the customer, and installment credit. He had done all this by
1850, but not till fifty years later was he first widely imitated even
in his own country.</p>
<p>In the Far East marketing arose even earlier—also without finding
imitators for a very long time. Marketing was invented in Japan around
1650 by the first member of the Mit-</p>
<p>sui family to settle in Tokyo as a merchant and to open what might be
called the first de- partment store. He anticipated by a full 250 years
basic Sears, Roebuck policies: to be the buyer for his customers; to
design the right products for them, and to develop sources for their
production; the principle of your money back and no questions asked; and
the idea of offering a large assortment of products to his customers
rather than focusing on a craft, a product category, or a process. He
also saw that the social changes in his country at that time had created
a new class of potential customers, an urbanized new gentry and a new
bourgeoisie. On these foundations he and his successors not only built
what is to this day Japan’s largest retail business, the Mitsukoshi
chain of department stores. They also built one of the largest of
Japan’s manufacturing, trading, and financial combines, the Mitsui
Zaibatsu.</p>
<p>The economic revolution of the American economy since 1900 has in
large part been a marketing revolution. Creative, aggressive, pioneering
marketing is still far too rare in American business—few businesses are
even abreast of the Sears of 1925, let alone of the Sears of 1970. Yet
fifty years ago the typical attitude of the American businessman to-
ward marketing was “the sales department will sel1 whatever the plant
produces.” Today it is increasingly, “It is our job to produce what the
market needs.” However deficient in execution, the attitude has by
itself changed our economy as much as any of the technical innovations
of this century.</p>
<p>In Europe selling was not really accepted as a core function of
business until well after World War II. Export sales were highly
valued—a holdover from eighteenth-century mercantilism which considered
domestic consumption to be antisocial but selling abroad highly
patriotic and meritorious (a good bit of this belief still lingers on in
Japan and un- derlies Japanese government attitudes and policies).</p>
<p>But selling was undignified. Before 1914 an export sales manager
could get an offi- cer’s commission in the Prussian Army; he was a
“gentleman.” But a domestic sales man- ager was unacceptable and
despised. As late as 1950 there were big Italian companies whose export
sales managers sat on the board of directors as members of top
management while no one, literally, was responsible for domestic
sales—even though the domestic market accounted for 70 percent of the
company’s business.</p>
<p>This traditional European social prejudice against market, customer,
and selling was, by the way, an important reason for the popularity of
cartels in Europe. No one needs to worry about markets and sales—at
least not in the short run—if an industry divides up the business
through a tidy, tight cartel.</p>
<p>The shift from this attitude to one which considered marketing as a
central business function—though perhaps not yet as the central function
of business—is one of the main reasons for Europe’s explosive recovery
since 1950.</p>
<p>The marketing approach was first introduced into Europe in the
twenties by an English retail chain, Marks andandandand Spencer. Despite
Marks andandandand Spencer’s success—in less than fifteen years, from
1920 to 1935, the firm became Europe’s largest, fastest-growing, and
most profitable retailer—few followed it until well after World War II.
Since then the market- ing revolution has swept Europe—leading
practitioners are such companies as Philips in Holland, Unilever, and
Fiat.</p>
<p>In Japan, similarly, few imitated Mitsui. The marketing revolution in
Japan perhaps did not start until Sony, a brash newcomer, began to
market in the 1950s, first in Japan, then worldwide. Until then most
Japanese businesses were product-oriented rather than market-oriented,
but they learned amazingly fast. The economic success of Japan in the
world markets since the fifties, and with it the Japanese economic
miracle, rests squarely on an acceptance of marketing as the first
function of business and its crucial task.</p>
<p>Marketing, is so basic that it cannot be considered a separate
function (i.e., a separate skill or work) within the business, on a par
with others such as manufacturing or person- nel. Marketing requires
separate work, and a distinct group of activities. But it is, first, a
central dimension of the entire business. It is the whole business seen
from the point of view of its final result, that is, from the customer’s
point of view. Concern and responsi- bility for marketing must,
therefore, permeate all areas of the enterprise.</p>
<p>Among American manufacturing companies the outstanding practitioner
of the mar- keting approach may well be IBM; and IBM is also the best
example of the power of marketing. (See the discussion of IBM’s
near-miss in Chapter 60.) IBM does not owe its meteoric rise to
technological innovation or product leadership. It was a Johnny-come-
lately when it entered the computer field, without technological
expertise or scientific knowledge. But while the technological leaders
in the early computer days, Univac, GE, and RCA, were product-focused
and technology-focused, the punch-card salesmen who ran IBM asked: “Who
is the customer? What is value for him? How does he buy? And, what does
he need?” As a result, IBM took over the market.</p>
<p>From Selling to Marketing</p>
<p>Despite the emphasis on marketing and the marketing approach,
marketing is still rhetoric rather than reality in far too many
businesses. “Consumerism” proves this. For what con- sumerism demands of
business is that it actually market. It demands that business start out
with the needs, the realities, the values of the customer. It demands
that business define its goal as the satisfaction of customer needs. It
demands that business base its reward on its contribution to the
customer. That after twenty years of marketing rhetoric consumerism
could become a powerful popular movement proves that not much marketing
has been practiced. Consumerism is the “shame of marketing.”</p>
<p>But consumerism is also the opportunity of marketing. It will force
businesses to be- come market-focused in their actions as well as in
their pronouncements.</p>
<p>Above all, consumerism should dispel the confusion which largely
explains why there has been so little real marketing. When managers
speak of marketing, they usually mean the organized performance of all
selling functions. This is still selling. It still starts out with “our
products.” It still looks for “our market.” True marketing starts out
the way Sears starts out—with the customer, his demographics, his
realities, his needs, his values. It does not ask, “What do we want to
sell?” It asks, “What does the customer want to buy?” It does not say,
“This is what our product or service does.” It says, “These are the
satisfactions the customer looks for, values, and needs.”</p>
<p>Indeed, selling and marketing are antithetical rather than synonymous
or even com- plementary.</p>
<p>There will always, one can assume, be need for some selling. But the
aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous. The aim of marketing is
to know and understand the cus- tomer so well that the product or
service fits him and sells itself.</p>
<p>Ideally, marketing should result in a customer who is ready to buy.
All that should be needed then is to make the product or service
available, i.e., logistics rather than sales- manship, and statistical
distribution rather than promotion. We may be a long way from this
ideal. But consumerism is a clear indication that the right motto for
business man- agement should increasingly be, “from selling to
marketing.”</p>
<p>The Enterprise as the Organ of Economic Growth and Development</p>
<p>Marketing alone does not make a business enterprise. In a static
economy there are no business enterprises. There are not even
businessmen. The middleman of a static society is a broker who receives
his compensation in the form of a fee, or a speculator who cre- ates no
value.</p>
<p>A business enterprise can exist only in an expanding economy, or at
least in one which considers change both natural and acceptable. And
business is, the specific organ of growth, expansion, and change.</p>
<p>The second function of a business is: therefore, innovation—the
provision of different economic satisfactions. It is not enough for the
business to provide just any economic goods and services; it must
provide better and more economic ones. It is not necessary for a
business to grow bigger; but it is necessary—that it constantly grow
better.</p>
<p>Innovation may result in a lower price—the datum with which the
economist has been most concerned, for the simple reason that it is the
only one that can be handled by quan-</p>
<p>titative tools. But the result may also be a new and better product,
a new convenience, or the definition of a new want.</p>
<p>The most productive innovation is a different product or service
creating a new poten- tial of satisfaction, rather than an improvement.
Typically this new and different product costs more—yet its overall
effect is to make the economy more productive.</p>
<p>The antibiotic drug costs far more than the cold compress which is
all yesterday’s physician had to fight pneumonia. The computer costs far
more than an adding machine or a punch-card sorter, the typewriter far
more than a quill pen, the Xerox duplicator far more than a copy press
or even a mimeograph copier. And, if and when we get a cancer cure, it
will cost more than even a first-class funeral.</p>
<p>The price of the product is thus only one measurement of the value of
an innovation, or of economic process altogether. We may relate price to
unit output, i.e., price of a drug to the saving it produces in days of
hospital stay and in added years of working life. But even that is
hardly adequate. We really need a value measurement. What economic value
does innovation give the customer? The customer is the only judge; he or
she alone knows his (or her) economic reality.</p>
<p>Innovation may be finding new uses for old products. A salesman who
succeeds in selling refrigerators to Eskimos to prevent food, from
freezing would be as much of an innovator as if he had developed
brand-new processes or invented a new product. To sell Eskimos a
refrigerator to keep food cold is finding a new market; to sell a
refrigerator to keep food from getting too cold is actually creating a
new product. Technologically there is, of course, only the same old
product; but economically there is innovation.</p>
<p>Above all, innovation, is not invention. It is a term of economics
rather than of tech- nology. Non-technological innovations—social or
economic innovations—are at least as important as technological ones.
(On this see Chapter 61, “The Innovative Organiza- tion.”)</p>
<p>However important the steam engine was as an invention, two
non-technological in- novations have had as much to do with the rise of
modern economy: the mobilization of purchasing power through bank
credit, and the application of probability mathematics to the physical
risks of economic activity, that is, insurance. The innovation of
limited liabil- ity and the subsequent development of the publicly owned
limited-liability company were of equal importance. And installment
credit (or as the British call it more accurately, hire purchase) has
equal impact. It makes it possible to pay for the means to increase
produc- tion out of the future fruits of the investment. It thus enabled
the American farmer in the nineteenth century to buy the implements that
made him productive and to pay for them after he had obtained the larger
crop at lower cost. And this also makes installment credit a powerful
dynamo of economic development in today’s poor, underdeveloped
countries.</p>
<p>In the organization of the business enterprise innovation can no more
be considered a separate function than marketing. It is not confined to
engineering or research but extends across all parts of the business,
all functions, all activities. It cannot be confined to manu- facturing
business. Innovation in distribution has been as important as innovation
in manufacturing; and so has been innovation in an insurance company or
in a bank.</p>
<p>The leadership in innovation with respect to product and service has
traditionally been focused in one functional activity which is
responsible for nothing else. This has been particularly true for
businesses with heavy engineering or chemical technology. In an in-
surance company, too, a special department charged with leadership
responsibility for the development of new kinds of coverage may be in
order; and there might well be other such departments charged with
innovation in the organization of sales, the administration of policies,
and the settling of claims. Yet another group might work on innovation
in investing the company’s funds. All these are the insurance company’s
business.</p>
<p>But—as discussed in more detail in Chapter 61—the best way to
organize for system- atic, purposeful innovation is as a business
activity rather than as functional work. At the same time, every
managerial unit of a business should have responsibility for innovation
and definite innovation goals. It should be responsible for contributing
to innovation in the company’s product or service; in addition, it
should strive consciously to advance the</p>
<p>art in the particular area in which it is engaged: selling or
accounting, quality control or personnel management.</p>
<p>Innovation can be defined as the task of endowing human and material
resources with new and greater wealth-producing capacity. Innovation is
particularly important for de- veloping countries. These countries have
the resources. They are poor because they lack the capacity to make
these resources wealth-producing. They can import technology. But they
have to produce their own social innovations to make imported technology
work.</p>
<p>To have realized this was the great strength of the founders of
modern Japan a century ago. They deliberately kept their country
dependent on the West’s technology—a de- pendence that remained until
very recently. But they channeled their energies and those of their
people into social innovations that would enable their country to become
a strong modern society and economy and yet retain its distinct Japanese
character and culture.</p>
<p>Innovation is thus crucial to economic development. Indeed, economic
development is, above all, an entrepreneurial task.*</p>
<p>Managers must convert society’s needs into opportunities for
profitable business.</p>
<p>That, too, is a definition of innovation. It needs to be stressed
today, when we are so con- scious of the needs of society, schools,
health-care systems, cities, and environment. These needs are not too
different in kind from those which the nineteenth-century entre- preneur
converted into growth industries—the urban newspaper and the streetcar;
the steel-frame skyscraper and the school textbook; the telephone and
pharmaceuticals. The new needs similarly demand the innovating
business.</p>
<p>The Productive Utilization of Wealth-Producing Resources</p>
<p>The enterprise must utilize wealth-producing resources to discharge
its purpose of creat- ing a customer. It is, therefore, charged with
productive utilization of these resources. This is the administrative
function of business. In its economic aspect it is called produc-
tivity.</p>
<p>Everybody these last few years has been talking productivity. That
greater productiv- ity—better utilization of resources—is both the key
to a high standard of living and the result of business activity is not
news. And everyone knows by now that the scourge of modern economies,
uncontrolled inflation, is a deficiency disease caused by inadequate
productivity. But we actually know very little about productivity; we
are, indeed, not yet able to measure it.</p>
<p>Productivity means that balance between all factors of production
that will give the greatest output for the smallest effort. This is
quite different from productivity per worker or per hour of work; it is
at best distantly and vaguely reflected in such traditional stan-
dards.</p>
<p>These standards are still based on the eighteenth-century tenet that
manual labor is, in the last resort, the only productive resource;
manual work the only real effort. The stan- dards still express the
mechanistic fallacy—of which Marx, to the permanent disability of
Marxian economics, was the last important dupe—that all human
achievement could eventually be measured in units of muscle effort.
Increased productivity in a modern economy is never achieved by muscle
effort. It is always the result of doing away with muscle effort, of
substituting something else for the laborer. One of these substitutes
is, of course, capital equipment, that is, mechanical energy.†</p>
<p>At least as important, though unnoticed until very recently, is the
increase in produc- tivity achieved by replacing manual labor, whether
skilled or unskilled, by knowledge,</p>
<p>*On this see the essay by a South American educator and businessman
Reinaldo Scarpetta, “Management Education as a Key to Social
Development,” in Preparing Tomorrow’s Business Leaders Today, edited by
Peter F. Drucker (Prentice-Hall, 1969).</p>
<p>†Here we now have available the careful studies of Simon Kuznets (of
the University of Pennsylvania and of Harvard) to show the direct
relationship in United States industry between investment in capital
equipment and increases in productivity.</p>
<p>resulting in a shift from laborers to knowledge workers, such as
managers, technicians, and professionals.</p>
<p>A little reflection will show that the rate of capital formation, to
which economists give so much attention, is a secondary factor. Someone
must plan and design the equip- ment—a conceptual, theoretical, and
analytical task—before it can be installed and used. The basic factor in
an economy’s development must be the rate of “brain formation,” the rate
at which a country produces people with imagination and vision,
education, and theo- retical and analytical skills.</p>
<p>However, the planning, design, and installation of capital equipment
is only a part of the increase in productivity through the substitution
of brain for brawn. At least as impor- tant is the contribution made
through the direct change of the character of work from one requiring
the manual labor, skilled and unskilled, of many people, to one
requiring theo- retical analysis and conceptual planning without any
investment in capital equipment.</p>
<p>This contribution first became evident in the 1950s in the analysis
of the productivity gap between American and European industry.
Studies—e.g., by the Stanford Research Institute and by the Organization
for Economic Cooperation (OEC)—showed clearly that the productivity
differential between Western Europe and the United States was not a
matter of capital investment. In many European industries productivity
was as much as two-thirds below that of the corresponding American
industry, even though capital in- vestment and equipment were equal. The
only explanation was the lower proportion of managers and technicians
and the poor organization structure of European industry with its
reliance on manual skill.</p>
<p>In 1900 the typical manufacturing company in the United States spent
probably no more than or on managerial, technical, and professional
personnel for every 00 in direct-labor wages. Today there are many
manufacturing industries where the two items of expenditure are
equal—even though direct-labor wage rates have risen proportionately
much faster. Outside of manufacturing, transportation, and mining, e.g.,
in distribution, finance, insurance, and the service industries (that
is, in two-thirds of the American econ- omy), the increase in
productivity has been caused primarily by the replacement of labor by
planning, brawn by brain, sweat by knowledge.</p>
<p>The greatest opportunities for increasing productivity are surely to
be found in knowl- edge work itself, and especially in management. The
vocabulary of business—especially of accounting—in relation to
productivity has become so obsolete as to be misleading. What the
accountant calls productive labor is manual workers tending machines,
who are actually the least productive labor. What he calls nonproductive
labor—all the people who contribute to production without tending a
machine—is a hodgepodge. It includes pre-industrial, low-productivity
brawn labor like sweepers; some traditional high-skill,
high-productivity labor like toolmakers; new industrial high-skill labor
like maintenance electricians; and industrial high-knowledge personnel
like firemen, industrial engineers, and quality control men. Finally,
what the accountant lumps together as overhead—the very term reeks of
moral disapproval—contains what should be the most productive re-
source, the managers, researchers, planners, designers, innovators. It
may also, however, contain purely parasitical, if not destructive,
elements in the form of high-priced person- nel needed only because of
mal-organization, poor spirit, or confused objectives, that is, because
of mismanagement.</p>
<p>We need a concept of productivity that considers together all the
efforts that go into output and expresses them in relation to their
result, rather than one that assumes that la- bor is the only productive
effort. But even such a concept—though a big step forward— would still
be inadequate if its definition of effort were confined to the
activities measur- able as visible and direct costs, that is, according
to the accountant’s definition of, and symbol for, effort. There are
factors of substantial if not decisive impact on productivity that never
become visible cost figures.</p>
<p>First there is knowledge—man’s most productive resource if properly
applied, but also the most expensive one and totally unproductive, if
misapplied. The knowledge</p>
<p>worker is, of necessity, a high-cost worker. Having spent many years
in school, he also represents a very high social investment</p>
<p>Then there is time—man’s most perishable resource. Whether men and
machines are utilized steadily or only half the time will make a
difference in their productivity. There is nothing less productive than
idle time of expensive capital equipment or wasted time of high1y paid
and able people. Equally unproductive may be cramming more productive
effort into time than it will comfortably hold—for instance, the attempt
to run three shifts in a congested plant or on old or delicate
equipment.</p>
<p>The most productive—or least productive—time is that of the manager
himself. Yet it is usually the least known, least analyzed, least
managed of all factors of productivity.*</p>
<p>Productivity is also a function or the product mix, the balance
between various combi- nations of the same resources. As every manager
should know, differentials in the market values of various combinations
are rarely proportional to the efforts that go into making up the
combinations. Often there is barely any discernible relationship between
the two. A company turning out a constant volume of goods with
unchanging materials and skills requirements and a constant amount of
direct and indirect labor may reap fortunes or go bankrupt, depending on
the product mix. Obviously this represents a considerable differ- ence
in the productivity of the same resources—but not one that shows in
costs or can be detected by cost analysis.</p>
<p>There is also an important factor which I would call “process mix.”
Is it more produc- tive for a company to buy a part or to make it, to
assemble its product or to contract out the assembly process, to market
under its own brand name through its own distributive organization or to
sell to independent wholesalers using their own brands? What is the
company good at? What is the most productive utilization of its specific
knowledge, abil- ity, experience, reputation?</p>
<p>Not every management can do everything, nor should any business
necessarily go into those activities which seem objectively to be most
profitable. Every management has spe- cific abilities and limitations.
Whenever it attempts to go beyond these, it is likely to fail, no matter
how inherently profitable the venture.</p>
<p>People who are good at running a highly stable business will not be
able to adjust to a mercurial or a rapidly growing business. People who
have grown up in a rapidly expand- ing company will, as everyday
experience shows, be in danger of destroying the business should it
enter upon a period of consolidation. People good at running a business
with a foundation in long-range research are not likely to do well in
high-pressure selling of novelties or fashion goods. Utilization of the
specific abilities of the company and its management and observance of
these specific limitations is an important productivity factor.
Conglomerates may optimize the productivity of capital, but they will
have rather low productivity—and inherently poor results—in other
equally important areas.</p>
<p>Finally, productivity is vitally affected by organization structure
and by the balance among the various activities within the business. If
a lack of clear organization causes managers to waste their time trying
to find out what they are supposed to do rather than doing it, the
company’s scarcest resource is being wasted. If top management is
interested only in engineering (perhaps because that’s where all the top
men came from) while the company needs major attention to marketing, it
lacks productivity; the resulting damage will be greater than could be
caused by a drop in output per man-hour. These factors are additional to
the factors accountants and economists usually consider, namely,
productiv- ity of labor, capital, and materials. They are, however,
fully as important.</p>
<p>We therefore not only need to define productivity so as to embrace
all these factors af- fecting it, but also need to set objectives that
take all these factors into account. We must develop yardsticks to
measure the impact on productivity of the substitution of capital for
labor, and of knowledge for both—and means to distinguish between
creative and para- sitical overhead, and to assess the impact on
productivity of time utilization, product mix, process mix, organization
structure, and the balance of activities.</p>
<p>*On this see my book, The Effective Executive (1966), especially
Chapter l.</p>
<p>Not only does individual management need adequate concepts and
measurements for productivity, the economy needs them. Their lack is the
biggest gap in our economic sta- tistics and seriously weakens all
economic policy. It frustrates our attempts to fight de- pression and
inflation alike.</p>
<p>The Functions of Profit</p>
<p>Profit is not a cause but a result—the result of the performance of
the business in market- ing, innovation, and productivity. It is a
needed result, serving essential economic func- tions. Profit is, first,
the test of performance—the only effective test, as the communists in
Russia soon found out when they tried to abolish it in the early
twenties (though they coyly called it the capital fund and avoided the
bad word profit until well into the 1950s). Indeed, profit is a
beautiful example of what engineers mean when they talk of the feed-
back such as underlies all systems of automated production: the
self-regulation of a proc- ess by its own results.</p>
<p>Profit has a second function which is equally important. It is the
premium for the risk of uncertainty. Economic activity, because it is
activity, focuses on the future; and the one thing that is certain about
the future is its uncertainty, its risks. The word “risk” itself is said
to mean “earning one’s daily bread” in the original Arabic. It is
through risk-taking that any businessman earns his daily bread. Because
business activity is economic it al- ways attempts to bring about
change. It always saws off the limb on which it sits; it makes existing
risks riskier or creates new ones.</p>
<p>As the Sears story showed, the future of economic activity is a long
one; it took fifteen or twenty years for basic Sears decisions to become
fully effective, and for major invest- ments to pay off. “Lengthening
the economic detour” has been known for a hundred years to be a
prerequisite to economic advance. Yet while we know nothing about the
future, we know that its risk increase in geometric progression the
farther ahead we commit our- selves to it.</p>
<p>Profit and profit alone can supply the capital for tomorrow’s jobs,
both for more jobs and for better jobs. Again it is a definition of
economic progress that the investment needed to create new and
additional jobs increases.</p>
<p>Today’s accountant or engineer does not make a better living than his
grandfather on the farm because he works harder. He works far less hard.
Nor does he deserve a better living because he is a better man. He is
the same kind of human being as grandfather was, and grandfather’s
grandfather before him. He can be paid so much more and yet work so much
less hard because the capital investment in him and his job is
infinitely greater than that which financed his grandfather’s job. In
1900, when grandfather started, capital in- vestment per American farmer
was at most ,000. To create the accountant’s or engi- neer’s job,
society first invests at least 0,000 in capital and expenses for school
and education. And then the employer invests another 5,000 to 0,000 per
job. All of this investment that makes possible both additional and
better jobs has to come out of the sur- plus of economic activity, that
is, out of profits.</p>
<p>And finally profit pays for the economic satisfactions and services
of a society, from health care to defense, and from education to the
opera. They all have to be paid for out of the surplus of economic
production, that is, out of the difference between the value produced by
economic activity and its cost.</p>
<p>Businessmen these days tend to be apologetic about profit. This is a
measure of the dismal job they have done explaining profit—above all to
themselves. For there is no justification and no rationale for profit as
long as one talks the nonsense of profit motive and profit
maximization.</p>
<p>No apology is needed for profit as a necessity of economy and
society. On the con- trary, what a businessman should feel guilty about,
what he should feel the need to apolo- gize for, is failure to produce a
profit appropriate to the economic and social functions which profit,
and only profit, can develop.</p>
<p>Walter Rathenau (1867-1922), the German executive, statesman, and
social philoso- pher, who thought more deeply than any other Westerner
of his time about the social re- sponsibility of business, proposed
replacing the word profit with responsibility. Profit, to be sure, is
not the whole of business responsibility; but it is the first
responsibility. The business that fails to produce an adequate profit
imperils both the integrity of the re- sources entrusted in its care and
the economy’s capacity to grow. It is untrue to its trust.</p>
<p>At the very least, business enterprise needs a minimum of profit: the
profit required to cover its own future risks, the profit required to
enable it to stay in business and to main- tain intact the
wealth-producing capacity of its resources. This required minimum profit
affects business behavior and business decision—both by setting limits
and by testing their validity. Management, in order to manage, needs a
profit objective at least equal to the required minimum profit, and
yardsticks to measure its profit performance against this requirement.
(For further discussion see Chapters 8 and 9.)</p>
<p>What, then, is managing a business? It follows from the analysis of
business activity as the creation of a customer through marketing and
innovation that managing a business must always be entrepreneurial in
character. There is need for administrative perform- ance. But it
follows the entrepreneurial objectives. Structure, follows strategy.</p>
<p>It also follows that managing a business must be a creative rather
than an adaptive task. The more a management creates economic conditions
or changes them rather than passively adapts to them, the more it
manages the business.</p>
<p>But an analysis of the nature of a business also shows that
management, while ulti- mately tested by performance alone, is a
rational activity. Concretely this means that a business must set
objectives that express what is desirable of attainment rather than (as
the maximization-of-profit theorem implies) aim at accommodation to the
possible. Once objectives have been set by fixing one’s sights on the
desirable, the question can be raised what concessions to the possible
have to be made. This requires management to decide what business the
enterprise is engaged in, and what business it should be engaged in.</p>

<p>VERY Medici</p>
<p>ONE OF THE GREAT BUSINESS BUILDERS WE KNOW OF—from the and the
founders of the Bank of England down to IBM’s Thomas Watson in</p>
<p>our day—had a definite idea, had, indeed, a clear theory of the
business which in- formed his actions and decisions. A clear, simple,
and penetrating theory of the business rather than intuition
characterizes the truly successful entrepreneur, the man who not just
amasses a large fortune but builds an organization that can endure and
grow long after he is gone.</p>
<p>The individual entrepreneur does not need to analyze his concepts and
explain his theory of the business to others, let alone spell out the
details. He is in one person thinker, analyst, and executor. Business
enterprise, however, requires that the theory of the busi- ness be
thought through and spelled out. It demands a clear definition of
business purpose and business mission. It demands asking, “What is our
business and what should it be?”</p>
<p>Unlike the single entrepreneur, business enterprise requires
continuity beyond the life span of a man or of any one generation. It
cannot, like the merchant-adventurer of old, engage in one venture at a
time which is fully liquidated before the next venture is begun. It has
to commit resources to an ever-longer future; it is in itself the result
of commit- ments of the past and has, therefore, commitments to the past
and to the future—an estab- lished organization, established policies,
past decisions, investments, facilities, products, markets, and above
all, people. Unless grounded in a theory of the business, these com-
mitments cannot be made rationally. They are bound to splinter
resources. And unless grounded in a theory of the business, these
commitments cannot be reviewed and revised rationally. There is no way
to determine that a change is needed unless results can be held against
expectations derived from such a theory of the business.</p>
<p>Today’s theory of the business always becomes obsolete—and usually
pretty fast.</p>
<p>Unless the basic concepts on which a business has been built are,
therefore, visible,</p>
<p>clearly understood, and explicitly expressed, the business enterprise
is at the mercy of events. Not understanding what it is, what it
represents, and what its basic concepts, val- ues, policies, and beliefs
are, it cannot rationally change itself. How rapidly even the most
brilliant entrepreneurial idea can obsolesce the history of Henry Ford
shows—with only fifteen years between an entrepreneurial idea that
literally transformed economy and soci- ety and its obsolescence. (See
Chapter 29, “Why Managers?”)</p>
<p>Only a clear definition of the mission and purpose of the business
makes possible clear and realistic business objectives. It is the
foundation for priorities, strategies, plans, and work assignments. It
is the starting point for the design of managerial jobs and, above all,
for the design of managerial structures. Structure follows strategy.
Strategy determines what the key activities are in a given business. And
strategy requires knowing “what our business is and what it should
be.”</p>
<p>The Fallacy of the Unternehmer</p>
<p>Insofar as the literature of management and economics has paid
attention to the theory of the business, it has dealt with it as a need
of the man at the top—or at most of a small top- management group.</p>
<p>The German tradition is most explicit on this point. The Unternehmer,
that is, the top man and especially the owner-manager, alone knows what
the business is all about and alone makes entrepreneurial decisions.
Everybody else is essentially a technician who carries out prescribed
tasks. No one but the Unternehmer needs to understand the mission and
purpose of the business. Indeed, no one really should know and
understand; Unternehmertum—entrepreneurship—is a mystique that better be
kept hidden from the uninitiated, i.e., ordinary managers and
professionals.</p>
<p>While only the Germans have formalized the traditional concept, it is
subconsciously assumed by top-management people everywhere in the West
(though not in Japan). This may have been adequate in the nineteenth
century business in which there were a few men at the top who alone made
decisions, with all the rest manual workers or low-level clerks. It is a
dangerous misconception of today’s business enterprise.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to the organizations of the past, today’s business
enterprise (but also today’s hospital or government agency) brings
together a great many men of high knowl- edge and skill, at practically
every level of the organization. But high knowledge and skill also mean
decision-impact on how the work is to be done and on what work is
actually being tackled. They make, by necessity, risk-taking decisions,
that is, business decisions, whatever the official form of organization.
And the computer does not alter this fact. In fact, it makes the
decisions of top management even more dependent on the decision input
from lower levels—which is what then becomes the data of the
computer.</p>
<p>When the computer first came in, in the early fifties, we heard a
good deal about the imminent disappearance of the middle manager.
Instead, the fifties and sixties brought in all developed countries a
tremendous growth of middle managers. And, unlike traditional middle
managers, the new middle people are largely decision-makers rather than
execu- tors of decisions made on high. (On this see Chapter 35, “From
Middle Management to Knowledge Organization.”)</p>
<p>As a result, decisions affecting the entire business and its capacity
to perform are made at all levels of the organization, even fairly low
ones. Risk-taking decisions—what to do and what not to do; what to
continue work on and what to abandon; what products, markets, or
technologies to pursue with energy and what markets, products and
technolo- gies to ignore—are in the reality of today’s business
enterprise (especially the large one) made every day by a host of people
of subordinate rank, very often by people without traditional managerial
title or position, e:g., research scientists, design engineers, product
planners, and tax accountants.</p>
<p>Every one of these men bases his decisions on some, if only vague,
theory of the busi- ness. Every one makes assumptions regarding reality,
both inside and outside the busi- ness. Every one assumes that certain
kinds of results are wanted and that other kinds are</p>
<p>not particularly desirable. Every one knows, e.g., that “lowering the
price of our product does not create new demand,” or that “we do this”
but “do not do that.” Every one, in other words, has his answer to the
question “What is our business and what should it be?” Unless,
therefore, the business itself—and that means its top management—has
thought through the question and formulated the answer—or answers—to it,
the decision-makers in the business, all the way up and down, will
decide and act on the basis of different, incompatible, and conflicting
theories of the business. They will pull in different direc- tions
without even being aware of their divergences. But they will also decide
and act on the basis of wrong and misdirecting theories of the
business.</p>
<p>Common vision, common understanding, and unity of direction and
effort of the entire organization require definition of “what our
business is and what it should be.”</p>
<p>“What Is Our Business?”—Never Obvious</p>
<p>Nothing may seem simpler or more obvious than to know what a
company’s business is. A steel mill makes steel, a railroad runs trains
to carry freight and passengers, an insur- ance company underwrites fire
risks, a bank lends money. Actually, “What is our busi- ness?” is almost
always a difficult question and the right answer is usually anything but
obvious.</p>
<p>One of the earliest and most successful answers was worked out by
Theodore N. Vail (1845-1920) for the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company (also known as the Bell System) almost seventy years ago: “Our
business is service.” This sounds obvious once it has been said. But
first there had to be the realization that a telephone system, be- ing a
natural monopoly, was susceptible to nationalization and that a
privately owned telephone service in a developed and industrialized
country was exceptional and needed community support or its survival.
Second, there had to be the realization that community support could not
be obtained by propaganda campaigns nor by attacking critics as “un-
American” or “socialistic.” It could be obtained only by creating
customer satisfaction. This realization meant radical innovations in
business policy. It meant constant indoctri- nation in dedication to
service for all employees, and public relations which stressed ser-
vice. It meant emphasis on research and technological leadership, and it
required financial policy which assumed that the company had to give
service wherever there was a demand, and that it was management’s job to
find the necessary capital and to earn a return on it. The United States
would hardly have gone through the New Deal period without a serious
attempt at telephone nationalization but for the careful analysis of its
own business that the Telephone Company made between 1905 and 1915.</p>
<p>Vail’s definition served his company for two-thirds of a century, up
into the late 1960s; it may have been the longest-lived answer to the
question “What is our business?” That the American railroads never
thought their way through to any definition of their business is surely
a major reason for the perpetual crisis in which they have floundered
since World War I, and for the almost complete lack of community support
that is their greatest weakness.</p>
<p>In retrospect all of Vail’s answers were obvious, if not trite. But
not only did it take years to work them out, each was heresy when first
propounded and bitterly resisted throughout the company. Vail was fired
from his position as general manager in the late 1890s when he dared
propose to his top management that the question “What is our busi-
ness?” be asked. He was called back, a decade later, when the
consequences of the lack of an answer had become painfully evident—that
is, when the Bell System, operating with- out clear definition of its
mission and purpose, had drifted into severe crisis and was threatened
by government takeover.</p>
<p>The answer to the question “What is our business?” is the first
responsibility of top management. Indeed, one sure way to tell whether a
particular job is top management or not is to ask whether its holder is
expected to be concerned with, and responsible for, an- swering this
question. Only top management can make sure that this question receives
the</p>
<p>attention it deserves and that the answer makes sense and enables the
business to plot its course and set its objectives.</p>
<p>That business purpose and business mission are so rarely given
adequate thought is perhaps the most important single cause of business
frustration and business failure. Con- versely, in outstanding
businesses such as the Telephone Company or Sears, success al- ways
rests to a large extent on raising the question “What is our business?”
clearly and deliberately, and on answering it thoughtfully and
thoroughly.</p>
<p>But there are reasons why managements shy back from asking the
question; the first is that the question causes controversy, argument,
and disagreement.</p>
<p>To raise the question always reveals cleavages and differences within
the top- management group itself. People who have worked side by side
for many years and who think that they know each other’s thoughts
suddenly realize with a shock that they are in fundamental
disagreement.</p>
<p>The Need for Dissent</p>
<p>Most managements shrink back from these disagreements as divisive and
painful. But deciding “What is our business?” is a genuine decision; and
a genuine decision must be based on divergent views to have a chance to
be a right and an effective decision. (See Chapter 37, “The Effective
Decision.”) The answer to the question “What is our busi- ness?” is
always a choice between alternatives each of which rests on different
assump- tions regarding the reality of the business and its environment.
It is always a high-risk decision. It always leads to changes in
objectives, strategies, organization, and behavior.</p>
<p>This is far too important a decision to be made by acclamation. In
the end there must, of course, be a decision. But it must be a decision
based on conscious choice of alterna- tives rather than on suppression
of different and dissenting opinions and points of view.</p>
<p>Indeed, to bring these dissents out into the open is in itself
salutary. It is a big step to- ward management effectiveness. It enables
the top-management group to work together precisely because each member
is cognizant of fundamental differences within the group, and,
therefore, far more likely to understand what motivates his colleagues
and what ex- plains their behavior. Conversely, hidden or
half-understood disagreements on the defini- tion of one’s business
underlie many of the personality problems, communication prob- lems, and
irritations that tend to divide a top-management group.</p>
<p>The main reason why it is important to bring out dissents within the
top-management group on the question “What is our business?” is that
there is never one right answer. The answer never emerges as a logical
conclusion from postulates or from “facts.” It requires judgment and
considerable courage. The answer rarely follows what “everybody knows.”
It should never be made on plausibility alone, never be made fast, never
be made painlessly.</p>
<p>Method Rather Than Opinions</p>
<p>Another reason why managements fail to ask “What is our business?” is
their reluctance to listen to opinions. And everyone has an opinion on
“what our business is.” Manage- ments, however, quite rightly dislike
debating societies and bull sessions.</p>
<p>There is need for a method for defining “what our business is.”
Opinions are, of course, needed—and anyhow are unavoidable. But they
need to be focused on a specific, central issue to become
productive.</p>
<p>With respect to the definition of business purpose and business
mission, there is only one such focus, one starting point. It is, the
customer. The customer defines the business.</p>
<p>A business is not defined by the company’s name, statutes, or
articles of incorpora- tion. It is defined by the want the customer
satisfies when he buys a product or a service. To satisfy the customer
is the mission and purpose of every business. The question “What is our
business?” can therefore be answered only by looking at the business
from the out- side from the point of view of customer and market. What
the customer sees, thinks, be- lieves, and wants, at any given time,
must be accepted by management as an objective fact</p>
<p>and must be taken as seriously as the reports of the salesman, the
tests of the engineer, or the figures of the accountant. And management
must make a conscious effort to, get an- swers from the customer himself
rather than attempt to read his mind.</p>
<p>Management always, and understandably, considers its product or its
service to be im- portant. If it did not, it could not do a good job.
Yet to the customer, no product or ser- vice, and certainly no company,
is of much importance. The executives of a company always tend to
believe that the customer spends hours discussing their products. But
how many housewives, for instance, ever talk to each other about the
whiteness of their laun- dry? If there is something badly wrong with one
brand of detergent they switch to another. The customer only wants to
know what the product or service will do for him tomorrow. All he is
interested in are his own values, his own wants, his own reality. For
this reason alone, any serious attempt to state “what our business is”
must start with the customer, his realities, his situation, his
behavior, his expectations, and his values.</p>
<p>Who Is The Customer?</p>
<p>“Who is the customer?” is the first and the crucial question in
defining business purpose and business mission. It is not an easy, let
alone an obvious question. How it is being an- swered determines, in
large measure, how the business defines itself.</p>
<p>The consumer, that is, the ultimate user of a product or a service is
always a customer.</p>
<p>But he is never the customer; there are usually at least
two—sometimes more. Each cus- tomer defines a different business, has
different expectations and values, buys something different. Yet, all
customers have to be satisfied in the answer to the question “What is
our business?”</p>
<p>The power of the question “Who is the customer?” and the impact of a
thoughtful an- swer to it are shown by the experience of the carpet
industry in the United States since World War II.</p>
<p>The carpet industry is an old one, with little glamour and little
sophisticated technol- ogy. Yet it was a conspicuous marketing success
in the American economy of the post- World War II period. For thirty
years, until well into the early fifties, the industry had been in a
steady, long-term, and apparently irreversible decline. Then, within a
few years, the industry completely reversed the trend. Even “good”
houses built before the fifties had, as a rule, no more than a cheap rug
in the living room. Today, even low-cost homes—including most mobile
homes—have wall-to-wall carpeting of fair quality in all rooms, kitchen
and bathrooms included. And the home buyer is spending an increasing
share of his housing dollar on carpeting.</p>
<p>Floor covering is one of the very few means to alter the appearance
and comfort of a home, especially of a cheap and small one. This message
had been broadcast by the rug and carpet manufacturers for decades,
without the slightest effect on actual customer be- havior. The rug and
carpet industry achieved its success only when it stopped persuasion and
hard selling, and instead thought through the questions “Who is our
customer and who should he be?”</p>
<p>Traditionally the rug and carpet manufacturer had defined his
customer as the home- owner, and especially as the family buying its
first home. But at that stage, the young couple has no money left over
for luxuries. They postpone buying rugs—and this means they are not
likely to buy them at all. The industry realized, as a result of asking
“Who is our customer, and who should he be?” that it must succeed in
making the mass builder its customer. It therefore had to make it
profitable for the mass builder to incorporate rugs and carpets into the
new home at the time of building. This meant switching from selling
individual rugs and carpets to selling wall-to-wall carpeting. In the
traditional home the builder had to lay expensive and fully finished
floors. Wall-to-wall carpeting can be put over cheap and unfinished
flooring—resulting in a better house at lower cost to the builder.</p>
<p>The industry further realized that it must enable the new homeowner
to pay for floor covering as part of the monthly payment on the
mortgage, rather than expecting him to</p>
<p>pay a substantial sum at a time when he is already short of cash. It
therefore worked hard at getting the lending agencies, and especially
the government agencies insuring home mortgages (such as the Federal
Housing Administration), to accept floor covering as part of the capital
investment in the house and thus as part of the mortgage value. Finally,
the industry redesigned its product to enable the building contractor to
act as the informed buyer for his customer, the homeowner. Today home
buyers are offered a great variety of patterns and colors, but
essentially only three qualities: “good,” “better,” and “best.” The
difference among them amounts to very little in the monthly mortgage
payment, with the result that most homeowners order at least the
“better” carpeting.</p>
<p>As this story shows, the right answer to the question “Who is the
customer?” is usually that there are several customers.</p>
<p>Most businesses have at least two. The rug and carpet industry has
both the contractor and the homeowner for its customers. Both have to
buy if there is to be a sale. The manu- facturers of branded consumer
goods always have two customers at the very least: the housewife and the
grocer. It does not do much good to have the housewife eager to buy if
the grocer does not stock the brand. Conversely, it does not do much
good to have the grocer display merchandise advantageously and give it
shelf space if the housewife does not buy.</p>
<p>Some businesses have two customers unconnected with each other. The
business of an insurance company can be defined as selling insurance.
But an insurance company is also an investor. In fact, it can well be
defined as a channel that conducts the savings of the community into
productive investments. An insurance company needs two definitions of
its business, as it has to satisfy two separate customers. Similarly, a
commercial bank needs both depositors and borrowers. It cannot be in
business without either. Both, even if they are the same person or the
same business, have different expectations and define the business of
the bank completely differently. To satisfy only one of these customers
with- out satisfying the other means that there is no performance.</p>
<p>One of the great strengths of Vail’s definition of Bell Telephone’s
business was the acceptance in it of two separate customers: the
telephone subscriber and the regulating agencies of the various state
governments. Both had to be given service. Both had to be satisfied.
Yet, they had widely different concepts of value, wanted and needed
different things, and behaved quite differently.</p>
<p>There are also businesses in which economically there is only one
customer while strategically—in terms of buying decision—there are two
or more.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why IBM has been so successful in the computer
business is that it realized early that entirely different people in a
company have to buy a computer if there is to be a sale. The people who
use the computer (which largely means accounting and financial people)
have to buy it. But top management also has to buy. And so do the peo-
ple who are to use the computer as their information tool, that is,
operating managers. From the beginning, therefore, IBM has sold all
these groups and has thought through what each looks for, needs to know,
considers value, and how each can be reached.</p>
<p>Practically everyone who makes and sells equipment faces a similar
situation. While the paper company pays the bill, the process engineer
in the paper mill, the paper chemist in the laboratory, and the
purchasing agent are all separate customers, each buying some- thing
different when they buy the same equipment or the same chemicals; each,
above all, buying in different ways and reached through different
channels.</p>
<p>It is also important to ask “Where is the customer?” One of the
secrets of Sears’s suc- cess—in the 1920s was the discovery that its old
customer was now in a different place: the farmer had become mobile and
was beginning to buy in town. This made Sears realize early—almost two
decades before most other American retailers—that store location is a
major business decision and a major element in answering the question
“What is our business?” American leadership in international banking in
the last twenty years is not primarily the result of superior resources.
It is largely the result of asking, “Where is the customer?” As soon as
the question was asked, it became clear that the old customers, the
American corporations, were going multinational and had to be served
from a multitude</p>
<p>of locations all over the world rather than from New York or San
Francisco headquarters. The resources for serving the new multinational
customers did not come from the United States but from the international
market itself, and, above all, from Europe and the Euro- dollar
market.</p>
<p>The next question is, “What does the customer buy?”</p>
<p>The Cadillac people say that they make an automobile, and their
business is called the Cadillac Motor Division of General Motors. But
does the man who spends ,000 on a new Cadillac buy transportation, or
does he buy primarily prestige? Does the Cadillac compete with
Chevrolet, Ford, and Volkswagen? Nicholas Dreystadt, the German-born
service mechanic who took over Cadillac in the Depression years of the
thirties, an- swered: “Cadillac competes with diamonds and mink coats.
The Cadillac customer does not buy ‘transportation’ but ‘status.’” This
answer saved Cadillac, which was about to go under. Within two years or
so, it made it into a major growth business despite the Depres-
sion.</p>
<p>What Is Value to the Customer?</p>
<p>The final question needed to come to grips with business purpose and
business mission is: “What is value to the customer?” It may be the most
important question. Yet it is the one least often asked.</p>
<p>One reason is that managers are quite sure that they know the answer.
Value is what they, in their business, define as quality. But this is
almost always the wrong definition.</p>
<p>For the teenage girl, for instance, value in a shoe is high fashion.
It has to be “in.”</p>
<p>Price is a secondary consideration and durability is not value at
all. For the same girl as a young mother, a few years later, high
fashion becomes a restraint. She will not buy some- thing that is quite
unfashionable. But what she looks for is durability, price, comfort and
fit, and so on. The same shoe that represents the best buy for the
teenager is a very poor value for her slightly older sister.</p>
<p>Manufacturers tend to consider this as irrational behavior. But the
first rule is that there are no irrational customers. Customers almost
without exception behave rationally in terms of their own realities and
their own situation. High fashion is rationality for the teenage girl;
her other needs—food and housing—are, after all, still taken care of by
her parents, as a rule. High fashion is a restraint for the young
housewife who has to budget, who is on her feet a great deal, who has
“her man,” and who no longer goes out every weekend.</p>
<p>The customer never buys a product. By definition the customer buys
the satisfaction of a want. He buys value. Yet the manufacturer, by
definition, cannot produce value. He can only make and sell a product.
What the manufacturer considers quality may, there- fore, be irrelevant
and nothing but waste and useless expense.</p>
<p>Another reason why the question “What is value to the customer?” is
rarely asked is that the economists think they know the answer: value is
price. This is misleading, if not actually the wrong answer.</p>
<p>Price is anything but a simple concept, to begin with. Then there are
other value con- cepts which may determine what price really means. In
many cases, finally, price is sec- ondary and a limiting factor rather
than the essence of value.</p>
<p>Here are some examples to illustrate what price might mean to
different customers.</p>
<p>Electrical equipment such as fuse boxes or circuit breakers are paid
for by the homeowner but selected and bought by the electrical
contractor. What is price to the electrical con- tractor is not the
manufacturer’s price for the product. It is the price of the
manufacturer plus the cost of installation—for that, of course, is price
to his customer, the homeowner. Contractors are notoriously
price-conscious. Yet, a high-priced make of fuse boxes and circuit
breakers is the market leader in the U.S. To the contractor this line is
actually low- priced because it is engineered to be installed fast and
by relatively unskilled labor.</p>
<p>Xerox owes its success, to a large extent, to defining price as what
the customer pays for a copy rather than what he pays for the machine.
Xerox, accordingly, has priced its</p>
<p>machines in terms of the copies used. In other words, the customer
pays for the copy rather than for the machine—and, of course, what the
customer wants are copies rather than a machine.</p>
<p>In the American automobile industry, where most new cars are sold in
trade against a used car, price is actually a constantly shifting
configuration of differentials between the manufacturer’s price for a
new car and prices for a second-hand and third-hand used car, a
third-hand and fourth-hand used car, and so on. And the whole is further
complicated on the one hand by constantly changing differentials between
the amount a dealer will allow on a used car and the price he will ask
for it, and on the other hand by the differences in running costs
between various makes and sizes. Only advanced mathematics can calculate
the real automobile price.</p>
<p>For products and services, price can be determined—as distinct from
undifferentiated commodities such as copper of a certain purity—only by
understanding what is value to the customer. As the Xerox example shows,
it is up to the manufacturer or supplier to design the pricing structure
which fits the customer’s value concept.</p>
<p>But price is also only a part of value. There is a whole range of
quality considerations which are not expressed in price: durability,
freedom from breakdown, the maker’s stand- ing, service, etc. High price
itself may actually be value—as in expensive perfumes, ex- pensive furs,
or exclusive gowns.</p>
<p>Here are two examples. In the early days of the Common Market, two
young Euro- pean engineers opened a small office with a few hundred
dollars, a telephone, and a shelf full of manufacturers’ catalogs of
electronic components. Within ten years they had built a large and
highly profitable wholesale business. Their customers are the industrial
users of electronic equipment such as relays and machine controls. The
young engineers manufac- ture nothing. The components which they supply
can be obtained, often at a lower price, directly from the manufacturer.
But these young engineers relieve the customer of the tedious chore of
finding the right component part. They need only be told the kind of
equipment, the manufacturer, the model number, and the part that needs
replacement—a condenser, for instance, or a micro-switch. They then
immediately identify the specific part needed. They also know what parts
made by other manufacturers can be used for a job. They therefore can
tell a customer what he needs, give him immediate service, often on the
same day, and yet keep their inventory low. Expertise and speedy service
is value to the customer for which he is perfectly willing to pay a
substantial premium. “Our busi- ness is not electronic parts,” said one
of the young men, “it is information.”</p>
<p>An American company making lubricating compounds for heavy
earthmoving equip- ment such as is used by highway builders has long had
a reputation for the quality of its products. Yet it could not gain more
than a very small share of the market, as it competed against every
major petroleum company. It then asked the question “What is value to
the customer?” The answer was “to keep very expensive machinery
operating without break- downs.” One hour down-time may cost a
construction company more money than it could possibly spend on
lubricating compounds in the course of an entire year. The company
usually works against a deadline and risks penalty payments if it misses
it. As a result of this seemingly obvious insight, the lubricating
compound manufacturer no longer sells lubricating compounds. Instead he
offers to pay the owner of heavy earth-moving equip- ment the full cost
of any hour of down-time caused by lubricating failure. The only condi-
tion attached to this offer is that the construction company adopt and
follow a mainte- nance program designed by the manufacturer’s service
representatives which, of course, prescribes the company’s lubricating
compounds. The company formerly had to price its products below those of
the major petroleum companies; no customer now even asks, “What do you
charge for your lubricating compounds?”</p>
<p>What about such concepts of value on the part of the customer as the
service he re- ceives? There is little doubt, for instance, that the
American housewife today buys appli- ances largely on the basis of the
service experience she or her friends and neighbors have had with other
appliances sold under the same brand name. The speed with which she
can</p>
<p>obtain service if something goes wrong, the quality of the service,
and its cost have be- come major determinants in the buyer’s
decision.</p>
<p>What a company’s different customers consider value is so complicated
that it can be answered only by the customers themselves. Management
should not even try to guess at the answers—it should always go to the
customers in a systematic quest for them.</p>
<p>The marketing approach outlined here will not, by itself, result in a
definition of the purpose and mission of a business. For many businesses
the approach will raise more questions than it answers. This is true of
the business which has as its basic core of unity a common technology
rather than a common market. (See Chapter 57, “Building Unity Out of
Diversity.”) Examples are chemical companies but also commercial banks.
Similarly, process businesses—e.g., steel companies or aluminum
refiners—need much more than one market definition to define their
business. Of necessity, their products go into an in- finity of markets,
serve a multitude of customers, and have to satisfy a great variety of
value concepts and value expectations.</p>
<p>Yet even such businesses should start their attempt to ask “What is
our business?” by first asking, “Who are our customers? Where are they?
What do they consider value?” A business—and for that matter, any
institution—is determined by its contribution; every- thing else is
effort rather than result. What the customer pays is revenue; everything
else is cost. The approach from the outside, that is, from the market,
is only one step. But it is the step that comes before all others. It
alone can give understanding and thereby replace opinions as the
foundation for the most fundamental decision that faces every manage-
ment.</p>
<p>When to Ask “What Is Our Business?”</p>
<p>Most managements, if they ask the question at all, ask “What is our
business?” when the company is in trouble. Of course, then it must be
asked. And then asking the question may, indeed, have spectacular
results and may even reverse what appears irreversible decline—as shown
by the example of Vail’s work at Bell Telephone and of the reversal of
the carpet industry’s long-term downward trend. The success of General
Motors also re- sulted from asking “What is our business?” when the
company was floundering. When Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., became president in
1920, GM was in deep trouble and barely viable. Sloan’s definition of
the purpose and mission of GM, and his development of both strat- egy
and structure from this definition, gave GM leadership and outstanding
profitability within three years or less.*</p>
<p>To wait until a business—or an industry—is in trouble is playing
Russian roulette. It is irresponsible management. The question should be
asked at the inception of a business— and particularly for a business
that has ambitions to grow. Such a business better start with a clear
entrepreneurial concept.</p>
<p>One successful example is the Wall Street firm which in the sixties
rose to leadership in the American securities market. Donaldson, Lufkin,
and Jenrette (DLJ) was founded by three young men right out of business
school. They had little except an idea. Yet the firm rose within five or
six years to seventh place among Wall Street houses. DLJ then became the
first Wall Street firm to sell its shares to the public and started the
long-overdue change of the New York Stock Exchange from a private club
to a service institution. It was the first firm to do something about
Wall Street’s need to broaden its capital base, which thoughtful people
had seen for thirty years. “Our business,” the founders of DLJ said, “is
to provide financial services, financial advice, and financial
management to the new ‘capitalists,’ the institutional investors such as
pension funds and mutual funds.” In retrospect, this definition was
obvious: right answers always are. By 1950 it had become quite clear
that these new institutional investors were rapidly becoming the
dominant force in the American capital market and the main channel
through which individuals</p>
<p>*On Sloan’s work, see his book, My Years with General Motors
(Doubleday, 1964), and my book, Managing for Results (1964).</p>
<p>were directing their savings into the capital market. Yet at the time
at which this answer was given, it went counter to everything the rest
of Wall Street knew.</p>
<p>The man who decides to become his own boss may not have to ask, “What
is my busi- ness?” If he, for instance, mixes up a new cleaning compound
in his garage and starts peddling it from door to door, he needs to know
only that his mixture does a superior job in removing stains. But when
the product catches on; when he has to hire people to mix it and to sell
it; when he has to decide whether to keep on selling directly or through
retail stores—department stores, supermarkets, hardware stores, or all
three; what additional products he needs for a full line—then he has to
ask and to answer the question “What is my business?” Otherwise, even
with the best of products, he will soon be back wearing out his own shoe
leather peddling from door to door.</p>
<p>The most important time to ask seriously “What is our business?” is
when a company has been successful. To understand this has been the
great strength of Sears, Roebuck. It is also one of the secrets of the
success of Marks andandandand Spencer in Great Britain. (See the next
chapter.) And not to have understood this is a major reason for the
present crisis of American schools and American universities.</p>
<p>Success always obsoletes the very behavior that achieved it. It
always creates new re- alities. It always creates, above all, its own
and different problems. Only the fairy story ends “They lived happily
ever after.”</p>
<p>It is not easy for the management of a successful company to ask,
“What is our busi- ness?” Everybody in the company then thinks that the
answer is so obvious as not to de- serve discussion. It is never popular
to argue with success, never popular to rock the boat.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks knew that the penalty for the hubris of success is
severe. The management that does not ask “What is our business?” when
the company is successful is, in effect, smug, lazy, and arrogant. It
will not be long before success will turn into failure.</p>
<p>The two most successful American industries of the 1920s were
anthracite coal mines and railroads. Both believed that God had given
them an unshakable monopoly forever. Both believed that the definition
of their business was so obvious as to eliminate all need for thought,
let alone for action. Neither need have tumbled from its leadership
position— the anthracite industry into total oblivion—had their
managements not taken success for granted.</p>
<p>Above all: when a management attains the company’s objectives, it
should always ask seriously, “What is our business?’’ This requires
self-discipline and responsibility. The alternative is decline.</p>
<p>“What Will Our Business Be?”</p>
<p>Sooner or later even the most successful answer to the question “What
is our business?” becomes obsolete.</p>
<p>Theodore Vail’s answer was good for almost two-thirds of a century.
But by the late 1960s it became apparent that it was no longer adequate;
the telephone system was no longer, as in Vail’s days, a natural
monopoly. Alternative ways of telecommunication were rapidly becoming
possible. By the late sixties it had also become apparent that the
traditional definition of the telephone as an instrument to transmit
voice messages had become inadequate, both because of the rapid growth
in data transmission over telephone wires and because of the increasing
possibility of transmitting visual images together with the voice.
Vail’s simple and elegant definition of the business of the Bell
Telephone Sys- tem was in need of reexamination.</p>
<p>The brilliant answer which Alfred P. Sloan, as the new president of
General Motors, gave in the early 1920s to the question “What is GM’s
business?” also held good for an amazingly long time, right through
World War II and the postwar recovery. But by 1960 or so, while Sloan,
though retired, was himself still alive, the answer had become inade-
quate and inappropriate. That GM has not raised the question again and
apparently has not seen the need to think it through again surely has a
lot to do with the evident vulner-</p>
<p>ability of the company to consumer dissatisfaction, public pressures,
and political attack, and with its inability to attain leadership
position in the world automobile market.</p>
<p>Very few definitions of the purpose and mission of a business have
anything like a life expectancy of thirty, let alone fifty, years. To be
good for ten years is probably all one can normally expect.</p>
<p>In asking “What is our business?” management therefore also needs to
add, “And what will it be? What changes in the environment are already
discernible that are likely to have high impact on the characteristics,
mission, and purpose of our business?” and “How do we now build these
anticipations into our theory of the business, into its objectives,
strategies, and work assignments?”</p>
<p>The method and approach needed to tackle this question—and the next
question, “What should our business be?”—will be discussed in Chapter
10, “Strategic Planning.” But what basic questions to ask belongs
here.</p>
<p>Again the market, its potential and its trends, is the starting
point. How large a market can we project for our business in five or ten
years—assuming no basic changes in cus- tomers, in market structure, or
in technology? And, what factors could validate or dis- prove these
projections?</p>
<p>The most important of these trends is one to which few businesses pay
much attention: changes in population structure and population dynamics.
Traditionally businessmen, following the economists, have assumed that
demographics are a constant. Historically this has been a sound
assumption. Populations used to change very slowly except as a result of
catastrophic events, such as major war or famine. This is no longer
true, how- ever. Populations nowadays can and do change drastically, in
developed as well as in de- veloping countries.</p>
<p>Every developed country (with the single exception of Great Britain
perhaps) had at least a small baby boom in the decade following World
War II. Young married women had many more babies than before, and had
them in closer sequence. Ten years later this was followed by an equally
spectacu1ar “baby bust,’’ in which the number of live births went down
very sharply.</p>
<p>In the developing countries the birth rate did not increase, but the
number of babies who survived infancy increased spectacularly, and is
still increasing. In other words, in a short twenty-five years, the
whole population structure changed drastically. In the United States,
for instance, the largest single age group in 1950 were the
thirty-eight- to forty- year-olds. Ten years later the largest age group
were the seventeen-year-olds. But by 1980 the largest single age group
in America will be the twenty-five-year-olds. Since 1945, also, there
has been an educational explosion in every developed country. In the
develop- ing countries there has been rapid urbanization, as a result of
which Latin America, for instance, has ceased to be rural in its
population structure and has become predominantly urban.</p>
<p>The importance of demographics does not lie only in the impact
population structure has on buying power and buying habits, and on the
size and structure of the work force. Population shifts are the only
events regarding the future for which true prediction is pos- sible.
People do not enter the labor force till they are at least in their
teens—and in the developed countries, increasingly, not until they are
twenty. They do not form households until then either, nor become
primary customers in their own right. In other words, major trends in
markets, buying power and buying behavior, customer needs, and
employment can be predicted with near-certainty by analyzing what has
already happened in popula- tion dynamics and population structure.</p>
<p>Any attempt to anticipate tomorrow—and this is, of course, what we
are trying to do by asking “What will our business be?”—has to start
with demographic analysis as the sturdiest and most reliable
foundation.</p>
<p>The massive impact of even fairly minor demographic changes is
illustrated by the sharp shift in the American magazine industry.</p>
<p>As late as 1950 the mass-circulation magazine was America’s most
successful and most profitable communications medium, and seemed
impregnable. But the leaders of</p>
<p>those days—Collier’s, The Saturday Evening Post, Look, and Life—have
disappeared. The survivors are fighting for their lives. The development
is often blamed on television. But magazines as a whole have not
suffered from television just as they did not earlier suffer from radio.
On the contrary, total magazine circulation as well as magazine adver-
tising have gone up faster since television appeared than they did
before, and they are still going up fast. What has happened is that
population has changed—partly because of the change in age structure,
but primarily because of the change in educational levels. The
undifferentiated mass audience is gone. Its place has been taken by a
large number of specialty mass markets, that is, groups of substantial
but still limited size, of much higher education and purchasing power,
and of sharply defined and specialized interests. These groups read
magazines even more than the earlier generation—for the simple reason
that they read more. They are a better market for magazine
advertisers—for the simple reason that they buy more. Each of these
better-educated and affluent audience segments is, in itself, a mass
audience—but a specialized one.</p>
<p>This change in audience could easily have been anticipated in
1950—the demographic development had already happened. It was seen
clearly by a number of publishers. On this understanding are based all
the American magazine successes of the last twenty years, from Business
Week to Modern Bride, from Sports Illustrated to Playboy, from
Scientific American to Psychology Today or TV Guide. All these new
magazines apply basic con- cepts which the mass-circulation magazines
first developed, in editorial, in circulation, and in advertising. But
they apply them in accordance with the new population structure, that
is, to a demographic segment characterized by a common interest. All of
them have circulations well above half a million, if not larger; but
they deliberately do not appeal to a general audience. All of them
represent a conscious and deliberate exploitation of demographic
opportunities. They can obtain their audience at low—or at least at
reason- able—circulation-acquisition costs. The old mass-audience
magazines, however, have increasingly had to buy circulation, that is,
to invest far more in subscription acquisition than they can possibly
get back in subscription revenue. As a result the new specialty mass
magazines soon also get the advertising.</p>
<p>Management needs to anticipate changes in market structure resulting
from changes in the economy; from changes in fashion or taste; from
moves by competition. And competi- tion must always be defined according
to the customer’s concept of what product or ser- vice he buys and thus
must include indirect as well as direct competition.</p>
<p>The Unsatisfied Wants of the Customer</p>
<p>Finally, management has to ask which of the consumer’s wants are not
adequately satis- fied by the products or services offered him today.
The ability to ask this question and to answer it correctly usually
makes the difference between a growth company and one that depends for
its development on the rising tide of the economy or of the industry.
But whoever contents himself to rise with the tide will also fall with
it.</p>
<p>One example of a successful analysis of the customer’s unsatisfied
wants is Sears, Roebuck, of course. But the topic is so important as to
warrant further illustration.</p>
<p>Sony asked the question “What are the customer’s unsatisfied wants?”
when it first decided to move into the American consumer market in the
mid-fifties. Sony had been founded right after the end of World War II
as a manufacturer of tape recorders and had achieved modest success with
its products in its own domestic market. It had entered the U.S. as a
small but reliable supplier of high-priced professional tape-recording
equipment for broadcasting studios. Yet the product with which it first
established itself in the American mass-consumer market was a product it
had never made before—portable tran- sistor radios. Young people, Sony’s
analysis of the market showed, were taking the exist- ing heavy, clumsy,
and expensive equipment—phonographs weighing many pounds, or
battery-powered radios with audio tubes—on picnics, camping trips, and
other excur- sions. Surely here was an unsatisfied want for light,
cheap, and yet dependable instru- ment. Sony did not develop the
transistor—Bell Laboratories had done that, in America.</p>
<p>The Bell Laboratories people, however, as well as all the electronic
manufacturers in America, had decided that the customer was not yet
ready for transistorized equipment. They looked at the wants of the
customer that were satisfied by the existing equipment, wants for
equipment that was meant to be kept in one place. Sony, by asking “What
are the unsatisfied wants?” identified a new growth market—and within an
incredibly short period established itself worldwide as the leader and
the pacesetter.</p>
<p>Of the world’s leading businesses, Unilever has probably done the
most work on “What will our business be?” The method Unilever has
developed and the models it has built for each of its major product
lines and each of its major national markets take into account a large
number of factors, from national income to changes in retail
distribution, and from eating habits to taxation. But the foundation and
starting point are population figures and population trends. These one
does not have to forecast; one can build on what has already
happened.</p>
<p>“What Should Our Business Be?”</p>
<p>“What will our business be?” aims at adaptation to anticipated
changes. It aims at modify- ing, extending, developing the existing,
ongoing business.</p>
<p>But there is need also to ask “What should our business be?” What
opportunities are opening up or can be created to fulfill the purpose
and mission of the business by making it into a different business?</p>
<p>IBM had long defined its business as data processing. Prior to 1950,
this meant punch cards and equipment for sorting them. When the computer
came, and with it a new tech- nology in which IBM had not the slightest
expertise, IBM, asking, “What should our business be?,” realized that
data processing henceforth would have to mean computers rather than
punch cards.</p>
<p>Businesses that fail to ask this question are likely to miss their
major opportunity. The American life insurance industry has long defined
its business as providing basic invest- ment and financial security to
the American family. Right through World War II, the life insurance
policy was indeed the best way to discharge this purpose and mission.
Since World War II, however, the majority of the American people has
attained incomes that enable it to accumulate savings beyond what is
needed to buy adequate life insurance pro- tection. At the same time,
the whole population has become acutely conscious of inflation, that is,
of the erosion of the value of the traditionally conservative and safe
investments of fixed money value. The life insurance companies have the
access to the market and the selling organization. In their own list of
policyholders they have the largest inventory of financial customers in
the country. Yet very few of them have asked the question “What should
our business be?” As a result, life insurance has steadily been losing
market stand- ing. Before World War II life insurance was, next to the
family’s home, the leading in- vestment of the middle class. It has now
slipped to third or fourth place and is still going down. The new
savings increasingly have not been going into life insurance but into
mu- tual funds and pension funds.</p>
<p>What the life insurance companies lacked was not innovation. The
needed financial instruments had all been developed much earlier. What
they lacked was the willingness to ask “What should our business be?”
and to take the question seriously.</p>
<p>Next to changes in society, economy, and market as factors demanding
consideration in answering “What should our business be?” comes, of
course, innovation, one’s own and that of others.</p>
<p>Changes in the nature of the business arising out of innovation are
too well known to require much documentation. All major enterprises in
the engineering and chemical fields have largely grown by converting
innovation into new business. The Eurodollar which these last ten years
has financed a good deal of world trade was (as said earlier not in-
vented by the large American commercial banks. But they immediately saw
its signifi- cance, and their success in making the Eurodollar into an
international currency explains, in large measure, their rapid growth in
multinational banking.</p>
<p>Finally—a special but important reason for changing what “our
business is” to “what it should be”—then is the business of “the wrong
size.” (See Chapter 55, “On Being the Wrong Size.”)</p>
<p>The Need for Planned Abandonment</p>
<p>Just as important as the decision on what new and different things to
do is planned, sys- tematic abandonment of the old that no longer fits
the purpose and mission of the busi- ness, no longer conveys
satisfaction to the customer or customers, no longer makes a su- perior
contribution.</p>
<p>An essential step in deciding what our business is, what it will be,
and what it should be is, therefore, systematic analysis of all existing
products, services, processes, markets, end uses, and distribution
channels. Are they still viable? And are they likely to remain viable?
Do they still give value to the customer? And are they likely to do so
tomorrow? Do they still fit the realities of population and markets, of
technology and economy? And if not, how can we best abandon them—or at
least stop pouring in further resources and efforts? Unless these
questions are being asked seriously and systematically, and unless
managements are willing to act on the answers to them, the best
definition of “What our business is, will be, and should be” will remain
a pious platitude. Energy will be used up in defending yesterday. No one
will have the time, resources, or will to work on exploit- ing today,
let alone to work on making tomorrow.</p>
<p>Planned abandonment was first discussed and advocated in my book
Managing for Results. It first was adopted as a systematic policy a few
years later by the General Elec- tric Company. Most long-range planning
in large companies, like Unilever, focuses on the question “What will
our business be?” GE’s strategic business planning developed in the late
sixties is an exception. Its aim is to answer “What should our business
be?” Yet GE’s planning does not start out with the question “What new
things should we go into?” It starts out with “What existing product
lines and businesses should we abandon?” and “Which ones should we cut
back and deemphasize?”</p>
<p>Defining the purpose and mission of the business is difficult,
painful, and risky. But it alone enables a business to set objectives,
to develop strategies, to concentrate its re- sources and to go to work.
It alone enables a business to be managed for performance.</p>

<p>ONE COMPANY IN THE WESTERN WORLD CAN (as has been said earlier) be
compared with Sears, Roebuck: Marks andandandand Spencer. It might even
be slightly ahead in growth of sales and profits over a long period of
years.</p>
<p>Like Sears, Marks andandandand Spencer is a chain retailer. It opened
its first penny bazaar in 1884, or just about the time Richard Sears
made his first mail-order offer of cheap but reliable watches to the
Midwestern farmer. By 1915 the company was building variety stores. It
has been growing fast ever since. Its most spectacular growth period,
however, was the ten years between 1963 and 1972—a period in Britain’s
economic history which was characterized by “stagflation,” i.e.,
inflationary stagnation, rather than growth. During this difficult
period Marks andandandand Spencer more than doubled its sales volume
(from £184 million to £463 million, or in U.S. dollars, 60 million to $
l,100 million). Profits went up just as fast, from £22 million to £54
million (5 million to 35 million). Equally remarkable was the profit
margin—almost 12 percent on sales before taxes—which is double what any
other retail merchant (except Sears) would consider fully
satisfactory.</p>
<p>Social Revolution as Business Mission</p>
<p>By the mid-twenties the four brothers-in-law (Simon Marks, Israel
Sieff, Harry Sacher, and Norman Laski) who had built the penny bazaars
of 1915 into a major chain of variety stores owned a successful
business. They might have been satisfied to rest on their laurels and to
enjoy their considerable wealth. Instead they decided—following a trip
to America by Simon Marks in 1924 in the course of which he carefully
studied Sears, Roebuck—to rethink the purpose and mission of their
business. The business of Marks andandandand Spencer, they decided, was
not retailing. It was social revolution.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer redefined its business as the subversion
of the class structure of nineteenth-century England by making available
to the working and lower middle classes upper-class goods of better than
upper-class quality, and yet at prices the working and
lower-middle-class customer could well afford.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer was by no means alone in the England of
the twenties in seeing a major opportunity in the rapid social changes
of the post-World War I period (another contemporary example was
Montague Burton, the “Fifty Shilling Tailor”). What made</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer unique and successful, however, was its
conversion of the definition of “what our business is, and should be”
into clear, specific, operationally effective and multiple
objectives.</p>
<p>This required first a decision as to what to concentrate on, that is,
a basic strategy objective.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer had been a variety store chain like many
others, offering a large assortment of products which had nothing in
common except low price. Now the company decided to concentrate on
wearing apparel (to which it soon added household textiles such as
towels and draperies).</p>
<p>This was a rational decision. In the England of that time dress was
still highly classdetermined and the most visible of all class
distinctions. Yet all of Europe, after World War I, had become fashion
conscious. At the same time mass-production facilities for good-quality
but inexpensive fabrics and clothes had come into being, in large part
as a result of the huge demand for uniforms during World War I. New
textile fibers, such as rayon and acetate, were coming on the market.
There was still, however, no massdistribution system in England for
well-designed, up-to-date, and inexpensive clothing for the masses.</p>
<p>Within a few years the new Marks andandandand Spencer had become the
leading clothing and textile distributor in England, a position held
ever since. By 1972 clothing sales accounted for a full three-quarters
of total Marks andandandand Spencer volume, i.e., for £327 million
(roughly 00 million).</p>
<p>After World War II the same thinking was applied to a new major
product category: food. During World War II the English people, formerly
known for their dogged resistance to any innovation in eating, learned
to accept new foods. Marks andandandand Spencer’s food business
accounted, in 1972, for the remaining one-fourth of its sales.</p>
<p>From having been a successful variety chain in the early twenties,
and even in the early thirties, Marks andandandand Spencer purposefully
changed itself into a highly distinct “specialty” marketer—maybe the
largest in the world.</p>
<p>The concentration decision then enabled the company to set specific
marketing objectives. The decision enabled it to decide who its customer
was and should be; what kind of store it needed and when; what pricing
policy to follow; and what market penetration to aim at.</p>
<p>The next area which Marks andandandand Spencer tackled was that of
innovation objectives. The clothing and textiles Marks andandandand
Spencer needed did not exist at the time. Marks andandandand Spencer
started out with quality control, like any other large retailer. But it
rapidly built its qualitycontrol laboratories into research, design, and
development centers. It developed new fabrics, new dyestuffs, new
processes, new blends, and so on. It developed designs and fashions.
Finally, it went out and looked for the right manufacturer, whom it
often had to help get started—for the existing old-line manufacturers
were for obvious reasons none too eager to throw in their lot with the
brash upstart who tried to tell them how to run their business. And
when, after World War II, the company moved into prepared and processed
foods, bakery goods, and dairy products, it applied the same innovative
approach to a new industry.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer set innovation goals in marketing. It
pioneered, for instance, in consumer research in the early thirties,
when such work was still so new* that Marks andandandand Spencer had to
develop the needed techniques.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer set objectives for the supply and
development of key resources. It early copied and adapted the Sears
program for recruiting, training, and developing managers. It set
objectives for the systematic development of financial resources, and
measurements to control the utilization of these resources. And it set
objectives for the development of its physical facilities, that is, for
retail stores.</p>
<ul>
<li>General Motors had a consumer research activity well before 1929. I
doubt that this was known to Marks andandandand Spencer, however; it was
not generally known even within the American automobile indastry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hand in hand with these objectives for resources went objectives for
their productivity. Marks andandandand Spencer had originally taken its
measurements and controls from America. In the twenties and early
thirties it began to set its own objectives for continuously improving
the productivity of key resources.</p>
<p>As a result, Marks andandandand Spencer has a singularly high
productivity of capital—surely one of the keys to its success.
Unnoticed, by and large—but fully as important—is the productivity of
the Marks andandandand Spencer retail store, which exceeds, to my
knowledge, anything to be found anyplace else, including even Sears,
Roebuck or Kresge, the acknowledged store-management virtuosi of the
American retail scene.</p>
<p>Up till the late twenties the expansion of Marks andandandand Spencer
had been achieved primarily by opening new stores. Since the thirties
Marks andandandand Spencer’s expansion has been achieved primarily by
making each store more productive and by raising sales per square foot
of selling space. Marks andandandand Spencer, measured by the number of
its stores, is still a small chain—there are only 250 stores. The stores
themselves are not large, even by English standards; the average selling
area is only 20,000 square feet per store. (The large American
supermarket, by comparison, goes up to 100,000 square feet.) Yet these
small stores sell something like million apiece a year, which is many
times what even highly successful retail stores of other companies do.
The only explanation is continual upgrading of volume per store, that
is, upgrading of merchandise, display, and sales per customer. Store
selling space is the controlling resource of a retail merchant; Marks
andandandand Spencer’s success in raising its utilization was central to
its performance.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer set objectives for its social
responsibilities, and especially for areas of major impact: its own work
force and its suppliers. It introduced “staff manageresses” into its
stores to look after the employees, to take care of personal problems,
and to make sure employees are treated with intelligence and compassion.
Personnel management remains the job of the store manager. The staff
manageress was set up to be the “people conscience” of the company.</p>
<p>Similarly Marks andandandand Spencer developed objectives for its
relations with its suppliers.</p>
<p>The more successfully a supplier works with Marks andandandand
Spencer, the more dependent upon the company he will be. To safeguard
the supplier against exploitation by the company became a concern of the
company’s management. It set out to develop a “putting out” system
which, unlike its pre-industrial predecessor of early eighteenth-century
England, would not impoverish the supplier and make him less secure but
would, on the contrary, enrich the supplier and give him security.</p>
<p>But what about a profit objective? The answer is that there has never
been one. Profit goals have been anathema at Marks andandandand Spencer.
Obviously the company is highly profitable and highly profit conscious.
But it sees profit not as an objective but as a requirement of the
business, that is, not as a goal but as a need. Profit, in the Marks
andandandand Spencer view, is the result of doing things right rather
than the purpose of business activity. It is, above all, determined by
what is necessary to attain company objectives. Profitability is a
measurement of how well the business discharges its functions in serving
market and customer. Above all, it is a restraint; unless profit is
adequate to cover the risks, a company will not be able to attain its
objectives.</p>
<p>I do not know how conscious Marks andandandand Spencer’s top
management was in the early years, the late twenties and early thirties,
of the full import of the decisions they then made. There was probably
no master plan. But the young key executives who were brought into the
firm in those years to take on new jobs such as innovation or the
development of productivity objectives and standards were fully aware
that their company had committed itself to a definition of what its
business was—and they knew what the definition entailed. They were
highly conscious of the company’s social and business objectives. They
knew what these objectives meant to each of them individually in terms
of performance goals, performance standards, and demands for their own
contribution.</p>
<p>Marks andandandand Spencer from the start converted objectives into
work assignments. It thought through what results and contributions were
needed in each objectives area. It</p>
<p>assigned responsibility for these results to someone and held him
accountable. And it measured performance and contribution against the
objectives.</p>
<p>The Lessons</p>
<p>The Marks andandandand Spencer story reaffirms the central importance
of thinking through “what our business is and what it should be.” But it
also shows that this, by itself, is not enough. The basic definition of
the business and of its purpose and mission have to be translated into
objectives. Otherwise, they remain insight, good intentions, and
brilliant epigrams which never became achievement.</p>
<p>The Marks andandandand Spencer story brings out the specifications
for objectives. Each of them will be discussed in some detail in the
next chapter. But here is the list:</p>
<p>3 Objectives must make possible concentration of resources and
efforts. They must winnow out the fundamentals among the goals of a
business so that the key resources of men, money, and physical
facilities can be concentrated. They must, therefore, be selective
rather than encompass everything.</p>
<p>4 There must be multiple objectives rather than a single objective.
Much of today’s lively discussion of management by objectives is
concerned with the search for the “one right objective.” This search is
not only likely to be as unproductive as the quest for the philosopher’s
stone; it does harm and mis-</p>
<p>directs.</p>
<p>To manage a business is to balance a variety of needs and goals. And
this requires multiple objectives.</p>
<p>5 Objectives are needed in all areas on which the survival of the
business depends. The specific targets, the goals in any objective area,
depend on the strategy of the individual business. But the areas in
which objectives are needed are the same for all businesses, for all
businesses depend on the same</p>
<p>factors for their survival.</p>
<p>Objectives, therefore, have to be set in these eight key areas:</p>
<p>The Basis for Work and Assignments</p>
<p>Objectives are the basis for work and assignments. They determine the
structure of the business the key activities which must be discharged,
and, above all, the allocation of people to tasks. Objectives are the
foundation for designing both the structure of the business and the work
of individual units and individual managers.</p>
<p>Objectives are always needed in all eight key areas. The area without
specific objectives will be neglected. Unless we determine what shall be
measured and what the yardstick of measurement in an area will be, the
area itself will not be seen. (On this see Chapter 39.)</p>
<p>The measurements available for the key areas of a business enterprise
are still haphazard by and large. We do not even have adequate concepts,
let alone measurements, except for market standing. For something as
central as profitability we have only a rubber yardstick; and we have no
real tools at all to determine how much profitability is necessary. In
respect to innovation and, even more, to productivity; we hardly know
more than that something ought to be done. In the other areas—including
physical and financial resources—we are reduced to statements of
intentions; we do not possess goals and measurements for their
attainment.</p>
<p>However, enough is known about each area to give a progress report at
least. Enough is known for each business to go to work on
objectives.</p>
<p>How To Use Objectives</p>
<p>We know one more thing about objectives: how to use them. If
objectives are only good intentions they are worthless. They must
degenerate into work. And work is always specific, always has—or should
have—clear, unambiguous, measurable results, a deadline and a specific
assignment of accountability.</p>
<p>But objectives that become a straitjacket do harm. Objectives are
always based on expectations. And expectations are, at best, informed
guesses. Objectives express an appraisal of factors that are largely
outside the business and not under its control. The world does not stand
still.</p>
<p>The proper way to use objectives is the way an airline uses schedules
and flight plans.</p>
<p>The schedule provides for the 9 A.M. flight from Los Angeles to get
to Boston by 5 P.M. But if there is a blizzard in Boston that day, the
plane will land in Pittsburgh instead and wait out the storm. The flight
plan provides for flying at 30,000 feet and for flying over Denver and
Chicago. But if the pilot encounters turbulence or strong headwinds he
will ask flight control for permission to go up another 5,000 feet and
to take the MinneapolisMontreal route. Yet no flight is ever operated
without schedule and flight plan. Any change is immediately fed back to
produce a new schedule and flight plan. Unless 97 per-</p>
<p>cent or so of its flights proceed on the original schedule and flight
plan—or within a very limited range of deviation from either—a well-run
airline gets another operations manager who knows his job.</p>
<p>Objectives are not fate; they are direction. They are not commands;
they are commitments. They do not determine the future; they are means
to mobilize the resources and energies of the business for the making of
the future.</p>

<p>ARKETING AND INNOVATION is in these two areas that a business</p>
<p>are the foundation areas in objective setting. It obtains its
results. It is performance and contri-</p>
<p>bution in these areas for which a customer pays. All objectives must
be performance objectives, aimed at doing rather than at good
intentions. In all other objective areas the purpose of doing is to make
possible the attainment of the objectives in the areas of marketing and
innovation.</p>
<p>It is somewhat misleading to speak of a marketing objective.
Marketing performance requires a number of objectives:</p>
<p>• for existing products and services in existing and present
markets;</p>
<p>• for abandonment of “yesterday” in product, services, and
markets;</p>
<p>• for new products and services for existing markets;</p>
<p>• for new markets;</p>
<p>• for the distributive organization;</p>
<p>• for service standards and service performance;</p>
<p>• for credit standards and credit performance, and so on.</p>
<p>Many books have been written on every one of these areas. But it is
almost never stressed that objectives in these areas can be set only
after two key decisions have been made: the decision on concentration,
and the decision on market standing.</p>
<p>The Concentration Decision</p>
<p>Whereas objectives are “strategy,” the concentration decision is
“policy.” It is, so to speak, the decision in what theater to fight a
war. Without such a policy decision, there can be rules of warfare but
no strategy, that is, no purposeful action.</p>
<p>At about the same time at which Marks andandandand Spencer chose
concentration on wearing apparel and textiles, Sears, Roebuck faced up
to the concentration decision. The area of concentration it decided on
was household appliances. This was a very different decision from that
of Marks andandandand Spencer but it was the right decision considering
both Sears’s basically different theory of its business and the
conditions prevailing in the American market in the late twenties. Sears
did not drop textiles from its stores. But until World War II it paid
little attention to them and did not aggressively compete in the apparel
market. The Sears concentration decision led the company into different
directions from those Marks andandandand Spencer took, e.g., into very
large stores; into heavy emphasis on a service organization, which
eventually led into the automotive field as a second concentration area;
and into heavy investment in the ownership of appliance makers.</p>
<p>Archimedes, one of the great scientists of antiquity, is reported to
have said: “Give me a place to stand on, and I can lift the universe of
its hinges.” The place to stand on is the area of concentration. It is
the area which gives a business the leverage that lifts the universe off
its hinges. The concentration decision is, therefore, a crucial
decision. It converts in large measure, the definition of “what our
business is” into meaningful operational commitment. It makes possible
work on one’s mission and purpose. It is the foundation for effective
strategy.</p>
<p>Wherever we find a business that is outstandingly successful, we will
find that it has thought through the concentration alternatives and has
made a concentration decision.</p>
<p>During the first fifteen years of the computer, that is, until the
mid-sixties, only two companies out of fifty or so who had entered the
field worldwide managed to make any profit on computers and obtain any
kind of market position: IBM and the much smaller Control Data
Corporation. Both owed their success largely to facing up to the
concentration decision. IBM, in the very infancy of computers, decided
to concentrate on the business market and to offer the computer
essentially as an accounting machine for large-scale repetitive handling
of conventional data such as accounting and payroll. Control Data, at
almost the same time, made the radically opposite decision to
concentrate on large-scale scientific applications. Both companies did
very well. The other computer companies all tried to “cover the market”;
none succeeded.</p>
<p>This is big-company stuff, many might say. But neither IBM nor
Control Data was a big company when it made its concentration decision
(see Chapter 60)—nor, incidentally, was Marks andandandand Spencer way
back in the 1920s. Actually, a small company needs the concentration
decision even more than a big one. Its resources are limited and will
produce no results unless concentrated.</p>
<p>The concentration decision is highly risky. It is a genuine decision.
It has to be tested again and again against the market; its dynamics,
its trends, and its changes. Without concentration, marketing
objectives—but also innovation objectives—are promises and good
intentions rather than true goals. Without them, the resources of the
business will not be allocated to performance.</p>
<p>The Market-Standing Decision</p>
<p>The other major decision underlying marketing objectives is that on
market standing. One common approach is to say, “We want to be the
leader.” The other one is to say, “We don’t care what share of the
market we have as long as sales go up.” Both sound plausible, but both
are wrong.</p>
<p>Obviously, not everybody can be the leader. One has to decide in
which segment of the market, with what product, what services, what
values, one should be the leader. It does not do much good for a
company’s sales to go up if it loses market share, that is, if the
market expands much faster than the company’s sales do.</p>
<p>A company with a small share of the market will eventually become
marginal in the marketplace, and thereby exceedingly vulnerable. In the
slightest economic setback its customers are likely to concentrate their
buying—and then they will concentrate on suppliers that have a
substantial share; distributors and retailers will try to cut inventory
by eliminating the marginal supplier. The sales volume of the marginal
supplier may become too small to give the needed service—one of the main
reasons why marginal appliance manufacturers, no matter how good their
product, or how well known their brand name, do not usually survive
long.</p>
<p>Market standing, regardless of the sales curve, is therefore
essential. The point at which the supplier becomes marginal varies from
industry to industry. But to be a marginal producer is dangerous for
long-term survival. And this is just as true for a department store, for
a bank, for an airline, or for an insurance company as it is for a
manufacturer. (On this, see Chapter 55, “On Being the Wrong Size.”)</p>
<p>There is also a maximum market standing above which it may be unwise
to go—even if there were no antitrust laws. Market domination tends to
lull the leader to sleep; monopolists flounder on their own complacency
rather than on public opposition. Market domination produces tremendous
internal resistance against any innovation and thus makes adaptation to
change dangerously difficult. Also, it usually means that the enterprise
has too many of its eggs in one basket and is too vulnerable to economic
fluctuations.</p>
<p>There is also well-founded resistance in the marketplace to
dependence on one dominant supplier. Whether it is the purchasing agent
of a manufacturing company, the procurement officer in the Air Force, or
the housewife, no one likes to be at the mercy of the monopoly
supplier.</p>
<p>Finally, the dominant supplier in a rapidly expanding, especially a
new, market is likely to do less well than if he shared that market with
one or two other major and competing suppliers. This may seem
paradoxical—and most businessmen find it difficult to accept. But the
fact is that a new market, especially a new major market, tends to
expand much more rapidly when there are several suppliers rather than
only one. It may be very flattering to a supplier’s ego to have 80
percent of a market. But if as a result of domination by a single
source, the market does not expand as it otherwise might, the supplier’s
revenues and profits are likely to be considerably lower than they would
be if two suppliers shared a fast-expanding market. Eighty percent of
100 is considerably less than 50 percent of 250. A new market which has
only one supplier is likely to become static at 100. It will be limited
by the imagination of the one supplier who always knows what his product
or service cannot or should not be used for. If there are several
suppliers, they are likely to uncover and promote markets and end uses
the single supplier never dreams of. And the market might grow rapidly
to 250.</p>
<p>Du Pont seems to have grasped this. In its most successful
innovations Du Pont retains a sole-supplier position only until the new
product has paid for the original investment. Then Du Pont licenses the
innovation and launches competitors deliberately. As a result, a number
of aggressive companies start developing new markets and new uses for
the product. Nylon would surely have grown much more slowly without Du
Pont-sponsored competition. Its markets are still growing, but without
competition it would probably have begun to decline in the early
fifties, when newer synthetic fibers were brought on the market by
Monsanto and Union Carbide in the U.S., Imperial Chemicals in Great
Britain, and AKU in Holland.</p>
<p>The market standing to aim at is not the maximum but the optimum.
This requires careful analysis of customers, of products or services, of
market segments, and distribution channels. It requires a market
strategy, and it requires a decision of high risk.</p>
<p>Innovation Objective</p>
<p>The innovation objective is the objective through which a company
makes operational its definition of “what our business should be.”</p>
<p>The problem in setting innovation objectives is the difficulty of
measuring the relative impact and importance of various innovations.
Technological leadership is clearly desirable, especially if the term
technology is used in its rightful sense as applying to the art, craft,
or science of any organized human activity. But how are we to determine
what weighs more: a hundred minor but immediately applicable
improvements in packaging a product, or one fundamental chemical
discovery which after ten more years of hard work may change the
character of the business altogether? A department store and a
pharmaceutical company will answer this question differently; but so may
two different pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>While innovating objectives will not be as unequivocal as marketing
objectives, they need to be specific and quantified—usually they can be
quantified, if only roughly.*</p>
<p>Deliberate emphasis on innovation may be needed most where
technological changes are least spectacular. No one in a pharmaceutical
company or in a company making synthetic organic chemicals needs to be
told that survival depends on the ability to replace three-quarters of
the company’s products by entirely new ones every ten years. But how
many people in an insurance company realize that the company’s
growth—perhaps even its survival—depends on the development of new forms
of insurance, the modification of existing policies, and the constant
search for new, better, and cheaper ways of selling policies and of
settling claims? The less visible or prominent technological change is
in a business, the greater is the danger that the whole organization
will ossify; hence the emphasis on innovation is doubly important.</p>
<p>It may be argued once more that such goals are big-company stuff,
suitable for General Electric or for General Motors but unnecessary for
a small business. But the small company’s need for innovation is as
great as that of the large company. And, as the managements of several
small companies I know assert, the comparative simplicity of planning
for innovation may be one of the main advantages of small size. As the
president of one of them puts it, “When you are small, you are
sufficiently close to the market to know fairly fast which new products
are needed. And your engineering staff is too small to become ingrown.
They know they can’t do everything themselves and, therefore, they keep
their eyes and ears wide open for any new development on the outside
that they could possibly use.”</p>
<p>*For methods to do this, see my book Managing for Results and the
very different but penetrating approach of Michael J. Kami, in “Business
Planning as Business Opportunity” in Preparing Tomorrow’s Business
Leaders Today, edited by Peter F. Drucker. There is also a list of
innovation goals in my book The Practice of Management (1954).</p>
<p>Resources, Their Supply, Utilization, and Productivity</p>
<p>A group of objectives deals with the resources a business needs to be
able to perform, with their supply, their utilization, and their
productivity.</p>
<p>All economic activity, economists have told us for two hundred years,
requires three kinds of resources: (1) land, that is, products of
nature; (2) labor, that is, human resources, and (3) capital, that is,
the means to invest in tomorrow. The business must be able to attract
all three and to put them to productive use. In these three areas,
therefore, every business needs objectives: in addition, it needs an
objective for the productivity of these resources. Again, each of these
areas will require a plurality of objectives rather than a single
one.</p>
<p>In respect to human resources, for instance, it is highly desirable
to have specific objectives for manager supply, development, and
performance, but also specific objectives for major groups within the
non-managerial work force, and for relations with labor unions. There is
need for objectives—on employee attitudes as well as on employee
skills.</p>
<p>Similarly a business needs physical facilities, and if a
manufacturer, raw-materials resources. Retail chains, such as Sears,
Roebuck and Marks andandandand Spencer, need an objective for the
development of stores and the utilization of shelf space, but also for
the development of sources of supply for the merchandise they plan to
sell.</p>
<p>The capital area is equally crucial—and very few businesses have yet
tackled it.</p>
<p>Again, objectives are needed for the supply of capital, as well as
for its utilization.</p>
<p>Each of these areas, but especially the areas of human resources, and
of capital, are “marketing areas.” A business markets its job
opportunities, and a business markets its financial investment. The job
and career markets and the capital market are genuine “outside” markets
in which there are true “customers” who have expectations, values, and
needs. A business that cannot attract the people and the capital it
needs will not last long.</p>
<p>The first sign of decline of an industry is loss of appeal to
qualified, able, and ambitious people. The American railroads, for
instance, did not begin their decline after World War II—it only became
obvious and irreversible then. The decline actually set in around the
time of World War I. Before World War I, able graduates of American
engineering schools looked for a railroad career. From the end of World
War I on—for whatever reason—the railroad no longer appealed to young
engineering graduates, or to any educated young people. As a result
there was nobody in management capable and competent to cope with new
problems when the railroads ran into heavy weather twenty years later,
around the time of World War II.</p>
<p>In the two areas of people and capital supply, genuine marketing
objectives are therefore required. “What do our jobs have to be to
attract and hold the kind of people we need and want? What is the supply
available on the job market? And, what do we have to do to attract it?”
Similarly, “What does the investment in our business have to be, in the
form of bank loans, long-term debts or equity, to attract and hold the
capital we need?” (On the career market, see Chapter 33, “Developing
Management and Managers.”)</p>
<p>One American company that systematically and for many years has
applied market planning to the supply of capital is ATandandandandT, the
Bell Telephone System. A telephone business is highly capital-intensive;
it depends on continuing heavy investment. The customer is, in effect,
pre-financed to the tune of three years of future revenues from him. As
one of his last contributions—and one of his most important
ones—Theodore Vail thought through the problem. He realized, at the end
of World War I, that the American capital market, was changing and that
Bell no longer could expect to obtain its capital from the traditional
sources, such as the estates of wealthy Bostonians. Instead, a
mass-capital market was coming into being. As a result of his analysis,
Vail designed a brand-new security, unknown up to this time, and
unparalleled ever since: an ATandandandandT common share with an
almost-guaranteed dividend, which was both an equity investment with a
promise of long-term capital gains and, in large measure, a
fixed-income-producing investment. It thus appealed to a new middle
class which could not afford to risk much, but still had some savings
available for investment after paying for life insurance or home
mortgage.</p>
<p>Forty years later, in the early 1960s, the Bell System’s top
management realized that this investment instrument had ceased to be
appropriate. It drastically changed the nature of the ATandandandandT
common share to make it attractive to the new capitalists, the large
investment institutions, such as pension funds and investment
trusts.</p>
<p>Setting marketing objectives for careers and for investment requires
also objectives for the structure, basic policies, jobs, and directions
of the business itself. They are not selling objectives; they are
genuine marketing objectives, and as such have to be built into the way
the business itself is set up, directed, structured, and run.</p>
<p>Setting objectives also applies to objectives concerning union
relations or workers’ attitudes. Union relations, most executives will
argue, are beyond their control. For short periods of time this is
indeed true. Circumstances beyond any management’s control, e.g.,
governmental policies or inflation, strongly mold union attitudes and
demands, as well as union strength. But this is al1 the more reason for
setting long-range objectives for the relationship with the labor
union.</p>
<p>One may criticize the labor relations policies of General Motors and
General Electric.</p>
<p>But these two companies, alone perhaps among major American
businesses, thought through their union relations, developed objectives
for them, and based their policies on them. The policies, while
basically different in strategy and in tactics, are both very “tough”
ones. Both aim at maintenance of the company’s initiative in labor
relations and of the company’s control of worker assignment and worker
productivity. Both companies are willing to take a strike over matters
of principle and refuse to buy short-term union concessions on money
issues by yielding on long-term fundamentals. Both policies have been
remarkably successful in maintaining productivity and competitive
positions for the two companies. Though labor bitterly criticizes the
two companies and has never ceased to attack their policies, their labor
negotiators are among the few, in major companies, whom labor respects.
Indeed, GM and GE lose fewer man-hours to strikes and slowdowns than
companies enjoying much “better” relationship but relying on short-term
expediency.</p>
<p>Resource objectives have to be set in a double process. One starting
point is the anticipated needs of the business, which then have to be
projected on the outside, that is, on the market for land, labor, and
capital. But the other starting points are these “markets” themselves,
which then have to be projected onto the structure, the direction, the
plans of the business. It is no longer adequate, as most managers still
seem to think, to say, “’This is what we need; how much do we have to
pay for it?” One also has to say, “This is what is available; what do we
have to be, how do we have to behave, to get the fullest benefit?”</p>
<p>Productivity: The First Test of Management’s Competence</p>
<p>Attracting resources and getting them to work is only the beginning.
The task of a business is to make resources productive. Every business,
therefore, needs productivity objectives with respect to each of the
three major resources, land, labor, and capital; and with respect to
overall productivity itself.</p>
<p>A productivity measurement is the best yardstick for comparing
managements of different units within an enterprise, and for comparing
managements of different enterprises. For productivity includes all the
efforts the enterprise contributes; it excludes everything it does not
control. Productivity—is the first test of management’s competence.</p>
<p>All businesses have access to pretty much the same resources. Except
for the rare monopoly situation, the only thing that differentiates one
business from another in any given field is the quality of its
management on all levels. The first measurement of this crucial factor
is productivity, that is, the degree to which resources are utilized and
their yield.</p>
<p>The continuous improvement of productivity is one of management’s
most important jobs. It is also one of the most difficult; for
productivity is a balance between a diversity of factors, few of which
are easily definable or clearly measurable.</p>
<p>The goal is not to try to find the one perfect productivity
measurement, but to use a number of measurements—at least one gains
insights that way. Output per man-hour, for instance, is by itself
almost meaningless, even though governmental statistics in most</p>
<p>countries are based on it. It does not even measure labor
productivity. It becomes meaningful only if the figures show output in
dollars per man-hour, as well as in units, but also profit per man-hour.
In addition, we need figures that show output in units, output in
dollars, that is, sales, profits per dollar of wages, and so on.</p>
<p>Similarly, we need to measure productivity in other areas by a number
of yardsticks to gain insight and judgment. Labor is only one of the
three factors of production. And if productivity of labor is
accomplished by making the other resources less productive, there is
actually loss of productivity.</p>
<p>A telling example is the paper industry worldwide. Very few
industries have enjoyed as much of a rise in demand and sales. Few
industries can match the technical advances of the paper industry, for
instance, the stepup in the speed of paper machines. Since World War II
the industry has been enjoying a boom in sales and output. Yet it has
been unable, in most years, to produce any but marginal profits—well
below what money earns in a savings bank. The break-even point of most
up-to-date paper mills is just barely below 100 percent of capacity
operations. The explanation for this puzzling phenomenon is a long
secular decline in the productivity of capital in the industry. Paper
prices have risen faster than the prices for papermaking equipment. Yet,
where it took 80 cents of capital investment to build productive
capacity for a dollar of paper sales forty years ago, it takes today two
to three dollars of capital investment to produce one dollar’s worth of
paper sales. Labor productivity in the paper industry has gone up much
faster than in most other industries. The paper industry, in other
words, has substituted capital for labor on a massive scale. But the
trade-off was a thoroughly uneconomical one. In fact, the paper industry
represents a massive triumph of engineering over economics and common
sense.</p>
<p>A century ago, Karl Marx based his confident prediction of the
imminent demise of capitalism on the premise that the productivity of
capital is bound to go down. This decline was to Marx the basic
“contradiction of capitalism.” That the prophecy has not been fulfilled
so far is the result of our ability to innovate, that is, to develop new
processes and new industries with higher productivity of capital. But
Marx was right in his basic premise: the key to the survival of a
business, a company, or an economy is, in the last analysis,
productivity of capital. Productivity of capital is the area most
companies pay least attention to—if only because so many people
mistakenly think that profitability by itself measures it.</p>
<p>But, as the Marks andandandand Spencer example shows, the
productivity of physical resources needs to be measured fully as much,
and objectives for each category need to be set. For productivity
includes all three factors of production. The wrong trade-off, that is,
an increase in the productivity of one factor of production paid for by
a disproportionate drop in another factor results, as the paper industry
shows, in a loss of overall productivity.</p>
<p>We do not have one single yardstick. But at least we have a basic
concept that enables us to define productivity for the whole
business—the economist calls it “contributed value.”</p>
<p>Contributed value is the difference between the gross revenue
received by a company from the sale of its products or services and the
amount paid out for the purchase of raw materials and for services
rendered by outside suppliers. Contributed value, in other words,
includes all the costs of all the efforts of the business and the entire
reward received for these efforts. It accounts for all the resources the
business itself contributes to the final product and the appraisal of
their efforts by the market.</p>
<p>Contributed value can be used to analyze productivity only if the
allocation of costs is economically meaningful. The movement in
accounting during the last twenty years from financial accounting and
tax accounting to management accounting, while still only in its early
stages, is thus a major step toward making business manageable and
managed. Contributed value will not measure productivity resulting from
qualitative, rather than quantitative, factors. Contributed value is
strictly a quantitative tool. Yet qualitative factors have major impact
on productivity. Organization structure, for instance, the utilization
of knowledge in the business, or the quality of tomorrow’s management
are fundamental factors in productivity, over the short or the long
range. However, they elude our existing</p>
<p>measurements. Finally, contributed value can be used, by and large,
only in businesses that make something, that is in manufacturing
businesses.</p>
<p>Within these limitations contributed value makes possible the
rational analysis of productivity and the setting of goals for its
improvement. In particular, it makes it possible to apply such tools as
Operations Research to the systematic study of productivity. For these
tools aim at working out alternative courses of action and their
predictable consequences. The productivity problem is always one of
seeing the range of alternative combinations of the various resources,
and of finding the combination that gives the optimal ratio of output to
cost effort and risk. (On this point see Chapter 40, “The Manager and
the Management Sciences.”)</p>
<p>Productivity is a difficult concept, but it is central. Without
productivity objectives, a business does not have direction. Without
productivity measurements, it does not have control.</p>
<p>The Social Dimension</p>
<p>Only a few years ago managers as well as economists considered the
social dimension so intangible that performance objectives could not be
set. We have now learned that the intangible can become very tangible
indeed. Such lessons as consumerism, or the attacks on industry for the
destruction of the environment, are expensive ways to learn that
business needs to think through its impacts and its responsibilities and
to set objectives for both.</p>
<p>The social dimension is a survival dimension. The enterprise exists
in society and economy. Within an institution one always tends to assume
that the institution exists by itself in a vacuum. And managers
inevitably look at their business from the inside. But the business
enterprise is a creature of society and economy. Society or the economy
can put any business out of existence overnight. The enterprise exists
on sufferance and exists only as long as society and economy believe
that it does a job, and a necessary, useful, and productive one.</p>
<p>Again, many managers will say, “This is big-company stuff.” But the
small company is also an employer, also exists in a community, and also
depends on support or at least on sufferance by community and society.
It needs social objectives fully as much as the big business—though it
may need very different ones.</p>
<p>What such objectives might be will be discussed further on (in the
section titled “Social Impacts and Social Responsibilities” beginning
Chapter 24). But that such objectives need to be built into the strategy
of a business, rather than be statements of good intentions, needs to be
stressed here. These are not objectives that are needed because the
manager has a responsibility to society. They are needed because the
manager has a responsibility to the enterprise.</p>
<p>Profit as a Need and a Limitation</p>
<p>Only after the objectives in the above seven key areas have been
thought through and established can a business tackle the question “How
much profitability do we need?” To attain any of the objectives entails
high risks. It requires effort, and that means cost. Profit is,
therefore, needed to pay for attainment of the objectives of the
business. Profit is a condition of survival. It is the cost of the
future, the cost of staying in business.</p>
<p>A business that obtains enough profit to satisfy its objectives in
the key areas is a business that has the means of survival. A business
that falls short of the profitability demands made by its key objectives
is a marginal and endangered business.</p>
<p>The profitability needed to support the objectives of the business in
the seven key areas discussed so far is also the quantitative expression
of the profitability needed to fulfill the social and economic function
of profit:</p>
<p>• as the “risk premium” covering the costs of staying in
business;</p>
<p>• as the source of capital to finance the jobs of’ tomorrow;</p>
<p>• as the source of capital for innovation and for growth of the
economy.</p>
<p>Profit planning is necessary. But it is planning for a needed minimum
profitability rather than for that meaningless shibboleth “profit
maximization.” The minimum needed may well turn out to be a good deal
higher than the profit goals of many companies, let</p>
<p>alone their actual profit results.</p>
<p>The Japanese Example</p>
<p>By historical accident the only economy which understands that profit
is a minimum rather than a maximum concept is the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>There has been heated discussion whether Japan has a lower cost of
capital or a higher cost of capital than the West—the Westerners
contending that Japan’s cost of capital is lower, the Japanese that it
is higher. Both are wrong. The cost of capital of a Japanese business is
pretty much the same as that of a Western business. Only the method of
computation differs.</p>
<p>Japan finances its businesses mostly by bank loans. Legally these are
short-term credits. Economically, they are permanent equity investments
by the bank. The reason for this is that Japan in the nineteenth century
did not have a capital market; the banks were created largely by the
industrial groups to be their suppliers of capital. In the West the
situation is the reverse, the result of the fact that a capital market
existed in England and America when industry started to grow. (The
continental European situation is somewhat in between, as discussed in
Chapter 49, “Georg Siemens and the Deutsche Bank.”)</p>
<p>A Japanese company typically carries 70 percent debt capital and 30
percent equity capital whereas the typical American company in the same
industry has the reverse ratio. The costs of capital for the two are
then as follows: on the 70 percent debt capital, the Japanese company
has to pay at least 10 percent interest, or 7 percent on its total
capital; on the 30 percent equity, it is expected to earn after taxes
about 8 percent, or 2.4 percent on its total capital, making a 9.4
percent rate of return on total capital employed. The American company
has to earn 7 percent (the average for interest rates in the twenty-five
years after World War II) on its 30 percent debt, amounting to 2.1
percent on its total invested capital. It has to earn 10 percent after
taxes on its equity capital, which, at a rate of equity capital of 70
percent of the total, amounts to 7 percent.</p>
<p>Both come out, in other words, at the same overall cost of capital.
(The Japanese carry a much lower tax burden, since interest on loans in
Japan is considered, as in the West, a deductible business expense. The
tax burden is much higher in the West—but whether this is to be
considered as being borne by the business, by the consumer, or by the
investor is a moot point on which economists cannot agree.)</p>
<p>The profitability needed by a Japanese company is what the bank needs
to attract deposits to pay its own operating expense and to cover its
risks. It is the margin between the cost of capital to the bank—maybe 6
percent—and the interest income the bank charges for what, in effect,
are equity investments in the businesses it finances. For the Japanese
business manager the central fact of life is that he has to earn at
least enough to carry the interest on the money he owes to the banks
with a margin adequate to maintain his credit</p>
<p>standing.</p>
<p>The Japanese manager, therefore, starts out with the clear aim to
minimize the capital he needs to operate. He sees profit as a need,
rather than as something desirable and nice to have. He knows that he
will go out of, business if he does not produce the minimum profit
needed to obtain the capital required. He is no less profit-conscious
than the Westerner, but, by historical accident, he is in a position
where he understands the function of profit, and where, therefore, he
tends to plan more rationally and more purposefully to obtain the
profitability on which the survival and growth of his business
depend.</p>
<p>The Japanese illustration shows clearly that the minimum rate of
profitability adequate to the needs of a business is the cost of
capital.* The minimum rate is the capital market rate needed to obtain
the financial resources the business needs to attain its objectives.</p>
<p>In the case of self-financing, which at certain times (e.g., in the
U.S. in the fifties) plays an important part in the supply of capital to
existing businesses, there must be enough profit both to yield the
capital market rate of return on money already in the business and to
produce the additional capital needed. Otherwise the minimum rate of
profitability the business requires will not be produced. As Childs
points out, the fact that the American chemical industry, in the fifties
and sixties, when its cash flow was high, reinvested retained earnings
in ventures yielding less than the cost of capital on the market was a
major reason for its sharp drop in growth in earnings and in ability to
attract capital in the years after 1965.</p>
<p>The cost of capital is never higher than the minimum profitability
needed—at least not when there is a capital market rather than
government allocation of capital. But it might well be lower than the
minimum. It is, however, the best starting point for profit
planning.</p>
<p>Whether the business is large or small, complex or simple,
profitability should be computed as an average of the profits of both
good and bad years. Let us assume that a business needs a profitability
of 20 percent before taxes on its invested capital. If the 20 percent is
being earned in a good year, it is unlikely to be earned over the
lifetime of the investment. We may need a 40 percent return in good
years to average 20 percent over a dozen years. And we have to calculate
how much we actually need to get the desired average.</p>
<p>How to Measure Profitability</p>
<p>How to measure profitability is a much debated question. No one
yardstick will do. Profit on sales, that is, the profit margin, is
clearly not adequate by itself. For profit is profit margin multiplied
by the rate of turnover of capital. Profit margin is a meaningful
figure, if only because it shows where the opportunities for profit
improvement lie. Return on invested capital makes sense; but in practice
it is the worst of all yardsticks—rubber of almost infinite elasticity.
What is “invested capital”? Is a dollar invested in 1950 the same thing
as a dollar invested in 1970? Is capital to be defined by the accountant
as original cash put in less subsequent depreciation? Or is it to be
defined by the economist as future wealth-producing capacity, discounted
at capital-market interest rates to current cash value? The search for a
perfect yardstick for measuring profitability is likely to be
frustrating and futile. It is far sounder to use a number of yardsticks
simultaneously and look at them for what they tell us about the
business, particularly as no one has been able to make a convincing case
for including depreciation in measuring capital investment or, for that
matter, for excluding it.</p>
<p>Profitability as a Limitation</p>
<p>Profitability is not only a need, it is also a limitation. The
objectives of a business must not exceed the profitability with which it
can expect to operate. The minimum profitability must not be so high
that one cannot prudently expect to attain it. The profitability need,
therefore, has to be projected back on the objectives. If profitability
is inadequate to the objectives, the objectives have to be pruned. The
company’s eyes ought not be bigger than its stomach.</p>
<p>Almost any business, in setting objectives in key areas, will come up
with greater efforts and higher risks than it is likely to be able to
support in terms of profitability. Any business, therefore, will have to
balance objectives.</p>
<p>**On this see the excellent though highly technical discussion in
John F. Childs, Earnings per Share and Management Decisions
(Prentice-Hall, 1971). It is perhaps the best treatment of financial
structure and financial policy for the large business written so
far.</p>
<p>Balancing Objectives</p>
<p>There are three kinds of balance needed in setting objectives.
Objectives have to be balanced against attainable profitability.
Objectives have to be balanced as to the demands of the immediate and
the distant future. They have to be balanced against each other, and
trade-offs have to be established between desired performance in one
area and desired performance in others.</p>
<p>In setting objectives, management always has to balance the immediate
future against the long range. If it does not provide for the immediate
future, there will be no long-range future. But if it sacrifices the
long-range needs of “what our business will be” and “what our business
should be” to immediate results, there will also be no business fairly
soon.</p>
<p>Setting objectives always requires a decision on where to take the
risks, a decision as to how much immediate results should be sacrificed
for the sake of long-range growth or how much long-range growth should
be jeopardized for the sake of short-run performance. There is no
formula for these decisions. They are risky, entrepreneurial, uncertain—
but they must be made.</p>
<p>Management has to balance objectives. What is more important, an
expansion in markets and sales volume, or a higher rate of return? How
much time, effort, and energy should be expended on improving
manufacturing productivity? Would the amount of effort or money bring
greater returns if invested in new-product design?</p>
<p>The growth companies of the fifties and sixties promised both more
sales and higher profits indefinitely. This alone was reason to distrust
them. Every experienced manager should have known that these two
objectives are not normally compatible. To produce more sales almost
always means to sacrifice immediate profit. To produce higher profit
almost always means to sacrifice long-range sales. In almost every case,
this irrational promise and the resulting refusal to make balancing
decisions between growth and profitability objectives was the direct
cause of the large losses and the equally large write-offs of the growth
companies in the late sixties and early seventies.</p>
<p>There are few things that distinguish competent from incompetent
management quite as sharply as performance in balancing objectives.
There is no formula for doing the job. Each business requires its own
balance—and it may require a different balance at different times.
Balancing is not a mechanical job. It is risk-taking decision. (For
further discussion of these strategic decisions, see Chapter 10,
“Strategic Planning.”)</p>
<p>The Role of Budgeting</p>
<p>Setting and balancing objectives does require a mechanical
expression. The budget is the instrument, and especially the budget for
managed and capital expenditures.</p>
<p>Budgeting is commonly conceived as a financial process. But only the
notation is financial the decisions are entrepreneurial. Today the
so-called managed expenditures and the capital expenditures are usually
considered quite separate. But the distinction is an accounting (and
tax) fiction and misleading; both expenditures commit scarce resources
to an uncertain future; both are, economically speaking, expenditures of
capital that are investments in the future. To be viable, the
expenditures have to express the same basic decisions on survival
objectives. Finally, today most of our attention in budgets is given, as
a rule, to other than the managed expenses, especially to the so-called
variable expenses, e.g., wages; historically that is where the most
money was being spent. But no matter how large or small the sums,
decisions on the managed expenses determine the future of the
enterprise.</p>
<p>We have little control over what the accountant calls variable
expenses, those which relate directly to units of production and are
fixed by a certain way of doing things. We can change them, but slowly.
We can change a relationship between units of production and labor costs
(which we, with a certain irony, still consider variable expenses
despite the fringe benefits). But within any time period these expenses
can only be kept at a norm and cannot be changed. This is, of course,
even more true for expenses with respect to past decisions, the fixed
expenses. We cannot undo them at all, whether they are the cost</p>
<p>of past capital investment, local taxes, or insurance premiums to
protect assets. They are beyond management’s control.</p>
<p>Setting Priorities</p>
<p>The two budgets regarding the future, capital expenditures and
managed expenditures, also express the priorities which management
sets.</p>
<p>No business can do everything. Even if it has the money, it will
never have enough good people. It has to set priorities. The worst thing
is to try to do a little bit of everything. This makes sure that nothing
is being accomplished. It is better to pick the wrong priority than none
at all.</p>
<p>Setting priorities is risky. For whatever does not receive priority
is, in effect, abandoned.† There is no formula for making the decision,
but it has to be made, and the mechanism far making it is the budgets
far capital and managed expenditures.</p>
<p>From Objectives to Doing</p>
<p>One final step remains: to convert objectives into doing. Action
rather than knowledge is the purpose of asking, “What is our business,
what will it be, what should it be?” and of thinking through objectives.
The aim is to focus the energies and resources of the organization on
the right results. The end product of business analysis, therefore, is a
work program and specific and concrete work assignments with defined
goals, with deadlines, and with clear accountability. Unless objectives
are converted into action, they are not objectives; they are dreams.</p>
<p>Note on Inflation. One additional aspect of profitability should be
mentioned: the impact of inflation on profits. Traditionally it has been
held that productive assets are a hedge against inflation; they are in a
sense. A steel mill will still be standing, capable of producing steel,
even when the currency has gone to rack and ruin. The original cost of
the mill will have become zero or negligible so that a larger share of
its revenue becomes available to the equity owners. Yet this is a
simplistic view: inflation also destroys assets. It creates spurious
profits, profits which in effect represent destruction of capital. In an
inflation, even in very rapid inflations at the rate of 40 or 60 percent
a year, such as many South American countries have been experiencing,
asset values are, as a rule, not adjusted in the books. In fact, in most
countries this, is forbidden (no longer in Brazil, by the way).
Depreciation charges are, therefore, based on yesterday’s currency
value; and, with a shrinking currency, depreciation rapidly becomes
inadequate. Sooner or later, the asset will have to be replaced, and
then the costs in depreciated currency will be many times greater than
the book value. If this loss is not recognized—and few managements are
even aware of it—profits will be shown which, in effect, are
under-depreciation, and dividends will be paid out which are in effect
distributions of capital. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
in the United States long ago recognized this with respect to the
investments of American companies overseas. It demands that the asset
value of such investments—in a subsidiary in Brazil, for instance—be
adjusted each year to reflect the hidden loss. (Paradoxically, the
American tax authorities refuse to accept this adjustment</p>
<p>*The best work in this area, and in microeconomics is still that of
the German Betriebswissenschaft, to which far too little attention has
been paid outside of Germany.</p>
<p>†For a discussion of priority setting, see my book, The Effective
Executive.</p>
<p>and make a business pay taxes on a profit which the SEC has forced it
to show as a loss in its published accounts.)</p>
<p>In an inflationary situation—and that means in most countries at the
present time— inflation should be considered a genuine cost. There is
good reason to adopt, at least for internal purposes, a method of
accounting in “constant dollars” or “constant yen” or “constant marks.”
At least it forces management to realize that inflation rather than its
own performance underlies a good profit showing.</p>
<p>If American companies had used accounting in constant dollars during
the late sixties, most of them would have realized that they produced no
profits, let alone the profit records of these inflation years. Few of
them showed after-tax profits of more than 8 percent on their assets—yet
the U.S. then had an annual 8 percent inflation rate. Had managers
realized this, they would not have been so surprised at the collapse of
the stock market price of the growth companies in 1969-70.</p>

Whether concerned with research or with building a new plant, designing
a new marketing organization or a new product, every major management
decision takes years before it is really effective. And it has to be
productive for years thereafter to pay off the investment of men and
money. Managers, therefore, need to be skilled in making decisions with
long futurity on a systematic basis.</p>
<p>Management has no choice but to anticipate the future, to attempt to
mold it, and to balance short-range and long-range goals. It is not
given to mortals to do well any of these things. But lacking divine
guidance, management must make sure that these difficult
responsibilities are not overlooked or neglected but taken care of as
well as is humanly possible.</p>
<p>The future will not just happen if one wishes hard enough. It
requires decision—now.</p>
<p>It imposes risk—now. It requires action—now. It demands allocation of
resources, and above all, of human resources—now. It requires
work—now.</p>
<p>The idea of long-range planning—and much of its reality—rests on a
number of misunderstandings. The present and the immediate short range
require strategic decisions fully as much as the long range. The long
range is largely made by short-run decisions. Unless the long range is
built into, and based on, short-range plans and decisions, the most
elaborate long-range plan will be an exercise in futility. And
conversely, unless the short-range plans, that is, the decisions on the
here and now, are integrated into one unified plan of action, they will
be expedient, guess, and misdirection.</p>
<p>“Short range” and “long range” are not determined by any given time
span. A decision is not short range because it takes only a few months
to carry it out. What matters is the time span over which it is
effective. A decision is not long range because in the early seventies
we resolve on making it in l985; this is not a decision but an idle
diversion. It has as much reality as the eight-year-old boy’s plan to be
a fireman when he grows up.</p>
<p>The idea behind long-range planning is that “What should our business
be?” can and should be worked on and decided by itself, independent of
the thinking on “What is our</p>
<p>business?” and “What will it be?” There is some sense to this. It is
necessary in strategic planning to start separately with all three
questions. What is the business? What will it be? What should it be?
These are, and should be, separate conceptual approaches. With respect
to “What should the business be?” the first assumption must be that it
will be different.</p>
<p>Long-range planning should prevent managers from uncritically
extending present trends into the future, from assuming that today’s
products, services, markets, and technologies will be the products,
services, markets, and technologies of tomorrow, and, above all, from
dedicating their resources and energies to the defense of yesterday.</p>
<p>Planning what is our business, planning what will it be, and planning
what should it be have to be integrated. What is short range and what is
long range is then decided by the time span and futurity of the
decision. Everything that is “planned” becomes immediate work and
commitment.</p>
<p>The skill we need is not long-range planning. It is strategic
decision-making, or perhaps strategic planning.</p>
<p>General Electric calls this work “strategic business planning.” The
ultimate objective of the activity is to identify the new and different
businesses, technologies, and markets which the company should try to
create long range. But the work starts with the question, “What is our
present business?” Indeed, it starts with the questions “Which of our
present businesses should we abandon? Which should we play down? Which
should we push and supply new resources to?”</p>
<p>This may sound like semantic quibbling—and, to a point, it is. But
the confused semantics have led to confused thinking. They have tended
to paralyze strategic decisionmaking rather than to mobilize for it.
They are largely to blame for the failure of many large companies so far
to obtain results from elaborate planning efforts.</p>
<p>What Strategic Planning Is Not</p>
<p>It is important for the manager to know what strategic planning is
not:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is not a box of tricks, a bundle of techniques. It is analytical
thinking and commitment of resources to action.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many techniques may be used in the process—but, then again, none may
be needed.</p>
<p>Strategic planning may require a computer, but the most important
questions, e.g., “What is our business?” or “What should it be?” cannot
be quantified and programmed for the computer. Model building or
simulation may be helpful, but they are not strategic planning; they are
tools for specific purposes and may or may not apply in a given case.
(See Chapter 40, “The Manager and the Management Sciences.”)</p>
<p>Quantification is not planning. To be sure, one uses rigorous logical
methods as far as possible—if only to make sure that one does not
deceive oneself. But some of the most important questions in strategic
planning can be phrased only in terms such as “larger” or “smaller,”
“sooner” or “later.” These terms while quantitative cannot easily be
manipulated by quantitative techniques. And some equally important
areas, e.g., those of political climate, social responsibilities, or
human (including managerial) resources, cannot be quantified at all.
They can be handled only as restraints, or parameters, but not as
factors in the equation itself.</p>
<p>Strategic planning is not the “application of scientific methods to
business decision”</p>
<p>(as one well-known text on planning defines it). It is the
application of thought, analysis, imagination, and judgment. It is
responsibility, rather than technique.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Strategy planning is not forecasting. It is not masterminding the
future. Any attempt to do so is foolish; the future is unpredictable. We
can only discredit what we are doing by attempting it.</li>
</ol>
<p>If anyone still suffers from the delusion that man is able to
forecast beyond a very short time span, let him look at the headlines in
yesterday’s paper, and ask which of them</p>
<p>he could possibly have predicted a decade or so ago. For example,
could he, in 1960, in the waning days of the Eisenhower Administration,
have forecast the almost explosive growth of the Black middle class in
America, which by 1970, had raised two-thirds of Black families above
the poverty line and had given the American Negro family an average
income well above the average family income of affluent Great
Britain?</p>
<p>Could he have forecast ten years ago that the unprecedented economic
advance of the American Negro—the fastest and most massive economic
advance of any class or ethnic group in American history—would only have
made the race problem more acute and riveted our attention on both the
desperate plight of the remaining Negro poor, and on the remaining
discrimination against the achieving Black?</p>
<p>Could he have predicted the chronic American balance-of-payments
deficit of the 1960s and the world financial crisis of 1971? Could he
have predicted that Britain would stay out of the Common Market until
1973? Could he have predicted the Eurodollar market, by means of which
the European investor has financed the expansion of Americanbased
businesses into Europe? Could he have forecast the rise of consumerism?
Could he have forecast the development of multinational
corporations?</p>
<p>We must start out with the premise that forecasting is not a
respectable human activity and not worthwhile beyond the shortest of
periods. Strategic planning is necessary precisely because we cannot
forecast.</p>
<p>Another, even more compelling reason why forecasting is not strategic
planning is that forecasting attempts to find the most probable course
of events or, at best, a range of probabilities. But the entrepreneurial
problem is the unique event that will change the possibilities; the
entrepreneurial universe is not a physical but a social universe.
Indeed, the central entrepreneurial contribution, which alone is
rewarded with a profit, is to bring about the unique event or innovation
that changes the economic, social, or political situation.</p>
<p>This was what Xerox Corporation did in the fifties when it developed
and marketed photocopying machines. This is what the entrepreneurs in
mobile housing did in the 1960s, when the trailer became the new,
permanent, and immobile home and took over practically the entire U.S.
low-cost housing market. The unique event of Rachel Carson’s book Silent
Spring, in the fifties, changed the attitude of a whole civilization
toward the environment. On the social and political scene, this is what
the leaders of the civil rights movement did in the 1960s, and possibly
what the leaders in women’s rights were doing at the start of the
seventies.</p>
<p>Since the entrepreneur upsets the probabilities on which predictions
are based, forecasting does not serve the purposes of planners who seek
to direct their organizations to the future. It certainly is of little
use to planners who would innovate and change the ways in which people
work and live.</p>
<p>Forecasting is therefore not an adequate basis even for purely
adaptive behavior, let alone for the entrepreneurial decisions of
strategic planning.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Strategic planning does nor deal with future decisions. It deals
with the futurity of present decisions. Decisions exist only in the
present. The question that faces the strategic decision-maker is not
what his organization should do tomorrow. It is, “What do we have to do
today to be ready for an uncertain tomorrow?” The question is not what
will happen in the future. It is, “What futurity do we have to build
into our present thinking and doing, what time spans do we have to
consider, and how do we use this information to make a rational decision
now?”</li>
</ol>
<p>Decision-making is a time machine which synchronizes into one present
a great number of divergent time spans. We are only learning this now.
Our approach still tends toward making plans for something we will
decide to do in the future, which may be entertaining but is futile. We
can make decisions only in the present and yet we cannot make decisions
for the present alone; the most expedient, most opportunistic
decision—let alone the decision not to decide at all—may commit us for a
long time, if not permanently and irrevocably.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Strategic planning is not an attempt to eliminate risk. It is not
even an attempt to minimize risk. Such an attempt can lead only to
irrational and unlimited risks and to certain disaster. Economic
activity, by definition, commits present resources to the future, i.e.,
to highly uncertain expectations. To take risks is the essence of
economic activity. One of the most rigorous theorems of economics
(Boehm-Bawerk’s Law) proves that existing means of production will yield
greater economic performance only through greater uncertainty, that is,
through greater risk.</li>
</ol>
<p>While it is futile to try to eliminate risk, and questionable to try
to minimize it, it is essential that the risks taken be the right risks.
The end result of successful strategic planning must be capacity to take
a greater risk, for this is the only way to improve entrepreneurial
performance. To extend this capacity, however, we must understand the
risks we take. We must be able to choose rationally among risk-taking
courses of action rather than plunge into uncertainty on the basis of
hunch, hearsay, or experience, no matter how meticulously
quantified.</p>
<p>What Strategic Planning Is</p>
<p>We can now attempt to define what strategic planning is. It is the
continuous process of making present entrepreneurial (risk-taking)
decisions systematically and with the greatest knowledge of their
futurity; organizing systematically the efforts needed to carry out
these decisions; and measuring the results of these decisions against
the expectations through organized, systematic feedback.</p>
<p>As such planning, whether long range or short range, is nothing new.
It is the organized performance of an old task. But we have learned that
the task will rarely get done unless organized. Above all, it will
rarely become achievement unless done purposefully.</p>
<p>Sloughing Off Yesterday</p>
<p>Planning starts with the objectives of the business. In each area of
objectives, the question needs to be asked, “What do we have to do now
to attain our objectives tomorrow?” The first thing to do to attain
tomorrow is always to be sloughing off yesterday. Most plans concern
themselves only with the new and additional things that have to be
done—new products, new processes, new markets, and so on. But the key to
doing something different tomorrow is getting rid of the
no-longer-productive, the obsolescent, the obsolete..</p>
<p>The first step in planning is to ask of any activity, any product,
any process or market, “If we were not committed to this today, would we
go into it?” If the answer is no, one says, “How can we get
out—fast?”</p>
<p>Systematic sloughing off of yesterday is a plan by itself—and
adequate in many businesses. It will force thinking and action. It will
make available men and money for new things. It will create willingness
to act.</p>
<p>Conversely, the plan that provides only for doing additional and new
things without provision for sloughing off old and tired ones is
unlikely to have results. It will remain plan and never become reality,
yet getting rid of yesterday is the decision that most longrange plans
in business (and even more in government) never tackle—maybe the main
reason for their futility.</p>
<p>What New Things Do We Have to Do—When?</p>
<p>The next step in the planning process is to ask, “What new and
different things do we have to do, and when?”</p>
<p>In every plan there will be areas where all that is needed—or appears
to be needed—is to do more of what we already do. It is prudent,
however, to assume that what we already do is never adequate to the
needs of the future.* But, “What do we need?” is only half the</p>
<p>*On this see the brilliant essay “Businass Planning as Business
Opportunity” by Michael J. Kami, in Preparing Tomorrow’s Business
Leaders Today. Edited by Peter F. Drucker.</p>
<p>question. Equally important is “When do we need it?” for it fixes the
time for beginning work on the new tasks.</p>
<p>There is indeed a “short” range and a “long” range to every decision.
The time between the commitment to a course of action, e.g., to building
a steel mill, and the earliest possible moment for results, i.e.,
getting finished steel, is the short range of a decision. And the
twenty-plus years it takes before, at the earliest, we get back with
compound interest the money invested in the steel mill is the long
range. The long range is the time during which the initial decision must
remain reasonably valid—as to markets, process, technology, plant
location, etc.—to have been the right decision originally.</p>
<p>But it is meaningless to speak of short-range and long-range plans.
There are plans that lead to action today—and they are true plans, true
strategic decisions. And there are plans that talk about action
tomorrow—they are dreams, if not pretexts for non-thinking,
non-planning, non-doing. The essence of planning is to make present
decisions with knowledge of their futurity. It is the futurity that
determines the time span, and not vice versa.</p>
<p>There are limitations on futurity. In business decisions, the most
precise mathematical statement is often that of my eighth-grade teacher:
Parallels are two lines which do not meet this side of the school yard.
In the expectations and anticipations of a business, the old rule of
statistics usually applies that anything beyond twenty years equals
infinity; and since expectations more than twenty years hence have
normally a present value of zero, they should receive only a minimal
allocation of present efforts and resources.</p>
<p>However, results that require a long gestation period will be
obtained only if initiated early enough. Hence, long-range planning
requires knowledge of futurity: “What do we have to do today if we want
to be in some particular place in the future? What will not get done at
all if we do not commit resources to it today?”</p>
<p>To repeat an oft-used illustration: If we know that it takes
ninety-nine years to grow Douglas firs in the Northwest to pulping size,
planting seedlings today is the only way we can provide for pulp supply
in ninety-nine years. Someone may well develop some speeding-up hormone;
but we cannot bank on it if we are in the paper industry. It is quite
conceivable—perhaps highly probable—that we will use wood primarily as a
source of chemicals long before these trees grow to maturity. The paper
supply thirty years hence may depend on less precious, less highly
structured sources of cellulose than a tree, which is the most advanced
chemical factory in the plant kingdom. This simply means, however, that
forests may put their proprietors into the chemical industry sometime
within the next thirty years and they had better learn now something
about chemistry. If, however, paper plants depend on Douglas fir,
planning cannot confine itself to twenty years, but must consider
ninety-nine years.</p>
<p>For other decisions, even five years would be absurdly long. If our
business is buying up distress merchandise and selling it at auction,
next week’s clearance sale is long-range future; anything beyond is
largely irrelevant to us. Thus, the nature of the business and the
nature of the decision determine the time spans of planning.</p>
<p>Time spans are neither static nor “given.” The time decision itself
is a risk-taking decision in the planning process. It largely determines
the allocation of resources and efforts. It largely determines the risks
taken. One cannot repeat too often that to postpone a decision is in
itself a risk-taking and often irrevocable decision. The time decision
largely determines the character and nature of the business.</p>
<p>To sum up: What is crucial in strategic planning is, first, that
systematic and purposeful work on attaining objectives be done; second,
that planning start out with sloughing off yesterday, and that
abandonment be planned as part of the systematic attempt to attain
tomorrow; third, that we look for new and different ways to attain
objectives rather than believe that doing more of the same will suffice;
and finally, that we think through the time dimensions and ask, “When do
we have to start work to get results when we need them?”</p>
<p>Everything Degenerates into Work</p>
<p>The best plan is only a plan, that is, good intentions, unless it
degenerates into work. The distinction that marks a plan capable of
producing results is the commitment of key people to work on specific
tasks. The test of a plan is whether management actually commits
resources to action which will bring results in the future. Unless such
commitment is made, there are only promises and hopes, but no plan.</p>
<p>A plan needs to be tested by asking managers, “Which of your best
people have you put on this work today?” The manager who comes back (as
most of them do) and says, “But I can’t spare my best men now. They have
to finish what they are doing now before I can put them to work on
tomorrow”—this manager simply admits that he does not have a plan. But
he also proves that he needs a plan, for it is precisely the purpose of
a plan to show where scarce resources—and the scarcest is good
people—should be working.</p>
<p>Work implies not only that somebody is supposed to do the job, but
also accountability, a deadline, and finally the measurement of results,
that is, feedback from results on the work and on the planning process
itself.</p>
<p>In strategic planning, measurements present very real problems,
especially conceptual ones. Yet precisely because what we measure and
how we measure determine what will be considered relevant, and determine
thereby not just what we see, but what we—and others—do, measurements
are all-important in the planning process. Above all, unless we build
expectations into the planning decision in such a way that we can
realize early whether they are actually fulfilled or not—including a
fair understanding of what are significant deviations both in time and
in scale—we cannot plan. We have no feedback, no way of self-control
from events back to the planning process.</p>
<p>The manager cannot decide whether he wants to make risk-taking
decisions with long futurity; he makes them by the definition of his
role. All that is within his power is to decide whether he wants to make
them responsibly or irresponsibly, with a rational chance of
effectiveness and success, or as a blind gamble against all odds. And
both because the decision-making process is essentially a rational
process and because the effectiveness of the entrepreneurial decisions
depends on the understanding and voluntary efforts of others, the
approach will be more responsible and more likely to be effective if it
is rational, organized, and based on knowledge, not prophecy. The end
result, however, is not knowledge but strategy. Its aim is action
now.</p>
<p>Strategic planning does not substitute facts for judgment, does not
substitute science for the manager. It does not even lessen the
importance and role of managerial ability, courage, experience,
intuition, or even hunch just as scientific biology and systematic
medicine have not lessened the importance of these qualities in the
individual physician. On the contrary, the systematic organization of
the planning job and the supply of knowledge to it strengthen the
manager’s judgment, leadership, and vision.</p>
<p>Performance in the Service Institution</p>
<p>The public-service institutions—government agency and hospital,
school and university, armed service and professional associations—have
been growing much faster than businesses in this century. They are the
growth sector of a modern society. And within business, the service
staffs have been growing much faster than the operating units. Yet
performance has not kept up with growth or importance. What explains the
lag in—or absence of—performance in the service institutions? What is
needed to manage service institutions for performance?</p>
<h4 id="the-multi-institutional-society">11 The Multi-Institutional
Society</h4>
<p>Service Institutions Society’s Growth Sector—Service Institutions
within Business— Society, Including Business, Depends on the Performance
of Service Institutions—Are Service Institutions Managed? —Are They
Manageable? —Performance and Results the Exceptions in Service
Institutions—The Importance of the Exceptions—Making the Service
Institution Perform as a Central Managerial Challenge</p>
<p>Business enterprise is only one of the institutions of modern
society, and business managers are by no means our only managers.
Service institutions—government agencies; armed services; schools and
universities; research laboratories; hospitals and other health-care
institutions; labor unions; professional practices such as the large law
firm or the large (and often multinational) accounting firm;
professional, industry, and trade associations, and many others—are
equally institutions and, therefore, equally in need of management. They
all have people who are designated to exercise the management function
and who are paid for doing the management job, even though they may not
be called managers, but administrators, commanders, directors,
executives, or some such title.</p>
<p>These public-service institutions—to give them a generic name—are the
real growth sector of a modern society.</p>
<p>It is not that business has become less powerful, less strong, or
less successful; the others, the service institutions, have
proportionately become more powerful, larger, and, above all, more
important than they were.</p>
<p>We have a multi-institutional society rather than a business society.
The traditional title of the American college courses still tends to
read “Business Government.” But this is an anachronism; it should read
“Business, Government, and Many Others.”</p>
<p>Service Institutions within Business</p>
<p>Within business enterprises, the growth sector has also been “service
institutions.” In every larger business—and many fairly small
businesses—there has been rapid increase in service groups and service
functions, such as staffs, research departments, planning groups,
coordinators, management information systems, and so on. All these are
service institutions rather than operating units. They have no direct
relationship to the economic performance and the results of the
business. While they operate within an economic institution, none of
them produces economic results directly or performs economically by
itself.</p>
<p>These service institutions within business also have managers, of
course. They also need to be managed for performance.</p>
<p>All service institutions are being paid for out of the economic
surplus produced by economic activity. They are overhead—either social
overhead or business overhead. The</p>
<p>growth of the service institutions in this century is thus the best
testimonial to the success of business in discharging its economic task,
i.e., producing economic surplus.</p>
<p>Yet—unlike the early nineteenth-century university—the service
institutions are not luxury or ornament. They are pillars of a modern
society, load-bearing members of the main structure. They have to
perform if society and business are to function. It is not only that
these service institutions are the main expense of a modern society; as
said earlier (Chapters 1 and 3) half of the gross national product of
the U.S. (and of most of the other developed countries) is spent on
public-service institutions. Every citizen in the developed,
industrialized, urbanized societies depends for his survival on the
performance of the public-service institutions. But these institutions
also embody the values of developed societies. Education, health care,
knowledge, and mobility—rather than primarily more food, clothing, and
shelter—are the fruits of our society’s increased economic capacities
and productivity.</p>
<p>The service institutions within business too are—or should
be—load-bearing members of the structure. It is not just their steadily
increasing cost that makes it mandatory for them to be managed for
contribution and performance. Business enterprise depends on the
performance of its service staffs, its planners, researchers,
information specialists, analysts, and accountants.</p>
<p>Yet the evidence for performance in the service institutions is not
impressive, let alone overwhelming. Schools, hospitals, and universities
are all big today beyond the imagination of an earlier generation. Their
budgets have grown even faster. Yet everywhere they are in crisis. A
generation or two ago their performance was taken for granted. Today
they are being attacked on all sides for lack of performance. Services
which the nineteenth century managed with aplomb and apparently with
little effort—the postal service, for instance, or the railroads—are
deeply in the red, require enormous and growing subsidies, and give
poorer service everywhere. Government agencies, both in national and in
local governments, are constantly being reorganized so as to be more
efficient. Yet in every country the citizen complains ever more loudly
of bureaucracy in government. What he means by this complaint is that
the government agency is being run for the convenience of its employees
rather than for contribution and performance. This is mismanagement.</p>
<p>The most persistent critics of bureaucracy in government and in the
public-service institutions tend to be business executives. But it is by
no means certain that business’s own service institutions are any more
effective than the public-service bureaucracies.</p>
<p>In the last twenty years, staff activities, planning departments,
coordinators, and management information systems have snowballed in all
large corporations. Judged by their ability to get their budgets funded,
they have been tremendous successes. Many also have truly impressive
functional knowledge, employ men of great ability and competence, and
are producing a rapidly growing literature. However, it is by no means
clear that many of them make a contribution. Worse still, I would not
know in most cases how to judge their performance or how to measure
their results—nor do they themselves.</p>
<p>As the service staffs have been growing, the whole staff concept has
come under increasing attack. The concept certainly does not perform as
its original designers fifty years ago expected it to work—any more than
the American government agency performs as the liberal enthusiasts of
government activism in the New Deal days of the thirties or the
intellectuals of the Kennedy Administration in the sixties expected it
to perform.</p>
<p>Research activities in business have grown perhaps even faster than
service staffs.</p>
<p>And so has government-sponsored research in the universities and in
separate research institutes. With respect to research, too,
disenchantment has set in. Far too many companies have little to show
except beautiful buildings for all the research money they spent. Worse
still, it is the rare research department that can answer the question,
“And what have you contributed?”—and uncommon to find a research
department that asks this question.</p>
<p>Are Service Institutions Managed</p>
<p>The service institutions themselves have become “management
conscious.” Service institutions increasingly turn to business to learn
management. In all service institutions, manager development, management
by objectives, and many other concepts and tools of business management
are now common.</p>
<p>This is a healthy sign but it does not mean that the service
institutions understand the problems of managing themselves. It only
means that they begin to realize that at present they are not being
managed.</p>
<p>But Are They Manageable?</p>
<p>There is another and very different response to the performance
crisis of the service institutions. A growing number of critics,
especially among the disenchanted liberals of yesterday, have come to
the conclusion that service institutions are inherently unmanageable and
incapable of performance.</p>
<p>The most radical expression of this conclusion is the demand to
de-school society, first voiced by the former priest Ivan Illich, and
most clearly presented by the teacher and educational critic John Holt.*
Schools, Illich and Holt agree, cannot perform and cannot be made to
perform. If only schools were abolished, children would learn.</p>
<p>This is, of course, another “noble savage” fantasy. Society was
“de-schooled” not so long ago—not much more than a century ago. We have
ample documents from this “preschool” era, e.g., the copious
investigations into the life and development of children in early
Victorian England, or in mid-nineteenth-century Germany. There is
precious little support in these documents for the belief that children
will become creative and learn by themselves if only they are not
subjected to the mismanagement of the school. Schools at all levels do
indeed need drastic changes. But what we need is not a “non-school,” but
a properly functioning and properly managed learning institution.†</p>
<p>There is no possibility that we can or will do away with the service
institutions. There is not the slightest evidence that today’s society
is willing to do without the contributions the service institutions are
created to provide. The very people who preach de-schooling society want
more rather than less education. The people who most vocally attack the
shortcomings of the hospitals want more and better health care. The
voters who are most bitter about government bureaucracy vote for more
government programs. Similarly, business is not going to do without the
contribution of knowledge, expertise, and systematic thinking which
service staffs and research departments are intended to furnish.</p>
<p>We have no choice but to learn to manage the service institutions for
performance.</p>
<p>And they can be managed for performance.</p>
<p>The Importance of the Exceptions</p>
<p>Performance in the service institution—whether public service or
service staff in business—is the exception rather than the rule. But
there are exceptions, and they prove that service institutions can
perform.</p>
<p>Several examples of performing service institutions will be discussed
in Chapter 13, “The Exceptions and Their Lessons,” but a few might be
mentioned here. Among American government agencies of the last forty
years, two performers stand out: the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA),
the big regional electric-power and irrigation project in the
Southeastern United States (especially during its early years, in the
thirties and forties, when it was headed by David Lilienthal), and in
the sixties, the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA), which
managed the American space program. Among universities attempting mass
higher education some of the new English “red brick” universities (e.g.,
the University of Bradford, especially in engineering and management
education)</p>
<p>*John Holt, Freedom and Beyond (Dutton, 1972).</p>
<p>†On this see my article “What We Already Know About Tomorrow’s
School,” in Psychology Today, June, 1972.</p>
<p>have been notably effective. While a great many—perhaps most-schools
in the inner-city, Black ghettos of America deserve all the strictures
of the de-schooling movement, a few schools in the very worst ghettos
(e.g., in New York’s South Bronx) have shown high capacity to make the
most disadvantaged children acquire the basic skills of literacy.</p>
<p>What then is it that inhibits the typical service institution from
performing? And what is it that the few performing service institutions
do—or eschew—that makes them capable of performance? These are the
questions to ask, and they are management questions.</p>
<p>Managing the service institutions for performance will increasingly
be seen as the central managerial challenge of a developed society, and
as its greatest managerial need.</p>
<p>The service institution does not differ much from a business
enterprise in any area other than its specific mission. It faces very
similar—if not the same—challenges to make work productive and the
workers achieving. It does not differ significantly from a business in
its social responsibility.</p>
<p>The term social responsibility used to be reserved for the
relationship between business and its social environment. Indeed, the
original term read “the social responsibilities of business.” Recent
events have shown that the service institutions face the same problems
in their relationship with the environment and with society, whether
they be university, government agency, school, or hospital. The worst
polluters today are, after all, governments—local governments with
inadequate sewer plants. That will be discussed later in this book (in
the section titled “Social Impacts and Social Responsibilities”) applies
with little modification to all institutions, public or private.</p>
<p>Nor does the service institution differ very much from business
enterprise with respect to the manager’s work and job, organization
design and structure, or even the job and structure of top management.
Internally the differences tend to be differences in terminology rather
than in substance.</p>
<p>But the service institution is different fundamentally from business
in its “business.” It is different in its purpose. It has different
values. It needs different objectives, and it makes a different
contribution to society. Performance and results are quite different in
a service institution from what they are in a business. Managing for
performance is the one area in which the service institution differs
significantly from a business.</p>
<p>We have no coherent theory of institutions and their management that
would encompass the service institution. Compared to the work done in
business management over the last seventy years, little has been done on
the management of the service institution. All we can attempt so far is
a first sketch.</p>
<p>We do understand why the service institution has difficulty
performing. And we can define what is needed to offset the built-in
obstacles in the service institution to performance and results.</p>
<h4 id="why-service-institutions-do-not-perform">12 Why Service
Institutions Do Not Perform</h4>
<p>The Three Popular Explanations—They Are Not Businesslike—They Need
Better Men—Results Are Intangible—All Three Are Alibis Rather Than
Explanations—What Makes the Service Institution Different—Misdirection
by Budget—What Performance and Results Mean in the Budget-Based
Institution or Staff—Earning One’s Way versus Deserving It</p>
<p>There are three popular explanations for the common failure of
service institutions to perform:</p>
<p>• their managers aren’t businesslike;</p>
<p>• they need better men;</p>
<p>• their objectives and results are intangible.</p>
<p>All three are alibis rather than explanations.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The service institution will perform, it is said again and again, if
only it is managed in a businesslike manner.</li>
</ol>
<p>Colbert, the great minister of Louis XIV, first blamed the
performance difficulties of the non-business, the service institution,
on this lack of businesslike management. Colbert, who created the first
modern public service in the West, never ceased to exhort his officials
to be businesslike. The cry is still repeated every day—by chambers of
commerce, by presidential and royal commissions, by ministers in the
communist countries, and so on. If only, they all say, their
administrators were to behave like businessmen, service institutions
would perform. This belief underlies today’s management boom in the
service institutions. It is the wrong diagnosis, and being businesslike
is the wrong prescription for the ills of the service institution.</p>
<p>To be sure, there is need for efficiency in all institutions. Because
there is usually no competition in the service field, there is no
outward and imposed cost control on service institutions as there is for
business in a competitive (and even an oligopolistic) market. But the
basic problem of service institutions is not high cost but lack of
effectiveness. They may be very efficient—some are. But they tend not to
do the right things.</p>
<p>The belief that the service institution will perform if only it is
put on a businesslike basis underlies the many attempts to set up such
services as separate public corporations—again an attempt that dates
back to Colbert and his establishment of crown monopolies (the so-called
Régies). There may be beneficial side effects such as freedom</p>
<p>from petty civil-service regulation. But the intended main effect,
performance, is seldom achieved. Costs may go down (though not always;
setting up London Transport and the British Post Office as separate
businesslike corporations, and thereby highly vulnerable to labor-union
pressures, has, for instance, led to skyrocketing costs). Services
essential to the fulfillment of the institution’s purpose may be
slighted or lopped off in the name of efficiency.</p>
<p>The best and worst example of the businesslike approach in the
public-service institution may well be the Port of New York Authority,
set up in the twenties to manage automobile and truck traffic throughout
the two-state area (New York and New Jersey) of the Port of New York.
The Port Authority has from the beginning been businesslike with a will.
The engineering of its bridges, tunnels, docks, silos, and, later on,
airports, has been outstanding. Its construction costs have been low and
under control. Its financial standing is extremely high so that it could
always borrow at most advantageous rates of interest. Being
businesslike—as measured above all, by its standing with the banks—is
its goal and purpose. It did not concern itself with transportation
policy in the New York metropolitan area even though its bridges,
tunnels, and airports generate much of the traffic on New York’s
streets. It did not ask, “Who are our constituents?” Instead it resisted
any such question as political and unbusinesslike. In the end it has
come to be seen as the villain of the New York traffic and
transportation problem. When the Port Authority needed help, e.g., in
finding a place for New York’s badly needed fourth airport, it found
itself without a single supporter, except the bankers. Consequently, the
Port Authority may well become politicized—denuded of its efficiency
without gaining anything in effectiveness.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The cry for better people is probably even older than Colbert. It
can be found in the earliest Chinese texts on government. It has been
the constant demand of all American reformers, from Henry Adams, shortly
after the Civil War, to Ralph Nader today. They all have believed that
the one thing lacking in the government agency, is better people.</li>
</ol>
<p>Service institutions can no more than businesses depend on supermen
or lion tamers to staff their managerial and executive positions. There
are far too many institutions to be staffed. It is absurd to expect that
the administrator of every hospital in the world be a genius or even a
great man. If service institutions cannot be run and managed by men of
normal and fairly low endowment; if, in other words, we cannot organize
the task—so that it will be done adequately by men who only try hard; it
cannot be done at all.</p>
<p>There is no reason to believe that the people who staff the
managerial and professional positions in our service institutions are
any less qualified, any less competent or honest, or any less
hard-working than the men who manage businesses. Conversely, there is no
reason to believe that business managers, put in control of service
institutions, would do better than the “bureaucrats.” Indeed, we know
that they immediately become bureaucrats themselves.</p>
<p>In World War II large numbers of American business executives who had
performed very well in their own companies moved into government
positions. Many rapidly became bureaucrats; the men did not change, but
whereas they had been capable of obtaining performance and results in a
business, in government they found themselves primarily producing
procedures and red tape—and deeply frustrated.</p>
<p>An even better proof that there is little to the argument that what
the service institutions need are better people is the French government
service. No other government service can draw on a similar elite for its
senior positions. Positions of influence and importance in the French
government service are reserved for the brilliant graduates of France’s
most prestigious school, the École Polytechnique. Yet few government
services are as ineffectual and as bureaucratic as the French, despite
the brilliant polytechniciens who run them. The fonctionnaire, the
government employee who runs his office to suit his convenience, is the
butt of the most bitter French jokes—and deservedly so, as anyone who
has ever tried to get a French government service to perform knows only
too well. Yet the polytechniciens themselves do not become bureaucrats.
Twenty years after they have entered government service, when they have
risen to the top, most of them traditionally</p>
<p>move over into the top positions in the major French companies and
prove themselves, as a rule, capable of high performance.</p>
<p>The polytechnicien may not be to everybody’s liking. He tends, in the
manner of scholastic elites, to be intellectually arrogant, somewhat
narrow, and rather smug. Yet, the problem of the French government
service is surely not the lack of good men, nor is anything likely to
happen by bringing in better men. The fault is in the system and not in
the men.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The most sophisticated and, at first glance, the most plausible
explanation for the nonperformance of service institutions is the last
one: the objectives of service institutions are “intangible” and so are
their results. This is at best a half-truth.</li>
</ol>
<p>The definition of what “our business is” is always intangible, for a
business as well as for a service institution. To say, as Sears, Roebuck
does, “Our business is to be the informed buyer for the American family”
is intangible. To say, as Marks andandandand Spencer did, “Our business
is to subvert the British class system” is surely not tangible. To say,
as Vail did at Bell Telephone, “Our business is service to the customer”
may sound like pious platitude. At first glance these statements would
seem to defy any attempt at translation into operational, let alone into
quantitative, terms. To say, “Our business is electronic information,”
as Sony of Japan does, is equally intangible, as is IBM’s definition of
its business as data processing. Yet as these businesses have shown, it
is not too difficult to derive from such intangible definitions concrete
and measurable goals and targets.</p>
<p>“Saving souls” as the definition of the objectives of a church is
intangible. At least the bookkeeping is not of this world. But church
attendance is measurable. And so is “getting the young people back into
the church.”</p>
<p>“The development of the whole personality” as the objective of the
school is, indeed, intangible. But “teaching a child to read by the time
he has finished third grade” is by no means intangible and can be
measured easily and with considerable precision.</p>
<p>“To abolish racial discrimination” is equally difficult of clear
operational definition, let alone of measurement. But to increase the
number of Black apprentices in the building trades is a quantifiable
goal, the attainment or non-attainment of which can be measured.</p>
<p>“Economic and social development of an underdeveloped nation” is
intangible. But, “creating 100,000 jobs in five years” or “building
40,000 housing units a year” is tangible indeed.</p>
<p>Achievement is never possible except against specific, limited,
clearly defined targets, in business as well as in a service
institution. Only if targets are defined can resources be allocated to
their attainment, priorities and, deadlines set, and somebody be held
accountable for results. But the starting point for effective work is a
definition of the purpose and mission of the institution, which is
almost always intangible.</p>
<p>“What is our business?” is as ambiguous and as controversial a
question for a business as it is for a service institution. As has been
said earlier, there has to be dissent and controversy before a viable
definition is found. Service institutions have a great many
constituents. The school is of vital concern not only to children and
their parents, but to teachers, to taxpayers, to the community at large.
Similarly the hospital has to satisfy the patient, but also the doctors,
the nurses, the technicians, the patient’s family—and again taxpayers
or, as in the United States, employers and labor unions who together
provide the bulk of the support of most hospitals through their
insurance contributions. But business also has a plurality of
constituencies. Every business, as said before, has at least two
different customers, and often a good many more. And employees,
investors, and the community at large—and management itself—are also
constituencies.</p>
<p>Misdirection by Budget</p>
<p>The one basic difference between a service institution and a business
is the way the service institution is paid.</p>
<p>Businesses (other than monopolies) are paid for satisfying the
customer. They are paid only when they produce what the customer wants
and what he is willing to exchange his</p>
<p>purchasing power for. Satisfaction of the customer is, therefore, the
basis for assuring performance and results in a business.</p>
<p>Service institutions, by contrast, are typically paid out of a budget
allocation. This means that they are not paid for what taxpayer and
customer mean by results and performance. Their revenues are allocated
from a general revenue stream which is not tied to what they are doing
but obtained by tax, levy, or tribute.</p>
<p>This is as true for the service institution within a business as it
is, for instance, for the public school. The typical staff department is
not being paid for its results. It is, as a rule, not even paid
according to the extent to which its customers, that is, the managers,
use it. It is being paid—in many cases inevitably so—out of an overhead
allocation, that is, out of a budget. The fact that the service
institution within a business tends to exhibit the same characteristics
and to indulge in the same behavior as service institutions in the
public sector indicates that it is not business that makes the
difference. It is the mode of payment.</p>
<p>The typical service institution—including most service staffs in
business—are furthermore endowed with monopoly powers. The intended
beneficiary has no choice. Most service institutions have power beyond
what the most monopolistic business enjoys.</p>
<p>If I am dissatisfied with the service of the local power company or
of the telephone company, I have no other place to go to for electric
power or telephone service. But if I choose to do without either power
or telephone, I do not have to pay for it; and one can still survive as
an individual without either—though this freedom is increasingly
theoretical rather than practical. This choice is not true, however, of
most service institutions. There the customer pays whether he wants to
use the service or not. Behind the service institution stands the police
power of the state, which exacts payment, not for services rendered but
for the support of a governmental agency.</p>
<p>Most service staffs in business have coercive monopoly power too.
Operating managers know that they are largely being judged by how well
they cooperate with the staff services; and only rarely are they
permitted to go elsewhere than their own company’s staff service for
advice or expertise in the staff service’s area.</p>
<p>The American household pays school taxes whether it has children of
School age or not. Parents may choose to send their children to a
private or a parochial school but they still pay taxes for the public
school, even though they do not use it and consider it inappropriate or
unsatisfactory for their own children.</p>
<p>Being paid out of a budget allocation changes what is meant by
performance, or results. Results in the budget-based institution mean a
larger budget. Performance is the ability to maintain or to increase
one’s budget. Results, as the term is commonly understood, that is,
contributions to the market or achievement toward goal and objectives,
are, in effect, secondary. The first test of a budget-based institution
and the first requirement for its survival is to obtain the budget. And
the budget is not, by definition, related to contribution but to good
intentions.</p>
<p>When Efficiency Is a Sin</p>
<p>Efficiency and cost control, however much they are being preached,
are not really considered virtues in the budget-based institution. The
importance of a budget-based institution is measured essentially by the
size of its budget and the size of its staff. To achieve results with a
smaller budget or a smaller staff is, therefore, not performance. It
might actually endanger the institution. Not to spend the budget to the
hilt will only convince the budget maker—whether legislature or the
budget committee of a company—that the budget for the next fiscal period
can, safely be cut.</p>
<p>Thirty or forty years ago it was considered characteristic of Russian
planning, and one of its major weaknesses, that Soviet managers, toward
the end of the plan period, engaged in a frantic effort to spend all the
money allocated to them, which usually resulted in total waste. Today
the disease has become universal as budget-based institutions have
become dominant everywhere. End-of-year pressure on the executive of a
budget-based institution</p>
<p>certainly accounts for a good deal of the waste in the American
defense effort. And “buying-in,” that is, getting approval for a new
program or project by grossly underestimating its total cost, is also
built into the budget-based institution.</p>
<p>“Parkinson’s Law” lampooned the British Admiralty and the British
Colonial Office for increasing their staffs and their budgets as fast as
their work and role were shrinking, that is, as fast as the British Navy
and the British Empire went down. Parkinson’s Law attributed this to
inborn human perversity. But it is perfectly natural behavior for
someone on a budget. It is the budget, after all, that measures
performance and importance.</p>
<p>It is not compatible with efficiency for the acid test of performance
to be obtaining the budget; that as a consequence, administrators are
subtly discouraged from trying to do the job cheaply and efficiently,
and are, indeed, likely to be penalized for doing so; and that they are
forever encouraged to “buy in.” Yet these are the consequences of being
budgetbased.</p>
<p>But effectiveness is even more endangered by reliance on the budget
allocation. It makes it dangerous to raise the question what the
business of the institution should be. The question is always
controversial; but controversy is likely to alienate support and will,
therefore, be shunned by the budget-based institution. At best the
institution will achieve effectiveness by deceiving the public and
itself.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, for instance, has never been
willing to ask whether its goal should be farm productivity or support
of the small family farm. It has known for decades that these two
objectives are not identical as had originally been assumed, and that
they are becoming increasingly incompatible. To admit this, however,
would have created controversy that might have endangered the
Department’s budget. As a result, American farm policy has frittered
away an enormous amount of money and human resources on what can only
(and charitably) be called a public relations campaign, that is, on a
show of support for the small family farmer. Its effective activities,
however—and they have been very effective indeed—have been directed
toward eliminating the small family farmer and replacing him by the far
more productive “agrobusinesses,” that is, large, highly capitalized and
highly mechanized farms, run as businesses and not as a “way of life.”
This emphasis may have been right, but it was not what the Department
was founded to do, nor what the legislators, in approving the
Departments budget, expected it to do.</p>
<p>The farm policy of the Common Market today faces the same
dilemma—and, again, tries to obscure it by substituting money for
policy, and public relations for performance.</p>
<p>The American community hospital is not governmental but private,
though nonprofit.</p>
<p>Yet, like hospitals everywhere, it presents the same confusion of
missions and objectives, with the resulting impairment of effectiveness
and performance.</p>
<p>Should a hospital be, in effect, a physician’s plant facility—as most
older American physicians maintain? Should it be a community health
center? Should it focus on the major health needs of a community or try
to do everything and be abreast of every medical advance, no matter how
costly and, how rarely used the facility will be? Should it focus on
preventive medicine and on health education for the community? Or should
it concentrate on the repair of health damage that has already been
done?</p>
<p>Every one of these definitions of the business of the hospital can be
defended. Every one deserves a hearing. The effective hospital will
certainly be a multipurpose institution and strike a balance between
various objectives. What most hospitals do, however, is pretend that
there are no basic questions to be decided. The result, predictably, is
confusion and impairment of the capacity of the hospital to serve any
function and to carry out any mission.</p>
<p>A service organization within a business has the same tendency to
avoid controversy over function, mission, and objectives.</p>
<p>Is it the first function of the personnel department to obtain the
most effective utilization of the company’s human resources? Or is the
personnel department a welfare department and babysitter? Is the purpose
of the personnel department to make employees accept the policies,
rules, and regulations of the company? Or is the purpose to help de-</p>
<p>velop the organization structure and job structure that make sense
for the employee and will enable him to develop and achieve? All these
are legitimate definitions of the personnel job. Each could be the
foundation for a truly effective personnel department. But practically
no personnel department I know will face up to these questions. They are
controversial. As a result, the personnel department says different
things to different constituents. It is likely to end up ineffectual and
frustrated.*</p>
<p>Being dependent on a budget allocation militates against setting
priorities and concentrating efforts, yet nothing is ever accomplished
unless scarce resources are concentrated on a small number of
priorities.</p>
<p>A shoe manufacturer who has 22 percent of the market for work shoes
may have a profitable business. If he succeeds in raising his market
share to 30 percent, especially if the market for his kind of footwear
is expanding, he is doing very well indeed. He need not concern himself
too much with the 70 percent of the users of work shoes who buy from
somebody else. And the customers for ladies’ fashion shoes are of no
concern to him at all.</p>
<p>Contrast this with the situation of an institution on a budget. To
obtain its budget, it needs the approval, or at least the acquiescence,
of practically everybody who remotely could be considered a constituent.
Where a market share of 22 percent might be perfectly satisfactory to a
business, a rejection by 78 percent of the constituents—or even a much
smaller proportion—would be absolutely fatal to a budget-based
institution. It might survive if 22 percent of its constituents do not
actively support it. But it certainly would consider itself in serious
danger if it could not get a larger base of support, or at least of
acquiescence. And this means that the service institution cannot
concentrate; it must instead try to placate everyone.</p>
<p>An extreme case is the police department in the large American city.
It knows what its priorities should be. In the residential neighborhood,
for instance, the first priority might be safety on the streets. This is
an attainable goal—what is needed primarily is an increase in the number
of policemen on patrol. In the slums of the inner city, the first
priority would probably be safety in the home, that is, protection
against rape, burglary, and theft. This is a much more difficult
objective to attain, especially in crowded tenements, with their large
numbers of drug addicts desperate for money, though measurable progress
toward the goal can be made. But there is the old lady who phones in
that a cat is caught in a tree outside her home. There is the
respectable householder who has locked himself out and wants the police
to open his door for him. There is the householder who complains about
the noisy party next door, and so on. Every desk sergeant who answers
such calls knows that he should say, “We are public servants, not
private servants,” but this answer is never given. The old lady, after
all, would immediately telephone her councilman and complain that she, a
taxpayer, does not even receive courteous treatment from the police. As
a result, every police force in the country, while it knows what the
priorities should be and where it should concentrate its slender
resources, splinters itself indeed, it may have no choice. This means,
however, that there is neither safety on the streets in the residential
suburb nor safety in the home in the slums.</p>
<p>Finally, being budget-based makes it even more difficult to abandon
the wrong things, the old, the obsolete. As a result, service
institutions are even more encrusted than businesses with the barnacles
of inherently unproductive efforts.</p>
<p>No institution likes to abandon anything it does. Business is no
exception. In an institution that is being paid for its performance and
results and that stands, therefore, under a performance test, the
unproductive, the obsolete, will sooner or later be killed off by the
customers. In a budget-based institution no such discipline is being
enforced. On the contrary, what such an institution does is always
virtuous and likely to be considered in the public interest.</p>
<p>The temptation is great, therefore, to respond to lack of results by
redoubling efforts.</p>
<p>The temptation is great to double the budget, precisely because there
is no performance.</p>
<p>*On this see Chapter 23.</p>
<p>The temptation, above all, is to blame the outside world for its
stupidity or its reactionary resistance, and to consider lack of results
a proof of one’s own righteousness and a reason in itself for keeping on
with the good work.</p>
<p>The tendency to perpetuate the unproductive is by no means confined
to service institutions in the public sector. It is just as common in
staff services within today’s large business enterprise. The
organization planner, the computer specialist, or the operations
researcher all tend to argue that the resistance of operating managers
to their wares is prima facie evidence of the need for their services
and reason for doubling the “missionary effort.” Sometimes this argument
is, of course, valid. But more often than not it makes impossible
concentration of efforts on the areas where performance and results are
both needed and attainable.</p>
<p>All service institutions are threatened by the tendencies to cling to
yesterday rather than to slough it off, and to put their best and ablest
people on defending what no longer makes sense or serves a purpose.
Government is particularly prone to this disease.*</p>
<p>Underlying traditional political theory is the axiom that the
functions of government are eternal. There is an implicit belief, held
almost with the strength of dogma, that whatever government does is for
all times. Yet government is a human activity. Everything human beings
do, except their biological and spiritual functions, obsoletes sooner or
later. The proper rule for government today as for all other
institutions, is not, “Whatever we do we’ll do forever”; the proper rule
is, “Whatever we do today will in all likelihood be a candidate for
abandonment within a fairly short period of years.”</p>
<p>Earned or Deserved Revenue</p>
<p>Human beings will behave as they are being rewarded—whether the
reward is money and promotion, a medal, the autographed picture of the
boss, or a pat on the back. This is the one lesson the behavioral
psychologist has taught us during the last fifty years (not that it was
unknown before). A business or any institution which is paid for its
results and performance in such a way that the dissatisfied or
disinterested customer need not pay has to earn its income. An
institution which is financed by a budget—or which enjoys a monopoly
which the customer cannot escape—is rewarded for what it deserves rather
than for what it earns. It is paid for good intentions and for
“programs.” It is paid for not alienating important constituents rather
than for satisfying any one group. It is misdirected by the way it is
being paid into defining performance and results as what will produce
the budget rather than as what will produce contribution.</p>
<p>This is an inherent characteristic of the budget-based institution.
Amazingly enough, it has escaped the attention of the economists—perhaps
because so few of them seem to be aware of the fact that upwards of 50
percent of the gross national product these days does not go to
businesses, that is, to institutions paid for performance but rather to
service institutions paid for promises or, at best, for efforts.</p>
<p>Being based on a budget is not necessarily bad or even undesirable.
Self-supporting armies, for instance, such as the armies of the
fifteenth century or the traditional armies of the Chinese warlords, had
forever to engage in warfare, terrorize the citizens of their own
nation, and depend on looting and raping for their support. Such armies
can never be instruments of policy. Civilian control and defense budgets
paid out of taxes were instituted precisely to stop free enterprise in
warfare.</p>
<p>Similarly, most service staffs in business will have to be on a
budget allocation. It is the only desirable basis for a research
laboratory. To pay a research laboratory for results, for instance, in
the form of a royalty on the sales of the new products and processes it
produces (as has been tried in several businesses) is almost certain to
misdirect the research laboratory even more than the budget allocation
does. It is likely to deflect resources from research into gadgetry. But
there is also no question that budget allocation induces research
directors to inflate the research staff, to come up with an impossible
list</p>
<p>*See on this my book, The Age of Discontinuity (1969), especially
Chapter 6, “The Sickness of Government.”</p>
<p>of projects, and to hang on to projects which are unlikely to produce
results or which have proven unproductive. However necessary or even
desirable, being paid out of a budget allocation misdirects. So does
being paid for efforts—as are hospitals or universities— that is, for
costs rather than for results.) In many, perhaps in most cases, this
cannot be eliminated. But it can be limited, counteracted, and, in large
measure, even offset.</p>
<h4 id="the-exceptions-and-their-lessons">13 The Exceptions and Their
Lessons</h4>
<p>The Exceptions: Bell Telephone; the Nineteenth-Century American
University; TVA; Meiji Japan—The Market Approach and “Socialist
Competition” —The Limits of the Market— “Public Policy” Is Not
Enough—The Special Problem of the Old, Obsolete, and Unproductive—The
Danger of Yesterday’s Success</p>
<p>The exception, the comparatively rare matters as much as the great
majority</p>
<p>service institution that achieves effectiveness, which achieve only
procedures. For the excep-</p>
<p>tion provides the lessons. It shows that effectiveness in the service
institution is achievable—though by no means easy. It shows what
different kinds of service institutions can do and need to do. It shows
limitations and pitfalls. But it also shows that the service-institution
manager can do unpopular and highly controversial things only if he
himself faces up to the risk-taking decision as to what the business of
his institution is, will be, and should be.</p>
<p>Bell Telephone</p>
<p>The first and perhaps simplest example is that of the Bell Telephone
System. A telephone system is a natural monopoly. Within a given area,
one supplier of telephone service must have exclusive rights. The one
thing any subscriber to a public telephone service requires is access to
all other subscribers, which means territorial exclusivity for one
monopolistic service. As a whole country or continent becomes in effect
one telephone system, this monopoly has to be extended over larger and
larger areas.</p>
<p>An individual may be able to do without a telephone—though in today’s
society only at prohibitive inconvenience. But a professional man, a
tradesman, an office, or a business must have a telephone. Residential
phone service may still be an option. Business phone service is
compulsory.</p>
<p>Theodore Vail, as has been said earlier, saw this in the early years
of this century. He also saw that the American Telephone Company, like
the telephone systems in all other industrially developed nations, could
easily be taken over by government. To prevent this, Vail thought
through what the telephone company’s business was and should be, and
came up with his famous definition: “Our business is service.”</p>
<p>This statement of the Telephone Company’s business then enabled Vail
to set specific goals and objectives and to develop measurements of
performance and results in terms of his definition of what the business
was and should be. His customer-satisfaction standards and
service-satisfaction standards created, in effect, nationwide
competition between telephone managers in various areas. The standards
became the measurements by which the managers were judged and rewarded.
As a result, the Telephone Company’s managers were directed, despite the
monopolistic nature of their company, toward performance and
results.</p>
<p>Vail’s solution worked for more than half a century. Until the
inflationary squeeze of the sixties, the Bell System steadily improved
service while lowering rates.</p>
<p>Vail did something even more heretical for his day (and, by and
large, even for this day). He identified Bell’s constituencies. The
regulatory agencies, i.e., the public utility commissions of the various
states, had been considered “pernicious socialism” and the “enemy” by
any right-thinking businessman of his day. Vail, however, decided that
the public was, indeed, a legitimate constituency, so that it was the
job of the telephone company to make the regulatory agencies function.
He tried to think through what their objectives were and should be.
There is little doubt that the Bell System would have been nationalized
long ago if the American public did not feel that the regulatory
agencies had been doing their job, albeit fitfully. There is also little
doubt that but for Vail and his recognition of the regulatory agencies
as a distinct constituency, the American public utility commissions
would never have acquired the capacity to function and the ability to
understand their own work.*</p>
<p>The American University</p>
<p>The building of the modern American university from 1860 to World War
I also illustrates how service institutions are made to perform. The
American university as it emerged during that period is primarily the
work of a small number of men: Andrew W. White (president of Cornell,
1868-1885); Charles W. Eliot (president of Harvard, 18691909); Daniel
Coit Gilman (president of Johns Hopkins, 1876-1901); David Starr Jordan
(president of Stanford, 1891-1913); William Rainey Harper (president of
Chicago, 18921904); and Nicholas Murray Butler (president of Columbia,
1902-1945).</p>
<p>These men all had in common one basic insight: the traditional
college—essentially an eighteenth-century seminary to train
preachers—had become totally obsolete, sterile, and unproductive. It was
dying fast; America in 1860 had far fewer college students than it had
had forty years earlier for a much smaller population. The men who built
the new universities shared a common objective: to create a new
institution, a true university. They all realized that while European
examples, especially Oxford and Cambridge and the German universities,
had much to offer, these new universities had to be American
institutions.</p>
<p>Beyond these shared beliefs, however, they differed sharply on what a
university should be and what its purpose and mission were.</p>
<p>Eliot, at Harvard, saw the purpose of the university in educating a
leadership group with a distinct style. His Harvard was to be a national
institution rather than the parochial preserve of the “proper
Bostonian,” for whom Harvard College had been founded. But it also was
to restore Boston—and to New England—the dominance of a moral elite,
such as had been held by the “Elect,” the Puritan divines, and their
successors, the Federalist leaders in the early days of the Republic.
Butler at Columbia—and to a lesser degree Harper at Chicago—saw the
function of the university as the systematic application of rational
thought and analysis to the basic problems of a modern
society—education, economics, government, foreign affairs. Gilman at
Johns Hopkins saw the university as the producer of advanced knowledge;
originally Johns Hopkins was to confine itself to ad-</p>
<p>*What the “Regulatory Commission” is may need a word of explanation
even for American readers: outside the U.S. the institution is largely
unknown. First devised in the 1880s to regulate railroads and grain
terminals, the function of the regutatory agency is to make private
enterprise function in the public interest under conditions of “natural”
monopoly where competition cannot efiectively do the job. These
agencies, by and large, have three functions: to maintain as far as
feasible competition in a service area; to protect the public against
exploitation by “natural” monopolies through control of prices and
service standards; and to limit the earnings of “natural” monopolies,
whether railroads, airlines, power companies, or broadcasters, to a
“fair return” geared to the cost of capital. The “regulatory agency”
thus presents an attempt to find a “third way” between the uncontrolled
private monopoly and—equally uncontrolled—government monopoly.
Regulatory commissions exist both at the federal level and in the
various states; the commissioners are either government-appointed (as on
all federal commissions) or elected, as in many states.</p>
<p>vanced research and was to give no undergraduate instruction. White
at Cornell aimed at producing an educated public, and so on.</p>
<p>Each of these men knew that he had to make compromises. Each knew
that he had to satisfy a number of constituencies and publics, each of
whom looked at the university quite differently. Both Eliot and Butler,
for instance, had to build their new universities on existing, old
foundations (the others could build from the ground up) and had to
satisfy— or at least to placate—existing alumni and existing faculty.
They all had to be exceedingly conscious of the need to attract and hold
financial support.</p>
<p>It was Eliot with all his insistence on “moral leadership” who
invented the first placement office and set out to find for the Harvard
graduates well-paid jobs, especially in business. It was Butler,
conscious that Columbia was a latecomer and that the millionaire
philanthropists of his day had already been snared by his competitors
(e.g., Rockefeller by Chicago), who invented the first public relations
office in a university, designed—and most, successfully—to reach the
merely well-to-do and get their money.</p>
<p>Each of these men gave priority to his definition of the university’s
purpose and mission. These definitions did not outlive the founders.
Even during the lifetime of Eliot and Butler, for instance, their
institutions escaped their control, began to diffuse objectives and to
confuse priorities. In this century all these universities—and many
others, e.g., California and other major state universities—have
converged toward a common type.</p>
<p>Today it is hard to tell one “multiversity” from another. Yet the
imprint of the founders has still not been totally erased. It is hardly
an accident that the New Deal picked primarily faculty members from
Columbia and Chicago to be high-level advisers and policy-makers; for
the New Deal was, of course, committed to the application of rational
thought and analysis to public policies and problems. Thirty years later
when the Kennedy Administration came in with an underlying belief in the
“style” of an elite, it naturally turned to Harvard.</p>
<p>In 1860 higher education in America hardly existed; and what existed
was discredited and unsupported by the public. By 1900 the American
university had become established as a leader, a major power center, and
as an intellectual, social, and political authority. In 1860 America had
a smaller proportion of its young people in college than any other
leading country; by 1900 it already had a larger proportion in its
colleges and the foundations for mass higher education were being laid.
In 1860 America depended for scholarship, research, and science on
Europe; Americans who distinguished themselves in such pursuits (e.g.,
Francis Parkman as a historian, Emerson as a philosopher, or Joseph
Henry as a physicist) had no university connection. And America’s pride
was the self-taught inventors. By 1900 America had attained both
achievement and self-confidence in scholarship, research, and science.
Men of intellectual or scientific distinction (e.g., William James in
philosophy, John Dewey in education, Charles Heard and Frederick J.
Turner in history, Albert Michelson in physics) were all members of a
university. At the same time the American university of 1900 was a
distinctly American institution, no matter how many of its professors
had done their graduate work in Germany, or how many could be heard to
sigh for the Oxford amenities of high table and port.</p>
<p>What underlay this example of high effectiveness and high achievement
was, above all, a clear commitment to one specific definition of purpose
and mission.</p>
<p>Lilienthal and the TVA</p>
<p>A different but equally instructive example is that of the Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA, the public utility and public works complex in
the south-central United States). Built mainly in New Deal days, the TVA
today is no longer controversial. It is just another large power company
except for being owned by the government rather than by private
investors. This was not the case in its early days, forty years ago.
Then the TVA was a slogan, a battle cry, a symbol. Some, friends and
enemies alike, saw in it the opening wedge of the nationalization of
electric energy in the United States. Others saw in it the vehicle for a
return to Jeffersonian agrarianism based on cheap power, government</p>
<p>paternalism, and free fertilizer. Others still were primarily
interested in flood control and navigation. There was such a wealth of
conflicting expectations that TVA’s first head, Arthur Morgan, a
distinguished engineer and economist, floundered completely. Unable to
think through what the business of the TVA should be and how varying
objectives might be balanced, Morgan accomplished nothing. Finally,
President Roosevelt replaced him with an almost totally unknown young
lawyer with little previous experience as an administrator, David
Lilienthal.</p>
<p>Lilienthal faced up to the need to define TVA’s business. He
concluded that the first objective was to build truly efficient electric
plants and to supply an energy-starved region with plentiful and cheap
power. All the rest, he decided, hinged on the attainment of this first
need, which then became his operational priority. Today TVA has
accomplished many other objectives as well, flood control, navigable
waterways, fertilizer production, and even balanced community
development. But it was Lilienthal’s insistence on a clear definition of
TVA’s business and on setting priorities that explains why TVA is now
taken for granted, even by those who, forty years ago, were its
implacable enemies.</p>
<p>The Lesson of Meiji</p>
<p>The most important example of service-institution performance may be
the development of Japan in the second half of the nineteenth century,
after the so-called Meiji Restoration of 1868. Thirty years later Japan,
previously an exceedingly poor and largely rural country, encased in a
rigid straitjacket of class and caste, had become a modern nation, a
major military power capable of defeating Imperial Russia, and a major
factor in world trade. At the same time it had become the first country
in which illiteracy was virtually unknown.</p>
<p>The Meiji statesmen, patriots, and business leaders who brought about
this transformation included no more than a handful of truly remarkable
men. But, of course, these were still a tiny minority even within the
leadership group. The job was done by ordinary, competent, hard-working
men. What explains their success was the willingness of the Meiji
generation to think through objectives, to set a few priorities, and to
concentrate on them.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Meiji Restoration was defined as the preservation
of Japanese independence and of Japanese culture and tradition in a
world dominated by Western imperialism. These objectives were summarized
in the slogan “a wealthy country, a strong army,” which required general
literacy and uniform local administration and justice throughout the
country. The five goals of economic growth, modern army and navy,
literacy, uniform local government, and a strong professional judiciary
became the priorities on which the men of Meiji concentrated.</p>
<p>One can quarrel with these priorities—a great many Japanese and
foreign critics have done so. Little was done, for instance, to improve
the peasant’s lot or to cushion the poor against the upheavals of
forced-draft industrialization. Little was done to make the highly
literate new Japanese middle class capable of self-government. The men
of Meiji were conscious of these omissions but they decided deliberately
that there had to be priorities, thought through what they should be,
and then concentrated on them the energies of a gifted, hard-working,
and patriotic people.</p>
<p>There are other examples. To illustrate effectiveness in a
university, for instance, Wilhelm von Humboldt’s founding of the
University of Berlin in the darkest days of German defeat by Napoleon
might be mentioned. Another example, as said before, is some of the new
English “red brick” universities, founded since World War II as a
result, largely, of the thinking on objectives and priorities done by a
distinguished economist, Lionel Robbins. The few New York ghetto schools
in which the kids learn have also been mentioned earlier. Another
example from education would be the Folk High School, which the Danish
Bishop Nikolaj Grundtvig conceived almost 150 years ago, and which
became the foundation both for the evolution of the Scandinavian
countries into model democracies and for all continuing education today.
I might have taken a few examples of service effectiveness from other
areas, e.g., health care or research labs.</p>
<p>Each of these effective public-service institutions can be said to be
sui generis. Each is certainly completely different. But these examples
demonstrate that service institutions can be managed for
performance.</p>
<p>Market Approach and “Socialist Competition”</p>
<p>Our examples illustrate, first, that the task cannot be accomplished
on the basis of either one of the traditional and prevailing approaches.
Neither the approach that says “Let the market do the job” nor the one
that says “Let public interest prevail and drive the moneychangers out”
can work for the budget-based service institution.</p>
<p>The market approach is commonly considered “capitalist.” But it is a
misunderstanding. The market approach can equally be “socialist.”
Whether ownership is in capitalist hands or not is no longer primary.
What matters is managerial autonomy and accountability. What matters is
whether resources are being allocated to produce results and on the
basis of results.</p>
<p>The prevailing idea that the U.S. economy is capitalistic because
ownership is private is a misunderstanding. Decisive ownership of
American big business is in the hands of the people—that is, in the
hands of the mutual funds and pension funds who are the fiduciaries for
the middle class and workers. Big business in the U.S. has not been
nationalized, but it has largely, been socialized. In terms of the
classical definition, the U.S. is, at best, a mixed and may steadily be
approaching a socialist economy in which the public owns the means of
production. But the U.S. manages largely on the basis of local autonomy
of the enterprise and allocates resources on the basis of results. It is
still a market economy.</p>
<p>Japan conforms even less to the traditional identification of
ownership as the determinant. If anyone in Japan can be said to own the
big companies, it would be their employees and especially their
managers. Since they cannot be dismissed but have lifetime employment,
they are what the law calls the beneficial owners even though they have
no legal title. Yet, Japan is clearly not a socialist economy.</p>
<p>The most searching discussion of market economics in the last fifty
years has not been conducted in the free-enterprise countries or in the
free-enterprise camp. It has been the discussion of what is known as
socialist competition, that is, competition in an economy in which the
means of production are not owned by private capitalists.</p>
<p>This discussion goes back to the years immediately following World
War I when the Social Democrats, newly in power, expected to nationalize
German business. They set up a powerful Socialization Commission to work
out the transition from a capitalist to a socialist economy. The
economists on the Socialization Commission were themselves mostly
committed socialists. But they had also experienced first-hand the
inefficiency, ineffectiveness, and wastefulness of Germany’s planned
economy during World War I. Instead of a blueprint of a socialist
economy, they produced what can only be called a “capitalist
manifesto.”*</p>
<p>The German Socialization Commission did advocate strong direction by
government, but for the economy itself it recommended a basically
oligopolistic market economy, in which large privately owned and
privately managed companies would compete with each other in each major
market.†</p>
<p>This, of course, was totally unacceptable to orthodox Marxists, but
the logic was unassailable. Government monopolies, the Germans had shown
conclusively, would not produce and would not build a strong
economy.</p>
<p>The Russian planning approach, developed a few years later, was
designed to answer and to confute this heresy. Another answer,
however—and one of greater subtlety and</p>
<p>*A striking parallel is the impact of World War II on American
economists. Most of the economists who joined the World War II
economic-control agencies were inclined toward planning and controls
when they went in. Their formative experiences and background were,
after all, the Depression years. But most came out of the World War II
agencies as confirmed enemies of controls and believers in the market,
at least as the lesser evil. †This blueprint, by the way, bears a
striking resemblance both to what Adenauer’s Germany after World War II
adopted as “social market economy” and to the way today’s Japan actually
runs its “free economy.”</p>
<p>importance—was given by a Polish Marxist, Oscar Lange (who for many
years taught at the University of Chicago, before returning after World
War II to die in his native country), who called his alternative
“socialist competition.” Lange’s model provides for public ownership’ of
the means of production, thus eliminating the capitalist. But it also
provides for autonomous businesses, under their own managements,
competing in a market economy and getting paid for results. What Lange
said, in other words, is that socialist doctrine demands that ownership
be socialized. But the allocation of resources has to be done by
performance and results, that is, on the basis of the market test, if an
economy is to allocate its resources rationally and be capable of
performance.</p>
<p>The one basic weakness of Lange’s approach is that it completely
omits the market for capital, that is, the allocation of resources to
the future. Yet it does introduce accountability and a focus on results.
Lange’s socialist competition underlies all proposals for liberalization
in the Soviet bloc, such as the abortive economic reforms of the Czechs
in 1967 and 1968 which provoked Russian military invasion.*</p>
<p>The Russian opposition to the attempts at socialist competition was,
of course, not based on arguments of economic rationality and economic
performance. It was based on the perfectly valid argument that making
business management autonomous will weaken, perhaps fatally, the total
political control of the Communist party. Lange, as all economists
should do, put performance before power. The rulers of a police state
always put power before performance.</p>
<p>Lange’s ideas were being converted into reality in Yugoslavia in the
late sixties. There major businesses, while nominally owned by the
government, are managed autonomously and have to prove themselves in a
market in which there is a good deal of competition. Yugoslav businesses
are no longer financed directly by allocation on the basis of a national
plan. Instead they have to compete for capital on the basis of the
expected return on the investment, that is, on a “capitalist” and
profit-making basis.</p>
<p>All attempts in the Soviet Union to inject performance into the
economy are essentially attempts to introduce Lange’s socialist
competition, that is, managerial autonomy and accountability based on
market performance and market result (though both Lange’s name and the
term “socialist competition” are still verboten). There is little
resistance anymore to the argument of the reformers that socialist
competition would yield vastly superior economic results; the resistance
is to the risk of losing political control.</p>
<p>In other words, the debate over the market and the morality of
private ownership for profit is largely becoming irrelevant. The debate
should be conducted over the performance capacity of a system under
which business is being paid for results and performance as against a
system in which it is being financed out of budget allocations. On that
score there is essentially no debate. Wherever a market test is truly
possible, it will result in performance and results—not because of the
greater “virtue” of free enterprise or of autonomous managers but
because being paid for performance and results directs toward
performance and results.</p>
<p>The Limits of the Market</p>
<p>But it is equally clear that the market is not capable of organizing
all institutions.</p>
<p>Service institutions are a most diverse lot. They include natural
monopolies, which are obviously economic institutions—the telephone
service, the postal service, but also the electricity supply in a given
area. Service institutions also include the administration of justice
and defense, which, equally obviously, are not and should not be
economic institutions. The one and only thing they all have in common is
that, for one reason or another, they cannot be organized under a
competitive market test.†</p>
<p>*On this see Ota Sik, Czechoslovakia: The Bureaucratic Economy
(International Arts and Sciences Press, 1972); Sik was the economic
architect of the Czech reforms until ousted by the Russians.</p>
<p>†This may no longer be necessarily true for the postal service; at
least an independent postal company in the U.S. is trying to organize a
business in competition to the government’s postal monopoly. Should this
work out,</p>
<p>The Limits of Public Policy</p>
<p>The traditional conclusion of capitalists and socialists alike has
been that where the market cannot provide a performance test, “public
policy” will provide guidance and control; but, as our discussion of the
impact of the budget basis shows, this is not an adequate answer. To be
sure, service institutions, including those within a business, must be
controlled by policy. But they need more than programs, promises, good
intentions, and hard work, the whole underwritten by a budget. They need
a system and structure that directs them toward performance—wherever
possible. As our examples show, service institutions also need the
discipline of planned obsolescence and planned abandonment of their
policies. In every one of our cases, effectiveness was obtained for a
time—but not forever.</p>
<p>Vail’s solution worked for a half century—but, as said earlier, it is
by no means sure that it works any longer. The American university has
outgrown the structure its founders built a century ago. It needs now
new thinking about its mission and function, its objective and
governance, its priorities and the criteria by which it should measure
its accomplishments and results. The TVA has performed so well as to
make itself irrelevant. What it pioneered forty years ago is now
commonplace; no one any longer expects salvation by electrification.</p>
<p>Japan ultimately became a prisoner of the success of Meiji. The men
of Meiji were very conscious that they had chosen priorities and had
postponed or subordinated important areas. Their successors refused to
consider any other priorities. As a result, military strength, which to
the men of Meiji was a means to the end of Japanese independence, became
an end in itself and ultimately brought catastrophe on Japan, almost
wrecking the great achievement of the Meiji generation.</p>
<p>it would do more to restore performance to the mails than setting up
a postal monopoly as a separate “public corporation” that is on a
“businesslike” basis.</p>

Service Institutions for Performance</h4>
<p>Principles of Effectiveness in Service Institutions—How to Apply the
Principles—The Three Kinds of Service Institutions and Their Specific
Needs—Auditing Objectives and Activities for Organized
Abandonment—Managing Service Institutions for Performance</p>
<p>Different classes of service institutions need different structures.
But all of them, we may conclude, need first to impose on themselves
such discipline as did the managers and leaders of the institutions in
the examples in Chapter 13.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>They need to define “what is our business and what should it be.”
They need to bring alternatives of definition into the open, and to
think them through carefully, perhaps even to work out (as did the
presidents of the emerging American universities) the balance of
different and perhaps even conflicting definitions of “what our business
is and what it should be.”</p></li>
<li><p>They need to derive clear objectives and goals from their
definition of function and mission.</p></li>
<li><p>They then have to think through priorities of concentration which
enable them to select targets, to set standards of accomplishment and
performance, that is, to define the minimum acceptable results; to set
deadlines; to go to work on results, and to make someone accountable for
results.</p></li>
<li><p>They need to define measurements of performance—the
customer-satisfaction measurements of the Telephone Company, or the
literacy figures by which the men of Meiji measured their
progress.</p></li>
<li><p>They need to use these measurements to feed back on their
efforts, that is, to build self-control from results into their
system.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, they need an organized audit of objectives and results,
so as to identify those objectives that no longer serve a purpose or
have proven unattainable. They need to identify unsatisfactory
performance, and activities which are obsolete or unproductive, or both.
And, they need a mechanism for sloughing off such activities rather than
wasting their money and their energies where the results are
unsatisfactory.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The last requirement may be the most important one. The absence of a
market test removes from the service institution the discipline that
forces a business eventually to abandon yesterday—or else go bankrupt.
Assessing and abandoning low-performance activities in service
institutions, outside and inside business, would be the most painful but
also the most salutary innovation.</p>
<p>To test objectives and their appropriateness, priorities, and, above
all, results against expectations, is perhaps needed most for
yesterday’s successes.</p>
<p>No success, as our examples show, is “forever.” Yet it is far more
difficult to abandon yesterday’s success than it is to reappraise
failure. Success breeds its own hubris. It creates emotional attachment,
habits of mind and action, and, above all, false selfconfidence. A
success that has outlived its usefulness may, in the end, be more
damaging than failure.</p>
<p>In a service institution particularly, yesterday’s success becomes
“policy,” “virtue,”</p>
<p>“conviction,” if not holy writ, unless the institution imposes on
itself the discipline of thinking through its mission, its objectives,
and its priorities, and of building in feedback control from results and
performance on policies, priorities, and action. We are in such a
“welfare mess” today in the United States, largely because the welfare
program of the New Deal had been such a success in the thirties that we
could not abandon it and, instead, misapplied it to the radically
different problem of the Black immigrants in the cities in the fifties
and sixties.</p>
<p>To make service institutions perform, it should by now be clear, does
not require great men. It requires instead a system. The essentials of
this system are not too different from the essentials of performance in
a business enterprise, but the application will be quite different. The
service institutions are not businesses; performance means something
quite different in them.</p>
<p>The applications of the essentials will and should differ greatly for
different service institutions. As our examples showed—and were meant to
show—there are at least three different kinds of service
institutions—institutions that are not paid for performance and results,
but for efforts and programs.</p>
<p>The Three Kinds of Service Institutions</p>
<ol start="12" type="a">
<li>There is first the natural monopoly. It does produce economic goods
and services, or at least it is supposed to; yet it cannot be paid for
out of results and performance precisely because it is a monopoly.</li>
</ol>
<p>The economist defines as natural monopoly those businesses which have
to have exclusive rights in a given area—the telephone service or the
electric power service. But the research laboratory within a business is
also a natural monopoly within its business.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The next group of service institutions are those that have to be
paid for out of a budget allocation. While they share a common
character, their individual purpose and the specific way in which they
try to accomplish it need not be uniform; and the priorities can—and
indeed often should—be quite diverse.</li>
</ol>
<p>The American university is one example. Each of the six university
presidents in our case history was concern with higher education. Each
was out to build a university on the ruins of the old, decayed
eighteenth-century denominational academy. They all saw alternative
missions and functions. Each tried to structure his university so as to
give different emphasis among these alternatives of “what our business
is or should be,” and each set different priorities. They knowingly and
deliberately, built competing institutions though all were universities
and had the same structure: trustees, an administration, faculty and
students, and similar courses leading to the same degrees.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Finally, there are those service institutions in which means are as
important as ends, and in which, therefore, uniformity is of the
essence. Here belongs the administration of justice or defense and most
of the areas which, in traditional political philosophy, were considered
policy areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Institutions’ Specific Needs</p>
<p>What does each of these institutions need?</p>
<p>The natural monopoly needs the least structure. It is closest to
results even though not directly being paid for them. All it needs, in
other words, is to do what any business should be doing anyhow, but to
do it far more systematically.</p>
<p>This, incidentally, is a strong argument in favor of keeping natural
monopolies under public regulation rather than under public ownership.
An unregulated natural monopoly,</p>
<p>as economists and political scientists learned long ago, will
inevitably exploit, in addition to being ineffective and inefficient. A
government-owned monopoly may not exploit, but the customer has no
redress against inefficiency, poor service, high rates, and general
disregard of his needs. An independently managed monopoly under public
regulation is likely to be far more responsive to customer
dissatisfactions and consumer needs than either the unregulated private
or the government-owned monopoly. The regulated but independently
managed monopoly depends on public opinion, expressed to and through a
political agency, the regulatory body, for its rates and, therefore, for
its revenues and profits.</p>
<p>The French telephone customer knows perfectly well that he gets the
worst telephone service in any developed country (excepting only the
Soviet Union). Because telephone service is a government-owned monopoly,
he has no power and can only grumble. In the late sixties, the operating
efficiency of the American telephone system declined in some areas,
notably New York City, and waiting periods for service or for repair
became longer (a result, largely, of inattention to demographics in the
Telephone Company’s plans); customers could and did take effective
action. They began immediately to oppose requests from the telephone
company for rate increases—and a more effective means of disciplining a
monopoly is hard to imagine.</p>
<p>The American customers, however, are like the French in respect to
the postal service, where rates have been rising steeply for forty
years, and services have been deteriorating even faster. Since the
postal service is government-owned, we have no redress.</p>
<p>In addition, the regulatory agency through which a government body
deals with a private company on an arm’s-length basis can provide the
means for building into the structure of regulated monopolies the
systematic performance of the job Theodore Vail built in sixty years ago
for the American Telephone Company. Both the Federal Communications
Commission in its study of the long-lines (that is, long-distance)
service of the Bell System and the Federal Power Commission in its study
of electric-power supply in the midAtlantic states have moved toward
demanding such self-discipline from the various companies.</p>
<p>With respect to the monopoly which the research laboratory represents
within a business, top management can and should demand the discipline
of thinking through objectives, setting goals and priorities, measuring
performance, and sloughing off the unproductive. This is the only way to
make the research laboratory productive, responsive to the company’s
needs, opportunities, and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Management should also demand that goals of contribution be spelled
out and results be appraised against them. This need not be
quantitative—indeed, it often cannot be quantified. Still, the goals
should be specific and the appraisal rigorous.</p>
<p>One of the most effective research managers—himself a scientist of
world renown— makes it his practice to ask, “What have you in this
research lab contributed to the company’s vision, knowledge, and results
during the last three to five years?” And then he asks, “And what do you
expect to contribute to the company’s vision, knowledge, and results
during the next five years?” He reports that he never gets an answer the
first time he asks the question. All he gets are speeches on the
“intangibility” of research and its beatitudes. After asking the
question for a few years more, he begins to get answers; and a few years
later he even gets research results.</p>
<p>“Socialist Competition” in the Service Sector</p>
<p>The second kind of service institution is exemplified by school and
university, and also by the hospital. Most of the service staffs within
business organizations belong here too. What they need is Lange’s
socialist competition.</p>
<p>The “customer” of this kind of service institution is not really a
customer; he is a tributary. He pays for the service institution whether
he wants to or not, out of taxes, levies such as compulsory insurance,
or overhead allocations. The products of these institutions are not
meant to supply a want. They are meant to supply a need. School and
hospi-</p>
<p>tal, but also the typical service staff in business, supply what
everybody should have, ought to have, must have, because it is “good for
him,” or good for society.</p>
<p>This kind of service institution is normative, to use the logician’s
term. It aims at making its “customers” be something, do something,
behave in a certain way, know certain things, or believe in certain
things. Most of the service institutions of this second kind also
provide a public good which could not be furnished—often not even at the
most prohibitive cost—except on a collective basis. Both because they
are normative and because they supply a public good, they can be
financed only out of taxes, overhead allocation, or other compulsory
levies.</p>
<p>The service institutions of this second kind are the typical service
institutions of a developed society and are its institutional hallmark.
Monopolies and institutions of government—the service institutions of
the first and third categories—dominate undeveloped societies. But the
service institution of the second category becomes central in the
process of economic and social development. Its performance is crucial
to modern developed society. And in developed societies—or developed
businesses—it is this service institution that most closely touches the
daily life of the citizen—or of the manager.</p>
<p>Our rhetoric talks of the “right of every child to an education.” The
young people, however, complain about the compulsion to go to
school—they are more nearly right than the traditional rhetoric. We talk
of the “right of every citizen to decent health care.” In the United
States this is still, in part, an unfulfilled promise. Yet we are
already well on the way toward compulsory health care. In many
companies, for instance, executives are required to have an annual
physical checkup or else they lose their vacation or are not paid.</p>
<p>If and when the focus shifts to preventive medicine for large numbers
of people, as is likely to happen within a fairly short period, we will
soon demand of everybody that he avail himself of healthcare facilities.
In other words, we will make health care compulsory.</p>
<p>Compulsory utilization of the service staff is prescribed in a good
many businesses.</p>
<p>The marketing managers in the divisions of a decentralized company
are not asked, as a rule, whether they want to attend the marketing
seminars put on by the central marketing staff. They are told to
come.</p>
<p>The objective—the overall mission—must be general for this kind of
service institution. There should be minimum standards of performance
and results. But for the sake of performance, it is highly desirable,
particularly for public-owned institutions, that they should have
managerial autonomy and not be run by government even if they are
supervised and regulated by it.* Also, there should be a fair amount of
consumer choice between different ways of accomplishing the basic
mission, between different priorities and different methods. There
should be enough competition for these institutions to hold themselves
to performance standards.</p>
<p>We talk today in the U.S. about a voucher system for elementary and
high school education under which the government would pay to whatever
accredited school the child attends an amount equal to the cost of
teaching a child in the public schools. No matter how much latitude
schools would be given under such a voucher plan, surely none will,
however, be considered qualified under it unless it promises to give its
pupils a modicum of proficiency in basic skills such as reading,
writing, and figuring. We may leave it up to the school what method it
uses—there is room for experimentation, from the strictest traditional
school discipline to the behavioral manipulation of the English “open
school” or to “free-form” methods of education. But, fundamental goals
and minimum standards will, and should be, insisted upon. Similarly,
schools teaching, say, urban guerrilla warfare in Black neighborhoods
are unlikely to stay long on the approved list—and should</p>
<p>*In an earlier book, The Age of Discontinuity, I called this
“re-privatization” for want of a better term. This, however, has been
widely misunderstood as meaning return to private ownership, which is
not at all what I had in mind (though I would not exclude it either).
What is important is the autonomy of the institution, its subjection to
performance tests and to some form of competition, albeit in many cases
“socialist competition.”</p>
<p>not. And there will be no choice as to whether a child of school age
goes to school or not—he goes, whether he and his parents like it or
not.</p>
<p>In health care, too, we may well move to a system that establishes
the principle that everyone is entitled to prepaid health care—paid for
either out of employees’ insurance or by government for the aged and the
poor. Yet we may well encourage considerable differentiation among
different plans, and considerable competition between different kinds of
health-care institutions with different plans and different priorities.
This is the approach of the oldest national health-care plan, that of
Germany.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the application of the same approach to the
service staff in a major business. One large multinational company,
primarily producing and selling branded consumer goods, defines its
business as “marketing.” With such a definition one would expect to find
a large marketing services staff in the company. But the staff is
remarkably small. There is a marketing vice-president in top
management—he is, in effect, the number two man in the company. But
marketing services do not report to him but to a director of marketing
services. The marketing services staff has a small budget that pays for
such activities as training the marketing services personnel, research
in the marketing field, the library, and so on, but not for marketing
services to the company’s businesses. Every one of the forty-five to
fifty decentralized and autonomously managed businesses of the company
located in more than thirty countries is held responsible for its
marketing performance and marketing results. To help his business reach
these results, the loca1 general manager may use the marketing services
staff but is under no compulsion to do so. He is entitled to use outside
consultants of his choice, or, if he so desires, he need not use any
marketing staff but be his own marketing consultant. Only if he does use
the marketing services staff does he pay for marketing services. The
marketing staff, however, audits the marketing standards and marketing
performance of every unit. When last heard of, eighteen or twenty of the
divisional and territorial managers of the company used the marketing
services staff. Eleven or twelve used outside consultants. Another dozen
did not use any service staff, whether inside or outside the company.
The marketing results of these men show no correlation to their methods.
Among the best and among the poorest performers are divisions which use
the company’s marketing staff, divisions which use outside consultants,
and divisions which do not use any marketing staff at all. Even the poor
performers in this company have remarkably high standards and good
marketing results. And the marketing services staff is among the best I
know, in its effectiveness, in its performance, and in its spirit and
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The Institutions of Governance</p>
<p>The third category of service institutions is, by and large, the
traditional government activities—the administration of justice and
defense and all the activities concerned with policy-making as the term
used to be understood. These institutions do not provide public goods in
the economist’s sense of the term; they provide governance.</p>
<p>Here managerial autonomy is not possible. Competition, if possible at
all, would be most undesirable. These institutions have to be under
direct government control and directly government-operated, yet their
activities require the discipline of objectives, priorities, and
measurement of results.</p>
<p>Such institutions require, therefore, an organized, independent audit
of their promises, the assumptions on which they base themselves, and
their performance. There is no way of building any feedback from results
into these institutions. The only disciplines, therefore, to which they
can be subjected are analysis and audit. The institution of the
auditorgeneral became accepted in government during the nineteenth
century (though it goes back to the France of Louis XIV, that is, the
late seventeenth century, and was established pretty much in its present
form as early as 1760 or so by Frederick the Great in Prussia). By now
it is commonplace for government to establish a separate agency,
independent of executive and legislative branches, which audits
expenditures and exposes to public notice dishonesty, irregularity, and
gross inefficiency.</p>
<p>Now that service institutions have become so central, so important,
and so costly; we need an auditor-general of objectives and performance.
We need to force ourselves to look at proposed government policies,
laws, and programs—but also at the policies, programs, and activities of
service staffs—and ask, “Are the objectives realistic? Are they
attainable or pure rhetoric? Do they relate appropriately to the needs
they are supposed to satisfy? Have the right targets been set? Have
priorities been thought through? And, do results relate to promises and
expectations?”</p>
<p>The American government may have begun to realize the need. This
explains the recent change of name from Bureau of the Budget to Office
of Management and Budget. But this new organ is still an agency of the
president and located in his executive office. To produce results it
will have to be independent. It will also need the right and the duty to
monitor proposed legislation, that is, audit the legislature, as it is
now supposed to monitor the execution of programs that have already been
adopted. So far the office of Management and Budget is mostly promise,
but at least it has now been recognized that making the service
institutions of the federal government perform requires organized review
of objectives and performance and organized abandonment of
yesterday.</p>
<p>We need to go further and accept as a basic premise that every
governmental agency and every act of the legislature be conceived as
impermanent. A new activity, a new agency, a new program should be
enacted for a limited time, to be extended only when results prove the
soundness of the objective and of the means chosen. This may sound
utopian—and in government it may still be. Outside of government, in
other service institutions—including those that should be autonomous
even though public (e.g., school or hospital)—this will have to come to
pass. Society is becoming too dissatisfied with the lack of performance
and results of service institutions to tolerate the traditional system
forever.</p>
<p>Failure to abolish nonperforming programs accounts for many of our
worst problems.</p>
<p>It underlies the failure of the U.S. and the Common Market farm
programs; it underlies the “welfare mess” that threatens to destroy our
cities; it underlies the failure of our international development
programs which threatens to bring about worldwide race war of poor
nonwhites against rich whites.</p>
<p>Failure to feed back from results may well, tomorrow, endanger the
environment and our efforts to save it. Results are badly needed. But so
far we have neither faced up to the need to think through what we are
after nor set priorities; nor have we organized a feedback from results
on the direction, the priorities, and the efforts of the environmental
crusade. Predictably, this can only mean no results, and rapid
disenchantment.</p>
<p>What the service institutions need is not to be more businesslike.
They need to be subjected to performance tests—if only to that of
“socialist competition”—as much as possible. But they need to be more
hospital-like, university-like, government-like, and so on. In other
words, they need to think through their own specific functions,
purposes, and missions.</p>
<p>What the service institutions need is not better people. They need
people who do the management job systematically and who focus themselves
and their institution purposefully on performance and results. They do
need efficiency, that is, control of costs, but above all they need
effectiveness, that is, emphasis on the right results.</p>
<p>Few service institutions today suffer from having too few
administrators; most of them are over-administered, and suffer from a
surplus of procedures, organization charts, and management techniques.
What now has to be learned is to manage service institutions for
performance. This may well be the biggest and most important management
task in this century.</p>
<h4 id="the-new-realities">15 The New Realities</h4>
<p>Work and Its Ambivalence— “Work” and “Working” —Work and Worker in
Rapid Change—The “Employee Society” —The Shift to the Knowledge
Worker—The Crisis of the Manual Worker— “Hard Hats” versus “Liberals”
—The Crisis of the Labor Union—Managing the Knowledge Worker; the New
Challenge—What Is Productivity in Knowledge Work? —And What Is
Achievement? —The Segmentation of the Work Force—The Fallacy of the “One
Personnel Policy” —The “New Breed”</p>
<p>F</p>
<p>EW WORDS IN THE LANGUAGE are as ambivalent as “work,” and as
emotionladen. There are “work and rest”; and “rest” is clearly “good.”
But whether “retire ment” is better than “work” is already questionable.
There is no doubt that work is preferable to “idleness.” And being “out
of work” is far from “good”—is, indeed, a catastrophe.</p>
<p>There are “work and play.” “Play” carries a favorable connotation.
But “playing at being a surgeon” is not good at all. Work can be high
achievement, as in the phrase “an artist’s life work.” Or it can be
sheer drudgery, backbreaking, and utter boredom.</p>
<p>Language thus makes it abundantly clear that work is complex and that
it is embedded in man’s life, in his emotions, in his existence in
society and community, and in his relationship to himself.</p>
<p>Work is both noun and verb. There are “work” and “working.” They are
totally dependent on each other. Unless someone is working, no work gets
done. But unless there is work, there is also no working.</p>
<p>Yet work and working are quite different. Work is impersonal, and
objective. It is a “something.” Not all work can be weighed or measured.
Even the most intangible piece of work is outside the worker and
independent of him.</p>
<p>What distinguishes work from play is an old question that has never
been answered satisfactorily. The activity itself is often the same,
down to the smallest detail. Yet psychologically and socially, the two
are quite different. The true distinction may well be that work, unlike
play, is impersonal and objective. Work has a result that is outside of
the worker. The purpose of play lies in the player; the purpose of work
lies with the user of the end product. Where the end product is not
determined by the player but by others, we do not speak of play, we
speak of work. We say that someone is playing chess—but we say also that
someone is working on a chess problem.</p>
<p>Even the work of the artist is impersonal and a “thing.” To have
artistic validity, a work of art must indeed be an extension of the
artist’s personality. Otherwise it is sterile, academic, without power
to move. But even the most subjective painter, when looking at a picture
he has just finished, will not ask, “Is this me?” He will ask, “Is it
right?” And, as has often been remarked, no listener could possibly
guess at the turmoil and despair in which Beethoven lived when he wrote
his most joyful and happiest symphony, the Seventh. Indeed, knowing the
conditions under which the work was produced adds nothing to the
listener’s enjoyment, to his appreciation of the music, or to its power
to move.</p>
<p>But working is done by a human being, a worker. It is a uniquely
human activity.</p>
<p>Working, therefore, is physiology and psychology, society and
community, personality, economics, and power. As the old human relations
tag has it, “One cannot hire a hand; the whole man always comes with
it.”</p>
<p>Work and working, therefore, follow different rules. Work belongs to
the realm of objects. It has its own impersonal logic. But working
belongs to the realm of man. It has dynamics. Yet the manager always has
to manage both work and working. He has to make work productive and the
worker achieving. He has to integrate work and worker.</p>
<p>Both work and worker are in a period of rapid change. The changes
that will dominate the rest of this century—and probably most of the
next century as well—are the most radical changes since the beginning of
the industrial revolution more than two hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Most of the working population, certainly in the developed countries,
now work as employees. They work in organizations rather than by
themselves. They work outside of and away from their families. Society
has become an employee society. Only a century ago the great majority of
people—especially, of course, farmers—worked either by themselves or in
very small groups. Work still centered around the home.</p>
<p>At the same time the center of gravity of the work force is shifting
from the manual worker to the knowledge worker. A larger and larger
proportion of the labor force in all developed countries does not work
with its hands, whether as skilled or as unskilled workers, but with
ideas, concepts, theories. In the Marxist—or Russian—usage of the term,
they are “intelligentsia.” Their output is not a physical object, but
knowledge and ideas. Again, only half a century ago, knowledge work was
primarily performed by independent professionals working either alone or
in very small groups. The bulk of the labor force was manual
workers.</p>
<p>Knowledge work need not be highly skilled or highly schooled. Filing,
after all, requires neither high mental capacity nor advanced schooling.
But the tool of the file clerk is not hammer or sickle, but the
alphabet, that is, a high-level abstraction and a symbol rather than a
thing. One does not learn the alphabet through experience but through
formal education.</p>
<p>The Crisis of the Manual Worker</p>
<p>These changes mean, first, a crisis with respect to the manual worker
and to his specific organization, the labor union.</p>
<p>For two hundred years the manual worker in industry, the child of the
Industrial Revolution, has been struggling to gain economic security,
status, and power in industrial society. During the last fifty years,
since the end of World War I, his progress was dazzling. In most
developed countries the manual worker, only yesterday a “proletarian”
scratching a bare living at the margin of subsistence, has acquired
substantial economic security, an income level higher than that of the
well-to-do middle class of yesterday, and increasing political
power.</p>
<p>With the rise of the knowledge worker, he is endangered again. His
economic security is not threatened—on the contrary, it is likely to
become even more firmly established. But his social position and status
are rapidly diminishing. In the developed countries, the industrial
worker sees himself severely deprived. He is defeated, a loser, before
he even starts—especially the younger one. This is not a result of
managerial actions, but of social developments and of the pressures they
generate.</p>
<p>Increasingly in all developed societies the able, intelligent, and
ambitious members of the working class stay in school beyond the point
at which they are eligible for manual work. All the pressures of
society, family and neighbors, community and school, push the youngster
toward more schooling. The one who leaves school at the age at which he
once would have graduated into the manual work force—fifteen or so—is a
dropout, a failure, a reject.</p>
<p>The young manual worker of today therefore starts out with a feeling
of rejection, a feeling of failure, a conviction of being a second-class
citizen. In most developed countries (Britain and France are perhaps the
only exceptions so far, though things are changing there rapidly too)
close members of his own family, a brother, a sister, or a cousin, stay
on in school and graduate into knowledge work and into a superior social
class. Indeed, the young blue-collar workers themselves tend to be
highly schooled, at least in the U.S. Most of them have finished
secondary school; and more than half have gone on to some kind of
college at least for a year—and then dropped out. But this only adds to
the sense of defeat and rejection for the younger manual worker.
Seventy-five or one hundred years ago there was a self-respecting
working class, that is, a working class that knew itself to be the equal
of its “betters,’’ except in income and economic position.</p>
<p>But the manual worker of today in the developed countries does not
respect himself.</p>
<p>This inevitably makes him bitter, suspicious, distrustful of himself
as well as of organization and management, and resentful. He is not a
revolutionary, as his parents and grandparents were. For it is obvious
to him that revolution cannot alter the fundamental conditions—apart
from the fact that, in sharp contrast to the Marxian prophecy of fifty
years ago, knowledge workers are rapidly becoming the majority instead
of the proletarians. But the manual worker of today is a militant and
likely to become more militant as the center of social gravity keeps on
shifting toward knowledge work and knowledge worker.</p>
<p>The rhetoric of workers’ parties and movements still talks of the
wicked capitalists and lambasts the profit system. But the true class
war is increasingly being fought between the hard hats—manual
workers—and the liberals—the employed, middle-class knowledge workers.
It was their coalition everywhere—in America’s New Deal as well as in
the social democratic and labor parties of Europe (beginning with the
“Lib-Lab” coalition that put into power the first “modern” government,
Lloyd George’s 1907 cabinet in Britain—which created the progressive
Left and dominated politics in all developed countries during most of
this century so far. The major political event for the remainder of this
century may well be a growing split between these two groups.</p>
<p>In the U.S.—and to a lesser extent in Great Britain and Western
Europe—the years since World War II have brought a massive shift in
opportunities, power, and status from the worker to the middle-class
professional, that is, to teachers, social workers, and administrators
of government programs. The relative shares of national income from
wages and salaries and from income on property changed little in these
years, nor did the income distribution between high and low incomes
change much. But the middle group gained greatly, especially relative to
workers. Whatever the social programs of the last twentyfive years in
the developed countries were meant to achieve, they all had as their
first— and often as their main—result a growth in numbers, income, and
power of the employed, middle-class knowledge worker.</p>
<p>Considerable doubt has been cast on the old assumption that higher
school expenditures per child necessarily mean better education and
better schools. But they certainly mean higher incomes for more
teachers. Whether the programs of America’s war on poverty helped many
of, the poor is questionable, but they created untold well-paying jobs
for social workers, accountants, and administrators. While the
environment may, one hopes, benefit more from the environmental crusade
than the poor did from the war on poverty, the first beneficiaries are,
of course, biologists, engineers, chemists, and so on. All these
programs are paid for out of taxes on the middle-income groups—there is
no other large tax base in a developed country; and “middle-income
group” is the economist’s euphemism for “workers,” who, inescapably, pay
the cost for most of these programs that directly benefit better paid
and more educated “knowledge people.” That these exactions are levied in
the name of progress and for liberal or “left-wing” causes adds insult
to the injury—at least in the eyes of the hard hat.</p>
<p>The Crisis of the Labor Union</p>
<p>The changes in the status of the manual worker that attend the shift
in emphasis to knowledge work and knowledge worker not only create a new
class cleavage—more divisive, potentially, than the one that set
proletarian against bourgeoisie in the opening decades of the nineteenth
century—but also create severe difficulties for the manual worker’s own
institution, the labor union. Perhaps the most visible sign of this is
the sharp drop in the quality of trade-union leadership—in large measure
as a result of the “educational explosion.” Labor-union, leadership was
the career opportunity for the able and ambitious young worker of
yesterday whom lack of means forced out of school early and thus
deprived of the opportunity to move out of the working class into the
middle class, if not into the ranks of the bosses.</p>
<p>The late Walter Reuther of the United Automobile Workers’ Union for
twenty-five years was the best known, the most respected, and perhaps
the most powerful American labor leader. Reuther started, in the 1920s,
to go to college. If he had been able to stay on and to get his degree,
he might well have been, twenty years later, one of the top men in the
automobile industry. He had drive, ambition, intelligence, and an
intuitive grasp of economic and business problems. He was a skillful
organization politician who knew how to build an internal political
machine. But he was also a loyal organization man. That he started out
with deep socialist convictions might have made little difference. After
all, Henry Ford was widely considered at one time to be an “anarchist.”
Many of the men who ran the automobile industry in the forties and early
fifties—including Charles Wilson, who succeeded Alfred P. Sloan as chief
executive at GM—had the same background and, like Reuther, grew up in
working-class homes, in which Eugene Debs, the American socialist leader
of pre-World War I days, was the chief deity.</p>
<p>But when the early Depression years forced Reuther to drop out of
college, he became instead a machinist on the assembly line. From then
on all the energies of an able and ambitious man were channeled into the
one career opportunity available to him, union leadership.</p>
<p>In the developed countries today the able and ambitious youngster
stays in school— and may go on to a graduate degree. As a result, he
moves into the professional and managerial ranks. His convictions may
still be “left.” But his leadership qualities are lost to the working
class. The leaders who are moving into the vacuum this creates are
likely to be men driven by resentment rather than by ambition, of far
lower ability, and above all, men without self-confidence. They are weak
leaders—and the worst situation for an industry to be in is to have to
deal with weak union leadership.</p>
<p>At the same time, the fact that the young worker sees himself a
“loser” makes him resist and resent the very union leaders he selects
and puts into office. The moment a man holds an important leadership
position in the trade union, he automatically becomes “establishment.”
He has to consort with the mighty, whether in government or in business.
He has to exercise power. He has to have the trappings of power—the big
office, the retinue of aides and assistants, the four telephones on the
desk, and so on. In order to be effective, he has to become one of
“them” and ceases to be one of “us.” Yesterday’s worker looked upon
union power as representing him. He was proud of the fact that the union
leader had become a person of authority. Today’s young worker, feeling
keenly that he is a loser and a reject, resists, understandably, the
union leader’s authority even more than he resists the rest of the
bosses. As a result, union leaders are increasingly losing control over
their own members, are repudiated by them, resisted by them, disavowed
by them. This, in turn, makes the union increasingly weak. For a union
is impotent if it cannot deliver the union member’s vote and behavior,
cannot guarantee observance of a contract agreement, and cannot count on
the members’ support for the leader’s position and actions.</p>
<p>The future of the trade union and its role in industrial society,
especially in developed countries, is beyond the scope of this book.
There is very little doubt that collective bargaining, whether between
an individual company and a trade union, or—as in Western</p>
<p>Europe and Japan—between an industry and an industry-wide union, is
in trouble. Whether the “civilized industrial warfare” of collective
bargaining—a major achievement of the early years of the twentieth
century—can even survive is questionable. What could take its place is
altogether obscure.</p>
<p>All attempts to replace collective bargaining by some other
arrangement, such as the Swedish and Dutch approaches to tripartite
settlements worked out in the national interest by representatives of
public, management, and labor together, have been short-lived. They work
in an emergency—such as the period in which Holland rebuilt its economy
after World War II. But they have proven unable to survive major
pressures, such as inflation. They are increasingly rejected by the new
breed of workers.</p>
<p>No economy—and indeed, no society—can tolerate either unbridled
industrial warfare, and especially unbridled industrial guerrilla
warfare, or the constant escalation of labor costs and constant heavy
inflation. Government control is no answer either. Wageprice policies
have so far worked fitfully at best and for limited periods only.</p>
<p>But an organ for the representation of the worker against management,
or at least to management, is needed—by the workers, but also by
society.*</p>
<p>Management, no matter how selected or constituted, is, and has to be,
a power. Any power needs restraint and control—or else it becomes
tyranny. The union is a very peculiar, an almost unprecedented, organ of
restraint on the political power of management. It is an opposition
which can never become the government. Yet within its limited scope it
serves an essential function in industrial society. But it is
increasingly becoming incapable of discharging this function.</p>
<p>The opposition function of the labor union will be needed more in the
future than ever in the past. The manual worker is beginning to feel
rightly—that he can no longer depend on a political party and its appeal
to a majority. That is the consequence of the gradual dissolution of the
New Deal, Labor, or social democratic marriage between worker and
liberal. Increasingly, also, the power which needs restraining is not
that of the bosses or the capitalists but of the educated middle class
of knowledge workers. They are not greatly interested in profits, but
all the more in power. The most bitter power conflicts are not those
that erupt in private enterprise or in business; they are conflicts
between janitors and school boards, medical orderlies and hospital
administrators, teaching assistants and graduate faculties, or, as in
the Swedish steel industry, between workers and their staunchly
socialist bosses in a nationalized industry. They are conflicts between
workers and the public interest (at least as defined by the liberals).
In such conflicts political parties which aim at mass support and at
attracting a majority of the voters are almost bound to be on the side
of the bosses, if only because no amount of rhetoric can conceal that
the price for a settlement will not be paid out of profits but surely
out of prices or taxes.</p>
<p>Public-service institutions may face a much more difficult industrial
relations problem than business and are much less prepared for it.
Hospitals, schools, government agencies, and so on have all become
increasingly unionized. In these institutions the manual worker—or the
lower ranking clerical worker—feels even more “dispossessed,” and even
more confined to second-class citizenship than the manua1 worker does in
manufacturing or service industries.</p>
<p>The unions themselves are incapable of thinking through their own
future role and developing new approaches to their own structure and
function. One reason is that the new leaders who replace the dying or
retiring pioneers are so often men of lesser ability, lesser maturity,
and lesser competence. But as important is the fact that the new leaders
can keep their slender grip on the membership only by being “against”
everything. The new leaders dare not even ask questions, let alone come
up with answers. They dare not lead but are forced to make violent
motions to stay in place. The pitiful failure of the British trade
unions to tackle the problems of union reform to which every new General
Secretary of the Trades Union Congress commits himself in ringing tones
when he assumes office is one example of many.</p>
<p>*On this see my book, The New Society (New York and London,
1950).</p>
<p>The politician too is unlikely to ask these, questions, let alone
answer them. He is paralyzed by the split between workers and liberals.
If he himself is a liberal, he is caught in the crossfire between the
two constituencies whose support he needs to get elected and to stay in
office. If he is not a liberal, he must increasingly be attracted by the
hope to gain for himself the support of one of the embittered partners
in the former marriage. Every conservative leader of recent years—Nixon
in the U.S., Heath in England, De Gaulle and Pompidou in France—has,
therefore, ducked the issue fully as much as the liberals. They can,
under pressures of a public opinion that is increasingly tired of
industrial warfare and especially of strikes “against the public
interest” (or, more bitterly resented, “against public convenience),
clamp down on union power. They may even within the foreseeable future
be pushed into action against monopolies—with respect to craft
jurisdiction and restraint of access to a trade, for instance. But they
are highly unlikely to be willing or able to tackle new basic
policy.</p>
<p>We need new policy in industrial relations. In all developed
countries—but in developing ones as well—managers in business and in
public-service institutions will, therefore, have to think through the
future of the union, its role, its function, and its position, both
within the institution and in society. This is a major social
responsibility of management. But it is also a business responsibility
of management. The future of business and of the economy, as well as
that of society, will be influenced greatly by the way we solve or fail
to solve the growing and deepening crisis of the labor unions. To think
through the role and function of the labor union is also self-interest
for management. To believe that labor-union weakness means management
strength is sheer self-delusion. One may deplore unionization (I myself
have rarely been considered pro-union by anyone in the labor movement).
But once there is a union—and unionization is a fact in all developed
noncommunist countries—a weak union, that is, one without established
role, function, and authority and without strong, secure, and effective
leadership, means strife, demagoguery, irresponsible demands, and
increasing bitterness and tension. It does not mean management strength;
it means management frustration.</p>
<p>Managing the Knowledge Worker; the New Challenge</p>
<p>Managing the manual worker and labor-union relations, while crucial
to society, are essentially rearguard actions for the manager. All he
can hope to do is to contain damage which two hundred years of
industrial history have left behind. Even this limited objective will
require very drastic changes in policies and practices. It will
certainly require even more drastic changes in managerial assumptions
and managerial attitudes. But the aim will have to be fairly modest. Not
to lose ground will be difficult enough—whether in productivity, in
motivation, or in relationships. To regain ground lost in two hundred
years of what can only be called industrial mismanagement is badly
needed, but it must today be considered a hope rather than a rational
expectation.</p>
<p>Managing knowledge work and knowledge worker is “today and tomorrow”
rather than “yesterday.” Because it is essentially a new task, we know
even less about it than we know about the management (or mismanagement)
of the manual worker. It is, therefore, going to be the more difficult
task. But there is no long legacy of bitterness, of mutual suspicion, of
resentment masquerading as scientific theories, and of folklore that has
set into the hard concrete of restrictions, rules, and regulations.
Managing knowledge work and knowledge worker therefore can focus on
developing the right policies and practices. It can focus on the future
rather than on undoing the past, on the opportunities rather than on
“problems.’’</p>
<p>Managing knowledge work and knowledge worker will require exceptional
imagination, exceptional courage, and leadership of a high order. In
some ways it will be a far more demanding task than managing the manual
worker was until very recently. For the weapon of fear—fear of economic
suffering, fear of job security, physical fear of company guards or of
the state’s police power—which for so long substituted for managing
manual work and the manual worker, is simply not operative at all in the
context of</p>
<p>knowledge work and knowledge worker. The knowledge worker, except on
the very lowest levels of knowledge work, is not productive under the
spur of fear; only selfmotivation and self-direction can make him
productive. He has to be achieving in order to produce at all.</p>
<p>The productivity, indeed the social cohesion, of every developed
society rests increasingly on the ability to make knowledge work
productive and the knowledge worker achieving. This may be the central
social problem of the new, the knowledge society. There are no
precedents for the management of knowledge work. Knowledge work
traditionally has been carried out by individuals working by themselves
in small groups.* Now knowledge work is carried out in large, complex,
managed institutions. The knowledge worker is not even the successor to
yesterday’s “knowledge professional.” He is the successor to yesterday’s
skilled worker. His status, his function, his contribution, his position
in the organization, therefore, still have to be defined.</p>
<p>Worse, we cannot truly define, let alone measure, productivity for
most knowledge work. One can define and measure it for the file clerk or
the salesgirl in the variety store. But productivity is already a murky
term with respect to the field salesman of a manufacturing business. Is
it total sales? Or is it the profit contribution from sales, which might
vary tremendously with the product mix individual salesmen might sell?
Or is it sales (or profit contribution) related to the potential of a
sales territory? Perhaps a salesman’s ability to hold old customers
should be considered central to his productivity. Or perhaps it should
be his ability to generate new accounts. These problems are far more
complex than the definition and measurement of the productivity of even
the highly skilled manual worker. There one can almost always define and
measure productivity in terms of the quantity of output—e.g., the number
of pairs of shoes produced per hour, per day, or per week above a
minimum quality standard.</p>
<p>Far more difficult even is a definition of productivity for the
design engineer or the service engineer; for the quality control man or
the sales forecaster; for the teacher (almost hopeless) or the research
scientist; finally, for the manager.</p>
<p>Achievement for the knowledge worker is even harder to define. No one
but the knowledge worker himself can come to grips with the question of
what in work, job performance, social status, and pride constitutes the
personal satisfaction that makes a knowledge worker feel that he
contributes, that he performs, that he serves his values, and that he
fulfills himself.</p>
<p>The Segmentation of the Work Force</p>
<p>Manual workers and knowledge workers are not the only work-force
segments, however. The clerical worker who is a production worker
without being a machine worker is probably a distinct and important
group. Equally important is the fact that the work force in all
developed countries is segmenting itself according to sex.</p>
<p>Till fairly recently, women employees were essentially either
temporary, working in the interlude between school and marriage, or
distinctly lower class. Wives of “respectable” workers did not accept
employment and work outside the home. Such upper-class women as worked
were largely independent professionals, e.g., the few women doctors,
women lawyers, and women university professors. The exceptions were
schoolteachers and hospital nurses; and they either stayed unmarried or
had to quit.</p>
<p>In all developed countries—the one exception so far being Japan—this
is changing drastically. It might well be the sign of a developed
country that a very large proportion of its women work as employees. The
married middle-class woman is increasingly becoming the typical woman
employee. With family size limited and with housework greatly
reduced—both because of simpler housekeeping and because of mechanical
appliances— more and more middleand upper-class women are joining the
work force. The trend is likely to continue. The driving forces are
economic, social, and psychological, rather than</p>
<p>*On this see my book, The Age of Discontinuity.</p>
<p>“women’s lib.” But the working woman requires a different job
structure appropriate to her realities and conditions. She requires
different treatment from the male worker with respect to job, economic
rewards, and social status in the plant community. Women with children,
for example, often need part-time work or flexible hours. And for
married women retirement pensions are often of little interest compared
with higher cash incomes.</p>
<p>Various segments of the work force also have different needs with
respect to benefits.</p>
<p>When it comes to cash wages they may all consider the same rewards
“value.” But when it comes to retirement pay, housing or educational
allowances, health and other benefits, their needs and expectations vary
greatly with sex, age, and family responsibilities, with the stage in
the life cycle and that of their families, and so on.</p>
<p>Traditionally an employer, whether a business or any other
institutions has had one personnel policy. In the future there will be
need for as many personnel policies as there are segments of the work
force. Increasingly the segmentation of the work force will require
differentiated approaches to the task of making work productive, and
especially to the task of making the worker achieving.</p>
<p>There are additional shifts: the shift from manual work to
automation, and the shift within manual work to high mechanization;
rapid changes in technology which make skills; whether manual or mental,
obsolescent within a few short years and, therefore, threaten
established crafts and established knowledges; the steady lengthening of
the human life span, which makes working life increasingly a preparation
for long years of nonwork, that is, of retirement; and many others.</p>
<p>But the three main challenges to managing work and worker are: (1)
the arrival of the employee society; (2) the changed psychological and
social position of the manual worker: better educated and better paid,
he still sees himself moving down from yesterday’s self-respecting
working class into second-class citizenship; and (3) the emergence of
knowledge work and the knowledge worker as the economic and social
center of what some people now call post-industrial society.</p>
<p>The New Breed</p>
<p>It is these changes that explain the arrival of the new breed of
workers, that is, the young people, and especially the highly educated
young people, who in the developed countries are challenging the
traditional management of work and workers, traditional organization,
and traditional economic and power relationships as well.</p>
<p>This is often attributed to affluence, as the result of which, we are
being told, the old Protestant ethic is crumbling.* This is far too glib
and superficial an explanation. To be sure, affluence is something new
under the sun. Throughout all of man’s history the great majority of
people has always lived at the margin of subsistence. The great majority
never knew where its next meal was going to come from. Now, in the
developed countries, the great majority is economically secure, at least
in traditional terms. But there is no sign that the great majority—or
any but the tiniest of minorities—has lost its appetite for economic
rewards, whether material or immaterial. On the contrary, the great
majority, now that they have tasted some of the fruits of productivity,
are clearly eager for more—much more than the economy can produce so
far, if not more than the limited resources of our planet could
produce.</p>
<p>The shift in the structure and character of work has created a demand
that work produce more than purely economic benefits. To make a living
is no longer enough. Work also has to make a life.</p>
<p>The rising level of expectations rather than affluence is the central
phenomenon. This means that it will be more important than ever to make
work productive. At the same time, both the manual worker with his deep
psychological insecurity and the knowledge worker with his new and
ill-defined status expect work to provide nonmaterial psycho-</p>
<p>*It does not seem to have occurred to Western sociologists that the
strongest practitioners of the Protestant ethic have for long periods of
time been such notorious non-Calvinists as the Japanese and the
Chinese.</p>
<p>logical and social satisfactions. They do not necessarily expect work
to be enjoyable but they expect it to be achieving.</p>

Change in the Process of Being Satisfied—What Can the Manager Do?</p>
<p>WORK HAS BEEN CENTRAL to man’s consciousness for untold ages. Man is
not truly defined as the toolmaker, but making tools, the systematic,
purposeful, and organized approach to work, is specific and unique human
activity. Work has, therefore, been a profound concern for
millennia.</p>
<p>Concern with work stands at the very beginning of what we call the
Western tradition.</p>
<p>In the Bible work is both man’s punishment for original sin and God’s
gift to make man’s fallen estate bearable. At the dawn of Greek
civilization, there is Hesiod’s great narrative poem, Work and Days—and
“work” stands before “days” in defining man’s estate and man’s life.
Life, Hesiod said, is “work over time.”</p>
<p>What was always a profound concern became central with the industrial
revolution.</p>
<p>The economic and social theories of the last two hundred years center
on work. This is true not only of Marxism, with its oversimplification
of history according to which society is always organized according to
the way the means of production, that is, the tools for work, are being
controlled; it is equally true of the orthodox economists, of the
philosophical sociologists of early nineteenth-century France, or of
most other “isms” of the last two hundred years.</p>
<p>However central work has been to man all along, organized study of
work did not begin until the closing decades of the nineteenth century.
Frederick W. Taylor was the first man in recorded history who deemed
work deserving of systematic observation and study. On Taylor’s
“scientific management” rests, above all, the tremendous surge of
affluence in the last seventy-five years which has lifted the working
masses in the developed countries well above any level recorded before,
even for the well-to-do. Taylor, though the Isaac Newton (or perhaps the
Archimedes) of the science of work, laid only first foundations,
however. Not much has been added to them since—even though he has been
dead all of sixty years.</p>
<p>The worker has been given even less attention—and the knowledge
worker has received so far almost none. Rhetoric there is aplenty, but
serious, systematic study has been confined to a few aspects of
working.</p>
<p>There is industrial physiology, dealing with the relationship of such
things as lighting, tool and machine speeds, design of the work place,
and so on, to the human being who is the worker; the fundamental work
here was done in the early years of this century, e.g., in the fatigue
and vision studies of the German-born Harvard psychologist Hugo
Muensterberg. Cyril Burt, an Englishman, might be called the father of
industrial psychology. During World War I he studied aptitudes, that is,
the relationship between the demands of specific manual work and the
physical skill; motor coordination, and reactions of individual workers.
Finally, in the early nineteenth century, Australian-born Elton Mayo,
working primarily at Harvard, developed human relations, that is, the
study of the relationship between people working together—though in
human relations work itself, that is, the task to be done, received
almost no attention.</p>
<p>The totality of “worker” and “working,” the totality of task and job,
perception and personality, work community, rewards and power relations,
has received practically no attention. It may be far too complex ever to
be truly understood.</p>
<p>The manager cannot wait till the scientists and scholars have done
their work. Nor can the worker. The manager has to manage today. He has
to put to work the little we know, inadequate though it is. He has to
try to make work productive and the worker achieving. It might,
therefore, be appropriate to put down what we know about work and
working.</p>
<p>The most important thing we know is that work and working are
fundamentally different phenomena. The worker does, indeed, do work; and
work is always done by a worker who is working. But what is needed to
make work productive is quite different from what is needed to make the
worker achieving. The worker must, therefore, be managed according to
both the logic of the work and the dynamics of working. Personal
satisfaction of the worker without productive work is failure; but so is
productive work that destroys the worker’s achievement. Neither is, in
effect, tenable for very long.</p>
<p>Work, as has been said in the preceding chapter, is impersonal and
objective. Work is a task. It is a “something.” To work, therefore,
applies the rule that applies to objects. Work has a logic. It requires
analysis, synthesis, and control.</p>
<p>As with every phenomenon of the objective universe, the first step
toward understanding work is to analyze it. This, as Taylor realized a
century ago, means identifying the basic operations, analyzing each of
them, and arranging them in logical, balanced, and rational
sequence.</p>
<p>Taylor worked, of course, on manual operations. But Taylor’s analysis
applies just as well to mental and even to totally intangible work. The
“outline” which the budding writer is being told to work out, before he
starts to write, is in effect scientific management. And the most
advanced, most perfect example of scientific management was not
developed by industrial engineers during the last hundred years. It is
the alphabet, which enables all words in a language to be written with a
very small number of repetitive and simple symbols.</p>
<p>But then—and Taylor did not realize this—work has to be synthesized
again. It has to be put together into a process. This is true for the
individual job. It is, above all, true for the work of a group, that is,
for a work process. We need principles of production which enable us to
know how to put together individual operations into individual jobs, and
individual jobs into “production.”</p>
<p>Some of Taylor’s fellow pioneers, especially Gantt, saw this clearly.
The Gantt Chart, in which the steps necessary to obtain a final work
result are worked out by projecting backward, step by step from end
result to actions, their timing and their sequence, though developed
during World War I, is still the one tool we have to identify the
process needed to accomplish a task, whether making a pair of shoes,
landing a man on the moon, or producing an opera. Such recent
innovations as PERT chart, critical path analysis, and network analysis
are elaborations and extensions of Gantt’s work.</p>
<p>But the Gantt Chart tells us very little about the logic that is
appropriate to given kinds of processes. It is, so to speak, the
multiplication table of work design. It does not even</p>
<p>tell us when to multiply, let alone what the purpose of the
calculation is.</p>
<p>Finally, work, precisely because it is a process rather than an
individual operation, needs a built-in control. It needs a feedback
mechanism which both senses unexpected deviations and with them the need
to change the process, and maintains the process at the</p>
<p>level needed to obtain the desired results.</p>
<p>Those three elements, analysis, synthesis into a process of
production, and feedback control, are particularly important in
knowledge work. For knowledge work by definition does not result in a
product. It results in a contribution of knowledge to somebody else. The
output of the knowledge worker always becomes somebody else’s input. It
is, therefore, not self-evident in knowledge work, as it is in making a
pair of shoes, whether the work has results or not. This can be seen
only by projecting backward from the needed end results. At the same
time, knowledge work, being intangible, is not controlled by its own
progress. We do not know the sequence of knowledge work in the way we
know—at least since Taylor and Gantt—the sequence of manual operations.
Knowledge work, therefore, needs far better design, precisely because it
cannot be designed for the worker. It can be designed only by the
worker.</p>
<p>The Five Dimensions of Working</p>
<p>Working is the activity of the worker; it is a human being’s activity
and an essential part of his humanity. It does not have a logic. It has
dynamics and dimensions.</p>
<p>Working has at least five dimensions. In all of them the worker has
to be achieving in order to be productive.</p>
<p>Machine Design and Human Design</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is, first, a physiological dimension. The human being is not a
machine and does not work like a machine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Machines work best if they do only one task, if they do it
repetitively, and if they do the simplest possible task. Complex tasks
are done best as a step-by-step series of simple tasks in which the work
shifts from machine to machine, either by moving the work itself
physicality, as on the assembly line, or, as in modern
computer-controlled machine tools, by bringing machines and tools in
prearranged sequence to the work, with the tool changing with each step
of the process. Machines work best if run at the same speed, the same
rhythm, and with a minimum of moving parts.</p>
<p>The human being is engineered quite differently. For any one task and
any one operation the human being is ill-suited. He lacks strength. He
lacks stamina. He gets fatigued. Altogether he is a very poorly designed
machine tool. The human being excels, however, in coordination. He
excels in relating perception to action. He works best if the entire
human being, muscles, senses, and mind, is engaged by the work.</p>
<p>If confined to an individual motion or operation, the human being
tires fast. This fatigue is not just boredom, which is psychological; it
is genuine physiological fatigue as well. Lactic acid builds up in the
muscles, visual acuity goes down, reaction speed slows and becomes
erratic.</p>
<p>The human being works best at a configuration of operations rather
than at a single operation. But also—and this may be even more
important—the human being is singularly ill-equipped to work at an
unvarying speed and a standard rhythm. He works best if capable of
varying both speed and rhythm fairly frequently.</p>
<p>There is no “one right” speed and no “one right” rhythm for human
beings. Speed, rhythm, and attention span vary greatly among
individuals. Studies of infants strongly indicate that patterns of
speed, rhythm, and attention span are as individual as are fingerprints,
and vary fully as much. Each individual, in other words, has his own
pattern of speeds and his own need to vary speeds. He has his own
pattern of rhythms, and he has his own pattern of attention spans.
Nothing, we now know, creates as much fatigue, as much resistance, as
much anger, and as much resentment, as the imposition of an alien</p>
<p>speed, an alien rhythm, and an alien attention span, and above all,
the imposition of one unvarying and uniform pattern of speed, rhythm,
and attention span. That is alien and physiologically offensive to every
human being. It results speedily in a buildup of toxic wastes in muscle,
brain, and bloodstream, in the release of stress hormones, and in
changes in electrical tension throughout the nervous system. To be
productive the individual has to have control, to a substantial extent,
over the speed, rhythm, and attention spans with which he is
working—just as an infant, learning to speak or to walk, has to have
substantial control over learning speed, learning rhythm, and learning
attention span.</p>
<p>While work is, therefore, best laid out as uniform, working is best
organized with a considerable degree of diversity. Working requires
latitude to change speed, rhythm, and attention span fairly often. It
requires fairly frequent changes in operating routines as well. What is
good industrial engineering for work is exceedingly poor human
engineering for the worker.</p>
<p>Work as Curse and Blessing</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The next dimension of man at work is psychological. Work, we know,
is both a burden and a need, both a curse and a blessing. Whether this
is genetic or culturally conditioned, we do not know—and it does not
greatly matter. By the time a human being has reached the age of four or
five, he has been conditioned to work. To be sure, child labor is
outlawed in most countries, but learning the fundamentals of being a
person, especially learning to talk, is work and creates the habit of
work. Unemployment we long ago learned* creates severe psychological
disturbances, not because of economic deprivation, but primarily because
it undermines self-respect. Work is an extension of personality. It is
achievement. It is one of the ways in which a person defines himself or
herself, measures his worth, and his humanity.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Loafing” is easy, but “leisure” is difficult. For younger people
especially, it is likely to mean frantic activity—or the hard work of
bucking traffic on overcrowded highways— rather than otium cum
dignitate, i.e., philosophical repose. “To be an aristocrat one has to
start learning dignified idleness in early childhood,” was a common
saying in that most snobbish of all Western societies, the Whig society
of late eighteenthand early nineteenth-century England. And, “The devil
finds work for idle hands,” says an even older proverb.</p>
<p>The peculiar characteristic of the work ethic of the West—which goes
back all the way to Saint Benedict of Nursia in the sixth century rather
than to Calvin in the sixteenth—is not that it glorified and sanctified
work. That was neither new nor particularly Western. It sanctified the
“calling”; it preached that all work was service and contribution and
equally deserving of respect. The Benedictine monks made manual work in
field and workshop equal to the work of praying and teaching. This was a
deliberate break with the earlier beliefs of antiquity which held that
the “gentleman” or the “free man” had to be freed from manual chores to
have time for higher work, for learning, for statecraft, for civic
duties, and for military service. As a result, antiquity—but also most
non-Western civilizations—ordered different kinds of work in a hierarchy
of personalities, with manual work pertaining to the ignoble, whether
slave, peasant, or artisan, and soldiers’ and knowledge work pertaining
to the full personality. Neither Socrates nor Cicero believed in
idleness; on the contrary, their full personality was working harder
than the ignoble or obscure—and did more demanding, more responsible
work. When the Chinese Mandarin retired to his ancestral estate after a
successful government career, he was not supposed to lead a life of
leisure. He was supposed instead to take up other but even more
productive work, calligraphy and painting, music and writing. And the
justification of these activities was above all their social
contribution; in the Confucian social ethic, these pursuits are
necessary to maintain the social harmony on which all else depends.</p>
<p>*First in the studies which Paul F. Lazarsfeld and Maria Jahoda
conducted in the twenties among chronically unemployed textile workers
in Austria.</p>
<p>There is little doubt, however that the commercial and industrial
revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries brought a sharp
step-up in the hours man worked— farmers, machine tenders, merchants,
and industrialists alike.</p>
<p>In large measure this reflected a sizable improvement in living
conditions and above all, in nutrition, which greatly increased the
physical energy available for work just as the eighteenth-century
English draft animal, whether horse or ox, could do far more work in the
course of a year than its grandsire a hundred years earlier had been
able to do, because the invention of the silo provided adequate food
during the winter months). No matter how horrible living conditions were
in the nineteenth-century slums of the industrial towns—or today in the
slums and shanty towns that ring Latin America’s cities—they were better
with respect to food than the living conditions under which the landless
laborer or the weavers and spinners in the cottage industries had
subsisted. If anyone doubts this he need only note the food on which
seamen in the sailing vessels were supposed to live and work; there are
abundant records in such literary classics as Dana’s Two Years Before
the Mast, Melville’s Typee and Moby Dick, or in the once widely popular
naval stories of Captain Marryat. Yet sailors, by all reports, were the
best-fed workers, both because the work was hard and made great physical
demands and because of the everpresent danger of mutiny.</p>
<p>The great increase in working in these centuries also represented a
shift in values.</p>
<p>Economic rewards became more meaningful—mostly, perhaps, because
economic satisfactions became more generally available. The proletarian
in the slums of Liverpool or Manchester could not buy much; he lacked
purchasing power. But purchasing power would not have helped his
grandfather, the landless laborer; there wasn’t anything much around to
buy.</p>
<p>The rejection of the work ethic—if there is such a phenomenon outside
of the headlines—therefore does not represent hedonism. In part it
represents a reaction against long decades of overworking, and a
righting of the balance. In larger part it may, however, represent a
return to earlier elitist work concepts which relate certain kinds of
work to nobility or to baseness of the person. What lends support to
this hypothesis is the strong, positive value which the educated young
people who supposedly repudiate the work ethic give to the work of
teacher and artist. Teaching and art, however, are far more demanding
taskmasters than tending machines or selling soap.</p>
<p>The workless society of the futurist utopia may, indeed, be ahead.
Should it come, it would, however, produce a major personality crisis
for most people. It is perhaps fortunate that so far there is not the
slightest fact to support the prediction of the imminent demise of work.
So far the task is still to make work serve the psychological need of
man.</p>
<p>Work as Social and Community Bond</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Work is social bond and community bond. In the employee society it
becomes primary access to society and community. It largely determines
status. For a man to say, “I am a doctor” or “I am a plumber” is a
meaningful statement about himself, his position in society, and his
role in the community.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps more important, work, since time immemorial, has been the
means to satisfy man’s need for belonging to a group and for a
meaningful relationship to others of his kind. When Aristotle said that
man is a zoon politikon, i.e., a social animal he said in effect that
man needs work to satisfy his need for community.</p>
<p>To be sure, few people are determined in their social and community
functions solely by and through the work group to which they belong.
Most people have other societies and communities. It is by no means
unusual to find a man who ranks low socially in his work group but who
is a “big shot” elsewhere; the inconspicuous engineer who is a big man
in the Boy Scouts or in his church, for instance. But even for this man,
work will provide much of his companionship, group identification, and
social bond.</p>
<p>Work is for most people the one bond outside of their own narrow
family—and often more important than the family, especially for the
young not-yet married and for older people whose children have grown up.
This is exemplified strongly by the experience of</p>
<p>companies who hire mature women for part-time work. They make the
most loyal employees. The work place becomes their community, their
social club, their means of escaping loneliness, with their own man at
his job and the children gone.</p>
<p>The Bell Telephone Company, for instance, has many women employees
who leave the job to raise a family but a dozen years tater become
available for part-time work. They are hired to handle clerical peak
loads, especially in such large-scale financial work as new stock or
bond issues, mailing dividends or annual reports, and so on. The work,
when available, is usually rushed and high-pressure, the hours long, and
the pay far from exceptional. Yet the competition for a place on the
roster is intense, and the morale of the group exceptionally high. When,
for whatever reasons, a few rnonths go by without such work, the “old
girls” will start to call in and ask, “How soon can I come in again? I
want to see my friends; I want to know what they are doing; I miss their
company.”</p>
<p>Similarly every company that has polled its retired employees has
found the same reaction. “What we miss isn’t the work; it’s our
colleagues and friends.” “What we want to know isn’t how the company is
doing but what the people do with whom we worked, where they are, how
they are coming along.” “Don’t, please, send me the annual report,” a
retired senior vice-president of a big company once said in a burst of
candor, “I’m no longer interested in sales. Send me the gossip. I miss
even the people I couldn’t stand.”</p>
<p>This last comment puts the finger on the greatest strength of the
work bond and its singular advantage compared to all other bonds of
community. It is not predicated on personal likes or dislikes. It can
function without making emotional demands. A man can work very well with
somebody whom he never sees away from the job, and for whom he feels
neither friendship nor warmth nor liking. He can even function well in a
work relationship with somebody whom he cordially dislikes—if only he
respects the other man’s~ workmanship. But the fellow worker can also be
a close friend with whom one spends as many hours away from work as
possible, with whom one goes hunting or fishing, spends one’s vacation,
spends one’s evenings, and shares much of one’s life. The work
relationship has an objective, outside focus, the work itself. It does
make possible strong social and community bonds that are as personal or
as impersonal as one desires.</p>
<p>This may explain why, throughout man’s history, and above all, among
primitive peoples, work groups have always been sexually differentiated.
Men work together and women work together. But we rarely hear, either in
history or in cultural anthropology, of work groups of mixed sex. Men
hunt and women tend the village. Men build boats and women grow yams. In
Europe women have traditionally milked the cows, in America men; but on
neither side of the Atlantic has milking been done by sexually mixed
groups.</p>
<p>The Economic Dimension</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Work is a “living.” It has an economic component the moment a
society adopts even the most rudimentary division of labor. The moment
people cease to be self-sufficient and begin to exchange the fruits of
their labor, work creates an economic nexus, but also an economic
conflict.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no resolution to this conflict. One has to live with it.
Work is a living for the worker. It is the foundation of his economic
existence. But work also produces the capital for the economy. It
produces the means by which an economy perpetuates itself, provides for
the risks of economic activity and the resources of tomorrow, especially
the resources needed to create tomorrow’s jobs and with them the
livelihood for tomorrow’s workers. There is need in any economy for a
wage fund and for a capital fund.</p>
<p>But the capital fund is in direct competition with the workers’ need
for a livelihood here and now. Marx tried to deny the need for a capital
fund. The great appeal of Marxism to the working man was precisely that
it presented capital accumulation as exploitation and as unnecessary.
The great appeal of Marxism was its prophecy that the capital fund would
disappear once the workers owned the means of production. This very soon
was seen as a total misunderstanding. No matter how bitterly Lenin
attacked the German “revisionist socialists” who pointed out in the
early years of this century that the capital fund was an objective
necessity and not founded in social or power structure, every com-</p>
<p>munist regime, most of all the Soviet Union, has put the capital fund
into the center of its economic planning. In other words, they all have
realized that profit is not a result of power, let alone exploitation,
but objective necessity.*</p>
<p>Still, it does little good to argue, as the classical economists did,
that there is no conflict between the demands of the capital fund, that
is, the demands for a surplus, and the demands of the wage fund. The
classical economists argued that, in the long run, these two harmonize.
The worker needs the capital fund fully as much as he needs the wage
fund. He needs, more than anyone else, to be protected against the risks
of uncertainty. He, more than anyone else, needs the jobs of tomorrow.
The rapid improvement in wages and living standards of the American
worker has in large measure been the result of steadily increasing
capital investment, that is, the capital fund. The researches of Simon
Kuznets (first at the University of Pennsylvania and later at Harvard),
e.g., into capital formation in the United States, have demonstrated
this. But “the worker” is an abstraction. The beneficiary of the capital
fund is rarely the same worker who has made the contribution to the
fund. The capital accumulated in one industry, e.g., the American
textile industry in the l890s, went to finance a new industry such as
the chemical industry, rather than to create new jobs in the textile
industry. Also, the capital fund creates jobs and incomes tomorrow,
whereas the contribution to it has to be made today.</p>
<p>There is, in addition, the tremendous problem of comparative gains
and sacrifices among different kinds of workers. It is probably true, as
labor economists have argued (especially Paul Douglas, originally an
economist at the University of Chicago, and later for many years a
prominent U.S. senator), in their studies of real wages, that
trade-union activities do not—and cannot—much influence the total level
of real wages in an economy. It is still true, however, that one group
of workers, e.g., workers in the building trades, can and do obtain
sizable wage advantages at the cost of other groups of workers.</p>
<p>In other words, it is true that there is no ultimate conflict between
wage fund and capital fund but this is largely irrelevant for the
individual. For him there is a real and immediate conflict.</p>
<p>Work as Living and Work as Wage</p>
<p>There is an even more fundamental conflict between wage as living and
wage as cost. As “living,” wage needs to be predictable, continuous, and
adequate to the expenditures of a family, its aspirations, and its
position in society and community. As “cost,” wage needs to be
appropriate to the productivity of a given employment or industry. It
needs to be flexible and to adjust easily to even minor changes in
supply and demand in the market. It needs to make a product or service
competitive. It is determined, in the last result, by the consumer, that
is, without regard to the needs or expectations of the worker. Again,
here is conflict which cannot easily be resolved and can at best be
assuaged.</p>
<p>No society, no matter how designed, has been able to eliminate these
conflicts. Expropriating the capitalist, the traditional Marxist
formula, does not change the situation. All it might do is to make
possible a larger capital fund because the state has absolute control.
But even this Russia could achieve only by outlawing labor unions. Japan
has traditionally been able to minimize the conflict between wage as
living and wage as cost (see Chapter 20), but rising living standards
threaten the Japanese accommodation. The conflict between wage fund and
capital fund rages as fiercely in Japan as any place else. The
Yugoslavs, by vesting ownership of a plant in the worker’s plant
community, rather than in the state, hoped to abolish the conflict.
Under the Yugoslav system, the needs of the capital fund should be more
clearly apparent to the plant community than under any other system
known so far, but they are being resisted just as much. The Yugoslav
experiment is in danger of collapsing because of the inflationary
pressures generated by workers’ demands for more wages than the
enterprise can afford to pay either under the</p>
<p>*For a cogent restatement of the dilemma by a contemporary, orthodox
Marxist, see Michael Harrington, Socialism (Saturday Review Press,
1972).</p>
<p>aspect of wages as cost or in consideration of its own and the
economy’s need for the capital fund.</p>
<p>Worker ownership has been the alternative to both capitalism, that
is, ownership by the providers of capital, and nationalization, that is,
ownership by the government. It has a long—though not a very
distinguished—history. Today it is again being proposed seriously,
especially by such men as Ota Sik, the architect of the economic
liberalization in Czechoslovakia which the Russians crushed.</p>
<p>A financial stake in the business must always remain a secondary
interest to the worker compared to his job. Even in the most prosperous
business, profit, that is, the contribution to the capital fund, is
never more than a small fraction of wages. In manufacturing industries,
wage costs typically are 40 percent or so of gross sales. Profits after
taxes are rarely more than 5 or 6 percent, that is, one-eighth of wage
costs. In the total economy the wage and salary bill runs around 65
percent of gross national product, profits fluctuate from zero to 7
percent or so—they are at most one-tenth of the wage bill (most of the
remainder is income of small proprietors, farmers, shopkeepers,
professionals, that is, in effect, another compensation for labor rather
than contribution to the capital fund, i.e., profits).</p>
<p>Profits, at their lushest, can, therefore, rarely contribute more
than a very small additional bonus—welcome but not fundamental.</p>
<p>It is also highly debatable whether worker ownership is in the
worker’s own financial interest. No enterprise will be profitable
forever. And if the worker then, as in the typical worker-ownership
plan, is dependent for his future, e.g., for his retirement benefits, on
investment in the company he works for, he is exceedingly vulnerable.
The worker should no more than any other investor have all his financial
eggs in one basket. In that respect, the approach to pensions adopted in
the United States in the last twenty-five years— development of a
pension fund which invests broadly, and typically does not invest at all
in the business that employs the future beneficiaries—is financially far
sounder and far more in the worker’s own financial interest than worker
ownership in the enterprise he works for.</p>
<p>From a theoretical point of view, the developments in the United
States during the last twenty or thirty years would seem to represent
the optimal approach to the resolution of these conflicts. The employees
of American business are gradually becoming the true “owners” through
their pension funds and mutual funds, which have become the dominant
investors in—the American economy. By now these institutional investors,
i.e., the trustees for the employee and his savings, control, in effect,
the large publicly owned American corporations. America, in other words,
has socialized ownership without nationalizing it. Yet this has by no
means resolved—or even lessened—the conflict between wage fund and
capital fund and between wage as living and wage as cost.</p>
<p>It would help if we learned to think and speak of the costs of
capital and of the costs of the future rather than of profit. (It would
also, as was said in Chapter 6, result in raising profitability
requirements). But it would only help; it would not make the conflicts
go, away. They are built into this situation, whether business operates
in a market economy or in a government-run one, whether it is privately
owned, government-owned, or plant community-owned.</p>
<p>The Power Dimension of Working</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>There is always a power relationship implicit in working within a
group, and especially in working within an organization.</li>
</ol>
<p>The farmer of old who tilled his own stony acres had to impose on
himself a very strict discipline. What he wanted to do was not very
relevant, if haying had to be done. But the forces to which he was
subordinated were impersonal. They were wind and weather, season and
frost, or the impersonal forces of a market. But in any organization, no
matter how small, there has to be a personal authority. The organization
member’s will is subordinated to an alien will.</p>
<p>The imposition of the clock on a man’s life which forces him to come
to work at a given hour might appear a trivial exercise of power, and
one that affects everybody equally. But it came as a tremendous shock to
pre-industrial people, whether peasants in developing countries, the
former craftsmen in the mills of England in the early years of the
industrial revolution, or Blacks from the ghettos of the American city
today. In an organization jobs have to be designed, structured, and
assigned. Work has to be done on schedule and in a prearranged sequence.
People are promoted or not promoted. In short, authority has to be
exercised by someone.</p>
<p>Anarchists are right in their assertion that “organization is
alienation.” Modern organization theorists such as Yale University’s
Chris Argyris who hope for organization without alienation are romantics
(though many of their concrete proposals for “participation” are highly
constructive, and needed). Modern society is an employee society and
will remain one. This means power relationships that affect everybody
directly and in his capacity as a worker. Authority is an essential
dimension of work. It has little or nothing to do with ownership of the
means of production, democracy at the work place, worker representation
at the board of directors, or any other way of structuring the “system.”
It is inherent in the fact of organization.</p>
<p>The Sixth Dimension: The Power Dimension of Economics</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>In al1 modern, organization there is what might be called a sixth
dimension of working a need for authority with respect to economic
shares.</li>
</ol>
<p>Power and economics are inextricably tied together in the modern
organization, whether business enterprise, government agency,
university, or hospital. Apportioning the economic rewards of the
members of the institution demands a central organ of authority with
power of decision. The reason is not capitalism or any other “ism.” It
is the fundamental fact that the modern institution is an organ of
society, existing to provide satisfactions outside of itself. It,
therefore, must obtain its revenue from the outside—either from a
customer in the marketplace, from the taxpayers through a budget-making
authority, or from preset fees paid by users such as patients in a
hospital, patrons of the post office, or students in a college. At the
same time, the contribution of the individual member of the institution
cannot be directly related to the revenue. It is impossible to say, even
approximately, how much of the sales of a business an individual
employee contributes, whether chief executive or lowliest sweeper. The
same is true of hospital or university. Does the great scholar in
ancient Chinese with his six graduate students contribute more or less
than the graduate assistant teaching English composition to a freshman
class of 150? And what about the dean? All one can say is that
everybody’s contribution is, in theory, indispensable, although not
everybody’s contribution enters into every single product or
performance, nor is everybody’s contribution in any way equal in
importance, skill, or difficulty.</p>
<p>An authority is, therefore, needed which divides the revenue
available among the members. The institution itself, whether business
enterprise or hospital, is necessarily a redistributive system.</p>
<p>Where the contributions are simple, similar, and few in number,
redistribution on the basis of complete equality is possible. This is,
for instance, the case in the Israeli kibbutz, where everybody works on
the farm, producing a very few products, most of them for</p>
<p>internal consumption, that is, for basic self-sufficiency. But the
moment the kibbutz went into industrial production, as a good many did,
it had to abandon the principle of primitive socialism on which it had
been founded and under which everybody receives exactly the same. It had
to become an employer. In Israel the Trade Union Federation owns most of
industry and is the country’s leading employer. Most of Israel’s
industry is, in effect, “socialized,” but that has not in any way
changed the power position of, the “employer” nor eliminated the
problems of labor relations. While the kibbutz has had enormous
psychological and political impact on Zionism, its economic role in
Israel is almost negligible and is shrinking. Kibbutzim now contain less
than 5 percent of Israel’s population; and the young are leaving them
for the fleshpots of the consumer society of the cities.</p>
<p>The simple fact that the results of a modern institution always lie
outside of itself and that, therefore, the economic rewards for its
members always come from the outside and are not determined internally,
inescapably leads to power and authority. In fact, it creates two power
relationships. There is a power relationship between management and
labor. But the various groups within the work force, while in a common
power relationship to management, also stand in sharp and intense
competition to each other with respect to their relative shares in the
total “product” available for internal distribution.</p>
<p>Marx might have been excused, a century ago, for believing that the
transfer of the title of ownership would resolve this problem—though his
predecessors, the utopian socialists, especially the French such as
Fourier, saw, long before Marx, that the problem lay in the nature of
modern institutions rather than in “exploitation,” ownership, or any
other legal, political, or social structure. Fourier in particular saw
that the industrial democracy required a completely self-contained and
self-sufficient economic unit, that is, something like an Israeli
kibbutz.</p>
<p>If the last hundred years have taught us anything, however, it is
that the distribution problem is generic rather than historical. It
cannot be manipulated away. There has to be a decision how to divide the
revenue available from the outside among the members inside the
enterprise. The moment the institution, business, hospital, or other,
produces more than a very few simple commodities, meant mostly for
consumption within the group, the relationship between the individual
input and the institution’s output can no longer be determined
“impersonally” or “scientifically.” At this moment also, equality of
reward becomes at once impossible—as the Russians learned in the
thirties, and as all other socialist experimenters, e.g., the Yugoslavs
and the Chinese, have learned since.</p>
<p>There has then to be a redistribution and an authority to make the
redistribution decisions. Redistribution, however, is, in effect, a
political rather than an economic decision. It is influenced and
restrained by a great number of forces: supply and demand, social
convention, traditions, and so on. But in the last analysis, a decision
by authority and a decision based on power structure and power
relationships has to be made somehow by somebody. And this decision, no
modern institution—and least of all, the business enterprise—can
escape.</p>
<p>The Fallacy of the Dominant Dimension</p>
<p>These dimensions of working—the physiological, the psychological, the
social, the economic, and the power dimension—are separate. Each
can—and, indeed, should—be analyzed separately and independently. But
they always exist together in the worker’s situation and in his
relationship to work and job, fellow workers and management. They have
to be managed together. Yet they do not pull in the same direction. The
demands of one dimension are quite different from those of another.</p>
<p>The basic fallacy of our traditional approaches to working has been
to proclaim one of these dimensions to be the dimension.</p>
<p>Marx—and most other economists—saw the economic dimension as
dominating everything else. If only economic relationships could be
changed, there would be no more alienation. Marxism became bankrupt when
it became apparent that the “expropriation” of the “exploiters” did not
fundamentally change the worker’s situation and his alienation</p>
<p>because it did not change in any way any of the other dimensions (and
did not indeed even change the economic problem).</p>
<p>This explains, by the way, the vogue of the “young Marx” among
Marxists today.</p>
<p>This—largely fictitious—personage is said to have seen alienation as
the existential evil of the social system and as moral rather than as
purely economic. But it did not take the mature Marx long to realize
that neither program nor action could be based on such general and vague
Weltschmerz.</p>
<p>Elton Mayo, to give another and radically different example, saw the
dominant dimension as the interpersonal relations within the work group,
that is, in psychological and social aspects. And yet it is not only
true that one cannot “hire a hand; the whole man always comes with it”;
the work itself matters and affects group relations. And neither the
economic nor the power dimension were seen by Mayo and his
associates.</p>
<p>These dimensions stand in highly complex relationship to each other.
They are a true “configuration” but one that changes rapidly as the
worker’s circumstances change.</p>
<p>The late Abraham H. Maslow, the father of humanist psychology,*
showed that human wants form a hierarchy. As a want of a lower order is
being satisfied, it becomes less and less important, with a want of the
next-highest order becoming more and more important. Maslow applied to
human wants what might be called “marginal utility”—and his was a
profound and lasting insight. Maslow put economic want at the bottom and
the need for self-fulfillment at the top. But the order is not of first
importance. What matters is the insight that wants are not absolute; the
more one want is being satisfied, the less its satisfaction matters.</p>
<p>But what Maslow did not see is that a want changes in the act of
being satisfied. As the economic want becomes satisfied, that is, as
people no longer have to subordinate every other human need and human
value to getting the next meal, it becomes less and less satisfying to
obtain more economic rewards. This does not mean that economic rewards
became less important. On the contrary, while the ability of the
economic reward to provide a positive incentive diminishes, its capacity
to create dissatisfaction, if disappointed, rapidly increases.† In
Herzberg’s words, economic rewards cease to be “incentives” and become
“hygiene factors.” If not properly taken care of that is, if there is
dissatisfaction with the economic rewards—they become deterrents.</p>
<p>This is, we now know, to be true of every one of Maslow’s wants. As a
want approaches satiety, its capacity to reward and with it its power as
an incentive diminishes fast. But its capacity to deter, to create
dissatisfaction, and to act as a disincentive rapidly increases.</p>
<p>Two vice-presidents in the same company whose salaries are only a few
hundred dollars apart are equals economically. At that salary level, the
income tax is so high as to make the pay differential meaningless. Yet
the vice-president with the lower salary may be eaten up by frustration
and envy. No matter how good his income, it will be a thorn in his side.
The same applies all the way down the organization. Every trade-union
leader knows that his biggest problem today is not absolute pay scales.
It is the pay differentials among various kinds of workers within his
union. There is no way of satisfying either the skilled worker who
insists on receiving 20 percent more than the semiskilled man, or the
semiskilled man. They are equally dissatisfied. If the pay differential
is being narrowed, the skilled worker will feel that he has been
deprived. And if the differential is not being narrowed, the semiskilled
worker will feel deprived.</p>
<p>But also, contrary to what Maslow seemed to imply, the various
dimensions of man at work change their character as they approach being
satisfied. Pay, as we have just seen, becomes part of the social or
psychological dimension rather than the economic one.</p>
<p>*Especiaily in his book, Motivation and Personality (Harper
andandandand Row, 1954).</p>
<p>†This was first noted in my book, The New Society. Since then
Frederick Herzberg has provided ample documentation in his two books,
The Motivation to Work (Wiley, 1959) and Work and the Nature of Man
(World, l966).</p>
<p>The opposite can also happen; power and status can become the basis
for economic demands. In Yugoslav industry, for instance, the worker
representatives on the workers’ council, who hold positions of great
social prestige and considerable power, almost immediately want more
money as well. At the least, they want perquisites—housing, an office, a
secretary, preferential prices at the company store, and so on—which
are, as they see it, economic rewards befitting their new rank.</p>
<p>We need to know much more than we now know about the dimensions of
working and about their relationships. We are dealing with a
configuration likely to defy analysis.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the manager has to manage now. He has to find
solutions—or at least accommodations—which will enable him to make work
productive and the worker achieving. He has to understand what the
demands are. He cannot expect to succeed by continuing the practices of
the last two hundred years. He will have to develop new approaches, new
principles, and new methods—and fast.</p>

<p>UNSKILLED WORK, skilled work, and knowledge work, but this is is not
the work that is unskilled, skilled, or knowledgeable, it is the</p>
<p>worker. Skill and knowledge are aspects of working. The work itself
is the same whether it requires no skill or high skill, a lot of
knowledge or very little.</p>
<p>To make a pair of shoes one used to have to be “highly skilled.” For
almost a century now, we have been able to make shoes practically
without skill. It would be no great trick (though probably uneconomical
to automate shoemaking fully so that it requires no manual work. Yet the
shoe itself has hardly changed. Nor has the process. It requires the
same steps, from preparing leather, to cutting, forming, stitching, and
gluing. The steps are being carried out in the same sequence, to the
same requirements and standards, and result in the same finished
product. The work of shoemaking remains the same, even though</p>
<p>tools and skill requirements have changed drastically. Only an expert
could tell whether a shoe had been made entirely by hand and with great
craft skill or in an entirely automated process.</p>
<p>This may seem to be quibbling. Yet the realization that work is
general and generic and that skill and knowledge are in the working
rather than in the work is the key to making work productive. The
generic nature of work—certainly as far as manual or any other
production work is concerned—implies that work can be worked on
systematically, if not scientifically.</p>
<p>The first step toward making the worker achieving is to make work
productive. The more we understand what the work itself demands, the
more can we then integrate the work into the human “activity we call
working. The more we understand work itself, the more freedom we can
give the worker. There is no contradiction between scientific
management, that is, the rational and impersonal approach to work, and
the achieving worker. The two complement each other, though they are
quite different.</p>
<p>Whatever study of work has been done so far has confined itself to
manual work—for the simple reason that, until quite recently, this was
the main work around. In describing what is known about making work
productive, this book, therefore, of necessity, focuses on manual work.
But the same principles and approaches also apply to any other
production work, e.g., to most service work. They apply to the
processing of information, that is, to most clerical work. They even
apply to most knowledge work. Only the applications and the tools vary.
Precisely because work is general and generic, there is essentially
no</p>
<p>difference among work the end product of which is a thing, work the
end product of which is information, and work the end product of which
is knowledge.</p>
<p>Making work productive requires four separate activities, each having
its own characteristics and demands.</p>
<p>First, it requires analysis. We have to know the specific operations
needed for work, their sequence, and their requirements.</p>
<p>But we also need synthesis. The individual operations have to be
brought together into a process of production.</p>
<p>Third, we need to build into the process the control of direction, of
quality and quantity, of standards, and of exceptions.</p>
<p>Fourth, the appropriate tools have to be provided.</p>
<p>One more basic point needs to be made. Because work is objective and
impersonal and a “something”—even if it is intangible, like information
,or knowledge—making work productive has to start out with the end
product, the output of work. It cannot start with the input, whether
craft skill or formal knowledge. Skills, information, knowledge, are
tools; and what tool is to be applied when, and for what purpose, must
always be determined by the desired end product. The end product
determines what work is needed. It also determines the synthesis into a
process, the design of the appropriate controls, and the specifications
for the tools needed.</p>
<p>The Analysis of Work</p>
<p>The analysis of work—known by such names as work study, scientific
management, and industrial engineering—is by now almost a century old.
As said earlier, it goes back to Frederick W. Taylor’s work in the 1880s
on individual manual operations, such as his famous study of shoveling
sand in a steel mill. It was essentially completed in its present form
shortly after Taylor died during World War I. In those war years and in
the period immediately following, Taylor’s most productive disciples,
Frank Gilbreth and Henry Gantt, added to Taylor’s scientific management
what might be called the script and the syntax for the analysis of
work.</p>
<p>Gilbreth studied, identified, and classified all the motions involved
in manual work, such as “lifting,” “moving,” and “putting dawn.” His
Therbligs (Gilbreth spelled backwards), which list the entire range of
manual operations, specify how each can best be done, what motion it
requires, and how much time it needs, are not, as sometimes has been
said, an alphabet. They are more like Chinese ideographs, that is,
symbols of a fundamental unit which in themselves contain all the
information needed to engineer them.</p>
<p>Gantt, at the same time, addressed himself to the configuration of
operations in work.</p>
<p>His Gantt Chart, which starts out with the desired end product and
then outlines every step needed to attain it, with its place in the
sequence and the time needed, created, in effect, a syntax for work.</p>
<p>Not only has the discipline of work analysis been with us for a long
time; the practice has become general too. The industrial engineer is a
common feature of production work, in the factory, in transportation,
and increasingly in clerical work. Industrial engineering is a
recognized academic discipline with a tremendous literature of its own.
And the impact, as has been said earlier, has been almost
overwhelming.</p>
<p>Managers, therefore, tend to believe that they know all they need to
know about industrial engineering. They may be excused for believing
that the analysis of work is as useful, but also as well known a tool as
cost accounting, for instance, and requires very little managing on
their part. They are convinced they know the essentials. The analysis of
work, they would tell a questioner, consists essentially of the
following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Identification of all operations necessary to produce a known end
product, a known piece of work.</p></li>
<li><p>Rational organization of the sequence of operations so as to make
possible the easiest, smoothest, and most economical flow of
work.</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis of each individual operation and its redesign so as to
make possible its most efficient performance—including the provision of
the appropriate tools, the needed information, and the required
materials where and when needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Integration of these operations into individual jobs. And this is
actually what, in essence, the books on industrial engineering say and
what the courses on this subject teach. It is, however, not—or at least
not truly—what the analysis of work has to be to be effective.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Taylor—and this is perhaps the only valid criticism of a great man’s
work—may have been responsible for the common failure to see something
so obvious, for Taylor always took the end product for granted. His
focus was the individual task rather than the joint result.</p>
<p>To start out with the task rather than with the end product may
result, however, in beautiful engineering of work that should not be
done at all. One cannot, as Taylor did, assume that the end product is
rational, systematic, consistent. In most processes it represents little
but untested assumptions, a lot of history, traditions and customs, and
geological strata of human errors. Anyone who starts out with an
analysis of the final product, the work itself, will soon find himself
asking the question “Why do we do this and why do we do that?” Usually
there is no answer other than, “We have always done it.” What proportion
of inefficiency, that is, of lost productivity, can be contributed to
the unquestioning acceptance of the final product as given, no one
knows, but I have heard experienced industrial engineers put it as high
as 30 percent of total cost and total effort—and I would not consider
this estimate improbably high.</p>
<p>The manager, therefore, needs to know that his work analysts have to
participate in the design of product and process. Obviously the finished
product cannot be engineered primarily to make work easier. Its basic
specifications are set by the needs and values of the user and not by
those of the producer. But within the restraints set by these basic
specifications, there is usually considerable leeway to design a product
or service so as to be produced efficiently or inefficiently, simply or
with unnecessary complications, with economy of work or wastefully.</p>
<p>The next—and much better known—weakness of the traditional definition
of work analysis is that it includes something which does not belong in
it. The fourth, and last, step which most managers—and most industrial
engineers, at least in the West—would include in their definition of
industrial engineering is not truly part of the job. Laying out jobs is
no longer analysis. Or rather, the analysis that is required is not that
of work, but that of working. And while the industrial engineer has a
role to play in this process, it is a totally different role from the
one he plays in the analysis of the work (as will be discussed in
Chapter 21).</p>
<p>The inclusion of job design in work analysis is responsible in large
measure for the traditional resistance to industrial engineering on the
part of workers. It is largely responsible for the hostility of the
intellectual to modern technology, and to modern industry and
organization altogether.</p>
<p>But what is resisted and criticized is a misapplication of work
analysis rather than work analysis itself. Taylor is usually blamed for
the resulting “dehumanization” of the worker, especially by today’s
psychologists, but this is unfair and unjust.*</p>
<p>*To belittle Taylor because in 1880 he did not know post-Freudian
psychology is, as I said at another occasion (when I received in 1967
the Taylor Key of the Association for Advancement of Management),
somewhat like belittling Isaac Newton for not knowing quantum mechanics
or non-Euclidian geometry in 1690.</p>
<p>Taylor did not invent the assembly line—he had, in fact, nothing to
do with it. Taylor’s aim from the beginning was strictly in accord with
the most humanist approach to working. Taylor, as his writings show,
knew that making the work productive was but the first step. But he also
knew that neither an empty stomach nor a spent and broken body is a good
foundation for the full life. Taylor addressed himself to the priority
task of creating the economic and physical base for the worker’s
welfare. It was not an accident that Taylor’s most ardent supporter was
the greatest American humanist of the early years of this century, Louis
D. Brandeis, later to become the great liberal Supreme Court justice and
the strongest fighter on the Court for human rights and human dignity.
It was Brandeis, for instance, who, as Taylor’s self-appointed public
relations man, coined the term “scientific management” to get attention
for Taylor’s work.</p>
<p>The fact remains, however, that scientific management or industrial
engineering has been content to stop where Taylor stopped. Few of its
scholars and practitioners have concerned themselves with working, i.e.,
with the synthesis of operations into a job.*</p>
<p>The manager needs to know that the logic of work analysis and the
analysis of job structure are two different logics. The one is the logic
of work, the other the logic of working.</p>
<p>The last and most common misunderstanding of the industrial engineer
is the belief that work analysis is the whole job. It is only the first
step in making work productive. Analysis identifies individual specific
operations, their sequence, and their interrelationships. It deals with
pieces. It is not concerned with the process of production as a whole,
with its structures, its economy, or its performance.</p>
<p>The Principles of Production</p>
<p>Production is not the application of tools to materials. It is the
application of logic to work. The more clearly, the more consistently,
the more rationally the right logic is applied, the less of a limitation
and the more of an opportunity production becomes.</p>
<p>This definition implies that there must be principles of production.
There must be a small number of basic models, each with its own
constraints, its own requirements, its own characteristics. The
definition further implies that the more closely a process of production
can be designed according to one of these principles, the smoother, the
more effective, and the more productive it will be.</p>
<p>Each system of production makes its own demands on management—in all
areas and on all levels. Each requires different competence, skill, and
performance. One set of demands is not necessarily “higher” than
another, any more than non-Euclidian geometry is “higher” than Euclidian
geometry, but each is different. Unless management understands the
demands of its system of production, it cannot truly make work
productive.</p>
<p>Such understanding is particularly important today when many
processes—in manufacturing as well as in information work—are moving
from one system of production into another. If this move is considered a
mere matter of machines, techniques, and gadgets, the enterprise will
reap inevitably only the difficulties of the new system. To reap its
benefits management must realize that the new system involves new
principles, and must understand what these are.</p>
<p>There are four such principles of production known to us so far. Each
has been worked out for industrial production, that is, largely for
traditional manual work. But each is equally applicable to producing and
handling information, that is, to most clerical work. The principles are
applicable also to knowledge work, at least to knowledge work concerned
with the learning of known knowledge (i.e., already available and
learnable) and its application.</p>
<p>*An important exception was one of Taylor’s disciples, Allen
Mogensen, who, in the 1920s, pioneered what he called “work
simplification”—startlingly similar to what is now being rediscovered as
job enrichment,” if not way ahead of it.</p>
<p>There are two general rules for advancing production performance and
pushing back limitations. First, the limitations on production are
pushed back further and faster the more consistently and thoroughly the
principles pertaining to the system in use are being applied. Second,
the systems themselves represent a distinct order of advance, with
unique-product production the least advanced, process production the
most advanced. They represent different stages of control over physical
limitations. This does not mean that opportunities for advance lie
everywhere in moving from the unique-product system to the
process-production system. Each system has its specific applications,
requirements, and limitations. But we advance to the extent to which we
can organize parts of production on the principles of a more advanced
system and learn, at the same time, how to harmonize different systems
within the same process.</p>
<p>There are also two general rules concerning the demands on management
competence made by each system. First, the systems differ not just in
the difficulty of their demands, but in the variety of competence and
the order of performance. Management, in moving from one system to
another, has to learn how to do new things rather than learn to do old
things better. Second, the more we succeed in applying consistently the
principles of each system , the easier it becomes for management to
satisfy its demands.</p>
<p>Each management has to meet the demands of the system it ought to
have according to the nature of its products and process, rather than
those of the system it actually uses. Being unable or unwilling to apply
what would be the most appropriate system results only in lack of
performance; it does not result in lower demands on management, but
inevitably increases the difficulties of managing the business.</p>
<p>One case in point is basic steelmaking, which has, in the batch
process, primarily a unique-product system. There is probably no
industry that has worked harder or more successfully on perfecting a
unique-product system. Yet the problems the managements of basic-steel
companies face are process-production problems: high fixed capital
requirements and the need for continuous production, resulting together
in high break-even points; the need for a high and constant level of
business; the need to make basic investment decisions for a long time
ahead, etc. As a result the cost structure of the steel industry is that
of capital-intensive process production. At the same time the
basic-steel industry enjoys few of the economic benefits of process
production. The steel industry is thus caught in a perpetual squeeze
between the cost characteristics of process production and the revenue
characteristics of unique-product production. In periods of very rapid
growth and extremely high demand, i.e., in the early stage of
industrialization by and large, it can be very profitable for a few
years. But over any extended period of time, steel industry
profitability will always be marginal and inadequate to the industry’s
own needs—until such time as the basic steelmaking process shifts from
mechanical unique-product production to what would in effect be a
chemical flow-process.</p>
<p>It is, in summary, of major importance in managing a business to know
which system applies; to carry its principles through as far as
possible; to find out which parts of production can be organized in a
more advanced system and to organize them accordingly; and to know what
demands each system makes on management.</p>
<p>Where historical and technological obstacles have barred the
organization of production in the appropriate system, as in the
basic-steel industry, it is a major challenge to management to work
systematically on overcoming these obstacles. Emphasis should not be on
working a little more effectively what is basically, the wrong
system.</p>
<p>Because it acted counter to these rules, the steel industry has
misdirected a great deal of its tremendous technological efforts.
Focused on improving the traditional process, the efforts will turn out
to have been wasted when steelmaking will finally become process
production—and that point is not very far off.</p>
<p>A business using the wrong system has to satisfy all the demands that
the appropriate and more advanced system would make on management. Yet
it does not have the where-</p>
<p>withal to pay for them, for this can come only out of the increased
ability to produce which the more advanced system provides.</p>
<p>All four principles of production provide the foundation for both
production work and achieving worker. All are compatible with the
dynamics of working or can be made compatible. When they fail to do so,
it is not the principle that is at fault; it is its misapplication.</p>
<p>Specifically, the failure of mass production to give the worker
achievement is essentially poor engineering. It is either failure to
understand the meaning of mechanization (see the next chapter; or it is
failure to understand the difference between work and working (as will
be discussed in Chapter 21).</p>
<p>Unique-Product Production</p>
<p>What, then, are these four systems of production and their
principles? In the first, the production of a unique product, each
product is distinct. Of course, strictly speaking, there is no such
thing as manufacturing unique products—they are produced only by the
artist. But building a battleship, a big turbine, or a skyscraper comes
close to turning out a unique product. So does the traditional way of
building houses, one at a time, and, in most cases, batch production in
a job shop.</p>
<p>What is unique in unique-product production is the product. In fact,
unique-product production is always organized around standardized tools
and it typically works with standardized materials.</p>
<p>Goldsmiths and silversmiths use the same tools and they produce very
similar final products. Yet the two crafts have traditionally been
organized separately because they use different materials. This may be
an extreme case, and overspecialization; but it illustrates the
fundamental characteristics of unique-product production.</p>
<p>In unique-product production the basic organization is by homogeneous
stages. In the building of the traditional single-family house—one of
the oldest examples of uniqueproduct production—we can distinguish four
such stages. First, digging the foundation and pouring concrete for the
foundation walls and the basement floor. Second, erecting frame and
roof. Third, installing plumbing and wiring equipment in the walls.
Finally, interior finishing. What makes each of these a distinct stage
is that work on the house can stop after each is completed, without any
damage—even for a fairly long time. On the other hand, within each
stage, work has to be carried right through; or else what has been done
already will be damaged and may even have to be done again. Each stage
can be varied from house to house without too much trouble or adjustment
and without delaying the next stage. Each of these stages by the inner
logic of the product, that is, the house, is an entity in itself.</p>
<p>Unique-product production, with its organization of the work by
homogeneous stages, is radically different from craft organization, in
which a carpenter does all the carpentry, a plumber all the plumbing,
etc. Properly organized, unique-product production does not go by craft
skills but by stage skills.</p>
<p>The model is the telephone installation man who, without being a
skilled electrician, carpenter, plumber, or roofer, installs electric
wiring, saws through boards, makes a ground connection, and can take up
a roof shingle and replace it. In other words, either every man engaged
in the work of a particular stage must be able to do everything needed
within that stage; or, as in the building of a big turbine, there must
be an integrated team for each stage which contains within itself all
the stage skills needed. No skill is needed by individual or team that
goes beyond the requirement of that particular stage.</p>
<p>This is largely how the U.S. succeeded in building ships at such a
tremendous rate during World War II. It was not mass production that
resulted in the unprecedented output of ships. It was the division of
the work into homogeneous stages; the systematic organization of the
work group for the specific requirements of each stage; and the
systematic training of a large number of people to do all the work
required within one stage. This</p>
<p>in turn made possible the progressive scheduling of the work flow,
which was the greatest timesaver.</p>
<p>Rigid and Flexible Mass Production</p>
<p>Most people when they hear the term “mass production” think
immediately of the assembly line. But this is misunderstanding. Very
little mass production work is assembly line work. The assembly line is
the rare exception even in true mass production of the most rigid kind.
A good example is the assembly of electronic appliances such as radios,
TV sets, and telephones. It is true mass production, but one worker does
the entire operation from start to finish. The operations are indeed in
sequence. In that sense there is a line which goes from putting in the
first rivet to soldering all wiring connections, and then to final
inspection. But there is no line in the traditional sense. The work
itself never moves but stays at the individual work place.</p>
<p>Altogether the assembly line, despite its prominence in popular
imagination and in the sociological literature of “alienation,” is quite
rare in reality. Only one out of every fifty workers in America in 1970
worked on an assembly line. Even in manufacturing employment assembly
lines are rare—with fewer than 6 percent of American manufacturing
workers doing assembly-line work. Assembly-line work is even the
exception in the automobile industry; of General Motors’s 550,000
employees, only one-third do assembly-line work.</p>
<p>The traditional picture of the assembly line assumes, moreover, that
there is only rigid mass production. The principle of production that is
clearly in the ascendant is “flexible”</p>
<p>mass production.</p>
<p>What both principles have in common is that the final product is
assembled out of standardized parts. In unique-product production, tools
and materials are standardized. In mass production, the parts are also
standardized. And they, in turn, are, as a rule, built of standardized
parts as well. Mass production, in other words, assembles rather than
makes.</p>
<p>Modern mass production goes back to the making of rifles for the
American infantryman in the War of 1812. By 1880, long before Henry”
Ford, mass-production methods were actually in wide use throughout
American industry, and also in such plants as the German Zeiss Optical
Works and the Ericsson telephone plant in Sweden.</p>
<p>It may be the origin in gun manufacture which explains why for long
years “rigid”</p>
<p>mass production was considered to be the only available
mass-production technology. In making guns for soldiers it is obviously
highly desirable to have a completely uniform end product. It is highly
desirable that each rifle be like any other, use exactly the same
ammunition, require exactly the same cleaning, and be repaired easily
with parts taken from any rifle.</p>
<p>In rigid mass production, therefore, the end product—in addition to
tools, materials, and parts—is also standardized and uniform. Flexible
mass production, however, uses standardization of parts to make possible
diversity of end products.</p>
<p>Historically, flexible mass production antedates rigid mass
production by many hundreds of years. It was developed long before
industrialization. We know far too little about the building methods of
the ancients to know what production processes they applied, though it
is highly likely that the profusion of Greek and Roman temples in Europe
and the Near East could have been built only on the basis of flexible
mass production. For the Gothic cathedral, and for all the thousands of
Gothic churches built in Northern and Western Europe between 1100 and
1300, the evidence is fully available. There is not the slightest doubt
that these were the product of flexible mass production. The basic
parts, building blocks, roofing, and so on, were fully standardized. But
their assembly varied with the architect’s plan. Only windows,
ornaments, doors, i.e., the features that make one church look
different, were produced by unique-product production methods. But—and
this is vitally important—all these are features that are added on to
the basically finished building. Diversity of product, in other words,
in the Gothic cathedrals, and even more in the small Gothic parish
church, was provided at the very end of the process. The basic</p>
<p>process itself was standardized, though it resulted in a very large
diversity of finished products.</p>
<p>Similarly, the enormous number of Japanese Buddhist temples built
between A.D. 700 and 1600 were also built by flexible mass-production
methods. Each of these temples looks quite different. And yet each is
put together out of essentially standardized parts, such as beams
standardized as to width and length; standardized roofing and roof
tiles; standardized intervals between the various levels of a pagoda,
and so on. The individually distinctive features, e.g., doors or iron
grilles or the ornamentation of the tiles on the roof’s edge, were added
only at the very end, thus creating brilliant diversity based, however,
on true mass production, that is, on standardized parts assembled
according to prearranged patterns. Japanese temples, built of wood,
burned down again and again. But they could always be rebuilt exactly
from drawings showing only exterior appearance. Everything structural
was so standardized that any skilled craftsman knew exactly what it had
to be.</p>
<p>Without mass-production methods, neither the Gothic cathedrals and
churches nor the Japanese temples could have been built. They had to be
built essentially by semiskilled, if not unskilled, workers. Skilled men
in the numbers that would have been needed to erect such major
structures in such enormous quantities were simply not available in what
were then poor, largely illiterate, and thinly populated areas.
Mass-production methods alone made it possible for ordinary farm folk,
drafted for a few months of work in the summer, or volunteering for the
spiritual rewards of participation in such holy work, to do the great
bulk of the work, with skilled artisans needed only to supervise and to
execute the distinctive finishing touches.</p>
<p>When the principle of mass production was rediscovered, however, in
the nineteenth century, uniform standardized end products were taken for
granted. Henry Ford illustrates this perfectly.</p>
<p>When Henry Ford said, “The customer can have a car in any color as
long as it’s black,” he was not joking. He meant to express the essence
of mass production as the manufacture of uniform products in large
quantity. Of course, he knew that it would be easy enough to give his
customer a choice of color; all that was needed was to give the painter
at the end of the assembly line three or four spray guns instead of one.
But Ford also realized, rightly, that the uniformity of the product
would soon be gone altogether once he made any concession to diversity.
To him the uniformity of the product was the key to mass production.</p>
<p>However, from the beginning, the alternative, flexible mass
production, was actually being used—though rarely understood. Otto
Doering, who built the first mail-order plant for Sears, Roebuck,
designed a genuine mass-production plant to handle an enormous diversity
of individual orders. The individual items in the mail-order catalog
were the “standardized parts.” Every order went through the same process
in being filled. But what was finally assembled was not a “standard
order,” it was whatever the customer had ordered, on one shipping
pallet, with one invoice, and yet with a range of diversity almost
beyond belief. Very early in Sears, Roebuck’s history the catalog came
to contain many thousands of items, which meant theoretically—and to a
large extent practically—that the end product had to be assembled in
millions of different combinations, with the probability of any two
orders being identical practically nil.</p>
<p>Even earlier, Ernst Abbé (as discussed in Chapter 20) had organized
lens-making in the Zeiss Optical Works in Jena, Germany, as flexible
mass production.</p>
<p>Another example, this one from the 1930s and 1940s, was the
farm-equipment manufacturer in Southern California who designed and made
specialized cultivating machines for large-scale farming on irrigated
land. Every one of his designs was unique. He made, for instance, a
machine that performs, with various attachments, all operations needed
in large-scale cucumber growing—from preparing the hills in the spring,
to harvesting cucumbers at the right stage of their growth, to pickling
them. He rarely made more than one of each machine at a time. Yet every
one of his more than seven hundred different machines was made up
entirely of mass-produced, uniform, standardized parts, which some-</p>
<p>one in the American economy turned out by the thousands. His biggest
job was not to design a machine that identified cucumbers of the right
ripeness for pickling, but to find a mass producer of a part that,
though originally designed for an entirely different purpose, would,
when put on the cucumber cultivator, do whatever was needed.</p>
<p>The specific technique for applying the principle of flexible mass
production is the systematic analysis of products to find the pattern
that underlies their apparent diversity. Then this pattern can be
organized so that the minimum number of standardized parts will make
possible the assembly of the maximum number of products. The burden of
diversity, in other words, is taken out of manufacturing and shifted to
assembly.</p>
<p>There are obviously processes in which standardization of the end
product is desirable. Rifles for the infantryman are but one example.
There are other processes in which enough diversity of appearance can be
engineered into a rigid mass-production process to satisfy the market
need.</p>
<p>General Motors often points out that there are so many options on its
cars—colors, body styles, seat fabrics, accessories, and so on—that the
customer can actually choose from millions of different final-product
combinations. More important—though not often advertised by General
Motors—is the fact that all makes of General Motors (Chevrolet, Pontiac,
Oldsmobile, Buick, Cadillac) use the same frames, the same bodies, and
very substantially the same engine, let alone the same brakes, the same
lighting system, and so on. Yet the cars look different, have different
characteristics, and represent a great variety of combinations of basic
standardized elements. All these cars (excepting only Cadillac) are put
together on the same assembly line. All of them are, in effect, products
of rigid mass production and are turned out in a process that has
remained almost unchanged since Henry Ford’s early days.</p>
<p>To obtain the appearance of diversity from rigid mass production
requires, however, a volume of production for every one of the parts to
be assembled on which few industries, other than the automobile
industry, can count. Unless the volume for any one constituent type is
very large, rigid mass production can, as Ford saw, turn out only a
truly standardized product.</p>
<p>American Motors, for instance, is at a very real disadvantage because
it has to turn out a fair diversity of end products—at least in looks
and styling—without the General Motors volume. And yet it produces
300,000 to 400,000 cars a year—a very large volume by any measure other
than that of the American automobile industry.</p>
<p>For most mass-production processes the preferred principle should be
flexible mass production. Until recently, however, mechanization and
flexible mass production were hard to combine. The tools appropriate to
mass production were inherently inflexible.</p>
<p>The advent of the computer is rapidly changing this, for the
computer, and especially the small process computer, which is, so to
speak, a part of the machine or machine tool, eliminates the
inflexibility of the tool and with it the main obstacle to flexible mass
production. In traditional mass production—and in traditional machine
production altogether—any change in product or process requires stopping
the process. Change requires altering the machine setup, cleaning tools,
changing the position of work and of materials, changing speeds, and so
on. As long as this had to be done by hand, it required far too much
time. Worse still, changing one tool meant stopping the entire process.
Computer control, e.g., numerical control on a machine tool, eliminates
the time need. The computer can make the change instantly on the basis
of’ a preset command. Instead of taking hours, changes take seconds, or
at most minutes.</p>
<p>This is not automation. (On mechanization and automation, see the
next chapter.) This is a radical improvement in mechanization. Two
examples are the shipbuilders of Japan and Sweden. That these two
countries were able in the sixties to gain a dominant position in world
shipbuilding and all but crowd out such old and experienced producers as
the Scots at the Clydeside and the Germans in Hamburg is not the result
of lower wages. Swedish wages are, if anything, higher than wages in
Germany and Scotland. It is the result of the application of computer
control to convert shipbuilding, traditionally a uniqueproduct process,
to flexible mass production. As a result, Swedish and Japanese
shipyards</p>
<p>can build ships from standardized parts and yet turn out final
products of great diversity, not only in appearance but also in size,
structure, speed, and so on. The job is still, as in the traditional
unique-product process, organized by stages. But within each stage the
process is a mass-production process in which the parts are standardized
but in which the configuration of parts has almost infinite flexibility.
The process results both in much lower cost and in much greater
speed—and above all, in almost complete predictability of the building
cycle and in such tight control of scheduling that—almost for the first
time in the history of shipbuilding—a reliable and dependable delivery
date for the finished product can be set far in advance.</p>
<p>Computerized control of process changes has also been applied—and
with similar results—to other products, e.g., to the making of glass
bottles.</p>
<p>Computerized control requires redesign of the process. It is
difficult, expensive, and requires hard, time-consuming analysis of
product and process. But wherever it has been used to convert a rigid
process to flexible mass production, there has been major cost
reduction-sometimes reaching 50 to 60 percent. Production speeds have
been substantially increased. Scheduling has become as reliable as in
rigid plant production. At the same time, true marketing has become
possible.</p>
<p>The architects of the Gothic cathedrals and churches could design a
church to fit the needs of the individual customer, the bishop,
cathedral chapter, or parish, and yet have what, in effect, was a
standardized production process using standardized parts and with
semiskilled, if not totally unskilled, labor.</p>
<p>Similarly, flexible mass production can turn out a very large variety
of truly different products and yet have a totally standardized process
of production. For this reason one can predict that it is flexible mass
production that will increasingly become the massproduction system of
tomorrow, with rigid mass production increasingly confined to the very
small number of end products where basic uniformity is in itself a
fundamental customer need and customer specification.</p>
<p>Process Production</p>
<p>The fourth system is process production. Here process and product
become one.</p>
<p>The classic example of a process industry is the oil refinery. The
end products that a refinery will obtain out of crude oil are determined
by the process it uses. It can produce only the oil distillates for
which it is built and only in definite proportions. If new distillates
have to be added or if the proportion of the various distillates is to
be changed significantly, the refinery has to be rebuilt. Process
production is the rule in the chemical industries. It is, with minor
variations, the basic system of a milk-processing or a plateglass
plant.</p>
<p>Process production is an integrated system. There are no stages in
it, there are no parts. There is only one process. Typically, process
production starts with one basic material. But by the logic of that
material, e.g., crude oil, it ends up with a multitude of very different
end products for very different end uses. The process itself has high
rigidity— more rigidity even than rigid mass production. The end product
typically has far more diversity than even unique-product
production.</p>
<p>Because process production is a system, it has tremendous economies
and tremendous productivity where it is appropriate. But where it is
misapplied, or where it is not truly developed into process
production—as in the example of basic steelmaking given above—its
rigidity and cost tend to outweigh its benefits.</p>
<p>Process production is, or should be, the model for a great many
production processes which historically have been organized as
unique-product production or as rigid mass production. The basic
difference in performance between a well-run telephone system and most
post offices is that telephone service is organized as process
production and as a true system. Post offices everywhere are, organized
at best on mass-production principles— and, in effect, by and large,
still on unique-product principles with “stages” of the process and with
totally different processes for different “products,” that is, different
kinds of</p>
<p>mail, or letters versus parcels. To be sure, it is easier to move
electronic impulses than it is to move paper, let alone heavy parcels.
But wherever a mail service has been able to improve its performance
significantly, it has done so by trying to approximate its system to a
model of process production.</p>
<p>All transportation, whether of mail, freight, or people, should be
considered process production. The means of transportation always have
to be a system, have to have great rigidity, have to be scheduled and
have to be integrated with one another. But each letter, each parcel,
let alone each passenger, has a separate destination. There is,
therefore, almost infinite diversity of “end products.” And this only a
system, that is, essentially, process production, can organize and can
perform effectively, productively, and with high satisfaction to the
customer.</p>
<p>What Each Principle Demands</p>
<p>Each of the four principles has different characteristics and makes
different demands. Each has its own costs. Each has its own
vulnerabilities. Each has its own strengths.</p>
<p>another example, but so is the hospital. These are inherently highly
vulnerable industries or services which combine the worst of both
worlds, such as high break-even points and inflexibility of product mix.
We usually do not know how to put such industries on true
process-production, but the more closely such industries or services can
attain genuine process production in part of their activities, the
better will they perform, both in quality and in economic terms.</p>
<p>Process production requires continuing high volume. The typical
process plant in the chemical industry or in the plate-glass industry
can operate only at or near peak capacity. Otherwise it has to be shut
down. It has great diversity of product mix, but it has little or no
flexibility. It can produce only the products for which the system has
been designed. It requires extreme skill in design. It may require very
high skill in operation, e.g., on the part of schedulers, pilots, and
maintenance people of an airline. But it may also require very little
skill, as in the typical oil refinery. But it requires a very high
degree of judgment by practically every employee.</p>
<p>Since product and process have, so to speak, become one in process
production, new products will be created by changes in the process, even
if there is no demand for them in the existing market. This is a common
occurrence in the chemical industry, but also typi-</p>
<p>cal of the airlines industry. When a new, bigger plane comes in, a
new market has to be created. It is characteristic of process production
that the volume of production cannot be increased gradually. The minimum
unit of production—whether a new chemical plant or a new jumbo jet—is so
large that it requires a quantum jump in production, and with it new
markets.</p>
<p>In unique-product production, management’s first job is to get an
order. In both kinds of mass production, the job is to build an
effective distributive organization and to educate the customer to adapt
his wants to the available range of product variety. In process
production, the first task is to create, maintain, and expand a market
and to create new</p>
<p>markets. To distribute kerosene lamps free to the Chinese peasants to
create a market for kerosene—the famous Standard Oil story of eighty
years ago—is a good example of what this means.</p>
<p>In the unique-product system the time span of decisions is short.
Under both types of mass production it becomes longer: a distributive
organization, for instance, may take ten years to build. But under a
process system, decisions are made for an even longer future.</p>
<p>Once built, the productive facilities are relatively inflexible and
can be changed only at major expense; the total investment is likely to
be large; and the development of a market is long range. The marketing
systems of the big oi1 companies are good examples.</p>
<p>The more advanced the production organization, the more important are
decisions for the future.</p>
<p>Each system requires different management skills and organization.
Unique-product production requires people good at technical functions.
Mass production, rigid and flexible, requires management trained in
analytical thinking, in scheduling, and in planning. Flexible mass
production as well as process production require management trained in
seeing a business as a whole, in conceptual synthesis, and in
decision-making.</p>
<p>There are significant differences with respect to the work force and
its management.</p>
<p>Unique-product production can usually adjust its work force to
economic fluctuations, keeping in bad times only foremen and a nucleus
of the most highly skilled. It can, as a rule, find what other skills it
needs on the labor market. Precisely because they have limited skill,
the workers in mass production must increasingly demand employment
stability from the enterprise. The work force in process production
represents such an investment in judgment that the business must try to
maintain employment stability. It is neither accident nor philanthropy
that the oil companies—typical process businesses—have tried so hard to
keep employment steady even in bad depression years.</p>
<p>These four principles of production are “pure” types. But there are
many businesses— and equally many non-businesses (the hospital would be
an example)—where different parts of the work are best organized on
different principles. How then can these principles be combined?</p>
<p>The hospital needs unique-product production. Patient care can be
given only on that basis, even though the great majority of patients in
any hospital fall into a very small number of highly predictable and
highly repetitive categories, such as childbirth, minor orthopedic
surgery, cardiac cases, and so on. At the same time, the medical
services, from X-ray to medical laboratory to physical therapy, have to
be organized in what is essentially flexible mass production. The same
applies to the “hotel” services, i.e., the feeding of patients, the
housekeeping, and so on. Other parts of the hospital require a genuine
system design, i.e., process production. Yet all this has to be
integrated into one hospital, one management, and one process and has to
be delivered to the same patient at his bedside.</p>
<p>Few industrial processes are as complicated as the hospital; but an
airline also has a variety of “production principles” which inform
different parts of its work, and even different parts of its
transportation operation.</p>
<p>The rule for the use of different principles in one organization is
simple—though by no means easy of application. Different principles of
production can work well in the same organization; but they must not be
mixed.</p>
<p>It is fairly easy to organize, for instance, the bulk of the
production process as mass production, either rigid or flexible, with
unique-product production both at the end and at the beginning of the
process, which was what the builders of the Gothic cathedrals or the
Japanese temples did. This is what today’s mass builder of houses does
who designs three or four basic models from the same standardized parts,
then adapts these models to a fairly large variety of different end
products with different floor plans, different lighting and decorating
schemes, and different exterior trim.</p>
<p>But where different principles of production have to be mixed
together, there is confusion, there is friction, there is inefficiency.
This is a basic problem of the hospital, where no one so far has found a
way to separate what are, in effect, quite different principles of
production in the delivery of patient care.</p>
<p>Managers, therefore, need to understand what principles of production
are truly appropriate to the different stages of the production process
they have to manage. They have to analyze the logic of each stage. And
if they find that they require different principles to be organized,
they have then to try to separate these stages so that they do not
interfere with each other. This organization, however, cannot be done by
imitating what others are doing. It requires that management—whether of
a business or of a public-service institution—analyze its own work and
its own production processes. It also requires that management
understand the basic principles of production, their characteristics,
their limitations, and their requirements.</p>

<p>ORK IS ductive,</p>
<p>A PROCESS, and any process needs to be controlled. To make work pro-
therefore, requires building the appropriate controls into the process
of</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>Specifically the process of production needs built-in controls in
respect to:</p>
<p>• its direction;</p>
<p>• its quality;</p>
<p>• the quantity it turns out in a given unit of time and with a given
input of working;</p>
<p>• its standards, such as machine maintenance or safety;</p>
<p>• its economy, that is, the efficiency with which it uses
resources.</p>
<p>Each work process needs its own controls. There is no “standard”
control, but all con- trol systems have to satisfy the same basic
demands and have to live up to the same over-</p>
<p>all specifications.</p>
<p>The most extreme cases of controls impeding work are not to be found
in manufactur- ing but in retailing and in the hospital. There controls
have been permitted to become an end in themselves to the point where
they encroach upon the work and seriously harm it.</p>
<p>In the department store a great many controls are undoubtedly
required. Each sale has to be recorded. There is need for information
for inventory control, billing, credit, deliv- ery, and so on. But in
far too many department stores the salesperson is supposed to pro- vide
all the control information. As a result, he or she has less and less
time to do what he is paid for, that is, selling. In some large American
retail stores, two-thirds of the sales- person’s time is devoted to
paperwork with only one-third left tor selling. The remedy is a simple
one and works wherever tried. Once the salesperson has done his or her
job, which is to serve the customer, the entire paperwork is turned over
to a separate clerk who ser- vices a number of sales people and does the
paperwork for them. The impact both on the ability of salespeople to
sell and on their morale is astonishing.</p>
<p>In the hospital, controls are needed in tremendous number, from
medical records to billing to the handling of insurance claims for
reimbursement, for the patient’s personal physician, and so on. Yet to
have the nurse handle this paper flood—as is the practice in the typical
hospital—is gross miscontrol. It makes the nurse deskbound so that she
has less and less time for the patient. Again the remedy is simple: a
floor clerk, usually a young management trainee in hospital
administration, who takes on the information load including providing
the nurse with what she needs herself to do her own job. This is not
only economical, since management trainees are paid much less than
nurses (and should, of course, be paid less), it is, above all, the
proper use of scarce skills.</p>
<p>It should always be remembered that control is a principle of economy
and not of mo- rality (on this see Chapter 39, “Controls, Control, and
Management”). The purpose of control is to make the process go smoothly,
properly, and according to high standards. The first question to ask of
the control system is whether it maintains the process within a
permissible range of deviation with the minimum effort. To spend a
dollar to protect 99 cents is not control. It is waste. “What is the
minimum of control that will maintain the process?” is the right
question to ask.</p>
<p>Seventy years ago this was clearly understood by the men who built
Sears, Roebuck.</p>
<p>In the early days of the mail-order business, the money in incoming
orders was not counted. The orders were weighed, unopened. (These were,
of course, the days when cur- rency was still metallic.) Sears, Roebuck
had run enough tests to know what average weights corresponded to
overall amounts of money—and this was sufficient control.</p>
<p>Many years later, in the 1951s, Marks andandandand Spencer similarly
developed a system of minimum controls. The late Lord Marks, it is said,
was appalled at the paperwork he found when he visited one of the
stores. He forthwith ordered all paperwork to be stopped. Control
instead is exercised by frequent small samples—and this greatly in-
creased the ability of the people in the store to sell and with it the
profitability of the busi- ness. It also increased the morale of the
people at work. They were finally able to do their work rather than to
waste time and effort on controls which impeded them.</p>
<p>The second thing to know about controls is their basic
characteristics. Controls have to be preset. There has to be a decision
as to the desired performance and as to the per- missible deviation from
the norm. Control has to be essentially by “exception”: only sig-
nificant deviation from the norm triggers the control. As long as the
process operates within the preset standards, it is under control and
does not require any action.</p>
<p>Third, control has to be by feedback from the work done. The work
itself has to pro- vide the information. If it has to be checked all the
time, there is no control.</p>
<p>One implication of this—and a very important one—is that inspection
is not control.</p>
<p>Inspection, especially final inspection, is, of course, needed for
both goods and services. But if used as control, it fast becomes
excessively cumbersome, excessively expensive, and a drag on the process
itself. Above all, it does not really control, even if there is 100
percent inspection, that is, if every product is tested and analyzed.
The end result would still be poor quality, excessive defects, and
malfunction.</p>
<p>Inspection, in other words, is the control of the control system
rather than the control system itself. And it too, to be effective, has
to satisfy the specifications of control, above all, the principle of
economy.</p>
<p>The control itself has to be exercised where the malfunction is
likely to occur. The control action may then be performed by the
machinery itself. The classical example is the governor on Watts’s steam
engine. Another one is the thermostat that runs the central heating unit
of the modern home.</p>
<p>Or the worker may be alerted to take the proper remedial action—and
this is also feedback control. What is important is not who takes the
action but what action to take. Equally important is that the action be
taken as a result of the working of the process itself and at the place
where the action is appropriate, that is, the place where correction of
the process, or a change in its direction (such as shutting off or
turning on the heating unit), is to be performed.</p>
<p>This implies that a control system has to designate the key point at
which control is to be built in. This is not primarily a technical
decision but a managerial one. At what point in the system is there
sufficient information to know whether control action is needed? At what
point in the system is there scope for effective action? Control at any
other point is undesirable. But so is control when it is too late, or
very late, to prevent damage. What part of the process requires
continuous control? What part requires control only at spe- cific
stages? Where is preventive control needed, or at least control at a
very early stage? And, where is control essentially remedial? These are
questions that are rarely being asked in designing a control system. Yet
unless they are being asked—and answered—a control system that truly
satisfies the needs of the work process cannot be designed.</p>
<p>Routines and Exceptions</p>
<p>A control system can control only the regular process. It must
identify genuine excep- tions, but it cannot handle them. It can only
make sure that they do not clog the process itself.</p>
<p>Any process is an attempt to make order out of the chaos of the
universe so that the great majority of phenomena, of actions, of
problems, of situations, can be routinized and do not require individual
and specific decision. A control system is a tool to enable men of
average competence to do things which if tackled as unique events could
be done only by exceptional skill, if not by genius. A control system
that violates this rule and tries to provide for handling the exceptions
will, therefore, defeat the process. It will sacrifice the 97 percent we
understand to the 3 percent we do not understand.</p>
<p>Exceptions can never be prevented but they can be eliminated from the
work process.</p>
<p>They then can be handled separately and as exceptions. To make a
control system take care of exceptions misdirects and undermines both
the work process and the control sys- tem.</p>
<p>The examples that best illustrate this are not to be found in
manufacturing industry but in the processing of information in the life
insurance business. Every life insurance com- pany handles every day a
veritable avalanche of death claims. Every life insurance com- pany has
learned that death claims have to be handled fast or else the company
rapidly loses its standing in the market. Hence, every life insurance
company long ago adapted the rule that routine death claims are to be
paid within twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>The great majority—well over 90 percent—of all the claims are routine
and need only to be checked off. Are all the needed forms provided? Is
all the required information in hand? If the answer is yes—and it should
not take more than a few seconds to find this out—payment is
authorized.</p>
<p>In a small number of cases, the information is not complete. The
death certificate is missing or it has not been signed by a physician or
it does not state a cause of death; the name on the death certificate is
different from the name on the policy; or the age is sig- nificantly
different, and other such, usually petty, clerical shortcomings.</p>
<p>Death claims are sorted alphabetically (or sometimes by area) when
they are received and then handed to a claims clerk to work up. In the
typical American company, until very recently, the claims clerk was
expected to handle all the claims in his or her area as they came in.
This usually meant that the claims clerk worked up a dozen claims and
then came to one where routine checking was not adequate control. The
claims clerk then be- gan to work on it. Sometimes he could settle the
problem in a few seconds, e.g., by send- ing it back to the agent in the
field with the appropriate form letter asking for whatever information
was lacking. But sometimes he had to spend half an hour or even an hour
on handling one claim. As a result, routine claims backed up. And by
twelve o’clock, the clerk was usually way behind, and routine claims
that should have been authorized for payment had not been processed.</p>
<p>The typical British insurance company handles this differently. There
the claims clerk inspects each claim to see whether it is routine or
not. Any claim that is not so simple that it can be cleared for payment
immediately is handed over to a special small group of “ex-</p>
<p>perts,” usually older and highly experienced claims clerks, who then
begin to work on it. In the meantime, the flow of routine claims
continues unimpeded.</p>
<p>There is yet another way of handling this, used in some European and
Japanese life in- surance companies. The claims clerk puts aside, on a
separate table, every claim which he cannot immediately clear for
payment. So do three or four other claims clerks working within the same
claims unit. When the pile of routine claims has dwindled and the pile
of non-routine claims has grown, say, around 10:30 or 11 in the morning,
the claims clerks then divide the unusual claims among them according to
their workload at the moment. As a result, they usually manage to work
up all claims, routine and non-routine, by noon in the morning and by
closing time in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The traditional American system is misapplication of control. It
subordinates the rou- tine to the exceptions. The traditional British
system is effective control. It eliminates the exceptions from the
process, which keeps flowing. But it stultifies the worker; it is a good
control system for a machine process rather than for human work. The
German or Japa- nese system satisfies both the demands of work and those
of working.</p>
<p>The best control system, however, is not found in business. It is the
differential diag- nosis of the physician as it was developed in the
early nineteenth century. The differential diagnosis proceeds from the
ascertainable systems in a preset order. It eliminates step by step all
the inapplicable diagnoses, that is, all the exceptions. It makes the
process of dis- covery into a routine.</p>
<p>To design a control system, one has to think through what is routine
and what is ex- ception.</p>
<p>The Patterns of Routines</p>
<p>There are three patterns of routines. First is the pattern in which
both input and output are highly standardized. This is the case in rigid
mass production—but in flexible mass pro- duction as well.</p>
<p>Life insurance claims belong in this pattern. The input is totally
standardized—a claim for payment because of one event, death of the
policyholder. The output is equally stan- dardized. It is a check in
payment of the claim. Only the amount of the check varies. And the
amount, of course, is determined in advance by the policy itself. The
handling of life insurance death claims is a perfect example of rigid
mass production—perhaps a better one than the automobile assembly line.
In this pattern, control consists of organizing the routine flow and
eliminating the exceptions to be handled separately.</p>
<p>In the second pattern, the apparent diversity of events actually
represents a configura- tion of sub-patterns, each of which is highly
routinized. One example is casualty insur- ance, such as insurance
against fire, burglary, losses at sea, and so on. Here there seems to be
bewildering variety both of risks and of claims. Actually, there are no
more than half a dozen patterns.</p>
<p>Another example is the hospital. The first impression is one of total
unpredictability.</p>
<p>Each “process,” i.e., each patient, seems to require a unique control
system of his own; this is the way most physicians see the hospital.
Actually, there are no more sub-patterns in a hospital than there are in
a casualty insurance business, let alone in many manufactur- ing
businesses. A dozen or so common illnesses account for 90 percent or
more of all patient days in the hospital. Each of these illnesses
requires medical care within a known and fairly narrow range of
procedures, makes predictable demands on hospital facilities such as
operating theaters, X-ray, medical laboratories, and physical therapy,
and has a predictable prognosis within a narrow range. For each there is
an average to which the great majority of events closely conforms. A
hospital can, therefore, be controlled by con- trolling a fairly small
number of preset patterns. The exceptions are important—indeed, they are
often the most difficult medical challenges. But they are being
controlled by be- ing taken out of the system and treated as genuine
exceptions, that is, as truly unique events.</p>
<p>Wherever a process seems unpredictable the most probable assumption
is that it actu- ally consists of a number of highly predictable
sub-patterns. They appear unpredictable only because they interfere with
each other. The key to designing a control system is to identify these
sub-patterns. Each can then be routinized, standards can be set, and a
con- trol system established that makes sure that the process operates
within a preset range of</p>
<p>Finally, there are processes where unique events prevail. They are
rare in manufactur- ing; even unique-product production usually consists
of a fairly small number of highly predictable, repetitive sub-patterns.
But unique-event processes are found, fairly fre-</p>
<p>quently, in some service work.</p>
<p>Workmen’s compensation insurance, which provides for the payment of
lost income and damages to people injured while working and as a result
of their work—but also for the medical costs and the rehabilitation of
men contracting occupation-related diseases— is such a process. No two
claims are basically alike. Each has to be treated as a separate claim,
with respect not only to the payment due, but to the medical, surgical,
or rehabilita- tion action required. Each frequently also calls for
changes in work methods or in the tools used in order to eliminate or
lessen the hazard for the future. Yet the claims adjuster of workmen’s
compensation insurers has to have almost complete authority to settle
claims. The great majority of claims is settled speedily, to the
satisfaction of both the em- ployer and the injured worker, and with a
high success in cure or rehabilitation. Work- men’s compensation plans
have a better record of medical performance than most medical practice
has.</p>
<p>The way to handle this pattern of unique events is to think through
and define the standards. What are the minimum standards which every
single piece of work, e.g., a set- tled workmen’s compensation claim,
has to satisfy in respect to the investigation of the claim, to the
management of the medical or surgical work needed, to the time it takes
for settlement, and so on? What, in other words, are the measurements by
which a claims adjuster can measure and direct himself? To be sure, even
in such a situation of unique events, there are patterns. But there are
too many, and each of them embraces too small a proportion of the total
phenomenon, to devise a control system for each pattern. The only
control—but a very effective one—is standards which enable the
individual worker to develop his own routine and his own control.</p>
<p>This last pattern is of particular importance because it is the
typical pattern for such knowledge work as teaching, medical practice,
and any other professional work. The pro- fessional, by definition,
works by himself. By definition he also deals with unique events—unique
at least within the small universe to which an individual professional
is exposed. And then control has to be by standards. The dissatisfaction
with the profes- sional that is so widespread today—whether teacher,
lawyer, or doctor—is largely based on the lack of such standards, that
is, on the lack of a control system appropriate to a unique-events
process.</p>
<p>Work and Tools</p>
<p>The final step in making work productive is to fit the right tools to
the work. Different kinds of work require different tools. There are far
too many tools, from very simple to very complex, and from very small to
giant, to be analyzed and presented even in the big- gest book. And tool
design, tool organization, and tool application are technical subjects
rather than managerial ones.</p>
<p>Yet the manager, whether he manages industrial production, the
processing of infor- mation, or knowledge work, needs to understand the
basic managerial requirements of tool usage.</p>
<p>A tool is not necessarily better because it is bigger. A tool is best
if it does the job re- quired with a minimum of effort, with a minimum
of complexity, and with a minimum of power.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, most assembly-line work, while fully
mechanized, is done with small hand tools. They are modified to serve
the particular job to be done. But they are still hammers, screwdrivers,
mallets, pliers, and so on. Good assembly-line tooling provides the
worker with the simplest tool he needs for a given job, when he needs
it, and wherever he needs it.</p>
<p>This needs to be stressed. For it is one of the weaknesses of
technology—or rather of technologists—that bigger is considered
better.</p>
<p>The worst offender throughout history has been the military. It has
always been hyp- notized by bigness and complexity. Some of the worst
military disasters of history have been the result. It was the worship
of bigness that defeated the Persians when they at- tacked Greece. The
Mongols in the thirteenth century overran Europe because the knights of
chivalry were hypnotized by “advanced technology.” They became the
victims of their own and their horses’ heavy armor and heavy weapons
while the Mongols, on small and light ponies, with a minimum of
weaponry, could ride rings around them. Similarly, Hitler lost in Russia
to a large extent because he put his trust in heavy tanks and in heavy
artil- lery which could not maneuver, let alone be supplied, on the soft
and roadless plains of Russia. And Vietnam taught a similar lesson.</p>
<p>Mechanization and Automation</p>
<p>The most important thing for a manager to know about tools and work
is, however, that tools are the bridge between work and working. Tools
serve the work. They also serve the worker. They must, therefore, be
engineered for making both work productive and the worker achieve. This
requires that the manager understand what mechanization is and what
constitutes proper mechanization.</p>
<p>Mechanization is a fairly recent word. Most people believe that it
pertains only to modern tools, that is, to the tools of an advanced
technology. But all tools are “mechani- zation.” Over the millennia we
have changed the energy source for tools—from human and animal muscle to
wind and water and to fossil fuels and nuclear power. But tools have
changed very little. Tools from the beginning were a uniquely human
phenomenon. All tools are an extension of man. They either extend his
body, as does the hammer, or they extend his mind, as do multiplication
table and computer. Or they provide man with ca- pacities for which his
own body is not engineered—such as the wheel or the ax. But all tools
are tools of man and must, therefore, serve him in his double need of
making work productive and worker achieving.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of fear today that modern technology is
becoming man’s master rather than his servant. The definitive comment on
this was given to me many years ago by a student who was one of the
early computer engineers. “I am being asked all the</p>
<p>time,” said the young man, “whether I am not afraid of becoming the
computer’s servant.</p>
<p>I do not understand the question. All I have to do is pull the
plug.”</p>
<p>While the fear of technology becoming the master and enslaving man is
unfounded— and professed by people who know nothing about technology and
understand even less (and who, in addition, tend to believe that
technology is an invention of the industrial revolution)—there is real
danger that mechanization will be misapplied. Mechanization to be
properly applied must always extend the sphere of human capacity, must
always add to man’s capacity to achieve. If it does not do this, it is
poor engineering. It will not even make work more productive. It will,
in effect, cut down output.</p>
<p>Specifically, there are two dangers to watch out for. The first is
the danger of making man a part of the machine. Men are very poor
machine parts. If the human effort is misengineered into the system so
that it does machine work, the system works poorly. The second danger is
to misuse the tool as a divisive element in the work group, thus
frustrat- ing man’s basic need to establish a community bond through
working.</p>
<p>The modern assembly line, as Henry Ford set it up, does both. Man on
the traditional automobile assembly line is, in effect, a part of the
machinery. He does very poorly, very slowly, and very sloppily what a
machine should be doing. This is the essence of doing one repetitive
motion at the same unvarying speed and rhythm over and over and over
again. Worse still, the automobile assembly line makes each man a threat
rather than a resource to his fellow worker. If one man on the line
works a little faster, he threatens his neighbor. Working at his most
productive, that is, with varying speeds and rhythms, be- comes a threat
to everybody else. And he cannot, by working better, help his neighbor.
He is confined to his operation.</p>
<p>This, it should be said again, is not inherent in the assembly line.
It is poor engineer- ing of the assembly line. We shall see (in Chapter
21) that these defects can be over- come—even on the traditional
automobile assembly line. They are, indeed, in the process of being
overcome. But they are symptomatic of what happens if managers—or engi-
neers—forget that tools are the bridge between work and working, and
engineer the tools so as to serve the work alone.</p>
<p>What is to be done when mechanization becomes inimical to working,
that is, when the organization of the tool that is most conducive to
making work productive threatens to do harm to working and worker? One
answer—the one that is available in most cases—is to re-engineer
mechanization, as will be discussed in Chapter 21. The other answer is
to transcend mechanization and move to automation.</p>
<p>The term automation is a fairly new one. It was coined in the late
1940s by a Ford Motor Company executive. The concept, however, is much
older.</p>
<p>The best illustration of what automation means antedates the term—let
alone public concern with the phenomenon—by many decades. It is the
telephone system. The tele- phone system does not work “untouched by
human hands,” nor does it operate without human work. The user, in
dialing the number he wants to reach, programs the system. And this is
“work.” But given these instructions, the system runs itself, switches
to the appropriate channels, returns a signal that tells the dialer
whether his call goes through or not, and disconnects at the end of the
conversation. It also does the ancillary work, such as recording the
calls for billing purposes. If need be, it could easily perform
additional chores such as signaling a repair center that a line is out
of order.</p>
<p>The telephone exchange exhibits the four principles of automation.
First, the entire process is seen as a system. There is, so to speak, no
beginning and no end. Everything is integrated. Second, the system is
based on the assumption that phenomena of the natural universe fall into
discernible patterns and can be routinized on the basis of a probability
distribution. Third, the system controls itself through feedback.</p>
<p>Finally, the human worker does not work. He programs. He makes
decisions based on judgment within the range of patterns the system is
designed to handle. He may be almost totally unskilled—as is the user of
the telephone. Or he may be exceedingly highly skilled, e.g., the people
who design microcircuits on automated equipment such as com- puters, to
be produced by totally automated equipment. But whether skilled or
unskilled,</p>
<p>the worker is discriminating. His tool is judgment rather than manual
or even conceptual skill.</p>
<p>Whenever mechanization reaches the point where the worker is
engineered to be a machine part, we can automate. We can design a
machine to do machine’s work. This</p>
<p>may not, in a given case, be desirable or economical. We may not even
have the technol- ogy as yet to do it, but it is always possible. It is
not necessarily the best alternative to re- engineering mechanization to
make it serve working as well as work, but it is always an alternative
that should be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Automation is not an arrangement of machines. It is not the ultimate
in mechanization.</p>
<p>It is a basically different concept. It can work perfectly without
any machines. The aba- cus, which Japanese and Chinese ten-year-olds use
with high speed and accuracy, is, in effect, automation and data
processing, fully as advanced and as sophisticated as anything the
computer does. It does not require machinery and advanced technology,
but it embod- ies the basic concept of automation.</p>
<p>Any work needs its tools. Any work, therefore, needs to be
mechanized. “The work- man is only as good as his tools”; but it is also
true that the tools work only as well as the workman. In designing tools
for work, therefore, the manager has to be conscious of both dimensions,
that is, of work and working.</p>
<p>Beyond Manual Work</p>
<p>Work analysis, principles of production, controls, and tools have
primarily been worked out, at least in systematic fashion with respect
to manual work. Up till very recently the bulk of all people did manual
work. Manual work, in turn, produced the overwhelming preponderance of
whatever was being produced.</p>
<p>In a modern economy and society, however, manual work is increasingly
of less im- portance—thanks primarily to our advances in understanding
and organizing work and our resulting ability to make work productive.
Hence, the question arises whether the same approaches, the same
concepts, and the same principles apply to other than manual work.</p>
<p>There is no question of the applicability of the same approaches and
the same princi- ples to manual work which is not technically,
production, that is, to manual work on the railroad, in construction,
and other kinds of physical work which the economist does not consider
to be agriculture, mining, or manufacturing, but “services.” This is a
distinction of great importance to economics but of none to management.
It is also clear that the same approaches, principles, and methods
apply, almost without change, to the processing of information, that is,
to most clerical work.</p>
<p>Turning out insurance policies, handling orders, billing, key punch
operations, and most accounting work are essentially production work.
Indeed, most clerical work is mass production—some rigid, some flexible.
It requires the same industrial engineering, that is, the same analysis
of work, as manual work, the same process of production, the same kinds
of control.</p>
<p>Processing information is easier to organize than most physical
production. Informa- tion always comes coded in fairly simple form,
electric impulses, figures, words, or, at its most complex, graphic
information composed of a few parts, i.e., light, shadows, and at most a
few colors.</p>
<p>Processing information, therefore, can always be done by
standardizing the parts and assembling the final product, that is, by
mass production.</p>
<p>Most true services work is not fundamentally different from producing
things insofar as the principles of work are concerned. Selling in a
retail store is basically flexible mass production. The individual sale
varies greatly. The process varies hardly at all. And it can be
organized in standardized parts. It is best organized so as to give the
retail clerk a pre- designed routine with the appropriate tools but with
wide latitude of judgment. Unless, however, the routine has been
designed and the tools supplied, even the best judgment on the part of
an experienced retail clerk will not produce sales.</p>
<p>ple, already mentioned, is the differential diagnosis which the
nineteenth-century physi- cian worked out. Even older is the
systematizing of the work of the surgeon—both the basic analysis and the
integration of steps into a process were done during the eighteenth
century, especially by the great English surgeon John Hunter
(1728-1793).</p>
<p>The blueprint also antedates modern work study—it is a product of the
mid-nineteenth century. It also is a systematic and purposeful
application of the same basic work con- cepts to the application of
knowledge.</p>
<p>The most important example of the application of the approaches and
principles of work study and work organization to a knowledge area is,
however, acquisition of exist-</p>
<p>ing knowledge, that is, learning.</p>
<p>For thousands of years people have been talking about improving
teaching—to no avail. It was not until the early years of this century,
however, that an educator asked, “What is the end product?” Then the
answer was obvious: It is not teaching. It is, of</p>
<p>course, learning. And then the same educator, the great Italian
doctor and teacher Maria Montessori (1870-1952), began to apply
systematic analysis of the work and systematic integration of the parts
into a process—without, of course, any awareness that this was what she
was doing. Montessori’s own system is surely not the “final answer.” But
her approaches have provided the foundation for all subsequent work,
e.g., that of the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget, who has studied how
children learn, and of the American behav- iorists who have studied
learning as a dynamic process of continuous work with its own logic and
its own controls. The English open classroom in which the work of these
people has been embodied in a real learning environment may be the first
major change in educa- tion and the first systematic learning work. Its
methodology is specifically the analysis of the work, the integration of
the work into a process—a cross between flexible mass pro- duction and
true process production—the design of the appropriate control system and
the provision of the appropriate tools.</p>
<p>These examples show that the application and learning of knowledge
are fundamen- tally no different from any other work. To be sure, the
product is entirely different and so are the materials and the tools.
But the process is basically the same. In its application lies one of
the greatest managerial opportunities for making work productive.</p>
<p>The most conspicuous area in which we need to organize as systematic
work the ap- plication and acquisition of already existing knowledge is
perhaps the development work in industry, i.e., the work of converting
new knowledge into marketable products or mar- ketable services. The
knowledge is already there as a result of research or invention. What is
needed now is to apply what we already know. This, by and large, is not
yet done sys- tematically. Where, however, development work has been
organized on the methodology of work (and again, primarily as flexible
mass production), as in some pharmaceutical companies, the results have
been impressive, in the speed of the work, in its productivity, and in
the economic success of the developed product or service.</p>
<p>The one area in which it is not yet proven that the systematic
methodology of work applies is the generation of new knowledge, whether
invention or research. There is, how- ever, considerable reason to
believe that the same methodology should apply at least to substantial
parts of the activity.</p>
<p>Edison, perhaps the most productive inventor of the nineteenth
century, applied a sys- tematic method to make inventing work
productive. He always started out with a clear definition of the product
desired. He then broke down the process into constituent parts and
worked out their relationship and sequence. He set specific controls for
key points. He laid down the standards, and so on. To be sure, Edison
did not take out the “creative spark.” But he tried, and successfully,
to give creativity a solid foundation in system and method. One
indication that he may have been on the right path is the large number
of his assistants who became successful inventors in their own right,
though clearly devoid of</p>
<p>outstanding creativity—e.g., Frank J. Sprague (1857-1934), who was by
all accounts a mere plodder but whose inventions were largely
responsible for the electric streetcar.</p>
<p>But so far, we have only a few isolated examples—enough to indicate
potential but not enough for proof. Clearly, there are limits to
methodology—the artist’s vision lies well outside its scope (though the
artist’s work does not). But research, that is, the organ- ized search
for new scientific or industrial knowledge, falls in all probability
well within these limitations.</p>

<p>S</p>
<p>ince the writings of the human-relations school first came to the
notice of managers around World War II, there has been a proliferation
of books, papers, and studies on motivation and achievement, on
industrial psychology and industrial sociology, on interpersonal
relations at work and on worker satisfaction. Indeed, the literature on
man- aging worker and working, in quantity at least, exceeds the
literature in any other man- agement field, including even the
management sciences and the computer.</p>
<p>The most widely read and most often quoted of these books is probably
Douglas McGregor’s The Human Side of Enterprise,* with its Theory X and
Theory Y. McGregor conducted no original research. He acknowledged
freely in his book that he had devel- oped no new ideas but had
formulated the ideas of others (and especially those I had put forth in
three earlier books†). But his book fully deserves the wide attention it
has re- ceived. McGregor powerfully presented fundamental choices for
managing worker and working. His Theory X—the traditional approach to
worker and working—assumes that people are lazy, dislike and shun work,
have to be driven and need both carrot and stick. It assumes that most
people are incapable of taking responsibility for themselves and have to
be looked after. By contrast, Theory Y assumes that people have a
psychological need to work and want achievement and responsibility.
Theory X assumes immaturity. Theory Y assumes fundamentally that people
want to be adults.</p>
<p>McGregor presented these two theories as alternatives and pretended
to impartiality.</p>
<p>Yet no reader ever doubted—or was meant to doubt—that McGregor
himself believed wholeheartedly in Theory Y.</p>
<p>There is impressive evidence for Theory Y. On most jobs most workers,
even those hostile to boss and organization, want to like their work and
look for achievement. In most jobs even the most alienated workers
manage to find something that gives them sat- isfaction.</p>
<p>This was first brought out in the late 1940s, when General Motors
conducted a large- scale contest on “My Job and Why I Like It” (of which
unfortunately few results have been published). Almost 190,000 workers
wrote in and discussed their jobs—by far the largest sample of worker
attitudes we have ever obtained. Very few were uncritical. But</p>
<p>*McGraw-Hill, 1960.</p>
<p>†Concept of the Corporation, The New Society, and The Practice of
Management.</p>
<p>even fewer did not find something that made them like the job, did
not mention some challenge in it, some achievement and satisfaction,
some true motivation.</p>
<p>Equally convincing are the extensive studies of Frederick Herzberg on
knowledge workers (already mentioned in Chapter 16). Herzberg produced
example after example that knowledge workers want achievement and will
indeed work only if there is achieve- ment in their job. Otherwise they
will at best go through the motions.</p>
<p>The most moving statement of Theory Y antedates behavioral science by
thousands of years. It is the funeral oration for the fallen Athenians
which Thucydides has Pericles de- liver in his great history of the
Peloponnesian War. What Pericles said, in effect, was that Athens was a
Theory Y society as against the Spartans, who were probably the world’s
most consistent practitioners of Theory X.</p>
<p>Yet things are far less simple than McGregor’s followers would make
us—and them- selves—believe. In the first place, we have learned that
Theory Y is not by itself ade- quate. When I first propounded what
McGregor later formulated and popularized as The- ory Y, I laid great
stress on the fact that this was not “permissive.” On the contrary, I
said that to manage worker and working by putting responsibility on the
worker and by aiming at achievement made exceedingly high demands on
both worker and manager. McGregor also saw this, though he did not
stress it.*</p>
<p>Maslow’s Criticism</p>
<p>An ardent enthusiast for Theory Y, the late Abraham H. Maslow,
pointed out that the de- mands are actually much higher than even I had
seen. Maslow spent one year working closely with a small company in
Southern California which at the time tried to practice Theory Y. In the
book he wrote on his experience,† Maslow pointed out that the demand for
responsibility and achievement may well go far beyond what any but the
strong and healthy can take. He sharply criticized me and McGregor for
“inhumanity” to the weak, the vulnerable, the damaged, who are unable to
take on the responsibility and self- discipline which Theory Y demands.
Even the strong and healthy, Maslow concluded, need the security of
order and direction; and the weak need protection against the burden of
responsibility. The world is not, Maslow concluded, peopled by adults.
It has its full share of the permanently immature.</p>
<p>Of course, Maslow only paraphrased Dostoyevsky’s famous legend of the
Grand In- quisitor in The Brothers Karamazov. Unlike Dostoyevsky’s Grand
Inquisitor, Maslow, however, did not conclude that paternalist
oppression is the only way to manage and, in fact, the only kindness to
man. His conclusion was far more important and far more valid.
Maslow—who, until his death a few years later, remained a strong
advocate of Theory Y—concluded that it is not enough to remove
restraints. One has to replace the security of Theory X and the
certainty it gives by another but different structure of security and
cer- tainty. There is need to provide by different means what commands
and penalties do un- der Theory X. Theory Y, in other words, has to go
far beyond Theory X. It cannot simply be substituted for it.</p>
<p>This is an important insight. And it is clearly proven by all our
experience with The- ory Y.</p>
<p>In fact, while Maslow wrote Eupsychian Management, one of McGregor’s
closest friends and disciples proved Maslow’s point. Warren Bennis,
himself a distinguished in- dustrial psychologist (and the editor of
McGregor’s posthumous book, The Professional Manager, mentioned above),
attempted in the late sixties to convert the University of Buffalo, in
upstate New York, from an old, tired, and rundown school into a major,
first- rate university. His approach and that of his colleagues was
clearly based on Theory Y— but without giving structure, direction, and
security. The result was tremendous excite- ment but also total failure.
Instead of achievement, there was lack of direction, lack of</p>
<p>*An oversight repaired in his posthumous The Professional Manager
(McGraw-Hill, 1967). †Eupsychian Management (Irwin, 1965).</p>
<p>objectives, lack of controls, and frustration—as Bennis (who later
became president of the University of Cincinnati) himself recounts.</p>
<p>One conclusion from Maslow’s work is that Theory Y is not permissive,
as so many of its advocates believe. It is not freedom from restraint.
It is not, as its critics contend, in- dulging the worker, let alone
coddling him. It is a stern taskmaster, sterner in many ways than the
Theory X—which it replaces. It has to achieve what Theory X achieved,
and then do a good deal more—or else it will prove too great a burden
and will make demands human beings cannot meet.</p>
<p>It has now become clear that Theory X and Theory Y are not, as
McGregor main- tained, theories about human nature (a position never
shared by me, by the way). Whether we will ever know enough about human
nature to have any theories about it re- mains to be seen. But so far,
the evidence is not at all conclusive.</p>
<p>Everybody knows that there are undoubtedly lazy people as there are
undoubtedly en- ergetic ones. Far more important, however, is that
ordinary, everyday experience teaches us that the same people react
quite differently to different circumstances. They may be lazy and
resist work to the point of sabotaging it in one situation. They may be
motivated to achievement in another one. It is clearly not human nature
nor personality structure that is at issue. Or at the very least, there
are different human natures which behave differently under different
conditions.</p>
<p>Modern American slang talks of being “turned on” or “turned off” by
an assignment, a teacher, a job, or a boss. These terms have been
criticized as dehumanizing. They refer to people, it is being said, as
if they were electrical appliances. But everyday experience shows that
this is exactly how a great many people behave. They react rather than
act. The motivation, the drive, the impulse lie outside of them.</p>
<p>But this is not compatible with either Theory X or Theory Y. It
implies that it is not human nature but the structure of job and work
that, in effect, determines how people will act and what management they
will require.</p>
<p>We also now know that individuals can acquire the habit of
achievement but can also acquire the habit of defeat. This again is not
compatible with either the Theory X or the Theory Y of human nature.</p>
<p>The best-known work in this area has been done by David C. McClelland
at Harvard.* McClelland has taken the position that the desire to
achieve is conditioned largely by cul- ture and by experiences, both of
which can be changed even in a non-achieving culture such as that of the
Indian caste system. The most extensive study of actual worker behav-
ior in large-scale industry, the work which the Canadian-born English
psychiatrist Elliott Jaques† conducted for many years at the Glacier
Metal Company in London (together with the company’s chief executive,
Wilfred Brown), supports the same conclusion.</p>
<p>What Is the Manager’s Reality?</p>
<p>The debate over the scientific validity of Theory X versus Theory Y
is, therefore, largely a sham battle. The question the manager needs to
ask is not “Which theory of human na- ture is right?” The question is
“What is the reality of my situation and how can I discharge my task of
managing worker and working in today’s situation?”</p>
<p>The basic fact—unpalatable but inescapable—is that the traditional
Theory X ap- proach to managing, that is, the carrot-and-stick way, no
longer works. In developed countries, it does not even work for manual
workers, and nowhere can it work for knowl- edge workers. The stick is
no longer available to the manager, and the carrot is today be- coming
less and less of an incentive.</p>
<p>The stick of the traditional approach to managing worker and working
was hunger and fear. Traditionally, all but a handful of men in every
society lived at the very margin of subsistence and in imminent threat
of starvation. One bad harvest was enough to force an</p>
<p>*See his book, Motivating Economic Achievement (Free Press,
1969).</p>
<p>†See his books, Changing Culture of the Factory (Dryden Press, 1952),
and Equitable Payment; a General Theory of Work; Differential Payment
and Individual Progress (Wiley, 1961).</p>
<p>Indian or Chinese peasant to sell his daughters into prostitution.
One bad harvest was enough for him to lose the tiny plot of land which
was all that stood between him and beggary. Now, even in only moderately
affluent countries, there is an economic floor well above subsistence
level, even for the very poor. The worker knows today, in every devel-
oped country, that he and his family will not starve if he loses his
job. He may have to do without a lot of things he would like to have,
but he can survive.</p>
<p>Marx’s Lumpenproletariat, that is, the unemployables, still exist
even in some very rich countries. But Marx’s proletariat has
disappeared—and with it the stick of Theory X.</p>
<p>Even where fear exists, it has largely ceased to motivate. Instead of
motivation, fear is becoming a demotivator. One reason for this is the
spread of education, the other reason is the emergence of the society of
organization. The spread of education makes people employable. It gives
them a wider horizon. Even poorly educated people in today’s soci- ety
now know of opportunities. In a society of organizations it is possible
to gain access to a new job. In a society of organizations there is
lateral mobility. Losing one’s job is still unpleasant. But it is no
longer catastrophe.</p>
<p>The English tenant farmer, no matter how accomplished or industrious,
who was evicted by his landlord became a “sturdy beggar.” There was no
other employment for him, except an occasional day of work as a casual
laborer helping out with the harvest. Losing one’s job was more than a
life sentence; it usually condemned a man’s children and his
grandchildren. It made a man an outcast. Now the man who loses his job
registers with the employment exchange for another one. Even at the
depth of a serious recession today—e.g., the American recession of
1970-1971—there were hardly any long-term un- employed adult male
workers.</p>
<p>In addition, there is rising employment security which protects a man
in his job. It takes many forms. In Sweden a three-partite board
guarantees a man another job and pro- vides for his training and support
between jobs (see Chapter 22). In most European (and Latin American)
countries, there are legal restrictions on firing. There are seniority
provi- sions which make job security into a right. In the United States,
increasingly, income, if not employment, is maintained for long periods
through such contractual provisions as supplemental unemployment
compensation.</p>
<p>All developed countries are moving toward the system of the modern
university, where a faculty member after a few years of service acquires
tenure, which all but com- pletely commits his employer to a job for
him. At the same time, the faculty member has almost unlimited mobility
and can freely move from one university position to another.</p>
<p>Japan has lifetime employment, which binds both employer and worker.
Fear of being fired, therefore, does not exist in Japan, at least not in
the “modern” sector. This (as the next chapter will discuss) is a major
factor in Japan’s economic achievement.</p>
<p>The Japanese example also shows that the more fear disappears as a
stick, the more counterproductive remnants of fear become. The Japanese
worker knows that he is tied to an employer and is unlikely to find
other employment if he loses his present job. This makes him dedicated
to the welfare of the organization that employs him. But it also makes
him resent bitterly any structural change in the economy that might
threaten the industry or occupation that employs him—the reason, for
instance, for the extremely bad labor relations on the Japanese National
Railroads. The Japanese worker’s inability to move also makes him
defenseless against the pressure to conform exerted by the organi-
zation. This is increasingly unacceptable to the young educated people.
Indeed, while still expecting the security of lifetime employment, they
increasingly demand for themselves the right to move to another
employer. Rousseau pointed out two hundred years ago that the “right to
emigrate” is the ultimate safeguard of personal liberty.</p>
<p>Japan, it is reasonable to predict, will move toward a system under
which the worker has guarantees of income and job, but also
mobility.</p>
<p>Modern behavioral psychology has demonstrated that great fear
coerces, while rem- nants of fear cause only resentment and resistance.
Fear in all developed countries has lost its coercive power. The lesser
fears that still remain do not motivate. They destroy moti-
vation—precisely because they lack full power and full credibility.</p>
<p>“Big Fear” and “Little Fears”</p>
<p>The “big fear” still motivates where it is truly credible, as is
shown by the quite unex- pected success which a new approach to “curing”
alcoholism has had. Everybody has “known” that the true alcoholic cannot
stop drinking until he is completely down and out, if then. But a good
many employers are now finding that a very large percentage of alco-
holic workers do indeed stop drinking—permanently—if told in unequivocal
language that they will otherwise be fired and that potential new
employers will be told of their problem, so that they are unlikely to
find another job.</p>
<p>But, save in such exceptional cases as the alcoholic who knows that
he is rapidly be- coming unemployable, the big stick, the horrible fear
which drove workers yesterday, is no longer available to today’s manager
in the developed countries, whether the manager likes it or not. It is
extremely foolish to try to depend on “little sticks,” that is, whatever
remnants of fear are still available. To be sure, any organization needs
disciplinary de- vices, but their role and purpose is to take care of
marginal friction. They cannot provide the drive. If misused to drive,
disciplinary devices can cause only resentment and resis- tance. They
can only demotivate.</p>
<p>The Overly Potent Carrot</p>
<p>The carrot of material rewards has not, like the stick of fear, lost
its potency. On the con- trary, it has become so potent that it must be
used with great caution. It has become too potent to be a dependable
tool.</p>
<p>The Sunday issue of every newspaper these days contains an article by
a learned soci- ologist or philosopher reporting that people are turning
away from material satisfactions. On the front page of the same paper,
Sundays and weekdays, there is then always a story that this or that
group of workers—teachers or electricians, newspaper reporters or fire-
men, salesclerks or stevedores—have presented the biggest wage demand
ever or have obtained the biggest wage raise ever.</p>
<p>When the youthful rebels against material civilization half a century
ago went back to nature, all they needed was a tent or a sleeping bag.
These days, turning one’s back on material civilization seems to require
an ,000 camper-truck. The youthful rebels of the 1920s played their
back-to-nature songs on a ukulele; today we need an electronic guitar to
express our rejection of technology. The same European intellectuals who
so vocally inveigh against American materialism use the fees they get
for their lectures and articles for such nonmaterial satisfactions as a
sports car, an airplane trip to a plush resort, or the purchase of a
villa on a Mediterranean beach.</p>
<p>There is not one shred of evidence for the alleged turning away from
material rewards.</p>
<p>On the contrary, affluence means that everybody believes that
material rewards are and should be within his easy reach. Samuel
Gompers, the long-time head of the American labor movement, used to
define the aims of a labor union in one word: “more.” He would surely
have to change this today to “much more.” Anti-materialism is a myth, no
matter how much it is extolled. So far, at least, the reality is
tremendous and steadily rising mate- rial expectations, i.e.,
expectations for more goods and services.</p>
<p>This is not confined to the capitalist world. It has become the
massive reality of com- munist societies as well. In the thirties Stalin
did not hesitate to cut back drastically on the people’s diet when
Russia had a bad harvest. His successors, in 1972, faced by a much less
poor harvest, instead dipped deeply into Russia’s strategic gold
reserves to buy grain from the archenemy, the United States. Mao, in the
years of the Great Cultural Revolution in the sixties, thundered against
“economism,” i.e., against material incentives and re- wards. By the
early seventies the emphasis in China had shifted to heavy stress on
such capitalist incentives as bicycles and sewing machines as rewards
for performance.</p>
<p>The demand for much more is obviously going to run ultimately into
the finite limita- tions of the earth’s resources and the need to
preserve the environment. What we experi- ence today may therefore
indeed be the final frenzied agony of the “material civilization.” But,
at least for the foreseeable future, this will mean above all an even
faster shift from</p>
<p>goods to services as carriers of satisfaction, and with it, from
material-intensive to labor- intensive (and especially
knowledge-labor-intensive) wants and purchases. It is most unlikely, for
the foreseeable future, to alter the basic characteristics. On the
contrary; that rising raw-material prices and ecology costs will push up
the cost of goods is almost cer- tain to add fuel to the fire of demands
for more, much more, monetary rewards.</p>
<p>It is precisely the rising level of material expectations that makes
the carrot of material rewards less and less effective as a motivating
force and as a managerial tool.</p>
<p>The increment of material rewards capable of motivating people to
work has to be- come larger. As people get more they do not become
satisfied with a little more, let alone with less. They expect much
more. This is, of course, one of the major causes of the re- lentless
inflationary pressures that besiege every major economy today. Whereas a
5 per- cent wage boost was, a short few years ago, a major satisfaction,
the teamsters—or the teachers or the physicians—now demand 40 percent
and expect 20 percent.</p>
<p>This may be a manifestation of Maslow’s rule that the closer a need
comes to being satisfied, the larger an increment of additional
gratification will be required to produce the same satisfaction. But the
demand for more and much more of material satisfactions has also been
accompanied by a change in values that does not fit Maslow’s scheme at
all. Economic incentives are becoming rights rather than rewards. Merit
raises are always introduced as rewards for exceptional performance. In
no time at all they become a right. To deny a merit raise or to grant
only a small one becomes punishment. The same is true of Japan’s
semiannual bonus.</p>
<p>But whatever the explanation, the result of the increasing demand for
material rewards is rapidly destroying their usefulness as incentives
and managerial tools. The manager must try to deemphasize the role of
material rewards rather than use them as a carrot. If only very
large—and steadily larger—increments have an incentive effect, then
using material incentives becomes self-defeating. The expected result in
terms of motivation will be obtained, but the cost will be so high as to
exceed the benefits. The cost will eat up the additional productivity.
This is, of course, what has been happening with respect to material
incentives for managers (e.g., stock option or extra compensation plans)
as well as with respect to material incentives for all other classes of
workers.</p>
<p>That inflation has become the central problem of the developed
economies is, in terms of traditional or Keynesian economic theory, pure
paradox. Inflation should not occur under conditions of high productive
capacity and high productivity. Instead it is the norm. The reason is
the totally unexpected size of economic appetites, the totally
unexpected potency of material rewards. The result, however, is that to
enable economy, society and enterprise to survive, managers must try to
curb and to contain economic incentives rather than rely on them. The
economic incentive that has a true carrot effect is “too much.” Only
economic rewards that fall well below the threshold of motivational
effectiveness are likely to be defensible economically and in terms of
productivity and contribution.</p>
<p>This also means that the social side effects of the carrot are
reaching toxic propor- tions. A potent medicine always has side effects;
and the larger the dosage, the greater the side effects. Material
incentives and rewards is a very strong medicine indeed, and be- coming
more potent. It therefore is bound to have potent side effects, which
become more pronounced and more dangerous as the dosage required for
effectiveness increases. In particular (as said before in Chapter 16)
the more total income goes up, the more power- ful does dissatisfaction
over relative compensation become. As all our studies show— beginning
with the GM contest “My Job” in the late forties—there is no more
powerful disincentive, no more effective bar to motivation, than
dissatisfaction over one’s own pay compared to that of one’s peers. Once
people’s incomes rise above the subsistence level, dissatisfaction with
relative incomes is a far more powerful sentiment than dissatisfaction
with one’s absolute income. The “sense of injustice,” as Edmond Cahn,
the American legal philosopher, convincingly argued, is deeply ingrained
in man. Nothing is as likely to offend the sense of injustice as
dissatisfaction with relative economic rewards in an or- ganization. An
organization is a redistributive economy (see Chapter 16); relative
eco-</p>
<p>nomic rewards are therefore power and status decisions on the worth
of a person or a group.</p>
<p>Reliance on the carrot of economic rewards therefore runs the risk of
alienating both the recipient and all others. It runs the risk of
dividing the group against itself while unit- ing it against the system,
i.e., against the employing institution and its management.</p>
<p>Clearly no de-emphasis of material rewards is likely. Managers face
instead the tre- mendous challenge of finding some means to relate the
growing emphasis on “much more” to economic reality, i.e., to
productivity and profitability. Material rewards are too potent to be
relied on as the main positive motivator. This can only mean growing
infla- tionary pressures and growing dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>This applies to managers as well as to blue-collar workers. There is
little doubt that managerial carrots have grown into seven-course
Victorian meals, e.g., from small bo- nuses to massive stock option
plans. (This also raises serious problems of social responsi- bility,
which will be discussed in Chapter 28.) With respect to managerial
incentives, we are moving from more to much more. At the same time there
is growing evidence that inequalities in managerial incentives—real or
fancied—are more demotivating than the rewards themselves satisfy and
motivate.</p>
<p>The limitations of the effectiveness of carrot and stick apply with
particular force to two groups in the work force: the new breed of
manual workers and knowledge workers.</p>
<p>In managing manual workers, the manager in the developed country more
and more has to deal with men (and to a lesser extent with women) who
(as said in Chapter 15) start out as “losers,” feel rejected, feel
already defeated. These are people who have been driven all their lives
and yet have not achieved. But losers always learn one thing, and that
to perfection: resistance against being driven. They may not be able to
achieve, but they know how to sabotage.</p>
<p>The best text on this is not a learned study by a professor of
psychology but a best- selling humorous novel of the twenties, The Good
Soldier Schweik, by the Czech writer Jaroslav Hasek. Schweik, one of the
world’s defeated, the archetypal dropout, single- handedly stultifies
and frustrates the whole Theory X apparatus of the mighty army of a
great power, pre-World War I Austria-Hungary. He does nothing overt. He
knows how to sabotage.</p>
<p>To drive the new breed of manual workers therefore will not be
successful. Hunger and fear no longer dominate them as they did their
grandparents. But their very failure has made them impervious to
pressures.</p>
<p>The knowledge worker will not produce if managed under Theory X.
Knowledge has to be self-directed and has to take responsibility.</p>
<p>Fear is altogether incompatible with the production of knowledge. It
may produce ef- forts and anxieties. It will not produce results. And
fear inhibits learning, a basic finding of modern behavioral psychology.
Rewards and reaffirmation will produce learning. In anything that has to
do with knowledge, fear will produce only resistance.</p>
<p>Theory X assumes a “master.” But in a society of organizations there
are no masters.</p>
<p>The manager is not a master. He is a superior, but he is a fellow
employee. For the first time in history there is a society which lacks
masters.</p>
<p>This is not the case in communist societies, which have assiduously
worked at replac- ing the old masters with new masters. The role of the
communist party in a communist state is to be a master. It is in crisis
precisely because even under communism a modern society becomes a
society of organizations and as such requires managers and cannot tol-
erate masters.</p>
<p>The manager, not being a master, lacks both the master’s authority
and the master’s credibility. The master’s power is independent of the
support he receives, either from his servants or from society around
him. One can kill a master, but one cannot oust him. But, as the sixties
amply showed, e.g., in the case of countless university presidents, even
the chief executive of an organization can be ousted, precisely because
he is a fallow em- ployee. The authority he exercises is not his own,
and cannot survive a challenge.</p>
<p>In terms of the ancient law of master and servant, the chief
executive officer of the largest corporation is a fellow servant. Others
may be subordinate in rank, but they are equal in law. They are not the
chief executive’s servants, they are his fellow workers.</p>
<p>This is much more than a semantic shift. It means that neither stick
nor carrot will ac- tually work if used by a manager, no matter how well
they used to work for the master of old.</p>
<p>Can We Replace Carrot and Stick?</p>
<p>Can we replace the carrot of monetary rewards and the stick of fear
with a new carrot and a new stick appropriate to the new managerial
reality?</p>
<p>After all, carrot and stick have worked for an amazingly long time.
One does not lightly toss out the tradition of the ages. Over the
millennia during which working and worker have been managed, society has
changed fundamentally. Yet managing worker and working has shown amazing
continuity. The same Theory X principles that were ap- plied to managing
worker and working in the building of the great pyramids of Egypt still
inform the organization of worker and working in the modern
mass-production plant.</p>
<p>Henry Ford’s best-known epigram is “History is bunk.” Ford was a bold
innovator in organizing work, in marketing, and in economics, but when
it came to managing worker and working he was completely the prisoner of
history and a traditionalist.</p>
<p>The traditional way of managing working and worker cuts across all of
man’s cultures.</p>
<p>There is no great difference between West and East, between pagan
antiquity and Chris- tendom, between China and the Occident, between
Inca Peru and Mogul India. Nor does the organization of society itself
seem to make much difference.</p>
<p>In that respect the Marxist analysis has altogether failed. The
factory and office in So- viet Russia or in the Soviet satellites in
Europe are organized no differently from the wicked capitalist West.
Nor, all evidence clearly shows, is the worker any more achieving or the
bosses any less the bosses. The same applies to the far more imaginative
Yugoslav experiment of direct worker control of individual businesses,
to direct worker ownership, to ownership by a cooperative, and so
on.</p>
<p>We therefore know Theory X management. What to put in its place is—or
so it seems—largely guesswork and speculation. Surely it would be the
better part of wisdom to try to maintain the essence of Theory X by
substituting “modern” drives for the old driving force of fear and
money. What we need, one might argue, is to find the organiza- tional
equivalent to the gasoline engine which replaced the horse—but to keep
the wheeled vehicle.</p>
<p>Not only managers ask this question. The labor unions are perhaps
even more eager to keep the Theory X structure. The unions, after all,
have a stake in the coercive relation- ship between master and servant
of Theory X; if there were no master, what, indeed, would the union’s
role be? Also labor leaders derive their pride and sense of mission from
opposition to Theory X, know how to behave under it, and have its
rhetoric down pat.</p>
<p>When the younger workers in some General Motors plants began to talk
about human- izing the assembly line, the greatest resistance did not
come from General Motors man- agement. It came from the United
Automobile Workers’ leadership, which insisted on talking about money,
pensions, hours off, coffee breaks—and so on. The UAW Ieaders, in other
words, insisted, against their own members, on maintaining and even
strengthen- ing a Theory X management on the part of the company.</p>
<p>To look for a new set of drives to take the place of the old carrot
and stick seems not only rational but tempting. Such replacement drives
are indeed being offered managers in the form of a new “enlightened
psychological despotism.”</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of the recent writers on industrial psychology
profess allegiance to Theory Y. They use terms like “self-fulfillment,”
“creativity,” and “the whole man.” But what they talk and write about is
control through psychological manipulation. They are led to this by
their basic assumptions, which are precisely the Theory X assumptions:
man is weak, sick, and incapable of looking after himself. He is full of
fears, anxieties, neuro-</p>
<p>ses, inhibitions. Essentially he does not want to achieve but wants
to fail. He therefore wants to be controlled. Indeed, for his own good
he needs to be controlled—not by fear of hunger and incentive of
material rewards but through his fear of psychological alienation and
the incentive of “psychological security.”</p>
<p>I know that I am oversimplifying. I know that I am lumping under one
heading half a dozen different approaches. But they all share the same
basic assumptions, those of The- ory X, and they all lead to the same
conclusions. Psychological control by the superior, the manager, is
possible; and psychological control by the superior, the manager, is
“un- selfish” and in the worker’s own interest. By becoming his workers’
psychological ser- vant, however, the manager retains control as their
“boss.”</p>
<p>This is “enlightened” whereas the old carrot-and-stick approach may
be condemned as crassly coercive (and is condemned as such by the
psychologists). But it is despotism nonetheless. Under this new
psychological dispensation, persuasion replaces command. Those
unconvinced by persuasion would presumably be deemed sick, immature, or
in need of psychotherapy to become adjusted. Psychological manipulation
replaces the car- rot of financial rewards; and empathy, i.e., the
exploitation of individual fears, anxieties, and personality needs,
replaces the old fear of being punished or of losing one’s job.</p>
<p>This is strikingly similar to the eighteenth-century philosopher’s
theory of the enlight- ened despot. As in modern organization today,
affluence and education—in this case, the affluence and rising education
of the middle class—threatened to deprive the sovereign of his carrot
and stick. The philosopher’s enlightened despot was going to maintain
absolut- ism by replacing the old means with persuasion, reason, and
enlightenment—all in the interest of the subjects, of course.</p>
<p>Psychological despotism, whether enlightened or not, is gross misuse
of psychology.</p>
<p>The main purpose of psychology is to acquire insight into, and
mastery of, oneself. Not for nothing were what we now call the
behavioral sciences originally called the moral sciences and “Know
thyself” their main precept. To use psychology to control, dominate, and
manipulate others is self-destructive abuse of knowledge. It is also a
particularly re- pugnant form of tyranny. The master of old was content
to control the slave’s body.</p>
<p>We are concerned, however, here neither with the proper use of
psychology nor with morality. But can the Theory X structure be
maintained through psychological despotism? Can psychological despotism
work?</p>
<p>Psychological despotism should have tremendous attraction for
managers. It promises them that they can continue to behave as they have
always done. All they need is to ac- quire a new vocabulary. It flatters
them. And yet managers, while avidly reading the psy- chology books and
attending psychological workshops, are shying away from trying the new
psychological Theory X.</p>
<p>Managers show sound instincts in being leery. Psychological despotism
cannot work any more than enlightened despotism worked in the political
sphere two hundred years ago—and for the same reason. It requires
universal genius on the part of the ruler. The manager, if one listens
to the psychologists, will have to have insight into all kinds of
people. He will have to be in command of all kinds of psychological
techniques. He will have to have empathy for all his subordinates. He
will have to understand an infinity of individual personality
structures, individual psychological needs, and individual psycho-
logical problems. He will, in other words, have to be omniscient. But
most managers find it hard enough to know all they need to know about
their own immediate area of exper- tise, be it heat-treating or cost
accounting or scheduling.</p>
<p>And to expect any large number of people to have “charisma”—whatever
the term might mean—is an absurdity. This particular quality is reserved
for the very few.</p>
<p>Managers should indeed know more about human beings. They should at
least know that human beings behave like human beings, and what that
implies. Above all, like most of us, managers need to know much more
about themselves than they do; for most man- agers are action-focused
rather than introspective. And yet, any manager, no matter how many
psychology seminars he has attended, who attempts to put psychological
despotism</p>
<p>into practice will very rapidly become its first casualty. He will
immediately blunder. He will impair performance.</p>
<p>The work relationship has to be based on mutual respect.
Psychological despotism is basically contemptuous—far more contemptuous
than the traditional Theory X. It does not assume that people are lazy
and resist work, but it assumes that the manager is healthy while
everybody else is sick. It assumes that the manager is strong while
everybody else is weak. It assumes that the manager knows while
everybody else is ignorant. It assumes that the manager is right,
whereas everybody else is stupid. These are the assumptions of fool- ish
arrogance.</p>
<p>Above all, the manager-psychologist will undermine his own authority.
There is, to be sure, need for psychological insight, help, counsel.
There is need for the healer of souls and the comforter of the
afflicted. But the relationship of healer and patient and that of
superior to subordinate are different relationships and mutually
exclusive. They both have their own integrity. The integrity of the
healer is his subordination to the patient’s welfare. The integrity of
the manager is his subordination to the requirements of the common task.
In both relationships there is need for authority; but each has a
different ground of author- ity. A manager who pretends that the
personal needs of the subordinate for, e.g., affection, rather than the
objective needs of the task, determine what should be done, would not
only be a poor manager; no one would—or should—believe him. All he does
is to destroy the integrity of the relationship and with it the respect
for his person and his function.</p>
<p>Enlightened psychological despotism with its call for an unlimited
supply of universal geniuses for managerial positions and its confusion
between the healer’s and the man- ager’s authority and role is not going
to deliver what it promises: to maintain Theory X while pretending to
replace it.</p>
<p>But what then can work?</p>
<p>It is not simply McGregor’s Theory Y. The manager must indeed assume
with Theory Y that there are at least a substantial number of people in
the work force who want to achieve. Otherwise there is little hope.
Fortunately the evidence strongly supports this assumption. The manager
must further accept it as his job to make worker and working achieving.
He must be willing, as a result, to accept high demands on himself, his
serious- ness, and his competence. But the manager cannot assume, as
Theory Y does, that people will work to achieve if only they are given
the opportunity to do so. More is needed— much more—to make even the
strong and healthy accept the burden of responsibility. The structure we
need cannot depend on driving the worker; neither carrot nor stick is
de- pendable any more. But the structure must also provide substitutes
to the weak—and not only to them—for Theory X’s security of command and
of being looked after.</p>
<p>What would such an organization look like? And how would it work?
Fortunately we do not have to speculate. Some such organizations—though
certainly not examples of Theory Y—exist and can be examined.</p>

<p>I</p>
<p>n general, the history of working and worker is not a particularly
happy one. But there are significant exceptions. Again and again, we
find either a period or a particular or- ganization in which working is
achievement and fulfillment. The usual case is a great national
emergency, in which the worker sees himself contributing to a cause.
This hap- pened, for instance, in Great Britain in the months after
Dunkirk. On a smaller scale it occurred in the United States during
World War II. Jobs did not change. Bosses did not become more
intelligent or more humane. But the basic satisfaction of working
changed completely, if only for a limited period.</p>
<p>This can also be achieved, examples show, without great national
emergency, indeed, without any outside spur. Robert Owen made his
workers achieve in his Lanark textile mills in Scotland 150 years
ago—and he did not do anything revolutionary.</p>
<p>There are similar exceptions to be found in modern industry. The most
important—if only because of its success in worldwide economic
competition—is Japan’s organization of working and worker.</p>
<p>At first sight, nothing looks more like the extreme of Theory X than
a Japanese fac- tory or office. Japan is not a permissive country, but a
very rigid one. Its way of managing working and worker is anything but
flexible. But it differs significantly from any other way we know,
whether rigid or flexible, autocratic, or democratic. At the same time
its way is not hoary tradition. The most important features of the
Japanese system were de- veloped in the twenties and thirties of this
century and for use in modern large-scale or- ganization. The main
impetus was the importation of Taylor’s scientific management, which
began around 1920.</p>
<p>The industrial engineers in Japanese industry use the same methods,
tools, and tech- niques as the Westerner to study and to analyze work.
But the Japanese industrial engi- neer does not organize the worker’s
job. When he has reached the point at which he un- derstands the work,
he turns over the actual design of jobs to the work group itself. Actu-
ally, the industrial engineer begins to work with the people who have to
do the job long before he finishes his analysis. He will study the work
the same way his Western counter- part does. But he will, in his study,
constantly use the work force itself as his “resource.” When he has
finished his analysis, the synthesis will essentially be done by the
work group itself. The industrial engineer continues his, activities,
but he does so as “assistant” to the work group rather than as outside
analyst.</p>
<p>The Japanese worker very largely also takes responsibility for
improving his tools.</p>
<p>Machines in modern industry are, of course, designed by the engineer,
but when a new</p>
<p>machine or a new process is being introduced, the workers are
expected to take an active part in the final adjustment, the final
arrangement, the specific application of machine and tools. In many
businesses the work force actually participates in machine design and
acts as a resource to machine or process designer.</p>
<p>Zen versus Confucius</p>
<p>The mechanism for making the worker take responsibility for job and
tools is what the Japanese call “continuous training.” Every employee,
often up to and including top man- agers, keeps on training as a regular
part of his job until he retires. The weekly training session is a
regular and scheduled part of a man’s work. It is not run, as a rule, by
a trainer but by the men themselves and their supervisors. The technical
people, e.g., the industrial engineers, may attend but do not lead; they
are there to help, to inform, to advise—and to learn themselves.</p>
<p>The training session does not focus on any one skill. It is attended
by all men on a given job level and focuses on all the jobs within the
unit. The training session which the plant electrician attends will be
attended also by the machine operator in the same plant, by the man who
sets up and maintains the machines, and by the sweeper who pushes a
broom—and by all their supervisors. Its focus will be the working of the
plant rather than the job of this or that man.</p>
<p>Similarly, the accountant is expected to be trained—or to familiarize
himself in the training sessions of his office group, and through
correspondence courses, seminars, or continuation schools—in every
single one of the professional jobs needed in his company, such as
personnel, training, and purchasing.</p>
<p>The president of a fairly large company once told me casually that he
could not see me on a certain afternoon because he was attending his
company’s training session in weld- ing—and as a student, rather than as
an observer or teacher. This is unusual. But the com- pany president who
takes a correspondence course in computer programming is fairly common.
The young personnel man does so as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Underlying this is a very different concept of the purpose and nature
of learning from that prevailing in the West—but also in the China of
the Confucian tradition. The Confu- cian concept, which the West shares,
assumes that the purpose of learning is to qualify oneself for a new,
different, and bigger job. The nature of learning is expressed in a
learn- ing curve. Within a certain period of time this student reaches a
plateau of proficiency, where he then stays forever.</p>
<p>Japanese institutions are far mare rigidly departmentalized and
sectionalized than most Western institutions—though probably less
rigidly than the highly bureaucratic Soviet organization. Departments in
Japan fight fiercely for their territorial integrity. They have utmost
expertise in “empire building.” The individual member of a department is
ex- pected to be completely loyal to it, yet the individual employee
tends to see beyond the boundaries of his own specialty and his own
department. He knows what goes on. He knows the work of others, even
though he himself has never performed it. He sees a genu- ine whole, and
he is expected to be concerned with the performance of every single job
in</p>
<p>this genuine whole. He, therefore, can see his own place in the
structure and his own con- tribution.</p>
<p>Finally, continuous training creates receptivity for the new, the
different, the innova- tive, the more productive. The focus in the
training sessions is always on doing the job</p>
<p>better, doing it differently, doing it in new ways.</p>
<p>The training sessions actually generate pressure on the industrial
engineers. In the West, the industrial engineer starts out with the
assumption of resistance to his approach by the employee, whether in
manual or in clerical work. In Japan the industrial engineer tends to
complain that the employees expect and demand too much from him.</p>
<p>The commitment to continuous training makes the entire work force in
a Japanese in- stitution receptive to change and innovation rather than
resistant to it. At the same time, training mobilizes the experience and
knowledge of the employee for constructive im-</p>
<p>provement.</p>
<p>One basic problem in studies of employee satisfaction in the West has
always been that there are two kinds of dissatisfaction. There are
negative and positive dissatisfaction. There is the complaint about
frustration, arbitrariness, speed-up, poor pay, poor working
conditions—the negative dissatisfactions. There is also impatience with
poor working methods, desire to do a better job, demand for better, more
intelligent, more systematic management. The Japanese continuous
training mobilizes positive dissatisfaction and makes it productive.</p>
<p>Lifetime Employment</p>
<p>The Japanese system, as everybody knows, is different in its approach
to economics. Eve- ryone has heard that there is “lifetime employment”
in Japan. The majority of Japanese workers, at least in the modern
Japanese economy (i.e., the economic institutions that were started
after 1867 and in all other modern institutions such as government
agencies), are guaranteed a job once they have joined an employer. At
the same time, they cannot, as a rule, leave and go to work for somebody
else. Both employee and employer are tied to each other. This is
becoming less true. The labor shortage, especially among younger in-
dustrial workers, has led to a good deal of raiding. Highly trained
technical people— engineers, physicists, and chemists—have acquired
considerable mobility. But it is still true that the typical Japanese
large employer cannot usually dismiss or lay off an em- ployee, except
in extreme emergency.</p>
<p>As a result, the fear of losing one’s job for the ordinary economic
reasons, because of technological changes, or because of arbitrary
management action, is largely absent in Japan. There is a haunting fear
in the Japanese system, the fear of losing one’s member- ship in the
employing institution. In the Japanese tradition there is no place for
ronin, the masterless man. Nor, if only because of the seniority system
of wages, is it possible, as a rule, for a man to find a job except on
the entrance level, so that anyone who is unem- ployed past age thirty
is practically unemployable. This creates tremendous fear of the
consequences of personal misbehavior, i.e., tremendous pressure for
conformity. It also creates genuine fear lest the enterprise itself may
go under—which, in turn, then makes the Japanese willing to go to very
great lengths to maintain the competitive position of their employer,
whether the competitive position of a business in the market, or the
com- petitive position of a government agency in the continuous
infighting of Japanese politics.</p>
<p>The fear of dismissal or of being out of work are minimized in the
Japanese system. It has to operate without the stick of Theory X. It
also has to do without the carrot of eco- nomic rewards. Pay, except for
a tiny group of top managers—and then only after age forty-five or
so—has been tied to length of service for the last half century (and
again, mainly in modern institutions). In each, of the three categories
in which Japanese tradition divides the work force, if not all
humanity—manual worker, clerical worker, and man- ager—entrance pay is
the same for everybody in the company, and so is the entrance
age—respectively fifteen, eighteen, and twenty two. Progression in pay,
as well as pro-</p>
<p>gression in title, are then automatic—for manual and clerical worker
until retirement, for managers until age forty-five. Pay and title
depend on length of service.</p>
<p>But Flexible Labor Costs</p>
<p>The Japanese system, most Westerners would say; can work only as long
as pay levels are very low. The system, so it would appear to any
Westerner, must lead to totally inflexible and rigid labor costs. But
Japan actually has remarkable flexibility in labor costs.</p>
<p>One minor explanation of this is the existence of a temporary work
force, which can be laid off without any notice. Women are, almost by
definition, always considered tem- porary workers; very few married
women work in Japan, except on the farm and in small retail shops, i.e.,
in “pre-modern” work. In Japanese traditional businesses, such as the
old workshop industries producing lacquer, pottery, or silk, workers are
almost never perma- nent, but almost always temporary and paid often by
the hour. But the temporary work force is shrinking fast. In most modern
industries it is by now almost nonexistent except for women workers. Yet
labor costs are far from rigid. Only the flexibility of labor costs is
structured so as to be a minimum threat to the worker’s job and income
security.</p>
<p>Actually, most Japanese companies, especially the larger ones, can
and do lay off a larger proportion of their work force, when business
falls off, than most Western compa- nies are likely or able to do. Yet
they do so in such a fashion that the employees who need incomes the
most are fully protected. The burden of adjustment is taken by those who
can afford it and who have alternate incomes to fall back on.</p>
<p>What makes labor costs more flexible than they are in most countries
and industries of the West is the retirement system (or perhaps it
should be called the non-retirement sys- tem). This system harmonizes in
a highly ingenious fashion the worker’s need for job and income
guarantees with the economy’s need for flexible labor costs.</p>
<p>Official retirement in Japan is at age fifty-five—for everyone except
a few who at forty-five become members of top management and are not
expected to retire at any fixed age. At fifty-five, it is said, the
employee, whether he is a floor sweeper or a department head, retires.
Traditionally, he gets a severance bonus equal to about two years of
full pay. (Many companies, strongly backed by the government, are now
installing supplementary pension payments, but by Western standards
these payments are still exceedingly low.)</p>
<p>Considering that life expectancy in Japan is now fully up to Western
standards, so that most employees can expect to live to seventy or more,
this bonus seems wholly inade- quate. Yet one hears few complaints about
the dire fate of the pensioners. More amazing still, one encounters in
every Japanese factory, office, and bank, people who cheerfully admit to
being quite a bit older than fifty-five and who quite obviously are
still working. What is the explanation?</p>
<p>The rank-and-file blue-collar or white-collar employee ceases to be a
permanent em- ployee at age fifty-five and becomes a temporary worker.
This means that he can be laid off if there is not enough work. If there
is enough work—and, of course, there has been from 1950 on—he stays on,
very often doing the same work as before, side by side with the
permanent employee with whom he has been working for many years; but for
this work he now gets at least one-third less than he got when he was a
permanent employee.</p>
<p>The rationale is simple. As the Japanese see it, the man has
something to fall back on when he retires—the two-year pension. This,
they freely admit, is not enough to keep a man alive for fifteen years
or so. But it is usually enough to tide him over a bad spell. And since
he no longer has, as a rule, dependent children or parents whom he has
to support, his needs should be considerably lower than they were when
he was, say, forty and probably had both children and parents to look
after.</p>
<p>If my intent were to describe the Japanese employment system, I would
now have to go into a great many rather complicated details, such as the
role of the semiannual bonus. But I am concerned only with what we in
the West might learn from the Japanese. For us, the main interest of the
Japanese system, I submit, is the way in which it satisfies two ap-</p>
<p>parently mutually contradictory needs: (1) job and income security;
and (2) flexible, adaptable labor forces and labor costs.</p>
<p>In the West, during the last twenty-five years, more and more
employees have attained income maintenance that may often exceed what
the Japanese worker gets under life em- ployment. There is, for
instance, the supplementary unemployment benefit of the U.S.
mass-production industries which, in effect, guarantees the unionized
worker most of his income even during fairly lengthy layoffs. Indeed, it
may well be argued that labor costs in U.S. mass-production industries
are more rigid than they are in Japan, even though American managements
can rapidly adjust the number of men at work to the order flow, in
contrast to the Japanese practice of maintaining employment for
permanent employees almost regardless of business conditions.
Increasingly, also, we find in the heavily union- ized mass-production
industries provisions for early retirement, such as were written in the
fall of 1970 into the contract of the U.S. automobile industry.</p>
<p>Still, unionized employees in the West are laid off according to
seniority, with the ones with the least seniority going first. As a
result, we offer the least security of jobs and incomes to the men who
need predictable incomes the most—the fathers of young fami- lies (who
also may have older parents to support). Where there is early
retirement, it means, as a rule, that the worker has to make a decision
to retire permanently. Once he has opted for early retirement, he is out
of the work force and unlikely to be hired back by any employer. In
short, the U.S. labor force (and its counterparts in Europe) lacks the
feeling of economic and job security which is so pronounced a feature of
Japanese soci- ety.</p>
<p>The West pays for a high degree of income maintenance. We have
imposed on our- selves high rigidity with respect to labor costs, but we
get very few tangible benefits from these practices. Also, we do not get
the psychological security which is so prominent in Japanese
society—i.e., the deep conviction of a man of working age that he need
not worry about his job and his income. Instead we have fear. The
younger men fear that they will be laid off first, just when the
economic needs of their families are at their peak; the older men fear
that they will lose their jobs in their fifties, when they are too old
to be hired elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the Japanese system there is confidence in both age groups. The
younger men feel they can look forward to a secure job and steadily
rising income while their children are growing up; the older men feel
they are still wanted, still useful, and not a burden on soci- ety.</p>
<p>In practice, of course, the Japanese system is no more perfect than
any other system.</p>
<p>There are plenty of inequities in it. The young, especially the young
highly trained knowl- edge people, are grossly underpaid—to the point
where they have to postpone marriage and the start of a family until
they have eight to ten years of seniority. The young are, indeed, in
rebellion against the enforced subsidy to the older worker, which the
Japanese pay system exacts from them. Despite the outward deference paid
to age, the treatment of older people over fifty-five leaves much to be
desired. They are often ruthlessly exploited, especially in the small
workshop industries of “pre-industrial” Japan and in the multitude of
small service businesses. But the basic principle which the Japanese
have evolved—not by planning rationally, but by applying traditional
Japanese concepts of mutual obligation to employment and labor
economics—seems to make more sense and works better than the expensive
patchwork solutions we in the West have developed, which do not come to
grips with the problem itself. Economically, it might be said, we have
greater security in our system—we certainly pay more for it. Yet, we
have not obtained what the Japanese system produces, the psychological
conviction of job and income security.</p>
<p>To Each According to His Needs; the Benefit System</p>
<p>Western analysis of Japan focuses on money wages, if only because in
the West they have traditionally been the main, if not the sole, element
of labor cost. But in Japan, non-wage labor costs have, for many years,
if not for centuries, been at least as important as wages.</p>
<p>The importance of the fringes is rapidly diminishing in Japan as wage
incomes have been rising. Still, they are a larger part of the total
labor-cost bill than in Western or communist countries. In many
industries they still almost equal cash wages.</p>
<p>At first sight the Japanese benefit system is incomprehensible to an
outsider. There is no system. In one company there are housing
allowances; a second company builds work- ers’ housing; a third one does
nothing about housing. There are educational allowances in one company.
The next company runs a company school for women employees which teaches
the traditional accomplishments of the Japanese “lady,” i.e., flower
arrangement, the tea ceremony, dressmaking (and a little English
conversation). One company seems to take care of the widow and orphaned
children of a deceased employee, another company seems to pay no
attention to them.</p>
<p>Actually, there is a system: to shape benefits according to the need
of specific groups within the work force. If the company employs a large
number of young women, the great majority of whom will get married very
soon, pension benefits—or even a first-rate medi- cal plan—are of little
value. But learning the accomplishments of the married woman is of very
great value. If an employee dies and leaves a destitute widow with small
children, the company is expected to take responsibility. If the widow
is well off, or has a well-to-do brother, there is no need for the
company to concern itself, and accordingly, no obliga- tion.</p>
<p>The paternalism of the Japanese benefits system would not be
acceptable in the West nor would the absence of legally grounded rights
and obligations. In fact, it is question- able how long this will be
acceptable even in Japan. There is tremendous pressure, from public
opinion, from workers, from the government (but amazingly enough, not
from la- bor unions) to systematize the benefits system and to give the
employee predictable rights.</p>
<p>The basic concept, however, that benefits should be structured to the
needs of the em- ployee, particularly to the needs of specific groups
within the employees—e.g., young women workers or old male workers,
people with large families or unmarried or older couples whose children
have grown up—is fundamental to the Japanese approach to man- aging
worker and working.</p>
<p>The Godfather System</p>
<p>The house of Mitsui is the oldest of the world’s big businesses. It
dates back to 1637, half a century before the Bank of England was
founded. It also was the largest of the world’s big businesses until the
American occupation split it into individual companies. (As these
companies come back together into a fairly close confederation, Mitsui
may well again become the world’s biggest business.)</p>
<p>In the more than three hundred years of its business life, Mitsui has
never had a chief executive (the Japanese term is “chief
banto”—literally, chief clerk) who was not an out- standing man and a
powerful leader. This accomplishment is not matched by any other
institution, whether the Catholic Church, any government, army, navy,
university, or cor- poration.</p>
<p>What explains this amazing achievement? In Japan one always gets the
same answer: until recently, the chief banto—himself never a member of
the Mitsui family but a hired hand—had one main job: manager
development, manager selection, and manager place- ment. He spent a
great deal of time with the young people who came in as junior manag-
ers or professionals. He knew them. He listened to them. As a result, he
knew, by the time they had reached thirty or so, which ones were likely
to reach top management, what ex- periences and development they needed,
and in what job they should be tried and tested.</p>
<p>At first sight nothing would seem less likely to develop strong
executives than the Japanese system. It would seem, rather, to be the
ideal prescription for developing timid men selected for proven
mediocrity and trained not to rock the boat.</p>
<p>The young men who enter a Japanese company’s employ directly from the
univer- sity—and, by and large, this is the only way to get into a
company’s management, since</p>
<p>hiring from the outside and into upper-level positions is the rare
exception—know that they will have a job until they retire, no matter
how poorly they perform. Until they reach age forty-five, they will be
promoted and paid by seniority and by seniority alone.</p>
<p>There seems to be no performance appraisal, nor would there be much
point to it, when a man can be neither rewarded for performance nor
penalized for nonperformance. Superiors do not choose their
subordinates: the personnel people make personnel deci- sions as a rule,
often without consulting the manager to whom a subordinate is being as-
signed. It seems to be unthinkable for a young manager or professional
to ask for a trans- fer, and equally unthinkable for him to quit and go
elsewhere.</p>
<p>This process goes on for twenty to twenty-five years, during which
all the emphasis seems to be on conforming, on doing what one is being
asked to do, and on showing proper respect and deference.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, when a man reaches forty-five, the day of reckoning
arrives, when the goats are separated from the sheep. A very small group
is picked to become company directors—that is, top management. They can
stay in management well past any retire- ment age known in the West,
with active top-management people in their eighties by no means a
rarity. The rest of the group, from department director on down,
generally stay in management until they are fifty-five, usually with at
best one more promotion. Then they are retired—and, unlike the
rank-and-file employees, their retirement is compulsory.</p>
<p>Limited but important exceptions to this rule are made in the case of
outstanding men who, while too specialized to move into the top
management of the parent company, are assigned to the top management of
subsidiaries or affiliates. In such positions they can also stay in
office for an indefinite period of time.</p>
<p>To an outsider who believes what the Japanese tell him—namely, that
this is really the way the system works—it is hard to understand on what
basis the crucial decision at age forty-five is made. It is even harder
to believe that this system produces independent and aggressive top
managers who have marketed Japanese exports successfully all over the
world and who have, in the space of twenty years, made into the
second-ranking eco- nomic power in the world a nation that, at the eve
of World War II, was not even among the first dozen or so in industrial
production or capital.</p>
<p>It is precisely because Japanese managers have lifetime employment
and can, as a rule, be neither fired nor moved, and because advancement
for the first twenty-five years of a man’s working life is through
seniority alone that the Japanese have made the care and feeding of
their young people the first responsibility of top management.</p>
<p>The practice goes back almost four hundred years, when the samurai,
the retainers of a military clan, were organized into tight hereditary
castes with advancement from one to the other officially not permitted.
At the same time, the government of the clan had to find able people who
could run the clan’s affairs at a very early age and take their
opportuni- ties without offending higher ranking but less gifted clan
members.</p>
<p>Today, of course, it is no longer possible for the chief banto of
Mitsui to know per- sonally the young managerial people, as his
predecessor did a few generations ago. Even much smaller companies are
too large and have far too many young managerial and pro- fessional
employees in their ranks. Yet top management is still vitally concerned
with the young. It discharges this concern through an informal network
of senior middle- management people who act as “godfathers” to the young
men during the first ten years of their careers in the company.</p>
<p>The Japanese take this system for granted. Every young manager knows
who his god- father is, and so does his boss and the boss’s boss.</p>
<p>The godfather is rarely a young man’s direct superior; he may not
even be in the direct line of authority over the young man or his
department. He is rarely a member of top management and rarely a man who
will get into top management. He tends to be picked from members of
upper-middle management who will, when they reach fifty-five, be
transferred to the top management of a subsidiary or affiliate. In other
words, godfathers are people who know, having been passed over at age
forty-five for the top management spots, that they are not going to make
it in their own organization. Therefore, they are not</p>
<p>likely to build factions of their own or to play internal politics.
At the same time, they are the most highly respected members of the
middle-management group.</p>
<p>During the first ten years or so of a young man’s career, the
godfather is expected to be in close touch with his godchild, even
though in a large company he may have a hun- dred of them at any one
time. He is expected to know the young man, see him fairly regu- larly,
be available to him for advice and counsel, and, in general, look after
him.</p>
<p>If a young man gets stuck under an incompetent manager and needs to
be transferred, the godfather knows where to go and how to do what
officially cannot be done and, ac- cording to the Japanese, is never
done. Yet nobody will ever know about it. If the young man is naughty
and needs to be disciplined, the godfather will spank him in private. By
the time a young man is thirty, the godfather knows a great deal about
him, and so does top management.</p>
<p>The great weakness of all Japanese organizations is their tendency
toward the forma- tion of cliques—the Japanese word is habatsu. Personal
loyalty to a clique leader be- comes the first duty of a man. In turn,
belonging to the right clique becomes the one re- quirement of success.
The incompetent but loyal habatsu man finds himself rewarded, while the
most competent man who does not belong to the victorious habatsu may
find himself out in the cold. The godfather system can clearly become
the worst kind of clique—and sometimes does. Equally, it can easily
degenerate into the worst kind of pa- ternalism and into tremendous
pressure for conformity.</p>
<p>Still, the young knowledge worker in the Japanese organization is not
left orphaned.</p>
<p>Nor is he being neglected. He has somebody to go to with his
questions, his doubts, whether about himself or about his organization,
with his aspirations and expectations. In turn, there is somebody in the
company who cares for him, somebody who knows how the machinery works
and who can smooth the young man’s path, who can guide the young man’s
steps, but who can also administer, in complete privacy, very effective
discipline.</p>
<p>The manual worker and the clerical worker also have their godfathers.
For the manual worker, the role is being played by one of the
supervisors. He is, indeed, far less a super- visor than he is a
counselor if only because he has no weapons of enforcement. He cannot
dismiss a man. He cannot prevent his getting more pay when he acquires
the proper sen- iority. He cannot block a promotion.</p>
<p>By western standards there is little courtesy and less warmth to the
relationship be- tween supervisor and man in the Japanese organization.
There is not even much civility. Terms of personal abuse which would
bring about an immediate work stoppage in any unionized Western
plant—and would be unthinkable in most Western offices—are com- mon. In
this respect, Japan still follows the old tradition in which the teacher
of the young warrior or the great Zen master showed his concern for the
pupil by beating him. At the same time, the superior in Japan is
expected to concern himself with the needs, the expec- tations, the
aspirations, the questions of the younger man. And the seniority system
makes sure that the subordinate is always a younger man.</p>
<p>Upward Responsibility</p>
<p>The Japanese organization is infinitely more autocratic than anything
that can be found in the West, outside of the military. The deference
accorded the superior, beginning with the language used toward him, goes
far beyond the most deferential of Western traditions. And yet authority
from the top down is always matched by responsibility from the bottom
up.</p>
<p>This is the real meaning of the phrase “consensus decision.” It is
not true that the Japanese make decisions by consensus. This would
clearly result in the wrong decisions. Above all, it would inevitably
lead to compromise. If there is one thing that is typical of Japanese
decisions, it is that they are not compromises. The typical Japanese
decision is a radical departure—the system is so complex and cumbersome
that small decisions cannot be taken. (On this see Chapter 37.)</p>
<p>At every level of the organization, subordinates are expected to
participate in the re- sponsibility for the decision. They are expected
to think through what the decision is all about. They are expected to do
so by taking responsibility for the performance of the whole, for the
good of the organization, rather than for their own narrow parochial
point of view (though every Japanese will admit that this is hope rather
than reality).</p>
<p>There are limitations. The participants in the decision-making
process must always be members of one’s own group. In other words,
manual workers are not expected to con- cern themselves with a
managerial decision. Similarly, top management would not nor- mally
concern itself with the organization of work and jobs. This is for the
workers, for the supervisors, for the engineers in the plant.</p>
<p>Participation, however, is not in decision-making. It is in
“decision-thinking.” It is not in terms of Western constitutional theory
participation in authority. It is, however, genu- ine participation in
responsibility.</p>
<p>Though these Japanese practices are not “old Japan” but of very
recent origin and de- veloped since the 1920s, if not since the end of
World War II, they do, of course, reflect basic Japanese beliefs and
basic Japanese values. They cannot be transplanted into the cultural
soil of the West. But that the underlying approaches are not
specifically “Japa- nese” is proven by Western examples where similar
approaches have been used, and with equal effectiveness.</p>
<p>Ernst Abbé and the Zeiss Optical Works</p>
<p>In the economic rise of nineteenth-century Germany, the optical
industry played a key part. By 1890 Germany had a virtual world monopoly
on precision optics. While this mo- nopoly was broken by World War I,
Germany retained a dominant position until World War II. Precision
optics were principally the achievement of one firm, the Carl Zeiss
Works in Jena. Carl Zeiss (1816-1888), whose name the company still
bears, was himself a major innovator and inventor, but his greatest
contribution was his early realization that modern industry has to be
based on modern science. Himself a craftsman and descended from a long
line of lens makers, he early established a partnership with a
university- trained physicist, Ernst Abbé (1840-1905). After Zeiss’s
death in 1888, it was Abbé who took over the management of the
company.</p>
<p>Abbé was one of the first of the great scientist-inventors—and an
exceedingly produc- tive one. He revolutionized both the making of
optical glass and the making of precision lenses. But his greatest
achievement was not in science nor in business but in managing working
arid worker.</p>
<p>Independently of Taylor, Abbé applied what can only be called
scientific manage- ment, that is, the systematic study of work. He
analyzed the constituent operations needed to make optical glass and
then to convert optical glass into precision lenses. He then syn-
thesized both processes. The solution he came up with, around 1880 or
1885, can only be described as flexible mass production. But Abbé did
not, as Henry Ford was to do twenty years later, proceed to organize
working on the basis of these operations. Instead he turned over
responsibility for working out the jobs to the work force itself. He
called in the masters and journeymen from the plant, explained to them
the new techniques and disciplines, and asked them to organize the jobs
and to do the work.</p>
<p>To make optical glass in the quality and quantity needed—let alone at
a cost that would allow its use in such everyday instruments as
microscopes, cameras, or specta- cles—required entirely new machinery
and new tools. From the beginning, Abbé insisted that the skilled worker
himself, with the assistance of the university-educated scientist and
engineer, develop the machinery. The world monopoly which Zeiss held for
so many years rested, above all, on equipment designed, or at least
improved, by the workers themselves.</p>
<p>Abbé also introduced continuous training. By 1880 German industry had
largely sys- tematized apprentice training by combining work under a
master with schoolwork in ap- prentice classes. Abbé added systematic
training classes for fully trained and highly</p>
<p>skilled craftsmen which they were expected to attend throughout their
entire working life. There were frequent refresher sessions. The most
highly skilled men were expected to join with the engineers, chemists,
lens designers, and instrument designers in working on better methods,
on new products, and on improvements in process and technology. The
focus, as in Japan, was not on training for promotion, but on training
for improvement of skill, tool, process, and product.</p>
<p>In one respect, Abbé went far beyond the Japanese. He insisted on
feedback informa- tion to the worker regarding his output and
performance. “A craftsman is in control of his work” was a slogan he
constantly repeated.</p>
<p>There was no formal guarantee of employment security at Zeiss. Abbé,
as well as his German craftsmen, would have rejected as immoral the
Japanese custom of keeping an incompetent or lazy man on the payroll as
long as he is “loyal.” But if a man had learned to perform and showed
himself willing to work hard, he was assured of his job at Zeiss
regardless of economic fluctuations.</p>
<p>In his will, Abbé turned over the controlling ownership of Zeiss to a
foundation to which all profits were to go and of which the Zeiss
workers are to be the sole beneficiar- ies. This did not mean worker
control. The Ernst Abbé Foundation is, in effect, run by Zeiss
management and its appointed trustees. It did not make “capitalists” out
of the workers, nor was it intended to do so. Indeed, the Zeiss workers
were proud social de- mocrats from early days. Nor did it mean more
money to the workers. With ownership vested in the foundation, the Zeiss
firm had to depend on internally generated funds for its expansion,
which, in all likelihood, meant that dividends had to be kept very low.
But the Abbé Foundation could finance benefits for the workers, and from
Abbé’s own days on, these benefits were tailored to the needs of major
groups within the work force, whether scholarships for workers’
children, health benefits, or housing allowances. This made a little
money go very far toward protecting Zeiss workers against major risks
and toward providing truly meaningful benefits.</p>
<p>The IBM Story</p>
<p>The final success story to be presented here is that of IBM.*</p>
<p>Long before IBM became the world’s leading computer manufacturer, it
was a pro- ducer of fairly sophisticated technical products—at least for
that time. Today, of course, IBM’s computers and the software that goes
with them are among the most complex, most highly engineered, most
precise industrial products made anywhere. At the same time, they must
be capable of operation by mechanically unskilled personnel and must
stand up under rough usage and under a great variety of conditions.</p>
<p>This equipment is not produced by highly skilled individual
craftsmen. The equipment could be turned out neither in large quantities
nor at a price the customer could afford to pay were its production
dependent on craft skills. IBM uses semiskilled machine opera- tors. It
is prime evidence that scientific management and flexible
mass-production princi- ples can be applied to the production of the
most complex precision instruments in great diversity and in small
numbers. Of a particular model, an advanced electronic computer, for
instance, only one piece may ever be made. Yet by dividing into
homogeneous stages the job of building this unique product, IBM is able
to use semiskilled labor for all but a small part of the work. But each
job is designed so as always to contain a challenge to judgment, and
control of the speed and rhythm of his work by the worker. The story
goes that Thomas J. Watson, Sr., the company’s founder and for many
years its president, once saw a woman operator sitting idly at her
machine. Asked why she did not work, the woman replied, “I have to wait
for the setup man to change the tool setting for a new run.” “Couldn’t
you do it yourself?” Watson asked. “Of course,” said the woman, “but I
am not supposed to.” Watson thereupon found out that each worker spent
several hours each</p>
<p>*I am indebted to the study of IBM—written just before IBM’s meteoric
rise as the leading computer manufac- turer—by Charles R. Walker and F.
L. W. Richardson, Human Relations in an Expanding Company (Yale
University Press, 1948).</p>
<p>week waiting for the setup man. It would, however, take only a few
additional days of training for the worker to learn how to set up his
own machine. Thus, machine setup was added to the worker’s job. Shortly
thereafter, inspection of the finished part was included too; again
little additional training equipped the worker to do the inspecting.</p>
<p>Enlarging the job in this way produced such unexpected improvements
in output and quality of production that IBM decided to make jobs big
systematically. The operations themselves are engineered to be as simple
as possible, but each worker is trained to be able to do as many of
these operations as possible. At least one of the tasks the worker is to
perform—machine setting, for instance—is always designed so as to
require some skill or some judgment, and a range of different operations
permits variations in the rhythm with which the worker works.</p>
<p>This approach has resulted in a constant increase in productivity at
IBM. It has also significantly affected the attitudes of workers. In
fact, many observers both inside and outside the company think that the
increase in the worker’s pride in the job he is doing is the most
important gain.</p>
<p>IBM then redefined the supervisor’s job. There is no supervisor in
the traditional sense. Where other companies speak of supervisor or
foreman, IBM speaks of an “assis- tant.” This is exactly the role the
supervisor is supposed to discharge. He is to be the “as- sistant” to
his workers. His job is to be sure that they know their work and have
the tools. He is not their boss.</p>
<p>The policy of maximizing jobs has also enabled IBM to create
significant opportuni- ties for semiskilled workers. In each foreman’s
department there are one or more job in- structors. There are senior
workers who do their own work but who also help the other, less
experienced workers learn higher technical skills and solve problems
requiring ex- perience or judgment. Those positions are greatly coveted
and carry high prestige. They have proven to be an excellent preparation
for manager. They both train and test men so well that IBM has little
difficulty in finding candidates for promotion. Nor is it plagued by the
failure of newly promoted foremen to perform or to command their
subordinates’ re- spect. In most other industrial plants these are real
problems. In some companies less than half of all promotions to foreman
really “take.”</p>
<p>The second IBM innovation also seems to have developed half by
accident. When one of the first electronic computers was being developed
in the late forties, demand for it was so great (or maybe engineering
design had taken so much longer than expected) that pro- duction had to
begin before the engineering work was fully completed. The final details
were worked out on the production floor with the engineers collaborating
with foremen and workers. The result was a superior design; the
production engineering was signifi- cantly better, cheaper, faster; and
each worker, as a result of participating in engineering the product and
his work, did a significantly better and more productive job.</p>
<p>The lesson of this experience is being applied whenever IBM
introduces a new prod- uct or a major change in existing products.
Before design engineering is completed, the project is assigned to one
of the work crews. The “assistant” becomes manager of the project. He
works on the final details of design with the engineers and with the
workers who will produce the machines. He and his workers—with whatever
expert technical help is needed—plan the actual production layout and
set up the individual jobs. The worker, in other words, gets in on the
planning of the product, of the production process, and of his own job.
This method, wherever used, has given the same benefits in design,
produc- tion costs, speed, and worker satisfaction as were obtained the
first time.</p>
<p>IBM has been equally unorthodox in its rewards and incentives for
workers. Origi- nally it used the standard approach; output norms set by
the industrial engineer for each operation, a base wage for production
according to the norm, and incentive premium pay for production above
the norm. Then, in 1936, it did away with the traditional norms and with
pay incentives. Instead of wages per unit produced, IBM pays each worker
a straight salary (plus, of course, overtime payments, vacation pay,
etc.). Instead of output norms imposed from above, each worker develops
with his own foreman his own rates of pro- duction. Of course, both know
pretty well how much output can normally be expected.</p>
<p>But even for new operations or for major changes in process or job,
the determination of output norms is left to the men themselves. IBM
maintains that there is no such thing as a norm, but that each man works
out for himself, with his assistant’s help, the speed and flow of work
that will give him the most production.</p>
<p>One important result of this has been increasing emphasis by foremen
and workers alike on training and, especially, on placement. It is
obvious to everybody at IBM that there are tremendous differences in the
ability of men to do even unskilled work. Conse- quently, each foreman
tries hard to put each man on the job for which he is best fitted. And
the man himself tries to find the job he can do best—or to acquire the
skills to do his own job better.</p>
<p>When worker output went up right after the new salary plan had been
installed, many people critical of the whole idea (including a good many
in IBM) explained this away as owing to the worker’s fear of losing his
job; 1936, after all, was a Depression year. But worker output kept on
climbing right through the war years, when even large wage incen- tives
could not prevent its slipping in most other industries. And it has
continued to go up. Worker output, however, would hardly have stayed up,
let alone risen steadily, but for the company’s policy of stable
employment. This, the most radical of IBM’s innovations, was adopted
early in the Great Depression.</p>
<p>IBM is a capital-goods producer. Its products are used primarily by
business. By defi- nition, employment in such an enterprise is extremely
sensitive to economic fluctuations. At IBM’s main competitors,
employment was cut back sharply during the Depression years. IBM
management decided, however, that it was its job to maintain employment.
There was obviously only one way to do this: to develop new markels. IBM
was so suc- cessful in finding and developing these markets that
employment was actually fully main- tained right through the
thirties.</p>
<p>The Lessons</p>
<p>None of these cases deals with a miracle. None of these, more
importantly, presents a panacea.</p>
<p>This is certainly true of Japan. Indeed, the Japanese approaches,
policies, and prac- tices are rapidly becoming inappropriate to Japanese
social reality. They are being un- dermined by the same forces which
undermine the organization of working and work eve- rywhere: the
education explosion, and affluence. The education explosion is rapidly
creat- ing a labor shortage in the group from which manual workers in
Japan have always been recruited. There are no longer many youngsters,
and especially not very many young males, who leave school at age
fifteen. As a result the neat and tidy wage structure of tra- ditional
Japan is under increasing inflationary pressure which threatens to
explode the entire system of low entrance wages, guaranteed wage
increases by seniority, the benefits structure, and so on. At the same
time the young knowledge worker, the engineer or ac- countant,
increasingly chafes under a system that denies him mobility and
opportunity to rise by performance rather than by length of service.
Altogether Japan probably needs as much innovation in managing working
and worker in the next twenty years as it did when it first became a
major industrial society, around 1920.</p>
<p>Ernst Abbé’s foundation still owns and runs the Zeiss companies in
West Germany.</p>
<p>And Zeiss is still one of the most honored names in world optics. But
long ago, well be- fore World War II, Zeiss began to lose the momentum
which Abbé had given it. And a main reason for Zeiss’s relative
stagnation has, paradoxically, been Ernst Abbé himself. By providing for
exclusive ownership of the Zeiss companies in the interest of the worker
Abbé’s will bars outside financing and makes it impossible for Zeiss to
raise the capital it needs to grow and to move into new fields.</p>
<p>At IBM one of the crucial principles of the founder can hardly be
maintained any longer: employment security. With 260,000 employees, IBM
cannot guarantee every job, as it did forty years ago when employment
was in the hundreds or so. IBM has already had to lay off people—though
so far it has confined layoffs to managerial and profes-</p>
<p>sional personnel and has been able to maintain the employment
guarantee for manual workers, for whom it was, of course, originally
designed.</p>
<p>Still, while these policies are neither panaceas nor likely to endure
for eternity, they have surely been highly successful.</p>
<p>The spirit of its labor force has been one of the central factors in
the emergence of Ja- pan as the world’s second-ranking industrial power.
Zeiss owed its rapid rise and its long leadership position to the
strength of its work community, the enthusiasm of its workers, and the
creative impact they had on product, process, and tools. IBM has had the
most rapid expansion of work force any one company in industrial history
has ever reported— from a few thousand as late as 1950 to 260,000 or so
twenty years later. Yet IBM has had no labor troubles anywhere—even in
the one major plant that is located in the worst in- dustrial
“earthquake zone,” in the “Red suburbs” of Paris. It has not had major
production problems, even though the labor force more than doubled each
year. The only explanation is that the IBM workers were ready to accept
responsibility for, and to train the newcom- ers. While no computer
manufacturer is likely to have particularly high labor efficiency so
far—efficiency rarely goes together with constant upheaval—IBM, by
common consent in its industry, is about as far ahead in efficiency
compared to its competitors as General Motors is ahead in the automobile
industry.</p>
<p>What then is the essence of these success stories? What do the
Japanese, Zeiss, and IBM do that the rest of us do not do, and what do
they not do that the rest of us do?</p>
<p>Neither the Japanese, nor Zeiss, nor IBM practice “permissive
management.” Man- agement in Japan is notoriously autocratic. No one has
ever mistaken an order by a Japa- nese company president for a polite
request. Abbé, according to all reports, was not per- missive either.
While a kind man by all accounts, he was very much the German “Herr
Professor” and was used to unquestioned authority. Thomas Watson,
Sr. was a tyrant. Abbé and Watson demanded excellence in performance and
did not accept good inten- tions as a substitute.</p>
<p>These are not examples of “democratic management,” let alone of
“participatory de- mocracy.” There is no doubt in a Japanese company who
is boss. Neither Abbe nor Tho- mas Watson, Sr., was in the least
reluctant to make decisions by fiat.</p>
<p>Neither the Japanese, nor Zeiss, nor IBM have much use for
“free-form” organization.</p>
<p>The typical Japanese company is tightly structured, with formal lines
of command clearly drawn and meticulously observed. So was Abbé’s Zeiss
and Watson’s IBM.</p>
<p>These success stories in managing working and worker exemplify
something far more important than any current ism. Most theories of
managing working and worker— including such present cure-alls as
“permissiveness” or “participatory democracy”—are concerned with
organizing authority. The Japanese, Abbé at Zeiss, and Thomas Watson,
Sr., at IBM based managing working and work on organizing
responsibility.</p>

Work Community—From “My Workers” to “Fellow Employees” to “Fel- low
Managers”</p>
<p>What does the worker—unskilled or skilled, manual, clerical, or
knowledge worker— need to be able to take the burden of responsibility?
What tools does he require? What incentives? What security? And what do
manager and enterprise have to do to be able to ask the worker to take
responsibility and to expect him to respond to this demand?</p>
<p>The focus has to be on the job. The job has to make achievement
possible. The job is not everything; but it comes first. If other
aspects of working are unsatisfactory, they can spoil even the most
achieving job—just as a poor sauce can spoil the taste even of the best
meat. But if the job itself is not achieving, nothing else will provide
achievement.</p>
<p>This may be childishly obvious, but the major approaches to managing
the worker, throughout history, have focused on elements external to the
job.</p>
<p>Marxists, for example, focus on ownership but have, by and large,
left unchanged the structure of jobs and the traditional practices of
managing workers. Paternalism focuses on welfare, i.e., on things like
housing and health care—very important, to be sure, but not substitutes
for job achievement. More recent solutions such as the
“co-determination” which the German labor unions are pushing put union
representatives on the board of directors and into top management but do
not concern themselves with the worker’s job itself.</p>
<p>The fundamental reality for every worker, from sweeper to executive
vice president, is the eight hours or so he spends on the job. In our
society of organizations, it is the job through which the great majority
has access to achievement, to fulfillment, and to com- munity.</p>
<p>To enable the worker to achieve, he must therefore first be able to
take responsibility for his job.</p>
<p>This requires: (1) productive work; (2) feedback information; and (3)
continuous learning.</p>
<p>It is folly to ask workers to take responsibility for their job when
the work has not been studied, the process has not been synthesized, the
standards and controls have not been thought through, and the physical
information tools have not been designed. It is also managerial
incompetence.</p>
<p>The Fallacy of Creativity</p>
<p>This goes counter to the old—and continually revived—slogan of the
individual’s creativ- ity. “Free people from restraint and they will
come up with far better, far more advanced, far more productive answers
than the experts,” is an old belief. It was popular long before the
eighteenth century, though it was then given its classical formulation
by Rousseau. But there is no evidence to support it. Everything we know
indicates that creativity can become effective only if the basic tools
are given. Everything we know also indicates that the proper structure
of work of any work—is not intuitively obvious.</p>
<p>People have shoveled sand for untold centuries. Most of the time, one
can assume, nobody told them how to do it. If making work productive
depended on the creativity of people, they would undoubtedly have found
the best way of doing the job before the dawn of history. Yet when
Taylor first looked at the job in 1885, he found everything wrong. The
size and shape of the shovel were unsuited to the job. The length of the
handle was wrong. The amount of sand the shoveler lifted in the
operation was the wrong amount, was indeed the amount most calculated to
tire him and do him physical harm. The con- tainers were the wrong shape
the wrong size and in the wrong position and so on.</p>
<p>The same thing held for the work of the physician through the ages.
The nineteenth- century differential diagnosis, i.e., the systematic
analysis of the work of the physician, organized the work differently
from the way in which countless practitioners of high intel- ligence,
high skill, and considerable education had done it “intuitively” through
the ages.</p>
<p>The best proof that creativity is no substitute for analysis and
knowledge are the ex- periences of those enterprises which were
expropriated by governments with the profes- sionals either expelled or
leaving. Among them is the Mexican takeover of the petroleum industry in
the 1930s, the Iranian takeover of the big oil refinery in Abadan under
Premier Mossadegh, the expropriation of the Bolivian tin mines, and the
expropriation of the Chilean copper mines and copper smelters. Every one
of these moves was wildly popular among the workers of these
enterprises. Every one released a flood tide of enthusiasm. But as soon
as the managers, professionals, and technicians departed or were thrown
out, productivity collapsed and was not restored until managers and
professionals returned.</p>
<p>Feedback Information for Self-Control</p>
<p>The second prerequisite for worker responsibility is feedback
information on his own performance. Responsibility requires
self-control. That in turn requires continuous infor- mation on
performance against standards.</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of interest lately in the application of
“behavior modifica- tion” to work. In particular there has been great
interest in the approach worked out by a major air freight forwarder,
Emery Air Freight, which found out that workers on all levels will
manage their own performance if only they are being informed immediately
what their performance actually is. Actually we have known this for many
years.</p>
<p>Zeiss, as has been said before, built in feedback information almost
a hundred years ago. IBM did so forty years ago. The Japanese continuous
learning session is a way to provide feedback information. Modern
medical practice was founded 150 years ago de- signing a feedback from
autopsy results to diagnosis.</p>
<p>We also know that people can control and correct performance if given
the informa- tion, even if neither they nor the supplier of information
truly understand what has to be done or how. This applies even to
processes that are, by definition, “uncontrollable,” such as a great
many processes in the human body, e.g., heartbeat, brain waves, or
asthma at- tacks. Visual feedback which enables an asthmatic child to
see on a control panel infor- mation on the constriction of blood
vessels and muscles in his throat does not tell the child what to do.
Indeed, no one knows. Yet if the child knows that the needle which de-
picts graphically the state of the blood vessels and muscles should stay
in the center of the panel, he can, in many cases, abort an asthma
attack.</p>
<p>Few work processes are as inaccessible to analysis as brain waves or
asthma attacks, yet in a good many we still cannot exactly know the
process. The worker himself, given the information, can control his own
work and output.</p>
<p>Emery Air Freight had conducted industrial engineering studies for
many years. Yet management did not really know what an individual truck
driver would have to do to make the largest possible number of calls on
his route. The drivers, however, without ana- lyzing driving time or
length of a call, could in practically every case control their own
schedule and raise the number of calls significantly once they knew how
many calls they actually made as against the numbers they had planned to
make.</p>
<p>This approach applies even to such advanced knowledge work as
research. Feedback in research does not mean a daily report as in the
case of truck drivers. Rather it means sitting down with the research
scientists several times a year and saying, “Here are the things of
significance this research group has contributed to the company during
the last six and twelve months. And here are the impacts earlier
research work has had on the company’s performance during the last six
and twelve months.”</p>
<p>The information the worker needs must satisfy the requirements of
effective informa- tion (see Chapter 18). It must be timely. It must be
relevant. It must be operational. It must focus on his job. Above all,
it must be his tool. Its purpose must be self-control rather than
control of others, let alone manipulation.</p>
<p>The real strength of feedback information—and the major reinforcer—is
clearly that the information is the tool of the worker for measuring and
directing himself. The worker does not need praise or reproach to know
how he is doing. He knows.</p>
<p>Continuous Learning</p>
<p>The third requirement for achievement in work and for a responsible
worker is continuous learning.</p>
<p>There is need for workers, whether unskilled, skilled, or knowledge
worker, to be trained for new skills. Continuous learning does not
replace training. It has different aims and satisfies different needs.
Above all, it satisfies the need of the employee to contribute what he
himself has learned to the improvement of his own performance, to the
improve- ment of his fellow worker’s performance, and to a better, more
efiective, but also more rational way of working.</p>
<p>It is also the one way to come to grips with two basic problems: the
resistance of workers to innovation, and the danger that workers will
become “obsolete.”</p>
<p>“Engineers become obsolete within ten years,” we are now being told.
If indeed true, it is a severe indictment of the employer. An engineer
who starts with the proper founda- tion of knowledge for his work has no
business becoming obsolete. The continuing im- provement of his own
skill and knowledge at his own job should be built into his daily
work.</p>
<p>Continuous learning need not be organized as a formal session the way
it is tradition- ally done in Japan. But it always needs to be
organized. There is need for the continuing challenge to the worker:
“What have you learned that can make your job and the job of all of us
more productive, more performing, and more achieving? What do you need
by way of knowledge, by way of tools, by way of information? And how do
we best prepare our- selves for new needs, new methods, new performance
capacities?”</p>
<p>Continuous training is as appropriate to clerical work as it is in
manual work. It is of particular importance in knowledge work. The very
fact that knowledge work, to be effec- tive, has to be specialized
creates a need for continuous exposure to the experiences, the problems,
the needs of others, and in turn, for continuous contribution of
knowledge and information to others. Whether the knowledge work be
accounting or market research, planning or chemical engineering, the
work group has to be seen and has to see itself as a learning group.</p>
<p>Planning and Doing</p>
<p>These three prerequisites, (1) productive work, (2) feedback
information, and (3) con- tinuous learning, are, so to speak, the
planning for worker responsibility for job, work group, and output. They
are therefore management responsibilities and management tasks. But they
are not “management prerogatives,” i.e., things management does alone,
by it- self, and unilaterally. Management does indeed have to do the
work and make the deci- sions. But in all these areas the worker
himself, from the beginning, needs to be integrated as a “resource” into
the planning process. From the beginning he has to share in thinking
through work and process, tools and information. His knowledge, his
experience, his needs are resource to the planning process. The worker
needs to be a partner in it. Every attempt should be made to make
accessible to the worker the necessary knowledge. He need not become an
industrial engineer or a process designer, but the fundamentals of
industrial engineering and their application to a man’s own job and work
can be grasped by almost anyone without great difficulty.</p>
<p>One of the first attempts—and one of the most successful ones—to make
workers a resource in making work productive was (as mentioned earlier)
“work simplification.” One of Taylor’s disciples, Allan Mogensen, ran
this program for many years, from the twenties to the forties, at Lake
Placid, New York. Mogensen’s thesis was that scientific management would
be successful if supervisors understood its principles, could apply them
themselves, and could teach them to their own workers. What was needed,
Mogen- sen argued, was for scientific management to become a simple,
everyday, comfortable tool of the working group itself. He showed that
unschooled people who, however, knew what working was, could obtain
results as good as those of the most highly trained indus- trial
engineer.</p>
<p>There is no reason why work simplification has to be taught at a
special institute and away from the work place. In Japanese industry,
beginning with the first application of scientific management in the
1920s by such companies as Sumitomo Electric and Mitsu- bishi Electric,
supervisors and workers have learned the principles of industrial
engineer- ing as a matter of course in the continuous-training
sessions.</p>
<p>Worker responsibility for job, work groups, and output cannot he
expected, let alone demanded, until the foundations of productive work,
feedback information, and continu- ous learning have been established.
Worker participation in assigning these foundations should be brought
into play from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Creativity, if by that is meant undirected, unstructured, untutored,
and uncontrolled guessing, is not likely to produce results. But a
system which does not tap and put to use the knowledge, experience,
resources, and imagination of the people who have to live with the
system and make it work is as unlikely to be effective.</p>
<p>This is not seen generally, largely because of a confusion of
planning and doing with planner and doer. It was Taylor who first
enunciated as a principle that planning and do- ing are different.
Taylor saw that planning won’t get done if it is mixed in with doing.
Long before Taylor, however, the designers of the German General Staff
in the early nineteenth century had set up planning as a separate
task.</p>
<p>The two are separate activities, like reading and writing, and
require different methods and different approaches. But planner and
doer, like reader and writer, need to be united in the same person. They
cannot be divorced—or else the planning will cease to be effec- tive and
will indeed become a threat to performance.</p>
<p>The planner is needed to supply the doer with direction and
measurements, with the tools of analysis and synthesis, with
methodology, and with standards. He is needed also to make sure that the
planning of one group is compatible with the planning of the others. But
in turn, the planner needs the doer as his resource and as his feedback
control. And unless the planner knows what the doer does and needs, his
planning, while theoretically perfect, may never become execution.
Conversely, unless the doer understands what the planner tries to
accomplish, the doer will not perform or will try to resist performance
specifications that to him seem unreasonable, arbitrary, or just plain
silly.</p>
<p>And the less capable the planner is of analyzing the work and its
individual opera- tions, the more does he depend on the doer. In
knowledge work, above all, the doer has to take a responsible part in
the planning process for it to be etfective at all.</p>
<p>But still, the foundations for worker responsibility are planning and
are therefore managerial responsibilities.</p>
<p>The Need for Clear Authority</p>
<p>One more thing is needed to make responsibility acceptable to the
worker: he needs to have the security of a clear authority structure. He
has to know what areas and decisions are beyond his power and beyond his
purview and therefore reserved for a different or a higher authority.
Management has to work out what the task is, what the objectives are,
what the standards are. Again, the doers should be used as a source of
information. But the job is management’s.</p>
<p>Also, organization stands under the threat of the “common peril.”
There is always the chance of an emergency situation which has not been
anticipated and for which there are no rules. The common peril may be
physical—in business it will more often be economic. Whatever its
nature, one man has to make the decision in such a situation, and fast,
or everybody is endangered. Who this man is has to be known in advance,
or there is chaos. And this man has to be able to say, “This needs to be
done; you do it; this way.” The sur- vival of the group depends on his
unquestioned authority. Without it no one in the work group can feel
secure.</p>
<p>Responsibility for Job and Work Groups</p>
<p>The layout of individual jobs to do the work and to meet its
standards, and the design, structure, and relationship of the work group
in which these jobs are integrated into a community, are and should be
the responsibility of workers and work group. They need professional
help. They need knowledge, experience, and teaching from their
supervisor. They need advice and service from the industrial engineer
and from many other techni- cians and professionals. Management must
retain a veto power, and will often exercise it. But the responsibility
for job design and work-group design belongs to those who are
responsible for output and performance. And that is the worker and the
work group.</p>
<p>Worker responsibility for job and group will vary greatly with the
kind of work to be done, with the educational, skill, and knowledge
level of the work force, and with cultures and traditions. It will
certainly look very different when the workers are research scientists
rather than hard-core unemployables from the black ghetto or guest
workers in German industry from the hill farms of eastern Anatolia.</p>
<p>But the principles are the same: the worker and his group are
responsible for, their own jobs and for the relationships between
individual jobs. They are responsible for thinking through how the work
is to be done. They are responsible for meeting perform- ance goals and
for quality as well as for quantity. And they are responsible for
improving work, job, tools and processes, and their own skills.</p>
<p>These are exacting demands. Yet whenever we have made them, they have
been met—provided that the planning had been done. Indeed in most
cases—IBM is the typical example—workers will set higher performance
goals than the industrial engineer and will tend to outdo their own
goals.</p>
<p>The reason is not that work has become fun—nor should it. It is not
just motivation, though psychological factors undoubtedly play an
important part. In large measure, worker responsibility for job design
and work-group design are effective because they make use of the
worker’s knowledge and experience in the one area where he is the ex-
pert.</p>
<p>To expect worker creativity in making work productive is, as said
earlier, sentimental twaddle. But it is realistic to expect knowledge
and expertise with respect to the worker’s own job, that is, in putting
conceptual and physical tools into use and performance. Here the worker
is the only expert. For a job is a configuration. It defies analysis.
But it is eas-</p>
<p>ily accessible to perception. Particularly if feedback information is
provided, the individ- ual can normally work out his own optimal job
design fairly fast and fairly effectively.</p>
<p>For the design of the work group, responsibility on the part of the
members is even more important. We now know* that the work itself,
whether heat-treating, selling furni- ture, or probing the molecular
structure of a hormone, is a vital factor in job design and work-group
structure. But we do not know what job design and work-group structure
cor- respond to this or that task and work.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the way every one of the groups studied by Joan
Woodward organizes itself is obvious and right. But nothing can be
deduced from one such solution for the optimal structure and
organization of the next job. There are general rules. But they are so
general, e.g., “Work-group structure and organization will be
appropriate to the task to be performed, the personalities, skills and
values of the workers, the physical environment and the tools,” that no
“how-to-do-it” conclusions emerge.</p>
<p>Work-group structure is a configuration of great complexity even
though it is com- posed of a fairly small number of fairly simple
elements. It resembles a kaleidoscope. Fairly small shifts drastically
change the pattern. And the number of combinations and permutations is
so large as to approach infinity.</p>
<p>In such a situation the only way to arrive at the right, the optimal
solution is trial. The outsider, e.g., the industrial engineer, can
help. But he cannot analytically arrive at the answer. The group itself,
however, usually arrives at a right answer fairly fast and without much
trouble. It works things out.</p>
<p>Assembly Line and Job Enrichment</p>
<p>The pressure for changes in the traditional ways of managing worker
and working has been building up these last decades as the “new breed”
has come into the work force and as the old motivating drives of hunger
and fear have rapidly lost their power. The pressure has been greatest
on the traditional assembly line of manufacturing industry. The conven-
tional view has always been that the assembly line is, by its very
nature, incapabte of be- ing run any other way than from the top and by
command.</p>
<p>IBM and Zeiss, as mentioned before, disproved this long ago. So did
our World War II experience in defense production. Nothing that is now
being proposed, for instance, goes quite as far in demanding
responsibility from the worker as some of the U.S. defense plants of
World War II. There the worker had to take responsibility because of the
short- age of industrial engineers, supervisors, and managers.</p>
<p>An example† was one of the largest aircraft engine plants with a
product which, by the standards of the times, was exceedingly complex
and required high skill. Yet each team assembled one entire engine—a
product considerably more complex than any automobile. Each team
organized the job slightly differently, with different men doing
different opera- tions at different times. Each, however, started out
with a foundation in work study and was supplied with full information.
And each engaged in continuous learning. It met sev- eral times a week
with its foreman and with the engineering staff to discuss improvements
in work and jobs. Each team exceeded, by substantial margins, the output
standards which the engineers had suggested. These World War II
experiences—and they could be matched by similar experiences in all
major industrial countries—were forgotten again. They seemed to reflect
a temporary emergency rather than fundamentals. Now we are rediscovering
the same principles again. And wherever tried, the results are the
same.</p>
<p>Among the most significant changes are those of the most rigid and
most highly engi- neered line, the automobile assembly line.</p>
<p>*E.g., through the work of Joan Woodward and her group in England;
see especially her book, Industrial Or- ganization: Theory and Practice
(Oxford University Press, 1965). The intensive studies of work, work
group, and worker which Charles R. Walker of Yale University made in the
forties and fifties reported, for instance, in Charles R. Walker and
Robert H. Guest, The Man on the Assembly Line (Harvard University Press,
1952), had reached and documented the same conclusions earlier.</p>
<p>†Other examples are discussed in both my books, Concept of the
Corporation and The New Society.</p>
<p>In the United States, Chrysler is experimenting with responsibility
on the part of the workers for assembly line operations. In a Chrysler
plant in Detroit, employees were actu- ally asked to reevaluate the
entire manufacturing operation as a result of which the whole plant was
reorganized, resulting in higher output with fewer men.</p>
<p>The most systematic approaches to worker responsibility to automobile
assembly line jobs are those taken by the two Swedish automobile makers,
Saab and Volvo, both acting under the pressure of severe labor
shortages.*</p>
<p>In one Swedish plant, one work group will take responsibility for the
assembly of the total car. The output standard, that is, the number of
cars per hour, and the quality stan- dard will be set by the plant. The
process will have been worked out. But the structure of jobs, their
scope, their relationship, and the organization of the work group are
worked out by the men themselves with their supervisors and the
industrial engineer.</p>
<p>Other features of the Swedish experiment include the formation of
development groups which include production workers and which discuss
such matters as new tool and machine design before they are approved for
construction; temporary assignment of workers to a team of production
engineers to work on specific production problems, and the shifting of
responsibility for process inspection from a separate quality inspection
unit to the production worker. The quality inspection unit now
concentrates exclusively on the completed product (in line with the
principle stated in Chapter 18 that inspection is not quality control of
the product but is the quality control of the quality control process
it- self). Finally, workers’ tasks have been expanded by the workers
themselves to include maintenance of the equipment, which was previously
the responsibility of special mechan- ics—thus applying to the
automobile assembly line what Ernst Abbé did for the produc- tion of
precision optics in the 1890s and Thomas Watson for the production of
electronic equipment in the 1940s and 1950s. These examples could be
multiplied ad infinitum.</p>
<p>In a major American department-store chain responsibility for job
design was turned over to the salespeople. Salespeople in these stores
are on commission and competition among individuals is high. Yet the
salespeople immediately tackled job design as a group problem—with the
clear goal of optimizing every salesperson’s opportunity to earn the
maximum commission. They focused on the question “What changes in the
way the work is being done would help all of us?” They came up with a
demand for continuous train- ing—in merchandising, in selling methods,
in paper handling, and so on. What they wanted—and got—was a little time
each week to sit down together with an experienced expert from store
operations or sales training to discuss their experiences and to suggest
to each other whatever methods would work the best. But they also came
up with sugges- tions for changes in the way the selling floor was
organized. The idea of having a clerk who handles the paperwork for all
the salespeople in the department (mentioned in Chap- ter 18 above) was
one of their ideas, for instance, and first tried by them.</p>
<p>But outside of the assembly line there is also growing demand for
“job enrichment.”† In job enrichment the expert, e.g., the industrial
engineer, defines the “modules” of the work, the individual operations
that have to be performed. He establishes the standards and analyzes the
information the worker needs. But then the worker himself designs his or
her job, that is, the number of modules that constitute “my” job, their
sequence, speed, rhythm. The result is higher output, better quality,
and a sharp drop in employee turnover.</p>
<p>Job enrichment has so far been tried primarily in clerical
operations. It would seem, however, to be particularly applicable to
knowledge work.</p>
<p>Zeiss, IBM, and a good many Japanese companies have been practicing
job enrich- ment for decades. And the way claims settlement has been
done for decades in some</p>
<p>*For these experiments, see Jan-Peter Norstedt, Work Organization and
Job Design of Saab-Scandia in Söder- talje (Stockholm, Swedish Employers
Federation, 1970) and “How to Counter Alienation in the Plant,” by
Richard E. Walton (Harvard Business Review, November/December, 1972).
This article gives several more examples from other industries, mainly
the Uttited States.</p>
<p>†The best short description containing a wealth of examples is the
article, “Job Enrichment Lessons from ATandandandandT” by Robert N.
Ford, in the January/February 1973 issue of the Harvard Business
Review.</p>
<p>German and Japanese insurance companies (see Chapter 18) is job
enrichment pure and simple. Even the American automobile industry
practiced it—way beyond anything job enrichment now tries to do—during
World War II.* We have known what to do for a very long time. That it is
now being heralded as a discovery is somewhat ironic—but harmless as
long as it is being done.</p>
<p>But what is not so harmless is the belief that job enrichment is the
answer. It is only a first step. IBM, the Japanese, and Zeiss mobilized
the energies of the work group. Job enrichment confines the worker’s
responsibility to his own individual job. But he also should be expected
to assume responsibility for the work group, its relationship in and
through the work process, its structure and its cohesion.</p>
<p>Worker Responsibility and the “New Breeds”</p>
<p>Worker responsibility for job and work group is important for all
kinds of workers in to- day’s organizations. It is fundamental to a
civilization in which three out of every four people at work are
employees in organizations.</p>
<p>But worker responsibility is particularly important for the three
groups one might call “the new breeds” —though for different
reasons.</p>
<p>The first of these groups is the new breed of young manual workers.
These men and women (as said in Chapter 15) arrive at work already
rejected, already losers. Yet, though they are the rejects of the
educational system, they have had long years of schooling and have, by
any historical standard, a high degree of education. They are not the
wretched illiterates of the industrial slums of 1850. Their formal
knowledge may be limited. But their horizon is wide—if only because of
TV. And they are, by and large, not motivated by carrot and stick. They
are resentful—in many cases with good reason—because the lack of
scholastic success which has condemned them to inferior status does not
appear to them a genuine, a true, a valid criterion. At the same time,
they have doubts about their own ability to perform and to achieve,
about their own manhood, about their own dignity. These men (and women)
need achievement to overcome their habit of defeat. Otherwise, they will
forever be in a state of smoldering resentment and rebellion. They need
respon- sibility to overcome their feelings of inferiority. They need a
challenge in which they can succeed. They are suspicious—every earlier
contact with authority has conditioned them to be suspicious. Yet they
need self-assurance and security, more than any other group in the work
force.</p>
<p>This is, above all, the lesson of the widely publicized revolt of
General Motors work- ers at the new Lordstown assembly plant in Ohio.
That these young men resented the im- position of the rigid General
Motors assembly line discipline is not surprising and is noth- ing new.
At every major assembly plant General Motors had built during the last
thirty years, the workers reacted the same way. The newspaper account of
Lordstown read ex- actly like the interviews with, and reports on,
workers of the big assembly plant in New England which General Motors
built in the late forties.†</p>
<p>The real difference—and it is an important one—is that the young
white and Black workers at Lordstown felt almost to a man that they
could have done a better job design- ing their own work and the assembly
line than the General Motors industrial engineers did.</p>
<p>Lordstown got all the publicity. But not too far away, in the same
Midwestern indus- trial area, another company opened a major new plant
at about the same time GM opened Lordstown. It employs the same kind of
labor—perhaps an even larger proportion of Blacks than Lordstown—pays
the same wages, and has very similar assembly line work. It too is fully
unionized. Yet this plant had apparently very little trouble. And its
produc- tivity from the beginning was at least as high as the standards
the Lordstown workers de- cried as “speed-up” and rejected. The one
difference is that this other new plant studied</p>
<p>*See, for instance, the example of totally unskilled Negro women
workers producing high-precision parts and assembling them, in Chapter
22 of my Practice of Management.</p>
<p>†See Charles R. Walker and Robert H. Guest, The Man on the Assembly
Line (Harvard University Press, 1952).</p>
<p>and applied IBM’s policies. It engineered the work thoroughly. It
worked out the worker’s and the foreman’s information needs, by bringing
worker and foreman into the planning process as participants and a
resource. And then it demanded from the work group responsibility for
job design and work-group design—and obtained it.</p>
<p>The “Pre-Industrials”</p>
<p>The second group, an entirely different one whatever its outward
similarity, is the large number of recent immigrants from pre-industrial
civilizations into modern city and mod- ern organization: the Turks and
other guest workers in Germany, the Sicilians in Torino, the Blacks in
the United States, the sharecroppers from the drought-ridden sugar
planta- tions of Brazil’s Northeast in São Paulo, and Indians from the
pueblo in Mexico City.</p>
<p>In many ways these workers need paternalism. They need to be looked
after. They are not at home in modern society; they are frightened by
it, lost in it. But at the same time, they need to be integrated into
modern society for their own sake as well as for that of the society to
which they move. Otherwise they will become a disturbing, an unsettled,
a pathological influence. Again, what is needed is to inculcate in these
workers the habit of responsibility and the taste of achievement.</p>
<p>While Fiat in Torino has been largely unable to integrate Sicilian
immigrants and has at times been all but paralyzed by their despair,
anger, and resistance, Olivetti, in nearby Ivrea, has apparently had
little trouble with the same Sicilian immigrants. Olivetti went through
pretty rough times in the sixties after the death of its founder, when
the very sur- vival of the company was in jeopardy; Fiat had a boom with
steadily rising wages and high employment security. Both companies are
highly paternalistic. But at Olivetti there is a long tradition—somewhat
reminiscent of Zeiss—of worker responsibility for job and work
group.</p>
<p>The most dramatic demonstration I know of the need of this
pre-industrial group and of its willingness to assume responsibility is
the experience of a large textile mill on South America’s west coast.
The mill is almost entirely manned by Indians from the High Andes who
have only recently migrated to the coastal city and are strangers to
modern society and even to the Spanish spoken in the city. For years
management had depended on fear. Production and performance at the mill,
however, had been going down steadily. By the early 1950s the mill was
near collapse. Quality had become so bad that the output was almost
unsalable. Machines were antiquated and had not been maintained for
years. A new general manager brought in from Europe submitted to the
owners a comprehensive plan to rebuild the plant, buy new machinery,
train supervision, and so on. But the needed capital could not be
raised. Yet the mill could not be closed for political and legal rea-
sons. The new general manager thereupon decided to do the only thing
left: to lay out work as productively as could be done on the obsolete
machines; to set specific standards for department and section; to
supply the men in each department and section with feed- back on their
own performance; and to impose on them responsibility for the design of
jobs, the arrangement of tools and machines, and the structure of work
groups. Productiv- ity, within a year or so, almost tripled and in some
areas, such as the dye shed, almost quadrupled. Where production up to
minimum quality standards had been the exception, it became the rule.
And for the first time in many years, it became possible to introduce
new materials, new patterns, and new techniques.</p>
<p>The Knowledge Worker</p>
<p>Finally there is the knowledge worker, and especially the advanced
knowledge worker. He has to be a “knowledge professional” (on this see
Chapter 30, “What Makes a Man- ager?”). This means that no one can
motivate him. He has to motivate himself. No one can direct him. He has
to direct himself. Above all, no one can supervise him. He is the
guardian of his own standards, of his own performance, and of his own
objectives. He can be productive only if he is responsible for his own
job.</p>
<p>Saving the Supervisor</p>
<p>To make the worker responsible for his job and for that of the work
group is also the best—and may be the only—way to restore the supervisor
to health and function.</p>
<p>For a half century or more the first-line supervisor, especially in
manufacturing and clerical work, has seen his role shrinking in status,
in importance, and in esteem. Where a supervisor was “management” to the
employee only half a century ago, he has now, by and large, become a
buffer between management, union, and workers. And like all buff- ers,
his main function is to take the blows.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the modern industrial plant the supervisor is increasingly
becoming the “en- emy.” He is separated from the men he supervises by an
ever-higher wall of resentment, suspicion, and hostility. At the same
time, he is separated from management by his lack of technical and
managerial knowledge. Similarly ambivalent is the role of the supervisor
of knowledge workers. His subordinates consider him their spokesman and
expect him to protect them and their knowledge area against managerial
demands and managerial igno- rance. Management, on the other hand,
expects him to integrate the knowledge and exper- tise of the people in
his area with the mission, purpose, and objectives of the institution.
Increasingly he finds himself disavowed by both, by his subordinates
because he is no longer truly a scientist or an expert but has “sold
out” to management, and by manage- ment because he is parochial,
departmentalized, and one-sided.</p>
<p>Frederick Taylor seventy-five years ago saw clearly that the
traditional supervisor was losing function. His proposed solution was to
split the job into a number of functions, and to have different
supervisors for scheduling and training, for tool maintenance, and for
discipline, all of them acting together as a “planning committee” but
each with direct au- thority in his field over the men.</p>
<p>This did not prove to be feasible; there has to be one focal point
for the work group.</p>
<p>But the functional competences for which Taylor wanted to have
separate supervisors have nonetheless been taken over by an array of
specialists: personnel people and quality control men; maintenance
people and schedulers, coordinators and planners. As a result, the
supervisor has been left with the sole function of maintaining
discipline, that is, with the function of being feared.</p>
<p>The crisis of the supervisor has been studied the most in the United
States. But it is worldwide. It may have gone even further in Great
Britain, for instance, where the super- visor has been rendered impotent
by union militants who can and do negotiate directly with plant and
company management. The respected Meister of the German tradition is
fast becoming a thing of the past, as countless articles and speeches in
Germany assert. And when the Swedes went into the radical redesign of
the automobile assembly line, one of the main reasons given was the
plight of the supervisor and the difficulty of getting good men to
accept supervisory positions.</p>
<p>No organization can function well if its supervisory force does not
function. Supervi- sors are, so to speak, the ligaments, the tendons and
sinews, of an organization. They pro- vide the articulation. Without
them, no joint can move. It is the supervisor’s job to be in the middle.
Hence he must have responsibility, function, and respect in both his
relation- ships, upward to management and downward to the work group.
The crisis of the supervi- sor would by itself be reason enough to think
seriously about the organization of the worker and working. For making
the worker achieving, making him responsible, is the one way of making
the supervisor function again. In organizations—again, Zeiss and IBM are
the examples—where worker responsibility has been the guiding concept
for manag- ing worker and working, the supervisor is effective. Only he
is effective differently. He becomes resource for the worker and the
work group.</p>
<p>Worker and work group, in order to take responsibility, have to have
an organized source of knowledge, of information, of direction, of
arbitration, and a channel for contact and information flow to and from
the various experts. Worker and work group also need discipline—though
correctional discipline, which in today’s manufacturing plant tends to
be the supervisor’s main job, should rarely have to be exercised. But
the proper role of</p>
<p>the supervisor is not supervision. It is knowledge, information,
placing, training, teaching, standard-setting and guiding. It is not an
easy role—old supervisors find it difficult—but it is a tenable role. It
no longer imposes a conflict of loyalties—between the supervisor’s work
group and management; between the demands of personality and the demands
of work; between human relations and discipline. As the resource to the
achieving worker and his work group, the supervisor can again become
whole. He can serve, in one and the same act and in one and the same
role, both the objective needs of the enterprise (or per- formance and
the personal needs of workers for achievement.</p>
<p>Plant and Office as Communities</p>
<p>Plant and office are more than just geographic locations. They are
communities. We speak meaningfully of the prevailing atmosphere of an
office or of a mill. We study their “culture.” We speak of “patterns” of
“formal” or “informal” organization, of prevailing “values,” of “career
ladders.” And though there are great differences in degree between the
most paternalistic and the most impersonal plant and office, all are
expected to dis- charge community functions. There is, in other words, a
work community.</p>
<p>To make workers achieving they must also take substantial
responsibility for the work community.</p>
<p>Plant and office need governance. The power dimension is an inherent
and inescap- able dimension of organization.</p>
<p>But not all decisions within an organization are inherent in its
purpose and mission or directly related to its performance. There are
decisions which, while necessary, have their origin in the needs and
realities of the work community rather than in the mission, pur- pose,
and performance capacity of the organization itself. They are incidental
to the pur- pose of the organization rather than integral to it.</p>
<p>It is a law of governance that it restrict itself to the necessary
decisions. Any govern- ing body will be the more effective, and more
powerful, the more it eschews decisions it does not have to make.</p>
<p>An incidental decision which does not materially, add to the
performance capacity of the institution takes just as much time as a
basic and necessary one. Incidental decisions clog the governing
machinery, load down the governing and decision-making group, and
detract it from the important things. At the same time, authority over
such decisions is not in effect legitimate. Such decisions are not
grounded in the “purposes for which govern- ment was instituted among
men,” to use the old and elegant phrase. To be sure, they have to be
made. But the governing body of the institution is the wrong authority
for making them.</p>
<p>Work-community decisions are decisions that should be decentralized.
They are not, however, business decisions, i.e., the decisions which
federal decentralization of business enterprise lodges in lower,
operating decentralized managements (see Chapter 46). They are social
decisions, decisions regarding the affairs of the work community. They
there- fore need to be lodged in the work community—and the principle
behind this is not too different from the principle behind
decentralization of business decision-making.</p>
<p>If management makes work-community decisions, it loads itself down
with matters which appear petty to management, though they are of great
importance to the plant community itself. There are decisions on the
cafeteria, on vacation schedules, on running recreational activities,
and so on. In the typical enterprise management people deal with these
things. This is costly, inefficient, and a constant cause of friction
and dissatisfaction. These activities are run poorly and the decisions
are made badly because for management the areas are not important, do
not deserve a high priority and are not accorded respect.</p>
<p>These are, however, important matters of “hygiene” to the work
community and its members. If these things are run badly, they impede
morale. But running them superbly well adds little, if they are run from
above. The responsibility for these activities and de- cisions needs to
be placed squarely on the work community.</p>
<p>The Need for Leadership Opportunities</p>
<p>At the same time, these areas offer major opportunities for
leadership, for responsibility, for recognition, and for learning. The
men who head these activities are important people in the work
community. The people making the decisions in these areas are also
forced to learn what managing is and what managerial responsibility
means. They learn that choices have to be made, priorities have to be
set, and that the infinite number of things it would be nice to have
must be fitted to the available resources.</p>
<p>In the absence of such opportunities for leadership in the work
community, the abili- ties, energies, and ambitions within the work
force may be directed against management and against the work community.
They will be negative, destructive, demagogic. The one who can make the
most trouble for the bosses will be the leader rather than the one who
can perform the best for the plant community.</p>
<p>The shop steward who, as so many do in English and American plants,
defines his role as “harassment” and who is elected for revolutionary
rhetoric rather than for capacity and performance is the alternative to
leaders chosen to be responsible and to perform.</p>
<p>Responsibility is not by itself a guarantee of performance. But lack
of responsibility breeds the demagogue.</p>
<p>Work-Community Activities</p>
<p>The list of activities for which a work community might be asked to
take responsibility is almost endless.*</p>
<p>Richard E. Walton (in the Harvard Business Review article mentioned
earlier) de- scribes a plant built by a large food manufacturer in 1958
which systematically imposes responsibility for work-community decisions
on the work force. Among them are such tasks as the control of manning
assignments to cover for temporarily absent employees; selecting men
from the plant to serve on plant committees or task forces; screening
and selecting employees to fill vacancies; counseling workers who do not
meet standards with respect to absences or punctuality. Members of the
plant community also were put on the plant safety committee. Safety is,
after all, a concern of the people in the plant—and they also know more
about it than anybody else, as a rule, or at least know more about where
the safety problems are.</p>
<p>Another example of self-government in a work community is the nuclear
submarine.</p>
<p>Obviously, a submarine cannot be a permissive place. The captain has
to be the final au- thority whose word nobody dares dispute. Yet the
crew, regardless of rank, acts and works as one unit. No one can join
the crew unless he is accepted by it. And while the captain decides what
should be done, each man on his own station then has to decide how to do
a specific job and do it as if the life of everybody depended on him, as
indeed it does.</p>
<p>The Self-Governing Work Community</p>
<p>A self-governing work community is not “participatory democracy.”</p>
<p>Neither at Zeiss nor in the food company mentioned earlier, nor in a
submarine, are there elections or mass meetings. The working teams are
organized by management for specific operations and specific jobs.</p>
<p>Work-community self-government may not be—and maybe should not—
“democ- racy” altogether. Authority and assignments may go by
seniority—as they do in Japanese plants, but as they also largely did at
Zeiss. What matters is that self-government of plant- community tasks be
local self-government and that it put responsibility where the conse-
quences of the decisions have to be lived with.</p>
<p>*Many of them are mentioned in my earlier books; especially Concept
of the Corporation and The New Soci- ety.</p>
<p>We do not have all the answers to managing worker and working. The
society of or- ganizations is new—only seventy years ago employees were
a small minority in every society. The attenuation of carrot and stick
as driving forces is new. The emergence of a highly schooled work force
is new. The new breed of manual workers is new. And the emergence of the
knowledge worker is also new.</p>
<p>But we know what the questions are. We know the approaches. And we
know the goals—though we may never attain them.</p>
<p>The attenuation of carrot and stick was heralded around 1900 by a
semantic change.</p>
<p>In the old days the “boss” issued a proclamation or order “to my
workers.” After 1900 he increasingly addressed himself “to our fellow
employees.” At about the same time the German Unternehmer began to talk
of Mitarbeiter (literally “fellow employee”)—a term that had first been
coined by the civil service a century earlier. Often enough, of course,
the new term was only a semantic mask for tyranny. But it reflected the
passing of the “master” and the arrival of modern organization in which
even the top man is another hired hand, another employee who derives
whatever authority he has from responsibility and performance rather
than from birth, rank, title, or wealth.</p>
<p>No one yet addresses workers as “fellow managers”—I hope no one ever
will. Yet this is the goal. There will be—and there has to be—the
reality of management power and authority, of command and of
decision-making, of higher and lower incomes, of superior and
subordinate. But there also is the task of building and leading
organizations in which every man sees himself as a “manager” and accepts
for himself the full burden of what is basically managerial
responsibility: responsibility for his own job and work group, for his
contribution to the performance and results of the entire organization,
and for the social tasks of the work community.</p>

<p>Ljob and</p>
<p>fear of loss of job and income is incompatible with taking
responsibility for work group, for output and performance. That the fear
is becoming less per-</p>
<p>vasive—to the point where it no longer acts as a spur—makes it all
the more destruc- tive. It contrasts so sharply with the standard of
living and the standard of security to which most workers in a developed
society have become accustomed.</p>
<p>To accept the burden of responsibility, the worker—the unskilled as
well as the skilled worker, and the manual as well as the knowledge
worker—needs a fair measure of secu- rity of job and income.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the worker needs also mobility. Every
worker needs to be able to escape the wrong job. Every worker needs to
be able to move from a dying com- pany or industry into one that grows
or at least into one that has a chance for survival. And the knowledge
worker, especially the highly educated one, needs to be able to move
where his skill and knowledge can make the greatest contribution. To
leave knowledge skill underutilized is impoverishment of society and
individual alike.</p>
<p>The economy also needs a fair degree of labor-cost flexibility, and
so does every busi- ness. The widespread belief that wages take the main
brunt of economic fluctuation is, of course, nonsense. The main burden
is carried by the capital fund—as it should be. In a bad year profits go
down sharply or disappear. But the share of wage incomes in total
revenue—whether of the economy or of a business—actually goes up sharply
in recession years. Capital costs, in other words are the least fixed
costs of an economy despite the accountant’s contrary terminology. And
labor costs are the most nearly fixed costs of an economy or of a
business. But there is still need for flexibility, still need for
relating wage costs to the level of economic activity, to the other
costs of an economy, to the profit re- quirements of the capital fund,
and to productivity.</p>
<p>Finally there is need to assuage the conflict between wage fund and
capital fund. It cannot be eliminated. But there is need for some
mechanism that establishes a tie between the two, both to make visible
the worker’s long-term stake in the capital fund and to en- able him to
understand the function of profit and profitability.</p>
<p>There is nothing very new to these requirements. In different ways
different econo- mies and different businesses have been struggling with
them all along. But managements have, by and large, not managed
employment, incomes, and benefits. They have reacted and adapted. These
are, however, areas of genuine managerial responsibility. These are
management tasks.</p>
<p>Job Security and Income Stability</p>
<p>That workers resist higher productivity and innovative changes is a
very old theme. The cloth workers of Florence in the days of the
Renaissance rioted against new technology as a threat to their jobs.</p>
<p>But the resistance of workers on all levels against higher
productivity and against in- novation is not based solely on the fear of
working oneself out of one’s own job. Equally important is the fear that
the achieving worker will work other workers out of their jobs. As a
result, group pressure is brought into play against the worker who, by
wanting to achieve, becomes a threat to the security of his fellow
workers.</p>
<p>Resistance to change and resistance to innovation are not inherent in
human nature.</p>
<p>The Japanese experience proves this. And wherever a Western business
has provided comparable job and income security, resistance to change or
to innovation has disap- peared.</p>
<p>This was the experience of Zeiss in the last century, as it has been
the experience of IBM in the twenty-five years after World War II.</p>
<p>Another example is Krupp in Germany, where workers were, until
recently, assured of lifetime employment and where resistance to change
and innovation were virtually un- known. This in large measure explains
the ability of Krupp, for long periods of time, to hold a leadership
position in the steel fabricating industry on the European
continent.</p>
<p>Similarly, Marks andandandand Spencer in England, while having no
formal job guarantees, does, in effect, provide stable and practically
guaranteed employment—and again there is no resistance to change or to
innovation.</p>
<p>That resistance to change has its origin in fear of loss of job is
proved by a Japanese example. For not all Japanese industry is receptive
to change.</p>
<p>A significant exception is the Japanese National Railways. Workers on
the railways have guaranteed employment security, and yet they are
haunted by the fear of job loss. For everybody in Japan, and especially
the railway employee himself, knows that the railways are grossly
overstaffed. Any change in work rules, in procedures, in regulations,
threatens to expose the basic redundancy and excess manpower of the
system. Every such change is, therefore, bitterly resisted and, in fact,
prevented by the employees. And Japa- nese railway workers, while
probably the best-paid workers in Japan, have the worst and most bitter
industrial relations with their employer, the government.</p>
<p>It is not, in other words, just legal or contractual guarantees of
job and income that are needed. To give the worker the security he needs
to take responsibility, there must be reality to the promise. To keep
people on the payroll for whom there is no job may create insecurity as
great as actual loss of job. What is needed is not just the guarantee of
in- come, but a system which actively end systematically provides work,
that is, productive membership in society.</p>
<p>In the West a formal guarantee of jobs and incomes is the exception
rather than the rule—though I have, I believe, given enough examples to
show that the exceptions are far more numerous than most people (and
practically all union leaders) believe. But job secu- rity and income
assurance have increasingly been built into this system.</p>
<p>The first step was unemployment compensation. But on top of this
individual compa- nies and individual industries, with or without union
contracts, have developed a multi- tude of provisions: supplemental
unemployment compensation; severance pay; and sen- iority rules in
layoffs which, in effect, give older employees practical job
security.</p>
<p>As a result, labor costs in the West have, in effect, become more and
more inflexible.</p>
<p>They may today, at least in basic industries, be less flexible than
the labor costs of Japan. A U.S. employer in mass-production industry
can lay off employees fairly easily— certainly far more easily than a
Japanese, or even a European employer could. But he is then committed to
severance pay, to high supplementary unemployment compensation payments,
and to other burdens which in effect mean that he still keeps on paying
some- thing like three-quarters or more of the laid-off worker’s wages
for something like from six to nine months.</p>
<p>At the same time, Western labor forces, at least compared to the
Japanese, have fairly high mobility. Knowledge workers, in particular,
can and do move easily from one em- ployer to another.</p>
<p>There is, even in the U.S., a belief that American workers, and
especially knowledge people, change jobs all the time. But with respect
to managers and professionals this is largely myth.</p>
<p>In the large—and in most small—American companies actual turnover is
quite low among managers and professionals. There is considerable
turnover in the entrance jobs, that is, in the first three to five years
of a man’s employment. There is considerable turn- over—considerably
more than used to be common in Europe, let alone Japan—in top management
jobs. In between, though—among older workers, lower and middle man-
agement, and among professional and technical knowledge workers—job
change is the exception rather than the rule. In every large American
company the great majority of the middle ranks are filled with people
who have at most changed jobs once, and that within a few years after
their graduation from college. Their first job change, made when they
were still quite young, is usually their last one. After that they may
move geographically from one location of the company to another, but
they very rarely change employers. There is almost no difference in
length of service and in career patterns between manage- rial,
professional, and technical people in an American large company and in a
European company, say, between General Electric and Siemens. There is
not even tremendous dif- ference in the middle ranks and in the age
group between the late twenties and the late fifties, between the
typical large American company and the Japanese company.</p>
<p>Job stability is also the rule rather than the exception for
blue-collar workers in the U.S. A good measure of this is the experience
of the private pension plans in American industry which cover virtually
all large- and medium-sized enterprises (and probably a majority of
small businesses as well). These plans are under sharp attack these days
be- cause “only 70 percent of the employees actually receive a pension.”
This is indeed a se- rious shortcoming and needs to be remedied—by
earlier “vesting” of pension rights, for instance, and by making them
“portable,” that is, transferable from one employer to an- other. But
the problem arises because in most U.S. pension plans eligibility is
conditional upon working for the same employer twenty-five to thirty
years. Two-thirds of the work force, in other words, have what is in
effect lifetime employment—a far larger proportion, by the way, than in
Japan. The “average” job mobility of the U.S. worker is indeed high. But
again the great bulk of the turnover, as in the case of managers and
professionals, is in the very early years, when many young people change
jobs two or even three times a year. After they have worked for five or
six years, have married, and have begun to raise a family, they tend to
stop moving—and soon acquire enough seniority to have substantial job
security.</p>
<p>The Shortcomings</p>
<p>Economically (in terms of total labor costs and incomes) the
developed countries bave arrived at a high degree of employment security
and income stability. And yet both “mod- els,” the American-European and
the Japanese, have serious shortcomings.</p>
<p>The American-European system may actually, as said before, have less
flexibility of labor costs than the Japanese. But psychologically the
fear persists. Income stability is least assured when the worker needs
it the most, that is, when his children are small and when he may have
old parents to support. For then he has comparatively low seniority.
There is also no true “system” but rather a confused mess of ad hoc
improvisations. As a result, the individual case is almost
unpredictable. One man may actually have all but complete income
security even for prolonged periods of unemployment or sickness. An-
other man may have little or none.</p>
<p>Mobility is available in the West (though by no means
unrestricted—there are very real obstacles, especially in the form of
union restrictions and demarcations that close access to crafts and jobs
to newcomers). But information on job opportunities, except in a</p>
<p>few areas of knowledge work, is scarce. Statistically, the danger of
long-term unemploy- ment is very small (except in a genuine depression
in an economy, industry, or isolated geographic region). But the
individual sees no pattern. The fear of being out of a job therefore
remains.</p>
<p>diminished uncertainty and with it fear. But nothing comparable
exists in most countries for rank-and-file workers and clerks.</p>
<p>The Japanese system gives to employees in Japan’s “modern”
organizations a high degree of psychological security. But its lack of
mobility is a weakness, and one that will become increasingly serious.
It commits Japan to maintenance of employment in yester- day’s
industries while it starves tomorrow’s industries, especially in a
period—such as the 1970s and 1980s—when the supply of new workers will
shrink because of population changes. The restriction on mobility is
becoming increasingly irksome to young, highly qualified knowledge
people. They also increasingly become economic waste as highly qualified
people—e.g., engineers, computer experts, and accountants—cannot move
where their knowledge would make the greatest contribution but are
forced to stay put even if there is little real work for them. And with
the center of gravity of the work force shifting to knowledge workers
even faster in Japan than in the West as a result of the edu- cation
explosion, this threatens to become an increasing impairment.</p>
<p>The Rehn Plan</p>
<p>The Swedish experience shows that these shortcomings are not
preordained either by eco- nomic or by social “laws.” The Swedish system
was devised by a union leader, Goesta Rehn, in the early fifties. Rehn
realized that Sweden had to change industrial and eco- nomic structure
and had to shrink traditional low-technology and low-productivity indus-
try. At the same time, he realized that the worker had to be given
security. Under the Swedish system—in sharp contrast to that favored in
most other Western countries— industries and companies are not being
encouraged to maintain employment. On the con- trary, they are being
encouraged to anticipate any redundancy in employment that might result
from technological development or economic change. At the same time
businesses and industries are expected to anticipate future needs for
additional workers and their skills. This information is fed to the Rehn
Board, a semi-governmental, semiprivate or- ganization in which
government, employers, and labor unions work together. The Board</p>
<p>then underwrites the income of the redundant employee. It trains him.
It finds a new job for him and places him in it. If necessary it moves
him to a new location and pays for the move.</p>
<p>The Rehn Plan explains in large measure the economic transformation
of Sweden. As late as 1950 Sweden was still almost an underdeveloped
country for most of her popula- tion. The bulk of the labor force was
employed in low-productivity and low-income activ- ity. Twenty years
later Sweden had become one of the technological leaders of the world
with a living standard second only to that of the United States. A
larger proportion of the work force than in any other country, including
Japan, has moved from one kind of em- ployment to another, with a
minimum of disruption, with almost no resistance to change, and with
extraordinary willingness to acquire new skills and to learn new
things.</p>
<p>The Swedish example shows that, even in a major economic shift,
insecurity of jobs and income is not a very big problem. The fear is
real and paralyzing. But the problem itself, in statistical terms, is
marginal.</p>
<p>A Swedish trade union leader who at first opposed the Rehn Plan (as
he told me) found the perfect analogy: “Remember,” he said, “when every
mother was scared stiff of polio every summer? Yet, statistically polio
was a very minor risk, far less than that of any other illness around.
All of us were as afraid of unemployment and job loss as moth- ers used
to be of polio. The fear paralyzed us. And the reason was exactly the
same as that</p>
<p>which made mothers panic at the very thought of polio. Every case,
however rare, was unpredictable, mysterious and catastrophe.”</p>
<p>Sweden, under the Rehn Plan, took responsibility for the worker way
beyond what even the Japanese do. Yet the expense was marginal. In fact,
Sweden—despite very high unemployment compensation—pays probably less
for the maintenance of jobs and in- comes than does American industry
under its various supplementary compensation and severance plans.</p>
<p>Needed: Organized Placement</p>
<p>We need to make explicit the actuality of high job security and (in
the West) even higher income stability. In the West we need also to
build in the Japanese relationship between income assurance and the need
for income security of different groups, especially with respect lo
stages in a family’s life cycle. The Japanese, in turn, will surely have
to develop mobility, especially for the knowledge worker.</p>
<p>But in addition, job security and employment stability require
organized placement ac- tivity. The cost is almost insignificant. But
lacking systematic placement, the employer will be “frozen in.” He will
not be able to reduce employment—or at least labor costs. Yet there will
still be fear and insecurity unless the employer takes active
responsibility, one way or another, for placing employees who have to be
let go. Wherever an employer has accepted the commitment to finding a
job for redundant workers, the result has been psychological security.
Examples abound: Zeiss again led the way. While Zeiss had em- ployment
security through periods of minor economic fluctuations, it did
experience oc- casional truly poor years. And there was a fair amount of
technological redundancy de- spite continuous learning. Then Zeiss tried
to place the men whose jobs were being abol- ished—and rarely had any
difficulty finding for them at least as good a job as they had had at
Zeiss.</p>
<p>A more recent example is a major American manufacturer of glass and
plastic con- tainers which, for many years, and without any formal
announcement, has considered it the employer’s duty to find jobs for
people who because of technological or economic change become
redundant—whether they are rank-and-file manual workers, clerical
workers, professionals, or managers. The number of people who have to be
placed is rea- sonably small in any one year. In most cases the manager
of the unit, with the help of people in the personnel department, can
place the handful of “problem cases” easily and within his own locality.
Once in a while it becomes necessary to retrain a man at company
expense. And once in a while it becomes necessary to give a man early
retirement with a fairly substantial pension. Over the years the program
has cost almost nothing in that company workers are willing to take a
very high degree of responsibility for their own jobs and their own
achievement. And resistance to technological change and to higher
productivity is minimal.</p>
<p>A very different example is that of a major worldwide management
consulting firm.</p>
<p>Professional employees have no employment security the first three to
five years. They are on probation, and turnover is fairly high. Men who
last beyond this probationary pe- riod and become consultants will, it
is clearly understood, not be kept on the payroll past age thirty-eight
or forty unless they are accepted by the group as full partners. Only
one out of every six or seven therefore stays on past forty. Yet there
is no fear in the group, no demand for job or income security. For the
firm, without legal commitment, undertakes to place everyone who has
passed the probationary period but then does not qualify within the
ensuing ten years for full partnership. The senior partners themselves
do most of the placement through their personal acquaintances throughout
world business. Every junior knows that he will be asked in all
probability to leave the firm just when he needs job and income the
most, that is, at a time when his family needs are greatest. Yet he is
not very much concerned. He knows that the firm will take responsibility
for placing him and, with it, for maintaining, if not improving, his
income.</p>
<p>The Swedish system would clearly not work in a major economic
depression. Nor would any other, including the Japanese system. But a
major economic depression is a rare event, and people know then that
there is no protection and do not expect miracles.</p>
<p>The basic problem in job and income security is not general
catastrophe. It is the im- pact on the individual of minor changes,
technological advances which obsolete one com- pany, one industry, or
one craft; improvements in productivity which lead to a cutting back of
the labor force required; minor shifts in economic demands; in
transportation economics, in product line, or in process. Statistically
these are marginal events. For the individual they are “polio.”</p>
<p>This is no longer a problem of money. The money is being spent to
provide job secu- rity and income stability. The need now is, first—in
the West, in particular—to make ex- plicit, overt, and visible the
security that exists. And second, as the Swedes have shown, the mobility
which economy, enterprise, and worker require needs to be organized.
What is needed, in other words, is a little intelligence and some hard
work.</p>
<p>Profits, Productivity, and Benefits</p>
<p>The job as a living is the worker’s first concern with respect to the
economic dimension of working. But there is also the apparent conflict
between wage fund and capital fund, that is, between the worker’s
economic interest in wage and salary and the need of economy and
enterprise (and ultimately of workers) for profits and productivity.</p>
<p>In the United States, at least, this conflict should by now be moot
and a thing of the past. For increasingly in the American economy, the
worker is the beneficiary of both the wage fund and the capital
fund.</p>
<p>Increasingly American industry—at least the large and middle-sized
American busi- ness—is being “owned” for the employees’ benefit by the
trustees of the employees. By 1990—or at the latest by the year 2000—the
pension funds and the mutual funds (and most shareholders in mutual
funds are low- and middle-income employees) will own be- tween
two-thirds and three-quarters or more of the large and medium-sized
businesses of America. Already by now, that is, in the early 1970s,
these trustees of the workers have become the largest single group of
shareholders and owners in the American economy. They are the only true
“capitalists” around.</p>
<p>Yet the fact that worker and shareowner are becoming one and the same
person seems to have very little impact, if any, on the hostility to
profit. Even total worker ownership and the elimination of all outside
owners does not have much impact, it seems.</p>
<p>One large American company that is totally employee-owned is United
Parcel Service (which has, in effect, replaced the U.S. Post Office as
the main provider of parcel post services throughout the country). Yet,
United Parcel has for years plagued by labor trou- bles. The employees
clearly do not identify themselves with the “bosses” against whom they
strike.</p>
<p>On a much larger scale Yugoslavia teaches the same lesson. All larger
businesses in Yugoslavia are owned by their workers, with an elected
workers’ council the enterprise’s governing organ. Yet, no Yugoslav
management has reported any pressure from the own- ers for higher
profits. On the contrary, managements have to fight for adequate profits
against worker resistance. The constant demand is for lower profits and
higher wages, to the point where the Yugoslav experiment of
worker-ownership of industry is seriously being endangered by wage
inflation.</p>
<p>The most curious case is probably Japan. The employees of the
company, especially of the large, modern one, are the only true owners.
Since an employee, whether rank-and- file worker or executive
vice-president, cannot be fired, as a rule, the enterprise is actually
run for the employees. They are the “beneficial owners,” in legal (or
economic) terms. And since they cannot find a job elsewhere as a rule,
the employees have an overriding self-interest in the survival and
prosperity of the company that employs them. In the West, it used to be
said that “all the worker owns is his capacity to work.” In Japan he
does not even own that; his only real property is the welfare of his
company. Yet in no other coun-</p>
<p>try is resistance to profits so great. Indeed one is told again and
again that for “us Japa- nese” profit is a dirty word and synonymous
with exploitation.</p>
<p>The worker-owner who resists profits and rejects the needs of the
capital fund is, however, not altogether irrational. And to explain his
resistance as the result of “socialist agitation,” as conservatives have
done for a hundred years, is fatuous.</p>
<p>The main reason is simply that profit is too small in relation to
wage and salary to tilt the balance for the worker-owner. This is
particularly true in the society of organizations where most working
people are employees on a wage or a salary. Wage and salary income of
employees in such a society is about two-thirds of a country’s total
personal income, after-tax profits a scant 5 or 6 percent. The real
property of the employee, in other words, and the income on which he
depends, is his job. Profit—even if he gets all of it—is a fringe
benefit, and not a very big one. Rational behavior for the employee is
clearly to maximize wage and salary income, even at the expense of his
own share in profits.</p>
<p>A second—but not secondary—explanation is that plans which pay out
profit shares or productivity shares as income, are, of necessity,
fair-weather plans. They work well as long as profits and productivity
go up. They create resentment and frustration the moment profit shares
and productivity bonuses no longer go up but go down. And, in any given
year, two-fifths of the businesses in any economy do not have a profit
but operate at a loss.</p>
<p>It is basic fallacy to treat profit as income. Profit is capital
fund, that is, savings. Only if used to build a capital fund for the
worker can it have meaning. Only then can the func- tion of profit even
be understood.</p>
<p>Wherever profit as, capital fund has been structured as an employee
benefit, the im- pact has been great. In some cases the resistance to
profit almost completely disappeared.</p>
<p>One example—admittedly an atypical one—is the Sears, Roebuck
profit-sharing pen- sion fund. There is a clear relationship between
company profits and a major need of the employee namely, retirement
pensions. There is a clear link between the profitability of the company
and the size of the pension which a retiring employee will receive. To
be sure, Sears has been a singularly profitable company so that its plan
has been a bonanza for long-serving employees. But it is also reasonable
to assume that the employee’s knowledge that the company’s profitability
meant a larger retirement pension for him may have had something to do
with the company’s profitability. Employees on all levels, from the very
lowest on up, and including members of militant unions, have been
willing to contribute to profits and willing to accept increased company
profitability as objective for themselves.</p>
<p>The Sears example, as also the Zeiss example, would indicate that
benefits are the area in which a meaningful link between company
profitability and worker needs can be at- tempted. In the benefit areas
the individual employee builds up his capital fund. He needs certainty
with respect to his expectations and provision against risk. At the same
time, individual certainty can be provided in many benefit areas on the
basis of a probability distribution, that is, at a fairly low cost per
individual.</p>
<p>One of these areas is the risk of survival, that is, the need for
some retirement provi- sion. With present life expectancy, survival to
retirement has become the great probabil- ity. If spread over enough
years and over a large enough group, the certainty of adequate
retirement income can be financed by a fairly low annual payment per
individual covered. Another such area where there is need for certainty
of benefits is health care. The individ- ual economic risk goes beyond
anything even the rich can carry. But there is a probability
distribution which makes collective coverage reasonably cheap. Finally,
there is job and income security, again a risk of catastrophe for the
individual, but, on a probability basis, a fairly low group risk.</p>
<p>These are benefits which can be provided for out of fluctuating
profits. In any one year the contribution to a retirement fund, a health
plan, or a job and income maintenance fund can fluctuate. What matters
is that the provision be adequate over a three- to ten-year period, that
is, that low contributions in one year be compensated for by higher
contribu- tions in another more profitable year.</p>
<p>Making “Benefits” Benefit</p>
<p>But to be effective, benefit plans, however generous, will have to be
restructured.</p>
<p>There is no lack of fringe benefits in developed countries. They have
grown like weeds. They began to develop around 1920. Since then two
systems have come into be- ing.</p>
<p>One is the Japanese system where benefits are highly selective. They
are focused on the needs of individual groups and individuals. There is
no systematic plan, as a rule. The individual has no rights. Employer
contributions to benefits are not made according to actuarial
projections, generally, but according to the needs of the moment.</p>
<p>In the West, benefits have developed into highly structured rights
with rigid plans. By and large, there is flexibility neither in
contribution nor in beneficiary. The employer pays a certain fixed
amount per employee. And all employees regardless of age, sex, skill,
and so on, receive exactly the same benefits, absolutely or in
proportion to salary, whether they fit their major needs or not.</p>
<p>Both systems have made the worker, in effect, the major recipient of
profits, that is, the major recipient of, and conduit for, the capital
fund. For provisions for workers’ re- tirement or for workers’ education
are capital investments rather than wages, at least in economic terms.
Yet neither system is adequate to either the needs of the worker or the
needs of enterprise and economy.</p>
<p>One basic weakness of the Western system is that it lacks
selectivity. Every group in the work force gets the same benefits
whether they truly benefit the group or not. As a result, no group gets
in full the benefits that would mean the most for it. And every group
gets benefits which it does not truly need and therefore does not
greatly value, but for which it pays, of course, one way or another.</p>
<p>A reason for this is the pervasive belief of employees—on all
levels—that there are “free benefits.” If the employer pays for them,
many employees believe they do not cost anything. The labor unions are
among the foremost victims of this particular delusion. Needless to say,
there are no free benefits. All benefits are part of the cost of
enterprise and economy. Since some two-thirds of personal income in
every developed society is wages and salaries (which does not include
the incomes of farmers, small shopkeepers, and independent
professionals) there is no one but the recipients of wages and salaries
who could possibly pay for benefits.</p>
<p>Another reason why benefits in the West are not structured to give
the most benefit to the recipient is the belief of the labor unions that
what costs the enterprise the most is thereby of most benefit for the
employee. The labor union measures the value of benefits by how much
they “hurt” enterprise.</p>
<p>In addition, most benefits in the West are not related to the
performance of the enter- prise—or at least, not in visible form. They
are fixed. What is needed, however, are plans that have a “floor” with
contributions actually determined though fluctuating from year to year
according to the company’s profits and productivity. But there needs to
be no “ceil- ing.” Extraordinary profitability or productivity might, as
at Sears, Roebuck, make possi- ble sizable increases in benefit levels
without creating a permanent burden.</p>
<p>The Japanese system provides probably greater worker satisfaction
with a lower bur- den on enterprise and economy. This is a result of its
selectivity, that is, of its ability to tailor the benefits of one group
or one employee to specific needs. But at the same time, the Japanese
system is arbitrary. Management decides what is good for the employee.
There is no plan and little predictability. As a result, there is
increasing pressure in Japan for clear, agreed-upon contractual plans,
that is, for the Western approach.</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese system does even less than the Western
system to relate benefits to profitability and productivity. In Japan,
far more than in the West, employee benefits are capital investment: a
small dowry for the woman worker upon her marriage; housing built by the
employer or low-interest mortgage loans to enable the employee to build
his own home; the two-year salary that still serves as retirement
payment for most workers. Yet this capital fund for the worker is rarely
related to the enterprise’s or the</p>
<p>economy’s capital fund, that is, to profitability or rising
productivity. In the West most employees know—if only vaguely—that a
declining business will cut back on benefits. Whenever that happens in
Japan, it seems to come as a tremendous shock and surprise.</p>
<p>What Benefits Should Be</p>
<p>It is not surprising that benefits yield so little of their potential
benefit. Almost no benefit plan anywhere in the world was planned,
designed, thought through. Practically all of them just grew. Indeed,
Americans still call them “fringes”—even though benefits are a little
more than a quarter of the total labor cost of American business, which
is somewhat wide for a fringe. And in Europe, let alone in Japan, this
fringe is even wider.</p>
<p>In most businesses, Western or Japanese, benefits are the third
largest cost next to wages and materials. Yet while individual benefit
programs, e.g., the retirement plan or the health-care plan, are
managed, the benefit system essentially unmanaged. To leave so large a
cost center unmanaged is poor management. And far more is at stake in
benefits than cost. It is high time that management assume true
managerial responsibility for bene- fits.</p>
<p>We can specify what benefits should be and should do.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Benefits need to be structured so as to give the beneficiary, the
worker, the most for the money.</li>
</ol>
<p>A good example of what not to do is America’s most widely used health
insurance plan, the nonprofit Blue Cross Plan which is particularly
popular with labor unions. Blue Cross health coverage has become
increasingly expensive. Yet it does not provide for payment of medical
and hospital bills when the worker needs it the most, that is, when he
is out of work. But it pays full expenses for the minor illnesses of his
family while he is employed—which is a major reason for the high
premium. Yet an employed worker in the United States earns more than
enough to pay for minor illnesses of his nonworking family members. A 00
“deductible” for medical costs of nonworking dependents would pay for
substantial medical cost coverage for up to two years of unemployment.
This would be of far greater benefit to the insured than reimbursement
for sums which he can easily pay when employed and working.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>The floor of benefits needs to be fixed. But it should be
financed on a fluctuating basis with a clear relationship to
profitability and perhaps to productivity, and higher benefits
(especially retirement benefits) in the event of extraordinary
profitability and productivity gains. There needs to be a minimum
contribution on the part of the employer. And any deficiency in the
benefit fund must be made up on a regular periodic basis. But the more
flexibility the employer has, the greater his contribution can be. At
the same time, the closer and more visible the relationship is between
benefits and a company’s profits, the more will benefits help to
attenuate the conflict between wage fund and capital fund.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of individual benefits programs, each with its own
contribution, it might be well to decide first the total size of the
benefit package and then work out options to give to each group the
combination of benefits that best serves its needs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There need to be safeguards, of course. I would imagine that no
worker would be al- lowed to opt out of health insurance. But a worker
might be given the option between a health insurance plan that
reimburses him in full for all medical and hospital expenses for himself
and his family, and one in which he pays for the first few hundred
dollars of medical expenses each year out of his own pocket. That would
enable him to increase the contribution to his pension plan or to get
low-interest loans for the college expenses of his children or for
building a house.</p>
<p>I, personally, would go much further. I would strongly favor plans
under which work- ers are entitled to cut their cash wage, up to a
substantial percentage, to improve their benefits. In the West, where
younger workers (unlike Japan) are paid essentially the same as older
men doing similar work, a younger worker who does not yet have
substantial family obligations or mortgage payments on a house might be
encouraged, for instance, to</p>
<p>withhold a share of his cash earnings to be put into his retirement
annuity. After all, a dollar paid into an annuity account at age
twenty-five buys a great deal more than a dollar paid into the same
account twenty years later.</p>
<p>Wherever plans of this kind have been offered, they have met with
tremendous re- sponse, both on the part of younger workers in general
and especially on the part of knowledge workers of all ages. Examples
are some stock purchase plans and savings plans of American companies.
The Internal Revenue Service has encouraged such a plan for some
employees of nonprofit institutions such as college professors who can
withhold a substantial part of their salary to be invested in their
retirement pension, with the income taxable only when received, that is,
after retirement and presumably at a much lower rate. This plan has been
chosen by a very large proportion of the men eligible under it— proving
that it makes sense to a great many workers to manage cash incomes and
benefits as one income stream.</p>
<p>At the same time we might give workers at certain stages of their
family life the option to take down part of the benefit money as
additional cash wage. This would be bitterly fought by the labor unions,
since it would create what labor unions fear the most: unequal cash
wages for equal work (though total actual income; i.e., cash wages plus
benefits, would of course remain the same). But it would make sense,
especially if the same worker has earlier, that is, before the time of
heavy family obligations, withheld part of his cash income and put the
money into benefits.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The administration of benefits should as much as possible be made a
responsibility of the work community.</li>
</ol>
<p>Investing pension-fund money requires high professional skill. And so
does running a mortgage bank for employee housing. But the work
community needs to participate, if only to learn. And it should be
primarily responsible for the design of benefit programs and benefit
options for various groups in the work force. No one else knows what the
true needs are. No one else can convince the work force that choices
have to be made and that the available options represent the best
balance of choices.</p>
<p>Workers the world over have shown two strong preferences as incomes
went up.</p>
<p>One is the preference for leisure over more cash income. What part of
the added pro- ductivity of a modern economy is taken in the form of
leisure rather than in the form of cash income is hard to compute. But
at all levels (except the top) workers clearly consider leisure a major
employee benefit.</p>
<p>The second preference has been for benefits. This is a rational
preference. Retirement pensions and life insurance protection; medical
and health care; housing and education, are all values which are best
procured on a collective basis, that is, on the basis of cer- tainty for
the recipient and probability distribution of risk and cost. And these
are the val- ues which loom the larger the more basic economic needs are
satisfied.</p>
<p>Benefits, one can predict, are likely to continue to be a major
worker demand and a major worker need. Benefits are, therefore, likely
to become a larger rather than a smaller part of the labor costs of an
economy. At the same time, they become increasingly the channel through
which the capital fund is being fed. It is, therefore, incumbent on man-
agement to assume responsibility for employee benefits. It is no longer
adequate to con- sider them fringes, as managements do in the West, or
benevolence, as managements do in Japan.</p>

<p>E</p>
<p>VERYTHING DISCUSSED in the preceding chapter for years. Everything
has actually been practiced in a</p>
<p>of this section has been known good many companies, if only</p>
<p>in bits and pieces rather than systematically. Wherever tried, these
approaches have worked and have made for stronger and more prosperous
institutions, and for stronger management.</p>
<p>Managements everywhere have nodded with approval when learning or
reading about these approaches. Yet few managements have acted. Only now
when major shifts in work, work group, and working threaten to make
ineffectual both carrot and stick are manage- ments willing to pay more
than lip service.</p>
<p>What explains this resistance, this unwillingness to learn from such
eminently respect- able and successful examples as, for instance, Zeiss
and IBM?</p>
<p>The first, and in many ways the main, reason for the reluctance of
managers to face up to the problem of making the worker achieving is a
confusion of power with authority in managerial minds. Managers resist
as abdication of authority the demand for worker re- sponsibility,
whether on the part of the manual worker on the shop floor or of the
knowl- edge professional. They see their authority undermined by “giving
up power.”</p>
<p>Japanese managements can hardly be accused of having abdicated. They
have more authority than managements in the West. Not can IBM be accused
of having abdicated. Indeed, the main criticism of IBM by “liberals” for
many years has been that IBM is in effect a tyranny. And Zeiss was
anything but permissive and operated under strict disci- pline.</p>
<p>Power and authority are two different things. Management has no
power. Management has only responsibility. And it needs and must have
the authority to discharge its respon- sibilities—but not one whit
more.</p>
<p>American managements still sometimes invoke “management
prerogatives,” espe- cially to resist union demands. This is a
singularly unfortunate phrase. A prerogative is a privilege of rank.
Management has no claim to any such privilege. It exists to discharge a
function. Its job is to make productive the resources in its trust. A
prerogative is never based on responsibility or contribution—originally
the word was used to denote “divine right.” And even the most autocratic
management is unlikely to claim divine right. Man- agement has authority
only as long as it performs.</p>
<p>To invoke management prerogatives undermines managerial authority.
Managements who refuse to demand responsibility from the members of the
organization are actually losing necessary authority, especially to the
labor union and to government.</p>
<p>Managers of business are by no means alone in their confusion of
power with author- ity. Indeed, managers of business, by and large, have
been more willing to work on build- ing an achieving work force than
managers of public-service institutions. The government agency and the
hospital have been even more reluctant to make their workers
responsible, have even more depended on prerogatives rather than on the
authority appropriate to their responsibilities. As a result, they have
actually lost true and needed authority, are even more hedged in by
restraints and restrictions, and have even greater difficulty mobilizing
the human resources of their organizations.</p>
<p>The Lesson of Decentralization</p>
<p>This is not the first time that managements have suffered from this
confusion of authority with power, to their detriment and that of their
organizations. A similar confusion was common a few decades ago, with
respect to organization structure.</p>
<p>There was considerable resistance to decentralization in the forties
and fifties. It was widely feared that it would weaken top management
and would indeed lead to “top man- agement abdication.”</p>
<p>By now managers everywhere have learned that decentralization
strengthens top man- agement. It makes it more effective and more
capable of doing its own tasks. It results in greater authority for top
management (on this see Chapter 46).</p>
<p>Similarly, the Japanese managers, IBM, or, much earlier even, Zeiss,
learned that to make the worker achieving strengthens management’s
authority. It makes management more effective by enabling it to focus on
the tasks which management needs to perform and to relieve itself of
those tasks which management need not perform, does poorly, and spends
far too much time on if loaded down with them.*</p>
<p>Responsible worker, responsible work group, and self-governing work
community are decentralization. What is being decentralized is not
business management, it is work man-</p>
<p>agement. But the principle is similar. And just as decentralization
was the main thrust in the years of the management boom, so the
responsible worker should be central to the years of management
performance ahead.</p>
<p>Responsibility built into the work force from top to bottom is
needed, above all, to re- verse the erosion of management authority
which is a threat to the functioning of man- agement and of our
institutions altogether. Carrot and stick no longer suffice. But nothing
has truly taken their place. As a result there is an authority vacuum.
It is most noticeable among the knowledge workers in business, in the
government agency, and in the other service institutions. Its symptom is
cynicism—a more dangerous disease than rebellion against authority. The
only way to counteract it and to restore management’s authority is to
demand responsibility of each member of the work force.</p>
<p>The Demands on Management</p>
<p>There was a second reason why top managements twenty years ago
resisted decentraliza- tion. They feared the high demands it makes on
top management. And a similar fear also explains the resistance of
managers to worker and work-community responsibility.</p>
<p>A responsible work force does indeed make very high demands on
managers. It de- mands that they be truly competent—and competent as
managers rather than as psycholo- gists or psychotherapists. It demands
that they take their own work seriously. It demands that they themselves
take responsibility for their jobs and their performances.</p>
<p>Responsibility is harsh taskmaster. To demand it of others without
demanding it of oneself is futile and irresponsible. The worker cannot
assume the burden of responsibility for his own job, work group, and
work-community affairs unless he can be confident of the seriousness,
responsibility, and competence of his company. He must be able to have
confidence that the boss knows his own job and work. He must take it for
granted that the</p>
<p>*This is brought out clearly in the book of Shigeru Kobayashi of Sony
Corp., Creative Management (American Management Association, 1971).</p>
<p>boss provides the tools the worker himself needs to be able to do
productive work and the information the worker needs to direct and
control himself.</p>
<p>Nothing quenches motivation as quickly as a slovenly boss. People
expect and de- mand that managers enable them to do a good job and work
productively and intelli- gently. People have indeed a right to expect a
serious and competent superior.</p>
<p>In Japanese companies industrial engineers, as has been said before,
do not complain about workers resistance. Rather they tend to complain
that workers demand too much of them. The Japanese work force, which
holds itself responsible for production, rightly ex- pects the people on
whom it depends for its “tools,” that is, for the understanding of work
and process, to perform to exacting standards.</p>
<p>People do not expect perfection. They know that the boss is also a
human being. But people who take responsibility for their own work
demand that managers do what they are being paid for: that they plan;
that they set objectives and think through priorities; that they think
through assignments and set standards. Above all, they expect that the
manager take responsibility for his own work and performance.</p>
<p>Napoleon has been called many things, but “likable” is not one of
them. The “great leader” is rarely “warm”; a good many have been icy. He
is not often “outgoing” or “affa- ble”; he tends to be austere and
aloof. He has little “empathy”; he makes demands. A good many have had
not a trace of charisma. But a leader always inspires confidence, always
commands respect.</p>
<p>It has been said, and only half in jest, that a tough, professionally
led union is a great force for improving management performance. It
forces the manager to think through what he is doing and to be able to
explain his actions and behavior.</p>
<p>A responsible work force is an even more stringent discipline. It
brings into the open the positive dissatisfactions within the group, all
the desires to do a better job, all the im- patience with bumbling,
laziness, petty restraints, and lame excuses. But unlike a union, an
achieving work force is does not exert its pressure as an adversary. It
exerts it in coop- eration. It “plays on the same team.” But for this
reason it expects team captains and team leaders, that is, managers, to
hold themselves to high standards and to take their own jobs
seriously.</p>
<p>The Leadership of People</p>
<p>Finally, to make the worker “achieve” demands that managers look upon
labor as a re- source rather than as a problem, a cost, or an enemy to
be cowed It demands that manag- ers accept responsibility for making
human strengths effective. And this means a drastic shift from personnel
management to the leadership of people.</p>
<p>There are three traditional approaches to managing people. There is
the welfare ap- proach, which sees people as problems which need help.
There is the personnel manage- ment approach, which sees activities and
chores to be performed whenever large numbers of people have to work
together. Third is the approach which sees labor as a cost and as a
threat and sees the job in controlling cost and in fighting
“crises.”</p>
<p>People are indeed “problems.” And people do need help. The welfare
approach can be highly effective, especially in managing people who
truly are helpless.</p>
<p>The best example, at least in the West, is the House of Krupp. Alfred
Krupp, who built the firm in the middle of the nineteenth century, was
not a brilliant engineer. Nor did Krupp’s rise rest on major innovations
in product or process. It rested squarely on the tremendous support
Alfred Krupp built into his work force. Having grown up in extremes of
poverty and near-destitution, he, perhaps alone of the major business
builders of the mid-nineteenth-century Europe, had compassion for the
large masses of unskilled, unlet- tered, helpless peasants who were
being driven out of their wretched tenant farms in East Prussia by the
new “scientific agriculture” of the Junkers and who fled helter-skelter
into the newly industrializing Ruhr. Long before his firm became
profitable and prosperous, he provided housing, schooling, health care,
training, small loans at low interest, and so on. Indeed, Krupp at Essen
might be called the first welfare state.</p>
<p>It was a state ruled by an autocrat. Yet the “Kruppianers,” the
descendants of Alfred Krupp’s original workers, never forgot the
compassion of the original founder. They gave their loyalty to firm and
family even though Alfred Krupp was succeeded by three genera- tions of
incompetents. It was largely their dedication to the memory of Alfred
Krupp which enabled the firm to come back twice—after World War I and
after the almost total destruction of World War II.</p>
<p>But the Krupp example also shows the danger of welfare paternalism.
It eventually destroys itself. For it creates expectations which, in the
long run, no business enterprise—</p>
<p>and no institution—can live up to.</p>
<p>Krupp’s paternalism was a major reason, and perhaps the reason for
the ultimate col- lapse of the Krupp family. Krupp’s overexpansion after
World War II was in large meas- ure motivated by the need to live up to
the Krupp promise that every Kruppianer would forever have a job. This
in turn meant that the very parts of the Krupp concern that had the
least potential for growth in the post-World War II economy, e.g., coal
mines and steel mills located far inland, had to be expanded the most.
This ultimately brought the company to the verge of collapse. The family
was ousted from management and, in effect, expropriated by the banks as
their price of rescuing the business. Large numbers of old, loyal
Kruppianers had to be laid off in the middle of a serious recession in
the German coal and steel industry when no other jobs were
available.</p>
<p>Even more serious is the aftermath of a welfare paternalism which the
“children” ulti- mately outgrow and reject. It leaves behind a legacy of
bitterness and of mutual contempt that goes beyond anything the most
bitter industrial warfare could have produced.</p>
<p>Two of the nastiest and most bruising of recent labor conflicts were
rebellions against a paternalism that had outlived itself. One was the
strike at the Pilkington Brothers Glass Company at St. Helen’s, England,
in 1971—after almost a century of successful paternal- ism. Twenty years
earlier the employer with the greatest welfare concern for employees in
the United States—the Hershey Chocolate Company in Hershey,
Pennsylvania—had similarly come to the end of the paternalist road in a
strike that was made all the more bitter by the fact that the company is
not owned by “capitalists” but by a foundation for the benefit of the
employees.</p>
<p>The more successful welfare paternalism is—and the more needed—the
more should management prepare for its self-liquidation. And the way to
do this is of course, to de- velop the fullest possible responsibility
for job, work group, and work-community affairs or worker and work
force.</p>
<p>The Marks andandandand Spenser staff manageress (see Chapter 8) was a
welfare worker in the 1920s, when there was need for a highly
paternalist approach. The shopgirl who sold in the Marks andandandand
Spencer store in those days came straight out of the worst slums of the
old industrial cities. She was, as a rule, ignorant, illiterate,
helpless, frightened, if not indeed, brutalized. But as the work force
changed with the changes in British society the staff manageress ceased
to be a welfare worker and became teacher, coach, and a kind of om-
budswoman. Her primary job is no longer welfare. It is to be the
conscience of the com- pany in its management of people. She serves,
above all, as a communications channel from the employees to
management.</p>
<p>For knowledge workers welfare paternalism is altogether
inappropriate. But it also makes less and less sense for manual workers
who are well paid, have middle-class stan-</p>
<p>dards of living, and have substantial education.</p>
<p>This probably applies even to Japan with her strong tradition of
group belonging and of group responsibility for the individual. And
indeed, while Japanese companies are maintaining the traditional welfare
paternalism for their young women workers recruited largely from rural
areas, and for manual workers in general, a good many of them are
shifting slowly but steadily away from the traditional “family” concept
for their knowl- edge workers—and for good reasons. Japanese business,
now, when the need for paternal- ism is rapidly disappearing, might well
turn over the welfare functions to the work com- munity. Otherwise Japan
may soon face a crisis of welfare paternalism, as damaging to</p>
<p>the economy as Krupp’s overcommitment, and as destructive to
industrial cohesion as the Pilkington and Hershey strikes.</p>
<p>Even at its most successful, the welfare approach is not an approach
for managing people. It is an approach for helping people. It assumes
that people are defined by their weakness. It does not try to find and
make productive their strengths. It is a complement to the managing of
people rather than its substance.</p>
<p>The welfare approach is a temporary expedient. It is a crutch. As
such it may be very effective, may indeed be crucial to survival. But if
taken for permanent and seen as the final answer, it will eventually
cripple management and workers, company, economy, and society.</p>
<p>Personnel Management</p>
<p>The second approach to the management of people is personnel
management. It arose during and after World War I as an organized and
systematic management function.*</p>
<p>Personnel management is methodical and systematic discharge of all
the activities that have to be done where people are employed,
especially in large numbers: their selection and employment; training;
medical services, the cafeteria, and safety; the administration of
wages, salaries, and benefits, and many others.</p>
<p>Personnel management has to be done. Otherwise there is serious
malfunction. But personnel management activities bear the same
relationship to managing people as vac- uuming the living room and
washing the dishes bear to a happy marriage and the bringing up of
children. If too many dirty dishes pile up in the sink, the marriage may
come apart. But spotless dishes do not by themselves contribute a great
deal to wedded bliss or to close and happy relationships with one’s
children. These are hygiene factors. If neglected, they cause trouble.
They should be taken for granted.</p>
<p>Personnel management concerns itself largely with matters of great
concern to the work community. They should not be considered management
functions. They should be work-community functions and organized as
such. To regard personnel management as managing people at work, as has
been the tendency, is nonmanagement. It is substituting procedures for
policies and forms for substance.†</p>
<p>Personnel management departments have grown at an astronomical rate
since World War II in all countries and in all industries. They have
grown even faster in the public- service sector. Yet personnel managers
everywhere complain that they are “not listened to,” “not supported,”
“have not been truly accepted” by their management colleagues. There is
substance to these complaints. But in the main they reflect a feeling on
the part of the personnel people that there is something wrong with what
they are doing and that they are not addressing themselves to what they
profess to deal with, namely the management of people.</p>
<p>There is need in any organization for a “conscience” with regard to
people (see Chap- ter 42); and conscience functions are top-management
work. But personnel management cannot discharge the conscience job; it
is too busy with activities. Its usual work is “sup- port” (again see
Chapter 42). But it is primarily support to the work community—and this
is where it should be lodged.</p>
<p>Last among traditional approaches to managing people is to see in
them a cost and a threat.</p>
<p>There is need for the control of labor costs. There is need for the
control of labor pro- ductivity. There is need for “fire fighting.”
There is need for the organized guerrilla war- fare of union
relations—or at least we have let this need develop. To take care of
these things is necessary and may, at times, be crucial. But it is not
managing people. It is deal- ing with problems that result from the
failure to manage people. In anything as complex</p>
<p>*The pioneer was an American, Thomas Spates, who, after World War I,
worked first in the International Labor Office and then for many years
as personnel vice-president for a major American corporation, General
Foods. †On this see the chapter “Is Personnel Management Bankrupt?” in
my book, The Practice of Management.</p>
<p>as a modern organization, there will be such failures. But preventing
them, or even curing them, does not make the system work and
produce.</p>
<p>Managing means making the strengths of people effective. Neither the
welfare ap- proach, nor the personnel management approach, nor the
control and fire-fighting ap-</p>
<p>“People Are Our Greatest Asset”</p>
<p>Managers are fond of saying, “Our greatest asset is people.” They are
fond of repeating the truism that the only real difference between one
organization and another is the per- formance of people. All other
resources one organization commands to exactly the same extent as does
any other. And most managers know perfectly well that of all the
resources, people are the least utilized and that little of the human
potential of any organization is tapped and put to work.</p>
<p>But while managers proclaim that people are their major resource, the
traditional ap- proaches to the managing of people do not focus on
people as a resource, but as prob- lems, procedures, and costs.</p>
<p>Realization of this underlies recent proposals to put people into a
company’s financial accounts as “assets.” One such proposal—made by
Michael Schiff; a distinguished ac- counting scholar at New York
University—is to show sales and marketing forces as “in- vestment,” as
they indeed are.</p>
<p>It is perfectly true that the accounting treatment of people shows
them as “costs.” And human beings are always directed by the information
and measurements they receive, even if they know them to be one-sided,
biased, or deficient (on this see Chapter 39, “Controls, Control, and
Management”). An accounting system which would show people as “capital
investments” would therefore make a major difference.</p>
<p>But it is not easy to see how one could show people as assets on the
books. An asset is by definition something one can sell and something
that has a value when a company goes into liquidation. But a company
does not own people. And an asset which can give notice and leave is not
an asset in any sense of the word. There are equally serious practical
ob- jections. How does one, for instance, measure the return on
training?</p>
<p>Still, the idea has merit. It clearly would be highly desirable for
managers to be led by their own measurements and their own controls to
acting on their profession that “people are our greatest asset.” We
clearly need some thing more powerful than meetings, semi- nars,
“sensitivity training,” sermons, or proclamations.</p>
<p>Above all, however, we need practices. And they are easier to obtain
than changes in vision or attitude.</p>
<p>First, of course, is the practice of building responsibility and
achievement into job and work force. There need to be objectives for
every job, set by the man who is to attain the objectives, together with
his manager. The work itself has to be made productive so that the
worker ran work at making himself achieving. And the worker needs the
demand, the discipline, and the incentive of responsibility.</p>
<p>Second, the manager must treat the people with whom he works as
resource to him- self. He has to look to them for guidance regarding his
own job. He has to demand of them that they accept it as their
responsibility to enable their manager to do a better and more effective
job himself. The manager needs to build upward responsibility and upward
contribution into the job of each of his subordinates.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to ask each subordinate to think through and
answer a few sim- ple questions: “What do I do as your manager, and what
does your company do that helps you the most in your job?”; “What do I
do as your manager, and what does the company</p>
<p>do, that hinders you the most in your job?”; and “What can you do
that will help me, as your manager, to the best job for the
company?”</p>
<p>These may seem obvious questions. But they are rarely asked. Whenever
they are be- ing asked, the answers turn out to be far from obvious.</p>
<p>In every case I have come across it turned out that things the
manager did in order to help his people perform their jobs did not help
them at all and indeed hampered them. And it turned out that very few,
if any, of his subordinates had even given thought to the question of
what they might have to do to enable their manager to perform
better.</p>
<p>Such questions force both manager and subordinate to focus on common
performance.</p>
<p>They both focus on the purpose of their relationship. And they are
likely to induce in the manager a new perspective on the people who work
for him. He will make himself look to them as his resource, but will
also guide them to looking to him as their resource.</p>
<p>Placement</p>
<p>The final but perhaps the most important element in managing people
is to place them where their strengths can become productive.</p>
<p>Personnel management stresses selection for employment. It is
debatable whether the results justify the tremendous effort and the
elaborate and ingenious methods of tests, interviews, and selection
procedures that have been developed. In particular it is doubtful that
the complex selection procedures for knowledge people really “select”
anyone.</p>
<p>We know how to identify specific physical traits which render an
individual less likely to perform a specific manual activity,
e.g. laying bricks. We know nothing, however, about configurations of
character, personality, and talent such as come into play in knowl- edge
work and especially in work as a manager. Most American large companies
have been building large staffs of college recruiters who try to find
“potential” among college and professional school graduates. Insofar as
it is the job of these people to attract gradu- ates to their employer,
their activity makes sense. But with respect to their ability to “spot”
the “comers,” their record is dismal. Otherwise, three out of every five
of their “recruits” would not quit their first employer within the first
two or three years. Random selection, e.g., of every third one who
applies, is likely to produce better results. The rea- son is not lack
of skill of the college recruiter. The reason is that we do not know
what we look for in management potential, and have no way of testing it
except in performance.</p>
<p>And neither the elaborate, ritualistic game of the English house
party nor the grueling but purely formalistic entrance tests of the
large Japanese companies make more sense. Their only refinement over the
American practice is greater mental cruelty.</p>
<p>Placement, however, is left largely to chance. Yet no two people have
the same con- figuration of strengths and weaknesses. And no one has
only strengths; there are no “uni- versal geniuses.”* It is the
manager’s job to optimize resources. And placement is the way to
optimize the most expensive resource of them all: the human being.</p>
<p>The Japanese precisely because they cannot fire a man and are stuck
with him, often do a better job in placement than managers in the West.
Indeed (as said in Chapter 20), placing the young knowledge professional
and manager is one of the tasks the “godfather” is expected to discharge
systematically albeit behind the scenes.</p>
<p>In the West, we should be able, however, to do a much better job of
placement than the Japanese do. For the Western manager can take
responsibility for placing people both inside and outside his
organization. The “non-performer” should not be permitted to stay in the
organization—excepting only the “conscience cases” of old, deserving,
employees who have given long years of performance and have earned an
organization’s loyalty. For the non-performer damages the entire
organization. He imposes a load on his fellow em- ployees, who have to
“carry” him. He undermines morale, the organization’s standards, and its
self-respect.</p>
<p>*On placement see also the chapter “Making Strength Effective” in my
book, The Effective Executive.</p>
<p>However, the non-performer is often—and perhaps in most cases—not a
“dud.” He is only in the wrong place—the proverbial square peg in the
round hole. He belongs else- where, where what he can do is needed and
contributes. It is the manager’s job, especially with the young
knowledge worker, to think through where a non-performer might be pro-
ductive and effective, and to say to him, “You are in the wrong
business—you belong</p>
<p>Such practices will not satisfy the many critics of traditional
people management who call for new convictions and for a fundamental
change in attitudes. To be sure, treating people as a resource to the
manager and emphasis on placement where their strengths can be effective
are only “practices.” But they are a good deal more than rhetoric and
pious platitude. They are hard, demanding work. They will not create
utopia-in-organization. But they will point organizations toward
performance rather than conformance. These practices will not make dull
jobs and dull people interesting. But they will go a long way toward
preventing interesting jobs and interesting people from being dulled.
They will not eliminate the basic functions and tensions of organization
and make its problems of economies and power go away. But they might
release countervailing forces of trust and achievement. These practices
will not make unnecessary the traditional approaches to people as
problems, as chores, as cost, and as threat.</p>
<p>But, though only the first steps, they move manager and management
beyond person- nel management and toward the leadership of people.</p>

<p>T</p>
<p>HE “SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF BUSINESS” have been discussed for a
cen- tury. Indeed, a chapter or two on social responsibility—or some
similar heading can be found in almost any text on general
management.</p>
<p>But since the early sixties the meaning of the words “social
responsibility of business”</p>
<p>has changed radically.</p>
<p>Earlier discussions of social responsibilities of business centered
in three areas. One was the perennial question of the relationship
between private ethics and public ethics. To what extent is a manager in
charge of an organization beholden to the ethics of the indi- vidual and
to what extent does his responsibility to the organization permit him—or
per- haps even compel him—to resort to privately unethical behavior for
the good of his or- ganization? The text for this discussion,
consciously or not, is an old epigram of the poli- ticians: “What
scoundrels we would be if we did in our private lives what we do in our
public capacity for our countries.”</p>
<p>The second major topic was the social responsibility which the
employer bears toward his employees by virtue of his power and wealth.
The classic discussion is to be found in a book by the English Quaker
industrialist and philanthropist B. Seebohm Rowntree, The Human Needs of
Labor (1918).</p>
<p>Finally, social responsibility was the term used to assert—or
assign—leadership re- sponsibility of the businessman with respect to
the “culture” of the community: support of the arts, the museums, the
opera, and the symphony orchestra; service as a trustee on the boards of
educational and religious institutions, and also giving money to
philanthropic and other community causes. And in the United States in
particular, willingness to serve in governmental or quasi-governmental
positions has become in this century an important social responsibility
of the executive.</p>
<p>By and large the traditional approach was not concerned, as it
claimed to be, with the social responsibility of business but with the
social responsibility of businessmen. And the greatest emphasis was put
on what businessmen should or might contribute outside of business hours
and outside their businesses.</p>
<p>After World War II there was increasing emphasis on the contribution
of business.</p>
<p>But this was a result of tax laws which, on the one hand, slowed down
the accumulation of large fortunes by individuals, and on the other
hand, encouraged and made highly at- tractive charitable contributions
on the part of a company. The emphasis otherwise re- mained unchanged.
Where an earlier generation had looked to the “rich businessman” to
endow a hospital, post-World War II big business was expected to support
worthy causes.</p>
<p>Emphasis was still on outside “causes” rather than on the behavior
and actions of business itself.</p>
<p>Some earlier writers took a broader view. Eiichi Shibusawa in the
Japan of early and mid-Meiji, that is, before 1900, and Walter Rathenau
in Germany in the years before World War I wrote extensively on the
relationship between business, especially large business, and the
society around it. But even Shibusawa and Rathenau were mainly con-
cerned with setting limits to business and with making business and
businessmen fit them- selves to social and community values.</p>
<p>When social responsibilities are being discussed these days, however,
the emphasis is quite different. It is on what business should or might
do to tackle and solve problems of society. The emphasis is on the
contribution business can make to such social problems as racial
discrimination and racial integration in the United States, or on the
maintenance and restoration of the physical environment. One of the best
examples of the new attitude comes from Sweden.</p>
<p>Several large Swedish companies, especially ASEA, the big
electrical-apparatus com- pany, were harshly attacked in the late
sixties in the Swedish press for participating in a major electric-power
project in Africa. The project was sponsored by the UN and fi- nanced by
the World Bank; it also had been endorsed by the socialist government of
Sweden. Its purpose was to raise the living standards of a desperately
poor region of Black Africa. But it was located in a Portuguese colony.
Hence, it was vehemently ar- gued, the Swedish companies participating
in it “supported colonialism” by helping to raise the standards of
living of the native population. It was their duty, so the argument ran,
to work for the “downfall of colonialism,” which would best be achieved
by keeping the natives desperately poor rather than have them prosper
under an “imperialist ex- ploiter.”</p>
<p>The most extreme assertion of social responsibilities of business is
perhaps a state- ment made during the sixties by the Mayor of New York
City, John Lindsay.</p>
<p>The Mayor called on the big corporations of New York City to “adopt”
a Black ghetto neighborhood and to make sure that the people in that
neighborhood would have the ne- cessities of life, would get education,
and would get jobs. He then added that he hoped that these major
corporations would also make sure that each Black family had a man in
the house who would be husband to the wife and father to the
children.</p>
<p>Only ten years earlier one could not have imagined anyone, not even
the most extreme “leftist” of “progressive,” berating business for its
refusal to nullify the foreign policy of its own government (and a
socialist one to boot) or for shunning paternalistic control over the
sex life of citizens who were not even employees.</p>
<p>This new concept of social responsibility no longer asks what the
limitations on busi- ness are, or what business should be doing for
those under its immediate authority. It de- mands that business take
responsibility for social problems, social issues, social and po-
litical goals, and that it become the keeper of society’s conscience and
the solver of soci- ety’s problems.</p>
<p>But increasingly such social responsibility is also being demanded of
non-business in- stitutions in society. Universities, hospitals, and
government agencies, but also learned societies, whether of physicists,
historians, or linguists, are all increasingly being con- fronted with
similar demands and attacked for not assuming responsibility for
society’s ills and problems.</p>
<p>In the early sixties student riots against the university arose out
of student grievances.</p>
<p>But the student riots of 1968 that almost destroyed Columbia
University in New York City were sparked by complaints that the
university had failed to take full social responsi- bility for the
neighboring Black community of Harlem and had failed to subordinate its
own educational goals to the alleged needs of Harlem’s hard-core
unemployables.</p>
<p>What Explains It?</p>
<p>The most popular and most obvious explanation is the wrong one. It is
not hostility to business that explains the surge of demands for social
responsibility On the contrary it is the success of the business system
which leads to new and, in many cases, exaggerated expectations. The
demand for social responsibility is, in large measure, the price of suc-
cess.</p>
<p>In developed countries we now take economic performance for granted.
This has 1ed to the belief that there is, or should be, universal
capacity for economic performance. It has led us to believe that the
same efforts which, within a century, lifted one-third of hu- manity
from poverty into affluence can in much less time raise the remaining
two-thirds of mankind into affluence, or can at least bring them into
rapid economic development.</p>
<p>Less than two generations ago, in the years around World War I,
poverty was still taken for granted as the universal condition of
mankind. No one then assumed economic development to be the rule. It was
considered an exception. What was considered surpris- ing in 1900, or
even in 1950, was not that India remained poor. Indeed anyone who would
then have talked about the economic development of India would have been
considered inane. What was exceptional, and truly surprising, was that
Japan had managed to break out of the all but universal poverty of
mankind and to start on the road to development. Today lack of
development is considered the exception and the “problem.” And no matter
how rapid development is—e.g., in Brazil since World War II—it is
considered inade- quate because it does not transform an entire country,
within one generation, from ex- treme misery to comfortable
affluence.</p>
<p>No one, only two generations ago, expected poverty to disappear, even
in the devel- oped and wealthy countries at that time. Few people today
would believe the descriptions and illustrations in the first systematic
survey of the poor in what was then the world’s richest city, London,
which Charles Booth published just before the turn of the century.* Only
the horror stories that come out of Calcutta equal them today. Yet, to
contemporar- ies, the London poor of the 1890s seemed so affluent by
comparison with the conditions described and illustrated twenty years
earlier,† that Marx’s partner, Friedrich Engels, in reissuing in 1896
his earlier The Conditions of the Working Classes in England, was forced
to admit that his and Marx’s earlier prophecy of the increasing
“pauperization” of the “proletariat” could no longer be maintained.</p>
<p>In particular, the poverty that is most offensive to us today, that
is, poverty in the midst of affluence, was then taken for granted. No
one in the nineteenth or early twentieth centuries expected
pre-industrial immigrants into the industrial cities to be other than
poor, destitute, incompetent, and wretched. No one expected a rapid
transformation of the slums of industrial Lancashire or of the
industrializing Vienna in Austria around 1900. All anyone expected was a
little humanity to assuage the worst of the suffering, and a little
charity. At best there were attempts to help a few of unusual endowment
and personal ambition to raise themselves out of the slough of despond.
To the orthodox Marxist even this was sentimental romanticism. Following
his master he considered these people Lum- penproletariat and incapable
of improving themselves either individually or collectively.</p>
<p>Nothing in earlier social and economic history equals the recent
economic and social development of the American Negro. Within twenty
years, from 1950 to 1970, two-thirds of one of the least prepared and
most disadvantaged of pre-industrial immigrants into modern civilization
have risen from extreme poverty into middle-class status. They have
acquired competence and jobs. A larger proportion of their children
acquire higher educa- tion than of the children of older immigrant
groups in the city, such as Italians or Poles who encounter no “racial”
barrier.</p>
<p>Admittedly the American Negro is a very special problem. But still,
the difference be- tween what was considered success only a half century
ago and what is now considered</p>
<p>*Charles Booth, Life and Labour of the People in London, published
between 1892 and 1897.</p>
<p>†For instance by Charles Dickens the Younger, in his famous
Dictionary of London, first published in 1879 and intended as a guide to
“enjoyment” for the tourist visiting the city.</p>
<p>grim failure illustrates the extent to which success has changed
expectations. Even rather well-to-do “middle-class” people yesterday had
only little of the qualities of life we now expect routinely.</p>
<p>The apartment buildings of the late nineteenth century still stand in
most European cit- ies. They are hardly “good housing”—airless and dark,
with mean little flats, five floors high without elevator, heating—a
coal or wood stove—only in the “parlor,” and with one tiny, grimy
bathroom for a family of seven. Yet they were built for the new middle
classes. Health care was almost nonexistent, education beyond the
elementary level a privilege of the few, the newspaper a luxury. And no
matter how serious an environmental problem the automobile poses in
today’s big city, the horse was dirtier, smelled worse, killed and
maimed more people, and congested the streets just as much.</p>
<p>And life on the farm, that is, life for the great majority, was, if
anything, poorer, dirt- ier, more dangerous to life and limb, and more
brutish.</p>
<p>As late as 1900 or 1914 quality of life was a concern only of the few
rich. To all the others it was “escapism” that could be permitted in the
syrupy romances that sold by the millions and were devoured alike by
servant girls and their “ladies.” Reality, however, was the numbing
daily struggle for a little food, a dreary job and enough money to pay
the premium on burial insurance.</p>
<p>That we can worry about the qualities of life is thus very great
success. And it is only right and natural that the same leadership
groups which were responsible for the success in providing the
quantities of life are expected to assume responsibility now for
providing the quality of life.</p>
<p>The same reason explains the demand for social responsibility on the
part of the uni- versity. For the university too is a success story of
the twentieth century.</p>
<p>“If science can tell us how to put a man on the moon,” the student
activists of the six- ties said again and again, “it surely can tell us
how to create a decent environment, save our cities from drugs, make
marriages happy and children enjoy school. If it doesn’t, the only
explanation must be ‘wrong value priorities’ or malicious
conspiracy.”</p>
<p>To be sure, these arguments are naive. But they are not irrational.
The clamor for so- cial responsibility expects too much. But it expects
the right things. Its root is not hostility to authority, but
overconfidence in managers and management.</p>
<p>The Disenchantment with Government</p>
<p>On top of this comes the growing disenchantment with government, the
growing disbelief in government’s ability to solve major social
problems.*</p>
<p>Only a generation ago the people who now demand social responsibility
from business (or the university) expected government to be able to take
care of every problem of soci- ety, if not of every problem of the
individual as well. There is still, in all countries, pres- sure for
more and more government programs—though there is also growing
resistance to more and more expenditures and taxes. But even the most
fervent advocate of an activist government no longer truly expects
results, even in countries where respect for and belief in government
are still high, such as in Japan, Sweden, and Germany. Even the most
fer- vent advocate of a strong government no longer believes that a
problem has been solved the moment it has been turned over to
government. As a result, the people most concerned with these problems,
the liberals and progressives who, a generation ago, rallied under the
banner of “more government,” now increasingly look to other leadership
groups, other institutions, and, above all, to business, to take on the
problems which government should but is not able to solve.</p>
<p>Robert Kennedy, rather than the National Association of
Manufacturers, proposed that the rehabilitation of the slums in the big
American cities be taken on by business. And one of the staunchest and
most respected advocates of government activism, and America’s leading
labor union theoretician, the late Frank Tannenbaum of Columbia
University, at</p>
<p>*On this see also Chapter 10, “The Sickness of Govemment,” in my
book, The Age of Discontinuity.</p>
<p>the very end of his life, in the spring of 1968, proclaimed (in the
Journal of World Busi- ness, published by Columbia University) that the
multinational corporation was “the last best hope” and the only
foundation of a peaceful world.</p>
<p>The New Leadership Groups</p>
<p>Altogether it is the succession of management to the leadership
position in society that underlies the demands for social
responsibility.</p>
<p>In this century the managers of our major institutions have become
the leaders in every developed country, and in most developing countries
as well. The old leadership groups, whether the aristocracy or the
priesthood, have either disappeared entirely or have become
insignificant. Even the scientists, the priesthood of the post-World War
II period, have lost much of their prestige. The only new leadership
groups to emerge are managers, managers of business enterprise and of
universities, of government agencies and of hospi- tals. They command
the resources of society. But they also command the competence. It is,
therefore, only logical that they are expected to take the leadership
role and take re- sponsibility for major social problems and major
social issues.</p>
<p>As a result of these shifts—the emergence of managers as the major
leadership group; the growing disenchantment with government, and the
shift in focus from the quantities of life to the quality of life—the
demand has arisen that managers, and especially business managers, make
concern for society central to the conduct of business itself. It is a
de- mand that the quality of life become the business of business. The
traditional approach asks, “How can we arrange the making of cars (or of
shoes) so as not to impinge on social values and beliefs, on individuals
and their freedom, and on the good society altogether?” The new demand
is for business to make social values and beliefs, create freedom for
the individual, and produce the good society.</p>
<p>This demand requires new thinking and new action on the part of the
managers. It cannot be handled in the traditional manner. It cannot be
handled by public relations.</p>
<p>Public relations asks whether a business or an industry is “liked” or
“understood.”</p>
<p>Public relations would therefore be worried that Black Power
advocates blame the profit motive for the ghetto, and that they
presumably like business just as little as they like any other part of
the white establishment. But what really matters is that the Black Power
leaders expect business to perform miracles with respect to ghetto
employment, ghetto education, ghetto housing; and they expect these
miracles virtually overnight. The rele- vant questions are: “Can
business tackle these huge problems? How? Should business tackle them?”
These are not questions which public-relations is equipped to
handle.</p>
<p>Three Cautionary Tales</p>
<p>Books and magazines these days are full of horror stories of
“business irresponsibility,” of “greed,” and “incompetence.” There is no
doubt that there are irresponsible, greedy, and incompetent managers and
businesses. Managers, after all, are members of the human race. But the
real problems of social responsibility are not irresponsibility, greed,
and incompetence. If they were, the problem would be easy. One could
then set forth stan- dards of conduct and hold business to them.
Unfortunately the basic problems of social responsibility are different.
They are problems of good intentions, honorable conduct, and high
responsibility—gone wrong.</p>
<p>This can be illustrated by three “cautionary tales.”</p>
<p>Union Carbide and Vienna, West Virginia</p>
<p>West Virginia, never one of the more prosperous areas of the United
States, went into rapid economic decline in the late twenties as the
coal industry, long the state’s mainstay, began to shrink. The decline
of the coal industry was hastened by rising concern with mine accidents
and miners diseases. For many of the coal mines of West Virginia were
small and marginal and could not afford modern safety precautions or
adequate health protection.</p>
<p>By the late 1940s the leading industrial company in the state became
alarmed over the steady economic shrinkage of the region. Union Carbide,
one of America’s major chemi- cal companies, had its headquarters in New
York. But the original plants of the company had been based on West
Virginia coal, and the company was still the largest employer in the
state, other than a few large coal mines. Accordingly, the company’s top
management asked a group of young engineers and economists in its employ
to prepare a plan for the creation of employment opportunities in West
Virginia, and especially for the location of the company’s new plant
facilities in areas of major unemployment in the state. For the worst
afflicted area, however, the westernmost corner of the state on the
border of Ohio, the planners could not come up with an attractive
project. Yet this area needed jobs the most. In and around the little
town of Vienna, West Virginia, there was total unemploy- ment, and no
prospects for new industries. The only plant that could possibly be put
in the Vienna area was a ferroalloy plant using a process that had
already become obsolete and had heavy cost disadvantages compared to
more modern processes such as Union Car- bide’s competitors were already
using.</p>
<p>Even for the old process, Vienna was basically an uneconomical
location. The process required very large amounts of coal of fair
quality. But the only coal available within the area was coal of such
high sulfur content that it could not be used without expensive
treatment and scrubbing. Even then—that is, after heavy capital
investment—the process was inherently noisy and dirty, releasing large
amounts of fly ash and of noxious gases.</p>
<p>In addition, the only transportation facilities, both rail and road,
were not in West Virignia but across the river, on the Ohio side.
Putting the plant there, however, meant that the prevailing westerly
winds would blow the soot from the smokestacks and the sul- fur released
by the power plants directly into the town of Vienna, on the other bank
of the river.</p>
<p>Yet the Vienna plant would provide 1,500 jobs in Vienna itself and
another 500 to 1,000 jobs in a new coal field not too far distant. In
addition, the new coal field would be capable of being strip-mined, so
the new mining jobs would be free from the accident and health hazards
that had become increasingly serious in the old and worked-out coal
mines of the area. Union Carbide top management came to the conclusion
that social responsi- bility demanded building the new plant, despite
its marginal economics.</p>
<p>The plant was built with the most up-to-date antipollution equipment
known at the time. Whereas even big-city power stations were then
content to trap half the fly ash es- caping their smokestacks, the
Vienna plant installed scrubbers to catch 75 percent— though there was
little anyone could do about the sulfur dioxide fumes emitted by the
high-sulfur coal.</p>
<p>When the plant was opened in 1951, Union Carbide was the hero.
Politicians, public figures, educators, all praised the company for its
social responsibility. But ten years later the former savior was fast
becoming the public enemy. As the nation became pollution- conscious,
the citizens of Vienna began to complain more and more bitterly about
the ash, the soot, and the fumes that floated across the river into
their town and homes. About 1961 a new mayor was elected on the platform
“fight pollution,” which meant “fight Un- ion Carbide.” Ten years later
the plant had become a “national scandal.” Even Business Week—hardly a
publication hostile to business—chastised Union Carbide (in February,
1971) in an article entitled “A Corporate Polluter Learns the Hard
Way.”</p>
<p>There is little doubt that Union Carbide’s management did not behave
very intelli- gently. They should have realized in the early sixties
that they were in trouble, rather than delay and procrastinate, make and
then break promises—until the citizens, the state gov- ernment, the
press, the environmentalists, and the federal government all were aiming
their biggest guns at the company. It was not very smart to protest for
years that there was nothing wrong with the plant and then, when
governmental authorities began to get nasty, announce that the plant
would have to be closed as it could not be brought up to environ- mental
standards.</p>
<p>Yet this is not the basic lesson of this cautionary tale. Once the
decision had been made to employ an obsolescent process and to build an
economically marginal plant in</p>
<p>order to alleviate unemployment in a bitterly depressed area, the
rest followed more or less automatically. This decision meant that the
plant did not generate the revenues needed to be rebuilt. There is very
little doubt that on economic reasoning alone the plant would never have
been built. Public opinion forced Union Carbide to invest substantial
sums in that plant to remedy the worst pollution problems—though it is
questionable whether the technology exists to do more than a patch-up
job. Publicity also forced Union Carbide to keep the plant open. But,
once the spotlight shifts elsewhere, most of the jobs in the Vienna,
West Virginia, plant are likely to disappear again, if indeed the plant
re- mains open at all.</p>
<p>Swift do Argentina and Deltec</p>
<p>The Swift meat-packing plant in the Buenos Aires port district has
been the largest meat- packing plant in Argentina for many years. It has
also been a major employer in a poor area of Buenos Aires. Originally a
subsidiary of Swift of Chicago, the company became independent, though
still under American ownership, shortly after World War II.</p>
<p>But the Argentineans meat-packing industry fell on evil days after
World War II—in part because of government measures that have been
driving up the price of Argentinean cattle, while cutting down the
supply, thus making Argentinean beef increasingly non- competitive in
the world market and depriving meat-packers of their source of raw mate-
rials. Swift became increasingly unprofitable. The owners finally sold
out in 1968 to a Canadian-based “multinational,” Deltec, a company that
is active in many parts of Latin America, primarily in financial service
businesses. Deltec promptly started to modernize the Swift plant to make
it competitive again. But the Argentinean meat-packing industry
continued on its decline.</p>
<p>Swift’s two major competitors, both foreign-owned, decided in the
late sixties to close down. They paid off the workers according to
Argentinean law and went out of business. Deltec, however, decided that
it could not afford to do this in view of its many other in- terests in
Latin America. It had to maintain employment in an area where
unemployment was far too high anyhow. Deltec worked out an agreement
with the labor unions under which employment was substantially cut and
productivity greatly improved. The company poured substantial amounts of
money into the plant and used its financial connections to obtain
foreign bank loans for it. Still the meat business in Argentina did not
improve.</p>
<p>By 1971 Swift had used up all the capital Deltec could make available
to it and was still not back on a profitable and competitive basis.
Thereupon Swift worked out a volun- tary agreement with the creditors,
including the company’s workers, for full repayment of all debts over an
extended period—with Deltec being the last creditor to receive any
payment. Eighty-six percent of the creditors, far more than required by
law, accepted this agreement. But to everyone’s surprise the Argentinean
judge, whose approval had been expected as a mere formality, turned the
agreement down. He decided that Deltec had obtained it improperly,
declared Swift do Argentina bankrupt, ordered its liquidation, and asked
the Argentinean government to appoint a liquidator. In effect he
expropriated the company and its property. He not only refused to
recognize any rights of Deltec as a creditor but decided that all Deltec
holdings in other Argentinean companies be im- pounded as security for
Swift’s debts to Argentinean creditors.</p>
<p>There was no public pressure for such an action—and no legal pressure
either. The Swift workers, although members of the most militant of
Argentinean unions, fully sup- ported Deltec. Yet the decision found
tremendous approval in Argentina, even among people who by no stretch of
the imagination could be considered anti-business or even anti-American.
“The other foreign-owned meat-packers;” a good many people said, “did
the right thing in closing down their plants and paying off their
workers when they could no longer operate economically. Deltec, by
trying to keep going, raised expectations which it then cruelly had to
disappoint.”</p>
<p>Civil Rights and the Quaker Conscience</p>
<p>In the late 1940s a major American steel company appointed a new
general manager for its large southern division, located in one of the
most strongly “white supremacy” areas in the South. Traditionally, all
top management positions in that division had been held by Southerners.
The new appointee was a Northerner. Moreover, he was a scion of one of
the old Philadelphia Quaker families and had been active in several
civil rights organizations.</p>
<p>Upon his appointment top management called him in and said, “We know
what we are doing and why we are appointing you. To be sure, your
performance has earned this pro- motion. But you are also a Northerner
and committed to employment equality for the Black man. And this, of
course, is what both the laws of the United States and our union
contract demand of us. Yet, as we all know, our southern division has
never given em- ployment opportunities to Blacks. No Black, however
skilled, no matter what his job, has ever been paid more than ‘helper’s’
wages. We have never been able to make a dent in this down south. But we
know that we will not be able much longer to defend and to keep up these
practices. We expect you, therefore, to move as fast as you can for
civil rights for our Negro employees, as the laws of the country and our
union contract demand. Try to get the support and cooperation of the top
people in the union which represents our work- ers. We know that you
have been working with them in several civil rights organizations.”</p>
<p>The new general manager spent about a year getting accepted by his
new associates, getting known in the local community, and establishing
friendly relations with the union leaders in the mill. Then he saw his
opportunity. A new major extension to the mill was about to be opened,
and a number of new furnaces had to manned. The new general man- ager
strictly applied the hiring provisions of the union contract. As a
result, a small but still substantial number of Black workers with high
job skills and considerable seniority got positions on the new crews. In
no case was a white worker deprived of his seniority rights or put under
a Black man as his supervisor.</p>
<p>The morning after the new manning tables had been posted, as required
by the union contract, a delegation of local union leaders called on the
general manager. “You know that there are several hundred grievances,”
they said, “which have been pending for far too long a time without a
settlement. The patience of our men is exhausted. We are going out on
strike in thirty-six hours. But we don’t want to be unreasonable. If the
company makes even a token gesture of goodwill, we will postpone this
strike. All you have to do is to suspend those manning tables you just
posted, and let us, together with the supervi- sors, work out the
composition of the crews for the new furnaces. In the meantime, here is
the official strike notice as required by our contract.”</p>
<p>The general manager first tried to reach the president and the
general counsel of the union. Unaccountably, neither could be found, nor
did their secretaries know where they could be reached or when they
would return. Then the general manager bethought himself of an old
friend, one of the “sages” of the Quakers and a “radical” on race
relations, and especially on employment opportunities for Blacks. But to
the general manager’s im- mense surprise, the “sage” was not one bit
sympathetic with his plight. “I fully agree with you, as you know, in
considering employment discrimination against the Negro to be ille- gal,
immoral, and sinful,” the sage said. “But what you have done, while
legal, is just as immoral. You have used the economic muscle of a big
company to impose your mores and values on the community in which you
operate. Yours are the right mores and the right values. But, still, you
are using the economic power of a business, the power of the employer,
and the authority of your office to dictate to the community. This is
‘economic imperialism’ and it cannot be condoned, no matter how good the
cause.”</p>
<p>The general manager resigned and took another job up north. The
company quietly dropped the manning tables. The mills remained open. And
a few years later, needless to say, the company came under bitter
attack—in which the union’s general counsel joined loudly—for its
failure to take leadership in race matters. As the biggest employer in
the community, the critics charged, the company had a social
responsibility not to condone practices which it must have known to be
both illegal and immoral.</p>
<p>Clearly, the demand for social responsibility is not as simple as
most books, articles, and speeches on the subject make it out to be. But
it is not possible to disregard it, as such distinguished economists as
Milton Friedman of Chicago have urged. To be sure, Fried- man’s argument
that business is an economic institution and should stick to its
economic task is well taken. There is danger that social responsibility
will undermine economic per- formance and with it society altogether.
There is surely an even greater danger that social responsibility will
mean usurpation of power by business managers in areas in which they
have no legitimate authority.*</p>
<p>But it is also clear that social responsibility cannot be evaded. It
is not only that the public demands it. It is not only that society
needs it. The fact remains that in modern society there is no other
leadership group but managers. If the managers of our major in-
stitutions, and especially of business, do not take responsibility for
the common good, no one else can or will. Government—is no longer
capable, as political theories still have it, of being the “sovereign”
and the “guardian of the common good” in a pluralist society of
organizations. The leadership groups in this society, and this means the
managers of the key institutions, whether they like it or not—indeed
whether they are competent or not— have to think through what
responsibilities they can and should assume, in what areas, and for what
objectives.</p>
<p>If there is one moral to these cautionary tales, it is not that
social responsibility is both ambiguous and dangerous. It is that social
impacts and social responsibilities are areas in which business—and not
only big business—has to think through its role, has to set ob-
jectives, has to perform. Social impacts and social responsibilities
have to be managed.</p>

<p>S</p>
<p>OCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES—whether of a business, a hospital, or a
university— may arise in two areas. They may emerge out of the social
impacts of the institution. Or they arise as problems of the society
itself. Both are of concern to management because the institution which
managers manage lives of necessity in society and commu- nity. But
otherwise the two areas are different The first deals with what an
institution does to society. The second is concerned with what an
institution can do for society.</p>
<p>The modern organization exists to provide a specific service to
society. It therefore has to be in society. It has to be in a community,
has to be a neighbor, has to do its work within a social setting. But
also it has to employ people to do its work. Its social impacts
inevitably go beyond the specific contribution it exists to make.</p>
<p>The purpose of the hospital is not to employ nurses and cooks. It is
patient care. But to accomplish this purpose, nurses and cooks are
needed. And in no time at all they form a work community with its own
community tasks and community problems.</p>
<p>The purpose of a ferroalloy plant is not to make noise or to release
noxious fumes. It is to make high-performance metals that serve the
customer. But in order to do this, it produces noise, creates heat, and
releases fumes.</p>
<p>Nobody in his right senses wants to create a traffic jam. But if a
lot of people are em- ployed in one place and have to enter and leave at
the same time, a traffic jam will be a totally unintended and yet
inescapable by-product.</p>
<p>These impacts are incidental to the purpose of the organization. But
in large measure they are inescapable by-products.</p>
<p>Social problems, by contrast, are dysfunctions of society rather than
impacts of the or- ganization and its activities.</p>
<p>The steel company discussed in the preceding chapter did, of course,
practice racial discrimination. But racial discrimination was not caused
by its activities; it was not an impact. On the contrary, the racial
problem of the old South has all along been considered by business a
major obstacle to industrialization and economic development. It has
been an external condition to which any institution operating in
southern society had to con- form. Similarly, Swift do Argentina—or the
Argentinean meat-packers as a whole—did not cause the long-time secular
decline of the Argentinean livestock industry and the re- sulting
unemployment in the Port of Buenos Aires. On the contrary, they fought
the gov- ernment policies responsible for the decline.</p>
<p>Still, both the U.S. steel company operating in the South and Swift
do Argentina could not escape concern. Such problems are the
degenerative diseases or the toxic wastes of the society and community
in which a business exists. Since the institution can exist only within
the social environment, is indeed an organ of society, such social
problems affect the institution. They are of concern to it even if, as
in the steel company’s case, the com- munity itself sees no problem and
resists any attempt to tackle it.</p>
<p>A healthy business, a healthy university, a healthy hospital cannot
exist in a sick soci- ety. Management has a self-interest in a healthy
society, even though the cause of soci- ety’s sickness is none of
management’s making.</p>
<p>Responsibility for Impacts</p>
<p>One is responsible for one’s impacts, whether they are intended or
not. This is the first rule. There is no doubt regarding management’s
responsibility for the social impacts of its organization. They are
management’s business.</p>
<p>In the Union Carbide story in the preceding chapter, the main reason
why the commu- nity became so incensed against the company was probably
not the pollution it caused. The community knew as well as Union Carbide
that the pollution was incidental to pro- duction, and thereby to the
jobs on which the community depended. But what the com- munity bitterly
resented, and with reason, was Union Carbide’s refusal for long years to
accept responsibility. This is indeed irresponsible.</p>
<p>Because one is responsible for one’s impacts, one minimizes them. The
fewer impacts an institution has outside of its own specific purpose and
mission, the better does it con- duct itself, the more responsibly does
it act, and the more acceptable a citizen, neighbor, and contributor it
is. Impacts which are not essential, and which are not part of the dis-
charge of one’s own specific purpose and mission, should be kept to the
absolute mini- mum. Even if they appear to be beneficial, they are
outside the proper boundaries of one’s function and will, therefore,
sooner or later be resented, be resisted, and be considered
impositions.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons why management should, in its own
self-interest, foster self- government of the work community (see
Chapter 21) is precisely that the community functions of the plant are
incidental to the purpose of the business. They are not essential to it.
The business exists to produce shoes or candy, or to turn out insurance
policies. Any control that goes beyond what is strictly necessary to get
the work done is incidental to the main function. It is an impact. And
it should, therefore, be minimized, if it cannot be eliminated.</p>
<p>Impacts are at best a nuisance. At worst they are deleterious. They
are never benefi- cial. Indeed they always carry within themselves a
cost and a threat. Impacts use up re- sources, burn up or waste raw
materials, or at the least, tie up management efforts. Yet they add
nothing to the value of the product or to the customer’s satisfaction.
They are “friction,” that is, nonproductive cost.</p>
<p>But even minor impacts are likely to become “crises” and “scandal”
and to result in serious damage to business—or to any other institution
that disregards its impacts. What only yesterday seemed harmless—and
indeed even popular—suddenly becomes an of- fense, a public outcry, a
major issue. Unless management has taken responsibility for the impact,
thought it through, and worked out the optimal resolution, the result
will be puni- tive or restrictive legislation and an outcry against the
“greed of business” or the “irre- sponsibility of the university.”</p>
<p>It is not enough to say, “But the public doesn’t object.” It is,
above all, not enough to say that any action to come to grips with such
a problem is going to be “unpopular,” is going to be “resented” by one’s
colleagues and one’s associates, and is not required. Sooner or later
society will come to regard any such impact as an attack on its
integrity and will exact a high price from those who have not
responsibly worked on eliminating the impact or on finding a solution to
the problem.</p>
<p>Here are some examples.</p>
<p>In the late forties and early fifties, one American automobile
company tried to make the American public safety-conscious. Ford
introduced cars with seat belts. But sales dropped catastrophically. The
company had to withdraw the cars with seat belts and abandoned the whole
idea. When, fifteen years later, the American driving public became
safety-conscious, the car manufacturers were sharply attacked for their
“total lack of con- cern with safety” and for being “merchants of
death.” And the resulting regulations were written as much to punish the
companies as to protect the public.</p>
<p>Several large electric-power companies had tried for years to get the
various state util- ity commissions to approve low-sulfur fuels and
cleaning devices in smokestacks. The commissions discouraged them again
and again, with the argument that the public was entitled to power at
the lowest possible cost. They pointed out that neither a more expen-
sive fuel nor capital investment to clean the smoke could be permitted
in the rate base as a legitimate cost under the state laws. Yet when
eventually air pollution became a matter of public concern, the same
power companies were roundly berated for “befouling the envi-
ronment.”</p>
<p>Public-service institutions similarly pay the price of neglecting
impacts or of dismiss- ing them as trivial. Columbia University was
almost destroyed because it did not take responsibility for an impact
but had comforted itself with the notion that the impact was trivial.
The explosion which rocked Columbia to its foundations in 1968 came over
a per- fectly harmless and minor matter: a plan to build a new
university gymnasium which would be available equally to university
students and to the residents of the Black ghetto which abuts Columbia.
But the causes for the explosion lay much deeper. They were the
conviction on the part of Columbia and of its faculty that a liberal
educational institution does not have to concern itself with its
relations with its Black ghetto neighborhood.</p>
<p>Another example of impact is the business that is “too big” for its
own good and that of the community. (On this see Chapter 55, “On Being
the Wrong Size.”) The business that is too big, especially the business
that is too big for the local community, is a threat to its community
but, above all, to itself. It is incumbent on management to correct the
situa- tion in the interest of the business (or of the university or
hospital). To ignore the problem is to put ego, desire for power, and
vanity ahead of the good of the institution and of the community. And
this is irresponsible.</p>
<p>Identifying Impacts</p>
<p>The first job of management is, therefore, to identify and to
anticipate impacts—coldly and realistically. The question is not “Is
what we do right?” It is “Is what we do what so- ciety and the customer
pay us for?” And if an activity is not integral to the institution’s
purpose and mission, it is to be considered as a social impact and as
undesirable.</p>
<p>This sounds easy. It is actually very difficult. The best
illustration is the problem of “technology assessment,” that is, the
identification of social and economic impacts of new technology at the
time of its introduction.</p>
<p>There is, these days, great interest in technology assessment, that
is in anticipating im- pact and side effects of new technology before
going ahead with it. The U.S. Congress has actually set up an Office of
Technology Assessment. This new agency is expected to be able to predict
what new technologies are likely co become important, and what long-
range effects they are likely to have. It is then expected to advise
government what new technologies to encourage and what new technologies
to discourage, if not to forbid alto- gether.</p>
<p>This attempt can end only in fiasco. Technology assessment of this
kind is likely to lead to the encouragement of the wrong technologies
and the discouragement of the tech- nologies we need. For future impacts
of new technology are almost always beyond any- body’s imagination.</p>
<p>DDT is an example. It was synthesized during World War II to protect
American sol- diers against disease-carrying insects, especially in the
tropics. Some of the scientists then envisaged the use of the new
chemical to protect civilian populations as well. But not one</p>
<p>of the many men who worked on DDT thought of applying the new
pesticide to control insect pests infesting crops, forests, or
livestock. If DDT had been restricted to the use for which it was
developed, that is, to the protection of humans, it would never have
become an environmental hazard; use for this purpose accounted for no
more than 5 or 10 percent of the total at DDT’s peak, in the
mid-sixties. Farmers and foresters, without much help from the
scientists, saw that what killed lice on men would also kill lice on
plants and made DDT into a massive assault on the environment.</p>
<p>Another example is the population explosion in the developing
countries. DDT and other pesticides were a factor in it. So were the new
antibiotics. Yet the two were devel- oped quite independently of each
other; and no one “assessing” either technology could have foreseen
their convergence—indeed no one did. But more important as causative
factors in the sharp drop in infant mortality which set off the
population explosion were two very old “technologies” to which no one
paid any attention. One was the elementary public-health measure of
keeping latrine and well apart—known to the Macedonians be- fore
Alexander the Great. The other one was the wire-mesh screen for doors
and windows invented by an unknown American around 1860. Both were
suddenly adopted even by backward tropical villages after World War II.
Together they were probably the main causes of the population
explosion.</p>
<p>At the same time, the technology impacts which the experts predict
almost never oc- cur. One example is the “private flying boom,” which
the experts predicted during and shortly after World War II. The private
plane, owner-piloted, would become as common, we were told, as the Model
T automobile had become after World War I. Indeed, experts among city
planners, engineers, and architects advised New York City not to go
ahead with the second tube of the Lincoln Tunnel, or with the second
deck on the George Wash- ington Bridge, and instead to build a number of
small airports along the west bank of the Hudson River. It would have
taken fairly elementary mathematics to disprove this particu- lar
technology assessment—there just is not enough airspace for commuter
traffic by air. But this did not occur to any of the experts; no one
then realized how finite airspace is. At the same time, almost no
experts foresaw the expansion of commercial air traffic and an-
ticipated, at the time the jet plane was first developed, that it would
lead to mass transpor- tation by air, with as many people crossing the
Atlantic in jumbo jets in one day as used to go in a week in the big
passenger liners. To be sure, transatlantic travel was expected to grow
fast—but of course it would be by ship. These were the years in which
all the gov- ernments along the North Atlantic heavily subsidized the
building of new super-luxury liners, just when the passengers deserted
the liner and switched to the new jet plane.</p>
<p>A few years later, we were told by everybody that automation would
have tremendous economic and social impacts—it has had practically none.
The computer offers an even odder story. In the late forties nobody
predicted that the computer would be used by busi- ness and governments.
While the computer was a “major scientific revolution,” every- body
“knew” that its main use would be in science and warfare. As a result,
the most ex- tensive market research study undertaken at that time
reached the conclusion that the world computer market would, at most, be
able to absorb 1,000 computers by the year</p>
<ol start="2000" type="1">
<li>Now, only twenty-five years later, there are some 150,000 computers
installed in the world, most of them doing the most mundane bookkeeping
work. Then a few years later, when it became apparent that business was
buying computers for payroll and billing, the experts predicted that the
computer would displace middle management, so that there would be nobody
left between the chief executive officer and the foreman. “Is middle
management obsolete?” asked a widely quoted Harvard Business Review
article in the early fifties; and it, answered this rhetorical question
with a resounding “Yes.” At exactly that moment, the tremendous
expansion of middle-management jobs began. In every de- veloped country
middle-management jobs, in business as well as in government, have grown
about three times as fast as total employment in the last twenty years;
and their growth has been parallel to the growth of computer usage.
Anyone depending on technol- ogy assessment in the early 1950s would
have abolished the graduate business schools as likely to produce
graduates who could not possibly find jobs. Fortunately, the young
peo-</li>
</ol>
<p>ple did not listen and flocked in record numbers to the graduate
business schools so as to get the good jobs which the computer helped
create. (For the middle-management boom, see Chapter 35.)</p>
<p>But while no one foresaw the computer impact on middle-management
jobs, every expert predicted a tremendous computer impact on business
strategy, business policy, planning, and top management—on none of which
the computer has, however, had the slightest impact at all. At the same
time, no one predicted the real revolution in business policy and
strategy in the fifties and sixties, the merger wave and the
conglomerates.</p>
<p>It is not only that man has the gift of prophecy no more with respect
to technology than with respect to anything else. The impacts of
technology are actually more difficult to predict than most other
developments. In the first place, as the example of the popula- tion
explosion shows, social and economic impact are almost always the result
of the con- vergence of a substantial number of factors, not all of them
technological. And each of these factors has its own origin, its own
development, its own dynamics, and its own ex- perts. The expert in one
field—e.g. the expert on epidemiology—never thinks of plant pests. The
expert on antibiotics is concerned with the treatment of disease,
whereas the actual explosion of the birthrate resulted largely from
elementary and long-known public health measures.</p>
<p>But equally important, what technology is likely to become important
and have an im- pact, and what technology either will fizzle out—like
the “flying Model T”—or will have minimal social or economic
impacts—like automation—is impossible to predict. And which technology
will have social impacts and which will remain just technology is even
harder to predict. The most successful prophet of technology, Jules
Verne, predicted a great deal of twentieth-century technology a hundred
years ago (though few scientists or technologists of that time took him
seriously). But he anticipated absolutely no social or economic impacts,
only an unchanged mid-Victorian society and economy. Economic and social
prophets, in turn, have the most dismal record as predictors of
technology.</p>
<p>The one and only effect an Office of Technology Assessment is
therefore likely to have would be to guarantee full employment to a lot
of fifth-rate science-fiction writers.</p>
<p>The Need for Technology Monitoring</p>
<p>The major danger is, however, that the delusion that we can foresee
the impacts of new technology will lead us to slight the really
important task, For technology does have im- pacts and serious ones,
beneficial as well as detrimental. These do not require prophecy. They
require careful monitoring of the actual impact of a technology once it
has become effective. In 1948, practically no one correctly saw the
impacts of the computer. Five or six years later, one could and did
know. Then one could say, “Whatever the technological impact, socially
and economically this is not a major threat.” In 1943, no one could pre-
dict the impact of DDT. Ten years later, DDT had become worldwide a tool
of farmer, forester, and livestock breeder, and as such, a major
ecological factor. Then thinking as to what action to take should have
begun, work should have been started on the development of pesticides
without the major environmental impact of DDT, and the difficult
trade-offs should have been faced between food production and
environmental damage—which nei- ther the unlimited use nor the present
complete ban on DDT sufficiently considers.</p>
<p>Technology monitoring is a serious, an important, indeed a vital
task. But it is not prophecy. The only thing possible with respect to
new technology is speculation with about one chance out of a hundred of
being right—and a much better chance of doing harm by encouraging the
wrong, or discouraging the most beneficial new technology. What needs to
be watched is “developing” technology, that is, technology which has al-
ready had substantial impacts, enough to be judged, to be measured, to
be evaluated.</p>
<p>And monitoring a developing technology for its social impacts is,
above all, a mana- gerial responsibility.</p>
<p>But equally important—and totally overlooked by the advocates of
technology as- sessment—are the impacts of non-technological, that is
social and economic innovations</p>
<p>and developments. They are just as hard to predict until they have
emerged and can be identified, evaluated, and measured. They too,
therefore, need being monitored. And that too is a management
responsibility.</p>
<p>How to Deal with Impacts</p>
<p>Identifying incidental impacts of an institution is the first step.
But how does management deal with them? The objective is clear: impacts
on society and economy, community, and individual that are not in
themselves the purpose and mission of the institution should be kept to
the minimum and should preferably be eliminated altogether. The fewer
such im- pacts the better, whether the impact is within the institution,
on the social environment, or on the physical environment.</p>
<p>Wherever an impact can be eliminated by dropping the activity that
causes it, this is therefore the best—indeed the only truly
good-solution.</p>
<p>Managerial authority over, and control of, work-community affairs is
perhaps the one area where this can be done—and with direct benefit to
institution and management them- selves.</p>
<p>In most cases the activity cannot, however, be eliminated. Hence
there is need for sys- tematic work at eliminating the impact—or at
least at minimizing it—while maintaining the underlying activity
itself.</p>
<p>The ideal approach is to make the elimination of impacts into a
profitable business opportunity. One example is the way Dow Chemical,
one of the leading U.S. chemical companies, has for almost twenty years
tackled air and water pollution. Dow decided, shortly after World War
II, that air and water pollution was an undesirable impact that had to
be eliminated. Long before the public outcry about the environment, Dow
adopted a zero pollution policy for its plants. It then set about
systematically to develop the pollut- ing substances it removes from
smokestack gases and watery effluents into salable prod- ucts and to
create uses and markets for them.</p>
<p>A variant is the Du Pont Industrial Toxicity Laboratory. Du Pont, in
the 1920s, be- came aware of the toxic side effects of many of its
industrial products, set up a laboratory to test for toxicity and to
develop processes to eliminate the poisons. Du Pont started out to
eliminate an impact which at that time every other chemical manufacturer
took for granted. But then Du Pont decided to develop toxicity control
of industrial products into a separate business. The Industrial Toxicity
Laboratory works not only for Du Pont but for a wide variety of
customers for whom it develops nonpoisonous compounds, whose prod- ucts
it tests for toxicity, and so on. Again, an impact has been eliminated
by making it into a business opportunity.</p>
<p>When Regulation is Needed</p>
<p>To make elimination of an impact into a business opportunity shou1d
always be at- tempted. But it cannot be done in many cases. More often
eliminating an impact means increasing the costs. What was an
“externality” for which the general public paid becomes business cost.
It therefore becomes a competitive disadvantage unless everybody in the
industry accepts the same rule. And this, in most cases, can be done
only by regulation— that means by same form of public action.</p>
<p>Whenever an impact cannot be eliminated without an increase in cost,
it becomes in- cumbent upon management to think ahead and work out the
regulation which is most likely to solve the problem at the minimum cost
and with the greatest benefit to public and business alike. And it is
then management’s job to work at getting the right regulation
enacted.</p>
<p>Management—and not only business management—has shunned this
responsibility.</p>
<p>The traditional attitude has always been that “no regulation is the
best regulation.” But this applies only when an impact can be made into
a business opportunity. Where elimina- tion of an impact requires a
restriction, regulation is in the interest of business, and espe- cially
in the interest of responsible business. Otherwise it will be penalized
as “irresponsi-</p>
<p>ble,” while the unscrupulous, the greedy, the stupid, and the
chiseler cash in. And to ex- pect that there will be no regulation is
willful blindness.</p>
<p>Whenever there bas been the kind of crisis which the automobile
industry ran into with respect to automotive safety or the public
utilities with respect to air pollution, the penalty imposed on business
in the end has been high. Such a crisis always leads to a scandal. It
leads to governmental inquisition, to angry editorials, and eventually
to loss of confidence in an entire industry, its management, and its
products by broad sectors of the public. Finally, there is punitive
legislation.</p>
<p>The fact that the public today sees no issue is not relevant. Indeed
it is not even rele- vant that the public today—as it did in every
single one of the examples above—resists actively any attempts on the
part of farsighted business leaders to prevent a crisis. In the end,
there is the scandal.</p>
<p>One example is the failure of the international petroleum companies
to think ahead and develop the successor to the “petroleum concession,”
the impacts of which could clearly be anticipated at the end of World
War II. Another example is the failure of U.S. industry to think through
the regulation of foreign investment which Canada might adopt to
preserve both political identity and access to capital (for both
examples, see Chapter 59).</p>
<p>The American pharmaceutical industry knew, as early as 1955, that the
existing rules and procedures to test new drugs were not working. They
had been written long before the arrival of the modern potent wonder
drugs and their—equally potent—side effects. Yet any pharmaceutical
company that tried to get the industry to face up to the problem was
shushed by the other members of the club. “Don’t rock the boat,” the
prospective innovator was told. One company, it is reported, actually
worked up a comprehensive new approach and new regulatory procedures. It
was prevailed upon to bury them in its ar- chives.</p>
<p>And then came the Thalidomide scandal. It actually proved the
effectiveness of the American control system; for while Thalidomide was
approved for medical practice in the European countries; the U.S.
regulatory authorities became concerned very early about the drug’s
toxic side effects and withheld approval. As a result there are no
deformed Thalidomide babies in the U.S. as there are in Germany, Sweden,
and England. Still, the scandal released an enormous tidal wave of
anxiety about drug testing and drug safety in the U.S. And because
industry had not faced up to the problem and had not thought through and
agitated for the right solution, Congress panicked into passing
legislation that threatens seriously to impair the development and
market introduction of new medi- cines—and yet, paradoxically, would
probably not prevent another Thalidomide.</p>
<p>Yet business does not seem to learn the lesson. Business will only
have itself to blame if legislation impairs or undermines the private
pension system in the U.S. Since the 1940s, when pension plans first
came into wide use in American business, managements have known that
most pension plans have two major undesirable impacts. First they pe-
nalize an employee who moves to another employer, even if the move is
involuntary and the result of being laid off. Second, they do not
protect the employee in the event of bank- ruptcy and liquidation of his
employer, or at least not in the majority of private pension plans. It
would have been relatively easy and cheap to take care of these two side
effects. But it would have been unpopular to raise the issues,
especially in the unionized com- pany. Management therefore evaded the
problem. As a result, the pension system of American business is in
danger of being restricted, if not legislated out of existence. And the
costs of pensions to the employing business will, in all likelihood, go
up sharply, way beyond what would have been needed to give the employees
the protection they need.</p>
<p>The Trade-Offs</p>
<p>Any solution to an impact problem requires trade-offs. Beyond a
certain level elimination of an impact costs more in money or in energy,
in resources or in lives, than the attainable benefit. A decision has to
be made on the optimal balance between costs and benefits.</p>
<p>This is something people in an industry understand, as a rule. But no
one outside does— and so the outsider’s solution tends to ignore the
trade-off problem altogether.</p>
<p>Where is the trade-off between the overdue concern for a natural
environment threat- ened by the strip-mining of coal and the lives saved
in switching from underground min- ing to strip-mining? Underground
mining can never be truly safe. It will also always re- main a health
hazard because of the coal dust and the contaminated air in which under-
ground work has to be performed. Strip-mining, on the other hand, should
be a fairly safe occupation and has few health hazards. But where is the
trade-off between lives and natu- ral beauty and clean, unpolluted
streams?</p>
<p>But there is, in the strip-mining issue, also a trade-off between the
costs of environ- mental damage and the cost in jobs, living standards,
and in the health hazard of cold homes and the safety hazards of dark
streets implicit in dear and scarce energy.</p>
<p>What happens if management fails to face up to an impact and to think
through the trade-off is illustrated by the American experience with the
control of automotive emis- sions.</p>
<p>That such controls would be needed has been known since the end of
World War II when smog first became a household word in Los Angeles. The
automobile industry, however, relied on public relations, which told it
that the public was not concerned about smog. Then, suddenly, in the
sixties, the public panicked and forced through drastic emis-
sion-control legislation. Whether the new controls will actually cut
pollution is quite doubtful. They control emissions in new cars, but are
unlikely to control emissions in the great majority of cars on the road,
which are more than two to three years old. One thing is, however,
certain. These emission controls will themselves cause substantial new
pollu- tion. They greatly increase the energy needed to drive the car
and will therefore have to use more gasoline. This will require more
petroleum refining—one of the most polluting of industrial activities.
At the same time, they will add very substantially to the cost of the
car and of automotive service. What the right trade-offs would have been
we do not know—for industry did not do its work. But both industry and
public will pay and suffer.</p>
<p>The public welcomes an intelligent solution for such a problem if
management presses for one before the scandal. This has been the
experience of the Committee for Economic Development (CED) in its twenty
years of existence, and of any other business or industry group which
took responsibility for an impact and brought to bear on it the
knowledge, competence, and seriousness of its best people.</p>
<p>Most managers know this. And yet, they hope against hope that the
problem will go away. They postpone thinking about it, let alone taking
action. At the most they make speeches. And they fight a rearguard
action after they have lost.</p>
<p>Responsibility for social impacts is a management responsibility—not
because it is a social responsibility, but because it is a business
responsibility. The ideal is to make elimination of such an impact into
a business opportunity. But wherever that cannot be done, the design of
the appropriate regulation with the optimal trade-off balance—and public
discussion of the problem and promotion of the best regulatory
solution—is man- agement’s job.</p>
<p>Social Problems as Business Opportunities</p>
<p>Social problems are dysfunctions of society and—at least
potentially—degenerative dis- eases of the body politic. They are ills.
But for the management of institutions, and, above all, for business
management they represent challenges. They are major sources of oppor-
tunity. For it is the function of business—and to a lesser degree of the
other main institu- tions—to satisfy a social need and at the same time
serve their institution, by making reso- lution of a social problem into
a business opportunity.</p>
<p>It is the job of business to convert change into innovation, that is,
into new business.</p>
<p>And it is a poor businessman who thinks that innovation refers to
technology alone. Social change and social innovation have throughout
business history been at least as important as technology. After all,
the major industries of the nineteenth century were, to a very</p>
<p>large extent, the result of converting the new social environment—the
industrial city— into a business opportunity and into a business market.
This underlay the rise of lighting, first by gas and then by
electricity, of the streetcar and the interurban trolley, of telephone,
newspaper, and department store—to name only a few.</p>
<p>The most significant opportunities for converting social problems
into business oppor- tunities may therefore not be in new technologies,
new products, and new services. They may be in solving the social
problem, that is, in social innovation which then directly and
indirectly benefits and strengthens the company, or the industry.</p>
<p>The success of some of the most successful businesses is largely the
result of such so- cial innovation. Here are some American examples:</p>
<p>Julius Rosenwald, the “city slicker” who built Sears, Roebuck,
invented and for many years financed the Country Farm Agent. The social
problem he identified was the poverty, ignorance, and isolation of the
American farmer who still, in the early years of this cen- tury,
constituted half the U.S. population. Knowledge to enable the farmer to
produce more, to produce the right things, and to get more for his
efforts was available. But it was inaccessible to the farmer. The County
Farm Agent—rather than new technology, new machines, or new seeds—became
a main force behind the “productivity explosion” on the American farm.
Rosenwald saw a genuine social problem. But he also saw a genuine
business opportunity. For the farmer’s poverty, ignorance, and isolation
were major ob- stacles to Sears. As the farmer’s position and income
grew, so did the Sears market. And Sears came to be identified by the
farmers as the “farmer’s friend.”</p>
<p>Tackling a social problem as a business opportunity also played a
substantial part in the meteoric rise of Ford in its early days.</p>
<p>The years immediately, prior to World War I were years of great labor
unrest in the United States, growing labor bitterness, and high
unemployment. Hourly wages for skilled men ran as low as 15 cents in
many cases. It was against this background that the Ford Motor Company,
in the closing days of 1913, announced that it would pay a guaranteed
-a-day wage to every one of its workers—two to three times what was then
standard. James Couzens, the company’s general manager, who had forced
this decision on his re- luctant partner Henry Ford, knew perfectly well
that his company’s wage bill would al- most triple overnight. But he
became convinced that the workmen’s sufferings were so great that only
radical and highly visible action could have an effect. Couzens also ex-
pected that Ford’s actual labor cost, despite the tripling of the wage
rate, would go down—and events soon proved him right. Before Ford
changed the whole labor economy of the United States with one
announcement, labor turnover at the Ford Motor Company had been so high
that, in 1912, 60,000 men had to be hired to retain 10,000 workers. With
the new wage, turnover almost disappeared. The resulting savings were so
great that de- spite sharply rising costs for all materials in the next
few years, Ford could produce and sell its Model T at a lower price and
yet make a larger profit per car. It was the saving in labor cost
produced by a drastically, higher wage that gave Ford market domination.
At the same time Ford’s action transformed American industrial society.
It established the American workingman as fundamentally middle
class.</p>
<p>IBM also owes its rise largely, to a frontal attack on a social
problem. During the years of the Great Depression IBM was a very small
company and had little visibility. Hence its action had none of the
impact of Ford’s -a-day wage twenty years earlier. Yet in giving workers
employment security and then putting them on a salary instead of an
hourly wage (as related in Chapter 20) IBM was as bold and innovative as
Ford had been. IBM’s action too was aimed at a major social problem of
the time, the fear, insecurity, and loss of dignity that the Depression
inflicted on workers in America. It too turned a social disease into a
business opportunity. It was this action, above all, which created the
human potential for IBM’s rapid growth and, then, a decade later, for
its aggressive move into the totally new computer technology.</p>
<p>And here is a European example. The growth of Olivetti into one of
the world’s lead- ing producers of office equipment rests on two
insights of the late Adriano Olivetti, who, in the 1920s, inherited a
small, unknown, and barely viable family company in the small</p>
<p>town of Ivrea in northern Italy. Adriano Olivetti saw the opportunity
to give his company and his products distinction through good design.
Olivetti’s design gave him market rec- ognition within a decade. He also
saw in Italy’s corrosive class hatred an opportunity. The community in
which he tried to fuse management and worker in Ivrea gave him excep-
tional labor productivity, high-quality production, and a work force
willing to accept new technology and changes—and with it competitive
strength and profitability.</p>
<p>In present-day society one area where a serious problem might be
solved by making it into an opportunity could well be the fatigue,
frustration, and “burning-out” of the middle- aged knowledge worker and
his need for a second career.* The hidden cost of the middle- aged
knowledge workers—managers and knowledge professionals—who have “retired
on the job,” have lost interest, and just go through the motions, may
well be larger than that of Ford’s labor turnover in 1913. At the same
time, the frustrations and silent despair of these men and women may
pose as great a social danger to society as the misery, bitter- ness,
and despair of the suffering manual worker of yesterday. Nothing is as
corrosive as success turned into frustration. The first company which
tackles this problem as both a social problem and an opportunity might
well reap benefits fully as great as those reaped by Ford sixty years
ago and Olivetti and IBM forty years ago.</p>
<p>To cure social ills by making them into opportunities for
contribution and perform- ance is by no means a challenge to business
enterprise alone. It is the responsibility as well of all the other
institutions of our society of organizations.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of talk today about the crisis of the
university; and the crisis is real. In some places, however, it has been
seized as an opportunity. In Great Britain there is the Open University,
which uses television to make university education available to anyone
who is willing to do the work. In California the medium-sized and
little-known University of the Pacific, in Stockton, is building a new
kind of university. It utilizes the desire of young people to learn but
also to be responsible participants in their learning.</p>
<p>Rosenwald, Ford, IBM’s Watson, and Olivetti were all initially
ridiculed as visionar- ies. No one could solve the problems they
tackled, they were told. Ten or fifteen years later, their solutions
were dismissed as “obvious.” The right solution is always obvious in
retrospect. What matters is that these men and their companies
identified a major social problem and asked, “How can it be solved as a
business opportunity?”</p>
<p>Any business, and indeed any institution, needs to organize
innovative efforts to con- vert social problems into opportunities for
performance and contribution.</p>
<p>In the last quarter century organized technological research has
become common- place. Social innovation is still largely left to chance
and to the individual entrepreneur who stumbles upon an opportunity.
This is no longer adequate. In the society of organiza- tions, every
institution needs to organize its RandandandandD for society and
community fully as much as it had been organizing it for technology.
Management has to organize to identify the issues, the crises, the
problems in society and community, and to work at the innova- tions that
will make their solution into a profitable opportunity.</p>
<p>The “Degenerative Diseases” of Society</p>
<p>Social problems that management action converts into opportunities
soon cease to be problems. The others, however, are likely to become
“chronic complaints,” if not “degen- erative diseases.”</p>
<p>Not every social problem can be resolved by making it into an
opportunity for contri- bution and performance. Indeed, the most serious
of such problems tend to defy this ap- proach.</p>
<p>No business could, for instance, have done much about America’s most
serious de- generative disease throughout our history—the racial
problem. It could not even be tack- led until the whole society had
changed awareness and convictions—by which time it was very late, if not
altogether too late. And even if one management solves such a
problem,</p>
<p>*On this see my book, The Age of Discontinuity, especially Chapter
13.</p>
<p>the rest may not follow. There may be a solution; but while known and
visible, it is not being used. The problem stays acute and
unresolved.</p>
<p>American business had to follow Ford’s lead between 1914 and
1920—though the la- bor shortage of World War I had as much to do with
this as Ford’s example. But few American companies imitated IBM and even
fewer Italian companies imitated Olivetti, despite their visible
success.</p>
<p>What then is the social responsibility of management for these social
problems that become chronic or degenerative diseases?</p>
<p>They are management’s problems. The health of the enterprise is
management’s re- sponsibility. A healthy business and a sick society are
hardly compatible. Healthy busi- nesses require a healthy, or at least a
functioning, society. The health of the community is a prerequisite for
successful and growing business.</p>
<p>And it is foolish to hope that these problems will disappear if only
one looks the other way. Problems go away because someone does something
about them.</p>
<p>With any such problem, management had better find out whether someone
has, in fact, done something that works. That few, if any, U.S.
businesses have followed IBM, few Italian businesses have followed
Olivetti, and few German businesses have followed Zeiss is management
failure. It is basically not too different from the management failure
to keep technology and products competitive. And the reasons are not too
different either; they are shortsightedness, indolence, and
incompetence.</p>
<p>Yet there remain the big, tough, dangerous dysfunctions of society,
the social prob- lems for which no one has worked out a solution, and
which cannot, it seems, be resolved, or perhaps not even assuaged, by
being made performance opportunities.</p>
<p>To what extent should business—or any other of the special-purpose
institutions of our society—be expected to tackle such a problem which
did not arise out of an impact of theirs and which cannot be converted
into an opportunity for performance of the institu- tion’s purpose and
mission? To what extent should these institutions, business, university,
or hospital, even be permitted to take responsibility?</p>
<p>Today’s rhetoric tends to ignore that question. “Here is,” Mayor
Lindsay of New York says, “the Black ghetto. No one knows what to do
with it. Whatever government, social workers, or community action try,
things seem only to get worse. Therefore big business better take
responsibility.”</p>
<p>That Mayor Lindsay frantically looks for someone to take over is
understandable and the problem that is defeating him is indeed desperate
and a major threat to his city, to American society, and to the Western
world altogether. But is it enough to make the prob- lem of the Black
ghetto the social responsibility of management? Or are there limits to
social responsibility? And what are they?</p>
<h4 id="the-limits-of-social-responsibility">26 The Limits of Social
Responsibility</h4>
<p>Management’s First Responsibility: Its Own Institution—The Need to
Know Minimum Profitability Requirements—To “Do Good” and to “Do
Well”—The Limits of Com- petence—The Limitations of One’s Value
System—The Areas of Incompetence—The Limits of Authority—No

Central Problem to Management and to the Society of Organizations</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>HE MANAGER IS A SERVANT. His master is the institution he manages and
his first responsibility must therefore be to it. His first task is to
make the institution, whether business, hospital, school, or university,
perform the function and make the contribution for the sake of which it
exists. The man who uses his position at the head of a major institution
to become a public figure and to take leadership with respect to social
problems, while his company or his university erodes through neglect, is
not a statesman. He is irresponsible and false to his trust.</p>
<p>The institution’s performance of its specific mission is also
society’s first need and in- terest. Society does not stand to gain but
to lose if the performance capacity of the institu- tion in its own
specific task is diminished or impaired. Performance of its function is
the institution’s first social responsibility. Unless it discharges its
performance responsibly, it cannot discharge anything else. A bankrupt
business is not a desirable employer and is unlikely to be a good
neighbor in a community. Nor will it create the capital for tomor- row’s
jobs and the opportunities for tomorrow’s workers. A university which
fails to pre- pare tomorrow’s leaders and professionals is not socially
responsible, no matter how many “good works” it engages in.</p>
<p>The first “limitation” on social responsibility is, therefore, the
higher responsibility for the specific performance of the institution
which is the manager’s master. This needs par- ticular stress with
respect to the business enterprise, the economic institution of society.
Any solution of a social impact or of a social problem except to make it
into an opportu- nity for performance and results creates social
overhead costs. These costs cannot be borne out of profits, no matter
what popular rhetoric may say. They are paid for either out of current
costs—that is, by consumer or taxpayer—or they are paid for out of
capital— that is, by fewer and poorer jobs tomorrow and impaired
standards of living. The only way to cover ccsts and to accumulate
capital is through economic performance. All other satisfactions of
society are being paid for, one way or another, out of the surplus
between current production and current consumption, that is, out of the
surplus of the economy.</p>
<p>This again underscores the responsibility of managers to anticipate
problems and to think through the trade-offs involved in their
solutions. At what point does a solution be- come prohibitively
expensive for society because it impairs the performance capacity of
existing and needed institutions, whether of the economy, of health
care, of education, or of the military? What is the optimal balance
between the need to take care of a social problem and the need to
preserve the performance capacity of the existing social institu-</p>
<p>tions? And at what point does one risk losing social performance—and
thereby creating new and bigger problems—by overloading the existing
institutions? At what point do we achieve the best balance between the
old costs and the new benefits?</p>
<p>Managers need to be able to think through the limits on social
responsibility set by their duty to the performance capacity of the
enterprises in their charge.</p>
<p>In the case of the business enterprise this requires knowing the
objectives in the key areas (see Chapters 8 and 9). For these objectives
set the minimum performance goals for the attainment of the enterprise’s
mission. As long as they can be attained, the enterprise can perform. If
the objective in any one area is seriously jeopardized, the performance
capacity of the entire business is endangered.</p>
<p>Above all, management needs to know the minimum profitability
required by the risks of the business and by its commitments to the
future. It needs this knowledge for its own decisions. But it needs it
just as much to explain its decisions to others—the politicians, the
press, the public. As long as managements remain the prisoners of their
own ignorance of the objective need for, and function of, profit—i.e. as
long as they think and argue in terms of the “profit motive”—they will
be able neither to make rational decisions with respect to social
responsibilities, nor to explain these decisions to others inside and
out- side the business.</p>
<p>A popular pun these days says, “It is not enough for business to do
well; it must also do good.” But in order to “do good,” a business must
first “do well” (and indeed “do very</p>
<p>well”).</p>
<p>Whenever a business has disregarded the limitation of economic
performance and has assumed social responsibilities which it could not
support economically it has soon gotten</p>
<p>into trouble.</p>
<p>Union Carbide was not socially responsible when it put its plant into
Vienna, West Virginia, to alleviate unemployment there. It was, in fact,
irresponsible. The plant was marginal to begin with. The process was
obsolescent. At best the plant could barely keep its head above water.
And this, inevitably, meant a plant unable to take on social respon-
sibility, even for its own impacts. Because the plant was uneconomical
to begin with, Un- ion Carbide resisted so long all demands to clean it
up. This particular demand could not have been foreseen in the late
1940s when concern with jobs far outweighed any concern for the
environment. But demands of some kind can always be expected. To do
something out of social responsibility which is economically irrational
and untenable is therefore never responsible. It is sentimental. The
result is always greater damage.</p>
<p>Similarly, Deltec in Buenos Aires may be vulnerable to the charge
that to keep a plant open when every other major meat-packer had reached
the conclusion that the business could not survive was sentimentality
rather than social responsibility. It was an assump- tion of
responsibility beyond tenable limits. The intentions were good and
honorable—as in Union Carbide’s case. It may be argued that Deltec took
a calculated risk. Also, the outcome was far more the result of internal
Argentinean politics than of anything Deltec did or omitted to do. Yet
Deltec management took a greater risk than might be compatible with true
social responsibility.</p>
<p>The same limitation on social responsibility applies to non-economic
institutions.</p>
<p>There, too, the manager is duty-bound to preserve the performance
capacity of the institu- tion in his care. To jeopardize it, no matter
how noble the motive, is irresponsibility. These institutions too are
capital assets of society on the performance of which society
depends.</p>
<p>This, to be sure, is a very unpopular position to take. It is much
more popular to be “progressive.” But managers, and especially managers
of key institutions of society, are not being paid to be heroes to the
popular press. They are being paid for performance and
responsibility.</p>
<p>The Limits of Competence</p>
<p>To take on tasks for which one lacks competence is irresponsible
behavior. It is also cruel. It raises expectations which will then be
disappointed.</p>
<p>In particular an institution better refrain from tackling tasks which
do not fit into its value system (on this see also Chapter 58, “Managing
Diversity). Skills and knowledge are fairly easily acquired. But one
cannot easily change personality. No one is likely to do well in areas
which he does not respect. If a business or any other institution
tackles such an area because there is a social need, it is unlikely to
put its good people on the task and to support them adequately. It is
unlikely to understand what the task involves. It is almost certain to
do the wrong things. As a result, it will do damage rather than
good.</p>
<p>What not to do was demonstrated when the American universities in the
sixties rushed into taking social responsibility for the problems of the
big city. These problems are rea1 enough. And within the university were
to be found able scholars in a variety of areas with relevance to the
problems. Yet the tasks were primarily political tasks. The values
involved were those of the politician rather than the scholar. The
skills needed were those of compromise, of mobilizing energies, and
above all, of setting priorities. And these are not skills which the
academician admires and respects, let alone excels in. They are al- most
the opposite of the objectivity and the “finding of truth” which
constitute excellence in academia. These tasks exceeded the competence
of the university and were incompati- ble with its value system.</p>
<p>The result of the universities’ eager acceptance of these tasks was
therefore, inevita- bly, lack of performance and results. It was also
damage to the prestige and standing of the university, and to its
credibility. The universities did not help the problems of the city; but
they seriously impaired their own performance capacity in their own
area.</p>
<p>The major corporations in New York City would have acted totally
irresponsibly had they responded to Mayor Lindsay’s call to “adopt the
Black ghetto.” All they could have done (as they apparently realized)
was damage—to the ghetto and to themselves.</p>
<p>What the limits of competence depends in part on circumstances. If a
member of a climbing team develops acute appendicitis in the high
Himalayas and is almost certain to die unless operated on, any medical
man in the group will operate, even though he may be a dermatologist who
has never done a single operation in his life. The dermatologist, though
a qualified physician, will be considered irresponsible and vulnerable
to both a malpractice suit and a conviction for manslaughter, should he
operate on an appendix in a place where a qualified surgeon, or even a
general practitioner, are within reach.</p>
<p>Management therefore needs to know at the very least what it and its
institution are truly incompetent for. Business, as a rule, will be in
this position of absolute incompe- tence in an “intangible” area. The
strength of business is accountability and measurability. It is the
discipline of market test, productivity measurements, and profitability
require- ment. Where these are lacking businesses are essentially out of
their depth. They are also out of fundamental sympathy, that is, outside
their own value systems. Where the criteria of performance are
intangible, such as “political” opinions and emotions, community ap-
proval or disapproval, mobilization of community energies and
structuring of power rela- tions, business is unlikely to feel
comfortable. It is unlikely to have respect for the values that matter.
It is, therefore, most unlikely to have competence.</p>
<p>In such areas it is, however, often possible to define goals clearly
and measurably for specific partial tasks. It is often possible to
convert parts of a problem that by itself lies outside the competence of
business into work that fits the competence and value system of the
business enterprise.</p>
<p>No one in America has done very well in training hard-core
unemployable Black teen- agers for work and jobs. But business has done
far less badly than any other institution: schools, government programs,
community agencies. This task can be identified. It can be</p>
<p>defined. Goals can be set. And performance can be measured. And then
business can per- form.</p>
<p>Before acceding to the demand that it take on this or that social
responsibility, and go to work on this or that problem, management
better think through what, if any, part of the task can be made to fit
the competence of its institution. Is there any area which can be
defined in terms of tangible goals and measurable performance—as
business managers understand these slippery terms? If the answer is yes,
one is justified in thinking seriously about one’s social
responsibility. But when the answer is no—and this will be the answer in
a good many areas—business enterprise better resist, no matter how
important the problem and how urgent the demand for business to take it
over. It can only do harm to society and to itself. It cannot perform
and therefore cannot be responsible.</p>
<p>The Limits of Authority</p>
<p>The most important limitation on social responsibility is the
limitation of authority. The constitutional lawyer knows that there is
no such word as “responsibility” in the political dictionary. The term
is “responsibility and authority.” Whoever claims authority thereby
assumes responsibility. But whoever assumes responsibility thereby
claims authority. The two are but different sides of the same coin. To
assume social responsibility therefore always means to claim
authority.</p>
<p>Again, the question of authority as a limit on social responsibility
does not arise in connection with the impacts of an institution. For the
impact is the result of an exercise of authority, even though purely
incidental and unintended. And then responsibility follows.</p>
<p>But where business or any other institution of our society of
organizations is asked to assume social responsibility for one of the
problems or ills of society and community, management needs to think
through whether the authority implied in the responsibility is
legitimate. Otherwise it is usurpation and irresponsible.</p>
<p>Every time the demand is made that business take responsibility for
this or that, one should ask, “Does business have the authority and
should it have it?” If business does not have and should not have
authority—and in a great many areas it should not have it—then
responsibility on the part of business should be treated with grave
suspicion. It is not re- sponsibility; it is lust for power.</p>
<p>Milton Friedman’s position (see Chapter 24) that business should
stick to its business, that is, to the economic sphere, is not a denial
of responsibility. It is indeed the only con- sistent position in a free
society. It can be argued with great force that any other position can
only undermine and compromise a free society. Any other position can
only mean that business will take over power, authority, and
decision-making in areas outside of the eco- nomic sphere, in areas
which are or should be reserved to government or to the individual or to
other institutions. For, to repeat, whoever assumes responsibility will
soon have to be given the authority. History amply proves this.</p>
<p>From this point of view the present “critics” of big business can
rightly be accused of pushing big business into becoming our master.</p>
<p>Ralph Nader, the American consumerist, sincerely considers himself a
foe of big busi- ness and is accepted as such by business and by the
general public. Insofar as Nader de- mands that business take
responsibility for product quality and product safety, he is surely
concerned with legitimate business responsibility, i.e., with
responsibility for performance and contribution. The only question—apart
from the accuracy of his facts and the style of his campaign—would be
whether Nader’s demand for perfection is not going to cost the consumer
far more than the shortcomings and deficiencies which Nader assails. The
only questions are the trade-offs.</p>
<p>But Ralph Nader demands, above all, that big business assume
responsibility in a mul- titude of areas beyond products and services.
This, if acceded to, can lead only to the emergence of the managements
of the big corporations as the ultimate power in a vast number of areas
that are properly some other institution’s field.</p>
<p>And this is, indeed, the position to which Nader—and other advocates
of unlimited social responsibility—are moving rapidly. One of the Nader
task forces published in 1972 a critique of the Du Pont Company and its
role in the small state of Delaware, where Du Pont has its headquarters
and is a major employer. The report did not even discuss eco- nomic
performance; it dismissed as irrelevant that Du Pont, in a period of
general infla- tion, consistently lowered the prices for its products,
which are, in many cases, basic ma- terials for the American economy.
Instead it sharply criticized Du Pont for not using its economic power
to force the citizens of the state to attack a number of social
problems, from racial discrimination to health care to public schools.
Du Pont, for not taking re- sponsibility for Delaware society, Delaware
politics, and Delaware law, was called grossly remiss in its social
responsibility.</p>
<p>One of the ironies of this story is that the traditional liberal or
left-wing criticism of the Du Pont Company for many years has been the
exact opposite, i.e., that Du Pont, by its very prominence in a small
state, “interferes in and dominates” Delaware and exercises
“illegitimate authority.”</p>
<p>The Nader line is only the best-publicized of the positions which,
under the cover of anti-business rhetoric, actually plead for a society
in which big business is the most pow- erful, the dominant, the ultimate
institution. Of course such an outcome is the opposite of what Nader
intends. But it would not be the first time that a demand for social
responsi- bility has had results opposite from those intended.</p>
<p>The most likely result of the Nader line neither he nor management
would want. It is either a destruction of all authority, that is,
complete irresponsibility. (A parallel would be the way in which the
demand that the barons of early feudal society take social responsi-
bility led around the year 1000 to the complete destruction of the
crown’s authority on the European continent and to the uncontrolled
despotism of the feudal grandees.) Or it is totalitarianism—another form
of irresponsibility.</p>
<p>Yet Milton Friedman’s “pure” position—to eschew all social
responsibility—is not tenable either. There are big, urgent, desperate
problems. Above all, there is the “sickness of government” which is
creating a vacuum of responsibility and performance—a vacuum that
becomes stronger the bigger government becomes. Business and the other
institutions of our society of organizations cannot be pure, however
desirable that may be. Their own self-interest alone forces them to be
concerned with society and community and to be prepared to shoulder
responsibility beyond their own main areas of task and responsibil-
ity.</p>
<p>But in doing this they have to be conscious of the danger—to
themselves and to soci- ety. They have to be conscious of the risk. No
pluralist society such as ours has become, has ever worked unless its
key institutions take responsibility for the common good. But at the
same time, the perennial threat to a pluralist society is the
all-too-easy confusion between the common good and one’s own lust for
power.</p>
<p>In a few areas guidelines can be developed. It is not the task of
business (or of the university) to substitute its authority for that of
the duly constituted political sovereign, the government, in areas that
are clearly national policy. In a free society a business is, of course,
entitled not to engage in activities, even though they are sanctioned
and even en- couraged by governmental policy. It can stay out. But it is
surely not entitled to put itself in the place of government. And it is
not entitled to use its economic power to impose its values on the
community.</p>
<p>By these criteria, the Quaker sage who chided his friend the
steel-mill manager (see Chapter 24) for using the economic power of a
big company to impose a little racial jus- tice on a southern U.S. city
in the 1940s was right. That the end was surely right and moral does not
sanction the means, that is, the exercise of an authority which a
business does not possess. This is as much “imperialism” as any which
the most fervent believer in racial equality denounces. The steel
company can be faulted—deservedly so, I would say—for having done
nothing for long years to work toward the racial justice in which it
professed to believe. It can be faulted, and with cause, for not finding
whatever possibili-</p>
<p>ties for racial justice could have been put into practice. But two
wrongs do not make a right, two examples of irresponsibility do not add
up to responsibility.</p>
<p>By these criteria also the demand that a Swedish company such as ASEA
stay out of a power project in a Portuguese colony in Africa which its
own Swedish socialist govern- ment supports is dubious in logic and in
ethics. A short time ago the “Old Left” used to criticize business as
immoral and irresponsible for sabotaging national policies the Old Left
approved of. It is just as immoral and irresponsible for business to
sabotage national policies of Old Left governments of which the New Left
does not approve.</p>
<p>When to Say No</p>
<p>Demands for social responsibility which in effect ask of business—or
any other institu- tion—that it usurp authority are to be resisted. They
are to be resisted in business’s own self-interest; the usurper’s power
is always shaky. They are to be resisted on grounds of true social
responsibility. For they are, in effect, demands for irresponsibility.
Whether they are made sincerely and out of honest anguish, or whether
they are rhetoric to cloak the lust for power, is irrelevant. Whenever
business, or any other of our institutions, is being asked to take
social responsibility beyond its own area of performance and its own
impact, it better ask itself, “Do we possess authority in the area and
should we have it?” And if the answer is no, then the socially
responsible thing is not to accede to the demand.</p>
<p>Yet in many cases it may not be enough to say no. Management must
resist responsi- bility for a social problem that would compromise or
impair the performance capacity of its business (or its university or
its hospital). It must resist when the demand goes beyond the
institution’s competence. It must resist when responsibility would, in
fact, be illegiti- mate authority. But then, if the problem is a real
one, it better think through and offer an alternative approach. If the
problem is serious, something will ultimately have to be done about it.
And if management then has been purely obstructionist and has blocked
any ap- proach—even though its objection to any one proposed course of
action was legitimate and indeed responsible—the ultimate solution is
likely to do even more damage.</p>
<p>In a pluralist society responsibility for the common good is a
central problem that is never solved. The only way concern for social
responsibility could disappear would be for society to become
totalitarian. For it is the definition of a totalitarian government that
it has authority over everything and responsibility for nothing.</p>
<p>For this reason managements of al1 major institutions, including
business enterprise, need too to concern themselves with serious ills of
society. If at all possible they convert solution of these problems into
an opportunity for performance and contribution. At the least they think
through what the problem is and how it might be tackled. They cannot
escape concern; for this society of organizations has no one else to be
concerned about real problems. In this society managers of institutions
are the leadership group.</p>
<p>But we also know that a developed society needs performing
institutions with their own autonomous management. It cannot function as
a totalitarian society. Indeed, what characterizes a developed
society—and indeed makes it a developed one—is that most of its social
tasks are carried out in and through organized institutions, each with
its own autonomous management. These organizations, including most of
the agencies of our government, are special-purpose institutions. They
are organs of our society for specific performance in a specific area.
The greatest contribution they can make, their greatest social
responsibility, is performance of their function. The greatest social
irresponsibility is to impair the performance capacity of these
institutions by tackling tasks beyond their competence or by usurpation
of authority in the name of social responsibility.</p>

<p>A</p>
<pre><code>CRUCIAL SOCIAL business manager, is</code></pre>
<p>RESPONSIBILITY for the manager, and especially for the the
relationship of business and government. Yet it is rarely</p>
<p>even mentioned when the social responsibilities of management are
being discussed.</p>
<p>Few relationships are as critical to the business enterprise itself
as the relationship to government. The manager has responsibility for
this relationship as part of his responsi- bility to the enterprise
itself. It is an area of social impact of the business. To a large ex-
tent the relationship to government results from what businesses do or
fail to do.</p>
<p>The business-government relationship is also a social problem, for
the relationship be- tween business and government in every major
country is in disrepair. It urgently needs rethinking, reappraisal, and
restructuring. In every developed country—and in most de- veloping
ones—there are no clear rules, little common understanding, and at best
a con- fused patchwork of laws and prejudices, regulations, traditions,
and ad hoc improvisation, ranging from guerrilla warfare to the closest
partnership. At the same time, there are new major problems which cannot
be fitted into the existing relationships. The environment is one. And
so is the multinational corporation.</p>
<p>The increasing confusion threatens government even more than
business. It under- mines its capacity for making policy and giving
direction, that is, its basic institutional integrity. It tempts
governments to tackle far more than they are competent to do. But it
also makes them hesitant and timid in areas where political leadership
is needed (e.g., in the international economy). Yet a competent, clearly
defined, and functioning government is a first need for our complex and
interdependent society.</p>
<p>Ultimately we will need new political theories appropriate to the
realities and needs of the society of organizations. In the meantime,
business and government will have to go on with their respective jobs.
They will have to know which of these jobs have to be tackled together
and which have to be kept apart. It is far too early to think of
solutions. But ap- proaches and specifications will have to be designed,
if only on a case-by-case basis. And great care will have to be taken
lest these interim solutions commit us to the wrong long- term pattern,
foreclose valuable options, and commit society by default to patently
unde- sirable relationships.</p>
<p>To work out these interim solutions and to watch over them will be
primarily the job of the manager. He cannot wait for the political
philosopher. Too much is at stake, for his enterprise, for the economy,
and for society.</p>
<p>To discharge this responsibility the manager needs, above all, to
understand the his- torical background to the government-business
relationship. Political and administrative traditions with respect to
this relationship differ greatly in different countries. They largely
determine what is considered “right” and “appropriate” in individual
countries— by politicians, civil servants, political scientists, but
also by the public and by the busi- nessman himself. These traditions
also explain in large part why the government-business relationship is
in disarray and crisis these days. Yet, few books—whether on government
or on business—have paid much attention to the historical setting and to
the administra- tive and political theories that underlie the
government-business relationship in the devel- oped countries.</p>
<p>The Historical Models</p>
<p>The textbooks still talk of laissez-faire as the model for the
business-government relation- ship in capitalist (i.e., “market”)
economies. But in the first place laissez-faire was a model of economic
theory rather than of political theory and governmental practice. Ex-
cept for Bentham and the young John Stuart Mill, no political writer of
any importance or influence in the last two hundred years paid even lip
service to it. Second, even as an eco- nomic theory laissez-faire was
being practiced in only one country, Great Britain, and only for a
fairly short period in the mid-nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The two political models that have set the norm for the
business-government relation- ship were very different ones. They might
be called, respectively, mercantilism (or, with the French, dirigisme)
and constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Of the two, the mercantilist (or “dirigiste”) model is the older. It
goes back to the sev- enteenth and, especially, the eighteenth century.
It is essentially still the prevailing model for most of continental
Europe, and especially for France. It is the model for the Japanese
relationship between business and government. It has set the pattern in
India, both under the British and since independence. And the
business-government relationship of Com- munist Russia is dirigisme—far
more a continuation of Czarist bureaucratic administra- tion than
revolutionary, and far closer to mercantilism than to Marx.</p>
<p>In the mercantilist model the economy is seen as the foundation of
political sover- eignty and especially of the military strength of the
nation. National economy and national sovereignty are seen as
co-extensive. Both essentially are organized against an outside world.
It is the main function of the economy to provide the means of survival
to the na- tion-state against the threats from the outside. Within the
nation-state there may be fric- tion, conflict, competition, dispute.
But, as in a beleaguered fortress, all disputes and dis- agreements stop
at the wall.</p>
<p>In the original crude concept of mercantilism, as it was developed in
the late seven- teenth century, business was seen as the provider of
specie, i.e., gold and silver, with which to pay the soldiers, who in
turn protected national independence and survival. Adam Smith demolished
the respectability of this line of reasoning. But still, the mercan-
tilist model sees the economic foundation of political sovereignty in
competitive perform- ance abroad. Exports are the objective—and the
test.</p>
<p>It has become fashionable these last few years to speak of “Japan,
Inc.”—that is, of a Japanese system in which government and business are
one in promoting Japanese ex- ports throughout the world. One could have
spoken thus of a “Germany, Inc.” in 1880 or 1900, or of a “France, Inc.”
under De Gaulle.</p>
<p>In the mercantilist model the businessman is considered socially
inferior to the civil servant in government administration. This was as
true in the France of Louis XIV as in Bismarck’s Germany or in Japan
before World War II. Still, the task of the government administrator is
to support, to strengthen, to encourage business, and especially to
support and encourage exports. As the inferiority of businessmen
attenuated—especially with the rise of technology and of the
professional manager—business became, so to speak, a part of the
national establishment. But it is still junior to, though a partner and
in symbiosis with, government.</p>
<p>Symptomatic of this is the position which associations and
organizations of business have in a mercantilist system. In France—and
to a considerable extent; in, Germany— membership in the trade or
industry association is compulsory. In Japan these associations are
quasi-governmental bodies. The trade association official, the executive
secretary for instance, is often a former civil servant of high rank. He
often enjoys more status and power than any but the very biggest and
strongest members of the industry themselves. Labor union agreements are
typically negotiated by the industry association and are then binding on
member companies. But the government also handles its relations with
indus- try and business through trade and industry associations, as it
did, for instance, in the planning process of De Gaulle’s France.</p>
<p>The constitutionalist model developed in the nineteenth century—above
all, in the United States—sees government as standing, essentially, in
an adversary relationship to business. The relationship is governed by
laws rather than administered. It is conducted at arm’s length.</p>
<p>Constitutionalism no more than mercantilism believes in
laissez-faire. It accepts that government cannot stay out of economy and
business. “Business,” both concepts say, “is too important to be left to
the businessmen.” But where the mercantilist guides and directs and pays
subsidies, the constitutionalist says “thou shalt not” and uses
antitrust laws, regu- latory agencies, and criminal indictments. The
mercantilist tries to encourage business, provided it moves in the
direction he deems conducive to national political and military
strength. The constitutionalist is determined to keep business out of
government; it taints. And he sets limits of political morality to
business activity.</p>
<p>While continental Europe is the birthplace of mercantilism, the U.S.
developed consti- tutionalism. Jefferson may be said to have been the
first constitutionalist—deeply suspi- cious of business and convinced
that the business interest had to be kept out of govern- ment. But it
was not until Andrew Jackson, twenty years later, i.e., around 1830,
that con- stitutionalism became the prevailing intellectual model for
business-government relation- ship in the U.S.</p>
<p>It was also during the Jackson Administration that constitutionalism
fixed the social position of the businessman in American life. Since
then businessmen have been socially equal to any group in American
society.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the
United States, the businessman was perhaps the socially dominant figure.
His competitors for social rank were not, as in mercantilist countries,
the civil servants, but the clergy and, later on, the university
professor. In the constitutionalist model, since Jackson’s days, the
businessman is also supposed to be a patriot and available, especially
in times of crisis, to serve the nation and to assume political
leadership positions. And yet, when Franklin D. Roosevelt, a hundred
years after Jackson, called businessmen “malefactors of great wealth,”
he spoke in the purest constitutionalist vein.</p>
<p>Symptomatic for the constitutionalist approach is, again, the
treatment and position of trade and industry associations. In the
constitutionalist tradition they are looked upon with great suspicion
and are rarely used as a conduit for the relations between government
and the business community. They are not compulsory and have no coercive
powers or offi- cial standing, no matter how influential they might be
behind the scenes, e.g., as lobbying groups in Congress.</p>
<p>Symptomatic also is the fact that in the country where
constitutionalism has been most influential, that is the U.S., the
Department of Commerce, i.e., the ministry supposed to represent
business in government and to watch out for the interests of business,
was not set up as a cabinet office until 1913—a hundred to a hundred and
fifty years later than the ministries of commerce in continental
Europe.</p>
<p>Equally symptomatic is the fact that until World War II, the United
States refused to have a defense industry. It relied, instead, on
government-owned arsenals. To build a con- tractual partnership with
outside independent businesses would have run counter to the
constitutionalist tradition. Since the work had to be performed,
however, it had to be per- formed by government itself.</p>
<p>Models and Reality</p>
<p>Both dirigisme and constitutionalism are intellectual models of
political—or administra- tive—theory. They are norms of what ought to
be. And reality always falls far short of such an ideal.</p>
<p>This applies particularly to constitutionalism. Even in the United
States the doctrine of adversary, arm’s-length relationship between
business and government had, from the be- ginning, to contend with a
powerful American version of mercantilism. It began with Jef- ferson’s
great adversary, Alexander Hamilton (1757-1804). A generation later
Henry Clay (1777-1852) in his “American System” adapted mercantilism to
American conditions. The “enemy” was not outside. It was the trackless
wilderness beyond the frontier. Instead of exports, Clay advocated
“internal improvements,” that is, canals, railroads, farming, and
industries for the domestic market. And from the beginning the adversary
relationship to business went hand in hand with subsidies, especially to
canals and railways. And few countries have been as consistently
protectionist with respect to trade as the U.S.</p>
<p>Indeed, many critics, American and especially European, have called
the official U.S.</p>
<p>constitutionalist policy position mere hypocrisy and a complete sham.
But this misses the powerful impact constitutionalism has actually had
and still has. It largely informs Amer- ica’s traditional opposition to
the “system,” the Populist Crusade. It explains why the American radical
traditionally has opposed business as such whereas the European Leftist
has traditionally been “for” business and wants only to replace the
“wicked capitalist” with his own “good guys”—that is, government
administrators. (In this respect, the recent surge of a New Left in
Europe with a demand for “changing the system” actually repre- sents
ideological Americanization of a particularly ironic kind. It is no
accident that its main enemy is the traditional, that is, mercantilist
Left of the European tradition such as the old-line communists.)
Constitutionalism also explains the peculiar forms of U.S. eco- nomic
and business legislation and regulation. But there is considerable
substance to the old remark that, in her attitude to business and
economy, the U.S. has been Jeffersonian (i.e., constitutionalist) in
theory and Hamiltonian (i.e., mercantilist) in practice.</p>
<p>Mercantilism has been undoubtedly far more widely practiced. And when
the one country that had actually done what economic theory advocated
and had kept government out of the economy—that is, Great
Britain—shifted, in the late 1800s, to a political ap- proach to
business and economy, it shifted toward dirigisme (of the German rather
than the French model) rather than toward constitutionalism.</p>
<p>But even the mercantilist model was never fully realized in practice.
From the begin- ning there were tensions in it. Business again and again
slipped out of administrative con- trol. Even in Japan, government and
the business community see themselves as adversar- ies as much as
partners.</p>
<p>And constitutionalism made substantial inroads. The most influential
school of politi- cal economy on the continent of Europe in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centu- ries, that is, in the days when
the government-business alliance on the continent was at its peak, were
the German academic socialists (Katheder-Socialisten). These powerful
and influential professors wanted to separate business and government
and to replace the mer- cantilist alliance with something much closer to
the constitutionalist model. After World War II the Germans actually
committed themselves to constitutionalism. The “social mar- ket
economy,” which both major German parties adopted in the Adenauer years,
was not laissez-faire, it was constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Yet these two models have, for well over a century, been the guides
and set the norms.</p>
<p>They told governments and politicians what should be. They
established the criteria for right and wrong in the public mind. They
did not perhaps determine the business- government relationship, but
they set the limits within which speciflc relationship prob- lems could
be worked out on a case-by-case, issue-by-issue, “scandal-by-scandal”
basis.</p>
<p>The New Problems</p>
<p>By now, however, both models are obsolescent. Neither model offers
much guidance anymore, either to government or to business. Neither
model can cope with the new rela- tionship problems which, however,
demand solutions. The most important—or at least the most visible—of
these new problems have been caused by:</p>
<p>1 the “mixed economy”;</p>
<p>2 the multinational corporation;</p>
<p>3 government’s loss of its position as the institution; and</p>
<p>4 the emergence of the professional manager.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first of these realities is today’s “mixed economy.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of the models were developed for a capitalist economy. Both
could also function in a socialist economy (for the adaptation of
constitutionalism to socialist competition see Chapter 14). But neither
model can handle a mixed economy in which government activi- ties and
business activities intertwine and compete at the same time.</p>
<p>Every developed economy is a complex mixture of regulations,
governmental controls subsidies and penalties, business autonomy in
areas formerly considered government (e.g., autonomous postal services),
and direct government operations of business. There are institutions
that, while incorporated as private companies, are publicly owned and
discharge public functions. There are also institutions which while
government owned operate in fairly, competitive markets and discharge
“private-sector” functions. And there is a welter of the most complex
partnerships. Defense procurement is but one example; for in every
noncommunist country today defense procurement is done in a contractual
relationship, half partnership, half duel, between government and
autonomously managed and largely privately owned contractors.</p>
<p>Defense procurement may be considered a special case in the U.S., for
instance, the mixed economy in defense is still being explained away as
a “temporary emergency” al- most thirty years after the end of World War
II, which first created it. Everyone con- cerned knows that there is
nothing temporary about it and that the fiction of “temporary emergency”
is a major cause of the serious problems in defense procurement. Yet
every- one concerned also knows that any attempt to think through and
restructure the relation- ship would immediately run head on into
philosophical contradictions, fundamental po- litical convictions and
traditions, and irreconcilable differences between “what ought to be”
and what is needed. As one high Defense Department official once put it,
“We know it’s chaos; but that’s still better than paralysis.”</p>
<p>But even in areas other than defense, what is “public” and what is
“private,” what is “government” and what is “business” can no longer be
separated.</p>
<p>NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which put a
man on the moon in the 1960s, is an even “fuzzier” area than defense
procurement. (On NASA and its structure see Chapter 47.) NASA is a
government agency. And yet the American space effort was a cooperative
enterprise in which a large number of independent and autono- mous
organizations—government agencies, universities, individuals and, above
all, busi- ness—worked together on a common task. The legal structure
for this was a contractual relationship. The actual work was done in a
partnership in which at many times private businesses took the
leadership, made public policy, and set goals and standards. “In de-
fense procurement,” a NASA executive explained, “it’s always the
government that has an inspector in the contractor’s plant to control
his work. In NASA it is not at all uncommon for a contractor who is a
private business to have an inspector in a government installation who
controls the work the government is doing.”</p>
<p>There are going to be more and more joint tasks in which government
and business will have to be in a team, with leadership taken by one or
the other as the situation de- mands. There are the tasks of the
environment. There is the enormous task of husbanding</p>
<p>the resources of the world. There are the problems of the big city.
There is research— technological as well as social—and many others.
Quality-of-life tasks are perhaps by definition joint tasks in which
non-governmental institutions have to take social responsi- bility for
doing while governments may have to provide the money.</p>
<p>This is difficult enough to fit in with dirigisme. The civil servant
no longer guides and shapes a separate business community. In some
relationships he will have to be a partner, and not necessarily the
senior partner. In some relationships, e.g., in many areas of bank- ing
and insurance, he has to become the spokesman for business—some of it
private, some, especially in Europe, government-owned—against public
policy. In others, espe- cially in relations with “multinationals,”
private businesses represent the “public policy” of their own
government, for instance in European unification or in developing
underde- veloped economies while the civil servant defends “private
interests” of domestic indus- try. But, dirigisme can still accept
this—though the strain is great.</p>
<p>But the mixed economy is quite incompatible with the
constitutionalist model, which explains the extreme difficulty American
political parties, American political rhetoric, and American political
commentators have in explaining the way government and economy actually
work.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The second factor which cannot be made to jibe with the traditional
models is the multinational corporation. As will be explained later (in
Chapter 59) the multinational corporation is a response to the
divorce—or at least estrangement—of economy and sov- ereignty after
three hundred years of marriage. The economy can no longer be defined as
a national economy even in the biggest and most powerful countries such
as the United States. Yet sovereignty is still exclusively national.
There is no sign of anything to take the place of the nation-state as
the political sovereign. Yet there is a genuine world econ- omy which
carries the economic dynamics and actually determines economic-
developments worldwide, with direct impact on economic behavior,
activity, and results within the national economies, and yet is largely
impervious to political sovereignty.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mercantilist model is most directly challenged by the development
of which the multinational corporation is both carrier and effect. To
mercantilism this divorce is un- thinkable; yet it is happening. This
was clearly understood by General De Gaulle. His decision not to permit
French businesses to go multinational was completely rational. It was
also completely futile.</p>
<p>The constitutionalist model, too, can hardly cope with the
multinational corporation.</p>
<p>It is no accident that latter-day U.S. populism is attacking the
multinational corpora- tion. For the mercantilist tradition the crime of
the multinational corporation is that it is not an instrument of
political sovereignty and cannot be one. For the populist of the
American constitutionalist tradition the crime of the multinational
corporation is that it is not an instrument of American morality and
cannot be one. On the contrary, it must fit itself in every country to
the prevailing legal and moral beliefs of the political sovereignty in
the country where it operates.</p>
<p>And neither model could cope with the logical corollary to an
autonomous world economy, separate from, and outside of the political
sovereignty of any and all nation- states: a supranational currency and
credit mechanism with its own autonomous non- national “central bank.”
Yet this is clearly the direction ahead; indeed, the acceptance of
International Drawing Rights (IDR) issued by the International Monetary
Fund, as a “su- per-currency” in the Smithsonian Agreement in December
1971, was a decisive step. If development continues along this line,
neither the mercantilist nor the constitutionalist model could be
maintained, even as intellectual abstractions.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>In the society of organizations government becomes one
special-purpose institution rather than the institution. Such a society
creates social responsibility for the non- government leadership groups,
and especially for the business manager. It thereby under- mines the
uniqueness of government’s position and role. The other institutions can
no longer be seen, as they were in the mercantilist model, as
“handmaidens” of the Grand Design of national policy.</li>
</ol>
<p>What made De Gaulle so impressive a figure was his refusal to accept
this. De Gaulle instead insisted on the unchallenged primacy of La
Grande Politique—not only over the economy but equally over arts and
education. This made De Gaulle consistent and clear. But it also made
his policy appear old-fashioned and in the end almost absurd, even to
fervent admirers of a great man.</p>
<p>But the constitutionalist too has difficulty with a society in which
business is expected to assume social responsibility. His position all
along; and the basis for his insistence on an adversary relationship to
business, has been that business has to be restrained, policed,
regulated, limited—and if need be, punished—lest it behave irresponsibly
and antiso- cially. Hence the ambivalence approaching schizophrenia, of
the traditional American liberal who demands in the same breath that GM
or IBM be split up and that they mobi- lize their resources to solve
major social problems.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Finally, there is the emergence of the professional manager as
against the owner- entrepreneur. The traditional model speak of the
businessman. But the reality of today is the manager. This means that
the managers of business have emerged as a group which in origin,
education, background, and values closely resembles the civil servant.
(The one exception to this—changing fast though—is still Great Britain.)
At the same time the civil servant (as well as the leadership groups in
other institutions) are in the process of becom- ing managers.</li>
</ol>
<p>This development creates a danger of making business bureaucratic.
But it also abol- ishes the old demarcation lines. It thereby undermines
the distinction on which both the mercantilist model and the
constitutionalist model have been built.</p>
<p>The emergence of the manager as a leading group is particularly
incompatible with the mercantilist model. But equally incompatible for
the constitutionalist tradition is the growing trend forward considering
business management as the model for public admini- stration.</p>
<p>It may be argued that these are problems for government rather than
for business. But too much is at stake for business and management to
disregard the fact that the traditional, inherited relationship models
cannot adequately organize and structure relationship reali-</p>
<p>ties any more.</p>
<p>Solutions, as said before, are not within sight.</p>
<p>The orthodox Marxist would dispute that. But the reality in communist
countries is fully as much one of patchwork, increasing strain,
ineffectual compromise, and malper- formance. The struggle in the
communist countries between the “conservatives,” who want to maintain
complete dirigisme, and the “realists” or “liberals,” who argue for
“autonomy” of enterprise and markets, as the result of the growing gap
between the dirig- iste model and reality. And the Russian fear of any
deviation from the model, whether in Yugoslavia, in Czechoslovakia, or
in China, is a fear of political rather than of economic
consequences.</p>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>Specific problems will have to be dealt with even though there are no
known solutions, no new political theory, no new and more adequate
model. What is needed are “specifica- tions.” What is needed are
criteria by which specific answers to specific problems—ad hoc,
pragmatic, temporary—can be tested and judged. What is needed—and is
attain- able—are guidelines that strengthen, or at least protect, in the
ad hoc treatment of specific problems fundamental long-range needs and
requirements of the body-politic, of govern- ment, and of economy and
business enterprise.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first such specification is that the economic organizations of
society, i.e., busi- ness and their managers, require autonomy and
accountability:</li>
</ol>
<p>• in the interest of the economy;</p>
<p>• for the sake of strong and effective government; and</p>
<p>• in the interest of society.</p>
<p>“Accountable Enterprise” might be a better slogan than the by now
hackneyed “Free Enterprise.”*</p>
<p>To be accountable for performance, economic institutions and their
managers have to have autonomy. One cannot be accountable for what one
has no authority over and cannot control. Business enterprises and
managements have to be under the performance test or they cease to
perform. They have to be able to allocate society’s and economy’s
resources in a rational manner and against objective criteria. Or
resources will at once be misallo- cated.†</p>
<p>This is not a matter of ownership. It requires market test and market
decision, in the three economic dimensions—the market for goods and
services, the market for capital and investment, and the market for jobs
and careers.</p>
<p>Of the three, the capital market may be most crucial. It is in the
capital market that re- sources for the future are allocated on the
basis of performance expectation. And it is the capital market which,
therefore, while in need of regulation, also needs self-
determination.</p>
<p>But there is need also for an open-ended economy, an economy in which
businesses can be born, but one in which businesses can also die. It is
a basic weakness of a state- owned or state-controlled economic system
that businesses are not allowed to go bankrupt and can only rarely be
liquidated. Yet clearly the welfare of society and economy de- mands a
healthy business metabolism.</p>
<p>This will be particularly true in the decades ahead. They are going
to be decades of change. Unless businesses, even big and apparently
important businesses, are allowed to go out of existence, the
body-economic will increasingly age, become sclerotic, ossify. This will
not prevent change. It will rather make change into a catastrophic
threat instead o£ a gradual adjustment.</p>
<p>There is need for a cushioning of the social impact of such changes.
How this might be done has been discussed earlier (in Chapter 21 in
connection with Sweden’s Rehn Plan.) But the strength of the Rehn Plan
is precisely that it converts what otherwise might be individual
catastrophe into an “insurable risk” through full use of the market
mecha- nism.</p>
<p>The performance capacity of government also rests on autonomy for
business and management. A political process at best makes allocation
decisions poorly and painfully. They clog government and overload it to
the point where it cannot move at all, cannot make decisions, cannot
devote itself to the governmental tasks properly.‡</p>
<p>Society too requires management autonomy. Managers of the major
organizations are collectively the leadership groups of the society of
organizations. But a healthy society requires a pluralism of leadership
groups with different values, different priorities, differ- ent
“styles.” It requires alternatives—in careers and career ladders, in
points of view, in life-styles. Otherwise it degenerates into
conformity, and loses its capacity for change. If the need for change
arises—and it always does—no one can even imagine a behavior different
from what everyone in the leadership group is accustomed to and
considers “right” if not immutable “law of nature.” At the same time,
those among the able and am- bitious who do not fit easily into the one
norm of the one leadership group are alienated.</p>
<p>A healthy society is a complex of “countercultures.” They need not be
in conflict— indeed, in a healthy society they mutually respect each
other. But they must exist in com-</p>
<p>*If only because the word “free” has a different connotation in most
other languages and is read as implying license rather than
responsibility.</p>
<p>†On this, Ota Sik, the Czech communist theoretician and architect of
the economic liberalization of Czechoslo- vakia in 1967 and 1968—now
living in exile in Basel, Switzerland—has some profound things to say in
his little book, Czechoslovakia: The Bureaucratic Economy (International
Arts and Sciences Press, 1972). The book, containing lectures he gave to
his compatriots in the critical week before the Russian invasion, is a
graphic description of the self-destruction of a once highly productive
economy resulting from the loss of busi- ness and managerial
autonomy.</p>
<p>‡On this too, Sik (op. cit.) is most instructive.</p>
<p>petitive coexistence. In a society in which the cultures and
life-styles are increasingly those of the key organizations, social
health requires autonomy for major leadership groups. It requires
autonomous business with autonomous managements.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>But society also needs a healthy and functioning government,
especially in a com- plex and interdependent a society as ours has
become.</li>
</ol>
<p>Government is needed as the political decision-maker, more than ever
before perhaps.</p>
<p>And at the same time, the capacity of government to be the political
decision maker is increasingly jeopardized by its weight, size, and
bureaucratization. It is increasingly jeop- ardized by government
tendency to take on too many things, to promise too much, and to “do”
too much. The fatter government becomes, the flabbier and weaker it
actually is.*</p>
<p>Business and business management cannot restore government to health.
This is a po- litical job. But they can at least be conscious of the
need and avoid, in working out the business-government relationship,
whatever might weaken the performance capacity of government as the
central political decision-maker. In this area their responsibility is
“Primum non nocere”—”not knowingly to do damage.” (See the next
chapter.)</p>
<p>The Multinational Corporation</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The twin needs, for economic autonomy and effective government, come
together in one major problem of the business-government
relationship.</li>
</ol>
<p>The multinational corporation (again see Chapter 59) is a central
economic achieve- ment of the period since World War II and perhaps the
most fruitful social innovation of the century. It is also a hard
problem. What is needed is to work out a relationship which safeguards
both a true world economy and the political sovereignty of national
govern- ments in peaceful coexistence. Otherwise we will impair or
destroy altogether that most promising development, the multinational
business, and undermine the capacity for politi- cal vision and action
and for political community.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The need to think through the business-government relationship is
not, in the main, the result of a crisis of business. It is the result
of a serious crisis of government. Yet business managers will have to
look upon the relationship to government and society as their task. They
cannot wait for the political scientist or the theoretical economist. A
purely negative attitude which fights every “encroachment of government”
is not going to be effective. All it can do is delay. Positive,
affirmative action is needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>We do not need more laws. No country suffers from a shortage of laws
these days. We need a new model. Yet all we can expect are temporary ad
hoc answers to specific prob- lems. These answers should, however, be
compatible with minimum specifications: they should preserve the
autonomy and accountability of business enterprise and business
management; they should safeguard a free and flexible society capable of
change; they should harmonize the world economy of the multinational and
the sovereignty of the na- tion-states; and they should encourage strong
and performing government.</p>

who cheat, steal, lie, bribe, or take bribes. The problem is one of
moral values and moral education, of the individual, of the family, of
the school. But there neither is a separate ethics of business, nor is
one needed.</p>
<p>All that is needed is to mete out stiff punishments to those—whether
business execu- tives or others—who yield to temptation. In England a
magistrate still tends to hand down a harsher punishment in a
drunken-driving case if the accused has gone to one of the well- known
public schools or to Oxford or Cambridge. And the conviction still
.rates a head- line in the evening paper: “Eton graduate convicted of
drunken driving.” No one expects an Eton education to produce temperance
leaders. But it is still a badge of distinction, if not of privilege.
And not to treat a wearer of such a badge more harshly than an ordinary
workingman who has had one too many would offend the community’s sense
of justice. But no one considers this a problem of the “ethics of the
Eton graduate.” The other com- mon theme in the discussion of ethics in
business has nothing to do with ethics.</p>
<p>Such things as the employment of call girls to entertain customers
are not matters of ethics but matters of esthetics. “Do I want to see a
pimp when I look at myself in the mir- ror while shaving?” is the real
question.</p>
<p>It would indeed be nice to have fastidious leaders. Alas,
fastidiousness has never been prevalent among leadership groups, whether
kings and counts, priests or generals, or even “intellectuals” such as
the painters and humanists of the Renaissance, or the “literati” of the
Chinese tradition. All a fastidious man can do is withdraw personally
from activities that violate his self-respect and his sense of
taste.</p>
<p>Lately these old sermon topics have been joined, especially in the
U.S., by a third one: managers, we are being told, have an “ethical
responsibility” to take an active and con-</p>
<p>structive role in their community, to serve community causes, give of
their time to com- munity activities, and so on. There are many
countries where such community activity does not fit the traditional
mores; Japan and France would be examples. But where the community has a
tradition of “voluntarism”—that is, especially in the U.S.—managers
should indeed be encouraged to participate and to take responsible
leadership in commu- nity affairs and community organizations. Such
activities should, however, never be forced on them nor should they be
appraised, rewarded, or promoted according to their participation in
voluntary activities. Ordering or pressuring managers into such work is
abuse of organizational power and illegitimate.</p>
<p>An exception might be made for managers in businesses where the
community activi- ties are really part of their obligation to the
business. The local manager of the telephone company, for instance, who
takes part in community activities, does so as part of his managerial
duties and as the local public-relations representative of his company.
The same is true of the manager of a local Sears, Roebuck store. And the
local real estate man who belongs to a dozen different community
activities and eats lunch every day with a different “service club”
knows perfectly well that he is not serving the community but promoting
his business and hunting for prospective customers.</p>
<p>But, while desirable, community participation of managers has nothing
to do with eth- ics, and not much to do with responsibility. It is the
contribution of an individual in his capacity as a neighbor and citizen.
And it is something that lies outside his job and out- side his
managerial responsibility.</p>
<p>Leadership Groups but Not Leaders</p>
<p>A problem of ethics that is peculiar to the manager arises from the
fact that the managers of institutions are collectively the leadership
groups of the society of organizations. But individually a manager is
just another fellow employee.</p>
<p>This is clearly recognized by the public. Even the most powerful head
of the largest corporation is unknown to the public. Indeed most of the
company’s employees barely know his name and would not recognize his
face. He may owe his position entirely to personal merit and proven
performance. But he owes his authority and standing entirely to his
institution. Everybody knows GE, the Telephone Company, Mitsubishi,
Siemens, and Unilever. But who heads these great corporations—or for
that matter, the University of California, the École Polytechnique or
Guy’s Hospital in London—is of direct interest and concern primarily to
the management group within these institutions.</p>
<p>It is therefore inappropriate to speak of managers as leaders. They
are “members of the leadership group.” The group, however, does occupy a
position of visibility, of prominence, and of authority. It therefore
has responsibility—and it is with this responsi- bility that the
preceding chapters of this section are concerned.</p>
<p>But what are the responsibilities, what are the ethics of the
individual manager, as a member of the leadership group?</p>
<p>Essentially being a member of a leadership group is what
traditionally has been meant by the term “professional.” Membership in
such a group confers status, position, promi- nence, and authority. It
also confers duties. To expect every manager to be a leader is futile.
There are, in a developed society, thousands, if not millions, of
managers—and leadership is always the rare exception and confined to a
very few individuals. But as a member of a leadership group a manager
stands under the demands of professional eth- ics—the demands of an
ethic of responsibility.</p>
<p>Primum Non Nocere</p>
<p>The first responsibility of a professional was spelled out clearly,
2,500 years ago, in the Hipprocratic oath of the Greek physician: primum
non nocere—”Above all, not know- ingly, to do harm.”</p>
<p>No professional, be he doctor, lawyer, or manager, can promise that
he will indeed do good for his client. All he can do is try. But he can
promise that he will not knowingly do</p>
<p>harm. And the client, in turn, must be able to trust the professional
not knowingly to do him harm. Otherwise he cannot trust him at all. The
professional has to have autonomy. He cannot be controlled, supervised,
or directed by the client. He has to be private in that his knowledge
and his judgment have to be entrusted with the decision. But it is the
foun- dation of his autonomy, and indeed its rationale, that he see
himself as “affected with the public interest.” A professional, in other
words, is private in the sense that he is autono- mous and not subject
to political or ideological control. But he is public in the sense that
the welfare of his client sets limits to his deeds and words. And Primum
non nocere, “not knowingly to do harm,” is the basic rule of
professional ethics, the basic rule of an ethics of public
responsibility.</p>
<p>There are important areas where managers, and especially business
managers, still do not realize that in order to be permitted to remain
autonomous and private they have to impose on themselves the
responsibility of the professional ethic. They still have to learn that
it is their job to scrutinize their deeds, words, and behavior to make
sure that they do not knowingly do harm.</p>
<p>One, perhaps the most important one, of these areas has already been
discussed (in Chapter 25). The manager who fails to think through and
work for the appropriate solu- tion to an impact of his business because
it makes him “unpopular in the club” knowingly does harm. He knowingly
abets a cancerous growth. That this is stupid has been said. That this
always in the end hurts the business or the industry more than a little
temporary “unpleasantness” would have hurt has been said too. But it is
also gross violation of pro- fessional ethics.</p>
<p>But there are other areas as well. American managers, in particular,
tend to violate the rule not knowingly to do harm with respect to:</p>
<p>• executive compensation;</p>
<p>• the use of benefit plans to impose “golden fetters” on people in
the com- pany’s employ; and</p>
<p>• in their profit rhetoric.</p>
<p>Their actions and their words in these areas tend to cause social
disruption. They tend to conceal healthy reality and to create disease,
or at least social hypochondria. They tend to misdirect and to prevent
understanding. And this is grievous social harm.</p>
<p>Executive Compensation and Economic Inequality</p>
<p>Contrary to widespread belief, incomes have become far more equal in
all developed countries than in any society of which we have a record.
And they have tended to become steadily more equal as national and
personal incomes increase. And, equally contrary to popular rhetoric,
income equality is greatest in the United States.</p>
<p>The most reliable measure of income equality is the so-called Gini
co-efficient in which an index of zero stands for complete equality of
income and an index of 1 for total inequality in which one person in the
population receives all the income. The lower the Gini co-efficient, the
closer a society is to income equality. In the U.S. the Gini in the
early 1970s stood around 0.35—with about the same figure in Canada,
Australia, and Great Britain and probably also in Japan. West Germany
and the Netherlands are about 0.40. France and Sweden are around
0.50.*</p>
<p>Specifically, in the typical American business the inequality of
income between the lowest-paid people and the people in charge—that is,
between the machine operator and the manager of a large plant—is at most
one to four, if taxes are taken into account. The take-home pay of the
machine operator after taxes in 1970 was around ,500 a year; the
after-tax income of very few plant managers was larger than 5,000, all
bonuses in-</p>
<p>*On this see the article by Sanford Rose, “The Truth about Income and
Equality in the U.S.” in Fortune, De- cember, 1972.</p>
<p>cluded. If fringes are taken into account, the ratio is even lower,
i.e., one to three (or 2,000 to 5,000 maximum). And similar ratios
prevail in other developed countries, e.g., in Japan. This, it should be
said, is far greater income equality than in any communist country for
the simple reason that the economic level of a communist country is
lower.</p>
<p>In Soviet Russia, where there are practically no income taxes, the
income differential between industrial worker and plant manager runs
around 1 to 7, without taking into ac- count the non-cash benefits of
the Russian manager. And Russian managers operate at an extreme of
profit maximization; their profit-based bonus system of compensation so
di- rects them. In China, the differential between workers and plant
managers seems to run around 1 to 6 or so.</p>
<p>Whether the degree of inequality of incomes that actually prevails in
the U.S. econ- omy is “too high” or “too low” is a matter of opinion.
But clearly it is much lower than the great majority of the American
public accepts or even considers desirable. Every sur- vey shows that an
“income ratio of 1 to 10 or 12” between the blue-collar in the factory
and the “big boss” would be considered “about right.” That would make
the “after-tax take-home pay” of the “big boss” somewhere around 5,000
to 00,000 a year, which would be equal to a pre-tax salary of at least
00,000. And only a mere handful of ex- ecutives earn that much, bonuses
included. If the comparison is made—as it should be— between total
incomes including fringes, deferred compensation, stock options, and all
other forms of extra compensation, a 1 to 12 ratio would work out to an
after-tax top fig- ure of 50,000. And no more than a dozen or so top men
in the very largest companies have pre-tax “total compensation package”
of 00,000 and up, which is needed to pro- duce an after-tax value of
50,000. The “extremely rich” are not employed executives— the tax system
takes care of those (as it should); they are either a few heirs of the
million- aires of pre-tax days or owners of small businesses.</p>
<p>And relative to the incomes of manual and clerical workers, after-tax
executive com- pensation, and especially the income of the men at the
very top, has been going down steadily for fifty years or more.</p>
<p>The facts of increasing income equality in U.S. society are quite
clear. Yet the popular impression is one of rapidly increasing
inequality. This is illusion; but it is a dangerous illusion. It
corrodes. It destroys mutual trust between groups that have to live
together and work together. It can only lead to political measures
which, while doing no one any good, can seriously harm society, economy,
and the manager as well.</p>
<p>In some considerable measure, the belief in growing income inequality
in the U.S. re- flects, of course, America’s racial problem. The
emergence into visibility, that is, into the big cities, of a
disenfranchised nonworking population of Blacks has created a marginal
but highly visible group suffering from extreme inequality of incomes.
That the income of the employed Negro has been going up rapidly and is
likely, within a decade or so, to be equal to that of the employed white
doing the same kind of work—and that four-fifths of the American Negroes
are employed and working—tends to be obscured by the dire pov- erty of
the much smaller but highly concentrated groups of unemployed or
unemployables in the Black ghettos of the core cities.</p>
<p>Another reason for the widespread belief in growing inequality is
inflation. Inflation is a corrosive social poison precisely because it
makes people look for a villain. The economists’ explanation that no one
benefits by inflation, that is, that no one gets the pur- chasing power
that inflation takes away from the income recipients, simply makes no
sense to ordinary experience. Somebody must have benefited, somebody
“must have sto- len what is rightfully mine.” Every inflation in history
has therefore created class hatred, mutual distrust, and beliefs that,
somehow, “the other fellow” gains illicitly at “my” ex- pense. It is
always the middle class which becomes paranoid in an inflationary period
and turns against the “system.” The inflations of the sixties in the
developed countries were no exceptions.</p>
<p>But the main cause of the dangerous delusion on increasing inequality
of income is the widely publicized enormous pre-tax incomes of a few men
at the top of a few giant corpo-</p>
<p>rations, and the equally widely publicized “extras” of executive
compensation, e.g., stock options.</p>
<p>The 00,000 a year which the chief executive of one of the giant
corporations is be- ing paid is largely “make-believe money.” Its
function is status rather than income. Most of it, whatever tax
loopholes the lawyers might find, is immediately taxed away. And the
“extras” are simply attempts to put a part of the executive’s income
into a somewhat lower tax bracket. Economically, in other words, neither
serves much purpose. But so- cially and psychologically they “knowingly
do harm.” They cannot be defended.</p>
<p>One way to eliminate the offense is for companies to commit
themselves to a maxi- mum range of after-tax compensation. The 1 to 10
ratio that the great majority of Ameri- cans would consider perfectly
acceptable, would, in fact, be wider than the actual range of most
companies. (There should, I would argue, be room, however, for an
occasional ex- ception: the rare, “once-in-a-lifetime,” very big,
“special bonus” to someone, a research scientist, a manager, or a
salesman, who has made an extraordinary contribution.)</p>
<p>But equally important is acceptance of social responsibility on the
part of managers to work for a rational system of taxation,* which
eliminates the temptation of “tax gim- micks” and the need for them.</p>
<p>There is a strong case for adequate incentives for performing
executives. And com- pensation in money is far preferable to hidden
compensation such as perquisites. If he gets money the recipient can
choose what to spend it on—rather than, as in the case of “perks,”
taking whatever the company provides, be it a chauffeur-driven car, a
big house, or (as in the case of some Swedish companies) a governess for
the children. Indeed it may well be that real incomes in American
business are not sufficiently unequal and that the compression of income
differentials in the years since 1950 has been socially and eco-
nomically detrimental.</p>
<p>What is pernicious, however, is the delusion of inequality. The basic
cause is the tax laws. But the managers’ willingness to accept, and
indeed to play along with, an antisocial tax structure is a major
contributory cause. And unless managers realize that this violates the
rule “not knowingly to do damage,” they will, in the end, be the main
sufferers.</p>
<p>The Danger of “Golden Fetters”</p>
<p>A second area in which the manager of today does not live up to the
commitment of Pri- mum non nocere is closely connected with
compensation.</p>
<p>Since World War II compensation and benefits have been increasingly
misused to create “golden fetters.”</p>
<p>Retirement benefits, extra compensation, bonuses, and stock options
are all forms of compensation. From the point of view of the
enterprise—but also from the point of view of the economy—these are
“labor costs” no matter how they are labeled. They are treated as such
by managements when they sit down to negotiate with the labor union. But
in- creasingly, if only because of the bias of the tax laws, these
benefits are being used to tie an employee to his employer. They are
being made dependent on staying with the same employer, often for many
years. And they are structured in such a way that leaving a company’s
employ entails drastic penalties and actual loss of benefits that have
already been earned and that, in effect, constitute wages relating to
past employment.</p>
<p>This may be proper in a society which, like that of Japan, is built
on lifetime employ- ment and excludes mobility. Even in Japan, however,
“golden fetters” are no longer ac- ceptable to professional and
technical employees who increasingly should have mobility in their own
interest, in that of the Japanese economy, and even in that of the
Japanese company. In the West, and especially in the United States, such
golden fetters are clearly antisocial.</p>
<p>*We know the specifications of such a system—and they are simple: no
preferential tax rates for any personal income, whether from salaries or
from capital gains, and a limit on the maximum tax—say 50 percent of
local income received.</p>
<p>Golden fetters do not strengthen the company. They lead to “negative
selection.” Peo- ple who know that they are not performing in their
present employment—that is, people who are clearly in the wrong
place—will often not move but stay where they know they do not properly
belong. But if they stay because the penalty for leaving is too great,
they resist and resent it. They know that they have been bribed and were
too weak to say no. They are likely to be sullen, resentful, and bitter
the rest of their working lives.</p>
<p>The fact that the employees themselves eagerly seek these benefits is
no excuse. After all, medieval serfdom also began as an eagerly sought
“employee benefit.”*</p>
<p>It is incumbent, therefore, on the managers to think through which of
these benefits should properly—by their own rationale—be tied to
continued employment. Stock op- tions might, for instance, belong here.
But pension rights, performance bonuses, participa- tion in profits, and
so on, have been “earned” and should be available to the employee
without restricting his rights as a citizen, an individual, and a
person. And, again, manag- ers will have to work to get the tax law
changes that are needed.</p>
<p>The Rhetoric of the Profit Motive</p>
<p>Managers, finally, through their rhetoric, make it impossible for the
public to understand economic reality. This violates the requirement
that managers, being leaders, not know- ingly do harm. This is
particularly true of the United States but also of Western Europe. For
in the West, managers still talk constantly of the profit motive. And
they still define the goal of their business as profit maximization.
They do not stress the objective function of profit. They do not talk of
risks—or very rarely. They do not stress the need for capital. They
almost never even mention the cost of capital, let alone that a business
has to pro- duce enough profit to obtain the capital it needs at minimum
cost.</p>
<p>Managers constantly, complain about the hostility to profit. They
rarely realize that their own rhetoric is one of the main reasons for
this hostility. For indeed in the terms management uses when it talks to
the public, there is no possible justification for profit, no
explanation for its existence, no function it performs. There is only
the profit motive, that is, the desire of some anonymous capitalists—and
why that desire should be indulged in by society any more than bigamy,
for instance, is never explained. But profitability is a crucial need of
economy and society.</p>
<p>Managerial practice in most large American companies is perfectly
rational. It is the rhetoric which obscures, and thereby threatens to
damage both business and society. To be sure, few American companies
work out profitability as a minimum requirement. As a result, most
probably underestimate the profitability the company truly requires (let
alone as said in Chapter 9, the inflationary erosion of capital). But
they, consciously or not, base their profit planning on the twin
objectives of ensuring access to capital needed and minimizing the cost
of capital. In the American context, if only because of the structure of
the U.S. capital market, a high “price/earnings ratio” is indeed a key
to the minimization of the cost of capital; and “optimization of
profits” is therefore a perfectly rational strat- egy which tends to
lower, in the long run, the actual cost of capital.</p>
<p>But this makes it even less justifiable to keep on using the rhetoric
of the profit mo- tive. It serves no purpose except to confuse and to
embitter.</p>
<p>These examples of areas in which managers do not hold themselves to
the rule “not knowingly to do harm” are primarily American examples.
They apply to some extent to Western Europe. But they hardly apply to
Japan. The principle, however, applies in all countries, and in the
developing countries as much as in developed ones. These cases are taken
from business management. The principle, however, applies to managers of
all in- stitutions in the society of organizations.</p>
<p>In any pluralist society responsibility for the public good has been
the central problem and issue. The pluralist society of organizations
will be no exception. Its leaders represent “special interests,” that
is, institutions designed to fulfill a specific and partial need of</p>
<p>*On the “golden fetters” see also Chapter 11 of my book, The Age of
Discontinuity.</p>
<p>society. Indeed the leaders of this pluralist society of
organizations are the servants of such institutions. At the same time,
they are the major leadership group such a society knows or is likely to
produce. They have to serve both their own institution and the com- mon
good. If the society is to function, let alone if it is to remain a free
society, the men we call managers will remain “private” in their
institutions. No matter who owns them and how, they will maintain
autonomy. But they will also have to be “public” in their ethics.</p>
<p>In this tension between the private functioning of the manager: the
necessary auton- omy of his institution and its accountability, to its
own mission and purpose, and the pub- lic character of the manager, lies
the specific ethical problem of the society of organiza- tions. Primum
non nocere may seem tame compared to the rousing calls for “statesman-
ship” that abound in today’s manifestos on social responsibility. But,
as the physicians found out long ago, it is not an easy rule to live up
to. Its very modesty and self-constraint make it the right rule for the
ethics managers need, the ethics of responsibility.</p>

<p>Managers, the Basic Resource of a Business, the Scarcest, Most
Expensive, and Most Perishable—The Ford Story: A Controlled Experiment
in Mismanagement—Siemens and Mitsubishi as Examples—Ford and Lenin—The
Lesson of the Ford Story— Management Precedes Ownership—The “Management
Lag” of British Industry— Management “Change of Phase” Rather Than
Adaptation—Management, an Autonomous Function, Not a Delegated One</p>
<p>M</p>
<p>ANAGERS ARE THE BASIC RESOURCE of the business enterprise. In a fully
automatic factory there may be almost no rank-and-file employees at all.
But there will be managers—in fact, there will be many more than there
used to be in the factory of yesterday.</p>
<p>Managers are the most expensive resource in most businesses—and the
one that de- preciates the fastest and needs the most constant
replenishment. It takes years to build a management team; but it can be
depleted in a short period of misrule. The number of managers as well as
the capital investment each manager represents are bound to increase
steadily—as they have increased in the past half century. Parallel with
this will go an in- crease in the demands of the enterprise on the
ability of its managers. These demands have doubled in every generation;
there is no reason to expect a slowing down of the trend during the next
decades.</p>
<p>How well managers manage and are managed determines whether business
goals will be reached. It also largely determines how well the
enterprise manages worker and work. For the worker’s attitude reflects,
above all, the attitude of his management. It directly mirrors
management’s competence and structure. The worker’s effectiveness is
deter- mined largely by the way he is being managed.</p>
<p>During the last quarter century managers everywhere have subjected
themselves to a steady barrage of exhortations, speeches, and programs
in which they tell each other that their job is to manage the people
under them, urge each other to give top priority to that responsibility,
and furnish each other with copious advice and expensive gadgets for
“downward communications.” But I have yet to sit down with a manager,
whatever his level or job, who was not primarily concerned with his
upward relations and upward communications.* Every vice-president feels
that relations with the president are the real problem. And so on down
to the first-line supervisor, the production foreman, or chief clerk,
who is quite certain that he could get along with his men if only the
“boss” and the personnel department left him alone.</p>
<p>This is not, as personnel people seem inclined to think, a sign of
the perversity of hu- man nature. Upward relations are properly a
manager’s first concern. To be a manager means sharing in the
responsibility for the performance of the enterprise. A man who is not
expected to take this responsibility is not a manager.</p>
<p>*This will be treated further in Chapter 38, “Managerial
Communications.”</p>
<p>These problems of upward relations that worry the manager—the
relationship to his own boss; his doubts as to what is expected of him;
his difficulty in getting his point across, his program accepted, his
activity given full weight; the relations with other de- partments and
with staff people, and so forth—are all problems of managing
managers.</p>
<p>The Rise, Decline and Rebirth of Ford</p>
<p>The story of Henry Ford, his rise and decline, and of the revival of
his company under his grandson, Henry Ford II, has been told so many
times that it has passed into folklore. Everybody has heard</p>
<p>• that Henry Ford, starting with nothing in 1905, had built fifteen
years later the world’s largest and most profitable manufacturing
enterprise;</p>
<p>• that the Ford Motor Company, in the early twenties, dominated and
almost</p>
<p>monopolized the American automobile market and held a leadership
position in most of the other important automobile markets of the
world;</p>
<p>• that, in addition, it had amassed, out of profits, cash reserves of
a billion dol- lars or so;</p>
<p>• that, only a few years later, by 1927, this seemingly impregnable
business</p>
<p>empire was in shambles. Having lost its leadership position and
barely able to stay a poor third in the market, it lost money almost
every year for twenty years or so, and remained unable to compete
vigorously right through World War II; and</p>
<p>• that in 1944 the founder’s grandson, Henry Ford II, then only
twenty-six years old and without training or experience, took over,
ousted two years later his grandfather’s cronies in a palace coup,
brought in a totally new man- agement team and saved the company.</p>
<p>But it is not commonly realized that this dramatic story is far more
than a story of per- sonal success and failure. It is, above all, what
one might call a controlled experiment in mismanagement.</p>
<p>The first Ford failed because of his firm conviction that a business
did not need man- agers and management. All it needed, he believed, was
the owner-entrepreneur with his “helpers.” The only difference between
Ford and most of his contemporaries in business, in the U.S. as well as
abroad, was that, as in everything he did,* Henry Ford stuck uncom-
promisingly to his convictions. The way he applied them—e.g., by firing
or sidelining any one of his “helpers,” no matter how able, who dared
act as a “manager,” make a decision, or take action without orders from
Ford—can only be described as a test of a hypothesis that ended up by
fully disproving it.</p>
<p>In fact, what makes the Ford story unique—but also important—is that
Ford could test the hypothesis, in part because he lived so long, and in
part because he had a billion dol- lars to back his convictions. Ford’s
failure was not the result of personality or tempera- ment but first and
foremost a result of his refusal to accept managers and management as
necessary and as grounded in task and function rather than in
“delegation” from the “boss.”</p>
<p>But Ford was by no means alone in his belief that managers are
unnecessary. This is shown by the experience of two other major growth
businesses of the period before World War I: Siemens in Germany and
Mitsubishi in Japan.</p>
<p>Werner von Siemens (1816-1892) was as different a personality from
Henry Ford as can be imagined. One of the nineteenth century’s greatest
inventors, he was a man of ut- most concern and consideration for
people, whether workers or fellow scientists. To this day the company he
founded is characterized by a rare sense of mutual loyalty and of
re-</p>
<p>*On Henry Ford, see my essay “Henry Ford” in my book, Men, Ideas and
Politics (Harper andandandand Row, 1971); English edition is called The
New Markets (Heinemenn, 1971).</p>
<p>sponsibility for people. But Siemens did not have “managers.” He had
“helpers” and “as- sistants.” Growing spectacularly until the late
1870s, the company began to slow down, gradually slipped out of control,
and became “unmanageable” and practically unmanaged. The English Siemens
company, originally the most prosperous business of the Siemens group,
was destroyed by mismanagement and had to be abandoned. When competition
appeared in the late eighties—especially from the German General
Electric Company (AEG) founded by Emil Rathenau in close cooperation
with the American General Elec- tric Company—Siemens, despite its long
lead, rapidly lost ground in the very markets it had formerly dominated.
Unlike Ford though, Siemens did not have practically unlimited financial
resources. When, in 1897, five years after the founder’s death, the
company had to take recourse to the capital market, a banker—Georg
Siemens, a cousin of Werner and</p>
<p>by that time head of the Deutsche Bank (see Chapter 49)—used the need
for money to force the founder’s reluctant sons and heirs to accept a
management structure and manag- ers.</p>
<p>Descendants of the founder remained powerful in the company until
World War II and still sit on the company’s board today, but the
reorganization of 1897 created managerial jobs that were grounded in
task and function, and independent of the whims—and even the wishes—of
the family members. Within a few years the company, which had been
floundering, had regained its vigor; in the early years of the century,
when the German electrical industry went through a period of shake-outs
and consolidations, it was around Siemens that the new industry
structure was being built. The new, professional manage- ment, brought
in ten years earlier under Georg Siemens’s pressure, and largely from
within the company, worked out these mergers and integrated the newly
acquired compa- nies into the Siemens structure, thus ensuring for the
company another forty years of lead- ership in Europe’s electrical
industry.</p>
<p>Yataro Iwasaki (1834-1885), the founder of Mitsubishi, was also a
personality totally different from Henry Ford, and from Werner von
Siemens as well. He had, to the highest degree, the faculty of
attracting, developing, and using first-rate men. But, like the other
two men, he did not believe in managers. In a sharp and conscious break
with the Japa- nese tradition of the Ie—the “household community” in
which power goes by seniority rather than ownership and in which work is
done by teams*—Iwasaki insisted on the sole authority and responsibility
of the owner-entrepreneur. This, to him, was “progressive” and
“Western.” Like Ford he was forced to incorporate his company. Like Ford
he con- sidered this a mere formality—an irksome one, to boot—and
decreed that all ownership should forever be vested in one man: the head
of the family. This man, and this man alone, should make all the
decisions; the others should be his “assistants” and carry out his
orders. Iwasaki started in 1867—right after the Meiji Restoration—as a
penniless samurai (hereditary warrior). Fifteen years later his concern
was the leading industry in Japan, having outstripped the much older
business powers, Mitsui and Sumitomo, whose roots went back to the
seventeenth century. But by that time—comparable to Ford’s situa- tion
in 1920—Mitsubishi began to slow down, to drift, and to show clear signs
of incipi- ent decay. Fortunately for the company, Iwasaki died, barely
fifty years old, in 1885. His trusted associates, though sworn to uphold
the constitution he had laid down and to vest full authority in the head
of thc family, immediately restructured and built the strongest, most
truly professional and most autonomous management group in Japan, from
which the family, while treated with the greatest deference, was
completely excluded. And it was then that the rise and growth of
Mitsubishi truly began.</p>
<p>But it was not only the nineteenth-century business leader who
refused to accept man- agers and management. Lenin also did not accept
management; and his refusal underlies basic problems and difficulties of
communism.</p>
<p>It can be argued that Ford’s personal misrule, his estrangement from
reality and his in- creasing dependence on a secret police chief who
ruled through espionage and terror were</p>
<p>*On this see Chie Nakane, Japanese Society (University of California
Press, 1970), a “must” for anyone who wants to understand how Japanese
organizations work.</p>
<p>not so much traits of his personality as consequences of his
doctrine. Similarly, it may well be that Stalinism, with its terror,
purges, paranoid suspicions, and dependence on police informers and
toadies, reflects the inevitable—consequences of the belief that
managers and management are superfluous and that the “great man” can
govern big and complex organizations and structures with his assistants
and helpers—that is, his courti- ers.</p>
<p>GM—The Counter-test</p>
<p>In the early twenties, when Ford set out to prove that managers are
not needed, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., the newly appointed president of
General Motors, put the opposite thesis to the test. GM at that time was
almost crushed by the towering colossus of the Ford Motor Company and
barely able to survive as a weak number two. Little more than a
jerry-built financial speculation, stitched together out of small
automobile companies that had been for sale because they could not stand
up to Ford’s competition, GM did not have one win- ning car in its line,
no dealer organization, and no financial strength. Each of the former
owners was allowed autonomy, which in effect meant that he was allowed
to mismanage his former business his own way and as his own personal
fief. But Sloan thought through what the business and structure of GM
should be* and converted his undisciplined barons into a management
team. Within five years GM had become the leader in the American
automobile industry and has remained the leader ever since.</p>
<p>Then, twenty years later, Henry Ford’s grandson put Sloan’s
hypothesis to the test again. The Ford Motor Company by then was nearly
bankrupt; the entire billion dollars of cash assets it had held in the
early twenties had been poured into paying for the deficits since. As
soon as young Henry Ford II took over in 1946, he set out to do for his
com- pany what Sloan had done for GM two decades earlier. He created a
management struc- ture and a management team. Within five years the Ford
Motor Company regained its potential for growth and profit, both at home
and abroad. It became the main competitor to General Motors and even
outstripped GM in the fast-growing European automobile market.</p>
<p>The Lesson of the Ford Story</p>
<p>The lesson of the Ford story is that managers and management are the
specific need of the business enterprise, its specific organ, and its
basic structure. We can say dogmatically that enterprise cannot do
without managers. One cannot argue that management does the owner’s job
by delegation. Management is needed not only because the job is too big
for any one man to do himself, but because managing an enterprise is
something essentially different from managing one’s own property.</p>
<p>Henry Ford—and Siemens and Iwasaki—failed to see the need to change
to managers and management because they believed (as the textbooks still
tell us) that a large and complex business enterprise “evolves”
organically from the small one-man shop. Of course, Ford, Siemens, and
Iwasaki started small. But the growth brought more than a change in
size. At one point quantity turned into quality. At one point they no
longer ran “their own business” but moved over into a business
enterprise, that is, into an organiza- tion requiring different
structure and different principles—an organization requiring man- agers
and management.</p>
<p>Legally, management is still seen as delegation from ownership, even
in the Soviet system. But the actual doctrine that is slowly evolving is
that management precedes and indeed outranks ownership, at least in the
large enterprise. Even total ownership of such an enterprise is
dependent on proper management. If the owner does not subordinate him-
self to the enterprise’s need for management his ownership—while legally
unrestricted— will in fact be curtailed, if not taken away from him.</p>
<p>*On Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., see my book Managing for Results and
Sloan’s own book, My Years with General Motors (Doubleday, 1964).</p>
<p>This was, one assumes, in Georg Siemens’s mind when he confronted his
young cous- ins with the choice between accepting management or being
ousted from control. As legal doctrine—though a nascent rather than a
clearly formulated one—it probably was first laid down by the U.S. Air
Force in the early fifties in dealing with Howard Hughes and the Hughes
Aircraft Company. Hughes owned the company lock, stock, and barrel. He
refused to let professional managers run it and insisted on running it
himself the way Ford, thirty years earlier, had run the Ford Motor
Company. Thereupon the Air Force, the company’s main customer, gave
Hughes an ultimatum: either you put your shares into a trust and let
professional management take over, or we put the company into bankruptcy
and force you out altogether. Hughes retained ownership title through
one of his founda- tions but relinquished control entirely.</p>
<p>The next case also concerns Howard Hughes. As all but complete owner
of one of America’s major airlines, TWA, he, it is alleged, subordinated
TWA’s interests to those of other companies of his. For an owner this is
perfectly legitimate behavior; he is sup- posed to do with his property
as he pleases. But TWA management sued Hughes for 50 million in damages.
It lost the suit only in 1973 in the Supreme Court—having won it in two
lower courts—on a technicality; the Supreme Court ruled that this was a
matter for the Civil Aeronautics Board over which the ordinary courts
had no jurisdiction. But the principle that even the owner has to act as
a manager, at least in a large company, was not disputed.</p>
<p>The same principle also underlies the treatment of the Krupp family
when the German banks came to their company’s rescue in the late
sixties. The company was wholly owned by the family. But the banks
clearly felt that Krupp’s treatment of the company as prop- erty was
improper. Whereas Siemens, seventy years earlier, had still tried to
maintain family ownership, the German banks in the Krupp settlement
forced the family to divest themselves completely of both ownership and
control.</p>
<p>Genetically, so to speak, management did not evolve out of the small
owner-managed firm and as a result of its growth. It was designed ab
initio for enterprises that were large and complex to begin with.</p>
<p>The large American railroad which covered vast distances—and which
wrestled with the complex interplay between the engineering task of
building a railbed, the financial task of raising very large sums of
capital, and the political-relations tasks of obtaining charters, land
grants, and subsidies—was the first enterprise that can be called “man-
aged.” Indeed, the management structure designed shortly after the Civil
War for the first long-distance and transcontinental American railroads
has essentially remained un- changed to this day. In continental Europe,
at about the same time, management was de- signed for the first banks
founded expressly to be national rather than local banks.* And in
faraway Japan, the builders of the Zaibatsu of the Meiji Period—Mitsui,
Sumitomo, and Iwasaki’s successors at Mitsubishi—using traditional
Japanese approaches in a new man- ner, also fashioned a management
system for the large and complex enterprise.</p>
<p>It was not until thirty or forty years later that the concept of
management was trans- ferred from the enterprise that started out large
to the enterprise that had grown large. How George Siemens forced his
reluctant cousins at the Siemens Electrical Company to do so in 1897 by
using their need for capital as a lever has already been recounted. At
about the same time Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, Jr.,
introduced manage- ment into the steel and petroleum industries
respectively. A little later still Pierre S. du Pont restructured the
family company (E.I. du Pont de Nemours andandandand Co.) and gave it a
management, both to make it capable of growth and to preserve family
control.† The management structure Pierre du Pont built in his family
company between 1915 and 1920 became, a few years later, the starting
point for the General Motors structure of “profes-</p>
<p>*On this see the story of Georg Siemens and the Deutsche Bank, in
Chapter 49.</p>
<p>†On Pierre du Pont see Alfed D. Chandler, Jr., and Stephen Salisbury,

andandandand Row, 1971); also Alfred J. Chandler, Jr., Strategy and
Structure (M.I.T. Press, 1962).</p>
<p>sional management” after the Du Ponts had acquired control of the
near-bankrupt and floundering automotive conglomerate and had put Alfred
P. Sloan, Jr., in as president.</p>
<p>It cannot be proven, but there is a high probability that the decline
of Great Britain in the late nineteenth century from her position of
economic world leadership was not pri- marily caused by technological
lag but by management lag, that is, by the failure to re- structure what
had become large and complex enterprises on a genuine managerial foun-
dation.</p>
<p>Rather than restructure their companies the British compromised. The
“board” became neither a supervisory organ nor genuine management but a
mixture of the two. As a result the role, function, and authority of
managers was not clearly established. To see the dif- ference one need
only compare the account of the development of the British chemical
industry*—the world leader in 1870, the “also ran” twenty years
later—with Chandler’s account of the Du Ponts. As late as 1926, when
Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was formed by merging all large
British chemical companies into one, the first “board” was both the top
management organ and a mélange of wealthy amateurs representing former
founder-families—without clear structure within the board or below it.
The German I.G. Farben was formed in a similar fashion a few months
earlier. But from the beginning the Germans took financial, family, and
prestige problems out of the management structure and dumped them on a
non-managing board of supervisors. A few members of the found- ing
families were taken on the board of management. But they served as
professional managers, that is, had a specific job, function, and
authority, and were equals on a team dominated by professionals without
family or ownership background.</p>
<p>Management as a “Change of Phase”</p>
<p>The change from a business which the owner-entrepreneur can run with
“helpers” to a business that requires a management is what the
physicists call a “change of phase” such as the change from fluid to
solid. It is a leap from one state of matter, from one fundamen- tal
structure, to another. Sloan’s example shows that it can be made within
one and the same organization. But Sloan’s restructuring of GM also
shows that the job can be done only if basic concepts, basic principles,
and individual vision are changed radically.</p>
<p>One can compare the business which the older Ford tried to run and
the business which Sloan designed to two different kinds of
organisms—the insect, which is held to- gether by a tough, hard skin,
and the vertebrate animal, which has a skeleton. The English biologist
D’Arcy Thompson showed that animals supported by a hard skin can reach
only a certain size and complexity. Beyond this, a land animal has to
have a skeleton. Yet the skeleton has not genetically evolved out of the
hard skin of the insect; it is a different or- gan with different
antecedents. Similarly, management becomes necessary when a busi- ness
reaches a certain size and complexity. But management, while it replaces
the “hard- skin” structure of the owner-entrepreneur, is not its
successor. It is, rather, its replace- ment.</p>
<p>When does a business reach the stage at which it has to shift from
“hard skin” to “skeleton”? The line lies somewhere between 300 and 1,000
employees in size. More important, perhaps, is the increase in
complexity; when a variety of tasks have all to be performed in
cooperation, synchronization, and communication a business needs manag-
ers and a management. Otherwise, things go out of control; plans fail to
turn into action; or, worse, different parts of the plans get going at
different speeds, different times, and with different objectives and
goals, and the favor of the “boss” becomes more important than
performance. At this point the product may be excellent, the people able
and dedi- cated. The boss may be—indeed often is—a man of great ability
and personal power. But the business will begin to flounder, stagnate,
and soon go downhill unless it shifts to the “skeleton” of managers and
management structure.</p>
<p>*W.J. Reader, Imperial Chemical Indusuies: A History, vol. one
1874-1926 (Oxford University Press, 1970).</p>
<p>Henry Ford—like the young Siemenses, Iwasaki, and Lenin—wanted no
managers.</p>
<p>But the only result was that he misdirected managers, set up their
jobs improperly, created a spirit of suspicion and frustration,
misorganized his company and stunted or broke man- agement people. The
only choice management has in these areas is therefore whether it will
do the jobs well or badly. But the jobs themselves cannot be evaded. And
whether they are being done right or not will determine largely whether
the enterprise will survive and prosper or decline and ultimately
fall.</p>
<h4 id="what-makes-a-manager">30 What Makes a Manager?</h4>
<p>The Traditional Definition—Its Inadequacy—Manager and Member of
Manage- ment—The Career Professional—Defining a Manager by Function
Rather Than Power—Title, Function, and Pay of the Career
Professional</p>
<pre><code>HAT CHARACTERIZES A MANAGER? “manager” and “management” are slippery,</code></pre>
<p>And what defines him? The words to say the least. They are
untranslat-</p>
<p>able into any other language. In British English they do not have the
meaning they have in the United States. And even in American usage,
their meaning is far from clear.</p>
<p>The word “manager” has no exact counterpart in German, French,
Spanish, Italian, or Russian; yet the words used in these languages are
as imprecise and elusive as “manager” is in American. Most people, when
asked what they mean by “manager,” will reply “a boss.” But when the
sign over the shoeshine stand in an airport reads “John Smith, Man-
ager,” everybody (at least in America) knows that this means that
Mr. Smith is not the boss, i.e., not the proprietor, but a hired hand
with a minimum of authority and a salary just above that of the workers
who shine the shoes.</p>
<p>Early in the history of management a manager was defined as someone
who “is re- sponsible for the work of other people.” This served a
useful purpose at the time. It dis- tinguished the manager’s function
from that of the “owner.” It made clear that managing was a specific
kind of work which could be analyzed, studied, and improved systemati-
cally. The definition focused on the essentially new, large and
permanent organization emerging to perform the economic tasks of
society.</p>
<p>Yet, the definition is not at all satisfactory. In fact, it never
was. From the beginning, there were people in the enterprise, often in
responsible positions, who were clearly man- agement and yet did not
manage, that is, who were not responsible for the work of other people.
The treasurer of a company, the man responsible for the supply and use
of money in the business, may have subordinates and in that sense be a
manager in terms of the tra- ditional definition. But clearly, the
treasurer himself does most of the treasurer’s job. He works with the
company’s underwriters, with the financial community, and so on. He is
an “individual contributor,” rather than a manager. But he is a member
of top management.</p>
<p>Also, the definition focuses on the tools for a task rather than on
the task itself. The man in charge of market research in a company may
have a large number of people re- porting to him and is thus a manager
in the traditional sense. But it really makes no differ- ence to his
function and contribution whether he has a large staff, a small staff,
or no staff at all. The same contribution in terms of market research
and market analysis can well be made by a man to whom no one reports. He
may even make a greater contribution when he is not forced to spend a
great deal of his time with subordinates and on their work. He thus may
make market research more effective in the business, better understood
by his associates in management, and more firmly built into the
company’s basic business deci- sions and into its definition of what
“our business is and should be.”</p>
<p>In line with the traditional definition of a manager as a man who “is
responsible for the work of others” we should talk of a “manager of
market researchers.” Instead, we al- ways talk of a “manager of market
research.” This common usage is right in its intuitive understanding of
what the responsibility of the managerial position is and should be, and
how the incumbent should be measured.</p>
<p>The traditional definition has become increasingly inappropriate and
a bar to effective management, effective organization, and true
performance.</p>
<p>The most rapidly growing group in any organization, especially in
today’s business enterprise, are people who are management, in the sense
of being responsible for contri- bution to and results of the
enterprise.* However, they are clearly not managers in that they are
not, as a rule, the bosses and responsible for the work of other people.
The most rapidly growing group in business enterprise today are
individual professional contribu- tors of all kinds who work by
themselves (perhaps with an assistant and a secretary) and yet have
impact on the company’s wealth-producing capacity, the direction of its
busi- ness, and its performance.</p>
<p>Such people are not to be found only in technical research work,
though it was here that they first emerged as a distinct group. The
senior chemist in the laboratory has major responsibility and makes
major decisions, many of them irreversible in their impact. But so also
does the man who works out and thinks through the company’s organization
and designs managerial jobs, whether his title be organization planner
or director of manage- ment development. Here also belongs the senior
cost accountant who determines the defi- nition and allocation of costs.
By defining the measurements for management, he, in ef- fect, largely
decides whether a certain product will be kept or will be abandoned.
Other people in the same category are the man charged with the
development and maintenance of quality standards for a company’s
products, the man working on the distributive system through which the
company’s products are being brought to the market, and the advertis-
ing director, who may be responsible for the basic promotion policy of a
company, its advertising message, the media it uses, and the
measurements of advertising effectiveness.</p>
<p>The traditional definition is responsible, in large measure, for the
fact that the individ- ual professional contributor presents a problem
within the structure and a problem to him- self. His title, his pay, his
function, and his career opportunities are confused, ambiguous, and a
cause of dissatisfaction and friction. Yet the number of these career
professionals is increasing fast.</p>
<p>There needs to be greater flexibility in assigning people within the
management group—to task forces, teams, and other organizational units
which do not fit the tradi- tional concept of a “line organization,”
that is, an organization in which one member is the boss, while the
others are subordinates.†</p>
<p>Managers in the traditional sense will have to be able to move into
situations where they are not superiors, indeed, into situations where
they are the “juniors” to non- managers on a team or a task force.
Conversely, career professionals without managerial function or title in
the traditional sense will have to be able to be team leaders or task
force leaders. The traditional separation between managers and
non-managers will in- creasingly become a hindrance and
inappropriate.</p>
<p>The New Definition of a Manager</p>
<p>It is necessary and urgent, that we think through what really defines
a manager and who should be considered management.</p>
<p>The first attempt at solving the problem, made in the early 1950s,
supplemented the definition of the manager with a new definition of an
“individual professional contribu-</p>
<p>*On this see especially Chapter 35.</p>
<p>†On the team as organizational design see Chapter 45.</p>
<p>tor”* with “parallel paths of opportunity” for both. This made it
possible to pay a man properly for “professional” work rather than make
higher pay dependent upon promotion into a “manager’s” job, that is,
into a position of responsibility for the work of others.</p>
<p>Yet this formula has not fully solved the problem. The companies that
have adopted it report that the individual professional contributor is
only slightly less dissatisfied than he was before. He remains convinced
that true opportunities for advancement still exist only, or at least
primarily, within the administrative structure, and that one has to
become a “boss” to “get ahead.” Above all, the separation of the
managerial world into two groups serves to emphasize the inferiority of
those who do their own work as compared with those responsible for the
work of others. The emphasis is still on power and authority rather than
on responsibility and contribution.</p>
<p>Outside of the U.S. the problem may be even worse. In Japan there are
no career op- portunities at all for the individual contributor.
Seniority forces a Japanese to become an administrator—as a result of
which, for instance, the ablest newspapermen are forced to stop writing
and the ablest scientists in the research labs to become “research
managers” and to stop researching.</p>
<p>Any analysis which does not start out from the traditional definition
but looks at the work itself will come to the conclusion that the
traditional definition of a manager as one responsible for the work of
others emphasizes a secondary; rather than a primary, charac-
teristic.</p>
<p>As we will see (in the next chapter), one can define the work of a
manager as plan- ning, organizing, integrating, and measuring. The
career professional—e.g., a market re- searcher who works by himself, or
a senior cost accountant—also has to plan, to organize, and to measure
his results against his objectives and expectations. He also has to
integrate his work with the work of other people in the organization. He
has to integrate his work into that of the unit of which he is a part.
Above all, if he is to have results, he has to inte- grate “sideways,”
that is, with the people in other areas and functions who have to put
his work to use.</p>
<p>Similarly, the “manager” has to integrate “downwards,” that is, with
the work of the people who report to him—which is what the traditional
definition stresses. The most important relation areas in which he has
to integrate the work of his unit, if it is to have any results, cut
again sideways—that is, with people over whom he has no managerial
control.</p>
<p>The essence of the first-line supervisor’s job in the plant or office
is the management of the people who report to him. Upward or sideways
relations are secondary on that level. Yet common usage does not
consider the first-line supervisor a manager. We speak of the supervisor
as a “member of management,” implying that he should be a manager but
really is not, or only marginally so. The reason is, of course, that the
first-line supervi- sor, whether in the factory or in the office, is not
commonly expected to take much re- sponsibility for his contribution and
results. He is expected to deliver aceording to objec- tives set for him
by others—in the typical mass-production plant this is all he possibly
can or should do. This makes the supervisor’s job ambiguous and
difficult.† But the fact that we are reluctant to call the supervisor a
manager, even though his job fits the traditional definition better than
the jobs of people who hold higher and much more important posi- tions
in the executive hierarchy, only demonstrates that the definition
accentuates the sec- ondary, rather than the primary.</p>
<p>It would, therefore, seem appropriate to stress that the first
criterion in identifying those people within an organization who have
management responsibility is not command over people. It is
responsibility for contribution. Function rather than power has to be
the distinctive criterion and the organizing principle.</p>
<p>*The pioneer in this effort was the General Electric Company
especially its former vice-president— management services, Harold F.
Smiddy, who realized the central importance of this problem and made the
first attempts at solving it.</p>
<p>†See Chapter 21.</p>
<p>But what should these people be called? Many organizations have
experimented with new definitions or have tried to give old terms a new
meaning.* Perhaps the best thing is not to coin a new term, but to
follow popular usage which speaks of the “management group.” Within the
management group, there will be people whose function includes the
traditional managerial function, responsibility for the work of others.
There will be others who do not carry this responsibility within their
specific assignment. And there will be a third group which is somewhat
ambiguous and in-between, people whose job is that of team leader or
task force captain, or people who combine both the function of advisor
to top management and the “conscience” of a business in a certain area,
with supervisory and administrative responsibility over a staff in a
given area. This is not a neat, let alone a perfect, solution. In every
organization there are people who are true specialists and who, while
anything but rank-and-file workers, do not see themselves as past of
management either. They want to remain specialists and are not,
fundamentally, much concerned with the whole of which they are a part.
Their allegiance is to their technical or professional skill, rather
than to their organization. The psychologist within a personnel
department sees himself as a professional—that is, a member of the world
of his academic specialty— rather than as an executive of this or that
company (or even as a faculty member of this or that university). And so
does the computer specialist.</p>
<p>Conversely, in many traditions other than the American, there are
people who fully accept the responsibility for their contribution but
are not deemed managers, or part of management, even though they may be
responsible for the work of others. An example is the German Meister,
the highly skilled worker who has risen to leadership within his craft,
who is in most cases the true “boss” within his craft area, and who yet
considers himself a skilled worker rather than a manager. He
corresponds, in many ways, to the noncommis- sioned officer in the
military, the long-serving master sergeant, for instance, who within his
own area, e.g., supply, is the real “boss,” but who will never become an
officer and does not expect to be one.</p>
<p>Yet though fuzzy, to define the management group by function and
responsibility en- ables us to work out the relationship between the
manager and the career professional.</p>
<p>The Career Professional</p>
<p>The career professional—and particularly the specialist—needs a
manager. His major problem is the relation of his area of knowledge and
expertise to the performance and results of the entire organization. The
career professional therefore has a major problem of communication. He
cannot be effective unless his output becomes the input of other people.
But his output is ideas and information. This requires that the users of
his output understand what he is trying to say and to do. But, by the
nature of his task, he will be tempted to use his own specialized
jargon. Indeed, in many cases, this is the only lan- guage in which he
is fluent. It is the job of the manager to make the specialist realize
that he cannot become effective unless he is understood, and that he
cannot be understood unless he tries to find out the needs, the
assumptions, and the limitations of his “custom- ers,” the other people
(also, often, specialists in their own areas) within the organization.
It is the manager who has to translate the objectives of the
organization into the language of the specialist, and the output of the
specialist into the language of the intended user. It is the manager, in
other words, on whom the specialist depends for the integration of his
output into the work of others.</p>
<p>Yet, while the career professional needs a manager to be effective,
the manager is not his boss. The manager is his “guide,” his “tool,” and
his “marketing arm.” The manager is the channel through which the career
professional, and especially the true specialist, can direct his
knowledge, his work, and his capacities toward joint results, and
through which</p>
<p>*In my book, The Effective Executive, I proposed to call these people
“executives,” the term to embrace both the traditional “managers” and
the nonmanaging professional with responsibility for determining the
objectives of contribution and result of their work, who are expected to
make decisions that affect the performance and wealth-producing
potential of the entire business.</p>
<p>in turn, he finds out the needs, the capacities, and the
opportunities of the enterprise of which he is a member.</p>
<p>In one way, indeed, the true career professional will and should be
the “superior” of his manager. He must be the “teacher” and the
“educator.” It is the career professional’s job to teach management, to
raise its vision, to show new opportunities, new horizons, new and more
demanding standards. In that sense, every career professional should be
expected to be the senior in his relationship to his manager and,
indeed, to managers within the organization. If he does not take the
responsibility for leadership within his area of expertise and knowledge
he is not a true career professional. He is instead a sub- ordinate
“technician.”</p>
<p>Title, Function, and Pay of the Career Professional</p>
<p>The thorny problems of title, function, and pay of managers and
career professionals can- not be completely solved. But they can be
deprived, in substantial measure, of their ca- pacity to disturb and to
misdirect.</p>
<p>Traditionally, there has been only one line of advancement in
organizations; a man could acquire higher pay and status by becoming a
manager. As a result, a good many people who deserved recognition and
reward did not receive them. Or, in order to give recognition and
reward, people who neither wanted to manage nor were competent in doing
so were put into management positions.</p>
<p>This system is inappropriate to the reality of today’s organization,
and especially of today’s business enterprise. Men should be able to
move freely from one kind of work to the other as they advance. We
should therefore have a system of rank and title that differ- entiates
clearly between a man’s function and his standing within the
organization.</p>
<p>In the military services the separation between rank and function has
long been rou- tine. A man is a Major and this establishes his rank. But
it does not tell us whether he is in command of a battalion—that is, a
manager or whether he works in the Pentagon as a researcher—that is, as
an individual professional contributor. His rank is Major; but his
functional title, Battalion Commander or Communications Specialist,
describes his as- signment.</p>
<p>It might make sense to call all members of the management group
executives and to have only four ranks within an organization: junior
executive; executive; senior executive; and corporate executive. Then
one could have a system of rank which cuts across the dis- tinction
between managerial and non-managerial positions. One could, then,
describe a man’s position, whether it be Senior Engineer—Heat Treating
or Manager—Cost Con- trol, and separate thereby rank and function. Such
a system is more likely to succeed than a system which tries to build
“parallel ladders.”</p>
<p>The traditional definition of a manager also implies that he, being
the superior, must get more money than the men who report to him and who
are considered his “inferiors.” This makes sense on the assembly line
and in clerical work. It is also appropriate for the junior knowledge
worker who is not yet a career professional and who is not expected to
take full responsibility for his objectives and contribution. But it
makes little sense for the true professional, that is, for the man who
is considered to be the leader in his field within an enterprise and the
pacesetter within his area. For him, the right rules are those that ap-
ply to “performers,” whether in the arts or in sports.</p>
<p>No one finds it strange that the star baseball player gets more money
than his coach or even the team’s manager. Nobody is surprised that the
prima donna gets more for one appearance that the opera manager may earn
in the entire year. It is clearly understood by everybody that the
top-flight athlete or the outstanding singer needs a manager—and yet
their contributions are different and justify differential payment as a
result of which, the organizationally “subordinate” receives more money
than the “superior,” that is, the man- ager.</p>
<p>There is even an instructive business precedent for this. When Pierre
S. du Pont and Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., first attempted, in 1920, to bring
order into the chaos of the General</p>
<p>Motors Company, they set the same salary for the heads of the
operating divisions as for the president, Pierre du Pont. But, at his
own request, Sloan received substantially less as the operating
vice-president to whom the division heads reported. The manager of a
unit composed of career professionals or specialists will, of course,
receive more money than most of the men in the unit, but it should not
be considered unusual, let alone undesirable, for one or two “stars” of
the group to receive more money than the manager. This can apply just as
well to salesmen; a star salesman should be expected to make more money
than the regional sales manager. It should apply in the research
laboratory, and in all other areas where performance depends on
individual skill, effort, and knowledge.</p>
<p>There should be no distinction between members of the management
group who are managers and those who are career professionals in the
demands made on them. The managers differ from the other professionals
only in having one extra dimension in their responsibility and
performance. The difference between the market research manager with a
staff of fifty people and the market researcher who does the same job
without any staff is in means rather than in contribution, let alone in
function. Both should be held to the same demand. Both are “management”
and “managers.”</p>
<h4 id="the-manager-and-his-work">31 The Manager and His Work</h4>
<p>How Does the Manager Do His Work?—The Work of the
Manager—Information: The Tool of the Manager—Using His Own Time—The
Manager’s Resource: Man— The One Requirement: Character</p>
<p>Tbols of rank. It requires competence and performance of a high
order. But does the</p>
<p>job demand genius? Is it done by intuition or by method? How does the
manager do his work?</p>
<p>A manager has two specific tasks. The first is creation of a true
whole that is larger than the sum of its parts, a productive entity that
turns out more than the sum of the re-</p>
<p>sources put into it. One analogy is the conductor of a symphony
orchestra, through whose effort, vision, and leadership individual
instrumental parts become the living whole of a musical performance. But
the conductor has the composer’s score; he is only interpreter. The
manager is both composer and conductor.</p>
<p>This task requires the manager to make effective whatever strength
there is in his re- sources—above all, in the human resources—and
neutralize whatever there is of weak-</p>
<p>ness. This is the only way in which a genuine whole can be
created.</p>
<p>It requires the manager to balance and harmonize major functions of
the business en- terprise: managing a business; managing worker and
work; and managing the enterprise in</p>
<p>community and society. A decision or action that satisfies a need in
one of these functions by weakening performance in another weakens the
whole enterprise. A decision or action must always be sound in all three
areas.</p>
<p>The task of creating a genuine whole also requires that the manager
in every one of his acts consider simultaneously the performance and
results of the enterprise as a whole and the diverse activities needed
to achieve synchronized performance. It is here, perhaps, that the
comparison with the orchestra conductor fits best. A conductor must
always hear both the whole orchestra and, say, the second oboe.
Similarly, a manager must always consider both the overall performance
of the enterprise and, say, the market research ac- tivity needed. By
raising the performance of the whole, he creates scope and challenge for
market research. By improving the performance of market research, he
makes possible better overall business results. The manager must
simultaneously ask two double-barreled questions: What better business
performance is needed and what does this require of what activities?
And: What better performances are the activities capable of and what im-
provement in business results will they make possible?</p>
<p>The second specific task of the manager is to harmonize in every
decision and action the requirements of immediate and long-range future.
He cannot sacrifice either without endangering the enterprise.* He must,
so to speak, keep his nose to the grindstone while lifting his eyes to
the hills—which is quite an acrobatic feat. Or, to vary the metaphor,
he</p>
<p>*On this see also Chapters 4 and 10.</p>
<p>can afford to say neither “We will cross this bridge when we come to
it,” nor “It’s the next hundred years that count.” He not only has to
prepare for crossing distant bridges— he has to build them long before
he gets there. And if he does not take care of the next hundred days,
there will be no next hundred years—there may not even be a next five
years. Whatever the manager does should be sound in expediency as well
as in basic long- range objective and principle. And where he cannot
harmonize the two time dimensions, he must at least balance them. He
must calculate the sacrifice he imposes on the long- range future of the
enterprise to protect its immediate interests, or the sacrifice he,
makes today for the sake of tomorrow. He must limit either sacrifice as
much as possible. And he must repair as soon as possible the damage it
inflicts. He lives and acts in two time di- mensions, and he is
responsible for the performance of the whole enterprise and of his own
component in it.</p>
<p>The Work of the Manager</p>
<p>Most managers spend most of their time on things that are not
“managing.” A sales man- ager makes a statistical analysis or placates
an important customer. A foreman repairs a tool or fills out a
production report. A manufacturing manager designs a new plant layout or
tests new materials. A company president works through the details of a
bank loan or negotiates a big contract—or spends hours presiding at a
dinner in honor of long-service employees. All these things pertain to a
particular function. All are necessary and have to be done well.</p>
<p>But they are apart from the work which every manager does whatever
his function or activity, whatever his rank and position, work which is
common to all managers and pecu- liar to them. We can apply to the job
of the manager the systematic analysis of scientific management. We can
isolate that which a man does because he is a manager. We can di- vide
it into its constituent operations. And a man can improve his
performance as a man- ager by improving his performance of these
constituent activities.</p>
<p>There are five basic operations in the work of the manager. Together
they result in the integration of resources into a viable growing
organism.</p>
<p>A manager, in the first place, sets objectives. He determines what
the objectives should be. He determines what the goals in each area of
objectives should be. He decides what has to be done to reach these
objectives. He makes the objectives effective by com- municating them to
the people whose performance is needed to attain them.</p>
<p>Second, a manager organizes. He analyzes the activities, decisions,
and relations needed. He classifies the work. He divides it into
manageable activities and further di- vides the activities into
manageable jobs. He groups these units and jobs into an organiza- tion
structure. He selects people for the management of these units and for
the jobs to be done.</p>
<p>Next, a manager motivates and communicates. He makes a team out of
the people that are responsible for various jobs. He does that through
the practices with which he works. He does it in his own relations to
the men with whom he works. He does it through his “people decisions” on
pay, placement, and promotion. And he does it through constant
communication, to and from his subordinates, and to and from his
superior, and to and from his colleagues.</p>
<p>The fourth basic element in the work of the manager is measurement.
The manager es- tablishes yardsticks—and few factors are as important to
the performance of the organiza- tion and of every man in it. He sees to
it that each man has measurements available to him which are focused on
the performance of the whole organization and which, at the same time,
focus on the work of the individual and help him do it. He analyzes,
appraises, and interprets performance. As in all other areas of his
work, he communicates the meaning of the measurements and their findings
to his subordinates, to his superiors, and to col- leagues.</p>
<p>Finally, a manager develops people, including himself.</p>
<p>Every one of these categories can be divided further into
subcategories, and each of the subcategories could be discussed in a
book of its own. Moreover, every category re- quires different qualities
and qualifications.</p>
<p>Setting objectives, for instance, is a problem of balances: a balance
between business results and the realization of the principles one
believes in; a balance between the imme- diate needs of the business and
those of the future; a balance between desirable ends and available
means. Setting objectives clearly requires analytical and synthesizing
ability.</p>
<p>Organizing, too, requires analytical ability. For it demands the most
economical use of scarce resources. But it deals with human beings, and
therefore stands under the principle of justice and requires integrity.
Analytical ability and integrity are similarly required for the
development of people.</p>
<p>The skill needed for motivating and communicating is primarily
social. Instead of analysis, integration and synthesis are needed.
Justice dominates as the principle, econ- omy is secondary. And
integrity is of much greater importance than analytical ability.</p>
<p>Measuring requires, first and foremost, analytical ability. But it
also demands that measurement be used to make self-control possible
rather than abused to control people from the outside and above—that is,
to dominate them. It is the common violation of this principle that
largely explains why measurement is the weakest area in the work of the
manager today. As long as measurements are abused as a tool of control
(for instance, as when measurements are used as a weapon of an internal
secret police that supplies audits and critical appraisals of a
manager’s performance to the boss without even sending a carbon copy to
the manager himself) measuring will remain the weakest area in the man-
ager’s performance.*</p>
<p>Setting objectives, organizing, motivating and communicating,
measuring, and devel- oping people are formal, classifying categories.
Only a manager’s experience can bring them to life, concrete and
meaningful. But because they are formal, they apply to every manager and
to everything he does as a manager. They can therefore be used by every
manager to appraise his own skill and performance and to work
systematically on improv- ing himself and his performance as a
manager.</p>
<p>Being able to set objectives does not make a man a manager, any more
than the ability to tie a small knot in a confined space makes a man a
surgeon. But without ability to set objectives a man cannot be an
adequate manager, just as a man cannot do good surgery without tying
small knots. And as a surgeon becomes a better surgeon by improving his
knot-tying skill, so a manager becomes a better manager by improving his
skill and per- formance in all categories of his work.</p>
<p>The Manager’s Resource: Man</p>
<p>The manager works with a specific resource: man. And the human being
is a unique re- source requiring peculiar qualities in whoever attempts
to work with it.</p>
<p>“Working” the human being always means developing him. The direction
which this development takes decides whether the human being—both as a
man and as a resource— will become more productive or cease, ultimately,
to be productive at all. This applies, as cannot be emphasized too
strongly, not alone to the man who is being managed but also to the
manager. Whether he develops his subordinates in the right direction,
helps them to grow and become bigger and richer persons, will directly
determine whether he himself will develop, will grow or wither, become
richer or become impoverished, improve or deteriorate.</p>
<p>One can learn certain skills in managing people—for instance, the
skill to lead a con- ference or to conduct an interview. One can set
down practices that are conducive to de- velopment—in the structure of
the relationship between manager and subordinate, in a promotion system,
in the rewards and incentives of an organization. But when all is said
and done, developing men still requires a basic quality in the manager
which cannot be</p>
<p>*On this see also Chapter 39.</p>
<p>created by supplying skills or by emphasizing the importance of the
task. It requires integ- rity of character.</p>
<p>There is tremendous stress these days on liking people, helping
people, getting along with people, as qualifications for a manager.
These alone are never enough. In every suc- cessful organization there
is one boss who does not like people, who does not help them, and who
does not get along with them. Cold, unpleasant, demanding, he often
teaches and develops more men than anyone else. He commands more respect
than the most likable man ever could. He demands exacting workmanship of
himself as well as of his men. He sets high standards and expects that
they will be lived up to. He considers only what is right and never who
is right. And though often himself a man of brilliance, he never rates
intellectual brilliance above integrity in others. The manager who lacks
these qualities of character—no matter how likable, helpfu1, or amiable,
no matter even how competent or brilliant—is a menace and should be
adjudged “unfit to be a manager and a gentleman.”</p>
<p>What a manager does can be analyzed systematically. What a manager
has to be able to do can be learned (though perhaps not always taught).
But one quality cannot be learned, one qualification that the manager
cannot acquire but must bring with him. It is not genius; it is
character.</p>

<p>P</p>
<p>OLITICALLY, THE HISTORY OF THE BRITISH RULE OF INDIA is a history of
muddle, indecision, lack of direction and, in the last analysis,
failure. What kept the British in control and power for two hundred
years was, in part, India’s weakness and disunity. But above all, the
British stayed in power because of a supreme administrative
accomplishment: the Indian Civil Service. In its greatest period, the
second half of the nineteenth century, it never numbered more than a
thousand men. Most were very young, mere lads in their early twenties,
for life expectancy was brutally short for the white man in India’s
hostile climate, in which malaria and dysentery were endemic and cholera
an annual visitor.</p>
<p>Most of these young men of the alien race who administered the huge
subcontinent were stationed in total isolation in small villages or on
dusty crossroads in which they did not see for months on end anyone who
spoke their language and shared their concerns. Only a few survived long
enough to retire with modest pensions to the England whence they had
come and of which they always dreamed.</p>
<p>These young men who administered British India were rather dull and
uninteresting.</p>
<p>After a short apprenticeship, they were put into an assignment of
their own to sink or swim.* These men were younger sons of poor country
parsons, with no prospects at home and little standing in English
society. Their pay was low; and such opportunities for loot or gain as
their predecessors had enjoyed in the swashbuckling days of the East
India Company a hundred years earlier had, by 1860, been completely
eliminated by both law and custom.</p>
<p>These untrained, not very bright, and totally inexperienced
youngsters ran districts comparable in size and population to small
European countries. And they ran them practi- cally all by themselves
with a minimum of direction and supervision from the top. Some, of
course, became casualties and broke under the strain, falling victim to
alcohol, to na- tive women or—the greatest danger of them all—to sloth.
But most of them did what they were expected to do, and did it
reasonably well. They gave India, for the first time in its</p>
<p>*Leonard Woolf, who served as a young district commissioner in Ceylon
in the early years of this century, has given the best picture—both of
the isolation and of the challenges of the life—in one volume of his
autobiogra- phy, Growing (Harcount, Brace, 1962).</p>
<p>long and tragic history, peace, a measure of freedom from famine, and
a little security of life, worship, and property. They administered
justice impartially and, at least as far as they themselves were
concerned, honestly and without corruption. They collected taxes, by and
large, impartially and equitably. They did not make policy; and in the
end they foundered because they had none. But they administered, and
administered well.*</p>
<p>This remarkable administrative achievement, the achievement of a
middle manage- ment which, for two hundred long years, could in large
measure offset the top- management failure of the system—or rather, the
fact that there was no top manage- ment—rested on exceedingly simple
foundations.</p>
<p>The jobs the young men were assigned were big and challenging. There
was enough scope in each of them to keep even a good man interested and
occupied for many years. The job was the young man’s own job, and not a
job as an “assistant to” anybody. He was accountable. He was
responsible. And it was up to him to organize the job as he saw fit.
Performance standards were high and uncompromising. A young, basically
untrained and unprepared amateur was expected to give perfect justice;
to be totally impartial; to main- tain public order, safety on the roads
and in the villages, and religious and civil peace. And he had to do
this by persuasion, by the authority of his own person and by his mere
presence; to have to invoke force, for instance to call in the military,
was considered fail- ure. And while the individual job was anonymous,
the Service had high pride in itself and a deep commitment to standards
and mission. It was imbued with the highest spirit.</p>
<p>A manager’s job should be based on a task that has to be done to
attain the company’s objectives. It should always be a real job—one that
makes a visible and, if possible, measurable contribution to the success
of the enterprise. It should have the broadest rather than the narrowest
scope and authority. The manager should be directed and controlled by
the objectives of performance rather than by his boss.</p>
<p>The activities that have to be performed and the contributions that
have to be made to attain the company’s objectives should always
determine what managerial jobs are needed. A manager’s job exists
because the task facing the enterprise demands its exis- tence—and for
no other reason. The job has to have its own authority and its own
respon- sibility. For managers must manage.</p>
<p>The job should always have managerial scope and proportions. Since a
manager is someone who takes responsibility for, and contributes to, the
final results of the enter- prise, the job should always embody the
maximum challenge, carry the maximum respon- sibility, and make the
maximum contribution.</p>
<p>Common Mistakes in Designing Managerial Jobs</p>
<p>There is no formula that will guarantee the right job design for a
managerial job. Yet six common mistakes that impair the effectiveness of
manager and managerial organization can be avoided.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The most common mistake is to design the job so small that a good
man cannot grow. Any managerial job is, in al1 likelihood, a terminal
job—that is, a job on which the incumbent will stay until he retires.
Even in rapidly growing organizations this is the rule rather than the
exception.</li>
</ol>
<p>The number of jobs at the top is inevitably far smaller than the
number of jobs at the bottom. Out of every ten men on a given
organizational level, no more than two or three can normally expect even
one promotion. The rest are likely to stay where they are. They may get
a bigger title and, as a rule, more money. But what they do is unlikely
to change a great deal.</p>
<p>If a job is designed so small that the incumbent can learn everything
about it in a few years, the majority of managers will be frustrated,
bored, and no longer really working.</p>
<p>*The most perceptive book I know on the British in India, Philip
Woodruff’s The Men Who Ruled India (two volumes, St. Martin’s Press,
1954), makes the point that the basic failure of the British was their
belief in the “philosopher king,” that is, ther belief that
administration could suffice and could take the place of policy,
decision, and direction.</p>
<p>They will, so to speak, “retire on the job.” They will resist any
change, any innovation, any new idea, for change can only be a change
for the worse for them and threaten their security. Knowing very well
that they are not actually contributing any more, they are fundamentally
insecure.</p>
<p>Managerial jobs should, therefore, be designed so as to enable a man
to grow, to learn, and to develop for many years to come. There is
little harm, as a rule, in a job that is de- signed too big. This
mistake shows up soon and can easily be corrected. A job that is too
small, however, is an insidious, slow poison which paralyzes both the
man and the or- ganization.</p>
<p>Al1 managerial jobs should be designed to provide satisfaction
through performance.</p>
<p>They should in themselves challenge and reward. If the main
satisfaction of the job is promotion, the job itself has lost
significance and meaning. And since the majority of men in managerial
positions are bound to be disappointed in their hopes for promotion—by
arithmetic rather than by organization politics—it is unwise to focus on
promotion whether in compensation structure, in recognition, or in
manager development. The em- phasis should always be on the job itself
rather than on the next job.</p>
<p>In fact, there are few things quite as dangerous as an organization
in which promotions are so rapid as to become the accepted reward for
doing a decent jab. When this boom comes to an end, as all booms do
sooner or later, entire groups are bound to become dis- gruntled. The
men who rose fast but did not quite make it to the top will find
themselves boxed in behind men not much older than they are, who got to
the top by the sheer acci- dent of having started in the organization a
little earlier. The men who entered the organi- zation just before the
boom peaked will have expectations based on the careers of their
seniors, which are bound to be disappointed.</p>
<p>An extreme example is the situation of some of the large New York
commercial banks. Very few young people were hired in the banking
industry in the thirties and for- ties when commercial banks in New York
were shrinking rather than expanding. When the banking business expanded
again after World War II, a series of mergers (such as the one between
the Chase Bank and the Bank of the Manhattan Company, which created the
Chase Manhattan; or that between the National City Bank and the First
National Bank of New York, which created the First National City)
actually created a surplus of managers. By the early fifties, however,
large numbers of the men, who had started before 1929, reached
retirement age, and the banks began to hire large numbers of youngsters,
fresh out of college or graduate business school. Within seven or eight
years many of them rose to positions of substantial pay and exalted
title such as vice-president and senior vice- president. Before they
were thirty large numbers of these “young comers” reached, in other
words, what must be their terminal position. Yet—in large part because
these young men did not have much experience—these jobs, whatever the
big title and the good sal- ary, are quite limited in scope and
authority. By the time they reach forty, these men are going to be
bored, cynical, frustrated, and no longer excited about the job and its
chal- lenge.</p>
<p>A company that is expanding rapidly is well-advised to bring into
important positions a few seasoned and older outsiders, who have made a
career elsewhere. Otherwise it is bound to create expectations among its
own young managers, which, a few years later, it must frustrate.</p>
<p>The Importance of Age Balance</p>
<p>Another important reason why jobs and a job structure focused on
rapid promotion are to be avoided is that they result in an unbalanced
age structure. Both an age structure that is overbalanced on the side of
youth and one overbalanced on the side of age create serious
organizational turbulence.</p>
<p>The management structure needs continuity and self-renewal. There
must be continu- ity so that the organization does not have to replace
all of a sudden a large number of ex- perienced but old managers with
new and untried men. And there has to be enough</p>
<p>“managerial metabolism” so that new ideas and new faces can assert
themselves. A man- agement group that is of the same age is a management
group headed for crisis. Yet the management group that is uniformly old
may be preferable to the one that is uniformly too young. At least, the
crisis comes sooner and is over faster.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Worse even than the job that is too small is the job that is not
really a job, the job of the typical “assistant to.”</li>
</ol>
<p>The managerial job must have specific objectives and a specific
purpose and function.</p>
<p>A manager must be able to make a contribution which can be
identified. He must be ac- countable.</p>
<p>But the typical assistant does not have a job that can make a
contribution. He cannot be held accountable and his function, purpose,
and objectives cannot be identified. He is a “helper” who does whatever
the boss thinks he needs done or whatever the assistant can “sell” to
the boss. Such a job corrupts. The holder becomes either a wire-puller
who abuses his intimacy with an important executive or a toady who tries
to make his career by licking his boss’s boots. The assistant position
also corrupts the organization. No one ever knows what the role,
authority, and actual power of the assistant are. As a rule, other
managers will flatter him, use him, and exploit his insecurity of
tenure.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the title “assistant” has to be eschewed—the
reality should be avoided.</p>
<p>Also, a specific, detailed assignment for a young manager may be
excellent training.</p>
<p>But, preferably, it should be limited in time; after finishing one
such special assignment a man should normally go back to a regular
managerial job.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Managing is work. But it is not, by itself, full-time work. The way
to design a managerial job is to combine “managing” with “working,” that
is, responsibility for a spe- cific function or job of one’s own. As a
rule, the manager should be both a manager and an individual career
professional.</li>
</ol>
<p>A manager should have enough to do—otherwise he is likely to try to
do his subordi- nates’ work for them. The common complaint that managers
do not “delegate” usually means that managers do not have enough to do
and therefore take on the job the subordi- nate should be doing. But
also, it is rather frustrating not to have work ot one’s own— especially
for people who have grown up in the habit of work. And it is not
particularly desirable for a man not to have a job of his own. He soon
loses the sense of workmanship and the respect for hard work without
which, however, a manager is likely to do more harm than good. A manager
should be a “working boss” rather than a “coordinator.”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>As far as possible, a manager’s job should be designed so that it
can be done by one man working by himself and with the people in the
unit which he manages. It is a mistake to design a job so that it
requires continuous meetings, continuous “cooperation” and “co-
ordination.” There is no need, especially not in managerial jobs, to
provide for more “human relations.” The job by its very nature requires
far more human relations than most people are capable of. And one can
either work or meet. One cannot do both at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another mistake that is fairly common—and usually unnecessary—is to
design a job in which the incumbent has to spend a great deal of time
traveling. Just as one cannot meet and work at the same time, one cannot
travel and work at the same time. Person-to- person and face-to-face
meetings with colleagues, associates, subordinates, customers, and
superiors are absolutely essential. There is no substitute. But it is
far better to spend a substantial amount of time once every two years
with the managers and the main custom- ers of a subsidiary company than
to “commute”—that is, leave New York on Tuesday, spend Wednesday in
Paris, and be back on the job in New York on Thursday. This means only
that no work gets done for four days: one needs, after all, at least one
day to recover from this futile attempt to be in two places at once.</p>

<li>Titles should never be used as rewards, let alone to cover up lack
of function. Titles “in lieu of a raise” are not nearly as bad, nor as
common, as titles “in lieu of a job.”</li>
</ol>
<p>An example is the large commercial bank, both in the United States
and in Germany.</p>
<p>In the United States everybody has to be a vice-president or at least
an officer. In Ger-</p>
<p>many everybody has to be a Herr Direktor. There are reasons for this.
The customer of a bank, say, the head of a small business, will not
discuss his financial problems with any- body but an officer. But this
also deforms. It makes those who do not get the title, for instance
because their job does not entail close customer contact, exceedingly
dissatisfied. It adds greatly to the dissatisfaction of people who reach
the exalted title of vice-president at an early age and then find that
they are locked into the same humdrum routine for the rest of their
working lives.</p>
<p>One reason for the misuse of title has been discussed irr Chapter 30:
the tradition in business (but also in government) to use the
identification of function (e.g., manager of market research) as
indicator of rank. Another common reason is the narrowness of salary
ranges under many wage and salary plans; in order to give a man the
raise he has earned by performance it is necessary under these plan to
pretend that he has been promoted to a different and bigger job.
Finally, the traditional limitation of career opportunities in busi-
ness to managerial positions often leads to inventing a fancy and
managerial-sounding title (e.g., Coordinator of Materials Planning for a
senior purchasing clerk) for an experi- enced and accomplished
specialist, who continues, of course, to do precisely what he has been
doing all along.</p>
<p>The rule should be: for first-rate work we pay—and pay well. But we
change title only when a man’s function, position, and responsibility
change.*</p>
<p>Titles do create expectations. They do imply rank and responsibility.
To use them as empty gestures—that is, as substitutes for rank and
responsibility—is asking for trouble.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Finally, jobs that are “widow-makers” should be rethought and
restructured. In the heyday of the great sailing sltips, around 1850,
just before the coming of steam, every shipping company had a
“widow-maker” on its hands once in a while. This was a ship which, for
reasons nobody could figure out, tended to get out of control and kill
people. After it had done this a few times a prudent shipowner pulled
the ship out of service and broke it up, no matter how much money he had
invested in it. Otherwise, he soon found himself without captains or
mates.</li>
</ol>
<p>In many companies there are jobs which manage to defeat one good man
after the other—without any clear reason why. These jobs seem to be
logical, seem to be well con- structed, seem to be do-able—yet nobody
seems to be able to do them. If a job has de- feated, in a row, two men
who in their previous assignments have done well, it should be
restructured. It then usually becomes clear, though ony by hindsight,
what was wrong with the job in the first place.</p>
<p>A typical “widow-maker” has been the job of international
vice-president in a large American company. Nobody seems to know why the
job should not work, but in the great majority of cases one good man
after the other fails in it. The reason is usually that the company has
outgrown the volume of business which justifies treating “international”
as a stepchild. (On this, see Chapter 59, “The Multinational
Corporation.”) But this becomes clear only in retrospect, after one has
restructured the job and has found the man—or men—who can do the
work.</p>
<p>In a good many consumer-goods companies—Procter andandandand Gamble
is an example—there is a top marketing manager and a top promotion and
advertising manager, both members of the company’s top management.
Logically this should be one position since promotion and advertising
are part of marketing. These companies have learned, however, that com-
bining these two functions into one job usually means frustrating and
defeating a good man. The reason, as one consumer-goods executive once
put it, is that “marketing aims at moving goods, promotion aims at
moving people.” These two aims require men of differ-</p>
<p>*I would exempt from the rule “honorifics” that primarily bespeak
seniority such as “junior” and “senior,” especially for individual
career professionals but would then strongly insist that such titles be
used only to denote seniority—more or less in the fashion in which the
title monsignor in the Catholic Church (at least in the U.S.) is almost
automatically bestowed on any man who has served twenty-five years in
the priesthood and stayed out of trouble.</p>
<p>ent temperament who look at their work differently and apply
different measurements of performance to themselves and to their
units.</p>
<p>The “widow-maker” job is usually the result of accident. One man who
somehow combined in himself temperamental characteristics which are not
usually found in one person, created the job and acquitted himself well.
In other words, what looked like a logical job was an accident of
personality rather than the result of a genuine function. But</p>
<p>one cannot replace personality.</p>
<p>Job Structure and Personality</p>
<p>The abuse of titles and the “widow-maker” job relate closely to one
of the most hotly de- bated issues with respect to managerial jobs and
managerial structure: Should the organi- zation be structured so that
jobs fit people? Or should the organization be “functional,” with people
fitted to jobs?</p>
<p>As commonly propounded, this is a pseudo-problem. Quite obviously,
people have to fill the jobs, and therefore jobs have to fit people. We
will indeed have to design jobs that really fit people, answer their
needs, and fulfill their expectations. We will, increasingly, see
“organization planning” in large companies, that is, attempts to make
jobs fit people and serve them.</p>
<p>There is also no doubt that organization structure has to be
impersonal and task- focused. Otherwise it is impossible to have
continuity and to have people succeed each other. If the job is designed
for an individual rather than for a task, it has to be restruc- tured
every time there is a change in the incumbent. And, as experienced
managers know, one cannot restructure one job. There is a true “domino
effect,” a true chain reaction. Re- structuring a job usually means
restructuring a score of jobs, moving people around, and upsetting
everybody.</p>
<p>There is one exception: the exceedingly rare, truly exceptional man
for whose sake the rule should be broken.</p>
<p>Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., the architect of General Motors, was adamant
that jobs had to be impersonal and task-focused.* But he made one
exception fo accommodate one of the great inventors of our century,
Charles F. Kettering. Kettering was an exceedingly diffi- cult man, and
also a man who disregarded every single organizational rule. Yet his
inven- tions, from the self-starter to the redesign of the diesel
engine, were of major importance. Sloan offered to set up Kettering as
an independent researcher. But Kettering wanted to be vice-president and
a “big businessman.” Sloan gave in, but the moment Kettering re- tired,
the job was redesigned—from “resident genius” to manager of a large
research laboratory.</p>
<p>The design of a job has to start out with the task, but it also has
to be a design that can accommodate people with different temperaments,
habits, and behavior patterns. This is a major reason why managerial
jobs ought to be designed big rather than small. A job has to be big
enough so that a good man can find within it his own satisfaction and
achieve- ment, his own way and method of working.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church offers an instructive lesson. The basic manager
within the Catho- lic Church is the bishop. It has long been the custom
to rotate temperaments in filling a bishop’s See. If the incumbent is a
pastor, concerned primarily with the care of souls, he may be succeeded
by a theologian or by an administrator. In turn, a first-rate
administra- tor is likely to be succeeded by a man whose main emphasis
is on his priestly function, and so on. The Catholic Church learned long
ago that the three qualifications—those of pastor, theologian, and
administrator—are unlikely fo be found in one person. Yet all three are
needed to keep a diocese alive. Hence the bishop’s job is designed very
big in- deed—big enough for a good man to make of it what suits him. And
the standard of ac- complishment is set by rotating the temperaments
that occupy the See in succession.</p>
<p>*See Sloan’s book, My Years with General Motors.</p>
<p>The Span of Managerial Relationships</p>
<p>In discussing how big a manager’s job should be, the textbooks often
start out with the observation that one man can supervise only a very
small number of people—the so- called span of control. This in turn
leads to that deformation of management: levels upon levels which impede
cooperation and communication, stifle the development of tomor- row’s
managers, and erode the meaning of the management job.</p>
<p>In the first place, the principle of the span of control is rarely
cited properly. It is not how many people report to a manager that
matters. It is how many people who have to work with each other report
to a manager. What counts are the number of relationships rather than
the number of men.</p>
<p>The president of a company who has reporting to him a number of
senior executives, each concerned with a major function, should indeed
keep the number of direct subordi- nates to a fairly low number—between
eight and twelve is probably the limit. For these men—the chief
financial officer, the head of manufacturing, the head of marketing, and
so on—have to work every day with each other and with the company’s
president. If they do not work together, they do not work at all.
Therefore, the president is engaged in a great many relationships even
though the number of direct subordinates may be quite small.</p>
<p>By contrast, a regional vice-president of Sears, Roebuck can—and
does—have several hundred store managers report to him. Each store is
discrete and autonomous. There is no need whatever for interaction
between two different stores. All the stores do the same kind of work
and have the same job. They can all be appraised and measured by the
same yardsticks. Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of store
managers a regional vice-president of Sears can manage and supervise.
The limit is set by geography rather than by the span of control.</p>
<p>The second shortcoming of the span of control argument is that it
assumes that a man- ager’s main relationship is downward. But this is
only one dimension. The manager, in the traditional definition as the
man responsible for the work of other people, has a downward
relationship, to be sure. But every manager and every career
professional also has a superior. Indeed many managers, no matter what
the organization chart says, have more than one boss. And the upward
relationship to the superior is at least equal in impor- tance to the
downward relationship to the subordinates. Most important, however,
manag- ers and career professionals always have sideways relations,
relationships with people who are neither their subordinates nor their
superiors and, indeed, stand in no relationship of authority and
responsibility to them. Yet these relationships are crucial both for the
manager’s own ability to do his work, and for the effectiveness of his
work.</p>
<p>For example, the most important relationships for managers and career
professionals in accounting are not the relationships to the company
controller or to the junior account- ants. They are their relationships
to operating managers. The accounting manager’s con- tribution depends
on the ability and willingness of the operating managers to use as in-
formation and input what accounting produces. Conversely, the accounting
manager’s ability to perform depends on the willingness and ability of
the operating managers to</p>
<p>furnish him the information he needs. Yet accounting people, as a
rule, slight this rela- tionship no matter how much lip service they may
pay to it.</p>
<p>Similarly, the basic weakness of a good many research managers and
scientists is the neglect of their sideways relationships, especially
their relationships with the marketing people. As a result, research
quite often is uninformed regarding the needs and opportuni- ties of the
company and, conversely, valuable results of research remain unused
because the marketing people simply do not understand what research is
trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>What is needed, therefore, is to replace the concept of the span of
control with another and more relevant concept: the span of managerial
relationships.</p>
<p>We do not know how wide this span can be—though, assuredly, there are
limits. But we do know that the span of managerial relationships is
crucial in the design of a manage- rial job.</p>
<p>In the first place, these relationships define the place of the
manager within the mana- gerial structure. Second, they very largely
define what his job is—for these relationships are a crucial and
essential part of the job content. Finally, they do set limits—since a
job that is only “relationships” and no “work” is not a job at all. In
designing managerial jobs it is as important to think through the
managerial relationships and to make sure that they do not exceed an
individual’s grasp as it is to think through the specific function.</p>
<p>Again it is better to make the span of managerial responsibilities
too wide than too narrow. This goes for the number of subordinates with
whom a manager works and who constitute his unit and his team. It goes
also for his upward relationships. The only area in which I would
strongly counsel to keep rather tight limits on the span of managerial
rela- tionships are the sideways relationships. A managerial job,
ideally, should have a small number of sideways relationships—every one
of them of prime importance, both for the functioning of the entire
organization and for the achievement of the manager’s own func- tion and
objectives. It is not only that these are time-consuming relationships.
If there are too many, they will be treated superficially, will not be
thought through, and will not be worked at. And the common weakness of
many organizations is, by and large, the lack of adequate concern for,
and adequate work on, sideways relationships.</p>
<p>Defining a Manager’s Job</p>
<p>A manager’s job is defined in several ways.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is first the specific function, the job itself. This should
always be a perma- nent, continuing job, one that is considered, in the
light of the best available knowledge at the time, to be needed for a
good long time to come. An example would be manager of market research
or manufacturing manager. Both obviously are jobs which will have to be
done for the foreseeable future.</p></li>
<li><p>But the functional definition of the job, which is what is
expressed in the typical job description or position guide, does not
define the specific contribution which a specific manager is expected to
make. While the function is, at least in intent, permanent, there are
assignments “here and now” which are what the enterprise and the
manager’s boss should hold the man accountable for. They contribute the
second definition of a managerial posi- tion and job.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As I have said elsewhere, every manager should ask himself the
question at least once a year, and always when taking on a new job:
“What specific contribution can I and my unit make which, if done really
well, would make a substantial difference to the perform- ance and
results of my company?”*</p>
<p>The position guide and job description are, so to speak, the mission
statement of a managerial job. They correspond to the definition of
“what is our business and what should it be for the enterprise as a
whole. The assignments are the objectives and goals and therefore need
specific targets, a deadline, a clear statement of who is accountable,
and a built-in measurement by feedback from results.</p>
<p>*In my book, The Effective Executive.</p>
<p>Every manager should ask himself: “What information do I need to do
my job and where do I get it?” He should make sure that whoever has to
provide that information understands the manager’s needs—not only in
terms of what is needed but also how it is needed.</p>
<p>This is particularly important today, when “management information”
means increas- ingly “computer.” The basic problem with the computer in
business is not that computer technicians do not understand the
managers’ needs. It is that the managers do not take the time and
trouble to think through their needs and to communicate them to the
computer people.* How the computer people satisfy the needs of the
manager is their business. What the needs are is the manager’s business.
To expect the computer people to define the information needs of the
managers is abdication.</p>
<p>Managers need to think through the question “And who depends on
information from me, and in what form, upward, downward, and
sideways?”</p>
<p>Each of these four definitions of the managerial job is only a
partial definition. All four are needed to define the manager’s job—just
as one triangulates a position on a map.</p>
<p>These four definitions which “triangulate” a manager’s job are the
manager’s own re- sponsibility. He should be expected to write his own
job description; to work out his own proposal for the results and
contributions for which he and his unit should be accountable; to work
out and think through his relationships; and finally to define both his
information needs and his information contribution. Indeed,
responsibility for thinking through the four dimensions of his job is a
manager’s first responsibility, of which he should never be relieved.
His superior has both the duty and the responsibility to approve or to
disapprove what the individual manager proposes. But the responsibility
for thinking and proposing is the manager’s. There is no difference
between a “managing” job, i.e., one with direct responsibility for the
work of other people, and a job as a career professional.</p>
<p>The Manager’s Authority</p>
<p>That each manager’s job be given the broadest possible scope and
authority is nothing but a rephrasing of the rule that decisions be
pushed down the line as far as possible and be taken as close as
possible to the action to which they apply. In its effects, however,
this requirement leads to sharp deviations from the traditional concept
of delegation from above.</p>
<p>What activities and tasks the enterprise requires is worked out at
the top. The analysis begins with the desired end product: the
objectives of business performance and business results. From these the
analysis determines step by step what work has to be performed.</p>
<p>But in organizing the manager’s job we have to work from the bottom
up. We have to begin with the activities on the “firing line”—the jobs
responsible for the actual output of goods and services, for the final
sale to the customer, for the production of blueprints and engineering
drawings.</p>
<p>The managers on the firing line have the basic management jobs—the
ones on whose performance everything else ultimately rests. Seen this
way, the jobs of higher manage- ment are derivative, are, in the last
analysis, aimed at helping the firing-line manager do his job. Viewed
structurally and organically, it is the firing-line manager in whom all
au- thority and responsibility center; only what he cannot do himself
passes up to higher man-</p>
<p>*On this see also Chapters 38 and 40.</p>
<p>agement. He is, so to speak, the gene of organization in which all
higher organs are pre- figured and out of which they are developed.</p>
<p>Quite obviously there are real limits to the decisions the
firing-line manager can or should make, and to the authority and
responsibility he should have.</p>
<p>He is limited as to the extent of his authority. A production foreman
has no business changing a salesman’s compensation. A regional sales
manager has no authority in some- body else’s region, etc. A manager is
also limited with respect to the kind of decision he can make. Clearly,
he should not make decisions that affect other managers. He should not
alone make decisions that affect the whole business and its spirit. It
is only elementary prudence, for instance, not to allow any manager to
make by himself and without review a decision on the career and future
of one of his subordinates.</p>
<p>The firing-line manager should not be expected to make decisions
which he cannot make. A man responsible for immediate performance does
not have the time, for instance, to make long-range decisions. A
production man lacks the knowledge and competence to work out a pension
plan or a medical program. These decisions certainly affect him and his
operations; he should know them, understand them, indeed participate as
much as is humanly possible in their preparation and formulation. But he
cannot make them. Hence he cannot have the authority and responsibility
for them; for authority and responsibility should always be
task-focused. This applies all through the management hierarchy up to
the chief executive himself.</p>
<p>of the old Prussian idea of a citizen’s rights: “Everything that is
not expressly ordered is forbidden.” In other words, the decisions which
a manager is not entitled to make within the extent of his task should
always be spelled out; for all others he should be supposed to have
authority and responsibility.</p>
<p>The Manager, His Superiors, His Subordinates, and the Enterprise</p>
<p>The manager’s relationship to his superior and his relationship to
his subordinate are two- way relationships. Both are formal and informal
relationships of authority as well as of information. Both are
relationships of mutual dependence.*</p>
<p>Every manager has the task of contributing what his superior’s unit
needs to attain its objectives. Every manager should think through what
he and his unit need to do—and in what manner—to make his superior
perform and achieve.</p>
<p>The manager has responsibilities downward, to his subordinates. He
has first to make sure that they know and understand what is demanded of
them. He has to help them set their own objectives. Then he has to help
them to reach these objectives. He is responsi- ble for their getting
the tools, the staff, the information they need. He has to help them
with advice and counsel, and, if need be, to teach them how to do
better. If a one-word definition of this downward relationship be
desired, “assistance” would come closest.</p>
<p>The objectives of a managerial unit should always consist of the
performance that it has to contribute to the success of the enterprise.
Objectives should always and exclu- sively focus upward.</p>
<p>But the objectives of the manager who heads the units include what he
himself has to do to help his subordinates attain their objectives. The
vision of a manager should always be upward—toward the enterprise as a
whole. But his responsibility runs downward as well—to the men on his
team. That this relationship toward them be clearly understood as duty
toward them and as responsibility for making them perform and achieve
rather than as “supervision” is a central requirement for organizing the
manager’s unit effectively.</p>
<p>*This Japan understands much better than the West does, if only
because Japan did not take its concepts of organization from the
militaty, as we did in the West. On this see Chie Nakarne, op. cit.</p>
<p>The final duty of the manager is toward the enterprise. For his job
and function are grounded in the objective needs of the enterprise
rather than in title or delegation of</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>Each manager, therefore, has to derive from the objectives of the
enterprise the defini- tion of his own objectives and those of the unit
he heads.</p>
<p>The discussion in this chapter has focused on the manager in business
enterprise. But eve- rything said here applies just as much to the
manager in the public-service institution, and especially to the manager
in the government agency. He needs a job big enough for a good man to
grow in. He needs satisfaction through performance rather than through
promotion or title. His job needs to be designed around job and
position; assignments; relationships; and information needs. He needs
authority to do his task. And he has to derive his own objectives from
those of the institution he serves.</p>
<p>Indeed, as has been said before (in Chapters 11 through 14), the
manager in the pub- lic-service institution needs proper job design,
proper job content, and proper job struc- ture even more than the
manager in a business. Yet, few public-service institutions seem to pay
much attention to managerial jobs; their emphasis tends to be on title
rather than on function, on procedure rather than on performance. The
design of truly managerial jobs is the first—but may also be the
biggest—step toward improving both performance and mo- rale in
public-service institutions.</p>

Managers</h4>
<p>The Management Development Boom—Why Management Development and
Manager Development are Needed—What They Are Not—The Two Dimensions of
Develop- ment—Designing the Jobs and Skills for
Tomorrow—Self-Development of the Indi- vidual—The Role of Company and
Superior in Self-Development</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>HE YEARS SINCE 1950 have seen a within the wider management boom.
In</p>
<p>veritable management development boom the mid-forties, when I first
became inter-</p>
<p>ested in this subject, I could find only two companies that had given
serious thought to the development of managers: Sears, Roebuck in
America and Marks andandandand Spencer in England. At that time there
were only three university programs in America for the con- tinuing
advanced education of managers: the Sloan Program at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology; the programs at New York University. Graduate
Business School for the continuing education of managers and young
professionals in banking and finance; and then, brand-new, the Advanced
Management Program at the Harvard Business School.</p>
<p>Ten years later, in the mid-fifties, when an attempt was made to
catalog the companies with specific management development programs, the
number already ran to some three thousand. And a great many universities
in the United States had gone into all kinds of advanced management
programs.</p>
<p>Today, it is no longer possible to count the number of companies
that, one way or an- other, work on the development of management and
managers. The large company that does not make specific provision for
such work and does not have a management devel- opment staff of its own
is the exception. And so is the business school at university level
without some form of management development program. In addition, an
untold number of outside organizations: trade associations, consulting
firms, and so on, have gone into the management development
business.</p>
<p>This interest is by no means confined to the United States. It has
spread to Europe and to Japan. Within the last few years it has broken
through the Iron Curtain. Some of the Soviet satellites, such as
Czechoslovakia, have started advanced management work and in 1910, the
Soviet Union itself set up two major advanced management schools for
indus- trial executives.</p>
<p>Why Management Development?</p>
<p>Basic business decisions require an increasingly long time span for
their fruition. Since no one can foresee the future, management cannot
make rational and responsible decisions unless it selects, develops, and
tests the men who will have to follow them through and bail them out—the
managers of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Management is becoming increasingly complex. In addition to a rapid
changing tech- nology, management today has to be able to handle many
new “relations” problems— relations with the government, relations with
suppliers and customers, relations with em-</p>
<p>ployees and with labor unions. On top of this are demands for
entrepreneurship and inno- vation; for managing knowledge and the
knowledge worker; for multinational and, often, multicultural
management; or for managerial responsibility for the environment and for
the quality of life. All these increase the standards against which
managers are measured.</p>
<p>The numerical demand for executives is steadily growing. A developed
society in- creasingly replaces manual skill with theoretical knowledge
and the ability to organize and to lead—in short with managerial
ability. In fact, ours is the first society in which the basic question
is not “How many educated people can society spare from the task of pro-
viding subsistence?” It is “How many uneducated people can we afford to
support?”</p>
<p>But management development is also necessary to discharge an
elementary responsi- bility which a business enterprise owes to society;
if business does not discharge this ob- ligation by its own actions,
society will impose it. For continuity, especially of the big business
enterprise, is vital. Our society will not tolerate—and cannot afford—to
see such wealth-producing resources jeopardized through lack of
competent successors to today’s management.</p>
<p>The member of a modern society looks to his work for more than a
livelihood. He looks to it also for satisfactions that go beyond the
economic, that is, for pride, self- respect, and achievement. Management
development is only another name for making work and industry more than
a way of making a living. By offering challenges and oppor- tunities for
the individual development of each manager to his fullest ability, the
enter- prise discharges, in part, the obligation to make a job in
industry a “good life.” And if we know one thing today, it is that
managers are made and not born. There has to be system- atic work on the
supply, the development, and the skills of tomorrow’s management. It
cannot be left to luck or chance.</p>
<p>Why Manager Development?</p>
<p>The individual manager needs development just as much as company and
society do. He should, first, keep himself alert and mentally alive. He
needs to keep himself challenged. He must acquire today the skills which
will make him effective tomorrow. He also needs an opportunity to
reflect on the meaning of his own experience and—above all—he needs</p>
<p>an opportunity to reflect on himself and to learn to make his
strengths count.</p>
<p>And then he needs development as a person even more than he needs
development as a manager.</p>
<p>One of the strengths, but also one of the weaknesses of a knowledge
worker, i.e., man- ager and career professional, is to expect
satisfaction and stimulation from one’s work. In that respect, the
knowledge worker is badly spoiled during his early formative years. The
manual worker, whether skilled or unskilled, does not expect the work to
challenge him, to stimulate him, to develop him. He expects a living
from the work. The knowledge worker expects a life out of it.</p>
<p>Thus, the knowledge worker, and especially the highly accomplished
knowledge worker is likely to find himself in a spiritual crisis in his
early or mid-forties. By that time the great majority will have reached,
inevitably, their terminal positions. Perhaps they will also have
reached what, within their business, is their terminal function—whether
this be market research, personnel training, or metallurgy. Suddenly
their work will not satisfy them any more. After fifteen or twenty years
in market research in their industry, they know all there is to know
about it. What, in his early thirties, when the job was new, was
tremendous excitement to a man, is boring and humdrum fifteen years
later.</p>
<p>A manager has to be able, in other words, to develop a life of his
own, and outside the organization, before he is in his mid-forties.</p>
<p>He needs this for himself, but he needs it also for the organization.
For the manager who, at age forty-five, “retires on the job” because he
has no more interest in life, is not likely to make any further
contribution to the business. He owes it to himself and to the
business—to develop himself as a person, so that he can build his own
life and not depend</p>
<p>entirely upon the organization, additional promotion, or on new and
different work. He needs to focus on his own personality, on his own
strengths, and on his own interests.</p>
<p>We will (as I have discussed in another book)* have to learn to
develop second ca- reers for accomplished professional and managerial
people when they reach their late forties or so. We will have to learn
to make it possible for the good accountant in a bank to become
comptroller of a hospital or business manager of a college. We will have
to make it possible for people who have worked for twenty years or so in
a business and in a function that is, for the great majority of
managers—to find new challenge, new opportu- nity, and new contributions
in doing something different, or at least in being effective in
different surroundings and in a different institution.</p>
<p>No manager today can be considered as discharging his duty toward
himself toward his family, and also toward his employer, the enterprise,
unless he makes himself ready for such new opportunity.</p>
<p>There are, thus, good reasons why the development of management and
managers has become a central concern.</p>
<p>But what do we really mean by the terms “management development” and
“manager development”? Any boom such as we have experienced these last
two decades is suspect. Undoubtedly there have been as many fads and
follies as there have been sound ventures. There must be—and there
are—quite a few charlatans, and many more who preach man- agement
development only because it is the fashionable thing to do.</p>
<p>What Management Development Is Not</p>
<p>For these reasons, it is best to start by spelling out what
management and manager devel- opment are not.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is not taking courses. Courses are a tool of management
development. But they are not management development.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any course—whether it is a three-day seminar in a special skill or a
two-year “ad- vanced” program three evenings a week—has to fit the
development needs of a manage- ment group or the development needs of an
individual manager. But the job, the superior, and the development
planning of both company and individual are far more important
developmental tools than any course or courses.</p>
<p>Indeed, some of the most popular courses are of questionable value. I
have come to doubt, e.g., the wisdom of courses which take a manager
away from his job for long peri- ods of time. The most effective
courses, in my experience, are those which are done on the manager’s own
time and after hours, e.g., the evening programs offered by a good many
metropolitan universities in the United States, or, for instance, by the
Polytechnic Colleges in Great Britain. And the most effective full-time
courses alternate periods at school with periods of work; a man spends a
week or two off the job in an intensive learn- ing experience, after
which he gets back to his job and applies what he has learned.</p>
<p>Managers are action-focused; they are not philosophers and should not
be. Unless they can put into action right away the things they have
learned, the things they have consid- ered and reconsidered, the course
will not “take.” It will remain “information” and never become
“knowledge.” Pedagogically it is not sound not to have the reaffirmation
of action to strengthen learning, that is, not to be able to put into
practice on Monday what one has learned the preceding Friday. Finally,
the manager who has been away 13 weeks on an advanced course may well
find himself a “displaced person” and homeless when he gets back to his
organization after such a long absence.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have learned to be wary of courses for top management.
Not that top- management people do not have a good deal to learn; they
do. But most of the courses I have seen (including some famous ones) are
not courses for top-management people but for youngsters without
experience and without responsibility. Only the fee is “top-
management.” Such a course is a waste of top-management time.</p>
<p>*The Age of Discontinuity.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Manager development and management development are not promotion
planning, replacement planning, or finding potential. These are useless
exercises. They may even do harm.</li>
</ol>
<p>The worst thing a company can do is to try to develop the “comers”
and leave out the others. Ten years hence, 80 percent of the work will
have to be done by those left out. If they have not developed themselves
to the point where they can understand, accept, and put into action the
vision of the few “comers,” nothing will happen. The eight men out of
every ten who were not included in the program will, understandably,
feel slighted. They may end up by becoming less effective, less
productive, less willing to do new things than they were before.</p>
<p>The attempt to find “potential” is altogether futile. It is less
likely to succeed than ran- dom selection, e.g., taking every fifth man.
Potential is elusive. By itself it is worthless. Performance counts. And
the correlation between promise and performance is not a par- ticularly
high one. Five out of every ten “high potential” young men turn out to
be nothing but good talkers by the time they reach forty. Conversely,
five out of every ten young men who do not look “brilliant” and do not
talk a good game will have proven their capacity to perform by the time
they are in their early forties.</p>
<p>Also, the idea that the purpose of management development is to find
“replacements”</p>
<p>negates the entire reason for the activity. We need management
development and manager development precisely because tomorrow’s jobs
and tomorrow’s organization can be as- sumed, with high probability, to
be different from today’s jobs and today’s organization. If all we had
to do were to replace yesterday’s and today’s jobs, we would not need
any such activity. We would be training people as apprentices under
their present bosses and hope that they learn what their present bosses
know and do.</p>
<p>I used to be in favor of replacement planning such as Joe Hyman
preached and prac- ticed when he tried to convert moribund English
textile companies into new, vital enter- prises through his Viyella
mergers. Hyman asked each executive of the companies ac- quired to name
the man he would like to see as his successor, should he be promoted,
become disabled, or die tomorrow. I am no longer advocating this
practice. It is taken by the organization itself as a promise that the
job of an executive, as it exists today, will be continued in
perpetuity. Second, it freezes future selection. In a few years the man
named today as the most qualified successor may have proven his
incompetence. Or another man may have come from nowhere to overtake him.
Yet once a man has been named, there is a commitment that tends to
become binding. The worst kind of replacement planning is the search for
a “crown prince.” A crown prince either has a legal right to succeed; or
else nomination is likely to destroy him. No matter how carefully
concealed, picking a crown prince is an overt act which the whole
organization very rapidly perceives. And then all the other possible
contenders unite against the crown prince and work to bring him down—and
they usually succeed.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church long ago recognized this. It will not single out
anyone as a suc- cessor to a bishop or archbishop except in rare cases
when the incumbent is obviously old or very ill. Then, however, it will
appoint an auxiliary bishop with the right to succession who
automatically takes over when the See becomes vacant. This auxiliary cum
inre suc- cessionis has a legal title and is in control—and the other
contenders have to accept that fact and work with him.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Finally, management development and manager development are not
means to “make a man over” by changing his personality. Their aim is to
make a man effective. Their aim is to enable a man to use his strengths
fully, and to make him perform the way he is, rather than the way
somebody thinks he ought to be.</li>
</ol>
<p>An employer has no business with a man’s personality. Employment is a
specific con- tract calling for specific performance, and for nothing
else. Any attempt of an employer to go beyond this is usurpation. It is
immoral as well as illegal intrusion of privacy. It is abuse of power.
An employee owes no “loyalty,” he owes no “love” and no “attitudes”— he
owes performance and nothing else.</p>
<p>We have altogether not the slightest idea how to change the
personality of adults. We do know to some extent how to make them more
effective—and this is what we should</p>
<p>The Two Dimensions of Development</p>
<p>Development is not one, but two related tasks which mutually affect
each other. One task is that of developing management. Its purpose is
the health, survival, and growth of the enterprise. The other task is
manager development. Its purpose is the health, growth, and achievement
of the individual, both in his capacity as a member of the organization
and as a person. Management development is a function and activity of
the organization—no matter how it is being discharged. Manager
development is the responsibility of the indi- vidual, though company
and superior have an important part to play.</p>
<p>Management development starts out with the question “What kind of
managers and career professionals will this business need tomorrow in
order to achieve its objectives and to perform in a different market, a
different economy, a different technology, a differ- ent society?”</p>
<p>Management development concerns itself with questions such as the age
structure of the management group or the skills that managers need to
acquire today in order to qual- ify for tomorrow. It also focuses on the
organizational structure and the design of manage- rial jobs to satisfy
the needs, expectations, and aspirations of tomorrow’s “career cus-
tomer,” that is, tomorrow’s young manager or young career professional.
For the market for jobs and careers has become a genuine mass market.
Every organization, therefore, needs to design a “career product” that
will attract and satisfy the career customer of to- morrow.</p>
<p>The career customer will increasingly be a demanding customer. Like
the customer who, in a healthy economy, always wants more and different
goods and services for his money, the career customer, in a healthy
society, always wants something better and dif- ferent from the job.
Where only a few short decades ago he expected a living, he now looks
for a career and for an opportunity to make a contribution. At the same
time, he looks increasingly for a chance to put knowledge to work.</p>
<p>Whether management development requires a separate staff depends on
the size and complexity of the business. It is certainly not an activity
that should require a great many people and run a great many programs.
But it does need power and prestige, for its object is to change the
basic planning of the company, the structure of its organization, and
the design of managerial jobs.</p>
<p>Management development is outside-focused rather than inside-focused.
It is, essen- tially, a form of lesson planning rather than a personnel
activity. At the core of the task are planning the market, designing the
product, and obsoleting existing jobs and existing organizational
structures. Management development, seen this way, is an innovator, a
disorganizer, a critic. Its function is to ask with respect to the
company’s human organiza- tion, “What is our business and what should it
be?”</p>
<p>The development of a manager focuses on the person. Its aim is to
enable a man to develop his abilities and strengths to the fullest
extent and to find individual achievement. The aim is excellence.</p>
<p>No one can motivate a man toward self-development. Motivation must
come from within. But a man’s superior and the company can do a good
deal to discourage even the most highly motivated man and to misdirect
his development efforts. The active participa- tion, the encouragement,
the guidance from both superior and company are needed for
manager-development efforts to be fully productive.</p>
<p>The starting point for any manager-development effort is a
performance appraisal fo- cused on what a man does well, what he can do
well, and what limitations to his perform- ance capacity he needs to
overcome to get the most out of his strengths. Such an ap- praisal,
however, should always be a joint effort. It requires work on the part
of the man himself; it has to be self-appraisal. But it also requires
active leadership by a man’s man- ager.</p>
<p>In appraising themselves people tend either to be too critical or not
critical enough.</p>
<p>They are likely to see their strengths in the wrong places and to
pride themselves on non- abilities rather than on abilities.</p>
<p>There is, typically, the first-class engineer who judges himself to
be a good manager because he is “analytical” and “objective.” Yet, to be
a manager requires equally empa- thy, ability to understand how others
do their work, and a keen sense of such “non- rational” factors as
personality. There is the sales manager who considers his strengths to
lie in “strategy”—in reality he is a shrewd negotiator; and what he
means by strategy is “next week’s bargain sale.” Only too frequently
there is the good analyst and adviser who does not realize that he lacks
the emotional courage to make hard and lonely decisions.</p>
<p>An appraisal should be based on the performance objectives which a
man has set for himself in cooperation with his superior. It should
start with his performance against these objectives. It should never
start out with “potential.” It should ask “What has this man done
well—not once, but consistently?” This should lead to a recognition of
the strengths of a man and of the factors which inhibit him from making
these strengths fully effective. But a self-development appraisal should
also ask, “What do I want out of life? What are my values, my
aspirations, my directions? And what do I have to do, to learn, to
change, to make myself capable of living up to my demands on myself and
my expectations of life?” This question, too, is much better asked by an
outsider, by someone who knows the man, respects him, but at the same
time can have the insight which most of us do not pos- sess about
ourselves.</p>
<p>Self-development may require learning new skills, new knowledge, and
new manners.</p>
<p>But above all, it requires new experience. The most important factors
in self- development, apart from insight into one’s own strengths, are
experience on the job and the example of the superior. Self-appraisal,
therefore, should always lead to conclusions regarding the needs and
opportunities of a man, both with respect to what he himself has to
contribute and with respect to the experiences he needs. The question
should always be asked, “What are the right job experiences for this man
so that his strengths can develop the fastest and the furthest?”</p>
<p>A superior who works on his own development sets an almost
irresistible example.</p>
<p>His example encourages people to develop their strengths and helps
them gain the experi- ences they need. The boss who discourages, who
always knows what people cannot do, and who hangs on to them, rather
than helping them get the job experiences most condu- cive to their
growth, stunts self-development.</p>
<p>Development is always self-development. For the enterprise to assume
responsibility for the development of a man is idle boast. The
responsibility rests with the individual, his abilities, his efforts. No
business enterprise is competent, let alone obligated, to substitute its
efforts for the self-development efforts of the individual. To do this
would not only be unwarranted paternalism, it would be foolish
pretension.</p>
<p>But every manager in a business has the opportunity to encourage
individual self- development or to stifle it, to direct it or to
misdirect it. He should be specifically as- signed the responsibility
for helping all men working with him to focus, direct, and apply
self-development efforts. And every company can make available to its
managers devel- opment challenges and development experiences.</p>
<p>It is no longer necessary to debate whether management development
and manager development are luxuries in which only big companies can
indulge in boom times. Most large—and many small—companies know that the
development of management and man- agers is no more of a luxury than is
a research laboratory. It is not even necessary any longer to combat the
old fear that a company may develop too many good people. Man- agements
should have learned by now that the demand for good people is increasing
faster than the capacity of even a successful development program to
supply them. (The smart ones have, of course, always known that it has
never done a company harm to be known as “the mother of presidents.” On
the contrary, the power of a company to attract good men is directly
proportionate to its reputation as a developer of successful men for
itself as well as for other companies.) The development of management
and managers has become a necessity because the modern business
enterprise has become a basic institution of our society. In any major
institution—the Church, for instance, or the Army—finding, developing
and proving out the leaders of tomorrow is an essential job to which the
best men give fully of, their time and attention.</p>
<p>It is a necessity for the spirit, the vision, and the performance of
today’s managers that they be expected to develop those who will manage
tomorrow. Just as no one learns as much about a subject as the man who
is forced to teach it, no one develops as much as the man who is trying
to help others to develop themselves. Indeed, no one can develop him-
self unless he works on the development of others. It is in and through
efforts to develop others that managers raise their demands on
themselves. The best performers in any pro- fession always look upon the
men they have trained and developed as the proudest monument they can
leave behind.</p>
<p>And again, developing both management and managers is as needed—and
requires the same approaches—in the public-service institution as in
business enterprise.</p>
<p>But above all, today’s manager and career professional has a
responsibility to develop himself. It is a responsibility he has toward
his institution as well as toward himself.</p>
<p>We hear a great deal today about the organization man and about
alienation of people in organizations. I doubt whether there is more
conformity in today’s organization than there was in yesterday’s small
village with its tremendous pressures of class and kin, of caste and
custom. I doubt seriously whether there is more alienation today, than
in earlier societies. The classic diagnosis of alienation, after all,
was not derived from a study of the modern corporation but was made in a
thoroughly agrarian pre-industrial society, the Denmark in which
Kierkegaard lived and wrote in the early nineteenth century. But whether
conformity and spiritual despair are greater or lesser today than they
used to be, the one effective counterforce to both is the individual’s
commitment to self-development, the individual’s commitment to
excellence.</p>

Objectives and Self-Control</h4>
<p>The Forces of Misdirection—Workmanship: A Necessity and a
Danger—Misdirection by the Boss—Misdirection by Compensation—What Should
the Objectives Be?— Management by Drives—How Should Managers’ Objectives
Be Set and By Whom?— Self-Control Through Measurements—Does It Demand
Too Much of the Individ- ual?—A Philosophy of Management</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>ACH MEMBER OF THE ENTERPRISE contributes something different, but all
must contribute toward a common goal. Their efforts must all pull in the
same direc- tion, and their contributions must fit together to produce a
whole—without gaps, without friction, without unnecessary duplication of
effort.</p>
<p>Performance requires that each job be directed toward the objectives
of the whole or- ganization. In particular, each manager’s job must be
focused on the success of the whole. The performance that is expected of
the manager must be directed toward the perform- ance goals of the
business. His results are measured by the contribution they make to the
success of the enterprise. The manager must know and understand what the
business goals demand of him in terms of performance, and his superior
must know what contribution to demand and expect. If these requirements
are not met managers are misdirected and their efforts are wasted.</p>
<p>Management by objectives requires major effort and special
instruments. For in a business enterprise managers are not automatically
directed toward a common goal. On the contrary, organization, by its
very nature, contains four powerful factors of misdirec- tion: the
specialized work of most managers; the hierarchical structure of
management; the differences in vision and work and the resultant
insulation of various levels of man- agement; and finally, the
compensation structure of the management group. To overcome these
obstacles requires more than good intentions, sermons, and exhortations.
It requires policy and structure. It requires that management by
objectives be purposefully organized and be made the living law of the
entire management group.</p>
<p>An old story tells of three stonecutters who were asked what they
were doing. The first replied, “I am making a living.” The second kept
on hammering while he said, “I am do- ing the best job of stonecutting
in the entire country.” The third one looked up with a vi- sionary gleam
in his eyes and said, “I am building a cathedral.”</p>
<p>The third man is, of course, the true manager. The first man knows
what he wants to get out of the work and manages to do so. He is likely
to give a “fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay.” But he is not a
manager and will never be one. It is the second man who is a problem.
Workmanship is essential: in fact, an organization demoralizes if it
does not demand of its members the highest workmanship they are capable
of. But there is always a danger that the true workman, the true
professional, will believe that he is accomplish- ing something when in
effect he is just polishing stones or collecting footnotes. Work-
manship must be encouraged in the business enterprise. But it must
always be related to the needs of the whole.</p>
<p>The majority of managers and of career professionals in any business
enterprise are, like the second man, concerned with specialized work.
True, the number of functional managers should always be kept at a
minimum, and there should be the largest possible number of “general”
managers who manage an integrated business and are directly re-
sponsible for its performance and results. Even with the utmost
application of this princi- ple the great bulk of managers will work in
functional jobs, however.</p>
<p>A man’s habits as a manager, his vision and his values, are usually
formed while he does functional and specialized work. It is essential
that the functional specialist develop high standards of workmanship,
that he strive to be “the best stonecutter in the country.” For work
without high standards is dishonest; it corrupts the man himself and
those around him. Emphasis on, and drive for, workmanship produces
innovations and ad- vances in every area of management. That managers
strive to do “professional personnel management,” to run “the most
up-to-date plant,” to do “truly scientific market research,” to “put in
the most modern accounting system,” or to do “perfect engineering” must
be encouraged.</p>
<p>But this striving for professional workmanship in functional and
specialized work is also a danger. It tends to divert a man’s vision and
efforts from the goals of the business. The functional work becomes an
end in itself. In far too many instances the functional manager no
longer measures his performance by its contribution to the enterprise
but only by his own professional criteria of workmanship. He tends to
appraise his subordinates by their craftsmanship and to reward and to
promote them accordingly. He resents demands made on him for the sake of
business performance as interference with “good engineer- ing,” “smooth
production,” or “hard-hitting selling.” The functional manager’s
legitimate desire for workmanship becomes, unless counterbalanced, a
centrifugal force which tears the enterprise apart and converts it into
a loose confederation of functional empires, each concerned only with
its own craft, each jealously guarding its own “secrets,” each bent on
enlarging its own domain rather than on building the business.</p>
<p>This danger is being greatly intensified by the technological and
social changes now under way. The number of highly educated specialists
working in the business enterprise is increasing tremendously. And so
will the level of workmanship demanded of these spe- cialists. Our work
force is increasingly becoming an “educated” work force in which the
majority make their contribution in the form of specialized knowledge.
The tendency to make the craft or function an end in itself will
therefore become even more marked than it is today. But at the same time
the new technology will demand much closer coordination between
specialists. It will demand that functional men, even at the lowest
management level, see the business as a whole and understand what it
requires of them. The new tech- nology will need both the drive for
excellence in workmanship and the consistent direc- tion of managers at
all levels toward the common goal.</p>
<p>That university teachers no longer see the university as their “home”
but rather give allegiance to their specialization is considered an
important reason for the crisis of the university. But exactly the same
tendency exists in all other institutions, business enter- prise
included.</p>
<p>Misdirection by the Boss</p>
<p>The hierarchical structure of management aggravates the danger. What
the boss does and says, his most casual remarks, his habits, even his
mannerisms, tend to appear to his sub- ordinates as calculated, planned,
and meaningful. “All you ever hear around the place is human-relations
talk; but when the boss calls you on the carpet it is always because
over- time is too high; and when it comes to promoting a guy, the plums
always go to those who do the best job filling out accounting-department
forms.” This is one of the most common tunes, sung with infinite
variations on every level of management. It leads to poor per-
formance—even in cutting overtime. It also expresses loss of confidence
in, and absence of respect for, the company and its management.</p>
<p>Yet the manager who so misdirects his subordinates does not intend to
do so. He genuinely considers human relations to be the most important
task of his plant managers. But he talks about overtime because he feels
that he has to establish himself with his men as a “practical man,” or
because he thinks that he shows familiarity with their problems by
talking “shop” with them. He stresses the accounting-department forms
only because they annoy him as much as they do his men—or he may just
not want to have any more trouble with the comptroller than he can help.
But to his subordinates these reasons are hidden; all they see and hear
is the question about overtime, the emphasis on forms.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem requires a structure of management which
focuses both the manager’s and his boss’s eyes on what the job—rather
than the boss—demands. To stress styles and manners—as does a good deal
of current management literature—is likely instead to aggravate the
problem. Indeed, everyone familiar with business today has seen
situations in which a manager’s attempt to avoid misdirection through
changing his manners has converted a fairly satisfactory relationship
into a nightmare of embarrass- ment and misunderstanding. The manager
himself becomes so self-conscious as to lose all easy relationship with
his men. And the men in turn react with: “So help us, the old man has
read a book; we used to know what he wanted of us, now we have to
guess.”</p>
<p>Differences in Levels of Management</p>
<p>Misdirection can result from difference in concern and function
between various levels of management. This problem, too, cannot be
solved by attitudes and good intentions; for it is rooted in the
structure of any enterprise. Nor can it be solved by “better communica-
tions,” for communications presuppose common understanding and a common
language, and it is precisely that which is usually lacking.</p>
<p>It is no accident that the old story of the blind men meeting up with
an elephant on the road is so popular among management people. Each
level of management sees the same “elephant”—the business—from a
different angle of vision. The production foreman, like the blind man
who felt the elephant’s leg and decided that a tree was in his way,
tends to see only the immediate production problems. Top management—the
blind man touching the trunk and deciding a snake bars his way—tends to
see only the enterprise as a whole; it sees stockholders, financial
problems, altogether a host of highly abstract relations and figures.
Operating management—the blind man feeling the elephant’s belly and
thinking himself up against a landslide—tends to see things
functionally. Each level needs its par- ticular vision; it could not do
its job without it. Yet, these visions are so different that people on
different levels talking about the same thing often do not realize
it—or, as fre- quently happens, believe that they are talking about the
same thing when in reality they are poles apart.</p>
<p>Misdirection by Compensation</p>
<p>The most serious force for misdirection within the management group
may be the com- pensation structure. At the same time, it is the most
refractory one. Somehow management people have to be paid, but every
compensation system is liable to misdirect.</p>
<p>Compensation is cost to the enterprise, and income to the recipient.
But it also always expresses status, both within the enterprise and in
society. It entails judgments on a man’s worth as much as on his
performances. It is emotionally tied to all our ideas of fairness,
justice, and equity. Money is, of course, quantitative. But the money in
any compensation system expresses the most intangible, but also the most
sensitive, values and qualities. For this reason, there can be no truly
simple or truly rational compensation system.</p>
<p>In Japan compensation, at least up to the time a manager reaches age
forty-five, is based on one factor alone: seniority. But this too tends
to misdirect, especially the younger men, into pleasing their superiors
rather than toward achieving results. The fact that immediate
compensation is not affected by performance only makes more important
the deferred judgment, that is, the decision whether a given executive,
at age forty-five, should be promoted into top management or should be
kept a middle manager and retired</p>
<p>ten years later. This, of course, does not affect the man who, early
in his career, decides that he is not going to make it anyhow or that it
is not worth the effort. But the ambitious, high performer—the very man
who should be motivated properly—is bound to be seri- ously misdirected
by the Japanese system. Acceptance by a clique rather than perform- ance
is likely to be his objective.</p>
<p>Any compensation system determines a man’s place within the group.
How his pay re- lates to the pay of others, and especially to the pay of
the men he considers his peers, is always more important than the
absolute amount of his salary. (On this see Chapters 15 and 18.)
Compensation must always try to balance recognition of the individual
with sta- bility and maintenance of the group. No attempt at a
“scientific formula” for compensa- tion can therefore be completely
successful. The best possible compensation plan is of necessity a
compromise among the various functions and meanings of compensation, for
the individual as well as for the groups. Even the best plan will still
disorganize as well as organize, misdirect as well as direct, and
encourage the wrong as well as the right behav- ior.</p>
<p>Yet, there is hardly a more powerful signal for managers than
compensation and com- pensation structure. Its importance to them goes
far beyond the economic meaning of money. It conveys to them the values
of their top management and their own worth within the management group.
It expresses in clear and tangible form a man’s position, rank, and
recognition within the group. At today’s high tax rates a little more
money means, as a rule, very little to senior men. It is, in effect,
only so much more income tax to pay. But the status symbol of a little
more money and its emotional impacts are incalculable.</p>
<p>The most damaging misdirection may result from those apparently
eminently “fair”</p>
<p>compensation systems for the heads of decentralized divisions and
businesses which re- late a manager’s pay directly to performance,
usually to performance measured by return on investment during the
calendar year. If we want to measure performance, there is no other way.
The man himself and his associates, that is, the people in charge of a
decentral- ized business within a company, measure themselves by their
annual profit or loss. In fact, to have them do so is one of the major
reasons for decentralization. Yet, if return on in- vestment or current
profits are overemphasized, the managers of decentralized business will
be misdirected toward slighting the future.</p>
<p>An able management team heading one of the major divisions of a
chemical company failed for years to develop a badly needed new product.
Year after year they reported to their top management that the new
product was not yet quite ready. Finally, when the di- vision manager
was asked bluntly why he stalled on a project that was clearly vital to
the success of his business, he answered: “Have you looked at our
compensation plan? I my- self have a guaranteed salary. But my entire
management group gets its main income from a bonus geared to return on
investment. The new product is the future of this business. But for five
or eight years there will be only investment and no return. I know we
are three years late. But do you really expect me to take the bread out
of the mouths of my closest associates?” This story had a happy ending.
The compensation plan was changed—somewhat in line with the plan Du Pont
has had for years with respect to new developments. Du Pont does not put
the cost of a development into the investment base of a division or a
subsidiary until the new product has been introduced on the market. And
within a year or two the new product was out and selling.</p>
<p>The danger is beginning to be widely recognized. General Electric
Company, for in- stance, several years ago scrapped its compensation
system, based on the return on in- vestment of a division, and replaced
it by one in which return on investment is only one factor in the
compensation of divisional executives. Other factors that reflect
provisions for the future are also included in determining divisional
bonuses. This works quite a bit better. Still, nobody at GE considers
the new system to be perfect, if only because of its complexity.</p>
<p>The preference should be for simple compensation systems rather than
for complex ones. It should be for compensation systems that allow
judgment to be used and that en- able pay to be fitted to the job of the
individual rather than impose one formula on every-</p>
<p>body. But I would be the last person to claim that a “fair” let alone
a “scientific” system can be devised. All one can do, to repeat, is to
watch lest the compensation system reward the wrong behavior, emphasize
the wrong results, and direct people away from perform- ance for the
common good.</p>
<p>What Should the Objectives of a Manager Be?</p>
<p>Constant effort alone can counteract the inherent tendencies toward
diffusion and misdi- rection. The superior needs to understand what he
expects of his subordinate managers. The subordinate, in turn, needs to
be able to know what in the way of results he should hold himself
accountable for. Without special efforts, superior or subordinate will
not know and understand this and their ideas will not be compatible, let
alone identical.</p>
<p>Each manager, from the “big boss” down to the production foreman or
the chief clerk, needs clearly spelled-out objectives. Otherwise
confusion can be guaranteed. These ob- jectives should lay out what
performance the man’s own managerial unit is supposed to achieve. They
should lay out what contribution he and his unit are expected to make to
help other units obtain their objectives. Finally, they should spell out
what contribution the manager can expect from other units toward the
attainment of his own objectives. Right from the start, in other words,
emphasis should be on teamwork and team results.</p>
<p>These objectives should always derive from the goals of the business
enterprise. A statement of his own objectives based on those of the
company and of the manufacturing department should be demanded even of
the foreman on the assembly line. The company may be so large as to make
the distance between the individual foreman’s production and the
company’s total output all but astronomical. Yet the foreman must focus
on the objec- tives and goals of the company and needs to define his
results in terms of his unit’s con- tribution to the whole of which it
is a part.</p>
<p>The objectives of every manager should spell out his contribution to
the attainment of company goals in all areas of the business. Obviously,
not every manager has a direct contribution to make in every area. The
contribution which marketing makes to productiv- ity, for example, may
be indirect and hard to define. But if a manager and his unit are not
expected to contribute toward any one of the areas that significantly
affect prosperity and survival of the business, this fact should be
clearly brought out. For managers must under- stand that business
results depend on a balance of efforts and results in a number of areas.
This is necessary both to give full scope to the craftsmanship of each
function and spe- cialty, and to prevent the empire-building and
clannish jealousies of the various functions and specialties. It is
necessary also to avoid overemphasis on any one key area.</p>
<p>This is particularly important for service staffs and for such highly
specialized groups as the computer people. They may not always be able
to relate their work directly to busi- ness objectives and business
results. But unless they make the effort, they are likely to direct
their work away from business objectives and business results.</p>
<p>To obtain balanced efforts the objectives of all managers on all
levels and in all areas should also be keyed to both short-range and
long-range considerations. And, of course, all objectives should always
contain both the tangible business objectives and such “in- tangible”
objectives as manager organization and development, worker performance
and attitude, and public responsibility. Anything else is shortsighted
and impractical.</p>
<p>Management by Drives</p>
<p>Proper management requires balanced stress on objectives, especially
by top manage- ment. If avoids the all-too-common business malpractice:
management by crisis and drives.</p>
<p>That things always collapse into the status quo ante three weeks
after a drive is over, everybody knows and apparently expects. The only
result of an economy drive is likely to be that messengers and typists
get fired, and that 5,000 executives are forced to do 50-a-week work
typing their own letters—and doing it badly. And yet many manage-</p>
<p>ments fail to draw the obvious conclusion that drives are, after all,
not the way to get things done.</p>
<p>Over and above its ineffectiveness, management by drive misdirects.
It puts all em- phasis on one phase of the job to the detriment of
everything else. “For four weeks we cut inventories,” a case-hardened
veteran of management by crisis once summed it up. “Then we have four
weeks of cost-cutting, followed by four weeks of human relations. We
just have time to push customer service and courtesy for a month. And
then the inventory is back where it was when we started. We don’t even
try to do our job. All top management talks about, thinks about,
preaches about, is last week’s inventory figure or this week’s customer
complaints. How we do the rest of the job they don’t even want to
know.”</p>
<p>In an organization which manages by drives people either neglect
their job to get on with the current drive, or silently organize for
collective sabotage of the drive in order to get their work done. In
either event they become deaf to the cry of “wolf.” And when the real
crisis comes, when all hands should drop everything and pitch in, they
treat it as just another case of management-created hysteria. Management
by drive is a sure sign of con- fusion. It is an admission of
incompetence. It is a sign that management does not think. But, above
all, it is a sign that the company does not know what to expect of its
managers and that, not knowing how to direct them, it misdirects
them.</p>
<p>How Should Managers’ Objectives Be Set and by Whom?</p>
<p>The goals of each manager’s job must be defined by the contribution
he has to make to the success of the larger unit of which he is a part.
The objectives of the district sales manager’s job should be defined by
the contribution he and his district sales force have to make to the
sales department, the objectives of the project engineer’s job by the
contribu- tion he, his engineers, and draftsmen make to the engineering
department. The objectives of the general manager of a decentralized
division should be defined by the contribution his division has to make
to the objectives of the parent company.</p>
<p>Higher management must, of course, reserve the power to approve or
disapprove these objectives. But their development is part of a
manager’s responsibility; indeed, it is his first responsibility. It
means, too, that every manager should responsibly participate in the
development of the objectives of the higher unit of which his is a part.
To “give him a sense of participation” (to use a pet phrase of human
relations jargon) is not enough. It is the wrong thing. Being a manager
means having responsibility. Precisely because his aims should reflect
the objective needs of the business, rather than merely what the boss—or
he himself—wants, he must commit himself to them with a positive act of
assent. He must know and understand the ultimate business goals, what is
expected of him and why, what he will be measured against and how. There
must be a meeting of minds within the entire management of each unit.
This can be achieved only when each of the contributing man- agers is
expected to think through what the unit objectives are and is led to
participate actively and responsibly in the work of defining them. And
only if his lower managers participate in this way can the higher
manager know what to expect of them and can make exacting demands.</p>
<p>This is so important that some of the most effective managers I know
go one step fur- ther. They have each of their subordinates write a
“manager’s letter” twice a year. In this letter to his superior, each
manager first defines the objectives of his superior’s job and of his
own job as he sees them. He then sets down the performance standards
which he be- lieves are being applied to him. Next, he lists the things
he must do to attain these goals— and the things within his own unit he
considers the major obstacles. He lists the things his superior and the
company do that help him and the things that hamper him. Finally, he
outlines what he proposes to do during the next year to reach his goals.
If his superior accepts this statement, the “manager’s letter” becomes
the charter under which the man- ager operates.</p>
<p>This device, like no other I have seen, brings out how easily the
unconsidered and casual remarks of even the best boss can confuse and
misdirect. One large company has</p>
<p>used the manager’s letter for ten years. Yet almost every letter
still lists as objectives and standards things which baffle the superior
to whom the letter is addressed. And whenever he asks, “What is this?”
he gets the answer, “Don’t you remember what you said last spring going
down with me in the elevator?”</p>
<p>The manager’s letter also brings out whatever inconsistencies there
are in the demands made on a man by his superior and by the company.
Does the superior demand both speed and high quality when he can get
only one or the other? And what compromise is needed in the interest of
the company? Does he demand initiative and judgment of his men but also
that they check back with him before they do anything? Does he ask for
their ideas and suggestions but never use them or discuss them? Does the
company expect of a small engineering force that it be available
immediately whenever something goes wrong in the plant and yet bend all
its efforts to the completion of new designs? Does it expect a man- ager
to maintain high standards of performance but forbid him to remove poor
perform- ers? Does it create the conditions under which people say, “I
can get the work done as long as I can keep the boss from knowing what I
am doing”?</p>
<p>These are common situations. They undermine spirit and performance.
The manager’s letter may not prevent them, but at least it brings them
out in the open, shows where com- promises have to be made, objectives
have to be thought through, priorities have to be established, behavior
has to be changed.</p>
<p>As this device illustrates, managing managers requires special
efforts not only to es- tablish common direction, but to eliminate
misdirection. Mutual understanding can never be attained by
“communications down,” can never be created by talking. It can result
only from “communications up.” It requires both the superior’s
willingness to listen and a tool especially designed to make lower
managers heard.</p>
<p>Self-Control through Measurements</p>
<p>The greatest advantage of management by objectives is perhaps that it
makes it possible for a manager to control his own performance.
Self-control means stronger motivation: a desire to do the best rather
than do just enough to get by: It means higher performance goals and
broader vision. Even if management by objectives were not necessary to
give the enterprise the unity of direction and effort of a management
team, it would be neces- sary to make possible management by
self-control.</p>
<p>So far in this book I have rarely talked of control; I have talked of
measurement. This was intentional. For control is an ambiguous word. It
means the ability to direct oneself and one’s work. It can also mean
domination of one person by another. Objectives are the basis of control
in the first sense; but they must never become the basis of control in
the second, for this would defeat their purpose. Indeed, one of the
major contributions of management by objectives is that it enables us to
substitute management by self-control for management by domination.</p>
<p>To be able to control his own performance a manager needs to know
more than what his goals are. He must be able to measure his performance
and results against the goal. It should be an invariable practice to
supply managers with clear and common measure- ments in all key areas of
a business. These measurements need not be rigidly quantitative; nor
need they be exact. But they have to be clear, simple, and rational.
They have to be relevant and direct attention and efforts where they
should go. They have to be reliable— at least to the point where their
margin of error is acknowledged and understood. And they have to be, so
to speak, self-explanatory, understandable without complicated inter-
pretation or philosophical discussion.</p>
<p>Each manager should have the information he needs to measure his own
performance and should receive it soon enough to make any changes
necessary for the desired results. And this information should go to the
manager himself, and not to his superior. It should be the means of
self-control, not a tool of control from above.</p>
<p>This needs particular stress today, when the ability to obtain such
information is grow- ing rapidly as a result of technological progress
in information gathering, analysis, and</p>
<p>synthesis. In the past, information on important facts was either not
obtainable at all or could be assembled only so late as to be of little
but historical interest. This was not an unmixed curse. It made
effective self-control difficult; but it also made difficult domina-
tion of a manager from above; in the absence of information with which
to control him, the manager had to be allowed to work as he saw fit.</p>
<p>The new ability to produce measuring information will make possible
effective self- control; and if so used, it will lead to a tremendous
advance in the effectiveness and per- formance of management. But if
this new ability is abused to impose control on managers from above, the
new technology will inflict incalculable harm by demoralizing manage-
ment and by seriously lowering the effectiveness of managers.</p>
<p>Self-Control and Performance Standards</p>
<p>Management by objectives and self-control asks for self-discipline.
It forces the manager to make high demands on himself. It is anything
but permissive. It may well lead to de- manding too much rather than too
little. This has indeed been the main criticism leveled against the
concept. (See Chapter 19, especially the discussion of Maslow’s
criticism of Theory Y.)</p>
<p>Management by objectives and self-control assumes that people want to
be responsi- ble, want to contribute, want to achieve, and that is a
bold assumption. Yet we know that people largely act as they are
expected, to act.</p>
<p>A manager who starts out with the assumption that people are weak,
irresponsible, and lazy will get weakness, irresponsibility, and
laziness. He corrupts. A manager who as- sumes strength, responsibility,
and desire to contribute may experience a few disappoint- ments. But the
manager’s first task is to make effective the strengths of people, and
this he can do only if he starts out with the assumption that people—and
especially managers and professional contributors—want to achieve.</p>
<p>Above all, he must make this assumption with regard to the young
educated people of today who will be tomorrow’s managers. They may not
know what they mean when they demand to be allowed to “make a
contribution.” But their demand is the right demand.</p>
<p>And they are right also that management, as it has been practiced so
far in all institutions including business, does not act on the
assumption that the young educated people want to</p>
<p>make a contribution. They need to be subjected—and to subject
themselves—to the disci- pline and the demands of management by
objectives and self-control.</p>
<p>In the years since I first coined the term,* “management by
objectives” has become a widely used slogan. There is a whole
literature, and any number of management courses, seminars, and even
movies, on the subject. Hundreds of companies have adopted a policy of
management by objectives—though only a few have followed through with
true self- control. But management by objectives and self-control is
more than a slogan, more than a technique, more than a policy even. It
is, so to speak, a constitutional principle.</p>
<p>A Philosophy of Management</p>
<p>What the business enterprise needs is a principle of management that
will give full scope to individual strength and responsibility, as well
as common direction to vision and effort, establish team work, and
harmonize the goals of the individual with the commonwealth. Management
by objectives and self-control makes the commonwealth the aim of every
manager. It substitutes for control from outside the stricter, more
exacting, and more ef- fective control from inside. It motivates the
manager to action, not because somebody tells him to do something or
talks him into doing it, but because the objective task de- mands it. He
acts not because somebody wants him to but because he himself decides
that he has to-he acts, in other words, as a free man.</p>
<p>I do not use the word “philosophy,” lightly; indeed I prefer not to
use it at all; it’s much too big a word. But management by objectives
and self-control may properly be</p>
<p>*In Practice of Management.</p>
<p>called a philosophy of management. It rests on a concept of the job
of management. It rests on an analysis of the specific needs of the
management group and the obstacles it faces. It rests on a concept of
human action, behavior, and motivation. Finally, it applies to every
manager, whatever his level and function, and to any organization
whether large or small. It insures performance by converting objective
needs into personal goals. And this is genuine freedom.</p>

<p>and automation were the headline makers, the was widely predicted. By
1980, we were told</p>
<p>by a number of experts, middle management would have disappeared. All
decisions would be made by the computer or by top management on the
basis of a “total informa- tion system.”</p>
<p>Very few predictions have been disproved so fast and so completely.
At the very time the predictions were being widely publicized, the
middle-management boom began. And it kept going for twenty years.
Indeed, the fifties and the sixties might have been called the era of
middle management. No other group in the work force, in all developed
coun- tries, has been growing as fast.</p>
<p>There was, indeed, during this period, a powerful force at work
reducing the number of middle-management jobs. It was not, however, the
computer, automation, or any other new technology. It was the press of
mergers, takeovers, and acquisitions, especially in the U.S. and in
Great Britain. It resulted in consolidating or closing countless sales
and ac- counting offices—and with it the abolition of middle-management
positions by the score. Yet despite this force—which reached hurricane
strength in the late sixties in the English- speaking world—the demand
for middle-rank managerial people grew steadily except in periods of
economic recession as in Great Britain in the late sixties and in the
U.S. in 1970-71. And in companies not directly affected by mergers or
acquisitions, or in public- service institutions, the demand grew
spectacularly.</p>
<p>Here are some examples from manufacturing, that is, from the economic
sector where automation has been most widely applied and where computers
have become as common- place, at least in big companies, as smokestacks
were a few generations ago. One of the large American automobile
companies recently built a major manufacturing plant to turn out the
entire production of a new model. It was the company’s first major
automotive plant since 1949, when a similar plant, designed for a
similar production volume, was opened. The number of rank-and-file
employees, both blue-collar and clerical, is almost</p>
<p>one-third less than that of the earlier plant—the result, however, of
normal increases in productivity rather than of a shift of the process
to automation. The top-management group in the new plant is about the
same size. But the middle-management group, that is, the group that is
paid more than a general foreman and less than the plant’s general man-
ager, is almost five times the size of the middle-management group in
the 1949 plant.</p>
<p>Another manufacturing company—a producer of a wide range of
industrial compo- nents—grew between 1950 and 1970 from a sales volume
of 0 million to one of 00 million. In terms of units the growth was
fivefold. During this period of rapid expansion, the top-management
group grew from three men to five. Rank-and-file employment grew from
l,000 to 4,000. The middle-management ranks, again defined by salary,
grew from 14 men to 235—that is, almost seventeen times—and this does
not include salesmen.</p>
<p>Here is an example from England: One of the large materials
companies—a world- wide leader in its industry—grew by 45 percent
between 1950 and 1970, measured in volume of output and discounting for
inflation and price increases. The top-management group at the end of
the period was actually somewhat smaller as the result of two reor-
ganizations in which older members of the founding families were being
replaced by pro- fessional managers. The rank and file, both in the
factories and in the office, grew by about a fifth. But the middle group
tripled.</p>
<p>The same rapid expansion in the middle ranks has occurred in Japan.
Middle man- agement in Japan is synonymous with “university graduates on
the payroll.” And that number in Japan—and especially the number of
university graduates working for busi- ness—has increased even faster
than the Japanese economy. Indeed, the words “salary man,” the Japanese
term for the middle group, has become a slogan.</p>
<p>These examples actually understate the growth rate of middle
management. During the period in which middle management was expected to
disappear, the center of economic gravity and growth shifted to
industries that have a much higher ratio of middle managers in their
employ than have the industries which dominated the business scene in
1950. The symbol of economic dynamism in the United States economy of
1970 was no longer Gen- eral Motors. It was IBM. And at IBM, or at any
other computer manufacturer, the middle group is far bigger than in
traditional manufacturing industries such as automobile or steel. The
same is true of the pharmaceutical companies which grew so rapidly in
the twenty years between 1950 and 1970.</p>
<p>Outside of manufacturing industries the growth has been even more
rapid. It has been particularly pronounced in the non-business service
institutions. The prototype is the hos- pital.</p>
<p>Top management in the hospital—however one defines it—has not grown.
There is still the hospital administrator, perhaps with an assistant in
the larger hospital. There are in the community hospitals, the trustees,
and there is a medical director. Rank-and-file employment in terms of
number of employees per patient day has gone down rather than up. It is
in the kitchen, in maintenance, and in the other rank-and-file areas
that hospitals have become somewhat less labor-intensive. But the middle
ranks—technicians, engi- neers, accountants, psychologists and social
workers—have exploded. They have grown at least fourfold—in some big
teaching hospitals even faster.</p>
<p>The Needed Correction</p>
<p>Growth at such rates always overshoots the target. It is bound to be
disorderly and waste- ful. There is overstaffing because it is the
fashion to go in for this or that activity whether needed or not. There
is overstaffing because times are good and it is easier to accede to a
demand for more people than to fight it. And in such a period of
explosive growth no one pays much attention to the organization of the
work. Yet expansion of such magnitude is always qualitative change
rather than more additional quantity. If the work and its organi- zation
are not studied and changed, waste, duplication of effort, and
organizational obe- sity follow.</p>
<p>Examples of wasteful overstaffing in the middle ranks abound. The
worst are some American defense projects. To design the Mirage fighter,
the best military plane of the 1954-1970 period, the French employed
some seventy engineers and designers who did the job in record time. A
comparable American development might have been staffed with three
thousand engineers and designers and have taken four times as long and,
in the end, might have come out with an inferior design at infinitely
greater cost.</p>
<p>But there are examples of blatant overstaffing in private industry
too. It is quite unlikely that IBM, on its rapid expansion, could have
put to productive work all the masses of middle-management people it
hired, on the basis of their college diplomas as a rule rather than for
proven performance or because the need for their services had been
clearly established.</p>
<p>The middle-management boom therefore had to lead, like any other
boom, to a “mid- dle-management depression.” At the first significant
economic setback there had to be a sharp correction. This came first in
Great Britain, where the fairly sharp recession of the late sixties
coincided with a peak in mergers and takeovers, resulting in layoffs of
middle- rank executives and professionals. In the United States, in the
1970/71 recession, the reac- tion was far milder: it consisted of a
sharp two-year curtailment of college recruiting for management and
professional positions with very few layoffs of middle-management people
already on the payroll (except in the particularly distressed aerospace
and defense industries). And Japan, when scared by President Nixon’s
trade and economic offensive in 1971, also reacted by curtailing
temporarily new hiring.</p>
<p>Such a reaction, however painful, is fundamentally healthy. It always
goes too far, of course. But at least it forces management to think
through what the work is and what it needs. Such thinking is
particularly important with respect to middle-management work. There are
few areas where overstaffing does as much damage as in the middle-
management group. It costs a great deal more than money. It costs
performance and moti- vation.</p>
<p>The Danger of Overstaffing</p>
<p>Knowledge work—that is, the specific work of middle managers—should
always be de- manding. It should be lean, and err, if at all, on the
side of understaffing. An overstaffed middle-management organization
destroys motivation. It destroys accomplishment, achievement, and
satisfaction. In the end, it destroys performance.*</p>
<p>The middle-management boom and the resulting overstaffing, especially
in larger companies, did indeed undermine morale and motivation.
Overstaffing is a main reason for the dissatisfaction and disenchantment
of so many of the young middle-rank people, managers and career
professionals, whom business, governments, school systems, and hospitals
recruited in such large numbers during the fifties and sixties. They are
well paid and well treated; but there is not enough for them to do, not
enough challenge, not enough contribution, not enough accomplishment,
and too much sheer busyness. There are too many bodies busily
“interacting” with each other rather than doing their own work. When the
able young educated people, e.g., the brightest graduates of the leading
American business schools, are asked to explain their growing preference
for a job in a small com- pany or in the medium-sized city
administration, they always say, “At least I’ll have something to
do.”</p>
<p>The first lesson is to keep the middle ranks lean. “What really needs
to be done?” is the first question. And the second and equally important
one is “What no longer needs to be done and should be cut back or cut
out?” The first lesson is the need for weight con- trol.</p>
<p>In particular this means that a new middle-management activity
should, as a rule, be sanctioned only if an old one is sloughed off or,
at least, pruned back. The middle- management budget is predominately an
“administered expense” (see Chapter 9) and</p>
<p>*On this see especially the two books by Frederick Herzberg: Work and
the Nature of Man (World Publishing Co., 1966) and The Motivation to
Work (Wiley, 1959).</p>
<p>needs to be constantly watched to make sure that good, performing
people are allocated to opportunities, to results, and to making the
future rather than wasted on problems, busy- ness, and on defending the
past.</p>
<p>What needs even more thought and attention is, however, the work of
middle man- agement and its organization. The expansion of the middle
ranks not only produced a qualitative change—it was itself produced by a
change in the nature of the middle- management function.</p>
<p>Middle management will, it is safe to predict, continue to expand.
But future growth will have to be directed, controlled, managed. It will
have to be based on an understand- ing of the changing nature of middle
management and of the resulting need for change in function,
relationship, and structure.</p>
<p>Where the Growth Occurred</p>
<p>The middle management of forty years ago has not disappeared. Rather
it has grown, and quite substantially. There are today proportionately
more plant managers around, more district sales managers, and more
branch managers in banks than there were before World War II.</p>
<p>But the real growth of middle-rank people in management jobs has been
in manufac- turing engineers and process specialists; in tax accountants
and market analysts; in prod- uct and market managers; in advertising
and promotion specialists. It has been in a host of functions which, a
generation ago, were hardly known. The new middle managers are the
knowledge professionals (see Chapter 30).</p>
<p>The traditional middle, manager is essentially a commander of men.
The new middle manager is essentially a supplier of knowledge. The
traditional middle manager has au- thority downward, over the people who
report to him. The new middle manager essen- tially has responsibility
sideways and upward, that is, to people over whom he exercises no
command authority.</p>
<p>Above all, the traditional middle manager’s job is largely routine.
He did not make decisions. He carried them out. At the most, he
implemented them and adapted them to local conditions. His job was to
keep running a system that he had neither designed nor was expected to
alter.</p>
<p>This underlay, of course, the traditional definition of a manager as
someone who is re- sponsible for the work of others rather than
responsible for his own work. It also underlay the traditional social
structure of management outside the U.S. and Japan, especially in
Europe.</p>
<p>In the United States and Japan top management has traditionally been
recruited from middle management, that is, from people who worked their
way up in the business. In European countries this was not the pattern.
In England there was—and to some extent still is—a tremendous gulf
between managers and “the board,” that is, top management. Even in large
companies the board was until recently recruited from people who had
never discharged operating management functions, if not from people who
had never worked in a business; such as distinguished former public
servants. In Holland top man- agement, even in the large and
professionally managed companies, rarely comes out of operations. In the
large French company all positions in top and senior management are
typically held by graduates of the Grandes Écoles. Most of them,
especially top- management people, make their careers in government and
then move directly into senior management jobs in business. Operating
managers who come up in the business are nor- mally considered unfit for
top jobs, even if they are university graduates. The Germans tend to
draw a sharp line between Führung, i.e., top management, and Leitung,
operating management.*</p>
<p>*The semantic hurdle the word “management” has faced outside of the
United Stata is a result. In most Euro- pean languages—and thirty years
ago even in British English—there is no one term comprising the totality
of the management group. There are separate terms for the people at the
top and for the people in the middle. And since “management” is usually
being translated into these languages with the word that connotes the
operating,</p>
<p>Georg Siemens, the founder of the Deutsche Bank (see Chapter 29 and
especially Chapter 49), became the head of a major financial institution
as a young government law- yer barely thirty, without experience in the
banking business. His youth was exceptional; his lack of business
preparation and operating knowledge was not.</p>
<p>That this social structure could work—and work very well in many
cases—shows that the European view of the traditional middle manager as
being concerned with routines rather than with decisions, and with
maintenance of going operations rather than with direction, had a good
deal of substance.</p>
<p>The Decision Impact of the New Middle Manager</p>
<p>But as the new middle people are knowledge professional, their
actions and decisions are intended to have direct and major impact on
the business, its ability to perform, and its direction.</p>
<p>Here are some fairly typical examples.</p>
<p>The product manager in companies such as Procter andandandand
Gamble’s soap and detergent business, in Unilever’s food business, or in
the radio and TV business of Philips of Hol- land, is definitely middle
management by rank and compensation. He has no command authority. The
work is being carried out by people who report to their respective func-
tional bosses, the manufacturing manager, the sales manager, the head of
the chemical and development laboratories, and so on. But he is held
responsible for the development, the introduction, and the performance
of a product in the marketplace. He decides very largely whether a new
product should indeed be developed. He decides what its specifica- tions
should be. He determines its price. He decides where and how to
test-market it. And he decides the sales goals. He does not have any
direct command authority and cannot issue an order. But he controls
directly a major determinant of performance and success for a branded
consumer product, the advertising and promotion budget.</p>
<p>The quality control engineer in a machine tool company also has no
command author- ity and has no one, except junior quality engineers,
reporting to him. But he decides the design and structure of the
manufacturing process. His quality control standards largely decide the
costs of the manufacturing process and the performance of the
manufacturing plant. The manufacturing manager or the plant manager does
indeed make the decisions. But the quality control man can veto
them.</p>
<p>The tax accountant also has no command, can give no orders, and often
has no one re- porting to him except his secretary. Yet, in effect, he
has a veto power over even top- management decisions. His opinion on the
tax consequences of a course of action often determines both what a
company can do and how it must do it.</p>
<p>The industry specialist in a large commercial bank, e.g., the man who
is the expert on retail trade, is not supposed to make loans on his own
authority. But the lending officers, in turn, are not supposed to make
loans to a retail chain without his approval. And when a retail store
customer of the bank gets into difficulties, it is the retail specialist
who takes over. The retail specialist in the bank is also expected to
determine on his own responsi- bility and based on his own knowledge
whether the bank should, at any given time, ex- pand or contract its
lending to retail stores. He is expected to determine what the criteria
for loans to retail stores should be. And if he sees a loan to a retail
chain which, to him, seems dubious, he is not expected to go “upstairs.”
He picks up the telephone and calls the lending officer in charge of the
account. He cannot “order” the lending officer to call the loan or to
cut it back. Still, the lending officer, who may well outrank the
retail-trade specialist will not say, “I was advised by the specialist
to cut back this loan.” He will say, “I was told by the specialist.”</p>
<p>The product manager at Procter andandandand Gamble, the quality
engineer, and the tax account- ant are not “line” managers. But neither
are they “staff.” Their function is not advice and</p>
<p>middle-management people, the people at the top, such as the German
Unternehmer, tended to conclude that management was concerned with
routine operations rather than with crucial decisions and that,
therefore, man- agement was for “them” and not for “us.”</p>
<p>teaching. They do “operating” work. Yet they have top-management
impacts even though they are not top management in rank, compensation,
or function.</p>
<p>To be sure, they cannot make some of the key decisions—what our
business is and what it should be; what its objectives are; what the
priorities are and should be; where to allocate key resources of capital
and people. But even with respect to these decisions they contribute the
essential knowledge without which the key decision cannot be made, at
least not effectively. And the key decisions cannot become effective
unless these new middle managers build them into their own knowledge and
work on their own responsibil- ity and on their own authority. In an
earlier chapter (Chapter 30) it was argued that the knowledge
professional is a manager even though no one reports to him. Now we see
that in his impacts and responsibilities he is top management even
though he may be five or six organizational levels down.</p>
<p>The Knowledge Organization</p>
<p>Middle management has not disappeared, as was predicted. Indeed not
even the tradi- tional middle manager has disappeared. But yesterday’s
middle management is being transformed into tomorrow’s knowledge
organization.</p>
<p>This requires restructuring individual jobs, but also restructuring
the organization and its design. In the knowledge organization the job,
all the way down to the lowest profes- sional or managerial level, has
to focus on the company’s objectives. It has to focus on contribution,
which means that it has to have its own objectives. It has to be
organized according to assignment. It has to be thought through and
structured according to the flow of information both to and from the
individual position. And it has to be placed into the decision
structure. It can no longer be designed; as was the traditional middle-
management job, in terms of downward authority alone. It has to be
recognized instead as multidimensional.</p>
<p>Traditionally, middle-management jobs have been designed narrowly.
The first con- cern has been with the limits on a middle manager’s
authority. In the knowledge organiza- tion we will instead have to ask,
“What is the greatest possible contribution this job can make?” The
focus will have to shift from concern with authority to stress on
responsibil-</p>
<p>ity.</p>
<p>The Need for Clear Decision Authority</p>
<p>The knowledge organization demands clear decision authority. It
demands clear thinking through what decision belongs where (see Chapter
42). The knowledge organization is far more complex than the simple
“line” organization it is replacing. Unless decision author- ity is
clearly spelled out, it will tend to become confused.</p>
<p>The knowledge organization is also designed to take greater risks.
Operating no longer is a “routine” in which the norms are clear. It is a
decision-making organization rather than one that has no other function
than to keep the machinery running at a preset speed and for already
known results. Things, therefore, will go wrong, and in unexpected ways.
And unless authority to change the decision is built into the decision
itself, mal- function is bound to result.</p>
<p>A major pharmaceutical company decided to introduce seven new
products in one year—twice as many as the company had ever introduced
before in a single year. An elaborate multinational strategy was worked
out in year-long sessions of task forces as- sembled from all functions,
all levels, and all major territories. Some products were to be
introduced first into European markets, some into the American market,
some first with general practitioners of medicine, others with
specialists or in hospitals. When the prod- ucts were brought out,
however, the two which had been considered the weakest unex- pectedly
developed into best sellers. But the two supposedly strongest products
ran into unforeseen troubles which sharply slowed down their growth. In
working out the strategy, no one had asked, “If things do not work out
as planned, who is going to be responsible for changing the plan?” As a
result, there were endless reports, endless studies, endless</p>
<p>meetings—and no action. In the end, the company lost much of the
benefit of its accom- plishments. The two products that had shown
unexpected success did not receive the sup- port needed to exploit their
acceptance by the medical profession. Competitors who moved in with
near-imitations were therefore able to reap most of the harvest.
Clinical testing and marketing efforts on the two products that had run
into unexpected difficulties should either have been cut back sharply or
should have been raised sharply. Everyone saw that; but no one had the
authority to make the decision.</p>
<p>In the knowledge organization of the new middle management any
program, any pro- ject, and any plan will have to ask and answer the
question “Who has the authority to change the plan?” And this will lead
to far greater devolution of authority to middle peo- ple than even the
American middle management tradition ever envisaged. Even line man-
agers will need more rather than less authority in the knowledge
organization.</p>
<p>In the pharmaceutical company case the field sales manager of the
relatively small French subsidiary was the only man who could have
prevented the worst damage: the loss to competitors of the market for
the one product which unexpectedly turned into a poten- tial best
seller. But he had neither the information to understand the
significance of his sales results nor the authority to alter his sales
goals and his sales plan. And yet nobody had “made a mistake.” The
French field sales manager was just being treated the way middle
management has traditionally been treated, that is, as somebody who
carries out orders. But in the knowledge organization the line manager
must also be a part of the de- cision and understand what it implies. He
must be given authority commensurate to his responsibility—and this is
not knowledge authority, but command authority. Or, if in any area he
cannot be given the command authority which his task—and his
people—require, it must be perfectly clear, above all to him, where the
command authority lies. (On the implications of this for organization
structure see discussion of “task force team” and “functional”
organization in Chapter 45.)</p>
<p>Top Management’s Role in the Knowledge Organization</p>
<p>In the knowledge organization, top management can no longer assume
that the “operating people” do as they are being told. It has to accept
that the middle ranks make genuine decisions. But the operating
organization can also no, longer assume that it can do its job in
isolation from top management. It must understand the top-management
decisions. In- deed middle management in the knowledge organization must
take responsibility for “educating” top management. Top management must
understand what the knowledge organization tries to do, what it is
capable of doing, and where it sees the major opportu- nities, the major
needs, the major challenges to the enterprise. Finally, middle manage-
ment must insist that top management make decisions on what the business
is and what it should be, on objectives, strategies, and priorities.
Otherwise the middle ranks cannot do their own job.</p>
<p>Top management needs to know the knowledge organization and to
understand it. It needs to establish communication with it. The
traditional American assumption that the people in top management know
the middle manager’s job because they have been through it is no longer
going to be valid. Even the men who have risen into top manage- ment
through the middle-management organization can no longer expect to have
been exposed directly to more than a small sample of the functional work
of the knowledge organization. And some of the most important areas of
middle management will no longer prepare and test a man for
top-management positions.</p>
<p>Indeed the most capable men in such areas will not even want to get
into top- management work but will prefer to stay in their specialty.
The computer specialist wants, as a rule, to stay within his
specialization and work on information and information tech- nology.
Equally, most researchers want to stay in research, whether in physical
and tech- nical fields, in research on people, or in economic
research.</p>
<p>But the assumption that underlies the traditional European approach
is also becoming invalid. Middle managers in knowledge organizations can
no longer be taken for granted</p>
<p>and be treated with condescension as people who, after all, do only
routine tasks and only carry out and implement top-management decisions
and orders. If it wants to be effective, top management therefore needs
to establish team work with, and communications from and to, the
knowledge organization.</p>
<p>The most important “public” in the knowledge organization for top
management—and the one that most needs a relationship to top
management—are the younger and highly specialized knowledge workers.
They most need a “godfather” (see Chapter 20). They are least likely to
understand what top management is trying to do, least likely to see the
business whole, least likely to focus themselves on company objectives
and performance. Yet they are likely, because of their knowledge, to
have impact early in their careers. In any business of any size or
complexity the top-management group needs to organize its relationship
to these younger knowledge professionals.</p>
<p>Each member of the top-management team might sit down a few times a
year with a group of younger knowledge people and say to them, “I have
no agenda. I have nothing I want to tell you. I am here to listen. It is
your job to tell me what you think we in top management need to know
about your work and how you think we can make it most pro- ductive. It
is your job to tell me where you see the problems and opportunities for
this company and to tell me what we in top management do to help you in
your job and what we do that hampers you. I shall insist on only one
thing: that you have done your home- work and that you take seriously
your responsibility to inform and to educate.”</p>
<p>But altogether in the knowledge organization it becomes a
top-management job to mobilize, to organize, to place, and to direct
knowledge. Knowledge people—and that means managers and career
professionals in today’s organization—cannot be seen and treated as
inferiors. They are middle in rank, pay, authority. But they are juniors
and col- leagues rather than subordinates.</p>
<p>“Management” means, in the last analysis, the substitution of thought
for brawn and muscle, of knowledge for folkways and superstition, and of
cooperation for force. It means the substitution of responsibility for
obedience to rank, and of authority of per- formance for authority of
power. The knowledge organization, therefore, is what man- agement
theory, management thinking, management aspirations have been about, all
along. But now the knowledge organization is becoming accomplished fact.
The tremen- dous expansion of managerial employment since World War II
converted the middle ranks into knowledge professionals—that is, people
paid for putting knowledge to work and to make decisions based on their
knowledge which have impact on performance ca- pacity, results, and
future directions of the whole enterprise. The task of making these new
knowledge people in the middle ranks truly effective and achieving has
barely begun. It is a central task in managing managers.</p>
<h4 id="the-spirit-of-performance">36 The Spirit of Performance</h4>
<p>To Make Common Men Do Uncommon Things—The Test Is Performance, Not
Good Feelings—Focus on Strength—Practices, Not Preachments—The Danger of
Safe Me- diocrity—What “Performance” Means—What to Do with the
Nonperformer— “Con- science” Decisions—Focus on Opportunity— “People”
Decisions: The Control of an Organization—Integrity, the Touchstone</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>HE PURPOSE OF AN ORGANIZATION is to enable common men to do uncom-
mon things.</p>
<p>tion is the spirit of performance.</p>
<p>cannot do.</p>
<p>“Morale” in an organization does not mean that “people get along
together”; the test is performance, not conformance. Human relations
that are not grounded in the satisfaction of good performance in work
are actually poor human relations and result in a mean spirit. And there
is no greater indictment of an organization than that the strength and
ability of the outstanding man become a threat to the group and his
performance a source of difficulty, frustration, and discouragement for
the others.</p>
<p>Spirit of performance in a human organization means that its energy
output is larger than the sum of the efforts put in. It means the
creation of energy. This cannot be accom- plished by mechanical means. A
mechanical contrivance can, at its theoretical best, con- serve energy,
but it cannot create it. To get out more than is being put in is
possible only in the moral sphere.</p>
<p>Morality does not mean preachments. Morality, to have any meaning at
all, must be a principle of action. It must not be exhortation, sermon,
or good intentions. It must be practices. Specifically:</p>
<p>1 The focus of the organization must be on performance. The first
requirement of the spirit of organization is high performance standards,
for the group as well as for each individual. The organization must
inculcate in itself the habit of achievement.</p>
<p>But performance does not mean “success every time.” Performance is
rather a “batting average.” It will, indeed it must, have room for
mistakes and even for failures. What performance has no ronm for is
complacency and low standards.</p>
<p>2 The focus of the organization must be on opportunities rather than
on prob- lems.</p>
<p>3 The decisions that affect people: their placement and their pay,
promotion, demotion and severance, must express the values and beliefs
of the organiza-</p>
<p>tion. They are the true controls of an organization.</p>
<p>he has to bring with him and cannot be expected to acquire later on.
And management must demonstrate that it requires the same integrity of
itself.</p>
<p>The Danger of Safe Mediocrity</p>
<p>The constant temptation of every organization is safe mediocrity. The
first requirement of organizational health is a high demand on
performance. Indeed, one of the major reasons for demanding that
management be by objectives and that it focus on the objective re-
quirements of the task is the need to have managers set high standards
of performance for themselves.</p>
<p>This requires that performance be understood properly. Performance is
not hitting the bull’s-eye with every shot—that is a circus act that can
be maintained only over a few minutes. Performance is rather the
consistent ability to produce results over prolonged periods of time and
in a variety of assignments. A performance record must include mis-
takes. It must include failures. It must reveal a man’s limitations as
well as his strengths. And there are as many different kinds of
performance as there are different human beings. One man will
consistently do well, rarely falling far below a respectable standard,
but also rarely excel through brilliance or virtuosity. Another man will
perform only adequately under normal circumstances but will rise to the
demands of a crisis or a major challenge and then perform like a true
“star.” Both are “performers.” Both need to be recognized. But their
performances will look quite different.</p>
<p>The one man to distrust, however, is the man who never makes a
mistake, never com- mits a blunder never fails in what he tries to do.
He is either a phony, or he stays with the safe, the tried, and the
trivial.</p>
<p>A management which does not define performance as a batting average
is a manage- ment that mistakes conformity for achievement, and absence
of weaknesses for strengths. It is a management that discourages and
demoralizes its organization. The better a man is, the more mistakes he
will make—for the more new things he will try.</p>
<p>The man who consistently renders poor or mediocre performance should
be removed from his job for his own good. People who find themselves in
a job that exceeds their capacities are frustrated, harassed,
anxiety-ridden people. One does not do a man a ser- vice by leaving him
in a job he is not equal to. Not to face up to man’s failure in a job is
cowardice rather than compassion.</p>
<p>One also owes it to the man’s subordinates who have a right to be
managed with com- petence, dedication, and achievement. Subordinates
have a right to a boss who performs, for otherwise they themselves
cannot perform.</p>
<p>One owes it finally to all the people in the organization not to put
up with a manager who fails to perform. The entire organization is
diminished by the manager or career pro- fessional who performs poorly
or not at all. It is enriched by the man who performs su- perbly.</p>
<p>At first sight the Japanese seem to violate this rule. For few, if
any, people ever get fired for nonperformance in the Japanese
organization. In actuality the Japanese organiza- tion may be as
demanding and even as competitive as any in the West. The poor or me-
diocre performer is not fired; but he is quickly sidetracked and
assigned the activities which are in effect “made work.” And both he and
the organization know it. Moreover, while everyone advances in pay and
title according to seniority, there is a day of reckon- ing at or around
age forty-five when the very few who will become company directors;</p>
<p>that is, top management, are chosen from the many others who will,
ten years later, retire as section managers or department directors.</p>
<p>The only thing that is proven by a man’s not performing in a given
assignment is that management has made a mistake by putting him in. It
is a mistake that no manager can avoid, no matter how carefully he works
on the placement of people. The fact that a man who has performed in
earlier assignments does not perform in a new one proves nothing except
that he should not have been put in the job in the first place.</p>
<p>“Failure” in such a case may mean only that a first-rate career
professional has been miscast as a manager. It may mean that a man
excellent at running an existing operation has been miscast as an
innovator and entrepreneur. Or it may mean the opposite: that a man
whose strength lies in doing new and different things has been miscast
to head a con- tinuing, well-established, and highly routinized
operation.</p>
<p>Failure to perform on the part of a man who has a record of proven
performance is a signal to think hard about the man and the job. And
sometimes, of course (see the discus- sion of the “widow-maker” job in
Chapter 32) it is the job rather than the man that is at fault.</p>
<p>George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in World War II,
was an uncom- promising and exacting boss who refused to tolerate
mediocrity, let alone failure. “I have a duty to the soldiers, their
parents, and the country, to remove immediately any com- mander who does
net satisfy the highest performance demands,” Marshall said again and
again. But he always asserted, “It was my mistake to have put this or
that man in a com- mand that was not the right command for him. It is
therefore my job to think through where he belongs.” Many of the men who
emerged in World War II as highly successful commanders in the U.S. Army
were once in the course of their careers removed by Mar- shall from an
early assignment. But then Marshall thought through the mistake he had
made—and tried, to figure out where that man belonged. And this
explains, an large measure, why the American Army, which had gone into
World War II without a single one of its future general officers yet in
a command position (these were all held by men past retirement age who
had to be moved out), produced an outstanding group of leaders in a few
short years.</p>
<p>“Conscience” Decisions</p>
<p>The toughest cases, but also the most important ones, are those of
people who have given long and loyal service to the company but who have
outlived their capacity to contribute.</p>
<p>There is, for instance, the bookkeeper who started when the company
was in its in- fancy and grew with it until, at age fifty or so, he
finds himself controller of large com- pany and totally out of his
depth. The man has not changed—the demands of the job have. He has given
faithful service. And where loyalty has been received, loyalty is due.
But still, he must not be allowed to remain as controller. Not only does
his inability to perform endanger the company, his inadequacy
demoralizes the entire management group and discredits management
altogether.</p>
<p>These cases—fortunately not too numerous—challenge the conscience of
an organiza- tion. To keep the man in his job would be betrayal of the
enterprise and of all its people. But to fire a man who has given thirty
years of faithful service is also betraying a trust. And to say, “We
should have taken care of this twenty-five years ago,” while true, is
not much help.</p>
<p>The decision in such cases must be objective, that is, focused on the
good of the com- pany: the man must be removed from his job. Yet the
decision is also a human decision which requires utmost consideration,
true compassion, and an acceptance of obligations. That Henry Ford II
could revive the moribund Ford Motor Company after World War II was in
large measure the result of his understanding the crucial importance of
these “con- science cases.”</p>
<p>At that time, none of the nine management people in one key division
was found to be competent to take on the new jobs created in the course
of reorganization. Not one was</p>
<p>appointed to these new jobs. Yet, for these nine men, jobs as
technicians and experts were found within the organization, jobs which
they could be expected to perform. It would have been easy to fire them.
Their incompetence as managers was undisputed. But they had also served
loyally through very trying years. Henry Ford II took the line that no
one should be allowed to hold a job without giving superior performance
but also laid down that no one should be penalized for the mistakes of
the previous regime. And to the strict observance of this rule the
company owes to a considerable extent its rapid revival. (Inci-
dentally, seven of these men did indeed perform in their new jobs—one so
well that he was later promoted into a bigger job than the one he
originally held. Two men failed; the older one was pensioned off, the
younger one discharged.)</p>
<p>The frequent excuse in a conscience case, “We can’t move him; he has
been here too long to be fired,” is bad logic and rarely more than a
weak-kneed alibi. It does harm to the performance of management people,
to their spirit, and to their respect for the company.</p>
<p>But to fire such a man is equally bad. It violates the organization’s
sense of justice and decency. It shakes its faith in the integrity of
management. “Here, but for the grace of God, go I,” is what everybody
will say—even though he would be the first to criticize if management
left an incompetent in a position of importance.</p>
<p>A management that is concerned with the spirit of the organization
therefore takes these cases exceedingly seriously. They are not too
common, as a rule—or at least, they should not be. But they have impact
on the spirit of the organization way beyond their numbers. How they are
handled will tell the organization both whether management takes itself
and its job seriously, and whether it takes the human being
seriously.</p>
<p>Focus on Opportunity</p>
<p>An organization will have a high spirit of performance if it is
consistently directed toward opportunity rather than toward problems. It
will have the thrill of excitement, the sense of challenge, and the
satisfaction of achievement if its energies are put where the results
are, and that means on the opportunities.*</p>
<p>Of course, problems cannot be neglected. But the problem-focused
organization is an organization on the defensive. It is an organization
that forever considers yesterday to have been the golden age. It is an
organization that feels that it has performed well if things do not get
worse.</p>
<p>A management that wants to create and maintain the spirit of
achievement in its com- pany therefore stresses opportunity. But it will
also demand that opportunities be con- verted into results.</p>
<p>formance and work plan.</p>
<p>“People” Decisions—The Control of an Organization</p>
<p>An organization that wants to build a high spirit of performance
recognizes that “people” decisions—on placement and on pay, on
promotion, demotion, and firing—are the true “control” of an
organization. They, far more than the accountant’s figures and reports,
model and mold behavior. For the people decision signals to every member
of the organi- zation what it is that management really wants, really
values, really rewards.</p>
<p>The company which preaches “our first-line supervisors are expected
to practice hu- man relations” and which then, every time, promotes the
supervisor who gets his paper- work in on time and neatly done, will not
get “human relations.” Even the dumbest fore- man will learn very soon
that what the company really wants is neat paperwork.</p>
<p>*On the opportunity focus, see also my book, Managing for
Results.</p>
<p>Indeed an organization tends to overreact to the people decisions of
management.</p>
<p>What to top management may look like an innocuous compromise to
remove an obstacle or to solve a political impasse may well be a clear
signal to the organization that man- agement wants one kind of behavior
while preaching another.</p>
<p>Placement and promotion are the most crucial people decisions. They,
above all, re- quire careful thinking and clear policy and procedures
which live up to high standards of fairness and equity. They should
never be made on the basis of opinions and on a man’s “potential.” They
should always be based on a factual record of performance against ex-
plicit goals and objectives.</p>
<p>But the best placement and promotion procedures do not insure by
themselves that these crucial decisions fortify and build the spirit of
the organization rather than impair it. For this, top management must
build itself into the promotion process. Above all, it must make sure
that it participates in the key decisions on promotion, the decisions
which, in effect, spell out to the organization what management’s values
and beliefs really are and at the same time determine—often
irrevocably—the top management or tomorrow.</p>
<p>All top managements take an active role in the decisions on promotion
to the jobs di- rectly below or in the top-management group: the
promotion into position of general manager of major divisions or into
position as the head of major functional areas, such as manufacturing or
marketing. But few top managements, especially in larger businesses,
take much interest in the promotion decisions just below the top group,
that is, into such jobs as head of market research, plant manager, head
of pharmacology in the research lab, or even marketing manager of a
division. They leave these decisions to the top people in the respective
functions or divisions. Yet these upper-middle-management jobs are truly
the management to the organization. People further down, and especially
the younger managers and career professionals, know very well that their
own careers depend on these upper-middle people rather than on the big
boss. And it is the decision whom to put into one of these upper-middle
spots which in effect decides who, a few years hence, will be eligible
for a top-management assignment.</p>
<p>Above all, these promotional decisions have the highest symbolical
value. They are highly “visible” and signal to the entire organization,
“This is what this company wants, rewards, recognizes.” For this reason,
old and experienced organizations, such as the Army and the Catholic
Church, put their main concern with promotion on upper-middle
management—in the Army on promotion to the colonelcy, and in the
Catholic Church on selecting an auxiliary bishop.</p>
<p>It would be wise for top management to learn from these examples. It
is well worth top management’s time to take an active part in the
promotions to the levels which for the organization mean management.</p>
<p>Integrity, the Touchstone</p>
<p>The final proof of the sincerity and seriousness of a management is
uncompromising em- phasis on integrity of character. This, above all,
has to be symbolized in management’s “people” decisions. For it is
character through which leadership is exercised; it is charac- ter that
sets the example and is imitated. Character is not something a man can
acquire; if he does not bring it to the job, he will never have it. It
is not something one can fool peo- ple about. The men with whom a man
works, and especially his subordinates, know in a few weeks whether he
has integrity or not. They may forgive a man a great deal: incompe-
tence, ignorance, insecurity, or bad manners. But they will not forgive
his lack of integ- rity. Nor will they forgive higher management for
choosing him.</p>
<p>Integrity may be difficult to define, but what constitutes lack of
integrity of such seri- ousness as to disqualify a man for a managerial
position is not. A man should never be appointed to a managerial
position if his vision focuses on people’s weaknesses rather than on
their strengths. The man who always knows exactly what people cannot do,
but never sees anything they can do, will undermine the spirit of his
organization. Of course, a manager should have a clear grasp of the
limitations of his people, but he should see these</p>
<p>as limitation’s or what they can do, and as challenges to them to do
better. He should be a realist; and no one is less realistic than the
cynic.</p>
<p>A man should not be appointed if he is more interested in the
question “Who is right?”</p>
<p>than in the question “What is right?” To put personality above the
requirements of the work is corruption and corrupts. To ask “Who is
right?” encourages one’s subordinates to play safe, if not to play
politics. Above all, it encourages them to “cover up” rather than to
take corrective action as soon as they find out that they have made a
mistake.</p>
<p>Management should not appoint a man who considers intelligence more
important than integrity. This is immaturity—and usually incurable. It
should never promote a man who has shown that he is afraid of strong
subordinates. This is weakness. It should never put into a management
job a man who does not set high standards for his own work. For that
breeds contempt for the work and for management’s competence.</p>
<p>A man might himself know too little, perform poorly, lack judgment
and ability, and yet not do too much damage as a manager. But if he
lacks in character and integrity—no matter how knowledgeable, how
brilliant, how successful—he destroys. He destroys peo- ple, the most
valuable resource of the enterprise. He destroys spirit. And he destroys
per- formance.</p>
<p>This is particularly true of the people at the head of an enterprise.
For the spirit of an organization is created from the top. If an
organization is great in spirit, it is because the spirit of its top
people is great. If it decays, it does so because the top rots; as the
proverb has it, “Trees die from the top.” No one should ever be
appointed to a senior position unless top management is willing to have
his character serve as the model for his subordi- nates.</p>
<p>This chapter has talked of “practices.” It has not talked of
“leadership.” This was in- tentional. There is no substitute for
leadership. But management cannot create leaders. It can only create the
conditions under which potential leadership qualities become effec-
tive; or it can stifle potential leadership. The supply of leadership is
much too uncertain to be depended upon for the creation of the spirit
the enterprise needs to be productive and to hold together.</p>
<p>But practices, though seemingly humdrum, can always be practiced
whatever a man’s aptitudes, personality, or attitudes. They require no
genius—only application. They are things to do rather than to talk
about.</p>
<p>And the right practices should go a long way toward bringing out,
recognizing, and using whatever potential for leadership there is in the
management group. They should also lay the foundation for the right kind
of leadership. For leadership is not magnetic personality—that can just
as well be demagoguery. It is not “making friends and influenc- ing
people”—that is flattery. Leadership is the lifting of a man’s vision to
higher sights, the raising of a man’s performance to a higher standard,
the building of a man’s personal- ity beyond its normal limitations.
Nothing better prepares the ground for such leadership than a spirit of
management that confirms in the day-to-day practices of the organization
strict principles of conduct and responsibility, high standards of
performance, and respect for the individual and his work.</p>

Right and the Wrong Compromise—The Feedback—Decision-making Is Effective
Action</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>XECUTIVES DO MANY THINGS in addition to making decisions. But only
execu- tives make decisions. The first managerial skill is, therefore,
the making of effective decisions.</p>
<p>There are countless books on the techniques of decision-making.
Complex logical and mathematical tools have been developed for the
decision-making process. But there is little concern with the essential
process itself. What is a “decision”? What are the impor- tant elements
in it?</p>
<p>The only people who have developed a systematic and standardized
approach to deci- sion-making are the Japanese. Their decisions are
highly effective. Yet their approach violates every, rule in the books
on decision-making. Indeed, according to the books, the Japanese should
never be able to arrive at a decision, let alone an effective one. It
might., therefore, be fruitful to take a look at the Japanese way of
decision-making in order to find out what the elements of the process
are.</p>
<p>How the Japanese Make Decisions</p>
<p>If there is one point on which all authorities on Japan are in
agreement, it is that Japanese institutions, whether business or
government agencies, make decisions by consensus. The Japanese, we are
told, debate a proposed decision throughout the organization until there
is agreement on it. And only then do they make the decision.</p>
<p>This, every experienced Western manager will say with a shudder, is
not for us, how- ever well it might work for the Japanese. This approach
can lead only to indecision or politicking, or at best to an innocuous
compromise which offends no one but also solves nothing. And if proof of
this were needed, the American might add, the history of Presi- dent
Lyndon B. Johnson’s attempt to obtain a consensus would supply it.</p>
<p>But what stands out in Japanese history, as well as in today’s
Japanese management behavior, is the capacity for making 180-degree
turns—that is, for reaching radical and highly controversial decisions.
Let me illustrate:</p>
<p>No country was more receptive to Christianity than sixteenth-century
Japan. Indeed, the hope of the Portuguese missionaries that Japan would
become the first Christian coun- try outside of Europe was by no means
just wishful thinking. Yet the same Japan made a 180-degree turn in the
early seventeenth century. Within a few years it completely sup- pressed
Christianity and shut itself off from all foreign influences—indeed,
from all con-</p>
<p>*This chapter draws heavily on my earlier book, The Effective
Executive.</p>
<p>tact with the outside world—and stayed that way for 250 years. Then,
in the Meiji Resto- ration of 1867, Japan executed another 180-degree
turn and opened itself to the West— something no other non-European
country managed to do.</p>
<p>Toyo Rayon (Toray), the largest Japanese manufacturer of man-made
fibers, made nothing but rayon as late as the mid-1950s. Then it decided
to switch to synthetic fibers. But it did not phase out rayon making, as
every Western company in a similar situation has done. Instead, it
closed its rayon mills overnight, even though, under the Japanese system
of employment, it could not lay off a single man.</p>
<p>As late as 1966, when I discussed this matter with its officials, the
Ministry of Interna- tional Trade and Industry was adamantly opposed to
any Japanese companies going mul- tinational and making investments in
manufacturing affiliates abroad. But three years later, the same
ministry officials, working for the same conservative government, had
turned around completely and were pushing Japanese manufacturing
investments abroad.</p>
<p>The key to this apparent contradiction is that the Westerner and the
Japanese mean something different when they talk of “making a decision.”
In the West, all the emphasis is on the answer to the question. Indeed,
our books on decision-making try to develop systematic approaches to
giving an answer. To the Japanese, however, the important ele- ment in
decision-making is defining the question. The important and crucial
steps are to decide whether there is a need for a decision and what the
decision is about. And it is in this step that the Japanese aim at
attaining consensus. Indeed, it is this step that, to the Japanese, is
the essence of the decision. The answer to the question (what the West
con- siders the decision) follows from its definition.</p>
<p>During the process that precedes the decision, no mention is made of
what the answer might be. This is done so that people will not be forced
to take sides; once they have taken sides, a decision would be a victory
for one side and a defeat for the other. Thus the whole process is
focused on finding out what the decision is really about, not what the
decision should be. Its result is a meeting of the minds that there is
(or is not) a need for a change in behavior.</p>
<p>All of this takes a long time, of course. The Westerner dealing with
the Japanese is thoroughly frustrated during the process. He does not
understand what is going on. He has the feeling that he is being given
the runaround.</p>
<p>To take a specific example, it is very hard for a U.S. executive to
understand why the Japanese with whom he is negotiating on, say, a
license agreement, keep on sending new groups of people every few months
who start what the Westerner thinks are “negotia- tions” as if they had
never heard of the subject. One delegation takes copious notes and goes
back home, only to be succeeded six weeks later by another team of
people from different areas of the company who again act as if they had
never heard of the matter un- der discussion, take copious notes, and go
home.</p>
<p>Actually—though few of my Western friends believe it—this is a sign
that the Japa- nese take the matter seriously. They are trying to
involve the people who will have to carry out an eventual agreement in
the process of obtaining consensus that a license is indeed needed. Only
when all of the people who will have to carry out the agreement have
come together on the need to make a decision will the decision be made
to go ahead. Only then do negotiations really start—and then the
Japanese usually move with great speed.</p>
<p>There is a complete account of this process at work—though it does
not concern a business decision. The account deals with the decision to
go to war against the United States in 1941.*</p>
<p>When the Japanese reach the point we call a decision, they say they
are in the action stage. Now top management refers the decision to what
the Japanese call the “appropriate people.” Determination of who these
people are is a top-management decision. On that decision depends the
specific answer to the problem that is to be worked out. For, during the
course of the discussions leading up to the consensus, it has become
quite clear what</p>
<p>*See Japan’s Decision for War, Records of the 1941 Policy
Conferences, translated and edited by Nobutaka Ike (Stanford University
Press, 1967).</p>
<p>basic approaches certain people or certain groups would take to the
problem. Top man- agement, by referring the question to one group or the
other, in effect picks the answer— but an answer which by now will
surprise no one.</p>
<p>This referral to the appropriate people is as crucial as the parallel
decision in the U.S.</p>
<p>political process which baffles any foreign observer of American
government—the deci- sion to which committee or subcommittee of the
Congress a certain bill is to be assigned. This decision is not to be
found in any of the books on U.S. government and politics. Yet, as every
American politician knows, it is the crucial step which decides whether
the bill is to become law and what form it will take. For each
committee—the one on Agriculture, for instance, or the one on Banking
and Finance—has its own well-known point of view, its own “constituents”
to whom it is willing to listen, and its own preferences, taboos, and
sacred cows.</p>
<p>What are the advantages of this process? And what can we learn from
it?</p>
<p>In the first place, it makes for very effective decisions. While it
takes much longer in Japan to reach a decision than it takes in the
West, from that point on they do better than we do. After making a
decision, we in the West spend much time “selling” it and getting people
to act on it. Only too often either the decision is sabotaged by the
organization or, what may be worse, it takes so long to make the
decision truly effective that it becomes obsolete, if not outright
wrong, by the time the people in the organization actually make it
operational.</p>
<p>The Japanese, by contrast, need to spend absolutely no time on
selling a decision.</p>
<p>Everybody has been pre-sold. Also, their process makes it clear where
in the organization a certain answer to a question will be welcomed and
where it will be resisted. Therefore, there is plenty of time to work on
persuading the dissenters, or on making small conces- sions to them
which will win them over without destroying the integrity of the
decision.</p>
<p>Every Westerner who has done business with the Japanese has learned
that the appar- ent inertia of the negotiating stage, with its endless
delays and endless discussion of the same points, is followed by a speed
of action that leaves him hanging on the ropes.</p>
<p>It may take three years before a licensing agreement can be reached,
during which time there is no discussion of terms, no discussion of what
products the Japanese plan to make, no discussion of what knowledge and
help they might need. And then, within four weeks, the Japanese are
ready to go into production and make demands on their Western partner
for information and people which he is totalty unprepared to meet. Now
it is the Japanese who complain, and bitterly, about the “endless delay
and procrastination” of the Westerner. For they understand our way of
making a decision and acting on it no better than we understand their
way of considering a decision and acting on it.</p>
<p>The Japanese process is focused on understanding the problem. The
desired end result is action and behavior on the part of people. This
almost guarantees that all the alterna- tives will be considered. It
rivets management attention to essentials. It does not permit commitment
until management has decided what the decision is all about. Japanese
man- agers may come up with the wrong answer to the problem (as was the
decision to go to war against the United States in 1941), but they
rarely come up with the right answer to the wrong problem. And that, as
all decision-makers learn, is the most dangerous course, the
irretrievably wrong decision.</p>
<p>Above all, their system forces the Japanese to make big decisions. It
is much too cum- bersome to be put to work on minor matters. It takes
far too many people far too long to be wasted on anything but truly
important matters leading to real changes in policies and behavior.
Small decisions, even obviously needed, are very often not being made at
all in Japan for that reason.</p>
<p>With us it is the small decisions which are easy to make—decisions
about things that do not greatly matter. Anyone who knows Western
businesses, government agencies, or educational institutions knows that
their managers make far too many small decisions as a rule. And nothing
causes as much trouble in an organization as a lot of small decisions.
Whether the decision concerns moving the water cooler from one end of
the hall to the</p>
<p>other or the phasing out of one’s oldest business makes little
emotional difference. One decision takes as much time and generates as
much heat as the other.</p>
<p>To contrast the Japanese approach and the Western approach, let me
illustrate: I once watched a Japanese company work through a proposal
for a joint venture received from a well-known American company, with
whom the Japanese had done business for many years. The Orientals did
not even discuss the joint venture at the outset. They started out with
the question “Do we have to change the basic directions of our
business?” As a re- sult, a consensus emerged that change was desirable;
management decided to go out of a number of old businesses and start in
a number of new technologies and markets; the joint venture was to be
one element of a major new strategy. Until the Japanese understood that
the decision was really about the direction of the business, and that
there was need for a decision on that, they did not once, among
themselves, discuss the desirability of the joint venture or the terms
on which it might be set up.</p>
<p>In the West we are moving in the Japanese direction. At least, this
is what the many task forces, long range plans, strategies, and other
approaches are trying to accomplish. But we do not build into the
development of these projects the selling which the Japanese process
achieves before the decision. This explains in large measure why so many
bril- liant reports of task forces and planners never get beyond the
planning stage.</p>
<p>U.S. executives expect task forces and long-range planning groups to
come up with recommendations—that is, to commit themselves to one
alternative. The groups decide on an answer and then document it. To the
Japanese, however, the most important step is understanding the
alternatives available. They are as opinionated as we are. But they dis-
cipline themselves not to commit themselves to a recommendation until
they have fully defined the question and used the process of obtaining
consensus to bring out the full range of alternatives. As a result, they
are far less likely to become prisoners of their pre- conceived answers
than we are.</p>
<p>What are the essentials of the Japanese method of decision-making?
First the focus is on deciding what the decision is all about. The
Japanese do not focus on giving an an-</p>
<p>swer; they focus on defining the question.</p>
<p>The Japanese, second, bring out dissenting opinions; because there is
no discussion of the answer till there is consensus, a wide variety of
opinions and approaches is being ex-</p>
<p>plored.</p>
<p>Third, the focus is on alternatives rather than on the “right
solution.” The process fur- ther brings out at what level and by whom a
certain decision should be made. And finally, it eliminates selling a
decision. It builds effective execution into the decision-making</p>
<p>The specific Japanese system is, indeed, sui generis. It could not be
used elsewhere but presupposes the unique social organization of Japan
and of Japanese institutions. But the principles which the Japanese put
to work in their decision-making process are gener- ally applicable.
They are the essentials of effective decision-making.</p>
<p>Facts or Opinions?</p>
<p>A decision is a judgment. It is a choice between alternatives. It is
rarely a choice between right and wrong. It is at best a choice between
“almost right” and “probably wrong”—but much more often a choice between
two courses of action neither of which is provably more nearly right
than the other.</p>
<p>Most books on decision-making tell the reader: “First find the
facts.” But managers who make effective decisions know that one does not
start with facts. One starts with opinions. These are, of course,
nothing but untested hypotheses and, as such, worthless unless tested
against reality. To determine what is a fact requires first a decision
on the criteria of relevance, especially on the appropriate measurement.
This is the hinge of the effective decision, and usually its most
controversial aspect. But also, the effective deci- sion does not, as so
many tests on decision-making proclaim, flow from a “consensus on the
facts.” The understanding that underlies the right decision grows out of
the clash and</p>
<p>conflict of divergent opinions and out of the serious consideration
of competing alterna- tives.</p>
<p>Conversely, there are few things as futile—and as damaging—as the
right answer to the wrong question.</p>
<p>The effective decision-maker also knows that he starts out with
opinions anyhow. The only choice he has is between using opinions as a
productive factor in the decision- making process and deceiving himself
into false objectivity. People do not start out with the search for
facts. They start out with an opinion. There is nothing wrong with this.
People experienced in an area should be expected to have an opinion. Not
to have an opinion after having been exposed to an area for a good long
time would argue an unob- servant eye and a sluggish mind.</p>
<p>People inevitably start out with an opinion; to ask them to search
for the facts first is even undesirable. They will simply do what
everyone is far too prone to do anyhow: look for the facts that fit the
conclusion they have already reached. And no one has ever failed to find
the facts he is looking for. The good statistician knows this and
distrusts all fig- ures—he either knows the fellow who found them or he
does not know him; in either case he is suspicious.</p>
<p>The only rigorous method, the only one that enables us to test an
opinion against real- ity, is based on the clear recognition that
opinions come first—and that is the way it should be. Then no one can
fail to see that we start out with untested hypotheses—in de-
cision-making, as in science, the only starting point. We know what to
do with hypothe- ses. One does not argue them; one tests them. One finds
out which hypotheses are tenable, and therefore worthy of serious
consideration, and which are eliminated by the first test against
observable experience.</p>
<p>The effective decision-maker therefore encourages opinions. But he
insists that the people who voice them also think through what it is
that the “experiment”—that is, the testing of the opinion against
reality—would have to show. The effective executive, there- fore, asks,
“What do we have to know to test the validity of this hypothesis?” “What
would the facts have to be to make this opinion tenable?” And he makes
it a habit—in himself and in the people with whom he works—to think
through and spell out what needs to be looked at, studied, and tested.
He insists that people who voice an opinion also take responsibility for
defining what factual findings can be expected and should be looked
for.</p>
<p>Perhaps the crucial question here is “What is the measurement
appropriate to the mat- ter under discussion and to the decision to be
reached?” Whenever one analyzes the way a truly effective, a truly
right, decision has been reached, one finds that a great deal of work
and thought went into finding the appropriate measurement.</p>
<p>The Need for Dissent and Alternatives</p>
<p>Unless one has considered alternatives, one has a closed mind. This,
above all, explains why the Japanese deliberately disregard the second
major command of the textbooks on decision-making and create discussion
and dissent as a means to consensus. Decisions of the kind the executive
has to make are not made well by acclamation. They are made well only if
based on the clash of conflicting views, the dialogue between different
points of view, the choice between different judgments. The first rule
in decision-making is that one does not make a decision unless there is
disagreement.</p>
<p>Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., is reported to have said at a meeting of one of
the GM top com- mittees, “Gentlemen, I take it we are all in complete
agreement on the decision here.” Everyone around the table nodded
assent. “Then,” continued Mr. Sloan, “I propose we postpone further
discussion of this matter until our next meeting to give ourselves time
to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what the
decision is all about.”</p>
<p>Sloan was anything but an “intuitive” decision-maker. He always
emphasized the need to test opinions against facts and the need to make
absolutely sure that one did not start out with the conclusion and then
look for the facts that would support it. But he knew that the right
decision demands adequate disagreement.</p>
<p>Every one of the effective presidents in American history had his own
method of pro- ducing the disagreement he needed in order to make an
effective decision. Washington, we know, hated conflicts and quarrels
and wanted a united Cabinet. Yet he made quite sure of the necessary
differences of opinion on important matters by asking both Hamilton and
Jefferson for their opinions.</p>
<p>There are three reasons why dissent is needed. It first safeguards
the decision-maker against becoming the prisoner of the organization.
Everybody always wants something from the decision-maker. Everybody is a
special pleader, trying—often in perfectly good faith—to obtain the
decision he favors. This is true whether the decision-maker is the
president of the United States or the most junior engineer working on a
design modifica- tion.</p>
<p>The only way to break out of the prison of special pleading and
preconceived notions is to make sure of argued, documented,
thought-through disagreements.</p>
<p>Second, disagreement alone can provide alternatives to a decision.
And a decision without an alternative is a desperate gambler’s throw, no
matter how carefully thought through it might be. There is always a high
possibility that the decision will prove wrong—either because it was
wrong to begin with or because a change in circumstances makes it wrong.
If one has thought through alternatives during the decision-making proc-
ess, one has something to fall back on, something that has already been
thought through, studied, understood. Without such an alternative, one
is likely to flounder dismally when reality proves a decision to be
inoperative.</p>
<p>Both the Schlieffen Plan of the German Army in 1914 and President
Franklin D. Roo- sevelt’s original economic program in 1933 were
disproved by events at the very moment when they should have taken
effect.</p>
<p>The German Army never recovered. It never formulated another
strategic concept. It went from one ill-conceived improvisation to the
next. But this was inevitable. For twenty-fire years no alternatives to
the Schlieffen Plan had been considered by the Gen- eral Staff. All its
skills had gone into working out the details of this master plan. When
the plan fell to pieces, no one had an alternative to fall back on. All
the German generals could do, therefore, was gamble—with the odds
against them.</p>
<p>By contrast, President Roosevelt, who, in the months before he took
office, had based his whole campaign on the slogan of economic
orthodoxy, had a team of able people, the later “Brains Trust,” working
on an alternative—a radical policy based on the proposals of the
old-time Progressives, and aimed at economic and social reform on a
grand scale. When the collapse of the banking system made it clear that
economic orthodoxy had be- come political suicide. Roosevelt had his
alternative ready. He therefore had a policy.</p>
<p>Above all, disagreement is needed to stimulate the imagination. One
may not need imagination to find the one right solution to a problem.
But then this is of value only in mathematics. In all matters of true
uncertainty such as the executive deals with—whether his sphere be
political, economic, social, or military—one needs creative solutions
which create a new situation. And this means that one needs
imagination—a new and different way of perceiving and understanding.</p>
<p>Imagination of the first order is, I admit, not in abundant supply.
But neither is it as scarce as is commonly believed. Imagination needs
to be challenged and stimulated, how-</p>
<p>The Trap of “Being Right”</p>
<p>The effective decision-maker does not start out with the assumption
that one proposed course of action is right and that all others must be
wrong. Nor does he start out with the assumption “I am right and he is
wrong.” He starts out with the commitment to find out why people
disagree.</p>
<p>Effective executives know, of course, that there are fools around and
that there are mischief-makers. But they do not assume that the man who
disagrees with what they themselves see as clear and obvious is,
therefore, either a fool or a knave. They know that unless proven
otherwise, the dissenter has to be assumed to be reasonably intelligent
and reasonably fair-minded. Therefore, it has to be assumed that he has
reached his so obvi- ously wrong conclusion because he sees a different
reality and is concerned with a differ- ent problem. The effective
executive, therefore, always asks, “What does this fellow have to see if
his position were, after all, tenable, rational, intelligent?” The
effective executive is concerned first with understanding. Only then
does he even think about who is right and who is wrong.*</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is not done by a great many people, whether
executives or not.</p>
<p>Most people start out with the certainty that how they see is the
only way to see at all. As a result, they never understand what the
decision—and indeed the whole argument—is really all about.</p>
<p>The American steel executives have never asked the question “Why do
these union people get so terribly upset every time we mention the word
‘featherbedding’?” The union people in turn have never asked themselves
why steel managements make such a fuss over featherbedding when every
single instance thereof they have ever produced has proved to be petty,
and irrelevant to boot. Instead, both sides have worked mightily to
prove each other wrong. If either side had tried to understand what the
other one sees and why, both would be a great deal stranger, and labor
relations in the steel industry, if not in U.S. in- dustry, might be a
good deal healthier.</p>
<p>No matter how high his emotions run, no matter how certain he is that
the other side is completely wrong and has no case at all, the executive
who wants to make the right deci- sion forces himself to see opposition
as his means to think through the alternatives. He uses conflict of
opinion as his tool to make sure all major aspects of an important
matter are looked at carefully.</p>
<p>Is a Decision Necessary?</p>
<p>There is one question the effective decision-maker asks: “Is a
decision really necessary?” One alternative is always the alternative of
doing nothing.</p>
<p>One has to make a decision when a condition is likely to degenerate
if nothing is done.</p>
<p>This also applies with respect to opportunity. If the opportunity is
important and is likely to vanish unless one acts with dispatch, one
acts—and one makes a radical change.</p>
<p>Theodore Vail’s contemporaries agreed with him as to the degenerative
danger of government ownership; but they wanted to fight it by fighting
symptoms—fighting this or</p>
<p>*This, of course, is nothing new. It is indeed only a rephrasing of
Mary Parker Follett (see her Dynamic Ad- ministration, ed. by Henry C.
Metcalf and L. Urwick [Harper andandandand Row, 1941]); who in turn only
extended Plato’s arguments in his great dialogue on rhetoric, the
Phaedo.</p>
<p>that bill in the legislature, opposing this or that candidate and
supporting another, and so on. Vail alone understood that this is the
ineffectual way to fight a degenerative condition. Even if one wins
every battle, one can never win the war. He saw that drastic action was
needed to create a new situation. He alone saw that private business had
to make public regulation into an effective alternative to
nationalization.*</p>
<p>It is a rare executive who understands this. The controller who in a
financial crisis preaches cost reduction is seldom capable of leaving
alone minor blemishes, elimination of which will achieve nothing. He may
know, for instance, that the significant costs are in the sales
organization and in physical distribution. And he will work hard and
brilliantly at getting them under control. But then he will discredit
himself and the whole effort by making a big fuss about the
“unnecessary” employment of two or three old men in an oth- erwise
efficient and well-run plant. And he will dismiss as immoral the
argument that eliminating these few semi-pensioners will not make any
difference anyhow. “Other peo- ple are making sacrifices,” he will
argue. “Why should the plant people get away with inefficiency?”</p>
<p>When it is all over, the organization will forget that he saved the
business. They will remember, though, his vendetta against the two or
three poor devils in the plant—and rightly so. De minimis non curat
praetor (The magistrate does not consider trifles) said the Roman law
almost two thousand years ago—but many decision-makers still need to
learn it.</p>
<p>The great majority of decisions will lie between these extremes. The
problem is not going to take care of itself; but it is unlikely to turn
into degenerative malignancy either. The opportunity is only for
improvement rather than for real change and innovation; but it is still
quite considerable. If we do not act, in other words, we will in all
probability sur- vive. But if we do act, we may be better off.</p>
<p>In this situation the effective decision-maker compares effort and
risk of action to risk of inaction. There is no formula for the right
decision here. But the guidelines are so clear that decision in the
concrete case is rarely difficult. They are:</p>
<p>• act if on balance the benefits greatly outweigh cost and risk;
and</p>
<p>• act or do not act; but do not “hedge” or compromise.</p>
<p>The surgeon who takes out only half the tonsils or half the appendix
risks as much in- fection and shock as if he did the whole job. And he
has not cured the condition, has in- deed made it worse. He either
operates or he doesn’t. Similarly, the effective decision- maker either
acts or he doesn’t act. He does not take half-action. This is the one
thing that is always wrong.</p>
<p>Who Has to Do the Work?</p>
<p>When they reach this point, most decision-makers in the West think
they can make an effective decision. But, as the Japanese example shows,
one essential element is still miss- ing. An effective decision is a
commitment to action and results. If it has to be “sold” af- ter it has
been made, there will be no action and no results—and, in effect, no
decision. At the least, there may be so much delay as to obsolete the
decision before it has become truly effective.</p>
<p>*See also Chapter 13.</p>
<p>The first rule is to make sure that everyone who will have to do
something to make the decision effective—or who could sabotage it—has
been forced to participate responsibly</p>
<p>in the discussion. This is not “democracy.” It is salesmanship.</p>
<p>But it is equally important to build the action commitments into the
decision from the start. In fact, no decision has been made unless
carrying it out in specific steps has be- come someone’s work assignment
and responsibility. Until then, there are only good in- tentions.</p>
<p>This is the trouble with so many policy statements, especially of
business: they contain no action commitment. To carry them out is no
one’s specific work and responsibility. No wonder that the people in the
organization tend to view these statements cynically if not as
declarations of what top management is really not going to do.</p>
<p>Converting a decision into action requires answering several distinct
questions: “Who has to know of this decision?” “What action has to be
taken?” “Who is to take it?” “And what does the action have to be so
that the people who have to do it can do it?” The first and the last of
these are too often overlooked—with dire results.</p>
<p>A story that has become a legend among management scientists
illustrates the impor- tance of the question “Who has to know?” A major
manufacturer of industrial equipment decided to discontinue one model.
For years it had been standard equipment on a line of machine tools,
many of which were still in use. It was decided, therefore, to sell the
model to present owners of the old equipment for another three years as
a replacement, and then to stop making and selling it. Orders for this
particular model had been going down for a good many years. But they
shot up temporarily as former customers reordered against the day when
the model would no longer be available. No one had, however, asked, “Who
needs to know of this decision?” Therefore nobody informed the clerk in
the purchasing department who was in charge of buying the parts from
which the model itself was being assembled. His instructions were to buy
parts in a given ratio to current sales—and the instructions remained
unchanged. When the time came to discontinue further production of the
model, the company had in its warehouse enough parts for another eight
to ten years of production, parts that had to be written off at a
considerable loss.</p>
<p>Above all, the action must be appropriate to the capacities of the
people who have to carry it out.</p>
<p>A chemical company found itself, in the early sixties, with fairly
large amounts of blocked currency in two West African countries. To
protect this money, it decided to in- vest in local businesses which
would contribute to the local economy, would not require imports from
abroad, and would if successful, be the kind that could be sold to local
in- vestors if and when a currency remittances became possible again. To
establish these businesses, the company developed a simple chemical
process to preserve a tropical fruit which is a staple crop in both
countries and which, up until then, had suffered serious spoilage in
transit to its markets.</p>
<p>The business was a success in both countries. But in one country the
local manager set the business up in such a manner that it required
highly skilled and, above all, technically trained management of the
kind not easily available in West Africa. In the other country the local
manager thought through the capacities of the people who would
eventually have to run the business and worked hard at making both
process and business simple and at staffing from the start with
nationals of the country right up to the top.</p>
<p>A few years later it became possible again to transfer currency from
these two coun- tries. But though the business flourished, no buyer
could be found for it in the first coun- try. No one available locally
had the necessary managerial and technical skills. The busi- ness had to
be liquidated at a loss. In the other country so many local
entrepreneurs were eager to buy the business that the company
repatriated its original investment with a sub- stantial profit.</p>
<p>The process and the business built on it were essentially the same in
both places. But in the first country no one had asked, “What kind of
people do we have available to make this decision effective? And what
can they do?” As a result, the decision itself became frustrated.</p>
<p>All this becomes doubly important when people have to change
behavior, habits, or attitudes if a decision is to become effective
action. Here one has to make sure not only that responsibility for the
action is clearly assigned and that the people responsible are capable
of doing the needful. One has to make sure that their measurements,
their stan- dards for accomplishment, and their incentives are changed
simultaneously. Otherwise, the people will get caught in a paralyzing
internal emotional conflict.</p>
<p>Theodore Vail’s decision that the business of the Bell System was
service might have remained dead letter but for the yardsticks of
service performance which he designed to measure managerial performance.
Bell managers were used to being measured by the profitability of their
units, or at the least, by cost. The new yardsticks made them accept
rapidly the new objectives.</p>
<p>If the greatest rewards are given for behavior contrary to that which
the few course of action requires, then everyone will conclude that this
contrary behavior is what the people at the top really want and are
going to reward.</p>
<p>Not everyone can do what Vail did and build the execution of his
decisions into the decision itself. But everyone can think through what
action commitments a specific deci- sion requires, what work assignment
follows from it, and what people are available to carry it out.</p>
<p>The Right and the Wrong Compromise</p>
<p>The decision is now ready to be made. The specifications have been
thought through, the alternatives explored, the risks and gains weighed.
Who will have to do what is under- stood. At this point it is indeed
reasonably clear what course of action should be taken. At this point
the decision does indeed almost “make itself.”</p>
<p>And it is at this point that most decisions are lost. It becomes
suddenly quite obvious that the decision is not going to be pleasant, is
not going to be popular, is not going to be easy. It becomes clear that
a decision requires courage as much as it requires judgment. There is no
inherent reason why medicines should taste horrible—but effective ones
usu- ally do. Similarly, there is no inherent reason why decisions
should be distasteful—but most effective ones are.</p>
<p>The reason is always the same: there is no “perfect” decision. One
always has to pay a price. One has always to subordinate one set of
desiderata. One always has to balance conflicting objectives,
conflicting opinions, and conflicting priorities. The best decision is
only an approximation—and a risk. And there is always the pressure to
compromise to gain acceptance, to placate strong opponents of the
proposed course of action or to hedge risks.</p>
<p>For there are two different kinds of compromise. One kind is
expressed in the old proverb “Half a loaf is better than no bread.” The
other kind is expressed in the story of the judgment of Solomon, which
was clearly based on the realization that “half a baby is worse than no
baby at all.” In the first instance, objective requirements are still
being sat- isfied. The purpose of bread is to provide food, and half a
loaf is still food. Half a baby, however, is not half of a living and
growing child. It is a corpse in two pieces.</p>
<p>It is, above all, fruitless and a waste of time to worry about what
is acceptable and what one had better not say so as not to evoke
resistance. The things one worries about never happen. And objections
and difficulties no one thought about suddenly turn out to be almost
insurmountable obstacles. One gains nothing, in other words, by starting
out with the question “What is acceptable?” And in the process of
answering it, one loses any chance to come up with an effective, let
alone with the right, answer.</p>
<p>The Feedback</p>
<p>A feedback has to be built into the decision to provide continuous
testing; against actual events, of the expectations that underlie the
decision. Few decisions work out the way they are intended to. Even the
best decision usually runs into snags, unexpected obstacles, and all
kinds of surprises. Even the most effective decision eventually becomes
obsolete. Unless there is feedback from the results of a decision, it is
unlikely to produce the de- sired results.</p>
<p>This requires first that the expectations be spelled out clearly—and
in writing. Second, it requires an organized effort to follow up. And
this feedback is part of the decision and</p>
<p>has to be worked out in the decision process.</p>
<p>When General Eisenhower was elected president, his predecessor, Harry
Truman, said: “Poor Ike; when he was a general, he gave an order and it
was carried out. Now he is going to sit in that big office and he’ll
give an order and not a damn thing is going to hap- pen.”</p>
<p>The reason why “not a damn thing is going to happen” is, however, not
that generals have more authority than presidents. It is that military
organizations learned long ago that futility is the lot of most orders
and organized the feedback to check on the execution of the order. They
learned long ago that to go oneself and look is the only reliable
feedback.* Reports—all an American president is normally able to
mobilize—are not much help. All military services have long ago learned
that the officer who has given an order goes out and sees for himself
whether it has been carried out. At the least he sends one of his own
aides—he never relies on what he is told by the subordinate to whom the
order was given. Not that he distrusts the subordinate; he has learned
from experience to distrust communi- cations.</p>
<p>One needs organized information for the feedback. One needs reports
and figures. But unless one builds one’s feedback around direct exposure
to reality—unless one disciplines oneself to go out and look—one
condemns oneself to sterile dogmatism and with it to
ineffectiveness.</p>
<p>In sum: decision-making is not a mechanical job. It is risk-taking
and a challenge to judgment. The “right answer” (which usually cannot be
found anyway) is not central. Central is understanding of the problem.
Decision-making, further, is not an intellectual exercise. It mobilizes
the vision, energies, and resources of the organization for effective
action.</p>
<p>*This was certainly established military practice in very ancient
times—Thucydides and Xenophon both take it for ganted, as do the
earliest Chinese texts on war we have—and so did Caeser.</p>

<p>W</p>
<p>E HAVE MORE ATTEMPTS at communications today, that is, more attempts
to talk to others, and a surfeit of communications media, unimaginable
to the men who, around the time of World War I, started to work on the
problems of commu- nicating in organizations. Communications in
management has become a central concern to students and practitioners in
all institutions—business, the military, public administra- tion,
hospital, university, and research. In no other area have intelligent
men and women worked harder or with greater dedication than
psychologists, human relations experts, managers, and management
students have worked on improving communications in our major
institutions.</p>
<p>Yet communications has proven as elusive as the Unicorn. The noise
level has gone up so fast that no one can really listen any more to all
that babble about communications. But there is clearly less and less
communicating. The communications gap within institu- tions and between
groups in society has been widening steadily—to the point where it
threatens to become an unbridgeable gulf of total misunderstanding.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is an information explosion. Every
professional and every ex- ecutive—in fact, everyone except the deaf
mute—suddenly has access to data in, inex- haustible abundance. All of
us feel—and overeat—very much like the little boy who has been left
alone in the candy store. But what has to be done to make this
cornucopia of data redound to information, let alone to knowledge? We
get a great many answers. But the one thing clear so far is that no one
really has an answer. Despite information theory and data processing, no
one yet has actually seen, let adone used, an “information sys- tem,” or
a “data base.” The one thing we do know, though, is that the abundance
of in- formation changes the communications problem and makes it both
more urgent and even less tractable.</p>
<p>There is a tendency today to give up on communications. In
psychology, for instance, the fashion today is the T-group with its
sensitivity training. The avowed aim is not commu- nications, but
self-awareness. T-groups focus on the “I” and not on the “Thou.” Ten or
twenty years ago the rhetoric stressed “empathy”; now it, stresses
“doing one’s thing.” However needed self-knowledge may be, communication
is needed at least as much (if</p>
<p>indeed self-knowledge is possible without action on others, that is,
without communica- tions).</p>
<p>Despite the sorry state of communications in theory and practice, we
have learned a good deal about information and communications. Most of
it, though, has not come out of the work on communications to which we
have devoted so much time and energy. It has been the by-product of work
in a large number of seemingly unrelated fields, from learn- ing theory
to genetics and electronic engineering. We equally have a lot of
experience— though mostly of failure—in a good many practical situations
in all kinds of institutions. We may indeed never understand
“communications.” But “communications in organiza- tions”—call it
managerial communications—we do know something about by now.</p>
<p>We are, to be sure, still far away from mastery of communications,
even in organiza- tions. What knowledge we have about communications is
scattered and, as a rule, not accessible, let alone in applicable form.
But at least we increasingly know what does not work, and, sometimes,
why it does not work. Indeed we can say bluntly that most of to- day’s
brave attempts at communication in organizations—whether business, labor
unions, government agencies, or universities—is based on assumptions
that have been proven to be invalid—and that, therefore, these efforts
cannot have results. And perhaps we can even anticipate what might
work.</p>
<p>What We Have Learned</p>
<p>We have learned, mostly through doing the wrong things, four
fundamentals of communi- cations.</p>
<p>1 Communication is perception.</p>
<p>2 Communication is expectation.</p>
<p>3 Communication makes demands.</p>
<p>4 Communication and information are different and indeed largely
opposite— yet interdependent.</p>
<p>tion.</p>
<p>This may seem trite; after all, the mystics of old already knew this,
for they too always answered that there is no sound unless someone can
hear it. Yet the implications of this rather trite statement are great
indeed.</p>
<p>First, it means that it is the recipient who communicates. The
so-called communicator, the person who emits the communication, does not
communicate. He utters. Unless there is someone who hears, there is no
communication. There is only noise. The communicator speaks or writes or
sings—but he does not communicate. Indeed, he cannot communicate. He can
only make it possible, or impossible, for a recipient—or rather,
“percipient”—to perceive.</p>
<p>Perception, we know, is not logic. It is experience. This means, in
the first place, that one always perceives a configuration. One cannot
perceive single specifics. They are al- ways part of a total picture.
The “silent language,”* that is, the gestures, the tone of voice, the
environment altogether, not to mention the cultural and social
referents, cannot be dissociated from the spoken language. In fact,
without them the spoken word has no meaning , and cannot
communicate.</p>
<p>*As Edward T. Hall called it in the title of his pioneering work
(Doubleday, 1959).</p>
<p>It is not only that the same words, e.g., “I enjoyed meeting you,”
will be heard as hav- ing a wide variety of meanings. Whether they are
heard as warmth or as icy cold, as en- dearment or as rejection depends
on their setting in the “silent language,” such as the tone of voice or
the occasion. More important is that by itself, that is, without being
part of the total configuration of occasion, value, “silent language,”
and so on, the phrase has no meaning at all. By itself it cannot make
possible communication. It cannot be understood. Indeed it cannot be
heard. To paraphrase an old proverb of the human-relations school: One
cannot communicate a word; the whole man always comes with it.”</p>
<p>But we know about perception also that one can perceive only what one
is capable of perceiving. Just as the human ear does not hear sounds
above a certain pitch, so does hu- man perception altogether not
perceive what is beyond its range of perception. It may, of course, hear
physically, or see visually, but it cannot accept it. It cannot become
commu- nication.</p>
<p>This is a fancy way of stating something the teachers of rhetoric
have known for a very long time—though the practitioners of
communications tend to forget it again and again.</p>
<p>In Plato’s Phaedo which, among other things, is also the earliest
extant treatise on rhetoric, Socrates points out that one has to talk to
people in terms of their own experi- ence, that is, that one has to use
carpenters’ metaphors when talking to carpenters, and so on. One can
communicate only in the recipient’s language or in his terms. And the
terms have to be experience-based. It, therefore, does very little good
to try to explain terms to people. They will not be able to receive them
if they are not terms of their own experi- ence. They simply exceed
their perception capacity.</p>
<p>The connection between experience, perception, and concept
formation—that is, cog- nition—is, we now know, infinitely subtler and
richer than any earlier philosopher imag- ined. But one fact is proven
and comes out strongly in the most disparate work, e.g:, that of Piaget
(in Switzerland), that of B. F. Skinner, and that of Jerome Bruner (both
at Har- vard). Percept and concept in the learner, whether child or
adult, are not separate. We cannot perceive unless we also conceive. But
we also cannot form concepts unless we can perceive. To communicate a
concept as impossible unless the recipient can perceive it, that is,
unless it is within his perception.</p>
<p>There is a very old saying among writers: “Difficulties with a
sentence mean confused thinking. It is not the sentence that needs
straightening out, it is the thought behind it.” In writing we attempt,
first, to communicate with ourselves. An “unclear sentence” is one that
exceeds our own capacity for perception. Working on the sentence, that
is, working on what is normally called communications, cannot solve the
problem. We have to work on our own concepts first to be able to
understand what we are trying to say—and only then can we write the
sentence.</p>
<p>In communicating, whatever the medium, the first question has to be
“Is this commu- nication within the recipient’s range of perception? Can
he receive it?”</p>
<p>The “range of perception” is, of course, physiological and largely
(though not en- tirely) set by physical limitations of man’s animal
body. When we speak of communica- tion, however, the most important
limitations on perception are usually cultural and emo- tional rather
than physical. That fanatics are not being convinced by rational
arguments, we have known for thousands of years. Now we are beginning to
understand that it is not “argument” that is lacking. Fanatics do not
have the ability to perceive a communication which goes beyond their
range of emotions. First their emotions would have to be altered. In
other words, no one is really “in touch with reality,” if by that we
mean that he has complete openness to evidence. The distinction between
“sanity” and “paranoia” does not lie in the ability to perceive, but in
the ability to learn, that is, in the ability to change one’s emotions
on the basis of experience.</p>
<p>That perception is conditioned by what we are capable of perceiving
was realized forty years ago by the most quoted but probably least
heeded of all students of organiza- tion, Mary Parker Follett (e.g.,
especially in her collected essays, Dynamic Administra- tion, Harper’s,
1941). Follett taught that a disagreement or a conflict is likely not to
be</p>
<p>about the answers, or indeed about anything ostensible. It is, in
most cases, the result of incongruity in perceptions. What A sees so
vividly, B does not see at all. And, therefore, what A argues, has no
pertinence to B’s concerns, and vice versa. Both, Follett argued, are
likely to see reality. But each is likely to see a different aspect of
it. The world, and not only the material world, is multidimensional. Yet
one can see only one dimension at a time.</p>
<p>One rarely realizes that there could be other dimensions, and that
something that is so obvious to us and so clearly validated by our
emotional experience has other dimensions, a “back” and “sides,” which
are entirely different and which, therefore, lead to entirely different
perceptions. The story I mentioned earlier about the blind men and the
elephant in which each one, encountering this strange beast, feels one
of the elephant’s parts, his leg, his trunk, his hide, and reports an
entirely different conclusion, and holds to it tena- ciously, is simply
a metaphor of the human condition. There is no possibility of commu-
nication until this is understood and until he who has felt the hide of
the elephant goes over to him who has felt the leg and feels the leg
himself. There is no possibility of com- munications, in other words,
unless we first know what the recipient, the true communica- tor, can
see and why.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Communication is expectation. We perceive, as a rule, what we expect
to perceive.</li>
</ol>
<p>We see largely what we expect to see, and we hear largely what we
expect to hear. That the unexpected may be resented is not the important
thing—though most of the work on communications in business and
government thinks it is. What is truly important is that the unexpected
is usually not received at all. It is not seen or heard, but ignored. Or
it is misunderstood, that is, mis-seen or mis-heard as the expected.</p>
<p>On this we now have a century or more of experimentation. The results
are unambigu- ous. The human mind attempts to fit impressions and
stimuli into a frame of expectations. It resists vigorously any attempts
to make it “change its mind,” that is, to perceive what it does not
expect to perceive or not to perceive what it expects to perceive. It
is, of course, possible to alert the human mind to the fact that what it
perceives is contrary to its expec- tations. But this first requires
that we understand what it expects to perceive. It then re- quires that
there be an unmistakable signal “this is different,” that is, a shock
which breaks continuity. A gradual change in which the mind is
supposedly led by small, incre- mental steps to realize that what is
perceived is not what it expects to perceive will not work. It will
rather reinforce the expectations and will make it even more certain
that what will be perceived is what the recipient expects to
perceive.</p>
<p>Before we can communicate, we must therefore, know what the recipient
expects to see and hear. Only then can we know whether communication can
utilize his expecta- tions—and what they are—or whether there is need
for the “shock of alienation,” for an “awakening” that breaks through
the recipient’s expectations and forces him to realize that the
unexpected is happening.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Communication makes demands. Many years ago psychologists stumbled
on a strange phenomenon in their studies of memory, a phenomenon that,
at first, upset all their hypotheses. In order to test memory, the
psychologists compiled a list of words to be shown to their experimental
subjects for varying times as a test of their retention capacity. As
control, a list of nonsense words, mere jumbles of letters, was devised.
Much to the surprise of these early experimenters almost a century ago
or so, their subjects (mostly students, of course) showed totally uneven
memory retention of individual words. More surprising, they showed
amazingly high retention of the nonsense words. The explanation of the
first phenomenon is fairly obvious. Words are not mere information. They
do carry emotional charges. And, therefore words with unpleasant or
threatening associations tend to be suppressed, words with pleasant
associations retained. In fact, this selective reten- tion by emotional
association has since been used to construct tests for emotional disor-
ders and for personality profiles.</li>
</ol>
<p>The relatively high retention rate of nonsense words was a greater
puzzle. It was ex- pected that no one would really remember words that
had no meaning at all. But it has become clear over the years that the
memory for these words, though limited, exists pre-</p>
<p>cisely because these words have no meaning. For this reason, they
make no demand. They are truly neutral. With respect to them, memory
could be said to be truly “mechanical,” showing neither emotional
preference nor emotional rejection.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon, known to every newspaper editor, is the
amazingly high read- ership and retention of the “fillers,” the little
three- or five-line bits of irrelevant incidental information that are
used to “balance” a page. Why should anybody want to read, let alone
remember, that it first became fashionable to wear different-colored
hose on each leg at the court of some long-forgotten duke? Or, when and
where baking powder was first used? Yet there is no doubt that these
little tidbits of irrelevancy are read and, above all, that they are
remembered, far better than almost anything else in the daily paper ex-
cept the screaming headlines of the catastrophes. The answer is that the
fillers make no demands. It is their total irrelevancy that accounts for
their being remembered.</p>
<p>Communication is always “propaganda.” The emitter always wants “to
get something across.” Propaganda, we now know, is both a great deal
more powerful than the rational- ists with their belief in “open
discussion” believe, and a great deal less powerful than the myth-makers
of propaganda, e.g., Dr. Goebbels in the Nazi regime, believed and
wanted us to believe. Indeed the danger of total propaganda is not that
the propaganda will be believed. The danger is that nothing will be
believed and that every communication be- comes suspect. In the end, no
communication is being received. Everything anyone says is considered a
demand and is resisted, resented, and in effect not heard at all. The
end re- sults of total propaganda are not fanatics, but cynics—but this,
of course, may be even greater and more dangerous corruption.</p>
<p>Communication, in other words, always makes demands. It always
demands that the recipient become somebody, do something, believe
something. It always appeals to moti- vation. If, in other words,
communication fits in with the aspirations, the values, the pur- poses
of the recipient, it is powerful. If it goes against his aspirations,
his values, his mo- tivations, it is likely not to be received at all
or, at best, to be resisted. Of course, at its most powerful,
communication brings about “conversion,” that is, a change of personal-
ity, of values, beliefs, aspirations. But this is the rare, existential
event, and one against which the basic psychological forces of every
human being are strangely organized. Even the Lord, the Bible reports,
first had to strike Saul blind before he could raise him up as Paul.
Communications aiming at conversion demand surrender. By and large,
therefore, there is no communication unless the message can key in to
the recipient’s own values, at least to some degree.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Communication and information are different and indeed largely
opposite—yet in- terdependent. Where communication is perception,
information is logic. As such, infor- mation is purely formal and has no
meaning. It is impersonal rather than interpersonal. The more it can be
freed of the human component, that is, of such things as emotions and
values, expectations and perceptions, the more valid and reliable does
it become. Indeed it becomes increasingly informative.</li>
</ol>
<p>All through history, the problem has been how to glean a little
information out of communications, that is, out of relationships between
people, based on perception. All through history, the problem has been
to isolate the information content from an abun- dance of perception.
Now, all of a sudden, we have the capacity to provide information— both
because of the conceptual work of the logicians (especially the symbolic
logic of Russell and Whitehead, which appeared in 1910), and because of
the technical work on data processing and data storage, that is,
especially because of the computer and its tre- mendous capacity to
store, manipulate, and transmit data. Now, in other words, we have the
opposite problem from the one mankind has always been struggling with.
Now we have the problem of handling information per se, devoid of any
communication content.</p>
<p>The requirements for effective information are the opposite of those
for effective communication. Information is, for instance, always
specific. We perceive a configuration in communications; but we convey
specific individual data in the information process. Indeed, information
is, above all, a principle of economy. The fewer data needed, the
bet-</p>
<p>ter the information. And an overload of information, that is,
anything much beyond what is truly needed, leads to information
blackout. It does not enrich, but impoverishes.</p>
<p>At the same time, information presupposes communication. Information
is always en- coded. To be received, let alone to be used, the code must
be known and understood by the recipient. This requires prior agreement,
that is, some communication. At the very least, the recipient has to
know what the data pertain to. Are the figures on a piece of computer
tape the height of mountaintops or the cash balances of Federal Reserve
mem- ber banks? In either case, the recipient would have to know what
mountains are or what banks are to get any information out of the
data.</p>
<p>The prototype information system may well have been the peculiar
language known as Armee Deutsch (Army German) which served as language
of command in the Imperial Austrian Army prior to 1918. A polyglot army
in which officers, noncommissioned offi- cers, and men often had no
language in common, it functioned remarkably well with fewer than two
hundred specific words— “fire,” for instance, or “at ease,” each of
which had only one totally unambiguous meaning. The meaning was always
an action. And the words were learned in and through actions, i.e., in
what behaviorists now call “operant conditioning.” The tensions in the
Austrian Army after many decades of nationalist tur- moil were very
great indeed. Social intercourse between members of different nationali-
ties serving in the same unit became increasingly difficult, if not
impossible. But to the very end, the information system functioned. It
was completely formal; completely rigid; completely logical in that each
word had only one possible meaning; and it rested on completely
pre-established communication regarding the specific response to a
certain set of sound waves. This example, however, shows also that the
effectiveness of an informa- tion system depends on the willingness and
ability to think through carefully what infor- mation is needed by whom
for what purposes, and then on the systematic creation of communication
among the various parties to the system as to the meaning of each
specific input and output. The effectiveness, in other words, depends on
the pre-establishment of communication.</p>
<p>Communication communicates the more levels of meaning it has and the
less it lends itself to quantification.</p>
<p>Medieval esthetics held that a work of art communicates on a number
of levels, at least three if not four: the literal; the metaphorical;
the allegorical; and the symbolic. The work of art that most consciously
converted this theory into artistic practice was Dante’s Divina
Commedia. If by “information” we mean something that can be quantified,
then the Divina Commedia is without any information content whatever.
But it is precisely the ambiguity, the multiplicity of levels on which
this book can be read, from being a fairy tale to being a grand
synthesis of metaphysics, that makes it the overpowering work of art it
is and the immediate communication which it has been to generations of
readers.</p>
<p>Communications, in other words, may not be dependent on information.
Indeed the most perfect communications may be purely “shared
experiences,” without any logic whatever. Perception has primacy rather
than information.</p>
<p>This summary of what we have learned is gross oversimplification. It
glosses over some of the most hotly contested issues in psychology and
perception. Indeed it may well brush aside most of the issues which the
students of learning and of perception, would consider central and
important.</p>
<p>But the aim has not been to survey these big areas. My concern here
is not with learn- ing or with perception. It is with communications,
and in particular, with communications in the large organization, be it
business enterprise, government agency, university, or armed
service.</p>
<p>This summary might also be criticized for being trite, if not
obvious. No one, it might be said, could possibly be surprised at its
statements. They say what “everybody knows.” But whether this be so or
not, it is not what “everybody does.” On the contrary, the logical
implication for communications in organizations of these apparently
simple and obvious statements is at odds with current practice and
indeed denies validity to the honest and serious efforts we have been
making to communicate for many decades now.</p>
<p>Why Downward Communications Cannot Work</p>
<p>What, then, can our knowledge and our experience teach us about
communications in organizations, about the reasons for our failures, and
about the prerequisites for success in the future?</p>
<p>For centuries we have attempted communication “downward.” This,
however, cannot work, no matter how hard and how intelligently we try.
It cannot work, first, because it focuses on what we want to say. It
assumes, in other words, that the utterer communicates. But we know that
all he does is utter. Communication is the act of the recipient. What we
have been trying to do is to work on the emitter, specifically on the
manager, the adminis- trator, the commander, to make him capable of
being a better communicator. But all one can communicate downward are
commands, that is, prearranged signals. One cannot communicate downward
anything connected with understanding, let alone with motiva- tion. This
requires communication upward, from those who perceive, to those who
want to reach their perception.</p>
<p>This does not mean that managers should stop working on clarity in
what they say or write. Far from it. But it does mean that how we say
something comes only after we have learned what to say. And this cannot
be found out by “talking to,” no matter how well it is being done.
“Letters to the Employees,” no matter how well done, will be a waste
unless the writer knows what employees can perceive, expect to perceive,
and want to do. They are a waste unless they are based on the
recipient’s rather than the emitter’s perception.</p>
<p>But “listening” does not work either. The Human Relations School of
Elton Mayo, forty years ago, recognized the failure of the traditional
approach to communications. Its answer* was to enjoin listening. Instead
of starting out with what “we,” that is, the execu- tive, want to “get
across,” the executive should start out by finding out what subordinates
want to know, are interested in, are, in other words, receptive to. To
this day, the human relations prescription, though rarely practiced,
remains the classic formula.</p>
<p>Of course, listening is a prerequisite to communication. But it is
not adequate, and it cannot, by itself, work. Listening assumes that the
superior will understand what he is being told. It assumes, in other
words, that the subordinates can communicate. It is hard to see,
however, why the subordinate should be able to do what his superior
cannot do. In fact, there is no reason for assuming he can. There is no
reason, in other words, to believe that listening results any less in
misunderstanding and miscommunications than does talk- ing. In addition,
the theory of listening does not take into account that communications
is demands. It does not bring out the subordinate’s preferences and
desires, his values and aspirations. It may explain the reasons for
misunderstanding. But it does not lay down a basis for
understanding.</p>
<p>This is not to say that listening is wrong, any more than the
futility of downward communications furnishes any argument against
attempts to write well, to say things clearly and simply, and to speak
the language of those whom one addresses rather than one’s own jargon.
Indeed, the realization that communications have to be upward—or rather
that they have to start with the recipient rather than the emitter,
which underlies the concept of listening—is absolutely sound and vital.
But listening is only the starting point.</p>
<p>More and better information does not solve the communications
problem, does not bridge the communications gap. On the contrary, the
more information, the greater is the need for functioning and effective
communication. The more information, in other words, the greater is the
communications gap likely to be. The information explosion demands
functioning communications:</p>
<p>The more impersonal and formal the information process in the first
place, the more will it depend on prior agreement on meaning and
application, that is, on communica- tions. In the second place, the more
effective the information process, the more imper- sonal and formal will
it become; the more will it separate human beings and thereby re-</p>
<p>*Especially as developed in Mayo’s two famous books, The Human
Problems of an Industrial Civitization (Harvard Business School, 1933)
and The Social Problems of an Industrial Civilization (Harvard Business
School, 1945).</p>
<p>quire separate, but also much greater, efforts, to re-establish the
human relationship, the relationship of communication. It may be said
that the effectiveness of the information process will depend
increasingly on our ability to communicate, and that, in the absence of
effective communication—that is, in the present situation—the
information revolution cannot really produce information. All it can
produce is data.</p>
<p>The information explosion is the most compelling reason to go to work
on communi- cations. Indeed, the frightening communications gap all
around us—between management and workers; between business and
government; between faculty and students, and be- tween both of them and
university administration; between producers and consumers, and so
on—may well reflect in some measure the tremendous increase in
information without a commensurate increase in communications.</p>
<p>What Can Managers Do?</p>
<p>Can we then say anything constructive about communication? Can we do
anything? We can say that communication has to start from the intended
recipient of communications rather than from the emitter. In terms of
traditional organization we have to start upward. Downward
communications cannot work and do not work. They come after upward
communications have successfully been established. They are reaction
rather than action; response rather than initiative.</p>
<p>But we can also say that it is not enough to listen. The upward
communications must be focused on something that both recipient and
emitter can perceive, focused on some- thing that is common to both of
them. They must be focused on what already motivates the intended
recipient. They must, from the beginning, be informed by his values,
beliefs, and aspirations.</p>
<p>Management by objectives is thus a prerequisite for functioning
communication. It re- quires the subordinate to think through and
present to the superior his own conclusions as to what major
contribution to the organization—or to the unit within the
organization—he should be expected perform and should be held
accountable for.</p>
<p>What the subordinate comes up with is rarely what the superior
expects. Indeed, the first aim of the exercise is precisely to bring out
the divergence in perception between superior and subordinate. But the
perception is focused, and focused on something that is real to both
parties. To realize that they see the same reality differently is in
itself already communication.</p>
<p>Management by objectives gives to the intended recipient of
communication—in this case the subordinate—access to experience that
enables him to understand. He is given access to the reality of
decision-making, the problems of priorities, the choice between what one
likes to do and what the situation demands, and above all, the
responsibility for a decision. He may not see the situation the same way
the superior does—in fact, he rarely will or even should. But he may
gain an understanding of the complexity of the superior’s situation and
of the fact that the complexity is not of the superior’s making, but is
inherent in the situation itself.</p>
<p>And these communications, even if they end in a “no” to the
subordinate’s conclu- sions, are firmly focused on the aspirations,
values, and motivation of the intended recipi- ent. In fact, they start
out with the question “What would you want to do?” They may then end up
with the command “This is what I tell you to do.” But at least they
force the supe- rior to realize that he is overriding the desires of the
subordinate. It forces him to explain, if not to try to persuade. At
least he knows that he has a problem—and so does the subor- dinate.</p>
<p>These are only examples, and rather insignificant ones at that. But
perhaps they illus- trate the main conclusion to which our experience
with communications—largely an ex-</p>
<p>perience of failure—and all the work on learning, memory, perception,
and motivation point: communication requires shared experience.</p>
<p>There can be no communication if it is conceived as going from the
“I” to the “Thou.”</p>
<p>Communication works only from one member of “us” to another.
Communication in or- ganization—and this may be the true lesson of our
communication failure and the true measure of our communication need—is
not a means of organization. It is the mode of organization.</p>
<h4 id="controls-control-and-management">39 Controls, Control, and
Management</h4>
<p>Controls and Control—The Characteristics of Controls—Controls Are
Goal-Setting and Value-Setting—Controls Needed for Measurable and for
Nonmeasurable Events—The Specification for
Controls—Economy—Meaning—Controls Follow
Strategy—Appropriateness—Congruence—Timeliness—Simplicity—Controls Must
Be Operational—The Ultimate Control of Organizations—Controls and the
Spirit of an Organization</p>
<p>trol, the two words, in the context of social institutions, have
different meanings alto- gether. The synonyms for controls are
measurement and information. The synonym for control is direction.
Controls pertain to means, control to an end. Controls deal with facts,
that is, with events of the past. Control deals with expectations, that
is, with the future. Controls are analytical, concerned with what was
and is. Control is normative and con- cerned with what ought to be.</p>
<p>We are rapidly acquiring great capacity to design controls in
business and in other so- cial institutions, based on a great
improvement in techniques, especially in the application of logical and
mathematical tools to events in a social institution, and in the ability
to process and analyze large masses of data very fast. What does this
mean for control? Spe- cifically, what are the requirements for these
greatly improved controls to give better con- trol to management? For,
in the task of a manager, controls are purely a means to an end; the end
is control.</p>
<p>Ordinary language and its use make abundantly clear that here is a
problem. The man in a business who is charged with producing the
controls is the controller. But most, if not all executives, including
most controllers themselves, would consider it gross misuse and abuse of
controllership were this controller to use his controls to exercise
control in the business. This, they would argue, would actually make the
business be “out of control” altogether.</p>
<p>The reasons for this apparent paradox lie in the complexity both of
human beings and of the social task.</p>
<p>If we deal with a human being in a social institution, controls must
become personal motivation that leads to control. Instead of a
mechanical system, the control system in a human-social situation is a
volitional system. That we know very little about the will is not even
the central point. A translation is required before the information
yielded by the controls can become grounds for action—the translation of
one kind of information into another, which we call perception.</p>
<p>In the social institution there is a second complexity, a second
“uncertainty principle.”</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to prefigure the responses appropriate to a
certain event in a social situation.</p>
<p>We can, and do, build controls into a machine which slow down the
turning speed whenever it exceeds a certain figure. And we can do this
either by mechanical means or by instrumentation which shows a human
operator what the turning speed is, and which gives him the specific,
unambiguous instruction to turn the speed down when the indicator
reaches a certain point. But a control-reading “profits are falling”
does not indicate, with any degree of probability, the response “raise
prices,” let alone by how much; the control- reading “sales are falling”
does not indicate the response “cut prices,” and so on. There is not
only a large number of other equally probable responses—so large that it
is usually not even possible to identify them in advance—there is also
no indication in the event itself which of these responses is even
possible, let alone appropriate, not to mention its being right. The
event itself may not even be meaningful. But even if it is, it is by no
means certain what it means. And the probability of its being meaningful
is a much more important datum than the event itself and one which is
almost never to be discerned by analyzing the event.</p>
<p>Social situations require a decision based on assumptions—and
essentially assump- tions not with respect to the recorded event but to
the future, that is, expectations which know no probability but can only
be judged according to plausibility. For there are no “facts” regarding
the future in a social universe in which periodicity—at least on our
min- uscule time scale—cannot be assumed, must indeed be considered
quite unlikely.</p>
<p>The Characteristics of Controls</p>
<p>There are three major characteristics of controls in business
enterprise.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Controls can be neither objective nor neutral. When we measure the
rate of fall of a stone, we are totally outside the event itself. By
measuring we do not change the event; and measuring the event does not
change us, the observers. Measuring physical phenom- ena is both
objective and neutral.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everybody who ever watched the introduction of a budget system has
seen this hap- pen. For a long time—in some companies forever—realizing
the budget figures becomes more important than what the budget is
supposed to measure, namely economic perform- ance. Managers, upon first
being exposed to a budget system, often deliberately hold back sales and
cut back profits rather than be guilty of “not making the budget.” It
takes years of experience and a very intelligent budget director to
restore the balance. And there are any number of otherwise perfectly
normal research directors who act on the conviction that it is a greater
crime to get research results for less than the budgeted amount than not
getting any research results at all while spending all the “proper”
budget money.</p>
<p>Controls in a social institution such as a business are goal-setting
and value-setting.</p>
<p>They are not “objective.” They are of necessity moral. The only way
to avoid this is to flood the executive with so many controls that the
entire system becomes meaningless, becomes mere “noise.”</p>
<p>From that point of view maybe the gross abuse of our new
data-processing capacity, namely as a tool for grinding out huge
quantities of totally meaningless data—an abuse of which every early
computer user is guilty—may be a blessing after all.</p>
<p>But to render controls harmless by rendering them meaningless is
hardly the right way to use our capacity to provide controls. This must
start out with the realization that con- trols create vision. They
change both the events measured and the observer. They endow</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Controls need to focus on results. Business (and every other social
institution) ex- ists to contribute to society, economy, and individual.
In consequence results in business exist only on the outside—in economy,
in society, and with the customer. It is the cus- tomer only who creates
a “profit.” Everything inside a business—manufacturing, market- ing,
research, and so on—creates only costs, is only a “cost center.”</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, the managerial area is concerned with costs alone.
But results are en- trepreneurial.</p>
<p>Yet we do not have adequate, let alone reliable, information
regarding the “outside.” It is not only by far the hardest to get—to the
point where no organization for the acquisi- tion and collection of
meaningful outside information could really be set up—the job is much
too big. Above all we still lack necessary entrepreneurial concepts. The
job itself has never been thought through—at least not so far. And the
century of patient analysis of managerial, inside phenomena, events and
data, the century of patient, skillful work on the individual operations
and tasks within the business, has no counterpart with respect to the
entrepreneurial job.</p>
<p>We can easily record and therefore quantify efficiency, that is,
efforts. We have very few instruments to record and quantify effects,
that is, the outside. But even the most effi- cient buggy-whip
manufacturer would no longer be in business. It is of little value to
have the most efficient engineering department if it designs the wrong
product. The Cuban sub- sidiaries of U.S. companies were by far the best
run and, apparently, the most profit- able—let alone the least
“troublesome”—of all U.S. operations in Latin America. This was,
however, irrelevant to their expropriation. And it mattered little, I
daresay, during the period of IBM’s great expansion in the fifties and
sixties how “efficient” its operations were; its basic entrepreneurial
idea was the right, the effective one.</p>
<p>The outside, the area of results, is much less accessible than the
inside. The central problem of the executive in the large organization
is his—necessary—insulation from the outside. This applies to the
president of the United States as well as to the president of United
States Steel. What today’s organization therefore needs are synthetic
sense organs for the outside. If modern controls are to make a
contribution, it would be, above all, here.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Controls are needed for measurable and non-measurable events.
Business, like any other institution, has important results that are
incapable of being measured. Any experi- enced executive knows companies
or industries which are bound for extinction because they cannot attract
or hold able people. This, every experienced executive also knows, is a
more important fact about a company or an industry than last year’s
profit statement. Any logical positivist who were to tell an executive
that this statement, being incapable of un- ambiguous definition, is a
“non-statement” dealing with a “non-problem,” would be quickly—and
correctly—dismissed as an ass. Yet the statement cannot be defined
clearly let alone “quantified.” It is anything but “intangible”; it is
very “tangible” indeed (as any- one ever having to do with such a
business quickly finds out). It is just non-measurable. And measurable
results will not show up for a decade.</li>
</ol>
<p>But business also has measurable and quantifiable results of true
meaning and signifi- cance. These are all those that have to do with
past economic performance. For these can be expressed in terms of the
very peculiar measurement of the economic sphere, money.</p>
<p>This does not mean that these are “tangibles.” Indeed most of the
things we can meas- ure by money are so totally “intangible”—take
depreciation for instance—that they outdo any Platonic Idea in that
nothing corresponds to them in any reality whatever. But they are
measurable.</p>
<p>To this comes the fact that the measurable results are things that
happened; they are in the past. There are no facts about the future. To
this comes, second, the fact that the measurable events are primarily
inside events rather than outside events. The important developments on
the outside, the things which determine that the buggy-whip industry</p>
<p>disappears and that IBM becomes a big business—let alone that Cuban
subsidiaries of American companies are confiscated—are not measurable
until it is too late to have con- trol.</p>
<p>A balance between the measurable and the non-measurable is therefore
a central and constant problem of management and a true decision
area.</p>
<p>Measurements which do not spell out the assumptions with respect to
the non- measurable statements that are being made—at least as
parameters or as restraints— misdirect therefore. They actually
misinform. Yet the more we can quantify the truly measurable areas, the
greater the temptation to put all-out emphasis on those—the greater,
therefore, the danger that what looks like better controls will actually
mean less control if not a business out of control altogether.</p>
<p>Specifications for Controls</p>
<p>To give the manager control, controls must satisfy seven
specifications:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Control is a principle of economy. The less effort needed to gain
control, the better the control design. The fewer controls needed, the
more effective they will be. Indeed, adding more controls does not give
better control. All it does is create confusion.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first question the manager therefore needs to ask in designing or
in using a system of controls is “What is the minimum information I need
to know to have control?”</p>
<p>The answer may vary for different managers. The company’s treasurer
needs only to know the total amount invested in inventories and whether
it is going up or down. The sales manager needs to know the half a dozen
products and product lines which together account for 70 percent of
inventory, and those in considerable detail. But total inventory amount
is not of primary importance to him. And both the treasurer and the
sales manager do not, as a rule, need complete inventory figures except
once or twice a year; a fairly small sample should give them all the
information they need in between. But the ware- house clerk needs daily
figures—and in detail.</p>
<p>The capacity of the computer to spew out huge masses of data does not
make for bet- ter controls. On the contrary, what gives control is first
the question “What is the smallest number of reports and statistics
needed to understand a phenomenon and to be able to anticipate it?” And
then one asks, “And what is the minimum of data regarding this phe-
nomenon that gives a reasonably reliable picture?”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Controls must be meaningful. That means that the events to be
measured must be significant either in themselves, e.g., market
standing, or they must be symptoms of at least potentially significant
developments, e.g., a sudden sharp rise in labor turnover or
absenteeism.</li>
</ol>
<p>Trivia should never be measured. One has control by controlling a few
developments which can have significant impact on performance and
results. One loses control by trying to control the infinity of events
which are marginal to performance and results.</p>
<p>Controls should always be related to the key objectives and to the
priorities within them, to “key activities” and to “conscience areas”
(see Chapter 42). Controls should, in other words, be based on a
company’s definition of what our business is, what it will be, and what
it should be.</p>
<p>Controls Follow Strategy</p>
<p>Whatever is not essential to the attainment of a company’s objectives
should be measured infrequently and only to prevent deterioration. It
should be strictly controlled by “excep- tion,” that is, a standard
should be set, measurement should be periodical and on a sample basis;
and only significant shortfalls below the established standard should
even be re- ported, let alone paid attention to.</p>
<p>That we can quantify something is no reason for measuring it. The
question is “Is this what a manager should consider important?” “Is this
what a manager’s attention should be focused on?” “Is this a true
statement of the basic realities of the enterprise?” “Is this the proper
focus for control, that is, for effective direction with maximum economy
of ef- fort?”</p>
<p>If these questions are not being asked in designing controls, we will
end up by making business essentially uncontrolled—for then we will
simply have no remedy except to pro- liferate control information to the
point where it does not register at all.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Controls have to be appropriate to the character and nature of the
phenomena measured. This may well be the most important specification;
yet it is least observed in the actual design of controls.</li>
</ol>
<p>Formal complaints, that is, grievances, coming out of a work force
are commonly re- ported as “five grievances per thousand employees per
month.” This is formally valid. But is it structurally valid? Or is it
misdirection? The impression this report conveys is, first, that
grievances are distributed throughout the work force in a random manner.
They follow, the report seems to say, a U-shaped Gaussian distribution.
And second—a conclu- sion from the first impression—they are a minor
problem, especially if we deal with five grievances per thousand
employees per month. This, while formally valid, completely
misrepresents and misinforms, let alone misdirects.</p>
<p>Grievances are a social event. Physical nature knows no such
phenomena. And social events are almost never distributed in the “normal
distribution” we find in the physical world. The normal distribution of
social events is almost always exponential—with the hyperbola the
typical curve. In other words, the great majority of departments in the
plant, employing 95 percent of the work force, normally does not have
even a single grievance during one year. But in one department,
employing only a handful of men, we have a heavy incidence of
grievances—so that the “five per thousand” may well mean (and in the
actual example from which I took these figures, did mean) a major
grievance per man per year. If this department is then the final
assembly through which all the production has to pass, and if the
workers in this department go out on strike when their grievances are
be- ing neglected by a management which has been misled by its own
controls, the impact can be shattering. It bankrupted the company, which
is no longer in existence.</p>
<p>Similarly, 90 percent of the volume of a business is usually
represented by 2 to 5 per cent of the number of its products. But 90
percent of the orders by number cover, typi- cally, only 4 or 5 percent
of the volume—but account for 90 percent and more of the costs. A modern
strategic bomber may have a million parts. But 90 percent of its cost is
represented by a very small number of parts, maybe fifty or so—and so is
90 percent of the upkeep it needs, though, unfortunately, the 90 percent
of the dollars and the 90 per- cent of the upkeep needs rarely comprise
the same parts.</p>
<p>Practically all the innovations in a research laboratory, no matter
how large, come out of the work of a very small percentage of the
research people. And invariably, 80 percent of a company’s distributors
move, at best, 20 percent of its output, while 10 percent or fewer of
the distributors move two-thirds to three-quarters of total sales.</p>
<p>Most measurements of sales performance, whether of the entire sales
force or of the individual salesman, report sales in total dollars. But
in many businesses this is an inap- propriate figure. The same dollar
volume of sales may mean a substantial profit, no profit at all, or a
sizable loss—dependent on the product mix sold. An absolute sales figure
not related to product mix, therefore, gives no control whatever—neither
to the individual salesman, nor to the sales manager, nor to top
management.</p>
<p>These are elementary things. Yet few managers seem to know them. The
traditional information systems, especially accounting, conceal
appropriateness rather than highlight it. (In particular the allocation
of overhead tends to obscure the true distribution of eco- nomic and
social phenomena.)</p>
<p>Without controls that bring out clearly what the real structure of
events is, the manager not only lacks knowledge. He will tend to do the
wrong things. For all the weight of the daily work pushes him toward
allocating energies and resources in proportion to the num- ber of
events. There is a constant drift toward putting energies and resources
where they can have the least results, that is, on the vast number of
phenomena which, together, ac- count for practically no effects.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Measurements have to be congruent with the events measured. Alfred
North Whitehead (1851-1947), the distinguished logician and philosopher,
used to warn against the “danger of the false concreteness.” A
measurement does not become more “accurate” by being worked out to the
sixth decimal when the phenomenon measured is at best capa- ble of being
verified within a range of, say, 50 to 70 percent (and that, presumably,
with an error of plus or minus 20 percent). This is “false
concreteness,” gross inaccuracy in reality, and misleading.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is an important piece of information that this or that phenomenon
cannot be meas- ured with precision but can be described only within a
range or as a magnitude. To say “we have 26 percent of the market”
sounds reassuringly precise. But it is usually so inac- curate a
statement as to be virtually meaningless. What it really means, as a
rule, is “we are not the dominant factor in the market, but we are not
marginal either.” And even then the statement is no more reliable than
the definition of the market which underlies it.</p>
<p>It is up to the manager to think through what kind of measurement is
congruent to the phenomenon it is meant to measure. He has to know when
“approximate” is more accu- rate than a firm-looking figure worked out
in great detai1. He has to know when a range is more accurate than even
an approximate single figure. He has to know that “larger” and
“smaller,” “earlier” and “later,” “up” and “down” are quantitative terms
and often more accurate, indeed more rigorous, than any specific figures
or range of figures.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Controls have to be timely. The time dimension of controls is very
similar to their congruence. Again frequent measurements and very rapid
“reporting back” do not neces- sarily give better control. Indeed they
may frustrate control. The time dimension of con- trols has to
correspond to the time span of the event measured.</li>
</ol>
<p>It has lately become fashionable to talk of “real time” controls,
that is, of controls that inform instantaneously and continuously. There
are events where “real time” controls are highly desirable. If a batch
of antibiotics in the fermentation tank spoils as soon as tem- perature
or pressure deviate from a very narrow range for more than a moment or
two, “real time” monitoring on a continuous basis is obviously needed.
But few events need such controls. And most cannot be controlled at all
by them. “Real time” is the wrong time span for real control.</p>
<p>Children planting a garden are so impatient, it is said, that they
tend to pull out the radishes as soon as their leaves show, to see
whether the root is forming. This is “real time” control—misapplied.</p>
<p>When a new product is being first introduced, the product manager may
want and need daily reports from the test markets, and as close to “real
time” as possible. Six months later, when he has worked out his
promotion and selling strategy, daily reports in “real time” can only
lead him into “pulling up the radish to see whether the root is
form-</p>
<p>ing.” He then needs to think through at what periods of time and in
what areas he has to attain what results to be able to achieve his
objectives. And then he has to pay the greatest attention to the
measurement of results at their crucial moments in time. If he, however,
worries about “real time” daily measurements, he is almost bound to
confuse himself and his associates and to muddle even the best strategy.
Similarly, the attempt to measure re- search progress all the time is
likely to confound research results. The proper time span for research
is a fairly long one. Once every two or three years research progress
and re- search results should be rigorously appraised. In between an
experienced manager keeps in touch. He watches for any indication of
major unexpected trouble, and, even more, for any sign of unexpected
breakthroughs. But to monitor research in “real time”—as some research
labs have been trying to do—is pulling up the radishes.</p>
<p>However, there is also the opposite danger—that of not measuring
often enough. It is particularly great with developments that (a) take a
fairly long time to have results, and (b) have to come together at a
point in the future to produce the desired end result.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Controls need to be simple. Every major New York commercial bank
worked in the sixties on developing internal controls, especially of
costs and of allocation of efforts. Everyone spent a great deal of time
and money on the task and came up with voluminous control manuals. In
only one of the banks are the manuals being used, to the best of my
knowledge. When the executive in that bank was asked how he explained
this, he did not (as his interviewer expected him to) credit a massive
training program or talk about his “philosophy.” He said instead, “I
have two teen-age daughters. They know nothing about banking and are not
terribly good at figures. But they are bright. Whenever I had worked out
an approach to controlling an activity, I took my intended procedure
home in draft form and asked my girls to let me explain it to them. And
only when I had it so simple that they could explain back to me what the
procedure intended to accomplish and how, did I go ahead. Only then was
it simple enough.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Complicated controls do not work. They confuse. They misdirect from
what is to be controlled toward attention on the mechanics and
methodology of the control. But if the user has to know how the control
works before he can apply it, he has no control at all. And if he has to
sit down and figure out what a measurement means, he has no control
either.</p>
<p>Indeed, the bank executive’s method is a pretty good one. Training
sessions in using a new control rarely accomplish much. Ask the intended
user to explain its purpose and its use. And when he stumbles over
complexities, ambiguities, or subtleties, redesign for simplicity.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Finally, controls must be operational. They must be focused on
action. Action rather than information is their purpose. The action may
be only study and analysis. In other words, a measurement may say, “What
goes on we don’t understand; but something goes on that needs to be
understood.” But it should never just say, “Here is something you might
find interesting.”</li>
</ol>
<p>This then means that controls—whether reports, studies, or
figures—must always reach the person who is capable of taking
controlling action. Whether they should reach anyone else—and especially
someone higher up—is debatable. But their prime addressee is the manager
or professional who can take action by virtue of his position in the
flow of work and in the decision structure. And this further means that
the measurement must be in a form that is suitable for the recipient and
tailored to his needs.</p>
<p>Workers and first-line supervisors should, as said earlier (Chapter
18) receive meas- urements and control information that enable them to
direct their own immediate efforts toward results they can control.
Instead, typically, the first-line supervisor receives each month a
statement of the quality control results for the entire plant—and the
worker re- ceives nothing.</p>
<p>And top management usually receives the information and measurements
operating middle managers need and can use, and little or nothing of
pertinence to their own top-</p>
<p>management job.</p>
<p>The reason for this is largely a confusion between control as
domination of others and control as rational behavior. Unless controls
are means toward the latter, and this means toward self-control, they
lead to wrong action. They are “mis-control.”</p>
<p>The Ultimate Control of Organizations</p>
<p>There is one more important thing to be said. There is a fundamental,
incurable, basic limitation to controls in a social institution. This
lies in the fact that a social institution is both a true entity and a
fiction. As an entity it has purposes of its own, a performance of its
own, results of its own—and survival and death of its own. These are the
areas of which we have been speaking so far. But a social institution is
comprised of persons, each with his own purpose, his own ambitions, his
own ideas, his own needs. No matter how authoritarian the institution,
it has to satisfy the ambitions and needs of its members, and do so in
their capacity as individuals but through institutional rewards and
punishments, incentives, and deterrents. The expression of this may be
quantifiable—such as a raise in salary. But the system itself is not
quantitative in character and cannot be quantified.</p>
<p>Yet here is the real control of the institution, that is, the ground
of behavior and the cause of action. People act as they are being
rewarded or punished. For this, to them, rightly (as said earlier in
Chapter 36), is the true expression of the values of the institution and
of its true, as against its professed, purpose and role.</p>
<p>A system of controls which is not in conformity with this true, this
only effective, this ultimate control of the organization which lies in
its people decisions will therefore at best be ineffectual. At worst it
will cause never-ending conflict and will push the organization out of
control.</p>
<p>In designing controls for an organization one has to understand and
analyze the actual control of the business, its people decisions.
Otherwise one designs a system of controls which does not lead to
control. One has to realize that even the most powerful “instrument
board” complete with computers, operations research, and simulation, is
secondary to the invisible, qualitative control of any human
organization, its systems of rewards and pun- ishments, of values and
taboos.</p>

to Be Unscientific—The Basic Postulates—The First Need of the Management
Sciences— The Fear of Risk-Taking—What Managers Should Expect—Testing
Assumptions— Right Questions, Not Answers—Alternatives, Not
Solutions—Understanding, Not Formulae—What the Management Sciences
Should Work On—From Potential to Performance</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>HE FIRST MANAGEMENT SCIENTIST was that long-forgotten Italian who,
very early in the Renaissance, invented double-entry bookkeeping. No
other management tool designed since can compare with it in simplicity,
elegance, and utility. Double- entry bookkeeping and all its offsprings
and variations is still the only truly universal “management science,”
the only tool of systematic analysis that every business, and in- deed
every institution, uses every day.</p>
<p>But no one ever talked of double-entry bookkeeping as management
science. That term made its appearance after World War II.* The very
term was a manifesto. “Manage- ment,” it proclaimed, “was to be made
rigorous, scientific, quantitative.” The new tools, with operations
research in the van, would substitute certainly for guesswork, knowledge
for judgment, “hard facts” for experience.</p>
<p>These were, of course, the heady days when it was widely predicted
that the computer would replace the manager. And a good many of the
management scientists, awed by their new shiny tools, similarly saw
themselves “taking over” decision-making control. Most managers have
long learned that the computer will not replace managers (see Chapter
35, “From Middle Management to Knowledge Organization”).</p>
<p>Most have learned that the computer is a tool—very useful if properly
employed, but a tool nonetheless. Most managers also know by now that
the management sciences are tools. Indeed it would have been more
prudent—let alone a little more modest—to speak of “management analysis”
rather than of “management sciences.”</p>
<p>Still, the management sciences are tools with high potential for
contribution. There is no more reason for a manager to be a management
scientist than there is reason for a phy- sician to be a blood chemist
or a bacteriologist. But a manager needs to know what to expect of the
management sciences and how to use them as managerial tools, just as the
physician needs to know what to expect of blood chemistry and
bacteriology and how to use them as diagnostic tools.</p>
<p>For this the manager first needs to understand what the management
sciences try to do—and what they should be doing. He next needs to know
what contributions to expect</p>
<p>*TIMS, The Institute of Management Sciences, which is the
professional society of the management scientists, was founded in 1953
and held its first meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1954.</p>
<p>of them. Few managers, so far, have acquired the skill of making the
management sci- ences contribute to their managerial work. Few, so far,
are putting these new tools to ef- fective work.</p>
<p>Promise and Performance</p>
<p>Most managers know that they need better tools. Most have learned by
bitter experience that intuition is unreliable, if not downright
treacherous, if used as the only basis for deci- sion. Indeed, most
experienced managers have long suspected what a leading manage- ment
scientist of today, Jay W. Forrester of M.I.T., brilliantly demonstrated
in two books:* complex systems actually behave “counter-intuitively”;
the plausible tends to be wrong. And markets, technologies, and
businesses are very complex systems indeed. There is nothing very
startling in this insight; there is nothing more plausible, after all,
than that the earth is flat or that the sun revolves around the
earth.</p>
<p>When management science first appeared it was therefore hailed by
managers with glad cries. Since then, a whole new profession has come
into being: the management sci- entists, with their own professional
associations, their own learned journals, their own departments in
universities, business schools, and schools of technology, and with good
jobs in large numbers within industry.</p>
<p>And yet, management science has been a disappointment. It has not
lived up, so far, to its promise. It certainly has not revolutionized
the practice of management. Few manag- ers, indeed, pay much attention
to it.</p>
<p>The widening gap between the claims and promises of management
science and its use by business is recognized—and deplored—by both
management scientists and managers. Not unexpectedly each blames the
other. Managers complain that management scientists concern themselves
with trivia and “reinvent the wheel.” Management scientists, in turn,
tell horror stories of “resistance by reactionary managers.”</p>
<p>There is a good deal to both complaints. But the truth is more
complex—and far more important than who is to blame.</p>
<p>Why Management Science Fails to Perform</p>
<p>There is one fundamental insight underlying all management science.
It is that the busi- ness enterprise is a system of the highest order: a
system the parts of which are human beings contributing voluntarily of
their knowledge, skill, and dedication to a joint venture. And one thing
characterizes all genuine systems, whether they be mechanical, like the
control of a missile, biological like a tree, or social like the
business enterprise: it is inter- dependence. The whole of a system is
not necessarily improved if one particular function or part is improved
or made more efficient. In fact, the system may well be damaged thereby,
or even destroyed. In some cases the best way to strengthen the system
may be to weaken a part—to make it less precise or less efficient. For
what matters in any system is the performance of the whole; this is the
result of growth and of dynamic balance, adjust- ment, and integration
rather than of mere technical efficiency.</p>
<p>Primary emphasis on the efficiency of parts in management science is
therefore bound to do damage. It is bound to optimize precision of the
tool at the expense of the health and performance of the whole. (That
the enterprise is a social rather than a mechanical system makes the
danger all the greater, for the other parts do not stand still. They
either respond so as to spread the maladjustment throughout the system
or organize for sabotage.)</p>
<p>But when we look at the actual work done by management scientists in
business, we find little that lives up to the basic insight with which
management science starts out.</p>
<p>The bulk of the work done so far concerns itself with the sharpening
of already exist- ing tools for specific technical functions—such as
quality control or inventory control, warehouse location or freight-car
allocation, machine loading, maintenance scheduling, or order handling.
A good deal of the work is little more than a refinement of industrial
en-</p>
<ul>
<li>Urban Dynamics (M.I.T. Press, 1969) and World Dynamics (Wright-Allen
Press, 1971).</li>
</ul>
<p>gineering, cost accounting, or procedures analysis. Some, though not
very much, attention has been given to the analysis and improvement of
functional efforts—primarily those of the manufacturing function but
also, to some extent, of marketing and of money manage- ment.</p>
<p>But there has been little work, little organized thought, little
emphasis on managing an enterprise—on the risk-making, risk-taking,
decision-making job. Throughout manage- ment science—in the literature
as well as in the work in progress—the emphasis is on techniques rather
than on principles, on mechanics rather than on decisions, on tools
rather than on results, and, above all, on efficiency of the part rather
than on performance of the whole.</p>
<p>Technically this is all excellent work. But therein lies its danger.
The new tools are so much more powerful than the old tools of technical
and functional work—the tools of trial and error and of cut and fit—that
their wrong or careless use must do damage.</p>
<p>There are a few significant exceptions. At the General Electric
Company almost twenty years of effort have led to the development of
genuine models of whole businesses showing their basic economic
characteristics and principal interrelationships. Similar work has been
done at the British Coal Board. The potential is there, in other
words.</p>
<p>But most of the actual work has concerned itself with doing a little
better what we al- ready know how to do. We did control inventories,
after all, or allocate freight cars, well before the advent of
management science. And it is unlikely that any business will survive
rather than die, or prosper rather than languish, because we now know
how to do these things better—even significantly better.</p>
<p>W hat explains this under-use—or misuse—of such potentially powerful
tools?</p>
<p>The first clue lies, perhaps, in the origin of the management
sciences—and the origin is an unusual one indeed. Every other discipline
of man began with a crude attempt to define what its subject was. Then
people set to work fashioning concepts and tools for its study. But the
management sciences began with the application of concepts and tools de-
veloped within a host of other disciplines for their own particular
purposes. It may have started with the heady discovery that certain
mathematical techniques, hitherto applied to the study of the physical
universe, could also be applied to the study of business opera-
tions.</p>
<p>As a result, the focus of much of the work in the management sciences
has not been on such questions as “What is the business enterprise?”
“What is managing?” “What do the two do, and what do the two need?”
Rather, the focus has been “Where can I apply my beautiful gimmick?” The
emphasis has been on the hammer rather than on driving in the nail, let
alone on building the house. In the literature of operations research,
for instance, there are several dissertations along the lines of “155
applications of linear program- ming,” but I have not seen any published
study on “typical business opportunities and their characteristics.”</p>
<p>What this indicates is a serious misunderstanding on the part of the
management sci- entist of what “scientific” means. Scientific is not—as
many management scientists na- ively seem to think—synonymous with
quantification. If this were true, astrology would be the queen of the
sciences. It is not even the application of the scientific method. After
all, astrologers observe phenomena, derive the generalization of a
hypothesis therefrom, and then test the hypothesis by further organized
observation. Yet astrology is superstition rather than science because
of its childish assumption that there is a real zodiac, that the signs
in it really exist, and that their fancied resemblance to some such
earthly creature as a fish or a lion defines their character and
properties (whereas all of them are nothing but the mnemonic devices of
the navigators of antiquity).</p>
<p>In other words, “scientific” presupposes a rational definition of the
universe of the science (that is, of the phenomena which it considers to
be real and meaningful) as well as the formulation of basic assumptions
or postulates which are appropriate, consistent, and comprehensive. This
job of defining the universe of a science and of setting its basic pos-
tulates has to be done, however crudely, before the scientific method
can be applied. If it</p>
<p>is not done, or done wrongly, the scientific method cannot be
applied. If it is done, and done right, the scientific method becomes
applicable and indeed powerful.</p>
<p>Management science still has to do this job of defining its universe.
If it does this, then all the work done so far will become fruitful—at
least as preparation and training ground for real achievement. The first
task for management science, if it is to be able to contrib- ute rather
than distort and mislead, is therefore to define the specific nature of
its subject matter.</p>
<p>This might include as a basic definition the insight that the
business enterprise is made up of human beings. The assumptions,
opinions, objectives, and even the errors of people (and especially of
managers) are thus primary facts for the management scientist. Any
effective work in management science really has to begin with analysis
and study of them.</p>
<p>Starting, then, with this recognition of what there is to be studied,
management science must next establish its basic assumptions and
postulates.</p>
<p>It might first include the vital fact that every business enterprise
exists in the economy and in society; that even the mightiest is the
servant of its environment, by which it can be dismissed without
ceremony, but that even the lowliest affects and molds the economy and
society instead of just adapting to them; in other words, that the
business enterprise exists only in an economic and social ecology of
great complexity.</p>
<p>The basic postulates might further include the following ideas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The business enterprise produces neither things nor ideas but
humanly determined values. The most beautifully designed machine is
still only so much scrap metal until it has utility for a
customer.</p></li>
<li><p>Measurements in the business enterprise are such complex, not to
say metaphysical, symbols as money—at the same time both highly abstract
and amazingly concrete.</p></li>
<li><p>Economic activity, of necessity, is the commitment of present
resources to an un- knowable and uncertain future—a commitment, in other
words, to expectations rather than to facts. Risk is of the essence, and
risk-making and risk-taking constitute the basic function of enterprise.
And risks are taken not only by the general manager, but right through
the whole organization by everybody who contributes knowledge—that is,
by every manager and professional specialist. This risk is something
quite different from risk in the statistician’s probability; it is the
risk of the unique event, the irreversible qualita- tive breaking of the
pattern.</p></li>
<li><p>Inside and outside the business enterprise there is constant
irreversible change; in- deed, the business enterprise exists as the
agent of change in an industrial society, and it must be capable both of
purposeful evolution to adapt to new conditions and of purpose- ful
innovation to change the conditions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Some of this is often said in the prefaces of books on the management
sciences. It generally stays in the preface, however. Yet for the
management sciences to contribute to business understanding, let alone
become “sciences,” postulates like the foregoing ought to be the fabric
of its work. Of course we need quantification—though it tends to come
fairly late in the development of a discipline (only now, for instance,
can scientists really quantify in biology). We need the scientific
method. And we need work on specific areas and operations—careful,
meticulous detail work. But above all, we need to recognize the
particular character of business enterprise and the unique postulates
necessary for its study. It is on this vision that we must build.</p>
<p>The first need of a management science is, then, that it respect
itself sufficiently as a distinct and genuine discipline.</p>
<p>The Fear of Risk-Taking</p>
<p>The second clue to what is lacking in the management sciences as
applied today is the emphasis throughout its literature and throughout
its work on “minimizing risk” or even on “eliminating risk” as the goal
and ultimate purpose of its work.</p>
<p>To try to eliminate risk in business enterprise is futile. Risk is
inherent in the commit- ment of present resources to future
expectations. Indeed, economic progress can be de-</p>
<p>fined as the ability to take greater risks. The attempt to eliminate
risks, even the attempt to minimize them, can only make them irrational
and unbearable. It can only result in that greatest risk of all:
rigidity.</p>
<p>The main goal of a management science must be to enable business to
take the right risk. Indeed, it must be to enable business to take
greater risks—by providing knowledge and understanding of alternative
risks and alternative expectations; by identifying the re- sources and
efforts needed for desired results; by mobilizing energies for
contribution; and by measuring results against expectations, thereby
providing means for early correc- tion of wrong or inadequate
decisions.</p>
<p>All this may sound like mere quibbling over terms. Yet the
terminology of risk mini- mization does induce a decided animus against
risk-taking and risk-making—that is, against business enterprise—in the
literature of the management sciences. Much of it ech- oes the tone of
the technocrats of a generation ago. For it wants to subordinate
business to technique, and it seems to see economic activity as a sphere
of physical determination rather than as an affirmation and exercise of
responsible freedom and decision.</p>
<p>This is worse than being wrong. This is lack of respect for one’s
subject matter—the one thing no science can afford and no scientist can
survive. Even the best and most seri- ous work of good and serious
people—and there is no lack of them in the management sciences—is bound
to be vitiated by it.</p>
<p>The second requirement for a management science is, then. that it
take its subject matter seriously.</p>
<p>What Managers Need to Know</p>
<p>But managers too share in the blame for the gap between the potential
and the actual con- tribution of the management sciences. And by and
large, the manager’s share may be the greater one, and the contribution
he needs to make—and has not made—the truly crucial need of management
science and management scientist.</p>
<p>However, the management scientist’s typical complaint about the
manager is, bluntly, nonsense. It is the complaint that the manager does
not bother to learn management sci- ence and remains ignorant. To demand
of any tool user that he understand what goes into the making of the
tool is admission of incompetence on the part of the tool maker. The
tool user, provided the tool is made well, need not, and indeed should
not, know anything about the tool.</p>
<p>The basic problem is much more serious than the unwillingness of
managers to learn a few mathematical techniques. Managers, by and large,
have failed to take managerial re- sponsibility for management
scientists and management sciences. They have refused to accept the fact
that the management scientist, like any other high-grade specialist, de-
pends on the manager for his direction and his effectiveness. They have
left the manage- ment sciences unmanaged—and are therefore largely
responsible for their degenerating into a box of tricks, a “management
gadget bag” of answers to non-existing questions in many cases.</p>
<p>Managers, despite all their apparent enthusiasm for the management
sciences when they first made their appearance, have not, as a rule,
thought through what the manage- ment sciences should or could
contribute.</p>
<p>We know, by and large, what managers need: a systematic supply of
organized knowl- edge for the risk-making and risk-taking decisions of
business enterprise in a complex and rapidly changing technology,
economy, and society.</p>
<p>Tools for the measurement of expectations and results: effective
means for common vision and communication among the many functional and
professional specialists, each with his own knowledge, his own logic,
and his own language, whose combined efforts are needed, however, to
make the right business decisions, to make them effective, and to
produce results.</p>
<p>Managers need something teachable and learnable if only because our
world needs for too many people with managerial vision and competence to
depend on the intuition of a</p>
<p>few “natural-born” geniuses; and only the generalizations and
concepts of a discipline can really be learned or taught.</p>
<p>This becomes clear when one looks at the few places where management
sciences have produced results. In every single case this is not because
the management scientists have done anything they are not doing every
place. It is because managers have asked the right questions and have
managed the management sciences.</p>
<p>One example is a large manufacturer with a broad product line,
selling directly to the public through thousands of outlets, such as
department stores, discount chains, and hardware stores. Its executives
came to their management scientists and said, “Everybody in this
industry knows that extending credit to wholesalers and retailers is the
way to get sales. And everybody also knows that there is a point where
the additional credit risks outbalance the additional sales. Are these
the right assumptions on which to base our sell- ing and credit
policies?” The management scientists came back six months later and
said, “No, these are the wrong assumptions. What everybody knows is, as
so often happens, not true. What is true is that in our industry you can
get additional sales by extending credit to the biggest and best
customers who are also good credit risks, and to the smallest and worst
customers who are also the poorest credit risks. You cannot get
additional sales by extending credit to the ‘average’ customer who is
also an ‘average’ credit risk.” As a re- sult, the company completely
changed its policy. It cut off credit from the small ac- counts—and
while it lost some sales, it greatly improved its selling and credit
perform- ance. And it extended credit to its big and best accounts. The
total amount of credit it now extends is actually less than what it used
to extend when it had a very tight credit policy. But it now has a
rational understanding of the relationship between credit, sales, and
credit risk.</p>
<p>Even more instructive perhaps is the case of one large big-city
hospital which asked its management scientists, “Can you find any
pattern in the patient load which would en- able us to schedule basic
services of the hospital and to plan ahead for the utilization of
services, facilities, and staff? This is our basic problem. But we do
not even know whether we are asking the right questions.” The management
scientists, after about two years of hard work, could show that there
are predictable patterns, both long range and short range. It is
possible to predict, with high probability, the use of scarce
facilities, such as X-ray rooms, X-ray technicians, medical
laboratories, operating rooms, and so on, as well as the length of stay
of patients and thereby utilization of room and bed capacity. But they
also said, “In one area you are not asking the right questions: what
kind of beds do we need and how many of them? All the beds in the
hospital are beds for seriously sick people, that is, beds requiring
high capital investment; yet no more than one-third of the patients at
any one time require this kind of a bed and this kind of facility.
Another third require what, in effect, are convalescent beds, with a
capital investment no more than half that of the acute-sickness bed; and
yet another third require probably nothing but a motel mom with a
minimum of service and a minimum of capital investment.”</p>
<p>What managers, in other words, need to do to make management science
capable of contribution is to think through the areas in which they need
to have basic assumptions tested.</p>
<p>Managers expect management scientists to come up with answers where
nobody has asked them the right question. They expect the management
scientist, that is, a technical specialist, to know better than a
manager what the needs, the problems, the questions of a business
are.</p>
<p>Above all, they expect final answers. But the great strength of
management science— whether its methods be those of the physical
sciences, of economics, or of the social sci- ences (and a good
management scientist needs to be at home in all three areas) is its ca-
pacity for, asking questions. The manager himself will have to give
answers. For answers in business are always judgment, always choice
between alternatives of different and yet uncertain risks, always a
blend of knowledge, experience, and hopes.</p>
<p>To make the management sciences capable of contribution, the manager
has to de- mand of them that they identify the right questions to ask.
Managers, as a rule, expect the</p>
<p>management sciences to come up with one best solution. But what the
management sci- ences should be able to contribute are the alternatives
available to the manager. They should be expected to say, “Here are four
or five different courses of action. Not one of them is perfect. Each
has its own risks, its own uncertainties, its own limitations, and its
own costs. Each of them, however, satisfies at least some of the major
specifications. You, the manager, will have to choose between them. You
will have to decide on one of them, at least as the lesser evil. Which
one you choose is your decision. It is your judg- ment regarding the
risks the company can take. It is your judgment with respect to the
things you can sacrifice and the things you have to insist on. But at
least you now know what choices are available to you.”</p>
<p>There are no “solutions” with respect to the future. There are only
choices between courses of action, each imperfect, each risky, each
uncertain, and each requiring different efforts and involving different
costs. But nothing could help the manager more than to realize what
alternatives are available to him and what they imply. And this the
manage- ment scientist can supply with varying degrees of precision.</p>
<p>Finally the manager should expect his management scientists to
provide understanding rather than formulae. The formulae are the tools
of the management scientist and are of little interest to the manager.
If he cannot assume that the management scientist knows his craft, he
better get himself another management scientist. But understanding, that
is, in- sight into what a decision is really about, is something he
should hold the management scientist accountable for. What the
management sciences can contribute—and should be expected to
contribute—is understanding that a certain decision, while it looks like
a de- cision on manufacturing, is really a decision on marketing. It is
a decision on what cus- tomers will want, will be willing to pay for,
will buy. What a manager should expect from his management scientists is
to hear, “Look, the problem you assigned us is the wrong problem. This
is the problem we ought to be working on.”</p>
<p>The greatest contribution a group of management scientists made to
the pharmaceuti- cal company which employed them was not solutions. It
was to say to management, “All your efforts, all your energies, all your
attention are focused on the new products. But three-quarters of your
income today and for the foreseeable future will come from drugs that
have been in the inventory at least three years. Nobody manages them,
nobody sells them, nobody knows what to do with them. In fact, nobody
has the s1ightest interest in them. The only thing we know is that the
way to keep old drugs in the market is com- pletely different from what
is needed to introduce new ones. But what managing an exist- ing product
line of old and established drugs requires we do not know. This,
however, is what we should be studying.”</p>
<p>These four demands and expectations:</p>
<p>are the keys to making the management sciences productive. They all
are based on the assumption that the management sciences are not methods
of computation but tools of analysis. They all assume that the purpose
of the management sciences is to help with diagnosis. They are insights
and not prescription, let alone wonder drugs.</p>
<p>But they all require also that the manager take responsibility for
the management sci- ences. They all require that the manager manage
these tools. They all require of the man- ager that he decide, in close
working relationship with the management scientists, what the management
scientists should go to work on. They should not go to work on the
things that are interesting to the management scientists and easily
amenable to their tools. They should go to work on the areas in which a
manager needs understanding. And if these areas are areas in which the
tools are not particularly appropriate, areas, for in-</p>
<p>stance, in which quantification is difficult or perhaps even
impossible, this should not deter manager or management scientists.
Insight, understanding, ranking of priorities, and a “feel” for the
complexity of an area are as important as precise, beautifully elegant
mathematical models—and in fact usually infinitely more useful and
indeed even more “scientific.” They reflect the reality of the manager’s
universe and of his tasks.</p>
<p>It is up to the manager to convert the management sciences from
potential to perform- ance. To do this he has to understand what the
management sciences are and what they can do. He has to understand the
peculiar limitations which are inherent in the manage- ment sciences
largely as a result of their origin and history. But above all he has to
under- stand that the management sciences are the manager’s tools, and
not the tools of the man- agement scientist. And it is up to the manager
to focus these tools on managerial tasks and direct them toward
managerial contributions.</p>

<p>“ F THE MAKING OF ORGANIZATION STUDIES there is no end”; this
might</p>
<p>ganizing companies, divisions, and functions has been one of the more
spectacular “growth industries” of the last few decades. Everybody,
whether government department or armed service, research laboratory,
Catholic diocese, university administration, or hos- pital—in addition
to countless businesses—seems forever to be engaged in reorganizing and
being reorganized. Management consultants, thirty or forty years ago,
concerned themselves mainly with work study, production flow, and sales
training. In the sixties they got the bulk of their assignments and
revenues from organization studies, especially of large companies and
government departments.</p>
<p>Even the Bank of England, which had admitted no outsiders through its
doors for al- most three hundred years, was finally reorganized by one
of the large American consult- ing firms; and to add insult to injury,
it was a Labour government that, violating the pri- vacy of the “Old
Lady of Threadneedle Street,” forced an organization study on it.</p>
<p>There are reasons for this interest in organization and for the
underlying conviction that inherited organization structures or
structures that “just grew” are unlikely to be ap- propriate to the
needs of the enterprise. Above all, we have learned the danger of the
wrong organization structure. The best structure will not guarantee
results and perform- ance. But the wrong structure is a guarantee of
nonperformance. All it produces are fric- tion and frustration. The
wrong organization puts the spotlight on the wrong issues, ag- gravates
irrelevant disputes, and makes a mountain out of trivia. It accents
weaknesses and defects instead of strengths. The right organization
structure is thus a prerequisite of performance.</p>
<p>The small enterprise needs right structure just as badly as the big
one—and may find it more difficult to work it out.</p>
<p>Only a few short decades ago, such interest as there was in
organization was to be found only in very large businesses. The earlier
examples, e.g., the example of Alfred P. Sloan’s organization structure
for General Motors in the early twenties, were all examples of large
businesses.</p>
<p>Today, we know that organization becomes critical, above all, when a
small business grows into a medium-sized one, and a simple business into
a complicated one. (See Chap- ter 53.) The small business that wants to
grow, even into only a medium-sized business, therefore has to think
through and work out the right organization which enables it at one and
the same time to function as a small business and to be able to grow
into something bigger. Similarly, the simple one-product, one-market
business faces crucial organization problems the moment it adds even a
little diversity or complexity.</p>
<p>As recently as the early or middle fifties, managers still had to be
convinced that they need to pay attention to the organization of work
and the design of organization structure.</p>
<p>The most stubborn opposition to the reorganization of the General
Electric Company in the early fifties did not come from those who
objected to the seemingly radical propos- als. It came from GE managers
who did not see the need for doing anything about organi- zation. They
admitted that the inherited structure was a crazy, shapeless jumble
which the business had long outgrown. “But why waste time on
organization?” they asked. “We make and sell turbines, so why bother
about who does what?” Ten years later this was still the reaction of
many managers when Paul Chambers, as new chief executive of England’s
Imperial Chemical Industries, tackled the organization structure of
another giant that had “just grown.”</p>
<p>Today one often needs, on the contrary, to convince managements not
to rush into or- ganization studies and not to become enamored of
reorganization as an end in itself—or as a substitute for strategic
planning and business decisions.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s Final Answers</p>
<p>But while we have accepted that organization and management structure
are crucial, we are outgrowing yesterday’s “final answers.”</p>
<p>Twice in the short history of management did we have the “final
answer” to organiza- tion. The first time was around 1910 after Henri
Fayol, the French industrialist, had thought through what, to this day,
are the functions of a manufacturing company. At that time the
manufacturing business was, of course, the truly important
organizational prob- lem.</p>
<p>A generation later one could again say that we “knew.” Fayol had
given “the answer”</p>
<p>for the single-product manufacturing business. Alfred P. Sloan, Jr.,
in organizing General Motors in the early twenties, made the next step.
He found “the answer” for organizing the complex and large manufacturing
company.* The Sloan approach, which used Fayol’s functional organization
for the subunits, the individual “divisions,” but organized the business
itself on the basis of “federal decentralization,” that is, on the basis
of decentral- ized authority and centralized control, became after World
War II the organization model worldwide, especially for larger
organizations.</p>
<p>Another generation later, that is, by the early seventies, it had
become clear that the General Motors model was no more adequate to the
realities, or at least to the most im- portant challenges in
organization, than Fayol’s model was adequate to the realities of a very
big business which Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., faced when he tackled the task
of making General Motors manageable and managed.</p>
<p>Where they fit the realities that confront designer and architect of
organization struc- ture, Fayol’s and Sloan’s models are still
unsurpassed. Fayol’s functional organization is still the best way to
structure a small business, especially a small manufacturing business.
Sloan’s federal decentralization is still the best structure for the big
multi-product com- pany. Indeed (see Chapters 45 through 48) none of the
new design structures that have emerged in the decades since World War
II are nearly as close to fulfilling the design specifications of
organization structure as are functional organization and federal decen-
tralization if and when they fit. But more and more of the institutional
reality that has to be structured and organized does not fit. Indeed,
the very assumptions that underlay</p>
<p>*Sloan drew heavily on Pierre du Pont’s slightly earlier work at the
Du Pont Company. On this see the two books by Alfred D. Chandler listed
in the Bibliography.</p>
<p>Sloan’s work—and that of Fayol—are not applicable to major
organization needs and challenges.</p>
<p>Traditional Assumptions and Current Needs</p>
<p>The best way, perhaps, to bring out the current needs of organization
structure is to con- trast the basic characteristics of the General
Motors Company which Sloan so success- fully structured with current
needs and realities of organization and structure.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>General Motors is a manufacturing business, producing and selling
highly engi- neered goods. And Fayol too was concerned with a business
producing physical goods; his model was a fair-sized coal-mining
company. Today we face the challenge of organiz- ing the large business
that is not exclusively or even primarily a manufacturing business.
There are not only the large financial institutions and the large
retailers. There are world- wide transportation companies,
communications companies, companies which, while they manufacture, have
their center of gravity in customer service (such as most computer
businesses). Then there are, of course, all the non-business service
institutions with which Chapters 11 through 14 dealt. These
non-manufacturing institutions are increasingly the true center of
gravity of any developed economy. They employ the most people. They both
contribute and take the largest share of gross national product. They
are the funda- mental organization problems today.</p></li>
<li><p>General Motors is essentially a single-product,
single-technology, single-market business. More than four-fifths of its
sales are automotive. The cars which General Mo- tors sells differ in
details, such as size, horsepower, and price, but they are essentially
one and the same product. Indeed, most U.S. “made by GM” cars,
regardless of nameplate, are now assembled in the same plants and under
one assembly manager. A man who came up the line in, say, the Pontiac
Division, will hardly find Chevrolet totally alien—and even Opel in
Germany will not hold a great many surprises for him.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By contrast, the typical businesses of today are multi-product,
multi-technology, and multi-market businesses. They may not be
“conglomerates.” But they are “diversified.” And their central problem
is a problem General Motors did not have: the organization of complexity
and diversity.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>General Motors is still primarily a U.S. company. It looms very
large on the inter- national automobile market. But the foreign markets
do not loom very large for GM (though perhaps they should). In America
General Motors dominates the automobile in- dustry. But only in
Australia—a secondary market—does General Motors dominate any non-U. S.
market. In Europe it is at best number four. Organizationally the world
outside the United States is still, for GM, “separate” and “outside.”
Organizationally GM is still an American company, and its top management
is primarily concerned with the American market, the American economy,
the American labor movement, the American govern- ment, and so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>By contrast, the most rapid growth in the last twenty-five years has
been the multina- tional company, that is, the company for which a great
many countries and a great many markets are of equal importance, or at
least are of major importance.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Because GM is a one-product and one-country company, information is
not a major organizational problem and need not be a major
organizational concern. Everyone in GM speaks the same language, whether
by that we mean the language of the automotive indus- try or American
English. Everyone fully understands what the other one is doing or
should be doing, if only because, in all likelihood, he has done a
similar job himself. GM can therefore be organized according to the
logic of the marketplace, and the logic of au- thority and decision. It
need not, in its organization, concern itself a great deal with the
logic and the flow of information.</li>
</ol>
<p>By contrast, multi-product, multi-technology, and multinational
companies will have to concern themselves in their organizational design
and structure with organization ac- cording to the flow of information.
At the very least they will have to make sure that their organization
structure does not violate the logic of information. And for this GM
offers no guidance—GM did not have to tackle the problem.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Four out of every five GM employees are production workers, either
manual work- ers or clerks on routine tasks. GM, in other words, employs
yesterday’s, rather than to- day’s, labor force.</li>
</ol>
<p>But the basic organization problem today is knowledge work and
knowledge workers.</p>
<p>They are the fastest-growing element in every business. In the
service institutions, they are the core employment.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Finally, General Motors has been a “managerial” rather than an
“entrepreneurial”</li>
</ol>
<p>business. The strength of Sloan’s approach lay in its ability to
manage, and manage su- perbly, what was already there and known. General
Motors has not been innovative— altogether the automobile industry has
not been innovative since the days before World War I. (There was
innovation at General Motors. But it was essentially the contribution of
one man, Charles Kettering, who was indeed an innovative genius of the
first order. But GM itself did not have to organize for entrepreneurship
and innovation.)</p>
<p>But the challenge is going increasingly to be entrepreneurship and
innovation. What we need is the innovative organization—in addition to
the managerial one. And for this, the General Motors model offers no
guidance.</p>
<p>The need for new approaches is therefore again as great in the field
of organization as it was when Fayol and Sloan each did his pioneering
work. The period when federal de- centralization could be considered the
universal model—as it largely was in the quarter century of the
management boom—is at an end.</p>
<p>But of course we have learned a great deal in the three-quarters of a
century since Fayol’s generation first tackled organization. We know
what the job is. We know the ma- jor approaches. We know what comes
first. We know what will not work—though not always what will. We know
what organization structure aims at and therefore what the test of
successful organization design is.</p>
<p>What We Have Learned</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first thing we have learned is that Fayol and Sloan were right:
organization struc- ture will not just “evolve.” The only things that
evolve in an organization are disorder, friction, malperformance. Nor is
the right—or even the livable-structure “intuitive”—any more than Greek
temples or Gothic cathedrals were. Traditions may indicate where the
problems and malfunctions are but are no help in finding solutions to
them. Organization design and structure require thinking. analysis, and
a systematic approach.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is, of course, what Fayol did in his functions. But the trouble
is not only that these functions fit only a manufacturing company. Above
all, Fayol tried to design his functions according to the work they
did.</p>
<p>We now know that building blocks are determined by the kind of
contribution they make. And we know that the traditional classification
of the contributions—e.g., the “staff and line” concept of conventional
American organization theory—is more of a hindrance to understanding
than a help.</p>
<p>Designing the building blocks is, so to speak, the “engineering
phase” of organization design. It provides the basic “materials.” And
like all materials, these building blocks</p>
<p>have their specific characteristics. They belong in different places
and fit together in dif- ferent ways.</p>
<p>strategy.*</p>
<p>Structure is a means for attaining the objectives and goals of an
institution. Any work on structure must therefore start with objectives
and strategy. This is perhaps the most fruitful new insight we have in
the field of organization. It may sound obvious, and it is. But some of
the worst mistakes in organization building have been made by imposing a
mechanistic model of an “ideal” or “universal” organization on a living
business.</p>
<p>Strategy, i.e., the answers to the questions “What is our business,
what should it be, what will it be?”, determines the purpose of
structure. It thereby determines what the key activities are in a given
business or service institution. Effective structure is the design that
makes these key activities capable of functioning and of performance.
And in turn the key activities are the “Load-bearing elements” of a
functioning structure. Organization design is, or should be, primarily
concerned with the key activities; the rest are secondary.</p>
<p>The Three Kinds of Work</p>
<p>It was a misunderstanding to define the building blocks as different
kinds of work. But there are different kinds of work in every
organization, however small and simple.</p>
<p>There is, first, operating work, that is, the work of managing what
is already in exis- tence and known, building it, exploiting its
potential, taking care of its problems.</p>
<p>There is always top-management work. And (as will be discussed in
Chapers 49 through 52) it is different work, with its own tasks and
requirements.</p>
<p>Finally, there is innovative work—and it too (see Chapter 61) is
different work, re- quiring different things with respect to both
operations and top management.</p>
<p>As will be seen in the subsequent chapters of this section, no one of
the available de- sign principles can be used for organizing all three
different kinds of work. Yet they need to be organized. They need to be
integrated into one overall organization,</p>
<p>What We Need to Unlearn</p>
<p>There are also a few things we need to unlearn. Some of the noisiest
and most time- consuming battles in organization theory and practice are
pure sham. They pose an “ei- ther/or “; yet the right answer is “both—in
varying proportions.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The first of these sham battles which better be forgotten fast is
that between task- focus and person-focus in job design and organization
structure. To repeat what has been said already (Chapter 32), structure
and job design have to be task-focused. But assign- ments have to fit
both the person and the needs of the situation. There is no point in
con- fusing the two as the old and tiresome discussion of the
non-problem insists on doing. Work, to say it once more, is objective
and impersonal; the job itself is done by a person.</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhat connected with this old controversy is the discussion of
hierarchical ver- sus free-form organization. Traditional organization
theory knows only one kind of struc- ture applicable alike to building
blocks and whole buildings: the so-called scalar organi- zation, that
is, the hierarchical pyramid of superior and subordinates. Traditional
organi- zation theory considers this structure suitable for all
tasks.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>*The fundamental work on this was done by Alfred D. Chandler in his
book, Strategy and Structure (M.I.T. Press, 1962), a depth study of the
design of modern organization in pioneering American companies, such as
Du Pont, General Motors, and Sears.</p>
<p>Today another—equally doctrinaire—organization theory is becoming
fashionable. It maintains that shape and structure are what we want them
to be—they are, or should be, “free-form.” Everything—shape, size, and
apparently tasks—derive from interpersonal relations. Indeed the purpose
of the structure is to make it possible for each person to “do his
thing.”</p>
<p>The first thing to say about this controversy is that it is simply
not true that one of these forms is regimentation and the other freedom,
the amount of discipline required in both is the same; they only
distribute it differently.</p>
<p>A hierarchy does not, as the critics allege, make the superior more
powerful. On the contrary, the first effect of hierarchical organization
is the protection of the subordinate against arbitrary authority from
above. A scalar or hierarchical organization does this by defining
carefully the sphere within which the subordinate has the authority, the
sphere within which the superior cannot interfere. It protects the
subordinate by making it possi- ble for him to say, “This is my assigned
job.” Protection of the subordinate underlies also the scalar
principle’s insistence that a man have only one superior. Otherwise the
subordi- nate is likely to find himself caught between conflicting
demands, conflicting commands, and conflicts of interest as well as of
loyalty. “Better one had master than two good ones,” says an old peasant
proverb.</p>
<p>The first organization structure of the modern West was laid down in
the canon law of the Catholic Church eight hundred years ago. It set up
a strictly scalar organization. But most of the provisions in the canon
law that deal with the structure and organization of the Catholic Church
define those things which only the parish priest, i.e., the bottom man
in the pyramid, can do in his parish. The bishop appoints him; and,
within clear procedural limits, the bishop can remove him. But within
his parish only the parish priest can dis- charge the parish priest’s
canonical functions, e.g., dispense the sacraments of baptism and
matrimony or hear confession. Even the Pope has to be formally invited
by the indi- vidual priest before he can officiate in a priest’s
parish.</p>
<p>At the same time, the hierarchical organization gives the most
individual freedom. As long as the incumbent does whatever the assigned
duties of his position are, he has done his job. He has no
responsibility beyond it.</p>
<p>There is much talk these days about the individual’s “doing his
thing.” But the only organization structure in which this is remotely
possible is a hierarchical one. It makes the least demands on the
individual to subordinate himself to the goals of the organization or to
gear his activities into the needs and demands of others. Altogether,
the more clearly a structure defines work, authority, and relationships,
the fewer demands does it make on the individual for self-discipline and
self-subordination.</p>
<p>Free-form organization is, of course, a misnomer. What is meant is
organization de- sign for specific tasks rather than for supposedly
“eternal” purposes. In particular, what is meant is organization of work
in small groups and teams.</p>
<p>This (as will be discussed in some detail in later chapters of this
section) demands, above all, very great self-discipline from each member
of the team. Everybody has to do “the team’s thing.” Everybody has to
take responsibility for the work of the entire team and for its
performance. Indeed, Abraham Maslow’s criticism* of Theory Y as making
inhuman demands on that large proportion of people who are weak,
vulnerable, timid, impaired, applies with even greater force to
free-form organization. The more flexible an organization is, the
stronger do the individual members have to be and the more of the load
do they have to carry.</p>
<p>But also, hierarchy is needed in any structure by both individual
members and the en- tire organization. There has to be someone who can
make a decision; or else the organiza- tion deteriorates into a
never-ending bull session. The knowledge organization in particu- lar
needs extreme clarity with respect to decision authority and specific,
designated “channels” (see Chapter 35). Every organization will find
itself in a situation of common</p>
<p>*See Chapter 19.</p>
<p>peril once in a while. And then all perish unless there is clear,
unambiguous, designated command authority vested in one person.</p>
<p>The hierarchy versus free-form argument is simply another version of
the oldest and stalest argument in political theory: the argument
between the constitutional lawyer who—rightly—insists that there have to
be good and clear laws, and the educator who— equally rightly—insists
that the best constitution fails unless there are upright rulers.</p>
<p>And just as statesmen learned long ago that both good laws and good
rulers are needed, so organization builders (and even organization
theorists) will have to learn that sound organization structure needs
both a hierarchical structure of authority, decision- making, and
pyramid, and the capacity to organize task forces, teams, and
individuals for work both on a permanent and a temporary basis.</p>
<p>Both the advocates of hierarchical and those of free-form
organization assume, if only</p>
<p>unconsciously, that an organization must have one axis. It must be
either hierarchical or “free-form.” But this is a mechanistic
assumption—and organization is a social phenome- non.</p>
<p>The classical organization structure was, indeed, presumed to have
only one axis: that of formal authority downward and “reporting” upward.
But the first studies of actual or- ganization in the early work of the
“human relations school” in the twenties* brought out immediately a
second structure present in every work group studied. The human
relations people called it—misleadingly— “informal” organization
(“unwritten” organization would have been better; there is nothing
informal about an informal organization which, being based on custom
rather than explicit rules, tends to be more formal and, above all, to
be far less flexible than the written rules of the formal organization
chart). Still, the belief persists that organization structure should be
“single-axis” structure.</p>
<p>But every system higher than the simplest mechanical assemblage of
inanimate matter is a “multi-axis” system. An animal body such as that
of man has a skeletal-muscular sys- tem, a number of nervous systems, an
ingestive-digestive-eliminating system, a respira- tory system, sense
organs each a system, a procreative system, and so on. Each is
autonomous. Yet all interact. Each is an “axis of organization.”</p>
<p>No business could or should be as complex as a biological organism.
Yet the organi- zations we need to design and to structure—the
organizations of business enterprise and public-service institution—have
a number of axes: decision-authority but also informa- tion; the logic
of the task but also the dynamics of knowledge. That individual jobs
have to be designed and positioned in contemplation of a number of
axes—task and assign- ments; decision-responsibility; information and
relations—has been discussed earlier (in Chapter 32).</p>
<p>The same applies to organization design and structure.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>At bottom these sham battles—between task-focus and person-focus and
between scalar and free-form organization—reflect the belief of
traditional organization theory that there must be “one best principle”
which alone is “right” but which is also always “right.” There must be
one final answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps; but if so, we do not know it. Instead of the “one right”
principle, three new major design principles have emerged in the
twenty-five years since World War II ended, to join Fayol’s functions
and Sloan’s federal decentralization. These three—the team, simulated
decentralization, and systems management—do not supersede the older de-
signs. None of them could lay claim to being a “universal” principle;
indeed, all three have both serious structural weaknesses and limited
applicability. But they are the best answers available for certain kinds
of work, the best structures available for certain tasks, the best
approaches to such major organization problems as top management,
innovation, the structure of comparison in the materials; transportation
and financial industries or the multinational corporation.</p>

<p>The final tradition we will have to unlearn therefore is that “there
must be one final</p>

century ago, these were the tasks to which the organizer had to address
himself before he could design struc- ture.</p>
<p>We therefore now have a considerable amount of experience. There are
no prescrip- tions for the design of the building blocks or for the
design of the structure itself. But one can clearly indicate what the
right approaches are and what approaches are unlikely to work.</p>
<p>The traditional approach to the identification of the basic units of
organization has been to analyze all the activities needed for
performance in the enterprise.* This then re- sults in a list of typical
functions of a manufacturing business or of a retail business.</p>
<p>This approach to the typical functions sees organization as
mechanical, as an assem- blage of functions. But organization has to be
“organic.” Organizations will indeed use typical activities—though not
necessarily all of them. But how the structure is to be built depends on
what results are needed. Organizing has to start out with the desired
results.</p>
<p>The Key Activities</p>
<p>What we need to know are not all the activities that might
conceivably have to be housed in the organization structure. What we
need to know are the load-bearing parts of the structure, the key
activities.</p>
<p>Organization design, therefore, starts with these questions:</p>
<p>*I still followed this approach in The Practice of Management in
1954.</p>
<p>In what area is excellence required to obtain the company’s
objectives?</p>
<p>In what areas would lack of performance endanger the results, if not
the survival, or the enterprise?</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the kind of conclusions these questions
lead to. Sears, Roebuck in the United States and Marks andandandand
Spencer in England are in many ways re- markably similar, if only
because the founders and builders of Marks andandandand Spencer con-
sciously modeled their company on Sears, Roebuck. But there is a
pronounced difference in the organizational placement and organizational
role of the “laboratory” in these two companies. Sears, which defines
its business as being “the buyer for the American fam- ily,” uses its
laboratory to test the merchandise it buys. Accordingly, the laboratory,
while large, competent, and respected, is organizationally quite
subordinate. Marks andandandand Spencer, on the other hand, defined its
business as mentioned earlier (Chapter 8), as “developing upper-class
goods for the working-class family.” As a result, the laboratory is
central to Marks andandandand Spencer’s organization structure. The
laboratory rather than the buyer decides what new products are
desirable, develops the new merchandise, designs it, tests it, and then
gets it produced. Only then does the buyer take over. As a result, the
head of the Marks andandandand Spencer laboratory is a senior member of
management and, in many ways, the chief business planner.</p>
<p>Any company that shows outstanding success will be found to have made
the key ac- tivities—and especially those in which excellence is needed
to attain business perform- ance and business objectives—the central,
load-carrying elements in its organization structure.</p>
<p>But equally important are the questions “In what areas could
malfunction seriously damage us? In what areas do we have major
vulnerability?” They are questions, however, that are much less often
asked.</p>
<p>The New York brokerage community, by and large, did not ask it. If it
had, it would have realized that malfunction of the “back office,” where
customer orders, customer ac- counts and securities are handled, could
seriously endanger the business. Failure to organ- ize the back office
as a key activity was the single most important cause for the severe
crisis that overtook Wall Street in 1969 and 1970 and destroyed a good
many of the best- known and apparently most successful firms. The one
Wall Street firm, however, that had asked those questions, Merrill
Lynch, and had organized the back office as a load-bearing key activity
in its structure, emerged from the crisis the giant of the brokerage
business.</p>
<p>Finally, the question should be asked “What are the values that are
truly important to us in this company?” It might be product or process
safety. It might be product quality. It might be the ability of the
company dealers to give proper service to the customer and so on.
Whatever the values are, they have to be organizationally anchored.
There has to be an organizational component responsible for them—and it
has to be a key component.</p>
<p>These three questions will identify the key activities. And they in
turn will be the load- bearing, the structural elements of organization.
The rest, no matter how important, no matter how much money they
represent, no matter how many people they employ, are secondary.
Obviously, they will have to be analyzed, organized, and placed within
the structure. But the first concern must be those activities that are
essential to the success of a bussiness strategy and to the attainment
of business objectives. They have to be identi- fied, defined,
organized, and centrally placed.</p>
<p>An analysis of key activities is needed in the business that has been
going for some time, and especially in the business that has been going
well. In such a business the analy- sis will invariably reveal that
important activities are either not provided for or are left hanging in
midair to be performed in a haphazard fashion. It will almost invariably
bring out activities that, once important, have lost most of their
meaning but continue to be or- ganized as major activities. It will
demonstrate that historically meaningful groupings no longer make sense
but have, instead, become obstacles to proper performance. And it will
certainly lead to the discovery of unnecessary activities that should be
eliminated.</p>
<p>The new business needs such thinking. But the greatest need for
key-activity analysis is found in the business that has been growing
fast (see Chapter 60). Rapid growth is both</p>
<p>a disorganized and a disorganizing process. The enterprise that
starts out, so to speak, in a lowly but functional two-room cottage,
puts in, as it grows, a new wing here, an attic there, a partition
elsewhere, until it is housed in a twenty-six-room monstrosity in which
all but the oldest inhabitants need a St. Bernard to bring them back
from the water cooler. To reorganize mechanically in such a
situation—the usual approach—will make things worse. To copy the “GM
organization” in such a situation will put on a tremendous super-
structure of “staff “ and “coordinators” without remedying the basic
structural defects. Only a key-activities analysis starting out from
objectives and strategy can provide the organization structure the
business really needs.</p>
<p>A business should always analyze its organization structure when its
strategy changes.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason—a change in market or in technology,
diversification or new objec- tives—a change in strategy requires a new
analysis of the key activities and an adaptation of the structure to
them. Conversely, reorganization that is undertaken without a change in
strategy is either superfluous or indicates poor organization to begin
with.</p>
<p>The Contributions Analysis</p>
<p>From the earliest days of concern with organization, a hundred years
ago, the most con- troversial question has been “What activities belong
together and what activities belong apart?” A number of answers have
been given over the years.</p>
<p>Perhaps the earliest one was the German division of a business into
two major areas: the “technical,” embracing research, engineering, and
production, and the “commercial,” embracing sales and finance. Somewhat
later came “line” and “staff,” which tried to dis- tinguish “operating”
and non-operating “advisory” activities. Finally there was Henri Fayol’s
analysis of functions, defined (too narrowly) as “bundles of related
skills,” which still underlies the typical organization of most
businesses.</p>
<p>All of these have merit. But a more searching analysis is needed
which groups activi- ties by the kind of contribution they make. There
are, by and large, four major groups of activities, if distinguished by
their contribution.</p>
<p>There are, first, result-producing activities—that is, activities
which produce measur- able results which can be related, directly or
indirectly, to the results and performance of the entire enterprise.
Some of these activities are directly revenue-producing. Others con-
tribute measurable results.</p>
<p>There are, second, support activities which, while needed, and even
essential, do not by themselves produce results but have results only
through the use made of their “out- put” by other components within the
business.</p>
<p>There are, third, activities which have no direct or indirect
relationship to the results of the business, activities which are truly
ancillary. They are hygiene and housekeeping activities.</p>
<p>Finally, and different in character from any of these, is the
top-management activity (which will be discussed separately in Chapters
49 through 52).</p>
<p>Among the result-producing activities, there are some that directly
bring in revenues (or, in service institutions, directly produce
“patient care” or “learning”). Here belong innovating activities,
selling and all the work needed to do a systematic and organized selling
job, such as sales forecasting, market research, sales training, and
sales manage- ment. Here also belongs the treasury function, that is,
the supply and management of money in the business.</p>
<p>In a commercial bank, all lending operations, the fiduciary
activities of managing other people’s money, and, of course, the
money-making operation of the bank itself, that is, the management of
its own liquid funds, are revenue-producing activities. In a depart-
ment store buying and selling are always revenue-producing operations
(and at Marks andandandand Spencer innovation has also been a
revenue-producing activity). In a life insurance com- pany selling is
obviously revenue-producing. But so is the actuarial activity insofar as
it develops new types or policy; and finally, investment is an
important—in many insurance companies the most
important—revenue-producing activity.</p>
<p>duce a “finished product” that is needed by everyone in the system.
Information perform- ance can also be defined and measured, or at least
appraised. Yet information, by itself, does not produce any revenue. It
is “supply” to revenue and cost centers alike.</p>
<p>First among the “support” activities which do not by themselves
produce a “product”</p>
<p>but are “input” to others stand the “conscience” activities. These
activities set standards, create vision, and demand excellence in all
the key areas where a business needs to strive for excellence.</p>
<p>Conscience activities tend to be slighted in most organizations. But
every company— and every service institution—needs to provide itself and
its managers with vision, with values, with standards, and with some
provision for auditing performance against these standards.</p>
<p>There are indeed in all larger businesses people who are supposed to
do this job, usu- ally the executives who head up major “service
staffs.” But their first duty is not to be the organization’s conscience
but to be servant of, and advisor to, operating managers. As a result
they rarely get around to doing the conscience job systematically.
Instead they run departments.</p>
<p>Another support function is advice and teaching, i.e., the
traditional service staffs. The contribution is not in what the activity
itself does or can do, but the impact it has on the ability of others to
perform and to do. The “product” is an increased performance capacity of
the rest of the organization.</p>
<p>A good many of the “relations activities are also “support”—as is the
legal staff, or the patent department.</p>
<p>The last group of activities defined by their contribution are the
hygiene and house- keeping activities, ranging from the medical
department to the people who clean the floor, from the plant cafeteria
to the management of pension and retirement funds, from finding a plant
site to taking care of all the manifold record-keeping requirements
imposed on business by government. These functions contribute nothing
directly to the results and performance of the business. Their
malfunction, however, can damage the business. They serve legal
requirements, the morale of the work force, or public responsibilities.
Of all activities they are the most diverse. And of all activities they
tend to get the shortest shrift in most organizations.</p>
<p>This is a very rough classification, and far from scientific. Some
activities may be put into one category in one business, into another
one in another, and in a third company will be left fuzzy and without
clear classification at all.</p>
<p>In some manufacturing companies, manufacturing is a cost center. It
contributes re- sults but does not generate revenue. But there are some
true manufacturing businesses, i.e., businesses whose revenue is
generated by manufacturing sans research, sans engi- neering, sans
selling. There are businesses where licensing, selling, and buying of
patents are major revenue producers.</p>
<p>Purchasing, while normally a support activity, can also be defined as
part of a result- contributory activity: “materials management,” which
includes manufacturing and physi-</p>
<p>cal distribution, all three managed together to minimize costs of
goods and money needs, and maximize quality, delivery, and customer
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Why classify then? The answer is that activities that differ in
contribution have to be treated differently. Contribution determines
ranking and placement.</p>
<p>Key activities should never be subordinated to non-key
activities.</p>
<p>Revenue-producing activities should never be subordinated to
non-revenue-producing activities.</p>
<p>And support activities should never be mixed with revenue-producing
and result- contributory activities. They should be kept apart.</p>
<p>The “Conscience” Activities</p>
<p>Activities that are the conscience of an organization must never be
subordinated to any- thing else. They also should never be placed with
any other activity; they should be clearly separate.</p>
<p>The conscience function of giving vision, of setting standards, and
of auditing per- formance against these standards is basically a
top-management function. But it has to work with the entire management
group. Every business, even a small business, needs this function. In a
small business, it need not be set up as a separate function but can be
dis- charged as part of the top-management job. In any business of more
than medium size, however, the function has usually to be set up and
staffed separately.</p>
<p>However, there should be very few people actually doing the
conscience job. It is a job for a single individual rather than a staff.
It is a job for a man whose performance has earned the respect of the
management group. It is not a job for a “specialist.” It is best
discharged by a senior member of the management group with proven
performance record who has manifested concern, perception, and interest
in the area for which he is supposed to act as the conscience.</p>
<p>Only those few areas that are vital and central to a company’s
success and survival should become areas of conscience. Objectives and
strategy determine what conscience activities are needed. Managing
people is always a conscience area, and so is marketing. The impact of a
business on its environment, its social responsibilities and basic
relations with the outside community, are also basic conscience areas.
Innovation (whether techno- logical or social innovation) is likely to
be a conscience area for any large business.</p>
<p>Beyond these, however, there is no formula.</p>
<p>Conscience work is incompatible with operating and with giving
advice. The only ac- tivity that should “report” to a man in charge of a
conscience activity is auditing the actual performance of managers. For
it is not enough to have vision and to set standards. Per- formance of
the organization against these standards needs to be appraised
regularly.</p>
<p>“Conscience,” many people will argue, is a very strong, in addition
to being a rather strange, term. But it is the right term. The task of
the conscience activities is not to help the organization do better what
it is already doing. The task is to remind the organization all the time
of what it should be doing and isn’t doing. The task is to be
uncomfortable, to hold up the ideal against the everyday reality, to
defend the unpopular and to fight the expedient.</p>
<p>This requires, however, self-discipline on the part of the conscience
executive and ac- ceptance of his competence and integrity on the part
of the organization.</p>
<p>The tenure of the few conscience executives should be limited as a
rule. No matter how greatly a conscience executive may be respected, and
no matter how successful he has been, he will eventually wear out either
his integrity or his welcome. This is a good place for a senior man to
end a distinguished career. A younger man in the job should be moved out
after a few years—preferably back into a “doing” job.</p>
<p>Making Service Staffs Effective</p>
<p>There are similarly stringent rules with respect to advisory and
teaching, activities, that is, with respect to service staffs.</p>
<p>There should be very few of them. They should be set up only in key
activity areas. It is counterproductive to have a service staff in every
function. The secret of effective work is concentration rather than
busyness.</p>
<p>Advisory and teaching staffs should never try to do a little bit of
everything. They should zero in on a very small number of crucial areas.
Rather than serve everybody they should select “targets of opportunity,”
i.e., areas within the organization where the man- agers are receptive
and do not have to be “sold,” and where achievement generates “mul-
tiplier impact” throughout the whole company.</p>
<p>The staffs and their activities should be kept lean.</p>
<p>The supply of men of the right temperament for this kind of work is
not very large. To do a decent job in an advisory and teaching capacity
requires a man who genuinely wants others to get the credit. It requires
a man who starts out with the aim of enabling others to do what they
want to do, provided only that it is neither immoral nor insane. It
requires further a man who has the patience to let others learn rather
than go and do the work him- self. And finally, it requires a man who
will not abuse his position in headquarters close to the seat of power
to politick, to manipulate, and to play favorites. People who possess
these personality traits are rare. Yet people without them in services
work can do only mischief.</p>
<p>One basic rule for advisory and teaching staffs is that they abandon
an old activity be- fore they take on a new one. Otherwise they will
soon start to “build empires” or to pro- duce “canned goods,” that is,
programs and memoranda, rather than develop the knowl- edge and
performance capacity of the operating men whose job it is to produce.
They will also otherwise be forced to use second-raters rather than men
of outstanding competence. Only if they are being required to abandon an
old activity before taking on a new one will they be able to put on the
job the really first-rate people in the group.</p>
<p>Advisory and teaching activities should never “operate.” A common
weakness of per- sonnel staffs is that they operate. They run the labor
negotiations, they do a lot of house- keeping chores such as managing
the cafeteria, or they train. As a result the advisory and teaching work
does not get done. The “daily crisis” in “operations” takes precedence
over the work of advice and teaching which can always be postponed.
Mixing advice and op- erations means building large staffs rather than
building performance.</p>
<p>Other service staffs are just as guilty of mixing “doing” work in
with advice and teach- ing—and thereby shifting either the one or the
other.</p>
<p>A company may have need for acoustics engineering while no division,
however, has enough work in the area to justify its own acoustics
engineers. It seems logical therefore to put a few good acoustics
engineers into “manufacturing services” or “engineering ser- vices.” The
acoustics people, however, are not service staff but result-producers
who go to work wherever, in a given division, an acoustics job is to be
done. They are not ex- pected to give advice or to teach, but to do. If
placed into a services component the unit will rarely produce. The good
people in it will become frustrated and are unlikely to stay long.</p>
<p>If “joint-operating work” is needed—and it often is—there might be a
separate central operating pool under one manager for all such work,
regardless of technical area. The management problems in all joint
operating work are the same: relations, assignments, priorities, and
standards.</p>
<p>Advisory and teaching activities are service institutions, as
discussed in Chapters 11 through 14. They should be required to impose
on themselves the self-discipline of setting objectives, of setting
targets, of determining priorities and measuring their results against
them. They should not have a monopoly. If consulting or teaching work
has to be done other than in their areas of concentration somebody from
the outside should be brought in to do it. And insofar as possible,
their “customers,” the managers of the various units, should have the
choice between using the internal advisory and teaching staff, going on
the outside, or not using any staff at all.</p>
<p>Advisory and teaching work should not be a career. It is work to
which a manager or career professional should be exposed in the course
of his growth. But it is not work</p>
<p>which a man should, normally, do for long. As a career it corrupts.
It breeds contempt for “those dumb operating people,” that is, for
honest work. It puts a premium on being “bright,” rather than on being
right. It is also frustrating work because one does not have results of
one’s own but results only at secondhand.</p>
<p>But it is excellent training, excellent development, and a severe
test of a man’s charac- ter and of his ability to be effective without
having the authority of command. It is an ex- perience everyone should
have had who rises to the top of an organization. But it is an exposure
no one should suffer for more than a limited period of time.</p>
<p>There is constant discussion these days whether this kind of work
requires a high de- gree of specialized knowledge or whether a good
“generalist” can rapidly acquire enough of a “smattering of ignorance”
to be effective in advisory and teaching work. The debate rages forever
in any consulting practice. There is no answer to the question—indeed,
it is probably the wrong question. In some areas, clearly, professional
and highly specialized competence is a requirement. If a company, for
instance, needs advice and teaching in advanced areas of polymer
chemistry or in structuring highly complex and risky interna- tional
capital transactions, somebody with a background in marketing or in
purchasing need not apply, no matter how good and perceptive a teacher
he is. But in many areas of advice and teaching the generalist who is
willing to learn, who will think through the rela- tionship with his
“client,” and who takes responsibility for his contribution, is likely
to do a better job than the highly specialized expert who refuses to
make himself understood and is contemptuous of the “laity” who do not
possess his advanced expertise. Indeed, in most successful advisory and
teaching activities, the expert is the “inside” man who fur- nishes the
tools for the consultants, but who is not himself active, let alone
effective, in advising and teaching work.</p>
<p>The Two Faces of Information</p>
<p>Information activities present a special organizational problem. In
the terms the chemist uses, they are “bi-valent”; they have two faces,
two dimensions, and require two different “bonds.” Unlike most other
result-producing activities, they are not concerned with one stage of
the process but with the entire process itself. This means that they
have to be both centralized and decentralized.</p>
<p>Information-producing activities, whether accounting work or
operations research, re- semble the nervous system of a biological
organism which is also both centralized and decentralized down to the
smallest and most remote cell in the body.</p>
<p>Information activities therefore have two organizational homes rather
than one. The traditional organization chart expresses this in the two
different lines that connect an in- formation activity to “bosses”: a
solid line to the head of the unit for which it is the infor- mation
provider, and a dotted line to the central information group, for
instance, the com- pany controller. One conclusion from this is that
information work should be kept sepa- rate from other kinds of work.</p>
<p>American business has typically violated this rule by putting
accounting, i.e., a tradi- tional information activity, into one
component with the treasurer, i.e., the result- producing operating work
of supplying capital and managing money in the business. The
justification has been that both “deal with money.” But, of course,
accounting does not deal with money; it deals with figures. The
consequence of the traditional approach has been the slighting of
financial management. As long as money was—or seemed—cheap this could he
excused; but the excuse no longer holds.</p>
<p>The tough question with respect to information activities is which of
them belong to- gether and which should be kept apart. There is much
talk today about “integrated total information systems.” This of course
implies that all—or at least most—information ac- tivities should be in
one component. Insofar as this means that new and different informa-
tion activities, e.g., operations research or a computer system, should
not be subordinated to traditional accounting, the point is well taken.
But should they be coordinated? Or should they be separate?</p>
<p>There is, so far, no clear answer and no satisfactory way to organize
information work—though it is clearly a key activity. Nobody has yet
seen a total information system. No one may ever see one. But as we
develop information capacity we will have to grapple with the
organizational problem and will have to find answers, or at least
approaches.</p>
<p>Hygiene and Housekeeping</p>
<p>The last group of activities according to their contribution are
hygiene and housekeeping activities. They should be kept separate from
other work, or else they will not get done. The problem is not that
these activities are particularly difficult. Some are. Many others are
not. The problem is that they are not even indirectly related to
results. Therefore, they tend to be looked down upon by the rest of the
organization. They are “donkey work” because they are neither
result-producing nor professional work.</p>
<p>One reason for the tremendous increase in health-care costs in the
U.S. is managerial neglect of the “hotel services” by the people who
dominate the hospital, such as doctors and nurses. They all know that
the hotel services are essential and that patients do not get well
unless they are reasonably comfortable, are being fed have their beds
changed and their rooms cleaned. But these are not professional
activities for a medical man, for a nurse, or for an X-ray technician.
They are not willing to yield an inch to make it possible for the people
in charge of the hotel services to do their jobs. They are not willing
to have these activities represented on the upper levels of hospital
management. As a result, no “respectable” manager in a hospital wants to
have anything to do with these activities. They are left unmanaged. And
this means they are done badly and expensively.</p>
<p>There rarely is such a problem with the medical department within a
company—if only because our value system respects the doctor and places
him high in our social hier- archy. But even so important a function as
the selection of a plant site, or the construction of a plant are often
considered “extraneous” by the people within a business. Activities
where less seems to be at stake, whether the parking lot, the cafeteria,
or maintenance in general, tend to be slighted and neglected.</p>
<p>This extends even to activities in which a great amount of money is
at stake. Very few companies in the United States for instance have done
even an adequate job of managing the pension funds of their employees,
despite the enormous amount of money involved and the serious impact on
the company’s future. It is an activity which does not, it seems, have
any relationship to results and therefore it is an activity which tends
to be relegated to somebody else.</p>
<p>One way out is to turn hygiene and housekeeping activities over to
the work commu- nity to run (see Chapter 21). They are activities “for”
the employees and they are there- fore best managed by the employees.
Or, such activities may be farmed out to somebody whose business it is
to run a pension fund or to manage a cafeteria.</p>
<p>But insofar as a company’s management has to do these things
itself—and picking a plant site and building a factory is something a
company has to do for itself, or at least has to participate in
actively—hygiene and housekeeping activities ought to be kept separate
from all others. They require different people, different values,
different measurements— and should require little supervision by
business management itself.</p>
<p>One example are the autonomous real estate management companies which
large businesses have created to handle everything concerned with the
procurement of real es- tate, the construction of a building or a
factory, and the management and maintenance of buildings. Another
example is the General Services Administration of the U.S. Govern- ment,
which handles all housekeeping tasks for all government agencies. For
the senior soil scientist in the Department of Agriculture, managing the
automotive fleet for his unit is a chore for which he has neither
interest nor respect. Yet there obviously is a good deal of money at
stake—and cars need organized, systematic purchasing and organized, sys-
tematic maintenance. For the General Services Administration the
administration of the government automotive fleet is its business and
can be organized as such.</p>
<p>There is one overall rule. Activities that make the same kind of
contribution can be joined together in one component and under one
management, whatever their technical specialization. Activities that do
not make the same kind of contribution do not, as a rule,</p>
<p>belong together.</p>
<p>It is entirely feasible—indeed, it often is the best way—to put all
advising and teach- ing activities, in personnel, in manufacturing, in
marketing, or in purchasing, in one “ser- vices” group under one
manager. Similarly, in any but large companies, one man might well be
the company’s conscience in major conscience areas. Contribution rather
than</p>
<p>skill determines function.</p>

<p>I</p>
<p>DENTIFYING KEY ACTIVITIES and analyzing their contributions defines
the build- ing blocks of organization. But to place the structural units
which make up the organi- zation requires two additional pieces of work:
an analysis of decisions and an analysis of relations.</p>
<p>Decision Analysis</p>
<p>What decisions are needed to obtain the performance necessary to
attain objectives? What kinds of decisions are they? On what level of
the organization should they be made? What activities are involved in,
or affected by them? Which managers must therefore participate in the
decisions—at least to the extent of being consulted beforehand? Which
managers must be informed after they have been made? The answers to
these questions very largely determine where certain work belongs.</p>
<p>It will be argued that it is impossible to anticipate what kinds of
decisions will arise in the future. But while their content cannot be
predicted their kind and subject matter have a high degree of
predictability.</p>
<p>In one large company well over 90 percent of the decisions that
managers had to make over a five-year period were found to be “typical,”
and fell within a small number of cate- gories. In only a few cases
would it have been necessary to ask, “Where does this decision belong?”
had the problem been thought through in advance. Yet, because there was
no decision analysis, almost three-quarters of the decisions had to “go
looking for a home,” as the graphic phrase within the company put it,
and most of them went to a much higher level of management than was
needed. The company’s components had been placed ac- cording to the size
of their payroll rather than according to their decision responsibility
so that the activities that should have made key decisions were placed
so low as to be with- out authority and also without adequate
information.</p>
<p>To place authority and responsibility for various kinds of decisions
requires first that they be classified according to kind and character.
Such standard classifications as “policy decisions” and “operating
decisions” are practically meaningless, however, and give rise to
endless debates of a highly abstruse nature. Not much more helpful is
classification according to the amount of money involved.</p>
<p>There are four basic characteristics which determine the nature of
any business deci- sion.</p>
<p>First, there is the degree of futurity in the decision. For how long
into the future does it commit the company? And how fast can it be
reversed?</p>
<p>The buyer at Sears, Roebuck has practically no limit as to the amount
to which he can commit the company. But no buyer or buying supervisor
can either abandon an existing product or add a new one without the
approval of the head of the entire buying operation who, traditionally,
is the number two or number three man in the entire Sears, Roebuck
organization. Similarly, the foreign exchange trader in a major
commercial bank tradi- tionally has only the loosest limit on the
amounts to which he can commit the bank. But he cannot start trading in
a new currency without approval from high authority in the bank. And he
cannot carry a “position” regardless of amount, beyond a fixed and short
period of time.</p>
<p>The second criterion is the impact a decision has on other functions,
on other areas, or on the business as a whole. If it affects only one
function, it is of the lowest order. Other- wise it will have to be made
on a higher level, where the impact on all affected functions can be
considered; or it must be made in close consultation with the managers
of the other affected functions. To use technical language,
“Optimization” of process and performance of one function or area must
not be at the expense of other functions or areas; this is un- desirable
“sub-optimization.”</p>
<p>One example of a decision which looks like a purely “technical” one
affecting one area only, but which actually has impact on many areas, is
a change in the methods of keeping the parts inventory in a
mass-production plant. This affects all manufacturing operations. It
makes necessary major changes in assembly. It affects delivery to
custom- ers—it might even lead to radical changes in marketing and
pricing, such as the aban- donment of certain designs and models and of
certain premium prices. And it may require substantial changes in
engineering design. The technical problems in inventory-keeping— though
quite considerable—pale into insignificance compared to the problems in
other areas which any change in inventory-keeping will produce. To
“optimize” inventory- keeping at the expense of these other areas cannot
be allowed. It can be avoided only if the decision is recognized as
belonging to a fairly high order and handled as one affecting the entire
process: either it has to be reserved for management higher than the
plant; or it requires close consultation among all functional
managers.</p>
<p>The consideration of the impact of a decision and the need to prevent
“sub- optimization” may shift the focus of a decision decisively, as the
following example shows.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Du Pont Company, when it was still solely an
explosives manufacturer, the company was by far the world’s largest
buyer of nitrate, without, how- ever, owning any nitrate fields. Yet the
purchasing department was given a completely free hand in buying
nitrate. It did so, indeed, most successfully—from the point of view of
purchasing. It bought nitrate when the market prices were low and
succeeded in obtaining the vital raw material for the company at prices
far below what the competitors usually had to pay. Yet this was
sub-optimization. For the low prices for nitrate and the resulting
competitive cost advantage were paid for by tying up large sums of money
in inventory. This, in the first place, meant that a good deal of the
cost advantage of low nitrate prices was illusory and offset by high
interest payments. More serious, it also meant that the company, in the
event of a downturn in business, might find itself in a liquidity
crisis. The decision to balance cheap raw material prices against the
cost of money and the danger of illiquidity was therefore properly made
as a top-management decision. But after the new limits for inventory had
been established, the buying decisions again became exclusively the task
of the purchasing people.</p>
<p>The character of a decision is also determined by the number of
qualitative factors that enter into it: basic principles of conduct,
ethical values, social and political beliefs, etc. The moment value
considerations have to be taken into account, the decision moves into a
higher order and requires either determination or review at a higher
level. And the most important , as well as the most common of
qualitative factors are human beings. (This, of course, underlies the
strong recommendation in Chapter 36 for top-management</p>
<p>people to play an active part in the decisions on promotion to upper
levels of middle man- agement.)</p>
<p>Finally, decisions can be classified according to whether they are
periodically recur- rent or rare, if not unique, decisions. The
recurrent decision requires the establishment of a general rule, that
is, of a decision in principle. Since suspending an employee deals with
a person, the rule has to be decided at a fairly high level in the
organization. But the ap- plication of the rule to the specific case,
while also a decision, can then be placed on a much lower level.</p>
<p>The rare decision, however, has to be treated as a distinct event.
Whenever it occurs, it has to be thought through.</p>
<p>A decision should always be made at the lowest possible level and as
close to the scene of action as possible. However, a decision should
always be made at a level insur- ing that all activities and objectives
affected are fully considered. The first rule tells us how far down a
decision should be made. The second how far down it can be made, as well
as which managers must share in the decision and which must be informed
of it. The two together tell us where certain activities should be
placed. Managers should be high enough to have the authority needed to
make the typical decisions pertaining to their work; and low enough to
have the detailed knowledge and the first-hand experience, “where the
action is.”</p>
<p>Relations Analysis</p>
<p>The final step in designing the building blocks of organizations is
an analysis of relations. It tells us where a specific component
belongs.</p>
<p>With whom will a manager in charge of an activity have to work, what
contribution does he have to make to managers in charge of other
activities, and what contribution do these managers, in turn, have to
make to him?</p>
<p>The basic rule in placing an activity within the organization
structure is to impose on it the smallest possible number of
relationships. At the same time, it should be so placed that the crucial
relations, that is, the relationship on which depend its success and the
ef- fectiveness of its contribution, should be easy, accessible, and
central to the unit. The rule is to keep relationships to a minimum but
make each count.</p>
<p>This rule explains why functions are not, as traditional organization
theory would have them be, “bundles of related skills.” If we followed
that logic, we would, for instance, put production planning into a
planning component in which all kinds of planners would work together.
The skills needed in production planning are closely related to all
other opera- tional planning skills. Instead we put the production
planner into manufacturing and as close as possible both to the plant
manager and to the first-line supervisors. This is where he belongs
according to his relationship.</p>
<p>There is often a conflict between placement according to decision
analysis and place- ment according to relations analysis. By and large,
one should try to follow the logic of relations as far as he can.</p>
<p>If organization design has to follow the logic of decisions in order
to avoid sub- optimization (as is usually the case with respect to the
accounting function) the work itself should be planned according to
relations analysis, that is, as close as possible to the scene of
action. The direction of the work, the setting of rules, of standards,
but also the ap- praisal and evaluation of the work should be placed
according to decision analysis in a central component which can see the
entire business and think through the impacts.</p>
<p>The four analyses—on key activities, of contributions, of decisions,
of relations— should always be kept as simple and as brief as possible.
In a small enterprise they can often be done in a matter of hours and on
a few pieces of paper. In a very large and com- plex enterprise, though,
such as General Electric, the First National City Bank, or Unile- ver
(not to mention the Department of Defense) the job may well require
months of study and the application of highly advanced tools of analysis
and synthesis. But these analyses</p>
<p>should never be slighted or skimped. They should be considered a
necessary task and one that has to be done well in every business.</p>
<p>Symptoms of Malorganization</p>
<p>There is no perfect organization. At its best an organization
structure will not cause trou- ble. But what are the most common
mistakes in designing the building blocks of organiza- tion and joining
them together? And what are the most common symptoms of serious flaws in
organization?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The most common and the most serious symptom of malorganization is
multiplica- tion of the number of management levels. A basic rule of
organization is to build the least possible number of management levels
and forge the shortest possible chain of command.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every additional level makes more difficult the attainment of common
direction and mutual understanding. Every additional level distorts
objectives and misdirects attention. Mathematical “information theory”
has a law that any additional relay in a communica- tions system halves
the “message” and doubles the “noise.” Any “level” in an organiza- tion
is a “relay.” Every link in the chain sets up additional stresses and
creates one more source of inertia, friction, and slack.</p>
<p>Every additional level, especially in the big business, adds to the
difficulty of develop- ing tomorrow’s managers, both by adding to the
time it takes to come up from the bottom and by making specialists
rather than managers out of the men moving up through the chain.</p>
<p>In some large companies there are today twelve or even fifteen levels
between first- line supervisor and company president. Assuming that a
man gets appointed first-line su- pervisor at age twenty-five, and that
he spends only five years on each intervening level— both optimistic
assumptions—he would be eighty or ninety before he could even be con-
sidered for the company’s presidency. And the usual “cure”—a special
promotion ladder for hand-picked young “geniuses” or “crown princes”—is
as bad as the disease.</p>
<p>How few levels are really needed is shown by the example of the
oldest, largest, and most successful organization of the West, the
Catholic Church. There is only one level of authority and responsibility
between the Pope and the lowliest parish priest: the bishop.</p>
<p>The second most common symptom of malorganization is recurrence of
organiza- tional problems. No sooner has a problem supposedly been
“solved” than it comes back again in a new guise.</p>
<p>A typical example in a manufacturing company is product development.
The market- ing people think it belongs to them, the research and
development people are equally con- vinced that it belongs to them. But
placing it in either component simply creates a recur- ring problem.
Actually both placements are wrong. In a business that wants innovation,
product development is a key activity and a revenue-producing activity.
It should not be subordinated to any other activity. It deserves to be
organized as a separate innovative component.*</p>
<p>The recurrent organization problem indicates unthinking application
of traditional “organization principles” such as that of the “typical
function” or that of “staff and line.” The answer lies in making the
right analyses—the key-activities analysis, the contribu- tions
analysis, the decisions analysis, and the relations analysis. An
organization problem that comes back more than a couple of times should
not be treated mechanically by shuf- fling little boxes on a piece of
paper. It indicates lack of thinking, lack of clarity, and lack of
understanding.</p>
<p>Equally common and equally dangerous is an organization structure
that puts the at- tention of key people on the wrong, the irrelevant,
the secondary problems. Organization should put the attention of people
on major business decisions, on key activities, and on performance and
results. If, instead, it puts attention on proper behavior, on
etiquette, on</p>
<p>*On this see Chapter 61, “The Innovative Organization.”</p>
<p>procedure, let alone on jurisdictional conflict, organization
misdirects. Then organization becomes a bar to performance.</p>
<p>Again, this is the result of mechanical rather than organic
organization building. It is the result of slapping on so-called
principles, instead of thinking through what organiza- tion the strategy
of the business demands. It is the result of focusing organization on
symmetry rather than on performance.</p>
<p>No organization chart is likely ever to be displayed in a major art
museum. What mat- ters is not the chart but the organization. A chart is
nothing but an oversimplification which enables people to make sure that
they talk about the same things in discussing or- ganization structure.
One never makes organizational changes for the sake of the chart. This
always results in malorganization.</p>
<p>There are a number of common symptoms of poor organization which,
usually, re- quire no further diagnosis. There is, first, the symptom of
too many meetings attended by too many people.</p>
<p>There are, especially in large organizations, managerial organs which
do their work in and by meetings. The top committees in General Motors
are examples. And so are the boards of directors composed of the top
officers which govern both Standard Oil of New Jersey and Du Pont. But
these are exceptions—deliberative organs which do not have operating
functions and, as a rule, do not have decision-making functions either.
They are organs to guide, to reflect, to review—and perhaps their most
important function is to compel the operating top managers who sit down
with the committee to think through their own direction, their own
needs, and their own opportunities.</p>
<p>But apart from such deliberative bodies, which discharge their
functions in meetings, meetings should be considered as a concession to
organizational imperfection. The ideal is the organization which can
operate without meetings—in the same sense in which the ideal of the
machine designer is to have only one moving part in his contraption. In
every human organization there is far too much need for cooperation,
coordination, and human relations to have to provide for additional
meetings. And the human dynamics of meetings are so complex as to make
them very poor tools for getting any work done.</p>
<p>Whenever executives, except at the very top level, spend more than a
fairly small frac- tion of their time—maybe a quarter or less—in
meetings, there is prima facie a case of malorganization. An excess of
meetings indicates that jobs have not been defined clearly, have not
been structured big enough, have not been made truly responsible. Also
the need for meetings indicates that the decisions and relations
analyses either have not been made at all or have not been applied. The
rule should be to minimize the need for people to get together to
accomplish anything.</p>
<p>An organization in which people are all the time concerned about
feelings and about what other people will like or will not like is not
an organization that has good human relations. On the contrary, it is an
organization that has very poor human relations. Good human relations,
like good manners, are taken for granted. Constant anxiety over other
people’s feelings is the worst kind of human relations.</p>
<p>An organization that suffers from this—and a great many do—can be
said unequivo- cally to suffer from overstaffing. It might be
overstaffed in terms of activities. Instead of focusing on key
activities, it tries to do a little bit of everything—especially in
advice and teaching activities. Or the individual activities are
overstaffed. It is in crowded rooms that people get on each other’s
nerves, poke their elbows into each other’s eyes, and step on each
other’s toes. Where there is enough distance they do not collide.
Overstaffed organi- zations create work rather than performance. They
also create friction, sensitivity, irrita- tion, and concern with
feelings.</p>
<p>It is a symptom of malorganization to rely on “coordinators,”
“assistants,” and other such whose job it is not to have a job. This
indicates that activities and jobs have been designed too narrowly, or
that activities and jobs, rather than being designed for one de- fined
result, are expected to do a great many parts of different tasks. It
usually indicates also that organizational components have been
organized according to skill rather than according to their place in the
process or according to their contribution. For skill always</p>
<p>contributes only a part rather than a result. And then one need a
coordinator or some other such non-job to put pieces together that
should never have been separated in the first place.</p>
<p>“Organizitis” as a Chronic Affliction</p>
<p>Some, indeed a good many, businesses, especially large and complex
ones suffer from the disease of “organizitis.” Everybody is concerned
with organization. Reorganization is going on all the time. At the first
sign of any trouble, be it only a spat over a specification between a
purchasing agent and the people in engineering, the cry goes up for the
“or- ganization doctors,” whether outside consultants or inside staff.
And no organizational solution ever lasts long, indeed few
organizational arrangements are even given enough time to be tested and
worked out in practice, before another organization study is put in
train.</p>
<p>In some cases this does indeed suggest malorganization. “Organizitis”
will set in if or- ganization structure fails to come to grips with
fundamentals. It is, especially, the result of not rethinking and
restructuring the organization when there is a fundamental change in the
size and complexity of a business or in its objectives and strategy.</p>
<p>But just as often “organizitis” is self-inflicted and a form of
hypochondria. It therefore should be emphasized that organizational
change should not be undertaken often and should not be undertaken
lightly. Reorganization is a form of surgery; and even minor surgery has
risks.</p>
<p>The demands for organization studies or for reorganization as a
response to minor ailments should be resisted. No organization will ever
be perfect. A certain amount of friction, of incongruity, of
organizational confusion is inevitable.</p>
<p>The last two chapters have dealt with the “engineering” aspects of
organization: the building blocks, their placement, and their
relationships. But organization also needs “ar- chitecture”; it needs
structural logic and structural principles. It also calls for
understand- ing of the requirements organization structure needs to
satisfy, i.e., of “design specifica- tions.”</p>
<h4 id="design-logics-and-design-specifications">44 Design Logics and
Design Specifications</h4>
<p>The Five “Design Principles”—Is an Additional One Still
Unknown?—Limitations and Requirements—Formal
Specifications—Clarity—Economy—The Direction of Vi- sion—Understanding
of Task—Decision-Making—Stability and Adaptability— Perpetuation and
Self-Renewal—Operating, Innovative, Top-Management Structures</p>
<p>HE i.e.,</p>
<p>“ORGANIZATION ARCHITECT” has available today five design principles,
five distinct organization structures for the placement of activities
and the order-</p>
<p>ing of the relationships. Two of them are traditional and have been
known as princi- ples of organization design for many years: Henri
Fayol’s functional structure, and Alfred</p>
<p>P. Sloan’s federal decentralization.</p>
<p>Three are new, are indeed so new that they are not generally known,
let alone recog- nized as design principles: team organization;
“simulated” decentralization; and the “sys- tem” structure.</p>
<p>Each of these five was developed empirically and for specific needs.
The first impres- sion is therefore that they represent expediency
rather than design, let alone logic.* But, in reality, these designs
express different design logics. Each takes one generic dimension of
managerial organization and builds the structure around it.</p>
<p>Design Logics</p>
<p>Work and task are surely a generic dimension of management. And two
of the available design principles are structured around work and task:
the functional principle and the team.</p>
<p>These two differ in the way they balance “static” and “moving” parts.
In the functional organization “stages of the work,” e.g., manufacturing
and marketing, and “skills,” e.g., accounting, are designed as static;
the “work” moves from one to the others. In team structure the work is
conceived as static with “skills,” that is, individual manufacturing,
marketing, and accounting experts moving to form the specific team which
a specific piece of work, i.e., a “task,” requires.</p>
<p>Functional organization and team organization are commonly assumed to
be anti- thetic, with the “modern” team being opposed to the
“old-fashioned” function.</p>
<p>That the team is not “free-form” but a highly disciplined and highly
structured form, has been said earlier (in Chapter 41). But the belief
that these two are opposite is largely misunderstanding. In fact, they
are not even alternatives. For a number of design prob- lems one of the
two is the only appropriate design principle. For the biggest
organization problem, the structure of knowledge work, the two are
complementary.</p>
<p>Results and performance are as much a true dimension of management as
work and task. The two “decentralization” principles available, “federal
decentralization” and</p>
<p>*This was expressed most cogently by one of the most respected
organization theorists, Harold Koontz, in his article, “The Management
Theory Jungle.” Journal of the Academy of Management, December,
1965.</p>
<p>“simulated decentralization,” are built around this dimension. They
are “result-focused” designs.</p>
<p>Unlike functional and team structures they are, however, not
complementary. They are not even alternatives. Federal decentralization
is an “optimum,” simulated decentraliza- tion a “lesser evil” to be
resorted to only when the stringent requirements of federal de-
centralization cannot be met.</p>
<p>Relationships are also a generic dimension of management. The last of
the available design principles, “systems designs,” is
relations-focused.</p>
<p>Relations are inevitably both more numerous and less clearly
definable than either work and task, or results. A relations-focused
structure will therefore, of necessity, be both highly complex and
lacking in clarity. It will present greater difficulties than either
work-focused or result-focused design. But there are, as we shall see,
organizational prob- lems where the very complexity of relationships
makes “systems design” the only appro- priate design principle.</p>
<p>This rough classification indicates that at least one additional
design principle might yet be developed. Decision is as much a dimension
of management as are work and task, results and performance, and
relations. Yet so far we know no decision-focused design principle of
organization structure.* So far we have only theoretical speculation.
But a decision-focused design principle is at least a theoretical
possibility. If it were to be de- veloped into an operationally usable
structure, it might have considerable impact.</p>
<p>Because each of the available design principles structures around one
dimension of a multidimensional entity, management, each must have
limitations. Each must be the best available design principle for
certain structural tasks; usable, though with increasing inef- ficiency,
for others; and just plain wrong for yet a third group. Each must also
have its own requirements and make its own demands on management and
enterprise.</p>
<p>Formal Specifications</p>
<p>Any “structure,” by definition, has to satisfy requirements that have
nothing to do with the purpose of the structure but are grounded in the
nature of structure itself. Structures are “forms”; and forms have to
satisfy “formal” specifications.</p>
<p>Organization structure specifically needs to satisfy minimum
requirements with re- spect to: clarity; economy; the direction of
vision; understanding by the individual of his own task and the task of
the whole; decision-making; stability and adaptability; and per-
petuation and self-renewal.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Clarity. Each managerial component, and each individual within the
organization, especially each manager, needs to know where he belongs,
where he stands, where he has to go for whatever is needed, whether
information, cooperation, or decision, and how to get there. Clarity is
by no means the same thing as simplicity. Indeed, structures that look
simple may lack clarity. And seemingly complex structures may have great
clarity.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Gothic cathedral has great clarity; the modern office building
has practically none. In the Gothic cathedral everyone knows, without
being told, where he stands and where to go. Even someone ignorant of
the mysteries of the Christian religion would know immediately what the
purpose of the building is and how to relate to it. Yet the Gothic
cathedral is exceedingly complex, an expression of highly abstract
principles of metaphysics and esthetics, and endowed with a wealth of
adornments, allusions, and sym- bols. By contrast, the modern office
building is as simple as a structure can be: an assem- blage of cubes.
Yet no one in the modern office building can find his way without
instruc- tions—and even then it is easy to become confused.</p>
<p>A structure in which no one knows wittout an elaborate organization
manual where he belongs, where he has to go, and where he stands,
creates friction, wastes time, causes</p>
<p>*Herbert A. Simon and his school have been attempting to develop one.
At least this is how I read H. A. Simon, Administrative Behavior
(Macmillan, 1957 and J.G. March and H.A. Simon, Organization (John Wiley
andandandand Sons, 1958).</p>
<p>bickering and frustration, delays decision, and is altogether an
impediment, rather than a help.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Economy. Closely related to clarity is the requirement of economy.
The minimum effort should be needed to control, to supervise, and to
coax people to perform. Organiza- tion structure should make possible
self-control and should encourage self-motivation. And the smallest
possible number of people, especially of people of high-performance
capacity, should have to devote time and attention to keeping the
machinery going, i.e., to “management” and “organization,” to “internal
control,” “internal communications,” and “personnel problems.”</li>
</ol>
<p>In any organization some of the effort has to be directed inward,
some of it has to be used to keep the organization running and in good
repair. In organization as well as in physics, perpetual motion is not
possible; some “friction” is inevitable. But the less of the input of
the organization has to be used to keep it going or to lubricate the
friction points, the more of the input can become output, the more
economical the organization will be, and the more of its “inputs” can
become performance.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The direction of vision. Organization structure should direct the
vision of individu- als and of managerial units toward performance
rather than toward efforts. And it should direct vision toward results,
that is, toward the performance of the entire enterprise.</li>
</ol>
<p>Performance is the end which all activities serve. Indeed,
organization can be likened to a transmission belt that converts
activities into the one “drive”—performance. Organi- zation is the more
efficient the more “direct” the transmission is, that is, the less it
has to change the speed and direction of individual activities to make
them result in perform- ance. The largest possible number of managers
should perform as businessmen rather than as “experts” or “bureaucrats,”
should be tested against business performance and results rather than
primarily by standards of administrative skill or professional
competence.</p>
<p>Organization structure must not misdirect vision toward the wrong
performance. It should not encourage managers to give major attention to
the old and easy, but tired, products and businesses while slighting the
new and growing, though perhaps difficult, products. It must discourage
the tendency to cling to unprofitable products and businesses by letting
them ride on the coattails of the profitable lines. It must not make
effort more important than results and craftsmanship an end in itself.
It must, in brief, make for will- ingness and ability to work for
results rather than for the sake of the work itself, to work for the
future rather than rest on the achievements of the past, and to strive
for strength rather than to put on fat.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Understanding one’s own task and the common task. An organization
should en- able each individual, especially each manager and each
professional—but also each managerial component—to understand his own
task.</li>
</ol>
<p>This, of course, means that the work itself has to be specialized.
Work is always spe- cific. And one can understand only a task that can
be defined, a task in which what is needed to accomplish it is inherent
in the task itself.</p>
<p>But at the same time, an organization should enable everyone to
understand the com- mon task, the task of the entire organization. Each
member of the organization, in order to relate his efforts to the common
good, needs to understand how his task fits in with the task of the
whole and, in turn, what the task of the whole implies for his own task,
his own contribution, his own direction. Communications therefore need
to be helped rather than hampered by organizational structure.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Decision-making. None of the available design principles is
primarily structured around a “decision model.” Yet decisions have to be
made, made on the right issues and at the right level, and have to be
converted into work and accomplishment. An organiza- tion design,
therefore, needs to be tested as to whether it impedes or strengthens
the deci- sion-making process.</li>
</ol>
<p>A structure that forces decisions to go to the highest possible level
of organization rather than be settled at the lowest possible level is
clearly an impediment, and so is a decision structure that obscures the
emergence of the need for crucial decisions, or fo- cuses attention on
the wrong issues, such as jurisdictional disputes.</p>
<p>A decision is only good intention until it has been carried out in
work and action and has become accomplishment. No organization structure
by itself can make sure of this. But different structures can make it
more or less difficult for decisions to become organ- izational
commitment and individual work.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Stability and adaptability. An organization needs a substantial
degree of stability. It must be able to do its work even though the
world around it is in turmoil. It must be able to build on its
performance and achievement of yesterday. It needs to be able to plan
for its own future and continuity.</li>
</ol>
<p>The individual needs also a “home.” Nobody gets any work done in a
railroad station waiting room; no one gets much work done as a
transient. The individual needs to belong to a “community” in which he
knows people, in which he is known by them, and in which his own
relationship is anchored.</p>
<p>But stability is not rigidity. On the contrary, organization
structure requires a high de- gree of adaptability. A totally rigid
structure is not stable; it is brittle. Only if the structure can adapt
itself to new situations, new demands, new conditions—and also to new
faces and personalities—will it be able to survive. Adaptability is a
major requirement there- fore.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Perpetuation and self-renewal. Finally, an organization needs to be
able to per- petuate itself. It needs to be able to provide for its
self-renewal. These two needs entail a number of demands.</li>
</ol>
<p>An organization must be capable of producing from within tomorrow’s
leaders. One minimum requirement for this is, as said in the preceding
chapter, that it must not have so many levels of management that an able
man, getting into a management job early, say at age twenty-five, cannot
normally reach the top rungs of the promotion ladder while still young
enough to be effective.</p>
<p>What matters are not the number of levels at the very top. Once a man
has been pro- moted to general officer in the armed services, he is “at
the top,” even though there are three or four different “ranks” of
generals. What matters is the number of “levels” to be traversed until a
man reaches what in his organization is considered “top management.”</p>
<p>But more important than the number of levels are the experience and
exposure the or- ganization structure provides or desires. Organization
structure should help each man learn and develop in each job he holds;
it should be designed for continuous learning.</p>
<p>One self-renewal specification is the ability of an organization
structure to prepare and test a man on each level for the next level
above, and especially to prepare and test to- day’s junior and middle
managers for senior and top-management positions. For perpetua- tion and
self-renewal it is further necessary for an organization structure to be
accessible to new ideas and to be willing and able to do new things.</p>
<p>Operating, Innovative, Top-Management Structures</p>
<p>These “formal” specifications apply to any organization structure: of
the small business and the large one; of the simple business and the
complex one; of business enterprise and of non-business service
institutions.</p>
<p>They also apply to the three different kinds of management that have
to be structured and organized: operating management responsible for
performing the work and for pro- ducing the results of today’s business;
innovative management responsible for creating the company’s tomorrow;
and top management capable of directing, of giving vision, and of
setting the course for the business of today and the business of
tomorrow.</p>
<p>These are clearly conflicting specifications. No design principle
could fully satisfy all of them. Any organization structure that is to
be capable of performance and continuity will however have to satisfy
all these specifications to some degree. This means, inevitably,
compromises, trade-offs, balancing. It also implies that several design
principles rather than one are likely to have to be used even for simple
organization. For if any one of these specifications goes totally
unsatisfied, the enterprise will not perform. Organization build-</p>
<p>ing therefore requires understanding of the available design
principles, their requirements, their limitations, and their “fit”
against the design specifications.</p>

Organization</p>
<p>All work, physical as well as mental, can be organized in three
ways.</p>
<p>It can be organized by stages in the process. In building a house we
first build the foundation, then the frame and the roof, and finally the
interior.</p>
<p>It can be organized so that the work moves where the skills and the
tools are for each of the steps required. The traditional metalworking
unique-product plant has batteries of reamers and lathes in one aisle,
stamping machines in another, heat treating equipment in a third, with
the pieces of metal moving from one group of tools and their skilled
opera- tors to another. Or, to give another example, the student at the
university—the “raw mate- rial” of the educational process—moves from
classroom to classroom, from professor to professor, from course to
course. Each professor in each course teaches only the subject of his
specialized skill, with the student emerging at the end as an “educated
man,” or at least as a diploma holder.</p>
<p>Finally, we can join together in a team workers with different skills
and different tools and move them to the work, which itself is
stationary. A movie-making crew—the direc- tor, the actors, the
electricians, the sound engineers— “goes on location.” Each does highly
specialized work; but they work as a team.</p>
<p>“Functional organization” is commonly described as organizing work
into “related bundles of skill.” Actually it uses both the stage
organization and the skill organization of work. Such traditional
functions as manufacturing or marketing comprise a very wide variety of
unrelated skills, viz., the machinist’s skill and the production
planner’s skill in manufacturing, and the salesman’s skill and the
market researcher’s skill in marketing. But manufacturing and marketing
are distinct stages in the process. Other functions, such as accounting
and personnel, are, however, organized by skills. But in any functional
or- ganization the work is moved to the stage or the skill. The work
moves, while the position of the worker is fixed.</p>
<p>In the team structure, however, work and task are, so to speak,
“fixed.” Workers with different skills and different tools are brought
together in a team or a task force and as- signed to a piece of work or
a job whether this is a research project or the architectural design of
a new office building.</p>
<p>Both functional structures and team are very old designs. The
Irrigation Cities of Mesopotamia and the Egyptian pyramid builder
organized work functionally. And the organized and permanent team of the
“hunting band” goes back even further, to the last Ice Age.</p>
<p>But as conscious, deliberate, designed structures, both are new.
Functional organiza- tion was defined and designed by Henri Fayol in the
early years of this century. The team is only now being recognized as a
design principle.</p>
<p>Work and task have to be structured and organized. Any organization
has to apply one or both of the design principles for work and task,
i.e., functional structure and team. Many, as will be discussed later in
this chapter, should apply both. And all organizations need to
understand both.</p>
<p>The Functional Structure</p>
<p>Functional design has the great advantage of clarity. Everybody has a
“home.” Everybody understands his own task. It is an organization of
high stability.</p>
<p>But the price for clarity and stability is that it is difficult for
anyone, up to and includ- ing the top functional people, to understand
the task of the whole and to relate their own work to it. While stable,
the structure is rigid and resists adaptation. It does not prepare
people for tomorrow, does not train and test them, and on the whole,
tends to confirm them in the desire to do a little better what they
already do, rather than to be receptive to new ideas and new ways of
doing things.</p>
<p>The strengths and the limitations of the functional principle give it
peculiar character- istics with respect to the economy specification. At
its best, functional organization works with high economy. Very few
people at the top need to spend much time on keeping the organization
running, that is, on “organizing,” “communications,” “coordination,”
“con- ciliation,” and so on. The rest can do their work. But at its
fairly common worst, func- tional organization is grossly uneconomical.
As soon as it approaches even a modest de- gree of size or complexity,
“friction” builds up. It rapidly becomes an organization of
misunderstandings, feuds, empires and Berlin-Wall building. It soon
requires elaborate, expensive, and clumsy management
crutches—coordinators, committees, meetings, trou- bleshooters, special
dispatchers—which waste everybody’s time without, as a rule, solv- ing
much. And this degenerative tendency prevails not only with respect to
relations be- tween different “functions.” The large functional unit
with its subdivisions and sub- functions is equally prone lo rapid
internal inefficiency and equally requires more and more managerial
effort devoted to its own internal running.</p>
<p>Another way of saying the same thing is that functional design, where
it applies, makes the least psychological demands on the people. They
are highly secure both in their work and in their relationships. When
it, however, is being used beyond fairly narrow limits of size and
complexity it creates emotional tensions, hostilities, and insecurities.
People will then tend to see themselves and their functions belittled,
besieged, attacked. They will come to see it as their first job to
defend their function, to protect it against ma- rauders in other
functions, to make sure “it doesn’t get pushed around.” “Nobody here
realizes that the company is being kept alive by us engineers” (or “us
salesmen” or “us accountants”) is a common complaint. And besting the
“wicked enemies” within will be- come sweeter victory than making the
business prosper. Precisely because functional de- sign demands from
functional people little responsibility for the performance and success
of the whole, a poorly working—or overextended—functional structure is
likely to make people both insecure and parochial.</p>
<p>The basic strength as well as the basic weakness of functional
organization is its ef- fort-focus. Every functional manager considers
his function the most important one. This</p>
<p>results in high emphasis on craftsmanship and professional standards.
But it also makes people in the functional unit prone to subordinate the
welfare of the other functions, if not of the entire business, to the
interests of their unit. There is no real remedy against this tendency
in the functional organization. The lust for aggrandizement on the part
of each function is the price paid for the laudable desire of each
manager to do a good job.</p>
<p>Communications are fairly good in the small functional organization.
They break down once the functional organization reaches even moderate
size. Even within the indi- vidual functional unit, e.g., the marketing
department, communications weaken if the unit becomes large or complex.
People are then increasingly specialists and interested primar- ily in
their own narrow specialty.</p>
<p>The most extreme example is the largest and most highly specialized
functional or- ganization around: the large university. But a large
manufacturing department or the commercial-loan department of a big bank
also resembles that well-known description of a large university faculty
as “a collection of anarchists held together by a common parking
lot.”</p>
<p>As a decision-making structure functional organization—even of fairly
small—works poorly. For decisions cannot, as a rule, be made except at
the highest level of a functional organization. No one except the man at
the top sees the entire business. As a result, deci- sions are also
easily misunderstood by the organization and are poorly implemented.
They are seen as “who is right” rather than as “what is right.” And
because a functional organi- zation has high stability but low
adaptability, the challenge to do something truly new and truly
different is likely to be suppressed rather than brought out in the open
and faced up to.</p>
<p>Functional organization also does poorly in developing, preparing,
and testing men.</p>
<p>Functional organization of necessity puts the major emphasis on a
man’s acquiring the knowledge and competence that pertain to it. Yet the
functional specialist may become narrow in his vision, his skills, and
his loyalties. In a functional organization there is a built-in emphasis
on not showing “unbecoming curiosity” about the work of other func-
tions or specialties, that is, on narrow departmentalization.</p>
<p>Moreover, functional organization tends to make a man unfit for
management— precisely because most of the emphasis is on functional
skill rather than on results and performance. Indeed the more highly
skilled functionally an organizational unit is, the less will it value
management, the less well will it prepare a man to be a manager.</p>
<p>French businesses tend to be most rigidly functional in their
structures. It is therefore perfectly logical that top management in
large French companies does not, as a rule, come out of the business
itself and tends to consider that a career in the company unfits a man
for a top-management position (see Chapter 35). But the fault is not in
the men; it is in using functional organization far beyond the size and
complexity for which it is appropri- ate.</p>
<p>Can the Weaknesses Be Offset?</p>
<p>These limitations and weaknesses of functional organization were
apparent from the very first. A good deal of thought has therefore been
given to attempts to offset them, and to offset in particular the
greatest weakness: the tendency of functional organization to mis-
direct the vision of functional people from contribution and results to
efforts and busy- ness.</p>
<p>The first attempt was made by Theodore Vail of the Bell Telephone
System (see Chapter 13). His “bogeys,” that is, the specific goals and
measurements which were de- veloped for functional work, were derived
from his overall business definition and from the business objectives of
the Telephone Company. While far from perfect and confusing by their
sheer number, they served for many years to direct the efforts of
functional man- agers toward performance and to give functional managers
an immediate “reading” of their contribution to key results.</p>
<p>But it is doubtful that anything like Vail’s system could be designed
for a functional system that is faced with complexity. A telephone
system, after all, has only one product. Until very recently it has had
only one market—and no competition. And while there have been great and
constant technical changes in telecommunications, what the customer
bought did, until recently, not change at all.</p>
<p>Vail’s feedback controls for a functional structure work, in other
words, for a monop- oly, whether private or governmental, with a single
product and one known market. There they are indeed the model—and this
is the situation of a good many, if not of most, non- business service
institutions, e.g., the hospital.</p>
<p>In the typical business, however, these conditions are not present.
And that a similar system of feedback controls for functional work can
be designed for the complex business enterprise seems unlikely; at least
no one has yet been able to do it.</p>
<p>The most comprehensive attempt so far has been made by GE which, for
the last sev- eral decades, has been working on developing performance
objectives for functional work. Yet all that has been accomplished, by
and large, is to work out “standards of good manufacturing work” or
“standards of good accounting work,” that is, standards focused on the
function itself rather than on its contribution to the whole.</p>
<p>Their Limited Scope</p>
<p>Even where functional organization applies, its scope is limited to
operating work. Top management is specific “work” (see Chapter 50), but
it is not “functional” work. And functional organization is the wrong
organization for it. Wherever applied, it has made for a weak top
management.</p>
<p>The large German company after 1900 tended to structure its top
management func- tionally; in many German companies this is still being
done. There was indeed a top- management team, the Vorstand of German
company law. But only one man, the General- Director, was concerned with
top-management work. The other members were the heads of the major
functions and concerned primarily with their areas. As a result, the
General- Director became an autocrat, and the Vorstand team degenerated
into legal fiction. Or there was no top management at all, with each
function going its own way.</p>
<p>The functional principle is even less applicable to innovating work
(see Chapter 61, “The Innovative Organization”). In innovation, we try
to do something we have not done before, that is, something we do not
yet know. We do need the individual skills of the various disciplines in
innovation. But we do not know where and when they will be needed, for
what time, in what degree, or in what volume. The innovative task
therefore cannot be organized on the basis of functional organization.
It is incompatible with it.</p>
<p>Where Functionalism Works</p>
<p>Functionalism works—and exceedingly well—in the kind of business for
which it was designed. The model for Henri Fayol’s functional design
early in this century was the coal-mining company he ran. It was a
fairly large business at that time but would be con- sidered a fairly
small business today. Except for a few engineers it employed only manual
workers who did one kind of work. A coal mine has only one product; only
sizes vary for different customers. Coal requires no treatment beyond
simple washing and sorting. Coal had, at least at that time, only three
markets—steel mills, power plants, and homeowners. And while the
technology of mining coal was changing fairly fast in Fayol’s day—when
he started out, explosives had not yet come into use and when he retired
mechanical coal cutters were already at work—the process itself did not
change at all. And all one can ever get out of a coal mine is coal.
There is not much scope for innovation.</p>
<p>Fayol’s company is the kind of business which the functional design
principle organ- izes well. Anything more complex, more dynamic, or more
entrepreneurial demands per- formance capacities which the functional
principle does not possess. If used beyond the limits of Fayol’s model,
functional structure rapidly becomes costly in terms of time and effort,
and runs a high risk of misdirecting the energies of the organization
away from</p>
<p>The Team</p>
<p>A team is a number of people—usually fairly small—with different
backgrounds, skills, and knowledge, and drawn from various areas of the
organization (their “home”) who work together on a specific and defined
task. There is usually a team leader or team cap- tain. His is often a
permanent appointment for the duration of the team’s assignment. But
leadership at any one time places itself according to the logic of the
work and the specific stage in its progress. There are no superiors and
subordinates; there are only seniors and juniors.</p>
<p>Every business—and every other institution—has been using teams all
along for ad hoc non-recurrent tasks. But we have only recently
recognized what our nomadic Ice Age ancestors knew—the team is also a
principle for permanent, structural design. The mis- sion of the team is
a specific task: the hunting expedition or product development. But the
team itself can be permanent. Its composition may vary from task to
task; its base re- mains, however, fairly constant even though
individual members may scatter between tasks or belong, at one and the
same time, to a number of teams.</p>
<p>Some Examples</p>
<p>Teams have become very popular and are indeed in danger of being
damaged by becom- ing fashionable. Countless books are being written on
“task forces,” “project teams,” “free-form organizations,” “small
groups,” and so on. A few examples will, however, show better than any
theoretical discussion what a team is, how it works, what its re-
quirements are, and what it cannot do.</p>
<p>The hospital may be the simplest example. The structural component in
the hospital is a team mobilized ad hoc from the “services” for the
needs of the individual patient as defined by the team captain, the
physician, with the nurse as the executive officer of the group.</p>
<p>In the hospital everyone directly concerned with patient care, that
is, everyone on the team, is supposed to take personal responsibility
for the success of the whole team’s ef- fort. The doctor’s orders are
law in a hospital. Yet a physical therapist who is told, for instance,
to give rehabilitation exercises to a patient is expected to notice if
the patient seems to run a fever, to stop the exercises, and to notify
the nurse immediately and ask for a temperature reading. He will not
hesitate to countermand a doctor’s orders within his own sphere. The
doctor may order an orthopedic patient to be measured for crutches and
taught how to use them. The physical therapist may take one look and
say, “You don’t need crutches; you’ll be better off using a cane right
away or just walking on your walking cast without any support.”</p>
<p>A business parallel to the example of the hospital is the
organization of a medium- sized European company which designs, makes,
and services plastic molds for several hundred customers, mostly large
companies such as the big automobile plants in the Common Market. In
this company, the work of making the molds is organized on strictly
functional lines. It is highly skilled but self-contained work. But mold
design, selling, and customer service, while shown on the organization
chart as functions, do not work as such. The individual mold designer
works as a member of a team—or of several teams— which is responsible
collectively for an individual customer or a number of customers. The
team leaders may come from any function—selling, service, or mold
design.</p>
<p>Performance responsibility rests with the team. Each team leader
draws on the re- sources of the whole organization as needed. At one
stage he brings in mold designers, at another, salesmen, at another
stage, customer-service people, and so on. Not even sales- men are
assigned permanently to customers; they are assigned to product lines.
But the</p>
<p>team leader who carries primary account responsibility will tend to
work again and again with the same three or four men in each functional
area. Each of them, in turn, considers himself as being “close” to three
or four of the teams—though a team leader often also calls on a
specialist whom he never before put on his team to handle a rare or new
prob- lem.</p>
<p>“It’s my job to decide that one of my accounts needs this or that
kind of service engi- neering,” said one account leader, himself a mold
designer. “Then it’s my job to bring in the right service engineer—a man
I know, trust, and can recommend to my customer. It’s then the service
engineer’s job to decide what needs to be done. And if he decides that
we have to redesign molds for the customer, then I have to go to work
and redesign molds until they satisfy the specifications for mold design
the service man lays down—he then becomes my ‘boss.’”</p>
<p>The same mold designer, in addition to heading the “account team” for
the company’s biggest and most profitable account, also considered
himself—and was considered by all the others—a member of two or three
other account teams. “They call me in, maybe half a dozen times a year,
when they have design problems that for them are fairly uncommon but are
daily occurrences on the account where I head the team,” the man
explains it. “And then I go to work for their team as a fairly junior
member and do whatever design- ing they need.”</p>
<p>Their Lessons</p>
<p>These two examples show that what characterizes a team is not “free
form” or the absence of regimentation. Teams at the plastic-mold company
are indeed highly flexible and with- out a rigid chain of command within
the team. Team leadership moves with the task. But few social
organizations around are as rigid as the hospital; a “rod” of command
rather than a chain of command characterizes hospital structure. Yet
both, the plastic-mold com- pany and the hospital, form and use genuine
teams.</p>
<p>Team design requires a continuing mission in which the specific tasks
change fre- quently, however. If there is no continuing mission, there
might be an ad hoc temporary task force—but not an organization based on
the team as a permanent design. If the tasks do not change, or if their
relative importance or sequence remain unchanged, there is no need for
team organization, and no point to it.</p>
<p>A team needs a clear and sharply defined objective. It must be
possible all the time to feed back from the objectives to the work and
performance of the whole team and of each member.</p>
<p>A task force needs leadership. It can be a permanent leader—physician
and nurse on the patient-care team in the hospital, or the recognized
head man on a top-management team. Or leadership can shift with each
major phase. But then, as in the mold-making company, one man needs to
be clearly designated to decide, at a given stage, who takes team
leadership for a particular phase of the task. It is not leadership
responsibility for making the decision and giving the command. It is
leadership responsibility for deciding who among the team members has,
for a particular phase and a particular challenge, the decision and
command authority (on this see also the discussion of the Japanese
approach to decision-making in Chapter 37). A team is therefore not
“democratic” if by that is meant that decisions are taken by vote. It
emphasizes authority. But the authority is task- derived and
task-focused.</p>
<p>It is always the team as a whole that is responsible for the task.
The individual con- tributes his particular skill and knowledge. But,
every individual is always responsible for the output and performance of
the entire team rather than only for his own work. The team is the
unit.</p>
<p>Team members need not know each other well to perform as a team. But
they do need to know each other’s function and potential contribution.
“Rapport,” “empathy,” “inter- personal relations” are not needed. Mutual
understanding of each other’s job and common understanding of the common
task are essential.</p>
<p>An example, is the team used to produce advertising or educational
movies.</p>
<p>In contrast to the teams used for TV programs or for large-scale
entertainment movies, crews for advertising or educational films are
usually composed of “freelancers” hired for one production, that is, for
anything from a few hours to a few weeks. Every director knows a dozen
technicians in each category—electricians, sound engineers, cameramen,
lighting people—with whom he has worked before and whom he trusts. He
knows of an- other half dozen men in each category and has heard good
things of them. Every one of the technicians; in turn, knows a number of
directors who meet his standards. But who is hired for a given
assignment depends on who is available at the time; and usually on very
short notice. As a result, the crew members often meet each other for
the first time a few minutes before production gets under way. Sometimes
they never learn each other’s names and address one other as “sound
engineer” or “lights” all the way through the as- signment. And yet they
immediately form a team. The director “calls the shots.” But the sound
engineer can and will stop the director and say, “I get a noise,” and
everything stops until the source of the noise is found and eliminated.
The cameramen can and will say, “I get a reflection off the wall,” and
everything stops until the lighting is adjusted. When the assignment is
over, the crew members go their own separate ways and may not meet again
for years. Yet while they belong to the same crew, they work closely
together as a team.</p>
<p>It is therefore the team leader’s first job to establish clarity:
clarity of objectives and clarity with respect to everybody’s role
including his own.</p>
<p>The Strengths and Limitations of the Team Principles</p>
<p>The team has obvious strengths. Everybody always knows the work of
the whole and holds himself responsible for it. It is highly receptive
to new ideas and new ways of doing things. And it has great
adaptability.</p>
<p>It also has great shortcomings. It does not possess clarity unless
the team leader cre- ates it. It has poor stability. Its economy is low;
a team demands continuing attention to its management, to the
relationships of people within the task force, to assigning people to
their jobs, to explanation, deliberation, communication, and so on. A
large part of the energy of all the members goes into keeping things
running. Although everybody on the team understands the common task, he
does not always understand his own specific task. He may be so
interested in what others are doing that he pays inadequate attention to
his own assignment.</p>
<p>Teams are adaptable. They are highly receptive to experimentation, to
new ideas, and to new ways of doing things. They are the best means
available for overcoming functional insulation and parochialism. Any
career professional should serve on a few teams during his working
life.</p>
<p>Still, teams do only a little better than straight functional
organization in preparing men for higher management responsibilities or
in testing them in performance. A team makes neither for clear
communications nor for clear decision-making. The whole group must work
constantly on explaining both to itself and to managers throughout the
rest of the organization what it is trying to do, what it is working on,
and what it has accom- plished. The team must constantly make sure that
the decisions that need to be made are brought into the open. These is
real danger otherwise that teams will make decisions they should not
make decisions, for instance, that irreversibly commit the whole
company.</p>
<p>In the plastic-mold company, for example, the “account teams” tend
all the time to make pricing decisions without telling anyone about
them. Yet, while meant for one cus- tomer only, these decisions
immediately affect the entire business.</p>
<p>Teams fail—and the failure rate has been high—primarily because they
do not impose on themselves the self-discipline and responsibility that
are required precisely because of the high degree of freedom team
organization gives. No task force can be “permissive” and function. This
is the reason why the same young educated people who clamor for</p>
<p>team work tend so often in reality to resist it. It makes tremendous
demands on self- discipline.</p>
<p>But the greatest limitation of the team structure is size. Teams work
best when there are few members. The aboriginal hunting band had seven
to fifteen members. So do the teams in team sports such as football,
baseball, and cricket. If a team gets much larger it becomes unwieldy.
Its strengths, such as flexibility and the sense of responsibility of
the members, attenuate. Its limitations—lack of clarity, communication
problems, over- concern with the internal mechanism and internal
relationship—become crippling weak- nesses.</p>
<p>The Scope of Team Organization</p>
<p>Its size limitation determines the scope of applicability of the team
principle of organiza- tion.</p>
<p>It is the best available design principle for top-management work.
Indeed (as will be discussed in Chapter 51) it is probably the only
appropriate design principle for top man- agement. Similarly, the team
is the preferred design principle for innovative work (see Chapter
61).</p>
<p>But for most operating work the team is not appropriate by itself and
alone as the de- sign principle of organization. It is a
complement—though a badly needed one. It may well be that it is team
organization that will make the functional principle fully effective and
will enable it to do what its designers had hoped for.</p>
<p>This may turn out to be the case with respect to mass-production work
(see Chapter 21). Mass production, especially “rigid” mass production,
is an extreme application of functional organization. Each man is a
“unit” with a specific function; and the work moves from one of these
human units of function to the next. Encouraging men to form teams
within the mass production system—as IBM has done for many years and as
some automobile plants are doing now—promises to result in both
productive work organized on the functional principle and in achieving
workers working in teams.</p>
<p>Team Design and Knowledge Organization</p>
<p>But the area where team design as a complement to functional
organization is likely to make the greatest contribution is in knowledge
work. The knowledge organization (see Chapter 35) is likely to balance
“function” as a man’s “home” with “team” as his “place of work.”</p>
<p>Knowledge work by definition is specialized work. The shift from
middle manage- ment to knowledge organization therefore brings into the
management group a host of specialists not as staff but as operating
people. The traditional pattern of typical functions is being replaced
by an enormous number of new functions. Of course many of them can, and
should, be grouped together. Still, while the tax specialist will often
be put together with other “financial” people, either in accounting or
in the treasurer’s department, his work is different and separate. This
also applies to product managers or market managers, who are equally
related to, and part of, the traditional marketing function, the
traditional research and development function, and the traditional
manufacturing function.</p>
<p>This requires better functional management. What specialties are
needed has to be de- cided or else the organization will drown in
useless and unused learning. There is need to think through what the key
activities are in which a high degree of specialized knowledge is needed
and to make sure that knowledge work in the key areas is provided for in
depth and with excellence. It also demands that knowledge work in other
areas either not be done at all or be kept in low key.</p>
<p>There is need to manage a specialty to make sure that it makes the
contribution to the enterprise for the sake of which it has been
established. There is need to anticipate today the new specialties that
will be needed tomorrow and the new demands that will be made tomorrow
on existing specialties. There is need, in other words, for functional
concern with what (in Chapter 33) I called management development.</p>
<p>There is great need for concern with, and for management of, the
specialists them- selves. Do they work on the truly important things, or
do they fritter away their time? Do they do over again what they already
know how to do, or do they work on creatirig new potential and new
performance capacity? Are they being used productively, or are they just
being kept busy? There is need also for concern with their development
as profes- sionals and as persons.</p>
<p>These are crucial questions which cannot be answered by checking how
many hours a man works. They require knowledge of the functional area
and genuine functional man- agement.</p>
<p>A good deal of knowledge work will undoubtedly be organized on a
strictly functional basis. A good deal will also be done by individuals
who, in effect, are an “organizational component” by themselves.</p>
<p>The tax expert is an example. He has a “home,” that is, he is usually
housed in some financial or accounting staff. But he really has no boss
except the company, and no cus- tomer except the company. And he has
little concern with what the other people in the accounting department
are doing. In fact, he is actually an outside consultant on the per-
manent payroll.</p>
<p>But these isolated individuals—tax expert and company lawyer, medical
director and government-relations counsel—rarely create organizational
or structural problems.</p>
<p>An increasing number of knowledge workers, however, will have a
“functional” home but do their work in a team with other knowledge
workers from other functions and disci- plines. The more advanced the
knowledge worker’s knowledge the more likely it is that he will do his
work and make his contribution in cross-functional teams rather than in
his own functional component. For the more advanced knowledge is the
more specialized it has to be. And specialized knowledge is a fragment,
if not mere “data.” It becomes pro- ductive only if put together with
other people’s knowledge. It becomes effective only as input to other
people’s decisions, other people’s work, other people’s understanding.
It becomes “results” only in a team.</p>
<p>Knowledge organization will therefore increasingly have two axes: a
functional one, managing the man and his knowledge; another one the
team, managing work and task. Seen one way, this undermines the
functional principle and destroys it. Seen another way, it saves the
functional principle and makes it fully effective. It certainly requires
strong, professional, effective, functional managers and functional
components.</p>
<p>The team is clearly not the panacea advertised by a good deal of the
discussion of the “small group” and “free-form organization.” It is a
difficult structure requiring very great self-discipline. It has severe
limitations and major weaknesses.</p>
<p>But it is also not, as many managers still believe, a temporary
expedient for dealing with nonrecurring “special problems.” It is a
genuine design principle of organization. It is the best principle for
such permanent organizing tasks as top-management work and innovating
work. And it is an important and perhaps essential complement to
functional structure—in mass-production work, whether manual or
clerical, and above all, in knowl- edge work. It is the key, in all
probability, to making functional skill fully effective in the knowledge
organization.</p>

<p>N “FEDERAL DECENTRALIZATION”* a company is organized in a number of
autonomous businesses. Each unit has responsibility for its own
performance, its own results, and is own contribution to the total
company. Each unit has its own manage- ment which, in effect, runs its
own “autonomous business.”</p>
<p>Federal decentralization (as has been mentioned earlier, in Chapter
41) was first worked out, though only crudely, by Pierre S. du Pont in
1920 in the reorganization of the family-owned Du Pont Company, which
had outgrown, during World War I, an older functional structure. When
Pierre S. du Pont, shortly thereafter, took over the presidency of
General Motors, which was then in desperate trouble, he found that
Alfred P. Sloan, then GM’s executive vice-president, had arrived at a
similar, though far more polished version. Sloan’s “decentralized
operations with centralized policy control”—put into ef- fect during
1921-22—became the prototype of decentralization. Among the many imita-
tions and adaptations, the one made in 1950-52 for the reorganization of
the General Electric Company became, in the years of the “management
boom,” the standard model worldwide.†</p>
<p>*The commonly used term is “decentralization” (“divisionalization” in
Japan). But this is confusing as there are other forms of
“decentralization.” It is also misleading. The best name for this design
principle would be the “federal principle.”</p>
<p>†For Sloan’s prototype see my book, Concept of the Corporation.</p>
<p>“If only efforts are organized properly, the right results will
follow” is the underlying premise. Decentralization, by contrast, starts
out with the question “What results do we aim for?” It tries to set up
the right business first, that is, the unit that will have optimal
capacity for results and especially for results in the marketplace. Then
the question is asked “What work, what efforts, what key activities have
to be set up and organized</p>
<p>within the autonomous business?”</p>
<p>It is desirable, of course, to set up the same or, at least, a
similar functional structure for all or most of the autonomous
businesses within a company. All Sears stores, regard- less of size or
location, have, for instance, a store controller, an operations manager,
and department heads for major merchandise areas such as appliances. All
GM manufacturing divisions have the same seven key functions:
engineering, manufacturing, master- mechanic, purchasing, marketing
accounting, and personnel, with the head of each report- ing directly to
the division’s general manager.</p>
<p>But care should be taken lest this desirable unity become stifling
uniformity.</p>
<p>The GE reorganization of 1950-52 provides an example of what not to
do. GE de- cided that the “typical manufacturing business” has five key
functions: engineering, manufacturing, marketing, accounting, and
personnel. That this did not fit non- manufacturing businesses such as
the General Electric Credit Corporation, everyone saw, of course. But
two things were not seen—with resulting high damage. First, it was not
realized that some manufacturing businesses needed additional and
different key func- tions, or at least a different arrangement of the
same functional work. One example was the computer business, where
product development and customer service were far too important to be
subordinated to engineering and marketing. GE’s failure in the computer
business had many causes, but the imposition of the functional structure
of a typical manufacturing business was probably a major contributor.
Second, there were some busi- nesses that looked like manufacturing
businesses but were, in effect, innovative busi- nesses. These units
were genuine businesses and result centers, but they had no “product”;
they were set up to develop one. They had no “market,” but a research
and development contract, mostly from the U.S. government. They did not
“manufacture”; at most they had a model shop to build a few prototypes.
Yet the functions of a typical manufacturing business were imposed on
them. Some of these innovative development businesses man- aged to
survive by quiet sabotage of the official structure. The others were
seriously dam- aged—some irreparably—by having to carry a heavy load of
functions they did not need and, above all, by misdirection of vision
and efforts.</p>
<p>This is misuse of the true strength of federal decentralization: the
focus on results. In using federal decentralization, the first question
should always be “What is the business of this ‘autonomous’ business?
What will it be? What should it be?” Then the key activities emerge and
can be organized effectively on functional or team lines.</p>
<p>The Strengths of Federal Decentralization</p>
<p>Of all design principles available so far, federal decentralization
comes closest to satisfy- ing all design specifications. It also has the
widest scope. Both operating work and inno- vative work can be organized
as decentralized autonomous businesses. And while top management can
obviously not be set up as an autonomous business, federal decentraliza-
tion of the business, if done properly, makes for strong and effective
top managements. It frees top management for the top-management
tasks.</p>
<p>Federal decentralization has great clarity and considerable economy.
It makes it easy for each member of the autonomous business to
understand his own task and to under- stand the task of the whole
business. It has high stability and is yet adaptable.</p>
<p>It focuses the vision and efforts of managers directly on business
performance and re- sults. The danger of self-deception, of
concentrating on the familiar but old and tired rather than on the
difficult but new and growing, or of allowing unprofitable lines to be
carried on the backs of the profitable ones, is much lessened. Reality
is not easily ob- scured by overhead or hidden in the figures for total
sales.</p>
<p>With respect to communications and decisions, the federal
organization is the only satisfactory design principle we possess. Since
the entire management group, or at least the upper ranks within it,
share a common vision and a common perception, they tend to communicate
easily. And usually, for that reason, communication between people in
dif- ferent kinds of work is encouraged all the way down the line rather
than frowned upon. Decision-making is also likely to be placed at the
optimal level without great effort. The focus tends to be on the right
rather than the wrong issue, and on the important rather than the
trivial decision.</p>
<p>used in preference to any other.</p>
<p>In a federally organized structure, each manager is close enough to
business perform- ance and business results to focus on them. He is
close enough to results to get immediate feedback from business
performance on his own task and work, even though he himself may be
purely functional in his job. The federal principle therefore enables us
to divide large and complex organizations into a number of businesses
that are small and simple enough so that managers know what they are
doing and can direct themselves toward the performance of the whole
instead of becoming prisoners of their own work, effort, and skill.</p>
<p>A Sears, Roebuck vice-president may have three hundred stores under
him—each an autonomous unit, responsible for marketing and for profits.
Each store manager may have thirty section managers under him, each
running his own autonomous unit and also re- sponsible for marketing and
profitability goals. As a result, there are only two levels in Sears
between the lowest management job, section manager in a store, and the
president: the store manager and the regional vice-president.</p>
<p>Above all, the general manager of the decentralized business, if only
in charge of a small business, is truly top management. He faces most of
the challenge’s of the top- management job in an independent company—the
one exception being, as a rule, the re- sponsibility for financial
resources and their supply. He has to make decisions. He has to build a
team. He has to think about markets and processes, people and money,
today and tomorrow. As a result, he is being tested in an autonomous,
albeit not an independent, command. Yet he is being tested fairly early
in his career, and at a reasonably low level. A mistake can, therefore,
be unmade without too much damage to the company, and, equally
important, without too much damage to the man. No other known principle
of organization, whether in business or in any other institution,
satisfies the need to prepare and test men for tomorrow’s leadership
positions nearly as well as the federal principle does.</p>
<p>The search for a system which will prepare and test tomorrow’s
leaders is the oldest problem of political theory and political
practice. No political system has ever solved it adequately. The
principle of federal decentralization, of course, does not solve it
fully. The autonomous manager of a decentralized business is still not
faced with the full re- sponsibility, let alone with the full
loneliness, of the top position. But the federal principle comes closer
to a solution than any other known design.</p>
<p>The principle of federal decentralization was developed for business
purposes. But it is just as applicable to non-businesses, that is, to
service institutions.</p>
<p>The hospital of tomorrow may be reorganized in autonomous federal
units. One such unit might, for instance, take care of the fairly small
number of hospital patients—about a quarter to one-third at any one time
in a general hospital—who need intensive care or clinical care. Another
unit might take care of the large load of ambulatory or short-stay
patients who require neither intensive clinical care nor surgery. Yet
another unit might take care of the large number of surgical patients
who require no hospitalization or only a</p>
<p>short stay of a day or two in a “hotel” bed rather than the far more
expensive “hospital” bed. Another autonomous component might be a mental
health unit, again mostly for am- bulatory patients. Another unit might
be the convalescent unit. There might further be a “hotel” unit—which in
effect is all the healthy mother and her healthy baby need two days
after the delivery of the child. All these units would, of course, share
common services— laboratories, dietitians and the kitchen, social and
maintenance workers, psychiatric case workers, physical therapists, and
so on. But these services are organized as central ser- vices anyhow
today.</p>
<p>The federal principle is equally adaptable to the organizing of
subunits within autonomous federal businesses.</p>
<p>Each of the autonomous departments which Pierre du Pont set up in
1920 has grown so much that it split itself internally into a number of
autonomous businesses—in Du Pont they are called divisions—each with its
own general manager, who has profit and loss responsibility and runs an
entire business with all its functions (except accounting, which is a
departmental function if not a corporate one). In some of these
sub-businesses there are even smaller autonomous units, each with its
own product lines, its own market, and its own business
responsibility.</p>
<p>The Requirements of Federal Decentralization</p>
<p>Federal decentralization has stringent requirements. It also makes
very substantial de- mands for responsibility and self-discipline.</p>
<p>Decentralization must not create a weak center. On the contrary, one
of the main pur- poses of federal organization is to strengthen top
management and to make it capable of doing its own work rather than be
forced to supervise, coordinate, and prop up operating work. Federal
decentralization will work only if the top-management job is clearly de-
fined and thought through.</p>
<p>The crucial question in any federal system is “What are the tasks of
top management, and how can top management get the time, the thought,
the perspective to discharge</p>
<p>them?” Federalization, if properly applied, makes top management
capable of doing its own job precisely because it does not have to worry
about operations, but can concentrate on direction, strategy,
objectives, and key decisions for the future.</p>
<p>“Decentralization” is therefore a misleading term—though it is by now
far too popular to be discarded.</p>
<p>The test of effective federal decentralization is top-management
strength. Top man- agement in a decentralized company must first accept
its responsibility for thinking through “what our business is and what
it should be.” It must accept the responsibility for setting the
objectives for the entire company and for working out the strategies for
obtain- ing these objectives. It must, in other words, accept the
responsibility for its own job. If a federal structure is the
best-functioning of all structures if properly managed, it is a sham-
bles if top management abdicates and does not live up to the
responsibilities of its own tasks.</p>
<p>Top management must think through carefully what decision it reserves
for itself. For there are decisions which have to do with the entire
company, its integrity, and its future. It does not necessarily follow
that every such decision has to be made on “overall consid- erations.”
On the contrary, most of them should be made on the basis of what is
good for an individual autonomous business. But these decisions can be
made only by somebody who sees the whole and is responsible for the
whole.</p>
<p>At General Electric, for instance, only corporate top management can
make the deci- sion to abandon a business or go into a new one. At
General Motors, top management at the central office sets the price
ranges within which each automobile division’s products have to fall,
and thus controls the competition between the major units of the
company. At Sears, Chicago headquarters decides what kinds of goods—hard
goods, appliances, fash- ion goods, and so forth—each store must
carry.</p>
<p>Top management in a decentralized structure has to be separate. It
cannot also run any of the autonomous businesses no matter how big or
important they are. Even in a small company that is organized in the
federal design at least one man (and preferably more— on this see
Chapters 50 and 51) needs to be charged exclusively with responsibility
for the top-management task for the entire business.</p>
<p>The traditional English system in which the “executive directors” of
the board, i.e., the full-time members of top management, tend to be the
heads of the major divisions and subsidiaries, therefore results in
there being neither top management nor decentralization. Basic decisions
are either not made at all or they are made by “swapping” between divi-
sion heads concerned—properly—with their own divisions rather than with
the company.* This may well be one of the main reasons for the
often-reported tendency of English companies to allocate capital and
other resources according to past history and size of a division rather
than according to opportunity, thus starving tomorrow.</p>
<p>Federal decentralization requires centralized controls and common
measurements. In- deed, wherever a federal organization gets in trouble
(wherever, for instance, layers of central management staffs are being
heaped on top of a federal structure), the reason is always that the
measurements at the disposal of the center are not good enough, so that
personal supervision has to be substituted. Both the managers of the
autonomous busi- nesses and top management must know what is expected of
each business, what is meant by “performance,” and what developments are
important. To be able to give autonomy one must have confidence. And
this requires controls that make opinions unnecessary. To be able to
manage by objectives one must know whether goals are being reached or
not; and this requires clear and reliable measurements.</p>
<p>The need for what Sloan called “centralized controls” is illustrated
by the experience of one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing
multinationals, Philips of Holland. Be- tween 1959 and 1972, Philips’s
worldwide sales increased almost fivefold: from .3 billion to billion.
But profits all but disappeared. The company had a strong top-
management team. It had technical and product leadership in a number of
major areas, from household appliances to electronics to light bulbs. It
represented an extreme in de- centralization, with hundreds of
subsidiary companies in sixty countries, each traditionally with its own
autonomous management. But it had virtually no control system such as
cen- tral planning, and no common measurements. The result was
fragmentation instead of</p>
<p>*On this see the case studies in David Granick, Managerial
Comparisons of Four Developed Countries: France, Britain, United States
and Russia (M.I.T. Press, 1972).</p>
<p>decentralization, excessive and uncontrolled inventories, unplanned
capital investment, and overstaffing. Philips, in terms of safes, is
only two-thirds the size of the General Elec- tric Company, but in
capital investment and number of employees it matches GE—while its
profits are barely a fifth of those of GE. It was only when Philips in
several years of hard work injected centralized controls, common
measurement, and coordinated planning that the company began to reap the
rewards of its technical and marketing achievements. And only then did
the “autonomous business managers” of the various Philips companies
really acquire autonomy; only then could they plan for their businesses,
set objectives, and organize their own work.</p>
<p>The converse of this is that the federal principle demands great
responsibility from the operating units, the autonomous businesses. They
are given the maximum of autonomy;</p>
<p>Size Requirements</p>
<p>Federal decentralization was designed as an answer to a problem of
size: the deterioration that sets in functional structures when they
reach more than medium size. But federal de- centralization also has
size requirements. When the federal unit becomes so large that the
components within it, that is, the functional subunits (e.g.,
manufacturing) exceed the size at which they function, the whole
autonomous business becomes unwieldy, sluggish, and too big to perform.
The “brain,” that is, the top management of the autonomous unit, may
still perform. But the “members,” that is, the functional components,
turn rigid and bu- reaucratic and will increasingly serve themselves
rather than the common purpose.</p>
<p>Du Pont has been counteracting this in part by splitting autonomous
businesses in two as they grow bigger, in part (as said earlier) by
setting up small autonomous decentralized businesses within large
autonomous decentralized businesses. Another approach is that of Johnson
andandandand Johnson, the very large, multinational producer of
health-care products rang- ing from absorbent cotton to birth-control
pills. J andandandand J for many years tried to limit the size of each
business to 250 employees, each run as a separate company with its own
complete management and its own board of directors, and each “reporting”
directly to a small, cen- tral parent-company top-management team. While
J andandandand J, with worldwide sales of over a billion dollars and
40,000 employees, has been forced to accept individual businesses a good
deal larger than 250 employees, it still limits the size of each
business and will split it rather than permit it to grow large. As a
result, functional units are still quite small in every J andandandand J
business.</p>
<p>But breaking up or subdividing autonomous businesses as they grow to
large size is not always possible; or at least it is not always done.
And the result is then the emergence of “functional empires.”</p>
<p>The Chevrolet division of General Motors, for instance, has grown so
large that it would by itself be the world’s third or fourth largest
manufacturing company if it were</p>
<p>independent. It is a decentralized autonomous product business. But
internally it is func- tionally organized and highly centralized. GM
tries to counteract the resulting insulation of the large—very
large—functional units by frequently moving functional managers from
Chevrolet into the other and smaller (though still large) automotive
divisions and moving functional managers from other divisions into
Chevrolet. But when GM in the early seventies took responsibility for
final assembly away from Chevrolet and moved it into a separate assembly
division organized on the “simulated decentralization” principle (see
below), one explanation given for this move was the need to restore
“result-focus” to a large assembly operation that was becoming
“effort-focused.” And a good many, espe- cially of the younger, GM
executives apparently believe that Chevrolet should long ago have been
split up into a number of separate divisions, one, for instance, in
charge of the large truck business; another one, perhaps, in charge of
the smaller cars such as “com- pacts” and “subcompacts,” with the
original Chevrolet division confined to “standard- sized” passenger
automobiles. (See below, Chapter 55.)</p>
<p>Ralph Cordiner, the architect of GE’s reorganization in the fifties,
used to say that an autonomous business in a decentralized structure
should be so small that “a good man can get his arms around it.” This is
hardly a precise quantitative term. But it would imply that an
autonomous business should be no more than “fair-sized” to get the full
benefits of federal decentralization. This means (as discussed in
Chapter 54) that a small group of men at the top—four or five maybe—can
still tell without having to consult charts, re- cords, or organization
manuals, who the key people are in the unit, where they are, what their
assignments are and how they perform, where they came from and where
they are likely to go. If autonomous businesses get much larger federal
decentralization may still be the best alternative. But it is then the
“lesser evil” rather than the optimum.</p>
<p>How Small Is Too Small?</p>
<p>But the decentralized autonomous unit also needs to be big enough to
support the man- agement it needs.</p>
<p>How small is too small depends on the business. A Sears store, or a
Marks andandandand Spencer store, can be quite small and yet support
adequate management. All a small store needs is one manager and a few
department heads who actually manage on the selling floor.</p>
<p>In the U.S., mass-production metalworking industry, a truly
autonomous product busi- ness, is rarely capable of supporting adequate
management and its own engineering, manufacturing, and marketing work
unless it sells twenty to thirty million dollars’ worth of merchandise a
year. Businesses with a significantly lower sales volume are in danger
of being understaffed, or staffed with inadequate people.</p>
<p>When such very small units are organized as autonomous businesses,
their internal structure should be team design rather than functional
structure. This is the way in which all but the largest of the
individual Sears stores actually work.</p>
<p>The decisive criterion is not size but the scope and challenge of the
management job.</p>
<p>A federal unit should always have enough scope so that a good man can
show his ability. It should have enough challenge so that the management
group in the unit truly has to manage: that is, to think through
objectives and plans, to build human resources into an effective team,
to integrate the work, and to measure its performance. It should have
enough challenge so that management will have to work on all major
phases of a business, but also enough challenge so that it can really
develop a market, a product or service— and, above all, can truly
develop people. The true criterion of size for an autonomous business
unit is not economics. It is managerial scope and challenge, and
managerial per- formance.</p>
<p>The autonomous businesses of a decentralized organization should not
have to depend on central service staffs, that is, on advisory and
teaching activities operating out of head- quarters.</p>
<p>A decentralized organization needs effective “conscience” work. It
needs, especially if large and diversified, organized thinking and
planning for top management, that is, the</p>
<p>“secretariat” or “business research” group discussed in Chapter 51.
It needs strong central information and unified controls and
measurements. It will have some “common operat- ing work,” e.g., the
supply and management of money, research, legal counsel, relations with
the public, organized labor, and government, and perhaps purchasing. It
may have to organize company-wide work on the kind of “social
RandandandandD” discussed in Chapter 25 and on innovation in key
activities whether marketing or managing people.</p>
<p>But it should neither need nor use central service staffs to “advise”
the operating man- agements of the decentralized units. These units
should be strong enough to stand on their own feet. If they are not,
service staffs will not cure their weakness but compound it. Such
service staffs are, of necessity, focused on their functional area
rather than on business performance and business results. Being located
at the central office, they inevitably have the inside track to top
management. In decentralized companies where service staffs are big and
busy pleasing the staff people thus becomes more important than running
the business for performance.</p>
<p>The pioneers of federal decentralization knew this and kept service
staffs small and lean. Many of the companies that adopted federal
decentralization in the fifties or sixties have, however, built massive
central service staffs.</p>
<p>They may have had little choice. Setting up these central services in
functional areas was, in many cases, the only politically feasible thing
to do. Otherwise, the strong tradi- tional functional structures would
have blocked the shift to federal decentralization, which of course,
threatened their power and prominence. Even the rhetoric used to justify
these large staff services—e.g., “the need for excellence” or “for
professionalism” in functional areas—was often a necessary political
price. But at least this should be recognized. Ser- vice staffs created
to placate powerful functional barons should be phased out as the peo-
ple in them retire. New people should not be brought in. New work should
be sanctioned only if old projects and activities are being sloughed
off. And, after a transition period of a few years, that part of the
budget of such staffs that goes for “service” to autonomous businesses
might be limited to what the “customers,” i.e., the people in the
autonomous businesses, voluntarily “buy” rather than be raised by a
compulsory levy.</p>
<p>Dependence on central staff service can only impose on a
decentralized organization the weaknesses and vulnerabilities, without
giving it the benefits and strengths, of func- tional design.</p>
<p>What Is a “Business”?</p>
<p>Federal decentralization is applicable only where a company can truly
be organized into a number of genuine “businesses.” This is its basic
limitation.</p>
<p>But what is a “business”? Ideally, of course, a federal unit should
be a complete busi- ness in its own right.</p>
<p>This idea underlay Alfred P. Sloan, Jr.’s, organization of General
Motors in the early 1920s. Each of the automotive divisions did its own
design, its own engineering, its own manufacturing, its own marketing,
and its own sales. The divisions were limited as to the price range in
which they could offer automobiles but totally autonomous otherwise.
GM’s accessory divisions sold a large share of their output to the
automotive divisions of their own company. But they were organized to
sell an even larger share directly to the outside market and indeed,
very often, to General Motors’s own competitors. They too were
“businesses” in every sense of the word. And so are the autonomous
companies into which Johnson andandandand Johnson has organized itself.
Each has its own product lines, its own research and development, its
own markets and marketing.</p>
<p>But how much of the reality of a genuine business does there have to
be for federal decentralization to work effectively? As a minimum the
unit must contribute a profit to the company rather than merely
contribute to the profit of the company. Its profit or loss should
directly become company profit or loss. In fact, the company’s total
profit should be the sum total of the profits of the individual
businesses. And it must be a genuine</p>
<p>profit—not arrived at by manipulating accounting figures, but
determined by the objective judgment of the marketplace.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more important—and the genuine touchstone of autonomy—is
that the federal unit must have a market of its own. The market may be
only a geographic entity— as in the Sears or the Marks andandandand
Spencer stores, or in the case of the “regional companies” into which
several large American life insurance companies have divided themselves.
But still there has to be a distinct market within which the unit is, so
to speak, the company.</p>
<p>In some industries there may be more than one distinct market for the
same product lines in the same geographic area, and therefore scope for
two distinct businesses with similar products.</p>
<p>Institutional buyers of chairs—hospitals, schools, restaurants,
hotels, large offices— are a different market from homeowners. They may
buy the same or very similar mer- chandise. But they use different
distributive channels, pay different prices, buy in differ- ent ways.
One fair-sized furniture company attributes its growth largely to having
set up retail furniture and institutional furniture as separate product
businesses.</p>
<p>As long as a business can have full market responsibility and
objective comparability of results, it can obtain its products from
another autonomous unit or from a centralized company-run manufacturing
source, and yet be an autonomous business.</p>
<p>Neither the Sears store nor the Marks andandandand Spencer store are
true “businesses.” They do not do their own buying, do not even decide
what merchandise to carry and what prices to charge. Yet in its
geographic area each store stands on its own. And because all Sears or
Marks andandandand Spencer stores get the same merchandise at the same
cost from the same central buying office, they can be compared
meaningfully to one another. Within the system, the Sears store manager
is autonomous and can be measured by performance and results.</p>
<p>Where, however, no genuine market test exists, we should not speak of
an autonomous business. Federal decentralization then does not work.</p>
<p>GE had had one big autonomous business, the apparatus sales division,
to sell and supply turbines, switch gear, and transformers to the
electric power companies. This divi- sion worked closely with the
individual power companies on the overall design of power stations and
transmission lines, and then assembled from the various GE plants, as
well as from outside, whatever equipment was needed to satisfy an
individual customer. Under the GE reorganization of 1952 the “product
departments,” i.e., switchgears or transform- ers” were given “business
responsibility,” and the apparatus sales division besame a “dis-
tributor.” This did not work. The product departments could not truly
assume business responsibility. And the apparatus sales division, while
the only real “business,” no longer had the needed authority. Confusion
instead of clarity was created; friction instead of re- sponsibility.
Eventually most of the old structure had to be restored, even though the
ap- paratus sales division is far bigger than what “one man can get his
arms around.”</p>
<p>So far we have been discussing federal decentralization of operating
work, that is, of existing and known businesses. A decentralized unit
for innovative work is structured and measured differently (see Chapter
6). But federal decentralization is also the most effec- tive design
principle for such work—on condition, however, that its performance and
results can be objectively measured. A decentralized innovative unit
also has to be a busi- ness—or must be capable of becoming one.</p>
<p>Simulated Decentralization</p>
<p>Whenever a unit can be set up as a business no design principle can
match federal decen- tralization. We have learned, however, that a great
many large companies cannot be di- vided into genuine businesses. Yet
they have clearly outgrown the limits of size and com- plexity of the
functional or of the team structure.</p>
<p>These are the companies that are increasingly turning to “simulated
decentralization”</p>
<p>as the answer to their organization problem.</p>
<p>Simulated decentralization forms structural units which are not
businesses but which are still set up as if they were businesses, with
maximum possible autonomy, with their</p>
<p>own management, and with at least a “simulation” of profit and loss
responsibility. They buy from and sell to each other using “transfer
prices” determined internally rather than by an outside market. Or their
“profits” are arrived at by internal allocation of costs to which then,
often, a “standard fee” such as 20 percent of costs, is added.</p>
<p>The prime examples are companies in the chemical and “materials”
industries.</p>
<p>An integrated chemical company runs on three axes or on three
different logics: the logic of research, the logic of process, and the
logic of the market. In research and devel- opment, the categories that
inform organization are given by knowledge definitions, such as
“polymers,” “bonding,” and “surface phenomena.” The process, in turn,
tends to be raw-material determined. No process can conceivably turn
sulfuric acid into petrochemi- cals or petrochemicals into sulfuric
acid. The market, finally, has a logic all its own. It buys neither
“inorganic” chemicals nor “organic” chemicals. It buys adhesives, glue,
coat- ings, reagents, cleansers. It buys, in other words, what a product
will do rather than chemical formula or process technology. And most
customers buy a bewildering variety of different chemicals for all kinds
of purposes. The logic of the market is “end-use” logic.</p>
<p>Yet the large chemical company, whether Du Pont and Monsanto in the
U.S., ICI in Britain, Pechiney in France, or Badische in Germany, must
be able to:</p>
<p>• develop new products across a wide range of chemical disciplines
and tech- nologies;</p>
<p>• produce a wide variety of products from a large number of raw
materials; and</p>
<p>• supply a wide variety of end users with the chemicals they need for
their own manufacturing process.</p>
<p>The same applies, in somewhat lesser degree, to glass, steel,
aluminum, and paper manufacturers. These “materials” businesses were the
success stories before World War I. They were still leaders in the
period between the two wars. Their growth in terms of sales and volume
since World War II has been even faster than in earlier periods. But
results have been increasingly disappointing. And the reason, as more
and more have come to realize, is that they have outgrown functional
organization. They have lost the ability for effective communications,
for flexibility, for making decisions fast, and for carrying out
decisions once made.</p>
<p>It has been often said of such major American materials companies as
Aluminum Company of America that they make the right decisions, but make
them nine months too late and then take another nine months before
putting them into action—and the same criticism has been leveled against
the chemical giants, whether in the U.S., in Britain, or in Germany. It
simply takes too long for a decision to travel the way it has to travel
in a large functional structure; all the way up to the top and then all
the way down again. And both the problems to be decided and the
decisions reached are likely to be garbled out of all recognition on
their way through countless levels.</p>
<p>Simulated decentralization is the one available design principle that
copes with the structural problems of the big materials business.</p>
<p>Many chemical manufacturers have, for instance, organized their
business in three sets of units, each based on simulated
decentralization. A research and development corpora- tion is set up and
organized by major fields of study and inquiry. Some companies, e.g.,
Monsanto, have set up separate marketing components and separate
manufacturing com- ponents, both with profit and loss
responsibility.</p>
<p>The Japanese steel companies market through separate “trading
companies,” both at home and abroad. In the Aluminum Company of America
and in Republic Steel produc- tion is organized in geographic
manufacturing units, each considered a profit and loss center.
Marketing, however, is organized in end-use units, that is, by major
industrial buyers of aluminum or steel, such as the automobile industry
and the construction indus- try. Corning Glass, one of the world’s
largest manufacturers of glass, is similarly organ-</p>
<p>ized by manufacturing units and by marketing units, each set up on
the basis of simulated decentralization.</p>
<p>Simulated decentralization is equally applicable in single-product
companies of simi- lar size and complexity. IBM may be the leading
example.</p>
<p>IBM, by and large, has one main product: computers. Only one of the
markets can be split off as autonomous, the government and defense
market. The great bulk of IBM’s business, some 80 percent or so,
supplies one product to one market, i.e., computers to business, both in
the United States and abroad. Yet the computer business, with its many
billions of dollars of sales and its great complexity is much too big to
be organized by functions. Accordingly, IBM has split its data
processing (for which read “computer”) business into two key units, each
considered an autonomous business, on the basis of simulated
decentralization. Marketing and services is one, and development and
manufac- turing is the other. Each unit is considered a profit and loss
center.</p>
<p>The most interesting attempts to apply simulated decentralization to
very large busi- nesses which cannot apply federal decentralization were
the reorganizations of major New York commercial banks in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Both the First National City Bank and the Chase Manhattan Bank,
respectively New York’s first and second banks in deposits, have
reorganized themselves into simulated decentralized structures. City
Bank split itself into five autonomous units, each headed by a
“president”: retail (i.e., the individual depositor and borrower),
commercial (i:e., small and medium-sized businesses), corporate (i.e.,
large businesses), international, and fiduci- ary services such as
investment management. Each unit has its own objectives, its own plans,
and its own profit and loss statements. The Chase organization, though
developed independently, is roughly similar.</p>
<p>These bank examples also show clearly some of the major problems of
simulated de- centralization. In both banks it is the large branch, such
as the Rockefeller Center branch of each bank, or the branch in London,
which is the geographic focus of the bank’s busi- ness. Sometimes the
branch acts merely as the landlord and facilities manager for the rep-
resentatives of each of the five “autonomous banks” that occupy space in
the branch. Sometimes the branch is the “banker.” At different times it
is both. Clearly, the large branch is also a “business” and a profit and
loss center. And who coordinates the different “banks” and focuses them
on the individual customer who often is—or should be—a “re- tail,” a
“commercial,” a “fiduciary,” and even a “corporate” customer all at
once? The head of a small business, for instance, will use the bank
which finances his firm for his personal banking business and for his
savings account, will expect it to act as executor of his will, to be
the manager for his investments and the trustee for his firm’s pension
fund. He does not want to deal with four different banks. Whose customer
is he, and who gets the credit for his business?</p>
<p>Simulated decentralization is obviously difficult and full of
problems. Yet it will be used even more in the future. For the growth
areas of economy and society—process in- dustries and private and
governmental service institutions—are the sectors in which simu- lated
decentralization has its greatest potential of application. In these
sectors neither functional organization nor federal decentralization can
do the organizing job. Managers therefore need to know the requirements
and limitations of simulated decentralization. What problems can be
expected in an organization built on it?</p>
<p>The Problems of Simulated Decentralization</p>
<p>Simulated decentralization is a poor “fit” with respect to all design
specifications. It is not clear. It does not make for an easy focus on
performance. It rarely satisfies the specifica- tion that everyone
should be able to know his own task. Neither does it satisfy the demand
that managers and professionals should be able to understand the job of
the whole.</p>
<p>Least satisfactory in simulated decentralization are economy,
communications, and decision authority. These weaknesses are inherent in
the design. Because the unit of simu- lated decentralization is not
truly a business, its results are not truly determined by market</p>
<p>performance. They are, in large measure, the results of internal
management decisions. They are decisions on “transfer prices” and “cost
allocations.”</p>
<p>What should a market component of a chemical company pay for the
products it “buys” from a manufacturing component inside the company
which is also considered a business and expected to make a profit on its
own investment? There is no “market price.” There is, therefore, no
objective basis, such as the prices the accessory divisions of Gen- eral
Motors obtain for their product outside of GM. The only possible basis
is cost. And the only way to show a profit is to impose an arbitrary
charge on top of the manufacturing unit’s cost. The marketing unit,
however, could not obtain the products it sells on the out- side—either
because they are not obtainable at all except from competitors, because
the volume needed is too great to depend on outside suppliers, or
because quality is crucial (as in the “intermediates” for pharmaceutical
products). At the very best, the profit and loss of both, the
manufacturing and the marketing, are approximations of genuine
results.</p>
<p>Communications therefore are likely to carry more ’noise” than
message. A tremen- dous amount of managerial time and energy is spent on
working out the demarcation lines between different units which
supposedly are autonomous; on making sure that they co- operate; on
adjudicating disputes between them; or on settling priorities between
two marketing divisions within the same company, both of which want the
same scarce prod- uct from the same autonomous manufacturing unit, and
on the shortest possible time. The smallest adjustment becomes a
top-management decision, a trial of strength, and a matter of honor and
sacred principle.</p>
<p>Simulated decentralization makes high human demands: on
self-discipline, on mutual toleration, on subordinating one’s own
interest, including the interest in one’s own com- pensation, to
arbitration by higher authority; demands to be a “good sport” and a
“cheer- ful loser”; demands that are far more difficult and, above all,
far more divisive than the high demands which federal decentralization
makes on people.</p>
<p>I once heard a candidate for a very senior position in a big bank
turned down because his unit was doing too well at the bank’s expense.
“He puts the performance of his own unit before everything else.” The
next man was turned down because “he is too willing to subordinate the
performance of his unit to the needs and requirements of other units
and, therefore, does not show a good enough performance.” Everyone
admitted to confusion when I asked, “Are there any guidelines for
behavior? Is there any way in which you can tell a man ahead of time
what you consider ‘excessive concern’ for performance and what you
consider ‘excessive cooperation’?” Everyone also admitted that this was
the greatest worry of his own subordinates. “You have to play it by
ear,” the ranking officer finally concluded. But then he stopped himself
and added, “But by whose ear?”</p>
<p>In its scope, simulated decentralization is limited to operating
work. It clearly has no applicability to top-management work. And if
innovative work cannot be set up as a fed- eral decentralized unit, it
requires either functional or team structure.</p>
<p>Rules for Using Simulated Decentralization</p>
<p>The main rule is to look upon simulated decentralization as a last
resort only. As long as a functional structure—with or without the
complement of teams—works, that is, as long as a business is small or
fair-sized, simulated decentralization is to be shunned. And be- yond
such size, federal decentralization is vastly preferable.</p>
<p>Even in the materials company; federal decentralization might be
tried first. One ex- ample of an adaptation of genuine federal
decentralization to a materials business is Owens-Illinois in Toledo,
Ohio, a very large manufacturer of glass bottles. After World War II,
when plastic bottles came in wide use, Owens-Illinois had to go into
plastics to retain its leadership position in the bottle market. The
company decided, after long soul- searching, to set up both the
glass-bottle business and the plastic-bottle business as sepa- rate
autonomous “product” businesses, competing with each other for the same
customers and in the same markets.</p>
<p>The Owens-Illinois strategy was a brilliant success; the company’s
growth has been very rapid. And yet, fifteen years later, in the early
seventies, Owens-Illinois changed over to simulated decentralization. It
retained the two divisions but confined them to manufacturing. Marketing
of all bottles, glass and plastic, was put into a new marketing
division. The reason given was that the customers demanded one source of
supply for all their bottles. “Glass” and “plastics” were not meaningful
terms for them; they buy bottles and not materials.</p>
<p>With all its limitations, weaknesses, and risks, simulated
decentralization may there- fore be the best available principle where
constituent parts of the same large business have to work together and
yet have to have individual responsibility. This applies espe- cially
where the logic of market is incompatible with that of technology and
production.</p>
<p>Indeed, we may have to learn how to extend its scope. It is the most
promising ap- proach to the organization of large and complex
“monolithic” businesses (and non- business service institutions). The
leading examples here are the large transportation companies, especially
railroads and airlines, but also the typical government agency.</p>
<p>A railroad or an airline has by definition no purely “local”
business. Hence, businesses like this have so far no choice but to
organize themselves according to functions with, at best, a regional
coordinator who intervenes between the functions, mediates, and insures
liaison. The decisions which affect performance of a transportation
system can only be taken centrally. They are, above all, decisions on
capital utilization, on the assignment of airplanes, locomotives, and
freight cars, for instance. Yet transportation businesses, while
incapable of being decentralized except for relatively unimportant
tasks, are also clearly far too large to work well under functional
organization.</p>
<p>In simulated decentralization we at least know what to expect. It is
therefore a major task of organization theory and organization practice
to develop for these large and over- centralized functional structures,
such as a railroad system or most government agencies, an organization
design that works no worse for them than simulated decentralization
works, for instance, for the large materials companies and the large
commercial banks. This will probably have to be some application of the
principle of simulated decentraliza- tion.</p>

<p>The Systems Structure</p>
<p>NASA—The Japanese Systems Designs and the “Multinational”—Diversity
of Cul- tures and Values—The Difficulties of the Systems Structure—Its
Requirements—Its Importance</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>F THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES OF ORGANIZATION, only one, Fayol’s functions,
can be said to have started in a theoretical analysis. The others—the
team, federal decentralization, and simulated decentralization—grew out
of ad hoc responses to specific challenges and needs of the moment. This
applies also to the systems structure. It was developed as a design
principle for one apparently unique management problem: that of the
American space effort in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Systems organization is an extension of the team design principle.
But instead of indi- viduals comprising a team, the systems organization
builds the team out of a wide variety of different organizations. They
may be government agencies and any number of private businesses, large
and small; universities and individual researchers; organizations that
are part of the central organization charged with the task and directly
controlled by it, others who may be wholly or partly owned by it but run
autonomously, and yet others which stand only in a contractual
relationship to the parent organization and are in no way con- trolled
by it or even controllable. Systems design uses all the other design
principles as the task demands: functional organizations and teams,
federal and simulated decentraliza- tion.</p>
<p>Some of the members of the systems structure may have a specific task
which does not change throughout the entire life of the venture. Others
may have various tasks according to the stage of the program. Some will
be permanent members. Others may be brought in only for one specific
assignment, after which they sever their relationship with the sys- tems
structure.</p>
<p>The “model” which first made the systems structure visible as a
principle of organiza- tion design was the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) in its or- ganization of the U.S. space
program in the 1960s.* But while our awareness of the exis- tence of
such a structure is fairly recent, it has been in existence a long time.
While the large systems structure emerged as a design principle in a
huge governmental program, it actually was first developed as a
structure for businesses; and major future application is probably in
business.</p>
<p>Though Sayles and Chandler may not have realized it, their book on
NASA describes a system used in Japan for a century. The Japanese large
company and its suppliers and</p>
<p>*And the only description of systems management we have so far are
studies of NASA: James E. Webb (NASA Administrator from 1961 to 1968),
Space Age Management (McGraw-Hill, 1968) and, especially, Leonard R.
Sayles and Margaret K. Chandler, Managing Large Systems (Harper
andandandand Row, 1971).</p>
<p>distributors work in a very similar relationship to that in which
NASA worked with its suppliers, subcontractors, and partners. The
Japanese large company sometimes owns its suppliers. More often it has
little or no ownership stake in them. Yet the suppliers are integrated
into the “system.” Similarly, the Japanese large company usually depends
upon a trading company which is both independent and integrated. The
relationships among the large companies which constitute one industrial
group (Zaibatsu) are also comparable to the relationships which NASA
developed for its own needs.</p>
<p>It is becoming clear that something very much like the systems
structure will have to be developed for the multinational corporation.
Indeed, many of the approaches worked out for the multinational
corporation are truly (though not consciously) systems manage- ment
concepts. And the typical problems of the multinational corporation are
also the typical problems of a systems structure.</p>
<p>One example is the structure the Chase Manhattan Bank has developed
for its world- wide banking system. In contrast to the traditional
approach, Chase decided not to rely exclusively or even primarily on
wholly-owned branches abroad. Instead, it has been ex- panding worldwide
through acquiring minority interests in well-established, medium- sized,
local hanks. These banks are not owned or controlled by the Chase. Nor
is the top management usually furnished by the Chase. But they are part
of the “Chase system.” They are integrated into the worldwide banking
facilities and services of the bank while, at the same time, they keep
strong local roots in their own community. They are both in- dependent
and integrated.</p>
<p>Another example is the multinational advertising agency. The
headquarters of the firm may be in New York, and the branches in England
or Germany may be wholly owned subsidiaries. The structure may look, at
first glance, like federal decentralization. But the needs of
multinational clients demand that these federal autonomous businesses
work together in a systems relationship. To service a client whose
headquarters is outside of the United States—Unilever in London and
Rotterdam, for instance, Nestle in Switzerland, or Sony in Tokyo—the
overall responsibility for the account has to be lodged where the cli-
ent is, that is, in England, Switzerland, or Japan. Yet there have to be
relationships with every one of the subsidiaries of the clients wherever
they might be. There is need, there- fore, for a network of local
account executives who work out of a local autonomous de- centralized
business and yet work closely together. All the worldwide facilities of
the ad- vertising agencies, whether market research, media research, or
media buying, have to be available to these account executives, wherever
the experts are. While an advertising campaign may be worldwide, it has
to be adapted in every single country to the products the multinational
client produces and markets in the country, to the specific needs and
demands of the local market, to local habits, tastes, and consumer
preferences, and to the media available in each marker and effective in
it. And a worldwide accounting prac- tice—legally one huge multinational
partnership—is also a true systems structure.</p>
<p>What all these organizations have in common is the need to integrate
diversity of cul- tures and values into unity of action. Each of the
components of the system has to work in its own way, be effective
according to its own logic and according to its own accepted norm of
behavior. Or else it will not be effective at all. Yet all components
have to work toward a common goal. Each has to accept, understand, and
carry out its own role. This can be achieved only by direct, flexible,
and tailor-made relationships among people or groups of people in which
personal bond and mutual trust bridge wide differences in ways of
behavior, point of view, and in what is considered “proper” and
“appropriate.”</p>
<p>NASA, for instance, faced the problem of the divergent values and
cultures of a large government agency some major units of which were
organized by, and heavily staffed with, men used to the ways of U.S.
military services while others were built and run by German-born and
German-trained space scientists like Wernher von Braun in the tradition
of the German Herr Professor with his helpers and assistants.
Businesses, some very large (e.g., Pan American Airways), some quite
small, were “partners” on the “team” rather than “subcontractors.” They
did not make and deliver a part to preset specifications but planned,
designed, and operated the “nervous systems” of the entire space effort,
e.g., the</p>
<p>huge launch complex at Cape Kennedy. Other “team members” were
individual university scientists working by themselves in their own
laboratories.</p>
<p>That the multinational faces similar problems of cultural and value
diversity needs lit- tle explanation. (See also Chapter 59.) But to talk
of the large Japanese company as “mul- ticultural” may at first glance
seem surprising. But Japan has had—and in large measure still has—what
the Japanese call the “double economy”: the “pre-modern” economy of
(mostly small) workshops and of wholesalers and retailers, and a
“modern” economy of (mostly large) manufacturing, banking, and marketing
businesses. They represent very different structures, are organized and
run quite differently, and define objectives and performance quite
differently. The systems design has enabled Japan to maintain those two
economies in parallel and in partnership for a century and to avoid—or
at least to cushion—the disruption of traditional society by
“modernization” which has occurred in every other non-Western country.
And there has been a second “cultural” problem for the large, modern
Japanese business: its relationship with and integration into the
interna- tional economy and business world, as a source of supply of
materials, machinery, and technology; as a market; and as an investor
and partner. Both the trading company and the “joint venture” are
cultural bridges, and systems design.</p>
<p>The Difficulties and Problems of the Systems Structures</p>
<p>Systems design is a very, poor “fit” with respect to all design
specifications. It lacks clar- ity. It lacks stability. People neither
find it easy to know what their job is, nor to under- stand the job of
the whole and their relationship to it. Communications are a continuing
problem, and one not capable of lasting solution. It is never clear
where a certain decision should he made, nor indeed what the basic
decisions are. Flexibility is great and receptiv- ity to new ideas is
almost too great. Yet the structure does not, as a rule, develop people
and test them for top-management positions. Above all, the systems
structure violates the principle of internal economy.</p>
<p>When NASA first started. the scientists who dominated it then
believed that controls, and especially, of course, computer-based
information, would run the system. They were soon disabused. One
constant theme of the Sayles-Chandler book is the crucial impor- tance
of face-to-face personal relationships, of constant meetings, and of
bringing people into the decision-making process, even on matters that
are remote from their own assign- ments. The key executives at NASA
spent something like two-thirds of their time in meet- ings, and mostly
in meetings on matters that, at first sight, were not directly related
to their own tasks.</p>
<p>Personal relationships are the only thing that prevents breakdown in
the systems struc- ture. There is constant need for arbitration of
conflicts between various members of the system for adjudication of
disputes or jurisdiction, on direction, on budgets, on people, on
priorities, and so on. The most important people, regardless of their
job descriptions or assigned tasks, spend most of their time keeping the
machinery running. In no other or- ganizational structure is the ratio
between output and effort needed for internal cohesion as unfavorable as
in the systems structure.</p>
<p>At the same time, the requirements for the systems structure to work
at all are exceed- ingly stringent. It demands absolute clarity of
objectives. The objectives themselves may well change, and change
rapidly. But at any one time they must be clear. And the objec- tive for
the work of each of the members of the system must be derived from the
objective of the whole and directly related to it. In other words, the
systems structure can function only if the job of thinking through “what
is our business and what should it be” is taken seriously and performed
with excellence. And then it requires that operational objectives and
strategy be developed with great care from the basic mission and
purpose.</p>
<p>“Get a man on the moon by 1970” is the kind of clear objective which
enables a sys- tems structure to work. But so was “Build an economically
strong Japan.” The multina- tional still has to develop objectives that
enable each of its constituent units to direct its</p>
<p>behavior toward some such a common goal—which is one of the main
problems of the multinational corporation.</p>
<p>Another requirement is a demand for universal communications
responsibility. Every member of the systems structure, but especially
every member of every one of the manag- ing groups, has to make sure
that mission, objective, and strategies are fully understood by
everyone, and that the doubts, questions, and ideas of every member are
heard, lis- tened to, respected, thought through, understood, and
resolved. This is how Sayles and Chandler phrased it:</p>
<p>One conclusion is clear: the communications requirements in these
projects [i.e., NASA] are overwhelming compared to those of more
traditional manufacturing processes. The impact of a newly identified
problem or discovery, or the search for the source of an unexplained
difficulty demands that a number of people in a variety of organizations
be involved almost simultaneously.*</p>
<p>The one multinational manufacturing business that has tackled the
problem reports ex- actly the same extreme emphasis on constant
communications.</p>
<p>The reorganization of Philips of Holland (discussed in the preceding
chapter) was based on federal decentralization. But because of the
diversity of Philips in geography, in technologies, and in products, top
management is largely a “system” of interlocking teams—a ten-man board
of management, thirteen worldwide product groups, and top- management
groups in up to sixty countries. And “management” at Philips means
nonstop communication, consultation, negotiation. Most of the key people
throughout Philips are Dutchmen who have come up in the company; yet the
diversity of their specific concerns, assignments, and environments
creates so much cultural diversity that only constant rela- tionships
can establish common vision, common effort, and effective decision.</p>
<p>A third requirement is that each member of the team, i.e.. each
managerial unit, take responsibility far beyond its own assignment. Each
member must, in effect, take top- management responsibility. To get any
results requires, from each member, a “high order of responsible
autonomy and the opportunity to innovate and even to change plans.”† At
the same time, each member must take efforts to know what goes on
throughout the entire system.</p>
<p>More than anything else the executives within a large-scale endeavor
must be able, one by one, and altogether, to see and to understand the
totality of the job that the end result was designed to do. Each must
see and understand the relationship of his evolving and changing
individual assignment, and of the functions and people involved in that
assignment, to the whole job and its requirement. This requires more
than knowing his place and his responsibility within the organization
itself, or knowing the organization “upside down.” It requires an
awareness between the total job as he sees it at the time, and his own
particular job within the total framework, including the elements of the
environment that are so much a part of the total.‡</p>
<p>No wonder that the systems structure has not, on the whole, been an
unqualified suc- cess. For every NASA with a successful moon shot (but
also with an almost unlimited budget to support it) dozens of systems
structures have failed miserably to perform or have done so only through
budgetary irresponsibility, such as no private business could survive
(e.g., the Concorde and various “weapons systems,” in Europe as well as
in the U.S.). The attempt to use systems management to tackle major
social problems—the much-touted promise of the sixties—is almost certain
to be a total failure. Social and po-</p>

space (where, after all, there are no voters) into the inner city and
its problems, into economic develop- ment, or even into something
seemingly so purely technical as mass transit, are almost certain to
overwhelm the precarious cohesion of a systems structure.</p>
<p>And yet the Japanese have been running complex and large systems
structures for a century. They have not avoided the difficulties nor
found a way around them. Indeed all the obvious inefficiencies of the
Japanese system—the fact, for instance, that top- management people
spend endless time in meetings and in building personal relationships
and communications—are, we now understand, built-in characteristics of
the systems structure. But the Japanese experience also shows that the
system can be made to work and can indeed be highly productive.</p>
<p>It needs, however, clear goals, high self-discipline throughout the
structure, and a top management that takes personal responsibility for
relationships and communications.</p>
<p>For the majority of managers, the systems structure is not of direct
personal concern— though any manager in a multinational business will
have to learn to understand it if he wants to function effectively
himself. The systems structure will never be a preferred form of
organization; it is fiendishly difficult. But it is an important
structure, and one that the organization designer needs to know and
needs to understand—if only to know that it should not be used where
other, simpler and easier structures will do the job.</p>
<h4 id="organization-conclusions">48 Organization Conclusions</h4>
<p>“Ideal Organization” or “Pragmatism”?—The Need to Test
Assumptions—The Need for Simplicity—Focus on Key Results and Key
Activities—The Test: The Performance of People</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>RGANIZATION THEORISTS HAVE ARGUED for design should start out with an
“ideal organization” or</p>
<p>years whether organization whether it should be “prag-</p>
<p>matic.” Should “principles” come first? Or should the first
consideration be “fit” to the special needs, the exceptional situations,
the habits and traditions of an organization?</p>
<p>Our discussion of organizational building blocks, of design
specifications, and of de- sign principles leads to the conclusion that
the argument is pointless. Both approaches are needed and have to be
used in parallel. Organization design has to be grounded in an “ideal
organization,” that is, a conceptual framework. There has to be careful
work on defining and delineating the structural principles. This work,
in turn, must be grounded in the mission and purpose of the business,
its objectives, its strategies, its priorities, its key activities. But
there is no universal design principle. There is not even a best design
prin- ciple. Each principle makes stringent demands and has severe
limitations. Each has only limited scope; none embrace operating work,
top-management work, and innovation work in one design.</p>
<p>Reality, in all its complexity, therefore has to be probed in
designing organization. It has to be understood. The assumptions that
are being made, and especially the assump- tions that underlie the
“ideal organization design” have to be tested and validated. These
assumptions are always eminently plausible to the people within a
company. They are often held subconsciously—but their hold is all the
stronger for that. As long as one could assume that organization design
meant one basic principle or a combination of two (i.e., functional and
federal structures), development of an ideal organization could be
consid- ered the logical first step. Everybody knew of course that no
ideal organization could ever be achieved in reality; reality always
demands concessions, compromises, and exceptions. But one could hope to
come close to the ideal—with exceptions truly “exceptional,” that is,
infrequent and confined to purely local situations.</p>
<p>One can no longer assume this. The testing of basic assumptions
regarding organiza- tional reality has to proceed parallel to the
conceptual thinking about organization. Oth- erwise one ends up with an
ideal organization that, while “conceptually pure,” is inap- propeiate
and stultifies.</p>
<p>Two examples, both from the same major organizing task, illustrate
this:</p>
<p>In the GE organization of the early fifties, it was “obvious” to
everyone that any unit charged with “product responsibility” was
actually a “manufacturing business.” Yet as said before, there were
quite a few units that manufactured nothing but had been set up to
develop a new process or a new product line. These units had a
“customer”; they had “revenue” usually a governmental research and
development contract~ they had “per- formance responsibility.” But they
were not manufacturing businesses but innovative or-</p>
<p>ganizations. To set them up on the functional design of the typical
manufacturing business stifled them. This would have been clear to
everyone had the ideal design been tested. But it was far too obvious
for that.</p>
<p>The other GE assumption was that the general manager of a product
business would be an operating manager, as are the heads of the
automotive divisions of General Motors on which GE modeled its design.
But all GM automotive divisions are alike. GM, while a multi-market
business, is, in effect, a single-product business. GE, however, is one
of the most diversified companies in the world, in its technologies, its
processes, its products, and its markets. And most of GE’s product
businesses are the leaders in separate, distinct, large industries. The
GE general manager, therefore, is top management rather than oper- ating
management (on this see Chapter 51). Again, testing the assumptions
would have shown this at once. But without such a test GE set up general
managers, who did not have the team they needed to do their
top-management work, and autonomous businesses far too small in volume
and scope to support the top management they needed. That GE has been
constantly reorganizing its supposedly “definitive” organization
structure—in sharp contrast to the stability of Alfred Sloan’s design
for GM—is in large measure the result of failure to test plausible
assumptions.*</p>
<p>The approach to organization design through the ideal organization
structure, i.e., through a conceptual model, is not “theory.” It is
eminently practical. But the pragmatic approach through explicit
definition of assumptions and their testing in the reality of the
organization is not “muddling through” or “patchwork.” It is
theoretically sound in a situation in which there are conceptual
alternatives. Organization design is both concept and experimental
validation—or it is faulty design.</p>
<p>The Need for Simplicity</p>
<p>The simplest organization structure that will do the job is the best
one. What makes an organization structure “good” are the problems it
does not create. The simpler the struc- ture, the less that can go
wrong.</p>
<p>But there is neither a perfect nor a universal design principle. All
of them have limita- tions. Even the simplest business—a small- to
medium-sized company with one major product line for one major
market—will use at least two design principles: functional de- sign and
teams, the latter for top-management and innovative work and as a
complement to functionally organized work.</p>
<p>And to use, for the sake of simplicity or symmetry, a design
principle beyond its in- herent limits is asking for trouble.</p>
<p>To use functional structure for tasks for which team structure is
needed, in knowledge work or for genuine innovation, for instance, makes
for a “clean” structure. But it also makes for nonperformance.
Conversely, to use teams as the structural units for unchang- ing,
large-scale functional work causes only confusion. Jobs, in such work,
can then be— and often should be done in teams; but the work itself
always has to be specific and spe- cialized. And to set up a federally
decentralized unit that is not a genuine business will only confuse; for
all its limitations simulated decentralization will have to be used.</p>
<p>Some design principles are more difficult and problematical than
others. But none is without difficulties and problems. None is primarily
people-focused rather than task- focused; none is more “creative,”
“free,” or “more democratic.” Design principles are tools; and tools are
neither good nor bad in themselves. They can be used properly or
improperly; and that is all. To obtain both the greatest possible
simplicity and the greatest “fit,” organization design has to start out
with a clear focus on key activities needed to produce key results. They
have to be structured and positioned in the simplest possible design.
Above all, the architect of organization needs to keep in mind the
purpose of the structure he is designing. Organization is a means to an
end rather than an end itself. Sound structure is a prerequisite to
organizational health; but it is not health itself. The</p>
<p>*Since these remarks may be read as criticism of the work at GE, it
needs to be said that the author was closely connected with it; and what
seems so obvious now had yet to be learned in the early fifties.</p>
<p>test of a healthy business is not the beauty, clarity, or perfection
of its organization struc- ture. It is the performance of people.</p>
<h4 id="georg-siemens-and-the-deutsche-bank">49 Georg Siemens and the
Deutsche Bank</h4>
<p>Top Management: Rank or Function—Georg Siemens and the “Universal
Bank”— Top-Management Tasks—Top-Management Team—The “Secretariat”—The
Lessons</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>OP MANAGEMENT IS A simply another term for the</p>
<p>FACT. But is its essence power? Is “top management” “bosses”? Or is
there a specific top-management func-</p>
<p>tion? And if so, what is it and how should it be structured?</p>
<p>Management theory is generally silent on the function and structure
of top manage- ment. But in management practice this was the very first
area tackled systematically— long before Frederick W. Taylor tackled the
organization of work, and long before Henri Fayol developed the first
systematic organization design in his functional structure. Top
management as a function and as a structure was first developed by Georg
Siemens (1839-1901) in Germany between 1870 and 1880, when he designed
and built the Deutsche Bank and made it, within a very few years, into
continental Europe’s leading and most dynamic financial institution. (On
Siemens, see also Chapters 1 and 29.)</p>
<p>The management books usually mention that the emergence of the
transcontinental railroad in the U.S. during the 1870s first created
need for, and awareness of, manage- ment. The books fail to mention—and
their authors usually do not know—that at the same time there emerged on
the continent of Europe an institution, the “universal bank,” which,
while totally different from the large railroad, equally posed a problem
of managing a large and geographically dispersed organization. The
railroads problem was organization and coordination of operations; the
universal bank’s problem was organization aud coor- dination of top
management.</p>
<p>The universal bank grew out of the banque d’affaires, the
entrepreneurial bank which was intended, in accordance with the
doctrines of the French economists and sociologists from J.B. Say to
Saint-Simon, to be the motor of economic and social development by
directing the capital resources of the economy into tomorrow’s
productive growth indus- tries. The first banque d’affaires, the Crédit
Mobilier, which the Pereire Brothers founded in Paris in 1850, proved
the theory.* But as a bank it was a failure. It lacked the deposit base
and the commercial banking business to sustain itself while its
industrial investments matured and therefore had to go into “growth
situations” and “go-go stocks,” that is, into speculation rather than
industrial development.</p>
<p>The lesson was heeded across the Rhine, in Germany, where economic
development was just starting in the 1860s. The Germans proceeded to
start banks which would be industrial-development banks (that is,
banques d’affairs) but which would, like the older English “commercial”
banks, also have a broad deposit base and a commercial-banking
business—hence the name universal bank.</p>
<p>*On the Pereire Brothers and the Crédit Mobilier, see my books,
Managing for Results and The Age of Discon- tinuity.</p>
<p>Of the many such banks started in Germany at that time, Deutsche Bank
had the most pretentious title. Actually there was as yet no Deutschland
when it was founded early in 1870; Bismarck’s unification of Germany was
still a year in the future. But despite its grandiose title and its
avowed intention of becoming the first truly “national” bank in Europe,
the new Deutsche Bank was the smallest, the most poorly capitalized, and
the most precariously backed of the new German banking ventures. It was
indeed so unprom- ising that no experienced and established banker could
be found to head it. The founders had to turn for the leadership of
their new business to a thirty-year-old and virtually un- known
government lawyer without banking or business experience: Georg
Siemens.</p>
<p>Within ten years Siemens had built the Deutsche Bank into Germany’s
leading finan- cial institution. Within another five years, by the
mid-eighties, the Deutsche Bank had become the giant among the credit
institutions of the European continent.</p>
<p>Building a Top-Management Team</p>
<p>What Siemens did was to build a top management—the first such organ
in economic and business history. Siemens himself, many years later,
summed up his approach in an epi- gram: “A bank without an effective
top-management is so much office furniture, fit only to be auctioned
off.”</p>
<p>The old merchant firms of Hamburg and Bremen, which were the “modern”
busi- nesses of a still predominantly pre-industrial Germany, were, of
course, family partner- ships as a rule, with a team of brothers or of
father and son at the head. Siemens trans- formed this partnership of
co-owners into a top-management team of professionals.</p>
<p>He analyzed the key activities of the bank and made sure that each of
them was an as- signed responsibility of one member of the team. He
analyzed the key relations of the bank, with major investments and major
customers, or with such major outside factors as governments, and again
made sure that one member of the top-management team was responsible for
each of them. There was, of course, a captain of the management team—
Siemens himself for many years filled that position. But whichever
member of the team had designated responsibility for a key activity
(e.g., underwriting) or for a key relation- ship (e.g., with one of the
major industrial investments) was in charge, was directly and primarily
responsible, and made the decisions. Even Siemens, while chairman of the
“board of management” and clearly first man on the team, was, in many
areas, the number two man who served as alternate to the colleague in
charge.</p>
<p>Who did what, and who was responsible for what, was decided on the
basis of a man’s personality, his interests, his qualifications, and his
load. The job had to fit the man. At the same time, great care was taken
to have every key activity and every key relationship “covered,” that
is, assigned as a primary responsibility to one of the team members.</p>
<p>So far Siemens may be said to have done little but define the
functions of the board of management of German company law. But Siemens
soon went far beyond this and organ- ized a top-management team grounded
in function rather than in law.</p>
<p>Unlike France, where the banque d’affaires had its origin, Germany
did not have then, and does not have today, one major city in which
governmental and economic activities are centralized. Even in the 1920s,
when Berlin was at its peak, most of the large German industrial
companies did not have their headquarters there. Only the electrical
industry was dominated by Berlin-based companies.</p>
<p>Such centers as Hamburg, Frankfurt, and Munich were much older than
Berlin. They had been capital cities when Berlin was still a fishing
village. Their citizens, and espe- cially their leading businessmen, had
intense civic pride and were not at all willing to be controlled from
Berlin. Yet the Deutsche Bank, if it wanted to carry out its function as
the German entrepreneur, had to become a national rather than remain a
regional or a local bank. Also the new industrial business of the
rapidly growing German economy soon be- gan to be national, with plants,
branches, and customers throughout the country.</p>
<p>Hence Siemens had to work out a national top-management team of which
the bank’s leading executives in major centers outside of Berlin could
be members. These men were</p>
<p>not legally members of the top management, that is, of the board of
management (Vor- stand). But internally they were members of the
top-management teams. They were re- sponsible for the bank’s relations
with the major businesses in their area. With industry largely outside
of Berlin these men often carried the responsibility for the bank’s
major industrial investments and major business relationships. As late
as 1926, when the Ger- man chemical industry merged into the I.G.
Farben, and established its corporate head- quarters in Frankfurt, the
Deutsche Bank’s top man in Frankfurt assumed, for instance, primary
responsibility for the relationship with what then was Germany’s largest
and most</p>
<p>important industrial corporation.</p>
<p>As a result, outstanding men in the various communities were willing
to serve the bank in local leadership positions when they would neither
have moved to Berlin nor have been content with subordinate jobs. And
strong local banks were willing to merge with</p>
<p>the Deutsche Bank for the same reason.</p>
<p>The “Secretariat”</p>
<p>Such a large, widely dispersed, and dynamic team created at once a
major communica- tions problem. How to keep all the members informed
(their number may have reached twenty-five or thirty-five at times)? How
to keep control of the business of the bank once it had grown beyond
financing a few companies and had actually become the national
entrepreneur its founders had expected it to be? How to keep control of
the allocation of the bank’s resources of capital and key people? How
altogether to prevent under this top- management system a breakup of a
unified bank into a series of semi-independent fief- doms? Georg
Siemens’s answer to this was the creation of the executive secretariat
(Di- rektions-Sekretariat).*</p>
<p>Siemens assembled a small professional staff and charged it with the
responsibility for keeping all members of the top-management teams
informed of each other’s activitses and decisions, for thinking ahead
for the bank as a whole, and for staying in close touch with every major
investment and commitment.</p>
<p>Georg Siemens’s Lessons</p>
<p>This example teaches, first, that there is a top-management function.
There are a number of tasks which are top-management tasks, not because
top management is the “top”—that is, because it has the legal authority
or the power—but because they are tasks that can be discharged only by
people who are capable of seeing the whole business and of making
decisions with respect to the whole business.</p>
<p>Secondly, the story of the Deutsche Bank under Georg Siemens
demonstrates that top management requires a specific structure. It is a
different organ from any other organ of management and has to have a
different design.</p>
<p>Finally, the story shows that top management requires its own organ
of input, its own organ for the supply of stimulation, information, and
thought.</p>
<p>*Without any knowledge of Siemens’s work the National Aeronautics and
Space Agency (NASA) almost a hundred years later, in the 1960s, arrived
at the same solution of an executive secretariat to maintain communi-
cation, information, and cohesion in a systems structure. On this see
Sayles and Chandler, op. cit.</p>

Intermittent Tasks—Required: A Diversity of Capabilities and
Temperaments—Top-Management Tasks and Chief-Executive Styles—The
Top-Management Work Plan</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>VERY MANAGERIAL UNIT other than top management is designed for one
spe- cific major task—whether the organization is structured on
functional lines, in teams, on the basis of decentralization, or on the
systems approach. Every building block of organization is defined by a
specific contribution.</p>
<p>The one exception is top management. Its job is multidimensional.
There is no top- management task; there are only top-management tasks.
And this is just as true for public- service institutions as it is for
businesses.</p>
<p>Since each of the management tasks has been identified earlier in
this book, what fol- lows is mainly recapitulation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is, first, the task of thinking through the mission of the
business, that is, of asking the question “What is our business and what
should it be?” This leads to the setting of objectives, the development
of strategies and plans, and the making of today’s deci- sions for
tomorrow’s results. This clearly can be done only by an organ of the
business that can see the entire business; that can make decisions that
affect the entire business; that can balance objectives and the needs of
today against the needs, of tomorrow; and that can allocate resources of
men and money to key results.</p></li>
<li><p>There is need for standard setting, example setting, i.e., for
the conscience func- tions. There is need for an organ of the enterprise
which concerns itself with the gap— always a big one—between what the
organization stands for and what it actually does. There is a need for
an organ concerned with vision and values in the key areas. Again this
can only be an organ of the enterprise that sees and comprehends the
entire business.</p></li>
<li><p>There is the responsibility to build and maintain the human
organization. There is need for work on developing the human resources
for tomorrow, and especially for work on providing tomorrow’s top
management. The spirit of an organization is created by the people at
the top. Their standards of conduct, their values, their beliefs, set
the example for their entire organization and determine its
self-respect.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is need also for thinking through organization structure and
organization design.</p>
<p>This requires someone, or a group of people, who can see the entire
business and can make decisions in contemplation of the entire
business.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Equally important are major relations which only the people at the
top of a business can establish and maintain. They may be relations to
customers or major suppliers. They</li>
</ol>
<p>may be industry relations or relations with bankers and the financial
community. They may be relations to governments or other outside
institutions. These relations crucially affect the capacity of the
business to perform. And they are relations that can be made, again,
only by somebody who represents the entire business, speaks for it,
stands for it, commits it.</p>
<p>Out of these relations emerges a host of top-management policy
decisions and ac- tions—on the environment and on the social impact of a
business; on its employment policies and on its position on proposed
legislation.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>There are countless “ceremonial” functions—dinners, civic events,
etc.—that are actually more time-consuming and less easy to avoid for
the top people in a small or me- dium-sized business that is prominent
in its focal community than they are for the heads of the very big
companies.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the head of a fair-sized company said, “As long as the president
of General Electric sends a check he can be represented by one of his
vice-presidents—and he has sixty-five of them. I have to go myself; we
are the largest employers in the place.”</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>There is also need for a “stand-by” organ for major crises, for
somebody who is available to take over when things go seriously wrong.
Then it is the most experienced, the wisest, the most prominent people
in an organization who have to roll up their sleeves and go to work.
They are legally responsible. But there is also a responsibility of
knowl- edge—and it cannot be abdicated.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is still a partial list only. It should prove, however, that the
top-management task will not get done unless it is recognized as a
distinct function, a distinct kind of work, and organized as such.</p>
<p>But this list also shows that while there is a genuine top-management
function there is no general formula for the top-management tasks.</p>
<p>Every business, indeed every institution, needs a top-management
function. But every one has specific top-management tasks. The elements
of the job are the same. But the specific top-management tasks are
particular to an individual business. They have to be developed out of a
specific analysis of the mission and purpose of the institution, its ob-
jectives, its strategies, and the key activities. The question to ask is
not “What is top man- agement?” The question is “What are the specific
things to be done in this business which are of crucial importance to
the success and survival of the business and which can be done only by
top management?” “What are the specific things which can be done only by
people who see this business whole; who can balance the present needs of
the business against the needs of the future; and who can make final and
effective decisions?”</p>
<p>It therefore makes little sense to talk of an “ideal” top-management
structure—as a good many of the books on the subject do. The ideal top
management is the one that does the things that are right and proper for
its enterprise here and now. We need, to be sure, a theory of top
management. But the specific application must be developed concretely,
indeed pragmatically. It, must be tailored to the individual enterprise.
It must be devel- oped from an analysis of the specific enterprise. It
must, above all, follow the strategies of the enterprise and be in
harmony with them.</p>
<p>To “Operate” or Not to “Operate”</p>
<p>Only the analysis of the individual business (or public-service
institution) will bring out what key activities are properly
top-management responsibilities.</p>
<p>The management texts agree that top management should not “operate.”
And most in- formed observers of top management agree that the most
common reason why the top- management job doesn’t get done is that top
executives “operate” and, in consequence, do not tackle the
top-management tasks.</p>
<p>Yet Georg Siemens in his top-management design included a good deal
of “operating work.” He did not confine his top management to directing
others, to planning, to review-</p>
<p>ing, to setting the direction of his Bank. On the contrary, the first
job of the members of his top-management team was specific work on the
major industrial and financial invest- ments the bank had decided to
develop. It was not “directing” the work of others but “do- ing.” Far
from isolating themselves from the “nuts and bolts,” Siemens’s top men
were supposed to take direct personal responsibility for finding the
right investment opportuni- ties and for developing them into
successful, well-managed businesses. Clearly this was one of the secrets
of the success of the Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p>Effective top managements tend to follow the Siemens practice rather
than the theo- rist’s and consultant’s preaching.</p>
<p>Here are some examples. A medium-sized French producer of branded and
nationally advertised consumer goods has gained, within the last decade
or two, a strong position in the European markets. One of the reasons is
that the head of the company is also the com- pany’s advertising and
promotion manager. He himself writes most of the company’s ad-
vertisements and designs the company’s promotions. He also has assigned
to himself di- rect responsibility for relations with the dealers
throughout Europe, and especially throughout France. He personally
visits about thirty of the larger dealers in the course of a year,
listens to them, studies their businesses, and altogether manages the
company’s rela- tionship with them. “Our business is a promotion
business. Our business, above all, de- pends on the willingness of the
dealers to work hard at selling our merchandise. Our busi- ness,
therefore, depends on our knowing the dealers and their knowing us, and
on our willingness and ability to design products they want to sell and
can sell, to deliver them the way they need them delivered, and to price
them in line with the price preferences of their customers.” Yet the
same man flatly refuses to have anything to do with manufactur- ing—even
though his own background is manufacturing engineering.</p>
<p>Work on major innovations may be such an “operating” top-management
task at a given stage of a company’s development.</p>
<p>A large pharmaceutical company, for instance, decided to broaden its
base. It had long held leadership in one major area but decided that its
product base was too narrow. It identified several new areas in which it
expected to become an important factor, each re- quiring the development
of new drugs. In each of the three areas it selected one of the members
of top management moved in as a member—but not the leader—of the
“project team” formed to develop the new products and to develop the new
business. In the early stages leadership in the task force rested, of
necessity, with the research scientists. But even then the
top-management member of the project team actively worked, thinking
through the marketing strategies, working on medical testing and on
obtaining approval from the government regulatory agencies involved;
planning the changes necessary in the sales, force to enable the company
to move into fields in which it had no acceptance by the medical
profession as a reliable supplier.</p>
<p>This work, it was felt, and rightly so, was so crucial to the future
of the company and, at the same time, involved so many basic and
difficult decisions, that a member of top management had to gain direct
working experience in the field for the whole group to be able to make
the necessary decisions and take the necessary action.</p>
<p>Another example: Sears, Roebuck is a company which, from its early
days, has in- sisted on keeping top management out of operations, and
confined to top-management tasks. No one believed in this more firmly
than General Wood. Yet when Wood systema- tized the top-management job
and organized a three-man top-management team, he as- signed to top
management as a “doing” responsibility the selection of sites for new
major retail stores. This decision, he argued, had long-range and
irreversible impact on the com- pany’s ability to sell and to make
money. Once the site has been selected and a store has been built, there
is a twenty-year commitment. A decision like this, though clearly an op-
erating decision, has to be made by top management. And to be able to
make the decision intelligently, a member of top management has to work
on the project from the beginning.</p>
<p>These are clearly dangerous precedents. If operating work can be
legitimately in- cluded in the top-management job, then chief executives
who open all the incoming letters or who themselves do the final
inspection of the company’s products—and I have seen</p>
<p>both done, and in fairly large businesses—can claim that they are
doing top-management work (as indeed both did).</p>
<p>The rules are simple:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is not top-management work if someone else can do it. Of
course, most operating work will be eliminated as top-management work by
the analysis of key activities; for top management should never be
involved in any other activities. But key activities should then be
subjected to the question “Could anyone else in the organization do them
just as well—or nearly as well? At least, should there be someone
capable of doing them?” If the answer is yes, it is not top-management
work.</p></li>
<li><p>People who move into top-management work should, further, give up
the functional or operating work they did earlier. That should always be
turned over to someone else. Otherwise they are likely to remain
functional or operating people.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But it is not in itself a final argument against inclusion of this or
that task in the top- management function to say, “This is operating
work.” The many executives who, despite all the exhortations in the
books, continue to operate, have a sound instinct. But if they do not
subject the top-management job to a searching analysis of key
activities, they will do the wrong operating work. They will do the
things they are familiar with and like to do. They will do the things
they have always done. And they will slight the “operating” work that
actually belongs in the top-management job.</p>
<p>The Characteristics of Top-Management Tasks</p>
<p>The top-management function is singularly difficult to organize.
Every one of the tasks is a recurrent task. It needs to be done over and
over again. But very few of them, if any, are continuous tasks. Very few
of them have to be done every day from nine to five. When they arise,
they are of crucial importance to the enterprise. They are the true
“life and death” decisions. But it would be foolish to “plan” five days
a week fifty-two weeks a year. Key personnel decisions also arise fairly
infrequently. But then they require a great deal of time; few things are
less likely to succeed than hasty personnel decisions. And the same
applies to most of the other top-management tasks.</p>
<p>But individuals require a continuing day-to-day job. They do little
work, as a rule, unless they work steadily.</p>
<p>Another peculiar characteristic of top-management tasks is that they
require a diver- sity of capabilities, and, above all, of temperaments.
They require the capacity to analyze, to think, to weigh alternatives,
and to harmonize dissent. But they also require the capac- ity for quick
and decisive action, for boldness and for intuitive courage. They
require be- ing at home with abstract ideas, concepts, calculations, and
figures. They also require perception of people, a human awareness, and
empathy and altogether a lively interest in people and respect for them.
Some tasks demand that a man work by himself, and alone. Others are
tasks of representation and ceremonial, outside tasks, that require the
politi- cian’s enjoyment of crowds and protocol; the ability to
represent and to make a good im- pression by saying nothing.</p>
<p>The top-management tasks require at least four different kinds of
human being: the “thought man,” “the action man,” the “people man,” and
the “front man.” Yet those four temperaments are almost never found in
one person.</p>
<p>Failure to understand these characteristics is a main reason why the
top-management task is so often done poorly or not at all.</p>
<p>Because the tasks, while continuing, are not continuous, the
top-management job itself is often seen, even by people running sizable
businesses, as something that will be done if and when the need arises.
But in the meantime, that is, day by day, the people at the top feel the
need to do a continuing job. That, of course, means that they do
functional work. For there is day-to-day work in manufacturing and
marketing, in accounting and engineer-</p>
<p>ing, in advertising and in quality control. And the top-management
tasks will not get done at all. There are simply too many of them to be
done that way. While each individual task within the top-management
function may require only a comparatively limited amount of time in the
smaller and less complicated business, the totality of the
top-management function, even in the small business, is far too large to
be handled on the side and in addi- tion to functional work. Day-by-day
operating work always has urgency—and many top- management jobs are for
the long pull and look as if they can wait until the “tomorrow” that
never comes.</p>
<p>In addition, the top man, even in the large business, tends to see
only those parts of the top-management function which are congenial to
him. They will then constitute for him the top-management job—and it
will get done. The top man is right when he assigns to himself those
top-management tasks that fit his personality, his temperament, his
experi- ence. He is wrong, however, in believing, often without
conscious thought, that this takes care of the top-management function.
It actually makes the business unbalanced and likely to be out of
control.</p>
<p>The first requirement of effective top management, as Georg Siemens
saw a century ago is to identify objectively all the key activities and
key tasks of top management in the</p>
<p>business. The old saw that “every chief executive has his own style
and decides what top management is” is nonsense. Every chief
executive—indeed, every person—has his own style and is entitled to it.
But what decides what top management is or should be is an objective
decision. It depends no more on individual style than—the law of gravity
de- pends on what the physicist had for breakfast.</p>
<p>The fact that the top-management tasks, or at least a good many of
them, while con- tinuous tasks, are not continuous work and the fact
that the top-management tasks demand a diversity of qualifications,
skills, and temperaments make it essential that every top- management
task be clearly assigned to someone. Otherwise, important tasks will be
overlooked. In fact, there should be a top-management work
plan—especially in the small business—which spells out in considerable
detail who is responsible for what; what the objectives and goals are
with respect to each task, and what the deadlines are. Precisely because
the top-management function differs in basic character from practically
every other kind of work within the enterprise, it has to be specific
and has to be clearly as- signed.</p>

<p>T</p>
<p>OP-MANAGEMENT WORK IS WORK FOR A TEAM rather than for one man. It is
quite unlikely that any one man will, in his own person, unite the
divergent tem- peraments which the job requires. Moreover, it will be
found, when the top- management tasks are analyzed, that there is more
work to be done than any one man can do. The tasks require, except in
the smallest business, at least one full-time man who does nothing else,
and then one or two, at least for a major part of their time, who take
on part of the task in which they are then the “leaders” and have
primary responsibility.</p>
<p>There are additional reasons why the one-man top management tends to
malfunction.</p>
<p>Every top-management succession in a one-man top management is a
“crisis” and a des- perate gamble. No one in the business except the
former top man has really done the top- management work and proven
himself in it.</p>
<p>To recognize the team nature of the top-management job is
particularly important in the small business. The one-man top management
is a major reason why businesses fail to grow. (On this, see Chapter
60.)</p>
<p>But the job itself is a team job to begin with. Whatever the titles
on the organization chart, the top-management job in a healthy company
is almost always actually done by a team.</p>
<p>Henry Ford, as has been said (in Chapter 29, “Why Managers?”), did
not believe in managers at all, and this, in large part, explains the
decline and near-collapse of his com- pany in his latter years. But, as
recent studies have brought out (especially Allan Nevins’s Ford, the
Times, the Man, the Company [Scribner,1954]), the Ford Motor Company at
the time of its growth and success, that is, from 1907 through the early
twenties, was in effect run by a true top-management team with James
Couzens co-equal to Ford and the final authority in a great many and
clearly assigned top-management areas. After Couzens left—he later
entered politics and became a greatly beloved liberal senator from
Michigan in the New Deal days—Henry Ford became a one-man top
management. It is hardly coin- cidence that from that day on the Ford
Motor Company began to go downhill.</p>
<p>On paper the top management of a company may look like a one-man job.
But if the company is healthy, a closer look is likely to disclose that
other people carry clearly as- signed top-management responsibilities as
well. The controller often takes on a part of the top-management
function—usually the analytical, the planning, the objective-setting as-
pects. Or it is the manufacturing man who takes on responsibility for
the human organiza- tion in addition to his functional duties.</p>
<p>This works reasonably well as long as the business is simple and
small. The larger and more complex business needs a clearly structured
top-management team.</p>
<p>This team may be organized, as has become the fashion, as a
“president’s office,” in which a number of people serve as equals, each
with his own assigned area of primary responsibility within which he has
final say. This is the structure Siemens designed; and for the large and
complex business it is probably the best one—though it is not an easy
one.</p>
<p>It is essentially the structure which the organization builders of
the twenties at Du Pont, Standard Oil of New Jersey, Royal Dutch/Shell,
and Unilever evolved—probably without ever having heard of Georg
Siemens.</p>
<p>Put it is also possible to have one man only, a president or a
chairman, who carries the title of chief executive officer. He has then
affiliated with him a small number of col- leagues, perhaps with some
such title as executive vice-president, each of whom has clearly
assigned authority and responsibility for a part of the top-management
task, and no other duties.</p>
<p>Or, to cite another fairly common structure, there may be a three- or
four-man top, with each man carrying clearly assigned top-management
responsibilities even though one man is definitely number one. This is
the structure which General Motors has had for fifty years—a chairman, a
vice-chairman, a chairman of the executive committee, a president. What
, assignments each of these four men carries is then worked out to fit
their person- alities. But the four positions are permanent.</p>
<p>And there are many variations on these themes.</p>
<p>But just because the organization chart shows a top-management team
does not neces- sarily mean that there is one. There is need for
safeguards against the danger of dictator- ships disguised as a
top-management team.</p>
<p>The best proof is what happened to Siemens’s own concept in Germany.
The German Company Law, enacted in 1887, largely as a result of
Siemens’s work, provided for a Vorstand, i.e., a top-management team.
But many German companies, especially in the period between 1900 and
World War II, were run by an autocratic Generaldirektor be- cause the
other members of the Vorstand—contrary to Siemens’s rule—had full-time
functional assignments. Few of these companies were well-managed or did
well.</p>
<p>The only effective guard is to have every top-management task clearly
lodged in a man with direct and primary responsibility for it. And in
the larger company no one who carries any top-management responsibility
should carry any responsibility that is not part</p>
<p>of the top-management job.</p>
<p>The same lesson is being taught by a more recent and perhaps less
serious top- management malfunction, the operating “group executive” who
is supposed to “give part of his time” to the top-management job.</p>
<p>The group executive in charge of a number of divisions who has become
popular in large companies is supposed to be the operating head of his
group but give some of his time—a common figure is 30 percent—to the
company’s top-management tasks. This sounds plausible—but it has not
worked out. The group executive is far too busy to have clearly assigned
responsibility for a top-management task. As a result, he makes no top-
management contribution.</p>
<p>One company that has recognized this is IBM. IBM has group executive
for major ar- eas (research, engineering, and manufacturing; domestic
marketing and service; interna- tional; and non-computer businesses).
But it also has a four-man management committee composed of the
chairman, the president, and two senior officers, none of whom operates.
Each of the four has clearly assigned top-management responsibilities
and no other func- tion.</p>
<p>And yet the group executive is a member of a top-management team.
Only it is not the top-management team of the parent company. It is the
top-management team of the divi- sions in his group, each a major and
important autonomous business in its own right, and each therefore
requiring its own top management.</p>
<p>This was largely the way GE managers worked their way out of the
mistaken designa- tion of the general manager of a product business as
an operating manager (see Chapter 46). The group executive became, in
effect, the leader of a top-management team for his group, and a member
of the top management of every one of the product businesses. But he
never functioned as a member of GE’s top management—which is what the
job had been designed to be.</p>
<p>How Many Top Managements?</p>
<p>In the large and complex business—and even more in the multinational
company—there are always several top managements rather than one. The
company as a whole is a busi- ness. But the autonomous division of a
federally organized company is also a business. It requires its own top
management, has its own top-management tasks, and its own key
activities.</p>
<p>Again Georg Siemens realized this a century ago. His Vorstand in
Berlin was one top- management group. Another one was composed of
members of the Berlin Vorstand and the key men in the major branches.
But every one of the major branches outside of Berlin had also a small
top-management team of its own. The Berlin team was, so to speak, the
first team. But every one of the provincial teams had responsibilities
in which it was “first,” and with respect to which Berlin was “support”
or “understudy.”</p>
<p>Indeed, it is one of the characteristics of complexity in a business
that it requires more than one top-management team—with clear
recognition of which of the teams has primary responsibility in what
area and with what limitations.</p>
<p>We can now summarize the basic specifications for a functioning
top-management structure:</p>
<p>• The starting point is an analysis of the top management tasks.</p>
<p>• Each top management task must be clearly assigned to someone who
has di- rect and full responsibility for it.</p>
<p>• This requires a top management team, with responsibilities assigned
to fit the personalities, qualifications, and temperaments of the
members.</p>
<p>• Whoever has assigned responsibility for a top-management activity
is “top management” whatever his title.</p>
<p>• Except in the small and simple business no one who has
top-management re- sponsibilities, does any but top-management work.</p>
<p>• The complex business requires more than one top management team,
each structured according to these rules.</p>
<p>Teamwork in Top Management</p>
<p>A top-management team has to satisfy stringent requirements to be
effective. It is not a simple structure. It will not work just because
its members like each other. Indeed whether the members like or dislike
each other is beside the point. A top-management team must function no
matter what the personal relationships between its members are.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, whoever has primary responsibility in a given area has, in
effect, the final say.</li>
</ol>
<p>To have a functioning top management requires further that no
subordinate can appeal a decision by one member of the team to another.
Every member speaks with the full au- thority of top management.</p>
<p>To deviate from this and to allow an appeal from one member of the
top-management group to another invites politicking. It undermines the
authority of the entire top- management group.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>No member will make a decision with regard to a matter for which he
does not have primary responsibility. Should such a matter be brought to
him, he will refer it to the col- league whose primary responsibility it
is. Indeed it is a wise precaution for members of</li>
</ol>
<p>the top-management team not even to have an opinion on matters that
are not within their own areas of primary responsibility.</p>
<p>Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., was the undoubted head of General Motors with
moral authority within GM’s general management such as has rarely been
equaled. Yet Sloan said again and again, “I think you’d better take this
matter up with Mr. Brown or with Mr. Bradley or with Mr. Wilson”—at that
time (the late forties) his colleagues in the top-management group. “I
would be interested to hear what they decide; perhaps you’ll let me
know.” Af- ter the caller had left—and the callers were usually high GM
executives—Sloan would sometimes take the telephone and quietly call up,
Mr. Brown and ask him to come to the office to discuss the matter. Sloan
usually had very definite opinions and fought for them. But he had
disciplined himself never to express an opinion outside the top group,
unless he himself had direct responsibility in the matter under
discussion.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Members of the top-management team need not like each other. They
need not even respect each other. But they must not agitate against each
other. In public, that is, outside top management’s conference room,
they have no opinions on each other, do not criticize each other, do not
belittle each other. Preferably they do not even praise each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>To enforce this rule is the team captain’s job—and he better be
strict about it. Even the most “temperamental” (i.e., undisciplined) man
must not be allowed, as a member of top management, to express in public
criticism, dislike, or contempt for any other mem- ber.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>A top-management team is not a committee. It is a team. A team needs
a captain.</li>
</ol>
<p>The team captain is not the “boss”; he is a leader.</p>
<p>There are several ways of determining the role of the team captain.
The president of Du Pont traditionally has just one vote and depends
primarily on his moral authority. At Standard Oil of New Jersey the
chairman traditionally did not even have this much legal power; for many
years votes, whenever taken, required unanimity. Alfred P. Sloan at
General Motors had the legal power to overrule his colleagues on the
management team. But he almost never used it. He made a decision after
he had made sure that he knew where every colleague on the
top-management team stood and that each, in turn, had fully grasped
where the chairman and chief executive officer stood. In other
top-management teams the senior man has the power of final decision, or
at least a veto power. In yet oth- ers, it is the team captain’s main
role to designate the member of the team who, in a par- ticular
situation, makes the final decision, which is then accepted by
everybody.</p>
<p>But there has to be a team captain. And in times of extreme crisis he
has to be willing and able—and has to have the legal power—to take over.
In times of common peril there has to be unity of command.</p>
<p>Key personnel decisions are made neither by acclamation nor by taking
a vote. They do require careful thought, careful discussion, and the
pooling of the experience of differ- ent people within the organization.
They are, properly, matters which top management considers as a group,
even though it will then often leave the actual decision to one of its
members.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>The top-management task requires systematic and intensive work on
communica- tions among the members of the top-management team. It
requires this precisely because there are so many different
top-management tasks, each, however, with decisive impact</li>
</ol>
<p>on the welfare of the entire organization. It requires it, above all,
because each member of top management should be able to operate with the
maximum of autonomy within his own sphere—and that can be granted him
only if he makes every effort to keep his colleagues fully informed.</p>
<p>Philip Young and Gerald Swope, who largely built the General Electric
Company in the twenties and thirties, formed a singularly effective
top-management team. Swope, headquartered in Schenectady, was concerned
with engineering; production, and selling; Young was in charge of
finance, government relations, international affairs, and public
responsibilities. The two men, legend has it, disliked each other and
rarely talked to each other. But they took great care to keep each other
informed of all their actions and activi- ties—everything that went on
in one office was known at the other office within a day or two. There
are some old-timers in GE who maintain that this impersonal but highly
organ- ized system worked better than the constant meetings and the
close personal association of the top-management teams that have
succeeded Swope and Young since World War II.</p>
<p>Respect for the task, and clear understanding of what it is and who
has responsibility, are, in other words, the foundations for an
effective top management.</p>
<p>How to Nourish the Brain</p>
<p>Siemens’s most distinct innovation in organizing the top management
was the “executive secretariat.” It may have been his most important
contribution.</p>
<p>The human brain absorbs almost half of all the oxygen and all the
energy in the body.</p>
<p>The five sense organs work directly for the brain and supply it with
stimuli. Altogether, the human body, it may be said, is organized first,
and above all, to nourish the brain, to supply it with stimulus and
energy.</p>
<p>One cannot expect a social body to equal the performance of a
biological organism, let alone of that marvel of flexibility, precision,
and economy, the functioning human body. But still one might wonder
whether the “brain” of the business enterprise, its top management, does
not need its own organ of nourishment, of stimulation, and of informa-
tion.</p>
<p>In most businesses all the world over there is a surfeit of data.
There are constant re- ports, there are studies, there are researches of
all kinds, there are presentations and meet- ings. Most of them are
intended for operating management and for its use. The staff ser- vices
within the typical business are set up to support the operating people.
Indeed, it is the theory of staffs that their job is to support,
service, and educate operating managers. Who then nourishes the brain,
who then serves top management?</p>
<p>What top managements get, by and large, are the same data, the same
information, the same stimuli that operating managers get. Yet there are
specific top-management tasks and specific top-management needs. Top
management’s needs are different in kind from those of the operating
people, if only because it is largely concerned with the future rather
than solely with the present, and with the whole business rather than
with any of its parts.</p>
<p>The questions “What is our business?” and “What should it be?” imply
a very differ- ent look at the present enterprise from the look on which
present objectives, present struc- ture, present assignments, and
therefore present information are being based. Genuine innovations never
fit existing organization structures, but fall, outside and beyond any
existing organization scope. And tomorrow’s key people should always be
picked for reasons different from those for which one yesterday picked
the key people of today.</p>
<p>A simple but telling example is that of a major manufacturer of
electrical apparatus.</p>
<p>Traditionally the company had been in the steam-turbine business, in
which it long held a leadership position. During World War II, it went
into jet engines, which at first were seen only as engines to power
aircraft, even though a jet engine, that is, a gas turbine, is just as
much a producer of electrical energy as a steam turbine. Then the
company went into the atomic energy field. Because each of these three
means of producing electricity had a different technological origin, and
at first also a different market, each was organ- ized as a separate
business. However, for the customer, the power company, the three
are</p>
<p>simply alternative ways of producing electricity. Any two of them
together will give an electric utility a complete power supply. But none
of the existing service staffs of the manufacturing company saw this, or
could have seen this. Their job, after all, was to ser- vice the
operating managements of each of the three divisions—the steam turbine,
the jet engine, and the atomic power divisions. The people who ran these
divisions saw their own product as the prime generator and expected to
get for it the lion’s share of the growth in electric-power generation.
A task force organized specifically to supply top management with new
thinking about tomorrow’s markets finally pointed out that these three
divisions were in the same business. By that time the company’s standing
in one of its major mar- kets had already been seriously eroded by the
failure to supply information and thinking for the top-management
job.</p>
<p>Georg Siemens’s specific solution, the German “executive
secretariat,” will not suit every company and every cultural tradition.
Yet every company, beyond the very small and simple one, needs a
specific organ to supply top management with thinking, with stimulation,
with questions, with knowledge and, above all, with information. Top
man- agement work is a specific kind of work. Any kind of work requires
the right tools; and the tools for the top-management job are
information, stimulation, analysis, and questions.</p>
<p>Georg Siemens’s “secretariat” was set up as a distinct career. Great
pains were taken to find the ablest, most brilliant, most intelligent
young men in the bank’s employ, or to recruit such men from the
universities or from government service. Then they stayed, as a rule, in
the secretariat. Very few of them were ever moved out into operating
work in the bank. A few made it into top management—but their number was
small too. As a result, the secretariat tended to become insulated.</p>
<p>This is still a weakness of the secretariat as it is being used in
Germany. But it is an unnecessary weakness and one that can be remedied.
The rule should be that no one gets into such a secretariat, that is,
into a group the purpose of which is to support top man- agement with
information, stimulation, and questions, unless he first has shown real
per- formance in actual work. A secretariat assignment should be
considered as a major train- ing position for men who, at a fairly early
age, have shown high capacity to perform.</p>
<p>No one should stay in the secretariat for more than a few years—five
to eight might be the upper limit. Then he should be moved back into a
position where he has to perform, that is, into an operating position
with direct and measurable responsibility for contribu- tion and
results.</p>
<p>The secretariat should always be kept small. It should be kept on key
activities rather than attempt to cover everything. It should be
expected to focus on the major needs of the business. Indeed its
first—and perhaps its most important—assignment is to identify and to
think through the major factors that affect the performance and results
of the business, the major factors that underlie the question, “What is
our business and what should it be?” It should always ask, “What
information does top management need to make its deci- sions?”</p>
<p>In countries in which “secretariat” has the connotation of low-level
paper-pushing clerks (as it has in English-speaking countries) the
function might well be called “business research.” But the function
should be clearly defined as an organ to serve top manage- ment. Its job
is to provide top management with the information it needs to work as an
effective team, and with the information and knowledge to prepare itself
today for the major decisions it has to face tomorrow.</p>
<p>No business can do better than its top management will permit; the
“bottleneck” is, af- ter all, always “at the head of the bottle.” Of all
the jobs in the enterprise the top- management job is the most difficult
one to organize. But it is also the most important one to organize.</p>

<p>D</p>
<p>IFFERENT COUNTRIES HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES for the organ that super-
vises top management, counsels it, reviews its decisions, and appoints
men into top- management positions—board of directors, supervisory
board, and conseil d’administration. Different countries provide for
different membership.</p>
<p>Members of management, for instance, cannot sit on the German
supervisory board but are permitted to do so under American, British,
and Japanese law. In France the top- management function is conceived as
delegated by the board of directors to one or several of its members so
that board membership is almost obligatory for membership in top
management. And there are other variants. Outside of countries of the
German-type com- pany law, where this is forbidden, it is not uncommon
to find boards in which member- ship is restricted to full-time members
of management. In Japan, for instance, the board is usually another name
for the top-management committee. In Great Britain there is a dis-
tinction between “executive” members of the board, that is,
top-management people, and “non-executive” members, that is, outsiders
who hold no official position in the company.</p>
<p>But there is one thing all boards have in common, regardless of their
legal position.</p>
<p>They do not function. The decline of the board is a universal
phenomenon of this century. Perhaps nothing shows it as clearly as that
the board, which, in law, is the governing or- gan of a corporation, was
always the last group to hear of trouble in the great business
catastrophes of this century.</p>
<p>This happened in the collapse of the Austrian Credit Anstalt, the
leading Austrian bank, which in 1931 triggered the first worldwide
monetary crisis and, within a few weeks, brought down the English pound.
It was equally true in the big German business failures of the early
thirties which led to the collapse of the German banking system and
which had a good deal to do with Hitler’s ascent to power. It was true
in the business col- lapses of the post-World War II period—Rolls-Royce
in England, the Penn-Central Rail- road in the United States, and the
catastrophic decline of Italy’s leading chemical com- pany, Monticatini,
in the mid-sixties. Only at the very last minute, if even then, did the
boards of these companies find out that things were not going well.</p>
<p>Whenever one of the “scandals” breaks, the board’s failure is blamed
on stupidity, negligence of board members, or on failure of management
to keep its board informed. But when such malfunction occurs with
unfailing regularity, one must conclude that it is the institution that
fails to perform rather than individuals.</p>
<p>The board, whatever its name and whatever its legal structure, has
become a fiction.</p>
<p>The law may still treat it as the sovereign organ of the
corporation—but, then, English legal rhetoric still treats the Queen as
an Absolute Monarch whose every whim is a com- mand. The reality,
however, is that boards are either simply management committees, or they
are ineffectual. Rather than decry the failure of individuals, we
therefore better ask “Why have boards, regardless of their legal
structure, lost their capacity to perform?”</p>
<p>In Georg Siemens’s day they apparently did perform. In fact, their
performance could be taken for granted—as it was by Siemens, who himself
served on quite a few boards and who, at the same time, worked closely
with the board of his own bank and treated it as an integral part of his
own top management.</p>
<p>One reason for the malfunction of the board is, of course, the
development of the large publicly held corporation. The original board,
whether American, English, French, or German, was conceived as
representing the owners. This was reality in the nineteenth century when
stock ownership, by and large, was concentrated among a few people or a
few groups, each holding a substantial share of the total. Each board
member had a siz- able stake in the enterprise. Each was able to devote
a good deal of time and attention to the company. Each sat on only a few
boards.</p>
<p>But large companies in advanced countries are no longer owned by a
small group.</p>
<p>Their legal ownership is held by many thousands of “investors.” The
boards no longer represent the owner, or indeed anyone in particular. As
a result, board membership has lost its rationale. People are invited to
sit on boards because of their name. Or worse, board members are
recruited from people who do business with a company, such as the
company’s bankers or the company’s lawyers. Above all, board members are
being re- cruited from among successful corporate executives—and in
return for the president of Company A accepting board membership at
Company B, the president of Company B accepts board membership at
Company A. These busy people do not have a large enough stake in the
company to justify their spending much time on it. Or, if they are doing
busi- ness with the company, they are understandably reluctant to probe
into its affairs, to ask inconvenient questions, or to appear critical.
They go through the motions. And they are likely to sit on so many
boards that they cannot really do their homework.</p>
<p>Another reason is that the board cannot be what the law in most
countries (other than those that followed the German law, e.g., Austria
and Switzerland) says it is. It cannot be the governing body of the
company. That is a full-time job. To try to do it on a part-time basis
means that only trivia will even be looked at, let alone discussed.</p>
<p>A final factor in the steady decline of the board has surely been
that top management, by and large, does not want a really effective
board. An effective board demands top- management performance and
removes top executives who do not perform adequately— this is its duty.
An effective board asks inconvenient questions. An effective board
insists on being informed before the event—this is its legal
responsibility. An effective board will not unquestioningly accept the
recommendations of top management but will want to know why. It will not
rubber-stamp the personnel decisions of top management but will want to
know, indeed to get personally acquainted with, alternative candidates
for senior appointments. An effective board, in other words, insists on
being effective. And this, to most top managements, appears to be a
restraint, a limitation, an interference with “man- agement
prerogatives,” and altogether a threat.</p>
<p>Why Top Management Needs an Effective Board</p>
<p>Many top managements will argue that there is nothing wrong with the
decline of the board. They are perfectly content to see the board become
a legal fiction. Indeed they would be perfectly willing to see the board
disappear altogether (and where the board is completely an “inside”
board, that is, controlled entirely by members of top management, the
board as such has disappeared).</p>
<p>But this is exceedingly short sighted. It is becoming increasingly
clear that top man- agement will not—and in the large corporation must
not—be permitted to operate without</p>
<p>an effective and strong board. The alternative to top management’s
developing an effec- tive board for its own needs and those of the
enterprise, is the imposition by society of the wrong kind of board,
especially on the large corporation. Such an imposed board will attempt
to control top management and to dictate direction and decision. It will
indeed become the “boss.” It must consider itself an adversary of top
management. It will not, indeed, cannot, act in the interest of the
enterprise. The first signs of this are clearly around us—indeed, it may
already be too late to reverse the trend.</p>
<p>The malfunction of the board first became apparent in the Germany of
the Weimar Republic. And it is Germany also where the first outside
control has been imposed on the boards of large companies, in the form
of “co-determination,” that is, of legally required worker
representation on the board, first for companies in the coal and stee1
industries and then for all large businesses. Of course, no worker
representative sits on German company boards; the members are trade
union officials. But this does not alter the fact that the large-company
board in Germany today has become a battleground for contend- ing
factions.</p>
<p>A different development, but one pointing in the same direction, is
under way in Swe- den, where government now appoints members to boards
of the major banks. So far, peo- ple of stature and known integrity have
been selected by and large. But once there are political appointees on
the boards of individual companies, politics cannot be kept out of such
appointments for very long. As soon as this happens, the board ceases to
be able to work effectively as the review organ, the confidant, the
advisor, and guide of top man- agement. It becomes a regulator, an
adversary. (Sweden, since 1972, also requires that employee
representatives be elected to the boards of large companies, including
banks.)</p>
<p>The proposed statutes for the “European” company combine the German
and the Swedish approaches and call for boards controlled by government
and employee repre- sentatives.</p>
<p>In, the United States in the last few years there has been mounting
pressure to make boards “relevant,” that is, to appoint as board members
representatives of all kinds of groups: Blacks, women, the poor, and so
on. These appointees, no matter how distin- guished the individual,
cannot function as board members. Their role is to represent this or
that outside group, this or that special interest. Their role must be to
make demands on top management and to push special projects, special
needs, and special policies. They cannot be concerned with, or
responsible for, the enterprise. Nor should they be expected to hold in
confidence what they hear at board meetings; in fact their trust is not
to the en- terprise but to their constituents outside.</p>
<p>These developments demonstrate that society will not allow top
management, and es- pecially top management of large and visible
businesses, to exercise its power without an appropriate and effective
board. The board, as it has been conceived originally—well over a
century ago—has indeed outlived its usefulness. This, however, makes it
an urgent top-management job to think through what kind of a board the
enterprise and its top man- agement need. The decay of the traditional
board has created a vacuum. It will not remain unfilled.</p>
<p>The Three Functions of the Board</p>
<p>There are actually three different tasks for which a company, and
especially a large one, needs a functioning board.</p>
<p>The big company is too important to society not to have a “control”
in its own struc- ture. Somebody has to make sure that top management
thinks through what the company’s</p>
<p>business is and what it should be. Somebody has to make sure that
objectives are being set and strategies are being developed. Somebody
has to look critically at the planning of the company, its
capital-investment policy, and its managed-expenditures budget. Some-
body has to monitor people decisions and organization problems and has
to be the “su- preme court.” Somebody has to watch the organization’s
spirit , has to make sure that it succeeds in utilizing the strengths of
people and in neutralizing their weaknesses, that it develops tomorrow’s
managers and that its rewards to managers, its management tools and
management methods strengthen the organization and direct it toward
objectives.</p>
<p>Without such an organ of review, top managernent has no way to
control itself. It has no true legitimacy. But management also needs
someone to talk to. Everybody within a company always wants something
from top management. And no outsider knows enough about the company, its
business and its people.</p>
<p>To have someone to talk to is, above all, a top-management need in
the small com- pany where top management otherwise tends to be isolated.
Small company manage- ments, without easy, continuous access to outside
advisors such as experienced lawyers and consultants, need to have
available to them a few people who are experienced, who can understand
the business, and who are not yet part of it. Small-company top manage-
ments need, therefore, a true board of directors—yet small companies, as
a rule, have even less of a functioning board than the large ones.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>An effective and functioning board is needed to remove a top
management that fails to perform. A board capable of removing
incompetent or nonperforming top manage- ments has, of course, real
power. But only a weak top management is afraid of it. And no</li>
</ol>
<p>society can tolerate top-management incompetence in its large
businesses. If top man- agements do not build boards that will remove a
weak and incompetent chief executives, government will take over the
job.</p>
<p>There is another alternative: the “takeover” by the “financial
raider.” Management ex- perts and economists have been telling us for a
long time that the top managements of large publicly held companies have
become immune to stockholder control and that only coronary thrombosis
or bankruptcy can dislodge a top management once it has established
itself. This no longer holds.* Top managements—most of them seemingly
all-powerful, seemingly deeply entrenched, seemingly in complete
control—have been toppled by stockholder revolts organized by the
financial raiders and their “takeover bids.” The raid- ers did not aim
at companies in trouble. They aimed in the main at companies that did
not live up to their potential, companies the top managements of which
did not perform ade- quately.</p>
<p>Unless top management builds into the company’s structure an
effective organ for its removal in case of nonperformance, the raider
and his takeover bid will become an ever- present threat. A jackal is
better than no scavenger.</p>
<p>Top executives are paid for performance. Their compensation is high
because it in- cludes a “risk premium.” In any large company, especially
where ownership is so widely diffused that there is no controlling
interest, it is the duty of the board to review top- management
performance regularly and in depth, and to remove top executives who do
not measure up to very high demands. And this requires both a board
familiar with the company, and a strong board.</p>
<p>*For an analysis of the “takeover wave” and its meaning, see the
essay “The New Markets and the New Entre- preneurs” in my book, Men,
Ideas and Politics; English title The New Markets.</p>
<p>The central fact is that the modern enterprise has a multiplicity of
constituencies. The shareholders are one. But they are no longer the
one, as traditional legal theory has it. Instead of being “owners” they
have become “investors.” The employees are clearly also such a
constituency, but they are not, as the German trade unions (or the
“industrial com- munity” laws in various Latin-American countries)
assert, the constituency. There are also the communities where a major
company has its plants. There are consumers, suppliers, and
distributors. All of them need to know what goes on in a major business
what its problems, its policies, and its plans are. The business needs
to be understood by them. Top management needs to be known by them,
respected by them, accepted by them. Top management needs even more,
perhaps, to understand what these constituencies want, understand,
misunderstand, see, question.</p>
<p>Big companies are spending enormous sums on public relations. Yet the
evidence is clear that they fail to make themselves understood by their
publics and, worse, that they fail to understand their publics. Public
relations as top-management press-agentry has failed. But this makes all
the more important genuine public and community relations, aimed at
understanding the public rather than at making it “love” a company and
its top management. This requires that top management have access to,
and can work with, peo- ple from these publics and constituencies whom
it respects, but who are independent— people who, in turn, respect top
management and know what it is trying to do. This means a public and
community relations board that is built into the enterprise’s structure
and functions as an integral organ of top management.</p>
<p>The German trade unionist or the American consumer advocate has a
point when he pushes for board representation for his constituency. He
is wrong only in believing that his constituency is the constituency; it
is one of many.</p>
<p>The governing board of directors must be a board that represents no
one except the basic long-term interests of the enterprise. It must be
capable of discharging its function as the review organ and as the
supervisor of top-management performance.</p>
<p>But the enterprise also needs a board that is, in effect, an organ of
information, advice, consultation, and communication—that is, the public
and community relations board. If the enterprise and its top management
do not create this board, it will be imposed on them in wrong and
harmful form, that is, as an organ of antagonism, control, and
restraint— which is what worker representation on the German board,
government representation on the Swedish board, and minority-group
representation on the American board are. That this will further
undermine the board may be a minor matter. It will, however, also un-
dermine the authority of company and top management, impair their
integrity, and reduce their capacity to perform.</p>
<p>What Is Needed</p>
<p>Clearly, two different organs are needed. One is the executive board
which gives top management somebody to talk to, a review organ, a
conscience, a counselor, an advisor— but also an informed and prepared
“stand-by” in case there is “power failure,” that is, failure of a
company’s top management or need to find successors to today’s top man-
agement.</p>
<p>The other organ is the public and community relations board which
gives a company, and especially a large one, access to its various
publics.</p>
<p>There is no reason why these two could not legally be one body. But
they have to op- erate differently. With its public and community
relations board, top management needs to discuss what the various
publics want, need to know, and need to understand. With its executive
board top management needs to discuss what top management itself needs
to discuss, what top management itself needs to think through, needs to
decide, needs to understand. One way to satisfy the need for two boards
is to have the executive board operate as a special committee—an
executive committee—of a big board.</p>
<p>There are effective boards in existence. None so far fulfills
adequately all three of the board’s functions. Even so, however, they
demonstrate the importance of an effective board and the contribution it
can make.</p>
<p>One example is the small but exceedingly effective boards of the
Wallenberg Compa- nies, affiliated with Stockholm’s Enskilda Bank in
Sweden. Marcus Wallenberg, who led the Enskilda Bank in the period after
World War II, insisted on clear definition of top management’s place and
functions in the companies in which the bank played a leading role. This
then enabled him to build strong boards, which made a major contribution
to the affairs of each company. The tremendous economic growth of
Sweden—and espe- cially of the Wallenberg Companies—in the post-World
War II period, is in no small measure the result of Wallenberg’s
insistence on an effective board based on a clear defi- nition of the
top-management job.</p>
<p>Another example is the rise of Merck andandandand Company, a small
and fairly obscure drug house before World War II, to leadership in the
American pharmaceutical industry. In large part this was brought about
by one member of the board of directors, Vannevar Bush. Bush, who had
been a distinguished scientist at M.I.T. and then chief scientific ad-
ministrator in America’s World War II effort, joined the Merck board as
a part-time chairman with the specific assignment to think through what
the top management of the company should be and should do. One of his
conclusions was the need for an effective board which could both review
and guide top management, and could create access for it to major
publics such as the scientific community. And this, in turn, led to a
long-range strategy for Merck which, within a decade, gave a company
that had started far behind the old pros in its industry worldwide
leadership in an extremely competitive industry.</p>
<p>What is needed for an effective board is first careful thinking
through of the top- management function and of the function and work of
the board. It requires objectives and a work plan for the board. Unless
the board is set up to discharge specific functions with clear
objectives, it will not perform.</p>
<p>Who Belongs on a Board?</p>
<p>This requires thinking through who belongs on the board. Some of the
people who today are being put on boards—e.g., the company’s bankers and
underwriters—belong on the public and community relations board. The
financial community is a constituent. Man- agement needs to have access
to it, be understood by it, and understand it. But very few other people
who today sit on boards should be considered eligible for membership on
either the public and community relations board or the review and
appeals board.</p>
<p>Neither, for instance, should contain former company officers who
have retired. It will be argued that to exclude former senior managers
from board membership is to deprive the company of a great deal of
knowledge and wisdom. But the right way to keep avail- able to a
management the knowledge and wisdom of one of its retired elder
statesmen is the Japanese practice of retaining such a man as a
“counselor.” Similarly, no one who sells anything to the company,
whether goods or services, such as suppliers, lawyers, or consultants,
should be a member of the board.</p>
<p>Who, then, should be a board member? So far we can answer this
question only for membership on the review and appeals board.</p>
<p>The first requirement, is competence. Board members should have
proven their ability as senior executives—whether in a business, in
government service, or in other institu- tions. Ideally, the board
member of the future will be in his (or her) mid-fifties and willing to
step out of operating to become an advisor, a guide, a conscience.</p>
<p>Second, board members should have time for the job. In fact, no one
can really do the job well if he sits on more than a small number of
boards—maybe four or five at the most.</p>
<p>Georg Siemens, a century ago, knew this. He limited himself to a few
boards and promptly stepped down when he considered that he had
accomplished the mission for which he had originally joined a board. His
successors, however, forgot this—one of the more recent chief executives
of Deutsche Bank sat on well above a hundred boards. No</p>
<p>matter how brilliant and how well supported by a secretariat, no man
can possibly do his homework sitting on more than four or five
boards.</p>
<p>This then clearly means that the effective board member has to be a
“professional di- rector.” Indeed, board membership should be recognized
as a full-time profession for a really first rate man. And it should be
paid as such, i.e., by a fee and not by stock options or a share in the
profits.</p>
<p>Finally, board members should be independent of management. This
probably implies election for a limited period of years after which a
man would not be eligible for re- election. If a man knows that he will
not be re-elected after five years, no matter how well he gets along
with the management whom he serves as a board member, he is unlikely to
find it necessary to be subservient. At the same time, board members
should be elected for definite periods and should have reasonable
security of tenure during that period.</p>
<p>How to build the communications and community relations board we do
not yet know.</p>
<p>But it is just as urgent. Politically—as witness the German, Swedish,
American, and “Euroboard” developments—it may be more urgent. Surely the
traditional attitude of management, i.e., to resist any development that
would introduce the public and commu- nity relations function into the
board can no longer be maintained. However, justified it may have been,
it will not work any longer.</p>
<p>The choice is no longer between having a non-board, which is what we
are having to- day, by and large, and an effective board. It is between
a board imposed on enterprise and both hostile and inappropriate to it
and a board that is an effective organ of the enterprise and appropriate
to its needs.</p>
<h4 id="on-being-the-right-size">53 On Being the Right Size*</h4>
<p>The Law of Surface and Mass—Size and Complexity—Why Changes in Size
are “Quantum Jumps” —Size and Strategy—Size and Complexity as
Top-Management Tasks</p>
<p>he surface diameter’s</p>
<p>of any object increases with the square of its diameter, the mass
with the cube. As the diameter goes from 2 to 3 to 4, the mass goes from
8 to 27 to</p>
<p>64, while the surface increases only from 4 to 9 to 16.</p>
<p>This elementary law of geometry is of profound importance to
management. It means that size, structure, and strategy are closely
related. Different sizes require different struc- tures, different
policies, different strategies, and different behaviors. There are right
sizes and wrong sizes for different businesses. The law implies that
there is a finite limit to size beyond which an organization declines in
productivity and ultimately ceases to be man- ageable. It finally
implies that changes in size are not continuous but that, at a point in
growth, there has to be an “evolutionary leap,” a genuine
transformation.</p>
<p>For biological organisms, the implications of the law of surface and
mass were worked out by a British biologist.† Thompson proved that
beyond a point in size—and a fairly early one at that—the hardened skin
of the insect can no longer support the mass. A skele- ton is required.
Thompson also proved that there are finite limits to size. If the
elephant were to grow much larger, legs sturdy enough to support the
animal’s weight would be too massive to be lifted.</p>
<p>Social organisms may be far too complex to allow neat quantitative
formulae for their sizes.‡ But in a social organism, too, “mass” always
increases much faster than “surface.” “Weight,” too, therefore goes up
faster than the supporting structure. As a result, changes in size are
not merely quantitative. They are changes in quality. There are, as a
result, “right” and “wrong” sizes; that is, sizes which require a
structure that is appropriate to performance and function, and sizes in
which the structure needed to support the mass is inadequate or
inappropriate and becomes an impediment. And there is a finite limit to
size. There are organizations that are simply too big to function (as
Gallant and Prothero tried to demonstrate for the giant university).</p>
<p>The law of surface and mass implies an inescapable relationship
between size and complexity. The bigger the organism grows, the further
away will be the bulk of its mass from the outside environment. The more
will it therefore need specialized and complex</p>
<p>*With apologies to J.B.S. Haldane, whose 1928 essay of the same title
on biological organisms remains the most perceptive discussion of the
relationship between size, function, and structure.</p>
<p>†D’Arcy Thompson, On Growth and Form (Cambridge, 1917).</p>
<p>‡The first attempt to work out a “law of size” for social structures
is an article, “Weight Watching at the Uni- versity: The Consequence of
Growth,” by J. A. Gallant and J. W. Prothero (Science, Vol. 175, No:
4020, Janu- ary 28, 1972). The authors concluded that a university
becomes too large to educate students and to be man- ageable once it
grows beyond 15,000 to 20,000 students in enrollment.</p>
<p>organs to supply it with the essentials of life. Again, there is a
finite limit to complexity. Beyond a certain point the complexity
becomes more than structure, no matter how de- signed, can support.</p>
<p>The human body, for instance, has reached the limit of its evolution
with respect to brain size. Were the brain to become bigger or more
complex, the oxygen supply needed to sustain it would require such high
blood pressure as to kill man in order to keep him alive.</p>
<p>In social organization, such as a business, growth in size soon
requires disproportion- ate increase in complexity and more and more
specialized organs. Soon organs have to be developed that take care of
the “inside,” that is, organs that inform and direct the increas- ing
mass and “feed back” to it from the increasingly remote outside the
results of its own “inside” activities. The larger any body, physical or
social, becomes, the more of its en- ergy will be needed to keep the
“inside” that is, its own mechanisms, alive and function- ing. Again,
mere quantity soon becomes a change in qual.ity.</p>
<p>The reciprocal relationship also holds. The more complex the
organization, the more does it have to be organized on the structural
principle of larger size. Size determines complexity. But complexity, in
turn, determines size. The law of surface and mass implies that change
from one kind of size to another, or from one kind of complexity to
another, is not continuous. It is a “threshold” phenomenon. There is a
point at which a transforma- tion has to take place.</p>
<p>The skeleton of the higher animals did not evolve out of the insect’s
hard skin. And the early hominoids, our remote ancestors, had to develop
a brain a good deal larger than their own needs required before they
could make the next evolutionary step to walking upright, to making
tools, or to using fire.</p>
<p>Beyond a point in size or complexity quantity demands a “quantum
jump,” a trans- formation in quality rather than a mere addition.</p>
<p>This is what Henry Ford failed to understand when he believed that he
could continue to run his company without management and managers
despite its giant size. For man- agement is an “evolutionary leap.” It
did not evolve from the single proprietor any more than the skeleton
evolved from the insect’s hard skin.</p>
<p>This is what people usually do not understand when they talk of
“delegation,” that is, when they imply that managers do their job as
part of the job of top management or as part of the job of the board of
directors. “Delegation” always implies that the delegator can take back
the delegated task. But the cells of the higher animals cannot take back
the function of the brain. It is not delegated, but is an autonomous
function of its own.</p>
<p>Similarly, every managerial job, if properly designed, is not
delegated but is a function of its own with its own authority. It is the
result of an evolutionary leap rather than an extension of what is
already being done.</p>
<p>Size and Strategy</p>
<p>Size by itself has major impact on strategy. And strategy, in turn,
has major impact on size. The small organization can do things the large
ones cannot do. Its simplicity and its small size should give it fast
response, agility, and the ability to focus its resources. But the large
organization, in turn, also can do things the small organization cannot
do. It can commit resources for a much longer time, for instance, to
long-term research projects which are beyond the staying power of the
small business. The question “What strategies befit different sizes?” is
thus of crucial importance to top management.</p>
<p>But, in turn, different strategies also require different sizes. A
business that aims at a leadership position in a major, let alone a
worldwide, market, clearly has to be a large business. But even in a big
market, a business which aims at filling a special and limited niche
better remain small.</p>
<p>One example of such a business would be Rolls-Royce, which in one of
the world’s largest markets, the automobile market, has carved out for
itself a small but exceedingly</p>
<p>profitable niche where it is practically without competition, but
where it also cannot grow beyond modest size.*</p>
<p>The relationship between size and strategy is further complicated by
the fact that the “big” business may actually be a confederation of
fair-sized or even of small businesses, each with its own strategies and
its own markets. Then the business needs to think through in effect two
strategies, a number of “small-business strategies” for each of its
constituent units, and a “big business strategy” for the business
overall. Complexity then becomes a major factor.</p>
<p>The individual employee, whether rank-and-file or managerial, is not
primarily af- fected by the questions of size and complexity. The worker
on the machine, the key-punch operator, the billing clerk, the
heat-treating specialist, or the plant manager do the same job whether
the company is small or huge, simple or complex. Size and complexity be-
come problems, first, in the upper reaches of middle management and
especially for sen- ior professionals. They affect their world, yet
they, in turn, have little impact on, and prac- tically no
responsibility for, the decisions on size and complexity.</p>
<p>Size and complexity are above all top-management problems and require
top- management decisions.</p>
<p>Public-service institutions also stand under the laws of size and
complexity. For them too (as mentioned earlier with respect to the
university) there is a right size and a wrong size. This also applies to
“service staff” within a business. That a “conscience activity” requires
small size, and preferably a one-man staff; was argued earlier (Chapter
42). A staff that is supposed to teach and to innovate in a functional
area—marketing, for in- stance, or the management of people—had better
be small, otherwise its internal complex- ity will force its ablest
people to become “administrators” instead of being teachers and
innovators. And in a staff service within an organization, size and
structure should always be adjusted to fit the needs of the desired
strategy and to serve the objectives of the work. In a staff service,
above all, size and complexity must be managed—or strategy and ob-
jectives suffer.</p>
<p>Top management needs to know, first, what size its company is. Top
management needs to know what size its business should be. It needs to
know whether its business is the right size or the wrong size. It needs
to know whether the structure is appropriate to the company’s size and
complexity. It needs to know what top management’s own job is in
companies of different sizes and complexities.</p>
<p>And it needs to relate size and complexity to company strategy. It
might have to de- cide that the company, as it now stands, is not
capable of carrying out its strategy. It may even have to decide that
the company, as it now stands, is not viable because it is of an
incurably wrong size. And top management needs to know what follows from
such find- ings and what alternatives of strategy and behavior are
available to the company. For, unlike biological organisms, a social
organization such as a business does not have a size entirely determined
by forces over which it has no control.</p>
<p>There are minimum sizes below which a business in a given industry or
market is sim- ply not viable. There are maximum sizes beyond which a
business, no matter how well managed, will not, in the long run,
prosper. But in between—and the range is very wide indeed—size and
complexity have to be considered as “business objectives.” Like all
other objectives they are not “under the control” of management in the
sense that what is desirable is also, therefore, attainable, let alone
already achieved. Like all other business objectives, attaining the
right size requires hard thinking and serious, consistent work.</p>
<p>*This refers, of course, only to the Rolls-Royce automobile business.
The Rolls-Royce aircraft business, which caused the company’s bankruptcy
in 1971, is, however, also an example of the relationship between size
and strategy. For here, Rolls-Royce suffered from being far too small in
size and resources for the leadership role it aimed at in the world’s
jet-engine business. In the aircraft-engine market Rolls-Royce was the
“wrong size.”</p>
<p>Specifically, there are five major areas to be considered:</p>
<p>1 Managing smallness and bigness—that is, the management requirements
of size by itself. “How big is big?” “What are ‘right’ sizes and what
are ‘wrong’ sizes?” “What are the limits beyond which further growth is
degenerative?” And, “What are the implications of size for business
strategy?”</p>
<p>2 The second major area is the management of complexity and
diversity. “How complex is complex?” “How complex is too complex?” And,
“What re- quirements does complexity make?”</p>
<p>A separate problem in complexity that deserves some discussion is
that of the limits on the family-owned business. “Can it perpetuate
itself?” “Can it grow beyond small size?” And, “What are its limits in
time and size?”</p>
<p>3 A special case of complexity, so important as to deserve a separate
chapter, is the most complex of business organizations, the
multinational corporation. For here is added to complexities of size,
markets, products, and technolo- gies, the complexities of cultures and
the complexities of multiple political and governmental relationships
and restraints.</p>
<p>4 Managing change and growth is the next major topic. “At what point
in change and growth does management have to change its characteristics,
its structure, its behavior?” And, “How can it prepare itself so that it
is ready for change and for growth without, at the same time,
overloading the company with functions and complexities which, at the
present state of the business, it does not require and can ill
afford?”</p>
<p>5 Managing innovation is a topic in itself. “Man is the only animal
capable of purposeful evolution; he makes tools.” This insight of Alfred
Russel Wallace, co-discoverer with Darwin of the principle of evolution,
means that man and his social organizations can innovate. They can
create, so to speak, a differ- ent animal. Indeed, in a changing
environment their survival depends on their capacity to innovate. What
does an innovative organization have to be and how does it have to be
structured and managed?</p>
<p>It is with these topics that the next chapters will, concern
themselves.</p>

<p>How Big Is Big?</p>
<p>othing knows</p>
<p>would seem simpler than to know how big a business is. Everybody,
after all, that the corner grocery store is “small” and that the General
Electric Com-</p>
<p>pany or the Deutsche Bank is “big.” But things are by no means so
simple.</p>
<p>In 1966, the Small Business Administration, an agency of the U.S.
Government, ruled that the American Motors Company was a small business
and therefore entitled to borrow on special and highly advantageous
terms. At that time, American Motors was sixty-third in size among all
American manufacturing companies and was among the world’s one hundred
largest .manufacturing companies. It had sales of a billion dollars and
about 30,000 employees. Yet the government ruling was not entirely
irrational. In the American automobile industry, American Motors was
indeed a midget. Its sales were no more than one-twentieth of that of
the industry’s leader, General Motors. Even Chrysler, next to American
Motors smallest U.S. auto maker, had seven times the sales of American
Mo- tors. With no more than 3 or 4 percent of the American automobile
market, American Motors was so small as to be in danger of collapse.</p>
<p>American Motors was, of course, not a small business at the time, nor
is it today. It was something quite different—a big business that is the
wrong size. Yet the example shows that size is not mere quantity and
that indeed it is far from obvious in many cases what size a business
really is.</p>
<p>The traditional measurement of business size is the number of
employees. For many years the U.S. Department of Commerce in its
industry analyses defined a small business as one that has fewer than a
certain number of employees—originally around 300 to 500. The number of
employees is important. Once the number of employees goes beyond 1,000,
for instance, systematic personnel administration becomes necessary. A
business employing over 1,000 people requires policies and procedures
which are not normally</p>
<p>considered as pertaining to a small business. Yet there are
businesses that are very modest in total employment and yet are quite
clearly fair-sized, if not big businesses. And there are businesses that
are quite small in their basic management requirements and yet have many
more than 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>A management consulting firm with 300 or 400 professional consultants
working out of a dozen offices is, in terms of employees, a small
business. In terms of its management requirements, it is a very big
business indeed. A worldwide accounting firm, such as Price Waterhouse,
with 4,000 or 5,000 professional employees working in thirty
countries—or one of the multinational advertising agencies which grew so
rapidly during the 1960s—is actually a giant business. It may well be
at, if not beyond the limit of manageability, even though in terms of
employees it is medium-sized.</p>
<p>But there are also such examples as a multinational manufacturing
company, head- quartered in one of the small European countries which
manufactures and sells highly engineered precision equipment for the
heavy apparatus and machinery industry. The en- tire company has only
1,800 employees working in about ten countries, with no office or plant
having more than 300 or 400 people. Manufacturing employment is almost
minus- cule—a total of 400 men in five plants. The rest are design
engineers, service engineers, metallurgists, and so on. This company,
despite its small employment, is a fairly big busi- ness and has to be
run as such; it is complex beyond its size.</p>
<p>In contrast, there are businesses employing a great many people which
are essentially small or, at best, fair-sized companies.</p>
<p>One example is a highly specialized American company which, in a
major region of the country, has leadership position in one branch of
insurance. There are 4,000 or 5,000 people on the payroll, most of them
salesmen and claims adjusters. In its basic character- istics, however,
this is still a fairly small business. There are no more than two levels
of management, the management at the headquarters of the company, and
the general man- agers of each of the fourteen districts. The “feel” of
the company is clearly “small busi- ness.”</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce, in its automotive business, is also a small business
turning out a few thousand cars a year, with a handful of major
distributors throughout the world and with a management structure of the
utmost simplicity.</p>
<p>No other yardstick does any better than employment as a measurement
of size. Sales, for instance, while used widely, is quite misleading. A
chemical company with 0 mil- lion of sales may be a fairly big business.
A metalworking company with the same sales volume may be actually so
small as to be hardly viable.</p>
<p>Most of the sales volume of the typical chemical company is “value
added.” But the typical metalworking company tends to be an assembler
rather than a manufacturer. Two- thirds or more of its sales volume may
actually be represented by parts and supplies which it buys from
others.</p>
<p>Businesses may be very much larger and rank high in terms of sales
and yet be small or, at best, fair-sized.</p>
<p>American Home Products Company, in the 1950s, was already, in terms
of its sales, a very large company, selling then about a half a billion
dollars’ worth of goods a year. Yet the company’s top management
consisted of four men who worked practically without staff: a chairman,
a president, a financial vice-president, and a personnel vice-president.
The company had six to eight divisions, each a sizable business in its
own field, but all engaged in the same basic business, the
manufacturing, promotion, and distribution of branded products through
retail stores. It could be run as a simple, and indeed almost as a
small, business, and was run successfully in that fashion.</p>
<p>Another similar example—also from the 1950s—was the automotive
business of A.</p>
<p>O. Smith in Milwaukee, the leading supplier of passenger-car frames
to the American automobile industry. Sales of this business, then the
main division of the company, were around 00 million, with employment
well above 20,000. Yet in its “feel,” but also in its strategy and
structure, this was a fair-sized business. It required excellence in
cost control, in manufacturing, and in scheduling deliveries to the
customers and their many plants</p>
<p>scattered around the country. But, being a single-product business
with one technology, one market, and with only a handful of customers,
the business could be managed by one chief executive with all the rest
of his people functional managers or specialists. It re- quired neither
elaborate controls nor central staffs, nor any of the appurtenances of
big- ness.</p>
<p>Even for companies in the same industry sales figures are not always
a reliable indica- tor of size. One of the large American rubber
companies, for instance, used to sell the bulk of its output through its
own wholly owned retail stores. The sales figure, therefore, was based
on the retail value of its products, and especially of automobile tires.
Another leading American rubber company, however, sold practically
nothing directly to the pub- lic. It either sold tires to the automobile
companies as original equipment for new cars, or it sold tires under
“private labels” to the large petroleurn companies for distribution
through their service stations. Its sales volume, therefore, represented
manufacturer’s value, which in the rubber industry is a good deal less
than half of what the final con- sumer pays. According to its sales
figures, the second company was much smaller than the first company,
whereas in actual output, but also in return on investment, it was by
far the larger business.</p>
<p>But even “value added” is not an adequate measurement. For it can be
applied only to manufacturing companies. “Value added” is a meaningless
concept for a retail business, for a bank, for a life insurance company,
and for any other business which is not primarily engaged in
manufacturing.</p>
<p>In sum: size is a configuration rather than a single aspect of a
business. To determine whether a company is small or big, one needs to
look at a number of factors: employment, sales, value added (where
applicable), the complexity and diversity of its product range, the
number of markets it is engaged in, the complexity of its technology,
and so on. But one also has to look at the structure of the industry in
which it operates, and at its share of its markets, and a number of
other factors, none of them by itself decisive.</p>
<p>The one true expression of this configuration which is size is
management and man- agement structure. A small business is a business
which requires at most one man who does nothing but top-management work
and who is not engaged in any of the functional work required.</p>
<p>This, however, tells us what ought to be, rather than what is. A
business is not neces- sarily small because the entire top-management
task is vested in one man. It may very well be a big business that is
structured the wrong way; Henry Ford’s company was one example. In turn,
a business that has a big top-management structure may still be a small
business in which the top-management job has been misorganized. Examples
abound.</p>
<p>There is only one criterion which, with fair reliability, indicates
whether a business is small, fair-sized, or big. In a genuinely small
business, the man at the top knows who the few people are in the
organization in whom responsibility for key results rests without having
to consult the records or any of his associates. He knows what their
assignments are. He knows their backgrounds, their previous assignments,
and how well they have performed in them. He knows what they can do. He
also knows their limitations—or at least he thinks he does. And he
knows, as a rule, what their next assignment is likely to be. This, of
course, means that the key group is a small one. Regardless of title and
posi- tion, it can hardly exceed twelve to fifteen men, which is about
the largest number one man can really know and can really be familiar
with.</p>
<p>In a fair-sized business—the next and in some ways the most important
category of business—the one man at the top can no longer by himself
identify and really know every one of the truly important men in the
organization. This requires a group of three or four men together.
Typically, in the fair-sized organization, the top man, when asked to
name his key people, will bring in a few of his closest associates and
will answer the question with them collectively rather than
individually. In a fair-sized organization the number of key people who
are known to be crucial to the performance and results of the
organization may run to forty or fifty.</p>
<p>Any business in which even a small group at the top no longer knows,
without consul- tation with others or without consulting charts or
records, who the crucial people are, where they are, where they have
come from, what they are doing, and where they are likely to go, is a
big business.</p>
<p>It is this test which shows that the management consulting firm with
300 or 400 pro- fessionals on its staff is a big business. It is this
test which shows that American Home Products in the 1950s was a
fair-sized company despite its 00 million of sales. And it is this test
which also shows that the multinational precision-engineering company
men- tioned above, despite its very small employment, is close to being
a big business and has to be run as such.</p>
<p>This test is neither infallible nor precise. But it focuses on the
one and only genuine characteristic of size: the management structure it
requires.</p>
<p>Managing the Small Business</p>
<p>For a hundred years we have been told by eminent authorities that
small business is being gobbled up by the “giants” and is about to
disappear. For a hundred years this has proven to be nonsense. The small
business is doing just as well as it did a hundred years ago. The
figures show clearly that proportionately neither the importance nor the
number of small businesses—but also of big businesses—has changed very
much since 1900, despite al1 the dire prophecies of monopoly, and all
the fears of “undue concentration of economic power.”</p>
<p>Small business and big business are not alternatives. They are
complements. The big business depends on small and medium-sized
businesses, who in turn depend on a big business. (This seems to be just
as true in communist economies in which all businesses are owned and
managed by the government as it is in free-enterprise economies.) Typi-
cally, there is, for instance, a big manufacturer, say, an automobile
company such as Gen- eral Motors, Volkswagen, or Toyota. But this
company depends on a host of suppliers and subcontractors who are mostly
small or fair-sized. It depends on a host of dealers, who again are
small or fair-sized. The large retailers such as Sears, Roebuck, Marks
andandandand Spencer, and the department store chains in Japan, depend
on a host of small manufactur- ers, who in turn depend on the big stores
for access to the market. There is no economic chain in a modern economy
that is composed entirely of big businesses, but also no eco- nomic
chain that is composed entirely of small businesses. Businesses of
different sizes are interdependent, with the small ones often requiring
a large one, and the large one in turn dependent on small ones.</p>
<p>What the Small Business Needs</p>
<p>Not so long ago it was widely believed that the small business needed
little or no attention to management. Management was then thought to be
for the “big boys.” One still hears people in a small business saying,
“Management? That’s for General Electric; we are small and simple enough
to do without attention to management.” But this is delusion. The small
business needs organized and systematic management even more than the
big business. It does not need, to be sure, large central staffs. It
does not need elaborate pro- cedures and techniques in many areas. In
fact, it can afford neither large staffs nor elabo- rate procedures. But
it does need management of a high order.</p>
<p>In the first place, it needs strategy. The small business cannot
afford to become mar- ginal. Yet this is its perennial danger. It must
therefore think through a strategy which gives it distinction. It must,
to speak in biological terms, find its specific ecological niche in
which it has an advantage and can therefore withstand competition. This
specific niche may be leadership in a distinct market, whether it is
defined by geography, consumer needs, or consumer values. The strategy
may lie in a specific excellence, such as a capac- ity to give service.
Or it may lie in a specific technology.</p>
<p>An example of such an ecological niche is a small pharmaceutical
company in the United States which has more than held its own in an
industry led by multinational giants.</p>
<p>By concentrating on the need of the opthalmologist in the treatment
of his patients, and especially on the needs of the ophthalmologic
surgeon, the company has carved out an ecological niche an which, while
not without competition, it has established strong leader- ship.</p>
<p>And there is also the Checker Cab Company, which does nothing but
manufacture taxicabs for major American cities. Checker produces only
4,000 cars a year. But while American Motors with eighty times that
volume is marginal, Checker Cab is a leader.</p>
<p>The strategy of a small business may also focus on excellence in a
small but vital area of service. In a period in which the large
supermarket chains in the United States did, by and large, rather
poorly, a small number of regional chains, some in the East and some on
the West Coast, showed extraordinary results. In every case this rested
on a decision on the part of their managers to concentrate and to build
excellence in one area. Typically, one of them decided that in the vast
array of processed branded foods, it could not offer anything the giants
could not do just as well. But it could offer what the giants, by virtue
of their size, would find very difficult to offer: really first-rate
meat and truly courteous service. And these are exactly what supermarket
customers value the most.</p>
<p>But businesses that are even smaller also need a strategy and can
develop one.</p>
<p>The suburban areas surrounding the major cities of the United States
are, as a rule, oversupplied with real estate agents, most of whom just
eke out a living. But in one area, one real estate agent has developed a
small but exceedingly profitable business by think- ing through a
strategy for leadership. When he first started out around 1950, this man
took a close look at his area and found that its leading “industry” was
higher education. While many of the residents commuted into the big city
nearby, a sizable and affluent group consisted of the teachers in
twenty-odd universities and colleges, most of them small, but a few
quite large. Of all occupational groups in the United States, young
college faculty may have the highest turnover. Typically, the young
college professor takes a job for a few years, after which he moves to
another institution elsewhere. In total, the twenty col- leges and
universities in the area hire each year more than five hundred new
people, while an equal number leave. The young real estate man decided
to concentrate on this market and developed for it the services it
needs. He also realized that he could get direct access to his market
with a minimum of cost. For, of course, the names of all the new
teachers hired as well as the names of those who will be leaving at the
end of the academic year are known to the colleges many months before
they actually move. And each college is only too happy to hand over the
difficult and irritating job of finding housing for new faculty to a
reliable man. As a result this real estate agent does almost three times
the business that an office of his size usually handles and with a
minimum of expense. His total volume, about 500 to 1,000 houses a year,
is still modest, but his net profit is almost four times that of the
typical suburban realtor.</p>
<p>These, to be sure, are highly atypical examples. For the typical
small business has no strategy. The typical small business is not
“opportunistic,” it is “problematical”—it lives from problem to problem.
But the typical small business is also, as a result, not a success- ful
business. The first requirement in managing a small business is
therefore to ask and answer the question “What is our business—and what
should it be?”</p>
<p>The second requirement is that small business organize and structure
the top- management tasks. A small business is defined as a business
which requires at most one full-time top manager who does nothing else.
In fact, in most small businesses, the top man also carries some
functional responsibility and usually should do so. But this makes it
all the more necessary for the small business to identify the key
activities which are needed to attain the objectives of the business and
to make sure that they are being as- signed to somebody who is
accountable. Otherwise key activities will not be done at all.</p>
<p>Most small businesses think that they know what the key activities
are. Most small businesses also believe that they take care of the key
activities. But even superficial analysis usually reveals that they
deceive themselves. Everybody may talk about the key activities but
nobody pays much attention to them. They are seen but not perceived—and
as a result usually neglected. The need is rarely for more staff. The
need is for a little</p>
<p>thought, a little organization, and a simple reporting and control
system—no more than a checklist, perhaps—to make sure that the work is
actually being done.</p>
<p>This also means, in effect, that even a small business needs a
top-management team.</p>
<p>Most of its members will be engaged on top-management tasks
part-time. Their primary duties are likely to be functional. But the
small business, as much as any other—and per- haps more than most—needs
to make sure that its entire management group knows what the key
activities are, what the goals in each are, and who is responsible for
getting the work done.</p>
<p>Everybody in a small and highly specialized business supplying
lawn-care products, such as grass seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, to
the suburban homeowner, “knew” what the key activities were:
manufacturing and selling, obviously. But the first time that someone
asked the question, it turned out that the key activities were
different—they were research on how the consumer in the American suburb
looks at the lawn, and does the work on the lawn. It was research on
what the consumer expects and considers value. It was promotion both to
the dealer and to the consumer. It was packaging to make it possi- ble
for dealers to move the company’s products without having to “sell”
them, and so on. Nobody was surprised—in fact, it was all “obvious.” But
nobody up to that time had ac- tually taken the trouble to put down the
obvious. As a result, no one was responsible for any of the key
activities. It took little time to identify the key activities and not
much more time to make sure that each was lodged in the existing
structure and made the responsibil- ity of someone already in
management. The company itself credits its rapid growth and success, in
the years since, to its identifying the key activities and building them
into the management structure.</p>
<p>The small business has limited resources, above all, of good men.
Concentration is therefore essential to it. And unless the key
activities are clearly identified and assigned as responsibilities,
there will be diffusion of resources rather than concentration.</p>
<p>The small business needs to pay special attention to making the top
man effective.</p>
<p>Even if he is free from functional work and can devote all his time
to the top-management tasks, the load on him is likely to be heavy. He
is certain to be under relentless pressure from all kinds of
demands—from major customers and from employees; from suppliers and from
banks. Unless he takes responsibility for his own job, his energies will
not be used properly.</p>
<p>The first questions to ask are “What is the top man really good at?”
“What is it that he can do better than anybody else in the business?”
And, “What, among the things he is really good at, are crucial and are
essential to the survival and success of the business?” In the
top-management team, the specific job assignment to any one member
should, as has been said before (Chapter 50) reflect personality. The
small business needs to ask: “Which of the key activities are the ones
the top man himself should take?” Analysis of the key activities should
be impersonal and objective; but assignments, and especially the
assignment of that part which the top man himself handles, has to be
based on what the individual excels in.</p>
<p>In many small, and especially in small and growing, businesses, the
top man is criti- cized by his associates for spending his time on the
wrong things. If by that they mean that the key activities of the
business are not being taken care of, their criticism is well taken. But
often they mean that he is using his strengths and tackling the
activities he is particularly good at, whereas other and equally
important key activities are not being done by him. Then the answer is
not to talk a man who, for instance, is not very good at han- dling
people but excellent at finance into letting the controller do the
finance work, while he himself takes on the management of people. The
answer is to recognize that a top man gifted in the financial area is a
major asset. But then, somebody else better take over the people
responsibility which is a key activity and has to be discharged.</p>
<p>The top man in a small business has to structure his job so as to
have time for two tasks which nobody else can carry. He has to have time
for the key people in the com- pany. And, he has to have time for the
“outside,” that is, for the market, the customer, the technologies. He
has to make sure that he does not become desk-bound.</p>
<p>A major strength of small business is the ability of the man at the
top to know every one of the key people, their ambitions, their
aspirations, their way of thought and action, their strengths and their
limitations, their performance record, and their potential. This
requires time. Above all, it requires unstructured time; that is, time
without a specific agenda, time not spent on a “problem.”</p>
<p>The same goes for the time needed for the outside. A small business
needs a strategy for leadership in a small but defined area. This
requires intimate acquaintance with the outside. If the business aims at
leadership in supplying taxicabs, as the Checker Cab Company does, it
requires time to spend with the licensing authorities of the major
cities whose specifications create the market for the company. It
requires time with the owners of taxi fleets. It perhaps even requires
time with taxicab drivers and passengers.</p>
<p>Most top men in small businesses will protest that they already spend
too much time outside the office. They are forever on the road. They
themselves often handle the big accounts, for instance. They usually
have to negotiate whatever loans they need from the bank. But they need
outside time of a different kind. They need time to keep themselves
informed on their market, on new opportunities, on changes that affect
the business. They need time to be able to answer the question “And what
should our business be?” Again, this does not require many hours. But it
does require systematic, purposeful work that is different in character
from the daily operating routine.</p>
<p>Finally, the small business needs its own control and information
system. Its resources are limited, in both men and money. It has to make
sure that its resources are deployed where they bring in results. Its
ability to get additional resources is equally limited. It therefore
needs to make sure that it will not outrun its financial base. It needs
to know well in advance when and where its financial needs will
increase. The small business can- not afford to find itself in a
liquidity squeeze and with a sudden demand for more money. Even if the
business prospers, it takes time, as a rule, to provide additional
financing.</p>
<p>The small business also needs to know major changes in its
environment. It depends for its success on its preferred position in a
small ecological niche. It therefore needs to know any possibility of
changes in this niche.</p>
<p>The usual accounting information, while needed, is not enough. The
small business needs to know where each of its key people is positioned
and whether he is assigned to “results” or to “problems.” It needs to
know the productivity of its scarce resources—the productivity of
people; the productivity of capital; and the productivity of raw
materials and supplies. It needs to know how its business is distributed
among its customers: does it for instance, depend for its business on
two or three large customers with the rest of its business splintered
among many hundred small ones? And to what extent is it therefore
vulnerable?</p>
<p>Special mention should be given here to the financial and economic
information the small business needs and usually does not have. To be
sure, small businesses today are likely to have the conventional
accounting figures. Few, however, know their cash flow, and even fewer
are in a position to forecast tomorrow’s cash needs. They all know, or
should know, their receivables. But they do not, as a rule, know whether
their customers, their distributors and dealers, are building up their
inventories of the company’s products. They need, therefore, a little
information about the ultimate market for their goods, that is, consumer
purchases from dealers.</p>
<p>Again, a small business needs very few figures. And most of the
figures it needs are easy to obtain, especially as precision is rarely
needed. But the figures the small business needs the most to be managed
are not, as a rule, figures the ordinary accounting model provides. They
are figures which relate the present condition of the company and the
pre- sent deployment of its key resources to anticipated future
developments, both to identify opportunities and to ward off danger.</p>
<p>The small business cannot afford “big management,” if by that is
meant an abundance of staff, of procedures, and of figures. But it needs
first-rate management. It needs to structure the top-management job
precisely because it cannot afford an elaborate top- management
structure.</p>
<p>The Fair-Sized Business</p>
<p>In many respects the fair-sized business is the ideal business. It
should enjoy the advan- tages both of being small and of being big.
People still know each other and can easily get together. Teamwork
organizes itself and should require no special effort. Everybody should
understand what his ,job is and what he is expected to contribute. At
the same time, resources are already adequate to support key activities
and to obtain excellence in those areas where excellence is required and
produces results. And the fair-sized business is big enough to obtain
whatever economies of scale there are. The fair-sized business is the
“middle class” in the Aristotelian sense: the position in business
society which is most secure, most enjoyable, and most productive.</p>
<p>The fair-sized business should also be the easiest business to
manage. In fact, obser- vance of the simple rules that make a small
business manageable should be enough. Yet the fair-sized business also
has its own challenges and its own problems. It needs its own management
rules.</p>
<p>There are actually three different types of fair-sized businesses.
One is exemplified by the automotive division of the A. O. Smith
Company, mentioned above, as it was in the 1950s: a fair-sized business
with a narrow product range, one technology, and one major market. This,
in many ways, is basically a small business but one with a larger key
per- sonnel group than any one man can really know.</p>
<p>The second type is also typified by an example already given: that of
the American Home Products Company of twenty years ago in which a
fair-sized—almost a big— business is composed of a number of autonomous
small businesses, each with its own product lines and its own markets,
but with the same basic economic characteristics. And then there is a
third fair-sized business in which there are separate businesses with
sepa- rate markets which, however, are mutually dependent on each
other.</p>
<p>The best example is a Japanese one. The privately owned electric
railroad—known as the Hankyu Line—which Ichizo Kobayashi built around
1910 to connect Osaka and Kobe was a small business. But then Kobayashi
started a real estate company which developed commuter suburbs along the
railroad’s right of way, both as a business in itself and to generate
traffic for the railroad. Then Hankyu started big restaurants in its two
main ter- minals. The next venture was popular theaters, especially the
famous Girls’ Opera at the terminus of one of the branch lines. A big
department store on top of the Osaka station came next, and finally
hotels. Each of these ventures was an independent, and highly suc-
cessful, business. And each fed off the business generated by the others
and provided cus- tomers for them. All exploited and, at the same time,
increased the company’s basic “franchise.”</p>
<p>This last category is perhaps the one line of business to which the
much-abused term “synergetic” should be applied. Each unit of such a
company is a true business. But the businesses are also interdependent
and comprise together one system, which is a business in its own right
and has to be managed and measured as such.</p>
<p>All three of these types are fair-sized by the yardstick given above.
In each of them, in other words, a small top-management group can and
does know, without consulting or- ganization charts and records, who the
key people in the business are, what their assign- ments are, where they
came from, what their strengths and limitations are, and where they are
likely to go. But otherwise, they have different problems.</p>
<p>The central problem of the fair-sized one-product or one-market
business, the A. O.</p>
<p>Smith type of business, is organization structure. Such a business
is, as a rule, already too large and too complex to be served adequately
by the traditional functional organization. The symptoms of
malorganization to look for in this kind of business are the symptoms of
overextended functionalism: poor communication; functional parochialism;
a long re- sponse time to new stimuli; the tendency to “solve problems”
rather than to make deci- sions; and the tendency to tackle business
challenges in terms of functional specialties rather than in terms of
the direction and performance of the entire business.</p>
<p>Yet such a business cannot be organized in terms of federal
decentralization. There are no autonomous profit and loss centers within
it. This business has to apply simulated decentralization to what are,
in effect, cost centers: e.g., manufacturing. Such a business also often
should use the task force team as a supplementary organizational
principle.</p>
<p>But top-management structure also is a problem in such a business.
For such a busi- ness requires a top-management team. Yet it is usually
organized in such a way that only one man is working full-time on the
top-management job. The fair-sized, one-product or one-market, business
will therefore have to build a top management in which a number of
people are exclusively, or at least primarily, engaged in top-management
work.</p>
<p>This is particularly true for what I call “conscience” work. The
fair-sized business needs to think through the areas in which it
requires excellence. In these areas—and only in them—it should, as a
rule, have a few, a very few men whose job it is to think, to plan, to
advise, and not to operate. Otherwise there is danger that the business
will lose its ex- cellence in key areas and will decline into
middle-aged mediocrity.</p>
<p>The federally organized fair-sized business is the easiest to
organize. It need not, as a rule, use any organization principles other
than the functional principles for the individual businesses and the
principle of federal decentralization for the overall company design.
Teams, to be sure, will be used. But they are not essential within the
individual units ex- cept for innovation.</p>
<p>But top management in such a business has to be based on the team
design, and on a fairly complex one. For such a business needs a number
of top-management teams. And its key people will have to play on several
of these teams at the same time. Such a busi- ness needs a small
corporate top management which does not engage in any work except
top-management work.</p>
<p>But each autonomous business unit also needs a top management. The
top manage- ment of the unit should be small. The man who heads each
unit is “top management” for it. But he needs to think through the key
activities of the unit and to lodge them within his own group. But at
the same time, the top-management team of his unit also includes the top
management of the company. At American Home Products, for example, each
of the four members of corporate top management was, at the same time, a
member of the top- management team of one or more of the operating
businesses.</p>
<p>For the areas which are “corporate,” such as what the business is and
what it should be; what new businesses to enter and what old ones to go
out of; the supply and allocation of capital; and the placement of key
people, corporate top management is the top- management team. It will,
of course, consult with the heads of the individual units. But the
decision has to be made in contemplation of the entire business.</p>
<p>For his individual unit, however, it is the general manager of the
unit rather than the chief executive officer of the corporation who is
the leader and who should be expected to take full business
responsibility for his unit. The corporate top-management group is, in
effect, “support” to the heads of the individual businesses.</p>
<p>“We sometimes replace the president of one of our divisions,” one of
the top men at American Home Products explained in the early fifties.
“But we never overrule him. He is expected to consult us; to ask for our
opinions; and to keep us informed. But when it comes to a decision with
respect to his own business, he makes it. If he is not willing to do
this and wants us to make the decisions for him, we have no choice but
to replace him, no matter how effective he may be in day-to-day
operations. Otherwise we cannot do our top-management job.”</p>
<p>This means that the people who run the individual units have to take
the responsibility for keeping corporate top management informed
regarding their own business. Corporate top management is their team—and
they owe to it the information and education which a team leader always
owes to his team members.</p>
<p>The “synergetic” fair-sized business, finally, has to be organized on
two axes. It is a unified business, a system, and as such requires
strong, unified top management, and es- pecially unified planning. But
its individual units are both autonomous and interdepend-</p>
<p>ent.</p>
<p>Corporate top management must see—and manage—the company as one unit.
Yet each unit is a business of its own. Each has to be able to stand on
its own feet; no business in such a synergetic system can ever be
allowed to be merely a cost center, justified by its contribution to its
sister businesses rather than by its own results. Each has to be a
leader in its field, have clear business objectives, understand its key
activities, and be organized to perform them. But each business also
depends on the other. The head of each unit, therefore, has to know what
goes on in all others, and has to be concerned with them.</p>
<p>There are therefore, three kinds of top-management teams in the
synergetic fair-sized business—and they better make sure that they play
according to the rules that govern each of these three different teams.
There is, first, of course, a top-management team for the entire
group—very similar to the top-management team required by the business
based on true federal decentralization. Then, there has to be a
top-management team for each unit, again similar to what each American
Home Products division required several decades ago.</p>
<p>But the heads of each division are also of necessity, together with
corporate top man- agement, a distinct top-management team. They have to
work out the relationships among the different ventures. They have to
think through how each of these ventures affects the others. They have
to think through in what form they have to make their contribution to
each other. They have, in other words, to look upon themselves as being
responsible both for their own unit and for the health and performance
of all the others.</p>
<p>All three types of fair-sized businesses are prone to the same
degenerative disease: flabbiness. In a fair-sized business, great care
is required to make sure that fat is not mis- taken for muscle and
business volume for business performance.</p>
<p>The fair-sized business is particularly susceptible to marginal
ventures. A well- managed fair-sized business is a business of high
competence within its area. It usually does with great ease, indeed
without apparent effort, what many other businesses find hard to do and
often cannot do at all. It is therefore likely to have great
self-confidence. At the same time, it is a business that, precisely
because of its competence, does not offer great excitement. “Crises” are
comparatively rare. Everybody knows what he is expected to do and does
it. And there is often, therefore, in the fair-sized business a strong
desire for doing new and “exciting” things; a strong push for
adventure.</p>
<p>And it seems so easy then to tackle things to which one’s competence,
one’s knowl- edge, one’s expertise, would be applicable. Indeed the
management people in a well-run fair-sized business always wonder why
other businesses, in what to them seem closely related areas, are not
doing better. They always think that if they only went into this new
product line, or that new market, they could easily establish leadership
there.</p>
<p>Yet few things are harder to predict than the extent to which
knowledge and expertise in one area can be transferred to another.</p>
<p>The secret of success for a fair-sized business is concentration of
effort. Sony in Japan has refused to go beyond its specific ecological
niche and to engage in ventures beyond it. At the same time, it clearly
has a policy of doing nothing marginal. Each product line, each market,
apparently has to stand on its own feet and has to meet high performance
standards of its own. This policy of concentration made Sony, within
fifteen years, into one of the world’s best known fair-sized companies.
A few years later, in the early 1970s, Sony then grew from being
fair-sized to being a genuinely big business.</p>
<p>In those areas in which excellence is required to obtain objectives,
a fair-sized busi- ness better behave as if it were a big business.
These areas need strength. They need re- sources. They need high demands
and insistence on performance. But in all other areas, only the
minimum—or less—should ever be done. A fair-sized business is a business
which has leadership in a fairly narrow but already visible and
important area. To main- tain this leadership position is the secret of
success in a fair-sized business. To dilute it is to court failure.</p>
<p>The fair-sized business is, perhaps, best suited of all business
sizes for successful in- novation. But the innovative efforts should
strengthen the basic unity of the business rather than dilute it. They
should capitalize on the strengths of the business. Particularly in</p>
<p>the fair-sized business that is a configuration of autonomous small
businesses—e.g., the American Home Products of the early
1950s—innovation should be directed toward de- veloping new small
businesses with high growth potential but with the same basic charac-
teristics; that is, businesses in which rhe skill and knowledge of the
fair-sized business can have full play. For a fair-sized business is
strong precisely because it has excellence in a clearly defined area or
a clearly defined market.</p>
<p>In a synergetic fair-sized business, innovation should aim at
exploiting the “franchise”</p>
<p>of the company, its acceptance by a segment of the market, or its
special knowledge in one area.</p>
<p>A fair-sized business requires, in sum, great managerial
self-discipline. It requires the willingness to support, with full
resources, the efforts and areas on which the success of the business
has been built. It requires self-restraint and almost austerity in all
other areas. The well-managed fair-sized business is a business that
knows what its business is and what it should be, and that purposefully
and systematically concentrates its resources— and especially its
resources of performing key people—toward the attainment of its basic
mission.</p>
<p>The Big Business</p>
<p>The small and the fair-sized business belong essentially in the same
category. The group on the performance of which the success of the
business depends is still small enough and cohesive enough to know each
other personally and to be in continuing personal contact with each
other. The aim of management in these businesses is to make these
direct, close, intimate personal relationships fully effective through
direction, system, and structure.</p>
<p>The definition of a big business is that the top-management group, no
matter how large, no longer knows personally every key performer, no
longer works with each of them directly, no longer constitutes a
self-disciplining team. The big business has to be impersonal.</p>
<p>Once the business has reached the point at which the top-management
group can no longer know the key people personally and directly, it has,
in effect, reached the final stage in size. From there on, additional
managerial needs and demands are caused by in- creasing complexity
rather than by increasing size.</p>
<p>A big business has to organize properly the formal, the objective
structure. Relation- ships, information about people, and mobilization
of individual energies have to be built into a structure which, of
necessity, has to be impersonal, based on policies, on objec- tives, on
abstract definitions of jobs and of contributions, and on the routines
of proce- dures. The big business requires clarity.</p>
<p>People in the big business no longer easily know each other. They no
longer know from daily experience what the other man’s job is and how he
goes about performing it. They no longer have immediate access to final
results and therefore cannot easily direct their own work and efforts
toward contribution and performance. They need to know the objectives of
the business and its priorities; its strategies and its goals; their own
position within the structure and their relationship to others.
Otherwise a big business degenerates into bureaucracy where observing
the proprieties becomes more important than results, and procedure is
mistaken for productivity.</p>
<p>The big business, almost by definition, needs to employ a number of
organization structures. It is far too big to be organized on the
functional principle. Wherever possible, therefore, it needs to employ
federal decentralization. And where this is not available to it, e.g.,
in a process industry or a commercial bank, it needs to experiment wth
simulated decentralization. But it also needs teams. Indeed it is in the
big business where the func- tion becomes the man’s “home” rather than
his “place of work,” and where the profes- sional is most likely to make
his greatest contribution as a member of one or several teams.</p>
<p>This, however, also requires clear thinking about the manager’s job.
It requires that the job be defined in terms of contribution and
assignment, but also in terms of its posi-</p>
<p>tion in decision strategy, in the flow of information, and in terms
of relationships. And in the big business, both the development of
management and the development of managers become crucial.</p>
<p>A big business requires, practically without exception, a number of
top management teams. It requires, therefore, that top-management
activities become clearly identified, clearly defined, and firmly
assigned. And in a big business the key activities will always include a
number of conscience areas.</p>
<p>The big business also needs the “executive secretariat” or the
“business research group” discussed in Chapter 51, to make its top
management effective. Otherwise the top- management teams will lose
cohesion. Or else they will spend far too much of their time on
“coordinating,” far too much time on jurisdictional conflicts and on
clearing up misun- derstandings. Top management in the big business is
too complex a function not to have its own organ of information,
stimulation, thinking, and communications.</p>
<p>Big business is therefore, of necessity, highly structured, complex,
formal—and not very fast.</p>
<p>This implies that big business should not, as a rule, engage in
small-business ventures.</p>
<p>At least it should not engage in any venture which, if reasonably
successful, will not de- velop into a fair-sized business. Small
businesses cannot afford the overhead of a big business, its formal
management structure, its job descriptions and administration, its
staffs, or its formal planning and budgetary. Big business cannot do
without these tools.</p>
<p>Big business management also lacks the “feel” for small business. It
is unlikely to un- derstand it and it will therefore make the wrong
decisions. Yet, to innovate, big business needs to start small ventures;
for the new always starts small. Big business therefore needs to be able
to set up and tolerate the innovative team (see Chapter 61, “The
Innovative Organization”) as both part of, and outside of, its structure
at one and the same time. But big business also needs systematic
attempts to introduce flexibility and even “disorder” into what
otherwise easily becomes a straitjacket of rules and procedures.</p>
<p>Top management, in particular, needs to work on direct face-to-face
relationships with people throughout the organization and especially
with the younger professional contribu- tors. It needs to organize
itself to sit down with people throughout the organization, to listen to
them, to help them focus their vision on the objectives and
opportunities of the business rather than on their own functional or
technical work, and above all, to get to know them.</p>
<p>But the personal relationships which give flexibility to the big
business and establish the habit of cooperation between what otherwise
might well become rigid bureaucrats cannot be left to top management
alone—though they will not develop unless top man- agement works at
them. Management development within big business has as one of its major
duties the creation of personal bonds and relationships throughout the
organization.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is for managers and professionals to grow up
together and to get to know each other in their work. When they reach
positions of responsibility, they should know enough people in all areas
of the company to be able to go directly to the “right” man if something
needs to be done in a hurry and “outside of channels.” Teams in a big
business are therefore a good deal more than organizational designs for
specific tasks, such as innovation or special studies. In the big
business the team in which people from various areas and from various
kinds of work join together in a common effort and as colleagues is
“management development.” It is building the capacity for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Danger of Becoming Inbred</p>
<p>A big business needs to guard against the danger of becoming insular
and inbred. Most of its managers and professionals are not, in their
daily work, in direct contact with the out- side world. They work
inside. It is in the big business where the law of surface and mass
creates the need for special organs but also dictates that these special
organs will further insulate an already insulated inside.</p>
<p>The members of the top-management teams in the big business,
therefore, have a par- ticular responsibility for becoming the “sensing”
organ for the outside, the eyes and ears of the organization. If they
remove themselves from market and customer and come to rely on reports
and inside information, they will soon lose their ability to sense and
antici- pate changes in the market and to perceive, let alone to
appreciate, the unexpected.</p>
<p>If they insulate themselves from knowledge other than that peculiar
to the industry or to the company, they will soon lose their capacity
for technological or social understand- ing and insight. If they confine
their working contacts to people inside the organization, or to people
from other businesses who do exactly the same work—as most
top-management people are prone to do—they will soon become unable to
understand how ordinary human beings behave. They will soon fall into
the old fallacy of saying, “There is a right way and a wrong way and our
way.” They need to organize themselves for productive working time
outside of their own business, and indeed outside their own
industry.</p>
<p>But the new, the different, the outside view also has to be injected
into the organiza- tion itself. The big business which relies
exclusively on promotion from within breeds complacency, rigidity, and
blind adherence to custom. The big business needs a system- atic policy
for bringing in outsiders to fill positions of substantial
responsibility.</p>
<p>It is an admission of bankruptcy for a big business to have to go on
the outside to re- cruit into top management. It is also a desperate
gamble. There is no certainty, indeed, not even high probability, that
the newcomer will “take.” But if he is not the right man, it is
difficult and indeed risky—and at the least most painful—to get rid of
him again. At the same time, the outsider who comes into a junior
position has no power and little chance of being heard. And by the time
he reaches a position of influence and responsibility, he has of course,
become an insider.</p>
<p>Upper-middle management positions are the positions into which people
from the out- side should be brought with fair regularity. It might be
company policy to fill a small pro- portion of such positions with
people who have not come up in business but have made their careers in
other institutions.</p>
<p>New work should, preferably, be filled from the inside unless it
requires such special talents or such special technical and professional
background as to make going on the outside absolutely necessary. New
work, by definition, is difficult and certain to run into trouble. There
is therefore a premium on staffing it with people whose capacity to per-
form is proven and known—and that one only knows of the insider. New
work always requires acceptance on faith on the part of the
organization. For it takes always a good long time before any new work
produces results. In the beginning therefore all new work will be
received with skepticism within the organization, will tend to be
considered a “fad,” will be controversial. And then the insider whose
capacity to perform has been tested will be accepted because he is known
and trusted.</p>
<p>The outsider should, as a rule, be brought into work that is known
and, by and large, already done. But he should be brought in with the
express understanding that it is his job to take a critical look at the
way the work is being performed and to suggest new and dif- ferent ways
of doing it. He should be brought in with the understanding that he is
to ask questions, suggest changes, and be altogether a “disorganizer.”
This is an uncomfortable role. It is also one that an organization
tolerates only if it is being done on a fairly regular basis and is not
a “sensation” every time.</p>
<p>Top management needs to know what size its top-management group
actually is and needs to adopt a strategy and build a structure
appropriate to the size of the business. For size is not, as most
managements seem to believe, intuitively obvious. On the contrary, a
great many businesses do not know what size they are and know even less
what the right strategies and the right structures are for their size.
There are countless small businesses which load themselves down with
expensive staffs in areas which have little to do with the performance
and results of the business. There are countless fair-sized businesses
which fritter away their strengths on marginal activities, marginal
products, and marginal mar- kets. There are countless big businesses
whose top managements suffer from the delusion that they are really “one
small happy family.” There are indeed many big businesses in</p>
<p>which top management is the victim and prisoner of its own inanities,
such as “I still know every man in the plant by his first name,” or, “My
door is always open.” There are countless big businesses which, as a
result, are essentially unmanaged. But there are also a great many big
businesses which believe that formal structure and rules are all that is
needed and which, as a result of neglecting direct human relationships
and the develop- ment of management and managers become byzantine,
rigid, and riddled with bureauc- racy, protocol, and intrigue.</p>
<p>Management needs to know what size its business is. But management
also needs to know whether its business is the right size or the wrong
size.</p>

<p>B</p>
<p>EING THE WRONG SIZE is a chronic, debilitating, wasting—and a very
com- mon—disease. Being the wrong size is curable in the majority of
cases. But the cure is neither easy nor pleasant. Managements of
companies afflicted with the disease usually resist taking the right
medicine. The cures most managements prefer instead are quackery and
almost certain to aggravate the disease and to make it permanent.</p>
<p>There are many causes for being the wrong size. In certain industries
the minimum vi- able size for a business is very large. It is almost as
impossible, under conditions of pre- sent-day technology, to be a “small
steel company” as it is to be a “small army.” It is al- most impossible
to be a “small petroleum company,” or to be a small company and suc-
cessful in petrochemistry. In fields like those, a small or even a
fair-sized business can survive only if it occupies a distinct
ecological niche that removes it from competition with the industry’s
giants.</p>
<p>In some industries it is the big business that is apparently not
viable. One example may be trade book publishing in the United States.
Publishing houses which publish books for the general reader, whether
fiction or nonfiction (which are known as “trade books” in the
publishing industry), apparently are not likely to be successful unless
small or fair-sized. Trade book publishers that exceed fair size rapidly
build up such overhead expenses, require so much administration, so much
promotion expense, and so large a selling staff as to become marginal.
No such restriction on size seems to apply to publish- ers of textbooks,
technical books, or of “near-books,” such as encyclopedias and refer-
ence books.</p>
<p>There are industries in which a big business and a small business can
prosper. But the in-between businesses, the fair-sized business, is the
“wrong size.” One such industry seems to be the domestic airlines in the
U.S. The trunk lines, that is, the very big airlines such as American
Airlines and TWA, are viable. And so are some “feeder” or commuter
lines, such as PSA on the Pacific West Coast, which give frequent
service to a local, or at least a narrowly circumscribed, territory. The
regional carriers, a Western Airlines or Northeastern, apparently are
not viable. They are too small to have the revenues of the large trunk
carriers, and too large to have the economics of the small local
lines.</p>
<p>What is the right or the wrong size may well change from one period
of time to an- other. Since the end of World War II the size needed to
be an effective competitor in the world economy has changed, for
instance. The middle size is becoming the wrong size. What was a
respectably large international business of perfectly adequate size
thirty or even twenty-five years earlier had, by the early 1970s, become
the wrong size. At the same time, many businesses that are small or, at
best, fair-sized have shown themselves capable of establishing a
distinct leadership position in a distinct ecological niche in the world
economy. The successful multinational company apparently is either very
big or fairly small.</p>
<p>But many more companies are the wrong size because of something that
they them- selves do or fail to do. Typical of the company that is the
wrong size is the fair-sized business, perhaps with 0 to 0 million in
sales, of which about three-quarters are in products and in markets in
which the company has a leadership position while 25 percent of total
sales are in marginal products or in marginal markets in which the
company has, in effect, no business to be. At the same time,
three-quarters or more of the efforts and resources of the company go
toward these marginal products and markets. The company, because of its
earlier achievements, still has a strong position in its main market.
But whatever profit it derives therefrom is swallowed up by the marginal
25 percent, and so are the company’s resources, especially strong
people. As a result, the company’s leader- ship position in its original
market and product line is being steadily eroded and will not last very
long.</p>
<p>Or, typically, there is the company which, in order to obtain orders
for its main prod- uct, has to give away, as “market promotion,” efforts
or products which far exceed in value what the customer pays.</p>
<p>The school furniture division of a well-known American company in the
1950s and 1960s was recognized throughout the industry as the quality
“leader.” It had almost 60 percent of the school furniture market, at
least for new school buildings; and its products commanded a substantial
premium over the products of its competitors. Yet the company lost money
year after year, and the more it increased its sales and market
position, the bigger were its losses. In order to get the contract for
supplying the furniture for a new million school—a contract worth,
maybe, 0,000 or 0,000—the company’s sales peo- ple had to work with the
school board, the architectural firm, or the state engineers, from the
moment the plans for the school first emerged until the school was
finished, four or five years later. The 0,000 contract on furnishing a
new school produces at best a gross profit of 5,000. In order to obtain
it, however, the company had to give free consulting services which,
however conservatively priced, cost more than any profit it could
possibly realize from getting the final sale.</p>
<p>But even what looks at first sight like a problem of industry or
market structure may well be one of managerial mistake or managerial
failure to understand what the “right size” implies for a given
business. American Motors, for instance, is clearly the wrong size in
the American automobile market with an annual sales volume of 300,000
passen- ger cars. But at the very time at which American Motors with a
billion dollars in sales and a sales volume of 300,000 cars a year was
declared a small business and deserving of special financial subsidies,
Volkswagen had become perfectly viable, indeed a highly successful
competitor in the American automobile market with then still
substantially lower volume.</p>
<p>While the causes of being the wrong size may be obscure, the
diagnosis is simple. The symptoms are clear and are always the same. In
a business that is the wrong size, there is always one area, activity,
function, or effort—or at most a very few—which is out of all proportion
and hypertrophied. This area has to be so big, requires so much effort,
and imposes so much cost on the business as to make economic performance
and results im- possible. No matter how much revenue the business can
produce, the hypertrophied area will always absorb more. It is of a
magnitude, weight, or complexity out of all proportion to any achievable
results. And yet it is needed, is indeed still too small, in the
typical</p>
<p>business of the wrong size to satisfy the demands and to support the
volume, the product line, or the market standing of the company.</p>
<p>American Motors’s basic problem is its weak distribution system. It
simply does not have enough dealers. And outside of a few regions where
American Motors is firmly en- trenched such as the Northeast and
California, the dealers are too small and do not do a good enough job,
whether in sales or in service. Yet it is the cost burden of its
distribution system which cripples American Motors. Being in direct
competition with the Big Three—General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler—and
offering essentially the same lines of automobiles in the lower and
middle price ranges, American Motors is forced, by the structure of the
distribution system for automobiles in the United States, to maintain a
nationwide selling and servicing network. This requires costs which
could be borne only if American Motors had twice the sales volume. To
maintain its competitive position, it has to change its models as often
as the Big Three do and has then to furnish its dealers with all the
parts for all the models on the market so as to give a minimum of
service. Yet the dealers do not have enough volume to build strong
service departments in many areas. Hence, American Motors does not
attract or hold dealers with sufficient capital and suffi- cient selling
ability to build leadership positions in their communities. American
Motors, in other words, is caught in a vicious circle. To obtain the
sales volume which would make it viable, it has to incur distribution
expenses way out of proportion to revenues and has actually to increase
its distribution expenses disproportionately just to stay in its mar-
ket. But at the same time, it does not generate the revenue that would
make such distribu- tion costs economically bearable.</p>
<p>Another example is a company which is in serious trouble even though
it has leader- ship position in its field and adequate sales volume. But
all its sales are concentrated in a very small period of time each year,
either a few weeks or, at most, a few months. Yet to obtain this sales
volume, the company needs substantial research and development work and,
above all, continuous high-quality technical service in the field. These
technical ser- vices have to be maintained at a level adequate to
support the peak sales volume. They have to be maintained and paid
twelve months in the year to obtain six weeks of sales. The company is
justly proud of its technical excellence. But it cannot afford the cost
bur- den this imposes. The disproportion between income obtainable in
six weeks and the cost of maintaining service excellence all year round
is simply too great.</p>
<p>These examples illustrate the basic problem of the business that is
the wrong size. The expenses of such a business are always proportionate
to the sale of the hypertrophied ac- tivity or function. Efforts and
costs are always, and in any structure, whether biological or social,
determined by the largest part or the largest organ. But the revenue is,
of course, determined by the actual performance, the actual results. It
is therefore never adequate to support the business of the wrong size.
The hypertrophied function, while absolutely nec- essary—or so it always
seems—constitutes a permanent drain on the business. It saps its
energies and deprives it of resources. And, like a cancer, it is
insatiable and always de- mands “more.” This makes being the wrong size
a degenerative disease. Radical action is needed to cure it and to
re-create a business that is of the right size, a business in which
attainable revenues can support the needed activities.</p>
<p>What Works and What Doesn’t</p>
<p>The normal response of management in a business of the wrong size is
to try to bring the sales of the business up to the size required to
support the hypertrophied function. It is to plan for “growth” which, it
is hoped, will bring about balance.</p>
<p>Again American Motors furnishes the example. Since the late fifties,
the company has tried several times to raise its sales volume. In the
spring of 1972 American Motors an- nounced once more a plan aggressively
to recruit new and strong dealers and to push its sales up to 600,000
cars a year, almost twice its then current volume. It again decided to
increase its distribution expenses to produce the needed volume. Such a
strategy might conceivably work, but the odds are against it. In order
to obtain the sales volume that</p>
<p>would give the business a viable size, the expenses which make the
business nonviable have to be increased—as the American Motors example
shows. And this is precisely what the business cannot afford. The great
probability is that such a strategy will have to be abandoned, and often
just when it is beginning to bear results.</p>
<p>A company may have no choice but to attempt such a strategy. But it
is a strategy of despair. It should be considered only as a last resort.
Unfortunately most managements consider it the only available strategy
and the one to use, and to use again, whether it shows results or
not.</p>
<p>A comparison between American Motors and Volkswagen shows the
difference be- tween being the wrong size as a result of lack of
distinction, and being the right size by occupying a distinct ecological
niche. In sales volume in the American market American Motors still had
a substantial edge in the mid-sixties. But American Motors, offering the
same cars as the Big Three to the same American buyer, engaged in
direct, head-on com- petition with the products of General Motors, Ford,
and Chrysler, and had to bear the same costs of an annual model change.
Volkswagen, however, at that time offered only the “Beetle” and the
Minibus. Neither was in competition with Detroit. Neither was aimed at
the choice customers for new cars. The Beetle was bought by people who
otherwise would have bought a second-hand car. And there was then no car
on the American market in competition with the Minibus. Volkswagen did
not offer an annual model change but rather emphasized that its models
remained the same year after year—which enabled Volkswagen to offer
excellent service to its American customers with a minimum of parts
inventory and therefore of dealer capital.</p>
<p>But how does one turn oneself from being an “American Motors” into a
“Volks- wagen”?</p>
<p>Two lessons, both from the same industry, but each of a different
strategy, are con- tained in the conversion of the “artificial silk”
companies into different businesses when the petrochemical textile
fibers, beginning with nylon, made them the “wrong size” after World War
II.</p>
<p>Unti1 then the “artificial silks,” such as rayon, had enjoyed
distinction. The major chemical companies, by and large, lacked
scientific and technical knowledge to enter the field; the artificial
silks were based on wood pulp, which is a material the chemical com-
panies know nothing about. And the petroleum companies had no incentive
before the late 1940s to enter a field which did not utilize any of
their products. With the advent of the petrochemical fibers this changed
drastically. The chemical companies now suddenly had the technical
expertise, and they had also the means to mount massive research
etforts. For the petroleum companies, petrochemical fibers became a
highly attractive way to bring their product, crude oil, to the market.
They also had the cash flow to support mas- sive investments. The old
artificial silk companies could not compete with the much lar- ger
chemica1 companies in massive research. Nor could they compete with the
cash flow of the large oil companies. Yet, the artificial silk companies
had to become producers of the new petrochemical fibers or perish.</p>
<p>The two leading artificial silk companies in Great Britain and the
United States, re- spectively, Courtaulds and Celanese Corporation of
America, reestablished themselves as viable businesses within distinct
ecological niches in which they again had leadership positions. Both
restored themselves to the right size. But they followed different
strate- gies.</p>
<p>Courtaulds integrated forward, mainly through the acquisition of
major customers for textile fibers, that is, fabric producers. It
thereby assured itself of a market for its own petrochemical fibers, but
also of the ability to use other producers’ fibers and to make a profit
on them.</p>
<p>Celanese Corporation of America remained essentially a producer of
textile fibers rather than a producer of textile fabrics (even though it
too made some acquisitions among textile converters). But it developed a
strategy of becoming the preferred channel through which other—and
particularly non-American—companies would bring their syn- thetic
petrochemical fibers into the American market. Celanese, in other words,
built its strategy on its marketing strength, which then offered such
non-American giants as Impe- rial Chemicals of Great Britain a vehicle
for obtaining market position and leadership in the U.S. for their
research results, which otherwise would have been very expensive to
obtain.</p>
<p>Both companies essentially exploited their knowledge of the market in
a manner suited to their economy. The Courtaulds strategy would not have
worked in the United States, where the textile industry is too big and
too diversified for any one outside sup- plier to obtain by acquisition
a dominant position. In Great Britain, on the other hand, the Celanese
strategy would not have worked. For the major non-British producers of
petro- chemical fibers, especially the Americans, prefer marketing their
own products worldwide and would not have been receptive to the
licensing strategy which Celanese developed and exploited
successfully.</p>
<p>These two examples show that the strategy of changing the economic
characteristics of one’s business to overcome the problem of the wrong
size is an exceedingly difficult one. It is highly risky. Not only is
failure of the effort risky. There is an even greater risk, that of
making a successful effort only to find out that it has not really
changed anything. It is most difficult indeed to say in advance what
strategy will produce a business that has different economic
characteristics and what strategy will work only in the short run, no
matter how successful, and might, in the long run, make things even
worse.</p>
<p>American Motors again supplies a clear illustration. The first
attempt to cure its size problem was the design of the “compact” in the
early fifties. The compact car was a smaller version of what up till
then had been the Detroit “standard” car; cheaper, but also more adapted
to heavy traffic and to parking in congested cities, and yet a
full-service car, giving the American family the space to which it had
become accustomed. It was an in- stantaneous success and produced
substantial results for American Motors for a few years. But it was a
pyrrhic victory and in the end made American Motors’ position worse than
it had been before. For there was nothing to the compact which the Big
Three could not easily do just as well. It fitted their dealer system,
their design and engineering exper- tise, and their production
facilities far better than it did American Motors’s. And so American
Motors, in effect, achieved little except to create a market for the Big
Three, a market in which again it found itself to be the wrong size.</p>
<p>In retrospect it is easy to see that the compact was the wrong
strategy for American Motors. But it is also easy to see why, in the
1950s, the compact appeared to be the solu- tion to American Motors’s
management and the means for transforming the business into the right
size.</p>
<p>Merger and Acquisition</p>
<p>The second strategy, and one that is much less risky, is to try to
cure the size problem by merger or acquisition. Indeed, being the wrong
size is one of the few cases where serious thought about merger or
acquisition is a must. The problem cannot, to repeat, be cured by growth
from within as a rule. It requires a “quantum jump.” And this, of
course, merger and acquisition can provide.</p>
<p>The aim of such a merger or acquisition must not, however, be volume,
as such. To pile additional volume on the wrong foundation is asking for
trouble. The aim is to try to find the missing piece that, put together
with what one has, will result in a genuine whole.</p>
<p>The aim is to find a business that also suffers from being the wrong
size—but for the op- posite reasons. If a company needs to have an
oversized distribution system or an over- sized research effort to stay
in business, it needs to look for a business which has too large a
product line for its distribution system or its research capacities. At
the same time, to make it the right fit, the product lines of the two
businesses should be compatible; that is, should be able to use the same
distribution system or the same research capacity.</p>
<p>The merger and acquisition strategy therefore requires understanding
of the reasons why one’s business is the wrong size. But if they are
clearly understood and if the proper match can be arranged, the cure is
likely to be rapid and complete.</p>
<p>Sale and Divestment</p>
<p>The final strategy for the business that is the wrong size is sale,
divestment, or systematic shrinkage. It is a strategy managements as a
rule find so distasteful that they rarely even consider it. Yet it is by
all odds the one most likely to succeed. Wherever applicable, it should
be adopted.</p>
<p>It should always be followed if the wrong size is the result of
expanding from the strong and secure foundation of leadership into a lot
of marginal areas. The fair-sized business which dilutes its strength by
building a lot of “beachheads” without ever securing a beach should
withdraw its forces and cut back on its efforts. It should admit that it
has made a mistake. This is not just a strategy for the small and
fair-sized business. It is equally important to the big business which,
for whatever reason, finds itself in a marginal area in which it is the
wrong size.</p>
<p>In the early seventies, General Electric sold off its computer
business to Honeywell. It had proven to be the wrong size. It was much
too big to do anything but compete head-on in the major computer
markets. Yet it was much too small to be a serious challenger to IBM.
Combined with Honeywell, which by that time had already established
itself as a successful computer manufacturer of small to medium-sized
computers, the new company had enough business to support the massive
research effort, the tremendous sales effort needed in the computer
business, and the capital investment. Had General Electric not acted
when there was still someone to sell its computer business to but waited
only a year or two longer, it would, like its closest competitor in the
computer market, RCA, have had to close out the computer business and
take a tremendous loss.</p>
<p>In his essay “On Being the Right Size,” J.B.S. Haldane in 1928
concluded that “small” and “large” were meaningless terms for biological
organisms. The right size mat- tered, whether that was being small like
the termite, or large like the elephant, both being highly successful
species. The same can be said for a business. Absolute size by itself is
no indicator of success and achievement, let alone of managerial
competence. Being the</p>
<p>right size is.</p>
<p>Can a Company Be Too Big?</p>
<p>Whether a company can be too big to be manageable is an old question.
There can be little doubt that a company can become too complex. Indeed
some of today’s multina- tional conglomerates are clearly at the very
bounds of manageability. But mere bigness by itself seems so far not to
have reached proportions which exceed manageability. Our ca- pacity to
structure and to organize the management job has so far kept pace with
bigness in business.</p>
<p>This does not, however, mean that there is no limit beyond which size
will become unmanageable. It only means that the typical business,
whether manufacturing or service business, has not yet reached it. Other
institutions, however, clearly have.</p>
<p>The Unmanageable Service Institution</p>
<p>One example is today’s defense establishment of a major power such as
that of the United States. It was right in the late forties to unify the
American armed services, or at least to put them under unified command.
There was essentially no alternative. But the resulting</p>
<p>monster is so big that it defies control. Indeed, what the first
Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, is reported to have said of the
unified armed services of the United States in the late forties, only
half in jest, has been proven to be true: “The peacetime mission of the
armed services of the United States is to destroy the Secretary of
Defense.”</p>
<p>We know that a hospital becomes increasingly less manageable when it
exceeds 1,000 beds or so. And the very large hospitals—for instance,
those monsters among New York City, hospitals, Bellevue and Kings County
with 3,000 to 4,000 beds apiece—are clearly too big for effective
management and decent patient care.</p>
<p>But there are also businesses which are too big, or at least so big
as to bump clearly against a limitation on their manageability. They are
to be found among the business ser- vice businesses, such as consulting,
auditing, and advertising.</p>
<p>The large multinational auditing firm with 5,000 or 6,000
professionals spread over 120 offices in thirty or forty countries is
not manageable. More and more of the top peo- ple spend more and more of
their time trying to coordinate, administer, and hold together this vast
mess of professionals, each of whom supposedly has to do his own work in
his own way and yet to exacting professional standards. The same may be
true of the very large management-consulting firms or of the advertising
agencies with offices in thirty or forty countries serving multinational
as well as local clients.</p>
<p>Business services depend on the ability of the top people to give
personal example and at the same time to know what goes on. But one
cannot give personal example to 6,000 professional people spread out
over many countries. One cannot have direct knowledge of 400 to 500
consulting assignments or “assignment teams,” each of which has to be
able to do its own work without much supervision and yet with high
professional standards of quality.</p>
<p>In business service firms, therefore, the question of the absolute
limit should be taken most seriously. And long before this limit is
being approached the business service firm is well advised to split
itself into a number of independent and competing firms. Each of these
“daughters” is likely to do better than the overweight parent.</p>
<p>Service staffs within a business or within a public-service
institution can also—and easily—become too large to be manageable and to
function. Like the business service firm, they depend on the competence,
knowledge, and attention of a limited number of high-grade
professionals. A service staff that gets big either dilutes this
personal quality or it becomes so busy running itself, worrying about
its own internal machinery and its own “inside” concerns, that it ceases
to give service.</p>
<p>An example is the big service staffs which some of the conglomerates
have built up to supply expertise and leadership in specific
areas—manufacturing, for instance— “across the board” to a multitude of
subsidiaries and affiliates each engaged in a different busi- ness and
supplying a different market. One such conglomerate has, for instance,
around 300 different “businesses,” ranging from quite small to very
large, from near-commodity businesses (e.g., bakeries making bread) to
highly technological businesses and to busi- nesses engaged entirely in
such service operations as shipping or hotels. The manufactur- ing
services staff of the company has 900 members—far too many for each of
them to be a truly first-rate man, capable of directing and managing
himself. Indeed, of the 900 al- most one-third do not do any “services”
work but administer the staff itself. Yet, the staff is too big to be
manageable—there is endless confusion, constant friction, and’ ceaseless
meetings to debate what work to do, when, where, and how—and very little
time for the work. Yet the staff is too small to serve a client
effectively. In such work one has first to know a fair amount about the
specific manufacturing process the client uses—and no one can master 300
processes. But also to serve a client with any impact one has to be able
to give a few days a year exclusively to his problems. There are 300
clients. Manufacturing, as the company understands the term, is broken
down into almost twenty “sub- disciplines” from assembly operations to
production scheduling. To be able to give five days a year to one of the
client businesses—probably the minimum needed—would there- fore require
a staff at least three times its present size—and an overhead burden to
match. As it is, the staff can only grind out memoranda, make “formal
presentations,” and write</p>
<p>theoretical treatises on the “principles of production scheduling”
which duplicate what is available in the management literature at a tiny
fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>Institutions, in other words, can well be too big. But as far as
individual businesses are concerned there has, so far, been no example
of a company that outgrew its manageabil- ity—the way the U.S.
Department of Defense, the giant hospital, the multinational audit- ing
firm, and the service staff in the conglomerate have outgrown manageable
size. Espe- cially where federal decentralization (see Chapter 46) can
be applied, even very large businesses are apparently still within the
limits of manageability.</p>
<p>The Optimum Point</p>
<p>There is, however, also an optimum point—and it may well have been
reached by some of the giants—beyond which additional size no longer
improves performance capacity but begins to impede it. The optimum size
may, in other words, be well below maximum size. And such a business
would be well advised to consider splitting itself.</p>
<p>The prime example has for three-quarters of a century been U.S.
Steel, the giant of the American steel industry. Consistently it has
done far worse than its smaller competitors. The optimum size in the
American steel industry, judging by performance—whether this be defined
as profitability or as leadership in innovation—seems to be that of
companies such as Armco, Republic, or Inland Steel which, while very big
businesses indeed, are no more than a third the size of “Big Steel.”</p>
<p>Very big companies should test themselves to find the point beyond
which further size no longer produces economies of scale but on the
contrary produces dis-economies. Where in terms of size is the point of
diminishing returns for a given business? At that point the management
owes it to its trust—it owes it to employees, shareholders, the
community—not to grow but rather to think through how to give birth to
new independent businesses that then have the capacity for growth and
can benefit again from the econo- mies of scale.</p>
<p>One public-service institution has done this successfully. The
University of Toronto in Canada decided around 1960 that it would not
grow beyond 15,000 students. At the same time, it also realized that
there was need for university growth in the province of Ontario. It
therefore embarked on a systematic program of starting new universities,
supplying them with faculty and staff for the first few years,
subsidizing and guiding them for a short time, but cutting them loose as
soon as they were graduating their first class. The new institutions,
such as York University (also in Toronto though in a different part of
the city), have shown remarkable vigor. They very rapidly developed into
institutions with their own profile, their own personality, and their
own educational philosophy, thus offer- ing students in Ontario a choice
between different approaches to higher education.</p>
<p>In business, however, such strategies are so far very rare.</p>
<p>The closest is the strategy of Johnson andandandand Johnson in New
Brunswick, New Jersey. This manufacturer of medical and sanitary
supplies has long had a policy of starting a “new company” as soon as
any new product or new market reaches appreciable size. By this method
it has kept businesses reasonably small and highly manageable. And yet
Johnson andandandand Johnson itself has been able to grow into a truly
big multinational company, and one of the most productive and profitable
ones.</p>
<p>Too Big for the Environment</p>
<p>But the major problem of bigness in business is not internal. It is
not manageability. It is the company that is too big in relation to its
environment.</p>
<p>Any company is too big when it no longer can make business and
management deci- sions in the interest of the company, its stockholders,
and employees, because its size im- pairs its freedom of action. It is
too big if, out of concern for the community, or for fear of the
reaction of the community, it is forced into doing the wrong things, the
things that management itself knows will damage the business.</p>
<p>One example is General Motors. Internally GM is clearly eminently
manageable. But since the mid-twenties or so, that is, since it became
the leader of the American automo- bile industry and acquired a market
share of 50 percent or more of the total U.S. market, GM management has
known that the company cannot get a larger market share without running
into antitrust problems. This is largely the reason why GM, though fully
cogni- zant, one assumes, of the risk it ran, decided not to compete
against the small foreign im- ported automobile when it first appeared
in the 1950s and 1960s. There was no point for GM in trying to expand
its market share. In fact, there was every reason for keeping mar- ket
share where it was, that is, well below 60 percent (and this was already
a good deal higher than earlier GM managements would have considered
prudent). As a result, GM abandoned the “lower end” of the market to the
foreign imports. It concentrated on the middle and upper ends which, of
course, are the far more profitable segments of the mar- ket. But this
also meant that there was no leadership to keep the American-made
automo- bile truly competitive even in its own domestic market. By the
early seventies, when the imports had become a challenge to Detroit, and
a threat to the American balance of pay- ments and therefore to the
American position in the world economy, so much of the mar- ket had been
ceded to the imports—first the Germans with Volkswagen and then the
Japanese—that the counteroffensive had become a formidable
undertaking.</p>
<p>This is not just hindsight. A good many people, even within GM, saw
clearly in the forties that GM, with 50 percent or more of the market,
had become too big for its own good. Some of the younger staff men in GM
headquarters seriously discussed spinning off Chevrolet and setting it
up as a separate company. And Chevrolet, by itself, would have been a
very big company with something like 25 percent of the American market;
that is, larger than Ford or Chrysler.</p>
<p>Yet GM top management considered even the mere mention of a Chevrolet
spin-off to be outright treason. In the company that is too big pride
always gets in the way of man- agement vision.</p>
<p>There are quite a few companies of far smaller size than GM which are
still too big for their community. There are many companies which cannot
do the things they and their own management know to be the right things
to do for the business because they are re- strained by their size in
relation to their community.</p>
<p>The typical example is the company, perhaps even a fairly small one,
which is the dominant employer in an area. Any company which is the
mainstay of its community is too big. It can no longer move with
freedom. It has only two choices: either to become “father and mother”
to the community and to take over control of its welfare, its cultural
life, and its community organization; or, it can become the “ugly,” the
tyrant, the autocrat, the bully. And the line between the two is
blurred. Yesterday’s benefactor becomes to- day’s bully very fast. It is
indeed debatable whether the “benefactor” is harmed more by being too
big than the bully. Neither has freedom of action any more.</p>
<p>Any company which finds itself arguing, “We cannot do this no matter
how badly we need it because of the impact on the community,” is too
big. If it persists in expanding in the community, it sacrifices the
best interests of the business, but also the best interests of the
community, to the vanity and lust for power of its management. And this
is betrayal of management trust. The company may be quite small; what
matters is its relative size. The one-company, one-employer community is
healthy neither for the company nor for the community.</p>
<p>The least such a company needs to do is not to expand any further in
its community.</p>
<p>The least it needs to do is not to aggravate the situation. This is
not “social responsibil- ity.” This is business responsibility.</p>
<p>A company exploiting a natural resource, such as copper or petroleum,
has little choice. It has to establish itself where the resource is. If
this then means that it will be too big, the question is only how to
mitigate the impact. The situation itself cannot be reme- died. Anaconda
has little choice but to be “too big” in Butte, Montana. This is where
the copper is. The petroleum companies have little choice but to be “too
big” in the Arab countries along the Persian Gulf. This is where the oil
is. But companies in other indus-</p>
<p>tries, in manufacturing, in distribution, in financial and other
services, have no such ex- cuse. As soon as such a company finds that
its community has become so dependent on it that the company’s freedom
of business action and business decision is seriously im- paired, it
owes it to itself, but also to the community, to stop getting bigger and
to try to reduce, if only gradually, the mutual dependence between
business and community. It has to take effective action to reduce itself
to a size which is manageable. For being too big for one’s environment
is, in effect, to be unmanageable.</p>
<p>A company can also be too big for a particular economy. Both the
Japanese and the French governments have been forcing companies within
their own countries—in steel, for instance, and in chemicals—to merge to
be able to compete in the world economy and to hold their own against
the multinationals. The results are companies that are still not big
enough to compete on even terms in the world economy. Yet these
companies are too big for their own national economies. So many jobs
depend on them that no government could afford to see them disappear or
even to allow them to become smaller and to reduce their employment. Yet
if there is one thing predictable in business life, it is that every
business goes through a period of trouble sooner or later. If and when
this happens, the French and Japanese governments will have no choice
but to subsidize and eventually to take over these creatures of their
own policies. This, needless to say, will not improve their position or
save the companies. It will only convert an economic problem into a ma-
jor political problem. Again the villain is pride, though governmental
rather than manage- rial pride.</p>
<p>The business that is the wrong size—whether too small for its market
or for key activi- ties needed; or too big for environment, community,
or economy—is one of the toughest problems a top management can face.
But it is not a problem that will cure itself. It re- quires courage,
integrity, hard thinking, and purposeful action.</p>

will tend to be concentrated. Expectations can be defined, and results
can easily be appraised and measured.</p>
<p>The less complex a business is, the fewer things can go wrong. And
the more complex a business is, the more difficult it is to figure out
what went wrong and to take the right remedial action. Complexity
creates problems of communications. The more complex a business, the
more layers of management, the more special “coordinators,” the more
forms and procedures, the more meetings, and the more delays in making
decisions.</p>
<p>Yet for a long time the belief has been held widely that the business
that “diversifies”</p>
<p>into many areas is likely to do better than the business that
concentrates on one area. The belief is sheer myth and is contradicted
by all evidence.</p>
<p>Never was the belief in diversification as a panacea more widely held
than in the 1950s and 1960s. Yet the success stories of these years were
not the businesses that diver- sified, let alone the “conglomerates.”
They were IBM and Xerox in the U.S., Sony, Honda, and Toyota in Japan,
Fiat and Volkswagen, Pilkington Glass in England, and the Swiss
pharmaceutical companies—all businesses with one central product or
product line, one central market, one central technology. The success
story of Swedish manufacturing industry was Atlas Copco, a company that
has one main business: drilling hard rock. Con- centration rather than
diversification also characterizes the outstanding business successes
outside of manufacturing. Here the success stories are Sears, Roebuck in
the U.S., Marks andandandand Spencer in Great Britain, Donaldson, Lufkin
andandandand Jenrette, specializing in the institutional investor among
the New York Stock Exchange firms, and the Enskilda Bank in Stock- holm,
concentrating on the development of a few major Swedish industries.
Sotheby, the London-based art auctioneer, and such publishing houses as
Bertelsmann in Germany and Prentice-Hall in the United States, all major
“growth” companies, are all businesses with</p>
<p>one clear mission and one focus, and with excellence in one area, one
market, and essen- tially one product line.</p>
<p>Indeed the experience of the fifties and sixties indicates that
complexity is competitive disadvantage. Complex businesses, despite
their size and large resources, have again and again shown themselves
exceedingly vulnerable to competition by a small but highly con-
centrated single-market or single-technology business.</p>
<p>Among the “long-pull” performers the “stars” are also the highly
concentrated, single- market or single-technology businesses, e.g.,
Eastman Kodak, GM, and the Swiss phar- maceutical companies.</p>
<p>The outstanding public-service institutions similarly tend to be
single-mission institu- tions rather than diversified. In the United
States in the last thirty or forty years the exam- ples of
public-service achievement are the Port of New York Authority, the
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), Rural Electrification, or the Social
Security Administration in its earlier and relatively uncluttered days.
Each of these agencies tried to do one thing at a time. But the
“diversification craze” hit public-service agencies as hard in the
fifties and sixties as it hit businesses. It led to the emergence of the
“multiversity,” willing, indeed eager, to tackle any job anyone was
willing to give a professor a contract for; to the “con- glomerate
agencies” of the War on Poverty tackling simultaneously all social ills
known to mankind; or to the agencies of the Environmental Crusade,
concerned with every prob- lem of environment, pollution, and
technology. These newer agencies dispose of vastly bigger budgets. They
engage in scintillating intellectual debates—whereas the earlier ones
tended to be rather dull and concerned with such boring matters as
getting things done. But the new diversified or conglomerate
public-service institutions have not accomplished much.</p>
<p>The same thing applies to service staffs within businesses. The
performers are single- purpose staffs, trying to do one thing, and one
thing only. Few of the highly diversified research labs which try to
“cover all the basic sciences” have research results; those seem to
emerge mostly from labs that focus on one area, whether antibiotics or
power metal- lurgy.</p>
<p>Engineers speak half-jokingly of Murphy’s Law: “If anything can go
wrong, it will.”</p>
<p>But complexity stands under a second law as well. Let me call it
Drucker’s Law: “If one thing goes wrong, everything else will, and at
the same time.” And if anything goes wrong, then there is a premium on
knowing one’s business, on understanding it, on being close to it.
Diversity and complexity, however, mean that one cannot know one’s busi-
nesses, cannot understand them, cannot be close to them.</p>
<p>There is a point or complexity beyond which a business is no longer
manageable.</p>
<p>When top management has to depend totally on abstractions, such as
formal reports, fig- ures, and quantitative data, rather than be able to
see, know, and understand the business, its reality, its people, its
environment, its customers, its technology, then a business has become
too complex to be manageable. A business is manageable only if top
management is capable of testing against concrete reality the
measurements and information it receives, that is, its abstract figures,
data, and reports.</p>
<p>The information system can be as well designed as possible, as
complete as possible, and as much in “real time” as possible. Yet it
only answers questions which top manage- ment has already asked. It can
only report what had already had impact—that is, what is already
yesterday. For one can only codify the past. And every report is
codification.</p>
<p>The new developments that really matter are always by definition
outside any possible reporting system. By the time they show up in the
figures, it is very late—and may well be too late. Unless one
understands what is truly relevant, unless one has the ability to hold
the actual reality against one’s expectations, one will be overtaken by
events. One will become aware of problems only when they have become
“trouble.” One will see opportu- nities only when they have already been
missed.</p>
<p>Litton Industries in the United States was the pioneer of all the
post-World War II conglomerates. It was built and led by exceedingly
able men with wide industrial experi- ence, who had earlier built Hughes
Aircraft into leadership in military electronics. Litton</p>
<p>was the first of the conglomerates to preach the gospel of management
by “controls,” that is, by reports, data, and organized information. Yet
Litton was the first of the conglomer- ates to stub its toes, and to
prove the vulnerability of complexity and diversification. By the time
the Litton top management found out that its office equipment business
was in serious trouble, it was very late.</p>
<p>The Fallacy of “Asset Management”</p>
<p>The greatest fallacy of them all, but also the one that was most
popular in the heady days of the merger and acquisition boom of the
1960s, is the fallacy of “asset management.” There is such a business.
But it is strictly a financial one—it is, for instance, how Donaldson,
Lufkin, andandandand Jenrette have come to define their financial
business, which em- braces securities research, securities advice,
portfolio management, and mutual fund man- agement. There is also an
asset management function within each business. Every busi- ness needs
to make sure that assets are being managed and are being employed where
the results are. But asset management as it relates to non-financial
businesses is a function and not the definition of the business.</p>
<p>The asset managers who acquired operating businesses performed a
useful function when they closed down or sold off parts that were tying
down large chunks of assets with- out producing returns. But once they
had done this, they did not know what to do. They did not know how to
manage a business—and the boom of asset management ended in predictable
failure.</p>
<p>“Investor” vs. “Asset Manager”</p>
<p>There is indeed a way to do what the asset managers promised to do,
but it is long-term industrial investment rather than sleight-of-hand
asset management.</p>
<p>One example is the group built in England by Lord Cowdray around his
family firm of</p>
<p>S. Pearson andandandand Son. The Cowdray group holds interests in the
original business of the firm, construction. It controls Lazards, one of
London’s leading merchant banks. It controls newspapers and magazines,
such as the London Economist. Yet each of these businesses is managed
separately, by its own management team. Each has its own mission, its
own objectives, its own strategy—and its own results. Lord Cowdray and
his associates sit on the board of directors. They make sure that the
board does its own task; that is, that it reviews the basic plans and
strategies of each company and puts in a top-management team that is
doing its job and performs. But they do not “manage” the businesses.
Above all, they do not pretend that they own or manage one conglomerate
company. They are investors. Cowdray, for instance, identifies himself
in Who’s Who as an “investment company executive.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Friedrich Flick in Germany (died 1972) was an “investor,”
controlling Mer- cedes-Benz, Feldmuehle, a major paper and chemical
company, a large manufacturer of specialty machinery, and a steel
company. While Flick’s influence on these companies was great, he did
not manage them. He was a major outside investor and hard-working board
member.</p>
<p>The Mellons in Pittsburgh, similarly, have been large and influential
long-term inves- tors in a number of companies ranging from Gulf Oil to
the Aluminum Company of America, but never “managers.” And both the
Mellons and the “Mellon companies” have greatly benefited from the
relationship.</p>
<p>The investment company which looks for the right business to invest
in, takes a sub- stantial position in it, and then provides counsel and
effective hard-working board mem- bers is indeed a viable business of
its own. But it is a financial business.</p>
<p>Just as fallacious as the belief in asset management is the belief in
a “superman” who can do what other people cannot do, and who therefore
can somehow keep manageable a business that is in dozens—or, as in one
case, in several hundred—different fields, from insurance to
electronics—from rental cars to convenience foods—from computers to ho-
tels. Supermen may actually exist in the executive suite—though the
evidence is hardly</p>
<p>convincing. But despite everything their press agents say, even
supermen are mortal. And one cannot replace them once they are gone.
What only supermen can do is always un- sound; it cannot be
perpetuated.</p>
<p>Nothing succeeds like concentration on the right business. And if the
company is not in the right business, diversification will no more make
it a “growth company,” than a man with a broken hip will be restored to
health, by being taken on a twenty-mile forced march with an
eighty-pound pack on his shoulders.</p>
<p>Why Diversification?</p>
<p>All this should be fairly obvious. What, then, explains the
persistent allure of this manage- rial Lorelei, the quest for diversity
and complexity, and the worship of diversification?</p>
<p>The record provides a clue. For while the best-performing group of
businesses is al- ways found to comprise highly concentrated,
single-market, or single-technology compa- nies, the worst-performing
group also always includes a goodly number of such highly concentrated,
single-market, or single-technology companies. The railroads—since the
end of World War II if not since the end of World War I—belong here.</p>
<p>So do the “traditional materials” businesses—steel in the U.S. and
Western Europe, coal everywhere, copper and aluminum, and so on.*</p>
<p>There are internal as well as external reasons and pressures for
diversification. Man- agement needs to understand them, to be able to
manage them—and to manage such di- versification as might be needed in,
and indeed desirable for, a business.</p>
<p>First, the internal pressures:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One major pressure for diversification is psychological. People get
tired of doing the same things over and over again. They want to do
something different. Otherwise work becomes a bore.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a pharmaceutical business one hears again and again, “Our
customers, the physi- cians, are getting tired of the same drug. They
have been using it now for three years. They need something different.”
Judging by the prescriptions the physicians write for the drug, there is
no loss of interest. It is the salesmen who are getting tired of
repeating the same story again and again every time they call on a
physician. It is the salesmen who want “something different.”</p>
<p>This is not altogether frivolous. Indeed it is highly desirable that
any company remain flexible and practice doing something new and
different. Otherwise its capacity for change may atrophy. And when the
need for change arises, as it always does sooner or later, the company
will be unable to make even small and minor changes.</p>
<p>This is shown by the contrast between the two largest European
automobile compa- nies of the post-World War II period, Volkswagen and
Fiat. Volkswagen scored phe- nomenally with its “Beetle” for fifteen
years from 1950, when the company got going, until the late sixties:
Volkswagen knew, of course, of the ultimate collapse of Ford’s ear- lier
“universal car” of the World War I period, the Model T. Yet it kept the
“Beetle” un- changed until it showed fairly advanced symptoms of old age
in the late sixties. Then Volkswagen poured enormous amounts of money
into developing a multitude of new models. But not one of them has so
far proven successful in the market.</p>
<p>Fiat too had the “universal car” for the early stages of
automobilization in its famous Model 500, the Topolino. But Fiat, from
the beginning of the European automobile boom, systematically built up a
full product range from the low-price “universal car,” the almost
unchanged successor to the Topolino, to cars that extend well into the
medium-price range. For the ten or fifteen years during which the
“Beetle” enjoyed its phenomenal suc-</p>
<p>*A statistical study that relates diversification strategy to
business performance will be published shortly after the publication of
this book. Entitled Organizational Strategy: Analysis, Commitment,
Implementation (Irwin, 1975) and authored by Professor William Guth of
the Graduate Business School of New York University, it reports the
results of many years of work on diversification strategies and their
results. Guth’s analysis fully bears out the conclusions reached
independently by me and presented in this and the two subsequent
chapters. Guth’s analysis is to my knowledge, the first fully documented
study of this important subject.</p>
<p>cess, Fiat seemed in danger of being overtaken by Volkswagen. But
when the “Beetle” began to falter, Fiat forged ahead. All along it had
maintained its capacity to innovate and at the same time had given its
customers the choice of upgrading themselves to a bigger and better car
as their incomes and their appetites increased.</p>
<p>The advantages of concentration always carry with them the danger of
overspecializa- tion. Every product, every process, every technology,
every market eventually become old. The sales volume may still be there,
may indeed still go up. But the profitability dis-</p>
<p>appears. Then yesterday’s specialist is in danger of becoming
extinct.</p>
<p>Like any habit, the habit of doing the new and different has to be
kept alive by prac- tice. Otherwise the capacity for doing the different
will not be developed or—as in the case of the once highly innovative
textile industry—it will wither away. Diversification is not only a
psychological necessity. To keep one’s ability to diversify is an
economic sur-</p>
<p>vival need.</p>
<p>But care has to be taken lest this kind of diversification degenerate
into splintering.</p>
<p>The need to give the pharmaceutical company salesman something new to
talk about may easily degenerate into meaningless product proliferation
which then not only confuses the customer but annoys him. The product
proliferation in which a good many of the Ameri- can pharmaceutical
companies indulged for the sake of “doing something new” explains, in
large measure, why the U.S. medical fraternity has come to be so highly
critical of the drug companies.</p>
<p>The right rule was developed many, many years ago by the musician. An
accom- plished and well-established concert pianist will, as a matter of
course, add one new major piece to his repertoire each year. Every few
years he will pick for his new piece some- thing quite different from
the repertoire through which he has made his name. This forces him to
learn again, to hear new things in old and familiar pieces, and to
become a better pianist altogether. At the same time, concert pianists
have long known that they slough off an old piece as they add on one new
major one. The total size of the repertoire remains the same. There are
only so many pieces of music even the greatest pianist can play with
excellence.</p>
<p>How to apply this to a business has been demonstrated by the one
American pharma- ceutical company that has, for many years, followed a
systematic plan for research and for the introduction of drugs, Merck
andandandand Co.</p>
<p>Merck is as conscious as any other pharmaceutical company of the need
of salesmen to have “something new.” But it will not spend much time or
effort on the modification of existing products. It focuses its energies
on producing each year a small number of genu- inely new and different
drugs which represent a major improvement in the treatment of disease.
As a result, its salesmen really have something new to talk about. But
as a result also there is genuine diversification rather than mere
product proliferation. And Merck also then quietly withdraws effort and
support from older drugs which no longer have leadership. This strategy,
adopted in the late 1940s, has made Merck, which originally</p>
<p>was an insignificant and almost marginal distributor of patent
medicines, into the largest and most successful of American drug
manufacturers, and also into a most innovative one.</p>
<p>Backward and Forward Integration</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Another factor pressing for diversification has already been
discussed in a preceding chapter: being the wrong size. Diversification,
that is, extension of the business into new areas which balance the
vulnerabilities and weaknesses of one’s own wrong size, is not the only
remedy. But it is one of the remedies. And where it is appropriate, it
is the right remedy. Diversification in this situation becomes the best
strategy for a business.</li>
</ol>
<p>Closely related to the problem of the business that is the wrong size
is the need to in- tegrate either “backward” into earlier stages of the
economic chain, e.g., manufacturing for a distributor or mining for a
manufacturer; or integration “forward,” that is, toward the
marketplace.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck with 0 billion in sales is by far the largest American
retailer. But it is also one of the largest American manufacturers. More
than half of what Sears sells is made by manufacturers in which Sears
has an ownership stake, and sometimes even full ownership. This
“backward integration” of Sears is usually explained as a result of
Sears’s desire to “control” its sources of supply. But the more probable
answer might be that Sears found in the twenties and early thirties when
it first emerged as a retail giant, that suppliers would not commit
themselves to Sears unless assured of the permanence of the
relationship. For most Sears suppliers, and certainly for the successful
ones, Sears becomes rapidly their major customer, and their main, if not
eventually their sole, channel to the market. A supplier would be very
foolish if he did not insist on more assurance of a permanent
relationship than even a long-term contract provides. Without such
evidence of Sears’s commitment, he would, for instance, find it
difficult to obtain capital or credit from the outside. An intelligent
supplier would have balked at being tied to Sears unless Sears were also
tied to him. The major impetus to Sears’s backward integration was
surely that without it Sears was the “wrong size.”</p>
<p>The same largely applies to integration backward into raw materials.
The traditional explanation for backward integration is the fear of a
loss of supply. A manufacturer of petroleum products, of paper, or of
aluminum, integrates backward because he sees the danger of a shortage
in his basic material, i.e., crude oil, timber, or bauxite. But this ex-
planation is suspect. For such fears of scarcity have so far always been
disproved.</p>
<p>Successful backward integration creates a more profitable
business.</p>
<p>The oil refinery which has a substantial distribution system in the
form of gas stations, but which lacks crude oil reserves, may decide to
integrate backward and to acquire sup- plies of crude oil, because
otherwise it is the wrong size to be profitable. The profitable link in
the economic chain that leads from the oil well to the automobile’s gas
tank may be crude oil production. Or it may turn out that only the
combination of oil production and oil distribution is truly profitable;
each alone is a fragment rather than a business.</p>
<p>This, for instance, seems to have been the thinking that led one of
the large American marketers of petroleum products, Atlantic Refining,
into integration backward through merger with a crude oil producer who
in turn lacked refining and marketing capacity, the Richfield Oil
Company. Forward integration should be based on the same thinking. Cour-
taulds (see the preceding chapter), which solved its problem of being
the wrong size by forward integration into textile production, is a good
example.</p>
<p>Only integration—backward or forward—that remedies a problem of the
wrong size works out, as a rule. Integration is complexity. Even though
a company that integrates forward or backward stays in the same
industry, it moves into areas in which it has little or no previous
experience. It diversifies its activities. It requires new skills. It
assumes new risks. This is justified if it remedies gross disparity
between the cost and rewards of certain phases of the economic process
of which the company is a part. Decisions con- cerning integration
should therefore always start out with an understanding of cost struc-
ture and revenue streams for the entire economic process. That
combination of stages in the economic process which will give over the
long term the most favorable ratio between cost and revenues, and
between opportunities and risks, is the best integration balance for a
business.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Another internal pressure for diversification is the
understandable—and indeed un- derstandable—desire to convert an internal
cost center into a revenue producer.</li>
</ol>
<p>J. Lyons andandandand Company started out as caterers to an
exhibition held in London in the 1890s. The firm then branched out
rapidly into building popular chain-restaurants serving decent food at
low prices. By 1914, its “tea shops” had become a London landmark. It
then diversified further, still within the same market, into building
large restaurants, the famous Corner Houses; into building
popular-priced hotels; and into manufacturing food- stuffs first for its
own restaurants and hotels and then increasingly for the British con-
sumer. It became a major manufacturer of baked goods; of tea, and of ice
cream. In order to support these activities, Lyons very early had to
build its own laundry—laundry service for tea shops, restaurants, and
hotels could not be obtained on the outside in the quality</p>
<p>and, above all, in the quantity needed. And it had to develop its own
trucking fleet. For many years now these two ancillary businesses have
been run as profit-making businesses of their own, offering laundry and
trucking services to a wide variety of commercial aud industrial
customers.</p>
<p>But even a profitable business that is developed out of a cost center
should be kept only if it fits in. It should be kept only if it is
compatible with one’s own mission, and one’s own strategy, and if it
serves one’s own market or exploits one’s own technology. Otherwise it
leads to a diffusion of efforts.</p>
<p>Indeed it might be advisable to separate such a business developed
out of a cost center and to set it up independently, even though it does
fit into the overall frame. One example of this is offered by Heineken,
the leading Dutch brewery, which for reasons that closely paralleled
those underlying the Lyons diversification, went into financing and then
own- ing restaurants and cafés, then into investments in hotels and also
into trucking. Heineken, however, has put these outside interests, which
are not directly a part of the business of making and selling beverages,
into a separate investment company which Heineken owns but which
Heineken does not manage.</p>
<p>External Pressures</p>
<p>More important and more pervasive are a number of external pressures
toward diversity.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is first the pressure of an economy which is so small and
confined that the in- dividual business cannot grow beyond small size.
At the same time, the economy is so small that an individual management
can know it in all its facets and dimensions. At that stage in the
development of an economy, technology is likely to be available from the
outside; the market is still too small to appear promising to major
companies elsewhere. Capital at this stage of development is likely also
to have to come from the outside. And the foreign investor tends to
prefer working with people who have already established themselves in
the market and have proven their entrepreneurial and managerial compe-
tence. Under these circumstances business growth will tend to become
growth through diversification.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is indeed a major stage in economic development.</p>
<p>Belgium, which in the early nineteenth century was the most highly
industrialized of all countries on the European continent, became the
prototype. The pattern then estab- lished has persisted until now: one
entrepreneurial and managerial group diversifies into a substantial
number of different industries, all producing for the same limited
national market. This same pattern was then repeated half a century
later in the industrialization of Japan. Three or four Zaibatsu groups
were the managerial foci. Their ability to obtain technology from abroad
enabled them to go into a large number of different industries, each of
them for a long time quite small and producing for what, until well into
this cen- tury, was a limited home market. In Brazil the same pattern
emerged when industrializa- tion started after World War I. The
Mattarazzos, for instance, began around World War I with a noodle
factory—perhaps the first industrial business in Brazil that was purely
do- mestic rather than a branch of a foreign company. Thirty years
later, by the early 1950s, the Mattarazzos controlled a vast industrial
empire composed of fairly small companies in a variety of businesses.
India still exhibits very much the same pattern with the two busi- ness
empires of Tata and Birla, both engaged in a large number of quite
different busi- nesses. The same pattern of the one management group
engaged in a large number of businesses within a small market
characterizes industry in such countries as Peru and Venezuela
today.</p>
<p>But the same pattern also ruled California until World War II even
though politically California had of course long been part of a
continental economy, that of the United States. Yet until World War II,
geography and distance provided a measure of isolation which made
California in many ways a protected and at the same time a small
market.</p>
<p>In many cases of economic development the diversified company in the
small econ- omy may indeed be the best pattern. It is, however, not an
“inevitable stage” in develop-</p>
<p>ment. Neither Switzerland nor Holland—both at that stage poorer and
less populous than Belgium—followed it. Both overcame the limitations of
their home market by early ex- pansion abroad.</p>
<p>And diversification within the confined economy should always be
considered a tran- sitory place.</p>
<p>Many of the Californian businesses that were started, mostly after
World War I, to supply a limited West Coast market—and which were often
based on technology bought or licensed from the big companies of the
East and Middle West—have by now grown into national businesses, some of
them (e.g., Avery Products, a leader in adhesive labels and other paper
products) into very sizable businesses. Others went “national” by
merging with companies from the East. The other “regionals” have either
disappeared or shrunk into insignificance.</p>
<p>For diversification within the small and confined economy becomes the
wrong pattern when the market grows. Japan had outgrown the pattern even
before the American Occu- pation dissolved the Zaibatsu. Brazil has
outgrown it since the end of World War II. The dominant Brazilian
businesses of today are highly concentrated, e.g., Volkswagen do Brazil
or Sanbra, the leading Brazilian producer of edible oil products.</p>
<p>Where the pattern is not being sloughed off as an economy develops it
is likely to be- come a straightjacket, stunting growth, both of the
economy and of the economy’s busi- nesses. The pattern of
diversification within the small market which served Belgium so well in
Victorian days was clearly one of the reasons for the stagnation of the
country in this century and for its difficulty in generating new growth
businesses.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Quite different is business diversification based on market
expansion. The most visible and most important example today is the
multinational company. It will be dis- cussed in Chapter 59.</p></li>
<li><p>Equally important as a force pushing business toward
diversification is technology, Technology by its very nature tends to
branch. What starts out as a technology for one product, product line,
or market soon becomes a whole family of technologies generating a
multitude of different products for a great number of different
markets.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Both the electrical and the chemical industries were founded in the
third quarter of the nineteenth century on two or three processes
leading to two or three products for two or three markets. The
electrical industry was based on the dynamo and on the electric light
bulb, to which shortly thereafter the electric streetcar was added. The
modern chemical industry has three roots: explosives for mining and
railroad building; chlorine, largely for the paper and textile
industries; and dyestuffs for the textile industry.</p>
<p>Within twenty-five years these technologies branched out into a
multitude of different products and product lines for different markets.
By 1900, General Electric and Siemens, Hoechst in Germany and Brunner
Mond (one of the forerunners of Britain’s Imperial Chemical Industries),
had already become conglomerates in the fullest meaning of the word. By
now the major electric-apparatus and chemical companies are the most
con- glomerate of all the conglomerates, exceeding even an ITT in the
number of different businesses, different processes, different product
lines, and different markets they are engaged in.</p>
<p>This diversification was not planned: it grew out of what happened in
a test tube in the laboratory or on the drawing board of a machine
designer. Technology begat new tech- nology—and business diversification
then followed.</p>
<p>These dynamics of technology are at work not only in material, i.e.,
“technical” areas, but equally in social technology and services.</p>
<p>Today’s American commercial bank is truly a conglomerate in the
services it offers. It is diversified perhaps beyond easy manageability.
Yet each of the services developed out of the others. Each developed as
a result of a new capacity to provide a financial service fashioned out
of existing knowledge, to meet a new need of an old customer, or to make
old services suitable for new customers.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Another extraneous factor, and one that is rarely taken into account
by economists, is the thrust of modern tax legislation.</li>
</ol>
<p>In practically every developed country the tax laws put a high
premium on a com- pany’s reinvesting capital in its business rather than
paying it back to the investors. Capi- tal paid out is not considered
repayment but a distribution of profits and taxed accord- ingly. It is
therefore far more economical for the investors—and for the company as
well—to diversify with capital that is no longer needed in a company’s
original business.</p>
<p>A perfect example is the origin of the diversification which
converted W. R. Grace andandandand Co. from a fairly small business
engaged in shipping, trade, and a little manufacturing in the small
countries along South America’s west coast into one of the major
chemical companies of the United States.</p>
<p>Latin America has traditionally found itself with a tremendous cash
surplus whenever there is war in Europe. The raw materials and
foodstuffs which Latin America produces then command very high prices,
while the money earned cannot be spent on manufactured goods from the
developed countries. W. R. Grace found itself therefore with cash on its
hands at the end of World War II. Diversification was the only way to
keep the money out of the clutches of the tax collector.</p>
<p>This is probably an extreme case. But on a smaller scale the same tax
considerations underlie a great many diversification moves, especially
of older companies in stable or declining industries where investment of
excess funds in the existing business would make little or no sense.</p>
<p>The tax laws of the developed countries which, in one way or another,
penalize the re- turn of excess capital to the investors—the American
tax laws, for instance, allow this only if the whole business is being
liquidated—are a powerful engine of diversification. That GM did not
spin off Chevrolet is in some degree also the fault of the tax system.
The tax laws were not, of course, designed for that purpose. On the
contrary. But altogether the effect of present day tax laws on
industrial concentration, on the emergence of con- glomerates, and on
bigness has been in every country almost the exact opposite of what tax
policy professes to believe in and to work for.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Finally as the last major pressure toward diversification there is
the emergence of what I call the “new markets,” the markets for
investment and capital as a “mass market,” and the emergence of the
market for jobs and careers as another mass market (on this see the
essay, “The New Markets and the New Entrepreneurs,” in my book, Men,
Ideas and Politics.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mass-market investor—and he is quite different from the old-style
capitalist is also a “customer.” The “product” that is value for him in
terms of a company’s securities must fit his expectations. Similarly the
young educated people today are customers in the mass market for jobs
and careers. And the “product,” that is the jobs and career opportu-
nities which an employer offers, also have to fit their expectations and
be “value” to them. And both of the new mass markets put high value on
diversification. Indeed, the growth of the conglomerate, and the
take-over fever of the late sixties, were in large measure first
responses to the demands and expectations of these new mass markets. As
first responses to new problems usually are, they were the wrong
responses. But the demands of these new mass markets will remain and
will have to be satisfied. And both, in large measure, will be satisfied
only by diversification.</p>
<p>Diversification, in fine, is a complex phenomenon. No matter how
preferable the pu- rity of concentration may be, all businesses need to
think through whether they need to diversify and how.</p>
<p>Some of the pressures that make for diversification may be
opportunities for a com- pany. Others are threats. Some, such as the tax
laws, reward the wrong and punish the right behavior. In some stages of
a company’s development, diversification, in other words, may be a
necessity. In others it may be highly desirable. In others yet, it may
be a temptation that should be sternly resisted.</p>
<p>Right and Wrong Diversification</p>
<p>The record shows clearly that there is right diversification and
there is wrong diversifica- tion.* The right diversification produces
businesses whose performance capacity almost equals that of the top
performers among highly concentrated, single-market or single-
technology companies. Wrong diversification produces businesses
performing as poorly as a single-market or single-technology firm that
is highly concentrated in the wrong business. And the difference is
always that the performing diversified company has a common core of
unity to its business or businesses.</p>
<p>This, however, implies that diversification is not something that can
be either con- demned or recommended as such. It is therefore a major
task of top management to de- cide what diversification and how much a
particular company needs to make the most of its strengths and to get
the best results from its resources.</p>
<p>One starting point must be the question “What is the least
diversification this business needs to accomplish its mission, obtain
its objectives, and continue to be viable and pros- perous?” But at the
same time the question “What is the most diversification we can man-
age, the most complexity this business can bear?” should also be asked.
The optimum will lie, as a rule, between the two extremes. The closer it
can come to the minimum needed, the more easily manageable will the
business be. The burden of proof always lies on those who want more
diversification rather than on those who want more concentration.</p>
<p>No matter how desirable concentration is, it may have to be
harmonized with diversi- fication. Otherwise it could become
overspecialization. But no matter how desirable—or indeed
inescapable—diversification is, it has to make possible concentration.
Otherwise it becomes splintering and diffusion. Simplicity and
complexity are both genuine needs. They pull the business in opposite
directions. Yet they must not be allowed to become conflicts. They must
instead be synthesized. To manage diversity by embedding it in a common
core of unity is a top-management task—and equally pressing in the
small, the fair-sized, and the big business.</p>

<p>within the unity of a common market. And a business can be highly
diversified and have fundamental unity if its businesses, its markets,
its products and product lines, and its ac- tivities are held together
in a common technology. Both a common market and a common technology
provide the first requirement for unity: a common language throughout
the entire organization. They make possible mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Of the two, unification in and through the market is more likely to
be successful.</p>
<p>Pepsi-Cola stayed in its own market when it bought Fritolay; a
manufacturer of snack foods—for a bottled soft drink is, of course, also
a “snack.” And Coca-Cola stayed within its market when it bought Minute
Maid, the pioneer of frozen orange juice. Unilever and Nestle, the two
giant multinationals of the European consumer goods industry; are in
many phases of packaged and processed products in a large number of
countries. But for all their products, the customer is the grocery store
or the supermarket. Similarly, Procter andandandand Gamble stayed within
its market when it bought a large regional coffee blender. Mich- elin,
the world’s oldest rubber tire manufacturer and, in fact, the pioneer in
pneumatic tires of the 1890s, diversified within the same market, the
automobilist, when it went into travel guides.</p>
<p>Provided there is true unity in the market, technology can be very
diverse indeed and yet not lead to the kind of diversification that is
splintering and complex.</p>
<p>One major pharmaceutical company has successfully added a chain of
medical labora- tories and a line of advanced diagnostic instruments to
its business. The technologies are totally different. But the customers
are the same—the practicing physicians who are in private practice or on
a hospital staff. They consider very much the same things “value” with
respect to prescription drugs, to medical tests, and to instruments.</p>
<p>There are two caveats to diversification within market unity. First,
the customer de- cides what the market is rather than the manufacturer.
It is not enough that a diversifica- tion appears to the manufacturer to
constitute another approach to the same and familiar</p>
<p>market. The customer must also see the new diversification as part of
the same market. Otherwise there is high risk of failure.</p>
<p>RCA, in the late 1940s, was probably the leading brand in the United
Slates for radios and phonographs. From the point of view of
manufacturing industry, these are “appli- ances.” It therefore must have
seemed logical to RCA to diversify into the rapidly grow- ing market for
kitchen appliances such as ranges and refrigerators. RCA clearly had the
engineering competence. It also had the distribution network. Yet RCA,
despite its re- sources, and despite the acknowledged high quality of
its products, did not succeed in the kitchen business. To the customer,
the housewife, the kitchen and the living room are different. Living
room appliances are not appliances. They are “furniture.” RCA’s famous
trademark did not, as the company confidently expected, create customer
acceptance. After a few years of struggle, RCA was forced to sell its
kitchen appliance business to an appliance manufacturer whose trademark
was established in the kitchen market, the Whirlpool Corporation, which
had long been supplying refrigerators and ranges to Sears, Roebuck.</p>
<p>This holds true for services as well as goods. And it holds true in
industrial markets too. Despite the prestige of General Electric as a
manufacturer of advanced electrical and electronic equipment, the buyers
of computers did not accept GE as a “superior” com- puter maker. The GE
computers were technically fully competitive. Yet GE could not establish
itself in the computer business and finally gave up.</p>
<p>Technical expertise is altogether unlikely to lead to a correct
definition of a “common market.” It is far more likely to work as the
foundation of unity for diversification into different markets.</p>
<p>For the customer is very likely not to consider as one market what to
the manufacturer or supplier appear as closely related products. He is
also quite likely to aggregate as one market what to the manufacturer or
supplier are clearly very different products or ser- vices, and even
quite different end uses and end users.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck carries, as do, of course, many retailers, a
staggering number of dif- ferent products in its stores and catalogs. It
also has developed a successful casualty in- surance company which has
become a leader in the competitive automobile insurance field. It has
launched a mutual fund. It has the largest chain of automotive repair
centers. And it has, at various times, organized book clubs and travel
services. What all these have in common is that these goods and services
are being bought by the American middle- class family and as part of its
normal “budget.” They fit into Sears’s definition of its busi- ness as
buyer for the American family. Technically there is a world of
difference between automobile insurance. But the same customer buys
them, very much the same way, and with the same value expectations.</p>
<p>The basic risk of the market definition is implied in these examples.
Foresight and analysis are highly unreliable tools to define a common
market. It is not easy to predict whether a given product or service
will actually fit into one’s market or not. It is not even easily
determined by market research. Only in the blinding light of hindsight
is it always obvious why this or that product that seemed such a perfect
fit did not succeed in what “should have been” its market.</p>
<p>No amount of market or consumer research, it is safe to say, would
have brought out the fact that the American housewife does not consider
kitchen appliances and living room radios part of the same product
category. After all, several companies were at that time successful in
both markets, e.g., General Electric, GM, and Westinghouse. And Sears
too had established itself successfully in both. After the RCA debacle
the reason for it became crystal clear. But by then it was too late.</p>
<p>The Need for a Business Strategy</p>
<p>The second caveat is that unity of the market will work on a basis of
diversification only if there is a true business strategy. It will not
work if diversification is mere aggregation.</p>
<p>A strategy always defines both what to include within the definition
of one’s business and what to exclude. One of the earliest and most
successful diversification policies based on market unity was the
“transportation company” which the Canadian Pacific Railroad built in
the early years of this century. Canadian Pacific built, on its railroad
foundation, a sizable chain of hotels across Canada and a large
steamship company operating both on the Atlantic and the Pacific (to
which was added, after World War II, a fair-sized interna- tional
airline). But the market that gave unity to CP’s businesses was not
transportation. It was the passenger. While the railroad, of course,
carried goods as well as people, the di- versification strategy focused
on the traveling public.</p>
<p>A diversification strategy should include a plan which defines the
role of each busi- ness within the entire enterprise. Diversification
strategy—like any other strategy—must serve as the basis for specific
goals, specific targets, specific assignments to specific busi-
nesses.</p>
<p>Diversification strategy explains the success of General Motors after
it had been reor- ganized—and in effect re-founded—around market unity
by Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., in the early 1920s. The GM which Sloan
inherited was diversified on the basis of market unity but without any
strategy. It included half a dozen automobile businesses, each with its
own nameplate, its own engineering, its own policies, and its own
distribution network, but none with clear mission or identity. It had
been built by financial acquisitions and was essentially a conglomerate
even though its businesses were all primarily automotive. What made GM
effective is that Sloan revamped this structure on the basis of a
system- atic strategy. Despite tremendous opposition from within, he
took the grave risk of mov- ing an established nameplate, Oldsmobile,
out of its market segment and into a new and more logical one. He
completely changed the basic policy of Chevrolet and focused it on the
market which Chevrolet had been trying to avoid till then: the mass
market where Ford seemed to hold an impregnable position. He replaced
Oakland with an entirely new nameplate, Pontiac, to which he gave, from
the beginning, a clear position in the market and a clear strategy.</p>
<p>In contrast to Sloan, the men who merged the bulk of the
British-owned automobile companies into British Leyland Motors in the
sixties have kept a miscellany of name- plates, some with a clear market
of their own, some without much identity or personality. They went
apparently much further than Sloan did in internal rationalization of
manufac- turing facilities, interchangeability of parts and processes,
and effective cost control— things General Motors tackled only much
later. But they did not, as far as an outsider can discern, develop a
business strategy for a unified business, or a market strategy based
thereon.</p>
<p>General Motors emerged as the leader in the American automobile
industry within two or three years after Sloan’s reorganization. British
Leyland, five years after the merger that created it, had not
significantly improved its market position or its performance. It had
remained a conglomerate.</p>
<p>Each business within a diversified company, indeed each product line
and each distri- bution channel, needs its own plans, goals, and
strategies. Each needs to set clear objec- tives and to measure results
against expectations. Each needs, in other words, to be man- aged as an
autonomous business. But, at the same time, to obtain the results of
diversifica- tion, there has to be a unified strategy, an overall
design, a common mission for the entire business. There has to be
diversity in unity. Otherwise even a common market will not provide
unity. A common market makes unity possible. It is management that makes
it reality.</p>
<p>Technology as a Common Core of Unity</p>
<p>The second axis of successful diversification is technology. A common
technology can be used as the foundation for diversification into a
substantial number of quite different mar- kets.</p>
<p>It seems to be more difficult to build market diversification on
common technology than it is to build technological diversification on
market unity. Psychologically, the man- ager is likely to be respectful
of, and attentive to, different demands of different technolo- gies.
They are “rational.” But that different markets behave differently he is
far more likely to resist—indeed, to resent—as “irrational.” Expertise
in technology is readily iden- tified. It can be acquired
systematically, though not always in a “course.” Expertise in a market
is experience. It is “feel” rather than “fact.” It is understanding
rather than infor- mation.</p>
<p>For one major group of industries, technology-based diversification
is the only way to conduct their business. These are the materials or
process industries: steel, glass, alumi- num, paper, and copper. They
are “process-determined.” The only thing that can come out of a glass
kiln is glass. Yet these products go into every conceivable market.</p>
<p>The experience of the materials industries shows that
technology-based diversification is not easy. By and large these
industries have performed indifferently, at least since World War II—and
some have been among the poorest performers. They have al1 put great
emphasis on “marketing.” Many (as pointed out earlier in Chapter 46)
have used the design principle of simulated decentralization to create
near-autonomous units for specific markets. But they have found this no
royal road to success.</p>
<p>The materials industries were the leaders in nineteenth-century
industrial develop- ment. In terms of volume—let alone of capital
investment—they are still growing vigor- ously. But their products have
become “commodities,” earning not much more than their costs. The cause
is clearly the built-in diversity in the market which their technology
im- poses on them. The one exception seems to be petroleum. But
petroleum is the one mate- rials industry with market concentration. The
great bulk of the industry’s output are fuels for a very small number of
end uses: gasoline and diesel fuel for motor vehicles on land, sea, and
air, and fuel for power plants. Economically the petroleum industry is a
“market- ing industry” that has integrated backward into raw material
supply.</p>
<p>Even among the genuine materials companies, a few have done very
well. They ex- emplify both what can be done and how to do it.</p>
<p>An outstanding example may, well be an American glass manufacturer,
Corning Glass Works. Corning Glass is in a multitude of markets, from
special glasses for the most ad- vanced scientific uses, to tableware
for the mass market sold through hardware stores and supermarkets, to
receiving tubes for television sets and many others—all based on one
common technology: glassmaking.</p>
<p>With 00 million in sales in 197l and some 30,000 employees, Corning
is still a fairly small company compared to the materials giants of
petroleum, steel, and copper. But it is a very large company in its own
materials field. And it is both far more profitable and has shown far
faster growth than the great majority of materials businesses.</p>
<p>Outside of the materials field there are also examples of successful
technology-based diversification. Tateisi Electronics in Kyoto is not as
well known in the West as Sony but is in its own way as successful. The
company grew as a maker of industrial equipment such as control
instruments and switches. It built first on licenses from foreign, and
mostly from American, electronic companies. It then developed its own
technological competence in the electronics field. It has successfully
diversified into medical technol- ogy, first into the design and
production of highly sophisticated diagnostic tools, and then into the
design and production of electronically controlled artificial limbs. It
also has moved into the office equipment market with a line of desk
calculators, and so on. The markets for its products are diverse. The
technology is common.</p>
<p>“Technology” does not necessarily mean “science and engineering.”
Techne, the Greek word from which “technology” derives, means, after
all, “useful knowledge,” or “organized skill,” rather than
“engineering.”</p>
<p>The bank credit card, such as BankAmericard, was not “invented” by
the commercial banks and is surely not science or engineering. But it
required learning new and difficult skills. It represents genuine
diversification based on new techne.</p>
<p>A common technology provides a common language. It provides a
competitive edge.</p>
<p>It gives advantage in the marketplace. And it makes possible
diversification which does not splinter a business but unites it.</p>
<p>Some Basic Rules</p>
<p>Technology-based diversification, to be successful, requires
observance of same basic rules.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The technology must be specific. It must be a “skill,” a techne,
rather than a theory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clichés such as communications or transportation are not a common
technology. The large broadcasting chains in the U.S. are undoubtedly in
communications. They have not covered themselves with glory in managing
book publishers. Nor, one suspects, would they do well publishing trade
magazines. The large American university floundered mis- erably when it
took on government contracts in urban and social problems, or in
interna- tional development, as an extension of its competence in
“knowledge” and in “teaching.”</p>
<p>Academic disciplines are not a “common technology,” if only because
they are theory- focused rather than skill-focused. Nor is competence in
“problem solving.” One can build a successful practice on problem
solving, e.g., as a consultant in operations research who applies his
tools to the problems of a client. One cannot say, “We know how to solve
problems and therefore can make or market any product or science where
‘problems’ ex- ist.”</p>
<p>Most managements tend to define “market” too narrowly. They tend to
see it as “the market for what we make” rather than as “the value the
customer pays for.” But many managements tend to define “technology”
much too broadly. They think it means “what we can intellectually
grasp.” What it really means is “what we can do with great skill and
high distinction.”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The technology must be distinct. It must be able to endow a
company’s product with leadership characteristics.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is observance of this rule which explains why Corning Glass has
high performance while so many other materials companies produce
undifferentiated commodities and show only mediocre results. Corning has
stayed away from ordinary glass tableware, even though it has both the
technical and the productive capacity to make it. But in glass ta-
bleware there are no requirements above the ordinary glass technology.
The tableware and kitchenware which Corning makes and sells are based on
advanced or proprietary technology, such as making glass heat-resisting
or chip-proof. And when Corning went into an area of glass exploitation
in which the premium was on design and artistry rather than on glass
technology; that is, when it decided to go into the production of
specially designed and hand-blown art objects made from glass but meant
for collection rather than for use, it set this up as a completely
separate business, under its own name, Steuben Glass, with its own
management and its own marketing. Steuben has been highly success-
ful—but it is not managed as a part of Corning Glass, even though it is
wholly owned.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The technology in which a company has distinction must be central
rather than in- cidental to the product or service into which a company
diversifies. To disregard this rule invites frustration.</li>
</ol>
<p>The bank credit card seemed a logical extension of “retail banking.”
Yet it turned out that the major skills of the commercial banker were
only incidental to the credit card business. New and very different
skills are required—mail selling, for instance, which has a highly
specialized technology, and credit control. As a result, the banks did
not do well for a long time. They signed up the customers all right—but
then lost their shirts. The Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, which had
pioneered the bank credit card, aban- doned the field after a few
disastrous years, as did the major banks in Chicago. The Bank of
America, which took over when the Chase gave up, then spent five years
or more to learn the new skills.</p>
<p>The American paper industry presents good examples of both the right
way and the wrong—or at least, unduly risky—way of using technology as a
base for diversification.</p>
<p>A few, mostly medium-sized, companies extended the standard and
well-known technol- ogy of papermaking into new consumer markets, making
and selling, for instance, facial tissues. They were highly successful
(though a non-papermaker, Procter andandandand Gamble, has been equally
successful in parts of this field, e.g., disposable diapers, where it
used its knowledge of consumer marketing to diversify in technology and
product beyond its original oil, soap, and fat-based business).</p>
<p>By contrast, many, especially the very large, paper companies have
unsuccessfully spent millions of dollars and years of effort on
establishing themselves in the market for “technical” papers—paper for
photographic or inkless reproduction; heat-conducting or heat-reactive
paper; light reactive or electricity-conducting paper, and many others.
They were right in their assumptions: the market for technical paper has
been growing very fast and has high profit potential. But the paper
companies, it turned out, were wrong in their belief that paper
technology is a central element in making technical paper. The central
technologies are surface physics and surface chemistry; the paper is
merely a—rather in- cidental—carrier.</p>
<p>The paper industry example—but also the bank credit card—shows that
it is not easy to predict whether a given technology will be central to
a new market or a new product line or service. It may indeed be even
more difficult to predict the applicability of tech- nology than to
predict whether a given new product or service will fit into one’s old
mar- ket and market understanding.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Finally, technological-based diversification needs basic strategy as
much as does market-based diversification. And the strategy is more
complex and more difficult.</li>
</ol>
<p>The examples given so far of technology-based diversification all
dealt with new and additional products, services, or businesses. But
technology can be productively exploited in a number of ways of which
doing it oneself is only one. “What is the best way to ex- ploit our
technology” should always be asked in considering diversification of
one’s techne.</p>
<p>One of the leading pharmaceutical companies has a firm rule. Whenever
research comes up with a new development that seems to have high
promise, top management sits down with the research and marketing people
and asks, “For which of our competitors would this be an ideal
development? Into whose product line, whose market, whose ex- pertise
would this development fit the best, provided it really works out?” “We
do not ask this question,” says one of the firm’s senior executives,
“because we prefer to sell a de- velopment, least of all to a
competitor. We ask this question in the first place to force our- selves
to think through what the development will require from us to live up to
its prom- ise, what strategy we should work out, what resources will be
needed, and what we can eventually expect. But in almost half the cases,
this question has led us not to go ahead, ourselves and alone.</p>
<p>“Occasionally, as a result of this question, we have decided to
abandon what at first seemed to be a highly promising development. It
turned out not to be so promising after all. Instead of a major new
addition to the physicians’ arsenal of disease-fighting drugs, it would
have been a nice scientific curiosity, with little therapeutic
differentiation. But more often, we have come to the conclusion that the
development, while indeed highly promising, is not for us. It may be a
development that, if successfully carried to conclu- sion, will result
in a drug with significant disease-fighting properties, but for a very
nar- row range of diseases or for a very limited segment of the medical
practice. Then the drug fits better into the product line of a small
company which specializes in the area, a com- pany for which this drug
is really a major product, where for us it would be a complica- tion
requiring marketing efforts that lie essentially outside our business
and our market. In other cases, while the development seemed to lead to
a product line with substantial sales potential, we still sometimes have
come to the conclusion that we might as well license it, and either
become one company among many that produce the product or let others do
it altogether. We have done this, for instance, with a few drugs mainly
applicable to tropical diseases where we have very little marketing
strength. We have licensed developments where the end result was likely
to be a single drug in a market, e.g., pain-killers, in which</p>
<p>we have no other drugs in the line so that we would have had to mount
a major marketing effort to sell just one drug where the physician needs
half a dozen to choose from.</p>
<p>“In a few cases, we decided to use the development to build on it a
joint venture with other companies, usually with chemical companies
which have production expertise which was needed for this particular
drug category and which we do not possess. I cannot recall a single case
where we abandoned, sold, licensed, or joint-ventured a development we
should have held on to. If we made a mistake, it is by holding on to too
many of our own developments, by being too reluctant to accept the fact
that the development of our own research, no matter how exciting and
promising, could still not be the right thing for us, or that we could
not be the right company to do the development and marketing job.”</p>
<p>Yet, this company is known above all for the breadth of its product
line and for its leadership position, domestic as well as international,
in the major end-use markets of the pharmaceutical industry. For its
policy has enabled it to focus on the developments of major
significance. It has, at the same time, enabled it to derive maximum
benefit from its technological resources. It derives almost one-third of
its income from drugs and chemi- cals that it pioneered but does not
make itself, but has sold, licensed, or joint-ventured.</p>
<p>Another strategy requirement is to identify and define what
additional or new technol- ogy is needed to put existing technology into
new products, services, or markets.</p>
<p>This was the question the large American commercial banks did not ask
when they originally went into bank credit cards. They saw the skills
that “fitted,” but not the ones they lacked. And a corollary is the
question “And what old technology do we need to abandon or play down
because it does not fit the new products, services, or markets?”</p>
<p>A small company had for many years based its business of blending and
marketing grass seed throughout the U.S. on highly developed technical
competence in testing soils and supplying a custom-blended seed mixture
based on the test. When it decided to diver- sify into “lawn-care
products”—that is, into fertilizers, weed controls, pesticides, and her-
bicides based on its knowledge of the techne of lawn making and lawn
maintenance—it decided that it had to abandon the very expertise on
which its earlier business had largely been based: the expertise in soil
testing. To make its fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides truly
distinctive and effective they had to be able to produce good results
with any seed package bearing the company’s label. And this, of course,
meant uniform seed blends, at least for major climatic zones. This
entailed major work on developing and testing new seed blends. It also
was a highly risky thing to do. Yet it explains, in large measure, the
success of the company’s fertilizers and weed controls which, within a
decade, made it into a fair-sized business and gave it leadership
position in a market many times as large as its original seed
market.</p>
<p>Finally, technology-based diversification often requires new
marketing knowledge and new marketing strategy.</p>
<p>GM succeeded in diversifying into diesel locomotives because it
recognized this. It failed in aircraft engines because it did not
recognize this. Its Electromotive Division was based or a technological
development: the re-engineering of the diesel engine. But it suc-
ceeded—to the point of having a virtual monopoly position in the
market—because of a clear recognition that the railroads were a very
different market and required hard, consis- tent work and new marketing
strategies. GM also acquired a small aircraft engine maker, Allison, as
a vehicle for technology-based diversification. Despite substantial
technologi- cal achievements, at least in the early years before the jet
engine, Allison has never amounted to much. It took for granted that the
aircraft market was not much different from the markets GM knows,
understands, and is active in.</p>
<p>The “Extended Technological Family”</p>
<p>The most challenging problem in technology-based diversification is
what one might call “the extended technological family”: the business
that is being pushed into diversification through the inherent dynamics
of technology and its tendency to “branch.” In their origin,</p>
<p>these businesses have a common technological ancestor: electricity or
chemistry. But then technology “branched.”</p>
<p>The electrical giants of today, Siemens and AEG in Germany, the
American and Brit- ish General Electric Companies, Westinghouse,
Philips, and Hitachi, all grew out of what was a hundred years ago, the
common technology of “electricity.” But step by step they have
diversified into an almost infinite number of different businesses with
different mar- kets, from nuclear generators to toasters. All of them
have something to do with electric- ity. But in many of them,
electricity is a minor rather than the essential factor.</p>
<p>Similarly, the chemical giants grew out of what a century ago was a
unified discipline and, step by step, branched into a multitude of
different technologies, processes, and mar- kets. The ancestors of I.G.
Farben in Germany, Du Pont, Monsanto, and Union Carbide in the United
States, and Imperial Chemical in England all grew out of narrow
technologies. The descendants are in scores of markets and in as many
technologies: in industrial prod- ucts and consumer goods, in textile
fibers and in explosives, in dyestuffs, in pharmaceuti- cals, and in
food additives.</p>
<p>Are these “natural conglomerates” viable? Are they manageable? Are
they optimal? A short time ago such questions would have seemed
preposterous. These technology-linked natural conglomerates were so
clearly the major success stories of the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. But while they still dominate the industrial landscape these
ex- tended technological families no longer possess the clear advantages
they seemed to enjoy not so long ago. All around them there are
businesses which, concentrating on one field within these extended
technologies, are doing very well indeed and are, in many cases,
steadily increasing their market shares.</p>
<p>It is perhaps even more ominous that the major innovations within
their own technol- ogy, no longer seem to come from these giants—even
though they are the companies with the large research labs and lavish
research budgets. Pharmaceutical sales of U.S. compa- nies grew from 00
million in 1945 to some billion in 1970—most of it in products that did
not exist in 1945. Practically none of these products were developed by
the chemical giants, whether American or European. It is not GE or RCA
who have the com- puter but companies that started small and were
innocent of electronic technology such as IBM, Remington Rand (Univac),
an old typewriter manufacturer, or Honeywell, which had grown as a
manufacturer of switches and simple controls. Even in electronics, the
most successful firms are specialists such as Texas Instruments or Sony,
which make a very small corner of the electronics technology their
province rather than attempt to di- versify into all the possible
businesses in which electronics play a role.</p>
<p>It may well be that the extended technological family is becoming
outmoded as a business strategy. It may represent a transition phase in
the development of a technology similar to that of diversification into
many different businesses within a small, confined economy discussed in
the preceding chapter. In the early stages of a new major technol- ogy
there is sometimes not enough scope for the full exploitation of new
knowledge and skill within one area or a few areas. Simultaneous
development into many areas to which the new technology applies is
optimal. Beyond a certain stage—characterized as much by the size of the
markets at by the proliferation or branching of the technology into many
directions— “electricity” or “chemistry” or “electronics” ceases to
provide a “common technology.” But so probably do “banking” or
“retailing.” Beyond this stage diversifica- tion becomes splintering and
counterproductive.</p>
<p>That this might be the case is indicated by the fact that most of
these giant extended technological families have a few areas in which
they have strength and maintain their leadership position: GE and
Westinghouse in heavy electrical apparatus, Philips in con- sumer
electronics, Union Carbide in metallurgical chemistry, Du Pont in
textile fibers and so on. In these areas they also maintain their
innovative capacity. The reason for the rela- tive sluggishness and
vulnerability of these companies is not “poor management” but “spotty
management.” It is not that they are in too few “good” businesses but
that they are in too many that do not “fit.”</p>
<p>Only the General Electric Company among the major extended
technological families seems so far to have faced up to these questions.
At least GE in the sixties and early sev- enties quietly went out of a
number of businesses—in the consumer goods as well as the industrial
products areas—in which electricity had become an incidental, rather
than an essential factor.</p>
<p>The extended technological family is at the limit of manageable
diversification. What holds it together is common history rather than
common task.</p>
<p>What Does Not Work</p>
<p>Attempts to diversify, without either a foundation in common market
or in common tech- nology are doomed to frustration. They result
essentially in unmanageable businesses; that is, in businesses that do
well in fair weather but flounder when the wind starts blowing.</p>
<p>The most nearly manageable of these is the business that diversifies
simultaneously along both axes—that of market and that of
technology.</p>
<p>One of the leading multinational companies started out a century ago
with a process to extract starch from corn (maize). Out of this basis of
a common technology, it grew stead- ily into industrial products such as
adhesives, glues, and coatings, and into a whole range of consumer
products. For the last thirty years or so, the emphasis has been on the
devel- opment of consumer products. To the original corn-based products,
a whole list of’ other product lines, condensed soups, for instance, and
mayonnaise, were added—all aimed at the processed foods market, that is,
at the grocer or supermarket. Yet the industrial prod- ucts business was
continued. The company’s performance, whether measured by growth or by
profits, has been outstanding in processed foods where corn-based
products now account for a fairly small share of sales. The industrial
products business, by contrast, has not done so well. It has not
developed new products out of the original cornstarch tech- nology. And
it has not been able to move into new technologies, that is, into
synthetic glues, adhesives, or coatings based on petrochemicals and
polymerization. It produces volume and grinds up a great deal of corn.
But it no longer achieves market standing, let alone substantial
profits.</p>
<p>The reason is probably not that cornstarch is an “old technology.” A
number of smaller (but still sizable) competitors who have stayed with
the corn-based technology and have made it the foundation for their
diversification are doing well. The reason is that market-based
diversification and technology-based diversification require different
man- agement thinking, different management attitudes, different
strategies, and raise different questions. Either management, especially
top management, will be divided, or one atti- tude and point of view
will prevail to the neglect of the other. It is perhaps not impossible
to develop and manage a diversified business that has both axes of
diversification. But it is certainly difficult.</p>
<p>“Countercyclical” Diversification</p>
<p>Diversification to make a business “countercyclical,” e.g., by
balancing cyclical strengths and risks of a capital goods business
against the different cyclical strengths and risks of a consumer goods
business, rarely works.</p>
<p>It is not true that these two kinds of businesses tend to behave
radically differently in cyclical fluctuations. Or rather they do so
only in the kind of cyclical fluctuation that mat- ters the least; that
is, the relatively mild and relatively short downturn, which is the
classi- cal “recession” of business cycle theory. Then sometimes some
consumer goods do in- deed show greater strength than capital goods. But
where it really matters—that is, both on the upside and the downside of
a major business cycle—the two businesses behave pretty much the same
way. What the consumer goods business may gain in a severe downturn in
terms of sales volume, it is likely to lose through higher credit losses
and lower margins.</p>
<p>The Illusion of “Financial Synergism”</p>
<p>Equally fallacious is the attempt to diversify by marrying a business
with a high demand for capital to a business with a high cash throw-off.
A healthy and growing business rarely produces cash surpluses for very
long.</p>
<p>The one exception to this, the acquisition by manufacturing companies
with substan- tial cash needs of investment businesses such as insurance
companies, for instance, is per- nicious on other grounds. An investment
company, such as an insurance company, a sav- ings bank, or a commercial
bank, is a fiduciary. Its first duty is to invest the money en- trusted
to it in the best interests of its policyholders and depositors, and to
be totally un- swayed by any other consideration. If it is part of an
industrial company, it may subject itself to pressures to invest its
funds which are incompatible with its first duty to its de- positors or
policyholders. And a fiduciary owes it to its trust not to expose itself
even to the most unfounded suspicion that there exists such a conflict
of duties and interests.</p>
<p>Financial “synergy” is a will-o’-the-wisp. It looks good on paper,
but it fails to work out in practice. For two and two to make more than
four—indeed for two and two in busi- ness even to add up to four—a great
deal more “fit” is needed than money alone. Money is universal in that
every effort requires it and every economic value can be expressed in
it. But for that reason money by itself is symbol rather than economic
value and reality. Yet in diversification, economic realities and
economic values have to fit—and this means market, productivity,
technology, and management.</p>
<p>The “financial strategy” that was most popular in the sixties in the
U.S. and England, that is, “acquisition by price/earnings ratio” is even
unsound as a purely financial maneu- ver. It is, in fact, not much more
than a confidence game. To buy a business not because it makes sense as
a business but because the accident of stock-market valuation makes it
possible to acquire it and obtain an immediate increase in the buyer’s
per share earn- ings—i.e., by paying for a stock with a low
price/earnings ratio with a share with a high price/earnings ratio—is
financial sleight-of-hand. It creates “leverage,” that is, raises ap-
parent earnings per share and with it stock prices in a rising economy
and a rising market. But leverage always works in both directions. In a
sagging economy and a sagging stock market such acquisition policy
therefore creates at the slightest setback sharply lower per share
earnings and collapsing stock prices. Such an “acquisition policy” is
simply another variation of the old game of “pyramiding” that was so
popular in the U.S. in the twenties and—deservedly—was outlawed in the
thirties, in which companies sold bonds to buy up the shares of other
companies. The people who fell for it and sold their companies to the
financial manipulators and their “takeover bids” usually found this out
fairly soon— unless they immediately sold the securities they got in the
merger.</p>
<p>To diversify for the sake of diversification rather than because it
is the best thing to do for the business and for its performance and
growth is always a mistake. Yet the grass always tends to be greener on
the other side of the fence. It is always easy to say, “We break our
backs in this business for a 6 percent return on capital; look at this
or that indus- try where they make 20 percent—and then let’s find a
cheap company in that industry and buy it.” But there are almost always
very good reasons why a company is available, let alone why it can be
bought cheaply. Second, the acquired company will not retain its
profitability, very long. The management that knew how to run it is
unlikely to stay. And the management that has bought the company does
not understand the business and is unlikely to make the right decisions
or to put in the right people.</p>
<p>Equally, diversification will fail if its aim is to cure the
weaknesses and vulnerabilities of a business by going into other and
different businesses. It is obviously unsound to say, “Because we are
not competent to manage our own business, we better go into another one
of which we know even less.” Yet this is, in effect, what a company says
which, in order to cure a weakness of its own, acquires another business
which supposedly has the needed strengths.</p>
<p>The same multinational cornstarch-based company mentioned above,
aware of its weakness in chemical technology outside of the milling of
cornstarch, bought a small</p>
<p>company in the polymer-chemical field to obtain its apparently highly
knowledgeable management. Within two years the polymer chemists had
left—as managements of ac- quired companies will do under such
circumstances. And then the cornstarch company found that it could not
manage a business of which it understood neither the technology nor the
markets.</p>
<p>In diversification one has to build on strength. Diversification will
be successful only if it promises a greater return on what one can do,
and do well. It has to be an extension of one’s proven performance
capacity. Whenever management contemplates diversification, whether
through grassroots growth or through acquisition, it should ask, “If
this new busi- ness got into trouble, would we know how to fix it?” If
the answer is no, one better stay away from it. For any business, and
especially a new one or a newly acquired one, will predictably get into
trouble sooner or later, and usually sooner. And then it is the parent
company and the parent company’s top management who have the
responsibility for knowing what action to take and for taking it.</p>
<p>The Need for “Temperamental Fit”</p>
<p>One more thing remains to be said about the management of diversity
and complexity. There is one absolute requirement for successful
diversification: “temperamental” unity. Even if the diversity is
embedded in the common unity of the market or in the common unity of a
technology, it will not work if the diversified businesses, product
lines, markets, or technologies are not compatible in their values.
There must be a common “personal- ity.” There must be what I would call
a “temperamental fit.”</p>
<p>Many of the major pharmaceutical companies diversified into cosmetics
and per- fumes. Not one of them has been successful. No one in a
pharmaceutical business really respects cosmetics and perfumes. To
people who see themselves as engaged in a humani- tarian, a serious, a
scientific task, cosmetics are “frivolous.”</p>
<p>One of the major electrical companies found itself in the years after
World War II suddenly a pioneer in an important area of chemistry. In
order to provide better materials for such uses in its own products as
insulation in electrical apparatus and appliances, or tops for ranges,
the company had gone into chemical research and had, much to its sur-
prise, come up with some major inventions and technical breakthroughs.
It decided to build on this a specialty chemicals business—and has been
totally unsuccessful. “We have the basic patents but the chemical
companies have the market,” commented one of the senior executives of
the company. “We should have licensed our patents right away rather than
try to become ourselves a major chemical producer.” The company has
invested more capital in its chemical businesses than chemical companies
would have done for the same sales volume. It has put good men into
chemical management and it has continued productive research work. But a
chemical business in its basic “temperament” is so differ- ent from the
mechanical businesses with which an electrical apparatus manufacturer is
familiar that decisions and timing were always “a little off.”</p>
<p>It took Sears, Roebuck almost twenty years to learn to market
high-fashion merchan- dise. Sears’s top management, from General Wood
down, insisted on the need to become a leader in high-fashion
merchandise. But no one at Sears, from General Wood down, really
respected high fashion. To Sears, basic “values” were utility, wearing
quality, dura- bility, washability—all sterling virtues, to be sure, but
not what the fashion buyer consid- ers “value.” It was not until a whole
management generation at Sears had passed out of the picture that Sears
was able to develop a successful high-fashion business.</p>
<p>That a business has to “fit” temperamentally and in its values is the
fundamental rea- son why the conglomerates cannot really work. Their
trouble is not only that they try to manage a diversity of markets, of
technologies, of products beyond what any one man- agement can truly
know and can truly understand. Their basic problem is that they try to
manage businesses that cut across a wide range of “temperaments,” of
“values,” of “per- sonalities.” This by itself guarantees that in making
the crucial decisions, the conglomer- ate will make the wrong
decisions.</p>

Note on the Family Business</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>VEN THE MOST SOUNDLY BASED diversification strategy cannot avoid an
casional “misfit.” It is, after all, not truly predictable whether
extension either of</p>
<p>oc-</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>market or of the technology will “fit.” And there are bound to be
occasional “partial fits”—diversifications that are successful but
exceed a company’s ability to manage, or diversifications that might be
successful if only the company could do something it cannot or should
not do.</p>
<p>Managing diversification requires that one knows what to do if a
product, service, or business that looked like a logical extension of
one’s own market turns out not to belong in that market, e.g., because
the consumer defines the market differently from the way the producer
does. It requires knowing what to do with developments that come, so to
speak, organically, out of one’s own business or technology but do not
fit into a frame of com- mon unity. The development may be too promising
to be given up. Yet to try to fit it within one’s business structure is
likely to create splintering and to diffuse. Managing diversification
requires that one know what to do if a business that has had original
unity finds its technology branching increasingly into different
directions that have less and less in common with one another. Sometimes
it is the most successful new development that turns out to go out of
bounds and to threaten, by its very success, to make the whole com- pany
unmanageable.</p>
<p>What every management would like to hear is that it can have its cake
and eat it too, that is, that it can hold on to the misfit and yet
somehow continue to have a manageable and performing business.
Unfortunately, this is unlikely to happen. Managements that attempt this
feat will soon find themselves in the proverbial position of the bird
that has hatched the cuckoo’s egg. The changeling in the nest will end
up by pushing out the le- gitimate brood.</p>
<p>If the misfit is a failure, the course of action is clear: one gets
rid of it, one way or an- other.</p>
<p>But what about the misfit that, viewed by itself, is highly promising
or even apparently successful?</p>
<p>The classic case is GM’s development, in the twenties, of tetraethyl
lead to cure the “knocking” problem of the gasoline engine. This was not
only a scientific achievement. It also was a business achievement. For
“knocking” was a major obstacle to consumer ac- ceptance of the
high-performing but economical automobile on which Sloan had based</p>
<p>GM’s entire strategy. Yet tetraethyl lead was clearly a misfit for
GM. It was a chemical product, rather than a mechanical one. And it had
to go to market as part of the gasoline and thus required a gasoline
distribution system.</p>
<p>The legend persists at GM that the developers of tetraethyl lead
proposed that GM buy a fair-sized oil company and its gas stations to
market tetraethy1 lead. But Sloan was wiser. Instead he teamed up in a
joint venture—Ethyl Corporation—with Standard Oil of New Jersey, which
had the distribution system. This produced more profit for GM than even
owning a large oil company could have yielded. Instead of being a
competitor to the large oil companies, Ethyl became their supplier
worldwide. GM, in effect, made money on almost every gallon of gasoline
sold anyplace by anyone. Yet it not only had a minimal capital
investment. It maintained the essential unity and manageability of GM.
Ethyl was a separate business under its own management of chemical
engineers and chemical mar- keters.</p>
<p>The joint venture is, of course, only one way to handle the promising
or successful misfit. But whatever the way chosen—joint venture,
outright sale, licensing, or spin-off into a separate business—the way
should always lead to a clear managerial divorce. If the misfit is to
succeed, it requires its own management. For what makes it a misfit is
that it does not fall into the market unity or technological unity which
the company’s manage- ment knows, understands, can manage. In turn, the
misfit, if promising or successful, needs its own management—and
deserves it.</p>
<p>Misfits like tetraethyl lead are comparatively rare. Far more common
are “partial fits.”</p>
<p>The usual case is the new product or technology that does not fit
because its success de- mands its own market and its own customers, but
which also constitutes an important supply to the originating business
or an important customer for one of its own products.</p>
<p>GM had a need for tetraethyl lead to be available to its customers.
Yet not one drop of the stuff went into a GM product. The situation was
quite different with respect to the— equally sizable—achievement in
chemical technology mentioned in the preceding chap- ter: the
development of a whole family of new plastic compounds by one of the
major electrical manufacturers. These new plastics promised to have uses
across a very wide range of industries and products. Indeed, without
such large markets the research and capital investment required would
have been uneconomical. Something like 90 or 95 per- cent of their
potential markets lay totally outside the originating company’s
business. But something like 5 to 10 percent—and of course the most
immediately realizable 5 to 10 percent—of the market was in their use as
components for some of the company’s own products. The company decided
to develop the new chemicals itself. But while the new technology has
been a major success, the company did not reap the harvest—chemical
companies did who very rapidly ran around the inventor’s original
patents. It would have been better—for the company and for its promising
“child”—if the new technology had been licensed out or at least been
made the basis for a joint venture with a major chemical producer.</p>
<p>If the new development that requires diversification is a product or
service which promises to provide a profitable and new access to market
for an existing product or ser- vice, that is, if it promises to become
an important customer, one asks, “Is the contribu- tion our product, our
service, our market makes to the new development the essential, the
central contribution? Or is it incidental?” If the former, then it is
likely to be sound and manageable. If the latter, the new development
better be on its own.</p>
<p>The partial fit is the most dangerous temptation in diversification.
The half-understood is always more dangerous than the totally unknown;
it is only too easy to deceive oneself into believing that one really
understands it. It is also so easy to deceive oneself into be- lieving
that one can really make a crucial contribution to its development and
success. But what one does not understand about it is likely to turn out
to be critical, if not decisive.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical companies that went into perfumes and cosmetics
all believed that their chemical and compounding knowledge would be a
major contribution. But the key to perfumes and cosmetics is
fashion—marketing, promotion, and image-creation—all three well beyond
the ken, let alone the values, of a pharmaceutical manufacturer.</p>
<p>Whether contemplating diversification, or managing diversification
that has already become part of the business, top management should
always start out with the question of the successful pharmaceutical
company reported in the preceding chapter: “Could this product, process,
service, technology, or market fit better elsewhere?” If the answer is
yes—or even if it is only “maybe”—one asks, “What would we have to be
able to do to make it fit our business—and how likely are we to learn
it?” One also asks, “What would be the most desirable divorce—desirable
for us and for the misfit or partial fit?”</p>
<p>Diversification that results in misfits or partial fits, that is,
diversification that damages or destroys a company’s core of unity, is
another form of being, or becoming, a business of the wrong size. The
very least that is required is that it not be allowed to endanger
managerial unity, managerial clarity, and managerial concentration on
one’s own business and its opportunities. The minimum action is setting
up such a partial fit as a fully sepa- rate though wholly-owned
business. At least one no longer manages the partial fit. This is,
however, an investment decision. As such it should always be judged by
the same crite- rion as any other decision to invest outside of one’s
own business: “Is this the best in- vestment of the capital available to
us?” Otherwise, it is splintering of scarce resources.</p>
<p>And if not the best—or a very good—investment opportunity,
divestment, either in whole or in part—sale, licensing, or joint
venture—is preferable. This will not only bring greater direct returns.
Freeing management for what it can and should do is likely to bring even
greater indirect results.</p>
<p>The Tools of Diversification</p>
<p>To manage diversification, management has available four tools. Two
are tools to diver- sify: development from the beginning (often called
“grass-roots development”) and acqui- sition. One is a tool to cure
unsound diversification: divestment of misfit or partial fit. One is a
tool both to diversify and to get out of unsound diversification: the
joint venture.</p>
<p>Grass-roots development and acquisition as royal roads to
diversification and growth each have vocal partisans. But it is not
either/or. These are alternatives; and for one im- portant problem,
these two are complements.</p>
<p>It is often said that acquisitions cost more money than grass-roots
developments, but telescope time. This is not necessarily true. Many
grass-roots developments cost more money than acquisition would have
required. At the same time, many acquisitions take longer to produce
results than an energetically pursued grass-roots venture.</p>
<p>One rarely can buy an exact fit whether in markets, products, or
people. To make an acquisition truly serve the purpose for which it was
made may take a long time. Until then it is unlikely to produce the
results it was purchased for.</p>
<p>It is often said that an acquisition, while more expensive than
grass-roots develop- ment, is less risky. This is not true either. The
proportion of acquisitions that turn out to be expensive mistakes or at
least disappointments, is substantial. I would put it close to 50
percent. And while the failure rate of grass-roots development is
higher—perhaps two- thirds—most of them can be recognized as mistakes
and liquidated early, before the in- vestment has become
substantial.</p>
<p>One can never be sure of a grass-roots development, it is said. There
are always sur- prises—and few of them are pleasant surprises, true. But
I have never seen an acquisition or heard of one in which there were not
unpleasant surprises too. Indeed, the one absolute certainty in
acquisitions is that the day after the contract has been signed,
skeletons of all sizes and shapes start tumbling out of all kinds of
cupboards.</p>
<p>What is true is that grass-roots development and acquisition require
different ap- proaches and different temperaments, pose and require
different questions, and run into different kinds of problems. Both have
in common, however, that they must be grounded in a diversification
strategy. “We want to grow, let’s do something different,” is unlikely
to produce results in either approach. “What is our business and what
should it be?” is the starting point for both successful diversification
from the grass roots and successful diver- sification through
acquisition.</p>
<p>But thereafter the two differ in essentials. They are indeed so
different that few com- panies are likely to do well in both grass-roots
development and acquisitions. A company that is constantly “unlucky”
with acquisitions should stop making them. It is not unlucky. It lacks
the temperament for making them. It is not prepared for the
difficulties, troubles, and problems which inevitably follow the most
harmonious and most logical acquisition. Similarly, a company that is
consistently “unlucky” with grass-roots development is not unlucky. It
does not understand the problems of the new and the growing. It does not
have the innovative capacity (on this, see Chapter 61). Neither company
will find it easy to acquire what it lacks.</p>
<p>The two American companies that exemplify this—and that also seem to
understand this—are General Motors and General Electric. GM has not for
decades developed any- thing from the ground up. But GM has an enviable
record for developing into star per- formers successful businesses it
acquires, such as the small and quite successful diesel manufacturer
which GM developed in a few years into the Electromotive Division and
the giant of the railroad locomotive business. GE, on the other hand,
has not done particularly well with any acquisition since its early
days. But it has a highly successful record as a developer of new
successful businesses out of technical or market innovations.</p>
<p>Every management needs to be able to do one or the other: grass-roots
development or acquisition. For each company, or at least each company
beyond small size, may need to diversify. But a management also needs to
know which of these two tools of diversifica- tion fits its temperament,
its way of doing things, its abilities. And then it should probably work
at what it can do and finds congenial. It is better to have great skill
and strength in one hand than to be ambidextrous but skilled in neither
hand.</p>
<p>The basic approaches to grass-roots development and to acquisition
are different to begin with. In deciding to initiate or to go ahead with
a grass roots development the key question is “What can it contribute to
us? What new capability, what new strength, what new market or
technology does it promise to produce for us? And altogether what will
it do for us?”</p>
<p>But in acquisition the key question is always “What contribution can
we make to the new acquisition?” Unless the acquiring company can make a
contribution that signifi- cantly raises the capacity of the acquired
business to perform and to produce results, it is unlikely to be a
successful acquisition.</p>
<p>It is because GM has, it appears, always understood this that it has
been so successful with the businesses it bought. But one need not be a
giant like GM to have a successful acquisition strategy based on the
question “What can we contribute?”</p>
<p>A company in the American Midwest has grown in fifteen years from
tiny to fair—and almost big-size, and to outstanding profitability, by
an acquisition strategy based on care- ful analysis of what it can
contribute. All the company’s businesses make parts and sup- plies for
manufactured products, either mechanical or electronic. And the company
does have substantial manufacturing ability. But it sees itself
primarily as an industrial mar- keter with proven ability to build
market and distribution for industrial products. It con- stantly looks
for successful small to medium-sized companies which have engineering
and manufacturing leadership in products of this kind but which are
being run as manufactur- ing, rather than as marketing businesses. When
it finds such a company it proposes a joint study to the company’s
management. If the study shows to the satisfaction of management in both
companies that a systematic marketing approach would indeed result in
substantial increases, an acquisition bid is made—usually, at a generous
price. So far, every such bid has been accepted. And in all but one of
the eleven acquisitions the company made within fifteen years results
have come up to the expectations, usually within a fairly short
time.</p>
<p>There is one compelling reason for basing an acquisition on one’s
ability to make a contribution. One cannot take for granted that the
management of the acquisition will stay—even if one wants it to stay.
The odds, based on experience, are strongly against its staying on. And
when the acquiring company has to provide management—and the time for
this is usually when there is trouble—one better lead from strength and
be able to con- tribute what the acquisition needs.</p>
<p>That this is not usually a problem in grass-roots development is the
strongest argument for it. There one can acquire in the course of the
development what abilities, skills, com- petences are needed. One can
learn. In an acquisition one has to possess these abilities,</p>
<p>skills, and competences when one goes in.</p>
<p>The “Grass-Roots-for-Acquisition” Strategy</p>
<p>New Deal legislation in the thirties split into two the banking firm
of J.P. Morgan and Co. One of the two parts, Morgan Stanley, took over
underwriting and venture banking—that is, the areas in which the
original firm had been pre-eminent. The firm that continued un- der the
original name inherited commercial banking, which had been little more
than a sideline. The new J.P. Morgan andandandand Co. had the name. It
had the clientele of the country’s biggest businesses. But it lacked the
deposit base to be a major factor in commercial banking. It also lacked
commercial banking knowledge. And it lacked seasoned commer- cial
bankers. Everybody expected J.P. Morgan to drift into well-heeled
oblivion. But not much more than a decade after the split-up J.P. Morgan
took over the Guaranty Trust Company, which, while one of the country’s
oldest and largest commercial banks, had also become one of the
sleepiest. The new Morgan Guaranty Trust Company at once be- came
aggressive and energetic and emerged as New York’s leading “big
business” bank. Though it has only a handful of branches—each a very big
bank in itself—it now ranks fourth among New York banks in deposits and
ranks much higher in trust and investment business. This was brought
about by deliberate diversification strategy which practiced grass-roots
development to make possible successful acquisition.</p>
<p>It seems plausible that Henry Alexander, the Morgan partner who
headed the com- mercial-banking torso after the split-up, realized that
his firm was the wrong size for suc- cessful commercial banking. He
lacked the deposit base. He also probably realized that this could not
be cured by growth, but only by merger or acquisition. He certainly must
have realized that he lacked the strength to make a major contribution
to an acquisition. He therefore went in for systematic grass-roots
development. Specifically, he brought in a fairly large number of bright
young men and trained them in commercial banking. There was much joking
in New York banking circles in those years about “Alexander’s Kinder-
garten.” But when Alexander finally moved and took over Guaranty Trust
he could fill every key spot in a bank ten times as large as his own
with an experienced, seasoned Morgan executive, and could revitalize
every key activity with new but carefully tested ideas and policies.</p>
<p>Precisely because the key to successful acquisition is the
contribution the acquiring company can make to the business it acquires,
grass-roots development can provide the foundation for acquisition. And
because a grassroots development often runs into an “awkward stage,” or
“wrong size” where it needs to make a quantum jump—to a bigger
distribution system, a bigger deposit base, or a broader
technology—acquisition is often the best way to make productive a
grass-roots development. But this requires first the rare ability to
perform both grass-roots development and acquisition. It requires
purposeful business strategy even more.</p>
<p>Divestment of the Misfit</p>
<p>The unsuccessful misfit of diversification should be put out of its
misery as fast as possi- ble. Otherwise it becomes a drain on a
company’s resources and a crushing burden on its management. A
diversification strategy—whether pursued through grass-roots develop-
ment or through acquisition—needs a systematic and purposeful policy for
abandoning the misfit. The successful misfit or partial fit should not
be let go. But it should be moved out of the managerial system. It
should be divested.</p>
<p>Sears has done this with the most successful of the manufacturing
companies it owned and developed: Whirlpool. As long as Whirlpool’s
entire output of appliances was bought and distributed by Sears, Sears
owned the company. When it was then decided that Whirlpool would also
sell appliances directly to the public under its own brand name,</p>
<p>Sears took the company public and retained only a controlling
majority interest in it. And gradually Sears has sold off its Whirlpool
shares as the company grew and prospered.</p>
<p>One reason for this strategy is that a growing and successful
business both needs capi- tal and can obtain it itself. But such a
business also needs genuine managerial independ- ence. It is unlikely
that it will realize its full potential if dominated by another manage-
ment whose interests, vision, and preoccupations are—and should
be—focused on its own business. Such a business is no longer a “child”
but an “adult.” And adults do better standing on their own two feet.</p>
<p>Whirlpool is still the sole supplier of major appliances for Sears.
It has indeed taken over supplying a lot of additional appliances for
Sears, e.g., home heating furnaces. It was, until 1972, managed at the
top by former Sears executives. But the growth that has made it the
hundredth largest company among U.S. industrial corporations has
primarily been in sales directly to the consumer, through its own
dealers and under its own brand name. It began only after Sears had
ceased to be in control. And it was financed directly in the capital and
credit markets.</p>
<p>For the majority of successful misfits or partial fits financial as
well as managerial di- vorce is the right thing from the start. Like
grown children, they need their own “home.”</p>
<p>Divestment is a “marketing” rather than a “selling” problem. The
question is not “What do we want to sell and for how much?” It is “For
whom is this venture ‘value’ and under what conditions?” It is, of
course, a financial transaction. But the salient point is finding the
potential buyer for whom what is misfit to the seller is perfect fit,
the buyer to whom the venture to be sold offers the best opportunity or
solves the worst problem. This is then also the buyer who will pay the
most.</p>
<p>A major printing company decided that a mass-circulation magazine it
owned was at best a partial fit and should be sold. The magazine had
been bought originally to hold its printing contract. Then it had been
in difficulties. Under the printing company’s manage- ment it had been
turned around and was now moderately successful. But the printing
company executives knew that it required new directions and new
strategy. They them- selves neither were, nor intended to become,
publishing experts. Indeed they had con- cluded that they already spent
far too much of their time on a business which they did not really
understand. What the magazine needed, they realized, was publishing
management of a high order. Then they asked, “What is value to a
magazine publishing company?” “If it is a growing magazine company,”
they answered, “its greatest need is cash. For a grow- ing magazine
requires heavy cash investments in building circulation for several
years.” “How can we supply this need of the potential buyer to our own
advantage?” was the next question. And the answer was, “By giving him
ninety days rather than the customary thirty days to pay his print and
paper bill to our printing plants.” For next to investment in
circulation, printing and paper make the largest cash demands on a
magazine. The print- ing company then rapidly found a publishing group
that filled their requirements. The group gladly bought the magazine,
paying more for it than the seller had expected to get. They could,
however, well afford to do so. By getting cash financing for their own
needs, they still came out with substantial cost advantages. The seller
almost doubled what to him mattered most: his magazine printing
business, as he got the printing contracts for the buyer’s other
magazines. He did so at minimal risk. And within two years the buyers
had increased the magazine’s circulation and advertising revenues by 50
percent.</p>
<p>“In looking for a husband for your daughter,” says an old proverb,
“don’t ask: ‘Who’ll make the best husband for her?’ ask instead: ‘For
which kind of a man would she make a good wife?’ “ This is the right
rule for the divestment of a successful or promising misfit or partial
fit.</p>
<p>The Joint Venture</p>
<p>The joint venture is the most flexible instrument for making fits out
of misfits. It will be- come increasingly important. It is at the same
time the most demanding and difficult of all tools of
diversification—and the least understood.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of joint ventures, each of which serves
different purposes and has different characteristics. There is, first,
the joint venture in which the strengths of two different and
independent businesses are pooled together in a jointly owned new
business. Each parent contributes what he can do. The resulting whole
is—and should be—different from the sum of its constituent parts.</p>
<p>The Ethyl Corporation was an early example. A more recent and much
smaller one is the joint venture set up in 1972 by BOAC, a major
airline, and Leasco, a computer- leasing company, to supply to smaller
airlines a reservations system for airline travelers. This venture
combines the programs and process data which BOAC has developed for its
own reservation needs with the computer expertise and the financing
capability of a major computer-leasing company. BOAC saw the opportunity
of converting a cost center into a profit center. But it also realized
that except as a joint venture, that is, as an independent company, this
would be the wrong diversification. It would require the financial
strength which BOAC does not have. And it would detract from BOAC’s own
efforts to run its own business in a highly competitive industry.</p>
<p>The second kind of joint venture attempts to make a viable whole out
of several mis- fits which by themselves cannot survive. It attempts to
provide a quantum jump from the wrong size to the right size, and from
the nonviable to the viable. Here all partners make essentially the same
contribution, though in varying proportions. The whole, however, should
be greater than the sum of its parts—simply because by itself each part
is well be- low the threshold of effectiveness. One might call this
“aggregation by joint venture.”</p>
<p>Here belong the “consortium” banks that have been formed, mostly in
London, in the late sixties and early seventies, to engage in
medium-term lending. The partners are major European banks, American
banks, and in some cases Japanese and even Latin American banks. The
banks are all big and powerful in their own right. But none of them has
the financial strength and, above all, the market to develop a
medium-term loan business that could compete with American giants such
as Bank of America, Chase Manhattan, and First National City, which have
used their medium-term expertise to establish themselves as leaders in
multinational banking. Each of the parent banks of the consortium banks
would have had to invest resources and efforts way out of all proportion
to the results it could possibly hope to achieve had it decided to
compete directly. Yet each could also not have withdrawn from the
medium-term market without losing important customers alto- gether.</p>
<p>Very similar are the joint ventures in raw material supply. The
Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco) is a joint venture of three U.S.
oil giants—Jersey Standard, California Standard, and Mobil—to explore,
produce, and refine petroleum in Saudi Arabia. When Aramco was set up in
the forties, the oil field in Saudi Arabia was already known to be so
large as to produce far more than even a very big worldwide petroleum
company could hope to market by itself. Bringing together the marketing
systems of three major compa- nies, the Saudi Arabian oil fields were
converted from a threat to oil marketing into a ma- jor opportunity.
Finally, there is the joint venture that is created to provide what
might be called “dual nationality.” This is a joint venture created
primarily to harmonize political or cultural obstacles.</p>
<p>The best-known examples, the many joint ventures between Japanese
companies and Western partners set up since World War II, are usually
explained, especially by the Japanese, as harmonizing the Westerner’s
technical and product knowledge with a Japa- nese company’s knowledge of
its market, language, and culture. By themselves, the Japa- nese argue,
the Westerners could not manage in so alien a culture. But there are
enough Western companies successfully operating wholly-owned Japanese
subsidiaries—for in- stance, Singer, IBM, Coca-Cola, and some Swiss
pharmaceutical firms—to disprove this argument. There is little doubt
that most Western companies would have greatly preferred building or
buying their own wholly-owned Japanese subsidiaries. The reasons why
they went into joint ventures are political rather than economic.</p>
<p>The joint venture in Japan is something more important than an
economic marriage of convenience. It is a way to reconcile the
conflicting realities of an economy that is world-</p>
<p>wide and of a political system based on the nation-state. It is a way
to make productive the tension between two different kinds of power:
economic power and political power. It is therefore crucial to the
relationship between the multinational corporation and the small, but
especially the developing, nation. (On this, more in Chapter 59, “The
Multina- tional Corporation.”)</p>
<p>Ground Rules for Joint Ventures</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for a joint venture, the rules which all of them
need to observe are pretty much the same. They have to be known before a
company engages in a joint ven- ture. Otherwise, no matter how
successful the joint venture, there will be grief. Indeed the more
successful a joint venture, the more trouble there will be unless all
the partners— and their child, the joint venture company—fully
understand the ground rules.</p>
<p>Joint ventures can, of course, get into trouble because they fail.
But then it is reasona- bly clear what to do. And then the interests of
both parents are identical. Both want to straighten out the problem. And
if the joint venture cannot be saved, they want to get out with minimum
loss. But when a joint venture succeeds, it becomes problematical. For
then it always becomes clear that the interests of the parents are not
identical and are, usually, barely compatible.</p>
<p>The first rule, therefore, is to spell out in complete detail and
candor three sets of ob- jectives: the two sets of objectives of the
respective parents, and the objectives of the joint venture. It is
crucial to bring out, in advance, the basic differences in objectives
which the two parents can be assumed, with very high probability, to
hold. To say “We want our joint venture child to grow, to prosper, and
to be profitable,” and leave it at that, is simply asking for trouble a
few years hence.</p>
<p>Several joint ventures which large German chemical companies, e.g.,
Hoechst, set up with large American chemical companies in Brazil in the
middle and late fifties failed because they were successful. Then the
two partners began to disagree as to the direction and the policies the
joint venture should follow. Neither understood that the objectives of
the other had been different from the start. Indeed both assumed that
the objectives had to be the same for both. The Germans, for good and
valid reasons of their own, looked upon the Brazilian company primarily
as a user of German-developed technology against li- cense fees, and as
a buyer of German-produced raw materials and intermediates. They did not
even want the Brazilian joint venture to grow very fast, since the
parent company in the early fifties was under severe cash pressure to
finance its own growth in Europe and did not want to have to divert
scarce cash into financing the expansion of a Brazilian sub- sidiary.
The Americans, on the other hand, looked upon the Brazilian joint
venture as a “growth company,” which, in the shortest possible time,
should develop the largest possi- ble business and become both a
producer of its own technology and a producer of its own raw materials
and intermediates. And cash in those years was no problem at all for the
large American chemical companies. In fact, they suffered from excess
liquidity. When, therefore, the Brazilian companies began to grow fast,
the two partners found themselves in such irreconcilable conflict that
these joint ventures had to be liquidated with one or the other of the
two partners taking over.</p>
<p>Even when the objectives have been spelled out in advance, there is
danger of dis- agreement among the partners—and again, especially in
case of success. And both being equal—and usually equally stubborn as
well—there is no one to resolve it. A way to make a decision in case of
disagreement or deadlock should be built into the joint venture from the
start.</p>
<p>I consider it necessary to provide in advance, for instance, for an
arbitrator, an out- sider, who is respected by both parties and to whom
conflicts and disagreements will be brought. His verdict is to be
considered as final and binding. One disease to which a joint venture is
particularly prone is politicking in which the people within the joint
venture try to play off the parent companies against each other. This
can poison the atmosphere to the</p>
<p>point where the joint venture ceases to be viable. To provide in
advance for settlement of disputes is therefore elementary hygiene.</p>
<p>The joint venture has to have autonomy. The reason for forming a
joint venture is that a business, a product line, a market, an activity,
does not fit into the structure of either parent company. Then the joint
venture must be set up so that it can develop its own busi- ness, its
own mission, its own objectives, its own strategy, its own policies, in
true auton- omy.</p>
<p>This, of course, leads to the question “Who manages a joint
venture?”</p>
<p>In all but the “dual-nationality” joint ventures the answer is clear.
The joint venture needs its own management. It is not part of the
business of any of its parents, but a sepa- rate business. But the
dual-nationality joint venture is part of the business of both parents.
It is still preferable for it to have its own management. Otherwise it
should be managed in its entirely by one of the parents. Joint
management will not work and will only lead to frustration.</p>
<p>In the successful ventures between Japanese and Western companies in
Japan, man- agement is usually in the hands of the Japanese. The
Japanese in the management of the joint venture are de facto executives
of the Japanese parent company, on loan to the joint venture, who retain
their position in the seniority and promotion structure of the Japanese
parent company. In these companies there are also Americans—or other
Westerners— who are supposedly part of the joint venture’s management.
But in effect they are techni- cal advisors and usually badly frustrated
ones. Conversely, there are a few Japanese- Western joint ventures in
Japan where the Western partner has management responsibil- ity. And
then the representatives of the Japanese parent in the joint venture’s
management feel frustrated and are “outsiders.”</p>
<p>Finally, if the joint venture succeeds, and especially when it gets
to be a big business, it should be spun off. It should cease to be a
joint venture. Maybe the parents still retain an investment. But the
business then becomes independent for all intents and purposes. It
should acquire at least a minority of outside shareholders where capital
markets permit. It should finance itself, or at least be capable of
self-financing. Otherwise it will be stunted. General Motors and Jersey
Standard sold Ethyl in the fifties precisely because it had be- come too
big and too successful to be a joint venture any longer.</p>
<p>Sometimes a joint venture, especially if it is of the aggregation
type, may be split up and divided between its parents. This is bloody
and painful. But it might be the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Standard Vacuum was set up around the time of World War I as a joint
venture by Standard Oil of New Jersey and Mobil Oil to produce, refine,
and market petroleum products in the Far East. When it started, the
market in Southeast Asia was both already too large to be left
unattended, and yet still too small to give much scope. By the 1950s,
this was clearly no longer true. And the two partners also were in
fundamental disagree- ment on objectives and strategies. They therefore
decided to split Standard Vacuum, with each parent taking half of what
had been a unified company. Despite the severe trauma inflicted on a
very proud management team by such major surgery, both Jersey Standard-
Southeast Asia and Mobil Oil-Southeast Asia were within ten years larger
than Standard Vacuum at a joint venture had been projected to
become.</p>
<p>To keep Standard Vacuum as a joint venture after it had become a big
and successful company retarded its growth. Even if objectives are clear
and management autonomous, a joint venture will still, in the last
analysis, be looked upon by its parents as a tool for their objectives
rather than as a business on its own. And once a business has become
estab- lished and successful, this is wrong policy and wrong
posture.</p>
<p>Diversification will, it is fair to predict, be of even greater
importance in the years and decades to come. The pressure of “the new
markets”—the mass market for investment and capital, and the mass market
for jobs and success; the emerging world economy; the dynamics of
technology, will all push companies toward diversifying. It will,
therefore, be of utmost importance for a top management to understand
what pressures to accede to and what pressures to resist; to distinguish
between sound diversification that strengthens</p>
<p>unity and manageability, and diffusion that splinters; and to be able
to manage diversifica- tion and diversity.</p>
<p>A Note on the Family Business</p>
<p>The complexities and diversities discussed so far are complexities of
business, its prod- ucts, markets, technologies. But there is also an
important case where the complexity is not a function of business
structure but of management structure: the family business.</p>
<p>The family business used to be the norm. And there are still many
around—even big ones. But in developed countries, at least, where there
is a supply of professional manag- ers and where availability of capital
is not limited to inherited wealth and family fortunes, the large family
business is clearly on the wane. What are its needs? What does it have
to do to survive? What are its limits of size and time span?</p>
<p>There is little doubt that beyond a certain size a business can no
longer reserve man- agement to family members and remain viable. Beyond
a certain size—and that usually means beyond being fair-sized—the
management burden increasingly has to be borne by professional managers
with little or no ties to the family that founded the business. Own-
ership may still be in the hands of these families. In Japan, for
instance, ownership of the Zaibatsu groups remained in the hands of the
founding families till the end of World War II, despite the giant size
and complexity of each group. But even though Japanese families can—and
do—adopt freely, Zaibatsu management had long before 1900 become profes-
sional non-family management in all of the groups.</p>
<p>In the major European and American family companies, family also
often remained important beyond the fair-sized stage. At Siemens in
Germany, for instance, the family was powerfully represented in
management until after World War II, that is, for a hundred years. At
the Du Pont Company in the United States, the family is still powerful
in man- agement, seventy years after two Du Pont brothers and a cousin
took over, in 1902, some floundering old black-powder mills and started
building today’s Du Pont Company. But both at Siemens and at Du Pont,
professional managers long ago became equal members of the
top-management group, in authority, influence, and decision-making
powers (though not necessarily in official myth and in the proprieties
of protocol).</p>
<p>Beyond a certain size, the family can perpetuate itself only if it
succeeds in attracting and holding first-rate men who are not members of
the family—not even by adoption (which the American Du Ponts have
practiced, perhaps even more successfully than the Japanese even though,
unlike the Japanese, the “adopted” Du Ponts, who have married Du Pont
daughters, do not change their names). The family business, if it wants
to per- petuate itself, better think through, and fairly early, what
needs to be done to make living and working with a “ruling family”
acceptable to the outsider.</p>
<p>The rules are fairly simple—both Du Pont and Siemens worked them out
many years ago. Only those members of the family who, on their own
merit, qualify for a top- management position are allowed to stay in the
business. A family member in a family business has a position of
authority and power, regardless of his title and rank, even re- gardless
of his job. He has the inside track to the top—as a son, a brother, a
brother-in- law. No matter what his rank, he is top management. If he
cannot command the respect due a member of top management on his own
merit and on the basis of his performance he should not be allowed to
stay on the payroll.</p>
<p>Cousin Paul may indeed have to be supported by the family. But if he
is not of top- management caliber, he better be paid a stipend to stay
away from the office. Outside of the company he costs only his stipend.
If he is allowed to work in the company, he costs a great deal more:
respect for the family, ability to attract and hold good people, and
career opportunities for those who truly deserve them.</p>
<p>A family member who lacks ability but is willing to work hard may
still be tenable.</p>
<p>People will accept, though not very willingly, his right to a job.
The family member who is not willing to work, no matter how able, must
not be allowed in a family company. He destroys morale and breeds both
resentment and cynicism.</p>
<p>And, as Pierre du Pont realized when he restructured the Du Pont
Company in 1920 and made it capable of becoming a truly big and
successful business, the professional non-family members in the
top-management group must be given rewards and incentives that make them
feel like “owners.” Pierre du Pont invented the first stock-option plan
in American business, over the strenuous opposition of the other members
of his family. But he felt strongly and, as events proved rightly, that
without such a plan first-rate non-family members would feel
discriminated against. It is not the money that matters; it is the
status.</p>
<p>Even if the family company succeeds in attracting the professional
management it needs once it has grown beyond a certain size, it is
unlikely to perpetuate itself forever. The family’s entrepreneurial
qualities may not weaken. The Rothschilds have maintained theirs for
close to two hundred years, which is quite a bit longer than any other
dynasty on record—business or non-business—has kept its genetic vigor.
But family members be- come increasingly independent as the family
company grows and prospers. They can af- ford other pursuits and will be
attracted to them. Fewer and fewer of the members of the family, and
especially fewer and fewer of the truly able ones, will be willing to
devote themselves to the business and to give it hard work and
dedication. Eventually, the family company becomes a professionally
managed business in its entirety. Such members of the family as may
still remain in the business then become the exception rather than the
rule. The Rothschilds, it is well known, vie in pride of family with any
royal family anywhere. But even the Rothschild banks now have
non-Rothschild partners. Once this happens, the family business has
ceased to be a “family business.”</p>
<p>To run a successful family business therefore demands planning for
the day when the very success of the business makes necessary changing
its character. Within two genera- tions—and with growth to fair size—the
family becomes the beneficiary rather than the boss of such a business.
If the planning is well done—as, for instance, by Pierre du Pont in the
early twenties—careers in the business still remain a challenge for the
ablest and hardest-working members of the family. The others should much
earlier have become outside investors.</p>

<p>THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION raises diversity and complexity to new
levels and makes new and unprecedented demands on top management with
respect to business strategy as well as structure and behavior.</p>
<p>The multinational corporation is the outstanding social innovation of
the period since World War II—a period otherwise lacking in social
innovation and in social imagination. It has become the foremost
non-nationalist institution in a world torn asunder by parox- ysms of
nationalist fever and an organ of integration in a world of political
fission. This makes the multinational corporation important beyond its
service as a business institution. But this also makes the multinational
corporation a difficult and problematical institution. Indeed, the
testing period is still ahead for the multinational corporation. If it
cannot re- solve the contradictions it has created, both internally and
externally, as a result of being multinational in a nationalistic world,
it is unlikely to prosper. For the multinational cor- poration is both
cause and result—but also symbol—of a most profound event of the post-
World War II period—the split between economy and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Multinational public-service institutions are lacking so far. There
are “international agencies,” but they are, for the most part,
coordinating, rule-making, or research organiza- tions rather than
actors and performers. The only truly multinational public-service agen-
cies capable of action in their own right rather than as agents of
governments are the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (the
latter, especially, since Interna- tional Drawing Rights were introduced
as a supplementary “key currency” in 1971) and both, of course, reflect
the same reality of a world economy distinct from political sover-
eignties that underlies the rise of the multinational corporation.</p>
<p>However, just as the economy is in the process of splitting off from
sovereignty, so is the ecology. Truly transnational environmental
organizations capable of acting and per- forming in their own right and
without regard to national boundary lines are urgently</p>
<p>needed. “Pollution” may be a local phenomenon, comparable with (and
indeed closely linked to) production. But environment is becoming
worldwide just as the economy is in the process of becoming. In dealing
with oceans and ocean beds, air resources and cli- mate, soil and raw
material resources, “sovereignties,” even those of the biggest and larg-
est nations, are increasingly coming to be seen as restraints rather
than as the carriers of effective action. The multinational corporation
may therefore well become the prototype and forerunner of a truly
multinational public-service agency of tomorrow just as, domes- tically,
the management of business can now be seen to have been the forerunner
and pro- totype of “management” for public-service institutions. And the
multinational environ- mental agency of tomorrow will, predictably,
encounter all the problems and questions of the multinational
corporation of today, both internally and in its relationships to the
multi- tude of political sovereigns, i.e., nation-states, their
governments, but also their cultures and values.</p>
<p>This chapter discusses businesses and uses only business examples and
business illus- trations—it is all we have so far. But everything said
in it should be applicable to the mul- tinational public-service
institution if and when it emerges.</p>
<p>If multinationalism is the most dramatic economic development since
World War II, it is also the least understood. Myths abound regarding
the multinational corporation. It is commonly believed to be something
radically new and indeed unprecedented. But it is also the revival of an
old trend. There were multinationals galore in the nineteenth cen- tury.
And the fear of the multinationals is nothing new either. The most
articulate outcry against being “taken over by the Americans” can be
found in English books and magazine articles of 1900.</p>
<p>Both in the United States and in Europe, major scientific and
technical inventions of the nineteenth century led almost immediately to
the emergence of multinational corpora- tions; that is, of companies
that were making and selling goods in many countries. This was the case
with Siemens in the 1850s; the English subsidiary was founded almost im-
mediately after the German parent company, as was a subsidiary in
Russia; for long years these subsidiaries almost overshadowed the German
parent. McCormick’s harvester and the reaper-thresher of his English
rival, Fowler, also went multinational in the nineteenth century. So did
Singer’s sewing machine and the Remington typewriter within a few years
after the original patents had been issued. The trend accelerated in the
early twentieth century when, for instance, the Swiss chemical and
pharmaceutical companies became multinational. Fiat and Ford both
established subsidiaries abroad within a few years of their founding. In
the 1520s such prototypes of the multinational businesses of today as
Unilever and Royal Dutch/Shell were established.</p>
<p>The surge of the multinationals in the fifties and sixties
represented in large measure a resumption of the pre-World War I trend
rather than a totally new development. It ex- pressed a return of the
economic vitality and capacity to grow which World War I had paralyzed.
Even in form, the multinationals of the present closely resemble the
pre-World War I development: a parent company with wholly-owned
subsidiaries and affiliates in other countries. Unilever and Royal
Dutch/Shell—the Anglo-Dutch companies with two parent companies in two
countries and with top management and headquarters in two countries—are
far more truly multinational in their structure than the new
multinationals of the recent past.</p>
<p>In some areas, indeed, there was more multinationalism in the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries than there is today. Before
World War I, for instance, two insurance companies domiciled in
Trieste—then part of Austria-Hungary—were writing large amounts of life
insurance through subsidiaries in thirty to forty countries all over the
world, in Europe, in Latin America and Africa, on mainland China, and in
Russia.</p>
<p>Another myth about the multinational corporation is that it is
entirely or primarily an American development. To be sure when the
development got going in the fifties, it did so under the leadership of
American companies. The reason for this was in part American economic
and financial strength during this period. More important, however, were
the economic policies of European governments. Despite the Common
Market, the govern-</p>
<p>ments of Europe for a long time were unwilling to let their
businesses become European businesses. Mergers or even “communities of
interest” across the national boundaries of Europe were discouraged and
frowned upon by most European governments (the British being the
exception). It was therefore left to the Americans to avail themselves
of the op- portunities which the Common Market created. It is not too
much exaggeration to say (as Servan-Schreiber did in The American
Challenge, 1968) that it is largely the American initiative which
converted the Common Market from good intentions into economic real-
ity.</p>
<p>But the phase in which the leadership in the development of
multinational corpora- tions was in American hands came to an end in the
mid-sixties. Since then, non-American businesses have taken the lead. By
the early 1970s a little more than half of the business done by the
multinationals was still done by companies headquartered in the United
States. The other half was done by companies headquartered in many other
places and managed as Dutch, Swiss, German, Swedish, French, English,
Japanese—and in a few cases, Latin American—companies. By the mid-1960s
the movement toward multination- alism had become general. The growth of
the non-American multinationals since had been far faster than that of
the American-based ones. And it promises to be faster still. The
Pan-European company, in particular, is likely to emerge as a major
factor in the world economy.</p>
<p>Another prevailing myth is that multinational business development is
confined to big business. A prediction widely quoted in the early
seventies asserted that by the mid- eighties of this century the entire
manufacturing of the world would be in the hands of three hundred large
multinational world companies, each doing business worldwide, and each
doing many billion dollars in sales.</p>
<p>Actually multinational companies come in as many sizes as national
companies do.</p>
<p>The concentration of economic power is not necessarily greater in the
multinational sector than it is within any national economy. Small
multinational businesses may even have proportionately grown faster all
along and may have done better. They just do not make the headlines.</p>
<p>Such small to medium-sized companies are building a multinational
business on excel- lence and leadership in one small ecological niche.
Here are some examples:</p>
<p>A Swiss-based company doing precision mechanics employs 1,800 people
all over the world for a total sales volume of less than 0 million. It
operates in almost fifty countries and manufactures in almost a dozen
countries. It has grown from fifty employees in 1960; that is, it has
grown more than thirty-fold in a dozen years.</p>
<p>There is, similarly, an American-based company of about the same
size. When it started to go multinational, it employed only about one
hundred people in Southern Cali- fornia. Ten years later it did business
in some thirty countries with manufacturing plants in half a dozen:
Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, Brazil; and, in joint ventures, Japan
and Yugoslavia. It also built on the basis of leadership in a very small
but highly demanding branch of technology on the boundary between
chemistry and metallurgy.</p>
<p>There is the company which supplies spare parts for aircraft to most
of the smaller air- lines of the world, with warehouses and maintenance
facilities from Accra to the Fiji Is- lands and Warsaw. There is the
small New York Stock Exchange firm specializing in research for
institutional investors which has offices and partners in London,
Brussels, and Hong Kong, and which serves as many institutional
investment clients outside of the United States as it does within the
United States.</p>
<p>These are still small businesses and likely to remain so. Yet they
have become as fully multinational as the big companies.</p>
<p>The idea that it is manufacturing that has gone multinational is a
misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The fastest growth has been in finance, where the large American
commercial banks went multinational before their clients did.</p>
<p>The most dramatic development on the multinational front are the new
“consortium”</p>
<p>banks in which large and medium-sized commercial banks pool their
resources in a joint venture to become multinational “universal banks.”
One example is CCB, the group</p>
<p>formed by the German Commerz Bank, the French Crédit Lyonnais, and
the Italian Banco di Roma. Other consortium banks have British,
American, Canadian, Brazilian, Belgian, Dutch, Japanese, Australian,
Austrian, and Scandinavian partners.</p>
<p>The management consultants, the auditors, and the advertising
agencies have also moved well ahead of the American-based manufacturing
companies. And Sears, Roebuck started to go multinational in the late
l940s when it moved simultaneously into Canada and into Latin America,
and later on, in the 1960s, into a number of European countries. In
fact, the Sears, Roebuck store may have had greater impact on economy
and society of Latin America, in Peru, in Colombia, and in Brazil, than
any of the manufacturing com- panies that established subsidiaries in
Latin American countries. And when Britain de- cided in 1972 to join the
Common Market, retailers such as Lyons and Marks andandandand Spencer
moved much faster to become “European” than did manufacturers.</p>
<p>The period of most rapid growth of multinationals—the fifties and
sixties—was the period of the most rapid growth of international trade.
Indeed, during this period the world trading economy grew faster—at an
annual rate of 15 percent or so in most years— than even the fastest
growing domestic economy, i.e., that of Japan. And the Japanese clearly
could not have grown at the rate they did if protectionism had made
impossible economic expansion based on exports abroad. It is not in the
most heavily protected in- dustries where multinationalism has forged
ahead the fastest. It came late, for instance, in the chemical industry,
which is very heavily protected. But pharmaceuticals, where pro- tection
plays a minor role, was a leader from the start. And there has been
almost no mul- tinationalism in the heavily protected steel
industry.</p>
<p>But the best proof that protectionism is not at the bottom of the
multinational trend is the European development. The rise of the
multinationals began when continental Europe abolished protection and
joined in a common market. The common belief that the growth of the
multinational companies has to do with trade restrictions will not hold
up. The mul- tinationals create export markets for their country’s
products. The multinational’s subsidi- ary abroad is the best market for
its home country’s machinery, its chemical intermedi- ates, and so
on.</p>
<p>This shows clearly in American trade figures. Neither the export
markets which Amer- ica has been losing nor the markets in which imports
have become important in the U.S. are those in which American
multinationals are active. The American textile companies are still
almost completely domestic. So are the American producers of chinaware,
of flat glass, and of shoes. The foreign automobiles which have taken an
increasing share of the American market are not those the overseas
subsidiaries of the American automobile companies make. They are
Volkswagens, Renaults, and Toyotas. But of the American exports, an
increasing share, perhaps amounting to as much as one-third of the
exports of manufactured goods in the late sixties and early seventies,
were exports by the same com- panies that vigorously expanded
multinationally, and were, above all, exports to the sub- sidiaries of
such companies abroad. Very much the same thing applies to the Dutch,
Swiss, Swedish, German, and Italian balances of trade.</p>
<p>Multinationalism and expanding world trade are two sides of the same
coin. And far from being a cause of multinationalism, protectionism is
incompatible with it. Indeed, an emergence of protectionism would be the
greatest threat to the multinational corporation.</p>
<p>The Common World Market</p>
<p>The true explanation of the explosive upsurge of the multinational
corporation is some- thing far more important than either American
economic strength or protectionism. It is the emergence of a genuine
world market, that is, a market which is not limited or defined by
national, cultural, or even ideological boundaries, but transcends them.
The market is</p>
<p>no longer even international but increasingly “non-national,” and
based on common worldwide demands and expectations.</p>
<p>The great and unprecedented event of the post-World War II period is
the fact that country after country, as its income and, above all, its
information, increased, developed the same or similar demand patterns.
This was unexpected. When World War II came to an end, it was “known”
that the European countries and Japan, should they ever regain economic
health, would develop different demand patterns. No one then doubted
that an economically recovered France would surely have appetites and
demands totally different from the United States, but also from Japan,
from the Soviet Union, from Germany, or probably even from neighboring
Belgium. This certainty—a certainty grounded in the reality of
nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century experience—explains why such
differ- ent people as De Gaulle and Khrushchev considered the emergence
of a common demand, that is, of a genuine worldwide market, as
“abnormal” and proof of some sort of “conspir- acy.”</p>
<p>By now we know that all the talk in the 1950s about the
“Coca-Cola-ization” of Europe was nonsense. It was not that Europe
became “Americanized.” It was simply that the mass market, the
“post-industrial” market, to use a slogan of the sociologists, had first
become visible and overt in the United States. But when conditions
appeared that were similar to those in the United States—not so much,
however, higher incomes as greater mobility and a wider horizon of
information—the demand pattern all over the world proved to be the
same.</p>
<p>This does not necessarily mean that the same goods and services have
a worldwide market, and that what sells in one area will sell in
another.</p>
<p>A cautionary tale is the failure of one of the big multinational food
processors to in- troduce dehydrated soups into the American market. In
Europe these soups had become a main pillar of the company’s success,
had become immensely popular and were growing fast. When introduced into
the U.S., they failed. It turned out that what is high conven- ience for
the European housewife means nothing to the American housewife. The
light weight of a dehydrated product as against a heavy can means little
to a woman who goes shopping by car. And the small bulk of a dehydrated
product has little appeal to a woman who has ample space in her kitchen,
as the American housewife has. Its longer prepara- tion time and its
shorter shelf life, carrying with it a danger of rancidity, make the
dehy- drated soup less convenient than the canned soup despite the
latter’s weight and bulk.</p>
<p>But housewives—American, European, Japanese, and all the others—want
conven- ience and are willing to pay for it.</p>
<p>The demand pattern that has emerged in the world economy is not the
demand pattern the economists expected. The customer proved again that
he knew better than the experts what he wanted.</p>
<p>The great demand has been for a little mobility—and a little
power—that is, for such satisfactions as the automobile gives; earlier
they had been inaccessible to any but a few very rich and very powerful.
Another common demand is for a little health care so that a child has a
fair chance to live to adulthood in a reasonable state of physical
health and unscarred by disease or crippling deformation. It is demand
for a little education. It is demand for access to a big world, which is
what the news media, the movie, the radio, the television set offer to
the masses who for millennia were limited in their knowledge, their
horizon, and their vision, to the confining valley around them and to
the small town in which everybody knew everybody else and in which
everybody lived exactly the same life. And then there is the desire for
the “small luxuries,” for the things that are, in effect, assertions of
personality over the confinement of poverty—the lipstick, the candy bar,
the soft drink, and the ballerina slipper.</p>
<p>These have emerged as the universal demands. They are not based on
affluence. They are based on something far more potent: information. If
the world has not, as Marshall</p>
<p>McLuhan announced, become a “global village,” it surely has become a
“global shopping center.”</p>
<p>One effect of the change in the world economy is that every business
from now on, even a purely local one, will in effect have to be managed
as if it operated in a worldwide economy, even though it sells only in a
small district. It will have to be international in its vision, just as
a business operating in, say, southwest Bavaria has long had to be “Ger-
man” in its vision, or a business operating in northern Michigan
“American” in its vision. Just as that German business in Bavaria or the
Michigan business in America has to un- derstand and know its own
national economy even though it does not operate in any but a small
corner thereof, so will any business henceforth have to understand the
major cur- rents and trends of the world economy.</p>
<p>This development cannot be undone. Protectionism could indeed make
the world economy poor and impede its functioning to the point of near
collapse. But it cannot de- stroy the common demands. It cannot undo the
worldwide horizon and vision. The fun- damental change has happened
irrevocably. The question is not whether it will remain. The question is
whether it can be turned to advantage—for society, for the individual,
and for the business enterprise.</p>
<p>And the multinational corporation is both the response to the
emergence of a common world market and its symbol.</p>
<p>The World Market as Integrator</p>
<p>A market integrates. It converts “resources” into “factors of
production.” The national markets—the great achievement of the
“commercial revolution” of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries—integrated “factors of production” within a national economy.
The common world market, as it is emerging now, integrates the same
factors of production within a world economy.</p>
<p>The traditional theory of the international economy still sees
countries having “com- parative advantages” with respect to their
“factorial costs.” And insofar as they produce those things in which
they have the greatest advantage, everybody’s resources will be
optimized. The guiding example is still Adam Smith’s exchange of English
wool against Portuguese wine. In this theory the individual country is
the market that integrates the factors of production. And what is being
traded are finished goods. Goods are mobile. The factors of production
stay put.</p>
<p>But with a common world economy as the integrator, it is no longer a
country that is the unit of production. The goods are the same
everywhere—or pretty much so. The mo- bility is in the factors of
production. Whereas international trade meant trade in goods or
services, it now increasingly means trade in the factors of
production.</p>
<p>To be specific, the most advanced multinational of the nineteenth
century was proba- bly Singer Sewing Machines with big, ultramodern
plants in Scotland, France, Russia, Japan, and many other places, in
addition to the original plant in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The Scottish
plant at Clydeside near Glasgow was probably a more efficient plant with
lower costs than the Bridgeport plant; it was also the bigger plant. It
produced the same machines Bridgeport produced; and it produced the full
range of Singer machines. But even though tariff walls were minimal in
those days, Clydeside produced only for the British market; at the same
time it produced everything Singer sold in Britain.</p>
<p>Compare this to the multinational of today. A major pharmaceutical
company sells drugs in more than eighty countries of the world. In each
of these countries it sells its en- tire product line. It has
manufacturing plants in eleven countries: the U.S., Canada, Mex- ico,
and Brazil in the Americas; in Britain, France, Germany, and Italy in
Europe; in South Africa, Japan, and Australia. Only a few of the main
drug products in the com- pany’s line are made by all eleven plants.
Most of the company’s drugs are made in only one plant, a few in two or
three. Even the U.S. plants do not turn out the full product line. As a
result, each of the plants sells some drugs to every one of the
eighty-odd sales com- panies; and every one of these sales companies
buys some drugs from each of the eleven</p>
<p>manufacturing plants. Pharmaceutical drugs are made from chemical
intermediates, e.g., from citric acid, which is the chemical base for
many antibiotics. The company manufac- tures intermediates in seven
countries: U.S., Mexico, Ireland, Great Britain, France, Aus- tralia,
and Japan. Again, no country makes all the intermediates—each
specializes. Each therefore supplies all eleven manufacturing plants.
But each also sells a good part of its output—in some cases, more than
half—directly on the outside to other competing phar- maceutical
companies and to a wide range of chemical manufacturers. Research,
finally, is being carried on in four countries—the U.S., Britain,
France, and Japan, with a fifth research lab, in Brazil, to open in the
mid-seventies. Again, each lab is specialized. The French lab, for
instance, does all the company’s research on central-nervous-system
drugs but also all the work to convert drugs originally designed for the
treatment of human dis- eases into drugs suitable for the veterinarian.
And a drug developed by any one of these four research labs may be put
into chemical testing and market introduction first in any one of the
eighty countries in which the company operates.</p>
<p>But it is not only the—admittedly complex—pharmaceutical industry
that integrates factors of production rather than trade in goods.</p>
<p>The most successful Detroit-designed “small” car, Ford’s Pinto, gets
its engine from Ford’s German company, its transmission from Ford’s
British company, and much of its electrical system from Ford’s Canadian
company—but is sold exclusively in the U.S. and by Ford’s American
company. Similarly, major components for the Volkswagen sold in the U.S.
are being made by Volkswagen do Brazil in São Paulo.</p>
<p>When it was announced in the spring of 1972 that all British
government agencies would henceforth buy their computers from the one
British computer company, ICL, the British subsidiary of the American
Honeywell company pointed out in protest that its computers, though made
by an American-owned company, contained a larger proportion of
British-made components than the computers of British-owned ICL.</p>
<p>In the services areas, this integration of the factors of production
within a common world market has gone even further.</p>
<p>A major U.S. bank arranged a 5 million, five-year loan for a Japanese
manufactur- ing company in early 1971. The deal was initiated in Tokyo
and by the bank’s Japanese representative. The deal was worked out by
the bank’s offices in London and Frankfurt. The syndicate that advanced
the money contained eight banks, one each from the U.S., Japan, Great
Britain, Holland, Sweden, France, Switzerland, and Latin America. Most
of the money was raised in Germany, where interest rates at the time
were favorable. And the purpose of the loan was to finance a
manufacturing subsidiary of the Japanese com- pany in Latin America. Yet
this was a routine transaction such as each of the participating banks
engages in every week.</p>
<p>So far, most multinationals are still cast in the nineteenth-century,
Singer Sewing Ma- chine mold—that is, each subsidiary makes products or
furnishes services for its own dis- crete national market. But the trend
is toward the integration of the factors of production for a common
worldwide market. It is the trend that follows from the logic of the
market itself.</p>
<p>The term multinational is of very recent coinage: it was unknown even
twenty years ago. It fits the nineteenth-century structure—Singer Sewing
Machine—much better than it fits the development to which it is being
applied. Singer Sewing Machine was truly “mul- tinational.” But the
pharmaceutical company that integrates eleven drug-manufacturing plants,
seven intermediate plants, and four research labs into sales of many
drug products in eighty countries is not multinational. It is
“transnational.” And so is the automobile company that integrates plants
in Germany, Britain, Mexico, and Canada for a sale in the U.S., or the
commercial bank that integrates banking resources in eight countries to
raise money in a ninth country to finance a development in a tenth
country. National bounda- ries are no longer determinants. They are
restraints, obstacles, complications. What de- termines is the reality
of a non-national common market.</p>
<p>The term multinational, in other words, obscures reality rather than
explains it. It is by now, however, probably too deeply entrenched. Even
though it will have to be used, it</p>
<p>The Split Between Economy and Sovereignty</p>
<p>The development of a common world market has not been paralleled by
the development of a world political community. The years during which
the world economy created a demand for multinational business were years
of continuing splintering in the world po- litical system. The world
political system is still based on the concept of the national sov-
ereign state. For the first time, therefore, in three hundred years
economy and sovereignty are becoming divorced from each other.</p>
<p>Such divorce was normal until the seventeenth century. Indeed, no one
up to that time conceived a unity of economic entity and political
entity. The unit of economic activity was first and foremost a local
agricultural community, such as the medieval manor, pro- ducing most of
the things it consumed. And the other unit was long-distance trade,
totally divorced from any political system and carried out by merchants
of trading cities who, in effect, constituted a transnational and
closely integrated trading society. The bankruptcy in 1557 of the
Spanish Crown, Europe’s leading political power of the time—a traumatic
event without precedent—brought the intercity merchant society crashing
down in finan- cial ruin from which it never recovered. But it also
demonstrated to the emerging national rulers that to have political
sovereignty, they had to take control of their own money and credit
system and with it of their own economy. (See also the discussion of
mercantilism in Chapter 27.)</p>
<p>The idea of a “national economy” as it emerged in the seventeenth
century conceived for the first time of the political sovereign as
engaged in economic as well as in political and military competition.
The last remnants of the old separation of political sovereignty and
economy, the international gold standard, then disappeared in the
aftermath of World War I.</p>
<p>But while the victory of the national state as the economic sovereign
seemed com- plete—and became indeed the major tenet of Keynesian
economics in the interwar pe- riod—the postwar period has seen an abrupt
reversal of what for three hundred years seemed a law of nature. It has
seen the emergence of an autonomous world economy which is not just the
sum of national economies.</p>
<p>The clearest symptom of this is to be found in the financial sphere.
When the U.S.</p>
<p>government, in 1967, tried to stop the multinational expansion of
American companies and restricted the investment of U.S. funds abroad (a
move prompted as much by pressure from America’s allies, such as De
Gaulle’s France, as by concern for the U.S. balance of payments), the
world economy successfully nullified the decree of the world’s most pow-
erful government. It immediately created the Eurodollar market (see also
Chapter 7) which took over the financing of the multinationals—a market
which essentially made European funds available to the American
companies for their expansion in Europe.</p>
<p>Few governments, even during the heyday of mercantilism, have
suffered from the de- lusion that they are truly “independent”
economically. It always had to be recognized that the outside world
exerts powerful influence on the domestic economy even of the strong-
est country, and that it sets very real limits on the freedom of action
of the political sover- eign. “Autarky,” most governments knew, was a
delusion (though the United States gov- ernment, and especially the U.S.
Congress, have frequently been victims of the delusion that their
economy is, so to speak, on a separate planet and that U.S. policy, U.S.
regula- tions, and U.S. fiat can operate independent of outside economic
realities). But it has been for three hundred years the basic aim of
national policy to keep this outside force and</p>
<p>restraint to a minimum; to do so constituted the essence of national
sovereignty. The emergence of the multinationals, while an effect rather
than a cause of a fundamental change, is therefore a direct challenge to
deeply rooted convictions, to deeply entrenched political institutions,
and to habits of the mind, now three hundred years old. It is not only
that the emergence of businesses which are multinational contradicts the
doctrine—by now considered axiom by most—of the national state as the
“natural” unit of organization for every sphere of human and social
activity. It also contradicts the doctrine—heresy three hundred years
ago, but by now a comfortable article of faith—that every institution of
society must, ultimately, base its legitimacy and derive its
constitution from the govern- ing organ of the sovereign state, the
national government.</p>
<p>What makes the multinational business so important is precisely that
it challenges these axioms.* It is the first non-national institution—at
least it is the first modern institu- tion of importance which considers
national boundaries an incident and a restraint rather than part of its
own definition and identity. And this, in a world that threatens to be
de- stroyed by nationalist passions, is an important institution. But it
is by that token also a problematical and endangered one.</p>
<p>So far we have no theory, whether political, social, or economic, to
account for the re- ality of the world economy and therefore for the
behavior of the multinational corpora- tion. The only, theories we have
are those of the “national economy,” that is, the seven- teenth-century
theories of national sovereignty. This need not surprise anybody.
Theories follow events. One can only codify what has already
happened.</p>
<p>But it means that the multinational corporation has to grope its way,
has to improvise as it goes along, has to experiment and test rather
than proceed along clearly understood lines and on the basis of firmly
grasped principles.</p>
<p>It means also that the multinational corporation is an
extraordinarily difficult structure.</p>
<p>It presents difficulties internally, with regard to its basic
business strategy, its manage- ment structure, and its managerial
relationships. It represents new problems with regard to its external
existence in its environment, and with regard to its relationship to the
national state in which it does its business and into whose political
jurisdiction it inevitably falls— there being no other political
jurisdiction available.</p>
<p>Even if, as some people suggest, multinational corporations could
incorporate with some international or supranational agency, the United
Nations, for instance, or a Euro- pean Parliament, they would still be
multicultural. For it is not only political sovereignty that is
national. Different peoples have different cultures, beginning with
their language. This is bound to become more of a problem as the world
economy becomes more univer- sal. The more homogeneous economically the
world becomes—in its appetites, at least, if not in its actual economic
conditions—the more will local and cultural roots be needed. People need
a home—and even the most luxurious 2,000-room hotel is not a “home.”
Managing the multinational corporation is therefore largely a problem of
integrating po- litical and cultural diversity into managerial
unity.</p>
<p>The Problems of Strategy</p>
<p>What distinguishes the multinational corporation from any other
business is that it faces both internal and external diversity. It has
to create unity within its own managerial or- ganization and yet do
justice to the diversity of peoples, nationalities, and loyalties within
it. And it has to create a unified business that can optimize factorial
costs and factorial advantages within a common world market and yet live
in peace—or at least without con- stant conflict—with a multitude of
separate political sovereignties.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical company mentioned earlier needs a strategy for the
company as a whole. But each of the eighty-odd national companies needs
one as well. So do the manu- facturing units, the units making
intermediates and the research laboratories. Each has to</p>
<p>*One of the best books on the multinational corporation is
Sovereignty at Bay by Raymond Vernon, (Basic Books, 1971): this may be
exaggeration—but sovereignty is being challenged.</p>
<p>be managed as an autonomous business with its own objectives, its own
priorities and plans, its own profit and loss responsibility.</p>
<p>But at the same time, none of these units is truly autonomous. All
are interdependent.</p>
<p>It may, for instance, seem to be purely a concern of the subsidiary
in a given Latin Ameri- can country whether to accept an offer from the
country’s national health service of a con- tract that guarantees a
sizable market for a drug for five years but at a 25 percent reduc- tion
in price. Yet such a price concession may set off demands for lower
prices from the health services of other Latin American countries—and
without any five-year purchase guarantee. It may appear purely a matter
for one of the intermediate plants within the sys- tem whether it
decides to expand its facilities because outside customers, that is,
other pharmaceutical manufacturers, are increasing their uses of a
substance it makes. But this immediately raises the question whether the
company’s own plants for finished products are to be considered
preferred customers whose orders will be given priority, or whether the
new outside customers are to be considered as preferred customers, or at
least as equals. If the first line is taken, the company decides in
effect to optimize its own manu- facturing unit’s results at the expense
of sub-optimizing the results of the intermediate unit. If the second
alternative is taken, the company decides, in effect, that being an in-
termediate manufacturer is more advantageous than being a drug
manufacturer.</p>
<p>These are strategic decisions. They have long-term—and often
irreversible—impact.</p>
<p>They cannot be made by “the top” alone. They require local knowledge.
But they cannot be made locally either. They affect the whole company
and must be made at the top. A multinational strategy which takes into
account only the overall company is condemned to futility. Unless it can
be translated into specific strategy for individual markets, it cannot
succeed. But the multinational strategy which is decentralized, that is,
a strategy which considers each unit and each market as an autonomous
business, is equally condemned to futility. And it is
impossible—theoretically as well as practically—to predict in advance
whether the company-wide, overall approach to strategy or the
market-by-market ap- proach to strategy will be appropriate to a given
situation.</p>
<p>The large-scale commercial banks have a similar problem. It is their
very strength—it is indeed the reason for their existence as
multinationals—that they can give financial service anyplace in the
world. Equally it is their strength that they can offer one-stop
banking—that is, that they can satisfy the major financial needs of a
customer, whether for short-term money or for long-term loans, and even
for equity capital, whether in dol- lars, in German marks, or in
Japanese yen. This, however, requires one strategy which focuses on the
needs of a major customer, such as, for instance, one of the big
interna- tional companies, wherever they might arise. Whoever is in
charge of this particular area, e.g., the major airlines, therefore has
to look upon the entire bank as one business, as one resource, as one
pool of capital, and as one pool of services. But at the same time, the
bank’s manager in any one particular market needs a strategy for his
business. He needs to think through which companies in, for instance,
Japan, are potential customers and for what services of the bank. He
needs to be able to mobilize the resources of the bank worldwide for
their needs. But he also needs to build up a purely local business. For
the multinational customers of today are, as a rule, yesterday’s
satisfied local customers. Again, neither one global, bank-wide strategy
nor local strategies can suffice. The bank needs both—and can never say
in advance which of the two should come first, or which of the two
actually govern a particular business relationship.</p>
<p>Few multinationals have thought through business strategy so far. One
exception might be Unilever, which, for many years, has systematically
planned both for the entire Unilever group, for major product lines
within, such as edible oils and fats (margarine), soaps and detergents
or fish, and for each major country. Fiat, in its deliberate policy of
encouraging government-owned but Fiat-built automobile plants in
communist Eastern Europe may be another example. A more recent and so
far not yet truly tried case is Phil- ips in Holland, with business
strategies both for major product groups—of which Philips has
sixteen—and for each of the countries in which Philips does business. No
American company, to my knowledge, has so far done anything
comparable.</p>
<p>But every multinational company faces the complexity of business
strategy, precisely because it has to be both unified for the entire
company and specific for each major prod- uct category as well as for
each major market. This means that the multinational has com- plexity
built into its very structure. It is multicultural, it is multinational,
it is multi- market, and also multi-management.</p>
<p>Adding to this a diversity of businesses makes the company
unmanageable.</p>
<p>The successful multinationals are in effect single-market or
single-technology compa- nies. There is IBM, which has only one product.
There are the pharmaceutical companies which have only one customer, the
physician. There are the multinational commercial banks which have only
one technology: financing business. There is Sony, which is the most
multinational of all Japanese companies with almost half of its sales
and profits coming from outside of Japan—yet concentrated on consumer
electronics, and on a fairly small range at that. There is ADELA, the
multinational venture banker in Lima, Peru, which concentrates on Latin
America. And the multinational business services—the man- agement
consultants, the public accountants, and the advertising agencies which
may have grown even faster than the multinational businesses
themselves—are also, of course, highly concentrated in what they “make”
and in what they “sell.”</p>
<p>Without such fundamental business unity, the multinational company
splinters into fragments. Management people lose the ability to
understand each other, even with the help of an interpreter. The company
then rapidly degenerates into a bureaucracy which adds more layers the
less it truly directs and controls. The temptation to diversify, no mat-
ter how great in any given case, should be firmly resisted in a
multinational corporation. The multinational conglomerate is an
abomination.</p>
<p>The Top-Management Teams</p>
<p>Of necessity, the multinational has not one but many top-management
teams. It has as many top-management teams as it has business
strategies. Corporate top management is one such team. But for each
country, region, or product line there is another team. Insofar as
members of the corporate top management also sit on a top-management
team for a country or a market they are members thereof, rather than the
team leader.</p>
<p>No one so far has found a satisfactory answer to the problem of
top-management structure in the large multinational corporation. One
thing, however, is clear. The tradi- tional pattern is not the
answer.</p>
<p>The traditional pattern constructs towering hierarchies in which
levels are heaped on levels. The head of a national company typically
reports to a regional executive who re- ports to another regional
level—such as a European or a Latin American executive—who in turn
reports to an, international vice-president who in turn then reports to
corporate top management. This not only denigrates the man who has to
make the actual decisions, that is, the head of a business in a given
country, it also creates a cumbersome bureaucracy, the main achievement
of which is to delay decisions.</p>
<p>Some alternatives to this pattern can already be seen, and they do
offer advantages.</p>
<p>The most satisfactory structure is perhaps that which Unilever has
been developing.</p>
<p>There each company in any country reports to one of the two head
offices of the parent company, that is, either to London or to
Rotterdam. But for each of the major product groups, e.g., soaps or fish
or retail trade, there is a coordinating committee at headquar- ters,
usually composed of people who have successfully operated businesses in
the par- ticular area. And within each major country, such as Germany,
where Unilever has a number of companies, there is a “national board”
composed of former senior executives of the companies in the country and
chaired, as a rule, by a distinguished citizen of the country. This is
cumbersome enough. But at least the head of a Unilever company, wher-
ever he might be, has direct access to top-management people who can
make a decision. Normally he will not use the right of access. He will
rather work with his national board or with the committee in his product
area. But organizationally he reports directly to top</p>
<p>management. And this status within the company gives him status
outside, within the in- dustry in his country, with the country’s
government, with labor unions, and so on.</p>
<p>But even within Unilever the balance between the need to look upon
each company, as an autonomous business, the need to look upon each
major product area as a unified busi- ness in its own right, and the
need to look upon the whole company as a unit, in terms of capital
appropriation or of key personnel, for instance, is difficult,
precarious, and easily upset. At the very least, far too much time is
spent on working out organizational relation- ships and on keeping the
system going.</p>
<p>There are other alternatives.</p>
<p>One of the leading American multinationals, CPC (formerly Corn
Products), has or- ganized itself into five distinct companies: two
American ones (consumer goods and in- dustrial products), a European
one, a Latin American one, and a Far Eastern one. Each is headed by its
own president whose headquarters are within his territory. The company’s
top-management team of three or four men constitutes the board of each
of these compa-</p>
<p>nies. It spends equal time working with the presidents of each of
these companies and their senior men, at their locations, acting as the
presidents, advisors, review organ, and resource.</p>
<p>Only one organizational conclusion has emerged clearly. In the
multinational, the top- management team of the overall company must not,
at the same time, be the top- management team of any of the operating
companies, and least of all of the operating</p>
<p>company where the headquarters are located. As soon as more than a
very small fraction of a company’s business is multinational, top
management has to divorce itself from run- ning any one national or
regional component on any product area. Otherwise, it will spend all its
time on its own immediate management job and will neglect the other
businesses.</p>
<p>This, in other words, means that the traditional organization in
which top management is both the top management of the overall company
and that of its largest single—and usually the domestic—company, while
all the rest of the business is under an international division, is the
wrong structure. Wherever it persists—and it is still fairly common—it
does damage or weakens the company’s performance.</p>
<p>It was long ago proven that a central government cannot be
ambulatory. A multina- tional organization needs a headquarters.</p>
<p>The best example of a “multinational government” in Western history,
that of the gov- ernment of Charlemagne, proved this point in the ninth
century. Charlemagne’s court moved from imperial castle to imperial
castle. This was the only way in which the Em- peror could keep contact
with his representatives in the various parts of the empire. But in a
pre-monetary age, the court could also support itself only by living off
the land. This dependence on ambulatory headquarters was a major reason
why, almost immediately after Charlemagne’s death, the empire fell apart
and split up into manageable pieces; that</p>
<p>is, pieces that a ruler could govern from one place of residence. And
yet Charlemagne’s court did not even suffer from “jet fatigue,” though
“ox-cart fatigue” must have been se- vere.</p>
<p>A fixed place of business is a necessity for managing. Work requires
time, continuity and rhythm and schedule. One needs the organized,
systematic support which one can build up only over long years in one
place. Imperial chancellors can perhaps travel all the time, as can
executive vice-presidents. Market research men, accountants, personnel
peo- ple, that is, people paid to think—not to mention secretaries or
computer experts—have to stay put if they are to produce.</p>
<p>But at the same time, local decisions have to be made at the scene of
action. The local decision has to be made within the framework of
corporate strategy. But it has to be a local rather than a corporate
decision if it is to be effective. The headquarters for the local
business—and this may be European or it may be Swedish—has to be where
the decision is to be effective. It has to be made with full knowledge
of local conditions. It has to be made in cooperation with people on the
spot and in relationships with local institutions. It has to fit local
laws, local expectations, local habits. It has to be, above all,
comprehensi- ble to the people who have to carry it out, that is, to
loca1 people whose knowledge of the</p>
<p>overall company is of necessity limited. The factory manager in Spain
or the manager of the branch bank in Hong Kong achieves his results
through his local knowledge, his local contacts, local action.</p>
<p>Yet the pharmaceutical company manager in a Latin American country,
the manufac- turing manager in Ford’s engine plant in Germany, or the
Chase Bank branch manager in Frankfurt must know enough about the
objectives, strategies, and needs of the entire com- pany not to make
the wrong decisions. He must know enough not to make decisions that
optimize his own business but sub-optimize the whole company.</p>
<p>There is another important problem in top-management structure for
the multinational.</p>
<p>Top-management structures are not mechanical; they are, above all,
cultural. The top- management structure which an American management
group accepts as right and proper may appear decidedly odd and
uncomfortable to a French, a Japanese, or a German man- agement group.
Yet these French, Japanese, or German managers have to understand their
own local top-management group, have to feel comfortable with it, have
to work with it. To be successful, the top-management teams in a
multinational have therefore to be dif- ferent in their structure in
different countries, or else they will not make local sense. Yet they
have to be compatible at least throughout the company, or else various
top- management teams cannot work together.</p>
<p>discussed in more detail later in this chapter.)</p>
<p>The Individual Manager</p>
<p>Even more perplexing than top-management structure in the
multinational is the design of the individual manager’s job and of his
function.</p>
<p>The man who heads the subsidiary of a major pharmaceutical
company—whether the company be American, Swiss, Dutch, British, or
German—in, say, a medium-sized Latin American country, e.g., Colombia,
has to be a big man in his own country. He may head the largest
pharmaceutical company in his country and be one of the largest
employers, especially of educated people. With health care a major
political and governmental matter in such countries—as it should be—he
better be a man of considerable standing. Among the heads of
pharmaceutical subsidiaries in such Latin American countries are, for
in- stance, several men who were deans of the leading medical schools in
their countries be- fore they went into industry, and several who had
served as ministers of health.</p>
<p>Drugs are the one part of modern medicine which a developing country
can use effec- tively. It is easier and cheaper to obtain modern drugs
than to educate and pay physicians, build hospitals, or develop health
services in poor rural areas and in urban slums. Drugs, therefore, are
likely to play a far more important part in the health-care system of
such a country.</p>
<p>Yet in terms of sales, the country does not account for much more
than a fair-sized sales district in one of the major developed
countries, such as Kansas City in the United States or Manchester in
England. How then should the executive be structured within the overall
organization?</p>
<p>This is a problem which conventional organization theory cannot
solve. The Unilever structure described earlier comes closest to solving
it. But again, the only solution is to say that the head of the
Colombian subsidiary is both manager of a fair-sized sales district and
a member of company top management. Which of the two he is depends on
the situa- tion. In fact, it must largely be left to him to decide which
role the situation demands. He should always have immediate access to
the company’s very top. But he should rarely use it. Yet he should also
be the kind of man whom corporate top management looks to for
leadership, guidance, advice, and counsel on major policy matters, e.g.,
on relationships with governments throughout Latin America, on
long-range strategy in Latin America, and so on. He surely should not
report to a Latin American vice-president in Basel or</p>
<p>New York. He also should not have to “clear” the great bulk of his
day-to-day problems with people who are even more junior.</p>
<p>Again, only systems-management concepts, nebulous though they are,
are truly perti- nent. Ordinary organization charts are likely to
confuse rather than to clarify.</p>
<p>A Man Needs a Home</p>
<p>Equally difficult are the problems of management personnel policy, of
opportunities, status, pay.</p>
<p>The ablest man, by common consent, in the entire management group of
one of the major American-based multinationals was the head of the
Italian company, Dr. Manzoni. Manzoni had first become known to the
company as the lawyer representing the Italian owners of a medium-sized
business the American company acquired. The American president was so
impressed by him that he asked Manzoni to take over when the Italian
subsidiary ran into trouble a few years later. Manzoni restored the
Italian subsidiary to health and rapidly built it into the leading
Italian business in its industry. When the Com- mon Market came into
being, Manzoni planned and spearheaded the company’s expan- sion
throughout Western Europe, found the right acquisitions and partners,
found man- agement people for the new companies, trained and developed
them, and, to all intents and purposes, ran the European companies of
the group from his Italian headquarters. When finally replacement for
the company’s aging chief executive in the United States had to be
found, everybody at once thought of Manzoni. But Manzoni turned the job
down flat. My sons are in high school and I do not want them to become
expatriates. My wife has old parents whom she cannot leave alone. And
frankly, I myself see little that would make me feel at home in a small
Midwestern town, and few attractions there that could compare with those
of Rome. I know that I could do the job you want me to do— and the job
is a fascinating one and far more than I would ever have dared aspire to
in my wildest dreams. But, still, it is the wrong job for me.”</p>
<p>People need roots. They need a home. They have a right to be
concerned with the education of their children. They have a duty to
aging parents. And they are probably more realistic than the company’s
personnel vice-president when they argue that they are unlikely to
“transplant” well. Yet the company better find a way to put to work the
talents of a Manzoni. If (as this company did, by the way) it concludes
that the man is no longer “promotable” and relegates him to second-class
citizenship, it cuts off its nose to spite its face. Such a man will
leave—as Manzoni did within a year or two.</p>
<p>How then can one build a management structure which recognizes and
indeed respects the roots of a man and yet builds a truly multinational
team?</p>
<p>It is clear that one requirement is equal opportunity regardless of
passport. A Manzoni must have the opportunity to get to the top
according to his abilities. To deny the oppor- tunity and to reserve
senior management positions to people of a given nationality is to
deprive the multinational corporation of its ability to attract capable
people in every coun- try in which it works. Companies domiciled in
small countries, such as Holland, Switzer- land, and Sweden, confine, by
and large, senior management positions in all their subsidi- aries and
affiliates to nationals of the parent company who have been trained and
who have started their careers in the parent company. (The only
exception to this rule is the United States, where the major Dutch and
Swiss companies have, for many years, pro- moted Americans into their
top management. But the American subsidiary, of these com- panies is
usually the largest unit within the entire group and has to be managed
as a truly separate entity.) There are advantages to this—communications
obviously are much eas- ier. And some of the disadvantages which
companies domiciled in large countries, such as the United States or
Great Britain, would suffer it they followed this practice are not in-
curred by companies headquartered in smaller, neutral countries. No one
worries much about Swiss imperialism.</p>
<p>But even in these cases, the policy is clearly not in the company’s
best interest. With competition for first-rate management people
intense, good young men will not come to</p>
<p>work in a company—or will not stay—unless they have equal
opportunities. A company which, no matter what its professions, promotes
only nationals of the mother country into senior positions, in its
subsidiaries and affiliates or at home, is unlikely to obtain or to hold
the managerial resources it requires.</p>
<p>words, to make a virtue out of its being transcultural. Otherwise it
will be less attractive than a well-managed purely domestic company. Yet
a man’s national roots, national loy- alties, national culture, and his
need for a “home” must be respected.</p>
<p>How to Pay?</p>
<p>There are also serious compensation problems of the multinational
executive. Should ex- ecutives around the world be paid the same salary
in line with their position? Or should salaries fit the widely varying
local standards? Should the American or Dutchman who is sent from his
parent company into the management of a subsidiary be paid on the local
scale—which, for instance, in Japan would mean a salary far too low for
an expensive place like Tokyo—but also receive substantial “benefits,”
e.g., in the form of housing or an unlimited expense account? And what
about the man who heads what is in effect a small business within the
corporate structure—the president of a pharmaceutical subsidi- ary in
Colombia, for instance, who in terms of the size of his business is a
middle-level executive, but who in terms of his position in the country
is a top man?</p>
<p>Again, the requirements are not easily compatible. It is highly
desirable to make it possible for a man to move and not to be penalized
by a promotion. Yet if people are be- ing paid according to the
prevailing standards in the country in which they work, being promoted
very often will mean that they are being asked to take a cut in pay.</p>
<p>The most extreme cases of this are the Japanese executives who are
sent to work in the United States or in Europe. Even though what
Japanese executives in New York and Düsseldorf receive is low by
American or German standards, it is unheard of by Japanese standards.
When, after five years or so, the successful Japanese executive is
transferred back to a much bigger job at home, he often has to take a
cut of 50 percent of income or more.</p>
<p>But, to have one member of a management group, and especially a
member from abroad who is also a foreigner, paid quite differently from
the rest of the group is disrup- tive.</p>
<p>By far the most serious compensation problem arises out of the
fundamental business strategy of the multinational. For the
multinational manager needs to be both a member of the top-management
team of the whole company and of the top-management team of the unit for
which he works. Traditional compensation plans, especially plans with
big bo- nuses geared to the results of the unit which the manager
manages directly are therefore likely to be both unfair and destructive.
They penalize teamwork, just where teamwork is needed the most.</p>
<p>This can be seen in its most acute form in the multinational
commercial bank. In the teacher example, the New York bank’s
representative in Japan, who initiated the business and produced a new
and major client for the bank, had nothing to show for it in his profit
and loss statement. The London branch, which did all the work, showed in
its books only a liability. The Frankfurt branch, simply because it had
a German mark surplus available, showed all the income from the deal.
The typical bonus policy would highly reward Frankfurt, penalize London,
and leave Tokyo out altogether.</p>
<p>To tie a man’s compensation to the results of his own branch or
territory will therefore make him slight the very opportunities that
might produce the greatest results for the bank—opportunities where the
actual transaction might be done by another branch or by headquarters.
To pay him on any other basis, however, or to rely on personal and
subjec- tive judgment rather than on impersonal and objective
yardsticks, is equally undesirable. But what is desirable is by no means
clear yet—let alone how it can be achieved.</p>
<p>In almost every area throughout this book examples of successful
approaches could be given. But I have not been able to find yet a
successful and working compensation policy for managers in multinational
business. American companies profess the same frustration and confusion
as European or Japanese ones. And every compensation policy in multina-
tional corporations I know of is forever being restudied, reorganized,
revised. The most successful policy may well be that of a major Swiss
pharmaceutical company which frankly says, “We know that whatever we do
will at best take care of symptoms for a few months; but at least we try
to make our management people understand that there is no solution and
that day-to-day accommodations to the worst problems of the moment is
the best they—and we—can expect.”</p>
<p>A true multinational which completely transcends in its management
structure, in its managerial jobs, and in its personnel policies,
national and cultural boundaries is neither likely nor perhaps
desirable. What is needed is a floating balance between conflicting
needs and conflicting demands. A multinational must be able to use a
Dr. Manzoni as a member of the top management of an American-based
company and yet respect his le- gitimate desire to remain a resident in
his own country and a member of his own culture. It must be able to have
both an overall company strategy and local strategies for a given unit.
It must be able to pay for performance and yet encourage teamwork. It
must be able to be both centralized and decentralized, and to know when
to be one or the other.</p>
<p>The requires a great deal of formal structure and policy. But it
requires, even more, a great deal of mutual knowledge, mutual trust, and
shared experience. Above all, it re- quires tremendous self-discipline
throughout the entire managerial group.</p>
<p>The Multinational and Its Environment</p>
<p>Practically every argument against the multinational corporation
advanced in any country is by itself a fallacy. It can be disproved
easily. And yet the disproof is not going to con- vince the critics and
enemies of multinationalism. They may be using the wrong argu- ments.
But their hostility is directed toward a reality. They are formulating
the problem wrongly. But there is a real problem.</p>
<p>In its host countries, even highly developed ones with substantial
economic strength of their own, the multinational is attacked as being
impervious to the country’s economic, social, and financial policies,
and as undermining the country’s sovereignty and its gov- ernment. It is
attacked as having a power of decision over what will be produced, over
jobs, over industrial and economic policy, which is illegitimate and
beyond proper con- trol. Decisions, rather than rest in the country’s
legitimate authority, such as its parliament or government, are
exercised in a shadowy and indefinable way, someplace far away, by
faceless men who neither know the country nor care for it.</p>
<p>But in the multinational’s home country it is also attacked—and in
strong countries, including the United States, as well as in weak ones.
Here too, the multinational is seen as a means to evade, if not to
subvert, political authority and of creating a superpower, not
accountable to anyone and yet in control of economic policy, of jobs,
and even, to a large extent, of policies in non-economic areas. The
American-based multinational is accused in the United States of
“exporting jobs” but also of using its subsidiaries abroad to evade U.S.
policies such as the former ban on trading with Red China. And it has
been attacked with equal bitterness in host countries abroad because the
subsidiaries in these countries, by not being willing to trade with Red
China, defied and subverted the host country’s, e.g., Canada’s or
Sweden’s, own policies in international affairs.</p>
<p>The counterargument of the multinational companies is a perfectly
valid one. No busi- ness, no matter how rich and big it may be, has any
power against a national government. In any clash between economic and
political power, at least in this century, economic power has come out a
very poor second. The multinational exists, like any business, at the
sufferance of national government.</p>
<p>But this argument does not go to the heart of the matter. The real
problem is that the multinational by its very nature must look upon the
economy in non-national terms. It</p>
<p>This is the true difference between the twentieth-century
multinational and its prede- cessors before World War I.</p>
<p>It is the function of the multinational in a common world market to
allocate produc- tion and markets according to economic logic; that is,
to optimize production and distri- bution across very large areas, if
not the entire world. But “production and distribution” is simply
another term for jobs, for imports and exports, that is, for balances of
trade and balances of payment, for wage levels—and altogether for
economic conditions and eco- nomic policies.</p>
<p>It is simply not true that the economic optimization of the
multinational “exports jobs.” Every study has shown that it creates
jobs. The goods its subsidiaries abroad pro- duce and market would not
otherwise have been made in, and bought from, the multina- tional’s home
country. But the subsidiary buys equipment and supplies from the
multina- tional’s home country. Indeed the multinational, by moving
production to people, may be a major force in preventing dislocation and
turbulence. The alternative—large-scale mi- gration of low-skill and
low-income peoples—whether Blacks into Harlem, Algerians into France,
Turks into Germany, sharecroppers from Brazil’s Northeast into São
Paulo, or Sicilians into Torino—creates, we now know, unbearable
tensions. The economist— almost any economist—would therefore conclude
that all the criticism of, and resistance to, the multinational, is
misinformed.</p>
<p>But this misses the point. The multinational is a problem precisely
because its deci- sions are based on economic rationality and divorced
from political sovereignty.</p>
<p>There is no solution. The multinational is a political problem not
because of anything it does or does not do. It is a problem because
political sovereignty and economic reality no longer coincide. It does
the multinational no good to protest that it and each of its sub-
sidiaries are “good corporate citizens” of the country in which each
operates. Of course, it and each of its subsidiaries observe the laws—at
least to the same extent to which the country’s nationals observe it.
But if the phrase is meant to imply—as it usually does— that the
multinational in every country in which it operates thinks and acts in
terms of that country’s national economy and market, it is nonsense. To
do so would deny the whole logic of the multinational corporation, which
is to optimize resources within the world market reality.</p>
<p>But to reassert against the multinational the reality of national
sovereignty is also fu- tile. This is what De Gaulle tried to do. The
only result was a rapid decline in the com- petitive position of the
French economy in the world. It is no accident that the French have
become the strongest advocates of the proposed law for a “European
transnational company.”</p>
<p>There is indeed a real need for new international law to come to
grips with this ten- sion.* Such law will not only have to define under
what conditions countries accept multi- nationals and what limitations
they may impose on ownership, on remittance of profits and repayments of
capital, and on freedom of movement of goods, people, and capital from
one subsidiary of a multinational to another.</p>
<p>It will, above all, have to “depoliticize” the multinational. Insofar
as this means that the multinational will be forbidden to try to use the
political strength of its home govern- ment for its own ends, beyond
what it is entitled to under the new international law, this should
present relatively little problem. As far as relations between developed
countries are involved, such use of political power for corporate ends
has long ceased to be feasi- ble. And as far as relations between the
developed and economically strong home country</p>
<p>*As has been argued for many years and with great cogency by Jack N.
Behrman, former Assistant Secretary of Commerce of the U.S. under
President Kennedy, and now Professor of Intemational Economics at the
Univer- sity of North Carolina.</p>
<p>of a multinational and an economically weak developing country are
concerned, it is by now abundantly clear that “multinational
imperialism” is futile.</p>
<p>After the electoral victory of the Left in Chile in 1970, an officer
of ITT suggested to the Nixon Administration that it foment economic and
political chaos in Chile to prevent the inauguration of a Marxist
president and to save ITT’s Chilean telephone company from
expropriation. The officer only ensured that the Nixon
Administration—despite its hostility to the new Chilean government—would
do nothing and remain scrupulously un- involved. Still the Chileans
seized upon this to attack all foreign business, and business
altogether.</p>
<p>Any future international law regarding the multinational must outlaw
any action of this</p>
<p>kind. In whatever country it operates, the subsidiary or affiliate of
a multinational is clearly entitled to no more political support from
its home government than a private citi- zen.</p>
<p>Far more difficult will be the legal resolution of the question of
preference given by governments to their own national businesses. To
what extent should it be permitted? To what extent, for instance, should
the universal practice of giving limited or absolute pref- erences to
national producers in public works or government purchases be legalized?
And who is a national producer in the age of the multinationals?</p>
<p>In the example cited earlier of the British government ruling to have
British govern- ment departments give preference in buying computers to
British-owned ICL, “national” was defined by ownership. British
Honeywell’s protest against the ruling, in effect, asked that
nationality be defined by the number and location of jobs. Both
companies are, of course, British in terms of their incorporation and
location. And with respect to many other products even the British
government accepts the logic of the Honeywell argument.</p>
<p>The thorniest issue is that of the reach of the home country’s
jurisdiction. It is also the one which the U.S. will find the most
difficult.</p>
<p>Traditional U.S. legal—or at least governmental—doctrine has held
that any subsidi- ary or affiliate of an American company abroad is
subject to American jurisdiction, with respect to antitrust, for
instance, but also with respect to restrictions on trade with certain
countries. But American anti-trust ideas are by no means universally
accepted as sound or even as moral. Compulsory cartels, for instance,
are in most continental countries (and in Japan) considered normal
instruments of economic policy. And competition is seen as more of a
vice than a virtue.</p>
<p>Resolving these problems by a common code of behavior is the only way
to make the multinational what it should and could be: a powerful
instrument for economic strength and political harmony. The problems are
largely political and legal. But they are problems which it is the
duty—and the opportunity—of top management in the multinationals to
think through. Otherwise, it is safe to predict, political solutions
will be imposed on the multinationals which can only damage them and the
world economy. Few of the multina- tionals even seem to be aware of the
task. They seem to assume that the problems will go away if only no one
talks about them—which is neither intelligent nor responsible.</p>
<p>The Multinationals and the Developing Countries</p>
<p>Some 80 percent of multinational investment and business—after taking
out as not truly multinational the plantation and extractive industries
(such as crude oil production or iron-ore mining)—is in developed
countries. And so is some 80 percent of world trade, again subtracting
agricultural products and raw materials.</p>
<p>But both the greatest contributions and the greatest problems of
multinationalism lie in the developing countries.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there are few things a developing country needs as
much as the mul- tinational corporation. There are few contributions
from which it can benefit so much as from those only the multinational
corporation can make. A developing country needs capital. It needs
access to technology even more. It needs access to markets for whatever
goods its one surplus resource—labor—can produce.</p>
<p>The greatest contribution the American multinationals have made to
countries like Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, has been neither
capital nor technology. It has not even been entrepreneurial and
managerial skill—these countries, being ethnically Chi- nese, have
adequate supplies of both. It was a guaranteed market in the U.S. for
the tex- tiles, the Christmas ornaments, and the radio sets which these
countries manufacture.</p>
<p>Most of all, a developing country needs a way to acquire
skills—industrial skills, managerial skills, entrepreneurial skills. And
no other institution has so far proven capa- ble of providing the
transfer of skills, on which rest all hopes for the economic and social
development of a developing country.</p>
<p>But at the same time, a developing country, almost by definition, has
a balance of payments problem. The more capital it imports, the more
foreign exchange will it have to produce to service the capital. Even
more important, a developing country, almost by definition, has a severe
problem of national identity. It may be—and usually is— “nation- alist.”
But it rarely has a tradition of nationhood. And the multinational
company in which a country’s ablest, or at least its most affluent,
people are subordinate to “bosses” else- where—in London or New York,
Rotterdam or Tokyo—creates a problem of national loyalty and allegiance,
at least in the minds of people who are desperately struggling to define
their own national identity. It also creates a “brain drain”—the ablest
people go to work for a foreign employer. This creates a feeling of
dependence, if not of helpless im- potence, in the face of
concentrations of economic power compared to which a poor coun- try
looks puny indeed.</p>
<p>It is not just paranoia that makes a Peruvian or, for that matter, an
Indian minister feel that a big multinational, domiciled elsewhere in a
developed country, is a threat. He knows perfectly well that no matter
how important the company’s subsidiary may be to his own national
economy, it matters little to the treasurer of the multinational at
head- quarters. For Peru or India, a given subsidiary of a
multinational—the pharmaceutical subsidiary of an American company in
Peru or Hindustani Lever in India—may be a giant on which the national
economy heavily depends. But it produces at best a small percent of the
total revenue of the pharmaceutical multinational or of Unilever. In its
decisions, the central management of the multinational cannot possibly
subordinate the interest of the total company to the interests of Peru
or India. It may not willfully do damage—indeed there is no reason why
it should. But it must treat as trivial the very concerns which are
central and essential to the Peruvian or to the Indian cabinet minister
or politician.</p>
<p>And then the very qualities which make it an economic asset to the
developing country also make it a powerful competitor to the local
entrepreneur, the local business establish- ment. Both in Brazil and in
India, the local businessmen, while themselves deeply en- gaged in joint
ventures with multinationals based in Europe and in the United States,
have also been most vocal in their demand for “protection” from the
multinational, for majority ownership, or at least controlling ownership
to be in the hands of local investors, or for closing whole sectors of
the economy to the multinationals.</p>
<p>The ambivalence of the developing countries was shown dramatically by
the very dif- ferent reaction of the countries along the north and west
coasts of South America to the so-called Andean Pact which proposes, in
effect, that multinationals be strictly limited, and confined to narrow
sectors of the economy and to minority holdings.</p>
<p>Chile and Peru demanded even more stringent provisions which, in
effect, would have banished the multinationals within ten or fifteen
years. Colombia signed the pact—but with severe reservations and indeed
with the clear and declared intention of not carrying it out. Venezuela
long refused to sign at all.</p>
<p>The reason for these differences in attitude is not ideology—the
Venezuelan govern- ment was more leftist than was the Chilean at the
time (around 1968) the pact was drafted. The reason is that each country
has different multinationals. In Chile and Peru the foreign company was
still nineteenth century, as a rule: extractive industries such as
copper min- ing and petroleum, and “infrastructure” utilities such as
power and light, and telephone companies. In both countries foreigners
largely manage these businesses, and local busi- nessmen are kept out of
both management and ownership. In Colombia, the multinational</p>
<p>did not make its appearance until after World War II. It is active
mostly in manufacturing, both for the home market and for export. The
Colombia subsidiaries of the multinationals are, almost without
exception, managed by Colombians. And many are partnerships with
Colombian entrepreneurs. Venezuela, finally, eagerly wants multinational
manufacturing companies to offset its industrial oligarchy—the few
families who, as local representa- tives and confidants of the big
international petroleum companies, have come to dominate whatever
industry there is in the country. Venezuela—in part because of its oi1
reve- nues—has a large number of highly trained young men who find
opportunities seriously limited in the family-run companies of the
country and who, highly nationalist though they are, would welcome the
coming of the foreign multinationals with their career oppor- tunities
for the able man regardless of family background.</p>
<p>These examples show that it is up to the multinational and its top
management to structure the right relationship with a developing
country. The tension cannot be elimi- nated. But it can be assuaged.</p>
<p>An intelligent multinational management will, for instance, refrain
from going into businesses that will, inevitably, become a burden on the
slender foreign-exchange re- sources of a developing country or into
businesses that cannot exist unless so heavily pro- tected as to become
a burden on the country’s consuming masses.</p>
<p>It is clearly undesirable to build a manufacturing facility where the
costs—of raw ma- terials, of labor, or of capital—are so high as to make
economic operations highly prob- lematical. It is foolish to depend on
promises of governmental protection in such a case.</p>
<p>Many companies have built manufacturing plants in the smaller Latin
American coun- tries despite high factorial disadvantages and based on
promises of government protection alone. These governments, in the 1950s
and 1960s, were willing to promise almost any- thing to obtain “import
substitution.” By now most of these companies have learned that they
made a mistake. They may show the profits which a prohibitive taritf
guarantees them, but they cannot remit them. For this would damage the
country’s precarious balance of payments. A plant which can be justified
only with import substitution makes the coun- try, as a rule, actually
more import-dependent—on raw materials or on machinery. At the same time
it creates a demand for foreign exchange to service the capital
investment without creating the exports to produce the foriegn exchange.
Furthermore these compa- nies stand in danger of seeing their investment
wiped out should there be any move to- ward economic integration such as
the proposed Latin American free trade area.</p>
<p>Any investment made anywhere should be capable of survival in a
competitive mar- ket. If there is little reason to hope that within a
few years a new plant or a new business will gain competitive strength,
at least adequate to survival without protection, it should not be
started in the first place.</p>
<p>This, of course, has been known since the first protectionist theory
was developed—in the early decades of the nineteenth century, by Henry
Clay in the United States, and by his disciple, Friedrich List, in
Germany. “Infant indusiries” may need protection, may indeed deserve it.
But the purpose of such protection is to enable them to grow into
“adults” who can stand on their own feet. If that is not accomplished,
the industry will sooner or later be in trouble, no matter how great the
protectionist subsidy.</p>
<p>It can also be said that the traditional nineteenth-century pattern
of the wholly-owned subsidiary does not fit the developing countries. It
discourages rather than encourages what the country needs the most:
native investment and capital formation, and native managers and
entrepreneurs. Yet the local subsidiary must be capable of being part of
an integrated worldwide economic and business strategy. It must be
capable, for example, of specializing in making one major component for
the multinational’s plants and markets everywhere but of importing, from
the other plants of the multinational, whatever compo- nents it is not
suited to make.</p>
<p>Ford’s Mexican subsidiary, as mentioned before, specializes in making
electrical as- semblies for the Pinto. But it probably should not make
engines at all but get them from Ford’s Canadian, German, or English
plants.</p>
<p>But this then raises the very difficult problem of harmonizing the
interests of the local partners—let alone those of the local
governments—and those of the multinational sys- tem. Who makes the
optimization decisions?</p>
<p>In many developing countries the traditional congruence of capital
investment and management control needs to be re-examined. Some
developing countries can—and should—generate their own capital. Brazil
is one example. But so are, to a large extent, the Chinese territories
of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. What they need is technol- ogy,
management, and access to markets. Here management contracts rather than
owner- ship of subsidiaries may be needed.</p>
<p>Other developing countries need the capital as well but need also
either provision for eventual participation in ownership by nationals
or, from the beginning, financing other than investment by the
multinational. Otherwise the relationship will become unbearable when
the country develops.</p>
<p>The key case is, of course, Canada. That Canadian industry is so
heavily owned by foreign, and especially by U.S. companies, is the
result of Canadian decisions and actions, and especially of the
deliberate policy of the Liberal governments of Canada in the thirty
years after the Great Depression of the thirties, to channel Canadian
capital into “infra- structure” investments such as public works and
leave industrial investment to the for- eigner. The result, in economic
terms, has been a brilliant success. Canada which, in 1930, was a poor
and largely pre-industrial economy is by now one of the world’s most
highly developed and wealthiest economies. Politically the result has,
however, been un- desirable. A major economic power, which is what
Canada has become, cannot be “owned” abroad.</p>
<p>The only large company that has understood this is the American
Telephone Com- pany. At the end of World War II it owned practically all
of the two telephone companies in Canada’s most populous provinces,
Ontario and Quebec. Then it began systematically to divest itself of
share ownership to the point where these companies are now almost
entirely Canadian-owned. Yet, technically and in terms of operations,
they have remairied members of the Bell System.</p>
<p>Finally, the multinational needs to think ahead and solve the
problems which its own success will create in a developing country. As a
result of such success the country will no longer be a developing
country but, like Canada, become a developed one. At the least it will
change to the point where the old relationship becomes untenable.</p>
<p>The petroleum concession becomes untenable as it succeeds. For this
first means that a formerly dirt-poor country becomes oil-rich. It means
also that nomadic Bedouins be- come skilled mechanics, geologists, and
chemical engineers. The concession made sense in the beginning, if only
because of the enormous costs and high risks of exploration. The
petroleum-producing country still needs tbe international oil
company—perhaps more than ever. For it needs a complex and highly
expensive transportation and marketing sys- tem worldwide. But the
concession as a relationship has outlived its usefulness and be- comes a
millstone around the neck of both producing country and oil company.</p>
<p>That not one international petroleum company, at least to public
knowledge, faced up to the problem and thought through a new
relationship is a severe indictment of top man- agement.</p>
<p>The Multinational Tomorrow</p>
<p>One thing is clear: the multinational tomorrow will be different from
the multinational of today.</p>
<p>We still, substantially, have the nineteenth-century multinational
but use it to do the twentieth-century task of the transnational. We
are, in other , words in a transition period.</p>
<p>About the relationship between the multinational and political
environment, it is easier to say what will not work than what will.</p>
<p>Seen in this perspective, the Japanese policy has been realistic
despite its obvious pa- rochialism and despite the fact that it is based
on fear of the outsider, and on aversion to him rather than on any
conscious and systematic thought regarding Japan’s position in the world
economy. Japan’s policy has attempted to obtain the benefits of economic
integra- tion without the resultant dependence on, let alone domination
by, outside business. It has attempted to find new forms of integration,
e.g., the joint venture and the technical part- nership, without
relinquishing ultimate decision-making power.</p>
<p>But the Japanese policy is still focused on nineteenth-century
realities rather than on those of today. It also, for this reason, is no
longer adequate, even though in many impor- tant respects, it may more
closely foreshadow the structures of tomorrow than the mono- lithic
company, owned, controlled, and directed throughout the entire economic
world from one decision-making center.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Also untenable is the nineteenth-century pattern of foreign
domination and control of the infrastructure businesses, such as
electric power, transportation, and telephone. One reason is that the
foreigner cannot afford these investments in an inflation-prone world.
These are capital-intensive businesses. Yet they are also politically
very sensitive busi- nesses, the prices of which are everywhere under
government control. In an inflation, a foreign company will not be
allowed to raise telephone rates—only a government can get away with
this. And in an inflation a foreign company cannot raise the capital to
maintain, let alone expand, service—only a government with the power of
taxation can do this.</p></li>
<li><p>A position such as IBM has in the world’s computer industry is
not a tenable one and goes beyond the limits that will be allowed to any
one multinational company. IBM has a near-monopoly on the vital new
social function of information technology. The IBM dominance may be
overcome gradually as other businesses in the computer and informa- tion
industry grow more rapidly than IBM. This would be the most desirable
solution. Or governments in other areas, such as Western Europe and
Japan, may succeed in their at- tempts to organize their own effective
competitors to IBM. Finally, IBM may be deprived of its dominant
position by governmental fiat.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There might even be a totally new way to resolve the IBM problem. IBM
might be- come the first truly transnational public utility. It might
continue as a company enjoying worldwide leadership, if not
near-monopoly position, and yet be anchored in the eco- nomic and even
political structure of the host countries, through partnership with
local governments, local part ownership, and local regulation.</p>
<p>But one way or another the IBM dominance on a key necessity of modern
socieiy will be curbed.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Finally, multinationals will not be permitted to operate in
developing countries without thinking through the consequences of their
success as developers of the local economy and without planning ahead
for the change in the relationship that is mutually desirable.</li>
</ol>
<p>But as to what will be, one can only say that top management has the
responsibility to develop the relationships that will work—and
especially the relationships with developing countries.</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s Management Structures</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s management structure of the multinational will also be
different from to- day’s. Even within the developed countries the
multinational will have to be able to har- monize, in one structure, the
need for “polycentric” management with the need for a common business
strategy. One reason for this is the need to have the necessary
corporate flexibility to exploit whatever capital markets are most
advantageous in the form pre- ferred by each capital market.</p>
<p>The American-based multinational is already heavily owned by
Europeans. But the European investor has long preferred a convertible
debenture to outright equity invest- ment. As a result, up to 20 percent
of the equity capital of large American-based multina- tionals is
already in the form of convertible debenture, often in European
currencies and owned mainly by European institutions and investors.</p>
<p>But this might mean also the creation of European subsidiaries and
affiliated compa- nies with direct European stock ownership, of a
similar Brazilian subsidiary and affiliated companies with shares in the
hands of Brazilians, of joint ventures and similar partly owned
partnerships in Japan and other places, and so on. Organizationally what
is re- quired—and evolving—is systems management.</p>
<p>The multinational cannot hope to solve its internal problems or the
problems of its re- lationship to its political environment unless it
organizes itself as a highly disciplined, centrally directed, but
flexible, federation of equals. This is the only way in which the
president of the Colombian subsidiary of the worldwide pharmaceutical
company can be both top management and a regional sales manager. It is
the only way in which he can operate in two different roles according to
the logic and the needs of different situations. It is the only way in
which the multinational can adopt and turn to its own advantage very
different forms of relationships with different hosts and environments:
joint ventures here; partnerships there; ownership of substantial
minorities in regional or local subsidiaries by local investors;
partnership with governments in the many countries where government
enterprises are important and indeed central factors in the economy;
management con- tracts rather than ownership in certain developing
countries, and many others.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is equally clear that the multinational company
needs to be struc- tured so as to be able to manage common resources for
one world common market. One such resource is capital. Another one is
knowledge. The most important and most difficult one is managers and
professionals. Unless managers and professionals can be both “full
citizens” within the overall company and important leading members of
their own com- munities, the multinational companies will not be able to
attract and hold the kind o£ peo- ple they need. They will fail to
capitalize on what is their greatest asset: the desire of the young to
be part of a bigger world, to travel and to live in different cultures,
and to have a wide range of choices. The multinational company offers
this in a way yesterday’s domes- tic company could never do. At the same
time, it must be able to offer to the same young people, and especially
to the able young people in the developing countries, the opportu- nity
to make a contribution to their own country, their own society, their
own economy.</p>
<p>It is also reasonably clear that tomorrow’s multinational company
will have to be able to embrace within one and the same corporate
framework, and within one and the same management group, different
managerial traditions. In Japan it will have to be able to make
productive the Japanese traditions of structure, of promotion, of
management. But in Germany it will have to be a German company. It will
not only have to build its top management the way Germans expect their
top managements to be built—that is, as a team under a presiding
officer—it will also have to satisfy German notions of the proper
qualifications for management, for instance, the German valuation of an
engineering ca- reer as a preeminent preparation for top management (a
valuation which no other country shares, at least not to anything like
the same extent). In France, whether it approves of it or not, it will
have to be able to accept the French emphasis on the graduate of the
Grandes Écoles, such as the École Polytechnique, as an elite corps, and
even the French tradition under which a polytechnicien starts his career
in government service—in which he usually does not use the technical
education he has received—then around age forty- five or fifty, when at
the top of the government ladder, switches directly into the top man-
agement of major business enterprise. And in America—as most
multinational Europeans operating in this country learned long ago—top
management will have to bear the Ameri- can top-management stamp.</p>
<p>But at the same time the multinational company will have to be
unified. Its manage- ment people, even in middle management, will have
to be able to understand these differ- ences, will have to be willing to
accept them, will have to learn to respect them. Where</p>
<p>today the tendency in most multinationals is to say, “This is how we
do it in Chicago (or Munich, or Osaka, or Eindhoven),” they will have to
learn tomorrow to say, “This is what we want to achieve; how does one
get it done in Peoria (or Munich, or Osaka, or Amster- dam)?”</p>
<p>The multinational of tomorrow will inevitably have to have more than
one manage- ment team. Its corporate top management will be such a team.
But at the same time, it will be a member of a great many other
top-management teams. And in the other top manage- ments, somebody who
is not necessarily corporate top management will have to be the team
leader.</p>
<p>CPC, the American-based company already mentioned, is a first
example. Corporate top management is a team of about four or five
people. But it is also a member of top management of each of its five
companies. The president of each of these companies is the presiding
officer for the top-management team of his company, of which his own
cor- porate top management are members. They can, of course, replace
him. They certainly make the decision whom to appoint into the
presidency of each of the five companies. But with respect to his own
area, he “sits at the head of the table.” Each president, and espe-
cially the presidents of the European, Latin American, and Far Eastern
companies which preside over a large number of autonomous companies in
different countries, is in turn a member of the top-management team of
each of these companies, with the head of that company “in the
chair.”</p>
<p>This is a complex and difficult structure. It requires not only that
corporate top man- agement free itself from all operating
responsibility. It requires that management think through clearly what
its business—or businesses are and should be. It requires manage- ment
by objectives and self-control. It requires that conscience functions
are organized and made effective. It requires the highest degree of
self-discipline on the part of manag- ers and willingness to take upward
responsibility to keep higher management, and espe- cially the corporate
top management, informed, knowledgeable, and educated. It also re-
quires the “executive secretariat” or “business research staff” (Chapter
51).</p>
<p>And there is need for highly effective boards of directors, both for
the overall com- pany and for major parts, and functioning both as
review and control boards and as public and community-relations boards
(see Chapter 52).</p>
<p>But multinational management, like all systems management, also
demands personal contact, vigorous efforts on the top to create and to
maintain communications, and will- ingness both to learn and to teach.
It cannot be run by “systems,” though it requires a high degree of it.
Like its prototype in the NASA “systems management” (Chapter 47), top
management in such a structure has to be free to spend time with people,
and not only with the top people. It has to make sure that every
decision maker in the structure knows what goes on and not only within
his own unit. It has to make sure that people pretty far down the line
understand and that they in turn help top management understand. This
requires that the people in New York or in Basel have enough time to sit
down with their associates in São Paulo or Sydney—not with a problem,
not with their own concerns, but as learners, as listeners, as resource.
It similarly requires that the top-management people, the members of the
corporate top-management team as well as the members of all other
top-management teams down to the smallest local company, have time for
direct personal relationships with important groups in their
environment: the government people, the po- litical leadership, the
opinion-makers, whether in the communications media or in the
universities. They cannot hope to reconcile the cleavage between the
reality of a world economy and the reality of national sovereign states.
But it is their job to make it bear- able.</p>
<p>The multinational company is surely the most important economic
instrument in to- day’s world. It is important precisely because it
reflects the new reality of a world market and of a world economy. It is
important because it is the most effective tool for optimiz- ing the
economic resources available. But precisely because it reflects a new
reality rather than the extension of yesterday’s business, it also
requires new structures, new methods of integration, and new
relationships. The multinational company is still new enough to be</p>
<p>crippled. If so, the world would be the poorer. And the greatest
sufferers would be pre- cisely those developing countries which are, at
the same time, most afraid of the multina- tional company, most
conscious of the disparity between its strength and their own weak-
ness, most in need of psychological, but also of economic, security and
identity. But to make the multinational corporation live up to its
promise requires innovative work of high quality from its top
managements.</p>

<p>ROWTH IS NOT AUTOMATIC. It does not follow from success. Of course it
re- quires having the right products or services for the right markets
at the right time. But this is a prerequisite for growth, a necessary
condition, rather than growth itself.</p>
<p>Growth of a social organism such as a business is as much stress and
strain as growth is in a biological organism. It is discontinuity. At
one stage a business must change itself. And at that stage there is
usually the kind of identity crisis of which the modern psycholo- gists
speak when they analyze the transition from adolescence to adulthood. As
with hu- man beings, the ablest, the brightest, the most highly
motivated seem to suffer the worst identity crisis.</p>
<p>The best example is the story of IBM’s “near-miss.”</p>
<p>IBM’s Near-Miss</p>
<p>In retrospect, IBM’s rise from a fair-sized 00 million business
around 1950 to the billion computer colossus of the early 1970s seemed
smooth, trouble-free, and all but preordained. Actually, IBM went
through a severe identity crisis. It almost missed the computer
opportunity. It became capable of growth only through a palace coup
which overthrew Thomas J. Watson, Sr., the company’s founder, its chief
executive, and for long years the prophet of “data processing.”</p>
<p>Yet, if any company should have been able to grow smoothly and
without trouble, it was IBM. No other company in American business
history was so carefully prepared for growth, trained for growth, and
directed toward growth. And it was, from the beginning, to be growth in
data processing.</p>
<p>Thomas J. Watson, Sr., started before World War I by buying the
patents for the punch card, to which he added later patents for a time
clock. To convert the patents into a business proved painfully slow and
difficult. When World War II started, IBM was still a small and
struggling company, occupying a limited niche in the business equipment
field.</p>
<p>But long before IBM had established itself even in this small niche
Watson had begun to prepare the company for growth and for becoming a
big, indeed a very big, enterprise. He adopted a grandiose name,
International Business Machines, at a time when IBM was neither
international nor truly business machines. Long before any other
American com- pany thought of such things—even before Adriano Olivetti,
having inherited a small</p>
<p>typewriter company in northern Italy, adopted a similar course—IBM
created a company image through distinctive design and distinctive
typography for its products, its publica- tions, and its communications
inside and outside the company. Watson invented the slo- gan “THINK” and
distributed hundreds of thousands of “THINK” posters and stickers to
employees and customers.</p>
<p>From very early days Watson developed and trained a human
organization that would look upon itself as an elite corps and be
prepared to manage a very much bigger business. As has already been
related (in Chapter 20) he insisted that his workers take responsibility
for their own work and thus trained a whole cadre of proud and competent
men who be- came the skeleton around which the much bigger IBM work
force of later years was built.</p>
<p>Above all, Watson trained, and trained, and trained. All employees
were expected to continue to learn while on the job. But for the men who
were considered “IBM’s busi- ness”—that is, for salesmen, servicemen,
and sales managers, continuous training was a way of life.</p>
<p>The district sales managers, in particular, were trained to be top
executives. Not one of these men had technical education or technical
background. Yet when in the fifties and sixties the company switched to
advanced electronics from a mechanical appliance, the punch-card
sorter—in many cases still operated by hand or at the most by the
simplest of electrical motors—these technically unschooled men became
the management that built the world’s leading computer company. Having
grown up in continuous training, they had learned to learn. Into the
1970s, IBM’s top management was primarily staffed with former punch-card
district managers.</p>
<p>From early days Watson saw the future of IBM in what he may have been
the first to call data processing. He was convinced all along that the
day would come when a ma- chine would take over the tedious job of
handling large masses of data speedily, reliably, and at low cost.</p>
<p>Watson therefore saw at once what no one else at the time realized:
that the computer market would be in business. He saw that the key to
the computer business was not tech- nology but marketing. He saw that
what mattered was not what the computer could do but what the user could
get from it. On these basic insights IBM’s rise to dominance in the
computer field essentially rests—and they were Thomas J. Watson, Sr.’s
insights.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that Watson was an autocrat. He has been
harshly criticized for the conformity he imposed on his organization,
for his heavy-handed paternalism, and for his narrow prejudices. Yet, as
subsequent events showed, he did not stifle, let alone break, the
managerial people in his organization. Whatever his shortcomings—and
they were great—he had, from early days, a clear vision of the goal, and
the ability to think through what policies, what basic attitude, what
strategy would be required.</p>
<p>And yet Thomas Watson, Sr., almost destroyed the very opportunity he
had waited for, worked for, and built for. When the computer finally
arrived, and with it the realiza- tion of Watson’s dreams, he suddenly
did not want growth. He began to dither. He was afraid of doing anything
that might hurt the company’s punch-card business. And of course the
computer threatened—or seemed to threaten—the punch-card business alto-
gether. He began to sabotage manufacturing developments and selling
efforts that might replace existing or potential punch-card
installations; and that, of course, meant that he sabotaged all computer
development and all computer selling. He had been almost sin- fully
proud of his key people, and especially of his elite group, the district
sales managers. Now he suddenly felt that not one of them was “ready”
for a bigger or different job.</p>
<p>Above all, he refused to change his own behavior. He did not want to
become the chief executive officer of a big business. He was determined
to remain the owner of a small one. He did not want to let other people,
including his own two sons, take on any responsibility of their own or
make any decisions. He resisted anything that would have impaired in the
slightest degree his direct personal control of every aspect of the
business, or that would have made it difficult for him to know in great
detail everything that was going on. He stubbornly and with great
determination held on to a relationship to his company as his “own
child” and as an extension of his own personality.</p>
<p>Judging by the experience of other companies, Watson would have
destroyed IBM’s opportunity for growth had he remained at the head of
the company much longer. Even a few years’ delay would have been fatal.
By then, that is, in the early fifties, the first im- portant customers
would have bought computers and would have thereby designated the
leading companies. The first major new technical developments would have
had to be made beyond the early crude models. Considering how innocent
of technology Thomas Watson’s IBM was—the first engineer was not even
hired until the late thirties, and then for production engineering and
not for design—IBM could hardly have leap-frogged di- rectly into the
“second generation” computers of the early fifties in which transistors
re- placed vacuum tubes and electronic switches replaced mechanical
drives. If Watson had been permitted to stay for a few years, IBM would
at best have become an “also ran” in the computer business—and probably
not even that. It surely would not have become the leader in data
processing, for which he had prepared the company.</p>
<p>But then providence intervened in the highly improbable guise of the
Anti-Trust Divi- sion of the U.S. Department of Justice. At the very
moment when punch cards were losing their importance, the Anti-Trust
Division brought suit against IBM for allegedly monopo- lizing the
punch-card field. The one thing of which Watson was mortally afraid was
an antitrust suit. When still a young man, in the early years of the
century, an antitrust suit had almost destroyed him. Having been made a
scapegoat for serious antitrust violations of his earlier associates at
the National Cash Register Company, he had been sentenced to a stiff
term in jail and was rescued only by a presidential pardon. His panic
made it possi- ble for his closest associates, led by his two sons, to
force him to abdicate. The sons at once built a top-management team.
They concentrated the key resources, and especially the men Watson had
trained, on their new business. And within three years IBM emerged as
the leader.</p>
<p>The only thing that is atypical about the IBM story is the happy
ending. In the great majority of cases, the growing company that runs
into an identity crisis succumbs to it. In the great majority of cases
it loses its opportunity, no matter how badly it wants to grow— or says
it wants to grow. In the great majority of cases, the business then
remains stunted. Money is spent. Plans are made. But there are no
results. Instead of growth there is frus- tration.</p>
<p>And few companies manage to escape such an identity crisis.</p>
<p>At the Ford Motor Company the point where the company had to become a
big busi- ness arose during World War I. At that time Henry Ford’s
closest associates, his partner James Couzens and his brother-in-law and
financial advisor Ernest Kanzler, urged Ford to change the structure of
the company and the way in which he himself ran it. But Ford pushed both
men out of the company. Almost immediately the Ford Motor Company be-
gan to decline. Five years later it had been overtaken by GM, and
another five years later, toward the end of the twenties; it lost even
its number two position to a brash newcomer, Walter P. Chrysler, who,
apparently on Alfred Sloan’s advice, had organized his fledgling company
as a big business from the start.</p>
<p>Siemens (as was told in Chapter 29) went through a similar crisis
after the death of the founder when his sons refused to adopt the
structure, management, and policies appropri- ate to the big company
Siemens had become. Had they been allowed to go on, Siemens might well
not have survived, at least not as a major and important business.</p>
<p>ATandandandandT, the Bell Telephone Company, went through a similar
trauma. By the late 1890s, ATandandandandT had reached the point when it
could no longer be run as a financial holding company for a large number
of small and local telephone businesses. It had to become a large and
national company. Theodore N. Vail saw this clearly. He was then about
fifty and the company’s general manager, with the title of president.
But the company’s chief executives were a small group of Boston
investment bankers. When Vail came to them with his plans and proposals,
they refused to listen and forced him into early retirement. Ten years
later, however, their refusal to build the management the company
required had so weakened ATandandandandT that nationalization seemed
almost inevitable. The Bostonians then ate humble pie and implored Vai1
to come back and take over, this time with full power.</p>
<p>Within a few years Vai1 built the new structure of a big company
which enabled the Bell Telephone System to become the world’s biggest
privately owned business.</p>
<p>The most instructive example might, however, be Sears, Roebuck.
Richard Sears, whose name the company still bears, had pioneered many of
the fundamental policies on which the success of Sears is based to this
day. But when the company grew from a very small to a fair-sized
business, Sears refused to change the company and to change himself. As
a result, in the early years of the century, he nearly went bankrupt and
was forced to sell to a total outsider, Julius Rosenwald, a Chicago
clothing merchant. Rosenwald imme- diately organized a top-management
team and structured a big company. And Sears, Roe- buck, almost moribund
under its founder, started to grow. Twenty years later Rosenwald himself
realized that the company and its management needed to make another
quantum jump. Sears, already a big company, had to be ready to become a
very much bigger one. He turned to a total outsider, General Robert E.
Wood, who had proven his administrative capacity as quartermaster in
charge of supply for the American Army during World War I, and had then
become merchandising vice-president at Sears’s arch-rival, Montgomery
Ward. For a year or two Rosenwald watched from the sidelines. Then he
turned over the top job to Wood and withdrew, taking his own management
group with him.</p>
<p>In order to grow, as these stories show, there is need for strategy.
There is need for preparation. There is need for establishing an ideal
of behavior focused on what one wants to become. But none of this is of
much avail unless top management is willing to make the change. Even
great vision and high resolve will otherwise lead only to frustra- tion
and futility.</p>
<p>Is Growth Necessary?</p>
<p>The 1950s and especially the 1960s indulged in a veritable “growth
craze” in economy as well as in business. Growth was what the investor
was looking for to put his money in. Growth—on the order of “10 percent
growth in sales and 10 percent growth in profit each year”—was what
managements promised. And growth also was the focus of economics, both
in the developing and in the developed countries. In large measure this
was a reac- tion to the stagnation that had characterized world economy
and business in the period between the two World Wars. Then growth
seemed to have stopped. The best anyone could hope for was protection
against debilitating depression and decline. When the black mood of
frustration lifted after World War II, it was a tremendous relief. The
zest with which economy after economy and company after company
rediscovered growth was very healthy.</p>
<p>But the growth craze soon went too far. And where, before 1940, we
had believed the myth of stagnation, we soon began to believe myths
about growth. It is simply not true that an exponential rate of growth
can be maintained for long periods, let alone forever. A business that
grows at an exponential rate—let alone at so high a rste as the much-
proclaimed 10 percent each year—would soon gobble up the world and all
its resources. Growth at a high rate and for an extended period is also
anything but healthy. It makes a business—or any institution—exceedingly
vulnerable. It makes it all but impossible to manage it properly. It
creates stresses, weaknesses, and hidden defects which, at the first
slight setback, become major crises.</p>
<p>Even from the purely financial point of view of the investor
interested in capital gains, the growth company is not a sound
investment. Such a company sooner or later—and usually sooner—runs into
real difficulties. Sooner or later it runs into tremendous losses, has
to write off vast sums, and becomes, in effect, unmanageable. It takes
years then for such a company to regain its health and its capacity to
grow again and to produce profit. There are few exceptions to the rule
that today’s growth company is tomorrow’s problem.</p>
<p>The same vulnerability characterizes the “growth industry.” Indeed
the dynamics of a growth industry are perfectly well known—and they make
the growth industry a poor investment except for the most knowledgeable.
In the growth industry there is first the opening up of a new major area
of economic activity which promises to offer tremendous</p>
<p>opportunities. Any entrant into this new area of activity seems to be
doing very well. As a result, a great many new entrants clamor to get
into the act. Soon the industry is over- crowded. Inevitably there is
then a “shake-out.” Where there were thirty or forty entrants, only five
or six, maybe seven or eight, remain. Of these, three or four assume
leadership and retain it for many decades. Another three or four manage
to become respectable fair- sized businesses, occupying small but
distinct niches. The rest disappear.</p>
<p>But which companies will emerge as leaders in this process and which
will disappear is unpredictable. Even the insider has little chance to
guess correctly. The decisive factor is well hidden. It is, above all,
the capacity of a company’s management to manage for growth and to
develop the strategy that will give it leadership position in the
shake-out.</p>
<p>One example is the U.S. chemical industry in the period of its most
rapid growth, that is, in the twenties, when it first emerged as a major
American industry. Anyone who then tried to pick a winner would have
chosen Allied Chemical, which emerged from World War I as a very big
company with an almost impregnable patent position in the major areas.
It would have been a very rash man indeed at that time who picked either
Du Pont or Dow. These were, at best, minor companies in fringe areas
such as explosives or metal- lurgy. Yet Allied Chemical never succeeded
in building on its strengths. It had neither management nor strategy,
and floundered. Du Pont and Dow emerged as leaders.*</p>
<p>Similarly, few people in the early stages of the growth of the
American pharmaceuti- cal industry in the late 1940s and 1950s would
have been likely to pick the two companies that emerged as the winners
and as leaders in the industry, Merck and Pfizer. The former was
marginal, with no apparent strength in pharmaceutical research and
limited to a few rather unexciting patent medicines. The latter was not
even in the pharmaceutical industry but had been, for all of its long
and up till then undistinguished history, a local manufac- turer of
yeast for the New York breweries. In retrospect—but only in
retrospect—it is clear that these two companies had a strategy for
growth, and a management willing to structure a big company and change
irs own behavior.</p>
<p>The securities market would be well advised to put a discount on
growth stocks and growth industries rather than a premium. For growth is
a risk.</p>
<p>The idea that growth is by itself a goal is altogether a delusion.
There is no virtue in a company’s getting bigger. The right goal is to
become better. Growth, to be sound, should be the result of doing the
right things. By itself, growth is vanity and little else.</p>
<p>Growth in the Public-Service Institution</p>
<p>Growth crazes in the business world are a recurrent disease; in the
last century they have swept America, for instance, three times (in the
1870s, in the 1920s—at a time when Europe was in the grip of a
“stagnation craze”—and in the 1960s.) In public-service insti- tutions,
and especially in government agencies, the growth craze is, however,
endemic and permanent. This (as discussed in Chapter 12) is in large
part the result of dependence on a budget which makes the large staff
and the large budget the one generally accepted measurement of
performance, success and importance.</p>
<p>But bigger is also not necessarily better in a service institution,
whether a hospital, a government agency, a university—or in the
personnel staff in a business, or in its research laboratory.</p>
<p>The best example of the lack of any correlation between size and
performance in ser- vice institutions may be the two American
philanthropic foundations which respectively were first in size in the
decades before and the decades after World War II: the Rockefel- ler
Foundation and the Ford Foundation. By present-day standards the
resources of the pre-World War II Rockefeller Foundation were quite
modest—well below one billion</p>
<p>*Even the Du Pont management did not consider its company to be a
growth company at that time. The deci- sion to invest a large part of
the profits the company had made during World War I in General
Motors—which then, a few years later, led to GM’s reorganization and
subsequent rise—was made because the Du Pont top management (and
especially Pierre du Pont, the company’s chief executive) did not see
much growth opportu- nity for their company in their own industry.</p>
<p>dollars. Ford, by contrast, had almost three billions to spend. But
its limited resources forced the Rockefeller Foundation to keep its
staff small and to concentrate. Its impacts, as a result, were very
substantial—both in the field of medicine and in the sciences. Ford, by
contrast, was almost forced by the heavy weight of all the sums it had
to spend to look for projects that would absorb the most money—and how
much impact any Ford Founda- tion project has had so far is a matter of
considerable controversy.</p>
<p>But growth is also just as demanding and difficult in the
public-service institution as it is in a business. The larger budget may
make possible taking on new and important tasks—though often enough it
means only doing more of the things that need not be done at all. It
always, however, also means taking in people who have to be trained,
directed, supervised, and managed. It means additional complexities.
Above all, growth in the pub- lic service institution—including the
service staffs in businesses—also means that top management has to
change.</p>
<p>The public-service institution needs to pay the greatest attention to
“weight control”</p>
<p>(as said earlier, in Chapters 13 and 14). It is particularly prone to
mistake fat for muscle, weight for importance, and busyness for
achievement. But it also needs to know how to manage growth. And the
approaches to managing growth are essentially the same whether the
growing institution is a business or a service institution. For managing
growth is a top- management challenge and a top-management task and
requires, therefore, top- management strategy and top-management
organization.</p>
<p>Growth as a Survival Need</p>
<p>The growth craze had to come to an end like every mania. And yet
growth will continue to be a desirable and indeed a necessary business
objective. Even if the economy, as so many were predicting in the early
seventies, would turn to zero growth—thus returning, in effect, to the
stagnation of the twenties and thirties—there would be need for
management to understand how to manage growth. For, as the example of
the twenties and thirties clearly shows, a period of zero growth in the
economy is not one of stability. It is one of turbulence.</p>
<p>In a growing economy there is plenty of room. Industries that have
passed their peak decline slowly and are being held up by the overall
buoyancy of the economy. New indus- tries can grow fast. But there is
still room for those that do not know how to grow well and grow more by
accident than by management.</p>
<p>But when the economy as such does not grow, changes in the economy
are bound to be abrupt and sharp. Then indeed a company or an industry
that does not grow will de- cline. Then there is even more need for a
strategy that enables a management to plan for growth and to manage
growth.</p>
<p>Whether we are at the end of economic growth and will have to learn
to live in a “solid state economy”—if only because of the limitations of
the environment and of its resources—is not within the scope of this
book to discuss. It is not the most probable forecast, given the fact
that two-thirds of mankind still live in abject poverty. But growth in
the future may well mean different things. It may mean using fewer
resources, that is, a shift to growth in knowledge industries rather
than in manufacturing. Costs will be differ- ent; what we considered
free goods, such as air and water, will be anything but free and will
have a high cost attached to them. The pattern of development in
tomorrow’s fast- developing countries may well differ significantly from
the traditional nineteenth-century pattern with its emphasis on steel,
which still underlay the explosive growth of Japan after World War II
and the growth of Brazil in the sixties. Undoubtedly there will be
increasing need to guard and maintain the balance between what man takes
out of his environment and what he puts back. This alone will make
growth opportunities different in the future from what they have been in
the past.</p>
<p>But there will also be new factors pressing for growth. One that is
usually overlooked is the expectation of the young, educated people.</p>
<p>A company that is not able to attract, motivate, and hold men of
talent end compe-</p>
<p>The Need for Growth Objectives</p>
<p>But the collapse of the growth craze of the sixties showed that it is
not enough for a man- agement to say, “We want growth.” A management
needs a rational growth policy. A management needs objectives that are
based on more solid grounds than the desire to grow or the promise to
grow.</p>
<p>Management needs to think through the minimum of growth which its
company re- quires. What is the minimum of growth without which the
company would actually lose strength, vigor, and ability to perform, if
not to survive?</p>
<p>A company needs a viable market standing. Otherwise it soon becomes
marginal. It soon becomes, in effect, the wrong size. And if the market
expands, whether domestically or worldwide, a company has to grow with
the market to maintain its viability. At times a company therefore needs
a very high minimum growth rate.</p>
<p>In the pharmaceutical market or in the computer market in the fifties
and sixties, when the total market expanded at a fast clip, to stay even
meant very fast growth. In the textile industry in the developed
countries, there was little net overall growth of the market in the same
period (though more than is commonly believed). Here minimum growth
consisted primarily of identifying the most promising market segments
and of concentrating on them.</p>
<p>In GE’s strategic business planning (see Chapter 10) the first
question is not “What markets have the greatest growth potential?” It is
rather “What is the minimum growth of each market? Can we expect to keep
up with it? What market segments (even in the slow- growth markets)
offer the best opportunities for us?”</p>
<p>Growth in the context of a business is an economic rather than a
physical term. Vol- ume, by itself, is irrelevant. To use up more wood
each year may be a rational objective for the Gypsy Moth. It is an inane
objective for a paper company. What matters in a busi- ness—whether it
operates in a market economy or in any other economic system—is eco-
nomic performance, as measured by contribution to economy and society;
by productivity of resources—men, capital, materials; and by
profitability. A business grows if it grows in economic performance and
economic results. To want to be a “billion-dollar company” is not a
rational growth objective. Growth objectives have to be economic
objectives rather than volume objectives.</p>
<p>This is particularly important as the most dangerous mistake is to
confuse growth with putting on fat. A business actually grows if it
sloughs off activities which do not contrib- ute. Such activities only
drain. They impede the true growth potential. The second step,
therefore, in GE’s strategic business planning is to ask whether this or
that activity of the company should be closed down, sold, or at least
de-emphasized. When GE began to ask this question in the late sixties it
regained its capacity to grow after long years of relative
stagnation.</p>
<p>The second growth objective needed is an optimum objective. What is
the combina- tion of activities, products, and businesses that promises
to produce the best balance be- tween risk and return on resources? What
is the point, in other words, at which increased market standing can be
obtained only at a cost in productivity of every major resource and</p>
<p>of all resources, altogether? What is the point beyond which greater
profitability could be obtained only by a steep increase in risk? But
what also is the point below which a de- crease in risk is likely to
sharply curtail productivity and profitability—and also to endan- ger
market position?</p>
<p>It is this optimum point, rather than a maximum, which determines the
upper range of a company’s growth goals. Growth should be at least the
minimum growth. But it should, as a rule, not exceed the optimum.
Indeed, growth that exceeds the optimum, that is, growth that purchases
market position at the price of lower productivity, or growth that
purchases higher productivity at a price in market position, is
basically unsound and can- not be sustained. It is the growth that leads
to the costly “surprises” in the “growth com- pany.” It is the growth
that creates vulnerabilities, flaws, overextension, lack of control and,
fairly soon, a major, if not a fatal, setback.</p>
<p>A growth policy, in other words, is a business policy. It does not
differ from any other business policy. It requires objectives, it
requires priorities, it requires strategy. Above all, it requires that
growth goals be rational and grounded in the objective reality of a
busi- ness, of its markets, of its technologies, rather than in
financial fantasy.</p>
<p>The Need to Prepare for Growth</p>
<p>Growth requires internal preparation. Because IBM had prepared for
growth for many years, it was able to take off as soon as the dead hand
of the past had been removed. Without such preparation even the desire
to grow, even the understanding of what was needed for growth in the new
computer industry, would hardly have sufficed to turn, al- most
overnight, a maker of simple products without much engineering content
into the leader in a technically advanced industry.</p>
<p>When the opportunity for rapid growth will come in the life of a
company cannot be predicted. But a company has to be ready. If a company
is not ready, opportunity moves on and knocks at somebody else’s
door.</p>
<p>The IBM story shows that a company, to be able to grow, must, within
itself, create an atmosphere of continuous learning. It must be managed
in such manner that all its mem- bers—down to the lowest-ranking
employees—are willing and ready to take on new, dif- ferent, and bigger
responsibilities as a matter of course, and without trepidation. A com-
pany can grow only to the extent to which its people can grow.</p>
<p>Of course—at least in the West—one can bring in this or that expert,
this or that spe- cialist, this or that capacity, competence, or talent.
But fundamentally growth, even growth by acquisition (as has been said
earlier) has to come from within and has to be based on the strengths of
a company. A growth policy requires that a human organization establish
the atmosphere of continuous learning and acquire the readiness to do
different and bigger things.</p>
<p>Financial planning for the demands of a bigger business is also
needed. Otherwise, when growth comes, the company will find itself in a
financial crisis that is likely to frus- trate growth. This applies to
the small, but also to the fair-sized, business (see Chapter 54 on the
needs of the small and the fair-sized company). For even fairly moderate
growth soon outruns the financial foundations of a business. It soon
creates financial demands in areas to which no one, as a rule, has paid
much attention. It soon makes obsolete capital structure or existing
arrangements for obtaining short-term loans and working capital.
Financial strategy is essential to growth—as essential as product
strategy, technological strategy, or market strategy. But the key to the
ability to grow is a human organization that is capable of growth.</p>
<p>Top Management: The Controlling Factor</p>
<p>The controlling factor in managing growth is top management—again a
lesson of the IBM story. For a company to be able to grow, top
management must be willing and able to change itself, its role, its
relationship, and its behavior.</p>
<p>This is easily said—and very hard to accomplish. The very people—and
usually, the very man—of whom such change is demanded are also as a rule
the people to whom the success of the company so far can be attributed.
Now, when success is within their grasp, they are asked to abandon the
behavior that has produced it. They are asked to give up the habits of a
lifetime. They are asked—or so it seems to them—to abdicate their
leadership position. They are asked, above all, to hand over their
“child” to others. For growth al- ways requires that the management of
one man—or of a small handful of men—be re- placed by a genuine
top-management team.</p>
<p>Most top-management people in the growth company which somehow does
not seem to be growing—that is, in the great majority of small and
fair-sized companies with growth potential—know rationally what is
needed. But, like Watson, they lack the will to change.</p>
<p>Top management therefore has to start preparing itself for growth at
a very early stage. Specifically, it has to take three steps:</p>
<p>• It has to define the key activities and build, in effect, a budding
top- management team to take care of them.</p>
<p>• It has to be aware of the symptoms of the need for change in basic
policy, structure, and behavior so that it knows when the time for
change has arrived.</p>
<p>• It has to be honest with itself and decide whether it really wants
to change or not.</p>
<p>IBM worked for long years on making itself look like a big company,
internally as well as externally. It worked on its appearance to the
outside world, in the design of its products and in the design of all
the graphics with which it communicated to its own peo- ple and to the
outside world. It did not spend a great deal of money on advertising and
promotion. But when it did, it tried to make a “big splash.”</p>
<p>But at the same time, IBM was run internally on a basis of managerial
austerity. There were no staffs. There was no research and development.
There were no vice-presidents of this and that. There was a top man,
Thomas Watson. There was a strong field sales or- ganization. And there
was, as the only staff officer, an educational director. Even engi-
neering was unknown until the late thirties—which seems almost
unbelievable today.</p>
<p>IBM, in other words, had analyzed its key activities. It supplied
them with resources far in excess of what seemed appropriate to the
small company IBM still was in the late thirties and early forties. But
it did not do anything else.</p>
<p>There is a paradox to growth. “If You want to be a big company
tomorrow, You have to start acting like one today” is said to have been
Thomas Watson’s favorite aphorism. The company that wants to be able to
grow has to support the key activities or the level on which they will
be needed after the growth has taken place. Otherwise it will lack
compe- tence, ability, and strength in the areas in which it needs them
the most. But at the same time, such a company does not have the
resources. Only by starving all but the truly es- sential can it balance
the conflicting requirements of the present business, i.e., a business
with very limited resources, and those of the business of tomorrow,
i.e., a business that will demand fairly heavy support in major
areas.</p>
<p>One way in which the chief executive of a small or fair-sized
business that has growth ambitions can prepare himself for the day when
the company will have outgrown man- agement by one man is to build a
top-management team at the earliest possible moment. The one way in
which he himself can learn to be a true manager, rather than “the boss,”
is by analyzing first the key activities the business needs and his own
personality. There will always be key activities that do not fit the top
man, key activities which others can do better—and then others should do
them.</p>
<p>When Rosenwald took over Sears he analyzed the key activities and
built a top- management team of three people. As long as he stayed in
the company, he was the un- disputed leader and chief executive. But
from the beginning, decisions on the location,</p>
<p>organization, and layout of the mail-order plants—a key activity for
Sears in those days— were made by Otto Doering and not by Julius
Rosenwald. Basic decisions on finance and personnel were made by Albert
Loeb. Rosenwald was close to every decision. He did not hesitate to
express his opinion and occasionally to overrule his associates. But
these men, even in the fairly small company which Sears was in the early
days, were “associates” and not “subordinates.”</p>
<p>Similarly, the first thing George Merck of Merck andandandand Co. did
when, at the end of World War II, he decided that the pharmaceutical
industry would grow very rapidly and that his company would be a major
factor in it was to bring in Vannevar Bush as chairman of the board, and
as an associate. Merck knew that he and his company were innocent of
basic scientific knowledge and organized research. But he also knew that
this was a key activ- ity.</p>
<p>The top man—or the top men—in a company that has ambitions to grow
has to know when the time for a change has come. He has to know the
symptoms that indicate that a company has outgrown its traditional
structure, its traditional management behavior, and, above all, the
traditional role of the top man.</p>
<p>There is one reliable symptom.</p>
<p>The top man in a company—especially in a small or fair-sized company
that has been growing fast—is typically exceedingly proud of the men who
work with him. And yet— and this is the infallible symptom of the need
for change—not one of the “boys” is “quite ready yet.” When the time for
change comes, he always finds good reasons for not mov- ing this man to
that bigger responsibility, for not turning over a key area to another
man, and so on. He always says “so and so is the best man—but he is not
quite ready.” This is a clear indication that the top man himself is not
ready.</p>
<p>The chief executive, the top man, in the small and fair-sized—but
also in the big— company that wants to grow has to impose on himself a
change in his own role, behavior, and relationships.</p>
<p>The resistance of the top man to change is often blamed on his age.
Ford and Thomas Watson, Sr., were indeed well along in years when their
companies outgrew the way they were managing them; Ford was in his
sixties, Watson in his seventies. But the resistance to the change in
behavior, goal, and relationship which growth elicits from the top man
can be just as great among younger men. The Siemens sons were young men;
for instance; and so were the Boston bankers who blocked Vail at the
Bell Telephone System in the 1890s. On the other hand, many older men
are capable of imposing change on them- selves. Julius Rosenwald was
past sixty when he decided to bring in General Wood and step down. So
was George Merck when he decided his own role had to change.</p>
<p>A company may even be fortunate to have an old or aging chief
executive when the time for change in his role and behavior arrives. It
is much easier to get a man in his six- ties or seventies to step down
gracefully than to force out a man in his prime who is un- willing to
change.</p>
<p>What is demanded of the top man is indeed a great deal. He has to
accept that he no longer can be the virtuoso performer. Instead he has
to become the “conductor.” Where he prides himself, as did Thomas
Watson, Sr., on knowing everybody in the company, on knowing every
customer, on knowing everything that went on, and on making every deci-
sion and solving every problem, he now has to manage by objectives for
managers and through their self-control. Where formerly he was the court
of last resort—and very often the court of first resort as, well—he now
has to have a management structure. Where he “knows how to do
everything,” he now has to let people do it their own way.</p>
<p>To expect of anybody that he can make such a change suddenly is to
expect the mira- cle of conversion. And even conversions in retrospect
always have a long history of preparation. The top man who wants his
business to grow has to accept the role which he will have to play in
the bigger business long before it becomes a necessity.</p>
<p>First, he has to think through whether he really wants his company to
grow, and whether it is really capable of growth. A great deal can be
said for the “middle class” in business as well as in society. Not to be
a big company is often more enjoyment, more</p>
<p>satisfaction, and certainly, for the people at the top, a great deal
more personal achieve- ment and persona1 freedom. There is no reason to
believe that Luxembourg or Switzer- land is less happy, less achieving,
or less valuable to humanity than today’s superpower.</p>
<p>No company needs to strive to be “bigger” beyond the minimum growth
needed to stay abreast of its market. Growth beyond this must be based
on capacity to contribute. But a company that decides that it is happy
in its niche, satisfied with the contribution it makes and the market it
serves, and content with doing a good job is not, by this token, a “less
good” or a “less valuable” company. In economic terms it may well be—and
often is—a far more productive company than the giant. Growth as a goal,
to repeat, is delu- sion. William James, the American philosopher,
talked of the “bitch goddess success.” A philosopher of business today
might well talk of the “bitch goddess growth.”</p>
<p>But even if the top man decides that his company needs growth, he
still has a second question—and a more difficult one: “Do I want growth
of the business for myself?”</p>
<p>Thomas Watson apparently knew that he did not want to work in a big
company, even though his whole life was spent in building one. He
lacked, however, the wisdom or the strength of character to face the
consequences. Julius Rosenwald apparently did not. He realized that he
did not want to run a giant company. He also knew that Sears could and
should become one—and he knew the correct conclusions for himself.</p>
<p>The top man who concludes that his company needs to grow but who also
then real- izes that he does not want to change himself and his behavior
has, in conscience, only one line of action open to him. He has to step
aside. Even if he legally owns the company, he does not own the lives of
other people. A company is not a child—and even with a human child, the
time comes when the parent has to accept that the child has grown up and
needs to be independent and on his own.</p>
<p>A business is a human achievement. And a business, no matter what its
legal owner- ship, is a trust. The top-management man who realizes that
he does not want to change also realizes that he will stifle, stunt, and
throttle the very thing he has loved and built, his business. If he
cannot face up to the demands of his own achievement, he owes it to him-
self and to his company to step aside.</p>

“Business” Rather Than a “Function” — The Team—The Innovating Unit as an
Entrepreneur—The Challenge of the Innova- tive Organization</p>
<p>THE NEED TO INNOVATE is mentioned—indeed emphasized—in every book on
management. But beyond this the books, as a rule, pay little attention
to what man- agement and organization need to be and need to do to
stimulate, to direct, and to make effective innovation. Most discussions
stress, almost exclusively, the administrative function of management,
that is, the task of keeping going and of improving what is al- ready
known and what is already largely being done. Little thought or space is
normally devoted to the entrepreneurial function of creating effectively
and purposefully the new and the different.</p>
<p>In this neglect of the management of innovation, the books only
mirror business real- ity. Every management stresses the need to
innovate. But few, in the large as well as the small businesses,
organize innovation as a distinct and major task. To be sure, since
World War II, “research” has become fashionable. Large sums of money are
being spent on it. But in many companies the outcome has been
improvement rather than innovation.</p>
<p>This is even more true of the public-service institutions.</p>
<p>There were good reasons in the past for the focus on the
administrative function to the neglect of innovation. When management
first became a concern, in the early years of this century, the great
and new need was to learn how to organize, structure, and direct the
large-scale human organization which was suddenly coming into being.
Innovation inso- far as it received attention was seen as a separate
job, a job done by the individual by himself, by the “inventor” of the
nineteenth century. Or it was seen as a predominantly technical job,
that of research.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was not too much scope for innovation in the years
from 1920 to 1950 when most of the basic work on management was being
done. For contrary to com- mon belief, these were not years of rapid
change, either in technology or in society. They were (as was stressed
in Chapter 3) years in which, by and large, technology built on
foundations that had been laid before World War I. And while they were
years of tremen- dous political turbulence, social and economic
institutions were stagnant. Indeed, the same can be said for social and
economic ideas. The great revolutionary ideas which have been at work in
the last fifty years are those of thinkers living, or at least rooted,
in the nineteenth century, such as Marx, Darwin, and Freud. Even Keynes,
no matter how inno-</p>
<p>vative he was, built on foundations which such economists of the late
nineteenth century as Leon Walras and Alfred Marshall had already put
securely in place.</p>
<p>Now, however, we may be entering a period of rapid change more
comparable in its basic features to the closing decades of the
nineteenth century than to the immediate past with which we are
familiar. In the late nineteenth century, as we need to remind
ourselves, a new major invention leading almost immediately to the
emergence of a new major in- dustry, surfaced every few months on
average. This period began in 1856, the year that saw both Siemens’s
dynamo and Perkins’s aniline dye. It ended with the development of the
modern electronic tube in 1911. In between came typewriter and
automobile, electric light bulb, man-made fibers, tractors, streetcars,
synthetic drugs, telephone, radio, and airplane—to mention only a few.
In between, in other words, came the modern world.</p>
<p>By contrast, no truly new major industry was started after 1914 until
the late 1950s, when computers first became operational.</p>
<p>Between 1870 and 1914 the industrial geography of the world was in
rapid change. A new major industrial area emerged on average every
decade or so: the U.S. and Germany between 1860 and 1870, western Russia
and Japan during the next twenty years, Central Europe (that is, the
western part of the old Austria-Hungary and northern Italy) by 1900.
Between World War I and World War II, however, no major new industrial
area joined the “industrial club.”</p>
<p>Now, however, there are signs of rapid change, with Brazil and China,
for instance, approaching “the takeoff point”—Brazil may well have
reached it. Now, in other words, there are signs that fundamental
economic relationships will be in rapid change and flux. And while
Bretton Woods in 1944 attempted to restore the monetary world as it had
ex- isted before 1914—and almost succeeded for twenty-five years—the
Eurodollar of the sixties, followed by the “paper gold” of the Special
Drawing Rights a few years later, and finally by the abandonment of the
dollar as the key currency, ended the period in which yesterday was the
norm and clearly ushered in a period of great and rapid change and of
major innovation in international economy, international currency, and
international credit.</p>
<p>But the need for innovation will be equally great in the social
field. And the public- service institutions too will have to learn how
to manage innovation.</p>
<p>Just as the late nineteenth century was a period of tremendous
innovative activity in technology, so also was it in social and economic
institutions. And just as the fifty years after World War I were years
of technological continuity rather than of rapid change and innovation,
so also were they years of continuity in social and economic
institutions. Government as we know it today had largely been created by
the time of World War I. The Local Government reform in Great Britain
which began in the middle of the nine- teenth century created new
institutions, new relationships, and, above all, established new tasks
for government. Building the modern welfare state began shortly
thereafter in Bis- marck’s Germany. At about the same time—the 1880s—the
United States made a major contribution to the arts and practice of
government: the regulatory commission. Every one of the New Deal reforms
of the 1930s had been discussed, worked out, and in many cases put in
practice on the local or state level twenty years earlier, that is, in
the Progressive Era just before World War I.</p>
<p>The great American university was the innovative creation of half a
dozen brilliant university presidents between 1860 and 1900 (on this,
see Chapter 13). The modern hos- pital was essentially designed between
1900 and 1920. Armed services took their present shape in the two major
conflicts of the mid-nineteenth century, the American Civil War and the
Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Since then, the development has been
linear— larger armies, more firepower, more armor, but fundamentally the
same strategies and tactics and indeed even the same stress on “hardware
technology.” Even such radical technical innovations as the tank and the
airplane were largely integrated into traditional command structures and
traditional military doctrines.</p>
<p>Now the need for social and political innovation is becoming urgent
again. The mod- ern metropolis needs new governmental forms. The
relationship between man and his</p>
<p>environment has to be thought through and restructured. No modern
government governs effectively anymore. The crisis of the world is,
above all, an institutional crisis demanding institutional
innovation.</p>
<p>The business enterprise, its structure and organization, the way in
which it integrates knowledge into work and work into performance—and
the way in which it integrates en- terprise with society and
government—are also areas of major innovative need and inno- vative
opportunity. Surely there is need in the social and economic sphere for
another period of innovative activity such as we last lived through in
the second half of the nine- teenth century.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to the nineteenth century, however, innovation from
now on will have to be built into existing organizations. Large
businesses—and equally large public- service institutions—will have to
become increasingly capable of organizing themselves for innovation as
well as for administration.</p>
<p>In the first place, they command access to manpower and capital to a
degree un- dreamed of a hundred years ago. But also the ratio between
invention or research and the efforts needed to convert the results of
research or invention into new businesses, new products, or new
institutions had changed significantly. It is by now accepted, if only
as a rule of thumb, that for every dollar spent on generating an idea,
ten dollars have to be spent on “research” to convert it into a new
discovery or a new invention. For every ten dollars spent on “research,”
at least a hundred dollars need to be spent on development, and for
every hundred dollars spent on development, something between a thousand
and ten thousand dollars are needed to introduce and establish a new
product or a new busi- ness on the market. And only after a new product
or a new business has been established in the market is there an
“innovation.”</p>
<p>This may be particularly true with respect to the public-service
institution. A hundred years ago there were few of them and they were
small. The task then was largely to create new institutions where none
existed. Today these institutions are massive and dominate the social,
political, and economic landscape. They represent existing
bureaucracies, ex- isting concentrations of expertise, existing
assignments, and ongoing programs. If they cannot become innovative, the
new we need has little chance of becoming effective inno- vation. It is
likely to be smothered by muscle-bound giants of big government and big
armed service, big university and big hospital, and many others.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the small business, or even the lone
entrepreneur, will not continue to play an important role. Nothing is
further from the truth than the hoary myth of the Populists that the
small man is being squeezed out of the marketplace by the giants. The
innovative growth companies of the last twenty-five years all started as
small busi- nesses. And by and large the small businesses have done far
better than the giants.</p>
<p>In every single industry, except those where monopoly is protected by
government (e.g., in railroading), small upstarts which a few short
years ago were unknown have ac- quired major market positions and have
proven themselves more than capable of competi- tion with the giants.
This is particularly true, as has been said before, where the giants,
through natural growth or deliberate policy, grew into conglomerates. In
the chemical industry, in the electrical apparatus industry, and in many
others, the traditional giant, a GE or an Imperial Chemical, has lost
market position and market share in many mar- kets—and largely to small
or medium-sized newcomers with an innovative bent.</p>
<p>An established company which in an age demanding innovation is not
capable of in- novation is doomed to decline and extinction. And a
management which in such a period</p>
<p>does not know how to manage innovation is incompetent and unequal to
its task. Manag- ing innovation will increasingly become a challenge to
management, and especially to top management, and a touchstone of its
competence.</p>
<p>Innovative Examples</p>
<p>While in a minority, especially among big businesses, innovative
companies do exist. One might mention Renault in France and Fiat in
Italy, Marks andandandand Spencer in England, ASEA in Sweden, Sony in
Japan—or between the two World Wars, the publishing house of Ull- stein
in Germany. In the United States 3M (Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing,
St. Paul, Minnesota), the Bell Laboratories of the Telephone Company, or
the Bank of Amer- ica come to mind. These firms—apparently have no
difficulty innovating and no difficulty getting change accepted in their
organizations. Their managements, one would expect, rarely have occasion
to ask, “How can we keep our organization flexible and willing to accept
the new?” These managements are much too busy finding the manpower and
the money to run with the innovations their own organizations force on
them.</p>
<p>Innovative organizations are not confined to business. Both the
Manhattan Project in the United States, which developed the atomic bomb
during World War II, and CBRN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche
Nucleaire) in Geneva under its first Director- General, Victor
Weisskopf, furnish examples of innovative organizations. This is all the
more remarkable, as these two institutions were heavily staffed with
university professors who, in their natural habitat, are remarkably
resistant to change and notoriously slow to innovate.</p>
<p>These examples indicate that an organization’s ability to innovate is
a function of management rather than of industry, size, or age of the
organization, let alone to be ex- plained with that common excuse of
poor managers, a country’s “culture and traditions.”</p>
<p>Nor can the explanation be found in research. Bell
Laboratories—perhaps the most productive industrial research
laboratory—has indeed been stressing for many years fun- damental
inquiries into the laws of nature. But Renault and Fiat are not
particularly dis- tinguished for their research; what makes them
innovative organizations is ability to get new designs and new models
rapidly into production and on the market. The Bank of America, finally,
innovates mainly in its customers’ businesses, and in terms of financial
structure and credit, inventory and marketing policies.</p>
<p>These examples imply that the innovative organization
institutionalizes the innovative spirit and creates a habit of
innovation. At the beginning of these organizations there might well
have been an individual, a great innovator. He might have succeeded in
build- ing around him an organization to convert into successful
business reality his new ideas and inventions—as did Werner von Siemens
in Germany a hundred years ago, A. P. Giannini in building the Bank of
America seventy years ago, and as Edwin H. Land of Polaroid has been
doing since World War II. But no such founding genius presided over Bell
Laboratories, over 3M, or over Renault. The innovative organization
manages to innovate as an organization, that is, as a human group
organized for continual and produc- tive innovation. It is organized to
make change into norm.</p>
<p>These various innovative organizations are very different indeed in
their structures, their businesses, their characteristics, and even
their organization and management phi- losophies. But they do have
certain characteristics in common.</p>
<p>1 Innovating organizations know what “innovation” means.</p>
<p>2 Innovative organizations understand the dynamics of innovation.</p>
<p>3 They have an innovative strategy.</p>
<p>4 They know that innovation requires objectives, goals, and
measurements that</p>
<p>are different from the objectives, goals, and measurements of a
managerial organization, and appropriate to the dynamics of
innovation.</p>
<p>5 Management, especially top management, plays a different role and
has a dif- ferent attitude in an innovative organization.</p>
<p>6 The innovative organization is structured differently and set up
differently from the managerial organization.</p>
<p>The Meaning of Innovation</p>
<p>Innovation organizations first know what “innovation” means. They
know that innovation is not science nor technology, but value. They know
that it is not something that takes place within an organization but a
change outside. The measure of innovation is the im- pact on the
environment. Innovation in a business enterprise must therefore always
be: market-focused. Innovation that is product-focused is likely to
produce “miracles of tech- nology” but disappointing rewards.</p>
<p>The outstanding innovators among the world’s pharmaceutical companies
define their goal as new drugs that will make a significant difference
to medical practice and to patient health. They do not define innovation
in terms of research, but in terms of the practice of medicine.
Similarly, Bell Laboratories always starts out with the question “What
will make a difference to telephone service?”</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, however, it is precisely the most market-focused
innovator who has come up with some of the most important technical or
scientific advances. Bell Labs, for instance, created the transistor,
produced the basic mathematics of information theory, and is responsible
for some of the fundamental discoveries underlying the computer.</p>
<p>To start out with the consumer’s or client’s need for a significant
change is often the most direct way to define new science, new
knowledge, and new technology, and to or- ganize purposeful and
systematical work on fundamental discovery.</p>
<p>The Dynamics of Innovation</p>
<p>Innovating businesses are aware of the dynamics of innovation. They
do not believe that innovation is determined—or at least they know that
there are so many factors in what- ever causal patterns may exist that
no one can possibly unravel them. Neither, however, do they share the
common belief that innovation is haphazard and incapable of being pre-
dicted or foreseen.</p>
<p>They know that innovation follows a probability distribution. They
know that it is possible to say what kind of innovation, if successfully
brought about, is likely to become a major product or process, a major
new business, a major market. They know how to look systematically for
the areas where innovative activity, if it produces results, is likely
to enjoy success and to be rewarding.</p>
<p>One such heuristic guide to what one could call “the
innovation-prone” is basic eco- nomic vulnerability of a process, a
technology, or an industry. Wherever an industry en- joys growing market
demand without being able to turn the demand into profitability, one can
say, with high probability, that a major innovation which changes
process, product, distributive channel, or customer expectations will
produce high rewards.</p>
<p>Examples abound. One is the paper industry, which, all the world
over, has enjoyed rapidly expanding consumer demands—on the order of 5
to 10 percent a year, year in and year out—without being able apparently
to earn a decent return on its capital. There is the steel industry,
which is in a very similar position. But there is also life insurance,
which is one of the few “products” a customer is ready to buy—one of the
few products, by the way, in which the interests of producer and
consumer are completely identical—and which yet has to be sold through
“hard-sell” methods and against apparently very high buyer
resistance.</p>
<p>Similarly, innovative opportunity exists where there is glaring
disparity between vari- ous levels of an economy or of a market.</p>
<p>The major growth industry in Latin America in the 1960s, for
instance, was not manu- facturing. It was retail distribution. Huge
masses of people flocked into the cities and from a subsistence economy
into a money economy. Individually they were, of course,</p>
<p>mostly very poor. But collectively they represented large new
purchasing power. Yet the distribution system in most Latin American
countries remained in the pre-urban mold— small shops, undercapitalized,
undermanaged, poorly stocked, and yet with very slow turnover. Wherever
an entrepreneur moved in to offer modern distribution—Sears, Roe- buck
was the first to recognize the opportunity—success was
instantaneous.</p>
<p>Another area of innovative opportunity is the exploitation of the
consequences of events that have already happened but have not yet had
their economic impacts. Demo- graphic developments, i.e., changes in
population, are among the most important. They are also the most nearly
certain. Changes in knowledge are less certain—the lead time is
difficult to predict. But they too offer opportunities. And then, most
important, but least certain, are changes in awareness, changes in
vision, changes in people’s expectations.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry, for instance, earned its success largely
because it antici- pated the impact of fundamental changes in awareness.
After World War II health care every place became a “good buy.” And
drugs are the only way to health care easily acces- sible to poor and
poorly educated rural countries. Where physicians and hospitals are
scarce, drugs can still be dispensed and will be effective for a great
many health prob- lems. The pharmaceutical company which understood this
and went into the developing countries found that, with respect to drug
purchases, they are “fully developed.”</p>
<p>Finally, of course, there are the innovations which are not part of
the pattern, the inno- vations that are unexpected and that change the
world rather than exploit it. They are the innovations in which an
entrepreneur sets out to make something happen. They are the truly
important innovations. They are the innovations of a Henry Ford, who
envisioned something that did not exist at the time, namely a mass
market, and then set about to make it happen.</p>
<p>These innovations lie outside of the probability distribution—or, at
least, they place so far toward the extreme as to be grossly improbable.
They are also clearly the most risky ones. For every one such innovation
that succeeds, there must be ninety-nine that fail, ninety-nine of which
nothing is ever heard.</p>
<p>It is important for the innovating business to realize that these
atypical innovations ex- ist and that they are of supreme importance. It
is important to keep watching for them. But, by their very nature, they
cannot be the object of systematic, purposeful organized activity within
the business enterprise. They cannot be managed.</p>
<p>And they are sufficiently rare to be treated as exceptions, despite
their overreaching importance. The business that focuses on the
probability pattern and organizes its innova- tion strategy to take
advantage of it will innovate. And it will in the process become sensi-
tive to the exceptional, the great, the truly historic innovation, and
equipped to recognize it early and to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>To manage innovation, a manager need not be a technologist. Indeed,
the first-rate technologist is rarely good at managing innovation. He is
so deeply engrossed in his spe- cialty that he rarely sees development
outside of it. It is not a metallurgist who is likely to recognize the
importance of basic new knowledge in plastics even though it may, within
a reasonably short time, obsolete a good many of his proudest products.
Similarly, the in- novative manager need not be an economist. The
economist, by definition, can concern himself with the impact of
innovations only after they have become massive. The innovat- ing
manager needs to anticipate vulnerabilities and opportunities—and this
is not the economist’s bent. The innovative manager needs to study
innovation as such and to learn its dynamics, its pattern, its
predictability. To manage innovation, a manager has to be at least
literate with respect to the dynamics of innovation.*</p>
<p>Innovative Strategy</p>
<p>Like all business strategies, an innovative strategy starts out with
the question “What is our business and what should it be?” But its
assumptions regarding the future are different</p>
<p>*For a more extended discussion of this topic, see my book, Managing
for Results, especially Part II.</p>
<p>from the assumptions made with respect to the ongoing business. There
the assumption is that present product lines and services, present
markets and present distribution channels, present technologies and
processes will continue. The first objective of a strategy for the
ongoing business is to optimize what already exists or is being
established.</p>
<p>The ruling assumption of an innovative strategy is that whatever
exists is aging. The assumption must be that existing product lines and
services, existing markets and distribu- tion channels, existing
technologies and processes will sooner or later—and usually sooner—go
down rather than up.</p>
<p>The governing device of a strategy for the ongoing business might
therefore be said to be: “Better and More.” For the innovative strategy
the device has to be: “New and Differ- ent.”*</p>
<p>The foundation of innovative strategy is planned and systematic
sloughing off of the old, the dying, the obsolete. Innovating
organizations spend neither time nor resources on defending yesterday.
Systematic abandonment of yesterday alone can free the resources, and
especially the scarcest resource of them all, capable people, for work
on the new.</p>
<p>Unwillingness to do this may be the greatest obstacle to innovation
in the existing large business. That the General Electric Company did
not succeed in establishing itself as a computer producer is, within the
company itself, explained in large part as the result of unwillingness
or inability to make available managers and professionals of the high
quality and proven performance capacity needed. To be sure, GE assigned
a great many good people to its computer group. But few of them were
allowed to stay there long. No sooner were they gone from their original
post in a research lab or a large division, than the cry went up “we
cannot do without them,” and back they went to their old assignments of
improving what was already known and what was already done.</p>
<p>The new and especially the as-yet unborn, that is, the future
innovation, always looks insignificant compared to the large volume, the
large revenue, and the manifold problems of the ongoing business. It is
all the more important, therefore, for an existing business to commit
itself to the systematic abandonment of yesterday if it wants to be able
to create tomorrow.</p>
<p>Second in a strategy of innovation is the clear recognition that
innovation efforts must aim high. It is just as difficult, as a rule, to
make a minor modification to an existing product as it is to innovate a
new one.</p>
<p>Michaei J. Kami, the author of the essay cited above, states as a
rule of thumb that the projected results of innovative efforts should be
at least three times as large as the results needed to attain company
objectives. This is probably an underestimate. In improvement
work—adding a new product, upgrading a product line, broadening the
market, and so on—one can assume a success rate of 50 percent. No more
than half the projects should be total failures.</p>
<p>This is not the way innovation works. Here the assumption must be
that the majority of innovative efforts will not succeed. Nine out of
every ten “brilliant ideas” turn out to be nonsense. And nine out of
every ten ideas which, after thorough analysis, seem to be worthwhile
and feasible turn out to be failures or, at best, puny weaklings. The
mortality rate of innovations is—and should be—high.</p>
<p>Innovative strategy therefore aims at creating a new business rather
than a new prod- uct within an already established line. It aims at
creating new performance capacity rather than improvement. It aims at
creating new concepts of what is value rather than satisfying existing
value expectations a little better. The aim of innovating efforts is to
make a sig- nificant difference. What is significantly different is not
a technical decision. It is not the quality of science that makes the
difference. It is not how expensive an undertaking it is or how hard it
is to bring it about. The significant difference lies in the impact on
the envi- ronment.</p>
<p>*This point has been made with great force by Michael J. Kami, who
served successively as head of long-range planning for IBM and Xerox.
See his essay, “Business Planning and Business Opportunity,” in Peter F.
Drucker, ed., Preparing Tomorrow’s Business Leaders Today.</p>
<p>“Success” in innovating efforts is a batting average of one out of
ten. This is, of course, the reason for aiming high in innovative
efforts. The one winner has to make up for the nine losers and has to
produce its own results.</p>
<p>Bernard Baruch is mostly remembered today as the head of the U.S. war
economy in World War I and the friend, confidant, and advisor of
presidents from Woodrow Wilson to Harry Truman. But before Baruch became
America’s elder statesman, he had amassed a very sizable fortune as a
venture capitalist. While other financiers of his era, the thirty years
before World War I, speculated in real estate and railroad bonds, Baruch
looked for new and innovative businesses. He knew apparently little
about technology—or at least affected ignorance. He invested in the man
rather than in the idea. And he invested at the very early stage at
which the budding business, as a rule, did not need much money be- yond
a few years’ support for a man with an idea. He invested on the
principle that eight out of every ten investments would turn out
failures and would have to be written off. But he maintained—and his own
record proved him right—that if only two out of ten turned out to be
successful, he would reap a far larger harvest than the shrewdest
investor in al- ready existing businesses could possibly attain.</p>
<p>An innovation does not proceed in a nice linear progression. For a
good long time, sometimes for years, there is only effort and no
results. The first results are then usually meager. Indeed, the first
products are rarely what the customer will eventually buy. The first
markets are rarely the major markets. The first applications are rarely
the applica- tions that, in the end, will turn out to be the really
important ones.</p>
<p>The discussion of the social impacts of new technology (Chapter 25)
pointed out that the impacts of new technology are very difficult, and
sometimes impossible, to predict. But this difficulty extends to
everything connected with the truly new—as demonstrated by the example
(also given in Chapter 25) of the gross miscalculation of the size of
the computer market in the thorough market-research study conducted
around 1950. But even more difficult to predict than the eventual
success of the genuinely new is the speed with which it will establish
itself. “Timing is of the essence”—above all in innovation. Yet timing
is totally incapable of being predicted. There are the computer, the
antibiotics, the Xerox machine—all innovations that swept the market.
But for every successful innova- tion that has results faster than
anyone anticipates, there are five or six others—in the end perhaps,
equally successful ones—which for long years seem to make only
frustratingly slow headway. The outstanding example may be the
steam-driven ship. By 1835 its supe- riority was clearly established;
but it did not replace the sailing ship until fifty years later. Indeed,
the “golden age of sail” in which the great clippers reached perfection
began only after the steamship had been fully developed. For almost half
a century, in other words, the steamship continued to be “tomorrow” and
never seemed to become “today.”</p>
<p>But then, after a long, frustrating period of gestation, the
successful innovation rises meteorically. It becomes within a few short
years a new major industry or a new major product line and market. But
until it has reached that point it cannot be predicted when it will take
off, nor indeed whether it ever will.</p>
<p>Measurements and Budgets</p>
<p>Innovation strategy requires different measurements and a different
use of budgets and budgetary controls from those appropriate to an
ongoing business.</p>
<p>To impose on innovating efforts the measurements, and especially the
accounting conventions that fit ongoing businesses, is misdirection. It
cripples the innovative effort the way putting a one-hundred-pound pack
would cripple a six-year-old going on a hike. And it also fails to give
true control. Finally, it may become a threat when the innovation
becomes successful. For then it needs controls that are appropriate to
rapid growth, that is, controls which show what efforts and investments
are needed to exploit success and prevent overextension.</p>
<p>The successfully innovating businesses learned this long ago. The
oldest, best-known, and most successful managerial control system is
probably that of the Du Pont Company,</p>
<p>which, as early as the 1920s, developed a model for all its
businesses focused on return on investment. But innovations were not
included in that famous model. As long as a busi- ness, a product line,
or a process was in the innovating stage, its capital allocation was not
included in the capital base on which the individual Du Pont division in
charge of the project had to earn a return. Nor were the expenses
included in its expense budget. Both were kept separate. Only after the
new product line had been introduced in the market and had been sold in
commercial quantities for two years or more were its measurements and
controls merged into the budget of the division responsible for the
development.</p>
<p>This made sure that division general managers did not resist
innovation as a threat to their earnings record and performance. It also
made sure that expenditures on, and in- vestments in, innovative efforts
could be tightly controlled. It made it possible to ask at every step,
“What do we expert at the end, and what is the risk factor, that is, the
likeli- hood of nonsuccess?” “Can we justify continuing this particular
innovative effort or not?”</p>
<p>Budgets for ongoing businesses and budgets for innovative efforts
should not only be kept separate, they should be treated differently. In
the ongoing business, the question is always “Is this effort necessary?
Or can we do without it?” And if the answer is “We need it,” one asks,
“What is the minimum level of support that is needed?”</p>
<p>In the innovative effort the first and most serious question is “Is
it the right opportu- nity?” And if the answer is yes, one asks, “What
is the maximum of good people and key resources which can productively
be put to work at this stage?”</p>
<p>A separate measurement system for innovative effort makes it possible
to appraise the three factors that determine innovative strategy: the
ultimate opportunity, the risk of fail- ure, and the effort and
expenditure needed. Otherwise, efforts will be continued or will even be
stepped up where the opportunity is quite limited while the risk of
nonsuccess is great.</p>
<p>Examples are the many broad-spectrum antibiotics produced with great
scientific in- genuity by pharmaceutical companies in the late sixties.
By then the probability of synthe- sizing a new broad-spectrum
antibiotic with properties significantly better than those al- ready on
the market had become fairly small. The risk of nonsuccess was high, in
other words. At the same time the opportunity had become much more
limited than ten years earlier. Even an antibiotic with significantly
better performance than the existing ones would have to compete against
perfectly good products with which the physicians were familiar and
which they had learned to use. Even a scientific breakthrough would in
all likelihood have produced a “me-too” product. At the same time, the
expenditure and ef- fort needed to find anything really new in a field
that had been worked over so thoroughly were rising fast. Traditional
market thinking, that is, thinking that looks at the size of the market
and deduces therefrom great success for a new product that is “better,”
would have been totally misleading—as indeed it misled a substantial
number of companies.</p>
<p>Nothing is therefore as inimical to successful innovation as a goal
of “5 percent growth in profits” every year. Innovations for the first
three or five years—some for longer—show no growth in profits. They do
not show any profits at all. And then their growth rate for five to ten
years should be closer to 40 percent a year than to 5 percent a year. It
is only after they have reached relative maturity that they can be
expected to grow year by year by a small percentage. But then they are
no longer innovations.</p>
<p>Innovative strategy, therefore, requires a high degree of discipline
on the part of the innovator. He has to operate without the crutch of
the conventional budget and accounting measures which feed back fairly
fast and reasonably reliable information from current results to efforts
and investments. The temptation is to keep on pouring people and money
into innovative efforts without any results. It is therefore important
in managing innova- tion to think through what one expects, and when.
Inevitably, these expectations are changed by events. But unless there
are intermediate results, specific progress, “fallouts” to actual
operation along the way, the innovation is not being managed.</p>
<p>When Du Pont engaged, in the late twenties, in the polymer research
that eventually led to nylon more than ten years later, no one was
willing or able to predict whether mas- tery of polymer technology would
lead to synthetic rubber, to textile fibers, to synthetic</p>
<p>leathers, or to new lubricants. (In the end, of course, it 1ed to all
of them.) It was not until fairly close to the end of the work that it
became clear that synthetic fiber would be the first major commercial
product. But from the beginning Du Pont, together with Dr. Car- rothers,
the research scientist in charge, systematically laid out a road map of
what kind of findings and results could be expected and when. This map
was changed every two or three years as results came in. But it was
always redrawn again for the next stages along the road. And only when
he came up with polymer fibers, which then made large-scale development
work possible, did Du Pont commit itself to massive investment. Until
then, the total cost was essentially the cost of supporting Carrothers
and a few assistants.</p>
<p>The Risk of Failure</p>
<p>A strategy for innovation has to be based on clear acceptance of the
risk of failure—and of the perhaps more dangerous risk of
“near-success.”</p>
<p>It is as important to decide when to abandon an innovative effort as
it is to know which one to start. In fact, it may be more important.
Successful laboratory directors know when to abandon a line of research
which does not yield the expected results. The less successful ones keep
hoping against hope, are dazzled by the “scientific challenge” of a
project, or are fooled by the scientists’ repeated promise of a
“breakthrough next year.” And the unsuccessful ones cannot abandon a
project and cannot admit that what seemed like a good idea has turned
into a waste of men, time, and money.</p>
<p>But a fair number of innovative efforts end up in near-success rather
than in success or failure. And near-success can be more dangerous than
failure. There is, again and again, the product or the process that was
innovated with the expectation that it would “revolu- tionize” the
industry only to have it become a minor addition to the product line,
neither enough of a failure to be abandoned nor enough of a success to
make a difference. There is the innovation which looks so “exciting”
when work on it is begun, only to be over- taken, during its gestation
period, by a more innovative process, product, or service. There is the
innovation which was meant to become a “household word” that ends up as
another “specialty” which a few customers are willing to buy but not
willing to pay for.</p>
<p>It is therefore particularly important in managing innovation to
think through and to write out one’s expectations. And then, once the
innovation has become a product, a process, or a busincss, one compares
one’s expectations to reality. If reality is signifi- cantly below
expectations, one does not pour in more men or more money. One rather
asks, “Should we not go out of this, and how?”</p>
<p>Bernard Baruch knew this seventy years ago. When asked whether there
were not in- vestments in innovations that were neither great successes
nor great failures, he is re- ported to have answered, “Of course—but
those I sell as early as possible and for what- ever I can get.” He then
added, “In my early days those were the ventures on which I spent all my
time. I always thought I could turn them around and make them the
success we had originally expected. It never worked. But I found that I
missed the real opportuni- ties and that I misallocated my money by
putting it into ‘sound investments,’ rather than into the big
opportunities of the future.”</p>
<p>The Innovative Attitude</p>
<p>Resistance to change, by executives and workers alike, has for many
years been consid- ered a central problem of management. Countless books
and articles have been written on the subject. Countless seminars,
discussions, and courses have been devoted to it. Yet it is questionable
that much progress has been made in resolving the problem.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is incapable of being resolved as long as we talk of
“resistance to change.”</p>
<p>Not that there is no such resistance, or that it is not a major
obstacle. But to focus on re- sistance to change is to misdefine the
problem in a way that makes it less, rather than more, tractable. The
right way to define the problem so as to make it capable of resolution
is as a challenge to create, build, and maintain the innovative
organization, the organiza- tion for which change is norm rather than
exception, and opportunity rather than threat.</p>
<p>Innovation is, therefore, attitude and practices. It is, above all,
top-management attitude and practices. The innovative organization casts
top management into a different role and embodies a different concept of
top management’s relationship to the organization.</p>
<p>In the traditional managerial organization such as management texts
discuss, top man- agement is final judge. This means, in effect, that
management’s most important power is the veto power, and its most
important role is to say no to proposals and ideas that are not
completely thought through and worked out. This concept is caricatured
in that well- known jingle composed many years ago by a senior Unilever
executive.</p>
<p>Along this tree</p>
<p>From root to crown</p>
<p>Ideas flow up</p>
<p>And vetoes down.</p>
<p>In the innovative organization, the first and most important job of
management is the opposite: it is to convert impractical, half-baked,
and wild ideas into concrete innovative reality. In the innovative
organization, top management sees it as its job to listen to ideas</p>
<p>and to take them seriously. Top management, in the innovative
organization, knows that new ideas are always “impractical.” It also
knows that it takes a great many silly ideas to spawn one viable one,
and that in the early stages there is no way of telling the silly idea
from the stroke of genius. Both look equally impossible or equally
brilliant.</p>
<p>Top management in the innovative organization, therefore, not only
“encourages”</p>
<p>ideas, as all managements are told to do. It asks continuously, “What
would this idea have to be like to be practical, realistic, effective?”
It organizes itself to think through rapidly even the wildest and
apparently silliest idea for something new to the point where its fea-
sibility can be appraised.</p>
<p>Top management in the innovative organization is the major “drive”
for innovation. It uses the ideas of the organization as stimuli to its
own vision. And then it works to make ideas a concern of the entire
organization. Top management in the innovative organiza- tion fashions
thought and work on the new into both organizational energy and
entrepre- neurial discipline.</p>
<p>This, however, presupposes restructuring relations between top
management and the human group within the enterprise. The traditional
organization, of course, remains. In- deed, on the organization chart
there may be little to distinguish the innovative organiza- tion from
the most rigidly bureaucratic one. And an innovative organization need
not be “permissive” or “democratic” at all. But the innovative
organization builds, so to speak, a nervous system next to the bony
skeleton of the formal organization. Where traditional organization is
focused on the logic of the work, there is also an additional
relationship focused on the logic of ideas.</p>
<p>In innovative companies (as has been mentioned before) senior
executives typically make it their business to meet with the younger men
throughout the organization in scheduled (though not necessarily
regular) sessions in which there is no “agenda” for top management.
Rather, the seniors sit down with the younger men and ask, “What
opportu- nities do you see?”</p>
<p>In the period of its greatest growth and development, the 3M Company
was anything but a permissive company. It was tightly run by two or
three men at the top who made all the decisions. But even the most
junior engineer was encouraged, indeed practically commanded, to come to
the top-management people with any idea, no matter how wild. And again
and again he would be told, “The idea makes no sense to me; but are you
will- ing to work on it?” If the engineer said yes, he would then be
asked to write up his idea, together with a budget request—and more
often than not he would be freed from his other responsibilities, given
a modest sum of money for a year or two, and told to go ahead. As a
result, the company grew from a small and obscure producer of abrasives
into one of America’s largest businesses.</p>
<p>Yet the young engineers at 3M were held strictly accountable. Not all
of them suc- ceeded, of course. Indeed, only one or two out of every ten
did. And failure of an idea was not held against them—at least, not the
first time. But failure to take responsibility, to organize the task, to
work at it, and to appraise progress realistically—let alone to keep top
management fully informed of the progress of the project—was not
tolerated.</p>
<p>The innovative organization requires a learning atmosphere throughout
the entire business. It creates and maintains continuous learning. No
one is allowed to consider him- self “finished” at any time. Learning is
a continuing process for all members of the or- ganization.</p>
<p>Resistance to change is grounded in ignorance and in fear of the
unknown. Change has to be seen as opportunity by people—and then there
will be no fear. It is seen as opportu- nity by the Japanese because
they are guaranteed their jobs and are not afraid of putting themselves
or their colleagues out of work by proposing something new (see Chapter
20). But fear and ignorance are also overcome in Japan by making
continuing change the op- portunity for personal achievement, for
recognition, for satisfaction. The man who in a Japanese training
session comes up with a new idea receives no monetary reward, even if
his idea is a big and profitable one. But even if it is a very small
improvement he derives stature, recognition, intense pleasure.</p>
<p>We need not go to Japan to learn this. Every one of the “suggestion
systems” that are so widely used in American business teaches the same
lesson. The suggestion system in which the reward is recognition,
achievement, participation, is the successful system. And in those
departments in a plant where the suggestion system is being run this
way, there is very little resistance to change, despite fears for job
security and union restrictions. Where this does not prevail—as in the
great majority—the suggestion system is not a suc- cess, no matter how
well it pays for successful suggestions. It also has none of the effect
on worker behavior and attitude which the proponents of the suggestion
system promise.</p>
<p>Structure for Innovation</p>
<p>The search for innovation needs to be organized separately and
outside of the ongoing managerial business. Innovative organizations
realize that one cannot simultaneously cre- ate the new and take care of
what one already has. They realize that maintenance of the present
business is far too big a task for the people in it to have much time
for creating the new, the different business of tomorrow. They also
realize that taking care of tomorrow is far too big and difficult a task
to be diluted with concern for today. Both tasks have to be done. But
they are different.</p>
<p>Innovative organizations, therefore, put the new into separate
organizational compo- nents concerned with the creation of the new.</p>
<p>The oldest example is probably the development department at E. I. du
Pont de Ne- mours in Wilmington, founded in the early twenties. This
unit is concerned exclusively with the making of tomorrow. It is not a
research department—Du Pont has a separate, big research lab. The job of
the development department is to develop new businesses; production,
finance, and marketing are as much its concern as technology, products,
and processes. 3M, too, has set up a separate business development lab
in parallel with, but separate from, its research labs.</p>
<p>This was not understood in 1952 when the General Electric Company
embarked on its massive reorganization which then became the prototype
for major organization changes in large businesses around the world.
Under the GE plan the general manager of every “product business” was to
have responsibility for both the ongoing business in his charge and the
innovative efforts for tomorrow’s new and different business. This
seemed plausi- ble enough. Indeed it seemed an inescapable conclusion
from the idea that the general manager of a product business should, as
much as possible, behave like the chief execu- tive of an independent
business. But it did not work—the general managers did not inno-
vate.</p>
<p>One reason was the press of ongoing business. General managers had
neither the time nor the motivation to work on obsoleting what they were
managing. Another, equally im- portant reason was that true innovation
is rarely an extension of the already existing busi- ness. It rarely
fits into the scope, objectives, goals, technologies or processes of
today. But, of course, one can define only the scope, products,
technologies, processes—even the markets—of today. The most important
innovative opportunities always fall outside existing definitions—and
thereby outside the “assigned scope” of an existing decentral- ized
product business. After ten years or so GE began to draw the proper
conclusions from its frustrations and began to organize major innovation
separately and outside of existing product departments and product
divisions—and very similar to the way innova- tive efforts had been
organized at Du Pont for many years, that is, in a separate organiza-
tional “business development” unit.</p>
<p>Experience in public-service institutions also indicates that
innovative efforts best be organized separately and outside of existing
managerial organization.</p>
<p>The greater innovative capacity of the American university as
compared to the univer- sities of continental Europe has often been
remarked upon. The main reason is clearly not that American academicians
are less resistant to change. It is the ease with which the American
university can set up a new department, a new faculty, or even an
entirely new school to do new things. The European university, by
contrast, tends to be compelled by law and tradition to set up a new
activity within an already existing department or faculty. This not only
creates immediately a “war of the ancients against the moderns” in which
the new is fought as a threat by the established disciplines. It also
deprives the new, as a rule, of the resources needed to innovate
successfully. The ablest of the young scholars, for instance, will be
under great pressure to stick to the “safe” traditional fields which
still control the opportunities for promotion. For significant
innovation to move fast in the European academic setting usually
requires “break-away institutions.” The great age of English physics and
chemistry in the late seventeenth century was ushered in by setting up
the Royal Academy outside the established university system. More than
two hundred years later, a similar break-away institution, the London
School of Economics, created the opportunity for genuine innovation in
teaching—and learning—in the economic and so- cial fields. In France,
Napoleon systematically set up the grandes écoles such as the École
Polytechnique and the École Normale outside the university system as
vehicles for inno- vation in learning and research, e.g., to make
effective the then brand-new idea that teach- ers needed training and
could actually be trained. And one of the main reasons why the Germans,
in the decade before World War I, set up the separate scientific
research insti- tutes of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft (now Max-Planck
Gesellschaft) was to gain freedom to develop new disciplines and new
approaches in old disciplines, that is, to gain freedom for
innovation.</p>
<p>Similarly the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb, as
well as CERN, the European nuclear-research facility, were set up
outside the existing academic and governmental structures precisely
because their purpose was to be innovation.</p>
<p>Innovation as a “Business”</p>
<p>At the same time, the innovative organizations realize that
innovation needs from the be- ginning to be organized as a “business”
rather than as a “function.” In concrete terms, this means setting aside
the traditional time sequence in which “research” comes first, fol-
lowed by “development,” followed by “manufacturing,” with “marketing” at
the very end. The innovative organizations consider these functional
skills as part of one and the same process, the process of developing a
new business. When and how each of these tools is to be put into play is
decided by the logic of the situation rather than by any preconceived
time sequence.</p>
<p>A project manager or business manager is therefore put in charge of
anything new as soon as it is decided to pay attention to it. He may
come from any function—or from no function at all. And he can draw on
all the functions right from the beginning; use market-</p>
<p>ing, for instance, before there is any research; or work out the
financial requirements of a future business before he even knows whether
he will have products.</p>
<p>The traditional functions organize work from where we are today to
where we are go- ing. The innovative function organizes work from where
we want to be, back to what we now have to do in order to get there.</p>
<p>The design principle for innovation is the team, set up outside of
existing structures, that is, as an “autonomous unit.” It is not a
“decentralized business” in the traditional sense of the word, but it
has to be autonomous and separate from operating organizations.</p>
<p>One way to organize innovative units within a large business might
well be to group them together into an innovative group, which reports
to one member of top management who has no other function but to guide,
help, advise, review, and direct the innovating team at work. This is,
in effect, what the Du Pont development department is. Innovation has
its own logic, which is different from the logic of an ongoing business.
No matter how much the innovative units may themselves differ in their
technologies, their markets, their products, or their services, they all
have in common that they are innovative.</p>
<p>Even such autonomous team organization may be too restricted for the
kind of innova- tion that will increasingly be needed, innovation in
fields that are quite different from anything that business has done so
far. We may need to set up the innovating unit as a genuine
entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Several large companies in the United States, e.g., GE and
Westinghouse—and also several large companies in Europe—have set up
innovative efforts in the form of partner- ships with the
“entrepreneurs” in charge. The innovative effort is organized as a
separate company, in which the parent company has majority control and
usually a right to buy out the minority stockholders at some prearranged
price. But the entrepreneurs, that is, the people who are responsible
directly for developing the innovation, are substantial share- holders
in their own right.</p>
<p>One advantage of such a relationship is that it eases the
compensation problem. Inno- vative people can command substantial
salaries in the managerial organization, as senior research scientists
or as senior marketing people. Yet it is highly undesirable to saddle an
innovative venture with high salary costs—it cannot afford them. At the
same time, it is highly desirable to compensate the entrepreneurs for
results. But results in the innovative effort are unlikely to be known
for a good many years. A method of compensation which induces these
entrepreneurs to work for modest salaries until results are achieved,
while promising substantial rewards in case of success, is therefore
appropriate. A “partnership” makes this possible. It also—and this is no
small advantage—lessens (although it never completely eliminates) the
friction which setting up separate innovative organizations within the
company structure otherwise creates.</p>
<p>The same results, however, can also be achieved without a
partnership—provided the tax laws permit it (which, in many countries,
they no longer do). 3M, for instance, never organized a partnership with
its young engineers heading a project team. It never set up a separate
corporation in which the entrepreneurs became shareholders. Still, the
salaries of the entrepreneurs were kept low until the innovation had
proven itself and had become successful. And then the entrepreneurs not
only had the opportunity to stay on and man- age what they had created,
at salaries commensurate to the size and performance of the business
they had built, they also received handsome bonuses.</p>
<p>Whether these “confederations” in which the entrepreneurs become
partners and shareholders will become general will depend as much on tax
laws as on economics or organization structure. The principle, however,
is important: compensation of the innova- tors should be appropriate to
the economic reality of the innovating process. This is a process in
which the risks are high, the lead time long, and the rewards, in case
of success, very great.</p>
<p>Whether the innovating team is a separate company or simply a
separate unit, an inno- vating company is likely to apply some of the
design principles of systems management. There will be managerial units
engaged in managing what is already known and what is already being
done. And there will be innovative units, separate from them, working
with</p>
<p>them but also working on their own, and charged with their own
responsibility. Both will have to report independently of each other to
the top-management group and work with top-management people. To
innovate within existing organizations will require accep- tance of a
hybrid and rather complex organization design. It is neither centralized
nor decentralized. Within such a company, functional organization,
federal decentralization, simulated decentralization, and teams may all
be found next to each other and working together.</p>
<p>The innovative organization, the organization that resists stagnation
rather than change, is a major challenge to management, private and
public. That such organizations are possi- ble, we can assert with
confidence; there are enough of them around. But how to make such
organizations general, how to make them productive for society, economy,
and indi- vidual alike, is still largely an unsolved task. There is
every indication that the period ahead will be an innovative one; one of
rapid change in technology, society, economy, and institutions. There is
every indication, therefore, that the innovative organization will have
to be developed into a central institution for the last quarter of the
twentieth century.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h4>
<p>The Legitimacy of Management</p>
<p>In this century, society has become a society of organizations. Every
major social task in this society is being performed in and through
large, managed institutions. As a result the great majority of people in
developed countries work as employees. They work as mem- bers of managed
institutions and within a managerial structure and organization.</p>
<p>In this century, society has become a knowledge society. More and
more of the mem- bers of developed society make their living by putting
knowledge to work. More and more acquire their qualifications through
long years of formal education. More and more of them are managers
themselves or work as knowledge professionals with direct respon-
sibility for performance and results.</p>
<p>The two developments are interrelated. Because of the emergence of
the society of or- ganizations, one can now make a living through
knowledge work. And because of the availability of large numbers of
people with substantial formal education, large institu- tions are
possible and can be managed.</p>
<p>Management is both the carrier and the result of these two
developments. It is the or- gan through which the institutions of the
society of organizations can be made to function and to perform their
mission. And management itself is such a “knowledge.” It is a disci-
pline with its own subject matters, its own skills, its own expertise.
Above all, the manag- ers of these institutions in a society of
organizations form the leadership groups of the society.</p>
<p>Unless this society of organizations destroys itself, managers as a
leadership group and management as a discipline and challenge will
remain with us. To repeat the leitmotiv of this book, we are moving from
management boom to management performance. It is the task of this
management generation to make the institutions of the society of
organiza- tions, beginning with the business enterprise, perform for
society and economy; for the community; and for the individual
alike.</p>
<p>This requires, first, that managers know their discipline. It
requires that they know management.</p>
<p>We hear a great deal today about the manager of the future. But the
important man is the manager of today. And the first requirement is that
the manager know his craft, his tools, his task and responsibility. The
first requirement is that he be able to function.</p>
<p>The Limits of Technocracy</p>
<p>The management boom focused on management skills and management
competence. But it largely defined the management job as internal. It
was concerned with organization and motivation, with financial and other
controls, with the management sciences, and with manager development. It
was, to use a fashionable term, technocratic in its orientation. This
was understandable. It was also right. One has to know one’s own craft.
There are few things as useless as the man who wants to set right the
world because he does not know his own job.</p>
<p>But if the years of the management boom have taught us anything, it
is that the tech- nocrat as manager is not enough. It is precisely
because in the society of organizations</p>
<p>there is no leadership group other than the managers that more is
required than technoc- racy.</p>
<p>The first task of the manager is indeed to manage the institution for
the mission for which it has been designed. The first task of the
business manager is, therefore, economic performance. But at the same
time he faces the tasks of making the work productive and the worker
achieving, and of providing for the quality of life for society and
individual. And this goes well beyond technocracy.</p>
<p>President Kennedy’s administration was the peak of a great wave of
technocracy. It was also its tragedy. And Robert McNamara, President
Kennedy’s Secretary of Defense, personified both the strength and the
limitations of the technocrat. In the final analysis McNamara was a
failure—not because of Vietnam but because “managing” to him was focus
on the internal and excluded the external, the value, the people, the
social dimen- sions.</p>
<p>But General Motors also can be seen as the triumph and the failure of
the technocrat manager. Indeed the book which the builder of General
Motors, Alfred P. Sloan, wrote* shows both the strength of the truly
accomplished technocratic manager and his limita- tions. General Motors
has stayed with Sloan’s legacy. And in Sloan’s terms i.e., in terms of
sales and profits, it has succeeded admirably, at least in the North
American market. But it has also failed abysmally—in terms of public
reputation, of public esteem, of ac- ceptance by the public.†</p>
<p>There is great temptation here—the temptation for the manager to
become a philoso- pher, the temptation to become “cosmic.” Hence it
cannot be said too often that the foun- dation for “doing good” is
“doing well.” Good intentions are no excuse for incompetence. And the
manager who believes that social consciousness is a substitute for
managing his business—or his hospital or his university—so that it
produces the results for the sake of which it exists, is either a fool
or a knave or both.</p>
<p>The Need for Legitimacy</p>
<p>But a leadership group needs not only to function. It needs not only
to perform. It also has to have legitimacy. It has to be accepted by the
community as “right.”</p>
<p>“Legitimacy” is an elusive concept. It has, in effect, no real
definition. Yet it is cru- cial. Authority without legitimacy is
usurpation. And the leadership groups of a society— and this means the
managers today—have to have authority to perform their functions.</p>
<p>At the same time, none of the traditional grounds of legitimacy will
do for the manag- ers. Birth or magic are just as unsuitable for them as
popular election or the rights of pri- vate property. They hold office
because they perform. And yet performance by itself has never been
sufficient grounds for legitimacy.</p>
<p>What managers need to be accepted as legitimate authority is a
principle of morality.</p>
<p>They need to ground their authority in a moral commitment which, at
the same time, ex- presses the purpose and character of
organizations.</p>
<p>Almost three centuries ago the English pamphleteer Mandeville in a
didactic poem “The Fable of the Bees” laid down what became, a century
later, the principle of capital- ism. “Private vices make public
benefit.” Blind and greedy profit-seeking, Mandeville laid down,
advances the public good through the “invisible hand.” In terms of
perform- ance, history has proven Mandeville remarkably right. But
morally his principle was never acceptable. And the fact that capitalism
has become the less acceptable the more it succeeded—as the great
Austro-American economist Joseph Schumpeter pointed out re- peatedly—has
been the basic weakness of modern society and modern economy.</p>
<p>This by the way, is why the rhetoric of “profit maximization” and
“profit motive” are not only antisocial. They are immoral.</p>
<p>*My Years with General Motors (Doubleday, 1964).</p>
<p>†On General Motors’s triumph and failure, see also the Epilogue to
the new (1972) edition of my book Concept of the Corporation.</p>
<p>Although we still talk in De Mandeville’s terms, we have long ago
shifted to a very different base. We long ago learned that it is the job
of the business manager to convert public needs into business
opportunities. It is his task to anticipate, identify, and satisfy the
needs of market and individual, the needs of consumer and employee.</p>
<p>But these are still inadequate grounds of legitimacy. They explain
business activity ra- tionally, but they do not supply it with the
justification for authority. To maintain an autonomous management, a
management that in serving its institution serves society and community,
a principle of morality has to be grounded in the purposes and the
character- istics of organization and in the nature of the institution
itself.</p>
<p>There is only one such principle. It is the purpose of organization
and, therefore, the grounds of management authority: to make human
strength productive. Organization is the means through which man, as an
individual and as a member of the community, finds</p>
<p>both contribution and achievement.</p>
<p>The invention of organization as society’s tool for accomplishing
social purposes may well be as important to the history of man as was
the invention of the specialization of labor for individuals ten
thousand years ago. And the principle underlying it is not “per- sonal
vices make public benefits.” It is “personal strengths make social
benefits.” This can serve as grounds for legitimacy. This is a moral
principle on which authority can be based.</p>
<p>To maintain management as autonomous, and indeed as “private,” is an
essential need of society. It is essential for keeping society free. It
is essential for keeping society per- forming. The alternative, the
“totalitarian” structure in which all activities, all individuals, and
all organizations monolithically repeat the same pattern, are managed by
one and the same governing group, and express the same values, the same
doctrine, and the same or- thodoxy, is not only death to the human
spirit, it is grotesque. It is also wasteful, rigid, stifting. It is
not, above all, business that needs the autonomy of the markets for
goods and services, for capital, and for jobs and careers, that is,
autonomous and accountable man- agement of autonomous institutions. It
is (as Chapter 27 pointed out earlier), the econ- omy, the society, and
government itself which require managerial autonomy and “free
enterprise.”</p>
<p>Yet to have a society of organizations with autonomous managements,
each a deci- sion-maker in its own sphere, requires that managers, while
private, also know themselves to be public. They are private in that
they are not subservient to a central political author- ity which, in
turn, is uncontrolled, uncontrollable, and despotic as inevitable
result. But they are public in that they consciously, knowingly, openly,
strive to make a public need into a private opportunity of their
autonomous self-governing institution.</p>
<p>The old fights are still being fought and the old slogans still
reverberate. Yet even the Soviet Union has had to accept “profit” as a
necessary condition of economic activity and as a means to build the
“capital fund” without which no economy can survive, let alone advance.
Indeed, the profit requirement of a totally planned and therefore rigid
economy is, of necessity, many times greater than that of a “market
economy.” “Ownership” is be- coming a secondary issue, especially as the
“workers” increasingly are also becoming the “owners” in the most highly
developed countries. This does not mean that we cannot be killed by
these old fights and issues. The scars fester and are toxic. But nothing
can be “solved” by the remedies of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>What is needed to break out of the straitjacket of old slogans and
old issues is man- agement performance. This first requires performance
as a technocrat. It requires per- formance that makes the manager’s
organization capable of supplying to society and economy the
contribution for the sake of which it exists, such as economic goods and
services and the capital fund for tomorrow. But it also requires
performance beyond the immediate mission, beyond technocracy:
performance in making work productive and the worker achieving and
performance with respect to the quality of life. But above all, it has
to be performance with respect to the role and function of the manager.
If he is to remain- as he should—the manager of an autonomous
institution, he must accept that he is a pub-</p>
<p>lic man. He must accept the moral responsibility of organization, the
responsibility of making individual strengths productive and
achieving.</p>
<h4 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h4>
<p>Management literature has become so vo1uminous that no one can hope
to keep up with it. Even to pick out the “best” books is a fruitless
attempt. What I have tried to do is to prepare a list—admittedly
overlong—of the books which a fairly large number of friends,
experienced managers in a number of countries around the world, have
found to be stimu- lating, readable, and worthwhile. Even so, the list
suffers from being heavily biased to- ward American authors.</p>
<p>To make the list more useful, I have divided the books into major
categories and have not hesitated to list a title more than once if it
seemed to me to deserve mention in several categories.</p>
<p>Most management books take Western, and especially American,
management for granted. For this reason, I have included a small list of
six titles on Japanese management. They wil1 not only help the Western
reader to understand the one non-Western manage- rial system in a highly
developed country, but will also give him a better insight into the
cultural and historical roots of his own system.</p>
