<h4 id="management-by-objectives-and-self-control">34 Management by
Objectives and Self-Control</h4>
<p>The Forces of Misdirection—Workmanship: A Necessity and a
Danger—Misdirection by the Boss—Misdirection by Compensation—What Should
the Objectives Be?— Management by Drives—How Should Managers’ Objectives
Be Set and By Whom?— Self-Control Through Measurements—Does It Demand
Too Much of the Individ- ual?—A Philosophy of Management</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>ACH MEMBER OF THE ENTERPRISE contributes something different, but all
must contribute toward a common goal. Their efforts must all pull in the
same direc- tion, and their contributions must fit together to produce a
whole—without gaps, without friction, without unnecessary duplication of
effort.</p>
<p>Performance requires that each job be directed toward the objectives
of the whole or- ganization. In particular, each manager’s job must be
focused on the success of the whole. The performance that is expected of
the manager must be directed toward the perform- ance goals of the
business. His results are measured by the contribution they make to the
success of the enterprise. The manager must know and understand what the
business goals demand of him in terms of performance, and his superior
must know what contribution to demand and expect. If these requirements
are not met managers are misdirected and their efforts are wasted.</p>
<p>Management by objectives requires major effort and special
instruments. For in a business enterprise managers are not automatically
directed toward a common goal. On the contrary, organization, by its
very nature, contains four powerful factors of misdirec- tion: the
specialized work of most managers; the hierarchical structure of
management; the differences in vision and work and the resultant
insulation of various levels of man- agement; and finally, the
compensation structure of the management group. To overcome these
obstacles requires more than good intentions, sermons, and exhortations.
It requires policy and structure. It requires that management by
objectives be purposefully organized and be made the living law of the
entire management group.</p>
<p>An old story tells of three stonecutters who were asked what they
were doing. The first replied, “I am making a living.” The second kept
on hammering while he said, “I am do- ing the best job of stonecutting
in the entire country.” The third one looked up with a vi- sionary gleam
in his eyes and said, “I am building a cathedral.”</p>
<p>The third man is, of course, the true manager. The first man knows
what he wants to get out of the work and manages to do so. He is likely
to give a “fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay.” But he is not a
manager and will never be one. It is the second man who is a problem.
Workmanship is essential: in fact, an organization demoralizes if it
does not demand of its members the highest workmanship they are capable
of. But there is always a danger that the true workman, the true
professional, will believe that he is accomplish- ing something when in
effect he is just polishing stones or collecting footnotes. Work-
manship must be encouraged in the business enterprise. But it must
always be related to the needs of the whole.</p>
<p>The majority of managers and of career professionals in any business
enterprise are, like the second man, concerned with specialized work.
True, the number of functional managers should always be kept at a
minimum, and there should be the largest possible number of “general”
managers who manage an integrated business and are directly re-
sponsible for its performance and results. Even with the utmost
application of this princi- ple the great bulk of managers will work in
functional jobs, however.</p>
<p>A man’s habits as a manager, his vision and his values, are usually
formed while he does functional and specialized work. It is essential
that the functional specialist develop high standards of workmanship,
that he strive to be “the best stonecutter in the country.” For work
without high standards is dishonest; it corrupts the man himself and
those around him. Emphasis on, and drive for, workmanship produces
innovations and ad- vances in every area of management. That managers
strive to do “professional personnel management,” to run “the most
up-to-date plant,” to do “truly scientific market research,” to “put in
the most modern accounting system,” or to do “perfect engineering” must
be encouraged.</p>
<p>But this striving for professional workmanship in functional and
specialized work is also a danger. It tends to divert a man’s vision and
efforts from the goals of the business. The functional work becomes an
end in itself. In far too many instances the functional manager no
longer measures his performance by its contribution to the enterprise
but only by his own professional criteria of workmanship. He tends to
appraise his subordinates by their craftsmanship and to reward and to
promote them accordingly. He resents demands made on him for the sake of
business performance as interference with “good engineer- ing,” “smooth
production,” or “hard-hitting selling.” The functional manager’s
legitimate desire for workmanship becomes, unless counterbalanced, a
centrifugal force which tears the enterprise apart and converts it into
a loose confederation of functional empires, each concerned only with
its own craft, each jealously guarding its own “secrets,” each bent on
enlarging its own domain rather than on building the business.</p>
<p>This danger is being greatly intensified by the technological and
social changes now under way. The number of highly educated specialists
working in the business enterprise is increasing tremendously. And so
will the level of workmanship demanded of these spe- cialists. Our work
force is increasingly becoming an “educated” work force in which the
majority make their contribution in the form of specialized knowledge.
The tendency to make the craft or function an end in itself will
therefore become even more marked than it is today. But at the same time
the new technology will demand much closer coordination between
specialists. It will demand that functional men, even at the lowest
management level, see the business as a whole and understand what it
requires of them. The new tech- nology will need both the drive for
excellence in workmanship and the consistent direc- tion of managers at
all levels toward the common goal.</p>
<p>That university teachers no longer see the university as their “home”
but rather give allegiance to their specialization is considered an
important reason for the crisis of the university. But exactly the same
tendency exists in all other institutions, business enter- prise
included.</p>
<p>Misdirection by the Boss</p>
<p>The hierarchical structure of management aggravates the danger. What
the boss does and says, his most casual remarks, his habits, even his
mannerisms, tend to appear to his sub- ordinates as calculated, planned,
and meaningful. “All you ever hear around the place is human-relations
talk; but when the boss calls you on the carpet it is always because
over- time is too high; and when it comes to promoting a guy, the plums
always go to those who do the best job filling out accounting-department
forms.” This is one of the most common tunes, sung with infinite
variations on every level of management. It leads to poor per-
formance—even in cutting overtime. It also expresses loss of confidence
in, and absence of respect for, the company and its management.</p>
<p>Yet the manager who so misdirects his subordinates does not intend to
do so. He genuinely considers human relations to be the most important
task of his plant managers. But he talks about overtime because he feels
that he has to establish himself with his men as a “practical man,” or
because he thinks that he shows familiarity with their problems by
talking “shop” with them. He stresses the accounting-department forms
only because they annoy him as much as they do his men—or he may just
not want to have any more trouble with the comptroller than he can help.
But to his subordinates these reasons are hidden; all they see and hear
is the question about overtime, the emphasis on forms.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem requires a structure of management which
focuses both the manager’s and his boss’s eyes on what the job—rather
than the boss—demands. To stress styles and manners—as does a good deal
of current management literature—is likely instead to aggravate the
problem. Indeed, everyone familiar with business today has seen
situations in which a manager’s attempt to avoid misdirection through
changing his manners has converted a fairly satisfactory relationship
into a nightmare of embarrass- ment and misunderstanding. The manager
himself becomes so self-conscious as to lose all easy relationship with
his men. And the men in turn react with: “So help us, the old man has
read a book; we used to know what he wanted of us, now we have to
guess.”</p>
<p>Differences in Levels of Management</p>
<p>Misdirection can result from difference in concern and function
between various levels of management. This problem, too, cannot be
solved by attitudes and good intentions; for it is rooted in the
structure of any enterprise. Nor can it be solved by “better communica-
tions,” for communications presuppose common understanding and a common
language, and it is precisely that which is usually lacking.</p>
<p>It is no accident that the old story of the blind men meeting up with
an elephant on the road is so popular among management people. Each
level of management sees the same “elephant”—the business—from a
different angle of vision. The production foreman, like the blind man
who felt the elephant’s leg and decided that a tree was in his way,
tends to see only the immediate production problems. Top management—the
blind man touching the trunk and deciding a snake bars his way—tends to
see only the enterprise as a whole; it sees stockholders, financial
problems, altogether a host of highly abstract relations and figures.
Operating management—the blind man feeling the elephant’s belly and
thinking himself up against a landslide—tends to see things
functionally. Each level needs its par- ticular vision; it could not do
its job without it. Yet, these visions are so different that people on
different levels talking about the same thing often do not realize
it—or, as fre- quently happens, believe that they are talking about the
same thing when in reality they are poles apart.</p>
<p>Misdirection by Compensation</p>
<p>The most serious force for misdirection within the management group
may be the com- pensation structure. At the same time, it is the most
refractory one. Somehow management people have to be paid, but every
compensation system is liable to misdirect.</p>
<p>Compensation is cost to the enterprise, and income to the recipient.
But it also always expresses status, both within the enterprise and in
society. It entails judgments on a man’s worth as much as on his
performances. It is emotionally tied to all our ideas of fairness,
justice, and equity. Money is, of course, quantitative. But the money in
any compensation system expresses the most intangible, but also the most
sensitive, values and qualities. For this reason, there can be no truly
simple or truly rational compensation system.</p>
<p>In Japan compensation, at least up to the time a manager reaches age
forty-five, is based on one factor alone: seniority. But this too tends
to misdirect, especially the younger men, into pleasing their superiors
rather than toward achieving results. The fact that immediate
compensation is not affected by performance only makes more important
the deferred judgment, that is, the decision whether a given executive,
at age forty-five, should be promoted into top management or should be
kept a middle manager and retired</p>
<p>ten years later. This, of course, does not affect the man who, early
in his career, decides that he is not going to make it anyhow or that it
is not worth the effort. But the ambitious, high performer—the very man
who should be motivated properly—is bound to be seri- ously misdirected
by the Japanese system. Acceptance by a clique rather than perform- ance
is likely to be his objective.</p>
<p>Any compensation system determines a man’s place within the group.
How his pay re- lates to the pay of others, and especially to the pay of
the men he considers his peers, is always more important than the
absolute amount of his salary. (On this see Chapters 15 and 18.)
Compensation must always try to balance recognition of the individual
with sta- bility and maintenance of the group. No attempt at a
“scientific formula” for compensa- tion can therefore be completely
successful. The best possible compensation plan is of necessity a
compromise among the various functions and meanings of compensation, for
the individual as well as for the groups. Even the best plan will still
disorganize as well as organize, misdirect as well as direct, and
encourage the wrong as well as the right behav- ior.</p>
<p>Yet, there is hardly a more powerful signal for managers than
compensation and com- pensation structure. Its importance to them goes
far beyond the economic meaning of money. It conveys to them the values
of their top management and their own worth within the management group.
It expresses in clear and tangible form a man’s position, rank, and
recognition within the group. At today’s high tax rates a little more
money means, as a rule, very little to senior men. It is, in effect,
only so much more income tax to pay. But the status symbol of a little
more money and its emotional impacts are incalculable.</p>
<p>The most damaging misdirection may result from those apparently
eminently “fair”</p>
<p>compensation systems for the heads of decentralized divisions and
businesses which re- late a manager’s pay directly to performance,
usually to performance measured by return on investment during the
calendar year. If we want to measure performance, there is no other way.
The man himself and his associates, that is, the people in charge of a
decentral- ized business within a company, measure themselves by their
annual profit or loss. In fact, to have them do so is one of the major
reasons for decentralization. Yet, if return on in- vestment or current
profits are overemphasized, the managers of decentralized business will
be misdirected toward slighting the future.</p>
<p>An able management team heading one of the major divisions of a
chemical company failed for years to develop a badly needed new product.
Year after year they reported to their top management that the new
product was not yet quite ready. Finally, when the di- vision manager
was asked bluntly why he stalled on a project that was clearly vital to
the success of his business, he answered: “Have you looked at our
compensation plan? I my- self have a guaranteed salary. But my entire
management group gets its main income from a bonus geared to return on
investment. The new product is the future of this business. But for five
or eight years there will be only investment and no return. I know we
are three years late. But do you really expect me to take the bread out
of the mouths of my closest associates?” This story had a happy ending.
The compensation plan was changed—somewhat in line with the plan Du Pont
has had for years with respect to new developments. Du Pont does not put
the cost of a development into the investment base of a division or a
subsidiary until the new product has been introduced on the market. And
within a year or two the new product was out and selling.</p>
<p>The danger is beginning to be widely recognized. General Electric
Company, for in- stance, several years ago scrapped its compensation
system, based on the return on in- vestment of a division, and replaced
it by one in which return on investment is only one factor in the
compensation of divisional executives. Other factors that reflect
provisions for the future are also included in determining divisional
bonuses. This works quite a bit better. Still, nobody at GE considers
the new system to be perfect, if only because of its complexity.</p>
<p>The preference should be for simple compensation systems rather than
for complex ones. It should be for compensation systems that allow
judgment to be used and that en- able pay to be fitted to the job of the
individual rather than impose one formula on every-</p>
<p>body. But I would be the last person to claim that a “fair” let alone
a “scientific” system can be devised. All one can do, to repeat, is to
watch lest the compensation system reward the wrong behavior, emphasize
the wrong results, and direct people away from perform- ance for the
common good.</p>
<p>What Should the Objectives of a Manager Be?</p>
<p>Constant effort alone can counteract the inherent tendencies toward
diffusion and misdi- rection. The superior needs to understand what he
expects of his subordinate managers. The subordinate, in turn, needs to
be able to know what in the way of results he should hold himself
accountable for. Without special efforts, superior or subordinate will
not know and understand this and their ideas will not be compatible, let
alone identical.</p>
<p>Each manager, from the “big boss” down to the production foreman or
the chief clerk, needs clearly spelled-out objectives. Otherwise
confusion can be guaranteed. These ob- jectives should lay out what
performance the man’s own managerial unit is supposed to achieve. They
should lay out what contribution he and his unit are expected to make to
help other units obtain their objectives. Finally, they should spell out
what contribution the manager can expect from other units toward the
attainment of his own objectives. Right from the start, in other words,
emphasis should be on teamwork and team results.</p>
<p>These objectives should always derive from the goals of the business
enterprise. A statement of his own objectives based on those of the
company and of the manufacturing department should be demanded even of
the foreman on the assembly line. The company may be so large as to make
the distance between the individual foreman’s production and the
company’s total output all but astronomical. Yet the foreman must focus
on the objec- tives and goals of the company and needs to define his
results in terms of his unit’s con- tribution to the whole of which it
is a part.</p>
<p>The objectives of every manager should spell out his contribution to
the attainment of company goals in all areas of the business. Obviously,
not every manager has a direct contribution to make in every area. The
contribution which marketing makes to productiv- ity, for example, may
be indirect and hard to define. But if a manager and his unit are not
expected to contribute toward any one of the areas that significantly
affect prosperity and survival of the business, this fact should be
clearly brought out. For managers must under- stand that business
results depend on a balance of efforts and results in a number of areas.
This is necessary both to give full scope to the craftsmanship of each
function and spe- cialty, and to prevent the empire-building and
clannish jealousies of the various functions and specialties. It is
necessary also to avoid overemphasis on any one key area.</p>
<p>This is particularly important for service staffs and for such highly
specialized groups as the computer people. They may not always be able
to relate their work directly to busi- ness objectives and business
results. But unless they make the effort, they are likely to direct
their work away from business objectives and business results.</p>
<p>To obtain balanced efforts the objectives of all managers on all
levels and in all areas should also be keyed to both short-range and
long-range considerations. And, of course, all objectives should always
contain both the tangible business objectives and such “in- tangible”
objectives as manager organization and development, worker performance
and attitude, and public responsibility. Anything else is shortsighted
and impractical.</p>
<p>Management by Drives</p>
<p>Proper management requires balanced stress on objectives, especially
by top manage- ment. If avoids the all-too-common business malpractice:
management by crisis and drives.</p>
<p>That things always collapse into the status quo ante three weeks
after a drive is over, everybody knows and apparently expects. The only
result of an economy drive is likely to be that messengers and typists
get fired, and that 5,000 executives are forced to do 50-a-week work
typing their own letters—and doing it badly. And yet many manage-</p>
<p>ments fail to draw the obvious conclusion that drives are, after all,
not the way to get things done.</p>
<p>Over and above its ineffectiveness, management by drive misdirects.
It puts all em- phasis on one phase of the job to the detriment of
everything else. “For four weeks we cut inventories,” a case-hardened
veteran of management by crisis once summed it up. “Then we have four
weeks of cost-cutting, followed by four weeks of human relations. We
just have time to push customer service and courtesy for a month. And
then the inventory is back where it was when we started. We don’t even
try to do our job. All top management talks about, thinks about,
preaches about, is last week’s inventory figure or this week’s customer
complaints. How we do the rest of the job they don’t even want to
know.”</p>
<p>In an organization which manages by drives people either neglect
their job to get on with the current drive, or silently organize for
collective sabotage of the drive in order to get their work done. In
either event they become deaf to the cry of “wolf.” And when the real
crisis comes, when all hands should drop everything and pitch in, they
treat it as just another case of management-created hysteria. Management
by drive is a sure sign of con- fusion. It is an admission of
incompetence. It is a sign that management does not think. But, above
all, it is a sign that the company does not know what to expect of its
managers and that, not knowing how to direct them, it misdirects
them.</p>
<p>How Should Managers’ Objectives Be Set and by Whom?</p>
<p>The goals of each manager’s job must be defined by the contribution
he has to make to the success of the larger unit of which he is a part.
The objectives of the district sales manager’s job should be defined by
the contribution he and his district sales force have to make to the
sales department, the objectives of the project engineer’s job by the
contribu- tion he, his engineers, and draftsmen make to the engineering
department. The objectives of the general manager of a decentralized
division should be defined by the contribution his division has to make
to the objectives of the parent company.</p>
<p>Higher management must, of course, reserve the power to approve or
disapprove these objectives. But their development is part of a
manager’s responsibility; indeed, it is his first responsibility. It
means, too, that every manager should responsibly participate in the
development of the objectives of the higher unit of which his is a part.
To “give him a sense of participation” (to use a pet phrase of human
relations jargon) is not enough. It is the wrong thing. Being a manager
means having responsibility. Precisely because his aims should reflect
the objective needs of the business, rather than merely what the boss—or
he himself—wants, he must commit himself to them with a positive act of
assent. He must know and understand the ultimate business goals, what is
expected of him and why, what he will be measured against and how. There
must be a meeting of minds within the entire management of each unit.
This can be achieved only when each of the contributing man- agers is
expected to think through what the unit objectives are and is led to
participate actively and responsibly in the work of defining them. And
only if his lower managers participate in this way can the higher
manager know what to expect of them and can make exacting demands.</p>
<p>This is so important that some of the most effective managers I know
go one step fur- ther. They have each of their subordinates write a
“manager’s letter” twice a year. In this letter to his superior, each
manager first defines the objectives of his superior’s job and of his
own job as he sees them. He then sets down the performance standards
which he be- lieves are being applied to him. Next, he lists the things
he must do to attain these goals— and the things within his own unit he
considers the major obstacles. He lists the things his superior and the
company do that help him and the things that hamper him. Finally, he
outlines what he proposes to do during the next year to reach his goals.
If his superior accepts this statement, the “manager’s letter” becomes
the charter under which the man- ager operates.</p>
<p>This device, like no other I have seen, brings out how easily the
unconsidered and casual remarks of even the best boss can confuse and
misdirect. One large company has</p>
<p>used the manager’s letter for ten years. Yet almost every letter
still lists as objectives and standards things which baffle the superior
to whom the letter is addressed. And whenever he asks, “What is this?”
he gets the answer, “Don’t you remember what you said last spring going
down with me in the elevator?”</p>
<p>The manager’s letter also brings out whatever inconsistencies there
are in the demands made on a man by his superior and by the company.
Does the superior demand both speed and high quality when he can get
only one or the other? And what compromise is needed in the interest of
the company? Does he demand initiative and judgment of his men but also
that they check back with him before they do anything? Does he ask for
their ideas and suggestions but never use them or discuss them? Does the
company expect of a small engineering force that it be available
immediately whenever something goes wrong in the plant and yet bend all
its efforts to the completion of new designs? Does it expect a man- ager
to maintain high standards of performance but forbid him to remove poor
perform- ers? Does it create the conditions under which people say, “I
can get the work done as long as I can keep the boss from knowing what I
am doing”?</p>
<p>These are common situations. They undermine spirit and performance.
The manager’s letter may not prevent them, but at least it brings them
out in the open, shows where com- promises have to be made, objectives
have to be thought through, priorities have to be established, behavior
has to be changed.</p>
<p>As this device illustrates, managing managers requires special
efforts not only to es- tablish common direction, but to eliminate
misdirection. Mutual understanding can never be attained by
“communications down,” can never be created by talking. It can result
only from “communications up.” It requires both the superior’s
willingness to listen and a tool especially designed to make lower
managers heard.</p>
<p>Self-Control through Measurements</p>
<p>The greatest advantage of management by objectives is perhaps that it
makes it possible for a manager to control his own performance.
Self-control means stronger motivation: a desire to do the best rather
than do just enough to get by: It means higher performance goals and
broader vision. Even if management by objectives were not necessary to
give the enterprise the unity of direction and effort of a management
team, it would be neces- sary to make possible management by
self-control.</p>
<p>So far in this book I have rarely talked of control; I have talked of
measurement. This was intentional. For control is an ambiguous word. It
means the ability to direct oneself and one’s work. It can also mean
domination of one person by another. Objectives are the basis of control
in the first sense; but they must never become the basis of control in
the second, for this would defeat their purpose. Indeed, one of the
major contributions of management by objectives is that it enables us to
substitute management by self-control for management by domination.</p>
<p>To be able to control his own performance a manager needs to know
more than what his goals are. He must be able to measure his performance
and results against the goal. It should be an invariable practice to
supply managers with clear and common measure- ments in all key areas of
a business. These measurements need not be rigidly quantitative; nor
need they be exact. But they have to be clear, simple, and rational.
They have to be relevant and direct attention and efforts where they
should go. They have to be reliable— at least to the point where their
margin of error is acknowledged and understood. And they have to be, so
to speak, self-explanatory, understandable without complicated inter-
pretation or philosophical discussion.</p>
<p>Each manager should have the information he needs to measure his own
performance and should receive it soon enough to make any changes
necessary for the desired results. And this information should go to the
manager himself, and not to his superior. It should be the means of
self-control, not a tool of control from above.</p>
<p>This needs particular stress today, when the ability to obtain such
information is grow- ing rapidly as a result of technological progress
in information gathering, analysis, and</p>
<p>synthesis. In the past, information on important facts was either not
obtainable at all or could be assembled only so late as to be of little
but historical interest. This was not an unmixed curse. It made
effective self-control difficult; but it also made difficult domina-
tion of a manager from above; in the absence of information with which
to control him, the manager had to be allowed to work as he saw fit.</p>
<p>The new ability to produce measuring information will make possible
effective self- control; and if so used, it will lead to a tremendous
advance in the effectiveness and per- formance of management. But if
this new ability is abused to impose control on managers from above, the
new technology will inflict incalculable harm by demoralizing manage-
ment and by seriously lowering the effectiveness of managers.</p>
<p>Self-Control and Performance Standards</p>
<p>Management by objectives and self-control asks for self-discipline.
It forces the manager to make high demands on himself. It is anything
but permissive. It may well lead to de- manding too much rather than too
little. This has indeed been the main criticism leveled against the
concept. (See Chapter 19, especially the discussion of Maslow’s
criticism of Theory Y.)</p>
<p>Management by objectives and self-control assumes that people want to
be responsi- ble, want to contribute, want to achieve, and that is a
bold assumption. Yet we know that people largely act as they are
expected, to act.</p>
<p>A manager who starts out with the assumption that people are weak,
irresponsible, and lazy will get weakness, irresponsibility, and
laziness. He corrupts. A manager who as- sumes strength, responsibility,
and desire to contribute may experience a few disappoint- ments. But the
manager’s first task is to make effective the strengths of people, and
this he can do only if he starts out with the assumption that people—and
especially managers and professional contributors—want to achieve.</p>
<p>Above all, he must make this assumption with regard to the young
educated people of today who will be tomorrow’s managers. They may not
know what they mean when they demand to be allowed to “make a
contribution.” But their demand is the right demand.</p>
<p>And they are right also that management, as it has been practiced so
far in all institutions including business, does not act on the
assumption that the young educated people want to</p>
<p>make a contribution. They need to be subjected—and to subject
themselves—to the disci- pline and the demands of management by
objectives and self-control.</p>
<p>In the years since I first coined the term,* “management by
objectives” has become a widely used slogan. There is a whole
literature, and any number of management courses, seminars, and even
movies, on the subject. Hundreds of companies have adopted a policy of
management by objectives—though only a few have followed through with
true self- control. But management by objectives and self-control is
more than a slogan, more than a technique, more than a policy even. It
is, so to speak, a constitutional principle.</p>
<p>A Philosophy of Management</p>
<p>What the business enterprise needs is a principle of management that
will give full scope to individual strength and responsibility, as well
as common direction to vision and effort, establish team work, and
harmonize the goals of the individual with the commonwealth. Management
by objectives and self-control makes the commonwealth the aim of every
manager. It substitutes for control from outside the stricter, more
exacting, and more ef- fective control from inside. It motivates the
manager to action, not because somebody tells him to do something or
talks him into doing it, but because the objective task de- mands it. He
acts not because somebody wants him to but because he himself decides
that he has to-he acts, in other words, as a free man.</p>
<p>I do not use the word “philosophy,” lightly; indeed I prefer not to
use it at all; it’s much too big a word. But management by objectives
and self-control may properly be</p>
<p>*In Practice of Management.</p>
<p>called a philosophy of management. It rests on a concept of the job
of management. It rests on an analysis of the specific needs of the
management group and the obstacles it faces. It rests on a concept of
human action, behavior, and motivation. Finally, it applies to every
manager, whatever his level and function, and to any organization
whether large or small. It insures performance by converting objective
needs into personal goals. And this is genuine freedom.</p>
