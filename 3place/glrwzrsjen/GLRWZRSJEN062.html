<p>IBM’s Near-Miss—Ford, Siemens, ATandandandandT and Sears, Roebuck—The
“Identity Crisis” —Why Growth Is Not Automatic—Is Growth Necessary—The
Growth Craze of the Fifties and Sixties—Myths about “Growth Companies”
and “Growth Industries”— The Turbulence of Zero Growth—Growth in the
Public Service Institution—Growth as a Minimum Need—Preparing for
Growth—Top Management: The Controlling Factor—Staffing Key
Activities—The Symptoms of the Need for Change—The Top Man’s Personal
Decision—And His Responsibility</p>
<p>G</p>
<p>ROWTH IS NOT AUTOMATIC. It does not follow from success. Of course it
re- quires having the right products or services for the right markets
at the right time. But this is a prerequisite for growth, a necessary
condition, rather than growth itself.</p>
<p>Growth of a social organism such as a business is as much stress and
strain as growth is in a biological organism. It is discontinuity. At
one stage a business must change itself. And at that stage there is
usually the kind of identity crisis of which the modern psycholo- gists
speak when they analyze the transition from adolescence to adulthood. As
with hu- man beings, the ablest, the brightest, the most highly
motivated seem to suffer the worst identity crisis.</p>
<p>The best example is the story of IBM’s “near-miss.”</p>
<p>IBM’s Near-Miss</p>
<p>In retrospect, IBM’s rise from a fair-sized 00 million business
around 1950 to the billion computer colossus of the early 1970s seemed
smooth, trouble-free, and all but preordained. Actually, IBM went
through a severe identity crisis. It almost missed the computer
opportunity. It became capable of growth only through a palace coup
which overthrew Thomas J. Watson, Sr., the company’s founder, its chief
executive, and for long years the prophet of “data processing.”</p>
<p>Yet, if any company should have been able to grow smoothly and
without trouble, it was IBM. No other company in American business
history was so carefully prepared for growth, trained for growth, and
directed toward growth. And it was, from the beginning, to be growth in
data processing.</p>
<p>Thomas J. Watson, Sr., started before World War I by buying the
patents for the punch card, to which he added later patents for a time
clock. To convert the patents into a business proved painfully slow and
difficult. When World War II started, IBM was still a small and
struggling company, occupying a limited niche in the business equipment
field.</p>
<p>But long before IBM had established itself even in this small niche
Watson had begun to prepare the company for growth and for becoming a
big, indeed a very big, enterprise. He adopted a grandiose name,
International Business Machines, at a time when IBM was neither
international nor truly business machines. Long before any other
American com- pany thought of such things—even before Adriano Olivetti,
having inherited a small</p>
<p>typewriter company in northern Italy, adopted a similar course—IBM
created a company image through distinctive design and distinctive
typography for its products, its publica- tions, and its communications
inside and outside the company. Watson invented the slo- gan “THINK” and
distributed hundreds of thousands of “THINK” posters and stickers to
employees and customers.</p>
<p>From very early days Watson developed and trained a human
organization that would look upon itself as an elite corps and be
prepared to manage a very much bigger business. As has already been
related (in Chapter 20) he insisted that his workers take responsibility
for their own work and thus trained a whole cadre of proud and competent
men who be- came the skeleton around which the much bigger IBM work
force of later years was built.</p>
<p>Above all, Watson trained, and trained, and trained. All employees
were expected to continue to learn while on the job. But for the men who
were considered “IBM’s busi- ness”—that is, for salesmen, servicemen,
and sales managers, continuous training was a way of life.</p>
<p>The district sales managers, in particular, were trained to be top
executives. Not one of these men had technical education or technical
background. Yet when in the fifties and sixties the company switched to
advanced electronics from a mechanical appliance, the punch-card
sorter—in many cases still operated by hand or at the most by the
simplest of electrical motors—these technically unschooled men became
the management that built the world’s leading computer company. Having
grown up in continuous training, they had learned to learn. Into the
1970s, IBM’s top management was primarily staffed with former punch-card
district managers.</p>
<p>From early days Watson saw the future of IBM in what he may have been
the first to call data processing. He was convinced all along that the
day would come when a ma- chine would take over the tedious job of
handling large masses of data speedily, reliably, and at low cost.</p>
<p>Watson therefore saw at once what no one else at the time realized:
that the computer market would be in business. He saw that the key to
the computer business was not tech- nology but marketing. He saw that
what mattered was not what the computer could do but what the user could
get from it. On these basic insights IBM’s rise to dominance in the
computer field essentially rests—and they were Thomas J. Watson, Sr.’s
insights.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that Watson was an autocrat. He has been
harshly criticized for the conformity he imposed on his organization,
for his heavy-handed paternalism, and for his narrow prejudices. Yet, as
subsequent events showed, he did not stifle, let alone break, the
managerial people in his organization. Whatever his shortcomings—and
they were great—he had, from early days, a clear vision of the goal, and
the ability to think through what policies, what basic attitude, what
strategy would be required.</p>
<p>And yet Thomas Watson, Sr., almost destroyed the very opportunity he
had waited for, worked for, and built for. When the computer finally
arrived, and with it the realiza- tion of Watson’s dreams, he suddenly
did not want growth. He began to dither. He was afraid of doing anything
that might hurt the company’s punch-card business. And of course the
computer threatened—or seemed to threaten—the punch-card business alto-
gether. He began to sabotage manufacturing developments and selling
efforts that might replace existing or potential punch-card
installations; and that, of course, meant that he sabotaged all computer
development and all computer selling. He had been almost sin- fully
proud of his key people, and especially of his elite group, the district
sales managers. Now he suddenly felt that not one of them was “ready”
for a bigger or different job.</p>
<p>Above all, he refused to change his own behavior. He did not want to
become the chief executive officer of a big business. He was determined
to remain the owner of a small one. He did not want to let other people,
including his own two sons, take on any responsibility of their own or
make any decisions. He resisted anything that would have impaired in the
slightest degree his direct personal control of every aspect of the
business, or that would have made it difficult for him to know in great
detail everything that was going on. He stubbornly and with great
determination held on to a relationship to his company as his “own
child” and as an extension of his own personality.</p>
<p>Judging by the experience of other companies, Watson would have
destroyed IBM’s opportunity for growth had he remained at the head of
the company much longer. Even a few years’ delay would have been fatal.
By then, that is, in the early fifties, the first im- portant customers
would have bought computers and would have thereby designated the
leading companies. The first major new technical developments would have
had to be made beyond the early crude models. Considering how innocent
of technology Thomas Watson’s IBM was—the first engineer was not even
hired until the late thirties, and then for production engineering and
not for design—IBM could hardly have leap-frogged di- rectly into the
“second generation” computers of the early fifties in which transistors
re- placed vacuum tubes and electronic switches replaced mechanical
drives. If Watson had been permitted to stay for a few years, IBM would
at best have become an “also ran” in the computer business—and probably
not even that. It surely would not have become the leader in data
processing, for which he had prepared the company.</p>
<p>But then providence intervened in the highly improbable guise of the
Anti-Trust Divi- sion of the U.S. Department of Justice. At the very
moment when punch cards were losing their importance, the Anti-Trust
Division brought suit against IBM for allegedly monopo- lizing the
punch-card field. The one thing of which Watson was mortally afraid was
an antitrust suit. When still a young man, in the early years of the
century, an antitrust suit had almost destroyed him. Having been made a
scapegoat for serious antitrust violations of his earlier associates at
the National Cash Register Company, he had been sentenced to a stiff
term in jail and was rescued only by a presidential pardon. His panic
made it possi- ble for his closest associates, led by his two sons, to
force him to abdicate. The sons at once built a top-management team.
They concentrated the key resources, and especially the men Watson had
trained, on their new business. And within three years IBM emerged as
the leader.</p>
<p>The only thing that is atypical about the IBM story is the happy
ending. In the great majority of cases, the growing company that runs
into an identity crisis succumbs to it. In the great majority of cases
it loses its opportunity, no matter how badly it wants to grow— or says
it wants to grow. In the great majority of cases, the business then
remains stunted. Money is spent. Plans are made. But there are no
results. Instead of growth there is frus- tration.</p>
<p>And few companies manage to escape such an identity crisis.</p>
<p>At the Ford Motor Company the point where the company had to become a
big busi- ness arose during World War I. At that time Henry Ford’s
closest associates, his partner James Couzens and his brother-in-law and
financial advisor Ernest Kanzler, urged Ford to change the structure of
the company and the way in which he himself ran it. But Ford pushed both
men out of the company. Almost immediately the Ford Motor Company be-
gan to decline. Five years later it had been overtaken by GM, and
another five years later, toward the end of the twenties; it lost even
its number two position to a brash newcomer, Walter P. Chrysler, who,
apparently on Alfred Sloan’s advice, had organized his fledgling company
as a big business from the start.</p>
<p>Siemens (as was told in Chapter 29) went through a similar crisis
after the death of the founder when his sons refused to adopt the
structure, management, and policies appropri- ate to the big company
Siemens had become. Had they been allowed to go on, Siemens might well
not have survived, at least not as a major and important business.</p>
<p>ATandandandandT, the Bell Telephone Company, went through a similar
trauma. By the late 1890s, ATandandandandT had reached the point when it
could no longer be run as a financial holding company for a large number
of small and local telephone businesses. It had to become a large and
national company. Theodore N. Vail saw this clearly. He was then about
fifty and the company’s general manager, with the title of president.
But the company’s chief executives were a small group of Boston
investment bankers. When Vail came to them with his plans and proposals,
they refused to listen and forced him into early retirement. Ten years
later, however, their refusal to build the management the company
required had so weakened ATandandandandT that nationalization seemed
almost inevitable. The Bostonians then ate humble pie and implored Vai1
to come back and take over, this time with full power.</p>
<p>Within a few years Vai1 built the new structure of a big company
which enabled the Bell Telephone System to become the world’s biggest
privately owned business.</p>
<p>The most instructive example might, however, be Sears, Roebuck.
Richard Sears, whose name the company still bears, had pioneered many of
the fundamental policies on which the success of Sears is based to this
day. But when the company grew from a very small to a fair-sized
business, Sears refused to change the company and to change himself. As
a result, in the early years of the century, he nearly went bankrupt and
was forced to sell to a total outsider, Julius Rosenwald, a Chicago
clothing merchant. Rosenwald imme- diately organized a top-management
team and structured a big company. And Sears, Roe- buck, almost moribund
under its founder, started to grow. Twenty years later Rosenwald himself
realized that the company and its management needed to make another
quantum jump. Sears, already a big company, had to be ready to become a
very much bigger one. He turned to a total outsider, General Robert E.
Wood, who had proven his administrative capacity as quartermaster in
charge of supply for the American Army during World War I, and had then
become merchandising vice-president at Sears’s arch-rival, Montgomery
Ward. For a year or two Rosenwald watched from the sidelines. Then he
turned over the top job to Wood and withdrew, taking his own management
group with him.</p>
<p>In order to grow, as these stories show, there is need for strategy.
There is need for preparation. There is need for establishing an ideal
of behavior focused on what one wants to become. But none of this is of
much avail unless top management is willing to make the change. Even
great vision and high resolve will otherwise lead only to frustra- tion
and futility.</p>
<p>Is Growth Necessary?</p>
<p>The 1950s and especially the 1960s indulged in a veritable “growth
craze” in economy as well as in business. Growth was what the investor
was looking for to put his money in. Growth—on the order of “10 percent
growth in sales and 10 percent growth in profit each year”—was what
managements promised. And growth also was the focus of economics, both
in the developing and in the developed countries. In large measure this
was a reac- tion to the stagnation that had characterized world economy
and business in the period between the two World Wars. Then growth
seemed to have stopped. The best anyone could hope for was protection
against debilitating depression and decline. When the black mood of
frustration lifted after World War II, it was a tremendous relief. The
zest with which economy after economy and company after company
rediscovered growth was very healthy.</p>
<p>But the growth craze soon went too far. And where, before 1940, we
had believed the myth of stagnation, we soon began to believe myths
about growth. It is simply not true that an exponential rate of growth
can be maintained for long periods, let alone forever. A business that
grows at an exponential rate—let alone at so high a rste as the much-
proclaimed 10 percent each year—would soon gobble up the world and all
its resources. Growth at a high rate and for an extended period is also
anything but healthy. It makes a business—or any institution—exceedingly
vulnerable. It makes it all but impossible to manage it properly. It
creates stresses, weaknesses, and hidden defects which, at the first
slight setback, become major crises.</p>
<p>Even from the purely financial point of view of the investor
interested in capital gains, the growth company is not a sound
investment. Such a company sooner or later—and usually sooner—runs into
real difficulties. Sooner or later it runs into tremendous losses, has
to write off vast sums, and becomes, in effect, unmanageable. It takes
years then for such a company to regain its health and its capacity to
grow again and to produce profit. There are few exceptions to the rule
that today’s growth company is tomorrow’s problem.</p>
<p>The same vulnerability characterizes the “growth industry.” Indeed
the dynamics of a growth industry are perfectly well known—and they make
the growth industry a poor investment except for the most knowledgeable.
In the growth industry there is first the opening up of a new major area
of economic activity which promises to offer tremendous</p>
<p>opportunities. Any entrant into this new area of activity seems to be
doing very well. As a result, a great many new entrants clamor to get
into the act. Soon the industry is over- crowded. Inevitably there is
then a “shake-out.” Where there were thirty or forty entrants, only five
or six, maybe seven or eight, remain. Of these, three or four assume
leadership and retain it for many decades. Another three or four manage
to become respectable fair- sized businesses, occupying small but
distinct niches. The rest disappear.</p>
<p>But which companies will emerge as leaders in this process and which
will disappear is unpredictable. Even the insider has little chance to
guess correctly. The decisive factor is well hidden. It is, above all,
the capacity of a company’s management to manage for growth and to
develop the strategy that will give it leadership position in the
shake-out.</p>
<p>One example is the U.S. chemical industry in the period of its most
rapid growth, that is, in the twenties, when it first emerged as a major
American industry. Anyone who then tried to pick a winner would have
chosen Allied Chemical, which emerged from World War I as a very big
company with an almost impregnable patent position in the major areas.
It would have been a very rash man indeed at that time who picked either
Du Pont or Dow. These were, at best, minor companies in fringe areas
such as explosives or metal- lurgy. Yet Allied Chemical never succeeded
in building on its strengths. It had neither management nor strategy,
and floundered. Du Pont and Dow emerged as leaders.*</p>
<p>Similarly, few people in the early stages of the growth of the
American pharmaceuti- cal industry in the late 1940s and 1950s would
have been likely to pick the two companies that emerged as the winners
and as leaders in the industry, Merck and Pfizer. The former was
marginal, with no apparent strength in pharmaceutical research and
limited to a few rather unexciting patent medicines. The latter was not
even in the pharmaceutical industry but had been, for all of its long
and up till then undistinguished history, a local manufac- turer of
yeast for the New York breweries. In retrospect—but only in
retrospect—it is clear that these two companies had a strategy for
growth, and a management willing to structure a big company and change
irs own behavior.</p>
<p>The securities market would be well advised to put a discount on
growth stocks and growth industries rather than a premium. For growth is
a risk.</p>
<p>The idea that growth is by itself a goal is altogether a delusion.
There is no virtue in a company’s getting bigger. The right goal is to
become better. Growth, to be sound, should be the result of doing the
right things. By itself, growth is vanity and little else.</p>
<p>Growth in the Public-Service Institution</p>
<p>Growth crazes in the business world are a recurrent disease; in the
last century they have swept America, for instance, three times (in the
1870s, in the 1920s—at a time when Europe was in the grip of a
“stagnation craze”—and in the 1960s.) In public-service insti- tutions,
and especially in government agencies, the growth craze is, however,
endemic and permanent. This (as discussed in Chapter 12) is in large
part the result of dependence on a budget which makes the large staff
and the large budget the one generally accepted measurement of
performance, success and importance.</p>
<p>But bigger is also not necessarily better in a service institution,
whether a hospital, a government agency, a university—or in the
personnel staff in a business, or in its research laboratory.</p>
<p>The best example of the lack of any correlation between size and
performance in ser- vice institutions may be the two American
philanthropic foundations which respectively were first in size in the
decades before and the decades after World War II: the Rockefel- ler
Foundation and the Ford Foundation. By present-day standards the
resources of the pre-World War II Rockefeller Foundation were quite
modest—well below one billion</p>
<p>*Even the Du Pont management did not consider its company to be a
growth company at that time. The deci- sion to invest a large part of
the profits the company had made during World War I in General
Motors—which then, a few years later, led to GM’s reorganization and
subsequent rise—was made because the Du Pont top management (and
especially Pierre du Pont, the company’s chief executive) did not see
much growth opportu- nity for their company in their own industry.</p>
<p>dollars. Ford, by contrast, had almost three billions to spend. But
its limited resources forced the Rockefeller Foundation to keep its
staff small and to concentrate. Its impacts, as a result, were very
substantial—both in the field of medicine and in the sciences. Ford, by
contrast, was almost forced by the heavy weight of all the sums it had
to spend to look for projects that would absorb the most money—and how
much impact any Ford Founda- tion project has had so far is a matter of
considerable controversy.</p>
<p>But growth is also just as demanding and difficult in the
public-service institution as it is in a business. The larger budget may
make possible taking on new and important tasks—though often enough it
means only doing more of the things that need not be done at all. It
always, however, also means taking in people who have to be trained,
directed, supervised, and managed. It means additional complexities.
Above all, growth in the pub- lic service institution—including the
service staffs in businesses—also means that top management has to
change.</p>
<p>The public-service institution needs to pay the greatest attention to
“weight control”</p>
<p>(as said earlier, in Chapters 13 and 14). It is particularly prone to
mistake fat for muscle, weight for importance, and busyness for
achievement. But it also needs to know how to manage growth. And the
approaches to managing growth are essentially the same whether the
growing institution is a business or a service institution. For managing
growth is a top- management challenge and a top-management task and
requires, therefore, top- management strategy and top-management
organization.</p>
<p>Growth as a Survival Need</p>
<p>The growth craze had to come to an end like every mania. And yet
growth will continue to be a desirable and indeed a necessary business
objective. Even if the economy, as so many were predicting in the early
seventies, would turn to zero growth—thus returning, in effect, to the
stagnation of the twenties and thirties—there would be need for
management to understand how to manage growth. For, as the example of
the twenties and thirties clearly shows, a period of zero growth in the
economy is not one of stability. It is one of turbulence.</p>
<p>In a growing economy there is plenty of room. Industries that have
passed their peak decline slowly and are being held up by the overall
buoyancy of the economy. New indus- tries can grow fast. But there is
still room for those that do not know how to grow well and grow more by
accident than by management.</p>
<p>But when the economy as such does not grow, changes in the economy
are bound to be abrupt and sharp. Then indeed a company or an industry
that does not grow will de- cline. Then there is even more need for a
strategy that enables a management to plan for growth and to manage
growth.</p>
<p>Whether we are at the end of economic growth and will have to learn
to live in a “solid state economy”—if only because of the limitations of
the environment and of its resources—is not within the scope of this
book to discuss. It is not the most probable forecast, given the fact
that two-thirds of mankind still live in abject poverty. But growth in
the future may well mean different things. It may mean using fewer
resources, that is, a shift to growth in knowledge industries rather
than in manufacturing. Costs will be differ- ent; what we considered
free goods, such as air and water, will be anything but free and will
have a high cost attached to them. The pattern of development in
tomorrow’s fast- developing countries may well differ significantly from
the traditional nineteenth-century pattern with its emphasis on steel,
which still underlay the explosive growth of Japan after World War II
and the growth of Brazil in the sixties. Undoubtedly there will be
increasing need to guard and maintain the balance between what man takes
out of his environment and what he puts back. This alone will make
growth opportunities different in the future from what they have been in
the past.</p>
<p>But there will also be new factors pressing for growth. One that is
usually overlooked is the expectation of the young, educated people.</p>
<p>A company that is not able to attract, motivate, and hold men of
talent end compe-</p>
<p>The Need for Growth Objectives</p>
<p>But the collapse of the growth craze of the sixties showed that it is
not enough for a man- agement to say, “We want growth.” A management
needs a rational growth policy. A management needs objectives that are
based on more solid grounds than the desire to grow or the promise to
grow.</p>
<p>Management needs to think through the minimum of growth which its
company re- quires. What is the minimum of growth without which the
company would actually lose strength, vigor, and ability to perform, if
not to survive?</p>
<p>A company needs a viable market standing. Otherwise it soon becomes
marginal. It soon becomes, in effect, the wrong size. And if the market
expands, whether domestically or worldwide, a company has to grow with
the market to maintain its viability. At times a company therefore needs
a very high minimum growth rate.</p>
<p>In the pharmaceutical market or in the computer market in the fifties
and sixties, when the total market expanded at a fast clip, to stay even
meant very fast growth. In the textile industry in the developed
countries, there was little net overall growth of the market in the same
period (though more than is commonly believed). Here minimum growth
consisted primarily of identifying the most promising market segments
and of concentrating on them.</p>
<p>In GE’s strategic business planning (see Chapter 10) the first
question is not “What markets have the greatest growth potential?” It is
rather “What is the minimum growth of each market? Can we expect to keep
up with it? What market segments (even in the slow- growth markets)
offer the best opportunities for us?”</p>
<p>Growth in the context of a business is an economic rather than a
physical term. Vol- ume, by itself, is irrelevant. To use up more wood
each year may be a rational objective for the Gypsy Moth. It is an inane
objective for a paper company. What matters in a busi- ness—whether it
operates in a market economy or in any other economic system—is eco-
nomic performance, as measured by contribution to economy and society;
by productivity of resources—men, capital, materials; and by
profitability. A business grows if it grows in economic performance and
economic results. To want to be a “billion-dollar company” is not a
rational growth objective. Growth objectives have to be economic
objectives rather than volume objectives.</p>
<p>This is particularly important as the most dangerous mistake is to
confuse growth with putting on fat. A business actually grows if it
sloughs off activities which do not contrib- ute. Such activities only
drain. They impede the true growth potential. The second step,
therefore, in GE’s strategic business planning is to ask whether this or
that activity of the company should be closed down, sold, or at least
de-emphasized. When GE began to ask this question in the late sixties it
regained its capacity to grow after long years of relative
stagnation.</p>
<p>The second growth objective needed is an optimum objective. What is
the combina- tion of activities, products, and businesses that promises
to produce the best balance be- tween risk and return on resources? What
is the point, in other words, at which increased market standing can be
obtained only at a cost in productivity of every major resource and</p>
<p>of all resources, altogether? What is the point beyond which greater
profitability could be obtained only by a steep increase in risk? But
what also is the point below which a de- crease in risk is likely to
sharply curtail productivity and profitability—and also to endan- ger
market position?</p>
<p>It is this optimum point, rather than a maximum, which determines the
upper range of a company’s growth goals. Growth should be at least the
minimum growth. But it should, as a rule, not exceed the optimum.
Indeed, growth that exceeds the optimum, that is, growth that purchases
market position at the price of lower productivity, or growth that
purchases higher productivity at a price in market position, is
basically unsound and can- not be sustained. It is the growth that leads
to the costly “surprises” in the “growth com- pany.” It is the growth
that creates vulnerabilities, flaws, overextension, lack of control and,
fairly soon, a major, if not a fatal, setback.</p>
<p>A growth policy, in other words, is a business policy. It does not
differ from any other business policy. It requires objectives, it
requires priorities, it requires strategy. Above all, it requires that
growth goals be rational and grounded in the objective reality of a
busi- ness, of its markets, of its technologies, rather than in
financial fantasy.</p>
<p>The Need to Prepare for Growth</p>
<p>Growth requires internal preparation. Because IBM had prepared for
growth for many years, it was able to take off as soon as the dead hand
of the past had been removed. Without such preparation even the desire
to grow, even the understanding of what was needed for growth in the new
computer industry, would hardly have sufficed to turn, al- most
overnight, a maker of simple products without much engineering content
into the leader in a technically advanced industry.</p>
<p>When the opportunity for rapid growth will come in the life of a
company cannot be predicted. But a company has to be ready. If a company
is not ready, opportunity moves on and knocks at somebody else’s
door.</p>
<p>The IBM story shows that a company, to be able to grow, must, within
itself, create an atmosphere of continuous learning. It must be managed
in such manner that all its mem- bers—down to the lowest-ranking
employees—are willing and ready to take on new, dif- ferent, and bigger
responsibilities as a matter of course, and without trepidation. A com-
pany can grow only to the extent to which its people can grow.</p>
<p>Of course—at least in the West—one can bring in this or that expert,
this or that spe- cialist, this or that capacity, competence, or talent.
But fundamentally growth, even growth by acquisition (as has been said
earlier) has to come from within and has to be based on the strengths of
a company. A growth policy requires that a human organization establish
the atmosphere of continuous learning and acquire the readiness to do
different and bigger things.</p>
<p>Financial planning for the demands of a bigger business is also
needed. Otherwise, when growth comes, the company will find itself in a
financial crisis that is likely to frus- trate growth. This applies to
the small, but also to the fair-sized, business (see Chapter 54 on the
needs of the small and the fair-sized company). For even fairly moderate
growth soon outruns the financial foundations of a business. It soon
creates financial demands in areas to which no one, as a rule, has paid
much attention. It soon makes obsolete capital structure or existing
arrangements for obtaining short-term loans and working capital.
Financial strategy is essential to growth—as essential as product
strategy, technological strategy, or market strategy. But the key to the
ability to grow is a human organization that is capable of growth.</p>
<p>Top Management: The Controlling Factor</p>
<p>The controlling factor in managing growth is top management—again a
lesson of the IBM story. For a company to be able to grow, top
management must be willing and able to change itself, its role, its
relationship, and its behavior.</p>
<p>This is easily said—and very hard to accomplish. The very people—and
usually, the very man—of whom such change is demanded are also as a rule
the people to whom the success of the company so far can be attributed.
Now, when success is within their grasp, they are asked to abandon the
behavior that has produced it. They are asked to give up the habits of a
lifetime. They are asked—or so it seems to them—to abdicate their
leadership position. They are asked, above all, to hand over their
“child” to others. For growth al- ways requires that the management of
one man—or of a small handful of men—be re- placed by a genuine
top-management team.</p>
<p>Most top-management people in the growth company which somehow does
not seem to be growing—that is, in the great majority of small and
fair-sized companies with growth potential—know rationally what is
needed. But, like Watson, they lack the will to change.</p>
<p>Top management therefore has to start preparing itself for growth at
a very early stage. Specifically, it has to take three steps:</p>
<p>• It has to define the key activities and build, in effect, a budding
top- management team to take care of them.</p>
<p>• It has to be aware of the symptoms of the need for change in basic
policy, structure, and behavior so that it knows when the time for
change has arrived.</p>
<p>• It has to be honest with itself and decide whether it really wants
to change or not.</p>
<p>IBM worked for long years on making itself look like a big company,
internally as well as externally. It worked on its appearance to the
outside world, in the design of its products and in the design of all
the graphics with which it communicated to its own peo- ple and to the
outside world. It did not spend a great deal of money on advertising and
promotion. But when it did, it tried to make a “big splash.”</p>
<p>But at the same time, IBM was run internally on a basis of managerial
austerity. There were no staffs. There was no research and development.
There were no vice-presidents of this and that. There was a top man,
Thomas Watson. There was a strong field sales or- ganization. And there
was, as the only staff officer, an educational director. Even engi-
neering was unknown until the late thirties—which seems almost
unbelievable today.</p>
<p>IBM, in other words, had analyzed its key activities. It supplied
them with resources far in excess of what seemed appropriate to the
small company IBM still was in the late thirties and early forties. But
it did not do anything else.</p>
<p>There is a paradox to growth. “If You want to be a big company
tomorrow, You have to start acting like one today” is said to have been
Thomas Watson’s favorite aphorism. The company that wants to be able to
grow has to support the key activities or the level on which they will
be needed after the growth has taken place. Otherwise it will lack
compe- tence, ability, and strength in the areas in which it needs them
the most. But at the same time, such a company does not have the
resources. Only by starving all but the truly es- sential can it balance
the conflicting requirements of the present business, i.e., a business
with very limited resources, and those of the business of tomorrow,
i.e., a business that will demand fairly heavy support in major
areas.</p>
<p>One way in which the chief executive of a small or fair-sized
business that has growth ambitions can prepare himself for the day when
the company will have outgrown man- agement by one man is to build a
top-management team at the earliest possible moment. The one way in
which he himself can learn to be a true manager, rather than “the boss,”
is by analyzing first the key activities the business needs and his own
personality. There will always be key activities that do not fit the top
man, key activities which others can do better—and then others should do
them.</p>
<p>When Rosenwald took over Sears he analyzed the key activities and
built a top- management team of three people. As long as he stayed in
the company, he was the un- disputed leader and chief executive. But
from the beginning, decisions on the location,</p>
<p>organization, and layout of the mail-order plants—a key activity for
Sears in those days— were made by Otto Doering and not by Julius
Rosenwald. Basic decisions on finance and personnel were made by Albert
Loeb. Rosenwald was close to every decision. He did not hesitate to
express his opinion and occasionally to overrule his associates. But
these men, even in the fairly small company which Sears was in the early
days, were “associates” and not “subordinates.”</p>
<p>Similarly, the first thing George Merck of Merck andandandand Co. did
when, at the end of World War II, he decided that the pharmaceutical
industry would grow very rapidly and that his company would be a major
factor in it was to bring in Vannevar Bush as chairman of the board, and
as an associate. Merck knew that he and his company were innocent of
basic scientific knowledge and organized research. But he also knew that
this was a key activ- ity.</p>
<p>The top man—or the top men—in a company that has ambitions to grow
has to know when the time for a change has come. He has to know the
symptoms that indicate that a company has outgrown its traditional
structure, its traditional management behavior, and, above all, the
traditional role of the top man.</p>
<p>There is one reliable symptom.</p>
<p>The top man in a company—especially in a small or fair-sized company
that has been growing fast—is typically exceedingly proud of the men who
work with him. And yet— and this is the infallible symptom of the need
for change—not one of the “boys” is “quite ready yet.” When the time for
change comes, he always finds good reasons for not mov- ing this man to
that bigger responsibility, for not turning over a key area to another
man, and so on. He always says “so and so is the best man—but he is not
quite ready.” This is a clear indication that the top man himself is not
ready.</p>
<p>The chief executive, the top man, in the small and fair-sized—but
also in the big— company that wants to grow has to impose on himself a
change in his own role, behavior, and relationships.</p>
<p>The resistance of the top man to change is often blamed on his age.
Ford and Thomas Watson, Sr., were indeed well along in years when their
companies outgrew the way they were managing them; Ford was in his
sixties, Watson in his seventies. But the resistance to the change in
behavior, goal, and relationship which growth elicits from the top man
can be just as great among younger men. The Siemens sons were young men;
for instance; and so were the Boston bankers who blocked Vail at the
Bell Telephone System in the 1890s. On the other hand, many older men
are capable of imposing change on them- selves. Julius Rosenwald was
past sixty when he decided to bring in General Wood and step down. So
was George Merck when he decided his own role had to change.</p>
<p>A company may even be fortunate to have an old or aging chief
executive when the time for change in his role and behavior arrives. It
is much easier to get a man in his six- ties or seventies to step down
gracefully than to force out a man in his prime who is un- willing to
change.</p>
<p>What is demanded of the top man is indeed a great deal. He has to
accept that he no longer can be the virtuoso performer. Instead he has
to become the “conductor.” Where he prides himself, as did Thomas
Watson, Sr., on knowing everybody in the company, on knowing every
customer, on knowing everything that went on, and on making every deci-
sion and solving every problem, he now has to manage by objectives for
managers and through their self-control. Where formerly he was the court
of last resort—and very often the court of first resort as, well—he now
has to have a management structure. Where he “knows how to do
everything,” he now has to let people do it their own way.</p>
<p>To expect of anybody that he can make such a change suddenly is to
expect the mira- cle of conversion. And even conversions in retrospect
always have a long history of preparation. The top man who wants his
business to grow has to accept the role which he will have to play in
the bigger business long before it becomes a necessity.</p>
<p>First, he has to think through whether he really wants his company to
grow, and whether it is really capable of growth. A great deal can be
said for the “middle class” in business as well as in society. Not to be
a big company is often more enjoyment, more</p>
<p>satisfaction, and certainly, for the people at the top, a great deal
more personal achieve- ment and persona1 freedom. There is no reason to
believe that Luxembourg or Switzer- land is less happy, less achieving,
or less valuable to humanity than today’s superpower.</p>
<p>No company needs to strive to be “bigger” beyond the minimum growth
needed to stay abreast of its market. Growth beyond this must be based
on capacity to contribute. But a company that decides that it is happy
in its niche, satisfied with the contribution it makes and the market it
serves, and content with doing a good job is not, by this token, a “less
good” or a “less valuable” company. In economic terms it may well be—and
often is—a far more productive company than the giant. Growth as a goal,
to repeat, is delu- sion. William James, the American philosopher,
talked of the “bitch goddess success.” A philosopher of business today
might well talk of the “bitch goddess growth.”</p>
<p>But even if the top man decides that his company needs growth, he
still has a second question—and a more difficult one: “Do I want growth
of the business for myself?”</p>
<p>Thomas Watson apparently knew that he did not want to work in a big
company, even though his whole life was spent in building one. He
lacked, however, the wisdom or the strength of character to face the
consequences. Julius Rosenwald apparently did not. He realized that he
did not want to run a giant company. He also knew that Sears could and
should become one—and he knew the correct conclusions for himself.</p>
<p>The top man who concludes that his company needs to grow but who also
then real- izes that he does not want to change himself and his behavior
has, in conscience, only one line of action open to him. He has to step
aside. Even if he legally owns the company, he does not own the lives of
other people. A company is not a child—and even with a human child, the
time comes when the parent has to accept that the child has grown up and
needs to be independent and on his own.</p>
<p>A business is a human achievement. And a business, no matter what its
legal owner- ship, is a trust. The top-management man who realizes that
he does not want to change also realizes that he will stifle, stunt, and
throttle the very thing he has loved and built, his business. If he
cannot face up to the demands of his own achievement, he owes it to him-
self and to his company to step aside.</p>
