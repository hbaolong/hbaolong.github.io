<h4 id="design-logics-and-design-specifications">44 Design Logics and
Design Specifications</h4>
<p>The Five “Design Principles”—Is an Additional One Still
Unknown?—Limitations and Requirements—Formal
Specifications—Clarity—Economy—The Direction of Vi- sion—Understanding
of Task—Decision-Making—Stability and Adaptability— Perpetuation and
Self-Renewal—Operating, Innovative, Top-Management Structures</p>
<p>HE i.e.,</p>
<p>“ORGANIZATION ARCHITECT” has available today five design principles,
five distinct organization structures for the placement of activities
and the order-</p>
<p>ing of the relationships. Two of them are traditional and have been
known as princi- ples of organization design for many years: Henri
Fayol’s functional structure, and Alfred</p>
<p>P. Sloan’s federal decentralization.</p>
<p>Three are new, are indeed so new that they are not generally known,
let alone recog- nized as design principles: team organization;
“simulated” decentralization; and the “sys- tem” structure.</p>
<p>Each of these five was developed empirically and for specific needs.
The first impres- sion is therefore that they represent expediency
rather than design, let alone logic.* But, in reality, these designs
express different design logics. Each takes one generic dimension of
managerial organization and builds the structure around it.</p>
<p>Design Logics</p>
<p>Work and task are surely a generic dimension of management. And two
of the available design principles are structured around work and task:
the functional principle and the team.</p>
<p>These two differ in the way they balance “static” and “moving” parts.
In the functional organization “stages of the work,” e.g., manufacturing
and marketing, and “skills,” e.g., accounting, are designed as static;
the “work” moves from one to the others. In team structure the work is
conceived as static with “skills,” that is, individual manufacturing,
marketing, and accounting experts moving to form the specific team which
a specific piece of work, i.e., a “task,” requires.</p>
<p>Functional organization and team organization are commonly assumed to
be anti- thetic, with the “modern” team being opposed to the
“old-fashioned” function.</p>
<p>That the team is not “free-form” but a highly disciplined and highly
structured form, has been said earlier (in Chapter 41). But the belief
that these two are opposite is largely misunderstanding. In fact, they
are not even alternatives. For a number of design prob- lems one of the
two is the only appropriate design principle. For the biggest
organization problem, the structure of knowledge work, the two are
complementary.</p>
<p>Results and performance are as much a true dimension of management as
work and task. The two “decentralization” principles available, “federal
decentralization” and</p>
<p>*This was expressed most cogently by one of the most respected
organization theorists, Harold Koontz, in his article, “The Management
Theory Jungle.” Journal of the Academy of Management, December,
1965.</p>
<p>“simulated decentralization,” are built around this dimension. They
are “result-focused” designs.</p>
<p>Unlike functional and team structures they are, however, not
complementary. They are not even alternatives. Federal decentralization
is an “optimum,” simulated decentraliza- tion a “lesser evil” to be
resorted to only when the stringent requirements of federal de-
centralization cannot be met.</p>
<p>Relationships are also a generic dimension of management. The last of
the available design principles, “systems designs,” is
relations-focused.</p>
<p>Relations are inevitably both more numerous and less clearly
definable than either work and task, or results. A relations-focused
structure will therefore, of necessity, be both highly complex and
lacking in clarity. It will present greater difficulties than either
work-focused or result-focused design. But there are, as we shall see,
organizational prob- lems where the very complexity of relationships
makes “systems design” the only appro- priate design principle.</p>
<p>This rough classification indicates that at least one additional
design principle might yet be developed. Decision is as much a dimension
of management as are work and task, results and performance, and
relations. Yet so far we know no decision-focused design principle of
organization structure.* So far we have only theoretical speculation.
But a decision-focused design principle is at least a theoretical
possibility. If it were to be de- veloped into an operationally usable
structure, it might have considerable impact.</p>
<p>Because each of the available design principles structures around one
dimension of a multidimensional entity, management, each must have
limitations. Each must be the best available design principle for
certain structural tasks; usable, though with increasing inef- ficiency,
for others; and just plain wrong for yet a third group. Each must also
have its own requirements and make its own demands on management and
enterprise.</p>
<p>Formal Specifications</p>
<p>Any “structure,” by definition, has to satisfy requirements that have
nothing to do with the purpose of the structure but are grounded in the
nature of structure itself. Structures are “forms”; and forms have to
satisfy “formal” specifications.</p>
<p>Organization structure specifically needs to satisfy minimum
requirements with re- spect to: clarity; economy; the direction of
vision; understanding by the individual of his own task and the task of
the whole; decision-making; stability and adaptability; and per-
petuation and self-renewal.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Clarity. Each managerial component, and each individual within the
organization, especially each manager, needs to know where he belongs,
where he stands, where he has to go for whatever is needed, whether
information, cooperation, or decision, and how to get there. Clarity is
by no means the same thing as simplicity. Indeed, structures that look
simple may lack clarity. And seemingly complex structures may have great
clarity.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Gothic cathedral has great clarity; the modern office building
has practically none. In the Gothic cathedral everyone knows, without
being told, where he stands and where to go. Even someone ignorant of
the mysteries of the Christian religion would know immediately what the
purpose of the building is and how to relate to it. Yet the Gothic
cathedral is exceedingly complex, an expression of highly abstract
principles of metaphysics and esthetics, and endowed with a wealth of
adornments, allusions, and sym- bols. By contrast, the modern office
building is as simple as a structure can be: an assem- blage of cubes.
Yet no one in the modern office building can find his way without
instruc- tions—and even then it is easy to become confused.</p>
<p>A structure in which no one knows wittout an elaborate organization
manual where he belongs, where he has to go, and where he stands,
creates friction, wastes time, causes</p>
<p>*Herbert A. Simon and his school have been attempting to develop one.
At least this is how I read H. A. Simon, Administrative Behavior
(Macmillan, 1957 and J.G. March and H.A. Simon, Organization (John Wiley
andandandand Sons, 1958).</p>
<p>bickering and frustration, delays decision, and is altogether an
impediment, rather than a help.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Economy. Closely related to clarity is the requirement of economy.
The minimum effort should be needed to control, to supervise, and to
coax people to perform. Organiza- tion structure should make possible
self-control and should encourage self-motivation. And the smallest
possible number of people, especially of people of high-performance
capacity, should have to devote time and attention to keeping the
machinery going, i.e., to “management” and “organization,” to “internal
control,” “internal communications,” and “personnel problems.”</li>
</ol>
<p>In any organization some of the effort has to be directed inward,
some of it has to be used to keep the organization running and in good
repair. In organization as well as in physics, perpetual motion is not
possible; some “friction” is inevitable. But the less of the input of
the organization has to be used to keep it going or to lubricate the
friction points, the more of the input can become output, the more
economical the organization will be, and the more of its “inputs” can
become performance.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The direction of vision. Organization structure should direct the
vision of individu- als and of managerial units toward performance
rather than toward efforts. And it should direct vision toward results,
that is, toward the performance of the entire enterprise.</li>
</ol>
<p>Performance is the end which all activities serve. Indeed,
organization can be likened to a transmission belt that converts
activities into the one “drive”—performance. Organi- zation is the more
efficient the more “direct” the transmission is, that is, the less it
has to change the speed and direction of individual activities to make
them result in perform- ance. The largest possible number of managers
should perform as businessmen rather than as “experts” or “bureaucrats,”
should be tested against business performance and results rather than
primarily by standards of administrative skill or professional
competence.</p>
<p>Organization structure must not misdirect vision toward the wrong
performance. It should not encourage managers to give major attention to
the old and easy, but tired, products and businesses while slighting the
new and growing, though perhaps difficult, products. It must discourage
the tendency to cling to unprofitable products and businesses by letting
them ride on the coattails of the profitable lines. It must not make
effort more important than results and craftsmanship an end in itself.
It must, in brief, make for will- ingness and ability to work for
results rather than for the sake of the work itself, to work for the
future rather than rest on the achievements of the past, and to strive
for strength rather than to put on fat.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Understanding one’s own task and the common task. An organization
should en- able each individual, especially each manager and each
professional—but also each managerial component—to understand his own
task.</li>
</ol>
<p>This, of course, means that the work itself has to be specialized.
Work is always spe- cific. And one can understand only a task that can
be defined, a task in which what is needed to accomplish it is inherent
in the task itself.</p>
<p>But at the same time, an organization should enable everyone to
understand the com- mon task, the task of the entire organization. Each
member of the organization, in order to relate his efforts to the common
good, needs to understand how his task fits in with the task of the
whole and, in turn, what the task of the whole implies for his own task,
his own contribution, his own direction. Communications therefore need
to be helped rather than hampered by organizational structure.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Decision-making. None of the available design principles is
primarily structured around a “decision model.” Yet decisions have to be
made, made on the right issues and at the right level, and have to be
converted into work and accomplishment. An organiza- tion design,
therefore, needs to be tested as to whether it impedes or strengthens
the deci- sion-making process.</li>
</ol>
<p>A structure that forces decisions to go to the highest possible level
of organization rather than be settled at the lowest possible level is
clearly an impediment, and so is a decision structure that obscures the
emergence of the need for crucial decisions, or fo- cuses attention on
the wrong issues, such as jurisdictional disputes.</p>
<p>A decision is only good intention until it has been carried out in
work and action and has become accomplishment. No organization structure
by itself can make sure of this. But different structures can make it
more or less difficult for decisions to become organ- izational
commitment and individual work.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Stability and adaptability. An organization needs a substantial
degree of stability. It must be able to do its work even though the
world around it is in turmoil. It must be able to build on its
performance and achievement of yesterday. It needs to be able to plan
for its own future and continuity.</li>
</ol>
<p>The individual needs also a “home.” Nobody gets any work done in a
railroad station waiting room; no one gets much work done as a
transient. The individual needs to belong to a “community” in which he
knows people, in which he is known by them, and in which his own
relationship is anchored.</p>
<p>But stability is not rigidity. On the contrary, organization
structure requires a high de- gree of adaptability. A totally rigid
structure is not stable; it is brittle. Only if the structure can adapt
itself to new situations, new demands, new conditions—and also to new
faces and personalities—will it be able to survive. Adaptability is a
major requirement there- fore.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Perpetuation and self-renewal. Finally, an organization needs to be
able to per- petuate itself. It needs to be able to provide for its
self-renewal. These two needs entail a number of demands.</li>
</ol>
<p>An organization must be capable of producing from within tomorrow’s
leaders. One minimum requirement for this is, as said in the preceding
chapter, that it must not have so many levels of management that an able
man, getting into a management job early, say at age twenty-five, cannot
normally reach the top rungs of the promotion ladder while still young
enough to be effective.</p>
<p>What matters are not the number of levels at the very top. Once a man
has been pro- moted to general officer in the armed services, he is “at
the top,” even though there are three or four different “ranks” of
generals. What matters is the number of “levels” to be traversed until a
man reaches what in his organization is considered “top management.”</p>
<p>But more important than the number of levels are the experience and
exposure the or- ganization structure provides or desires. Organization
structure should help each man learn and develop in each job he holds;
it should be designed for continuous learning.</p>
<p>One self-renewal specification is the ability of an organization
structure to prepare and test a man on each level for the next level
above, and especially to prepare and test to- day’s junior and middle
managers for senior and top-management positions. For perpetua- tion and
self-renewal it is further necessary for an organization structure to be
accessible to new ideas and to be willing and able to do new things.</p>
<p>Operating, Innovative, Top-Management Structures</p>
<p>These “formal” specifications apply to any organization structure: of
the small business and the large one; of the simple business and the
complex one; of business enterprise and of non-business service
institutions.</p>
<p>They also apply to the three different kinds of management that have
to be structured and organized: operating management responsible for
performing the work and for pro- ducing the results of today’s business;
innovative management responsible for creating the company’s tomorrow;
and top management capable of directing, of giving vision, and of
setting the course for the business of today and the business of
tomorrow.</p>
<p>These are clearly conflicting specifications. No design principle
could fully satisfy all of them. Any organization structure that is to
be capable of performance and continuity will however have to satisfy
all these specifications to some degree. This means, inevitably,
compromises, trade-offs, balancing. It also implies that several design
principles rather than one are likely to have to be used even for simple
organization. For if any one of these specifications goes totally
unsatisfied, the enterprise will not perform. Organization build-</p>
<p>ing therefore requires understanding of the available design
principles, their requirements, their limitations, and their “fit”
against the design specifications.</p>
