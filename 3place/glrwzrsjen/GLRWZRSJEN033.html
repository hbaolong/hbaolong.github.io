<h4 id="the-manager-and-his-work">31 The Manager and His Work</h4>
<p>How Does the Manager Do His Work?—The Work of the
Manager—Information: The Tool of the Manager—Using His Own Time—The
Manager’s Resource: Man— The One Requirement: Character</p>
<p>Tbols of rank. It requires competence and performance of a high
order. But does the</p>
<p>job demand genius? Is it done by intuition or by method? How does the
manager do his work?</p>
<p>A manager has two specific tasks. The first is creation of a true
whole that is larger than the sum of its parts, a productive entity that
turns out more than the sum of the re-</p>
<p>sources put into it. One analogy is the conductor of a symphony
orchestra, through whose effort, vision, and leadership individual
instrumental parts become the living whole of a musical performance. But
the conductor has the composer’s score; he is only interpreter. The
manager is both composer and conductor.</p>
<p>This task requires the manager to make effective whatever strength
there is in his re- sources—above all, in the human resources—and
neutralize whatever there is of weak-</p>
<p>ness. This is the only way in which a genuine whole can be
created.</p>
<p>It requires the manager to balance and harmonize major functions of
the business en- terprise: managing a business; managing worker and
work; and managing the enterprise in</p>
<p>community and society. A decision or action that satisfies a need in
one of these functions by weakening performance in another weakens the
whole enterprise. A decision or action must always be sound in all three
areas.</p>
<p>The task of creating a genuine whole also requires that the manager
in every one of his acts consider simultaneously the performance and
results of the enterprise as a whole and the diverse activities needed
to achieve synchronized performance. It is here, perhaps, that the
comparison with the orchestra conductor fits best. A conductor must
always hear both the whole orchestra and, say, the second oboe.
Similarly, a manager must always consider both the overall performance
of the enterprise and, say, the market research ac- tivity needed. By
raising the performance of the whole, he creates scope and challenge for
market research. By improving the performance of market research, he
makes possible better overall business results. The manager must
simultaneously ask two double-barreled questions: What better business
performance is needed and what does this require of what activities?
And: What better performances are the activities capable of and what im-
provement in business results will they make possible?</p>
<p>The second specific task of the manager is to harmonize in every
decision and action the requirements of immediate and long-range future.
He cannot sacrifice either without endangering the enterprise.* He must,
so to speak, keep his nose to the grindstone while lifting his eyes to
the hills—which is quite an acrobatic feat. Or, to vary the metaphor,
he</p>
<p>*On this see also Chapters 4 and 10.</p>
<p>can afford to say neither “We will cross this bridge when we come to
it,” nor “It’s the next hundred years that count.” He not only has to
prepare for crossing distant bridges— he has to build them long before
he gets there. And if he does not take care of the next hundred days,
there will be no next hundred years—there may not even be a next five
years. Whatever the manager does should be sound in expediency as well
as in basic long- range objective and principle. And where he cannot
harmonize the two time dimensions, he must at least balance them. He
must calculate the sacrifice he imposes on the long- range future of the
enterprise to protect its immediate interests, or the sacrifice he,
makes today for the sake of tomorrow. He must limit either sacrifice as
much as possible. And he must repair as soon as possible the damage it
inflicts. He lives and acts in two time di- mensions, and he is
responsible for the performance of the whole enterprise and of his own
component in it.</p>
<p>The Work of the Manager</p>
<p>Most managers spend most of their time on things that are not
“managing.” A sales man- ager makes a statistical analysis or placates
an important customer. A foreman repairs a tool or fills out a
production report. A manufacturing manager designs a new plant layout or
tests new materials. A company president works through the details of a
bank loan or negotiates a big contract—or spends hours presiding at a
dinner in honor of long-service employees. All these things pertain to a
particular function. All are necessary and have to be done well.</p>
<p>But they are apart from the work which every manager does whatever
his function or activity, whatever his rank and position, work which is
common to all managers and pecu- liar to them. We can apply to the job
of the manager the systematic analysis of scientific management. We can
isolate that which a man does because he is a manager. We can di- vide
it into its constituent operations. And a man can improve his
performance as a man- ager by improving his performance of these
constituent activities.</p>
<p>There are five basic operations in the work of the manager. Together
they result in the integration of resources into a viable growing
organism.</p>
<p>A manager, in the first place, sets objectives. He determines what
the objectives should be. He determines what the goals in each area of
objectives should be. He decides what has to be done to reach these
objectives. He makes the objectives effective by com- municating them to
the people whose performance is needed to attain them.</p>
<p>Second, a manager organizes. He analyzes the activities, decisions,
and relations needed. He classifies the work. He divides it into
manageable activities and further di- vides the activities into
manageable jobs. He groups these units and jobs into an organiza- tion
structure. He selects people for the management of these units and for
the jobs to be done.</p>
<p>Next, a manager motivates and communicates. He makes a team out of
the people that are responsible for various jobs. He does that through
the practices with which he works. He does it in his own relations to
the men with whom he works. He does it through his “people decisions” on
pay, placement, and promotion. And he does it through constant
communication, to and from his subordinates, and to and from his
superior, and to and from his colleagues.</p>
<p>The fourth basic element in the work of the manager is measurement.
The manager es- tablishes yardsticks—and few factors are as important to
the performance of the organiza- tion and of every man in it. He sees to
it that each man has measurements available to him which are focused on
the performance of the whole organization and which, at the same time,
focus on the work of the individual and help him do it. He analyzes,
appraises, and interprets performance. As in all other areas of his
work, he communicates the meaning of the measurements and their findings
to his subordinates, to his superiors, and to col- leagues.</p>
<p>Finally, a manager develops people, including himself.</p>
<p>Every one of these categories can be divided further into
subcategories, and each of the subcategories could be discussed in a
book of its own. Moreover, every category re- quires different qualities
and qualifications.</p>
<p>Setting objectives, for instance, is a problem of balances: a balance
between business results and the realization of the principles one
believes in; a balance between the imme- diate needs of the business and
those of the future; a balance between desirable ends and available
means. Setting objectives clearly requires analytical and synthesizing
ability.</p>
<p>Organizing, too, requires analytical ability. For it demands the most
economical use of scarce resources. But it deals with human beings, and
therefore stands under the principle of justice and requires integrity.
Analytical ability and integrity are similarly required for the
development of people.</p>
<p>The skill needed for motivating and communicating is primarily
social. Instead of analysis, integration and synthesis are needed.
Justice dominates as the principle, econ- omy is secondary. And
integrity is of much greater importance than analytical ability.</p>
<p>Measuring requires, first and foremost, analytical ability. But it
also demands that measurement be used to make self-control possible
rather than abused to control people from the outside and above—that is,
to dominate them. It is the common violation of this principle that
largely explains why measurement is the weakest area in the work of the
manager today. As long as measurements are abused as a tool of control
(for instance, as when measurements are used as a weapon of an internal
secret police that supplies audits and critical appraisals of a
manager’s performance to the boss without even sending a carbon copy to
the manager himself) measuring will remain the weakest area in the man-
ager’s performance.*</p>
<p>Setting objectives, organizing, motivating and communicating,
measuring, and devel- oping people are formal, classifying categories.
Only a manager’s experience can bring them to life, concrete and
meaningful. But because they are formal, they apply to every manager and
to everything he does as a manager. They can therefore be used by every
manager to appraise his own skill and performance and to work
systematically on improv- ing himself and his performance as a
manager.</p>
<p>Being able to set objectives does not make a man a manager, any more
than the ability to tie a small knot in a confined space makes a man a
surgeon. But without ability to set objectives a man cannot be an
adequate manager, just as a man cannot do good surgery without tying
small knots. And as a surgeon becomes a better surgeon by improving his
knot-tying skill, so a manager becomes a better manager by improving his
skill and per- formance in all categories of his work.</p>
<p>The Manager’s Resource: Man</p>
<p>The manager works with a specific resource: man. And the human being
is a unique re- source requiring peculiar qualities in whoever attempts
to work with it.</p>
<p>“Working” the human being always means developing him. The direction
which this development takes decides whether the human being—both as a
man and as a resource— will become more productive or cease, ultimately,
to be productive at all. This applies, as cannot be emphasized too
strongly, not alone to the man who is being managed but also to the
manager. Whether he develops his subordinates in the right direction,
helps them to grow and become bigger and richer persons, will directly
determine whether he himself will develop, will grow or wither, become
richer or become impoverished, improve or deteriorate.</p>
<p>One can learn certain skills in managing people—for instance, the
skill to lead a con- ference or to conduct an interview. One can set
down practices that are conducive to de- velopment—in the structure of
the relationship between manager and subordinate, in a promotion system,
in the rewards and incentives of an organization. But when all is said
and done, developing men still requires a basic quality in the manager
which cannot be</p>
<p>*On this see also Chapter 39.</p>
<p>created by supplying skills or by emphasizing the importance of the
task. It requires integ- rity of character.</p>
<p>There is tremendous stress these days on liking people, helping
people, getting along with people, as qualifications for a manager.
These alone are never enough. In every suc- cessful organization there
is one boss who does not like people, who does not help them, and who
does not get along with them. Cold, unpleasant, demanding, he often
teaches and develops more men than anyone else. He commands more respect
than the most likable man ever could. He demands exacting workmanship of
himself as well as of his men. He sets high standards and expects that
they will be lived up to. He considers only what is right and never who
is right. And though often himself a man of brilliance, he never rates
intellectual brilliance above integrity in others. The manager who lacks
these qualities of character—no matter how likable, helpfu1, or amiable,
no matter even how competent or brilliant—is a menace and should be
adjudged “unfit to be a manager and a gentleman.”</p>
<p>What a manager does can be analyzed systematically. What a manager
has to be able to do can be learned (though perhaps not always taught).
But one quality cannot be learned, one qualification that the manager
cannot acquire but must bring with him. It is not genius; it is
character.</p>
