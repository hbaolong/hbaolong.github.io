<p>P</p>
<p>OLITICALLY, THE HISTORY OF THE BRITISH RULE OF INDIA is a history of
muddle, indecision, lack of direction and, in the last analysis,
failure. What kept the British in control and power for two hundred
years was, in part, India’s weakness and disunity. But above all, the
British stayed in power because of a supreme administrative
accomplishment: the Indian Civil Service. In its greatest period, the
second half of the nineteenth century, it never numbered more than a
thousand men. Most were very young, mere lads in their early twenties,
for life expectancy was brutally short for the white man in India’s
hostile climate, in which malaria and dysentery were endemic and cholera
an annual visitor.</p>
<p>Most of these young men of the alien race who administered the huge
subcontinent were stationed in total isolation in small villages or on
dusty crossroads in which they did not see for months on end anyone who
spoke their language and shared their concerns. Only a few survived long
enough to retire with modest pensions to the England whence they had
come and of which they always dreamed.</p>
<p>These young men who administered British India were rather dull and
uninteresting.</p>
<p>After a short apprenticeship, they were put into an assignment of
their own to sink or swim.* These men were younger sons of poor country
parsons, with no prospects at home and little standing in English
society. Their pay was low; and such opportunities for loot or gain as
their predecessors had enjoyed in the swashbuckling days of the East
India Company a hundred years earlier had, by 1860, been completely
eliminated by both law and custom.</p>
<p>These untrained, not very bright, and totally inexperienced
youngsters ran districts comparable in size and population to small
European countries. And they ran them practi- cally all by themselves
with a minimum of direction and supervision from the top. Some, of
course, became casualties and broke under the strain, falling victim to
alcohol, to na- tive women or—the greatest danger of them all—to sloth.
But most of them did what they were expected to do, and did it
reasonably well. They gave India, for the first time in its</p>
<p>*Leonard Woolf, who served as a young district commissioner in Ceylon
in the early years of this century, has given the best picture—both of
the isolation and of the challenges of the life—in one volume of his
autobiogra- phy, Growing (Harcount, Brace, 1962).</p>
<p>long and tragic history, peace, a measure of freedom from famine, and
a little security of life, worship, and property. They administered
justice impartially and, at least as far as they themselves were
concerned, honestly and without corruption. They collected taxes, by and
large, impartially and equitably. They did not make policy; and in the
end they foundered because they had none. But they administered, and
administered well.*</p>
<p>This remarkable administrative achievement, the achievement of a
middle manage- ment which, for two hundred long years, could in large
measure offset the top- management failure of the system—or rather, the
fact that there was no top manage- ment—rested on exceedingly simple
foundations.</p>
<p>The jobs the young men were assigned were big and challenging. There
was enough scope in each of them to keep even a good man interested and
occupied for many years. The job was the young man’s own job, and not a
job as an “assistant to” anybody. He was accountable. He was
responsible. And it was up to him to organize the job as he saw fit.
Performance standards were high and uncompromising. A young, basically
untrained and unprepared amateur was expected to give perfect justice;
to be totally impartial; to main- tain public order, safety on the roads
and in the villages, and religious and civil peace. And he had to do
this by persuasion, by the authority of his own person and by his mere
presence; to have to invoke force, for instance to call in the military,
was considered fail- ure. And while the individual job was anonymous,
the Service had high pride in itself and a deep commitment to standards
and mission. It was imbued with the highest spirit.</p>
<p>A manager’s job should be based on a task that has to be done to
attain the company’s objectives. It should always be a real job—one that
makes a visible and, if possible, measurable contribution to the success
of the enterprise. It should have the broadest rather than the narrowest
scope and authority. The manager should be directed and controlled by
the objectives of performance rather than by his boss.</p>
<p>The activities that have to be performed and the contributions that
have to be made to attain the company’s objectives should always
determine what managerial jobs are needed. A manager’s job exists
because the task facing the enterprise demands its exis- tence—and for
no other reason. The job has to have its own authority and its own
respon- sibility. For managers must manage.</p>
<p>The job should always have managerial scope and proportions. Since a
manager is someone who takes responsibility for, and contributes to, the
final results of the enter- prise, the job should always embody the
maximum challenge, carry the maximum respon- sibility, and make the
maximum contribution.</p>
<p>Common Mistakes in Designing Managerial Jobs</p>
<p>There is no formula that will guarantee the right job design for a
managerial job. Yet six common mistakes that impair the effectiveness of
manager and managerial organization can be avoided.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The most common mistake is to design the job so small that a good
man cannot grow. Any managerial job is, in al1 likelihood, a terminal
job—that is, a job on which the incumbent will stay until he retires.
Even in rapidly growing organizations this is the rule rather than the
exception.</li>
</ol>
<p>The number of jobs at the top is inevitably far smaller than the
number of jobs at the bottom. Out of every ten men on a given
organizational level, no more than two or three can normally expect even
one promotion. The rest are likely to stay where they are. They may get
a bigger title and, as a rule, more money. But what they do is unlikely
to change a great deal.</p>
<p>If a job is designed so small that the incumbent can learn everything
about it in a few years, the majority of managers will be frustrated,
bored, and no longer really working.</p>
<p>*The most perceptive book I know on the British in India, Philip
Woodruff’s The Men Who Ruled India (two volumes, St. Martin’s Press,
1954), makes the point that the basic failure of the British was their
belief in the “philosopher king,” that is, ther belief that
administration could suffice and could take the place of policy,
decision, and direction.</p>
<p>They will, so to speak, “retire on the job.” They will resist any
change, any innovation, any new idea, for change can only be a change
for the worse for them and threaten their security. Knowing very well
that they are not actually contributing any more, they are fundamentally
insecure.</p>
<p>Managerial jobs should, therefore, be designed so as to enable a man
to grow, to learn, and to develop for many years to come. There is
little harm, as a rule, in a job that is de- signed too big. This
mistake shows up soon and can easily be corrected. A job that is too
small, however, is an insidious, slow poison which paralyzes both the
man and the or- ganization.</p>
<p>Al1 managerial jobs should be designed to provide satisfaction
through performance.</p>
<p>They should in themselves challenge and reward. If the main
satisfaction of the job is promotion, the job itself has lost
significance and meaning. And since the majority of men in managerial
positions are bound to be disappointed in their hopes for promotion—by
arithmetic rather than by organization politics—it is unwise to focus on
promotion whether in compensation structure, in recognition, or in
manager development. The em- phasis should always be on the job itself
rather than on the next job.</p>
<p>In fact, there are few things quite as dangerous as an organization
in which promotions are so rapid as to become the accepted reward for
doing a decent jab. When this boom comes to an end, as all booms do
sooner or later, entire groups are bound to become dis- gruntled. The
men who rose fast but did not quite make it to the top will find
themselves boxed in behind men not much older than they are, who got to
the top by the sheer acci- dent of having started in the organization a
little earlier. The men who entered the organi- zation just before the
boom peaked will have expectations based on the careers of their
seniors, which are bound to be disappointed.</p>
<p>An extreme example is the situation of some of the large New York
commercial banks. Very few young people were hired in the banking
industry in the thirties and for- ties when commercial banks in New York
were shrinking rather than expanding. When the banking business expanded
again after World War II, a series of mergers (such as the one between
the Chase Bank and the Bank of the Manhattan Company, which created the
Chase Manhattan; or that between the National City Bank and the First
National Bank of New York, which created the First National City)
actually created a surplus of managers. By the early fifties, however,
large numbers of the men, who had started before 1929, reached
retirement age, and the banks began to hire large numbers of youngsters,
fresh out of college or graduate business school. Within seven or eight
years many of them rose to positions of substantial pay and exalted
title such as vice-president and senior vice- president. Before they
were thirty large numbers of these “young comers” reached, in other
words, what must be their terminal position. Yet—in large part because
these young men did not have much experience—these jobs, whatever the
big title and the good sal- ary, are quite limited in scope and
authority. By the time they reach forty, these men are going to be
bored, cynical, frustrated, and no longer excited about the job and its
chal- lenge.</p>
<p>A company that is expanding rapidly is well-advised to bring into
important positions a few seasoned and older outsiders, who have made a
career elsewhere. Otherwise it is bound to create expectations among its
own young managers, which, a few years later, it must frustrate.</p>
<p>The Importance of Age Balance</p>
<p>Another important reason why jobs and a job structure focused on
rapid promotion are to be avoided is that they result in an unbalanced
age structure. Both an age structure that is overbalanced on the side of
youth and one overbalanced on the side of age create serious
organizational turbulence.</p>
<p>The management structure needs continuity and self-renewal. There
must be continu- ity so that the organization does not have to replace
all of a sudden a large number of ex- perienced but old managers with
new and untried men. And there has to be enough</p>
<p>“managerial metabolism” so that new ideas and new faces can assert
themselves. A man- agement group that is of the same age is a management
group headed for crisis. Yet the management group that is uniformly old
may be preferable to the one that is uniformly too young. At least, the
crisis comes sooner and is over faster.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Worse even than the job that is too small is the job that is not
really a job, the job of the typical “assistant to.”</li>
</ol>
<p>The managerial job must have specific objectives and a specific
purpose and function.</p>
<p>A manager must be able to make a contribution which can be
identified. He must be ac- countable.</p>
<p>But the typical assistant does not have a job that can make a
contribution. He cannot be held accountable and his function, purpose,
and objectives cannot be identified. He is a “helper” who does whatever
the boss thinks he needs done or whatever the assistant can “sell” to
the boss. Such a job corrupts. The holder becomes either a wire-puller
who abuses his intimacy with an important executive or a toady who tries
to make his career by licking his boss’s boots. The assistant position
also corrupts the organization. No one ever knows what the role,
authority, and actual power of the assistant are. As a rule, other
managers will flatter him, use him, and exploit his insecurity of
tenure.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the title “assistant” has to be eschewed—the
reality should be avoided.</p>
<p>Also, a specific, detailed assignment for a young manager may be
excellent training.</p>
<p>But, preferably, it should be limited in time; after finishing one
such special assignment a man should normally go back to a regular
managerial job.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Managing is work. But it is not, by itself, full-time work. The way
to design a managerial job is to combine “managing” with “working,” that
is, responsibility for a spe- cific function or job of one’s own. As a
rule, the manager should be both a manager and an individual career
professional.</li>
</ol>
<p>A manager should have enough to do—otherwise he is likely to try to
do his subordi- nates’ work for them. The common complaint that managers
do not “delegate” usually means that managers do not have enough to do
and therefore take on the job the subordi- nate should be doing. But
also, it is rather frustrating not to have work ot one’s own— especially
for people who have grown up in the habit of work. And it is not
particularly desirable for a man not to have a job of his own. He soon
loses the sense of workmanship and the respect for hard work without
which, however, a manager is likely to do more harm than good. A manager
should be a “working boss” rather than a “coordinator.”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>As far as possible, a manager’s job should be designed so that it
can be done by one man working by himself and with the people in the
unit which he manages. It is a mistake to design a job so that it
requires continuous meetings, continuous “cooperation” and “co-
ordination.” There is no need, especially not in managerial jobs, to
provide for more “human relations.” The job by its very nature requires
far more human relations than most people are capable of. And one can
either work or meet. One cannot do both at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another mistake that is fairly common—and usually unnecessary—is to
design a job in which the incumbent has to spend a great deal of time
traveling. Just as one cannot meet and work at the same time, one cannot
travel and work at the same time. Person-to- person and face-to-face
meetings with colleagues, associates, subordinates, customers, and
superiors are absolutely essential. There is no substitute. But it is
far better to spend a substantial amount of time once every two years
with the managers and the main custom- ers of a subsidiary company than
to “commute”—that is, leave New York on Tuesday, spend Wednesday in
Paris, and be back on the job in New York on Thursday. This means only
that no work gets done for four days: one needs, after all, at least one
day to recover from this futile attempt to be in two places at once.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Titles should never be used as rewards, let alone to cover up lack
of function. Titles “in lieu of a raise” are not nearly as bad, nor as
common, as titles “in lieu of a job.”</li>
</ol>
<p>An example is the large commercial bank, both in the United States
and in Germany.</p>
<p>In the United States everybody has to be a vice-president or at least
an officer. In Ger-</p>
<p>many everybody has to be a Herr Direktor. There are reasons for this.
The customer of a bank, say, the head of a small business, will not
discuss his financial problems with any- body but an officer. But this
also deforms. It makes those who do not get the title, for instance
because their job does not entail close customer contact, exceedingly
dissatisfied. It adds greatly to the dissatisfaction of people who reach
the exalted title of vice-president at an early age and then find that
they are locked into the same humdrum routine for the rest of their
working lives.</p>
<p>One reason for the misuse of title has been discussed irr Chapter 30:
the tradition in business (but also in government) to use the
identification of function (e.g., manager of market research) as
indicator of rank. Another common reason is the narrowness of salary
ranges under many wage and salary plans; in order to give a man the
raise he has earned by performance it is necessary under these plan to
pretend that he has been promoted to a different and bigger job.
Finally, the traditional limitation of career opportunities in busi-
ness to managerial positions often leads to inventing a fancy and
managerial-sounding title (e.g., Coordinator of Materials Planning for a
senior purchasing clerk) for an experi- enced and accomplished
specialist, who continues, of course, to do precisely what he has been
doing all along.</p>
<p>The rule should be: for first-rate work we pay—and pay well. But we
change title only when a man’s function, position, and responsibility
change.*</p>
<p>Titles do create expectations. They do imply rank and responsibility.
To use them as empty gestures—that is, as substitutes for rank and
responsibility—is asking for trouble.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Finally, jobs that are “widow-makers” should be rethought and
restructured. In the heyday of the great sailing sltips, around 1850,
just before the coming of steam, every shipping company had a
“widow-maker” on its hands once in a while. This was a ship which, for
reasons nobody could figure out, tended to get out of control and kill
people. After it had done this a few times a prudent shipowner pulled
the ship out of service and broke it up, no matter how much money he had
invested in it. Otherwise, he soon found himself without captains or
mates.</li>
</ol>
<p>In many companies there are jobs which manage to defeat one good man
after the other—without any clear reason why. These jobs seem to be
logical, seem to be well con- structed, seem to be do-able—yet nobody
seems to be able to do them. If a job has de- feated, in a row, two men
who in their previous assignments have done well, it should be
restructured. It then usually becomes clear, though ony by hindsight,
what was wrong with the job in the first place.</p>
<p>A typical “widow-maker” has been the job of international
vice-president in a large American company. Nobody seems to know why the
job should not work, but in the great majority of cases one good man
after the other fails in it. The reason is usually that the company has
outgrown the volume of business which justifies treating “international”
as a stepchild. (On this, see Chapter 59, “The Multinational
Corporation.”) But this becomes clear only in retrospect, after one has
restructured the job and has found the man—or men—who can do the
work.</p>
<p>In a good many consumer-goods companies—Procter andandandand Gamble
is an example—there is a top marketing manager and a top promotion and
advertising manager, both members of the company’s top management.
Logically this should be one position since promotion and advertising
are part of marketing. These companies have learned, however, that com-
bining these two functions into one job usually means frustrating and
defeating a good man. The reason, as one consumer-goods executive once
put it, is that “marketing aims at moving goods, promotion aims at
moving people.” These two aims require men of differ-</p>
<p>*I would exempt from the rule “honorifics” that primarily bespeak
seniority such as “junior” and “senior,” especially for individual
career professionals but would then strongly insist that such titles be
used only to denote seniority—more or less in the fashion in which the
title monsignor in the Catholic Church (at least in the U.S.) is almost
automatically bestowed on any man who has served twenty-five years in
the priesthood and stayed out of trouble.</p>
<p>ent temperament who look at their work differently and apply
different measurements of performance to themselves and to their
units.</p>
<p>The “widow-maker” job is usually the result of accident. One man who
somehow combined in himself temperamental characteristics which are not
usually found in one person, created the job and acquitted himself well.
In other words, what looked like a logical job was an accident of
personality rather than the result of a genuine function. But</p>
<p>one cannot replace personality.</p>
<p>Job Structure and Personality</p>
<p>The abuse of titles and the “widow-maker” job relate closely to one
of the most hotly de- bated issues with respect to managerial jobs and
managerial structure: Should the organi- zation be structured so that
jobs fit people? Or should the organization be “functional,” with people
fitted to jobs?</p>
<p>As commonly propounded, this is a pseudo-problem. Quite obviously,
people have to fill the jobs, and therefore jobs have to fit people. We
will indeed have to design jobs that really fit people, answer their
needs, and fulfill their expectations. We will, increasingly, see
“organization planning” in large companies, that is, attempts to make
jobs fit people and serve them.</p>
<p>There is also no doubt that organization structure has to be
impersonal and task- focused. Otherwise it is impossible to have
continuity and to have people succeed each other. If the job is designed
for an individual rather than for a task, it has to be restruc- tured
every time there is a change in the incumbent. And, as experienced
managers know, one cannot restructure one job. There is a true “domino
effect,” a true chain reaction. Re- structuring a job usually means
restructuring a score of jobs, moving people around, and upsetting
everybody.</p>
<p>There is one exception: the exceedingly rare, truly exceptional man
for whose sake the rule should be broken.</p>
<p>Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., the architect of General Motors, was adamant
that jobs had to be impersonal and task-focused.* But he made one
exception fo accommodate one of the great inventors of our century,
Charles F. Kettering. Kettering was an exceedingly diffi- cult man, and
also a man who disregarded every single organizational rule. Yet his
inven- tions, from the self-starter to the redesign of the diesel
engine, were of major importance. Sloan offered to set up Kettering as
an independent researcher. But Kettering wanted to be vice-president and
a “big businessman.” Sloan gave in, but the moment Kettering re- tired,
the job was redesigned—from “resident genius” to manager of a large
research laboratory.</p>
<p>The design of a job has to start out with the task, but it also has
to be a design that can accommodate people with different temperaments,
habits, and behavior patterns. This is a major reason why managerial
jobs ought to be designed big rather than small. A job has to be big
enough so that a good man can find within it his own satisfaction and
achieve- ment, his own way and method of working.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church offers an instructive lesson. The basic manager
within the Catho- lic Church is the bishop. It has long been the custom
to rotate temperaments in filling a bishop’s See. If the incumbent is a
pastor, concerned primarily with the care of souls, he may be succeeded
by a theologian or by an administrator. In turn, a first-rate
administra- tor is likely to be succeeded by a man whose main emphasis
is on his priestly function, and so on. The Catholic Church learned long
ago that the three qualifications—those of pastor, theologian, and
administrator—are unlikely fo be found in one person. Yet all three are
needed to keep a diocese alive. Hence the bishop’s job is designed very
big in- deed—big enough for a good man to make of it what suits him. And
the standard of ac- complishment is set by rotating the temperaments
that occupy the See in succession.</p>
<p>*See Sloan’s book, My Years with General Motors.</p>
<p>The Span of Managerial Relationships</p>
<p>In discussing how big a manager’s job should be, the textbooks often
start out with the observation that one man can supervise only a very
small number of people—the so- called span of control. This in turn
leads to that deformation of management: levels upon levels which impede
cooperation and communication, stifle the development of tomor- row’s
managers, and erode the meaning of the management job.</p>
<p>In the first place, the principle of the span of control is rarely
cited properly. It is not how many people report to a manager that
matters. It is how many people who have to work with each other report
to a manager. What counts are the number of relationships rather than
the number of men.</p>
<p>The president of a company who has reporting to him a number of
senior executives, each concerned with a major function, should indeed
keep the number of direct subordi- nates to a fairly low number—between
eight and twelve is probably the limit. For these men—the chief
financial officer, the head of manufacturing, the head of marketing, and
so on—have to work every day with each other and with the company’s
president. If they do not work together, they do not work at all.
Therefore, the president is engaged in a great many relationships even
though the number of direct subordinates may be quite small.</p>
<p>By contrast, a regional vice-president of Sears, Roebuck can—and
does—have several hundred store managers report to him. Each store is
discrete and autonomous. There is no need whatever for interaction
between two different stores. All the stores do the same kind of work
and have the same job. They can all be appraised and measured by the
same yardsticks. Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of store
managers a regional vice-president of Sears can manage and supervise.
The limit is set by geography rather than by the span of control.</p>
<p>The second shortcoming of the span of control argument is that it
assumes that a man- ager’s main relationship is downward. But this is
only one dimension. The manager, in the traditional definition as the
man responsible for the work of other people, has a downward
relationship, to be sure. But every manager and every career
professional also has a superior. Indeed many managers, no matter what
the organization chart says, have more than one boss. And the upward
relationship to the superior is at least equal in impor- tance to the
downward relationship to the subordinates. Most important, however,
manag- ers and career professionals always have sideways relations,
relationships with people who are neither their subordinates nor their
superiors and, indeed, stand in no relationship of authority and
responsibility to them. Yet these relationships are crucial both for the
manager’s own ability to do his work, and for the effectiveness of his
work.</p>
<p>For example, the most important relationships for managers and career
professionals in accounting are not the relationships to the company
controller or to the junior account- ants. They are their relationships
to operating managers. The accounting manager’s con- tribution depends
on the ability and willingness of the operating managers to use as in-
formation and input what accounting produces. Conversely, the accounting
manager’s ability to perform depends on the willingness and ability of
the operating managers to</p>
<p>furnish him the information he needs. Yet accounting people, as a
rule, slight this rela- tionship no matter how much lip service they may
pay to it.</p>
<p>Similarly, the basic weakness of a good many research managers and
scientists is the neglect of their sideways relationships, especially
their relationships with the marketing people. As a result, research
quite often is uninformed regarding the needs and opportuni- ties of the
company and, conversely, valuable results of research remain unused
because the marketing people simply do not understand what research is
trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>What is needed, therefore, is to replace the concept of the span of
control with another and more relevant concept: the span of managerial
relationships.</p>
<p>We do not know how wide this span can be—though, assuredly, there are
limits. But we do know that the span of managerial relationships is
crucial in the design of a manage- rial job.</p>
<p>In the first place, these relationships define the place of the
manager within the mana- gerial structure. Second, they very largely
define what his job is—for these relationships are a crucial and
essential part of the job content. Finally, they do set limits—since a
job that is only “relationships” and no “work” is not a job at all. In
designing managerial jobs it is as important to think through the
managerial relationships and to make sure that they do not exceed an
individual’s grasp as it is to think through the specific function.</p>
<p>Again it is better to make the span of managerial responsibilities
too wide than too narrow. This goes for the number of subordinates with
whom a manager works and who constitute his unit and his team. It goes
also for his upward relationships. The only area in which I would
strongly counsel to keep rather tight limits on the span of managerial
rela- tionships are the sideways relationships. A managerial job,
ideally, should have a small number of sideways relationships—every one
of them of prime importance, both for the functioning of the entire
organization and for the achievement of the manager’s own func- tion and
objectives. It is not only that these are time-consuming relationships.
If there are too many, they will be treated superficially, will not be
thought through, and will not be worked at. And the common weakness of
many organizations is, by and large, the lack of adequate concern for,
and adequate work on, sideways relationships.</p>
<p>Defining a Manager’s Job</p>
<p>A manager’s job is defined in several ways.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is first the specific function, the job itself. This should
always be a perma- nent, continuing job, one that is considered, in the
light of the best available knowledge at the time, to be needed for a
good long time to come. An example would be manager of market research
or manufacturing manager. Both obviously are jobs which will have to be
done for the foreseeable future.</p></li>
<li><p>But the functional definition of the job, which is what is
expressed in the typical job description or position guide, does not
define the specific contribution which a specific manager is expected to
make. While the function is, at least in intent, permanent, there are
assignments “here and now” which are what the enterprise and the
manager’s boss should hold the man accountable for. They contribute the
second definition of a managerial posi- tion and job.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As I have said elsewhere, every manager should ask himself the
question at least once a year, and always when taking on a new job:
“What specific contribution can I and my unit make which, if done really
well, would make a substantial difference to the perform- ance and
results of my company?”*</p>
<p>The position guide and job description are, so to speak, the mission
statement of a managerial job. They correspond to the definition of
“what is our business and what should it be for the enterprise as a
whole. The assignments are the objectives and goals and therefore need
specific targets, a deadline, a clear statement of who is accountable,
and a built-in measurement by feedback from results.</p>
<p>*In my book, The Effective Executive.</p>
<p>Every manager should ask himself: “What information do I need to do
my job and where do I get it?” He should make sure that whoever has to
provide that information understands the manager’s needs—not only in
terms of what is needed but also how it is needed.</p>
<p>This is particularly important today, when “management information”
means increas- ingly “computer.” The basic problem with the computer in
business is not that computer technicians do not understand the
managers’ needs. It is that the managers do not take the time and
trouble to think through their needs and to communicate them to the
computer people.* How the computer people satisfy the needs of the
manager is their business. What the needs are is the manager’s business.
To expect the computer people to define the information needs of the
managers is abdication.</p>
<p>Managers need to think through the question “And who depends on
information from me, and in what form, upward, downward, and
sideways?”</p>
<p>Each of these four definitions of the managerial job is only a
partial definition. All four are needed to define the manager’s job—just
as one triangulates a position on a map.</p>
<p>These four definitions which “triangulate” a manager’s job are the
manager’s own re- sponsibility. He should be expected to write his own
job description; to work out his own proposal for the results and
contributions for which he and his unit should be accountable; to work
out and think through his relationships; and finally to define both his
information needs and his information contribution. Indeed,
responsibility for thinking through the four dimensions of his job is a
manager’s first responsibility, of which he should never be relieved.
His superior has both the duty and the responsibility to approve or to
disapprove what the individual manager proposes. But the responsibility
for thinking and proposing is the manager’s. There is no difference
between a “managing” job, i.e., one with direct responsibility for the
work of other people, and a job as a career professional.</p>
<p>The Manager’s Authority</p>
<p>That each manager’s job be given the broadest possible scope and
authority is nothing but a rephrasing of the rule that decisions be
pushed down the line as far as possible and be taken as close as
possible to the action to which they apply. In its effects, however,
this requirement leads to sharp deviations from the traditional concept
of delegation from above.</p>
<p>What activities and tasks the enterprise requires is worked out at
the top. The analysis begins with the desired end product: the
objectives of business performance and business results. From these the
analysis determines step by step what work has to be performed.</p>
<p>But in organizing the manager’s job we have to work from the bottom
up. We have to begin with the activities on the “firing line”—the jobs
responsible for the actual output of goods and services, for the final
sale to the customer, for the production of blueprints and engineering
drawings.</p>
<p>The managers on the firing line have the basic management jobs—the
ones on whose performance everything else ultimately rests. Seen this
way, the jobs of higher manage- ment are derivative, are, in the last
analysis, aimed at helping the firing-line manager do his job. Viewed
structurally and organically, it is the firing-line manager in whom all
au- thority and responsibility center; only what he cannot do himself
passes up to higher man-</p>
<p>*On this see also Chapters 38 and 40.</p>
<p>agement. He is, so to speak, the gene of organization in which all
higher organs are pre- figured and out of which they are developed.</p>
<p>Quite obviously there are real limits to the decisions the
firing-line manager can or should make, and to the authority and
responsibility he should have.</p>
<p>He is limited as to the extent of his authority. A production foreman
has no business changing a salesman’s compensation. A regional sales
manager has no authority in some- body else’s region, etc. A manager is
also limited with respect to the kind of decision he can make. Clearly,
he should not make decisions that affect other managers. He should not
alone make decisions that affect the whole business and its spirit. It
is only elementary prudence, for instance, not to allow any manager to
make by himself and without review a decision on the career and future
of one of his subordinates.</p>
<p>The firing-line manager should not be expected to make decisions
which he cannot make. A man responsible for immediate performance does
not have the time, for instance, to make long-range decisions. A
production man lacks the knowledge and competence to work out a pension
plan or a medical program. These decisions certainly affect him and his
operations; he should know them, understand them, indeed participate as
much as is humanly possible in their preparation and formulation. But he
cannot make them. Hence he cannot have the authority and responsibility
for them; for authority and responsibility should always be
task-focused. This applies all through the management hierarchy up to
the chief executive himself.</p>
<p>of the old Prussian idea of a citizen’s rights: “Everything that is
not expressly ordered is forbidden.” In other words, the decisions which
a manager is not entitled to make within the extent of his task should
always be spelled out; for all others he should be supposed to have
authority and responsibility.</p>
<p>The Manager, His Superiors, His Subordinates, and the Enterprise</p>
<p>The manager’s relationship to his superior and his relationship to
his subordinate are two- way relationships. Both are formal and informal
relationships of authority as well as of information. Both are
relationships of mutual dependence.*</p>
<p>Every manager has the task of contributing what his superior’s unit
needs to attain its objectives. Every manager should think through what
he and his unit need to do—and in what manner—to make his superior
perform and achieve.</p>
<p>The manager has responsibilities downward, to his subordinates. He
has first to make sure that they know and understand what is demanded of
them. He has to help them set their own objectives. Then he has to help
them to reach these objectives. He is responsi- ble for their getting
the tools, the staff, the information they need. He has to help them
with advice and counsel, and, if need be, to teach them how to do
better. If a one-word definition of this downward relationship be
desired, “assistance” would come closest.</p>
<p>The objectives of a managerial unit should always consist of the
performance that it has to contribute to the success of the enterprise.
Objectives should always and exclu- sively focus upward.</p>
<p>But the objectives of the manager who heads the units include what he
himself has to do to help his subordinates attain their objectives. The
vision of a manager should always be upward—toward the enterprise as a
whole. But his responsibility runs downward as well—to the men on his
team. That this relationship toward them be clearly understood as duty
toward them and as responsibility for making them perform and achieve
rather than as “supervision” is a central requirement for organizing the
manager’s unit effectively.</p>
<p>*This Japan understands much better than the West does, if only
because Japan did not take its concepts of organization from the
militaty, as we did in the West. On this see Chie Nakarne, op. cit.</p>
<p>The final duty of the manager is toward the enterprise. For his job
and function are grounded in the objective needs of the enterprise
rather than in title or delegation of</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>Each manager, therefore, has to derive from the objectives of the
enterprise the defini- tion of his own objectives and those of the unit
he heads.</p>
<p>The discussion in this chapter has focused on the manager in business
enterprise. But eve- rything said here applies just as much to the
manager in the public-service institution, and especially to the manager
in the government agency. He needs a job big enough for a good man to
grow in. He needs satisfaction through performance rather than through
promotion or title. His job needs to be designed around job and
position; assignments; relationships; and information needs. He needs
authority to do his task. And he has to derive his own objectives from
those of the institution he serves.</p>
<p>Indeed, as has been said before (in Chapters 11 through 14), the
manager in the pub- lic-service institution needs proper job design,
proper job content, and proper job struc- ture even more than the
manager in a business. Yet, few public-service institutions seem to pay
much attention to managerial jobs; their emphasis tends to be on title
rather than on function, on procedure rather than on performance. The
design of truly managerial jobs is the first—but may also be the
biggest—step toward improving both performance and mo- rale in
public-service institutions.</p>
