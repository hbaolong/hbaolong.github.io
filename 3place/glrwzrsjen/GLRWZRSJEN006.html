<h4 id="the-dimensions-of-management">4 The Dimensions of
Management</h4>
<p>Management Is an Organ—It Exists Only in Contemplation of
Performance—The Three Primary Tasks: Economic Performance; Making Work
Productive and the Worker Achieving; Managing Social Impacts and Social
Responsibilities—The Time Dimensions—Administration and
Entrepreneurship—Efficiency and Effectiveness— Optimization and
Innovation—The Specific Work of Management: Managing Man- agers—Focus on
Tasks</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>usiness enterprises—and public-service institutions as well—are
organs of society. They do not exist for their own sake, but to fulfill
a specific social purpose and to satisfy a specific need of society,
community, or individual. They are not ends in themselves, but means.
The right question to ask in respect to them is not, What are they? but,
What are they supposed to be doing and what are their tasks?</p>
<p>Management, in turn, is the organ of the institution. It has no
function in itself, indeed, no existence in itself. Management divorced
from the institution it serves is not manage- ment.</p>
<p>What people mean by bureaucracy, and rightly condemn, is a management
that has come to misconceive itself as an end and the institution as a
means. This is the degenera- tive disease to which managements are
prone, and especially those managements that do not stand under the
discipline of the market test. To prevent this disease, to arrest it,
and, if possible, to cure it, must be a first purpose of any effective
manager—but also of an effective book on management.</p>
<p>The question, What is management? comes second. First we have to
define manage- ment in and through its tasks.</p>
<p>There are three tasks, equally important but essentially different,
which management has to perform to enable the institution in its charge
to function and to make its contribu- tion:</p>
<p>• the specific purpose and mission of the institution, whether
business enter- prise, hospital, or university;</p>
<p>• making work productive and the worker achieving;</p>
<p>• managing social impacts and social responsibilities.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Purpose and Mission</li>
</ol>
<p>An institution exists for a specific purpose and mission, a specific
social function. In the business enterprise this, means economic
performance.</p>
<p>With respect to this first task, the task of specific performance,
business and non- business institutions differ. In respect to every
other task, they are similar. But only busi- ness has economic
performance as its specific mission. It is the definition of a
business</p>
<p>that it exists for the sake of economic performance. In all other
institutions, hospital, church, university, or armed services, economics
is a restraint. In business enterprise eco- nomic performance is the
rationale and purpose.</p>
<p>A whole section of this book (Chapters 11, 12, 13 and 14) is devoted
to the perform- ance of the non-business, the public-service,
institutions. But the emphasis of this book is on business enterprise
and the task of economic performance. While by no means the only task to
be discharged in society, it is a priority task, because all other
social tasks— education, health care, defense, and the advancement of
knowledge—depend on the sur- plus of economic resources, i.e., profits
and other savings, which only successful eco- nomic performance can
produce. The more of these other satisfactions we want, and the more
highly we value them, the more we depend on economic performance of
business enterprise.</p>
<p>Business management must always, in every decision and action, put
economic per- formance first. It can justify its existence and its
authority only by the economic results it produces. A business
management has failed if it fails to produce economic results. It has
failed if it does not supply goods and services desired by the consumer
at a price the con- sumer is willing to pay. It has failed if it does
not improve, or at least maintain, the wealth-producing capacity of the
economic resources entrusted to it. And this, whatever the economic or
political structure or ideology of a society, means responsibility for
prof- itability. (On the functions of profit see Chapter 6.)</p>
<p>The first definition of business management is that it is an economic
organ, the spe- cifically economic organ of an industrial society. Every
act, every decision, every delib- eration of management, has economic
performance as its first dimension.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Productive Work and Worker Achievement</li>
</ol>
<p>The second task of management is to make work productive and the
worker achieving. Business enterprise (or any other institution) has
only one true resource: man. It performs by making human resources
productive. It accomplishes its performance through work. To make work
productive is, therefore, an essential function. But at the same time,
these institutions in today’s society are increasingly the means through
which individual human beings find their livelihood, find their access
to social status, to community and to indi- vidual achievement and
satisfaction. To make the worker achieving is, therefore, more and more
important and is a measure of the performance of an institution. It is
increas- ingly a task of management.</p>
<p>Organizing work according to its own logic is only the first step.
The second and far more difficult one is making work suitable for human
beings—and their logic is radically different from the logic of work.
Making the worker achieving implies consideration of the human being as
an organism having peculiar physiological and psychological proper-
ties, abilities, and limitations, and a distinct mode of action. It
implies consideration of the human resource as human beings and not as
things, and as having—unlike any other re- source—personality,
citizenship, control over whether they work, how much and how well, and
thus requiring responsibility, motivation, participation, satisfaction,
incentives and rewards, leadership status, and function.</p>
<p>Management, and management alone, can satisfy these requirements. For
workers, whether machine tenders or executive vice-presidents, must be
satisfied through their achievement in work and job—that is, within the
enterprise; and management is the acti- vating organ of the
enterprise.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Social Impacts and Social Responsibilities</li>
</ol>
<p>The third task of management is managing the social impacts and the
social responsibili- ties of the enterprise. None of our institutions
exists by itself and is an end in itself. Every one is an organ of
society and exists for the sake of society. Business is no exception.
Free enterprise cannot be justified as being good for business. It can
be justified only as being good for society.</p>
<p>The first new institution to emerge after antiquity, the first
institution of the West, was the Benedictine monastery of the sixth
century. It was not founded to serve community and society, however. On
the contrary, it was founded to serve exclusively its own mem- bers and
to help them toward their own salvation. Therefore, Saint Benedict
removed his monastery from human society and into the wilderness. He was
not particularly afraid that his monks would yield to the temptations of
the world. He saw a greater danger: that they would be concerned with
the world, take responsibility for it, try to do good, and be forced to
take leadership.</p>
<p>Unlike the Benedictine monastery, every one of our institutions today
exists to con- tribute outside of itself, to supply and satisfy
nonmembers. Business exists to supply goods and services to customers,
rather than to supply jobs to workers and managers, or even dividends to
stockholders. The hospital does not exist for the sake of doctors and
nurses, but for the sake of patients whose one and only desire is to
leave the hospital cured and never come back. The school does not exist
for the sake of teachers, but for the students. For a management to
forget this is mismanagement.</p>
<p>No institution can, therefore, exist outside of community and society
as the Benedic- tine monastery, unsuccessfully, tried. Psychologically,
geographically, culturally, and socially, institutions must be part of
the community.</p>
<p>To discharge its job, to produce economic goods and services, the
business enterprise has to have impacts on people, on communities, and
on society. It has to have power and authority over people, e.g.,
employees, whose own ends and purposes are not defined by and within the
enterprise. It has to have impact on the community as a neighbor, as the
source of jobs and tax revenue, but also of waste products and
pollutants. And, increas- ingly, in our pluralist society of
organizations, it has to add to its fundamental concern for the
quantities of life, i.e., economic goods and services, concern for the
quality of life, that is, for the physical, human, and social
environment of modern man and modern community.</p>
<p>This dimension of management is inherent in the work of managers of
all institutions.</p>
<p>University, hospital, and government agency equally have impacts,
equally have respon- sibilities—and by and large have been far less
aware of them, far less concerned with their human, social, and
community responsibilities than business has. Yet, more and more, we
look to business management for leadership with regard to the quality of
life. Managing social impacts is, therefore, becoming a third major task
and a third major di- mension of management.</p>
<p>These three tasks always have to be done at the same time and within
the same managerial action. It cannot even be said that one task
predominates or requires greater skill or com- petence. True, business
performance comes first—it is the aim of the enterprise and the reason
for its existence. But if work and worker are mismanaged there will be
no business performance, no matter how good the chief executive may be
in managing the business. Economic performance achieved by mismanaging
work and workers is illusory and actu- ally destructive of capital even
in the fairly short run. Such performance will raise costs to the point
where the enterprise ceases to be competitive; it will, by creating
class hatred and class warfare, make it impossible in the end for the
enterprise to operate at all. And, mismanaging social impacts eventually
will destroy society’s support for the enterprise and with it the
enterprise as well.</p>
<p>Each of these three tasks has a primacy of its own. Managing a
business has primacy because the enterprise is an economic institution;
but making work productive and work- ers achieving has importance
precisely because society is not an economic institution and looks to
management for the realization of basic beliefs and values. Managing the
enter- prise’s social impacts has importance because no organ can
survive the body which it serves; and the enterprise is an organ of
society and community.</p>
<p>In these areas also, there are neither actions nor results except of
the entire business (or university, or hospital, or government agency).
There are no “functional” results and no “functional” decisions. There
is only business investment and business risk, business</p>
<p>profit and business loss, business action or business inaction,
business decision and busi- ness information. It is not a plant that
pollutes; it is Consolidated Edison of New York, the Union Carbide
Corporation, the paper industry, or the city’s sewers.</p>
<p>Yet, work and effort are always specific. There is tension,
therefore, between two re- alities: that of performance and that of
work. To resolve this tension, or at least to make it productive, is the
constant managerial task.</p>
<p>The Time Dimension</p>
<p>One complexity is ever-present in every management problem, every
decision, every ac- tion—not, properly speaking, a fourth task of
management, and yet an additional dimen- sion: time.</p>
<p>Management always has to consider both the present and the future;
both the short run and the long run. A management problem is not solved
if immediate profits are purchased by endangering the long-range health,
perhaps even the survival, of the company. A man- agement decision is
irresponsible if it risks disaster this year for the sake of a grandiose
future. The all too common case of the great man in management who
produces startling economic results as long as he runs the company but
leaves behind nothing but a sinking hulk is an example of irresponsible
managerial action and of failure to balance present and future. The
immediate economic results are actually fictitious and are achieved by
paying out capital. In every case where present and future are not both
satisfied, where their requirements are not harmonized or at least
balanced, capital, that is, wealth- producing resource, is endangered,
damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>Today we are particularly conscious of the time dimension in respect
to the long-range impact of short-run economic decisions on the
environment and on natural resources. But the same problem of
harmonizing today and tomorrow exists in all areas, and especially with
respect to people.</p>
<p>The time dimension is inherent in management because management is
concerned with decisions for action. And action always aims at results
in the future. Anybody whose responsibility it is to act—rather than to
think or to know—commits himself to the future.</p>
<p>There are two reasons why the time dimension is of particular
importance in manage- ment’s job, and of particular difficulty. In the
first place, it is the essence of economic and technological progress
that the time span for the fruition and proving out of a decision is
steadily lengthening. Edison, in the 1880s, needed two years or so
between the start of laboratory work on an idea and the start of
pilot-plant operations. Today it may well take Edison’s successors
fifteen years. A half century ago a new plant was expected to pay for
itself in two or three years; today, with capital investment per worker
twenty times that of 1900, the payoff period often runs to ten or twelve
years. A human organization, such as a sales force or a management
group, may take even longer to build and to pay for itself.</p>
<p>The second peculiar characteristic of the time dimension is that
management—almost alone—has to live always in both present and
future.</p>
<p>A military leader, too, knows both times. But traditionally he rarely
had to live in both at the same time. During peace he knew no “present”;
the present was only a preparation for the future war. During war he
knew only the most short-lived “future”; he was con- cerned with winning
the war at hand. Everything else he left to the politicians. That this
is no longer true in an era of cold wars, near wars, and police actions
may be the single most important reason for the crisis of military
leadership and morale that afflicts armed ser- vices today. Neither
preparation for the future nor winning the war at hand will do any
longer; and as a result, the military man has lost his bearings.</p>
<p>But management always must do both. It must keep the enterprise
performing in the present—or else there will be no enterprise capable of
performing in the future. And it has to make the enterprise capable of
performance, growth, and change in the future. Other- wise it has
destroyed capital—that is, the capacity of resources to produce wealth
tomor- row.</p>
<p>The only thing we know about the future is that it is going to be
different. There may be great laws of history, great currents of
continuity operating ever whole epochs. But within time spans of
conscious decision and action—time spans of years rather than cen-
turies—in which the managers of any institution operate, the uncertainty
of the future is what matters. The long-run continuity is not relevant;
and anyhow, it can be discerned only in retrospect and only in
contemplation of history, of how it came out.</p>
<p>For the manager the future is discontinuity. And yet the future,
however different, can be reached only from the present. The greater the
leap into the unknown, the stronger the foundation for the takeoff has
to be. The time dimension endows the managerial decision with its
special characteristics. It is the act in which the manager integrates
present and future.</p>
<p>Administration and Entrepreneurship</p>
<p>There is another dimension to managerial performance. The manager
always has to ad- minister. He has to manage and improve what already
exists and is already known. But he also has to be an entrepreneur. He
has to redirect resources from areas of low or dimin- ishing results to
areas of high or increasing results. He has to slough off yesterday and
to render obsolete what already exists and is already known. He has to
create tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the ongoing business markets, technologies, products, and services
exist. Facilities and equipment are in place. Capital has been invested
and has to be serviced. People are employed and are in specific jobs,
and so on. The administrative job of the manager is to optimize the
yield from these resources.</p>
<p>This, we are usually told, especially by economists, means
efficiency, that is, doing better what is already being done. It means
focus on costs. But the optimizing approach should focus on
effectiveness. It focuses on opportunities to produce revenue, to create
markets, and to change the economic characteristics of existing products
and markets. It asks not, How do we do this or that better? It asks,
which of the products really produce extraordinary economic results or
are capable of producing them? Which of the markets and/or end uses are
capable of producing extraordinary results? It then asks, To what re-
sults should, therefore, the resources and efforts of the business be
allocated so as to pro- duce extraordinary results rather than the
“ordinary” ones which is all efficiency can pos- sibly produce?</p>
<p>This does not deprecate efficiency. Even the healthiest business, the
business with the greatest effectiveness, can well die of poor
efficiency. But even the most efficient busi- ness cannot survive, let
alone succeed, if it is doing the wrong things, that is, if it lacks
effectiveness. No amount of efficiency would have enabled the
manufacturer of buggy whips to survive.</p>
<p>Effectiveness is the foundation of success—efficiency is a minimum
condition for survival after success has been achieved. Efficiency is
concerned with doing things right. Effectiveness is doing the right
things.</p>
<p>Efficiency concerns itself with the input of effort into all areas of
activity. Effective- ness, however, starts out with the realization that
in business, as in any other social organ- ism, 10 or 15 percent of the
phenomena—such as products, orders, customers, markets, or
people—produce 80 to 90 percent of the results. The other 85 to 90
percent of the phe- nomena, no matter how efficiently taken care of,
produce nothing but costs (which are always proportionate to
transactions, that is, to busy-ness).</p>
<p>The first administrative job of the manager is, therefore, to make
effective the very small core of worthwhile activities which is capable
of being effective. At the same time, he neutralizes (if he does not
abandon) the very large penumbra of transactions: products or staff
activities, research work or sales efforts, which, no matter how well
done, will not yield extraordinary high results (whether they represent
the realized opportunities of the past, mere busy-ness, or unfulfilled
hopes and expectations of the past, that is, the mis- takes of
yesterday).</p>
<p>The second administrative task is to bring the business all the time
a little closer to the full realization of its potential. Even the most
successful business works at a low coeffi- cient of performance as
measured against its potential—the economic results that could be
obtained were efforts and resources marshaled to produce the maximum
yield they are inherently capable of.</p>
<p>This task is not innovation; it actually takes the business as it is
today and asks, What is its theoretical optimum? What inhibits
attainment thereof? Where (in other words) are the limiting and
restraining factors that hold back the business and deprive it of the
full return on its resources and efforts?</p>
<p>One basic approach—offered here by way of illustration only—is to ask
the question What relatively minor changes in product, technology,
process, market, and so on, would significantly improve or alter the
economic characteristics and results of this business? (This is similar
to the vulnerability analysis of the modern systems engineers.)</p>
<p>In making steel these vulnerabilities—the factors that hold the
economic results of the steel industry way below the theoretical
potential of industry and process—might, for instance, be the need, in
present steel technology, to create high heats three times, only to
quench them three times. For the most expensive thing to produce are
temperatures, whether heat or cold. In the electrical apparatus business
one vulnerability might well be the habit of public-utility customers to
have each generating turbine designed as if it were a unique product
rather than assembled as one of a large number and according to stan-
dard performance specifications. Another vulnerability might be the
habit of the public- utility customers to order turbines when
money-market rates are low, which then creates expensive fluctuations in
demand and production schedules. If these two habits could be changed,
large generating turbines might well come down 44 to 50 percent in cost.
In life insurance, to give one more example, a central vulnerability
might be the high cost of the individual sale. A way to overcome this
vulnerability and to realize the potential of the business somewhat more
fully might be either statistical selling—elimination of the ex- pensive
personal selling efforts—or enrichment of the sales channel, for
instance, by sell- ing financial planning (including all other
investment instruments, such as investment trust certificates), rather
than only life insurance.</p>
<p>These examples are cited to show that a relatively minor change does
not necessarily have to be easy to make. In fact, we may not know how to
do it. But it is still minor, for the business would remain essentially
as it is now, yet would have different economic results. And while the
illustrations show clearly that these changes may require innova- tion,
they are not, in themselves, innovations. They are primarily
modifications of the existing business.</p>
<p>At the same time, inherent in the managerial task is
entrepreneurship: making the business of tomorrow. Inherent in the task
is innovation.</p>
<p>Making the business of tomorrow starts out with the conviction that
the business of tomorrow will be and must be different. But it also
starts out of necessity—with the busi- ness of today. Making the
business of tomorrow cannot be a flash of genius. It requires systematic
analysis and hard, rigorous work today—and that means by people in
today’s business and operating within it.</p>
<p>The specific job of entrepreneurship in business enterprise is to
make today’s business capable of making the future, of making itself
into a different business. It is the specific job of entrepreneurship in
the going business to enable today’s already existing—and especially
today’s already successful—business to remain existing and to remain
success- ful in the future.</p>
<p>Success cannot, one might say, be continued forever. Businesses are,
after all, crea- tions of man which have no true permanence. Even the
oldest businesses are creations of recent centuries. But a business
enterprise must continue beyond the lifetime of the indi- vidual or of
the generation to be capable of producing its contributions to economy
and to society. The perpetuation of a business is a central
entrepreneurial task—and ability to do so may well be the most trenchant
and definitive test of a management.</p>
<p>The Work of the Manager</p>
<p>Each of these tasks and dimensions has its own skills, its own tools,
its own requirements. But the total management task requires their
integration. And this too requires specific work and its specific tool.
The tool is management; and the work is managing managers.</p>
<p>The tasks—economic performance; making work productive and the worker
achiev- ing; managing social impact and social responsibilities; and
doing all this in a balance between the demands of today and the demands
of tomorrow—are the things in which the public at large has a stake. The
public has no concern with—and only mild interest in— what managers have
to do to accomplish their tasks. It rightly is concerned with perform-
ance. But managers must be concerned with the means to the
accomplishment of their tasks. They must be concerned with managerial
jobs, with the work of the manager, with the skills he needs, and with
his organization.</p>
<p>Any book of management that does not begin with the tasks to be
performed miscon- ceives management. Such a book sees management as
something in itself, rather than as a means to an end. It fails to
understand that management exists only in contemplation of performance.
It treats management as an independent reality, whereas management is an
organ which derives existence, identity, and justification from the
function it serves. The focus must be on the tasks.</p>
<p>To start out discussing management with the work of the manager or
with managerial organization—as most books on management do—is the
approach of the technocrat, who soon degenerates into a bureaucrat. But
it is even poor technocracy. For, as will be stressed again and again in
this book, management work, management jobs, and manage- ment
organization are not absolutes, but are determined and shaped by the
tasks to be performed. “Structure follows strategy” is one of the
fundamental insights we have ac- quired in the last twenty years.
Without understanding the mission, the objectives, and the strategy of
the enterprise, managers cannot be managed, organizations cannot be de-
signed, managerial jobs cannot be made productive.</p>
