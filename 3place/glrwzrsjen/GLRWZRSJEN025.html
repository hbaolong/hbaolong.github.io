Decentralization—The De- mands of Management—The Leadership of
People—The Traditional Approaches— Welfare Paternalism—The Krupp
Example—Personnel Management—People as a Cost and as a Threat— “Our
Greatest Resource Is People”—The Practices of People Management—Treating
People as a Resource—Placement</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>VERYTHING DISCUSSED in the preceding chapter for years. Everything
has actually been practiced in a</p>
<p>of this section has been known good many companies, if only</p>
<p>in bits and pieces rather than systematically. Wherever tried, these
approaches have worked and have made for stronger and more prosperous
institutions, and for stronger management.</p>
<p>Managements everywhere have nodded with approval when learning or
reading about these approaches. Yet few managements have acted. Only now
when major shifts in work, work group, and working threaten to make
ineffectual both carrot and stick are manage- ments willing to pay more
than lip service.</p>
<p>What explains this resistance, this unwillingness to learn from such
eminently respect- able and successful examples as, for instance, Zeiss
and IBM?</p>
<p>The first, and in many ways the main, reason for the reluctance of
managers to face up to the problem of making the worker achieving is a
confusion of power with authority in managerial minds. Managers resist
as abdication of authority the demand for worker re- sponsibility,
whether on the part of the manual worker on the shop floor or of the
knowl- edge professional. They see their authority undermined by “giving
up power.”</p>
<p>Japanese managements can hardly be accused of having abdicated. They
have more authority than managements in the West. Not can IBM be accused
of having abdicated. Indeed, the main criticism of IBM by “liberals” for
many years has been that IBM is in effect a tyranny. And Zeiss was
anything but permissive and operated under strict disci- pline.</p>
<p>Power and authority are two different things. Management has no
power. Management has only responsibility. And it needs and must have
the authority to discharge its respon- sibilities—but not one whit
more.</p>
<p>American managements still sometimes invoke “management
prerogatives,” espe- cially to resist union demands. This is a
singularly unfortunate phrase. A prerogative is a privilege of rank.
Management has no claim to any such privilege. It exists to discharge a
function. Its job is to make productive the resources in its trust. A
prerogative is never based on responsibility or contribution—originally
the word was used to denote “divine right.” And even the most autocratic
management is unlikely to claim divine right. Man- agement has authority
only as long as it performs.</p>
<p>To invoke management prerogatives undermines managerial authority.
Managements who refuse to demand responsibility from the members of the
organization are actually losing necessary authority, especially to the
labor union and to government.</p>
<p>Managers of business are by no means alone in their confusion of
power with author- ity. Indeed, managers of business, by and large, have
been more willing to work on build- ing an achieving work force than
managers of public-service institutions. The government agency and the
hospital have been even more reluctant to make their workers
responsible, have even more depended on prerogatives rather than on the
authority appropriate to their responsibilities. As a result, they have
actually lost true and needed authority, are even more hedged in by
restraints and restrictions, and have even greater difficulty mobilizing
the human resources of their organizations.</p>
<p>The Lesson of Decentralization</p>
<p>This is not the first time that managements have suffered from this
confusion of authority with power, to their detriment and that of their
organizations. A similar confusion was common a few decades ago, with
respect to organization structure.</p>
<p>There was considerable resistance to decentralization in the forties
and fifties. It was widely feared that it would weaken top management
and would indeed lead to “top man- agement abdication.”</p>
<p>By now managers everywhere have learned that decentralization
strengthens top man- agement. It makes it more effective and more
capable of doing its own tasks. It results in greater authority for top
management (on this see Chapter 46).</p>
<p>Similarly, the Japanese managers, IBM, or, much earlier even, Zeiss,
learned that to make the worker achieving strengthens management’s
authority. It makes management more effective by enabling it to focus on
the tasks which management needs to perform and to relieve itself of
those tasks which management need not perform, does poorly, and spends
far too much time on if loaded down with them.*</p>
<p>Responsible worker, responsible work group, and self-governing work
community are decentralization. What is being decentralized is not
business management, it is work man-</p>
<p>agement. But the principle is similar. And just as decentralization
was the main thrust in the years of the management boom, so the
responsible worker should be central to the years of management
performance ahead.</p>
<p>Responsibility built into the work force from top to bottom is
needed, above all, to re- verse the erosion of management authority
which is a threat to the functioning of man- agement and of our
institutions altogether. Carrot and stick no longer suffice. But nothing
has truly taken their place. As a result there is an authority vacuum.
It is most noticeable among the knowledge workers in business, in the
government agency, and in the other service institutions. Its symptom is
cynicism—a more dangerous disease than rebellion against authority. The
only way to counteract it and to restore management’s authority is to
demand responsibility of each member of the work force.</p>
<p>The Demands on Management</p>
<p>There was a second reason why top managements twenty years ago
resisted decentraliza- tion. They feared the high demands it makes on
top management. And a similar fear also explains the resistance of
managers to worker and work-community responsibility.</p>
<p>A responsible work force does indeed make very high demands on
managers. It de- mands that they be truly competent—and competent as
managers rather than as psycholo- gists or psychotherapists. It demands
that they take their own work seriously. It demands that they themselves
take responsibility for their jobs and their performances.</p>
<p>Responsibility is harsh taskmaster. To demand it of others without
demanding it of oneself is futile and irresponsible. The worker cannot
assume the burden of responsibility for his own job, work group, and
work-community affairs unless he can be confident of the seriousness,
responsibility, and competence of his company. He must be able to have
confidence that the boss knows his own job and work. He must take it for
granted that the</p>
<p>*This is brought out clearly in the book of Shigeru Kobayashi of Sony
Corp., Creative Management (American Management Association, 1971).</p>
<p>boss provides the tools the worker himself needs to be able to do
productive work and the information the worker needs to direct and
control himself.</p>
<p>Nothing quenches motivation as quickly as a slovenly boss. People
expect and de- mand that managers enable them to do a good job and work
productively and intelli- gently. People have indeed a right to expect a
serious and competent superior.</p>
<p>In Japanese companies industrial engineers, as has been said before,
do not complain about workers resistance. Rather they tend to complain
that workers demand too much of them. The Japanese work force, which
holds itself responsible for production, rightly ex- pects the people on
whom it depends for its “tools,” that is, for the understanding of work
and process, to perform to exacting standards.</p>
<p>People do not expect perfection. They know that the boss is also a
human being. But people who take responsibility for their own work
demand that managers do what they are being paid for: that they plan;
that they set objectives and think through priorities; that they think
through assignments and set standards. Above all, they expect that the
manager take responsibility for his own work and performance.</p>
<p>Napoleon has been called many things, but “likable” is not one of
them. The “great leader” is rarely “warm”; a good many have been icy. He
is not often “outgoing” or “affa- ble”; he tends to be austere and
aloof. He has little “empathy”; he makes demands. A good many have had
not a trace of charisma. But a leader always inspires confidence, always
commands respect.</p>
<p>It has been said, and only half in jest, that a tough, professionally
led union is a great force for improving management performance. It
forces the manager to think through what he is doing and to be able to
explain his actions and behavior.</p>
<p>A responsible work force is an even more stringent discipline. It
brings into the open the positive dissatisfactions within the group, all
the desires to do a better job, all the im- patience with bumbling,
laziness, petty restraints, and lame excuses. But unlike a union, an
achieving work force is does not exert its pressure as an adversary. It
exerts it in coop- eration. It “plays on the same team.” But for this
reason it expects team captains and team leaders, that is, managers, to
hold themselves to high standards and to take their own jobs
seriously.</p>
<p>The Leadership of People</p>
<p>Finally, to make the worker “achieve” demands that managers look upon
labor as a re- source rather than as a problem, a cost, or an enemy to
be cowed It demands that manag- ers accept responsibility for making
human strengths effective. And this means a drastic shift from personnel
management to the leadership of people.</p>
<p>There are three traditional approaches to managing people. There is
the welfare ap- proach, which sees people as problems which need help.
There is the personnel manage- ment approach, which sees activities and
chores to be performed whenever large numbers of people have to work
together. Third is the approach which sees labor as a cost and as a
threat and sees the job in controlling cost and in fighting
“crises.”</p>
<p>People are indeed “problems.” And people do need help. The welfare
approach can be highly effective, especially in managing people who
truly are helpless.</p>
<p>The best example, at least in the West, is the House of Krupp. Alfred
Krupp, who built the firm in the middle of the nineteenth century, was
not a brilliant engineer. Nor did Krupp’s rise rest on major innovations
in product or process. It rested squarely on the tremendous support
Alfred Krupp built into his work force. Having grown up in extremes of
poverty and near-destitution, he, perhaps alone of the major business
builders of the mid-nineteenth-century Europe, had compassion for the
large masses of unskilled, unlet- tered, helpless peasants who were
being driven out of their wretched tenant farms in East Prussia by the
new “scientific agriculture” of the Junkers and who fled helter-skelter
into the newly industrializing Ruhr. Long before his firm became
profitable and prosperous, he provided housing, schooling, health care,
training, small loans at low interest, and so on. Indeed, Krupp at Essen
might be called the first welfare state.</p>
<p>It was a state ruled by an autocrat. Yet the “Kruppianers,” the
descendants of Alfred Krupp’s original workers, never forgot the
compassion of the original founder. They gave their loyalty to firm and
family even though Alfred Krupp was succeeded by three genera- tions of
incompetents. It was largely their dedication to the memory of Alfred
Krupp which enabled the firm to come back twice—after World War I and
after the almost total destruction of World War II.</p>
<p>But the Krupp example also shows the danger of welfare paternalism.
It eventually destroys itself. For it creates expectations which, in the
long run, no business enterprise—</p>
<p>and no institution—can live up to.</p>
<p>Krupp’s paternalism was a major reason, and perhaps the reason for
the ultimate col- lapse of the Krupp family. Krupp’s overexpansion after
World War II was in large meas- ure motivated by the need to live up to
the Krupp promise that every Kruppianer would forever have a job. This
in turn meant that the very parts of the Krupp concern that had the
least potential for growth in the post-World War II economy, e.g., coal
mines and steel mills located far inland, had to be expanded the most.
This ultimately brought the company to the verge of collapse. The family
was ousted from management and, in effect, expropriated by the banks as
their price of rescuing the business. Large numbers of old, loyal
Kruppianers had to be laid off in the middle of a serious recession in
the German coal and steel industry when no other jobs were
available.</p>
<p>Even more serious is the aftermath of a welfare paternalism which the
“children” ulti- mately outgrow and reject. It leaves behind a legacy of
bitterness and of mutual contempt that goes beyond anything the most
bitter industrial warfare could have produced.</p>
<p>Two of the nastiest and most bruising of recent labor conflicts were
rebellions against a paternalism that had outlived itself. One was the
strike at the Pilkington Brothers Glass Company at St. Helen’s, England,
in 1971—after almost a century of successful paternal- ism. Twenty years
earlier the employer with the greatest welfare concern for employees in
the United States—the Hershey Chocolate Company in Hershey,
Pennsylvania—had similarly come to the end of the paternalist road in a
strike that was made all the more bitter by the fact that the company is
not owned by “capitalists” but by a foundation for the benefit of the
employees.</p>
<p>The more successful welfare paternalism is—and the more needed—the
more should management prepare for its self-liquidation. And the way to
do this is of course, to de- velop the fullest possible responsibility
for job, work group, and work-community affairs or worker and work
force.</p>
<p>The Marks andandandand Spenser staff manageress (see Chapter 8) was a
welfare worker in the 1920s, when there was need for a highly
paternalist approach. The shopgirl who sold in the Marks andandandand
Spencer store in those days came straight out of the worst slums of the
old industrial cities. She was, as a rule, ignorant, illiterate,
helpless, frightened, if not indeed, brutalized. But as the work force
changed with the changes in British society the staff manageress ceased
to be a welfare worker and became teacher, coach, and a kind of om-
budswoman. Her primary job is no longer welfare. It is to be the
conscience of the com- pany in its management of people. She serves,
above all, as a communications channel from the employees to
management.</p>
<p>For knowledge workers welfare paternalism is altogether
inappropriate. But it also makes less and less sense for manual workers
who are well paid, have middle-class stan-</p>
<p>dards of living, and have substantial education.</p>
<p>This probably applies even to Japan with her strong tradition of
group belonging and of group responsibility for the individual. And
indeed, while Japanese companies are maintaining the traditional welfare
paternalism for their young women workers recruited largely from rural
areas, and for manual workers in general, a good many of them are
shifting slowly but steadily away from the traditional “family” concept
for their knowl- edge workers—and for good reasons. Japanese business,
now, when the need for paternal- ism is rapidly disappearing, might well
turn over the welfare functions to the work com- munity. Otherwise Japan
may soon face a crisis of welfare paternalism, as damaging to</p>
<p>the economy as Krupp’s overcommitment, and as destructive to
industrial cohesion as the Pilkington and Hershey strikes.</p>
<p>Even at its most successful, the welfare approach is not an approach
for managing people. It is an approach for helping people. It assumes
that people are defined by their weakness. It does not try to find and
make productive their strengths. It is a complement to the managing of
people rather than its substance.</p>
<p>The welfare approach is a temporary expedient. It is a crutch. As
such it may be very effective, may indeed be crucial to survival. But if
taken for permanent and seen as the final answer, it will eventually
cripple management and workers, company, economy, and society.</p>
<p>Personnel Management</p>
<p>The second approach to the management of people is personnel
management. It arose during and after World War I as an organized and
systematic management function.*</p>
<p>Personnel management is methodical and systematic discharge of all
the activities that have to be done where people are employed,
especially in large numbers: their selection and employment; training;
medical services, the cafeteria, and safety; the administration of
wages, salaries, and benefits, and many others.</p>
<p>Personnel management has to be done. Otherwise there is serious
malfunction. But personnel management activities bear the same
relationship to managing people as vac- uuming the living room and
washing the dishes bear to a happy marriage and the bringing up of
children. If too many dirty dishes pile up in the sink, the marriage may
come apart. But spotless dishes do not by themselves contribute a great
deal to wedded bliss or to close and happy relationships with one’s
children. These are hygiene factors. If neglected, they cause trouble.
They should be taken for granted.</p>
<p>Personnel management concerns itself largely with matters of great
concern to the work community. They should not be considered management
functions. They should be work-community functions and organized as
such. To regard personnel management as managing people at work, as has
been the tendency, is nonmanagement. It is substituting procedures for
policies and forms for substance.†</p>
<p>Personnel management departments have grown at an astronomical rate
since World War II in all countries and in all industries. They have
grown even faster in the public- service sector. Yet personnel managers
everywhere complain that they are “not listened to,” “not supported,”
“have not been truly accepted” by their management colleagues. There is
substance to these complaints. But in the main they reflect a feeling on
the part of the personnel people that there is something wrong with what
they are doing and that they are not addressing themselves to what they
profess to deal with, namely the management of people.</p>
<p>There is need in any organization for a “conscience” with regard to
people (see Chap- ter 42); and conscience functions are top-management
work. But personnel management cannot discharge the conscience job; it
is too busy with activities. Its usual work is “sup- port” (again see
Chapter 42). But it is primarily support to the work community—and this
is where it should be lodged.</p>
<p>Last among traditional approaches to managing people is to see in
them a cost and a threat.</p>
<p>There is need for the control of labor costs. There is need for the
control of labor pro- ductivity. There is need for “fire fighting.”
There is need for the organized guerrilla war- fare of union
relations—or at least we have let this need develop. To take care of
these things is necessary and may, at times, be crucial. But it is not
managing people. It is deal- ing with problems that result from the
failure to manage people. In anything as complex</p>
<p>*The pioneer was an American, Thomas Spates, who, after World War I,
worked first in the International Labor Office and then for many years
as personnel vice-president for a major American corporation, General
Foods. †On this see the chapter “Is Personnel Management Bankrupt?” in
my book, The Practice of Management.</p>
<p>as a modern organization, there will be such failures. But preventing
them, or even curing them, does not make the system work and
produce.</p>
<p>Managing means making the strengths of people effective. Neither the
welfare ap- proach, nor the personnel management approach, nor the
control and fire-fighting ap-</p>
<p>“People Are Our Greatest Asset”</p>
<p>Managers are fond of saying, “Our greatest asset is people.” They are
fond of repeating the truism that the only real difference between one
organization and another is the per- formance of people. All other
resources one organization commands to exactly the same extent as does
any other. And most managers know perfectly well that of all the
resources, people are the least utilized and that little of the human
potential of any organization is tapped and put to work.</p>
<p>But while managers proclaim that people are their major resource, the
traditional ap- proaches to the managing of people do not focus on
people as a resource, but as prob- lems, procedures, and costs.</p>
<p>Realization of this underlies recent proposals to put people into a
company’s financial accounts as “assets.” One such proposal—made by
Michael Schiff; a distinguished ac- counting scholar at New York
University—is to show sales and marketing forces as “in- vestment,” as
they indeed are.</p>
<p>It is perfectly true that the accounting treatment of people shows
them as “costs.” And human beings are always directed by the information
and measurements they receive, even if they know them to be one-sided,
biased, or deficient (on this see Chapter 39, “Controls, Control, and
Management”). An accounting system which would show people as “capital
investments” would therefore make a major difference.</p>
<p>But it is not easy to see how one could show people as assets on the
books. An asset is by definition something one can sell and something
that has a value when a company goes into liquidation. But a company
does not own people. And an asset which can give notice and leave is not
an asset in any sense of the word. There are equally serious practical
ob- jections. How does one, for instance, measure the return on
training?</p>
<p>Still, the idea has merit. It clearly would be highly desirable for
managers to be led by their own measurements and their own controls to
acting on their profession that “people are our greatest asset.” We
clearly need some thing more powerful than meetings, semi- nars,
“sensitivity training,” sermons, or proclamations.</p>
<p>Above all, however, we need practices. And they are easier to obtain
than changes in vision or attitude.</p>
<p>First, of course, is the practice of building responsibility and
achievement into job and work force. There need to be objectives for
every job, set by the man who is to attain the objectives, together with
his manager. The work itself has to be made productive so that the
worker ran work at making himself achieving. And the worker needs the
demand, the discipline, and the incentive of responsibility.</p>
<p>Second, the manager must treat the people with whom he works as
resource to him- self. He has to look to them for guidance regarding his
own job. He has to demand of them that they accept it as their
responsibility to enable their manager to do a better and more effective
job himself. The manager needs to build upward responsibility and upward
contribution into the job of each of his subordinates.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to ask each subordinate to think through and
answer a few sim- ple questions: “What do I do as your manager, and what
does your company do that helps you the most in your job?”; “What do I
do as your manager, and what does the company</p>
<p>do, that hinders you the most in your job?”; and “What can you do
that will help me, as your manager, to the best job for the
company?”</p>
<p>These may seem obvious questions. But they are rarely asked. Whenever
they are be- ing asked, the answers turn out to be far from obvious.</p>
<p>In every case I have come across it turned out that things the
manager did in order to help his people perform their jobs did not help
them at all and indeed hampered them. And it turned out that very few,
if any, of his subordinates had even given thought to the question of
what they might have to do to enable their manager to perform
better.</p>
<p>Such questions force both manager and subordinate to focus on common
performance.</p>
<p>They both focus on the purpose of their relationship. And they are
likely to induce in the manager a new perspective on the people who work
for him. He will make himself look to them as his resource, but will
also guide them to looking to him as their resource.</p>
<p>Placement</p>
<p>The final but perhaps the most important element in managing people
is to place them where their strengths can become productive.</p>
<p>Personnel management stresses selection for employment. It is
debatable whether the results justify the tremendous effort and the
elaborate and ingenious methods of tests, interviews, and selection
procedures that have been developed. In particular it is doubtful that
the complex selection procedures for knowledge people really “select”
anyone.</p>
<p>We know how to identify specific physical traits which render an
individual less likely to perform a specific manual activity,
e.g. laying bricks. We know nothing, however, about configurations of
character, personality, and talent such as come into play in knowl- edge
work and especially in work as a manager. Most American large companies
have been building large staffs of college recruiters who try to find
“potential” among college and professional school graduates. Insofar as
it is the job of these people to attract gradu- ates to their employer,
their activity makes sense. But with respect to their ability to “spot”
the “comers,” their record is dismal. Otherwise, three out of every five
of their “recruits” would not quit their first employer within the first
two or three years. Random selection, e.g., of every third one who
applies, is likely to produce better results. The rea- son is not lack
of skill of the college recruiter. The reason is that we do not know
what we look for in management potential, and have no way of testing it
except in performance.</p>
<p>And neither the elaborate, ritualistic game of the English house
party nor the grueling but purely formalistic entrance tests of the
large Japanese companies make more sense. Their only refinement over the
American practice is greater mental cruelty.</p>
<p>Placement, however, is left largely to chance. Yet no two people have
the same con- figuration of strengths and weaknesses. And no one has
only strengths; there are no “uni- versal geniuses.”* It is the
manager’s job to optimize resources. And placement is the way to
optimize the most expensive resource of them all: the human being.</p>
<p>The Japanese precisely because they cannot fire a man and are stuck
with him, often do a better job in placement than managers in the West.
Indeed (as said in Chapter 20), placing the young knowledge professional
and manager is one of the tasks the “godfather” is expected to discharge
systematically albeit behind the scenes.</p>
<p>In the West, we should be able, however, to do a much better job of
placement than the Japanese do. For the Western manager can take
responsibility for placing people both inside and outside his
organization. The “non-performer” should not be permitted to stay in the
organization—excepting only the “conscience cases” of old, deserving,
employees who have given long years of performance and have earned an
organization’s loyalty. For the non-performer damages the entire
organization. He imposes a load on his fellow em- ployees, who have to
“carry” him. He undermines morale, the organization’s standards, and its
self-respect.</p>
<p>*On placement see also the chapter “Making Strength Effective” in my
book, The Effective Executive.</p>
<p>However, the non-performer is often—and perhaps in most cases—not a
“dud.” He is only in the wrong place—the proverbial square peg in the
round hole. He belongs else- where, where what he can do is needed and
contributes. It is the manager’s job, especially with the young
knowledge worker, to think through where a non-performer might be pro-
ductive and effective, and to say to him, “You are in the wrong
business—you belong</p>
<p>Such practices will not satisfy the many critics of traditional
people management who call for new convictions and for a fundamental
change in attitudes. To be sure, treating people as a resource to the
manager and emphasis on placement where their strengths can be effective
are only “practices.” But they are a good deal more than rhetoric and
pious platitude. They are hard, demanding work. They will not create
utopia-in-organization. But they will point organizations toward
performance rather than conformance. These practices will not make dull
jobs and dull people interesting. But they will go a long way toward
preventing interesting jobs and interesting people from being dulled.
They will not eliminate the basic functions and tensions of organization
and make its problems of economies and power go away. But they might
release countervailing forces of trust and achievement. These practices
will not make unnecessary the traditional approaches to people as
problems, as chores, as cost, and as threat.</p>
<p>But, though only the first steps, they move manager and management
beyond person- nel management and toward the leadership of people.</p>
