<h4 id="the-new-challenges">3 The New Challenges</h4>
<p>The Management Boom and Its Conceptual Foundations—The Need for New
Knowl- edge in the Foundation Areas—The Productivity Need—Beyond
Decentralization— The Need for a New Model—From Personnel Management to
the Leadership of Peo- ple—The New Demands—The Entrepreneurial
Manager—Multi-Institutional Man- agement—Knowledge and Knowledge
Worker—Multinational and Multicultural Management—Management and the
Quality of Life—Management’s New Role</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>here were seven conceptual foundations to the management boom: (1)
agement of work as the key to productivity; (2) decentralization as
a</p>
<p>scientific man- basic principle</p>
<p>of organization; (3) personnel management as the orderly way of
fitting people into organization structures (which included such things
as job descriptions, appraisals, wage and salary administration, but
also “Human Relations”); (4) manager development to pro- vide today for
the management needs of tomorrow; (5) managerial accounting, that is,
the use of analysis and information as the foundation for managerial
decision-making; (6) marketing; (7) finally, there was long-range
planning.</p>
<p>Each of the seven was practiced successfully well before the
management boom got going (as discussed in the “Note: The Roots and
History of Management” at the conclu- sion of the preceding chapter).
The management boom, in other words, refined, added, modified—but
created little. It made accessible to managers everywhere what, up to
then, had been the arcane knowledge of a few experts. It made into
general practice what, till then, had been the rare exception.</p>
<p>The Need for New Knowledge in the Foundation Areas</p>
<p>By the late sixties or early seventies it was becoming clear that the
knowledge on which the management boom was founded no longer sufficed.
Even in most of the foundation areas there emerged needs for new
knowledge, particularly with respect to productivity, organization
design and structure, and the management of people. Scientific
management could no longer deliver increased productivity. In every
country there was a productivity crisis resulting in severe inflationary
pressures.</p>
<p>In retrospect it is becoming apparent that the great productivity
increases of the post- World War II period in Western Europe and Japan
were only partially the result of better management. The main cause was
the movement of very large numbers of people from areas and employments
of low productivity, e.g., marginal subsistence farming in Sicily, in
Spain, and in Japan’s mountainous north, into high-productivity
employment in indus- try. Without such massive migration the
productivity gains of these growth areas would probably have been quite
modest. But these migrations are over. In Western Europe the limit of
absorptive capacity for guest workers has clearly been reached. In Japan
there is not much population left in marginal farming. From now on
productivity gains in these</p>
<p>countries will have to be achieved by making existing workers more
productive in exist- ing jobs.</p>
<p>At the same time the demands on economic performance that can be
satisfied only through higher productivity are escalating. Affluence,
for instance, everybody “knew” (and many still believe) would greatly
reduce the demand for economic performance. Once we knew how to produce
material goods, the demand on the economic function in society would
surely lessen. Instead we are confronted with a rising tide of human
expec- tations. When President Kennedy coined this phrase in the early
sixties, he had in mind the explosive growth of demands for economic
rewards and satisfactions on the part of the poor, the underdeveloped
countries of the world. But affluence has released a similar rising tide
of human expectations among the remaining poor of the developed
countries, whether American Negro or Sicilian peasant. And the affluent
themselves are escalating their demands for economic performance faster
than their own capacity to perform. The educated young people, contrary
to the headlines in the popular press, show little sign of diminished
demand for the traditional economic goods and services (even though
tradi- tional economic theory—the so-called Engel’s Law—would have
predicted such a drop). They show, in addition, an insatiable appetite
for new services and new satisfactions—for education, for health care,
for housing, or for leisure.</p>
<p>Equally new, and perhaps even more costly, is the demand for a clean
environment. It too was a luxury until now. That the masses of
yesterday, in city slum or sharecropper’s shanty, enjoyed clean air,
clean streets, safe water, and wholesome unadulterated food is nostalgic
delusion.</p>
<p>Every one of these new expectations and demands requires massive
economic efforts.</p>
<p>Every one of them absorbs economic resources on a grand scale. Every
one of them pre- supposes, above all, an economic surplus beyond
anything the economy has ever pro- duced before. To satisfy these
demands requires, in other words, a far higher level of pro-
ductivity.</p>
<p>We know what is needed. First the traditional approach focuses on
only one factor of productivity: labor. But productivity is the output
of all three factors of production: land, labor, and capital, in
balance. Even in respect to the productivity of labor, we have taken
only the first step: the analysis of individual pieces of work. We need
to understand the principles of production so as to put work together
into the most productive process. And we need to harmonize the very
different requirements and logics of work and worker.</p>
<p>Beyond Decentralization</p>
<p>Decentralization is the best principle of organization design where
it fits. But the specifi- cations for its application are fairly
stringent. It fits the business for which it was origi- nally designed:
manufacturing, with distinct markets for distinct product lines. It fits
few non-manufacturing businesses perfectly or even adequately. And it
does not fit manufac- turing businesses such as the process industries
(e.g., aluminum or steel), where the same process produces a variety of
products with an infinity of overlapping markets.</p>
<p>Decentralization, we have further learned, is the best principle for
the task of operat- ing an ongoing business. It does not answer the
organizational demands of the innovating task. And it is not enough, by
itself, to organize the top-management task.</p>
<p>As a result of our experience we are looking at new—and so far still
largely experi- mental—design principles: the task force team; simulated
decentralization; the systems organization. They are far from
satisfactory, so far. But their emergence bespeaks a great need for new
models of organization design.</p>
<p>We know that the model which the management boom took to be the
universal one is only a partial model, and in fact no longer the ruling
model. The management boom was, in all areas, based on work done in and
with manufacturing companies, companies that essentially had one product
or one product line, operated within one national market, and which
predominantly employed manual labor. The model, in other words, was
General Motors.</p>
<p>Increasingly the dominant institutions to be managed and organized,
even in the busi- ness field, are not manufacturing companies, not
single-product companies operating in one country or one market alone,
not companies employing primarily manual labor. They are businesses in
the service industries—banking or retail businesses, and non-businesses
such as hospitals and universities. They are multi-product,
multi-technology, multi-market businesses. They are multinational
businesses. And increasingly, the central human re- sources are not
manual workers—skilled or unskilled—but knowledge workers: company
presidents but also computer programmers; engineers, medical
technologists, hospital administrators, salesmen and cost accountants;
teachers, and the entire employed educated middle class which has become
the center of population gravity in every developed coun- try. In other
words, the model of yesterday is becoming less and less pertinent. But
we do not, so far, have a new model.</p>
<p>From Personnel Management to the Leadership of People</p>
<p>Finally, we know that we will have to go beyond personnel management.
We will have to learn to lead people rather than to contain them.</p>
<p>Our traditional approaches fall into three categories. In part they
are philanthropic: the desire to look after the needs, the housing, the
health care, the welfare of people who can- not look after themselves.
In part the traditional approaches are procedural: to handle in an
orderly fashion the recurrent chores connected with the employment of
people. In large measure, finally, the traditional approaches aim at
preventing and curing trouble; they see in people, above all, potential
threats.</p>
<p>The traditional approaches are needed. They are, however, not enough.
Beyond them we will have to learn to look on people as resource and
opportunity rather than as prob- lem, cost, and threat. We will have to
learn to lead rather than to manage, and to direct rather than to
control.</p>
<p>The New Demands</p>
<p>While in important areas the old approaches and the old knowledge
have been outgrown, demands have appeared in entirely new areas which
only a few people at the start of the management boom even divined, let
alone studied. Some of the fundamental assumptions on which the
management boom based itself—the assumptions of all the work on man-
agement during the past century—are being put into doubt by new
developments demand- ing new vision, new work, and new knowledge.</p>
<p>The Entrepreneurial Manager</p>
<p>For three-quarters of a century management has meant primarily
managing the estab- lished, going business. Entrepreneurship and
innovation, while mentioned in many man- agement books, were not seen as
central from 1900 till today. From now on, management will have to
concern itself more and more with creating the new in addition to
optimizing the already existing. Managers will have to become
entrepreneurs, will have to learn to build and manage innovative
organizations.</p>
<p>We face a period of innovation such as the one in which the modern
industrial econ- omy was born in the last half of the nineteenth
century. Then, in the fifty years between the end of America’s Civil War
and the outbreak of World War I, a new major invention made its
appearance on average every fifteen or eighteen months. Each soon
spawned new businesses and entirely new industries. Practically all the
industries that we consider “modern” today, including aircraft and
electronics, grew out of these inventions of the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries. Economic growth right through the period of
reconstruction after World War II was carried primarily by technologies
that had been fully developed by the time World War I broke out, and by
the four large industries built on these technologies: steel, the
automobile, scientific agriculture, and organic chemistry. Now we face
another period of major technological change in which the thrust of
eco-</p>
<p>nomic and industrial development will come from industries based on
new, twentieth- century technologies and their development.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to the late nineteenth century, much of the new
technology will have to be developed and, above all, will have to be
applied in and by already existing busi- nesses. In the late nineteenth
century the archetype was the inventor, a Siemens, a Nobel, an Ericson,
an Alexander Graham Bell, who worked by himself, at most with a few
assis- tants. Even then successful application of an invention very
rapidly led to the emergence of an enterprise. But it was not the
enterprise that had to generate the new. These days increasingly it will
be the existing, often large organization to which we will have to look
for innovation—for the simple reason that both the trained people and
the money needed to develop the new are concentrated in existing and
usually large organizations. Manage- ment will therefore have to learn
to run, at one and the same time, an existing managerial organization
and a new innovative organization.</p>
<p>The need for social innovation may be even greater than for technical
innovation. So- cial innovation has played as large a part in social and
economic change and development as technical innovation. The needs of
our society—the need for rapid social and economic development in the
poor two-thirds of the world; the needs of our big cities; the needs of
the environment; the need for productivity in education and health
care—all these are opportunities for social innovation by business and
business managers. They are opportu- nities for the entrepreneur, and as
such often challenges to, and make demands on, the knowledge, the skill,
the performance of management.</p>
<p>Multi-Institutional Management</p>
<p>The management boom was a boom in business management, and most
management work of the preceding century centered in managing a
business. Now we know, however, that all our institutions need
management.</p>
<p>This would have been heresy only a few years ago (as it still is in
England and France to a good many managers in businesses and service
institutions alike). Running a business and administering a
public-service institution, e.g., a hospital, were then seen as being
poles apart. The mission and purpose of an institution does indeed make
a basic differ- ence. Nothing is less likely to cure the managerial ills
of the public-service institution than the attempt to make its
management “businesslike” (on this see Chapters 11 through 14). But
then, an investment banking firm also requires management that is
different from that of a steel mill or of a department store. And the
manager in public-service institutions faces the same tasks as the
manager in a business: to perform the function for the sake of which the
institution exists; to make work productive and the worker achieving; to
man- age the institution’s social impacts and to discharge its social
responsibilities. These are managerial tasks. Public-service
institutions equally face the challenge of innovation, and have to
manage growth, diversity, and complexity. And we do know, as said
before, that a central management need is to make the non-business, the
service institution, manageable and managed for performance.</p>
<p>Knowledge and Knowledge Worker</p>
<p>A primary task of management in the developed countries in the
decades ahead will be to make knowledge productive. The manual worker is
yesterday—and all we can fight on that front is a rearguard action. The
basic, capital resource, the fundamental investment, but also the cost
center of a developed economy, is the knowledge worker who puts to work
what he has learned in systematic education, that is, concepts, ideas,
and theories, rather than the man who puts to work manual skill or
muscle.</p>
<p>Taylor put knowledge to work to make the manual worker productive.
His industrial engineer was one of the first knowledge workers employed
in the manufacturing process. But Taylor himself never asked the
question What constitutes “productivity” with respect to the industrial
engineer who applies “scientific management”? As a result of Taylor’s
work, we could define what productivity is with respect to the manual
worker; we still</p>
<p>cannot answer what productivity is with respect to the industrial
engineer, or to any other knowledge worker. The measurements which give
us productivity for the manual worker, such as the number of pieces
turned out per hour or per dollar of wage, are irrelevant if applied to
the knowledge worker. There are few things as useless and unproductive
as the engineering department which with great dispatch, industry, and
elegance turns out the drawings for an unsellable product. Productivity
with respect to the knowledge worker is, in other words, primarily
quality.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: making knowledge productive will bring about
changes in job structure, careers, and organizations as drastic as those
which resulted in the factory from the application of scientific
management to manual work. The entrance job—that is, the job that first
introduces the man or woman with high formal education to the adult
world of work and experience—will have to be changed drastically to
enable the knowledge worker to become productive. For it is abundantly
clear that knowledge cannot be produc- tive unless the knowledge worker
finds out who he is himself, what kind of work he is fitted for, and how
he works best. There can be no divorce of planning from doing in
knowledge work. On the contrary, the knowledge worker must he able to
plan himself. Present, entrance jobs, by and large, do not make this
possible. They are based on the assumption—valid to some extent for
manual work but quite inappropriate to knowledge work—that an outside
expert such as the industrial engineer or the work-study specialist can
objectively determine the one best way for any kind of work to be done.
For knowl- edge work, this is simply not true. There may be one best
way, but it is heavily condi- tioned by the individual and not entirely
determined by physical, or even by mental, char- acteristics of the job.
It is temperamental as well.</p>
<p>Multinational and Multicultural Management</p>
<p>There is need for business managements to be multinational.
Economically the world, and especially the developed world, has become
one market. And the underdeveloped, the poor, countries differ from the
developed ones only in their inability to afford what they would like to
have. In terms of its demands, its appetites, and its economic values,
the whole world has become one global shopping center, however divided
it may be politi- cally. The multinational enterprise which optimizes
productive resources, market oppor- tunities, and talents beyond and
across national boundaries is thus a normal, indeed a nec- essary,
response to economic reality.</p>
<p>But all these developments introduce complexity into management well
beyond what earlier generations had to deal with. For management is also
a culture and a system of values and beliefs. It is also the means
through which a given society makes productive its own values and
beliefs. Management may well be considered the bridge between a civili-
zation that is rapidly becoming worldwide and a culture which expresses
divergent tradi- tions, values, beliefs, and heritages. Management must
become the instrument through which cultural diversity can be made to
serve the common purposes of mankind. At the same time, management
increasingly is not being practiced within the confines of one national
culture, law, or sovereignty but multi-nationally. Indeed, management is
becom- ing an institution—so far, almost the only one—of a genuine world
economy.</p>
<p>Management, we now know, has to make productive the values,
aspirations, and tradi- tions of individuals, community, and society for
a common productive purpose. If man- agement does not succeed in putting
to work the specific cultural heritage of a country and of a people,
social and economic development is unlikely to take place. This is, of
course, the great lesson of Japan—and the fact that Japan managed, a
century ago, to put to work her own traditions of community and human
values for the new ends of a modern industrialized state explains why
Japan succeeded while every other non-Western country has so far failed.
Management will have to be considered both a science and a humanity,
both a statement of findings that can be objectively tested and
validated, and a system of belief and experience.</p>
<p>Within the individual country, especially the developed country,
business is rapidly losing its exceptional status as we recognize that
it is the prototype of the typical, univer- sal, social form, the
organized institution requiring management. Beyond the national
boundary, however, business is rapidly acquiring the same exceptional
status it no longer has within the individual developed country. Beyond
the national boundary, business is rapidly becoming the exception, and
the one institution which expresses the reality of a world economy and
of a worldwide knowledge society.</p>
<p>We need to learn how to harmonize in one institution and in one
management both the need for managerial unity across national
boundaries, that is, in a common world econ- omy, and the need for
cultural diversity.</p>
<p>Management and the Quality of Life</p>
<p>Because our society is rapidly becoming a society of organizations,
all institutions, in- cluding business, will have to hold themselves
accountable for the quality of life and will have to make fulfillment of
basic social values, beliefs, and purposes a major objective of their
continuing normal activities rather than a social responsibility that
restrains or that lies outside of their normal main functions.
Institutions will have to learn to make the quality of life compatible
with their main tasks. In the business enterprise, this means that the
attainment of the quality of life will have to be considered an
opportunity to be con- verted by management into profitable
business.</p>
<p>This will apply increasingly to fulfillment of the individual. It is
the organization which is today our most visible social environment. The
family is private rather than communal—not that this makes it any less
important. The community is increasingly in the organization. It will be
the job of management to make the individual’s values and aspirations
redound to organizational energy and performance. It will simply not be
good enough to be satisfied—as industrial relations and even human
relations traditionally have been—with satisfaction, that is, with the
absence of discontent. Perhaps one way to dramatize this is to say that
we may, within another ten years, become far less concerned with manager
development as a means of adapting the individual to the demands of the
organization and far more with management development to adapt the
organization to the needs, aspirations, and potential of the
individual.</p>
<p>We also know that management creates economic and social development.
Economic and social development is the result of management.</p>
<p>Japan a hundred years ago was an underdeveloped country by every
material meas- urement. But it very quickly produced management of great
competence, indeed, of excel- lence. Within twenty-five years Meiji
Japan had become a developed country, and, in- deed, in some aspects,
such as literacy, the most highly developed of all countries. We realize
today that it is Meiji Japan—rather than the traditional models of the
economist: eighteenth-century England or nineteenth-century
Germany—which is the model of de- velopment for the underdeveloped
world.</p>
<p>Wherever we have contributed only the economic factors of production,
especially capital, we have not achieved development. In the few cases
where we have been able to generate management energies we have
generated rapid development. Development, in other words, is a matter of
human energies rather than of economic wealth. And the gen- eration and
direction of human energies is the task of management. Management is the
mover and development is a consequence.</p>
<p>More important even than the new tasks, however, may be management’s
new role.</p>
<p>Management is fast becoming the central resource of the developed
countries and the basic need of the developing ones. From being the
specific concern of business, i.e., the economic institution of society,
management and managers are becoming the distinctive organs of developed
society. What management is and what managers do will, there- fore—and
properly—become increasingly a matter of public concern rather than a
matter for the experts. Management will increasingly be concerned as
much with the expression</p>
<p>of basic beliefs and values as with the accomplishment of measurable
results. It will in- creasingly stand for the quality of life of a
society as much as for its standard of living.</p>
<p>There are many new tools of management the use of which we will have
to learn, and many new techniques. There are a great many new and
difficult tasks. But the most im- portant change for management is that
