Planning: The Entrepreneurial Skill</h4>
<p>The Surge in Long-Range Planning—The Time Spans of Planning—Strategic
Decision-Making Rather Than Long-Range Planning—What Strategic Planning
Is Not— Not a Bag of Tricks—Not Forecasting—The Importance of the Unique
Event—The Futurity of Present Decisions—Planning Is Purposeful
Risk-Taking—What Strategic Planning Is—Sloughing Off Yesterday—What New
Things Do We Have to Do When? —Everything Degenerates into Work—People
Assignments, the Test of Planning— The Need for Measurement and
Feedback</p>
<p>THERE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS UPSURGE in long-range planning these last
twenty years. The very idea was practically unknown a few decades ago.
Now it is the rare large company (at least in the U.S. and in Japan)
that does not have a longrange planning staff and elaborate long-range
plans.</p>
<p>It is true that practically every basic management decision is a
long-range decision— ten years is a rather short time span these days.
Whether concerned with research or with building a new plant, designing
a new marketing organization or a new product, every major management
decision takes years before it is really effective. And it has to be
productive for years thereafter to pay off the investment of men and
money. Managers, therefore, need to be skilled in making decisions with
long futurity on a systematic basis.</p>
<p>Management has no choice but to anticipate the future, to attempt to
mold it, and to balance short-range and long-range goals. It is not
given to mortals to do well any of these things. But lacking divine
guidance, management must make sure that these difficult
responsibilities are not overlooked or neglected but taken care of as
well as is humanly possible.</p>
<p>The future will not just happen if one wishes hard enough. It
requires decision—now.</p>
<p>It imposes risk—now. It requires action—now. It demands allocation of
resources, and above all, of human resources—now. It requires
work—now.</p>
<p>The idea of long-range planning—and much of its reality—rests on a
number of misunderstandings. The present and the immediate short range
require strategic decisions fully as much as the long range. The long
range is largely made by short-run decisions. Unless the long range is
built into, and based on, short-range plans and decisions, the most
elaborate long-range plan will be an exercise in futility. And
conversely, unless the short-range plans, that is, the decisions on the
here and now, are integrated into one unified plan of action, they will
be expedient, guess, and misdirection.</p>
<p>“Short range” and “long range” are not determined by any given time
span. A decision is not short range because it takes only a few months
to carry it out. What matters is the time span over which it is
effective. A decision is not long range because in the early seventies
we resolve on making it in l985; this is not a decision but an idle
diversion. It has as much reality as the eight-year-old boy’s plan to be
a fireman when he grows up.</p>
<p>The idea behind long-range planning is that “What should our business
be?” can and should be worked on and decided by itself, independent of
the thinking on “What is our</p>
<p>business?” and “What will it be?” There is some sense to this. It is
necessary in strategic planning to start separately with all three
questions. What is the business? What will it be? What should it be?
These are, and should be, separate conceptual approaches. With respect
to “What should the business be?” the first assumption must be that it
will be different.</p>
<p>Long-range planning should prevent managers from uncritically
extending present trends into the future, from assuming that today’s
products, services, markets, and technologies will be the products,
services, markets, and technologies of tomorrow, and, above all, from
dedicating their resources and energies to the defense of yesterday.</p>
<p>Planning what is our business, planning what will it be, and planning
what should it be have to be integrated. What is short range and what is
long range is then decided by the time span and futurity of the
decision. Everything that is “planned” becomes immediate work and
commitment.</p>
<p>The skill we need is not long-range planning. It is strategic
decision-making, or perhaps strategic planning.</p>
<p>General Electric calls this work “strategic business planning.” The
ultimate objective of the activity is to identify the new and different
businesses, technologies, and markets which the company should try to
create long range. But the work starts with the question, “What is our
present business?” Indeed, it starts with the questions “Which of our
present businesses should we abandon? Which should we play down? Which
should we push and supply new resources to?”</p>
<p>This may sound like semantic quibbling—and, to a point, it is. But
the confused semantics have led to confused thinking. They have tended
to paralyze strategic decisionmaking rather than to mobilize for it.
They are largely to blame for the failure of many large companies so far
to obtain results from elaborate planning efforts.</p>
<p>What Strategic Planning Is Not</p>
<p>It is important for the manager to know what strategic planning is
not:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is not a box of tricks, a bundle of techniques. It is analytical
thinking and commitment of resources to action.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many techniques may be used in the process—but, then again, none may
be needed.</p>
<p>Strategic planning may require a computer, but the most important
questions, e.g., “What is our business?” or “What should it be?” cannot
be quantified and programmed for the computer. Model building or
simulation may be helpful, but they are not strategic planning; they are
tools for specific purposes and may or may not apply in a given case.
(See Chapter 40, “The Manager and the Management Sciences.”)</p>
<p>Quantification is not planning. To be sure, one uses rigorous logical
methods as far as possible—if only to make sure that one does not
deceive oneself. But some of the most important questions in strategic
planning can be phrased only in terms such as “larger” or “smaller,”
“sooner” or “later.” These terms while quantitative cannot easily be
manipulated by quantitative techniques. And some equally important
areas, e.g., those of political climate, social responsibilities, or
human (including managerial) resources, cannot be quantified at all.
They can be handled only as restraints, or parameters, but not as
factors in the equation itself.</p>
<p>Strategic planning is not the “application of scientific methods to
business decision”</p>
<p>(as one well-known text on planning defines it). It is the
application of thought, analysis, imagination, and judgment. It is
responsibility, rather than technique.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Strategy planning is not forecasting. It is not masterminding the
future. Any attempt to do so is foolish; the future is unpredictable. We
can only discredit what we are doing by attempting it.</li>
</ol>
<p>If anyone still suffers from the delusion that man is able to
forecast beyond a very short time span, let him look at the headlines in
yesterday’s paper, and ask which of them</p>
<p>he could possibly have predicted a decade or so ago. For example,
could he, in 1960, in the waning days of the Eisenhower Administration,
have forecast the almost explosive growth of the Black middle class in
America, which by 1970, had raised two-thirds of Black families above
the poverty line and had given the American Negro family an average
income well above the average family income of affluent Great
Britain?</p>
<p>Could he have forecast ten years ago that the unprecedented economic
advance of the American Negro—the fastest and most massive economic
advance of any class or ethnic group in American history—would only have
made the race problem more acute and riveted our attention on both the
desperate plight of the remaining Negro poor, and on the remaining
discrimination against the achieving Black?</p>
<p>Could he have predicted the chronic American balance-of-payments
deficit of the 1960s and the world financial crisis of 1971? Could he
have predicted that Britain would stay out of the Common Market until
1973? Could he have predicted the Eurodollar market, by means of which
the European investor has financed the expansion of Americanbased
businesses into Europe? Could he have forecast the rise of consumerism?
Could he have forecast the development of multinational
corporations?</p>
<p>We must start out with the premise that forecasting is not a
respectable human activity and not worthwhile beyond the shortest of
periods. Strategic planning is necessary precisely because we cannot
forecast.</p>
<p>Another, even more compelling reason why forecasting is not strategic
planning is that forecasting attempts to find the most probable course
of events or, at best, a range of probabilities. But the entrepreneurial
problem is the unique event that will change the possibilities; the
entrepreneurial universe is not a physical but a social universe.
Indeed, the central entrepreneurial contribution, which alone is
rewarded with a profit, is to bring about the unique event or innovation
that changes the economic, social, or political situation.</p>
<p>This was what Xerox Corporation did in the fifties when it developed
and marketed photocopying machines. This is what the entrepreneurs in
mobile housing did in the 1960s, when the trailer became the new,
permanent, and immobile home and took over practically the entire U.S.
low-cost housing market. The unique event of Rachel Carson’s book Silent
Spring, in the fifties, changed the attitude of a whole civilization
toward the environment. On the social and political scene, this is what
the leaders of the civil rights movement did in the 1960s, and possibly
what the leaders in women’s rights were doing at the start of the
seventies.</p>
<p>Since the entrepreneur upsets the probabilities on which predictions
are based, forecasting does not serve the purposes of planners who seek
to direct their organizations to the future. It certainly is of little
use to planners who would innovate and change the ways in which people
work and live.</p>
<p>Forecasting is therefore not an adequate basis even for purely
adaptive behavior, let alone for the entrepreneurial decisions of
strategic planning.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Strategic planning does nor deal with future decisions. It deals
with the futurity of present decisions. Decisions exist only in the
present. The question that faces the strategic decision-maker is not
what his organization should do tomorrow. It is, “What do we have to do
today to be ready for an uncertain tomorrow?” The question is not what
will happen in the future. It is, “What futurity do we have to build
into our present thinking and doing, what time spans do we have to
consider, and how do we use this information to make a rational decision
now?”</li>
</ol>
<p>Decision-making is a time machine which synchronizes into one present
a great number of divergent time spans. We are only learning this now.
Our approach still tends toward making plans for something we will
decide to do in the future, which may be entertaining but is futile. We
can make decisions only in the present and yet we cannot make decisions
for the present alone; the most expedient, most opportunistic
decision—let alone the decision not to decide at all—may commit us for a
long time, if not permanently and irrevocably.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Strategic planning is not an attempt to eliminate risk. It is not
even an attempt to minimize risk. Such an attempt can lead only to
irrational and unlimited risks and to certain disaster. Economic
activity, by definition, commits present resources to the future, i.e.,
to highly uncertain expectations. To take risks is the essence of
economic activity. One of the most rigorous theorems of economics
(Boehm-Bawerk’s Law) proves that existing means of production will yield
greater economic performance only through greater uncertainty, that is,
through greater risk.</li>
</ol>
<p>While it is futile to try to eliminate risk, and questionable to try
to minimize it, it is essential that the risks taken be the right risks.
The end result of successful strategic planning must be capacity to take
a greater risk, for this is the only way to improve entrepreneurial
performance. To extend this capacity, however, we must understand the
risks we take. We must be able to choose rationally among risk-taking
courses of action rather than plunge into uncertainty on the basis of
hunch, hearsay, or experience, no matter how meticulously
quantified.</p>
<p>What Strategic Planning Is</p>
<p>We can now attempt to define what strategic planning is. It is the
continuous process of making present entrepreneurial (risk-taking)
decisions systematically and with the greatest knowledge of their
futurity; organizing systematically the efforts needed to carry out
these decisions; and measuring the results of these decisions against
the expectations through organized, systematic feedback.</p>
<p>As such planning, whether long range or short range, is nothing new.
It is the organized performance of an old task. But we have learned that
the task will rarely get done unless organized. Above all, it will
rarely become achievement unless done purposefully.</p>
<p>Sloughing Off Yesterday</p>
<p>Planning starts with the objectives of the business. In each area of
objectives, the question needs to be asked, “What do we have to do now
to attain our objectives tomorrow?” The first thing to do to attain
tomorrow is always to be sloughing off yesterday. Most plans concern
themselves only with the new and additional things that have to be
done—new products, new processes, new markets, and so on. But the key to
doing something different tomorrow is getting rid of the
no-longer-productive, the obsolescent, the obsolete..</p>
<p>The first step in planning is to ask of any activity, any product,
any process or market, “If we were not committed to this today, would we
go into it?” If the answer is no, one says, “How can we get
out—fast?”</p>
<p>Systematic sloughing off of yesterday is a plan by itself—and
adequate in many businesses. It will force thinking and action. It will
make available men and money for new things. It will create willingness
to act.</p>
<p>Conversely, the plan that provides only for doing additional and new
things without provision for sloughing off old and tired ones is
unlikely to have results. It will remain plan and never become reality,
yet getting rid of yesterday is the decision that most longrange plans
in business (and even more in government) never tackle—maybe the main
reason for their futility.</p>
<p>What New Things Do We Have to Do—When?</p>
<p>The next step in the planning process is to ask, “What new and
different things do we have to do, and when?”</p>
<p>In every plan there will be areas where all that is needed—or appears
to be needed—is to do more of what we already do. It is prudent,
however, to assume that what we already do is never adequate to the
needs of the future.* But, “What do we need?” is only half the</p>
<p>*On this see the brilliant essay “Businass Planning as Business
Opportunity” by Michael J. Kami, in Preparing Tomorrow’s Business
Leaders Today. Edited by Peter F. Drucker.</p>
<p>question. Equally important is “When do we need it?” for it fixes the
time for beginning work on the new tasks.</p>
<p>There is indeed a “short” range and a “long” range to every decision.
The time between the commitment to a course of action, e.g., to building
a steel mill, and the earliest possible moment for results, i.e.,
getting finished steel, is the short range of a decision. And the
twenty-plus years it takes before, at the earliest, we get back with
compound interest the money invested in the steel mill is the long
range. The long range is the time during which the initial decision must
remain reasonably valid—as to markets, process, technology, plant
location, etc.—to have been the right decision originally.</p>
<p>But it is meaningless to speak of short-range and long-range plans.
There are plans that lead to action today—and they are true plans, true
strategic decisions. And there are plans that talk about action
tomorrow—they are dreams, if not pretexts for non-thinking,
non-planning, non-doing. The essence of planning is to make present
decisions with knowledge of their futurity. It is the futurity that
determines the time span, and not vice versa.</p>
<p>There are limitations on futurity. In business decisions, the most
precise mathematical statement is often that of my eighth-grade teacher:
Parallels are two lines which do not meet this side of the school yard.
In the expectations and anticipations of a business, the old rule of
statistics usually applies that anything beyond twenty years equals
infinity; and since expectations more than twenty years hence have
normally a present value of zero, they should receive only a minimal
allocation of present efforts and resources.</p>
<p>However, results that require a long gestation period will be
obtained only if initiated early enough. Hence, long-range planning
requires knowledge of futurity: “What do we have to do today if we want
to be in some particular place in the future? What will not get done at
all if we do not commit resources to it today?”</p>
<p>To repeat an oft-used illustration: If we know that it takes
ninety-nine years to grow Douglas firs in the Northwest to pulping size,
planting seedlings today is the only way we can provide for pulp supply
in ninety-nine years. Someone may well develop some speeding-up hormone;
but we cannot bank on it if we are in the paper industry. It is quite
conceivable—perhaps highly probable—that we will use wood primarily as a
source of chemicals long before these trees grow to maturity. The paper
supply thirty years hence may depend on less precious, less highly
structured sources of cellulose than a tree, which is the most advanced
chemical factory in the plant kingdom. This simply means, however, that
forests may put their proprietors into the chemical industry sometime
within the next thirty years and they had better learn now something
about chemistry. If, however, paper plants depend on Douglas fir,
planning cannot confine itself to twenty years, but must consider
ninety-nine years.</p>
<p>For other decisions, even five years would be absurdly long. If our
business is buying up distress merchandise and selling it at auction,
next week’s clearance sale is long-range future; anything beyond is
largely irrelevant to us. Thus, the nature of the business and the
nature of the decision determine the time spans of planning.</p>
<p>Time spans are neither static nor “given.” The time decision itself
is a risk-taking decision in the planning process. It largely determines
the allocation of resources and efforts. It largely determines the risks
taken. One cannot repeat too often that to postpone a decision is in
itself a risk-taking and often irrevocable decision. The time decision
largely determines the character and nature of the business.</p>
<p>To sum up: What is crucial in strategic planning is, first, that
systematic and purposeful work on attaining objectives be done; second,
that planning start out with sloughing off yesterday, and that
abandonment be planned as part of the systematic attempt to attain
tomorrow; third, that we look for new and different ways to attain
objectives rather than believe that doing more of the same will suffice;
and finally, that we think through the time dimensions and ask, “When do
we have to start work to get results when we need them?”</p>
<p>Everything Degenerates into Work</p>
<p>The best plan is only a plan, that is, good intentions, unless it
degenerates into work. The distinction that marks a plan capable of
producing results is the commitment of key people to work on specific
tasks. The test of a plan is whether management actually commits
resources to action which will bring results in the future. Unless such
commitment is made, there are only promises and hopes, but no plan.</p>
<p>A plan needs to be tested by asking managers, “Which of your best
people have you put on this work today?” The manager who comes back (as
most of them do) and says, “But I can’t spare my best men now. They have
to finish what they are doing now before I can put them to work on
tomorrow”—this manager simply admits that he does not have a plan. But
he also proves that he needs a plan, for it is precisely the purpose of
a plan to show where scarce resources—and the scarcest is good
people—should be working.</p>
<p>Work implies not only that somebody is supposed to do the job, but
also accountability, a deadline, and finally the measurement of results,
that is, feedback from results on the work and on the planning process
itself.</p>
<p>In strategic planning, measurements present very real problems,
especially conceptual ones. Yet precisely because what we measure and
how we measure determine what will be considered relevant, and determine
thereby not just what we see, but what we—and others—do, measurements
are all-important in the planning process. Above all, unless we build
expectations into the planning decision in such a way that we can
realize early whether they are actually fulfilled or not—including a
fair understanding of what are significant deviations both in time and
in scale—we cannot plan. We have no feedback, no way of self-control
from events back to the planning process.</p>
<p>The manager cannot decide whether he wants to make risk-taking
decisions with long futurity; he makes them by the definition of his
role. All that is within his power is to decide whether he wants to make
them responsibly or irresponsibly, with a rational chance of
effectiveness and success, or as a blind gamble against all odds. And
both because the decision-making process is essentially a rational
process and because the effectiveness of the entrepreneurial decisions
depends on the understanding and voluntary efforts of others, the
approach will be more responsible and more likely to be effective if it
is rational, organized, and based on knowledge, not prophecy. The end
result, however, is not knowledge but strategy. Its aim is action
now.</p>
<p>Strategic planning does not substitute facts for judgment, does not
substitute science for the manager. It does not even lessen the
importance and role of managerial ability, courage, experience,
intuition, or even hunch just as scientific biology and systematic
medicine have not lessened the importance of these qualities in the
individual physician. On the contrary, the systematic organization of
the planning job and the supply of knowledge to it strengthen the
manager’s judgment, leadership, and vision.</p>
<p>Performance in the Service Institution</p>
<p>The public-service institutions—government agency and hospital,
school and university, armed service and professional associations—have
