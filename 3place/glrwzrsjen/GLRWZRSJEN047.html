Design:</h4>
<p>Functional Structure and Team</p>

Structure—Its Strengths and Its Limitations—Can the Weaknesses Be
Offset?—Vail’s “Bogeys”— GE’s “Functional Objectives”—Their Limited
Scope—Where Functionalism Works— The Team—Examples: The Hospital; the

Structure—Team Design and Mass-Production Work—Team Design and Knowledge
Organization</p>
<p>All work, physical as well as mental, can be organized in three
ways.</p>
<p>It can be organized by stages in the process. In building a house we
first build the foundation, then the frame and the roof, and finally the
interior.</p>
<p>It can be organized so that the work moves where the skills and the
tools are for each of the steps required. The traditional metalworking
unique-product plant has batteries of reamers and lathes in one aisle,
stamping machines in another, heat treating equipment in a third, with
the pieces of metal moving from one group of tools and their skilled
opera- tors to another. Or, to give another example, the student at the
university—the “raw mate- rial” of the educational process—moves from
classroom to classroom, from professor to professor, from course to
course. Each professor in each course teaches only the subject of his
specialized skill, with the student emerging at the end as an “educated
man,” or at least as a diploma holder.</p>
<p>Finally, we can join together in a team workers with different skills
and different tools and move them to the work, which itself is
stationary. A movie-making crew—the direc- tor, the actors, the
electricians, the sound engineers— “goes on location.” Each does highly
specialized work; but they work as a team.</p>
<p>“Functional organization” is commonly described as organizing work
into “related bundles of skill.” Actually it uses both the stage
organization and the skill organization of work. Such traditional
functions as manufacturing or marketing comprise a very wide variety of
unrelated skills, viz., the machinist’s skill and the production
planner’s skill in manufacturing, and the salesman’s skill and the
market researcher’s skill in marketing. But manufacturing and marketing
are distinct stages in the process. Other functions, such as accounting
and personnel, are, however, organized by skills. But in any functional
or- ganization the work is moved to the stage or the skill. The work
moves, while the position of the worker is fixed.</p>
<p>In the team structure, however, work and task are, so to speak,
“fixed.” Workers with different skills and different tools are brought
together in a team or a task force and as- signed to a piece of work or
a job whether this is a research project or the architectural design of
a new office building.</p>
<p>Both functional structures and team are very old designs. The
Irrigation Cities of Mesopotamia and the Egyptian pyramid builder
organized work functionally. And the organized and permanent team of the
“hunting band” goes back even further, to the last Ice Age.</p>
<p>But as conscious, deliberate, designed structures, both are new.
Functional organiza- tion was defined and designed by Henri Fayol in the
early years of this century. The team is only now being recognized as a
design principle.</p>
<p>Work and task have to be structured and organized. Any organization
has to apply one or both of the design principles for work and task,
i.e., functional structure and team. Many, as will be discussed later in
this chapter, should apply both. And all organizations need to
understand both.</p>
<p>The Functional Structure</p>
<p>Functional design has the great advantage of clarity. Everybody has a
“home.” Everybody understands his own task. It is an organization of
high stability.</p>
<p>But the price for clarity and stability is that it is difficult for
anyone, up to and includ- ing the top functional people, to understand
the task of the whole and to relate their own work to it. While stable,
the structure is rigid and resists adaptation. It does not prepare
people for tomorrow, does not train and test them, and on the whole,
tends to confirm them in the desire to do a little better what they
already do, rather than to be receptive to new ideas and new ways of
doing things.</p>
<p>The strengths and the limitations of the functional principle give it
peculiar character- istics with respect to the economy specification. At
its best, functional organization works with high economy. Very few
people at the top need to spend much time on keeping the organization
running, that is, on “organizing,” “communications,” “coordination,”
“con- ciliation,” and so on. The rest can do their work. But at its
fairly common worst, func- tional organization is grossly uneconomical.
As soon as it approaches even a modest de- gree of size or complexity,
“friction” builds up. It rapidly becomes an organization of
misunderstandings, feuds, empires and Berlin-Wall building. It soon
requires elaborate, expensive, and clumsy management
crutches—coordinators, committees, meetings, trou- bleshooters, special
dispatchers—which waste everybody’s time without, as a rule, solv- ing
much. And this degenerative tendency prevails not only with respect to
relations be- tween different “functions.” The large functional unit
with its subdivisions and sub- functions is equally prone lo rapid
internal inefficiency and equally requires more and more managerial
effort devoted to its own internal running.</p>
<p>Another way of saying the same thing is that functional design, where
it applies, makes the least psychological demands on the people. They
are highly secure both in their work and in their relationships. When
it, however, is being used beyond fairly narrow limits of size and
complexity it creates emotional tensions, hostilities, and insecurities.
People will then tend to see themselves and their functions belittled,
besieged, attacked. They will come to see it as their first job to
defend their function, to protect it against ma- rauders in other
functions, to make sure “it doesn’t get pushed around.” “Nobody here
realizes that the company is being kept alive by us engineers” (or “us
salesmen” or “us accountants”) is a common complaint. And besting the
“wicked enemies” within will be- come sweeter victory than making the
business prosper. Precisely because functional de- sign demands from
functional people little responsibility for the performance and success
of the whole, a poorly working—or overextended—functional structure is
likely to make people both insecure and parochial.</p>
<p>The basic strength as well as the basic weakness of functional
organization is its ef- fort-focus. Every functional manager considers
his function the most important one. This</p>
<p>results in high emphasis on craftsmanship and professional standards.
But it also makes people in the functional unit prone to subordinate the
welfare of the other functions, if not of the entire business, to the
interests of their unit. There is no real remedy against this tendency
in the functional organization. The lust for aggrandizement on the part
of each function is the price paid for the laudable desire of each
manager to do a good job.</p>
<p>Communications are fairly good in the small functional organization.
They break down once the functional organization reaches even moderate
size. Even within the indi- vidual functional unit, e.g., the marketing
department, communications weaken if the unit becomes large or complex.
People are then increasingly specialists and interested primar- ily in
their own narrow specialty.</p>
<p>The most extreme example is the largest and most highly specialized
functional or- ganization around: the large university. But a large
manufacturing department or the commercial-loan department of a big bank
also resembles that well-known description of a large university faculty
as “a collection of anarchists held together by a common parking
lot.”</p>
<p>As a decision-making structure functional organization—even of fairly
small—works poorly. For decisions cannot, as a rule, be made except at
the highest level of a functional organization. No one except the man at
the top sees the entire business. As a result, deci- sions are also
easily misunderstood by the organization and are poorly implemented.
They are seen as “who is right” rather than as “what is right.” And
because a functional organi- zation has high stability but low
adaptability, the challenge to do something truly new and truly
different is likely to be suppressed rather than brought out in the open
and faced up to.</p>
<p>Functional organization also does poorly in developing, preparing,
and testing men.</p>
<p>Functional organization of necessity puts the major emphasis on a
man’s acquiring the knowledge and competence that pertain to it. Yet the
functional specialist may become narrow in his vision, his skills, and
his loyalties. In a functional organization there is a built-in emphasis
on not showing “unbecoming curiosity” about the work of other func-
tions or specialties, that is, on narrow departmentalization.</p>
<p>Moreover, functional organization tends to make a man unfit for
management— precisely because most of the emphasis is on functional
skill rather than on results and performance. Indeed the more highly
skilled functionally an organizational unit is, the less will it value
management, the less well will it prepare a man to be a manager.</p>
<p>French businesses tend to be most rigidly functional in their
structures. It is therefore perfectly logical that top management in
large French companies does not, as a rule, come out of the business
itself and tends to consider that a career in the company unfits a man
for a top-management position (see Chapter 35). But the fault is not in
the men; it is in using functional organization far beyond the size and
complexity for which it is appropri- ate.</p>
<p>Can the Weaknesses Be Offset?</p>
<p>These limitations and weaknesses of functional organization were
apparent from the very first. A good deal of thought has therefore been
given to attempts to offset them, and to offset in particular the
greatest weakness: the tendency of functional organization to mis-
direct the vision of functional people from contribution and results to
efforts and busy- ness.</p>
<p>The first attempt was made by Theodore Vail of the Bell Telephone
System (see Chapter 13). His “bogeys,” that is, the specific goals and
measurements which were de- veloped for functional work, were derived
from his overall business definition and from the business objectives of
the Telephone Company. While far from perfect and confusing by their
sheer number, they served for many years to direct the efforts of
functional man- agers toward performance and to give functional managers
an immediate “reading” of their contribution to key results.</p>
<p>But it is doubtful that anything like Vail’s system could be designed
for a functional system that is faced with complexity. A telephone
system, after all, has only one product. Until very recently it has had
only one market—and no competition. And while there have been great and
constant technical changes in telecommunications, what the customer
bought did, until recently, not change at all.</p>
<p>Vail’s feedback controls for a functional structure work, in other
words, for a monop- oly, whether private or governmental, with a single
product and one known market. There they are indeed the model—and this
is the situation of a good many, if not of most, non- business service
institutions, e.g., the hospital.</p>
<p>In the typical business, however, these conditions are not present.
And that a similar system of feedback controls for functional work can
be designed for the complex business enterprise seems unlikely; at least
no one has yet been able to do it.</p>
<p>The most comprehensive attempt so far has been made by GE which, for
the last sev- eral decades, has been working on developing performance
objectives for functional work. Yet all that has been accomplished, by
and large, is to work out “standards of good manufacturing work” or
“standards of good accounting work,” that is, standards focused on the
function itself rather than on its contribution to the whole.</p>
<p>Their Limited Scope</p>
<p>Even where functional organization applies, its scope is limited to
operating work. Top management is specific “work” (see Chapter 50), but
it is not “functional” work. And functional organization is the wrong
organization for it. Wherever applied, it has made for a weak top
management.</p>
<p>The large German company after 1900 tended to structure its top
management func- tionally; in many German companies this is still being
done. There was indeed a top- management team, the Vorstand of German
company law. But only one man, the General- Director, was concerned with
top-management work. The other members were the heads of the major
functions and concerned primarily with their areas. As a result, the
General- Director became an autocrat, and the Vorstand team degenerated
into legal fiction. Or there was no top management at all, with each
function going its own way.</p>
<p>The functional principle is even less applicable to innovating work
(see Chapter 61, “The Innovative Organization”). In innovation, we try
to do something we have not done before, that is, something we do not
yet know. We do need the individual skills of the various disciplines in
innovation. But we do not know where and when they will be needed, for
what time, in what degree, or in what volume. The innovative task
therefore cannot be organized on the basis of functional organization.
It is incompatible with it.</p>
<p>Where Functionalism Works</p>
<p>Functionalism works—and exceedingly well—in the kind of business for
which it was designed. The model for Henri Fayol’s functional design
early in this century was the coal-mining company he ran. It was a
fairly large business at that time but would be con- sidered a fairly
small business today. Except for a few engineers it employed only manual
workers who did one kind of work. A coal mine has only one product; only
sizes vary for different customers. Coal requires no treatment beyond
simple washing and sorting. Coal had, at least at that time, only three
markets—steel mills, power plants, and homeowners. And while the
technology of mining coal was changing fairly fast in Fayol’s day—when
he started out, explosives had not yet come into use and when he retired
mechanical coal cutters were already at work—the process itself did not
change at all. And all one can ever get out of a coal mine is coal.
There is not much scope for innovation.</p>
<p>Fayol’s company is the kind of business which the functional design
principle organ- izes well. Anything more complex, more dynamic, or more
entrepreneurial demands per- formance capacities which the functional
principle does not possess. If used beyond the limits of Fayol’s model,
functional structure rapidly becomes costly in terms of time and effort,
and runs a high risk of misdirecting the energies of the organization
away from</p>
<p>The Team</p>
<p>A team is a number of people—usually fairly small—with different
backgrounds, skills, and knowledge, and drawn from various areas of the
organization (their “home”) who work together on a specific and defined
task. There is usually a team leader or team cap- tain. His is often a
permanent appointment for the duration of the team’s assignment. But
leadership at any one time places itself according to the logic of the
work and the specific stage in its progress. There are no superiors and
subordinates; there are only seniors and juniors.</p>
<p>Every business—and every other institution—has been using teams all
along for ad hoc non-recurrent tasks. But we have only recently
recognized what our nomadic Ice Age ancestors knew—the team is also a
principle for permanent, structural design. The mis- sion of the team is
a specific task: the hunting expedition or product development. But the
team itself can be permanent. Its composition may vary from task to
task; its base re- mains, however, fairly constant even though
individual members may scatter between tasks or belong, at one and the
same time, to a number of teams.</p>
<p>Some Examples</p>
<p>Teams have become very popular and are indeed in danger of being
damaged by becom- ing fashionable. Countless books are being written on
“task forces,” “project teams,” “free-form organizations,” “small
groups,” and so on. A few examples will, however, show better than any
theoretical discussion what a team is, how it works, what its re-
quirements are, and what it cannot do.</p>
<p>The hospital may be the simplest example. The structural component in
the hospital is a team mobilized ad hoc from the “services” for the
needs of the individual patient as defined by the team captain, the
physician, with the nurse as the executive officer of the group.</p>
<p>In the hospital everyone directly concerned with patient care, that
is, everyone on the team, is supposed to take personal responsibility
for the success of the whole team’s ef- fort. The doctor’s orders are
law in a hospital. Yet a physical therapist who is told, for instance,
to give rehabilitation exercises to a patient is expected to notice if
the patient seems to run a fever, to stop the exercises, and to notify
the nurse immediately and ask for a temperature reading. He will not
hesitate to countermand a doctor’s orders within his own sphere. The
doctor may order an orthopedic patient to be measured for crutches and
taught how to use them. The physical therapist may take one look and
say, “You don’t need crutches; you’ll be better off using a cane right
away or just walking on your walking cast without any support.”</p>
<p>A business parallel to the example of the hospital is the
organization of a medium- sized European company which designs, makes,
and services plastic molds for several hundred customers, mostly large
companies such as the big automobile plants in the Common Market. In
this company, the work of making the molds is organized on strictly
functional lines. It is highly skilled but self-contained work. But mold
design, selling, and customer service, while shown on the organization
chart as functions, do not work as such. The individual mold designer
works as a member of a team—or of several teams— which is responsible
collectively for an individual customer or a number of customers. The
team leaders may come from any function—selling, service, or mold
design.</p>
<p>Performance responsibility rests with the team. Each team leader
draws on the re- sources of the whole organization as needed. At one
stage he brings in mold designers, at another, salesmen, at another
stage, customer-service people, and so on. Not even sales- men are
assigned permanently to customers; they are assigned to product lines.
But the</p>
<p>team leader who carries primary account responsibility will tend to
work again and again with the same three or four men in each functional
area. Each of them, in turn, considers himself as being “close” to three
or four of the teams—though a team leader often also calls on a
specialist whom he never before put on his team to handle a rare or new
prob- lem.</p>
<p>“It’s my job to decide that one of my accounts needs this or that
kind of service engi- neering,” said one account leader, himself a mold
designer. “Then it’s my job to bring in the right service engineer—a man
I know, trust, and can recommend to my customer. It’s then the service
engineer’s job to decide what needs to be done. And if he decides that
we have to redesign molds for the customer, then I have to go to work
and redesign molds until they satisfy the specifications for mold design
the service man lays down—he then becomes my ‘boss.’”</p>
<p>The same mold designer, in addition to heading the “account team” for
the company’s biggest and most profitable account, also considered
himself—and was considered by all the others—a member of two or three
other account teams. “They call me in, maybe half a dozen times a year,
when they have design problems that for them are fairly uncommon but are
daily occurrences on the account where I head the team,” the man
explains it. “And then I go to work for their team as a fairly junior
member and do whatever design- ing they need.”</p>
<p>Their Lessons</p>
<p>These two examples show that what characterizes a team is not “free
form” or the absence of regimentation. Teams at the plastic-mold company
are indeed highly flexible and with- out a rigid chain of command within
the team. Team leadership moves with the task. But few social
organizations around are as rigid as the hospital; a “rod” of command
rather than a chain of command characterizes hospital structure. Yet
both, the plastic-mold com- pany and the hospital, form and use genuine
teams.</p>
<p>Team design requires a continuing mission in which the specific tasks
change fre- quently, however. If there is no continuing mission, there
might be an ad hoc temporary task force—but not an organization based on
the team as a permanent design. If the tasks do not change, or if their
relative importance or sequence remain unchanged, there is no need for
team organization, and no point to it.</p>
<p>A team needs a clear and sharply defined objective. It must be
possible all the time to feed back from the objectives to the work and
performance of the whole team and of each member.</p>
<p>A task force needs leadership. It can be a permanent leader—physician
and nurse on the patient-care team in the hospital, or the recognized
head man on a top-management team. Or leadership can shift with each
major phase. But then, as in the mold-making company, one man needs to
be clearly designated to decide, at a given stage, who takes team
leadership for a particular phase of the task. It is not leadership
responsibility for making the decision and giving the command. It is
leadership responsibility for deciding who among the team members has,
for a particular phase and a particular challenge, the decision and
command authority (on this see also the discussion of the Japanese
approach to decision-making in Chapter 37). A team is therefore not
“democratic” if by that is meant that decisions are taken by vote. It
emphasizes authority. But the authority is task- derived and
task-focused.</p>
<p>It is always the team as a whole that is responsible for the task.
The individual con- tributes his particular skill and knowledge. But,
every individual is always responsible for the output and performance of
the entire team rather than only for his own work. The team is the
unit.</p>
<p>Team members need not know each other well to perform as a team. But
they do need to know each other’s function and potential contribution.
“Rapport,” “empathy,” “inter- personal relations” are not needed. Mutual
understanding of each other’s job and common understanding of the common
task are essential.</p>
<p>An example, is the team used to produce advertising or educational
movies.</p>
<p>In contrast to the teams used for TV programs or for large-scale
entertainment movies, crews for advertising or educational films are
usually composed of “freelancers” hired for one production, that is, for
anything from a few hours to a few weeks. Every director knows a dozen
technicians in each category—electricians, sound engineers, cameramen,
lighting people—with whom he has worked before and whom he trusts. He
knows of an- other half dozen men in each category and has heard good
things of them. Every one of the technicians; in turn, knows a number of
directors who meet his standards. But who is hired for a given
assignment depends on who is available at the time; and usually on very
short notice. As a result, the crew members often meet each other for
the first time a few minutes before production gets under way. Sometimes
they never learn each other’s names and address one other as “sound
engineer” or “lights” all the way through the as- signment. And yet they
immediately form a team. The director “calls the shots.” But the sound
engineer can and will stop the director and say, “I get a noise,” and
everything stops until the source of the noise is found and eliminated.
The cameramen can and will say, “I get a reflection off the wall,” and
everything stops until the lighting is adjusted. When the assignment is
over, the crew members go their own separate ways and may not meet again
for years. Yet while they belong to the same crew, they work closely
together as a team.</p>
<p>It is therefore the team leader’s first job to establish clarity:
clarity of objectives and clarity with respect to everybody’s role
including his own.</p>
<p>The Strengths and Limitations of the Team Principles</p>
<p>The team has obvious strengths. Everybody always knows the work of
the whole and holds himself responsible for it. It is highly receptive
to new ideas and new ways of doing things. And it has great
adaptability.</p>
<p>It also has great shortcomings. It does not possess clarity unless
the team leader cre- ates it. It has poor stability. Its economy is low;
a team demands continuing attention to its management, to the
relationships of people within the task force, to assigning people to
their jobs, to explanation, deliberation, communication, and so on. A
large part of the energy of all the members goes into keeping things
running. Although everybody on the team understands the common task, he
does not always understand his own specific task. He may be so
interested in what others are doing that he pays inadequate attention to
his own assignment.</p>
<p>Teams are adaptable. They are highly receptive to experimentation, to
new ideas, and to new ways of doing things. They are the best means
available for overcoming functional insulation and parochialism. Any
career professional should serve on a few teams during his working
life.</p>
<p>Still, teams do only a little better than straight functional
organization in preparing men for higher management responsibilities or
in testing them in performance. A team makes neither for clear
communications nor for clear decision-making. The whole group must work
constantly on explaining both to itself and to managers throughout the
rest of the organization what it is trying to do, what it is working on,
and what it has accom- plished. The team must constantly make sure that
the decisions that need to be made are brought into the open. These is
real danger otherwise that teams will make decisions they should not
make decisions, for instance, that irreversibly commit the whole
company.</p>
<p>In the plastic-mold company, for example, the “account teams” tend
all the time to make pricing decisions without telling anyone about
them. Yet, while meant for one cus- tomer only, these decisions
immediately affect the entire business.</p>
<p>Teams fail—and the failure rate has been high—primarily because they
do not impose on themselves the self-discipline and responsibility that
are required precisely because of the high degree of freedom team
organization gives. No task force can be “permissive” and function. This
is the reason why the same young educated people who clamor for</p>
<p>team work tend so often in reality to resist it. It makes tremendous
demands on self- discipline.</p>
<p>But the greatest limitation of the team structure is size. Teams work
best when there are few members. The aboriginal hunting band had seven
to fifteen members. So do the teams in team sports such as football,
baseball, and cricket. If a team gets much larger it becomes unwieldy.
Its strengths, such as flexibility and the sense of responsibility of
the members, attenuate. Its limitations—lack of clarity, communication
problems, over- concern with the internal mechanism and internal
relationship—become crippling weak- nesses.</p>
<p>The Scope of Team Organization</p>
<p>Its size limitation determines the scope of applicability of the team
principle of organiza- tion.</p>
<p>It is the best available design principle for top-management work.
Indeed (as will be discussed in Chapter 51) it is probably the only
appropriate design principle for top man- agement. Similarly, the team
is the preferred design principle for innovative work (see Chapter
61).</p>
<p>But for most operating work the team is not appropriate by itself and
alone as the de- sign principle of organization. It is a
complement—though a badly needed one. It may well be that it is team
organization that will make the functional principle fully effective and
will enable it to do what its designers had hoped for.</p>
<p>This may turn out to be the case with respect to mass-production work
(see Chapter 21). Mass production, especially “rigid” mass production,
is an extreme application of functional organization. Each man is a
“unit” with a specific function; and the work moves from one of these
human units of function to the next. Encouraging men to form teams
within the mass production system—as IBM has done for many years and as
some automobile plants are doing now—promises to result in both
productive work organized on the functional principle and in achieving
workers working in teams.</p>
<p>Team Design and Knowledge Organization</p>
<p>But the area where team design as a complement to functional
organization is likely to make the greatest contribution is in knowledge
work. The knowledge organization (see Chapter 35) is likely to balance
“function” as a man’s “home” with “team” as his “place of work.”</p>
<p>Knowledge work by definition is specialized work. The shift from
middle manage- ment to knowledge organization therefore brings into the
management group a host of specialists not as staff but as operating
people. The traditional pattern of typical functions is being replaced
by an enormous number of new functions. Of course many of them can, and
should, be grouped together. Still, while the tax specialist will often
be put together with other “financial” people, either in accounting or
in the treasurer’s department, his work is different and separate. This
also applies to product managers or market managers, who are equally
related to, and part of, the traditional marketing function, the
traditional research and development function, and the traditional
manufacturing function.</p>
<p>This requires better functional management. What specialties are
needed has to be de- cided or else the organization will drown in
useless and unused learning. There is need to think through what the key
activities are in which a high degree of specialized knowledge is needed
and to make sure that knowledge work in the key areas is provided for in
depth and with excellence. It also demands that knowledge work in other
areas either not be done at all or be kept in low key.</p>
<p>There is need to manage a specialty to make sure that it makes the
contribution to the enterprise for the sake of which it has been
established. There is need to anticipate today the new specialties that
will be needed tomorrow and the new demands that will be made tomorrow
on existing specialties. There is need, in other words, for functional
concern with what (in Chapter 33) I called management development.</p>
<p>There is great need for concern with, and for management of, the
specialists them- selves. Do they work on the truly important things, or
do they fritter away their time? Do they do over again what they already
know how to do, or do they work on creatirig new potential and new
performance capacity? Are they being used productively, or are they just
being kept busy? There is need also for concern with their development
as profes- sionals and as persons.</p>
<p>These are crucial questions which cannot be answered by checking how
many hours a man works. They require knowledge of the functional area
and genuine functional man- agement.</p>
<p>A good deal of knowledge work will undoubtedly be organized on a
strictly functional basis. A good deal will also be done by individuals
who, in effect, are an “organizational component” by themselves.</p>
<p>The tax expert is an example. He has a “home,” that is, he is usually
housed in some financial or accounting staff. But he really has no boss
except the company, and no cus- tomer except the company. And he has
little concern with what the other people in the accounting department
are doing. In fact, he is actually an outside consultant on the per-
manent payroll.</p>
<p>But these isolated individuals—tax expert and company lawyer, medical
director and government-relations counsel—rarely create organizational
or structural problems.</p>
<p>An increasing number of knowledge workers, however, will have a
“functional” home but do their work in a team with other knowledge
workers from other functions and disci- plines. The more advanced the
knowledge worker’s knowledge the more likely it is that he will do his
work and make his contribution in cross-functional teams rather than in
his own functional component. For the more advanced knowledge is the
more specialized it has to be. And specialized knowledge is a fragment,
if not mere “data.” It becomes pro- ductive only if put together with
other people’s knowledge. It becomes effective only as input to other
people’s decisions, other people’s work, other people’s understanding.
It becomes “results” only in a team.</p>
<p>Knowledge organization will therefore increasingly have two axes: a
functional one, managing the man and his knowledge; another one the
team, managing work and task. Seen one way, this undermines the
functional principle and destroys it. Seen another way, it saves the
functional principle and makes it fully effective. It certainly requires
strong, professional, effective, functional managers and functional
components.</p>
<p>The team is clearly not the panacea advertised by a good deal of the
discussion of the “small group” and “free-form organization.” It is a
difficult structure requiring very great self-discipline. It has severe
limitations and major weaknesses.</p>
<p>But it is also not, as many managers still believe, a temporary
expedient for dealing with nonrecurring “special problems.” It is a
genuine design principle of organization. It is the best principle for
such permanent organizing tasks as top-management work and innovating
work. And it is an important and perhaps essential complement to
functional structure—in mass-production work, whether manual or
clerical, and above all, in knowl- edge work. It is the key, in all
probability, to making functional skill fully effective in the knowledge
organization.</p>
