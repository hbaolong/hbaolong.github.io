<p>THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION raises diversity and complexity to new
levels and makes new and unprecedented demands on top management with
respect to business strategy as well as structure and behavior.</p>
<p>The multinational corporation is the outstanding social innovation of
the period since World War II—a period otherwise lacking in social
innovation and in social imagination. It has become the foremost
non-nationalist institution in a world torn asunder by parox- ysms of
nationalist fever and an organ of integration in a world of political
fission. This makes the multinational corporation important beyond its
service as a business institution. But this also makes the multinational
corporation a difficult and problematical institution. Indeed, the
testing period is still ahead for the multinational corporation. If it
cannot re- solve the contradictions it has created, both internally and
externally, as a result of being multinational in a nationalistic world,
it is unlikely to prosper. For the multinational cor- poration is both
cause and result—but also symbol—of a most profound event of the post-
World War II period—the split between economy and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Multinational public-service institutions are lacking so far. There
are “international agencies,” but they are, for the most part,
coordinating, rule-making, or research organiza- tions rather than
actors and performers. The only truly multinational public-service agen-
cies capable of action in their own right rather than as agents of
governments are the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (the
latter, especially, since Interna- tional Drawing Rights were introduced
as a supplementary “key currency” in 1971) and both, of course, reflect
the same reality of a world economy distinct from political sover-
eignties that underlies the rise of the multinational corporation.</p>
<p>However, just as the economy is in the process of splitting off from
sovereignty, so is the ecology. Truly transnational environmental
organizations capable of acting and per- forming in their own right and
without regard to national boundary lines are urgently</p>
<p>needed. “Pollution” may be a local phenomenon, comparable with (and
indeed closely linked to) production. But environment is becoming
worldwide just as the economy is in the process of becoming. In dealing
with oceans and ocean beds, air resources and cli- mate, soil and raw
material resources, “sovereignties,” even those of the biggest and larg-
est nations, are increasingly coming to be seen as restraints rather
than as the carriers of effective action. The multinational corporation
may therefore well become the prototype and forerunner of a truly
multinational public-service agency of tomorrow just as, domes- tically,
the management of business can now be seen to have been the forerunner
and pro- totype of “management” for public-service institutions. And the
multinational environ- mental agency of tomorrow will, predictably,
encounter all the problems and questions of the multinational
corporation of today, both internally and in its relationships to the
multi- tude of political sovereigns, i.e., nation-states, their
governments, but also their cultures and values.</p>
<p>This chapter discusses businesses and uses only business examples and
business illus- trations—it is all we have so far. But everything said
in it should be applicable to the mul- tinational public-service
institution if and when it emerges.</p>
<p>If multinationalism is the most dramatic economic development since
World War II, it is also the least understood. Myths abound regarding
the multinational corporation. It is commonly believed to be something
radically new and indeed unprecedented. But it is also the revival of an
old trend. There were multinationals galore in the nineteenth cen- tury.
And the fear of the multinationals is nothing new either. The most
articulate outcry against being “taken over by the Americans” can be
found in English books and magazine articles of 1900.</p>
<p>Both in the United States and in Europe, major scientific and
technical inventions of the nineteenth century led almost immediately to
the emergence of multinational corpora- tions; that is, of companies
that were making and selling goods in many countries. This was the case
with Siemens in the 1850s; the English subsidiary was founded almost im-
mediately after the German parent company, as was a subsidiary in
Russia; for long years these subsidiaries almost overshadowed the German
parent. McCormick’s harvester and the reaper-thresher of his English
rival, Fowler, also went multinational in the nineteenth century. So did
Singer’s sewing machine and the Remington typewriter within a few years
after the original patents had been issued. The trend accelerated in the
early twentieth century when, for instance, the Swiss chemical and
pharmaceutical companies became multinational. Fiat and Ford both
established subsidiaries abroad within a few years of their founding. In
the 1520s such prototypes of the multinational businesses of today as
Unilever and Royal Dutch/Shell were established.</p>
<p>The surge of the multinationals in the fifties and sixties
represented in large measure a resumption of the pre-World War I trend
rather than a totally new development. It ex- pressed a return of the
economic vitality and capacity to grow which World War I had paralyzed.
Even in form, the multinationals of the present closely resemble the
pre-World War I development: a parent company with wholly-owned
subsidiaries and affiliates in other countries. Unilever and Royal
Dutch/Shell—the Anglo-Dutch companies with two parent companies in two
countries and with top management and headquarters in two countries—are
far more truly multinational in their structure than the new
multinationals of the recent past.</p>
<p>In some areas, indeed, there was more multinationalism in the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries than there is today. Before
World War I, for instance, two insurance companies domiciled in
Trieste—then part of Austria-Hungary—were writing large amounts of life
insurance through subsidiaries in thirty to forty countries all over the
world, in Europe, in Latin America and Africa, on mainland China, and in
Russia.</p>
<p>Another myth about the multinational corporation is that it is
entirely or primarily an American development. To be sure when the
development got going in the fifties, it did so under the leadership of
American companies. The reason for this was in part American economic
and financial strength during this period. More important, however, were
the economic policies of European governments. Despite the Common
Market, the govern-</p>
<p>ments of Europe for a long time were unwilling to let their
businesses become European businesses. Mergers or even “communities of
interest” across the national boundaries of Europe were discouraged and
frowned upon by most European governments (the British being the
exception). It was therefore left to the Americans to avail themselves
of the op- portunities which the Common Market created. It is not too
much exaggeration to say (as Servan-Schreiber did in The American
Challenge, 1968) that it is largely the American initiative which
converted the Common Market from good intentions into economic real-
ity.</p>
<p>But the phase in which the leadership in the development of
multinational corpora- tions was in American hands came to an end in the
mid-sixties. Since then, non-American businesses have taken the lead. By
the early 1970s a little more than half of the business done by the
multinationals was still done by companies headquartered in the United
States. The other half was done by companies headquartered in many other
places and managed as Dutch, Swiss, German, Swedish, French, English,
Japanese—and in a few cases, Latin American—companies. By the mid-1960s
the movement toward multination- alism had become general. The growth of
the non-American multinationals since had been far faster than that of
the American-based ones. And it promises to be faster still. The
Pan-European company, in particular, is likely to emerge as a major
factor in the world economy.</p>
<p>Another prevailing myth is that multinational business development is
confined to big business. A prediction widely quoted in the early
seventies asserted that by the mid- eighties of this century the entire
manufacturing of the world would be in the hands of three hundred large
multinational world companies, each doing business worldwide, and each
doing many billion dollars in sales.</p>
<p>Actually multinational companies come in as many sizes as national
companies do.</p>
<p>The concentration of economic power is not necessarily greater in the
multinational sector than it is within any national economy. Small
multinational businesses may even have proportionately grown faster all
along and may have done better. They just do not make the headlines.</p>
<p>Such small to medium-sized companies are building a multinational
business on excel- lence and leadership in one small ecological niche.
Here are some examples:</p>
<p>A Swiss-based company doing precision mechanics employs 1,800 people
all over the world for a total sales volume of less than 0 million. It
operates in almost fifty countries and manufactures in almost a dozen
countries. It has grown from fifty employees in 1960; that is, it has
grown more than thirty-fold in a dozen years.</p>
<p>There is, similarly, an American-based company of about the same
size. When it started to go multinational, it employed only about one
hundred people in Southern Cali- fornia. Ten years later it did business
in some thirty countries with manufacturing plants in half a dozen:
Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, Brazil; and, in joint ventures, Japan
and Yugoslavia. It also built on the basis of leadership in a very small
but highly demanding branch of technology on the boundary between
chemistry and metallurgy.</p>
<p>There is the company which supplies spare parts for aircraft to most
of the smaller air- lines of the world, with warehouses and maintenance
facilities from Accra to the Fiji Is- lands and Warsaw. There is the
small New York Stock Exchange firm specializing in research for
institutional investors which has offices and partners in London,
Brussels, and Hong Kong, and which serves as many institutional
investment clients outside of the United States as it does within the
United States.</p>
<p>These are still small businesses and likely to remain so. Yet they
have become as fully multinational as the big companies.</p>
<p>The idea that it is manufacturing that has gone multinational is a
misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The fastest growth has been in finance, where the large American
commercial banks went multinational before their clients did.</p>
<p>The most dramatic development on the multinational front are the new
“consortium”</p>
<p>banks in which large and medium-sized commercial banks pool their
resources in a joint venture to become multinational “universal banks.”
One example is CCB, the group</p>
<p>formed by the German Commerz Bank, the French Crédit Lyonnais, and
the Italian Banco di Roma. Other consortium banks have British,
American, Canadian, Brazilian, Belgian, Dutch, Japanese, Australian,
Austrian, and Scandinavian partners.</p>
<p>The management consultants, the auditors, and the advertising
agencies have also moved well ahead of the American-based manufacturing
companies. And Sears, Roebuck started to go multinational in the late
l940s when it moved simultaneously into Canada and into Latin America,
and later on, in the 1960s, into a number of European countries. In
fact, the Sears, Roebuck store may have had greater impact on economy
and society of Latin America, in Peru, in Colombia, and in Brazil, than
any of the manufacturing com- panies that established subsidiaries in
Latin American countries. And when Britain de- cided in 1972 to join the
Common Market, retailers such as Lyons and Marks andandandand Spencer
moved much faster to become “European” than did manufacturers.</p>
<p>The period of most rapid growth of multinationals—the fifties and
sixties—was the period of the most rapid growth of international trade.
Indeed, during this period the world trading economy grew faster—at an
annual rate of 15 percent or so in most years— than even the fastest
growing domestic economy, i.e., that of Japan. And the Japanese clearly
could not have grown at the rate they did if protectionism had made
impossible economic expansion based on exports abroad. It is not in the
most heavily protected in- dustries where multinationalism has forged
ahead the fastest. It came late, for instance, in the chemical industry,
which is very heavily protected. But pharmaceuticals, where pro- tection
plays a minor role, was a leader from the start. And there has been
almost no mul- tinationalism in the heavily protected steel
industry.</p>
<p>But the best proof that protectionism is not at the bottom of the
multinational trend is the European development. The rise of the
multinationals began when continental Europe abolished protection and
joined in a common market. The common belief that the growth of the
multinational companies has to do with trade restrictions will not hold
up. The mul- tinationals create export markets for their country’s
products. The multinational’s subsidi- ary abroad is the best market for
its home country’s machinery, its chemical intermedi- ates, and so
on.</p>
<p>This shows clearly in American trade figures. Neither the export
markets which Amer- ica has been losing nor the markets in which imports
have become important in the U.S. are those in which American
multinationals are active. The American textile companies are still
almost completely domestic. So are the American producers of chinaware,
of flat glass, and of shoes. The foreign automobiles which have taken an
increasing share of the American market are not those the overseas
subsidiaries of the American automobile companies make. They are
Volkswagens, Renaults, and Toyotas. But of the American exports, an
increasing share, perhaps amounting to as much as one-third of the
exports of manufactured goods in the late sixties and early seventies,
were exports by the same com- panies that vigorously expanded
multinationally, and were, above all, exports to the sub- sidiaries of
such companies abroad. Very much the same thing applies to the Dutch,
Swiss, Swedish, German, and Italian balances of trade.</p>
<p>Multinationalism and expanding world trade are two sides of the same
coin. And far from being a cause of multinationalism, protectionism is
incompatible with it. Indeed, an emergence of protectionism would be the
greatest threat to the multinational corporation.</p>
<p>The Common World Market</p>
<p>The true explanation of the explosive upsurge of the multinational
corporation is some- thing far more important than either American
economic strength or protectionism. It is the emergence of a genuine
world market, that is, a market which is not limited or defined by
national, cultural, or even ideological boundaries, but transcends them.
The market is</p>
<p>no longer even international but increasingly “non-national,” and
based on common worldwide demands and expectations.</p>
<p>The great and unprecedented event of the post-World War II period is
the fact that country after country, as its income and, above all, its
information, increased, developed the same or similar demand patterns.
This was unexpected. When World War II came to an end, it was “known”
that the European countries and Japan, should they ever regain economic
health, would develop different demand patterns. No one then doubted
that an economically recovered France would surely have appetites and
demands totally different from the United States, but also from Japan,
from the Soviet Union, from Germany, or probably even from neighboring
Belgium. This certainty—a certainty grounded in the reality of
nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century experience—explains why such
differ- ent people as De Gaulle and Khrushchev considered the emergence
of a common demand, that is, of a genuine worldwide market, as
“abnormal” and proof of some sort of “conspir- acy.”</p>
<p>By now we know that all the talk in the 1950s about the
“Coca-Cola-ization” of Europe was nonsense. It was not that Europe
became “Americanized.” It was simply that the mass market, the
“post-industrial” market, to use a slogan of the sociologists, had first
become visible and overt in the United States. But when conditions
appeared that were similar to those in the United States—not so much,
however, higher incomes as greater mobility and a wider horizon of
information—the demand pattern all over the world proved to be the
same.</p>
<p>This does not necessarily mean that the same goods and services have
a worldwide market, and that what sells in one area will sell in
another.</p>
<p>A cautionary tale is the failure of one of the big multinational food
processors to in- troduce dehydrated soups into the American market. In
Europe these soups had become a main pillar of the company’s success,
had become immensely popular and were growing fast. When introduced into
the U.S., they failed. It turned out that what is high conven- ience for
the European housewife means nothing to the American housewife. The
light weight of a dehydrated product as against a heavy can means little
to a woman who goes shopping by car. And the small bulk of a dehydrated
product has little appeal to a woman who has ample space in her kitchen,
as the American housewife has. Its longer prepara- tion time and its
shorter shelf life, carrying with it a danger of rancidity, make the
dehy- drated soup less convenient than the canned soup despite the
latter’s weight and bulk.</p>
<p>But housewives—American, European, Japanese, and all the others—want
conven- ience and are willing to pay for it.</p>
<p>The demand pattern that has emerged in the world economy is not the
demand pattern the economists expected. The customer proved again that
he knew better than the experts what he wanted.</p>
<p>The great demand has been for a little mobility—and a little
power—that is, for such satisfactions as the automobile gives; earlier
they had been inaccessible to any but a few very rich and very powerful.
Another common demand is for a little health care so that a child has a
fair chance to live to adulthood in a reasonable state of physical
health and unscarred by disease or crippling deformation. It is demand
for a little education. It is demand for access to a big world, which is
what the news media, the movie, the radio, the television set offer to
the masses who for millennia were limited in their knowledge, their
horizon, and their vision, to the confining valley around them and to
the small town in which everybody knew everybody else and in which
everybody lived exactly the same life. And then there is the desire for
the “small luxuries,” for the things that are, in effect, assertions of
personality over the confinement of poverty—the lipstick, the candy bar,
the soft drink, and the ballerina slipper.</p>
<p>These have emerged as the universal demands. They are not based on
affluence. They are based on something far more potent: information. If
the world has not, as Marshall</p>
<p>McLuhan announced, become a “global village,” it surely has become a
“global shopping center.”</p>
<p>One effect of the change in the world economy is that every business
from now on, even a purely local one, will in effect have to be managed
as if it operated in a worldwide economy, even though it sells only in a
small district. It will have to be international in its vision, just as
a business operating in, say, southwest Bavaria has long had to be “Ger-
man” in its vision, or a business operating in northern Michigan
“American” in its vision. Just as that German business in Bavaria or the
Michigan business in America has to un- derstand and know its own
national economy even though it does not operate in any but a small
corner thereof, so will any business henceforth have to understand the
major cur- rents and trends of the world economy.</p>
<p>This development cannot be undone. Protectionism could indeed make
the world economy poor and impede its functioning to the point of near
collapse. But it cannot de- stroy the common demands. It cannot undo the
worldwide horizon and vision. The fun- damental change has happened
irrevocably. The question is not whether it will remain. The question is
whether it can be turned to advantage—for society, for the individual,
and for the business enterprise.</p>
<p>And the multinational corporation is both the response to the
emergence of a common world market and its symbol.</p>
<p>The World Market as Integrator</p>
<p>A market integrates. It converts “resources” into “factors of
production.” The national markets—the great achievement of the
“commercial revolution” of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries—integrated “factors of production” within a national economy.
The common world market, as it is emerging now, integrates the same
factors of production within a world economy.</p>
<p>The traditional theory of the international economy still sees
countries having “com- parative advantages” with respect to their
“factorial costs.” And insofar as they produce those things in which
they have the greatest advantage, everybody’s resources will be
optimized. The guiding example is still Adam Smith’s exchange of English
wool against Portuguese wine. In this theory the individual country is
the market that integrates the factors of production. And what is being
traded are finished goods. Goods are mobile. The factors of production
stay put.</p>
<p>But with a common world economy as the integrator, it is no longer a
country that is the unit of production. The goods are the same
everywhere—or pretty much so. The mo- bility is in the factors of
production. Whereas international trade meant trade in goods or
services, it now increasingly means trade in the factors of
production.</p>
<p>To be specific, the most advanced multinational of the nineteenth
century was proba- bly Singer Sewing Machines with big, ultramodern
plants in Scotland, France, Russia, Japan, and many other places, in
addition to the original plant in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The Scottish
plant at Clydeside near Glasgow was probably a more efficient plant with
lower costs than the Bridgeport plant; it was also the bigger plant. It
produced the same machines Bridgeport produced; and it produced the full
range of Singer machines. But even though tariff walls were minimal in
those days, Clydeside produced only for the British market; at the same
time it produced everything Singer sold in Britain.</p>
<p>Compare this to the multinational of today. A major pharmaceutical
company sells drugs in more than eighty countries of the world. In each
of these countries it sells its en- tire product line. It has
manufacturing plants in eleven countries: the U.S., Canada, Mex- ico,
and Brazil in the Americas; in Britain, France, Germany, and Italy in
Europe; in South Africa, Japan, and Australia. Only a few of the main
drug products in the com- pany’s line are made by all eleven plants.
Most of the company’s drugs are made in only one plant, a few in two or
three. Even the U.S. plants do not turn out the full product line. As a
result, each of the plants sells some drugs to every one of the
eighty-odd sales com- panies; and every one of these sales companies
buys some drugs from each of the eleven</p>
<p>manufacturing plants. Pharmaceutical drugs are made from chemical
intermediates, e.g., from citric acid, which is the chemical base for
many antibiotics. The company manufac- tures intermediates in seven
countries: U.S., Mexico, Ireland, Great Britain, France, Aus- tralia,
and Japan. Again, no country makes all the intermediates—each
specializes. Each therefore supplies all eleven manufacturing plants.
But each also sells a good part of its output—in some cases, more than
half—directly on the outside to other competing phar- maceutical
companies and to a wide range of chemical manufacturers. Research,
finally, is being carried on in four countries—the U.S., Britain,
France, and Japan, with a fifth research lab, in Brazil, to open in the
mid-seventies. Again, each lab is specialized. The French lab, for
instance, does all the company’s research on central-nervous-system
drugs but also all the work to convert drugs originally designed for the
treatment of human dis- eases into drugs suitable for the veterinarian.
And a drug developed by any one of these four research labs may be put
into chemical testing and market introduction first in any one of the
eighty countries in which the company operates.</p>
<p>But it is not only the—admittedly complex—pharmaceutical industry
that integrates factors of production rather than trade in goods.</p>
<p>The most successful Detroit-designed “small” car, Ford’s Pinto, gets
its engine from Ford’s German company, its transmission from Ford’s
British company, and much of its electrical system from Ford’s Canadian
company—but is sold exclusively in the U.S. and by Ford’s American
company. Similarly, major components for the Volkswagen sold in the U.S.
are being made by Volkswagen do Brazil in São Paulo.</p>
<p>When it was announced in the spring of 1972 that all British
government agencies would henceforth buy their computers from the one
British computer company, ICL, the British subsidiary of the American
Honeywell company pointed out in protest that its computers, though made
by an American-owned company, contained a larger proportion of
British-made components than the computers of British-owned ICL.</p>
<p>In the services areas, this integration of the factors of production
within a common world market has gone even further.</p>
<p>A major U.S. bank arranged a 5 million, five-year loan for a Japanese
manufactur- ing company in early 1971. The deal was initiated in Tokyo
and by the bank’s Japanese representative. The deal was worked out by
the bank’s offices in London and Frankfurt. The syndicate that advanced
the money contained eight banks, one each from the U.S., Japan, Great
Britain, Holland, Sweden, France, Switzerland, and Latin America. Most
of the money was raised in Germany, where interest rates at the time
were favorable. And the purpose of the loan was to finance a
manufacturing subsidiary of the Japanese com- pany in Latin America. Yet
this was a routine transaction such as each of the participating banks
engages in every week.</p>
<p>So far, most multinationals are still cast in the nineteenth-century,
Singer Sewing Ma- chine mold—that is, each subsidiary makes products or
furnishes services for its own dis- crete national market. But the trend
is toward the integration of the factors of production for a common
worldwide market. It is the trend that follows from the logic of the
market itself.</p>
<p>The term multinational is of very recent coinage: it was unknown even
twenty years ago. It fits the nineteenth-century structure—Singer Sewing
Machine—much better than it fits the development to which it is being
applied. Singer Sewing Machine was truly “mul- tinational.” But the
pharmaceutical company that integrates eleven drug-manufacturing plants,
seven intermediate plants, and four research labs into sales of many
drug products in eighty countries is not multinational. It is
“transnational.” And so is the automobile company that integrates plants
in Germany, Britain, Mexico, and Canada for a sale in the U.S., or the
commercial bank that integrates banking resources in eight countries to
raise money in a ninth country to finance a development in a tenth
country. National bounda- ries are no longer determinants. They are
restraints, obstacles, complications. What de- termines is the reality
of a non-national common market.</p>
<p>The term multinational, in other words, obscures reality rather than
explains it. It is by now, however, probably too deeply entrenched. Even
though it will have to be used, it</p>
<p>The Split Between Economy and Sovereignty</p>
<p>The development of a common world market has not been paralleled by
the development of a world political community. The years during which
the world economy created a demand for multinational business were years
of continuing splintering in the world po- litical system. The world
political system is still based on the concept of the national sov-
ereign state. For the first time, therefore, in three hundred years
economy and sovereignty are becoming divorced from each other.</p>
<p>Such divorce was normal until the seventeenth century. Indeed, no one
up to that time conceived a unity of economic entity and political
entity. The unit of economic activity was first and foremost a local
agricultural community, such as the medieval manor, pro- ducing most of
the things it consumed. And the other unit was long-distance trade,
totally divorced from any political system and carried out by merchants
of trading cities who, in effect, constituted a transnational and
closely integrated trading society. The bankruptcy in 1557 of the
Spanish Crown, Europe’s leading political power of the time—a traumatic
event without precedent—brought the intercity merchant society crashing
down in finan- cial ruin from which it never recovered. But it also
demonstrated to the emerging national rulers that to have political
sovereignty, they had to take control of their own money and credit
system and with it of their own economy. (See also the discussion of
mercantilism in Chapter 27.)</p>
<p>The idea of a “national economy” as it emerged in the seventeenth
century conceived for the first time of the political sovereign as
engaged in economic as well as in political and military competition.
The last remnants of the old separation of political sovereignty and
economy, the international gold standard, then disappeared in the
aftermath of World War I.</p>
<p>But while the victory of the national state as the economic sovereign
seemed com- plete—and became indeed the major tenet of Keynesian
economics in the interwar pe- riod—the postwar period has seen an abrupt
reversal of what for three hundred years seemed a law of nature. It has
seen the emergence of an autonomous world economy which is not just the
sum of national economies.</p>
<p>The clearest symptom of this is to be found in the financial sphere.
When the U.S.</p>
<p>government, in 1967, tried to stop the multinational expansion of
American companies and restricted the investment of U.S. funds abroad (a
move prompted as much by pressure from America’s allies, such as De
Gaulle’s France, as by concern for the U.S. balance of payments), the
world economy successfully nullified the decree of the world’s most pow-
erful government. It immediately created the Eurodollar market (see also
Chapter 7) which took over the financing of the multinationals—a market
which essentially made European funds available to the American
companies for their expansion in Europe.</p>
<p>Few governments, even during the heyday of mercantilism, have
suffered from the de- lusion that they are truly “independent”
economically. It always had to be recognized that the outside world
exerts powerful influence on the domestic economy even of the strong-
est country, and that it sets very real limits on the freedom of action
of the political sover- eign. “Autarky,” most governments knew, was a
delusion (though the United States gov- ernment, and especially the U.S.
Congress, have frequently been victims of the delusion that their
economy is, so to speak, on a separate planet and that U.S. policy, U.S.
regula- tions, and U.S. fiat can operate independent of outside economic
realities). But it has been for three hundred years the basic aim of
national policy to keep this outside force and</p>
<p>restraint to a minimum; to do so constituted the essence of national
sovereignty. The emergence of the multinationals, while an effect rather
than a cause of a fundamental change, is therefore a direct challenge to
deeply rooted convictions, to deeply entrenched political institutions,
and to habits of the mind, now three hundred years old. It is not only
that the emergence of businesses which are multinational contradicts the
doctrine—by now considered axiom by most—of the national state as the
“natural” unit of organization for every sphere of human and social
activity. It also contradicts the doctrine—heresy three hundred years
ago, but by now a comfortable article of faith—that every institution of
society must, ultimately, base its legitimacy and derive its
constitution from the govern- ing organ of the sovereign state, the
national government.</p>
<p>What makes the multinational business so important is precisely that
it challenges these axioms.* It is the first non-national institution—at
least it is the first modern institu- tion of importance which considers
national boundaries an incident and a restraint rather than part of its
own definition and identity. And this, in a world that threatens to be
de- stroyed by nationalist passions, is an important institution. But it
is by that token also a problematical and endangered one.</p>
<p>So far we have no theory, whether political, social, or economic, to
account for the re- ality of the world economy and therefore for the
behavior of the multinational corpora- tion. The only, theories we have
are those of the “national economy,” that is, the seven- teenth-century
theories of national sovereignty. This need not surprise anybody.
Theories follow events. One can only codify what has already
happened.</p>
<p>But it means that the multinational corporation has to grope its way,
has to improvise as it goes along, has to experiment and test rather
than proceed along clearly understood lines and on the basis of firmly
grasped principles.</p>
<p>It means also that the multinational corporation is an
extraordinarily difficult structure.</p>
<p>It presents difficulties internally, with regard to its basic
business strategy, its manage- ment structure, and its managerial
relationships. It represents new problems with regard to its external
existence in its environment, and with regard to its relationship to the
national state in which it does its business and into whose political
jurisdiction it inevitably falls— there being no other political
jurisdiction available.</p>
<p>Even if, as some people suggest, multinational corporations could
incorporate with some international or supranational agency, the United
Nations, for instance, or a Euro- pean Parliament, they would still be
multicultural. For it is not only political sovereignty that is
national. Different peoples have different cultures, beginning with
their language. This is bound to become more of a problem as the world
economy becomes more univer- sal. The more homogeneous economically the
world becomes—in its appetites, at least, if not in its actual economic
conditions—the more will local and cultural roots be needed. People need
a home—and even the most luxurious 2,000-room hotel is not a “home.”
Managing the multinational corporation is therefore largely a problem of
integrating po- litical and cultural diversity into managerial
unity.</p>
<p>The Problems of Strategy</p>
<p>What distinguishes the multinational corporation from any other
business is that it faces both internal and external diversity. It has
to create unity within its own managerial or- ganization and yet do
justice to the diversity of peoples, nationalities, and loyalties within
it. And it has to create a unified business that can optimize factorial
costs and factorial advantages within a common world market and yet live
in peace—or at least without con- stant conflict—with a multitude of
separate political sovereignties.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical company mentioned earlier needs a strategy for the
company as a whole. But each of the eighty-odd national companies needs
one as well. So do the manu- facturing units, the units making
intermediates and the research laboratories. Each has to</p>
<p>*One of the best books on the multinational corporation is
Sovereignty at Bay by Raymond Vernon, (Basic Books, 1971): this may be
exaggeration—but sovereignty is being challenged.</p>
<p>be managed as an autonomous business with its own objectives, its own
priorities and plans, its own profit and loss responsibility.</p>
<p>But at the same time, none of these units is truly autonomous. All
are interdependent.</p>
<p>It may, for instance, seem to be purely a concern of the subsidiary
in a given Latin Ameri- can country whether to accept an offer from the
country’s national health service of a con- tract that guarantees a
sizable market for a drug for five years but at a 25 percent reduc- tion
in price. Yet such a price concession may set off demands for lower
prices from the health services of other Latin American countries—and
without any five-year purchase guarantee. It may appear purely a matter
for one of the intermediate plants within the sys- tem whether it
decides to expand its facilities because outside customers, that is,
other pharmaceutical manufacturers, are increasing their uses of a
substance it makes. But this immediately raises the question whether the
company’s own plants for finished products are to be considered
preferred customers whose orders will be given priority, or whether the
new outside customers are to be considered as preferred customers, or at
least as equals. If the first line is taken, the company decides in
effect to optimize its own manu- facturing unit’s results at the expense
of sub-optimizing the results of the intermediate unit. If the second
alternative is taken, the company decides, in effect, that being an in-
termediate manufacturer is more advantageous than being a drug
manufacturer.</p>
<p>These are strategic decisions. They have long-term—and often
irreversible—impact.</p>
<p>They cannot be made by “the top” alone. They require local knowledge.
But they cannot be made locally either. They affect the whole company
and must be made at the top. A multinational strategy which takes into
account only the overall company is condemned to futility. Unless it can
be translated into specific strategy for individual markets, it cannot
succeed. But the multinational strategy which is decentralized, that is,
a strategy which considers each unit and each market as an autonomous
business, is equally condemned to futility. And it is
impossible—theoretically as well as practically—to predict in advance
whether the company-wide, overall approach to strategy or the
market-by-market ap- proach to strategy will be appropriate to a given
situation.</p>
<p>The large-scale commercial banks have a similar problem. It is their
very strength—it is indeed the reason for their existence as
multinationals—that they can give financial service anyplace in the
world. Equally it is their strength that they can offer one-stop
banking—that is, that they can satisfy the major financial needs of a
customer, whether for short-term money or for long-term loans, and even
for equity capital, whether in dol- lars, in German marks, or in
Japanese yen. This, however, requires one strategy which focuses on the
needs of a major customer, such as, for instance, one of the big
interna- tional companies, wherever they might arise. Whoever is in
charge of this particular area, e.g., the major airlines, therefore has
to look upon the entire bank as one business, as one resource, as one
pool of capital, and as one pool of services. But at the same time, the
bank’s manager in any one particular market needs a strategy for his
business. He needs to think through which companies in, for instance,
Japan, are potential customers and for what services of the bank. He
needs to be able to mobilize the resources of the bank worldwide for
their needs. But he also needs to build up a purely local business. For
the multinational customers of today are, as a rule, yesterday’s
satisfied local customers. Again, neither one global, bank-wide strategy
nor local strategies can suffice. The bank needs both—and can never say
in advance which of the two should come first, or which of the two
actually govern a particular business relationship.</p>
<p>Few multinationals have thought through business strategy so far. One
exception might be Unilever, which, for many years, has systematically
planned both for the entire Unilever group, for major product lines
within, such as edible oils and fats (margarine), soaps and detergents
or fish, and for each major country. Fiat, in its deliberate policy of
encouraging government-owned but Fiat-built automobile plants in
communist Eastern Europe may be another example. A more recent and so
far not yet truly tried case is Phil- ips in Holland, with business
strategies both for major product groups—of which Philips has
sixteen—and for each of the countries in which Philips does business. No
American company, to my knowledge, has so far done anything
comparable.</p>
<p>But every multinational company faces the complexity of business
strategy, precisely because it has to be both unified for the entire
company and specific for each major prod- uct category as well as for
each major market. This means that the multinational has com- plexity
built into its very structure. It is multicultural, it is multinational,
it is multi- market, and also multi-management.</p>
<p>Adding to this a diversity of businesses makes the company
unmanageable.</p>
<p>The successful multinationals are in effect single-market or
single-technology compa- nies. There is IBM, which has only one product.
There are the pharmaceutical companies which have only one customer, the
physician. There are the multinational commercial banks which have only
one technology: financing business. There is Sony, which is the most
multinational of all Japanese companies with almost half of its sales
and profits coming from outside of Japan—yet concentrated on consumer
electronics, and on a fairly small range at that. There is ADELA, the
multinational venture banker in Lima, Peru, which concentrates on Latin
America. And the multinational business services—the man- agement
consultants, the public accountants, and the advertising agencies which
may have grown even faster than the multinational businesses
themselves—are also, of course, highly concentrated in what they “make”
and in what they “sell.”</p>
<p>Without such fundamental business unity, the multinational company
splinters into fragments. Management people lose the ability to
understand each other, even with the help of an interpreter. The company
then rapidly degenerates into a bureaucracy which adds more layers the
less it truly directs and controls. The temptation to diversify, no mat-
ter how great in any given case, should be firmly resisted in a
multinational corporation. The multinational conglomerate is an
abomination.</p>
<p>The Top-Management Teams</p>
<p>Of necessity, the multinational has not one but many top-management
teams. It has as many top-management teams as it has business
strategies. Corporate top management is one such team. But for each
country, region, or product line there is another team. Insofar as
members of the corporate top management also sit on a top-management
team for a country or a market they are members thereof, rather than the
team leader.</p>
<p>No one so far has found a satisfactory answer to the problem of
top-management structure in the large multinational corporation. One
thing, however, is clear. The tradi- tional pattern is not the
answer.</p>
<p>The traditional pattern constructs towering hierarchies in which
levels are heaped on levels. The head of a national company typically
reports to a regional executive who re- ports to another regional
level—such as a European or a Latin American executive—who in turn
reports to an, international vice-president who in turn then reports to
corporate top management. This not only denigrates the man who has to
make the actual decisions, that is, the head of a business in a given
country, it also creates a cumbersome bureaucracy, the main achievement
of which is to delay decisions.</p>
<p>Some alternatives to this pattern can already be seen, and they do
offer advantages.</p>
<p>The most satisfactory structure is perhaps that which Unilever has
been developing.</p>
<p>There each company in any country reports to one of the two head
offices of the parent company, that is, either to London or to
Rotterdam. But for each of the major product groups, e.g., soaps or fish
or retail trade, there is a coordinating committee at headquar- ters,
usually composed of people who have successfully operated businesses in
the par- ticular area. And within each major country, such as Germany,
where Unilever has a number of companies, there is a “national board”
composed of former senior executives of the companies in the country and
chaired, as a rule, by a distinguished citizen of the country. This is
cumbersome enough. But at least the head of a Unilever company, wher-
ever he might be, has direct access to top-management people who can
make a decision. Normally he will not use the right of access. He will
rather work with his national board or with the committee in his product
area. But organizationally he reports directly to top</p>
<p>management. And this status within the company gives him status
outside, within the in- dustry in his country, with the country’s
government, with labor unions, and so on.</p>
<p>But even within Unilever the balance between the need to look upon
each company, as an autonomous business, the need to look upon each
major product area as a unified busi- ness in its own right, and the
need to look upon the whole company as a unit, in terms of capital
appropriation or of key personnel, for instance, is difficult,
precarious, and easily upset. At the very least, far too much time is
spent on working out organizational relation- ships and on keeping the
system going.</p>
<p>There are other alternatives.</p>
<p>One of the leading American multinationals, CPC (formerly Corn
Products), has or- ganized itself into five distinct companies: two
American ones (consumer goods and in- dustrial products), a European
one, a Latin American one, and a Far Eastern one. Each is headed by its
own president whose headquarters are within his territory. The company’s
top-management team of three or four men constitutes the board of each
of these compa-</p>
<p>nies. It spends equal time working with the presidents of each of
these companies and their senior men, at their locations, acting as the
presidents, advisors, review organ, and resource.</p>
<p>Only one organizational conclusion has emerged clearly. In the
multinational, the top- management team of the overall company must not,
at the same time, be the top- management team of any of the operating
companies, and least of all of the operating</p>
<p>company where the headquarters are located. As soon as more than a
very small fraction of a company’s business is multinational, top
management has to divorce itself from run- ning any one national or
regional component on any product area. Otherwise, it will spend all its
time on its own immediate management job and will neglect the other
businesses.</p>
<p>This, in other words, means that the traditional organization in
which top management is both the top management of the overall company
and that of its largest single—and usually the domestic—company, while
all the rest of the business is under an international division, is the
wrong structure. Wherever it persists—and it is still fairly common—it
does damage or weakens the company’s performance.</p>
<p>It was long ago proven that a central government cannot be
ambulatory. A multina- tional organization needs a headquarters.</p>
<p>The best example of a “multinational government” in Western history,
that of the gov- ernment of Charlemagne, proved this point in the ninth
century. Charlemagne’s court moved from imperial castle to imperial
castle. This was the only way in which the Em- peror could keep contact
with his representatives in the various parts of the empire. But in a
pre-monetary age, the court could also support itself only by living off
the land. This dependence on ambulatory headquarters was a major reason
why, almost immediately after Charlemagne’s death, the empire fell apart
and split up into manageable pieces; that</p>
<p>is, pieces that a ruler could govern from one place of residence. And
yet Charlemagne’s court did not even suffer from “jet fatigue,” though
“ox-cart fatigue” must have been se- vere.</p>
<p>A fixed place of business is a necessity for managing. Work requires
time, continuity and rhythm and schedule. One needs the organized,
systematic support which one can build up only over long years in one
place. Imperial chancellors can perhaps travel all the time, as can
executive vice-presidents. Market research men, accountants, personnel
peo- ple, that is, people paid to think—not to mention secretaries or
computer experts—have to stay put if they are to produce.</p>
<p>But at the same time, local decisions have to be made at the scene of
action. The local decision has to be made within the framework of
corporate strategy. But it has to be a local rather than a corporate
decision if it is to be effective. The headquarters for the local
business—and this may be European or it may be Swedish—has to be where
the decision is to be effective. It has to be made with full knowledge
of local conditions. It has to be made in cooperation with people on the
spot and in relationships with local institutions. It has to fit local
laws, local expectations, local habits. It has to be, above all,
comprehensi- ble to the people who have to carry it out, that is, to
loca1 people whose knowledge of the</p>
<p>overall company is of necessity limited. The factory manager in Spain
or the manager of the branch bank in Hong Kong achieves his results
through his local knowledge, his local contacts, local action.</p>
<p>Yet the pharmaceutical company manager in a Latin American country,
the manufac- turing manager in Ford’s engine plant in Germany, or the
Chase Bank branch manager in Frankfurt must know enough about the
objectives, strategies, and needs of the entire com- pany not to make
the wrong decisions. He must know enough not to make decisions that
optimize his own business but sub-optimize the whole company.</p>
<p>There is another important problem in top-management structure for
the multinational.</p>
<p>Top-management structures are not mechanical; they are, above all,
cultural. The top- management structure which an American management
group accepts as right and proper may appear decidedly odd and
uncomfortable to a French, a Japanese, or a German man- agement group.
Yet these French, Japanese, or German managers have to understand their
own local top-management group, have to feel comfortable with it, have
to work with it. To be successful, the top-management teams in a
multinational have therefore to be dif- ferent in their structure in
different countries, or else they will not make local sense. Yet they
have to be compatible at least throughout the company, or else various
top- management teams cannot work together.</p>
<p>discussed in more detail later in this chapter.)</p>
<p>The Individual Manager</p>
<p>Even more perplexing than top-management structure in the
multinational is the design of the individual manager’s job and of his
function.</p>
<p>The man who heads the subsidiary of a major pharmaceutical
company—whether the company be American, Swiss, Dutch, British, or
German—in, say, a medium-sized Latin American country, e.g., Colombia,
has to be a big man in his own country. He may head the largest
pharmaceutical company in his country and be one of the largest
employers, especially of educated people. With health care a major
political and governmental matter in such countries—as it should be—he
better be a man of considerable standing. Among the heads of
pharmaceutical subsidiaries in such Latin American countries are, for
in- stance, several men who were deans of the leading medical schools in
their countries be- fore they went into industry, and several who had
served as ministers of health.</p>
<p>Drugs are the one part of modern medicine which a developing country
can use effec- tively. It is easier and cheaper to obtain modern drugs
than to educate and pay physicians, build hospitals, or develop health
services in poor rural areas and in urban slums. Drugs, therefore, are
likely to play a far more important part in the health-care system of
such a country.</p>
<p>Yet in terms of sales, the country does not account for much more
than a fair-sized sales district in one of the major developed
countries, such as Kansas City in the United States or Manchester in
England. How then should the executive be structured within the overall
organization?</p>
<p>This is a problem which conventional organization theory cannot
solve. The Unilever structure described earlier comes closest to solving
it. But again, the only solution is to say that the head of the
Colombian subsidiary is both manager of a fair-sized sales district and
a member of company top management. Which of the two he is depends on
the situa- tion. In fact, it must largely be left to him to decide which
role the situation demands. He should always have immediate access to
the company’s very top. But he should rarely use it. Yet he should also
be the kind of man whom corporate top management looks to for
leadership, guidance, advice, and counsel on major policy matters, e.g.,
on relationships with governments throughout Latin America, on
long-range strategy in Latin America, and so on. He surely should not
report to a Latin American vice-president in Basel or</p>
<p>New York. He also should not have to “clear” the great bulk of his
day-to-day problems with people who are even more junior.</p>
<p>Again, only systems-management concepts, nebulous though they are,
are truly perti- nent. Ordinary organization charts are likely to
confuse rather than to clarify.</p>
<p>A Man Needs a Home</p>
<p>Equally difficult are the problems of management personnel policy, of
opportunities, status, pay.</p>
<p>The ablest man, by common consent, in the entire management group of
one of the major American-based multinationals was the head of the
Italian company, Dr. Manzoni. Manzoni had first become known to the
company as the lawyer representing the Italian owners of a medium-sized
business the American company acquired. The American president was so
impressed by him that he asked Manzoni to take over when the Italian
subsidiary ran into trouble a few years later. Manzoni restored the
Italian subsidiary to health and rapidly built it into the leading
Italian business in its industry. When the Com- mon Market came into
being, Manzoni planned and spearheaded the company’s expan- sion
throughout Western Europe, found the right acquisitions and partners,
found man- agement people for the new companies, trained and developed
them, and, to all intents and purposes, ran the European companies of
the group from his Italian headquarters. When finally replacement for
the company’s aging chief executive in the United States had to be
found, everybody at once thought of Manzoni. But Manzoni turned the job
down flat. My sons are in high school and I do not want them to become
expatriates. My wife has old parents whom she cannot leave alone. And
frankly, I myself see little that would make me feel at home in a small
Midwestern town, and few attractions there that could compare with those
of Rome. I know that I could do the job you want me to do— and the job
is a fascinating one and far more than I would ever have dared aspire to
in my wildest dreams. But, still, it is the wrong job for me.”</p>
<p>People need roots. They need a home. They have a right to be
concerned with the education of their children. They have a duty to
aging parents. And they are probably more realistic than the company’s
personnel vice-president when they argue that they are unlikely to
“transplant” well. Yet the company better find a way to put to work the
talents of a Manzoni. If (as this company did, by the way) it concludes
that the man is no longer “promotable” and relegates him to second-class
citizenship, it cuts off its nose to spite its face. Such a man will
leave—as Manzoni did within a year or two.</p>
<p>How then can one build a management structure which recognizes and
indeed respects the roots of a man and yet builds a truly multinational
team?</p>
<p>It is clear that one requirement is equal opportunity regardless of
passport. A Manzoni must have the opportunity to get to the top
according to his abilities. To deny the oppor- tunity and to reserve
senior management positions to people of a given nationality is to
deprive the multinational corporation of its ability to attract capable
people in every coun- try in which it works. Companies domiciled in
small countries, such as Holland, Switzer- land, and Sweden, confine, by
and large, senior management positions in all their subsidi- aries and
affiliates to nationals of the parent company who have been trained and
who have started their careers in the parent company. (The only
exception to this rule is the United States, where the major Dutch and
Swiss companies have, for many years, pro- moted Americans into their
top management. But the American subsidiary, of these com- panies is
usually the largest unit within the entire group and has to be managed
as a truly separate entity.) There are advantages to this—communications
obviously are much eas- ier. And some of the disadvantages which
companies domiciled in large countries, such as the United States or
Great Britain, would suffer it they followed this practice are not in-
curred by companies headquartered in smaller, neutral countries. No one
worries much about Swiss imperialism.</p>
<p>But even in these cases, the policy is clearly not in the company’s
best interest. With competition for first-rate management people
intense, good young men will not come to</p>
<p>work in a company—or will not stay—unless they have equal
opportunities. A company which, no matter what its professions, promotes
only nationals of the mother country into senior positions, in its
subsidiaries and affiliates or at home, is unlikely to obtain or to hold
the managerial resources it requires.</p>
<p>words, to make a virtue out of its being transcultural. Otherwise it
will be less attractive than a well-managed purely domestic company. Yet
a man’s national roots, national loy- alties, national culture, and his
need for a “home” must be respected.</p>
<p>How to Pay?</p>
<p>There are also serious compensation problems of the multinational
executive. Should ex- ecutives around the world be paid the same salary
in line with their position? Or should salaries fit the widely varying
local standards? Should the American or Dutchman who is sent from his
parent company into the management of a subsidiary be paid on the local
scale—which, for instance, in Japan would mean a salary far too low for
an expensive place like Tokyo—but also receive substantial “benefits,”
e.g., in the form of housing or an unlimited expense account? And what
about the man who heads what is in effect a small business within the
corporate structure—the president of a pharmaceutical subsidi- ary in
Colombia, for instance, who in terms of the size of his business is a
middle-level executive, but who in terms of his position in the country
is a top man?</p>
<p>Again, the requirements are not easily compatible. It is highly
desirable to make it possible for a man to move and not to be penalized
by a promotion. Yet if people are be- ing paid according to the
prevailing standards in the country in which they work, being promoted
very often will mean that they are being asked to take a cut in pay.</p>
<p>The most extreme cases of this are the Japanese executives who are
sent to work in the United States or in Europe. Even though what
Japanese executives in New York and Düsseldorf receive is low by
American or German standards, it is unheard of by Japanese standards.
When, after five years or so, the successful Japanese executive is
transferred back to a much bigger job at home, he often has to take a
cut of 50 percent of income or more.</p>
<p>But, to have one member of a management group, and especially a
member from abroad who is also a foreigner, paid quite differently from
the rest of the group is disrup- tive.</p>
<p>By far the most serious compensation problem arises out of the
fundamental business strategy of the multinational. For the
multinational manager needs to be both a member of the top-management
team of the whole company and of the top-management team of the unit for
which he works. Traditional compensation plans, especially plans with
big bo- nuses geared to the results of the unit which the manager
manages directly are therefore likely to be both unfair and destructive.
They penalize teamwork, just where teamwork is needed the most.</p>
<p>This can be seen in its most acute form in the multinational
commercial bank. In the teacher example, the New York bank’s
representative in Japan, who initiated the business and produced a new
and major client for the bank, had nothing to show for it in his profit
and loss statement. The London branch, which did all the work, showed in
its books only a liability. The Frankfurt branch, simply because it had
a German mark surplus available, showed all the income from the deal.
The typical bonus policy would highly reward Frankfurt, penalize London,
and leave Tokyo out altogether.</p>
<p>To tie a man’s compensation to the results of his own branch or
territory will therefore make him slight the very opportunities that
might produce the greatest results for the bank—opportunities where the
actual transaction might be done by another branch or by headquarters.
To pay him on any other basis, however, or to rely on personal and
subjec- tive judgment rather than on impersonal and objective
yardsticks, is equally undesirable. But what is desirable is by no means
clear yet—let alone how it can be achieved.</p>
<p>In almost every area throughout this book examples of successful
approaches could be given. But I have not been able to find yet a
successful and working compensation policy for managers in multinational
business. American companies profess the same frustration and confusion
as European or Japanese ones. And every compensation policy in multina-
tional corporations I know of is forever being restudied, reorganized,
revised. The most successful policy may well be that of a major Swiss
pharmaceutical company which frankly says, “We know that whatever we do
will at best take care of symptoms for a few months; but at least we try
to make our management people understand that there is no solution and
that day-to-day accommodations to the worst problems of the moment is
the best they—and we—can expect.”</p>
<p>A true multinational which completely transcends in its management
structure, in its managerial jobs, and in its personnel policies,
national and cultural boundaries is neither likely nor perhaps
desirable. What is needed is a floating balance between conflicting
needs and conflicting demands. A multinational must be able to use a
Dr. Manzoni as a member of the top management of an American-based
company and yet respect his le- gitimate desire to remain a resident in
his own country and a member of his own culture. It must be able to have
both an overall company strategy and local strategies for a given unit.
It must be able to pay for performance and yet encourage teamwork. It
must be able to be both centralized and decentralized, and to know when
to be one or the other.</p>
<p>The requires a great deal of formal structure and policy. But it
requires, even more, a great deal of mutual knowledge, mutual trust, and
shared experience. Above all, it re- quires tremendous self-discipline
throughout the entire managerial group.</p>
<p>The Multinational and Its Environment</p>
<p>Practically every argument against the multinational corporation
advanced in any country is by itself a fallacy. It can be disproved
easily. And yet the disproof is not going to con- vince the critics and
enemies of multinationalism. They may be using the wrong argu- ments.
But their hostility is directed toward a reality. They are formulating
the problem wrongly. But there is a real problem.</p>
<p>In its host countries, even highly developed ones with substantial
economic strength of their own, the multinational is attacked as being
impervious to the country’s economic, social, and financial policies,
and as undermining the country’s sovereignty and its gov- ernment. It is
attacked as having a power of decision over what will be produced, over
jobs, over industrial and economic policy, which is illegitimate and
beyond proper con- trol. Decisions, rather than rest in the country’s
legitimate authority, such as its parliament or government, are
exercised in a shadowy and indefinable way, someplace far away, by
faceless men who neither know the country nor care for it.</p>
<p>But in the multinational’s home country it is also attacked—and in
strong countries, including the United States, as well as in weak ones.
Here too, the multinational is seen as a means to evade, if not to
subvert, political authority and of creating a superpower, not
accountable to anyone and yet in control of economic policy, of jobs,
and even, to a large extent, of policies in non-economic areas. The
American-based multinational is accused in the United States of
“exporting jobs” but also of using its subsidiaries abroad to evade U.S.
policies such as the former ban on trading with Red China. And it has
been attacked with equal bitterness in host countries abroad because the
subsidiaries in these countries, by not being willing to trade with Red
China, defied and subverted the host country’s, e.g., Canada’s or
Sweden’s, own policies in international affairs.</p>
<p>The counterargument of the multinational companies is a perfectly
valid one. No busi- ness, no matter how rich and big it may be, has any
power against a national government. In any clash between economic and
political power, at least in this century, economic power has come out a
very poor second. The multinational exists, like any business, at the
sufferance of national government.</p>
<p>But this argument does not go to the heart of the matter. The real
problem is that the multinational by its very nature must look upon the
economy in non-national terms. It</p>
<p>This is the true difference between the twentieth-century
multinational and its prede- cessors before World War I.</p>
<p>It is the function of the multinational in a common world market to
allocate produc- tion and markets according to economic logic; that is,
to optimize production and distri- bution across very large areas, if
not the entire world. But “production and distribution” is simply
another term for jobs, for imports and exports, that is, for balances of
trade and balances of payment, for wage levels—and altogether for
economic conditions and eco- nomic policies.</p>
<p>It is simply not true that the economic optimization of the
multinational “exports jobs.” Every study has shown that it creates
jobs. The goods its subsidiaries abroad pro- duce and market would not
otherwise have been made in, and bought from, the multina- tional’s home
country. But the subsidiary buys equipment and supplies from the
multina- tional’s home country. Indeed the multinational, by moving
production to people, may be a major force in preventing dislocation and
turbulence. The alternative—large-scale mi- gration of low-skill and
low-income peoples—whether Blacks into Harlem, Algerians into France,
Turks into Germany, sharecroppers from Brazil’s Northeast into São
Paulo, or Sicilians into Torino—creates, we now know, unbearable
tensions. The economist— almost any economist—would therefore conclude
that all the criticism of, and resistance to, the multinational, is
misinformed.</p>
<p>But this misses the point. The multinational is a problem precisely
because its deci- sions are based on economic rationality and divorced
from political sovereignty.</p>
<p>There is no solution. The multinational is a political problem not
because of anything it does or does not do. It is a problem because
political sovereignty and economic reality no longer coincide. It does
the multinational no good to protest that it and each of its sub-
sidiaries are “good corporate citizens” of the country in which each
operates. Of course, it and each of its subsidiaries observe the laws—at
least to the same extent to which the country’s nationals observe it.
But if the phrase is meant to imply—as it usually does— that the
multinational in every country in which it operates thinks and acts in
terms of that country’s national economy and market, it is nonsense. To
do so would deny the whole logic of the multinational corporation, which
is to optimize resources within the world market reality.</p>
<p>But to reassert against the multinational the reality of national
sovereignty is also fu- tile. This is what De Gaulle tried to do. The
only result was a rapid decline in the com- petitive position of the
French economy in the world. It is no accident that the French have
become the strongest advocates of the proposed law for a “European
transnational company.”</p>
<p>There is indeed a real need for new international law to come to
grips with this ten- sion.* Such law will not only have to define under
what conditions countries accept multi- nationals and what limitations
they may impose on ownership, on remittance of profits and repayments of
capital, and on freedom of movement of goods, people, and capital from
one subsidiary of a multinational to another.</p>
<p>It will, above all, have to “depoliticize” the multinational. Insofar
as this means that the multinational will be forbidden to try to use the
political strength of its home govern- ment for its own ends, beyond
what it is entitled to under the new international law, this should
present relatively little problem. As far as relations between developed
countries are involved, such use of political power for corporate ends
has long ceased to be feasi- ble. And as far as relations between the
developed and economically strong home country</p>
<p>*As has been argued for many years and with great cogency by Jack N.
Behrman, former Assistant Secretary of Commerce of the U.S. under
President Kennedy, and now Professor of Intemational Economics at the
Univer- sity of North Carolina.</p>
<p>of a multinational and an economically weak developing country are
concerned, it is by now abundantly clear that “multinational
imperialism” is futile.</p>
<p>After the electoral victory of the Left in Chile in 1970, an officer
of ITT suggested to the Nixon Administration that it foment economic and
political chaos in Chile to prevent the inauguration of a Marxist
president and to save ITT’s Chilean telephone company from
expropriation. The officer only ensured that the Nixon
Administration—despite its hostility to the new Chilean government—would
do nothing and remain scrupulously un- involved. Still the Chileans
seized upon this to attack all foreign business, and business
altogether.</p>
<p>Any future international law regarding the multinational must outlaw
any action of this</p>
<p>kind. In whatever country it operates, the subsidiary or affiliate of
a multinational is clearly entitled to no more political support from
its home government than a private citi- zen.</p>
<p>Far more difficult will be the legal resolution of the question of
preference given by governments to their own national businesses. To
what extent should it be permitted? To what extent, for instance, should
the universal practice of giving limited or absolute pref- erences to
national producers in public works or government purchases be legalized?
And who is a national producer in the age of the multinationals?</p>
<p>In the example cited earlier of the British government ruling to have
British govern- ment departments give preference in buying computers to
British-owned ICL, “national” was defined by ownership. British
Honeywell’s protest against the ruling, in effect, asked that
nationality be defined by the number and location of jobs. Both
companies are, of course, British in terms of their incorporation and
location. And with respect to many other products even the British
government accepts the logic of the Honeywell argument.</p>
<p>The thorniest issue is that of the reach of the home country’s
jurisdiction. It is also the one which the U.S. will find the most
difficult.</p>
<p>Traditional U.S. legal—or at least governmental—doctrine has held
that any subsidi- ary or affiliate of an American company abroad is
subject to American jurisdiction, with respect to antitrust, for
instance, but also with respect to restrictions on trade with certain
countries. But American anti-trust ideas are by no means universally
accepted as sound or even as moral. Compulsory cartels, for instance,
are in most continental countries (and in Japan) considered normal
instruments of economic policy. And competition is seen as more of a
vice than a virtue.</p>
<p>Resolving these problems by a common code of behavior is the only way
to make the multinational what it should and could be: a powerful
instrument for economic strength and political harmony. The problems are
largely political and legal. But they are problems which it is the
duty—and the opportunity—of top management in the multinationals to
think through. Otherwise, it is safe to predict, political solutions
will be imposed on the multinationals which can only damage them and the
world economy. Few of the multina- tionals even seem to be aware of the
task. They seem to assume that the problems will go away if only no one
talks about them—which is neither intelligent nor responsible.</p>
<p>The Multinationals and the Developing Countries</p>
<p>Some 80 percent of multinational investment and business—after taking
out as not truly multinational the plantation and extractive industries
(such as crude oil production or iron-ore mining)—is in developed
countries. And so is some 80 percent of world trade, again subtracting
agricultural products and raw materials.</p>
<p>But both the greatest contributions and the greatest problems of
multinationalism lie in the developing countries.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there are few things a developing country needs as
much as the mul- tinational corporation. There are few contributions
from which it can benefit so much as from those only the multinational
corporation can make. A developing country needs capital. It needs
access to technology even more. It needs access to markets for whatever
goods its one surplus resource—labor—can produce.</p>
<p>The greatest contribution the American multinationals have made to
countries like Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, has been neither
capital nor technology. It has not even been entrepreneurial and
managerial skill—these countries, being ethnically Chi- nese, have
adequate supplies of both. It was a guaranteed market in the U.S. for
the tex- tiles, the Christmas ornaments, and the radio sets which these
countries manufacture.</p>
<p>Most of all, a developing country needs a way to acquire
skills—industrial skills, managerial skills, entrepreneurial skills. And
no other institution has so far proven capa- ble of providing the
transfer of skills, on which rest all hopes for the economic and social
development of a developing country.</p>
<p>But at the same time, a developing country, almost by definition, has
a balance of payments problem. The more capital it imports, the more
foreign exchange will it have to produce to service the capital. Even
more important, a developing country, almost by definition, has a severe
problem of national identity. It may be—and usually is— “nation- alist.”
But it rarely has a tradition of nationhood. And the multinational
company in which a country’s ablest, or at least its most affluent,
people are subordinate to “bosses” else- where—in London or New York,
Rotterdam or Tokyo—creates a problem of national loyalty and allegiance,
at least in the minds of people who are desperately struggling to define
their own national identity. It also creates a “brain drain”—the ablest
people go to work for a foreign employer. This creates a feeling of
dependence, if not of helpless im- potence, in the face of
concentrations of economic power compared to which a poor coun- try
looks puny indeed.</p>
<p>It is not just paranoia that makes a Peruvian or, for that matter, an
Indian minister feel that a big multinational, domiciled elsewhere in a
developed country, is a threat. He knows perfectly well that no matter
how important the company’s subsidiary may be to his own national
economy, it matters little to the treasurer of the multinational at
head- quarters. For Peru or India, a given subsidiary of a
multinational—the pharmaceutical subsidiary of an American company in
Peru or Hindustani Lever in India—may be a giant on which the national
economy heavily depends. But it produces at best a small percent of the
total revenue of the pharmaceutical multinational or of Unilever. In its
decisions, the central management of the multinational cannot possibly
subordinate the interest of the total company to the interests of Peru
or India. It may not willfully do damage—indeed there is no reason why
it should. But it must treat as trivial the very concerns which are
central and essential to the Peruvian or to the Indian cabinet minister
or politician.</p>
<p>And then the very qualities which make it an economic asset to the
developing country also make it a powerful competitor to the local
entrepreneur, the local business establish- ment. Both in Brazil and in
India, the local businessmen, while themselves deeply en- gaged in joint
ventures with multinationals based in Europe and in the United States,
have also been most vocal in their demand for “protection” from the
multinational, for majority ownership, or at least controlling ownership
to be in the hands of local investors, or for closing whole sectors of
the economy to the multinationals.</p>
<p>The ambivalence of the developing countries was shown dramatically by
the very dif- ferent reaction of the countries along the north and west
coasts of South America to the so-called Andean Pact which proposes, in
effect, that multinationals be strictly limited, and confined to narrow
sectors of the economy and to minority holdings.</p>
<p>Chile and Peru demanded even more stringent provisions which, in
effect, would have banished the multinationals within ten or fifteen
years. Colombia signed the pact—but with severe reservations and indeed
with the clear and declared intention of not carrying it out. Venezuela
long refused to sign at all.</p>
<p>The reason for these differences in attitude is not ideology—the
Venezuelan govern- ment was more leftist than was the Chilean at the
time (around 1968) the pact was drafted. The reason is that each country
has different multinationals. In Chile and Peru the foreign company was
still nineteenth century, as a rule: extractive industries such as
copper min- ing and petroleum, and “infrastructure” utilities such as
power and light, and telephone companies. In both countries foreigners
largely manage these businesses, and local busi- nessmen are kept out of
both management and ownership. In Colombia, the multinational</p>
<p>did not make its appearance until after World War II. It is active
mostly in manufacturing, both for the home market and for export. The
Colombia subsidiaries of the multinationals are, almost without
exception, managed by Colombians. And many are partnerships with
Colombian entrepreneurs. Venezuela, finally, eagerly wants multinational
manufacturing companies to offset its industrial oligarchy—the few
families who, as local representa- tives and confidants of the big
international petroleum companies, have come to dominate whatever
industry there is in the country. Venezuela—in part because of its oi1
reve- nues—has a large number of highly trained young men who find
opportunities seriously limited in the family-run companies of the
country and who, highly nationalist though they are, would welcome the
coming of the foreign multinationals with their career oppor- tunities
for the able man regardless of family background.</p>
<p>These examples show that it is up to the multinational and its top
management to structure the right relationship with a developing
country. The tension cannot be elimi- nated. But it can be assuaged.</p>
<p>An intelligent multinational management will, for instance, refrain
from going into businesses that will, inevitably, become a burden on the
slender foreign-exchange re- sources of a developing country or into
businesses that cannot exist unless so heavily pro- tected as to become
a burden on the country’s consuming masses.</p>
<p>It is clearly undesirable to build a manufacturing facility where the
costs—of raw ma- terials, of labor, or of capital—are so high as to make
economic operations highly prob- lematical. It is foolish to depend on
promises of governmental protection in such a case.</p>
<p>Many companies have built manufacturing plants in the smaller Latin
American coun- tries despite high factorial disadvantages and based on
promises of government protection alone. These governments, in the 1950s
and 1960s, were willing to promise almost any- thing to obtain “import
substitution.” By now most of these companies have learned that they
made a mistake. They may show the profits which a prohibitive taritf
guarantees them, but they cannot remit them. For this would damage the
country’s precarious balance of payments. A plant which can be justified
only with import substitution makes the coun- try, as a rule, actually
more import-dependent—on raw materials or on machinery. At the same time
it creates a demand for foreign exchange to service the capital
investment without creating the exports to produce the foriegn exchange.
Furthermore these compa- nies stand in danger of seeing their investment
wiped out should there be any move to- ward economic integration such as
the proposed Latin American free trade area.</p>
<p>Any investment made anywhere should be capable of survival in a
competitive mar- ket. If there is little reason to hope that within a
few years a new plant or a new business will gain competitive strength,
at least adequate to survival without protection, it should not be
started in the first place.</p>
<p>This, of course, has been known since the first protectionist theory
was developed—in the early decades of the nineteenth century, by Henry
Clay in the United States, and by his disciple, Friedrich List, in
Germany. “Infant indusiries” may need protection, may indeed deserve it.
But the purpose of such protection is to enable them to grow into
“adults” who can stand on their own feet. If that is not accomplished,
the industry will sooner or later be in trouble, no matter how great the
protectionist subsidy.</p>
<p>It can also be said that the traditional nineteenth-century pattern
of the wholly-owned subsidiary does not fit the developing countries. It
discourages rather than encourages what the country needs the most:
native investment and capital formation, and native managers and
entrepreneurs. Yet the local subsidiary must be capable of being part of
an integrated worldwide economic and business strategy. It must be
capable, for example, of specializing in making one major component for
the multinational’s plants and markets everywhere but of importing, from
the other plants of the multinational, whatever compo- nents it is not
suited to make.</p>
<p>Ford’s Mexican subsidiary, as mentioned before, specializes in making
electrical as- semblies for the Pinto. But it probably should not make
engines at all but get them from Ford’s Canadian, German, or English
plants.</p>
<p>But this then raises the very difficult problem of harmonizing the
interests of the local partners—let alone those of the local
governments—and those of the multinational sys- tem. Who makes the
optimization decisions?</p>
<p>In many developing countries the traditional congruence of capital
investment and management control needs to be re-examined. Some
developing countries can—and should—generate their own capital. Brazil
is one example. But so are, to a large extent, the Chinese territories
of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. What they need is technol- ogy,
management, and access to markets. Here management contracts rather than
owner- ship of subsidiaries may be needed.</p>
<p>Other developing countries need the capital as well but need also
either provision for eventual participation in ownership by nationals
or, from the beginning, financing other than investment by the
multinational. Otherwise the relationship will become unbearable when
the country develops.</p>
<p>The key case is, of course, Canada. That Canadian industry is so
heavily owned by foreign, and especially by U.S. companies, is the
result of Canadian decisions and actions, and especially of the
deliberate policy of the Liberal governments of Canada in the thirty
years after the Great Depression of the thirties, to channel Canadian
capital into “infra- structure” investments such as public works and
leave industrial investment to the for- eigner. The result, in economic
terms, has been a brilliant success. Canada which, in 1930, was a poor
and largely pre-industrial economy is by now one of the world’s most
highly developed and wealthiest economies. Politically the result has,
however, been un- desirable. A major economic power, which is what
Canada has become, cannot be “owned” abroad.</p>
<p>The only large company that has understood this is the American
Telephone Com- pany. At the end of World War II it owned practically all
of the two telephone companies in Canada’s most populous provinces,
Ontario and Quebec. Then it began systematically to divest itself of
share ownership to the point where these companies are now almost
entirely Canadian-owned. Yet, technically and in terms of operations,
they have remairied members of the Bell System.</p>
<p>Finally, the multinational needs to think ahead and solve the
problems which its own success will create in a developing country. As a
result of such success the country will no longer be a developing
country but, like Canada, become a developed one. At the least it will
change to the point where the old relationship becomes untenable.</p>
<p>The petroleum concession becomes untenable as it succeeds. For this
first means that a formerly dirt-poor country becomes oil-rich. It means
also that nomadic Bedouins be- come skilled mechanics, geologists, and
chemical engineers. The concession made sense in the beginning, if only
because of the enormous costs and high risks of exploration. The
petroleum-producing country still needs tbe international oil
company—perhaps more than ever. For it needs a complex and highly
expensive transportation and marketing sys- tem worldwide. But the
concession as a relationship has outlived its usefulness and be- comes a
millstone around the neck of both producing country and oil company.</p>
<p>That not one international petroleum company, at least to public
knowledge, faced up to the problem and thought through a new
relationship is a severe indictment of top man- agement.</p>
<p>The Multinational Tomorrow</p>
<p>One thing is clear: the multinational tomorrow will be different from
the multinational of today.</p>
<p>We still, substantially, have the nineteenth-century multinational
but use it to do the twentieth-century task of the transnational. We
are, in other , words in a transition period.</p>
<p>About the relationship between the multinational and political
environment, it is easier to say what will not work than what will.</p>
<p>Seen in this perspective, the Japanese policy has been realistic
despite its obvious pa- rochialism and despite the fact that it is based
on fear of the outsider, and on aversion to him rather than on any
conscious and systematic thought regarding Japan’s position in the world
economy. Japan’s policy has attempted to obtain the benefits of economic
integra- tion without the resultant dependence on, let alone domination
by, outside business. It has attempted to find new forms of integration,
e.g., the joint venture and the technical part- nership, without
relinquishing ultimate decision-making power.</p>
<p>But the Japanese policy is still focused on nineteenth-century
realities rather than on those of today. It also, for this reason, is no
longer adequate, even though in many impor- tant respects, it may more
closely foreshadow the structures of tomorrow than the mono- lithic
company, owned, controlled, and directed throughout the entire economic
world from one decision-making center.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Also untenable is the nineteenth-century pattern of foreign
domination and control of the infrastructure businesses, such as
electric power, transportation, and telephone. One reason is that the
foreigner cannot afford these investments in an inflation-prone world.
These are capital-intensive businesses. Yet they are also politically
very sensitive busi- nesses, the prices of which are everywhere under
government control. In an inflation, a foreign company will not be
allowed to raise telephone rates—only a government can get away with
this. And in an inflation a foreign company cannot raise the capital to
maintain, let alone expand, service—only a government with the power of
taxation can do this.</p></li>
<li><p>A position such as IBM has in the world’s computer industry is
not a tenable one and goes beyond the limits that will be allowed to any
one multinational company. IBM has a near-monopoly on the vital new
social function of information technology. The IBM dominance may be
overcome gradually as other businesses in the computer and informa- tion
industry grow more rapidly than IBM. This would be the most desirable
solution. Or governments in other areas, such as Western Europe and
Japan, may succeed in their at- tempts to organize their own effective
competitors to IBM. Finally, IBM may be deprived of its dominant
position by governmental fiat.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There might even be a totally new way to resolve the IBM problem. IBM
might be- come the first truly transnational public utility. It might
continue as a company enjoying worldwide leadership, if not
near-monopoly position, and yet be anchored in the eco- nomic and even
political structure of the host countries, through partnership with
local governments, local part ownership, and local regulation.</p>
<p>But one way or another the IBM dominance on a key necessity of modern
socieiy will be curbed.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Finally, multinationals will not be permitted to operate in
developing countries without thinking through the consequences of their
success as developers of the local economy and without planning ahead
for the change in the relationship that is mutually desirable.</li>
</ol>
<p>But as to what will be, one can only say that top management has the
responsibility to develop the relationships that will work—and
especially the relationships with developing countries.</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s Management Structures</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s management structure of the multinational will also be
different from to- day’s. Even within the developed countries the
multinational will have to be able to har- monize, in one structure, the
need for “polycentric” management with the need for a common business
strategy. One reason for this is the need to have the necessary
corporate flexibility to exploit whatever capital markets are most
advantageous in the form pre- ferred by each capital market.</p>
<p>The American-based multinational is already heavily owned by
Europeans. But the European investor has long preferred a convertible
debenture to outright equity invest- ment. As a result, up to 20 percent
of the equity capital of large American-based multina- tionals is
already in the form of convertible debenture, often in European
currencies and owned mainly by European institutions and investors.</p>
<p>But this might mean also the creation of European subsidiaries and
affiliated compa- nies with direct European stock ownership, of a
similar Brazilian subsidiary and affiliated companies with shares in the
hands of Brazilians, of joint ventures and similar partly owned
partnerships in Japan and other places, and so on. Organizationally what
is re- quired—and evolving—is systems management.</p>
<p>The multinational cannot hope to solve its internal problems or the
problems of its re- lationship to its political environment unless it
organizes itself as a highly disciplined, centrally directed, but
flexible, federation of equals. This is the only way in which the
president of the Colombian subsidiary of the worldwide pharmaceutical
company can be both top management and a regional sales manager. It is
the only way in which he can operate in two different roles according to
the logic and the needs of different situations. It is the only way in
which the multinational can adopt and turn to its own advantage very
different forms of relationships with different hosts and environments:
joint ventures here; partnerships there; ownership of substantial
minorities in regional or local subsidiaries by local investors;
partnership with governments in the many countries where government
enterprises are important and indeed central factors in the economy;
management con- tracts rather than ownership in certain developing
countries, and many others.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is equally clear that the multinational company
needs to be struc- tured so as to be able to manage common resources for
one world common market. One such resource is capital. Another one is
knowledge. The most important and most difficult one is managers and
professionals. Unless managers and professionals can be both “full
citizens” within the overall company and important leading members of
their own com- munities, the multinational companies will not be able to
attract and hold the kind o£ peo- ple they need. They will fail to
capitalize on what is their greatest asset: the desire of the young to
be part of a bigger world, to travel and to live in different cultures,
and to have a wide range of choices. The multinational company offers
this in a way yesterday’s domes- tic company could never do. At the same
time, it must be able to offer to the same young people, and especially
to the able young people in the developing countries, the opportu- nity
to make a contribution to their own country, their own society, their
own economy.</p>
<p>It is also reasonably clear that tomorrow’s multinational company
will have to be able to embrace within one and the same corporate
framework, and within one and the same management group, different
managerial traditions. In Japan it will have to be able to make
productive the Japanese traditions of structure, of promotion, of
management. But in Germany it will have to be a German company. It will
not only have to build its top management the way Germans expect their
top managements to be built—that is, as a team under a presiding
officer—it will also have to satisfy German notions of the proper
qualifications for management, for instance, the German valuation of an
engineering ca- reer as a preeminent preparation for top management (a
valuation which no other country shares, at least not to anything like
the same extent). In France, whether it approves of it or not, it will
have to be able to accept the French emphasis on the graduate of the
Grandes Écoles, such as the École Polytechnique, as an elite corps, and
even the French tradition under which a polytechnicien starts his career
in government service—in which he usually does not use the technical
education he has received—then around age forty- five or fifty, when at
the top of the government ladder, switches directly into the top man-
agement of major business enterprise. And in America—as most
multinational Europeans operating in this country learned long ago—top
management will have to bear the Ameri- can top-management stamp.</p>
<p>But at the same time the multinational company will have to be
unified. Its manage- ment people, even in middle management, will have
to be able to understand these differ- ences, will have to be willing to
accept them, will have to learn to respect them. Where</p>
<p>today the tendency in most multinationals is to say, “This is how we
do it in Chicago (or Munich, or Osaka, or Eindhoven),” they will have to
learn tomorrow to say, “This is what we want to achieve; how does one
get it done in Peoria (or Munich, or Osaka, or Amster- dam)?”</p>
<p>The multinational of tomorrow will inevitably have to have more than
one manage- ment team. Its corporate top management will be such a team.
But at the same time, it will be a member of a great many other
top-management teams. And in the other top manage- ments, somebody who
is not necessarily corporate top management will have to be the team
leader.</p>
<p>CPC, the American-based company already mentioned, is a first
example. Corporate top management is a team of about four or five
people. But it is also a member of top management of each of its five
companies. The president of each of these companies is the presiding
officer for the top-management team of his company, of which his own
cor- porate top management are members. They can, of course, replace
him. They certainly make the decision whom to appoint into the
presidency of each of the five companies. But with respect to his own
area, he “sits at the head of the table.” Each president, and espe-
cially the presidents of the European, Latin American, and Far Eastern
companies which preside over a large number of autonomous companies in
different countries, is in turn a member of the top-management team of
each of these companies, with the head of that company “in the
chair.”</p>
<p>This is a complex and difficult structure. It requires not only that
corporate top man- agement free itself from all operating
responsibility. It requires that management think through clearly what
its business—or businesses are and should be. It requires manage- ment
by objectives and self-control. It requires that conscience functions
are organized and made effective. It requires the highest degree of
self-discipline on the part of manag- ers and willingness to take upward
responsibility to keep higher management, and espe- cially the corporate
top management, informed, knowledgeable, and educated. It also re-
quires the “executive secretariat” or “business research staff” (Chapter
51).</p>
<p>And there is need for highly effective boards of directors, both for
the overall com- pany and for major parts, and functioning both as
review and control boards and as public and community-relations boards
(see Chapter 52).</p>
<p>But multinational management, like all systems management, also
demands personal contact, vigorous efforts on the top to create and to
maintain communications, and will- ingness both to learn and to teach.
It cannot be run by “systems,” though it requires a high degree of it.
Like its prototype in the NASA “systems management” (Chapter 47), top
management in such a structure has to be free to spend time with people,
and not only with the top people. It has to make sure that every
decision maker in the structure knows what goes on and not only within
his own unit. It has to make sure that people pretty far down the line
understand and that they in turn help top management understand. This
requires that the people in New York or in Basel have enough time to sit
down with their associates in São Paulo or Sydney—not with a problem,
not with their own concerns, but as learners, as listeners, as resource.
It similarly requires that the top-management people, the members of the
corporate top-management team as well as the members of all other
top-management teams down to the smallest local company, have time for
direct personal relationships with important groups in their
environment: the government people, the po- litical leadership, the
opinion-makers, whether in the communications media or in the
universities. They cannot hope to reconcile the cleavage between the
reality of a world economy and the reality of national sovereign states.
But it is their job to make it bear- able.</p>
<p>The multinational company is surely the most important economic
instrument in to- day’s world. It is important precisely because it
reflects the new reality of a world market and of a world economy. It is
important because it is the most effective tool for optimiz- ing the
economic resources available. But precisely because it reflects a new
reality rather than the extension of yesterday’s business, it also
requires new structures, new methods of integration, and new
relationships. The multinational company is still new enough to be</p>
<p>crippled. If so, the world would be the poorer. And the greatest
sufferers would be pre- cisely those developing countries which are, at
the same time, most afraid of the multina- tional company, most
conscious of the disparity between its strength and their own weak-
ness, most in need of psychological, but also of economic, security and
identity. But to make the multinational corporation live up to its
promise requires innovative work of high quality from its top
managements.</p>
