<p>The Ethics of Responsibility</p>
<p>The Ethics of Businessmen: The Wrong Question?—Leadership Groups but
Not Leaders—What Being a Professional Means—An Ethic of
Responsibility—Primum non nocere—Social Responsibility vs. “Club
Membership”—Executive Compensation and Income Inequality—The “Golden
Fetters”—The Rhetoric of the Profit Motive— Private Function and Public
Character</p>
<p>Csr .of the businessman. Most have nothing to do with business
and</p>
<p>One main topic is plain, everyday, honesty. Businessmen, we are told
solemnly, should not cheat, steal, lie, bribe, or take bribes. But nor
should anyone else. Men and women do not acquire exemption from ordinary
rules of personal behavior because of their work or job. Nor, however,
do they cease to be human beings when appointed vice- president, city
manager, or college dean. And there has always been a number of people
who cheat, steal, lie, bribe, or take bribes. The problem is one of
moral values and moral education, of the individual, of the family, of
the school. But there neither is a separate ethics of business, nor is
one needed.</p>
<p>All that is needed is to mete out stiff punishments to those—whether
business execu- tives or others—who yield to temptation. In England a
magistrate still tends to hand down a harsher punishment in a
drunken-driving case if the accused has gone to one of the well- known
public schools or to Oxford or Cambridge. And the conviction still
.rates a head- line in the evening paper: “Eton graduate convicted of
drunken driving.” No one expects an Eton education to produce temperance
leaders. But it is still a badge of distinction, if not of privilege.
And not to treat a wearer of such a badge more harshly than an ordinary
workingman who has had one too many would offend the community’s sense
of justice. But no one considers this a problem of the “ethics of the
Eton graduate.” The other com- mon theme in the discussion of ethics in
business has nothing to do with ethics.</p>
<p>Such things as the employment of call girls to entertain customers
are not matters of ethics but matters of esthetics. “Do I want to see a
pimp when I look at myself in the mir- ror while shaving?” is the real
question.</p>
<p>It would indeed be nice to have fastidious leaders. Alas,
fastidiousness has never been prevalent among leadership groups, whether
kings and counts, priests or generals, or even “intellectuals” such as
the painters and humanists of the Renaissance, or the “literati” of the
Chinese tradition. All a fastidious man can do is withdraw personally
from activities that violate his self-respect and his sense of
taste.</p>
<p>Lately these old sermon topics have been joined, especially in the
U.S., by a third one: managers, we are being told, have an “ethical
responsibility” to take an active and con-</p>
<p>structive role in their community, to serve community causes, give of
their time to com- munity activities, and so on. There are many
countries where such community activity does not fit the traditional
mores; Japan and France would be examples. But where the community has a
tradition of “voluntarism”—that is, especially in the U.S.—managers
should indeed be encouraged to participate and to take responsible
leadership in commu- nity affairs and community organizations. Such
activities should, however, never be forced on them nor should they be
appraised, rewarded, or promoted according to their participation in
voluntary activities. Ordering or pressuring managers into such work is
abuse of organizational power and illegitimate.</p>
<p>An exception might be made for managers in businesses where the
community activi- ties are really part of their obligation to the
business. The local manager of the telephone company, for instance, who
takes part in community activities, does so as part of his managerial
duties and as the local public-relations representative of his company.
The same is true of the manager of a local Sears, Roebuck store. And the
local real estate man who belongs to a dozen different community
activities and eats lunch every day with a different “service club”
knows perfectly well that he is not serving the community but promoting
his business and hunting for prospective customers.</p>
<p>But, while desirable, community participation of managers has nothing
to do with eth- ics, and not much to do with responsibility. It is the
contribution of an individual in his capacity as a neighbor and citizen.
And it is something that lies outside his job and out- side his
managerial responsibility.</p>
<p>Leadership Groups but Not Leaders</p>
<p>A problem of ethics that is peculiar to the manager arises from the
fact that the managers of institutions are collectively the leadership
groups of the society of organizations. But individually a manager is
just another fellow employee.</p>
<p>This is clearly recognized by the public. Even the most powerful head
of the largest corporation is unknown to the public. Indeed most of the
company’s employees barely know his name and would not recognize his
face. He may owe his position entirely to personal merit and proven
performance. But he owes his authority and standing entirely to his
institution. Everybody knows GE, the Telephone Company, Mitsubishi,
Siemens, and Unilever. But who heads these great corporations—or for
that matter, the University of California, the École Polytechnique or
Guy’s Hospital in London—is of direct interest and concern primarily to
the management group within these institutions.</p>
<p>It is therefore inappropriate to speak of managers as leaders. They
are “members of the leadership group.” The group, however, does occupy a
position of visibility, of prominence, and of authority. It therefore
has responsibility—and it is with this responsi- bility that the
preceding chapters of this section are concerned.</p>
<p>But what are the responsibilities, what are the ethics of the
individual manager, as a member of the leadership group?</p>
<p>Essentially being a member of a leadership group is what
traditionally has been meant by the term “professional.” Membership in
such a group confers status, position, promi- nence, and authority. It
also confers duties. To expect every manager to be a leader is futile.
There are, in a developed society, thousands, if not millions, of
managers—and leadership is always the rare exception and confined to a
very few individuals. But as a member of a leadership group a manager
stands under the demands of professional eth- ics—the demands of an
ethic of responsibility.</p>
<p>Primum Non Nocere</p>
<p>The first responsibility of a professional was spelled out clearly,
2,500 years ago, in the Hipprocratic oath of the Greek physician: primum
non nocere—”Above all, not know- ingly, to do harm.”</p>
<p>No professional, be he doctor, lawyer, or manager, can promise that
he will indeed do good for his client. All he can do is try. But he can
promise that he will not knowingly do</p>
<p>harm. And the client, in turn, must be able to trust the professional
not knowingly to do him harm. Otherwise he cannot trust him at all. The
professional has to have autonomy. He cannot be controlled, supervised,
or directed by the client. He has to be private in that his knowledge
and his judgment have to be entrusted with the decision. But it is the
foun- dation of his autonomy, and indeed its rationale, that he see
himself as “affected with the public interest.” A professional, in other
words, is private in the sense that he is autono- mous and not subject
to political or ideological control. But he is public in the sense that
the welfare of his client sets limits to his deeds and words. And Primum
non nocere, “not knowingly to do harm,” is the basic rule of
professional ethics, the basic rule of an ethics of public
responsibility.</p>
<p>There are important areas where managers, and especially business
managers, still do not realize that in order to be permitted to remain
autonomous and private they have to impose on themselves the
responsibility of the professional ethic. They still have to learn that
it is their job to scrutinize their deeds, words, and behavior to make
sure that they do not knowingly do harm.</p>
<p>One, perhaps the most important one, of these areas has already been
discussed (in Chapter 25). The manager who fails to think through and
work for the appropriate solu- tion to an impact of his business because
it makes him “unpopular in the club” knowingly does harm. He knowingly
abets a cancerous growth. That this is stupid has been said. That this
always in the end hurts the business or the industry more than a little
temporary “unpleasantness” would have hurt has been said too. But it is
also gross violation of pro- fessional ethics.</p>
<p>But there are other areas as well. American managers, in particular,
tend to violate the rule not knowingly to do harm with respect to:</p>
<p>• executive compensation;</p>
<p>• the use of benefit plans to impose “golden fetters” on people in
the com- pany’s employ; and</p>
<p>• in their profit rhetoric.</p>
<p>Their actions and their words in these areas tend to cause social
disruption. They tend to conceal healthy reality and to create disease,
or at least social hypochondria. They tend to misdirect and to prevent
understanding. And this is grievous social harm.</p>
<p>Executive Compensation and Economic Inequality</p>
<p>Contrary to widespread belief, incomes have become far more equal in
all developed countries than in any society of which we have a record.
And they have tended to become steadily more equal as national and
personal incomes increase. And, equally contrary to popular rhetoric,
income equality is greatest in the United States.</p>
<p>The most reliable measure of income equality is the so-called Gini
co-efficient in which an index of zero stands for complete equality of
income and an index of 1 for total inequality in which one person in the
population receives all the income. The lower the Gini co-efficient, the
closer a society is to income equality. In the U.S. the Gini in the
early 1970s stood around 0.35—with about the same figure in Canada,
Australia, and Great Britain and probably also in Japan. West Germany
and the Netherlands are about 0.40. France and Sweden are around
0.50.*</p>
<p>Specifically, in the typical American business the inequality of
income between the lowest-paid people and the people in charge—that is,
between the machine operator and the manager of a large plant—is at most
one to four, if taxes are taken into account. The take-home pay of the
machine operator after taxes in 1970 was around ,500 a year; the
after-tax income of very few plant managers was larger than 5,000, all
bonuses in-</p>
<p>*On this see the article by Sanford Rose, “The Truth about Income and
Equality in the U.S.” in Fortune, De- cember, 1972.</p>
<p>cluded. If fringes are taken into account, the ratio is even lower,
i.e., one to three (or 2,000 to 5,000 maximum). And similar ratios
prevail in other developed countries, e.g., in Japan. This, it should be
said, is far greater income equality than in any communist country for
the simple reason that the economic level of a communist country is
lower.</p>
<p>In Soviet Russia, where there are practically no income taxes, the
income differential between industrial worker and plant manager runs
around 1 to 7, without taking into ac- count the non-cash benefits of
the Russian manager. And Russian managers operate at an extreme of
profit maximization; their profit-based bonus system of compensation so
di- rects them. In China, the differential between workers and plant
managers seems to run around 1 to 6 or so.</p>
<p>Whether the degree of inequality of incomes that actually prevails in
the U.S. econ- omy is “too high” or “too low” is a matter of opinion.
But clearly it is much lower than the great majority of the American
public accepts or even considers desirable. Every sur- vey shows that an
“income ratio of 1 to 10 or 12” between the blue-collar in the factory
and the “big boss” would be considered “about right.” That would make
the “after-tax take-home pay” of the “big boss” somewhere around 5,000
to 00,000 a year, which would be equal to a pre-tax salary of at least
00,000. And only a mere handful of ex- ecutives earn that much, bonuses
included. If the comparison is made—as it should be— between total
incomes including fringes, deferred compensation, stock options, and all
other forms of extra compensation, a 1 to 12 ratio would work out to an
after-tax top fig- ure of 50,000. And no more than a dozen or so top men
in the very largest companies have pre-tax “total compensation package”
of 00,000 and up, which is needed to pro- duce an after-tax value of
50,000. The “extremely rich” are not employed executives— the tax system
takes care of those (as it should); they are either a few heirs of the
million- aires of pre-tax days or owners of small businesses.</p>
<p>And relative to the incomes of manual and clerical workers, after-tax
executive com- pensation, and especially the income of the men at the
very top, has been going down steadily for fifty years or more.</p>
<p>The facts of increasing income equality in U.S. society are quite
clear. Yet the popular impression is one of rapidly increasing
inequality. This is illusion; but it is a dangerous illusion. It
corrodes. It destroys mutual trust between groups that have to live
together and work together. It can only lead to political measures
which, while doing no one any good, can seriously harm society, economy,
and the manager as well.</p>
<p>In some considerable measure, the belief in growing income inequality
in the U.S. re- flects, of course, America’s racial problem. The
emergence into visibility, that is, into the big cities, of a
disenfranchised nonworking population of Blacks has created a marginal
but highly visible group suffering from extreme inequality of incomes.
That the income of the employed Negro has been going up rapidly and is
likely, within a decade or so, to be equal to that of the employed white
doing the same kind of work—and that four-fifths of the American Negroes
are employed and working—tends to be obscured by the dire pov- erty of
the much smaller but highly concentrated groups of unemployed or
unemployables in the Black ghettos of the core cities.</p>
<p>Another reason for the widespread belief in growing inequality is
inflation. Inflation is a corrosive social poison precisely because it
makes people look for a villain. The economists’ explanation that no one
benefits by inflation, that is, that no one gets the pur- chasing power
that inflation takes away from the income recipients, simply makes no
sense to ordinary experience. Somebody must have benefited, somebody
“must have sto- len what is rightfully mine.” Every inflation in history
has therefore created class hatred, mutual distrust, and beliefs that,
somehow, “the other fellow” gains illicitly at “my” ex- pense. It is
always the middle class which becomes paranoid in an inflationary period
and turns against the “system.” The inflations of the sixties in the
developed countries were no exceptions.</p>
<p>But the main cause of the dangerous delusion on increasing inequality
of income is the widely publicized enormous pre-tax incomes of a few men
at the top of a few giant corpo-</p>
<p>rations, and the equally widely publicized “extras” of executive
compensation, e.g., stock options.</p>
<p>The 00,000 a year which the chief executive of one of the giant
corporations is be- ing paid is largely “make-believe money.” Its
function is status rather than income. Most of it, whatever tax
loopholes the lawyers might find, is immediately taxed away. And the
“extras” are simply attempts to put a part of the executive’s income
into a somewhat lower tax bracket. Economically, in other words, neither
serves much purpose. But so- cially and psychologically they “knowingly
do harm.” They cannot be defended.</p>
<p>One way to eliminate the offense is for companies to commit
themselves to a maxi- mum range of after-tax compensation. The 1 to 10
ratio that the great majority of Ameri- cans would consider perfectly
acceptable, would, in fact, be wider than the actual range of most
companies. (There should, I would argue, be room, however, for an
occasional ex- ception: the rare, “once-in-a-lifetime,” very big,
“special bonus” to someone, a research scientist, a manager, or a
salesman, who has made an extraordinary contribution.)</p>
<p>But equally important is acceptance of social responsibility on the
part of managers to work for a rational system of taxation,* which
eliminates the temptation of “tax gim- micks” and the need for them.</p>
<p>There is a strong case for adequate incentives for performing
executives. And com- pensation in money is far preferable to hidden
compensation such as perquisites. If he gets money the recipient can
choose what to spend it on—rather than, as in the case of “perks,”
taking whatever the company provides, be it a chauffeur-driven car, a
big house, or (as in the case of some Swedish companies) a governess for
the children. Indeed it may well be that real incomes in American
business are not sufficiently unequal and that the compression of income
differentials in the years since 1950 has been socially and eco-
nomically detrimental.</p>
<p>What is pernicious, however, is the delusion of inequality. The basic
cause is the tax laws. But the managers’ willingness to accept, and
indeed to play along with, an antisocial tax structure is a major
contributory cause. And unless managers realize that this violates the
rule “not knowingly to do damage,” they will, in the end, be the main
sufferers.</p>
<p>The Danger of “Golden Fetters”</p>
<p>A second area in which the manager of today does not live up to the
commitment of Pri- mum non nocere is closely connected with
compensation.</p>
<p>Since World War II compensation and benefits have been increasingly
misused to create “golden fetters.”</p>
<p>Retirement benefits, extra compensation, bonuses, and stock options
are all forms of compensation. From the point of view of the
enterprise—but also from the point of view of the economy—these are
“labor costs” no matter how they are labeled. They are treated as such
by managements when they sit down to negotiate with the labor union. But
in- creasingly, if only because of the bias of the tax laws, these
benefits are being used to tie an employee to his employer. They are
being made dependent on staying with the same employer, often for many
years. And they are structured in such a way that leaving a company’s
employ entails drastic penalties and actual loss of benefits that have
already been earned and that, in effect, constitute wages relating to
past employment.</p>
<p>This may be proper in a society which, like that of Japan, is built
on lifetime employ- ment and excludes mobility. Even in Japan, however,
“golden fetters” are no longer ac- ceptable to professional and
technical employees who increasingly should have mobility in their own
interest, in that of the Japanese economy, and even in that of the
Japanese company. In the West, and especially in the United States, such
golden fetters are clearly antisocial.</p>
<p>*We know the specifications of such a system—and they are simple: no
preferential tax rates for any personal income, whether from salaries or
from capital gains, and a limit on the maximum tax—say 50 percent of
local income received.</p>
<p>Golden fetters do not strengthen the company. They lead to “negative
selection.” Peo- ple who know that they are not performing in their
present employment—that is, people who are clearly in the wrong
place—will often not move but stay where they know they do not properly
belong. But if they stay because the penalty for leaving is too great,
they resist and resent it. They know that they have been bribed and were
too weak to say no. They are likely to be sullen, resentful, and bitter
the rest of their working lives.</p>
<p>The fact that the employees themselves eagerly seek these benefits is
no excuse. After all, medieval serfdom also began as an eagerly sought
“employee benefit.”*</p>
<p>It is incumbent, therefore, on the managers to think through which of
these benefits should properly—by their own rationale—be tied to
continued employment. Stock op- tions might, for instance, belong here.
But pension rights, performance bonuses, participa- tion in profits, and
so on, have been “earned” and should be available to the employee
without restricting his rights as a citizen, an individual, and a
person. And, again, manag- ers will have to work to get the tax law
changes that are needed.</p>
<p>The Rhetoric of the Profit Motive</p>
<p>Managers, finally, through their rhetoric, make it impossible for the
public to understand economic reality. This violates the requirement
that managers, being leaders, not know- ingly do harm. This is
particularly true of the United States but also of Western Europe. For
in the West, managers still talk constantly of the profit motive. And
they still define the goal of their business as profit maximization.
They do not stress the objective function of profit. They do not talk of
risks—or very rarely. They do not stress the need for capital. They
almost never even mention the cost of capital, let alone that a business
has to pro- duce enough profit to obtain the capital it needs at minimum
cost.</p>
<p>Managers constantly, complain about the hostility to profit. They
rarely realize that their own rhetoric is one of the main reasons for
this hostility. For indeed in the terms management uses when it talks to
the public, there is no possible justification for profit, no
explanation for its existence, no function it performs. There is only
the profit motive, that is, the desire of some anonymous capitalists—and
why that desire should be indulged in by society any more than bigamy,
for instance, is never explained. But profitability is a crucial need of
economy and society.</p>
<p>Managerial practice in most large American companies is perfectly
rational. It is the rhetoric which obscures, and thereby threatens to
damage both business and society. To be sure, few American companies
work out profitability as a minimum requirement. As a result, most
probably underestimate the profitability the company truly requires (let
alone as said in Chapter 9, the inflationary erosion of capital). But
they, consciously or not, base their profit planning on the twin
objectives of ensuring access to capital needed and minimizing the cost
of capital. In the American context, if only because of the structure of
the U.S. capital market, a high “price/earnings ratio” is indeed a key
to the minimization of the cost of capital; and “optimization of
profits” is therefore a perfectly rational strat- egy which tends to
lower, in the long run, the actual cost of capital.</p>
<p>But this makes it even less justifiable to keep on using the rhetoric
of the profit mo- tive. It serves no purpose except to confuse and to
embitter.</p>
<p>These examples of areas in which managers do not hold themselves to
the rule “not knowingly to do harm” are primarily American examples.
They apply to some extent to Western Europe. But they hardly apply to
Japan. The principle, however, applies in all countries, and in the
developing countries as much as in developed ones. These cases are taken
from business management. The principle, however, applies to managers of
all in- stitutions in the society of organizations.</p>
<p>In any pluralist society responsibility for the public good has been
the central problem and issue. The pluralist society of organizations
will be no exception. Its leaders represent “special interests,” that
is, institutions designed to fulfill a specific and partial need of</p>

<p>society. Indeed the leaders of this pluralist society of
organizations are the servants of such institutions. At the same time,
they are the major leadership group such a society knows or is likely to
produce. They have to serve both their own institution and the com- mon
good. If the society is to function, let alone if it is to remain a free
society, the men we call managers will remain “private” in their
institutions. No matter who owns them and how, they will maintain
autonomy. But they will also have to be “public” in their ethics.</p>
<p>In this tension between the private functioning of the manager: the
necessary auton- omy of his institution and its accountability, to its
own mission and purpose, and the pub- lic character of the manager, lies
the specific ethical problem of the society of organiza- tions. Primum
non nocere may seem tame compared to the rousing calls for “statesman-
ship” that abound in today’s manifestos on social responsibility. But,
as the physicians found out long ago, it is not an easy rule to live up
to. Its very modesty and self-constraint make it the right rule for the
ethics managers need, the ethics of responsibility.</p>
