<h4 id="success-stories-japan-zeiss-ibm">20 Success Stories: Japan,
Zeiss, IBM</h4>
<p>Industrial Engineering in Japan—Continuous Training; Zen versus
Confucius— Lifetime Employment—But Flexible Labor Costs—To Each
According to His Needs; the Benefit System—The Godfather System—Upward
Responsibility—Ernst Abbé and the Zeiss Optical Works—The IBM Story—The
Lessons—Not Permissive Management but Organized Responsibility</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>n general, the history of working and worker is not a particularly
happy one. But there are significant exceptions. Again and again, we
find either a period or a particular or- ganization in which working is
achievement and fulfillment. The usual case is a great national
emergency, in which the worker sees himself contributing to a cause.
This hap- pened, for instance, in Great Britain in the months after
Dunkirk. On a smaller scale it occurred in the United States during
World War II. Jobs did not change. Bosses did not become more
intelligent or more humane. But the basic satisfaction of working
changed completely, if only for a limited period.</p>
<p>This can also be achieved, examples show, without great national
emergency, indeed, without any outside spur. Robert Owen made his
workers achieve in his Lanark textile mills in Scotland 150 years
ago—and he did not do anything revolutionary.</p>
<p>There are similar exceptions to be found in modern industry. The most
important—if only because of its success in worldwide economic
competition—is Japan’s organization of working and worker.</p>
<p>At first sight, nothing looks more like the extreme of Theory X than
a Japanese fac- tory or office. Japan is not a permissive country, but a
very rigid one. Its way of managing working and worker is anything but
flexible. But it differs significantly from any other way we know,
whether rigid or flexible, autocratic, or democratic. At the same time
its way is not hoary tradition. The most important features of the
Japanese system were de- veloped in the twenties and thirties of this
century and for use in modern large-scale or- ganization. The main
impetus was the importation of Taylor’s scientific management, which
began around 1920.</p>
<p>The industrial engineers in Japanese industry use the same methods,
tools, and tech- niques as the Westerner to study and to analyze work.
But the Japanese industrial engi- neer does not organize the worker’s
job. When he has reached the point at which he un- derstands the work,
he turns over the actual design of jobs to the work group itself. Actu-
ally, the industrial engineer begins to work with the people who have to
do the job long before he finishes his analysis. He will study the work
the same way his Western counter- part does. But he will, in his study,
constantly use the work force itself as his “resource.” When he has
finished his analysis, the synthesis will essentially be done by the
work group itself. The industrial engineer continues his, activities,
but he does so as “assistant” to the work group rather than as outside
analyst.</p>
<p>The Japanese worker very largely also takes responsibility for
improving his tools.</p>
<p>Machines in modern industry are, of course, designed by the engineer,
but when a new</p>
<p>machine or a new process is being introduced, the workers are
expected to take an active part in the final adjustment, the final
arrangement, the specific application of machine and tools. In many
businesses the work force actually participates in machine design and
acts as a resource to machine or process designer.</p>
<p>Zen versus Confucius</p>
<p>The mechanism for making the worker take responsibility for job and
tools is what the Japanese call “continuous training.” Every employee,
often up to and including top man- agers, keeps on training as a regular
part of his job until he retires. The weekly training session is a
regular and scheduled part of a man’s work. It is not run, as a rule, by
a trainer but by the men themselves and their supervisors. The technical
people, e.g., the industrial engineers, may attend but do not lead; they
are there to help, to inform, to advise—and to learn themselves.</p>
<p>The training session does not focus on any one skill. It is attended
by all men on a given job level and focuses on all the jobs within the
unit. The training session which the plant electrician attends will be
attended also by the machine operator in the same plant, by the man who
sets up and maintains the machines, and by the sweeper who pushes a
broom—and by all their supervisors. Its focus will be the working of the
plant rather than the job of this or that man.</p>
<p>Similarly, the accountant is expected to be trained—or to familiarize
himself in the training sessions of his office group, and through
correspondence courses, seminars, or continuation schools—in every
single one of the professional jobs needed in his company, such as
personnel, training, and purchasing.</p>
<p>The president of a fairly large company once told me casually that he
could not see me on a certain afternoon because he was attending his
company’s training session in weld- ing—and as a student, rather than as
an observer or teacher. This is unusual. But the com- pany president who
takes a correspondence course in computer programming is fairly common.
The young personnel man does so as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Underlying this is a very different concept of the purpose and nature
of learning from that prevailing in the West—but also in the China of
the Confucian tradition. The Confu- cian concept, which the West shares,
assumes that the purpose of learning is to qualify oneself for a new,
different, and bigger job. The nature of learning is expressed in a
learn- ing curve. Within a certain period of time this student reaches a
plateau of proficiency, where he then stays forever.</p>
<p>Japanese institutions are far mare rigidly departmentalized and
sectionalized than most Western institutions—though probably less
rigidly than the highly bureaucratic Soviet organization. Departments in
Japan fight fiercely for their territorial integrity. They have utmost
expertise in “empire building.” The individual member of a department is
ex- pected to be completely loyal to it, yet the individual employee
tends to see beyond the boundaries of his own specialty and his own
department. He knows what goes on. He knows the work of others, even
though he himself has never performed it. He sees a genu- ine whole, and
he is expected to be concerned with the performance of every single job
in</p>
<p>this genuine whole. He, therefore, can see his own place in the
structure and his own con- tribution.</p>
<p>Finally, continuous training creates receptivity for the new, the
different, the innova- tive, the more productive. The focus in the
training sessions is always on doing the job</p>
<p>better, doing it differently, doing it in new ways.</p>
<p>The training sessions actually generate pressure on the industrial
engineers. In the West, the industrial engineer starts out with the
assumption of resistance to his approach by the employee, whether in
manual or in clerical work. In Japan the industrial engineer tends to
complain that the employees expect and demand too much from him.</p>
<p>The commitment to continuous training makes the entire work force in
a Japanese in- stitution receptive to change and innovation rather than
resistant to it. At the same time, training mobilizes the experience and
knowledge of the employee for constructive im-</p>
<p>provement.</p>
<p>One basic problem in studies of employee satisfaction in the West has
always been that there are two kinds of dissatisfaction. There are
negative and positive dissatisfaction. There is the complaint about
frustration, arbitrariness, speed-up, poor pay, poor working
conditions—the negative dissatisfactions. There is also impatience with
poor working methods, desire to do a better job, demand for better, more
intelligent, more systematic management. The Japanese continuous
training mobilizes positive dissatisfaction and makes it productive.</p>
<p>Lifetime Employment</p>
<p>The Japanese system, as everybody knows, is different in its approach
to economics. Eve- ryone has heard that there is “lifetime employment”
in Japan. The majority of Japanese workers, at least in the modern
Japanese economy (i.e., the economic institutions that were started
after 1867 and in all other modern institutions such as government
agencies), are guaranteed a job once they have joined an employer. At
the same time, they cannot, as a rule, leave and go to work for somebody
else. Both employee and employer are tied to each other. This is
becoming less true. The labor shortage, especially among younger in-
dustrial workers, has led to a good deal of raiding. Highly trained
technical people— engineers, physicists, and chemists—have acquired
considerable mobility. But it is still true that the typical Japanese
large employer cannot usually dismiss or lay off an em- ployee, except
in extreme emergency.</p>
<p>As a result, the fear of losing one’s job for the ordinary economic
reasons, because of technological changes, or because of arbitrary
management action, is largely absent in Japan. There is a haunting fear
in the Japanese system, the fear of losing one’s member- ship in the
employing institution. In the Japanese tradition there is no place for
ronin, the masterless man. Nor, if only because of the seniority system
of wages, is it possible, as a rule, for a man to find a job except on
the entrance level, so that anyone who is unem- ployed past age thirty
is practically unemployable. This creates tremendous fear of the
consequences of personal misbehavior, i.e., tremendous pressure for
conformity. It also creates genuine fear lest the enterprise itself may
go under—which, in turn, then makes the Japanese willing to go to very
great lengths to maintain the competitive position of their employer,
whether the competitive position of a business in the market, or the
com- petitive position of a government agency in the continuous
infighting of Japanese politics.</p>
<p>The fear of dismissal or of being out of work are minimized in the
Japanese system. It has to operate without the stick of Theory X. It
also has to do without the carrot of eco- nomic rewards. Pay, except for
a tiny group of top managers—and then only after age forty-five or
so—has been tied to length of service for the last half century (and
again, mainly in modern institutions). In each, of the three categories
in which Japanese tradition divides the work force, if not all
humanity—manual worker, clerical worker, and man- ager—entrance pay is
the same for everybody in the company, and so is the entrance
age—respectively fifteen, eighteen, and twenty two. Progression in pay,
as well as pro-</p>
<p>gression in title, are then automatic—for manual and clerical worker
until retirement, for managers until age forty-five. Pay and title
depend on length of service.</p>
<p>But Flexible Labor Costs</p>
<p>The Japanese system, most Westerners would say; can work only as long
as pay levels are very low. The system, so it would appear to any
Westerner, must lead to totally inflexible and rigid labor costs. But
Japan actually has remarkable flexibility in labor costs.</p>
<p>One minor explanation of this is the existence of a temporary work
force, which can be laid off without any notice. Women are, almost by
definition, always considered tem- porary workers; very few married
women work in Japan, except on the farm and in small retail shops, i.e.,
in “pre-modern” work. In Japanese traditional businesses, such as the
old workshop industries producing lacquer, pottery, or silk, workers are
almost never perma- nent, but almost always temporary and paid often by
the hour. But the temporary work force is shrinking fast. In most modern
industries it is by now almost nonexistent except for women workers. Yet
labor costs are far from rigid. Only the flexibility of labor costs is
structured so as to be a minimum threat to the worker’s job and income
security.</p>
<p>Actually, most Japanese companies, especially the larger ones, can
and do lay off a larger proportion of their work force, when business
falls off, than most Western compa- nies are likely or able to do. Yet
they do so in such a fashion that the employees who need incomes the
most are fully protected. The burden of adjustment is taken by those who
can afford it and who have alternate incomes to fall back on.</p>
<p>What makes labor costs more flexible than they are in most countries
and industries of the West is the retirement system (or perhaps it
should be called the non-retirement sys- tem). This system harmonizes in
a highly ingenious fashion the worker’s need for job and income
guarantees with the economy’s need for flexible labor costs.</p>
<p>Official retirement in Japan is at age fifty-five—for everyone except
a few who at forty-five become members of top management and are not
expected to retire at any fixed age. At fifty-five, it is said, the
employee, whether he is a floor sweeper or a department head, retires.
Traditionally, he gets a severance bonus equal to about two years of
full pay. (Many companies, strongly backed by the government, are now
installing supplementary pension payments, but by Western standards
these payments are still exceedingly low.)</p>
<p>Considering that life expectancy in Japan is now fully up to Western
standards, so that most employees can expect to live to seventy or more,
this bonus seems wholly inade- quate. Yet one hears few complaints about
the dire fate of the pensioners. More amazing still, one encounters in
every Japanese factory, office, and bank, people who cheerfully admit to
being quite a bit older than fifty-five and who quite obviously are
still working. What is the explanation?</p>
<p>The rank-and-file blue-collar or white-collar employee ceases to be a
permanent em- ployee at age fifty-five and becomes a temporary worker.
This means that he can be laid off if there is not enough work. If there
is enough work—and, of course, there has been from 1950 on—he stays on,
very often doing the same work as before, side by side with the
permanent employee with whom he has been working for many years; but for
this work he now gets at least one-third less than he got when he was a
permanent employee.</p>
<p>The rationale is simple. As the Japanese see it, the man has
something to fall back on when he retires—the two-year pension. This,
they freely admit, is not enough to keep a man alive for fifteen years
or so. But it is usually enough to tide him over a bad spell. And since
he no longer has, as a rule, dependent children or parents whom he has
to support, his needs should be considerably lower than they were when
he was, say, forty and probably had both children and parents to look
after.</p>
<p>If my intent were to describe the Japanese employment system, I would
now have to go into a great many rather complicated details, such as the
role of the semiannual bonus. But I am concerned only with what we in
the West might learn from the Japanese. For us, the main interest of the
Japanese system, I submit, is the way in which it satisfies two ap-</p>
<p>parently mutually contradictory needs: (1) job and income security;
and (2) flexible, adaptable labor forces and labor costs.</p>
<p>In the West, during the last twenty-five years, more and more
employees have attained income maintenance that may often exceed what
the Japanese worker gets under life em- ployment. There is, for
instance, the supplementary unemployment benefit of the U.S.
mass-production industries which, in effect, guarantees the unionized
worker most of his income even during fairly lengthy layoffs. Indeed, it
may well be argued that labor costs in U.S. mass-production industries
are more rigid than they are in Japan, even though American managements
can rapidly adjust the number of men at work to the order flow, in
contrast to the Japanese practice of maintaining employment for
permanent employees almost regardless of business conditions.
Increasingly, also, we find in the heavily union- ized mass-production
industries provisions for early retirement, such as were written in the
fall of 1970 into the contract of the U.S. automobile industry.</p>
<p>Still, unionized employees in the West are laid off according to
seniority, with the ones with the least seniority going first. As a
result, we offer the least security of jobs and incomes to the men who
need predictable incomes the most—the fathers of young fami- lies (who
also may have older parents to support). Where there is early
retirement, it means, as a rule, that the worker has to make a decision
to retire permanently. Once he has opted for early retirement, he is out
of the work force and unlikely to be hired back by any employer. In
short, the U.S. labor force (and its counterparts in Europe) lacks the
feeling of economic and job security which is so pronounced a feature of
Japanese soci- ety.</p>
<p>The West pays for a high degree of income maintenance. We have
imposed on our- selves high rigidity with respect to labor costs, but we
get very few tangible benefits from these practices. Also, we do not get
the psychological security which is so prominent in Japanese
society—i.e., the deep conviction of a man of working age that he need
not worry about his job and his income. Instead we have fear. The
younger men fear that they will be laid off first, just when the
economic needs of their families are at their peak; the older men fear
that they will lose their jobs in their fifties, when they are too old
to be hired elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the Japanese system there is confidence in both age groups. The
younger men feel they can look forward to a secure job and steadily
rising income while their children are growing up; the older men feel
they are still wanted, still useful, and not a burden on soci- ety.</p>
<p>In practice, of course, the Japanese system is no more perfect than
any other system.</p>
<p>There are plenty of inequities in it. The young, especially the young
highly trained knowl- edge people, are grossly underpaid—to the point
where they have to postpone marriage and the start of a family until
they have eight to ten years of seniority. The young are, indeed, in
rebellion against the enforced subsidy to the older worker, which the
Japanese pay system exacts from them. Despite the outward deference paid
to age, the treatment of older people over fifty-five leaves much to be
desired. They are often ruthlessly exploited, especially in the small
workshop industries of “pre-industrial” Japan and in the multitude of
small service businesses. But the basic principle which the Japanese
have evolved—not by planning rationally, but by applying traditional
Japanese concepts of mutual obligation to employment and labor
economics—seems to make more sense and works better than the expensive
patchwork solutions we in the West have developed, which do not come to
grips with the problem itself. Economically, it might be said, we have
greater security in our system—we certainly pay more for it. Yet, we
have not obtained what the Japanese system produces, the psychological
conviction of job and income security.</p>
<p>To Each According to His Needs; the Benefit System</p>
<p>Western analysis of Japan focuses on money wages, if only because in
the West they have traditionally been the main, if not the sole, element
of labor cost. But in Japan, non-wage labor costs have, for many years,
if not for centuries, been at least as important as wages.</p>
<p>The importance of the fringes is rapidly diminishing in Japan as wage
incomes have been rising. Still, they are a larger part of the total
labor-cost bill than in Western or communist countries. In many
industries they still almost equal cash wages.</p>
<p>At first sight the Japanese benefit system is incomprehensible to an
outsider. There is no system. In one company there are housing
allowances; a second company builds work- ers’ housing; a third one does
nothing about housing. There are educational allowances in one company.
The next company runs a company school for women employees which teaches
the traditional accomplishments of the Japanese “lady,” i.e., flower
arrangement, the tea ceremony, dressmaking (and a little English
conversation). One company seems to take care of the widow and orphaned
children of a deceased employee, another company seems to pay no
attention to them.</p>
<p>Actually, there is a system: to shape benefits according to the need
of specific groups within the work force. If the company employs a large
number of young women, the great majority of whom will get married very
soon, pension benefits—or even a first-rate medi- cal plan—are of little
value. But learning the accomplishments of the married woman is of very
great value. If an employee dies and leaves a destitute widow with small
children, the company is expected to take responsibility. If the widow
is well off, or has a well-to-do brother, there is no need for the
company to concern itself, and accordingly, no obliga- tion.</p>
<p>The paternalism of the Japanese benefits system would not be
acceptable in the West nor would the absence of legally grounded rights
and obligations. In fact, it is question- able how long this will be
acceptable even in Japan. There is tremendous pressure, from public
opinion, from workers, from the government (but amazingly enough, not
from la- bor unions) to systematize the benefits system and to give the
employee predictable rights.</p>
<p>The basic concept, however, that benefits should be structured to the
needs of the em- ployee, particularly to the needs of specific groups
within the employees—e.g., young women workers or old male workers,
people with large families or unmarried or older couples whose children
have grown up—is fundamental to the Japanese approach to man- aging
worker and working.</p>
<p>The Godfather System</p>
<p>The house of Mitsui is the oldest of the world’s big businesses. It
dates back to 1637, half a century before the Bank of England was
founded. It also was the largest of the world’s big businesses until the
American occupation split it into individual companies. (As these
companies come back together into a fairly close confederation, Mitsui
may well again become the world’s biggest business.)</p>
<p>In the more than three hundred years of its business life, Mitsui has
never had a chief executive (the Japanese term is “chief
banto”—literally, chief clerk) who was not an out- standing man and a
powerful leader. This accomplishment is not matched by any other
institution, whether the Catholic Church, any government, army, navy,
university, or cor- poration.</p>
<p>What explains this amazing achievement? In Japan one always gets the
same answer: until recently, the chief banto—himself never a member of
the Mitsui family but a hired hand—had one main job: manager
development, manager selection, and manager place- ment. He spent a
great deal of time with the young people who came in as junior manag-
ers or professionals. He knew them. He listened to them. As a result, he
knew, by the time they had reached thirty or so, which ones were likely
to reach top management, what ex- periences and development they needed,
and in what job they should be tried and tested.</p>
<p>At first sight nothing would seem less likely to develop strong
executives than the Japanese system. It would seem, rather, to be the
ideal prescription for developing timid men selected for proven
mediocrity and trained not to rock the boat.</p>
<p>The young men who enter a Japanese company’s employ directly from the
univer- sity—and, by and large, this is the only way to get into a
company’s management, since</p>
<p>hiring from the outside and into upper-level positions is the rare
exception—know that they will have a job until they retire, no matter
how poorly they perform. Until they reach age forty-five, they will be
promoted and paid by seniority and by seniority alone.</p>
<p>There seems to be no performance appraisal, nor would there be much
point to it, when a man can be neither rewarded for performance nor
penalized for nonperformance. Superiors do not choose their
subordinates: the personnel people make personnel deci- sions as a rule,
often without consulting the manager to whom a subordinate is being as-
signed. It seems to be unthinkable for a young manager or professional
to ask for a trans- fer, and equally unthinkable for him to quit and go
elsewhere.</p>
<p>This process goes on for twenty to twenty-five years, during which
all the emphasis seems to be on conforming, on doing what one is being
asked to do, and on showing proper respect and deference.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, when a man reaches forty-five, the day of reckoning
arrives, when the goats are separated from the sheep. A very small group
is picked to become company directors—that is, top management. They can
stay in management well past any retire- ment age known in the West,
with active top-management people in their eighties by no means a
rarity. The rest of the group, from department director on down,
generally stay in management until they are fifty-five, usually with at
best one more promotion. Then they are retired—and, unlike the
rank-and-file employees, their retirement is compulsory.</p>
<p>Limited but important exceptions to this rule are made in the case of
outstanding men who, while too specialized to move into the top
management of the parent company, are assigned to the top management of
subsidiaries or affiliates. In such positions they can also stay in
office for an indefinite period of time.</p>
<p>To an outsider who believes what the Japanese tell him—namely, that
this is really the way the system works—it is hard to understand on what
basis the crucial decision at age forty-five is made. It is even harder
to believe that this system produces independent and aggressive top
managers who have marketed Japanese exports successfully all over the
world and who have, in the space of twenty years, made into the
second-ranking eco- nomic power in the world a nation that, at the eve
of World War II, was not even among the first dozen or so in industrial
production or capital.</p>
<p>It is precisely because Japanese managers have lifetime employment
and can, as a rule, be neither fired nor moved, and because advancement
for the first twenty-five years of a man’s working life is through
seniority alone that the Japanese have made the care and feeding of
their young people the first responsibility of top management.</p>
<p>The practice goes back almost four hundred years, when the samurai,
the retainers of a military clan, were organized into tight hereditary
castes with advancement from one to the other officially not permitted.
At the same time, the government of the clan had to find able people who
could run the clan’s affairs at a very early age and take their
opportuni- ties without offending higher ranking but less gifted clan
members.</p>
<p>Today, of course, it is no longer possible for the chief banto of
Mitsui to know per- sonally the young managerial people, as his
predecessor did a few generations ago. Even much smaller companies are
too large and have far too many young managerial and pro- fessional
employees in their ranks. Yet top management is still vitally concerned
with the young. It discharges this concern through an informal network
of senior middle- management people who act as “godfathers” to the young
men during the first ten years of their careers in the company.</p>
<p>The Japanese take this system for granted. Every young manager knows
who his god- father is, and so does his boss and the boss’s boss.</p>
<p>The godfather is rarely a young man’s direct superior; he may not
even be in the direct line of authority over the young man or his
department. He is rarely a member of top management and rarely a man who
will get into top management. He tends to be picked from members of
upper-middle management who will, when they reach fifty-five, be
transferred to the top management of a subsidiary or affiliate. In other
words, godfathers are people who know, having been passed over at age
forty-five for the top management spots, that they are not going to make
it in their own organization. Therefore, they are not</p>
<p>likely to build factions of their own or to play internal politics.
At the same time, they are the most highly respected members of the
middle-management group.</p>
<p>During the first ten years or so of a young man’s career, the
godfather is expected to be in close touch with his godchild, even
though in a large company he may have a hun- dred of them at any one
time. He is expected to know the young man, see him fairly regu- larly,
be available to him for advice and counsel, and, in general, look after
him.</p>
<p>If a young man gets stuck under an incompetent manager and needs to
be transferred, the godfather knows where to go and how to do what
officially cannot be done and, ac- cording to the Japanese, is never
done. Yet nobody will ever know about it. If the young man is naughty
and needs to be disciplined, the godfather will spank him in private. By
the time a young man is thirty, the godfather knows a great deal about
him, and so does top management.</p>
<p>The great weakness of all Japanese organizations is their tendency
toward the forma- tion of cliques—the Japanese word is habatsu. Personal
loyalty to a clique leader be- comes the first duty of a man. In turn,
belonging to the right clique becomes the one re- quirement of success.
The incompetent but loyal habatsu man finds himself rewarded, while the
most competent man who does not belong to the victorious habatsu may
find himself out in the cold. The godfather system can clearly become
the worst kind of clique—and sometimes does. Equally, it can easily
degenerate into the worst kind of pa- ternalism and into tremendous
pressure for conformity.</p>
<p>Still, the young knowledge worker in the Japanese organization is not
left orphaned.</p>
<p>Nor is he being neglected. He has somebody to go to with his
questions, his doubts, whether about himself or about his organization,
with his aspirations and expectations. In turn, there is somebody in the
company who cares for him, somebody who knows how the machinery works
and who can smooth the young man’s path, who can guide the young man’s
steps, but who can also administer, in complete privacy, very effective
discipline.</p>
<p>The manual worker and the clerical worker also have their godfathers.
For the manual worker, the role is being played by one of the
supervisors. He is, indeed, far less a super- visor than he is a
counselor if only because he has no weapons of enforcement. He cannot
dismiss a man. He cannot prevent his getting more pay when he acquires
the proper sen- iority. He cannot block a promotion.</p>
<p>By western standards there is little courtesy and less warmth to the
relationship be- tween supervisor and man in the Japanese organization.
There is not even much civility. Terms of personal abuse which would
bring about an immediate work stoppage in any unionized Western
plant—and would be unthinkable in most Western offices—are com- mon. In
this respect, Japan still follows the old tradition in which the teacher
of the young warrior or the great Zen master showed his concern for the
pupil by beating him. At the same time, the superior in Japan is
expected to concern himself with the needs, the expec- tations, the
aspirations, the questions of the younger man. And the seniority system
makes sure that the subordinate is always a younger man.</p>
<p>Upward Responsibility</p>
<p>The Japanese organization is infinitely more autocratic than anything
that can be found in the West, outside of the military. The deference
accorded the superior, beginning with the language used toward him, goes
far beyond the most deferential of Western traditions. And yet authority
from the top down is always matched by responsibility from the bottom
up.</p>
<p>This is the real meaning of the phrase “consensus decision.” It is
not true that the Japanese make decisions by consensus. This would
clearly result in the wrong decisions. Above all, it would inevitably
lead to compromise. If there is one thing that is typical of Japanese
decisions, it is that they are not compromises. The typical Japanese
decision is a radical departure—the system is so complex and cumbersome
that small decisions cannot be taken. (On this see Chapter 37.)</p>
<p>At every level of the organization, subordinates are expected to
participate in the re- sponsibility for the decision. They are expected
to think through what the decision is all about. They are expected to do
so by taking responsibility for the performance of the whole, for the
good of the organization, rather than for their own narrow parochial
point of view (though every Japanese will admit that this is hope rather
than reality).</p>
<p>There are limitations. The participants in the decision-making
process must always be members of one’s own group. In other words,
manual workers are not expected to con- cern themselves with a
managerial decision. Similarly, top management would not nor- mally
concern itself with the organization of work and jobs. This is for the
workers, for the supervisors, for the engineers in the plant.</p>
<p>Participation, however, is not in decision-making. It is in
“decision-thinking.” It is not in terms of Western constitutional theory
participation in authority. It is, however, genu- ine participation in
responsibility.</p>
<p>Though these Japanese practices are not “old Japan” but of very
recent origin and de- veloped since the 1920s, if not since the end of
World War II, they do, of course, reflect basic Japanese beliefs and
basic Japanese values. They cannot be transplanted into the cultural
soil of the West. But that the underlying approaches are not
specifically “Japa- nese” is proven by Western examples where similar
approaches have been used, and with equal effectiveness.</p>
<p>Ernst Abbé and the Zeiss Optical Works</p>
<p>In the economic rise of nineteenth-century Germany, the optical
industry played a key part. By 1890 Germany had a virtual world monopoly
on precision optics. While this mo- nopoly was broken by World War I,
Germany retained a dominant position until World War II. Precision
optics were principally the achievement of one firm, the Carl Zeiss
Works in Jena. Carl Zeiss (1816-1888), whose name the company still
bears, was himself a major innovator and inventor, but his greatest
contribution was his early realization that modern industry has to be
based on modern science. Himself a craftsman and descended from a long
line of lens makers, he early established a partnership with a
university- trained physicist, Ernst Abbé (1840-1905). After Zeiss’s
death in 1888, it was Abbé who took over the management of the
company.</p>
<p>Abbé was one of the first of the great scientist-inventors—and an
exceedingly produc- tive one. He revolutionized both the making of
optical glass and the making of precision lenses. But his greatest
achievement was not in science nor in business but in managing working
arid worker.</p>
<p>Independently of Taylor, Abbé applied what can only be called
scientific manage- ment, that is, the systematic study of work. He
analyzed the constituent operations needed to make optical glass and
then to convert optical glass into precision lenses. He then syn-
thesized both processes. The solution he came up with, around 1880 or
1885, can only be described as flexible mass production. But Abbé did
not, as Henry Ford was to do twenty years later, proceed to organize
working on the basis of these operations. Instead he turned over
responsibility for working out the jobs to the work force itself. He
called in the masters and journeymen from the plant, explained to them
the new techniques and disciplines, and asked them to organize the jobs
and to do the work.</p>
<p>To make optical glass in the quality and quantity needed—let alone at
a cost that would allow its use in such everyday instruments as
microscopes, cameras, or specta- cles—required entirely new machinery
and new tools. From the beginning, Abbé insisted that the skilled worker
himself, with the assistance of the university-educated scientist and
engineer, develop the machinery. The world monopoly which Zeiss held for
so many years rested, above all, on equipment designed, or at least
improved, by the workers themselves.</p>
<p>Abbé also introduced continuous training. By 1880 German industry had
largely sys- tematized apprentice training by combining work under a
master with schoolwork in ap- prentice classes. Abbé added systematic
training classes for fully trained and highly</p>
<p>skilled craftsmen which they were expected to attend throughout their
entire working life. There were frequent refresher sessions. The most
highly skilled men were expected to join with the engineers, chemists,
lens designers, and instrument designers in working on better methods,
on new products, and on improvements in process and technology. The
focus, as in Japan, was not on training for promotion, but on training
for improvement of skill, tool, process, and product.</p>
<p>In one respect, Abbé went far beyond the Japanese. He insisted on
feedback informa- tion to the worker regarding his output and
performance. “A craftsman is in control of his work” was a slogan he
constantly repeated.</p>
<p>There was no formal guarantee of employment security at Zeiss. Abbé,
as well as his German craftsmen, would have rejected as immoral the
Japanese custom of keeping an incompetent or lazy man on the payroll as
long as he is “loyal.” But if a man had learned to perform and showed
himself willing to work hard, he was assured of his job at Zeiss
regardless of economic fluctuations.</p>
<p>In his will, Abbé turned over the controlling ownership of Zeiss to a
foundation to which all profits were to go and of which the Zeiss
workers are to be the sole beneficiar- ies. This did not mean worker
control. The Ernst Abbé Foundation is, in effect, run by Zeiss
management and its appointed trustees. It did not make “capitalists” out
of the workers, nor was it intended to do so. Indeed, the Zeiss workers
were proud social de- mocrats from early days. Nor did it mean more
money to the workers. With ownership vested in the foundation, the Zeiss
firm had to depend on internally generated funds for its expansion,
which, in all likelihood, meant that dividends had to be kept very low.
But the Abbé Foundation could finance benefits for the workers, and from
Abbé’s own days on, these benefits were tailored to the needs of major
groups within the work force, whether scholarships for workers’
children, health benefits, or housing allowances. This made a little
money go very far toward protecting Zeiss workers against major risks
and toward providing truly meaningful benefits.</p>
<p>The IBM Story</p>
<p>The final success story to be presented here is that of IBM.*</p>
<p>Long before IBM became the world’s leading computer manufacturer, it
was a pro- ducer of fairly sophisticated technical products—at least for
that time. Today, of course, IBM’s computers and the software that goes
with them are among the most complex, most highly engineered, most
precise industrial products made anywhere. At the same time, they must
be capable of operation by mechanically unskilled personnel and must
stand up under rough usage and under a great variety of conditions.</p>
<p>This equipment is not produced by highly skilled individual
craftsmen. The equipment could be turned out neither in large quantities
nor at a price the customer could afford to pay were its production
dependent on craft skills. IBM uses semiskilled machine opera- tors. It
is prime evidence that scientific management and flexible
mass-production princi- ples can be applied to the production of the
most complex precision instruments in great diversity and in small
numbers. Of a particular model, an advanced electronic computer, for
instance, only one piece may ever be made. Yet by dividing into
homogeneous stages the job of building this unique product, IBM is able
to use semiskilled labor for all but a small part of the work. But each
job is designed so as always to contain a challenge to judgment, and
control of the speed and rhythm of his work by the worker. The story
goes that Thomas J. Watson, Sr., the company’s founder and for many
years its president, once saw a woman operator sitting idly at her
machine. Asked why she did not work, the woman replied, “I have to wait
for the setup man to change the tool setting for a new run.” “Couldn’t
you do it yourself?” Watson asked. “Of course,” said the woman, “but I
am not supposed to.” Watson thereupon found out that each worker spent
several hours each</p>
<p>*I am indebted to the study of IBM—written just before IBM’s meteoric
rise as the leading computer manufac- turer—by Charles R. Walker and F.
L. W. Richardson, Human Relations in an Expanding Company (Yale
University Press, 1948).</p>
<p>week waiting for the setup man. It would, however, take only a few
additional days of training for the worker to learn how to set up his
own machine. Thus, machine setup was added to the worker’s job. Shortly
thereafter, inspection of the finished part was included too; again
little additional training equipped the worker to do the inspecting.</p>
<p>Enlarging the job in this way produced such unexpected improvements
in output and quality of production that IBM decided to make jobs big
systematically. The operations themselves are engineered to be as simple
as possible, but each worker is trained to be able to do as many of
these operations as possible. At least one of the tasks the worker is to
perform—machine setting, for instance—is always designed so as to
require some skill or some judgment, and a range of different operations
permits variations in the rhythm with which the worker works.</p>
<p>This approach has resulted in a constant increase in productivity at
IBM. It has also significantly affected the attitudes of workers. In
fact, many observers both inside and outside the company think that the
increase in the worker’s pride in the job he is doing is the most
important gain.</p>
<p>IBM then redefined the supervisor’s job. There is no supervisor in
the traditional sense. Where other companies speak of supervisor or
foreman, IBM speaks of an “assis- tant.” This is exactly the role the
supervisor is supposed to discharge. He is to be the “as- sistant” to
his workers. His job is to be sure that they know their work and have
the tools. He is not their boss.</p>
<p>The policy of maximizing jobs has also enabled IBM to create
significant opportuni- ties for semiskilled workers. In each foreman’s
department there are one or more job in- structors. There are senior
workers who do their own work but who also help the other, less
experienced workers learn higher technical skills and solve problems
requiring ex- perience or judgment. Those positions are greatly coveted
and carry high prestige. They have proven to be an excellent preparation
for manager. They both train and test men so well that IBM has little
difficulty in finding candidates for promotion. Nor is it plagued by the
failure of newly promoted foremen to perform or to command their
subordinates’ re- spect. In most other industrial plants these are real
problems. In some companies less than half of all promotions to foreman
really “take.”</p>
<p>The second IBM innovation also seems to have developed half by
accident. When one of the first electronic computers was being developed
in the late forties, demand for it was so great (or maybe engineering
design had taken so much longer than expected) that pro- duction had to
begin before the engineering work was fully completed. The final details
were worked out on the production floor with the engineers collaborating
with foremen and workers. The result was a superior design; the
production engineering was signifi- cantly better, cheaper, faster; and
each worker, as a result of participating in engineering the product and
his work, did a significantly better and more productive job.</p>
<p>The lesson of this experience is being applied whenever IBM
introduces a new prod- uct or a major change in existing products.
Before design engineering is completed, the project is assigned to one
of the work crews. The “assistant” becomes manager of the project. He
works on the final details of design with the engineers and with the
workers who will produce the machines. He and his workers—with whatever
expert technical help is needed—plan the actual production layout and
set up the individual jobs. The worker, in other words, gets in on the
planning of the product, of the production process, and of his own job.
This method, wherever used, has given the same benefits in design,
produc- tion costs, speed, and worker satisfaction as were obtained the
first time.</p>
<p>IBM has been equally unorthodox in its rewards and incentives for
workers. Origi- nally it used the standard approach; output norms set by
the industrial engineer for each operation, a base wage for production
according to the norm, and incentive premium pay for production above
the norm. Then, in 1936, it did away with the traditional norms and with
pay incentives. Instead of wages per unit produced, IBM pays each worker
a straight salary (plus, of course, overtime payments, vacation pay,
etc.). Instead of output norms imposed from above, each worker develops
with his own foreman his own rates of pro- duction. Of course, both know
pretty well how much output can normally be expected.</p>
<p>But even for new operations or for major changes in process or job,
the determination of output norms is left to the men themselves. IBM
maintains that there is no such thing as a norm, but that each man works
out for himself, with his assistant’s help, the speed and flow of work
that will give him the most production.</p>
<p>One important result of this has been increasing emphasis by foremen
and workers alike on training and, especially, on placement. It is
obvious to everybody at IBM that there are tremendous differences in the
ability of men to do even unskilled work. Conse- quently, each foreman
tries hard to put each man on the job for which he is best fitted. And
the man himself tries to find the job he can do best—or to acquire the
skills to do his own job better.</p>
<p>When worker output went up right after the new salary plan had been
installed, many people critical of the whole idea (including a good many
in IBM) explained this away as owing to the worker’s fear of losing his
job; 1936, after all, was a Depression year. But worker output kept on
climbing right through the war years, when even large wage incen- tives
could not prevent its slipping in most other industries. And it has
continued to go up. Worker output, however, would hardly have stayed up,
let alone risen steadily, but for the company’s policy of stable
employment. This, the most radical of IBM’s innovations, was adopted
early in the Great Depression.</p>
<p>IBM is a capital-goods producer. Its products are used primarily by
business. By defi- nition, employment in such an enterprise is extremely
sensitive to economic fluctuations. At IBM’s main competitors,
employment was cut back sharply during the Depression years. IBM
management decided, however, that it was its job to maintain employment.
There was obviously only one way to do this: to develop new markels. IBM
was so suc- cessful in finding and developing these markets that
employment was actually fully main- tained right through the
thirties.</p>
<p>The Lessons</p>
<p>None of these cases deals with a miracle. None of these, more
importantly, presents a panacea.</p>
<p>This is certainly true of Japan. Indeed, the Japanese approaches,
policies, and prac- tices are rapidly becoming inappropriate to Japanese
social reality. They are being un- dermined by the same forces which
undermine the organization of working and work eve- rywhere: the
education explosion, and affluence. The education explosion is rapidly
creat- ing a labor shortage in the group from which manual workers in
Japan have always been recruited. There are no longer many youngsters,
and especially not very many young males, who leave school at age
fifteen. As a result the neat and tidy wage structure of tra- ditional
Japan is under increasing inflationary pressure which threatens to
explode the entire system of low entrance wages, guaranteed wage
increases by seniority, the benefits structure, and so on. At the same
time the young knowledge worker, the engineer or ac- countant,
increasingly chafes under a system that denies him mobility and
opportunity to rise by performance rather than by length of service.
Altogether Japan probably needs as much innovation in managing working
and worker in the next twenty years as it did when it first became a
major industrial society, around 1920.</p>
<p>Ernst Abbé’s foundation still owns and runs the Zeiss companies in
West Germany.</p>
<p>And Zeiss is still one of the most honored names in world optics. But
long ago, well be- fore World War II, Zeiss began to lose the momentum
which Abbé had given it. And a main reason for Zeiss’s relative
stagnation has, paradoxically, been Ernst Abbé himself. By providing for
exclusive ownership of the Zeiss companies in the interest of the worker
Abbé’s will bars outside financing and makes it impossible for Zeiss to
raise the capital it needs to grow and to move into new fields.</p>
<p>At IBM one of the crucial principles of the founder can hardly be
maintained any longer: employment security. With 260,000 employees, IBM
cannot guarantee every job, as it did forty years ago when employment
was in the hundreds or so. IBM has already had to lay off people—though
so far it has confined layoffs to managerial and profes-</p>
<p>sional personnel and has been able to maintain the employment
guarantee for manual workers, for whom it was, of course, originally
designed.</p>
<p>Still, while these policies are neither panaceas nor likely to endure
for eternity, they have surely been highly successful.</p>
<p>The spirit of its labor force has been one of the central factors in
the emergence of Ja- pan as the world’s second-ranking industrial power.
Zeiss owed its rapid rise and its long leadership position to the
strength of its work community, the enthusiasm of its workers, and the
creative impact they had on product, process, and tools. IBM has had the
most rapid expansion of work force any one company in industrial history
has ever reported— from a few thousand as late as 1950 to 260,000 or so
twenty years later. Yet IBM has had no labor troubles anywhere—even in
the one major plant that is located in the worst in- dustrial
“earthquake zone,” in the “Red suburbs” of Paris. It has not had major
production problems, even though the labor force more than doubled each
year. The only explanation is that the IBM workers were ready to accept
responsibility for, and to train the newcom- ers. While no computer
manufacturer is likely to have particularly high labor efficiency so
far—efficiency rarely goes together with constant upheaval—IBM, by
common consent in its industry, is about as far ahead in efficiency
compared to its competitors as General Motors is ahead in the automobile
industry.</p>
<p>What then is the essence of these success stories? What do the
Japanese, Zeiss, and IBM do that the rest of us do not do, and what do
they not do that the rest of us do?</p>
<p>Neither the Japanese, nor Zeiss, nor IBM practice “permissive
management.” Man- agement in Japan is notoriously autocratic. No one has
ever mistaken an order by a Japa- nese company president for a polite
request. Abbé, according to all reports, was not per- missive either.
While a kind man by all accounts, he was very much the German “Herr
Professor” and was used to unquestioned authority. Thomas Watson,
Sr. was a tyrant. Abbé and Watson demanded excellence in performance and
did not accept good inten- tions as a substitute.</p>
<p>These are not examples of “democratic management,” let alone of
“participatory de- mocracy.” There is no doubt in a Japanese company who
is boss. Neither Abbe nor Tho- mas Watson, Sr., was in the least
reluctant to make decisions by fiat.</p>
<p>Neither the Japanese, nor Zeiss, nor IBM have much use for
“free-form” organization.</p>
<p>The typical Japanese company is tightly structured, with formal lines
of command clearly drawn and meticulously observed. So was Abbé’s Zeiss
and Watson’s IBM.</p>
<p>These success stories in managing working and worker exemplify
something far more important than any current ism. Most theories of
managing working and worker— including such present cure-alls as
“permissiveness” or “participatory democracy”—are concerned with
organizing authority. The Japanese, Abbé at Zeiss, and Thomas Watson,
Sr., at IBM based managing working and work on organizing
responsibility.</p>
