<h4 id="the-spirit-of-performance">36 The Spirit of Performance</h4>
<p>To Make Common Men Do Uncommon Things—The Test Is Performance, Not
Good Feelings—Focus on Strength—Practices, Not Preachments—The Danger of
Safe Me- diocrity—What “Performance” Means—What to Do with the
Nonperformer— “Con- science” Decisions—Focus on Opportunity— “People”
Decisions: The Control of an Organization—Integrity, the Touchstone</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>HE PURPOSE OF AN ORGANIZATION is to enable common men to do uncom-
mon things.</p>
<p>tion is the spirit of performance.</p>
<p>cannot do.</p>
<p>“Morale” in an organization does not mean that “people get along
together”; the test is performance, not conformance. Human relations
that are not grounded in the satisfaction of good performance in work
are actually poor human relations and result in a mean spirit. And there
is no greater indictment of an organization than that the strength and
ability of the outstanding man become a threat to the group and his
performance a source of difficulty, frustration, and discouragement for
the others.</p>
<p>Spirit of performance in a human organization means that its energy
output is larger than the sum of the efforts put in. It means the
creation of energy. This cannot be accom- plished by mechanical means. A
mechanical contrivance can, at its theoretical best, con- serve energy,
but it cannot create it. To get out more than is being put in is
possible only in the moral sphere.</p>
<p>Morality does not mean preachments. Morality, to have any meaning at
all, must be a principle of action. It must not be exhortation, sermon,
or good intentions. It must be practices. Specifically:</p>
<p>1 The focus of the organization must be on performance. The first
requirement of the spirit of organization is high performance standards,
for the group as well as for each individual. The organization must
inculcate in itself the habit of achievement.</p>
<p>But performance does not mean “success every time.” Performance is
rather a “batting average.” It will, indeed it must, have room for
mistakes and even for failures. What performance has no ronm for is
complacency and low standards.</p>
<p>2 The focus of the organization must be on opportunities rather than
on prob- lems.</p>
<p>3 The decisions that affect people: their placement and their pay,
promotion, demotion and severance, must express the values and beliefs
of the organiza-</p>
<p>tion. They are the true controls of an organization.</p>
<p>he has to bring with him and cannot be expected to acquire later on.
And management must demonstrate that it requires the same integrity of
itself.</p>
<p>The Danger of Safe Mediocrity</p>
<p>The constant temptation of every organization is safe mediocrity. The
first requirement of organizational health is a high demand on
performance. Indeed, one of the major reasons for demanding that
management be by objectives and that it focus on the objective re-
quirements of the task is the need to have managers set high standards
of performance for themselves.</p>
<p>This requires that performance be understood properly. Performance is
not hitting the bull’s-eye with every shot—that is a circus act that can
be maintained only over a few minutes. Performance is rather the
consistent ability to produce results over prolonged periods of time and
in a variety of assignments. A performance record must include mis-
takes. It must include failures. It must reveal a man’s limitations as
well as his strengths. And there are as many different kinds of
performance as there are different human beings. One man will
consistently do well, rarely falling far below a respectable standard,
but also rarely excel through brilliance or virtuosity. Another man will
perform only adequately under normal circumstances but will rise to the
demands of a crisis or a major challenge and then perform like a true
“star.” Both are “performers.” Both need to be recognized. But their
performances will look quite different.</p>
<p>The one man to distrust, however, is the man who never makes a
mistake, never com- mits a blunder never fails in what he tries to do.
He is either a phony, or he stays with the safe, the tried, and the
trivial.</p>
<p>A management which does not define performance as a batting average
is a manage- ment that mistakes conformity for achievement, and absence
of weaknesses for strengths. It is a management that discourages and
demoralizes its organization. The better a man is, the more mistakes he
will make—for the more new things he will try.</p>
<p>The man who consistently renders poor or mediocre performance should
be removed from his job for his own good. People who find themselves in
a job that exceeds their capacities are frustrated, harassed,
anxiety-ridden people. One does not do a man a ser- vice by leaving him
in a job he is not equal to. Not to face up to man’s failure in a job is
cowardice rather than compassion.</p>
<p>One also owes it to the man’s subordinates who have a right to be
managed with com- petence, dedication, and achievement. Subordinates
have a right to a boss who performs, for otherwise they themselves
cannot perform.</p>
<p>One owes it finally to all the people in the organization not to put
up with a manager who fails to perform. The entire organization is
diminished by the manager or career pro- fessional who performs poorly
or not at all. It is enriched by the man who performs su- perbly.</p>
<p>At first sight the Japanese seem to violate this rule. For few, if
any, people ever get fired for nonperformance in the Japanese
organization. In actuality the Japanese organiza- tion may be as
demanding and even as competitive as any in the West. The poor or me-
diocre performer is not fired; but he is quickly sidetracked and
assigned the activities which are in effect “made work.” And both he and
the organization know it. Moreover, while everyone advances in pay and
title according to seniority, there is a day of reckon- ing at or around
age forty-five when the very few who will become company directors;</p>
<p>that is, top management, are chosen from the many others who will,
ten years later, retire as section managers or department directors.</p>
<p>The only thing that is proven by a man’s not performing in a given
assignment is that management has made a mistake by putting him in. It
is a mistake that no manager can avoid, no matter how carefully he works
on the placement of people. The fact that a man who has performed in
earlier assignments does not perform in a new one proves nothing except
that he should not have been put in the job in the first place.</p>
<p>“Failure” in such a case may mean only that a first-rate career
professional has been miscast as a manager. It may mean that a man
excellent at running an existing operation has been miscast as an
innovator and entrepreneur. Or it may mean the opposite: that a man
whose strength lies in doing new and different things has been miscast
to head a con- tinuing, well-established, and highly routinized
operation.</p>
<p>Failure to perform on the part of a man who has a record of proven
performance is a signal to think hard about the man and the job. And
sometimes, of course (see the discus- sion of the “widow-maker” job in
Chapter 32) it is the job rather than the man that is at fault.</p>
<p>George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in World War II,
was an uncom- promising and exacting boss who refused to tolerate
mediocrity, let alone failure. “I have a duty to the soldiers, their
parents, and the country, to remove immediately any com- mander who does
net satisfy the highest performance demands,” Marshall said again and
again. But he always asserted, “It was my mistake to have put this or
that man in a com- mand that was not the right command for him. It is
therefore my job to think through where he belongs.” Many of the men who
emerged in World War II as highly successful commanders in the U.S. Army
were once in the course of their careers removed by Mar- shall from an
early assignment. But then Marshall thought through the mistake he had
made—and tried, to figure out where that man belonged. And this
explains, an large measure, why the American Army, which had gone into
World War II without a single one of its future general officers yet in
a command position (these were all held by men past retirement age who
had to be moved out), produced an outstanding group of leaders in a few
short years.</p>
<p>“Conscience” Decisions</p>
<p>The toughest cases, but also the most important ones, are those of
people who have given long and loyal service to the company but who have
outlived their capacity to contribute.</p>
<p>There is, for instance, the bookkeeper who started when the company
was in its in- fancy and grew with it until, at age fifty or so, he
finds himself controller of large com- pany and totally out of his
depth. The man has not changed—the demands of the job have. He has given
faithful service. And where loyalty has been received, loyalty is due.
But still, he must not be allowed to remain as controller. Not only does
his inability to perform endanger the company, his inadequacy
demoralizes the entire management group and discredits management
altogether.</p>
<p>These cases—fortunately not too numerous—challenge the conscience of
an organiza- tion. To keep the man in his job would be betrayal of the
enterprise and of all its people. But to fire a man who has given thirty
years of faithful service is also betraying a trust. And to say, “We
should have taken care of this twenty-five years ago,” while true, is
not much help.</p>
<p>The decision in such cases must be objective, that is, focused on the
good of the com- pany: the man must be removed from his job. Yet the
decision is also a human decision which requires utmost consideration,
true compassion, and an acceptance of obligations. That Henry Ford II
could revive the moribund Ford Motor Company after World War II was in
large measure the result of his understanding the crucial importance of
these “con- science cases.”</p>
<p>At that time, none of the nine management people in one key division
was found to be competent to take on the new jobs created in the course
of reorganization. Not one was</p>
<p>appointed to these new jobs. Yet, for these nine men, jobs as
technicians and experts were found within the organization, jobs which
they could be expected to perform. It would have been easy to fire them.
Their incompetence as managers was undisputed. But they had also served
loyally through very trying years. Henry Ford II took the line that no
one should be allowed to hold a job without giving superior performance
but also laid down that no one should be penalized for the mistakes of
the previous regime. And to the strict observance of this rule the
company owes to a considerable extent its rapid revival. (Inci-
dentally, seven of these men did indeed perform in their new jobs—one so
well that he was later promoted into a bigger job than the one he
originally held. Two men failed; the older one was pensioned off, the
younger one discharged.)</p>
<p>The frequent excuse in a conscience case, “We can’t move him; he has
been here too long to be fired,” is bad logic and rarely more than a
weak-kneed alibi. It does harm to the performance of management people,
to their spirit, and to their respect for the company.</p>
<p>But to fire such a man is equally bad. It violates the organization’s
sense of justice and decency. It shakes its faith in the integrity of
management. “Here, but for the grace of God, go I,” is what everybody
will say—even though he would be the first to criticize if management
left an incompetent in a position of importance.</p>
<p>A management that is concerned with the spirit of the organization
therefore takes these cases exceedingly seriously. They are not too
common, as a rule—or at least, they should not be. But they have impact
on the spirit of the organization way beyond their numbers. How they are
handled will tell the organization both whether management takes itself
and its job seriously, and whether it takes the human being
seriously.</p>
<p>Focus on Opportunity</p>
<p>An organization will have a high spirit of performance if it is
consistently directed toward opportunity rather than toward problems. It
will have the thrill of excitement, the sense of challenge, and the
satisfaction of achievement if its energies are put where the results
are, and that means on the opportunities.*</p>
<p>Of course, problems cannot be neglected. But the problem-focused
organization is an organization on the defensive. It is an organization
that forever considers yesterday to have been the golden age. It is an
organization that feels that it has performed well if things do not get
worse.</p>
<p>A management that wants to create and maintain the spirit of
achievement in its com- pany therefore stresses opportunity. But it will
also demand that opportunities be con- verted into results.</p>
<p>formance and work plan.</p>
<p>“People” Decisions—The Control of an Organization</p>
<p>An organization that wants to build a high spirit of performance
recognizes that “people” decisions—on placement and on pay, on
promotion, demotion, and firing—are the true “control” of an
organization. They, far more than the accountant’s figures and reports,
model and mold behavior. For the people decision signals to every member
of the organi- zation what it is that management really wants, really
values, really rewards.</p>
<p>The company which preaches “our first-line supervisors are expected
to practice hu- man relations” and which then, every time, promotes the
supervisor who gets his paper- work in on time and neatly done, will not
get “human relations.” Even the dumbest fore- man will learn very soon
that what the company really wants is neat paperwork.</p>
<p>*On the opportunity focus, see also my book, Managing for
Results.</p>
<p>Indeed an organization tends to overreact to the people decisions of
management.</p>
<p>What to top management may look like an innocuous compromise to
remove an obstacle or to solve a political impasse may well be a clear
signal to the organization that man- agement wants one kind of behavior
while preaching another.</p>
<p>Placement and promotion are the most crucial people decisions. They,
above all, re- quire careful thinking and clear policy and procedures
which live up to high standards of fairness and equity. They should
never be made on the basis of opinions and on a man’s “potential.” They
should always be based on a factual record of performance against ex-
plicit goals and objectives.</p>
<p>But the best placement and promotion procedures do not insure by
themselves that these crucial decisions fortify and build the spirit of
the organization rather than impair it. For this, top management must
build itself into the promotion process. Above all, it must make sure
that it participates in the key decisions on promotion, the decisions
which, in effect, spell out to the organization what management’s values
and beliefs really are and at the same time determine—often
irrevocably—the top management or tomorrow.</p>
<p>All top managements take an active role in the decisions on promotion
to the jobs di- rectly below or in the top-management group: the
promotion into position of general manager of major divisions or into
position as the head of major functional areas, such as manufacturing or
marketing. But few top managements, especially in larger businesses,
take much interest in the promotion decisions just below the top group,
that is, into such jobs as head of market research, plant manager, head
of pharmacology in the research lab, or even marketing manager of a
division. They leave these decisions to the top people in the respective
functions or divisions. Yet these upper-middle-management jobs are truly
the management to the organization. People further down, and especially
the younger managers and career professionals, know very well that their
own careers depend on these upper-middle people rather than on the big
boss. And it is the decision whom to put into one of these upper-middle
spots which in effect decides who, a few years hence, will be eligible
for a top-management assignment.</p>
<p>Above all, these promotional decisions have the highest symbolical
value. They are highly “visible” and signal to the entire organization,
“This is what this company wants, rewards, recognizes.” For this reason,
old and experienced organizations, such as the Army and the Catholic
Church, put their main concern with promotion on upper-middle
management—in the Army on promotion to the colonelcy, and in the
Catholic Church on selecting an auxiliary bishop.</p>
<p>It would be wise for top management to learn from these examples. It
is well worth top management’s time to take an active part in the
promotions to the levels which for the organization mean management.</p>
<p>Integrity, the Touchstone</p>
<p>The final proof of the sincerity and seriousness of a management is
uncompromising em- phasis on integrity of character. This, above all,
has to be symbolized in management’s “people” decisions. For it is
character through which leadership is exercised; it is charac- ter that
sets the example and is imitated. Character is not something a man can
acquire; if he does not bring it to the job, he will never have it. It
is not something one can fool peo- ple about. The men with whom a man
works, and especially his subordinates, know in a few weeks whether he
has integrity or not. They may forgive a man a great deal: incompe-
tence, ignorance, insecurity, or bad manners. But they will not forgive
his lack of integ- rity. Nor will they forgive higher management for
choosing him.</p>
<p>Integrity may be difficult to define, but what constitutes lack of
integrity of such seri- ousness as to disqualify a man for a managerial
position is not. A man should never be appointed to a managerial
position if his vision focuses on people’s weaknesses rather than on
their strengths. The man who always knows exactly what people cannot do,
but never sees anything they can do, will undermine the spirit of his
organization. Of course, a manager should have a clear grasp of the
limitations of his people, but he should see these</p>
<p>as limitation’s or what they can do, and as challenges to them to do
better. He should be a realist; and no one is less realistic than the
cynic.</p>
<p>A man should not be appointed if he is more interested in the
question “Who is right?”</p>
<p>than in the question “What is right?” To put personality above the
requirements of the work is corruption and corrupts. To ask “Who is
right?” encourages one’s subordinates to play safe, if not to play
politics. Above all, it encourages them to “cover up” rather than to
take corrective action as soon as they find out that they have made a
mistake.</p>
<p>Management should not appoint a man who considers intelligence more
important than integrity. This is immaturity—and usually incurable. It
should never promote a man who has shown that he is afraid of strong
subordinates. This is weakness. It should never put into a management
job a man who does not set high standards for his own work. For that
breeds contempt for the work and for management’s competence.</p>
<p>A man might himself know too little, perform poorly, lack judgment
and ability, and yet not do too much damage as a manager. But if he
lacks in character and integrity—no matter how knowledgeable, how
brilliant, how successful—he destroys. He destroys peo- ple, the most
valuable resource of the enterprise. He destroys spirit. And he destroys
per- formance.</p>
<p>This is particularly true of the people at the head of an enterprise.
For the spirit of an organization is created from the top. If an
organization is great in spirit, it is because the spirit of its top
people is great. If it decays, it does so because the top rots; as the
proverb has it, “Trees die from the top.” No one should ever be
appointed to a senior position unless top management is willing to have
his character serve as the model for his subordi- nates.</p>
<p>This chapter has talked of “practices.” It has not talked of
“leadership.” This was in- tentional. There is no substitute for
leadership. But management cannot create leaders. It can only create the
conditions under which potential leadership qualities become effec-
tive; or it can stifle potential leadership. The supply of leadership is
much too uncertain to be depended upon for the creation of the spirit
the enterprise needs to be productive and to hold together.</p>
<p>But practices, though seemingly humdrum, can always be practiced
whatever a man’s aptitudes, personality, or attitudes. They require no
genius—only application. They are things to do rather than to talk
about.</p>
<p>And the right practices should go a long way toward bringing out,
recognizing, and using whatever potential for leadership there is in the
management group. They should also lay the foundation for the right kind
of leadership. For leadership is not magnetic personality—that can just
as well be demagoguery. It is not “making friends and influenc- ing
people”—that is flattery. Leadership is the lifting of a man’s vision to
higher sights, the raising of a man’s performance to a higher standard,
the building of a man’s personal- ity beyond its normal limitations.
Nothing better prepares the ground for such leadership than a spirit of
management that confirms in the day-to-day practices of the organization
strict principles of conduct and responsibility, high standards of
performance, and respect for the individual and his work.</p>
