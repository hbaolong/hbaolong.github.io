<p>Managing Successful Diversification—What to Do with the “Misfit”?—The
Tempta- tion of the “Partial Fit”—The Four Tools of
Diversification—Grassroots Develop- ment vs. Acquisition—The Question of
Temperament—The Difference in Approach— What Contribution Can We Make?
—Grassroots-Acquisition Strategy—Divestment of the Misfit: A Marketing
Problem—Joint Venture—The Various Kinds—The Ground Rules—The Danger of
Success—Who Shall Manage?—When Joint Ventures No Longer Make Sense—A
Note on the Family Business</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>VEN THE MOST SOUNDLY BASED diversification strategy cannot avoid an
casional “misfit.” It is, after all, not truly predictable whether
extension either of</p>
<p>oc-</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>market or of the technology will “fit.” And there are bound to be
occasional “partial fits”—diversifications that are successful but
exceed a company’s ability to manage, or diversifications that might be
successful if only the company could do something it cannot or should
not do.</p>
<p>Managing diversification requires that one knows what to do if a
product, service, or business that looked like a logical extension of
one’s own market turns out not to belong in that market, e.g., because
the consumer defines the market differently from the way the producer
does. It requires knowing what to do with developments that come, so to
speak, organically, out of one’s own business or technology but do not
fit into a frame of com- mon unity. The development may be too promising
to be given up. Yet to try to fit it within one’s business structure is
likely to create splintering and to diffuse. Managing diversification
requires that one know what to do if a business that has had original
unity finds its technology branching increasingly into different
directions that have less and less in common with one another. Sometimes
it is the most successful new development that turns out to go out of
bounds and to threaten, by its very success, to make the whole com- pany
unmanageable.</p>
<p>What every management would like to hear is that it can have its cake
and eat it too, that is, that it can hold on to the misfit and yet
somehow continue to have a manageable and performing business.
Unfortunately, this is unlikely to happen. Managements that attempt this
feat will soon find themselves in the proverbial position of the bird
that has hatched the cuckoo’s egg. The changeling in the nest will end
up by pushing out the le- gitimate brood.</p>
<p>If the misfit is a failure, the course of action is clear: one gets
rid of it, one way or an- other.</p>
<p>But what about the misfit that, viewed by itself, is highly promising
or even apparently successful?</p>
<p>The classic case is GM’s development, in the twenties, of tetraethyl
lead to cure the “knocking” problem of the gasoline engine. This was not
only a scientific achievement. It also was a business achievement. For
“knocking” was a major obstacle to consumer ac- ceptance of the
high-performing but economical automobile on which Sloan had based</p>
<p>GM’s entire strategy. Yet tetraethyl lead was clearly a misfit for
GM. It was a chemical product, rather than a mechanical one. And it had
to go to market as part of the gasoline and thus required a gasoline
distribution system.</p>
<p>The legend persists at GM that the developers of tetraethyl lead
proposed that GM buy a fair-sized oil company and its gas stations to
market tetraethy1 lead. But Sloan was wiser. Instead he teamed up in a
joint venture—Ethyl Corporation—with Standard Oil of New Jersey, which
had the distribution system. This produced more profit for GM than even
owning a large oil company could have yielded. Instead of being a
competitor to the large oil companies, Ethyl became their supplier
worldwide. GM, in effect, made money on almost every gallon of gasoline
sold anyplace by anyone. Yet it not only had a minimal capital
investment. It maintained the essential unity and manageability of GM.
Ethyl was a separate business under its own management of chemical
engineers and chemical mar- keters.</p>
<p>The joint venture is, of course, only one way to handle the promising
or successful misfit. But whatever the way chosen—joint venture,
outright sale, licensing, or spin-off into a separate business—the way
should always lead to a clear managerial divorce. If the misfit is to
succeed, it requires its own management. For what makes it a misfit is
that it does not fall into the market unity or technological unity which
the company’s manage- ment knows, understands, can manage. In turn, the
misfit, if promising or successful, needs its own management—and
deserves it.</p>
<p>Misfits like tetraethyl lead are comparatively rare. Far more common
are “partial fits.”</p>
<p>The usual case is the new product or technology that does not fit
because its success de- mands its own market and its own customers, but
which also constitutes an important supply to the originating business
or an important customer for one of its own products.</p>
<p>GM had a need for tetraethyl lead to be available to its customers.
Yet not one drop of the stuff went into a GM product. The situation was
quite different with respect to the— equally sizable—achievement in
chemical technology mentioned in the preceding chap- ter: the
development of a whole family of new plastic compounds by one of the
major electrical manufacturers. These new plastics promised to have uses
across a very wide range of industries and products. Indeed, without
such large markets the research and capital investment required would
have been uneconomical. Something like 90 or 95 per- cent of their
potential markets lay totally outside the originating company’s
business. But something like 5 to 10 percent—and of course the most
immediately realizable 5 to 10 percent—of the market was in their use as
components for some of the company’s own products. The company decided
to develop the new chemicals itself. But while the new technology has
been a major success, the company did not reap the harvest—chemical
companies did who very rapidly ran around the inventor’s original
patents. It would have been better—for the company and for its promising
“child”—if the new technology had been licensed out or at least been
made the basis for a joint venture with a major chemical producer.</p>
<p>If the new development that requires diversification is a product or
service which promises to provide a profitable and new access to market
for an existing product or ser- vice, that is, if it promises to become
an important customer, one asks, “Is the contribu- tion our product, our
service, our market makes to the new development the essential, the
central contribution? Or is it incidental?” If the former, then it is
likely to be sound and manageable. If the latter, the new development
better be on its own.</p>
<p>The partial fit is the most dangerous temptation in diversification.
The half-understood is always more dangerous than the totally unknown;
it is only too easy to deceive oneself into believing that one really
understands it. It is also so easy to deceive oneself into be- lieving
that one can really make a crucial contribution to its development and
success. But what one does not understand about it is likely to turn out
to be critical, if not decisive.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical companies that went into perfumes and cosmetics
all believed that their chemical and compounding knowledge would be a
major contribution. But the key to perfumes and cosmetics is
fashion—marketing, promotion, and image-creation—all three well beyond
the ken, let alone the values, of a pharmaceutical manufacturer.</p>
<p>Whether contemplating diversification, or managing diversification
that has already become part of the business, top management should
always start out with the question of the successful pharmaceutical
company reported in the preceding chapter: “Could this product, process,
service, technology, or market fit better elsewhere?” If the answer is
yes—or even if it is only “maybe”—one asks, “What would we have to be
able to do to make it fit our business—and how likely are we to learn
it?” One also asks, “What would be the most desirable divorce—desirable
for us and for the misfit or partial fit?”</p>
<p>Diversification that results in misfits or partial fits, that is,
diversification that damages or destroys a company’s core of unity, is
another form of being, or becoming, a business of the wrong size. The
very least that is required is that it not be allowed to endanger
managerial unity, managerial clarity, and managerial concentration on
one’s own business and its opportunities. The minimum action is setting
up such a partial fit as a fully sepa- rate though wholly-owned
business. At least one no longer manages the partial fit. This is,
however, an investment decision. As such it should always be judged by
the same crite- rion as any other decision to invest outside of one’s
own business: “Is this the best in- vestment of the capital available to
us?” Otherwise, it is splintering of scarce resources.</p>
<p>And if not the best—or a very good—investment opportunity,
divestment, either in whole or in part—sale, licensing, or joint
venture—is preferable. This will not only bring greater direct returns.
Freeing management for what it can and should do is likely to bring even
greater indirect results.</p>
<p>The Tools of Diversification</p>
<p>To manage diversification, management has available four tools. Two
are tools to diver- sify: development from the beginning (often called
“grass-roots development”) and acqui- sition. One is a tool to cure
unsound diversification: divestment of misfit or partial fit. One is a
tool both to diversify and to get out of unsound diversification: the
joint venture.</p>
<p>Grass-roots development and acquisition as royal roads to
diversification and growth each have vocal partisans. But it is not
either/or. These are alternatives; and for one im- portant problem,
these two are complements.</p>
<p>It is often said that acquisitions cost more money than grass-roots
developments, but telescope time. This is not necessarily true. Many
grass-roots developments cost more money than acquisition would have
required. At the same time, many acquisitions take longer to produce
results than an energetically pursued grass-roots venture.</p>
<p>One rarely can buy an exact fit whether in markets, products, or
people. To make an acquisition truly serve the purpose for which it was
made may take a long time. Until then it is unlikely to produce the
results it was purchased for.</p>
<p>It is often said that an acquisition, while more expensive than
grass-roots develop- ment, is less risky. This is not true either. The
proportion of acquisitions that turn out to be expensive mistakes or at
least disappointments, is substantial. I would put it close to 50
percent. And while the failure rate of grass-roots development is
higher—perhaps two- thirds—most of them can be recognized as mistakes
and liquidated early, before the in- vestment has become
substantial.</p>
<p>One can never be sure of a grass-roots development, it is said. There
are always sur- prises—and few of them are pleasant surprises, true. But
I have never seen an acquisition or heard of one in which there were not
unpleasant surprises too. Indeed, the one absolute certainty in
acquisitions is that the day after the contract has been signed,
skeletons of all sizes and shapes start tumbling out of all kinds of
cupboards.</p>
<p>What is true is that grass-roots development and acquisition require
different ap- proaches and different temperaments, pose and require
different questions, and run into different kinds of problems. Both have
in common, however, that they must be grounded in a diversification
strategy. “We want to grow, let’s do something different,” is unlikely
to produce results in either approach. “What is our business and what
should it be?” is the starting point for both successful diversification
from the grass roots and successful diver- sification through
acquisition.</p>
<p>But thereafter the two differ in essentials. They are indeed so
different that few com- panies are likely to do well in both grass-roots
development and acquisitions. A company that is constantly “unlucky”
with acquisitions should stop making them. It is not unlucky. It lacks
the temperament for making them. It is not prepared for the
difficulties, troubles, and problems which inevitably follow the most
harmonious and most logical acquisition. Similarly, a company that is
consistently “unlucky” with grass-roots development is not unlucky. It
does not understand the problems of the new and the growing. It does not
have the innovative capacity (on this, see Chapter 61). Neither company
will find it easy to acquire what it lacks.</p>
<p>The two American companies that exemplify this—and that also seem to
understand this—are General Motors and General Electric. GM has not for
decades developed any- thing from the ground up. But GM has an enviable
record for developing into star per- formers successful businesses it
acquires, such as the small and quite successful diesel manufacturer
which GM developed in a few years into the Electromotive Division and
the giant of the railroad locomotive business. GE, on the other hand,
has not done particularly well with any acquisition since its early
days. But it has a highly successful record as a developer of new
successful businesses out of technical or market innovations.</p>
<p>Every management needs to be able to do one or the other: grass-roots
development or acquisition. For each company, or at least each company
beyond small size, may need to diversify. But a management also needs to
know which of these two tools of diversifica- tion fits its temperament,
its way of doing things, its abilities. And then it should probably work
at what it can do and finds congenial. It is better to have great skill
and strength in one hand than to be ambidextrous but skilled in neither
hand.</p>
<p>The basic approaches to grass-roots development and to acquisition
are different to begin with. In deciding to initiate or to go ahead with
a grass roots development the key question is “What can it contribute to
us? What new capability, what new strength, what new market or
technology does it promise to produce for us? And altogether what will
it do for us?”</p>
<p>But in acquisition the key question is always “What contribution can
we make to the new acquisition?” Unless the acquiring company can make a
contribution that signifi- cantly raises the capacity of the acquired
business to perform and to produce results, it is unlikely to be a
successful acquisition.</p>
<p>It is because GM has, it appears, always understood this that it has
been so successful with the businesses it bought. But one need not be a
giant like GM to have a successful acquisition strategy based on the
question “What can we contribute?”</p>
<p>A company in the American Midwest has grown in fifteen years from
tiny to fair—and almost big-size, and to outstanding profitability, by
an acquisition strategy based on care- ful analysis of what it can
contribute. All the company’s businesses make parts and sup- plies for
manufactured products, either mechanical or electronic. And the company
does have substantial manufacturing ability. But it sees itself
primarily as an industrial mar- keter with proven ability to build
market and distribution for industrial products. It con- stantly looks
for successful small to medium-sized companies which have engineering
and manufacturing leadership in products of this kind but which are
being run as manufactur- ing, rather than as marketing businesses. When
it finds such a company it proposes a joint study to the company’s
management. If the study shows to the satisfaction of management in both
companies that a systematic marketing approach would indeed result in
substantial increases, an acquisition bid is made—usually, at a generous
price. So far, every such bid has been accepted. And in all but one of
the eleven acquisitions the company made within fifteen years results
have come up to the expectations, usually within a fairly short
time.</p>
<p>There is one compelling reason for basing an acquisition on one’s
ability to make a contribution. One cannot take for granted that the
management of the acquisition will stay—even if one wants it to stay.
The odds, based on experience, are strongly against its staying on. And
when the acquiring company has to provide management—and the time for
this is usually when there is trouble—one better lead from strength and
be able to con- tribute what the acquisition needs.</p>
<p>That this is not usually a problem in grass-roots development is the
strongest argument for it. There one can acquire in the course of the
development what abilities, skills, com- petences are needed. One can
learn. In an acquisition one has to possess these abilities,</p>
<p>skills, and competences when one goes in.</p>
<p>The “Grass-Roots-for-Acquisition” Strategy</p>
<p>New Deal legislation in the thirties split into two the banking firm
of J.P. Morgan and Co. One of the two parts, Morgan Stanley, took over
underwriting and venture banking—that is, the areas in which the
original firm had been pre-eminent. The firm that continued un- der the
original name inherited commercial banking, which had been little more
than a sideline. The new J.P. Morgan andandandand Co. had the name. It
had the clientele of the country’s biggest businesses. But it lacked the
deposit base to be a major factor in commercial banking. It also lacked
commercial banking knowledge. And it lacked seasoned commer- cial
bankers. Everybody expected J.P. Morgan to drift into well-heeled
oblivion. But not much more than a decade after the split-up J.P. Morgan
took over the Guaranty Trust Company, which, while one of the country’s
oldest and largest commercial banks, had also become one of the
sleepiest. The new Morgan Guaranty Trust Company at once be- came
aggressive and energetic and emerged as New York’s leading “big
business” bank. Though it has only a handful of branches—each a very big
bank in itself—it now ranks fourth among New York banks in deposits and
ranks much higher in trust and investment business. This was brought
about by deliberate diversification strategy which practiced grass-roots
development to make possible successful acquisition.</p>
<p>It seems plausible that Henry Alexander, the Morgan partner who
headed the com- mercial-banking torso after the split-up, realized that
his firm was the wrong size for suc- cessful commercial banking. He
lacked the deposit base. He also probably realized that this could not
be cured by growth, but only by merger or acquisition. He certainly must
have realized that he lacked the strength to make a major contribution
to an acquisition. He therefore went in for systematic grass-roots
development. Specifically, he brought in a fairly large number of bright
young men and trained them in commercial banking. There was much joking
in New York banking circles in those years about “Alexander’s Kinder-
garten.” But when Alexander finally moved and took over Guaranty Trust
he could fill every key spot in a bank ten times as large as his own
with an experienced, seasoned Morgan executive, and could revitalize
every key activity with new but carefully tested ideas and policies.</p>
<p>Precisely because the key to successful acquisition is the
contribution the acquiring company can make to the business it acquires,
grass-roots development can provide the foundation for acquisition. And
because a grassroots development often runs into an “awkward stage,” or
“wrong size” where it needs to make a quantum jump—to a bigger
distribution system, a bigger deposit base, or a broader
technology—acquisition is often the best way to make productive a
grass-roots development. But this requires first the rare ability to
perform both grass-roots development and acquisition. It requires
purposeful business strategy even more.</p>
<p>Divestment of the Misfit</p>
<p>The unsuccessful misfit of diversification should be put out of its
misery as fast as possi- ble. Otherwise it becomes a drain on a
company’s resources and a crushing burden on its management. A
diversification strategy—whether pursued through grass-roots develop-
ment or through acquisition—needs a systematic and purposeful policy for
abandoning the misfit. The successful misfit or partial fit should not
be let go. But it should be moved out of the managerial system. It
should be divested.</p>
<p>Sears has done this with the most successful of the manufacturing
companies it owned and developed: Whirlpool. As long as Whirlpool’s
entire output of appliances was bought and distributed by Sears, Sears
owned the company. When it was then decided that Whirlpool would also
sell appliances directly to the public under its own brand name,</p>
<p>Sears took the company public and retained only a controlling
majority interest in it. And gradually Sears has sold off its Whirlpool
shares as the company grew and prospered.</p>
<p>One reason for this strategy is that a growing and successful
business both needs capi- tal and can obtain it itself. But such a
business also needs genuine managerial independ- ence. It is unlikely
that it will realize its full potential if dominated by another manage-
ment whose interests, vision, and preoccupations are—and should
be—focused on its own business. Such a business is no longer a “child”
but an “adult.” And adults do better standing on their own two feet.</p>
<p>Whirlpool is still the sole supplier of major appliances for Sears.
It has indeed taken over supplying a lot of additional appliances for
Sears, e.g., home heating furnaces. It was, until 1972, managed at the
top by former Sears executives. But the growth that has made it the
hundredth largest company among U.S. industrial corporations has
primarily been in sales directly to the consumer, through its own
dealers and under its own brand name. It began only after Sears had
ceased to be in control. And it was financed directly in the capital and
credit markets.</p>
<p>For the majority of successful misfits or partial fits financial as
well as managerial di- vorce is the right thing from the start. Like
grown children, they need their own “home.”</p>
<p>Divestment is a “marketing” rather than a “selling” problem. The
question is not “What do we want to sell and for how much?” It is “For
whom is this venture ‘value’ and under what conditions?” It is, of
course, a financial transaction. But the salient point is finding the
potential buyer for whom what is misfit to the seller is perfect fit,
the buyer to whom the venture to be sold offers the best opportunity or
solves the worst problem. This is then also the buyer who will pay the
most.</p>
<p>A major printing company decided that a mass-circulation magazine it
owned was at best a partial fit and should be sold. The magazine had
been bought originally to hold its printing contract. Then it had been
in difficulties. Under the printing company’s manage- ment it had been
turned around and was now moderately successful. But the printing
company executives knew that it required new directions and new
strategy. They them- selves neither were, nor intended to become,
publishing experts. Indeed they had con- cluded that they already spent
far too much of their time on a business which they did not really
understand. What the magazine needed, they realized, was publishing
management of a high order. Then they asked, “What is value to a
magazine publishing company?” “If it is a growing magazine company,”
they answered, “its greatest need is cash. For a grow- ing magazine
requires heavy cash investments in building circulation for several
years.” “How can we supply this need of the potential buyer to our own
advantage?” was the next question. And the answer was, “By giving him
ninety days rather than the customary thirty days to pay his print and
paper bill to our printing plants.” For next to investment in
circulation, printing and paper make the largest cash demands on a
magazine. The print- ing company then rapidly found a publishing group
that filled their requirements. The group gladly bought the magazine,
paying more for it than the seller had expected to get. They could,
however, well afford to do so. By getting cash financing for their own
needs, they still came out with substantial cost advantages. The seller
almost doubled what to him mattered most: his magazine printing
business, as he got the printing contracts for the buyer’s other
magazines. He did so at minimal risk. And within two years the buyers
had increased the magazine’s circulation and advertising revenues by 50
percent.</p>
<p>“In looking for a husband for your daughter,” says an old proverb,
“don’t ask: ‘Who’ll make the best husband for her?’ ask instead: ‘For
which kind of a man would she make a good wife?’ “ This is the right
rule for the divestment of a successful or promising misfit or partial
fit.</p>
<p>The Joint Venture</p>
<p>The joint venture is the most flexible instrument for making fits out
of misfits. It will be- come increasingly important. It is at the same
time the most demanding and difficult of all tools of
diversification—and the least understood.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of joint ventures, each of which serves
different purposes and has different characteristics. There is, first,
the joint venture in which the strengths of two different and
independent businesses are pooled together in a jointly owned new
business. Each parent contributes what he can do. The resulting whole
is—and should be—different from the sum of its constituent parts.</p>
<p>The Ethyl Corporation was an early example. A more recent and much
smaller one is the joint venture set up in 1972 by BOAC, a major
airline, and Leasco, a computer- leasing company, to supply to smaller
airlines a reservations system for airline travelers. This venture
combines the programs and process data which BOAC has developed for its
own reservation needs with the computer expertise and the financing
capability of a major computer-leasing company. BOAC saw the opportunity
of converting a cost center into a profit center. But it also realized
that except as a joint venture, that is, as an independent company, this
would be the wrong diversification. It would require the financial
strength which BOAC does not have. And it would detract from BOAC’s own
efforts to run its own business in a highly competitive industry.</p>
<p>The second kind of joint venture attempts to make a viable whole out
of several mis- fits which by themselves cannot survive. It attempts to
provide a quantum jump from the wrong size to the right size, and from
the nonviable to the viable. Here all partners make essentially the same
contribution, though in varying proportions. The whole, however, should
be greater than the sum of its parts—simply because by itself each part
is well be- low the threshold of effectiveness. One might call this
“aggregation by joint venture.”</p>
<p>Here belong the “consortium” banks that have been formed, mostly in
London, in the late sixties and early seventies, to engage in
medium-term lending. The partners are major European banks, American
banks, and in some cases Japanese and even Latin American banks. The
banks are all big and powerful in their own right. But none of them has
the financial strength and, above all, the market to develop a
medium-term loan business that could compete with American giants such
as Bank of America, Chase Manhattan, and First National City, which have
used their medium-term expertise to establish themselves as leaders in
multinational banking. Each of the parent banks of the consortium banks
would have had to invest resources and efforts way out of all proportion
to the results it could possibly hope to achieve had it decided to
compete directly. Yet each could also not have withdrawn from the
medium-term market without losing important customers alto- gether.</p>
<p>Very similar are the joint ventures in raw material supply. The
Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco) is a joint venture of three U.S.
oil giants—Jersey Standard, California Standard, and Mobil—to explore,
produce, and refine petroleum in Saudi Arabia. When Aramco was set up in
the forties, the oil field in Saudi Arabia was already known to be so
large as to produce far more than even a very big worldwide petroleum
company could hope to market by itself. Bringing together the marketing
systems of three major compa- nies, the Saudi Arabian oil fields were
converted from a threat to oil marketing into a ma- jor opportunity.
Finally, there is the joint venture that is created to provide what
might be called “dual nationality.” This is a joint venture created
primarily to harmonize political or cultural obstacles.</p>
<p>The best-known examples, the many joint ventures between Japanese
companies and Western partners set up since World War II, are usually
explained, especially by the Japanese, as harmonizing the Westerner’s
technical and product knowledge with a Japa- nese company’s knowledge of
its market, language, and culture. By themselves, the Japa- nese argue,
the Westerners could not manage in so alien a culture. But there are
enough Western companies successfully operating wholly-owned Japanese
subsidiaries—for in- stance, Singer, IBM, Coca-Cola, and some Swiss
pharmaceutical firms—to disprove this argument. There is little doubt
that most Western companies would have greatly preferred building or
buying their own wholly-owned Japanese subsidiaries. The reasons why
they went into joint ventures are political rather than economic.</p>
<p>The joint venture in Japan is something more important than an
economic marriage of convenience. It is a way to reconcile the
conflicting realities of an economy that is world-</p>
<p>wide and of a political system based on the nation-state. It is a way
to make productive the tension between two different kinds of power:
economic power and political power. It is therefore crucial to the
relationship between the multinational corporation and the small, but
especially the developing, nation. (On this, more in Chapter 59, “The
Multina- tional Corporation.”)</p>
<p>Ground Rules for Joint Ventures</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for a joint venture, the rules which all of them
need to observe are pretty much the same. They have to be known before a
company engages in a joint ven- ture. Otherwise, no matter how
successful the joint venture, there will be grief. Indeed the more
successful a joint venture, the more trouble there will be unless all
the partners— and their child, the joint venture company—fully
understand the ground rules.</p>
<p>Joint ventures can, of course, get into trouble because they fail.
But then it is reasona- bly clear what to do. And then the interests of
both parents are identical. Both want to straighten out the problem. And
if the joint venture cannot be saved, they want to get out with minimum
loss. But when a joint venture succeeds, it becomes problematical. For
then it always becomes clear that the interests of the parents are not
identical and are, usually, barely compatible.</p>
<p>The first rule, therefore, is to spell out in complete detail and
candor three sets of ob- jectives: the two sets of objectives of the
respective parents, and the objectives of the joint venture. It is
crucial to bring out, in advance, the basic differences in objectives
which the two parents can be assumed, with very high probability, to
hold. To say “We want our joint venture child to grow, to prosper, and
to be profitable,” and leave it at that, is simply asking for trouble a
few years hence.</p>
<p>Several joint ventures which large German chemical companies, e.g.,
Hoechst, set up with large American chemical companies in Brazil in the
middle and late fifties failed because they were successful. Then the
two partners began to disagree as to the direction and the policies the
joint venture should follow. Neither understood that the objectives of
the other had been different from the start. Indeed both assumed that
the objectives had to be the same for both. The Germans, for good and
valid reasons of their own, looked upon the Brazilian company primarily
as a user of German-developed technology against li- cense fees, and as
a buyer of German-produced raw materials and intermediates. They did not
even want the Brazilian joint venture to grow very fast, since the
parent company in the early fifties was under severe cash pressure to
finance its own growth in Europe and did not want to have to divert
scarce cash into financing the expansion of a Brazilian sub- sidiary.
The Americans, on the other hand, looked upon the Brazilian joint
venture as a “growth company,” which, in the shortest possible time,
should develop the largest possi- ble business and become both a
producer of its own technology and a producer of its own raw materials
and intermediates. And cash in those years was no problem at all for the
large American chemical companies. In fact, they suffered from excess
liquidity. When, therefore, the Brazilian companies began to grow fast,
the two partners found themselves in such irreconcilable conflict that
these joint ventures had to be liquidated with one or the other of the
two partners taking over.</p>
<p>Even when the objectives have been spelled out in advance, there is
danger of dis- agreement among the partners—and again, especially in
case of success. And both being equal—and usually equally stubborn as
well—there is no one to resolve it. A way to make a decision in case of
disagreement or deadlock should be built into the joint venture from the
start.</p>
<p>I consider it necessary to provide in advance, for instance, for an
arbitrator, an out- sider, who is respected by both parties and to whom
conflicts and disagreements will be brought. His verdict is to be
considered as final and binding. One disease to which a joint venture is
particularly prone is politicking in which the people within the joint
venture try to play off the parent companies against each other. This
can poison the atmosphere to the</p>
<p>point where the joint venture ceases to be viable. To provide in
advance for settlement of disputes is therefore elementary hygiene.</p>
<p>The joint venture has to have autonomy. The reason for forming a
joint venture is that a business, a product line, a market, an activity,
does not fit into the structure of either parent company. Then the joint
venture must be set up so that it can develop its own busi- ness, its
own mission, its own objectives, its own strategy, its own policies, in
true auton- omy.</p>
<p>This, of course, leads to the question “Who manages a joint
venture?”</p>
<p>In all but the “dual-nationality” joint ventures the answer is clear.
The joint venture needs its own management. It is not part of the
business of any of its parents, but a sepa- rate business. But the
dual-nationality joint venture is part of the business of both parents.
It is still preferable for it to have its own management. Otherwise it
should be managed in its entirely by one of the parents. Joint
management will not work and will only lead to frustration.</p>
<p>In the successful ventures between Japanese and Western companies in
Japan, man- agement is usually in the hands of the Japanese. The
Japanese in the management of the joint venture are de facto executives
of the Japanese parent company, on loan to the joint venture, who retain
their position in the seniority and promotion structure of the Japanese
parent company. In these companies there are also Americans—or other
Westerners— who are supposedly part of the joint venture’s management.
But in effect they are techni- cal advisors and usually badly frustrated
ones. Conversely, there are a few Japanese- Western joint ventures in
Japan where the Western partner has management responsibil- ity. And
then the representatives of the Japanese parent in the joint venture’s
management feel frustrated and are “outsiders.”</p>
<p>Finally, if the joint venture succeeds, and especially when it gets
to be a big business, it should be spun off. It should cease to be a
joint venture. Maybe the parents still retain an investment. But the
business then becomes independent for all intents and purposes. It
should acquire at least a minority of outside shareholders where capital
markets permit. It should finance itself, or at least be capable of
self-financing. Otherwise it will be stunted. General Motors and Jersey
Standard sold Ethyl in the fifties precisely because it had be- come too
big and too successful to be a joint venture any longer.</p>
<p>Sometimes a joint venture, especially if it is of the aggregation
type, may be split up and divided between its parents. This is bloody
and painful. But it might be the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Standard Vacuum was set up around the time of World War I as a joint
venture by Standard Oil of New Jersey and Mobil Oil to produce, refine,
and market petroleum products in the Far East. When it started, the
market in Southeast Asia was both already too large to be left
unattended, and yet still too small to give much scope. By the 1950s,
this was clearly no longer true. And the two partners also were in
fundamental disagree- ment on objectives and strategies. They therefore
decided to split Standard Vacuum, with each parent taking half of what
had been a unified company. Despite the severe trauma inflicted on a
very proud management team by such major surgery, both Jersey Standard-
Southeast Asia and Mobil Oil-Southeast Asia were within ten years larger
than Standard Vacuum at a joint venture had been projected to
become.</p>
<p>To keep Standard Vacuum as a joint venture after it had become a big
and successful company retarded its growth. Even if objectives are clear
and management autonomous, a joint venture will still, in the last
analysis, be looked upon by its parents as a tool for their objectives
rather than as a business on its own. And once a business has become
estab- lished and successful, this is wrong policy and wrong
posture.</p>
<p>Diversification will, it is fair to predict, be of even greater
importance in the years and decades to come. The pressure of “the new
markets”—the mass market for investment and capital, and the mass market
for jobs and success; the emerging world economy; the dynamics of
technology, will all push companies toward diversifying. It will,
therefore, be of utmost importance for a top management to understand
what pressures to accede to and what pressures to resist; to distinguish
between sound diversification that strengthens</p>
<p>unity and manageability, and diffusion that splinters; and to be able
to manage diversifica- tion and diversity.</p>
<p>A Note on the Family Business</p>
<p>The complexities and diversities discussed so far are complexities of
business, its prod- ucts, markets, technologies. But there is also an
important case where the complexity is not a function of business
structure but of management structure: the family business.</p>
<p>The family business used to be the norm. And there are still many
around—even big ones. But in developed countries, at least, where there
is a supply of professional manag- ers and where availability of capital
is not limited to inherited wealth and family fortunes, the large family
business is clearly on the wane. What are its needs? What does it have
to do to survive? What are its limits of size and time span?</p>
<p>There is little doubt that beyond a certain size a business can no
longer reserve man- agement to family members and remain viable. Beyond
a certain size—and that usually means beyond being fair-sized—the
management burden increasingly has to be borne by professional managers
with little or no ties to the family that founded the business. Own-
ership may still be in the hands of these families. In Japan, for
instance, ownership of the Zaibatsu groups remained in the hands of the
founding families till the end of World War II, despite the giant size
and complexity of each group. But even though Japanese families can—and
do—adopt freely, Zaibatsu management had long before 1900 become profes-
sional non-family management in all of the groups.</p>
<p>In the major European and American family companies, family also
often remained important beyond the fair-sized stage. At Siemens in
Germany, for instance, the family was powerfully represented in
management until after World War II, that is, for a hundred years. At
the Du Pont Company in the United States, the family is still powerful
in man- agement, seventy years after two Du Pont brothers and a cousin
took over, in 1902, some floundering old black-powder mills and started
building today’s Du Pont Company. But both at Siemens and at Du Pont,
professional managers long ago became equal members of the
top-management group, in authority, influence, and decision-making
powers (though not necessarily in official myth and in the proprieties
of protocol).</p>
<p>Beyond a certain size, the family can perpetuate itself only if it
succeeds in attracting and holding first-rate men who are not members of
the family—not even by adoption (which the American Du Ponts have
practiced, perhaps even more successfully than the Japanese even though,
unlike the Japanese, the “adopted” Du Ponts, who have married Du Pont
daughters, do not change their names). The family business, if it wants
to per- petuate itself, better think through, and fairly early, what
needs to be done to make living and working with a “ruling family”
acceptable to the outsider.</p>
<p>The rules are fairly simple—both Du Pont and Siemens worked them out
many years ago. Only those members of the family who, on their own
merit, qualify for a top- management position are allowed to stay in the
business. A family member in a family business has a position of
authority and power, regardless of his title and rank, even re- gardless
of his job. He has the inside track to the top—as a son, a brother, a
brother-in- law. No matter what his rank, he is top management. If he
cannot command the respect due a member of top management on his own
merit and on the basis of his performance he should not be allowed to
stay on the payroll.</p>
<p>Cousin Paul may indeed have to be supported by the family. But if he
is not of top- management caliber, he better be paid a stipend to stay
away from the office. Outside of the company he costs only his stipend.
If he is allowed to work in the company, he costs a great deal more:
respect for the family, ability to attract and hold good people, and
career opportunities for those who truly deserve them.</p>
<p>A family member who lacks ability but is willing to work hard may
still be tenable.</p>
<p>People will accept, though not very willingly, his right to a job.
The family member who is not willing to work, no matter how able, must
not be allowed in a family company. He destroys morale and breeds both
resentment and cynicism.</p>
<p>And, as Pierre du Pont realized when he restructured the Du Pont
Company in 1920 and made it capable of becoming a truly big and
successful business, the professional non-family members in the
top-management group must be given rewards and incentives that make them
feel like “owners.” Pierre du Pont invented the first stock-option plan
in American business, over the strenuous opposition of the other members
of his family. But he felt strongly and, as events proved rightly, that
without such a plan first-rate non-family members would feel
discriminated against. It is not the money that matters; it is the
status.</p>
<p>Even if the family company succeeds in attracting the professional
management it needs once it has grown beyond a certain size, it is
unlikely to perpetuate itself forever. The family’s entrepreneurial
qualities may not weaken. The Rothschilds have maintained theirs for
close to two hundred years, which is quite a bit longer than any other
dynasty on record—business or non-business—has kept its genetic vigor.
But family members be- come increasingly independent as the family
company grows and prospers. They can af- ford other pursuits and will be
attracted to them. Fewer and fewer of the members of the family, and
especially fewer and fewer of the truly able ones, will be willing to
devote themselves to the business and to give it hard work and
dedication. Eventually, the family company becomes a professionally
managed business in its entirety. Such members of the family as may
still remain in the business then become the exception rather than the
rule. The Rothschilds, it is well known, vie in pride of family with any
royal family anywhere. But even the Rothschild banks now have
non-Rothschild partners. Once this happens, the family business has
ceased to be a “family business.”</p>
<p>To run a successful family business therefore demands planning for
the day when the very success of the business makes necessary changing
its character. Within two genera- tions—and with growth to fair size—the
family becomes the beneficiary rather than the boss of such a business.
If the planning is well done—as, for instance, by Pierre du Pont in the
early twenties—careers in the business still remain a challenge for the
ablest and hardest-working members of the family. The others should much
earlier have become outside investors.</p>
