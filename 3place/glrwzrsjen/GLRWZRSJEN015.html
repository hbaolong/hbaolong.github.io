<h4 id="the-exceptions-and-their-lessons">13 The Exceptions and Their
Lessons</h4>
<p>The Exceptions: Bell Telephone; the Nineteenth-Century American
University; TVA; Meiji Japan—The Market Approach and “Socialist
Competition” —The Limits of the Market— “Public Policy” Is Not
Enough—The Special Problem of the Old, Obsolete, and Unproductive—The
Danger of Yesterday’s Success</p>
<p>The exception, the comparatively rare matters as much as the great
majority</p>
<p>service institution that achieves effectiveness, which achieve only
procedures. For the excep-</p>
<p>tion provides the lessons. It shows that effectiveness in the service
institution is achievable—though by no means easy. It shows what
different kinds of service institutions can do and need to do. It shows
limitations and pitfalls. But it also shows that the service-institution
manager can do unpopular and highly controversial things only if he
himself faces up to the risk-taking decision as to what the business of
his institution is, will be, and should be.</p>
<p>Bell Telephone</p>
<p>The first and perhaps simplest example is that of the Bell Telephone
System. A telephone system is a natural monopoly. Within a given area,
one supplier of telephone service must have exclusive rights. The one
thing any subscriber to a public telephone service requires is access to
all other subscribers, which means territorial exclusivity for one
monopolistic service. As a whole country or continent becomes in effect
one telephone system, this monopoly has to be extended over larger and
larger areas.</p>
<p>An individual may be able to do without a telephone—though in today’s
society only at prohibitive inconvenience. But a professional man, a
tradesman, an office, or a business must have a telephone. Residential
phone service may still be an option. Business phone service is
compulsory.</p>
<p>Theodore Vail, as has been said earlier, saw this in the early years
of this century. He also saw that the American Telephone Company, like
the telephone systems in all other industrially developed nations, could
easily be taken over by government. To prevent this, Vail thought
through what the telephone company’s business was and should be, and
came up with his famous definition: “Our business is service.”</p>
<p>This statement of the Telephone Company’s business then enabled Vail
to set specific goals and objectives and to develop measurements of
performance and results in terms of his definition of what the business
was and should be. His customer-satisfaction standards and
service-satisfaction standards created, in effect, nationwide
competition between telephone managers in various areas. The standards
became the measurements by which the managers were judged and rewarded.
As a result, the Telephone Company’s managers were directed, despite the
monopolistic nature of their company, toward performance and
results.</p>
<p>Vail’s solution worked for more than half a century. Until the
inflationary squeeze of the sixties, the Bell System steadily improved
service while lowering rates.</p>
<p>Vail did something even more heretical for his day (and, by and
large, even for this day). He identified Bell’s constituencies. The
regulatory agencies, i.e., the public utility commissions of the various
states, had been considered “pernicious socialism” and the “enemy” by
any right-thinking businessman of his day. Vail, however, decided that
the public was, indeed, a legitimate constituency, so that it was the
job of the telephone company to make the regulatory agencies function.
He tried to think through what their objectives were and should be.
There is little doubt that the Bell System would have been nationalized
long ago if the American public did not feel that the regulatory
agencies had been doing their job, albeit fitfully. There is also little
doubt that but for Vail and his recognition of the regulatory agencies
as a distinct constituency, the American public utility commissions
would never have acquired the capacity to function and the ability to
understand their own work.*</p>
<p>The American University</p>
<p>The building of the modern American university from 1860 to World War
I also illustrates how service institutions are made to perform. The
American university as it emerged during that period is primarily the
work of a small number of men: Andrew W. White (president of Cornell,
1868-1885); Charles W. Eliot (president of Harvard, 18691909); Daniel
Coit Gilman (president of Johns Hopkins, 1876-1901); David Starr Jordan
(president of Stanford, 1891-1913); William Rainey Harper (president of
Chicago, 18921904); and Nicholas Murray Butler (president of Columbia,
1902-1945).</p>
<p>These men all had in common one basic insight: the traditional
college—essentially an eighteenth-century seminary to train
preachers—had become totally obsolete, sterile, and unproductive. It was
dying fast; America in 1860 had far fewer college students than it had
had forty years earlier for a much smaller population. The men who built
the new universities shared a common objective: to create a new
institution, a true university. They all realized that while European
examples, especially Oxford and Cambridge and the German universities,
had much to offer, these new universities had to be American
institutions.</p>
<p>Beyond these shared beliefs, however, they differed sharply on what a
university should be and what its purpose and mission were.</p>
<p>Eliot, at Harvard, saw the purpose of the university in educating a
leadership group with a distinct style. His Harvard was to be a national
institution rather than the parochial preserve of the “proper
Bostonian,” for whom Harvard College had been founded. But it also was
to restore Boston—and to New England—the dominance of a moral elite,
such as had been held by the “Elect,” the Puritan divines, and their
successors, the Federalist leaders in the early days of the Republic.
Butler at Columbia—and to a lesser degree Harper at Chicago—saw the
function of the university as the systematic application of rational
thought and analysis to the basic problems of a modern
society—education, economics, government, foreign affairs. Gilman at
Johns Hopkins saw the university as the producer of advanced knowledge;
originally Johns Hopkins was to confine itself to ad-</p>
<p>*What the “Regulatory Commission” is may need a word of explanation
even for American readers: outside the U.S. the institution is largely
unknown. First devised in the 1880s to regulate railroads and grain
terminals, the function of the regutatory agency is to make private
enterprise function in the public interest under conditions of “natural”
monopoly where competition cannot efiectively do the job. These
agencies, by and large, have three functions: to maintain as far as
feasible competition in a service area; to protect the public against
exploitation by “natural” monopolies through control of prices and
service standards; and to limit the earnings of “natural” monopolies,
whether railroads, airlines, power companies, or broadcasters, to a
“fair return” geared to the cost of capital. The “regulatory agency”
thus presents an attempt to find a “third way” between the uncontrolled
private monopoly and—equally uncontrolled—government monopoly.
Regulatory commissions exist both at the federal level and in the
various states; the commissioners are either government-appointed (as on
all federal commissions) or elected, as in many states.</p>
<p>vanced research and was to give no undergraduate instruction. White
at Cornell aimed at producing an educated public, and so on.</p>
<p>Each of these men knew that he had to make compromises. Each knew
that he had to satisfy a number of constituencies and publics, each of
whom looked at the university quite differently. Both Eliot and Butler,
for instance, had to build their new universities on existing, old
foundations (the others could build from the ground up) and had to
satisfy— or at least to placate—existing alumni and existing faculty.
They all had to be exceedingly conscious of the need to attract and hold
financial support.</p>
<p>It was Eliot with all his insistence on “moral leadership” who
invented the first placement office and set out to find for the Harvard
graduates well-paid jobs, especially in business. It was Butler,
conscious that Columbia was a latecomer and that the millionaire
philanthropists of his day had already been snared by his competitors
(e.g., Rockefeller by Chicago), who invented the first public relations
office in a university, designed—and most, successfully—to reach the
merely well-to-do and get their money.</p>
<p>Each of these men gave priority to his definition of the university’s
purpose and mission. These definitions did not outlive the founders.
Even during the lifetime of Eliot and Butler, for instance, their
institutions escaped their control, began to diffuse objectives and to
confuse priorities. In this century all these universities—and many
others, e.g., California and other major state universities—have
converged toward a common type.</p>
<p>Today it is hard to tell one “multiversity” from another. Yet the
imprint of the founders has still not been totally erased. It is hardly
an accident that the New Deal picked primarily faculty members from
Columbia and Chicago to be high-level advisers and policy-makers; for
the New Deal was, of course, committed to the application of rational
thought and analysis to public policies and problems. Thirty years later
when the Kennedy Administration came in with an underlying belief in the
“style” of an elite, it naturally turned to Harvard.</p>
<p>In 1860 higher education in America hardly existed; and what existed
was discredited and unsupported by the public. By 1900 the American
university had become established as a leader, a major power center, and
as an intellectual, social, and political authority. In 1860 America had
a smaller proportion of its young people in college than any other
leading country; by 1900 it already had a larger proportion in its
colleges and the foundations for mass higher education were being laid.
In 1860 America depended for scholarship, research, and science on
Europe; Americans who distinguished themselves in such pursuits (e.g.,
Francis Parkman as a historian, Emerson as a philosopher, or Joseph
Henry as a physicist) had no university connection. And America’s pride
was the self-taught inventors. By 1900 America had attained both
achievement and self-confidence in scholarship, research, and science.
Men of intellectual or scientific distinction (e.g., William James in
philosophy, John Dewey in education, Charles Heard and Frederick J.
Turner in history, Albert Michelson in physics) were all members of a
university. At the same time the American university of 1900 was a
distinctly American institution, no matter how many of its professors
had done their graduate work in Germany, or how many could be heard to
sigh for the Oxford amenities of high table and port.</p>
<p>What underlay this example of high effectiveness and high achievement
was, above all, a clear commitment to one specific definition of purpose
and mission.</p>
<p>Lilienthal and the TVA</p>
<p>A different but equally instructive example is that of the Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA, the public utility and public works complex in
the south-central United States). Built mainly in New Deal days, the TVA
today is no longer controversial. It is just another large power company
except for being owned by the government rather than by private
investors. This was not the case in its early days, forty years ago.
Then the TVA was a slogan, a battle cry, a symbol. Some, friends and
enemies alike, saw in it the opening wedge of the nationalization of
electric energy in the United States. Others saw in it the vehicle for a
return to Jeffersonian agrarianism based on cheap power, government</p>
<p>paternalism, and free fertilizer. Others still were primarily
interested in flood control and navigation. There was such a wealth of
conflicting expectations that TVA’s first head, Arthur Morgan, a
distinguished engineer and economist, floundered completely. Unable to
think through what the business of the TVA should be and how varying
objectives might be balanced, Morgan accomplished nothing. Finally,
President Roosevelt replaced him with an almost totally unknown young
lawyer with little previous experience as an administrator, David
Lilienthal.</p>
<p>Lilienthal faced up to the need to define TVA’s business. He
concluded that the first objective was to build truly efficient electric
plants and to supply an energy-starved region with plentiful and cheap
power. All the rest, he decided, hinged on the attainment of this first
need, which then became his operational priority. Today TVA has
accomplished many other objectives as well, flood control, navigable
waterways, fertilizer production, and even balanced community
development. But it was Lilienthal’s insistence on a clear definition of
TVA’s business and on setting priorities that explains why TVA is now
taken for granted, even by those who, forty years ago, were its
implacable enemies.</p>
<p>The Lesson of Meiji</p>
<p>The most important example of service-institution performance may be
the development of Japan in the second half of the nineteenth century,
after the so-called Meiji Restoration of 1868. Thirty years later Japan,
previously an exceedingly poor and largely rural country, encased in a
rigid straitjacket of class and caste, had become a modern nation, a
major military power capable of defeating Imperial Russia, and a major
factor in world trade. At the same time it had become the first country
in which illiteracy was virtually unknown.</p>
<p>The Meiji statesmen, patriots, and business leaders who brought about
this transformation included no more than a handful of truly remarkable
men. But, of course, these were still a tiny minority even within the
leadership group. The job was done by ordinary, competent, hard-working
men. What explains their success was the willingness of the Meiji
generation to think through objectives, to set a few priorities, and to
concentrate on them.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Meiji Restoration was defined as the preservation
of Japanese independence and of Japanese culture and tradition in a
world dominated by Western imperialism. These objectives were summarized
in the slogan “a wealthy country, a strong army,” which required general
literacy and uniform local administration and justice throughout the
country. The five goals of economic growth, modern army and navy,
literacy, uniform local government, and a strong professional judiciary
became the priorities on which the men of Meiji concentrated.</p>
<p>One can quarrel with these priorities—a great many Japanese and
foreign critics have done so. Little was done, for instance, to improve
the peasant’s lot or to cushion the poor against the upheavals of
forced-draft industrialization. Little was done to make the highly
literate new Japanese middle class capable of self-government. The men
of Meiji were conscious of these omissions but they decided deliberately
that there had to be priorities, thought through what they should be,
and then concentrated on them the energies of a gifted, hard-working,
and patriotic people.</p>
<p>There are other examples. To illustrate effectiveness in a
university, for instance, Wilhelm von Humboldt’s founding of the
University of Berlin in the darkest days of German defeat by Napoleon
might be mentioned. Another example, as said before, is some of the new
English “red brick” universities, founded since World War II as a
result, largely, of the thinking on objectives and priorities done by a
distinguished economist, Lionel Robbins. The few New York ghetto schools
in which the kids learn have also been mentioned earlier. Another
example from education would be the Folk High School, which the Danish
Bishop Nikolaj Grundtvig conceived almost 150 years ago, and which
became the foundation both for the evolution of the Scandinavian
countries into model democracies and for all continuing education today.
I might have taken a few examples of service effectiveness from other
areas, e.g., health care or research labs.</p>
<p>Each of these effective public-service institutions can be said to be
sui generis. Each is certainly completely different. But these examples
demonstrate that service institutions can be managed for
performance.</p>
<p>Market Approach and “Socialist Competition”</p>
<p>Our examples illustrate, first, that the task cannot be accomplished
on the basis of either one of the traditional and prevailing approaches.
Neither the approach that says “Let the market do the job” nor the one
that says “Let public interest prevail and drive the moneychangers out”
can work for the budget-based service institution.</p>
<p>The market approach is commonly considered “capitalist.” But it is a
misunderstanding. The market approach can equally be “socialist.”
Whether ownership is in capitalist hands or not is no longer primary.
What matters is managerial autonomy and accountability. What matters is
whether resources are being allocated to produce results and on the
basis of results.</p>
<p>The prevailing idea that the U.S. economy is capitalistic because
ownership is private is a misunderstanding. Decisive ownership of
American big business is in the hands of the people—that is, in the
hands of the mutual funds and pension funds who are the fiduciaries for
the middle class and workers. Big business in the U.S. has not been
nationalized, but it has largely, been socialized. In terms of the
classical definition, the U.S. is, at best, a mixed and may steadily be
approaching a socialist economy in which the public owns the means of
production. But the U.S. manages largely on the basis of local autonomy
of the enterprise and allocates resources on the basis of results. It is
still a market economy.</p>
<p>Japan conforms even less to the traditional identification of
ownership as the determinant. If anyone in Japan can be said to own the
big companies, it would be their employees and especially their
managers. Since they cannot be dismissed but have lifetime employment,
they are what the law calls the beneficial owners even though they have
no legal title. Yet, Japan is clearly not a socialist economy.</p>
<p>The most searching discussion of market economics in the last fifty
years has not been conducted in the free-enterprise countries or in the
free-enterprise camp. It has been the discussion of what is known as
socialist competition, that is, competition in an economy in which the
means of production are not owned by private capitalists.</p>
<p>This discussion goes back to the years immediately following World
War I when the Social Democrats, newly in power, expected to nationalize
German business. They set up a powerful Socialization Commission to work
out the transition from a capitalist to a socialist economy. The
economists on the Socialization Commission were themselves mostly
committed socialists. But they had also experienced first-hand the
inefficiency, ineffectiveness, and wastefulness of Germany’s planned
economy during World War I. Instead of a blueprint of a socialist
economy, they produced what can only be called a “capitalist
manifesto.”*</p>
<p>The German Socialization Commission did advocate strong direction by
government, but for the economy itself it recommended a basically
oligopolistic market economy, in which large privately owned and
privately managed companies would compete with each other in each major
market.†</p>
<p>This, of course, was totally unacceptable to orthodox Marxists, but
the logic was unassailable. Government monopolies, the Germans had shown
conclusively, would not produce and would not build a strong
economy.</p>
<p>The Russian planning approach, developed a few years later, was
designed to answer and to confute this heresy. Another answer,
however—and one of greater subtlety and</p>
<p>*A striking parallel is the impact of World War II on American
economists. Most of the economists who joined the World War II
economic-control agencies were inclined toward planning and controls
when they went in. Their formative experiences and background were,
after all, the Depression years. But most came out of the World War II
agencies as confirmed enemies of controls and believers in the market,
at least as the lesser evil. †This blueprint, by the way, bears a
striking resemblance both to what Adenauer’s Germany after World War II
adopted as “social market economy” and to the way today’s Japan actually
runs its “free economy.”</p>
<p>importance—was given by a Polish Marxist, Oscar Lange (who for many
years taught at the University of Chicago, before returning after World
War II to die in his native country), who called his alternative
“socialist competition.” Lange’s model provides for public ownership’ of
the means of production, thus eliminating the capitalist. But it also
provides for autonomous businesses, under their own managements,
competing in a market economy and getting paid for results. What Lange
said, in other words, is that socialist doctrine demands that ownership
be socialized. But the allocation of resources has to be done by
performance and results, that is, on the basis of the market test, if an
economy is to allocate its resources rationally and be capable of
performance.</p>
<p>The one basic weakness of Lange’s approach is that it completely
omits the market for capital, that is, the allocation of resources to
the future. Yet it does introduce accountability and a focus on results.
Lange’s socialist competition underlies all proposals for liberalization
in the Soviet bloc, such as the abortive economic reforms of the Czechs
in 1967 and 1968 which provoked Russian military invasion.*</p>
<p>The Russian opposition to the attempts at socialist competition was,
of course, not based on arguments of economic rationality and economic
performance. It was based on the perfectly valid argument that making
business management autonomous will weaken, perhaps fatally, the total
political control of the Communist party. Lange, as all economists
should do, put performance before power. The rulers of a police state
always put power before performance.</p>
<p>Lange’s ideas were being converted into reality in Yugoslavia in the
late sixties. There major businesses, while nominally owned by the
government, are managed autonomously and have to prove themselves in a
market in which there is a good deal of competition. Yugoslav businesses
are no longer financed directly by allocation on the basis of a national
plan. Instead they have to compete for capital on the basis of the
expected return on the investment, that is, on a “capitalist” and
profit-making basis.</p>
<p>All attempts in the Soviet Union to inject performance into the
economy are essentially attempts to introduce Lange’s socialist
competition, that is, managerial autonomy and accountability based on
market performance and market result (though both Lange’s name and the
term “socialist competition” are still verboten). There is little
resistance anymore to the argument of the reformers that socialist
competition would yield vastly superior economic results; the resistance
is to the risk of losing political control.</p>
<p>In other words, the debate over the market and the morality of
private ownership for profit is largely becoming irrelevant. The debate
should be conducted over the performance capacity of a system under
which business is being paid for results and performance as against a
system in which it is being financed out of budget allocations. On that
score there is essentially no debate. Wherever a market test is truly
possible, it will result in performance and results—not because of the
greater “virtue” of free enterprise or of autonomous managers but
because being paid for performance and results directs toward
performance and results.</p>
<p>The Limits of the Market</p>
<p>But it is equally clear that the market is not capable of organizing
all institutions.</p>
<p>Service institutions are a most diverse lot. They include natural
monopolies, which are obviously economic institutions—the telephone
service, the postal service, but also the electricity supply in a given
area. Service institutions also include the administration of justice
and defense, which, equally obviously, are not and should not be
economic institutions. The one and only thing they all have in common is
that, for one reason or another, they cannot be organized under a
competitive market test.†</p>
<p>*On this see Ota Sik, Czechoslovakia: The Bureaucratic Economy
(International Arts and Sciences Press, 1972); Sik was the economic
architect of the Czech reforms until ousted by the Russians.</p>
<p>†This may no longer be necessarily true for the postal service; at
least an independent postal company in the U.S. is trying to organize a
business in competition to the government’s postal monopoly. Should this
work out,</p>
<p>The Limits of Public Policy</p>
<p>The traditional conclusion of capitalists and socialists alike has
been that where the market cannot provide a performance test, “public
policy” will provide guidance and control; but, as our discussion of the
impact of the budget basis shows, this is not an adequate answer. To be
sure, service institutions, including those within a business, must be
controlled by policy. But they need more than programs, promises, good
intentions, and hard work, the whole underwritten by a budget. They need
a system and structure that directs them toward performance—wherever
possible. As our examples show, service institutions also need the
discipline of planned obsolescence and planned abandonment of their
policies. In every one of our cases, effectiveness was obtained for a
time—but not forever.</p>
<p>Vail’s solution worked for a half century—but, as said earlier, it is
by no means sure that it works any longer. The American university has
outgrown the structure its founders built a century ago. It needs now
new thinking about its mission and function, its objective and
governance, its priorities and the criteria by which it should measure
its accomplishments and results. The TVA has performed so well as to
make itself irrelevant. What it pioneered forty years ago is now
commonplace; no one any longer expects salvation by electrification.</p>
<p>Japan ultimately became a prisoner of the success of Meiji. The men
of Meiji were very conscious that they had chosen priorities and had
postponed or subordinated important areas. Their successors refused to
consider any other priorities. As a result, military strength, which to
the men of Meiji was a means to the end of Japanese independence, became
an end in itself and ultimately brought catastrophe on Japan, almost
wrecking the great achievement of the Meiji generation.</p>
<p>it would do more to restore performance to the mails than setting up
a postal monopoly as a separate “public corporation” that is on a
“businesslike” basis.</p>
