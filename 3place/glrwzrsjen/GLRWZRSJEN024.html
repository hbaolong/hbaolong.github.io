Benefits</h4>
<p>Job Security and Income Stability—Resistance to Change and Job
Insecurity— American Job Mobility: Myths and Reality—The
Shortcomings—The Rehn Plan— Needed: Organized Placement—Profits,
Productivity, and Benefits—Making “Bene- fits” Benefit—What Benefits
Should Be—Benefits and the Work Community</p>
<p>Ljob and</p>
<p>fear of loss of job and income is incompatible with taking
responsibility for work group, for output and performance. That the fear
is becoming less per-</p>
<p>vasive—to the point where it no longer acts as a spur—makes it all
the more destruc- tive. It contrasts so sharply with the standard of
living and the standard of security to which most workers in a developed
society have become accustomed.</p>
<p>To accept the burden of responsibility, the worker—the unskilled as
well as the skilled worker, and the manual as well as the knowledge
worker—needs a fair measure of secu- rity of job and income.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the worker needs also mobility. Every
worker needs to be able to escape the wrong job. Every worker needs to
be able to move from a dying com- pany or industry into one that grows
or at least into one that has a chance for survival. And the knowledge
worker, especially the highly educated one, needs to be able to move
where his skill and knowledge can make the greatest contribution. To
leave knowledge skill underutilized is impoverishment of society and
individual alike.</p>
<p>The economy also needs a fair degree of labor-cost flexibility, and
so does every busi- ness. The widespread belief that wages take the main
brunt of economic fluctuation is, of course, nonsense. The main burden
is carried by the capital fund—as it should be. In a bad year profits go
down sharply or disappear. But the share of wage incomes in total
revenue—whether of the economy or of a business—actually goes up sharply
in recession years. Capital costs, in other words are the least fixed
costs of an economy despite the accountant’s contrary terminology. And
labor costs are the most nearly fixed costs of an economy or of a
business. But there is still need for flexibility, still need for
relating wage costs to the level of economic activity, to the other
costs of an economy, to the profit re- quirements of the capital fund,
and to productivity.</p>
<p>Finally there is need to assuage the conflict between wage fund and
capital fund. It cannot be eliminated. But there is need for some
mechanism that establishes a tie between the two, both to make visible
the worker’s long-term stake in the capital fund and to en- able him to
understand the function of profit and profitability.</p>
<p>There is nothing very new to these requirements. In different ways
different econo- mies and different businesses have been struggling with
them all along. But managements have, by and large, not managed
employment, incomes, and benefits. They have reacted and adapted. These
are, however, areas of genuine managerial responsibility. These are
management tasks.</p>
<p>Job Security and Income Stability</p>
<p>That workers resist higher productivity and innovative changes is a
very old theme. The cloth workers of Florence in the days of the
Renaissance rioted against new technology as a threat to their jobs.</p>
<p>But the resistance of workers on all levels against higher
productivity and against in- novation is not based solely on the fear of
working oneself out of one’s own job. Equally important is the fear that
the achieving worker will work other workers out of their jobs. As a
result, group pressure is brought into play against the worker who, by
wanting to achieve, becomes a threat to the security of his fellow
workers.</p>
<p>Resistance to change and resistance to innovation are not inherent in
human nature.</p>
<p>The Japanese experience proves this. And wherever a Western business
has provided comparable job and income security, resistance to change or
to innovation has disap- peared.</p>
<p>This was the experience of Zeiss in the last century, as it has been
the experience of IBM in the twenty-five years after World War II.</p>
<p>Another example is Krupp in Germany, where workers were, until
recently, assured of lifetime employment and where resistance to change
and innovation were virtually un- known. This in large measure explains
the ability of Krupp, for long periods of time, to hold a leadership
position in the steel fabricating industry on the European
continent.</p>
<p>Similarly, Marks andandandand Spencer in England, while having no
formal job guarantees, does, in effect, provide stable and practically
guaranteed employment—and again there is no resistance to change or to
innovation.</p>
<p>That resistance to change has its origin in fear of loss of job is
proved by a Japanese example. For not all Japanese industry is receptive
to change.</p>
<p>A significant exception is the Japanese National Railways. Workers on
the railways have guaranteed employment security, and yet they are
haunted by the fear of job loss. For everybody in Japan, and especially
the railway employee himself, knows that the railways are grossly
overstaffed. Any change in work rules, in procedures, in regulations,
threatens to expose the basic redundancy and excess manpower of the
system. Every such change is, therefore, bitterly resisted and, in fact,
prevented by the employees. And Japa- nese railway workers, while
probably the best-paid workers in Japan, have the worst and most bitter
industrial relations with their employer, the government.</p>
<p>It is not, in other words, just legal or contractual guarantees of
job and income that are needed. To give the worker the security he needs
to take responsibility, there must be reality to the promise. To keep
people on the payroll for whom there is no job may create insecurity as
great as actual loss of job. What is needed is not just the guarantee of
in- come, but a system which actively end systematically provides work,
that is, productive membership in society.</p>
<p>In the West a formal guarantee of jobs and incomes is the exception
rather than the rule—though I have, I believe, given enough examples to
show that the exceptions are far more numerous than most people (and
practically all union leaders) believe. But job secu- rity and income
assurance have increasingly been built into this system.</p>
<p>The first step was unemployment compensation. But on top of this
individual compa- nies and individual industries, with or without union
contracts, have developed a multi- tude of provisions: supplemental
unemployment compensation; severance pay; and sen- iority rules in
layoffs which, in effect, give older employees practical job
security.</p>
<p>As a result, labor costs in the West have, in effect, become more and
more inflexible.</p>
<p>They may today, at least in basic industries, be less flexible than
the labor costs of Japan. A U.S. employer in mass-production industry
can lay off employees fairly easily— certainly far more easily than a
Japanese, or even a European employer could. But he is then committed to
severance pay, to high supplementary unemployment compensation payments,
and to other burdens which in effect mean that he still keeps on paying
some- thing like three-quarters or more of the laid-off worker’s wages
for something like from six to nine months.</p>
<p>At the same time, Western labor forces, at least compared to the
Japanese, have fairly high mobility. Knowledge workers, in particular,
can and do move easily from one em- ployer to another.</p>
<p>There is, even in the U.S., a belief that American workers, and
especially knowledge people, change jobs all the time. But with respect
to managers and professionals this is largely myth.</p>
<p>In the large—and in most small—American companies actual turnover is
quite low among managers and professionals. There is considerable
turnover in the entrance jobs, that is, in the first three to five years
of a man’s employment. There is considerable turn- over—considerably
more than used to be common in Europe, let alone Japan—in top management
jobs. In between, though—among older workers, lower and middle man-
agement, and among professional and technical knowledge workers—job
change is the exception rather than the rule. In every large American
company the great majority of the middle ranks are filled with people
who have at most changed jobs once, and that within a few years after
their graduation from college. Their first job change, made when they
were still quite young, is usually their last one. After that they may
move geographically from one location of the company to another, but
they very rarely change employers. There is almost no difference in
length of service and in career patterns between manage- rial,
professional, and technical people in an American large company and in a
European company, say, between General Electric and Siemens. There is
not even tremendous dif- ference in the middle ranks and in the age
group between the late twenties and the late fifties, between the
typical large American company and the Japanese company.</p>
<p>Job stability is also the rule rather than the exception for
blue-collar workers in the U.S. A good measure of this is the experience
of the private pension plans in American industry which cover virtually
all large- and medium-sized enterprises (and probably a majority of
small businesses as well). These plans are under sharp attack these days
be- cause “only 70 percent of the employees actually receive a pension.”
This is indeed a se- rious shortcoming and needs to be remedied—by
earlier “vesting” of pension rights, for instance, and by making them
“portable,” that is, transferable from one employer to an- other. But
the problem arises because in most U.S. pension plans eligibility is
conditional upon working for the same employer twenty-five to thirty
years. Two-thirds of the work force, in other words, have what is in
effect lifetime employment—a far larger proportion, by the way, than in
Japan. The “average” job mobility of the U.S. worker is indeed high. But
again the great bulk of the turnover, as in the case of managers and
professionals, is in the very early years, when many young people change
jobs two or even three times a year. After they have worked for five or
six years, have married, and have begun to raise a family, they tend to
stop moving—and soon acquire enough seniority to have substantial job
security.</p>
<p>The Shortcomings</p>
<p>Economically (in terms of total labor costs and incomes) the
developed countries bave arrived at a high degree of employment security
and income stability. And yet both “mod- els,” the American-European and
the Japanese, have serious shortcomings.</p>
<p>The American-European system may actually, as said before, have less
flexibility of labor costs than the Japanese. But psychologically the
fear persists. Income stability is least assured when the worker needs
it the most, that is, when his children are small and when he may have
old parents to support. For then he has comparatively low seniority.
There is also no true “system” but rather a confused mess of ad hoc
improvisations. As a result, the individual case is almost
unpredictable. One man may actually have all but complete income
security even for prolonged periods of unemployment or sickness. An-
other man may have little or none.</p>
<p>Mobility is available in the West (though by no means
unrestricted—there are very real obstacles, especially in the form of
union restrictions and demarcations that close access to crafts and jobs
to newcomers). But information on job opportunities, except in a</p>
<p>few areas of knowledge work, is scarce. Statistically, the danger of
long-term unemploy- ment is very small (except in a genuine depression
in an economy, industry, or isolated geographic region). But the
individual sees no pattern. The fear of being out of a job therefore
remains.</p>
<p>diminished uncertainty and with it fear. But nothing comparable
exists in most countries for rank-and-file workers and clerks.</p>
<p>The Japanese system gives to employees in Japan’s “modern”
organizations a high degree of psychological security. But its lack of
mobility is a weakness, and one that will become increasingly serious.
It commits Japan to maintenance of employment in yester- day’s
industries while it starves tomorrow’s industries, especially in a
period—such as the 1970s and 1980s—when the supply of new workers will
shrink because of population changes. The restriction on mobility is
becoming increasingly irksome to young, highly qualified knowledge
people. They also increasingly become economic waste as highly qualified
people—e.g., engineers, computer experts, and accountants—cannot move
where their knowledge would make the greatest contribution but are
forced to stay put even if there is little real work for them. And with
the center of gravity of the work force shifting to knowledge workers
even faster in Japan than in the West as a result of the edu- cation
explosion, this threatens to become an increasing impairment.</p>
<p>The Rehn Plan</p>
<p>The Swedish experience shows that these shortcomings are not
preordained either by eco- nomic or by social “laws.” The Swedish system
was devised by a union leader, Goesta Rehn, in the early fifties. Rehn
realized that Sweden had to change industrial and eco- nomic structure
and had to shrink traditional low-technology and low-productivity indus-
try. At the same time, he realized that the worker had to be given
security. Under the Swedish system—in sharp contrast to that favored in
most other Western countries— industries and companies are not being
encouraged to maintain employment. On the con- trary, they are being
encouraged to anticipate any redundancy in employment that might result
from technological development or economic change. At the same time
businesses and industries are expected to anticipate future needs for
additional workers and their skills. This information is fed to the Rehn
Board, a semi-governmental, semiprivate or- ganization in which
government, employers, and labor unions work together. The Board</p>
<p>then underwrites the income of the redundant employee. It trains him.
It finds a new job for him and places him in it. If necessary it moves
him to a new location and pays for the move.</p>
<p>The Rehn Plan explains in large measure the economic transformation
of Sweden. As late as 1950 Sweden was still almost an underdeveloped
country for most of her popula- tion. The bulk of the labor force was
employed in low-productivity and low-income activ- ity. Twenty years
later Sweden had become one of the technological leaders of the world
with a living standard second only to that of the United States. A
larger proportion of the work force than in any other country, including
Japan, has moved from one kind of em- ployment to another, with a
minimum of disruption, with almost no resistance to change, and with
extraordinary willingness to acquire new skills and to learn new
things.</p>
<p>The Swedish example shows that, even in a major economic shift,
insecurity of jobs and income is not a very big problem. The fear is
real and paralyzing. But the problem itself, in statistical terms, is
marginal.</p>
<p>A Swedish trade union leader who at first opposed the Rehn Plan (as
he told me) found the perfect analogy: “Remember,” he said, “when every
mother was scared stiff of polio every summer? Yet, statistically polio
was a very minor risk, far less than that of any other illness around.
All of us were as afraid of unemployment and job loss as moth- ers used
to be of polio. The fear paralyzed us. And the reason was exactly the
same as that</p>
<p>which made mothers panic at the very thought of polio. Every case,
however rare, was unpredictable, mysterious and catastrophe.”</p>
<p>Sweden, under the Rehn Plan, took responsibility for the worker way
beyond what even the Japanese do. Yet the expense was marginal. In fact,
Sweden—despite very high unemployment compensation—pays probably less
for the maintenance of jobs and in- comes than does American industry
under its various supplementary compensation and severance plans.</p>
<p>Needed: Organized Placement</p>
<p>We need to make explicit the actuality of high job security and (in
the West) even higher income stability. In the West we need also to
build in the Japanese relationship between income assurance and the need
for income security of different groups, especially with respect lo
stages in a family’s life cycle. The Japanese, in turn, will surely have
to develop mobility, especially for the knowledge worker.</p>
<p>But in addition, job security and employment stability require
organized placement ac- tivity. The cost is almost insignificant. But
lacking systematic placement, the employer will be “frozen in.” He will
not be able to reduce employment—or at least labor costs. Yet there will
still be fear and insecurity unless the employer takes active
responsibility, one way or another, for placing employees who have to be
let go. Wherever an employer has accepted the commitment to finding a
job for redundant workers, the result has been psychological security.
Examples abound: Zeiss again led the way. While Zeiss had em- ployment
security through periods of minor economic fluctuations, it did
experience oc- casional truly poor years. And there was a fair amount of
technological redundancy de- spite continuous learning. Then Zeiss tried
to place the men whose jobs were being abol- ished—and rarely had any
difficulty finding for them at least as good a job as they had had at
Zeiss.</p>
<p>A more recent example is a major American manufacturer of glass and
plastic con- tainers which, for many years, and without any formal
announcement, has considered it the employer’s duty to find jobs for
people who because of technological or economic change become
redundant—whether they are rank-and-file manual workers, clerical
workers, professionals, or managers. The number of people who have to be
placed is rea- sonably small in any one year. In most cases the manager
of the unit, with the help of people in the personnel department, can
place the handful of “problem cases” easily and within his own locality.
Once in a while it becomes necessary to retrain a man at company
expense. And once in a while it becomes necessary to give a man early
retirement with a fairly substantial pension. Over the years the program
has cost almost nothing in that company workers are willing to take a
very high degree of responsibility for their own jobs and their own
achievement. And resistance to technological change and to higher
productivity is minimal.</p>
<p>A very different example is that of a major worldwide management
consulting firm.</p>
<p>Professional employees have no employment security the first three to
five years. They are on probation, and turnover is fairly high. Men who
last beyond this probationary pe- riod and become consultants will, it
is clearly understood, not be kept on the payroll past age thirty-eight
or forty unless they are accepted by the group as full partners. Only
one out of every six or seven therefore stays on past forty. Yet there
is no fear in the group, no demand for job or income security. For the
firm, without legal commitment, undertakes to place everyone who has
passed the probationary period but then does not qualify within the
ensuing ten years for full partnership. The senior partners themselves
do most of the placement through their personal acquaintances throughout
world business. Every junior knows that he will be asked in all
probability to leave the firm just when he needs job and income the
most, that is, at a time when his family needs are greatest. Yet he is
not very much concerned. He knows that the firm will take responsibility
for placing him and, with it, for maintaining, if not improving, his
income.</p>
<p>The Swedish system would clearly not work in a major economic
depression. Nor would any other, including the Japanese system. But a
major economic depression is a rare event, and people know then that
there is no protection and do not expect miracles.</p>
<p>The basic problem in job and income security is not general
catastrophe. It is the im- pact on the individual of minor changes,
technological advances which obsolete one com- pany, one industry, or
one craft; improvements in productivity which lead to a cutting back of
the labor force required; minor shifts in economic demands; in
transportation economics, in product line, or in process. Statistically
these are marginal events. For the individual they are “polio.”</p>
<p>This is no longer a problem of money. The money is being spent to
provide job secu- rity and income stability. The need now is, first—in
the West, in particular—to make ex- plicit, overt, and visible the
security that exists. And second, as the Swedes have shown, the mobility
which economy, enterprise, and worker require needs to be organized.
What is needed, in other words, is a little intelligence and some hard
work.</p>
<p>Profits, Productivity, and Benefits</p>
<p>The job as a living is the worker’s first concern with respect to the
economic dimension of working. But there is also the apparent conflict
between wage fund and capital fund, that is, between the worker’s
economic interest in wage and salary and the need of economy and
enterprise (and ultimately of workers) for profits and productivity.</p>
<p>In the United States, at least, this conflict should by now be moot
and a thing of the past. For increasingly in the American economy, the
worker is the beneficiary of both the wage fund and the capital
fund.</p>
<p>Increasingly American industry—at least the large and middle-sized
American busi- ness—is being “owned” for the employees’ benefit by the
trustees of the employees. By 1990—or at the latest by the year 2000—the
pension funds and the mutual funds (and most shareholders in mutual
funds are low- and middle-income employees) will own be- tween
two-thirds and three-quarters or more of the large and medium-sized
businesses of America. Already by now, that is, in the early 1970s,
these trustees of the workers have become the largest single group of
shareholders and owners in the American economy. They are the only true
“capitalists” around.</p>
<p>Yet the fact that worker and shareowner are becoming one and the same
person seems to have very little impact, if any, on the hostility to
profit. Even total worker ownership and the elimination of all outside
owners does not have much impact, it seems.</p>
<p>One large American company that is totally employee-owned is United
Parcel Service (which has, in effect, replaced the U.S. Post Office as
the main provider of parcel post services throughout the country). Yet,
United Parcel has for years plagued by labor trou- bles. The employees
clearly do not identify themselves with the “bosses” against whom they
strike.</p>
<p>On a much larger scale Yugoslavia teaches the same lesson. All larger
businesses in Yugoslavia are owned by their workers, with an elected
workers’ council the enterprise’s governing organ. Yet, no Yugoslav
management has reported any pressure from the own- ers for higher
profits. On the contrary, managements have to fight for adequate profits
against worker resistance. The constant demand is for lower profits and
higher wages, to the point where the Yugoslav experiment of
worker-ownership of industry is seriously being endangered by wage
inflation.</p>
<p>The most curious case is probably Japan. The employees of the
company, especially of the large, modern one, are the only true owners.
Since an employee, whether rank-and- file worker or executive
vice-president, cannot be fired, as a rule, the enterprise is actually
run for the employees. They are the “beneficial owners,” in legal (or
economic) terms. And since they cannot find a job elsewhere as a rule,
the employees have an overriding self-interest in the survival and
prosperity of the company that employs them. In the West, it used to be
said that “all the worker owns is his capacity to work.” In Japan he
does not even own that; his only real property is the welfare of his
company. Yet in no other coun-</p>
<p>try is resistance to profits so great. Indeed one is told again and
again that for “us Japa- nese” profit is a dirty word and synonymous
with exploitation.</p>
<p>The worker-owner who resists profits and rejects the needs of the
capital fund is, however, not altogether irrational. And to explain his
resistance as the result of “socialist agitation,” as conservatives have
done for a hundred years, is fatuous.</p>
<p>The main reason is simply that profit is too small in relation to
wage and salary to tilt the balance for the worker-owner. This is
particularly true in the society of organizations where most working
people are employees on a wage or a salary. Wage and salary income of
employees in such a society is about two-thirds of a country’s total
personal income, after-tax profits a scant 5 or 6 percent. The real
property of the employee, in other words, and the income on which he
depends, is his job. Profit—even if he gets all of it—is a fringe
benefit, and not a very big one. Rational behavior for the employee is
clearly to maximize wage and salary income, even at the expense of his
own share in profits.</p>
<p>A second—but not secondary—explanation is that plans which pay out
profit shares or productivity shares as income, are, of necessity,
fair-weather plans. They work well as long as profits and productivity
go up. They create resentment and frustration the moment profit shares
and productivity bonuses no longer go up but go down. And, in any given
year, two-fifths of the businesses in any economy do not have a profit
but operate at a loss.</p>
<p>It is basic fallacy to treat profit as income. Profit is capital
fund, that is, savings. Only if used to build a capital fund for the
worker can it have meaning. Only then can the func- tion of profit even
be understood.</p>
<p>Wherever profit as, capital fund has been structured as an employee
benefit, the im- pact has been great. In some cases the resistance to
profit almost completely disappeared.</p>
<p>One example—admittedly an atypical one—is the Sears, Roebuck
profit-sharing pen- sion fund. There is a clear relationship between
company profits and a major need of the employee namely, retirement
pensions. There is a clear link between the profitability of the company
and the size of the pension which a retiring employee will receive. To
be sure, Sears has been a singularly profitable company so that its plan
has been a bonanza for long-serving employees. But it is also reasonable
to assume that the employee’s knowledge that the company’s profitability
meant a larger retirement pension for him may have had something to do
with the company’s profitability. Employees on all levels, from the very
lowest on up, and including members of militant unions, have been
willing to contribute to profits and willing to accept increased company
profitability as objective for themselves.</p>
<p>The Sears example, as also the Zeiss example, would indicate that
benefits are the area in which a meaningful link between company
profitability and worker needs can be at- tempted. In the benefit areas
the individual employee builds up his capital fund. He needs certainty
with respect to his expectations and provision against risk. At the same
time, individual certainty can be provided in many benefit areas on the
basis of a probability distribution, that is, at a fairly low cost per
individual.</p>
<p>One of these areas is the risk of survival, that is, the need for
some retirement provi- sion. With present life expectancy, survival to
retirement has become the great probabil- ity. If spread over enough
years and over a large enough group, the certainty of adequate
retirement income can be financed by a fairly low annual payment per
individual covered. Another such area where there is need for certainty
of benefits is health care. The individ- ual economic risk goes beyond
anything even the rich can carry. But there is a probability
distribution which makes collective coverage reasonably cheap. Finally,
there is job and income security, again a risk of catastrophe for the
individual, but, on a probability basis, a fairly low group risk.</p>
<p>These are benefits which can be provided for out of fluctuating
profits. In any one year the contribution to a retirement fund, a health
plan, or a job and income maintenance fund can fluctuate. What matters
is that the provision be adequate over a three- to ten-year period, that
is, that low contributions in one year be compensated for by higher
contribu- tions in another more profitable year.</p>
<p>Making “Benefits” Benefit</p>
<p>But to be effective, benefit plans, however generous, will have to be
restructured.</p>
<p>There is no lack of fringe benefits in developed countries. They have
grown like weeds. They began to develop around 1920. Since then two
systems have come into be- ing.</p>
<p>One is the Japanese system where benefits are highly selective. They
are focused on the needs of individual groups and individuals. There is
no systematic plan, as a rule. The individual has no rights. Employer
contributions to benefits are not made according to actuarial
projections, generally, but according to the needs of the moment.</p>
<p>In the West, benefits have developed into highly structured rights
with rigid plans. By and large, there is flexibility neither in
contribution nor in beneficiary. The employer pays a certain fixed
amount per employee. And all employees regardless of age, sex, skill,
and so on, receive exactly the same benefits, absolutely or in
proportion to salary, whether they fit their major needs or not.</p>
<p>Both systems have made the worker, in effect, the major recipient of
profits, that is, the major recipient of, and conduit for, the capital
fund. For provisions for workers’ re- tirement or for workers’ education
are capital investments rather than wages, at least in economic terms.
Yet neither system is adequate to either the needs of the worker or the
needs of enterprise and economy.</p>
<p>One basic weakness of the Western system is that it lacks
selectivity. Every group in the work force gets the same benefits
whether they truly benefit the group or not. As a result, no group gets
in full the benefits that would mean the most for it. And every group
gets benefits which it does not truly need and therefore does not
greatly value, but for which it pays, of course, one way or another.</p>
<p>A reason for this is the pervasive belief of employees—on all
levels—that there are “free benefits.” If the employer pays for them,
many employees believe they do not cost anything. The labor unions are
among the foremost victims of this particular delusion. Needless to say,
there are no free benefits. All benefits are part of the cost of
enterprise and economy. Since some two-thirds of personal income in
every developed society is wages and salaries (which does not include
the incomes of farmers, small shopkeepers, and independent
professionals) there is no one but the recipients of wages and salaries
who could possibly pay for benefits.</p>
<p>Another reason why benefits in the West are not structured to give
the most benefit to the recipient is the belief of the labor unions that
what costs the enterprise the most is thereby of most benefit for the
employee. The labor union measures the value of benefits by how much
they “hurt” enterprise.</p>
<p>In addition, most benefits in the West are not related to the
performance of the enter- prise—or at least, not in visible form. They
are fixed. What is needed, however, are plans that have a “floor” with
contributions actually determined though fluctuating from year to year
according to the company’s profits and productivity. But there needs to
be no “ceil- ing.” Extraordinary profitability or productivity might, as
at Sears, Roebuck, make possi- ble sizable increases in benefit levels
without creating a permanent burden.</p>
<p>The Japanese system provides probably greater worker satisfaction
with a lower bur- den on enterprise and economy. This is a result of its
selectivity, that is, of its ability to tailor the benefits of one group
or one employee to specific needs. But at the same time, the Japanese
system is arbitrary. Management decides what is good for the employee.
There is no plan and little predictability. As a result, there is
increasing pressure in Japan for clear, agreed-upon contractual plans,
that is, for the Western approach.</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese system does even less than the Western
system to relate benefits to profitability and productivity. In Japan,
far more than in the West, employee benefits are capital investment: a
small dowry for the woman worker upon her marriage; housing built by the
employer or low-interest mortgage loans to enable the employee to build
his own home; the two-year salary that still serves as retirement
payment for most workers. Yet this capital fund for the worker is rarely
related to the enterprise’s or the</p>
<p>economy’s capital fund, that is, to profitability or rising
productivity. In the West most employees know—if only vaguely—that a
declining business will cut back on benefits. Whenever that happens in
Japan, it seems to come as a tremendous shock and surprise.</p>
<p>What Benefits Should Be</p>
<p>It is not surprising that benefits yield so little of their potential
benefit. Almost no benefit plan anywhere in the world was planned,
designed, thought through. Practically all of them just grew. Indeed,
Americans still call them “fringes”—even though benefits are a little
more than a quarter of the total labor cost of American business, which
is somewhat wide for a fringe. And in Europe, let alone in Japan, this
fringe is even wider.</p>
<p>In most businesses, Western or Japanese, benefits are the third
largest cost next to wages and materials. Yet while individual benefit
programs, e.g., the retirement plan or the health-care plan, are
managed, the benefit system essentially unmanaged. To leave so large a
cost center unmanaged is poor management. And far more is at stake in
benefits than cost. It is high time that management assume true
managerial responsibility for bene- fits.</p>
<p>We can specify what benefits should be and should do.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Benefits need to be structured so as to give the beneficiary, the
worker, the most for the money.</li>
</ol>
<p>A good example of what not to do is America’s most widely used health
insurance plan, the nonprofit Blue Cross Plan which is particularly
popular with labor unions. Blue Cross health coverage has become
increasingly expensive. Yet it does not provide for payment of medical
and hospital bills when the worker needs it the most, that is, when he
is out of work. But it pays full expenses for the minor illnesses of his
family while he is employed—which is a major reason for the high
premium. Yet an employed worker in the United States earns more than
enough to pay for minor illnesses of his nonworking family members. A 00
“deductible” for medical costs of nonworking dependents would pay for
substantial medical cost coverage for up to two years of unemployment.
This would be of far greater benefit to the insured than reimbursement
for sums which he can easily pay when employed and working.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>The floor of benefits needs to be fixed. But it should be
financed on a fluctuating basis with a clear relationship to
profitability and perhaps to productivity, and higher benefits
(especially retirement benefits) in the event of extraordinary
profitability and productivity gains. There needs to be a minimum
contribution on the part of the employer. And any deficiency in the
benefit fund must be made up on a regular periodic basis. But the more
flexibility the employer has, the greater his contribution can be. At
the same time, the closer and more visible the relationship is between
benefits and a company’s profits, the more will benefits help to
attenuate the conflict between wage fund and capital fund.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of individual benefits programs, each with its own
contribution, it might be well to decide first the total size of the
benefit package and then work out options to give to each group the
combination of benefits that best serves its needs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There need to be safeguards, of course. I would imagine that no
worker would be al- lowed to opt out of health insurance. But a worker
might be given the option between a health insurance plan that
reimburses him in full for all medical and hospital expenses for himself
and his family, and one in which he pays for the first few hundred
dollars of medical expenses each year out of his own pocket. That would
enable him to increase the contribution to his pension plan or to get
low-interest loans for the college expenses of his children or for
building a house.</p>
<p>I, personally, would go much further. I would strongly favor plans
under which work- ers are entitled to cut their cash wage, up to a
substantial percentage, to improve their benefits. In the West, where
younger workers (unlike Japan) are paid essentially the same as older
men doing similar work, a younger worker who does not yet have
substantial family obligations or mortgage payments on a house might be
encouraged, for instance, to</p>
<p>withhold a share of his cash earnings to be put into his retirement
annuity. After all, a dollar paid into an annuity account at age
twenty-five buys a great deal more than a dollar paid into the same
account twenty years later.</p>
<p>Wherever plans of this kind have been offered, they have met with
tremendous re- sponse, both on the part of younger workers in general
and especially on the part of knowledge workers of all ages. Examples
are some stock purchase plans and savings plans of American companies.
The Internal Revenue Service has encouraged such a plan for some
employees of nonprofit institutions such as college professors who can
withhold a substantial part of their salary to be invested in their
retirement pension, with the income taxable only when received, that is,
after retirement and presumably at a much lower rate. This plan has been
chosen by a very large proportion of the men eligible under it— proving
that it makes sense to a great many workers to manage cash incomes and
benefits as one income stream.</p>
<p>At the same time we might give workers at certain stages of their
family life the option to take down part of the benefit money as
additional cash wage. This would be bitterly fought by the labor unions,
since it would create what labor unions fear the most: unequal cash
wages for equal work (though total actual income; i.e., cash wages plus
benefits, would of course remain the same). But it would make sense,
especially if the same worker has earlier, that is, before the time of
heavy family obligations, withheld part of his cash income and put the
money into benefits.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The administration of benefits should as much as possible be made a
responsibility of the work community.</li>
</ol>
<p>Investing pension-fund money requires high professional skill. And so
does running a mortgage bank for employee housing. But the work
community needs to participate, if only to learn. And it should be
primarily responsible for the design of benefit programs and benefit
options for various groups in the work force. No one else knows what the
true needs are. No one else can convince the work force that choices
have to be made and that the available options represent the best
balance of choices.</p>
<p>Workers the world over have shown two strong preferences as incomes
went up.</p>
<p>One is the preference for leisure over more cash income. What part of
the added pro- ductivity of a modern economy is taken in the form of
leisure rather than in the form of cash income is hard to compute. But
at all levels (except the top) workers clearly consider leisure a major
employee benefit.</p>
<p>The second preference has been for benefits. This is a rational
preference. Retirement pensions and life insurance protection; medical
and health care; housing and education, are all values which are best
procured on a collective basis, that is, on the basis of cer- tainty for
the recipient and probability distribution of risk and cost. And these
are the val- ues which loom the larger the more basic economic needs are
satisfied.</p>
<p>Benefits, one can predict, are likely to continue to be a major
worker demand and a major worker need. Benefits are, therefore, likely
to become a larger rather than a smaller part of the labor costs of an
economy. At the same time, they become increasingly the channel through
which the capital fund is being fed. It is, therefore, incumbent on man-
agement to assume responsibility for employee benefits. It is no longer
adequate to con- sider them fringes, as managements do in the West, or
benevolence, as managements do in Japan.</p>
