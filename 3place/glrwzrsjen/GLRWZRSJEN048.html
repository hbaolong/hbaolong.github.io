<p>I</p>
<p>N “FEDERAL DECENTRALIZATION”* a company is organized in a number of
autonomous businesses. Each unit has responsibility for its own
performance, its own results, and is own contribution to the total
company. Each unit has its own manage- ment which, in effect, runs its
own “autonomous business.”</p>
<p>Federal decentralization (as has been mentioned earlier, in Chapter
41) was first worked out, though only crudely, by Pierre S. du Pont in
1920 in the reorganization of the family-owned Du Pont Company, which
had outgrown, during World War I, an older functional structure. When
Pierre S. du Pont, shortly thereafter, took over the presidency of
General Motors, which was then in desperate trouble, he found that
Alfred P. Sloan, then GM’s executive vice-president, had arrived at a
similar, though far more polished version. Sloan’s “decentralized
operations with centralized policy control”—put into ef- fect during
1921-22—became the prototype of decentralization. Among the many imita-
tions and adaptations, the one made in 1950-52 for the reorganization of
the General Electric Company became, in the years of the “management
boom,” the standard model worldwide.†</p>
<p>*The commonly used term is “decentralization” (“divisionalization” in
Japan). But this is confusing as there are other forms of
“decentralization.” It is also misleading. The best name for this design
principle would be the “federal principle.”</p>
<p>†For Sloan’s prototype see my book, Concept of the Corporation.</p>
<p>“If only efforts are organized properly, the right results will
follow” is the underlying premise. Decentralization, by contrast, starts
out with the question “What results do we aim for?” It tries to set up
the right business first, that is, the unit that will have optimal
capacity for results and especially for results in the marketplace. Then
the question is asked “What work, what efforts, what key activities have
to be set up and organized</p>
<p>within the autonomous business?”</p>
<p>It is desirable, of course, to set up the same or, at least, a
similar functional structure for all or most of the autonomous
businesses within a company. All Sears stores, regard- less of size or
location, have, for instance, a store controller, an operations manager,
and department heads for major merchandise areas such as appliances. All
GM manufacturing divisions have the same seven key functions:
engineering, manufacturing, master- mechanic, purchasing, marketing
accounting, and personnel, with the head of each report- ing directly to
the division’s general manager.</p>
<p>But care should be taken lest this desirable unity become stifling
uniformity.</p>
<p>The GE reorganization of 1950-52 provides an example of what not to
do. GE de- cided that the “typical manufacturing business” has five key
functions: engineering, manufacturing, marketing, accounting, and
personnel. That this did not fit non- manufacturing businesses such as
the General Electric Credit Corporation, everyone saw, of course. But
two things were not seen—with resulting high damage. First, it was not
realized that some manufacturing businesses needed additional and
different key func- tions, or at least a different arrangement of the
same functional work. One example was the computer business, where
product development and customer service were far too important to be
subordinated to engineering and marketing. GE’s failure in the computer
business had many causes, but the imposition of the functional structure
of a typical manufacturing business was probably a major contributor.
Second, there were some busi- nesses that looked like manufacturing
businesses but were, in effect, innovative busi- nesses. These units
were genuine businesses and result centers, but they had no “product”;
they were set up to develop one. They had no “market,” but a research
and development contract, mostly from the U.S. government. They did not
“manufacture”; at most they had a model shop to build a few prototypes.
Yet the functions of a typical manufacturing business were imposed on
them. Some of these innovative development businesses man- aged to
survive by quiet sabotage of the official structure. The others were
seriously dam- aged—some irreparably—by having to carry a heavy load of
functions they did not need and, above all, by misdirection of vision
and efforts.</p>
<p>This is misuse of the true strength of federal decentralization: the
focus on results. In using federal decentralization, the first question
should always be “What is the business of this ‘autonomous’ business?
What will it be? What should it be?” Then the key activities emerge and
can be organized effectively on functional or team lines.</p>
<p>The Strengths of Federal Decentralization</p>
<p>Of all design principles available so far, federal decentralization
comes closest to satisfy- ing all design specifications. It also has the
widest scope. Both operating work and inno- vative work can be organized
as decentralized autonomous businesses. And while top management can
obviously not be set up as an autonomous business, federal decentraliza-
tion of the business, if done properly, makes for strong and effective
top managements. It frees top management for the top-management
tasks.</p>
<p>Federal decentralization has great clarity and considerable economy.
It makes it easy for each member of the autonomous business to
understand his own task and to under- stand the task of the whole
business. It has high stability and is yet adaptable.</p>
<p>It focuses the vision and efforts of managers directly on business
performance and re- sults. The danger of self-deception, of
concentrating on the familiar but old and tired rather than on the
difficult but new and growing, or of allowing unprofitable lines to be
carried on the backs of the profitable ones, is much lessened. Reality
is not easily ob- scured by overhead or hidden in the figures for total
sales.</p>
<p>With respect to communications and decisions, the federal
organization is the only satisfactory design principle we possess. Since
the entire management group, or at least the upper ranks within it,
share a common vision and a common perception, they tend to communicate
easily. And usually, for that reason, communication between people in
dif- ferent kinds of work is encouraged all the way down the line rather
than frowned upon. Decision-making is also likely to be placed at the
optimal level without great effort. The focus tends to be on the right
rather than the wrong issue, and on the important rather than the
trivial decision.</p>
<p>used in preference to any other.</p>
<p>In a federally organized structure, each manager is close enough to
business perform- ance and business results to focus on them. He is
close enough to results to get immediate feedback from business
performance on his own task and work, even though he himself may be
purely functional in his job. The federal principle therefore enables us
to divide large and complex organizations into a number of businesses
that are small and simple enough so that managers know what they are
doing and can direct themselves toward the performance of the whole
instead of becoming prisoners of their own work, effort, and skill.</p>
<p>A Sears, Roebuck vice-president may have three hundred stores under
him—each an autonomous unit, responsible for marketing and for profits.
Each store manager may have thirty section managers under him, each
running his own autonomous unit and also re- sponsible for marketing and
profitability goals. As a result, there are only two levels in Sears
between the lowest management job, section manager in a store, and the
president: the store manager and the regional vice-president.</p>
<p>Above all, the general manager of the decentralized business, if only
in charge of a small business, is truly top management. He faces most of
the challenge’s of the top- management job in an independent company—the
one exception being, as a rule, the re- sponsibility for financial
resources and their supply. He has to make decisions. He has to build a
team. He has to think about markets and processes, people and money,
today and tomorrow. As a result, he is being tested in an autonomous,
albeit not an independent, command. Yet he is being tested fairly early
in his career, and at a reasonably low level. A mistake can, therefore,
be unmade without too much damage to the company, and, equally
important, without too much damage to the man. No other known principle
of organization, whether in business or in any other institution,
satisfies the need to prepare and test men for tomorrow’s leadership
positions nearly as well as the federal principle does.</p>
<p>The search for a system which will prepare and test tomorrow’s
leaders is the oldest problem of political theory and political
practice. No political system has ever solved it adequately. The
principle of federal decentralization, of course, does not solve it
fully. The autonomous manager of a decentralized business is still not
faced with the full re- sponsibility, let alone with the full
loneliness, of the top position. But the federal principle comes closer
to a solution than any other known design.</p>
<p>The principle of federal decentralization was developed for business
purposes. But it is just as applicable to non-businesses, that is, to
service institutions.</p>
<p>The hospital of tomorrow may be reorganized in autonomous federal
units. One such unit might, for instance, take care of the fairly small
number of hospital patients—about a quarter to one-third at any one time
in a general hospital—who need intensive care or clinical care. Another
unit might take care of the large load of ambulatory or short-stay
patients who require neither intensive clinical care nor surgery. Yet
another unit might take care of the large number of surgical patients
who require no hospitalization or only a</p>
<p>short stay of a day or two in a “hotel” bed rather than the far more
expensive “hospital” bed. Another autonomous component might be a mental
health unit, again mostly for am- bulatory patients. Another unit might
be the convalescent unit. There might further be a “hotel” unit—which in
effect is all the healthy mother and her healthy baby need two days
after the delivery of the child. All these units would, of course, share
common services— laboratories, dietitians and the kitchen, social and
maintenance workers, psychiatric case workers, physical therapists, and
so on. But these services are organized as central ser- vices anyhow
today.</p>
<p>The federal principle is equally adaptable to the organizing of
subunits within autonomous federal businesses.</p>
<p>Each of the autonomous departments which Pierre du Pont set up in
1920 has grown so much that it split itself internally into a number of
autonomous businesses—in Du Pont they are called divisions—each with its
own general manager, who has profit and loss responsibility and runs an
entire business with all its functions (except accounting, which is a
departmental function if not a corporate one). In some of these
sub-businesses there are even smaller autonomous units, each with its
own product lines, its own market, and its own business
responsibility.</p>
<p>The Requirements of Federal Decentralization</p>
<p>Federal decentralization has stringent requirements. It also makes
very substantial de- mands for responsibility and self-discipline.</p>
<p>Decentralization must not create a weak center. On the contrary, one
of the main pur- poses of federal organization is to strengthen top
management and to make it capable of doing its own work rather than be
forced to supervise, coordinate, and prop up operating work. Federal
decentralization will work only if the top-management job is clearly de-
fined and thought through.</p>
<p>The crucial question in any federal system is “What are the tasks of
top management, and how can top management get the time, the thought,
the perspective to discharge</p>
<p>them?” Federalization, if properly applied, makes top management
capable of doing its own job precisely because it does not have to worry
about operations, but can concentrate on direction, strategy,
objectives, and key decisions for the future.</p>
<p>“Decentralization” is therefore a misleading term—though it is by now
far too popular to be discarded.</p>
<p>The test of effective federal decentralization is top-management
strength. Top man- agement in a decentralized company must first accept
its responsibility for thinking through “what our business is and what
it should be.” It must accept the responsibility for setting the
objectives for the entire company and for working out the strategies for
obtain- ing these objectives. It must, in other words, accept the
responsibility for its own job. If a federal structure is the
best-functioning of all structures if properly managed, it is a sham-
bles if top management abdicates and does not live up to the
responsibilities of its own tasks.</p>
<p>Top management must think through carefully what decision it reserves
for itself. For there are decisions which have to do with the entire
company, its integrity, and its future. It does not necessarily follow
that every such decision has to be made on “overall consid- erations.”
On the contrary, most of them should be made on the basis of what is
good for an individual autonomous business. But these decisions can be
made only by somebody who sees the whole and is responsible for the
whole.</p>
<p>At General Electric, for instance, only corporate top management can
make the deci- sion to abandon a business or go into a new one. At
General Motors, top management at the central office sets the price
ranges within which each automobile division’s products have to fall,
and thus controls the competition between the major units of the
company. At Sears, Chicago headquarters decides what kinds of goods—hard
goods, appliances, fash- ion goods, and so forth—each store must
carry.</p>
<p>Top management in a decentralized structure has to be separate. It
cannot also run any of the autonomous businesses no matter how big or
important they are. Even in a small company that is organized in the
federal design at least one man (and preferably more— on this see
Chapters 50 and 51) needs to be charged exclusively with responsibility
for the top-management task for the entire business.</p>
<p>The traditional English system in which the “executive directors” of
the board, i.e., the full-time members of top management, tend to be the
heads of the major divisions and subsidiaries, therefore results in
there being neither top management nor decentralization. Basic decisions
are either not made at all or they are made by “swapping” between divi-
sion heads concerned—properly—with their own divisions rather than with
the company.* This may well be one of the main reasons for the
often-reported tendency of English companies to allocate capital and
other resources according to past history and size of a division rather
than according to opportunity, thus starving tomorrow.</p>
<p>Federal decentralization requires centralized controls and common
measurements. In- deed, wherever a federal organization gets in trouble
(wherever, for instance, layers of central management staffs are being
heaped on top of a federal structure), the reason is always that the
measurements at the disposal of the center are not good enough, so that
personal supervision has to be substituted. Both the managers of the
autonomous busi- nesses and top management must know what is expected of
each business, what is meant by “performance,” and what developments are
important. To be able to give autonomy one must have confidence. And
this requires controls that make opinions unnecessary. To be able to
manage by objectives one must know whether goals are being reached or
not; and this requires clear and reliable measurements.</p>
<p>The need for what Sloan called “centralized controls” is illustrated
by the experience of one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing
multinationals, Philips of Holland. Be- tween 1959 and 1972, Philips’s
worldwide sales increased almost fivefold: from .3 billion to billion.
But profits all but disappeared. The company had a strong top-
management team. It had technical and product leadership in a number of
major areas, from household appliances to electronics to light bulbs. It
represented an extreme in de- centralization, with hundreds of
subsidiary companies in sixty countries, each traditionally with its own
autonomous management. But it had virtually no control system such as
cen- tral planning, and no common measurements. The result was
fragmentation instead of</p>
<p>*On this see the case studies in David Granick, Managerial
Comparisons of Four Developed Countries: France, Britain, United States
and Russia (M.I.T. Press, 1972).</p>
<p>decentralization, excessive and uncontrolled inventories, unplanned
capital investment, and overstaffing. Philips, in terms of safes, is
only two-thirds the size of the General Elec- tric Company, but in
capital investment and number of employees it matches GE—while its
profits are barely a fifth of those of GE. It was only when Philips in
several years of hard work injected centralized controls, common
measurement, and coordinated planning that the company began to reap the
rewards of its technical and marketing achievements. And only then did
the “autonomous business managers” of the various Philips companies
really acquire autonomy; only then could they plan for their businesses,
set objectives, and organize their own work.</p>
<p>The converse of this is that the federal principle demands great
responsibility from the operating units, the autonomous businesses. They
are given the maximum of autonomy;</p>
<p>Size Requirements</p>
<p>Federal decentralization was designed as an answer to a problem of
size: the deterioration that sets in functional structures when they
reach more than medium size. But federal de- centralization also has
size requirements. When the federal unit becomes so large that the
components within it, that is, the functional subunits (e.g.,
manufacturing) exceed the size at which they function, the whole
autonomous business becomes unwieldy, sluggish, and too big to perform.
The “brain,” that is, the top management of the autonomous unit, may
still perform. But the “members,” that is, the functional components,
turn rigid and bu- reaucratic and will increasingly serve themselves
rather than the common purpose.</p>
<p>Du Pont has been counteracting this in part by splitting autonomous
businesses in two as they grow bigger, in part (as said earlier) by
setting up small autonomous decentralized businesses within large
autonomous decentralized businesses. Another approach is that of Johnson
andandandand Johnson, the very large, multinational producer of
health-care products rang- ing from absorbent cotton to birth-control
pills. J andandandand J for many years tried to limit the size of each
business to 250 employees, each run as a separate company with its own
complete management and its own board of directors, and each “reporting”
directly to a small, cen- tral parent-company top-management team. While
J andandandand J, with worldwide sales of over a billion dollars and
40,000 employees, has been forced to accept individual businesses a good
deal larger than 250 employees, it still limits the size of each
business and will split it rather than permit it to grow large. As a
result, functional units are still quite small in every J andandandand J
business.</p>
<p>But breaking up or subdividing autonomous businesses as they grow to
large size is not always possible; or at least it is not always done.
And the result is then the emergence of “functional empires.”</p>
<p>The Chevrolet division of General Motors, for instance, has grown so
large that it would by itself be the world’s third or fourth largest
manufacturing company if it were</p>
<p>independent. It is a decentralized autonomous product business. But
internally it is func- tionally organized and highly centralized. GM
tries to counteract the resulting insulation of the large—very
large—functional units by frequently moving functional managers from
Chevrolet into the other and smaller (though still large) automotive
divisions and moving functional managers from other divisions into
Chevrolet. But when GM in the early seventies took responsibility for
final assembly away from Chevrolet and moved it into a separate assembly
division organized on the “simulated decentralization” principle (see
below), one explanation given for this move was the need to restore
“result-focus” to a large assembly operation that was becoming
“effort-focused.” And a good many, espe- cially of the younger, GM
executives apparently believe that Chevrolet should long ago have been
split up into a number of separate divisions, one, for instance, in
charge of the large truck business; another one, perhaps, in charge of
the smaller cars such as “com- pacts” and “subcompacts,” with the
original Chevrolet division confined to “standard- sized” passenger
automobiles. (See below, Chapter 55.)</p>
<p>Ralph Cordiner, the architect of GE’s reorganization in the fifties,
used to say that an autonomous business in a decentralized structure
should be so small that “a good man can get his arms around it.” This is
hardly a precise quantitative term. But it would imply that an
autonomous business should be no more than “fair-sized” to get the full
benefits of federal decentralization. This means (as discussed in
Chapter 54) that a small group of men at the top—four or five maybe—can
still tell without having to consult charts, re- cords, or organization
manuals, who the key people are in the unit, where they are, what their
assignments are and how they perform, where they came from and where
they are likely to go. If autonomous businesses get much larger federal
decentralization may still be the best alternative. But it is then the
“lesser evil” rather than the optimum.</p>
<p>How Small Is Too Small?</p>
<p>But the decentralized autonomous unit also needs to be big enough to
support the man- agement it needs.</p>
<p>How small is too small depends on the business. A Sears store, or a
Marks andandandand Spencer store, can be quite small and yet support
adequate management. All a small store needs is one manager and a few
department heads who actually manage on the selling floor.</p>
<p>In the U.S., mass-production metalworking industry, a truly
autonomous product busi- ness, is rarely capable of supporting adequate
management and its own engineering, manufacturing, and marketing work
unless it sells twenty to thirty million dollars’ worth of merchandise a
year. Businesses with a significantly lower sales volume are in danger
of being understaffed, or staffed with inadequate people.</p>
<p>When such very small units are organized as autonomous businesses,
their internal structure should be team design rather than functional
structure. This is the way in which all but the largest of the
individual Sears stores actually work.</p>
<p>The decisive criterion is not size but the scope and challenge of the
management job.</p>
<p>A federal unit should always have enough scope so that a good man can
show his ability. It should have enough challenge so that the management
group in the unit truly has to manage: that is, to think through
objectives and plans, to build human resources into an effective team,
to integrate the work, and to measure its performance. It should have
enough challenge so that management will have to work on all major
phases of a business, but also enough challenge so that it can really
develop a market, a product or service— and, above all, can truly
develop people. The true criterion of size for an autonomous business
unit is not economics. It is managerial scope and challenge, and
managerial per- formance.</p>
<p>The autonomous businesses of a decentralized organization should not
have to depend on central service staffs, that is, on advisory and
teaching activities operating out of head- quarters.</p>
<p>A decentralized organization needs effective “conscience” work. It
needs, especially if large and diversified, organized thinking and
planning for top management, that is, the</p>
<p>“secretariat” or “business research” group discussed in Chapter 51.
It needs strong central information and unified controls and
measurements. It will have some “common operat- ing work,” e.g., the
supply and management of money, research, legal counsel, relations with
the public, organized labor, and government, and perhaps purchasing. It
may have to organize company-wide work on the kind of “social
RandandandandD” discussed in Chapter 25 and on innovation in key
activities whether marketing or managing people.</p>
<p>But it should neither need nor use central service staffs to “advise”
the operating man- agements of the decentralized units. These units
should be strong enough to stand on their own feet. If they are not,
service staffs will not cure their weakness but compound it. Such
service staffs are, of necessity, focused on their functional area
rather than on business performance and business results. Being located
at the central office, they inevitably have the inside track to top
management. In decentralized companies where service staffs are big and
busy pleasing the staff people thus becomes more important than running
the business for performance.</p>
<p>The pioneers of federal decentralization knew this and kept service
staffs small and lean. Many of the companies that adopted federal
decentralization in the fifties or sixties have, however, built massive
central service staffs.</p>
<p>They may have had little choice. Setting up these central services in
functional areas was, in many cases, the only politically feasible thing
to do. Otherwise, the strong tradi- tional functional structures would
have blocked the shift to federal decentralization, which of course,
threatened their power and prominence. Even the rhetoric used to justify
these large staff services—e.g., “the need for excellence” or “for
professionalism” in functional areas—was often a necessary political
price. But at least this should be recognized. Ser- vice staffs created
to placate powerful functional barons should be phased out as the peo-
ple in them retire. New people should not be brought in. New work should
be sanctioned only if old projects and activities are being sloughed
off. And, after a transition period of a few years, that part of the
budget of such staffs that goes for “service” to autonomous businesses
might be limited to what the “customers,” i.e., the people in the
autonomous businesses, voluntarily “buy” rather than be raised by a
compulsory levy.</p>
<p>Dependence on central staff service can only impose on a
decentralized organization the weaknesses and vulnerabilities, without
giving it the benefits and strengths, of func- tional design.</p>
<p>What Is a “Business”?</p>
<p>Federal decentralization is applicable only where a company can truly
be organized into a number of genuine “businesses.” This is its basic
limitation.</p>
<p>But what is a “business”? Ideally, of course, a federal unit should
be a complete busi- ness in its own right.</p>
<p>This idea underlay Alfred P. Sloan, Jr.’s, organization of General
Motors in the early 1920s. Each of the automotive divisions did its own
design, its own engineering, its own manufacturing, its own marketing,
and its own sales. The divisions were limited as to the price range in
which they could offer automobiles but totally autonomous otherwise.
GM’s accessory divisions sold a large share of their output to the
automotive divisions of their own company. But they were organized to
sell an even larger share directly to the outside market and indeed,
very often, to General Motors’s own competitors. They too were
“businesses” in every sense of the word. And so are the autonomous
companies into which Johnson andandandand Johnson has organized itself.
Each has its own product lines, its own research and development, its
own markets and marketing.</p>
<p>But how much of the reality of a genuine business does there have to
be for federal decentralization to work effectively? As a minimum the
unit must contribute a profit to the company rather than merely
contribute to the profit of the company. Its profit or loss should
directly become company profit or loss. In fact, the company’s total
profit should be the sum total of the profits of the individual
businesses. And it must be a genuine</p>
<p>profit—not arrived at by manipulating accounting figures, but
determined by the objective judgment of the marketplace.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more important—and the genuine touchstone of autonomy—is
that the federal unit must have a market of its own. The market may be
only a geographic entity— as in the Sears or the Marks andandandand
Spencer stores, or in the case of the “regional companies” into which
several large American life insurance companies have divided themselves.
But still there has to be a distinct market within which the unit is, so
to speak, the company.</p>
<p>In some industries there may be more than one distinct market for the
same product lines in the same geographic area, and therefore scope for
two distinct businesses with similar products.</p>
<p>Institutional buyers of chairs—hospitals, schools, restaurants,
hotels, large offices— are a different market from homeowners. They may
buy the same or very similar mer- chandise. But they use different
distributive channels, pay different prices, buy in differ- ent ways.
One fair-sized furniture company attributes its growth largely to having
set up retail furniture and institutional furniture as separate product
businesses.</p>
<p>As long as a business can have full market responsibility and
objective comparability of results, it can obtain its products from
another autonomous unit or from a centralized company-run manufacturing
source, and yet be an autonomous business.</p>
<p>Neither the Sears store nor the Marks andandandand Spencer store are
true “businesses.” They do not do their own buying, do not even decide
what merchandise to carry and what prices to charge. Yet in its
geographic area each store stands on its own. And because all Sears or
Marks andandandand Spencer stores get the same merchandise at the same
cost from the same central buying office, they can be compared
meaningfully to one another. Within the system, the Sears store manager
is autonomous and can be measured by performance and results.</p>
<p>Where, however, no genuine market test exists, we should not speak of
an autonomous business. Federal decentralization then does not work.</p>
<p>GE had had one big autonomous business, the apparatus sales division,
to sell and supply turbines, switch gear, and transformers to the
electric power companies. This divi- sion worked closely with the
individual power companies on the overall design of power stations and
transmission lines, and then assembled from the various GE plants, as
well as from outside, whatever equipment was needed to satisfy an
individual customer. Under the GE reorganization of 1952 the “product
departments,” i.e., switchgears or transform- ers” were given “business
responsibility,” and the apparatus sales division besame a “dis-
tributor.” This did not work. The product departments could not truly
assume business responsibility. And the apparatus sales division, while
the only real “business,” no longer had the needed authority. Confusion
instead of clarity was created; friction instead of re- sponsibility.
Eventually most of the old structure had to be restored, even though the
ap- paratus sales division is far bigger than what “one man can get his
arms around.”</p>
<p>So far we have been discussing federal decentralization of operating
work, that is, of existing and known businesses. A decentralized unit
for innovative work is structured and measured differently (see Chapter
6). But federal decentralization is also the most effec- tive design
principle for such work—on condition, however, that its performance and
results can be objectively measured. A decentralized innovative unit
also has to be a busi- ness—or must be capable of becoming one.</p>
<p>Simulated Decentralization</p>
<p>Whenever a unit can be set up as a business no design principle can
match federal decen- tralization. We have learned, however, that a great
many large companies cannot be di- vided into genuine businesses. Yet
they have clearly outgrown the limits of size and com- plexity of the
functional or of the team structure.</p>
<p>These are the companies that are increasingly turning to “simulated
decentralization”</p>
<p>as the answer to their organization problem.</p>
<p>Simulated decentralization forms structural units which are not
businesses but which are still set up as if they were businesses, with
maximum possible autonomy, with their</p>
<p>own management, and with at least a “simulation” of profit and loss
responsibility. They buy from and sell to each other using “transfer
prices” determined internally rather than by an outside market. Or their
“profits” are arrived at by internal allocation of costs to which then,
often, a “standard fee” such as 20 percent of costs, is added.</p>
<p>The prime examples are companies in the chemical and “materials”
industries.</p>
<p>An integrated chemical company runs on three axes or on three
different logics: the logic of research, the logic of process, and the
logic of the market. In research and devel- opment, the categories that
inform organization are given by knowledge definitions, such as
“polymers,” “bonding,” and “surface phenomena.” The process, in turn,
tends to be raw-material determined. No process can conceivably turn
sulfuric acid into petrochemi- cals or petrochemicals into sulfuric
acid. The market, finally, has a logic all its own. It buys neither
“inorganic” chemicals nor “organic” chemicals. It buys adhesives, glue,
coat- ings, reagents, cleansers. It buys, in other words, what a product
will do rather than chemical formula or process technology. And most
customers buy a bewildering variety of different chemicals for all kinds
of purposes. The logic of the market is “end-use” logic.</p>
<p>Yet the large chemical company, whether Du Pont and Monsanto in the
U.S., ICI in Britain, Pechiney in France, or Badische in Germany, must
be able to:</p>
<p>• develop new products across a wide range of chemical disciplines
and tech- nologies;</p>
<p>• produce a wide variety of products from a large number of raw
materials; and</p>
<p>• supply a wide variety of end users with the chemicals they need for
their own manufacturing process.</p>
<p>The same applies, in somewhat lesser degree, to glass, steel,
aluminum, and paper manufacturers. These “materials” businesses were the
success stories before World War I. They were still leaders in the
period between the two wars. Their growth in terms of sales and volume
since World War II has been even faster than in earlier periods. But
results have been increasingly disappointing. And the reason, as more
and more have come to realize, is that they have outgrown functional
organization. They have lost the ability for effective communications,
for flexibility, for making decisions fast, and for carrying out
decisions once made.</p>
<p>It has been often said of such major American materials companies as
Aluminum Company of America that they make the right decisions, but make
them nine months too late and then take another nine months before
putting them into action—and the same criticism has been leveled against
the chemical giants, whether in the U.S., in Britain, or in Germany. It
simply takes too long for a decision to travel the way it has to travel
in a large functional structure; all the way up to the top and then all
the way down again. And both the problems to be decided and the
decisions reached are likely to be garbled out of all recognition on
their way through countless levels.</p>
<p>Simulated decentralization is the one available design principle that
copes with the structural problems of the big materials business.</p>
<p>Many chemical manufacturers have, for instance, organized their
business in three sets of units, each based on simulated
decentralization. A research and development corpora- tion is set up and
organized by major fields of study and inquiry. Some companies, e.g.,
Monsanto, have set up separate marketing components and separate
manufacturing com- ponents, both with profit and loss
responsibility.</p>
<p>The Japanese steel companies market through separate “trading
companies,” both at home and abroad. In the Aluminum Company of America
and in Republic Steel produc- tion is organized in geographic
manufacturing units, each considered a profit and loss center.
Marketing, however, is organized in end-use units, that is, by major
industrial buyers of aluminum or steel, such as the automobile industry
and the construction indus- try. Corning Glass, one of the world’s
largest manufacturers of glass, is similarly organ-</p>
<p>ized by manufacturing units and by marketing units, each set up on
the basis of simulated decentralization.</p>
<p>Simulated decentralization is equally applicable in single-product
companies of simi- lar size and complexity. IBM may be the leading
example.</p>
<p>IBM, by and large, has one main product: computers. Only one of the
markets can be split off as autonomous, the government and defense
market. The great bulk of IBM’s business, some 80 percent or so,
supplies one product to one market, i.e., computers to business, both in
the United States and abroad. Yet the computer business, with its many
billions of dollars of sales and its great complexity is much too big to
be organized by functions. Accordingly, IBM has split its data
processing (for which read “computer”) business into two key units, each
considered an autonomous business, on the basis of simulated
decentralization. Marketing and services is one, and development and
manufac- turing is the other. Each unit is considered a profit and loss
center.</p>
<p>The most interesting attempts to apply simulated decentralization to
very large busi- nesses which cannot apply federal decentralization were
the reorganizations of major New York commercial banks in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Both the First National City Bank and the Chase Manhattan Bank,
respectively New York’s first and second banks in deposits, have
reorganized themselves into simulated decentralized structures. City
Bank split itself into five autonomous units, each headed by a
“president”: retail (i.e., the individual depositor and borrower),
commercial (i:e., small and medium-sized businesses), corporate (i.e.,
large businesses), international, and fiduci- ary services such as
investment management. Each unit has its own objectives, its own plans,
and its own profit and loss statements. The Chase organization, though
developed independently, is roughly similar.</p>
<p>These bank examples also show clearly some of the major problems of
simulated de- centralization. In both banks it is the large branch, such
as the Rockefeller Center branch of each bank, or the branch in London,
which is the geographic focus of the bank’s busi- ness. Sometimes the
branch acts merely as the landlord and facilities manager for the rep-
resentatives of each of the five “autonomous banks” that occupy space in
the branch. Sometimes the branch is the “banker.” At different times it
is both. Clearly, the large branch is also a “business” and a profit and
loss center. And who coordinates the different “banks” and focuses them
on the individual customer who often is—or should be—a “re- tail,” a
“commercial,” a “fiduciary,” and even a “corporate” customer all at
once? The head of a small business, for instance, will use the bank
which finances his firm for his personal banking business and for his
savings account, will expect it to act as executor of his will, to be
the manager for his investments and the trustee for his firm’s pension
fund. He does not want to deal with four different banks. Whose customer
is he, and who gets the credit for his business?</p>
<p>Simulated decentralization is obviously difficult and full of
problems. Yet it will be used even more in the future. For the growth
areas of economy and society—process in- dustries and private and
governmental service institutions—are the sectors in which simu- lated
decentralization has its greatest potential of application. In these
sectors neither functional organization nor federal decentralization can
do the organizing job. Managers therefore need to know the requirements
and limitations of simulated decentralization. What problems can be
expected in an organization built on it?</p>
<p>The Problems of Simulated Decentralization</p>
<p>Simulated decentralization is a poor “fit” with respect to all design
specifications. It is not clear. It does not make for an easy focus on
performance. It rarely satisfies the specifica- tion that everyone
should be able to know his own task. Neither does it satisfy the demand
that managers and professionals should be able to understand the job of
the whole.</p>
<p>Least satisfactory in simulated decentralization are economy,
communications, and decision authority. These weaknesses are inherent in
the design. Because the unit of simu- lated decentralization is not
truly a business, its results are not truly determined by market</p>
<p>performance. They are, in large measure, the results of internal
management decisions. They are decisions on “transfer prices” and “cost
allocations.”</p>
<p>What should a market component of a chemical company pay for the
products it “buys” from a manufacturing component inside the company
which is also considered a business and expected to make a profit on its
own investment? There is no “market price.” There is, therefore, no
objective basis, such as the prices the accessory divisions of Gen- eral
Motors obtain for their product outside of GM. The only possible basis
is cost. And the only way to show a profit is to impose an arbitrary
charge on top of the manufacturing unit’s cost. The marketing unit,
however, could not obtain the products it sells on the out- side—either
because they are not obtainable at all except from competitors, because
the volume needed is too great to depend on outside suppliers, or
because quality is crucial (as in the “intermediates” for pharmaceutical
products). At the very best, the profit and loss of both, the
manufacturing and the marketing, are approximations of genuine
results.</p>
<p>Communications therefore are likely to carry more ’noise” than
message. A tremen- dous amount of managerial time and energy is spent on
working out the demarcation lines between different units which
supposedly are autonomous; on making sure that they co- operate; on
adjudicating disputes between them; or on settling priorities between
two marketing divisions within the same company, both of which want the
same scarce prod- uct from the same autonomous manufacturing unit, and
on the shortest possible time. The smallest adjustment becomes a
top-management decision, a trial of strength, and a matter of honor and
sacred principle.</p>
<p>Simulated decentralization makes high human demands: on
self-discipline, on mutual toleration, on subordinating one’s own
interest, including the interest in one’s own com- pensation, to
arbitration by higher authority; demands to be a “good sport” and a
“cheer- ful loser”; demands that are far more difficult and, above all,
far more divisive than the high demands which federal decentralization
makes on people.</p>
<p>I once heard a candidate for a very senior position in a big bank
turned down because his unit was doing too well at the bank’s expense.
“He puts the performance of his own unit before everything else.” The
next man was turned down because “he is too willing to subordinate the
performance of his unit to the needs and requirements of other units
and, therefore, does not show a good enough performance.” Everyone
admitted to confusion when I asked, “Are there any guidelines for
behavior? Is there any way in which you can tell a man ahead of time
what you consider ‘excessive concern’ for performance and what you
consider ‘excessive cooperation’?” Everyone also admitted that this was
the greatest worry of his own subordinates. “You have to play it by
ear,” the ranking officer finally concluded. But then he stopped himself
and added, “But by whose ear?”</p>
<p>In its scope, simulated decentralization is limited to operating
work. It clearly has no applicability to top-management work. And if
innovative work cannot be set up as a fed- eral decentralized unit, it
requires either functional or team structure.</p>
<p>Rules for Using Simulated Decentralization</p>
<p>The main rule is to look upon simulated decentralization as a last
resort only. As long as a functional structure—with or without the
complement of teams—works, that is, as long as a business is small or
fair-sized, simulated decentralization is to be shunned. And be- yond
such size, federal decentralization is vastly preferable.</p>
<p>Even in the materials company; federal decentralization might be
tried first. One ex- ample of an adaptation of genuine federal
decentralization to a materials business is Owens-Illinois in Toledo,
Ohio, a very large manufacturer of glass bottles. After World War II,
when plastic bottles came in wide use, Owens-Illinois had to go into
plastics to retain its leadership position in the bottle market. The
company decided, after long soul- searching, to set up both the
glass-bottle business and the plastic-bottle business as sepa- rate
autonomous “product” businesses, competing with each other for the same
customers and in the same markets.</p>
<p>The Owens-Illinois strategy was a brilliant success; the company’s
growth has been very rapid. And yet, fifteen years later, in the early
seventies, Owens-Illinois changed over to simulated decentralization. It
retained the two divisions but confined them to manufacturing. Marketing
of all bottles, glass and plastic, was put into a new marketing
division. The reason given was that the customers demanded one source of
supply for all their bottles. “Glass” and “plastics” were not meaningful
terms for them; they buy bottles and not materials.</p>
<p>With all its limitations, weaknesses, and risks, simulated
decentralization may there- fore be the best available principle where
constituent parts of the same large business have to work together and
yet have to have individual responsibility. This applies espe- cially
where the logic of market is incompatible with that of technology and
production.</p>
<p>Indeed, we may have to learn how to extend its scope. It is the most
promising ap- proach to the organization of large and complex
“monolithic” businesses (and non- business service institutions). The
leading examples here are the large transportation companies, especially
railroads and airlines, but also the typical government agency.</p>
<p>A railroad or an airline has by definition no purely “local”
business. Hence, businesses like this have so far no choice but to
organize themselves according to functions with, at best, a regional
coordinator who intervenes between the functions, mediates, and insures
liaison. The decisions which affect performance of a transportation
system can only be taken centrally. They are, above all, decisions on
capital utilization, on the assignment of airplanes, locomotives, and
freight cars, for instance. Yet transportation businesses, while
incapable of being decentralized except for relatively unimportant
tasks, are also clearly far too large to work well under functional
organization.</p>
<p>In simulated decentralization we at least know what to expect. It is
therefore a major task of organization theory and organization practice
to develop for these large and over- centralized functional structures,
such as a railroad system or most government agencies, an organization
design that works no worse for them than simulated decentralization
works, for instance, for the large materials companies and the large
commercial banks. This will probably have to be some application of the
principle of simulated decentraliza- tion.</p>
