<p>Decision Analysis—Where Does Certain Work Belong? —Relations
Analysis—Where Does a Particular Unit Belong? —Keeping Relationships to
a Minimum—But Making Each Count—Malorganization, Its Symptoms and Its
Causes—Too Many Levels— Recurrent Organization
Problems—Meetings—Overconcern with “Feelings”— Reliance on Nonjobs—
“Organizitis” as a Chronic Affliction</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>DENTIFYING KEY ACTIVITIES and analyzing their contributions defines
the build- ing blocks of organization. But to place the structural units
which make up the organi- zation requires two additional pieces of work:
an analysis of decisions and an analysis of relations.</p>
<p>Decision Analysis</p>
<p>What decisions are needed to obtain the performance necessary to
attain objectives? What kinds of decisions are they? On what level of
the organization should they be made? What activities are involved in,
or affected by them? Which managers must therefore participate in the
decisions—at least to the extent of being consulted beforehand? Which
managers must be informed after they have been made? The answers to
these questions very largely determine where certain work belongs.</p>
<p>It will be argued that it is impossible to anticipate what kinds of
decisions will arise in the future. But while their content cannot be
predicted their kind and subject matter have a high degree of
predictability.</p>
<p>In one large company well over 90 percent of the decisions that
managers had to make over a five-year period were found to be “typical,”
and fell within a small number of cate- gories. In only a few cases
would it have been necessary to ask, “Where does this decision belong?”
had the problem been thought through in advance. Yet, because there was
no decision analysis, almost three-quarters of the decisions had to “go
looking for a home,” as the graphic phrase within the company put it,
and most of them went to a much higher level of management than was
needed. The company’s components had been placed ac- cording to the size
of their payroll rather than according to their decision responsibility
so that the activities that should have made key decisions were placed
so low as to be with- out authority and also without adequate
information.</p>
<p>To place authority and responsibility for various kinds of decisions
requires first that they be classified according to kind and character.
Such standard classifications as “policy decisions” and “operating
decisions” are practically meaningless, however, and give rise to
endless debates of a highly abstruse nature. Not much more helpful is
classification according to the amount of money involved.</p>
<p>There are four basic characteristics which determine the nature of
any business deci- sion.</p>
<p>First, there is the degree of futurity in the decision. For how long
into the future does it commit the company? And how fast can it be
reversed?</p>
<p>The buyer at Sears, Roebuck has practically no limit as to the amount
to which he can commit the company. But no buyer or buying supervisor
can either abandon an existing product or add a new one without the
approval of the head of the entire buying operation who, traditionally,
is the number two or number three man in the entire Sears, Roebuck
organization. Similarly, the foreign exchange trader in a major
commercial bank tradi- tionally has only the loosest limit on the
amounts to which he can commit the bank. But he cannot start trading in
a new currency without approval from high authority in the bank. And he
cannot carry a “position” regardless of amount, beyond a fixed and short
period of time.</p>
<p>The second criterion is the impact a decision has on other functions,
on other areas, or on the business as a whole. If it affects only one
function, it is of the lowest order. Other- wise it will have to be made
on a higher level, where the impact on all affected functions can be
considered; or it must be made in close consultation with the managers
of the other affected functions. To use technical language,
“Optimization” of process and performance of one function or area must
not be at the expense of other functions or areas; this is un- desirable
“sub-optimization.”</p>
<p>One example of a decision which looks like a purely “technical” one
affecting one area only, but which actually has impact on many areas, is
a change in the methods of keeping the parts inventory in a
mass-production plant. This affects all manufacturing operations. It
makes necessary major changes in assembly. It affects delivery to
custom- ers—it might even lead to radical changes in marketing and
pricing, such as the aban- donment of certain designs and models and of
certain premium prices. And it may require substantial changes in
engineering design. The technical problems in inventory-keeping— though
quite considerable—pale into insignificance compared to the problems in
other areas which any change in inventory-keeping will produce. To
“optimize” inventory- keeping at the expense of these other areas cannot
be allowed. It can be avoided only if the decision is recognized as
belonging to a fairly high order and handled as one affecting the entire
process: either it has to be reserved for management higher than the
plant; or it requires close consultation among all functional
managers.</p>
<p>The consideration of the impact of a decision and the need to prevent
“sub- optimization” may shift the focus of a decision decisively, as the
following example shows.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Du Pont Company, when it was still solely an
explosives manufacturer, the company was by far the world’s largest
buyer of nitrate, without, how- ever, owning any nitrate fields. Yet the
purchasing department was given a completely free hand in buying
nitrate. It did so, indeed, most successfully—from the point of view of
purchasing. It bought nitrate when the market prices were low and
succeeded in obtaining the vital raw material for the company at prices
far below what the competitors usually had to pay. Yet this was
sub-optimization. For the low prices for nitrate and the resulting
competitive cost advantage were paid for by tying up large sums of money
in inventory. This, in the first place, meant that a good deal of the
cost advantage of low nitrate prices was illusory and offset by high
interest payments. More serious, it also meant that the company, in the
event of a downturn in business, might find itself in a liquidity
crisis. The decision to balance cheap raw material prices against the
cost of money and the danger of illiquidity was therefore properly made
as a top-management decision. But after the new limits for inventory had
been established, the buying decisions again became exclusively the task
of the purchasing people.</p>
<p>The character of a decision is also determined by the number of
qualitative factors that enter into it: basic principles of conduct,
ethical values, social and political beliefs, etc. The moment value
considerations have to be taken into account, the decision moves into a
higher order and requires either determination or review at a higher
level. And the most important , as well as the most common of
qualitative factors are human beings. (This, of course, underlies the
strong recommendation in Chapter 36 for top-management</p>
<p>people to play an active part in the decisions on promotion to upper
levels of middle man- agement.)</p>
<p>Finally, decisions can be classified according to whether they are
periodically recur- rent or rare, if not unique, decisions. The
recurrent decision requires the establishment of a general rule, that
is, of a decision in principle. Since suspending an employee deals with
a person, the rule has to be decided at a fairly high level in the
organization. But the ap- plication of the rule to the specific case,
while also a decision, can then be placed on a much lower level.</p>
<p>The rare decision, however, has to be treated as a distinct event.
Whenever it occurs, it has to be thought through.</p>
<p>A decision should always be made at the lowest possible level and as
close to the scene of action as possible. However, a decision should
always be made at a level insur- ing that all activities and objectives
affected are fully considered. The first rule tells us how far down a
decision should be made. The second how far down it can be made, as well
as which managers must share in the decision and which must be informed
of it. The two together tell us where certain activities should be
placed. Managers should be high enough to have the authority needed to
make the typical decisions pertaining to their work; and low enough to
have the detailed knowledge and the first-hand experience, “where the
action is.”</p>
<p>Relations Analysis</p>
<p>The final step in designing the building blocks of organizations is
an analysis of relations. It tells us where a specific component
belongs.</p>
<p>With whom will a manager in charge of an activity have to work, what
contribution does he have to make to managers in charge of other
activities, and what contribution do these managers, in turn, have to
make to him?</p>
<p>The basic rule in placing an activity within the organization
structure is to impose on it the smallest possible number of
relationships. At the same time, it should be so placed that the crucial
relations, that is, the relationship on which depend its success and the
ef- fectiveness of its contribution, should be easy, accessible, and
central to the unit. The rule is to keep relationships to a minimum but
make each count.</p>
<p>This rule explains why functions are not, as traditional organization
theory would have them be, “bundles of related skills.” If we followed
that logic, we would, for instance, put production planning into a
planning component in which all kinds of planners would work together.
The skills needed in production planning are closely related to all
other opera- tional planning skills. Instead we put the production
planner into manufacturing and as close as possible both to the plant
manager and to the first-line supervisors. This is where he belongs
according to his relationship.</p>
<p>There is often a conflict between placement according to decision
analysis and place- ment according to relations analysis. By and large,
one should try to follow the logic of relations as far as he can.</p>
<p>If organization design has to follow the logic of decisions in order
to avoid sub- optimization (as is usually the case with respect to the
accounting function) the work itself should be planned according to
relations analysis, that is, as close as possible to the scene of
action. The direction of the work, the setting of rules, of standards,
but also the ap- praisal and evaluation of the work should be placed
according to decision analysis in a central component which can see the
entire business and think through the impacts.</p>
<p>The four analyses—on key activities, of contributions, of decisions,
of relations— should always be kept as simple and as brief as possible.
In a small enterprise they can often be done in a matter of hours and on
a few pieces of paper. In a very large and com- plex enterprise, though,
such as General Electric, the First National City Bank, or Unile- ver
(not to mention the Department of Defense) the job may well require
months of study and the application of highly advanced tools of analysis
and synthesis. But these analyses</p>
<p>should never be slighted or skimped. They should be considered a
necessary task and one that has to be done well in every business.</p>
<p>Symptoms of Malorganization</p>
<p>There is no perfect organization. At its best an organization
structure will not cause trou- ble. But what are the most common
mistakes in designing the building blocks of organiza- tion and joining
them together? And what are the most common symptoms of serious flaws in
organization?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The most common and the most serious symptom of malorganization is
multiplica- tion of the number of management levels. A basic rule of
organization is to build the least possible number of management levels
and forge the shortest possible chain of command.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every additional level makes more difficult the attainment of common
direction and mutual understanding. Every additional level distorts
objectives and misdirects attention. Mathematical “information theory”
has a law that any additional relay in a communica- tions system halves
the “message” and doubles the “noise.” Any “level” in an organiza- tion
is a “relay.” Every link in the chain sets up additional stresses and
creates one more source of inertia, friction, and slack.</p>
<p>Every additional level, especially in the big business, adds to the
difficulty of develop- ing tomorrow’s managers, both by adding to the
time it takes to come up from the bottom and by making specialists
rather than managers out of the men moving up through the chain.</p>
<p>In some large companies there are today twelve or even fifteen levels
between first- line supervisor and company president. Assuming that a
man gets appointed first-line su- pervisor at age twenty-five, and that
he spends only five years on each intervening level— both optimistic
assumptions—he would be eighty or ninety before he could even be con-
sidered for the company’s presidency. And the usual “cure”—a special
promotion ladder for hand-picked young “geniuses” or “crown princes”—is
as bad as the disease.</p>
<p>How few levels are really needed is shown by the example of the
oldest, largest, and most successful organization of the West, the
Catholic Church. There is only one level of authority and responsibility
between the Pope and the lowliest parish priest: the bishop.</p>
<p>The second most common symptom of malorganization is recurrence of
organiza- tional problems. No sooner has a problem supposedly been
“solved” than it comes back again in a new guise.</p>
<p>A typical example in a manufacturing company is product development.
The market- ing people think it belongs to them, the research and
development people are equally con- vinced that it belongs to them. But
placing it in either component simply creates a recur- ring problem.
Actually both placements are wrong. In a business that wants innovation,
product development is a key activity and a revenue-producing activity.
It should not be subordinated to any other activity. It deserves to be
organized as a separate innovative component.*</p>
<p>The recurrent organization problem indicates unthinking application
of traditional “organization principles” such as that of the “typical
function” or that of “staff and line.” The answer lies in making the
right analyses—the key-activities analysis, the contribu- tions
analysis, the decisions analysis, and the relations analysis. An
organization problem that comes back more than a couple of times should
not be treated mechanically by shuf- fling little boxes on a piece of
paper. It indicates lack of thinking, lack of clarity, and lack of
understanding.</p>
<p>Equally common and equally dangerous is an organization structure
that puts the at- tention of key people on the wrong, the irrelevant,
the secondary problems. Organization should put the attention of people
on major business decisions, on key activities, and on performance and
results. If, instead, it puts attention on proper behavior, on
etiquette, on</p>
<p>*On this see Chapter 61, “The Innovative Organization.”</p>
<p>procedure, let alone on jurisdictional conflict, organization
misdirects. Then organization becomes a bar to performance.</p>
<p>Again, this is the result of mechanical rather than organic
organization building. It is the result of slapping on so-called
principles, instead of thinking through what organiza- tion the strategy
of the business demands. It is the result of focusing organization on
symmetry rather than on performance.</p>
<p>No organization chart is likely ever to be displayed in a major art
museum. What mat- ters is not the chart but the organization. A chart is
nothing but an oversimplification which enables people to make sure that
they talk about the same things in discussing or- ganization structure.
One never makes organizational changes for the sake of the chart. This
always results in malorganization.</p>
<p>There are a number of common symptoms of poor organization which,
usually, re- quire no further diagnosis. There is, first, the symptom of
too many meetings attended by too many people.</p>
<p>There are, especially in large organizations, managerial organs which
do their work in and by meetings. The top committees in General Motors
are examples. And so are the boards of directors composed of the top
officers which govern both Standard Oil of New Jersey and Du Pont. But
these are exceptions—deliberative organs which do not have operating
functions and, as a rule, do not have decision-making functions either.
They are organs to guide, to reflect, to review—and perhaps their most
important function is to compel the operating top managers who sit down
with the committee to think through their own direction, their own
needs, and their own opportunities.</p>
<p>But apart from such deliberative bodies, which discharge their
functions in meetings, meetings should be considered as a concession to
organizational imperfection. The ideal is the organization which can
operate without meetings—in the same sense in which the ideal of the
machine designer is to have only one moving part in his contraption. In
every human organization there is far too much need for cooperation,
coordination, and human relations to have to provide for additional
meetings. And the human dynamics of meetings are so complex as to make
them very poor tools for getting any work done.</p>
<p>Whenever executives, except at the very top level, spend more than a
fairly small frac- tion of their time—maybe a quarter or less—in
meetings, there is prima facie a case of malorganization. An excess of
meetings indicates that jobs have not been defined clearly, have not
been structured big enough, have not been made truly responsible. Also
the need for meetings indicates that the decisions and relations
analyses either have not been made at all or have not been applied. The
rule should be to minimize the need for people to get together to
accomplish anything.</p>
<p>An organization in which people are all the time concerned about
feelings and about what other people will like or will not like is not
an organization that has good human relations. On the contrary, it is an
organization that has very poor human relations. Good human relations,
like good manners, are taken for granted. Constant anxiety over other
people’s feelings is the worst kind of human relations.</p>
<p>An organization that suffers from this—and a great many do—can be
said unequivo- cally to suffer from overstaffing. It might be
overstaffed in terms of activities. Instead of focusing on key
activities, it tries to do a little bit of everything—especially in
advice and teaching activities. Or the individual activities are
overstaffed. It is in crowded rooms that people get on each other’s
nerves, poke their elbows into each other’s eyes, and step on each
other’s toes. Where there is enough distance they do not collide.
Overstaffed organi- zations create work rather than performance. They
also create friction, sensitivity, irrita- tion, and concern with
feelings.</p>
<p>It is a symptom of malorganization to rely on “coordinators,”
“assistants,” and other such whose job it is not to have a job. This
indicates that activities and jobs have been designed too narrowly, or
that activities and jobs, rather than being designed for one de- fined
result, are expected to do a great many parts of different tasks. It
usually indicates also that organizational components have been
organized according to skill rather than according to their place in the
process or according to their contribution. For skill always</p>
<p>contributes only a part rather than a result. And then one need a
coordinator or some other such non-job to put pieces together that
should never have been separated in the first place.</p>
<p>“Organizitis” as a Chronic Affliction</p>
<p>Some, indeed a good many, businesses, especially large and complex
ones suffer from the disease of “organizitis.” Everybody is concerned
with organization. Reorganization is going on all the time. At the first
sign of any trouble, be it only a spat over a specification between a
purchasing agent and the people in engineering, the cry goes up for the
“or- ganization doctors,” whether outside consultants or inside staff.
And no organizational solution ever lasts long, indeed few
organizational arrangements are even given enough time to be tested and
worked out in practice, before another organization study is put in
train.</p>
<p>In some cases this does indeed suggest malorganization. “Organizitis”
will set in if or- ganization structure fails to come to grips with
fundamentals. It is, especially, the result of not rethinking and
restructuring the organization when there is a fundamental change in the
size and complexity of a business or in its objectives and strategy.</p>
<p>But just as often “organizitis” is self-inflicted and a form of
hypochondria. It therefore should be emphasized that organizational
change should not be undertaken often and should not be undertaken
lightly. Reorganization is a form of surgery; and even minor surgery has
risks.</p>
<p>The demands for organization studies or for reorganization as a
response to minor ailments should be resisted. No organization will ever
be perfect. A certain amount of friction, of incongruity, of
organizational confusion is inevitable.</p>
<p>The last two chapters have dealt with the “engineering” aspects of
organization: the building blocks, their placement, and their
relationships. But organization also needs “ar- chitecture”; it needs
structural logic and structural principles. It also calls for
understand- ing of the requirements organization structure needs to
satisfy, i.e., of “design specifica- tions.”</p>
