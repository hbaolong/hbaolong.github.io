<li><p>But even Barnard’s colleagues at the Telephone Company showed no
interest in what they considered his hobby. Few managers at that time
would have even realized that they practiced management; and concern
with man- agement as a field of study, as a discipline, and as a social
function was practically non- existent.</p></li>
<li><p>On these men and others, see “Note: The Roots and History of
Management,” p. 21.</p></li>
<li><p>Before World War II only Harvard taught management; by the late
sixties the number of business schools teaching management all over the
world probably numbered well in the hundreds. Advanced management educa-
tion was almost totally unknown before World War II. Nobody in the 1970s
can count the number of advanced management courses, advanced management
seminars, special schools, special institutes, staff colleges, and other
institutions concerned with the profes- sional formation and advanced
training of managers all over the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Management books have achieved the impossible: they have become
best sellers—e.g., Alfred P. Sloan, Jr.’s My Years with General Motors
(Doubleday, l964). Even satires on management have become best sellers,
such as Robert Townsend’s Up the Organization (Knopf, 1970). These books
have been read by the general public even though they are replete with
recondite and obscure management terms and management cliches which a
few years ago only a handful of initiates would have
understood.</p></li>
<li><p>For a further discussion of this, see the prologue and the
epilogue to the 1972 reissue of my study of General Motors, Concept of
the Corporation, originally published in 1946.</p></li>
<li><p>The management boom owes a great deal of its force to the fact
that man- agement is not value-free.</p></li>
<li><p>A non-Western scholar, the Japanese Chie Nakane, has seen this
much more clearly than any Westerner— precisely because the Japanese
tradition is not a Western tradition, whereas management is distinctly a
Western concept. See her book, Japanese Society (University of
California Press,1970).</p></li>

<ol start="32" type="1">
<li><p>What the “Regulatory Commission” is may need a word of
explanation even for American readers: outside the U.S. the institution
is largely unknown. First devised in the 1880s to regulate railroads and
grain terminals, the function of the regutatory agency is to make
private enterprise function in the public interest under conditions of
“natural” monopoly where competition cannot efiectively do the job.
These agencies, by and large, have three functions: to maintain as far
as feasible competition in a service area; to protect the public against
exploitation by “natural” monopolies through control of prices and
service standards; and to limit the earnings of “natural” monopolies,
whether railroads, airlines, power companies, or broadcasters, to a
“fair return” geared to the cost of capital. The “regulatory agency”
thus presents an attempt to find a “third way” between the uncontrolled
private monopoly and—equally uncontrolled—government monopoly.
Regulatory commissions exist both at the federal level and in the
various states; the commissioners are either government-appointed (as on
all federal commissions) or elected, as in many states.</p></li>
<li><p>A striking parallel is the impact of World War II on American
economists. Most of the economists who joined the World War II
economic-control agencies were inclined toward planning and controls
when they went in. Their formative experiences and background were,
after all, the Depression years. But most came out of the World War II
agencies as confirmed enemies of controls and believers in the market,
at least as the lesser evil. †This blueprint, by the way, bears a
striking resemblance both to what Adenauer’s Germany after World War II
adopted as “social market economy” and to the way today’s Japan actually
runs its “free economy.”</p></li>
<li><p>On this see Ota Sik, Czechoslovakia: The Bureaucratic Economy
(International Arts and Sciences Press, 1972); Sik was the economic
architect of the Czech reforms until ousted by the Russians.</p></li>

Service Institutions for Performance</h4>
<ol start="35" type="1">
<li><p>Also, there should be a fair amount of consumer choice between
different ways of accomplishing the basic mission, between different
priorities and different methods. There should be enough competition for
these institutions to hold themselves to performance standards.</p></li>
<li><p>In an earlier book, The Age of Discontinuity, I called this
“re-privatization” for want of a better term. This, however, has been
widely misunderstood as meaning return to private ownership, which is
not at all what I had in mind (though I would not exclude it either).
What is important is the autonomy of the institution, its subjection to
performance tests and to some form of competition, albeit in many cases
“socialist competition.”</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="the-new-realities">15 The New Realities</h4>
<ol start="37" type="1">
<li><p>On this see my book, The New Society (New York and London,
1950).</p></li>
<li><p>Now knowledge work is carried out in large, complex, managed
institutions. The knowledge worker is not even the successor to
yesterday’s “knowledge professional.” He is the successor to yesterday’s
skilled worker. His status, his function, his contribution, his position
in the organization, therefore, still have to be defined.</p></li>
<li><p>On this see my book, The Age of Discontinuity.</p></li>
<li><p>This is far too glib and superficial an explanation. To be sure,
affluence is something new under the sun. Throughout all of man’s
history the great majority of people has always lived at the margin of
subsistence. The great majority never knew where its next meal was going
to come from. Now, in the developed countries, the great majority is
economically secure, at least in traditional terms. But there is no sign
that the great majority—or any but the tiniest of minorities—has lost
its appetite for economic rewards, whether material or immaterial. On
the contrary, the great majority, now that they have tasted some of the
fruits of productivity, are clearly eager for more—much more than the
economy can produce so far, if not more than the limited resources of
our planet could produce.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not seem to have occurred to Western sociologists that
the strongest practitioners of the Protestant ethic have for long
periods of time been such notorious non-Calvinists as the Japanese and
the Chinese.</p></li>

economic deprivation, but primarily because it undermines self-respect.
Work is an extension of personality. It is achievement. It is one of the
ways in which a person defines himself or herself, measures his worth,

order is being satisfied, it becomes less and less important, with a
want of the next-highest order becoming more and more important. Maslow
applied to human wants what might be called “marginal utility”—and his
was a profound and lasting insight. Maslow put economic want at the
bottom and the need for self-fulfillment at the top. But the order is
not of first importance. What matters is the insight that wants are not
absolute; the more one want is being satisfied, the less its
satisfaction matters.</p></li>

<li><p>To belittle Taylor because in 1880 he did not know post-Freudian
psychology is, as I said at another occasion (when I received in 1967
the Taylor Key of the Association for Advancement of Management),
somewhat like belittling Isaac Newton for not knowing quantum mechanics
or non-Euclidian geometry in 1690.</p></li>
<li><p>An important exception was one of Taylor’s disciples, Allen
Mogensen, who, in the 1920s, pioneered what he called “work
simplification”—startlingly similar to what is now being rediscovered as
job enrichment,” if not way ahead of it.</p></li>

research. He acknowledged freely in his book that he had devel- oped no
new ideas but had formulated the ideas of others (and especially those I
had put forth in three earlier books†). But his book fully deserves the
wide attention it has re- ceived. McGregor powerfully presented
fundamental choices for managing worker and working. His Theory X—the
traditional approach to worker and working—assumes that people are lazy,
dislike and shun work, have to be driven and need both carrot and stick.
It assumes that most people are incapable of taking responsibility for
themselves and have to be looked after. By contrast, Theory Y assumes
that people have a psychological need to work and want achievement and
responsibility. Theory X assumes immaturity. Theory Y assumes
fundamentally that people want to be adults.</p></li>

<li><p>McClelland has taken the position that the desire to achieve is
conditioned largely by cul- ture and by experiences, both of which can
be changed even in a non-achieving culture such as that of the Indian
caste system. The most extensive study of actual worker behav- ior in
large-scale industry, the work which the Canadian-born English
psychiatrist Elliott Jaques† conducted for many years at the Glacier
Metal Company in London (together with the company’s chief executive,
Wilfred Brown), supports the same conclusion.</p></li>

<li><p>The hidden cost of the middle- aged knowledge workers—managers
and knowledge professionals—who have “retired on the job,” have lost
interest, and just go through the motions, may well be larger than that
of Ford’s labor turnover in 1913. At the same time, the frustrations and
silent despair of these men and women may pose as great a social danger
to society as the misery, bitter- ness, and despair of the suffering
manual worker of yesterday. Nothing is as corrosive as success turned
into frustration. The first company which tackles this problem as both a
social problem and an opportunity might well reap benefits fully as
great as those reaped by Ford sixty years ago and Olivetti and IBM forty
years ago.</p></li>

<li><p>Every vice-president feels that relations with the president are
the real problem. And so on down to the first-line supervisor, the
production foreman, or chief clerk, who is quite certain that he could
get along with his men if only the “boss” and the personnel department
left him alone.</p></li>
<li><p>This will be treated further in Chapter 38, “Managerial
Communications.”</p></li>
<li><p>Henry Ford stuck uncom- promisingly to his convictions. The way
he applied them—e.g., by firing or sidelining any one of his “helpers,”
no matter how able, who dared act as a “manager,” make a decision, or
take action without orders from Ford—can only be described as a test of
a hypothesis that ended up by fully disproving it.</p></li>
<li><p>On Henry Ford, see my essay “Henry Ford” in my book, Men, Ideas
and Politics (Harper andandandand Row, 1971); English edition is called
The New Markets (Heinemenn, 1971).</p></li>
<li><p>—Iwasaki insisted on the sole authority and responsibility of the
owner-entrepreneur. This, to him, was “progressive” and “Western.” Like
Ford he was forced to incorporate his company. Like Ford he con- sidered
this a mere formality—an irksome one, to boot—and decreed that all
ownership should forever be vested in one man: the head of the family.
This man, and this man alone, should make all the decisions; the others
should be his “assistants” and carry out his orders. Iwasaki started in
1867—right after the Meiji Restoration—as a penniless samurai
(hereditary warrior). Fifteen years later his concern was the leading
industry in Japan, having outstripped the much older business powers,
Mitsui and Sumitomo, whose roots went back to the seventeenth century.
But by that time—comparable to Ford’s situa- tion in 1920—Mitsubishi
began to slow down, to drift, and to show clear signs of incipi- ent
decay. Fortunately for the company, Iwasaki died, barely fifty years
old, in 1885. His trusted associates, though sworn to uphold the
constitution he had laid down and to vest full authority in the head of
thc family, immediately restructured and built the strongest, most truly
professional and most autonomous management group in Japan, from which
the family, while treated with the greatest deference, was completely
excluded. And it was then that the rise and growth of Mitsubishi truly
began.</p></li>

industry and has remained the leader ever since.</p></li>
<li><p>On Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., see my book Managing for Results and
Sloan’s own book, My Years with General Motors (Doubleday,
1964).</p></li>
<li><p>And in faraway Japan, the builders of the Zaibatsu of the Meiji
Period—Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Iwasaki’s successors at Mitsubishi—using
traditional Japanese approaches in a new man- ner, also fashioned a
management system for the large and complex enterprise.</p></li>

<li><p>—the world leader in 1870, the “also ran” twenty years later—with
Chandler’s account of the Du Ponts. As late as 1926, when Imperial
Chemical Industries (ICI) was formed by merging all large British
chemical companies into one, the first “board” was both the top
management organ and a mélange of wealthy amateurs representing former
founder-families—without clear structure within the board or below it.
The German I.G. Farben was formed in a similar fashion a few months
earlier. But from the beginning the Germans took financial, family, and
prestige problems out of the management structure and dumped them on a
non-managing board of supervisors. A few members of the found- ing
families were taken on the board of management. But they served as
professional managers, that is, had a specific job, function, and
authority, and were equals on a team dominated by professionals without
family or ownership background.</p></li>

<li><p>However, they are clearly not managers in that they are not, as a
rule, the bosses and responsible for the work of other people. The most
rapidly growing group in business enterprise today are individual
professional contribu- tors of all kinds who work by themselves (perhaps
with an assistant and a secretary) and yet have impact on the company’s
wealth-producing capacity, the direction of its busi- ness, and its
performance.</p></li>
<li><p>On this see especially Chapter 35.</p></li>
<li><p>with “parallel paths of opportunity” for both. This made it
possible to pay a man properly for “professional” work rather than make
higher pay dependent upon promotion into a “manager’s” job, that is,
into a position of responsibility for the work of others.</p></li>
<li><p>The pioneer in this effort was the General Electric Company
especially its former vice-president— management services, Harold F.
Smiddy, who realized the central importance of this problem and made the
first attempts at solving it.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps the best thing is not to coin a new term, but to follow
popular usage which speaks of the “management group.” Within the
management group, there will be people whose function includes the
traditional managerial function, responsibility for the work of others.
There will be others who do not carry this responsibility within their
specific assignment. And there will be a third group which is somewhat
ambiguous and in-between, people whose job is that of team leader or
task force captain, or people who combine both the function of advisor
to top management and the “conscience” of a business in a certain area,
with supervisory and administrative responsibility over a staff in a
given area. This is not a neat, let alone a perfect, solution. In every
organization there are people who are true specialists and who, while
anything but rank-and-file workers, do not see themselves as past of
management either. They want to remain specialists and are not,
fundamentally, much concerned with the whole of which they are a part.
Their allegiance is to their technical or professional skill, rather
than to their organization. The psychologist within a personnel
department sees himself as a professional—that is, a member of the world
of his academic specialty— rather than as an executive of this or that
company (or even as a faculty member of this or that university). And so
does the computer specialist.</p></li>
<li><p>In my book, The Effective Executive, I proposed to call these
people “executives,” the term to embrace both the traditional “managers”
and the nonmanaging professional with responsibility for determining the
objectives of contribution and result of their work, who are expected to
make decisions that affect the performance and wealth-producing
potential of the entire business.</p></li>

prospects at home and little standing in English society. Their pay was
low; and such opportunities for loot or gain as their predecessors had
enjoyed in the swashbuckling days of the East India Company a hundred
years earlier had, by 1860, been completely eliminated by both law and
custom.</p></li>
<li><p>Leonard Woolf, who served as a young district commissioner in
Ceylon in the early years of this century, has given the best
picture—both of the isolation and of the challenges of the life—in one
volume of his autobiogra- phy, Growing (Harcount, Brace, 1962).</p></li>
<li><p>The most perceptive book I know on the British in India, Philip
Woodruff’s The Men Who Ruled India (two volumes, St. Martin’s Press,

belief in the “philosopher king,” that is, ther belief that
administration could suffice and could take the place of policy,
decision, and direction.</p></li>
<li><p>I would exempt from the rule “honorifics” that primarily bespeak
seniority such as “junior” and “senior,” especially for individual
career professionals but would then strongly insist that such titles be
used only to denote seniority—more or less in the fashion in which the
title monsignor in the Catholic Church (at least in the U.S.) is almost
automatically bestowed on any man who has served twenty-five years in
the priesthood and stayed out of trouble.</p></li>
<li><p>But he made one exception fo accommodate one of the great
inventors of our century, Charles F. Kettering. Kettering was an
exceedingly diffi- cult man, and also a man who disregarded every single
organizational rule. Yet his inven- tions, from the self-starter to the
redesign of the diesel engine, were of major importance. Sloan offered
to set up Kettering as an independent researcher. But Kettering wanted
to be vice-president and a “big businessman.” Sloan gave in, but the
moment Kettering re- tired, the job was redesigned—from “resident
genius” to manager of a large research laboratory.</p></li>

Sovereignty at Bay by Raymond Vernon, (Basic Books, 1971): this may be
exaggeration—but sovereignty is being challenged.</p></li>
<li><p>Such law will not only have to define under what conditions
countries accept multi- nationals and what limitations they may impose
on ownership, on remittance of profits and repayments of capital, and on
freedom of movement of goods, people, and capital from one subsidiary of
a multinational to another.</p></li>

N. Behrman, former Assistant Secretary of Commerce of the U.S. under
President Kennedy, and now Professor of Intemational Economics at the

<li>Even the Du Pont management did not consider its company to be a
growth company at that time. The deci- sion to invest a large part of
the profits the company had made during World War I in General
Motors—which then, a few years later, led to GM’s reorganization and
subsequent rise—was made because the Du Pont top management (and
especially Pierre du Pont, the company’s chief executive) did not see
much growth opportu- nity for their company in their own industry.</li>

<li><p>shows both the strength of the truly accomplished technocratic
manager and his limita- tions. General Motors has stayed with Sloan’s
legacy. And in Sloan’s terms i.e., in terms of sales and profits, it has
succeeded admirably, at least in the North American market. But it has
also failed abysmally—in terms of public reputation, of public esteem,
of ac- ceptance by the public.†</p></li>
