What We Know (and Don’t Know) About Work, Working, and Worker</h4>
<p>The Primitive State of Our Knowledge—The Three Requirements of
Productive Work—Taylor’s Analysis, Its Contribution, and Its
Limitations—Synthesis and Control of Work—The Five Dimensions of
Working: Physiology, Psychology; Community; Economics; Power—Machine
Design and “Human Design” —Work as Curse and Blessing—Work as Social and
Community Bond— “Wage Fund” and “Capital Fund” —Work as Living and Work
as Cost—The Mirage of Worker Ownership—The Power Dimension of
Working—Organization Is Alienation—The Sixth Dimension: Power in the
Economic Sphere—Organization as a Redistributive System—The Fallacy of
the Dominant Dimension—Wants as Hierarchy and as Configuration—Wants
Change in the Process of Being Satisfied—What Can the Manager Do?</p>
<p>WORK HAS BEEN CENTRAL to man’s consciousness for untold ages. Man is
not truly defined as the toolmaker, but making tools, the systematic,
purposeful, and organized approach to work, is specific and unique human
activity. Work has, therefore, been a profound concern for
millennia.</p>
<p>Concern with work stands at the very beginning of what we call the
Western tradition.</p>
<p>In the Bible work is both man’s punishment for original sin and God’s
gift to make man’s fallen estate bearable. At the dawn of Greek
civilization, there is Hesiod’s great narrative poem, Work and Days—and
“work” stands before “days” in defining man’s estate and man’s life.
Life, Hesiod said, is “work over time.”</p>
<p>What was always a profound concern became central with the industrial
revolution.</p>
<p>The economic and social theories of the last two hundred years center
on work. This is true not only of Marxism, with its oversimplification
of history according to which society is always organized according to
the way the means of production, that is, the tools for work, are being
controlled; it is equally true of the orthodox economists, of the
philosophical sociologists of early nineteenth-century France, or of
most other “isms” of the last two hundred years.</p>
<p>However central work has been to man all along, organized study of
work did not begin until the closing decades of the nineteenth century.
Frederick W. Taylor was the first man in recorded history who deemed
work deserving of systematic observation and study. On Taylor’s
“scientific management” rests, above all, the tremendous surge of
affluence in the last seventy-five years which has lifted the working
masses in the developed countries well above any level recorded before,
even for the well-to-do. Taylor, though the Isaac Newton (or perhaps the
Archimedes) of the science of work, laid only first foundations,
however. Not much has been added to them since—even though he has been
dead all of sixty years.</p>
<p>The worker has been given even less attention—and the knowledge
worker has received so far almost none. Rhetoric there is aplenty, but
serious, systematic study has been confined to a few aspects of
working.</p>
<p>There is industrial physiology, dealing with the relationship of such
things as lighting, tool and machine speeds, design of the work place,
and so on, to the human being who is the worker; the fundamental work
here was done in the early years of this century, e.g., in the fatigue
and vision studies of the German-born Harvard psychologist Hugo
Muensterberg. Cyril Burt, an Englishman, might be called the father of
industrial psychology. During World War I he studied aptitudes, that is,
the relationship between the demands of specific manual work and the
physical skill; motor coordination, and reactions of individual workers.
Finally, in the early nineteenth century, Australian-born Elton Mayo,
working primarily at Harvard, developed human relations, that is, the
study of the relationship between people working together—though in
human relations work itself, that is, the task to be done, received
almost no attention.</p>
<p>The totality of “worker” and “working,” the totality of task and job,
perception and personality, work community, rewards and power relations,
has received practically no attention. It may be far too complex ever to
be truly understood.</p>
<p>The manager cannot wait till the scientists and scholars have done
their work. Nor can the worker. The manager has to manage today. He has
to put to work the little we know, inadequate though it is. He has to
try to make work productive and the worker achieving. It might,
therefore, be appropriate to put down what we know about work and
working.</p>
<p>The most important thing we know is that work and working are
fundamentally different phenomena. The worker does, indeed, do work; and
work is always done by a worker who is working. But what is needed to
make work productive is quite different from what is needed to make the
worker achieving. The worker must, therefore, be managed according to
both the logic of the work and the dynamics of working. Personal
satisfaction of the worker without productive work is failure; but so is
productive work that destroys the worker’s achievement. Neither is, in
effect, tenable for very long.</p>
<p>Work, as has been said in the preceding chapter, is impersonal and
objective. Work is a task. It is a “something.” To work, therefore,
applies the rule that applies to objects. Work has a logic. It requires
analysis, synthesis, and control.</p>
<p>As with every phenomenon of the objective universe, the first step
toward understanding work is to analyze it. This, as Taylor realized a
century ago, means identifying the basic operations, analyzing each of
them, and arranging them in logical, balanced, and rational
sequence.</p>
<p>Taylor worked, of course, on manual operations. But Taylor’s analysis
applies just as well to mental and even to totally intangible work. The
“outline” which the budding writer is being told to work out, before he
starts to write, is in effect scientific management. And the most
advanced, most perfect example of scientific management was not
developed by industrial engineers during the last hundred years. It is
the alphabet, which enables all words in a language to be written with a
very small number of repetitive and simple symbols.</p>
<p>But then—and Taylor did not realize this—work has to be synthesized
again. It has to be put together into a process. This is true for the
individual job. It is, above all, true for the work of a group, that is,
for a work process. We need principles of production which enable us to
know how to put together individual operations into individual jobs, and
individual jobs into “production.”</p>
<p>Some of Taylor’s fellow pioneers, especially Gantt, saw this clearly.
The Gantt Chart, in which the steps necessary to obtain a final work
result are worked out by projecting backward, step by step from end
result to actions, their timing and their sequence, though developed
during World War I, is still the one tool we have to identify the
process needed to accomplish a task, whether making a pair of shoes,
landing a man on the moon, or producing an opera. Such recent
innovations as PERT chart, critical path analysis, and network analysis
are elaborations and extensions of Gantt’s work.</p>
<p>But the Gantt Chart tells us very little about the logic that is
appropriate to given kinds of processes. It is, so to speak, the
multiplication table of work design. It does not even</p>
<p>tell us when to multiply, let alone what the purpose of the
calculation is.</p>
<p>Finally, work, precisely because it is a process rather than an
individual operation, needs a built-in control. It needs a feedback
mechanism which both senses unexpected deviations and with them the need
to change the process, and maintains the process at the</p>
<p>level needed to obtain the desired results.</p>
<p>Those three elements, analysis, synthesis into a process of
production, and feedback control, are particularly important in
knowledge work. For knowledge work by definition does not result in a
product. It results in a contribution of knowledge to somebody else. The
output of the knowledge worker always becomes somebody else’s input. It
is, therefore, not self-evident in knowledge work, as it is in making a
pair of shoes, whether the work has results or not. This can be seen
only by projecting backward from the needed end results. At the same
time, knowledge work, being intangible, is not controlled by its own
progress. We do not know the sequence of knowledge work in the way we
know—at least since Taylor and Gantt—the sequence of manual operations.
Knowledge work, therefore, needs far better design, precisely because it
cannot be designed for the worker. It can be designed only by the
worker.</p>
<p>The Five Dimensions of Working</p>
<p>Working is the activity of the worker; it is a human being’s activity
and an essential part of his humanity. It does not have a logic. It has
dynamics and dimensions.</p>
<p>Working has at least five dimensions. In all of them the worker has
to be achieving in order to be productive.</p>
<p>Machine Design and Human Design</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is, first, a physiological dimension. The human being is not a
machine and does not work like a machine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Machines work best if they do only one task, if they do it
repetitively, and if they do the simplest possible task. Complex tasks
are done best as a step-by-step series of simple tasks in which the work
shifts from machine to machine, either by moving the work itself
physicality, as on the assembly line, or, as in modern
computer-controlled machine tools, by bringing machines and tools in
prearranged sequence to the work, with the tool changing with each step
of the process. Machines work best if run at the same speed, the same
rhythm, and with a minimum of moving parts.</p>
<p>The human being is engineered quite differently. For any one task and
any one operation the human being is ill-suited. He lacks strength. He
lacks stamina. He gets fatigued. Altogether he is a very poorly designed
machine tool. The human being excels, however, in coordination. He
excels in relating perception to action. He works best if the entire
human being, muscles, senses, and mind, is engaged by the work.</p>
<p>If confined to an individual motion or operation, the human being
tires fast. This fatigue is not just boredom, which is psychological; it
is genuine physiological fatigue as well. Lactic acid builds up in the
muscles, visual acuity goes down, reaction speed slows and becomes
erratic.</p>
<p>The human being works best at a configuration of operations rather
than at a single operation. But also—and this may be even more
important—the human being is singularly ill-equipped to work at an
unvarying speed and a standard rhythm. He works best if capable of
varying both speed and rhythm fairly frequently.</p>
<p>There is no “one right” speed and no “one right” rhythm for human
beings. Speed, rhythm, and attention span vary greatly among
individuals. Studies of infants strongly indicate that patterns of
speed, rhythm, and attention span are as individual as are fingerprints,
and vary fully as much. Each individual, in other words, has his own
pattern of speeds and his own need to vary speeds. He has his own
pattern of rhythms, and he has his own pattern of attention spans.
Nothing, we now know, creates as much fatigue, as much resistance, as
much anger, and as much resentment, as the imposition of an alien</p>
<p>speed, an alien rhythm, and an alien attention span, and above all,
the imposition of one unvarying and uniform pattern of speed, rhythm,
and attention span. That is alien and physiologically offensive to every
human being. It results speedily in a buildup of toxic wastes in muscle,
brain, and bloodstream, in the release of stress hormones, and in
changes in electrical tension throughout the nervous system. To be
productive the individual has to have control, to a substantial extent,
over the speed, rhythm, and attention spans with which he is
working—just as an infant, learning to speak or to walk, has to have
substantial control over learning speed, learning rhythm, and learning
attention span.</p>
<p>While work is, therefore, best laid out as uniform, working is best
organized with a considerable degree of diversity. Working requires
latitude to change speed, rhythm, and attention span fairly often. It
requires fairly frequent changes in operating routines as well. What is
good industrial engineering for work is exceedingly poor human
engineering for the worker.</p>
<p>Work as Curse and Blessing</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The next dimension of man at work is psychological. Work, we know,
is both a burden and a need, both a curse and a blessing. Whether this
is genetic or culturally conditioned, we do not know—and it does not
greatly matter. By the time a human being has reached the age of four or
five, he has been conditioned to work. To be sure, child labor is
outlawed in most countries, but learning the fundamentals of being a
person, especially learning to talk, is work and creates the habit of
work. Unemployment we long ago learned* creates severe psychological
disturbances, not because of economic deprivation, but primarily because
it undermines self-respect. Work is an extension of personality. It is
achievement. It is one of the ways in which a person defines himself or
herself, measures his worth, and his humanity.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Loafing” is easy, but “leisure” is difficult. For younger people
especially, it is likely to mean frantic activity—or the hard work of
bucking traffic on overcrowded highways— rather than otium cum
dignitate, i.e., philosophical repose. “To be an aristocrat one has to
start learning dignified idleness in early childhood,” was a common
saying in that most snobbish of all Western societies, the Whig society
of late eighteenthand early nineteenth-century England. And, “The devil
finds work for idle hands,” says an even older proverb.</p>
<p>The peculiar characteristic of the work ethic of the West—which goes
back all the way to Saint Benedict of Nursia in the sixth century rather
than to Calvin in the sixteenth—is not that it glorified and sanctified
work. That was neither new nor particularly Western. It sanctified the
“calling”; it preached that all work was service and contribution and
equally deserving of respect. The Benedictine monks made manual work in
field and workshop equal to the work of praying and teaching. This was a
deliberate break with the earlier beliefs of antiquity which held that
the “gentleman” or the “free man” had to be freed from manual chores to
have time for higher work, for learning, for statecraft, for civic
duties, and for military service. As a result, antiquity—but also most
non-Western civilizations—ordered different kinds of work in a hierarchy
of personalities, with manual work pertaining to the ignoble, whether
slave, peasant, or artisan, and soldiers’ and knowledge work pertaining
to the full personality. Neither Socrates nor Cicero believed in
idleness; on the contrary, their full personality was working harder
than the ignoble or obscure—and did more demanding, more responsible
work. When the Chinese Mandarin retired to his ancestral estate after a
successful government career, he was not supposed to lead a life of
leisure. He was supposed instead to take up other but even more
productive work, calligraphy and painting, music and writing. And the
justification of these activities was above all their social
contribution; in the Confucian social ethic, these pursuits are
necessary to maintain the social harmony on which all else depends.</p>
<p>*First in the studies which Paul F. Lazarsfeld and Maria Jahoda
conducted in the twenties among chronically unemployed textile workers
in Austria.</p>
<p>There is little doubt, however that the commercial and industrial
revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries brought a sharp
step-up in the hours man worked— farmers, machine tenders, merchants,
and industrialists alike.</p>
<p>In large measure this reflected a sizable improvement in living
conditions and above all, in nutrition, which greatly increased the
physical energy available for work just as the eighteenth-century
English draft animal, whether horse or ox, could do far more work in the
course of a year than its grandsire a hundred years earlier had been
able to do, because the invention of the silo provided adequate food
during the winter months). No matter how horrible living conditions were
in the nineteenth-century slums of the industrial towns—or today in the
slums and shanty towns that ring Latin America’s cities—they were better
with respect to food than the living conditions under which the landless
laborer or the weavers and spinners in the cottage industries had
subsisted. If anyone doubts this he need only note the food on which
seamen in the sailing vessels were supposed to live and work; there are
abundant records in such literary classics as Dana’s Two Years Before
the Mast, Melville’s Typee and Moby Dick, or in the once widely popular
naval stories of Captain Marryat. Yet sailors, by all reports, were the
best-fed workers, both because the work was hard and made great physical
demands and because of the everpresent danger of mutiny.</p>
<p>The great increase in working in these centuries also represented a
shift in values.</p>
<p>Economic rewards became more meaningful—mostly, perhaps, because
economic satisfactions became more generally available. The proletarian
in the slums of Liverpool or Manchester could not buy much; he lacked
purchasing power. But purchasing power would not have helped his
grandfather, the landless laborer; there wasn’t anything much around to
buy.</p>
<p>The rejection of the work ethic—if there is such a phenomenon outside
of the headlines—therefore does not represent hedonism. In part it
represents a reaction against long decades of overworking, and a
righting of the balance. In larger part it may, however, represent a
return to earlier elitist work concepts which relate certain kinds of
work to nobility or to baseness of the person. What lends support to
this hypothesis is the strong, positive value which the educated young
people who supposedly repudiate the work ethic give to the work of
teacher and artist. Teaching and art, however, are far more demanding
taskmasters than tending machines or selling soap.</p>
<p>The workless society of the futurist utopia may, indeed, be ahead.
Should it come, it would, however, produce a major personality crisis
for most people. It is perhaps fortunate that so far there is not the
slightest fact to support the prediction of the imminent demise of work.
So far the task is still to make work serve the psychological need of
man.</p>
<p>Work as Social and Community Bond</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Work is social bond and community bond. In the employee society it
becomes primary access to society and community. It largely determines
status. For a man to say, “I am a doctor” or “I am a plumber” is a
meaningful statement about himself, his position in society, and his
role in the community.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps more important, work, since time immemorial, has been the
means to satisfy man’s need for belonging to a group and for a
meaningful relationship to others of his kind. When Aristotle said that
man is a zoon politikon, i.e., a social animal he said in effect that
man needs work to satisfy his need for community.</p>
<p>To be sure, few people are determined in their social and community
functions solely by and through the work group to which they belong.
Most people have other societies and communities. It is by no means
unusual to find a man who ranks low socially in his work group but who
is a “big shot” elsewhere; the inconspicuous engineer who is a big man
in the Boy Scouts or in his church, for instance. But even for this man,
work will provide much of his companionship, group identification, and
social bond.</p>
<p>Work is for most people the one bond outside of their own narrow
family—and often more important than the family, especially for the
young not-yet married and for older people whose children have grown up.
This is exemplified strongly by the experience of</p>
<p>companies who hire mature women for part-time work. They make the
most loyal employees. The work place becomes their community, their
social club, their means of escaping loneliness, with their own man at
his job and the children gone.</p>
<p>The Bell Telephone Company, for instance, has many women employees
who leave the job to raise a family but a dozen years tater become
available for part-time work. They are hired to handle clerical peak
loads, especially in such large-scale financial work as new stock or
bond issues, mailing dividends or annual reports, and so on. The work,
when available, is usually rushed and high-pressure, the hours long, and
the pay far from exceptional. Yet the competition for a place on the
roster is intense, and the morale of the group exceptionally high. When,
for whatever reasons, a few rnonths go by without such work, the “old
girls” will start to call in and ask, “How soon can I come in again? I
want to see my friends; I want to know what they are doing; I miss their
company.”</p>
<p>Similarly every company that has polled its retired employees has
found the same reaction. “What we miss isn’t the work; it’s our
colleagues and friends.” “What we want to know isn’t how the company is
doing but what the people do with whom we worked, where they are, how
they are coming along.” “Don’t, please, send me the annual report,” a
retired senior vice-president of a big company once said in a burst of
candor, “I’m no longer interested in sales. Send me the gossip. I miss
even the people I couldn’t stand.”</p>
<p>This last comment puts the finger on the greatest strength of the
work bond and its singular advantage compared to all other bonds of
community. It is not predicated on personal likes or dislikes. It can
function without making emotional demands. A man can work very well with
somebody whom he never sees away from the job, and for whom he feels
neither friendship nor warmth nor liking. He can even function well in a
work relationship with somebody whom he cordially dislikes—if only he
respects the other man’s~ workmanship. But the fellow worker can also be
a close friend with whom one spends as many hours away from work as
possible, with whom one goes hunting or fishing, spends one’s vacation,
spends one’s evenings, and shares much of one’s life. The work
relationship has an objective, outside focus, the work itself. It does
make possible strong social and community bonds that are as personal or
as impersonal as one desires.</p>
<p>This may explain why, throughout man’s history, and above all, among
primitive peoples, work groups have always been sexually differentiated.
Men work together and women work together. But we rarely hear, either in
history or in cultural anthropology, of work groups of mixed sex. Men
hunt and women tend the village. Men build boats and women grow yams. In
Europe women have traditionally milked the cows, in America men; but on
neither side of the Atlantic has milking been done by sexually mixed
groups.</p>
<p>The Economic Dimension</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Work is a “living.” It has an economic component the moment a
society adopts even the most rudimentary division of labor. The moment
people cease to be self-sufficient and begin to exchange the fruits of
their labor, work creates an economic nexus, but also an economic
conflict.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no resolution to this conflict. One has to live with it.
Work is a living for the worker. It is the foundation of his economic
existence. But work also produces the capital for the economy. It
produces the means by which an economy perpetuates itself, provides for
the risks of economic activity and the resources of tomorrow, especially
the resources needed to create tomorrow’s jobs and with them the
livelihood for tomorrow’s workers. There is need in any economy for a
wage fund and for a capital fund.</p>
<p>But the capital fund is in direct competition with the workers’ need
for a livelihood here and now. Marx tried to deny the need for a capital
fund. The great appeal of Marxism to the working man was precisely that
it presented capital accumulation as exploitation and as unnecessary.
The great appeal of Marxism was its prophecy that the capital fund would
disappear once the workers owned the means of production. This very soon
was seen as a total misunderstanding. No matter how bitterly Lenin
attacked the German “revisionist socialists” who pointed out in the
early years of this century that the capital fund was an objective
necessity and not founded in social or power structure, every com-</p>
<p>munist regime, most of all the Soviet Union, has put the capital fund
into the center of its economic planning. In other words, they all have
realized that profit is not a result of power, let alone exploitation,
but objective necessity.*</p>
<p>Still, it does little good to argue, as the classical economists did,
that there is no conflict between the demands of the capital fund, that
is, the demands for a surplus, and the demands of the wage fund. The
classical economists argued that, in the long run, these two harmonize.
The worker needs the capital fund fully as much as he needs the wage
fund. He needs, more than anyone else, to be protected against the risks
of uncertainty. He, more than anyone else, needs the jobs of tomorrow.
The rapid improvement in wages and living standards of the American
worker has in large measure been the result of steadily increasing
capital investment, that is, the capital fund. The researches of Simon
Kuznets (first at the University of Pennsylvania and later at Harvard),
e.g., into capital formation in the United States, have demonstrated
this. But “the worker” is an abstraction. The beneficiary of the capital
fund is rarely the same worker who has made the contribution to the
fund. The capital accumulated in one industry, e.g., the American
textile industry in the l890s, went to finance a new industry such as
the chemical industry, rather than to create new jobs in the textile
industry. Also, the capital fund creates jobs and incomes tomorrow,
whereas the contribution to it has to be made today.</p>
<p>There is, in addition, the tremendous problem of comparative gains
and sacrifices among different kinds of workers. It is probably true, as
labor economists have argued (especially Paul Douglas, originally an
economist at the University of Chicago, and later for many years a
prominent U.S. senator), in their studies of real wages, that
trade-union activities do not—and cannot—much influence the total level
of real wages in an economy. It is still true, however, that one group
of workers, e.g., workers in the building trades, can and do obtain
sizable wage advantages at the cost of other groups of workers.</p>
<p>In other words, it is true that there is no ultimate conflict between
wage fund and capital fund but this is largely irrelevant for the
individual. For him there is a real and immediate conflict.</p>
<p>Work as Living and Work as Wage</p>
<p>There is an even more fundamental conflict between wage as living and
wage as cost. As “living,” wage needs to be predictable, continuous, and
adequate to the expenditures of a family, its aspirations, and its
position in society and community. As “cost,” wage needs to be
appropriate to the productivity of a given employment or industry. It
needs to be flexible and to adjust easily to even minor changes in
supply and demand in the market. It needs to make a product or service
competitive. It is determined, in the last result, by the consumer, that
is, without regard to the needs or expectations of the worker. Again,
here is conflict which cannot easily be resolved and can at best be
assuaged.</p>
<p>No society, no matter how designed, has been able to eliminate these
conflicts. Expropriating the capitalist, the traditional Marxist
formula, does not change the situation. All it might do is to make
possible a larger capital fund because the state has absolute control.
But even this Russia could achieve only by outlawing labor unions. Japan
has traditionally been able to minimize the conflict between wage as
living and wage as cost (see Chapter 20), but rising living standards
threaten the Japanese accommodation. The conflict between wage fund and
capital fund rages as fiercely in Japan as any place else. The
Yugoslavs, by vesting ownership of a plant in the worker’s plant
community, rather than in the state, hoped to abolish the conflict.
Under the Yugoslav system, the needs of the capital fund should be more
clearly apparent to the plant community than under any other system
known so far, but they are being resisted just as much. The Yugoslav
experiment is in danger of collapsing because of the inflationary
pressures generated by workers’ demands for more wages than the
enterprise can afford to pay either under the</p>
<p>*For a cogent restatement of the dilemma by a contemporary, orthodox
Marxist, see Michael Harrington, Socialism (Saturday Review Press,
1972).</p>
<p>aspect of wages as cost or in consideration of its own and the
economy’s need for the capital fund.</p>
<p>Worker ownership has been the alternative to both capitalism, that
is, ownership by the providers of capital, and nationalization, that is,
ownership by the government. It has a long—though not a very
distinguished—history. Today it is again being proposed seriously,
especially by such men as Ota Sik, the architect of the economic
liberalization in Czechoslovakia which the Russians crushed.</p>
<p>A financial stake in the business must always remain a secondary
interest to the worker compared to his job. Even in the most prosperous
business, profit, that is, the contribution to the capital fund, is
never more than a small fraction of wages. In manufacturing industries,
wage costs typically are 40 percent or so of gross sales. Profits after
taxes are rarely more than 5 or 6 percent, that is, one-eighth of wage
costs. In the total economy the wage and salary bill runs around 65
percent of gross national product, profits fluctuate from zero to 7
percent or so—they are at most one-tenth of the wage bill (most of the
remainder is income of small proprietors, farmers, shopkeepers,
professionals, that is, in effect, another compensation for labor rather
than contribution to the capital fund, i.e., profits).</p>
<p>Profits, at their lushest, can, therefore, rarely contribute more
than a very small additional bonus—welcome but not fundamental.</p>
<p>It is also highly debatable whether worker ownership is in the
worker’s own financial interest. No enterprise will be profitable
forever. And if the worker then, as in the typical worker-ownership
plan, is dependent for his future, e.g., for his retirement benefits, on
investment in the company he works for, he is exceedingly vulnerable.
The worker should no more than any other investor have all his financial
eggs in one basket. In that respect, the approach to pensions adopted in
the United States in the last twenty-five years— development of a
pension fund which invests broadly, and typically does not invest at all
in the business that employs the future beneficiaries—is financially far
sounder and far more in the worker’s own financial interest than worker
ownership in the enterprise he works for.</p>
<p>From a theoretical point of view, the developments in the United
States during the last twenty or thirty years would seem to represent
the optimal approach to the resolution of these conflicts. The employees
of American business are gradually becoming the true “owners” through
their pension funds and mutual funds, which have become the dominant
investors in—the American economy. By now these institutional investors,
i.e., the trustees for the employee and his savings, control, in effect,
the large publicly owned American corporations. America, in other words,
has socialized ownership without nationalizing it. Yet this has by no
means resolved—or even lessened—the conflict between wage fund and
capital fund and between wage as living and wage as cost.</p>
<p>It would help if we learned to think and speak of the costs of
capital and of the costs of the future rather than of profit. (It would
also, as was said in Chapter 6, result in raising profitability
requirements). But it would only help; it would not make the conflicts
go, away. They are built into this situation, whether business operates
in a market economy or in a government-run one, whether it is privately
owned, government-owned, or plant community-owned.</p>
<p>The Power Dimension of Working</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>There is always a power relationship implicit in working within a
group, and especially in working within an organization.</li>
</ol>
<p>The farmer of old who tilled his own stony acres had to impose on
himself a very strict discipline. What he wanted to do was not very
relevant, if haying had to be done. But the forces to which he was
subordinated were impersonal. They were wind and weather, season and
frost, or the impersonal forces of a market. But in any organization, no
matter how small, there has to be a personal authority. The organization
member’s will is subordinated to an alien will.</p>
<p>The imposition of the clock on a man’s life which forces him to come
to work at a given hour might appear a trivial exercise of power, and
one that affects everybody equally. But it came as a tremendous shock to
pre-industrial people, whether peasants in developing countries, the
former craftsmen in the mills of England in the early years of the
industrial revolution, or Blacks from the ghettos of the American city
today. In an organization jobs have to be designed, structured, and
assigned. Work has to be done on schedule and in a prearranged sequence.
People are promoted or not promoted. In short, authority has to be
exercised by someone.</p>
<p>Anarchists are right in their assertion that “organization is
alienation.” Modern organization theorists such as Yale University’s
Chris Argyris who hope for organization without alienation are romantics
(though many of their concrete proposals for “participation” are highly
constructive, and needed). Modern society is an employee society and
will remain one. This means power relationships that affect everybody
directly and in his capacity as a worker. Authority is an essential
dimension of work. It has little or nothing to do with ownership of the
means of production, democracy at the work place, worker representation
at the board of directors, or any other way of structuring the “system.”
It is inherent in the fact of organization.</p>
<p>The Sixth Dimension: The Power Dimension of Economics</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>In al1 modern, organization there is what might be called a sixth
dimension of working a need for authority with respect to economic
shares.</li>
</ol>
<p>Power and economics are inextricably tied together in the modern
organization, whether business enterprise, government agency,
university, or hospital. Apportioning the economic rewards of the
members of the institution demands a central organ of authority with
power of decision. The reason is not capitalism or any other “ism.” It
is the fundamental fact that the modern institution is an organ of
society, existing to provide satisfactions outside of itself. It,
therefore, must obtain its revenue from the outside—either from a
customer in the marketplace, from the taxpayers through a budget-making
authority, or from preset fees paid by users such as patients in a
hospital, patrons of the post office, or students in a college. At the
same time, the contribution of the individual member of the institution
cannot be directly related to the revenue. It is impossible to say, even
approximately, how much of the sales of a business an individual
employee contributes, whether chief executive or lowliest sweeper. The
same is true of hospital or university. Does the great scholar in
ancient Chinese with his six graduate students contribute more or less
than the graduate assistant teaching English composition to a freshman
class of 150? And what about the dean? All one can say is that
everybody’s contribution is, in theory, indispensable, although not
everybody’s contribution enters into every single product or
performance, nor is everybody’s contribution in any way equal in
importance, skill, or difficulty.</p>
<p>An authority is, therefore, needed which divides the revenue
available among the members. The institution itself, whether business
enterprise or hospital, is necessarily a redistributive system.</p>
<p>Where the contributions are simple, similar, and few in number,
redistribution on the basis of complete equality is possible. This is,
for instance, the case in the Israeli kibbutz, where everybody works on
the farm, producing a very few products, most of them for</p>
<p>internal consumption, that is, for basic self-sufficiency. But the
moment the kibbutz went into industrial production, as a good many did,
it had to abandon the principle of primitive socialism on which it had
been founded and under which everybody receives exactly the same. It had
to become an employer. In Israel the Trade Union Federation owns most of
industry and is the country’s leading employer. Most of Israel’s
industry is, in effect, “socialized,” but that has not in any way
changed the power position of, the “employer” nor eliminated the
problems of labor relations. While the kibbutz has had enormous
psychological and political impact on Zionism, its economic role in
Israel is almost negligible and is shrinking. Kibbutzim now contain less
than 5 percent of Israel’s population; and the young are leaving them
for the fleshpots of the consumer society of the cities.</p>
<p>The simple fact that the results of a modern institution always lie
outside of itself and that, therefore, the economic rewards for its
members always come from the outside and are not determined internally,
inescapably leads to power and authority. In fact, it creates two power
relationships. There is a power relationship between management and
labor. But the various groups within the work force, while in a common
power relationship to management, also stand in sharp and intense
competition to each other with respect to their relative shares in the
total “product” available for internal distribution.</p>
<p>Marx might have been excused, a century ago, for believing that the
transfer of the title of ownership would resolve this problem—though his
predecessors, the utopian socialists, especially the French such as
Fourier, saw, long before Marx, that the problem lay in the nature of
modern institutions rather than in “exploitation,” ownership, or any
other legal, political, or social structure. Fourier in particular saw
that the industrial democracy required a completely self-contained and
self-sufficient economic unit, that is, something like an Israeli
kibbutz.</p>
<p>If the last hundred years have taught us anything, however, it is
that the distribution problem is generic rather than historical. It
cannot be manipulated away. There has to be a decision how to divide the
revenue available from the outside among the members inside the
enterprise. The moment the institution, business, hospital, or other,
produces more than a very few simple commodities, meant mostly for
consumption within the group, the relationship between the individual
input and the institution’s output can no longer be determined
“impersonally” or “scientifically.” At this moment also, equality of
reward becomes at once impossible—as the Russians learned in the
thirties, and as all other socialist experimenters, e.g., the Yugoslavs
and the Chinese, have learned since.</p>
<p>There has then to be a redistribution and an authority to make the
redistribution decisions. Redistribution, however, is, in effect, a
political rather than an economic decision. It is influenced and
restrained by a great number of forces: supply and demand, social
convention, traditions, and so on. But in the last analysis, a decision
by authority and a decision based on power structure and power
relationships has to be made somehow by somebody. And this decision, no
modern institution—and least of all, the business enterprise—can
escape.</p>
<p>The Fallacy of the Dominant Dimension</p>
<p>These dimensions of working—the physiological, the psychological, the
social, the economic, and the power dimension—are separate. Each
can—and, indeed, should—be analyzed separately and independently. But
they always exist together in the worker’s situation and in his
relationship to work and job, fellow workers and management. They have
to be managed together. Yet they do not pull in the same direction. The
demands of one dimension are quite different from those of another.</p>
<p>The basic fallacy of our traditional approaches to working has been
to proclaim one of these dimensions to be the dimension.</p>
<p>Marx—and most other economists—saw the economic dimension as
dominating everything else. If only economic relationships could be
changed, there would be no more alienation. Marxism became bankrupt when
it became apparent that the “expropriation” of the “exploiters” did not
fundamentally change the worker’s situation and his alienation</p>
<p>because it did not change in any way any of the other dimensions (and
did not indeed even change the economic problem).</p>
<p>This explains, by the way, the vogue of the “young Marx” among
Marxists today.</p>
<p>This—largely fictitious—personage is said to have seen alienation as
the existential evil of the social system and as moral rather than as
purely economic. But it did not take the mature Marx long to realize
that neither program nor action could be based on such general and vague
Weltschmerz.</p>
<p>Elton Mayo, to give another and radically different example, saw the
dominant dimension as the interpersonal relations within the work group,
that is, in psychological and social aspects. And yet it is not only
true that one cannot “hire a hand; the whole man always comes with it”;
the work itself matters and affects group relations. And neither the
economic nor the power dimension were seen by Mayo and his
associates.</p>
<p>These dimensions stand in highly complex relationship to each other.
They are a true “configuration” but one that changes rapidly as the
worker’s circumstances change.</p>
<p>The late Abraham H. Maslow, the father of humanist psychology,*
showed that human wants form a hierarchy. As a want of a lower order is
being satisfied, it becomes less and less important, with a want of the
next-highest order becoming more and more important. Maslow applied to
human wants what might be called “marginal utility”—and his was a
profound and lasting insight. Maslow put economic want at the bottom and
the need for self-fulfillment at the top. But the order is not of first
importance. What matters is the insight that wants are not absolute; the
more one want is being satisfied, the less its satisfaction matters.</p>
<p>But what Maslow did not see is that a want changes in the act of
being satisfied. As the economic want becomes satisfied, that is, as
people no longer have to subordinate every other human need and human
value to getting the next meal, it becomes less and less satisfying to
obtain more economic rewards. This does not mean that economic rewards
became less important. On the contrary, while the ability of the
economic reward to provide a positive incentive diminishes, its capacity
to create dissatisfaction, if disappointed, rapidly increases.† In
Herzberg’s words, economic rewards cease to be “incentives” and become
“hygiene factors.” If not properly taken care of that is, if there is
dissatisfaction with the economic rewards—they become deterrents.</p>
<p>This is, we now know, to be true of every one of Maslow’s wants. As a
want approaches satiety, its capacity to reward and with it its power as
an incentive diminishes fast. But its capacity to deter, to create
dissatisfaction, and to act as a disincentive rapidly increases.</p>
<p>Two vice-presidents in the same company whose salaries are only a few
hundred dollars apart are equals economically. At that salary level, the
income tax is so high as to make the pay differential meaningless. Yet
the vice-president with the lower salary may be eaten up by frustration
and envy. No matter how good his income, it will be a thorn in his side.
The same applies all the way down the organization. Every trade-union
leader knows that his biggest problem today is not absolute pay scales.
It is the pay differentials among various kinds of workers within his
union. There is no way of satisfying either the skilled worker who
insists on receiving 20 percent more than the semiskilled man, or the
semiskilled man. They are equally dissatisfied. If the pay differential
is being narrowed, the skilled worker will feel that he has been
deprived. And if the differential is not being narrowed, the semiskilled
worker will feel deprived.</p>
<p>But also, contrary to what Maslow seemed to imply, the various
dimensions of man at work change their character as they approach being
satisfied. Pay, as we have just seen, becomes part of the social or
psychological dimension rather than the economic one.</p>
<p>*Especiaily in his book, Motivation and Personality (Harper
andandandand Row, 1954).</p>
<p>†This was first noted in my book, The New Society. Since then
Frederick Herzberg has provided ample documentation in his two books,
The Motivation to Work (Wiley, 1959) and Work and the Nature of Man
(World, l966).</p>
<p>The opposite can also happen; power and status can become the basis
for economic demands. In Yugoslav industry, for instance, the worker
representatives on the workers’ council, who hold positions of great
social prestige and considerable power, almost immediately want more
money as well. At the least, they want perquisites—housing, an office, a
secretary, preferential prices at the company store, and so on—which
are, as they see it, economic rewards befitting their new rank.</p>
<p>We need to know much more than we now know about the dimensions of
working and about their relationships. We are dealing with a
configuration likely to defy analysis.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the manager has to manage now. He has to find
solutions—or at least accommodations—which will enable him to make work
productive and the worker achieving. He has to understand what the
demands are. He cannot expect to succeed by continuing the practices of
the last two hundred years. He will have to develop new approaches, new
principles, and new methods—and fast.</p>
