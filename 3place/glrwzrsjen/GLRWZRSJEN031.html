<h4 id="why-managers">29 Why Managers?</h4>
<p>Managers, the Basic Resource of a Business, the Scarcest, Most
Expensive, and Most Perishable—The Ford Story: A Controlled Experiment
in Mismanagement—Siemens and Mitsubishi as Examples—Ford and Lenin—The
Lesson of the Ford Story— Management Precedes Ownership—The “Management
Lag” of British Industry— Management “Change of Phase” Rather Than
Adaptation—Management, an Autonomous Function, Not a Delegated One</p>
<p>M</p>
<p>ANAGERS ARE THE BASIC RESOURCE of the business enterprise. In a fully
automatic factory there may be almost no rank-and-file employees at all.
But there will be managers—in fact, there will be many more than there
used to be in the factory of yesterday.</p>
<p>Managers are the most expensive resource in most businesses—and the
one that de- preciates the fastest and needs the most constant
replenishment. It takes years to build a management team; but it can be
depleted in a short period of misrule. The number of managers as well as
the capital investment each manager represents are bound to increase
steadily—as they have increased in the past half century. Parallel with
this will go an in- crease in the demands of the enterprise on the
ability of its managers. These demands have doubled in every generation;
there is no reason to expect a slowing down of the trend during the next
decades.</p>
<p>How well managers manage and are managed determines whether business
goals will be reached. It also largely determines how well the
enterprise manages worker and work. For the worker’s attitude reflects,
above all, the attitude of his management. It directly mirrors
management’s competence and structure. The worker’s effectiveness is
deter- mined largely by the way he is being managed.</p>
<p>During the last quarter century managers everywhere have subjected
themselves to a steady barrage of exhortations, speeches, and programs
in which they tell each other that their job is to manage the people
under them, urge each other to give top priority to that responsibility,
and furnish each other with copious advice and expensive gadgets for
“downward communications.” But I have yet to sit down with a manager,
whatever his level or job, who was not primarily concerned with his
upward relations and upward communications.* Every vice-president feels
that relations with the president are the real problem. And so on down
to the first-line supervisor, the production foreman, or chief clerk,
who is quite certain that he could get along with his men if only the
“boss” and the personnel department left him alone.</p>
<p>This is not, as personnel people seem inclined to think, a sign of
the perversity of hu- man nature. Upward relations are properly a
manager’s first concern. To be a manager means sharing in the
responsibility for the performance of the enterprise. A man who is not
expected to take this responsibility is not a manager.</p>
<p>*This will be treated further in Chapter 38, “Managerial
Communications.”</p>
<p>These problems of upward relations that worry the manager—the
relationship to his own boss; his doubts as to what is expected of him;
his difficulty in getting his point across, his program accepted, his
activity given full weight; the relations with other de- partments and
with staff people, and so forth—are all problems of managing
managers.</p>
<p>The Rise, Decline and Rebirth of Ford</p>
<p>The story of Henry Ford, his rise and decline, and of the revival of
his company under his grandson, Henry Ford II, has been told so many
times that it has passed into folklore. Everybody has heard</p>
<p>• that Henry Ford, starting with nothing in 1905, had built fifteen
years later the world’s largest and most profitable manufacturing
enterprise;</p>
<p>• that the Ford Motor Company, in the early twenties, dominated and
almost</p>
<p>monopolized the American automobile market and held a leadership
position in most of the other important automobile markets of the
world;</p>
<p>• that, in addition, it had amassed, out of profits, cash reserves of
a billion dol- lars or so;</p>
<p>• that, only a few years later, by 1927, this seemingly impregnable
business</p>
<p>empire was in shambles. Having lost its leadership position and
barely able to stay a poor third in the market, it lost money almost
every year for twenty years or so, and remained unable to compete
vigorously right through World War II; and</p>
<p>• that in 1944 the founder’s grandson, Henry Ford II, then only
twenty-six years old and without training or experience, took over,
ousted two years later his grandfather’s cronies in a palace coup,
brought in a totally new man- agement team and saved the company.</p>
<p>But it is not commonly realized that this dramatic story is far more
than a story of per- sonal success and failure. It is, above all, what
one might call a controlled experiment in mismanagement.</p>
<p>The first Ford failed because of his firm conviction that a business
did not need man- agers and management. All it needed, he believed, was
the owner-entrepreneur with his “helpers.” The only difference between
Ford and most of his contemporaries in business, in the U.S. as well as
abroad, was that, as in everything he did,* Henry Ford stuck uncom-
promisingly to his convictions. The way he applied them—e.g., by firing
or sidelining any one of his “helpers,” no matter how able, who dared
act as a “manager,” make a decision, or take action without orders from
Ford—can only be described as a test of a hypothesis that ended up by
fully disproving it.</p>
<p>In fact, what makes the Ford story unique—but also important—is that
Ford could test the hypothesis, in part because he lived so long, and in
part because he had a billion dol- lars to back his convictions. Ford’s
failure was not the result of personality or tempera- ment but first and
foremost a result of his refusal to accept managers and management as
necessary and as grounded in task and function rather than in
“delegation” from the “boss.”</p>
<p>But Ford was by no means alone in his belief that managers are
unnecessary. This is shown by the experience of two other major growth
businesses of the period before World War I: Siemens in Germany and
Mitsubishi in Japan.</p>
<p>Werner von Siemens (1816-1892) was as different a personality from
Henry Ford as can be imagined. One of the nineteenth century’s greatest
inventors, he was a man of ut- most concern and consideration for
people, whether workers or fellow scientists. To this day the company he
founded is characterized by a rare sense of mutual loyalty and of
re-</p>
<p>*On Henry Ford, see my essay “Henry Ford” in my book, Men, Ideas and
Politics (Harper andandandand Row, 1971); English edition is called The
New Markets (Heinemenn, 1971).</p>
<p>sponsibility for people. But Siemens did not have “managers.” He had
“helpers” and “as- sistants.” Growing spectacularly until the late
1870s, the company began to slow down, gradually slipped out of control,
and became “unmanageable” and practically unmanaged. The English Siemens
company, originally the most prosperous business of the Siemens group,
was destroyed by mismanagement and had to be abandoned. When competition
appeared in the late eighties—especially from the German General
Electric Company (AEG) founded by Emil Rathenau in close cooperation
with the American General Elec- tric Company—Siemens, despite its long
lead, rapidly lost ground in the very markets it had formerly dominated.
Unlike Ford though, Siemens did not have practically unlimited financial
resources. When, in 1897, five years after the founder’s death, the
company had to take recourse to the capital market, a banker—Georg
Siemens, a cousin of Werner and</p>
<p>by that time head of the Deutsche Bank (see Chapter 49)—used the need
for money to force the founder’s reluctant sons and heirs to accept a
management structure and manag- ers.</p>
<p>Descendants of the founder remained powerful in the company until
World War II and still sit on the company’s board today, but the
reorganization of 1897 created managerial jobs that were grounded in
task and function, and independent of the whims—and even the wishes—of
the family members. Within a few years the company, which had been
floundering, had regained its vigor; in the early years of the century,
when the German electrical industry went through a period of shake-outs
and consolidations, it was around Siemens that the new industry
structure was being built. The new, professional manage- ment, brought
in ten years earlier under Georg Siemens’s pressure, and largely from
within the company, worked out these mergers and integrated the newly
acquired compa- nies into the Siemens structure, thus ensuring for the
company another forty years of lead- ership in Europe’s electrical
industry.</p>
<p>Yataro Iwasaki (1834-1885), the founder of Mitsubishi, was also a
personality totally different from Henry Ford, and from Werner von
Siemens as well. He had, to the highest degree, the faculty of
attracting, developing, and using first-rate men. But, like the other
two men, he did not believe in managers. In a sharp and conscious break
with the Japa- nese tradition of the Ie—the “household community” in
which power goes by seniority rather than ownership and in which work is
done by teams*—Iwasaki insisted on the sole authority and responsibility
of the owner-entrepreneur. This, to him, was “progressive” and
“Western.” Like Ford he was forced to incorporate his company. Like Ford
he con- sidered this a mere formality—an irksome one, to boot—and
decreed that all ownership should forever be vested in one man: the head
of the family. This man, and this man alone, should make all the
decisions; the others should be his “assistants” and carry out his
orders. Iwasaki started in 1867—right after the Meiji Restoration—as a
penniless samurai (hereditary warrior). Fifteen years later his concern
was the leading industry in Japan, having outstripped the much older
business powers, Mitsui and Sumitomo, whose roots went back to the
seventeenth century. But by that time—comparable to Ford’s situa- tion
in 1920—Mitsubishi began to slow down, to drift, and to show clear signs
of incipi- ent decay. Fortunately for the company, Iwasaki died, barely
fifty years old, in 1885. His trusted associates, though sworn to uphold
the constitution he had laid down and to vest full authority in the head
of thc family, immediately restructured and built the strongest, most
truly professional and most autonomous management group in Japan, from
which the family, while treated with the greatest deference, was
completely excluded. And it was then that the rise and growth of
Mitsubishi truly began.</p>
<p>But it was not only the nineteenth-century business leader who
refused to accept man- agers and management. Lenin also did not accept
management; and his refusal underlies basic problems and difficulties of
communism.</p>
<p>It can be argued that Ford’s personal misrule, his estrangement from
reality and his in- creasing dependence on a secret police chief who
ruled through espionage and terror were</p>
<p>*On this see Chie Nakane, Japanese Society (University of California
Press, 1970), a “must” for anyone who wants to understand how Japanese
organizations work.</p>
<p>not so much traits of his personality as consequences of his
doctrine. Similarly, it may well be that Stalinism, with its terror,
purges, paranoid suspicions, and dependence on police informers and
toadies, reflects the inevitable—consequences of the belief that
managers and management are superfluous and that the “great man” can
govern big and complex organizations and structures with his assistants
and helpers—that is, his courti- ers.</p>
<p>GM—The Counter-test</p>
<p>In the early twenties, when Ford set out to prove that managers are
not needed, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., the newly appointed president of
General Motors, put the opposite thesis to the test. GM at that time was
almost crushed by the towering colossus of the Ford Motor Company and
barely able to survive as a weak number two. Little more than a
jerry-built financial speculation, stitched together out of small
automobile companies that had been for sale because they could not stand
up to Ford’s competition, GM did not have one win- ning car in its line,
no dealer organization, and no financial strength. Each of the former
owners was allowed autonomy, which in effect meant that he was allowed
to mismanage his former business his own way and as his own personal
fief. But Sloan thought through what the business and structure of GM
should be* and converted his undisciplined barons into a management
team. Within five years GM had become the leader in the American
automobile industry and has remained the leader ever since.</p>
<p>Then, twenty years later, Henry Ford’s grandson put Sloan’s
hypothesis to the test again. The Ford Motor Company by then was nearly
bankrupt; the entire billion dollars of cash assets it had held in the
early twenties had been poured into paying for the deficits since. As
soon as young Henry Ford II took over in 1946, he set out to do for his
com- pany what Sloan had done for GM two decades earlier. He created a
management struc- ture and a management team. Within five years the Ford
Motor Company regained its potential for growth and profit, both at home
and abroad. It became the main competitor to General Motors and even
outstripped GM in the fast-growing European automobile market.</p>
<p>The Lesson of the Ford Story</p>
<p>The lesson of the Ford story is that managers and management are the
specific need of the business enterprise, its specific organ, and its
basic structure. We can say dogmatically that enterprise cannot do
without managers. One cannot argue that management does the owner’s job
by delegation. Management is needed not only because the job is too big
for any one man to do himself, but because managing an enterprise is
something essentially different from managing one’s own property.</p>
<p>Henry Ford—and Siemens and Iwasaki—failed to see the need to change
to managers and management because they believed (as the textbooks still
tell us) that a large and complex business enterprise “evolves”
organically from the small one-man shop. Of course, Ford, Siemens, and
Iwasaki started small. But the growth brought more than a change in
size. At one point quantity turned into quality. At one point they no
longer ran “their own business” but moved over into a business
enterprise, that is, into an organiza- tion requiring different
structure and different principles—an organization requiring man- agers
and management.</p>
<p>Legally, management is still seen as delegation from ownership, even
in the Soviet system. But the actual doctrine that is slowly evolving is
that management precedes and indeed outranks ownership, at least in the
large enterprise. Even total ownership of such an enterprise is
dependent on proper management. If the owner does not subordinate him-
self to the enterprise’s need for management his ownership—while legally
unrestricted— will in fact be curtailed, if not taken away from him.</p>
<p>*On Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., see my book Managing for Results and
Sloan’s own book, My Years with General Motors (Doubleday, 1964).</p>
<p>This was, one assumes, in Georg Siemens’s mind when he confronted his
young cous- ins with the choice between accepting management or being
ousted from control. As legal doctrine—though a nascent rather than a
clearly formulated one—it probably was first laid down by the U.S. Air
Force in the early fifties in dealing with Howard Hughes and the Hughes
Aircraft Company. Hughes owned the company lock, stock, and barrel. He
refused to let professional managers run it and insisted on running it
himself the way Ford, thirty years earlier, had run the Ford Motor
Company. Thereupon the Air Force, the company’s main customer, gave
Hughes an ultimatum: either you put your shares into a trust and let
professional management take over, or we put the company into bankruptcy
and force you out altogether. Hughes retained ownership title through
one of his founda- tions but relinquished control entirely.</p>
<p>The next case also concerns Howard Hughes. As all but complete owner
of one of America’s major airlines, TWA, he, it is alleged, subordinated
TWA’s interests to those of other companies of his. For an owner this is
perfectly legitimate behavior; he is sup- posed to do with his property
as he pleases. But TWA management sued Hughes for 50 million in damages.
It lost the suit only in 1973 in the Supreme Court—having won it in two
lower courts—on a technicality; the Supreme Court ruled that this was a
matter for the Civil Aeronautics Board over which the ordinary courts
had no jurisdiction. But the principle that even the owner has to act as
a manager, at least in a large company, was not disputed.</p>
<p>The same principle also underlies the treatment of the Krupp family
when the German banks came to their company’s rescue in the late
sixties. The company was wholly owned by the family. But the banks
clearly felt that Krupp’s treatment of the company as prop- erty was
improper. Whereas Siemens, seventy years earlier, had still tried to
maintain family ownership, the German banks in the Krupp settlement
forced the family to divest themselves completely of both ownership and
control.</p>
<p>Genetically, so to speak, management did not evolve out of the small
owner-managed firm and as a result of its growth. It was designed ab
initio for enterprises that were large and complex to begin with.</p>
<p>The large American railroad which covered vast distances—and which
wrestled with the complex interplay between the engineering task of
building a railbed, the financial task of raising very large sums of
capital, and the political-relations tasks of obtaining charters, land
grants, and subsidies—was the first enterprise that can be called “man-
aged.” Indeed, the management structure designed shortly after the Civil
War for the first long-distance and transcontinental American railroads
has essentially remained un- changed to this day. In continental Europe,
at about the same time, management was de- signed for the first banks
founded expressly to be national rather than local banks.* And in
faraway Japan, the builders of the Zaibatsu of the Meiji Period—Mitsui,
Sumitomo, and Iwasaki’s successors at Mitsubishi—using traditional
Japanese approaches in a new man- ner, also fashioned a management
system for the large and complex enterprise.</p>
<p>It was not until thirty or forty years later that the concept of
management was trans- ferred from the enterprise that started out large
to the enterprise that had grown large. How George Siemens forced his
reluctant cousins at the Siemens Electrical Company to do so in 1897 by
using their need for capital as a lever has already been recounted. At
about the same time Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, Jr.,
introduced manage- ment into the steel and petroleum industries
respectively. A little later still Pierre S. du Pont restructured the
family company (E.I. du Pont de Nemours andandandand Co.) and gave it a
management, both to make it capable of growth and to preserve family
control.† The management structure Pierre du Pont built in his family
company between 1915 and 1920 became, a few years later, the starting
point for the General Motors structure of “profes-</p>
<p>*On this see the story of Georg Siemens and the Deutsche Bank, in
Chapter 49.</p>
<p>†On Pierre du Pont see Alfed D. Chandler, Jr., and Stephen Salisbury,
Pierre S. du Pont and the Making of the Modern Corporation (Harper
andandandand Row, 1971); also Alfred J. Chandler, Jr., Strategy and
Structure (M.I.T. Press, 1962).</p>
<p>sional management” after the Du Ponts had acquired control of the
near-bankrupt and floundering automotive conglomerate and had put Alfred
P. Sloan, Jr., in as president.</p>
<p>It cannot be proven, but there is a high probability that the decline
of Great Britain in the late nineteenth century from her position of
economic world leadership was not pri- marily caused by technological
lag but by management lag, that is, by the failure to re- structure what
had become large and complex enterprises on a genuine managerial foun-
dation.</p>
<p>Rather than restructure their companies the British compromised. The
“board” became neither a supervisory organ nor genuine management but a
mixture of the two. As a result the role, function, and authority of
managers was not clearly established. To see the dif- ference one need
only compare the account of the development of the British chemical
industry*—the world leader in 1870, the “also ran” twenty years
later—with Chandler’s account of the Du Ponts. As late as 1926, when
Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was formed by merging all large
British chemical companies into one, the first “board” was both the top
management organ and a mélange of wealthy amateurs representing former
founder-families—without clear structure within the board or below it.
The German I.G. Farben was formed in a similar fashion a few months
earlier. But from the beginning the Germans took financial, family, and
prestige problems out of the management structure and dumped them on a
non-managing board of supervisors. A few members of the found- ing
families were taken on the board of management. But they served as
professional managers, that is, had a specific job, function, and
authority, and were equals on a team dominated by professionals without
family or ownership background.</p>
<p>Management as a “Change of Phase”</p>
<p>The change from a business which the owner-entrepreneur can run with
“helpers” to a business that requires a management is what the
physicists call a “change of phase” such as the change from fluid to
solid. It is a leap from one state of matter, from one fundamen- tal
structure, to another. Sloan’s example shows that it can be made within
one and the same organization. But Sloan’s restructuring of GM also
shows that the job can be done only if basic concepts, basic principles,
and individual vision are changed radically.</p>
<p>One can compare the business which the older Ford tried to run and
the business which Sloan designed to two different kinds of
organisms—the insect, which is held to- gether by a tough, hard skin,
and the vertebrate animal, which has a skeleton. The English biologist
D’Arcy Thompson showed that animals supported by a hard skin can reach
only a certain size and complexity. Beyond this, a land animal has to
have a skeleton. Yet the skeleton has not genetically evolved out of the
hard skin of the insect; it is a different or- gan with different
antecedents. Similarly, management becomes necessary when a busi- ness
reaches a certain size and complexity. But management, while it replaces
the “hard- skin” structure of the owner-entrepreneur, is not its
successor. It is, rather, its replace- ment.</p>
<p>When does a business reach the stage at which it has to shift from
“hard skin” to “skeleton”? The line lies somewhere between 300 and 1,000
employees in size. More important, perhaps, is the increase in
complexity; when a variety of tasks have all to be performed in
cooperation, synchronization, and communication a business needs manag-
ers and a management. Otherwise, things go out of control; plans fail to
turn into action; or, worse, different parts of the plans get going at
different speeds, different times, and with different objectives and
goals, and the favor of the “boss” becomes more important than
performance. At this point the product may be excellent, the people able
and dedi- cated. The boss may be—indeed often is—a man of great ability
and personal power. But the business will begin to flounder, stagnate,
and soon go downhill unless it shifts to the “skeleton” of managers and
management structure.</p>

1874-1926 (Oxford University Press, 1970).</p>
<p>Henry Ford—like the young Siemenses, Iwasaki, and Lenin—wanted no
managers.</p>
<p>But the only result was that he misdirected managers, set up their
jobs improperly, created a spirit of suspicion and frustration,
misorganized his company and stunted or broke man- agement people. The
only choice management has in these areas is therefore whether it will
do the jobs well or badly. But the jobs themselves cannot be evaded. And
whether they are being done right or not will determine largely whether
the enterprise will survive and prosper or decline and ultimately
fall.</p>
