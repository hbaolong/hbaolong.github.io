<h4 id="managing-service-institutions-for-performance">14 Managing
Service Institutions for Performance</h4>
<p>Principles of Effectiveness in Service Institutions—How to Apply the
Principles—The Three Kinds of Service Institutions and Their Specific
Needs—Auditing Objectives and Activities for Organized
Abandonment—Managing Service Institutions for Performance</p>
<p>Different classes of service institutions need different structures.
But all of them, we may conclude, need first to impose on themselves
such discipline as did the managers and leaders of the institutions in
the examples in Chapter 13.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>They need to define “what is our business and what should it be.”
They need to bring alternatives of definition into the open, and to
think them through carefully, perhaps even to work out (as did the
presidents of the emerging American universities) the balance of
different and perhaps even conflicting definitions of “what our business
is and what it should be.”</p></li>
<li><p>They need to derive clear objectives and goals from their
definition of function and mission.</p></li>
<li><p>They then have to think through priorities of concentration which
enable them to select targets, to set standards of accomplishment and
performance, that is, to define the minimum acceptable results; to set
deadlines; to go to work on results, and to make someone accountable for
results.</p></li>
<li><p>They need to define measurements of performance—the
customer-satisfaction measurements of the Telephone Company, or the
literacy figures by which the men of Meiji measured their
progress.</p></li>
<li><p>They need to use these measurements to feed back on their
efforts, that is, to build self-control from results into their
system.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, they need an organized audit of objectives and results,
so as to identify those objectives that no longer serve a purpose or
have proven unattainable. They need to identify unsatisfactory
performance, and activities which are obsolete or unproductive, or both.
And, they need a mechanism for sloughing off such activities rather than
wasting their money and their energies where the results are
unsatisfactory.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The last requirement may be the most important one. The absence of a
market test removes from the service institution the discipline that
forces a business eventually to abandon yesterday—or else go bankrupt.
Assessing and abandoning low-performance activities in service
institutions, outside and inside business, would be the most painful but
also the most salutary innovation.</p>
<p>To test objectives and their appropriateness, priorities, and, above
all, results against expectations, is perhaps needed most for
yesterday’s successes.</p>
<p>No success, as our examples show, is “forever.” Yet it is far more
difficult to abandon yesterday’s success than it is to reappraise
failure. Success breeds its own hubris. It creates emotional attachment,
habits of mind and action, and, above all, false selfconfidence. A
success that has outlived its usefulness may, in the end, be more
damaging than failure.</p>
<p>In a service institution particularly, yesterday’s success becomes
“policy,” “virtue,”</p>
<p>“conviction,” if not holy writ, unless the institution imposes on
itself the discipline of thinking through its mission, its objectives,
and its priorities, and of building in feedback control from results and
performance on policies, priorities, and action. We are in such a
“welfare mess” today in the United States, largely because the welfare
program of the New Deal had been such a success in the thirties that we
could not abandon it and, instead, misapplied it to the radically
different problem of the Black immigrants in the cities in the fifties
and sixties.</p>
<p>To make service institutions perform, it should by now be clear, does
not require great men. It requires instead a system. The essentials of
this system are not too different from the essentials of performance in
a business enterprise, but the application will be quite different. The
service institutions are not businesses; performance means something
quite different in them.</p>
<p>The applications of the essentials will and should differ greatly for
different service institutions. As our examples showed—and were meant to
show—there are at least three different kinds of service
institutions—institutions that are not paid for performance and results,
but for efforts and programs.</p>
<p>The Three Kinds of Service Institutions</p>
<ol start="12" type="a">
<li>There is first the natural monopoly. It does produce economic goods
and services, or at least it is supposed to; yet it cannot be paid for
out of results and performance precisely because it is a monopoly.</li>
</ol>
<p>The economist defines as natural monopoly those businesses which have
to have exclusive rights in a given area—the telephone service or the
electric power service. But the research laboratory within a business is
also a natural monopoly within its business.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The next group of service institutions are those that have to be
paid for out of a budget allocation. While they share a common
character, their individual purpose and the specific way in which they
try to accomplish it need not be uniform; and the priorities can—and
indeed often should—be quite diverse.</li>
</ol>
<p>The American university is one example. Each of the six university
presidents in our case history was concern with higher education. Each
was out to build a university on the ruins of the old, decayed
eighteenth-century denominational academy. They all saw alternative
missions and functions. Each tried to structure his university so as to
give different emphasis among these alternatives of “what our business
is or should be,” and each set different priorities. They knowingly and
deliberately, built competing institutions though all were universities
and had the same structure: trustees, an administration, faculty and
students, and similar courses leading to the same degrees.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Finally, there are those service institutions in which means are as
important as ends, and in which, therefore, uniformity is of the
essence. Here belongs the administration of justice or defense and most
of the areas which, in traditional political philosophy, were considered
policy areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Institutions’ Specific Needs</p>
<p>What does each of these institutions need?</p>
<p>The natural monopoly needs the least structure. It is closest to
results even though not directly being paid for them. All it needs, in
other words, is to do what any business should be doing anyhow, but to
do it far more systematically.</p>
<p>This, incidentally, is a strong argument in favor of keeping natural
monopolies under public regulation rather than under public ownership.
An unregulated natural monopoly,</p>
<p>as economists and political scientists learned long ago, will
inevitably exploit, in addition to being ineffective and inefficient. A
government-owned monopoly may not exploit, but the customer has no
redress against inefficiency, poor service, high rates, and general
disregard of his needs. An independently managed monopoly under public
regulation is likely to be far more responsive to customer
dissatisfactions and consumer needs than either the unregulated private
or the government-owned monopoly. The regulated but independently
managed monopoly depends on public opinion, expressed to and through a
political agency, the regulatory body, for its rates and, therefore, for
its revenues and profits.</p>
<p>The French telephone customer knows perfectly well that he gets the
worst telephone service in any developed country (excepting only the
Soviet Union). Because telephone service is a government-owned monopoly,
he has no power and can only grumble. In the late sixties, the operating
efficiency of the American telephone system declined in some areas,
notably New York City, and waiting periods for service or for repair
became longer (a result, largely, of inattention to demographics in the
Telephone Company’s plans); customers could and did take effective
action. They began immediately to oppose requests from the telephone
company for rate increases—and a more effective means of disciplining a
monopoly is hard to imagine.</p>
<p>The American customers, however, are like the French in respect to
the postal service, where rates have been rising steeply for forty
years, and services have been deteriorating even faster. Since the
postal service is government-owned, we have no redress.</p>
<p>In addition, the regulatory agency through which a government body
deals with a private company on an arm’s-length basis can provide the
means for building into the structure of regulated monopolies the
systematic performance of the job Theodore Vail built in sixty years ago
for the American Telephone Company. Both the Federal Communications
Commission in its study of the long-lines (that is, long-distance)
service of the Bell System and the Federal Power Commission in its study
of electric-power supply in the midAtlantic states have moved toward
demanding such self-discipline from the various companies.</p>
<p>With respect to the monopoly which the research laboratory represents
within a business, top management can and should demand the discipline
of thinking through objectives, setting goals and priorities, measuring
performance, and sloughing off the unproductive. This is the only way to
make the research laboratory productive, responsive to the company’s
needs, opportunities, and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Management should also demand that goals of contribution be spelled
out and results be appraised against them. This need not be
quantitative—indeed, it often cannot be quantified. Still, the goals
should be specific and the appraisal rigorous.</p>
<p>One of the most effective research managers—himself a scientist of
world renown— makes it his practice to ask, “What have you in this
research lab contributed to the company’s vision, knowledge, and results
during the last three to five years?” And then he asks, “And what do you
expect to contribute to the company’s vision, knowledge, and results
during the next five years?” He reports that he never gets an answer the
first time he asks the question. All he gets are speeches on the
“intangibility” of research and its beatitudes. After asking the
question for a few years more, he begins to get answers; and a few years
later he even gets research results.</p>
<p>“Socialist Competition” in the Service Sector</p>
<p>The second kind of service institution is exemplified by school and
university, and also by the hospital. Most of the service staffs within
business organizations belong here too. What they need is Lange’s
socialist competition.</p>
<p>The “customer” of this kind of service institution is not really a
customer; he is a tributary. He pays for the service institution whether
he wants to or not, out of taxes, levies such as compulsory insurance,
or overhead allocations. The products of these institutions are not
meant to supply a want. They are meant to supply a need. School and
hospi-</p>
<p>tal, but also the typical service staff in business, supply what
everybody should have, ought to have, must have, because it is “good for
him,” or good for society.</p>
<p>This kind of service institution is normative, to use the logician’s
term. It aims at making its “customers” be something, do something,
behave in a certain way, know certain things, or believe in certain
things. Most of the service institutions of this second kind also
provide a public good which could not be furnished—often not even at the
most prohibitive cost—except on a collective basis. Both because they
are normative and because they supply a public good, they can be
financed only out of taxes, overhead allocation, or other compulsory
levies.</p>
<p>The service institutions of this second kind are the typical service
institutions of a developed society and are its institutional hallmark.
Monopolies and institutions of government—the service institutions of
the first and third categories—dominate undeveloped societies. But the
service institution of the second category becomes central in the
process of economic and social development. Its performance is crucial
to modern developed society. And in developed societies—or developed
businesses—it is this service institution that most closely touches the
daily life of the citizen—or of the manager.</p>
<p>Our rhetoric talks of the “right of every child to an education.” The
young people, however, complain about the compulsion to go to
school—they are more nearly right than the traditional rhetoric. We talk
of the “right of every citizen to decent health care.” In the United
States this is still, in part, an unfulfilled promise. Yet we are
already well on the way toward compulsory health care. In many
companies, for instance, executives are required to have an annual
physical checkup or else they lose their vacation or are not paid.</p>
<p>If and when the focus shifts to preventive medicine for large numbers
of people, as is likely to happen within a fairly short period, we will
soon demand of everybody that he avail himself of healthcare facilities.
In other words, we will make health care compulsory.</p>
<p>Compulsory utilization of the service staff is prescribed in a good
many businesses.</p>
<p>The marketing managers in the divisions of a decentralized company
are not asked, as a rule, whether they want to attend the marketing
seminars put on by the central marketing staff. They are told to
come.</p>
<p>The objective—the overall mission—must be general for this kind of
service institution. There should be minimum standards of performance
and results. But for the sake of performance, it is highly desirable,
particularly for public-owned institutions, that they should have
managerial autonomy and not be run by government even if they are
supervised and regulated by it.* Also, there should be a fair amount of
consumer choice between different ways of accomplishing the basic
mission, between different priorities and different methods. There
should be enough competition for these institutions to hold themselves
to performance standards.</p>
<p>We talk today in the U.S. about a voucher system for elementary and
high school education under which the government would pay to whatever
accredited school the child attends an amount equal to the cost of
teaching a child in the public schools. No matter how much latitude
schools would be given under such a voucher plan, surely none will,
however, be considered qualified under it unless it promises to give its
pupils a modicum of proficiency in basic skills such as reading,
writing, and figuring. We may leave it up to the school what method it
uses—there is room for experimentation, from the strictest traditional
school discipline to the behavioral manipulation of the English “open
school” or to “free-form” methods of education. But, fundamental goals
and minimum standards will, and should be, insisted upon. Similarly,
schools teaching, say, urban guerrilla warfare in Black neighborhoods
are unlikely to stay long on the approved list—and should</p>
<p>*In an earlier book, The Age of Discontinuity, I called this
“re-privatization” for want of a better term. This, however, has been
widely misunderstood as meaning return to private ownership, which is
not at all what I had in mind (though I would not exclude it either).
What is important is the autonomy of the institution, its subjection to
performance tests and to some form of competition, albeit in many cases
“socialist competition.”</p>
<p>not. And there will be no choice as to whether a child of school age
goes to school or not—he goes, whether he and his parents like it or
not.</p>
<p>In health care, too, we may well move to a system that establishes
the principle that everyone is entitled to prepaid health care—paid for
either out of employees’ insurance or by government for the aged and the
poor. Yet we may well encourage considerable differentiation among
different plans, and considerable competition between different kinds of
health-care institutions with different plans and different priorities.
This is the approach of the oldest national health-care plan, that of
Germany.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the application of the same approach to the
service staff in a major business. One large multinational company,
primarily producing and selling branded consumer goods, defines its
business as “marketing.” With such a definition one would expect to find
a large marketing services staff in the company. But the staff is
remarkably small. There is a marketing vice-president in top
management—he is, in effect, the number two man in the company. But
marketing services do not report to him but to a director of marketing
services. The marketing services staff has a small budget that pays for
such activities as training the marketing services personnel, research
in the marketing field, the library, and so on, but not for marketing
services to the company’s businesses. Every one of the forty-five to
fifty decentralized and autonomously managed businesses of the company
located in more than thirty countries is held responsible for its
marketing performance and marketing results. To help his business reach
these results, the loca1 general manager may use the marketing services
staff but is under no compulsion to do so. He is entitled to use outside
consultants of his choice, or, if he so desires, he need not use any
marketing staff but be his own marketing consultant. Only if he does use
the marketing services staff does he pay for marketing services. The
marketing staff, however, audits the marketing standards and marketing
performance of every unit. When last heard of, eighteen or twenty of the
divisional and territorial managers of the company used the marketing
services staff. Eleven or twelve used outside consultants. Another dozen
did not use any service staff, whether inside or outside the company.
The marketing results of these men show no correlation to their methods.
Among the best and among the poorest performers are divisions which use
the company’s marketing staff, divisions which use outside consultants,
and divisions which do not use any marketing staff at all. Even the poor
performers in this company have remarkably high standards and good
marketing results. And the marketing services staff is among the best I
know, in its effectiveness, in its performance, and in its spirit and
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The Institutions of Governance</p>
<p>The third category of service institutions is, by and large, the
traditional government activities—the administration of justice and
defense and all the activities concerned with policy-making as the term
used to be understood. These institutions do not provide public goods in
the economist’s sense of the term; they provide governance.</p>
<p>Here managerial autonomy is not possible. Competition, if possible at
all, would be most undesirable. These institutions have to be under
direct government control and directly government-operated, yet their
activities require the discipline of objectives, priorities, and
measurement of results.</p>
<p>Such institutions require, therefore, an organized, independent audit
of their promises, the assumptions on which they base themselves, and
their performance. There is no way of building any feedback from results
into these institutions. The only disciplines, therefore, to which they
can be subjected are analysis and audit. The institution of the
auditorgeneral became accepted in government during the nineteenth
century (though it goes back to the France of Louis XIV, that is, the
late seventeenth century, and was established pretty much in its present
form as early as 1760 or so by Frederick the Great in Prussia). By now
it is commonplace for government to establish a separate agency,
independent of executive and legislative branches, which audits
expenditures and exposes to public notice dishonesty, irregularity, and
gross inefficiency.</p>
<p>Now that service institutions have become so central, so important,
and so costly; we need an auditor-general of objectives and performance.
We need to force ourselves to look at proposed government policies,
laws, and programs—but also at the policies, programs, and activities of
service staffs—and ask, “Are the objectives realistic? Are they
attainable or pure rhetoric? Do they relate appropriately to the needs
they are supposed to satisfy? Have the right targets been set? Have
priorities been thought through? And, do results relate to promises and
expectations?”</p>
<p>The American government may have begun to realize the need. This
explains the recent change of name from Bureau of the Budget to Office
of Management and Budget. But this new organ is still an agency of the
president and located in his executive office. To produce results it
will have to be independent. It will also need the right and the duty to
monitor proposed legislation, that is, audit the legislature, as it is
now supposed to monitor the execution of programs that have already been
adopted. So far the office of Management and Budget is mostly promise,
but at least it has now been recognized that making the service
institutions of the federal government perform requires organized review
of objectives and performance and organized abandonment of
yesterday.</p>
<p>We need to go further and accept as a basic premise that every
governmental agency and every act of the legislature be conceived as
impermanent. A new activity, a new agency, a new program should be
enacted for a limited time, to be extended only when results prove the
soundness of the objective and of the means chosen. This may sound
utopian—and in government it may still be. Outside of government, in
other service institutions—including those that should be autonomous
even though public (e.g., school or hospital)—this will have to come to
pass. Society is becoming too dissatisfied with the lack of performance
and results of service institutions to tolerate the traditional system
forever.</p>
<p>Failure to abolish nonperforming programs accounts for many of our
worst problems.</p>
<p>It underlies the failure of the U.S. and the Common Market farm
programs; it underlies the “welfare mess” that threatens to destroy our
cities; it underlies the failure of our international development
programs which threatens to bring about worldwide race war of poor
nonwhites against rich whites.</p>
<p>Failure to feed back from results may well, tomorrow, endanger the
environment and our efforts to save it. Results are badly needed. But so
far we have neither faced up to the need to think through what we are
after nor set priorities; nor have we organized a feedback from results
on the direction, the priorities, and the efforts of the environmental
crusade. Predictably, this can only mean no results, and rapid
disenchantment.</p>
<p>What the service institutions need is not to be more businesslike.
They need to be subjected to performance tests—if only to that of
“socialist competition”—as much as possible. But they need to be more
hospital-like, university-like, government-like, and so on. In other
words, they need to think through their own specific functions,
purposes, and missions.</p>
<p>What the service institutions need is not better people. They need
people who do the management job systematically and who focus themselves
and their institution purposefully on performance and results. They do
need efficiency, that is, control of costs, but above all they need
effectiveness, that is, emphasis on the right results.</p>
<p>Few service institutions today suffer from having too few
administrators; most of them are over-administered, and suffer from a
surplus of procedures, organization charts, and management techniques.
What now has to be learned is to manage service institutions for
performance. This may well be the biggest and most important management
task in this century.</p>
