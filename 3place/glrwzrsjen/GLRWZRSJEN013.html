<h4 id="the-multi-institutional-society">11 The Multi-Institutional
Society</h4>
<p>Service Institutions Society’s Growth Sector—Service Institutions
within Business— Society, Including Business, Depends on the Performance
of Service Institutions—Are Service Institutions Managed? —Are They
Manageable? —Performance and Results the Exceptions in Service
Institutions—The Importance of the Exceptions—Making the Service
Institution Perform as a Central Managerial Challenge</p>
<p>Business enterprise is only one of the institutions of modern
society, and business managers are by no means our only managers.
Service institutions—government agencies; armed services; schools and
universities; research laboratories; hospitals and other health-care
institutions; labor unions; professional practices such as the large law
firm or the large (and often multinational) accounting firm;
professional, industry, and trade associations, and many others—are
equally institutions and, therefore, equally in need of management. They
all have people who are designated to exercise the management function
and who are paid for doing the management job, even though they may not
be called managers, but administrators, commanders, directors,
executives, or some such title.</p>
<p>These public-service institutions—to give them a generic name—are the
real growth sector of a modern society.</p>
<p>It is not that business has become less powerful, less strong, or
less successful; the others, the service institutions, have
proportionately become more powerful, larger, and, above all, more
important than they were.</p>
<p>We have a multi-institutional society rather than a business society.
The traditional title of the American college courses still tends to
read “Business Government.” But this is an anachronism; it should read
“Business, Government, and Many Others.”</p>
<p>Service Institutions within Business</p>
<p>Within business enterprises, the growth sector has also been “service
institutions.” In every larger business—and many fairly small
businesses—there has been rapid increase in service groups and service
functions, such as staffs, research departments, planning groups,
coordinators, management information systems, and so on. All these are
service institutions rather than operating units. They have no direct
relationship to the economic performance and the results of the
business. While they operate within an economic institution, none of
them produces economic results directly or performs economically by
itself.</p>
<p>These service institutions within business also have managers, of
course. They also need to be managed for performance.</p>
<p>All service institutions are being paid for out of the economic
surplus produced by economic activity. They are overhead—either social
overhead or business overhead. The</p>
<p>growth of the service institutions in this century is thus the best
testimonial to the success of business in discharging its economic task,
i.e., producing economic surplus.</p>
<p>Yet—unlike the early nineteenth-century university—the service
institutions are not luxury or ornament. They are pillars of a modern
society, load-bearing members of the main structure. They have to
perform if society and business are to function. It is not only that
these service institutions are the main expense of a modern society; as
said earlier (Chapters 1 and 3) half of the gross national product of
the U.S. (and of most of the other developed countries) is spent on
public-service institutions. Every citizen in the developed,
industrialized, urbanized societies depends for his survival on the
performance of the public-service institutions. But these institutions
also embody the values of developed societies. Education, health care,
knowledge, and mobility—rather than primarily more food, clothing, and
shelter—are the fruits of our society’s increased economic capacities
and productivity.</p>
<p>The service institutions within business too are—or should
be—load-bearing members of the structure. It is not just their steadily
increasing cost that makes it mandatory for them to be managed for
contribution and performance. Business enterprise depends on the
performance of its service staffs, its planners, researchers,
information specialists, analysts, and accountants.</p>
<p>Yet the evidence for performance in the service institutions is not
impressive, let alone overwhelming. Schools, hospitals, and universities
are all big today beyond the imagination of an earlier generation. Their
budgets have grown even faster. Yet everywhere they are in crisis. A
generation or two ago their performance was taken for granted. Today
they are being attacked on all sides for lack of performance. Services
which the nineteenth century managed with aplomb and apparently with
little effort—the postal service, for instance, or the railroads—are
deeply in the red, require enormous and growing subsidies, and give
poorer service everywhere. Government agencies, both in national and in
local governments, are constantly being reorganized so as to be more
efficient. Yet in every country the citizen complains ever more loudly
of bureaucracy in government. What he means by this complaint is that
the government agency is being run for the convenience of its employees
rather than for contribution and performance. This is mismanagement.</p>
<p>The most persistent critics of bureaucracy in government and in the
public-service institutions tend to be business executives. But it is by
no means certain that business’s own service institutions are any more
effective than the public-service bureaucracies.</p>
<p>In the last twenty years, staff activities, planning departments,
coordinators, and management information systems have snowballed in all
large corporations. Judged by their ability to get their budgets funded,
they have been tremendous successes. Many also have truly impressive
functional knowledge, employ men of great ability and competence, and
are producing a rapidly growing literature. However, it is by no means
clear that many of them make a contribution. Worse still, I would not
know in most cases how to judge their performance or how to measure
their results—nor do they themselves.</p>
<p>As the service staffs have been growing, the whole staff concept has
come under increasing attack. The concept certainly does not perform as
its original designers fifty years ago expected it to work—any more than
the American government agency performs as the liberal enthusiasts of
government activism in the New Deal days of the thirties or the
intellectuals of the Kennedy Administration in the sixties expected it
to perform.</p>
<p>Research activities in business have grown perhaps even faster than
service staffs.</p>
<p>And so has government-sponsored research in the universities and in
separate research institutes. With respect to research, too,
disenchantment has set in. Far too many companies have little to show
except beautiful buildings for all the research money they spent. Worse
still, it is the rare research department that can answer the question,
“And what have you contributed?”—and uncommon to find a research
department that asks this question.</p>
<p>Are Service Institutions Managed</p>
<p>The service institutions themselves have become “management
conscious.” Service institutions increasingly turn to business to learn
management. In all service institutions, manager development, management
by objectives, and many other concepts and tools of business management
are now common.</p>
<p>This is a healthy sign but it does not mean that the service
institutions understand the problems of managing themselves. It only
means that they begin to realize that at present they are not being
managed.</p>
<p>But Are They Manageable?</p>
<p>There is another and very different response to the performance
crisis of the service institutions. A growing number of critics,
especially among the disenchanted liberals of yesterday, have come to
the conclusion that service institutions are inherently unmanageable and
incapable of performance.</p>
<p>The most radical expression of this conclusion is the demand to
de-school society, first voiced by the former priest Ivan Illich, and
most clearly presented by the teacher and educational critic John Holt.*
Schools, Illich and Holt agree, cannot perform and cannot be made to
perform. If only schools were abolished, children would learn.</p>
<p>This is, of course, another “noble savage” fantasy. Society was
“de-schooled” not so long ago—not much more than a century ago. We have
ample documents from this “preschool” era, e.g., the copious
investigations into the life and development of children in early
Victorian England, or in mid-nineteenth-century Germany. There is
precious little support in these documents for the belief that children
will become creative and learn by themselves if only they are not
subjected to the mismanagement of the school. Schools at all levels do
indeed need drastic changes. But what we need is not a “non-school,” but
a properly functioning and properly managed learning institution.†</p>
<p>There is no possibility that we can or will do away with the service
institutions. There is not the slightest evidence that today’s society
is willing to do without the contributions the service institutions are
created to provide. The very people who preach de-schooling society want
more rather than less education. The people who most vocally attack the
shortcomings of the hospitals want more and better health care. The
voters who are most bitter about government bureaucracy vote for more
government programs. Similarly, business is not going to do without the
contribution of knowledge, expertise, and systematic thinking which
service staffs and research departments are intended to furnish.</p>
<p>We have no choice but to learn to manage the service institutions for
performance.</p>
<p>And they can be managed for performance.</p>
<p>The Importance of the Exceptions</p>
<p>Performance in the service institution—whether public service or
service staff in business—is the exception rather than the rule. But
there are exceptions, and they prove that service institutions can
perform.</p>
<p>Several examples of performing service institutions will be discussed
in Chapter 13, “The Exceptions and Their Lessons,” but a few might be
mentioned here. Among American government agencies of the last forty
years, two performers stand out: the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA),
the big regional electric-power and irrigation project in the
Southeastern United States (especially during its early years, in the
thirties and forties, when it was headed by David Lilienthal), and in
the sixties, the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA), which
managed the American space program. Among universities attempting mass
higher education some of the new English “red brick” universities (e.g.,
the University of Bradford, especially in engineering and management
education)</p>
<p>*John Holt, Freedom and Beyond (Dutton, 1972).</p>
<p>†On this see my article “What We Already Know About Tomorrow’s
School,” in Psychology Today, June, 1972.</p>
<p>have been notably effective. While a great many—perhaps most-schools
in the inner-city, Black ghettos of America deserve all the strictures
of the de-schooling movement, a few schools in the very worst ghettos
(e.g., in New York’s South Bronx) have shown high capacity to make the
most disadvantaged children acquire the basic skills of literacy.</p>
<p>What then is it that inhibits the typical service institution from
performing? And what is it that the few performing service institutions
do—or eschew—that makes them capable of performance? These are the
questions to ask, and they are management questions.</p>
<p>Managing the service institutions for performance will increasingly
be seen as the central managerial challenge of a developed society, and
as its greatest managerial need.</p>
<p>The service institution does not differ much from a business
enterprise in any area other than its specific mission. It faces very
similar—if not the same—challenges to make work productive and the
workers achieving. It does not differ significantly from a business in
its social responsibility.</p>
<p>The term social responsibility used to be reserved for the
relationship between business and its social environment. Indeed, the
original term read “the social responsibilities of business.” Recent
events have shown that the service institutions face the same problems
in their relationship with the environment and with society, whether
they be university, government agency, school, or hospital. The worst
polluters today are, after all, governments—local governments with
inadequate sewer plants. That will be discussed later in this book (in
the section titled “Social Impacts and Social Responsibilities”) applies
with little modification to all institutions, public or private.</p>
<p>Nor does the service institution differ very much from business
enterprise with respect to the manager’s work and job, organization
design and structure, or even the job and structure of top management.
Internally the differences tend to be differences in terminology rather
than in substance.</p>
<p>But the service institution is different fundamentally from business
in its “business.” It is different in its purpose. It has different
values. It needs different objectives, and it makes a different
contribution to society. Performance and results are quite different in
a service institution from what they are in a business. Managing for
performance is the one area in which the service institution differs
significantly from a business.</p>
<p>We have no coherent theory of institutions and their management that
would encompass the service institution. Compared to the work done in
business management over the last seventy years, little has been done on
the management of the service institution. All we can attempt so far is
a first sketch.</p>
<p>We do understand why the service institution has difficulty
performing. And we can define what is needed to offset the built-in
obstacles in the service institution to performance and results.</p>
