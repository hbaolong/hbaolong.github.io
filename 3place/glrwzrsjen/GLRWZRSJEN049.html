<p>The Systems Structure</p>
<p>NASA—The Japanese Systems Designs and the “Multinational”—Diversity
of Cul- tures and Values—The Difficulties of the Systems Structure—Its
Requirements—Its Importance</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>F THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES OF ORGANIZATION, only one, Fayol’s functions,
can be said to have started in a theoretical analysis. The others—the
team, federal decentralization, and simulated decentralization—grew out
of ad hoc responses to specific challenges and needs of the moment. This
applies also to the systems structure. It was developed as a design
principle for one apparently unique management problem: that of the
American space effort in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Systems organization is an extension of the team design principle.
But instead of indi- viduals comprising a team, the systems organization
builds the team out of a wide variety of different organizations. They
may be government agencies and any number of private businesses, large
and small; universities and individual researchers; organizations that
are part of the central organization charged with the task and directly
controlled by it, others who may be wholly or partly owned by it but run
autonomously, and yet others which stand only in a contractual
relationship to the parent organization and are in no way con- trolled
by it or even controllable. Systems design uses all the other design
principles as the task demands: functional organizations and teams,
federal and simulated decentraliza- tion.</p>
<p>Some of the members of the systems structure may have a specific task
which does not change throughout the entire life of the venture. Others
may have various tasks according to the stage of the program. Some will
be permanent members. Others may be brought in only for one specific
assignment, after which they sever their relationship with the sys- tems
structure.</p>
<p>The “model” which first made the systems structure visible as a
principle of organiza- tion design was the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) in its or- ganization of the U.S. space
program in the 1960s.* But while our awareness of the exis- tence of
such a structure is fairly recent, it has been in existence a long time.
While the large systems structure emerged as a design principle in a
huge governmental program, it actually was first developed as a
structure for businesses; and major future application is probably in
business.</p>
<p>Though Sayles and Chandler may not have realized it, their book on
NASA describes a system used in Japan for a century. The Japanese large
company and its suppliers and</p>
<p>*And the only description of systems management we have so far are
studies of NASA: James E. Webb (NASA Administrator from 1961 to 1968),
Space Age Management (McGraw-Hill, 1968) and, especially, Leonard R.
Sayles and Margaret K. Chandler, Managing Large Systems (Harper
andandandand Row, 1971).</p>
<p>distributors work in a very similar relationship to that in which
NASA worked with its suppliers, subcontractors, and partners. The
Japanese large company sometimes owns its suppliers. More often it has
little or no ownership stake in them. Yet the suppliers are integrated
into the “system.” Similarly, the Japanese large company usually depends
upon a trading company which is both independent and integrated. The
relationships among the large companies which constitute one industrial
group (Zaibatsu) are also comparable to the relationships which NASA
developed for its own needs.</p>
<p>It is becoming clear that something very much like the systems
structure will have to be developed for the multinational corporation.
Indeed, many of the approaches worked out for the multinational
corporation are truly (though not consciously) systems manage- ment
concepts. And the typical problems of the multinational corporation are
also the typical problems of a systems structure.</p>
<p>One example is the structure the Chase Manhattan Bank has developed
for its world- wide banking system. In contrast to the traditional
approach, Chase decided not to rely exclusively or even primarily on
wholly-owned branches abroad. Instead, it has been ex- panding worldwide
through acquiring minority interests in well-established, medium- sized,
local hanks. These banks are not owned or controlled by the Chase. Nor
is the top management usually furnished by the Chase. But they are part
of the “Chase system.” They are integrated into the worldwide banking
facilities and services of the bank while, at the same time, they keep
strong local roots in their own community. They are both in- dependent
and integrated.</p>
<p>Another example is the multinational advertising agency. The
headquarters of the firm may be in New York, and the branches in England
or Germany may be wholly owned subsidiaries. The structure may look, at
first glance, like federal decentralization. But the needs of
multinational clients demand that these federal autonomous businesses
work together in a systems relationship. To service a client whose
headquarters is outside of the United States—Unilever in London and
Rotterdam, for instance, Nestle in Switzerland, or Sony in Tokyo—the
overall responsibility for the account has to be lodged where the cli-
ent is, that is, in England, Switzerland, or Japan. Yet there have to be
relationships with every one of the subsidiaries of the clients wherever
they might be. There is need, there- fore, for a network of local
account executives who work out of a local autonomous de- centralized
business and yet work closely together. All the worldwide facilities of
the ad- vertising agencies, whether market research, media research, or
media buying, have to be available to these account executives, wherever
the experts are. While an advertising campaign may be worldwide, it has
to be adapted in every single country to the products the multinational
client produces and markets in the country, to the specific needs and
demands of the local market, to local habits, tastes, and consumer
preferences, and to the media available in each marker and effective in
it. And a worldwide accounting prac- tice—legally one huge multinational
partnership—is also a true systems structure.</p>
<p>What all these organizations have in common is the need to integrate
diversity of cul- tures and values into unity of action. Each of the
components of the system has to work in its own way, be effective
according to its own logic and according to its own accepted norm of
behavior. Or else it will not be effective at all. Yet all components
have to work toward a common goal. Each has to accept, understand, and
carry out its own role. This can be achieved only by direct, flexible,
and tailor-made relationships among people or groups of people in which
personal bond and mutual trust bridge wide differences in ways of
behavior, point of view, and in what is considered “proper” and
“appropriate.”</p>
<p>NASA, for instance, faced the problem of the divergent values and
cultures of a large government agency some major units of which were
organized by, and heavily staffed with, men used to the ways of U.S.
military services while others were built and run by German-born and
German-trained space scientists like Wernher von Braun in the tradition
of the German Herr Professor with his helpers and assistants.
Businesses, some very large (e.g., Pan American Airways), some quite
small, were “partners” on the “team” rather than “subcontractors.” They
did not make and deliver a part to preset specifications but planned,
designed, and operated the “nervous systems” of the entire space effort,
e.g., the</p>
<p>huge launch complex at Cape Kennedy. Other “team members” were
individual university scientists working by themselves in their own
laboratories.</p>
<p>That the multinational faces similar problems of cultural and value
diversity needs lit- tle explanation. (See also Chapter 59.) But to talk
of the large Japanese company as “mul- ticultural” may at first glance
seem surprising. But Japan has had—and in large measure still has—what
the Japanese call the “double economy”: the “pre-modern” economy of
(mostly small) workshops and of wholesalers and retailers, and a
“modern” economy of (mostly large) manufacturing, banking, and marketing
businesses. They represent very different structures, are organized and
run quite differently, and define objectives and performance quite
differently. The systems design has enabled Japan to maintain those two
economies in parallel and in partnership for a century and to avoid—or
at least to cushion—the disruption of traditional society by
“modernization” which has occurred in every other non-Western country.
And there has been a second “cultural” problem for the large, modern
Japanese business: its relationship with and integration into the
interna- tional economy and business world, as a source of supply of
materials, machinery, and technology; as a market; and as an investor
and partner. Both the trading company and the “joint venture” are
cultural bridges, and systems design.</p>
<p>The Difficulties and Problems of the Systems Structures</p>
<p>Systems design is a very, poor “fit” with respect to all design
specifications. It lacks clar- ity. It lacks stability. People neither
find it easy to know what their job is, nor to under- stand the job of
the whole and their relationship to it. Communications are a continuing
problem, and one not capable of lasting solution. It is never clear
where a certain decision should he made, nor indeed what the basic
decisions are. Flexibility is great and receptiv- ity to new ideas is
almost too great. Yet the structure does not, as a rule, develop people
and test them for top-management positions. Above all, the systems
structure violates the principle of internal economy.</p>
<p>When NASA first started. the scientists who dominated it then
believed that controls, and especially, of course, computer-based
information, would run the system. They were soon disabused. One
constant theme of the Sayles-Chandler book is the crucial impor- tance
of face-to-face personal relationships, of constant meetings, and of
bringing people into the decision-making process, even on matters that
are remote from their own assign- ments. The key executives at NASA
spent something like two-thirds of their time in meet- ings, and mostly
in meetings on matters that, at first sight, were not directly related
to their own tasks.</p>
<p>Personal relationships are the only thing that prevents breakdown in
the systems struc- ture. There is constant need for arbitration of
conflicts between various members of the system for adjudication of
disputes or jurisdiction, on direction, on budgets, on people, on
priorities, and so on. The most important people, regardless of their
job descriptions or assigned tasks, spend most of their time keeping the
machinery running. In no other or- ganizational structure is the ratio
between output and effort needed for internal cohesion as unfavorable as
in the systems structure.</p>
<p>At the same time, the requirements for the systems structure to work
at all are exceed- ingly stringent. It demands absolute clarity of
objectives. The objectives themselves may well change, and change
rapidly. But at any one time they must be clear. And the objec- tive for
the work of each of the members of the system must be derived from the
objective of the whole and directly related to it. In other words, the
systems structure can function only if the job of thinking through “what
is our business and what should it be” is taken seriously and performed
with excellence. And then it requires that operational objectives and
strategy be developed with great care from the basic mission and
purpose.</p>
<p>“Get a man on the moon by 1970” is the kind of clear objective which
enables a sys- tems structure to work. But so was “Build an economically
strong Japan.” The multina- tional still has to develop objectives that
enable each of its constituent units to direct its</p>
<p>behavior toward some such a common goal—which is one of the main
problems of the multinational corporation.</p>
<p>Another requirement is a demand for universal communications
responsibility. Every member of the systems structure, but especially
every member of every one of the manag- ing groups, has to make sure
that mission, objective, and strategies are fully understood by
everyone, and that the doubts, questions, and ideas of every member are
heard, lis- tened to, respected, thought through, understood, and
resolved. This is how Sayles and Chandler phrased it:</p>
<p>One conclusion is clear: the communications requirements in these
projects [i.e., NASA] are overwhelming compared to those of more
traditional manufacturing processes. The impact of a newly identified
problem or discovery, or the search for the source of an unexplained
difficulty demands that a number of people in a variety of organizations
be involved almost simultaneously.*</p>
<p>The one multinational manufacturing business that has tackled the
problem reports ex- actly the same extreme emphasis on constant
communications.</p>
<p>The reorganization of Philips of Holland (discussed in the preceding
chapter) was based on federal decentralization. But because of the
diversity of Philips in geography, in technologies, and in products, top
management is largely a “system” of interlocking teams—a ten-man board
of management, thirteen worldwide product groups, and top- management
groups in up to sixty countries. And “management” at Philips means
nonstop communication, consultation, negotiation. Most of the key people
throughout Philips are Dutchmen who have come up in the company; yet the
diversity of their specific concerns, assignments, and environments
creates so much cultural diversity that only constant rela- tionships
can establish common vision, common effort, and effective decision.</p>
<p>A third requirement is that each member of the team, i.e.. each
managerial unit, take responsibility far beyond its own assignment. Each
member must, in effect, take top- management responsibility. To get any
results requires, from each member, a “high order of responsible
autonomy and the opportunity to innovate and even to change plans.”† At
the same time, each member must take efforts to know what goes on
throughout the entire system.</p>
<p>More than anything else the executives within a large-scale endeavor
must be able, one by one, and altogether, to see and to understand the
totality of the job that the end result was designed to do. Each must
see and understand the relationship of his evolving and changing
individual assignment, and of the functions and people involved in that
assignment, to the whole job and its requirement. This requires more
than knowing his place and his responsibility within the organization
itself, or knowing the organization “upside down.” It requires an
awareness between the total job as he sees it at the time, and his own
particular job within the total framework, including the elements of the
environment that are so much a part of the total.‡</p>
<p>No wonder that the systems structure has not, on the whole, been an
unqualified suc- cess. For every NASA with a successful moon shot (but
also with an almost unlimited budget to support it) dozens of systems
structures have failed miserably to perform or have done so only through
budgetary irresponsibility, such as no private business could survive
(e.g., the Concorde and various “weapons systems,” in Europe as well as
in the U.S.). The attempt to use systems management to tackle major
social problems—the much-touted promise of the sixties—is almost certain
to be a total failure. Social and po-</p>

<p>†Sayles and Chandler, op. cit., p. 6.</p>
<p>‡James E. Webb, Space Age Management, pp. 135-137.</p>
<p>litical complexities that are encountered whenever we move from outer
space (where, after all, there are no voters) into the inner city and
its problems, into economic develop- ment, or even into something
seemingly so purely technical as mass transit, are almost certain to
overwhelm the precarious cohesion of a systems structure.</p>
<p>And yet the Japanese have been running complex and large systems
structures for a century. They have not avoided the difficulties nor
found a way around them. Indeed all the obvious inefficiencies of the
Japanese system—the fact, for instance, that top- management people
spend endless time in meetings and in building personal relationships
and communications—are, we now understand, built-in characteristics of
the systems structure. But the Japanese experience also shows that the
system can be made to work and can indeed be highly productive.</p>
<p>It needs, however, clear goals, high self-discipline throughout the
structure, and a top management that takes personal responsibility for
relationships and communications.</p>
<p>For the majority of managers, the systems structure is not of direct
personal concern— though any manager in a multinational business will
have to learn to understand it if he wants to function effectively
himself. The systems structure will never be a preferred form of
organization; it is fiendishly difficult. But it is an important
structure, and one that the organization designer needs to know and
needs to understand—if only to know that it should not be used where
other, simpler and easier structures will do the job.</p>
