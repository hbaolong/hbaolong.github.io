<h4 id="what-makes-a-manager">30 What Makes a Manager?</h4>
<p>The Traditional Definition—Its Inadequacy—Manager and Member of
Manage- ment—The Career Professional—Defining a Manager by Function
Rather Than Power—Title, Function, and Pay of the Career
Professional</p>
<pre><code>HAT CHARACTERIZES A MANAGER? “manager” and “management” are slippery,</code></pre>
<p>And what defines him? The words to say the least. They are
untranslat-</p>
<p>able into any other language. In British English they do not have the
meaning they have in the United States. And even in American usage,
their meaning is far from clear.</p>
<p>The word “manager” has no exact counterpart in German, French,
Spanish, Italian, or Russian; yet the words used in these languages are
as imprecise and elusive as “manager” is in American. Most people, when
asked what they mean by “manager,” will reply “a boss.” But when the
sign over the shoeshine stand in an airport reads “John Smith, Man-
ager,” everybody (at least in America) knows that this means that
Mr. Smith is not the boss, i.e., not the proprietor, but a hired hand
with a minimum of authority and a salary just above that of the workers
who shine the shoes.</p>
<p>Early in the history of management a manager was defined as someone
who “is re- sponsible for the work of other people.” This served a
useful purpose at the time. It dis- tinguished the manager’s function
from that of the “owner.” It made clear that managing was a specific
kind of work which could be analyzed, studied, and improved systemati-
cally. The definition focused on the essentially new, large and
permanent organization emerging to perform the economic tasks of
society.</p>
<p>Yet, the definition is not at all satisfactory. In fact, it never
was. From the beginning, there were people in the enterprise, often in
responsible positions, who were clearly man- agement and yet did not
manage, that is, who were not responsible for the work of other people.
The treasurer of a company, the man responsible for the supply and use
of money in the business, may have subordinates and in that sense be a
manager in terms of the tra- ditional definition. But clearly, the
treasurer himself does most of the treasurer’s job. He works with the
company’s underwriters, with the financial community, and so on. He is
an “individual contributor,” rather than a manager. But he is a member
of top management.</p>
<p>Also, the definition focuses on the tools for a task rather than on
the task itself. The man in charge of market research in a company may
have a large number of people re- porting to him and is thus a manager
in the traditional sense. But it really makes no differ- ence to his
function and contribution whether he has a large staff, a small staff,
or no staff at all. The same contribution in terms of market research
and market analysis can well be made by a man to whom no one reports. He
may even make a greater contribution when he is not forced to spend a
great deal of his time with subordinates and on their work. He thus may
make market research more effective in the business, better understood
by his associates in management, and more firmly built into the
company’s basic business deci- sions and into its definition of what
“our business is and should be.”</p>
<p>In line with the traditional definition of a manager as a man who “is
responsible for the work of others” we should talk of a “manager of
market researchers.” Instead, we al- ways talk of a “manager of market
research.” This common usage is right in its intuitive understanding of
what the responsibility of the managerial position is and should be, and
how the incumbent should be measured.</p>
<p>The traditional definition has become increasingly inappropriate and
a bar to effective management, effective organization, and true
performance.</p>
<p>The most rapidly growing group in any organization, especially in
today’s business enterprise, are people who are management, in the sense
of being responsible for contri- bution to and results of the
enterprise.* However, they are clearly not managers in that they are
not, as a rule, the bosses and responsible for the work of other people.
The most rapidly growing group in business enterprise today are
individual professional contribu- tors of all kinds who work by
themselves (perhaps with an assistant and a secretary) and yet have
impact on the company’s wealth-producing capacity, the direction of its
busi- ness, and its performance.</p>
<p>Such people are not to be found only in technical research work,
though it was here that they first emerged as a distinct group. The
senior chemist in the laboratory has major responsibility and makes
major decisions, many of them irreversible in their impact. But so also
does the man who works out and thinks through the company’s organization
and designs managerial jobs, whether his title be organization planner
or director of manage- ment development. Here also belongs the senior
cost accountant who determines the defi- nition and allocation of costs.
By defining the measurements for management, he, in ef- fect, largely
decides whether a certain product will be kept or will be abandoned.
Other people in the same category are the man charged with the
development and maintenance of quality standards for a company’s
products, the man working on the distributive system through which the
company’s products are being brought to the market, and the advertis-
ing director, who may be responsible for the basic promotion policy of a
company, its advertising message, the media it uses, and the
measurements of advertising effectiveness.</p>
<p>The traditional definition is responsible, in large measure, for the
fact that the individ- ual professional contributor presents a problem
within the structure and a problem to him- self. His title, his pay, his
function, and his career opportunities are confused, ambiguous, and a
cause of dissatisfaction and friction. Yet the number of these career
professionals is increasing fast.</p>
<p>There needs to be greater flexibility in assigning people within the
management group—to task forces, teams, and other organizational units
which do not fit the tradi- tional concept of a “line organization,”
that is, an organization in which one member is the boss, while the
others are subordinates.†</p>
<p>Managers in the traditional sense will have to be able to move into
situations where they are not superiors, indeed, into situations where
they are the “juniors” to non- managers on a team or a task force.
Conversely, career professionals without managerial function or title in
the traditional sense will have to be able to be team leaders or task
force leaders. The traditional separation between managers and
non-managers will in- creasingly become a hindrance and
inappropriate.</p>
<p>The New Definition of a Manager</p>
<p>It is necessary and urgent, that we think through what really defines
a manager and who should be considered management.</p>
<p>The first attempt at solving the problem, made in the early 1950s,
supplemented the definition of the manager with a new definition of an
“individual professional contribu-</p>
<p>*On this see especially Chapter 35.</p>
<p>†On the team as organizational design see Chapter 45.</p>
<p>tor”* with “parallel paths of opportunity” for both. This made it
possible to pay a man properly for “professional” work rather than make
higher pay dependent upon promotion into a “manager’s” job, that is,
into a position of responsibility for the work of others.</p>
<p>Yet this formula has not fully solved the problem. The companies that
have adopted it report that the individual professional contributor is
only slightly less dissatisfied than he was before. He remains convinced
that true opportunities for advancement still exist only, or at least
primarily, within the administrative structure, and that one has to
become a “boss” to “get ahead.” Above all, the separation of the
managerial world into two groups serves to emphasize the inferiority of
those who do their own work as compared with those responsible for the
work of others. The emphasis is still on power and authority rather than
on responsibility and contribution.</p>
<p>Outside of the U.S. the problem may be even worse. In Japan there are
no career op- portunities at all for the individual contributor.
Seniority forces a Japanese to become an administrator—as a result of
which, for instance, the ablest newspapermen are forced to stop writing
and the ablest scientists in the research labs to become “research
managers” and to stop researching.</p>
<p>Any analysis which does not start out from the traditional definition
but looks at the work itself will come to the conclusion that the
traditional definition of a manager as one responsible for the work of
others emphasizes a secondary; rather than a primary, charac-
teristic.</p>
<p>As we will see (in the next chapter), one can define the work of a
manager as plan- ning, organizing, integrating, and measuring. The
career professional—e.g., a market re- searcher who works by himself, or
a senior cost accountant—also has to plan, to organize, and to measure
his results against his objectives and expectations. He also has to
integrate his work with the work of other people in the organization. He
has to integrate his work into that of the unit of which he is a part.
Above all, if he is to have results, he has to inte- grate “sideways,”
that is, with the people in other areas and functions who have to put
his work to use.</p>
<p>Similarly, the “manager” has to integrate “downwards,” that is, with
the work of the people who report to him—which is what the traditional
definition stresses. The most important relation areas in which he has
to integrate the work of his unit, if it is to have any results, cut
again sideways—that is, with people over whom he has no managerial
control.</p>
<p>The essence of the first-line supervisor’s job in the plant or office
is the management of the people who report to him. Upward or sideways
relations are secondary on that level. Yet common usage does not
consider the first-line supervisor a manager. We speak of the supervisor
as a “member of management,” implying that he should be a manager but
really is not, or only marginally so. The reason is, of course, that the
first-line supervi- sor, whether in the factory or in the office, is not
commonly expected to take much re- sponsibility for his contribution and
results. He is expected to deliver aceording to objec- tives set for him
by others—in the typical mass-production plant this is all he possibly
can or should do. This makes the supervisor’s job ambiguous and
difficult.† But the fact that we are reluctant to call the supervisor a
manager, even though his job fits the traditional definition better than
the jobs of people who hold higher and much more important posi- tions
in the executive hierarchy, only demonstrates that the definition
accentuates the sec- ondary, rather than the primary.</p>
<p>It would, therefore, seem appropriate to stress that the first
criterion in identifying those people within an organization who have
management responsibility is not command over people. It is
responsibility for contribution. Function rather than power has to be
the distinctive criterion and the organizing principle.</p>
<p>*The pioneer in this effort was the General Electric Company
especially its former vice-president— management services, Harold F.
Smiddy, who realized the central importance of this problem and made the
first attempts at solving it.</p>
<p>†See Chapter 21.</p>
<p>But what should these people be called? Many organizations have
experimented with new definitions or have tried to give old terms a new
meaning.* Perhaps the best thing is not to coin a new term, but to
follow popular usage which speaks of the “management group.” Within the
management group, there will be people whose function includes the
traditional managerial function, responsibility for the work of others.
There will be others who do not carry this responsibility within their
specific assignment. And there will be a third group which is somewhat
ambiguous and in-between, people whose job is that of team leader or
task force captain, or people who combine both the function of advisor
to top management and the “conscience” of a business in a certain area,
with supervisory and administrative responsibility over a staff in a
given area. This is not a neat, let alone a perfect, solution. In every
organization there are people who are true specialists and who, while
anything but rank-and-file workers, do not see themselves as past of
management either. They want to remain specialists and are not,
fundamentally, much concerned with the whole of which they are a part.
Their allegiance is to their technical or professional skill, rather
than to their organization. The psychologist within a personnel
department sees himself as a professional—that is, a member of the world
of his academic specialty— rather than as an executive of this or that
company (or even as a faculty member of this or that university). And so
does the computer specialist.</p>
<p>Conversely, in many traditions other than the American, there are
people who fully accept the responsibility for their contribution but
are not deemed managers, or part of management, even though they may be
responsible for the work of others. An example is the German Meister,
the highly skilled worker who has risen to leadership within his craft,
who is in most cases the true “boss” within his craft area, and who yet
considers himself a skilled worker rather than a manager. He
corresponds, in many ways, to the noncommis- sioned officer in the
military, the long-serving master sergeant, for instance, who within his
own area, e.g., supply, is the real “boss,” but who will never become an
officer and does not expect to be one.</p>
<p>Yet though fuzzy, to define the management group by function and
responsibility en- ables us to work out the relationship between the
manager and the career professional.</p>
<p>The Career Professional</p>
<p>The career professional—and particularly the specialist—needs a
manager. His major problem is the relation of his area of knowledge and
expertise to the performance and results of the entire organization. The
career professional therefore has a major problem of communication. He
cannot be effective unless his output becomes the input of other people.
But his output is ideas and information. This requires that the users of
his output understand what he is trying to say and to do. But, by the
nature of his task, he will be tempted to use his own specialized
jargon. Indeed, in many cases, this is the only lan- guage in which he
is fluent. It is the job of the manager to make the specialist realize
that he cannot become effective unless he is understood, and that he
cannot be understood unless he tries to find out the needs, the
assumptions, and the limitations of his “custom- ers,” the other people
(also, often, specialists in their own areas) within the organization.
It is the manager who has to translate the objectives of the
organization into the language of the specialist, and the output of the
specialist into the language of the intended user. It is the manager, in
other words, on whom the specialist depends for the integration of his
output into the work of others.</p>
<p>Yet, while the career professional needs a manager to be effective,
the manager is not his boss. The manager is his “guide,” his “tool,” and
his “marketing arm.” The manager is the channel through which the career
professional, and especially the true specialist, can direct his
knowledge, his work, and his capacities toward joint results, and
through which</p>
<p>*In my book, The Effective Executive, I proposed to call these people
“executives,” the term to embrace both the traditional “managers” and
the nonmanaging professional with responsibility for determining the
objectives of contribution and result of their work, who are expected to
make decisions that affect the performance and wealth-producing
potential of the entire business.</p>
<p>in turn, he finds out the needs, the capacities, and the
opportunities of the enterprise of which he is a member.</p>
<p>In one way, indeed, the true career professional will and should be
the “superior” of his manager. He must be the “teacher” and the
“educator.” It is the career professional’s job to teach management, to
raise its vision, to show new opportunities, new horizons, new and more
demanding standards. In that sense, every career professional should be
expected to be the senior in his relationship to his manager and,
indeed, to managers within the organization. If he does not take the
responsibility for leadership within his area of expertise and knowledge
he is not a true career professional. He is instead a sub- ordinate
“technician.”</p>
<p>Title, Function, and Pay of the Career Professional</p>
<p>The thorny problems of title, function, and pay of managers and
career professionals can- not be completely solved. But they can be
deprived, in substantial measure, of their ca- pacity to disturb and to
misdirect.</p>
<p>Traditionally, there has been only one line of advancement in
organizations; a man could acquire higher pay and status by becoming a
manager. As a result, a good many people who deserved recognition and
reward did not receive them. Or, in order to give recognition and
reward, people who neither wanted to manage nor were competent in doing
so were put into management positions.</p>
<p>This system is inappropriate to the reality of today’s organization,
and especially of today’s business enterprise. Men should be able to
move freely from one kind of work to the other as they advance. We
should therefore have a system of rank and title that differ- entiates
clearly between a man’s function and his standing within the
organization.</p>
<p>In the military services the separation between rank and function has
long been rou- tine. A man is a Major and this establishes his rank. But
it does not tell us whether he is in command of a battalion—that is, a
manager or whether he works in the Pentagon as a researcher—that is, as
an individual professional contributor. His rank is Major; but his
functional title, Battalion Commander or Communications Specialist,
describes his as- signment.</p>
<p>It might make sense to call all members of the management group
executives and to have only four ranks within an organization: junior
executive; executive; senior executive; and corporate executive. Then
one could have a system of rank which cuts across the dis- tinction
between managerial and non-managerial positions. One could, then,
describe a man’s position, whether it be Senior Engineer—Heat Treating
or Manager—Cost Con- trol, and separate thereby rank and function. Such
a system is more likely to succeed than a system which tries to build
“parallel ladders.”</p>
<p>The traditional definition of a manager also implies that he, being
the superior, must get more money than the men who report to him and who
are considered his “inferiors.” This makes sense on the assembly line
and in clerical work. It is also appropriate for the junior knowledge
worker who is not yet a career professional and who is not expected to
take full responsibility for his objectives and contribution. But it
makes little sense for the true professional, that is, for the man who
is considered to be the leader in his field within an enterprise and the
pacesetter within his area. For him, the right rules are those that ap-
ply to “performers,” whether in the arts or in sports.</p>
<p>No one finds it strange that the star baseball player gets more money
than his coach or even the team’s manager. Nobody is surprised that the
prima donna gets more for one appearance that the opera manager may earn
in the entire year. It is clearly understood by everybody that the
top-flight athlete or the outstanding singer needs a manager—and yet
their contributions are different and justify differential payment as a
result of which, the organizationally “subordinate” receives more money
than the “superior,” that is, the man- ager.</p>
<p>There is even an instructive business precedent for this. When Pierre
S. du Pont and Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., first attempted, in 1920, to bring
order into the chaos of the General</p>
<p>Motors Company, they set the same salary for the heads of the
operating divisions as for the president, Pierre du Pont. But, at his
own request, Sloan received substantially less as the operating
vice-president to whom the division heads reported. The manager of a
unit composed of career professionals or specialists will, of course,
receive more money than most of the men in the unit, but it should not
be considered unusual, let alone undesirable, for one or two “stars” of
the group to receive more money than the manager. This can apply just as
well to salesmen; a star salesman should be expected to make more money
than the regional sales manager. It should apply in the research
laboratory, and in all other areas where performance depends on
individual skill, effort, and knowledge.</p>
<p>There should be no distinction between members of the management
group who are managers and those who are career professionals in the
demands made on them. The managers differ from the other professionals
only in having one extra dimension in their responsibility and
performance. The difference between the market research manager with a
staff of fifty people and the market researcher who does the same job
without any staff is in means rather than in contribution, let alone in
function. Both should be held to the same demand. Both are “management”
and “managers.”</p>
