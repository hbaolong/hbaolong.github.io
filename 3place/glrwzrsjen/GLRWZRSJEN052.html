<h4 id="top-management-tasks">50 Top-Management Tasks</h4>
<p>The Dimensions of the Top-Management Task—Specific Needs in Specific
Busi- nesses—To “Operate” or Not to “Operate” —The Rules—Recurrent but
Intermittent Tasks—Required: A Diversity of Capabilities and
Temperaments—Top-Management Tasks and Chief-Executive Styles—The
Top-Management Work Plan</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>VERY MANAGERIAL UNIT other than top management is designed for one
spe- cific major task—whether the organization is structured on
functional lines, in teams, on the basis of decentralization, or on the
systems approach. Every building block of organization is defined by a
specific contribution.</p>
<p>The one exception is top management. Its job is multidimensional.
There is no top- management task; there are only top-management tasks.
And this is just as true for public- service institutions as it is for
businesses.</p>
<p>Since each of the management tasks has been identified earlier in
this book, what fol- lows is mainly recapitulation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is, first, the task of thinking through the mission of the
business, that is, of asking the question “What is our business and what
should it be?” This leads to the setting of objectives, the development
of strategies and plans, and the making of today’s deci- sions for
tomorrow’s results. This clearly can be done only by an organ of the
business that can see the entire business; that can make decisions that
affect the entire business; that can balance objectives and the needs of
today against the needs, of tomorrow; and that can allocate resources of
men and money to key results.</p></li>
<li><p>There is need for standard setting, example setting, i.e., for
the conscience func- tions. There is need for an organ of the enterprise
which concerns itself with the gap— always a big one—between what the
organization stands for and what it actually does. There is a need for
an organ concerned with vision and values in the key areas. Again this
can only be an organ of the enterprise that sees and comprehends the
entire business.</p></li>
<li><p>There is the responsibility to build and maintain the human
organization. There is need for work on developing the human resources
for tomorrow, and especially for work on providing tomorrow’s top
management. The spirit of an organization is created by the people at
the top. Their standards of conduct, their values, their beliefs, set
the example for their entire organization and determine its
self-respect.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is need also for thinking through organization structure and
organization design.</p>
<p>This requires someone, or a group of people, who can see the entire
business and can make decisions in contemplation of the entire
business.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Equally important are major relations which only the people at the
top of a business can establish and maintain. They may be relations to
customers or major suppliers. They</li>
</ol>
<p>may be industry relations or relations with bankers and the financial
community. They may be relations to governments or other outside
institutions. These relations crucially affect the capacity of the
business to perform. And they are relations that can be made, again,
only by somebody who represents the entire business, speaks for it,
stands for it, commits it.</p>
<p>Out of these relations emerges a host of top-management policy
decisions and ac- tions—on the environment and on the social impact of a
business; on its employment policies and on its position on proposed
legislation.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>There are countless “ceremonial” functions—dinners, civic events,
etc.—that are actually more time-consuming and less easy to avoid for
the top people in a small or me- dium-sized business that is prominent
in its focal community than they are for the heads of the very big
companies.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the head of a fair-sized company said, “As long as the president
of General Electric sends a check he can be represented by one of his
vice-presidents—and he has sixty-five of them. I have to go myself; we
are the largest employers in the place.”</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>There is also need for a “stand-by” organ for major crises, for
somebody who is available to take over when things go seriously wrong.
Then it is the most experienced, the wisest, the most prominent people
in an organization who have to roll up their sleeves and go to work.
They are legally responsible. But there is also a responsibility of
knowl- edge—and it cannot be abdicated.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is still a partial list only. It should prove, however, that the
top-management task will not get done unless it is recognized as a
distinct function, a distinct kind of work, and organized as such.</p>
<p>But this list also shows that while there is a genuine top-management
function there is no general formula for the top-management tasks.</p>
<p>Every business, indeed every institution, needs a top-management
function. But every one has specific top-management tasks. The elements
of the job are the same. But the specific top-management tasks are
particular to an individual business. They have to be developed out of a
specific analysis of the mission and purpose of the institution, its ob-
jectives, its strategies, and the key activities. The question to ask is
not “What is top man- agement?” The question is “What are the specific
things to be done in this business which are of crucial importance to
the success and survival of the business and which can be done only by
top management?” “What are the specific things which can be done only by
people who see this business whole; who can balance the present needs of
the business against the needs of the future; and who can make final and
effective decisions?”</p>
<p>It therefore makes little sense to talk of an “ideal” top-management
structure—as a good many of the books on the subject do. The ideal top
management is the one that does the things that are right and proper for
its enterprise here and now. We need, to be sure, a theory of top
management. But the specific application must be developed concretely,
indeed pragmatically. It, must be tailored to the individual enterprise.
It must be devel- oped from an analysis of the specific enterprise. It
must, above all, follow the strategies of the enterprise and be in
harmony with them.</p>
<p>To “Operate” or Not to “Operate”</p>
<p>Only the analysis of the individual business (or public-service
institution) will bring out what key activities are properly
top-management responsibilities.</p>
<p>The management texts agree that top management should not “operate.”
And most in- formed observers of top management agree that the most
common reason why the top- management job doesn’t get done is that top
executives “operate” and, in consequence, do not tackle the
top-management tasks.</p>
<p>Yet Georg Siemens in his top-management design included a good deal
of “operating work.” He did not confine his top management to directing
others, to planning, to review-</p>
<p>ing, to setting the direction of his Bank. On the contrary, the first
job of the members of his top-management team was specific work on the
major industrial and financial invest- ments the bank had decided to
develop. It was not “directing” the work of others but “do- ing.” Far
from isolating themselves from the “nuts and bolts,” Siemens’s top men
were supposed to take direct personal responsibility for finding the
right investment opportuni- ties and for developing them into
successful, well-managed businesses. Clearly this was one of the secrets
of the success of the Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p>Effective top managements tend to follow the Siemens practice rather
than the theo- rist’s and consultant’s preaching.</p>
<p>Here are some examples. A medium-sized French producer of branded and
nationally advertised consumer goods has gained, within the last decade
or two, a strong position in the European markets. One of the reasons is
that the head of the company is also the com- pany’s advertising and
promotion manager. He himself writes most of the company’s ad-
vertisements and designs the company’s promotions. He also has assigned
to himself di- rect responsibility for relations with the dealers
throughout Europe, and especially throughout France. He personally
visits about thirty of the larger dealers in the course of a year,
listens to them, studies their businesses, and altogether manages the
company’s rela- tionship with them. “Our business is a promotion
business. Our business, above all, de- pends on the willingness of the
dealers to work hard at selling our merchandise. Our busi- ness,
therefore, depends on our knowing the dealers and their knowing us, and
on our willingness and ability to design products they want to sell and
can sell, to deliver them the way they need them delivered, and to price
them in line with the price preferences of their customers.” Yet the
same man flatly refuses to have anything to do with manufactur- ing—even
though his own background is manufacturing engineering.</p>
<p>Work on major innovations may be such an “operating” top-management
task at a given stage of a company’s development.</p>
<p>A large pharmaceutical company, for instance, decided to broaden its
base. It had long held leadership in one major area but decided that its
product base was too narrow. It identified several new areas in which it
expected to become an important factor, each re- quiring the development
of new drugs. In each of the three areas it selected one of the members
of top management moved in as a member—but not the leader—of the
“project team” formed to develop the new products and to develop the new
business. In the early stages leadership in the task force rested, of
necessity, with the research scientists. But even then the
top-management member of the project team actively worked, thinking
through the marketing strategies, working on medical testing and on
obtaining approval from the government regulatory agencies involved;
planning the changes necessary in the sales, force to enable the company
to move into fields in which it had no acceptance by the medical
profession as a reliable supplier.</p>
<p>This work, it was felt, and rightly so, was so crucial to the future
of the company and, at the same time, involved so many basic and
difficult decisions, that a member of top management had to gain direct
working experience in the field for the whole group to be able to make
the necessary decisions and take the necessary action.</p>
<p>Another example: Sears, Roebuck is a company which, from its early
days, has in- sisted on keeping top management out of operations, and
confined to top-management tasks. No one believed in this more firmly
than General Wood. Yet when Wood systema- tized the top-management job
and organized a three-man top-management team, he as- signed to top
management as a “doing” responsibility the selection of sites for new
major retail stores. This decision, he argued, had long-range and
irreversible impact on the com- pany’s ability to sell and to make
money. Once the site has been selected and a store has been built, there
is a twenty-year commitment. A decision like this, though clearly an op-
erating decision, has to be made by top management. And to be able to
make the decision intelligently, a member of top management has to work
on the project from the beginning.</p>
<p>These are clearly dangerous precedents. If operating work can be
legitimately in- cluded in the top-management job, then chief executives
who open all the incoming letters or who themselves do the final
inspection of the company’s products—and I have seen</p>
<p>both done, and in fairly large businesses—can claim that they are
doing top-management work (as indeed both did).</p>
<p>The rules are simple:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is not top-management work if someone else can do it. Of
course, most operating work will be eliminated as top-management work by
the analysis of key activities; for top management should never be
involved in any other activities. But key activities should then be
subjected to the question “Could anyone else in the organization do them
just as well—or nearly as well? At least, should there be someone
capable of doing them?” If the answer is yes, it is not top-management
work.</p></li>
<li><p>People who move into top-management work should, further, give up
the functional or operating work they did earlier. That should always be
turned over to someone else. Otherwise they are likely to remain
functional or operating people.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But it is not in itself a final argument against inclusion of this or
that task in the top- management function to say, “This is operating
work.” The many executives who, despite all the exhortations in the
books, continue to operate, have a sound instinct. But if they do not
subject the top-management job to a searching analysis of key
activities, they will do the wrong operating work. They will do the
things they are familiar with and like to do. They will do the things
they have always done. And they will slight the “operating” work that
actually belongs in the top-management job.</p>
<p>The Characteristics of Top-Management Tasks</p>
<p>The top-management function is singularly difficult to organize.
Every one of the tasks is a recurrent task. It needs to be done over and
over again. But very few of them, if any, are continuous tasks. Very few
of them have to be done every day from nine to five. When they arise,
they are of crucial importance to the enterprise. They are the true
“life and death” decisions. But it would be foolish to “plan” five days
a week fifty-two weeks a year. Key personnel decisions also arise fairly
infrequently. But then they require a great deal of time; few things are
less likely to succeed than hasty personnel decisions. And the same
applies to most of the other top-management tasks.</p>
<p>But individuals require a continuing day-to-day job. They do little
work, as a rule, unless they work steadily.</p>
<p>Another peculiar characteristic of top-management tasks is that they
require a diver- sity of capabilities, and, above all, of temperaments.
They require the capacity to analyze, to think, to weigh alternatives,
and to harmonize dissent. But they also require the capac- ity for quick
and decisive action, for boldness and for intuitive courage. They
require be- ing at home with abstract ideas, concepts, calculations, and
figures. They also require perception of people, a human awareness, and
empathy and altogether a lively interest in people and respect for them.
Some tasks demand that a man work by himself, and alone. Others are
tasks of representation and ceremonial, outside tasks, that require the
politi- cian’s enjoyment of crowds and protocol; the ability to
represent and to make a good im- pression by saying nothing.</p>
<p>The top-management tasks require at least four different kinds of
human being: the “thought man,” “the action man,” the “people man,” and
the “front man.” Yet those four temperaments are almost never found in
one person.</p>
<p>Failure to understand these characteristics is a main reason why the
top-management task is so often done poorly or not at all.</p>
<p>Because the tasks, while continuing, are not continuous, the
top-management job itself is often seen, even by people running sizable
businesses, as something that will be done if and when the need arises.
But in the meantime, that is, day by day, the people at the top feel the
need to do a continuing job. That, of course, means that they do
functional work. For there is day-to-day work in manufacturing and
marketing, in accounting and engineer-</p>
<p>ing, in advertising and in quality control. And the top-management
tasks will not get done at all. There are simply too many of them to be
done that way. While each individual task within the top-management
function may require only a comparatively limited amount of time in the
smaller and less complicated business, the totality of the
top-management function, even in the small business, is far too large to
be handled on the side and in addi- tion to functional work. Day-by-day
operating work always has urgency—and many top- management jobs are for
the long pull and look as if they can wait until the “tomorrow” that
never comes.</p>
<p>In addition, the top man, even in the large business, tends to see
only those parts of the top-management function which are congenial to
him. They will then constitute for him the top-management job—and it
will get done. The top man is right when he assigns to himself those
top-management tasks that fit his personality, his temperament, his
experi- ence. He is wrong, however, in believing, often without
conscious thought, that this takes care of the top-management function.
It actually makes the business unbalanced and likely to be out of
control.</p>
<p>The first requirement of effective top management, as Georg Siemens
saw a century ago is to identify objectively all the key activities and
key tasks of top management in the</p>
<p>business. The old saw that “every chief executive has his own style
and decides what top management is” is nonsense. Every chief
executive—indeed, every person—has his own style and is entitled to it.
But what decides what top management is or should be is an objective
decision. It depends no more on individual style than—the law of gravity
de- pends on what the physicist had for breakfast.</p>
<p>The fact that the top-management tasks, or at least a good many of
them, while con- tinuous tasks, are not continuous work and the fact
that the top-management tasks demand a diversity of qualifications,
skills, and temperaments make it essential that every top- management
task be clearly assigned to someone. Otherwise, important tasks will be
overlooked. In fact, there should be a top-management work
plan—especially in the small business—which spells out in considerable
detail who is responsible for what; what the objectives and goals are
with respect to each task, and what the deadlines are. Precisely because
the top-management function differs in basic character from practically
every other kind of work within the enterprise, it has to be specific
and has to be clearly as- signed.</p>
