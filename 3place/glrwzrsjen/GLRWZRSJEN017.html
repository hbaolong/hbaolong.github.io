<h4 id="the-new-realities">15 The New Realities</h4>
<p>Work and Its Ambivalence— “Work” and “Working” —Work and Worker in
Rapid Change—The “Employee Society” —The Shift to the Knowledge
Worker—The Crisis of the Manual Worker— “Hard Hats” versus “Liberals”
—The Crisis of the Labor Union—Managing the Knowledge Worker; the New
Challenge—What Is Productivity in Knowledge Work? —And What Is
Achievement? —The Segmentation of the Work Force—The Fallacy of the “One
Personnel Policy” —The “New Breed”</p>
<p>F</p>
<p>EW WORDS IN THE LANGUAGE are as ambivalent as “work,” and as
emotionladen. There are “work and rest”; and “rest” is clearly “good.”
But whether “retire ment” is better than “work” is already questionable.
There is no doubt that work is preferable to “idleness.” And being “out
of work” is far from “good”—is, indeed, a catastrophe.</p>
<p>There are “work and play.” “Play” carries a favorable connotation.
But “playing at being a surgeon” is not good at all. Work can be high
achievement, as in the phrase “an artist’s life work.” Or it can be
sheer drudgery, backbreaking, and utter boredom.</p>
<p>Language thus makes it abundantly clear that work is complex and that
it is embedded in man’s life, in his emotions, in his existence in
society and community, and in his relationship to himself.</p>
<p>Work is both noun and verb. There are “work” and “working.” They are
totally dependent on each other. Unless someone is working, no work gets
done. But unless there is work, there is also no working.</p>
<p>Yet work and working are quite different. Work is impersonal, and
objective. It is a “something.” Not all work can be weighed or measured.
Even the most intangible piece of work is outside the worker and
independent of him.</p>
<p>What distinguishes work from play is an old question that has never
been answered satisfactorily. The activity itself is often the same,
down to the smallest detail. Yet psychologically and socially, the two
are quite different. The true distinction may well be that work, unlike
play, is impersonal and objective. Work has a result that is outside of
the worker. The purpose of play lies in the player; the purpose of work
lies with the user of the end product. Where the end product is not
determined by the player but by others, we do not speak of play, we
speak of work. We say that someone is playing chess—but we say also that
someone is working on a chess problem.</p>
<p>Even the work of the artist is impersonal and a “thing.” To have
artistic validity, a work of art must indeed be an extension of the
artist’s personality. Otherwise it is sterile, academic, without power
to move. But even the most subjective painter, when looking at a picture
he has just finished, will not ask, “Is this me?” He will ask, “Is it
right?” And, as has often been remarked, no listener could possibly
guess at the turmoil and despair in which Beethoven lived when he wrote
his most joyful and happiest symphony, the Seventh. Indeed, knowing the
conditions under which the work was produced adds nothing to the
listener’s enjoyment, to his appreciation of the music, or to its power
to move.</p>
<p>But working is done by a human being, a worker. It is a uniquely
human activity.</p>
<p>Working, therefore, is physiology and psychology, society and
community, personality, economics, and power. As the old human relations
tag has it, “One cannot hire a hand; the whole man always comes with
it.”</p>
<p>Work and working, therefore, follow different rules. Work belongs to
the realm of objects. It has its own impersonal logic. But working
belongs to the realm of man. It has dynamics. Yet the manager always has
to manage both work and working. He has to make work productive and the
worker achieving. He has to integrate work and worker.</p>
<p>Both work and worker are in a period of rapid change. The changes
that will dominate the rest of this century—and probably most of the
next century as well—are the most radical changes since the beginning of
the industrial revolution more than two hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Most of the working population, certainly in the developed countries,
now work as employees. They work in organizations rather than by
themselves. They work outside of and away from their families. Society
has become an employee society. Only a century ago the great majority of
people—especially, of course, farmers—worked either by themselves or in
very small groups. Work still centered around the home.</p>
<p>At the same time the center of gravity of the work force is shifting
from the manual worker to the knowledge worker. A larger and larger
proportion of the labor force in all developed countries does not work
with its hands, whether as skilled or as unskilled workers, but with
ideas, concepts, theories. In the Marxist—or Russian—usage of the term,
they are “intelligentsia.” Their output is not a physical object, but
knowledge and ideas. Again, only half a century ago, knowledge work was
primarily performed by independent professionals working either alone or
in very small groups. The bulk of the labor force was manual
workers.</p>
<p>Knowledge work need not be highly skilled or highly schooled. Filing,
after all, requires neither high mental capacity nor advanced schooling.
But the tool of the file clerk is not hammer or sickle, but the
alphabet, that is, a high-level abstraction and a symbol rather than a
thing. One does not learn the alphabet through experience but through
formal education.</p>
<p>The Crisis of the Manual Worker</p>
<p>These changes mean, first, a crisis with respect to the manual worker
and to his specific organization, the labor union.</p>
<p>For two hundred years the manual worker in industry, the child of the
Industrial Revolution, has been struggling to gain economic security,
status, and power in industrial society. During the last fifty years,
since the end of World War I, his progress was dazzling. In most
developed countries the manual worker, only yesterday a “proletarian”
scratching a bare living at the margin of subsistence, has acquired
substantial economic security, an income level higher than that of the
well-to-do middle class of yesterday, and increasing political
power.</p>
<p>With the rise of the knowledge worker, he is endangered again. His
economic security is not threatened—on the contrary, it is likely to
become even more firmly established. But his social position and status
are rapidly diminishing. In the developed countries, the industrial
worker sees himself severely deprived. He is defeated, a loser, before
he even starts—especially the younger one. This is not a result of
managerial actions, but of social developments and of the pressures they
generate.</p>
<p>Increasingly in all developed societies the able, intelligent, and
ambitious members of the working class stay in school beyond the point
at which they are eligible for manual work. All the pressures of
society, family and neighbors, community and school, push the youngster
toward more schooling. The one who leaves school at the age at which he
once would have graduated into the manual work force—fifteen or so—is a
dropout, a failure, a reject.</p>
<p>The young manual worker of today therefore starts out with a feeling
of rejection, a feeling of failure, a conviction of being a second-class
citizen. In most developed countries (Britain and France are perhaps the
only exceptions so far, though things are changing there rapidly too)
close members of his own family, a brother, a sister, or a cousin, stay
on in school and graduate into knowledge work and into a superior social
class. Indeed, the young blue-collar workers themselves tend to be
highly schooled, at least in the U.S. Most of them have finished
secondary school; and more than half have gone on to some kind of
college at least for a year—and then dropped out. But this only adds to
the sense of defeat and rejection for the younger manual worker.
Seventy-five or one hundred years ago there was a self-respecting
working class, that is, a working class that knew itself to be the equal
of its “betters,’’ except in income and economic position.</p>
<p>But the manual worker of today in the developed countries does not
respect himself.</p>
<p>This inevitably makes him bitter, suspicious, distrustful of himself
as well as of organization and management, and resentful. He is not a
revolutionary, as his parents and grandparents were. For it is obvious
to him that revolution cannot alter the fundamental conditions—apart
from the fact that, in sharp contrast to the Marxian prophecy of fifty
years ago, knowledge workers are rapidly becoming the majority instead
of the proletarians. But the manual worker of today is a militant and
likely to become more militant as the center of social gravity keeps on
shifting toward knowledge work and knowledge worker.</p>
<p>The rhetoric of workers’ parties and movements still talks of the
wicked capitalists and lambasts the profit system. But the true class
war is increasingly being fought between the hard hats—manual
workers—and the liberals—the employed, middle-class knowledge workers.
It was their coalition everywhere—in America’s New Deal as well as in
the social democratic and labor parties of Europe (beginning with the
“Lib-Lab” coalition that put into power the first “modern” government,
Lloyd George’s 1907 cabinet in Britain—which created the progressive
Left and dominated politics in all developed countries during most of
this century so far. The major political event for the remainder of this
century may well be a growing split between these two groups.</p>
<p>In the U.S.—and to a lesser extent in Great Britain and Western
Europe—the years since World War II have brought a massive shift in
opportunities, power, and status from the worker to the middle-class
professional, that is, to teachers, social workers, and administrators
of government programs. The relative shares of national income from
wages and salaries and from income on property changed little in these
years, nor did the income distribution between high and low incomes
change much. But the middle group gained greatly, especially relative to
workers. Whatever the social programs of the last twentyfive years in
the developed countries were meant to achieve, they all had as their
first— and often as their main—result a growth in numbers, income, and
power of the employed, middle-class knowledge worker.</p>
<p>Considerable doubt has been cast on the old assumption that higher
school expenditures per child necessarily mean better education and
better schools. But they certainly mean higher incomes for more
teachers. Whether the programs of America’s war on poverty helped many
of, the poor is questionable, but they created untold well-paying jobs
for social workers, accountants, and administrators. While the
environment may, one hopes, benefit more from the environmental crusade
than the poor did from the war on poverty, the first beneficiaries are,
of course, biologists, engineers, chemists, and so on. All these
programs are paid for out of taxes on the middle-income groups—there is
no other large tax base in a developed country; and “middle-income
group” is the economist’s euphemism for “workers,” who, inescapably, pay
the cost for most of these programs that directly benefit better paid
and more educated “knowledge people.” That these exactions are levied in
the name of progress and for liberal or “left-wing” causes adds insult
to the injury—at least in the eyes of the hard hat.</p>
<p>The Crisis of the Labor Union</p>
<p>The changes in the status of the manual worker that attend the shift
in emphasis to knowledge work and knowledge worker not only create a new
class cleavage—more divisive, potentially, than the one that set
proletarian against bourgeoisie in the opening decades of the nineteenth
century—but also create severe difficulties for the manual worker’s own
institution, the labor union. Perhaps the most visible sign of this is
the sharp drop in the quality of trade-union leadership—in large measure
as a result of the “educational explosion.” Labor-union, leadership was
the career opportunity for the able and ambitious young worker of
yesterday whom lack of means forced out of school early and thus
deprived of the opportunity to move out of the working class into the
middle class, if not into the ranks of the bosses.</p>
<p>The late Walter Reuther of the United Automobile Workers’ Union for
twenty-five years was the best known, the most respected, and perhaps
the most powerful American labor leader. Reuther started, in the 1920s,
to go to college. If he had been able to stay on and to get his degree,
he might well have been, twenty years later, one of the top men in the
automobile industry. He had drive, ambition, intelligence, and an
intuitive grasp of economic and business problems. He was a skillful
organization politician who knew how to build an internal political
machine. But he was also a loyal organization man. That he started out
with deep socialist convictions might have made little difference. After
all, Henry Ford was widely considered at one time to be an “anarchist.”
Many of the men who ran the automobile industry in the forties and early
fifties—including Charles Wilson, who succeeded Alfred P. Sloan as chief
executive at GM—had the same background and, like Reuther, grew up in
working-class homes, in which Eugene Debs, the American socialist leader
of pre-World War I days, was the chief deity.</p>
<p>But when the early Depression years forced Reuther to drop out of
college, he became instead a machinist on the assembly line. From then
on all the energies of an able and ambitious man were channeled into the
one career opportunity available to him, union leadership.</p>
<p>In the developed countries today the able and ambitious youngster
stays in school— and may go on to a graduate degree. As a result, he
moves into the professional and managerial ranks. His convictions may
still be “left.” But his leadership qualities are lost to the working
class. The leaders who are moving into the vacuum this creates are
likely to be men driven by resentment rather than by ambition, of far
lower ability, and above all, men without self-confidence. They are weak
leaders—and the worst situation for an industry to be in is to have to
deal with weak union leadership.</p>
<p>At the same time, the fact that the young worker sees himself a
“loser” makes him resist and resent the very union leaders he selects
and puts into office. The moment a man holds an important leadership
position in the trade union, he automatically becomes “establishment.”
He has to consort with the mighty, whether in government or in business.
He has to exercise power. He has to have the trappings of power—the big
office, the retinue of aides and assistants, the four telephones on the
desk, and so on. In order to be effective, he has to become one of
“them” and ceases to be one of “us.” Yesterday’s worker looked upon
union power as representing him. He was proud of the fact that the union
leader had become a person of authority. Today’s young worker, feeling
keenly that he is a loser and a reject, resists, understandably, the
union leader’s authority even more than he resists the rest of the
bosses. As a result, union leaders are increasingly losing control over
their own members, are repudiated by them, resisted by them, disavowed
by them. This, in turn, makes the union increasingly weak. For a union
is impotent if it cannot deliver the union member’s vote and behavior,
cannot guarantee observance of a contract agreement, and cannot count on
the members’ support for the leader’s position and actions.</p>
<p>The future of the trade union and its role in industrial society,
especially in developed countries, is beyond the scope of this book.
There is very little doubt that collective bargaining, whether between
an individual company and a trade union, or—as in Western</p>
<p>Europe and Japan—between an industry and an industry-wide union, is
in trouble. Whether the “civilized industrial warfare” of collective
bargaining—a major achievement of the early years of the twentieth
century—can even survive is questionable. What could take its place is
altogether obscure.</p>
<p>All attempts to replace collective bargaining by some other
arrangement, such as the Swedish and Dutch approaches to tripartite
settlements worked out in the national interest by representatives of
public, management, and labor together, have been short-lived. They work
in an emergency—such as the period in which Holland rebuilt its economy
after World War II. But they have proven unable to survive major
pressures, such as inflation. They are increasingly rejected by the new
breed of workers.</p>
<p>No economy—and indeed, no society—can tolerate either unbridled
industrial warfare, and especially unbridled industrial guerrilla
warfare, or the constant escalation of labor costs and constant heavy
inflation. Government control is no answer either. Wageprice policies
have so far worked fitfully at best and for limited periods only.</p>
<p>But an organ for the representation of the worker against management,
or at least to management, is needed—by the workers, but also by
society.*</p>
<p>Management, no matter how selected or constituted, is, and has to be,
a power. Any power needs restraint and control—or else it becomes
tyranny. The union is a very peculiar, an almost unprecedented, organ of
restraint on the political power of management. It is an opposition
which can never become the government. Yet within its limited scope it
serves an essential function in industrial society. But it is
increasingly becoming incapable of discharging this function.</p>
<p>The opposition function of the labor union will be needed more in the
future than ever in the past. The manual worker is beginning to feel
rightly—that he can no longer depend on a political party and its appeal
to a majority. That is the consequence of the gradual dissolution of the
New Deal, Labor, or social democratic marriage between worker and
liberal. Increasingly, also, the power which needs restraining is not
that of the bosses or the capitalists but of the educated middle class
of knowledge workers. They are not greatly interested in profits, but
all the more in power. The most bitter power conflicts are not those
that erupt in private enterprise or in business; they are conflicts
between janitors and school boards, medical orderlies and hospital
administrators, teaching assistants and graduate faculties, or, as in
the Swedish steel industry, between workers and their staunchly
socialist bosses in a nationalized industry. They are conflicts between
workers and the public interest (at least as defined by the liberals).
In such conflicts political parties which aim at mass support and at
attracting a majority of the voters are almost bound to be on the side
of the bosses, if only because no amount of rhetoric can conceal that
the price for a settlement will not be paid out of profits but surely
out of prices or taxes.</p>
<p>Public-service institutions may face a much more difficult industrial
relations problem than business and are much less prepared for it.
Hospitals, schools, government agencies, and so on have all become
increasingly unionized. In these institutions the manual worker—or the
lower ranking clerical worker—feels even more “dispossessed,” and even
more confined to second-class citizenship than the manua1 worker does in
manufacturing or service industries.</p>
<p>The unions themselves are incapable of thinking through their own
future role and developing new approaches to their own structure and
function. One reason is that the new leaders who replace the dying or
retiring pioneers are so often men of lesser ability, lesser maturity,
and lesser competence. But as important is the fact that the new leaders
can keep their slender grip on the membership only by being “against”
everything. The new leaders dare not even ask questions, let alone come
up with answers. They dare not lead but are forced to make violent
motions to stay in place. The pitiful failure of the British trade
unions to tackle the problems of union reform to which every new General
Secretary of the Trades Union Congress commits himself in ringing tones
when he assumes office is one example of many.</p>
<p>*On this see my book, The New Society (New York and London,
1950).</p>
<p>The politician too is unlikely to ask these, questions, let alone
answer them. He is paralyzed by the split between workers and liberals.
If he himself is a liberal, he is caught in the crossfire between the
two constituencies whose support he needs to get elected and to stay in
office. If he is not a liberal, he must increasingly be attracted by the
hope to gain for himself the support of one of the embittered partners
in the former marriage. Every conservative leader of recent years—Nixon
in the U.S., Heath in England, De Gaulle and Pompidou in France—has,
therefore, ducked the issue fully as much as the liberals. They can,
under pressures of a public opinion that is increasingly tired of
industrial warfare and especially of strikes “against the public
interest” (or, more bitterly resented, “against public convenience),
clamp down on union power. They may even within the foreseeable future
be pushed into action against monopolies—with respect to craft
jurisdiction and restraint of access to a trade, for instance. But they
are highly unlikely to be willing or able to tackle new basic
policy.</p>
<p>We need new policy in industrial relations. In all developed
countries—but in developing ones as well—managers in business and in
public-service institutions will, therefore, have to think through the
future of the union, its role, its function, and its position, both
within the institution and in society. This is a major social
responsibility of management. But it is also a business responsibility
of management. The future of business and of the economy, as well as
that of society, will be influenced greatly by the way we solve or fail
to solve the growing and deepening crisis of the labor unions. To think
through the role and function of the labor union is also self-interest
for management. To believe that labor-union weakness means management
strength is sheer self-delusion. One may deplore unionization (I myself
have rarely been considered pro-union by anyone in the labor movement).
But once there is a union—and unionization is a fact in all developed
noncommunist countries—a weak union, that is, one without established
role, function, and authority and without strong, secure, and effective
leadership, means strife, demagoguery, irresponsible demands, and
increasing bitterness and tension. It does not mean management strength;
it means management frustration.</p>
<p>Managing the Knowledge Worker; the New Challenge</p>
<p>Managing the manual worker and labor-union relations, while crucial
to society, are essentially rearguard actions for the manager. All he
can hope to do is to contain damage which two hundred years of
industrial history have left behind. Even this limited objective will
require very drastic changes in policies and practices. It will
certainly require even more drastic changes in managerial assumptions
and managerial attitudes. But the aim will have to be fairly modest. Not
to lose ground will be difficult enough—whether in productivity, in
motivation, or in relationships. To regain ground lost in two hundred
years of what can only be called industrial mismanagement is badly
needed, but it must today be considered a hope rather than a rational
expectation.</p>
<p>Managing knowledge work and knowledge worker is “today and tomorrow”
rather than “yesterday.” Because it is essentially a new task, we know
even less about it than we know about the management (or mismanagement)
of the manual worker. It is, therefore, going to be the more difficult
task. But there is no long legacy of bitterness, of mutual suspicion, of
resentment masquerading as scientific theories, and of folklore that has
set into the hard concrete of restrictions, rules, and regulations.
Managing knowledge work and knowledge worker therefore can focus on
developing the right policies and practices. It can focus on the future
rather than on undoing the past, on the opportunities rather than on
“problems.’’</p>
<p>Managing knowledge work and knowledge worker will require exceptional
imagination, exceptional courage, and leadership of a high order. In
some ways it will be a far more demanding task than managing the manual
worker was until very recently. For the weapon of fear—fear of economic
suffering, fear of job security, physical fear of company guards or of
the state’s police power—which for so long substituted for managing
manual work and the manual worker, is simply not operative at all in the
context of</p>
<p>knowledge work and knowledge worker. The knowledge worker, except on
the very lowest levels of knowledge work, is not productive under the
spur of fear; only selfmotivation and self-direction can make him
productive. He has to be achieving in order to produce at all.</p>
<p>The productivity, indeed the social cohesion, of every developed
society rests increasingly on the ability to make knowledge work
productive and the knowledge worker achieving. This may be the central
social problem of the new, the knowledge society. There are no
precedents for the management of knowledge work. Knowledge work
traditionally has been carried out by individuals working by themselves
in small groups.* Now knowledge work is carried out in large, complex,
managed institutions. The knowledge worker is not even the successor to
yesterday’s “knowledge professional.” He is the successor to yesterday’s
skilled worker. His status, his function, his contribution, his position
in the organization, therefore, still have to be defined.</p>
<p>Worse, we cannot truly define, let alone measure, productivity for
most knowledge work. One can define and measure it for the file clerk or
the salesgirl in the variety store. But productivity is already a murky
term with respect to the field salesman of a manufacturing business. Is
it total sales? Or is it the profit contribution from sales, which might
vary tremendously with the product mix individual salesmen might sell?
Or is it sales (or profit contribution) related to the potential of a
sales territory? Perhaps a salesman’s ability to hold old customers
should be considered central to his productivity. Or perhaps it should
be his ability to generate new accounts. These problems are far more
complex than the definition and measurement of the productivity of even
the highly skilled manual worker. There one can almost always define and
measure productivity in terms of the quantity of output—e.g., the number
of pairs of shoes produced per hour, per day, or per week above a
minimum quality standard.</p>
<p>Far more difficult even is a definition of productivity for the
design engineer or the service engineer; for the quality control man or
the sales forecaster; for the teacher (almost hopeless) or the research
scientist; finally, for the manager.</p>
<p>Achievement for the knowledge worker is even harder to define. No one
but the knowledge worker himself can come to grips with the question of
what in work, job performance, social status, and pride constitutes the
personal satisfaction that makes a knowledge worker feel that he
contributes, that he performs, that he serves his values, and that he
fulfills himself.</p>
<p>The Segmentation of the Work Force</p>
<p>Manual workers and knowledge workers are not the only work-force
segments, however. The clerical worker who is a production worker
without being a machine worker is probably a distinct and important
group. Equally important is the fact that the work force in all
developed countries is segmenting itself according to sex.</p>
<p>Till fairly recently, women employees were essentially either
temporary, working in the interlude between school and marriage, or
distinctly lower class. Wives of “respectable” workers did not accept
employment and work outside the home. Such upper-class women as worked
were largely independent professionals, e.g., the few women doctors,
women lawyers, and women university professors. The exceptions were
schoolteachers and hospital nurses; and they either stayed unmarried or
had to quit.</p>
<p>In all developed countries—the one exception so far being Japan—this
is changing drastically. It might well be the sign of a developed
country that a very large proportion of its women work as employees. The
married middle-class woman is increasingly becoming the typical woman
employee. With family size limited and with housework greatly
reduced—both because of simpler housekeeping and because of mechanical
appliances— more and more middleand upper-class women are joining the
work force. The trend is likely to continue. The driving forces are
economic, social, and psychological, rather than</p>
<p>*On this see my book, The Age of Discontinuity.</p>
<p>“women’s lib.” But the working woman requires a different job
structure appropriate to her realities and conditions. She requires
different treatment from the male worker with respect to job, economic
rewards, and social status in the plant community. Women with children,
for example, often need part-time work or flexible hours. And for
married women retirement pensions are often of little interest compared
with higher cash incomes.</p>
<p>Various segments of the work force also have different needs with
respect to benefits.</p>
<p>When it comes to cash wages they may all consider the same rewards
“value.” But when it comes to retirement pay, housing or educational
allowances, health and other benefits, their needs and expectations vary
greatly with sex, age, and family responsibilities, with the stage in
the life cycle and that of their families, and so on.</p>
<p>Traditionally an employer, whether a business or any other
institutions has had one personnel policy. In the future there will be
need for as many personnel policies as there are segments of the work
force. Increasingly the segmentation of the work force will require
differentiated approaches to the task of making work productive, and
especially to the task of making the worker achieving.</p>
<p>There are additional shifts: the shift from manual work to
automation, and the shift within manual work to high mechanization;
rapid changes in technology which make skills; whether manual or mental,
obsolescent within a few short years and, therefore, threaten
established crafts and established knowledges; the steady lengthening of
the human life span, which makes working life increasingly a preparation
for long years of nonwork, that is, of retirement; and many others.</p>
<p>But the three main challenges to managing work and worker are: (1)
the arrival of the employee society; (2) the changed psychological and
social position of the manual worker: better educated and better paid,
he still sees himself moving down from yesterday’s self-respecting
working class into second-class citizenship; and (3) the emergence of
knowledge work and the knowledge worker as the economic and social
center of what some people now call post-industrial society.</p>
<p>The New Breed</p>
<p>It is these changes that explain the arrival of the new breed of
workers, that is, the young people, and especially the highly educated
young people, who in the developed countries are challenging the
traditional management of work and workers, traditional organization,
and traditional economic and power relationships as well.</p>
<p>This is often attributed to affluence, as the result of which, we are
being told, the old Protestant ethic is crumbling.* This is far too glib
and superficial an explanation. To be sure, affluence is something new
under the sun. Throughout all of man’s history the great majority of
people has always lived at the margin of subsistence. The great majority
never knew where its next meal was going to come from. Now, in the
developed countries, the great majority is economically secure, at least
in traditional terms. But there is no sign that the great majority—or
any but the tiniest of minorities—has lost its appetite for economic
rewards, whether material or immaterial. On the contrary, the great
majority, now that they have tasted some of the fruits of productivity,
are clearly eager for more—much more than the economy can produce so
far, if not more than the limited resources of our planet could
produce.</p>
<p>The shift in the structure and character of work has created a demand
that work produce more than purely economic benefits. To make a living
is no longer enough. Work also has to make a life.</p>
<p>The rising level of expectations rather than affluence is the central
phenomenon. This means that it will be more important than ever to make
work productive. At the same time, both the manual worker with his deep
psychological insecurity and the knowledge worker with his new and
ill-defined status expect work to provide nonmaterial psycho-</p>
<p>*It does not seem to have occurred to Western sociologists that the
strongest practitioners of the Protestant ethic have for long periods of
time been such notorious non-Calvinists as the Japanese and the
Chinese.</p>
<p>logical and social satisfactions. They do not necessarily expect work
to be enjoyable but they expect it to be achieving.</p>
