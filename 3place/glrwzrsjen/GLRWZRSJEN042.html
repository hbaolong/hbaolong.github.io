Management Sciences</h4>
<p>Management Sciences: Promise and Performance—Why Management Sciences
Do No Yet Perform—How the Management Sciences Originated—Why They Tend
to Be Unscientific—The Basic Postulates—The First Need of the Management
Sciences— The Fear of Risk-Taking—What Managers Should Expect—Testing
Assumptions— Right Questions, Not Answers—Alternatives, Not
Solutions—Understanding, Not Formulae—What the Management Sciences
Should Work On—From Potential to Performance</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>HE FIRST MANAGEMENT SCIENTIST was that long-forgotten Italian who,
very early in the Renaissance, invented double-entry bookkeeping. No
other management tool designed since can compare with it in simplicity,
elegance, and utility. Double- entry bookkeeping and all its offsprings
and variations is still the only truly universal “management science,”
the only tool of systematic analysis that every business, and in- deed
every institution, uses every day.</p>
<p>But no one ever talked of double-entry bookkeeping as management
science. That term made its appearance after World War II.* The very
term was a manifesto. “Manage- ment,” it proclaimed, “was to be made
rigorous, scientific, quantitative.” The new tools, with operations
research in the van, would substitute certainly for guesswork, knowledge
for judgment, “hard facts” for experience.</p>
<p>These were, of course, the heady days when it was widely predicted
that the computer would replace the manager. And a good many of the
management scientists, awed by their new shiny tools, similarly saw
themselves “taking over” decision-making control. Most managers have
long learned that the computer will not replace managers (see Chapter
35, “From Middle Management to Knowledge Organization”).</p>
<p>Most have learned that the computer is a tool—very useful if properly
employed, but a tool nonetheless. Most managers also know by now that
the management sciences are tools. Indeed it would have been more
prudent—let alone a little more modest—to speak of “management analysis”
rather than of “management sciences.”</p>
<p>Still, the management sciences are tools with high potential for
contribution. There is no more reason for a manager to be a management
scientist than there is reason for a phy- sician to be a blood chemist
or a bacteriologist. But a manager needs to know what to expect of the
management sciences and how to use them as managerial tools, just as the
physician needs to know what to expect of blood chemistry and
bacteriology and how to use them as diagnostic tools.</p>
<p>For this the manager first needs to understand what the management
sciences try to do—and what they should be doing. He next needs to know
what contributions to expect</p>
<p>*TIMS, The Institute of Management Sciences, which is the
professional society of the management scientists, was founded in 1953
and held its first meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1954.</p>
<p>of them. Few managers, so far, have acquired the skill of making the
management sci- ences contribute to their managerial work. Few, so far,
are putting these new tools to ef- fective work.</p>
<p>Promise and Performance</p>
<p>Most managers know that they need better tools. Most have learned by
bitter experience that intuition is unreliable, if not downright
treacherous, if used as the only basis for deci- sion. Indeed, most
experienced managers have long suspected what a leading manage- ment
scientist of today, Jay W. Forrester of M.I.T., brilliantly demonstrated
in two books:* complex systems actually behave “counter-intuitively”;
the plausible tends to be wrong. And markets, technologies, and
businesses are very complex systems indeed. There is nothing very
startling in this insight; there is nothing more plausible, after all,
than that the earth is flat or that the sun revolves around the
earth.</p>
<p>When management science first appeared it was therefore hailed by
managers with glad cries. Since then, a whole new profession has come
into being: the management sci- entists, with their own professional
associations, their own learned journals, their own departments in
universities, business schools, and schools of technology, and with good
jobs in large numbers within industry.</p>
<p>And yet, management science has been a disappointment. It has not
lived up, so far, to its promise. It certainly has not revolutionized
the practice of management. Few manag- ers, indeed, pay much attention
to it.</p>
<p>The widening gap between the claims and promises of management
science and its use by business is recognized—and deplored—by both
management scientists and managers. Not unexpectedly each blames the
other. Managers complain that management scientists concern themselves
with trivia and “reinvent the wheel.” Management scientists, in turn,
tell horror stories of “resistance by reactionary managers.”</p>
<p>There is a good deal to both complaints. But the truth is more
complex—and far more important than who is to blame.</p>
<p>Why Management Science Fails to Perform</p>
<p>There is one fundamental insight underlying all management science.
It is that the busi- ness enterprise is a system of the highest order: a
system the parts of which are human beings contributing voluntarily of
their knowledge, skill, and dedication to a joint venture. And one thing
characterizes all genuine systems, whether they be mechanical, like the
control of a missile, biological like a tree, or social like the
business enterprise: it is inter- dependence. The whole of a system is
not necessarily improved if one particular function or part is improved
or made more efficient. In fact, the system may well be damaged thereby,
or even destroyed. In some cases the best way to strengthen the system
may be to weaken a part—to make it less precise or less efficient. For
what matters in any system is the performance of the whole; this is the
result of growth and of dynamic balance, adjust- ment, and integration
rather than of mere technical efficiency.</p>
<p>Primary emphasis on the efficiency of parts in management science is
therefore bound to do damage. It is bound to optimize precision of the
tool at the expense of the health and performance of the whole. (That
the enterprise is a social rather than a mechanical system makes the
danger all the greater, for the other parts do not stand still. They
either respond so as to spread the maladjustment throughout the system
or organize for sabotage.)</p>
<p>But when we look at the actual work done by management scientists in
business, we find little that lives up to the basic insight with which
management science starts out.</p>
<p>The bulk of the work done so far concerns itself with the sharpening
of already exist- ing tools for specific technical functions—such as
quality control or inventory control, warehouse location or freight-car
allocation, machine loading, maintenance scheduling, or order handling.
A good deal of the work is little more than a refinement of industrial
en-</p>
<ul>
<li>Urban Dynamics (M.I.T. Press, 1969) and World Dynamics (Wright-Allen
Press, 1971).</li>
</ul>
<p>gineering, cost accounting, or procedures analysis. Some, though not
very much, attention has been given to the analysis and improvement of
functional efforts—primarily those of the manufacturing function but
also, to some extent, of marketing and of money manage- ment.</p>
<p>But there has been little work, little organized thought, little
emphasis on managing an enterprise—on the risk-making, risk-taking,
decision-making job. Throughout manage- ment science—in the literature
as well as in the work in progress—the emphasis is on techniques rather
than on principles, on mechanics rather than on decisions, on tools
rather than on results, and, above all, on efficiency of the part rather
than on performance of the whole.</p>
<p>Technically this is all excellent work. But therein lies its danger.
The new tools are so much more powerful than the old tools of technical
and functional work—the tools of trial and error and of cut and fit—that
their wrong or careless use must do damage.</p>
<p>There are a few significant exceptions. At the General Electric
Company almost twenty years of effort have led to the development of
genuine models of whole businesses showing their basic economic
characteristics and principal interrelationships. Similar work has been
done at the British Coal Board. The potential is there, in other
words.</p>
<p>But most of the actual work has concerned itself with doing a little
better what we al- ready know how to do. We did control inventories,
after all, or allocate freight cars, well before the advent of
management science. And it is unlikely that any business will survive
rather than die, or prosper rather than languish, because we now know
how to do these things better—even significantly better.</p>
<p>W hat explains this under-use—or misuse—of such potentially powerful
tools?</p>
<p>The first clue lies, perhaps, in the origin of the management
sciences—and the origin is an unusual one indeed. Every other discipline
of man began with a crude attempt to define what its subject was. Then
people set to work fashioning concepts and tools for its study. But the
management sciences began with the application of concepts and tools de-
veloped within a host of other disciplines for their own particular
purposes. It may have started with the heady discovery that certain
mathematical techniques, hitherto applied to the study of the physical
universe, could also be applied to the study of business opera-
tions.</p>
<p>As a result, the focus of much of the work in the management sciences
has not been on such questions as “What is the business enterprise?”
“What is managing?” “What do the two do, and what do the two need?”
Rather, the focus has been “Where can I apply my beautiful gimmick?” The
emphasis has been on the hammer rather than on driving in the nail, let
alone on building the house. In the literature of operations research,
for instance, there are several dissertations along the lines of “155
applications of linear program- ming,” but I have not seen any published
study on “typical business opportunities and their characteristics.”</p>
<p>What this indicates is a serious misunderstanding on the part of the
management sci- entist of what “scientific” means. Scientific is not—as
many management scientists na- ively seem to think—synonymous with
quantification. If this were true, astrology would be the queen of the
sciences. It is not even the application of the scientific method. After
all, astrologers observe phenomena, derive the generalization of a
hypothesis therefrom, and then test the hypothesis by further organized
observation. Yet astrology is superstition rather than science because
of its childish assumption that there is a real zodiac, that the signs
in it really exist, and that their fancied resemblance to some such
earthly creature as a fish or a lion defines their character and
properties (whereas all of them are nothing but the mnemonic devices of
the navigators of antiquity).</p>
<p>In other words, “scientific” presupposes a rational definition of the
universe of the science (that is, of the phenomena which it considers to
be real and meaningful) as well as the formulation of basic assumptions
or postulates which are appropriate, consistent, and comprehensive. This
job of defining the universe of a science and of setting its basic pos-
tulates has to be done, however crudely, before the scientific method
can be applied. If it</p>
<p>is not done, or done wrongly, the scientific method cannot be
applied. If it is done, and done right, the scientific method becomes
applicable and indeed powerful.</p>
<p>Management science still has to do this job of defining its universe.
If it does this, then all the work done so far will become fruitful—at
least as preparation and training ground for real achievement. The first
task for management science, if it is to be able to contrib- ute rather
than distort and mislead, is therefore to define the specific nature of
its subject matter.</p>
<p>This might include as a basic definition the insight that the
business enterprise is made up of human beings. The assumptions,
opinions, objectives, and even the errors of people (and especially of
managers) are thus primary facts for the management scientist. Any
effective work in management science really has to begin with analysis
and study of them.</p>
<p>Starting, then, with this recognition of what there is to be studied,
management science must next establish its basic assumptions and
postulates.</p>
<p>It might first include the vital fact that every business enterprise
exists in the economy and in society; that even the mightiest is the
servant of its environment, by which it can be dismissed without
ceremony, but that even the lowliest affects and molds the economy and
society instead of just adapting to them; in other words, that the
business enterprise exists only in an economic and social ecology of
great complexity.</p>
<p>The basic postulates might further include the following ideas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The business enterprise produces neither things nor ideas but
humanly determined values. The most beautifully designed machine is
still only so much scrap metal until it has utility for a
customer.</p></li>
<li><p>Measurements in the business enterprise are such complex, not to
say metaphysical, symbols as money—at the same time both highly abstract
and amazingly concrete.</p></li>
<li><p>Economic activity, of necessity, is the commitment of present
resources to an un- knowable and uncertain future—a commitment, in other
words, to expectations rather than to facts. Risk is of the essence, and
risk-making and risk-taking constitute the basic function of enterprise.
And risks are taken not only by the general manager, but right through
the whole organization by everybody who contributes knowledge—that is,
by every manager and professional specialist. This risk is something
quite different from risk in the statistician’s probability; it is the
risk of the unique event, the irreversible qualita- tive breaking of the
pattern.</p></li>
<li><p>Inside and outside the business enterprise there is constant
irreversible change; in- deed, the business enterprise exists as the
agent of change in an industrial society, and it must be capable both of
purposeful evolution to adapt to new conditions and of purpose- ful
innovation to change the conditions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Some of this is often said in the prefaces of books on the management
sciences. It generally stays in the preface, however. Yet for the
management sciences to contribute to business understanding, let alone
become “sciences,” postulates like the foregoing ought to be the fabric
of its work. Of course we need quantification—though it tends to come
fairly late in the development of a discipline (only now, for instance,
can scientists really quantify in biology). We need the scientific
method. And we need work on specific areas and operations—careful,
meticulous detail work. But above all, we need to recognize the
particular character of business enterprise and the unique postulates
necessary for its study. It is on this vision that we must build.</p>
<p>The first need of a management science is, then, that it respect
itself sufficiently as a distinct and genuine discipline.</p>
<p>The Fear of Risk-Taking</p>
<p>The second clue to what is lacking in the management sciences as
applied today is the emphasis throughout its literature and throughout
its work on “minimizing risk” or even on “eliminating risk” as the goal
and ultimate purpose of its work.</p>
<p>To try to eliminate risk in business enterprise is futile. Risk is
inherent in the commit- ment of present resources to future
expectations. Indeed, economic progress can be de-</p>
<p>fined as the ability to take greater risks. The attempt to eliminate
risks, even the attempt to minimize them, can only make them irrational
and unbearable. It can only result in that greatest risk of all:
rigidity.</p>
<p>The main goal of a management science must be to enable business to
take the right risk. Indeed, it must be to enable business to take
greater risks—by providing knowledge and understanding of alternative
risks and alternative expectations; by identifying the re- sources and
efforts needed for desired results; by mobilizing energies for
contribution; and by measuring results against expectations, thereby
providing means for early correc- tion of wrong or inadequate
decisions.</p>
<p>All this may sound like mere quibbling over terms. Yet the
terminology of risk mini- mization does induce a decided animus against
risk-taking and risk-making—that is, against business enterprise—in the
literature of the management sciences. Much of it ech- oes the tone of
the technocrats of a generation ago. For it wants to subordinate
business to technique, and it seems to see economic activity as a sphere
of physical determination rather than as an affirmation and exercise of
responsible freedom and decision.</p>
<p>This is worse than being wrong. This is lack of respect for one’s
subject matter—the one thing no science can afford and no scientist can
survive. Even the best and most seri- ous work of good and serious
people—and there is no lack of them in the management sciences—is bound
to be vitiated by it.</p>
<p>The second requirement for a management science is, then. that it
take its subject matter seriously.</p>
<p>What Managers Need to Know</p>
<p>But managers too share in the blame for the gap between the potential
and the actual con- tribution of the management sciences. And by and
large, the manager’s share may be the greater one, and the contribution
he needs to make—and has not made—the truly crucial need of management
science and management scientist.</p>
<p>However, the management scientist’s typical complaint about the
manager is, bluntly, nonsense. It is the complaint that the manager does
not bother to learn management sci- ence and remains ignorant. To demand
of any tool user that he understand what goes into the making of the
tool is admission of incompetence on the part of the tool maker. The
tool user, provided the tool is made well, need not, and indeed should
not, know anything about the tool.</p>
<p>The basic problem is much more serious than the unwillingness of
managers to learn a few mathematical techniques. Managers, by and large,
have failed to take managerial re- sponsibility for management
scientists and management sciences. They have refused to accept the fact
that the management scientist, like any other high-grade specialist, de-
pends on the manager for his direction and his effectiveness. They have
left the manage- ment sciences unmanaged—and are therefore largely
responsible for their degenerating into a box of tricks, a “management
gadget bag” of answers to non-existing questions in many cases.</p>
<p>Managers, despite all their apparent enthusiasm for the management
sciences when they first made their appearance, have not, as a rule,
thought through what the manage- ment sciences should or could
contribute.</p>
<p>We know, by and large, what managers need: a systematic supply of
organized knowl- edge for the risk-making and risk-taking decisions of
business enterprise in a complex and rapidly changing technology,
economy, and society.</p>
<p>Tools for the measurement of expectations and results: effective
means for common vision and communication among the many functional and
professional specialists, each with his own knowledge, his own logic,
and his own language, whose combined efforts are needed, however, to
make the right business decisions, to make them effective, and to
produce results.</p>
<p>Managers need something teachable and learnable if only because our
world needs for too many people with managerial vision and competence to
depend on the intuition of a</p>
<p>few “natural-born” geniuses; and only the generalizations and
concepts of a discipline can really be learned or taught.</p>
<p>This becomes clear when one looks at the few places where management
sciences have produced results. In every single case this is not because
the management scientists have done anything they are not doing every
place. It is because managers have asked the right questions and have
managed the management sciences.</p>
<p>One example is a large manufacturer with a broad product line,
selling directly to the public through thousands of outlets, such as
department stores, discount chains, and hardware stores. Its executives
came to their management scientists and said, “Everybody in this
industry knows that extending credit to wholesalers and retailers is the
way to get sales. And everybody also knows that there is a point where
the additional credit risks outbalance the additional sales. Are these
the right assumptions on which to base our sell- ing and credit
policies?” The management scientists came back six months later and
said, “No, these are the wrong assumptions. What everybody knows is, as
so often happens, not true. What is true is that in our industry you can
get additional sales by extending credit to the biggest and best
customers who are also good credit risks, and to the smallest and worst
customers who are also the poorest credit risks. You cannot get
additional sales by extending credit to the ‘average’ customer who is
also an ‘average’ credit risk.” As a re- sult, the company completely
changed its policy. It cut off credit from the small ac- counts—and
while it lost some sales, it greatly improved its selling and credit
perform- ance. And it extended credit to its big and best accounts. The
total amount of credit it now extends is actually less than what it used
to extend when it had a very tight credit policy. But it now has a
rational understanding of the relationship between credit, sales, and
credit risk.</p>
<p>Even more instructive perhaps is the case of one large big-city
hospital which asked its management scientists, “Can you find any
pattern in the patient load which would en- able us to schedule basic
services of the hospital and to plan ahead for the utilization of
services, facilities, and staff? This is our basic problem. But we do
not even know whether we are asking the right questions.” The management
scientists, after about two years of hard work, could show that there
are predictable patterns, both long range and short range. It is
possible to predict, with high probability, the use of scarce
facilities, such as X-ray rooms, X-ray technicians, medical
laboratories, operating rooms, and so on, as well as the length of stay
of patients and thereby utilization of room and bed capacity. But they
also said, “In one area you are not asking the right questions: what
kind of beds do we need and how many of them? All the beds in the
hospital are beds for seriously sick people, that is, beds requiring
high capital investment; yet no more than one-third of the patients at
any one time require this kind of a bed and this kind of facility.
Another third require what, in effect, are convalescent beds, with a
capital investment no more than half that of the acute-sickness bed; and
yet another third require probably nothing but a motel mom with a
minimum of service and a minimum of capital investment.”</p>
<p>What managers, in other words, need to do to make management science
capable of contribution is to think through the areas in which they need
to have basic assumptions tested.</p>
<p>Managers expect management scientists to come up with answers where
nobody has asked them the right question. They expect the management
scientist, that is, a technical specialist, to know better than a
manager what the needs, the problems, the questions of a business
are.</p>
<p>Above all, they expect final answers. But the great strength of
management science— whether its methods be those of the physical
sciences, of economics, or of the social sci- ences (and a good
management scientist needs to be at home in all three areas) is its ca-
pacity for, asking questions. The manager himself will have to give
answers. For answers in business are always judgment, always choice
between alternatives of different and yet uncertain risks, always a
blend of knowledge, experience, and hopes.</p>
<p>To make the management sciences capable of contribution, the manager
has to de- mand of them that they identify the right questions to ask.
Managers, as a rule, expect the</p>
<p>management sciences to come up with one best solution. But what the
management sci- ences should be able to contribute are the alternatives
available to the manager. They should be expected to say, “Here are four
or five different courses of action. Not one of them is perfect. Each
has its own risks, its own uncertainties, its own limitations, and its
own costs. Each of them, however, satisfies at least some of the major
specifications. You, the manager, will have to choose between them. You
will have to decide on one of them, at least as the lesser evil. Which
one you choose is your decision. It is your judg- ment regarding the
risks the company can take. It is your judgment with respect to the
things you can sacrifice and the things you have to insist on. But at
least you now know what choices are available to you.”</p>
<p>There are no “solutions” with respect to the future. There are only
choices between courses of action, each imperfect, each risky, each
uncertain, and each requiring different efforts and involving different
costs. But nothing could help the manager more than to realize what
alternatives are available to him and what they imply. And this the
manage- ment scientist can supply with varying degrees of precision.</p>
<p>Finally the manager should expect his management scientists to
provide understanding rather than formulae. The formulae are the tools
of the management scientist and are of little interest to the manager.
If he cannot assume that the management scientist knows his craft, he
better get himself another management scientist. But understanding, that
is, in- sight into what a decision is really about, is something he
should hold the management scientist accountable for. What the
management sciences can contribute—and should be expected to
contribute—is understanding that a certain decision, while it looks like
a de- cision on manufacturing, is really a decision on marketing. It is
a decision on what cus- tomers will want, will be willing to pay for,
will buy. What a manager should expect from his management scientists is
to hear, “Look, the problem you assigned us is the wrong problem. This
is the problem we ought to be working on.”</p>
<p>The greatest contribution a group of management scientists made to
the pharmaceuti- cal company which employed them was not solutions. It
was to say to management, “All your efforts, all your energies, all your
attention are focused on the new products. But three-quarters of your
income today and for the foreseeable future will come from drugs that
have been in the inventory at least three years. Nobody manages them,
nobody sells them, nobody knows what to do with them. In fact, nobody
has the s1ightest interest in them. The only thing we know is that the
way to keep old drugs in the market is com- pletely different from what
is needed to introduce new ones. But what managing an exist- ing product
line of old and established drugs requires we do not know. This,
however, is what we should be studying.”</p>
<p>These four demands and expectations:</p>
<p>are the keys to making the management sciences productive. They all
are based on the assumption that the management sciences are not methods
of computation but tools of analysis. They all assume that the purpose
of the management sciences is to help with diagnosis. They are insights
and not prescription, let alone wonder drugs.</p>
<p>But they all require also that the manager take responsibility for
the management sci- ences. They all require that the manager manage
these tools. They all require of the man- ager that he decide, in close
working relationship with the management scientists, what the management
scientists should go to work on. They should not go to work on the
things that are interesting to the management scientists and easily
amenable to their tools. They should go to work on the areas in which a
manager needs understanding. And if these areas are areas in which the
tools are not particularly appropriate, areas, for in-</p>
<p>stance, in which quantification is difficult or perhaps even
impossible, this should not deter manager or management scientists.
Insight, understanding, ranking of priorities, and a “feel” for the
complexity of an area are as important as precise, beautifully elegant
mathematical models—and in fact usually infinitely more useful and
indeed even more “scientific.” They reflect the reality of the manager’s
universe and of his tasks.</p>
<p>It is up to the manager to convert the management sciences from
potential to perform- ance. To do this he has to understand what the
management sciences are and what they can do. He has to understand the
peculiar limitations which are inherent in the manage- ment sciences
largely as a result of their origin and history. But above all he has to
under- stand that the management sciences are the manager’s tools, and
not the tools of the man- agement scientist. And it is up to the manager
to focus these tools on managerial tasks and direct them toward
managerial contributions.</p>
