<h4 id="on-being-the-right-size">53 On Being the Right Size*</h4>
<p>The Law of Surface and Mass—Size and Complexity—Why Changes in Size
are “Quantum Jumps” —Size and Strategy—Size and Complexity as
Top-Management Tasks</p>
<p>he surface diameter’s</p>
<p>of any object increases with the square of its diameter, the mass
with the cube. As the diameter goes from 2 to 3 to 4, the mass goes from
8 to 27 to</p>
<p>64, while the surface increases only from 4 to 9 to 16.</p>
<p>This elementary law of geometry is of profound importance to
management. It means that size, structure, and strategy are closely
related. Different sizes require different struc- tures, different
policies, different strategies, and different behaviors. There are right
sizes and wrong sizes for different businesses. The law implies that
there is a finite limit to size beyond which an organization declines in
productivity and ultimately ceases to be man- ageable. It finally
implies that changes in size are not continuous but that, at a point in
growth, there has to be an “evolutionary leap,” a genuine
transformation.</p>
<p>For biological organisms, the implications of the law of surface and
mass were worked out by a British biologist.† Thompson proved that
beyond a point in size—and a fairly early one at that—the hardened skin
of the insect can no longer support the mass. A skele- ton is required.
Thompson also proved that there are finite limits to size. If the
elephant were to grow much larger, legs sturdy enough to support the
animal’s weight would be too massive to be lifted.</p>
<p>Social organisms may be far too complex to allow neat quantitative
formulae for their sizes.‡ But in a social organism, too, “mass” always
increases much faster than “surface.” “Weight,” too, therefore goes up
faster than the supporting structure. As a result, changes in size are
not merely quantitative. They are changes in quality. There are, as a
result, “right” and “wrong” sizes; that is, sizes which require a
structure that is appropriate to performance and function, and sizes in
which the structure needed to support the mass is inadequate or
inappropriate and becomes an impediment. And there is a finite limit to
size. There are organizations that are simply too big to function (as
Gallant and Prothero tried to demonstrate for the giant university).</p>
<p>The law of surface and mass implies an inescapable relationship
between size and complexity. The bigger the organism grows, the further
away will be the bulk of its mass from the outside environment. The more
will it therefore need specialized and complex</p>
<p>*With apologies to J.B.S. Haldane, whose 1928 essay of the same title
on biological organisms remains the most perceptive discussion of the
relationship between size, function, and structure.</p>
<p>†D’Arcy Thompson, On Growth and Form (Cambridge, 1917).</p>
<p>‡The first attempt to work out a “law of size” for social structures
is an article, “Weight Watching at the Uni- versity: The Consequence of
Growth,” by J. A. Gallant and J. W. Prothero (Science, Vol. 175, No:
4020, Janu- ary 28, 1972). The authors concluded that a university
becomes too large to educate students and to be man- ageable once it
grows beyond 15,000 to 20,000 students in enrollment.</p>
<p>organs to supply it with the essentials of life. Again, there is a
finite limit to complexity. Beyond a certain point the complexity
becomes more than structure, no matter how de- signed, can support.</p>
<p>The human body, for instance, has reached the limit of its evolution
with respect to brain size. Were the brain to become bigger or more
complex, the oxygen supply needed to sustain it would require such high
blood pressure as to kill man in order to keep him alive.</p>
<p>In social organization, such as a business, growth in size soon
requires disproportion- ate increase in complexity and more and more
specialized organs. Soon organs have to be developed that take care of
the “inside,” that is, organs that inform and direct the increas- ing
mass and “feed back” to it from the increasingly remote outside the
results of its own “inside” activities. The larger any body, physical or
social, becomes, the more of its en- ergy will be needed to keep the
“inside” that is, its own mechanisms, alive and function- ing. Again,
mere quantity soon becomes a change in qual.ity.</p>
<p>The reciprocal relationship also holds. The more complex the
organization, the more does it have to be organized on the structural
principle of larger size. Size determines complexity. But complexity, in
turn, determines size. The law of surface and mass implies that change
from one kind of size to another, or from one kind of complexity to
another, is not continuous. It is a “threshold” phenomenon. There is a
point at which a transforma- tion has to take place.</p>
<p>The skeleton of the higher animals did not evolve out of the insect’s
hard skin. And the early hominoids, our remote ancestors, had to develop
a brain a good deal larger than their own needs required before they
could make the next evolutionary step to walking upright, to making
tools, or to using fire.</p>
<p>Beyond a point in size or complexity quantity demands a “quantum
jump,” a trans- formation in quality rather than a mere addition.</p>
<p>This is what Henry Ford failed to understand when he believed that he
could continue to run his company without management and managers
despite its giant size. For man- agement is an “evolutionary leap.” It
did not evolve from the single proprietor any more than the skeleton
evolved from the insect’s hard skin.</p>
<p>This is what people usually do not understand when they talk of
“delegation,” that is, when they imply that managers do their job as
part of the job of top management or as part of the job of the board of
directors. “Delegation” always implies that the delegator can take back
the delegated task. But the cells of the higher animals cannot take back
the function of the brain. It is not delegated, but is an autonomous
function of its own.</p>
<p>Similarly, every managerial job, if properly designed, is not
delegated but is a function of its own with its own authority. It is the
result of an evolutionary leap rather than an extension of what is
already being done.</p>
<p>Size and Strategy</p>
<p>Size by itself has major impact on strategy. And strategy, in turn,
has major impact on size. The small organization can do things the large
ones cannot do. Its simplicity and its small size should give it fast
response, agility, and the ability to focus its resources. But the large
organization, in turn, also can do things the small organization cannot
do. It can commit resources for a much longer time, for instance, to
long-term research projects which are beyond the staying power of the
small business. The question “What strategies befit different sizes?” is
thus of crucial importance to top management.</p>
<p>But, in turn, different strategies also require different sizes. A
business that aims at a leadership position in a major, let alone a
worldwide, market, clearly has to be a large business. But even in a big
market, a business which aims at filling a special and limited niche
better remain small.</p>
<p>One example of such a business would be Rolls-Royce, which in one of
the world’s largest markets, the automobile market, has carved out for
itself a small but exceedingly</p>
<p>profitable niche where it is practically without competition, but
where it also cannot grow beyond modest size.*</p>
<p>The relationship between size and strategy is further complicated by
the fact that the “big” business may actually be a confederation of
fair-sized or even of small businesses, each with its own strategies and
its own markets. Then the business needs to think through in effect two
strategies, a number of “small-business strategies” for each of its
constituent units, and a “big business strategy” for the business
overall. Complexity then becomes a major factor.</p>
<p>The individual employee, whether rank-and-file or managerial, is not
primarily af- fected by the questions of size and complexity. The worker
on the machine, the key-punch operator, the billing clerk, the
heat-treating specialist, or the plant manager do the same job whether
the company is small or huge, simple or complex. Size and complexity be-
come problems, first, in the upper reaches of middle management and
especially for sen- ior professionals. They affect their world, yet
they, in turn, have little impact on, and prac- tically no
responsibility for, the decisions on size and complexity.</p>
<p>Size and complexity are above all top-management problems and require
top- management decisions.</p>
<p>Public-service institutions also stand under the laws of size and
complexity. For them too (as mentioned earlier with respect to the
university) there is a right size and a wrong size. This also applies to
“service staff” within a business. That a “conscience activity” requires
small size, and preferably a one-man staff; was argued earlier (Chapter
42). A staff that is supposed to teach and to innovate in a functional
area—marketing, for in- stance, or the management of people—had better
be small, otherwise its internal complex- ity will force its ablest
people to become “administrators” instead of being teachers and
innovators. And in a staff service within an organization, size and
structure should always be adjusted to fit the needs of the desired
strategy and to serve the objectives of the work. In a staff service,
above all, size and complexity must be managed—or strategy and ob-
jectives suffer.</p>
<p>Top management needs to know, first, what size its company is. Top
management needs to know what size its business should be. It needs to
know whether its business is the right size or the wrong size. It needs
to know whether the structure is appropriate to the company’s size and
complexity. It needs to know what top management’s own job is in
companies of different sizes and complexities.</p>
<p>And it needs to relate size and complexity to company strategy. It
might have to de- cide that the company, as it now stands, is not
capable of carrying out its strategy. It may even have to decide that
the company, as it now stands, is not viable because it is of an
incurably wrong size. And top management needs to know what follows from
such find- ings and what alternatives of strategy and behavior are
available to the company. For, unlike biological organisms, a social
organization such as a business does not have a size entirely determined
by forces over which it has no control.</p>
<p>There are minimum sizes below which a business in a given industry or
market is sim- ply not viable. There are maximum sizes beyond which a
business, no matter how well managed, will not, in the long run,
prosper. But in between—and the range is very wide indeed—size and
complexity have to be considered as “business objectives.” Like all
other objectives they are not “under the control” of management in the
sense that what is desirable is also, therefore, attainable, let alone
already achieved. Like all other business objectives, attaining the
right size requires hard thinking and serious, consistent work.</p>
<p>*This refers, of course, only to the Rolls-Royce automobile business.
The Rolls-Royce aircraft business, which caused the company’s bankruptcy
in 1971, is, however, also an example of the relationship between size
and strategy. For here, Rolls-Royce suffered from being far too small in
size and resources for the leadership role it aimed at in the world’s
jet-engine business. In the aircraft-engine market Rolls-Royce was the
“wrong size.”</p>
<p>Specifically, there are five major areas to be considered:</p>
<p>1 Managing smallness and bigness—that is, the management requirements
of size by itself. “How big is big?” “What are ‘right’ sizes and what
are ‘wrong’ sizes?” “What are the limits beyond which further growth is
degenerative?” And, “What are the implications of size for business
strategy?”</p>
<p>2 The second major area is the management of complexity and
diversity. “How complex is complex?” “How complex is too complex?” And,
“What re- quirements does complexity make?”</p>
<p>A separate problem in complexity that deserves some discussion is
that of the limits on the family-owned business. “Can it perpetuate
itself?” “Can it grow beyond small size?” And, “What are its limits in
time and size?”</p>
<p>3 A special case of complexity, so important as to deserve a separate
chapter, is the most complex of business organizations, the
multinational corporation. For here is added to complexities of size,
markets, products, and technolo- gies, the complexities of cultures and
the complexities of multiple political and governmental relationships
and restraints.</p>
<p>4 Managing change and growth is the next major topic. “At what point
in change and growth does management have to change its characteristics,
its structure, its behavior?” And, “How can it prepare itself so that it
is ready for change and for growth without, at the same time,
overloading the company with functions and complexities which, at the
present state of the business, it does not require and can ill
afford?”</p>
<p>5 Managing innovation is a topic in itself. “Man is the only animal
capable of purposeful evolution; he makes tools.” This insight of Alfred
Russel Wallace, co-discoverer with Darwin of the principle of evolution,
means that man and his social organizations can innovate. They can
create, so to speak, a differ- ent animal. Indeed, in a changing
environment their survival depends on their capacity to innovate. What
does an innovative organization have to be and how does it have to be
structured and managed?</p>
<p>It is with these topics that the next chapters will, concern
themselves.</p>
